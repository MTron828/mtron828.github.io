Chapter 884: She Can’t Make It Up to You Just Because She Wants to

With that, Bai Yusheng turned around and instructed his assistant. “Seal the news from the scene and notify everyone. No one is to leak this matter. If I find out that someone secretly released the news and finds out who it is, don’t blame me for being merciless.

“They can forget about staying in the industry in the future.”

The assistant nodded and went to make the arrangements.

Bai Yusheng called the hospital again and got someone to drive the car over.

Everyone seemed to have just found their backbone.

Even Michael seemed less anxious.

Soon, under Bai Yusheng’s arrangement, the group rushed to the hospital with Tu Yilei.

Qiao Mianmian also went.

...

Qiao Mianmian followed Bai Yusheng to the hospital.

Tu Yilei and the rest were in another car.

Qiao Mianmian and Bai Yusheng were in the same car.

After getting into the car, Qiao Mianmian kept quiet and turned to look out of the window.

The image of Tu Yilei being splashed with sulfuric acid and the back of his hand being corroded by it kept appearing in her mind.

She didn’t know if those burns could be treated.

If he didn’t recover...

She didn’t dare to think about the consequences.

For a top-tier celebrity like Tu Yilei, a wounded hand would have a huge impact on his career.

“What are you thinking about?” Bai Yusheng could tell that she was in a bad mood. Moreover, before they went over, he’d heard that Tu Yilei’s hand was probably injured. Looking at her now, he knew that she was definitely worried about him.

Qiao Mianmian kept quiet for a while more before sighing.

“Brother Bai, did you know that Tu Yilei’s hand was splashed with sulfuric acid because he shielded me?” Qiao Mianmian covered her face, feeling frustrated and upset. “Huang Yilin came and begged me to let her off. I didn’t agree to it, so she took out sulfuric acid to splash it on me.

“At that time, Tu Yilei pushed me away and stood in front of me...”

She sounded a little choked up. “The sulfuric acid was splashed on his hand. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“He’s injured so badly, what if he can’t recover...

“I suddenly owe him such a huge favor, but I don’t know how to repay him. If his hand doesn’t recover well, it’ll definitely affect his future career. Brother Bai, what do you think I should do?

“No matter how much I think about it, I can’t make it up to him.”

This favor was too huge.

She couldn’t make it up to him just because she wanted to.

How could he be so silly?

Why did he have to shield her?

She felt terrible.

She was the one who harmed Tu Yilei.

Bai Yusheng turned to look at her and thought for a while before stopping the car.

“Mianmian, you’re blaming yourself for this, right? You think you’ve hurt him, and you’re letting him down?”

Qiao Mianmian’s eyes reddened as she nodded. “Mm.”

Bai Yusheng looked at the girl’s reddened eyes and nose and sighed. He patted her head and comforted her. “But this isn’t your fault. You don’t have to blame yourself.”

“It’s not my fault?” Qiao Mianmian blinked as if she didn’t understand. She choked and said, “Brother Bai, don’t console me. How could it not be my fault? If it wasn’t for me, he wouldn’t have been hurt.”
