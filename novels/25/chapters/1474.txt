Chapter 1477: The Boss Is Not a Good Person

But now Qiao Anxin had turned from a shameless mistress to an innocent victim.

Qiao Mianmian took out her cell phone and scrolled through Weibo, looking at the two posts Qiao Anxin posted.

After reading them, her reaction was much calmer than Nana’s.

Nana couldn’t understand her reaction. “Mianmian, aren’t you angry? Don’t you think she’s shameless?”

Qiao Mianmian’s reaction was calm because she knew that Qiao Anxin wouldn’t be so calm.

As long as she wanted to continue in the entertainment industry, she would definitely find a way to clear her name.

Hence, she wasn’t surprised at all.

Qiao Anxin’s method was indeed effective.

She first admitted to interfering in her relationship with Su Ze, and then said that she didn’t know about it.

Coupled with such a pitiful video, it was easy to feel sympathy for her.

And even if Su Ze saw her Weibo and denied it, she could say that he didn’t want to admit it.

In any case, it had been so long, and no one could prove that she was lying.

No matter what, this step of hers was a success.

“What’s the point of being angry? I’ll post on Weibo like her and say that she’s lying? She signed with a new agency, so she has to clear her name first. I’ve already expected this.”

“But... but...” Nana frowned. “Is there nothing we can do about her? I just feel that she’s too shameless to clear her name after stealing your boyfriend.”

Qiao Mianmian was still calm. “Do you know anything about her new agency?”

An agency dared to sign Qiao Anxin before she was completely cleared of her guilt.

“Are you talking about Qiao Anxin’s new company?” Nana tilted her head and thought for a while before nodding. “I have some understanding of it. It can be considered a pretty good agency. Of course, even though it’s not as big as Huan Yu and Star Splendor, it’s better than most.

“But...”

“But what?”

Nana paused for a while before saying, “I heard that the boss of this agency isn’t a good person. All the female artistes signed into the company have been... gone through by him. He’s famous for his bad reputation in this field.

“I wonder if Qiao Anxin has been...”

Nana didn’t say it directly.

Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

At this moment, someone walked towards them.

It was Bai Yusheng accompanied by a few unfamiliar faces. He introduced them to Qiao Mianmian. “Mianmian, this is Xue Shiya’s daily representative, Mr. Zhang.

“Mr. Zhang, this is my actress, Qiao Mianmian.”

“Hello, Miss Qiao.” The man walking in front of Bai Yusheng extended his hand and said politely, “I’m Xue Shiya’s Country A Sales General Manager, Zhang Hai. Our company has taken a liking to Miss Qiao’s popularity and wants to sign an endorsement for a new product. I wonder if Miss Qiao is interested?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Qiao Mianmian looked at his hand and shook it.

“Hello, Mr. Zhang.”

Qiao Mianmian blinked and asked with uncertainty, “You said that your company has taken a liking to my popularity?”
