Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“We should teach her a lesson so that she won’t dare to offend Chairman Gong again.”

“Then, what kind of lesson should we teach her?” Gong Zeli asked.

Su Ze thought for a while, and a trace of viciousness flashed past his eyes. He gritted his teeth and said, “I’ll give her a taste of her own medicine. She spread rumors and damaged Chairman Gong’s reputation, so we’ll use the same means to ruin her reputation.”

“Oh? She’s your ex-girlfriend. You’re willing to use this trick on her?”

“I don’t have any feelings for her anymore. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have broken up with her back then.”

Su Ze paused for a while before saying sincerely, “Chairman Gong, please give me a chance to make it up to you. I’ll definitely give you a satisfactory answer.”

Gong Zeli smiled and kept quiet for a while before saying calmly, “We’ll only know if I am satisfied after you do it.”

Su Ze was stunned for a moment. When he understood what Gong Zeli meant, he quickly said, “Chairman Gong, don’t worry. I’ll definitely do it to your satisfaction.”

Gong Zeli looked at his elated expression and smiled. “Alright, I’ll give you a week. If you don’t settle this, you don’t have to stay in the Gong Corporation anymore.”

How could Su Ze know that Gong Zeli had already dug a hole for him to jump into?

…

Bai Yusheng and Qiao Chen quickly sent all the evidence to her.

Qiao Mianmian looked at the evidence and felt that it was enough to kill Qiao Anxin.

She sent the evidence to Linda, who then handed it to the public relations department.

Not long after, Huan Yu’s Public Relations Department wrote a professional and simple statement.

Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and didn’t post it on Weibo immediately.

She felt that since she wanted to expose Qiao Anxin, she had to make it impossible for her to make a comeback.

She had to hammer her to death.

Although she had enough evidence now, she wanted it to be foolproof.

It didn’t take her much effort to find out where Qiao Anxin was staying.

She took a day off from the production crew and booked a flight to Yuncheng City. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

…

Three hours later, Qiao Mianmian arrived in Yuncheng City.

She didn’t tell Mo Yesi that she was back. She immediately took a taxi to Qiao Anxin’s place.

According to the address she found, Qiao Anxin was living in a high-class district.

Coincidentally, Qiao Mianmian had a property there.

It was a part of the assets that Mother Bai gave her.

When Qiao Mianmian arrived at the district, the security guard at the door didn’t stop her. Instead, he greeted her respectfully.

Finding it strange, Qiao Mianmian asked, “You know me?”

This was her first time in this neighborhood.

Not everyone could enter such a high-end district. She thought that a stranger like her would definitely be questioned.

“This is the Bai family’s property. Everyone in the property industry knows that Miss Qiao is the Bai family’s daughter. Moreover, I’ve seen the television series you acted in, so I’m not unfamiliar with you.”

“I see.”

Qiao Mianmian cleared her doubts and nodded. “Can I enter directly?”

“Of course, Miss Qiao can enter as she pleases.”
