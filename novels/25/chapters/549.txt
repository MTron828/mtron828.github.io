Chapter 550: I Cannot Stand Being Given the Cold Shoulder

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

She didn’t even need to step forward. He had taken the initiative to get rid of other potential rivals for her.

Even someone like Shen Rou who had been with him for over 20 years was being taken down just like that.

Although this was exactly what a married man should do...

Not many were actually this proactive.

He was considerably very self-aware.

That alone deserved a reward from Qiao Mianmian.

Mo Yesi was looking at Shen Rou, completely unfazed in the face of her tears. He was so cold that even Qiao Mianmian felt that he was a little too heartless. “Since you know I don’t wish to see you, what are you doing here?”

The tone he used was so icy, even Qiao Mianmian’s hair stood on end. “Mianmian is my wife, of course, I have the time for her whenever she’s here. Shen Rou, I don’t think I need to tell you the difference between a friend and a wife. You don’t have to compare yourself to Mianmian. Your places in my heart are different, to begin with.

“And...” He ignored Shen Rou’s ghastly expression, picked up his mug, and looked at the lipstick stain Qiao Mianmian had left on the rim. “In the future, don’t act as if you know me well in front of my wife. If she misunderstands anything, I’ll have to take a long time to coax and convince her. Although I don’t mind doing that, I don’t like to and cannot stand being given the cold shoulder when she’s upset at me.

“I do have germophobia, but nobody has germophobia towards their wives. Do you understand that?”

The mug was a ceramic white one.

Shen Rou had already seen the lipstick stain.

When she saw Mo Yesi drink from the mug, right where Qiao Mianmian left her lipstick stain, she felt as if someone had given her a tight slap to the face.

She could practically hear the slaps on her cheeks.

At that moment, she realized that everything she and Qiao Mianmian had said had been overheard by Mo Yesi.

He was using his actions to prove that he didn’t mind it the least bit.

Shen Rou’s biggest edge over Qiao Mianmian was the friendship with Mo Yesi of over 20 years.

In everyone’s eyes, they were childhood sweethearts, a perfect match for each other.

They were the most compatible pair possible.

Moreover, she was the only female friend allowed around Mo Yesi in all 20 years and more.

Mo Yesi had no other female friends.

Although he was never that close or intimate with her, Shen Rou had always been satisfied with the status quo.

No matter how he treated her, she was a notch above everyone else, just on the basis that she was Mo Yesi’s only female friend.

She felt that nobody else could ever understand Mo Yesi more than she did.

Meanwhile, what Mo Yesi had just said directly denied her of that “privilege.”

Whether he meant it from the bottom of his heart or was only saying it so Qiao Mianmian wouldn’t misunderstand, it didn’t make much of a difference to Shen Rou.

Both reasons were equally painful.

She felt as if her heart had just been stabbed and was bleeding profusely.

She knew Mo Yesi too well.

That was precisely why she felt so hurt.

He had really fallen for Qiao Mianmian.

He was being so protective of her and refused to let her be aggrieved or wronged in any way.

But did he know how much hurt it caused her to watch him defend that woman?
