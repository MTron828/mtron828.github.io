Chapter 1767: Perhaps She Was Suspecting Him Too

Qiao Mianmian sat in her seat and took out her eye mask. After adjusting her seat, she put it on and prepared to catch up on her sleep.

It took three and a half hours to fly from Yuncheng City to Ning City.

She put on her eye mask and was preparing to sleep when she heard footsteps beside her.

After a while, she felt some movements beside her.

Qiao Mianmian ignored it and continued sleeping.

After the person beside her sat down, there was no more movement.

A while after the plane took off, the stewardess came over to ask if she needed any help. Not completely asleep, Qiao Mianmian heard a familiar voice. “A glass of ice water. Put on more ice.”

“Alright, sir. Anything else?”

“Just a glass of ice water,” the man said coldly.

“Alright. Please wait for a moment, Mister. I’ll get it ready right away.”

Qiao Mianmian took off her blindfold.

She turned around and widened her eyes when she saw Gong Zeli sitting beside her.

Just as she turned around, Gong Zeli also turned to look at her.

He wasn’t surprised to see her.

Qiao Mianmian was stunned for a few seconds. She frowned and felt something strange.

“Mr. Gong, are you going to Ning City?”

“If not, where else would I be going?” Gong Zeli’s eyes were gentle and his voice was full of smiles.

Qiao Mianmian thought about the rumors and didn’t want to interact with Gong Zeli anymore.

After asking, she had no intention of continuing the conversation. She put on her eye mask and turned around to continue sleeping.

Her back was facing Gong Zeli.

Gong Zeli looked down at her back and slowly clenched his fists.

How could he not feel that Qiao Mianmian was deliberately avoiding him?

Gong Zeli could guess why she was acting like this.

It must be because of what happened last time.

Hence, she was trying to avoid suspicion.

She definitely didn’t want to have any scandals with him anymore.

To her, he was trouble, and she wanted to stay away from him.

He felt bitter, but he knew that his actions were a little abnormal.

He bumped into her every time.

Perhaps she was starting to suspect him, too.

After all, how could there be so many coincidences in the world?

He felt that he was really despicable.

He knew that she was someone he shouldn’t have, but he still wanted to see her.

Knowing that she was flying to another city to film a show today, he got someone to find out the exact time of her flight and bought tickets for the same flight. He even bought the seat beside her.

The result was that she despised him.

He felt that it was worth it to spend a few hours with her on the plane.

Gong Zeli found his actions funny.

It turned out that liking someone was really petty.

But what could he do?

He really liked her.

He liked her so much that he didn’t want to let go even though he knew it was impossible.

He liked her so much that he was willing to humble himself.

Qiao Mianmian looked like she was sleeping, but in fact, she wasn’t.
