Chapter 887: Do You Want to Come to My Birthday Party?

If she was a lucky star, she wouldn’t implicate others.

She hoped that she was a lucky star. In that case, she hoped that Tu Yilei’s hand would recover and not leave any scars.

“Oh right, it’s my birthday in a few days. Do you want to come to my birthday party?” Bai Yusheng knew that she was worried about Tu Yilei, so he changed the topic.

Qiao Mianmian looked up at him. “Brother Bai, you’re celebrating your birthday?”

“Mm, this weekend. The birthday party might be held at home, and some family and friends in Yuncheng City will be invited. I hope you can come to my birthday party too.”

“Alright.” Qiao Mianmian nodded immediately. “It’s Brother Bai’s birthday, I’ll definitely be there.”

“Then, it’s settled. You have to come. One more thing, I’ll invite some good friends in the industry too. You and Mo Yesi... you’d better not appear together. If you decide not to expose your relationship, for now, you can’t appear at my birthday party as a couple.

“Do you understand what I mean?”

Qiao Mianmian nodded. “Mm, I got it.”

She knew what Bai Yusheng meant.

Even then, she didn’t know how to tell Mo Yesi.

To appear at the same banquet but pretend not to know each other. Mo Yesi... would probably be unhappy.

He was such a proud man, but he had to hide because of her. He couldn’t publicly announce their marriage.

It was obvious how uncomfortable he felt.

But it wasn’t the right time to reveal their relationship.

She had signed a contract with Linda. The contract stated that she couldn’t reveal her relationship for two years.

“I think my parents will definitely like you when they see you.” Bai Yusheng smiled as he looked at the girl’s delicate and fair face.

Qiao Mianmian blinked. “Mm?”

“I’ve told them about you, so they hope to see you at my birthday party.”

“Brother Bai mentioned me to your parents?” Qiao Mianmian was a little shocked.

Bai Yusheng nodded. “When I called them, I mentioned it. I didn’t expect them to be so interested in you and want to meet you. Oh right, can I send them a picture of you first?

“I told them that you look a lot like my sister when she was younger, so they wanted to take a look.

“Of course. Brother Bai, if you want to post my photo, then do it.” Qiao Mianmian never thought that Bai Yusheng would mention her to his parents.

Moreover, his parents seemed to be very interested in her?

She really didn’t know how he talked about her.

Bai Yusheng smiled and said, “Alright, I’ll send it to them later. Let’s go to the hospital to check on Tu Yilei first.”

...

Renxin Hospital.

At the hospital, Qiao Mianmian and Bai Yusheng went to look for Tu Yilei.

The doctor was checking the wound on Tu Yilei’s hand.

Michael anxiously asked the doctor, “Doctor, how’s Little Tu’s injury? Can his hand recover? He’s a celebrity, his hand and face are equally important. You have to treat him well, you have to treat his hand.

“He can’t have a scarred hand. It’ll affect his future career development.”L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎
