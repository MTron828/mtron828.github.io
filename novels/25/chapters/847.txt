Chapter 848: Let’s Go, I Don’t Want to See Him Again

But his relationship with Qiao Mianmian was still different.

He won because of those 10 years.

This was something this man could never compare to.

And he knew Qiao Mianmian too.

She valued relationships.

Ten years of feelings would never be gone just like that.

She was proud and arrogant, but she was still angry about his betrayal, so she quickly found another man to take revenge on him.

If this was her revenge, then she had succeeded.

He was so jealous.

He should be the one being so intimate with her.

He had her, but because of his jerk, he lost her.

He regretted it now and wanted to redeem himself...

Would he... still have a chance?

Qiao Mianmian was at a loss for words.

She didn’t know where Su Ze got his confidence from.

He still thought that she liked him.

If Mo Yesi was inferior to him in every aspect, she could understand why he was so confident.

But the truth was that he was inferior to Mo Yesi in every aspect.

What made him think that she was with Mo Yesi to spite him?

Based on those 10 years of relationship?

That’s right, she was a sentimental person.

But for a man who betrayed her, she would be a masochist if she still cared about her feelings.

“Su Ze, are you delusional?” Qiao Mianmian knew very well that she had to show her attitude in front of Mo Yesi.

Su Ze was stunned. “Mianmian, you...”

“Firstly, I’ve already said that we’re strangers now. Please don’t address me so intimately. Secondly, I don’t know who gave you the confidence to think that I’m angry with you because I’m dating a new boyfriend. May I ask Mr. Su, how is my boyfriend inferior to you? He’s more handsome, gentler, more loving, and more doting than you in all aspects. Where did you get the confidence that I don’t really like him?”

When she said this, Mo Yesi looked down at her and his eyes flickered.

His arm around her waist tightened.

Qiao Mianmian looked up at him and smiled sweetly. “He’s a thousand times better than you. You actually think that I’m with him to spite you. What a joke.

“Mr. Su, haven’t you heard of this saying before?”

Ignoring Su Ze’s awful expression, Qiao Mianmian’s smile deepened. “People go for the high and the low. My boyfriend is better than you in every aspect. I’m with him because he has so many things that attract me.

“He’s so outstanding and he’s so good to me. It’s not like I have a problem with my brain. If I don’t like him, do I have to like a jerk who betrayed me? Ha, 10 years of feelings? I’ll just treat those 10 years of feelings as feeding a dog. To me, these aren’t important at all.

“I only know one thing: cherish the person in front of you.”

With that, Qiao Mianmian held Mo Yesi’s arm and said softly, “Let’s go, I don’t want to see him again.”

Mo Yesi was silent for a few seconds before nodding. “Alright.”

He would let Su Ze go for now.

He would teach him a lesson when he got back.
