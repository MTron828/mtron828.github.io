Chapter 892: Why Don’t We Add Each Other as Friends?

Qiao Mianmian felt that it was boring to just sit there.

Besides some work-related interactions, she couldn’t find anything else to talk about with Tu Yilei.

But Tu Yilei felt that even without doing anything, as long as she was by his side, he wouldn’t be bored at all.

He was filled with bliss as he looked at her.

But he couldn’t say it to her.

He could only bury his feelings deep in his heart and hide them carefully, afraid that she would see them.

“I usually stay at home to watch movies, play games or go out for some exercise. Other than that, I don’t do much. Do you find my life especially monotonous and boring?”

“You like to play games too?” Qiao Mianmian finally heard a similar hobby. She couldn’t help but ask, “What game do you like to play?”

“Some mobile games to pass the time. For example, King of Medicine.”

“You like playing King of Medicine? I play this game too. What’s your rank?”

Tu Yilei thought for a while. “Last season, I think it was 58 stars. This season, I entered the ranks of the Kings. I’ve been rather busy with work recently, so I haven’t played much. You play this game too. Which zone are you in? What rank are you in?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“Y-You’re a King level 58? Did you hit it yourself? Didn’t you find a substitute?”Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

She couldn’t believe it.

Tu Yilei was a top-notch actor who was busy with work every day. It was bad enough that he had the time to play games, but he actually managed to get 58 stars?

He couldn’t have done it himself.

This didn’t make sense.

“A substitute player?” Tu Yilei furrowed his brows and looked confused. “Why do we need a substitute player? If we get a substitute player, wouldn’t there be no fun in playing games?”

“So, you did it yourself?!”

“Yes, why?”

“...”

“Oh right, your rank...”

Qiao Mianmian covered her face. “I just got on the Diamond.”

“Diamond? Pretty good.”

Qiao Mianmian asked, “How is it good?!”

“As a girl, you’re already very good at getting at the Diamond rank on your own.”

“...”

Was he serious?

“Miss Qiao, why don’t we add each other as friends in the game?” Tu Yilei still didn’t have Qiao Mianmian’s contact details. When he found out that she was also playing the game, he quietly suggested adding her as a friend.

Not only did he have a contact number, but he could also get Qiao Mianmian to play with him.

“If that’s the case, we can play games together when we’re free. If you don’t mind, I can bring you along.”

Qiao Mianmian was tempted.

With Tu Yilei, a King level expert with a strength of 58 stars, leading her, why would she worry about not being able to become a King level expert?

This was too tempting for a Diamond rookie like her.

But...

As she thought about it, she hesitated again. “Erm, I think we should forget it. I don’t usually play games, and I’ve barely played in the past few seasons. If you want to find a teammate to play with, you should find someone who plays regularly.”

“It’s alright. Actually, I don’t play much. If we have the time, we can play a few rounds together. If not, forget it.”

“... Alright, then.”

Since Tu Yilei had already put it this way, Qiao Mianmian couldn’t reject him and only nodded in agreement.
