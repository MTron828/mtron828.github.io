Chapter 912: She Accidentally Slept With Her Prince Charming

Jiang Luoli’s nervousness increased to seven. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

She clenched her fists even tighter.

Her heart raced as she gripped the cushion on the sofa tightly. She dared not look at the man in front of her.

Before coming, she was aggressive.

But when she saw Mo Shixiu, she was terrified.

Mo Shixiu looked down at her for a few seconds and saw that she was nervous. He then slowly sat down opposite her and said gently, “Miss Jiang, you don’t have to be afraid. It’s just a normal meeting between friends. Relax.”

As he spoke, his lips curled up. In order to make her relax, he joked. “I think I’m not that scary-looking. Why doesn’t Miss Jiang dare to look up at me? Could it be that I’m not good enough for Miss Jiang?”

“Who says I don’t dare!”

Jiang Luoli couldn’t tolerate being provoked. She immediately looked up and glared at Mo Shixiu.

When her gaze landed on the man’s handsome face, her heart suddenly slowed down, and her mind went blank for a second. Then, her heart started pounding even faster.

It was beating so fast... she felt as if a drum was pounding in her chest.

His entire chest was shaking.

Gosh, she couldn’t take it anymore.

How could Mo Shixiu be more attractive than on television?

She had always felt that his looks on television were shocking enough.

As a pervert, she felt like her life had been turned upside down.

She accidentally slept with her Prince Charming.

This was the first time she’d given a man so handsome, with such a good figure, and such an outstanding one at that. She’d made a killing.

God knew how many times she had fantasized about Mo Shixiu.

She even dreamed of him...

Although the experience that night wasn’t very good, as long as it was Mo Shixiu, nothing else mattered.

She suddenly felt that the experience was especially good.

All her unhappiness towards this man vanished.

Who was Mo Shixiu?

He was the man that all the women in Country A wanted.

She actually managed to sleep with such a man.

What kind of luck did she have?

She now believed that Mo Shixiu had indeed been drugged that night.

Otherwise, given his status, she should never have been able to touch him in her life.

Not to mention sleeping with him.

So, she really earned it that night.

This surprise was as good as winning the lottery. No, it was even more surprising than winning the lottery.

Jiang Luoli was usually bold, but in front of Mo Shixiu, she was as timid as a lamb. She only looked up at him for a few seconds before lowering her head again.

She dared not look at him again.

If they continued to look at each other, she was afraid that she would die of a heart attack.

She took a sip of the coffee on the table to hide her nervousness and agitation.

“Miss Jiang, about that night...” Mo Shixiu had no experience with women. He didn’t have anorexia like his younger brother, but because of his personal relationship, he rarely interacted with women.

Their relationship history was the same.

The only difference was that Mo Yesi had Qiao Mianmian now.

Mo Shixiu was still single.
