Chapter 1161: Found Something That Unexpected Him

“Are you relieved now?”

Qiao Mianmian still looked nervous. She glanced at him. “Are you really not angry?”

“I’m really not.”

Mo Yesi rubbed her head and said gently, “Am I such a petty person in your eyes? If I’m not angry, then I’m really not angry.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She wanted to say that he was indeed petty!

He was a jealous man.

He was even jealous of Jiang Luoli. How could she not worry that he would be angry?

Su Ze was her ex-fiancé!

...

Mo Yesi was busy most of the time.

During work, he was busy from morning to night.

Qiao Mianmian went to the Mo Corporation to accompany him a few times before realizing that, although he was the boss, his job wasn’t easy at all.

He was even busier than the employees below.

Once the work mode was activated, it would spin around like a spinning top.

She didn’t know that Mo Yesi had reduced his workload after marrying her.

He had seldom worked overtime again, and he would take time off from work.

Before they got married, he worked overtime almost every day.

He also spent his weekends at work.

After returning to the company, one of them focused on work while the other did his own things. Neither of them disturbed the other. Occasionally, they would exchange glances.

Qiao Mianmian was used to such interactions.

She also liked the way they interacted.

While Mo Yesi was working, she did not stay idle either. She also took out the script to read.

Speaking of which, this drama had just started filming not long ago, but it had experienced many twists and turns.

First, it was the female lead. Now, it was the male lead.

After filming for a while, they had to reshoot all the scenes.

He wondered who Bai Yusheng’s new male lead would be.

In the blink of an eye, it was almost time for Mo Yesi to get off work. Mo Yesi had also ended his work early and was discussing with Qiao Mianmian about where to go for dinner.

They had just finished discussing. Mo Yesi turned off his computer and was about to leave when he received a call.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t know who was calling him.

But Mo Yesi’s expression changed when he received the call.

After a while, he ended the call. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

He turned around and looked at Qiao Mianmian strangely.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but ask, “What’s wrong? Who called you?”

Mo Yesi looked at her silently for a few seconds before saying, “An employee said something about work.”

Qiao Mianmian felt like Mo Yesi was lying to her.

That call was definitely not about work.

But she did not ask further.

“Baby, why don’t we go back for dinner tonight? Call Chen Chen along. Grandma likes him a lot. We just left that day, and she sent me a message asking me to bring him back more often.”

Mo Yesi thought about the call just now, and a strange look flashed across his eyes.

Initially, he wanted to investigate the matter clearly so that Old Madam wouldn’t let her imagination run wild again.

He didn’t expect to find something that surprised him.

Although he wasn’t 100% sure yet, according to the information he had gathered so far, there was at least a 60% chance.

Hence, he had to bring Qiao Chen back and verify it.

This was no small matter.

Qiao Mianmian was a little surprised. “Go back for dinner? Why so suddenly? Did Grandma ask you to go back?”
