Chapter 1272: Don’t Think About Anything You Shouldn’t

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

That was why he was so cold to her.

That must be it.

Otherwise, how could he know that she was lying to him after 10 years?

Could it be that the girl took the initiative to find him and told him the truth?

She might be a beautiful girl.

If she was just a plain-looking woman, Gong Zeli wouldn’t have done this.

Shen Rou was filled with jealousy and anger.

Who was that slut!

Gong Zeli frowned. “This has nothing to do with you.”

Shen Rou’s expression changed. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He really found the girl.

“Zeli, who is she?”

Shen Rou suddenly had a feeling that this girl might be someone she knew.

“This has nothing to do with you.” Gong Zeli’s voice suddenly turned cold. Even from a distance, Shen Rou could feel it. “Shen Rou, I’m warning you for the last time. Don’t think of anything you shouldn’t.

“Otherwise, I won’t show you mercy.”

With that, Gong Zeli strode into the room.

“Miss Shen, let me send you out.” The subordinate witnessed everything and couldn’t help but sigh when he saw Shen Rou’s pale face and swollen eyes.

In the past, Young Master treated Miss Shen so well. He was gentle and considerate, obedient and attentive.

He doted on Miss Shen the most.

Now.

No one would be able to accept such a huge difference.

But who could she blame?

Young Master hated it when people lied to him.

Moreover, Miss Shen lied to the Young Master for 10 whole years.

Young Master was already kind enough to meet her.

Shen Rou’s eyes were red as she watched Gong Zeli leave.

She stood rooted to the ground.

“Miss Shen?” The subordinate frowned.

“Have you seen that woman?” Shen Rou suddenly turned around and asked coldly.

The bodyguard was stunned. “Miss Shen, what do you mean...”

“Didn’t he find the girl who really saved him that night? Have you seen her?” Shen Rou’s eyes were filled with hatred. “Tell me, what did that girl look like? How old is she? Is she very beautiful?

“Does your Young Master like her a lot?

“Do you know her name?”

The subordinate finally understood what she was asking about.

He looked at Shen Rou’s scary expression and frowned. “Miss Shen, you’re asking the wrong person. I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

The subordinate didn’t know who the girl was.

Even if he knew, he wouldn’t tell Shen Rou.

If the Young Master didn’t say it, would he dare to?

And looking at Shen Rou’s expression, if she knew who it was, she might do something.

“Miss Shen, I’ll send you off.” The subordinate made an inviting gesture. His tone was still polite, but it was a little domineering. “Miss Shen, please.”

...

Shen Rou had just left Gong Zeli’s house when she received a call from Madam Shen.

She picked it up and heard Madam Shen crying. “Rourou, have you got the money? The company’s share price is still falling. Your dad is worried sick. The Shen Corporation is being targeted this time. Someone is maliciously messing with the Shen Corporation’s stock in the market. The share price is falling more and more.”
