Chapter 2517: Do You Think You Can Fight Me?

Shen Rou actually wanted to sue Gong Zeli for slandering her.

Initially, many people were still waiting to see what would happen. But after seeing Shen Rou’s latest post, more and more people started to side with her.

If Gong Zeli hadn’t made up a lie to frame her, where would she get the guts to sue him?

If what she said was true and Gong Zeli really did this to protect Qiao Mianmian, he was too inhuman.

He was completely bewitched by her beauty.

In an instant, Shen Rou’s image as a “victim” was deeply rooted in the hearts of the netizens, and she became the target of compassion and sympathy. The netizens gathered on her Weibo to defend her, scold Qiao Mianmian and Gong Zeli for her, cheer her on, and encourage her to live a good life.

As for Qiao Mianmian and Gong Zeli, their image was negative.

Their Weibo comment section was filled with insults. When she opened the comment section, she saw that it was filled with all sorts of vulgarities.

Scum and slut.

If it was in ancient times, the two of them would probably be surrounded by people.

Gong Zeli’s Weibo comment section wasn’t closed.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t close it.

The two of them were scolded by hundreds of thousands of comments.

The netizens were clamoring for the two of them to be beaten up together. They even said that they had to publicly apologize to Shen Rou. Otherwise, the netizens wouldn’t let this adulterous couple off.

…

At the Shen Corporation.

Shen Rou was sitting at her desk with a happy smile on her face as she stared at the computer screen.

The screen showed the Weibo page.

The trending topics were all denouncing Qiao Mianmian and Gong Zeli.

Shen Rou smiled in satisfaction and tapped her long red nails on the computer screen. When her fingers touched Qiao Mianmian’s name, she paused and sneered. “Qiao Mianmian, you want to fight with me, are you even qualified?

“Do you think you can beat me?

“Even if Mo Yesi and Gong Zeli protect you, so what? You’re still under my control. I want to see how you’re going to make a comeback in this battle. Qiao Mianmian, you deserve it. Who asked you to go against me and make me unhappy?

“If I’m unhappy, don’t even think about being happy!” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“And you!” Her red nails moved slowly, and when they landed on Gong Zeli’s name, her expression was a little complicated. It was filled with hatred, resentment, and a little hurt. “Gong Zeli, you asked for this! I never thought of doing this to you. You’re the one who forced our relationship to the end! Since you have to go against me for this slut, I won’t let you have it easy!

“Since it’s something I, Shen Rou, can’t get, then I’ll destroy it!”

If she couldn’t get it, she couldn’t let others have it!

“You deserve it, you deserve it!” Scenes of the past surfaced in her mind. When she recalled the past, a few seconds of nostalgia appeared in her eyes, but soon, it turned into deep hatred.

They used to be so close.

Their relationship couldn’t be changed by outsiders.

She thought that they would always be good.

But she didn’t expect the balance to be broken because of a slut.

If it wasn’t for Qiao Mianmian, their relationship wouldn’t have turned out like this.
