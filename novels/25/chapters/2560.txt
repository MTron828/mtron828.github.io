Chapter 2562: Untitled

Qiao Mianmian nodded. “If I can.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

As long as it was nothing bad.

And she knew that Mo Yesi wouldn’t deliberately make things difficult for her.

“Alright, then give me a child.” The man rubbed her cheek gently with his warm palm. “Mianmian, give me a child. Our child.

“I think I’ll feel safer with a child.

“I want a child that belongs to us. Is that alright?”

He had made this request many times.

Qiao Mianmian slowly accepted it.

She loved Mo Yesi.

She wanted to be with him for the rest of her life.

Hence, she wanted to bear him a child.

A child that belonged to them, the fruit of their love.

Previously, she didn’t want to get married and have children too early. She wanted to fight for her career.

After all, she was still young.

It wouldn’t be too late to get pregnant a few years later.

But now…

This man was too good to her.

He really wanted her to give birth to their child.

Qiao Mianmian’s firm thoughts started to waver. She thought that it wasn’t a bad thing to have a baby early. Since he liked it so much, she should have a baby for him.

He’d done so much for her.

She should do something to make him happy.

“Mo Yesi, have you thought it through?” Qiao Mianmian looked into his deep and dark eyes and paused for a while. She then asked seriously, “You really want me to get pregnant? Are you really prepared to be a father?

“Do you know what will happen to our lives when the baby is born? It won’t just be one more person. Once the baby is born, it’ll be our responsibility.

“For the next 20 years, until he comes of age, we have to be responsible for him and take good care of him.”

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t old, but she was a girl, after all. She had more considerations.

She knew that there was no shortage of people to take care of the baby.

Madam Bai had already said that she would personally take care of her grandchild.

The Mo family didn’t lack people.

After Jiang Luoli got pregnant, Old Madam had already chosen a professional parenting team. In the future, when Jiang Luoli gave birth, the parenting team would help her raise the child.

It was easier for them to take care of their children.

He didn’t have to do everything himself.

But no matter how relaxed it was, that was their child. He would definitely be worried.

With a child in their world, their lives would definitely change.

If one party wasn’t prepared, conflict would inevitably arise in the future.

Qiao Mianmian felt that she had to make things clear first.

She was serious.

Mo Yesi listened seriously.

When she was done, the man smiled. “Baby, I’ve thought about everything you said. I’ve thought about everything you can think of.

“Do you think I said I wanted a child on a whim?”
