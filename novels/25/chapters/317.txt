Chapter 318: That Woman’s a Vixen

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Why were the Qiao family members all so shameless?

All of them were trying so hard to marry into rich families.

Had they gone insane from being poor for too long?

The Mo and Shen families were amongst the richest and most powerful families in Yuncheng City. Were they trying to fish for both at once?

When Mo Yesi met Qiao Mianmian, she’d still been overseas and hadn’t made it back in time to stop it from developing.

But now that she’d seen it for herself, she couldn’t possibly let the Qiao family continue to have their way.

Shen Xin had been brought up in a greenhouse all her life. She’d never been presented to harsh conditions and thus saw the world as a beautiful place filled with kind people.

Her mindset was too naive, and that made her an easy target for others.

Qiao Mianmian managed to get Mo Yesi to marry her, that was how scheming she was! How much better could her brother be?

Her sister’s words completely shook shen Xin.

It sounded like her sister knew the Qiao family.

And that there was a conflict between her and them?

What exactly was going on?

“Miss Shen, what do you mean by that? That our Qiao family members are shameless?” Qiao Chen was angered by Shen Rou and didn’t watch his manners anymore.

Shen Rou looked at him with disdain. “I meant exactly what I said, simple as that. Qiao Chen, I’m warning you, you’d better stay away from Xiao Xin in the future. The Shen family daughters are out of your reach. Xiao Xin is too innocent to think about anything, but I know what you’re plotting.

“Don’t you dare think that you can fool her with that pretty face of yours, get into the Shen family, and easily climb the social ladder.

“Dream on! Xiao Xin already has a fiancé. Her future husband will only be that rich man who comes from a family of equal standing to ours, not a poor boy like you.” Shen Rou felt a wave of hatred surge inside her as she looked at Qiao Chen’s pale but handsome face.

Qiao Mianmian had entranced Mo Yesi with that face of hers too.

Now her brother was trying to do the same.

This sibling duo was utterly shameless!

Using their looks to fool others was a low and outdated approach. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Sis, it’s not what you think...” Shen Xin looked flustered as she turned to Qiao Chen and tried to explain things to her sister. “Qiao Chen isn’t fooling me. I’m the one who’s taking the initiative to pursue him. You’ve misunderstood him.”

Shen Xin couldn’t believe that her sister, the one person who emphasized image, respect, and civility so greatly, could utter such curt and irrational words.

She couldn’t even start to imagine how angry Qiao Chen felt to hear those.

“Even if you’re the one taking the initiative, it must be him who led you along.” Shen Rou thought about Qiao Mianmian each time she looked at Qiao Chen.

She recalled every single word Mo Yesi said to her that day.

He was willing to give up the 20 years of friendship and ties just for Qiao Mianmian alone.

That woman was a vixen.

Entrancing him so wholly.

He had no one else but Qiao Mianmian in his heart anymore.

But before Qiao Mianmian’s appearance, she had been the only woman by his side. That special, exclusive treatment was rightfully hers.

But now, everything had changed.

The man she’d loved for 20 years was being taken away by a woman inferior to her in every way.

How could she take it lying down?

Shen Rou vented all her frustrations at Qiao Mianmian on Qiao Chen. Her words got harsher as she lost rationality with each passing moment. “You’re so young but so very scheming already. The Qiao family upbringing must have been about using your comparative advantage to gain interests and power for yourselves, huh?”
