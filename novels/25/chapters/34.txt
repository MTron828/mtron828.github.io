Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

She could hear his deep, sexy voice in her ears. “Don’t feel uneasy. You are Mo Yesi’s wife. You deserve this respect. You will soon realize that your status as Mrs. Mo will bring you many more good things.

“Soon, you will get used to being treated like this.”

He inched closer to her.

So close that when he spoke, Qiao Mianmian could feel his soft and warm lips rubbing against her earlobe. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

All she could smell was him, his rousing hormones.

She wondered what perfume he was using.

It was unexpectedly pleasant.

As she breathed in his smell and listened to his deep, arousing voice, Qiao Mianmian’s heart palpitated. She could feel her chest trembling.

This distance... was too intimate.

Apart from Su Ze, she had never been so intimate with any other man before.

“Mo Yesi...”

She turned her head around, intending to tell him to move away. As she turned around, his lips landed on her cheek.

Both of them blanked out in shock.

Qiao Mianmian looked at him startled. A few seconds later, her face turned pink with embarrassment.

She bit her lip as her eyes flickered and her earlobes reddened.

Mo Yesi was also shocked.

However, after he saw her red cheeks, a dark fire flashed across his eyes.

By the side.

The restaurant manager’s mouth was agape, shocked by what he had seen.

Oh my goodness.

Words were that Young Master Mo had purged himself of desires and was not attracted to women.

No matter how pretty or sexy the woman, he would not give her another look, nor show any interest.

Rumors were that there was once a hot female star who wanted to hook up with him. She managed to sneak into his hotel room.

Stripped naked and hidden under the sheets.

It was a popular star with a hot body.

However, she failed and was thrown out of the room by Mo Yesi’s bodyguards.

After that, she was banned from the industry.

From then on, many women who wanted to hook up with him no longer dared to do so.

From the incident, everyone learned that Young Master Mo could only be observed from afar and was unapproachable.

No matter how much they lusted for him, they did not dare to go close to him.

However...

If he had seen right, the one who initiated it was Young Master Mo.

Mrs. Mo was instead the one who was shyer and trying to avoid him.

He flirted with her so much her face went red.

Seems like Young Master Mo liked this sort of innocent student.

No wonder those sexy stars failed.

Qiao Mianmian was still blushing when they sat down.

Her heart beat faster whenever she recalled that unintentional “kiss”.

Mo Yesi had his eyes on her. His eyes burned with passion and lust when looking at her.

Qiao Mianmian did not even dare to look back.

But even without her looking, she could feel his gaze on her.

She felt inexplicably nervous.

It was not like this when she was with Su Ze.

But Mo Yesi...

The moment she saw this man, she got uneasy and anxious.
