Chapter 538: You Terrible Friend!

He must have been really bothered by what happened that morning.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t have done something so childish while she was asleep.

It seemed like men really bothered about how long they could last at it.

Thankfully, the last two times were proof that Mo Yesi was indeed normal.

“Luo Luo, I didn’t send you this.” She wanted to make it clear that she didn’t say something so shameful.

“Not you?” Jiang Luoli was stunned. “But...”

A few seconds later, her eyes widened in disbelief and understanding. “Are you saying, it was Prince Charming...”

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian nodded. “It was him.”

Jiang Luoli was speechless.

“In that case, he saw what I sent you too?”

“I guess.”

“Damn!” Jiang Luoli almost jumped. “Oh no, oh no... I’m doomed. Prince Charming would surely have thought of strangling me when he saw it. Baby, do you think he’s angry? What should I do?”

After all, which man would be alright with others commenting on their duration?

Especially a man as outstanding as Prince Charming. He would likely be more bothered than others.

Qiao Mianmian looked at how helpless she seemed and shook her head. “I don’t know, either. But I don’t think he’s angry at you.”

“He isn’t?” Jiang Luoli grabbed her arm. “So, Prince Charming will still be nice to me in the future on your account... right? He won’t hold grudges, will he?”

“... I guess he’ll be fine.”

“Baby, you’ve got to help me. You can’t let Prince Charming have a bad impression of me.”

Qiao Mianmian asked, “Me? How do I help you?”

Jiang Luoli looked at her seriously. “In the future, you can exercise with Prince Charming several times a day to build his confidence. This way, he won’t mind what I said so much.”

Qiao Mianmian sulked. “... You terrible friend!”

...

Jiang Luoli still had classes in the afternoon, so Qiao Mianmian stayed in school until she went for her afternoon classes.

Before she got into the cab, Qiao Mianmian texted Mo Yesi: [I’ve applied for leave. I’ll look for you at the office now.]

Mo Yesi replied immediately: [Wait there, I’ll get Uncle Li to fetch you.]

Qiao Mianmian gave the cab driver the address and then replied: [No need, I’m already in a cab. It’s less than 20 minutes to get to your place, it’s alright.]

Mo Yesi didn’t insist. [Alright, I’ll get Wei Zheng to wait for you in the lobby, then. I’m rather busy in the afternoon. I’ve got two meetings, so I won’t be able to accompany you. You can rest in my office while waiting.]

Qiao Mianmian responded: [Mm, I got it.]

Mo Yesi: [Do you crave anything? I can get someone to prepare it. Fruits? Cake? Ice-cream? There aren’t any snacks in the office pantry right now.]

These were just common day-to-day talk.

But Qiao Mianmian felt especially warm and fuzzy.

It was probably the kind of sweetness that came from realizing that the other party was so thoughtful even about the little things.

That was how one could tell how important they were to the other person.

It was always in the little things.

The smaller the matter, the more acute the feeling.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

She smiled and thought for a while before sending him a voice message: [You don’t have to get it prepared for me. I’ll go to the bakery to get a cake later. I know of one with really good cakes. Do you want some? I’ll get it for you too.]
