Chapter 1495: I Came to Pick You Up, Aren’t You Happy?

Qiao Anxin still stood there.

She looked at Qiao Mianmian and felt even more humiliated.

Thankfully, Boss Huang had been thinking about her for a few years and had just gotten his hands on her.

Hence, even if Qiao Anxin didn’t take the initiative to greet him, he didn’t seem to mind.

He walked towards Qiao Anxin and pulled her into his arms.

“My little sweetheart, why do you look so unhappy? I came especially to pick you up, aren’t you happy?”

Qi Anxin stiffened.

She instinctively wanted to push him away.

But Boss Huang grabbed her waist and kissed her on the forehead.

“Mm...”

Qi Anxin blushed and resisted.

Sensing her struggle, Boss Huang frowned and was a little unhappy.

He had always been thinking about Qiao Anxin.

But that was because he never got it, so he kept thinking about it for so long.

Now that she was already his, she naturally wouldn’t be as rare as before.

Boss Huang’s expression darkened because of her struggle.

Qiao Anxin pushed him away and wiped her lips with the back of her hand. Seeing that Boss Huang’s expression darkened, she panicked. She hurriedly explained, “Chairman Huang, of course I’m very happy that you’re here to pick me up. But aren’t you busy? Why are you here?” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

As she spoke, she took the bouquet from him and pretended to be happy. “These flowers are so beautiful. I like them. Did you buy them for me?”

Boss Huang’s expression softened.

Just as he was about to say something, he caught sight of Qiao Mianmian and his eyes lit up.

He widened his eyes and he sized Qiao Mianmian up again.

He seemed to have lost his soul as he stared at her.

Boss Huang had a management company under him, and there were many beautiful female artistes in the company.

He had played all sorts of games, so he naturally didn’t lack beauties.

He’d just gotten Qiao Anxin a few days ago and felt a sense of achievement. But the moment he saw Qiao Mianmian, Boss Huang’s soul almost left his body. He couldn’t move his body or even his eyes.

He even forgot about Qiao Anxin.

Boss Huang had many female artistes, but this was the first time he saw someone as beautiful as Qiao Mianmian.

His gaze was too direct. Qiao Mianmian looked up and saw a pair of ugly eyes full of desire.

Boss Huang looked at her as if he had lost his soul. He didn’t hide his desire.

Qiao Mianmian frowned.

She had already guessed who this man was.

Nana had said before that the boss of Qiao Anxin’s new agency wasn’t a good person.

He had slept with every female artiste in the company.

Qiao Mianmian thought that Qiao Anxin would never accept such a thing.

But Qiao Anxin was obviously...

Looking at this perverted old man who was even older than Qiao Ruhai, Qiao Mianmian didn’t know how Qiao Anxin could do it.

She was too harsh on herself.
