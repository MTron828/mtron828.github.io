Chapter 2208: What Can They Use to Fight With Her?

“That’s why Young Lady Shen is Young Lady Shen. She’s never short of suitors, and they’re all eligible.”

“That’s right. After all, the Shen family has already survived the crisis. There are still many people willing to marry her. Speaking of which, Shen Rou’s conditions are still very good. As long as the Shen family doesn’t have any problems, she’ll still be the Young Lady of the Shen family that many men pursue. So, don’t mock her. No matter what, her life won’t be bad. Even if she can’t marry Mo Yesi, the man she marries in the future will definitely be good.”

“That’s true. She can’t marry Mo Yesi, but she can’t possibly marry someone with poor qualifications. I can only say that she definitely can’t find a man with better qualifications than Mo Yesi. But it’s not a problem to find someone with good qualifications.”

“That jewelry set is really nice. Aren’t you going to bid for it?”

“The starting price is 10 million yuan. I’m sure it’ll reach 30 million. Forget it, let’s just watch the fun. It’s too extravagant for me to spend tens of millions on a jewelry set. After all, we don’t have such good lives. There aren’t any men willing to buy it for us.”

“Say, if Qiao Mianmian also likes this jewelry set, won’t the situation be especially interesting later?”

“Qiao Mianmian? If she likes it too, then Shen Rou definitely won’t have a share. The sum of her and that man’s entire wealth can’t compare to Mo Yesi’s wealth. Moreover, Qiao Mianmian has the Bai family behind her. What can they use to fight with her?”

“Now that you mention it, I suddenly want to see Qiao Mianmian bid for that jewelry set, too.”

In the front row.

After the man beside Shen Rou placed a bid, another elegant woman quickly joined in.

“11 million yuan. Madam Rong has offered 11 million yuan. Is anyone willing to bid higher?”

“12 million.” The man beside Shen Rou raised the bidding sign without hesitation.

Madam Rong didn’t back down and immediately placed a higher bid. “15 million.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

She raised three million in one go.

Someone exclaimed, “15 million. Madam Rong has bid 15 million. Is there anyone who wants to bid higher?”

The man beside Shen Rou frowned, but he quickly raised his bid again. “18 million.”

“18 million! Mr. Chen has already bid 18 million! Is there a higher bid?” the person on stage said excitedly.

Madam Rong frowned.

She really liked that jewelry set. Before coming to the banquet, she was filled with confidence.

But this price made her hesitate.

If this continued, this jewelry set would exceed 20 million yuan.

Even if it was Queen Eleena’s favorite set, and it had an extraordinary meaning and was worth collecting, if she had to spend more than 20 million, she had to consider if it was worth it.

Madam Rong hesitated for a while before looking up at the dazzling jewelry on the display stand.

She still liked it. She would do it one last time.

She hesitated for a moment before raising her bid again. “20 million.”
