Chapter 1527: I Won’t Let You Off If You Bully Her Again

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

She liked Li Bai even more.

It wasn’t easy for a Li Bai on the domestic server to be willing to help her up her rankings. But because she wanted to appease a particular jealous lover, she reluctantly deleted him from her friend list.

Actually, she didn’t want to delete him at all.

That boy was really cute.

He called her sister so sweetly.

“If you want to play in the future, look for me.” Mo Yesi knew that he couldn’t go overboard. He had to stop while he was ahead. He reached out and patted Qiao Mianmian’s head. “I can play with you after work. I can also have free time at work.”

Although he didn’t like playing games.

But, in order to prevent his wife from finding another “Little Brother”, he didn’t mind playing with her.

He didn’t want his wife to call another man Little Brother in the game.

How could a 16-year-old underage be innocent?

Children nowadays matured early and understood everything at 16 years old. They couldn’t take it seriously.

“Look for you?” Qiao Mianmian blinked and looked at him suspiciously. “Do you know how to play this game?”

She had never seen Mo Yesi play games before.

What was his hobby?

It seemed like other than work, he would train and accompany her.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t think of anything else.

Mo Yesi was agitated by her suspicious look. The man kept quiet for a few seconds and then reached out to her.

Qiao Mianmian blinked, not knowing what he wanted.

Mo Yesi looked at the cell phone in her hand. “Give it to me.”

“Oh.”

Qiao Mianmian handed it to him obediently.

Mo Yesi opened the game and used Qiao Mianmian’s account.

Then, Qiao Mianmian watched in shock as he took down an Assassin and defeated his teammates.

The other party was beaten up badly.

Qiao Mianmian felt like she was about to cry.

Mo Yesi’s hero was Li Bai.

The two vulnerable Mages and Archers were scolded by him.

Angela: [Li Bai, do I have a feud with you? Why are you targeting me? Are you crazy?]

Luban: [Li Bai, Angela is my wife. If you bully her again, I won’t let you off.]

Qiao Mianmian saw Mo Yesi smile as he replied to the couple: [Couple? Then, I’ll let you die together.]

Ten minutes later.

Angela and Luban died together.

Or maybe Luban died a second ago, and a few seconds later, so did Angela.

The two weaklings were hiding under the defense tower and trembling.

What was worse was that Mo Yesi still wanted to kill her.

The two of them were furious and kept scolding him.

Angela: [Li Bai, are you a pervert?] Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Luban: [You must be single, jealous of our love. What’s the point of playing this game? You don’t even have a wife. Hahaha, single dogs are so pitiful. They can only find their presence in the game.]

Then, the number of deaths increased.

In the end, the death count was 2-25.

Mo Yesi got the MVP, God Seal, Four Kill, and more than 40% damage.

His teammates all liked him. Some even felt that he was playing well and wanted to pull him along.

Mo Yesi rejected it and exited the game. He then handed the cell phone to Qiao Mianmian, who was still in shock.

“How is it? Your husband shouldn’t be any worse than that little brother. Do you think I can bring you up now?”
