Those dark eyes looking straight at her, they began to glow bit by bit.

He smiled. “Baby, did you have a good sleep?”

Qiao Mianmian looked a little lost.

And a little... stumped.

The desire in his eyes felt so familiar, she couldn’t conceal her shock.

Why did he...

Mo Yesi did not wait for her answer. He chuckled and tipped her chin up. “You fell asleep so early last night, you must’ve had a good sleep. It’s still rather early, we can do some healthy exercises before getting out of bed.”

“H-Healthy exercises?”

“Mm.” Mo Yesi’s eyes shifted to her fair neck and glowed even more now. His voice was now hoarser than before. “I had some urgent matters to attend to last night, and it got in the way. We can now continue what we didn’t manage to finish up.”

Since he’d decided that he wasn’t going to let her go regardless of her choice to forgive him, then there wasn’t much to consider.

It was a matter of time she became his woman.

She could only be his woman.

Qiao Mianmian widened her eyes. “W-What did you say?”

Didn’t he despise her for being dirty?

Why did he... FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Baby, I want you.” Mo Yesi’s voice got deeper as a warm, passionate kiss landed on her lips. He explored the vicinity of her lips with his lips, while his hand did the tour under her pajamas.

His warm hand making its way on her body... Qiao Mianmian felt like his hand was a ball of fire igniting her.

Her body was warming up too.

The man’s lips brushed past hers and ventured lower.

“Baby...”

He murmured hoarsely.

Mianmian was getting a bit dizzy from all the kissing, and her acts of resistance slowed down.

“Mo Yesi...” She bit her lip as a pink blush powdered her cheeks.

That gentle voice excited him further.

The next moment, he ripped her pajamas apart.

The sudden coolness on her chest seemed to send a warning signal to Qiao Mianmian to snap out of her grogginess.

When she opened her eyes and saw the man’s expression, her heart dropped.

She was frightened.

It was as if she saw a starving beast.

And she was the prey that the beast laid his eyes on.

It seemed like he could pounce on her and devour her in the next second.

“Baby, I want you.” Mo Yesi was ready.

“N-No!”

Qiao Mianmian’s expression changed as she reached her arms out to stop him from getting closer.

The man furrowed his brows. “Why not? You aren’t willing?”

“N-Not that!”

Qiao Mianmian’s face was all red. “Not now, not yet. Mo Yesi, let go of me, I’m getting out of bed.”

With that, she pushed him away.

This time, Mo Yesi almost fell off the bed as he was caught completely off-guard.

Qiao Mianmian quickly wrapped the blanket around her and hopped off the bed.

Before Mo Yesi had fully reacted to what was going on, she was already dashing to the washroom with the blanket around her.
