Chapter 2436: Am I Very Important to You?

Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

How insecure was this man to think that she was sick of him?

He was Mo Yesi.

Did he know how many women thought of him as an unreachable Prince Charming?

As long as he was willing, even if it was just a one-night stand, countless women would queue up to have a good time with him.

This wasn’t because Qiao Mianmian was a midwife selling melons, nor was it because she felt that her husband’s charm was invincible.

Mo Yesi’s popularity was just that good.

Every time he posted on Weibo, the comment section would be filled with comments like “Hubby, *** me”. There were also comments like “Hubby, I’m lying down”, “Hubby, lie down, let me do it”. It was simply unbearable to watch.

Every time Qiao Mianmian looked at his comment section, she felt like she’d entered a wolf’s den.

Not to mention the netizens, she also knew that many socialites and heiresses were interested in him.

Shen Rou was one of them.

He was a god to others.

Many women’s greatest desire was to be looked at by him.

But this man was so lacking in confidence in front of her.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t expect this.

She never expected Mo Yesi to be worried that she’d get sick of him.

“Mo Yesi.” A little shocked, Qiao Mianmian bit her lip. She looked at the man’s handsome and deep facial features and asked in disbelief, “You want to know if my feelings for you are the same as my feelings for the food I like?”

Mo Yesi kept quiet for a few seconds before replying, “Yes.”

He even wondered if Qiao Mianmian was being lukewarm towards him now because she no longer felt fresh towards him.

They’d been together for so long.

“How could that be?” Qiao Mianmian unbuckled her seatbelt and threw herself into his arms. “Mo Yesi, I won’t allow you to compare yourself to food. You’re not food, you’re a thousand times, ten thousand times more important than food.”

Stunned, Mo Yesi looked down and smelled a faint strawberry scent.

His little wife looked up at him. “Listen, I won’t allow you to doubt your charm. You’re very important to me. No one can compare to you. I might get sick of eating the food I like every day, but the person I like will only weigh more and more in my heart.

“Do you have so little confidence in me?”

Did she not seem to like him enough?

The man looked deeply into her eyes and said hoarsely, “Am I very important to you?”

“Mm.”

“How important?”

“Very, very important.” Qiao Mianmian felt that she had to give Mo Yesi some confidence. She couldn’t let him be so worried.

Thus, she exaggerated. “I can’t live without you. With you, I feel that my life is meaningful. If I lose you, I won’t have the meaning and motivation to continue living.

“Do you think a fish can live without water? You’re my water, my source of life.”

She wondered if she sounded too mushy and insincere. Just as she was about to say something to salvage the situation, a faint smile appeared on the man’s handsome face.
