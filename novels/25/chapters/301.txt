Chapter 304: Will You Stop Disgusting Me?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

That was her own artiste, but Linda couldn’t help but feel afraid of her two-faced ways.

Seeing Qiao Anxin’s “sweet” smile disgusted Qiao Mianmian as well. She didn’t bother hiding her unhappiness and coldly said, “Qiao Anxin, don’t call me Sister in future. We don’t have to be so hypocritical. Let’s just address each other by name.

“Otherwise, I’ll feel disgusted to hear it. You’re grossed out by saying it, and I’m worse off hearing it. Su Ze isn’t around now, and there’s no one to admire your performance, so you don’t have to be so dedicated.”

She was mean with every word she said.

There was no need to save any face for Qiao Anxin.

Jiang Luoli felt so good hearing that. She almost gave Qiao Mianmian a thumbs-up right there.

Her Baby was terrific.

She didn’t even use a single vulgarity on Qiao Anxin to make her turn pale from anger.

This rotten lily deserved to be treated like that.

“Sister, you...” Qiao Anxin was already looking awful, but she didn’t want to ruin her image.

There were so many other people in the lobby.

And she was a well-known artiste now.

Her every move was always being watched by countless pairs of eyes.

Her image would get tarnished if she didn’t watch herself.

“No, no, no.” Qiao Mianmian waved a finger at her face, ignoring the fury in her eyes. She smiled and said, “Qiao Anxin, I already told you that I feel disgusted when you address me this way. Please don’t continue to disgust me, okay?

“Just call me by my name. Anyway, I don’t have such a shameless sister.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Y-You...” Qiao Anxin’s expression distorted as she fumed with anger.

She lifted her hand as if about to slap Qiao Mianmian on the face.

“Anxin.” Linda quietly reminded her. “Watch your image. People are watching, don’t fall into her trap.”

Qiao Anxin was stunned as she looked up and found that there were indeed people looking in her direction.

One of them was her arch-enemy.

She quickly retracted her arm.

But the anger in her eyes was still present.

She glared at Qiao Mianmian and clenched her teeth as she lowered her voice. “Qiao Mianmian, you’re too much.”

“Ay, finally.” Qiao Mianmian casually said to Jiang Luoli, “She finally understood what I’ve been trying to tell her. Thank goodness I don’t have to continue feeling disgusted by her. Otherwise, my dinner from last night would be all over the floor by now.”

Jiang Luoli would jump at any chance to insult Qiao Anxin, and at this point, she nodded approvingly. “Mm, even I was disgusted, not to mention you. No wonder it smelled so pungent just now, it must’ve been this vixen.”

Qiao Anxin was a popular star now and had just become Su Ze’s official girlfriend. She was getting everything she wanted.

And was smugger than ever before.

Everyone around her flattered her to get into her good books.

When had she last been humiliated like that?

It was bad enough that Qiao Mianmian insulted her like that.

But what right had Jiang Luoli to do the same?

She was going mad.

But in such a setting, she had no choice but to swallow her anger.

Her face practically inflated with all the anger she was holding in, and the look she shot Jiang Luoli was so menacing it seemed like she wanted to skin her alive.
