Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Hanging up and turning around, she picked up her bag and took out a palm-sized doll.

A few needles could be seen stuck on the doll.

Qiao Anxin took out a needle and stabbed it into the doll’s heart.

Her eyes were filled with hatred, and her expression was ferocious. She gritted her teeth and growled. “Qiao Mianmian, slut, go to hell, go to hell!

“You’ll die a terrible death!

“B*tch, I’ll curse you every day. You’ll definitely die a horrible death! I’ll wait for that day!”

...

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t interested in Qiao Anxin being on the hot searches.

After all, Qiao Anxin was someone she didn’t care about.

In her eyes, Qiao Anxin was just a clown.

As long as she didn’t jump too hard, Qiao Mianmian wouldn’t do anything to her.

But if she was aggressive, it was easy to deal with her.

After leaving Star Splendor, Qiao Anxin was like a dog that had lost its owner.

It wasn’t as good as before.

She heard that even some third-tier brands were unwilling to endorse her.

The entertainment industry was full of newbies.

Qiao Anxin relied on Star Splendor’s resources to get to the top.

She was too weak without it. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

And now, it was impossible for her to find another company that was willing to support her like Star Splendor.

Qiao Anxin’s trending topics quickly faded.

Quan Dong was one of the most powerful figures in the entertainment industry. It was easy for him to settle such a small trending topic. But the way he solved Qiao Anxin’s trending topic was to get the other artistes in the company to get on the trending list.

Using the scandals of those small artistes to suppress Qiao Anxin’s trending topics.

The poor little artistes were sacrificed because they didn’t bring enough benefits to the company.

After suppressing the trending topics, Quan Dong found high-quality fake reviewers to help Qiao Anxin with her scandals. After a few days, the trending topics were completely suppressed.

The trending topics this time were like bubbles that didn’t affect her at all.

Qiao Mianmian, on the other hand, gained a lot of new fans because of her acting.

With a single trailer, her fans increased by more than 500,000.

Qiao Mianmian had wanted to rest for two months after this new drama wrapped up.

But she’d only rested for a week when Linda called her and said that she’d helped her take on a variety show.

It was a very popular variety show, and many companies were fighting to get their artistes on it.

As all the artistes on that variety show had gone viral, that variety show was also nicknamed “Star Creation”.

Everyone wanted to appear on this popular show.

Many A-list celebrities were fighting for a slot.

“Mianmian, it wasn’t easy for the company to get this slot. Our company only has one quota. Who knows how many people want to go? I’ve asked around, maybe even Shen Fei will go.”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t expect Linda to sign another variety show for her so quickly.

She knew about this variety show because she’d seen it before.

It was indeed very popular with high viewership ratings. The artistes who appeared on that show all became popular.
