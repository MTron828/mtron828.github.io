Chapter 1818: I Guess I’ll Really Have Nothing to Drink Today

The basket of lotus roots was sold out in less than an hour.

A group of people counted the “hard-earned money” they earned with their hard work and sweat. They felt extremely satisfied and accomplished.

This amount of money was nothing to them.

Normally, it wasn’t even enough for a meal.

But at this moment, no one would complain about the lack of money. Everyone had a satisfied and happy expression.

“If we knew it was so easy to sell, we should have gotten more.” Zhan Bo was a little upset that they dug too little.

“That’s right.” Su Mufei also said, “According to the time, we completed the mission in advance. I didn’t expect our first mission to be so smooth.”

“Then, aren’t we fine now? I wonder how Sister Fei’s team is doing.”

“Why don’t we take a look?”

Everyone looked at Qiao Mianmian and waited for her decision.

Qiao Mianmian thought that she had already completed her task and had nothing to do now, so she nodded and said, “Mm, let’s go over and take a look.”

After making up their minds, they packed up and headed to Shen Fei’s place.

...

Shen Fei was at the same market as them.

A few minutes later, Qiao Mianmian and Zhan Bo went over.

There weren’t many people in front of Shen Fei’s stall. Even if one or two people went over occasionally and asked a few questions, they left without buying anything.

The lotus root that Shen Fei and the rest dug out was basically broken lotus root. It didn’t look good enough, and it didn’t make people want to buy it.

They had packed so much when they came, but they still hadn’t sold much.

They had been setting up the stall for more than an hour, but they hadn’t sold anything. It was obvious that they weren’t in a good mood.

Moreover, it was mainly Shen Fei and Han Yan yelling. Little Xiao, Qiao Anxin, and the other two just stood there like decorations.

“Mianmian, why are you here?” Shen Fei was shocked to see Qiao Mianmian and the rest. “Have you sold all of them?”

“Mm, Sister Shen, we’ve sold out. We came to see how your progress is.”

They walked to the stall and saw that Shen Fei didn’t have much business. Su Mufei said, “Sister Fei, don’t you have any business here? Why do I feel like you haven’t sold anything?”

Shen Fei opened her mouth, but before she could say anything, Han Yan said unhappily, “There’s no business at all. No one is here to buy anything. I think we’re going to starve today.”

Shen Fei’s expression was a little awkward. She sighed and said, “Maybe our things aren’t good enough. Many people asked for the price and left. It’s almost two hours, and we haven’t sold anything. I think we’ll really have nothing to eat today.”

“It shouldn’t be that bad.” Song Ke stood at the side and bit her lip. “Is the production crew really not going to care about us and let us starve?”

“Is it that bad? Didn’t you watch last week’s show?” Han Yan was regretting it now. Why didn’t he make a choice earlier and join Qiao Mianmian’s team?

Following Song Ke was like bringing a few burden.
