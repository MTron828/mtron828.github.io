Chapter 101: I Can’t Possibly Go Dutch

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Jiang Luoli was speechless.

It wasn’t possible to return a dish even at a small eatery.

Let alone at a place like this!

She was even more certain now that Bai Xiao and Zhang Yuwei were being deliberate.

But she had no idea what exactly they were thinking.

Qiao Mianmian had never offended them before, and they hadn’t had any feuds between them.

Why were they doing this so suddenly...

“Yeah, high-end places like this usually serve small portions. We were worried that it wouldn’t be filling, so we added more dishes.” Bai Xiao and Zhang Yuwei were evidently on the same side.

“Moreover, didn’t Mianmian say we could order as much as we wanted? We didn’t force her to say it, she said it herself. If she’s worried that she can’t foot the bill later, then she shouldn’t have put on such a false front.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

This was going overboard.

Jiang Luoli frowned. “Bai Xiao, how could you put it this way? Mianmian was being nice to give us a treat, is this any wrong?”

Qiao Mianmian could feel the tension rising and was afraid that they would start arguing. She reached out and grabbed Jiang Luoli’s hand. “Luo Luo, it’s fine. I offered to give a treat, so I hope everyone will enjoy this meal. Let’s not get upset over this.”

“It’s fine even if we don’t finish it. We could always pack the leftovers and take them away.”

Jiang Luoli pouted. “I’m just saying that you’re being nice to offer us this treat, but not everyone appreciates it.”

“Bam—” Bai Xiao slammed her chopsticks on the table.

She turned towards Jiang Luoli and scoffed. “Jiang Luoli, what do you mean by that?”

Zhang Yuwei frowned as well and spoke in an unpleasant tone. “It’s not as if we were dying for this meal. Jiang Luoli, you don’t have to make us feel like we owe Mianmian a huge favor. If you feel that we’re taking advantage of her here, then we can just go dutch.”

Zhang Yuwei said this, but she surely didn’t mean it.

She knew Qiao Mianmian well enough to be sure that she wouldn’t allow them to go dutch.

If they were to go dutch, she wouldn’t be able to afford it.

Bai Xiao didn’t know what she was thinking and immediately panicked. “Why should we go dutch? It’s Qiao Mianmian who said she wanted to pay for this meal. She picked this place and it’s so expensive, how could we go dutch?

“In any case, I can’t possibly go dutch.”

Bai Xiao made it clear first, just in case they decided to split the bill later.

She wasn’t going to be able to afford it!

She saw just how expensive the dishes were when they were ordering them.

She did a quick calculation and concluded that it would cost roughly twenty to thirty thousand yuan.

“H-How could you guys be like that?” Jiang Luoli was furious. “What do you mean by ‘not dying for this meal’? Mianmian was just being nice, and this is what she gets in return? Zhang Yuwei, Bai Xiao, aren’t you guys being too much?”

The tension was building up terribly.

At this point, Zhang Yuwei and Bai Xiao had also realized that they had gone too far.

But it was too late. They couldn’t take their words back.

Since they had already offended her, there was no point in trying to salvage things.

Bai Xiao’s expression went cold as she said, “Qiao Mianmian, for this meal, were you planning to just give us a treat, or do you have other motives? Only you have the answer.”
