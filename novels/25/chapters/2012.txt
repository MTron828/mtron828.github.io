Chapter 2013: I Won’t Let You Off

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Old Madam was about to speak when a housemaid walked over.

“Old Madam, Madam, the Shangguan family is here.”

Old Madam was stunned. “The Shangguan family? Why are they here?”

Mo Yesi narrowed his eyes when he heard that.

“Quickly, invite them in.” The Mo family wasn’t familiar with the Shangguan family. One was in Yuncheng City, and the other was in another city.

But because they’d met a few times, they knew each other.

However, their relationship was very ordinary..

The Shangguan family was also prominent, so Old Madam spoke politely.

Soon, she heard footsteps.

A petite female voice sounded. “Dad, why do you have to make me come here? I’ve told you, I have something on later. I’ve made an appointment with a friend…”

“Shut up.” An angry voice reprimanded the girl. “Be good and apologize to him later. If you don’t do this well, I’ll deduct all your allowance.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Dad!”

“I told you to shut up. Behave yourself later. If you cause any trouble, I won’t let you off.”

Old Madam frowned when she heard the conversation.

Qiao Mianmian looked up and saw a couple walking in.

She didn’t know the man, but she knew the woman.

It was Shangguan Qing.

Shangguan Qing looked reluctant, as if she was being forced to do something.

Although Qiao Mianmian had never seen the man beside her, she heard Shangguan Qing call him Dad.

This man must be her father.

They looked alike.

Shangguan Hua walked in with Shangguan Qing.

Shangguan Qing suddenly saw Qiao Mianmian sitting on the sofa. Stunned, her eyes widened in shock. “Qiao Mianmian, why are you here!”

Shangguan Hua frowned.

“Qingqing, you haven’t greeted Old Madam and Madam Mo. What did I tell you before we came? Why are you yelling!”

“No, Dad.” Shangguan Qing pointed at Qiao Mianmian and said angrily and in shock, “Do you know that Brother Zeli refuses to agree to the marriage because of this vixen? She’s a shameless woman who specializes in seducing other men.”

Besides Madam Mo, Old Madam and Mo Yesi’s expressions darkened.

Especially Mo Yesi.

Old Madam threw the cup of tea that the housemaid brought over onto the ground.

The sound of the teacup hitting the ground stunned Shangguan Qing.

She looked up and saw Old Madam looking at her coldly. Her heart skipped a beat.

She couldn’t make a sound.

“Where did this wild girl come from? How dare she say that to Young Madam Mo?!”

Old Madam knew Shangguan Hua, so she actually knew Shangguan Qing’s identity.

She said that on purpose.

“What, this vixen is the Young Madam of the Mo family? Are you mistaken? She’s just a lowly actress, how could she be the Young Madam of the Mo family?” Shangguan Qing was in disbelief.

She said excitedly, “You must be mistaken.”

“How dare you!” Old Madam’s expression darkened. “Uncle Zhang, get someone to chase this unruly girl out immediately.”
