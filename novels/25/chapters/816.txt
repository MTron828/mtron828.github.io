Chapter 817: She Felt That Her Hubby Was So Handsome

She picked it up.

The man’s low and magnetic voice could be heard. “You’re back in Yuncheng City? Where are you now? I’ll get Wei Zheng to pick you up.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “How did you know I was back?”

He chuckled again. “Your fan posted on Weibo saying that she met you at Yuncheng City Airport. You didn’t even inform me that you were coming back. Are you trying to give me a surprise?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She almost forgot about it.

No wonder he knew she was back.

It turned out that he saw her fan’s post.

“Where?” Mo Yesi asked again. “You didn’t look for me immediately when you came back. Where did you go?”

“Something happened to Luo Luo, so I went over to accompany her first. I just got into a taxi. I’m coming.” Qiao Mianmian had wanted to give him a surprise, but now she couldn’t.

Mo Yesi sounded shocked. “Jiang Luoli? What happened to her?”

Qiao Mianmian kept quiet for a while. “Uh, it’s not convenient for me to say it now. I’ll tell you when I’m there.”

“Alright, give me a call when you’re about to arrive. I’ll come down to pick you up.”

“Pick me up?”

“Mm, why?”

“It’s nothing. You always got Wei Zheng to come down.”

“Mm, I really missed you today and wanted to see you sooner.”

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but chuckle. “Mr. Mo, I think we just parted this morning. Aren’t you exaggerating?”

Mo Yesi said seriously, “Mm, we split up in the morning. It’s been almost 10 hours since morning. To me, I hope my baby can be by my side every second. Isn’t it normal after being apart for so long?”

“... Alright.”

Even after being teased by Mo Yesi so many times, Qiao Mianmian still couldn’t take it. His sweet words could make her heart race.

...

Twenty minutes later, the taxi stopped at the Mo Corporation building.

Qiao Mianmian got off the car and walked into the lobby.

As she entered the lobby, she saw the elevator doors open, and Mo Yesi walked out.

Even if this man was already her husband.

Even if she was already very familiar with him.

But every time she saw him, Qiao Mianmian’s heart would flutter.

Her gaze landed on the man’s handsome face, and her heart rate accelerated as she watched him walk towards her.

She felt that her husband was really handsome.

How could he... be so handsome.

That face and that figure were enough to beat any young hunk in the entertainment industry.

If he wasn’t the company’s Chairman, he could definitely make a living with his looks. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

And such a handsome man was already her husband.

She was secretly happy for a while as if she had found a gem.

Just as she was smitten with Mo Yesi, the other female employees in the lobby were also stealing glances at their boss. Even Qiao Mianmian couldn’t resist Mo Yesi’s charm and was smitten with him, let alone the others.

The female employees were all blushing, and their eyes were filled with passion. The moment Mo Yesi walked out of the elevator, they couldn’t help but straighten their chests and brush their hair as they smiled sweetly, wanting to show him their most beautiful side.

Even though they had heard that Chairman Mo had a girlfriend recently and doted on her a lot.
