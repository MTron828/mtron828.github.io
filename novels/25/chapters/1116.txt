Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She widened her eyes in shock. “It can’t be... 30... 30 million?!”

“Yes, 30 million.” Linda smiled. “Actually, when MC signed with other endorsers, they gave about the same amount. But I thought that because you’re still new and not famous enough, they wouldn’t give you the price of an A-list celebrity.

“I’ m surprised they didn’t reduce their endorsement fees.

“Of course, I know you’re with President Mo now and you don’t lack money. Perhaps thirty million yuan is...”

“It’s a lot! I’m very satisfied! Thank you, Sister Xie!” Qiao Mianmian interrupted her excitedly. “And Sister Xie, I’m short of money. I’m dating Mo Yesi, and he’s very generous to me, but I still hope to use my own money.”

Linda looked at her for a while and nodded. “I understand. There are indeed some things that feel safer in one’s hands. How about this, I’ll call them now and sign the contract? As for when to shoot the advertisement, that will depend on their arrangements.”

“Okay.”

After getting Qiao Mianmian’s approval, Linda took out her phone and made a call.

...

In another room in the same clubhouse.

The CEO of the MC brand stood respectfully beside a man.

“Young Master Gong, the contract with Miss Qiao has been finalized. Now, we just need to wait for Miss Qiao to sign the contract before we can choose a time to shoot the advertisement for the next season.”

As the brand’s CEO reported, he looked down at the man sitting on the sofa and felt a little depressed.

They had already chosen the spokesperson for the next season.

Moreover, they had already agreed to sign the contract.

He was also very satisfied with that spokesperson. Regardless of whether it was appearance or fame, he was definitely an artist who could increase the next season’s sales.

But Young Master Gong suddenly requested to give the endorsement for the next season to a newbie with the surname Qiao.

It was fine if they were newcomers.

But it was a newbie who couldn’t be any newer. A pure rookie who didn’t have any works.

He had asked someone to take a look.

That newbie only had over a million followers on Weibo, which was completely incomparable to the artist he had his eyes on.

Moreover, her one million fans were all hyped up by scandals.

It was no different from having no fans.

In short, the brand’s boss was dissatisfied with Gong Zeli’s newbie.

But no matter how dissatisfied he was, he did not dare to show it.

He was MC’s CEO.

But the entire MC belonged to the Gong Corporation.

The young master of the Gong family wanted this female artist to be the spokesperson for the next season. Who would dare to object?

Even if he chose a primary school student.

As long as Young Master Gong liked it, it was up to him.

In any case, whether the sales were good or not, the Gong Corporation would be the one losing out.

If even he didn’t care about it, what else could others say?

However, what the brand’s boss didn’t understand was, was Young Master Gong really interested in that newbie?

Previously, he had seen all kinds of rumors.

However, at that time, those staying by Young Master Gong’s side for a few years did not take those rumors seriously.

Because they all knew that Young Master Gong liked the Shen family lady.

All these years, Young Master Gong had many female companions, but he had never officially dated a single one, which was also the same for the Shen family lady.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m
