Chapter 1275: Their Scheme Didn’t Succeed

Madam Bai’s voice turned cold. “Yusheng didn’t invite Qiao Anxin to his dinner at all, but she brought her here. Moreover, they didn’t have much of a relationship before this, but they were like close sisters that night.

“Everything was just for their scheme.

“I was foolish to fall for their tricks. If Yusheng wasn’t smart, they would have succeeded.”

Madam Bai got angrier as she spoke.

At that time, the bad guy’s scheme would succeed, but her biological daughter would never be able to reunite with her.

How hateful!

She looked up at Qiao Mianmian with soft eyes. “Thankfully, their scheme didn’t succeed. Mianmian, can Aunt ask you for a favor?”

Qiao Mianmian was still in a daze.

She felt strange when she saw Shen Rou and Qiao Anxin together that night.

She wondered when they became so close.

So, they were plotting to get Qiao Anxin to pretend to be the daughter of the Bai family.

“Aunt, what do you want me to help you with?” Qiao Mianmian was stunned for a while before coming back to her senses.

Madam Bai held her hand and hesitated for a few seconds before looking straight into her eyes. “Mianmian, Yusheng and I suspect that the blood we did the paternity test with me was yours. Shen Rou planned the blood donation to get your blood.

“So, you’re actually my daughter.”

Qiao Mianmian widened her eyes.

“Auntie, you...”

“Let me finish.” Madam Bai’s voice softened a few degrees. “Qiao Anxin and I are definitely not biological mother and daughter. Ever since Yusheng suspected her identity, I found a way to take some of her hair and do another test.

“The results are almost out.

“If she really isn’t related to me by blood, then the blood at the hospital definitely isn’t hers.

“Mianmian, if that blood isn’t hers, who else could it be?” Madam Bai looked at her steadily. “The most likely possibility is that they took your blood to do this paternity test.

“The paternity test results are correct. So...”

Qiao Mianmian felt Madam Bai tighten her grip on her hand. “If the blood is yours, you’re my Little Seven. Mianmian, Aunt hopes to do a paternity test with you.

“Y-You can promise Auntie?”

Before Qiao Mianmian could reply, a housemaid walked towards them.

“Madam, Miss Qiao,” the housemaid said respectfully. “Madam, Dr. Kaiwei said that he has done what you asked. Please go over now.”

Madam Bai’s expression changed slightly.

She said to Qiao Mianmian, “The results must be out. Mianmian, can you go with Aunt?”

Qiao Mianmian knew that Madam Bai was eager to find her daughter, and she didn’t mind doing a paternity test. It was just a piece of cake for her.

Although Madam Bai had told her so much, she still felt that she couldn’t be the daughter of the Bai family.

She met Madam Bai’s expectant gaze and nodded. “Alright, Auntie. I’ll go with you.”Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com
