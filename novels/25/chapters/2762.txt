Chapter 2765: Must Be Planning Something

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Damn, I thought Qiao Mianmian was doing another live stream. What’s the production crew doing? How did they get a newbie who looks so similar to Qiao Mianmian to join this episode? Also, why did they change Zhizhi? I like her.”

“Just now, Zhizhi posted on Weibo that the production crew unilaterally breached the contract and requested for it to be terminated at the last minute. In order to groom such a newbie, the production crew doesn’t even have the basic integrity? What exactly is this woman’s background? Isn’t the production crew afraid that they will be affected?”

“I just checked. This Jiang Xinyue is a newbie signed by the Gong Corporation’s entertainment company. From the looks of it, they’re preparing to groom her.”

“An artiste under the Gong Corporation who looks like Qiao Mianmian? I suddenly recalled the rumors between the Young Master of the Gong family and Qiao Mianmian. Could this woman be a substitute that the Young Master Gong got? He couldn’t get the original, so he got a substitute to pamper?”

In less than 10 minutes.

This was the first time Qiao Anxin appeared on trending.

Mo Yesi didn’t stay long after sending Qiao Mianmian to C City. He packed everything up and returned to Yuncheng City. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The camera was placed indoors, and there was no need for the crew to follow Qiao Mianmian.

Hence, she was left alone in the room.

Qiao Mianmian asked Zhan Bo when he would arrive, and he replied that he would be there in half an hour.

The cell phone on the bed rang.

Qiao Mianmian walked over and saw that it was Linda. “Sister Xie.”

“Damn, Mianmian. Did you see the trending searches?” Linda sounded out of sorts.

Qiao Mianmian asked, “Not yet, I just got my cell phone. Did something happen?”

Although she didn’t know what it was, Qiao Mianmian was sure that it had something to do with her.

After all, if it had nothing to do with her, Linda wouldn’t have called her.

“I don’t know what the production crew is doing. They suddenly replaced Zhizhi. And do you know, the newbie they out in her place is actually a newbie who looks like you? The netizens are all discussing this.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

Linda continued, “And this newbie is from the Gong Corporation’s entertainment company. Do you know who’s in charge of the company now? It’s that jerk Su Ze!

“Say, that jerk Su Ze made a newbie who looks like you participate in the same show as you. What exactly is he up to? I feel like he definitely doesn’t have good intentions. He must be plotting something.

“The Su Corporation was acquired by Chairman Mo. He went from a young master of a prestigious family to trash. He must be bearing a grudge. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have gone to Gong Zeli’s company after breaking his relationship with Chairman Mo.”

Qiao Mianmian frowned. “Zhizhi was replaced? When?”

“Just now,” Linda said angrily. “Zhizhi’s fans are asking for an explanation on the production crew’s official Weibo account because of this. A newbie is making her debut on such a good variety show.. Does Su Ze want to groom Jiang Xinyue like he did Qiao Anxin in the past?”
