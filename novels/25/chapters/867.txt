Chapter 868: She Was Really Afraid

“Mo, Ye, Si!”

“Alright, alright, let’s eat first.” Mo Yesi knew that he would really anger the kitten if he continued teasing her. “But I don’t want to go out to eat. I’ll just stay in the room and order takeaway.”

“Then, can you let me turn on the lights first...”

“Let’s go to my room.” Mo Yesi wrapped his arm around her waist and led her out. “I’ve booked a room, yours is too small.”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t say anything and followed him out.

Actually, her room wasn’t small at all.

But to Mo Yesi, it was too small.

This man only lived in the presidential suite when he was out.

...

Upstairs.

Mo Yesi opened the door and walked into the room before Qiao Mianmian did.

When she reached the living room, she saw him walking towards her with a bouquet of pink roses.

He handed her the flowers. “I passed by a florist and bought a bouquet.”

Qiao Mianmian took the flowers from him and felt amused.

Mo Yesi was really a typical straight man.

He’d given her flowers previously, and she’d expressed her liking for them. Then, he’d given her this every time.

Moreover, it was always the same pink roses.

Actually, besides pink roses, she liked many flowers.

“Thank you, Hubby. I really like it.” Although he was a typical straight man, Qiao Mianmian still tiptoed and kissed him on the cheek.

He even thought of buying her flowers when he passed by the florist.

It meant that she was always in his heart.

It felt great to be remembered by others at all times.

Just as she was about to back off, Mo Yesi wrapped his arm around her waist and pulled her towards him. He lowered his head and breathed on her cheek. “What did you call me just now? I didn’t hear you clearly. Call me again.”

He liked it when she called him Hubby.

Qiao Mianmian glared at him. “You heard me clearly, you definitely did.”

“No.” Mo Yesi lied through his teeth. “I really didn’t hear you clearly. Baby, repeat it, alright?”

“No!”

The man hugged her too tightly, and Qiao Mianmian pushed him away. “Mo Yesi, let go of me. I’ll put the flowers down.

“I told you to let go of me.”

Mo Yesi refused to let go of her. His handsome face inched closer to her, and his breath became hot. “You called me just now, why are you embarrassed now?”

Qiao Mianmian glared at him. “Didn’t you say you didn’t hear me clearly?”

“Mm, I’m not sure. I just heard you call me Hubby? Baby, tell me, did I hear wrongly?”

The man was getting closer.

That handsome and deep face enlarged before her eyes.

Qiao Mianmian’s heart skipped a beat when she felt his breath getting warmer. She looked up and saw his dark eyes. She panicked and placed her hand on his chest. “Hubby!”

She was really afraid. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

She could feel that he had been suppressing his desires since last night.

He wanted to touch her, but he held it in.

It wouldn’t be nice to hold it in.

Qiao Mianmian felt her legs go weak.

She felt like... she hadn’t recovered yet.
