Chapter 725: The Man Above Her

Was he supposed to watch the beauty fall to the ground and not do anything?

That was inhuman.

But that male celebrity had placed his hand on Young Madam’s waist for too long.

Chairman Mo was probably angry about this.

“Ahem, Chairman Mo.”

Wei Zheng knew that Mo Yesi was in a bad mood, so he spoke cautiously. “I’ve already investigated the matter you asked me to investigate. This incident was probably caused by an actress in the same crew as Young Madam. That actress is called Huang Yilin, and she’s the female lead. I heard she likes Bai Yusheng.

“She misunderstood that Bai Yusheng likes Young Madam and saw her as a love rival. Hence, she wanted to use this scandal to get Tu Yilei’s fans to attack Young Madam. Oh right, there’s news about the matter that Chairman Mo asked me to investigate.”

Mo Yesi slowly looked up.

Wei Zheng only met his gaze for a second before looking away in fear.

Gosh, Chairman Mo’s gaze was too terrifying.

It was so cold.

He almost froze.

But he could understand Chairman Mo’s feelings.

“Ahem! Chairman Mo, we found out who the culprit behind Young Madam’s scandal with Su... Su Ze was.” Wei Zheng kept quiet for a while before glancing at Mo Yesi’s expression. “We found out that it might have something to do with Miss Shen.”

“Shen Rou?”

Mo Yesi finally reacted.

“Yes.” Wei Zheng told him everything that he’d found out. “Although we can’t be completely sure, it’s definitely related to Miss Shen. We caught a few key managers of that company. They said that a female customer hired them and contacted them with a set of virtual numbers. After we deciphered the number, we found that the number was called from the Shen family.

“The rest of the Shen family don’t know Young Madam, only Miss Shen...”

Mo Yesi’s eyes turned cold. “Investigate that female artist named Huang Yilin and dig out all the dirt about her past. Then, get the public relations department to do something about it and increase her popularity.”

“Yes, Chairman Mo.”

“But...” Wei Zheng suddenly thought of something. “She’s Bai Yusheng’s current female lead. If we expose her, wouldn’t Bai Yusheng be in trouble?”

Once the news got out, it would definitely have a huge impact on the artistes.

Especially when Mo Yesi was prepared to let the Mo Corporation’s public relations department handle the dirt.

He was ready to destroy Huang Yilin.

Huang Yilin was really unlucky.

If it was any other newbie, she would just bully them.

It wasn’t uncommon in the entertainment industry.

As a newcomer, if they didn’t have a strong background and backing, who could develop smoothly?

Huang Yilin probably thought that Young Madam was just a newbie with no background and easy to bully.

She felt that Young Madam had stolen her man and wanted to teach her a lesson.

But who knew...

She was wrong this time. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Not only was she bullying a newcomer with a powerful background, but she was also bullying a newcomer with a background that she would never have imagined.

Then, she got herself burned.

It seemed like Chairman Mo wasn’t going to let Huang Yilin off.
