The ladies were jealous, and their comments were really nasty.

However, as they were really soft and at a distance from Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi, the two of them didn’t hear what they said.

Mo Yesi noticed that the flowers were a bit too heavy for Qiao Mianmian and offered to carry them for her. He then said, “I’ll put it in the car.”

Qiao Mianmian was grateful for his gesture.

The flowers were indeed too heavy for her. Her arms were starting to ache after holding them for just a short while.

The two of them then strolled to the car.

Mo Yesi fished out the keys and opened the car. He then placed the flowers in the backseat.

After that, he went to the side and opened the doors for her. He smiled and said, “Miss Qiao, please get in.”

Mo Yesi’s gentlemanly behavior attracted the attention of a group of girls nearby.

Girls were attracted to gentlemen.

Girls were even more attracted if they were rich and handsome.

Qiao Mianmian walked over while others stared at her.

As she was about to get in the car, a familiar voice could be heard behind her. “Mister, you were swindled by Qiao Mianmian. She isn’t who she portrays herself to be.”

Qiao Mianmian was shocked by the comment and turned around.

It was Bai Xiao and Zhang Yuwei. They were walking towards her together.

The voice just now belonged to Bai Xiao.

This was the second time Bai Xiao met Mo Yesi, and she was really excited. Even though she tried her best to hide it, her expression was of excitement.

Mo Yesi narrowed his eyes and stared at her coldly.

As she met his cold glance, Bai Xiao felt her heartbeat speeding up. She was nervous yet excited about what was about to happen.

She walked quickly to Mo Yesi and clenched her fists. She took a deep breath and said, “Mister, we have met before. I’m Qiao Mianmian’s roommate.”

As he looked at the woman feeling so good about herself, Mo Yesi frowned and replied coldly, “Miss, I have no idea who you are. Please stop behaving as though we are friends.”

Bai Xiao frowned at being publicly humiliated.

The girls standing nearby heard it and started to make fun of her. “Haha, who’s that girl. How can she say such things with her looks?”

“Yes, why would he remember her. Does she think she’s that pretty.”

“Did you realize that her eyes lit up when she saw him? Is she trying to steal the guy from her roommate?”

“But that guy is awesome. He denied knowing her straight away. Hahaha. He embarrassed her.”

“You guys are thinking too much into it. He wasn’t trying to embarrass her. He just simply doesn’t know her. But she felt so good about herself that she thought he would remember her.”

The girls’ voices weren’t soft.

Bai Xiao heard all of it.

At that moment, she felt embarrassed and upset.

But she needed to maintain her sweet and nice image in front of Mo Yesi. Hence, she couldn’t act out in anger.

She bit her lip and suppressed her anger. After that, she smiled and said, “Mister, I’m Bai Xiao. I was Qiao Mianmian’s roommate for 3 years. We used to be really close. But because of a misunderstanding...”
