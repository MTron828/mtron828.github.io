Chapter 460: You Need to Change Your Attitude

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Gong Zeli bit his lip and glared at him.

“It wasn’t you?” Yan Shaoqing asked, raising his eyebrows. “It wasn’t me, either. I wonder who could it be?”

Yan Shaoqing already knew the answer to his own question.

The only person who could bring Shen Rou to tears was Mo Yesi.

They were definitely incapable of doing so.

But he had to pretend that he didn’t know anything.

He didn’t know how to console her after finding out.

He already said everything that he had to say.

If she had listened to his advice, she wouldn’t be like this now.

However, if she wasn’t willing to take his advice at all, she would go down the same path regardless of what he said.

Yan Shaoqing felt that Shen Rou did not have to go through all these.

Everyone knew that she was in love with Mo Yesi from a young age.

But Mo Yesi didn’t share the same sentiments for her.

Even though Mo Yesi acted coldly to everyone, he would have confessed his feelings, if he had any, for Shen Rou a long time ago.

He wasn’t one to bottle up his feelings and not say anything for years.

It was obvious from how he treated Qiao Mianmian now.

He would be the one to take the initiative in the relationship.

He acted coldly towards everyone all these years because he hadn’t met anyone he liked.

Now that he had met someone he liked, he would be the one taking the initiative all the time.

Even if Mo Yesi wasn’t going to marry Qiao Mianmian, the next person in line wouldn’t be Shen Rou either.

It was a simple fact that everyone could understand. Shen Rou must have understood as well.

Yet, she...

“Rourou, you can tell Fourth Bro and I if you are wronged in any way. We have known each other for so long already. If there’s anyone who dares to bully you, tell us and we will help you.”

Shen Rou bit her lip and held tightly to a pillow next to her.

She kept silent for a moment with a difficult look on her face before replying with a husky voice, “It’s not that important, let’s not talk about it.”

“Stop crying, then,” Yan Shaoqing replied as he looked at her. “If we’re coming out to play, we should be having fun. Don’t let other things affect our mood.

“And you...”

Yan Shaoqing frowned as he asked Gong Zeli, “You’re arguing with Second Bro again? Fourth Bro, I really don’t want to scold you, but what are you thinking of? Do you want to cut off our kinship?”

Gong Zeli and Yan Shaoqing were close. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

He was aware of quite some things.

Mo Yesi was cold and impatient. Hence, Gong Zeli would always approach Yan Shaoqing if he had issues.

But after knowing that Gong Zeli argued with Mo Yesi two times already, Yan Shaoqing was speechless.

He couldn’t understand Gong Zeli’s behavior.

Gong Zeli bit his lip and frowned. After he went silent for a while, he replied coldly, “Of course not.”

They had been brothers for ten over years.

How could he just cut it off just like that?

He only said all that at the heat of the moment.

“So you...” Yan Shaoqing sighed and continued, “If you value this kinship, you need to change your attitude.”

Yan Shaoqing wasn’t being direct.

But everyone knew that he was referring to Gong Zeli’s attitude towards Qiao Mianmian.

He wasn’t sure why.

But when he thought about Qiao Mianmian, he couldn’t help but have some weird feelings.

He recalled the previous time that he met her in the mall. She felt familiar to him.

Especially her fragrance.
