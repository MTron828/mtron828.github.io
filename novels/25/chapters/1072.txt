Chapter 1073: Don’t Get Involved in This

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

It seemed like their Madam and Young Master were trying to matchmake Young Master and Miss Shen.

They thought that they would be able to get along well with each other.

Bai Yusheng returned to the hall.

Madam Bai and Madam Shen couldn’t help but ask at the same time, “Where’s Rourou? Why isn’t she back with you?”

Bai Yusheng lied casually. “Miss Shen said that our garden has good scenery, and she wants to walk around alone.”

Madam Shen and Madam Bai looked at each other in disbelief.

Madam Shen frowned and was about to get up to look for her when Shen Rou walked in.

“Mom, Aunt Bai.” She walked into the living room and saw Bai Yusheng. Her expression darkened.

“Rourou, why are you and Yusheng back so soon?” Madam Shen looked at her daughter and then at Bai Yusheng with a hint of doubt in her eyes. “Aren’t you going to walk for a while more?”

“No.” Shen Rou forced a stiff smile. “Mom, I suddenly feel unwell. Let’s go back.”

“Unwell? Where are you feeling unwell?” Madam Shen asked nervously.

Shen Rou’s smile stiffened. “I can’t put my finger on it. I just feel uncomfortable.”

“Rourou, are you feeling unwell?” Madam Bai asked. “Do you need a doctor?”

“Aunt Bai, thank you for your concern. But I don’t think there’s a need to call a doctor. I should just go back and rest.”

“Alright, then.” Madam Bai nodded. “In that case, go back and have a good rest. Come over and accompany Aunt Bai when the sky changes.”

Madam Shen was also very worried about her daughter. She thought that Shen Rou was really unwell and didn’t have the mood to stay in the Bai family anymore.

She immediately stood up and said, “Sister Bai, I’ll take Rourou and Xinxin back first. Let’s meet again when the sky changes.”

...

After sending Madam Shen and her two daughters off.

Madam Bai was rather satisfied with Shen Rou. Since Madam Shen had already extended an olive branch, she was happy to accept it.

But when it came to marriage, she wasn’t the one to decide.

The most important thing was still Bai Yusheng.

After sending her off, the mother and son returned to their room.

Madam Bai stopped Bai Yusheng, who was about to go upstairs. “Little Five, wait a moment. Mom wants to ask you something.”

Bai Yusheng stopped in his tracks and turned around. He could already guess what Madam Bai wanted to ask.

He smiled and said, “Mom, go on.”

Madam Bai was a straightforward person, and Bai Yusheng had inherited her personality. “What do you think of your Aunt Shen’s eldest daughter? I think she wants to introduce Shen Rou to you. Come to think of it, the two of you are compatible.

“I like Shen Rou. What about you?”

Bai Yusheng was silent for a while. “Mom, you want to hear the truth?”

Madam Bai smiled. “Of course. Don’t lie to me.”

“I don’t have any feelings for her,” Bai Yusheng said coldly. “She’s not my type, so don’t get involved in this. I know you’re anxious to have a daughter-in-law, and I promise you that you’ll have one. Don’t worry about this.

“When I find someone suitable, I’ll definitely bring her home to see you.”

“You don’t like her type?” Madam Bai frowned slightly. “Then, what type do you like? I think that child is pretty good. She’s good-looking and charismatic, and her mannerisms are comforting.”
