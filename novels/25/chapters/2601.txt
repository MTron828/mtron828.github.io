Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Linda didn’t speak for too long.

The call ended a few minutes later.

Qiao Mianmian hung up, a little stunned. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

If Linda hadn’t mentioned it, she wouldn’t have thought about the jewelry.

She didn’t lack accessories, but she didn’t prepare the jewelry for tonight.

But this wasn’t a big deal.

Mo Yesi had given her a lot of jewelry before, and none of them were cheap.

She was about to pick out some jewelry when her cell phone rang again.

It was Mo Yesi.

“Baby, did you receive the dress I gave you? Do you like it?” The man’s low and magnetic voice came from the phone. That alluring “Baby” seemed a whisper by Qiao Mianmian’s ear. Even after hearing it thousands of times, Qiao Mianmian’s heart still trembled.

“Mm.” She couldn’t help but smile. “I got it. It’s beautiful, I like it.”

“As long as you like it.” Mo Yesi’s magnetic voice was full of joy.

“Was this dress very difficult to get?” Qiao Mianmian saw that he had no intention of telling her how precious the dress was and took the initiative to mention it. “I heard from Sister Xie that there are only two pieces in the world. One was given to a princess, and the other was given to me by you. Is this true?”

“Mm, it’s like this.”

It was true.

Although Qiao Mianmian knew that Mo Yesi wouldn’t give her an imitation, she was still a little shocked when he admitted it.

“How did you get this dress? I heard that the designer didn’t even sell it to a princess. Why was he willing to sell it to you?”

Mo Yesi smiled. “Your husband can’t buy what the princess can’t? Baby, are you not confident in your husband’s ability?”

“No, I…”

“Of course, I bought it with my own abilities. The process wasn’t that smooth, but it’s fine as long as the results are good. The most important thing is that you like it. Nothing else is important.”

Qiao Mianmian’s heart pounded again.

“The rarest thing is that you can’t buy this dress. Don’t you think this dress is exactly the same size as yours? So, it’s destined to belong to you.”

Qiao Mianmian had no objections.

This dress was indeed suitable.

It wasn’t custom-made for her, but it was no different from a custom-made one.

Qiao Mianmian touched a small highlighter on the dress. “Isn’t this dress very expensive? How much did you spend?”

Mo Yesi smiled. “It doesn’t matter. It’s too tacky to talk about money. It’s fine as long as you like it.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She didn’t find it tacky.

She was just a vulgar person.

After a while, Mo Yesi said gently, “I’m sorry, there’s something at the company that I have to settle personally. So, I can’t send you to the gala tonight. But I’ll pick you up when it’s over.

“Baby, are you angry with me?”

“Angry? Why should I be angry with you?”

“Didn’t you say that this award ceremony is very important to you? If I have the time, I can be there with you.”

“I won’t be angry with you because of this.. I’m not so petty.”
