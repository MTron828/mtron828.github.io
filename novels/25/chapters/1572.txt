Chapter 1573: Sister, You Have to Help Me

“Qin Han recommending you for such an audition is also a form of affirmation of your capability. If you perform badly and make him feel that you’re terrible, can he recommend you? You’re still young, there will be many opportunities in the future.

“I think it’s good enough that we can do well in the television industry.

“As for the movie industry, it’s good that someone can bring you into it. You don’t have to worry if you can’t. Look at how many people want to enter that industry, but how many people succeeded?”

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but smile. “Sister Xie, don’t worry about me. I’m not upset about this.

“So many seniors came for the audition today, and they’re all outstanding. I really don’t have any advantage over them. It’s expected that I didn’t get chosen.”

Linda looked at her. “You’re not sad?”

“At first, a little, but I quickly figured it out.” Qiao Mianmian said honestly, “I’m definitely disappointed that I wasn’t chosen. But after thinking about my current strength, I can accept this outcome.”

“It’s best that you think that way.” Linda looked at her again and saw that she was really not in a bad mood. She didn’t try to persuade her anymore. “When your drama comes out and accumulates true popularity and fans, your status will naturally slowly increase. Every drama produced by Bai Yusheng is popular. Even if you can’t make it big with this drama, it’s fine to slowly become popular.

“When the time comes, I’ll sign some advertisements and variety shows for you. It’s not impossible to get into the A-list this year.”

Linda wasn’t worried about Qiao Mianmian’s future.

With the powerful backing of the Chairman of the Mo Corporation, was there a need to worry about not making her popular?

Even someone like Qiao Anxin, who wasn’t very capable, could be raised by Su Ze.

It didn’t make sense that Qiao Mianmian was inferior to her.

Linda had already planned Qiao Mianmian’s development this year. Variety shows were very popular now, especially reality shows.

Even some female artistes who didn’t have any works got into the B-list after a few episodes.

Hence, all the major entertainment companies wanted their artistes to appear on variety shows with good ratings to maintain their popularity.

Linda planned to let Qiao Mianmian go on a variety show after filming her drama.

After all, even though Qiao Mianmian wasn’t being criticized by the entire internet, her reputation wasn’t too good.

She could change the netizens’ negative impression of her by appearing on variety shows.

Of course, this was in case the drama didn’t work out.

If Qiao Mianmian became popular with this drama, Linda wouldn’t have to worry about many things. All sorts of good resources would come knocking on her door.

Qiao Mianmian had no objections to Linda’s arrangement. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

After signing as a manager, the only thing she had to do was to act well.

As for the rest, it was naturally left to the professionals. She didn’t have to worry too much.

The Jiang family.

Jiang Luo entered the police station.

Jiang Hai started crying the moment he saw her. “Sister, you have to help me. I don’t want to stay here anymore. Help me out.”

Jiang Luoli looked at him expressionlessly.
