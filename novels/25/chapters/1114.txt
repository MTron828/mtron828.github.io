Chapter 1115: Did CEO Mo Fight For You?

However, no matter how many questions she had, Linda couldn’t answer them immediately.

She reckoned that Linda had no idea what was going on.

It seemed like she could only ask her properly after meeting her.

Soon, Linda sent her the address.

After Qiao Mianmian received the address, she went upstairs to change and got Butler Lin to prepare the car.

...

An hour later.

In a clubhouse’s private room.

The waiter brought Qiao Mianmian to the private room. After knocking on the door, Qiao Mianmian walked in.

Linda was already in the booth. When she entered, Linda waved at her. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

After the waiter closed the door, Qiao Mianmian sat down opposite Linda. As soon as she sat down, she asked impatiently, “Sister Xie, do you know what this advertisement contract is about? You know that with my current reputation, they have no reason to come looking for me.”

Logically speaking, signing such a good thing was something to be happy about.

However, Qiao Mianmian felt uneasy.

She had a feeling that something was amiss.

It was as if a pie had suddenly fallen from the sky.

Therefore, no matter how tempting this advertisement was to her, she did not dare to accept it.

“This is a little strange.” Linda had her doubts too, but she didn’t think much about it and signed the contract.

To her, getting a top endorsement deal like the MC for Qiao Mianmian was definitely a surprise.

After all, even Qiao Anxin, whom she had taken care of in the past, wasn’t strong enough to be a spokesperson for MC.

At that time, Qiao Anxin was already an A-list celebrity.

MC was particularly picky when it came to choosing a spokesperson.

Not only did they have to look at an artist’s reputation and appearance, but they also had to pick the right personality and academic qualifications.

The artists selected by MC were all exceptionally good in all aspects.

And now, Qiao Mianmian...

Apart from her looks and academic qualifications, she seemed to be unqualified in many aspects.

When she received a call from the brands saying that they wanted to sign a new endorsement deal with Qiao Mianmian, Linda was shocked.

Her first reaction was that the other party had called the wrong person.

Otherwise, someone was playing a prank on her.

“But don’t worry, I’ve already asked them clearly. I’ve also looked at the contract. There’s no problem with it, there’s no trap. Also, the other side is quite sincere. They’ve already paid half of the contract fee today.

“They said that after you finish filming the advertisement, they will transfer all the remaining signing fees.

“This time, the one filming the advertisement for you is also a top international director. Mianmian, you’re really lucky. This contract... did CEO Mo get it for you?”

Linda thought about that for a moment and decided it was the most likely possibility.

It wouldn’t be strange if Mo Yesi was the one who got this advertisement.

With his status, it wasn’t a problem for him to give Qiao Mianmian better resources.

Qiao Mianmian frowned. “No way. He didn’t tell me about this?”

Linda looked at her. “I thought you said you wanted to rely on yourself. Maybe that’s why he didn’t tell you.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned for a few seconds, wondering if it was Mo Yesi’s doing.

“Mianmian, I think if CEO Mo was the one who fought for the resources for you, you should take it. It’s not that easy to get an endorsement for MC. You don’t know how many companies are fighting for it. CEO Mo has put in a lot of effort to help you get this resource, so you shouldn’t reject him, right?”
