Chapter 809: A Mysterious Man

“Who knows.” Jiang Luoli shrugged. “Anyway, he didn’t look too good after I accepted the money. But I don’t care how he sees me. We won’t have any interactions in the future, anyway.”

“...”

“I’ve checked, the check is real.” Jiang Luoli rubbed her chin and sighed. “That man is so rich and generous to women. Do you think he’s so generous to every woman he’s slept with?”

“Fifty million yuan for every woman he sleeps with. Do you think he’ll go bankrupt soon?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“Didn’t you say that it was his first time?”

Qiao Mianmian hadn’t known Jiang Luoli for long.

But they knew each other best.

Hence, she could tell that although Jiang Luoli was teasing her, she was still very concerned about what happened last night.

Although she was usually carefree and didn’t seem to care about anything.

But which girl wouldn’t mind her first time?

She didn’t seem to care about the man last night at all.

But she was actually curious.

She wanted to know he was.

Just like how Qiao Mianmian wanted to know who that man was.

It felt terrible to be slept with without knowing who the other party was.

“I guessed it too, who knows if it was.” Jiang Luoli snorted. “But if it wasn’t his first time, his skills are terrible. A man with experience wouldn’t be so bad.

“Do you know, that beast tormented me for the whole night. Besides the pain, I didn’t feel anything else.”

Jiang Luoli said with a look of disdain, “And I seemed to have said that his skills were terrible. In the end, that beast actually tormented me even more. His skills were obviously terrible, but he still had the face to ask if I felt comfortable.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Although she was experienced in this area. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

But hearing Jiang Luoli say it so bluntly, she couldn’t help but blush.

“Baby, let me ask you something.” Jiang Luoli suddenly leaned towards her and lowered her voice. “When you’re with Prince Charming... does it always hurt?”

“Huh?”

Why was she suddenly asking about her?

Qiao Mianmian blushed and bit her lip. “This...”

She wasn’t used to sharing this with her best friend.

“Tell me. I want to know if my experience last night was normal, or if that man was too lousy.”

“Uh, this, it hurts at first, but later...”

“Later?” Jiang Luoli asked curiously.

Qiao Mianmian bit her lip and whispered, “It won’t hurt much after that.”

“Is that so?” Jiang Luoli frowned. “But why do I always feel pain? It seems like that man’s skills are really terrible. No wonder he doesn’t dare to come and see me. I guess he feels too ashamed.”

“Luo Luo, did you... buy the morning-after pill?” Qiao Mianmian suddenly recalled something important.

“What pill?” Jiang Luoli was stunned.

Qiao Mianmian’s expression turned serious. “Morning-after pills. Did you... take contraceptive measures last night?”

Jiang Luoli widened her eyes and looked up at her.

“I don’t think he... took any contraceptive measures.”
