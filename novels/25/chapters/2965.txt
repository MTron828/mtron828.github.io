Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Although she was the daughter of the Bai family and was compatible with the Mo family, she didn’t grow up in the Bai family. She was brought back later.

Hence, she was still different from a real socialite. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

It was difficult for even a proper socialite to enter a family like the Mo family, let alone a “fake daughter” who grew up in a small family.

She was only a rich girl, but she didn’t have the corresponding talent. She was no different from a pretty vase.

But now... not only was she going to hold a wedding, but she was also going to hold a huge wedding.

Just this custom-made wedding dress alone cost 50 million yuan.

The wedding dress was decorated with shiny little diamonds. The lace edges were all interwoven with gold and silver threads. The hemline below the waist was decorated with lifelike three-dimensional flowers. Every flower was handmade. As the flower petals were made of a special material, they would

be ruined if one wasn’t careful. Hence, just sewing the petals together would take most of the day.

‘What more of the flower petals on the skirt.

Moreover, this was only the wedding dress’ price.

The tiara on the headdress was the most expensive one.

The shop assistants didn’t know how much it cost, but they heard that the tiara was made of pure diamonds. It wasn’t even the size of a palm, but it cost the price of a mansion in Yuncheng City.

The wedding dress alone cost 50 million yuan, not to mention the rest.

Normal people wouldn’t dare to think about how much a wedding would cost.

If this wasn’t considered important, what else could it be?

They could never dream of such an “unimportant” event.

“That’s right. Mrs. Mo looks so good in this wedding dress. Mr. Mo will definitely be stunned when we go out later.” Another shop assistant was also amazed and praised her. “As expected, the husband understands his wife the best. Mrs. Mo’s wedding dress is already beautiful, but after Mrs. Mo puts it on, I

feel that this wedding dress is even more beautiful.”

Qiao Mianmian looked at her in shock. “Who did you say designed this wedding dress?”

“Mtr. Mo.” The shop assistant looked at her reaction and found it strange. “Mrs. Mo, don’t you know? This wedding dress was designed by Mr. Mo and Vera’s chief designer. However, the main design was still done by Mr. Mo. Our chief designer added in some ideas.

“Mr, Mo is very talented. Even our chief designer said that he’s very talented in fashion design.”

Qiao Mianmian was shocked.

Mo Yesi designed her wedding dress?

He... hadn’t mentioned this at all.

Did he know how to design wedding dresses?

Qiao Mianmian only knew that he was a jewelry designer. But he actually could also design wedding dresses.

He could design jewelry, wedding dresses, and manage a huge company like the Mo Corporation in an orderly manner. Qiao Mianmian seriously suspected that he had another identity.

Qiao Mianmian changed into her wedding dress. Two of the shop assistants held the dress up and helped her out of the changing room.

Sitting outside the changing room, Mo Yesi was shocked when Qiao Mianmian walked out.

He had imagined what it would look like on her, but even after imagining it a hundred times, a thousand times, it still wasn’t as beautiful as the real thing..
