“Agreed. I’m so envious of them. You can tell that Young Master really loves Young Madam.”

“Young Madam is so beautiful and also has a good personality. Of course, Young Master will be in love with her! Even I am fond of Young Madam.”

“Yes, yes. I like Young Madam too. She has never been boastful to us.”

The maids discussed downstairs.

Upstairs.

As she was walking into the bedroom, Qiao Mianmian received a call from Linda.

She glanced at her phone and picked it up.

Linda asked straightforwardly, “Mianmian, have you thought about it?”

She had already decided to sign the contract.

So, she replied straightforwardly, “Yes. I’ve considered it. Let’s meet somewhere tomorrow to sign the contract.”

Linda was silent for a few seconds, before replying calmly with a hint of joy in her voice, “Sure. Please pick a place to meet. I’ll see you tomorrow.”

“Sure.”

Their conversation was effortless. Qiao Mianmian hung up the phone when the conversation ended.

Mo Yesi stopped, looked at her, and asked, “Who called?”

“Qiao Anxin’s ex-manager, my stepsister.” Qiao Mianmian did not want to hide this from Mo Yesi. Since they were married now, she wanted to discuss this matter with him.

She wanted to listen to his opinion.

She felt that Mo Yesi’s suggestion would never be wrong.

She would feel more at ease if he made decisions for her. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Your stepsister is a manager?” Mo Yesi was puzzled. “Why did she call you?”

Qiao Mianmian pondered for a bit and explained to him about meeting Linda to sign the contract.

After explaining, she asked earnestly, “Do you think I should sign the contract?”

Mo Yesi would never give half-hearted advice to Qiao Mianmian.

He deliberated carefully and gave his opinion. “Yes, you can. I don’t think she can return to Star Splendor given her current situation. Let me take a look at the contract before you sign it.

“If nothing is amiss, you can then sign the contract.

“Did you mention that she’s currently working at Huan Yu?”

“Yes.” Qiao Mianmian nodded. “Huan Yu is one of the biggest agencies in the entertainment industry and has nurtured many artistes. Many famous actors and actresses were from Huan Yu last year. If I sign with them, they should have excellent resources.

“Linda mentioned that she’s friends with the executives of Huan Yu, so there should be no problems with resources. Also, she will groom me with her best resources if I sign under her. Unless she’s lying to me, I would very much like to sign under Huan Yu.”

Everyone in the entertainment industry wanted to be famous.

Including Qiao Mianmian.

She joined the entertainment industry because she loved acting.

However, over time, she might lose her passion if she continued playing small or insignificant roles.

Qiao Mianmian was aware that Mo Yesi did not have much knowledge of the entertainment industry, so she explained it to him in detail.

Mo Yesi listened and nodded. “Her propositions are good, but we cannot be certain about her sincerity until we see the contract details tomorrow. Let me review it before you sign.”

“Yes.” Qiao Mianmian nodded. “I understand, I won’t sign tomorrow. I’ll let you review it first before I finalize my decision.”

“Good girl.” Mo Yesi was especially fond of her cute and obedient manner. He couldn’t resist lifting her chin and leaning in for a kiss.
