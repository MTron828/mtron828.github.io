Chapter 1734: I’ll Avenge You

“Even if there’s nothing between the two of you, with so many rumors, those who don’t know will take it seriously.”

Mo Yesi actually minded it.

He didn’t want Qiao Mianmian to meet Gong Zeli again.

He couldn’t wait for the marriage between the Gong and Shangguan families to be confirmed.

Only by marrying could Gong Zeli get rid of all those inappropriate thoughts.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t retort and nodded obediently.

Anyway, the most important thing now was to coax him.

Seeing how obedient she was, Mo Yesi’s heart softened.

He was indeed furious when he saw the trending topics.

He wasn’t angry with her, but at Gong Zeli’s audacity.

Despite his warning, he was still eyeing his woman.

“In any case, even if you see him in the future, just say hello and leave. Don’t have too much contact with him.”

“Mm, I got it.” Qiao Mianmian nodded obediently. “When I see him in the future, I’ll definitely say hi and leave. I won’t say anything else to him!”

Qiao Mianmian also felt that she should keep a distance from Gong Zeli.

Every time she met him, there would be scandals trending.

The most important thing was what Jiang Luoli said to her today.

Although Qiao Mianmian felt that Gong Zeli wouldn’t fall for her, she wasn’t sure.

He was indeed a little strange today.

No matter the reason he helped her, since Mo Yesi minded their scandals, she had to be careful.

Her relationship with Gong Zeli wasn’t that good anymore.

In the future, they could just be friends.

Mo Yesi finally smiled.

He reached out and rubbed the spot where she’d sprained her ankle. “Does it still hurt?”

Qiao Mianmian shook her head. “It doesn’t hurt anymore.”

Mo Yesi massaged it gently. “I’ll get an explanation from the Shangguan Family. I’ll definitely avenge you.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“No need.” Qiao Mianmian immediately said, “Actually, it’s just that Shangguan Qing has some misunderstanding about me. Moreover, she has learned her lesson. Let’s end this here.”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t know if the Mo and Shangguan families worked together.

But the two families should know each other.

She didn’t want their relationship to be affected because of her.

Shangguan Qing was annoying, but Qiao Mianmian felt that her lesson today was enough.

In any case, she would keep completely away from Gong Zeli in the future. There shouldn’t be any special matters between them.

She and Shangguan Qing wouldn’t have any interactions.

This was the best way to settle this.

“Impossible.” Mo Yesi narrowed his eyes. “No matter who it is, they won’t let my woman off so easily. Don’t bother about this anymore, I know how to handle it.”

Qiao Mianmian wanted to say more, but she swallowed her words when she thought of Mo Yesi’s temper.

Forget it, he could do whatever he wanted.

If the Shangguan and Mo families were working together, they wouldn’t be so easily affected by this.

If the two families weren’t working together and their friendship was ordinary, it wouldn’t affect anything.

Moreover, Qiao Mianmian felt that Mo Yesi needed to seek an explanation from them.

After seeing Mo Yesi, Shangguan Qing couldn’t possibly misunderstand her anymore.
