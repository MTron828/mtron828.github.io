Chapter 99: Be Together with That Homewrecker Forever

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Once again, she felt that Mo Yesi was really attentive to her affairs.

She voluntarily invited her roommates for a meal and the place they ate at was really high-class.

“Babe, I’m really basking in your light.” Jiang Luoli sighed. “Otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to come to this sort of place in my whole life. I was so worried when you found another boyfriend so quickly because it might be too rushed, but now I feel more at ease.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless. “Why do you feel more at ease?”

Jiang Luoli glanced at her. “My male god is handsome, rich, and cares so much about you. It seems that he really likes you. From now on, just be happy with him. As for that scumbag Su Ze, he’s nothing good, so just forget him as soon as possible.”

Jiang Luoli spoke rather scornfully.

Initially, she asked Su Ze for help yesterday and thought that he still had a conscience.

But now...

Ew!

She recalled that thought.

Su Ze was a scumbag through and through!

If her male god had not appeared in time yesterday, she wouldn’t dare to imagine the consequences.

Thinking of this, she angrily took out her phone and sent a text message to Su Ze: [Scumbag, you aren’t worthy of Mianmian. Mianmian is a thousand times better than you and very soon, she will forget about you. You can be together with that homewrecker forever. You’ll regret it one day!]

After that, she added Su Ze’s number to her blacklist.

...

In the box room of the banquet hall.

Su Ze was currently eating with customers.

After receiving the text message, he turned on his phone and his face darkened.

Directly opposite him.

A president from a partnering company who was talking to him about a contract suddenly saw his sullen face and thought that he was dissatisfied with the proposal that was just presented.

“President Su, is there something wrong with the condition I just mentioned? Are you dissatisfied?” His partner’s face was a little upset.

He was already bending backward for him. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

If he continued to give in, he would not make any profits.

If the new president was still dissatisfied, this business would fail no matter what.

When Su Ze looked up, he was met with his partner’s dissatisfied expression and was taken aback slightly. He immediately smiled and said, “You’ve mistaken me, President Zhang. I don’t mean that. I’m not dissatisfied with the condition either.”

Only then did President Zhang’s face soften a little. He raised his wine glasses and said with a smile, “Since you are ok with it, shall we settle it then?”

Su Ze temporarily put aside the annoyance in his heart. He smiled and raised his glass. “Ok, President Zhang. With this glass of wine, I hope that our cooperation will be smooth.”

...

In the box opposite Su Ze.

The waiter took a menu, handed it to Qiao Mianmian, and respectfully said, “Miss Qiao, please place your order.”

Qiao Mianmian looked at Jiang Luoli and Zhang Yuwei. “You two can order first. I will look at it after you.”

Since she was the one treating them, she had to let them order first.

Jiang Luoli did not hold back, took the menu, and smiled. “Ok, we will order first then. Let me see what’s nice here...”

After opening the menu and seeing the price of the dishes, her words came to an abrupt end.

“Seriously!” Jiang Luoli looked frightened as she widened her eyes and immediately closed the menu.

After that, she nudged Qiao Mianmian’s arm and whispered, “Mianmian, the food here is too expensive. It’s so expensive that I’m afraid of ordering anything.”
