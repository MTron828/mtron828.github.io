Chapter 1890: I Will Make Her Pay the Price

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“You’re not money, you can’t make everyone like you.

“It’s because you’re too good that people are jealous of you.”

“Fine.”

Qiao Mianmian accepted this reason.

“Now that you know who it is, have you thought about how to deal with her?”

Without waiting for her reply, Mo Yesi continued, “If you didn’t, leave it to me.”

Qiao Mianmian blinked. “What are you going to do?”

“You can’t have such a dangerous person by your side.” Mo Yesi’s eyes were cold. “If she dares to do this to you, I’ll make her pay the price. You don’t have to worry about this anymore. I’ll get someone to handle it.”

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t a saint, either.

She was not related to Song Ke, but Song Ke had almost ruined her reputation. Although she didn’t succeed in the end, it was impossible for her to not pursue the matter.

She nodded. “Alright, you handle it.”

There was something else he hadn’t told her.

Just now, a police officer interrogated Third Chen about something else.

Mo Yesi hesitated for a while but decided not to tell Qiao Mianmian.

If she knew that Third Chen was instructed by someone to sneak into her room in the middle of the night, she might really doubt her life.

He didn’t want her to be exposed to too much darkness.

He could handle some things himself.

...

Soon, the dishes were served.

Although Qiao Mianmian had been eating well in the production team, her living expenses were limited and she couldn’t eat too well.

This meal was a feast to her.

She ate a lot.

Mo Yesi would only eat a few mouthfuls occasionally just to accompany her. Other times, he would either serve her food or watch her eat.

When Qiao Mianmian came out from work, Zhao Yuan returned the phone to her.

After eating for a while, her phone on the table rang. She picked it up and looked at it. Suddenly, she let out a cry.

“Mo Yesi.”

Before he could ask her what was wrong, she looked up excitedly.

She held his hand and said excitedly, “Luo Luo is pregnant. Mo Yesi, Luo Luo is really pregnant.”

“I’m about to have a nephew.”

Mo Yesi was stunned. “Pregnant? Jiang Luoli is pregnant?” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Yes, yes. Luo Luo sent me a WeChat message just now. She said that she went to the hospital for a checkup and confirmed that she was pregnant. I’m so happy and excited now. It’s a pity that I’m not in Yun Cheng. Otherwise, I could have gone to see Luo Luo immediately.”

“Jiang Luoli is pregnant?” Mo Yesi was shocked. “It’s Big Brother’s child?”

“What are you saying?” Qiao Mianmian glared at him. “Of course it’s Big Brother’s. Who else could it be?”

“I’m not questioning Jiang Luoli. It’s just that this news is too sudden. I’m also very surprised. Does Big Brother know about this?”

Qiao Mianmian nodded. “Yes, he was the one who accompanied Luo Luo to the hospital for a checkup.”

“So what’s his plan now?”

“I haven’t asked her yet. Wait a minute. I’ll ask.”

Qiao Mianmian was just typing when Jiang Luoli sent another message.

After reading it, she couldn’t help but scream in excitement.

“Luo Luo and Big Brother got their marriage certificate. She has really become my sister-in-law now.”

“They’ve already registered their marriage?”

“Yes!”

Mo Yesi wasn’t surprised.
