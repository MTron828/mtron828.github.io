Chapter 2981: Just Buy It for Her

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

“This sea of flowers is too beautiful.

“Wow, there’s actually a castle here, and it’s even a white castle. The castle in the fairy tales I read when I was young was white. I didn’t expect the real white castle to be so beautiful.

“[ think I saw a deer. Am I seeing things?

“Mo Shixiu, Mo Shixiu, look, there’s a group of white horses here. Look at how beautiful they are. Their fur is white and shiny. Can I touch them?

“Mo Shixiu, Mo Shixiu…”

Jiang Luoli was like a little kid entering an amusement park for the first time. She found everything interesting.

Mo Shixiu followed behind her and looked at her jumping around like a child. He reached out and pulled her back. “Slow down, don’t run too fast, or you’ll fall. I didn’t expect you to like this place so much. It seems like I have to bring you out often in the future.”

“This island is really beautiful.” Jiang Luoli turned around, her eyes sparkling as she smiled happily. “I used to think that such a beautiful place would only exist in fairy tales, but it turns out such a place exists in reality.

“My childhood dream was to live in such a place for the rest of my life.”

“Is that so?” Mo Shixiu smiled gently and slowly walked to her side. He reached out and touched her head. “Ah Si has already bought this island, but we can pick a similar one.”

Jiang Luoli was speechless.

Did he mean what she thought?

Mo Shixiu patted her head again and held her hand as they slowly walked forward. “When the time comes, we’ll buy whichever island you like. It’s not realistic to live on the island for the rest of our lives, but we can fly there every year for a period of time as a vacation.”

He sounded as if he was talking about buying an island. Jiang Luoli was stunned.

Even though she knew how rich the Mo family and her husband were, she was still a little surprised by how casual he spoke about buying an island.

“Buy… buy a small island?”

“Mm, don’t you like it?” Mo Shixiu’s eyes were gentle. “Ah Si bought this island because Sister-in-law likes it. If you like it too, I’ll buy you a small island too.”

Jiang Luoli asked, “But isn’t it very expensive?”

This wasn’t a car or a house.

This was a small island.

Mo Shixiu said, “It’s nothing compared to your liking.”

Jiang Luoli was speechless.

Alright, she was elated.

“It’s fine as long as you have this intention.” She smiled and said virtuously, “But I don’t need you to buy me an island. That was my dream when I was little. But my thoughts have changed.

“As long as you and Yueyue are by my side, I can live anywhere.”

Mo Shixiu knew her personality, so he didn’t mention buying her an island again. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He could just buy it and give it to her.

He could tell that she liked it a lot. She said she didn’t need it because she couldn’t bear to spend his money.

Mo Shixiu could understand.

The Jiang family wasn’t very well-to-do, and they valued boys over girls. She’d grown up in such a family, so her finances must be tight. Hence, she’d developed the habit of saving money from a young age.

It wasn’t realistic to change her mind so quickly.

He could only slowly change her spending habits..
