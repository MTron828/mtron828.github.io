Chapter 2678: We’ll Have a Child Soon

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian found it strange.

Because he wasn’t usually like this.

Although Mo Yesi was a man of few words and usually kept quiet, this was how he looked in front of others.

Not in front of her.

Mo Yesi wasn’t so quiet in front of her.

Especially since he hadn’t said a word since he left the hospital. He even looked like he had a lot on his mind. This was a little abnormal.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but ask, “Mo Yesi, is something bothering you?”

Hearing her voice, the handsome man seemed to come back to his senses. He slowly turned to look at her, his deep black eyes questioning. “Bothering me?”

“Yes.” Qiao Mianmian looked at him. “Did something happen? Can you tell me?”

Mo Yesi kept quiet for a few seconds before shaking his head. “It’s nothing.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Nothing?

He looked troubled.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t believe that he was really fine.

She frowned. “You’re lying. You clearly have something on. I realized that you haven’t said a word since you left the hospital. If it wasn’t for something, would you be like this? You’re not like this usually.

“Mo Yesi, you’re hiding something from me. What’s so mysterious that you can’t even tell me?

“I can tell that you’re just in a bad mood.” Qiao Mianmian hugged his waist and leaned against his shoulder. “Tell me, what exactly is it?

“Don’t keep it to yourself. I’m your wife, I can share your burden.”

Mo Yesi’s eyes were filled with warmth.

He thought for a while and sighed softly. Then, he reached out and hugged her. “There’s nothing to worry about. I’m just wondering if our child will be as afraid of me and dislike me as Yueyue does.

“Baby, do I really look that scary? If our own child is afraid of me in the future, how should I interact with him?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She couldn’t help but laugh.

“So, you were worried about this?”

“Mm, I guess.” Mo Yesi nodded.

If his own child didn’t like him and wasn’t close to him, his mood would definitely be terrible.

No, it was terrible.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t expect him to be worried about this. It seemed like scaring their little niece was a huge blow to him.

Although he seemed nonchalant, he actually minded it so much.

Qiao Mianmian found it funny and couldn’t help but chuckle. “Mo Yesi, aren’t you thinking too far ahead? We haven’t even seen the child yet, and you’re already thinking about whether the child will dislike you in the future?”

“It’s not far.” The man looked down at her with a serious expression. “I have a feeling…”

“Mm?” Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “What feeling?”

The man pursed his sexy lips and looked at her deeply.. “We’ll have a child soon.”
