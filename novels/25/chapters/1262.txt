Chapter 1263: Fear of Losing Everything

“Yusheng, you’re back so soon.”

Madam Bai held Qiao Mianmian’s hand and smiled. “Mianmian likes Little Orange very much. I was about to bring her to see it. Since you’re back, I’ll get someone to prepare dinner?”

“No rush.” Bai Yusheng looked at Qiao Mianmian gently and said, “I have something to talk to Ah Si about. It’s not too late to eat later.”

“Alright.”

Madam Bai said, “Then, I’ll take Mianmian to see Little Orange first.”

With that, Madam Bai left with Qiao Mianmian.

“Ah Si, let’s talk in the study room.” Bai Yusheng gave Mo Yesi a look and went upstairs.

Bai Yusheng stopped when he passed by Qiao Anxin.

Qiao Anxin tensed up and swallowed. “Brother.”

“Hmph.”

Bai Yusheng snorted and walked past her.

He didn’t say anything.

But the moment he stopped, Qiao Anxin broke out in a cold sweat.

She felt that he was still suspicious of her.

She realized that Bai Yusheng wasn’t a gullible person. Her seemingly perfect plan didn’t dispel his doubts.

She even felt that he had found something.

This made her panic and feel fear.

She was afraid that the Bai family would know the truth, and even more afraid of losing everything.

She didn’t want to return to her previous life.

What the Bai family could give her now was something the Qiao family couldn’t even dream of giving her.

The Bai family could make her superior.

And when she returned to her previous life, she still had to continue living like a beggar. Even if she was already a top-tier actress, without a strong backing to protect her, she was still a pitiful worm at others’ mercy.

She used to be with Su Ze, and he would protect her.

Hence, she didn’t suffer too much in those two years.

The Su family couldn’t compare to the Mo and Bai families, but it was still influential in their circle.

She had broken up with Su Ze.

If she couldn’t find someone to protect her, she would soon go back to him. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

She didn’t even have the right to reject him.

Hence, she had to hold onto the Bai family.

But...

Qiao Anxin’s expression darkened as she thought about Bai Yusheng and Madam Bai’s attitudes.

They were all nice to Qiao Mianmian.

But towards her...

What did that slut feed them!

“Miss, this is the tea you wanted.”

At this moment, the butler brought the tea over.

Qiao Anxin was embarrassed and in a state of panic. When she saw the butler walk over, she reached out and lifted the teacup.

“Take it away! Everyone’s gone, what’s the point of bringing it over? Who’s it for!”

She flipped the teapot and the teacups.

Even though the butler avoided it quickly, the back of his hand was still scalded.

The housemaids gasped.

Gosh.

This young lady was too bad-tempered.

Uncle Zhao had been in the Bai family for 30 years.

It was said that he had been with the Old Master since he was young. After Old Master and Madam went overseas to live for a few years, Uncle Zhao followed them.
