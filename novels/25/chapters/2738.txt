Chapter 2741: So Rich and Willful

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“We didn’t do it before because I promised you not to publicize our relationship for the time being. Now, we don’t have to hide our relationship from anyone anymore.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned for a while.

Mo Yesi had told her that they would hold their wedding after she was done filming.

She almost forgot something so important.

Although Qiao Mianmian had almost forgotten about the wedding, it didn’t mean that she didn’t value it.

She and Mo Yesi had already confirmed that they were husband and wife, but she was still looking forward to their wedding.

It should be said that every girl looked forward to their wedding. They would imagine what it would be like and what their wedding day would be like.

Qiao Mianmian quickly got back to work.

Linda accepted a skincare product advertisement and a watch advertisement for her. These two brands were top-tier, and their previous spokesperson was also a big-shot celebrity.

Logically speaking, although Qiao Mianmian was very popular and an A-list artiste now, her qualifications were too shallow. These two endorsements wouldn’t land on her so easily.

But she had two other identities besides being an A-list celebrity.

One was the daughter of the Bai family.

The other was the Second Young Madam of the Mo family.

These two brands had previously collaborated with the Bai and Mo Corporations, so when a new spokesperson for the new season was going to be decided, the first person they thought of was Qiao Mianmian.

On one hand, Qiao Mianmian’s current popularity was very high, and her ability to carry goods must be very good. Signing her would increase their sales.

On the other hand, it was also a good way to form a good relationship with the Bai and Mo Corporations to facilitate future cooperation.

Both companies were big shots in Yuncheng City.

Qiao Mianmian told Linda that Mo Yesi would send her to F City.

Linda expressed her envy and jealousy before asking, “Then, should I book an extra first-class ticket? Or are you and Chairman Mo not coming with us? Are the two of you going to F City by yourselves?”

“I haven’t asked him yet. Wait a minute, I’ll ask him.”

Qiao Mianmian sent Mo Yesi a WeChat message asking him about this. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Qiao Mianmian: [Sister Xie just asked me, are we going with them or alone?]

Mo Yesi replied quickly and simply: [Together.]

Qiao Mianmian: [Then, should we book the tickets, or should we get her to?]

Mo Yesi: [No need.]

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Mo Yesi quickly sent another message: [There’s a private plane.]

Qiao Mianmian: [!!!]

Mo Yesi: [What’s wrong?]

Qiao Mianmian: [It’s only two hours, do you need a private plane?]

Wouldn’t it be a waste of money!!

Mo Yesi: [What has it got to do with time? Isn’t it good to take a private plane?]

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Of course, it was good to take a private plane. It was big and spacious, and there was everything inside. The entire time, they enjoyed a five-star treatment.

She flew back from Country Y on a private plane. She didn’t feel uncomfortable at all for the 10-hour flight.

After all, they ate well and rested well.

A moment later.

Qiao Mianmian told Linda about Mo Yesi’s decision.

Linda was silent for a full two minutes. When Qiao Mianmian thought that she had disconnected, she finally sighed and said, “Chairman Mo is really rich.”

…

On the day of the trip.

Linda was sitting in the luxurious private plane, enjoying the steak cooked by the international chef. She took a sip of the red wine that was worth hundreds of thousands of yuan and looked at the fruits and snacks on the table. She couldn’t help but post a photo on Weibo.

Call me Miss Lda: [It’s not like I’ve never sat in a private plane before, but this is the first time I’ve sat in such a luxurious one. I’m on Chairman Mo’s private plane with Young Madam Mo.. At this moment, I just want to say: poverty limits our imagination. People can be very willful with money!]
