“No, I’ll delay everyone’s work if I take too long. I can’t let everyone wait for me alone. Mom, the shoot isn’t long this time. It’ll be done in half a month at most. I’ll be back to see you soon.”

Mother Bai still looked reluctant. She sighed again. “I don’t think you should take your job too seriously. You even told me that you were planning to have a child with Mo Yesi. You’re always out filming television shows and variety shows. How can you have a child like this?

“You should rest more at home.”

“I know, I know.” Qiao Mianmian quickly nodded. “After this shoot, I’ll rest for a while. Mom, are you in a hurry to carry your grandson? Don’t worry, I think you might be able to carry him soon.”

Mother Bai was stunned and immediately looked at her stomach.

“I’m not pregnant.” Qiao Mianmian was afraid that Mother Bai would misunderstand and quickly said, “I mean, maybe Brother’s child will be born before mine.”

“Your brother?” Mother Bai frowned. “Why do you say that? He doesn’t even have a girlfriend now. Isn’t it impossible to have a child?”

Qiao Mianmian asked, “Brother didn’t tell you?”

“What?” Mother Bai was confused.

“Brother has a girlfriend now. And he’s prepared to bring her home this time. He told me that if nothing unexpected happens, she’ll be my future sister-in-law, your future daughter-in-law.”

Mother Bai was shocked.

“W-What did you say?” She stammered. “You said your brother has a girlfriend?”

“Yes.” Qiao Mianmian nodded.

“Is this true?” Mother Bai was still in disbelief. “Mianmian, you’re not lying to me, right? Does your brother really have a girlfriend? And he’s planning to bring her back home?”

“It’s true. Mom, why would I lie to you?” Qiao Mianmian smiled. “Anyway, that’s what Brother told me. He wouldn’t lie to me, right? ”

Madam Bai was stunned for a while before finally believing it. Her face and eyes gradually lit up. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

She seemed to be in a good mood. “Alright, this is a good thing. I’ve been worried about your brother’s marriage for so many years, and this has become a sore spot for me. I’m afraid that the older he gets, the less he wants to get married. If he really brings someone back, we have to treat her well.

“We can’t let others think that our Bai family isn’t easy to get along with and that your dad and I are stuck-ups.”

Mother Bai had been waiting for her daughter-in-law for so many years. Now that she finally had hope, she was excited and happy as if she had encountered a huge joyous occasion.

“Your brother is such a jerk. He didn’t even tell me about such a huge matter. Is he afraid that your dad and I will object?”

Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and said, “Maybe he wants to give you a surprise.”

“It’s indeed a surprise.” Mother Bai was grinning from ear to ear. “I’ve finally gotten what I’ve been looking forward to for so many years. I wonder what your brother’s girlfriend is like.. But your brother has such a picky taste, the girl he likes must be good.”
