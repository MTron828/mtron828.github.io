Chapter 2181: The Bai Family Is Still Better Than The Shen Family

She had just taken over the Shen Corporation and wanted to do well.

Of course, she wouldn’t reject the offer.

Shen Rou raised her glass and was about to clink it with Manager Wang when she heard the women around her say excitedly, “Mo Yesi, Mo Yesi is here.”

“He even brought a companion. Who is that? His girlfriend?”

“His girlfriend is actually so beautiful. I think she’s much prettier than Shen Rou. No wonder Mo Yesi didn’t choose Shen Rou. If it was me, I’d definitely choose someone prettier.”

Shen Rou’s expression darkened when she heard them comparing her to Qiao Mianmian. She bit her lip and looked towards the entrance.

She saw Mo Yesi.

The man’s looks and temperament were outstanding. No matter where he went, he was undoubtedly the center of attention.

The Chamber of Commerce had invited many so-called young talents and rich businessmen.

The people invited were all talented and good-looking.

But they still couldn’t compare to Mo Yesi.

His appearance instantly killed these so-called young talents. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

All the ladies’ eyes were on him.

The two young masters of the Mo family had always been the targets of the socialites in the upper-class society.

Unfortunately, both the First and Second Young Masters were like unreachable flowers in the mountains.

They could see it but not touch it.

No one could pick it.

Hence, it was useless no matter how envious they were.

Now, seeing that the man they wanted to hook up with had another woman by his side and even brought her to the banquet with him, the women present felt a little upset.

But they were happy to see Shen Rou make a fool of herself.

Mo Yesi having a woman wasn’t a blow to them.

After all, they were only interested in him.

But Shen Rou was different.

Everyone knew that she’d liked Mo Yesi for many years.

Mo Yesi chose a female artiste from the entertainment industry over her. She must have suffered a huge blow.

As they didn’t like Shen Rou being in the limelight, Qiao Mianmian’s appearance didn’t attract much hatred.

They also needed someone to suppress Shen Rou.

Hence, even though these women actually didn’t like Qiao Mianmian, they still praised her. “I also heard that Mo Yesi’s girlfriend has a rather good family background. She’s not inferior to Young Lady Shen at all.”

“Oh? Isn’t she just a female artiste from the entertainment industry? What other background could she have?”

“You rarely read gossip news, right? She’s not just a newbie in the entertainment industry. You know the Bai family, right? Mo Yesi’s girlfriend is their daughter. In terms of family background, she’s not inferior to Young Lady Shen at all.”

“The Bai family is still better than the Shen family.”

“The daughter of the Bai family? But doesn’t the Bai family only have one son? How could…”

“She was separated from them when she was young. The Bai family has been looking for her for years, and now they’ve finally found her.”

“If she’s really the daughter of the Bai family, her qualifications are much better than Shen Rou’s. It seems like Mo Yesi really knows how to pick a girlfriend.”
