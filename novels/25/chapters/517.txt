Chapter 519: Whose Daughter Is She!

“You have to marry Su Ze and become Young Madam Su.”

“Dad.” Qiao Anxin looked at him palely. “Su Ze caused my miscarriage, he caused you to lose your grandchild. Does it not matter to you?”

Of course, Qiao Anxin knew that she couldn’t break up with Su Ze.

Before she found a better candidate, she wasn’t going to let go of him.

Few other men in Yuncheng City were more eligible than Su Ze.

The Yan family, Gong family, Mo family, Shen family—these few families were richer and more powerful than the Su family.

But she knew where she stood.

The heirs of these families were of different status. She might not be able to get them, even if she wanted to.

And even if she managed to be on good terms with them, it was impossible to marry into their family.

Given the Qiao family’s current situation, and given who she was, it was already a blessing that she managed to have Su Ze.

Although she was already a top-tier actress, she didn’t have enough good works yet. Her acting was also subpar, and she could be dropped from the top tier anytime.

Marrying into the Su family was her best bet for a good future.

As for the other families like the Gong’s and the Yan’s, there was no way they would allow a celebrity to enter the family.

Celebrities were seen as glamorous figures in the eyes of the commoners.

But to these truly rich and powerful people, they were no better than the poor performers of the past.

These families were extremely conscious of their image.

How could they possibly allow a descendant to marry such a performer?

That was why Qiao Anxin targeted Su Ze back then. She didn’t bother challenging herself with impossible tasks.

She really was smart.

But even though she was already determined to cling onto Su Ze for the sake of her career and future, it still hurt her to hear something like this from her biological father.

“If Qiao Mianmian was in my place today, would you have said the same?” Qiao Anxin felt a strong surge of disgust as she mentioned that name. “I heard all that you and Mom said. What exactly is Qiao Mianmian’s background? Whose daughter is she? Dad, Mom said she was the daughter of your master. Does that mean that she’s actually a rich Miss?

“You’re so nice to her even though she isn’t your biological daughter. Is it because of her actual background?

“Dad, tell me, whose daughter is she!”

Previously, Qiao Anxin only knew that Qiao Mianmian and Qiao Chen were adopted from the orphanage.

She had despised Qiao Mianmian since the beginning.

And never entertained the possibility that Qiao Mianmian’s biological parents were renowned figures.

How was it possible? Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Most children put in orphanages came from poor families that couldn’t afford to raise them.

Otherwise, they were handicapped children.

The rich families could afford to raise as many children as they wanted. Why would they put their own flesh and blood in an orphanage?

But she heard what Father Qiao and Lin Huizhen said when she woke up.

Based on what Lin Huizhen was saying, Father Qiao seemed to know Qiao Mianmian’s true identity.

But wasn’t Qiao Mianmian from the orphanage?

How would Father Qiao know her biological parents?

She was already inferior to Qiao Mianmian in every aspect. The only aspect in which she could feel better about herself was in her background compared to Qiao Mianmian’s.
