Chapter 811: I Want Her, She’s My Woman

Mo Shixiu’s expression darkened as soon as Assistant Xu finished speaking. “I know what happened best. It was my fault for touching her first. Last night... she was a victim. I won’t allow you to be so rude to her again.”

“But Sir Minister, she...”

“Assistant Xu, I don’t want to repeat the same words again.” Mo Shixiu lowered his voice. “No matter what, if I take her, she’ll be my woman. Try being rude to my woman again.”

Assistant Xu was shocked and kept quiet.

Oh no.

Judging from the minister’s reaction, could it be that he had taken a liking to the girl from last night?

Alright, he had to admit that the woman was good-looking and had a good figure.

Her looks were considered top-notch.

But so what if she was beautiful?

With his boss’ status, did he still need beautiful women?

Hence, the minister must not be so protective of her because of her looks.

Just because... he slept with her?

Assistant Xu felt that this was more likely.

After all, his Minister was almost 30 years old and was still a virgin.

Hence, he must have a deep impression of the woman who took his virginity and gave him his first time.

Although men didn’t value their first time as much as women, their first time had a different meaning to them.

They often had a deeper impression of women who they first slept with.

No matter how impressive his Minister was, he was still a normal man.

So...

But Assistant Xu felt bad for him.

Why was he thinking about such a materialistic woman?

“I gave her that money willingly, and she deserved it. Under normal circumstances, I should be responsible for taking her virginity, but... so that money can be considered compensation for her.

“No matter what, she should be able to lead a good life.”

“You’re right, Minister.” Assistant Xu dared not express his dissatisfaction.

The minister had already said that she was his woman.

Was he courting death by going against the minister’s woman?

Mo Shixiu looked down and recalled the scene from last night.

His heartbeat, which had always been steady, accelerated again.

He was drugged last night, but that didn’t mean he couldn’t remember anything.

In fact, he remembered many things clearly.

For the first time in his life, he felt that it wasn’t a good thing to have a good memory.

The consequence of remembering what happened last night was that he couldn’t focus on his work for the whole day.

That woman’s shadow would always appear in his mind.

It disturbed his thoughts and made him unable to work normally.

This was something he’d never encountered before.

He didn’t know what to do. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Minister, I know you have a special impression of that woman. I also believe that she had nothing to do with you being drugged last night. But just to be safe, I think we should investigate her.

“Firstly, after we get to the bottom of it, if what happened last night had nothing to do with her, it’d be best. If it has something to do with her, we can start from her and find out the mastermind.”
