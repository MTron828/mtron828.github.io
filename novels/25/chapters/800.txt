Chapter 802: Shen Rou, You’re Trying to Ruin Her

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Ah Si, I...”

“So, this is the reason you set her up behind her back?” Mo Yesi’s voice got colder.

Shen Rou widened her eyes in shock and panic. Her hand trembled, and she almost dropped the bowl.

“Ah Si, w-what are you talking about?” She looked away guiltily, not daring to meet his eyes.

Impossible.

How did he know?

He couldn’t know.

He wasn’t talking about that. Was he testing her?

Shen Rou panicked for a few seconds and forced herself to calm down.

Mo Yesi sneered. “You know very well what I’m talking about. Do you know why I’m willing to see you today? Shen Rou, even if you don’t like her, I won’t force you to. This is your freedom. But since you’re tempted by her, I can’t just sit back and do nothing.”

“Ah Si, I-I didn’t do anything.”

Shen Rou wasn’t sure if Mo Yesi was testing her or if he really found something.

She hid the panic in her eyes and pretended to be confused. “Ah Si, what are you talking about? I don’t understand. I have no feud with Mianmian. I admit that I don’t like her, but I don’t hate her.

“What reason do I have to touch her?

“Are you suspecting me because of her scandal? Do you think I got someone to do it? Ah Si, you’re being unfair to me.”

“Unfair to you?”

Mo Yesi seemed to have heard a joke. He narrowed his eyes and said sternly, “You think I’ve wronged you? Do you think I’ll suspect you just because I haven’t checked anything?

“You got the company to spread rumors about her and frame her as a third party. You know that she’s an artiste and that public opinion affects her a lot, but you still did this.

“Shen Rou, you’re trying to ruin her.

“You’ve gone overboard with my wife. Do you think I won’t do anything about it? Do you think I’d meet you if I didn’t have concrete evidence?”

Shen Rou’s expression cracked.

She panicked. “Ah Si, I-I didn’t do it.”

“The IP address that we found is from the Shen family. Who else could it be besides you?” Mo Yesi’s gaze was extremely cold. “I warned you previously not to have any ill intentions towards her. Otherwise, no matter who you are, I won’t be nice to you.

“It seems like you didn’t take my warning seriously. Instead, you’re getting worse.

“Do you really think I won’t do anything to you?”

Shen Rou’s expression changed. She couldn’t help but feel a sense of fear as she looked into his cold eyes.

It was precisely because she’d known Mo Yesi for so many years.

Hence, she knew what he was capable of.

He was a ruthless person who treated people he didn’t care about with extreme coldness and heartlessness.

She was sure that he wouldn’t do anything to her because of their years of friendship.

Even though he was married to another woman, she still felt that she had a place in his heart.

It was precisely because she was sure that she was special to him that she dared to lay her hands on Qiao Mianmian.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
