Chapter 2708: A Lunatic

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The rest of them couldn’t sit still and quickly left the room.

Everyone was afraid of Gong Zeli’s anger.

After all, everyone knew that he had once beaten his classmate into a vegetable.

And his illness…

It was said that it had never been cured.

Hence, his illness could act up at any moment.

But no one wanted to be beaten into a vegetative state by him. In less than a minute, the group of playboys left the private room.

Only the person in the washroom didn’t know what was happening outside.

In the washroom, the two of them were in a heated argument.

It was only when Gong Zeli kicked the door open that the person inside heard the commotion and stopped.

“Which bastard…” The dissatisfied man was fuming with anger after being interrupted. But the woman in his arms exclaimed,” Y-Young Master Gong…”

“What, Young Master Gong?”

The man was stunned and turned around. Seeing Gong Zeli standing at the door of the washroom with a dark expression and a murderous look, his face turned pale. He immediately reached for his pants and stuttered, “Y-Young Master Gong, why are you…”

Gong Zeli didn’t say a word. He stepped forward and kicked the man, sending him to the ground.

The woman beside him screamed.

“Scram!” Gong Zeli’s eyes were full of disgust. “All of you, get lost.”

No one knew why he suddenly lost his temper.

He seemed to be in a good mood previously.

But now, no one had the time to think about this. The man who was kicked to the ground was so frightened that he didn’t even have time to put on his pants. He picked himself up from the ground and stumbled out of the washroom.

Not fully dressed, the woman held her chest and stumbled out.

This Young Master Gong was indeed a lunatic!

One after another!

If he wasn’t born in the Gong family, if he wasn’t the only heir, if he didn’t have a good-looking face, which woman would like his temperamental and volatile temper!

The room fell silent.

Everyone was gone, leaving Gong Zeli alone.

He stood in the private room for a while before turning around and walking out slowly.

…

Cars sped on the streets.

The night was the most prosperous place in the city center. Even though it was late at night, it was still a bustling scene.

Gong Zeli was escorted out of the door.

“Young Master Gong, take care. Be careful of the steps.” The people behind him were respectful as they carefully sent this God of Fortune off.

Gong Zeli didn’t have a good reputation in Yuncheng City.

Everyone knew that he had a bad temper and was easily angered. He wasn’t someone to be trifled with. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

But because of his status, many people fawned over him.

He was a VIP customer of the night establishments.

The amount of money spent in one night was enough to feed most people.

The employees here were naturally very respectful towards this God of Fortune.

The valet had already driven his sports car over. He bent down and jogged to him, handing him the car keys respectfully.. “Young Master Gong, your car keys.”
