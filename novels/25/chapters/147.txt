Chapter 150: They’re Too Overbearing!

The Su family had a media and entertainment company with quite a number of artistes under their management. They’d also managed to groom a few of them to stardom.

Qiao Anxin was signed under the Su family’s company.

Su Ze would rather groom Qiao Anxin than Qiao Mianmian.

That was because he cared for Qiao Mianmian too much. After marrying her, he wouldn’t want her to have such a career where everyone would see her so much.

And yet, he somehow came to feel something for Qiao Anxin.

Now, Su Ze had officially taken over the family business. Qiao Anxin was also doing very well in her career. This adulterous pair was having their way at everything... Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

It was so frustrating to think of that.

Qiao Mianmian was better than Qiao Anxin in so many ways. If someone would groom her, she’d outdo Qiao Anxin easily.

Qiao Mianmian pursed her lips and kept quiet for a while.

She’d thought about what Jiang Luoli said before.

In fact, she’d even given it serious consideration.

She actually had no idea whether Mo Yesi was in favor of her being in the entertainment industry.

But... it seemed like he’d never objected to it before.

Of course she knew that if he was her backing, she wouldn’t have to worry about the potential problems.

The Mo family was not to be trifled with by anyone.

Mo Yesi definitely had the ability to protect her and safeguard her interests.

While in deep thought, her cell phone rang again.

She saw that it was a call from the Qiao family, and her expression darkened slightly. “Hello.”

“First Miss,” Nanny Chen said in a panicked voice. “Come back, quick!”

Qiao Mianmian was immediately alerted. “What happened?”

“Today... Today, Second Miss said that Madam’s room seems nice. It has natural light and it’s by the garden, so there’s lots of fresh air. She wants to move into Madam’s room.”

“What?!”

Qiao Mianmian’s expression turned a little awful. “She wants to move into Mom’s room? Dream on! Does Dad know about this, what did he say?”

Nanny Chen was crying over the phone. “Master was against it initially. But Second Miss said that she’s pregnant now, and the fortune master told her that the room she’s in now isn’t good for her baby. She has to move into Madam’s room in order to have the child safely.

“Moreover, Young Master Su keeps speaking for Second Miss, how could Master offend him? So he... agreed.

“Second Miss is getting someone to pack her belongings now, she wants to move in today. First Miss, come back quickly. That’s Madam’s room! Master had promised Madam and you that he’d keep the room intact after she passed. Besides First Miss, no one should be allowed to move into that room.

“Second Miss and Madam Zhen know about this. They’re doing it deliberately.”

Qiao Mianmian’s expression got even darker.

When she hung up, she looked terrible.

She was so angry, she almost hurled her cell phone at the wall.

They were too overbearing!

Qiao Anxin took Su Ze away. But she resigned to it since that scum wasn’t worth her being hung up over him!

But Qiao Mianmian would not allow her to take over her mother’s room!

“Mianmian, what’s wrong?” Jiang Luoli asked right away when she saw her expression.

“Nothing.” Qiao Mianmian clenched her fist and sneered. “Luo Luo, I’m going home for a while. I need to settle something. If I’m not back by the time the afternoon classes start, help me apply for leave.”
