Chapter 1462: Worried About My Baby

“But given her current situation, even if I don’t interfere, it’ll be hard for her to clear her name.”

Qiao Mianmian knew that it was impossible for Qiao Anxin to return to her previous position.

Even if Mo Yesi lifted her ban, others would still be wary of the Mo Corporation and wouldn’t dare to cooperate with Qiao Anxin.

Moreover, she got Qiao Chen to expose Qiao Anxin’s infidelity photos. Qiao Anxin’s image was ruined, and it was hard to recover.

“Mm, you just have to stay out of it. I can’t control the rest.”

...

Qiao Mianmian never expected Mo Yesi to come.

Because he said that he would be very busy in the next few days. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Previously, he took the time to come over. It was already a lot of time. When he returned to Yuncheng City, he had to work overtime for a few days to make up for it.

Even when she returned to Yuncheng City previously, he was too busy with work to pick her up at the airport. It was obvious how busy he was.

Hence, when she was about to leave after eating with Bai Yusheng, the door was pushed open. Qiao Mianmian was shocked when she saw a familiar figure walk in.

Her first reaction was that she’d seen wrongly.

She rubbed her eyes and looked up. When she still saw the man in front of her, she was sure that it wasn’t her illusion.

She blinked and asked, “Mo Yesi, why are you here?”

“So soon? You rushed to the airport the moment you received my WeChat message?” Bai Yusheng was stunned when he saw Mo Yesi. He then teased. “It seems like Mianmian is really your precious. With a brother-in-law who pampers my sister so much, there’s nothing to worry about.

“Then, I won’t be your third wheel. I’ll leave you two alone.”

With that, Bai Yusheng got up, buttoned his shirt, took his wallet, and left the room.

He closed the door after leaving.

Only Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi were left in the room.

Qiao Mianmian was still in a daze.

She only snapped out of her daze when Mo Yesi reached out and pulled her into his arms.

She looked up at the man’s handsome face and murmured, “Why are you here? Aren’t you at work? Aren’t you very busy recently?”

“Mm, I was very busy at work.”

Mo Yesi lowered his head and looked at the girl in his arms. “But I still wanted to come and see you. Otherwise, I wouldn’t feel at ease.”

Qiao Mianmian’s heart trembled. She couldn’t help but ask, “What are you worried about?”

“I’m worried about my baby.” Mo Yesi frowned and looked at her reddened eyes. His slender fingers touched the corner of her eyes. He felt pity and anger at the thought of her crying until her eyes were swollen.

Qiao Ruhai was an old fool.

How could he hurt the baby he loved so much?

If he didn’t know that Qiao Mianmian had feelings for him and cared about him, Mo Yesi would have taught him a lesson.

Qiao Mianmian was warmed by his answer.

She never thought that Mo Yesi would especially fly to F City to look for her because of this.
