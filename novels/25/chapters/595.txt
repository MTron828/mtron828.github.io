Chapter 597: Did You Meet Su Ze Today?

“Mo Yesi, I can do it myself...”

“So you’re not tired?” Mo Yesi raised his brows as his deep gaze matched her delicate lips.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

...

Finishing her lunch, Qiao Mianmian was very tired and fell asleep quickly.

It was 6 pm when she woke up.

She rubbed her eyes and yawned. Just as she was getting out of bed, she received a call from Jiang Luoli.

Once she picked it up, Jiang Luoli fumingly said, “Damn, Baby, have you checked Weibo? There are bad rumors about you again.”

Qiao Mianmian was confused.

She was slightly out of it as she had just woken up. She slowly replied, “I haven’t checked Weibo. What happened?”

Jiang Luoli raged. Clenching her teeth, she said, “Did you meet Su Ze today?”

Qiao Mianmian was startled and unconsciously frowned. “Yes.”

Now, she felt repulsed each time she heard his name.

“Then, that’s right.” Jiang Luoli raged. “Someone is spreading rumors about you being the third party that ruined his relationship with Qiao Anxin. Also, someone posted a video of Su Ze proposing to you on the street.

“They say that since Su Ze and Qiao Anxin have not officially separated, you being the third party is revolting.”

“The netizens are against you. Even though some are defending you, it’s practically useless. It seems that the negative comments are written by bots. Looking at the numbers, they must have bought many of them.

“Some famous celebrities even reposted the news and are criticizing you. These celebrities must have been paid to do it. Since you aren’t famous, why would they bother to spread the news?

“Also, they started to attack without anyone stepping forward to clarify the situation. Isn’t it strange? Do you think Qiao Anxin bought the bots to write the negative comments after seeing the news?”

Hearing the rumor of her being a third party in Su Ze’s relationship, Qiao Mianmian started feeling unwell.

She frowned. “I got it. I’ll check Weibo now.”

“Go, go.” Jiang Luoli was boiling with anger. “That shameless Qiao Anxin. I really want to punch her. She ruined your relationship and still has the audacity to spread rumors about you being the third party. How can she be so shameless? UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“How can there be such a shameless woman. If she appears in front of me now, I’ll definitely give her a good beating. Also Su Ze, that jerk, what was he thinking? Isn’t he still dating Qiao Anxin? Why did he...

“Could it be that he regrets breaking up with you?

“Damn, Baby. You can’t be soft-hearted and reconcile with him.

“Prince Charming is so much better than him. You can’t...” Jiang Luoli was anxious.

“Luo Luo, don’t worry,” Qiao Mianmian replied before she was done talking. “I will never ever reconcile with him. You know what my personality is like, how can I possibly reconcile with him.”
