Shen Rou’s eyes turned fierce. “We won’t be sisters anymore!”

Shen Xin looked at her in shock.

Shen Rou sounded so determined.

Even Madam Shen and Father Shen’s expressions changed.

“Rourou, what are you saying…” Madam Shen didn’t want her two daughters to be in a bad relationship. If they really got into a fight, she didn’t know which side to help.

“What do you mean by not being sisters anymore? You both came out from my womb. This blood relationship won’t change no matter what. Be it you or Xiao Xin, you’ll always be my daughter.

“We’re family, let’s talk about it. Don’t say such hurtful words.”

“That’s right.” Father Shen, who had been silent all this while, also said disapprovingly, “What do you mean you’re no longer sisters? I don’t like to hear these words. Don’t say them anymore. Xiao Xin, your sister was too angry, that’s why she said that. What happened to that Weibo post, did someone ask you to do that?”

Shen Xin pursed her lips and shook her head.

“No, no one asked me to do that. It was my own idea.”

Madam Shen saw Shen Rou’s gloomy expression and hurriedly tugged on her younger daughter’s sleeve. She advised her nicely. “Xiao Xin, quickly make another post. Don’t anger your sister anymore. Do you know how much impact your post had on your sister?

“Even the Shen Corporation was affected. Have you forgotten how the outsiders treated us when our family was down? I don’t want to experience such a life again. Dad and Mom have doted on you since you were young. Take it that you’re helping us, alright?

“Family have to help each other. Your sister is in trouble now, how can you leave her in the lurch?”

“Xiao Xin.” Father Shen looked at Shen Xin seriously and sighed heavily. “Only you can help your sister. If your sister’s matter can’t be resolved, the Shen Corporation will be greatly affected.

“Our Shen family can’t afford another blow.

“Be good and stop being willful. You’re helping your sister and our family, do you understand?”

Shen Rou kept quiet.

As long as Shen Xin agreed, she would have a chance to clear her name.

Shen Xin looked at Madam Shen and Father Shen, who were looking at her expectantly.

She knew that what they said was true.

The Shen family couldn’t take any more blows.

If Shen Rou’s negative news wasn’t resolved, it would have a huge impact on the Shen Corporation.

She had already heard that the Shen Corporation’s stock price was affected by this incident.

If she was sensible and filial enough, she should have agreed.

“Xiao Xin.” Madam Shen waited for a while and couldn’t help but call her. “Why aren’t you saying anything? Are you still unwilling? Xiao Xin, you’re the daughter of the Shen family. If our family is in trouble, you won’t be fine too. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“What are you hesitating for?

“Is it really as your sister said, that your family isn’t as important as an outsider?” Madam Shen was getting angry.

At this point, if her daughter was still insensible and disobedient, she would feel that she had raised her for nothing.
