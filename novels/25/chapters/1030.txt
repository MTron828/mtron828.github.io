Chapter 1032: Chairman Mo Is Doing This for Your Good

“He’ll be happy to help you out.”

Qiao Mianmian was confused.

“Mianmian, do you know that your boyfriend called Chairman Zhao? He revealed his identity to Chairman Zhao, so not only will Chairman Zhao not terminate the contract with you, but he will also give you a lot of resources to choose from. You should understand what I mean now.

“Mianmian, why didn’t you tell me that your boyfriend is the Chairman of the Mo Corporation? You told me that he owed a small business, and I actually thought it was true. Actually, I should have thought of it long ago. How could he own a small business?

“His aura doesn’t seem like it.

“But no matter how I guessed, I never expected him to be so powerful.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “Sister Xie, you said my boyfriend called Chairman Zhao?”

“Mm.”

“He even revealed his true identity?”

“Mm.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“But why didn’t he tell me about this?” If she hadn’t heard it from Linda, Qiao Mianmian wouldn’t have known about this.

No wonder she suddenly said she wasn’t going to terminate the contract.

So, it was because of Mo Yesi.

Chairman Zhao wanted to terminate the contract with her because he felt that she had caused a lot of trouble for the company.

He didn’t want her to get into trouble again.

Now that he knew that her boyfriend was the Chairman of the Mo Corporation, why would he be afraid of trouble?

Her boyfriend was Mo Yesi.

He could even settle a huge problem for her.

And once he terminated the contract with her, it was equivalent to offending Mo Yesi indirectly.

Offend the Chairman of the Mo Corporation?

How many people dared to do that?

Although Huan Yu was the leader in the entertainment industry, they weren’t even comparable to the Mo Corporation.

“Did you ask him to keep your relationship a secret?” Linda asked.

Qiao Mianmian nodded.

Linda smiled. “It might be because you said that you wouldn’t publicize your relationship, for the time being, so he hid this from you. But Chairman Mo is doing this for your own good. The company will only value you if he reveals his identity to Chairman Zhao.”

Qiao Mianmian kept quiet.

“Mianmian.” Linda thought highly of her and didn’t want her to leave Huan Yu. She hesitated for a while before trying to persuade her. “The company will definitely put you in an important position now. You’ll be able to develop well if you stay in Huan Yu. I hope you can stay, and we can achieve good results together.

“I know that with Chairman Mo’s help, you won’t have to worry about resources after leaving Huan Yu. But I’m guessing that you don’t really want to rely on him to get popular, right? If that’s what you thought from the start, you wouldn’t have hidden his identity.

“And you wouldn’t take on a third female lead role.

“You still want to make a name for yourself, right?”

Linda was good at reading her mind.

She guessed what Qiao Mianmian was thinking.

She didn’t want to rely on Mo Yesi.

She wanted to see how far she could go by herself.

But now that Mo Yesi had already made his identity clear to Zhao Kai, Linda said that the company would definitely value her in the future. Wasn’t she also depending on Mo Yesi?

Seeing her hesitation, Linda continued to coax her. “Actually, if you stay in the company, the resources that the company gives you in the future won’t be counted as Chairman Mo’s. There’s no lack of artistes with strong backing in the entertainment industry, but it doesn’t mean that you can become popular just because of good resources.”
