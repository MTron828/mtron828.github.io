Chapter 472: Seeing Her as No More Than a Materialistic Woman

“It’s fine.” Jiang Luoli squinted at him. “I don’t mind.”

Yan Shaoqing was speechless.

Was this woman so eager?

Was she trying to keep him after knowing his background?

Yan Shaoqing’s impression of Jiang Luoli immediately became bad.

Many women were after his money, but this was the first who made it so obvious.

He actually couldn’t tell that such a sweet and innocent girl like Sis-in-law actually had such a materialistic and scheming best friend.

This wouldn’t do.

He had to remind his Sis-in-law and get her to stay away from her.

Such a materialistic woman would lead her astray.

“Alright, then.” Yan Shaoqing despised Jiang Luoli now but had to put on a front. “As long as you don’t mind it.”

“So, shall we?” Jiang Luoli raised her brow and looked as if she couldn’t wait to have him to herself.

Yan Shaoqing felt disgusted.

He regretted it.

He should have apologized to his Sis-in-law and admitted his mistake, rather than confess to a random woman just because he was afraid that Second Bro would hit him.

“Ahem, I can’t wait to go on a date with you too. But it’s not nice leaving Sis-in-law behind on her own, right?” Yan Shaoqing was still trying to get out of it.

“It’s fine.” Jiang Luoli smiled and put her arm around Qiao Mianmian. She blinked at her several times and said, “Baby, we’re going on a date now. You’ll be fine alone, right?”

“Luo Luo, you...” Qiao Mianmian couldn’t tell what Jiang Luoli was trying to do.

Given her understanding of Jiang Luoli, she couldn’t really have fallen for Yan Shaoqing.

And Yan Shaoqing was obviously acting.

What was going on with these two people?

“Since you’re fine, we’ll get going then.” Jiang Luoli stuffed the roses back into Yan Shaoqing’s arms and walked off first. At the door, she turned around and said, “Young Master Yan, hurry up.”

She purposely sounded as coquettish as she could, and Yan Shaoqing actually got goosebumps from her voice.

He almost lost his balance and slipped.

...

Outside the clubhouse.

Yan Shaoqing was about to get his car when he heard the woman beside him call out. “Uh, Mr. Yan, please hold on.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

She sounded normal now and a lot less detestable.

Yan Shaoqing turned around. He didn’t like her, but he was still rather nice to her because she was Qiao Mianmian’s best friend. “Is anything the matter, Miss Jiang?”

Jiang Luoli smiled and began twirling the ends of her hair.

In Yan Shaoqing’s eyes, she was purposely trying to seduce him.

He sneered inside.

Ha, was she trying to act cute and innocent just like that?

Did she not know that he had way more experience in flirting than she did?

Did she think he was so easily won over?

What a joke!

Jiang Luoli knew that a lot was going on in his mind. He was already seeing her as no more than a materialistic woman.

She stuck her hand out and said smilingly, “Mr. Yan, can I borrow your cell phone? I just need to send a message.”

Yan Shaoqing was taken aback. “Borrow my phone?”

“Mm, can I?”

Yan Shaoqing looked at her for a few seconds and then slowly smiled. His eyes said that he’d seen through her.
