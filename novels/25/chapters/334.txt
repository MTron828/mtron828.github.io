Chapter 335: Baby, Do You Want to Help Me Out?

As he kissed her, passion began to surge from inside him.

How did she manage to be this way?

She was soft all over.

Those slender fingers were fair and tender, and he didn’t want to let go of them.

He wished he could devour her whole.

“Mo Yesi, I’m sleepy...”

Qiao Mianmian could feel her fingers go warm. Everywhere he’d kissed seemed to have been warmed.

The man’s breath against her palm burned with an intensity that shocked her.

She looked up and met his gaze, glowing and passionate. She quickly retracted her hands and curled under the blanket.

She wasn’t unfamiliar with the look in his eyes.

It seemed like something was going to happen if he continued kissing her.

But she wasn’t so afraid. After all, she was still on her period. He couldn’t possibly do anything to her.

But he’d definitely be feeling discomfort now.

And if he was uncomfortable, he might make her use her hand again...

Qiao Mianmian could already feel the ache in her hand as she recalled the last time.

Mo Yesi took a few deep breaths, but his breathing was still a little hurried. It took him a while of sitting in silence and will of suppression before that initial surge ebbed off.

When he looked up again, Qiao Mianmian could see beads of perspiration on his forehead.

“Go to sleep,” he said hoarsely. “I’ll leave when you’ve fallen asleep.”

Qiao Mianmian pulled the blanket a little higher and then took a quick glance at that part of him. She immediately blushed and asked quietly, “A-Are you feeling very uncomfortable right now?”

It was already bulging.

Pretty high up...

Mo Yesi had actually caught her glancing at it.

He smiled teasingly. When he spoke again, his voice was even lower. “Mm, it’s very uncomfortable. Baby, do you want to help me out?”

Qiao Mianmian immediately pulled the blanket over her head and said, pouting, “I’m so sleepy, I’m falling asleep...”

Seeing how embarrassed she was, the man chuckled.

The wave of fiery passion was still present. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

As he looked at the outline of her figure beneath the blanket, he got even warmer inside.

Hide as you wish.

It will just be a few more days.

Then, I’ll get all I want out of you.

When the time comes, it will be no use regardless of how much you beg me.

Mo Yesi waited till Qiao Mianmian fell asleep before he left.

The afternoon appointment was at a golf course.

When he arrived, the Director of Heng Tong Firm came forward to welcome him.

The door of the black Rolls-Royce opened, and a charismatic young man emerged.

Everyone’s attention was directed to him the moment he got off.

“Director Chen, this is Chairman Mo.”

Wei Zheng introduced him to the older man before them.

The older man sized Mo Yesi up for a few seconds and then gave a diplomatic and respectful smile. He put his hand out. “So this is the newly appointed chairman of the Mo Corporation. I didn’t expect you to be such a young man. You’ve got potential.”

“Chairman Mo, thank you for giving us the honor of seeing you in person, and for giving Heng Tong a chance of collaborating with you.”

The Director of Heng Tong who was doing the talking was a 50-odd-year-old man. He’d achieved great results in the business world after working all his life, and his current status was rather extraordinary.

No matter where he went, others were always reverent towards him.

But this time, it was him showing such respect towards someone else.

And to a man who was 30 years his junior, no less.

Initially, he hadn’t thought much of this young Chairman who’d returned from overseas not too long ago.
