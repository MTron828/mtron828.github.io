Chapter 947: Name a Price, How Much Do You Want?

A minute later, Hottest Ethnic Trend replied: [Hello, you are?]

Shen Rou saw that this person had replied to her and immediately replied: [You said that Tu Yilei’s withdrawal from the industry for a year has something to do with the female lead. What exactly is going on?]

Another minute later, Hottest Ethnic Trend replied: [I’m sorry, I can’t tell you what exactly happened. You don’t have to reply to me anymore. If you still want to ask about this, you won’t be able to get anything out of me.]

Shen Rou’s expression darkened as she read his reply.

“Rourou, do you still want to play?” Shen Rou was the one who invited the other daughters of rich families to play with her. Seeing that she was holding her cell phone and not saying anything, one of them couldn’t help but ask.

Shen Rou’s thoughts were all on the comment.

She wanted to know what Tu Yilei’s retirement had to do with Qiao Mianmian.

She had a feeling that the truth was disadvantageous to her.

The person she hated the most now was Qiao Mianmian.

She’d never hated anyone so much.

Anything that could make Qiao Mianmian suffer would make her feel better.

The more unfortunate Qiao Mianmian was, the happier she was.

That slut had better die suddenly.

This would make her even happier.

She hated that slut.

“I’m not playing anymore.” Shen Rou took out a card from her bag and called the waiter to pay for the bill. Then, she stood up with her bag under the other ladies’ unhappy gazes. “I have something on, I have to go first. I’ll come out to play another day.”

With that, she turned around and left, not caring what the others thought.

“Pfft, what’s going on. She called us out to play, but she left in less than an hour.”

“It’s not like it’s the first time you’ve met her. She’s always been so casual.”

“Who asked her to be Young Lady Shen? With her status, would you dare to say it in front of her?”

“Do you guys feel that Shen Rou has been in a bad mood recently? Who offended her?”

“Who else could it be? She must have gotten herself into trouble with Second Young Master Mo again. What do you think she’s thinking? She’s had a crush on him for over 20 years, and he hasn’t accepted her yet, but she’s still able to persevere. She’s the daughter of a rich family, she’s so good in all aspects, there’s no need to be so humble. Could it be that Second Young Master Mo is like a god, that’s why she’s so obsessed? Have any of you seen Second Young Master Mo?”

“I’ve seen him once...”

“You’ve seen him before? How is he? Does he really look like a god?”

“Mm, he’s really good-looking. He’s like a god. Anyway, you’ll know when you see him. I promise you’ll never forget this man.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Is he that good?”

“Let’s put it this way, all the men I’ve seen since I was a child can’t even compare to half of his looks. If I were Shen Rou, with such an outstanding man by my side since I was a child, I wouldn’t be attracted to other men too.”

...

Shen Rou walked out of the bar. The valet drove her car over and handed her the car keys respectfully.

She took it from him and opened the private chat with Hottest Ethnic Trend.

She looked at their conversation and thought for a while before replying: [Name me a price, how much do you want?]
