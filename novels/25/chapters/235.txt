Chapter 237: Mom, You Don’t Have to Make Things Sound So Awful

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Only then did Su Ze react.

He looked up, saw the fire in Qiao Anxin’s eyes, and hurriedly added, “Mom, I don’t mean that. What I mean is that, even though she and I have broken up, our families can still have the marriage contract.”

Mother Su was confused. “How?”

Su Ze hesitated for a while. “Back then, the marriage contract stipulated that if the Qiao family had a daughter, I would marry her. Mom, Anxin is also the daughter of the Qiao family.”

Mother Su was taken aback.

A few seconds later, her eyes widened in shock.

She stood up with a look of disbelief and pointed towards Su Ze and Qiao Anxin as her voice quivered. “Y-You both...”

It was obvious now. Su Ze did not want to hide their relationship anymore.

He held Qiao Anxin’s hand and stood up. “Mom. Anxin and I are already together.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Qiao Anxin pursed her lips and leaned towards Su Ze like a girl in need of support. She looked sincere as she said, “Aunt, Brother Ah Ze and I are truly in love with each other. Please give us your blessings.”

Right after she said that she saw a teacup soaring towards her.

She quickly ducked into Su Ze’s arms and called out, “Brother Ah Ze.”

Su Ze saw it too.

He held Qiao Anxin and quickly evaded it.

A sharp sound rang out.

The ceramic teacup was shattered on the ground.

Some of the hot tea splashed onto Qiao Anxin’s leg.

“In your dreams!”

Mother Su was enraged and shaking from the anger. “You shameless woman. Mianmian is your biological sister, and you actually took her man from her! How can you be so disgusting!

“So Mianmian broke up with Ah Ze because of you!

“Why did you seduce my son of all men? He was about to marry Mianmian already. Don’t you feel any guilt at all doing this?”

Mother Su never would’ve expected this to be the reason Qiao Mianmian and Su Ze broke up.

Her son was actually involved with the second daughter of the Qiao family.

Mother Su felt as if she’d been slapped on the face.

She’d actually thought of bringing Su Ze and Qiao Mianmian back together.

She really liked Qiao Mianmian and wanted her to be the daughter-in-law of the Su family.

But...

After finding out about this, Mother Su was clear that it was impossible now.

She knew Qiao Mianmian well.

That girl was gentle and mild-tempered and seemed easygoing.

But deep down, she wasn’t fragile or easy to convince.

If it concerned her principles, she would never compromise.

At this point, Mother Su felt disappointment, anger, and pity.

She never thought that the son she’d been so proud of would do something so unforgivable!

It was already overboard that he cheated. It was unimaginable that the other party was the second daughter of their family.

Qiao Anxin’s expression had turned awful from all the scolding as she held Su Ze tightly.

She clenched her teeth in anger, but when she looked up again, her pitiful front had replaced it. “Brother Ah Ze,” she called out sadly.

Su Ze looked down at her pitiful expression and immediately felt bad for her.

He held her tighter and tried to defend her. “Mom, you don’t have to make things sound so awful.”
