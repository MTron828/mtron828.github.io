Chapter 56: Qiao Mianmian, How Dare You Hit Me!

In the backseats.

The handsome man watched her walk away slowly and smirked slightly.

“Master, are you going to the company now?”

“Yes, let’s go.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

As soon as Qiao Mianmian walked into the dormitory building, she received a call from her friend Jiang Luoli.

“Mianmian, why aren’t you in school yet? Come back quickly.”

“I’m already downstairs in the dormitory. What’s wrong?”

“Shen Yueyue said she can’t sleep on the top bunk and wants to change her bed with you. She’s throwing your things on the ground.”

What?!

As soon as Qiao Mianmian heard this, she felt angry.

She hung up the phone and ran upstairs.

The bedroom was on the third floor and she ran up all the way. She pushed open the door of the concealed room, walked in, and saw Shen Yueyue picking up her quilt and dropping it to the ground.

It wasn’t just her quilt.

Many things on her bed had been thrown onto the ground.

“What are you doing, you can’t do this! Who are you to throw Mianmian’s belongings?”

Jiang Luoli was trying to stop her but to no avail. Shen Yueyue impatiently shoved her away and said angrily, “Make way. What does it have to do with you if I throw Qiao Mianmian’s belongings? Do you think it’s any good to curry favor with her now? She has already broken up with Young Master Su and doesn’t have a mountain to rely on anymore, so she’s absolutely nothing now.”

As she talked, she threw other belongings of Qiao Mianmian’s onto the ground.

Seeing this scene, Qiao Mianmian was so angry that she clenched her fists.

At this time, someone noticed her, hesitated, and pulled Shen Yueyue’s sleeve. “Yueyue, Qiao Mianmian is back.”

Shen Yueyue didn’t panic at all and turned around calmly.

When she saw Qiao Mianmian, a contemptuous smile appeared on the corner of her lips. “Qiao Mianmian, you’re back. Then I will tell you now, I want your bed. You move to the upper bunk.”

Qiao Mianmian looked at the clothes, quilt, and various books that had been thrown all over the place.

She lifted her head, her face steely, her voice so cold it was like a frozen layer of ice. “Were you the one who threw all my things onto the ground?”

“Yeah.” Shen Yueyue folded her arms and raised her chin, looking down on her. She said arrogantly, “Who told you to come back so late? I could only help you move your stuff down.

“Now that you are back, you have to move the rest yourself.”

As soon as she said this, a slap landed on her face.

Immediately, her face twisted to the side and swelled immediately.

“Ah!”

The girl standing beside Shen Yueyue shrieked when Qiao Mianmian slapped Shen Yueyue. She pointed at her and yelled, “Qiao Mianmian, who are you to slap her!”

Shen Yueyue was stunned by this slap.

It took her a few seconds to return to her senses.

“Qiao Mianmian, how dare you hit me!” Shen Yueyue covered her face in disbelief.

Qiao Mianmian looked at her coldly. “You deserve this slap. If you dare to touch the things on my bed again, I will slap you again!”

The two of them had always been deadly opponents.

The two had a good relationship once, but when a boy that Shen Yueyue liked publicly pursued Qiao Mianmian, her good girlfriend became her enemy.

But in the past, Shen Yueyue would never dare to do such a thing no matter how much she hated her and was unhappy with her.

Now, she must have found out that she and Su Ze had broken up.

She felt like she had no backing anymore, so she had decided to take her old revenge.

Shen Yueyue covered her face, her expression sinister. She gritted her teeth and said, “I used to tolerate everything about you because you were dating Young Master Su. But now that you have broken up with him, do you think I’ll still be afraid of you?”
