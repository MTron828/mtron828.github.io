Chapter 850: Secretly Photographed

The man’s cold eyes warmed up. After a few seconds of silence, he nodded. “Alright.”

Qiao Mianmian heaved a sigh of relief.

She let go of his arm and held his hand instead. “Let’s go, then.”

Su Ze lay motionless on the ground as if he had fainted.

But the moment Qiao Mianmian held Mo Yesi’s hand and turned to leave, his body suddenly moved and his lips opened. He said weakly, “Mianmian, don’t go...”

Mo Yesi’s suppressed temper flared up again. He grabbed Qiao Mianmian’s hand and turned around with a cold smile. “Su Ze, if you want to die, I can fulfill your wish right now.”

“Mo Yesi, let’s go.”

Qiao Mianmian was afraid that he would get angry again.

Su Ze’s eyes were unfocused.

He glanced at Mo Yesi and then at Qiao Mianmian. “I-I’ll always be waiting for you. Mianmian, I... I won’t give up just like that.”

“Up to you.”

Qiao Mianmian quickly dragged Mo Yesi and dragged him away.

The moment they turned around, a few people holding cell phones quickly turned around and left.

Qiao Mianmian turned around and saw the few of them leaving hurriedly. She frowned and had a bad feeling. “Mo Yesi, did someone secretly take photos of us?”

It was normal for someone to take photos secretly.

They weren’t in a secret place.

This place was always crowded.

She hadn’t noticed it before, but now she was worried. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

If someone really took a picture of her, wouldn’t that mean that a photo of Mo Yesi was also taken?

The more she thought about it, the more worried she got. “What if someone really took a picture? You just...”

Mo Yesi saw them leave too.

He guessed that someone must have captured it.

Compared to Qiao Mianmian’s worry and panic, he was very calm and composed. “So what?”

Since he dared to do it, he knew that he would be photographed.

This was a restaurant, not a private clubhouse.

“But, you just...”

“Don’t worry.” Mo Yesi patted the back of her hand and comforted her gently. “If there’s news, I’ll get the company’s public relations to suppress it immediately. Moreover, I’m the one who did it. Even if there’s any negative impact, it won’t affect you.

“When the time comes, I’ll take all the responsibility.”

“Won’t this affect you negatively?” Qiao Mianmian was still worried.

“I’m not in the entertainment industry,” Mo Yesi said nonchalantly. “I don’t care what others think of me. Alright, don’t worry about this anymore. I’ll be fine as long as I say so.”

“Alright.”

Qiao Mianmian felt like she was worrying too much.

He was the Chairman of the Mo Corporation. He was rich and powerful. There was nothing he couldn’t settle.

He’d quickly suppressed the rumors she’d created.

She wasn’t so worried anymore.

...

The two of them left the restaurant.

Qiao Mianmian had to fly back to F City early the next morning, so she had to rest early.

After washing up, she went to bed to rest.

Mo Yesi also knew that she was going to wake up early, so he didn’t disturb her that night. They spent the night as a Buddhist couple, hugging each other and resting early.

The next day, Qiao Mianmian woke up at 5 am.
