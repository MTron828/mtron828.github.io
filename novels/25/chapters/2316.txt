Chapter 2319: Not as Good-Looking as Her

“What?!”

Before Mo Yesi could say anything, Yan Shaoqing was shocked. “Brother Mo quit this year’s election? Lu Rao, where did you hear that? It’s scary.”

“Don’t you know?” Lu Rao’s expression was calm. “I thought you knew. Many people in the industry have already received the news.”

Yan Shaoqing looked at Mo Yesi in shock. “Second Bro, is this true?”

This matter was almost public.

But it hadn’t been announced to the public yet, so only some people in the industry knew.

Hence, Mo Yesi wouldn’t hide it.

He nodded. “It’s true.”

“Damn.” Yan Shaoqing was shocked. “Second Bro, what’s going on with Big Brother Mo? Didn’t we already say that he’s the president of this year? Why did he suddenly drop out?”

Lu Rao also looked at Mo Yesi.

He was curious too.

When he first found out about this matter, he was just as shocked as Yan Shaoqing.

After all, if nothing went wrong, Mo Shixiu would be the next president.

This matter was almost certain.

But why did Mo Shixiu suddenly give up?

“I’m not sure.” Mo Yesi didn’t answer their curiosity. “But Big Brother always has his own reasons for doing things. Since he decided to back out, it means that this is a better choice for him.”

“That’s the President’s position.” Yan Shaoqing found it unbelievable. “How many people would be willing to give up that position? Could it be that… Brother Mo was threatened?”

Mo Yesi rolled his eyes. “Who do you think can threaten the Mo family?”

Yan Shaoqing was speechless.

That was true.

The Mo family had always been the one threatening others.

He couldn’t think of anyone who could threaten the Mo family and even make Mo Shixiu give up the election.

But why would he give up?

Qiao Mianmian returned to the private room after taking a picture with the fan.

The fan was elated. She found Lin Wanwan and walked over excitedly.

“Wanwan, it was the right decision to come today.” The fan showed Lin Wanwan the photos of her and Qiao Mianmian. “Sister Mianmian is really too nice. She took so many photos with me. And she took every photo with her cell phone. But even though she was standing in front, her face was still so small and beautiful.

“She’s really beautiful. So beautiful that she looks like a fairy in every photo. She’s the first person I’ve seen who looks better in person. How could there be such a beautiful lady? I think even the school belle in our school isn’t half as good-looking as her.

“She and the big brother who came in with her are really a match made in heaven.”

The fan was still excited and couldn’t stop talking.

Lin Wanwan’s expression darkened.

The fan talked for a while, but Lin Wanwan didn’t respond. Thus, she looked up curiously.

Seeing how unhappy Lin Wanwan looked, she was stunned. “Wanwan, w-what’s wrong? Who offended you?”
