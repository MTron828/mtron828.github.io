Chapter 628 - I Will Always Be by Your Side and Not Let You Feel Lonely

“I’m not aggrieved.” Qiao Mianmian lifted her head to look at the man wiping her tears and Old Madam with a worried expression. Her whole heart was full of warmth.

Touched, she said, “I feel blissful. Grandma, you treat me as well as my own grandmother does. I cried because I was thinking of her.”

Old Madam hired someone to look into Qiao Mianmian after Mo Yesi first brought her to the Mo Residence.

Although she trusted her own judgment, marriage was a very important thing, so she still hired someone to investigate her background.

Hence, she knew that Qiao Mianmian’s grandmother had passed a long time ago.

Her mother had also passed a while back.

She pitied this weeping girl who started crying when she thought of her own grandmother.

Old Madam stroked her head and said gently, “Good girl, so you were thinking about your grandmother. Don’t cry anymore. Your grandmother must be doing well now in heaven. From now on, Grandma will be here for you.”

Mo Yesi did not expect her to cry because of this.

He knew that Qiao Mianmian’s grandmother and mother passed early. His wife did not lead an easy life thus far. He hugged Qiao Mianmian and coaxed her. “Baby, don’t cry. Although Grandmother has left, there are still people around you who love you.

“You will always be blissful from now on.

“I will always be by your side and not let you feel lonely.”

Seeing the couple being so lovey-dovey, Old Madam smiled.

The single, workaholic Mo Shixiu felt slightly uncomfortable seeing his younger brother and sister-in-law act like this.

He didn’t know what he was uncomfortable about.

It was uncomfortable to watch.

His younger brother was never someone with such a temperament.

He would never give a second look to any beautiful woman.

Not to mention being so lovey-dovey.

But now…

Hearing how his younger brother was coaxing his sister-in-law, Mo Shixiu felt extremely uncomfortable.

If he didn’t witness this scene himself, he would never believe it. It was fascinating to see his younger brother, who never cared about women before, treat his wife this way.

Is love really so powerful?

Can it cause someone to change so much?

He didn’t want to date or experience love as he felt that it was burdensome.

And also boring.

He wouldn’t waste his time on meaningless things.

“Shixiu, are you jealous?”

While Mo Shixiu was thinking, he suddenly heard Old Madam call him. He instinctively turned to look at Old Madam. “Grandma.”

Old Madam looked at her outstanding eldest grandson. Although he was perfect in many ways, he was still single. She said anxiously, “If you’re envious of your younger brother, quickly bring back a sweet granddaughter-in-law for Grandma to see.

“Once both of you settle your marriages, Grandma will have nothing else to worry about.”

Mo Shixiu was speechless.

Avoiding the topic, he said, “Grandma, I have something on. I will head to the study for a while.”

Old Madam wanted to talk to him about marriage again.

Mo Shixiu felt upset and helpless regarding this.
