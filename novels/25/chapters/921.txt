Chapter 922: Feed You First

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Baby, I’m hungry too,” said the man as he looked at her deeply.

Qiao Mianmian felt threatened. “I’m really hungry, I’m so hungry, can we eat first...”

She just wanted to use that method to coax him. She didn’t think about how crazy this man would get every time she called him Hubby.

The man’s eyes were burning, and his breath was getting warmer. Even her chest was getting warmer. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The arm around her waist was giving off steam.

Qiao Mianmian knew very well what it meant for men to change.

Every time Mo Yesi looked at her like that, she would be unable to get out of bed.

She was afraid of his gaze now.

Thankfully, this time, Mo Yesi didn’t want her so badly. Qiao Mianmian heard him take a deep breath and looked up to see his expression.

Beads of sweat were forming on his forehead.

They slid down his forehead.

The man was obviously aroused, but he controlling himself. Qiao Mianmian found him extremely sexy and charming.

It was an indescribable temptation.

Especially when beads of sweat rolled down his face and across his well-defined facial features. It was a unique temptation.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but gulp.

She had to admit that this man before her, who had already become her husband, was really the best of the best.

Even she was tempted by him.

If she didn’t know how strong he was in that aspect and how scary it was to be tormented by him, Qiao Mianmian wouldn’t mind sleeping with him.

And this was the first time she thought he wasn’t good enough.

She even tried to console him, afraid that he would lose confidence and feel inferior.

In the end...

She couldn’t do it again.

Every time after that... she would cry.

As a result, even though she sometimes coveted his beauty, she only dared to think about it in her heart and didn’t dare to let him know.

If he found out...

She probably wouldn’t be able to get out of bed for three days.

“Alright, let’s eat first.” Mo Yesi hugged her tightly, his chest heaving up and down. After taking a few deep breaths, he gradually suppressed the restlessness in his body and spoke with a hoarse voice.

After he calmed down, he let go of Qiao Mianmian and said hoarsely, “Baby, I’ll feed you first.”

Qiao Mianmian blushed and looked at him fearfully. “Mo Yesi, I have to go to the hospital tomorrow morning.”

“So?” Mo Yesi raised an eyebrow.

Qiao Mianmian said, “... I have to sleep early tonight.”

“Mm, I do have to sleep early,” said the man considerately, nodding.

Qiao Mianmian thought that he’d given up on the idea and heaved a sigh of relief. “You have to wake up early tomorrow too, right? Then, let’s quickly eat and rest early.”

Mo Yesi looked down and nodded. “Alright.”
