Chapter 2867: Won’t Let Her Be

Most of the netizens were also fence-sitters.

Seeing so many people supporting Qiao Mianmian, they felt that Jiang Xinyue’s words were probably just rumor-mongering.

After all, she said that her contract was terminated because of Qiao Mianmian.

She definitely hated Qiao Mianmian.

Hence, it wasn’t impossible to spread rumors about her.

Because Mo Yesi said that the Mo Corporation’s legal team was ready, no one reposted Jiang Xinyue’s interview. Even the few bold people who weren’t afraid of death immediately deleted their posts and comments after Mo Yesi’s statement.

As a result, Jiang Xinyue’s post didn’t cause much of a stir.

It was like a storm on a sunny day.

…

“Mianmian, the public opinion on Weibo is on your side now. Qiao Anxin wants to take the opportunity to ruin your reputation. Her wishful thinking has come to nothing. It’ll be difficult for her to stir up any more trouble.

“But even though this matter has been resolved, I don’t think she’ll let it go. Have you thought of taking this opportunity to expose her true identity?”

Qiao Mianmian had just exited Weibo when she saw the WeChat message Linda sent her.

After reading it, she thought for a few seconds and replied: [I have this intention, but to expose her true identity, I need to find some evidence.]

After replying to Linda, Qiao Mianmian sent a message to Bai Yusheng and Qiao Chen respectively.

She asked them to help her gather evidence that Qiao Anxin and Jiang Xinyue were the same person.

Back then, Qiao Anxin and Su Ze’s intimate photos were all gathered by Qiao Chen.

He could use the same method to get evidence of the plastic surgery against Jiang Xinyue.

Although his methods weren’t very brilliant, against someone like Qiao Anxin, there was no need to be clever.

Qiao Anxin’s actions this time had really angered Qiao Mianmian.

Hence, she felt that there was no need to give Qiao Anxin a way out.

Since she was courting death, so be it.

Qiao Chen and Bai Yusheng replied quickly.

Qiao Chen: [No problem, leave this to me. Hmph, Qiao Anxin actually dared to come back. She’s back, but she doesn’t know how to behave. She even dares to do this behind our backs. See if I don’t skin her alive.]

Bai Yusheng: [It’s not a big problem. Just give me an hour.]

Qiao Mianmian didn’t bother about it anymore after reading their replies.

She just had to wait for them to hand the evidence to her.

At this point, Qiao Mianmian felt that having reliable brothers was too easy.

…

On the other side.

Not long after Qiao Anxin’s interview was posted on Weibo, she received a call from Su Ze.

His angry voice could be heard.

“Qiao Anxin, are you crazy! Do you know what you’re doing!

“I don’t care if you’re crazy, but don’t make me suffer with you!”

Su Ze was practically screaming.

Qiao Anxin heard his piercing voice and frowned as she put her cell phone away from her ear. After a while, she placed it against her ear again and said coldly, “I’m not crazy. I know what I’m doing.

“That slut Qiao Mianmian left me nothing. Why should I tolerate this? Why should I watch as that slut continues living happily!”
