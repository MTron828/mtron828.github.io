Chapter 2475: Untitled

Qiao Mianmian hung up after talking to Linda.

Then, she opened Weibo and saw what Linda was talking about.

Under the influence of the new Internet Water Army, she and Mo Yesi might not break up at first, but not long after, it became inevitable that they would break up. In fact, they had already broken up, but because of some circumstances, they hadn’t made it public yet.

What was even funnier was that someone actually said that Mo Yesi was already with Shen Rou.

Some netizens actually believed that Mo Yesi and Shen Rou were the most compatible couple. Breaking up with her was a wise decision.

They even said that if it wasn’t for her interference, Mo Yesi would have been with Shen Rou.

Qiao Mianmian seemed to have become a third party. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She found it funny.

She didn’t intend to bother about it because she didn’t think it was important.

But she didn’t expect that the person behind this to get more and more overboard.

She didn’t want to bother about her, but she didn’t want to let her off.

Qiao Mianmian called Mo Yesi in a fit of anger.

“Mm, you don’t have to bother about those trending topics. I’ll leave it to the public relations department to handle it. They’ll settle it soon.”

“What do you tell the public relations department to do?”

“Remove the trending topics. Those who deserve it will be sued.” Mo Yesi said simply, “As for the mastermind, I’ll get someone to find out. In the future, such rumors won’t appear anymore.”

Qiao Mianmian kept quiet for a while.

“What’s wrong, Baby?” Mo Yesi saw that she didn’t say anything and asked in concern, “You don’t think this is enough? If you don’t think the punishment is enough, then…”

“No, the punishment is enough.” Qiao Mianmian looked up and met his dark eyes. She was silent for a few seconds before saying, “But even if we remove the trending topics, many people might still believe the rumors.

“In some people’s eyes, removing the trending topics is equivalent to admitting guilt.

“They’ll believe the rumors even more.”

Mo Yesi was stunned. He thought about what she’d just said and frowned. “Then, what do you think we should do? I’m going to make a post on Weibo to clarify things.”

Qiao Mianmian bit her lip and thought for a while. “I’m going to reply on Weibo too. Have you thought of what to post?”

“Not yet.” Mo Yesi shook his head. “I want to discuss it with you. Send what you think is best.”

“Then, send the marriage certificate,” Qiao Mianmian said.

Mo Yesi was shocked. “Marriage certificate?”

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian met his gaze and said calmly, “The marriage certificate. Didn’t they say that we’d definitely break up? This kind of rumor will break itself if we show our marriage certificate. There won’t be such rumors in the future.”

This was what Qiao Mianmian decided after much consideration.

She had already decided on this before she called Mo Yesi into the lounge.

Anyway, she and Mo Yesi were completely publicized now.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t announce her marriage before because she wanted to wait until the wedding was over.
