Chapter 1335: She Came Over Behind My Back

“What, you’re here? It’s so hot, why aren’t you at home?

“Where are you now? Alright, I got it. I’ll look for you right away.

“Alright, I got it. I’ll bring her along.”

A moment later, Bai Yusheng hung up.

He said helplessly, “Mianmian, Mom is here.”

“Aunt is here?” Qiao Mianmian was shocked.

“Mm, she said she was worried about you and had to come over personally. She’s going to be on set soon.” Bai Yusheng had a headache. “She told me about this yesterday. She said that you were alone and had no one to take care of you. She was worried and wanted to come with me to take care of you

“I really didn’t expect her to come all the way here without telling me.

“Mianmian, I know there are some things you can’t accept. But Mom has been looking for you all these years. Every time she talks about you, she’ll blame herself and feel guilty. She said that if she finds you one day, she’ll definitely make it up to you. So, I hope you can understand her actions.

“She can’t control herself. She loved you too much and felt sorry for you, so she...”

“Brother Bai, I understand.” Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and said, “Then, I’ll go with you to see Aunt.”

Madam Bai flew to City F.

No matter what, she had to meet her. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Moreover, she wasn’t against Madam Bai. She just didn’t know how to face her.

...

Bai Yusheng had a lounge.

Madam Bai was taken to the lounge when she arrived.

Bai Yusheng brought Qiao Mianmian over. Just as they entered, Madam Bai saw Qiao Mianmian and immediately got up from the sofa.

“Mianmian.” It hadn’t been long since they last met, but Madam Bai acted as if they hadn’t seen each other for a long time. She grabbed Qiao Mianmian’s hand excitedly and looked at her with tears in her eyes.

“Mom, what are you doing?” Bai Yusheng saw the tears in Madam Bai’s eyes and asked in confusion. “Didn’t I bring Mianmian here? Why are you crying?”

“I just want to cry.”

Madam Bai glared at him and whined like a little girl. “I had a dream last night. I dreamed that Mianmian was taken away and hidden. I searched everywhere, but I couldn’t find her.

“That dream was too realistic. I was so afraid that Mianmian would really be snatched away. It wasn’t easy for us to find Mianmian. If she’s hidden again, where are we going to find her?”

Bai Yusheng was speechless.

His mother was too worried about her.

He walked over and placed his hand on Madam Bai’s shoulder. “Mom, it was just a dream. Your dream is the opposite. So Mianmian can’t be snatched away. Moreover, who dares to snatch her from our Bai family?”

Madam Bai still had tears in her eyes as she stared at Qiao Mianmian. “I don’t care. Anyway, I want to stay by Mianmian’s side and take care of her. She’s filming here alone, and there’s no one to take care of her food and lodging. How can I be at ease?”

Bai Yusheng was speechless.

“Mom, do you want to stay here for a long time? Don’t joke with me.”

“Who’s joking with you.” Madam Bai glared at him again and grabbed Qiao Mianmian’s hand. “Mianmian is already so skinny. Life on set is so tough, I have to nourish her well.”
