Chapter 1878: Is That Qiao Mianmian’s Boyfriend?

He felt like he had just eaten a delicious scallion pancake. “Sister Mianmian, you’re too awesome. Why do I feel like you know how to do everything? It’s so blissful to be in the same group as you. There’s always good food to eat.”

Qiao Mianmian picked up a few scallion pancakes from the pot and placed them on a plate. “I made more. If you’re hungry, you can have some first.”

“What about you?” Zhan Bo took it over and didn’t stand on ceremony as he reached out to take a piece.

“I still have a few dishes to prepare. You guys can leave first. I’ll call you when I’m done.”

Qiao Mianmian had just finished speaking when a staff member walked into the kitchen. When he saw her, he immediately said, “Miss Qiao, your family is looking for you. He’s waiting for you in your room and wants you to go back immediately.”

Qiao Mianmian looked at the staff member doubtfully. “My family came to look for me? Are you sure you didn’t inform the wrong person?”

“I’m sure,” the staff said with certainty.

Could it be that Qiao Chen was looking for her?

Or did Bai Yusheng or Mother Bai come looking for her?

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t with her phone, so she guessed that it could only be the three of them.

And Mother Bai was the most likely one.

Because she had told Mother Bai where she was going before she came over.

At that time, Mother Bai’s heart ached so much that she didn’t want her to participate in the show.

Qiao Mianmian thought about it and nodded. “Alright, I’ll be right there. But I haven’t cooked for the students yet, this place...”

“We’ve already arranged for someone to prepare this meal. Miss Qiao, don’t worry.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

Would the program team be so kind?

They found someone to help her complete her mission?

Although she was a little puzzled, she still nodded. “Alright. Then, I’ll be troubling you.”

After speaking, she turned to Zhan Bo and the others. “I need to leave for a period of time. Zhan Bo, I’ll leave the position of team leader to you for the time being. You’ll handle the rest.”

Zhan Bo nodded. “Mm, quickly go see your family.”

Everyone was envious of Qiao Mianmian’s family visiting her.

She left after giving her instructions.

...

At the same time.

The quiet courtyard became much livelier with the new arrival.

“Is that Qiao Mianmian’s boyfriend?” Song Ke, Qiao Anxin, and the rest looked at the closed door. They were still in a daze.

They never knew that such a man existed in real life.

That face was as handsome as a god.

He was like a high and mighty god, making people feel that he was beyond reach.

Song Ke was in the entertainment industry, so she naturally had no lack of good-looking men around her.

However, the men she knew and interacted with in the industry were not even a tenth of that man. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

It wasn’t just the difference in appearance, but also the temperament and elegance.

One look at that man and one could tell that he was very prominent and distinguished.

Song Ke knew that Qiao Mianmian had a boyfriend, but she never expected him to be so young and handsome.

Qiao Anxin turned to look at her. Seeing her infatuated expression, she said unhappily, “Yeah.”

Qiao Anxin liked Mo Yesi.

Naturally, she didn’t like seeing other women fall for him.

“Qiao Mianmian is actually so lucky.” Song Ke’s tone was full of envy and jealousy. “She actually found a handsome and rich boyfriend. But I don’t think this man is sincere towards her. Maybe he’s just playing with her because she’s pretty.”
