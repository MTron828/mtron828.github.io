Chapter 941: Mo Yesi, That Hooligan!

He was her husband.

He was the closest person to her.

But if he wanted to know about her, he had to get it from someone else.

He was the last to know about the things that even the people around her didn’t know about.

Mo Yesi was still a little angry at the thought of this.

Qiao Mianmian knew that she’d made a mistake in this matter, so her attitude was very good. She nodded obediently and said, “Mm, I promise you. In the future, no matter what happens, I’ll tell you immediately.”

Mo Yesi raised an eyebrow. “Can you keep your word?”

“Yes!”

“What if you can’t do it?”

“Then... then, you’ll punish me?”

“Punish you?” The man’s gaze landed on the red marks on her neck. He paused for a few seconds and smiled meaningfully. “Alright. If I find out that you didn’t do it, I’ll punish you. By then, it won’t matter how you cry or beg me.”

Qiao Mianmian immediately understood what he meant.

She also knew what his so-called punishment was.

She blushed.

Mo Yesi was such a hooligan!

...

After Mo Yesi and Qiao Mianmian left, Michael returned to the ward with a relaxed expression.

He pushed the door open and saw Tu Yilei standing by the window and looking out quietly.

He didn’t even turn around when he heard the door open.

He seemed to be in a daze.

Michael stood at the door for a while, but he still didn’t respond.

Michael frowned slightly and walked into the room.

He stopped behind Tu Yilei and kept quiet for a while before saying softly, “Little Tu, are you still angry with me? You know that everything I do is for your own good. It’s been so many years, don’t you know how I treat you?

“Alright, I just said it out of anger. If I didn’t want to bother with you, I would’ve quit a long time ago. Why would I come here to be angered to death by you?”

Tu Yilei still didn’t react.

He didn’t even move.

He didn’t seem to hear him or see him.

He stood by the window and looked out.

“Little Tu.” Michael thought that he was still angry, so he deliberately ignored him. He frowned and patted him on the shoulder. “You’re not really angry with me, right? Who doesn’t say mean words when they’re angry? You’re so petty.

“Don’t be unhappy, let me tell you something.

“I’ve talked to that man with the surname Mo, and he’s pretty sincere. He said that he’ll compensate us with double the economic losses on our side. Moreover, he promised to give you four top-notch male lead roles, and also sign a few big advertisements for the Mo Corporation for us.

“With these resources, we don’t have to worry anymore. I didn’t expect that man surnamed Mo to have so much power in the Mo Corporation. He actually decided to sign a few big advertising contracts for the Mo Corporation next year.

“I don’t know if he can do what he says, but he didn’t seem to be bragging. What position does he hold in the Mo Corporation? His tone is as if he’s the Chairman of the Mo Corporation. Can a relative of his really have that much power?”
