Chapter 2843: Owing Gong Zeli a Favor

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

That was true.

But why did she feel like she owed Gong Zeli a favor?

Even though it was Bai Yusheng who got Gong Zeli to do it.

But in the end, it was because of her that Gong Zeli got his agency to terminate the contract with Qiao Anxin.

Moreover, from what Bai Yusheng said, he was planning to ban her?

It wouldn’t be a problem for the Young Master of the Gong Corporation to ban a newbie.

Of course, if he really wanted to shut Qiao Anxin out, Qiao Mianmian wouldn’t stop him.

She and Qiao Anxin were already strangers.

Qiao Anxin’s life and death had nothing to do with her.

Moreover, it would be beneficial to her if Qiao Anxin was banned from the entertainment industry.

It could lower the danger.

Qiao Mianmian just felt that it was better to let Mo Yesi do it instead of Gong Zeli.

In that case… she wouldn’t have to owe him anything.

The person Qiao Mianmian didn’t want to owe the most now… was Gong Zeli.

But Bai Yusheng had already spilled the beans, what else could she do?

Should she call Gong Zeli again and tell him not to bother about this?

She might as well pretend that she didn’t know anything.

Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and decided not to dwell on this matter anymore. “Brother, in that case, you agree to let me continue recording the show here?”

She was rather happy that she didn’t have to leave anymore.

“Mm, Qiao Anxin has left. If you want to continue with the recording, then stay. But after the recording, you have to go home immediately. Mom has been asking about you for the past two days, and she even told me that she wanted to go and see you. I had to persuade her to give up.

“Give her a call later and have a meal when you’re back. Otherwise, she’ll keep nagging.”

“Mm, I got it.”

“Alright, I’ll hang up first.”

After hanging up, Qiao Mianmian immediately called Madam Bai.

Madam Bai immediately picked it up and said affectionately, “Mianmian, Mom was thinking about you, then you called. Oh my, we must have telepathy.”

Qiao Mianmian felt warm inside when she heard Madam Bai’s gentle voice. She also greeted her affectionately. “Mom.”

“Ah.” Madam Bai replied happily, “Mianmian, are you used to the place? How are the living conditions there? Is it the same as the place you went to previously? Mom really doesn’t trust you at all. I wanted to go and see you, but your brother insisted that I don’t go. He said that I’d cause trouble for you. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Even your dad said so. He told me that you’re already an adult and that you can take good care of yourself. But what do those two stinky men know? Girls are different from boys. How can I be at ease without seeing you with my own eyes?”

“Mom, don’t worry. I’m fine here.” Qiao Mianmian felt even warmer hearing Madam Bai’s worried words.

Madam Qiao passed away early.

Hence, she lacked motherly love.. She didn’t experience many years of her mother’s love.
