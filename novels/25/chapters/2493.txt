Chapter 2496: Since She’s So Timid, Why Bring Her Out?

Seriously.

Where did Fourth Bro find this substitute?

She looked like she was about to cry.

If he was seen by someone who didn’t know the truth, they might really think that he was so ungentlemanly.

Su Su’s eyes were red.

Then, he saw the tears in her eyes. She was really crying.

Yan Shaoqing was speechless.

No way, she really cried.

He didn’t say anything.

“No, young lady, why are you crying? I didn’t bully you, right? I didn’t say anything harsh to you. Why are you crying, why are you crying?” Yan Shaoqing was speechless. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

He had always been gentle.

Girls were soft and gentle in front of him.

He had never made a girl cry before.

But now, Gong Zeli’s substitute actually cried because of a few words from him. She even looked so aggrieved and hurt, as if he really bullied her.

Yan Shaoqing wasn’t such an ungentlemanly man.

He wouldn’t bully a woman.

Moreover, she looked so young.

Because he liked Sis-in-law, he felt a little uncomfortable seeing this substitute.

But he never thought of embarrassing her.

“I, I…” Su Su looked at Yan Shaoqing with fear in her eyes. She bit her lip and was a little speechless. She had just said two words when her tears fell again.

Yan Shaoqing was speechless.

What was wrong with her!

He really didn’t say anything.

But now that she was crying, Yan Shaoqing felt like a villain.

He looked at Gong Zeli and gritted his teeth. “Fourth Bro, don’t look at me. I didn’t bully her. Where did you find such a girl? She’s too timid. She cried before I said anything.

“Since she’s so timid, why bring her out? Isn’t it good to let her stay at home?”

Yan Shaoqing was harsh because he was angry.

“Young Master Gong, I-I didn’t do anything wrong.” Su Su’s eyes were even redder now. She looked up at him with tears in her eyes, looking pitiful. She bit her lip and sobbed. “If Young Master Yan doesn’t like Su Su, Su Su can… go back now.”

Yan Shaoqing hated seeing women cry.

Especially beautiful women.

When a woman cried in front of him, he couldn’t help but feel pity for her.

But this was the first time he saw a woman cry, and not only did he not pity her, but he was also angry.

In the past, he and Gong Zeli used to play together, and they always had female companions.

Their female companions were all sensible people.

This was the first time Yan Shaoqing saw such an insensible woman.

This woman was actually brought by Gong Zeli.

How could he tolerate such a pretentious woman?

Based on his understanding of Gong Zeli, this sort of woman who cried so easily was definitely not his type.
