Chapter 1827: Mo Shixiu, I Think I Might Be Pregnant

“Why do I feel that you are hiding something from me?” Mo Shixiu’s eyes were sharp. He could tell at a glance that she was different from usual.

“I’m really fine.” Jiang Luoli tilted her head and blinked at him. “I just feel a little bored.”

“Bored?” Mo Shixiu was stunned. Then, he smiled gently and said, “I’m going abroad in a few days. Do you want to come with me?”

“Are you going on a business trip overseas?”

“Yeah.”

“Forget it.” Jiang Luoli had gone abroad with him once, but she wasn’t insensible and wouldn’t stick to him regardless of the situation.

Mo Shixiu was going overseas to work.

To do something serious.

She couldn’t ignore everything and affect his work just because she felt bored.

Even if he didn’t mind, she would.

Besides, it wouldn’t be good if others knew about this.

She might even be deemed a femme fatale.

And even if Mo Shixiu was willing to take her along, he wouldn’t have much time to accompany her.

He’d be working most of the time.

Therefore, even though Jiang Luoli was interested in his suggestion, she still rejected it.

“Why?” Mo Shixiu looked at her in confusion. “You don’t have time?”

“Yes, I’m going to graduate soon. I still have to prepare for my graduation work.” Jiang Luoli had also been a little busy recently. She was filming a micro movie for graduation. Calculating the time, she would have to hand in her homework soon. She really didn’t have time to go overseas with him.

Mo Shixiu nodded and said, “In that case, we really don’t have much time. Let’s wait until we are done. I can accompany you wherever you want to go.”

“Do you have the time?”

“Yes, there should be a few days of vacation after a while. You can think about where you want to go now. We’ll go together then.”

For Mo Shixiu, work was also a very important part of his life.

He couldn’t take the time to spend with his woman like other men.

But apart from working, he was willing to give Jiang Luoli all his time.

He was glad that Jiang Luoli wasn’t clingy, so even though he was busy most of the time, there was no conflict between them.

Jiang Luoli was very obedient and sensible. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

She would never ask him to put down his work to accompany her.

“Oh.” Jiang Luoli nodded.

Looking at her reaction, Mo Shixiu still felt that she was different from usual.

Normally, she would be very happy right now.

Instead of replying perfunctorily.

“Luoli.” Mo Shixiu looked at her.

“Hmm?” Jiang Luoli blinked and looked up at him.

“Are you really not hiding anything from me?” Mo Shixiu asked.

Jiang Luoli was stunned and fell silent.

“Mo Shixiu, I-I do have something to tell you.” Because of her pregnancy, Jiang Luoli had been uneasy. She hadn’t planned on telling Mo Shixiu about this before she was sure.

However, under his repeated questioning, she couldn’t bear it anymore.

Mo Shixiu wasn’t surprised at all. He looked at her calmly. “Okay, tell me.”

Jiang Luoli looked straight into his black eyes. “Mo Shixiu, I think I might be pregnant.”

Mo Shixiu didn’t react for a moment. After being stunned for a few seconds, his eyes widened in shock. “What did you say? You’re pregnant?”
