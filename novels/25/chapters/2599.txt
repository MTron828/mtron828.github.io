Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Hello, Mrs. Mo.”

Two women in fashionable clothes walked out from behind the butler and reached out to Qiao Mianmian with a smile. “I’m Emma. I’ll be in charge of your makeup later.”

“Hello, Mrs. Mo. I’m Wei Ya. I’ll be in charge of your hair later.”

“Hello. Sorry to trouble you.” Qiao Mianmian shook their hands.

…

Wei Ya and Emma were very efficient. It only took them two hours to do her hair and makeup.

Her makeup was a little thicker than usual.

Qiao Mianmian’s facial features were very exquisite, and she looked very good with light makeup.

With a little more makeup, her facial features became more prominent, making it even more exquisite and perfect.

She looked very pure wearing light makeup.

She didn’t look gorgeous, but she looked more charming and flirtatious than usual. There was a hint of femininity in her innocence, making her even more beautiful.

Her hair was tied into a thin braid behind her ear, and there was a crystal tassel in the braid. The tassel fell beside her ear and swayed gently as she walked. It echoed with the light on her dress, making her look shiny from head to toe.

What kind of beauties had Wei Ya and Emma not seen before?

There was no lack of good-looking people in the entertainment industry.

But after they were done with Qiao Mianmian’s makeup and styling, the two of them were rather stunned.

There were many good-looking female artistes in the entertainment industry.

But it was rare to see someone as beautiful as Qiao Mianmian.

The two of them looked at the beautiful girl in front of them and thought at the same time: “No wonder a pure man like Chairman Mo is willing to marry her. Which man would be indifferent to such a beauty?”

She was definitely like those kingdom-destroying beauties in the history books. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

She was so beautiful, had acting skills, and had such a powerful backing…

Even if she was just playing around in the entertainment industry, she was destined to be popular.

“Why are you all staring at me like this?” Qiao Mianmian turned around and saw that Emma and Wei Ya were looking at her strangely. Feeling a little uncomfortable, she touched her face and hair. “Is something wrong?”

Qiao Mianmian rarely dressed up like this.

She had accompanied Mo Yesi to a banquet before, but it was different this time.

This was her first time attending the Golden Globe Awards party.

She valued it.

“There’s nothing wrong.” Wei Ya was the first to return to her senses. Smiling, she didn’t hide her admiration. “It’s just that Mrs. Mo is too beautiful, so I was a little stunned.”

“Mrs. Mo has the best foundation among all the female artistes I’ve worked with. It’s really easy and pleasant to do your makeup.” Emma was full of praise. “Mrs. Mo’s skin is very good. It’s not an exaggeration to say that it’s fragile. Moreover, your facial features are very good. I just need to deepen your original facial features. There’s no need to make any changes.”

Emma wasn’t flattering the rich lady, she was telling the truth.

It was easy to do Qiao Mianmian’s makeup
