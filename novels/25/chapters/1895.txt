Chapter 1896: Change Now?

She never expected that the person who requested Song Ke to be removed would be President Mo.

No matter how much she disagreed, she had to remove Song Ke.

Because no one could offend the Mo Family.

A small television station dared not.

Regardless of whether Mo Yesi’s request was reasonable, they had to follow his instructions.

The executive director was about to call her subordinates to inform Song Ke when her cell phone rang again.

It was the person who called just now.

The person on the other end of the line said a few more words, and the director frowned. “What, change the location? Change now?

“That’s not it. We’ve already made prior arrangements for our shoot. We haven’t even prepared anything yet, so how are we going to change locations? Where are we going? Don’t try to come up with all sorts of things. Isn’t that making things difficult for us?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

After a while.

The director was shocked again.

“Alright, I understand. I’ll arrange it immediately.”

The call ended.

The director was still in shock.

She was still surprised by what she had just learned.

She had been wondering why Song Ke had suddenly been removed and why she had been informed to change the filming location.

So it was all because of that newbie called Qiao Mianmian.

Mo Yesi was actually her boyfriend.

Removing Song Ke was because she was probably the one who spread the rumor that Qiao Mianmian was raped by Third Chen.

The change of locations was also related to him.

Although Third Chen had been arrested, Mo Yesi felt that this remote mountain village was no longer safe and didn’t want his girlfriend to stay here anymore.

Everyone knew that changing places at the last minute was a very troublesome matter.

Not only would it delay the progress of the entire production team, but it’d also cost a lot of money.

However, this was Mo Yesi’s request, and even the station head did not dare to reject it. Furthermore, Mo Yesi was the one who would bear all the expenses.

Many people said that Qiao Mianmian’s boyfriend was unreliable and that the two of them wouldn’t last long.

After all, one was a newbie in the entertainment industry while the other was a young master from a wealthy family. Their statuses were not compatible.

They said that he was just playing around with her. When the novelty passed, he would replace her.

But as a woman, the director was a little envious of Qiao Mianmian.

He had already taken it so seriously. How was this just for fun?

Even if they would be separated in the future, at least he really doted on her now.

...

When Song Ke was informed that they would be terminating her collaboration with “The Meaning of Traveling”, her reaction was huge. “The program team has decided to disqualify me as a guest? Why? Who made this decision? Why did they cancel the collaboration?”

Seeing that she was so agitated, the staff member quickly explained, “Miss Song, this is our director’s idea. She said that after filming for a few days, after observation, she felt that Miss Song was not very suitable for our show.

“Of course, we broke the contract first. Miss Song can ask us to pay the penalty later.

“My message has been delivered. Miss Song, if you have any other questions, you can ask our director.”

After saying that, the staff member left.

Song Ke stood in the room with an ugly expression.

How could she accept leaving the show now?

To be able to appear on this variety show was an opportunity that she had spent a lot of effort to fight for. This was a great opportunity for her to become famous.
