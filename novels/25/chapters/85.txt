Chapter 86: Her Husband... Is Way Too Rich!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“If you don’t know how to do that, I can get someone to teach you.”

Qiao Mianmian was quiet.

What sort of request was this?

He wanted to get someone to teach her to be a spendthrift?

“The money a man earns is meant for his wife to spend. If you don’t spend my money, I’ll feel as if I haven’t achieved enough.”

She was speechless.

“Mianmian, if you don’t spend my money, I’ll think that you haven’t fully accepted that I’m your husband.”

Qiao Mianmian felt something. She looked down and realized that Mo Yesi had stuffed a black card in her hand.

He then kissed her softly. “The cap for this card is a million yuan a month. It’s your allowance. Buy anything you need, you don’t have to save money for me. Tell me if it isn’t enough.”

“Don’t you reject me and make me angry, okay?”

A million yuan a month as an allowance?

Qiao Mianmian had no idea what to think.

Her husband... was way too rich!

She fiddled with the black card in her hand. “Do you always give this much money to others as an allowance?”

“Of course not.” The man swept her a glance. “You’re too bad at spending, so I gave you a little less first.”

Qiao Mianmian was quiet.

Chairman Mo, this is madness!

The waiter quickly served the food they had ordered.

Seeing the expensive delicacies on the table, Qiao Mianmian felt as if she was eating money and not food!

She couldn’t bear to waste any of it and ended up finishing every dish.

By the time she was done, she was so stuffed she could barely move.

Mo Yesi pulled her in for an embrace and smiled. “Full?”

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian nodded and touched her belly. “Really full.”

She couldn’t go any further.

In fact, she had no idea she could eat this much.

The amount she ate in this meal alone was what she usually ate for a whole day.

“Since I’ve fed you well, shouldn’t you accede to a request of mine now?”

Qiao Mianmian was a little stunned. “What request?”

She was wondering if he wanted a kiss from her or something.

Her face went red instantly.

But Mo Yesi carried her to the couch and then buried his head by her neck and murmured, “Accompany me to sleep.”

“Wait, what?!”

Qiao Mianmian went even redder. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

She lied against him in embarrassment. “Mo Yesi, get up! I don’t want to sleep with you here!”

This was too perverted!

What was he expecting to do with her in a public place...

He was shameless!

Qiao Mianmian was embarrassed and frustrated. She felt disrespected...

Although she had married him, this wasn’t the right place to engage in such activity.

What if someone suddenly opened the door?

And even if no one came in, it still wasn’t appropriate.

“If not here, then where?” Mo Yesi seemed to be falling asleep. “Just sleep with me for an hour. It won’t get in the way of your afternoon classes.

“Mianmian, I’m sleepy. Let me sleep for a while...”

The man’s breathing slowed down and became a steady, comfortable rhythm as he rested against her, now unconscious.
