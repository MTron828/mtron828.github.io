Chapter 2070: Choosing Her So Quickly

Qiao Mianmian was really impressed by Mo Nan.

The song was so good, and so were the lyrics.

No wonder everyone said that Mo Nan was a musical freak. He was indeed very talented.

She felt that the lyrics were already very good. There was no need to change them.

Qiao Mianmian looked at the lyrics for a while and sang it in her heart.

“Are you ready?” Mo Nan asked her.

She nodded. “Yes, I’m ready.”

“Then, let’s begin.” Mo Nan sat down in front of the piano and adjusted the tune. His slender fingers skillfully pressed on the keys a few times, and very quickly, a smooth and beautiful sound could be heard.

Qiao Mianmian started singing along.

The first time, she was still a little rusty.

But by the second time, she was in a much better state.

The song ended.

Mo Nan closed the score and got up. He said to Qiao Mianmian directly, “Can you come over tomorrow to officially record the song?”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

Mo Nan looked at her confused expression and asked, “Is there a problem?”

“No…” Qiao Mianmian shook her head. “I’m fine. Senior Mo, do you think I sang correctly?”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned because she didn’t expect Mo Nan to choose her so quickly.

After all, she felt that her performance wasn’t good enough.

She thought Mo Nan would be dissatisfied.

“There’s a little problem, but it’s not a big problem. I’ll teach you how to handle the details when the time comes. Your voice is very good, and your range is very wide. These two songs are very suitable for you.”

“Then, it’s settled.” Bai Yusheng smiled as he walked over and patted Mo Nan on the shoulder. “Old Mo, I knew that Mianmian wouldn’t disappoint you. Record these two songs well. This is her first work in the music industry, it’s very important to her.”

Mo Nan smiled and pushed his hand away. He then walked to the coffee machine and poured a cup of freshly brewed coffee.

Mo Nan was lazy, but he was a very picky person.

For example, when he drank coffee, he only drank coffee brewed from top-notch coffee beans. Moreover, he didn’t find it troublesome at all. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

He took another glass and handed it to Bai Yusheng.

Bai Yusheng took it and then took a sip. “Tastes good.”

“Of course it tastes good. I managed to get these coffee beans five years ago. Only you have such a good taste.” Mo Nan took another sip and then said slowly, “Don’t you know my ability? I haven’t released a song in years. Do you think I’ll ruin my reputation?”

“I have nothing to doubt about your ability.” Bai Yusheng smiled. “Then, that’s it. I’ll bring Mianmian over tomorrow to record the songs.”

“Mm.”

“Mianmian, let’s go. We’ll come back tomorrow.”

…

They left Mo Nan’s house.

Knowing that Qiao Mianmian and Bai Yusheng were together, Madam Bai called and said to her son, “Yusheng, are you with your sister? When are you coming back? You and Mianmian can come home for dinner.”

“Mom, I can come back, but Mianmian can’t.”

“Why?”

Bai Yusheng glanced at Qiao Mianmian. “Mom, your daughter and son-in-law have a date tonight, they can’t eat with us.”
