“Yeah, but I got Wei Zheng to investigate. We’ll find out sooner or later.”

After talking about this matter, the two of them talked about some daily matters before hanging up after half an hour.

Qiao Mianmian had just hung up when she heard someone knocking on the door.

She got up from the bed and walked over to open the door.

At first glance, she saw a large bouquet of pink roses with dew on them. Then, a faint rose fragrance wafted into her nose.

She was stunned for a moment. Shen Fei smiled and said to her, “Mianmian, someone just delivered flowers. They said they were for you. This must be from Mr. Mo. This bouquet of flowers is so beautiful. Take it.”

It was a huge bouquet of flowers.

Qiao Mianmian quickly took the bouquet from Shen Fei. “Thank you, Sister Shen.”

Shen Fei then left.

Qiao Mianmian returned to the bedroom with the flowers. She was about to send Mo Yesi a WeChat message to ask if he had sent her flowers when her phone rang.

She took it out to take a look, only to receive a text message from an unknown number.

Qiao Mianmian frowned when she saw the message.

138XX: [Mianmian, I’m back in China. Can we meet?]

Before Qiao Mianmian could reply, another text message came in.

It was from that unknown number.

138XX: [I miss you, I really want to see you. I have so many things to say to you. Mianmian, can we meet?]

Qiao Mianmian frowned even harder when she saw the new message.

She had already guessed who this number belonged to.

She looked down at the pink roses in her arms and thought of a possibility. Disgust flashed in her eyes, and she threw the flowers on the table.

She replied: [Who are you?]

Very quickly, the other party replied: [It’s me, Su Ze.]

Qiao Mianmian had already guessed it.

But when she saw Su Ze’s reply, her expression darkened. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

She never thought that Su Ze would have the cheek to look for her.

He actually had the cheek to say that he wanted to meet her.

Qiao Mianmian suppressed her disgust and replied: [I just received a bouquet of flowers. Was it from you?]

Su Ze replied instantly, [Yes. I remember that you like pink roses the most. It’s a new breed that was specially flown over from overseas. Do you like it?]

The scent of roses filled the air.

Qiao Mianmian did like pink roses.

However, when she looked at the bouquet of roses with dewdrops on it, she felt disgusted.

Because the person who sent the flowers disgusted her.

Hence, even her favorite flowers had become something she disliked.

With a dark expression, she thought about it and called Su Ze.

He picked up immediately.

An excited voice sounded, “Mianmian, you called me. I’m so happy, I...”

“Su Ze, do you think that it’s not enough to just assign you overseas? Do you still want to be assigned to further places? Or do you feel that your life is too good now and you want to experience what it’s like to have a bad life?”

“Mianmian, you...” Su Ze didn’t sound as excited as before.
