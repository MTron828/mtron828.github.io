Chapter 556: It Started With Your Looks, but It Became More Than That

“I would have taken action if I liked her. It’s never my style to be passive.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She wasn’t going to deny that.

He was truly a man of action.

If not, she wouldn’t have gotten married to him the first day they met.

Hence, he couldn’t have liked Shen Rou.

But she was his type?

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t believe it.

It wasn’t that she was insecure, but the reason they got together wasn’t that they were in love with each other. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

She did it for Qiao Chen.

He... did it because of that weird habit of his.

It was just a marriage out of necessity.

But, this marriage out of necessity had some changes along the way.

She changed from someone ready to get out of the marriage at any moment to being excited about it.

She also started to accept Mo Yesi as her husband and the fact that she was a married woman.

“Is there anything else?” He touched her nose playfully and continued, “You can continue your interrogation any time you want. I’ll answer to the best of my ability.”

Qiao Mianmian lost her curiosity at his honesty.

She didn’t have many things that she was curious about too.

She shook her head and replied, “I’ve nothing else that I want to ask.”

“Are you sure?” Mo Yesi replied dejectedly. “Think about it. Is there nothing that you’re curious about?”

“There’s one question...”

“Hmm?”

“Mo Yesi, what do you like about me?” Qiao Mianmian asked with a serious face. “You’re attracted to my looks, right?”

She didn’t have anything but her looks.

Mo Yesi was speechless.

He recalled what she said to Shen Rou.

She claimed that she got together with him because of his good looks.

Even though he knew she wasn’t serious, he was curious about what she really thought of him.

Qiao Mianmian was shocked by the question. “But I asked first...”

“Hmm, it started with your looks, but it progressed beyond that,” Mo Yesi replied. “I’m not really sure why, but you’re just my type.

“I knew it the first time I saw you.”

He had never bottled up his feelings in front of her.

It wasn’t the first time that he pronounced his love for her.

But at this moment, Qiao Mianmian was touched.

She would be touched no matter how many times he professed his love for her.

Who could resist him?

“I’ve given my answer. It’s your turn now,” Mo Yesi said as he held her chin up. Even though he appeared calm, he was actually nervous and excited about her answer.

He was waiting for her reply.

Feeling two very conflicting emotions.

He was afraid that the answer might disappoint him.

But he was excited about what the answer would be too.

“I...” Qiao Mianmian opened her mouth. But just as she was about to answer, someone knocked on the door.

Wei Zheng’s voice called, “Chairman Mo, are we still having the meeting? Everyone’s waiting for you in the meeting room.”

The sudden sound displeased Mo Yesi. He wanted to postpone the meeting. However, he realized that he had a lot of matters to attend to, so he frowned and let go of Qiao Mianmian’s waist.
