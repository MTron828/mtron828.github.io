Chapter 189: Feed me

Mo Yesi looked at her for a few seconds and then smiled. “They don’t know about our marriage yet.”

“What?” Shen Rou feigned astonishment. “You haven’t told them? It’s a major milestone, how could you...”

“Mianmian isn’t ready.”

Mo Yesi turned to face the girl beside him and patted her on the head. “I’ll take her home only when she’s ready.

“Before that, if she doesn’t wish to go to my house yet, then we shan’t go.”

He didn’t sound especially gentle, but it wasn’t hard to detect the affection in it.

He made it very clear.

Regardless of the matter, he would respect Qiao Mianmian’s decision. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

They’d do it her way.

How much did a man like Mo Yesi have to love her for him to pamper her this way?

Especially when he had always been used to making decisions on his own.

It had always been others compromising and going along with his say, never the other way around.

Even Yan Shaoqing and Gong Zeli were surprised to hear him say that, let alone Shen Rou.

Shen Rou asked this because she thought that Mo Yesi wasn’t ready to take Qiao Mianmian home to his parents.

She wanted to let Qiao Mianmian know this.

But Mo Yesi’s reply was a slap to her own face.

“Oh, i-is it?” Shen Rou’s voice shook.

“Mm,” Mo Yesi replied simply.

At this point, the waiter entered with a serving of ice-cream.

He had ordered it for Qiao Mianmian.

Mo Yesi received it and handed it to her. “Don’t eat too much, lest you get an upset stomach.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She really wanted to say, Chairman Mo, can you not treat me this well?

It’s really stressful!

She’d felt the weight on her shoulders ever since she realized that Shen Rou liked Mo Yesi.

How could she not feel pressured? She was sharing a table with a woman who saw her as a love rival!

And yet Mo Yesi was overtly showing her so much concern. Qiao Mianmian felt as if she could see the daggers in Shen Rou’s eyes.

Just like... at this exact moment.

She took a bite of the ice-cream and immediately heard the man beside her chuckle. “Is it good?”

“Uh...” Qiao Mianmian swallowed the ice-cream and said, “It’s pretty good.”

It was such a high-class restaurant, how could anything be subpar?

“Mm.” Mo Yesi nodded. “Let me try some.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“Y-You want to try some?” She looked up at him.

Mo Yesi raised a brow. “I can’t?”

“Of course you can.”

But didn’t he say he wasn’t really into desserts?

And she’d never seen him have them before.

“Then let me try some,” Mo Yesi repeated.

“Oh, okay.” Qiao Mianmian had no idea why he was so interested all of a sudden, but she handed the spoon to him anyway.

But Mo Yesi did not take the spoon. Instead, he smiled alluringly and looked her in the eye. “Feed me.”

A coughing fit ensued.

Yan Shaoqing accidentally spat the red wine he was drinking.

Gong Zeli, sitting beside him, was on the receiving end of it. His prim white top was dotted with maroon drops.

Gong Zeli’s expression instantly darkened as he turned towards him with a murderous look.

“Cough! Fourth Bro, I-I didn’t mean it.”
