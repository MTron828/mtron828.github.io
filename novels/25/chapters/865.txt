Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Anyway, don’t think too much about it. Since he chose you, he’s naturally very satisfied with you. It’s getting late, I’ll send you back?”

Qiao Mianmian felt a warmth in her heart when she heard his gentle voice and his patient comforting. “Brother Bai, thank you. Thank you for pulling the strings for me and for giving me such a good opportunity. Thank you for being so patient with me.”

At this moment, she couldn’t help but think how nice it would be if Bai Yusheng was really her brother.

She really wanted such a good brother to pamper her.

Everyone was happy to have a brother.

Having a brother like Bai Yusheng was even more blissful.

She wondered if he could find his lost sister.

If he did, Bai Yusheng would definitely pamper her.

He treated her so well even though they weren’t related by blood.

It would be even better for his sister who had been separated from him for so many years.

She was suddenly envious of his sister. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“What’s there to thank me for.” Bai Yusheng looked into her eyes and kept quiet for a while. He then smiled and said, “I have my own selfish motives for helping you.”

If it was anyone else, he wouldn’t have bothered.

Qiao Mianmian’s heart skipped a beat. “Selfishness? What selfishness?”

“Didn’t I say that I feel relaxed and comfortable with you?” Bai Yusheng smiled and thought for a while before continuing, “You give me the feeling of a sister.

“So, I can’t help but want to treat you better.

“This is my selfishness.”

Qiao Mianmian was touched by his words. She pursed her lips and hesitated for a while before saying, “Brother Bai, there’s something I’m not sure if I should say.”

She was afraid that he would think that she was trying to get close to him.

Bai Yusheng raised his brows. “You don’t have to worry in front of me. Just say what you want to say.”

Qiao Mianmian kept quiet for a while more before looking at his handsome face and saying softly, “I feel that Brother Bai is like my brother too. Don’t misunderstand, I’m not trying to get close to you or anything. It’s just that Brother Bai is too good to me. I feel like I have another brother.”

Bai Yusheng was stunned for a moment before smiling. “Mo Yesi and I have been friends for many years, and I’m a few years older than him. Now that you’re with him, it’s alright to treat me as an older brother.

“Moreover, I think it’d be nice if you were my sister.”

He really liked Qiao Mianmian.

Although she wasn’t his biological sister, it wasn’t a big deal to acknowledge a girl he liked as his sister.

Qiao Mianmian was a little stunned. “Can we do that?”

“Of course you can. I’ve already told others that you’re my cousin. This news will spread very quickly. If anyone asks about it in the future, just admit it directly. This way, there won’t be any rumors in the production crew. Also, if you become my cousin, no one in the industry will dare to have any designs on you.”

Actually, as long as she announced that she was Chairman Mo’s girlfriend, no one would dare to lay their hands on her.

But judging from the current situation, she wasn’t prepared to publicize it.

He understood that Mo Yesi was very possessive. It was probably not his decision to hide their relationship.

That was Qiao Mianmian’s decision.

It was understandable.
