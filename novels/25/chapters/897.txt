Chapter 898: Mo Yesi, Calm Down

They had eyes, nose, and mouth.

But when it grew out, it had a thousand sides. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

He stood there quietly, his expression cold and distant. The women around him couldn’t help but look at him a few times. Some of them wanted to talk to him but were stopped by his cold aura.

This man was good-looking, but he looked too cold and unapproachable.

Girls were thin-skinned, to begin with, and it wasn’t easy for them to muster up the courage to speak up.

They didn’t dare to approach him even if they wanted to.

At most, they would steal a few glances and take photos.

Qiao Mianmian stood at the door and admired her husband’s good looks for a while before walking towards him.

As if sensing something, the man turned around and looked at her.

When he saw her, his coldness and alienation instantly vanished. Even his eyes softened.

He immediately walked towards Qiao Mianmian.

The man had long legs and was quick to walk towards her.

He looked at her from head to toe and then hugged her tightly.

Someone looked over.

Wearing a mask, Qiao Mianmian buried her face in his chest. She felt a little embarrassed to be hugged by him like this in public. “Mo Yesi, let go. You’re hugging me too tightly.”

The man didn’t seem to hear her.

Not only did he not let go at all, he even hugged her tighter.

That pair of strong arms were like branding iron, wanting to sink into her body.

Qiao Mianmian could barely breathe.

She placed her hand on his chest and gently pushed him away. “Mo Yesi, don’t be agitated. Aren’t I fine now? Let go a little, alright? I can’t breathe.”

The man finally looked down at her. Seeing that her face was a little red from holding it in, he relaxed his hold, but he still refused to let go.

“Qiao Mianmian.” He called her name softly.

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian replied.

“Thank goodness you’re alright.” Mo Yesi tightened his grip and lowered his head to smell the fragrance in her hair. He was still afraid when he thought of the danger she’d been in. “Thank goodness you’re standing in front of me safe and sound.”

At this moment, he was grateful to Tu Yilei.

No matter what this man thought of Qiao Mianmian... If he hadn’t shielded her...

His expression changed as he thought of the possible consequences.

Huang Yilin...

For daring to touch his woman, he would let her know what regret was.

He would never give her a chance to hurt Qiao Mianmian again.

“Mm, I’m fine.”

Qiao Mianmian could feel that he was emotionally unstable. She hugged him and patted his back. “Mo Yesi, can we talk somewhere else? There are so many people here.”

People passing by would glance at them.

She didn’t like being stared at by too many people.

Mo Yesi hugged her for a while and slowly calmed down.

He looked at the people around them and let go of Qiao Mianmian. He then wrapped his arm around her waist and led her down the stairs.
