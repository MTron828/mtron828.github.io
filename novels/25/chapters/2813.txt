Chapter 2816: Naturally Have Many Privileges

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Mianmian is right. We should invite the others. I don’t think they will go. It’s alright to call them,” Qin Han said.

“Alright, I’ll ask them.” Zhan Bo didn’t say anything else.

After all, the minority obeyed the majority.

…

Just as Qin Han said, Zhan Bo invited the others, but they tactfully rejected him.

Jiang Xinyue was one of them.

Initially, Zhan Bo didn’t want to ask her, but if he just left her alone, they would probably say that he was ostracizing and bullying newbies.

His manager called him in the afternoon.

Only then did Zhan Bo know that the marketing accounts had deliberately made him a bully.

—”Bully the newbie with his qualifications and fame”

The newbie he bullied was Jiang Xinyue.

Of course, these marketing accounts weren’t really righteous.

It was just for money.

Some companies wanted to defame him and bribed many accounts to create negative news about him.

Thankfully, his company wasn’t a pushover.

They immediately used public relations and spent money to suppress this matter.

Moreover, he had many fans.

The opposing company couldn’t compete with him in terms of wealth, and they didn’t have as many fans. This deliberate defamation was a failure. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

But his manager emphasized it to him.

Even if he really didn’t like Jiang Xinyue, he couldn’t make it too obvious.

He didn’t want to be criticized again.

When Zhan Bo asked, he thought that if Jiang Xinyue was thick-skinned enough to go with them, he could find an excuse and cancel the night out.

He’d rather not go out.

Hr didn’t want Jiang Xinyue to go with them.

Thankfully, she wasn’t as thick-skinned as he thought.

…

At night, they found a very unique barbeque restaurant. After dinner, they went to a high-end clubhouse called “Lan Ya Pavilion”.

The name was very classy. It was the largest entertainment club in the area.

Of course, it was the highest grade.

Most of the people who frequented it weren’t ordinary.

Qiao Mianmian and the rest were no ordinary people.

Qiao Mianmian used her name to book a room.

When she said her name, the employee on the other end of the line took a while before asking in a slightly surprised tone, “May I ask if you’re Miss Qiao Mianmian who acted in ‘If You Can’t Love’?”

After receiving her affirmation, the other party’s attitude became much warmer. “Alright, Miss Qiao. We’ve already reserved a private room for you. We only have one VIP room left today. It’s originally reserved for a few bosses all year round. But it’s fine if it’s Miss Qiao.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “Are you my fan?”

She thought that the other party was her fan, so she gave her this special treatment.

Unexpectedly, the other party said, “Miss Qiao, your husband, Chairman Mo, is one of Lan Ya Pavilion’s investors. Doesn’t Miss Qiao know? You’re his wife, so you naturally have many privileges.”

Qiao Mianmian was confused.

She really didn’t know.

Alright, she’d always felt that Mo Yesi’s businesses were in Yuncheng City.. She’d never thought that he actually had businesses elsewhere.
