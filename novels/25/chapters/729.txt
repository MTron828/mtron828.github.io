Chapter 730: Of Course... I Have to Coax Her Personally

He hadn’t reached the airport when he received Bai Yusheng’s message.

He could return halfway.

But he still boarded the plane.

Since his wife was safe and sound, there was only one reason for her to ignore him.

She didn’t want to talk to him.

Mo Yesi suddenly realized that his wife was angry.

She was angry at him for not picking up her calls.

Hence, she ignored him.

What if his wife got angry and ignored him?

Of course... he had to coax her personally.

At the Mo Residence.

When Madam Mo called again and realized that she had been blocked, she was so angry that she almost smashed her cell phone on the ground.

“He must be possessed. He actually blacklisted my number. He’s such an unfilial son! He actually did this to his own mother for that actress. Is he mad?

“What exactly did that vixen feed him?

“How did he become like this!”

This was the first time in her life that she had been blacklisted by her own son. The veins on Madam Mo’s forehead bulged.

She wasn’t elegant or dignified at all.

Shen Rou’s expression turned awful when she found out that Mo Yesi had blacklisted Madam Mo. But she still had to put on a gentle and understanding front. “Aunt Mo, Ah Si... blacklisted you? What exactly happened?”

“Unfilial son.” Madam Mo was so angry that her chest was heaving up and down. “I only said a few words about that vixen, and he’s already angry at me. He even said that if I ever talk about his wife again, don’t blame him for being unfilial.

“Rourou, do you think a son should say these things? He actually threatened his mother.

“In the past, Ah Si always listened to me and would never go against me like this. But now...” Madam Mo clenched her fists, her heart filled with anger and sadness. “I feel like he’s a different person. I can’t control him anymore.

“In his heart, that vixen is the most important. If I were to have a direct conflict with that vixen one day, he’d definitely help her. Tell me, why would I want such a son?

“I finally know why there’s such a saying. My unfilial son is the best example.”

Madam Mo got more upset as she spoke, and she couldn’t help but tear up.

She felt especially aggrieved and upset.

She was the closest person to her son.

But now, the most important woman in her son’s heart had become someone else.

As a mother, she had to be in the back.

As she thought about all the hardships she went through when she was pregnant and how she almost had a miscarriage on the day of her childbirth, she started crying even more sadly.

“Aunt Mo, don’t cry.”

Shen Rou was extremely frustrated. She thought that she would be able to settle everything tonight and quickly marry Mo Yesi, becoming the woman who would accompany him for the rest of his life.

Who knew...

Mo Yesi actually flew to City F.

He was worried about that b*tch. She was worried that he would fly over to look for her the moment he got off work.

She’d thought that he was a man who didn’t know how to love.
