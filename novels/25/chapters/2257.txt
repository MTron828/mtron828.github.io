Chapter 2259: Don’t You Know Your Own Abilities?

“Can you help me?” she said hurriedly.

Su Ze sneered. “Me? I signed you to earn money for the company. You didn’t bring any benefits to the company, so why should I spend money to help you?”

Qiao Anxin was stunned, and her expression turned even uglier. She gripped her cell phone tightly and said with a pale face, “I will bring benefits to the company. When I become popular in the future, I…”

“You’ll be popular in the future?” Su Ze sneered again and said disdainfully, “Qiao Anxin, do you really have no self-awareness? Do you think you became popular with your own abilities? If I hadn’t spent so many resources to support you, would you have risen so high?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“You did groom me, but don’t I have any ability at all?” Qiao Anxin wasn’t convinced. “Su Ze, it’s true that you groomed me. But even if you didn’t, I’d still be popular. It’s just that it’d take more time.”

“Haha. Qiao Anxin, it seems like you really have no self-awareness. If you were as good-looking as Mianmian, even if you didn’t have any acting skills, I could quickly make you popular. But you don’t have good acting skills, and your looks aren’t top-notch. Back then, without me supporting you, not to mention an A-lister, even a B-lister would have nothing to do with you.

“Otherwise, after you left Star Splendor, do you still think you’re popular? Those Weibo fans of yours, their comments and reposts every time you post on Weibo, as well as the rankings you’re on, and the people who pick you up at the airport every time, which of them weren’t handled by me?

“Without these behind-the-scenes operations, your real results would only be a joke.

“Stop dreaming about being an A-lister. With your qualifications, it’s already good enough if you get into the C-list.”

Qiao Anxin’s expression darkened.

What angered her even more was that Su Ze actually compared her to Qiao Mianmian.

He praised Qiao Mianmian like a fairy but belittled her.

“Qiao Anxin, this is the first and last time I’m warning you. I’ll try my best to settle this for you, but if there’s a next time, I won’t bother anymore. When the time comes, I’ll also terminate the contract with you.

“Just you wait.”

Su Ze hung up.

Qiao Anxin’s face turned green as she heard the disconnected tone. She was shaking with anger.

“Anxin, you were hit?” Lin Huizhen asked worriedly. “What happened? Who hit you?”

Qiao Anxin ignored her.

She kept thinking about what Su Ze said.

She knew that Qiao Mianmian was very pretty.

As long as she was with Qiao Mianmian, no one would praise her for her looks.

And those who praised her only meant that she was cute.

But they praised Qiao Mianmian and said that she looked like a little fairy.

Although the Qiao family used to have some money, it wasn’t very good.

The reason why the Su family approached the Qiao family was that Su Ze fell in love with Qiao Mianmian at a banquet.

The Su parents also liked her.

After that, Qiao Mianmian broke up with Su Ze and got to know Mo Yesi.

All because of her charming face.

So it was really important to have a pretty face.
