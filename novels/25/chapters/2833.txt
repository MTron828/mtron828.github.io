Chapter 2834: Get Lost

Moreover, Gong Zeli treated that substitute very well.

If it wasn’t because he liked Qiao Mianmian, that slut, how could he have found a substitute for her?

But if Gong Zeli really liked that slut, why wouldn’t he be interested in her?

Did she make a mistake?

Just as Qiao Anxin was wondering what was going on with Gong Zeli, she heard him say coldly, “Who allowed you to see me? Who are you? Get out.”

Qiao Anxin looked up in shock.

Her eyes widened in disbelief.

Gong Zeli… told her to get lost?

She suspected that she’d heard wrongly.

Hence, she couldn’t help but ask, “Young Master Gong, w-what did you say? Do you have some misunderstanding about me? You’re my boss, I just wanted to say hi to you.”

“I told you to get lost.” Gong Zeli’s eyes and voice were cold. “I’m not interested in a vulgar woman like you. Get out now, don’t be an eyesore.”

This time, Qiao Anxin heard him clearly.

She looked at Gong Zeli in shock.

He actually told her to get lost.

He even said that she was too vulgar and he wasn’t interested in her.

Qiao Anxin couldn’t believe that Gong Zeli would treat her this way.

Not only was he not interested in her as she expected, she even saw a hint of disgust in his eyes.

Things didn’t go as she expected.

It was far beyond her expectations.

Thinking that she’d definitely be able to take down Gong Zeli tonight, Qiao Anxin panicked.

How could this be…

She couldn’t understand why things turned out this way.

Was she wrong? Was Gong Zeli really not interested in that slut?

Were all the rumors false?

Wouldn’t everything she planned for tonight be for nothing?

Qiao Anxin’s face turned pale.

If Gong Zeli really wasn’t interested in Qiao Mianmian, not only did her plan fail, everything she did for the past year had also been ruined.

She had done plastic surgery to look like Qiao Mianmian and got Su Ze to sign her with the Gong Corporation’s management agency. She wanted to get close to Gong Zeli first and find a way to cozy up to him so that she could get what she wanted from him. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Her next target was Mo Yesi.

She did everything well.

She also believed that her plan would never fail.

She came back with confidence.

But if she lost her chips right from the start.

How could she win?

“Young Master Gong, I, I…” Qiao Anxin looked into Gong Zeli’s cold eyes and trembled in fear.

She was fearful of the man in front of her, but she couldn’t bear to leave.

She was indignant.

She didn’t believe she was wrong.

Gong Zeli even cut off all ties with Mo Yesi for that slut.

How could he not be interested in her?

She didn’t believe it. She had to confirm it again.

She couldn’t leave so easily.

“Young Master Gong, it’s so boring to drink alone. Can I drink with you?”
