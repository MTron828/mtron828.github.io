Chapter 134: His Fighting Spirit Isn’t Too Good

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

After all, Mo Yesi was her husband now.

Qiao Mianmian felt a need to defend him.

She needed to let others know that her husband was a very normal man.

Yan Shaoqing paused for a while before whispering in a secretive manner, “Sis-in-law, is Second Bro beside you now? He didn’t hear what I said about him, right?”

“No, he isn’t beside me. He’s in the shower.”

“Shower?” Yan Shaoqing went silent for a bit. He then said cheekily, “He’s showering so early in the night? Hm, seems like his fighting spirit isn’t too good. But Sis-in-law, don’t you worry. Second Bro is an old virgin, they’re all like this at first. I’ll pass on some skills to him the next time we meet, and I assure you he’ll be much better the next time.”

Qiao Mianmian was shaken.

Did this Young Master Yan misunderstand something?!

What did he mean by “fighting spirit isn’t too good”, or that he would “be much better the next time”?!

Did he think that she and Mo Yesi had just finished doing something, and that was why Mo Yesi was taking a shower?!

Qiao Mianmian’s cheeks burned when she thought about that. She quickly explained, “Mr. Yan, you’ve misunderstood. It isn’t what you think.”

“Alright, alright. I know.” Young Master Yan spoke like he was very experienced and cheekily went on, “Since Sis-in-law and Second Bro are busy now, I won’t bother you any further. Help me let Second Bro know that Young Lady Shen is returning tomorrow. She’ll touch down at 10:30 in the morning, so he could receive her if possible.

“I’ll send him the flight details later.

“Oh right, we have a gathering tomorrow to welcome Young Lady Shen. Sis-in-law, come along! The other buddies and I have been wanting to see you.

“Oh, oh! Sis-in-law, come with Ah Si tomorrow. We’re bringing our family members along. Ah Si used to come along because there wasn’t anyone else for him to take along. Now that he has you, he’s got to show us how you’re like!”

Another man beside Yan Shaoqing called her Sis-in-law as well and added.

It seemed like a young man too.

Qiao Mianmian was turning red from the way they addressed her, but she couldn’t reject their invitation. “I’ll let him know later.”

The call finally ended.

Qiao Mianmian touched her cheeks and realized how warm they were. She was curious about the Young Lady Shen that Yan Shaoqing mentioned.

She actually wanted to know what this Young Lady Shen was like.

After all, she had to be a really outstanding woman in order to be Mo Yesi’s only female friend.

Not too long after, she heard knocking on the door.

She recalled what Mo Yesi told her previously and went to open it.

Wei Zheng was standing at the door with a few bags of clothes in his hands. When he saw her, he greeted politely. “Young Madam.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Qiao Mianmian gently nodded at him.

“These are the clothes Young Master got me to buy. Please hand it to him.” Wei Zheng discreetly glanced into the room upon saying that.

He didn’t see Chairman Mo, but he could hear the muffled sound of running water.

When he turned to her again, Qiao Mianmian’s face was red. Wei Zheng couldn’t help but think of it that way.
