Chapter 859: Come With Me Immediately

It was better to make them feel like they were relatives than to think that she was his mistress.

In the future, no one would speculate about their relationship anymore.

Avoiding many rumors.

Moreover, with Bai Yusheng as her “cousin,” she could prevent many people from having designs on her.

She wondered if Bai Yusheng had considered this as well. That was why he told them that she was his cousin.

Soon, Qiao Mianmian’s song started playing.

The group of people flattering her was just being nice on Bai Yusheng’s account.

How would they know if Qiao Mianmian’s singing was good or not?

Hence, they went back to doing their own things.

Even Bai Yusheng continued drinking.

He’d ordered a song for Qiao Mianmian because he was afraid she’d be bored.

But the moment Qiao Mianmian started singing, the noisy room fell silent.

Her voice was pure and clear, and it echoed in the room.

“Three-inch Love” was an ancient song.

The original singer’s voice was already amazing, but the moment Qiao Mianmian opened her mouth, everyone seemed to have forgotten what the original singer’s voice was like.

All they could hear was her voice.

Her voice was very unique and memorable.

Qiao Mianmian’s voice when she sang was different from her usual voice.

Her usual voice sounded soft and cute, and a little childish.

But her singing voice... was flawless.

It was unbelievably perfect.

Even those flattering her were shocked.

They didn’t expect her to sing so well.

What a beautiful voice.

Qiao Mianmian was so engrossed in her singing that she didn’t notice that everyone was looking at her in shock.

It was only after she finished singing that she realized that the room was a little too quiet.

She turned around and saw Bai Yusheng looking at her strangely.

The others in the room were also looking at her.

She felt a little uncomfortable being stared at. She put down the microphone and asked Bai Yusheng softly, “Brother Bai, what’s wrong? Did... I sing too badly and affect you guys?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Bai Yusheng seemed to snap out of his daze when he heard her voice. He looked at her deeply for a few seconds before asking in shock, “Why didn’t you tell me that you can sing?”

“Huh?”

“You sang very well.”

Bai Yusheng’s eyes were filled with excitement. He immediately got someone to pick another song for her.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t reject his request.

Hence, she sang another song.

After she finished singing, she realized that the excitement in his eyes seemed even stronger.

When he stared at Qiao Mianmian, it was as if he was looking at a treasure that had just been unearthed. His eyes were filled with excitement and joy, and he didn’t hide it at all.

“Mianmian, come with me immediately.”

...

Before the gathering ended, Bai Yusheng offered to leave first.

Qiao Mianmian left with him.

She didn’t know what he was going to do, but since Bai Yusheng wanted her to tag along, she could only listen to him.

They left the private room.
