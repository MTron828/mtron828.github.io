Chapter 1393: I Know What I’m Doing

“Sister.” Qiao Chen smiled faintly. “Would you believe me if I said I like it? I won’t be used to it in the beginning, but I’ll get used to it slowly. I know what I’m doing, and I know what my choice means. Actually, how many people can live the life they want in real life?

“You don’t have to worry about me. No matter what life I choose, I won’t mistreat myself. Actually, it’s not necessarily bad to work in the company. Perhaps this life suits me.”

Qiao Mianmian pursed her lips and kept quiet.

She didn’t know how she felt about his decision.

Compared to returning to the Mo family and becoming the precious Young Master of the Mo family, she hoped that her brother could live happily.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t know if it was right for her to bring Qiao Chen back to the Mo Residence.

If she hadn’t brought him back, the Mo family wouldn’t have suspected Qiao Chen’s identity.

Being an ordinary person for the rest of his life and being a rich and powerful young master, which was better for him?

She didn’t know.

But seeing that Qiao Chen wasn’t so happy made her sad.

...

After dinner, the siblings sat on the sofa and chatted.

Qiao Mianmian told Qiao Chen about her relationship with the Bai family.

Qiao Chen was shocked.

After a long while, he smiled mockingly and sighed. “I didn’t expect that you and I aren’t from the Qiao family. The only bloodline in the Qiao family is Qiao Anxin. No, maybe even Qiao Anxin isn’t from the Qiao family.

“Doesn’t that make Dad sad? None of the three children share his blood.”

Qiao Chen had some complaints about Father Qiao.

Father Qiao hadn’t treated him well in the past few years. He rarely visited him in the hospital.

Father Qiao thought that he didn’t have a son, so he went to the orphanage to bring Qiao Chen back.

He adopted Qiao Chen to groom the future successor of the company.

Although Qiao Anxin was his biological daughter, he felt that the company had to be handed over to his son.

Her daughter was going to be married off and become someone else’s.

Before Qiao Chen got sick, he treated him pretty well.

When Qiao Chen suddenly fell sick and had a heart attack, Father Qiao felt that he was crippled.

He was naturally cold to him.

He didn’t ignore it, but he didn’t take it to heart.

As for why he treated Qiao Mianmian well, it was because of his traditional thinking.

Qiao Mianmian was his boss’s daughter, so he had to be loyal to her. Moreover, Qiao Mianmian had been obedient and beautiful since she was young, so he was naturally biased.

“I’m not sure if Qiao Anxin is from the Qiao family. Chen Chen, I’m not speaking up for Dad. It’s just that no matter what, he has done us a favor by raising us.”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t want Qiao Chen’s words to be true. Qiao Ruhai had nurtured her, and even if he did something that made her heart cold, she didn’t want him to live too tragically.

Lin Huizhen’s betrayal was enough to hurt him.

If Qiao Anxin wasn’t of the Qiao family...

“Sister, I know.” Qiao Chen sighed again. “I’ll remember his kindness to us. Alright, let’s not talk about this anymore. Besides me and Brother-in-law, does anyone else know that you’re the daughter of the Bai family?”
