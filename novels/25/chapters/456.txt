Chapter 457: He Didn’t Want to Face It

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

If they did, they’d have revealed it already.

So, he actually only had one issue to settle at this point. Everything else didn’t matter.

Xie Linda’s dismissal happened to clash with this news.

It was fitting to have her bear the responsibility for all that happened. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He caused Qiao Anxin’s miscarriage. The child was never going to return.

The only thing he could do now was to make it up to her.

“Yes, Chairman Su. I’ll head back to the office and settle this immediately. Miss Qiao has a commercial to shoot two days from now. We’ll let them know that Miss Qiao is currently unwell and in need of rest, so she won’t be able to turn up?”

“Mm.” Su Ze nodded. “That will do.”

“So, she will be resting for...”

Su Ze thought about the duration he should set. Qiao Anxin’s miscarriage was a major issue, her body was definitely weakened in the process.

She needed to recuperate well.

“Don’t take up any assignments for her for the rest of the month.”

“Yes, Chairman Su.”

Huo Lin was about to leave once she got his instructions.

But she saw that Su Ze turned around and appeared to be leaving too.

She was slightly stunned and asked, “Chairman Su, you’re leaving?”

Su Ze kept quiet for a few seconds before letting out a soft “mm”.

Huo Lin turned around and glanced at Qiao Anxin’s ward. She hesitated for a while before asking tentatively, “You’re not going to wait for Miss Qiao to wake up?”

Everyone in Star Splendor knew that Su Ze cared a lot about Qiao Anxin.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t have fired Linda, a top-tier manager, just because of her.

But the way he was acting now seemed uncharacteristic of him.

His girlfriend was lying in a hospital bed and hadn’t regained consciousness yet. He was leaving instead of keeping her company?

Su Ze froze for a while but quickly strode off. “No need.”

Qiao Anxin was definitely going to pick a fight with him when she found out that she had a miscarriage.

He didn’t want to face it.

In fact, he was also afraid that she would guilt-trip him with her miscarriage and force him to marry her right away.

He already had some thoughts after his call with Mother Su.

Mother Su was right. He was with Qiao Anxin only because of the child.

Now that the child was gone, he didn’t have to take responsibility for her anymore.

It really was time for him to re-evaluate his relationship and future with Qiao Anxin.

Twinkling Moonlight.

One of Yuncheng City’s most classy and luxurious clubhouses.

A place where rich young men patronized every so often.

It was also a favorite spot for the high society heirs like Yan Shaoqing and Gong Zeli.

Private VIP Room 888 in Twinkling Moonlight was permanently set aside for the richest and most powerful men in Yuncheng City. Even if they weren’t around, the private room was not to be occupied by anyone else.

That was because Twinkling Moonlight was opened by the Gong family.

As the only heir of the Gong family, Young Master Gong Zeli was practically the boss around here.

The doors of the private room were somewhat masked.

Yan Shaoqing entered with a young model in his arms, only to see Gong Zeli gently comforting a weeping Shen Rou.

He was dabbing Shen Rou’s tears off with his handkerchief so tenderly.

His cautiousness and attentiveness almost blinded Yan Shaoqing.

Even the model in his arms was shocked by Gong Zeli’s actions.

Gong Zeli was rather well-known in Yuncheng City.

Practically all the female celebrities and young models in the entertainment industry knew him and Yan Shaoqing.

These two men weren’t just rich and powerful, they were also good-looking and generous.

They were a different league from the grimy old men.

Too many celebrities were dying to get into their good books.
