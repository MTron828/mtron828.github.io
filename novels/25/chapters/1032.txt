Chapter 1035: One Day, He Will Pay Back This Anger

Su Ze didn’t expect to bump into Qiao Mianmian here.

When he saw Qiao Mianmian, the first thing he wanted to do was to look for her. But when he recalled the beating he received at the revolving restaurant, he felt a little afraid.

Su Ze was filled with hatred as he recalled what happened last time.

That man embarrassed him in front of Qiao Mianmian. He wasn’t going to let him off!

He wanted revenge.

But, in the end, considering the Mo family’s power, he gave up on it.

Even if that man was just a side family member of the Mo family, he might be working in the Mo Corporation and holding a high position. He should have a good relationship with the Mo family.

He wasn’t afraid of that man.

But he couldn’t afford to offend the Mo family.

Hence, no matter how unwilling he was, he could only give up on revenge.

But he couldn’t vent his anger.

He felt terrible.

One day, he was going to pay it back.

Su Ze looked around. After confirming that Mo Yesi wasn’t around, he gently pushed her hand away. “Mm, it’s someone I know. Wait for me here, I’ll go say hi to her.”

Seeing that he had no intention of bringing her along, the woman got angry. “Ah Ze, since they’re your friends, aren’t you going to introduce them to me? Is it because you don’t want to introduce me to them because I’ve made you feel bad?”

Su Ze furrowed his brows. He felt like this woman was being unreasonable.

And he hated unreasonable women the most.

But thinking about how they’d only known each other for a short while and how their families were on good terms, he suppressed his discomfort and said, “What nonsense are you talking about? How could you be unpresentable? I just feel that we’re not good friends, so there’s no need to introduce you to them.”

His explanation angered the woman even more.

Not good friends?

Then, why was he staring at her!

He was obviously lying to her!

Did he take her for a fool? Did he really think she couldn’t tell?

“Since you aren’t that close, there’s no need to greet her. Ah Ze, are you hiding something from me? You aren’t friends, is that why you don’t want to introduce us?”

Although they met on a blind date.

But the woman was still very satisfied with Su Ze.

There weren’t many young talents like him in their circle.

Hence, after she confirmed her relationship with Su Ze, she wanted to develop it well.

But after seeing Qiao Mianmian, she felt threatened.

Although she wasn’t sure of Su Ze’s relationship with Qiao Mianmian, his performance just now made her feel threatened.

Once a woman felt threatened, she would only feel secure by doing something.

The woman’s words caused Su Ze’s expression to change. He felt disgusted.

He hated suspicious women the most.

He took a deep breath and said, “Don’t overthink it. It’s not what you think.”

The woman looked at Qiao Mianmian with hostility. “But she looks like her. And why do I feel like I’ve seen her somewhere before?”

Su Ze frowned and was about to say something when he saw Qiao Mianmian and Linda walking in another direction.

He was too anxious to care about his female companion and chased after them.
