Madam Mo would say this in front of her daughter-in-law.

“Mom.” Qiao Mianmian ignored Madam Mo’s sarcasm and looked away from Second Madam. “Why did you call me back?”

Madam Mo couldn’t help but feel angry when she saw how indifferent she was.

She didn’t dare to go overboard because of Old Madam.

Moreover, Qiao Mianmian came back with Mo Yesi.

Madam Mo knew her son’s personality and knew how protective Mo Yesi was of Qiao Mianmian. She couldn’t go overboard in front of Mo Yesi.

But now, Old Madam and Mo Yesi weren’t around.

Madam Mo was fearless.

Her expression darkened as she threw her cell phone to the ground.

Bam!

The steaming coffee spilled all over the floor, and the white porcelain cup shattered.

Even though Qiao Mianmian was a distance away from Madam Mo, she felt the coffee splash on her lap.

The housemaids in the living room, including Uncle Zhang, were shocked by Madam Mo’s sudden action.

Second Madam was also stunned, but her expression quickly returned to normal.

Qiao Mianmian looked down at the spilled coffee and shattered porcelain cup. She was silent for a while before slowly looking up.

She looked at Madam Mo fearlessly.

Madam Mo vented all her anger at this moment.

She looked at Qiao Mianmian coldly and said, “What else do you want me to ask? Qiao Mianmian, are you feigning ignorance? Let me ask you, what’s going on with Qiao Chen?”

Qiao Mianmian said calmly, “I wonder what Mom is referring to.”

“You’re still pretending!” Madam Mo said coldly. “I knew from the first time you brought Qiao Chen home that you were plotting something. I didn’t expect you to be so ambitious. Not only did you think of ways to marry my son, but you even want to arrange for your brother to join our Mo family.

“You found out that your Second Uncle doesn’t have any children, so you wanted your brother to pretend to be of the Mo family’s bloodline. This way, if your plan succeeds, the two of you will successfully squeeze into the upper-class society. If Qiao Chen is recognized by the Mo family, it will establish your status in the family.

“Qiao Mianmian, your plan is really good. It’s just that you used Ah Si and Old Madam’s trust in you to deceive them. Do you think others can be deceived by you? Today, you have to explain to me how you bribed the doctor to do the paternity test.”

At this moment, Second Madam said, “Mianmian, if you’re willing to tell me the truth, I can forgive you this time for Ah Si’s sake.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“You heard that? Yashi already said that, why aren’t you telling the truth!”

Qiao Mianmian guessed that they wanted to talk to her about Qiao Chen, but she didn’t expect them to suspect Qiao Chen’s identity.

They actually thought that she bribed the Mo family’s doctor and faked the paternity test.

She found it funny and was angry, but she still said calmly, “Mom, Second Aunt, I think you heard some nonsense, so you have such a misunderstanding about me. Chen Chen’s paternity test was done by Grandma. Before bringing him back, I didn’t even know that Grandma would do that.”
