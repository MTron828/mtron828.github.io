Chapter 1098: Who Is His Brother-in-law?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

One looked like the father, while the other looked like the mother.

No matter who it was, they could tell that their genes were very good. Their parents must be a combination of handsome men and beautiful women. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

It was just that this younger brother of Second Madam was born very well. His appearance was outstanding, but his complexion did not look good.

He looked sick.

Qiao Chen immediately greeted Uncle Zhang. “Uncle Zhang, hello. I’m Qiao Chen.”

Uncle Zhang couldn’t help but take a few more glances at him. He smiled and said, “The kitchen is already preparing dinner. Is there anything you need to avoid, Mr. Qiao? I’ll get the kitchen staff to pay attention.”

This Mr. Qiao was really similar to Second Young Master.

They looked just like brothers.

However, he felt that if they were to talk about similarities, this Mr. Qiao and their second master were truly alike.

If he was 30% similar to Second Young Master, then he was 70% similar to Second Old Master.

If the Second Master saw him, he would definitely be shocked.

His eyes looked exactly like Second Master’s.

Qiao Chen was a little overwhelmed by Uncle Zhang’s words. He immediately replied, “I can eat anything. I don’t have anything I need to avoid.”

“That’s good.”

Uncle Zhang smiled and turned to Mo Yesi respectfully. “Second Young Master, Madam and Old Madam are already waiting.”

Mo Yesi nodded and looked down at Qiao Mianmian. “Let’s go in, then.”

...

The three of them walked into the hall.

Qiao Chen had thought that what he had seen earlier was enough to shock him.

However, something even more shocking followed.

He looked at the luxurious, palace-like hall and did not come to his senses for a long time.

He had only seen the concept of a mansion on television and in some magazines.

Therefore, he wasn’t sure what a real mansion looked like.

Now he saw it.

It was a much more shocking scene than he had imagined.

The Qiao family was considered a wealthy family in the eyes of ordinary people.

But Qiao Chen felt that his family was really incomparable to his brother-in-law’s family.

They were on completely different levels. Compared to his brother-in-law’s family, the Qiao family was like a slum.

He was especially curious now.

Who exactly was his brother-in-law?

To be rich to such an extent, he definitely had a certain status and power in Yun Cheng.

But why didn’t his sister tell him about his brother-in-law’s identity?

Did his sister not know who his brother-in-law was?

Qiao Chen was already extremely nervous. When he saw the Old Madam and Madam Mo sitting in the living room, he was so nervous that he didn’t even dare to breathe.

He was over 1.8 meters tall, but he was hiding behind Qiao Mianmian. He looked like he wanted to dig a hole and hide himself.

“Mianmian, you’re finally back.”

The moment Qiao Mianmian walked into the hall, she was warmly welcomed by the Old Madam. The servants helped her up.

With the help of the servants, she slowly walked towards Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi.

She didn’t even bother to look at her grandson. She grabbed Qiao Mianmian’s hand and asked about her well-being, “I heard from Ah Si that you went overseas to film. How is it? Are you used to being outside? Are you getting along well with your colleagues? No one bullied you, right?”

The Old Madam didn’t like Qiao Mianmian’s current profession.

But it didn’t really hurt her.

Qiao Mianmian’s looks were the type that elders liked. Madam Mo didn’t like her because of her family background and because of Shen Rou.
