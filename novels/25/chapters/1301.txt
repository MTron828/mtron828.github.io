Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“I’ll tell Second Uncle about his request and get him to arrange a meeting. Actually, Second Uncle wanted to meet him too. Both father and son thought of the same thing.”

“Mo Yesi, can I ask you for a favor?”

“Baby, why are you being so formal with me?” Mo Yesi frowned as if he was unhappy. “Do you still need to ask?”

“Alright, then.” Qiao Mianmian smiled and looked up at him. “Do something for me, alright?”

The man seemed satisfied and nodded. “Go on.”

“Can you arrange for more people to protect Chen Chen?” Qiao Mianmian was still worried. “I’m afraid Second Madam will take action in the next few days.”

Mo Yesi reassured her. “Don’t worry, I’ve already made arrangements. They’re all people who’ve been by my side for many years. They’ll definitely protect Chen Chen.”

Qiao Mianmian was relieved to hear that.

She trusted Mo Yesi. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Since he said it was fine, it was definitely fine.

“Oh right, I’ll go back to pack up later and head to F City.” Qiao Mianmian recalled the WeChat message Bai Yusheng sent her and told Mo Yesi about the shooting restarting tomorrow.

The man frowned. “Why so soon?”

Qiao Mianmian said, “... Not really. I’ve already taken so many days off. I hope we can start filming again soon. Did you know that Brother Bai chose Qin Han as the male lead this time? Qin Han is super amazing. He won three Best Actor awards in just seven years.

“Moreover, he’s one of the more popular ones. He’s good at acting and is handsome. I really like him.

“My dream was to work with him on a television show. I didn’t expect...”

As Qiao Mianmian spoke, she felt the temperature in the car drop.

She turned around.

Beside her, the man’s handsome face was filled with unhappiness. He narrowed his dark eyes and asked her in a dangerous voice, “Qin Han? You like this actor? Your dream was to act with him?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She was too familiar with Mo Yesi’s jealousy.

“I just admire him.” She looked at the man’s furrowed brows and immediately added, “I admire his acting skills. I only admire him at work.”

Qiao Mianmian felt a headache coming on.

He had to mind every actor she worked with.

Why was this man so petty?

He had so many female secretaries around him, but she didn’t mind.

She knew that he wouldn’t have any feelings for them.

Why couldn’t he be more confident and trust her?

“Mm, it’s just a work appreciation.” Mo Yesi smiled, but his coldness didn’t dissipate. “You said he was handsome just now. Baby, how handsome is he?”

The man lifted her chin and looked down at her. “Tell me, who is more handsome, he or me?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

He was so childish!

“Mm?” Mo Yesi’s handsome face came closer, magnified several times in front of her eyes. At this close distance, his eyes became deeper and more charming. “Baby, answer me. Is he handsome, or is your husband handsome?”

“Mo Yesi, you...”

“Call me Hubby,” the man ordered.
