Chapter 2352: It Was Because of Shen Rou

When “If You Can’t Love” was broadcasted two-thirds of the way, all the main actors became the most popular artistes.

The male and female leads, Qin Han and Qiao Mianmian, were even more popular.

Qin Han was the Big Brother, so the so-called “surge in popularity” was not obvious enough.

But Qiao Mianmian’s popularity had changed drastically.

Her fans went from five million to twenty million.

A casual post on Weibo would have tens of thousands of comments.

Then, it was trending almost every day.

For example, she went out for a meal and was captured by the reporters. Soon, she was on the trending list.

Another example was when she went to a job and saw that she was trending again.

Anyway, as long as the reporters took photos of her doing something, she would be trending.

Even Linda couldn’t help but sigh. “Mianmian, I realize that you’re really ‘trending’. It’s not easy for others to be on the trending list, and many of them need the company to spend money to get them on it. Not only are you on it for free, but you’re also on it every day. Not only that, but you’re also in the top three on the trending list. If the company had to spend money, it’d definitely be a huge expenditure. You’ve saved the company a huge sum of money.

“This is the first time I’ve seen someone trending every day. Even Qin Han wasn’t as popular as you.”

Linda was telling the truth.

Qin Han and Qiao Mianmian filmed this show together, but Qiao Mianmian was the most popular.

Linda felt that it was a wise decision to sign Qiao Mianmian.

She didn’t even have to worry about her artiste becoming popular.

She’d definitely gotten a huge bargain.

After all, she knew very well that Qiao Mianmian’s future development would only get better.

She had the Bai and Mo families as her backing. In the future, Qiao Mianmian could do whatever she wanted in the entertainment industry.

Qiao Mianmian was surfing Weibo and realized she was trending again.

And this time, it was because of Shen Rou.

Shen Rou attended a Chamber of Commerce, so reporters must have attended.

The reporters also wanted to create a hot topic, so they deliberately asked about some sensitive topics. They actually asked Shen Rou if she had seen “If You Can’t Love” and asked her how her acting was.

Shen Rou’s answer was: [I just watched a little. I like Qin Han’s acting. It’s not bad.]

The reporters then immediately asked: [What about Qiao Mianmian? Many netizens are praising her acting skills and saying that her role as the female lead is very popular. What do you think?]

Shen Rou’s answer: [To be honest, it’s nothing much. If it wasn’t for Qin Han, I wouldn’t have been able to take it.]

Shen Rou liked Mo Yesi, and Mo Yesi was with Qiao Mianmian now.

Hence, the moment Shen Rou’s interview was released, it immediately became a hot topic of gossip among netizens.

The trending topic was: [Chairman Mo’s old love comments about his new lover’s acting. She claimed it wasn’t good.]

Such a trending topic was naturally eye-catching.

When Qiao Mianmian opened Weibo and saw this trending topic, it was already in second place.

After asking something and not hearing a reply, Linda looked at Qiao Mianmian and saw her staring at her cell phone.
