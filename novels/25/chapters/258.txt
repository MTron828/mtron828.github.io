Chapter 259: Grandma, We’ll Try Our Best

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“So what.” Madam Mo said coldly, “You can always get a divorce after getting married. If she thinks that marriage is the solution to all her future problems, she’s wrong.

“The Mo family doesn’t welcome just anybody!”

She was referring to Qiao Mianmian.

Shen Rou’s eyes flickered, but she didn’t say more.

...

Qiao Mianmian looked at the box from Old Madam and turned towards Mo Yesi hesitantly.

Mo Yesi nodded at her. “This is Grandma’s welcome gift to you, just take it. When my mom married into the family back then, she received a gift too.”

Qiao Mianmian only reached out to receive it when she heard him say that.

She politely said, “Thank you, Grandma.”

She had no idea what was in the box.

And it wasn’t nice to open it right there.

But it must be pretty good stuff.

After all, she’d been longing for a granddaughter-in-law, and she finally had one. Old Madam was in great spirits now, and she was liking Qiao Mianmian more with every passing minute. She grabbed her hand and talked to her for a long while.

Qiao Mianmian had thought that Old Madam would ask about her family and background.

But even till the end of their conversation, Old Madam hasn’t mentioned a word of it.

She simply asked her about her age, her school, and her as an individual.

“Ah Si has always been a good child who never needed us to worry. He’s an opinionated person, and he’s been making most of his decisions on his own since he was 10. Families like ours usually have planned marriages. Previously, his mom had introduced several girls of suitable backgrounds to him, but Ah Si never took interest in any of them.

“We couldn’t possibly force him to like them. But he was also spending too much time in his work and we were starting to worry that this would be it. But look at him now. He’s married. I can finally lift the weight off my shoulders.”

Old Madam was holding Qiao Mianmian’s hand as she exclaimed, “I have trust in my grandson’s judgment. Anyone Ah Si would choose is definitely a good one. Both of you have to live blissfully and try to bear me a great-grandchild as soon as possible.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Old Madam’s teasing smile had Qiao Mianmian blushing right away.

She looked at Mo Yesi helplessly.

But what she didn’t expect was for Mo Yesi to step forward and wrap her in an embrace. He kissed her on her head and smilingly said to Old Madam, “Grandma, we’ll try our best.”

Qiao Mianmian was shaken.

Try their best?!

Her cheeks burned as she looked up and glared at him.

But meeting her glare was the man’s gentle and loving eyes. It was as if everything besides her pretty face faded into the background when he looked at her.

Her heart was pounding wildly.

Meanwhile, Shen Rou, watching it all from the couch opposite them, fumed with anger and bitterness.

Mo Yesi’s gentleness was like a stab to her heart.

She couldn’t even dream of having him treat herself this way.

She could tell that Mo Yesi truly loved Qiao Mianmian.

Initially, she’d deceived herself by thinking that Mo Yesi only married Qiao Mianmian because of that “special reason”.

But could she even go on lying to herself?

Mo Yesi was such a proud man. If he didn’t truly love her, would he go to such lengths?
