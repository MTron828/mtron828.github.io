Chapter 561: He Picked That Woman Himself

He was so serious, it seemed like an “unapproachable” tag was pasted all over him.

It made him even more distant than usual.

Wherever he was walking, people automatically made way for him.

The bodyguard following him placed a few yuan notes on the counter and said to the bartender, “This is for Miss Shen’s drinks.”

Gong Zeli and Yan Shaoqing were frequent patrons of this bar.

A lot of people around here knew them.

But not many of them knew Shen Rou.

Besides those of the high society, a majority of them had no idea who she was.

But as they saw Gong Zeli dragging a woman off, they couldn’t help but get curious.

“Who’s the woman Young Master Gong left with? She’s pretty and charismatic. Is she his new girlfriend?”

“Girlfriend? More like female company. There are so many women around Young Master Gong, but have you ever seen him acknowledge any of them as his girlfriend?”

“That woman looks a little familiar, she doesn’t seem like an online influencer or a celebrity. And I think Young Master Gong’s attitude towards her is different from with the rest of his female companions.”

“Could she really be Young Master Gong’s girlfriend?”

...

Outside the bar.

Gong Zeli got Shen Rou into the car and only let go when he shut the door.

Shen Rou was yelling, “Gong Zeli, are you deaf. I already said I don’t want to go home. Who do you think you are to decide for me.”

She reached for the door handle.

Only to realize that Gong Zeli had locked it.

“Gong Zeli, what are you doing.” Shen Rou turned around and glared at him. “Open the door, I’m getting out.”

“Shen Rou, I should be the one asking you this.”

Gong Zeli took out a pack of cigarettes and put a stick in his mouth. He turned around and looked into her eyes coldly. “What are you doing.”

Shen Rou was stunned. “What do you mean.”

“Ah Si is already married, and he picked that woman himself. You should be very clear that he’s always been sure of his choices. Is there a point in you holding on?

“What you’re doing now will only push him further from you. It’s meaningless.

“Let go, Rourou. You and Ah Si are impossible.”

There was one more thing he couldn’t bear to say to her.

That even if Mo Yesi was unmarried, she still wouldn’t have a chance with him.

Given Mo Yesi’s character, if he really liked a woman, he wouldn’t make her wait this long.

He really had no romantic feelings towards Shen Rou. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

If she went on hounding him, it would only get more awkward.

Shen Rou was always a decisive person who took things in her stride.

It was only with Mo Yesi that she couldn’t be that way.

Seeing how she was, Gong Zeli couldn’t help but get a little upset.

Instead of comforting her like before and saying things that gave her hope, he heartlessly and cruelly told her the hard truths now.

“Accept the truth. Ah Si doesn’t love you, he never did. Even if his wife is someone else in the future and not Qiao Mianmian, it won’t be you. Rourou, you’ve been friends with him for so long, don’t you understand him?

“If he really felt something for someone, he wouldn’t make her wait. But you...”
