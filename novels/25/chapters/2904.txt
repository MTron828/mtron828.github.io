Chapter 2906: She Would Never Give Up!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian stood at the door of the ward and listened to the conversation coming from inside.

She waited for a few minutes before pushing the door open.

Father Qiao turned around.

Seeing Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi at the door, Father Qiao was stunned for a while before getting up happily. “Mianmian, you’re here.”

On the hospital bed.

Qiao Anxin suddenly turned and looked at Qiao Mianmian with lifeless eyes.

It was a look of hatred.

Especially when she saw that Mo Yesi came with Qiao Mianmian, the hatred in her eyes intensified.

That god-like man was not worthy of Qiao Mianmian.

What right did this slut have to marry him!

She hated it. She couldn’t accept it!

“Come, come in and take a seat,” Father Qiao said excitedly. “Anxin has been waiting for you. I told her you’d come.”

“Anxin, look, your sister is here.” Father Qiao turned around and said to Qiao Anxin, who was lying on the hospital bed and staring at Qiao Mianmian with hatred in her eyes. “Your sister is here to see you.”

Qiao Mianmian wanted to correct Father Qiao that she wasn’t Qiao Anxin’s sister.

She had nothing to do with her.

But after thinking about it, she held back.

Father Qiao must be upset by Qiao Anxin’s current situation, so she shouldn’t bother too much about it.

There was nothing to fuss about with a dying person.

Qiao Mianmian walked into the ward with Mo Yesi.

The smell of disinfectant filled the air. Qiao Mianmian walked to the bed and stopped. She looked down at Qiao Anxin, whose face was as pale as a ghost.

Qiao Anxin looked up.

The moment their eyes met, Qiao Anxin’s eyes filled with intense hatred. Even Mo Yesi, who was beside Qiao Mianmian, felt it.

He tightened his arms around Qiao Mianmian’s waist and subconsciously pulled her into his arms in a defensive gesture.

Qiao Anxin felt as if her heart was being stabbed.

It hurt even more than when Su Ze stabbed her. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Ha, was Mo Yesi afraid that she would do something to Qiao Mianmian?

Was he so guarded against her?

Did he care so much about Qiao Mianmian?

“Qiao Anxin, I’m here.” Qiao Mianmian at Qiao Anxin for a few seconds before she looked away. “Dad said you wanted to see me, so I’m here. If you have anything to say to me, you can say it now.”

Qiao Anxin’s resentful gaze landed on Mo Yesi’s hand on Qiao Mianmian’s waist. She stared at it for a while before looking away.

Her eyes were already lifeless.

But when she looked back at Qiao Mianmian, her eyes were filled with hatred.

“Qiao Mianmian, you, you’re finally here.” She opened her mouth and spoke with difficulty as if every word was draining her life.

But even so, she gritted her teeth..
