Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

From the time Song Fei participated in the talent show until now, photos of every period were posted. They were even enlarged. The parts of Song Fei’s body that had undergone plastic surgery were analyzed. Even her project was posted clearly.

It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that Song Fei had changed her appearance.

Because her face had clearly undergone plastic surgery.

When she first participated in the talent show, she had a single eyelid, but now it was double eyelids.

Although her nose wasn’t flat, it wasn’t very upright.

Now, Song Fei’s nose was tall and straight. Her nose had also shrunk a lot. Compared to before, it was small and exquisite. It could be considered a successful nose.

Her lips were also pouted, so she looked full and bouncy.

Her face was different from before. In the past, her face was a little square, but now, it was the standard oval face. It was obvious that she underwent bone-splitting surgery.

Everyone knew about Song Fei’s plastic surgery.

She had changed so much.

Some changes couldn’t be achieved without plastic surgery.

For example, her face shape, her nose…

Even Shen Fei’s chest and buttocks were exposed.

She used to have a flat chest and a flat butt.

But her figure was very curvy.

Song Fei was an idol.

She wasn’t very popular, but it wasn’t that bad.

This post attracted a lot of attention.

Many netizens saw it.

“Song Fei’s plastic surgery was too hardcore. If she hadn’t done it herself, her own mother wouldn’t have recognized her.”

“She was just an ordinary passerby during the audition, but now she’s a beautiful girl. Plastic surgery can really change a person’s life.”

“Isn’t Song Fei’s plastic surgery known to everyone? Anyone with eyes can tell. Why is there such news now?”

“Explain it to the netizens who are still unclear about the situation. It seems like Song Fei’s fans and Qiao Mianmian’s fans fought. Song Fei’s fans said that Qiao Mianmian had plastic surgery, and that’s why this news came out. But one of them is from the music industry, and the other is from the film industry. They don’t know each other, so how could they fight?” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“I’ll explain it to you. It was Song Fei who started it. When Song Fei’s fans praised her, a passerby said that she felt that Qiao Mianmian was prettier, thus angering Song Fei’s fans.”

“Song Fei’s fans are so domineering. Everyone’s aesthetics are different. Why can’t they allow others to think that other female celebrities are prettier? I’ve long heard that Song Fei’s fans are very good at tearing people apart. In the past, they only tore at those who weren’t as popular as Song Fei. I didn’t expect them to even dare to try this on someone like Qiao Mianmian. Do they not know who Qiao Mianmian is? Do they think that she’s like the female artistes they’ve torn apart in the past, so easy to bully?”

“To be fair, I think Qiao Mianmian is much prettier than Song Fei. Her looks are natural. Song Fei’s looks are clearly unnatural..”
