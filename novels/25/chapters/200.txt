Chapter 201: But Why Was She Sad?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Really!” Qiao Mianmian smiled as if she really did not mind it. “You already explained your reason. I understand.”

“Baby, you’re the most important to me. Don’t let your thoughts run wild. Your place in my heart hasn’t changed at all, and I won’t get a divorce with you over this. Don’t you think about divorce ever again.

“As for Chen Chen, you don’t have to worry. When the time is right, I’ll arrange for his surgery.”

“Mm.”

Qiao Mianmian nodded again. “I got it.”

Mo Yesi eyed her for a while more, still a little worried. “You really believe all that I said?”

“Mm, I really do.”

“You won’t overthink this?”

“Mm, I won’t.”

“You’re not lying to me?”

“I’m not!”

“Alright, then.” He heaved a sigh of relief and patted her on the head, before leaving her another kiss. “I’ll head to the study, then?”

“Mm, go on.”

Mo Yesi tenderly said, “Isn’t Chen Chen being discharged tomorrow? I happen to be free tomorrow, we can go and pick him up together.”

Qiao Mianmian nodded. “Mm, the doctor said he can be discharged tomorrow.”

Mo Yesi smiled again. “When he’s out, let’s throw him a celebration.”

“Sure.”

...

Mo Yesi seemed to be very afraid that she’d be upset over it. He chatted with her for a bit more until he sensed that she was really fine, before finally leaving for the study.

Once the bedroom door closed, Qiao Mianmian’s smile vanished.

She adjusted her clothes neatly and remained seated against the bed frame for a long time.

As she guessed, he did despise her for it.

Although he had comforted her through and through, it was obvious that he wouldn’t have stopped his act midway if he hadn’t despised her. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

He’d made his desire for her so clear in the first place.

So, it did make sense that he despised her for it.

She... wasn’t clean anymore anyway.

She’d been assaulted by a man she didn’t even recognize. It was normal that he was worried about engaging in the act with her.

It was all within her expectations.

It was all logical.

The only thing that surprised her was that she was actually sad.

She’d thought she wouldn’t be bothered by it at all.

But why was she sad?

...

书房.

Mo Yesi stood at the full-length windows.

Behind it was the dark night sky, and the moonlight that shone in.

He frowned slightly while sipping some red wine. After a few moments of hesitation, he made a call.

The call was picked up immediately.

He could hear hints of playfulness in the other party’s voice. “Second Bro, you used to not have a sex life, so I could understand when you called me in the middle of the night. But now you’re married, why are you taking this precious time of the night to call your buddy instead of spending it with your wife? Did something happen in the midst of it, so you’re turning to me? If so, then you’ve got the right person.”

Mo Yesi said, “If you continue speaking like that, I’ll pay Old Master Yan a visit tomorrow to remind him to look out for your marriage.”

Yan Shaoqing replied, “... Damn!

“Um, well, Second Bro, I was just kidding with you. You don’t have to be so petty! So, what’s so urgent that you’re calling me now?”
