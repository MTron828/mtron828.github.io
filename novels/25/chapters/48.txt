Chapter 49: Are You Really My Savior?

“If you need anything more, just speak up. Someone will get it prepared for you.”

Qiao Mianmian went quiet.

Everything was gotten ready for her?

Why did she feel like... he’d been planning to have her move over since a long time back?

On the road.

Qiao Mianmian fell asleep in the car.

She was leaning against the car window, but it seemed like an uncomfortable position, given how she would furrow her brows occasionally.

There were a few moments in which her head knocked against the window with a “bang”.

Mo Yesi was settling a few emails in his notebook.

He turned around when he heard the sounds.

Seeing the sleeping beauty, he closed his notebook, rubbed his temple, and whispered, “Uncle Li, drive a little slower.”

“Yes, Young Master.”

Mo Yesi put the notebook aside and reached out to shift the girl who was still asleep. He placed her head on his lap instead.

He then draped his outer suit over her.

Her fringe would slide and cover her eyes once in a while.

Each time it happened, he would sweep her fringe aside and look at her for a few seconds, sometimes stroking her face gently.

“Mianmian...”

As his slender fingers brushed past her face, he looked at her expectantly. Quietly, he murmured, “Lu Rao said that you’d be my savior. Are you really my savior?”

Uncle Li happened to witness the entire scene and was so shocked that he momentarily lost control of the black Rolls-Royce and almost hit a divider.

He broke out in cold sweat as he regained control of the wheel.

Mo Yesi paused in his movements, looked up, and said in his deep voice, “Be careful.”

“Y-Yes, Young Master.”

Uncle Li wiped the sweat on his forehead and dared not get distracted again.

An hour later.

The black Rolls-Royce drove into a luxurious mansion.

The sturdy bronze door opened slowly and the security officer got up to bow at the passengers in the car.

Tall parasol trees were grown on both sides of the road, the large area of turf was well maintained and neat, and the Rolls-Royce came to a stop beside a fountain.

Once the car was parked, Uncle Li got off and opened the back door.

Mo Yesi alighted and Lei En, the butler, came up instantly. Lei En bowed a full 90 degrees and politely greeted. “Good evening, Young Master.”

“Mm.”

Mo Yesi nodded slightly before turning back to the car and carrying Qiao Mianmian—who was still soundly asleep—out.

Lei En widened his eyes in disbelief when he saw Qiao Mianmian. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

He looked as if someone just told him that Doomsday was arriving.

Was he seeing things?!

Young Master was carrying... a woman?!

He got a huge shock.

He turned around and looked at Uncle Li, asking for an explanation with his expression.

Uncle Li returned him a look that said: Yup, it’s exactly what it looks like.

Lei En went quiet.

He even felt unwell.

What a terrible scare it was.

He did receive a call from Young Master earlier this morning, getting him to purchase some feminine products and daily necessities.

Back then, he hadn’t thought much about it. He assumed that either Madam or Old Madam would be coming over for a short period.

Who knew that this woman was neither Madam nor Old Madam! It was the woman in Young Master’s arms!!
