Chapter 917: Does He Have Time to Date?

“Mr. Mo, you don’t have to apologize to me.” Jiang Luoli felt that she had to make things clear to him. “I’ve said it before, I was willing to do it that night. You didn’t force me. Since it’s a matter of mutual consent, you have nothing to be sorry about.

“I’ve already seen Mr. Mo’s sincerity. If you really feel like you owe me and can make it up to me to make you feel better, I’ll consider the compensation seriously when I get back.

“But now, I really haven’t thought of what I need.”

Jiang Luoli now knew why Mo Shixiu wanted to see her.

This man had a strong sense of responsibility and some traditions.

He felt that he had taken away her first time and suffered a loss, so he wanted to make it up to her.

In his mind, even if she was willing to do it, she was still a woman and would be at a disadvantage in such matters.

After knowing his thoughts, she didn’t reject his so-called compensation.

Since he wanted to make it up to her so much, she’d let him.

She nodded.

As expected, Mo Shixiu smiled when he saw that she agreed. “Alright, Miss Jiang, you can think about it when you get back. You can contact me anytime if you’re ready.”

He picked up his cell phone.

After a while, Jiang Luoli heard her cell phone ring.

She took it out and saw that it was an unknown number.

The ringtone went off after two rings.

Mo Shixiu looked at her and said, “Miss Jiang, this is my private cell phone number. I might be a little busy in a few days. If you call me, I won’t pick it up immediately. I hope you don’t mind. I’ll call you when I’m free.”

Jiang Luoli’s heart skipped a beat when she heard that it was his private number.

She looked into the man’s deep and cold eyes and tried her best to ignore the strong and fast heartbeat. She said calmly, “Alright, I got it.”

She knew how busy Mo Shixiu was.

The entire country knew that he was a busy man.

Jiang Luoli couldn’t imagine how a man like Mo Shixiu would look like when he had a girlfriend.

Did he have the time to date?

“In any case, even if I didn’t pick up your call back then, I’ll definitely reply to you when I see your call.”

“Mm.”

“Miss Jiang, I apologize again for what happened that night.”

Jiang Luoli was a little helpless. “Mr. Mo, didn’t I say that you didn’t do anything to let me down? I hope you won’t apologize to me again, alright?”

“Alright.” Mo Shixiu smiled. “I won’t say anymore. We won’t talk about this anymore.”

With that, he looked at the time on his watch and hesitated for a while before looking at Jiang Luoli hesitantly. “Miss Jiang, how about staying for dinner?” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

At this moment, Sister Lin walked over and smiled at Jiang Luoli. She walked towards Mo Shixiu and said respectfully, “Mister, dinner is ready. Do you want to eat now?”

Mo Shixiu asked for Jiang Luoli’s opinion. “Miss Jiang, do you want to join us?”

“Miss Jiang, just have your dinner first.” Sister Lin didn’t wait for Jiang Luo to leave before walking over. She held her hand affectionately and said, “Mister doesn’t usually have any visitors. We’ve waited for so long and finally managed to get Miss Jiang here. You can’t just leave like this.”
