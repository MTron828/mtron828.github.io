Mo Yesi held her hand and said, “Baby, let’s go. You’ve been with your best friend for so long, I’m sure you’ve said what you needed to say. Let’s not stay here to be third wheels and disturb Big Brother and her.”

Jiang Luoli blushed.

Mo Shixiu smiled faintly. He walked towards Jiang Luoli and reached out a hand. “I’ve ordered a dress for you. Go and try it on.”

Jiang Luoli was still hesitating when Mo Shixiu bent down and grabbed her hand.

Jiang Luoli was stunned.

She looked up in surprise.

Mo Shixiu looked calm, but his eyes were gentle. He looked at her and asked, “What’s wrong?”

Jiang Luoli bit her lip and saw that Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi were still around. She blushed again.

She shook her head and got up. “Nothing. Why are you back so early? I thought I’d have to wait for another hour or two.”

“Mm, it ended early,” Mo Shixiu said naturally as if he didn’t see anyone else in the room. “I didn’t want you to wait for too long.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Jiang Luoli blushed.

She didn’t expect Mo Shixiu to be so good at sweet-talking girls.

And in front of everyone.

Qiao Mianmian smiled.

She was worried that Mo Shixiu was too boring and didn’t know how to coax girls. She was afraid that Jiang Luoli would feel bored with him.

Now, she felt that she was overthinking.

She realized that the men from the Mo family were more passionate than the others.

Mo Yesi and Mo Shixiu had never been in a relationship before. Back then, she thought that Mo Yesi didn’t know how to interact with women and must be very clumsy in relationships. But she underestimated him.

He had never been in a relationship before, but he was born to do it.

Sweet words came easily.

He often teased her.

Hence, the men in the Mo family were probably the same.

They were all born with love skills?

Mo Yesi and Mo Shixiu were the same.

Her previous worries were unnecessary.

“Baby, I’ve prepared a gown for you too. You want to try it on?” Mo Yesi smiled and looked at his Big Brother, then at Jiang Luoli, and then walked out of the room with Qiao Mianmian in his arms.

After they left, Qiao Mianmian closed the bedroom door.

...

After Qiao Mianmian got into the car with Mo Yesi, she recalled what happened just now and couldn’t help but sigh. “I really didn’t expect Big Brother to know how to make girls happy. Mo Yesi, are all the men in the Mo family like this?”

“What?” Mo Yesi smiled and looked at the woman beside him affectionately.

“It’s just a natural technique.”

“Self-talking?” Mo Yesi raised an eyebrow. “Is this a compliment?”

“Mm, I guess.” Qiao Mianmian nodded.

“I don’t know if it’s natural.” Mo Yesi smiled. “But I know that the men of the Mo family only activate this skill when they meet the person they’re destined to be with.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

This invisible man.

Her heart started racing again.
