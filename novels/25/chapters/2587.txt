Chapter 2588: Untitled

“Yes, my friend has been with Qiao Mianmian for a while. She’s just a small fry, but Qiao Mianmian would invite the crew for afternoon tea every time. She also told me that Qiao Mianmian has a good personality and is rather popular with the crew. Everyone likes her.”

With the support of Zhan Bo and Qin Han and the announcement from the Golden Globe Awards, so many artistes expressed their opinions.

Soon, the public opinion was reversed.

Actually, many people had spoken up for Qiao Mianmian before.

But they couldn’t beat Little Xiao’s fake review team.

Even if someone spoke up for her, the comments were quickly drowned out by the malicious slander of the Internet Water Army.

The comment section was filled with comments.

With a professional team of Internet Water Army, how could a few netizens turn the situation around?

But it was different now.

After Wei Zheng found out who was behind this, the Mo Corporation’s public relations team quickly resolved this matter. In less than five minutes, all of Qiao Mianmian’s negative trending topics were removed.

The related topics were also deleted.

As for the fake reviewers, they were already scared out of their wits after the Mo Corporation’s legal team sent the lawyer’s letter.

Without the manipulation of the Internet Water Army, public opinion was quickly taken over by the real netizens.

The haters were the minority.

Qiao Mianmian was at her peak and had a lot of fans.

Some netizens who were led by the haters and believed in the trending topic slowly regained their rationality and realized that they had made a wrong judgment.

Hence, Qiao Mianmian’s negative news was settled.

She was trending again.

But it was no longer trending on negative news.

# All the stars support the Golden Globe Awards and indirectly support Qiao Mianmian #

Qiao Mianmian scrolled through Weibo, thinking that this matter was over.

But half an hour later, she received the latest news on Weibo.

Little Xiao issued an apology.

Qiao Mianmian clicked on it and saw that Little Xiao had sent her an apology letter.

She said she was the one who made Qiao Mianmian trending.

She was the one who got the Internet Water Army to spread the news. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

She felt indignant that Qiao Mianmian had taken her spot. Hence, she wanted to find someone to defame Qiao Mianmian and vent her anger.

Jealousy blinded her rationality and made her do those bad things on impulse.

At the end of the statement, she apologized to Qiao Mianmian sincerely and said that she knew she was in the wrong. She had let Qiao Mianmian down, and she didn’t expect Qiao Mianmian to forgive her. She had done such a terrible thing, and she had let down the trust and love of her fans, as well as the masses who had been deceived by her.

She was a sinner.

An artiste with bad morals like her wasn’t suitable to stay in the entertainment industry.

Hence, she decided to leave the industry.

From then on, her Little Xiao left the entertainment industry and would never enter it again.

“Goodbye to those who like me and to those who don’t. You might see me somewhere else in the future..”
