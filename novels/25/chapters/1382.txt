Only Mo Yesi’s back view could be seen in the photo, and the person who took it must have been very nervous because the photo was blurred.

But no matter how blurry the photo was, they could still see Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi holding hands.

Mo Yesi was very tall, and Qiao Mianmian looked very cute beside him.

The two of them looked no different from an ordinary couple.

They went shopping for ice cream and watched a movie together. It was just a simple matter, but it was especially sweet.

It was normal for ordinary people.

But in the eyes of many, a rich, powerful, and outstanding man was willing to do such trivial things with you.

Rich people were precious.

Most things that could be solved with money wouldn’t take time.

Soon, another netizen revealed that they’d met Qiao Mianmian and her boyfriend at a hot pot restaurant.

At that time, they wanted to ask for Qiao Mianmian’s boyfriend’s contact details, but he directly showed them the small leather rope on his wrist.

The girl who exposed it said, “I thought that such a good man would be especially blissful with any girl. I didn’t expect it to really be Qiao Mianmian. I can testify that Qiao Mianmian’s boyfriend is really super handsome. I thought he was a celebrity.”

At once, the topic of “Qiao Mianmian’s boyfriend” pushed her to the top of the trending list.

Qiao Mianmian was still unaware of this.

When she and Mo Yesi finished watching the movie and came out, they were surrounded by a group of young girls.

Mo Yesi’s first reaction was to pull Qiao Mianmian into his arms and protect her.

His actions caused the girls to exclaim in shock. Then, they looked envious.
