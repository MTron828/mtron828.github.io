Chapter 2403: It Can Only Be Me!

“Qiao Chen.” Shen Xin was silent for a while before giving him an apologetic look. “I just want to focus on my studies. I’m not in the mood to think about anything else for now.”

Qiao Chen was stunned.

This sentence sounded especially familiar.

He suddenly found it funny.

That was what he said when he rejected Shen Xin. He said that he only wanted to study hard and not think about anything else.

He didn’t expect her to use such a reason to reject him.

But he wasn’t disappointed.

He’d thought that if Shen Xin didn’t agree to it, he’d keep chasing her.

She used to chase him like this too, but now it was his turn.

He was a little happy.

Shen Xin’s answer meant that she was still single, which made him feel more at ease.

“You can reject me, but I still have the right to pursue you.” Qiao Chen acted like a rascal. “It’s fine if you don’t accept me, I’ll pursue you. When you want a boyfriend, I hope that I’ll be the first person you consider.”

Another voice in his heart said domineeringly: It can only be me! You’re not allowed to consider other guys besides me!

Shen Xin: “…”

Why did Qiao Chen’s words sound so familiar?

Wasn’t this what she said to him when she pestered him?

But now… the tables had turned?

Qiao Chen became the past her, and she became the past Qiao Chen? Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Shen Xin felt that this was too unreal.

She wanted to tell Qiao Chen that they wouldn’t be in the same place in the future. He would slowly forget her.

Based on his current situation, he was definitely going to study overseas. His grades were randomly chosen from top universities overseas.

The Mo family would definitely send him overseas.

And her university was in China.

The two of them would be separated from each other in the future. As time passed, everything faded.

But she didn’t say anything.

“Qiao Chen, when are you going for the surgery?” Shen Xin changed the topic.

“Probably in the next two days.” Qiao Chen didn’t say that he delayed it because of the class reunion.

Otherwise, he would have already undergone surgery.

“Can I visit you at the hospital?” she asked.

“Of course you can.” Qiao Chen smiled. “I’ll be very happy if you do.”

The young man said this with his clear and black eyes fixed on her.

He blushed.

He seemed embarrassed, but his eyes were fixed on Shen Xin.

He no longer hid his true feelings. His eyes were full of love for her.

Shen Xin’s heart pounded. She felt as if the young man’s eyes could steal her soul.
