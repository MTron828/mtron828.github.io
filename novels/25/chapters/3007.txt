Chapter 3008 Mo Yesi Is a Beast

Mother Bai couldn’t wait to have a grandchild.

“Alright, alright, I’ll go look for it right away. Old He gave me two-hundred-year-old ginseng previously, I’ll take it out to nourish Mianmian’s body!”

Although Father Bai wasn’t as anxious to have a grandchild as Mother Bai, he was still very happy that his daughter was pregnant.

Mother Bai next called Bai Yusheng happily. When the call went through, she said happily, “Yusheng, your sister is pregnant. You’re going to be an uncle!”

On the other side, Bai Yusheng was filming a new movie.

During the intermission, his assistant handed him a glass of water. He took it and almost dropped the glass when he heard Mother Bai’s news.

“Mianmian is pregnant?” Bai Yusheng handed the glass to his assistant and stood up to better answer the call.

“Yes, she just called me. She’s already been checked at the hospital.” Mother Bai couldn’t hide her joy. “Your dad and I will go over to see her later.”

Bai Yusheng knew that Mother Bai had been looking forward to this grandchild, but he wasn’t as happy to hear this good news.

It was hard to describe his feelings.

He wasn’t unhappy, but he felt that Mo Yesi was a beast.

His sister was still so young, but she was about to be a mother.

This feeling was like a cabbage being eaten by a pig.

Bai Yusheng actually didn’t approve of Qiao Mianmian giving birth too early. Qiao Mianmian was talented in acting. She could have taken advantage of her youth and worked hard in her career. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

But getting married too early and having children would definitely affect her career.

But so what if he didn’t agree?

He couldn’t care less if his sister was willing.

“Mm. Then, I’ll take the time to go home in a few days. Since Mianmian is pregnant, Mom, you can go over and take care of her. Ah Si usually works, and she’s bored at home alone. You can take care of her food and accommodation, and you can accompany her.” “I think so, too.” Madam Bai smiled. “I wonder if I will affect their lives.”

“What effect can you have? If they want to be lovey-dovey, just close the door.” Bai Yusheng didn’t want Mo Yesi to lead a comfortable life.

Mother Bai’s moving there naturally would have some impact.

Bai Yusheng’s suggestion was intentional. Mother Bai then asked about his relationship as usual. “Oh right, how’s your progress with Little Shen? She hasn’t been home for a while. Did something happen to your relationship?

“Let me tell you, Little Shen is a very good girl. Your dad and I like her very much. We’ve already decided that she’s the Bai family’s daughter-in-law. If you ruin our daughter-in-law, your dad and I won’t let you

off!”

Bai Yusheng was speechless.

“She went overseas to study.” Bai Yusheng reached out to massage his temples. He took a deep breath and tried to keep his tone calm. “Mom, I know you like her and hope that our relationship will end well. But it’s hard to say about our relationship. I…”

“What do you mean? Did you really have a conflict with Little Shen?” On the other side, Mother Bai sounded anxious.
