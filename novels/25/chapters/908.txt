Chapter 909: You’re Too Different From Him

As they chatted, they reached the lobby.

Sister Lin glanced at the gym and gestured for Jiang Luoli to take a seat first. “Miss Jiang, have a seat first. What would you like to drink? I’ll prepare it for you.”

Jiang Luoli looked around and didn’t see anyone but the housemaid.

Sister Lin looked at her and smiled. “Mister is in the gym, he’ll be out soon. He has a habit of working out every day, and the time is fixed. What does Miss Jiang like to drink? Tea, coffee, or something else?”

The gym?

Jiang Luoli looked away. No wonder that man had such a good figure. He worked out every day.

She replied to Sister Lin casually, and Sister Lin went to prepare coffee for her.

Assistant Xu stood by the sofa, looking at her unhappily.

He really couldn’t understand why Sir wanted to meet this woman.

He hadn’t intended to see her at first.

Mister’s face would often appear on news and current affairs.

As long as Jiang Luoli saw him, she would definitely recognize him.

By then, he really wouldn’t be able to shake her off.

If it was any other woman, they would definitely cling to him after finding out that the man they had a moment with was the Minister.

Which woman wouldn’t like a man like the minister?

He fit the criteria of a woman’s dream lover.

Which woman would be willing to break off their relationship with such a man?

The minister was making trouble for himself.

He had already given her the money and compensated her. What was the point of meeting her?

There was no need!𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

But he was just an assistant, he couldn’t stop the minister from making any decisions.

No matter how much he disagreed with it, he couldn’t change anything.

“Hmph. Miss Jiang, Mister will be here soon. Before that, I have to remind you, don’t think that the night you had with Mister is very special. That was just a very ordinary night for Mister.

“Sir can’t possibly think that you’re so different from the rest just because of what happened that night. Your relationship with him can’t change at all. Since you accepted the money, you should know that Sir has never thought of developing a relationship with you.

“In any case, don’t have any hopes for Mister. Your status is too different from his, it’s impossible for you two.”

Jiang Luoli rolled her eyes again.

Assistant Xu looked at her and snorted. “You’re too arrogant. A woman like you can’t possibly catch his eye. If it wasn’t for the special situation that night, Sir wouldn’t have touched you at all.

“It was an accident that night, it can’t happen a second time.”

At first, he thought that Jiang Luoli was trying to get close to Mo Shixiu.

Jiang Luoli’s appearance was too coincidental.

She appeared not long after Mo Shixiu was drugged.

He couldn’t help but suspect that she did it on purpose.

But he did a thorough check.

The investigation concluded that Jiang Luoli was indeed there by accident, and no one had deliberately arranged it.

This result made Assistant Xu very unhappy.

He still believed that Jiang Luoli was a scheming woman.

Jiang Luoli couldn’t be bothered to respond to him. This time, she didn’t even bother to roll her eyes. She just turned her head and pretended that he didn’t exist.
