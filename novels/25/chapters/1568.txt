Chapter 1569: Good Looks, Acting Skills, and Resources

The man who came out to pick Qiao Mianmian up was the director’s assistant, Xiao Lin.

Xiao Lin walked over and handed a stack of papers to Qiao Mianmian. “Take one and act according to what’s written on it. Perform for five minutes.”

Qiao Mianmian looked at the stack of papers and randomly picked one out.

She looked down and saw a plot on the piece of paper.

It was a scene of the female protagonist crying after losing her family and lover.

Five minutes wasn’t a lot of time.

She didn’t even have much time to gather her emotions.

Qiao Mianmian quickly memorized the lines and heard the director ask, “Are you ready?”

“Yes, Director. I’m ready.”

Qiao Mianmian felt that she was lucky today.

The performance was actually her best crying scene.

It might be a little difficult for others to cry on the spot.

But to her, this was definitely not difficult.

Even Bai Yusheng once said that her most attractive scene was her crying scene.

Hence, crying was Qiao Mianmian’s forte.

“Alright, let’s begin,” the director said.

Shen Fei retreated to the side.

Qiao Mianmian stood in the middle of the audition hall. She took a deep breath and closed her eyes. When she opened them again, her tears fell.

Her expression changed.

In just a few seconds, her eyes were filled with pain and despair.

She collapsed to the ground.

“Why, why, God, why are you so cruel?” Qiao Mianmian, no, it should be said that the female lead, Bai Yan, screamed at the top of her lungs. “Why do you have to take away all the people I care about? Why are you so cruel to me?

“Father, Mother, Brother Shangguan, why didn’t you take Yan’er with you? Yan’er is in so much pain. Yan’er doesn’t want to stay in this world and suffer alone. Without you, what’s the point of me living in this world?

“Why didn’t you bring me along? Why...”

Tears rolled down her cheeks.

When she looked up again, her face was pale and her whole body was shaking. Her sorrowful expression was so infectious that it tugged the heart. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

They could really feel her pain.

The director and scriptwriter looked at each other in admiration.

Even Shen Fei nodded. Qin Han had good taste.

This girl’s performance was really magical and infectious.

She didn’t look like a newcomer at all.

Her acting was even better than many seniors.

Just as Qin Han said, this girl was going to be popular.

She had looks, acting skills, and resources.

It was hard not to be popular.

Like Qin Han, Shen Fei had helped her juniors before.

Of course, it had to be the younger generation they admired.

If they met someone that they felt was good, they would help them whenever they could.

They were all newbies and had met seniors who were willing to guide them.

After saying the last line, Bai Yan wiped her tears and picked up a sword from the ground.
