Chapter 1800: It’s No Big Deal

Qiao Anxin saw that Zhan Bo was actually helping Qiao Mianmian and couldn’t help but scold the vixen in her heart. But deep down, she was jealous that Qiao Mianmian had such good luck with the opposite sex.

She didn’t know what was wrong with these men.

Why were they all helping Qiao Mianmian?

What was so good about her? Any man would lose their soul when they saw her.

Couldn’t they tell that she was just a slut?

She was always flirting with men. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Or did men just like this sort of green tea b*tch?

The little slut only had a foxy face. What else was attractive about her?

These men were too superficial.

Did they like her just because of her face?

Was appearance really that important?

Qiao Anxin’s gaze landed on Qiao Mianmian’s fair and exquisite face once again. Jealousy flashed in her eyes as an idea flashed through her mind.

If... she also had Qiao Mianmian’s good looks.

Could she be like her, able to make many good men like her?

If she could become prettier than Qiao Mianmian, would Mo Yesi fall for her too?

If she could become Mo Yesi’s woman, she would be able to get whatever she wanted.

If she could become Mo Yesi’s woman...

The more Qiao Anxin thought about it, the more excited she got.

Opposite her, Qiao Mianmian could feel Qiao Anxin looking at her. She looked up and saw that her eyes were sparkling as if she was thinking about something.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She couldn’t be bothered with Qiao Anxin.

Anyway, if Qiao Anxin dared to mess around with her again, she’d just teach her a lesson.

In her eyes, Qiao Anxin was just a clown. If she could be obedient in the future, nothing would happen between them.

Although she couldn’t be her sister anymore, she wouldn’t deliberately target her.

But if Qiao Anxin didn’t know what was good for her and insisted on causing trouble for her, Qiao Mianmian decided that she wouldn’t let her off easily no matter what Father Qiao said.

The so-called friendship could only be used once.

Looking at Song Ke’s stiff expression, Qiao Mianmian resisted the urge to laugh and sent Zhan Bo a WeChat message.

Mianmian: [Handsome guy, thank you for just now.]

On the way, Zhan Bo asked for her WeChat ID and Qiao Mianmian gave it to him.

Zhan Bo’s WeChat nickname was: Low-key Little Zhan.

Low-key Little Zhan: [It’s no big deal. We’re teammates who fought together in the jungle. I have to return whoever bullied my teammate. Actually, I wanted to say that she gained 5kg, but I was afraid that it would be bad if she cried, so I restrained myself.]

Mianmian: [It’s better to leave some room for improvement.]

Low-key Little Zhan: [Mm, I think so too. It’s such a huge blow. How are we going to deal with it later? Let’s take it slow.]

Mianmian: [...]

She realized that Zhan Bo looked like a harmless and arrogant idol.

But in private...

He didn’t match his appearance and the side he showed to his fans.

...

Perhaps it was because of Zhan Bo’s blow, but not only did Song Ke not eat again, but she also didn’t say a word throughout.
