Chapter 1655: Mianmian, How Are You Going to Reply?

At that moment, Qiao Mianmian seemed to have returned to the time when she was embroiled in scandals and was scolded by the netizens.

Qiao Mianmian knew that she was on the hot searches again, and it was because she got the second female role in the movie. She was on her way to the party.

After the filming ended, Bai Yusheng invited the entire crew out for dinner.

She was in the same car as Bai Yusheng.

Nana was the first to find out about it. After looking at it for a while, she handed her the cell phone angrily.

“Mianmian, your stepsister is defaming you online again,” Nana said angrily. “Isn’t she saying that you got the role through connections?”

As Qiao Mianmian’s assistant, Nana knew that Qiao Mianmian didn’t get the role because of her connections.

But Qiao Anxin’s post practically confirmed it.

Coupled with Song Lu’s Weibo post, Qiao Mianmian looked more guilty. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“And that Song Lumo, what does she mean? Is she saying that you stole her role?

“She and Qiao Anxin are in cahoots. Did they agree to deal with you?”

Qiao Mianmian took the cell phone and looked at it for a while with a calm expression.

She wasn’t surprised that Qiao Anxin would do such a thing.

As for Song Lu, Qiao Mianmian felt that there was nothing to be angry about.

As a newbie, she couldn’t believe that she could get the second female role.

Song Lu probably really thought that she snatched her role.

“Mianmian, how are you going to respond?” Nana looked at her calm expression and said anxiously to her, “The netizens seem to believe them now. They think that you used your connections to snatch Song Lu’s role.

“Public opinion isn’t in your favor.”

Qiao Mianmian had just finished filming.

The drama was going to be broadcasted soon.

As the female lead, if she caused any bad news during this period, it would affect the ratings.

Even if the male lead was Qin Han.

If most people found the female lead annoying, even with Qin Han around, the audience wouldn’t be convinced.

Qiao Mianmian knew the pros and cons, so she had to settle this.

But she couldn’t think of a concrete response.

She was about to send Linda a message when she heard Nana exclaim, “Ah!”

“Mianmian, Shen Fei spoke up for you.”

Nana stared at her cell phone screen in shock.

Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “Shen Fei spoke up for me?”

“That’s right. Shen Fei just posted on Weibo. She spoke up for you.” Nana followed Shen Fei on Weibo, so she saw her post immediately.

“Look, Shen Fei is speaking up for you. Mianmian, are you on good terms with her? Shen Fei rarely interferes with others’ matters.”

Qiao Mianmian looked down at the cell phone screen and saw Shen Fei’s Weibo post.

Shen Fei V: [I saw some comments. I didn’t want to be a busybody, but the rumors are getting out of hand. As someone who knows the situation, I really can’t hold it in anymore. Without any backing and any fighting for the role, Qiao Mianmian got the second female role all on her own. I auditioned with her. I know best how she performed.]
