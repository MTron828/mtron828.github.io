Chapter 1661: Why Was She Drunk Like This

But Mo Yesi was different.

This man was different from any other man she’d ever dreamed of.

She really liked him.

She really envied Qiao Mianmian.

If she could be with Mo Yesi for just one day, she would feel so blissful.

Why was Qiao Mianmian able to get everything she wanted so easily?

She was really indignant.

Qiao Mianmian, just you wait. You won’t always be so lucky.

One day, I’ll step on your head and take off your halo.

And the man beside you will be mine sooner or later!

Qiao Mianmian, who was celebrating the wrap-up of the filming with the crew, was half drunk and collapsed on the sofa.

A few minutes later, the door opened.

A tall figure walked in.

The man entered the private room and looked around. When he saw Qiao Mianmian sleeping in the corner, he frowned and quickly walked over.

“Mianmian?”

Mo Yesi walked to the corner and called out to Qiao Mianmian.

The sleeping girl did not respond.

Mo Yesi smelled the alcohol on her and frowned harder.

He turned around and looked at Bai Yusheng coldly.

“You’re still here, why is she so drunk?”

“I didn’t expect her alcohol tolerance to be so bad.” Bai Yusheng pursed his lips and felt a little regretful. “She said she had no problem drinking two glasses. I thought that since today is a special day, it was fine to let her drink a little. I didn’t expect her to get drunk after just one glass.

“If I’d known that her alcohol tolerance was so low, I wouldn’t have let her drink.”

Mo Yesi rushed over after receiving Bai Yusheng’s call.

After hearing his explanation, Mo Yesi turned around and picked Qiao Mianmian up.

The girl’s body was soft and light as a feather.

“I’ll settle this with you in the future.”

With that, Mo Yesi left with Qiao Mianmian.

There weren’t many people in the private room.

Just Bai Yusheng, Qin Han, and a few important crew members.

Bai Yusheng rubbed his nose and sighed.

His brother-in-law was too protective of his wife.

Qin Han looked at him for a while and smiled. “Director Bai and Mr. Mo seem to be very good friends?”

“I guess so.” Bai Yusheng had a good relationship with Qin Han, so he was willing to tell him some things. “I’ve known him for six to seven years.”

Qin Han was a little surprised. “So, Director Bai and Mr. Mo already know each other. You introduced Mianmian to him?”

“No, they already knew each other before I met her.”

“I heard that Mr. Mo is a relative of the Mo Family?” Qin Han asked curiously. “Is that true?”

“Relative?”

Bai Yusheng smiled.

“Isn’t it?” Qin Han looked at him.

“Of course not.” Bai Yusheng thought for a while and smiled. “If we have to talk about it, he’s a direct relative.”

“Direct?” Qin Han was shocked.

A direct relative of the Mo Family...

Everyone knew that the Second Master of the Mo Family had no descendants.

Thus, the direct relative could only be the Mo Family’s Old Master.

The Mo Family’s Old Master had two sons.
