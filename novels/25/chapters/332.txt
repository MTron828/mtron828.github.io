Chapter 333: You Don’t Have to Explain Anything, I Trust You

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

She’d always insisted on spending more time on building her career first. But if someone like Prince Charming were to appear in her life, love her and pamper her like she was a precious gem, wouldn’t she want to experience that too?

She suddenly felt that she could understand why Qiao Mianmian got married so soon.

Who wouldn’t want to make their man their official husband as soon as possible, if they managed to get someone as outstanding as Prince Charming?!

At least, she knew she would’ve done the same.

Everything was secondary in the face of such perfect looks!

After lunch, Jiang Luoli parted ways with them.

Qiao Chen was still silent, and he returned to his room the moment they went back to Lu Shan Gardens.

Qiao Mianmian sighed as she watched him turn the corner to his room and said out of concern, “Chen Chen is in such low spirits now, should I have a talk with him?”

If it was as she guessed, that Qiao Chen did like Shen Xin...

Then, he would definitely be very upset about what had happened.

Qiao Mianmian was also worried about Qiao Chen’s condition since he had only been discharged a while ago.

Mo Yesi walked towards her and placed an arm around her shoulders. “Qiao Chen is only two years younger than you, he’s not a child anymore. I think he can process his emotions on his own. What he needs most at this point is some alone time. It’ll be worse if you go to him now.”

Qiao Mianmian thought the same, which was why she was hesitating.

She kept silent for a while and then sighed once again. “Chen Chen has never mentioned this to me before. Is that Shen Xin... Shen Rou’s biological sister?”

“Mm.” Mo Yesi nodded.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

What a messy relationship this was.

Shen Rou liked her husband, and Shen Xin liked her brother.

The sisters liked the two men around her.

“I was so angry just now only because Shen Rou started insulting Chen Chen first.” Qiao Mianmian felt a need to explain what went on at the restaurant.

“You don’t have to explain anything, I trust you.” Mo Yesi interrupted her before she could even finish her piece. He looked at her deeply. “You’re not an unreasonable person. If Shen Rou hadn’t gone overboard, you wouldn’t have made such a request.”

Qiao Mianmian was a little taken aback.

Did he trust her... that much? RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

He didn’t even suspect that she might’ve been unreasonable? Not at all?

She asked, “What if I was being unreasonable? Maybe I was making things difficult for her because I didn’t like her?”

“Mm?” The man smiled and raised a brow. “If you didn’t like her because you’re jealous, then I’d be very happy.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Alright, then.

She had to admit that she was extremely happy with the way he unconditionally stood up for her.

“I’m sorry,” Qiao Mianmian said after a few more moments of deliberation. “It was because of me again that you fell out with your friends.”

She didn’t exactly know what she’d done wrong.

But she knew that she was the reason he and his friends ended up in such a state.

This conflict turned out way more serious than the last.

If it wasn’t to protect her, he wouldn’t have gone so far as to hit his buddy.
