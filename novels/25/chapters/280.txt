Chapter 283: I’m the One Who Should Be Apologizing

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

He regretted it.

He regretted being so harsh and hurtful with his words.

He shouldn’t have been so uptight and impulsive.

They’d only known each other for a while.

It wasn’t her fault even if she really did still have some feelings for Su Ze.

After all, they’d been together for so many years.

And were about to get married already.

What he should’ve done was to treat her even better so he could take the place of Su Ze in her heart eventually, not to agitate her like this.

But what he’d done was only going to make her regret marrying him.

If she really got utterly disappointed in him and wanted a divorce...

Mo Yesi got up and walked out of the study.

He’d just left when his cell phone rang.

He looked at it and immediately stopped in his tracks when he saw Qiao Mianmian’s name on the screen.

...

Qiao Mianmian spoke with Jiang Luoli for a while and realized her mistake.

After some self-reflection, she decided to text Mo Yesi to apologize to him.

She’d taken a long time to craft that message before finally sending it to him.

After tapping the “Send” button, she waited anxiously with her clammy fingers wrapped around the cell phone.

Mo Yesi was surely still angry.

Would he forgive her even with that text?

He didn’t seem like a petty person though... maybe he would be alright.

Then again, this was the first time she saw him flare up so badly. How could he cool down so quickly?

Qiao Mianmian had no idea what to expect.

She took a look at her cell phone every few seconds.

Checking if Mo Yesi replied to her yet.

But he hadn’t...

She waited for a whole minute and he still hadn’t replied.

She was getting increasingly anxious and devastated.

Had he seen the message yet?

He mentioned that he was going to do some work. Perhaps he was still busy at work and didn’t notice the message.

Should she send another one, then?

But what if he just didn’t want to reply to her as yet because he was still upset...

Then was there still a point in sending another message?

Qiao Mianmian felt like she was going insane in those few minutes of waiting.

In one moment, she’d guess that he was too busy to see it, and in the next moment, she’d believe that he’d actually already seen it.

She was so conflicted, she decided to just give him a call.

There was no way she could live with this frustration and confusion.

She would really go nuts.

Just as Qiao Mianmian was about to call him, the door was opened.

She looked up and saw a figure enter.

Her eyes widened. “Mo...”

Mo Yesi had his cell phone in his hand as he strode towards her.

Before Qiao Mianmian could ask “Have you seen my text?”, her face made contact with his sturdy chest.

His scent calmed her.

He wrapped his arms around her tightly and, with that hoarse but gentle voice, said, “Baby, it’s not your fault. You didn’t do anything wrong, I’m the one who should be apologizing.

“It’s my fault for saying all the spiteful things in a fit of anger. I shouldn’t have hurt you this way.”
