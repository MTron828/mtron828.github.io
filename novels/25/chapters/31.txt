Chapter 32: Qiao Mianmian, What Do You Mean?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian went quiet.

Her face was slightly hot. “Cough, it has nothing to do with President Chen. He handled it very well. I’m not dissatisfied.”

“Then why are you still unhappy?”

“... Maybe I’m hungry.” Qiao Mianmian had no choice but to think of a reason.

Then she heard the man on the other end of the phone chuckle lowly. “Oh. I’m sorry, there are a lot of things today and I’ve been working for a while. In the future, I will try to come home from work as soon as possible to accompany you.”

Qiao Mianmian: “Cough, cough...”

She... didn’t mean that!

“I’m here.” Mo Yesi paused and said, “Do you want me to find you, or...”

“I’ll go to you,” Qiao Mianmian said before he finished. “I’ll go down immediately.”

Mo Yesi had good looks.

She was worried that he would get all kinds of attention if he came up.

She still thought it was better to be lowkey.

She went to the underground parking lot.

A black Bentley shone its headlights.

As soon as Qiao Mianmian walked by, the door opened.

Inside the car.

The man was holding a thin laptop in his hand, sitting a little lazily. His cold and deep eyes swept across the computer screen, then he raised his head and looked directly at Qiao Mianmian.

They stared at each other.

His eyes were deep as a pond, and her shadow was reflected in his dark eyes.

The underground parking lot was a bit dim.

There were lights in the car.

He sat in the warm light, and his handsome face was shrouded with the soft light, making the lines on his face seem extremely soft and gentle.

Even the light in his eyes seemed to soften.

Qiao Mianmian’s heart suddenly skipped a beat.

Mo Yesi stared at her for a few seconds and then turned away. “Why are you still standing there? Come in.”

“... Oh.”

Qiao Mianmian took a deep breath, touched her slightly hot cheek, and stooped into the car.

The door was closed.

Space seemed to narrow down at once.

There was a faint aroma in the compartment, which was not as pungent as an ordinary car’s perfume. It was a very nice and elegant aroma.

Qiao Mianmian’s heart was beating fast.

She felt his eyes on her the moment she got into the car.

The man beside her was looking at her without shyness.

Qiao Mianmian was uncomfortable.

Just when she wanted to speak, the man’s deep, seductive voice rang in her ears. “Why didn’t you buy anything? Did you get the card from Uncle Li?”

“I did.”

At the mention of the card, Qiao Mianmian remembered that she wanted to return the card and the watch to him.

“So why didn’t you buy anything? Didn’t you see something you liked?” Mo Yesi frowned.

As if he was dissatisfied that she didn’t spend a penny of his.

Qiao Mianmian went quiet.

She found the black card from her bag, his two million-odd watch, and handed it to him. “Mo Yesi, I’m giving it back to you. These things are too valuable, Chen Chen and I can’t accept it.”

Mo Yesi’s frown deepened even further.

The expression on his face was not very good. “Qiao Mianmian, what do you mean?”

As soon as his face sank, Qiao Mianmian was a little scared.

She was not a timid person by nature. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

However, his masculine energy was really too powerful.

Qiao Mianmian really feared him.

Under the gaze of the man’s extremely oppressive and deterrent eyes, Qiao Mianmian swallowed nervously. “Mo Yesi, although we are already husband and wife, I don’t think I’m very comfortable with this relationship. I hope you can give me some time.”
