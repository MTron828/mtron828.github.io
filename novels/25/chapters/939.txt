Chapter 940: Tell Me If You Want the Female Lead

No wonder Michael was so happy.

He knew very well what Mo Yesi’s conditions meant.

Mo Yesi had solved his biggest worry in an instant, so how could he still be angry at him?

At the thought of this, Qiao Mianmian smiled and joked. “Wow, the male lead of four top-notch resources. So it’s that easy to get the male lead role? Then, can you get the female lead role too and get me in through the back door?”

“You want the female lead role?”

Qiao Mianmian was just joking, but Mo Yesi looked down at her and said seriously, “Whose show do you want to act in? I’ll get someone to arrange it immediately. You’re my wife. If you want the female lead role, just let me know. You don’t have to go through the back door.”

Qiao Mianmian said, “Uh, I’m just saying. I don’t have the time now. I still have Brother Bai’s scenes.”

Qiao Mianmian knew that Mo Yesi could do it.

Getting the female lead role was a piece of cake for him.

She just needed to tell him that she was willing to take on anyone’s role.

But even if she had such powerful backing, she still hoped that she could get all the roles herself.

It wasn’t because of him.

Although this seemed a little unreasonable, she hoped to prove herself in this way.

She didn’t want to rely on him for everything.

Especially in her career.

She knew that it would be easier and faster for her to become popular with him around.

But if she could get any role she wanted without any effort, she wouldn’t feel any sense of achievement.

It would also diminish her passion for acting.

“Mo Yesi, can you promise me something?”

Qiao Mianmian stopped and looked at him seriously.

Mo Yesi found it funny and smiled. “What is it?”

Qiao Mianmian’s tone was especially serious. “You’re not allowed to help me get some roles without my knowledge. I want to fight for whatever role I want, even if I don’t get it in the end.

“Just don’t help me. I want to try and see how far I can go on my own.”

Mo Yesi understood her personality and nodded. “Alright, I promise you.”

If his little darling wanted to prove herself, he had to support her.

But he couldn’t leave her alone.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The entertainment industry was a cruel place.

If he really didn’t care about anything, she would definitely be at a disadvantage if she went alone.

With her looks, if no one was around to protect her, it was almost impossible for her to become popular purely by acting.

As a man, Mo Yesi knew what men thought.

It was impossible for any man to not have any feelings for her.

He was willing to let her continue filming and be involved in the entertainment industry because he had the confidence to protect her.

But without his protection, he couldn’t guarantee many things.

“But you have to promise me something too.” Mo Yesi frowned at the thought of this.

Qiao Mianmian agreed readily. “Mm, what is it?”

Mo Yesi narrowed his eyes and saw the elevator doors open. He held her hand and walked in.

After pressing the button, he looked down at her with a serious expression. “No matter what happens in the future, you have to tell me immediately. I don’t want to hear about you from others anymore.”
