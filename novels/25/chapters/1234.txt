Chapter 1236: You’ll Come Over Tonight, Right?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

She politely declined. [I’m sorry, Aunt Bai. I already have an appointment at noon. How about another day?]

One Finger Orchid: [You already have an appointment at noon? I even asked what you like to eat and prepared it for you. It seems like I won’t have the chance today.]

It wasn’t hard to tell that she was a little disappointed.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t bear to see her like this. She immediately sent another message to her and explained: [Yesi and I are going to see my brother at noon, so we should be fine at night. If I have time at night and Aunt Bai doesn’t mind me disturbing you, can I visit you then?]

This time, Madam Bai replied quickly: [Of course. I’ll welcome you whenever you come. If you’re coming, let me know in advance. I’ll personally cook for you two tonight!]

Madam Bai, who was still disappointed a second ago, was elated again.

She sent a few messages.

She asked Qiao Mianmian what they liked.

Qiao Mianmian chatted with her for more than an hour.

When it was about time, she took the car to Mo Yesi’s office and waited for him to get off work to look for Qiao Chen.

...

Mo Yesi was still busy when she arrived.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t disturb him. She got the secretary to make her a cup of coffee and sat on the sofa playing with her cell phone while waiting for him to finish.

Qiao Mianmian was scrolling through her Moments.

She saw the update notification on her WeChat friend circle and clicked on it.

She didn’t add many people on WeChat. They were all people she knew from work. Most of the updates on her Moments were related to her circle.

Hence, Madam Bai’s post was especially unique.

Madam Bai sent a group of photos of her watering the flowers in the garden.

There was also a fat orange cat hanging on a tree branch, looking at Madam Bai with an especially cold expression.

Qiao Mianmian looked at the chubby orange cat and found it instantly adorable.

She liked Madam Bai and commented: [Hahaha, it’s really a big orange cat. This cat is so fat that it has no neck. It’s so cute.]

Madam Bai was probably playing with her cell phone, so she quickly replied: [Mianmian, do you like this cat? It’s a stray cat here. I named it Orange. Orange is especially cute. Come over early tonight, I’ll take you to see it.] Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Qiao Mianmian replied.

After a while, Qiao Mianmian saw that Madam Bai had updated her Moments again.

Perhaps it was because she commented that cats were cute.

This time, Madam Bai updated a set of photos.

They were all photos of the orange cat. The camera was so close to the cat’s face.

After sending the picture, Madam Bai even sent her a private message: [Mianmian, do you think Orange is especially cute? Actually, it’s not very photogenic, this cat is much cuter than in the picture. This cat is used to being wild, sometimes it can’t be seen for days, so I got someone to catch it just now. When you come over, you can see it.]

Madam Bai seemed to be afraid that Qiao Mianmian wouldn’t go over tonight. She immediately sent another message: [Mianmian, you’ll come over tonight, right?]

Qiao Mianmian finally understood.

Madam Bai was probably afraid that she wouldn’t go over at night and knew that she liked cats, so she sent her photos to tempt her.
