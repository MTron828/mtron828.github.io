Chapter 1704: The Type She Hated the Most

Tang Ya was stunned for a moment before smiling again. “Miss Qiao, you’re overthinking it. I don’t mean it that way. Actually, you and Madam Mo are already at odds with each other. There’s no need for me to drive a wedge between you. I said that because I really think Miss Qiao is a good person. I think Madam Mo must have misunderstood you, which is why your relationship isn’t harmonious.

“I hope to find the problem and help you solve it.

“You’re family, after all. It’s not good to be so strained.”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t believe her.

She didn’t believe that an outsider was so concerned about her family matters.

It was the first time she met Tang Ya, so she didn’t know her well.

But Qiao Mianmian trusted her instincts.

She didn’t feel good about Tang Ya.

Although Tang Ya looked gentle and polite, her gaze made Qiao Mianmian uncomfortable.

Coupled with what she said and did now.

Qiao Mianmian was almost sure there was something wrong with her. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

She wondered where Madam Mo got to know her and even brought her home.

“Miss Tang, you don’t have to worry about our family matters.” Qiao Mianmian spoke again. “You’d better mind your own business. I think my mother-in-law really appreciates you, that’s why she brought you to this banquet. No matter what, Miss Tang shouldn’t have done this behind her back.

“I won’t tell my mother-in-law about this, but Miss Tang doesn’t have to worry about our family matters.” Qiao Mianmian stood up and left.

Tang Ya clenched her wine glass.

This Qiao Mianmian wasn’t so easy to fool.

She thought that since her relationship with Madam Mo was already so strained, it would be useful to sow discord.

But she didn’t fall for it.

It seemed like it wasn’t easy to sow discord between her and Mo Yesi.

At this thought, Tang Ya pursed her lips and looked awful.

She took a deep breath and drank the red wine in one gulp. She felt a little better.

So what if it was difficult?

No one could stop her.

Not long after Qiao Mianmian left, Tang Ya was about to leave too.

Just as she was about to get up, she saw a shadow.

She looked up and saw a handsome smiling face. The man’s eyes were slender and long, his nose bridge was straight, and his lips were curled up in a devilish arc. He looked very indecent.

He was like a playboy.

“Hi, Beauty, can we get to know each other?” Yan Shaoqing raised his wine glass and sat down directly beside her. He looked at Tang Ya with his peach blossom eyes and said, “Let me introduce myself first. My name is Yan Shaoqing, and the Chairman of the Yan Corporation is my Big Brother. I’m 24 this year, and I’m 1.84 meters tall. My current relationship status is single. Beauty, I think you’re my type. Shall we get to know each other?”

Tang Ya frowned.

She hated men like Yan Shaoqing.

She immediately turned cold and wanted to leave.
