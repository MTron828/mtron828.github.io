Chapter 752: I’m Willing

“I do.” Qiao Mianmian glanced at the phone again and suddenly felt that Shen Rou was a little pitiful.

Was this the last bit of stubbornness?

She didn’t even hang up?

In any case, if it was her, she wouldn’t be able to take it if she heard the person she liked being so intimate with another woman.

“Hubby, Miss Shen hasn’t hung up yet.” Qiao Mianmian kindly reminded him. “Shouldn’t you ask Miss Shen why she’s looking for you? I think it’s important since she called so late.”

Mo Yesi seemed to have just recalled that he still had to answer the call. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He looked at Qiao Mianmian and raised an eyebrow. He didn’t bother to lower his voice as he asked, “You don’t mind?”

“What’s there for me to mind?” Qiao Mianmian said magnanimously. “You and Miss Shen are just friends. It’s normal to call your friends, right? Pick up.”

“You really don’t mind?”

“Mm, you’re not flirting with any woman behind my back, what’s there to mind.” Qiao Mianmian urged him with her eyes. “Don’t make Miss Shen wait too long, pick it up.”

Seeing that she really didn’t mind, Mo Yesi picked up his cell phone.

“It’s so late, why are you looking for me?” His voice was cold.

On the other end of the line, Shen Rou’s voice trembled as if she was suppressing something. “Ah Si, is Mianmian so strict with you now? Do you have to get her permission to pick up someone’s call? Don’t you hate it when people control you and interfere with your matters? Why are you...”

Before she could finish her sentence, Mo Yesi interrupted her coldly. “You’ve misunderstood. She has never cared about me and never asked me to do this.”

“Then you...”

“I did it willingly. What do you want?”

“I-I heard from Aunt Mo that she was very angry when you blocked her number. Ah Si, I was trying to persuade you...”

“You called just for this?” Mo Yesi interrupted her impatiently.

“Ah Si, I...”

“If this is the only reason, then we have nothing to say. It’s getting late, Mianmian is sleepy, and I have to sleep with her. That’s all.”

Mo Yesi hung up.

After hanging up, he placed his cell phone on the cabinet.

He walked to the table with Qiao Mianmian in his arms. He looked at the untouched dishes on the table and frowned. “Why haven’t you eaten? Is it not to your liking?”

“No, I want to wait for you to eat with me.”

“Didn’t you say you were hungry a long time ago?” Mo Yesi rubbed her head and sat down with her in his arms. He picked up a prawn with his chopsticks and tasted it. When he felt that it was still warm, he picked up another one and fed it to her.

He frowned slightly, but his eyes were full of affection. “Since you’re hungry, eat first. What are you waiting for me for?”

Qiao Mianmian opened her mouth and ate the prawn.

The food he ordered was naturally from the best hotel.

The taste was definitely top-notch.

The food was kept in the lunch box, so it wasn’t cold at all.

The prawn was very tender and delicious, and it instantly whetted her appetite. She had just eaten one when her stomach started growling.

Mo Yesi scooped some more food into her mouth. “You’re already so hungry, why are you still waiting for me? Are you stupid?”

Qiao Mianmian obediently opened her mouth and swallowed the food in a few mouthfuls. She then grabbed her chopsticks and picked up more.
