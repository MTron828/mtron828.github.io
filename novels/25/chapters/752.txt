Chapter 754: There Are a Lot of Strawberries on Her Neck

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“No, Ah Si’s wife can only be me. I’m the one who will be by his side in the end. It’s me, not Qiao Mianmian!”

The next day.

Qiao Mianmian packed up and walked out of the room. She bumped into Nana, who had just walked out of the other room.

Nana blushed and greeted her awkwardly. “Ahem. Sister Mianmian, good morning.”

“Good morning.”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t notice Nana’s expression. She yawned and said lazily, “I’m going down for breakfast. Are you coming with us?”

“No, it’s fine. I’ll just have something to eat later. I won’t disturb you and your boyfriend.” Nana looked at the red marks on Qiao Mianmian’s neck and hesitated. “Erm, Sister Mianmian...”

“Mm?” Qiao Mianmian glanced at her.

“Uh...” Nana glanced at her neck again, then quickly walked to her side and whispered in her ear, “Find something to cover the hickeys on your neck. It’s not good to be seen by others.”

After all, she was an actress.

It was too eye-catching to go out with a hickey.

Moreover, the public didn’t even know that Qiao Mianmian had a boyfriend.

The company wanted her to keep it a secret for now.

These hickeys... couldn’t be seen.

“What?” Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

Nana pointed at her neck. “Sister Mianmian, you have a lot of strawberries on your neck. These... should all be strawberries.”

Although she was still single, she didn’t have much experience in such matters.

But even if she hadn’t eaten pork, she’d seen pigs run.

And last night... she even heard some strange sounds.

So, the hickeys were all there.

“Strawberry?” Qiao Mianmian was stunned for a few seconds before taking out her cell phone to take a picture.

When she saw the dense hickeys on her neck, her fair face blushed.

She hadn’t noticed it when she was washing up.

She had no idea that she had so many hickeys on her neck.

Mo Yesi was a beast!

She’d been so entranced by him last night that she’d forgotten to tell him about it. But even if she’d forgotten to tell him, he should’ve known better.

He knew that she was filming today, but he still left so many love bites on her neck.

If it was winter, she could use a scarf to cover herself.

But it was summer now.

What was she to do?

Qiao Mianmian got angrier as she looked at the obvious red marks on her neck.

“Baby, I’m done packing. We can leave now.”

In her fit of anger, she saw the culprit walk out of the room slowly.

The man was clad in black from head to toe, exuding a strong aura of asceticism. His long legs were wrapped in black trousers, and he was walking towards her elegantly.

He was buttoning his shirt.

After tying a few beads, he walked to Qiao Mianmian and reached out to her. “Baby, help me tie it.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Qiao Mianmian thought about the hickeys and glared at him.

“Mm?” Mo Yesi raised his brows in confusion. “What’s wrong?”

Qiao Mianmian continued to glare at him.

Mo Yesi was even more confused. “Baby, what happened? Who made you angry?”
