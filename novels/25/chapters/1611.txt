Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Under her expectant gaze, Gong Zeli took another bite.

With just a taste, he felt that this dish wasn’t on the same level as the previous one.

“How is it? Is it good?” Madam Gong asked again.

Beside him, Shangguan Qing looked at him expectantly.

Gong Zeli immediately understood what was going on.

He put down his chopsticks and picked up the napkin on the table, wiping his lips slowly.

“Mom.”

After a while, Gong Zeli stopped her when Madam Gong was about to get him more food.

He narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “You don’t have to spend so much effort on this. I came back today to tell you in person not to try to matchmake me and Shangguan Qing.

“I’m not interested in women like her.”

Looking at Shangguan Qing’s pale face, Gong Zeli didn’t care about her feelings as he continued coldly, “What? The daughter of the Shangguan Family can’t be married off, so you’re trying to promote her to our Gong Family?”

“Zeli, what are you saying?” Madam Gong’s expression changed immediately. She frowned and said, “How could you say something so overboard? Hurry up and apologize to Qingqing.”

“Apologize?”

Gong Zeli looked at Shangguan Qing expressionlessly and said with disgust in his eyes, “I’m speaking the truth, why should I apologize? Shangguan Qing, I thought I’d made things clear enough to you. Do you think this harassment is useful?

“My marriage can’t be decided by anyone but myself. Do you think it’s useful to please my mom and marry into the family?”

Madam Gong’s expression was awful. “Enough, Zeli. Don’t say anymore.

“Qingqing is a guest. I invited her to our house. How could you say such things to her?”

“Guest?” Gong Zeli sneered. “That’s your guest, not mine. If she’s around in the future, you don’t have to call me back.

“Also.”

Gong Zeli narrowed his eyes and looked at the pale Shangguan Qing coldly. “Shangguan Qing, I’m warning you. If you dare to look for Qiao Mianmian again, don’t blame me for being nasty.”

Shangguan Qing had been enduring it.

But she couldn’t take it anymore.

She looked up with reddened eyes and said angrily, “So the rumors online are true. Do you really like that woman?

“She’s just a small actress who has flirted with so many men. What’s so good about her? Brother Zeli, even if you still like Shen Rou, she’s better than that kind of woman. You...”

Bam!

The sound of glass hitting the ground was followed by a piercing scream. “Ah!”

There was a shattered wine glass beside Shangguan Qing’s feet. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

And the red wine spilled all over her.

The cup flew past her and almost hit her face.

Shangguan Qing widened her eyes in shock.

The man’s eyes and his aura were extremely cold.

His gaze was as sharp as a knife.

Shangguan Qing only exchanged a glance with him before looking away fearfully.

Thinking about the wine glass that almost hit her face, she trembled in fear and hugged Madam Gong’s arm tightly. “Auntie, I’m so scared. I want to go home.”
