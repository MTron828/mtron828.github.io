Lin Huizhen went silent. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

She held the bowl of steaming soup and stood there helplessly for a while before saying, “Anxin, I know you don’t like what I’m saying, but I have to be honest. In the past, with Su Ze supporting you in his company, you could do whatever you wanted. But it’s really different now…

“That slut Qiao Mianmian is doing well now. She won’t let you have an easy time. We used to have a lot of grievances with that slut. You’re in the entertainment industry with her, so she has to suppress you.

“It’s hard for anything good to come to you.

“Mom’s doing this for your own good. That’s why I’m advising you to take the job first. No matter what, it’s better than staying idle at home.. You said that the industry is very competitive. If you do nothing for a while, you might be replaced by a newbie.”

Qiao Anxin was furious.

Like a cat whose tail had been stepped on, she exploded. “Don’t talk to me about that scumbag Su Ze. He and Qiao Mianmian aren’t good people. Mom, do you think I lost to that slut Qiao Mianmian?”

Before Lin Huizhen could say anything, Qiao Anxin gritted her teeth. “I won’t lose to her, I definitely won’t lose to her! No matter what, I won’t lose to that slut.”

“But Anxin…”

Lin Huizhen looked at her daughter’s ferocious expression and hesitated for a while before saying, “I think you should give in. I don’t like that slut too, but she’s really not someone we can deal with.

“She’s the daughter of the Bai family now. One word from her and we’ll be in trouble. If your dad wasn’t around, that slut would have already attacked us.

“It’s your dad’s birthday in a few days. I plan to get him to call Qiao Mianmian back for a meal. When the time comes, you can apologize to her at the dining table. Your dad can help you say a few more words. I’m sure she won’t make things difficult for you in the future.”

“What?!”

Qiao Anxin looked at her mother in disbelief. “Mom, you want me to apologize to Qiao Mianmian? Are you still my biological mother?”

“I’m saying this because I’m your biological mother. Anxin, be realistic.” Lin Huizhen sighed. “The Qiao family is getting worse by the day. Your dad’s health is deteriorating, too. Our family can only rely on you now.

“If you get banned again, what will happen to our family?

“If you can soften up and reconcile with Qiao Mianmian and let her help you, your future will be much easier.”

“Impossible.” Qiao Anxin was so angry that her face turned pale. “Mom, I won’t give in to that slut.”

“Anxin…” Lin Huizhen tried to persuade her.

Qiao Anxin waved her hand in frustration. “Stop talking!”

She slapped the bowl to the ground, causing the hot soup to splash onto Lin Huizhen’s pants.

Qiao Anxin’s expression changed. She looked at the porcelain bowl on the ground and then up at her mother’s stiff expression. After a few seconds of silence, she said, “I have something on, I’ll go out first.” Then, she walked past her pale-faced mother and left the bedroom.

Father Qiao heard the commotion and saw the mess on the ground. He frowned and asked, “What happened?”

“It’s alright, I accidentally dropped the bowl.” Lin Huizhen quickly hid her expression and called a housemaid to clean the room.
