Chapter 2214: Baby, Our Family Doesn’t Lack Money

“Mo Yesi, are you crazy?” Qiao Mianmian’s heart was bleeding.

Mo Yesi spent 70 million yuan on a jewelry set for her.

All the women in the venue looked at her with envy.

But Qiao Mianmian didn’t feel pleased.

She was a little pained.

She felt that Mo Yesi must be crazy.

He was a prodigal.

70 million yuan.

Even though Qiao Mianmian was rich now, she still felt that it was a huge sum.

She felt that it was worth it to spend 70 million yuan on a villa.

But spending 70 million on a jewelry set definitely wasn’t. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Even if she liked it, she couldn’t bear to spend so much money on it.

Mo Yesi looked down at her. “Baby, what’s wrong?”

“Why did you spend so much money on it? It’s too expensive. You shouldn’t have spent so much money on it.” Qiao Mianmian felt the pinch.

After all, she was already married to Mo Yesi.

His money was her money.

“Whatever you like, it’s worth it no matter how expensive it is.” Mo Yesi looked at her pained expression and smiled. He then reached out and rubbed her head. “Baby, our family doesn’t lack money. Buy whatever you like, there’s no need to consider money.

“Your husband’s biggest motivation to earn money is to spend it on you. If you can’t bear to spend it, then what’s the point of me earning money? Not to mention 70 million, even 700 million yuan is worth it as long as it can make you happy.”

Yan Shaoqing was stunned by his words. He looked at Mo Yesi as if it was his first time meeting him.

He really didn’t know Mo Yesi well enough.

Was the Mo Yesi he knew so good at sweet-talking?

He was even better than him at coaxing women.

Yan Shaoqing thought that it was a good thing that Mo Yesi was different from them. Before Qiao Mianmian appeared, he had never been with a woman.

Otherwise, wouldn’t all the beauties be taken away by him?

…

Shen Rou left early.

She left after Mo Yesi took the jewelry set.

She felt that she had lost all face and became a joke in everyone’s eyes.

Thus, she didn’t have the face to stay at the banquet anymore.

She didn’t want to see Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi being so loving.

She was afraid that she would lose control of her temper and do something irrational.

An hour later.

At the Shen Residence.

Shen Rou heard laughter after she got out of the car and entered the living room.

She looked up and saw Shen Xin sitting beside Mother Shen. Mother Shen was holding her hand and seemed to be saying something to her.

A housemaid greeted Shen Rou respectfully. “First Miss.”

“Rourou, you’re back.” Mother Shen waved at her and smiled. “What a coincidence. Your sister arrived 10 minutes earlier than you. She asked me where you were, and now you are back.

“Didn’t you go to the banquet? Why are you back so soon?”

Shen Rou didn’t answer her. Instead, she looked down at Shen Xin.

Shen Rou didn’t seem happy to see her sister’s return.

Especially when she saw Shen Xin’s innocent and sweet face, her expression became even colder.
