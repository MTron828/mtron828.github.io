Qiao Mianmian winced in pain and scrunched up her little face.

Mo Yesi immediately stopped. “Does it hurt?” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Qiao Mianmian opened her mouth, but before she could say anything, Lu Rao clicked his tongue and said, “Little girl, I’m telling you that this is the first time Ah Si is serving someone. If I didn’t see it with my own eyes, I wouldn’t have even believed it.

“Even Young Lady Shen, who grew up with him, has never received such treatment before.”

As soon as Lu Rao spoke, he felt a chill behind his back, as if a cold wind was rushing into his body.

He felt goosebumps all over his body.

He looked up and saw Mo Yesi narrow his eyes coldly, staring at him with a warning in his eyes.

Lu Rao froze for a few seconds before realizing that he had said something wrong.

He hurriedly explained, “Little girl, don’t get me wrong. Ah Si and Young Lady Shen are purely friends, their relationship cannot be purer. They have known each other for so many years, so if there was something between them, they would have been together already.”

Qiao Mianmian looked at Lu Rao, dumbfounded.

She didn’t say anything, did she?

“Really, he and Young Lady Shen are like brothers and sisters. You don’t have to worry about it,” Lu Rao added as if he was afraid of her misunderstanding.

This added sentence made Qiao Mianmian even more dumbfounded.

However, Mo Yesi’s face grew darker and darker, and his eyes turned colder and colder.

Lu Rao suddenly realized that his expression was getting darker.

It was fine if he didn’t explain it, but now that he did, it seemed like Mo Yesi had something to do with Young Lady Shen.

Now that Mo Yesi’s expression was getting uglier, Lu Rao thought that his life was more important and quickly walked towards the door. “Well, there’s nothing left for me to do here. I’ll take my leave first, let’s have a meal together next time, hahaha.”

Then, as if his previous fatigue was swept away and his feet were greased, he rushed out in the blink of an eye.

After Lu Rao left.

Only the two of them were left in the big dean’s office.

He continued applying ointment on her wounds, his actions much gentler than before.

When he wiped the wound on her leg, he squatted at her feet and gently lifted her calf.

His warm breath exhaled on her lap from time to time.

It felt wet and itchy.

Qiao Mianmian looked down at how he was seriously applying the ointment on her and felt her heartbeat accelerate.

It was probably because he was a doctor before that he seemed familiar with these things.

After dealing with the bruises on her body, Mo Yesi pressed her shoulder and carefully checked it to make sure that he didn’t miss anything out before letting go of her.

“Although it’s only a slight bruise, you still have to be careful.” He reached out to tuck a strand of her hair behind her ear. “Remember to apply ointment on time.”

“Okay, I know.” Qiao Mianmian nodded obediently. Then, she thought of her school and said, “Can I go back to school now?”

Mo Yesi nodded.

He glanced at the time on his watch. It was time to return to his company too.

There were still many things he had to deal with.

This trip could be regarded as a break from work.

“Then, let’s go.”

Qiao Mianmian had always been a good student and never skipped classes nor left early.

She had acting class in the afternoon with her favorite tutor, so she didn’t want to miss it.
