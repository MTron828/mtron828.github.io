Chapter 1839: Are You Going to Sue The Media That Made the News Today?

Linda replied quickly: [Are you going to sue the press that made the news today?]

Qiao Mianmian: [Mm, can I?]

Linda: [Your boyfriend is Mo Yesi, you can do whatever you want. How about this, I’ll contact the company’s public relations department immediately.]

Qiao Mianmian: [Sister Xie, thank you.]

Linda: [Focus on the show. Don’t be affected by all this nonsense.]

Qiao Mianmian: [Mm. Sister Xie, I have a favor to ask of you. Help me check on a few IDs. I suspect that someone paid them to go against me.]

Linda: [Okay. I’d check even if you didn’t tell me. I saw the accounts you mentioned.]

Qiao Mianmian was referring to those black accounts.

From the start till now, they had been constantly criticizing her.

Every time there was negative news about her, those few anti-fans would always jump around in the comments section.

This time, Qiao Mianmian couldn’t take it anymore.

She was determined to find out who the mastermind was.

Qiao Mianmian saw that it was getting late and got up to wash up.

When she was done washing up, she was on the way to the kitchen when she bumped into Zhan Bo, who woke up as early as she did.

Thinking of his Weibo post, Qiao Mianmian smiled and thanked him. “Zhan Bo, thank you for speaking up for me. I saw your post. Oh right, I’ve followed you, so please follow me as well.

“In case the fans think we’re not getting along.”

“You are following me?”

“Yeah.”

Zhan Bo immediately took out his phone and clicked on Qiao Mianmian’s Weibo.

“Don’t take those words to heart.” Although he wasn’t the one who had criticized Qiao Mianmian, he still felt a little apologetic. “The reporters are just trying to get more views. That’s why they’re spouting nonsense without verification.

“Some of my fans might have been too aggressive and said something bad. I apologize on their behalf. I’ve already told them not to attack you anymore.”

“You don’t have to apologize to me.” Qiao Mianmian wasn’t someone who couldn’t tell right from wrong. “The fans’ actions can only represent themselves, it has nothing to do with you.”

“But that incident started because of me.” Zhan Bo’s eyes were still apologetic. “No matter what, I have to apologize to you. I don’t wish for those things to affect our relationship.”

Qiao Mianmian cooked so well.

If she got angry and stopped cooking for him, what would he do in the future?

“Of course not.” Qiao Mianmian patted his shoulder. “Don’t worry, I won’t blame you for your fans’ actions.”

“Does that mean I can still eat your food this morning?” Zhan Bo immediately asked what he was most concerned about.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“Since you’re already up, help me out.” Qiao Mianmian glared at him and laughed. “Don’t think you’ll get to eat without doing anything.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Okay okay okay.” Zhan Bo agreed immediately. “Tell me what I need to do. I’ll be your assistant.”

“Let’s go to the kitchen first.” Qiao Mianmian thought about what she should do in the morning.

...

By the time the others got up, breakfast was ready.

Qiao Mianmian cooked just like yesterday.

This morning, she even branded a scallion pancake. The group that had been clamoring about dieting and losing weight all ate happily.
