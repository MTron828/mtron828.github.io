Chapter 2876: Qiao Mianmian Responded to the Scandals

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Mom, what are you doing?” Qiao Anxin pushed Lin Huizhen away angrily and glared at her. “Where else can I go now? This Yuncheng City is the Bai and Mo families’ territory, where can I hide?

“She’ll find me wherever I hide.”

“Then-then what should we do?” Lin Huizhen’s face was pale. “Are we just going to wait for the police to come and arrest us?”

“Why should the police arrest me?” Qiao Anxin gritted her teeth. “She said that I was spreading rumors and slandering her, but I didn’t say that she had an affair with Gong Zeli. Even if the police come, they can’t convict me with that video.

“I’m not afraid of her. She’s just scaring me!”

“But didn’t you say that she has the Bai and Mo families backing her up? What if she insists on framing you?”

“Then, I’ll expose what she did and let people know how she used her power to bully others. I don’t believe that she doesn’t care about what others say about her. Look at her.”

Although Qiao Anxin said that, she was still unsure.

She couldn’t fight Qiao Mianmian with anything else.

Hence, she could only use public opinion as her weapon.

But what if Qiao Mianmian didn’t care about public opinion or what others thought of her?

Then, Qiao Anxin really had no choice.

“Really?” Lin Huizhen was skeptical. “She’s afraid of this?”

“Of course. If she wasn’t, she wouldn’t have gotten someone to remove her trending searches so quickly. This shows that she still cares what others think of her. Anyway, I won’t leave Yuncheng City again. This time, no one can force me to leave.”

Qiao Anxin and Lin Huizhen waited for a long time, but the police didn’t come.

Both mother and daughter heaved a sigh of relief when they realized that Qiao Mianmian hadn’t called the police.

…

Qiao Mianmian organized the recording and sent it along with the statement written by the Public Relations Department.

The caption contained only one word: Truth.

Ten minutes after the post was posted, it was trending.

# Qiao Mianmian responded to the scandal #

# Shocking! Qiao Mianmian’s statement revealed shocking news #

The netizens reacted strongly.

“Damn, is what Qiao Mianmian said true? Jiang Xinyue is actually Qiao Anxin? That’s ridiculous.”

“F*ck, f*ck, f*ck, today’s news is too explosive. The recording is already out, and there are so many stone hammers in the statement. This can’t be fake, right? This can explain why Jiang Xinyue has such bad intentions towards Qiao Mianmian, and why she would whitewash Qiao Anxin and Su Ze in the video. So, she’s Qiao Anxin herself. Bah, she’s really shameless.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“If Jiang Xinyue and Qiao Anxin are the same person, shouldn’t Qiao Anxin hate Qiao Mianmian? Why did she have to do plastic surgery to look like her?”

“Of course, it’s because she’s jealous of Qiao Mianmian’s beauty. To put it bluntly, Qiao Anxin’s looks are alright, but she’s far inferior to Qiao Mianmian. Perhaps she was jealous of Qiao Mianmian’s looks since she was young. Now that Qiao Mianmian’s married to such an impressive husband, she wants to hook up with a rich man like her.”

“Having just eaten the melon, it means that real life is indeed more dramatic than novels. I can tell that Jiang Xinyue had plastic surgery, but she was actually Qiao Anxin in the past. I really couldn’t tell. Her contract was terminated by the Gong Corporation, and now her true identity has been exposed by Qiao Mianmian.. She can forget about being in the entertainment industry in the future.”
