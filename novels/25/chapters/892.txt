Chapter 893: Are You Coming Over Tomorrow?

She didn’t mind adding him as a friend.

Someone as busy as Tu Yilei definitely didn’t have much time to play.

They probably wouldn’t be able to play the game together.

After adding him as a friend, they chatted about the game for about an hour.

As they chatted, Qiao Mianmian realized that she had a lot of hobbies, just like Tu Yilei.

For example, both of them were very homely in private.

Like her, Tu Yilei hated socializing too.

They all liked little animals and even picked up stray cats and dogs when they were young.

And they even gave the stray dogs they picked up the same name, Bebe.

Soon, two hours passed.

When Tu Yilei’s drip was almost done, Michael returned.

“Miss Qiao, thank you for guarding Little Tu for so long. I’m back now. Miss Qiao, you can leave first if you have something on. I’ll take care of Little Tu.” Michael pushed open the door and entered the ward. When he heard the laughter coming from the room, he couldn’t help but frown.

He glanced at Tu Yilei worriedly.

This brat had grown up and had a woman he liked. He wanted to date.

He could understand all of this.

In fact, he felt that if Tu Yilei really liked this girl and insisted on being with her, he could even secretly date her if he wanted to.

But this girl had a boyfriend.

And that man wasn’t someone to be trifled with.

The reason Huang Yilin was so unlucky to be exposed was most likely related to that man. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Even if they didn’t know who that man was, he could easily deal with Huang Yilin. This person wasn’t someone they could offend.

If that person knew that this little brat was thinking about his woman, he was afraid...

At this thought, Michael’s expression changed. He quickly walked towards the bed and stood between Tu Yilei and Qiao Mianmian.

He looked down at Qiao Mianmian and said, “Miss Qiao, you’ve worked hard. Go back and rest now.”

“Michael, you...” Behind him, Tu Yilei frowned.

Michael turned to look at him and smiled. “Little Tu Tu, Miss Qiao has been watching over you for a few hours. It’s time to eat. You can’t possibly let her continue watching over you while she’s hungry, right? Moreover, Miss Qiao has her own matters to attend to. We can’t delay her, right?”

Tu Yilei pursed his lips and kept quiet.

Michael smiled and said, “You can bear to let such a beauty go hungry, but I can’t bear to. Alright. Isn’t it enough with me watching over you? I brought you your favorite three fresh dumplings. Try one?”

Tu Yilei kept quiet for a few more seconds before looking up at Qiao Mianmian. “Miss Qiao, you should go and eat. Micheal will be here. You don’t have to come back today. Go back and rest well.”

“Alright, then.”

Qiao Mianmian looked at the time and realized that it was getting late. She got up and said, “I’ll get going, then. Take care of yourself, Senior Tu. I’ll come and see you tomorrow.”

Tu Yilei’s eyes lit up.

He was pleasantly surprised. “Miss Qiao, are you coming over tomorrow?”

Qiao Mianmian nodded. “Of course I will. Senior Tu, you’re in the hospital because of me, how could I not come to see you? But if you don’t want to be disturbed by too many people, I can...”
