Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Baby.”

“Mo Yesi, are you socializing tonight?” Qiao Mianmian didn’t go to the Mo Corporation today. Mo Yesi was going out to socialize with someone, and she didn’t like to socialize with them, so she stayed at home and read the script for the whole day.

“Tonight?”

“Mm. Are you still accompanying them tonight?”

“Baby, wait. Let me ask Wei Zheng.”

A few seconds later, Mo Yesi smiled and said, “I’m free tonight. Why? Do you have any plans for tonight?”

“I’ll treat you to a meal.” Qiao Mianmian smiled at the thought of being nominated. “I wonder if Chairman Mo is willing to give me face.”

“Mrs. Mo, please. Chairman Mo will always give you face.” Mo Yesi smiled. He seemed to be in a much better mood because of her call. “Why are you suddenly treating me to a meal? Did something good happen?”

“Mm, it’s a happy occasion.” Qiao Mianmian thought that he was still socializing and didn’t intend to talk to him for too long. She kept him in suspense and said, “I’ll tell you when we meet tonight. I won’t disturb you anymore. Bye, see you tonight.”

But Mo Yesi didn’t intend to hang up too quickly. He quickly said, “You don’t even let me guess? The happy occasion you mentioned… could it be that you’re pregnant?”

He sounded rather expectant.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Mo Yesi hadn’t taken any precautions since they agreed on trying to get pregnant.

But she shouldn’t be pregnant so soon.

Mo Yesi was already going crazy over the child.

She didn’t know why he wanted children so much. At his age, many men were playful.

They didn’t want to be a father too soon.

“No, it has nothing to do with pregnancy. You’ll know when the time comes. I’m hanging up. Let’s talk tonight.”

…

“Is Chairman Mo picking up Mrs. Mo’s call?”

A middle-aged man in sportswear who had just finished playing golf walked over. Beside him was a young and beautiful woman. The woman took the cue from him and handed him a warm towel obediently.

The middle-aged man wiped the sweat off his face and handed the towel back to the woman.

Mo Yesi locked his cell phone and turned to look at the middle-aged man. “Chairman Zhao, why aren’t you playing anymore?”

“I’m tired, let’s rest for a while.” The middle-aged man called Chairman Zhao smiled and said, “I’m old, my physical fitness can’t compare to young men’s.”

“Chairman Zhao is at his most mature and charming age. It’s too early to say that. Since Chairman Zhao wants to rest for a while, I’ll accompany you.” Mo Yesi turned around and sat down at the rest area. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The middle-aged man walked over.

A staff member immediately came over and poured them some tea.

The young and beautiful woman beside the middle-aged man followed him and massaged his shoulders.

As she did so, she asked, “Chairman Zhao, is this strength alright?”

The middle-aged man narrowed his eyes. “Mm, not bad.”

The young and beautiful woman massaged the middle-aged man’s shoulders, but her eyes were all on Mo Yesi.

She stole a few glances at him.

It turned out that this was the Second Young Master of the Mo family, the Chairman of the Mo Corporation, whom Young Lady Shen had been pining for for over 20 years..
