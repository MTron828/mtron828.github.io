“Aren’t you sleepy?” Mo Shixiu stroked her head. “You really don’t want to sleep for a while?”

“I feel a little sleepy now.” Jiang Luoli blinked and yawned.

“Then, sleep for a while.” Mo Shixiu adjusted the blanket for her. “You need a good sleep. Do you need me to sing a song for you?”

“Alright.” Jiang Luoli yawned again, then said lazily, “I want to hear the goodnight song you often sing to me.”

Mo Shixiu treated her like a child.

At home, he had developed the habit of singing to coax her to sleep.

Hence, whenever Jiang Luoli wanted to sleep, Mo Shixiu would sing for her.

Such a request was too unreasonable for an adult, but Mo Shixiu was willing to pamper her.

One of them was willing to fight, while the other was willing to take the beating. They were originally a couple with very different personalities, but unexpectedly, they got along very well.

Previously, Assistant Xu felt that Jiang Luoli wasn’t suitable for Mo Shixiu at all.

He felt that it was just a moment of novelty. It definitely wouldn’t last.

After all, their personalities, habits, and environments were too different.

Initially, even Qiao Mianmian felt that Jiang Luoli and Mo Shixiu weren’t suitable.

To put it bluntly, they weren’t from the same world.

But who would have thought?

This pair that no one thought highly of made it this far.

Not only did they not separate as others thought, but their relationship was even getting better.

Jiang Luoli slowly closed her eyes as she heard Mo Shixiu humming a familiar tune.

His voice was low and gentle as if he was whispering sweet nothings…

Jiang Luoli’s eyelids became heavy. She fell asleep before Mo Shixiu finished singing.

Mo Shixiu looked at her for a long time after she fell asleep.

It was only when he heard a familiar voice from the corridor and heard footsteps approaching the door that he stood up and looked out.

“Why are you here?” Mo Shixiu walked out of the room and closed the door. He looked at Madam Mo coldly.

“Shixiu, I…”

“Luoli just fell asleep, don’t wake her up. Let’s talk somewhere else.”

Mo Shixiu interrupted Madam Mo coldly and turned to walk towards the rest area.

Madam Mo looked at her son, whose expression was cold and indifferent. She felt terrible and angry. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Now, she was a sinner in everyone’s eyes.

Not to mention her son, even her husband, who had always treated her well, was a little cold to her recently.

Everyone felt that she had done something wrong.

Madam Mo had been suffering in the Mo family recently. She felt especially aggrieved. Her mother-in-law, her two sons, and her husband were all treating her differently because of an outsider.

Old Madam told her to reflect.

Her husband also told her to reflect on herself.

But what was there to reflect on?

She didn’t think she’d done anything wrong.

Everything she did was for the good of the Mo family, but why did no one support her?

Instead, a little girl who was nothing had become the treasure of the family.
