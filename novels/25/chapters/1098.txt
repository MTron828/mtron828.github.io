Chapter 1099: The Old and the Young Sang the Same Tune

As for the things that Madam Mo cared about, Old Madam didn’t care about them.

She felt that it was fine as long as her grandson liked it.

As long as the woman wasn’t some random person, she could accept it.

Furthermore, Qiao Mianmian was very sweet-talking in front of her.

Hence, Old Madam Mo was very satisfied with this beautiful and sweet-mouthed granddaughter-in-law.

Compared to the Old Madam, Madam Mo, who was still sitting, had no expression on her face. This time, she didn’t even have the most basic polite smile on her face.

She looked at Qiao Mianmian with disgust and dissatisfaction.

She really did not understand why an intelligent person like the Old Madam would be fooled by a little girl.

Clearly, the Old Madam was also someone who paid particular attention to matching families.

Now, she wasn’t even bothered about Qiao Mianmian’s poor family background.

She even said that it was fine as long as her grandson liked her. Her background wasn’t important.

Since birth wasn’t important, why didn’t she get together with that poor boy back then? Instead, she married Elder Mo, whose family background was compatible with hers. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Even she herself had to be particular about matching families, but when it came to her grandson, she wasn’t particular.

The thought of Qiao Mianmian asking her to take out all of the Mo Corporation’s shares to divorce Mo Yesi infuriated her.

How could such a greedy woman be worthy of her precious son?

The more she thought about it, the angrier she got. She couldn’t help but say sourly, “Mom, don’t worry about her. No one dares to bully her. Your grandson treats her like a treasure. How can she be bullied by others?”

The Old Madam could hear the sourness in her words, but she pretended not to know. She turned to look at her and said with a smile, “Isn’t that so? Mianmian is Ah Si’s darling. As a husband, if he let others bully his wife, he’s not a qualified husband.”

“Besides...” The Old Madam didn’t seem to notice Madam Mo’s darkened face and continued to smile. “Mianmian is the daughter-in-law of our Mo family. If anyone dares to bully her, I will be the first to stand up for her. If the Mo family is bullied by others, wouldn’t that be a joke?”

Mo Yesi smiled and agreed. “Grandma is right.”

The old and the young sang the same tune.

And they were all on Qiao Mianmian’s side.

Madam Mo’s face darkened from anger. She felt like she had become an outsider in this family.

She was filled with anger, but in front of the Old Madam, she did not dare to vent it.

In this house, the person she feared the most was the Old Madam.

With the old lady around, she had to control her temper.

“Oh, right. Mianmian, I heard from Ah Si that your brother is here too.” The Old Madam didn’t care much about Madam Mo. After speaking to her for a while, her gaze landed on Qiao Chen, who was standing behind Qiao Mianmian.

After sizing him up, she said with a smile, “That handsome young man behind you is your younger brother?”

Qiao Mianmian pulled Qiao Chen out from behind her. “Grandma, this is my brother, Qiao Chen. He’s two years younger than me and is still in high school. Chen Chen, this is Grandma. Call her Grandma.”

Qiao Chen was scared and nervous at first.

However, when he met the old lady’s gentle and loving gaze, his nervousness lessened, and he was no longer that afraid.
