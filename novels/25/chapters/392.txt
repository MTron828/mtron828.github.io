Chapter 393: Sister, Are You Serious?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

There were so many good-looking men and women in the entertainment industry. It wasn’t uncommon for sparks to fly.

Many actors and actresses would even get together after having acted in the same show.

He’d also heard the news of these actors and actresses divorcing their husbands or wives after working with another colleague.

There were too many such examples.

His Baby was so beautiful inside and out, and he loved her so much for it, why wouldn’t others?

He really was worried about things on her end.

“I know that even without you telling me.” Qiao Mianmian nodded. “While we’re still officially married, I won’t do anything that embarrasses you. Don’t worry about that.”

Mo Yesi felt uncomfortable upon hearing this.

Did she mean that she’d consider accepting other men if they weren’t married anymore?

Even though it was logical, he wasn’t able to accept this.

She was his.

And she would be for the rest of her life.

Besides him, she couldn’t have any other man by her side. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Qiao Chen had to return to school after his discharge.

Qiao Chen got out of bed not too long after Qiao Mianmian came down.

Qiao Chen’s school was just two streets away from Qiao Mianmian’s. After breakfast, Mo Yesi sent the siblings to school together.

After a day of rest, Qiao Chen appeared to be a lot better.

He seemed less tired and restless than the previous day.

After getting in the car, Qiao Mianmian said to Mo Yesi in the driver’s seat, “Mr. Mo, thank you for sending Chen Chen and me to school.”

She sounded very polite and overly civil.

Qiao Chen sensed something wrong and frowned. “Sister, what did you call Brother-in-law?”

Qiao Mianmian smiled. “Mr. Mo.”

Qiao Chen asked, “... Since when did you become so polite to Brother-in-law?”

This wasn’t how they used to interact.

Qiao Mianmian smiled and was about to tell him about Mo Yesi pursuing her. But Mo Yesi beat her to it. “I’m pursuing your sister.”

“What?” Qiao Chen was extremely confused. “Pursuing my sister?”

“Yes.”

Qiao Chen was speechless.

Weren’t they already married?

What kind of operation was this?

“Sister, what happened between you and Brother-in-law? What do you mean?”

“It’s exactly what it sounds like.” Qiao Mianmian explained it to him, “Your Brother-in-law and I got married very soon after we met each other. He feels that he owes me a proper dating experience, so he’s making it up to me now.

“Our status for the moment isn’t husband and wife, and we aren’t even dating yet. So, maybe you shouldn’t call him Brother-in-law for now.”

Qiao Chen was speechless.

What nonsense was this!

“Sister, are you serious?”

“Yup.” Qiao Mianmian grinned. “I’m serious. You can call him Mr. Mo too, or Young Master Mo, or even Chairman Mo. When we’re a couple again, you can change it back to Brother-in-law.”

Qiao Chen was speechless.

Was this some kind of romantic idea between his sister and Brother-in-law?

They were already married, and they were starting from scratch now?

He found this a little... tacky.

But since they seemed to be rather immersed in their new characters, what was he to say anything as an outsider?

After all, this marriage was indeed a little rushed.
