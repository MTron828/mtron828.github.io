Chapter 704: I Don’t Want to... Harm Her

“In your fans’ eyes, you definitely weren’t the one who took the initiative. Then, she could only have pretended to fall to seduce you.”

Tu Yilei’s expression got colder and colder. He wanted to say something but couldn’t.

Because he knew that what Michael said was the truth.

This wouldn’t affect him much.

Everyone would think that Qiao Mianmian was trying to ride on his popularity.

Even her fall was seen as deliberate.

She would be seen as a scheming woman who wanted to make a name for herself through scandals.

“I’ll take note in the future.”

Tu Yilei kept quiet for a long while before looking at him pleadingly. “Michael, we have to help her this time. She’s still young and her career has just started, she can’t be ruined just because of me. I’m begging you, you have to help her, alright?

“I won’t take the initiative to look for her anymore. I’ll keep a distance from her.”

That was what Michael was waiting for.

Actually, how could he not be able to settle it?

If he couldn’t even handle such a small matter, he would have been fired a long time ago.

He made it sound so serious because he wanted to force Tu Yilei to say those words.

To keep a distance from Qiao Mianmian.

It didn’t matter how much he said.

Only by letting Tu Yilei know how Qiao Mianmian’s scandal would affect him would his restless heart settle down.

“Will you really keep your distance from her and not look for her anymore?”

“Yes.” Tu Yilei looked down, hiding the bitterness in his eyes. He smiled bitterly and said, “I won’t dare to look for her again. I don’t want to... harm her.”

If his love only brought her trouble, what else could he do besides giving up?

He couldn’t even bear to let others hurt her, how could he hurt her?

“Alright, I’ll remember that.” Michael looked him in the eye and said, “You said it yourself. I’ll help you settle this. But if there’s a next time, you don’t have to look for me anymore.”

It was Linda who told Qiao Mianmian about the scandal between her and Tu Yilei.

When she received Linda’s call and found out that the scandal between her and Tu Yilei had gone viral on Weibo, she was shocked.

“Sister Xie, are you saying that Tu Yilei and I are in a scandal?”

After getting Linda’s affirmation, she was still a little confused. “But what kind of scandals can we have? We... don’t have that kind of relationship?”

She tried her best to stay away from Tu Yilei.

When there was no chance, they didn’t communicate at all.

Moreover, even if they did interact, it wasn’t the time to be alone. There were other people around.

“Of course, I know that you and Tu Yilei don’t have that kind of relationship. But this matter is getting out of hand. His fans are saying that you’re trying to gain his popularity, but he hasn’t responded yet.

“In any case, the current situation is very disadvantageous to you. The company will send a public relations team to clear things up for you, but we don’t know how it will turn out. As you know, his female fans aren’t easy to deal with. They think you’re seducing Tu Yilei on purpose. Even if we clarify things, they won’t believe us.

“Don’t give any response for now. Wait and see how Tu Yilei reacts.”𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m
