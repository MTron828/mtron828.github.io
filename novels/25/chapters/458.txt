Even though Shen Rou never liked those girls, this was the first time she expressed her unhappiness so openly.

Gong Zeli was shocked the most.

He glanced at Shen Rou puzzledly.

Shen Rou was always a gentle and thoughtful woman in his eyes.

Her family also taught her how to behave well. She would have never done such things to anyone no matter how much she disliked them.

But she just...

For a short moment, Gong Zeli couldn’t recognize the Shen Rou in front of him.

After a moment of silence, Yan Shaoqing smiled, reverted back to his normal jovial manner, and said, “What’s the matter with you, Rou Rou? Why are you so angry? I have brought girls along during our previous outings. Why can’t I do it today?

“This little girl is really timid. You will frighten her like this.”

When he finished speaking, he lowered his head to glance at the model. He pinched her cheeks and said smilingly, “Don’t worry too much. Sister Rourou isn’t like this normally. She must have had a bad day. Didn’t you say that you wanted to buy something just now? Go on a shopping trip. I’ll call you later, alright?”

After he spoke, Yan Shaoqing took out his credit card, passed it to the model, and said, “Buy anything you want, it’s my early birthday present for you.”

The sad look on the model’s face turned into a smile when she saw the card that he was passing to her.

She took over the card and kissed him immediately. She then said softly, “Thanks, Young Master Yan. You’re the best. I’ll go shop around, then?”

Yan Shaoqing pinched her face again, nodded, and replied smilingly, “Go on, don’t worry about the money.”

The smile on the model’s face grew wider.

It was as though she was going to pin him to the ground and keep kissing him.

He was definitely like what the others said. He was really generous, especially towards the ladies.

He was completely different from the dirty stingy old man she was serving previously.

Not only was he rich and generous, but he was also handsome with a hot body as well.

She also heard that he was really good in bed.

The ladies who spent a night with him only had good comments regarding his skills. He was said to be the best out of all the sugar daddies.

She would be really happy to sleep with him.

The model took a long look at his handsome face and decided on the spot. She must be in his good books.

After she took the card, she left the place happily.

She was probably too excited over the shopping trip because she said goodbye to Shen Rou, causing her to frown more.

After the model left.

Yan Shaoqing started to unbutton his shirt. His neck was exposed, and the hickies on his collar came into view.

Shen Rou noticed it and scoffed. “Aren’t you afraid of getting STDs? How can you just sleep with everyone.”

“Young Lady Shen, I don’t think I’ve messed with you today,” Yan Shaoqing said as he sat next to Gong Zeli. He then adjusted to a comfortable position and continued, “Why are you so angry today? Who messed with you?”

He then turned to Gong Zeli and asked lazily, “Fourth Bro, did you mess with her?”
