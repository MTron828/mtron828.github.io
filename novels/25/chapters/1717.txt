Chapter 1719: Not Expect Him to Be So Good at Flirting

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Jiang Luoli was embarrassed. “Yes, I found it unbelievable too. I didn’t expect Mo Shixiu to be so good at flirting. I wonder who he learned it from.”

“Maybe he already knew how to do it. He didn’t even have to learn it.” Qiao Mianmian looked at her peach blossom face and burning eyes and was very happy for her. “Because you were with him, he couldn’t help but say those words to you.

Jiang Luoli was even more embarrassed. She covered her face and said, “Oh, Baby, stop teasing me.”

“Luo Luo, I’m happy for you.” Qiao Mianmian held her hand and smiled. “It seems like you’ll be my sister-in-law soon. Seeing you so happy with Mo Shixiu, I’m happy for you.

“Thankfully, you and Mo Shixiu ended up together. I was wrong this time.”

Back then, she wasn’t optimistic about Jiang Luoli and Mo Shixiu being together.

She even advised her not to date him. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Thankfully, Mo Shixiu was domineering. Otherwise, they might have missed each other.

That would be a pity.

“Baby, you can’t say that. You did it for my own good.” Jiang Luoli’s eyes softened as she thought of Mo Shixiu’s gentleness. “I also thought that Mo Shixiu and I would break up soon.

“The gap between us is too huge. Not only is there a gap in our family background, but there’s also a gap in our work circles, common topics, hobbies, and many other things.

“I think if Mo Shixiu hadn’t been accommodating and followed my footsteps, we might have already broken up.”

Thankfully, she found someone willing to accommodate her and change for her.

Otherwise, this relationship wouldn’t last.

Even if Mo Shixiu wasn’t biased towards Madam Mo, it was hard for them to continue.

Jiang Luoli wasn’t the sort to mistreat herself.

She wasn’t confident enough in her relationship. Unless Mo Shixiu gave her enough security, she would want to escape.

“Since he’s trying so hard to protect this relationship, I can’t just do nothing.” Jiang Luoli’s eyes flickered with determination. “As long as he doesn’t do anything to let me down, I won’t leave him.

“As for the others...” Jiang Luoli smiled. “I don’t care what they think.”

She was referring to Madam Mo.

“Baby, we haven’t seen each other in a long time. Let’s talk about something happier.” Jiang Luoli held Qiao Mianmian’s arm as they walked into the mall and changed the topic. “I saw that the audience’s evaluation of your drama was pretty good. When will it officially air? Tell me, and I’ll support you when the time comes.

“I saw your new movie. Baby, you’re amazing. Not only did you audition, but you even got the second female lead role. I knew it. Baby, you’re so capable. You’ve always lacked the opportunity. Now that you’re becoming popular and your career is developing, I’m really happy for you.”
