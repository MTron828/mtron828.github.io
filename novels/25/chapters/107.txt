Chapter 108: Jiang Luoli Must Apologize

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“You cheated on your own future wife and did such a disgusting and shameless thing, but not only do you not feel ashamed, but you even want to play the blame game and pour this dirty water on Mianmian! You’re so ridiculously shameless, does your mom even know!

“You have abalone and sea cucumbers in your house, and you still aren’t satisfied. Why do you have to eat dung in the pit? Even if you cheat, can’t you find someone of a higher standard, to go easy on the eyes.”

Jiang Luoli’s words were very rough, and she continued to scold him as Su Ze’s face turned extremely somber.

He was so angry that the green veins on his forehead burst out as he gritted his teeth. “Jiang Luoli, I want you to apologize for those words.”

Jiang Luoli tsked with disapproval. “Why should I apologize? Isn’t it true?”

Su Ze was very angry, his gaze threatening. “Okay. If you don’t apologize, then you can’t leave.”

After he finished speaking, he took out his mobile phone and made a phone call.

Soon, several bodyguards came over.

Jiang Luoli realized her current position and was a little flustered.

She took a step back. “Su Ze, what are you doing.”

“Apologize.” Su Ze was talking to her, but his eyes were on Qiao Mianmian. “Apologize to me for what you just said.”

“F*ck you, Su Ze, you’re really a scum!” Jiang Luoli gritted her teeth and said sternly, “You don’t dare to own up to your own actions? I have never seen a man like you!”

“Do you not want to live!” Su Ze’s eyes clouded over when he heard Jiang Luoli scold him “scum”, and he reached over to slap her face.

As the great young master of the Su family, he grew up always respected, and no one dared to scold him like this.

This Jiang Luoli thought that just because she was classmates with Qiao Mianmian, she could do anything she wanted.

He was going to teach her a lesson today.

“Su Ze, how dare you!” Qiao Mianmian saw it, stepped in front of Jiang Luoli to block her, and looked at Su Ze coldly. “The grand young master of the Su family, laying your hands on a woman in public. Do you really not know shame.”

Su Ze saw her stepping out to block her and his hazy eyes narrowed. “It was her who spoke out of place first. If I don’t teach her today, she really won’t know her position.”

“How did she speak out of place?”

Qiao Mianmian’s eyes were full of sarcasm. “She just said the truth. I told her these things. If you think that she should be taught a lesson, don’t you have to teach me too?”

Su Ze squeezed his lips tightly and lowered his hand back.

His face was still angry and his voice was cold. “Mianmian, I won’t lay a hand on you. But Jiang Luoli must apologize.”

“I won’t apologize to you.” Jiang Luoli clenched her fists tightly. “Why should I apologize to a scumbag like you! Mianmian has been with you for so many years, but not only did you betray her, but you’re still insulting her so much now. Su Ze, you’re not a human at all! Just do what you want to me, I’m not scared. Anyway, all scumbags like you don’t have a conscience. Is it not commonplace for y’all to beat people up in revenge?”

Jiang Luoli was very loud.

The cashier at the front desk and some customers passing by heard it.

When they heard her say “beat people up”, they turned their attention to Su Ze.

Someone whispered, “Isn’t that Su family’s young master? Is what that girl’s saying true?”
