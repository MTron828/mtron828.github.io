Chapter 821: You’ve Never Seen Me Before

If he saw her scandal with Gong Zeli, she would have to explain and coax him.

They chatted for a while more before hanging up.

After hanging up, an emotionless voice sounded at the same time. “Your manager called you? I heard you mention Fourth Gong. What does it have to do with him?”

Qiao Mianmian looked up.

She wanted to say that it wasn’t a big deal, but she knew that her scandals were already spreading like wildfire. If she didn’t tell him the truth, it would be even worse if he saw it himself.

After a few seconds of hesitation, she told him everything that happened.

“Anyway, it’s a coincidence that he and I were on the same flight. Don’t believe those hype things, they’re all fake.”

Mo Yesi’s expression didn’t change. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

He picked up his cell phone and logged into Weibo to search for the scandal between Qiao Mianmian and Gong Zeli.

After reading through the news, he turned it off.

The man looked up and asked coldly, “What’s with that eye mask?”

“Mm?” Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

Mo Yesi pursed his lips and frowned. He looked at her unhappily for a few seconds before saying, “You gave him an eye mask? Aren’t you on bad terms with Fourth Bro? Why did you give him something?”

What was most infuriating was that he had taken a look just now.

Gong Zeli’s eye mask and Qiao Mianmian’s were both pink.

One was a little rabbit and the other was a kitten.

It looked like they were wearing a couple eye mask.

Moreover, what was Fourth Gong looking at her with?

He wanted to gouge that guy’s eyes out.

How dare he stare at his wife like that.

Mo Yesi felt uncomfortable thinking about how Qiao Mianmian had never given him an eye mask.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Was he jealous again because of this?

In order to prevent him from getting jealous, she quickly got up and walked to his side. She held his arm and explained anxiously, “I was thinking that he helped me once, and that eye mask wasn’t anything valuable. He asked me where I got it from, so I gave him one.

“Really, I bought it on Taobao. It costs three yuan!”

The man’s expression was still tense, but because of the girl’s timely comfort, his expression was slightly better than before. “You can give me three for 10 yuan? You’ve never given me one before.”

He sounded a little aggrieved.

Qiao Mianmian almost burst out laughing.

Every time Mo Yesi got jealous, he was like a child.

It was very different from his usual image.

She once heard that men would only show their childish side when they really liked a woman.

Hence, although this man was always jealous and petty when it came to relationships, Qiao Mianmian’s heart softened when she thought about how he became jealous because he cared about her and liked her.

She couldn’t blame him at all.

“Then, what do you want?”

She looked at him in amusement and felt that Mo Yesi was really cute like this. Hence, when she coaxed him, she said in a child’s tone, “When you get off work, let’s go shopping. I’ll get you one too? Mm, I’ll get you an expensive one, alright?”
