Chapter 1746: I’d Rather Die Than Apologize to That Woman!

“What did you say?!” Shangguan Qing’s eyes widened in shock. “Y-You’re saying that vixen is Chairman Mo’s girlfriend? W-Who did you hear that from? How could it be true?

“She, she’s just a lousy actress. Also, if she’s really Mo Yesi’s girlfriend, why hasn’t she publicized their relationship?”

Shangguan Qing refused to believe it.

Chairman of the Mo Corporation?

How could such a distinguished man think highly of a small actress and make her his girlfriend?

Shangguan Hua was so angry that he slammed the table. “Can’t I even find out about this? She’s an actress, yes, but she has someone backing her up, and this person is someone we can’t afford to offend. Now, because of your willfulness, do you know how many losses you’ve caused the company?”

Shangguan Qing bit her lip and refused to believe it. “Even if she’s really Mo Yesi’s woman, she can’t be a serious girlfriend. Maybe he’s just playing with her.

“Dad, you’re taking her too seriously.”

Shangguan Hua was about to die of anger. “Do you know that Mo Yesi canceled our cooperation because he wanted to stand up for her? Do you know that this cooperation is very important to the company?

“Whether she’s Mo Yesi’s girlfriend or not, apologize to her immediately.”

“What?!” Shangguan Qing was in disbelief. “Dad, you want me to apologize to that vixen?” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“If you don’t apologize for the trouble you’ve caused, what will the company do?” Shangguan Hua’s tone was rarely firm. “This matter is settled. I’ll arrange a meal, and you can have a good talk with them.

“Stop calling her a vixen. No matter her identity, she has someone backing her now. Even if you look down on her, don’t be so obvious.”

“I don’t want to apologize to her.”

Shangguan Qing reacted strongly. “Why should I? I didn’t do anything wrong. Dad, I was the one who was bullied and wronged by them, and now you want me to apologize to that vixen. I won’t apologize to her even if I die.

“She’s just a lowly actress, she’s not worthy!”

Shangguan Hua couldn’t help but flare-up. “I used to let you do whatever you wanted. You caused trouble everywhere, and I cleaned up your messes. It seems like I spoiled you, that’s why you’re so insensible. Do you think I’m discussing this with you? Whether you’re willing or not, you have to apologize to her!

“If the company’s project can be salvaged, that’s fine. If it can’t, I’ll cancel all your benefits in the future!”

Shangguan Qing was so angry that her face turned purple. “I’d rather die than apologize to that woman!

“I will never apologize to her. Not in this lifetime.”

Shangguan Qing turned around and ran out of the office.

Outside.

Xu Jie immediately entered the office after Shangguan Qing left.

Seeing how angry Shangguan Hua was, he quickly said, “Chairman, your health is more important. Don’t be too angry.”
