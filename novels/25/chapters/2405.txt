Chapter 2406: But She Knew the Truth

“Mom, you know how the Mo family treated us back then, right? You begged Old Madam Mo, but she didn’t help us in the end.” Shen Rou gritted her teeth.

“Of course I know.”

Madam Shen’s expression darkened. “I was the one who begged Old Madam Mo. How could I not know?”

“The Mo family was so heartless to our Shen family. We’re irreconcilable enemies. But now, Shen Xin is actually interacting with them. She even likes that brat Mo and wants to be with him.

“Shen Xin, I’m telling you, you can be with any man, but not that brat Qiao Chen.

“Not only is he a member of the Mo family, but he’s also that slut’s brother. If you want to be with him, then you’re not a Shen anymore. I don’t have a sister like you.” Shen Rou was furious.

“What? Xiao Xin is with someone from the Mo family? The Qiao Chen you’re talking about… is he the one the Mo family acknowledged…”

“It’s him.”

Madam Mo attended the banquet that night.

Hence, she had an impression of Qiao Chen.

If the Mo and Shen families didn’t have such a relationship, she would definitely support Shen Xin and Qiao Chen.

But now…

Like Shen Rou, Madam Shen detested everyone from the Mo family.

“Xiao Xin, is this true?” Madam Shen turned around and frowned.

Shen Xin bit her lip. Her face grew even paler under the crystal lights.

“Say something.” Madam Shen raised her voice. “Is what your sister said true? Do you still like him?”

Shen Xin bit her lip until a bloody mark formed. She then opened her mouth and said, “Yes.”

Shen Rou sneered.

Madam Shen frowned even more. “Then, do you know that he’s a member of the Mo family now?”

“…I know.”

“Then, do you know that the woman who stole Mo Yesi from your sister is his sister?”

“I know. But Mom, Qiao Chen’s sister didn’t snatch Brother Yesi. She and Brother Yesi are a couple who like each other.” Shen Xin couldn’t help but defend herself. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Although Shen Rou was her sister, she knew the truth.

Shen Rou had always liked Mo Yesi, but he had never responded to her.

Hence, Mo Yesi and Shen Rou weren’t a couple. They were just friends.

Mo Yesi had never let Shen Rou down.

He had no obligation to respond to her feelings, just like how Qiao Chen had no obligation to respond to her feelings back then.

Shen Rou’s expression darkened. “Shen Xin, have you forgotten who you are? Your surname is Shen, and you’re my sister. How dare you speak up for that slut?

“Are you willing to give up your family for a man?”

“Sister, I didn’t mean that.” Shen Xin pursed her lips as her eyes reddened.
