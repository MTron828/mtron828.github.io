Chapter 534: Who Else Can She Like But You?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

They were shocked as they thought that the Young Master was dating an under-aged girl.

After he heard the response, he bit on his lip and kept silent.

“Do I look a lot older than Young Madam?”

Uncle Li’s shocked face was shown on the rearview mirror as he said, “Young Master, you’re still young. How would you look old? If you look old, how about old men like me who are older than fifty?”

“But...” Mo Yesi clenched his fists. “She looks a lot younger than me. Do you think she feels that I’m older than her and we’re from different generations?”

Uncle Li was speechless.

“Young Master, how could you think that way? You’re a hell of a guy. Countless women are attracted to you. The small difference in age between Young Madam and you isn’t an issue at all.

“Your other qualities make up for this difference.”

“Is that so?”

Mo Yesi’s usual self-confidence was gone. “Does she really not mind? Does she not feel that I’m a dull person and our lives together will be uninteresting?”

She was the first woman in his life.

She was also the first woman he fell in love with.

Unlike Yan Shaoqing, he didn’t have much experience with relationships. He had no idea how to make a girl happy.

He had to look up the web to know what to do for their first date.

How could she be happy with someone who didn’t have any experience, who didn’t know how to make her happy, and who was older than her by six years?

“Young Master, you’re overthinking. You’re one in a million. Young Madam surely loves you. There aren’t any guys around who can hope to match up to you.” It was the first time Uncle Li saw Mo Yesi so insecure. He was shocked.

This wasn’t like the young master he knew.

Since when was the young master so insecure?

“You think she likes me?” Still unconfident, Mo Yesi asked. “Uncle Li, are you trying to comfort me?”

Was Qiao Mianmian in love with him?

Mo Yesi couldn’t feel it at all.

She definitely didn’t hate him. But he couldn’t feel that she was in love with him.

“Yes, Young Master.” Uncle Li assured him. “Young Madam must be in love with you. You have such excellent qualities, and you’ve treated her so well. There’s no reason why she wouldn’t love you. Young Master, be confident. What’s there to worry about? You’re way better compared to the guys around Young Madam. Who else can she like but you?”

Uncle Li was confident that no one could hold a candle to his young master.

His young master had many talents.

He must be chosen by the gods.

No one around his age could hold a candle to his wealth, looks, and abilities.

The young lads around the young madam could not hope to match up to him.

If Uncle Li was in Mo Yesi’s shoes, he would have nothing to worry about.

He would be so happy if he could just be as good-looking as him. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

But he was born with his current looks and could never hope to be as good-looking as him.

He could only hope for it in his next life.

“Is that so?”

Uncle Li’s words sent Mo Yesi into deep thought. What Uncle Li said was true and logical.

But...

Mo Yesi was confident that he could handle everything. But when it came to Qiao Mianmian, he wasn’t so confident anymore.
