Chapter 1096: Don’t Worry With Your Brother-in-Law Around

He knew that Qiao Mianmian liked the Old Madam, so he brought her up.

As expected, Qiao Mianmian finally said, “I haven’t seen Grandma in a while, and I miss her a lot. Then, I’ll go back with you. But Chen Chen...”

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t bear to leave Qiao Chen alone.

“Sister, don’t worry about me. You can leave with Brother-in-law. I can eat alone,” Qiao Chen said sensibly.

No matter how close he was to Qiao Mianmian, he knew that his sister had a family now and was different from before.

Now that she had a husband, she naturally had to prioritize her family.

But the more sensible he was, the more Qiao Mianmian couldn’t bear to leave him alone.

The siblings hadn’t seen each other for some time.

They had just met, yet they were going to separate again.

How could she bear to?

Mo Yesi could tell that she couldn’t bear to leave Qiao Chen. He thought for a while and said, “Chen Chen, come with us. Your sister and I are already married, so we’re a family now. You haven’t met anyone else in my family.”

Qiao Chen’s expression changed. “Brother-in-law, I don’t think so.”

He was so nervous. “You guys really don’t have to worry about me. I’m usually alone. I’m used to it.”

Qiao Chen was instinctively afraid of meeting his elders.

Moreover, she was the elder on his brother-in-law’s side. He was even more terrified.

“Come with us.” Mo Yesi had a strong personality, so he didn’t care if he was willing or not. “You’ll have to go sooner or later. You might as well go earlier.”

“Brother-in-law, I, I...” Qiao Chen’s face turned a little pale. He still wanted to reject him. “I really don’t have to go. I’m not prepared at all. I...”

“There’s no need for you to prepare anything.” Mo Yesi looked at his frightened expression and smiled. “It’s just a normal meal. Don’t worry. Besides, what are you afraid of? My family isn’t a monster. They won’t do anything to you.”

“With me and your sister around, would you be afraid of anyone not giving you face?”

Qiao Chen: “... No.”

He was simply nervous and afraid.

Considering how wealthy his brother-in-law was, he was definitely not from an ordinary family.

Then, his family must not be ordinary people.

“Sister, must I go?” Qiao Chen could tell that there was no point in refusing Mo Yesi. He could only turn to Qiao Mianmian for help.

Qiao Mianmian never thought that Mo Yesi would ask Qiao Chen to go with them.

She hesitated and asked softly, “Chen Chen, can you come with us?”

“There’s nothing bad about it.” Mo Yesi reached out to touch her head. “Our families will meet sooner or later. It’s just dinner, you don’t have to be too nervous. Be more casual.”

Qiao Mianmian hesitated for a few seconds before nodding. “Alright, then.”

She turned around and said to Qiao Chen, “Chen Chen, come with us then.”

Qiao Chen wailed. “Sister...”

Qiao Mianmian smiled. “Don’t worry, your brother-in-law is here.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Actually, Qiao Mianmian didn’t really want Qiao Chen to go with them.

She wasn’t worried about anything else, but she was worried that Madam Mo would make Qiao Chen suffer.

Madam Mo didn’t like her, so she naturally wouldn’t like Qiao Chen.

It wasn’t a big deal for her to suffer at Madam Mo’s hands. But she couldn’t bear to let Qiao Chen suffer as well.

But Mo Yesi was right.
