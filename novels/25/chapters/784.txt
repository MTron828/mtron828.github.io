Chapter 785: Meeting Gong Zeli on the Plane

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

He was different from other playboys.

He was a rich second-generation heir.

But reality gave her a tight slap.

Gong Zeli didn’t hear any response from Qiao Mianmian and turned to look at her.

The girl had a beautiful face.

Her side profile was naturally beautiful.

Gong Zeli was so close to her that he could see the arc of her eyelashes.

Her long and curly eyelashes were so beautiful that it looked as if they had been peeled off from a doll’s eyes.

He’d never seen a woman with skin as good as Qiao Mianmian’s.

Her skin was so fair that it was practically glowing.

With Gong Zeli’s status, there was no lack of beauties around him.

He grew up with them.

But he had to admit that he’d been stunned by this girl before.

He finally understood why a blockhead like Mo Yesi would fall for her.

A sweet scent wafted to his nose from time to time.

The familiar scent reminded him of that night 10 years ago.

“Can I ask you a question?” He couldn’t help but ask.

Recently, he felt an inexplicable sense of anxiety.

He didn’t know why he was so anxious.

He was anxious to know if he’d made a mistake on that night 10 years ago.

But the more he wanted to confirm and find out the truth, the more he couldn’t.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t want to bother about him.

Even though he’d helped her once, he was still on Shen Rou’s side and had a good relationship with her.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t want to interact too much with such people.

But it didn’t seem right for her to ignore him when he kept talking to her.

She still replied, “What?”

“Did you attend any banquets when you were young?”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

Was this what he wanted to ask?

Of course, she had attended a banquet.

Although the Qiao family wasn’t rich, they were still much better than the ordinary people in their decline.

She attended all sorts of banquets.

As the First Miss of the Qiao family, Father Qiao would always bring her along.

Although she felt that Gong Zeli’s question was a little strange, she still replied, “Mm, of course.”

Gong Zeli kept quiet for a while before asking, “... Have you attended the Gong family’s banquet?”

“Gong family?”

Qiao Mianmian turned to look at him strangely.

Gong Zeli looked at her and nodded. “Yes. Have you attended the Gong family’s banquet? About 10 years ago.

“Do you remember?”

He felt that Qiao Mianmian should remember it.

Ten years ago, she was almost 10 years old.

She wasn’t too young.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but ask, “Mr. Gong, what exactly do you want to ask?” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He first asked if she attended the banquet, and then asked if she attended the Gong family’s banquet.

What was he trying to do?

“Answer me first.” Gong Zeli clenched his fists. This was the first time he felt so nervous.

He looked at Qiao Mianmian steadily. “Think about it carefully. Ten years ago, you were about 10 years old. Did you attend the Gong family’s banquet? It was in the summer.”
