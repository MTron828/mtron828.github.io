Chapter 1076: I’m Afraid She’ll Think He’s a Pervert

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“I think she might be our Xiaoqi.”

“Mom, don’t get agitated.” Bai Yusheng looked at Madam Bai helplessly. “There’s no such thing as a coincidence in this world. Although I really wish she was my sister, the possibility is small.”

He didn’t want Madam Bai to have high hopes and be disappointed in the end.

This wasn’t the first time something like this had happened.

The greater the hope, the greater the disappointment.

“Little Five, when I entrusted your sister to someone else, I thought of going to fetch her back immediately after our family’s crisis was over. But at that time, I didn’t know if we could survive that crisis. If we could, how long would it take?

“Thus, in order to prevent me from mistaking you for someone else in the future, I left a mark on your younger sister.

“As long as we can confirm that she has that birthmark, she will definitely be your sister.”

As Madam Bai spoke, she excitedly grabbed Bai Yusheng’s hand. “Little Five, if you want to know if she’s Little Seven, you only need to know if she has that mark.”

This was the first time Bai Yusheng had heard of this. He couldn’t help but be surprised. “Mark? Mom, what mark are you talking about?”

“A mole.” Madam Bai took a deep breath and suppressed her excitement. “A red mole. I made it myself. The position is on her butt. I forgot whether it’s on the left or right. It’s on her butt, anyway.”

Bai Yusheng: “...”

A mole on her butt?

How could he confirm this? 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Could he ask Qiao Mianmian if she had a red mole on her butt?

She would probably think that he was a pervert.

As soon as Madam Bai finished speaking, she thought of this and frowned slightly. “You can’t ask about this. However, it’s not difficult to confirm it. How about this? Find a time to bring her to our house and I’ll confirm it.”

Bai Yusheng had originally thought that such a coincidence was impossible.

But now that he heard what Madam Bai said, his initial nonchalance turned serious.

He had never known about the existence of this mark before.

This was the first time Mrs. Bai had mentioned this to him.

“Mom, isn’t there going to be a birthday party in two days? I’ll invite her over, then.” Bai Yusheng lowered his eyes and thought for a while before continuing, “When the time comes, how to confirm it will depend on you.”

“Okay.” Madam Bai clenched her fists and couldn’t wait any longer. “I will arrange everything in advance. If, if she’s Xiaoqi, I will dote on her, love her, and do my best to give her the best life.

“I won’t let her suffer for the rest of her life.

“From now on, she will be the glamorous daughter of the Bai family and the apple of our eyes.”

At the corner of the hall.

A white figure stood in the corner for a while. After Madam Bai and Bai Yusheng finished their conversation, the white figure quietly left.

...

In the car.

Shen Rou received a text message. She opened it and, after reading it, her expression changed.

Madam Shen, who was sitting beside her, noticed that something was wrong. She immediately asked, “Rourou, what’s wrong? Are you feeling unwell again?”

Shen Rou shook her head and thought about the text message she had just read. She pursed her lips tightly and remained silent for a while. She gripped her phone tightly and asked, “Mom, do you know that the Bai family lost a daughter?”
