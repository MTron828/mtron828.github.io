Chapter 1088: Even If He Doesn’t Like Her, He Can’t Offend Her

Actually, without Wei Zheng, it would affect his work.

However, if it was just a day or two, he could still tolerate it.

“It’s settled, then. I’ll get Wei Zheng to go with you. He’s my most capable assistant and has always been reliable. I’ll only be at ease if he’s with you.” Mo Yesi didn’t give her any chance to hesitate and forcefully settled the matter.

He called Wei Zheng and told him what happened.

Although Qiao Mianmian thought he was exaggerating, she didn’t reject him.

If this was the only way to reassure him, then she would do as he wished.

Anyway, it didn’t matter if Wei Zheng was with her.

As long as he didn’t feel that it would affect his work.

...

A few hours later.

Qiao Mianmian arrived at F City with Wei Zheng.

Mo Yesi arranged for someone to welcome them after they got off the plane and sent them to the hospital.

Mo Yesi was probably really afraid that the reporters would find out.

Not only did he arrange for someone to take them to the hospital, but he also arranged for someone to welcome them.

The director personally came out to pick her up and entered the hospital through the back door.

Qiao Mianmian understood Tu Yilei’s situation for the past two days. When they walked out of Tu Yilei’s ward, they bumped into Mike.

Mike frowned when he saw Qiao Mianmian.

However, when he thought about her relationship with Mo Yesi, he could only suppress his unhappiness.

Many of Tu Yilei’s resources after his comeback depended on that man surnamed Mo.

Qiao Mianmian was now that man’s girlfriend.

No matter how much he disliked her, he couldn’t offend her.

Nothing was more important than his Little Tu’s career. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

After weighing the pros and cons, Mike took the initiative to go forward and greet her. “Hello, Miss Qiao. Are you here to see Little Tu?”

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian knew that Mike didn’t like her, so she didn’t beat around the bush. “Is Senior Tu resting? Can we go in and see him?”

Mike hesitated, then nodded. “He just woke up a little while ago. Go on in.”

He turned to look at Wei Zheng beside her. “Miss Qiao, this gentleman beside you is...”

“Hello, my name is Wei Zheng.” Without waiting for Qiao Mianmian to introduce him, Wei Zheng generously extended his hand. “I’m President Mo’s assistant. This time, President Mo specially instructed me to accompany Miss Qiao.”

“So, it’s Assistant Wei.” Mike extended his hand and said half-jokingly, “Is President Mo so worried about Miss Qiao? Is he afraid that she will be bullied here?”

Wei Zheng smiled. “Ever since what happened last time, President Mo has been worried about Miss Qiao traveling alone. Speaking of which, it was all thanks to Mr. Tu that Miss Qiao is safe and sound. Regarding this, President Mo is very grateful. He said that Mr. Tu is Miss Qiao’s great benefactor and will definitely repay him on her behalf.”

Mike was a smart man.

How could he not understand what Wei Zheng meant?

He had already met Mo Yesi twice. Although he didn’t know him well, he had a basic impression of him.

He was a possessive and domineering man.

He had probably seen through Little Tu’s thoughts.

That was why he asked his assistant to accompany her this time.

The assistant might have meant what he said.
