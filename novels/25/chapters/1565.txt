Chapter 1566: I’m Sorry, I Didn’t Do It on Purpose

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Song Fang looked awful.

The other artistes were shocked at first, but then felt that this was normal.

Qiao Anxin heard him clearly this time.

She widened her eyes in shock. “What right do you have to revoke my audition qualifications?”

“The leader said so.”

“What leader? Which leader? I don’t believe it.” Qiao Anxin took so much effort to get this audition slot, how could she give it up so easily? She said with a black face, “You must have decided on your own accord to take revenge on me. I don’t believe it. Call your leader out, I want to ask him face to face.”

The staff member lost his patience and his expression turned cold. “Who are you? Director Cheng isn’t someone you can see whenever you want. Security, take her away immediately. Leave no irrelevant personnel here!”

Two security officers immediately went forward and said in an unpleasant tone, “Miss, are you leaving by yourself, or do we ‘invite’ you out?”

“Please.”

Anyone who wasn’t a fool would know that the security guard didn’t really mean to “invite” her to leave.

No matter how slow-witted Qiao Anxin was, she could still understand his meaning.

Her expression turned awful as she bit her lip.

Her eyes were red as she looked at the employee pitifully. “I’m sorry, I didn’t do it on purpose. I don’t mean to blame you. I just don’t like Qiao Mianmian, it’s not...”

This was an important opportunity for Qiao Anxin.

She didn’t want to lose it.

Qiao Anxin finally panicked when he called the security officers.

She was afraid that she would really be chased away.

She was afraid that she would lose this opportunity.

On one hand, she was faking it. On the other hand, she was really afraid.

But no matter why she was crying, the crew member wasn’t moved at all. He said expressionlessly to the security officers, “What are you waiting for? Get her out of here immediately.”

The security officers didn’t dare to delay.

Seeing that Qiao Anxin wasn’t willing to leave, they didn’t stand on ceremony with her anymore. they went forward and held her on both sides. “Miss, please leave.”

Although they said “please”, they didn’t care if Qiao Anxin was willing or not. They carried her towards the elevator.

Qiao Anxin felt embarrassed to be chased away with so many people watching. She struggled and said, “Let go of me, let go of me. What are you doing?”

“Who are you to treat me like this? I’m going to sue you!”

“Let go, did you hear me!”

Song Fang felt embarrassed.

She was furious.

Qiao Anxin was such a dumb pig. It wasn’t easy for her to get this audition slot, but she was so stupid to lose it. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

How could she, Song Fang, think of bringing such a stupid woman along?

With her IQ, it was just as Linda said. She used to rely on Su Ze to support her.

If she relied on her own abilities, she might not even be a C-list celebrity.

The others started whispering again.

Song Fang turned around and left.

...

With Qiao Anxin’s departure, this episode was over.

The employee turned around and looked at the others expressionlessly. “Anyone else has any objections? You can say it all at once.”

The other actors were speechless.

Was he even human?
