Qiao Mianmian: [Answer me first.]

Jiang Luoli: [Mm, didn’t I tell you?]

Qiao Mianmian: [Why can you get pregnant after doing it with Mo Shixiu just once!! Mo Yesi tormented me so many times every day, why is my stomach so flat?]

Jiang Luoli: [So you’re trying to show off that you and Prince Charming not only have sex every day but also many times during the day?]

Qiao Mianmian’s lips twitched.

Could Jiang Luoli not tell that she was complaining!

She wasn’t showing off at all.

Qiao Mianmian: [I’m not showing off. Luo Luo, you don’t know how terrible I’ve been recently. Your Prince Charming wants a child so badly that his bones are about to fall apart. I can’t understand why we’ve prepared everything well, but there’s no good news. You and Mo Shixiu didn’t even think of having a child back then, but you got pregnant in one go.]

Jiang Luoli: [Did you consider your ovulation period?]

Qiao Mianmian: [Forget it, it must be calculated. Mo Yesi remembers my ovulation period better than me.]

Jiang Luoli: [Have you and Prince Charming gone to the hospital for a check-up?]

Qiao Mianmian: [Go to the hospital for a check-up?]

Jiang Luoli: [Yeah. You and Prince Charming are still young. I think Prince Charming is in good health, too. Logically speaking, it should be easy for him to get you pregnant. I suggest that you both go to the hospital for a check-up. If there’s nothing wrong with both of your bodies, there’s no need to be anxious. You should be more at ease about this. The more anxious you are, the easier it will be to go against your wishes.]

Qiao Mianmian never thought of going to the hospital for a check-up.

She had never thought that not being able to have a child had something to do with the body.

She and Mo Yesi were still young and healthy.

But…

Seeing Jiang Luoli’s reply, she really suspected that there was something wrong with her and Mo Yesi.

Mo Yesi worked out all year round. Every time he tormented her until she was half-dead, he would still look energetic.

Hence, the possibility of Mo Yesi having a problem was very low.

Was there something wrong with her body?

Qiao Mianmian’s heart sank.

If there was really something wrong with her body and she couldn’t get pregnant, then she and Mo Yesi…

…

Mo Yesi came back from work.

As soon as he entered the hall, Lei En, the butler, walked up to him and greeted him respectfully. He then looked up at him hesitantly.

He seemed to have something to say.

“Just say it.” Mo Yesi could tell that he had something to say. He handed Lei En his suitcase and walked towards the staircase. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Lei En kept half a step behind him.

“Young Master, Young Madam seems to be in a bad mood. She’s been sitting in the garden for the whole afternoon.”

Mo Yesi stopped in his tracks and turned around. “Young Madam sat in the garden all afternoon?”

“Yes, it seems like something is bothering her.”

“She’s still in the garden?”

“Yes.”

Mo Yesi frowned and walked towards the garden without changing his clothes.

…

“Young Madam, the garden is humid at night. You’ve been sitting in the garden for so long, you should go back inside.”

A housemaid approached Qiao Mianmian and whispered to her.

“Don’t worry about me.” Qiao Mianmian looked at the housemaid, who had told her to go back inside for the third time..
