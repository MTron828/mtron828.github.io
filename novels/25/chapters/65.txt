Chapter 66: Whoa, Who’s That Group of People?

They were all hooligans.

Seeing that Jiang Luoli wasn’t too bad herself, they sneered. “You’re not bad looking. Brother Du, how about we take her along and let the buddies have some fun?”

Qiao Mianmian’s expression changed immediately when she saw that Jiang Luoli was being held too.

She gave Du Ze a tight slap to the face. “You trash, let go of Luo Luo.”

Pah!

Du Ze did not manage to evade it in time and now looked up with an evil look.

He clenched his teeth. “Bitch, you hit me! I’ve got to kill you today!”

With that, he grabbed Qiao Mianmian’s hair and swung her towards the wall.

Qiao Mianmian then turned around and bit his arm, making him release her in a moment of pain.

He was strong.

And so was Qiao Mianmian, for a girl.

But given the force he used, she staggered backward and fell to the ground.

Du Ze saw the bite mark on his arm and how it bled and reached for the knife in his bag.

There were many students around.

But not a single one of them went forward to help. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Qiao Mianmian’s expression changed when she saw that Du Ze was now holding a knife.

Shen Yueyue and Zhao Wanting, on the other hand, looked smug now. “Serves you right, you slut.”

“Brother Du Ze, teach this slut a lesson!”

“It’s best if you slice her face! Then she won’t be able to seduce other men ever again!”

Du Ze growled at his underlings. “Pull her up. I’m going to kill her.”

The few men rolled up their sleeves and walked towards Qiao Mianmian.

Before they even got to her, a flurry of footsteps could be heard approaching.

The students standing around were caught by surprise. “Whoa, who’s that group of people?”

“They don’t look like Shen Yueyue’s men, though.”

Hearing the commotion, Du Ze and Shen Yueyue turned around and saw a group of big, burly men in black uniforms approaching them.

There were about 10 of them.

Each of them was above 1.85m in height, and their physique was proof of how much training they had gone through.

They looked impressive.

A few notches above the people Shen Yueyue brought.

Before they could figure out why men in black were there, they heard one of them say, “Young Master has ordered us not to let anyone of you go today.”

Right after he said that the group swiftly made their move.

The few of them who were about to grab Qiao Mianmian were held first. Then, screams of agony and muffled sounds of bones breaking could be heard, and then three of the hooligans were seen on the ground.

The rest of the hooligans went forward to help.

But each of them was beaten to the ground before they even made their move.

Sounds of bones breaking could be heard.

The men lying on the floor sounded like pigs being slaughtered, and some of them had even passed out from the pain.

It was only a moment’s work.

The men in black didn’t seem to have done much, but Du Ze’s men were all on the ground.

Seeing this scene before them, the students’ jaws dropped. They were so fearful, they hadn’t realized they were holding their breaths.

This group of people... was here for Qiao Mianmian?
