Chapter 1631: I’m Worried Something Happened to Luo Luo

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“I heard he’s from the Mo family’s branch family. He must be from a rich family. He’s so handsome, rich, and so good to her. She’s so lucky.”

“What luck? Since he’s from the Mo family, do you think she can marry into the family? The Mo family is such a prestigious family, it’s impossible to let a small artiste enter.”

“That’s true. With the Mo family’s status, they’d definitely find someone of equal social status.” The women who were envious of Qiao Mianmian felt a little better now.

A small artiste like Qiao Mianmian couldn’t marry into the Mo family.

No matter how well her boyfriend treated her, he still had to marry another woman.

Cinderella’s story was a fairytale, after all.

How could there be so many fairy tales in real life?

But even if she couldn’t marry into the Mo family in the future, Qiao Mianmian wouldn’t suffer any losses.

It was a good thing to be in a relationship with such an outstanding man.

Moreover, her boyfriend was very generous to her. When they broke up, she probably wouldn’t be aggrieved by the compensation.

...

They left the set.

Mo Yesi got Wei Zheng to arrange the restaurant for their date.

It was a restaurant halfway up the mountain. It was a little far from the city and was rather remote.

But the environment was elegant and quiet. Moreover, after dinner, they could watch the stars in the observatory.

Mo Yesi felt that Qiao Mianmian would definitely like it.

After Qiao Mianmian got into the car, she thought about how Jiang Luoli hadn’t contacted her for the past few days and couldn’t help but feel strange. She sent Jiang Luoli a WeChat message.

Jiang Luoli would complain to her every day.

Even if there was nothing else, they would talk about their daily lives.

But this time, Jiang Luoli hadn’t contacted her for two whole days.

Although it wasn’t strange, Qiao Mianmian still felt that it wasn’t normal.

Jiang Luoli didn’t reply to her message.

Qiao Mianmian felt a little uneasy.

She called Jiang Luoli.

A robotic female voice sounded from the phone. “Hello, the number you’ve dialed is switched off.”

Qiao Mianmian felt even more uneasy when she heard that.

Her expression changed.

Beside her, Mo Yesi quickly noticed her abnormality. He stopped the car while waiting for a red light and turned to look at her. “What’s wrong? Did something happen?”

Qiao Mianmian nodded. “I’m worried something happened to Luo Luo.”

“Jiang Luoli?” Mo Yesi was stunned. “What happened to her?” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Qiao Mianmian bit her lip and said, “I sent her a WeChat message just now, but she didn’t reply. I called her, but her phone is turned off.”

“So it’s because of this.” Mo Yesi chuckled. “Isn’t this very normal? Perhaps her cell phone ran out of battery. Are you too nervous?”

“No.” Qiao Mianmian’s voice was firm. “Luo Luo hasn’t contacted me for two days. She usually takes the initiative to chat with me every day. Moreover, her cell phone rarely runs out of battery. I just feel that something happened to her.

“Mo Yesi, I’m really worried that something happened to Luo Luo.”

“Don’t worry.” Mo Yesi placed a hand on her shoulder and comforted her. “I’ll call Big Brother.”
