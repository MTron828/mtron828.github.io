Chapter 719: Don’t Touch This Man

She wanted the other fans to stop doing things that would affect Tu Yilei’s reputation.

In any case, Tu Yilei’s post had its pros and cons.

The advantage was that some of the fans would listen to him and stop more fans from doing crazy things.

The downside was that once he posted it on Weibo, their scandal was confirmed.

Many people were wondering if he liked her.

After all, there were so many female artistes trying to ride on his coattails, why was he only speaking up for her?

Qiao Mianmian looked at Weibo for a while and frowned. If Mo Yesi saw this, he’d be even more jealous.

Tu Yilei finally cleared things up.

It was now Qiao Mianmian’s turn to speak.

Just as she was thinking about what to post on Weibo, Linda called again.

Qiao Mianmian immediately picked it up.

“Why didn’t you pick up my call just now, where did you go? Tu Yilei responded, did you see it? You talked to him?”

Linda asked a few questions.

Qiao Mianmian threw the wet towel on the bedside table and got up to look for the hairdryer. As she walked, she said, “Sister Xie, I went to shower just now. I saw Tu Yilei’s response, and I was wondering how I should reply to it.”

Linda asked again, “Did he help you because you talked to him?”

“... No.”

“You didn’t talk to him?” Linda was a little shocked. “He helped you out of his own accord?”

Qiao Mianmian went silent for a while before replying.

Linda was also silent for a few seconds before saying, “In the past, other female artistes had scandals with him, but he never said anything. Could he... really have fallen for you?”

“Sister Xie, I...” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Whether he really likes you or not, don’t touch this man. Stay away from him.” Linda’s tone turned serious. “You can’t afford to offend his fans. This is just a small scandal, and they want to kill you. If they find out that Tu Yilei likes you, you won’t have to be in the entertainment industry anymore.”

After this incident, Qiao Mianmian knew how scary Tu Yilei’s female fans were.

She already had a husband.

Even if she was still single, she wouldn’t dare to have anything with Tu Yilei.

She really... couldn’t afford to offend his female fans.

“Sister Xie, don’t worry. I don’t have any feelings for him. I’ll try my best to stay away from him.”

Her life was more important.

She’d wanted to be friends with Tu Yilei.

But now, it seemed like they couldn’t even be friends anymore.

“Since he has already responded, you can just send him a thank-you message. Make it casual and simple. Once you post it on Weibo, don’t bother about it anymore. It’s just a matter of a day or two, it’ll be fine.”

“Mm.”

“Come to think of it, although you didn’t intend to ride on his popularity, you did. Have you seen your Weibo fans?”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “No.”

“You can take a look now. I finally understand why so many female artistes are willing to risk being torn apart by his female fans to gain his popularity.”

“... Alright, I’ll go take a look later.”

Qiao Mianmian hung up and logged onto Weibo again.

When she entered her account, she was a little stunned when she saw the increasing number of followers.
