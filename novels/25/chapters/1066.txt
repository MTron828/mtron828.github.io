Chapter 1067: His Mom Really Wanted to Matchmake Him With Shen Rou

Madam Shen took a sip of the tea on the coffee table and wiped her lips elegantly with a handkerchief before putting the teacup back.

Madam Bai looked up at the clock on the wall and frowned. She was about to call someone when she heard footsteps coming in.

She turned around and saw Bai Yusheng walking in. She smiled and immediately walked towards him. “Little Five, you’re back. Have you eaten? Do you want the chef to prepare supper for you?”

Bai Yusheng wasn’t ranked fifth.

Besides her daughter, the Bai family only had one son.

She called him Little Five because his health was poor when he was young. A master said that by calling him that, he wouldn’t be weak anymore.

When he grew up and got better, Madam Bai was already used to calling him by that name.

“Mom, I came back after dinner.” Bai Yusheng casually glanced at the living room and saw Madam Shen, Shen Rou, and Shen Xin sitting in the living room. He pretended to be surprised and said, “There are actually guests at home?”

Madam Bai smiled and held his hand as they walked to the sofa. “Madam Shen and your two sisters are here, quickly greet them.”

Bai Yusheng nodded and said, “Hello, Aunt Shen. Hello, sisters.”

Madam Shen looked up and smiled elegantly. “Yusheng, did you just come back from work? Your mom and I were just talking about you. You’re back.”

“Oh?” Bai Yusheng pretended to be puzzled. “Aunt Shen and my mom talked about me? What did you guys say? No wonder I felt my ears burning just now. So, that’s what happened.”

Madam Shen smiled. “Nothing much, we were just chatting casually.”

Bai Yusheng nodded and didn’t ask further.

“Hello, Big Brother Bai.” Shen Xin, who was sitting at the side, seemed a little uneasy.

In comparison, Shen Rou, as the older sister, was more gracious. She nodded at Bai Yusheng and smiled. “Brother Bai.”

“Rourou, do you find it boring to be with us two old women? It just so happens that Little Five is back too. I’ll get him to take you for a walk in the garden? You two must have more topics to talk about since you’re younger.”

“That’s right, Rourou, you should go for a walk with Yusheng. Xinxin should just stay by my side. Both of you are so many years older than her. As the saying goes, a generation gap exists between three years old. She probably doesn’t have much to talk to you about, so she might as well accompany us.”

Madam Bai and Madam Shen were obviously trying to get it right.

Bai Yusheng originally thought that the butler’s words weren’t trustworthy.

Now, he believed it.

His mother really wanted to matchmake him with Shen Rou. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

And Madam Shen actually meant the same thing.

The Bai and Shen families were well-matched in terms of social status.

Shen Rou was one of the most eligible heiresses.

If Madam Shen really had such intentions, his mother would definitely not reject her.

But Bai Yusheng had never thought of having anything to do with Shen Rou. Not to mention whether Shen Rou was his type, he couldn’t possibly have anything to do with a woman who already had someone in mind.

Bai Yusheng didn’t express his rejection.

He had to maintain his image.

No one could force him to do anything he didn’t want to do.
