Chapter 559: The Only Heir of the Gong Family

“So be it, then.” Shen Rou swirled the blue liquid in her glass and smiled mockingly. “I just want to get drunk right now. When I’m drunk... I won’t feel so terrible anymore. Two more glasses.”

She downed the drink and raised her empty glass, asking for more.

The bartender hesitated.

This Young Lady Shen wasn’t just anyone.

If she got drunk and ran into some kind of trouble, their bar couldn’t bear that sort of responsibility.

Let alone a bartender like himself.

Just as he was deliberating, Shen Rou yelled, “The drink, get me one more. What are you waiting for, you think I can’t pay for it?”

She took out her wallet from her bag and whipped out a golden card, slamming it on the counter. “This card is full of money, get me the drink!”

The bartender seemed to be caught in a fix. “Miss Shen, you’ll really get drunk if you go on this way.”

The bartender was worried that she’d be in trouble.

But he was also afraid to offend Young Lady Shen.

Just as the bartender was deciding whether to serve her another drink, he saw a familiar figure. He couldn’t be happier as he greeted him. “Young Master Gong.”

“Rourou, what are you doing.”

Gong Zeli was in a black top and black pants. His top few buttons were undone, and he had his hands in his pockets.

Under the light, his ear stud shimmered.

He looked casual and charming under the dim light. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

No matter where and how he stood, he made people’s hearts race.

His appearance had many women turn around to look at him. They looked on in excitement and agitation.

“Wah, it’s Young Master Gong.”

“Young Master Gong is so handsome, and his figure is so good. He’s even better than a celebrity.”

“What’s most important is that he’s super-rich! He’s the only heir of the Gong family, and the Gong firm will be his alone in the future. Do you know how rich the Gong family is? The salaries of 10 megastars combined won’t even be significant to them.”

“Whoever gets to marry someone as rich and handsome as Young Master Gong must’ve been a saint in their previous lives to accumulate such karma.”

“That might not be true. I heard that Young Master Gong has a bad temper, and he even gets physical with women when he acts up. Also...” One of the women lowered her voice further. “I heard that he almost beat a classmate to death when he was younger. If it wasn’t for his family background and his young age back then, he would’ve been sent to jail already. His classmate ended up as a vegetable and hasn’t regained consciousness since.”

“Are you serious, his temper is that bad?”

“It’s true. A friend was in the same school as him before. He said he practically went mad at that time. The other party was already bleeding so badly, but he wouldn’t let that guy off. If a teacher hadn’t appeared to stop him, he would’ve killed the other person already.

“That friend of mine said that he has a disorder, and he just cannot control his temper when it comes. In any case, he’s alright when he’s in a good mood, but he’s extremely terrifying when provoked. He’s rich and handsome, but wouldn’t you feel scared being with someone who can’t even control his temper? Won’t you be living in constant fear?”
