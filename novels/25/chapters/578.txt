Chapter 579: I Hope That You Won’t Disclose Your Relationship

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“It was never my intention to break you guys up.”

Qiao Mianmian was shocked. She looked up and asked, “You’re willing to accept it?”

Linda smiled. “In all honesty, I’m not that inclined to accept it. But if I don’t accept it, you won’t sign the contract with me. Hence, I’ll have to compromise.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“I’m fine with your relationship. But I need you to make a promise,” Linda suddenly said with a straight face as she sat up.

“What is it?”

“You can continue the relationship, but I hope that you won’t disclose it. You’re essentially a newbie right now. If you were to disclose your relationship before your career takes off, your career will be affected.”

Linda had high expectations for Qiao Mianmian.

She could see the potential in her.

Hence, she really wanted to take Qiao Mianmian under her wing.

If it was another artiste, she would have never compromised.

As it would put her under a lot of risks.

But she couldn’t bear letting go of such a good candidate.

But if Qiao Mianmian wasn’t willing to accept this request, she would have to let her go.

“Fine, I promise,” Qiao Mianmian replied after considering it for a while. “I won’t disclose the relationship.”

They didn’t disclose the relationship until this point, anyway.

Mo Yesi should understand her.

Hence, Qiao Mianmian agreed to it without consulting him first.

Linda smiled and couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief.

Thank goodness Qiao Mianmian agreed to it.

She would be really sad if she lost such a good candidate.

“Since we have cleared up everything, should we sign the contract now?” Linda was an efficient lady, and she immediately fished out a pen.

“Let’s be done with the contract signing so that I can start to arrange your schedule for you.

“I’ve heard that you have agreed to be in a show directed by Bai Yusheng?”

“Yes.” Qiao Mianmian nodded. “I’ll have to be at the set three days later.”

“I’ll have to hire an assistant for you before that, then.” Linda thought for a moment before continuing, “Your portfolio isn’t that strong. I can’t justify getting a huge van to send you around. The best I can do is to get you an assistant.”

Qiao Mianmian had never given a thought about getting driven around in a huge van.

She was aware of her status.

She would have to be a third-class actress to ask for a huge van.

Hence, she wasn’t going to ask for it in the first place.

“Sister Xie, there isn’t a need for an assistant. I...”

Qiao Mianmian changed how she addressed Linda since she was her manager now.

Linda’s last name was Xie. Hence, addressing her as Sister Xie would be the most appropriate.

Linda felt happy.

She felt that Qiao Mianmian was really well-mannered.

The complete opposite of Qiao Anxin...

When she was in Star Splendor, every artiste had to address her as Sister Xie.

Only Qiao Anxin would dare to address her by her name as she was favored by Su Ze. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Anxin was never polite to her.

Linda felt that she must have been really patient, considering how long she tolerated her.

“You must have an assistant,” Linda continued. “Things will be a lot easier if you have one.”
