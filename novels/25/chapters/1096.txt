Chapter 1097: So Rich That He Was Terrified

Now that they were married, they were a family.

Qiao Chen would have to meet the rest of the Mo family sooner or later.

With the Old Madam in the Mo Family, Madam Mo would be more cautious no matter what. Even if she felt uncomfortable, she wouldn’t make it too obvious.

At this thought, Qiao Mianmian felt a little relieved.

Since Mo Yesi was with them, he couldn’t just watch them suffer.

...

An hour later, under Qiao Chen’s stunned expression, Mo Yesi parked the car outside the main building.

Qiao Chen looked at the palace-like white building in front of him and said with a trembling voice, “Sister, Brother-in-law, is this your house?”

Mo Yesi turned off the engine and smiled. “Mm.”

Qiao Chen widened his eyes in shock.

He then asked Qiao Mianmian, “Sister, is this really Brother-in-law’s house?”

Qiao Mianmian knew how he felt.

The first time she followed Mo Yesi back to the Mo residence, she felt the same way.

She was shocked by the size and luxury of the Mo Residence.

“Mm, this is your brother-in-law’s house.” Qiao Mianmian turned to look at him and smiled. “Your brother-in-law is a tycoon, it’s not like you just found out.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Chen was speechless.

Of course, he knew that his brother-in-law was rich.

The first time they met, he gave him a watch worth millions and even gave him a card with more than ten million yuan in savings. He said it was for his pocket money.

Moreover, his brother-in-law’s garage was filled with luxury cars worth at least a few million yuan.

Those cars alone cost him hundreds of millions.

Not only was his brother-in-law rich, but he was also especially rich.

He was a super tycoon.

Hence, Qiao Chen had guessed Mo Yesi’s identity and knew that his brother-in-law’s family background must be very prominent.

However, he still felt that he had underestimated it.

This was the first time Qiao Chen had a clear idea of what a real mansion was like.

Before the Qiao family fell, they were considered rich.

They also lived in a mansion and drove a luxurious car.

But the Qiao family’s so-called mansion was nothing compared to his brother-in-law’s mansion.

His sister hadn’t only married into a rich family.

She had married into a super-wealthy family.

Qiao Chen was super nervous before. Now, he was even more frightened by the mansion in front of him.

He even thought of running away.

God, his brother-in-law was way too rich.

He was so rich that it terrified him.

How did his sister know his brother-in-law and even marry him?

He was really curious!

Uncle Zhang was already waiting outside.

Mo Yesi got out of the car first, then waited for Qiao Mianmian to get off. He put his arm around her waist and waited for Qiao Chen to get off as well.

A few seconds later, Qiao Chen came out of the car.

Uncle Zhang had just finished greeting them when he saw Qiao Chen coming down from the back of the car. He was stunned for a moment before quickly reacting.

He smiled and asked, “You must be Second Madam’s younger brother, right? Hello, Mr. Qiao. I’m the butler of the Mo Residence. You can call me Uncle Zhang.”

As Uncle Zhang spoke, he couldn’t help but size Qiao Chen up.

He looked at Qiao Chen, then at Mo Yesi, and thought to himself, Second Madam’s younger brother looks quite similar to Second Young Master.

His eyebrows and nose were quite similar.

On the other hand, Second Madam looked nothing like her brother.

Although the siblings looked extremely outstanding, their facial features did not resemble each other much.
