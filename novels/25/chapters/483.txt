Chapter 484: She Really... Despised Him

It wasn’t a pleasant experience.

She was feeling a little resistant and afraid of it right now.

She didn’t want Mo Yesi to get her to do it again.

She heard that the first time with a man was always very quick. But the second and third times wouldn’t be as quick anymore.

Although she didn’t know if it was true, she didn’t want to try it out right now.

“I can go on my own.” In order to prove it, she wrapped herself in the blanket, hopped off the bed, and hurried for the toilet.

Seeing how she could still dart to the toilet so energetically, Mo Yesi’s expression changed again. His facial muscles tensed up even more. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

His body stiffened too.

She was still so full of energy.

It seemed like he had really performed terribly.

Although she didn’t say it directly, her question “You’re done?” said it all.

She really... despised him.

Mo Yesi felt heavy-hearted.

Even the challenges he faced at work never made him feel this way.

He silently watched as Qiao Mianmian entered the bathroom and locked the door as if he was a thief. He felt even worse now.

Was she unwilling to shower with him because she despised him?

The man’s expression was way darker than usual. His lips were pursed, his fists were clenched, and he looked in the direction of the bathroom for a few minutes. Then, he turned around and walked out of the bedroom with footsteps as heavy as his heart.

...

When Qiao Mianmian emerged from the bathroom, Mo Yesi was no longer in the bedroom.

She called out to him a few times, but there was no response.

She wrapped a towel around herself and went to get changed, before heading down to ask Lei En about it. Lei En said he hadn’t seen Mo Yesi come downstairs.

“He didn’t come downstairs?” Qiao Mianmian seemed shocked.

She thought Mo Yesi had come down for breakfast.

Lei En shook his head. “Young Master hasn’t come down yet. Young Madam, you didn’t see him? Is the Young Master in the study settling some work?”

“Mm, that’s possible.”

Qiao Mianmian knew that he was usually productive, and it wasn’t surprising to find him at work in the study.

She thought for a bit and then smiled at Lei En. “Get the kitchen to serve breakfast first and then call him down to eat. It’s not early anymore. He has to have his breakfast, however busy he is.”

“Alright, Young Madam.”

Lei En called a housemaid over and got her to inform the kitchen to get breakfast prepared.

He then went upstairs to get Mo Yesi.

...

10 minutes later.

Qiao Mianmian was sitting at the dining table, enjoying the sumptuous breakfast.

Lei En walked towards her and said politely, “Young Madam, Young Master asks you to eat first. He said he still has some things to settle and will come down in a while.”

“He’s that busy?” Qiao Mianmian furrowed her brows a little. “Bring him a cup of milk, then. He should at least have that.”

Qiao Mianmian did not overthink it.

She thought that Mo Yesi was genuinely busy and didn’t have the time to come down for breakfast.

“Yes, Young Madam.”

Lei En glanced at her a little oddly before leaving.

Given the way Young Madam was acting, it didn’t seem like she quarreled with Young Master.

Then, why was Young Master looking so serious and glum when he went to get him just now?

It was as if someone had offended him.

Moreover, he usually made it a point to have breakfast with Young Madam, no matter how busy he was.
