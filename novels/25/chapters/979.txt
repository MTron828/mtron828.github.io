Chapter 981: Don’t Talk to Me From Now On

Qiao Mianmian glared at him. “Is this a question of how many times I have to pay? Do you know how rough you were just now? You... you hurt me.”

Mo Yesi was too much!

He looked like an impatient pervert.

He hadn’t touched her for two days, but he acted as if he hadn’t touched her for 20 years.

Clothed, he looked cold and elegant.

But after taking them off...

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but blush at the thought of their intense interaction.

Mo Yesi was a beast in human clothing!

He bullied her in his office in broad daylight... Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Beast!

And a beast that only knew how to bully her.

It wasn’t too long this time, just an hour...

But in this one hour, he used all his shameless ways to torment her.

Qiao Mianmian’s legs were weak and trembling uncontrollably even now.

She was speechless as she looked at the man who seemed even more energetic after the incident.

Was this man a fox spirit!

Otherwise, why was he always so energetic when she was so tired after doing it?

It was as if he sucked her essence.

The more she thought about it, the more she felt that it was possible.

Mo Yesi’s face matched that of a fox spirit.

The legendary fox spirits were all handsome men.

Moreover, although this man looked very cold in front of others, in front of her...

He really looked like a seductive fox spirit.

Mo Yesi apologized sincerely. “I’m sorry, Baby. I’ll try to be gentler next time.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She couldn’t possibly do it again. Hmph!

“I couldn’t control myself because I haven’t touched you for too long.” The man seriously reflected on his mistake. “I’ll take note next time and won’t hurt you anymore.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

A man’s mouth was a liar.

Mo Yesi wasn’t trustworthy at all.

Especially when it came to such matters. He’d never done anything he’d promised her.

For example, he’d only touched her once, but in the end...

She would never trust him again.

“Baby, where does it hurt? I’ll rub it for you.”

Mo Yesi saw that she still had a straight face and was obviously not forgiving him. He immediately coaxed her gently. “I’ll rub it for you, it won’t hurt so much then.”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t dare to let him do it.

That position...

She was afraid that the beast would get her again...

“Alright, alright, you don’t have to bother about me anymore. Go on with your work.” Qiao Mianmian wrapped the blanket around herself and turned her back to him. “I’m tired, I want to sleep for a while. From now on, don’t talk to me anymore.”

Mo Yesi was speechless.

This little thing was always against him.

He was already used to it.

And he knew that he was indeed a beast after what happened.

He wanted to control himself every time, but the moment he touched her, he couldn’t.

At that time, all rationality was gone.

He just wanted to... bully her.

Especially when she cried, the thought of bullying her intensified.

He felt that he was rather perverted.

Of course, he wouldn’t tell Qiao Mianmian about this.
