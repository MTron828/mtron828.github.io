Chapter 1128: She Hates This Slut to Death

She was secretly overjoyed.

Qiao Mianmian would definitely suffer once Eldest Miss Shen made her move.

No matter how Shen Rou would deal with her, as long as she could make that little b*tch suffer, she would be happy.

If she was down on her luck now, how could she feel at ease when that little b*tch was doing so well?

“Miss Shen, I heard that you and Young Master Gong have been good friends since you were young. You must remind Young Master Gong not to fall for my sister’s tricks. My sister is a scheming person. Many men have fallen for her tricks.”

After hearing her words, Shen Rou sneered with a dark face. “Your sister is indeed very scheming and capable.”

The man she loved the most, the man she loved deeply, had been snatched away by Qiao Mianmian.

It was all because Qiao Mianmian was scheming and capable!

She had never hated anyone since she was young.

But now she did. She hated Qiao Mianmian, hated this b*tch for stealing what she cared about the most.

The people around her were all taken away by that b*tch.

First Mo Yesi, then Gong Zeli...

Among the four of them, Yan Shaoqing was the only one left. But, he was also biased towards that b*tch.

The men she’d grown up with were all around the bitch.

She could no longer enjoy the same treatment as before.

In the past, she was the most favored one.

She was the only girl in the group of four, so she had received more care since she was young.

Whether it was Gong Zeli, Yan Shaoqing, or even Mo Yesi, who had always been lukewarm, they all treated her differently.

She had been taken care of and pampered for so many years.

But now, someone had stolen what originally belonged to her.

Not only had Qiao Mianmian stolen the man she liked, but she had also stolen Gong Zeli, who had always been by her side.

She hated this bitch.

“She has always been a scheming person since she was young.” Qiao Anxin saw that Shen Rou’s expression was getting uglier and uglier and added fuel to the fire. “Actually, you can’t blame Young Master Gong for falling for her tricks. All the men she likes are charmed by her.

“I’m just worried that Young Master Gong won’t be able to see her true colors and will be deceived by her. So, I hope Miss Shen can remind Young Master Gong. With your friendship with him, he will definitely listen to you.”

When Shen Rou thought about her current relationship with Gong Zeli, her expression turned even uglier.

Qiao Mianmian had stolen the two men she cared about the most.

She would never let that b*tch off.

“Miss Qiao, after hearing what you’ve said, you seem to have a lot of opinions about your sister.” Shen Rou didn’t forget the main reason why she wanted to meet Qiao Anxin. She smiled and looked at her. “Did Miss Qiao and your sister have a bad relationship from a young age? Or is it because of that man surnamed Su?”

Qiao Anxin’s expression turned cold at the mention of Su Ze. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

She knew that Su Ze was not a good man when she successfully seduced him.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t have slept with her.

However, she did not expect that he was far worse than she had imagined.

The outside world thought that she and Starlight had proposed the termination of the contract.

But in reality, that scumbag Su Ze forced her to terminate her contract with Starlight.

That scumbag wanted Qiao Mianmian back, so he forced her to break up and leave Starlight.
