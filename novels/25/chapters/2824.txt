Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

He caught up to Qiao Mianmian and stopped her. “Beauty, don’t go. What are you afraid of? I’m not a bad person. Don’t be so cold. Let’s be friends. Tell me what you like, jewelry or luxury cars?”

The drunkard looked at Qiao Mianmian from head to toe and reached out to touch her face. “Look at you, you’re so tender. Let me dote on you.

“As long as you serve me well, I’ll buy you anything you want.”

The man was very drunk. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

He had never considered Qiao Mianmian’s identity.

Qiao Mianmian suppressed her disgust and pushed him away.

The man was already so drunk that he couldn’t stand properly. After being pushed by her, he staggered two steps back and fell heavily onto the ground in a “hungry dog pouncing on shit” posture.

The man cried out in pain the moment he hit the ground.

Enraged, he looked up and glared at Qiao Mianmian. “B*tch, you’re shameless. I’ll teach you a lesson now.”

The man got up from the ground and walked towards Qiao Mianmian with his fists clenched.

He couldn’t stop cursing. “B*tch, do you know who I am? I’m giving you some face, but you really think too highly of yourself. I’ve seen too many women like you. Why are you pretending to be virtuous? Isn’t it just so you can play with just a little more money?”

Seeing the man walking over while cursing, Qiao Mianmian’s expression changed. She quickly thought about whether she could beat this drunk man and was about to run.

A drunk man could do anything when he was drunk.

She didn’t want to take the risk.

She couldn’t beat this man, but she could definitely escape.

Given how drunk he was, he definitely wouldn’t be able to catch up to her.

Qiao Mianmian made up her mind and was about to run when she heard footsteps behind her. A slender black figure walked past her. Before Qiao Mianmian could see who it was, she saw the black figure walk towards the drunk man.

The next moment, the drunkard wailed.

He was kicked to the ground.

The man in black had one foot on his chest. Just as he was about to get up, he kicked him again.

The drunkard screamed even louder.

“Who are you, you… you dare to treat me like this, I’m going to kill you!” He screamed as he reached out to pry the man’s foot off. But before his hand could reach the man’s pants, he was kicked several times.

In the end, he couldn’t even speak.

He was panted.

But he seemed to be cursing.

“Throw him out.” The man in black kicked him one last time and knocked him out. He then turned around and ordered his subordinates.

“Yes, Young Master Gong.”

Two bodyguards went forward and picked the drunkard up from the ground. They then carried him away quickly.

“Are you alright? Did I scare you? You wouldn’t have received this shock if I had come earlier..” Gong Zeli slowly walked towards Qiao Mianmian and saw that she was staring at him.
