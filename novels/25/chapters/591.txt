Chapter 592: A Strong Sense of Fear Descended Upon Him

Mo Yesi started kissing Qiao Mianmian again the moment the door closed.

But what he kissed was the back of her hand instead.

He frowned.

Qiao Mianmian glared at him as she pushed his face away and then asked, “Aren’t you curious about what I got for you?”

Mo Yesi looked down on her slightly-swollen lips. As he looked at them, he wanted to tell her how he really felt. He was more curious about the taste of her lips compared to what she got for him.

“Yes, what did you get for me?”

However, Mo Yesi wasn’t really sincere with his question. He suppressed his rising lust and accommodated her.

Qiao Mianmian dragged him to the coffee table. She then took out a shirt and tie from one of the bags.

“Yes.” Qiao Mianmian looked at Mo Yesi in anticipation of his reaction and said, “Wei Zheng has the same build as you. I’ve asked him to help with the sizing. It should be just right for you. You should try it on. If it’s not the right size, I’ll exchange it for the right one.”

Mo Yesi looked down at the gifts.

Qiao Mianmian had bought him a black shirt and tie.

After he received the gifts, he wasn’t concerned with them. As he removed them from the wrappers, he pretended to be casual and asked, “Do you really feel that we have the same build?”

“That’s right.” Qiao Mianmian didn’t notice the change in his tone and answered, “Both of you are just as slim. He’s a bit shorter than you, but this size is made for men within your height range.”

Mo Yesi nodded as he tried to maintain his composure.

He unpacked the shirt. As he traced his slender fingers across the dark buttons, he asked casually again, “You seem to have a good relationship with Wei Zheng?”

Even at this moment, Qiao Mianmian couldn’t tell that something was amiss.

She nodded and answered honestly, “We have quite a good relationship. Wei Zheng is a pretty nice and patient guy. He didn’t complain despite the long shopping trip. He gave me good suggestions too. He’s a great guy!”

Mo Yesi could no longer maintain his composure.

As he heard the last statement. “He’s a great guy!” His eyes turned cold and he scoffed.

It was time for Wei Zheng to go overseas for some suffering.

Outside the office.

Wei Zheng was returning to his position, unrecovered from the shock just now. Suddenly, he felt an itch on his nose and started sneezing.

He could also feel a strong chill crawling up his spine, giving him goosebumps.

He felt as though a strong sense of fear descended upon him.

His premonition kept getting stronger.

Why did he feel that he was about to be sent overseas?

Could it be an illusion due to the shock just now?

In the office. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Mo Yesi had decided on the date to send Wei Zheng overseas to suffer. Suddenly, a soft pair of arms wrapped around his neck.

He froze for a while. When he looked down, Qiao Mianmian was staring at him lovingly. She then whispered, “Mo Yesi, I don’t think you should try on the shirt. I feel that the sizing doesn’t fit you at all.”
