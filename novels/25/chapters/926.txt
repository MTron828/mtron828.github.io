Chapter 927: Don’t Go to the Hospital

Qiao Mianmian knew that Linda must be looking for her.

She exited WeChat and called her.

“Sister Xie, why are you looking for me?” Qiao Mianmian asked directly.

“Mm, I already know that Huang Yilin brought sulfuric acid to the set. How is Tu Yilei now? Is the burn on the back of his hand serious?”

Qiao Mianmian guessed that she was asking about this, so she told her everything about Tu Yilei.

Linda heaved a sigh of relief. “Thankfully, it’s not too serious. Otherwise...”

Halfway through her sentence, she kept quiet for a few seconds before saying, “I always thought that the scandal between you and Tu Yilei was created by someone with bad intentions, but it seems like he really has that kind of intention towards you.

“Mianmian, what do you think?”

“What do I think?” Qiao Mianmian felt that Linda’s question was a little strange. “I don’t have any thoughts. Sister Xie, you know that I have a boyfriend, and we have a good relationship.”

“Mm, I know.” Linda kept quiet for a while before saying, “Mianmian, since you don’t have any feelings for him, then keep a distance from him. I think you already know the consequences of being too close to him.

“Moreover, he was injured because of you. It’s fine if his fans don’t know about it, but once they do, you’ll be attacked by them. I heard that you took care of him for a long time at the hospital today?”

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian didn’t hide anything. “Sister Xie, I know what you’re saying. It’s just that he got injured because of me, so I can’t sit back and do nothing. It’s my duty to take care of him at the hospital.”

“I didn’t say that you can’t. It’s just that a lot of people go in and out of the hospital. What if someone takes a picture of you? The wound on the back of his hand won’t heal anytime soon. You can’t possibly go to the hospital every day, right?

“And with his situation, I’m afraid the male lead is going to change. This matter can be kept under wraps for a while, but it can’t be kept under wraps forever. When the time comes, his fans will definitely create a scene. Mianmian, I suggest you take the opportunity to keep a distance from him. This isn’t the only way you can repay him.

“Moreover, he has feelings for you. If you go to the hospital every day, he’ll misunderstand. Listen to me, just get someone to go to the hospital for you every day. If you really feel bad, you can call him to show concern.

“But don’t go to the hospital.”

Qiao Mianmian was silent for a long time.

She knew what Linda was worried about.

She had considered all the things Linda had considered.

She also thought that the burn on Tu Yilei’s hand couldn’t be healed in a day or two.

It would take a long time for it to recover.

And in this period of time, he had to reject a lot of work. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Given his current status, he would definitely be working until the Lunar New Year.

But it was precisely because he helped her that his work was affected.

The silence during the peak period had a huge impact on his career.

She felt even more guilty and uneasy.

Because she suddenly realized that Tu Yilei didn’t just cause harm to his body.

It had a huge impact on his career too.
