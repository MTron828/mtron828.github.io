Chapter 873: I’m Willing

“Why, are you unhappy that I’m here to see you?”

“I’m happy. But you’re so tired, my heart aches.” Qiao Mianmian got up from the bed and reached out to touch his eyes. “You can’t even rest well like this. Let’s just meet on the weekends in the future.”

Back in Yuncheng City, they didn’t meet so often.

She didn’t know why this man would fly over to look for her every day when she was in F City.

Was he worried about her being here alone?

“It’s tiring and troublesome for you to run around every day, and it’ll affect your work. I think it’s good that we meet once a week.”

Mo Yesi furrowed his brows. “But I don’t feel tired, and I don’t find it troublesome. Did I affect you by coming over so often?”

Qiao Mianmian really felt bad for him, but Mo Yesi felt that she despised him.

She replied, “... No.”

“Then, you don’t have to worry about me.” Mo Yesi stroked her head and said gently, “I really don’t feel tired. Even if I do, it’s a blissful burden to me. In any case, I’m willing to do everything, so you don’t have to care about what I do.

“Alright, go back to sleep. It’s still early, you can sleep for another two hours.”

Qiao Mianmian had no choice but to give up.

Forget it. Since this man was willing to run and torment her, she’d let him be.

She could tell that if she continued trying to persuade him, he might have other ideas. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

He felt that there must be another reason for her to stop him.

After all, he was a jealous lover.

...

After Mo Yesi left, Qiao Mianmian quickly fell asleep again.

She only woke up when the alarm rang.

After washing up, she heard the doorbell ring.

When she opened the door, she saw that it was the hotel waiter bringing breakfast.

She took it and returned to her room. She opened the bag and saw that Mo Yesi had ordered all sorts of food for her.

There were porridge and side dishes, bread and milk, fruits and desserts.

Qiao Mianmian felt like Mo Yesi was treating her like a pig.

He ordered so many dishes.

But it felt good to have so much good food waiting for her the moment she opened her eyes.

...

After breakfast, Qiao Mianmian reported to the set on time.

When she arrived at the set, she realized that the crew’s attitude towards her had changed.

If they weren’t already polite before, they were now.

She wasn’t surprised.

Perhaps Bai Yusheng’s words from last night had spread.

Hence, everyone in the crew knew that she was Bai Yusheng’s cousin.

Their attitude towards her as the director’s relative would definitely be better.

When Qiao Mianmian arrived at the set to report, she bumped into Tu Yilei, who had just arrived. Even if Qiao Mianmian wanted to keep a distance from him, she couldn’t ignore him.

She hesitated for a while before taking the initiative to greet him. “Good morning, Senior Tu.”

Tu Yilei frowned slightly when he heard the way she addressed him. He pursed his lips and nodded. “Good morning.”

Qiao Mianmian was about to leave.

“Miss Qiao.” Tu Yilei called her as they walked past.

Qiao Mianmian had no choice but to stop. She asked politely and distantly, “What’s the matter, Senior Tu?”
