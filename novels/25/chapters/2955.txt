Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian sighed. “She was wrong to have done this. What about Dad?”

“Dad wanted to plead for her in the beginning, but he has given up now.”

“Mo Yesi, let me ask you a question. Can you answer me honestly?”

“Mm?” Mo Yesi smiled and looked down at the woman beside him. He rubbed her head. “What do you want to ask me? I’ll never lie to you.”

“Actually, it’s nothing. I’m just curious. Do you not mind Dad’s concern for Tang Ya?”

It was obvious that Mo Yunchen had feelings for both Tang Ya and Tang Wangiu.

If he hadn’t married Madam Mo back then, he would have married Tang Wanqiu.

When he left, it wasn’t because he had no feelings for her anymore. It was because of his responsibility.

He had to be responsible for Madam Mo.

He had to be responsible for the Mo family.

In the face of too many responsibilities, relationships could be put aside.

Even Qiao Mianmian could tell that Mo Yunchen still cared about Tang Wangqiu.

She felt that Mo Yesi could tell, but he didn’t seem to care much about it.

“Is that what you wanted to ask?”

“Mm, can you answer? If not, just pretend I didn’t ask.”

“There’s nothing I can’t answer. You asked if I mind, but I don’t.”

“You don’t mind? Why?” After all, anyone else would mind this.

She would mind if her father had another woman in his heart other than her mother.

Moreover, she suddenly had a half-sister.

Qiao Mianmian thought about it. If this happened to her, she wouldn’t be able to completely ignore it.

It was because of Mother Qiao’s death that Father Qiao married Lin Huizhen. Qiao Mianmian was a little upset about it.

“What’s there to mind?” Mo Yesi smiled and said patiently, “Tang Wangiu has already passed away. Even if Dad still has her in his heart, he can’t do anything else. Moreover, Tang Wangiu is different from those third parties who destroy other people’s families. When she met Dad, she didn’t know that he

already had a family.

“Strictly speaking, Dad lied to her and let her down.

“Dad was with her because he liked her. Back then, he left not because he didn’t like her anymore, but because he had to. He liked Tang Wangiu, and she saved his life. She didn’t pester him when he chose to leave. Now, he knows that Tang Wangiu gave birth to a daughter for him.

“He already felt guilty about leaving Tang Wangiu. Now that Tang Ya is like this, he’ll only feel even more sorry for her. He’ll never forget her in this lifetime.”

At this point, Mo Yesi looked at Qiao Mianmian with his deep eyes. “Perhaps I didn’t understand his feelings in the past, but now, I think I do.”

His eyes were focused and affectionate. Qiao Mianmian’s heart raced. “Why is it understandable now?”

“Because I have a woman I love deeply, and I know how it feels to love someone.” Mo Yesi’s eyes were deep, and his dark eyes were filled with her shadow. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Qiao Mianmian’s heart raced.

She was clearly asking about Mo Yunchen, but how did it become Mo Yesi confessing to her?
