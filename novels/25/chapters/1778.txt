Chapter 1779: If You Want to Talk, Please Find Another Place

Otherwise, if this scene was broadcasted, it wouldn’t be exciting.

Song Ke wasn’t as brainless as the cameraman thought. She was so fearless because she saw that the camera wasn’t on.

Of course, she wasn’t a smart person.

If she was, she would know that if a newbie like Qiao Mianmian could be on this show, her background wasn’t something she could offend.

“Really?” Little Xiao didn’t dare to offend Qiao Mianmian openly, so she couldn’t directly agree. She twitched her nose and pretended to smell it. After a few seconds, she smiled and said, “I’ve caught a cold these few days. My nose isn’t very sharp, I didn’t smell it.”

“It’s a good thing you can’t smell it.” Song Ke didn’t know that Little Xiao didn’t dare to offend Qiao Mianmian, so she continued mocking her. “This smell is so pungent, it’s better not to smell it.”

Qiao Mianmian was about to rebut them when Zhan Bo, who claimed he was going to sleep, suddenly opened his eyes and said impatiently, “If you want to talk, please go somewhere else. I’m really tired, can I sleep for a while?”

He sounded rather polite.

But his impatient tone and angry expression showed that he wasn’t in a good mood.

Song Ke was deliberately trying to please him, but Zhan Bo rejected her.

She was already embarrassed.

When she saw the look of disdain and impatience on his face, her expression stiffened. She felt even more shocked.

This was the first time she was despised by the opposite sex.

And he was a male artiste she wanted to hook up with.

Of course, whether she was angry or not, she didn’t blame Zhan Bo.

She blamed everything on Qiao Mianmian.

If it wasn’t for Qiao Mianmian, this vixen, seducing Zhan Bo, he wouldn’t treat her like this.

She couldn’t help but feel even more jealous of Qiao Mianmian.

Little Xiao and Song Ke were a little embarrassed by Zhan Bo. Of course, they were too embarrassed to stand beside him.

“I’m sorry, Senior. We disturbed your sleep.” Little Xiao apologized to him apologetically.

Zhan Bo waved his hand. “Just keep quiet.”

With that, he covered his face with the black hat.

Song Ke’s face was pale as she was pulled back by Little Xiao. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

After she and Little Xiao sat down, she couldn’t help but whisper through clenched teeth, “Little Xiao, did you see that? Zhan Bo is helping her, right? She’s really amazing. She just arrived, and Zhan Bo is already so obsessed.”

Although Song Ke said that, she felt that the woman who could make Zhan Bo so obsessed should be her.

Not Qiao Mianmian.

“Yes.” Little Xiao sighed and lowered her voice. “The endorsement that MC negotiated with me back then was snatched away by her. How can she not be impressive?”

“Your endorsement?” Song Qiao knew about this. She scoffed and said with disdain, “Everyone knows that she got that endorsement because she seduced Young Master Gong.”
