Chapter 495: In the Future, Don’t Talk About How Good Other Men Are in Front of Me

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The air around the man got even colder.

He suddenly grabbed Qiao Mianmian’s hand and pulled her into a hug. The look in his eyes was domineering.

He held her very tight and immediately bit her lip. “In the future, don’t talk about how good other men are in front of me.

“They’re nobody to you, how well do you know them? They’re so good in your eyes? Why don’t you spend more time noticing your husband, I’m not any worse than them.

“If you spend more time with me, you’ll realize that your husband is better than any of them.”

“Uhm.”

Qiao Mianmian looked up at him, his lips still pressed against hers.

She suddenly laughed.

Mo Yesi took a deep breath as he watched this heartless little thing. “What’s so funny?”

He was feeling miserable, and she was happy about it?

Heartless.

“Mo Yesi, you’re jealous?” Qiao Mianmian smiled. “You’re unhappy because I complimented someone else and not you?”

No wonder his mood shifted so quickly. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

She hadn’t thought of this.

Whoever said that women were hard to read was wrong.

A man like Mo Yesi, who was so full of jealousy, was equally hard to read.

The man kept quiet.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

He really was jealous.

She looked at the man whose brows were knitted together and whose eyes seemed to say “I’m so good, why don’t you ever compliment me”. At that moment, the cold and distant man suddenly looked like a puppy asking for compliments.

No, not a puppy, a big dog.

He looked like a mild-tempered loyal German shepherd.

One who would be loyal to his master for a lifetime.

Now that he was upset, she had to coax him properly.

Qiao Mianmian knew how best to coax him. She smiled and reached out to wrap her arms around his neck, then pulled him low and close and planted a kiss on his lips.

“Alright, don’t be angry. Of course, I know that you’re outstanding. You’re the youngest, most capable Chairman in the Mo Corporation’s history, and you’ve managed to handle such a big company so well. You wouldn’t be able to do this if you weren’t outstanding.

“Although I don’t know much about business and company stuff, I know how hard it is to manage even a small group of people. It was hard enough when I was a class monitor in the past. There are so many people in the Mo Corporation, it’s absurdly hard to even think of managing them well.

“So, I really think that you’re very, very amazing! The best ever! You’re my idol!”

Since he minded the fact that she complimented other men in front of him...

It’d be good for her to praise him like this now.

Hopefully, he wouldn’t be so upset about it after this.

After Qiao Mianmian was done, she looked up at his face.

As she guessed, his expression was a lot softer now.

The air around him wasn’t so cold anymore too.

His eyes were fixated on her face. “I’m your idol?”

Qiao Mianmian saw how useful this was and quickly nodded. “Yup, yup. You’re my idol. I look up to you sooo much!”
