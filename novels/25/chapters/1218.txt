Chapter 1221: Can You Satisfy Aunty’s Wish?

“Auntie, you’re too polite. I didn’t do anything. If I said anything to make you unhappy, I hope you won’t take it to heart.”

“Of course not. Aiya, you must be hungry after talking for so long.” Madam Bai held Qiao Mianmian’s hand and said affectionately, “Quickly tell Auntie what you want to eat.”

“But, Auntie...”

“Just treat it as fulfilling a wish of mine, okay? I’ve always wanted to cook a meal for my daughter, but...” As Madam Bai spoke, her eyes turned red.

“Auntie, don’t be sad. If possible, cook me a bowl of noodles.”

Qiao Mianmian was embarrassed to let Madam Bai cook for her.

However, when she heard Madam Bai say that she wanted to make a meal for her daughter, she suddenly felt a little sad and quickly nodded in agreement.

“Noodles? Just a bowl of noodles?”

“Yes, I just want to eat some noodles now.” Actually, she didn’t want to trouble Madam Bai too much.

“Okay, wait here. I’ll make it for you right away.”

Madam Bai turned around and happily went to cook noodles for her.

Qiao Mianmian originally thought that a pampered and wealthy lady like Madam Bai wouldn’t be able to cook. She thought that as long as Madam Bai could cook noodles, it would be considered good.

Unexpectedly, after ten minutes, Madam Bai actually made a bowl of seafood noodles that looked quite good.

The nutrition and color of the noodles were very good. It looked very appetizing.

“Mianmian, the noodles are ready. Try it and see how it tastes. I haven’t cooked in a while, and I don’t know if my cooking skills have deteriorated. I can’t guarantee anything else, but I can still cook a bowl of noodles.”

Madam Bai placed the cooked noodles on the dining table and watched Qiao Mianmian pick up her chopsticks with anticipation.

Under her expectant gaze, Qiao Mianmian slowly took a bite of the noodles.

“How is it? Is it delicious?” Madam Bai immediately asked.

“Mm, delicious.” Qiao Mianmian took another bite.

She was really surprised. She didn’t expect that not only did Madam Bai could cook, but she also cooked so well.

Her craftsmanship was definitely not bad.

It could even be considered very good.

This bowl of seafood noodles was even better than what she ate outside.

“Is it really delicious?” Madam Bai’s eyes lit up. Now that her culinary skills had been confirmed, she felt much happier.

“Yes, really delicious,” Qiao Mianmian said honestly. “It’s even better than many seafood noodles I’ve eaten in the past. Auntie, I didn’t expect your culinary skills to be so good. Did Auntie especially learn it?”

Madam Bai saw that she was not being polite and became even happier. Her eyes curved as she smiled and said, “Yes, I did. I learned it for your uncle when I was young. You know, it’s said that if you want to capture a man’s heart, you have to first grab his stomach. That’s why I learned all the dishes your uncle likes.

“Later on, I fell in love with cooking. Now and then, I would cook by myself, but because your uncle is still working overseas, he rarely comes back, so I rarely cook.”

Madam Bai added, “Eat it while it’s hot. The seafood noodles will turn fishy when cold. It won’t taste good anymore.”

Qiao Mianmian nodded and focused on eating.

Madam Bai sat beside her and watched as she ate the noodles. She felt extremely satisfied.
