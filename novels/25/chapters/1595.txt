Chapter 1596: I Want to Teach That Bitch a Good Lesson

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

If it wasn’t for the benefits, Qiao Anxin wouldn’t care about Boss Huang’s life.

She had no choice but to give herself to Boss Huang for her future.

But deep down, she was disgusted by him.

But no matter how disgusting it was, she had to do it on the surface.

Everyone else in the company had gone to visit, so of course, she also had to.

...

Before Qiao Anxin went, she already knew that Boss Huang was beaten up badly.

But when she saw how swollen his face was, she was still shocked.

She turned around and looked at Song Fang in fear.

Song Fang was shocked too. She didn’t expect Boss Huang to be beaten up so badly.

It seemed like the Young Master of the Gong Family was really ruthless.

After seeing Boss Huang, they understood why people said that they would rather offend the King of Hell than the Young Master of the Gong Family.

Because offending the Young Master of the Gong Family might cause you to meet the King of Hell!

Boss Huang woke up. He was probably still in pain and kept screaming. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

His eyes were small.

After being hit, his eyes became swollen and only a slit was left.

His face was swollen, and his facial features seemed to have sunk into his flesh.

Qiao Anxin was disgusted, but she suppressed it and walked over to him. “Chairman Huang, it’s Anxin. I’m here to see you. How do you feel now?”

Boss Huang looked up at her.

Qiao Anxin sat down on the bed and picked up a glass of water from the bedside table. She asked gently, “Chairman Huang, do you want some water? I’ll feed you.”

Boss Huang shook his head.

Qiao Anxin asked again, “Do you have anything you want to eat? I’ll get someone to get it for you.”

Boss Huang still shook his head.

Qiao Anxin frowned. Just as she was thinking about what to say next, Boss Huang suddenly reached out and grabbed her hand.

Qiao Anxin was shocked. “Chairman Huang...”

“Y-Your sister...” Boss Huang couldn’t even speak properly. “Why didn’t you tell me she’s related to Gong Zeli?

“Is, is she Gong Zeli’s woman?”

Qiao Anxin was stunned and wanted to retract her hand, but Boss Huang grabbed it tightly.

She wondered where Boss Huang got his strength from.

He looked half-dead, but his grip on Qiao Anxin’s hand was especially strong.

“That, that slut!” Boss Huang clenched his teeth and said fiercely, “It’s all because of her. I-I’m so unlucky. I-I won’t let that slut off.”

Qiao Anxin’s eyes lit up.

“You’re her sister. Y-You have to find a way to ask that slut out.” Boss Huang’s expression was ferocious. “I want to teach that slut a lesson.

“If you settle this for me, you’ll be the company’s top star in the future. I’ll give you all the company’s resources.”

Qiao Anxin’s eyes lit up.

“Chairman Huang, is what you said true?”

If she became the company’s top star in the future, she wouldn’t have to worry about resources anymore.

More importantly, she couldn’t do anything to Qiao Mianmian.

If someone wanted to deal with Qiao Mianmian, she would definitely support it.

Qiao Anxin understood Boss Huang.

If Qiao Mianmian landed in his hands...

A trace of viciousness and satisfaction flashed past Qiao Anxin’s eyes. She couldn’t wait to see that day.
