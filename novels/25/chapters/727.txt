Chapter 728: I’m Worried, I’ll Go Look at Her

Bai Yusheng said lazily, “Didn’t I tell you that she was safely delivered?”

“But I can’t get in touch with her.” Mo Yesi took a deep breath. “I sent her a WeChat message, but she didn’t reply. I called her just now, but she didn’t pick up. I’m worried that something happened to her.

“You left after sending her to the hotel? You didn’t send her up?”

“You didn’t ask me to send her up,” Bai Yusheng said casually. “What’s there to worry about? I saw her enter the elevator, and the hotel’s security is pretty good. Don’t worry.”

“Don’t worry?” Mo Yesi was already worried, to begin with, and he almost exploded when he heard this. “I can’t even contact her now, and you’re telling me not to worry? Do you know how worried I am?”

“I don’t know...”

“Bai Yusheng.” Mo Yesi clenched his teeth.

Bai Yusheng said innocently, “I really don’t know. I’ve never been in a relationship, how would I know what you guys think? Since you’re worried about her, why don’t you come over and see for yourself if she’s safe?”

“I’m going over.”

Mo Yesi looked at the falling numbers and wondered why the elevator was going so slowly today.

Why wasn’t it negative!

He tried his best to remain calm and composed. “I’ll head to the airport right away and take the earliest flight. But it’ll take me three hours to get to City F.”

At this point, he felt a deep sense of helplessness.

No matter how powerful he was, he couldn’t be by her side immediately.

So what if he was anxious?

It wouldn’t change anything.

“I can’t contact her now, and I don’t know how she’s doing. I’m... a little afraid. Bai Yusheng, help me take a look. I have to make sure she’s safe.”

There was silence.

Mo Yesi was getting impatient. “Bai Yusheng, did you hear me? I want you to...”

“Alright, alright. I heard it all.” Bai Yusheng yawned lazily. “I’ll let you see it right away, alright. If you ask me, she might be taking a shower, or she might be too tired after going back and fell asleep. How long has it been since you last contacted her, and you’re already in such a hurry? When she called you at first, you were so arrogant and refused to pick up. Now that she’s ignoring you, you’re so anxious. Mo Yesi, what do you think?

“Don’t be so awkward.”

Mo Yesi said coldly, “This is between me and her, it has nothing to do with you. Alright, cut the crap and look for her immediately.”

Ding! He finally reached the car park.

Mo Yesi hung up and walked straight to his car after exiting the elevator.

He drove the car out of the garage and headed straight for the airport.

An hour later, on the plane to F City.

Madam Mo called again.

Mo Yesi picked it up and said before she could say anything, “Mom, I can’t go back today. I’m on the plane right now.”

“What, you’re on the plane?” Madam Mo was shocked. “Where are you going? Didn’t I tell you to come home?”

Mo Yesi kept quiet for a while before turning to look out of the window. “F City. Mianmian is in some trouble. I’m worried. I’ll go over to see her.”
