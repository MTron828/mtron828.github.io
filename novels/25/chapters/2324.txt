Chapter 2325: Hello, Teacher Bai

“So, it’s your teacher.” The man nodded and smiled. “Since it’s your teacher, let’s go over and say hi.”

Gu Sheng hesitated.

“What?” The man smiled. “If it’s inconvenient, then forget it.”

“It’s not inconvenient.” Gu Sheng took a deep breath and didn’t hesitate anymore. “It’s just that my teacher has a strange temper. He likes to scold people. I’m afraid he’ll say something that’ll make you unhappy.”

“It’s alright, it’s just a greeting. We’ll leave after that.”

“Alright, then.”

Gu Sheng nodded and looked up at Bai Yusheng. For some reason, she felt a little guilty.

She hadn’t done anything wrong, but Bai Yusheng’s gaze made Gu Sheng feel otherwise.

Gu Sheng didn’t expect to meet Bai Yusheng here tonight.

She also didn’t expect him to look at her for so long.

If it wasn’t for the man beside her, she wouldn’t have known.

It had been almost a month since the banquet.

She hadn’t seen Bai Yusheng in all this time.

Gu Sheng rarely thought of this person.

She was busy.

After returning to China, she had to prepare for the art exhibition and attend many related meetings and lectures.

She had a fulfilling month.

It was so fulfilling that she didn’t have the time to think about others.

Seeing Bai Yusheng again felt like a year had passed.

She couldn’t understand why he was looking at her like that.

She thought about it but still didn’t know how she made him unhappy.

Although they parted on bad terms at the banquet previously, a whole month had passed since then.

She wasn’t angry with him anymore.

Was he still angry about what happened last time?

This man was too petty.

Given Gu Sheng’s temper, if she was alone now, she would treat him like a stranger and not greet him at all.

But since her companion asked, she couldn’t say that she didn’t know him.

Under Bai Yusheng’s menacing gaze, she walked towards him with the man.

“Teacher Bai.” Gu Sheng smiled, and dimples appeared on her cheeks.

Her tone was full of respect for her teacher.

The man beside her also greeted him. “Hello, Teacher Bai.”

The anger in Bai Yusheng’s heart burned fiercely. The palm-sized fire instantly burned in his eyes, making them red.

He clenched his fists so tightly that his knuckles turned white.

The fire in his eyes was terrifying. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Gu Sheng felt like she was about to be burned and couldn’t help but take a step back.

She felt that Bai Yusheng was very scary right now.

Even scarier than on the night of the banquet when he held her hand and refused to let her go.

Even her companion felt Bai Yusheng’s anger. He frowned and instinctively reached out to shield Gu Sheng.
