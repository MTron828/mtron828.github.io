If it wasn’t for him, her mother might have married a man who doted on her and lived a blissful life, and she would also have a happy family.

‘Mo Yunchen stood at the door and looked at Tang Ya when he heard the voice. When their eyes met, Mo Yunchen’s eyes flashed with surprise.

He sawa pair of familiar eyes.

“You’re Tang Ya,” he said after snapping out of his daze. He quickly scanned the room and asked coldly, “Where’s Yueyue?*

“Mr. Mo, why are you in such a hurry? Why don’t you come in and have a cup of tea? Your granddaughter is in a very safe place now. You don’t have to worry about her safety.”

Mo Yunchen said threateningly, “No need for tea. I’ve already done as you asked. Just tell me, what do you want to give Yueyue to me? Money, or something else?”

Tang Ya laughed. “Money? Mr. Mo, you think I want money?”

Mo Yunchen glared at her. “Whether you want money or something else, the Mo family can do its best to satisfy you. But the premise is that you can’t hurt Yueyue. You have to return her to us unscathed.

“Otherwise, you should know the consequences of offending the Mo family.”

“Is Mr. Mo threatening me?”

“Tm not threatening you. I’m telling you that there are consequences to everything you do.” Mo Yunchen looked at Tang Ya’s familiar eyes again. They reminded him of someone he hadn’t thought of for along time.

But once he thought about them, that person’s voice and smile were still clear in his mind.

Mo Yunchen couldn’t help but ask, “Your name is Tang Ya? Who is Tang Wanqiu to you? Why do I see her in you?” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The moment he asked that the teacup in Tang Ya’s hand fell to the ground.

She looked up with hatred in her eyes.

Mo Yunchen was stunned.

The hatred in her eyes was directed at him.

“Tt wasn’t easy. You’re such an important person, yet you still remember such an ordinary woman like Tang Wanqiu. I thought you’d forgotten about her. After all, didn’t you leave her pretty quickly?

“A woman who saved your life and was in love with you. You didn’t have any feelings for her and left her without looking back. Mo Yunchen, you left so casually, but you ruined her happiness.

“You ruined a woman’s life and made her life a tragedy. But you have a successful career and a happy family. What right do you have to do this!

“Just because you’re from a prestigious family and she’s just an ordinary girl from an ordinary family, she deserves to be ignored by you? Does she deserve to be a plaything that you can abandon whenever you want?”

Mo Yunchen looked at her in shock. “Who exactly are you to Tang Wanqiu? Why do you know so much about her?”

Not many people knew about him and Tang Wangqiu back then.

If she wasnt close to Tang Wangiu, she wouldn’t know so much about this..
