“Your granddaughter is sleeping right now. Someone will send her back when you finish doing what I asked.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Mo Yunchen took the cell phone and looked at the little girl sleeping soundly on the screen. He was finally relieved.

He returned the cell phone to Tang Ya. “I’m the one you hate. Just come at me. The child is innocent. I hope you can do what you say.”

“Hmph. Of course, I’ll do what I say. But you have to do as I say.” Tang Ya took the cell phone and threw the box containing the pill to him. “I wanted you to eat this after your divorce, but I suddenly changed my mind.

“You should take this pill now.”

Mo Yunchen caught the box and looked down at it. He then looked up at Tang Ya and asked calmly, “What medicine is in it?”

“It’s poison, do you dare to eat it?”

Mo Yunchen looked down at the box in his hand and didn’t say anything else. He opened the box and took out the brown pill.

“Don’t worry, it won’t be too painful. After taking this pill, you’ll soon fall asleep. You’ll have a wonderful dream and then your life will end.” Tang Ya’s emotionless voice sounded. “Mo Yunchen, as long as you take this pill now, I’ll get someone to send your granddaughter back immediately.

“Lwon’t hurt anyone in the Mo family in the future.

“Are you willing to exchange your life for your granddaughter’s?”

“So, this pill is going to take my life.” Mo Yunchen smiled and said casually, “Xiao Ya, if my life can be exchanged for Yueyue’s, it can make up for all the years I’ve hurt Wangqiu, and it can make you stop living with hatred. It’s worth it.”

“Then, take this pill now.” Tang Ya didn’t believe that he really dared to take it. She sneered. “Mo Yunchen, do you really dare to take it? Can you bear to part with your current wealth and status, and everything you have in this world?”

“Didn’t you go back because you couldn’t bear to let go of your status as the Young Master of the Mo family?”

Mo Yunchen sighed. Although he knew that Tang Ya didn’t believe him, he still explained, “Xiao Ya, I didn’t go back for my identity, but for my responsibility.”

“For responsibility? Hahaha, your reason is so dignified.”

“Lknow you don’t believe me. No matter what, I did let Wangiu down, and I didn’t do my duty as your father. I let both of you down. My life was saved by Wangiu, so I should be content with living for a few more decades. Now, just treat it as me returning this life.”

Mo Yunchen swallowed the brown pill without hesitation.

“Bam!”

At the same time, the door to Tang Ya’s study was kicked open.

“Dad, you can’t eat it!”

“Dad, you can’t eat it!”

‘Mo Yesi and Mo Shixiu opened the door open and rushed inside, only to see Mo Yunchen swallow the pill.

The duo’s expressions changed drastically.

The moment she saw them break in, Tang Ya’s expression changed. She subconsciously grabbed something and looked at Mo Yesi and Mo Shixiu guardedly.

Before Tang Ya could even see how Mo Yesi got to her, her neck was grabbed by him. The man exuded a cold and murderous aura as his slender fingers tightened around her slender neck inch by inch..
