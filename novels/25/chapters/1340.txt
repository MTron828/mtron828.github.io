Chapter 1341: I Think They’re Trying to Ban You

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Qin Han, have you seen our comments? Answer us. Are you being threatened? Don’t be afraid, we will support you.”

Qin Han replied to one of the fans: “Director Bai and I have known each other for many years, and we are very good friends. We admire each other, so we facilitated this cooperation. No one forced me, and no one could force me. My fans are all very well-mannered and reasonable people. I hope everyone doesn’t hurt the innocent. I rarely praise any newbie, but Qiao Mianmian’s performance really surprised me. It’s a pleasure to act with her. When the show is out, I believe everyone will agree with me.”

Qin Han rarely praised newbies.

He might be pressured to take on this show.

But if he didn’t really admire Qiao Mianmian, he wouldn’t praise her like this.

Most of his fans were well-mannered, and not all of them were his fans.

The fans calmed down after hearing Qin Han’s explanation.

They were so angry because they thought that Qin Han was forced to take on the show.

But now that he’d explained it clearly and they knew that it wasn’t what they thought, they stopped attacking Qiao Mianmian.

But they still had reservations about Qin Han praising her.

Even if Qiao Mianmian wasn’t a pretty face, how good could her acting be?

Qin Han was just being polite.

...

At the Qiao house.

Qiao Anxin received a few calls.

They were all from the brands she’d signed with.

Everyone called her because they wanted to terminate the contract.

Zhao Kai also called her and told her that he had to consider signing with Huan Yu.

But Zhao Kai had already promised her to sign with Huan Yu.

After Qiao Anxin received another call to terminate her contract, she finally felt that something was wrong.

The brands had to pay a huge sum for breaking the contract.

“Miss Qiao, I’m sorry. We’ll compensate you according to the contract.”

Qiao Anxin tightened her grip on her cell phone. “Why do I have to terminate the contract? You have to give me a reason. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Haven’t we always been working well together? We just signed the contract a few days ago, why are we terminating it today?”

“This, Miss Qiao...” Her question seemed to have troubled the other party. The other party was silent for a while before sighing. “Miss Qiao, on account that we’ve been working together for so long, I’ll tell you the truth.

“Actually, we don’t want to terminate the contract with you, but we can’t do anything about it. We don’t dare to offend the Mo Corporation. Someone there said that whoever dares to cooperate with you is going against the Mo Corporation. We’re just a small company, we really don’t dare to offend the Mo Corporation.”

“Mo Corporation?!”

“Yes, Miss Qiao. How did you offend the Mo Corporation? I think they want to ban you.”

Qiao Anxin’s face turned pale.

She had already guessed it.

When she left the Bai family that day, she had been worried about how they would treat her.

Now, her punishment was finally here.

They wanted to ban her.

For an artiste, banning was the worst punishment.

An artiste who was banned might not live as well as an ordinary person.
