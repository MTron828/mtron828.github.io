Chapter 2581: Untitled

Her cell phone suddenly rang.

Qiao Mianmian looked down and saw that it was Linda. She wiped her mouth with a napkin and opened the WeChat page.

Linda sent her a few messages.

Linda: [The Golden Globe Awards has posted the list of nominees on Weibo. Because of this, you’re trending again.]

Linda: [Some of them said that you were shortlisted because of your background.]

Linda: [The company has already made a statement, saying that they want to sue the person who spread this rumor. But the topic of you being nominated using your connections is still ongoing. Do you want to clarify this yourself? Of course, if you don’t think it’s necessary, then forget it. The company can handle it.]

Linda: [I just feel that this nomination is very important to you. You’re shortlisted because of your capability. If you’re influenced by those people, it won’t be good if those people who don’t know the truth think that you were shortlisted because of your connections. So, I suggest you post something on Weibo.]

Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

Her first reaction was shock.

She was trending again?

Was she being led by the haters again?

Couldn’t they let her have a good dinner?

Now that she heard that she was on the trending list, she felt uncomfortable and even instinctively felt afraid because she’d been on the hot searches so many times, and many of those times weren’t because of something good.

Hence, she really didn’t want to be on the hot searches at all. She was afraid.

“What happened?” Mo Yesi didn’t miss the subtle change in her expression. He saw her frown as she put down the cutlery.

“It’s nothing.” Qiao Mianmian bit her lip and said, “Sister Xie said that I’m on the hot searches. She suggested that I reply on Weibo.”

“Mm? You’re trending? What for?”

Mo Yesi’s expression was calm when he heard that Qiao Mianmian was trending again.

It was as if he was used to it.

“It’s about me being nominated for the Best Female Lead Award.”

“Mm, this doesn’t sound like a bad thing. Why are you frowning?” Seeing that her plate was empty, Mo Yesi couldn’t help but cut a few more pieces of steak and put them on her plate.

Ever since he got together with Qiao Mianmian, whenever they ate together, Mo Yesi couldn’t help but “serve” her.

He didn’t find it troublesome.

On the contrary, he enjoyed it. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

He enjoyed the fact that he was willing to “serve” her.

Especially when he saw her eat the food he fed her, he felt very satisfied.

If he could make her fatter, he would feel even more accomplished.

“Because I’m the only newbie who was shortlisted, and I was shortlisted for only one representative work. So, a group of people on Weibo are saying that I was shortlisted because of my connections. Mm, they’re saying I relied on my relationship with the Mo and Bai families to get shortlisted.”

Mo Yesi understood.

He narrowed his eyes and thought for a while before saying in a low voice, “Your development is too smooth now. The situation is too good. It might affect the development of some of your opponents.. Or it might be because of your nomination that some artiste with high hopes of being shortlisted lost their qualification.”
