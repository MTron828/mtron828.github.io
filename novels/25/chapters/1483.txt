Chapter 1486: I Already Have a Woman I Like

Hence, they arranged a date for tonight.

Madam Gong knew her son’s personality, so she coaxed him.

Madam Gong thought that An Ya was an outstanding girl, and Gong Zeli would definitely like her.

But she didn’t know that Gong Zeli already had someone in his heart.

Gong Zeli looked down at the shy and blushing An Ya and kept quiet for a few seconds before saying coldly, “Miss An, I think I’d better get straight to the point, lest you misunderstand me.

“I’m sure you can tell that your family and mine are trying to matchmake us.”

An Ya blushed even more.

She quickly glanced at Gong Zeli and said shyly, “So... Brother Zeli can tell too. I wonder... what Brother Zeli thinks.”

Gong Zeli wasn’t interested in girls like An Ya.

Moreover, he already had someone in his heart.

He didn’t even want to look at her.

He had been with many women, so he could tell that An Ya had feelings for him.

He felt that he should make things clear.

Gong Zeli thought for a while and said directly, “I’m sorry, Miss An. You’re not my type. Moreover, I already have a woman I like. So, I think this matter is over.

“If Miss An is willing, we can be ordinary friends.”

An Ya widened her eyes. “Just... just friends?”

“Mm.” Gong Zeli looked at her coldly. “Of course, if Miss An isn’t willing, then forget it. I still have something on, please stop blocking my way.”

An Ya was stunned. She blushed when she realized that she had indeed blocked Gong Zeli’s way.

Gong Zeli didn’t look at her anymore. He got into the car and left.

He had driven away for a while, but An Ya was still standing there.

She was still thinking about what Gong Zeli had said, and her eyes were red with anger.

At this moment, her cell phone rang. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

An Ya bit her lip and picked it up.

“Baby, how’s your chat with Aunt Gong’s son? Have you eaten? I have two tickets for the concert here. I’ll send them to you later. After dinner, you can go to the concert to promote your relationship.”

“Promote my ass.”

Speaking of which, An Ya wasn’t officially born into a rich family.

Although the An family was rich, they were different from the Gong and Mo families.

The An family became rich in An Ya’s father’s generation.

Although An Ya was from a prestigious family, her upbringing and etiquette weren’t that good.

She vented her anger on Madam An. “Brother Zeli has already left. I’m not with him now. It’s all your rotten idea. You arranged this blind date behind Brother Zeli’s back. He’s very against this because he’s unhappy with me.”

“What? You said your Aunt Gong’s son has left? He knows that our families want to matchmake you two?”

“Brother Zeli is so smart, how could he not know?” An Ya said angrily. “He hates it when people lie to him. He must have a bad impression of me now. It’s all your fault, what should we do now?”
