Chapter 1104: The Old Madam Really Likes Qiao Chen

On the Old Madam’s left was Qiao Mianmian, and on her right was Qiao Chen.

She looked at Qiao Chen lovingly. “Chen Chen just told us a joke. This child is really too funny.”

Mo Yesi glanced at Qiao Chen and pretended to be jealous. “Because of Mianmian, Grandma doesn’t care about me anymore. Now there’s Chen Chen. It seems like my status in this family is getting worse by the day.”

The Old Madam was amused by him. “You child, are you jealous of your wife and brother-in-law? I like Mianmian and Chen Chen, aren’t you happy? But Mianmian and Chen Chen are indeed adorable. Grandma can’t help but dote on them.”

Qiao Chen was very nervous before he came.

He always felt that the elders of big families were definitely not easy to get along with. They were definitely people who were very serious and difficult to get close to.

But Old Madam dismissed his thoughts.

He was just like Qiao Mianmian. If others treated him well, he would treat them well too. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Although they had only interacted for a short period of time, he could feel the Old Madam’s kindness and fondness for them.

This was completely different from Madam Mo’s attitude.

Just like Qiao Mianmian, Qiao Chen said sweetly, “Grandma likes to hear me tell jokes, so I’ll tell you more in the future. As long as you don’t feel sick of it.”

“Sure.”

Qiao Chen sat on the first seat on the right side of the old lady. The old lady reached out and held his hand. Her eyes were gentle and loving as she smiled and said, “Then, in the future, when Chen Chen is free, come over more often to accompany Grandma. In this house, it’s usually just me and your Aunt Mo. It’s quite boring.

“You young people often come back to accompany us when you’re free. We’re happy too.”

“I think Chen Chen can come over and stay with me on the weekends.” As the old lady spoke, she became serious. “Your sister is going overseas to film. Your brother-in-law is usually busy with work, and he can’t take care of you as a man. Come over to me. I’ll help you improve your life.

“And you could spend some time with a boring old woman like me.

“Of course, young people like to play with young people. If you don’t feel like accompanying an old woman like me...”

“How could that be?” Before the old lady could finish, Qiao Chen smiled and said, “If Grandma wants to see Chen Chen, Chen Chen is very willing to accompany Grandma. Chen Chen won’t feel bored at all when he’s with Grandma.”

His words made the old lady even happier. She laughed happily and said, “Chen Chen, this child is sensible and knows how to make people happy. Then, let’s make it clear. In the future, when you’re on holiday, come over and accompany Grandma.”

“Okay.”

Mo Yesi was happy to see his brother-in-law and Old Madam getting along so well.

He could tell that Old Madam really liked Qiao Chen.

The main reason was probably that Qiao Chen looked like his second uncle.

Mo Yesi didn’t notice this at first.

Now that he was paying attention, he realized that Qiao Chen did look like his second uncle.

No one would doubt the similarity between the two.

Mo Yesi looked at Qiao Chen’s face, which bore no resemblance to Qiao Mianmian at all. A strange light flashed in his eyes, and he sized Qiao Chen up again.

“Ah Si, where’s your mother?”
