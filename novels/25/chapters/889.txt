Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian’s expression stiffened. Just as she was about to say something, Tu Yilei spoke first. “Miss Qiao, Michael’s menopause has expired, so his temper is a little abnormal. Just ignore him. I suddenly remember that I still have two scenes to shoot, right? I wonder if Miss Qiao can accompany me for a while?

“I definitely can’t go to the set for the next few days. I’m afraid that if I take too much time, I won’t feel good when I act in the future. So, can I trouble Miss Qiao to come to the hospital to rehearse with me if you have the time?

“Of course. If there’s anything else, just pretend I didn’t say anything.”

“Little brat, what are you talking about? Who’s going through menopause? Also, what’s so good about your acting? Just give me these few days...”

“Michael, shut up.” Tu Yilei turned around and glared at him. “I know what I’m doing. I don’t need you to make a decision for me. If you feel uncomfortable staying here, you can go back.”

Michael was angry and aggrieved at being threatened by his son.

This brat actually dared to scold him for a woman!

Was he disobedient?

He actually said that his menopause had come.

He was still young, not even 40 yet!

But Michael only dared to grumble in his heart. It was precisely because Tu Yilei was an artiste that he managed to make famous. The two of them had been together for many years, so he understood this little brat’s personality.

If he angered him, he wouldn’t admit anything.

He was willing to take the risk of disfiguring himself for Qiao Mianmian. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

It was obvious how important Qiao Mianmian was to him.

He finally understood.

He couldn’t persuade this brat anymore.

This time, his little brat really fell for it.

Michael was furious, but in the end, he could only reply, “If you want me to go back, I’ll go back. If I don’t, I’ll stay here. What can you do to me?!”

How could he leave Tu Yilei here alone?

Although they were managerial and signed artistes, their relationship had long since become friends. In fact, it was even better than that.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Although Michael always seemed unhappy with her, she didn’t feel bad about him.

After all, Michael was a manager, and everything he did was for the good of his artiste.

From Michael’s point of view, he hadn’t done anything wrong.

Qiao Mianmian could tell if he really hated her.

Huang Yilin detested her.

But she didn’t feel the same emotion from Michael.

Bai Yusheng looked at Tu Yilei thoughtfully and then turned to look at Qiao Mianmian.

...

In the end, Qiao Mianmian stayed in the hospital to accompany Tu Yilei.

Actually, they hadn’t been acting for long. Although the wound on Tu Yilei’s hand could be treated, it was sulfuric acid that was splashed on the back of his hand. Even if it was diluted, the wound was still very painful.

He didn’t look too well.

Qiao Mianmian could tell that he was definitely not feeling well.

Hence, after a little more than 10 minutes, Qiao Mianmian decided to leave.

Tu Yilei didn’t want her to leave just like that and said a little anxiously, “What’s wrong? Did I not perform well just now, and you don’t think you have feelings for me?”
