Qiao Mianmian followed Mo Yesi to the car park and got into the car. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Still sad?” Mo Yesi looked at his silent wife and gently pulled her into his arms.

He placed a hand on her head and caressed her gently. “Don’t be sad anymore. Besides them, you have a lot of people to love. There’s me, Chen Chen, and Madam Bai. Don’t be sad for people who aren’t worth it. My heart aches, okay?”

Qiao Mianmian leaned against the man’s firm and warm chest and smelled his familiar scent. Her heart instantly became peaceful.

She still felt like she was dreaming.

The clear heartbeat and the warmth of his palm made her feel real.

She could feel that the man beside her was real.

Mo Yesi really came to F City.

But she remembered that he’d said that he’d be busy for the next two weeks and wouldn’t have the time to visit her.

“Mo Yesi, why are you here?” Qiao Mianmian looked up slowly and touched his handsome face. “Weren’t you at work? Didn’t you say you were busy recently? Why are you here?

“Are you here on a business trip?”

Mo Yesi grabbed her hand and whispered, “I’m not on a business trip. I’m here to look for you.

“I saw the video of Lin Huizhen slandering you online. I wanted to help you settle this, but Bai Yusheng said that you wanted to settle it yourself, so I didn’t interfere. You solved it very well, better than I could think of.

“I just realized that my baby doesn’t need my help for everything. Without me, you can still handle things well.”

Qiao Mianmian felt a little better after hearing his praise.

She smiled and said, “So, are you praising me?”

“Mm.” Mo Yesi also chuckled. Seeing Qiao Mianmian’s smile, his expression relaxed a little. “Hubby is praising you. My baby is so amazing.”

It had to be said that Mo Yesi’s appearance comforted Qiao Mianmian a lot.

When she was in a terrible mood, the person she loved appeared and accompanied her.

Although she still felt a little sad, it was much better than being alone.

She was in a terrible mood just now.

She almost cried.

She didn’t care how Lin Huizhen and Qiao Anxin treated her.

But she had feelings for Qiao Ruhai.

How could she not be sad to be hurt by someone she cared about?

“If you know that I’ve already settled the matter, why are you still looking for me?”

“I was worried about you.” The man looked at her deeply. “So, I came. Now it seems like I really made the right decision. Otherwise, I wouldn’t even know that my baby was bullied and wronged.

Qiao Mianmian felt much better.

But hearing the man’s gentle words of comfort, she suddenly felt a lump in her throat and her eyes reddened.

She really felt aggrieved.

“You’re crying?” Mo Yesi pinched her chin and looked at her teary eyes. He frowned. “Why are you crying? Did I say something wrong?”
