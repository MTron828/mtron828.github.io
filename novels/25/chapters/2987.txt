Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

Mo Shixiu and Mo Yesi stood on the stage in their white suits, looking in the same direction, waiting for the brides to appear.

A moment later, someone exclaimed happily, “Ah, the brides are out.”

Everyone looked in the same direction.

In the forest not far away, two stunningly beautiful brides were carefully helped out by two outstanding men. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

At that moment, they seemed to see elves running out of the forest.

One of the two brides was elegant and beautiful, like an otherworldly fairy.

The other was beautiful and had lovely facial features.

They were both stunning and unforgettable beauties.

But the two of them were such outstanding friends, and they were even married to the Mo brothers. This was a blessing that many people envied.

Everyone thought that Mo Shixiu and Mo Yesi would marry ladies from prestigious families.

But in the end, Mo Shixiu, who was once chosen as the nation’s Prince Charming, married an ordinary girl with an ordinary family background.

Although Mo Yesi’s wife, Qiao Mianmian, had been acknowledged by the Bai family and her background matched Mo Yesi’s, she hadn’t been found by the Bai family when Mo Yesi married her.

Back then, she was just like Jiang Luoli.

Both of them were real Cinderellas.

They married outstanding princes and were leading blissful lives.

“Gosh, my baby is so beautiful today.” Mother Bai’s eyes welled up when she saw her daughter in a wedding dress and holding a bouquet of flowers.

“Yes, Mianmian is very beautiful today.” Father Bai sighed. “Time flies. In the blink of an eye, our daughter is getting married.”

“Sigh, I really can’t bear for Mianmian to get married so early.” Mother Bai wiped her tears, looking both happy and a little sad. “I wanted her to stay by my side for a few more years. But seeing how happy she is now, and how well Yesi treats her, I’m happy for her too.”

Father Bai held his wife’s hand and wiped her tears. He smiled and said, “Didn’t you tell me that Mianmian and Yesi are planning to buy a house near us? By then, it’ll be rather convenient for you to see your daughter.”

“That’s right, but they’re living their own lives. How can we elders get involved? I just hope that Mianmian can give birth to a grandchild for me soon. That way, I can help take care of him in the future.”

Old people loved excitement.

Mother Bai was no exception.

Qiao Mianmian was married, and Bai Yusheng wasn’t home every day. Even with her husband accompanying her, she couldn’t help but feel lonely sometimes.

It would be so much more lively if a child was at home.

In the first row.

Wearing a red Tang suit, Old Madam smiled when she saw her two beautiful granddaughters-in-law walking out. She turned to Mo Yunchen and said, “Yunchen, you’re so lucky. Your two daughters-in-law are as beautiful as flowers.

“Seeing these two girls, I suddenly remember my grand wedding with your dad. Our wedding was also held by the sea, and the weather was so good that day. It was bright and sunny
