Chapter 2777: You Have to Be Careful

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Zhan Bo is right. I noticed it, too.” Qin Han recalled the situation. “Mianmian, she didn’t look at you kindly. You don’t know her?”

Qiao Mianmian shook her head.

“I wanted to ask you the same thing. Do you know each other?” Zhan Bo frowned. “How could anyone be so mean to the person they met for the first time? Anyway, Brother Han and I can tell that she’s not a nice person. You have to be careful.

“I feel like this woman is up to something.”

Qiao Mianmian kept quiet.

She hadn’t noticed anything off about Jiang Xinyue.

Hence, she didn’t notice that Jiang Xinyue was looking at her with a friendly and hostile gaze.

But since Zhan Bo and Qin Han said so, it couldn’t be false.

So why was Jiang Xinyue hostile towards her?

Under normal circumstances, even if she didn’t like someone, she would only dislike them after interacting with them.

She didn’t know Jiang Xinyue.

There was no old grudge.

But if they didn’t have any old grudges, why would she be hostile towards her when they just met?

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t figure it out.

But she felt that no matter what kind of person Jiang Xinyue was, and whether she had any ulterior motives, it was useless to worry now.

She could only deal with whatever came her way.

…

Qiao Anxin was eating at a high-end restaurant when she received Su Ze’s call.

She had just eaten a tender steak. She sipped her red wine and said coquettishly, “What’s there to be afraid of? The more people scold me, the more popular I will be. Otherwise, can I always be on the trending searches? If the netizens like to scold me, then let them. It’s best if they scold me until everyone knows that I, Jiang Xinyue, exist. Then, my goal will be achieved. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Didn’t you tell me that black is also a type of red? I remember that Qiao Mianmian was also trending on the negative news every few days. I’m just following her path now.

“Before I came to this show, I already knew that many people would scold me. As long as I can be on the hot searches every day, I can quickly become famous. They can scold me however they want.”

Su Ze kept quiet for a while before saying mockingly, “Qiao Anxin, your ability to resist pressure is much better than before. If it was in the past, you’d definitely tell me to get someone to clear your name.”

“That’s in the past.” Qiao Anxin took a sip of red wine and narrowed her eyes. “I’m different now. Also, didn’t I tell you to call me Jiang Xinyue? I’m Jiang Xinyue now!”

“Alright, why are you pretending in front of me?” Su Ze said disdainfully. “I call you Jiang Xinyue in front of others, but you’re still the Qiao Anxin I know. I know what you’re worried about. I’m at home alone now, and there’s no one else around. What are you afraid of?”

Qiao Anxin felt uncomfortable.

She used to be an idiot.

She changed her appearance and gave herself a new name just to have a new life.

A new life as glorious as Qiao Mianmian’s.
