“Miss Qiao, gentlemen, enjoy yourselves. If you need anything, feel free to look for me.” Chairman Lin left after bringing them to the VIP room.

Zhan Bo laid on the sofa as if he was boneless. He then exclaimed, “Lady Boss’s treatment is really different. This private room is too big and luxurious. Qiao Mianmian, I’ve made up my mind. I’ll follow you from now on. How about I call you Sister Qiao?”

Qiao Mianmian glared at him. “I don’t mind you following me, but I’m afraid your manager won’t agree to it.”

“Why should I care? He can’t control me. I don’t care. Anyway, I’ll follow you in the future!”

“Alright.” Qiao Mianmian pretended to consider it for a few seconds and then said seriously, “I’ll get someone to create an agency contract later. You’ll be my artiste in the future and earn money for me. I promise you’ll live a good life.”

“Alright. You said it yourself, don’t regret it!”

Qin Han smiled and shook her head.

Thankfully, Qiao Mianmian’s husband wasn’t here. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Otherwise, Zhan Bo wouldn’t even know how he died.

Qiao Mianmian’s husband… was a jealous lover.

Thankfully, Zhan Bo didn’t have any feelings for Qiao Mianmian. Otherwise, he would have died even worse.

That Chairman Mo would never show mercy to men who coveted Qiao Mianmian.

Even the Young Master of the Gong family had fallen out with him.

Not to mention an outsider.

Although both parties had refuted the rumors and said that it had nothing to do with Qiao Mianmian, everyone knew very well whether it had everything to do with her.

…

In front of the mirror.

Qiao Anxin was dressed meticulously. She touched her face and looked at herself in the mirror. After confirming that she was sufficiently beautiful and attractive, she turned around in satisfaction and picked up the peach red crocodile skin bag.

Two hours ago, she received a call from Su Ze.

He told her that Gong Zeli was in C City and would spend the night at the Lan Ya Pavilion.

He wanted her to create an opportunity to show her face in front of him.

This was undoubtedly good news for Qiao Anxin.

After seeing Qiao Mianmian again, all the hatred from the past was ignited. Seeing Qiao Mianmian get better and better, the hatred and jealousy in her heart deepened.

The Qiao Mianmian did better, the more she hated her, and the more she wanted to tear her apart.

How could that slut have everything she wanted?

And she obtained everything so easily.

And she…

Because of that slut, she lost everything.

Coupled with the way Qiao Mianmian humiliated her today, Qiao Anxin hated her even more.

She wanted to return all the humiliation she’d suffered.

No, she had to return it double.

She wanted to let that slut have a taste of being trampled on and humiliated.

But given her current situation, she had nowhere to vent her anger.

So what if she hated Qiao Mianmian?

So what if she wanted to kill her?

Qiao Mianmian had the backing of the Bai and Mo families.
