Chapter 441: What Must We Do to Earn Your Forgiveness?

With a remorseful look, she said, “I’m really sorry. Please give us a chance to redeem ourselves.”

They had just received a scolding from the principal.

It was because their actions caused a lot of trouble for the school.

They offended a very powerful person.

The person was angered by their actions and requested for them to be punished.

“Apologize to Qiao Mianmian and ask for her forgiveness. If she doesn’t forgive you, you guys will have to fend for yourselves.”

As she recalled what the principal said, Bai Xiao tightened her resolve.

She had to do it even though she really didn’t want to.

The more humble she appeared, the stronger her hatred for Qiao Mianmian grew.

“Mianmian, we’re sorry. We were rash... We won’t do it in the future.” Zhang Yuwei apologized as well. “We’ve known each other for three years already. Please forgive us.”

The others heard their apology and shifted their focus to Qiao Mianmian.

They wanted to know her answer. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Jiang Luoli turned to Qiao Mianmian as well.

Qiao Mianmian stayed silent for a moment before replying coldly, “If an apology solved everything, why would we need the police for? If you really considered our friendship of three years, you wouldn’t have done it. You didn’t really care about our friendship at all.”

“So why should I care?” Qiao Mianmian said as she glanced at the two of them. Then, she bit on her lip and continued coldly, “I believe that I have made it really clear just now. We’re no longer friends. I’m sorry, I cannot forgive you both.”

The other students were shocked by her reply.

They really thought that Qiao Mianmian wouldn’t reject their apology so directly in front of everyone.

Hence, they were shocked by her reply.

But no one thought that she was being unreasonable.

No one would have been happy if something similar happened to them.

In fact, it would’ve been weird if Qiao Mianmian forgave them just like that.

Bai Xiao frowned.

She thought that Qiao Mianmian would have forgiven her after her sincere apology.

She felt humiliated.

She wanted to leave.

But thinking about what the principal said, she suppressed her anger.

The humiliation that she was going through now was nothing compared to being expelled.

No matter what happened, they could not be expelled.

“Mianmian, I understand that you’re really angry now. What we have done was really horrible. I understand if you don’t want to forgive us. But we’re really sorry. What must we do to earn your forgiveness? We’re willing to do anything to be forgiven by you.”

Zhang Yuwei nodded and agreed. “Yes, what must we do to earn your forgiveness? We’ll do it straight away.”

Zhang Yuwei was furious as well.

There were so many people watching, and everyone saw their apology to Qiao Mianmian.

But her attitude was still so cold.

She wasn’t going to accept their apology.

They were humiliated.

But no matter how angry they were, they couldn’t leave.
