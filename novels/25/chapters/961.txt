Chapter 963: How Did She Offend You?

Yan Shaoqing frowned. “Fourth Bro, what are you doing?”

“Don’t worry about it.” Gong Zeli clenched his fists and looked at him coldly. “I know what you’re worried about. I know what to do. Second Bro, I’ll say it again. I’ll go back immediately!”

...

An hour later.

Gong Zeli got off the yacht and received a message from his subordinate.

After reading all the news, his expression darkened and his eyes turned colder.

He called Shen Rou.

Soon, she picked up.

Shen Rou was pleasantly surprised. “Zeli, is that you?”

Gong Zeli kept quiet for a few seconds before replying calmly, “It’s me.”

“It’s really you.” Shen Rou sounded excited. “Zeli, why did you call me? Do you know that I was so happy when I saw your name on the screen? I thought you’d never call me again.

“Zeli, can we meet? I still want to talk to you about what happened that day. I know you’re still angry with me, and I know you won’t forgive me easily. But on account of our years of friendship, can you give me a chance to make amends?

“Ever since I left you that day, I realized that I can’t live without you.”

As she spoke, she choked. “You’ve been ignoring me all these days. I called you, but you didn’t pick up. You didn’t even reply to my messages. I’m really not used to you treating me like this.

“When I called you in the past, you always picked up instantly. When I sent you a message, you replied instantly too. Zeli, you’ve pampered me for so many years, and now you’re suddenly so cold to me. I really feel like I’m better off dead.

“Can we really not go back to the past?”

Gong Zeli’s heart softened as he listened to her.

Just as he was about to console her, he suddenly recalled the news he’d just read.

“You said you wanted to meet? Alright, let’s meet.”

Shen Rou was stunned for a while before asking in surprise, “Really? You’re really willing to meet me? Alright, Zeli. I’ll look for you right away. Let’s meet at the same place. I’ll be there in half an hour.”

“Alright.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Gong Zeli hung up.

He opened the message his subordinate sent him.

The message only had two words: Shen Rou.

...

Half an hour later.

Gong Zeli arrived at the appointed place.

The waiter led him to the private room Shen Rou had booked.

Shen Rou arrived early and was already sitting inside.

Seeing Gong Zeli walk in, she stood up excitedly and called out with reddened eyes, “Zeli, you’re here.”

Gong Zeli nodded.

The waiter closed the door.

Shen Rou took another step forward and reached out to hold his hand. “Zeli, I...”

Gong Zeli quietly turned around and avoided her hand. “Shen Rou, let’s talk about it.”

He looked up and said coldly, “Why did you do that? What did she do to offend you? Why do you have to hold on to her over and over again?”
