Chapter 110: Even Breathing Became a Chore

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Mo Yesi pulled Qiao Mianmian into an embrace and kept an arm around her waist. He then looked up and swept a glance at him. “Now let me ask you. Baby, who is he? Did he bully you?”

Qiao Mianmian looked up and eyed Su Ze coldly. “He’s an unimportant person, you don’t need to know.”

Su Ze was shocked before his expression darkened. He could see the rivalry in Mo Yesi’s eyes. “I’m Qiao Mianmian’s fiancé. She and I...”

“Mr. Su, let me remind you. You and I have nothing to do with each other anymore,” Qiao Mianmian said with a blank expression. “We called our engagement off earlier on. Please get this clear, so you won’t utter nonsense to taint my reputation.”

Su Ze’s heart actually ached when he saw how distant and disgusted she looked.

He couldn’t identify why, but he felt upset and uncomfortable.

It was as if something was eating away at his heart.

Although he had long guessed that Qiao Mianmian would be with another man by now, it was a lot easier to deal with it when he hadn’t seen the man himself.

Now that he saw him in person, he felt a stab to his heart realizing that it was a young, handsome man who looked so good with her, and not an old fogey.

Even breathing became a chore.

“Mianmian, what’s your relationship with him? Is he the owner of that Rolls-Royce?” Su Ze asked her.

She was actually with another man now.

They had broken up for barely a week and she already found herself a new man!

He didn’t believe she had a change of heart so quickly.

For all the years they had been together, she had only had eyes for him.

She loved him so much. For his sake, she turned from a pampered miss to a domesticated lady who could cook and do chores well.

She had said that she felt happy to be doing these things for him.

For his sake, she was willing to change herself.

She even said that she, Qiao Mianmian, would only ever like a man named Su Ze in this lifetime.

And that she would only be Su Ze’s bride.

He remembered every word clearly.

Every single one.

He simply could not believe that given the love she had for him, she could put their relationship behind her so quickly.

This man that she got together with must have been to spite him.

Or that she wanted to use this man as a means to forget him.

Didn’t they all say that the easiest way to forget a person was to be in another relationship?

The more she did this, the more she proved that she still loved him and could not forget him.

With that thought, Su Ze felt better about himself.

“It’s none of your business. Who are you to interrogate Mianmian with that tone!” Before Mo Yesi and Qiao Mianmian even said a thing, Jiang Luoli came forward to rebut Su Ze first.

With Mo Yesi around, she was even more fearless. She pointed Su Ze in the nose and told him off mercilessly. “You’re a cheating man, what right have you to ask her this way? Mianmian already said you’ve broken up, that makes the both of you strangers. What has her life got to do with you at all?”Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎
