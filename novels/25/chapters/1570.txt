Chapter 1571: It Seems Like You Really Admire This Newbie

“Sister Shen.” Before she left, she waved at Shen Fei. “We’ll meet again in the future. Thank you for your encouragement.”

“Alright, see you next time.” Shen Fei smiled.

A moment later.

Qiao Mianmian left.

Shen Fei looked at the director in confusion. “Director Cheng, I think she performed very well. What are you dissatisfied with?” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The performance just now wasn’t perfect.

But for a newbie, it was pretty good.

Shen Fei felt that it would be a pity if the director didn’t consider using her just because of his reputation.

Like Qin Han, she cherished talent, so she couldn’t bear to see Qiao Mianmian being dismissed.

“She did well.” The director nodded.

Shen Fei was even more confused. “Then, why did you...”

“I didn’t say I don’t need her.” The director smiled at her. “Why, it’s the first time you’re meeting a newbie. Why are you so concerned about her? Is it because of Qin Han, or is it because of other reasons?”

“It has something to do with Qin Han, but not much.”

Shen Fei smiled and said honestly, “I admire this newbie. Director Cheng, we’re old friends. Just tell me directly if you need her or not. I think her acting is pretty good and she’s pretty. She’s still lacking in popularity, but Director Cheng’s films will still sell even if you use newbies.”

Shen Fei smiled. “Director Cheng, what do you think?”

“Hahaha.”

Director Cheng laughed. “Shen Fei, it seems like you really admire this newbie. In order for me to use her, you actually flattered me. This isn’t your usual style.”

“Director Cheng, I’m not flattering you. I’m just speaking the truth. It’s just a suggestion. The final decision is in your hands.”

“Don’t worry.”

Director Cheng said, “If it’s a promising talent, I won’t bury it.”

“With Director Cheng’s words, I’m relieved. Then, about my audition, I...”

“Come on, this isn’t the first time I’m working with you, why are you still auditioning?” Director Cheng waved his hand. “Just go through the process. Go back and wait for the contract.”

Shen Fei nodded and left.

The others had no objections.

Everyone knew how good Shen Fei’s acting was. Moreover, this wasn’t their first time working together.

Some candidates were already decided.

People like Shen Fei were just here for formality’s sake.

After Shen Fei left.

The director didn’t let the next group of actors in immediately.

He turned to the scriptwriter and producer. “What do you think of that newbie?”

“Her crying scene was very good. Very infectious. I can tell that you really like acting, not playing around. If you ask for my opinion, I think she can be used.” The scriptwriter was at the top of the industry. The movies he produced all sold well.

Hence, he had some authority over the actors.

“Yes, I think so too,” the producer said. “I heard from Qin Han that she’s Bai Yusheng’s cousin. I have to take care of Bai Yusheng’s sister no matter what.”

The director nodded. “Since you think she’s useful, leave her a role.”

The scriptwriter smiled. “Director Cheng, you’d already decided before you asked us.”
