Chapter 70: This Hunk Is Actually Here for Qiao Mianmian

Qiao Mianmian went quiet.

She was thinking about this too.

Should she be the one to say hi to Mo Yesi first?

Or... pretend she didn’t know him?

She thought for a while and guessed that he would surely be upset if she did the latter.

Before coming to a conclusion, she saw a shadow right before her.

She looked up and saw that handsome face. His cold, black eyes looked straight at her for a good few seconds before he reached out to cup her face.

His voice was cold, and there seemed to be a hint of anger. “What happened here? You’re injured?”

“I...” Qiao Mianmian opened her mouth.

Before she could say anything, the man’s expression went colder. He grabbed one of her hands and said, “You’re injured here too.”

A layer of ice seemed to cover his face. When he spoke again, the low voice was colder than before. “Who inflicted these wounds on you?”

The man’s presence was very imposing.

That statement sounded like an interrogation, and everyone around felt a sense of fear.

Even the previously excited girls were taken aback by his sudden coldness.

Qiao Mianmian was a little frightened too.

She bit her lip for a few seconds before finally saying, “I’m fine, it’s just some minor injuries.”

Mo Yesi pursed his lips and gave her a glare before picking her up horizontally.

Someone gasped.

“What’s going on? That hunk is actually here for Qiao Mianmian?”

“Damn it, is that Qiao Mianmian’s new boyfriend? She broke up with Su Ze, and she’s found another handsome one so soon?”

“So, that group of people wasn’t called by Su Ze, but this man?”

“I heard Su Ze dumped Qiao Mianmian because she was cheating on him. Could it be this man she was having an affair with? Honestly, he does seem way more charismatic than Su Ze. They’re of a different league altogether.”

Everyone got agitated over the way Mo Yesi carried her in his arms.

A lot of discussions could be heard.

Jiang Luoli was more shocked than anyone else there. She looked at her good friend, and then at Mo Yesi, and then back at her. “Baby, w-what’s going on here?”

Why was this hunk carrying her like this?!

Qiao Mianmian’s face went red from being carried like this.

She struggled for a bit, but his grip only tightened. He looked down and said, “Don’t you move. Otherwise, I’ll kiss you here in public.”

Everyone thought he was some unapproachable man...

But now he wasn’t anything like it!

He seemed to want to take advantage of her, just like a hooligan!

“Put me down, Mo Yesi.” Qiao Mianmian’s face was scorching as she hit him lightly on the chest. “Everyone’s watching, what are you trying to do?”

“So what if people are watching,” Mo Yesi said softly, his low voice numbing her ears. “You’re my wife. If I don’t carry you, who will I carry?”

“But... I can walk on my own.”
