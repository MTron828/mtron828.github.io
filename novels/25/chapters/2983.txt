“You think there’s still hope for Shen Xin and me to be together, right?”

“If she still likes you, as long as you’re both firm enough, there’s still hope.

“But this depends on Shen Xin’s choice. If she’s willing to fight for you with her parents, you’ll still have hope.”

‘The light in Qiao Chen’s eyes faded.

“So, it still depends on Shen Xin’s attitude?” He lowered his eyes and murmured, “No matter how I fight for it, if she decides to alienate me, we still have no hope of being together.

“How could she go against her parents for me? She’s an obedient and sensible girl, and she’s very filial to her parents. She’s alienated me because of her parents, so how could she fight for me with them?”

“Then, if your positions were swapped, would you be willing to fight for her?”

“I would,” Qiao Chen replied without hesitation. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Qiao Mianmian smiled and asked gently, “So, how can you be sure that she’s unwilling?”

Qiao Chen was stunned and confused. “Then, then, what should I do? She turns around and leaves the moment she sees me. She ignores me when I talk to her. She treats me like air.”

“You can only be a little more thick-skinned.” Qiao Mianmian wasn’t that much more experienced in love herself, but she tried to impart her experience to her brother. “Don’t care how she treats you. Just stick to her and chase her.

“But the premise is that you have to find a way to confirm her feelings for you. As long as she still likes you, you have to do as I say.

“Chase her the way she chased you. You can’t be inferior to a girl in this aspect.”

Qiao Chen thought for a while and looked up with a smile. “Sister, I know what to do.

“Oh, right. Sister, your movie was released today. I haven’t congratulated you on the box office sales. Many of my classmates went to watch the premiere in the morning and told me that the ticket prices were very worth it, especially the second female lead role you played. They all felt that you were

amazing and that you acted very well.

“Sister, I think your movie is going to be a hit.”

Just as Qiao Chen said, Qiao Mianmian’s part in “Phoenix in Flight’ as the second female lead was really popular.

The premiere collected close to 200 million yuan.

The total box office earnings on the first day of screening reached over 400 million yuan.

This number shocked everyone in the industry.

It wasn’t that there hadn’t been any movies with high box office earnings in the past, but if a movie could have a box office of a billion yuan from the day it was released to the day it was taken off the shelves, it would be considered a very good result.

What did it mean for “Phoenix in Flight” to earn 400 million yuan on the first day of its release?

This meant that the box office results of this movie would surpass any other movie in the past, and it would definitely crush them.

Qiao Mianmian’s second female lead role received unanimous praise. Many netizens said that the one who left the deepest impression on them wasn’t the male lead or female lead, but the second female lead.

In the last scene, Qiao Mianmian was wearing a red dress. Her black hair was let down, and she was looking up at the sky with tears in her eyes.
