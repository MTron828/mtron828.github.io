Chapter 2795: I Can Only Accept It

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Mo Yesi: [I’m not stopping you from interacting with the opposite sex.]

Qiao Mianmian: [Did you ask the production crew for the male and female guests to live separately?]

Mo Yesi: [I did. But I don’t think I did anything wrong.]

Qiao Mianmian was about to reply when he called.

Qiao Mianmian picked it up.

“I was waiting for your call today. I know you’re busy and can’t contact me, so I’ve been waiting for you to contact me. I waited for half a day and finally got your WeChat message. Are you planning to fight with me?”

Qiao Mianmian could hear the hint of grievance in his low and alluring voice.

Before she could say anything, the man continued, “Baby, I miss you.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She didn’t intend to fight with Mo Yesi, she just wanted to reason with him.

But now, his “Baby, I miss you” made Qiao Mianmian forget what she wanted to say.

“Have you thought about me?” Mo Yesi didn’t seem to want to continue the unpleasant topic. He only wanted to tell his wife how much he loved her.

Qiao Mianmian said, “We’ve only been apart for a few hours…”

“Mm, to be precise, four and a half hours.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“Every minute is a long time for me without you.”

“Mo Yesi, aren’t you exaggerating?” Qiao Mianmian was amused.

The man sounded a little aggrieved. “I’m telling the truth. How could a heartless little ingrate like you know how important you are to me? So, you haven’t thought of me?”

“Uh…” Qiao Mianmian opened her mouth.

“I knew you were a heartless ingrate.” Mo Yesi sighed and admitted defeat. “I must have owed you in my previous life to make me like you in this life.”

Qiao Mianmian was amused by his bitterness. “It’s not too late to regret it now.”

“It’s too late.” Mo Yesi sighed again. “My heart has been stolen by you, you ingrate. I can only accept it. Forget it, it’s fine if you don’t miss me. You just have to know that I miss you.”

Qiao Mianmian put it on speaker.

Hence, her conversation with Mo Yesi was heard by the netizens on the live stream.

And they heard it clearly.

The live stream was in an uproar because of the call.

“Damn, Chairman Mo looks so cold and abstinent, but this is how he talks to his wife in private?”

“It turns out that the purer and more abstinent a man looks, the more passionate he is. Oh my, Chairman Mo’s sweet words are so mushy. It turns out that he and Qiao Mianmian are so romantic in private. I thought that a cold man like him wouldn’t know how to coax women.”

“Hahaha, did Qiao Mianmian forget she’s in a live stream? I wonder how Mo Yesi will feel if he found out that his sweet words were heard by us netizens.”

…

Qiao Mianmian had really forgotten that she was in a live stream.

Otherwise, she wouldn’t have put it on speaker.

She was a little confused and thought that she was still at home.

After she ended the call with Mo Yesi, she wanted to go to the live stream to take a look. Only when she saw the comments did she remember that she had turned on the speaker!

She blushed as she read the comments.
