Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

An hour later.

Qiao Mianmian turned around weakly and glared at the man beside her. She said in a hoarse voice, “I’m hungry.”

“Mm, what do you want to eat, Baby?”

“I can eat anything I want?”

“Mm, of course.”

The man was in a good mood. He smiled happily and reached out to caress her face.

Mo Yesi wasn’t exactly satisfied. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

He felt that he would never be enough for Qiao Mianmian.

His satisfaction came from his heart, not his body.

Every time he wanted her, he enjoyed the feeling of having her completely.

At that moment, he felt that she truly belonged to him.

Qiao Mianmian recalled how badly he had bullied her and glared at him. “I don’t want to eat takeaway.”

Mo Yesi smiled and nodded. “Alright, no takeaway.”

“I don’t want to go out too.”

“Alright, we won’t go out to eat.”

“Make it for me!” She knew that he didn’t know how to cook and deliberately made things difficult for him. “I want to eat sweet-and-sour spare ribs.”

Mo Yesi was silent for a moment.

Qiao Mianmian immediately slapped his hand away and pretended to be angry. “Forget it, I knew it would be like this. I just said it casually. You’re a young master who has never done any household chores, what do you know how to cook.

“I’ll just order takeaway.”

She reached for the cell phone on the bedside table and opened the app.

The moment she opened it, she heard the man behind her say hesitantly, “You really... want to eat my food? I’ve never made sweet-and-sour spare ribs, but if you really want to eat it, I can learn it now.”

Qiao Mianmian turned to look at him. “You’re really willing to do it?”

Mo Yesi nodded helplessly, but his eyes were full of affection. “If you want to eat it, I’ll make it. Baby, as long as you’re happy, there’s nothing I can’t do. Just don’t find it awful.”

He didn’t have much confidence in his culinary skills.

Besides the time he boiled brown sugar water for her, he had never entered the kitchen before.

But if she really wanted to eat his food, he could learn for her.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t expect Mo Yesi would agree.

She was deliberately making things difficult for him because she was still angry.

What would he cook?

She probably couldn’t even cook a tomato fried egg well, let alone sweet-and-sour spare ribs.

But when he finally agreed, she was suddenly interested.

She stared at him for a while and then frowned. “But there’s no kitchen or ingredients here.”

“These aren’t problems.”

Mo Yesi was silent for a few seconds before turning around and making a call.

Qiao Mianmian heard him say in a low voice, “I need a house and some ingredients for sweet-and-sour spare ribs. Hmm, I’ll get some of the rest too. I want what girls like.”
