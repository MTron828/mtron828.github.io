Chapter 972: As Much as You Can

Linda was speechless.

“Linda, I don’t care what you do, but you have to keep her in the office!” Zhao Kai grabbed Linda’s hand tightly as if he’d forgotten what he’d said. He smiled shamelessly and said, “Such a talent cannot be taken advantage of by our opponent.”

Linda was speechless.

Was this shameless man really her boss?

This was too much.

What happened to not daring to offend Young Lady Shen?

Now that he knew that Qiao Mianmian had a stronger backing, he immediately changed his mind.

He wasn’t afraid of offending anyone anymore.

He even said something like that.

And he wasn’t even blushing.

Linda looked at him disdainfully and didn’t take him seriously at all. She said sarcastically, “Chairman Zhao, are you sure you don’t want to terminate the contract with her? Don’t tell me you’ve changed your mind after I’ve talked to her.

“What if Young Lady Shen gets angry and wants to settle things with you?”

Zhao Kai could tell that she was mocking him. He smiled and said cheekily, “The Mo Corporation has already made its stance clear. What’s there to be afraid of? Moreover, if Young Lady Shen and Chairman Mo have to offend each other, who are you going to choose? I’m being sensible, understand?

“Offending Young Lady Shen would at most offend her. But if I offend the Chairman of the Mo Corporation...” As Zhao Kai spoke, he couldn’t help but shudder. “It’s just a mere Huan Yu, isn’t it as easy as killing us?

“But it’s strange. Since that newbie is his girlfriend and he values her so much, why didn’t he sign her in his own company?”

Linda looked at him as if he was an idiot. “Chairman Zhao, have you forgotten that the Mo Corporation isn’t involved in the entertainment industry? The Mo Corporation doesn’t have an artiste management company under them, how could he sign Qiao Mianmian?”

Zhao Kai was speechless.

He really forgot.

Now that he thought about it, the Mo Corporation did have a management company. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Strangely enough, the Mo Corporation was involved in almost every profitable industry.

For example, the finance industry, the property industry, the large-scale chain malls, the jewelry industry, the electric commercial...

They were even involved in eSports.

But they weren’t involved in the entertainment industry.

It was said that Old Master Mo didn’t like the entertainment industry and wasn’t interested in it. Hence, despite investing in so many industries, he didn’t invest in the entertainment industry.

At the thought of Qiao Mianmian’s identity, Zhao Kai couldn’t help but sigh. “Although that newbie is really capable to have such a huge backing like the Chairman of the Mo Corporation, I wonder how long this Chairman Mo’s freshness will last.

“I hope he won’t get sick of it in a few months. When you meet her at night, talk to her properly, and let her be smart. Make sure to grab the opportunity. While he still likes her and is willing to invest in her, ask for resources when it’s time to do so. Try your best to ask for as much as you can. Don’t wait until it’s too late.”

Just the fact that the Mo Corporation was unwilling to invest in the entertainment industry alone was enough to prove that the newbie would never marry into the Mo family.

The Mo family didn’t invest in it because they didn’t like the entertainment industry.

Even if they didn’t care about their background, they couldn’t accept someone from the entertainment industry.
