Chapter 944: Suicide-like Terror

“I’m not worried about Qiao Mianmian being with him. He can protect her. There are many things he can do that I can’t.”

Michael was overjoyed to see that he’d finally figured it out and decided to give up.

He immediately said, “Yes, he’s the Chairman of the Mo Corporation. How many people can match up to the Mo family’s power and influence? With him protecting her, Qiao Mianmian won’t suffer any losses. If you really decide to go overseas for a year, I’ll arrange it for you when you’re better and can be discharged.

“You haven’t had much rest in the past few years. Actually, it’s good to take this opportunity to rest and recuperate. I was worried that the Mo guy would give me a blank cheque, but since he’s the Chairman of the Mo Corporation, I have nothing to worry about now.

“With him around to help you, you can rest well this year.”

Tu Yilei pursed his lips as if he wanted to say something.

But after some thought, he dismissed the idea.

He looked into Michael’s warm and caring eyes and nodded. “Mm.”

He couldn’t let Michael worry about him anymore.

All these years, Michael had put in so much effort to make him popular.

At this point, he could no longer do as he wished.

He could reject Mo Yesi’s compensation and help without any psychological burden if he was alone.

But he wasn’t.

Even if he didn’t want to, he couldn’t reject anyone who cared about him.

Most of the time, pride was nothing in front of reality.

...

Tu Yilei’s Weibo post caused a huge sensation.

His fans didn’t believe that he would choose to study overseas for a year when he was the most popular. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Not only his fans but many people in the industry were also puzzled and shocked by his actions.

Few artistes had such guts.

He dared to retire for a year when he was most popular.

This required a lot of confidence and courage.

No matter how popular an artiste was, once they left the public eye for a year, they might be forgotten.

The entertainment industry was full of newbies. If they were still popular today, they might be replaced by newbies tomorrow.

Hence, not many artistes dared to choose to temporarily retire at their peak like Tu Yilei.

This was practically suicide.

When Tu Yilei’s Weibo post was posted, his studio and fans quickly reposted it, saying that no matter what decision he made, they would support him and follow him.

The topic of him temporarily retiring from the entertainment industry for a year quickly became trending.

As this news was too sudden and the content was too shocking, the sudden increase in popularity caused the entire Weibo platform to be paralyzed for more than 10 minutes. Even Weibo’s CEO posted a Weibo complaining that Tu Yilei had increased the workload of their employees.

In any case, the topic of Tu Yilei going overseas to study for a year was firmly at the top of Weibo’s trending topics.

Almost everyone on Weibo was discussing this.

His fans were going crazy.

Xiaoxiao: Ah, why did Brother suddenly decide to study abroad? Didn’t he just take on a television drama? If he goes to study abroad, what about the television drama? Will he stop filming?
