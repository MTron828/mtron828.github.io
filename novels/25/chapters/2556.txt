“I didn’t expect her car to crash right after she said that. The car accident was really scary. Everyone has to drive carefully and follow the traffic rules.”

When the news first came out, the netizens didn’t believe it.

But as more and more people in the comment section proved that it was true, the netizens gradually turned around.

Then, some netizens posted on Weibo to prove that this was true.

Some netizens even posted photos and videos of the accident.

Some netizens checked the red Maserati’s license plate number and found that the owner’s name was indeed Shen Rou.

At this point, the truth of the matter was almost confirmed.

Another 10 minutes passed.

Yuncheng City Police Department posted on Weibo.

It was reported that a tailgating accident happened at the airport highway at 10:00 PM.

The owner of the car was a female, 25 years old, surnamed Shen, and was currently the CEO of the Shen Corporation.

The owner of the car was sent to the hospital for emergency treatment because of her serious injuries. Her condition was unknown.

Yuncheng City Police Department’s post confirmed that Shen Rou had indeed been in a car accident.

The netizens got even more excited.

“Damn, it’s actually true. I thought it was fake news. Looking at it, it feels like the person can’t be saved. The front of the car has been hit so badly, can the person inside… still be alive?”

“I also think the chances of being rescued are very small. She wasn’t a drunk, so why did she speed so much? Could it be because of her negative news that she was agitated and deliberately courting death?”

“She wants to die, but she has to use such a method? Isn’t this harming herself and others? If she wants to die, can’t she find a place with no one around and die quietly? She drove so quickly on the highway. If she didn’t hit a big truck, but a small car like hers, she definitely wouldn’t be the only one injured. Aren’t other car owners unlucky and innocent?”

“Am I the only one who thinks that the owner of the truck is unlucky? He just changed lanes normally. Who knew that the car behind was driving so fast? It’s so unlucky to have encountered such an incident.”

“Thankfully, it wasn’t in the city and there weren’t many cars on the road. Otherwise, she would’ve harmed many people.”

“I don’t pity people who seek their own deaths. I think this might be retribution. Humans can’t be too evil, or they’ll get retribution sooner or later.”

“The officials have already reported it, it seems like it’s true. This is really courting death, there’s nothing to pity. Don’t think that just because you’re rich and powerful, you can ignore the relevant rules. King of Hell doesn’t care about your background. Since you don’t care about your life, then I’ll take it back for you.”

“Shen Rou’s parents are at the hospital. I heard that she’s bleeding internally, and her heart has stopped twice. I guess her chances of surviving are slim. Sigh, it’s such a pity for such a beauty.”

“Yes, she’s so beautiful. It’s such a pity to die.”

“I realize that some people have bad values. Is it a pity to die because she’s beautiful? She drove so fast on the highway, it’s obvious that she doesn’t care about other people’s lives.. And you actually say that it’s a pity for her to die? You can’t be so indiscriminate.”nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
