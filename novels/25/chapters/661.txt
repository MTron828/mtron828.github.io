Chapter 662: Call Me if You Need Anything in the Future

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Perhaps it was just a moment of interest.

If he liked her today, he wouldn’t like her tomorrow.

If he didn’t like her, this newbie would be in trouble.

If she offended Huang Yilin, she wouldn’t have a good ending.

“Director... Director Bai, there’s no need for that. This... this is too much trouble for you.” Qiao Mianmian knew that Bai Yusheng only took special care of her because of Yan Shaoqing.

But nobody knew.

Seeing how the people around were looking at her, she felt uncomfortable.

“I’ll just take the bus with the production team.”

Bai Yusheng raised his brows. “Are you sure?”

“I’m sure!” Qiao Mianmian nodded. “Thank you for your kind intentions, Director Bai, but I really don’t want to trouble you.”

She deliberately emphasized the word “you.”

She wanted everyone to know that she had no special relationship with Bai Yusheng.

But it didn’t seem to have much effect.

Everyone was already speculating about her relationship with him.

He looked at her deeply. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Bai Yusheng did not insist. He tapped his cell phone screen and smiled. “Alright, the production team’s bus is actually pretty good too. Remember to give me your contact details. Call me if you need anything in the future.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Why did she feel that Bai Yusheng’s words made it easier for others to misunderstand their relationship...

She could reject his offer to bring her to the set every day.

But if she refused to give him her contact details, she would appear too ungrateful.

And a public rejection at that.

Wasn’t this embarrassing for him?

Qiao Mianmian decided to tell him her cell phone number.

Bai Yusheng dialed her number and left after she saved it.

The moment he left, the quiet atmosphere became lively.

They gathered and whispered as they looked at Qiao Mianmian.

“Sister Mianmian, you know Director Bai?” Nana asked curiously.

Qiao Mianmian saved the number and locked her cell phone. She thought for a while before replying, “... I don’t think so. ”

She had only seen Bai Yusheng once during the audition.

Today was their second time meeting.

“But, Director Bai, just now...” Nana was just like everyone else, wondering if Bai Yusheng had that sort of intention towards Qiao Mianmian. After all, what he did seemed very obvious.

Although she didn’t know Bai Yusheng well, she had heard about him.

The rich and powerful young master wasn’t interested in inheriting his family’s hundreds of millions of assets. He wanted to be a film director and so studied acting in university.

Because of his family background and talent, he did well in the entertainment industry.

Many directors had to support their investors in their shows.

He was different.

He was an investor.

He was one of the investors of every movie.

Hence, he was a very proud man.

He didn’t think much of anyone.

He wouldn’t give his contact details to anyone easily.

In fact, not many people had Bai Yusheng’s contact details.

It was even rarer for him to give others his cell phone number.

Moreover, Qiao Mianmian was a newbie.
