Chapter 1105: Don’t You Think It’s Possible?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The Old Madam didn’t see Madam Mo and asked unhappily.

Mo Yesi said calmly, “She’s not feeling well and went back to the bedroom. She won’t be eating with us tonight.”

“Hmph.” The Old Madam knew that Madam Mo wasn’t really feeling unwell, but she didn’t expose her. “She doesn’t feel well early or late. The moment you guys came back, she already felt unwell. This illness is really timely. Forget it. Since she isn’t feeling well, let her be.”

The Old Madam couldn’t say anything in front of Qiao Mianmian and Qiao Chen.

She was extremely dissatisfied with Madam Mo’s actions.

In her opinion, her daughter-in-law came from a prestigious family and had always been the most well-behaved and polite. She would never do anything that did not suit her status.

But today, she had been too rude.

In front of a few juniors, her performance was extremely poor. She was completely unqualified as an elder.

Old Madam had always valued her face.

Madam Mo’s actions undoubtedly made her feel embarrassed.

How did the Qiao siblings view the Mo Family?

The younger brother might even think that his sister was being bullied in the Mo family.

...

Dinner proceeded in a pleasant mood.

Without Madam Mo around, everyone ate happily.

After dinner.

The Old Madam asked Uncle Zhang to take Qiao Mianmian and Qiao Chen for a walk in the backyard while she called Mo Yesi to her bedroom.

“Grandma, is there anything special about you calling me to your room alone?” Mo Yesi helped the old lady into the bedroom and closed the door.

He helped the old lady to the sofa and sat down.

The old lady sat on the sofa, deep in thought. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

After a while, she slowly raised her head and looked at Mo Yesi with her aged but clear eyes. “Ah Si, do you also think that Qiao Chen looks like your Second Uncle?”

At this moment, the old lady had a serious expression on her face. “Especially his eyes. Even his expression is exactly the same as your second uncle. Also, your second uncle’s ears are very unique and different from ordinary people.

“I noticed Qiao Chen’s ears just now. Do you know that his ears are exactly the same as your second uncle’s? Isn’t this too much of a coincidence? Even if many people in the world look alike, there aren’t many who look like him.”

As the old lady spoke, she became excited.

Mo Yesi could guess what the Old Madam wanted to tell him.

No wonder she wanted to talk to him alone.

Because he had thought of the same thing.

Although that thought had only flashed through his mind briefly, now that the Old Madam had brought it up so seriously, Mo Yesi also took it seriously.

“Grandma, are you suspecting that... Qiao Chen is Second Uncle’s child?”

The old lady’s expression changed. “Don’t you think it’s possible? He and your second uncle... are too similar. So similar that I have to think about it.”

“Grandma, I’ve thought about what you said before, but I’m afraid the possibility is very small. You shouldn’t have too much hope, lest you get disappointed.”

“How so?” Old Madam said agitatedly, “It’s fine if he looks like your second uncle, but even his ears are exactly the same. How can it be a coincidence? Also, I’ve asked him about the year he was born, it’s the same as your second uncle’s lost child.”
