Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Chairman Mo hardly ever smiled.

And even when he did, it was nothing like this.

This time, even he could tell that Chairman Mo was in a great mood.

It seemed like Chairman Mo was a little different since he got married.

Although he hadn’t exactly changed much, he could sense some difference on the inside.

To be more specific, he seemed more alive now, rather than a cold statue that he was before.

The current Chairman Mo was more human than before.

And this was all because of the Young Madam. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Well, love really had a way to change people.

Even someone as stone-cold as Chairman Mo could be softened.

Mo Yesi walked to the Chairman’s office and suddenly thought of something. He stopped in his tracks and turned around. “There’s one more thing for you to attend to.”

“Chairman Mo, please give your orders.”

Qiao Mianmian woke up from her nap after about an hour. She didn’t know that a lot had happened while she was sleeping.

She was walking out of the room and yawning when Jiang Luoli suddenly dashed before her.

“Baby, Baby, have you seen Weibo!”

Qiao Mianmian looked a little lost and shook her head. “No, what happened again?”

“Chen Chen is amazing.” Jiang Luoli looked so impressed. “He managed to find the person who made those posts. Someone posted the IP address on the forum and found the person behind those gossip posts a while ago. He even found and revealed the few top commenters.

“Damn, I didn’t think Zhang Yuwei and Bai Xiao were among them.

“It wasn’t as if you had anything against them, but they were so mean and menacing in their comments. I didn’t know they were so disgusting.

“Of course, the most disgusting of all is that white lily sister of yours. Damn it. She stole your man, and now she’s out there slandering you. I’ve never seen someone so gross.

“To think that you’ve been so merciful towards her. When she first joined the Qiao family, you didn’t even make things difficult for her. Why did she have to be so mean to you.”

Qiao Mianmian casually said, “Correction. From the point Su Ze lost control of his lower body, he stopped being my man.”

Qiao Mianmian was very appalled by Su Ze.

She couldn’t tolerate it if anyone tried to associate them together.

“Yes, yes. I said it wrongly. He’s not your man, he’s just a dog who can’t even control his lower body. But the main point is, Chen Chen is really awesome! Qiao Anxin is a hit on Weibo again.

“Now the whole internet knows just what despicable things she’s done. This time, I’ll see how she’s going to clean her image.

“She’s always portrayed herself as a kind and innocent girl. Now that she’s been caught fighting in public, spreading falsehoods about her sister, and even being the third party in her sister’s relationship, her image is going to be ruined. Haha, this is retribution. She deserves all of it.”

Jiang Luoli hated the white lily b*tch to the core.

And this white lily even bullied her best friend. That was the worst.

Qiao Mianmian took her cell phone and looked through Weibo.

She wasn’t as optimistic as Jiang Luoli to think that Qiao Anxin would be ruined so easily.
