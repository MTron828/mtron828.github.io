Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

But Mo Yesi quickly noticed him. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

When he saw that it was the man who was chatting happily with Qiao Mianmian in the photo, his eyes darkened and he asked, “Mr. Tu?”

Tu Yilei stopped in his tracks and turned to look at him.

“Mister, are you... calling me?”

Mo Yesi looked at him for a while and narrowed his eyes. “Other than you, is there anyone else with the surname Tu?”

Tu Yilei was sizing him up too.

Even though he didn’t know Mo Yesi’s identity, he was still in the entertainment industry, after all. To be able to get to where he was today from a newbie who had nothing to his name, his observation skills were definitely not bad.

Tu Yilei could tell that Mo Yesi’s status was extraordinary.

The man in front of him had an extremely handsome face, but he looked very unfamiliar. It was obvious that he wasn’t from their circle.

Moreover, his aura was so strong that no artiste in the entertainment industry could have it.

Tu Yilei felt pressured by his cold gaze.

“How can you be so rude?” Michael glared at Mo Yesi. “Do you know who our Little Tu is, talking to him like this?”

“Michael.”

Tu Yilei shot him a look.

Michael snorted and didn’t say anything else.

“Mister, what’s the matter?” Tu Yilei asked politely.

Mo Yesi’s expression was cold. “Nothing much. Just wanted to thank Mr. Tu.”

“Thank me?” Tu Yilei was confused. “Why? I don’t think we know each other.”

“We don’t know each other. This thank you is for my girlfriend.”

“Mister, I don’t understand...” Tu Yilei frowned.

“Qiao Mianmian is my girlfriend. I heard from her that you took good care of her, so I thanked you on her behalf.

“It’s getting late, I have to take her back to rest. Mr. Tu, let’s talk another day.”

With that, Mo Yesi left with Qiao Mianmian.

Tu Yilei was stunned.

It was only after Mo Yesi had walked a distance away that he snapped out of his daze.

He recalled that Mo Yesi was carrying a woman just now.

He hadn’t recognized her.

But now that he thought about it, he felt a sense of familiarity.

Even though that woman’s face was covered by her hair, it was obvious that she was Qiao Mianmian.

At this moment, Tu Yilei felt as if something was scratching his heart.

An indescribable pain spread from his heart.

Qiao Mianmian... had a boyfriend?

He’d never thought about it.

He thought she was still single...

“Little Tu Tu, did you hear it with your own ears? Did you saw it with your own eyes? Can you give up now?”

Michael shook his head and sighed. “That girl already has a boyfriend. And the man just now isn’t an ordinary person. He said those things to you for a reason. He must know something, that’s why he used that method to remind you.

“Don’t be silly anymore.

“Don’t think about her while your relationship isn’t deep enough.”
