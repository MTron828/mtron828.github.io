Chapter 547: Ah Si Doesn’t Love You, You Know That Very Well

“The Mo Yesi I know isn’t the same as the one Miss Shen knows.” Qiao Mianmian deliberately appeared shocked and curious. “I don’t think he has germophobia. People with germophobia don’t like kissing others, right? But he kisses me all the time.

“My lipstick barely stays on because he’s always taking them off.”

Shen Rou was speechless.

“Unless he has different standards for family members and outsiders?” Qiao Mianmian emphasized the word “outsiders” with an innocent expression.

Shen Rou’s expression changed further. She clenched her fists and said, “Qiao Mianmian, don’t think I will believe your words. Ah Si doesn’t like you at all. He only married you because of his disorder. There’s no point lying to me, I won’t believe you.”

“Haha. Miss Shen, why should I lie? Is it in your place to say whether my husband likes me or not? Do you think that as a wife, I’d understand my relationship any less than an outsider like you?

“If deceiving yourself makes you feel better, then go ahead.

“Anyway, I know that my husband loves me a lot.”

Qiao Mianmian did this on purpose.

She knew what Shen Rou minded the most, and she used it against her.

As she guessed, Shen Rou’s expression crumbled.

“Miss Qiao, you’re the one deceiving yourself.” Shen Rou was practically heaving from the anger, but she swallowed it anyway. “Ah Si doesn’t love you, you know that very well. There’s no use insisting on it in front of me when everyone knows the truth.”

Qiao Mianmian sneered. “The truth is that Mo Yesi has been entranced by my charm and is madly in love with me. Miss Shen, there’s no use insisting otherwise, because I’m clearer about the truth than anyone else.”

“You...” Shen Rou was about to mock her when she suddenly saw a slender figure at the doorway.

Someone opened the door.

Mo Yesi walked in, and Qiao Mianmian was in utter shock.

Wasn’t he in a meeting?

Didn’t Wei Zheng say that he’d take an hour before it ended?

When did he come over?

Did he hear all that she’d said?

The thought of that possibility embarrassed Qiao Mianmian.

She wanted to dig a hole to hide.

She only said it to spite Shen Rou because he wasn’t around.

And she’d just said that he was entranced by her charm, madly in love...

Just as Qiao Mianmian was feeling as awkward, the man walked to her and looked at her in the black leather seat.

The seat was wide and huge.

She looked so petite in it.

From his angle, he could see her long, lush hair, and some of the hickeys he’d left earlier that she’d been hiding.

The man’s eyes got deeper and darker.
