“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian turned around and lowered her voice. “She just fell asleep.”

Qin Han smiled. “She’s pretty obedient. She went to sleep after eating. I thought it would be difficult to take care of children, but it’s much easier than I thought.”

Qiao Mianmian nodded in agreement.

She’d thought that children were hard to take care of.

Especially such a delicate little girl.

But she didn’t expect Mengmeng to be so easygoing.

It wasn’t troublesome at all.

She ate her food obediently and watched the cartoon. Qiao Mianmian said that she could only watch two episodes, and Mengmeng didn’t insist on watching more.

She quickly fell asleep.

Qiao Mianmian felt that if children were so easy to raise, she wouldn’t mind having two.

After all, she only wanted to have a child previously because she felt that it was too troublesome to take care of them.

She felt that she wouldn’t be able to take care of the child.

But now, she was taking care of Mengmeng so easily. She naturally didn’t find it troublesome anymore.

“Yes, Mengmeng is really obedient and easy to take care of.” Qiao Mianmian smiled. “It seems like our first day’s task can be easily completed.”

“It’s a good thing I was paired with you.” Qin Han was generous with her praise. “You’re good at cooking, and Mengmeng likes it too. If both of us didn’t know how to cook, I’m afraid the first task would be a failure.”

“It wasn’t just me. Although you don’t know how to cook, I think you’re pretty good at coaxing children. If you hadn’t coaxed Mengmeng, I wouldn’t have been able to focus on cooking.”

“Alright, let’s not keep praising each other.” Qin Han smiled. “Do you want to take a nap? Go to my room.”

After the pairing, a man and a woman shared a room.

Two rooms were available for the guests.

Qiao Mianmian had just carried Mengmeng into her bedroom.

Qin Han was a gentleman, so he lent his room for Qiao Mianmian to take a nap.

“I…” Qiao Mianmian was about to say that she wasn’t sleepy and didn’t need her lunch break when she heard a knock on the door. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

She and Qin Han exchanged glances. Qin Han walked to the door and opened it.

Li Wei stood outside.

Qin Han smiled and asked, “Brother Li, what’s the matter?”

“Mm, there’s something.” Li Wei nodded. He looked past him at Qiao Mianmian, who was standing behind him. He paused for a while before saying, “The higher-ups have just informed us that some of the original arrangements have to be changed. Pack your luggage. The production crew has arranged a new room for the male guests. The male and female guests won’t live together anymore.”

Qin Han was stunned for a while but quickly regained his composure. “Are we moving out now?”

“Mm.” Li Wei nodded and looked at Qiao Mianmian. “Move out now.”

“Alright.” Qin Han didn’t ask why he suddenly asked all the male guests to leave, but he could guess why.. Li Wei’s eyes were on Qiao Mianmian when he spoke to him just now.
