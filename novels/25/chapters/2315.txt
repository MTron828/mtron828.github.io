Chapter 2316: Don’t Hit Me

“Wow, really? Thank you, sister.” Lin Wanwan’s best friend was especially happy and immediately took a picture with Qiao Mianmian.

“The lighting here isn’t too good.” Qiao Mianmian took her cell phone and clicked on the beauty camera. She suggested, “Why don’t we take a picture outside? It’s brighter in the corridor.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Alright, alright.” Lin Wanwan’s best friend quickly nodded. “Let’s go out and take photos. Can I take a few more photos with you? I really like your drama. Even if it’s only two episodes a day, it’s not enough.”

“Sister, do you know…”

Qiao Mianmian was dragged out of the private room.

Mo Yesi was speechless.

Seeing this, Yan Shaoqing was stunned for a few seconds before laughing out loud. “Sis-in-law is now a big star, and her fans are everywhere. You don’t say, my relatives are also watching the television drama she’s acting in. They all say that Sis-in-law is especially beautiful. When I tell them that I know her, do you know what they ask me?”

Mo Yesi looked at him coldly. “Ask what?”

Yan Shaoqing rubbed his nose. “Second Bro, are you sure you want to hear it? Don’t hit me.

“They asked…” Yan Shaoqing dragged his voice and looked like a hooligan. “They asked me if Sis-in-law has a partner. They said that if she doesn’t, they’d introduce her to someone.” As soon as Yan Shaoqing finished speaking, he felt Mo Yesi’s eyes turn cold.

He looked innocent. “Second Bro, I didn’t say that. Don’t be angry, I definitely told them that Sis-in-law is already taken. They didn’t give up at first, but when I said that Sis-in-law was married to you, no one said anything anymore.”

The two young masters of the Mo family were the best match.

There was no one better than them.

Hence, after knowing that Mo Yesi and Qiao Mianmian were married, no one dared to have any ideas.

Even if they felt that their son was outstanding, no one dared to say that they were better than Mo Yesi.

Mo Yesi glared at him. “What nonsense are you talking about? Tell them that Qiao Mianmian is my woman, don’t get any ideas.”

“Yes, yes, yes.” Yan Shaoqing couldn’t take it anymore. “Don’t worry, no one will dare to snatch Sis-in-law from you. Sis-in-law belongs to you alone.”

Mo Yesi ignored him and turned to look out of the private room.

Yan Shaoqing went forward and put his arm around his shoulder. “Second Bro, don’t think about Sis-in-law all day long. You two usually spend time together like conjoined twins. Can’t you let her be for a moment?

“Come on, let’s have a drink. We haven’t drunk together in a long time.”

Mo Yesi walked over.

Lin Wanwan’s gaze followed his figure wherever he went.

“Wanwan, what are you still standing there for? Come over and pour the wine for me.” Yan Shaoqing looked at Lin Wanwan, who was still standing at the same spot, smitten with Mo Yesi.

“Oh…” Lin Wanwan seemed to have just snapped out of her daze. She reached out to touch her burning cheeks and bit her lip as she walked over.

Mo Yesi sat on the sofa with his long legs crossed. The air conditioner in the room was on, but it still was a little hot. He reached out and unbuttoned his shirt.
