Chapter 919: Unidentified Object

Qiao Mianmian was still worried. She thought for a while, threw her cell phone aside, jumped off the bed, and ran out of the kitchen.

As she got closer, she could smell the pungent smoke.

She immediately pushed the door open, and a puff of white smoke hit her face, causing her to cough uncontrollably.

“Cough, cough, cough. Mo Yesi, what are you doing.” Qiao Mianmian coughed so hard that she was tearing up. She held her nose and blew the white smoke away as she walked in. When she saw the two black and unclear objects in the nonstick pot, she was stunned and asked with a twitch of her lips, “What’s in the pot?”

“Cough.” Mo Yesi choked too. He covered his mouth and coughed. He looked down at the two pieces of black stuff in the pot and kept quiet for a while before saying, “Steak.”

Qiao Mianmian asked, “... Steak?”

She couldn’t help but ask, “Are you sure?” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The two balls were so black that it was hard to tell what they were.

“Mm.” Mo Yesi also felt that his steak was a failure and looked a little unnatural. “This steak... I don’t know how it became like this. I made it according to the recipe, it shouldn’t be like this.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She wanted to laugh but held it in.

She recalled how Mo Yesi had confidently said that it wasn’t difficult to follow the recipe.

He could definitely do it.

But now... it was done. He just couldn’t eat it.

It seemed like a smart man like Mo Yesi didn’t know everything.

He could manage a company with tens of thousands of people well.

But in terms of culinary skills, he was obviously not talented.

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t surprised at all. In her opinion, it was already good enough that Mo Yesi didn’t set the kitchen on fire.

“There are still two pieces of steak left.” Mo Yesi kept quiet for a while before picking up two pieces of steak from the nonstick pan and throwing them into the trash can. “I’ll do it again. I’ve got experience this time, I’ll definitely be able to do it well.”

“Let me do it.” Qiao Mianmian sighed. “Go out and wait. Dinner will be ready in 40 minutes at most.”

“I’ve already said that I’ll be the one cooking today.” Mo Yesi furrowed his brows. “Believe me, I’m really experienced now. Wait for a while more, I’ll be done with the steak soon.

“It was just a mistake.”

He found an excuse for himself and refused to admit that his culinary skills were terrible.

What could possibly stump Mo Yesi?

As long as he wanted to do it, there was nothing he couldn’t do.

He didn’t believe it.

He had to make this meal today.

He wanted her to know that he would definitely do what he promised her.

“Baby, go out and wait a while more.” Mo Yesi took the pot and washed it in the sink. He looked as if he wouldn’t leave the kitchen until the steak was done. “In half an hour, no, at most 20 minutes, I’ll be done with the steak.

“Eat some snacks first. I’ll prepare it as soon as possible.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She didn’t want to dampen his enthusiasm.

But she was really worried that he would burn the kitchen down. She thought for a while and said tactfully, “Mo Yesi, why don’t we cook together?”
