Chapter 1591: Don’t Dare to Continue Thinking Anymore

Linda thought about what happened just now. Although she was a little afraid of Gong Zeli, she still gathered her courage and said, “Young Master Gong, thank you for what you did just now. If you hadn’t appeared in time to help Mianmian, the consequences would be unimaginable.”

Gong Zeli only looked away after Qiao Mianmian left.

He turned to look at Linda coldly. “There’s nothing to thank me for. But I don’t want to see this happen a second time. Since she’s your artiste, you have the responsibility to protect her.

“If I wasn’t there tonight, do you think you can bear the consequences?”

Linda was shocked.

The consequences...

She couldn’t afford it.

Hence, she was glad that she’d met Gong Zeli at such a crucial time and he prevented the terrible consequences.

“Young Master Gong is right.” Linda was a little afraid of Gong Zeli’s gaze. She looked down after a few seconds and didn’t dare to look at him again. “Mianmian is my artiste, I have the responsibility to be responsible for her safety. I really didn’t do well today, not going with her.

“I’ll be more careful in the future.”

Gong Zeli knew that Linda couldn’t be blamed for this.

Even if she was with Qiao Mianmian, it wouldn’t have stopped Boss Huang.

Thankfully, Qiao Mianmian was fine now.

He was just a little afraid when he thought about it, so he blamed it on Linda.

“Why were you guys going on the KTV tonight? How is it related to that Huang guy?”

Linda told Gong Zeli everything.

“I didn’t expect that Boss Huang was so lecherous. If Young Master Gong hadn’t appeared in time, Mianmian might have...”

Linda immediately stopped when she saw Gong Zeli’s darkened expression.

Because at that moment, she felt a terrifying murderous aura from him.

Linda looked at Gong Zeli’s scary expression and felt weird.

Actually, she already felt strange in the KTV.

When Gong Zeli saw that Qiao Mianmian was being bullied by Boss Huang, he seemed to have lost his mind and went forward to hit Boss Huang.

He was heavy-handed.

If Qiao Mianmian hadn’t stopped him, he might have really killed Boss Huang.

Linda knew that Gong Zeli and Mo Yesi were friends.

Hence, it was normal for him to help when his brother’s woman was being bullied.

But Gong Zeli’s help was different from a normal friend’s.

Her intuition told her that Gong Zeli treated Qiao Mianmian... differently.

Qiao Mianmian was fine, but she was sent to the hospital for a checkup.

This concern was beyond that of a normal friend.

Linda didn’t dare to think further.

She felt that Gong Zeli wasn’t so foolish. She was probably overthinking.

Perhaps... he was taking care of Qiao Mianmian only because he had a good relationship with Mo Yesi.

...

Qiao Mianmian was fine, to begin with, so she was naturally fine after the checkup.

She took the report from the doctor and walked out of the diagnosis room. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

When she reached the door, she bumped into someone.

Qiao Mianmian immediately apologized. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”

“It’s alright, I should be the one apologizing. Miss, I didn’t hurt you, did I?”
