Chapter 1872: Are You Still Dating Her?

At a private clubhouse.

The waiter who received Mo Shixiu kept sneaking glances at him. After she brought Mo Shixiu to a private room, she said respectfully, “Sir, Madam Mo is waiting for you inside.”

She knocked on the door and said to the person inside, “Madam Mo, Mr. Mo Shixiu is here.”

A voice came from inside. “Come in.”

The waiter opened the door.

Mo Shixiu walked in and was stunned when he saw an unfamiliar woman sitting beside Madam Mo.

“Shixiu, you’re here.” Madam Mo waved at him. “Come and take a seat. Xiao Ya and I have been waiting for you for a long time. Why did you take so long to come? Was there a traffic jam?”

Mo Shixiu stood at the door for a few seconds. He looked at the strange woman sitting beside Madam Mo and frowned. “Why is there someone else here?”

“This isn’t anyone else. This is Miss Tang Ya.” Madam Mo also glanced at Tang Ya sitting next to her, then turned back and said with a smile, “She’s a new friend of mine. Xiao Ya is traveling in Yun Cheng. We met at a cafe, and after chatting, we became friends because we hit it off very well.”

Mo Shixiu took another look at Tang Ya and said coldly, “I see. Hello, Miss Tang.”

“Hello, Mr. Mo.” Tang Ya’s eyes flickered. She stood up and extended a hand to him. “It’s nice to meet you. I’ve heard a lot about you from Madam Mo. Seeing is better than hearing a hundred times. As Madam Mo said, Mr. Mo is indeed an outstanding person.”

Mo Shixiu looked at Tang Ya’s outstretched hand, but he didn’t intend to shake it. He just nodded.

Tang Ya was stunned for a second, then withdrew her hand.

“Mom, why are you looking for me so urgently?” Mo Shixiu stood at the door and asked.

“Can’t I look for you for no reason? As a mother, I miss my son. Can’t I see him?” Madam Mo saw that he was still standing there and said unhappily, “Why are you still standing at the door? Come in quickly. Are you going to just stand there as I talk to you?”

Mo Shixiu hesitated for a moment before walking in.

Madam Mo took the menu on the table and handed it to Tang Ya. “Xiao Ya, take a look at what you like to eat. You must be hungry after waiting for so long.”

“Ma’am, you can order the dishes. I don’t have any dietary restrictions. I can eat anything.” Tang Ya pushed the menu back. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Shixiu and I don’t have any restrictions on food, so it’s better for you to order. The food here is different from foreign food, after all. You might not like what we order, so you can order what you like. After you’ve ordered, we’ll place our order.”

“I see... Alright, then. I won’t stand on ceremony.”

Tang Ya took the menu and flipped through it for a while before returning it to her.

Madam Mo took the menu and ordered a few dishes before passing it to Mo Shixiu.

Mo Shixiu did not take it. “I’m not hungry. Luoli and I have already eaten together.”

Hearing that he was with Jiang Luoli, Madam Mo’s expression changed.

“Were you with Jiang Luoli when I called you?”

Mo Shixiu looked straight at her. “Yes.”

Madam Mo’s expression turned even uglier. “Are you still dating her? Shixiu, if you find this kind of poor girl from a small family to be fresh and want to play with her, I won’t object to it. However, if she doesn’t know her own identity because of this and has any extravagant hopes because you treat her better, then there’s no need to keep her.”
