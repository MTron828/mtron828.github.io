Chapter 125: Bitter Sarcasm

“You...”

“Counselor.” Qiao Mianmian walked in slowly.

Bai Xiao and Zhang Yuwei glared at her.

Hatred and anger could be seen in their eyes.

Qiao Mianmian sighed quietly as she saw their expressions.

They had been roommates for three years and nothing had happened so far.

All of a sudden, they couldn’t even be friends any longer.

There was only half a year left, and most of it would be spent on internships and attachments outside of school.

Moreover, they would be moving into another room. It would be less awkward now that they didn’t have to face each other every day.

“They don’t have to apologize to us. Let’s close this case right here.” Qiao Mianmian didn’t bother getting an apology from them. It wouldn’t be sincere, anyway.

It didn’t matter the least.

“Student Qiao, are you saying you’ve forgiven them?”

Qiao Mianmian smiled. “I wouldn’t consider it forgiving. They don’t need it from me, anyway.”

“Then...”

“Let’s end things here.” Qiao Mianmian said, “If there’s nothing else, Luo Luo and I will get packing.”

“Alright, alright.” The counselor couldn’t wait for this to come to a close too.

He immediately nodded. “Then, let’s do it your way. Since you still have to pack your bags, I’ll get going first. Oh, right. Student Qiao, if there’s anything you need, feel free to come and look for me.”

Qiao Mianmian smiled politely. “Thank you, we’ll settle this on our own.”

“Alright, then. I’ll get going. Come to me if you need help and I’ll do what I can.”

“Sure. Thank you, Counselor.”

“No worries, this is my duty.”

...

When the counselor left, Qiao Mianmian got to packing her bags.

Jiang Luoli went over and helped her with it.

She didn’t have many belongings, so it would be pretty fast with another person’s help.

When they were done packing, they took their bags and luggage and were ready to leave.

“Haha.” A burst of weird laughter could be heard. “In this day and age, it seems better to find a capable man than to be capable ourselves. One could get to live in a mansion and sit in a luxury car without having to work hard for it at all. That’s more than most people could ever achieve in their lifetimes.”

“With a rich and powerful man, you don’t have to earn any money on your own and can even have your teachers and schoolmates bow down to you. No wonder any girl with some looks would go for this easy way out.”

“That’s right. She just has to open her legs to get what she wants.”

“It’s best she moves out. It’s hard to live in the same room as someone with such terrible values. It’d be bad if she influences us.”

“Haha, what are you worried about? Are you pretty like her? She’s born with an innocent look, the look that rich men like. To you, she has bad values. But to those rich guys, she’s pure and innocent.”

They sang the same tune of bitter sarcasm.

The jealousy in their voices was unmistakable.

But Qiao Mianmian had already walked out the door.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com
