Chapter 858: She Finally Smiled at Him

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The private room was full of crew members.

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t worried that someone would secretly take photos of her.

Hence, she raised her cup and smiled at him. “I also hope that our future cooperation will continue smoothly. Senior Tu, thank you for bringing me along so well today. I find it rather enjoyable to act with you.”

Tu Yilei looked at the smile on her face and was stunned for two seconds. He felt as if all the unhappiness he had felt the entire day had vanished.

She looked so good when she smiled.

She finally smiled at him.

She wasn’t as cold and distant as before.

He really hated that feeling.

She could keep a distance from him.

Even if they were just friends.

This way, they could at least interact in private.

But she wasn’t even willing to be an ordinary friend. That sort of alienation and coldness really made him feel terrible.

He never knew that liking someone felt like this.

It wasn’t sweetness, nor happiness...

It was heartache.

All his emotions were led by this person.

No matter how cold and distant she was towards him...

But when she smiled, he felt that the world was beautiful again.

In the world of love.

Those who weren’t loved were all so humble.

After the toast, Tu Yilei turned around and left.

The moment he went back, a few actresses immediately walked towards him with wine glasses.

He was the male lead.

And he was the most popular male artiste now, so naturally many people wanted to build a good relationship with him.

A while later, the waiter entered with a few boxes of strawberry yogurt.

Qiao Mianmian held the yogurt and took small sips from a corner. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Just as she was about to pick up the second yogurt, Bai Yusheng handed her a microphone. “Do you want to sing a song? What do you want to sing, I’ll get someone to order it for you.”

He was asking her, but before Qiao Mianmian could reply, he raised his brows and smiled. “You know how to sing ‘Three-inch Sorrow’?”

Qiao Mianmian nodded. “A little...”

This was a very popular song recently. Qiao Mianmian liked it after hearing it once, so she learned it before.

She basically knew how to sing it.

“Then, sing this song.”

Bai Yusheng didn’t ask for her opinion. He got someone to order the song and handed the microphone to her. “Feel free to come out, don’t be too restrained. What’s so fun about being alone?”

Qiao Mianmian took the microphone and realized that everyone was staring at her.

She pursed her lips and said a little embarrassedly, “I don’t sing very well. If it’s not nice, don’t mind it.”

Someone immediately said, “Miss Qiao, you’re too humble. Your voice must be amazing.”

“Yes, Miss Qiao’s voice must be really nice.”

“We’re waiting for Miss Qiao to cleanse our ears with her voice.”

They were full-on flattering Qiao Mianmian, their “cousin.”

Qiao Mianmian was embarrassed.

But she could feel how well Bai Yusheng’s “cousin” was treated.

Everyone was supporting her.

It seemed like these people really believed that she and Bai Yusheng were relatives.

Qiao Mianmian thought about it and felt that this was good too.
