Chapter 812: Perverted

Seeing that Mo Shixiu was looking at him expressionlessly, Assistant Xu immediately explained, “I’m not suspecting her. It’s just that everyone around you should be investigated properly. We’ve always done this before.”

He emphasized the last line.

He just wanted to tell Mo Shixiu that she couldn’t be special just because he slept with her. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He trusted him unconditionally.

He wasn’t like this in the past!

Mo Shixiu knew what he meant too. He stared at him expressionlessly for a while before replying calmly, “Mm, go ahead.”

Assistant Xu heaved a sigh of relief.

Thankfully, the minister was rational and didn’t become a pervert.

“Then, Sir Minister, I’ll...”

Mo Shixiu looked up and frowned. “She might be unwell from last night. Go look for her again.”

Assistant Xu was stunned. “Are you referring to the lady from last night? Why... am I looking for her?”

He had given her all the money she needed.

From now on, they would cut all ties and never interact with each other again!

Why would he still look for her?

“Mm. Find her and ask if she has anything else she wants.”

Assistant Xu was confused.

What did he mean?

He’d already given 50 million!!

And now he was asking if she wanted anything?

Was he trying to give her more momentum?

No way.

Did he really fall in love with her after just one night?

“Sir Minister... do you still want to compensate that lady?”

Mo Shixiu narrowed his cold eyes and kept quiet for a while before nodding. “I feel guilty. I’ll only feel less sorry if I give her more compensation.”

“But you’ve already given her 50 million yuan, Minister. That’s a lot of money, enough for an ordinary person to live comfortably for the rest of their lives. I don’t think there’s a need for any additional compensation.”

He felt that it wasn’t worth it to compensate such a materialistic woman!

He’d rather donate that money to the poor mountains.

“Just go if I tell you to.” Mo Shixiu glared at him coldly and said unhappily, “Why are you talking so much nonsense. You seem to have something against her?”

“... No.”

Assistant Xu quickly denied it. “I just feel that 50 million is more than enough. If you give her more compensation, she’ll feel that your money is easy to get. She’ll inevitably ask for too much.”

If it was anyone else, Assistant Xu wouldn’t be so worried.

But that woman...

She was so materialistic. If she were to ask for compensation, she would definitely ask for too much.

“What are you worried about?” Mo Shixiu pursed his lips and said coldly, “No matter how much she wants, I can give it to her. I hope she can get more. That way, I’ll feel better.”

Assistant Xu was speechless.

Oh no.

His Chief must have been tricked by that girl.

Why did it seem like he was possessed?

If he hadn’t heard it with his own ears, he wouldn’t have believed that such words came from his Minister.

He knew that he would be scammed, but he still wanted to do it?

He felt better after being tricked.

He couldn’t understand him.

He felt that last night... was too much.

“What are you waiting for? Hurry up.”
