Chapter 2960: You’re Too Much

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The old lady didn’t say anything else. “I don’t object to you leaving some money for your daughter, but I won’t allow you to help her with anything else. Tang Ya is now in the police station, and you’re not allowed to get her out.

“She almost hurt my precious great-grandchild. If she doesn’t receive some punishment, I won’t agree to it.”

Mo Yunchen kept a straight face and replied, “Yes, I got it.”

“If you have anything to say, you can say it now.” Mo Yunchen looked at Mo Shixiu and Mo Yesi. ‘What do you think about my decision?”

“Dad, I have no objections. You can allocate your money however you want.” Mo Yesi already had countless assets under his name. He never cared about how his elders allocated their assets, so he naturally had no objections to Mo Yunchen’s arrangements.

He didn’t really care if his share was there or not.

Even if Mo Yunchen gave all his wealth to Tang Ya, Mo Yesi wouldn’t think much of it.

He could earn his own money.

As for the elders’ assets, they were just icing on the cake.

“Thave no objections,” Mo Shixiu said. “You can allocate your assets however you want. You don’t have to ask us.”

“Alright. Since you don’t have any objections, this matter is settled.”

“Sister-in-law, what’s going on? Why did you and Big Brother divorce? Also, what Tang Ya, what daughter? Why does Big Brother suddenly have a daughter?” Second Madam looked at Madam Mo, who was crying silently, and pulled her arm anxiously. “Sister-in-law, say something. What’s going on

between you and Big Brother?”

“How could they divorce just like this? Could it be...” Second Madam suddenly looked angry. “Could it be that Big Brother has someone outside? That daughter of his is his illegitimate daughter with another woman?

“sister-in-law, did you divorce Big Brother because of this?”

Before Madam Mo could say anything, Second Madam was sure that she had guessed correctly. She turned around and questioned Mo Yunchen angrily. “Big Brother, how could you do this? You’re too much.”

Mo Yunchen pursed his lips and didn’t explain himself.

Second Madam was sure about it now.

She yelled at him. “Sister-in-law is gentle and virtuous. She gave birth to such outstanding sons for you. Big Brother, what else are you unsatisfied with? You actually want to fool around outside.

“And now youre even planning to give your illegitimate daughter a share of the assets. Have you thought about how Sister-in-law feels? Have you thought about how we feel? Big Brother, you...”

“Enough, stop talking. You don’t even know what happened, why are you blaming Big Brother?” Mo Xingshu interrupted her with a frown.

“Did I say something wrong?” Second Madam said indignantly. “If I did, why didn’t Big Brother defend himself? Sister-in-law is crying silently. If she hadn’t suffered so much, would she be like this?”

“Big Brother isn’t such a person.” Mo Xingshu was a little angry too. “Stop talking nonsense.”

“Since Big Brother didn’t do anything to let Sister-in-law down, why did they divorce? Could it be that Sister-in-law did something to let Big Brother down?”DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎
