Chapter 1093: I Can Disappear Before You

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“I’ve also said that I won’t pester you anymore, so you don’t have to avoid me on purpose. I like you. But, no matter how much I like you, I won’t pester you regardless of your wishes. Even if we can’t be a couple, we’re still classmates.

“Do you know? You’re so nice to everyone in class, but you’re so cold to me. I’ve wondered more than once if I did something wrong to make you hate me so much.

“Should I not have appeared in front of you and upset you?

“If you’re really annoyed with me, I won’t continue to pester you. I can transfer schools, Qiao Chen.”

After saying this, Shen Xin felt much more relaxed.

She really wanted to transfer schools.

She wanted to forget Qiao Chen...

However, how could she forget him when he was in front of her every day?

She wondered if she could forget him as long as she did not see him again.

If she transferred schools, if she was no longer in the same school as him, if they were no longer classmates.

In the future, they would almost never meet again.

It was just that this thought had surfaced in her mind before, and she had ultimately not made up her mind to do it. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

But now...

As long as he said that he didn’t like her and didn’t want to see her again, she could immediately go and settle the transfer procedures.

She could disappear right before his eyes.

Qiao Chen’s expression remained indifferent. When he heard that she wanted to transfer schools, his expression changed.

He pursed his lips and clenched his fists. After a while, he frowned and asked her, “Shen Xin, are you transferring schools?”

Qiao Chen couldn’t tell what he was feeling.

When he heard that Shen Xin wanted to transfer schools, his heart was in a mess. He couldn’t help but panic.

But he didn’t know what he was panicking about.

Shen Xin smiled, but her eyes were sad. “Qiao Chen, if you don’t want to see me, I can disappear from your sight.”

“I don’t...” Qiao Chen’s voice was a little dry. “I’ve said it before, I’ve never hated you. Shen Xin... you don’t have to be like this. If I make you feel uncomfortable and you don’t want to stay in the same class as me, I can go to another class.

“But you really don’t have to transfer schools.

“If you really want to transfer schools, then it’s my turn.” Qiao Chen looked at her and enunciated each word clearly. “I can transfer schools.”

Shen Xin was stunned and looked at him in shock.

Qiao Chen looked at her as well. Shen Xin couldn’t understand the emotions in his eyes. “So, Shen Xin, you don’t have to transfer schools. If one of us has to leave, that person should be me, not you.”

Shen Xin looked at him blankly. Her lips moved, but she didn’t say a word.

She wanted to say something, but she couldn’t.

“Second Miss.”

At this moment, a middle-aged man’s voice sounded from behind her. He said respectfully, “Second Miss, you should get in the car. You have to accompany Madam to the banquet later. We can’t delay any longer.”

Shen Xin took a deep look at Qiao Chen. With reddened eyes, she turned around and said to the chauffeur behind her, “Okay, let’s go.”

Then, she left with the chauffeur.

Qiao Chen watched as she got into the black Bentley and drove into the street before slowly looking away.

Shen Xin left.

However, Qiao Chen kept thinking about her red eyes.
