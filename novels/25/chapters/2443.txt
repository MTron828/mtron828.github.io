Chapter 2445: Untitled

“Alright, Mister.” This customer was obviously very rich and willing to spend money. Overjoyed, the employee said to Qiao Mianmian more respectfully, “Miss, please follow me. There are many suitable clothes here.”

The employee knew very well.

A customer like Mo Yesi only came once a month, and her sales were enough.

If she was lucky, it’d be enough to fill her yearly quota.

They had to be nice to such a big customer.

There was no one else in the store. The few shop assistants surrounded Qiao Mianmian and picked out five to six different styles of clothes before accompanying her to the fitting room.

Mo Yesi waited in the rest area. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

He wasn’t a patient person, much less when it came to shopping with women.

He shopped with Madam Mo twice, but he found an excuse to leave after half an hour.

He felt that shopping with women was the most boring and wasteful thing in the world.

He could handle a few documents with that time.

But Mo Yesi never complained about shopping with his wife.

Although he still felt bored, he was willing to do this.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t intend to buy clothes.

She bought a lot of things tonight, and there were so many clothes at home that she could change into one every day. But Mo Yesi felt that she spent too little and wanted her to spend more.

She thought that it was still early and her stomach was still full, so she took the clothes recommended by the shop assistants and went to the fitting room.

It had to be said, the employees of such luxury brands had good taste.

They picked out a few matching outfits for Qiao Mianmian. The designs were all pretty good and suited her.

Qiao Mianmian tried them out one by one, and the shop assistants were full of praises. They said that these clothes were tailored for her and that she looked super good in them.

Qiao Mianmian knew that they were saying that because they wanted to sell the clothes.

But the clothes were really nice.

Even Mo Yesi, who had always been picky, found it good.

“Do you like it?” Mo Yesi stood up and looked at the dress she was wearing. His eyes darkened as he walked behind her and tidied her messy hair. “This dress suits you very well.”

“Mm, not bad.” Qiao Mianmian didn’t lie to her conscience and say that she didn’t like it.

“Then, buy them all.” Mo Yesi took out a card from his wallet skillfully. Before Qiao Mianmian could respond, he handed it to the shop assistant. “The clothes she tried on just now, we’re buying them all.”
