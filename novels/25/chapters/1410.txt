Chapter 1411: I Don’t Need You to Decide for Me

The woman was stunned.

She recognized Shen Rou.

If Shen Rou had said this to her in the past, she wouldn’t have dared to say anything.

But thinking about the Shen family’s current situation, how could she take Shen Rou seriously?

She sneered at Shen Rou. “I was wondering who it was, so it’s Young Lady Shen. Why, when did Young Lady Shen become Young Master Gong’s spokesperson? Young Master Gong hasn’t even said anything, how do you know he doesn’t want my contact details? What’s Young Lady Shen’s relationship with Young Master Gong?”

Shen Rou had never been insulted like this before.

She said with a dark expression, “My relationship with Gong Zeli isn’t for an unrelated person like you to say. I said he doesn’t want it, so he doesn’t want it.”

The woman sneered again and looked at Gong Zeli provocatively. “Young Master Gong, is Miss Shen speaking the truth? Could it be that Young Master Gong and Miss Shen are dating? If that’s the case, I won’t disturb you.”

Gong Zeli looked at the woman coldly.

The woman was full of confidence and didn’t take Shen Rou’s words seriously.

But when she met Gong Zeli’s cold gaze, she panicked.

There were rumors in the circle that the Young Master of the Gong family liked Young Lady Shen.

But Shen Rou had been on so many blind dates recently, and she had never been with the Young Master of the Gong family. It was inevitable that people would think that the rumors were false.

The woman also thought so and didn’t take Shen Rou seriously.

Gong Zeli looked at her coldly and didn’t say anything.

This attitude puzzled the woman.

The woman’s expression changed. She thought that Gong Zeli was admitting to dating Shen Rou. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

She could ignore the Shen family now, but if Shen Rou was dating Gong Zeli and relying on the Gong family, she couldn’t afford to offend them.

“It seems like I guessed correctly.” The woman probed again.

Seeing that Gong Zeli was still silent, her expression changed again. She hurriedly said, “Sorry for disturbing you.” Then, she turned and left.

Seeing this, the other women turned around and left too.

Gong Zeli’s reaction caused Shen Rou’s eyes to light up. She looked at him and said, “Zeli, just now you...”

“Don’t overthink it. I’m just not interested in those women.”

Gong Zeli interrupted her immediately. “You don’t have to decide for me in the future.”

Shen Rou’s expression stiffened.

“Ahem. Let’s go in, don’t squeeze at the door. Oh, right. Where’s Ah Si? Why don’t I see him?” Yan Shaoqing quickly changed the topic.

Lu Rao was a little shocked.

He’d never seen Gong Zeli treat Shen Rou so coldly.

Yan Shaoqing said that they had been fighting for a while.

Their relationship was still so strained. He really didn’t know what happened.

It was obvious that Shen Rou was at fault.

It seemed like she wanted to reconcile with Gong Zeli, but he didn’t want to.

“Speak of the devil.” Lu Rao glanced at the familiar figure and smiled.

“It’s Ah Si and Sis-in-law. Wow, Sis-in-law is so beautiful tonight.” Yan Shaoqing also saw Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi. When his gaze landed on Qiao Mianmian, he almost couldn’t help but whistle.
