Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Wow, this is too much. Are you really taking revenge for Qiao Mianmian in Boss Huang’s company?”

“Hahaha, I’m relieved to see that Mianmian’s boyfriend is so protective of her.”

“Wow, I’m so envious. I thought I was reading a domineering CEO novel. I wish I had such a domineering and loving boyfriend.”

“So, has anyone found out Nameless’s identity? We seriously suspect that he’s the one who acquired the Su Corporation. If he can casually acquire a company, he must be very impressive.”

“Let me reveal a secret to everyone. Qiao Mianmian’s boyfriend is indeed extraordinary. Everyone knows about the Mo Family, right? I heard that he’s from a branch family of the Mo Family. His family is considered a pretty good branch.

“The Mo Family’s branch family? I think this information is plausible. If he’s from the Mo Family, we can understand why Young Master Yan and Young Master Gong know him. Wow, I’m so envious of Qiao Mianmian. Her boyfriend is handsome, rich, and comes from a rich family. He dotes on her so much. She must have saved the galaxy in her previous life.”

“I don’t know about anything else, but I know that no one would dare to do anything to Qiao Mianmian.”

“Boss Huang just flirted a little and the company was investigated immediately. Who else dares to go against the rules?” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Soon, because of the netizens’ heated discussion, Mo Yesi also went on trending.

#Nameless’s identity revealed

Mo Yesi instantly occupied three trending topics, even more than Qiao Mianmian.

The trending topics were all about his identity.

The most reliable explanation was that he was a relative of the Mo Family.

No one expected Mo Yesi to be the new Chairman of the Mo Corporation.

After all, many people had heard of that rumor.

Second Young Master Mo wasn’t interested in women.

He was never seen with a woman by his side.

Hence, no one thought of Mo Yesi’s identity as the Chairman of the Mo Corporation.

Moreover, to them, the members of the Mo Family’s branches were also very powerful.

“Mianmian, have you seen the hot searches on Weibo? They’re all speculating about your boyfriend’s true identity.” Nana liked to gossip, and she always scrolled through Weibo when she was free. Hence, she knew almost everything that happened on Weibo.

Qiao Mianmian nodded. “Mm, I saw it.”

She never thought that the netizens would be so curious about Mo Yesi’s identity.

They were so curious that just discussing his identity alone made three trending topics.

Actually, Nana was rather curious too. She gossiped for a while and then asked, “Mianmian, the Internet says that your boyfriend is from the Mo Family. Is that true? Of course, I’m just asking casually. If you find it inconvenient to answer, don’t bother about me.”

“It’s not inconvenient. The netizens are right,” Qiao Mianmian said.

“They guessed right? Then, your boyfriend is really from the Mo Family?” Nana widened her eyes.

Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and nodded.

Mo Yesi was indeed from the Mo Family.

Hence, this wasn’t wrong.

Nana was envious.

The Mo Family was indeed very powerful.

He was rich, handsome, and came from a prestigious family. Most importantly, he valued and pampered Qiao Mianmian.

Who wouldn’t want such a boyfriend?

But Nana felt that some things couldn’t be envied.
