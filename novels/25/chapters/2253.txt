Chapter 2256: She Looks Too Scary

As the female lead, how could she tolerate an extra stealing her limelight?

She glared at her. “Lie however I tell you to. You’re just a walk-on. Who gave you the right to make your own decisions?”

“Director, I request a replacement!” After hitting Qiao Anxin, Anna turned around and said to the director forcefully, “I hate this kind of woman who plays tricks. Facing her will affect my performance.”

Seeing that Anna was angry, the director agreed without hesitation. “Alright, I’ll replace her immediately. Anna, don’t be angry. She’s just an unimportant person. I’ll get someone to chase her away immediately.”

“Then do so,” Anna said with a dark expression. “I won’t be in a good mood if I have to look at her for even a second longer.”

“Alright, alright. I’ll chase her away immediately.” The director quickly comforted her. “Don’t be angry, don’t be angry.”

The director turned to the crew member beside him. “Take her away.”

“Yes, Director.”

Qiao Anxin rode on Anna and grabbed her hair.

She was so angry that her eyes were red. Coupled with her ferocious expression, everyone was shocked.

Because Qiao Anxin was like a lunatic!

She looked too scary.

The employee walked over and pushed Qiao Anxin away. “Did you hear that? What are you still standing here for? Get out!”

Qiao Anxin staggered backward and almost fell.

She looked up at Anna indignantly, looking like she wanted to skin her alive.

Anna was shocked by Qiao Anxin’s glare. She looked at her indignant expression and got even angrier.

She was just a newbie, how did she dare to look at her like that after being slapped?

Anna gave Qiao Anxin another slap. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Why, are you still not convinced? Who are you trying to put on that aggrieved look for? You’re just a walk-on actor, so what if I hit you? What else can you do to me?” Anna finally felt better seeing Qiao Anxin’s swollen cheeks and deformed face.

This slut actually wanted to seduce the director.

She didn’t even look at herself.

She was just a walk-on actor, and she was so scheming. What if she really ended up in the director’s bed?

Qiao Anxin was stunned.

When she realized what was going on, she looked up and saw Anna standing in front of her. She couldn’t take it anymore and pounced on her.

“If you dare hit me, I’ll kill you!”

Qiao Anxin had never suffered such grievances.

No one had treated her like this since she debuted.

But now, she’d been slapped twice.

At this point, she was so angry that she had lost all rationality.

She pounced on Anna and grabbed her by the neck. She then yelled, “You hit me, You hit me! I’m going to fight it out with you!”

This slut dared to hit her!

Qiao Anxin wanted to vent and couldn’t care less about the consequences.
