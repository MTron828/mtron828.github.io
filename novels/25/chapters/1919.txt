Chapter 1920: Is He Crazy?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

He was still a member of the younger generation.

Even if Mo Yesi didn’t do anything to her, Madam Gong was still scared out of her wits.

“Is he crazy?!” Madam Gong’s face was pale as she pressed a hand to her chest. Her lips were still trembling from the shock. She was both angry and afraid as she said, “He’s too impudent. Did you see that? How dare he be so impudent!

“This is Gong family, and I’m his elder. How can he treat his elders like this!

“I want to go to the Mo Family to ask Madam Mo and Old Madam Mo if this is how they bring up their children.”

Madam Gong was furious. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

She was humiliated in front of so many servants in her own home.

This would damage her dignity as the mistress of the Gong family.

In the future, what prestige would she have in front of the servants? A junior could bully her as he pleased.

The few maids standing in the hall looked at each other for a moment without saying anything.

They were also shocked just now.

When Mo Yesi lost his temper, no one dared to stop him.

Mo Yesi’s actions just now were indeed very rude and impudent. He didn’t care about the relationship between the Gong and Mo families at all.

However, everyone in the upper-class society knew that the second young master of the Mo Family was not someone to offend.

Their Young Master had a bad temper and was famous in Yun Cheng’s upper-class society and even the entire city.

The difference between the Second Young Master of the Mo Family and their Young Master was that he would not display his bad temper as their Young Master did. Whether or not he was angry, he seemed to have the same expression and did not show much emotion.

But that did not mean that he had no temper.

On the contrary, when a person who usually did not show his emotions got angry, he would be even scarier than a person with a bad temper.

He didn’t erupt easily, but once he did, it meant that he had already endured to the extreme.

It sounded like Madam Gong had done something to his wife, which was why she had made him angry.

From the looks of it, Second Young Master Mo was really protective of his wife and doted on her.

However...

When did Second Young Master Mo get married? Why did he suddenly have a wife?

No one had heard of this before.

Didn’t they say that Second Young Master Mo was not interested in women?

The maids looked at Madam Gong, who was so angry that she looked like she was going to faint at any moment, but they were all concerned about something else. Who exactly was Second Young Master Mo’s wife?

What kind of person was she to be able to make the Second Young Master of the Mo Family, who was rumored to be “not interested in women”, marry her?

How outstanding must she be in order to gain his favor?

After all, even the eldest daughter of the Shen family did not catch Second Young Master Mo’s eye.

The butler witnessed everything and realized the seriousness of the matter. He quickly called Gong Zeli.

“Young Master, please come back quickly. Just now, Second Young Master Mo came to look for Madam. He lost his temper and smashed everything in the house. Madam was quite frightened.”

...

Mo Yesi was still angry after leaving the Gong residence.

Having accompanied him, Wei Zheng was so scared that he didn’t even dare to breathe loudly.

He finally understood why President Mo was so angry.

It turned out that Madam Gong was the one who had instigated Young Madam to be almost... almost raped.

So, he felt that President Mo’s actions today were already very restrained.
