Chapter 1956: Heinous Criminal

“Sir is concerned about you. Now that you’re pregnant, you naturally can’t be as casual as before. Moreover, the food Sir doesn’t allow you to eat is mostly junk food. It isn’t good for you and the baby.”

“I know.” Jiang Luoli pursed her lips again. “I didn’t say that he’s bad. But, I eat bland food every day, and my mouth is about to become bland. I really don’t have much of an appetite.

“I really want to eat hotpot, barbecue, crayfish, spicy hotpot. Baby, I drool just thinking of the hotpot we often eat.” Jiang Luoli had a bitter expression on her face and looked like she had nothing to live for.

She finally had someone to talk to, and she couldn’t stop holding Qiao Mianmian’s hand.

“Do you know? I’ve asked the doctor. It’s not a problem to eat these types of food occasionally. But Mo Shixiu, that stubborn man, doesn’t allow me to eat them. He even told me that there are parasites in these things. It’s not good for me to eat them.

“But even if there are, they were killed by the high temperature. We ate so much before, but nothing happened.

“Not only does he not let me eat what I want to eat, but now, I don’t even have the freedom to go out and play. I’m a pitiful worm that has lost my freedom. If I had known this would happen, I wouldn’t have gotten pregnant with his child.”

Jiang Luoli listed Mo Yesi’s crimes one by one as if she was counting them.

In her description, Mo Shixiu seemed to have become a heinous criminal.

Qiao Mianmian laughed. “Brother is just worried about you. He’s worried about you because he’s responsible for you.”

“I know.” Jiang Luoli frowned. “But I really don’t have any freedom now. You don’t know how bored I am. He doesn’t have time to accompany me every day. Luckily, you’re back. You won’t be leaving soon, right?”

“I don’t know yet.” Qiao Mianmian shook her head. “My manager hasn’t informed me about my schedule yet. But I’ll be with you for the next few days in Yun Cheng, alright?”

“I do hope that you can spend more time with me. However, you and Prince Charming are separated more often than not. How can I selfishly occupy your time? Even if I want to keep you, Prince Charming will definitely not agree.

“Alright, alright. I’m already very happy to be able to see you now. If you’re free, you can come to visit me once in a while. I’m already very satisfied. Let’s not stand here. Let’s enter the house first.”

“Baby, this is a biscuit that I baked myself. Try it and see if it tastes good.”

Jiang Luoli took out a plate of freshly baked biscuits from the kitchen and handed it to Qiao Mianmian. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“You baked these yourself?” Qiao Mianmian was a little surprised when she saw the decent-looking biscuits.

After all, the Jiang Luoli she knew wouldn’t do such a thing.

“Yeah, I learned this from Sister Lin. Didn’t I tell you? I’ve been bored to death recently. Anyway, I don’t have anything to do at home every day, so I’m just wasting my time.”

Qiao Mianmian took one and tasted it. It actually tasted pretty good.

“How is it? Is it delicious?” Jiang Luoli sat down beside her.
