“They...”

Qiao Mianmian did not want to tell Mo Yesi the truth and wanted to make up an excuse.

But Jiang Luoli quickly said, “They got in a conflict with us and went back.”

Mo Yesi raised an eyebrow. “Conflict, what conflict?”

Qiao Mianmian did not have time to stop her, and Jiang Luoli told him everything that had happened so far.

After she finished, she asked angrily, “Male God, don’t you think they are too much? You gave them gifts and invited them to eat in such a nice place, but they actually felt that Mianmian was deliberately showing off! You were not present, but it was really unpleasant to see how jealous they were.”

Mo Yesi’s face was grave after listening to her.

He lowered his head and asked Qiao Mianmian, “Is what she said true?”

Qiao Mianmian gave Jiang Luoli a helpless look, sighed, and nodded.

She really did not want Mo Yesi to feel that there were so many weird things around her.

“Alas, when I think about how we still have to stay in the same room as them for another half a year, I feel helpless,” Jiang Luoli said bitterly.

“Just change rooms,” Mo Yesi said directly. “It’s simple. I’ll let people say something to the school. You can move to a new room tonight. Don’t live with anyone else, just the two of you in one room.”

“Wow, really? I have no objections!” Jiang Luoli danced with joy.

Anyway, since their relationship had already become so sour, she did not want to sleep with Bai Xiao anymore.

Moreover, two people living in one bedroom was simply perfect.

She heard that the double room was a suite room, and each person could have their own small room.

Just thinking about it was beautiful.

“Mianmian, let’s move. Let’s go to the double suite room. In the future, we can enjoy our own beautiful couple world.” Jiang Luoli was afraid that Qiao Mianmian would not agree, so she held her arm and shook it vigorously.

“Okay, let’s move.”

Qiao Mianmian also felt that if they continued staying in the same room with Bai Xiao, everyone would just be very unhappy.

In this way, it was better to just move out.

Anyway, her relationship with them had always been average, and this fake sisterhood was not necessary to maintain.

...

Leaving the banquet hall.

The sky outside had darkened.

Mo Yesi looked at the time, walked to his black Bentley, and said to Qiao Mianmian, “Come on, I will send you guys back to school. Since you want to move rooms, you should go back earlier.”

Hearing this, Qiao Mianmian froze for a moment, a look of surprise on her face. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“What’s wrong?” Mo Yesi looked at her with pursed lips.

She walked slowly to his side and stole a glance at Jiang Luoli, who was standing beside her, from the corner of her eye. She then lowered her voice and asked, “You want to send me and Luoluo back?”

“Is there a problem?”

“No...” Qiao Mianmian hesitated and whispered again, “I was a little surprised. Uncle Li told me before that you don’t give other women rides so casually. I thought...”

She thought he would not let Jiang Luoli get into his car.

If so, that would be a bit awkward.

Mo Yesi reached out and wrapped his arm around her waist, lowered his head to her ear, and gently blew into her ear with a low voice. “Yea, my car doesn’t carry other women casually. Except for my wife and relatives, no other woman has ever been in my car.”

“Then how...”

“She’s your good friend. Baby, for your sake, I’m willing to accommodate. For me, a little discomfort is far less important than you.”
