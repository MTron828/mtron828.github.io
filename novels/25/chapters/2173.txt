Chapter 2175: We’re Close?

“That’s good.” Bai Yusheng looked at the man with darkened eyes. He stood in front of Gu Sheng and blocked the man’s gaze.

He turned around and looked at him. “This gentleman is?”

“Young Master Bai, I’m Chen Jie, the general manager of Hongkai Enterprise.” The man looked at Gu Sheng and then at him. After hesitating for a few seconds, he asked, “I didn’t know that Young Master Bai and Miss Gu knew each other. Has Young Master Bai and Miss Gu worked together before?” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Bai Yusheng could tell that the man was testing him, and the coldness in his eyes deepened.

“Why, Gu Sheng didn’t tell you that we used to…”

“I know, Mr. Bai. But we’re not very familiar with each other.” Gu Sheng interrupted him. She walked out from behind him and looked at the man who had just spoken to her. “President Chen, didn’t you ask if I have time to eat with you? I should be free in a few days. Let’s pick a place to eat together.”

Bai Yusheng’s expression changed instantly.

President Chen was also surprised.

But after a few seconds, he was pleasantly surprised.

He looked at Gu Sheng happily and said excitedly, “Miss Gu, do you really have time?”

“Mm.” Gu Sheng didn’t look at Bai Yusheng. “I should be free.”

“That’s great. Then, Miss Gu, we…” The man was overwhelmed by the sudden joy. He was about to say that he would arrange a specific time when he suddenly felt a gust of cold air. It was so cold that he immediately had goosebumps.

The man turned around and saw Bai Yusheng looking at him warningly.

That look was murderous.

He was shocked speechless.

“I just said that Gu Sheng isn’t free.” Bai Yusheng lowered his voice. “Do you not understand?”

“No, Young Master Bai, I…” The man’s face was pale with fear.

“Mr. Bai, it’s up to me whether I’m free or not. Since when did Mr. Bai become my spokesperson?” Gu Sheng looked at Bai Yusheng angrily. “I don’t need Mr. Bai to decide things for me, right?

“Are we close?”

Bai Yusheng pursed his lips and slowly turned around.

He held back his anger and looked at her. He took a deep breath and smiled sinisterly. “We’re not close?”

But Gu Sheng’s expression was very calm as she nodded and said, “Mm, not familiar.”

“Say it again.” Bai Yusheng gritted his teeth. “Gu Sheng, are we really not close?”

“We’re not close.” Gu Sheng said calmly, “Mr. Bai, we just know each other. We’re not even very good friends. So please, don’t interfere in my matters anymore, and don’t pretend that we’re close in front of others.

“I don’t want anyone to misunderstand.”

“You don’t want others to misunderstand?” Bai Yusheng said through gritted teeth. “What do you mean?”

“Exactly what I said.” Gu Sheng finally felt that she had done well and regained some control. At least, the one angry now was Bai Yusheng, not her.

She was probably a bad person.

She actually felt good seeing Bai Yusheng so angry.
