Chapter 1568: He Told Me Several Times

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Shen Fei smiled. “Qiao Mianmian? So it’s you.”

Qiao Mianmian found it strange and blinked. “Senior Shen, you...”

“Qin Han told me about you.” Shen Fei didn’t hide it and was very direct. “He mentioned you to me a few times. I’m so curious about you. I finally met you in person today. You’re really a smart girl.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned again. “Brother Han mentioned me to you?”

“Mm.”

“Then, what did he say?”

“He praised you. I rarely see Old Qin praise someone like that. He said that you’re a junior he admires. He told me that you’re born to be an actress. You have high comprehension, and you’re talented in acting. Your future is limitless.

“He also said that if I work with you in the future, he’ll let me take care of you.”

Qiao Mianmian blushed.

Did Qin Han ever praise her like this?

She felt a little embarrassed.

“Brother Han really said that?”

“Of course.” Shen Fei chuckled. “Otherwise, would I have made this up?”

“Oh right, don’t ask Old Qin.” Shen Fei reached out and pulled Qiao Mianmian. “Old Qin is a thin-skinned person. If he knew that I told you this, he would definitely find trouble with me.

“He won’t tell me anything in the future.”

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but laugh. “Alright, I won’t tell him.”

“Then, promise me that you won’t tell him,” Shen Fei said as she complained about Qin Han. “Old Qin is especially arrogant. He doesn’t want others to know about it. But he really admires you. I rarely see him praise anyone like that.

“I believe that someone that Old Qin thinks highly of will definitely not be bad. So, you have to be more confident later. Don’t have any worries. Just perform well. Since Old Qin recommended you, he has confidence in you. You have to have confidence in yourself.

“Do you understand what I’m saying?”

Qiao Mianmian was a little shocked. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Was she not confident?

Shen Fei could tell.

But Shen Fei’s words helped her a lot. Qiao Mianmian was indeed a little nervous when she saw Shen Fei walk in.

She wasn’t confident enough.

Shen Fei’s words made her feel less stressed.

She never thought that Qin Han would have such a high opinion of her.

She thought that since Qin Han helped her so much, she had to perform well in today’s audition, whether she was chosen or not.

“Senior Shen, thank you,” Qiao Mianmian said sincerely. “Thank you for telling me so much. I’ll perform well.”

“You’re welcome.” Shen Fei smiled and said, “Old Qin and I have been friends for many years. I like the juniors he admires. I really hope you can be chosen. Anyway, all the best.”

Shen Fei cheered her on.

“Alright, this audition hall has become a place for you to make friends.” The director knew Shen Fei too, so he spoke casually. “If you have anything to say, say it in private later. Let’s start the official audition. It’s not Shen Fei’s first audition, so there’s no need to say anything to you.

“Xiao Lin, tell the newbie the rules.”
