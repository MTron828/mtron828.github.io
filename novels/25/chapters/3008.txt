“No.” Bai Yusheng said helplessly, “We didn’t have any conflicts. I just don’t think you should have high expectations. I don’t want to disappoint you again. Alright, the shoot is about to start. I’m hanging up. We can talk about it later.”

This time, Bai Yusheng hung up before Mother Bai could say anything.

He was really afraid that Mother Bai would lecture him for a long time.

Previously, Mother Bai had been rushing him, saying that his sister’s marriage problem had been resolved, but he still hadn’t made a move.

He was behind his sister in the marriage department.

Now that Qiao Mianmian was pregnant, Mother Bai must be even more anxious about his marriage.

If possible, he wanted to solve his personal problem as soon as possible.

But on Gu Sheng’s side… she definitely wouldn’t agree to it.

The conflict between them had just been resolved and their relationship had just improved. If he suddenly mentioned marriage, it might scare her away.

He cherished this lost relationship and was very careful.

He didn’t dare to take any more risks.

Bai Yusheng had just hung up when a staff member walked over and smiled. “Director Bai, your girlfriend is here to visit.”

A slender white figure walked out from behind him.

The woman was wearing a knee-length white floral dress. Her long hair was draped over her shoulders, and she had a gentle smile on her beautiful face. Holding a bouquet of flowers, she handed it to Bai Yusheng with a smile.

“Director Bai, congratulations on finishing your new show.”

Bai Yusheng was stunned for a few seconds before he smiled and took the flowers. “Thank you. Miss Gu, you’re so polite?”

As he spoke, he walked to Gu Sheng’s side and wrapped his other arm around her waist, leading her to the shade.

“It’s so hot, why didn’t you tell me you were here beforehand?”

“I wanted to give you a surprise and do a sudden check.” Gu Sheng smiled slightly and felt the curious gazes around her. She pursed her lips and tidied her hair in embarrassment.

“Sudden check?” Bai Yusheng turned his head and smiled gently. “You’re so worried about me?”

“Of course!” Gu Sheng looked into his deep and gentle eyes and playfully winked. “Who doesn’t know that Director Bai is the man all the female artistes in the entertainment industry want to sleep with? He has so many romantic rivals, how can I not watch him closely?”

“Oh? Then, you’re welcome to check on me at any time.” Bai Yusheng chuckled and pinched her cheek. “This situation has lasted for years, but no female artiste has been able to sleep with me. Do you know why?”

“Why?” Gu Sheng asked cooperatively.

Bai Yusheng smiled and looked at her deeply. “You’re asking the obvious. I only sleep with one person. Do you want to ask who this is?” Gu Sheng blushed.

She punched his chest twice and said, “You’re not serious.”

Bai Yusheng grabbed her soft hand. “Mm, only

you.”

When the people around saw this scene, they smiled and whispered, “Director Bai and his girlfriend have such a good relationship.”

“Director Bai’s girlfriend is pretty. She has a good temperament. I heard she’s a rather famous artist.”
