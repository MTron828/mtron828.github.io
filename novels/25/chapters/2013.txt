Chapter 2016: The Lesson Was Too Light

“Chairman Mo, I brought Qingqing here this time because I wanted her to apologize to your wife. Chairman Mo, Qingqing is young and insensible. I’ve already punished her previously. I’ll punish her properly when we get back. Chairman Mo and Young Madam Mo, please be magnanimous and forgive her this time.”

Mo Yesi looked at him coldly. “Young and insensible? So she can insult my wife?”

“No, Chairman Mo…”

“Shangguan Hua, you’d better take good care of your daughter. Otherwise, someone will help you discipline her. If it was someone else, she probably wouldn’t be standing here safe and sound.” Mo Yesi glanced at Shangguan Qing.

His gaze made Shangguan Qing feel as if she had been thrown into a pool of ice. Coldness seeped into her bones, and she couldn’t help but tremble. Fear emerged uncontrollably.

Shangguan Hua was also frozen by this gaze.

“Chairman Mo, what do you mean?”

Mo Yesi glanced at him coldly and then instructed Uncle Zhang. “Uncle Zhang, what are you still standing there for? Didn’t you hear what Young Madam said just now?”

“Mr. Shangguan, Miss Shangguan, please.” Uncle Zhang was no longer as polite as before. He gestured for them to follow him.

It was no different from chasing them out.

“Chairman Mo…”

“Mr. Shangguan, please.” Uncle Zhang didn’t give him another chance to speak. Just as he said the word “please”, bodyguards walked in and pincered Shangguan Hua and Shangguan Qing.

The situation was obvious.

If they refused to leave, the bodyguards would chase them away.

Even if Shangguan Hua was unwilling to leave, he couldn’t ignore his pride and let the Mo family’s bodyguards chase him out.

“Chairman Mo, Young Madam Mo, I know you’re still angry. I’ll definitely get Qingqing to apologize to Young Madam Mo someday.”

With that, Shangguan Hua grabbed Shangguan Qing’s arm and said, “Qingqing, let’s go.”

“But Dad…” Shangguan Qing looked at Qiao Mianmian in shock. She couldn’t understand why a lowly actress would suddenly become the Second Young Madam of the Mo family.

“Let’s go!”

Shangguan Hua grabbed her arm and dragged her away. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

A moment later, the hall returned to silence.

“Old Madam, have some tea to cool down.” Uncle Zhang took a cup of tea from a housemaid and handed it to Old Madam. He said slowly, “Don’t let anger consume you because of such a person. It’s not worth it.

“I’ll go and lecture the people downstairs later. I won’t let them in anymore.”

Old Madam took the teacup and sipped it. As she listened to Uncle Zhang’s gentle persuasion, she slowly calmed down.

But she was still angry. “Who does the Shangguan girl think she is? How dare she bully my granddaughter-in-law? Does she think the Mo family is easy to bully?”

“Grandma, don’t be angry. I’ve already taught them a lesson.”

Mo Yesi narrowed his eyes. “But the lesson was too light.”

Qiao Mianmian’s heart warmed when she saw how angry Old Madam became and how protective Old Madam was of her.

She thought that Old Madam would suspect her and Gong Zeli after hearing what Shangguan Qing said.
