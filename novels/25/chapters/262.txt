Chapter 264: She Will Not Back Off

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Her grandson was married and had a wife.

She didn’t think it was good if Shen Rou continued liking her grandson.

Thus, the Old Madam had said this in a roundabout way. Now that Mo Yesi was a married man, she should avoid suspicion.

Shen Rou was clever and naturally understood her meaning.

Her expression changed several times after hearing this.

Old Madam had persuaded her with good intentions.

But to Shen Rou, her words stung.

She couldn’t listen to a single word.

She didn’t think the Old Madam was doing her good. On the contrary, she felt like the Old Madam was too biased.

They all knew that she had grown up with Mo Yesi and had all thought she would marry him in the future.

Everyone thought they would be the best match.

So why should she back off now?

Just because Mo Yesi was now married?

But Madam Mo had said herself that divorce was possible.

Nothing was eternal.

Furthermore, she didn’t think Mo Yesi and Qiao Mianmian’s marriage would last long.

They were from two different worlds, so how many common topics could they possibly share?

Even if their relationship was good now, it was just a momentary sense of freshness.

How many days could it last after this freshness?

Thus, she would not back off. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

She could wait.

She believed that they would divorce in a year at most.

But it was only a year, so she could afford to wait.

“Grandma Mo, I understand.” Shen Rou appeared obedient and sensible on the surface, even though her mind was thinking the opposite. “I understand what you mean. Don’t worry, Ah Si is already married. I’ll know my limits and won’t bother him and Mianmian.”

“Good girl,” the Old Madam said in relief. “I knew you were sensible.”

...

After sending the Old Madam back to her room, Shen Rou went downstairs.

She saw a maid approaching with a bowl of black water on the way.

Glancing at it casually, she asked out of curiosity, “What’s this? Where are you bringing it to?”

Shen Rou frequented the Mo family’s house.

Before Mo Yesi’s marriage, the servants of the Mo family basically regarded her as the future Young Madam.

Even if Mo Yesi was now married, they were still polite to her.

Although she wasn’t the Young Madam, she was still Young Lady Shen.

Thus, the maid immediately replied respectfully, “Miss Shen, this is brown sugar water.”

“Brown sugar water?” Shen Rou was startled. “What is it for?”

“The Young Master told us to boil it when he brought Young Madam back. This should be for Young Madam.” The maid smiled and didn’t notice Shen Rou’s face fall. “This can help relieve menstrual pain for girls.”

“Yes,” the other maid said with a smile. “I really didn’t know that our Young Master is such a caring and considerate person. He’s really good to the Young Madam. Not only did he tell us to make the brown sugar water in advance, but he also ordered the kitchen to cook lighter food. It must be because the Young Madam is having her period and can’t eat spicy food.

“I thought the Young Master wasn’t the kind to be gentle with women, but I even saw him carry the Young Madam up the stairs in his arms and lean in close to whisper to her. He gazes at the Young Madam with such tender eyes.”
