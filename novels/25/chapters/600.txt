Chapter 601: Answer me, Mianmian

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Yes, Chairman Mo.”

When Wei Zheng left, he shot Qiao Mianmian a worrying look.

Chairman Mo seemed very angry.

He hoped that they wouldn’t end up in a heated argument.

But given the news that Young Madam got into with her ex, it was only natural that Chairman Mo got angry.

Any other man would feel the same if they were in his position.

Especially since Chairman Mo cared so much about Young Madam.

If he was in Chairman Mo’s position now, he wouldn’t be able to take it.

He would probably make the Su Mandate bankrupt already.

This Su Ze was really asking for it though.

Chairman Mo was already angered the last time when he sent Young Madam flowers.

Now he was actually proposing to Young Madam in public?

He was courting death.

Chairman Mo was surely furious this time.

Although Chairman Mo seemed rather expressionless when he informed him of this news and did not blow up...

He knew full well after all these years that the quieter Chairman Mo was initially, the bigger the eruption would be thereafter.

Su Ze was definitely going down this time.

Wei Zheng closed the door lightly when he left.

Then, Mo Yesi used his finger to gesture for Qiao Mianmian to come nearer.

He seemed so scary and unapproachable, and even colder than usual.

Qiao Mianmian dared not get closer to him.

She was stunned in her spot for a few seconds.

And in these few seconds, the man’s eyes got even colder.

The air around him got stale and thick.

It was so suffocating, Qiao Mianmian almost wanted to flee the office.

Seeing how she wasn’t moving towards him, Mo Yesi reached out and pulled her into his arms.

Qiao Mianmian let out a short “Ah!” and then landed with her head against his chest. He then forced her into sitting on his lap.

Before she even looked up at him, he asked, “Where did you go today? What were you doing before you came?”

The man sounded rather calm, but his voice was laced with a hint of danger.

Qiao Mianmian detected it and tried to break free from his grip. “Mo Yesi, let go of me.”

The man’s arms were like bars of steel, keeping her in place.

He was using so much force, she felt as if her back could break.

She was getting uncomfortable.

“Baby, you haven’t replied to me.” Mo Yesi pinched her chin and tipped her head up until their eyes met. “Where were you before you came to the Mo Corporation? What were you doing?”

“Mo Yesi.”

He wasn’t using a lot of force, but it was already hurting Qiao Mianmian pretty badly. Her eyes were red, and she bit her lip as she glared at him teary-eyed. “Let go, you’re hurting me.”

Mo Yesi seemed to snap out of it when he saw her bloodshot eyes. Much of his anger immediately dissipated. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He released his grip around her waist as well, but he wasn’t letting go of her just yet.

“Answer me, Mianmian.” The man wasn’t going to let this off. “Where were you before this?”

“Mo Yesi, did you see some news about me?”

Qiao Mianmian eyed him and just made a guess.
