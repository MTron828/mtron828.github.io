With that, he narrowed his eyes and turned to look at Shangguan Qing, who was still clenching her teeth on the ground. “Take her away, too.”

Hearing that, the security officers immediately went to drag the girl off the ground.

When the security guard reached out to grab her, Shangguan Qing’s reaction was especially intense. She waved the security guard’s hand away and yelled, “I’m Shangguan Qing, the daughter of the Shangguan Family. Get lost, don’t touch me.

“Whoever dares to touch me, I’ll make sure you suffer.”

The security officers were stunned by her actions.

They were employees of the Gong Corporation and had naturally heard about the Gong Family’s marriage with the Shangguan Family.

And they saw Shangguan Qing with Gong Zeli before.

They really didn’t dare to touch this woman who might become their future lady boss.

The security guard looked at Gong Zeli as if asking for his opinion.

Gong Zeli said angrily, “Don’t you understand me? Take her away.”

“But Miss Shangguan...”

Gong Zeli sneered. “It seems like you’d rather be fired.”

“No, no, Young Master Gong. We’ll bring Miss Shangguan away immediately.”

They would be fired if they didn’t follow the order. The security officers didn’t hesitate anymore and reached out again. Ignoring Shangguan Qing’s struggle and resistance, they pulled her up from the ground.

“Brother Zeli, I’m not leaving.

“Let go of me, get lost, don’t touch me.

“Brother Zeli...

“Gong Zeli, you’re too much. I’m going to tell Aunt Gong everything you’ve done!”

Shangguan Qing was escorted further and further away by the security officers. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Until they couldn’t hear her anymore.

The crowd was also dispersed by the security officers.

But some people were unwilling to leave and looked over from afar.

Qiao Mianmian wanted to stand up on her own.

But when she tried to move, her ankle immediately hurt. The unbearable pain made her unable to stand up.

She tried a few more times, and her face turned pale from the pain.

Jiang Luoli noticed her abnormality and squatted down. She looked at her injured leg and asked anxiously, “Baby, what’s wrong with your leg? Is it injured?”

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian took a deep breath and endured the pain. “I think I sprained my ankle. I can’t stand up.”

“What? Sprained your ankle?” Jiang Luoli frowned. “Then, we have to go to the hospital quickly.”

Qiao Mianmian looked at her lap and sighed. “But I can’t stand up now.”

Jiang Luoli immediately said, “I’ll carry you.”

“You?” Qiao Mianmian looked up at her. “Can you do it?”

Although Jiang Luoli was 1.7 meters tall, her figure was slim.

Jiang Luoli was about to speak when she heard a voice above her head. “I’ll carry her.”

Jiang Luoli and Qiao Mianmian looked up at the same time.

Both of them were stunned.

Gong Zeli squatted down and faced Qiao Mianmian. “Get your friend to help you up. The hospital is nearby, I’ll drive you there.”

Jiang Luoli turned to look at Qiao Mianmian and then at Gong Zeli.
