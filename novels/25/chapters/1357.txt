Chapter 1359: You Really Don’t Care About Your Reputation?

Qiao Mianmian would definitely beg her to change her mind.

No one wanted a bad reputation.

The more famous one was, the more they cared about their reputation.

She only did it because she knew that Qiao Mianmian was a public figure and she valued her reputation.

But she didn’t expect her to not care.

She didn’t even call her.

Things were developing differently from what she expected. This made Lin Huizhen lose confidence.

“That slut must have done it on purpose. She’s playing mind games with us.” Lin Huizhen clenched her teeth. “How could she not care? She must have seen the news.

“She deliberately didn’t call and pretended not to care. She must know that I’m waiting for her call.”

“Then, what do we do now?” Qiao Anxin was furious. “What if she really doesn’t care? Now she has the Bai and Mo families backing her up, and Qin Han is standing up for her. Soon, the netizens won’t take what you said seriously.

“But we offended her because of this. She definitely won’t let us off easily.”

“Anxin, don’t be anxious. The little slut can’t possibly not care. Everything Mom did was for your own good. I can’t possibly harm you. I’ll give her a call now and find out what she’s thinking.”

...

On set.

The entire crew knew about Qiao Mianmian, and so did Bai Yusheng.

During the intermission, he found Qiao Mianmian. “Do you need me to settle it for you?”

“Brother, I can settle it myself.” Qiao Mianmian declined his kindness. “I want to settle this myself, alright?”

Bai Yusheng nodded. “Alright, I won’t interfere. You can settle it yourself. But if you can’t solve it, don’t force yourself. We’re family. You’re my sister. If you have something to say to your brother, there’s nothing to be embarrassed about.”

“Mm, I know. If I need your help, I’ll definitely let you know.”

Bai Yusheng respected Qiao Mianmian’s wishes and let her settle it herself.

Lin Huizhen was waiting for Qiao Mianmian’s call.

Qiao Mianmian was also waiting for her call.

She was sure that Lin Huizhen would call her.

Just as she guessed, a few hours later, Lin Huizhen finally couldn’t take it anymore and called her.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t save Lin Huizhen’s number. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

But the moment her cell phone rang and she saw the unknown number on the screen, she immediately guessed that it must be Lin Huizhen.

Qiao Mianmian pressed the recording button.

“Qiao Mianmian, you really can hold it in. Why, do you really not care that your reputation will be ruined? Or do you think that my news isn’t enough to ruin your reputation?”

Lin Huizhen’s angry voice could be heard the moment the call connected.

Qiao Mianmian kept quiet for a while. Lin Huizhen couldn’t see that she was smiling. “I was wondering why this number looked a little familiar. So, it’s Aunt Lin’s cell phone number. Aunt Lin is so angry. Who angered you?”

“Stop pretending!”

Lin Huizhen got even angrier. “Qiao Mianmian, you’ve seen the news. I’m sure you know that public opinion is on my side now. If you still want to continue in the entertainment industry and care about your reputation, be smart.”
