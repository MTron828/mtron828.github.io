Chapter 369: Are You Sure You’ve Never Been in a Relationship Before?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

She usually enjoyed shopping.

In fact, she and Jiang Luoli went out shopping a lot during the weekends.

But she was with Mo Yesi today.

And men detested shopping.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t want to put him through that.

She decided she could shop with Jiang Luoli another time instead.

Mo Yesi was slightly stunned.

Didn’t Wei Zheng say that women loved shopping?

Why didn’t she seem interested at all?

He kept quiet for a while as his brow was raised. “You really don’t want to buy anything? If you do, I’ll accompany you.”

“I...”

“Didn’t you say that you owe Jiang Luoli a huge thank-you for this audition?” Mo Yesi found another reason. “She helped you out, shouldn’t you get her a gift in return? We can go shopping and pick a gift for her.”

Qiao Mianmian looked a little surprised. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Mo Yesi noticed it. “What’s wrong?”

She shook her head. “Nothing much. I just didn’t expect you to be so thoughtful. It didn’t even occur to me to do this, but you thought of it.

“You’re right, Luo Luo did me a huge favor. I should get her a gift to thank her.

“But... are you sure you want to follow me?”

Mo Yesi nodded. “Mm. What’s the problem?”

“There’s no problem.” Qiao Mianmian looked at him. “I’m just afraid you’d find it boring. Don’t you men dislike shopping?”

Mo Yesi said, “Mm. I don’t enjoy shopping. But it also depends on the company.”

That man looked at her alluringly. “Nothing is boring when I’m doing it with the person I love.”

Qiao Mianmian’s heart started racing when she heard that.

Her sweet face turned a little red.

At that moment, she could hear the loud thumping of her heart against her ribs.

Could Mo Yesi...

Be less flirtatious.

Had he secretly read the whole collection of romance novels, or what?

Why had he become so glib?

Was this really coming from a man who claimed to never have dated before?

He was doing so much better than other men who’d actually been in relationships before. If he had a bit more experience... wouldn’t every woman fall prey to him?

Well, at least she’d fallen for it.

She couldn’t resist his handsome face and sweet words.

“Mo Yesi.” She took a gulp and asked, “Are you sure you’ve never been in a relationship before?”

Mo Yesi seemed taken aback. “I’m sure. Why?”

Qiao Mianmian looked at him. “Then, how do you manage to say all the right things? You don’t seem like someone who’s never had experience in this.”

Rather, he seemed very experienced in picking up women.

“So, Baby...”

Mo Yesi chuckled, shaking her further. “Did my words manage to hit the right spots for you?”

Qiao Mianmian looked up at him, and her heart pumped even faster.

With his looks and that smile...

Was he trying to captivate her?

Well... if he was, he’d succeeded.
