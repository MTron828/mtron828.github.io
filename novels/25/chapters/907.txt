Chapter 908: It Seems Like a Conflict

He wasn’t as polite when he was with Sister Lin.

Jiang Luoli rolled her eyes at him and turned away, too lazy to look at him.

Assistant Xu’s expression darkened.

He wanted to flare up but couldn’t.

In the end, he could only suppress his anger.

Sister Lin looked at their interaction, and her eyes flickered. Although she had some doubts, she couldn’t ask them now.

It seemed like she had to ask Assistant Xu about it later.

What was going on between him and Miss Jiang?

It seemed like a conflict.

However, Assistant Xu had always been very gentlemanly towards women. It was rare to see him having conflicts with any woman.

Moreover, this woman had an extraordinary relationship with Sir.

By right, Assistant Xu shouldn’t be treating her this way.

Could Miss Jiang have done something to make Assistant Xu angry?

Although she wasn’t 100% accurate, she was at least 80% sure.

She sized her up just now. This girl didn’t seem like someone with a strange temper.

She was really pretty.

Her skin was fair and her figure was curvy.

Just based on her looks, she was worthy of Sir.

There weren’t many good-tempered girls.

They always liked to throw a tantrum because of their looks.

But she could tell that this girl wasn’t the type to make a scene just because she was pretty.

Women were usually able to see through other women.

At her age, it was even rarer for her to mistake a person’s temperament.

Assistant Xu and Sister Lin walked in front.

Sister Lin was afraid that she would feel uncomfortable, so she asked, “Miss Jiang, how old are you this year? Are you studying in Yuncheng City? Is your family in Yuncheng City too?”

Jiang Luoli answered her every question.

Upon hearing that she was studying at Yuncheng City Film Academy, Sister Lin couldn’t help but exclaim, “So Miss Jiang is studying at the Film Academy. No wonder Miss Jiang is so beautiful. Does Miss Jiang want to be an actress in the future?”

Jiang Luoli shook her head. “I want to be a director, not an actress. I want to make movies in the future.”

“Director?” Sister Lin was a little surprised. “I thought Miss Jiang wanted to be an actress. Girls rarely become directors, right? I think all the directors are guys.”

Jiang Luoli smiled. “Mm, there aren’t many female directors.”

“That shouldn’t be easy. I don’t know much about directors and actors, but since very few girls do this, it must not be easy. Miss Jiang, you’re amazing.”

Jiang Luoli was embarrassed by the compliment. “No, I only have such thoughts now. I don’t know what will happen in the future.”

“That’s already very impressive,” Sister Lin said sincerely. “It’s definitely harder to be a director than an actress. Many girls will definitely choose to enter the entertainment industry to film when they grow up to be like you. You have such good qualities, but you want to film a movie or something.”

“But it’s not easy to make a movie.” Jiang Luoli thought for a while and said, “I don’t know if I can persevere.”

“Take your time, you’re still young.” Sister Lin sounded more approachable now.
