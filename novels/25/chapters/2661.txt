Chapter 2663: The Doctor Couldn’t Explain

“Then, do you want Sister to continue crying?” Shen Xin didn’t argue with her.

Stunned, Madam Shen fell silent.

Shen Xin didn’t look at her anymore. Instead, she held Shen Rou’s hand and coaxed her as if she was coaxing a child. “Sister, let’s go find Brother Yesi, alright?”

“Good, good!” Shen Rou was so excited that she danced. It was a stark contrast to her crying self.

“Brother Yesi, let’s go look for Brother Yesi!” She looked at Mo Yesi impatiently.

Beside Mo Yesi, Qiao Mianmian was still shocked.

She knew that Shen Rou was sick.

She also heard from Yan Shaoqing that Shen Rou’s IQ was only that of a three- or four-year-old child.

But hearing and seeing were two different things.

Hearing it wasn’t as shocking as seeing it with her own eyes.

This was the first time Qiao Mianmian saw her after Shen Rou’s accident.

She knew that Shen Rou must have changed a lot, but Qiao Mianmian was still a little shocked when she saw how silly she looked.

Shen Rou was really different.

Looking at her beautiful face, Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but sigh as she thought of the proud and arrogant Young Lady Shen who didn’t care about anyone except Mo Yesi.

If Shen Rou wasn’t so obsessed with Mo Yesi, she wouldn’t have caused so much trouble for him.

Perhaps she wouldn’t have ended up in such a pathetic state.

She was thinking that if there was medicine for regret in this world, would Shen Rou regret everything she’d done? Would she want to take the medicine? Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

But there weren’t so many ifs.

It was impossible to change what had already happened.

While Qiao Mianmian was deep in thought, Shen Xin held Shen Rou’s hand and walked towards them.

Even if Shen Rou was already a fool and no different from a child, Mo Yesi was still on guard. He tightened his arm around Qiao Mianmian’s waist and hugged her protectively.

“Brother Yesi, I’m sorry. Sister wants to see you. She’s very stubborn now. If we don’t do what she wants, she can cry for the whole day. So…” Shen Xin said apologetically.

As it was Shen Xin who brought Shen Rou over this time, Mo Yesi’s expression softened a little. He glanced at her and said calmly, “Didn’t you say she lost all her memories? Why does she still remember me?”

“Mm, she lost all her memories. In the beginning, she didn’t even know us, nor did she know who she was,” Shen Xin said bitterly. “Actually, she still doesn’t remember us. The doctor said that there’s a clot in her brain. The reason she lost her memories should be related to that clot.

“Because that part can’t be operated on, we can only wait for the blood clot to disperse on its own. If we’re lucky, it can slowly disperse. If we’re unlucky, it might never disperse in this lifetime.

“But Sister does remember you. She keeps saying that she wants to look for you.

“We’ve asked the doctor about it, but he couldn’t explain it.”

Just as Shen Xin finished speaking, Shen Rou called out excitedly, “Brother Yesi, Brother Yesi..”
