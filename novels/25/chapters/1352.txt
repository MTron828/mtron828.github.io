“I can’t take this lying down if I don’t expose her.

“I want to expose her and let everyone see her true colors!

“I really didn’t expect the child I raised from a young age to be like this. She doesn’t even care about her family for fame and fortune. Is fame really that important?” Lin Huizhen cried until her eyes were swollen.

Qiao Mianmian had a thought after watching the video.

Lin Huizhen’s acting was really good. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

If this wasn’t her stepmother and she was just a passerby, she might have believed it after watching this video.

It turned out that many people believed Lin Huizhen.

The haters who had been eyeing Qiao Mianmian didn’t miss this opportunity.

Qiao Mianmian was scolded badly.

Her latest Weibo comment, private messages, and trending topics were all scolding her.

She was getting criticized again.

Nana was watching the video with her.

Seeing Lin Huizhen’s interview, she was furious again. “This woman is too shameless. The netizens believe her now and are scolding you. Mianmian, you have to clarify things quickly and let the netizens know the truth.”

Qiao Mianmian was the one being scolded by the whole internet, but she was rather calm.

She quietly turned off the video.

Qiao Mianmian knew that Lin Huizhen was up to something when she left in anger.

She was already mentally prepared.

In the past, Lin Huizhen was able to live peacefully with her because she was always the one being bullied by Lin Huizhen and Qiao Anxin.

She wouldn’t affect them.

Lin Huizhen naturally wouldn’t do anything to her.

But now, Qiao Anxin was banned.

After being banned, it meant that Qiao Anxin’s source of income was gone.

This was unacceptable to both her and Lin Huizhen.

This involved the interests of both mother and daughter, so Lin Huizhen naturally wouldn’t be at peace with her.

She was desperate.

What she said in the interview was true, but she only said the parts that were beneficial to her.

When Qiao Mianmian was young, Lin Huizhen sent her to the hospital once.

But that was not long after Lin Huizhen arrived.

She did that to gain Father Qiao’s favor.

After her status in the Qiao family stabilized, she didn’t do these things anymore.

As for the time she brought her thugs back to the Qiao family...

Qiao Mianmian pursed her lips. She only reposted the post that Qin Han spoke up for her.

She then exited Weibo.

Nana watched as she did that. Seeing that she had no intention of clarifying it, she couldn’t help but feel anxious.

“Mianmian, aren’t you going to clarify things?” She was furious when she saw the video. She didn’t believe that Qiao Mianmian wouldn’t feel anything.

She’d been slandered like that, and now she was being scolded by the entire internet.

How could she still be so calm!

“I’ll definitely clarify it,” Qiao Mianmian said calmly. “But I haven’t gathered enough evidence to prove that she’s lying. Just based on what I say, the netizens definitely won’t believe me.”
