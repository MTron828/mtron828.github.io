Chapter 1926: A Large Sum of Money Poured Into the Shen Corporation

She bit her lip and glared at him. “Hmph, indecent.”

In the video, the man chuckled. “How am I indecent?”

Qiao Mianmian glared at him again. “You know.”

“Hm?” The handsome man raised his eyebrows. “If you don’t tell me, I really won’t know.”

Qiao Mianmian felt that this man was just playing dumb!

He knew what she was referring to!

Knock knock!

Suddenly, there was a knock on the door and Shen Fei’s voice rang out. “Mianmian, are you inside? We’re going out. Are you ready?”

“Sister Shen, I’m here. I’ll be right out.”

Qiao Mianmian quickly responded.

Then, she said to Mo Yesi, “The production team has prepared dinner tonight. I have to meet up with everyone. Remember, you have to eat well. Send me a photo when you go for dinner later and I’ll see what you’re eating tonight.”

Was she still very trusting of Mo Yesi? Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

She was afraid that he would lie to her.

Mo Yesi smiled gently. “Okay.”

“I’ll hang up, then.” Qiao Mianmian was about to hang up.

“Wait.”

“Is there anything else?”

“Well, you forgot something.”

Qiao Mianmian blinked. “I forgot something? What is it?”

Mo Yesi looked at her with his dark eyes and said seductively, “Baby, you forgot to call me Hubby.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“Call me Hubby before hanging up.”

“...”

Mo Yesi then waited quietly.

Qiao Mianmian looked at him for a few seconds and couldn’t help but laugh. “Alright, hubby, hubby, hubby, hubby. Are you satisfied now? Can I hang up now?”

In the video, the man chuckled softly, his eyes filled with affection. “En, go eat. I’ll call you later.”

...

On the other side.

Mo Yesi had just hung up when Wei Zheng walked into the office with a stack of documents.

“President Mo, this is the information we just gathered today.”

He handed the printed document to Mo Yesi, thought for a while, and said, “According to the information we found, there’s indeed a force supporting the Shen Corporation. Three days ago, a large sum of money was injected into it. This money is very helpful to the Shen Corporation. It directly saved them from bankruptcy.

“This sum of money did not come from any company in Yun Cheng, but from overseas.

“But strangely, we can’t find out who the investor is.”

Mo Yesi took the document and flipped through it for a few minutes before placing it on the table.

The man frowned. “You can’t find the investor behind this?”

“Yes.” Wei Zheng also frowned and said, “We have tried many ways to investigate, but we just can’t find anything. It feels like the other party knew that someone would investigate, so they did a good job of keeping it a secret so that we don’t know where to start.”

Over the past few days, something big had happened.

Everyone in the industry was discussing this matter.

The Shen Corporation, which was bound to go bankrupt, suddenly received a large investment.

This investment brought the Shen family back to life.

Everyone in the industry was guessing who the investor was.

Other than the Mo, Gong, and Yan families, there was no one else.
