Soon, Uncle Zhang helped Old Madam upstairs.

Only Madam Mo and the housemaids were left in the living room.

Madam Mo was still sitting in her original seat with an awful expression.

She didn’t think she was wrong.

On the contrary, she felt aggrieved.

She was devoted to her two sons, but both of them were unhappy with her because of women.

Madam Mo felt especially upset.

No one could understand her..

Upstairs.

Mo Yesi was afraid that Qiao Mianmian would be unhappy, so he immediately comforted his wife after closing the door.

“Mianmian, don’t take Mom’s words seriously.” Mo Yesi sighed and said gently, “She doesn’t know you, so she suspected you after seeing those rumors. But Grandma and I believe you.”

“I actually don’t care about this.” Qiao Mianmian smiled and hugged him. “As long as my husband trusts me.”

“Of course I believe you. Don’t I know what kind of person my wife is?”

Mo Yesi lowered his head and kissed her forehead. “If a couple doesn’t even have this bit of trust between them, what’s the point?

“Do you want to rest for a while? I’ll call you at dinner.”

Qiao Mianmian slept in the Bai Residence, so she wasn’t sleepy now.

She shook her head. “I’m not tired. I’ll read the script for a while. Sister Xie sent me the script for the movie. I was too busy to read it.”

Knock, knock, knock.

Someone knocked on the door.

Mo Yesi looked up and heard the housemaid say, “Second Young Master, Old Madam wants you to go to her room.”

Mo Yesi was stunned.

A few seconds later, he turned to Qiao Mianmian and said, “Then, read the script. I’ll go to Grandma’s.”

“Alright.”

…

“Grandma, are you looking for me?”

Mo Yesi entered the Old Madam’s room and saw her watering the flowers by the window.

The few pots of orchids on the window sill were all raised by Old Madam herself. They were blooming now, and there was a faint fragrance of orchids in the room.

Mo Yesi walked in. Old Madam was still watering the flowers calmly, not saying anything.

Mo Yesi wasn’t in a hurry. He stood at the side and watched as Old Madam watered the flowers.

He even praised her. “Grandma, these orchids are really well taken care of.”

“It’s all because I have nothing to do. I can grow them meticulously with so much time on my hands.”

“Not necessarily.”

Mo Yesi didn’t suck up to others.

But he would still flatter his wife and grandmother sometimes.

He smiled and said, “Some people raise them meticulously, but they aren’t so good-looking. It’s not easy to raise the orchids so well.”

After watering the flowers, Old Madam turned around slowly and looked at her grandson. She smiled and asked, “Why aren’t you asking me why I called for you?”

“Because Grandma will say it when you want to.”

“You brat…”

Old Madam extended her hand and Mo Yesi helped her to the sofa.

“You’re so smart, you must have guessed why I’m looking for you. Then, I won’t beat around the bush. Ah Si, what’s going on between you and that brat from the Gong family? Why did things turn out this way?

“I think there must be a reason. Although you said it’s out of business considerations, the Mo Corporation has never encountered anything that needs to be canceled since we started working together. Grandma doesn’t believe you’re using this reason to patronize me.”
