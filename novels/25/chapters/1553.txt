Chapter 1554: Jiang Luoli, What Do You Mean?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Isn’t that so? Do you think this person is normal? Xiao Hai is young, how could he resist temptation? Anyway, Xiao Hai was harmed by that person. Now that Xiao Hai has been detained at the police station and hasn’t returned the money, they won’t let him out. But 10 million, how can we return it?

“Even if we lose our lives, we won’t be able to return this sum.

“So, Ah Li, you’re the only one in our family who has the hope to return the money for your brother.”

Jiang Luoli felt that something was amiss.

But she was amused by Mother Jiang’s words.

“Mom, you’re talking about 10 million, not 10,000. If you don’t think you can pay it back, why do you think I can?”

Jiang Luoli had 10 million yuan.

She still had the 50 million that Mo Shixiu gave her.

But that didn’t mean she was willing to return the 10 million yuan for Jiang Hai.

Even if Jiang Hai was cheated, he was the one who couldn’t resist the temptation and had to gamble.

If this happened once, it would happen again.

Mother Jiang’s expression changed. “Jiang Luoli, what do you mean? Are you going to watch your brother be detained at the police station and not save him? He’s your biological brother, do you want to watch him die?”

Jiang Luoli’s eyes were calm. “Mom, you know that it’s 10 million yuan. Where do you think I can find 10 million yuan to pay it back?”

“Why can’t you find it?” Mother Jiang was anxious. “Other celebrities earn tens of millions of yuan each. Even if you don’t have that much, you can’t be too bad. You earn money the fastest as actors.”

Father Jiang was a little anxious too. “Ah Li, you can’t ignore your brother. You know that your mom and I are getting fixed salaries. We only have so little money every year. 10 million yuan is something we can never earn in our lifetimes. If you don’t help, what will happen to your brother?

“You used to be close. Can you bear to see him being locked up?” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Jiang Luoli found it funny. “Dad, Mom, it’s true that there’s a lot of money in the industry. It’s also true that it’s easier to earn money as an actress than ordinary people. But I’m just a student now. How much do you think I can earn without any fame?

“Not to mention 10 million, even if you ask me to take out a million, I won’t be able to.” Jiang Luoli’s parents’ expressions changed.

Mother Jiang’s expression darkened. “Jiang Luoli, don’t think I don’t know that you’ve earned a lot of money over the years. Even if it’s not 10 million, it’s at least a few million. Now that your brother is in trouble, you’re a member of the Jiang family. You have the obligation to help him.

“Even if you can’t take out 10 million yuan, you have to at least help him pay back his debt first and get him out of jail.”

“Mom, I’ve said it before. I don’t have that much money.” Jiang Luoli looked at Mother Jiang calmly and said, “Before Xiao Hai accepted the 10 million yuan, he should have thought of his inability to repay it. But he still took the money.

“Whether someone set him up or not, he’s not innocent.

“This isn’t the first time Xiao Hai has gambled. If you hadn’t pampered him, would he have become like this? Because of your indulgence, this happened. You can’t do anything, and I also can’t do anything.”
