Chapter 102: Who Wants to Envy You

“Since things have turned so ugly, I don’t think there’s a need to have this meal anymore.” Zhang Yuwei stood up and said coldly, “Qiao Mianmian, Bai Xiao is right, we aren’t dying to have this meal. You had a luxury car to send us around and even gave us branded skincare products. And then you planned for this dinner at this high-end restaurant, just so that you could treat us to a meal? Simple as that?”

Qiao Mianmian did not say a thing the whole time.

But when she heard this, she looked up at them expressionlessly.

Her eyes were cold and her attitude was completely different from before. “Oh? Is it? Then tell me, what exactly am I treating you to this meal for?”

Zhang Yuwei was stunned for a while when she saw how cold her gaze was. She frowned even more and scoffed. “You really want us to say it? Well, you’re just doing this to boast about your charm. You’re just trying to show off that the men you date are all rich and handsome!

“Look, the moment Su Ze broke up with you, you went for a better man right away. You must be feeling so smug about how all the best men in the world are up for you to pick from.

“You’re giving us these little treats and tokens so that we’d fawn over you, isn’t it? Or do you want us to envy you for having a handsome and rich boyfriend who happens to be so generous towards you?”

“Exactly.” Bai Xiao chimed in mockingly. “You made it so high-profile as if you’re afraid that no one knows you’re dating a rich man. So what if you got the most outstanding man in the world? What has that got to do with us? There are so many rich men on earth, who wants to envy you?”

Their words got more and more bitter as they sang the same tune.

At this point, all their inner thoughts were spilled.

Qiao Mianmian was shocked at first, but when she saw the jealousy in their eyes, she just found it all too ironic and pathetic.

Roommates for three years.

Even if they weren’t exactly close, they had been getting along well.

She hadn’t expected that Mo Yesi’s appearance would destroy three years of harmony with her roommates.

He had only appeared in school twice, and that was enough for her roommates to eye her with hatred.

Women were terrible.

Honestly, Qiao Mianmian would think that men like Mo Yesi were terrible too.

“You guys are too much.” Jiang Luoli had a look of disbelief on her face. “How could you talk about Mianmian like this? She isn’t the sort of person you make her out to be! So what if she’s found herself a handsome and rich boyfriend? If you aren’t happy about it, you can find one yourself! You think that she’s boasting and flaunting simply because your hearts are full of jealousy!

“Mianmian, just look at them. You take them to be friends, but they don’t feel the same.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Jiang Luoli and Qiao Mianmian were as close as sisters.

Hearing them insult Qiao Mianmian like that had Jiang Luoli feel as if she was the one being attacked.

Now she truly understood how scary it was when women were jealous.

Bai Xiao and Zhang Yuwei always seemed nice and peaceful. Who would have known that they were such people?

“Jiang Luoli, don’t you talk rot.” Bai Xiao mocked. “You love fawning all over her, but we’re not like you.”
