Chapter 2594: Kneel and Apologize to Her

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

But was she really going to back out just like that?

Was she really going to give up all her hard work?

No, she was indignant.

“Sister Aisha, I don’t want to leave the entertainment industry. Help me, help me.” Little Xiao suddenly cried. “If I leave the entertainment industry, I’ll have nothing. Sister Aisha, I beg you, can you help me? I can’t leave the entertainment industry.

“Help me. On account of our many years of friendship, can you help me again? If you don’t help me, I can’t find anyone else. Besides you, I really can’t find anyone else to help me.

“I know, Sister Aisha. You love me. You won’t leave me in the lurch.”

Little Xiao fell on the sofa and cried.

“There’s one last way.” On the other side, Aisha finally spoke after a moment of silence.

“What way? As long as I don’t have to leave the entertainment industry, I can do anything.” Little Xiao suddenly looked up, her face showing ecstasy.

“If you find Qiao Mianmian and apologize to her in person, she might let you off.”

“What? You want me to kneel down and apologize to Qiao Mianmian?” Little Xiao’s expression turned extremely ugly as she yelled in disbelief.

“Even if you kneel and apologize, she might not forgive you. I’m just saying that she might forgive you if you do this. This is the only solution I can think of. It’s all up to you.

“Is your dignity or your career and future more important? Choose.”

Aisha hung up after saying that.

Little Xiao was still holding the phone, her face full of anger and humiliation.

Asking her to kneel down and apologize to Qiao Mianmian?

She would never do that.

She hated that slut.

She would never kneel to that slut.

Getting her to apologize to Qiao Mianmian on Weibo was already her limit.

Make her kneel?

She would never kneel.

Just as the netizens thought that Little Xiao’s matter was over, they didn’t expect the second wave of news about her to be unexpectedly exposed.

And compared to the first round of news, this time’s news was more interesting and exciting.

It satisfied the netizens’ gossipy souls.

First, an entertainment gossip account named “Entertainment Not Closing” suddenly posted a Weibo with an eye-catching title.

[Shocking! The jade girl Little Xiao turned into a lustful girl, and many indecent photos were exposed.]

Then, it was a long post.

This entertainment gossip account had a lot of followers, more than 10 million.

Once this post was posted, a group of excited netizens rushed in.

The netizens ate the freshly released melon with gusto. They expressed that it was rather exciting and interesting. Some reposted it, some commented on it, and many of their friends ate it together.

“Oh my, what did I see? It’s simply blinding. I didn’t expect Little Xiao to have such an open side. It seems like I really can’t judge a book by its cover in the future. Who would have thought that someone who debuted as a pure and innocent girl would be so open in private?”

“If I’m not wrong, she slept with several famous directors. And Little Xiao has been in their shows. So, this is how she did things?”

“No wonder Little Xiao’s resources weren’t good at first. She suddenly obtained a lot of good resources from a certain time period. I thought that the company was willing to groom her. I didn’t expect it, I didn’t expect it. I was too naive.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com
