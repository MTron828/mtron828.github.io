Chapter 577: No Dating Within Three Years of Signing the Contract

Linda pondered for a bit, smiled, and slowly came back to her senses.

She walked towards Qiao Mianmian with her high heels making “click-clack” sounds.

“What a coincidence,” Linda said, brushing her curls. Standing in front of Qiao Mianmian, she said gleefully, “We actually reached at the same time.”

Qiao Mianmian followed suit. “Yes, indeed. Shall we head up together?”

“Sure.”

Although Linda had a lot of questions, she controlled her urge to gossip and pretended to be ignorant even though she was curious.

...

At the cafe.

They ordered a cup of coffee each. As they did not like to beat around the bush, they went straight to discussing the contract.

Linda handed over the printed contract to Qiao Mianmian and said, “This is the contract. Please look through it and, if there are no additional questions, we can proceed to sign.”

“Sure.”

Qiao Mianmian started reading the contract page by page.

The waiter served the coffees, and Linda took a sip. Seeing Qiao Mianmian still reading the first page, she did not rush her and said, “Take your time.”

“I feel that the company is very sincere. But if there’s anything that you’re unsatisfied with, or if you have any doubts, please feel free to tell me.”

“Mm.” This was Qiao Mianmian’s first agency contract since she entered the entertainment scene two years ago. She definitely had to read carefully.

After a few minutes, she noted that the conditions stated on the contract were pretty good.

As a newcomer, she was very fortunate to have such benefits stated in the contract. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

She also didn’t know why Linda had so much trust and confidence in her.

It was as if she thought she would definitely become famous.

If not, she wouldn’t have offered these benefits.

Despite not having signed with an agency previously, Qiao Mianmian knew that with her current status, she would never get such a favorable contract.

Though she hadn’t experienced it personally, she had some understanding of the entertainment industry.

The entertainment industry had a few types of contracts.

Based on the artiste’s fame and potential, they would sign the corresponding contract grade of either A, B, C, D, or F.

Normally, Qiao Mianmian would have been given the lowest-end contract given her current status.

When she gained popularity, she could then upgrade to better contracts.

But Linda...

Immediately gave her the grade A contract.

This contract was just one grade lower than the top-tier artistes.

Linda was taking a big risk.

If she was still unable to become popular with these extensive resources, Linda might not be able to continue at Huan Yu.

Half an hour later.

Qiao Mianmian went through the contract word by word.

She felt that Linda was taking a very big risk after reading the entire contract.

This contract was even better than she had imagined.

It was very sincere.

“Have you finished reading?” Linda asked, sipping her coffee as Qiao Mianmian placed the contract on the table. “What do you think? Is there anything that we have to amend?”

Qiao Mianmian shook her head.

“No, the conditions stated are very good. I’m very satisfied with it.”

“Then...”

“But...” Qiao Mianmian hesitated before speaking, “In the contract, it was stated that we are not allowed to date within three years of signing the contract. Is that correct?”
