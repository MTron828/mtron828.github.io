Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“No.” Mo Yesi cut her off. “No one can force me to do something I’m unwilling to do. This is my choice.”

“So you like her, then?” The lady seemed shaken. “Don’t you have issues being in physical contact with women? Your problem is cured?”

“She’s an exception.” Mo Yesi rubbed his temple as he watched the girl emerge from the bathroom with his hairdryer. “I can touch her.”

“So you married her because of this?”

“Yes, but not entirely.”

“Ah Si... marriage isn’t child’s play. You shouldn’t have so simply...”

“Alright.” Mo Yesi was getting a little frustrated. His voice went a little cold as he said, “I know how to handle my matters. What else do you have to talk about?”

She kept silent for a few seconds before saying, “I’m returning tomorrow. I’ll arrive in Yuncheng City at about 10:30 in the morning, can you come and fetch me?”

Qiao Mianmian brought the hairdryer to Mo Yesi.

She had just plugged it into a power source when he pulled her in again.

She sat on his lap, his arm around her waist. “I’ve got an important meeting tomorrow morning. I’ll get Yan Third and Fourth Bro to pick you up.”

“What meeting is it that’s so important? More important than me?” She was evidently upset. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Shen Rou, you’re not a kid anymore. Don’t be willful.”

“Hmph, so if your wife returns from overseas, you wouldn’t be there to pick her up?”

Wife?

Mo Yesi looked at the adorable young girl in his arms and couldn’t help but smile. “Of course not. If it was her, I’d put everything down at once to pick her up.”

There was no response.

A few seconds later, the woman said, “Ah Si, is she that good?”

Mo Yesi simply acknowledged. “Mm.”

“Alright, forget about picking me up. You’ll have time for the welcome banquet at night, right? Bring your new wife along, how about that? We had a deal back then to introduce our significant others to the rest so we can all get to know one another.”

“I’ll ask her.” Mo Yesi put his phone away from him and asked the girl, “Shen Rou will be back tomorrow. Yan Third and the rest prepared a welcome party for her tomorrow night. Do you want to come with me?

“They want to see you.”

The following day would be the weekend.

Qiao Mianmian was actually free tomorrow night.

She thought for a bit and said, “Would it be inappropriate if I went along? Would I affect you guys?”

“There’s nothing inappropriate. They’re all my long-time friends and are curious about the woman I married. Mianmian, you married me, you’ve got to try to accept me and integrate into my life and social circle.

“I want to introduce you to my friends sooner.”

Qiao Mianmian kept quiet for a few seconds and then nodded. “Alright, then. I’ll go.”

Mo Yesi was giving her recognition by doing this.

He was taking her as his wife, and that was why he wanted to introduce her to his best buddies.

If she rejected him, he would surely be upset.

The man smiled and stroked her hair upon seeing her response. He then replied to the woman on the phone, “I’ll bring her along tomorrow night. You people better be more restrained so you don’t scare her. If that’s all, I’ll hang up then.”
