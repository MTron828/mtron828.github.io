Chapter 1601: Miss, Who Are You Looking For?

In other words, he didn’t see Qiao Mianmian being bullied by Boss Huang, but a girl.

He would definitely help.

Now that this was mentioned, the ambiguous relationship between Qiao Mianmian and Gong Zeli was exposed.

Gong Zeli’s deliberate hurtful comments were also reversed.

At the same time.

A large number of netizens flooded the official Weibo account of the agency that Boss Huang was managing and scolded him.

“Your boss is a pervert, do you know that?”

“Hurry up and close your lousy company. Don’t let your boss continue to harm girls.”

“Is Boss Huang dead today? If not, I’ll ask tomorrow.”

“Your boss is dead meat. Do you know who Mianmian’s backing is? Your lousy company is going bankrupt.”

On Qiao Mianmian’s Weibo, many fans were commenting about her.

“Mianmian, are you alright now? It was really thrilling last night. Thankfully, Young Master Gong appeared in time.”

“Mianmian must be scared. (Hug), our fans will always be with you.”

“Where’s your boyfriend? Come to Mianmian’s side now and comfort her.”

Qiao Mianmian heaved a sigh of relief when she saw that the public opinion was getting better.

No wonder the Gong Corporation was able to turn the tables around.

“You met Boss Huang at the KTV last night?”

Qiao Mianmian turned around and saw Bai Yusheng.

His expression wasn’t too good. “You were bullied at the KTV? Why didn’t you tell me?”

Bai Yusheng was also in this industry.

Of course, he knew what kind of person Boss Huang was.

Hence, when he found out that Qiao Mianmian was bullied by Boss Huang, he was furious.

Qiao Mianmian kept her cell phone. “I think the matter has been resolved. I didn’t want to make you worry. Brother, don’t worry. I’m fine now.”

Bai Yusheng’s expression was still a little cold. “That old thing actually dared to bully you. I won’t let him off.”

Qiao Mianmian kept quiet.

She suddenly recalled Mo Yesi telling her that Bai Yusheng was especially good at controlling the stock market.

He was the one who caused the Shen Corporation’s stock price to plummet.

It was also because of that incident that the Shen family was unable to recover.

Now, he said that he wouldn’t let Boss Huang off.

The news of Boss Huang’s company’s stock price plummeting would probably spread in a few days.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t stop her brother from standing up for her.

She couldn’t.

If Gong Zeli hadn’t appeared in time last night, she didn’t want to think what would have happened.

...

Gong Corporation building.

Shangguan Qing was wearing a red mini-skirt and 10-centimeter heels as she got out of a red Ferrari with a lunch box in her hand.

She carried the lunch box and walked into the Imperial Palace Building. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

At the front desk.

The few employees at the front desk saw that she was dressed well and asked politely, “Miss, who are you looking for?”

“I’m looking for Brother Zeli. Is he in the office?” Shangguan Qing sized up the girls at the front desk and frowned, feeling a little uncomfortable.

Why did all the female employees in Brother Ze Li’s company look like foxes?

They didn’t look like well-behaved women.

She had to tell Brother Zeli to change these restless women.
