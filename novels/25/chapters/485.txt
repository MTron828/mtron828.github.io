Chapter 486: All Along, There Was Only Sis-In-Law

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

He bit on his lip and remained silent. His handsome face frowned even more.

“Damn, I was right?” Yan Shaoqing asked shockingly.

His Second Bro was silent!

He was silent!

No man would keep silent over such matters.

Especially a man like his Second Bro. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

This matter had to do with a man’s pride. If he wasn’t correct, his Second Bro wouldn’t be silent for so long.

Feeling that his reputation was tarnished already, he no longer cared about it anymore.

He took a deep breath, mustered up all his courage, and said, “It wasn’t like this the previous night as well. But today... it only lasted for 10 minutes, and she looked as though she despised me.

“What do you think caused it?”

Yan Shaoqing replied, “That night? Second Bro, are you referring to the night you lost your virginity? Could it be that having a different partner caused it? Because you loved her so much, you became so excited and couldn’t control yourself...

“And you didn’t have any feelings towards the woman that night. That’s why...”

Mo Yesi interrupted coldly. “All along, there was only Sis-in-law.”

Yan Shaoqing was shocked and could only respond after a while. “What do you mean, Second Bro? Are you trying to say that... the woman from that night is Sis-in-law?”

“Yes.”

He was shocked.

Mo Yesi never mentioned this to him before.

That was why Yan Shaoqing was so surprised.

But after his initial shock, he could understand why.

His Second Bro wasn’t such a loose guy.

He should have thought that Sis-in-law was the woman from that night.

Second Bro would never touch another woman after he was settled with one.

“But, the person that we arranged for you that night wasn’t Sis-in-law. The person that we arranged had an accident and was at the hospital. How did... Sis-in-law appear in your room? Did another person arrange it for you?

“Now that you mentioned it, it’s lucky that the woman we arranged for you was in an accident. She would have met Sis-in-law if that wasn’t the case. That wouldn’t be a pleasant scenario.”

Mo Yesi took a deep breath and continued, “Third Yan, I didn’t call you to discuss this matter.”

“Second Bro, are you angry?” Yan Shaoqing changed his tone as he noticed that Mo Yesi sounded angry. “Fine, let’s change the topic. Let’s talk about the timing for doing it, then?”

Mo Yesi was speechless.

If Yan Shaoqing was standing in front of him, he would have punched him already.

“Second Bro, if the woman that night was Sis-in-law, what do you have to worry about? You already said that you performed well that night already. This shows that you don’t have any problems. Maybe your body isn’t well this time?

“Have you been ill recently?”

Mo Yesi froze and frowned. He replied, “No.”

“You must be tired, then.”

“That’s a no, too.”

“Could it be that you’re too stressed from work?”

“I’m not stressed from work.”

Yan Shaoqing conceded. “That can’t be.”

Mo Yesi bit his lip and rubbed his head. He was really annoyed.

He knew that his performance shouldn’t be so bad.

If not, he wouldn’t have called Yan Shaoqing at all.

He thought that with his experience, he could help him figure out what was wrong.
