Chapter 1133: Become Her Chess Piece

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“The Bai family should be finding out soon. Before that, we have to confirm something.”

Qiao Anxin was still in shock. She clenched her fists. “Confirm what?”

Shen Rou said coldly, “Confirm if she’s really the daughter of the Bai family.”

“How can I be sure?”

“I’ll arrange this.”

“Then, what does Miss Shen need me to do for you?”

“What I want you to do is very simple. It’s absolutely beneficial to you.” Shen Rou’s eyes showed a hint of unwillingness. She paused for a few seconds before continuing, “Once we confirm that Qiao Mianmian is the Bai family’s daughter, we have to make the Bai family acknowledge you as their daughter before that happens.”

Qiao Mianmian widened her eyes in shock again. “Let the Bai family acknowledge me as their daughter? But-but that shouldn’t be possible. If the Bai family wants to acknowledge their daughter, they must do a paternity test. How could I...”

“I’ve said it before, you just have to cooperate with me obediently. When the time comes, I’ll arrange everything, including the paternity test. Qiao Anxin, once you become the daughter of the Bai family, your status will be completely different from now.

“If you become the daughter of the Bai family, you’ll have everything you want in the future. By then, Qiao Mianmian won’t be able to compare to you. Don’t tell me you’re not tempted...”

Shen Rou looked at Qiao Anxin with disdain.

She didn’t like people like Qiao Anxin at all. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

If not for the fact that she was the only one who could help her with this matter, she wouldn’t be willing to deal with such a lowly person.

These people who came from lowly backgrounds were all especially scheming.

Qiao Anxin couldn’t be any better.

Letting someone like Qiao Anxin become the daughter of the Bai family was really letting her off easy.

But no matter how much she disliked Qiao Anxin, as long as she could use her to deal with Qiao Mianmian, it didn’t matter if she took advantage of her.

Even if Qiao Anxin became the daughter of the Bai family, she would still have to listen to her obediently.

Letting the daughter of the Bai family become her chess piece and listen to her every command would make it much easier for her to do many things in the future.

She had already weighed the pros and cons of this matter, which was why they met this time.

Qiao Anxin looked at her in shock. She took a while to recover.

Her face was filled with uncontrollable excitement, and her heart was beating wildly. “But, but my age...”

“You don’t have to worry about that.” Shen Rou interrupted her. “It’s easy to change your age. The most important thing now is to confirm whether Qiao Mianmian is really a daughter of the Bai family. Also, you have to go back and do some work with your parents.

“This matter can only succeed if they cooperate with you.

“I believe your parents are smart people. They won’t stop their daughter from living a better life.”

Shen Rou saw that Qiao Anxin was already moved and reached out to her with a smile. “Anxin, I wish us a happy cooperation. The next time we meet, I might have to call you Sister Bai.”

Qiao Anxin stared at her blankly for a few seconds before slowly extending her hand.

Her hands were trembling, and her voice was trembling as well. “Miss Shen, I... I hope we can work well together.”

The daughter of the Bai family...

Could she really become the daughter of the Bai family?

The Bai family that she looked up to and thought would never have anything to do with her...

If she could really become the daughter of the Bai family, wouldn’t she become a socialite like Shen Rou in the future?
