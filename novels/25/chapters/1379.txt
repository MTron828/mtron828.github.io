“...”

“Then, I still want to eat ice cream, is that alright?” Qiao Mianmian didn’t harp on his work matters anymore. Since he was willing, she’d just be happy when they were together.

And she was actually very happy to know that Mo Yesi wasn’t leaving tonight.

She didn’t really want him to go back.

She just didn’t want him to work too hard.

“Ice cream? No.” The man furrowed his brows and pinched the tip of her nose. However, he did it very gently, afraid that it would hurt her. “You just ate hot pot, and you want to eat ice cream? Aren’t you afraid of feeling upset?”

“But I just want to eat ice cream now.” Qiao Mianmian acted coquettishly and shook his arm. “I want to eat mango-flavored ice cream. I really want to eat it. If I don’t eat it, I’ll feel uncomfortable all over.”

Mo Yesi was speechless.

“Mo Yesi, I want ice cream...

“Hubby, I want ice cream. Get me one. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Hubby, I know you’re the best. You’re the best husband in the world. You’re the best to me.

“Hubby, Hubby...”

Mo Yesi felt as if his heart was going to melt.

At this point, he felt that even if Qiao Mianmian asked him for the stars in the sky, he would agree.

He was willing to give her everything she wanted.

Not to mention ice cream.

His so-called principle was to remain unchanged in front of others.

He had no principles in front of the woman he loved.

Mango-flavored ice cream? He would get it for her immediately.

...

There was an ice cream shop beside the hot pot restaurant.

There was a queue outside the shop. It seemed like business was pretty good.

Mo Yesi let go of Qiao Mianmian’s hand and ruffled her hair. “Baby, wait for me here. I’ll queue up to get you an ice cream. Mango-flavored?”

They stood under a tree.

It was summer, and night had fallen.

The sun hadn’t completely set yet, and even though there weren’t many people in the queue, it was still very hot standing outside.

Qiao Mianmian really wanted to eat ice cream, but seeing that there were so many people in the queue, she immediately gave up. “Forget it. I’d better not eat.”

“Didn’t you say you wanted to eat it?”

“I really wanted to eat just now, but I don’t know how long I’ll have to wait. Let’s forget it.”

“I’ll queue up, wait for me here.” Mo Yesi looked at the queue and smiled. “Wait, I’ll be back soon.”

With that, he turned and walked towards the ice cream shop.

Qiao Mianmian watched as he quickly walked out of the ice cream shop. Most of the people queuing up to buy ice cream were girls. The moment Mo Yesi walked over, their eyes lit up.

A few girls seemed to have said something to him.

Qiao Mianmian saw that Mo Yesi had rolled up the sleeves of his shirt, revealing the bow on his wrist.

The girl’s leather belt on the guy’s wrist meant that he was already taken.

The young girls knew it too. When they saw the leather rope around Mo Yesi’s wrist, they looked disappointed and envious.

Disappointed that such a handsome man was taken.
