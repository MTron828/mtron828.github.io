Chapter 2418: Are You Done Playing?

Lin Wanwan shook her head and cried.

Mo Yesi stood at the door and watched expressionlessly.

To be honest, he didn’t feel anything when he saw how badly Lin Wanwan was crying.

He wasn’t a righteous person, to begin with, so he wasn’t interested in the so-called “fighting for justice”.

He wouldn’t do something so foolish.

He wasn’t interested in caring about others.

Besides the people he cared about, everything else had nothing to do with him.

If Qiao Mianmian hadn’t asked him to help, he would have pretended not to see anything.

He stood at the door expressionlessly until Lin Wanwan hit the wine glass that the rich man was about to feed her. Then, she was slapped by the rich man. He then said calmly, “Are you done playing?”

The sudden voice stunned a few of them, and they all turned around.

Lin Wanwan heard a familiar voice and looked up. She’d just been slapped and was about to faint. When she saw Mo Yesi standing at the door, she thought she was hallucinating.

She looked at the figure leaning against the door and widened her eyes in disbelief. “Brother Yesi…”

The few nouveau riches were shocked to see someone standing at the door.

The first person to react stared at Mo Yesi for a few seconds and asked suspiciously, “Who are you?”

The rich playboy felt that he looked familiar, but he couldn’t remember where he’d seen him before.

But even though he didn’t know Mo Yesi’s identity, he was still intimidated by his powerful aura.

The other two were the same.

Because Mo Yesi didn’t usually like to go out and play, he didn’t befriend many people. Moreover, he had been overseas for a long time, so many people weren’t familiar with his face.

But even if they didn’t know his identity, they could tell that he wasn’t an ordinary person.

Only someone who had been in power for a long time would have that aura.

“Who are you?” The other two nouveau riches asked.

They were a little unhappy to be disturbed.

But before finding out Mo Yesi’s identity, they were obviously worried.

“Brother Yesi, is it really you?” Lin Wanwan thought that she was hallucinating. She rubbed her eyes and looked at the slender figure at the door again. Then, she cried and shouted at Mo Yesi, “Brother Yesi, these bastards bullied me. Help me take revenge!”

“Brother Yesi?” The playboy heard the way she addressed him and felt an inexplicable sense of familiarity.

He stared at Mo Yesi for a few more seconds and murmured, “Yesi… Mo Yesi?” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The nouveau riche widened his eyes in shock. “Y-You’re Chairman Mo?”

The other two nouveau riches widened their eyes. “Chairman Mo?”

Although they had never seen Mo Yesi before, they were familiar with this name.

Because the elders in their family often used Mo Yesi to teach them how outstanding they could be. If they could compare to him, it would be the accumulation of their ancestors’ luck.

Mo Yesi was a legend in the business world.
