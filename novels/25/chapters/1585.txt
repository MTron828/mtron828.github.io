Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Everyone in the room exclaimed.

They were shocked.

They never expected Qiao Mianmian to throw a bottle at Boss Huang.

Even Boss Huang was shocked.

He widened his eyes and he was stunned for a few seconds before touching his forehead.

When he felt the blood on his forehead, his expression changed. When he looked up at Qiao Mianmian again, his eyes were filled with hatred.

...

In another private room.

Linda waited in the private room for a while. Seeing that Qiao Mianmian wasn’t back yet, she was a little worried and took out her cell phone to call her.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t pick up.

Linda’s expression changed.

She immediately got up and walked out of the private room.

Outside the private room, she saw two tall men in black. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Linda walked over and reached out to open the door.

The two men in black immediately stopped her. “Who are you? What are you doing?”

Linda frowned. Although she was worried about Qiao Mianmian, she still said patiently, “My friend is inside. Move aside, I’m going in to look for her.”

“Your friend isn’t in there.”

The two men quickly knew who she was referring to. “You can leave now.”

Linda stood still.

If she’d suspected something had happened to Qiao Mianmian before, she was almost sure now.

Qiao Mianmian was clearly in this private room.

But now, these two men were stopping her from entering.

If they weren’t suspicious, why would they stop her?

Linda frowned as she thought about it.

Qiao Mianmian’s face was attractive even to women.

If anything happened to her here, the consequences would be unimaginable.

“Get out of the way!” Linda tried to force her way in. She pushed one of the bodyguards and tried to open the door.

The other bodyguard immediately held her down.

Linda struggled and yelled, “Mianmian, Mianmian, are you inside? Let go of me and let me in. What did you do to Mianmian? Do you know whose woman she is? You’ll have to bear the consequences if you offend her.”

At the corner of the corridor.

A tall figure was escorted over.

The man in the middle was handsome. His facial features were as deep as a knife. His eyes were narrow and deep, and he exuded a luxurious aura.

His expression and his eyes were cold. His handsome and masculine face seemed to have the words “Do not approach” written on it.

The man walked expressionlessly.

When he heard Linda call out “Qiao Mianmian”, he stopped in his tracks and looked in the direction of the noise.

A middle-aged man in a suit and tie also stopped and followed his gaze.

He couldn’t figure it out and asked curiously, “Young Master Gong, is that lady someone you know?”

Gong Zeli frowned.

On the other side, Linda turned around and saw Gong Zeli standing not too far away. She looked happy and immediately waved at him. “Young Master Gong, Young Master Gong, quickly save Mianmian.

“She was locked in a private room. They aren’t letting me in.”
