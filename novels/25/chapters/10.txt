Chapter 11: I’ve Never Seen Someone So Shameless

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian initially thought that Mo Yesi was just another employee.

She didn’t expect that it’d be this difficult to get to see him.

Since she had already come all the way here, she was definitely not leaving until she met him.

She didn’t say anything more to the staff at the front desk, and instead walked to the resting area nearby and took a seat as she waited for Mo Yesi to knock off.

Seeing that she refused to leave, the two female employees began mocking her.

“How thick-skinned...”

“President Mo has never been appealed by women. So what if she looks a little pretty? President Mo would never be interested in a woman like her.”

Wei Zheng went downstairs to settle some matters.

As he walked past the front desk, a female employee called out to him.

“Personal Assistant Wei, this poor and pedantic lady came looking for President Mo. We’ve already told her that President Mo wouldn’t meet her if she didn’t have an appointment, but she’s just being annoying and refusing to leave. She’s been sitting there for two hours, and we’re worried that she’s tarnishing our image by putting up here. Should we get someone to chase her out?”

The employee glanced in Qiao Mianmian’s direction as she said that.

Jealousy filled her eyes.

Although she appeared poor, she was undeniably pretty.

It upset her.

“Someone’s looking for President Mo?”

Wei Zheng looked towards the resting area and saw Qiao Mianmian. He froze for a moment. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Then, a look of shock appeared on his face.

That woman... wasn’t she Miss Qiao that President Mo got him to check on?

What was she doing here?

Seeing that Wei Zheng’s expression changed, the employee at the front desk thought that he was unhappy with Qiao Mianmian’s hanging around too. She was full of conviction now. “I’ve never seen someone so shameless.”

Wei Zheng watched for a few more seconds before approaching her.

He made a phone call.

“President Mo, that Miss Qiao is here at the office. She says she wants to see you.”

The reply was cold and serious, “Miss Qiao, who?”

“Qiao Mianmian.”

“Her?” Mo Yesi was surprised.

“Yes. President Mo, would you like to see her? I heard she’s been waiting for two hours.”

There were a few seconds of silence.

“Bring her up.”

“Yes, President Mo.”

He hung up and walked to Qiao Mianmian.

He politely called her, “Miss Qiao.”

Qiao Mianmian looked up and saw the pleasant man in a suit. She was caught off guard. “You are...”

Wei Zheng said, “I’m President Mo’s assistant. I heard you’re looking for President Mo?”

Qiao Mianmian stood up. “Yes, I’m looking for Mo Yesi... No, President Mo, to discuss something. Could you take me to him?”

She pleaded with him with eyes that said she was afraid of his rejection. She added, “I just need ten—no, five minutes. I won’t take too much of his time.”

Wei Zheng nodded and smiled. “President Mo has agreed to see you. Miss Qiao, please come with me.”

As they watched Qiao Mianmian enter the elevator, the expression of the front desk staff changed drastically.

“What’s going on, aren’t we supposed to chase her out?”

“Personal Assistant Wei actually took her up? Could she really know President Mo personally?”
