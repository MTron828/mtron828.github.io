Chapter 105: When Did I Suddenly Have a Sister-In-Law?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Yes.”

She was just about to ask who paid for the bill, but she immediately guessed that it should have been Mo Yesi.

He said that he would treat them tonight.

Although she guessed it was him, Qiao Mianmian still sent him a message: [Did you pay for the meal?]

Mo Yesi replied quickly: [Yea.]

It was indeed him.

Qiao Mianmian was about to send another text message to ask him if he had eaten already when his phone call came.

She picked it up.

“Have you guys finished eating?” The man’s low magnetic voice sounded.

She didn’t know where he was, but Qiao Mianmian could hear a noisy background and the laughter of men and women.

“Yea, just finished. Have you eaten?”

“Not yet,” Mo Yesi said. “I’ve been busy playing with a few crazy bunnies, when could I find time to eat. I will probably just eat supper.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “Uh, little bunnies?”

“The few little bunnies who have been playing with me from when we were little.”

Just after Mo Yesi finished talking, Qiao Mianmian heard another voice coming from the phone, then a male voice said laughingly, “Second Brother, who are you calling? This gentle voice is giving me goosebumps. Isn’t it a woman?”

Mo Yesi simply acknowledged. “Mm.”

The man who had just spoken seemed shocked and said in a startled voice, “Is it really a woman? Do we know her?”

Mo Yesi replied, “Your sister-in-law.”

“Cough cough cough.” A violent cough sounded; the laughing man seemed to have choked. He coughed for a while before managing to speak. “Sister- Sister-in-law?! Brother, are you messing with me?! You have been single for years, and you still act awkwardly around women. When did I suddenly have a sister-in-law?”

“Are you sure this sister-in-law is alive? Is she really female? Is she a real living person that can be seen and touched, and not someone you imagined up?”

Mo Yesi sneered. “I have a wife, you’re the single dog.”

“Fuck!” The man burst out.

Mo Yesi was disgusted. “Go away, don’t swear next to me. Mianmian is still young, don’t ruin her.”

“F*ck! What the f*ck! Even my second brother has a wife, I will never doubt anything ever again.” The man burst out swearing again.

Qiao Mianmian clearly heard the dialogue between the two. “...”

This man who can’t stop saying “f*ck” is the little rabbit Mo Yesi was referring to?

Qiao Mianmian heard another shuffling sound, then the sound of the door opening, and then, the background noise became much softer.

She speculated that Mo Yesi should be in a place similar to a KTV.

He must have been in the room with a bunch of friends just now, but he just went outside.

A moment later, Mo Yesi’s voice rang out again. “That halfwit just now is the young master of the Yan Family, Yan Shaoqing. He has always been very vulgar, just ignore him.”

“Er...” Qiao Mianmian frowned.

Did he just talk about his own friend that way?

“I let a few people prepare some small gifts for your friends. Do they like them?”

Qiao Mianmian went silent and then lied. “Yea, they liked it. They told me to convey their gratitude.”

Mo Yesi smiled. “That’s great. Do you guys have other activities tonight?”

Qiao Mianmian glanced at Jiang Luoli. “No, we’re going back to school.”Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com
