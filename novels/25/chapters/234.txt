Chapter 235: Anxin, This Gift of Yours Is Too Valuable

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Tell me honestly, what exactly did you do to Mianmian that she’d be so angry with you?”

From Mother Su’s point of view, it must have been her son’s fault that this happened.

It couldn’t be because of Qiao Mianmian that they broke up.

“Mom, I...”

Su Ze was just about to explain things when a housemaid walked over, bowed to both of them, and said, “Madam, Young Master, Second Miss Qiao is here.”

Mother Su frowned. “Second Miss Qiao? What’s she here for?”

Mother Su didn’t quite like Qiao Anxin.

Though it wasn’t like she hated her either.

She was just rather neutral towards Qiao Anxin compared to her treatment towards Qiao Mianmian.

If it was Qiao Mianmian who came, she’d be very happy.

Su Ze’s expression changed slightly as he looked at the housemaid and said calmly, “Bring her in.”

“Yes, Young Master.”

The housemaid left and returned a few minutes later with Qiao Anxin. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Anxin was wearing a short black dress and had on exquisite makeup. She was holding a bouquet of flowers and carrying a paper bag of a luxury brand.

She had a sweet smile on as she walked towards Mother Su.

“Aunt, I heard from Brother Ah Ze that your birthday is coming up in a few days. I’ll be overseas for a shoot then and won’t be able to celebrate your birthday with you. So I decided to get you some gifts in advance, I hope you’ll like them.”

She handed the bag to Mother Su.

She then passed the bouquet of flowers to the housemaid and smiled. “I even bought your favorite lilies. They’re a new breed air-mailed from overseas and are a lot prettier than the common ones. Do you like them?”

Mother Su was taken aback for a few moments.

She had no idea how to react.

Especially when she didn’t have much feelings towards Qiao Anxin—be it liking or dislike.

She hesitated for a while before receiving the bag from her with a smile. “Anxin, you’re too kind. Our family has known your family for a long time, you don’t have to be so civil with Aunt.”

Qiao Anxin smiled. “Aunt, I’m not too sure what you like, so I bought it based on my intuition. Take a look and see if you like it?”

Su Ze added, “That’s right, Mom. Anxin took a lot of time and effort to pick this gift for you. See if you like it?”

Both of them were in sync with each other.

Although they weren’t saying anything odd or uncommon, Mother Su detected a hint of unusual intimacy between them.

She eyed both of them suspiciously but did not think too much.

She then took a sandalwood box out of the paper bag. Upon opening it up, she saw that it was a beautiful jade bangle.

Mother Su did have some knowledge of jade, and just by seeing its color and patterns, she could tell that it was worth a few million yuan.

The shock in her eyes was unmistakable as she slowly closed the box. She looked up at Qiao Anxin. “Anxin, this gift of yours is too valuable.”

The Qiao family wasn’t doing as well as before.

Although Qiao Anxin was making money as a celebrity, a few million yuan worth of a gift was too much for Mother Su.

After all, she wasn’t exactly close to this second daughter of the Qiao family.

Why would she get her such an expensive gift?

“It’s alright as long as Aunt likes it.” Qiao Anxin looked sensible and nice. “Moreover, Aunt is of great status, it’s only fitting that I get you something this valuable. Otherwise, how could it be good enough for you?”
