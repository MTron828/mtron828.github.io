Chapter 2124: I Can’t Do This

Lin Huizhen had talked with Father Qiao.

Although Father Qiao knew that Qiao Anxin had done something bad, she was still his biological daughter. He couldn’t possibly just let her suffer.

Although Qiao Mianmian was his adopted daughter, Father Qiao knew very well that she was very filial to him.

That was why he pleaded for Qiao Anxin.

Father Qiao thought that this was the last time.

If Qiao Anxin continued to do bad things in the future, he wouldn’t care anymore.

Qiao Mianmian held her wine glass with a disappointed expression.

At the same time, she felt cold.

She thought that if Father Qiao still pleaded on Qiao Anxin’s behalf despite knowing everything, it would really disappoint her.

She pursed her lips and kept quiet for a few seconds before asking, “Dad, you asked me to forgive Qiao Anxin. Then, do you know what she did to me?”

Father Qiao was stunned. He looked at Qiao Mianmian’s expression and hesitated for a while before saying, “I know a little.”

“You know, but you still want me to forgive her?”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t give Father Qiao any face this time. She said coldly, “Dad, if you want me to do something else, as long as I can help you, I’ll do my best.

“But I can’t do this.

“No matter how forgiving and magnanimous I am, it’s impossible for me to pretend that nothing happened after being schemed against time and time again. It’s fine if you think I’m petty, or that I’m not humane enough, but I can’t fulfill your request.”

Father Qiao’s expression stiffened.

He thought Qiao Mianmian wouldn’t reject him.

He raised her.

But even if Qiao Mianmian rejected him, he couldn’t say anything.

He knew very well that Qiao Anxin had gone overboard.

It was normal for Qiao Mianmian to refuse to forgive her.

But Lin Huizhen panicked at Qiao Mianmian’s attitude.

She thought that, as it was Father Qiao’s birthday, Qiao Mianmian wouldn’t reject his request. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

She didn’t expect Qiao Mianmian to reject him so directly.

She didn’t give Father Qiao any face.

If it was in the past, Lin Huizhen would’ve scolded her.

But now, she didn’t dare.

Qiao Mianmian was no longer the person she used to be.

Qiao Mianmian’s words were enough for them.

Lin Huizhen didn’t dare to offend her and could only curry favor with her.

She immediately turned around and gave Qiao Anxin a look.

Then, she smiled and said, “Mianmian, Anxin is young and insensible. She did something wrong. Your dad said just now that we’ve already punished her, and she won’t dare to do anything rash in the future.

“Don’t stoop to her level.

“I’ll get Anxin to apologize to you now.”

She then said coldly, “Anxin, hurry up and apologize to your sister! Promise her that you won’t make her angry again.”

Qiao Anxin bit her lip. She looked as if someone was forcing her to die on the battlefield.
