Chapter 9: This Is... the President?!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Chen didn’t know that Qiao Mianmian and Su Ze had broken up.

“It’s not him.”

Qiao Mianmian frowned in confusion, but she also couldn’t figure out the situation.

Su Ze had already broken up with her, so there was no way he was this kind.

It couldn’t possibly be Father Qiao either.

This VIP ward looked very expensive. Living here, even if you didn’t do anything for a day, it would still cost a lot of money.

No one from the Qiao family could afford it.

Who was it then?

Who was so kind as to help a brother and sister out for no reason?

Qiao Mianmian was puzzled.

“Knock!”

The door was knocked.

Qiao Mianmian walked over and opened the door.

A little nurse stood outside. Seeing her, she said with a smile, “Ms. Qiao, our president wants to speak to you regarding your brother’s condition. Please come with me.”

Qiao Mianmian’s eyes widened in surprise. “The president is looking for me?”

“Yes.”

President’s office.

The little nurse led her out of the door, reached out and knocked gently on the door.

The office door wasn’t completely closed.

A nice and young voice sounded. “Come in.”

Hearing such a young voice, Qiao Mianmian was a little stunned.

She reached out and gently opened the door.

When she walked in, she saw a pretty young man sitting at the desk. Looking to be about twenty-five years old, he had a gentle and handsome appearance, a pair of golden glasses on the bridge of his nose, and looked very gentlemanly.

This was... the President?!

Qiao Mianmian’s eyes showed undisguised surprise and hesitation.

The President was so young.

She had thought he would be at least fifty to sixty years old.

“Ms. Qiao, hello. Please sit down.”

When Qiao Mianmian looked at Lu Rao with surprise, Lu Rao also looked up at her with interest.

This was the little girl who had a thing with Mo Yesi?

Regardless, she was indeed rather beautiful. Even if she wasn’t dressed up, her original beauty couldn’t be hidden.

She looked to be in her early twenties and had exquisite facial features and glowing skin.

Even if he had met many beautiful people before, he still felt amazed. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

After looking at her for a moment, he smiled and said, “Ms. Qiao, there’s no need to be restrained. We are all young people, you can treat me like a normal friend.”

Qiao Mianmian relaxed a little.

She nodded and sat down with a smile.

“President, I heard you wanted to talk to me about my brother’s condition?” Qiao Mianmian asked without hesitation, “Is there any change to his condition?”

Lu Rao picked up the cup of coffee on the table and took a sip. “It has changed a little.”

Qiao Mianmian immediately became nervous. “How...”

“It’s better for your brother to get the surgery as early as possible. He has actually already missed the best surgery period after this incidence.”

Qiao Mianmian’s face suddenly changed, and her voice almost trembled. “What does it mean, he missed the best surgery period? Is it impossible to have surgery in the future?”

“It’s not impossible, but the surgery results wouldn’t be as good. Ms. Qiao, your brother’s operation can’t be delayed any longer.”

“I know...” Qiao Mianmian clenched her fists. “I, I will find a way to get him to perform the operation as soon as possible. However, you just said that if he were to undergo surgery now, the result wouldn’t be too good...”

“It depends on who is operating on him,” Lu Rao said inadvertently. “I know a person who is very good at performing this operation. If he comes forward, your brother’s rate of recovery can be as high as 90%. However...”
