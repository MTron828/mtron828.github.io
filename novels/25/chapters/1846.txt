Chapter 1848: I’ve Long Noticed That Something Is Wrong With Him

Qiao Mianmian’s heart was pounding. She took a deep breath, took two steps back, and quickly walked out of the room.

Third Chen’s scream and the sound of the glass bottle hitting the ground quickly alerted the others in the yard.

“What happened? What happened?”

“I heard someone screaming just now. What happened?”

“The sound seems to be coming from Qiao Mianmian’s room. Let’s go take a look.”

Zhan Bo and Su Mufei rushed ahead with worried expressions, worried that something might have happened to Qiao Mianmian.

When they rushed over, they saw Qiao Mianmian in her pajamas.

“Qiao Mianmian, are you alright?” Zhan Bo rushed forward and looked her up and down. After confirming that she was alright, he heaved a sigh of relief.

Su Mufei looked into her room and frowned. “What’s going on? We seemed to have heard someone screaming just now. Was it from your room?”

“Mm, it was.” Qiao Mianmian nodded. “Someone sneaked into my room and I knocked him unconscious. That scream was from that person.”

Zhan Bo: “...”

Su Mufei: “...”

The group of people who came along: “...”

“Someone sneaked into your room? Who is it?” Zhan Bo quickly realized the seriousness of the matter and looked at Qiao Mianmian carefully. “Are you alright? Did that person hurt you?”

“I’m fine.”

Qiao Mianmian was glad that she drank too little water and only woke up in the middle of the night to realize that someone was trying to open the door.

If she slept soundly, she didn’t know what would have happened.

Just the thought of it sent shivers down his spine.

“Mianmian, did someone sneak into your room?” Shen Fei walked over in her sleeping robe, her expression serious. “The scream we heard just now was a man’s voice. The person who sneaked into your room was a man?”

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian nodded.

Shen Fei’s expression became even more serious. She said with a serious expression, “Such a thing actually happened. It’s too scary. Who is it?”

Before Qiao Mianmian could speak, Zhan Bo said coldly, “Is it that Third Chen?”

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian nodded. “It’s him.”

“It’s really him. This old bachelor has been staring at you for the entire day. I’ve long noticed that something is wrong with him. I didn’t expect him to be so daring as to sneak into your room.”

“Which old bachelor? Is it the one we went to help with the cleaning today?”

“It’s that tramp!” Zhan Bo said angrily. “He stared at Mianmian all day.”

“F*ck.” Su Mufei’s expression changed. “Is he crazy? How dare he?”

“But Mianmian, you’re too amazing. You actually knocked him out?”

Qiao Mianmian nodded. She hadn’t even seen that she had knocked Third Chen’s head until he was covered in blood.

“No, we have to report this matter to the police. Go and call Zhao Yuan immediately and get the production team to call the police.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Alright, I’ll go right away.” Ren Jun turned around and went to look for Zhao Yuan.

“Is that tramp still in your room?” Zhan Bo asked.

“Well, he passed out.”

When they followed Qiao Mianmian into the house, she turned on the lights and saw Third Chen lying on the ground with blood all over his face. Qiao Anxin and Song Ke both covered their mouths and screamed.
