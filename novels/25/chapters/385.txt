Chapter 387: His Wife Was So Pretty, She Often Made His Heart Race

Mo Yesi took a look at it and handed it back to her.

Qiao Mianmian said, “Qiao Anxin fought with someone and even ended up at the police station. It sounds pretty serious.”

“Mm, I saw that.” Mo Yesi nodded. “Does fighting have a very huge impact on a celebrity?”

“Mm, pretty huge.”

“Do you need me to do anything for you?” Mo Yesi smiled. “I can make this an even bigger matter.”

It was a piece of cake for him.

Qiao Mianmian said, “... No need.”

She felt that Mo Yesi had misunderstood her intentions.

She handed him the cell phone for him to look at it, not because she wanted him to cause a stir.

Qiao Anxin was vile, but Qiao Mianmian didn’t intend to do her in while she was already down.

Otherwise, she wouldn’t be much different from her.

Mo Yesi raised a brow. “Really?”

“Yes!” Qiao Mianmian said seriously, “I believe retribution will find its way. Hasn’t she just got hers?”

“Alright.” Mo Yesi respected her decision. “If you don’t want to, then I won’t do it. But if you want my help anytime, you have to tell me. You don’t have to deal with it on your own.”

Qiao Mianmian felt warm and fuzzy inside. “Mm, I got it.”

Mo Yesi found his car and watched Qiao Mianmian get in first before going over to his side.

In the car, Qiao Mianmian looked at the news for a while more.

Qiao Anxin had fought in the lobby of the Yuncheng City Hotel.

Hence, there was a pretty big group of onlookers, and some even put up the videos they’d recorded online. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Qiao Mianmian watched the video and felt some suspicion.

The way Qiao Anxin hit the other woman in the video didn’t look like how a pregnant woman should be acting.

...

It was almost midnight when they returned to Lu Shan Gardens.

Qiao Mianmian lay on the bed right after her shower.

So much had happened in one day. She was exhausted.

She fell asleep not too long after, even before Mo Yesi was done with his shower.

By the time he walked out of the bathroom in his bathrobe, she was already sound asleep.

Mo Yesi walked to the bed while drying his hair.

This little girl only took such a small corner of the huge black bed.

She seemed all the more petite against the vast amount of space. Even in her sleep, her cheeks sported a pretty pink, and her lashes were lush and long.

She was wearing a nightgown, and she probably felt warm, as she’d pushed the blanket aside subconsciously.

Her long, slender legs were revealed.

Her skin was so fair, she was practically glowing under the light.

Mo Yesi couldn’t take his eyes off her.

He knew that Qiao Mianmian was beautiful.

But he still got awe-struck every once in a while, even now.

His wife was so pretty, she often made his heart race...

Mo Yesi watched her for a while more, before getting into bed very cautiously and gently wrapping her in his arms.

Qiao Mianmian smelt so good after a shower.

Mo Yesi caught just a whiff of her scent and managed to soothe his nerves.
