Chapter 564: Have You Ever Lied to Me?

“You don’t actually have the responsibility to help me. We... are just friends, after all.

“I know that very clearly. So, even if you decide not to help me, I will understand.”

“Rourou, have you ever lied to me?” Gong Zeli looked at her questioningly, and suspicion rose within him for the very first time regarding the truth of what happened that night.

No. Actually, it wasn’t the first time. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

He had suspected her once before.

But since that suspicion only lasted for a brief moment, he told himself that he was just overthinking things.

If it wasn’t Shen Rou that had saved him that night, who else could it be?

When he woke up from his coma, everyone around him told him that it was Shen Rou that saved his life.

She had admitted it herself too.

If it wasn’t her, why would she want to lie to him about it?

What benefits would she derive from lying to him about it?

But somehow, he just had a gut feeling now that it wasn’t Shen Rou who saved his life on that fateful night.

“What... what do you mean, Ze Li?” Shen Rou’s eyes widened as she looked at him with a hint of panic in her eyes and clutched one of her fists tightly.

Gong Zeli looked straight into her eyes. “That fateful night 10 years ago, you saved my life. Do you still remember what happened?”

Shen Rou froze for a moment and panic flashed past her eyes once again. She blinked purposefully, trying to calm herself down. “Of course, I remember. But why are you bringing this up all of a sudden?”

Gong Zeli caught every single expression that flashed past her face very clearly.

He naturally saw the panic in her eyes.

Although he was just speculating at the start, he started to confirm his suspicion after seeing her reaction.

“If it wasn’t for you that night, I might not even be on this earth right now. Because of that, I’m extremely grateful to you, Rourou. I can never fully repay my debt to you in my whole life.”

“It was also because of that night that I swore to myself that I would use every ounce of what I have within me to treat you well and take care of you.”

Shen Rou’s face was void of any happiness or affection even after she heard his words.

She couldn’t understand why Gong Zeli would suddenly bring this matter up at this point.

But she had a bad feeling in her heart.

She could feel that Gong Zeli was starting to suspect her.

But that incident was already so long ago, why did he not suspect her before but now?

“Rourou, we had a fight that day. I thought that you wouldn’t have saved me since you were still upset with me. I’m really thankful for you, and I will always remember everything that happened that day.”

Gong Zeli’s eyes were fixed on Shen Rou the whole time.

He saw how her expression slowly became unnatural as she started to unconsciously avoid his gaze.

As if she didn’t dare to look into his eyes.

Seeing her acting this way, Gong Zeli only had one thought in his mind.

He felt his heartbeat quicken as sweat started seeping out of his palms.

But his face was still plastered with the same expression, hiding all his thoughts and feelings.

“Why... why would I...” Shen Rou bit down hard on her lip as she took a deep breath. She glanced away from his questioning eyes and clenched her fist even tighter. “You’re my best friend, why would I not save you at such a moment?

“It... it was something that I should have done, you don’t have to thank me for it.”

“Rourou, I owe you my life. So, no matter what you ask me to do, I will help you.” The same darkness flashed past Gong Zeli’s eyes as he reached out to pat her head softly and gently spoke. “Since you wish to be with Ah Si, I will definitely help you.”
