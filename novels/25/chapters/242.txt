Chapter 243: The More He Thought About It, the More He Regretted It

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“I know you won’t blame me.” Mother Su was crying incessantly. “But our family has really done so much to hurt you, I’m too embarrassed.”

Mother Su wasn’t just devastated because Su Ze cheated. It was more so because she was very clear that after this, Qiao Mianmian could never be her daughter-in-law. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

She was this upset because she liked Qiao Mianmian that much.

Su Ze noticed Qiao Mianmian the moment she entered the living room.

From that moment on, he was unable to take his eyes off her.

He hadn’t seen Qiao Mianmian in a while, and she’d only gotten prettier.

She didn’t use to dress herself up and often wore very simple clothes with very little makeup. Even so, one could tell she was pretty.

Now that she learned how to doll herself up better, she was way more beautiful than before.

She was in a long black dress today, and it made her fair skin glow.

The dress was simple, but it brought out her charisma.

She was a little more like a lady now.

The makeup on her face was still very light, but she looked so much better than Qiao Anxin who had on exquisite and thick makeup.

Without anyone to compare Qiao Anxin to, she actually looked pretty.

But once she stood beside Qiao Mianmian, her looks were no longer outstanding.

Qiao Mianmian was just like a white swan, while Qiao Anxin was just a wild duck with slightly nicer feathers.

Even if she looked good, she was still a duck.

She couldn’t be compared to the elegant swan.

Su Ze looked at Qiao Mianmian’s prettier face and felt a tinge of regret.

He suddenly thought that he shouldn’t have broken up with Qiao Mianmian.

He’d always liked her.

And she had always been the wife he’d wanted.

Qiao Anxin was just his partner in bed and he’d never thought of marrying her.

But why did things turn out this way?

Back when Su Ze was with Qiao Mianmian, he hadn’t felt that she was that good.

But now that they were apart, Su Ze was beginning to feel different... especially after he knew that she was with another man now.

The more he thought about it, the more he regretted it.

Qiao Anxin was just slightly more successful in her career than Qiao Mianmian was. But besides that aspect, she wasn’t as good as Qiao Mianmian in any other way.

Moreover, even though he liked how good she was in bed, flirtatious women didn’t seem so innocent.

Who knew where she got all her techniques from?

On the contrary, the more conservative Qiao Mianmian was, the more he felt grounded.

The moment he began comparing Qiao Anxin to Qiao Mianmian, he suddenly realized that Qiao Mianmian was actually such a good girl, while Qiao Anxin didn’t seem so suitable for him anymore.

Su Ze’s eyes were practically burning from paying so much attention to her.

Qiao Anxin looked up and saw that he hadn’t even blinked while looking at Qiao Mianmian.

He seemed almost infatuated with her.

That enraged Qiao Anxin.

Qiao Mianmian was such a vixen!

Her appearance immediately shifted Su Ze’s attention away from Qiao Anxin herself.

Why was she always seducing men?

And she must have dressed like this today because she knew that Su Ze was home. She was out to seduce him.

Otherwise, why would she dress up like this just to discuss the rescission of the marriage contract?

“Brother Ah Ze, the man Sister is with must be really nice to her. That dress she’s wearing costs hundreds of thousands of yuan.”
