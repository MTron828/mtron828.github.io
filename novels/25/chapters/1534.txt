Chapter 1536: I’ll Leave After Your Birthday

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

It was so difficult.

It was so difficult to beg someone she liked.

Every word was difficult to say.

She didn’t even dare to look into Qiao Chen’s eyes, afraid that she would see disgust or ridicule in them.

He must find her ridiculous.

She actually had the cheek to make such a request.

Why should he help her?

These words seemed to have exhausted all her strength and courage. “The Shen family is in trouble now, and only the Mo family can help. But... but my sister and Brother Yesi have a conflict, and Brother Yesi isn’t willing to help now.

“Qiao Chen, if you can... say a few words, maybe Brother Yesi will change his mind.

“My sister did do something wrong, and I don’t want to defend her. But the Shen family really needs the Mo family’s help now, so can... can you help the Shen family this time?

“I’ll remember your kindness for the rest of my life.”

Qiao Chen was stunned.

A few seconds later, he said, “You wanted to talk to me about this?”

“Mm.” Shen Xin nodded. “I know that even if you help, Brother Yesi might not be willing to help. But, can you plead for the Shen family?”

Shen Xin looked up slowly, her eyes a little red. “I can’t think of anyone else. I... I can only look for you.

“If you’re willing to help, I can transfer schools immediately and promise not to appear in front of you again.

“I won’t pester you anymore. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Or if you have any other requests, you can tell me. I’ll agree to them.”

Qiao Chen narrowed his eyes and looked at her. “You want to transfer schools?”

“Yes.” Shen Xin smiled, but there was only bitterness in her eyes. “I remember that it’s your birthday in a while. Can I help you celebrate it? I’ll leave after that.”

The Shen family could go bankrupt at any time.

Mother Shen had already arranged for her to transfer to A City and live with her grandparents in the future.

She didn’t respond when Mother Shen told her about it.

At that time, she didn’t want to leave.

But now...

Shen Xin looked past him at Lin Xiaoya.

Qiao Chen and Lin Xiaoya had been together recently.

They attended evening self-study together, went to the library together, rehearsed for the drama together, and went to every place on campus together.

It was rumored that Lin Xiaoya and Qiao Chen were dating.

Shen Xin didn’t believe it.

She felt that Lin Xiaoya wasn’t Qiao Chen’s type.

But she finally believed it when she saw the two of them walking together every day.

Even if Qiao Chen wasn’t dating Lin Xiaoya, he should have a good impression of her.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t be with Lin Xiaoya every day.

She’d liked Qiao Chen for three years.

Hence, she knew very well that if Qiao Chen didn’t have feelings for a girl, he wouldn’t keep her by his side.

Just like how he didn’t like her.

Every time he saw her, he would avoid her.

He’d never let her stay by his side.

So, he really liked Lin Xiaoya.

Shen Xin suddenly felt sad.

Someone told her that as long as she persevered, something good would happen.

Hence, she persisted for three years. Even though so many people said that she was thick-skinned, she just smiled.
