Chapter 2579: Suspected

“Moreover, Qin Han has publicly praised her several times. These are all recognition of her capability. One of the sisters is right. Mianmian is really amazing as a newbie. Her future is limitless. The other seniors who were nominated for the Best Female Lead are all amazing seniors, so I don’t expect Mianmian to win the award. But being nominated is a recognition of her capability. I’m already very happy that she was nominated.”

“Mianmian, you’re the best! We’ll always support you!”

There were praises and slander.

Some were skeptical and unconvinced of Qiao Mianmian’s nomination.

“Did I see wrongly? Qiao Mianmian was actually nominated for the Best Female Lead Award? Look at the other three female artistes who were nominated with her. Which of them isn’t a capable senior in the industry? She’s just a newbie, and she just starred in her first television drama. How can she be nominated? Can she compare to the other seniors? Is there some shady deal?”

“Objectively speaking, Qiao Mianmian’s performance in ‘If You Can’t Love’ is alright. But she’s not good enough to be nominated for the Best Female Lead Award. I agree with the other three female artistes, but she’s really not convincing.”

“Did she spend money or use her connections to get the nomination? After all, she has a rich and powerful husband, and her family is very impressive. With the power of the Bai and Mo families, it’s not impossible to change the rules of the Golden Globe Awards.”

“What the hell, Qiao Mianmian’s Mary Sue-like acting can be nominated? The Golden Globe Awards has become so lousy now?”

The fans were naturally dissatisfied with the slander.

How could they slander Mianmian? nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Their Mianmian was nominated based on her capability, alright? What were the motives for those people to say that?

They just didn’t like Mianmian.

“Mianmian was nominated based on her own capability, alright? The comment section is criticizing her for spending money and using her connections. Before you criticize Mianmian, you should at least understand how strict the Golden Globe Awards are. If you can get an award just by spending money, can the most authoritative and professional award still be recognized by the industry?”

“The haters are all orphans without an M, right? They’re still blind and can’t see Mianmian’s acting in ‘If You Can’t Love’. Even Best Actor Qin Han and Best Actress Shen Fei praised her acting, and you think you can’t do it? You’re the hammer.”

“Take Mianmian away, we won’t date her. Please be merciful.”

“Yes, yes, yes. Our Mianmian doesn’t have any acting skills. She spent money and used her connections to be nominated. Does this mean that the haters are happy? Is it easy for Mianmian? She’s been in the industry for a few years. In the beginning, she was suppressed by her scheming sister and could only act as a passerby. It wasn’t easy for her to get the female lead role. She clearly made it based on her own ability, but rumors were still spread by the blind and evil haters. Those who spread rumors should die together, alright?”

After the list of nominees for the Golden Globe Awards was released, Qiao Mianmian’s fans and haters had a huge fight in the comment section.

In just half an hour, there were tens of thousands of comments.

Hence, Qiao Mianmian, who hadn’t done anything, made it to the hot searches again..
