Chapter 1029: Once You See Him, You’ll Be Touched

Jiang Luoli saw his long legs first.

Mo Shixiu and Mo Yesi had a pair of enviable long legs. Both of them were over 1.8 meters tall, and their looks, figure, and clothes were the best among men.

Jiang Luoli felt that she was too spineless.

Forty minutes ago, she thought that Mo Shixiu was a straight man who didn’t deserve any woman’s affection.

But now, seeing this man face to face, her heart started racing uncontrollably.

Her face started to burn.

She was no longer as calm as before.

As he approached her, her heart beat faster and faster...

Until he stopped in front of her.

Jiang Luoli suddenly felt flustered.

“Good evening, Miss Jiang. We meet again.” Mo Shixiu looked down at her and smiled.

The man was handsome and cold.

But when he smiled, he gave off a warm feeling. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Jiang Luoli felt as if she was going to faint.

At this moment, she couldn’t think at all.

Her mind went blank.

She could only hear her heartbeat.

“Good-good evening.” Jiang Luoli looked at the man’s handsome outline. She, who was usually eloquent, now stammered. “M-Mr. Mo, you’re back.”

Damn.

Mo Shixiu was a straight man.

But he was really good-looking.

It was too eye-catching!

Every time she saw him, she would be moved!

“Mm.” Mo Shixiu nodded at Sister Lin.

“Mister, are you hungry? Do you want me to get the kitchen to prepare dinner now?” Sister Lin looked at Mo Shixiu, then at Jiang Luoli and sighed in her heart.

Mister and Miss Jiang were such an eye-catching couple.

One was quiet, while the other was lively and quick-witted. Their personalities complemented each other.

How great it’d be if they were together.

With a young and energetic girl like Miss Jiang by his side, he wouldn’t be lonely anymore.

But Miss Jiang...

“No need.” Mo Shixiu loosened his necktie a little and looked down at Jiang Luoli. “Miss Jiang and I will eat outside. You don’t have to bother about us, just prepare your own dinner.

“Miss Jiang, I’ve booked the restaurant. Shall we go now?”

Jiang Luoli stared at his Adam’s apple and suddenly recalled that night.

Her mouth went dry.

She didn’t think the experience that night was good.

After all, the man’s skills were too terrible, making her uncomfortable.

But the thought of Mo Shixiu and her...

She felt that it didn’t matter if his skills were lacking.

With such a handsome face, many things could be forgiven.

“Miss Jiang?” Mo Shixiu looked at the dazed little woman in front of him and didn’t hear her response.

Jiang Luoli snapped back to her senses.

She looked up and saw Mo Shixiu’s handsome face. Her eyes flickered, and her heart was in a mess. “Mr. Mo, w-what did you just say?”
