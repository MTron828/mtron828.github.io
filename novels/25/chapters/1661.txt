Chapter 1662: I Didn’t Expect His Identity

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The eldest son, Mo Shixiu, was the next presidential candidate.

The second son was Mo Yesi, the youngest CEO in the history of the Mo Corporation.

Mo Shixiu often appeared on the news. Qin Han knew what he looked like.

But he didn’t know what the low profile Second Young Master Mo looked like.

Qin Han tried to figure out Mo Yesi’s identity and was even more shocked.

“He’s from the Mo Corporation...”

“Yes.” Bai Yusheng nodded before Qin Han could finish his sentence. “Just as you guessed.”

Qin Han saw the look in his eyes and knew that he shouldn’t continue.

But Bai Yusheng should have guessed what he was thinking.

This proved that his guess was true.

The media was speculating that Mo Yesi was from the Mo Family’s branch family.

But he was actually the Chairman of the Mo Corporation.

Who would have thought?

No wonder Boss Huang’s company was banned.

No wonder the Su Corporation was suddenly acquired by the Mo Corporation.

No wonder Qiao Mianmian’s scandals were quickly suppressed. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

If he was the Mo Corporation’s Chairman, he was indeed capable enough to do this easily.

“I didn’t expect this.” Qin Han was shocked.

But he felt that he shouldn’t be so shocked.

He should have known his true identity.

In that case, Qiao Mianmian really didn’t get the resources through connections.

Her boyfriend was Mo Yesi.

What kind of resources could she not get?

It wasn’t impossible for her to be the female lead.

Although Qin Han was shocked to know about this, he wasn’t so worried about Qiao Mianmian anymore.

With Mo Yesi as her backing, her future in the entertainment industry would be easier.

Mo Yesi could settle anything for her.

...

Mo Yesi left with Qiao Mianmian.

In the car park, he placed Qiao Mianmian in the backseat. He was afraid that the temperature in the car was too low, so he covered her with a thin blanket.

He drove all the way back to the apartment.

When they arrived, Qiao Mianmian was still sleeping soundly.

Mo Yesi got off first and then carried her out.

She still lingered with the odor of alcohol.

Mo Yesi looked at the girl sleeping soundly in his arms and frowned. He was unhappy with Bai Yusheng again.

He actually made his wife so drunk.

He was too incompetent.

Mo Yesi carried Qiao Mianmian into the house. As she was still unconscious, he had no choice but to carry her into the bedroom. After changing her into her pajamas, he gently placed her on the bed.

He then went to the bathroom to get some hot water and a wet towel. He then brought the towel to the bedroom to wipe her face and hands.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t feel anything.

The two glasses of red wine allowed her to sleep until the next day.

...

When Qiao Mianmian woke up, she saw that the seat beside her was empty.

But there was still traces of warmth on it.

After a night of hangover, her head still hurt. She rubbed her forehead and slowly sat up.

She had no memory of how she came back last night. She looked at her pajamas and couldn’t remember when Mo Yesi changed her clothes.

Those two glasses of red wine were too powerful.

Qiao Mianmian rubbed her aching forehead and swore that she would never drink so much again.
