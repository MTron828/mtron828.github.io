Chapter 141: Is He Mad?

With that, Mo Yesi hung up.

He tossed his cell phone aside and hugged Qiao Mianmian with both arms. “Shen Rou is rather loud and candid. She might seem hot-tempered, but she’s actually a nice and caring person. As for Third Yan and Fourth Gong, they’re usually more playful, so their reputations aren’t too good. Most people wouldn’t consider them as ‘good people’, but they’re just more open with their private lives. They’re good at heart.

“Third Yan is a live wire. Fourth Gong, on the other hand, doesn’t have a very good temper. And he’s a little bit of a clean freak. If you’re not comfortable with that, you can just pretend he isn’t there.

“In any case, you’re my guest, and my wife no less. They wouldn’t dare go too far with you around. You don’t have to worry.”

Mo Yesi was getting Qiao Mianmian prepared for it.

The guys around him weren’t the best people.

He knew them well, but this little lamb of his did not.

Qiao Mianmian listened quietly and then nodded. “Mm, I got it. I’ll just stick by you tomorrow and not wander off on my own. Will that do?”

Mo Yesi pinched her cheek and pecked her on the lips. “Good girl.”

At the other end of the world, in Saint Peter.

Shen Rou’s brows were knitted as she clenched her fingers around her phone.

She scrolled through her contacts and called Yan Shaoqing on his cell phone.

After ringing twice, Yan Shaoqing picked up the phone, sounding a little sleazy. “Young Lady Shen, why are you calling me again, you miss me? Just hold it out for a bit more, we’ll be seeing each other tomorrow. Or we could video call now if you can’t wait to see me any longer.”

Shen Rou’s brows furrowed even more tightly together. “Who’s missing you! Third Yan, I’m not in the mood to talk to you about this now. I’m going to ask you something. Tell me the truth.”

“What’s so serious?” Yan Shaoqing said cheekily.

Shen Rou clenched her teeth and hesitated for a few seconds. “Do you know about Ah Si’s marriage?”

“Oh, this?” Yan Shaoqing was a little stunned. He was a little more serious when he responded, “He told you about it?”

“Mm.” Shen Rou shut her eyes. “Although he said it himself, I can’t seem to believe that it’s true. You know how he’s like with women, how could he get married so suddenly.”

“He wouldn’t be this slipshod about his wedding.”

Yan Shaoqing kept quiet for a short moment before going on. “I’m not exactly sure how this took place. But it’s definitely true that he got married. You know Second Bro, he wouldn’t joke about something like this.”

“Sis-in-law sounds rather young, like an adorable girl. Sis-in-law says she’s really innocent and is still a student. As for other details, I’ve got no idea.”

“Student?” Shen Rou was taken aback.

“Mm, student.”

“Is he mad?” Shen Rou took a deep breath as her expression turned awful. “He went for a student? Do Aunt Mo and Uncle Mo know about this?”

“I’m not too sure about that. But I heard that Aunt Mo had plans to get Ah Si and the daughter of the Zhao family together. So it seems like they actually have no idea about this.”
