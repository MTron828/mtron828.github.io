Chapter 307: A More Relaxed, Uptight Version of His Old Self

The assistant was speechless.

Why was Director Bai smiling like a conman who’d just successfully tricked someone?

His expression was odd.

At the Mo Firm.

The President’s office.

Wei Zheng knocked on the door, entered, and delivered some news. “Chairman Mo, Young Madam’s audition was successful. Director Bai said not to worry and that he would take good care of her. He also said that he’s very satisfied with Young Madam and thanked you for recommending such a suitable actress for this role.”

At the desk.

The man stopped flipping his documents.

Mo Yesi looked up slowly, showing his handsome face.

“He said he’s very satisfied?”

“Yes,” Wei Zheng replied matter-of-factly. “He said Miss Qiao was just the third female role he was looking for.”

Mo Yesi went silent for a bit before saying calmly, “In that case, he’s not actually repaying my favor. I actually did him another favor?”

Wei Zheng was a little stunned. “Well...”

“Alright, you may leave.” Mo Yesi waved him out.

“Yes, Chairman Mo.”

Wei Zheng closed the door behind him gently.

Mo Yesi put his documents aside and picked up his cell phone. He thought for a bit before sending Qiao Mianmian a text. [Is your audition over?]

His cell phone vibrated soon after.

Qiao Mianmian replied to him.

Mo Yesi smiled as he read the message. He used the intercom telephone and called Wei Zheng back in.

“Report my schedule for today.”

“Yes, Chairman Mo.”

Wei Zheng recalled for a while and reported: “Chairman Mo, for the rest of today, you have a lunch appointment with Chief Executive Zhang of Guang Fa Bank. Later in the afternoon, you have a golf session with the Director of Heng Tong Firm. There are no scheduled appointments at night at the moment.”

Mo Yesi said, “Cancel the lunch appointment.”

“You want to cancel the lunch appointment with Chief Executive Zhang?” Wei Zheng reminded him kindly. “Chairman Mo, Chief Executive Zhang made this appointment more than a week ago. It won’t be nice to cancel it like this. There’s a project coming up soon, requiring a huge loan from Guang Fa Bank.”

“Postpone it to tomorrow.” Mo Yesi smiled once again as he read Qiao Mianmian’s message. “Let Chief Executive Zhang know that I have an important matter to attend to at noon today.”

“... Yes, Chairman Mo.”

Seeing that his Boss had already made the decision, Wei Zheng couldn’t say more.

In any case, he felt that Chairman Mo had become a lot more wilful ever since he got married.

Chairman Mo used to be a very principled man.

If he’d made an appointment earlier, he definitely wouldn’t postpone it at the last minute. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

At least, Wei Zheng had never seen him do something like this all these years.

Chairman Mo really was a more relaxed and uptight version of his old self since he returned...

No, it was since his marriage.

Wei Zheng could guess that Chairman Mo’s sudden change in plans was because of Young Madam.

He’d only act like this when it involved Young Madam.

“Have you settled the matter I got you to look into the last time?” Mo Yesi suddenly recalled that he’d instructed Wei Zheng to acquire the Qiao family’s villa. It was about time this was settled.
