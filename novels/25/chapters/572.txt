Chapter 573: I Won’t Trust You Again

The hand venturing all over her body stopped moving.

A few seconds later, he asked a little seriously, “You still feel unwell?”

Actually, it didn’t feel so bad anymore.

She felt unwell for just half a day.

She was much better now.

But Qiao Mianmian was afraid that he’d torment her in bed again and thus nodded sadly. “Mm, still unwell.”

So, could he let her off?

She really didn’t want to have trouble getting out of bed tomorrow.

Another silence.

Qiao Mianmian heard the man take a few deep breaths.

He seemed to be trying very hard to suppress something. When he exhaled, she could feel his warm breath all over her back.

The arm around her tightened, and then he said, “Alright, we won’t do it again tonight. But, I don’t wish to settle it on my own.”

Qiao Mianmian opened her mouth, but before she could say anything, he suddenly grabbed her hand and took it there. “Baby, you help me.”

There was no response.

...

An hour later.

Qiao Mianmian was lying on the bed, not wanting to talk to him.

“Baby, you’re angry?”

On the other side of the bed, the man reached his arm out towards her.

But she slapped it right away.

“Mo Yesi, go away. I don’t want to talk to you.” She sounded angry but adorable.

Mo Yesi knew what she was angry about.

She’d wanted him to finish sooner, but he held it out for more than an hour...

When it finally ended, she almost burst into tears.

She kept telling him that her hand was about to go limp.

And that he was bullying her on purpose, making her tired. She also kept saying that he was a baddie who didn’t even feel for her.

But she didn’t know that the way she sat by his foot was just so alluring.

How could he bear to end it so soon?

“Baby, does your arm ache? Should I massage it for you?” Mo Yesi smiled.

“Hmph! Don’t pretend to care.”

Qiao Mianmian slapped his hand away again. “Liar, I won’t trust you again.”

He said he’d end it fast.

But he lasted over an hour.

Her arm was about to break, now she didn’t even have the strength to pick up her cell phone.

And that hand of hers kept trembling.

She was never trusting his words again.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

All men were pig trotters.

“I’m sorry, Baby.” The man apologized quickly and shifted over to her, holding her in his arms despite her struggle.

He kissed her on the neck and said, “I didn’t do it on purpose. It won’t be like this next time. Be good, put your hand over. I’ll massage it for you.”

Qiao Mianmian would be a big fool if she trusted him.

He said this all the time.

But when did he manage to keep to it?

Actually, this wasn’t what made her angriest. It was the fact that... he was too excited when he was about to end, and...

Some of it got onto her!

Qiao Mianmian fumed thinking about it.

She really really didn’t want to bother about him anymore.

This man was too much.

Although he carried her to the bathtub and rinsed her after that, Qiao Mianmian still found him unforgivable.
