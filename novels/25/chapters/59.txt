Chapter 60: How Dare They Be so Arrogant!

“Do you still remember that Chairman Mo was also like this in the last meeting?”

“Is Chairman Mo dating?”

“How could that be? Chair Mo has always shown little interest in women. If he falls in love, could he really not show any signs?”

Outside.

Mo Yesi answered Qiao Mianmian’s phone call and called Wei Zheng.

“Chairman Mo.”

Mo Yesi pulled off the tie on his neck, turned and walked towards the elevator entrance. “Help me host the meeting, I’m going out.”

What?!

Wei Zheng was stunned.

He was just a small assistant, so how could he host such a high-level meeting?

Also, why did Chairman Mo suddenly want to leave when the meeting was going well?

This was a very important meeting.

Wei Zheng immediately chased after him.

“Chairman Mo, I can’t do it.” He summoned his courage before he uttered. “There are senior executives sitting in the meeting. It’s not good if I host the meeting.”

Mo Yesi walked hastily.

He went to the elevator entrance and pressed on the button. “If I said that you can, you can. Stop talking nonsense, this is part of your job. If you can’t do it, then leave immediately.”

The elevator doors opened.

After saying this, Mo Yesi went in and closed the elevator door.

Wei Zheng: “...”

He had been threatened with getting fired, so he really didn’t dare to have other opinions.

He didn’t dare to say anything else.

The world was big and the boss was the biggest.

No matter how difficult or challenging the task was, he had to complete it.

Thinking of having to face so many senior executives, Wei Zheng felt the pressure on his shoulders.

Why did he feel like Chairman Mo was becoming more and more willful recently?

He left early whenever he wanted and could even leave halfway during a meeting.

He was never like this before!

As soon as Qiao Mianmian made the bed, she heard a noise from downstairs.

There was a lot of movement, and several people in the bedroom ran out to watch. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

She also left with Jiang Luoli.

She looked downstairs and saw a group of men dressed up socially going into the girls’ dormitory. The dormitory aunt stopped them from entering.

The dormitory aunt was in her fifties and was naturally not the opponent of those men.

She couldn’t stop them even if she wanted to.

One of the men showed an impatient look on his face. He stepped forward and pushed her, pushing her directly to the ground.

“Damn it, they are too much. This is the school, but they dare to be so arrogant!” Jiang Luoli was furious.

Qiao Mianmian’s face also sank, and she pursed her lips tightly. “Shen Yueyue actually brought all these men to school. She’s really daring.”

If this matter was investigated by the school, Shen Yueyue would definitely be punished.

This was also clear to Shen Yueyue.

The reason why she dared to do so, apart from her so-called rich and handsome godbrother, must be because she had another backing.

Otherwise, she wouldn’t dare to be so fearless.

Qiao Mianmian suddenly realized that she hadn’t told anyone about her break up with Su Ze.

But how did Shen Yueyue and everyone else in the bedroom know?

“Luo Luo, let me ask you something.” Qiao Mianmian’s eyes were dull and several degrees colder.

In her mind, she already had some guesses.

“What’s the matter?” Jiang Luoli watched the group of young people enter the girl’s dormitory and asked anxiously. “Baby, what about your help? Why haven’t they come?”

Qiao Mianmian was silent for a moment before asking, “Who told you about my break up with Su Ze?”
