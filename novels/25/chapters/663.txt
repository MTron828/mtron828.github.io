Chapter 664: Since You’re a Newbie, You Should Have the Self-Awareness of a Newbie

Huang Yilin pursed her lips and raised her eyebrow. “Do you know Director Bai? Are you close to him?”

Qiao Mianmian looked at her in shock.

Without waiting for her reply, Huang Yilin asked a few more questions. “You’re an actress from our crew? You look unfamiliar. Are you a newbie? I heard that Director Bai picked a third female role on the day of the audition. Was it you?

“Director Bai gave you his contact details just now. Can you give me his number?”

Huang Yilin’s questions were rather aggressive.

It didn’t sound like an ordinary questioning.

It was more like an interrogation.

Moreover, she was obviously looking down on Qiao Mianmian.

A woman’s sixth sense was very strong.

After Huang Yilin asked a series of questions, Qiao Mianmian immediately realized that she had an unusual interest in Bai Yusheng.

Recalling her reaction when she saw Bai Yusheng, Qiao Mianmian was almost sure that Huang Yilin liked Bai Yusheng.

Perhaps Bai Yusheng’s actions made her feel threatened or jealous...

So, she was here to gather information?

Although she had never interacted with Huang Yilin before, Qiao Mianmian could feel that this woman had a bad temper.

She wasn’t as approachable as when she was in public.

On the contrary, she should be an assertive woman.

Moreover, she wasn’t someone to be trifled with.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t want to offend such a person.

She still had to stay on set for three months.

She wanted to spend the rest of her life in peace. She didn’t want to get into any trouble during this period.

Moreover, she had nothing to do with Bai Yusheng.

She thought for a while and replied with a smile under Huang Yilin’s scrutinizing and hostile gaze, “Senior Huang, Director Bai and I have only met once during the audition, so we aren’t familiar with each other. On the day of the audition, Director Bai recognized me and set me up on the spot. I’m deeply honored.

“I’m even more flattered to be able to work with such an outstanding senior like you.

“As for Director Bai’s cell phone number, I’m sorry, Senior Huang. I can’t give his cell phone number to anyone without his permission.”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t expect that Huang Yilin didn’t have Bai Yusheng’s cell phone number.

She thought that they had a good relationship. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Huang Yilin’s expression didn’t change much at first.

After Qiao Mianmian refused to give her Bai Yusheng’s number, her expression darkened.

She looked at Qiao Mianmian coldly for a while and suddenly laughed. “Miss Qiao, do you think you can put on airs in front of me just because you have Director Bai’s backing?”

Although she was smiling, her eyes were cold and sharp.

The hostility in her eyes was almost overflowing.

Qiao Mianmian frowned. “Senior Huang, I think you’ve misunderstood. I didn’t...”

“Qiao Mianmian, if you think that Director Bai took the initiative to speak to you and asked for your contact information because he liked you, you’re too naive.”

Huang Yilin interrupted her coldly. “Since you’re a newbie, you should have the self-awareness of a newbie. Don’t think that you can take shortcuts just because you’re pretty.”
