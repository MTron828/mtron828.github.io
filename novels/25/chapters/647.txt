Chapter 649: Boyfriend Is So Handsome, Who Would Bear to Break Up?

“Ah, right.”

With Mo Yesi’s reminder, Qiao Mianmian looked at the time and remembered that she hadn’t changed her boarding pass.

She took out her documents and was about to go when Mo Yesi said, “Give me your documents, I’ll help you change.”

“Oh.”

Qiao Mianmian handed him the document.

Mo Yesi took it and patted her on the head. “Wait for me here, don’t run around.”

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian nodded.

After he left.

Nana couldn’t hold back her curiosity and immediately grabbed Qiao Mianmian’s hand. She asked excitedly, “Sister Mianmian, is he your boyfriend?”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t hide anything from Linda, so she naturally wouldn’t hide it from her.

Nana was her assistant, and they would spend a lot of time together.

Even if she didn’t say it, Nana could tell.

“Mm.” She nodded. “He’s my boyfriend.”

“Wow.” Nana was so excited that her face reddened. She turned to look at Mo Yesi, who was already far away. “Sister Mianmian, your boyfriend is so handsome. Gosh. I swear he’s definitely the most handsome man I’ve ever seen.

“Sister Mianmian, is he a signed artiste too?”

Qiao Mianmian said, “... No. ”

“No?” Nana was stunned for a moment before asking, “Then, is he an artiste signed by another company?”

“... Not really.”

Qiao Mianmian rubbed her forehead in amusement. “He’s not an artiste. He’s not in the same industry as us.”

“What?!” Nana was in disbelief. “He’s not an artiste? Does he not intend to work in the entertainment industry?”

Qiao Mianmian shook her head. “He doesn’t have that intention.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“That’s too much of a pity. I can guarantee that if he enters the entertainment industry, he’ll definitely be popular with just his looks. Sister Mianmian, I finally understand why you’d rather lose a contract signing opportunity than break up with your boyfriend.”

Qiao Mianmian asked, “... Why?”

Nana’s eyes sparkled. “Your boyfriend is so handsome, who would bear to break up with him? If you lose a chance to sign a contract, you’ll have another one in the future. If you break up with such a handsome boyfriend, you’ll never find another one in the future.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She suddenly realized that Nana and Jiang Luoli both became idiots for good-looking people.

Not long after they changed their boarding pass, they were about to go for their tickets.

Mo Yesi accompanied Qiao Mianmian to the ticketing counter. When he looked down at her, the reluctance in his eyes deepened.

He tidied her hair and pulled her into his arms. He then kissed her on the forehead. “Baby, take good care of yourself. Don’t make me worry about you.”

“Mm.”

As they got closer, Qiao Mianmian felt even more reluctant.

She wrapped her arms around his waist and pressed her face against his chest. “You have to take good care of yourself too.”

“Alright. Call me as soon as you land.”

“Mm.”

“Wear more clothes before getting off the plane. It’s cold over there, don’t catch a cold.”

“Mm.”

“You can call me anytime you want. My cell phone is on 24/7.”

“Mm.”

“Remember, you have a husband. Don’t go around flirting with fresh meat.”

“... Mm. ”

“Baby, I’ll miss you every day. You have to miss me too.”

“Mm.”

“Alright, go and check the tickets.”
