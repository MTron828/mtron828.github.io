Chapter 2711: Such an Arrogant Person

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Mr. Gong, in order to show my sincerity and to reassure you, I can make an investment in the Gong Corporation first.” Tang Ya obviously knew that Gong Zeli wouldn’t believe her easily. Thus, she showed her sincerity. “I’ll be the one to pay the most for our future cooperation. Mr. Gong, you just have to pay the remaining small portion.

“Such sincerity should be enough. Or, what do you think I should do to show my sincerity?”

Her offer was tempting.

It was very sincere.

But Gong Zeli still looked indifferent, as if he wasn’t interested in her conditions at all.

He said coldly, “The Gong Corporation doesn’t lack investments. Miss Tang, there’s something you haven’t figured out. No matter how estranged the Gong and Mo families are now, no matter what my relationship with Mo Yesi is now, it has nothing to do with you.

“Even if I want to deal with the Mo family, that’s my own business. I don’t need to work with any outsider. You’ve found the wrong person.”

Tang Ya had always been calm and composed.

At this point, her expression finally cracked. She no longer looked like she didn’t care about anything.

Her expression stiffened and she frowned. “Mr. Gong, can you reconsider? I don’t want your answer immediately. It’s a win-win situation for us to work together. You don’t have to reject me so quickly.”

“No need.” Gong Zeli said expressionlessly, “If I, Gong Zeli, want to do something, I don’t need the help of an unrelated person. Miss Tang, the ten minutes are up. Our conversation is over.”

“Mr. Gong, we…”

“Miss Tang, I don’t care what feud you have with the Mo family, nor do I care who you are. But remember, Qiao Mianmian isn’t someone you can touch. If you dare touch her, I won’t let you off.”

Gong Zeli left.

Tang Ya’s face darkened.

She watched as Gong Zeli walked out of the cafe.

She bit her lip as she stirred the coffee.

Gong Zeli!

She didn’t expect him to be uninterested in her suggestion.

She didn’t expect him to be such an arrogant person.

She thought that this was a simple task.

Her conditions were good enough.

She thought that Gong Zeli would never reject her.

As long as Gong Zeli agreed to work with her, it would be much more useful than working with the Shen family to deal with the Mo Corporation.

The Shen family was far inferior to the Gong family.

Now that the Shen Corporation had been acquired by the Mo Corporation, she had to find another partner.

And the Gong Corporation was undoubtedly the best choice.

Her power wasn’t in Yuncheng City.

There were many things that she couldn’t do without her partners.

She needed to find a partner in Yuncheng City who wasn’t much weaker than the Mo family.

She didn’t have a choice previously. Hence, even though she knew that the Shen family wasn’t up to the task, she still chose to work with Shen Rou.

But now, the Gong and Mo families were no longer friends. Gong Zeli and Mo Yesi even broke their brotherhood because of a woman.. She thought this was a good opportunity.
