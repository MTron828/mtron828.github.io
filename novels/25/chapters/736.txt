Chapter 737: Call Me Hubby and I Won’t Be Angry

She guessed that he hadn’t eaten.

He flew over right after work.

She knew how picky this man was.

Even if it was an organic meal on the plane, and he was sitting in the first class, he wouldn’t eat it.

He had high expectations for the ingredients.

If it wasn’t the freshest ingredients, he wouldn’t even take a second look.

Mo Yesi’s anger vanished.

The girl’s voice was soft and sweet, and her lips were soft and moist.

His heart had melted.

A certain part of his heart had long softened.

Especially when she called him Hubby.

Although it wasn’t a direct greeting, it was enough to make him surrender.

“Baby, you just called me Hubby.”

Mo Yesi wrapped his arms around her and took a deep breath. “I won’t be angry if you call me that again.”

Not only was he not angry.

He could even give her his life.

Qiao Mianmian was usually too embarrassed to call him that.

She always felt awkward. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

She wasn’t used to... calling him that.

Although this man was already her husband in name.

But it seemed like she hadn’t officially called him Hubby yet.

Mo Yesi made a few requests.

She was too embarrassed to reject him.

Now that she wanted to coax this man, she didn’t think too much about it.

As long as she could make him happy, he was willing to do anything for her.

She was just calling him Hubby.

It wasn’t difficult at all!

“You won’t be angry if I call you that?” She blinked and looked at him cutely. She even bit her lip.

She probably didn’t even know how alluring her actions were.

Mo Yesi’s Adam’s apple bobbed as his dark eyes landed on her tender pink lips. His eyes darkened as he felt his body heat up.

He had the urge to pin her down and bully her.

But he tried his best to suppress it.

He tightened his arm around her waist and said hoarsely, “Mm. Call me Hubby, and I won’t be angry anymore.”

Mo Yesi knew not to miss this opportunity. He didn’t know when he would get her to call him “Hubby” again.

His wife was too shy.

He had made so many requests, but she hadn’t said anything.

This was a great opportunity.

She wanted to coax him. As long as his request wasn’t too overboard, she would definitely agree to it.

He wouldn’t miss such a good opportunity.

“Mm, then... alright.”

Qiao Mianmian looked up at his handsome face and then at his deep and dark eyes. After looking at him for a while, she said softly, “Hubby...”

Gosh.

She was so shy.

Her cheeks burned even more after she screamed.

The arm around her waist tightened. The man’s hot and hurried breathing could be heard above her head. Her head was against his chest, and she could hear his heartbeat accelerate.

“Baby, call me that again.” Mo Yesi hugged her tightly, his voice even lower and hoarser than before. “Be good, call me that again.”
