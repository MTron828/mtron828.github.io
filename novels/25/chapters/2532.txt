Chapter 2535: What Is She Afraid Of?

“Damn, Mianmian, did you see that Shen Rou actually pushed all the blame to her sister? She’s about to clear her name.

“I’m so angry. I thought I could definitely take her down this time. I didn’t expect her to use such a method to clear her name. What should we do? Is there nothing we can do about it?

“Are we just going to let her clear her name?”

Linda’s angry voice came from the phone.

In the car.

Qiao Mianmian leaned against Mo Yesi’s shoulder lazily. She was a little surprised to hear this. She didn’t expect Shen Rou to have a backup plan. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

She rubbed her temple and straightened up.

“Sister Xie, are you saying that Shen Rou posted on Weibo saying that everything was done by Shen Xin?”

“That’s right.” Linda was furious. “How could she be so disgusting? Isn’t Shen Xin her biological sister? How could she have the face to frame her own sister like this? This woman is too scary. She can even hurt her own kin.

“It’s not easy to win against such a person.”

“She’s really heartless.” Qiao Mianmian frowned.

“Then, what should we do now? Do we just let her clear her name? I can’t accept this!” Linda said angrily.

“Of course not.”

Qiao Mianmian frowned and kept quiet for a few seconds before saying tiredly, “I’ll take a look on Weibo first. I’ll call you later.”

“Alright, go take a look first.”

After ending the call, Qiao Mianmian went into a daze.

Until a voice rang in her ears and pulled her back to reality. “What happened?”

Qiao Mianmian snapped out of her daze and looked into Mo Yesi’s eyes.

Qiao Mianmian pursed her lips and was a little annoyed. “Sister Xie called me just now and said that Shen Rou pushed all the blame to Shen Xin. I thought that the evidence I prepared this time was enough to bring her down. I didn’t expect that she would drag Shen Xin out to defend her in order to clear her name.”

She had let her off.

She didn’t expect Shen Rou to sacrifice her own sister.

Mo Yesi was a little surprised.

“She said that Shen Xin did everything?”

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian nodded.

“She’s really cruel.”

“So, now that she’s cleared her name, isn’t everything I’ve done for nothing?” Qiao Mianmian bit her lip and frowned. “I can’t think of a way to deal with her now.”

But she couldn’t take it lying down.

“Don’t worry.” Mo Yesi thought for a while and patted her head. “No matter how much she tries to clear her name, she won’t be able to do well this time. Baby, I’ll teach her a lesson for you.”

Qiao Mianmian blinked. “Teach her a lesson?”

“Mm.” Mo Yesi narrowed his eyes and said casually, “Do you know what Shen Rou is most afraid of? Reputation is important to her, but it’s not what she’s most afraid of.”

“What is she most afraid of?” Qiao Mianmian asked curiously.

Mo Yesi smiled. “She was pampered since she was young and led a superior life. To her, her status as the Young Lady of the Shen family is the most important. She’s used to the superiority and social status that her current status gives her. What she’s most afraid of is losing all of this.”
