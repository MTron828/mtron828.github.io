Chapter 1102: A Woman Like Her Is Too Scheming!

“Ah Si, Mianmian, Grandma got someone to make your favorite dishes. Are you guys hungry? Do you want to eat something first?” The Old Madam ignored her after reprimanding Madam Mo a little. She held Qiao Mianmian’s hand and walked towards the dining room.

She looked at Qiao Mianmian with pity in her eyes. “Isn’t it tough filming outside? I haven’t seen you for a few days, but why do I feel like you’ve lost some weight? I heard that as actors, you can’t eat too much and have to maintain your figure, right? From what I see, there aren’t so many rules. You’re already so skinny, why are you still maintaining your figure? You should eat more, you’ll look better with more meat.”

The older generation still preferred slightly fatter girls.

Qiao Mianmian’s figure was considered standard. She wasn’t fat or too skinny. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

But in the old lady’s eyes, she was still thinner.

The Old Madam’s protection warmed Qiao Mianmian’s heart. She no longer cared about Madam Mo’s attitude towards her.

She affectionately hooked her arm around the old lady’s arm and carefully supported her. She replied sweetly, “Yes, I’ll listen to grandma. Eat more tonight! With grandma caring so much about me, I don’t feel tired at all!”

“Hahaha, you child.” Old Madam looked like she was enjoying it.

In the living room.

Mo Yesi frowned at Madam Mo, who was still sitting on the sofa with a cold expression. He said patiently, “Mom, let’s go eat.”

Madam Mo raised her head and looked at him coldly. “You only remembered now that you have a mother?”

Mo Yesi frowned.

Madam Mo sneered and said, “Who do you think I am? I think I’m superfluous. I won’t disturb your family’s happy meal. With me around, all of you will feel uncomfortable and unhappy.”

She then got up and called a maid over. “Bring my dinner upstairs later.”

The maid looked at Mo Yesi hesitantly. “Second Young Master, this...”

Madam Mo’s expression immediately changed, and she said fiercely to the maid, “Why are you asking Second Young Master about the things I’ve instructed you to do? What’s wrong? Do I really have no status in this family? I can’t even order you around anymore?”

The maid’s expression changed instantly. “No, it’s not like that, ma’am.”

Mo Yesi’s patience had finally run out. He took a deep breath and looked at Qiao Chen, who was still standing at the side. Suppressing his anger, he said, “Chen Chen, go over and eat first.”

Qiao Chen looked at the black-faced mother and son, hesitated, and asked softly, “Brother-in-law, what about you?”

Mo Yesi said calmly, “I’ll be there soon.”

Qiao Chen glanced at Madam Mo again and nodded. “Alright, we’ll wait for Brother-in-law to eat together.”

Mo Yesi asked one of the maids to bring Qiao Chen to the dining room and asked the other maids to leave first.

After Qiao Chen left, his tone was no longer as calm as before. With a hint of anger, he asked Madam Mo, “Mom, what are you trying to do? Are you trying to stop me from returning to this house?”

Madam Mo also looked at him angrily. “What do I want to do? Didn’t I tell you the other day? Ah Si, I’m telling you clearly that I won’t agree with you two being together. Do you know what kind of woman she is? She’s after your money!

“A woman like her is too scheming! You’ll suffer in her hands sooner or later if you get together with her!”
