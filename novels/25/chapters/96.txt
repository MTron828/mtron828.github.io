Just being rich was not enough to dine in the banquet hall. They had to also possess a distinguished status in order to dine there.

If Qiao Mianmian’s boyfriend would treat them to a meal in such a place, it was obvious that he was of extraordinary identity.

The two girls’ expressions were a little complicated as they stared at the luxurious car worth tens of millions of yuan and the expensive gift in their hands.

But their expression didn’t look the least bit happy.

Although they had been envious when Qiao Mianmian was dating Su Ze, it hadn’t amounted to jealousy.

But at this moment, they couldn’t help but feel green with envy at the thought of the remarkably handsome and respectable man.

They had to rack their brains for schemes just to find a man with fine qualities.

On the other hand, Qiao Mianmian managed to find such an outstanding man without a hitch.

It would be a lie to say that they weren’t jealous nor envious.

They both felt like Qiao Mianmian actually wanted to show off her new boyfriend to them.

Otherwise, why would she invite them to the banquet hall?

Why would she prepare such gifts for them?

She obviously wanted to show off how rich her boyfriend was.

The two of them felt discomfort at this thought.

Qiao Mianmian noticed their tense expressions and froze for a moment before asking curiously, “Xiao Xiao, Yuwei, what happened?”

“Nothing.” Zhang Yuwei returned to her senses and smiled politely. “Mianmian, thank your boyfriend for me. It’s my first time receiving such an expensive gift, I really adore this brand’s skincare product.”

“Yeah, your boyfriend is so generous. This set of skincare is worth a few tens of thousands of yuan. You must thank him in our place.” Bai Xiao also smiled.

Their expressions returned to normal.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t think much of it and just smiled. “I’m glad you both like it. Let’s get into the car, we should come back soon.”

At the banquet hall.

Bai Xiao and the others got out of the car and saw a few people standing at the entrance.

One of them was the manager of the clubhouse. When he saw them, he quickly came forward to greet them. “Miss Qiao, ladies, good evening. Chairman Mo has instructed me to receive you. Please follow me and watch your steps.”

Everyone knew the boss of this banquet hall was an extremely influential person.

Even the workers here were slightly proud and haughty.

Diners here all had to respect the workers as well.

But now, these proud workers were extremely respectful to them.

They understood the reason behind it.

It was surely because of Qiao Mianmian’s rich and handsome boyfriend.

Bai Xiao and Zhang Yuwei not only didn’t feel happy at receiving such respectful treatment, but the sour feeling of jealousy also deepened further in their hearts.

Qiao Mianmian’s current boyfriend seemed much more powerful and rich than Su Ze.

Only Jiang Luoli was in high spirits. She wandered around excitedly and whispered to Qiao Mianmian, “Mianmian, have you been here before? This place is so high-class, it looks like a palace.”

“It’s my first time too.” Qiao Mianmian was also secretly sizing the place up.

The banquet hall was the same style as the restaurant Mo Yesi brought her to previously.

But it was multiple times bigger and the interior decorations were even more luxurious. It truly looked like a palace.
