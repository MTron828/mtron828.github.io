Qin Han reposted it.

Qin Han V: [You’re welcome. You’re the one who performed well. My help is just icing on the cake. Actually, I believe many people will cherish talent if they can meet outstanding juniors. I hope that your future will be better. Good luck.]

Qin Han’s fanbase was huge.

And most of his fans were loyal.

Hence, after he posted on Weibo and expressed his admiration and support for Qiao Mianmian, his fans also reposted her post.

Showing their support for their idol.

The person Brother Han admired was definitely outstanding.

Brother Han was supportive, so were they.

Hence, many of Qin Han’s fans started promoting Qiao Mianmian’s new show. They said that it wasn’t easy for newbies and asked everyone to support Qiao Mianmian.

Not long after Qiao Mianmian appeared on the hot searches, the Huacheng International Film Corporation released a Weibo post on the annual movie, “Phoenix in the Air”.

It was a Weibo post that confirmed the list of actors.

The female lead was Shen Fei.

The male lead was Jiang Wen.

The second female lead was Qiao Mianmian.

The third female lead, a popular female star.

The second and third male leads were also popular artistes in the industry.

In this movie, even the guest actors were second-tier.

Amongst the A- and B-list celebrities, a newbie like Qiao Mianmian was especially eye-catching.

What was even more eye-catching was that she was playing the second female lead role.

Once the post about the cast list was released, the comment section exploded.

Almost everyone was talking about Qiao Mianmian.

“The second female lead, Qiao Mianmian? Are you kidding me? She’s just a newbie, what right does she have to be given such an important role? First, she acted with Best Actor Qin Han, and now she’s playing the second female lead in such an important movie? Damn, her backing is too strong. Is she going to use all the big shots as her backers?”

“I’ve seen the list of actors. Besides Qiao Mianmian, the worst one is a C-list actress. And she’s just a supporting character. I’m sure Qiao Mianmian got the role through her backing. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have gotten the second female lead role.”

“Yeah, the third female lead is an A-list celebrity. What is she?”

“She must have used her background. It’s great to have a rich and powerful boyfriend. She can get whatever resources she wants. I’m glad that my goddess Shen Fei is still the female lead and hasn’t lost her role.”

“Do you think she doesn’t want to steal Shen Fei’s role? She doesn’t dare to. An actress with both fame and ability has to be the female lead of such a big movie. If a newbie like her takes the female lead role, she’ll definitely be scolded like a dog. Shen Fei’s fans aren’t to be trifled with. No matter how good her boyfriend is, Shen Fei is the top sister in this industry.”

“If she didn’t steal Shen Fei’s role, then she must have stolen someone else’s role. I really detest this kind of person. In the past, our company also had such a parachutist. He didn’t have any ability and even gained an important position. It’s really disgusting.”

# Qiao Mianmian’s Backing # quickly made it to the trending list.

As a newbie like Qiao Mianmian stood out too much among the big shots, no one believed that she got the role on her own.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m
