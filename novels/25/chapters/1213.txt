Chapter 1215: The Relationship

In front of her was a road with no setbacks.

Her future was bound to be resplendent for everyone to envy.

But...

Qiao Anxin bit her lip, and hatred flashed past her eyes.

She would not let this happen.

Never!

So what if she was a real swan?

She would never be a swan in her life.

It seemed like she was blessed by God. Everything was good.

But Qiao Anxin felt that she was still the most blessed by God.

She didn’t have a good background, but she lost to Qiao Mianmian at the starting line.

But she had a benefactor to help her.

Whatever she did not have, she could snatch it and make it hers.

For example, Su Ze and Qiao Mianmian. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

At the thought that her identity would change drastically after tonight, Qiao Anxin couldn’t help but feel excited.

After tonight, she would no longer be an ordinary girl from the Qiao family.

She would become the beloved daughter of the Bai family and live a glorious life.

By then, Qiao Mianmian would be nothing.

So what if Bai Yusheng and Madam Bai liked her now?

When that happened, Bai Yusheng would become her brother, and Madam Bai would become her mother.

She didn’t believe that they would treat Qiao Mianmian better than she did.

“Alright, stop standing at the door.” Madam Bai looked at the time and said, “Yusheng, the banquet is about to officially begin. Go on stage and have a few words with the guests first. Mianmian and the rest, I’ll take care of them.”

Bai Yusheng nodded and walked into the hall.

Madam Bai held Qiao Mianmian’s hand. “Mianmian, let’s go in too. Aunt Bai asked the kitchen to prepare some food for you. Shall I bring you over to eat something?”

She then looked at Mo Yesi. “Yesi, do you mind if I take Mianmian away for a while? Don’t worry, I’ll take good care of her and return her to you later.”

Mo Yesi looked deeply at Madam Bai.

From the moment he started having doubts about something, he felt that Madam Bai’s decision to take Qiao Mianmian away wasn’t as simple as just bringing her out for dinner.

But since Madam Bai had spoken, and it was such a small matter, it was impossible for him not to agree.

He wasn’t worried that Madam Bai would do anything to Qiao Mianmian.

“Since Aunt Bai cares about her, I have no reason to disagree.” Mo Yesi rubbed Qiao Mianmian’s head and said gently, “Then, you and Aunt Bai can go and eat something first.”

Qiao Mianmian was indeed hungry, and Madam Bai had invited her so enthusiastically, so she nodded. “Okay.”

When Madam Bai saw that she had agreed, she was obviously very happy. Her eyes were full of smiles as she said intimately, “Come, good child, follow Aunt Bai.”

When Madam Bai was talking to Qiao Mianmian, she had forgotten that Shen Rou was standing beside her.

She pulled Qiao Mianmian along for a few steps before suddenly remembering. She turned to Shen Rou and smiled. “Rourou, don’t stand on ceremony. If you’re hungry, go fill your stomach in the dining area.”

Shen Rou’s smile stiffened. “Okay.”

Madam Bai asked her to eat in the living room while she brought Qiao Mianmian to the kitchen.

The relationship between them was obvious at a glance.

Madam Bai had also acted like she liked her and was very intimate with her as if she was her own daughter.
