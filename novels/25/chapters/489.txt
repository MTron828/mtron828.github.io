She looked at that exquisite face and felt a surge of excitement.

Tu Yilei himself was standing right in front of her.

And he was so much more handsome in person than on screen.

Especially his face... how could it be this small?

Qiao Mianmian felt as if Tu Yilei’s face was even smaller than hers. And those facial features were so perfect, so flawless, they seemed to have been carefully carved.

She was standing so close to him, and she couldn’t see a single pore on his face.

His skin was so good, it was like the surface of a peeled hard-boiled egg—soft and bouncy.

Having such great complexion as a man really put many women to shame.

Tu Yilei wasn’t old, and he dressed very simply even though he was a megastar.

He had on a loose-fitting black tee, black pants, a pair of sports shoes, and a cap. He was dressed so simply and wearing what an average person would wear, but he looked so many times better.

He was almost like a trendsetter.

It seemed like it all boiled down to his looks, after all.

Nobody would find this trendy or fashionable if a commoner wore it.

“Hello, I’m Tu Yilei.” Tu Yilei didn’t seem arrogant at all as he went forward to introduce himself. His smile was bright and charming. “I’m sorry, I bumped into you earlier. Are you alright?”

Qiao Mianmian snapped back to her senses and shook her head. She was a little abashed as she responded, “I should be the one to apologize. It was me who bumped into you first. Are you... alright?”

Although Qiao Mianmian didn’t think he was injured whatsoever, it was only polite to ask.

“I’m fine.” Tu Yilei smiled and straightened up.

He looked at Qiao Mianmian and then turned towards the office. “You’re here to sign the contract?”

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian looked at this humble megastar and instantly had a good feeling towards him.

Many celebrities who appeared approachable and friendly in front of the public weren’t actually so easygoing personally.

Most of them were just putting on a front.

She was less intimidated by him now. “Mr. Tu, are you here to sign the contract too?”

“We’re about the same age.” Tu Yilei smiled. “You should just call me by my name.”

“Uh, I can do that?” Qiao Mianmian hesitated.

Although they were about the same age, he joined the industry and became famous much earlier.

He was considered her senior.

Wasn’t it rude to address him by his name?

Tu Yilei didn’t seem to mind, though. He nodded and said, “Of course you can.”

“Little Tu Tu, you’ve got a commercial to film later. You’d better sign your contract and leave, there’s no time to lose.” The man standing beside Tu Yilei furrowed his brows when he saw that Tu Yilei and Qiao Mianmian were getting along well. He shot Qiao Mianmian an unfriendly glare as if he was guarded against her.

Qiao Mianmian was surprised by this reaction.

Was that Tu Yilei’s manager?

Was he afraid she was trying to take advantage of Tu Yilei’s popularity?

Qiao Mianmian didn’t want any misunderstandings. Although she found Tu Yilei to be a nice person, she didn’t intend to continue chatting with him for much longer, just in case anyone assumed she had a personal agenda. She simply ended off by saying, “Well, I have something to attend to, so I’ll get going first. We’ll... meet on set!”

Tu Yilei simply “Mm-ed” and smiled. “Alright, see you on set.”

“I’ll be off, then. Bye!”
