Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

With the exposed diamond ring, Qiao Mianmian was trending again.

Almost everyone was talking about her ridiculously expensive diamond ring.

On top of that, the movie she was starring in was about to be released. In the next week, Qiao Mianmian was almost always on the hot searches list, and she became the most popular artiste in the entertainment industry.

The wedding was about to start.

The Bai and Mo families also found a time to gather and discuss the wedding.

Madam Bai wanted to let her precious daughter get married extravagantly so that everyone would know how good her daughter was and how important she was to the Mo Family. Therefore, she encouraged the wedding to be more high-profile and lively, so that they could get more reporters to film and Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

report on it.

“Marriage is a once-in-a-lifetime event. You can keep a low profile on everything, but not on this matter. Since we’re holding a wedding, let’s do it so that everyone can witness Mianmian and Yesi’s happiness.

“When the time comes, you must invite more people. If you find it troublesome and don’t know who to invite, leave this matter to me.” Madam Bai was originally not very satisfied with Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi’s low-profile marriage, as she felt that it had wronged her precious daughter. Now that they

were holding a wedding, she naturally wanted it to be grand.

‘The Bai family’s daughter’s wedding could not be held casually.

Not even if Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi had already collected their marriage certificate.

The necessary procedures had to be completed.

Even if Madam Bai knew that her daughter was living happily and that her son-in-law was a reliable person, the Mo Family still owed her precious daughter a grand wedding.

They had to make it up to her no matter what.

“Lagree with what my in-laws said.”

Perhaps because her grandsons’ wedding was near, Old Madam was in high spirits. She looked much better than before, and her face was much redder. “I think weddings should be more lively, too. Regarding Mianmian and Ah Si’s wedding, our Mo family can do whatever we want, mainly depending on

our in-laws and Mianmian.

“If Mianmian likes the excitement, let’s do it.

“If she doesn’t like it, we should be more clear about it. This is a wedding between the two juniors. It’s up to them to decide how to hold it.”

“Old Madam is right.” Father Bai nodded. “No matter what we say, it’s just a suggestion. We still have to see what Mianmian and Yesi think.”

“Then, what do you think?” Mo Yunchen turned to look at his son.

After Mo Yunchen and Madam Mo divorced, she moved out of the Mo Residence. This time, only Old Madam and Mo Yunchen came forward to attend the wedding..
