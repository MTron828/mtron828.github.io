“Well, her boyfriend is rich, but that money isn’t hers. As a newbie, I think it’s good enough that she donated five ambulances.”

“Haha, you can’t even bear to support your girlfriend at a time like this. It’s obvious that her boyfriend doesn’t really like her.”

“Now that I think about it, yesterday’s public display of affection was really awkward.”

The discussion in the live-stream was heated.

Outside the live-stream, Qiao Mianmian and Little Xiao were on the hot search list.

#Little Xiao is beautiful and kind. A donation of five million yuan in ambulances to a charity event. Impressive!#

#Love Angel Little Xiao, donating five million yuan in ambulances#

#Qiao Mianmian only donated five ambulances for the charity event, where did her rich boyfriend go?#

...

Mo Corporation.

Mo Yesi had just finished handling a batch of documents and was about to call Qiao Mianmian during his break to ask if she was done.

Just then, his cell phone rang.

He looked at the caller ID and picked it up.

“Second Brother, have you seen the news today?” Yan Shaoqing asked.

Mo Yesi frowned slightly. “No, why?”

“No wonder you didn’t do anything. Do you know that you’re being looked down upon?”

“What do you mean?”

“You know that Sister-in-law is attending a charity event today, right?”

“Yeah, I know.”

Qiao Mianmian sent him a WeChat message.

“In addition to donating blood, they also donated an ambulance for that charity event. That Little Xiao who isn’t on good terms with Sister-in-law also went. She donated five million yuan in ambulances. Sister-in-law also donated, but she donated less than her.

“Now, her fans are mocking you and Sister-in-law in the live-stream. They say that Sister-in-law has found a rich boyfriend, but he can’t bear to spend money on her. They also say that you’re probably just playing with Sister-in-law, so you can’t bear to spend money on her.

“Anyway, you and Sister-in-law are being mocked by her fans.”

Mo Yesi frowned.

“Second Brother, I don’t think you can let others look down on you. Besides, you have to support Sister-in-law. That woman’s fans are so proud that they’re going to soar to the sky and trample Sister-in-law under their feet.

“When I saw this, I couldn’t take it lying down, so I called you.”

Mo Yesi understood the situation and was silent for a while. His deep eyes were cold, but his voice was calm. “The live broadcast is still ongoing?”

“Yes, but it’s almost over. That woman’s fans are dancing happily in the live-stream.”

“Give me the live streaming channel.”

“Alright, I’ll send it to you right away. Second Brother, I’ll wait for you to show your prowess!”

Yan Shaoqing quickly sent the link to Mo Yesi’s Weibo.

Mo Yesi clicked on the link.

The moment he entered the live-stream, he saw a flurry of comments.

Just as Yan Shaoqing had said, Xiaoxiao’s fans were jumping around in the live-stream. While supporting their idol, they were also trampling on Qiao Mianmian.

Mo Yesi’s expression darkened within a minute.

These fans were still spamming gifts in the live-stream, saying their family’s Little Xiao was so generous. Her fans couldn’t be stingy. The gifts they were spamming could be considered as offering their love along with their idol.

This group of fans was spamming gifts and even mocked Qiao Mianmian’s fans for being as stingy as her. None of them helped her with gifts.

Mo Yesi called Wei Zheng into the office with a dark expression.

“President Mo.”

The moment Wei Zheng entered the office, he saw Mo Yesi’s dark expression and felt a little fearful.

“Come here.” Mo Yesi waved at him.
