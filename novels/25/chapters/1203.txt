Chapter 1206: Qiao Mianmian Is Already Owned

Although she didn’t know those women, she could tell from their clothes and looks that they must be socialites.

And she noticed.

From the moment Mo Yesi got out of the car until now, those socialites had already looked in their direction several times.

Her husband was too outstanding and popular with the opposite sex. Sometimes, she still felt insecure.

Mo Yesi chuckled and looked around, but he couldn’t see anything. His gentle gaze then landed on her face. “Good-looking and outstanding women? Where are these women you’re talking about? Why don’t I see any of them other than you?

“Besides, who else can I have feelings for other than you? You filled my heart alone, baby. I don’t have a place in my heart for anyone else.”

For the 101st time, Qiao Mianmian’s heart pounded.

Her heart was filled with sweetness.

No wonder women like to hear sweet nothings, she thought.

It was no wonder that some men would be willing to follow them even if they did not meet the criteria.

Because nice words could really make one happy.

“Ah Si, Mianmian.”

Bai Yusheng came out to greet the guests. When he saw Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi, he walked towards them.

It was his birthday, and he seemed to be in a good mood. There was a smile on his face.

“Happy birthday, Brother Bai.”

Qiao Mianmian looked at him and handed him the box. “I picked this for Brother Bai. I hope you like it.”

Bai Yusheng immediately took it.

He looked down and smiled. “Did you choose this gift yourself?”

“Mm, I picked it myself.” Qiao Mianmian emphasized. “This is a birthday present for Brother Bai. Thank you, Brother Bai, for your care and guidance. I’ll definitely act well in your drama and not embarrass you!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Mianmian then handed him another box and smiled. “This gift is a token of appreciation from Ah Si and me. I hope that Brother Bai’s future scenes will get better and more people will like your scenes. I hope that Brother Bai will become more handsome and more people will like you. Anyway, I hope that everything will get better for Brother Bai!”

Bai Yusheng glanced at a certain someone who was in a bad mood. The smile on his lips deepened, and he became even happier.

He took the gift and looked Qiao Mianmian up and down. “Brother Bai also hopes that you’ll get better in the future. You look very pretty today. If it weren’t for Ah Si’s quick reflexes, a lot of young talents would be fighting over you tonight.”

“That’s why I’m reminding your young and handsome friends.” Mo Yesi reached out and wrapped his arm around Qiao Mianmian’s slender waist possessively. “Qiao Mianmian is already taken. Tell them not to have any ill intentions.”

Bai Yusheng sneered. “With you by Mianmian’s side, who would dare to have designs on her? Instead of worrying about others having designs on Mianmian, you should worry about yourself.”

As Bai Yusheng spoke, he turned his head and looked in a certain direction. He said gloatingly, “Your old friend will be here tonight as well. However, I didn’t invite her. My mother invited her.”
