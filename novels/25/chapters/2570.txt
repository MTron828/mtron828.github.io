Chapter 2571: He Wasn’t Even Interested in Taking a Look at Them

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Oh? Familiar?” Gong Zeli smiled. “Chairman Zhao, what do you find familiar?”

This smile made the middle-aged man shudder.

He didn’t dare to speak the truth.

Unless he wanted to die.

Speaking of which, he had worked with the Gong Corporation a few times and was considered Young Master Gong’s business partner.

But he didn’t dare to offend him.

Everyone in Yuncheng City knew Young Master Gong’s temper.

This man was temperamental and could turn hostile at any time.

He might be smiling at you now, but it might be hiding a knife.

Hence, even if the middle-aged man guessed something, he didn’t dare to say it.

“Hahaha, my eyes were playing tricks on me just now. Now that I look at her again, she doesn’t look like her anymore. Since Young Master Gong has an appointment with a beauty, I won’t disturb you anymore. When Young Master Gong is willing to give me face, I’ll treat you to a drink.

“Young Master Gong, I’ll make a move first. See you another day.”

With that, the middle-aged man turned around and left.

He walked quickly as if someone was chasing him.

Gong Zeli looked in the direction he left in and sneered.

“Fourth Bro, I didn’t expect you to arrive before me.”

Just as the middle-aged man left, Gong Zeli heard a voice behind him. He turned around and saw Yan Shaoqing walking towards him with a hot female companion.

It was another unfamiliar face. It seemed like Yan Shaoqing’s new lover.

The woman was very beautiful. At first glance, she was stunning. She could be considered a top-notch beauty.

But Gong Zeli only looked at her for a second before looking away.

Except for her, he found other women boring no matter how beautiful they were.

He used to think that he liked Shen Rou, but he didn’t feel this way towards her. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

He didn’t have a strong desire for Shen Rou.

And he wasn’t interested in other women because of her.

But he felt differently towards Qiao Mianmian.

After realizing that he liked her, there were no other women around him.

Those women weren’t her.

He wasn’t even interested in taking a look at them.

He finally knew what it was like to really like someone.

He finally understood that he had never really liked Shen Rou.

Even before he knew the truth, his feelings for Shen Rou were just gratitude. It had nothing to do with love.

Yan Shaoqing walked towards Gong Zeli with his new lover in his arms. He was smiling, but when he saw the petite figure standing behind Gong Zeli, he was shocked and speechless.

“Fourth Bro, why are you still…”

Yan Shaoqing was about to ask why he hadn’t sent this little girl away when he suddenly recalled how he scared her to tears last time. He changed his words. “Doesn’t this little girl have to go to school? Why is she here with you?”

“The internship period is more relaxed,” Gong Zeli said calmly.

“Oh.” Yan Shaoqing nodded.

“Y-Young Master Yan.”

Su Su walked out from behind Gong Zeli and looked at Yan Shaoqing timidly..
