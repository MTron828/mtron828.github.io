Qiao Anxin was delighted by Zhan Bo’s change in attitude.

Everything seemed to be going according to her prediction.

As long as she took down Zhan Bo and Qin Han first, they would be on her side.

Then, the netizens’ impression of her would change from negative to good.

Zhan Bo and Qin Han were the most popular in the industry.

They had countless fans.

With them on her side, the fans couldn’t say anything.

Qiao Anxin was happy and wanted to take the opportunity to gain more affection.

Looking at Doudou watching television on the sofa, she thought for a while, then squatted in front of him and reached out to touch his head. “Doudou, do you have anything you want to eat? Mommy is going to cook. Mommy can make anything you want to eat.”

Qiao Anxin thought that Doudou wouldn’t be so against her anymore.

She thought he was just too timid in front of strangers.

Unexpectedly, she was once again rejected by Doudou.

Seeing that she was about to touch him, Doudou jumped off the sofa and ran to Zhan Bo’s side as if he was shocked. He hugged Zhan Bo’s leg, and the rejection on his face was obvious. “Daddy Zhan~”

He called out to Zhan Bo, wanting to hug him.

Zhan Bo looked down at Little Doudou, who was hugging his calf with a terrified expression on his face. He couldn’t help but have some doubts.

He bent down and picked him up.

“Doudou, didn’t you say you were hungry? Mommy is going to cook for you, why did you run away?” Zhan Bo found it strange. He wondered why Doudou disliked Jiang Xinyue so much.

Logically speaking, this was the first time Doudou and Jiang Xinyue met.

Jiang Xinyue didn’t do anything bad to him.

If he was afraid of strangers, then he would be afraid of him too. But that didn’t happen.

But why was Doudou so afraid of Jiang Xinyue?

This wasn’t the first time he rejected her.

Doudou buried his head in Zhan Bo’s arms and said in a muffled voice, “Daddy Zhan, Doudou wants to eat your food. Can you cook for Doudou?”

Zhan Bo was stunned. Then, he looked a little embarrassed. “Doudou, Daddy Zhan doesn’t know how to cook. Mommy cooks very well. Can we eat Mommy’s food? If you have anything you want to eat, you can tell Mommy. She’ll make it for Doudou.

“Don’t be afraid, Doudou.” Zhan Bo could feel the little guy’s uneasiness and reached out to pat his head. He said gently, “Isn’t Daddy Zhan here? We’re men, men have to be more daring. The uncles and aunties here like Doudou very much. No one will treat Doudou badly.

“So, you don’t have to be afraid, alright?” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Zhan Bo had never interacted with a child before.

He didn’t know how to coax him.

He thought that if he couldn’t handle this child, he’d go and learn from Qiao Mianmian.

Thankfully, his words were enough to calm Doudou down.

He looked up from Zhan Bo’s arms and looked at him with his big black eyes. He had a finger in his mouth and tilted his head as if he was thinking about something.

After a while, he asked softly, “Daddy Zhan, can I have a sandwich and fries?”
