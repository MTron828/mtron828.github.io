Chapter 2379: A Lifetime of Regret

And she used to have his only love.

If she had chosen him at that time and married him, even if he found out the truth later, he wouldn’t have pursued it.

She could still be the only person in his heart.

But…

She realized it too late.

By the time she realized how good he was and wanted to be with him, it was too late.

He realized that she wasn’t his savior.

Then, all his special treatment was canceled.

At that time, Shen Rou realized that Gong Zeli wasn’t a good-tempered person. He wasn’t generous to everyone.

She lost her uniqueness with him, and his coldness and heartlessness hurt her.

This man she’d never taken to heart had now become a man she couldn’t get.

This difference made Shen Rou hate him, but she also couldn’t help but be attracted to him.

Without the special treatment, she started to get to know this man again.

She realized that Gong Zeli was really charming.

Just like now.

She looked at his handsome face and felt her heart race.

“Zeli, I found you familiar from behind and thought that it might be you, so I greeted you.” Meeting his cold and distant gaze, Shen Rou felt upset, but she still asked nonchalantly, “What are you doing here? Have you made an appointment with a friend?”

She was still wearing the black dress.

Actually, she should have changed before coming.

But all of a sudden, she wanted to have a drink here and couldn’t care less about changing her clothes.

Gong Zeli still didn’t say anything. He just looked at her coldly.

“I came straight from an event.” Shen Rou saw that he was looking at her and explained without waiting for him to ask anything. “I suddenly wanted to have a drink, so I came here. I didn’t expect to meet you.

“If you’re alone, we…”

“I’m sorry, I have an appointment.” Gong Zeli finally said something, but it was just to reject her. “They’re still waiting for me. Miss Shen, do as you wish. I’ll take my leave first.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

He then turned around.

“Zeli.” Shen Rou was hurt by his cold attitude, but she caught up with him. “Do you really want us to be strangers? Just because I… did something wrong, are you going to be cold to me forever?

“I’ve already apologized. Why can’t you forgive me on account of our years of friendship?”

“Miss Shen, I’ve made myself clear.” Gong Zeli didn’t stop. He walked faster and faster as if he didn’t see that Shen Rou couldn’t keep up with him. “I’ve said it before. When we meet again, we’ll treat each other as strangers.

“If an apology and repentance are enough, then everyone in this world is the Holy Father. It’s your business if you’re willing to be the Holy Father, but I’m not interested.”

Forgive Shen Rou?

He reckoned that he would never be able to do it.

It was because of her that he missed the person he was supposed to spend the rest of his life with.

This was a lifetime of regret.
