Chapter 1044: Why Didn’t He Treat Qiao Mianmian Better Before?

“I promise, she won’t dare to retaliate.”

Qiao Mianmian looked at him blankly for a while before asking, “Mr. Gong, you’re...”

She never expected that Gong Zeli would appear at this time.

And he even helped her slap that woman.

Was he standing up for her?

But their relationship wasn’t good enough for him to do that.

Qiao Mianmian frowned as she thought about the rumors about them online.

She and Gong Zeli had just gotten into a scandal.

If someone caught the scene just now and found out that Gong Zeli helped her, another scandal would probably ensue.

By then, it would be hard to clear things up.

If the first time was a scandal, the second time was a scandal, and the third or fourth time was a scandal.

Especially since Gong Zeli wasn’t a busybody.

If it had nothing to do with her, would he stand up for her again and again?

Even she couldn’t understand it, let alone others.

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t sure if the crowd recognized her.

The woman had yelled her name out loud on purpose. She wondered if anyone had recognized her.

“Even if it’s because of my relationship with Ah Si, I won’t let anyone bully you.” Gong Zeli felt a little guilty when he saw her confused look.

He dared not look her in the eye again.

He was afraid that she’d read his mind.

Hence, he used his relationship with Mo Yesi as a shield.

But he knew very well why he helped her.

His help had nothing to do with Mo Yesi.

He helped her because of the secret in his heart.

That secret that only he knew.

Qiao Mianmian was stunned for a few more seconds before the confusion in her eyes dissipated.

That was true.

Although she didn’t have much of a relationship with Gong Zeli, he and Mo Yesi were close buddies, after all. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Seeing his brother’s wife was being bullied, he couldn’t just ignore it.

Even if he didn’t like her.

At this point, he had to step forward to help.

“Thank you, Mr. Gong.” Qiao Mianmian wanted to return the slap, but since Gong Zeli had already returned it for her, she didn’t intend to do it again.

Moreover, that woman was already trembling in fear from Gong Zeli.

Gong Zeli frowned when she thanked him.

Her polite and distant attitude made him uncomfortable.

He could feel that she was deliberately keeping a distance from him.

Was it because of the rumors about them?

Or was it because he treated her too badly and left a bad impression on her, so she didn’t want to get too close to him?

Regardless of the reason, it was enough to make Gong Zeli upset.

He was filled with regret.

Why didn’t he treat Qiao Mianmian better in the past?

It was bad enough that he treated her badly...

Now that he knew the truth, he wanted to treat her well and make it up to her. But it seemed like he didn’t have a chance anymore.

It was so difficult to even be friends with her.

“There’s nothing to thank me for.” Gong Zeli was a little upset. He looked around and asked casually, “Where’s Ah Si? Isn’t he with you?”

“Mm, I’m having dinner with a friend. I just finished eating, and he’s coming to pick me up. He should be here soon.”
