Chapter 1384: What Are You Trying to Do?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“What are you trying to do?” Although the group of young girls around him looked weak and threatening, Mo Yesi still held Qiao Mianmian tightly in his arms.

The man’s aura was strong.

Even those older than him would feel pressured in front of him.

Not to mention a group of young girls.

The girls who mustered their courage to ask if she was really Qiao Mianmian were shocked.

The girl at the front was so frightened that her face turned pale. She bit her lip and looked like she was about to cry.

She looked at Qiao Mianmian and said weakly, “We’re Sister Qiao Mianmian’s fans. We want to ask, are you Sister Mianmian?”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

Her first reaction was to touch her mask.

Recognized?

Wasn’t she wearing a mask?

“You’re really Sister Mianmian.”

Seeing that she didn’t deny it, the female fan became excited. “Sister Mianmian, we’re all your fans, we like you so much. When we saw someone say that you were in this movie theater, we wondered if we could meet you by chance. We didn’t expect to really meet you.”

“Yes, Sister Mianmian, we all like you so much.”

“Sister Mianmian, I really like you too. You’re so beautiful, so many of our male classmates like you.”

Qiao Mianmian felt for her mask.

It wasn’t because of the mask.

“You saw someone say that I was at the cinema. Who said that?” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Qiao Mianmian didn’t deny it.

She didn’t expect her fans to be in the cinema.

She thought that all her fans on Weibo were haters.

She didn’t have many loyal fans.

Hence, she was rather surprised to meet a group of girls who claimed to be her fans.

“Someone took a picture of you and posted it on Weibo.” As the little girl spoke, she stole a glance at Mo Yesi standing beside Qiao Mianmian and immediately retracted her gaze in fear.

Sister Mianmian’s boyfriend was indeed a super hunk.

He just looked too cold and unapproachable.

They were afraid.

“Someone took a picture of us and posted it on Weibo?” Qiao Mianmian had no idea.

“That’s right, Sister Mianmian. Don’t you know?”

Qiao Mianmian shook her head.

“Sister Mianmian, can we take a picture with you?” With Mo Yesi by her side, the girls felt pressured and had to muster their courage to speak.

“Of course.” This was the first time Qiao Mianmian had seen so many fans looking for a picture with her. She was used to being defamed online, and it was rare to meet a few fans who really liked her, so she naturally fulfilled their requests.

“Really? Sister Mianmian, you’re so nice.”

They didn’t expect her to agree so readily. The female fans were overjoyed and quickly took out their phones.

Qiao Mianmian took off her mask.

She gently pushed Mo Yesi and gestured for him to let go. “I’ll take a picture with the fans.”

After knowing that the girls were fans, Mo Yesi let go of her.

Qiao Mianmian left his arms.

She could tell that these girls were a little afraid of Mo Yesi, so she walked to them and took the cell phone from one of them.
