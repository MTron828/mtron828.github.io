Chapter 1935: Qiao Mianmian Is a Good Girl

The viewership ratings were tabulated the next day. Not only was The Meaning of Traveling the number 1 in the viewership ratings for all variety programs in the same time period, but it was also number 1 in all the television stations on that day.

The viewership ratings for the third episode were much better than the first and second episodes.

The netizens’ discussions were also very high.

“Hahaha, I’m dying of laughter. The part where Zhan Bo went to dig lotus roots in his rain boots is really too funny. I suddenly realized that our brother is so beautiful that he can handle any style.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“I think the funniest part is feeding pigs. Han Yan almost cried from fear.”

“Hahaha, I also find the part about feeding pigs funny.”

“After reading the content of this episode, my impression of Qiao Mianmian has changed a lot. I realized that she’s the best at taking care of herself and is quite good at taking care of others.”

“Yeah, I think Qiao Mianmian is pretty good too. I really don’t know why so many people are slandering her online.”

“I feel like other than Qiao Mianmian, everyone else has been pampered since they were young and knows nothing.”

“I don’t think we can trust all the dirt online. Anyway, I’ve watched this episode, and I think Qiao Mianmian is a good girl. She’s quite hardworking and knows how to cook. In comparison, Qiao Anxin is the one who doesn’t know anything.”

“I heard that Qiao Mianmian doesn’t have a good relationship with her family. Mainly because her parents are very biased towards Qiao Anxin. Now it seems like this rumor might be true. One of the two sisters will do anything, and the other will do nothing. The one who won’t do anything is definitely the one who’s favored.”

“Now that you mention it, why do I feel a little sorry for Qiao Mianmian? My family is in the same situation. It’s really hard to be the unfavored one.”

Qiao Mianmian was a hot topic.

As “The Meaning of Traveling” trended, she also trended.

Qiao Mianmian had many scenes in the first episode, and they were all very popular.

Mo Yesi had invested in this episode to support Qiao Mianmian better.

The sponsor was her boyfriend.

Hence, apart from Shen Fei and Zhan Bo, Qiao Mianmian was the one who appeared the most in this episode.

Many celebrities knew that it was tiring to be on such a show, but they still fought to be on it. Because such shows attracted many fans. Even if they were covered in scandals, as long as they acted well, they could clear their names.

Qiao Mianmian had attracted a lot of fans because of her culinary skills.

The first episode had just ended and her reputation was already much better than before.

As she scrolled through the netizens’ praises for her on Weibo, she finally understood why so many popular artistes fought to participate in this program.

Joining it was too attractive.

For the next few days, the filming went very smoothly.

After the second week’s content was broadcasted, the viewership ratings reached a new high. Much higher than the first week.

As the head chef and manager of the restaurant, Qiao Mianmian became the hottest topic among all the guests.

Those who had initially objected to her being the manager and felt that she was unsuitable, after seeing her performance, retracted their prejudices against her.

“I’m going to slap myself in the face. Qiao Mianmian’s performance really exceeded my expectations. At first, I felt that she wasn’t suitable to be the manager as a newcomer. But after watching two episodes, I feel that she has managed the restaurant quite well.”
