Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

When she entered Weibo, she realized that she and Mo Yesi were actually at the top of the trending list.

She also saw that Linda messaged her.

Linda: [Mianmian, what do you think about your relationship with Chairman Mo? Some netizens have taken photos of you two, and Chairman Mo has been completely exposed. This matter is spreading like wildfire, you’d better respond.]

Qiao Mianmian never thought of exposing Mo Yesi.

Otherwise, she wouldn’t have made it public on Weibo.

She didn’t want others to know Mo Yesi’s identity, afraid that the rumors would affect him.

But since she was photographed, she had nothing to deny.

She thought for a while and sent a Weibo post.

Qiao Mianmian V: “Thank you for your concern. The person in the photo is me and my boyfriend. Didn’t you always want to know what ‘John Doe’ looks like? Now that you finally know, aren’t you too disappointed? (Naughty)”

Although many people said that the person in the photos was Qiao Mianmian and her boyfriend, Qiao Mianmian was wearing a mask and didn’t show her full face. It could be her or not.

Just as the netizens were wondering if it was her, they saw Qiao Mianmian’s Weibo post.

She actually admitted it.

The comment section exploded.

“Wow, it’s really Qiao Mianmian and her boyfriend. Her boyfriend is so handsome.”

“It’s really the John Doe. Gosh, I always thought he was at least 50 years old. He’s actually so handsome and young.”

“Nameless is finally showing his face. He’s a hundred times more handsome than I thought.”

“Not to mention anything else, just based on their looks, they’re a good match.”

“I didn’t expect Qiao Mianmian’s boyfriend to be so handsome. Those who spread rumors about him being an old man must be embarrassed.”

“Since Qiao Mianmian’s boyfriend is so handsome, why didn’t she publicize it sooner? She must know that he’s just playing with her and will break up with her sooner or later.”

“I don’t think Qiao Mianmian is worthy of her boyfriend. The man is rich, powerful, and good-looking, but what does she have? Besides being good-looking, she’s a newbie in the entertainment industry who doesn’t have any works. She’s far inferior to her boyfriend.”

“It’s done. The woman isn’t good enough for the man. This relationship won’t last.”

“The man’s eyes are watery, and his lips are peach-colored. He looks very attractive. I’m afraid Qiao Mianmian can’t keep him.”

“Why are you all jealous? I think they’re very compatible. They both have god-like looks. It’s especially pleasing to the eye.”

Qiao Mianmian’s comment section was polarized. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

On one hand, it was for her and Mo Yesi.

The other party felt that they wouldn’t last long and wanted to break up.

At the same time, the number of comments on Mo Yesi’s Weibo account skyrocketed.

His followers increased by more than 500,000 in less than ten minutes.

Almost all of them were women.

Because of Mo Yesi’s Weibo nickname and the previous rumors, many people really thought that he was at least 50 years old.

A short and fat old man with a beer belly.

But suddenly, the fat man’s true appearance was exposed.

Not only was he not old, but he was also handsome.

The fat old man had become a super-rich and handsome man.

The group of female netizens was all saying that they were smitten by the John Doe and wanted to be his wife.

Even though they knew that his girlfriend was Qiao Mianmian, the group of female netizens couldn’t stop themselves from being smitten by him.
