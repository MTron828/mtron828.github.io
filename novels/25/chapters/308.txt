Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“W-Wife?” The girl was stunned for a moment as her heart shattered.

Such an eligible hunk... but he’s taken?

The other girls seemed shocked and at a loss too. But on second thought, which woman wouldn’t want such a good man?

This man had probably been surrounded by women all his life.

How could he be the sort that remained a bachelor at his age?

They wondered what his wife must look like. Was she a beauty too?

There was so much more gentleness in his eyes when he mentioned his wife.

And he was personally picking flowers for her at the florist.

He must really love her.

The young girls were all envious.

But they weren’t thick-skinned enough to harass him further, knowing that he had a wife.

In the car. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Wei Zheng thought his Chairman Mo was really too charming.

No matter where he was, there’d always be a swarm of women attracted to him.

Well, that was why he felt that he should’ve been the one to get out of the car instead.

After all, Chairman Mo’s handsome face was too eye-catching.

“Hello, welcome.”

The florist came forward the moment Mo Yesi entered the store.

She was evidently stunned for a moment when her gaze landed on him.

The man was in a black top and black pants, his long legs standing out elegantly, and his facial features as perfect as a sculptor’s work of art. He was dressed rather simply, but the air he exuded was nevertheless classy.

The florist was lost in thoughts for a few seconds.

Until she heard him say, “Pick out some flowers for me that girls would like. It’s a gift.”

The florist’s heart rate picked up as she heard that captivating voice. “Mister, could I ask who it’s for? A colleague, friend, or...”

“My wife.”

There was some affection in his voice when he said that.

Just like the girls he’d bumped into outside, the florist also felt a little disheartened to find out that he was already someone else’s man.

“Oh, oh. Mister, please wait for a moment. I’ll pick out some flowers for you right away.”

The florist couldn’t help but steal a few more glances at him when she turned around.

This customer really was very handsome.

His looks, physique, charisma, taste in fashion, and all were top-notch.

He was simply the perfect partner to a woman.

The sort that mesmerized a whole population.

He was so handsome. And by the way he dressed, he seemed rather rich too. And he was so nice to his wife?

His wife must’ve saved the entire universe in her past life to be able to marry such a wonderful man.

Qiao Mianmian sent Mo Yesi another message when she and Jiang Luoli arrived at the restaurant.

Mo Yesi replied quickly, saying that he was arriving in a few minutes.

Both of them took their seats, and the waiter handed them the menu.

Qiao Mianmian flipped through it for a while and then handed it to Jiang Luoli. “Luo Luo, you decide.”

“We’re ordering it right now?” Jiang Luoli asked, “Are we not waiting for Prince Charming? Let’s order when he comes.”

“He’ll be here very soon. You can order a few items you like first.” Qiao Mianmian patted her own chest as she smiled and said, “Pick anything you want. You don’t have to consider the price.”
