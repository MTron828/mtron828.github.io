“Don’t be like this, ok?” Mo Yesi asked willfully, smiling in amusement.

Qiao Mianmian felt a little annoyed at the man’s mocking smile. Her temper rose and she bit her lip, glaring at him fiercely. “Don’t touch me as you wish again!”

He would always kiss her until she almost fainted.

She couldn’t handle such passionate and intense kisses.

Mo Yesi chuckled lowly and frowned slightly. He put on a distressed expression and said, “But when I see you, I just want to hug you, kiss you, and touch you as I wish. Tell me, what can I do?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“Baby.” The man leaned over and snuggled his warm lips to her earlobes. His low voice was incredibly sexy and teasing. “I’ll have to blame you for being too attractive to me. I can’t control myself around you. I know you’re not yet accustomed to our relationship, but you have to be clear about one thing.

“We’re already husband and wife. You’re my wife, the woman I’ll spend the rest of my life with. Who else could I be affectionate with? Furthermore, I’m being like this because I like you.”

He grinned when he saw the young girl blush fiercely in his arms and chuckled again. “You don’t like me being like this? But you didn’t seem to resist the kiss just now.”

Qiao Mianmian’s blush deepened.

She didn’t know how to retaliate.

“But you can’t do this regardless of the situation.” She bit her lip and finally retorted softly after a while.

“What do you mean, you don’t like me being like this here? Then, should we go somewhere else?”

She was speechless.

She didn’t mean it like this!

This man was deliberately twisting her words!

Despicable!

Qiao Mianmian felt like she couldn’t win over him and simply gave up. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The black Bentley drove slowly on the campus road.

Qiao Mianmian frowned when she saw that they were almost leaving the school compound. “Mo Yesi, I don’t need to go to the hospital. Can you let me get off here?”

Her fall was not serious at all.

There were only some minor scratches and she would be fine after buying some disinfectant at the pharmacy.

She didn’t need to go to the hospital at all.

Mo Yesi glanced down at her. “I have the final say about its necessity.”

Qiao Mianmian went quiet.

How could he be so domineering!

She frowned even tighter. “It’s really not necessary! I can just go to the pharmacy and buy some medicine to apply on it. You should go to work, I don’t want to delay your work because of such a small thing.”

After all, he was the big boss.

He was probably very busy.

Qiao Mianmian really did not think that he would come to school for her.

Mo Yesi squeezed her jaw and stared at her with his dark eyes for a while before whispering, “Your business is not a trivial matter. No job is as important as you.”

Thump, thump!

At this moment, Qiao Mianmian could hear the sound of her heart pounding against her chest.

Her brain seemed to turn blank and her whole person, even her soul, seemed to be sucked into his dark abyss-like eyes.

“Be good and obediently follow me to the hospital, Mianmian. Do not make me worry about you, okay?” The man’s warm, dry hands caressed her tender cheeks as adoration shone in his eyes.

As if bewitched, Qiao Mianmian nodded dumbly.
