Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

But this fatigue was mixed with happiness.

Her wedding was done in the way she liked.

The island, the flowers, the band, the people she loved, her family and friends.

The wedding she’d fantasized about.

It was her dream wedding.

From her husband, Mo Yesi, to a real wedding.

Anything she wanted.

This man had done everything he could to help her achieve it.

A warm and familiar scent surrounded her from behind. A low and husky voice landed by her ear, gentle and lingering. “Baby, what are you thinking about?”

Qiao Mianmian leaned into his warm and firm arms and said lazily, “I’m thinking that I’m very lucky.”

“Mm?”

“I’m lucky to have married you.” Qiao Mianmian narrowed her eyes. From the first time they met, everything that happened in the past was like a movie replay. It was all

sweet and blissful. She said sweetly, “Mo Yesi, I think the luckiest thing in my life is to marry you and become your wife.”

The arms around her waist tightened.

Qiao Mianmian felt it and smiled. “If there’s really a next life, | hope to marry you in the next life too.”

“Mianmian…”

The man tightened his grip around her waist and gently pulled her towards him. His deep eyes were burning with passion. “What you said just now, was it true?” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qiao Mianmian looked up at the man’s handsome face and reached out to touch his especially beautiful and charming deep eyes. “Mm, I mean it. Mo Yesi, I really hope to

marry you in the next lifetime.

“If you’re still willing to have me for the rest of your life.”

“I’m willing.”

The man held her hand tightly, lowered his head, and kissed her slender and fair fingertips. He pressed her hand tightly against his face and said hoarsely, “If you’re willing

to marry me in the next lifetime, of course, I’m willing to have you.

“I only want you.”

Besides her, he didn’t want anyone else.

Mo Yesi only wanted Qiao Mianmian.

“Mo Yesi…” The man’s gaze was too passionate. Qiao Mianmian felt as if she was melting into his eyes.

Qiao Mianmian lay on the bed, exhausted.

Mo Yesi was the one who carried her out of the shower.

“Baby, are you sleepy?” Mo Yesi hugged the petite girl beside him and stroked her head. “Sleep, then.”

He couldn’t help it.

He knew that she was tired, but he couldn’t control himself…

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian sounded tired. “Mo Yesi, y-you haven’t sung for me.”

Mo Yesi had developed a habit of singing to coax her to sleep.

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t used to not listening to him sing.

“Alright. Which song do you want to hear today, Baby?”

“I want to hear that song.”

“Alright.” The man hummed softly and patted the back of the little girl in his arms, coaxing her like he was coaxing a child to sleep.

Soon, Qiao Mianmian fell asleep..
