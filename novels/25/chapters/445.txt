Chapter 447: Someone Was Trying to Take Chairman Mo’s Place?!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Initially, they didn’t quite respect him. They thought he got the Chairman’s post because of his family backing but had no substance at all.

But as time went by...

Nobody dared to underestimate him anymore after getting thrashed a few times.

The meeting ended 20 minutes later.

Mo Yesi got up and left the meeting room with a stern expression.

With his departure, everyone heaved a sigh of relief.

The tension in the air immediately vanished.

...

Back at the office.

Wei Zheng placed the well-documented minutes from the meeting onto his desk. He was just about to leave when Mo Yesi called him back.

“Chairman Mo?”

He turned around and waited readily for Boss’s next instruction.

Mo Yesi was reading the text message from Qiao Mianmian again. His expression got even darker.

He looked up at Wei Zheng and said, “I have another meeting, I can’t leave. Go to the school on my behalf.”

He paused before adding, “Help me check something out.”

“Chairman Mo, you mean...”

“Someone gave Mianmian 999 roses. Find out who it was. And then report that person’s background to me.”

Wei Zheng was left speechless.

So, Chairman Mo’s sudden change in mood was because of this?

Someone was trying to take Chairman Mo’s place?!

Wei Zheng was extremely curious. He wanted to get to the bottom of this as soon as possible.

Who was this fool?

Did he not know how possessive Chairman Mo was?

“Yes, Chairman Mo.”

Wei Zheng left once he received his task.

Mo Yesi looked at Qiao Mianmian’s message once more. After a while, he finally replied unhappily: [No.]

Qiao Mianmian’s message to him read: [You sent me 999 pink roses?]

There was even an attached image of the flowers.

In the image, the tender pink roses had taken up the entire frame and were very eye-catching!

Qiao Mianmian responded immediately: [It wasn’t you?! Who could it be?]

Mo Yesi looked even more awful as he read this reply.

He wanted to know who was foolish enough to pit themselves against him too.

Sending such a huge bouquet of roses to his wife.

It got even worse after Mo Yesi checked out the symbolism of 999 roses online. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“What does it mean to send a girl 999 pink roses?”

Mo Yesi saw thousands of search results.

He looked through the top few very seriously.

One netizen replied: Pink roses symbolize first love, romance, a relationship that will never be forgotten. They suit girls who look sweet and are looking for pure and innocent love. One rose symbolizes “you’re my only one,” two roses mean “the world only has the both of us,” three roses mean “I love you,” nine roses mean “forever and ever.” If there are 999 roses, it means that the man really loves you and wants to spend the rest of his life with only you. If it’s 1314 roses, it means he’ll love you for the rest of eternity.

Another netizen wrote: Pink roses are less striking and appear warmer and more tender than red roses. They don’t look as eye-catching and loud as red roses, so it symbolizes a love that’s not as passionate, but sweeter, gentler, and warmer.
