Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Mo Yunchen thought of that gentle woman, and his eyes filled with guilt and pain. His eyes reddened as he said hoarsely, ‘I let Wangiu down. I wanted to make it up to her, but she didn’t want anything. I went to look for her, but she said she hoped that I could leave her life completely and not appear in front

of her.

“I didn’t know she was pregnant, and I didn’t know she suffered so much..” Mo Yunchen’s voice got lower and lower, and the guilt and pain in his eyes got stronger. “I let her down, I let her down...” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Tang Ya looked at him coldly. What’s the point of saying this now?”

‘It’s useless.” Mo Yunchen looked up and said bitterly, “I couldn’t make it up to her back then, so what can I do now? She’s such a proud person, she’s not willing to accept any of my compensation.

“But, I want to know how she is now. Is she... alright?” Mo Yunchen asked cautiously. He clenched his fists nervously.

Actually, Tang Ya’s words had already made him guess something.

But he didn’t want to believe it.

He felt that he must have misunderstood.

Tang Wangi

was definitely fine.

“Is she alright?” Tang Ya repeated his words with a sneer. “If I hadn’t met you, she would be fine now. But God didn’t want her to live well and arranged for you to harm her.”

Mo Yunchen’s heart sank.

‘Tang Ya looked into his guilt- and pain-filled eyes and said word by word, “Mo Yunchen, she has been depressed for more than 20 years. She hasn’t been happy all this time. She died in the hospital bed because she was sick and unwilling to receive treatment.

“Do you know that she was still saying your name the moment before she died? What do you do to make her unable to forget you even t her deathbed? What did you do to make her love you wholeheartedly even after you let her down?”

Mo Yunchen’s tears fell. “Wanqiu, why are you so silly..”

“Yes, why is she so silly?” Tang Ya’s eyes were also moist. “You’re just a man. So what if you’re gone? There are so many men in the world. Why was she so silly and suicidal?”

‘Was love that important?

‘The moment Mo Yunchen heard that Tang Wanqiu was dead, he held his chest and staggered two steps back.

“Wanqiu..” He called her name, his hoarse voice full of pain.

‘Tang Ya looked at him and said coldly, “Mo Yunchen, you don’t have to pretend to care about her. I’m not interested in watching you perform. If you really feel sorry for her and want to make it up to her, then do it!”

Mo Yunchen looked up with bloodshot eyes. “What do you want me to do?”

“My mom died of depression because of you. She wasn’t even happy, so what right do you have to be happy? Firstly, I want you to divorce your wife immediately and never marry again! Secondly.”

Tang Ya slowly took out a box from her bag and took out something that looked like a pill. “Then, eat this, and I’ll believe that you really want to make it up to her. As long as you do as I say, I’ll return your granddaughter to the Mo family unscathed..”
