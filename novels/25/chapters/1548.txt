Chapter 1549: She Seemed to Have Ignored Her Husband

Mo Yesi was stunned. “I’m afraid. I’m very afraid. You’re right. I have to treat you well to prevent the Mo Corporation from going bankrupt.

“I’ll be good to you for the rest of my life and pamper you.

“I can’t let the Mo Corporation go bankrupt in my hands. Then, I’ll be the sinner of the Mo family.”

Qiao Mianmian seemed so serious, and so was the man.

But they were actually joking.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but laugh. “It’s good that you know. I have a brother now. If you don’t treat me well, I’ll get him to beat you up.”

“Then, I might have to disappoint you.”

“Mm?”

“What you said will never happen.” Mo Yesi hugged his wife tightly and kissed her on the forehead. “Mianmian, I’ll love you for the rest of my life. You’re my baby for the rest of my life. If I let you down one day, I won’t have a good ending.”

Qiao Mianmian immediately covered his mouth.

She bit her lip and glared at him. “Why are you suddenly saying this? What do you mean by a bad ending? I want you to live well for the rest of your life.”

The man chuckled and took her hand away, placing it on his handsome face. “A man who let his wife down shouldn’t have a good ending. If I haven’t done anything wrong, I’m not afraid of ghosts knocking on my door. I’m not even afraid of taking the oath, what are you afraid of?”

“You can’t say that.” Qiao Mianmian pinched his cheek. “Anyway, don’t say such things anymore. I don’t like it.”

“Yes, ma’am.”

Qiao Mianmian could hear his heartbeat.

Its steady sound was like a hypnotic spell. As she listened to it, her eyelids became heavy.

“Mo Yesi, I’m so sleepy.” Qiao Mianmian yawned and said lazily, “I want to sleep.”

“Mm, go to sleep.” Knowing that she was going to wake up early tomorrow, Mo Yesi wanted her to have a good sleep.

He moved his body and turned to protect her. He also raised his arm so that she could sleep more comfortably.

He placed his other hand on the top of her head as if protecting her in his arms. “Have a good dream, Baby.”

Qiao Mianmian yawned again and said softly, “Then... good night.”

“Good night.”

The next day, Qiao Mianmian flew back to F City.

The shoot continued.

Xue Shiya paid the contract signing fee for the first commercial. When Qiao Mianmian received the money, she realized that it was much more expensive than the contract fee.

She called Linda to ask what was going on.

“Because the facial mask you endorsed is selling especially well. It’s in short supply now. Xue Shiya said that the extra money is the bonus. I also told the company that the bonus won’t be taken out. I’ll send it all to you.

“Although I know you’re not short of money now...”

“Sister Xie, I’m short of money now.” Qiao Mianmian didn’t wait for Linda to finish before saying, “No one will complain about having too much money. So, if there’s any suitable endorsement, you can help me take it. I really don’t mind my schedule being full every day. I especially like this kind of fulfilling life.”

Linda was speechless.

Qiao Mianmian realized that she seemed to have forgotten something.

She thought for a while before remembering.

She seemed to have forgotten about her husband.
