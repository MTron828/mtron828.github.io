Chapter 2675: Luoli, It’s Been Hard on You

In any case, no matter how she gave birth, she wouldn’t feel any better.

Jiang Luoli smiled and shook her head. “It doesn’t hurt. It only hurt a little at first, but it doesn’t hurt anymore now. Don’t cry, it’s really not as scary as you think. You’ll know in the future.”

“It really doesn’t hurt?”

“Mm, it doesn’t hurt. Even if it does hurt a little, it’s nothing. It’s bearable. Alright, don’t cry. Everyone’s happy. Have you seen Yueyue?”

“Yueyue?”

“Mm, my little princess. Yueyue. It’s the Yue that Ping An is happy about. This is her nickname. Grandma and Shixiu will find a Fengshui master to calculate it before naming her properly.”

A prestigious family like the Mo’s naturally couldn’t name their children casually.

She also had a Fengshui master calculate when Mo Shixiu and Mo Yesi were born.

Qiao Mianmian knew this, too.

She nodded and said with a smile, “Yueyue. Mm, this nickname is pretty good. I haven’t seen her yet, I wanted to see you first.”

“Then, go take a look.” Jiang Luoli’s eyes couldn’t help but exude motherly gentleness when she talked about her daughter. “Yueyue is so beautiful, like a little angel. I can’t believe I gave birth to such a beautiful child.”

“Baby is beautiful because her parents have good genes. Our Yueyue is indeed a cute little angel, but I think her mom is the most beautiful.” Mo Shixiu walked over and squatted by the bed. He gently held Jiang Luoli’s hand and kissed it gently. His dark and cold eyes were full of love and affection.

“You’re the greatest.” Mo Shixiu kissed the back of Jiang Luoli’s hand. He looked up and touched her cheek. “Luoli, it’s been hard on you. Thank you for giving birth to such a cute baby for me.

“Thank you for giving me such a happy family.”

His eyes were full of love. He heard what Jiang Luoli said to Qiao Mianmian.

Actually, Jiang Luoli’s delivery wasn’t as easy as she said.

Although it didn’t hurt, the anesthesia only played a third of the role because of her constitution.

The entire process was painful.

She told Qiao Mianmian that it didn’t hurt because she didn’t want her best friend to feel bad.

Just like how she clenched her teeth and didn’t make a sound despite the pain.

Back then, she didn’t want him to worry.

She always considered others, but often neglected herself.

Mo Shixiu doted on her even more.

He wanted her to scream when she was in pain. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He hoped that she would tell him the truth.

She was his wife.

She could tell him everything.

Jiang Luoli met his affectionate gaze and felt her heart soften. She recalled that when she and the baby were pushed out of the delivery room, Mo Shixiu walked past the baby and held her hand with red eyes.

Men didn’t cry easily.

That was the first time she saw Mo Shixiu cry.

It was the first time she saw fear in his eyes..
