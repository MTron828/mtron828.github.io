Chapter 1668: I Heard Shen Xin Is Transferring

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The Mo Family had invited many prominent figures in Yuncheng City, and Qiao Chen had also invited many classmates. They were all friends of his.

The day he received the invitation, his classmates found out that Qiao Chen was actually the Young Master of the Mo Family.

But his surname was Qiao.

Moreover, Qiao Chen didn’t seem like a rich young master in any aspect. As a result, he was very popular among girls in the school, and many boys in the school rejected him.

“Qiao Chen, are you really the Young Master of the Mo Family?” A boy who was especially close to Qiao Chen asked in shock.

He and Qiao Chen had been classmates for a few years and had a good relationship, but he never saw Qiao Chen as a rich young master.

Of course, Qiao Chen was good-looking, charismatic, and fair.

He did look like a pampered young master.

But Qiao Chen was just good-looking.

From his performance all these years, his family didn’t have much money. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

If he was the Young Master of a rich family, he wouldn’t be dressed so ordinarily.

But the banquet was held in the Mo Family.

If he wasn’t the Young Master of the Mo Family, he couldn’t possibly be impersonating him.

Qiao Chen smiled at him. “Mm.”

“But, but you used to...”

Qiao Chen smiled again. “I only found out recently.”

The classmate was stunned. “Only recently...”

He quickly swallowed his words.

What else could it be?

It could only be that he hadn’t grown up in the family.

Now, the Mo Family must have found him.

“I really didn’t expect it.” The classmate looked at him and muttered, “My classmate and good friend is actually the Young Master of the Mo Family. Our class has Miss Shen, and now there’s Young Master Mo.”

The classmate looked up at Qiao Chen and hesitated.

“Qiao Chen, do you know something?” the student asked after a few seconds of silence.

Qiao Chen looked at him. “What is it?”

“It’s about Shen Xin.” Knowing that Qiao Chen didn’t like Shen Xin that much, he paused for a while before continuing, “I heard that she’s transferring schools. You don’t have to worry about her harassing you anymore.”

Actually, this classmate didn’t hate Shen Xin.

On the contrary, he felt that she was a good girl.

As the daughter of the Shen Family, she wasn’t as arrogant and unreasonable as other rich ladies.

Shen Xin didn’t put on airs in front of them.

Moreover, Shen Xin had good grades, good looks, and a good family background.

Such a girl was a goddess in their eyes.

When they found out that Shen Xin was pursuing Qiao Chen, they thought that he would definitely agree.

After all, Shen Xin was so eligible and took the initiative to pursue him. Which boy could resist such a girl?

But Qiao Chen unexpectedly rejected her.

And Shen Xin had unexpectedly pursued him for three whole years.

Qiao Chen seemed uninterested in her.

He wondered how he would feel now that Shen Xin was leaving.
