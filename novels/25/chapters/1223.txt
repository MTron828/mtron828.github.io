Chapter 1224: But This Isn’t a Birthmark

“Yes, Madam.”

Madam Bai then brought Shen Rou and Qiao Anxin upstairs to change.

Qiao Mianmian felt that something was wrong as she watched Shen Rou and Qiao Anxin leave.

She saw Qiao Anxin pour the wine on herself.

Obviously, she wanted to dirty that dress.

Shen Rou seemed to know about this too.

What were they trying to do?

Although Qiao Mianmian didn’t know what they were plotting, she could feel that their target was Madam Bai.

They seemed to be luring Madam Bai away.

...

Upstairs.

Madam Bai brought Shen Rou and Qiao Anxin to a guest room and brought out a set of clothes she rarely wore.

She handed the clothes to Shen Rou and was about to leave.

“You can go downstairs after changing. You can ask the servants if you need anything.”

In other words, she didn’t want to see her again. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Aunt Bai, sorry to trouble you.”

Shen Rou handed it to Qiao Anxin. “Change into it quickly.”

“Mm, thank you, Madam Bai.” Qiao Anxin could tell that Madam Bai didn’t like her. If it wasn’t for Shen Rou, Madam Bai wouldn’t have bothered with her.

She thought that Qiao Mianmian must have said something bad about her in front of Madam Bai.

That was why Madam Bai didn’t like her.

Did that slut think this was of any use?

Soon, Madam Bai’s attitude towards her would change.

By then, she, Qiao Anxin, would be the favorite of the Bai family. At that time, Qiao Mianmian would be nothing!

Madam Bai was extremely unhappy with Qiao Anxin because of Qiao Mianmian, so she didn’t respond to her. She just glanced at her calmly and turned to leave.

Just as she reached the door, she heard Shen Rou’s shocked voice from behind. “Anxin, you actually have a red birthmark here, and it’s in such a special place.”

Madam Bai stopped in her tracks.

Behind her, Qiao Anxin saw Madam Bai standing at the door and smiled. “Yes, but this isn’t a birthmark.”

“If it’s not a birthmark, what is it?”

“I heard from my dad that this birthmark was branded by my biological mother. She must be afraid of mistaking the child in the future, so she branded it as a mark.”

“What?” Shen Rou looked shocked. “You mean your mother isn’t your biological mother?”

“Yes, actually, my dad isn’t my biological father,” Qiao Anxin said with a low voice. She glanced at Madam Bai standing at the door and pretended to be sad. “They’re my adoptive parents. My real biological parents... I don’t know where they are now.”

“What’s going on? I’ve never heard you mention it before.”

“I’m not sure. It seems like my dad’s boss was in trouble back then and couldn’t bring me along. Hence, they entrusted me to my adoptive father. My adoptive father is also very loyal to my boss. He has always treated me like his biological daughter.

“So, I think it’s fine even if I don’t know who my biological parents are for the rest of my life. At least my adoptive parents are good to me. I’m not worse off than the children who are with their biological parents.”
