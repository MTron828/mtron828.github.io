Chapter 1737: She’s Still on the Hot Search

In any case, it was just a small sum of money to the Mo Corporation.

Compared to Young Madam, that amount of money was nothing.

If they canceled the cooperation, the Shangguan Family would definitely be the one heavily affected.

They had the intention to open up the market in Yuncheng City. They wanted to focus their future development on Yuncheng City. Cooperating with the Mo Family’s Mo Corporation was very important to the Shangguan Family.

The Mo Corporation was the boss of Yuncheng City.

If they could have a fixed cooperation with them, it meant that the Shangguan Family could stabilize in Yuncheng City.

This cooperation was also negotiated by the Shangguan Family for a long time.

Unfortunately, Shangguan Qing ruined it.

...

The next day, Qiao Mianmian woke up and found that she was still on the trending list.

# Qiao Mianmian’s third-party # was still firmly in third place on the trending list.

The first place was a discussion about the next episode of “The Meaning of Traveling” and the choice of guests.

In second place was Shen Fei’s topic of “The Meaning of Traveling”.

Qiao Mianmian was third.

Qiao Mianmian had heard from Linda that Shen Fei might be going.

She was a little happy to see her trending topics.

She still didn’t know who the other guests would be.

If they didn’t know each other, they would feel uncomfortable.

She didn’t really know Shen Fei.

But at least they’d met before during the interview, and Shen Fei had even spoken up for her. If Shen Fei was really going, Qiao Mianmian would get to know her better.

She had just finished reading the hot searches when Linda called. She said that the contract was officially finalized and that she had to discuss some details with her in person.

Linda hung up.

Qiao Mianmian quickly got up to prepare.

...

An hour later, she arrived at her appointment with Linda and followed the waiter to a private room.

She knocked on the door and saw Linda sitting inside. “Sister Xie.”

“You’re here.” Linda invited her to sit down and handed her a document. “This is the contract. Take a look. I’ve already looked through it for you. The pay is pretty good, and there aren’t any other problems.

“If you think it’s OK, sign it.”

Qiao Mianmian sat down and took the contract. She casually flipped through two pages, and when she saw the pay section, her browsing speed slowed down.

She read each word carefully.

After a while, she looked up. “Sister Xie, I’ve finished reading it. I have no objections to this contract.”

With Linda around, Qiao Mianmian wouldn’t worry about the contract being a scam.

Hence, she only paid attention to her pay.

Qiao Mianmian was pretty satisfied with the 5 million yuan remuneration.

She was only filming for a month, and she was a newbie, so her pay wasn’t low. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Moreover, to be able to be on such a show, the pay was secondary. Many artistes were willing to lower their prices to appear on this show. To be able to appear on a variety show with such good ratings, even if they received nothing, many people were willing.

Linda nodded. “Since you don’t have any objections, sign it. I’ll be more at ease if you sign the contract as soon as possible.”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t dawdle and signed her name.
