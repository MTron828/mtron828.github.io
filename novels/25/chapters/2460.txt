Chapter 2463: Untitled

“Now, she’s quietly making big news. It’s a slap to the face for the rumors.”

“It’s really not simple to snatch business opportunities from the Mo Corporation. I wonder what Chairman Mo is thinking now. Is he regretting choosing the wrong person and ending up in this stalemate with the Shen Corporation over a small celebrity? Now that Shen Rou has snatched many of the Mo Corporation’s partnerships and invited Henry Zhou to fight against them, she’s definitely targeting the Mo Corporation. Although the Mo Corporation is very powerful, since the Shen Corporation can snatch business opportunities from them, it shows that the Shen Corporation is not to be underestimated. In the future… the Mo Corporation won’t have a good life.”

“If I were Mo Yesi, I’d definitely choose Shen Rou. She grew up with him, and the two families are long-time friends. Their looks and talents are very compatible. If the two of them get together, they’ll definitely form a strong alliance. It’s indeed much better than being with a celebrity. To be honest, celebrities nowadays earn pretty good money, but that amount isn’t much to the Mo family. Although Qiao Mianmian has a good background, she’s still different from Shen Rou, who grew up in a prestigious family.

“A ‘rich young lady’ like Qiao Mianmian is definitely different from a real rich young lady. Moreover, the Bai family has Bai Yusheng. The Bai Corporation will definitely be handed over to him in the future. Qiao Mianmian only has a good identity and won’t get many benefits. But Shen Rou is different. She officially took over the Shen Corporation. Her net worth isn’t something a ‘fake young lady’ like Qiao Mianmian can compare to.”

“I think Mo Yesi will regret it.”

“I think Mo Yesi will regret it too.”

“Mo Yesi will definitely regret it.”

“Waiting for Mo Yesi to regret+10086.”

A group of people appeared out of nowhere.

Suddenly, similar comments appeared on every popular Weibo post related to Shen Rou.

“Shen Rou is a hundred times better than Qiao Mianmian.”

“Shen Rou is the real daughter.”

“Qiao Mianmian is just a fake heiress.”

Also—

“Mo Yesi must regret choosing Qiao Mianmian now. They definitely won’t last long and will break up sooner or later.”

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t too affected by the comments.

This wasn’t the first time she saw such comments about her relationship with Mo Yesi.

When their relationship exploded on Weibo, many people predicted that they would break up.

Qiao Mianmian was already numb to it.

She was in the entertainment industry and was often on the hot searches. Seeing so many people praising Shen Rou and belittling her and Mo Yesi, she quickly understood that it was the Internet Water Army.

It wasn’t hard to guess who hired these fake commentators.

Qiao Mianmian took it as a joke.

It was really surprising that Shen Rou could invite Henry Zhou this time.

She also did steal a few of the Mo Corporation’s partnerships.

But the outcome hadn’t been decided.

As for the partners who were snatched away, Mo Yesi had told her that they weren’t important. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

It wouldn’t be a loss to the Mo Corporation if the Shen Corporation took them away.

It was like plucking a strand of fur from a cat. It didn’t hurt at all.

The Shen Corporation didn’t have the ability to snatch cooperations that really affected the Mo Corporation.

But now…

It was as if the Mo Corporation had suffered a huge loss.
