Chapter 677: Chairman Mo... What’s Going On?

“Wow, Director Bai is here. I think I saw him. I have a feeling that something good is going to happen.”

“Director Bai is here?”

The crowd turned around and saw Bai Yusheng walking towards them.

As he walked, he looked at Qiao Mianmian.

Then, he stopped in his tracks.

Everyone was waiting to see what he would do next.

Would he get into a fight out of jealousy?

Or he could change the male lead.

Not far away.

Bai Yusheng narrowed his eyes and stared at the handsome couple under the tree for a while. A malicious smile flashed past his eyes. He took out his cell phone, opened WeChat, and replied to Mo Yesi’s message.

Mo Yesi had asked him what Qiao Mianmian was doing, but he hadn’t replied.

Now, he felt that he could.

Bai Yusheng: [Chairman Mo, I saw your precious. Are you sure you want to know what she’s doing?]

A few seconds later, Mo Yesi replied: [What do you mean?]

Bai Yusheng smiled. [Nothing much, I just feel that your little darling is rather popular.]

Mo Yesi: [What’s she doing?]

Bai Yusheng looked up at the tree again, and the playful look in his eyes deepened. [Why don’t I take a picture for you?]

This time, without waiting for Mo Yesi’s reply, he took a picture from the right angle and sent it to him.

Then, he sent a message: [The male lead of our film crew, how is he? Isn’t he handsome? He’s already won the Best Actor Award at such a young age. He’s a very hardworking and capable young actor. He’s considered very outstanding among his peers. He’s about the same age as your little darling. There will probably be a lot of topics among young people.]

Mo Corporation building.

In the Chairman’s office.

Mo Yesi received a photo from Bai Yusheng and opened it to take a look. His originally expressionless face was instantly covered with a layer of haze.

He stared at the man beside Qiao Mianmian for a full minute, then his expression darkened.

At this moment, Wei Zheng knocked on the door and entered.

“Chairman Mo, everything is ready. The meeting will officially begin in 10 minutes.” Wei Zheng had just finished organizing the documents for the meeting and was walking over from the meeting room.

As soon as he entered the office, he felt that the atmosphere wasn’t right.

He looked up and was shocked by Mo Yesi’s dark expression.

Chairman Mo... what was going on?

Wasn’t he alright just now?

Why did he look so awful all of a sudden? Who angered him?

“Wei Zheng.” Mo Yesi tightened his grip on his cell phone and looked at the photo again. He resisted the urge to throw his cell phone away and looked up at him. “Check the latest flight to F City.”

“F City?”

Wei Zheng was stunned for a moment. “Chairman Mo, we don’t have a flight to F City scheduled.”

Mo Yesi glared at him. “You can’t go without a schedule?”

“Huh?”

Wei Zheng suddenly recalled that Young Madam was in City F.

Look at him.

He actually forgot about it.

He was wondering why Chairman Mo suddenly wanted to go to City F.

Young Madam left yesterday.

It had only been a day, and the Chairman already couldn’t hold back his longing for her.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates
