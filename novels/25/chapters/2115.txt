Chapter 2118: He’ll Be the First to Teach Her a Lesson!

When Qiao Anxin seduced Su Ze, she was always wearing heavy makeup, just like now.

Hence, her intentions were easy to recognize.

Moreover, her eyes were still glued to Mo Yesi. After coming down from upstairs, she had been staring at Mo Yesi without looking at anyone else.

It was obvious.

Father Qiao probably saw it, too.

That was why he insisted that Qiao Anxin go upstairs to change.

Only his silly sister seemed to know nothing.

Qiao Chen didn’t know what to say about her.

She’d already suffered at Qiao Anxin’s hands once and was still so magnanimous.

“Sister, Qiao Anxin definitely has feelings for Brother-in-law. You have to be careful. Brother-in-law is a hundred times better than Su Ze. If she could make Su Ze fall for her back then, I don’t believe she can’t do the same to Brother-in-law.

“Didn’t you see that her eyes were glued to Brother-in-law just now? She kept staring at him. How shameless!” Qiao Chen’s eyes were filled with disgust. He hated Qiao Anxin to the core.

This time, if Qiao Anxin dared to steal his sister’s man again, he would be the first to teach her a lesson!

In the past, he couldn’t even protect himself, let alone others.

Hence, he couldn’t do many things.

But it was different now.

He now had the ability to protect the people he cared about.

Hence, he would never allow Qiao Anxin to hurt his sister again.

Qiao Mianmian blinked. “You’re talking about this? I know.”

“You know?” Qiao Chen was stunned.

“Mm, of course I know.” Qiao Mianmian pursed her lips. “Your sister isn’t a fool. How can’t I even tell such an obvious thing? I’ve long known Qiao Anxin’s feelings for your brother-in-law.”

Qiao Chen was speechless.

Alright, he took back his previous opinion.

It seemed like his sister wasn’t that silly.

He relaxed a little and said, “It’s good that you know. I was afraid you didn’t know anything.”

“Don’t worry. Your brother-in-law doesn’t have such bad taste. He’s not someone who can’t resist temptation like Su Ze. Qiao Anxin’s tricks are useless on your brother-in-law.” Qiao Mianmian was very satisfied with her husband.

When she was betrayed by Su Ze, she thought men were all the same. She felt that there was no good man in this world.

But Mo Yesi changed her mind.

She was willing to trust him.

She wasn’t afraid of the same thing happening.

She felt that even if the whole world betrayed her, she firmly believed that Qiao Chen and Mo Yesi wouldn’t.

They were the two people she trusted the most.

If they betrayed her, she probably wouldn’t trust anyone for the rest of her life.

Qiao Chen looked at her disapprovingly and reminded her. “Of course, I know that Brother-in-law wouldn’t fall for her. But Qiao Anxin has no bottom line. Who knows what she’ll do? You can’t let your guard down, anyway.”

“I know.” Qiao Mianmian looked at the youth in front of her who was looking at her with concern. She tiptoed and patted his head. “You also have to be careful. You have to take good care of yourself and not fall into danger.”Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
