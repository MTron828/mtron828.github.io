Chapter 2133: I’ll Make Sure You Die a Horrible Death

He held the broken bottle and glared at Lin Huizhen and Qiao Anxin.

“Scram!”

Qiao Anxin took a step back.

She looked at the furious Father Qiao, then at Qiao Mianmian and Qiao Chen. She suddenly sneered. “Qiao Mianmian, is this what you wanted to see?”

Qiao Mianmian looked at her coldly. “It was your mom who caused all this. She let Dad down. We just wanted him to know the truth.”

“Qiao Mianmian, you’ll die a terrible death!” Qiao Anxin gritted her teeth and cursed. “You’ll definitely die a terrible death.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she felt as if she was being targeted by a death god.

A chill spread throughout her body.

She looked up and met Mo Yesi’s cold gaze.

The man’s dark and cold eyes seemed to freeze her.

Afraid, she didn’t dare to say another word.

She felt that if she did, Mo Yesi would destroy her.

“If you dare to hurt her at all, I’ll make sure you die a horrible death.” Mo Yesi’s voice was so cold it seemed like it came from hell.

Qiao Anxin’s body stiffened and her face went pale.

…

After a while, Qiao Anxin and Lin Huizhen left the Qiao Residence.

As soon as they did, Father Qiao slumped on the chair as if all his energy had been drained.

His face was pale and his lips were trembling.

He hadn’t calmed down.

This incident was a huge blow to Father Qiao.

He couldn’t accept it.

He’d been betrayed by the person he trusted the most.

And in such a way.

No man could accept this.

Father Qiao looked a little haggard because of his poor health. After being dealt such a blow, his face grew even paler. He looked at least five years older.

He sat on the chair with a pale face and a heaving chest.

“Dad, are you alright?” Qiao Mianmian asked worriedly.

She felt that Qiao Chen was too impulsive.

Even if they wanted to tell Father Qiao that Lin Huizhen had a man outside, they shouldn’t have chosen this time.

And not so directly.

This blow was too much for Father Qiao. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Qiao Mianmian was worried that his body wouldn’t be able to take it.

Father Qiao looked terrible.

“When did you learn about this?” Father Qiao didn’t answer her but asked another question. “Where did you get those photos?”

Qiao Mianmian turned to look at Qiao Chen.

“Dad, I was the one who found the photos.” Qiao Chen didn’t hide it and told him what happened. “Qiao Anxin framed Sister and has been fabricating negative rumors about Sister online. In order to retaliate, I used some means to check the things in her cell phone.

“I also checked on Aunt Lin and found out that she has a close relationship with the man in the photos.

“Sister and I wanted to tell you about this, but we felt that you couldn’t take such a huge blow. Sister was afraid that you’d hurt your body if you were too angry and upset, so she told me to keep quiet for now.”
