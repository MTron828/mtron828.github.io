Chapter 429: Boycott the Black-Hearted Lily Qiao Anxin!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The live-stream was ongoing.

The emcee smilingly asked, “Anxin, all of us know that you’re a gentle and kind person in the eyes of all your fans and the public. But we’d still like to know if you’ve got a side that no one has actually seen before.

“Say, some parts about you that are very private to yourself.”

As this was a live-stream, Qiao Anxin was able to see the fans’ and users’ real-time reactions.

She held the microphone and smiled as she started her response. “Of course I do. I guess everyone has a side that nobody really knows about. Even celebrities have one too. They can’t show all about themselves. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Take me, for example. I usually appear bubbly and optimistic in front of everyone. But there are times when I experience negative feelings too. That’s another side of me.”

The emcee feigned surprise. “Oh? Anxin, you have negative feelings too?”

Qiao Anxin nodded. “Of course. Even the happiest person has their bad times too.”

The emcee asked, “During such moments, what methods do you use to regulate your emotions?”

Qiao Anxin smiled and was about to reply when she saw a comment appear on the screen: [So that’s the reason for you to be a third-party and steal your sister’s man?]

She was stunned, and her expression immediately changed.

The emcee saw that she looked a little odd and turned to look at the screen as well. She was equally shocked.

The very next moment.

A few other comments came rolling in: [Haha, so you were a third party. That was your “private life” that no one knew about, huh.]

[Qiao Anxin, are you shameless or what? It’s bad enough that you’re stealing someone else’s man, but your sister’s?! That’s so gross.]

[I’ve never seen a woman as disgusting as you. Not only did you steal your sister’s man, you even turned around and slandered her. This is so low and despicable, I can’t f**king stand it. An artiste as terrible as you ought to be taken out of the public sphere, lest you teach kids the wrong values.]

[Qiao Anxin, out of the entertainment industry!]

[We need to silence this black-hearted lily! Boycott the black-hearted lily Qiao Anxin!]

The comments rolled in too quickly.

Everyone present saw it.

The production crew was in utter shock as well, and at that moment, they couldn’t react.

The netizens weren’t stopping.

But, thankfully, the emcee made a move to stop it.

She quickly took the cell phone and turned off the comment section.

But everything that had been sent in was already seen.

Qiao Anxin’s expression was awful.

She wanted to get her manager here right away to ask what exactly happened.

But the live-stream was still on.

She couldn’t just walk out.

The emcee seemed to be caught in a spot. She’d conducted this interview so many times, but a situation like this was a first.

It was too awkward.

It would have been so much easier to handle if this wasn’t a live-stream. Editing could’ve been done to salvage it.

But this happened during a live-stream, and it was all so sudden. There was no way to have stopped it.

She wondered who else had seen the comments besides them.
