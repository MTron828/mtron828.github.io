Besides, Madam Mo was not the only one hurt in this relationship. Tang Ya’s mother was also considered a victim.

“So, Dad didn’t know that she was already pregnant at that time. Then, does Tang Ya think that Dad has let her mother down, so she’s targeting the Mo Family and standing up for her?”

“Perhaps. She and her mother always relied on each other, so they have a good relationship. It’s not impossible.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“What do you plan to do if Tang Ya is really your half-sister?” Qiao Mianmian asked.

Even if Mo Yesi had no feelings for his half-sister, she was still his blood-related sister.

It was impossible for him to deal with her like how he dealt with ordinary people.

However, Mo Yesi said coldly, “No matter who she is, I won’t be merciful if she attacks the Mo Family.

“The grudges of the previous generation have nothing to do with me. I only know that I will not forgive anyone who dares to hurt my family.”

So what if she was his biological sister?

“Should we let Dad know about this?” Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and expressed her opinion. “If Tang Ya is really his daughter, should we let him know about this? Besides, if Tang Ya is really targeting the Mo Family because of her mother, is there a misunderstanding? Only Dad knows clearly

what happened back then. Can we ask him?”

“Tm thinking about this, too.” Mo Yesi said after some thought, “Let me think about it.”

After recording “My Intern Parents”, Qiao Mianmian did not take on any other jobs for the time being and went on leave.

During this period, she would visit Jiang Luoli and her niece occasionally, go to Mo Yesi’s company to accompany him, or go back to the Bai residence to spend time with Mother Bai and Father Bai. Even though life seemed peaceful, time passed really quickly.

On this day, Qiao Mianmian made some pastries for Mo Yesi at home.

She had learned how to make pastries from Mother Bai, and she thought that they were pretty good after tasting them.

For the past few days, she sent Mo Yesi something every day.

Either she made the pastries, or she made the fruit juice herself. She didn’t know if Mo Yesi liked it or not, but he was very supportive every time. He ate everything she sent over.

His support made Qiao Mianmian’s afternoon tea even more enthusiastic.

She had been sending them for a week.

On the way to the Mo Corporation… Qiao Mianmian received a call.

It was a surprising call.

The person who called her was Madam Gong.

“Hello, Ms. Qiao. I’m Gong Zeli’s mother. Do you have time now? Is it convenient for you to meet me?”

“Madam Gong?” Qiao Mianmian was very surprised. “You want to see me? Is that something you can’t tell me over the phone?”

The other party was silent for a while before answering, “There are some things that I think we should talk about. Ms. Qiao, don’t worry. I’m trying to cause trouble for you. I just want to ask you for a favor.”

Qiao Mianmian agreed to see Madam Gong in the end.

Even though she didn’t know why Madam Gong was looking for her, she could guess that it had something to do with Gong Zeli.

Madam Gong arranged for them to meet at a high-end cafe, a good place for afternoon tea.

Half an hour later, Qiao Mianmian arrived at the agreed-upon location.

After she got off the car and walked into the cafe, a waiter came up to her. “Ms. Qiao, right? Madam Gong has booked a private room. Please follow me..”
