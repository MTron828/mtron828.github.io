Chapter 2043: About to Lose to the Childhood Sweetheart

They couldn’t wait to see what she would donate.

If it wasn’t as good as Shen Rou’s set of jewelry, she would just be embarrassing herself.

The set of jewelry Shen Rou donated was worth more than 50 million yuan.

If Qiao Mianmian wanted to save face, she would either donate something similar or something more expensive.

Without Mo Yesi’s support, she probably wouldn’t be able to fork out so much money.

It seemed like the real girlfriend was going to lose to the childhood sweetheart tonight.

The set of jewelry was quickly sold for 53 million yuan.

Duban’s set of jewelry was a global limited edition set. There was no need to worry about not being able to sell it.

“Thank you for your support, Miss Shen. Let us thank you again with applause.”

The emcee announced that the 53 million yuan from Shen Rou’s jewelry would be used for charity in the future.

“Thank you, everyone. And thank you for giving me the chance to help the poor children.” Shen Rou bowed humbly to the people below the stage and then walked down gracefully.

She returned to her seat.

She stopped when she passed by Qiao Mianmian and then sat down.

On stage, the emcee read out the next person’s name.

Celebrities also loved gossip.

Hence, many people knew about the triangle between Qiao Mianmian, Shen Rou, and Mo Yesi.

When Qiao Mianmian got up and walked towards the stage, everyone looked at her.

Like the netizens in the live stream, everyone couldn’t wait to see what she would donate.

With Shen Rou’s 50 million, if she donated something too ordinary, she definitely wouldn’t be able to save face.

It cost a lot of money to maintain her image.

She might not be able to.

On stage.

Qiao Mianmian looked at the pairs of eyes waiting to watch a show and felt amused.

She could guess what they were thinking.

Everyone was probably waiting to see what she would donate next.

Shen Rou was one of them.

Everyone probably thought that she would compete with Shen Rou to win.

If Qiao Mianmian could win if she really wanted to.

It wasn’t difficult for her to fork out 50 million yuan.

She could donate a sum of money directly, and even more than Shen Rou.

But Qiao Mianmian had no such intention.

She didn’t think that her face was important, nor did she think that if she donated less than Shen Rou, she would lose to her.

She wasn’t interested in competing with Shen Rou over this.

To her, winning or losing wasn’t important.

Hence, when the gossipy emcee asked her what she was going to donate to the auction, Qiao Mianmian smiled and took the bracelet off her wrist. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The bracelet was given to her by Mo Yesi.

Back then, Qiao Mianmian saw that this bracelet didn’t look very expensive and was low profile, so she kept it on.

She placed the bracelet on the display table. “This is a bracelet I like very much. It was given to me by a friend of mine. If you like it, you can bid for it.”
