Chapter 2394: Come and Sit Here

The thought of his goddess sitting beside him excited him.

Shen Xin had just walked to the seat when she heard the sound of fingers knocking on the table. She turned around and heard Qiao Chen say calmly, “There’s no one sitting beside me. Come and sit here.”

Everyone in the room was shocked.

Qiao Chen took the initiative to ask Shen Xin to sit beside him?

He used to avoid her!

Even Shen Xin was stunned.

Seeing that she was looking at him, Qiao Chen covered his mouth and said, “Fatty and Dong will be drinking later. You’ll affect their drinking by sitting between them.”

Fatty and Dong were speechless.

Who said they were going to drink?

Moreover, even if they wanted to drink, it wouldn’t matter if Shen Xin was between them, right?

Before Dong could react, a classmate tugged at his shirt and gave him a look.

How stupid.

Couldn’t he tell?

Qiao Chen was obviously trying to get Shen Xin to sit beside him, so he found an excuse.

It wasn’t about drinking, he just wanted Shen Xin to sit beside him.

Even the slow-witted boys could tell Qiao Chen’s true intention.

The girls could tell too.

They were wondering if Qiao Chen liked Shen Xin.

He used to avoid her.

But now, he actually took the initiative to ask Shen Xin to sit beside him.

He definitely wouldn’t do this if he hated her.

But they really couldn’t understand it.

Why did Qiao Chen suddenly start liking Shen Xin?

Was it really as he said, that he’d always liked Shen Xin and was unwilling to accept her in the past because he felt that he wasn’t worthy of her? Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The girls’ expressions darkened.

If Qiao Chen liked Shen Xin, they had no chance!

“Oh, right, right, right. We’re going to drink later.” A certain fatty finally understood what was going on and nodded profusely. “Student Shen Xin, I’m sorry. You can sit with Qiao Chen.”

Qiao Chen had already pulled out the chair beside him.

Shen Xin looked and he looked at each other for a while. She stood beside Fatty for a few seconds before walking towards Qiao Chen.

The girls looked at her with jealousy.

Shen Xin’s dressing style was still as extravagant as before.

She took off her coat after entering the private room, showing her good figure. She was a 17 or 18-year-old girl, just like a blooming flower.

She was wearing a tight black velvet dress. Although it was a dress, the style was the same as a mini dress.

The black velvet dress was made of shiny material. Under the light of the crystal, it looked like she was sparkling.

Her makeup was exquisite, and her hair was curled up. There was also a diamond-studded hair clip with two tassels hanging down.

Shen Xin was pretty usually.

She was even more stunning when she dressed up.

The few guys who had a crush on her were stunned.

Their goddess got prettier.
