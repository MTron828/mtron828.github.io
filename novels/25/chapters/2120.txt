Chapter 2121: Ha, Who Do You Think You Are?

“Qiao Chen, what are you doing here?” Qiao Anxin turned around and saw Qiao Chen standing outside the kitchen. She frowned and said in an unfriendly tone, “Were you eavesdropping on me?”

Qiao Chen couldn’t hide the disgust in his eyes. He resisted the urge to roll his eyes and said coldly, “Do you think everyone likes to do such things?”

Qiao Anxin’s expression darkened.

She turned green. “Qiao Chen, what do you mean? Who likes to eavesdrop? Don’t be sarcastic!”

Qiao Chen sneered. “Sarcastic? Isn’t what I said the truth? You’ve already done it yourself, why are you afraid of others saying it?”

“You!” Qiao Anxin pointed at him. “Qiao Chen, don’t go overboard.”

“No matter how much I go overboard, I won’t be as shameless as you. Are all the men in the world dead? Why do you have to stare at the men around my sister? Qiao Anxin, I’m warning you. If you continue to stare at my brother-in-law, don’t blame me for being nasty.

“This time, don’t even think about stealing my brother-in-law from my sister.”

Qiao Anxin was stunned.

She looked at Qiao Chen’s cold eyes and panicked, but then quickly calmed down.

“What are you talking about? Get out of my way, I’m not interested in listening to your nonsense.”

Qiao Anxin wanted to push him away, but Qiao Chen grabbed her wrist.

He looked at her coldly and warned her. “I don’t care if you really don’t understand or if you’re just pretending. If you dare to do anything to hurt my sister again, I won’t let you off.”

“Let go of me!” Qiao Anxin’s face was scrunched up in pain. Shaking off Qiao Chen’s hand and looking down, she saw that a red mark had appeared on her wrist.

She bit her lip and glared at Qiao Chen.

She didn’t expect this sickly person to be so strong.

Her hand almost broke.

Qiao Anxin had designs on Mo Yesi, but she definitely wouldn’t admit it.

Qiao Chen was just guessing. As long as she didn’t admit it, what could he do to her?

She didn’t take Qiao Chen’s warning to heart.

He was just a sickly child adopted from an orphanage, she didn’t care about him.

She looked at Qiao Chen’s angry expression and couldn’t help but smile. “Qiao Chen, I think you should take care of yourself first. You won’t let me off? Ha, who do you think you are? Even if I really did something, what can you do to me?

“Do you think you can be like Qiao Mianmian and suddenly become a rich young master? Wake up. You’re an orphan that nobody wants. If your parents were rich and powerful, would they send you to the orphanage?

“You’re destined to be a pauper for the rest of your life. Your biological parents are just paupers of the lower class. Ah, I seem to have accidentally revealed something.” She covered her mouth as if she had accidentally said something she shouldn’t have, and a hint of panic appeared on her face.

Then, she looked at Qiao Chen apologetically. “Ah, Chen Chen, you won’t be sad, right? Actually, being an orphan isn’t a big deal. Don’t feel inferior. After all, this isn’t something you can decide, right?”
