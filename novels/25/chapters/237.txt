Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“In any case, Mianmian and I are over, we can never get back together. Anxin did a lot for me and made sacrifices too. I’ll be responsible for her and marry her.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“What are you saying?!” Mother Su looked at him in disbelief.

Su Ze took a deep breath. “I said, I’ll be responsible for Anxin.”

“You jerk, how did I give birth to this jerk of a son!”

Mother Su went forward and gave him a tight slap to the face. “Mianmian is such a nice girl, but you didn’t cherish her. You actually did such a terrible thing to hurt her. I really have to teach you a lesson today, so you’d know what’s right and what’s wrong!”

With that, she raised her arm again.

“Aunt, don’t hit Brother Ah Ze!”

Qiao Anxin grabbed Mother Su’s hand and stepped between the mother and son. She cried, “Brother Ah Ze isn’t in the wrong, it was me who deliberately seduced him. I’m shameless and despicable. I wasn’t able to control my feelings and ended up falling for him.

“He’s a normal man, he just wasn’t able to resist the temptations.

“It was also I who forced them to break up. I was behind all of it alone. Hit me if you must, don’t hit Brother Ah Ze.”

Mother Su was infuriated.

Her hand was shaking from all that she’d heard.

“Very well, you vixen!”

She grabbed Qiao Anxin’s wrist and used her hand to slap her. “You shameless woman, return my daughter-in-law. You seduced your sister’s man and caused me to lose a great daughter-in-law like Mianmian. Return her to me!”

“Mom, you can’t hit Anxin.”

Su Ze quickly came forward to stop her the moment Mother Su hit her.

“Stand aside, let me teach this vixen a lesson!”

The more he wanted to stop her, the angrier she got.

Su Ze stepped between Mother Su and Qiao Anxin.

“Mom.”

He pursed his lips for a moment and said to his agitated mother, “Anxin is pregnant. She’s carrying the Su family’s grandchild, you can’t hit her.”

“What? What did you say?!” Mother Su was completely stunned.

Su Ze closed his eyes and took another deep breath. He repeated, “Anxin is pregnant, she’s carrying your grandchild.”

“She’s carrying my grandchild?”

This statement was like a bomb that went off in Mother Su’s heart.

“Aunt, the baby is about two months old. I went for a check-up the other day, it’s a healthy baby.” Qiao Anxin slowly emerged from behind Su Ze.

A hint of smugness flashed past her eyes, but she maintained her sensible persona. “Brother Ah Ze and I decided to get married earlier because of this child. Aunt, you wouldn’t want this child to be born into an incomplete family, right?

“Aunt, I truly love Brother Ah Ze. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be carrying his baby while my career is taking off. Being pregnant has a huge impact on my work too. So, I hope you can give us your blessings.”

Su Ze put his arm around Qiao Anxin. He couldn’t help but feel touched by how Qiao Anxin had taken the blame and tried to protect and defend him with all she could.
