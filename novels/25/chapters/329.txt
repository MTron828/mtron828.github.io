Chapter 330: Women should Have Some Flesh

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Before she’d broken up with Su Ze, it was also Su Ze who had brought up the topic of marriage. But she hadn’t agreed.

If she and he were still together, she likely wouldn’t have been married by now either. At least, she’d only think about it after her graduation and when she’d found a job.

But things turned out so differently...

Even she hadn’t expected to get married so young.

She hesitated for a while before replying: [I have my reasons. I’ll explain it all to you later, alright?

Jiang Luoli: [Alright, then. But what about Chen Chen? He seems to have suffered a blow or something, look how distracted he is now. Could he have fallen for that girl?]

Qiao Mianmian turned around to look at Qiao Chen when she read the message. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Qiao Chen wasn’t emotionally present ever since Shen Xin left.

He usually wasn’t this quiet.

In front of his close friends and family, he often had much to talk about.

But today, he was oddly silent, and his appetite seemed affected.

He didn’t look like somebody who’d just rejected a girl. Rather, it seemed like a girl had rejected him.

He was obviously in heartbreak mode.

Qiao Mianmian had a lot of questions, but it wasn’t convenient to ask them in front of everyone.

She had to find time to chat with him alone.

It was obvious to her that there was something more between Qiao Chen and Shen Xin.

Qiao Chen couldn’t possibly detest her for real.

If he really detested her so much, he wouldn’t have allowed her to pursue him for three years.

The siblings were rather similar in terms of their views towards people and relationships.

If they truly detested someone, they’d show their unhappiness and reject them once and for all. They wouldn’t possibly give them any hopes.

“What are you thinking?” A low voice sounded by her ear as a piece of meat was dropped into her bowl.

The man looked at her tenderly. “Why are you eating so little today? Are the dishes not to your palate?”

Qiao Mianmian looked up and saw Mo Yesi’s look of concern. She tried to shelve her thoughts about Qiao Chen for now and smiled at him. “Nope, the food is good.”

“Eat more, then.” Mo Yesi scooped some more food into her bowl. “You’re already so slim, you should eat more. You have the appetite of a kitten, it’s hard to get you to gain weight.”

Qiao Mianmian mumbled, “I’m an actress now. I’ve got to watch my image and figure.”

Compared to other female celebrities who only ate vegetables and steamed foods, her consumption was already considered rather big.

She wasn’t a picky eater, unlike the other female celebrities who strictly stayed away from high-calorie foods.

There weren’t many celebrities in the industry who dared to eat like her.

She’d thought that her mumbling was soft, that only she could hear herself.

But the moment she said it, the man beside her chuckled lightly. “You’re already as skinny as a bamboo, how much further do you want to go? Even if you want to maintain a nice figure, women should have some flesh. So you won’t look sickly.”

He just meant for her to eat more.

But to Qiao Mianmian, it sounded as if he despised her figure.

She pouted and said, “I’m not like a bamboo. I just seem skinny, but I have flesh too! I’m 1.68m tall, and I weigh 55kg. That’s a suitable weight for my height! I’m not too skinny!”
