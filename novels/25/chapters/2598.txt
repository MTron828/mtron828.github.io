Qiao Mianmian looked at the dress and the pair of blue high heels in the box and turned to ask the butler, “This dress and this pair of shoes were chosen by Mo Yesi?”

“I’m not sure if the Young Master picked it himself. But from what Assistant Wei said, it should be so. Does Young Madam like it?” The butler felt that he was asking nonsense.

How could Qiao Mianmian not like it?

A few housemaids were also standing by the side. Their eyes lit up when they saw the dress.

Hence, girls should like it.

“Mm, I do.” Qiao Mianmian nodded. “The dress and shoes are very beautiful, I like them very much.”

“That’s good. If the Young Master knows that Young Madam likes the gift he picked for you so much, he’ll be very happy.”

…

Qiao Mianmian went upstairs to try on the dress.

Mo Yesi had good taste.

His taste was different from other straight men.

His taste was pretty good. Whether it was for himself or for her, he had high standards.

Moreover, the measurements were suitable.

It was as if it was custom-made for her.

When Linda informed Qiao Mianmian that she was shortlisted for the Golden Globe Awards, it was only a week away.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t have time to customize a dress for the awards ceremony.

A high-end dress had to be custom-made a month in advance.

Especially handmade ones.

And it would take a long time. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

But Qiao Mianmian didn’t expect Mo Yesi to find such a suitable dress for her in just a week.

The dress fit her perfectly.

“Wow, Young Madam is so beautiful.”

“Yes, yes. Young Madam looks like a goddess in this dress. She’s so beautiful.”

“Young Master has such good taste. This dress seems to be tailored for Young Madam. If Young Madam wears this dress to attend tonight’s party, she’ll definitely be the most stunning one.”

The two housemaids who helped Qiao Mianmian try on the dress were stunned.

Qiao Mianmian’s skin was fair.

The blue dress made her skin look even fairer.

The dress was off-the-shoulder, and the waist was well-tied. The long skirt made her legs look even longer.

Qiao Mianmian looked like a fairy from the heavens.

“There’s no lack of beauties in the entertainment industry. Everyone will be dressed up tonight, there must be people more beautiful than me.” Qiao Mianmian wasn’t a narcissist, so she didn’t feel much about the housemaids’ flattery. She even corrected them.

It was fine if no one else heard it.

If she told others about it, she would probably be used as an article again.

“Yes, Young Madam is right.” The housemaid quickly corrected herself. “But in my eyes, Young Madam is the most beautiful.”

After trying the dress, Qiao Mianmian tried the shoes.

They were all very suitable.

After the fitting, the butler brought a few more people upstairs and explained to Qiao Mianmian, “Young Madam, these are the people Young Master arranged to do your makeup.. They will be in charge of Young Madam’s styling and makeup for the awards ceremony.”
