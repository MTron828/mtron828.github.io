Chapter 2244: She Knew How Picky Mo Yesi Was

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian looked at the comments praising her and smiled.

Mo Yesi leaned over. “What are you looking at so happily?”

“Look!” Qiao Mianmian handed the cell phone over proudly. “I was reading the comments online.”

Mo Yesi took the cell phone and looked at it for a while before returning it to her.

“Mm, I saw it. They’re all praising your acting.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Then, what do you think of my acting?” Qiao Mianmian leaned on his shoulder and looked up at him. “You’re not allowed to lie to me. You have to tell me the truth. Good is good, bad is bad. No matter what you say, I can accept it.”

“Alright.” Mo Yesi smiled. “I’ll be honest, then.”

“Alright, go ahead.” Qiao Mianmian pursed her lips and looked at him nervously.

Although she was praised on Weibo, Qiao Mianmian still valued Mo Yesi’s comments.

She felt that he was a very picky person.

Mo Yesi lowered his head and thought for a while before saying, “I don’t usually watch television dramas, because there aren’t many shows that I think are of good quality. Moreover, the entertainment industry is in the so-called era of popularity. Most of it depends on looks, and there aren’t many actors with good acting skills.

“But after watching the first episode, I think it’s not bad. At least, I can continue watching it.”

Qiao Mianmian smiled. “You really think it’s good?”

“Mm, at least for me. It’s a passable work.”

Mo Yesi didn’t praise her too much.

But his words made Qiao Mianmian especially happy.

She knew how picky he was.

His “not bad” was good enough for others.

This was a good comment.

“Alright, then I’m relieved.” Qiao Mianmian patted her chest. “I’m just afraid that if I don’t perform well, the audience will despise me.”

“How could that be?”

Mo Yesi pinched her cheek. “Don’t worry. Your performance is already very good. Didn’t you see the comments just now? Everyone is praising you, so everyone thinks you acted very well.”

Mo Yesi now knew that Qiao Mianmian was really suitable to be an actress.

She was really good at it.

Although they weren’t in the same industry, he could tell if an actress performed well.

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian nodded. “I’m relieved now. But I don’t know how high the viewership ratings will be. I hope it’ll be good.”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t have high expectations for the ratings.

She had never thought of making it big.

This was her first television drama, and Qiao Mianmian didn’t dare to think too highly of it. In her opinion, it was fine as long as she got good results.

Although she had filmed some other television dramas in the past, she was just an extra back then and didn’t even have a proper face.

They couldn’t possibly give her the chance to perform.

“It’ll definitely be good..” Mo Yesi hugged her and smiled.
