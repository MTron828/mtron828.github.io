Chapter 90: Remember to Miss Me

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“No...” Qiao Mianmian was a little stunned and immediately denied it.

Why would he be an embarrassment?

He was such an outstanding man.

But it was precisely because he was too outstanding that she didn’t want him around.

His appearance these two days already made her more hated in school than before.

Mo Yesi opened the door and said, without room for discussion, “Then let me walk you there. Let’s go.”

When they got off, Mo Yesi held her hand.

His palm was so big and warm. She felt secure with her hand in his.

It was as if they were going to hold their hands this way for life.

They strolled into the campus.

Mo Yesi was in a suit and dressed like a professional elite. His handsome face and unmistakable charm were eye-catching.

Not to mention those long legs and perfect figure.

He was almost 1.90m in height and would stand out in every setting.

A good number of girls squealed and stole glances at him along the way.

“Do you know who this guy is? He’s so handsome.”

“Is the girl beside him Qiao Mianmian? Didn’t she just break up with Su Ze, why is she with another man already?”

“I heard Qiao Mianmian cheated on Su Ze and that’s why they broke up. Could this be the man?”

“Su Ze is so handsome, and he comes from a rich family. He’s always been nice to her, how could she cheat on him? I think this man is just handsome but has no other strengths. Is he even as rich as Su Ze?”

“Yeah, I even heard that Su Ze gave Qiao Mianmian a huge sum of money when they broke up. Could this man be a pretty boy?”

A lot of people actually mocked her after her break-up with Su Ze.

They had thought she would be pathetic and pitiful.

But who would have expected that she would find a hunk so soon after?

His wealth and status aside, just his looks alone had a lot of people jealous of him.

How was Qiao Mianmian deserving of finding an even better boyfriend?!

In any case, Qiao Mianmian did not hear any of these discussions. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Mo Yesi walked Qiao Mianmian all the way to the dormitory.

“Go on up.” He released her hand and looked at her. “I’ll watch you go up first.”

“Oh, then... then I’ll go ahead. You should head back to the office too.”

The moment he released her hand, Qiao Mianmian felt oddly empty, as if something was missing.

It was slightly over 10 minutes of holding his hand.

Why did she feel like it was a familiar norm?

She waved at him. “Bye.”

With that, she turned away and was ready to go up.

“Mianmian.”

Qiao Mianmian had only taken two steps when she heard him.

He sounded so gentle.

Qiao Mianmian’s heart fluttered and she stopped in her tracks.

She turned around slowly. “Is there anything else?”

Mo Yesi took a huge step forward and looked down at her with a smile. “Mm, I forgot something.”

“What is it?”

He wrapped her in an embrace.

He then kissed her—purely and without any other desire. “Eat well, study well, sleep well. And don’t forget to miss me.”
