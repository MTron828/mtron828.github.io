Chapter 818: What Are You Doing, Don’t Kiss Me Outside From Now On

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

But as long as they weren’t married, they still had a chance.

Moreover, Chairman Mo never liked women. Now that he was willing to have a girlfriend, did it mean that he had changed?

Was he interested in the opposite sex?

Hence, they actually had a chance.

What if...

If a man like Chairman Mo took a liking to one of them, even if she couldn’t marry into the Mo family, being able to date such a man would be a wonderful memory.

And Chairman Mo was so rich.

Even if they broke up, he would definitely compensate them.

Anyway, they wouldn’t lose anything.

With that thought in mind, the female employees smiled even wider when Mo Yesi walked past them. “Good afternoon, Chairman Mo.”

Mo Yesi walked straight towards Qiao Mianmian.

The female employees followed his gaze and saw a woman in a white dress. He reached out and touched her head.

His actions were gentle and loving.

They’d never seen such gentleness and affection before.

The group of people were a little stunned and couldn’t help but start discussing among themselves.

“Who’s that woman? I noticed her just now. She’s rather good-looking. She looks a little young, but Chairman Mo seems to treat her differently. Is she Chairman Mo’s sister?”

“No way, I’ve never heard that Chairman Mo has a sister.”

“Is that Chairman Mo’s girlfriend? Didn’t you say that Chairman Mo had a girlfriend and brought her to the office before?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Mm, that’s Chairman Mo’s girlfriend. She came to the office twice before. Chairman Mo really dotes on her. I heard that before his girlfriend came, he even got his secretary to prepare a lot of snacks in the office.”

“Wow, I really didn’t expect Chairman Mo to know how to pamper a woman.”

“How could that be? No matter how cold a man is, he’ll still be different when he meets the woman he likes. How could a man not know how to pamper a woman? It’s just that he hadn’t met the person he wanted to pamper before.”

The female employees were discussing enthusiastically.

On the other side.

“How long have you been waiting downstairs?” Mo Yesi held Qiao Mianmian’s hand and led her out of the rest area.

The man interlocked his fingers with hers.

His gaze never left her, as if she was the only person in his eyes.

“I just arrived.”

Qiao Mianmian felt the employees around her looking at her and felt a little embarrassed. She pursed her lips and asked softly, “Aren’t you busy now?”

“I’m busy.”

Mo Yesi smiled. “But no matter how busy I am, I have to pick you up.”

Qiao Mianmian smiled sweetly. “Then, am I delaying your work? Actually, I can go up by myself.”

“Work isn’t as important as my wife.” Mo Yesi held her hand and led her into the elevator. After pressing the button for the top floor, he lifted her chin and kissed her lightly on the lips. “My wife is first, the rest are behind.”

The elevator doors hadn’t closed.

Qiao Mianmian turned around and saw the employees looking at them.

She blushed and patted his chest. “What are you doing, don’t kiss me outside again.”

“Baby, this is the elevator.”
