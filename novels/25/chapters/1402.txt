Chapter 1405: It’s a Mistake to Make You Angry

“I’m sorry, I might not be able to be by your side like other boyfriends. I know I’m not good enough, and I’ve been thinking about how to balance my work and feelings...”

“Wait.”

Jiang Luoli felt that Mo Shixiu had misunderstood something. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Did he think that she was angry because he didn’t accompany her often?

“Mo Shixiu, why are you apologizing to me?”

Mo Shixiu was silent for a while before saying, “I was wrong.”

Jiang Luoli asked, “...What do you think you did wrong?”

“It’s wrong to make you angry.”

“...”

“You have to apologize for your mistake.”

“...”

“In the future, besides my work, I’ll give you my private time.” This was the best he could do.

“Mo Shixiu, I think you’ve misunderstood me.”

Jiang Luoli sighed. “I’m not blaming you for not having time to accompany me.”

He had misunderstood her.

“Not because of this?” Mo Shixiu frowned. “Then, why?”

Jiang Luoli was speechless.

It seemed like he really didn’t think there was anything wrong with their interaction.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t have asked.

“Mo Shixiu, don’t you think there’s something wrong with our relationship?” They were technically a couple, but they were just friends.

Mo Shixiu’s expression changed slightly. “What’s wrong?”

Jiang Luoli said, “...Don’t you think we’re different from other couples? We’re a couple, but I don’t think we’re in a relationship at all. If you’re only with me because of responsibility, there’s no need to.”

Mo Shixiu frowned at her for a while. “No.”

Jiang Luoli was stunned. “What?”

“Not entirely because of responsibility.”

Jiang Luoli’s heart started racing.

“Then, why?”

“I don’t know.” Mo Shixiu looked a little lost. He paused for a while before looking at her and saying, “But I don’t want you to be with another man.”

Jiang Luoli was speechless.

Did he understand what he meant?

“Jiang Luoli.” Mo Shixiu suddenly called her name.

Jiang Luoli looked at him.

The man was extremely handsome. Every part of his face seemed to have been meticulously carved by God. His eyebrows, eyes, nose, and lips were all good-looking.

He had a noble temperament and was born with elegance. Wearing a white shirt, he looked like a rich young master from ancient times.

Strangers were like jade, and the young master was unparalleled.

Jiang Luoli felt that these two sentences were perfect for Mo Shixiu.

This man was good-looking, had a good family background, was capable, and had a good character.

He was almost perfect.

Every time Jiang Luoli saw him, she would doubt her charm.

She couldn’t help but wonder if Mo Shixiu really liked her.

What did he like about her?

There were so many women in his circle who were more outstanding than her, but none of them could move him. Would he really fall for her?

How could she attract him?

In terms of looks, men of his status had seen all sorts of beauties.

“I might not understand my feelings for you yet, but I know that I chose to be with you not just because of responsibility. I’ve never thought of breaking up with you, and you can stop thinking about breaking up. I can’t give you to another man.”
