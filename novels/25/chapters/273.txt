“The Shen family has two daughters, and among our circle of friends, only Yu Sheng and I are older than her. She used to love sticking to us and addressed us as her older brothers.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She felt that there really was no perfect person in this world.

Take Mo Yesi for example. He had an exceptional brain and was able to manage a company with tens of thousands of employees. But when it came to matters of the heart, he was evidently rather inept.

He actually couldn’t tell that Shen Rou liked him.

Meanwhile, she’d only met Shen Rou once and realized it right away.

They’d known each other for over 20 years, and he actually believed that Shen Rou saw him as an older brother and nothing more?

How naive.

“Is something wrong?” Mo Yesi asked when he saw her look of disbelief.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but sigh again when she saw his confusion. “Have you never thought that Shen Rou might like you that way?”

Mo Yesi was stunned. Shock was evident in his eyes at first, then his brows furrowed. “She likes me?”

Seeing his reaction, Qiao Mianmian suddenly felt pity for Shen Rou.

She’d liked him for so many years and made it so obvious, and he couldn’t even tell.

This really was a sad reality.

For a man like Mo Yesi, if his admirer had a secret liking for him without verbalizing it to him directly, he might never find out even until they died.

“Yup.” Qiao Mianmian said, “You didn’t sense it at all?”

Mo Yesi’s brows were knitted even tighter now. “Who told you that? She said it?”

“She didn’t tell me.” Qiao Mianmian shook her head. “I could tell for myself. Shen Rou is probably a rather prideful girl. She wouldn’t directly tell the person she likes about her feelings.”

She felt that Shen Rou might be waiting for Mo Yesi to make the first move.

But who would’ve expected that after so many years, she realized that Mo Yesi had no interest in her, and in fact, had an allergic reaction towards women?

And then, he actually married another woman.

Shen Rou liked him for so many years but never confessed it to him. Besides the part about her pride, it was likely also because she didn’t feel threatened at all.

After all, Mo Yesi was simply not interested in women.

She never thought that he would suddenly get married someday.

Her sudden burst of anger and bitterness must have stemmed from the sense of threat and crisis she was feeling now.

Back then, Mo Yesi didn’t belong to her, but at least he didn’t belong to anyone else.

But now, he was a man with a wife.

Mo Yesi looked astonished.

It was as if he’d never seen it this way.

He suddenly looked at Qiao Mianmian deeply. “You’re jealous?”

Qiao Mianmian was slightly confused.

How did he tell that she was jealous?

“Don’t worry.” Mo Yesi went silent for a while before saying seriously, “Be it in the past or the present, I’ve only seen her as a sister. I can’t control what she thinks, but I’m very sure about what I think.

“Shen Rou will never be a threat to you.”

He seemed to be making a promise of sorts.

Qiao Mianmian’s facial muscles twitched. “Well... I’m not jealous. Actually, although we’re married, I know that it’s only because of certain reasons. So, whether it’s another woman liking you or you liking another woman, I... don’t mind it.

“I just hope that the girls you get involved with won’t find their way to me. I... am not too good at dealing with this. Since you and Miss Shen have known each other for so many years, I hope that you won’t mismanage the situation because of me and end up affecting your relationship with her.”
