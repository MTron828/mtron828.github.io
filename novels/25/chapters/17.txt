Qiao Mianmian went quiet.

She couldn’t even begin to imagine how Qiao Chen would react.

“W-What?” Qiao Chen was shocked once again. “You’re my brother-in-law?”

He looked toward Qiao Mianmian like a lost child at a junction. “Sister, what’s going on? Isn’t my brother-in-law Brother Ze? What happened?”

Mo Yesi’s expression darkened a little as he heard him mention Su Ze.

His solemn look was intimidating.

Qiao Chen immediately shrank back.

Qiao Mianmian doted on him the most and instantly turned to glare at Mo Yesi when she saw how afraid he was. “Why are you scaring Chen Chen, he’s still a patient.”

At this point, however, he was less afraid of Mo Yesi.

Seeing how protective she was, Mo Yesi said, “He’s so timid for a boy, is this your doing?”

“It’s you who’s too terrifying.” As someone of a “protective nature”, Qiao Mianmian had become a lot gutsier than before. She talked back at him, “Chen Chen isn’t this timid usually.”

On the hospital bed.

Qiao Chen had just snapped out of his shock.

He looked at Qiao Mianmian, then turned his gaze towards Mo Yesi beside her. He still found it hard to accept this fact. “Sister, is he really my brother-in-law?”

Qiao Mianmian felt an intense glare directed at her the moment Qiao Chen asked the question.

She paused for a moment before nodding. “Yup.”

Qiao Chen was stunned.

“Then, you and Brother Ze...”

That terrifying brother-in-law glared at him again.

Qiao Chen stopped mid-sentence and dared not go on.

Qiao Mianmian looked at him calmly and explained, “He and I have broken up.”

Qiao Chen was taken aback. “Why?”

He stole a glance at Mo Yesi and suddenly thought of a possibility. He felt uncomfortable about it.

This supposed brother-in-law was evidently of a different league from Su Ze.

He was way more handsome than Su Ze and gave off a more respectable aura—one that Su Ze never did.

To be fair, Su Ze was a decent candidate.

But if one had to compare him to this man over here, the contrast was stark.

One was a Young Master of an ordinarily rich family, while the other was a powerful man with a background akin to that of a royal family. There was no room for discussion.

Qiao Chen wondered if his sister had cheated!

He despised such acts of unfaithfulness.

But Qiao Mianmian was his biological sister.

If she really did it, what was he to do?

Just as Qiao Chen was running through these thoughts and wondering whether to forgive his sister for her wrongdoing, Qiao Mianmian coldly said, “He got together with Qiao Anxin.”

Qiao Chen kept quiet for a few seconds before widening his eyes in a mix of shock and fury. “He cheated?! He’s with Qiao Anxin now? How could they do this to you...”

Qiao Mianmian was expressionless. “In any case, he and I are over.”

“Yup, your sister and he are over. The man who has anything to do with her now is me.” Mo Yesi took a few steps forward and placed his hand on Qiao Mianmian’s shoulder gently.

Qiao Mianmian went quiet.

And so did Qiao Chen.
