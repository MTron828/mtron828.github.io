Chapter 2112: That Slut Can’t Compare to Me

Her eyes were red with jealousy, and they looked scary.

“20 million!?” Lin Huizhen was shocked. She looked at the watch carefully and then clenched it tightly. “This watch is actually so expensive? No wonder your dad said it’s too expensive. What limited edition did you say it was? It can’t be bought with money?”

“Mm, global limited edition. The people who can buy it are all extraordinary.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“In that case, if we sell this watch, we can get a pretty sum?” Lin Huizhen’s eyes lit up.

Qiao Anxin sensed that something was amiss and looked up. “Mom, why are you asking this?”

“It’s nothing.” Lin Huizhen snapped out of her daze and said casually, “I was just asking. Since this watch is so valuable, I thought I’d keep it in the safe.

“I’ll put this watch away now, you can go downstairs.” As Lin Huizhen spoke, she sized Qiao Anxin up and down. “The dress you’re wearing today is very nice.”

“Really?” Qiao Anxin was happy to hear that. “Mom, do you really think I look good in this dress?”

“Mm, not bad.” Lin Huizhen nodded. “Your makeup looks pretty good today. Anxin, are you going out?” she couldn’t help but ask.

Qiao Anxin glanced downstairs and touched her face. “It’s Dad’s birthday today, why would I go out? Mom, who do you think looks prettier today, me or Qiao Mianmian?

“I look prettier than her, right?”

This was Qiao Anxin’s most expensive dress.

She usually couldn’t bear to wear it.

But she took it out when she found out that Mo Yesi was coming to their house today.

Lin Huizhen was stunned.

After a while, she looked up at Qiao Anxin. “Anxin, you’re not going out today, why are you dressed so formally? What’s there to compare between you and Qiao Mianmian? In Mom’s eyes, you’re definitely the prettiest.”

Qiao Anxin was obviously dissatisfied with this answer.

She said impatiently, “Mom, why do you care so much? Who said I can’t dress up at home? That slut Qiao Mianmian is back today, I definitely can’t lose to her.

“Just say that I’m prettier than her.”

“Of course you’re prettier. My daughter is so beautiful today, how can that slut compare?”

Qiao Anxin was elated.

She twirled her skirt around and looked smug. “That slut can’t compare to me. I’ll go downstairs now.”

With that, she turned around and went down the stairs.

Lin Huizhen stood there and watched her leave.

She knew her daughter well.

Hence, Lin Huizhen could tell what Qiao Anxin wanted to do.

In terms of looks, even if Lin Huizhen felt that her daughter was the best, she had to admit that Qiao Anxin couldn’t compare to Qiao Mianmian.

That slut Qiao Mianmian’s face was beautiful.

She was a vixen.
