Chapter 511: Is She Chairman Mo’s Girlfriend?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

This time, Mo Yesi was satisfied with his changes.

Once this was done, he deleted his conversation with Jiang Luoli and placed the cell phone back where it was.

Just before he left, he bowed down and kissed Qiao Mianmian on the forehead lightly, whispering, “Sweet dreams, Baby.”

...

Wei Zheng was extremely efficient. He got the outfits in under 30 minutes.

He carried the bags holding a full set of male and female outfits and headed to the Chairman’s office.

As he walked past the female secretaries’ desks, he got strange glances that were thirsty for gossip.

He suddenly stopped in his tracks, furrowed his brows, and said seriously, “What are all of you looking at? Get on with your work and stop gossiping about things you shouldn’t be.”

One of the secretaries was a little more daring. She spoke up and asked, “Personal Assistant Wei, are the clothes for Chairman Mo and the lady he brought here?”

The secretary seemed excited.

Wei Zheng knew what she was thinking. He glared at her and said, “Don’t let your mind run wild.”

She pouted innocently. “Personal Assistant Wei, are you misunderstanding something? I’m not thinking about anything of that sort.”

Wei Zheng took a deep breath and said, “Do you people think I have no idea what you guys are speculating? Just a word of advice, you’d better be less curious about anything that has got to do with Chairman Mo. That’s how you keep your job around here.

“You know what Chairman Mo’s temper is like.”

The secretary got a little serious but still couldn’t help but ask, “Can you at least tell us what that lady’s relationship is with Chairman Mo?

“Is she Chairman Mo’s girlfriend?” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Wei Zheng felt like this information should be alright to share with them.

He thought for a while and then nodded. “Mm, you could say so. You’d better be polite when you see her around.”

Wei Zheng said that Qiao Mianmian was Mo Yesi’s girlfriend because Mo Yesi didn’t think of going public about their actual relationship.

In that case, he had to keep the marriage a secret for now.

Being his girlfriend was enough to get their respect around here.

After all, everyone in the Mo Corporation knew that Chairman Mo never had a woman around him.

Hence, even if Young Madam was a mistress that Chairman Mo paid to keep him company, they had to show her respect.

“She really is Chairman Mo’s girlfriend?!” A few of them were utterly shocked.

It was as if this was impossible.

Then again, it was impossible for them.

They always saw Mo Yesi as a workaholic who spent every waking hour on his job, besides having to eat.

Where would he find the time to be in a relationship?

Moreover, he was such a solitary man. He didn’t even care to give a woman a second look no matter how beautiful she was.

He was almost like a monk, free of all mortal desires.

Based on what they knew, Chairman Mo had never dated anyone at all in all the 25 years of his life.
