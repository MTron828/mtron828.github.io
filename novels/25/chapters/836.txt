Chapter 838: I Like It When You’re Willful With Me

Qiao Mianmian looked at him, touched.

What kind of man was Mo Yesi?

He was too nice.

She actually met such an understanding husband.

Everyone said that she saved the galaxy in her previous life, and she felt the same way now.

She must have done a lot of good things in her previous life.

That was why God arranged such a perfect man for her.

It was a reward for her.

“Mo Yesi, you’re too good to me.” Qiao Mianmian was so touched that her eyes were brimming with tears. She threw herself into his arms and said coquettishly, “Why are you so good to me? I might become arrogant in the future.

“I might become more wilful and become someone you don’t like. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Mm, then be arrogant.” Mo Yesi enjoyed his wife throwing herself into his arms. He reached out and hugged her slender waist, then lowered his head to smell her hair. “You can be willful if you want. You can do whatever you want in front of me.

“I like it when you’re willful with me.”

If she was always so nice and obedient in front of him, he didn’t think it was a good thing.

He didn’t need her to be like this.

What he wanted was the real her.

She was someone who could do whatever she wanted in front of him.

“But all men are like this.” Qiao Mianmian lay in his arms and reached out to play with the buttons on his shirt. “It’s alright to say it now, but when women really become willful and insensible in the future, you men will feel that it’s pretentious and dislike it.”

Mo Yesi frowned slightly and looked down at her unhappily. “Who told you that? You men? Do you know men very well?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Was his focus on something else?

From his tone, she knew that he was probably jealous again and was imagining things that didn’t exist.

Then, he got jealous of his own imagination.

She looked up at him helplessly and amusedly. “I saw it in the books. And some examples of life are like this too. Although I don’t know men very well, I think this is the truth.”

In the honeymoon period of their relationship, they were all the best. They could do anything they wanted without fear of being despised.

But after this deadline...

Although she felt that Mo Yesi was different from other men, she used to think that Su Ze was different from other men too.

No one could predict what would happen in the future.

But she could feel that at this moment, he really did love her.

“This is only a part of the truth about men.” Mo Yesi furrowed his brows again as if he was dissatisfied with what she said. He reached out to hold her chin, looked into her eyes, and said, “It’s not mine.

“I don’t know what other men are like, but I know what I’m like. What you said will never happen to me. I know it doesn’t mean anything now, but I’ll prove it to you.

“Baby, have more confidence in me and us, alright?”

Qiao Mianmian nodded under his gentle and affectionate gaze.

She was willing to trust Mo Yesi more.
