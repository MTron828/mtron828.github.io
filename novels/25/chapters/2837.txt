Chapter 2840: Did You Say Something to Him?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Linda: [I’ll arrange another show for you. But what are your plans now that you know that Jiang Xinyue is Qiao Anxin? You can’t just sit back and do nothing. If she really came back to take revenge on you, even if you avoid her this time, she’ll definitely find a way to get close to you.]

Qiao Mianmian: [Mm, I’ve thought about this too. But if she doesn’t do anything now, I can’t do anything to her. I’d better observe her. If she just wants to return to the entertainment industry and doesn’t have any other thoughts, then I don’t have to do anything.]

Linda: [Anyway, be careful. I think her return this time is definitely not simple.]

Qiao Mianmian: [Mm, I’ll be careful.]

Linda: [It’s getting late, you should rest early. Goodnight.]

Qiao Mianmian: [Goodnight.]

After Qiao Mianmian ended her conversation with Linda, she got ready to sleep.

At this moment, someone knocked on the door.

Looking at the time, she looked at the door in confusion. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Who would be looking for her at this time?

Zhan Bo? Qin Han?

She quickly put on a coat and tidied her hair before walking to the door and opening it.

Qiao Mianmian was shocked to see the person standing outside.

She subconsciously took a step back.

At the door.

Qiao Anxin’s face was red from the alcohol, and her eyes were a little dazed. She held the door frame with one hand and sneered when she saw her. “Qiao Mianmian, why are you backing off? Do you think I’ll eat you up?”

“Jiang Xinyue, why are you looking for me?” Qiao Mianmian ignored her question and kept a distance from her.

It wasn’t Qin Han or Zhan Bo who knocked on her door. It was Jiang Xinyue.

No, it should be Qiao Anxin.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t know that she was Qiao Anxin before. Although she felt her hostility, she wasn’t too guarded against her.

Now that she knew that the person in front of her was Qiao Anxin, she had to be careful.

Qiao Anxin knocking on her door at this time wasn’t a good thing for Qiao Mianmian.

“Why? Can’t I look for you for no reason?” Seeing that Qiao Mianmian had no intention of inviting her in, Qiao Anxin sneered. “Senior Qiao, aren’t you going to invite me in?”

Qiao Mianmian looked at her expressionlessly. “What exactly is it? I’ll close the door if you have nothing to say.”

“Hmph, Senior Qiao is really arrogant. That’s right, Senior Qiao is a popular A-list celebrity now. Senior Qiao naturally doesn’t care about newbies like us. But Senior Qiao, you’re always acting in front of others, aren’t you afraid of others discovering your hypocritical side?”

Qiao Mianmian frowned impatiently. “I’ll say it again. I’ll close the door if you have nothing to say.”

With that, she reached out to close the door.

“Wait, don’t close the door.” Qiao Anxin seemed anxious and reached out to block the door. She bit her lip and looked at Qiao Mianmian with some resentment in her eyes. She asked rudely, “Qiao Mianmian, did you bump into Gong Zeli when you went to the Lan Ya Pavilion today?

“Did you say something to him?”

After Qiao Anxin left the pavilion, she thought for a long time but still couldn’t figure out why Gong Zeli treated her that way.
