Chapter 745: Jealous

As long as she stopped crying, he could do anything.

Her tears were like glass shards that pierced his heart.

Qiao Mianmian looked up at him with eyes still cold and distant. “Mo Yesi, do you think I’m angry about this?”

Mo Yesi was stunned. “... Isn’t it because of this? Then what?”

Qiao Mianmian took a deep breath and wiped her tears. She looked at him and thought for a while before saying, “It has something to do with this, but it’s not entirely because of this. Mo Yesi, do you know how tiring it is to be with someone like you?”

Mo Yesi pursed his lips.

“So, you feel tired being with me?” he asked hoarsely after a moment of silence.

Qiao Mianmian shook her head. “No. Actually, I’m very happy with you.”

The man looked at her in surprise. “But you said you’re tired.”

“Mm, that’s what I said.” Qiao Mianmian nodded. “I mean, I’ll get tired if I spend too much time with you. You... are too controlling and possessive. It’s impossible to not have other men around me.

“Moreover, in my circle and career, I’m destined to be in contact with men in the future. Mo Yesi, I can’t possibly abandon all my friends because of you.

“This isn’t realistic.”

“If it was you, would you be able to do it?”

“Of course I...” Mo Yesi stopped mid-sentence.

Actually, he really wanted to say that he could.

He would do anything for her.

With her around, he didn’t need any friends of the opposite sex.

She was enough in his world.

But he knew that she didn’t want to hear such an answer.

This would only make her feel that he was even more abnormal.

What would a woman think when facing an abnormal man?

She wanted to escape.

“You can’t do it too, right?” Qiao Mianmian misunderstood him. “If you can’t do it yourself, why do you want me to?”

Mo Yesi couldn’t help but ask, “What if... I can do it?”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned for a moment before shaking her head. “I can’t do that. As long as they’re normal people, they’ll have a normal social circle. I can only promise that I won’t have any thoughts of being friends with them. But I can’t do it without any friendship with the opposite sex.”

Every profession had the existence of both sexes.

How was it possible to not have anything to do with each other?

Seeing that she seemed to have calmed down, Mo Yesi hesitantly reached out again. When he felt that she wasn’t avoiding him, he gently and carefully wiped away her tears. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“I didn’t mean to stop you from interacting with men.” He wiped her tears and walked towards her. “I never thought of asking you to do this. Qiao Mianmian, in your heart, am I such an unreasonable person?”

Qiao Mianmian looked at him silently.

He had never made such a request.

In the end, he was so jealous.

He was jealous of the male lead and the director...
