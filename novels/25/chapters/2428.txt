Chapter 2430: No One Is Going Against Money

“Almost all of the spokespeople that C Card used previously was decided by Zhang Feng. In other words, Zhang Feng has a huge say in choosing a spokesperson. If he thinks you’re good, you might really be able to get the perfume endorsement.”

Linda felt that Qiao Mianmian was really lucky.

She actually caught the eye of such a picky person.

He even offered to introduce her.

Not everyone had such luck.

Previously, many superstars had taken the initiative to approach C Card when they were choosing their spokesperson. Many competed to be the spokesperson.

C Card was a top luxury brand.

They had always chosen a popular superstar as their spokesperson.

Being able to get a C Card endorsement was a symbol of power and status in the industry.

C Card was famous for being arrogant and picky. They were willing to approach no more than three artistes.

And those artistes were much better than Qiao Mianmian in every aspect.

Qiao Mianmian was only popular domestically.

And she’d only just risen to the A-list rankings. Her status wasn’t stable enough.

Any spokesperson signed by C Card was an international superstar.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t compare, be it in terms of fame or status.

But since Zhang Feng said that, Qiao Mianmian had a chance.

C Card had never used a domestic artiste before, but that didn’t mean they wouldn’t.

Over the years, many branded products had begun to be endorsed by domestic artistes. This was related to the increasing willingness of the public to spend on luxury goods. According to the statistics of the past two years, the consumption of the citizens of Country A overseas during every Golden Week vacation was rather shocking. Just a few days of consumption could exceed the total consumption of their own citizens for half a year.

As a result, the luxury brands overseas had all trained their employees.

After all, money was king.

No matter how arrogant a brand was, they had to earn money.

No one would go against money.

If C Card wanted to open up the domestic market, they would definitely use domestic artistes in the future.

It’d be meaningful if Qiao Mianmian could become their first spokesperson.

“Mianmian, if you can get this endorsement, this will be very useful for you to expand the international market in the future,” Linda said excitedly.

She’d thought that making Qiao Mianmian a top-tier artiste in the country would fulfill her goal.

But now, this goal seemed to have been easily achieved.

She hadn’t even done anything, but Qiao Mianmian was already a top-tier actress.

Qiao Mianmian was definitely the fastest and easiest artiste she’d ever groomed.

She was just a manager.

Thinking of Qiao Mianmian’s two huge backers, Linda was no longer satisfied with the current situation. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

She wanted Qiao Mianmian to have a place in the international scene.

Moreover, she felt that as long as she had the support of the Mo and Bai families, this could be achieved.

Qiao Mianmian was good and capable.

What was impossible with enough resources?
