Chapter 2858: Already Married, Yet Still Unrestrained

This was a good thing.

No matter who the woman Young Master liked was, as long as he wasn’t obsessed with Young Lady Shen, there was hope for his marriage. He wouldn’t use Young Lady Shen as an excuse to refuse to marry.

But who would have thought that the female celebrity was actually a married woman!

Moreover, she was married to Second Young Master Mo, Young Master’s good friend!

Madam was furious.

How could Young Master like a married woman?

What would it look like if this got out! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Because of this, Madam and Young Master had a huge fight. There was a period of time when the two of them were on bad terms, and Young Master didn’t return to the residence for a long time.

Not long ago, the relationship between the mother and son had eased a little.

Young Master was willing to go home too.

It seemed like it was only a matter of time before the mother and son reconciled.

But…

Young Master actually had a scandal with that female celebrity at this juncture.

He was caught by the reporters in a private clubhouse where the female celebrity was.

Madam only found out about this when one of her best friends called her to verify the truth of the scandal.

After finding out about this, Madam was so angry that her face turned green. She immediately called Young Master back home.

At this point, both mother and son didn’t look too good. They didn’t want to fight again and ruin their relationship.

“Hello, Young Master.” The housemaids greeted him respectfully.

Gong Zeli walked past them expressionlessly and stopped in front of Madam Gong.

He looked down at Madam Gong, who was sitting on the sofa with a cold expression. “Mom, why did you call me back in such a hurry?”

Gong Zeli knew why his mother was looking for him, but he pretended not to know.

His question angered Madam Gong, who had been suppressing her anger.

Sitting elegantly on the sofa, she looked up. Her skin was so fair and smooth that not a single flaw could be seen on her face. Her skin condition and mental state were not inferior to a young girl in her twenties.

At this moment, Madam Gong’s beautiful face was filled with anger as she questioned her son coldly. “Don’t you know why I called you back?”

Gong Zeli smiled coldly. “How would I know if you don’t tell me? I can’t read your mind.”

“You!” Madam Gong was so angry that she grabbed the cushion on the sofa and threw it at him. “Tell me clearly, what’s going on between you and that female celebrity called Qiao Mianmian? Why are you two involved in a scandal again! Someone took a picture of you having a private meeting at a clubhouse. Is this true!”

Gong Zeli caught the cushion easily. He pursed his lips and smiled coldly. “So what if it’s true? So what if it’s not?”

“What do you think!” His casual and nonchalant attitude angered Madam Gong again. She said angrily, “You created such a scandal with a married woman, how will others look at our Gong family? Moreover, that woman is the Mo family’s daughter-in-law. Ever since our families fell out, our Gong Corporation has suffered so much. Do you want us to become enemies?

“I don’t care what kind of woman you play with outside, but why are you touching a married woman? I don’t think that woman surnamed Qiao is a good person. She’s already married, but she still doesn’t know her place. She even seduced an unmarried man like you..”
