Chapter 869: No One Can Touch Her

“What’s there to be afraid of.” Mo Yesi chuckled when he saw how flustered she looked. He then bit her chin and said hoarsely, “Do you think I’ll eat you up? I just asked you to call me Hubby, and you’re already so afraid.”

“Mo Yesi...” Qiao Mianmian looked at him pitifully. “I’m so tired, I want to rest early tonight.”

So, don’t torment me!

Her small body couldn’t withstand his torment for the time being.

The man chuckled again, amused by her pitiful expression. “I didn’t say what I wanted to do. Or are you hinting at me to do something? Actually, I’m very tired and want to rest early too. But if you really want it, I can...”

“No, I don’t want to.”

Qiao Mianmian immediately covered his mouth. “Since I’m tired and you’re tired too, let’s rest early. Get someone to send something up, I’ll shower first.”

“Shower?” Mo Yesi raised an eyebrow as his warm lips touched her palm. “Do you want to join me, I’ll help you scrub your back...”

“... I’ll do it myself!”

“Mm? Are you sure?”

“I’m sure!”

“Alright.” The man sighed. “If you change your mind, you can call me anytime.”

...

Qiao Mianmian came out of the shower and saw Mo Yesi answering a call.

His figure was tall and slender, and he was wearing a black sleeping robe. The figure standing by the window was very attractive.

Qiao Mianmian walked over lightly.

As she walked behind him, she heard him say a name coldly. “Shen Rou? You should ask her what she did. I don’t know what happened between her and Fourth Bro. You asked the wrong person.

“Relationship? I didn’t pursue it on account of our many years of friendship. Otherwise, do you think this matter would be over just like that?

“No matter who it is, you can’t touch her. I’ll put this aside for now. Even if it’s you, if you dare to lay your hands on her, I’ll turn against you. Third Yan, if you’re pleading on her behalf, then you don’t have to speak anymore. I won’t forgive her.

“Because she made an unforgivable mistake. Chance? I gave her a chance, but she didn’t take it seriously.”

“Alright, I don’t want to hear it anymore. If you plead on her behalf again, don’t call me.”

Mo Yesi hung up.

He turned around with a dark expression and saw Qiao Mianmian standing behind him. The ice on his face seemed to melt instantly, and his eyes were filled with warmth.

“You’re done showering?”

He reached out and gently pulled her to the side. Looking at her still wet hair, he held her hand and walked to the bed. “Wait, I’ll get the hairdryer.”

After a while, he brought the hairdryer over and adjusted it before standing by the bed to dry her hair.

Qiao Mianmian sat by the bed and let him do it.

She realized that ever since she married Mo Yesi, he was always the one blowing her hair.

She wasn’t used to it at first.

Now, waiting for him to blow dry her hair had become a habit.

Her hair was soft and silky.

Mo Yesi pinched a strand of her hair between his fingers. When it was almost dry, he couldn’t bear to throw it away.

“Mo Yesi, can I ask you a question?” Qiao Mianmian hesitated for a while and decided to ask him directly.
