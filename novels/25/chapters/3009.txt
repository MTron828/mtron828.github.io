Chapter 3011 A Small Gift Worth Tens of Billions

A gift from the Mo family couldn’t be considered small.

“Keep it.” Mo Yesi crossed his legs elegantly and picked up a cup of freshly brewed coffee. He took a sip and smiled. “This is the Mo family’s rule. Sister-in-law was also rewarded for her pregnancy.”

Qiao Mianmian hesitated for a while before taking it. Inside the briefcase were a bunch of property transfer agreements for luxury cars, shops, and even an office building with more than 30 floors!

Qiao Mianmian looked at the documents in a daze.

This was a small gift?

Gifts that she knew and the Mo family knew seemed too different.

The difference was like heaven and earth! She roughly estimated that the gift Old Madam prepared for her was at least tens of billions. A small gift worth tens of billions…

Qiao Mianmian’s feelings were indescribable.

“Grandma…” She felt her hand burn as she held the documents worth tens of billions. “Isn’t this gift a little too expensive?”

Although she had been married to Mo Yesi for a few years and was even pregnant now, she still couldn’t get used to the Mo family’s wealth.

“This is what you deserve.” Old Madam patted her hand and smiled. “I originally prepared more, but I was afraid that the amount would be too big and you wouldn’t accept it. So, I’ll give you the rest when you give birth.” Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

The amount she was holding was already huge enough.

“Grandma is giving it to you, just take it.” Mo Yesi didn’t seem surprised and said calmly, “Don’t be embarrassed. What you are receiving is nothing to Grandma.

“Grandma, don’t worry.”

“You brat.” Old Madam turned around and glared at him. “Everyone says that raising a son is a waste. You’ve forgotten your mother after getting married. I think you brats are the same. You don’t have a conscience.

“I’ll leave all my money to my granddaughters-in-law in the future! You brats can forget about getting a single cent!”

Mo Yesi drank his coffee slowly and smiled elegantly. “Grandma, don’t forget that Mianmian and I are husband and wife. Whatever you give to Mianmian will be considered as a couple’s shared property. Of course, I’ll have a share too.”

Old Madam was speechless.

Qiao Mianmian glared at him. “Alright, stop talking nonsense with Grandma.”

Mo Yesi looked into her eyes and smiled tenderly. “Alright, Baby. You’re the oldest in our family now, we’ll listen to you.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

This guy was asking for a beating!

Old Madam wasn’t in good health and came to visit Qiao Mianmian. After half an hour, she returned to the Mo Residence.

A while later, Father Bai and Mother Bai came.

The nutritional and health supplements they brought were piled up in the corner of the living room. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

She wouldn’t be able to finish it even if she ate them for a year.

Qiao Mianmian felt that it was too exaggerated.

“Dad, Mom, how could I finish so much? You bought too much.” She was worried that she would be fed like a pig during her pregnancy. “Not much, not much at all.” Mother Bai said from experience, “Your appetite will be greater than usual in pregnancy. You can eat four to five meals a day. That’s how I ate back then.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.
