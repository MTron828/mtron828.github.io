Chapter 1060: She Was Obviously Drunk

Jiang Luoli thought for a while and nodded. “Mm.”

If he didn’t make her happy, her heart wouldn’t beat so wildly.

Mo Shixiu smiled. “As long as Miss Jiang likes it. If Miss Jiang likes to hear me say that, I’ll tell you more in the future.”

Jiang Luoli’s hand trembled again.

Damn.

Again, again...

This man was flirting with her again.

He definitely didn’t know how alluring his words were.

She really believed that he was flirting unconsciously.

“Miss Jiang, what’s wrong?” Mo Shixiu raised an eyebrow when he saw that she was still staring at him blankly. “Did I say something wrong?”

Jiang Luoli replied, “... No.”

The waiter served the other dishes.

This was a very high-end private restaurant. Although it was located halfway up the mountain, it never lacked customers.

The people who came here were all high-ranking officials in Yuncheng City.

In such a place, the chefs were all masters.

The dishes were also very delicious.

A breeze blew in from the window, carrying a faint floral scent.

Besides the strange atmosphere at the start, everything else made Jiang Luoli feel very comfortable.

The food and red wine were delicious.

The music was nice too.

The atmosphere in the restaurant was also very good.

In the end, Jiang Luoli ate and drank a lot.

After dinner, the red wine’s effects started to show.

She started to feel dizzy and her face burned.

Mo Shixiu saw that she didn’t look too well and asked worriedly, “Miss Jiang, are you alright?”

He didn’t expect Jiang Luoli to drink so much.

She drank half of the bottle of red wine.

The red wine was strong, and he didn’t dare to drink too much.

Jiang Luoli rubbed her temple and looked up at him. “I’m fine. Just let me rest for a while.”

She was just a little dizzy.

She would be fine after resting for a while.

Mo Shixiu had no choice but to sit with her for a few minutes. Every two or three minutes, he would ask her, “Miss Jiang, are you alright? Are you drunk? Do you need me to get someone to get you something to sober up?”

“I’m not drunk.” Jiang Luoli felt her head spinning. She glared at Mo Shixiu and said unhappily, “How could I be drunk? I can drink another bottle.”

Her cheeks were red and her eyes were obviously blurred.

She was obviously drunk.

But drunk people liked to say that they weren’t drunk.

They would get angry with whoever told them that they were drunk.

Jiang Luoli was in this state now.

“Mo Shixiu, let me tell you, I’m really not drunk!” She rubbed her temple that was still hurting and yelled at the man opposite her unhappily. “I only drank that little, how could I be drunk?

“I’m not drunk, I’m really not drunk.

“I can drink more. If you don’t believe me, let’s drink another bottle.”

Mo Shixiu frowned.

Still not drunk?

She always called him Mr. Mo when she was sober.

But now she addressed him by his full name. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

She was obviously drunk.

Mo Shixiu blamed himself.

If he’d known that she could hold her liquor this well, he wouldn’t have believed that she could drink so much.
