Chapter 2499: Maybe Someone Already Saw Her

“I’ve never hated her.” Gong Zeli’s voice was still calm, and so were his eyes.

“You don’t hate her? Then why were you so mean to her previously? Alright, if it’s because of Shen Rou, then shouldn’t the person you like be Shen Rou? What exactly happened? Your heart suddenly changed?

“Is there something I don’t know?”

Yan Shaoqing was especially curious about this.

He had been Gong Zeli’s friend for many years, so he naturally knew that he had always liked Shen Rou.

Gong Zeli wouldn’t change his mind so easily.

His sudden alienation of Shen Rou and his feelings for Qiao Mianmian were incomprehensible.

Gong Zeli looked at him. “Why are you so worried? It has nothing to do with you.”

Yan Shaoqing was speechless.

He took a deep breath and said, “Alright, alright, I won’t worry about it. It’s fine if you don’t want to say it. I don’t care who you like. Actually, I don’t care if you find a substitute, this has nothing to do with me. But at this juncture, don’t you think you’ll be harming Sis-in-law by finding a substitute?” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Gong Zeli’s expression finally changed.

He was stunned. “What do you mean? This… has nothing to do with her?”

“You don’t know?” Yan Shaoqing frowned.

“Know what?” Gong Zeli was confused.

“A lot of Sister-in-law’s scandals were exposed today.” Yan Shaoqing saw that he really didn’t know, so he didn’t keep him in suspense. He said, “Someone who claims to know us and is very close to us revealed a lot of scandals about Sis-in-law.

“One of the scandals is about you and Sis-in-law. He said that Sis-in-law seduced you to drive a wedge between us and Shen Rou. You were bewitched by her and became her henchman. Sis-in-law was the one who told you to alienate Shen Rou. She was also the one who told you to not help the Shen Corporation.”

Gong Zeli’s expression darkened.

His eyes were cold as if they were frozen. “When did this happen? Why are you only telling me now?”

Yan Shaoqing was speechless.

What did he mean by only telling him now?

He didn’t ask.

Moreover, was there a need for him to say it?

As a person who didn’t like to gossip, his cell phone was constantly being shown on the news today. Even if he didn’t want to know, he couldn’t help but see it.

And this matter had blown up.

He’d always thought that Gong Zeli knew.

But it appeared he didn’t.

“Just what happened today. The news is all over the place, you just didn’t pay attention to it. Zeli, many people believe the scandal between you and Sis-in-law, and now Sis-in-law is being scolded like a dog.

“If someone with a heart saw the little girl you brought along this time, what would they think? Even if there’s nothing between the two of you, would others believe it? You already have a substitute by your side, would others still believe that there’s nothing between the two of you?

“Maybe someone has already seen her. I don’t know what’s wrong with Second Bro. He actually let the negative news hang on Weibo’s hot searches. Didn’t he see it too?”
