On the other side.

Madam Gong frowned and said angrily, “He hung up on me again. I’ve been so worried about him that I can’t sleep well, but he doesn’t care at all.

“He suggested it himself, but I don’t think he has such intentions.

“Mom, help me persuade Zeli too. He has respected you the most since he was young and has a deep relationship with you. He’ll definitely listen to you.” Madam Gong

looked at an old lady sitting beside her anxiously.

Old Madam’s hair was white, but she looked very energetic. Her clothes weren’t luxurious, but she had a calm temperament.

She was Gong Zeli’s grandmother.

Previously, she had been living in a Daoist temple, cultivating her body and mind. Occasionally, she would go down the mountain to see her family.

Old Madam had already heard about her grandson from Madam Gong.

After hearing what Madam Gong said, she didn’t seem too anxious. She continued counting the prayer beads in her hand and said calmly, “What are you anxious about? Zeli

is still young. It’s not too late to talk about marriage in a few years.

“Moreover, with our Gong family’s background, not to mention that he’s only in his twenties, even if he’s 40 years old and still unmarried, he won’t have to worry about not

finding an outstanding woman as his wife.”

Madam Gong said, “Yes, Mom, you’re right. With the Gong family’s background, we don’t have to worry about this. But what I’m worried about now isn’t that Zeli can’t find

an outstanding wife. I’m worried that he doesn’t want to find one at all.

“What will we do if he doesn’t want to marry?

“The Gong family had only one heir in this generation. Mom, you don’t want the Gong family to die out in Zeli’s generation, right!”

Old Madam frowned when she heard the words “die out”. “How is it so serious? He’s just young and playful. After a few years, he’ll be mature and naturally want to form his

own family.”

“If that’s the case, I don’t have anything to worry about. Mom, since we’re already at this point, I won’t hide it from you. Do you know that Zeli is obsessed with a woman

now?

“And a married woman at that!

“I’m afraid that Zeli won’t be able to let go of her. What should I do!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Old Madam’s expression changed, and she stopped counting her prayer beads. She said in shock, “Zeli is obsessed with a married woman? What exactly is going on?”

Madam Gong didn’t want Old Madam to worry about this, but for her son’s marriage, she could only tell her everything she knew.

A moment later.

Old Madam was no longer as calm as before. She said with a serious expression, “If Zeli really doesn’t care about other women because of this, we have to persuade him.”

Madam Gong said happily, “Mom, are you willing to help me persuade Zeli?”

Old Madam’s words were more effective than hers.

Gong Zeli might not listen to her, but he would definitely listen to Old Madam.

“Give Zeli a call later and tell him that I’m not feeling too well. He’ll definitely come back.” Old Madam thought for a while and said, “I’ll talk to him when he comes back.”

Qiao Mianmian walked to the window in her bathrobe.

The island at night was especially beautiful.

Even though the wedding was simple, she still felt tired after it ended..
