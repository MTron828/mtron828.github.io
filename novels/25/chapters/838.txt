Chapter 839: Her Hubby Is Too Cute

This man was really good to her.

She thought that even if he changed in the future, he wouldn’t treat her so well.

But she wouldn’t regret it.

At least he’d given her a period of happiness. She’d be happy during this period.

...

After getting off the car.

They took the elevator to the shopping district upstairs.

It wasn’t the weekend, so there were fewer people around.

Qiao Mianmian quickly found a shop that sold eye masks. He pulled Mo Yesi over to pick a few that suited his style, but he rejected them all.

After being rejected four times in a row, Qiao Mianmian lost her composure.

She looked up at Mo Yesi. “You don’t like any of them?”

Mo Yesi’s usual style was simple.

He mostly liked black, white, and gray colors.

Hence, Qiao Mianmian chose the simplest black eye mask for him. She thought that it would be easy and would be done very quickly, but after more than 10 minutes, he still didn’t like any.

Mo Yesi looked down at the eye mask hanging at the side and kept quiet for a while before saying calmly, “I don’t really like it.”

“Then, which one do you like?”

Qiao Mianmian was a little confused.

The men’s eye masks were about the same, not clothes or shoes. There were different styles to choose from.

Mo Yesi kept quiet for a while before saying gently, “I think it’s pretty good to get three for 10 yuan.”

Qiao Mianmian was confused.

The man’s voice was still gentle. “It looks rather cute.”

“...”

“I want that.”

“...”

“Let’s go, there’s nothing I want here.”

“...”

20 minutes later.

After shopping around the mall, the two of them returned to the car.

Qiao Mianmian turned on her cell phone and entered the Taobao shop where she bought eye masks. She found the shop and showed the masks to Mo Yesi one by one. “I think this bear eye mask is rather cute, what do you think?

“This kitten is not bad, either.

“How about this panda?”

The man was very picky.

Even if it was a 10 yuan eye mask, he still spent half a day choosing it.

In the end, he picked out a cartoon eye mask and said to Qiao Mianmian, “I think this one is good.”

Qiao Mianmian was getting tired of dealing with him. Seeing that he was finally done, she casually glanced at it and immediately nodded. “I think this is pretty good too. Then, this is it?”

“This one is not bad, either.”

Mo Yesi then pointed at another Mickey Mouse blindfold with a bow. “Use this next time, I’ll use that Donald Duck.”

Qiao Mianmian looked at the Mickey Mouse he was pointing at and almost burst out laughing.

Everyone knew that Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck were a couple.

So, this was the reason why he couldn’t pick it.

She felt that... Mo Yesi was too adorable sometimes.

Like a child.

When she was with him, she almost forgot what he was supposed to be like.

She pretended not to know what he was thinking and nodded cooperatively. “Mm, this is pretty good too. But are you sure you want to buy such a cheap eye mask?”

Which of the items he bought for her weren’t luxury brands?

Which one was cheaper?

She was a little embarrassed to give him something worth 10 yuan.

“Mm.”
