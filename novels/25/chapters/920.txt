Chapter 921: You Promised Me You Wouldn’t Get Angry

Mo Yesi raised an eyebrow. “Feel?”

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian nodded. “It feels like it. Anyway, I’m sure he doesn’t have any feelings for me. You won’t understand this feeling, but I believe I won’t make a mistake.”

Mo Yesi was speechless.

“Oh, right.” At the mention of Bai Yusheng, Qiao Mianmian suddenly thought of his birthday party. She hesitated for a while and carefully said, “Brother Bai’s birthday is in a few days. He invited me to it.

“You’ll be there that night too, right?”

Mo Yesi nodded. “Mm, he invited me.”

Bai Yusheng never used to hold birthday banquets.

It was his 30th birthday this year, so the meaning was slightly different.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Hence, the Bai family decided to hold a grand birthday party for him.

Everyone in Yuncheng City was invited.

People like Mo Yesi were invited too.

Qiao Mianmian hesitated for a few seconds before whispering, “Can I discuss something with you? But you have to promise me first that you won’t get angry.”

Mo Yesi replied, “... Alright.”

Qiao Mianmian thought about what to say. After a while, she looked at him and said slowly, “That night, I might not be able to attend with you. Even if we pretend not to know each other, you know that the contract I signed has a rule that I can’t publicize my relationship now, so...”

Before she could finish, she could already feel the man’s anger.

She looked at him pitifully. “You promised me you wouldn’t get angry...”

Mo Yesi was speechless.

He did promise her, and he could understand her.

But he felt aggrieved.

He felt especially aggrieved.

She was his wife, but she had to pretend not to know him when they appeared at the same banquet.

This made him feel like her secret lover.

She couldn’t be exposed.

“I’m sorry.” Qiao Mianmian knew that this request was a little overboard. “The company’s request, I... have no choice.

“Hubby, I’ll have to trouble you.

“I know you’re the best. You won’t get angry with me. You understand, right?”

Qiao Mianmian knew how Mo Yesi liked her the most.

She knew what he liked to hear from her.

As she hugged him and acted coquettishly, she saw that the man’s expression had softened. He wasn’t as angry as before.

Seeing that this tactic worked, Qiao Mianmian quickly said coquettishly, “Hubby, don’t be angry. It’s not like I haven’t been disclosing it to you. It’s just that the situation is special now, can you cooperate with me?

“You’re the best. You’re the best husband in the world.”

Mo Yesi pursed his lips. Although he still looked unmoved, there was a faint smile in his eyes.

Qiao Mianmian hugged his arm and called him Hubby again.

A moment later, she heard the man beside her sigh helplessly. “Alright, stop flattering me. I promise you.”

...

With Qiao Mianmian’s addition, the meal was finally ready after an hour.

Mo Yesi really didn’t know how to cook.

He had no talent for cooking.

He almost fried the last two steaks.

In the end, with Qiao Mianmian’s help, the steak was barely edible, but it looked terrible.
