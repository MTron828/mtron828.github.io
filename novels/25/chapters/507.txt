Chapter 508: He Was Too Much

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

He was still a hunk whom people would take second looks at on the streets.

But he hadn’t had a single relationship in those four years of university.

Even after graduation and entering the Mo Corporation, he had remained single.

When he was studying, grades were the most important to him.

When he started working, his job was the most important to him.

He never really thought about love or relationships and didn’t have much interest in it.

But now...

Seeing how much his Boss had changed after getting married, Wei Zheng suddenly felt like being in love too.

He wanted to know how his life would change after falling in love with someone. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Would life be more wonderful?

His lifestyle had been the same for so many years, it was getting... boring.

...

After giving Wei Zheng the call, Mo Yesi went into the lounge to check on Qiao Mianmian.

Only a few minutes had passed, but the little girl was already sleeping on the bed.

Her lashes were very long and lush, and she looked almost like a doll from where he was.

The more he looked at her, the more perfect she looked. She sometimes didn’t seem like a real person.

Her fair skin made it even harder for him to resist her.

But it was also because she was so fair that the marks left on her were so obvious. He was too rough and wild just now and had left quite some marks on her.

The bruises all over made it seem as if she’d been abused.

It was rather startling.

Mo Yesi looked at her for a while and scolded himself for being a beast.

How could he treat his baby this way?

He was too much.

Now that he was rational again, he really felt that he’d gone too far.

He was finally reflecting on himself.

But he seemed to have forgotten that in the heat of the moment, her pitiful and teary eyes only stimulated him further.

He didn’t think of himself as a beast at all at that time.

Mo Yesi sat on the edge of the bed very cautiously and stroked her cheek.

He whispered, “Baby, I’m sorry. Forgive me for my lack of self-control. In the future... I’ll be more careful.”

She was already asleep, so she didn’t hear a thing.

But Qiao Mianmian would discover later that it wouldn’t have made a difference even if she had heard him.

Because he was always so serious and sincere when he made promises.

But when the time came and he was in the mood, all of those promises would be forgotten.

He was going to be a beast, over and over again.

Mo Yesi sat by the bedside and watched Qiao Mianmian for a while before recalling that there was still a pile of documents for him to attend to. He reluctantly stood up and prepared to get to work.

Just as he was about to leave her bedside, her cell phone screen lit up by the pillow.

Mo Yesi didn’t have to go closer to see the message that Jiang Luoli had sent.

Jiang Luoli: [Baby, a relative of mine is here in Yuncheng City, and she brought me a lot of local products from where she came from. Where are you now, when will you be back in school? I packed some for you, so you can brew it for Prince Charming. I heard that it’s really good for men and their constitution. Didn’t you say that Prince Charming didn’t last long? Maybe this will help that.]
