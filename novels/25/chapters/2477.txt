Chapter 2478: Untitled

There was a new group of fake reviewers.

This group of people seemed different from the previous ones. Many of Qiao Anxin’s fans were among them.

Ever since all sorts of Qiao Anxin’s scandals were exposed, her image had completely collapsed. She couldn’t continue in the entertainment industry and vanished.

No one knew where she went.

Some of her fans announced their withdrawal after seeing her true colors.

But Qiao Anxin also had loyal fans.

Even though she was covered in scandals and her image was ruined, a portion of her fans still claimed that no matter what kind of person she was, they would forever be her fans and support her.

They were waiting for Qiao Anxin to change and return to the entertainment industry.

Many people still insisted on leaving comments on Qiao Anxin’s posts.

Her fan club was still running. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

When these loyal fans saw Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi’s marriage certificate, they pointed out the date of their registration and said Qiao Anxin did not interfere in Su Ze and Qiao Mianmian’s relationship.

The person who cheated on her was Qiao Mianmian.

“I checked the date on the marriage certificate. Qiao Mianmian broke up with Su Ze less than a week before she married another man. Why do I feel like she broke up with Su Ze long ago?”

“That’s right. She must have found a partner long ago. She must have gotten together with Mo Yesi before she even broke up with Su Ze. She was the one who shamelessly found a better man and wanted to dump her ex-boyfriend, but she said that Sister Anxin broke her relationship with Su Ze. I knew Sister Anxin wouldn’t do such a thing. She’s such a kind and innocent girl, but she was schemed against by her sister and accused of being the third party. Now, the truth is out. Sister Anxin is innocent. Qiao Mianmian is shameless and cheated on Sister Anxin!”

“Qiao Mianmian is too scary. Sister Anxin used to chat with us in the group occasionally and talk to us about her sister. Back then, Sister Anxin even told us that she had a good relationship with Qiao Mianmian and that she liked her very much. Sister Anxin treated her like family, I didn’t expect her to treat Sister Anxin like this! How could there be such a disgusting woman? Sister Anxin has left the industry because of her!”

“Actually, now that I think about it, the scandals that were exposed back then are probably fake too. With Qiao Mianmian’s power, she can totally find someone who looks like Sister Anxin to film those videos. Anyway, no one dares to expose her. When I think about how Sister Anxin was actually harmed by this despicable and shameless slut, I feel so hateful. Sister Anxin is clearly such a warm and beautiful person. Boohoo, I really miss Sister Anxin.”

“I miss her too. I think she’s the victim. Qiao Mianmian is too scary. Su Ze and Anxin were both hurt by her. The Su Corporation was acquired and Anxin disappeared from the entertainment industry. One is her sister, and the other is her childhood friend. She doesn’t even care about them. How could she be so cruel?”

Qiao Anxin’s fans seemed to have already confirmed that Qiao Anxin was framed by Qiao Mianmian. Some fans started to denounce Qiao Mianmian on Weibo, asking her to get out of the entertainment industry. They wanted to seek justice for Qiao Anxin.
