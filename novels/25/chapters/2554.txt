Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Upstairs.

Father Shen heard the commotion and quickly went downstairs.

Madam Shen ran to the door of the hall. In a daze, she tripped when she stepped over the threshold.

Madam Shen fell to the ground.

Already downstairs, Father Shen quickly ran to her side and reached out to help her up.

“Old Master, Old Master…” When Father Shen went to help Madam Shen, he realized that she was trembling and her face was pale.

“What’s going on? What happened?” Father Shen was shocked.

Madam Shen gripped his arm tightly and opened her mouth. Tears rolled down her cheeks.

“Rourou, Rourou was in a car accident.” Madam Shen sobbed into her husband’s arms. She hugged Father Shen and said, “Just now, the police called me and said that Rourou was in a car accident. She’s now in the hospital.

“The police said that Rourou’s condition is critical. Master, I’m so afraid. If anything happens to Rourou, I-I don’t want to live anymore.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“What?!” Father Shen’s expression changed. “Rourou was in a car accident?”

Madam Shen was so upset that she couldn’t say a word.

Father Shen was stunned. “How could this be? How could this be…”

…

11:00 PM.

Many netizens didn’t believe the news that Shen Rou was in a car accident and in a critical condition in the hospital.

They felt that the marketing account was talking nonsense to gain attention.

“This news is too fake. The current marketing accounts really dare to post such fake news in order to gain attention. Previously, these marketing accounts even praised Shen Rou to the skies. Now, she’s being stepped on by the entire Internet. Although the netizens don’t like Shen Rou, these marketing accounts are too disgusting. They can change their attitude so quickly.”

“When you see this news, you can’t help but burst out. Anyway, it’s up to you whether you believe it or not. I have a friend at the hospital. He just sent me a WeChat message saying that a rich second-generation heir was indeed seriously injured in a car accident and is being resuscitated in their hospital. The injured person is a woman whose surname is Shen. If nothing’s wrong, it should be Shen Rou.”

“Me too. My friend is from the police station. She told me that Shen Rou really got into a car accident. But she courted death. She was speeding on the expressway when she met a huge truck changing lanes. She didn’t have the time to brake and crashed into it. I saw the video of the accident. The front of the car was deformed. I heard that she was covered in blood when she was carried out. It was scary.”

“It’s true, it’s not fake news! I was in the hospital and saw Shen Rou get into the ambulance with my own eyes! She’s seriously injured, and it’s hard to say if she can be saved. Sigh, she’s so beautiful and so young, what’s there to pity? But she really courted death. She drove as fast as she could on the expressway. If she was driving normally, this accident wouldn’t have happened. No matter what, I hope she can be saved.”

“So, it’s Young Lady Shen. Our car was behind her at that time, and we were five to six meters away. We saw her sports car hit the big truck with our own eyes. She really drove very quickly.. I even told my husband that if the car drove so quickly, it might suffer an accident.”
