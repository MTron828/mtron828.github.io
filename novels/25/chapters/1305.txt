Chapter 1308: What’s There to Fear About Me?

His suit pants were also crumpled.

It had only been less than half a month since she last saw him.

But he looked at least five years older.

If Qiao Mianmian hadn’t known him for so many years, she probably wouldn’t have recognized him.

After all, Su Ze had always been a gentleman in front of her.

“Qiao Mianmian, you don’t want to see me that much?” Su Ze’s expression darkened when he saw that she wanted to close the door.

His eyes were filled with anger. “Am I a plague to you?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Qiao Mianmian could tell that Su Ze was in a bad mood. She glared at him and asked, “How did you know I was here? What are you doing here?”

“Why am I here?” Su Ze looked at her for a while and suddenly smiled. “Mianmian, if I said that I miss you, really miss you, that I wanted to see you, would you believe me?”

Su Ze’s gaze landed on the girl’s exquisite and elegant face. He looked at her greedily for a while, and his heart couldn’t help but itch.

Qiao Mianmian was the first woman he was attracted to.

She was also his first girlfriend.

He still remembered the first time he saw her. She was only eight or nine.

But she was already beautiful.

Back then, he felt that she was much prettier than the girls around him.

The most beautiful girl in their class was nothing compared to her.

Back then, he secretly thought that he would definitely marry her when he grew up.

Then, she grew up.

She got prettier and prettier.

Naturally, more and more people liked her.

He was one of them.

Later on, he became her boyfriend. At first, he treated her like a gem.

If he liked a woman, he naturally wanted her.

He’d thought about it before, but she always rejected him.

Although it was understandable and he admired her self-respect and self-love, it would inevitably dampen his spirits if he was rejected too many times.

Hence, he couldn’t reject Qiao Anxin’s offer.

Later, she found out about him and Qiao Anxin and broke up with him.

To Su Ze, his biggest regret was not being able to have her.

Even if it was only once, he’d be satisfied.

Although she might not be clean anymore, he still wanted her.

At this thought, Su Ze narrowed his eyes and looked at Qiao Mianmian differently.

Qiao Mianmian’s expression darkened when she heard his shameless words. “Su Ze, have you forgotten your lesson? I’ll make you regret it if you say such shameless words again.

“I don’t care what you’re here for. Leave now, and I’ll pretend nothing happened. Otherwise...”

“Otherwise, what will you do?” Su Ze sneered. He didn’t seem to take her words seriously. Not only did he not leave, he even took a step forward.

He never took his eyes off Qiao Mianmian. “Mianmian, do you think I still care about this? I already have nothing, what’s there to be afraid of?”
