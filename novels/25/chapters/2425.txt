In other words, he wouldn’t design anything for anyone.

This wasn’t just someone they couldn’t hire, they couldn’t even find him.

Soon, the topic #Mysterious MR.S# was trending.

…

Qiao Mianmian was filming a jewelry commercial.

She had shot a few commercials previously and already had relevant experience, so the morning shoot progressed very quickly. Almost all the scenes were done in one shot.

After she finished the last scene in the morning, the director gave her an “OK” sign and praised her performance.

“Mianmian, you’re really good at taking photos. I thought it would take at least four hours to finish the morning shoot, but it ended an hour earlier.

The director gave her a thumbs up, and his eyes were full of admiration. “This is the first time an artiste passed all the scenes in one shot. I hope that after this cooperation ends, we can still work together in the future.”

Qiao Mianmian immediately smiled and accepted the offer. “Thank you for your praise, Director Zhang. I’m very honored to be able to work with such an outstanding director. I hope we can continue working together in the future.”

The director for this commercial was him. His name was Zhang Feng.

Zhang Feng was a rather famous advertisement director internationally. He was also a director of many luxury brands’ commercials. The advertisements produced by him were comparable to blockbusters. They were very high-end. Moreover, like Henry Zhou, he was an especially proud person. He wasn’t easy to hire.

He rarely filmed commercials for domestic artistes.

Usually, only international superstars could get him.

Previously, Qin Han had taken on an advertisement for a luxury brand watch. And Zhang Feng was the director.

Qin Han’s fans bragged about it for a long time.

Because he was the first domestic artiste that Zhang Feng worked with.

Hence, Qin Han’s fans had the right to boast about it.

This was indeed enviable.

And now, Mo Yesi had invited Zhang Feng to shoot an advertisement for Qiao Mianmian. Her treatment was considered unique among female artistes.

Not only that.

Mo Yesi was really generous this time.

Qiao Mianmian’s clothes and accessories were all expensive.

The lighting artist, the photographer, the makeup artist, the image designer, and everyone in the team were top figures in their fields.

Just this commercial alone cost hundreds of millions.

Zhang Feng was a very proud person. Qiao Mianmian didn’t know how Mo Yesi managed to invite him this time, but since Zhang Feng offered her an olive branch, she definitely couldn’t ask for more.

Not everyone had such an opportunity to gain his recognition.

Zhang Feng smiled and nodded. “Previously, Card C wanted to shoot the perfume advertisement for the season, but I haven’t found a suitable person. If you’re willing, I can recommend you. I just don’t know…” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Thank you, Director Zhang.” Qiao Mianmian looked happy and immediately replied, “I’ve always had a good impression of Card C.. If Director Zhang can introduce me, that would be great. But will this trouble you?”
