“Mianmian and I both feel that we don’t need to invite too many unrelated people to our wedding, It’s fine as long as we have the blessings of our family and friends. We plan to keep a low profile.” Mo Yesi told them about his and Qiao Mianmian’s plans. “Besides, we don’t want our wedding to be

broadcasted on the news, so we’re not going to invite any reporters.

“We’ve told Big Brother and Sister-in-law about this, and they agree.”

“If we don’t invite the reporters or more guests, does that mean that we are just doing it ourselves?” Madam Bai seemed a little unhappy about this.

She wanted a big party.

She always felt that she owed Qiao Mianmian.

Even if she gave her a lot of material compensation, it was still far from enough.

The twenty years of familial ties that had been lost could not be made up for with materialistic compensation.

A once-in-a-lifetime wedding was very important.

Which girl did not want a grand and luxurious wedding?

Back in the day, her wedding had caused a sensation, and countless people were envious.

Back then, the Bai family was not as wealthy as it was now, but Father Bai had never wronged her during the wedding.

“I’ve prepared for this wedding for more than a year. I definitely won’t let Mianmian suffer.”

“Tm not afraid that you’ll mistreat her.” Madam Bai looked at her daughter lovingly.

“However, since you two have your own ideas, as elders, we can’t force you.”

“Mom, I don’t want unrelated people at my wedding.” Qiao Mianmian sat beside her mother and held her arm. She said coyly, “Yesi had the same intentions as you. He wanted to have a lively wedding, but I told him not to invite too many people.

“You said that marriage is a once-in-a-lifetime event. Since that’s the case, I should be happy and do whatever I want. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that.”

“Okay, okay.” Madam Bai patted her hand and said dotingly, “Do as you like. I’m just giving you some advice, you can ignore me.”

“Who said a wedding can only be held once in a lifetime?” Mo Yesi looked at Qiao Mianmian affectionately. “We can hold it every year as long as you’re willing.

“I’s not a silver wedding, a golden one, or even a diamond one.”

‘Madam Bai was very satisfied with his words.

She smiled and said, “That’s true. No one said that a wedding can only be held once. As long as you’re a young couple, you can hold it every year.”
