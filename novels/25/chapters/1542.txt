Chapter 1543: Argument

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The housemaid was stunned. She looked at Old Madam, then at Madam Mo, whose face had turned pale. She lowered her eyes and said respectfully, “Yes, Old Madam.”

Old Madam was really domineering this time.

This wasn’t up to Madam Mo.

Whether she was willing or not, Old Madam didn’t want her to stay here anymore.

Madam Mo felt embarrassed in front of the juniors and housemaids. She stood up with a pale face and trembled with anger. “There’s no need to go through so much trouble. Since you don’t want to see me and think I’m superfluous, I’ll leave now.

“I’ll leave this house. No one in the house welcomes me, anyway. I’m an eyesore here.

“I’ll go, I’ll go now!”

After yelling angrily, Madam Mo turned around and ran away with reddened eyes.

Ten minutes later.

Madam Mo got a bodyguard to carry her luggage and walked down coldly.

They walked to the lobby.

Old Madam looked at the luggage the bodyguard was carrying, her face darkened. “Wenpei, what are you doing? Where are you going with the luggage?”

Madam Mo turned around. “Mom, don’t you find me an eyesore? Don’t you think my presence will affect your family’s harmony? If I leave, it won’t affect anything, right? You don’t have to worry that I’ll stop your grandson and granddaughter-in-law from coming back.”

Old Madam was furious. She didn’t expect Madam Mo to be so willful at such an old age.

And do something so childish and ridiculous.

She actually wanted to leave home.

Madam Mo left quickly.

There was a minute or two of silence in the hall.

Old Madam was so angry that her breathing quickened. Uncle Zhang quickly took out her medicine and poured her a glass of warm water.

Old Madam’s emotions slowly calmed down.

But she still couldn’t help but say, “I’m so angry. Ah Si, did you see how your mom is now? Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“This is all because of your dad. I told him long ago that your mom can’t be pampered, but he didn’t listen to me.

“Now, he has spoiled your mom so much. Does she even have the dignity of an elder? Mianmian and Chen Chen are still here, and there are so many people in the hall. She really embarrassed herself!”

Seeing that Old Madam’s breathing was a little unstable again, Uncle Zhang immediately said, “Old Madam, don’t be too angry. Be careful of your body. It’s not like you don’t know Madam’s personality. Perhaps she left the house in a moment of anger.

“When Madam calms down, she’ll definitely come back. Then, she’ll realize that she didn’t do well and apologize to Old Madam.”

“Who wants her apology? Do I need her to apologize to me?” Old Madam panted heavily. “I feel like I’ve let these children suffer.”

“Grandma, Chen Chen and I aren’t aggrieved.” Qiao Mianmian was afraid that Old Madam would become too angry and immediately held her hand to persuade her gently. “Isn’t Grandma still doting on us? We came back this time mainly to see you.

“Alright, Grandma, don’t be angry. You said that you got the kitchen to make Chen Chen and my favorite dishes. Can we eat now? I think I’m a little hungry.”

Qiao Mianmian gave Qiao Chen a look.

Qiao Chen understood and immediately nodded in agreement. “Grandma, I think I’m a little hungry too. Is there any braised lion’s head in the kitchen? I really want to eat it now.”
