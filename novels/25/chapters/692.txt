Chapter 695: They Don’t Have That Kind of Thoughts About You

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Michael, you...”

Tu Yilei frowned when he heard what Michael said. “What nonsense are you talking about? You’re scaring her.”

“I’m talking nonsense?” Michael sneered and glared at him. “How am I talking nonsense? Don’t you know what your fans are like? When they go crazy, they can even give birth to eighteen generations of your ancestors.

“I told her to stay away from you for her own good.

“If you think I said too much, you shouldn’t have said all this to her. Alright, I won’t say it again.”

With that, Michael turned his head away with a straight face.

Tu Yilei frowned. “Michael, I don’t mean to blame you.”

“Erm, Mr. Tu...” Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but feel a little guilty when she saw how unhappy they were with each other. She decided to leave quickly. “Actually, I think your manager is right. He did it for my own and for your own good.

“I don’t want your fans to think that a newbie is trying to gain popularity with you. I’m also afraid that they’ll misunderstand and go after me. So, um... I’ll get going first.”

With that, Qiao Mianmian ran off.

She ran so quickly that she couldn’t be seen anymore.

It was as if she was afraid of being involved with him.

Tu Yilei pursed his lips as he watched her leave.

The other female artistes were all trying to gain from his popularity.

But she was avoiding him.

Was she so afraid of being involved with him because of her boyfriend?

She didn’t want her boyfriend to be angry at the news?

She... really loved her boyfriend, right?

He had to admit that he was envious and jealous.

“Little Tu Tu, did you see that? She doesn’t have that sort of feeling for you.” Michael didn’t seem to notice Tu Yilei’s darkened expression and continued adding fuel to the fire. “She has a good relationship with her boyfriend.”

“Shut up.”

“I won’t. I just want you to see the truth.” Michael sneered. “I told you so much last night, but you didn’t listen to me. Hmph, just continue with your wishful thinking. She won’t even look at you.

“You’re suffering from unrequited love every day, but she’s so sweet to her boyfriend.”

“Michael, I told you to shut up!”

“Alright, if you have some backbone, I won’t say it again. But can you?” Thinking about how he’d agreed to everything she’d said to him last night, and how he couldn’t help but look for her today, Michael was furious.

How spineless.

How did he manage to groom such a weak artiste?

Having been in the entertainment industry for so many years, he was already a wily old fox, but he actually fell in love with a little girl at first sight.

And he was sad for her.

How embarrassing.

If it wasn’t for the fact that he was the one who brought this brat up, he wouldn’t have bothered about him.

Tu Yilei clenched his fists tightly and kept quiet.

He was willing to let go...

He used to be such a person.

But now, could he really take it lying down and say that he didn’t like her? VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

It seemed like... he couldn’t do it.

He thought he could do it last night.
