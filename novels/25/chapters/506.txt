Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Outside the office.

When Wei Zheng got a call from Mo Yesi, asking him to get a new set of women’s clothes, he had an odd expression.

Just a while ago, he had heard a few female secretaries discussing Chairman Mo and Young Madam.

But he felt that it was impossible.

This wasn’t Chairman Mo’s style.

If he heard that it was Young Master Yan, he wouldn’t be surprised at all.

After all, Young Master Yan did the most absurd things. This wouldn’t be a surprise.

But how could Chairman Mo do something like this?

It wasn’t that Chairman Mo was all noble or anything. But it seemed like such an act would be something absurd to Chairman Mo himself.

Moreover, Chairman Mo surely had more self-control than this.

Hence, when he heard the few secretaries discussing just now, he had actually told them off.

They had to beg him not to let Mo Yesi know about their gossip and speculations.

Otherwise, they were doomed.

Upset as he was by their behavior, he didn’t think of exposing them to Mo Yesi.

Given Chairman Mo’s temper, he’d surely fire them if he found out that they were talking about him and Young Madam behind his back.

Wei Zheng was on good terms with the female secretaries. He wouldn’t be so heartless to them.

But now...

Having gotten that call from Mo Yesi, Wei Zheng was in a state of shock.

It was as if his world of certainty was in chaos now.

Young Madam’s clothes were alright when she went into the Chairman’s office.

But now, Chairman Mo wanted him to get her a brand new set of clothes?

And he meant a full set—even the undergarments.

It wasn’t hard to guess what happened to Young Madam.

He couldn’t believe Chairman Mo was such a person.

Wei Zheng thought about how cold and serious Mo Yesi looked usually, and how much discipline he exercised. It really was hard to associate the words “freedom” and “wildness” with his Boss.

Were married men all like that?

Including Chairman Mo?

Sigh.

Chairman Mo changed so much after getting married.

He was doing a lot of things that he wouldn’t have done before, including the things that were averse to him.

Was the power of love this magical?

Could it really change people so much?

Wei Zheng had been a studious nerd since he was in university. All he knew of life was studying.

Studying brought him joy, energy, and purpose in life.

He hadn’t even thought about getting into a relationship.

Actually, Wei Zheng himself did have suitors back in school.

Although he wasn’t as outstanding as Mo Yesi, he was a really good catch compared to other average men.
