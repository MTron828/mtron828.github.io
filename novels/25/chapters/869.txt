She didn’t want to speculate.

“Mm? Baby, what do you want to ask?”

“I heard you on the phone with Yan Shaoqing?”

“Mm, Third Yan called me and I chatted with him for a while.”

“Erm, I didn’t mean to eavesdrop. I just happened to hear you guys talking about Shen Rou. Can I know what happened to her?”

Mo Yesi was stunned.

Qiao Mianmian saw his reaction and said, “If it’s not convenient to say, pretend I didn’t ask.”

“It’s not inconvenient.” Mo Yesi turned off the hairdryer and placed it on the bedside table. He then stroked her soft hair and sat down beside her. “I’ll tell you whatever you want to know. I was talking about Shen Rou with him just now. He called me to plead on her behalf.

“He hopes that I can forgive her.”

“But you rejected him.” Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and asked, “Did Shen Rou do something that made you angry?”

“Mm.”

“What is it?”

“She did something bad to you.”

“To me?” Qiao Mianmian was shocked. “So, you’re angry because of me?”

“Mm.” Mo Yesi nodded.

“What did she do to me?” Qiao Mianmian was confused. “Why didn’t I know about it?”

“In your scandal with Su Ze, many netizens scolded you and defamed you on Weibo. Do you still remember this?” Mo Yesi combed her hair, enjoying the feeling of her soft hair brushing past his fingers.

Qiao Mianmian was stunned for a moment before her expression changed. “This has something to do with Shen Rou?”

Back then, there were a lot of haters.

Moreover, it was obvious that they were hired to defame her.

But she thought that Qiao Anxin was behind all that.

After all, Qiao Anxin and Su Ze hadn’t broken up.

If Qiao Anxin saw the scandal between her and Su Ze, she wouldn’t sit back and do nothing.

Mo Yesi nodded and said, “She hired those people.”

Qiao Mianmian had already guessed it, but she was still shocked when she heard the truth.

It was actually Shen Rou’s fake reviewers who defamed her.

She kept quiet for a while and guessed what was going on between Mo Yesi and Shen Rou.

Mo Yesi must have found out about this and laid his cards on the table with Shen Rou. The two of them... must have had a terrible argument.

“So, you’re unhappy with Shen Rou because of this?” Qiao Mianmian hesitated for a few seconds before asking, “Then, what do you plan to do?”

Shen Rou was his friend for over 20 years.

Even if it was a moment of unhappiness, it wouldn’t last long.

He would eventually... forgive Shen Rou.

After all, it wasn’t too serious to hire the Internet Water Army to defame her.

The scandal with Gong Zeli didn’t cause her any harm.

“Baby, you should be the one to answer this question.” Mo Yesi didn’t avoid her gaze and looked straight at her. “Everything she did hurt you, so you should be the one to decide how to handle this.”

Qiao Mianmian said, “You’ll do what I say?”

“Of course,” Mo Yesi replied without hesitation. “I’ll listen to you.”
