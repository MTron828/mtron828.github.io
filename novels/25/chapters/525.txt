Chapter 526: I’ll Massage You

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Mo Yesi was speechless.

His wife was guarded against him as if he was a thief.

Didn’t he do well in the last two times? Was she not satisfied with his performance?

Otherwise, why was she so averse to it?

But he took note of it. He knew that she was having a good time.

“Are your legs still aching?” Mo Yesi didn’t want to think about his other questions for now. He took off her shoes and rested her leg on his before rubbing her thighs.

He gently said, “I’ll massage you.”

Those hands that signed millions of yuan worth of documents were used to massage her now. He used just the right amount of force, not too much nor too little.

A few minutes later, Qiao Mianmian could already feel the ache minimizing by quite a lot. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Mo Yesi asked, “Am I using too much force?”

Qiao Mianmian looked down at his posture, bent over, and rubbed her legs. She felt a warm fuzzy feeling deep in her heart.

She smiled and said sweetly, “Nope, it’s good.”

“You feel better now?”

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian felt like ruffling his hair at the moment.

And, as it happened, she did. She reached out and touched his black, shiny hair.

The man froze for a moment.

Qiao Mianmian was shocked when she saw that.

“I’m sorry.” She hurriedly retracted her hand as she thought that he didn’t like it.

She knew that some men hated for others to touch their hair.

That was what they called “they’d rather drop their head than mess their hair”.

“I don’t mind it.” Mo Yesi took a few seconds to react, but he went on rubbing her legs as he smiled. “You can continue touching it.”

Qiao Mianmian felt her hand itch when he said he didn’t mind it.

Mo Yesi’s hair was pretty good. He could be in a shampoo commercial and wouldn’t need special effects of editing.

It felt nice to the touch.

If he really didn’t mind, she would want to feel it again...

Mo Yesi chuckled. “Every part of my body is open to your touch. You can touch it however you like and for however long you want.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Her cheeks burnt.

Why did she feel like there was a subtext to his words?

Was her mind too corrupted?

It sounded wrong.

But since he said he didn’t mind, she wasn’t going to hold back.

Qiao Mianmian reached out and ruffled his hair again. “Mo Yesi, have you massaged others before?”

He was using just the right amount of force.

It didn’t seem like his first time.

“Mm.” Mo Yesi looked so gentle and handsome as he said, “I used to massage Grandma’s legs back at home. Why? I’m good at it?”

Qiao Mianmian suddenly recalled.

She went to the Mo family once and knew that the Matriarch had some problems with her legs.

“Grandma’s legs...” Qiao Mianmian looked at him and hesitantly asked, “What happened to her? Will it be like that for the rest of her life?”
