Chapter 938: But There’s No Need for That in the Future

So what if they were from the Mo family.

They weren’t the two most powerful young masters in the Mo family.

If it was just a relative, it wasn’t too much.

He made it sound as if he could solve anything.

“Michael, get out.” Tu Yilei was furious. He pointed at the door. “I don’t need you here anymore. Get out now.”

“So be it.” Michael was also angry. He felt that his good intentions were being treated as ill intentions. He said angrily, “Little Tu Tu, I see that your mind isn’t clear yet, and you can’t tell who’s good and who’s bad. You think I’m an eyesore now, and I’ve embarrassed you, right? You don’t want to see me? Alright, I’ll leave. I won’t stay here anymore.

“I don’t want to bother with you anymore. You can do whatever you want. You won’t listen to me, anyway. You’ll only feel annoyed if I say too much. I really shouldn’t care so much. You don’t even care about what your life will be like in the future, why do I have to care?

“At the end of the day, even if you don’t become popular in the future, how big of a loss can it be for me? I can groom another artiste. If I can groom one you, I can groom another you.

“You’re just ruining your career.”

With that, Michael stormed out of the ward.

As he was still angry, he slammed the door shut on the way out.

Tu Yilei’s expression got worse.

He clenched his fist and stared at the closed door for a while before looking away coldly.

“I’m sorry, Miss Qiao, Mr. Mo.” His expression was awful. “My manager... was a little out of sorts because of me. He doesn’t have anything against you, he’s just unhappy with me.”

Mo Yesi smiled and didn’t seem to mind. “Mr. Tu, you’re overthinking it. I can understand your manager’s feelings, but I won’t mind it. Actually, Mr. Tu, you don’t have to mind it. People say things when they’re angry, you can’t take them seriously.”

Tu Yilei was stunned for a while before smiling. “Yes, you can’t take my words seriously. Mr. Mo, I know you’re really trying to make it up to me, but I’ve already said that I don’t need any compensation. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Miss Qiao doesn’t owe me anything, and neither does Mr. Mo. If Mr. Mo came to the hospital because of this, you don’t have to worry.”

“Miss Qiao.” Tu Yilei looked at Qiao Mianmian and smiled sadly. “You don’t have to come to the hospital to accompany me every day anymore. I was thinking of acting with you often, but it’s not necessary in the future.

“So, Miss Qiao doesn’t have to come to the hospital often.”

“Senior Tu, I...”

“Given my current situation, I won’t be able to film for the time being. I can’t possibly make the entire production crew wait for me to recover. The male lead of the production crew has to be changed, so there’s no need to rehearse in the future.”

Tu Yilei closed his eyes and looked tired. “In the past few years, my schedule has been full every day. I’ve never given myself a day off. It’s pretty tiring. I can take this opportunity to rest and do what I really want to do. There’s nothing bad about it.”
