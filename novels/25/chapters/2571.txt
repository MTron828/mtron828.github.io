Chapter 2572: Watch How You Address Her in the Future

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Su Su walked out from behind Gong Zeli and looked at Yan Shaoqing timidly.

Yan Shaoqing pursed his lips. “Mm.”

He was giving Gong Zeli face.

He really didn’t like this little girl called Su Su.

She looked timid, and his voice alone was enough to scare her.

It was as if he was a wolf.

Was this a joke?

Yan Shaoqing had good looks, a good figure, good family background, and was gentle and caring towards women.

When women saw him, they were only charmed and not afraid of him.

It was the first time in his life that he was guarded against like a monster. He was unhappy.

Moreover, Su Su was Qiao Mianmian’s substitute.

This made Yan Shaoqing even more uncomfortable.

What a joke. Who could replace a goddess like Sis-in-law?

Su Su looked a little similar, but she was nothing compared to Sis-in-law.

There was a difference in looks, temperament, and personality.

He really didn’t know what Fourth Bro was thinking. He thought that after talking to him for so long, he would have sent Su Su away long ago. He didn’t expect him to keep her by his side.

Su Su could tell that Yan Shaoqing didn’t like her, so she stood aside after greeting him.

She knew why Yan Shaoqing didn’t like her.

She knew that if she had a backbone, she should have left Gong Zeli.

But… she couldn’t.

She really liked Gong Zeli.

She liked him so much that she was willing to stay by his side even though she was just a substitute.

She even humbly thought that it was fortunate that she looked like the woman he liked, so she had the chance to be by his side.

“Does this little girl know how to play basketball? Bring her here.” Yan Shaoqing glanced at Su Su, who had her head lowered and her hands crossed in front of her. “If she doesn’t, won’t she be bored watching us play?”

“She doesn’t know. We can get someone to teach her.” Gong Zeli turned and walked towards the changing room. “She can wait for us at the rest area. If she’s really bored, she can go back anytime.”

Yan Shaoqing immediately caught up with him.

He shrugged. “Alright, you can arrange everything for your woman. I’m worrying for nothing.”

Su Su heard what Yan Shaoqing said.

The word “your woman” made her heart race.

She blushed and looked up at Gong Zeli.

Would he admit it?

Admit that she… was his woman.

Gong Zeli stopped in his tracks and turned to look at him.

Yan Shaoqing stopped in his tracks and raised an eyebrow. “What’s wrong?”

“Mm, you’re wrong,” Gong Zeli said expressionlessly. “She’s not my woman. Watch how you address her in the future.”

“Not your woman?” Yan Shaoqing raised his brows even higher. He glanced at Su Su, whose face had turned pale..
