Chapter 1860: I’m Pregnant

After arriving at the hospital, Jiang Luoli was immediately urged for a checkup.

Several doctors performed pregnancy tests on her.

Even though it was her first time doing a pregnancy test, she knew that this kind of treatment was probably something that ordinary people did not have.

Not long after, the results were out.

When the doctor came out with the report, Jiang Luoli rushed over and asked anxiously, “Doctor, am I pregnant?”

Seeing her anxious expression, the doctor glanced at Mo Shixiu standing at the side. He didn’t know if this was a good or a bad thing for him. Thus, he hesitated for a moment before saying, “According to the results of our examination, Miss Jiang, you’re indeed pregnant.”

As the doctor spoke, he thought to himself that this young girl might be able to achieve great things with the child in her womb.

After all, no one had ever seen a woman by Mo Shixiu’s side all these years.

If she was Mo Shixiu’s only woman and was pregnant with his child, her future would definitely be limitless.

After the doctor finished speaking, he checked Mo Shixiu’s reaction.

The man didn’t seem to have any expression on his face.

He didn’t look happy, but he wasn’t unhappy either.

The doctor couldn’t tell what he was thinking.

“I’m really pregnant?” Jiang Luoli widened her eyes in shock.

Even though she was mentally prepared, she still couldn’t react in time after this matter was confirmed.

She was... really pregnant?

“Yes, Miss Jiang.” The doctor smiled. “The fetus is very healthy. Congratulations, Miss Jiang. Congratulations, Mr. Mo.”

“Mo Shixiu.” Jiang Luoli was stunned for a while. She turned around and looked at Mo Shixiu with confusion in her eyes. She muttered in a low voice, “I’m pregnant.”

Mo Shixiu stepped forward and held her hand. “Yes, you’re going to be a mother. I’m going to be a father.”

“But, but...” Jiang Luoli’s mind was in a mess. ” But, why am I pregnant?”

“How can the pregnancy be fake?” Mo Shixiu chuckled and reached out to rub her head. He said dotingly, “Luoli, you’re pregnant with our baby. I will take good care of you and our son.”

The doctor at the side listened to their conversation and confirmed Mo Shixiu’s attitude.

It seemed like he was going to keep the child.

This girl called Jiang Luoli was really going to ascend to heaven in one step.

It didn’t matter if she could marry Mo Shixiu.

As long as she gave birth to this child, the things Mo Shixiu gave her would be enough for her to live in luxury for the rest of her life.

...

Jiang Luoli was still in a daze when they left the hospital.

A thought kept replaying in her mind: I’m pregnant. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

She was really pregnant.

She had read the report several times.

Not a single word was missed.

Guessing that she might be pregnant was different from getting confirmation.

She held the report in her hand and couldn’t help but read it carefully again.

A low chuckle came from beside him. “You’ve already read it several times. Is there a problem with this report?”

Jiang Luoli turned around and looked into the man’s dark, smiling eyes. “Mo Shixiu, do you think... the test might be wrong?”

“That’s impossible.”
