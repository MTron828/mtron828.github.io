Chapter 2022: Why Are You Looking for Mo Yesi?

He was Mo Yesi’s special assistant, so he had to be there during the meeting.

Qiao Mianmian smiled and found a seat. “Go to the meeting, don’t bother about me. It’s not my first time here, I don’t need anyone to accompany me. Go out and tell the secretary that I want a cappuccino.”

“Alright, I’ll let the secretary know.”

Wei Zheng left.

Qiao Mianmian took off her shoes and sat cross-legged on the sofa. She then took out her cell phone and opened the script she had downloaded on a reading app.

She was focused on the script when she heard a knock on the door. She thought that the secretary had brought the cappuccino and said: “Come in”.

The office door was pushed open.

The secretary walked in.

A strong smell of perfume followed.

Qiao Mianmian frowned and looked up.

She found it strange.

Mo Yesi had a request for his female secretary.

She wasn’t allowed to use perfume.

Qiao Mianmian had been here many times before, but she hadn’t smelled any perfume on the secretary.

She looked up and saw a woman walking in.

The woman was dressed in a professional blue suit and pants. Her legs were slender, and she was wearing high heels, sporting a good figure.

She was about 1.7 meters tall and looked capable.

She looked like a career woman.

She was holding a briefcase in one hand. When she entered the office and saw Qiao Mianmian sitting cross-legged on the sofa, the woman was obviously stunned.

It took her a few seconds to react. She then looked at Qiao Mianmian’s sitting posture and frowned. “Where’s Chairman Mo? Who are you? Why are you in Chairman Mo’s office?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She should be the one asking.

Who was this woman?

Why was she in Mo Yesi’s office?

Qiao Mianmian blinked. “And who are you? Why are you looking for Mo Yesi?”

The woman frowned even more.

She felt that she was being unruly.

The woman kept quiet for a few seconds and then said unhappily, “I’m here to discuss business with Chairman Mo. I have something to discuss with him. As for what, I’m sorry, it’s not convenient to tell outsiders.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Her intuition told her that this woman seemed to be hostile towards her.

Qiao Mianmian had no idea where this hostility came from.

“Oh, I see.” Qiao Mianmian nodded and smiled at the woman. “Mo Yesi is still in a meeting, it’ll be over soon. Do you want to wait for him? Don’t stand on ceremony, find a seat for yourself.”

Qiao Mianmian’s casual and intimate words seemed to antagonize the woman even more.

The woman’s expression stiffened, and she looked at her sharply. “Who are you?”

“Me?”

Qiao Mianmian smiled and didn’t reveal her identity. “I’m here to discuss business with him, too. I knew he was in a meeting, so I’m waiting for him in his office.”

The woman couldn’t help but feel a little hostile.

Looking at how casual she was and how affectionate she sounded, especially when she called Mo Yesi by his name…
