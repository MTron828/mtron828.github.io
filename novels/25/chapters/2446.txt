Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Qiao Mianmian, it’s you.” Shen Rou had only seen Qiao Mianmian’s back, so she didn’t recognize her before.

Qiao Mianmian turned around. Although she was wearing a mask, Shen Rou could still recognize her voice.

Shen Rou’s expression darkened.

She pursed her lips and glared at her.

“Miss Shen, what a coincidence.” Qiao Mianmian took off her mask and smiled at Shen Rou.

The employee felt the name was familiar when Shen Rou called Qiao Mianmian’s name.

When Qiao Mianmian took off her mask, the employee finally recognized her.

Qiao Mianmian’s “If You Can’t Love” shot her to fame, and the employee had seen it before.

After knowing Qiao Mianmian’s identity, the employee quickly guessed Mo Yesi’s identity.

So, the big customer who seemed to have an extraordinary status was Chairman Mo?

The boss of this mall?!

The employee was shocked, but then she felt that this was normal.

If it wasn’t Mo Yesi, which man could have such looks and temperament?

She’d already guessed that Mo Yesi’s status was very high, but she didn’t expect it to be this high.

Then, the employee recalled the gossip on Weibo and looked at Qiao Mianmian and Shen Rou meaningfully.

The two people standing in front of her.

One was Mo Yesi’s childhood sweetheart who had liked him for many years.

The other was Mo Yesi’s current fiancée, and they were about to get married.

Shen Rou must be very upset to see Qiao Mianmian.

The love rival was furious.

Would they… fight?

Just as the employee was worried about this, Shen Rou sneered and said coldly, “I was wondering who it was, wearing a mask and acting like a big star. So it’s you.”

“Yes, it’s me.” Qiao Mianmian smiled again and said slowly, “Miss Shen is right. A big star like me has to wear a mask when going out. After all, I have a lot of fans. I’m different from Miss Shen, who won’t be chased around for autographs and photos.

“Of course, Miss Shen might not be able to experience this. It’s normal that you don’t understand.”

Shen Rou didn’t expect Qiao Mianmian to be so shameless.

She really admitted that she was a big star.

She had never seen someone so thick-skinned.

She was originally mocking Qiao Mianmian, but after being mocked in return, her expression darkened.

“Of course, I’m different from you.” Shen Rou quickly thought of a counterattack. Her lips curled into a disdainful smile as she said calmly, “So what if celebrities have a lot of fans? They might sound like a big deal, but they’re just actors in upper-class society.

“Only ordinary people take celebrities seriously and chase you every day to satisfy your vanity, making you feel like you’re impressive. But an actress is still just an actress. It’s a profession that has been looked down upon since ancient times. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“I don’t want that experience.

“After all, I don’t want to be a lowly actress.”
