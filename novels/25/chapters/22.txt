Chapter 23: Sister, What Are You Doing Here?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Anxin was indeed very pretty. Moreover, she was a popular celebrity, everyone would be proud to take her out and about.

The Qiao family wasn’t doing well anymore.

But Qiao Anxin herself was doing great in the entertainment circle. When she became a first-tier artiste, his family wouldn’t have anything to object her for.

“Then let’s get it.” Su Ze saw the envious looks of the employees and decided to ride on it. “Look around for a bit more. If you see more pieces that catch your eye, we can settle the tab altogether later.”

“Wah.” Qiao Anxin was very happy to hear that. She tiptoed and gave him a peck on the lips. “Brother Ze, you’re so good to me!”

The employees attending to them looked at her in envy.

Qiao Anxin really was a winner in life.

Not only was she born with natural beauty, but she was also doing well in her career, and even got herself a generous boyfriend who treated her so well!

The dress cost a few tens of thousands in yuan, and he agreed to get it for her just like that.

Tsk tsk, why weren’t they lucky enough to meet a handsome and rich man like him?

Qiao Anxin continued looking around on her own to pick out more clothes.

Meanwhile, Su Ze was led to a rest area to wait.

But the moment he turned around, he caught sight of a familiar figure.

“Mianmian?” He seemed a bit stunned.

And then he knitted his brows. “What are you doing here?”

He looked as though this was an inappropriate place for Qiao Mianmian to be at.

Qiao Anxin heard something going on and immediately turned around.

She was taken aback to see Qiao Mianmian and naturally turned to see how Su Ze reacted.

Seeing the way Su Ze kept his eyes on Qiao Mianmian without even blinking, her expression darkened.

Qiao Mianmian was in a white t-shirt, pale blue three-quarter pants and a pair of white shoes.

Her lush black hair was let down casually and she had on very light makeup, making her appear clean-cut and refreshing.

Although she was simply dressed, her exquisite look was still rather eye-catching.

Qiao Anxin’s jealousy thickened.

This shameless Qiao Mianmian, was she out to seduce Su Ze?

“Sister, what are you doing here?” Qiao Anxin stood in front of Su Ze as if to shield him and eyed her as if she was a dangerous enemy.

Qiao Mianmian found her actions ridiculous, even funny.

It seemed like every third party who became the “main girl” would forget that they were the thieves.

Qiao Anxin was the same.

Seeing this annoying couple before her, she didn’t even feel like talking.

She swept her glance past the two of them expressionlessly and turned to leave. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Sister!”

Qiao Anxin called out to her and asked her out of feigned curiosity, “Since you’re here to get clothes, why are you leaving without buying anything?”

Before Qiao Mianmian could reply, she continued her pretense and acted as if she’d just come to a realization. “Oh, I remember now. There aren’t many performance openings recently for you to earn your income as a walk-on actor. And Brother Qiao Chen is still seeking treatment in the hospital and you’ve got to pay for his expenses.”

Hearing that Qiao Mianmian was just a walk-on actor, the employees started eyeing her with disdain.

No wonder she was dressed so simply.

She was just a poor girl.

And as they heard Qiao Anxin call her “Sister”, they despised her even more.
