Chapter 58: I Will Not Let Anyone Hurt You

After speaking, she slowly walked out of the bedroom, leaving behind a confused Jiang Luoli.

Qiao Mianmian stood in the corridor outside and called Mo Yesi.

After only a few beeps, he picked up.

“You just left me and you already miss me?”

The man’s magnetically humorous voice sounded as if carrying a radio wave, making Qiao Mianmian’s heart tremble.

She blushed at his openness and flirtatiousness.

“Is there something wrong?” Fortunately, Mo Yesi didn’t continue to tease her. The man’s pleasant and soft voice rang in her ears. “Are you in trouble again, do you need my help?”

“Um...” Qiao Mianmian was embarrassed to hear him say so.

She had only troubled him yesterday, and today again...

She felt like she was particularly troublesome.

As if guessing what she was thinking now, Mo Yesi went on to say, “Just tell me anything directly and don’t feel embarrassed. Qiao Mianmian, I am your husband, you can let me do anything for you.”

Every word spoken by the man was like a pair of warm hands, stroking Qiao Mianmian’s heart gently.

Her heart was warm.

After hearing his words, she didn’t hesitate and said directly, “Yes, I need your help. Can you call a few bodyguards to come for me? About four or five of them.”

“What happened?” Mo Yesi’s tone suddenly became serious.

It was also much colder.

Qiao Mianmian thought that the two were now married, and in a sense, Mo Yesi was also her relative.

So she didn’t hide from him.

She told him the contradiction between her and Shen Yueyue. In the end, she concluded. “In short, she felt like I’ve snatched her man, so she has always hated me. Now, she thinks that I have nobody to rely on, so she wants to take revenge on me.”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t realize that when she said these words to Mo Yesi, her tone was aggrieved as if she was complaining to him.

After a moment of silence, Mo Yesi said, “Didn’t you tell her that your husband is more powerful than Su Ze by a hundred times? That she wouldn’t be able to have a good life if she has offended you?”

Qiao Mianmian went quiet.

She hadn’t had time to think about it then.

At first, she didn’t want too many people to know that she was married.

She was only nineteen. It wasn’t in her life plan to get married so early.

She always felt that it would be an embarrassment to let others know that she had married so early.

Her ideal age for marriage was twenty-eight.

Besides, even if she really talked to Shen Yueyue like this, she would certainly not believe it.

She would assume she was bragging.

“Rest assured, I’m here. No one can hurt you at all.” A few seconds later, the man said in a low and gentle voice, “Mianmian, I won’t let anyone hurt you.”

The gentle, low voice of the man fell into her ears as if there was a string stroking Qiao Mianmian’s heart. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Her heart couldn’t calm down for a moment.

At this point, Qiao Mianmian felt like it was really good to have someone to rely on.

She seemed to have found a shelter, where she no longer had to worry about the wind and rain.

In her heart, she felt an unprecedented sense of tranquility and stability.

After hanging up, Qiao Mianmian put away her phone and walked towards the bedroom.

She had to tidy up the things that Shen Yueyue had thrown onto the ground.
