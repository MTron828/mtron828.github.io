Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

That Jiang girl was definitely introduced to Mo Shixiu by Qiao Mianmian.

Madam Mo was furious at this thought.

Qiao Mianmian, that vixen, not only harmed her son but also caused her best friend to harm her other son.

So what if she was the daughter of the Bai family? If she stayed by her son’s side, she might do something in the future.

She couldn’t let her son be harmed by that woman. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Whether it was Qiao Mianmian or Jiang Luoli, these scheming women couldn’t stay by her two sons’ side.

...

City F.

After filming a scene, Qiao Mianmian was about to return to the van to rest when Qin Han stopped her.

“Mianmian, hold on.”

Qiao Mianmian stopped in her tracks and turned to look at him. She took a piece of paper from Nana and wiped the sweat off her forehead. “Brother Han, what’s the matter?”

“Mm.” Qin Han nodded and walked to her. “Do you remember the audition I mentioned to you last time? The casting starts tomorrow. I asked Director Bai just now. We don’t have any scenes tomorrow. I can take you to the audition.”

Qiao Mianmian recalled.

Qin Han had told her about an audition for a huge production.

“Alright. Thank you, Brother Han.” Qiao Mianmian was very grateful that Qin Han not only helped her get an audition but also took her there personally.

She felt that Qin Han was a very good senior.

He would usually teach her a lot about acting.

Qin Han played a part in Qiao Mianmian’s performance.

To her, Qin Han was a good senior and mentor. He was willing to groom newbies.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t know that Qin Han wasn’t the kind of person she thought he was.

He was willing to help her because he admired her.

And she was the only junior Qin Han admired.

“Brother Han, do I need to prepare anything in advance?” Qiao Mianmian knew that the audition Qin Han introduced to her was an excellent resource and valued tomorrow’s interview.

Although she felt that the chances of her audition were slim.

But no matter how unlikely it was, she still had hope.

No matter what, she would do her best.

As for the outcome, she couldn’t control it.

Qin Han smiled. “You don’t have to make any special preparations. Just maintain your current state. Go back and have a good sleep tonight. You can go for the audition with the best appearance.”

Qiao Mianmian nodded. “Alright.”

Qin Han added, “There are a lot of A- and B-list actors going for the audition this time. Don’t be afraid when the time comes. You’re not as famous as them, but the director and producers pick the roles. Your acting skills are the most important.

“As long as you can beat them in acting, you have a chance of being chosen.”

“I got it, Brother Han. I’ll do my best.”

“Mm, don’t be too stressed. It’s naturally best if you can be chosen. If not, take it as an experience. You’re still young, there are many opportunities in the future.”

Qin Han said a few more words and then left.

“Coming, coming, coming again.” The crew’s logistics team arrived punctually with a few boxes of afternoon tea. Everyone habitually walked over and took their afternoon tea.
