Chapter 855: Do You Have Yogurt?

When she was with Bai Yusheng, they felt like siblings.

She even thought that it would be great if he was her brother.

...

The shoot went smoothly.

Qiao Mianmian was doing better than she thought.

Many scenes were shot at once.

Tu Yilei’s acting was very good, so he was especially good at leading the actors.

When Qiao Mianmian was acting with him, it was easy for him to quickly immerse her in the plot. One of them had good acting skills, while the other had a high level of understanding. They worked well together.

The person most satisfied was Bai Yusheng.

Back when he picked Qiao Mianmian as the female lead, he wasn’t sure if she was really suitable.

He was a little selfish.

He felt that this girl was very likable. Hence, he thought of her first when the slot for the female lead opened.

There was someone more suitable than Qiao Mianmian.

But after much consideration, he decided to give her the chance.

Qiao Mianmian’s performance didn’t disappoint him at all.

It even made him feel pleasantly surprised.

She was exactly the type of female lead he wanted.

Huang Yilin’s performance back then was already good enough.

But as a newcomer, Qiao Mianmian was actually slightly better than her.

As both the male and female leads performed well, the filming process went unexpectedly smoothly. Hence, the original scene that was supposed to be completed at 8 pm was completed three hours earlier.

Bai Yusheng was in a good mood. With a wave of his hand, he invited the crew to have dinner together.

As the male and female lead of the crew, Qiao Mianmian and Tu Yilei both agreed to the gathering.

...

The gathering was at a five-star hotel.

Bai Yusheng was rich and generous. Despite each table costing tens of thousands, he invited several tables worth of people.

After dinner, he booked the best entertainment venue in City F.

As the female lead, Qiao Mianmian naturally couldn’t be absent. After the meal, she took Bai Yusheng’s car and followed along.

Bai Yusheng booked a few private rooms.

Qiao Mianmian, Tu Yilei, and some of the main crew members had a private room.

Other groups of people were in the remaining private rooms.

Men always had to drink at parties.

Some female artistes had to drink with them.

Qiao Mianmian was the only special one among them.

Bai Yusheng said in front of everyone that no one was allowed to toast her, and she couldn’t drink it.

He then asked her what she wanted to drink.

Qiao Mianmian blushed and kept quiet for a while before asking softly, “Do you have yogurt?” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

She felt like she’d asked something she shouldn’t have.

This was an entertainment venue.

How could there be yogurt?

Then, she immediately corrected herself. “Milk is fine too. If there isn’t any, I can drink plain water.”

Bai Yusheng nodded and called for a waiter. “Do you have yogurt here?”

The waiter was stunned for a while before replying respectfully, “Mr. Bai, we don’t have yogurt here.”

“But this girl wants to drink yogurt. What do you think we should do?”

Bai Yusheng was sitting on the black sofa with his legs crossed. He looked very lazy and relaxed when he wasn’t working. The way he reached out to unbutton his shirt made him look like a playboy.
