Chapter 87: What Sort of Sleeping Posture Was This!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian finally understood what he meant.

When Mo Yesi said “sleep with him”, he meant it in the simplest and purest manner.

She actually thought dirty?!

She shocked herself with those thoughts of hers.

Ahhh, she was still thinking about how shameless he was and how disrespectful he was being.

But it was all because of her corrupted thoughts!

From the kiss to sleeping together... it had all been her wishful thinking.

When did she start becoming this way?

Thankfully, Mo Yesi had fallen asleep and had no idea about this. Otherwise, she would be too embarrassed to face him.

Qiao Mianmian felt her cheeks burning up again.

She didn’t have to look at them to know they were red.

That man had his body against her, and she felt extremely small and petite against him. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Her face was just beneath his chin, and moving even a little bit would cause her to touch his Adam’s apple.

She could feel his charm with each breath he took.

His warm breath against her neck tickled her.

The room was so quiet and peaceful, his breathing was audible.

Sunlight poured in from the windows and the occasional bird chirping could be heard from the courtyard.

“Mo Yesi?” Qiao Mianmian called him softly, not believing that he could have just fallen asleep like this.

This was way too fast.

He laid against her for less than two minutes and already fell asleep?

Didn’t he say that he wouldn’t feel sleepy even if he had a bad sleep?

The man did not respond nor move.

“Mo Yesi? Are you really sleeping?” Qiao Mianmian called out again quietly. She felt as if his weight could flatten her.

His muscles’ weight was not to be reckoned with.

The man still showed no response.

He had evidently fallen asleep.

And it was a deep sleep too.

Qiao Mianmian was caught in an awkward position.

What sort of sleeping posture was this!

Who would sleep like that?

He was so big and heavy and he had just lain against her like this?

She was going to be suffocated!!

Qiao Mianmian was thinking of kicking him aside, but as she recalled his words previously, she couldn’t bear to do it.

Forget it, it was hard for him to get a chance to sleep so soundly. She would just... tolerate it.

Qiao Mianmian unknowingly fell asleep too over the next few minutes.

When she woke up, she was already in the car.

Mo Yesi’s suit was draped over her, while the man was driving beside her.

She opened her eyes and heard him ask, “You’re up? Did you sleep well?”

Qiao Mianmian rubbed her eyes. “I fell asleep too?”

She had no idea when she fell asleep or when he moved her to the car.

She was supposed to be accompanying him as he slept.

But she ended up being the one sleeping like a log.

Mo Yesi smiled. “You’ve got to ask yourself that. You were already sleeping when I woke up. A deep sleep, actually. I called you twice, but you didn’t get up, so I had no choice but to carry you to the car.”
