Chapter 784: Do You Think He’s a True Man?

After replying, the sweet voice of the air stewardess could be heard on the radio, reminding the passengers that the plane was about to take off and that all their electronic devices were turned off.

Qiao Mianmian turned off her cell phone and prepared to take a nap.

Just as she closed her eyes, she heard a surprised voice. “Qiao Mianmian?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She opened her eyes and saw Gong Zeli looking at her in shock.

She was shocked too.

She never expected to meet Gong Zeli here.

She’d decided to fly back to Yuncheng City today.

“It’s really you.” Gong Zeli’s heart skipped a beat when he saw her eyes.

He looked away unnaturally and walked past her.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

No way. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Gong Zeli was sitting beside her?

This was too much of a coincidence.

Then, she saw Gong Zeli really walk over to sit beside her.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

After he sat down, he turned to look at her. He hesitated for a while before saying, “Aren’t you filming? Why are you on this flight? You’re not filming anymore?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Although her impression of Gong Zeli wasn’t that bad now, and she felt that he wasn’t that detestable anymore.

But Gong Zeli still felt like a stranger to her.

She couldn’t forget all the unhappiness from their first meeting.

And the few times he targeted her...

She didn’t like this man at all.

Hence, when Gong Zeli spoke to her, she didn’t really want to talk to him.

But thinking about how he helped her clear her name on Weibo previously, she hesitated for a while before replying, “I don’t have a shot today, so I’m on vacation.”

“I see.” Gong Zeli nodded and turned around.

Qiao Mianmian heaved a sigh of relief when she realized that he wasn’t going to continue chatting with her.

She really didn’t want to continue chatting with him.

It seemed like they weren’t close enough to chat.

She turned around and took out the eye mask from her bag. Just as she was about to put it on, the man beside her said, “Your ex-fiancé... is still harassing you? The one I saw on the streets.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She didn’t want to bother about it.

But Gong Zeli continued, “A good man doesn’t like to be turned back. That man doesn’t look reliable at all. Don’t be fooled by his sweet words. I even saw him having a meal with a woman yesterday. They looked really intimate.

“He’s dating another woman while trying to get back together with you. Do you think he’s a true man?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Su Ze was on a date with another woman?

Alright, even though she already knew that Su Ze wasn’t a good person, she didn’t feel anything but disgust towards him.

But at this moment, she was even more disgusted by the jerk.

He even begged her to get back together with him on the streets that day.

And he went on a date with another woman so soon?

Every time she realized how much of a jerk Su Ze was, she would seriously doubt her judgment.

After all, she used to think that Su Ze was a reliable and honest man.
