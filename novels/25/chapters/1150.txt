Chapter 1152: Why Haven’t You Posted on Weibo?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

If they wanted to sue you, no one could escape unscathed.

There had never been a case where Mo Corporation lost in the past.

As long as the gold medal lawyers moved out, they would definitely win.

However, because this gold medal legal team was specially set up for the CEO of the Mo Corporation, they couldn’t be involved in any trivial lawsuits. Therefore, when the Mo Corporation’s official Weibo account said that they would assist Nameless in the lawsuit, the netizens were especially surprised.

He even managed to invite the Mo Corporation’s top lawyers...

Some netizens had guessed Nameless’s true identity, but because of the Mo Family’s Second Young Master’s well-known “misogyny”, the netizens who had already guessed Mo Yesi’s identity felt that it was unlikely to be him.

After some netizens rejected him, they guessed that it might be Mo Shixiu.

Those who guessed Mo Shixiu felt that it was even more impossible.

Mo Shixiu was busy with work for 365 days a year. His figure could be seen on various current affairs news every day.

He had no time to fall in love.

In short, after this nameless person appeared, the direction of Weibo changed instantly.

The rumors about her and Gong Zeli were automatically cleared up.

No one said anything about Gong Zeli being her sugar daddy anymore.

Those who said that she had an abortion in high school and had a rotten private life had their Weibo accounts erased.

Not long after, the Mo Corporation’s official Weibo lawyer sent out a letter.

The people whose accounts had been erased were all on the legal list of charges. The Mo Corporation had also claimed that they had received detailed information about everyone on Weibo and would immediately launch a lawsuit against them.

In other words, it was useless for those haters to delete all their posts.

As long as it was registered, traces would be left behind.

Once the Weibo technical department checked, they would be able to find out the registration information.

Since the Mo Corporation had already sent a lawyer’s letter, everyone could tell the severity of the situation.

Usually, when they encountered such a situation, they would kill the chicken for the monkey to see.

The first ones to be sued were the accounts that were the first to instigate and forwarded a lot.

After these people were sued, the other people who had been slandering Qiao Mianmian all deleted the relevant Weibo posts, afraid that they would be included in the list.

The originally foul Weibo instantly quieted down.

All of Qiao Mianmian’s negative searches had disappeared.

Only her contract as MC’s spokesperson and the two hot searches that were suspected to be Little Xiao’s alternate account complaining about their endorsement being stolen were still around.

The others stopped. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

But Little Xiao’s fans had not stopped yet.

They were still complaining that Qiao Mianmian had snatched Xiaoxiao’s endorsement through the back door.

The fans felt indignant for Xiaoxiao, saying that Qiao Mianmian was “bullying people”.

...

On the other side.

At Xinghan Entertainment.

When President Zhang saw that Little Xiao’s hot search was still on Weibo, he was so angry that he threw his phone on the desk. “Didn’t I tell you to make a statement right away to clarify that Qiao Mianmian’s endorsement wasn’t snatched from you?

“Why haven’t you posted on Weibo yet?”

Little Xiao stood aggrievedly in front of the desk. “But President Zhang, that endorsement should have been mine. If that woman called Qiao Mianmian hadn’t taken the endorsement through the back door, I would have been MC’s spokesperson for the next season.

“What right does she have to snatch my endorsement? MC has signed her as the spokesperson. Will she be able to sell anything in the future?”
