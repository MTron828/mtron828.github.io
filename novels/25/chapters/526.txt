Chapter 528: You Need to Train Yourself Up

On the surface, this man was as cold as a person could get.

He practically had the word “unapproachable” written on his face.

He was only this much of a hooligan before her.

And he was only this cheeky before her as well.

If she told others that Mo Yesi was actually a perverted hooligan deep down, likely no one would believe it.

“Serious?” Mo Yesi chuckled. “I’m very serious usually. But once I see you, I just can’t get serious. What do I do?”

There was no response.

“Baby, you want me to be more serious. But that’s only possible under one circumstance.”

“What circumstance?” Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but ask, even though she knew that she might not like the answer.

Mo Yesi smiled and picked her up. He sat on the couch and rested her body against his.

Qiao Mianmian was just like a child, sitting on his lap and subjected to his affectionate moves.

The man kissed her and said hoarsely, “When I have enough of it one day, I’ll show you how serious I can get.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Did he... not have enough today?

Mo Yesi pecked her on the lips twice more and seemed to read her mind. “You think your hubby is satisfied with just two rounds? I’m letting you off today because I know you’re unwell.

“If I’m really to have enough of it... I doubt your petite figure will be able to take it. Baby, you need to train yourself up. Otherwise, how are you going to take me in the future?”

Jiang Luoli was right.

Her body constitution was a little weak and couldn’t bear too much.

Just once or twice already got her begging for mercy.

She lacked the training for this.

He’d have to exercise more with her in the future. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qiao Mianmian blushed.

Was this man never tired?

He had such good stamina.

She was aching so badly all over, but he seemed completely fine.

He was still so energetic.

He could even... tease her!

“Mo Yesi, don’t you even think about it!” Qiao Mianmian glared at him, red-faced. “You’re not touching me for the next few days.”

She was afraid.

This man was like a wild beast with no self-control at all sometimes.

He looked like he would want to swallow her whole.

He kept telling her he wanted her.

And her ears went red as she listened to him go on.

The current Mo Yesi was different from the Mo Yesi she knew usually.

It was like a whole different person.

In any case, she really was afraid of him after having a first-hand experience of it.

“Alright, I won’t touch you.” Mo Yesi reached out and ruffled her hair.

He was going to agree to anything she said now.

Whether or not he really could do it was another matter.

In his job, he was always a reliable and trustworthy person.

He did whatever he said he would.

But to his own woman...

He didn’t have to be so hard on himself.
