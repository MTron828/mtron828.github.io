Chapter 613: I Want to Investigate Something That Happened 10 Years Ago

Young Master had high standards. In fact, the only woman he’d ever taken seriously was probably Young Lady Shen.

Young Lady Shen was indeed compatible with him in terms of her educational level, looks, family background, and more.

The only issue was that Young Lady Shen wasn’t fond of the Young Master.

Sigh. Who would Young Master’s other half be? What kind of woman would she be like?

After the housemaid left, Gong Zeli swirled the ice in his glass and recalled the call just now. He narrowed his eyes and then made another call.

The other party picked up. “Young Master Gong.”

“Help me check something out.”

Gong Zeli placed his glass on the table and tapped his fingers on the surface. After thinking through it, he said calmly, “I want to investigate something that happened 10 years ago.”

...

Qiao Mianmian’s news was taken down very quickly.

Mo Yesi had activated the Public Relations Department of the Mo Corporation, and in less than half an hour, the verified accounts had taken down their reposts, the “hot search” topic got removed and, soon after, many users’ accounts were deactivated. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

It was such huge news, but it vanished almost without a trace.

It was so quick that some netizens hadn’t even found out what really happened.

It was as if none of it took place.

Even the “related topics” were shut down.

A few netizens found that as long as they typed the words “Qiao Mianmian” or “Mistress Qiao Mianmian,” their posts couldn’t be sent at all.

Hence, they could only use other symbols in order to make their point.

You Lack A Girlfriend: Damn, who else is in the same situation as me. I can’t post anything on Weibo once the words “q1a0m1anm1an” is in it. Did Young Master Su do this? That’s so cool.

Your Smile Is Pretty: Me too. I typed her name just now and couldn’t send the post at all. I thought it was my internet connection at first, but it seems like everyone is facing the same problem. And I saw that the Qiao and Su searches have been taken down. The verified accounts took them down too. Is that Su guy that awesome? How does he do this, won’t it cost a lot?

You Are Actually Ugly: I don’t think money is enough for this to happen. Maybe spending a sum would get them to take the “hot searches” down, but it can’t possibly be enough to get the huge verified accounts to remove their posts too. I doubt the Su Mandate is powerful enough for that. Unless... that Qiao girl has another backing? Could it be Young Master Gong chipping in?

Little Cutie: This Qiao-Mian woman is too powerful. Not only did Young Master Gong help her clarify the situation, he even helped to take all the news down? Gosh, when has Young Master Gong been so attentive and thoughtful to a woman? Is she really his girlfriend? Honestly, she does look pretty, like a little goddess that all men would want to dote on. It wouldn’t be surprising if Young Master Gong really liked her.

A Lemon: She does look pretty good, but I wouldn’t call her a goddess. She has makeup on. If she really is so good-looking, she should take a selfie, bare-faced. If a bare-faced selfie can look good, then she really is good-looking.

A netizen actually went to dig out Qiao Mianmian’s recent album and really found an unedited, bare-faced photograph of her.
