“Mon, it’s not like I’m tasting your food for the first time. There’s nothing bad about your dishes.” Qiao Mianmian turned to look at her future sister-in-law.

The smile on her face froze when she saw the woman beside Mother Bai.

Even her expression froze.

Her eyes widened in shock.

How could it be her! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Miss Qiao, I trust you have been well since we last met.” Tang Ya smiled as she looked at Qiao Mianmian in disbelief. “Long time no see. Miss Qiao, you’re getting prettier.”

“Eh, Xiao Ya, you know Mianmian?” Mother Bai was shocked.

“Yes, Aunt. I’ve met Miss Qiao a few times before.” Tang Ya turned around and said gently to Mother Bai, “But we’ve only met a few times, so we’re not very familiar with each other.”

“I see.” Mother Bai didn’t feel that the atmosphere was different. Instead, she said happily, “Since you know each other, then I don’t have to introduce you again. Xiao Ya, you’re dating Yusheng, and Mianmian is Yusheng’s sister. Don’t call her Miss Qiao anymore. It’s so distant.

“Call her Mianmian, just like us.”

‘Tang Ya pursed her lips and said obediently, “Alright.”

Qiao Mianmian was still in a daze.

She was too shocked.

No matter how she thought about it, she couldn’t believe that Bai Yusheng’s girlfriend was Tang Ya.

How could his girlfriend be Tang Ya?

It wasn’t because Tang Ya had targeted the Mo Corporation previously that Qiao Mianmian felt that Bai Yusheng shouldn’t have looked for her, but Tang Ya was a problem!

‘They hadn’t found out who she was yet.

She didn’t know why Tang Ya came to Yuncheng City.

What if she wasn’t here just to deal with the Mo Corporation?

She was on good terms with Madam Mo, and now she was Bai Yusheng’s girlfriend.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but suspect that she had ulterior motives.

“Mianmian, what’s wrong? Are you feeling unwell?” Mother Bai finally noticed her abnormality and asked with concern.

“No, I’m alright.” Qiao Mianmian shook her head and concealed her surprise and worry. She pursed her lips and smiled as if nothing had happened. “I just feel that the world is too small. I didn’t expect Brother’s girlfriend… to be someone I’ve met before.”

“So, this is fate.” Mother Bai didn’t know what Tang Ya had done before. She was very satisfied with her. She held Tang Ya’s hand and said smilingly, “This means that Xiao Ya and Yusheng are fated.”

Qiao Mianmian came out of the kitchen with a serious expression.

She walked straight to Bai Yusheng. “Brother, I have something to talk to you about alone. Come over.”

With that, she turned and walked upstairs.

Bai Yusheng slowly stood up.

In the study upstairs.

Qiao Mianmian had just entered the study when Bai Yusheng followed behind.

The door closed.

Bai Yusheng smiled and walked towards her. “Mianmian, what do you want to tell me? You’re being so secretive.”

“What’s with that Tang Ya?” Qiao Mianmian didn’t beat around the bush and asked directly. “Don’t you know that she and the Shen family worked together to deal with the Mo Corporation? Her identity is very suspicious, she’s definitely not a simple person.

“She came to Yuncheng City with a motive.”
