Chapter 3017 A Young Master

Not long after, Qiao Chen arrived.

“Brother-in-law, how’s my sister now?” He quickly walked up to Mo Yesi and looked at the tightly shut door of the delivery room.

He was the same as Mo Yesi. Although he knew that it wouldn’t be dangerous, the person giving birth was his sister. He couldn’t possibly not be worried.

“She’s still in the delivery room.” Mo Yesi looked at the closed doors and frowned. He turned to Lu Rao and asked, “Didn’t you say it was soon? Why isn’t Mianmian out yet?”

Lu Rao was speechless. He could only predict the time, he couldn’t decide when the baby was going to be born. “Brother-in-law, let’s wait for a while more.” Qiao Chen comforted him. “Sister should be out soon.” Mo Yesi pursed his lips and kept staring at the door of the delivery room.

After a while, Qiao Ruhai received the call.

Mother Bai and Father Bai were rather polite to Qiao Ruhai. Upon seeing him, Mother Bai called out, “In-law, you’re here. Mianmian is still in the delivery room. Come and sit down.”

Old Madam opened her eyes and glanced at him. She didn’t say anything and closed her eyes again to continue chanting.

Because Qiao Ruhai was biased towards Qiao Anxin, Qiao Mianmian suffered a lot. Old Madam was also a very protective person and didn’t like Qiao Ruhai, so she naturally wouldn’t be nice to him.

Mother Bai and Father Bai were rather grateful to Qiao Ruhai.

No matter what, Qiao Ruhai raised their daughter. If it wasn’t for him, they wouldn’t have reunited with their daughter. Qiao Ruhai rubbed his hands and looked uncomfortable. He knew that he wasn’t welcome, so he found a bench and sat down.

Almost everyone from the Bai, Mo, and Qiao families was here.

Mo Shixiu was invited by the foreign royal family and went overseas. Jiang Luoli and her daughter were with him. At this time, the family of three was overseas and couldn’t rush back.

After waiting for about half an hour, the door to the delivery room finally opened.

Mo Yesi rushed over.

The nurse who came out first was carrying the newborn baby. She congratulated Mo Yesi with a smile. “Mr. Mo, congratulations. Mrs. Mo gave birth to a young master for you. Look, the baby is so beautiful.” Mo Yesi looked down at his newly born son and didn’t even see what he looked like. He looked up and asked anxiously, “Where’s my wife?”

Just as he said that two more nurses pushed Qiao Mianmian out. Mo Yesi didn’t care about the baby anymore. He walked past the nurse carrying the baby to the cart, bent down, and gently held Qiao Mianmian’s hand.

His eyes were deep and slightly moist. He looked at Qiao Mianmian, who was sweating profusely, and kissed the back of her hand. “Mianmian, thank you.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Hubby, we have a son.” Qiao Mianmian held his hand and smiled. “Don’t be like this, be happier. Actually, it doesn’t hurt at all to have a child. It really doesn’t hurt at all after the painkillers.”

Qiao Mianmian felt that childbirth was a blessing for women.

It wasn’t as scary as she imagined. It was even easier than she imagined. She’d just given birth, but she was already thinking of having another child.
