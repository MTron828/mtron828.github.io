Chapter 1635: Let Us Get Married

Xie Zewen was her childhood sweetheart.

They were in the same school from elementary school to middle school.

When she went to the high school in the city, she and Xie Zewen weren’t in the same school. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Jiang Luoli trusted him.

She knew what kind of person Xie Zewen was.

She just didn’t understand why he was here.

Where did Father Jiang and Mother Jiang send her after she fainted?

Xie Zewen looked at her and hesitated for a few seconds before saying, “Luoli, your parents handed you to me and asked me to take you away. This is S City, a beautiful and suitable city to live in. I...”

“Brother Zewen.” Jiang Luoli frowned and interrupted him. “My parents asked you to take me away, and you agreed to it? Also, why did you bring me here? What did they ask you to do?”

Xie Zewen looked at her silently for a while before saying softly, “Luoli, your parents told me that someone wants to harm you. That person is very powerful and not someone the Jiang Family can go against. If I don’t take you away, they won’t let you off.”

“They said... they said...” Xie Zewen looked up at Jiang Luoli and looked a little uncomfortable. He hesitated for a while before saying, “They said that as long as we get married, they won’t make things difficult for you anymore.”

Jiang Luoli’s expression changed. “Married?”

“Yes, yes.” Xie Zewen looked up at her again and clenched his fists. “Uncle and Aunt mean... to get us married and settle down in this city.

“That’s why they asked me to take you away.

“This, this will be our new home in the future. Luoli, although I can’t give you a rich life, I’ll do my best to treat you well.”

Jiang Luoli’s face turned pale.

She took a deep breath and got off the bed.

Her legs were still a little weak, so she almost lost her balance when she tried to get up.

Xie Zewen immediately went over to help her up.

Jiang Luoli avoided his hand and supported herself against the wall.

“Brother Zewen, are you kidding? How could we get married?” Jiang Luoli was shocked and angry. “I don’t know what my parents told you, but I have no intention of marrying you.

“I’m still studying, so I won’t consider marriage.

“If you’re under some sort of pressure to agree to such an absurd request, then I...”

“No, no one forced me!” Xie Zewen clenched his fists and blushed. He looked at her and then lowered his eyes. “Luoli, actually, when Uncle and Aunt told me about this, I was very surprised.

“I never expected such a good thing to happen to me.”

Jiang Luoli widened her eyes. “Brother Zewen, you...”

“Luoli, actually, I... I’ve liked you since we were little.” Xie Zewen was flustered, but he still summoned up his courage and said, “Marrying you and becoming your husband has always been my dream.

“So, I... I did it willingly.

“I heard from Uncle and Aunt that the person who asked you to leave is very powerful.”
