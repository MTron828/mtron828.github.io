Chapter 366: So Adorable That He Wanted to Kiss Her

The two other men were also shocked. They grumbled as they zipped up their pants. As they turned around and were prepared to lash out at Qiao Mianmian, they became shocked when they saw her, just like the guy who blushed previously.

They blushed as well.

“I’m so sorry.” Qiao Mianmian apologized. “I’m here for someone. I’ll leave shortly.”

Upon finishing what she had to say, she immediately headed to Mo Yesi. She squatted down and patted him on the back, asking, “Mo Yesi, are you ok? What’s wrong with you?”

Upon hearing her voice, Mo Yesi immediately turned around.

He noticed the men staring at her, frowned, immediately covered her eyes, and slammed the door shut.

“Why are you in here?”

He said with a low and angry voice, “How can you come in here?”

“I heard you vomiting from the outside.”

Qiao Mianmian moved his hand away and stared at him. She held onto his hand tightly and said worryingly, “I was afraid that something happened to you and rushed in.

“Are you ok? What’s wrong? Should we go to the hospital?”

She knew that she wasn’t supposed to be in the men’s room.

But she couldn’t care less.

“I’m fine,” Mo Yesi replied as he flushed the toilet. He took a deep breath before standing up.

As he looked at her, he kept quiet for a while before patting her and gently saying, “Don’t worry. I’m fine. Really. It’s just that my body isn’t used to eating so much spicy food.”

Qiao Mianmian was shocked. She bit her lip and said, “Why didn’t you tell me that you aren’t used to eating spicy food.”

She previously gave him a lot of spicy food.

He couldn’t handle it, but he didn’t want to tell her and ate everything she gave him.

This man...

Mo Yesi said nonchalantly, “You said that it was great. I wanted to try it. I can handle some spicy food occasionally.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

He was still lying to her.

Did he think that she was stupid?

It was obvious that he couldn’t handle spicy food.

If not, he wouldn’t be vomiting now.

It was obvious to Qiao Mianmian why he was willing to finish the food she gave him even though he couldn’t handle spicy food, and why he was still trying to lie to her.

This was the first time she met a man like Mo Yesi.

He forced himself to go through all these just because he didn’t want to dampen the mood.

If it was Su Ze, he wouldn’t be so accommodating. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The better Mo Yesi treated her, the more stressed Qiao Mianmian became.

She couldn’t think of any way to repay him.

“Tell me if you cannot eat any food in the future,” Qiao Mianmian said after hesitating for a moment. She held onto his hands and said with a serious expression, “If you do this again, I will never have any meals with you in the future.”

Mo Yesi was speechless.

Seeing no reaction from him, Qiao Mianmian glared at him, held onto his hands harder, and fiercely said, “Did you hear what I said!”

Mo Yesi suppressed his urge to laugh, nodded, and said, “Ok.”

She was so adorable when she was trying to be fierce.

So adorable that he wanted to kiss her.
