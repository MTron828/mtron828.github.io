Chapter 2942: I Know I Was Wrong

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

She didn’t dare to ask for forgiveness now. She just hoped that she still had a chance to make it up to him.

“Yes.” Thinking about how Mo Yunchen treated her in the past and hearing his cold and unfamiliar voice, Madam Mo felt sad and couldn’t help but tear up. “Yunchen, I know I did wrong, I also know that my mistake isn’t something that can be exchanged for your forgiveness.

“I didn’t know Tang Ya’s true motive from the start. I never thought that she would target the Mo family. I know that no matter what I say now, I can’t absolve myself of what I did. I’m not here to beg you to forgive me.”

Tears rolled down her cheeks.

“Yunchen, I was wrong. I really know I was wrong this time. How foolish was I to hand my granddaughter over to a bad person?”

“Wenpei, isn’t it too late for you to realize your mistake now? This time, you’ve really gone overboard. Even I can’t forgive you for what you’ve done.” Mo Yunchen sighed when he heard her crying. His tone was no longer as cold, but it wasn’t as gentle and affectionate as before. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“know it’s too late.” Madam Mo wiped her tears and choked. “I know I’m not worthy of your forgiveness. Yunchen, if I say that I really know my mistake this time, will you believe me?”

“believe you.” Mo Yunchen sighed again. “But if you’re just throwing a tantrum, I can still speak up for you and protect you. But you… have you ever thought that if anything happens to Yueyue, Shixiu and Luoli will never forgive you?

“Mom won’t, either.

“We… we can’t go back to how we were.”

Madam Mo’s heart ached even more. “I know, I know.”

Mo Yunchen kept quiet for a while. “Wenpei, since you handed Yueyue to Tang Ya, you must know where she is. Tell me, where is Tang Ya now? We have to find Yueyue immediately.

“Even if Yueyue is safe now, it’s hard to guarantee her safety from now on. Also, do you know why she took Yueyue away?”

“I don’t know where she is, I really don’t know. Yunchen, she lied to me. I thought she wouldn’t do anything to Yueyue, but who knew…” Madam Mo sounded regretful. “I really want to find her now, but she won’t tell me where she is.

“But I know why she took Yueyue away.”

“Why?” Mo Yunchen immediately asked.

Madam Mo was silent.

“Wenpei?” Mo Yunchen was a little anxious. “Why aren’t you saying anything? Tell me, why did she take Yueyue away? Wenpei, say something!”

Madam Mo thought of the woman who had made her uneasy for a long time. Hesitation and struggle flashed in her eyes.

No one knew how long she’d kept Tang Wangiu in her thoughts.

No one knew how long she’d been afraid of her.

It was all because she could feel that Mo Yunchen really liked Tang Wanqiu back then.

If Mo Yunchen hadn’t regained his memory and she hadn’t gone to look for him, he wouldn’t have left Tang Wanqiu.

Even though he returned to Yuncheng City and the Mo family, and on the surface, their lives seemed to have returned to the past, Mo Yunchen called Tang Wangiu’s name in his sleep for a few nights.

Back then, she knew that Mo Yunchen had Tang Wangiu in his heart..
