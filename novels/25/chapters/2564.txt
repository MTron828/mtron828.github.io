“Wow, that’s too terrible. It’s not much different from having a ruined family. Didn’t they say that the Shen Corporation managed to invite Henry Zhou? Perhaps, if the new jewelry sells well, they can make a comeback.”

“Sisters, don’t you know? Henry Zhou won’t be working with the Shen Corporation anymore. Hence, they are doomed this time. There’s no way to turn things around.”

“The Young Lady of the Shen family ended up like this. Sigh, I think it’s better to die.”

There was a commotion on Weibo.

She used to be the proud Young Lady of the Shen family. Many people pursued her, and she was an unattainable goddess in the hearts of many men.

But now, she was in such a pathetic state.

Some netizens felt that she deserved it, and some others felt that she was pitiful.

But no matter what became of Shen Rou, no matter what happened to the Shen family, to the netizens, it was just one of the topics to be discussed over dinner.

It was a pity.

But it was just a few words. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

After sighing, they did what they had to do.

They discussed it for two days, but not long after, the netizens were distracted by other new things.

Soon, Shen Rou was forgotten by the netizens. Not many people remembered her, and not many people discussed her anymore.

Then, Shen Rou and the Shen family were once again remembered by the netizens. Moreover, it was the day that the Shen family declared bankruptcy.

It hadn’t been long since Shen Rou’s car accident.

It had only been half a month.

Initially, the Shen Corporation’s bankruptcy was posted by a financial news officer.

Just like when Shen Rou got into a car accident, not many people believed it at first.

But later, other official Weibo accounts also exposed this matter. After the television station also reported this matter, the netizens finally believed that the Shen Corporation really went bankrupt.

The Shen and Gong families were the same. They were one of the richest families in Yuncheng City.

It had only been half a month, but the Shen family had actually declared bankruptcy.

This made people sigh.

Things were indeed unpredictable.

The once glorious Shen family was gone just like that.

Some reporters went to the Shen Corporation for an interview.

When the current Chairman of the Shen Corporation, Father Shen, came out for an interview, he looked extremely haggard on the camera. In just over 10 days, he seemed to have aged more than 10 years and was no longer as energetic as before.

Father Shen’s eyes were red when talking about the bankruptcy.

The Shen family’s decades of business were ruined by his generation.

How could he not be sad?

“Chairman Shen, it’s said that the Shen Corporation has been acquired by another company. Is this true?” The reporter looked at the haggard old man whose eyes were red. Although he couldn’t bear it, he still had to ask.

This question made Father Shen look even more haggard. His eyes were full of fatigue. After a moment of silence, he said hoarsely, “Yes, I didn’t manage the Shen Corporation well, that’s why it has come to this today.. The Shen Corporation needs to be handed to someone capable.”
