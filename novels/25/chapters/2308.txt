Before she could finish, Old Madam interrupted her. “I’m not angry with you. Wenpei did wrong this time.”

“Grandma isn’t angry?” Qiao Mianmian was really afraid that Old Madam would be angry at her and think that she was rude and insensible.

After all, Old Madam had always been fond of her.

She liked Old Madam too.

She just wanted to be Old Madam’s little cutie.

She didn’t want to be hated by her.

“No.” Old Madam shook her head and sighed. “On the contrary, Grandma appreciates you standing up for your friend at this time. Grandma has very good friends too, so I can understand your feelings.”

Qiao Mianmian heaved a sigh of relief.

Thankfully, Old Madam didn’t think that she was disrespectful.

Although she felt that she was disrespecting her elders just now, she couldn’t bear to see her Luo Luo being bullied.

No matter who bullied her Luo Luo, she would step forward.

“Grandma, I still want to say something for Luo Luo.” Qiao Mianmian hesitated for a while before saying, “Grandma, I know Luo Luo very well. It’s impossible that she made Big Brother withdraw from the election. She got together with Big Brother after accepting his busy work. She isn’t a clingy girl and doesn’t need someone by her side all the time. She definitely won’t make Big Brother give up his work because of her.

“Although I don’t know why Big Brother suddenly withdrew from the election, I’m sure that it wasn’t Luo Luo who made him leave.”

Qiao Mianmian was still afraid that Old Madam would think that Jiang Luoli affected Mo Shixiu’s future.

She knew that Jiang Luoli didn’t want to be hated by Old Madam.

Old Madam was silent for a while before nodding. “I’ll get Shixiu to clarify things. I won’t blame the wrong person.”

Qiao Mianmian wanted to continue, but Mo Yesi interrupted her.

“Alright, Mianmian.” Mo Yesi pulled her back and smiled. “Grandma is a very fair person. She won’t blame anyone. I believe that Big Brother will settle this, so let’s not worry too much.”

Qiao Mianmian nodded.

She also felt that Mo Shixiu should settle this.

He was Jiang Luoli’s husband.

It was up to him to protect his wife.

If he couldn’t settle this and still made Jiang Luoli suffer, she would suspect that he wasn’t a suitable husband.

After all, Jiang Luoli was still pregnant and had to suffer.

She might have to suffer a lot in the future.

At this thought, Qiao Mianmian decided not to interfere. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

…

They left the Mo Residence.

At that moment, Qiao Mianmian didn’t want to return to Lu Shan Courtyard.

Just as she was debating where to go to kill time, Mo Yesi received a call from Yan Shaoqing.

He was on speaker.

Qiao Mianmian heard Yan Shaoqing’s playful voice. “Second Bro, you don’t have anything on tonight, right? Do you want to bring Sis-in-law over to play with us? Tell Sis-in-law that her brother is here too.”

Mo Yesi didn’t answer him. Instead, he turned to Qiao Mianmian and asked, “Baby, do you want to go?”

Before Qiao Mianmian could reply, she heard Yan Shaoqing say, “Tsk tsk, Second Bro, you’re really being controlled by Sis-in-law now.. You even have to ask for her permission to go anywhere.”
