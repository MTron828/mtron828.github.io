Chapter 902: This Is Too... Willful

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Marrying a man like Mo Yesi was really blissful.

Initially, they only got married because of some special reasons.

She had no feelings for him.

Back then, how could she have known that she would fall for him so quickly?

And this liking was getting deeper...

This man was already so charming that women would fall in love with him easily.

He was so nice to her and doted on her...

Unless she had a heart of stone, how could she not be tempted?

She didn’t regret liking him at all.

Because Mo Yesi was a really good man.

...

The place Mo Yesi got someone to find wasn’t too far from the mall. They arrived after 10 minutes.

After getting out of the car, Qiao Mianmian was still empty-handed, and Mo Yesi was still in charge of carrying everything.

The place was naturally a high-end district.

The most luxurious and high-end apartment in F City was a two-bedder room. It wasn’t very big, but it was luxuriously furnished.

It had a fingerprint lock.

Qiao Mianmian looked at Mo Yesi’s fingerprint and couldn’t help but ask curiously, “Why would the apartment here use your fingerprint? Then, after you leave, will your friend have to change the fingerprint lock?”

Mo Yesi opened the door and entered. The lights in the room lit up on their own.

He walked in first, changed his shoes, and then handed Qiao Mianmian a pair of slippers. He then casually replied to her question, “This is my house, of course, you have to use my fingerprint. After you register your fingerprint, you can stay here. Don’t stay in a hotel anymore.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “Your house? Didn’t you ask your friend to help you find it?”

“Mm, I bought it the other day when I found it. Oh right, the renovation was done a long time ago. If you don’t like this style, get someone to renovate it. But if you want to renovate it, you can’t stay here for now.”

Qiao Mianmian was confused.

So, he got someone to help him find a house that day not because he wanted to borrow his friend’s house?

Qiao Mianmian was shocked. “This house was bought that day?”

“Mm.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“So, you got someone to look for the house just to make sweet and sour spare ribs? And then decided to buy it at the last minute?”

“Mm.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“...”

What else could she say?

Just to make sweet and sour spare ribs, he bought this two-bedder apartment at the most prime location in F City!

Even though this apartment wasn’t big, it was about 90 square meters.

According to the property prices in F City, this 90-square-meter house was close to 100 million yuan.

He spent hundreds of millions of yuan on a house just to make sweet and sour spare ribs.

She felt that even if he was rich, he couldn’t be this way.

This was too... wilful.

Hundreds of millions!

Just to make sweet and sour spare ribs.

Did poverty really limit her imagination?

She didn’t even dare to think about it.

Was he trying to get her to smile?

After all, she was the one who suggested eating sweet and sour spare ribs. If she hadn’t mentioned it, he wouldn’t have gotten someone to look for a house. If he hadn’t gotten someone to look for a house, he wouldn’t have bought it.

Qiao Mianmian’s heart ached.
