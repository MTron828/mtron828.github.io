Chapter 2034: That’s Young Lady Shen

The reporters frantically pressed on the shutters, and countless flashlights shone on the artistes.

But the professional artistes were unaffected by the flashlights. They even posed for the reporters to take photos.

Perhaps because too many big shots came tonight, the reporters became bored after a while.

They didn’t get anything interesting.

After all, the content of the annual charity ball was similar.

It was basically a fashion show for all the female celebrities. After the charity banquet ended, they would vote for the top ten best-dressed artistes.

Hence, many female artistes would come in revealing dresses to show off.

Initially, these revealing clothes made people feel like they were worth filming.

But as more and more such artistes appeared and were exposed, it became normal.

Just as the reporters were thinking that tonight would probably be the same as before, a slightly unfamiliar figure walked onto the red carpet.

The woman walking the red carpet was wearing a long, eye-catching red dress. Her skin was fair, and she looked good in this bright red dress.

The woman was tall and had beautiful curves. The red dress she chose showed off her figure.

Her face was extremely beautiful and charming. Compared to ordinary female celebrities, she seemed to have a little more charisma.

It was an aura that only existed in a superior environment.

She was born with a sense of superiority. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Who is that?” A reporter couldn’t help but ask. “She looks unfamiliar. Is she a newbie?”

“What newbie? That’s Young Lady Shen.”

“Young Lady Shen? The one who almost went bankrupt and was rescued?”

“Young Lady Shen is here for the banquet, too. She’s so beautiful. The daughters of rich families are indeed different. They have especially good temperaments.”

“I heard that Qiao Mianmian was also invited tonight. I heard that Young Lady Shen has had a crush on Chairman Mo for many years, but he never accepted her. Even after the Shen family’s incident, the Mo Corporation didn’t help.

“Now that Qiao Mianmian is dating Chairman Mo, isn’t this slapping her in the face? He’d rather choose a newbie with an average family background than her. She must be very angry. Do you think it’ll be exciting if she meets Qiao Mianmian tonight?”

The atmosphere was filled with gossip.

Initially, they didn’t think it was anything special, that it’d be just like the previous years. But now, there were a lot of headlines.

The two people attending the banquet tonight.

One was Mo Yesi’s current girlfriend.

The other was his childhood sweetheart.

If they met at the banquet, it would definitely be exciting.

The man that Young Lady Shen had liked for so many years and couldn’t get was taken down by a newbie.

She must be very unhappy with Qiao Mianmian.

“Miss Shen, look over here.” The reporter waved his arms and shouted at Shen Rou.

On the red carpet.

Shen Rou turned around and posed for the reporters to take photos.

Shen Rou had outstanding looks and a good figure. She was also from a prestigious family.
