He stared at the soft and cute girl in his arms, his eyes deep and dark, and couldn’t help but reach out to gently squeeze her fair and soft cheeks.

The girl’s face was fair and tender and soft to the touch, like an egg.

Mo Yesi’s eyes softened at the sight of her curled up in his arms like a kitten.

The grave and stern contours of his face also became a lot softer.

When Madam Mo finished speaking, he said with a smile, “Don’t worry, Madam Mo. You’ll definitely see it in the future.”

“What are you saying?” Madam Mo’s tone changed. “Did something happen to you?”

Mo Yesi had always been silent when she talked about such things.

But this time, he had actually responded to her.

Looking down at Qiao Mianmian, Mo Yesi said in a gentle voice, “Prepare more light food and let people boil some brown sugar water in advance. I’ll go back later.”

“What- what? Brown sugar water?” Madam Mo was dazed.

“Yes, add some ginger and red dates as well. Okay, I’m hanging up. We’ll talk when I return home.”

He hung up the phone after he finished speaking.

Qiao Mianmian listened to him speaking on the phone and looked up at him with dark eyes. “Your mother called you?”

He nodded and smirked, speaking out to correct her, “Baby, she’s your mother too.”

Qiao Mianmian was a little stunned and embarrassed.

She was married to Mo Yesi.

His mother was indeed her mother.

But she still wasn’t used to their marriage, let alone changing her greetings.

She blushed a little and pursed her lips. “Your mom... Does Mother want you to go back?”

“Yeah.” Mo Yesi groaned, and then asked her in a consulting tone, “Do you want to go back with me?”

He and Qiao Mianmian had gotten married hastily.

He hadn’t had time to bring her back to the old house to see his family.

However, Shen Rou’s words had reminded him that his original plan had been to bring her home in the near future.

Coincidentally, Madam Mo had called him to go home today, so he was thinking of bringing the plan forward.

Qiao Mianmian was startled. “Go home with you? You mean, to see your family?”

“Yes.”

Mo Yesi caressed her head and said gently, “Mianmian, we’re already married. I’ve already met your family, but you’ve never met mine. I want to take you home and introduce you to them.”

Qiao Mianmian suddenly became nervous.

“See- see your family?” She bit her lip. “But I’m not prepared.”

Although she was now married to Mo Yesi, she didn’t want to be taken home by him so soon.

She just wanted them to live their own lives.

She was a little afraid of going home with him to see his parents.

At the thought of the fight in prestigious families as seen on TV, she felt a sense of resistance. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Mo Yesi treated her very well and pampered her.

But as for his family...

A super-wealthy family like the Mo family must be a group of very powerful people.

Too powerful people weren’t easy to get along with.

“Don’t worry, there’s no need to be afraid.” Mo Yesi could tell that she was nervous, so he caressed her head soothingly and said in a softer, gentler voice, “With me around, nobody can do anything to you.

“Furthermore, Baby, you’re so good. My family will definitely like you.”

“But...”

“Mianmian, what are you worried about?” Mo Yesi stared at her gently. “Are you afraid that you won’t get along with my family, and they’ll make things difficult for you?”
