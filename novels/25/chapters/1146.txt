Chapter 1149: Deal

“That’s why I’m not afraid.

“It’s not like I don’t have a way out. Why should I be afraid?”

Her words made the man laugh lightly. “Yes, if you’re terminated, I’ll support you. I’ll immediately set up a management company and only sign you as an artiste. Then, I’ll set up a film company and only shoot scenes for you to be the female lead.”

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but laugh. She stretched out a finger and playfully said, “Really? Then, we have a deal.”

Mo Yesi didn’t mind her childish behavior. He stretched out a finger and hooked it with hers. “Okay, it’s a deal.”

“But I might have to trouble you a little.” Qiao Mianmian’s Weibo post was considered public, but not entirely.

It wasn’t completely public because she did not publicly announce her marriage.

Regarding this matter, she still had her original plans.

She wanted to hold a wedding after graduation and announce it to the public.

“Hm?” Mo Yesi was already very surprised.

Qiao Mianmian took out her Weibo post and handed it to him. “I don’t want anyone to know about our marriage yet. You won’t be angry, right? If you mind it, I can make it public again.”

Mo Yesi took the phone and looked down.

Qiao Mianmian’s message was: “Thank you for caring so much about my personal feelings. Since everyone is so curious, then I’ll be frank. I do have a financier, and he’s indeed a rich and powerful man, the kind that I can rely on. This man is my boyfriend, the man who treats me the best in the world, and also the person I love the most. Because he’s an outsider, I don’t want him to be embroiled in the entertainment industry, so I won’t reveal who he is to everyone. One more thing to clarify is that Mr. Gong and I are just ordinary friends. I’m indebted to him for his help, and that’s on account of my boyfriend. I hope everyone will stop spreading rumors about us. As for my abortion in high school, I don’t want to talk too much about it. I’ll hand everything over to the lawyer, and I’ll have them pay the price for spreading rumors. I won’t let anyone off.”

Qiao Mianmian had just posted on Weibo and didn’t look at it again.

Now that she logged in, she realized that her Weibo had more than 20,000 comments and more than 10,000 reposts.

The number of reposts and comments was comparable to that of an A-list celebrity.

Speaking of which, Qiao Mianmian was definitely an exception amongst the newcomers.

Other than those minor roles, she didn’t have any decent works.

She was a rookie with zero works.

However, a rookie like her could actually appear on Weibo’s hot searches every now and then.

Moreover, she gained more than a million fans through various scandals.

Every time she posted something on Weibo, the number of comments and reposts was almost the same as A-list celebrities.

These were all real data. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

It was different from some celebrities who bought reposts and comments.

She was probably one of those who were forced to become black and red.

Many artistes wanted to walk the black and red path instead of becoming popular through the orthodox path.

However, the black and red road was not that easy to walk.

It wasn’t easy to walk away.

In the industry, some celebrities managed to climb up the social ladder using underhanded means. After they became popular, they would then use other methods to clear their names.

For now, they were doing well.

Qiao Mianmian had never thought of becoming famous like this, but she was now using this method to become famous.
