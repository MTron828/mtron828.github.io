Chapter 68: You Vile Woman

He was practically rolling in pain, but he still shouted. “You bitches, I’m going to kill you. I’m going to kill you!”

With that, they kicked him on the other leg.

This time, he passed out from the pain.

Shen Yueyue could feel her legs shaking as she watched what happened.

When the bodyguard went over to grab her, she lost all her strength and begged meekly. “Please, don’t break my legs. Don’t!”

Zhao Wanting sat on the floor in utter shock.

They were only students.

Although they were arrogant and intimidating for many, they had never witnessed such violence before.

They were now shaking in fear looking at the unconscious and broken-legged Du Ze.

“Miss Qiao, are both of them your schoolmates? How would Miss Qiao like us to deal with them?” The same leader walked towards Qiao Mianmian and gave her a deep bow before asking her.

“Mianmian, we’re in the wrong. Please let us off.”

“Mianmian, please forgive us this time on the account that we’re roommates.” They trembled even more vigorously now when they thought about their legs being broken.

At this point, both of them looked pathetic with all their tears and snot.

Qiao Mianmian eyed them coldly.

“Mianmian.” Jiang Luoli said angrily, “You can’t forgive them so easily. They were being too much.”

If it wasn’t for Su Ze’s swift intervention, things would have turned out really bad.

On that thought, Jiang Luoli scanned the surroundings.

Where was Su Ze?

Why wasn’t he around?

Was he in hiding because he didn’t think it was appropriate to show up?

“Luo Luo, don’t worry. I’m not a saint.”

She gave her a smile and then turned to face Shen Yueyue and Zhao Wanting. She thought for a while and then said, “Deal with them as per normal. Do what has to be done.”

Shen Yueyue’s actions definitely would result in some punishment from the school.

For a third-year student in university, with only one year to graduation, there was nothing worse than expulsion.

Although this might ruin her future, she was the one being mean in the first place.

The bodyguard nodded. “Alright, I know what Miss Qiao means.”

With that, he waved his hand casually and said, “Take them away first.”

Shen Yueyue and Qiao Mianmian got even more panicked when they heard this. “Mianmian, we’ve realized our mistakes. Please give us a chance to correct ourselves.”

“It’s true! We’re good friends who’ve been roommates for three years. Can’t you just forgive us once?”

Qiao Mianmian walked towards them. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

She looked down at them coldly and uttered every word clearly and coldly, “You’re wrong, I’ve never been good friends with you. And, I only forgive those who’re sincere about repenting. People like you don’t mean what you say. I won’t give you another chance.”

Upon realizing that their pleading wasn’t getting them anywhere, their faces changed instantly. “Qiao Mianmian, you vile woman! How could you be so ruthless and heartless towards your friends who’ve shared a room with you for years? You’re going to get your retribution!”

“No wonder Young Master Su broke up with you. No man would ever like a woman like you.”
