Chapter 513: So, You Agreed to It?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Chairman Mo, I’ve got the clothes.” Wei Zheng hung his head low, wishing he could disappear right away.

“Mm.” Mo Yesi was tapping the desk. “Put it down and you can go.”

“Yes.”

Wei Zheng hurriedly placed the bags on the couch and was ready to leave.

He didn’t even glance at Mo Yesi again.

At the door.

“Hold on, come back.”

He stiffened and turned around slowly. “Chairman Mo, do you have other instructions?”

“Postpone the appointment this afternoon to another time. Then, book a Western restaurant for me.”

“Yes, Chairman Mo.”

He didn’t even have to say this. Wei Zheng already knew that he wouldn’t be meeting his client today.

Since Young Madam was here, Chairman Mo was surely going to spend his time with her.

She was way more important than any client.

“One more thing.” Mo Yesi narrowed his eyes. “Has the ownership for the Qiao family villa been transferred yet? Hand me the deed.”

“Chairman Mo, the Qiao family...” Wei Zheng’s expression changed slightly.

“What?” Mo Yesi sounded slightly threatening. “It’s been days, and you haven’t settled this? When has your efficiency deteriorated so much.”

“No, Chairman Mo...”

Mo Yesi sounded casual about it, but Wei Zheng felt threatened.

Boss was suggesting that he wasn’t efficient anymore? What was that supposed to mean?

It was too scary.

He quickly explained, “Qiao Ruhai originally already agreed to transfer it to us. But this morning, when I went to him to settle the paperwork, he went back on his word. He said he’d find a way to get the money and asked for just two more days.”

“So, you agreed to it?”

Wei Zheng’s heart rate went from a steady 70 beats per minute to 120. “He refused to sign the papers, there was nothing we could do. After all, h-he’s Young Madam’s father.

“We couldn’t really do anything to him.”

Wei Zheng wouldn’t have had such concerns if this was just a stranger.

They could do anything they wished to whoever went against them.

But Qiao Ruhai wasn’t just anybody.

Even if Young Madam’s relationship with him wasn’t good, he was still her biological father, after all.

If they dealt with Qiao Ruhai the way they dealt with others, it wasn’t possible for Young Madam not to mind at all.

And if this affected Young Madam and Chairman Mo’s relationship, it would be terrible.

Chairman Mo wanted the villa as a surprise for Young Madam.

Mo Yesi kept quiet for a while before saying, “No matter what, we have to transfer that villa to Mianmian. Since he doesn’t want to sell it, then give him some more incentives. The Qiao family company is nothing more than a shell company now. There’s no money he can get out of it. If he wants funds urgently, he’d have to turn to his other daughter and the Su chap, but they might not be willing to give it to him.

“Just give him a day. When he’s utterly hopeless, he’ll just sell it to us.”

“Yes, Chairman Mo. I know what to do.

“Oh, right. Chairman Mo...”

Wei Zheng suddenly thought of something, but he seemed almost pained to talk about it.

“Get straight to the point.” Mo Yesi was slightly annoyed. “If not, forget it.”Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎
