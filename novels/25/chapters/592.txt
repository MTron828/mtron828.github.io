The man’s voice became deeper and hoarser.

Qiao Mianmian’s heartbeat accelerated as she felt her body getting hotter.

“Do you really not want to turn around and look at me?”

A moment later, Qiao Mianmian heard the man sigh and say, “Alright, don’t look if you don’t want to. I won’t force you.”

Finishing his words, he loosened his arms around her.

She felt his domineering aura slowly dissipate.

Afterward, she heard a rusting sound. She heard a voice saying, “Baby, you can turn around now. I’ve finished changing.”

So, he was changing his clothes just now.

Qiao Mianmian did not doubt him and turned around.

Who knew that when she turned around, she saw Mo Yesi wearing only the tie she bought him. Pulling the tie, he looked at her seductively.

He smirked, revealing his wicked thoughts.

Qiao Mianmian was stunned. When she came to her senses, her face immediately turned red.

Looking at the seductive scene in front of her, her heartbeat accelerated as her face flushed with redness. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Her throat and mouth dried...

She swallowed her saliva. Although she wanted to look away, she couldn’t stop staring at his chest and abs.

She couldn’t bear to look away.

Her heart raced as she stared at his sexy and well-defined muscles. She was starting to lose control of herself.

Mo Yesi... This man’s body was too good.

He was so sexy that he could make a woman burn with passion.

At that moment, she very much wanted to do it with him.

If not for his beastly stamina and crazy strength, she would have gone for it.

But after having a first-hand experience of his stamina in bed, she didn’t dare to approach him first.

“Mo Yesi, didn’t you say you were done changing?” Qiao Mianmian looked at him innocently. After staring for a bit, she unwillingly looked away.

But she would still glance at his chest with the corner of her eyes.

Those well-defined chest muscles were very alluring.

It was as if they were carved out.

But, she had touched them previously and was aware of how nice they felt.

It was an addictive touch.

She couldn’t forget how they felt after she touched them.

If she didn’t personally experience him in bed, she wouldn’t have been able to control herself.

She would have rushed over and touched him.

“Yes, I’ve finished changing.” Mo Yesi narrowed his eyes. He took a step forward, fixed his gaze on her, and said, “I’ve just tried on the tie. I like it very much.”

As the man approached her, Qiao Mianmian felt engulfed by his aggressive presence.

He cornered her.

She felt like she had nowhere to escape.

Seeing his dark eyes, she suddenly started to panic...

Instinctively, she took a step back and accidentally bumped into the coffee table.

She almost lost her balance and fell.

“Baby, be careful.”
