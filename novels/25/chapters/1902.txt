Chapter 1905: Who Allowed You to Touch My Things?

For a small artiste like Song Ke, if she didn’t know what was good for her, it wouldn’t be as simple as just removing her spot on a variety show.

After the staff member finished speaking, he ignored her and left.

Little Xiao and Qiao Anxin had yet to leave when they witnessed the scene of Mo Yesi kicking Song Ke. Both of their expressions turned ugly.

They were a little shocked.

“Song Ke, I think you’d better hurry up and pack up.” Little Xiao looked down at her as if trying to persuade her. As if it was for her own good. “That person was right just now. You’d better do as Mr. Mo says, or else you’ll be the one suffering.”

“Little Xiao, don’t f*cking gloat.” Song Ke gritted her teeth and glared at her. “Even if I’m unlucky, do you think you’ll be any better? And you, too, Qiao Anxin. I can tell what you’re thinking. Do you think Qiao Mianmian can’t?

“You lust after her man. Do you think she’ll make it easy for you?

“Just you wait. It’s your turn next.”

“Is that so?” Regarding her words, Little Xiao indifferently curled her lips. “I’m not as stupid as some people. If you have time to worry about others, you should worry more about your own matters.”

After saying that, she left.

After Little Xiao left, Qiao Anxin squatted down and looked at Song Ke lying on the ground in pain. She smiled and reached out a hand.

Song Ke was stunned and looked at her in shock.

Qiao Anxin remained silent.

Song Ke looked at her suspiciously. After hesitating for a few seconds, she reached out.

Qiao Anxin helped her up.

Halfway through, she suddenly let go.

Song Ke fell to the ground again.

Furious, she raised her head and roared, “Qiao Anxin, you...”

Qiao Anxin stood and looked down at her. She smiled coldly and said, “Song Ke, I just want you to get used to the feeling of falling on the ground. Anyway, you’re going to fall even harder than this.

“I don’t know if I’ll have a good life in the future, but I know that you definitely won’t have a good one. Do you still want to continue in the entertainment industry? Hehe, keep dreaming.”

Qiao Anxin left soon after.

Song Ke was lying on the ground with a pale face. Her knee hurt so much that she couldn’t even stand up. In the end, a staff member helped her up.

Song Ke had just returned to her room when she saw two staff members inside. They were packing up her things.

They were almost done packing. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“What are you doing?” Song Ke was so angry that her face turned green.

“Miss Song, we’re helping you pack your luggage. We’re almost done. Miss Song, come and check if we missed anything. If not, we’ll send you off immediately.”

“How can you do this?” Song Ke trembled with anger. “Who allowed you to touch my things?”

The two staff members looked at each other and said, “We saw Miss Song fall and couldn’t move properly, so we helped you clean up.”

Song Ke was speechless.

How could she not know that they were anxious for her to leave?

Everything was because of that man called Mo Yesi.

No one dared to ignore his words.
