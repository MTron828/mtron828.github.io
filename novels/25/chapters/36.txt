Chapter 37: Losing Him, You Will Feel Pain

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian was stunned for a few seconds and blushed fiercely.

Her face was very hot as if a fire was burning it. “Mo Yesi, you, don’t joke with me.”

“It’s not a joke.” The man looked directly into her eyes, and there was an undisguised desire in them. “Mianmian, I really want you.”

“You...”

Qiao Mianmian faced those scorching eyes full of deep desire, feeling panicked and wanting to run away.

She blushed terribly and stood up anxiously. “I’m going to the bathroom.”

Then, she almost fled.

She rinsed cold water on her face for a long time before she felt her face cool down.

Her beating heart slowly calmed down.

But when she thought of what the man just said, her heartbeat sped up again.

He had said: Mianmian, I really want you.

The low, sexy voice seemed to ring in her ear again. Qiao Mianmian stretched out her hand and covered her still hot face. She was just about to leave the bathroom when she heard a familiar voice behind her.

“Sister? Is that you?”

Qiao Mianmian went quiet.

Was she really out of luck today?

Otherwise, how could she meet Qiao Anxin at this restaurant again?

Before she spoke, she heard Qiao Anxin’s voice again. “It really is you. Why did you come to this restaurant, did you make an appointment?”

Qiao Mianmian turned around.

Seeing Qiao Anxin’s annoying face, she was so annoyed that she didn’t give her a good attitude. “What does it have to do with you why I’m here? Make way, don’t block my road.”

Qiao Anxin stood still.

Her eyes were judgemental. “Sister, this restaurant is the highest-end western restaurant in Yuncheng. To eat here, you have to book at least half a month in advance. Moreover, the minimum single consumption is not less than five figures.”

“According to Sister’s current economic situation, I’m afraid that you cannot afford such a place.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Qiao Mianmian looked at her coldly. “Oh, really? So?”

Qiao Anxin bit her lower lip and said softly, “Sister, I know that after Brother Ah Ze broke his engagement with you, you have suffered a lot. After all, you have known each other for so many years, so even if you have no love, you still have affection. Losing him would surely be painful.

“However, you can’t let yourself go because of this. Our Qiao family also has a certain status in Yuncheng. If you let others know that you went to find big money, this thing will spread really unpleasantly. By then, how will our Qiao family have the face to go out?

“If Sister wants to find another boyfriend, there are a lot of young unmarried boys in Brother Ah Ze’s company. We can help you find a reliable man. Sister, you...”

“Qiao Anxin, are you done?”

Qiao Mianmian was so sick that she was about to vomit out last night’s dinner, so she interrupted her relentlessly.

“Sister.” Qiao Anxin bit her lip and looked at her sadly. “It’s all for your own good. I really don’t want to see you continue to lose yourself.”

“Oh, lose myself?” Qiao Mianmian just thought it was ridiculous.

She narrowed her cold and taunting eyes and looked at Qiao Anxin’s pleasantly gentle face without any warmth in them.

She took a step forward.

“Sister, what do you want to do!” Qiao Anxin covered her face immediately and hurriedly took a step back.

She had been slapped by Qiao Mianmian before.
