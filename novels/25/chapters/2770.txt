Chapter 2771: But She’s Not as Good-Looking as You

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

But Su Ze didn’t expect Gong Zeli to react this way.

He didn’t seem interested in Qiao Anxin at all.

Su Ze was afraid that he would implicate himself because of Qiao Anxin, so he had to cut ties with her at the crucial moment.

Su Ze waited for a while, but Gong Ze didn’t say anything.

A little curious, he couldn’t help but look up.

The handsome man sitting on the black leather chair seemed to be lost in thought.

Afraid of losing everything he had now, Su Ze decided not to care about Qiao Anxin’s life and death anymore. He anxiously clarified their relationship again. “Chairman Gong, I didn’t know Jiang Xinyue before. Someone introduced her to me. Actually, I didn’t want to sign her, but she cried and told me that she really wanted to enter this industry and begged me to give her a chance. I admit… I only signed her out of pity because she looks similar to Qiao Mianmian.

“I also decided to groom her because she looks like Qiao Mianmian.”

Feeling the cold gaze on him again, Su Ze said with difficulty, “After all, I’ve known Qiao Mianmian for so many years. Looking at her face, I really can’t bear… to reject her.”

“They look alike?” Gong Zeli finally asked.

This question surprised Su Ze.

Stunned for a moment, he then replied immediately, “Yes, I thought Chairman Gong had already seen her photo. She and Qiao Mianmian… I think they’re at least 60% alike.”

“60%?” Gong Zeli sounded a little strange.

Su Ze was stunned for a while before replying, “Yes, their eyes and noses are alike. When I first saw Jiang Xinyue, I thought she was Qiao Mianmian.”

Gong Zeli fell into a strange silence.

A moment later.

“Alright, you may leave.”

This sentence was like being pardoned from the death sentence to Su Ze. He let out a long sigh and wiped the cold sweat off his forehead. “Yes, Chairman Gong. I’ll leave first.”

With that, he didn’t dare to stay any longer and quickly left the office.

…

After Su Ze left, Gong Zeli searched for Jiang Xinyue’s photo.

Looking at the woman in the photo who looked like Qiao Mianmian, his gaze lingered on her dark eyes that were almost identical to Qiao Mianmian’s. He pursed his lips, and his long and narrow eyes flickered.

He didn’t expect Jiang Xinyue to be more like Qiao Mianmian than Su Su.

Her eyes… were too similar to Qiao Mianmian’s.

Even the mole under the corner of her eye.

…

Qiao Mianmian waited at the hotel for the others.

Then, they took the bus with the production crew.

On the way, Zhan Bo whispered to her, “Qiao Mianmian, do you know that a newbie who looks like you is also participating in this show? She has the title of ‘Little Qiao Mianmian’ now.

“I heard that this newbie has a strong background. The show has already started, but she can still replace Zhizhi. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“I used my alternate account to watch her live stream. She does look a little like you. But she’s not as good-looking as you. Your facial features are much more exquisite.”

As cameras and cell phones were always facing them, they had to whisper to each other..
