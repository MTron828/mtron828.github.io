Chapter 936: She’s My Baby

“Mr. Tu, thank you for stepping forward to help Mianmian.” Mo Yesi wrapped an arm around Qiao Mianmian’s waist and pulled her into his embrace as if he was declaring his sovereignty in front of everyone. “If you hadn’t stepped forward in time, I don’t dare to imagine the consequences.

“You’ve done Mianmian a huge favor. I’m afraid we won’t be able to fully repay it.”

Tu Yilei’s gaze fell on the arm around Qiao Mianmian’s waist, and his already dull eyes became even more lifeless.

He suppressed the bitterness in his heart and forced a smile. “Mr. Mo, you’re too polite. This isn’t a favor. You don’t owe me anything, you don’t have to repay me. Under such circumstances, as a man, I have to step forward.

“I just did what most men would do. You don’t have to owe me anything.”

Mo Yesi smiled. “You’re right, but Mianmian does owe Mr. Tu a favor.”

As Mo Yesi spoke, he reached out to push Qiao Mianmian’s hair away from her chest, as if he was combing her hair. His actions were gentle and loving. “If it wasn’t for Mr. Tu standing up for Mianmian and blocking the acid, I’m afraid...

“Mr. Tu has done my Mianmian a great service, this favor must be repaid.”

Qiao Mianmian’s hair just about covered the hickeys on her neck.

With Mo Yesi’s push, it was all revealed.

As the kiss was very eye-catching, Tu Yilei noticed it very quickly.

Seeing the red marks on her neck, he felt as if something had stabbed him in the heart. His heart tightened as a sharp pain spread to every part of his body.

He knew what the red marks meant.

It was precisely because he was clear about it that his heart ached.

As a man, he knew Mo Yesi’s actions very well. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

It was a declaration of sovereignty.

Mo Yesi was telling him that Qiao Mianmian was already his woman.

He could tell that he had feelings for her.

This was a declaration of sovereignty and a warning.

Looking at Tu Yilei’s pale face, Mo Yesi smiled again and patted Qiao Mianmian’s head. His gentle voice was full of love. “If I don’t compensate Mr. Tu, I’m afraid Mianmian will have something against me.

“She’s my baby. I’ve always been obedient to her, and I can’t bear to make her sad. Today, I saw that my baby was unhappy, so I asked her why. She told me that it was because of Mr. Tu.

“She said that Mr. Tu was injured because of her. She was worried that the injury on Mr. Tu’s hand would affect his career.

“If Mr. Tu’s career and future are affected because he helped her, she’ll feel guilty for the rest of her life.”

At this point, Mo Yesi smiled and turned to look at Michael. “I’m sorry, I accidentally overheard Mr. Tu’s conversation with you. It seems like this has already caused a lot of damage to Mr. Tu’s career?”
