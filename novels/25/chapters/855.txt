Chapter 857: Became Popular

“Don’t think I don’t know what rumors you’ve been spreading. I’ve been ignoring you all this while, and you’re all taking it for real?

“If anyone dares to spout nonsense again, I’ll rip his mouth off.”

When Bai Yusheng said that Qiao Mianmian was his cousin, everyone was shocked.

Qiao Mianmian was shocked too.

When did she... become Bai Yusheng’s cousin?

But she didn’t ask on the spot.

The producer was stunned for a few seconds before turning to size her up. “Miss Qiao is Director Bai’s cousin?”

Qiao Mianmian hesitated for a while before nodding. “Mm, Brother Bai is my cousin.”

“So, it’s a cousin.”

The producer was stunned for a few more seconds.

“No wonder Director Bai took such good care of her. We have to take good care of her as a family. Since Miss Qiao is Director Bai’s cousin, she’ll be our cousin from now on. Director Bai, don’t worry, we’ll definitely take good care of her.”

Those who guessed that Bai Yusheng liked Qiao Mianmian were also shocked.

This answer was obviously out of their expectations.

But soon, they believed him.

Bai Yusheng had been in the entertainment industry for so many years, but he had never touched a woman.

Why did he suddenly fall in love with a newbie?

This didn’t seem like his usual style.

So, she was his little cousin.

That would explain his actions.

How could he not take special care of his relatives?

Previously, he pretended not to know her because he didn’t want others to know about his relationship with Qiao Mianmian.

The reason why he chose to say it today was probably that the rumors about the production crew were getting out of hand. If he didn’t deny it now, it would definitely harm her in the future.

After believing that Qiao Mianmian was Bai Yusheng’s cousin, the female artistes who were jealous of her immediately wanted to get close to her.

In their hearts, Qiao Mianmian was no longer that hateful woman who snatched Director Bai away.

It was a piece of cake that they wanted to get to know.

This was Director Bai’s sister.

If they could build a good relationship with her, they would definitely benefit in the future.

A female artiste immediately brought a glass of wine to Qiao Mianmian and politely offered her a toast.

Some of the other female artistes saw it and brought their glasses over as well.

After the female artiste was done with the toast, the other crew members also tried to respect her as their “cousin.”

To them, Qiao Mianmian’s identity as their “cousin” was much more reliable than their little lover’s. It was a status that was worth befriending.

Although newbies were pampered for a while, they might not be pampered in the future.

But relatives would always be relatives.

It was definitely more important than a little lover.

Qiao Mianmian was instantly in high demand, while Bai Yusheng, who was supposed to be the main character, was left out. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Because of Bai Yusheng’s greeting, Qiao Mianmian drank lemonade when she toasted others.

After a round of toasts, Tu Yilei, who had been sitting on the other side of the sofa, slowly stood up and walked towards her with a glass of wine.

“Miss Qiao.” The lights in the private room were a little dim, and Tu Yilei’s figure was stretched out on the ground. When he was a few steps away from Qiao Mianmian, he stopped and looked down. “I’ll give you a toast too. Today’s cooperation was very pleasant. I hope our future cooperation will continue smoothly.”
