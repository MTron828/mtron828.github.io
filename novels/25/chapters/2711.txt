Chapter 2714: Looks Like You’re Satisfied With Her

“Master Li is indeed Master Li. You’ve really won my heart.” The director patted Li Ping’s shoulder and smiled happily. He looked so satisfied it was as if he’d picked up gold.

Li Ping also smiled. “We’ve worked together so many times, of course, I know you. To be honest, you’ve found a good second female lead. She’s really a beauty. Her looks are top-notch in the entertainment industry.”

The director was even more amused. He placed a hand on Li Ping’s shoulder and said smugly, “Of course, my judgment isn’t bad. Let me tell you, not only is she good-looking, but her acting is also very good.

“When she first came for the audition, I thought she was just a pretty vase. I didn’t expect her acting skills to surprise me. At that time, I thought that her looks and aura were too delicate, and I was worried that she wouldn’t be able to play this role. But now, it seems like this role was made for her.”

Thankfully, he gave this role to Qiao Mianmian.

No matter how he looked at it now, he felt like he’d earned it.

Back then, Qiao Mianmian was still a newbie.

And now, she had become the most popular starlet.

She was far more popular than she was back then.

Qiao Mianmian could already bring a lot of popularity to this movie.

“It seems like you’re very satisfied with her.” Li Ping glanced at Qiao Mianmian and had to admit that this actress was indeed very beautiful. She was so beautiful that even he, who was used to seeing beauties in the entertainment industry, was stunned.

She really deserved to be called a beauty.

She didn’t need any makeup or filter. She was already shockingly beautiful in real life.

“It’s really good.” The director looked delighted.

“It’s good that you’re satisfied.” Li Ping looked at the time on his wrist and said, “Is there any problem? If not, I’ll leave first. I have to go style the others.”

“No problem, go on with your work.”

“Alright.”

After speaking with Li Ping, the director smiled and walked towards Qiao Mianmian. He then said to a crew member beside him, “You can take Qiao Mianmian for the photoshoot.”

…

The photoshoots for the main cast were quickly taken. After they were done, the official Weibo account of “Phoenix in Flight” posted the finished products.

They were posted one after another.

First the male and female lead, then the second female lead and the second male lead.

“Wow, so elegant.”

“Sister Fei looks so domineering. She’s like a queen!”

“Brother Jin looks good, too. He looks like a hero.”

“Just by looking at the photos, I can tell that the quality of this movie is going to be very high. This outfit is very textured, as expected from Li Ping!”

The few photos were well-received by the netizens.

They couldn’t wait to watch the movie.

The second male lead was a popular new actor. He had just become popular and had a lot of fans.

The comment section was filled with “I can do it”. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

After the second male lead’s photo, the official account showed Qiao Mianmian’s photo.

Qiao Mianmian was wearing a long red dress and standing in the white snow. She was holding a long sword and looking coldly in a certain direction. In less than a minute, the comments had already exceeded 10,000..
