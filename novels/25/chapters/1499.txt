Chapter 1501: How Much Sales Can a Newbie Bring?

As an A-list actress, Qiao Anxin’s endorsement sales couldn’t even compare to a newbie.

“She definitely did.” Song Fang was also stunned. “If she didn’t, she wouldn’t have such results.”

“Then, what should we do now?” Qiao Anxin’s face was pale. “I can’t lose to this slut. Xue Shiya still has many first-tier products. If my sales this time are good, I’ll have a chance to get those first-tier endorsements.

“But if I lose to this slut, they definitely won’t give me a better endorsement.”

Song Fang didn’t look too good.

Qiao Anxin was an artiste under her management, and the quality of resources in the future had something to do with her. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

She naturally hoped that Qiao Anxin would get better.

“Since she’s doing it, we’ll do it too.” Song Fang gritted her teeth. “You’re right, you can’t lose to her. I’ll arrange it now.”

...

When Qiao Mianmian’s sales reached 10,000, Qiao Anxin’s sales were only at 5,000.

Some netizens were still discussing this on Weibo, wondering if Qiao Mianmian was spamming.

But soon, a so-called expert took out the data and analyzed it. In the end, they concluded that Qiao Mianmian’s sales were all real.

The netizens felt that Qiao Anxin had lost to Qiao Mianmian.

A first-tier actress who had debuted for a few years couldn’t compare to a newbie.

Without Star Splendor, no one would support her anymore. Her true strength would be revealed.

Not long after that, some sharp-eyed netizens realized that Qiao Anxin’s sales suddenly rose very quickly. In less than half an hour, she had caught up to Qiao Mianmian.

After a while, Qiao Anxin’s sales surpassed Qiao Mianmian’s.

“I realized that Qiao Anxin’s sales have increased a lot in a short period of time. She was always behind Qiao Mianmian, but now she has surpassed her. Is she paying the bill?”

“What do you mean by paying the bill? Many of Qiao Anxin’s fans only found out about this now. Her fans are many times more than Qiao Mianmian’s fans. In terms of fans’ purchasing power, Qiao Anxin’s far better than her. I still think she’s the one paying the bill. Is it normal for a newbie’s sales to be higher than a top-tier actress?”

“I’m Sister Anxin’s fan. I just found out that Sister Anxin’s endorsement mask is online. I just bought ten boxes to support her.”

“I only found out about this too. I also bought ten boxes to support her.”

All of a sudden, Qiao Anxin’s fans came forward to support her.

This meant that Qiao Anxin didn’t pay the bill.

The questions from the passersby were quickly drowned out by the fans’ comments.

Qiao Anxin’s facial mask sales were still increasing.

At first, Qiao Mianmian’s sales were double Qiao Anxin’s. An hour later, Qiao Anxin’s sales were double Qiao Mianmian’s.

Mo Yesi had asked Wei Zheng to keep an eye on this matter, so when Wei Zheng saw that Qiao Anxin’s sales were increasing rapidly, he immediately reported this abnormality to Mo Yesi.

Xue Shiya’s Sales Department.

The computer screen recorded Qiao Anxin’s and Qiao Mianmian’s sales.

Seeing that Qiao Anxin quickly surpassed Qiao Mianmian’s sales figure by half, the woman who signed Qiao Anxin was elated. She said to Zhang Yue, “I didn’t approve of you signing a newbie back then. You can use so many artistes, how much sales can a newbie bring?”
