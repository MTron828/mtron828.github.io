Chapter 485: These Words Triggered Him

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

It was the first time that he didn’t have breakfast with Young Madam.

Lei En instinctively knew that something was amiss. Initially, he felt that Young Madam did something wrong.

Young Master wasn’t someone that would openly express his feelings. The only one that could cause him to behave this way was Young Madam.

But the weird thing was that Young Madam didn’t behave as though something happened between them.

Hence, what was wrong with the Young Master?

Who made him angry?

...

In the study room.

Mo Yesi was searching on how women would feel if their partners suffered from premature ejaculation on the web.

Very soon, he managed to find quite a few answers.

He clicked on a few of them, and his heart sank.

One netizen said, “A man must fulfill his sexual duties no matter what. He must never suffer from premature ejaculation, or his woman will despise him for sure.”

Another netizen also commented, “A man with bad sexual performance will easily be two-timed. If you can’t satisfy your woman, other men will have to do it for you.”

Another netizen continued, “Let me give my opinion. I’m a girl. My previous boyfriend suffered from premature ejaculation. To be frank, doing it with him wasn’t an enjoyable experience. It actually caused me to be traumatized about doing it. Hence, he became my ex-boyfriend. Thankfully, I met my current boyfriend. He’s really good in bed and can satisfy me every time we do it. Essentially, your sex life will affect your relationship.”

Mo Yesi stared at the two last answers for a long time.

Two-timed...

Previous boyfriend...

These words stuck out like an eyesore.

Essentially, if the woman felt that the man was incapable of satisfying her, she would look for other men?

And would break up the relationship?

They were already married. The only way that Qiao Mianmian could change his identity to an ex would be to divorce him.

Mo Yesi’s face sank as he thought that Qiao Mianmian would divorce him over this matter and look for other men. He shut off the laptop in dismay.

No, she belonged to him.

He would never allow her to look for other guys.

He would satisfy her.

He would satisfy her no matter what.

Mo Yesi couldn’t care less about his reputation as he thought of the possibility of losing Qiao Mianmian. He immediately picked up the phone and called Yan Shaoqing.

The phone rang for quite a while before being picked up. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

A raspy, lazy voice answered, “Second Bro, why are you looking for me?”

Mo Yesi bit on his lip and gripped a fountain pen tightly.

Mo Yesi fell silent for too long, and Yan Shaoqing became puzzled. He then continued, “Second Bro, are you there? Why are you not replying?”

“How long do you last when you do it with girls?” Mo Yesi finally asked after a while.

However, what answered his question was a violent coughing fit.

Yan Shaoqing seemed to have choked on something, and his cough lasted for a while.

He then asked with hurried breathing, “Second Bro, what’s wrong? Why are you asking this kind of thing? Could it be... you didn’t last long when you did it with Sis-in-law, and she despised you for it?”

Yan Shaoqing was joking.

But what he didn’t know was that Mo Yesi’s face darkened even more after he heard that.
