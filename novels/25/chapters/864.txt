Chapter 865: There’s No One Mo Nan Can’t Fame

Qiao Mianmian also tried to curry favor. “Senior Mo, I’m really very, very honored to be able to work with a music master like you. I can’t believe that I have such good luck. I’ll definitely do my best to perform well and not let you and Brother Bai down.”

Mo Nan turned to look at her. His expression was calm, but his heart was still a little agitated. “I’ll also try my best to show your best standards so that every song of yours will remain in the best state. Mianmian, let’s make this album together. I believe our future cooperation will definitely be pleasant.

“But there are some things I have to say first. In private, work is work. I might not be an easy person to talk to at work. If you make me unhappy, I might say something unpleasant.

“If you find it unacceptable...”

“I can accept it!”

Before Mo Nan could finish, Qiao Mianmian said, “If I perform badly and make you unhappy, please criticize me.”

In any case, even a diva like Sun Fei had been scolded by him.

She was... fearless.

There probably wasn’t anyone who hadn’t been scolded when they sang Mo Nan’s songs.

“Alright. When you have time, we’ll start recording the CD.”

...

Qiao Mianmian still felt like she was dreaming when she left the Mo family home.

Just like before she came, it still felt unreal.

She still couldn’t believe that she could sing Mo Nan’s song.

The name Mo Nan was associated with a bunch of superstars.

She was just a newbie...

How could she work with Mo Nan?

At the red light, Bai Yusheng turned to look at her. Seeing her dazed and confused expression, he couldn’t help but smile. “What are you thinking about? Your scenes are mainly focused on the first half of the month. The next half a month will be much easier.

“When the time comes, you can take the time to record the album.

“Mo Nan is the most professional musician. You don’t have to worry, he’ll teach you everything you don’t know.”

When Qiao Mianmian heard his voice, she blinked and slowly turned to look at him. Her voice was a little dazed too. “Brother Bai, can I really sing Mo Nan’s song? Tell me, am I dreaming?” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Of course not.” Bai Yusheng could understand how she was feeling. Seeing how she was looking at him blankly, he found it adorable and couldn’t help but pat her on the head. “You’re very lucky to be the last partner in Mo Nan’s retreat.

“I’ve known him for almost five years, and this is indeed the most time-consuming and hardworking album he has ever produced. I have a feeling that you can make it big with this album.

“There’s no one Mo Nan can’t groom.”

“Retreat?” Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

“That’s right. After this album, he’ll announce his withdrawal from the industry. He’s old now, it’s time to give himself a break.”

“I feel so pressured all of a sudden.” Qiao Mianmian bit her lip and frowned slightly. “Then, this is his last show. If I don’t perform well...”

“No.” Bai Yusheng said gently, “You have to trust yourself and him. Mo Nan told me just now that he was very satisfied with your voice. He even said that I brought him a huge surprise.”
