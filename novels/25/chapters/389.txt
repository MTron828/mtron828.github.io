Qiao Mianmian nodded.

She still felt thirsty.

Mo Yesi filled the entire glass again, and only after finishing it did Qiao Mianmian feel less thirsty.

“Are you still thirsty?” Mo Yesi sat beside her and asked.

She shook her head.

He patted her on the head and said quietly, “Go to sleep, then.”

Qiao Mianmian was sleepy.

It was only four in the morning. If she hadn’t woken up from the thirst, she would’ve slept till eight or nine in the morning.

She lay back down but saw that he was still sitting upright with no intention of sleeping again. “What about you?”

Mo Yesi rubbed his temple. “I’m not tired yet. I’ll watch you sleep first.”

“Oh. Alright, then...”

Qiao Mianmian wanted to catch some sleep before she had to wake up early in the morning.

She usually fell asleep quite quickly.

This time wasn’t any different.

As he heard her slow and steady breathing, Mo Yesi started to think about his dream again.

He thought he’d never have that nightmare again.

The past few times he slept with Qiao Mianmian, it didn’t happen.

But tonight...

He dreamt about what had happened in his childhood once again.

But it was also different from the past.

Previously, he would always be caught in the cycle in his dreamscape—watching the scene in which the policeman passed away over and over.

Until Lei En knocked on his door in the morning.

But this time, he managed to snap out of it a lot sooner.

Moreover, even before he opened his eyes, the image was already blurring when he heard Qiao Mianmian’s voice.

He had no idea what that meant.

He had to ask Lu Rao the next day.

...

Qiao Mianmian got up early the next day as she had to attend school.

When she woke up, she heard the sounds of running water from the washroom. Soon after, Mo Yesi walked out in his bathrobe.

He had the habit of showering in the morning.

The bathrobe was wrapped loosely around him, and his slightly damp chest could be seen.

Droplets were also rolling down his handsome face and about his sexy lips.

Being greeted with such a captivating scene in the morning was undeniably tempting for Qiao Mianmian.

She felt that... her husband was too handsome.

Mo Yesi saw how she was staring at his chest without blinking. His lips curled up, and he strode towards her.

A refreshing after-bath scent gushed at her. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The man wrapped her in an embrace the moment he got to her.

He kissed her on the top of her head and said alluringly, “Good morning, Baby. I’ve prepared your toothbrush, toothpaste, and the warm water as well. Get yourself washed up.”

Qiao Mianmian was a little stunned. “How did you know I’d be getting up at this time?”

He chuckled. “Aren’t you going to school today? You used to wake up at this time, so I guessed your alarm was set at the same time today.”

Qiao Mianmian looked up at him, a little surprised.

“What is it?” Mo Yesi ruffled her hair gently.

“Nothing much. I’ll go wash up.”

Qiao Mianmian walked to the washroom.

She was surprised by Mo Yesi’s thoughtfulness.

This man had surprised her with his care and concern several times.

It seemed like it really took time to know someone.

What one seemed like at first glance wasn’t always their true self.
