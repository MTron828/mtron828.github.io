Chapter 1107: Don’t You Think You’re Too Biased?

Mo Yesi stayed for another hour before leaving with Qiao Mianmian and Qiao Chen.

Even after they left, Madam Mo, who claimed to be unwell, still did not appear.

After they left, the Old Madam asked the maid to call Madam Mo down.

“Tell Madam that I’m looking for her. I don’t care how uncomfortable she is, she has to come down.”

Soon, the maid called Madam Mo downstairs.

“Mom, are you looking for me?” Madam Mo came down from upstairs. When she saw the stern-faced old lady sitting in the living room, she immediately felt a little scared and slowly walked up to her.

The old lady did not say anything and only sneered. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Madam Mo’s expression changed instantly.

She asked cautiously, “Mom, is something the matter?”

The old lady raised her head and glanced at her. Her eyes were also cold. She opened her mouth and said in an even colder voice, “Don’t you know why I’m looking for you? Shangguan Wenpei, you’re already so old, yet you’re still angry with your son and daughter-in-law. It wasn’t easy for them to return home, but you’re making a face. Do you want them to never come back?

“What you did today, do you look like an elder?

“What do you want others to think of the Mo Family? Let me tell you, I know what you are thinking. But listen carefully, I don’t care what you think, you have to dispel these thoughts.

“Ah Si is already married, and I’m very satisfied with Mianmian. If you dare to cause trouble for me and ruin my grandson and granddaughter-in-law’s marriage, I won’t let you off!”

Madam Mo’s expression changed, looking aggrieved.

Seeing her like this, the old lady sneered again. “What, you still feel aggrieved? You think I’ve let you suffer?”

Old Madam had never been satisfied with this daughter-in-law.

But because of her son, even if she wasn’t very satisfied, she didn’t do anything to make things difficult for Madam Mo.

She thought that no matter how unhappy Madam Mo was with Qiao Mianmian, she would at least feel the same way.

She would also step back because of her son.

But clearly, she was wrong.

Her daughter-in-law was not as sensible as she thought.

The Old Madam would no longer be polite to her.

She hated it the most when her family was embroiled in dirty affairs and affected a good family.

And Madam Mo was doing what she hated the most.

Madam Mo bit her lip and looked at the Old Madam with reddened eyes. She thought about Old Madam’s attitude towards Qiao Mianmian and Old Madam’s attitude towards her.

She could no longer hold the grievances accumulated in her heart.

“You’re biased, Mom,” she called out, aggrieved.

Madam Mo was also a woman spoiled by her husband. Even in front of her mother-in-law, she couldn’t help but cry. “How long has Qiao Mianmian been married to Ah Si? You’ve only seen her a few times, but you’re still speaking up for her.

“Everything she does is right. Everything I do is wrong.

“You’re satisfied with her in every way, but you’re not satisfied with me in any way.

“Mom, don’t you think you’re being too biased? What’s so good about her that you’re so satisfied with her? Isn’t she just a little sweet with her words and knows how to coax people? But what kind of words from a person like her are sincere? You’re really good to her, but do you think she treats you the same?”
