𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Do you know that you’ve been deceived by her? She’s a scheming woman who’s been coaxing you and Ah Si.

“It’s not just her now, there’s also her younger brother.” As Madam Mo spoke, she gritted her teeth in hatred. “Both of them don’t have good intentions and each of them is sweet-talking. Old Madam, you’re such a smart person, can’t you tell?”

After hearing what she said, the old lady’s face darkened. “So, that’s what you’re thinking. You think I’m biased. But, have you thought about it? All the things you’ve done recently, which one of them was right?

“You want to break up Ah Si’s marriage all day long, and you still want me to be nice to you?

“Is there a mother like you? You don’t wish for your son to have a good life, but you think about how to make him unhappy all day long. Tell me, how can I be satisfied with you? You want my grandson to have a bad life, and you want me to give you a good face?”

Madam Mo had always been afraid of the Old Madam.

She didn’t dare to talk back to the old lady.

However, she was also furious today and felt especially aggrieved. She couldn’t help but rebuke the Old Madam. “Letting Ah Si continue to be with Qiao Mianmian is what makes him unhappy. I just want him to be good and happy. I don’t want my precious son to be ruined by that materialistic woman.

“Mom, you were blinded by Qiao Mianmian and don’t know what she’s really like. If you know, you definitely wouldn’t want Ah Si to continue being with her.”

“Oh, so you know what she’s really like? Tell me, then. What is she like?” the elderly lady asked coldly.

Madam Mo immediately became excited. “She’s a materialistic woman. I’ve never seen anyone more materialistic than her.”

She knew that the Old Madam wouldn’t believe her, so she immediately told her everything about the negotiation with Qiao Mianmian.

She was so agitated and angry that she did not notice that the old lady’s expression was getting worse.

“Mom, don’t you think she’s very materialistic? She actually asked for all of our Mo Corporation’s shares. I’ve never seen such a black-hearted woman. She even said that she would divorce Ah Si immediately if I agreed to her conditions.

“Do you still think she’s true to Ah Si?

“She only got together with Ah Si because of his money. How can we let such a snobbish woman stay by his side?

“I won’t let such a woman continue being my daughter-in-law. Even if you and Ah Si have something against me, I want to be the villain this time.”

Madam Mo did not hear any response from the Old Madam.

She lowered her head in confusion.

When she saw the Old Madam’s angry expression, she thought that she was angry because she knew Qiao Mianmian’s true identity.

She couldn’t help but look happy.

Qiao Mianmian was only so fearless because of her son and grandmother’s love.

If she lost the Old Madam’s favor...

The more she thought about it, the happier she became. She couldn’t hide the smile on her face.

“Mom, you know her true colors now, right? How can a woman like her be worthy of our Ah Si? No wonder marriage has always been about being well-matched in terms of social status. This isn’t a marriage of equal social status. It’s really not possible.”
