Qiao Mianmian thought about his stingy actions and was very suspicious. [Your skills are soaring? Are you sure? It can’t be another fierce operation with a score of 0-5-0.]

Master Zhan: [You can doubt my personality, but you can’t doubt my skills. Come, come, come online now. Let me show you what high-end operations are!]

Qiao Mianmian ignored him and replied casually. She then sent Linda a WeChat message asking her to send her some details about “My Intern Parents”.

She learned from her that this variety show didn’t have a script.

It was different from before.

It was much easier to record a variety show with a script.

Without a script, they had to perform on their own.

It was easy to expose an artiste’s true self.

This situation was both good and bad.

On the good side, some artistes could rely on their true personalities to gain points.

The bad side was that some artistes would ruin themselves.

Qiao Mianmian knew that an artiste with a good reputation had lost a lot of fans after going on the show. He even lost some good resources.

Hence, the netizens called this variety show the “demon mirror.”

…

When Mo Yesi returned from work, Qiao Mianmian told him that she was going to appear in “My Intern Parents” in a few days.

Mo Yesi agreed to let her join the variety show after finding out that “My Intern Parents” was a parent-child variety show.

“When are you going? I’ll get Wei Zheng to empty the schedule for that day. I’ll send you there.”

“You don’t have to send me. It’s just a three-hour drive. And…”

“And what?” Mo Yesi changed into a gray casual outfit and walked out of the changing room. He walked behind Qiao Mianmian and pulled her into his arms. “It’s not too far, so it’s convenient for me to send you there.

“You can also take a look at the environment for the recording. If it’s similar to the place you went to last time, then don’t record it. Come back with me directly.”

Mo Yesi frowned when he thought of the small village Qiao Mianmian went to previously.

He would never let her go to such a remote place again.

“It isn’t in a village. It’ll be recorded in C City.” Qiao Mianmian was also traumatized by the mountain village she’d been to previously, so she specially asked Linda where the show was being filmed. She wouldn’t dare to go if it was a remote place.

She didn’t want Mo Yesi to send her to C City because the way they filmed this show was different.

Previously, they had recorded a portion of it before editing it and broadcasting it.

And this time, it would be a live stream on Weibo.

The other artistes would go on their own. If Mo Yesi sent her, the netizens would definitely say that they were showing off their affection.

She should keep a low profile.

Moreover, she felt that with Mo Yesi’s personality, he definitely wouldn’t like to be filmed.

“Then, why don’t you let me send you?” Mo Yesi lowered his head and smelled the fragrance in her hair. “I was afraid that others would know about our relationship before. What’s there to be afraid of now?”

“Because…”

Qiao Mianmian was about to tell him the reason when she felt a warm breath by her ear. The man’s low voice became a little hoarse.. His warm lips were almost against her earlobe as he whispered, “You showered? You smell so good.”
