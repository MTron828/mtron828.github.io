Chapter 930: Sleep After Exercising

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but shudder when the man’s warm and moist lips touched hers. She asked, “W-What reward do you want?”

“Mm, let me think...”

Mo Yesi kissed her on the lips and bit it.

He seemed to treat her lips as a delicacy. After tasting it several times, he murmured hoarsely, “I want you. Can I?”

Qiao Mianmian was already dizzy from his kiss. She only snapped back to her senses when she felt his hand enter her collar.

She held him down. “Mm... Mo Yesi, no...”

“Call me Hubby.”

The man held her hand and kissed her again. “Why not? I’ve calculated the time. Your Aunt Flo isn’t here yet.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

He actually remembered her period?

She didn’t even remember much about it.

Qiao Mianmian had a strange feeling when she thought about how this man remembered her period just to do that with her.

Wasn’t he the male god of abstinence?

Wasn’t he a man of few desires?

This man in front of her, who was thinking about doing it with her every day, how was he pure and simple?

He always looked as if he wanted to eat her up. It had nothing to do with “pure and innocent”.

“But, I want to rest early...” Qiao Mianmian trembled in his arms at the thought of his terrifying stamina.

“Then, let’s just do it once.” The man kissed her and said in a low voice, “It’s still early, there’s still time. It’s best to sleep after exercising.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

How was it suitable! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

He always said that he would only do it once.

But when had he ever done what he said?

He was a liar.

She wouldn’t be so foolish as to believe him.

“Hubby, I’m not feeling well today. I want to sleep early. Can we do it another day...” She tugged at the man’s arm and said coquettishly.

She thought that this would soften his heart, but little did she know that in the eyes of men, she looked like a criminal.

Mo Yesi couldn’t stand it when she called him Hubby.

The man’s eyes burned as he turned around and pinned her down. He kissed her cheeks one after another. “Baby, proper exercise is good for sleep. Just once, I promise it’ll only be once today.”

...

In the end, Qiao Mianmian’s protest was futile.

It was a good thing that Mo Yesi kept his word this time. Since he said it once, he only wanted her once.

But it was a long time this time...

And it was full of tricks.

Even though it was only once, Qiao Mianmian was still exhausted after the incident. Mo Yesi even carried her to the shower.

It wasn’t the first time he did it, so there was nothing to be shy about.

Moreover, she was already too sleepy to open her eyes during the shower. She fell asleep before he even finished showering.

She slept all the way to the next day.

When she opened her eyes, Mo Yesi was already gone.

Qiao Mianmian rubbed her eyes and got out of bed. She was about to call Mo Yesi when she heard the door open.
