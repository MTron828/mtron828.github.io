Chapter 38: Don’t You Think You Have Failed?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Until now, the swelling on her face had not completely gone down.

In a few days, she would have to film with the crew, so she couldn’t hurt her face anymore.

Qiao Mianmian was 1.68 meters tall, a lot taller than Qiao Anxin, who was only 1.63 meters.

When she looked down at Qiao Anxin, the coldness in her eyes scared Qiao Anxin, who took two steps back.

Looking at the shrinking Qiao Anxin, Qiao Mianmian raised her chin and said coldly, “Qiao Anxin, you seem to have a hobby of collecting rubbish. Don’t think that everyone else is like you. It’s just a man I don’t want anymore, yet you picked him up so elatedly. Are you so happy and proud of that?

“In the past, in order to snatch resources, you changed rich partners one after another and finally managed to climb to where you are today. Now, you’ve forgotten your past hurt, but you’ve also forgotten about those events? If I had such thinking as well, do you think Qiao Anxin would still be a thing?

“Sugar daddies?” At this, Qiao Mianmian’s eyes showed disdain and her eyes were full of pride. “That’s your hobby, not mine.”

“Qiao Mianmian, you...”

Qiao Anxin’s face darkened. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Her weak and hypocritical disguise was finally ripped off.

She bit her lip tightly and resentfully said, “Do you know what I hate most about you? It’s your self-righteousness and arrogance! What are you supporting yourself with, it doesn’t matter how long you and Brother Ah Ze have known each other, it doesn’t matter how deep your relationship is.

“He loves me now!

“Qiao Mianmian, you can’t even tie down the heart of your man, don’t you think you’re such a failure?”

Qiao Anxin’s heart hissed with hatred and her eyes were filled with resentment.

She really hated Qiao Mianmian!

She had hated him since young.

As long as Qiao Mianmian was there, her spotlight would be taken away.

Qiao Mianmian’s face was really annoying. Any man who looked at her would be enchanted.

It took her five years to snatch Su Ze over.

But even so, she dare not take it lightly now.

Because she could feel that Su Ze still had feelings for Qiao Mianmian.

If it hadn’t been for her pregnancy and for her revealing her relationship with Su Ze to Qiao Mianmian, how could Su Ze have broken their engagement?

Moreover, the breaking of the engagement had even been initiated by Qiao Mianmian.

Thinking of this, Qiao Anxin was even more resentful. Her eyes were full of jealousy as she said, “Qiao Mianmian, let me tell you, I will not only steal your man, but I will also take everything you care about. Don’t you like acting? As long as I’m in the entertainment world, don’t even think about having a chance to be popular.”

Looking at her frantic appearance, Qiao Mianmian just smirked, her face indifferent. “Qiao Anxin, you really think you’re so big and powerful? You think you have the final say?”

Qiao Anxin was so arrogant, but wasn’t she relying only on Su Ze?

If she had to fight backstage, why should she be afraid?

In her ear, she could suddenly hear Mo Yesi’s words. “Marry me, and you can do whatever you want. I will take responsibility for everything.”

All of a sudden, her heart settled.

That man...

Even if she didn’t know him too well, she knew that he wasn’t someone who would make empty promises.

With his promise, she wasn’t afraid of anything.
