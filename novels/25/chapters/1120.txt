Chapter 1121: Abortion in High School

Some even said that Qiao Anxin terminated her contract with Starlight because the president of Starlight had done something wrong to her.

She had only proposed to terminate the contract after she was disheartened.

Because of this matter, someone quickly dug up the matter of Su Ze kneeling on the street and begging Qiao Mianmian to get back together.

Fans started speaking up for Qiao Anxin—

“When her boyfriend publicly begged his ex-girlfriend to get back together, did he ever think about Anxin’s feelings? It was Su Ze who let down Anxin first. Anxin was just disheartened and decided to leave Starlight. Let me ask you. If your boyfriend (girlfriend) did something that let you down and did not care about your feelings at all, would you not mind? Anxin leaving Starlight was the best choice. If she pretended that nothing happened and continued to stay with Starlight and that man, we fans would be disappointed.”

“That’s right, that’s right. What right did Anxin have to say that she didn’t do the right thing? She did the right thing, alright? There was no need to talk about friendship with a betrayer. She should have left Starlight a long time ago!”

“Although Su Ze is a scumbag, doesn’t anyone think that Qiao Mianmian is a b*tch as well? She had already broken up with her ex-boyfriend, yet she still lingered around. I don’t believe that Su Ze would do something like that on the streets if she didn’t hint at it.”

“Upstairs+1, I also feel that if the female party didn’t give a hint, the male party wouldn’t have been so high-profile as to seek reconciliation on the streets. In summary, the female party is a real bitch, but she pretended to be a victim and completely removed all responsibility. She’s also very impressive.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“It’s not that she’s powerful, it’s just that her sugar daddy is powerful. Have you all forgotten who stood up for her to settle that matter? Actually, I think everyone knows what kind of person she is. It’s just that they don’t dare to offend her because of her power.”

“The person upstairs is talking about the Gong family’s young master? Let me tell you, those rumors about her and Young Master Gong are all true. A friend of mine told me that she saw Su Ze and Qiao Mianmian pulling each other on the streets that day and Young Master Gong saw it. Young Master Gong was especially angry and even beat Su Ze up. Qiao Mianmian is really amazing. She’s hanging her ex-boyfriend on one side and hugging a golden thigh on the other. Tsk tsk, looks are justice these days. With a pretty face, you can really make a living.”

“Qiao Mianmian is a vixen, a green tea b*tch. Not only is she hanging onto Gong Zeli and Su Ze, but she’s also hanging onto Bai Yusheng. Otherwise, how could she be the female lead of Bai Yusheng’s new drama? She’s a newcomer without any works, how could she get the role of the female lead?”

“Qiao Mianmian is really disgusting. She looks pure and innocent, but she must have slept with many men in private. One of my sister’s friends used to be in the same school as her, and she said that she used to seduce men everywhere and had a messy private life.”

“A friend of mine used to be in the same school as Qiao Mianmian. She said that she had an abortion in high school, and it wasn’t just once. Because the abortion was done by my friend’s mother, it’s definitely true.”
