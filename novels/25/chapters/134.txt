He was still single with no prior experience of being in a relationship. He couldn’t help but blush too.

He looked at the time. It was only 11. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Chairman Mo was into those activities... so early in the night.

It really was the honeymoon period of newlyweds.

Then again, it was understandable.

If he had a petite and beautiful woman like Young Madam as his wife, he wouldn’t be able to hold back too!

Qiao Mianmian received the bags of clothes and saw Wei Zheng’s strange expression.

She didn’t know what to say.

She didn’t have to ask to know that Wei Zheng had misunderstood!

He was definitely thinking the same way that Young Master Yan did!

But she hadn’t done anything at all!

...

10 minutes later.

The sound of running water stopped.

Qiao Mianmian was hanging his clothes in the wardrobe and was about to take another piece when she heard him say, “Mo Yesi, come over.”

The man’s voice was very alluring, to begin with.

But with the steam in the bathroom making his voice hoarser, she found it even harder to resist.

Qiao Mianmian thought he wanted his clothes after his shower, so she got an outfit for him and walked towards the bathroom.

She reached out and knocked on the door. “Mo Yesi, open the door for a bit. I’ll hand you the clothes.”

With that, the bathroom door was opened.

Clouds of warm water vapor rushed out.

Qiao Mianmian did not want to look in since he had just finished showering and was unclothed. She turned away and said a little nervously, “Your clothes are right here. Hurry and change into them.”

Through the gap in the door, he said, “What are you afraid of, I’m not going to eat you up.”

She felt a grip tighten around her wrist. The man had pulled her into the bathroom.

Qiao Mianmian shrieked in shock.

The next moment, she was in the bathroom, leaning against his sturdy chest.

It was warm in there.

The man had just finished showering and the scent of body soap lingered on him.

It was extremely... bewitching.

She wasn’t sure if it was the high temperature in the bathroom or the sudden pull, but Qiao Mianmian felt a little giddy.

The man’s heart was pumping quickly.

Qiao Mianmian had one side of her face against his chest and could hear his heart rate. Hers picked up speed too along with his.

Mo Yesi wrapped one arm around her waist and locked her in an embrace. He then tipped her chin up and looked deeply into her eyes. “Baby, you look nervous. What are you afraid of?”

Her body had tensed up in his arms.

She still had her hand against his chest, almost as a defensive measure. Her eyes were widened, looking at him cautiously.

She looked like an afraid kitten.

She probably had no idea how adorable she looked.

So adorable... that he wanted to bully her.

Just like when she was crying the other night.

On second thought, he felt like his attitude towards her was a little warped.

But he simply couldn’t control himself.
