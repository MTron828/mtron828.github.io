Chapter 402: Do You Have the Time to Meet Now?

“I don’t think that it will affect me that much...” Qiao Mianmian thought for a moment before replying smilingly. “I don’t think that my luck is so bad. Weren’t you the one who said that my luck became better ever since I met Mo Yesi?

“I don’t believe I will be unlucky ever again.”

“Ok...” Jiang Luoli shrugged. “I hope so, too.”

“Oh, right. Baby, the studio hasn’t informed you of the contracting signing?”

Even though it was Bai Yusheng’s informal decision that Qiao Mianmian was named the third female lead on the spot, they weren’t expecting any changes to it.

But as long no contracts were signed, nothing was guaranteed.

Qiao Mianmian shook her head. “Not yet.”

“Let’s wait for a while more, then. They should call you by the end of today. Do you want me to ask Big Brother Bai?”

“No need for that. I’ll just wait to hear from them.”

As soon as she finished the sentence, her phone rang.

She fished out her phone. Thinking that it was from the studio, she picked up anxiously. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

She took a deep breath and tried to sound as calm as possible. “Hi, this is Qiao Mianmian.”

“Hi, Miss Qiao. I’m Linda, one of the managers from Star Splendor. Do you have the time to meet now?”

Qiao Mianmian was shocked. “You’re Xie Linda?”

Hearing the name, Jiang Luoli was shocked as well.

“Yes. I hope to discuss something with you. Can we meet up to chat?”

Qiao Mianmian frowned and went silent.

She turned to look at Jiang Luoli with a puzzled look.

Wasn’t Xie Linda Qiao Anxin’s manager?

Why was she calling?

Linda also went silent for a while before continuing, “If Miss Qiao isn’t free to leave the school, I can come over to find you. Just let me know when you’re available.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

After a while, she hung up the phone.

Jiang Luoli immediately asked, “Did Qiao Anxin’s manager just call you?”

“Yes.” Qiao Mianmian replied, still puzzled.

She was puzzled over why Xie Linda called. What does she want?

“Why did she call you?”

“I’m not sure. She said that she wants to meet me to discuss some things.”

Jiang Luoli replied, “What does she have to discuss with you about? She must be aware of the bad relationship between both of you.”

“That’s right. I’m curious as well,” Qiao Mianmian replied as she looked at the phone. “I’ve agreed to meet up with her.”

“You agreed to meet her?”

“Yes.”

“Let me go, instead. Aren’t you afraid that it could be a trap set up by her and Qiao Anxin?”

Qiao Mianmian thought for a while, shook her head, and replied, “I don’t think so. She sounded quite sincere. It seems like she really has something important to discuss with me. I’ve arranged to meet her at the coffee shop outside of school. She wouldn’t dare to do anything on our turf.”

Jiang Luoli was still worried that something was wrong.

Why would Qiao Anxin’s manager call her?

They must have some bad intentions.

“Let me accompany you, then.” Jiang Luoli suggested after thinking for a moment. “I’ll be worried if you go alone. I’m also curious about what Xie Linda wants to discuss with you.”

...

Half an hour later.

At the coffee shop outside of the Yuncheng City Film Academy.

When they arrived, they saw that Linda was already sitting at a discrete corner of the store.
