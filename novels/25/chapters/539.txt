Chapter 540: Miss Shen, What Are You Doing Here?

Wei Zheng was actually at the lobby waiting for Qiao Mianmian.

But he didn’t expect Shen Rou to arrive first.

He was taken aback to see her. “Miss Shen, what are you doing here?”

Shen Rou’s joy faded.

She understood what he was saying.

Wei Zheng evidently wasn’t there to receive her.

He... didn’t even know she was coming.

Shen Rou had sent Mo Yesi a message before arriving, but he said that he was too busy to meet her.

But she came, anyway.

When she saw Wei Zheng, she thought that Mo Yesi was just claiming to be busy, but actually still welcomed her arrival. He even got Wei Zheng to come down and receive her!

But she was proven wrong very quickly. This was rather embarrassing.

But as the First Miss of the Shen family, she had to maintain her elegance at all times. She recovered a smile soon enough and said, “I’m here to see Ah Si. Is he busy now?”

Shen Rou had come to the Mo Corporation before.

Back then, Mo Yesi wasn’t the Chairman yet. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

And she was the only woman to ever be seen around him.

Wei Zheng knew that the Shen and Mo families were on good terms, and Shen Rou was rather close to Mo Yesi too. He didn’t find it strange for her to be looking for Mo Yesi.

He nodded. “Chairman Mo is in a meeting. Does Miss Shen have something important to talk to Chairman Mo about?”

“It’s nothing much.” Shen Rou bit her lip and furrowed her brows a little. She seemed rather bothered by something and kept quiet for a moment before letting out a sigh. “I had some misunderstanding with Ah Si a while ago, and he’s still angry with me. I felt there’s a need to talk to him in person, so here I am.

“Since he’s in a meeting, I’ll wait for him in his office.”

Wei Zheng was just about to nod and take her upstairs when he suddenly recalled that he hadn’t received Qiao Mianmian yet.

“Uh, Miss Shen.” He glanced at his watch, and then at the entrance. He then said apologetically, “Why don’t you come another day? Chairman Mo is very busy today, he won’t have time for the rest of the afternoon.

“If Miss Shen wants to wait for him, it’ll be a very long wait.”

Wei Zheng knew that Qiao Mianmian was coming.

It wouldn’t be nice for Shen Rou to be sitting in Mo Yesi’s office.

Although Miss Shen and Chairman Mo were just friends, she was once the only woman who could get close to him, after all. Just that alone was something that Young Madam might take an issue with.

Women were all petty.

Moreover, he’d been by Chairman Mo’s side for several years.

He was sure that Chairman Mo simply treated Miss Shen as a friend.

But on Miss Shen’s end... it might not be the case.

Women were hard to read.

If Miss Shen really had other interests in Chairman Mo, she wouldn’t be happy to see Young Madam.

What if something happened while Chairman Mo wasn’t around? What was he to do?

But who would’ve expected that his words hadn’t managed to dissuade Shen Rou?

She smiled and said, “I’ll just keep waiting, then. He’ll surely knock off today, right?”

Wei Zheng: “... Miss Shen.”
