Chapter 2624: Overwhelming Everyone

Her dress wasn’t bought on Taobao, but it was indeed very village-like. It couldn’t compare to Feibao’s elegant aura.

Weiai Feibao: “The set of jewelry she’s wearing looks so fake. It’s obviously an imitation. She’s the CEO’s wife and the daughter of a rich family. Doesn’t she even have a decent set of jewelry? It seems like this so-called wife of a rich family isn’t doing well. She’s just showing off.”

Song Fei’s brainless fans were all lying, saying that the dress wasn’t a treasure and that the jewelry was a cheap imitation.

In any case, Qiao Mianmian was belittled from head to toe.

Then, the group of them collectively fantasized for a while before unilaterally declaring that Song Fei won.

Even the passersby were speechless by Song Fei’s fans.

This was really brainless.

Qiao Mianmian’s outfit tonight was very good.

Moreover, her dress and jewelry were obviously very expensive. No layman would think that they were cheap.

Song Fei’s fans were spouting nonsense just to defame Qiao Mianmian.

Finally, someone couldn’t take it anymore. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Qiao Mianmian’s dress is one of the only two in the world. One is in the hands of a princess consort in Country M, and the other is on her. The dress she’s wearing was designed by the world’s top designer, Aaron Smith. I don’t have to explain to everyone how impressive Aaron Smith is, right? You’ll know if you search it up on Baidu. Also, the jewelry she’s wearing, if I’m not seeing wrongly, I think I saw the MR.S engraving on it, and the material is the best blue diamond. I don’t have to explain to you how rare, how precious, and how expensive a blue diamond is. What I’m not sure about is Baidu.

“I didn’t want to post this on Weibo. After all, I don’t want to provoke a brainless fan and cause trouble for myself. But I find it funny to see some brainless comments. It’s really enough to defame someone for the sake of defamation. You can donate your eyes to those who need them. If Aaron Smith and MR.S find out that their works are being called an imitation, they’ll probably be so angry they’ll vomit blood. Also, these two top designers are my idols. I posted this on Weibo because I couldn’t bear to watch some brainless fan’s actions. Secondly, I couldn’t tolerate someone insulting my idol like this.”

This Weibo user was a beauty blogger and the chief editor of a fashion magazine.

Hence, no one would doubt her veracity.

Because she couldn’t lie.

So, the dress Qiao Mianmian was wearing was really designed by Aaron Smith?

Was the jewelry she was wearing really made by MR.S?

If it was true, then Qiao Mianmian’s outfit tonight would be overwhelming.

The C brand was nothing compared to her outfit.

What was Aaron Smith’s level?

The C brand’s designers couldn’t compare.

He was a world-renowned fashion designer, and every piece of work he finished was a treasure that every country fought for..
