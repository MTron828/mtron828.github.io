Chapter 1782: Everyone Loves Beauty

Moreover, he didn’t have any hatred towards Qiao Mianmian.

If it wasn’t for Little Xiao and Song Ke, Han Yan would have taken the initiative to greet her.

Everyone loved beauty.

With such a beauty sitting there like a fairy, which man would really hate her?

He just saw that Little Xiao and Song Ke didn’t have a good relationship with Qiao Mianmian and he didn’t want to offend them.

Since Shen Fei didn’t take his seat, Han Yan sat down.

Song Ke returned to her seat angrily.

Little Xiao looked deeply at the two people in the backseat, pursed her lips, and sat back in silence.

She didn’t know what Shen Fei’s relationship with Qiao Mianmian was.

Previously, Shen Fei spoke up for Qiao Mianmian on Weibo, and now she was sitting with her.

Were they close friends?

But that was impossible.

Qiao Mianmian and Shen Fei had never interacted before. One was a newbie, while the other was a senior who had won several Best Actress awards. Moreover, from the way they interacted, they didn’t seem like long-time friends.

Could it be that Shen Fei knew who Qiao Mianmian’s backing was?

After thinking about it, Little Xiao felt that this was more likely.

...

In the backseat.

Seeing Shen Fei sitting over, Qiao Mianmian felt warm.

Whether Shen Fei really liked sitting in the last row or just said that to help her, Qiao Mianmian was grateful to her.

Thinking about how Shen Fei had spoken up for her on Weibo previously, Qiao Mianmian felt that she had to thank her in person.

“Sister Shen, thank you.”

“Mm?” Shen Fei turned around and took off her sunglasses. “What are you thanking me for?” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Mianmian smiled. “Sister Shen helped me the last time. Thank you so much.”

Shen Fei finally remembered what she was talking about.

She also smiled. “It’s nothing. I wouldn’t normally do that, but I didn’t want the junior I admire to be slandered for no reason.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

Shen Fei admired her?

Did she hear wrongly?

Shen Fei met her gaze and smiled as if she knew what she was thinking. “Although the audition was short, your performance surprised me.

“That scene wasn’t easy. I didn’t expect you to perform so well.

“As a newbie, I admire your performance. Our scriptwriter admires you, too. If you really want to, you should thank her. She played a huge part in you getting the second female lead role.

“She insisted that you play it. She said that you acted out the feeling she wanted.”

Qiao Mianmian knew about the scriptwriter.

She was indeed an impressive scriptwriter.

If she really got the second female lead role because of her, Qiao Mianmian felt that she had to thank her in person.

She was going to be filming a variety show in Ning City for a month now. She probably had to wait for the show to end before thanking her.

Everyone woke up early.

It was inevitable to be sleepy.

Shen Fei said a few words to Qiao Mianmian and then yawned. She said lazily, “I woke up early this morning. I’m so sleepy. I’ll sleep for a while. If you don’t sleep, call me when we get there.”
