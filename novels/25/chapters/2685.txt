Chapter 2687: Is She Worthy of a House Worth More Than a Billion Yuan?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Mo Shixiu didn’t care how Madam Mo felt after hearing this. He left after saying that.

This time, no matter how Madam Mo called him from behind, he didn’t stop.

…

Madam Mo returned home full of anger and resentment.

Just as she reached the living room, she heard Old Madam say happily, “Yueyue is the first child of Shixiu’s generation and my first great-grandchild. Her 100-day banquet must be grand. When the time comes, invite all the famous people in Yuncheng City to celebrate.

“Oh right, Luoli has helped the Mo family a lot. We have to reward her.

“I think the house in the east is pretty good, so I’m thinking of giving it to her as a reward. What do you think?” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The house in the east?

Having just entered the living room, Madam Mo heard this and couldn’t help but stop in her tracks. The anger in her heart rushed to her head!

That house was worth more than a billion yuan!

And she planned to give it to Jiang Luoli just like that?!

Madam Mo came from a prestigious family, rich and powerful. She naturally wouldn’t be jealous of such a thing.

Because she gave birth to Mo Shixiu and Mo Yesi, Old Madam also gave her a reward of equal value.

Hence, Old Madam wasn’t biased.

But she despised Jiang Luoli from the bottom of her heart. The Jiang family was like an ant in her eyes. She felt that Jiang Luoli wasn’t worthy of such a reward.

A poor girl who grew up in a slum.

She would definitely be happy with any reward.

Was she worthy of a house worth more than a billion yuan?

Another gentle voice sounded. It was her husband’s voice. “It’s only right. Mom, it’s fine as long as you’ve decided. I have no objections.”

“Then, let’s do it this way. I’ll get someone to settle this tomorrow. Oh right, get someone to invite Master Chen over and get him to calculate Yueyue’s name as soon as possible. Also, get someone to tidy up a nursery for the next few days. Yueyue can’t come back without a place to stay.”

“Alright.”

“Now that I’m satisfied, I have no regrets.” Old Madam said happily, “I’m just waiting for Yesi and Mianmian to give me another great-grandchild. My life will have been worth it, then.”

“Mom, you’re a blessed person. You’ll also be blessed in the future.”

“I’m not greedy. I’m satisfied now. I’ll give the extra blessings to you juniors. I don’t have much to ask for now. I’ll be happy as long as I see that our family is harmonious.”

“Yes, everything will go as you wish,” Mo Yunchen said gently.

“There’s nothing for me to worry about in the family now. The only thing I’m worried about is Wenpei.” Old Madam changed the topic and sighed. “She has too heavy a mindset about family background, that’s why she doesn’t like Luoli. If she continues to cause trouble, this family won’t have a peaceful day anymore.”

“Yunchen, persuade her not to be so stubborn. Now that the two children have fallen out with her, she should reflect on herself. How much longer does she want to continue being like this?”

“Mom, I’ll persuade her.” Mo Yunchen sighed. “She was wrong this time. It’s my fault, too. I’ve spoiled her.”

“You finally know? I’ve told you before that you can spoil your wife, but you have to have a limit. Wenpei wasn’t like this in the past.. She just became more and more insensible because of you.”
