Chapter 770: His Past Is Cleaner Than Any Man’s

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

That was true.

That jealous Mo Yesi...

It was hard for her to explain.

“But to be honest, I’ve known Mo Yesi for so many years, but this is the first time I know that he’s actually jealous and flustered because of a woman. I was shocked when he called me last night.

“I wonder if his cell phone was taken away.”

“... ”

“Really.” Bai Yusheng smiled. “You’ve never seen him like that before, right? He’s just like a monk. He looks so cold and heartless. He wouldn’t react even if a woman stripped naked in front of him, much less get jealous.

“Back then, we even suspected that he liked men.”

Qiao Mianmian burst out laughing.

“We all thought that he’d be alone for life. After all, it’s not that he doesn’t want to get married, he’s just not interested in women. You should know that he has another problem. He’s allergic to women?”

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian nodded.

She’d heard about this from Uncle Li.

She was shocked too.

She never expected someone to have such an illness.

Until now, she still found it rather strange.

She asked Bai Yusheng curiously, “Brother Bai, did he really have an allergic reaction when he touched other women?”

“Mm, he really does have an allergic reaction.” Bai Yusheng narrowed his eyes and seemed to be recalling something. His smile deepened. “We didn’t believe it before too. We thought that it was just an excuse for him to reject those women. But one time, we saw it with our own eyes and believed it.”

“Then, what is his allergy like?”

Qiao Mianmian had never seen Mo Yesi being allergic to women.

Anyway, she only knew that he wasn’t allergic to her.

She could touch any part of him.

And he... really liked to touch her.

“He vomited and had rashes all over his body. I heard that he even fainted when it was more serious. The one we saw was when he had rashes.”

“He touched another woman?” Qiao Mianmian frowned slightly.

She knew that it was all in the past, whether it was other women who touched him or the other way around.

She shouldn’t mind it.

But the thought of him touching another woman still made her uncomfortable.

She finally understood why Mo Yesi minded Su Ze so much.

If Mo Yesi also had an ex, and they’d known each other for 10 years, they’d almost be married.

She’d be bothered by it too.

No, she would definitely mind it.

“That was a special situation. We passed by a place and someone fell into the water. Ah Si went down to save that person. He’s usually so cold and doesn’t seem to care about others’ lives, but he’s actually a kind person.”

It was actually like this.

Qiao Mianmian was a little surprised.

She also felt that Mo Yesi was the sort of person who didn’t care about anyone else other than himself. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

She didn’t expect him to have saved someone before.

She felt like she understood him a little better now.

She liked it a little more.

“You don’t have to be jealous. Mo Yesi’s past can be said to be cleaner than any other man’s. Because of his weird habit, he never had a woman by his side. You’re definitely his first.”
