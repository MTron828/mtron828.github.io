Chapter 2783: Do You Have to Keep a Face?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Before drawing lots again, Li Wei introduced the rules of the show to them. “In a while, you will also draw the children who are going to form a temporary family with you. Our program aims to serve these children. Hence, the production crew will arrange tasks for you every day. These tasks are related to taking care of the children.

“When the mission ends, the production crew and the audience will give you marks. Of course, your ‘children’ will also give you marks. The pair with the lowest score every day will be punished. Similarly, the pair with the best performance will also receive corresponding rewards.

“Is everyone ready? Let’s start drawing lots.”

Before coming, Qiao Mianmian had a basic understanding of the children who would be on this show with them.

According to her understanding, the oldest Tong Tong was a caring and gentle boy, and he was the most sensible and obedient of the three children.

It didn’t take much effort to take care of him.

Doudou was a timid and dependent child. Although he was a boy, his personality was more like a girl’s.

As for the youngest Mengmeng, Qiao Mianmian didn’t know much about her. She only knew that she was a little girl as cute as her name. Anyway, she looked obedient and cute, so it shouldn’t be difficult to take care of her.

…

Soon, the results were out.

Qiao Mianmian and Qin Han picked the only girl among the three.

Zhan Bo’s team picked the dependent and timid Doudou.

Xu Min’er’s team picked the most sensible Tong Tong.

Although Qiao Mianmian felt a little regretful that she didn’t get the best Tong Tong, she quickly accepted the result happily.

She liked girls more.

She hoped that she could have a beautiful baby girl in the future.

She felt that it was good to take care of a daughter.

Xu Min’er’s team was also very happy. After all, everyone knew that Tong Tong was the easiest to take care of. Comparatively speaking, the difficulty of completing the mission was definitely the lowest.

Among the three of them, only Zhan Bo’s team didn’t have a good atmosphere. Zhan Bo wasn’t smiling, and he didn’t interact much with Jiang Xinyue. The two of them didn’t look like teammates, but strangers.

There were over 15 million viewers in the live stream.

Many people were watching and discussing.

Zhan Bo and Jiang Xinyue’s pair looked awkward, and more and more people criticized Zhan Bo.

“I feel like Zhan Bo is going overboard. Is there a need to keep a straight face? Jiang Xinyue is really unlucky to be in the same team as him.”

“What’s with Zhan Bo? Even if he really dislikes Jiang Xinyue, there’s no need to make it so obvious.”

“I think Zhan Bo is too much.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“I didn’t like Jiang Xinyue at first, but I pity her now.”

Zhan Bo’s fans were also in the live stream. Seeing people criticizing their idol, they immediately jumped out to speak up for him.

“I really didn’t expect someone to speak up for Jiang Xinyue. She’s such a shameless woman for trying to ride on others’ popularity and steal their show slot. Do you expect others to like someone like her?”

“That’s right. How is my brother overboard? It’s disgusting to be with such a shameless woman.”

“I pity my brother. He’s so unlucky to be with such a shameless woman!”
