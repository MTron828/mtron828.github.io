Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“I’m sorry, I don’t know anything. I really can’t answer.” Qiao Mianmian was forced back step by step by the reporters. Just as wondering what to do, a hand reached out from behind her and she bumped into a hard embrace.

A familiar scent surrounded her.

She looked up in shock.

The man’s handsome features entered her eyes. She widened her eyes and murmured, “Mo Yesi, why are you here...”

Mo Yesi didn’t say anything. After embracing her, he looked at the group of reporters coldly.

“If you have any questions, you can ask me..” He said coldly, “Make an appointment with my assistant first. I’ll choose a time to answer you.

“But before that, if you continue to harass my woman like this, I won’t let you have the chance to interview her in the future.”

The moment Mo Yesi appeared, the group of reporters pressing Qiao Mianmian a moment ago was shocked by his aura. For a moment, no one dared to step forward.

They were asking Qiao Mianmian about Mo Yesi.

Now that the main character had appeared, no one dared to ask anymore questions.

Mo Yesi left with Qiao Mianmian.

The reporters didn’t dare to block them anymore. They automatically made way and watched them leave.

After they left, a group of reporters snapped photos of their backs.

Although they didn’t get the information they wanted today, Mo Yesi’s arrival was enough for them to write a very juicy piece of news.

...

Qiao Mianmian was still in a daze after getting into the car with him.

She turned to look at the man beside her and blinked. “Mo Yesi, why are you here? Aren’t you at work today?”

Uncle Li was sitting in the front row.

After Mo Yesi got into the car, Uncle Li asked, “Young Master, where are we going?”

“To the airport.”

“Airport?” Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “No, my luggage is still at the hotel. I...”Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Get your assistant to pack it for you.”

“Alright.” Qiao Mianmian didn’t harp on this anymore. She took out her cell phone and called Nana. After saying a few words, she hung up.

She repeated her question. “You haven’t answered me. Why are you here?”

“I came to look for you, of course.” Mo Yesi looked at her expressionlessly. “Otherwise, why do you think I came?”

“I thought you might be on a business trip...”

“Mm, I’m on a business trip. I came to look for you, right?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Why did she sense a hint of unhappiness in his tone?

It was as if he had something against her.

She thought for a while and felt that she didn’t do anything to anger him.

Was he unhappy because of what the reporters said?

“That’s not what I meant. It’s just that I haven’t seen you in a long time. I’m a little surprised to see you all of a sudden.”

“Mm.” Mo Yesi nodded and smiled. “As you know, we haven’t seen each other in a long time.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

There was something wrong with his tone.

It sounded normal, but from her understanding of him, Qiao Mianmian felt that he was unhappy.
