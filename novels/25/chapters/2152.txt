Chapter 2154: You’ve Changed a Lot

“So, did Big Brother pay for it?” Qiao Mianmian asked her.

“Mm, it was him.” Jiang Luoli nodded and complained. “I really don’t know what he’s thinking. Why does he need to buy so many clothes and toys? Even if he really has a daughter, the baby will grow up very quickly. It won’t be long before she can’t wear these clothes and shoes.

“Isn’t it a waste?”

Although Jiang Luoli complained, she was smiling and didn’t look like she was really complaining at all.

Qiao Mianmian teased her. “But such waste makes you happy, right? If he’s so stingy that he can’t even bear to buy it, you’ll definitely complain about him.

“Luo Luo, you’re the Young Madam of the Mo family now. As long as we don’t produce a prodigal in the future, I think we won’t be able to use up all the money in three lifetimes. So, it’s just a little spending, you can accept his generosity with a clear conscience. This is something he bought for his child, it’s only right to buy more.”

“Wow, Baby.” Jiang Luoli covered her mouth and smiled.

“What’s wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?” Qiao Mianmian asked.

Jiang Luoli narrowed her eyes. “I realized that you’ve changed a lot.”

“I’ve changed?” Qiao Mianmian pointed at herself.

“Mm, you’ve changed. You definitely wouldn’t say that in the past.” Jiang Luoli smiled. “You’d have felt the same way as me in the past. You would’ve felt that it was wasteful and couldn’t bear to spend money like this. But you seem to be used to spending money like this now.”

Jiang Luoli was happy to see her best friend’s change.

Qiao Mianmian was spending more and more money, which meant that Mo Yesi really doted on her.

Because he had given her enough material needs, she didn’t want to save money.

She was willing to spend money.

Qiao Mianmian had never been like this with Su Ze. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Of course, Su Ze wasn’t stingy back then. He was rather generous to Qiao Mianmian.

But it was nothing compared to Mo Yesi’s generosity.

The difference between the Su and Mo families was obvious. Even if Su Ze gave the entire Su family’s wealth to Qiao Mianmian, how could it compare to 10% of Mo Yesi’s wealth?

Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

Then, she realized that her outlook on spending seemed to have changed.

In the past, she wouldn’t have advised Jiang Luoli like this.

She was stunned for a few seconds before smiling. “It seems like it. I wouldn’t have realized it if you didn’t tell me.

“But after hearing what you said, I think it makes sense. He bought it for his baby. He has the ability. Since he likes to spend, then let him spend more.

“That’s right. It’s so hard for a woman to give birth. Men can’t share our burden, so let them do it financially.”

“Mm, alright.” Jiang Luoli nodded. “I’ll listen to you.”

She looked up at the cashier and said, “Pack the rest of the clothes, too.”

“Alright, Miss Jiang. Please wait a moment.”
