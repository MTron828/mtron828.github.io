Chapter 323: Aren’t You... Being Too Biased

He’d gotten his assistant or secretary to settle it on his behalf.

He would never waste his time on such trivial matters.

Not to mention personally make a trip to the florist.

He had never done any of these before, not to anyone. But now, he was making exceptions over and over again, just for Qiao Mianmian alone.

In fact, all of his unusual actions these days had something to do with Qiao Mianmian.

At that moment, a strong surge of jealousy hit her.

And the fact that she’d been completely ignored and neglected by Mo Yesi made her feel even more awful.

At this point, Mo Yesi put his arm around Qiao Mianmian’s waist and turned around slowly.

He looked at Shen Rou. “What are you waiting for? Go onto the stage and apologize.”

Shen Rou went pale. “Ah Si.”

She pursed her lips and drew a deep breath. “As I said, it was all a misunderstanding. I’m willing to apologize for my mistake, but isn’t going onstage too much?”

That would trample all over her dignity.

She would never agree to it.

Moreover, she didn’t really feel that she was maligning Qiao Chen.

Even if Shen Xin took the initiative to pursue Qiao Chen, was he necessarily innocent?

If he didn’t have any interest in Shen Xin, would he have come to the restaurant for a date with her?

All of his supposed rejections only served to reinforce her desire for him.

Shen Xin was just innocent enough to fall into his trap.

Mo Yesi didn’t seem to care about the years of friendship they shared as he used his no-nonsense voice. “You think that’s too much? What about the things you just did, don’t you find that too much as well? Shen Rou, you can’t have double standards. If you’ve done something wrong, you need to apologize sincerely.

“As for how that should be done, it’s up to the other party.

“Mianmian already proposed the solution. I hope you’ll be courageous enough to admit your mistake by giving Qiao Chen a proper apology onstage.”

Mo Yesi actually had no idea what exactly happened.

He just heard what Qiao Mianmian said when he arrived.

But he trusted his wife.

His wife surely couldn’t be in the wrong, so it must have been Shen Rou’s fault.

Shen Rou looked at him, incredulous. “Ah Si, you know how embarrassing it is to apologize on stage, and you’re making me do it? We’ve known each other for so many years, but you trust that woman you’ve just met more than you trust me? Does she have the final say in everything?!

“Aren’t you... being too biased.” Shen Rou bit her lip, and her eyes reddened.

Although Shen Xin was still angry at what Shen Rou had done, she did feel that making a public apology was too embarrassing.

Her sister was so prideful, how could she accept this?

Moreover, her sister and Brother Yesi were friends for so many years.

Why would Brother Yesi be on someone else’s side?

And, did Qiao Chen call Brother Yesi “Brother-in-law”? RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Brother Yesi, this is all my fault.” Tears could still be seen in Shen Xin’s eyes, and she was trying not to choke on her words. “Let me apologize on stage instead. Sister misunderstood things between Qiao Chen and me only because she was worried about me.”

Mo Yesi didn’t bother about her. He kept his cold gaze on Shen Rou and said, “To me, Mianmian isn’t a woman I’ve just known. She’s my wife, my missus, a very important woman in my heart.”
