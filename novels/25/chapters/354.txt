Chapter 357: She Probably Won’t Pester Me Anymore

“The doctor said that maintaining a happy mood is beneficial for your body. I just hope that you’ll always be happy and not have too much trouble.”

Taken aback, Qiao Chen looked away from the window.

Turning around, he glanced at his sister and suddenly felt his heart turn sour. With suddenly reddened eyes, he choked up and said, “Sister, I didn’t deliberately hide it from you. I just thought I could handle it by myself and that there was no need to tell you.

“Shen Xin and I...” The tear-stained face appeared in his mind, and Qiao Chen felt a slight stab of pain in his heart. “She’s my classmate and my deskmate. She said she liked me and wanted to chase me. She wanted me to be her boyfriend.

“But I rejected her many times.

“She said that it was her birthday today and that many of our classmates would go to the restaurant to celebrate it. So, I went too.”

Qiao Mianmian nodded after listening to him.

She roughly understood what had happened.

Therefore, Qiao Chen hadn’t made an appointment to eat dinner alone with Shen Xin. He had been fooled by her.

“Sister, don’t worry. I won’t date too early.” Qiao Chen finished speaking and took a deep breath. He squeezed out a smile after seeing Qiao Mianmian’s worried expression. “I’ve already told her clearly today. She probably won’t pester me anymore.

“I’ll study hard and enter a good university. These things won’t affect me.”

Seeing him put on a tough front, Qiao Mianmian’s heart ached in distress.

How could she not understand her own brother?

Perhaps he really didn’t like Shen Xin at first.

But it was easy for girls to chase boys. Furthermore, Shen Xin was such a pretty and cute girl. After several years of hard pursuit, Qiao Chen would find it difficult to maintain his original intentions and not feel moved by her.

If he really didn’t care, he wouldn’t be in this current state. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Mianmian wanted to comfort him, but she didn’t know what to say.

Although she could see through him, it wasn’t easy to ask.

To her, the result now was considered good.

From Shen Rou’s attitude towards Qiao Chen, it was obvious that the Shen family’s concept of family status was very important.

The Shen family definitely looked down on the Qiao family now.

It didn’t mean much even if Shen Xin really liked Qiao Chen.

Furthermore, when they went to university in the future, they might be separated across the country. With the Shen family’s emphasis on family status, would they allow Shen Xin and Qiao Chen to be together?

Rage bubbled in her at the thought of Shen Rou’s contemptuous words.

After all, if Mo Yesi hadn’t been there, she wouldn’t have let Shen Rou leave like that.

Mo Yesi was already in a deadlock because of her and Gong Zeli, so she didn’t want to cause him too much trouble.

Now, she felt like Qiao Chen had completely rejected Shen Xin. Judging by her reaction, she must have given up on him.

This result was good for both of them.

Even if the two young people would be upset for a while because of this incident, it would be better than the pain of being together.

“Yes, I trust you. You can figure it out yourself.” After a moment of silence, she lightly put her hand on his shoulder and earnestly said, “Chen Chen, the most important thing to me now is for you to perform the surgery as soon as possible. That way, you’ll be able to recover sooner.

“This is more important than anything else.”

Qiao Chen’s eyes were a little gloomy at the thought of his illness.

Shen Xin didn’t know he was sick yet.

Would she still like him if she knew he had heart disease and could die at any time?
