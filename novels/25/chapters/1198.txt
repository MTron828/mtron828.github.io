Chapter 1200: Suddenly Regretting

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

She was a woman, yet her heart was already moved.

Qiao Mianmian was a little embarrassed by the compliment. She blushed and said, “Thank you.”

The evening gown revealed a little of her shoulders, her slender neck, and collarbone. The fishtail design further elongated her original good figure.

Qiao Mianmian was 1.65 meters tall.

However, wearing this evening gown had a visual of 1.70 m.

She looked at herself in the mirror. For the first time, she felt that a straight man’s sense of beauty was very reliable.

She especially liked the dress he had custom-made for her.

Qiao Mianmian stood in front of the mirror and indulged herself for a while before remembering that Mo Yesi was still waiting for her.

In the waiting room.

Mo Yesi was reading an electronic file that Wei Zheng had sent him.

“Mr. Mo, Miss Qiao has already changed into her evening gown.”

He heard footsteps approaching and then the shop assistant’s voice.

Mo Yesi looked up calmly.

The moment his gaze landed on Qiao Mianmian, a look of amazement flashed across his eyes.

His expression was no longer as calm as before.

His dark eyes silently sized up the fairy-like girl in front of him from head to toe. His deep gaze finally landed on her fair and exquisite face.

Mo Yesi suddenly regretted it.

He regretted ordering such a gown for her.

Her beauty could only be seen by him alone.

He did not want others to discover her beautiful side.

At this moment, the girl before him was too stunning and dazzling.

At that moment, even he was moved by her beauty.

Not to mention other men.

“How is it?” Qiao Mianmian lifted the hem of her dress, feeling a little uncomfortable from his stare. “I think the size is very suitable and the style is not bad. What do you think?”

The long dress she was wearing was not too revealing, giving off a frivolous feeling. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

But it wasn’t so conservative to make people feel rigid.

The innocence of a young girl and the charm of a woman were displayed very well.

Mo Yesi’s eyes were filled with amazement, and he was frustrated.

He wanted to say that this dress was not good and that she did not look good in it. He wanted to choose another one for her.

However, he couldn’t bring himself to say that.

The staff said from the side, “Mr. Mo, the dress you ordered for Miss Qiao suits her very well. Miss Qiao is too beautiful in this dress. She looks as pretty as a fairy.”

She was indeed as pretty as a fairy.

It was just that he couldn’t bear to let others see such a beautiful her.

“Mm, it’s not bad.” He couldn’t bring himself to say things that went against his conscience, but Mo Yesi didn’t want to tell Qiao Mianmian that she looked especially beautiful in this dress.

The man put on a serious expression and suggested, “But I think there might be something more suitable for you. Do you want to look at other designs?”

When he said that, the employees were stunned.

She looked at him in surprise.

Wasn’t that good enough?

They all thought she was super beautiful.

Moreover, this was a custom-made dress, not one that could be chosen in different styles.

If he found it unsuitable, wouldn’t it be a waste of a dress that cost millions?
