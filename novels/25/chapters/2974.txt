“Mom, how can we let you buy a house for us? It should us, the younger ones, buying it for you. We should be filial to you.” Qiao Mianmian leaned against Madam Bai and said softly.

Madam Bai was so happy that her eyes formed a straight line. “Good child, I’m satisfied with your filial piety. I don’t want anything. I’m happy as long as you and Yesi live happily ever after.

“Oh right, do you know what’s going on with your brother?” Madam Bai changed the topic and looked worried. “Wasn’t he and Xiao Ya… fine previously? Why did they suddenly break up?

“Lasked your brother, but he refused to tell me the truth. Mianmian, do you know what happened? Did your brother do something wrong to her and hurt her so much that she broke up with him?”

Madam Bai didn’t know what Tang Ya had done.

Therefore, when Bai Yusheng told her that he had broken up with Tang Ya, Madam Bai was both worried and upset. She had been upset about it for the past few days.

Her son, who had been single for thirty years, finally found a girlfriend and brought her home. But she had only met his family before they broke up.

Madam Bai thought that she would be able to see her son marry her soon.

She even thought that she might be able to have a grandchild next year.

Bai Yusheng’s sudden breakup had a huge impact on her.

“Did your brother tell you why he broke up with Tang Ya?” Hearing her mother’s question, Qiao Mianmian knew that Bai Yusheng had probably not told her the truth. Otherwise, she wouldn’t think that he had let Tang Ya down.

“Lasked him, and he said that the two of them don’t get along, but I don’t believe him.” Madam Bai was still upset about this. “Mianmian, you must know the reason, right? Tell me, why did they break up?”

“It wasn’t easy for your brother to find a girlfriend, but they broke so quickly. I think it’s a pity.”

Madam Bai was even more worried about what would happen if her son lost his interest in women after this breakup.

‘What if he chose to remain single forever?

Qiao Mianmian hesitated for a while.

“Is there something you can’t say?” Mother Bai frowned when she saw that Qiao Mianmian was silent. “Did your brother really let her down? If it’s his fault, I’l definitely beat him up.”

“No, Brother didn’t let her down.” Qiao Mianmian was afraid that Madam Bai would be upset if she found out the truth, but she also didn’t want her to misunderstand Bai Yusheng, After hesitating for a while, she sighed. “Mom, actually.

Qiao Mianmian felt that Madam Bai would find out the truth sooner or later, so she might as well tell her now.

Otherwise, she might even want Tang Ya and Bai Yusheng to get back together.

“What?!” Madam Bai was stunned. “They were never really dated? Mianmian, what do you mean?”

“Tt means that they were not really dating.”

Qiao Mianmian thought that since she had already spilled the beans, she might as well tell her mother everything so that she wouldn’t have any hopes. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

A moment later.

After learning the truth, Madam Bai was shocked, as if she couldn’t believe what she had just heard.

“So, Tang Ya got together with your brother because she wanted to take revenge on the Mo Family? Your brother didn’t like her, but he dated her to beat her at her own game?”

actually, Brother and Tang Ya… they’ve never really been together.”
