Chapter 541: Come and Join the Party

“Don’t worry, I won’t affect his work.” Shen Rou smiled sweetly. “It’s not as if I haven’t waited for him before. He used to leave me on my own for hours when he was busy, and I’d just occupy myself.”

Wei Zheng was left speechless.

That was not what he meant.

“Personal Assistant Wei, are you waiting for someone?” Shen Rou could tell that Wei Zheng was waiting to receive somebody, but she didn’t think that the “somebody” was Qiao Mianmian. She thought it was an important client.

Wei Zheng nodded.

He was about to say that he was waiting for Qiao Mianmian when Shen Rou smiled and said thoughtfully, “In that case, I’ll just go up on my own. I shan’t bother you at work. Oh, right. Personal Assistant Wei, it’s my birthday next Saturday, come and join the party.”

Shen Rou was someone with great confidence and aspirations.

Because of her background, she’d always been served and treated as a First Miss.

She and Mo Yesi were actually similar—they were both rather cold and proud. Although she might seem approachable on the surface, not many people actually mattered to her enough for her to get to know.

It was only because Wei Zheng was Mo Yesi’s personal assistant that he was given “special treatment.”

She was being nicer to Wei Zheng than she was to the average person.

The fact that she’d officially invite Wei Zheng to her birthday party said enough.

This wasn’t what most people would ever get to experience.

Upon hearing about her birthday, Wei Zheng forgot what he had been about to say.

He looked at the woman smiling at him and was a little swayed. He nodded and said, “Sure, Miss Shen. I’ll be there.”

“Don’t forget to come.” Shen Rou patted him on the shoulder lightly and then strutted off.

A sweet scent drifted around Wei Zheng.

It didn’t dissipate for a while.

He couldn’t identify what scent it was, but it was rather seductive.

By the time he turned around, he saw that she was already in the lobby waiting for the elevator. He felt a little threatened on Qiao Mianmian’s behalf.

Miss Shen was really beautiful.

And she was elegant, too.

She was also a gifted student who studied in an overseas elite school. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

If she really liked Chairman Mo, Young Madam would be facing a strong rival.

Although Young Madam was also very beautiful and wasn’t inferior to Miss Shen in terms of looks, she missed out on all other aspects.

The Shen family was too many times better than the Qiao family who was in shambles now.

Even at their peak, the Qiao family wasn’t in the same league as the Shens.

Moreover, Miss Shen and Chairman Mo grew up together.

That alone was rather threatening.

Apparently, Chairman Mo and Miss Shen were just platonic friends because Miss Shen had never officially pursued him.

If Miss Shen had taken a little more initiative and was a little more courageous back then, and had chosen to officially go after him.

Would Young Madam not be in the picture today?

“Personal Assistant Wei.”

Just as all these thoughts were messing with his head, Wei Zheng heard a sweet voice by his ear.

He turned around and saw that Qiao Mianmian was standing right before him. Instinctively, he turned towards the elevator lobby again, only to see Shen Rou enter the elevator.

“Y-Young Madam, you’re here.” Wei Zheng was caught in a fix.
