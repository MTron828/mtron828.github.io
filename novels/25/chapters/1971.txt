Chapter 1974: No Regrets Anymore

Bai Yusheng was usually calm and reserved, and sometimes cold. No one expected him to be like this at home.

He was like a child who hadn’t grown up yet, teasing his parents.

Moreover, from their interaction, it was obvious they were always like this at home.

Qiao Mianmian felt warm inside as she listened to her family’s laughter.

This warmth seeped into her heart and warmed it.

She hadn’t felt such warmth in a long time. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Ever since Madam Qiao and her grandmother passed away, that so-called home was no longer warm.

It was Qiao Anxin and Lin Huizhen’s house.

But it wasn’t her and Qiao Chen’s house anymore.

But now, she was so lucky. Not only did she have a new home, but she also had so many family members who loved and treated her well.

At this moment, she felt that she had no regrets.

She really liked her current life.

...

The dishes were served.

Qiao Mianmian looked at the table. Almost two-thirds of the dishes were her favorites.

She liked spicy food, but she knew that Bai Yusheng and Madam Bai didn’t really like it.

And Mo Yesi couldn’t touch any spicy food. The last time he ate hot pot with her, his stomach hurt and he even took medicine for a few days.

But today, Madam Bai’s dishes were mainly spicy.

The remaining one-third of the light food was made for Mo Yesi.

Otherwise, Madam Bai would have prepared a table of spicy dishes for her precious daughter.

As for the others?

She didn’t care what her husband and son liked to eat or whether they could eat spicy food.

If they couldn’t eat it, they could get the kitchen to prepare something else.

Her precious daughter only came back once in a while, so naturally, she prepared the food she liked.

Madam Bai got Qiao Mianmian to sit beside her.

During the meal, Madam Bai didn’t bother to eat and kept putting food into Qiao Mianmian’s bowl.

“Mianmian, try this chili pepper fish head. The flavor of the chili peppers is fully infused into the food. They diced up wild mountain pepper that had been pickled for years and stuffed it into the fish head for a long period of steaming. The sour and spicy taste fully pervades the fish.

“And this spicy chicken. The chicken is fried and crispy. I tried one. It’s delicious.

“And this...”

Qiao Mianmian’s bowl was piled up like a small mountain. She ate a few mouthfuls when Madam Bai placed more food into her bowl.

Madam Bai gave her more food faster than she could eat.

It didn’t take long before the bowl was filled to the brim.

Madam Bai continued putting food into Qiao Mianmian’s bowl.

As she picked up the food, she said enthusiastically, “Mianmian, eat quickly. Why aren’t you eating? Is the food today not to your liking?”

“No, these dishes are all very delicious.” Qiao Mianmian looked at the food in her bowl and wanted to stop Madam Bai, but she didn’t know what to say.

“Mom, who does things like you? Can Mianmian finish it all?” Bai Yusheng saw his sister’s helplessness and stopped his mother. “Don’t keep staring at Mianmian. Eat some yourself. Mianmian’s bowl is full. If you put more food into her bowl, it will spill out.”

Madam Bai was stunned. She looked at Qiao Mianmian’s bowl and saw that it was full.
