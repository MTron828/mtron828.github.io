Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Miss Jiang.”

Jiang Luoli brought Qiao Mianmian into the hall. Sister Lin walked towards them and looked at Qiao Mianmian. “This lady is?”

What a beautiful girl.

“Sister Lin, this is my best friend. Her name is Qiao Mianmian. Oh right, she’s Second Young Master’s wife.”

“Second Young Master’s wife?” Sister Lin was stunned for a moment before reacting. “This-This is Second Young Madam?”

She immediately greeted her respectfully. “Hello, Second Madam.”

This was the first time Sister Lin saw Qiao Mianmian.

But she had heard about Second Young Master’s marriage from the old residence.

She heard that Second Young Madam was a very beautiful young lady, like a fairy.

She was stunning.

That was why Second Young Master was so tempted.

Back then, Sister Lin thought that she was as beautiful as a fairy. How beautiful was she?

Could she be prettier than the one in the Shen family?

Could she be prettier than Miss Jiang?

Now, Sister Lin finally saw her in person.

She had to admit that Second Young Madam was really good-looking.

Even an old woman like her couldn’t help but feel that she was too beautiful.

No wonder Second Young Master, who was never interested in women, fell for her. Any man would.

“Hello, Sister Lin.” Qiao Mianmian smiled and nodded.

“Miss Jiang and Second Young Madam are really sisters. This Second Young Madam is married to our Second Young Master, and Miss Jiang and Second Young Madam are very good friends. Now Miss Jiang is dating Mister.”

Sister Lin smiled and said, “If Miss Jiang marries Mister in the future, won’t she become Second Young Madam’s sister-in-law? Then, you two will become family. Aiya, such friendship is really enviable.”

Jiang Luoli blushed. “Sister Lin, Mo Shixiu and I have just started dating. It’s still early to get married.”

“No, no.” Sister Lin smiled and looked at her. “Mister has already decided on you. It’s only a matter of time before you get married. I feel that as long as Miss Jiang is willing, Mister can’t wait to marry you.”

“Sister Lin...”

Jiang Luoli blushed. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Alright, alright. I’ll get Second Young Madam some tea. Have a good chat, I won’t disturb you.” Sister Lin left with a smile.

Qiao Mianmian could tell that Mo Shixiu’s people respected Jiang Luoli.

Jiang Luoli seemed to be on good terms with them.

She felt more at ease.

Like Mo Yesi, Mo Shixiu moved out of the old house to live on his own.

Hence, everyone in the house acted according to their wishes.

The people they valued were naturally valued too.

Hence, Qiao Mianmian wasn’t worried that Jiang Luoli would be aggrieved by Mo Shixiu.

She was worried that Madam Mo would find trouble with Jiang Luoli.

She wondered if Madam Mo knew of Jiang Luoli’s existence.

If she knew, she definitely wouldn’t be indifferent.

“Luo Luo, did any strangers look for you recently?” Qiao Mianmian asked worriedly.

“Strangers?” Jiang Luoli blinked and turned to look at her. “What strangers are you talking about? Many strangers are looking for me every day. Do harassment phone calls count?”
