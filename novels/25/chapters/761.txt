Chapter 763: It’s Huang Yilin’s Turn Today

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

But Huang Yilin was different.

She was one of the most popular female artistes in the entertainment industry, and her character was usually one of the most positive ones.

But such a female artiste was rumored to have been involved with big shots in the entertainment industry before, and many even married.

The image that she’d painstakingly built instantly collapsed.

Some of Huang Yilin’s loyal fans were still struggling and insisting that the photos and videos were all photoshopped.

They said they trusted Linlin’s character.

Some fans even said that the woman in the video wasn’t Huang Yilin, but a woman who looked like her.

In any case, anyone could tell that it was Huang Yilin.

Only the fans were feigning ignorance.

Huang Yilin’s own Weibo was still silent.

Only the studio sent a lawyer’s letter.

The netizens and fans went to the studio to comment. Seeing more and more comments and reposts, the studio closed the comment section.

Meanwhile.

The account that exposed Huang Yilin’s scandals was openly provoking her studio, telling them to come at them as they wished. If they wanted a lawsuit, they could take them on. They even claimed to have other scandals about Huang Yilin.

Netizens left comments under the account, asking if they had any new melons to eat today.

The account name was: Mysterious Person.

Mysterious Person replied to the netizens: [I can’t eat too many melons at once, it’s too stuffy. Wait for me to post more.]

A netizen asked him again: [Do you have a feud with Huang Yilin?]

Mysterious Person replied: [I don’t have a feud with her. My Lady Boss has a feud with her.]

His reply caused a heated discussion among the netizens.

They were all discussing who the lady boss was.

All the women related to Huang Yilin were analyzed by the netizens.

Qiao Mianmian quietly watched the netizens’ imaginations run wild. After a while, she felt someone’s gaze on her. She looked up and saw Nana looking at her with a burning gaze.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

She felt uncomfortable being stared at by her and touched her cheek. “What’s wrong? What are you looking at?”

“Sister Mianmian, do you think your boyfriend got someone to do this?”

Qiao Mianmian was shocked.

Just as she was about to ask her why she asked that, Nana whispered, “Your boyfriend must have seen your scandal yesterday and used his real power to find out that it was Huang Yilin who did it. Then, the domineering CEO got someone to collect all the negative news about her to take revenge for you. Wow, he’s so handsome and manly. He’s definitely capable of protecting his wife.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

It seemed like she overestimated Nana.

She thought she’d guessed something.

But it turned out to be a problem from reading too many novels with domineering CEOs.

It was just a delusional disorder.

“Sister Mianmian, have you really never thought that your boyfriend has another identity? The more I think about it, the more I feel that his identity isn’t simple. He definitely isn’t just the boss of a small company. Otherwise, how could this be such a coincidence? You were exposed yesterday, and now it’s Huang Yilin’s turn.

“It’s not like no one has dug up Huang Yilin’s scandals before. But how could they be compared to the ones today?”
