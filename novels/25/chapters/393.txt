Chapter 396: You’ve Been Sabotaged

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

His wife would always let him hug her or kiss her whenever he wanted to.

But now, even hugs and kisses had become simply a dream to him.

However, he had already agreed to this and couldn’t back out now.

The only thing he could do was to put on his best behavior and perform well so he could quickly succeed in “pursuing” her.

...

After Qiao Mianmian returned to school, she sent a quick text to Jiang Luoli and headed straight to the library to find her.

She wasn’t sure if it was her own illusion.

But everyone seemed to be staring at her once she walked into the library.

They all seemed to be discussing something under their breaths.

Qiao Mianmian was always a high-profile and well-known person in the whole campus, as she was known to be the “beauty queen” of the performing arts faculty.

Plus, most people knew that she had a rich second-generation heir as her boyfriend. So, naturally, many people knew of her or had heard of her.

But their gazes towards her today were vastly different from the past.

She had a strange feeling in her heart as she walked another round around the library before finding Jiang Luoli.

“Baby, I’m here.”

Jiang Luoli waved as she spotted her.

As Qiao Mianmian made her way over to her, Jiang Luoli removed the bag she placed beside her to reserve the seat for Qiao Mianmian. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

She waited for Qiao Mianmian to be seated.

Pulling her over immediately, Jiang Luoli spoke with a suppressed voice. “Baby, you’ve been sabotaged by someone. Have you seen the post on the online student forum page?”

Qiao Mianmian’s expression blanked. “What post?”

Jiang Luoli was silent for a moment. “You haven’t seen it yet? Someone posted some bad rumors regarding you on the school forum page. That post has over a thousand views and re-posts as of now. I have a major suspicion that whoever did this bought over some people for fake comments. Everyone commenting on the post is scolding you.”

Jiang Luoli couldn’t contain her anger as she spoke about it. “What the hell! I don’t know which bastard is purposely out to screw you over! Those bad rumors that the person posted are so unbelievably ridiculous and are just trying to bring you down.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

No wonder everyone’s gaze towards her when she walked into the library just now felt so weird.

So, all this was because someone sabotaged her?

Qiao Mianmian immediately whipped out her phone, logged into the school forum page, and saw the notorious post right away.

As many people viewed and re-posted it, it was high up on the trending list and was easy to find.

The caption caught her attention at once—

[Breaking News! The Pure And Innocent Beauty Queen Of The Performing Arts Faculty, Qiao Mianmian, Is Actually A Fully Experienced Woman Who Got An Abortion Back In High School? Would You Dare To Believe It?]

Qiao Mianmian felt something stuck in her throat as she read the caption itself.

Jiang Luoli reached over to pat her shoulder. “Calm down, don’t panic. Are you sure you want to see what’s written? I’m afraid you won’t be able to take it.”

The content was much worse than the caption itself.

When Jiang Luoli first saw this post, she was so furious she wanted to stab the person who posted it in the back.

How much more furious and upset would Qiao Mianmian feel when she saw it herself?

But she had to tell her about this matter.

As the post got more popular, more people scolded Qiao Mianmian in the comments section.

If they were to just let this post spread like this without doing anything, it would definitely affect Qiao Mianmian greatly.

People always easily believed in rumors.

Even if evidence was insufficient, as long as the rumor spread widely enough, it would slowly turn into fact by the end.

It would then be way too late to stop it.

So, she had to tell Qiao Mianmian about it first.

Her best friend now had a sturdy and reliable person to back her up. She was very certain that her male God would help Mianmian to settle everything cleanly.

Qiao Mianmian took in a long and deep breath to calm herself down before she spoke. “Yup, I want to see it. I am actually curious to see what these people are saying about me.”
