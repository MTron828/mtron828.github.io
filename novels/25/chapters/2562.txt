“I made this decision after careful consideration. Don’t worry, since I was the one who suggested this, I’m already prepared. I’ll definitely take good care of you and our baby.

“Moreover, if Big Brother can do it, I can do it too. You have to have confidence in your husband.”

“That might not be the case.” Qiao Mianmian looked at the man’s handsome features and couldn’t help but feel her heart race.

His eyes were so gentle and loving.

“Mm?” Mo Yesi raised an eyebrow. “What might not be the case?”

Qiao Mianmian smiled cheekily and reached out to touch his face. Her fingers brushed past his thick black brows, then landed on his deep eyes, and then on his well-defined nose bridge…

She seemed to be copying a painting, and he was the god in it.

Every line on his face was so beautiful that it made her heart race.

Even if they had to face each other every day, she would probably never get sick of this face.

She wondered if she would still feel attracted to him when they were old.

Like a young girl who had just fallen in love. Her heart would race when she saw him…

She hoped she would.

“You might not be able to do what Big Brother can do.” Qiao Mianmian blinked and pretended to not trust him. “Big Brother is a few years older than you, he must be more experienced.

“It’s not surprising that he can take good care of Luo Luo and their baby. As for you…”

“What about me?”

Her hand slid to his cold lips, warming them with her fingertips. Mo Yesi’s eyes darkened, and he quietly grabbed her little hand.

He kissed the back of her hand and chuckled. “You don’t believe that I can take good care of you and our baby? Baby, do you have so little confidence in me? Or are you telling me that I don’t take good care of you?”

Strange…

His lips were cold.

But the kiss on the back of her hand made Qiao Mianmian feel warm.

Her heart beat faster.

She looked up and met his smiling eyes. For some reason, her face started to burn.

Ah, Qiao Mianmian, this man is your husband.

This isn’t the first time you’re seeing him. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

You’re no longer a little girl in love.

Why are you so useless?

In front of her husband, she was still like a young girl in love, blushing and with a racing heart.

How pathetic.

She despised herself!!

But she couldn’t be blamed.

She could only blame Mo Yesi for being too handsome.

She had a handsome husband, what could she do?

“Mm?” She heard a low chuckle, then the man’s seductive voice sounded. “Baby, what do you want for you to agree?

“You can ask me for anything.

“As long as you promise to give me a baby, I’ll give you whatever you want, alright?”

The man’s voice got lower and lower.

He seemed to be whispering into her ear.

Qiao Mianmian’s heart had never calmed down, and now it was beating faster and faster…
