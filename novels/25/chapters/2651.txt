Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “Mo Yesi, you…”

Mo Yesi squeezed her hand. “There are some things I want to make public. It’s fine to let them ask.”

The reporters were also stunned for a few seconds.

They thought Mo Yesi was going to flare up.

They didn’t expect him to be willing to accept an interview.

This was a rare thing.

Everyone knew that the Chairman of the Mo Corporation wouldn’t accept interviews casually.

It was even harder to interview him.

Hence, when he first returned to the country, even though he took over the position of Chairman and became the youngest Executive Chairman in the history of the Mo Corporation, there were no interviews about him. Hence, most people didn’t know Chairman Mo’s appearance.

If his relationship with Qiao Mianmian hadn’t been exposed, most people wouldn’t have known what he looked like.

Including the reporters.

They knew how difficult it was to interview Mo Yesi, so they were shocked and pleasantly surprised when they heard what he said.

They couldn’t react in time. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Mr. Mo, can I really ask you anything?” A few seconds later, a reporter asked excitedly.

Mo Yesi glanced at the reporter. “Normal questions are fine, but if it’s messy, then don’t ask.”

“Of course, of course.” The reporter sounded even more agitated. “Our questions are definitely normal. So, can we start now?”

Mo Yesi nodded in response.

The reporter immediately took the opportunity to ask, “Mr. Mo, can you answer this? How did you buy your wife’s dress and jewelry? Because we all know that the designs of Aaron Smith and MR.S can’t be bought with money.

“A princess wanted to buy your wife’s dress, but Aaron Smith didn’t agree.

“As for MR.S, he’s a very mysterious designer and has never designed jewelry for anyone. I wonder how Mr. Mo found him and persuaded him to design this unique blue diamond jewelry for your wife.”

“I can answer these two questions.” Under the expectant and nervous gaze of the reporters, Mo Yesi said calmly, “Aaron Smith and I are friends. I once helped him with something. I told him that my wife liked the dress he designed, so he gave it to me.

“MR.S has indeed never designed jewelry for anyone. Because in his opinion, only his most beloved person is worthy of his designs.” Mo Yesi turned to look at the person beside him.

Qiao Mianmian was staring at him in shock.

The reporters were also shocked.

Mo Yesi had just said that MR.S only designed jewelry for his beloved person.

But now, Qiao Mianmian was wearing MR.S’s jewelry.

This…

Qiao Mianmian was MR.S’s lover?

If that was the case, why would Mo Yesi, as her husband, say such things so calmly?

Did he not mind?

Did he not mind that his wife was being coveted by other men?

This didn’t seem like his style.

Even Qiao Mianmian thought so..
