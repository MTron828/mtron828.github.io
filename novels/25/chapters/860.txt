Chapter 861: If Qiao Mianmian Was Really His Sister, How Good Would That Be

“It’s really him?”

Qiao Mianmian looked incredulous. After confirming that the person she was going to meet was really the “Music Godfather” Mo Nan, she suddenly got nervous.

She stopped in her tracks and tugged at Bai Yusheng’s sleeve. “Brother Bai, I don’t think we should go.”

Bai Yusheng stopped in his tracks and looked down at her. “Why? You don’t want to see him?”

This was a dream come true for many.

Even if Qiao Mianmian wasn’t from the music industry.

But no one would reject meeting such a big shot.

“No.” Qiao Mianmian told him the truth. “I’m just a little afraid.”

“Afraid?” Bai Yusheng raised his brows and found it amusing. “What are you afraid of?”

“I think Senior Mo Nan is a very serious person. He doesn’t seem easy to talk to.” Qiao Mianmian always said whatever she wanted in front of Bai Yusheng. She thought about Mo Nan’s serious look and felt a little afraid.

She’d never interacted with him before.

But she had some understanding of Mo Nan.

She heard that he had a strange temper. Sun Fei, who had worked with him for many years, said that she was afraid of him sometimes.

Especially when he was at work.

If her performance wasn’t satisfactory, he wouldn’t give face to anyone, no matter who they were.

Even a queen like Sun Fei had been scolded by him before.

Qiao Mianmian was a newbie, how could she not be afraid when she was suddenly told that she would meet him?

Bai Yusheng couldn’t help but chuckle when he heard that she was actually afraid of Mo Nan because of this. He patted her on the head and said in a tone that even he didn’t notice, “What are you afraid of? With me around, can he eat you up?

“That guy isn’t as scary as you think. If he dares to scold you, I’ll back you up and help you get back at him, alright?

“Mianmian, this is a very good opportunity. Since you’re talented in singing, you shouldn’t waste it.” Bai Yusheng suddenly said seriously, “I know you want to develop in the entertainment industry, but there’s no need to reject other opportunities.

“Isn’t it better to develop in so many ways and accumulate popularity in the film and television industry and the music industry? I happen to have the resources in this area, and I can help you introduce people, so you can take fewer detours. If you really don’t want to see Mo Nan because you’re afraid of him, then you can rest assured.”

He smiled again. “You’re the one I brought along. He has to give me face no matter what. He won’t be too serious in front of you.”

Qiao Mianmian knew that Bai Yusheng was doing this for her own good.

He really treated her like a sister.

Not only did he give her a chance to play the female lead role, he even brought her to meet Mo Nan.

He’d given her some serious advice.

If she rejected him again, she would really be insensible. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Alright, Brother Bai. I’ll go with you.” She looked at him with trust and said softly, “I believe you.”

Bai Yusheng couldn’t help but stroke her head.

This girl was so obedient.

Especially when that pair of bright eyes looked at him with trust, Bai Yusheng’s heart softened.

He thought that it would be great if Qiao Mianmian was really his sister.
