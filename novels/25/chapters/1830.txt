Chapter 1833: This Was the First Time He Took the Initiative to Hug Her Like This

“If I’m not good to you, who else am I supposed to be good to? Of course, you deserve any sacrifice.

“Luoli, I said that I would treat you well. I promised you that I would do it. Otherwise, it would become empty talk.”

“Then... won’t you regret it?”

“I never regret my decisions. Luoli, I want to ask you a question.” Mo Shixiu looked down at the beautiful girl in his arms and asked softly, “Are you happy being with me? Are you happy?”

“Mm.” Jiang Luoli nodded.

No matter what, Mo Shixiu was a very qualified boyfriend.

Jiang Luoli was really happy when she was with him.

“That’s good.” Mo Shixiu curled his lips. “I was afraid you’d feel bored with me. If I didn’t do something right, you must tell me. I’m not very good at dating, but I can learn.”

He wasn’t afraid of learning things he wasn’t good at because of her.

What he was afraid of was that she would keep her displeasure to herself and not let him know.

The two of them sat on the sofa and talked to each other for a while.

“It’s getting late. You should go to bed,” Mo Shixiu said as he got up and picked her up.

Jiang Luoli did not expect him to do this. She exclaimed in surprise and hurriedly wrapped her arms around his neck.

Mo Shixiu was reserved and calm. In Jiang Luoli’s eyes, he was too mature.

Usually, he would not take the initiative to be intimate with her.

Even when Jiang Luoli took the initiative to get close to him, he would feel a little uncomfortable.

It was only after Jiang Luoli shamelessly threw herself into his arms many times that he slowly got used to it.

This was the first time he took the initiative to hug her like this.

And in front of so many maids in the hall, he carried her like a princess.

Jiang Luoli raised her head and looked at him in surprise. She felt that there was something wrong with this man today.

The maids standing in the living room were shocked when they saw this scene.

Everyone in the residence knew what Mo Shixiu’s usual behavior was like.

Therefore, when they suddenly saw him carrying Jiang Luoli, they were all surprised.

Sister Lin walked over with the freshly brewed tea. When she saw this scene, she, like everyone else, had a surprised expression on her face.

Then, she pursed her lips and smiled happily.

Sir and Miss Jiang were getting closer and closer.

Sir liked Miss Jiang more and more.

It seemed she would soon be able to eat Sir and Miss Jiang’s wedding candies.

Sister Lin held the freshly brewed tea and signaled to the maids. Soon, she quietly left the living room with the maids.

If Sir and Miss Jiang got intimate and they stayed in the hall, wouldn’t they become eyesores?

However, Sister Lin was thinking too much.

Although Mo Shixiu had changed a lot after being with Jiang Luoli, he was still a steady and traditional man.

It was impossible for him to do something like making out in front of everyone in the hall.

“It’s only ten o’clock. I don’t want to sleep so early. Mo Shixiu, put me down.” Jiang Luoli wriggled in his arms, wanting to be put down.

“Don’t move.” Mo Shixiu frowned and hugged her waist tightly. “It’s very likely that our baby is already in your stomach.”Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m
