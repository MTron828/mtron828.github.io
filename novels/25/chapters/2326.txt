Chapter 2328: So This Hostility Was Because of Gu Sheng

He knew Bai Yusheng.

It was the name of a very famous director.

Not only that, but this name was also related to the Bai family in Yuncheng City.

A man with a rich family background, handsome looks, and talent…

This man was still single.

The man’s eyes were filled with hostility and fear.

He had to admit that Bai Yusheng’s condition was better than his in every aspect.

If such an outstanding man really had feelings for Gu Sheng, could she resist this temptation?

The man’s expression darkened.

Suddenly, as if he was declaring his ownership, he reached out and grabbed Gu Sheng’s arm.

Stunned, she looked up in surprise. “Brother Qin…”

Normally, Qin Mo would have already let go of her.

He had known Gu Sheng for three whole years and had always abided by the rules of etiquette. He was very respectful to this junior and had never taken the initiative to interact with her.

This was the first time he held Gu Sheng’s wrist.

He blushed when he met Gu Sheng’s surprised gaze, but he didn’t let go.

Qin Mo could feel Bai Yusheng’s gaze getting sharper, and his expression darkened. His cold and sharp gaze landed on the back of his hand as if he wanted to poke a few bloody holes in it. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He was now even more sure of his guess.

He and Bai Yusheng were meeting for the first time, and Bai Yusheng already showed deep hostility towards him.

So this hostility was because of Gu Sheng.

“Mr. Bai, you’re really funny.” Qin Mo’s voice was much colder than before. “Shengsheng has already told me that even though you’re her teacher, you’ve only taught her for a semester. In other words, Shengsheng and Mr. Bai are not familiar with each other. What’s Mr. Bai’s stand on?

“Don’t you think your words are too much?

“Moreover, whether Shengsheng came back for a blind date or is in a hurry to get married has nothing to do with you, right? Mr. Bai, aren’t you being too nosy?”

Qin Mo said what Gu Sheng wanted to say.

Although Gu Sheng was a little surprised, she didn’t say anything.

In Bai Yusheng’s eyes, she agreed with what Qin Mo said.

At that moment, Bai Yusheng’s anger burned in his heart, burning away all his rationality. Even his dark brown eyes were red.

At a glance, his eyes turned a terrifying scarlet red.

His brown eyes were lit up by the fire as he looked at the silent Gu Sheng and then at Qin Mo standing beside her. The veins on his forehead and on the back of his hand bulged. Even though he was extremely angry, he suddenly smiled.

“Good, very good.” He gritted his teeth and sneered. “It seems like I’m being too nosy.”

Gu Sheng frowned.

She felt that Bai Yusheng was a little too abnormal and scary.

He was like an enraged beast, ready to pounce on her at any moment.
