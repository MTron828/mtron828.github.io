Although she was already thinking of backing out, she still nodded. “Alright.”

...

Jiang Luoli had already guessed that he must be a rich and powerful man since he offered her 50 million yuan.

But when she followed Uncle Chen through a garden and two courtyards, she was still shocked by the huge mansion.

This didn’t look like a residential area.

It was more like a large forest park.

If Uncle Chen hadn’t brought her along, she would have lost her way.

She knew that man was rich.

But she never expected him to be so rich.

This was beyond her understanding. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

She followed Uncle Chen for about 10 minutes before he finally stopped outside a white building.

“Miss Jiang, Mister is waiting for you inside.”

Just as Uncle Chen finished speaking, a person walked out of the white building.

Jiang Luoli raised her head when she heard Uncle Chen call her.

When she saw that it was someone she hated, she frowned even more, and her expression darkened.

At the same time, Assistant Xu frowned when she saw her.

Neither of them gave each other a pleasant look. Their eyes were filled with disdain.

“Uncle Chen, it’s been hard on you. There’s nothing else for you to do here, go on with your work.”

“Yes.”

After Uncle Chen left, Assistant Xu sneered and said mockingly, “Miss Jiang is really capable. You managed to make our Mister unable to forget you in just one night.”

“I underestimated Miss Jiang.”

This wasn’t the first time Jiang Luoli heard him speak so strangely.

She could tell that Assistant Xu didn’t like her and thought that she was a scheming woman who deliberately seduced his boss.

He hadn’t been nice to her since the first time they met.

Jiang Luoli wouldn’t tolerate such a person.

She sneered. “Assistant Xu, I know you’re jealous. You think that I’ve stolen the man you like. That’s why you can’t help but say such sour words to me. But it’s useless no matter how jealous you are. From your husband’s performance that night, he wasn’t interested in men.

“I advise you to give up on this idea. It’s a tragedy to fall in love with a man you shouldn’t.”

Assistant Xu couldn’t react in time. After a few seconds, he widened his eyes, and he trembled in anger. “W-What nonsense are you talking about! Are you crazy? You actually said that I... have such feelings towards Mister! You lunatic, you’re full of nonsense!”

Jiang Luoli looked at him and sneered. “Isn’t it so? Assistant Xu is so hostile towards me, isn’t it because you have that kind of feeling towards him? You think I’m your love rival, so I can understand why you don’t like me.

“So, I can’t be bothered to argue with you.

“But I still want to give you a piece of advice. If you fall in love with a straight man, your relationship is destined to be a tragedy. You’d better give up now. It’s better to let it go quickly.”

Jiang Luoli was secretly happy to see Assistant Xu so angry.

She had long disliked this guy.

Every time she saw him, it was with that awful face of his.
