Chapter 252: As Precious as a National Treasure

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The black Rolls Royce drove smoothly.

Qiao Mianmian felt nervous again when they neared the Mo family’s old house.

She held Mo Yesi’s arm tightly. “Should I have bought some gifts? It’s my first time going to your house, it’s not a good idea to go empty-handed, right?”

When she said she wanted to buy a gift, Mo Yesi had said it was unnecessary.

But the more she thought about it, the more she felt like it wasn’t good to go empty-handed.

Even so, she didn’t know what gift she should buy.

People like the Mo family didn’t lack anything.

She would be too embarrassed to give ordinary gifts.

But she couldn’t afford gifts that would be unique to the Mo family.

“It’s not a bad thing.”

Mo Yesi could feel that she was tense along the way and sighed slightly. “Baby, just relax. You’re going to my house as a guest, not to war.”

Qiao Mianmian’s mindset seemed fit for a battlefield.

Her whole body was tensed up.

“I already told you that nobody will be hard on you. My parents are very open-minded, so as long as you’re someone I like, they’ll like you as well. Especially my grandma. There’s no girl in our family, so now that you’ve married into our family, you’ll be treated as precious as a national treasure.

“They’ll be rushing to fancy you, how could they be hard on you?”

“The Mo family doesn’t have girls?”

Qiao Mianmian was a little nervous after hearing him.

“Yeah.” Mo Yesi nodded. “My grandma has two sons, both of whom have boys. She has always wanted a granddaughter. With you in our family, my grandma will definitely adore you.”

“Oh right.”

He suddenly remembered something and hesitated a while before telling her in advance, “Shen Rou is also there. I just said that our family doesn’t have a girl, but the Shen and Mo families are like one. Thus, my mother has always liked Shen Rou and treats her as her daughter.

“They have a good relationship, so she came to see my Mom the moment she returned to China.

“Baby, I’m only bringing you back today, so my family isn’t familiar with you. Shen Rou has known my family for more than 20 years. So, if you feel like they’re more enthusiastic to her than to you, I hope you won’t mind.

“Just think of her as my sister.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Qiao Mianmian’s expression changed at the mention of Shen Rou.

Previously, she didn’t know that Shen Rou liked Mo Yesi, and hadn’t thought much of her as Mo Yesi’s childhood friend.

But now...

After knowing that this woman liked her husband, she felt like she didn’t really want to see Shen Rou.

This wasn’t out of jealousy.

Rather, she didn’t like the feeling of being regarded as a love rival.

But she couldn’t say these words.

After all, Shen Rou and Mo Yesi had met first and had even known each other for more than 20 years.

She couldn’t possibly tell them to break off their friendship just because he was now married.

“Yes, I understand.” Qiao Mianmian nodded and said obediently, “I’m not that petty, I can understand it.”

...

Another half an hour passed.

As the car drove halfway up the mountain, Qiao Mianmian saw a house some distance away.

In front of the house were two bronze squatting lions.

The carved gate was also bronze.

The majestic sight of the bronze lion sculptures were moving enough at one glance.

The Rolls Royce stopped slowly outside the gate.

The security guard at the door poked his head out, and Mo Yesi lowered down the window. The security guard saw his face and immediately greeted respectfully, “Second Young Master.”

Then, he opened the bronze gate.
