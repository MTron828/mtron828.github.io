Chapter 1507: Should We Wake Her Up Now?

Qiao Mianmian was the only artiste who had worked so closely with Bai Yusheng before.

The crew was discussing privately that Bai Yusheng pampered his cousin to the extreme.

She was like his own sister.

When Qiao Mianmian heard these discussions, she felt that it was different to have a director as a brother. Moreover, this brother was her current director.

She originally thought that Bai Yusheng was a very fair and impartial person.

Now she knew that even the most impartial person would still be biased towards someone.

...

Qiao Mianmian took the opportunity to shoot her new advertisement.

The commercial was shot at a resort.

Qiao Mianmian went with Xue Shiya’s crew.

Three hours later, they arrived at Hai Cheng.

Someone came to pick them up.

Qiao Mianmian and Nana took one car, while the rest of the crew took another.

The resort was in the suburbs and was a little far from the airport. They drove for more than two hours before reaching the resort.

When they finally reached their destination, the sky was almost dark.

The first day was to familiarize herself with the environment, and the second day started filming.

Qiao Mianmian was so tired from the three-hour flight and two-hour drive that she didn’t even eat dinner. After greeting the crew, she went straight to the room arranged for her to sleep.

...

“Young Master, Miss Qiao is already at the villa. I heard that she went to sleep without eating. Should we wake her up now?”

A black Bugatti drove into the villa.

After getting out of the car, the villa butler who came to welcome Gong Zeli reported Qiao Mianmian’s whereabouts.

In the night.

The man’s figure was slender, and his handsome features were tinted with a cold luster by the night sky, making him appear even more cold and threatening.

His eyes were cold too. Only when he heard the words “Miss Qiao” did he show some warmth.

The man strode quickly towards the white building.

“Since she’s already asleep, there’s no need to wake her up. Let her have a good sleep. Get the kitchen to work 24-hour shifts. If she’s hungry, make her anything she wants.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The butler looked up at him.

This resort was one of the Gong family’s many properties.

Gong Zeli didn’t come here often.

But the butler remembered that he had brought Young Lady Shen here before. At that time, he was very protective of her.

And all these years, besides Young Lady Shen, Gong Zeli had never brought another woman here.

This was the first time Gong Zeli took a woman other than Shen Rou so seriously. The butler was naturally shocked.

The butler felt that this wasn’t too surprising.

That girl surnamed Qiao was really too good-looking. If he was 20 years younger, even he might be tempted.

Of course, Young Lady Shen was also pretty.

But in comparison, the butler felt that Miss Qiao looked more pleasing to the eye.

Shen Rou looked... a little domineering.

Anyway, if it was him, he would rather like that girl with the surname Qiao.

He could see why Young Master Gong was attracted to her.
