Chapter 128: Watch Your Mouths in the Future

“If you’re jealous of her because of this, you’ve got no choice but to resign to it. Life isn’t fair.”

Bai Xiao’s expression darkened.

He heard all of it?

And he wasn’t angry with what Qiao Mianmian said? Instead, he was here to defend her?

“Mister, are a woman’s looks that important to you men?” Bai Xiao got agitated. “A pretty face trumps everything else? I thought you were different from other men. Who knew you were that superficial too!”

Superficial?

Mo Yesi narrowed his eyes as his lips curled up. “Who are you and how much do you know about me to think that I’m different from other men? And do you really think that your opinions are that important?”

He looked at Bai Xiao with eyes full of disdain. “A woman’s looks aren’t the most important, indeed. But a woman like you who’s ugly on the outside and on the inside is the worst. Any man would be disgusted.”

Bai Xiao widened her eyes.

Her face went red from anger and shame. “You...”

She had only uttered one word, but the ferocity in the man’s eyes kept her mouth shut.

The cold glare suffocated her.

Fear surged inside her as she felt a chill down her spine. She dared not go on.

He didn’t say nor do anything.

But the look in his eyes was intimidating enough. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Bai Xiao was practically trembling in that tense atmosphere.

Mo Yesi did not want to waste more time on a meaningless person.

He simply swept a cold glance at Zhang Yuwei, signaling his warning as he said, “Watch your mouths in the future. If I hear any other insults about my baby, I won’t just stop at a warning next time.

“If you want to ‘graduate’ early, you can try ignoring my words.”

His final sentence scared Bai Xiao and Zhang Yuwei out of their wits.

How could they not know what Mo Yesi meant by “graduate early”?

He had managed to make Shen Yueyue and Zhao Wanting face the consequences too.

They were afraid, but their hatred for Qiao Mianmian had only gotten deeper.

...

The two-bedder room was in another block.

Although they were in the same school, the students had very varied treatments.

Those staying in two-bedder rooms were usually more well-off.

After all, a semester’s worth of accommodation cost almost 100,000 yuan. Not every student’s family could afford it.

Two-bedder rooms had a suite-style design—two bedrooms, one living room, and one dining room. The best thing was that each bedroom had an adjoining washroom.

Moreover, the furniture and electronics were all provided.

“Wow, is this our new dormitory?”

Jiang Luoli’s eyes shone as she asked excitedly, “This is amazing. Baby, can we really stay here?”

“Of course.”

It was Mo Yesi who replied to her.

The man was holding the luggage in one hand and had his other arm around Qiao Mianmian. He looked around and said with a hint of despise, “Your school’s best room is just this.”
