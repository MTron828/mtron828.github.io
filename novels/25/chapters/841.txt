Chapter 842: Hand Over the Recording

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

But now that they’d found out, she had nothing to hide.

She had never been the one to hide things.

She smiled and walked out of the washroom.

She glanced at the two of them and said, “This place is a restaurant. Anyone in Yuncheng City can come here. Mr. Su and Miss Qiao, don’t you think your question is a little funny?”

Su Ze was stunned. His lips moved as if he wanted to say something.

But before he could, Qiao Anxin spoke. “Qiao Mianmian, you’re too low class. You actually eavesdropped on us.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but laugh. “I eavesdropped on you? Come on, can you not block others’ way? You’re blocking the door of the washroom, and you’re blaming me for eavesdropping?

“Do you think I really want to hear it? It’s all nonsense, why would I need to eavesdrop? Since you know that you’re in my way now, please make way.”

Qiao Mianmian looked at the two of them with undisguised disgust. “When I’m gone, you can continue whatever you want to say. Let me clarify again, I’m really not interested in the topic you’re talking about.”

What Qiao Anxin hated the most was the way she acted.

The thought of her conversation with Su Ze being overheard by Qiao Mianmian made her even more embarrassed.

Su Ze wanted to break up with her.

And Qiao Mianmian was actually involved in this.

Qiao Anxin had always been a competitive person. She didn’t want to fall behind Qiao Mianmian in any aspect and wanted to compete with Qiao Mianmian in every aspect.

The reason she’d taken Su Ze away from Qiao Mianmian was partly that she felt that Su Ze was a good catch, and partly because Su Ze was Qiao Mianmian’s boyfriend.

She felt a sense of achievement when she snatched him.

But now, Qiao Mianmian was with a more powerful man.

She naturally didn’t like Su Ze.

Qiao Anxin’s sense of superiority vanished.

She’d seen the scandal between Qiao Mianmian and Gong Zeli, and it made her even more certain that Qiao Mianmian was most likely involved with Gong Zeli.

The only Young Master of the Gong family was handsome and rich.

So many women in Yuncheng City wanted to be with him.

He actually managed to hook up with Qiao Mianmian.

No wonder she was so arrogant.

She felt that it was amazing that she had powerful backing.

She must have felt even smugger after witnessing Su Ze dump her.

The more Qiao Anxin thought about it, the angrier she got. “Qiao Mianmian, did you secretly record it? Are you trying to expose me and embarrass me?!

“You have to leave the recording before you leave!”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned for a while before realizing that Qiao Anxin was probably sick.

Wasn’t her imagination a little too rich?

If she hadn’t taken the initiative to provoke her, she wouldn’t have been interested at all.

“I didn’t record it.” Qiao Mianmian resisted the urge to roll her eyes. “Not everyone is as despicable as you. Can you move aside now?”

“Impossible.” Qiao Anxin stood still and glared at her. “If you didn’t record it secretly, would you have stood behind and eavesdropped for so long? Qiao Mianmian, I won’t let you leave until you hand it over.”
