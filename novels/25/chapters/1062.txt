Chapter 1063: There’s Nothing She Doesn’t Dare to Do Now

His heart was beating faster and faster. Seeing that the girl’s beautiful face was getting closer and closer to him, he pushed her with a flustered expression. “Miss Jiang, you’re really drunk.”

Jiang Luoli was so weak that she couldn’t even stand properly.

With Mo Shixiu’s push, she took a step back and almost fell.

Mo Shixiu immediately pulled her back.

Jiang Luoli threw herself into his arms and wrapped her arms around his waist.

Mo Shixiu dared not move.

His body stiffened as he looked down at the girl in his arms helplessly. He had one hand in the air, but he couldn’t put it down.

And he didn’t know how to deal with the woman in his arms.

He couldn’t even push her away.

He had to push her away...

Mo Shixiu stiffened.

After a while, he took a deep breath and pulled her hand away from his waist. He didn’t care if she was willing or not and forcefully led her out. “Miss Jiang, I’ll send you home.”

“I don’t want to go home.” Jiang Luoli started to struggle and cried like a child. “Mo Shixiu, I don’t want to go home. I want to see the stars on the mountain.”

“We’ll see the stars another day.” Mo Shixiu pursed his lips. At this moment, he just wanted to send this annoying girl home.

If he’d known that she’d be like this when she was drunk, he wouldn’t have let her touch alcohol.

The only fortunate thing was that she was with him now.

If it was any other man. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Mo Shixiu felt a little suffocated at the thought of her doing this to other men.

He felt a little uncomfortable.

“No, I want to see it now.” Jiang Luoli was so drunk that she had lost most of her consciousness. She didn’t say or do anything normally.
