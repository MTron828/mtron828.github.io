Chapter 805: You’re Scared Too

He could be so heartless and cruel to her.

“Mo Yesi, are you willing to give up anyone for Qiao Mianmian?” Shen Rou couldn’t help but shout. “You treat her so well. Have you ever thought that you’re nothing to her?

“You like her, but does she like you? She has a fiancé with 10 years of feelings for her. That’s the person she likes and cares about. No matter how good you are to her, what’s the point? Can you compare to their 10 years of relationship?

“She just broke up with her fiancé and immediately got married to you. Have you never thought that she’s only with you to treat her injuries? I did get the Internet Water Army to defame her previously, but I didn’t get her fiancé to reconcile with her on the streets.

“Maybe she rejected him on the surface, but her heart was moved. When her fiancé begs her a few more times, she might agree.”

Seeing that Mo Yesi’s expression was getting darker, Shen Rou felt a surge of joy. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The thrill of revenge.

He hurt her so much.

She wasn’t going to let him off easy.

She wanted him to have a taste of jealousy.

She wanted him to experience what it felt like to lose someone he cared about.

Even if he couldn’t fully understand her pain, even if he could only experience a tenth of it, it was enough.

“If a woman has loved a man deeply before, it’s very difficult for her to fall for another man. Just like me, hahaha. All these years, other men tried to get on my good side. But the place in my heart has already been filled up, how can I still hold others?

“Mo Yesi, do you really think that Qiao Mianmian can completely let go of her ex? Let me tell you, it’s impossible.

“Do you care a lot about her, and you’re afraid of losing her? But do you know that the more you love someone, the further away that person will be from you?”

Mo Yesi pursed his lips and asked, “Are you done?”

“Hahaha, you seem angry? Mo Yesi, so you’re afraid too. Did you actually think about what I said just now? Is that why you’re so afraid?

“You’re worried that Qiao Mianmian will get back together with her ex-fiancé, right?”

Seeing the anger and forbearance on the man’s face, Shen Rou was elated.

She could feel that Mo Yesi was afraid.

She felt that it was ridiculous and pathetic.

They’d known each other for so many years, but she’d never seen him afraid of anything.

But now, he was afraid.

Hahaha, just because she said that Qiao Mianmian would get back together with Su Ze and leave him, this fearless man was actually afraid.

What a joke.

She was just a woman.

She really charmed him.

She thought that he was different from other men.

It turned out that he was bewitched by beauty.

He was no different from any other man.

Crack.

At this moment, Wei Zheng entered.

The moment he entered the office, he felt that the atmosphere wasn’t right. He looked at Shen Rou, whose eyes were red and swollen from crying, and then at his boss’s dark expression. He cautiously called out, “Chairman Mo.”

Mo Yesi turned around and said coldly, “Bring her out.”
