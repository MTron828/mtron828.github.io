Chapter 1438: Let’s See What She’s Saying!

“Should we hold a banquet to announce Mianmian’s return to the Bai family, or...”

“Mianmian said it’s better to keep a low profile, so there’s no need to announce it to the public. But we can hold a smaller banquet and invite some friends and relatives. She’s busy with filming now, so let’s talk about this after she’s done.”

...

In a corner.

Madam Mo looked towards Madam Bai and Old Madam. She frowned when she saw how intimate Madam Bai and Qiao Mianmian were. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

She knew Madam Bai.

Hence, she was curious why Madam Bai and Qiao Mianmian looked so intimate.

They seemed to be chatting happily.

Madam Mo didn’t like Qiao Mianmian, no matter what she did.

In her opinion, Qiao Mianmian must have used some tricks to get Madam Bai to be so intimate with her.

Just like how she lied to her son and Old Madam.

She was so scheming and shameless.

Just as she was looking at Qiao Mianmian’s anger, Uncle Zhang walked up to her and said respectfully, “Madam, Old Madam wants you to go over. She said she has something to tell you.”

Madam Mo looked up and frowned. “Old Madam is looking for me?”

“Yes.”

“Did she say anything?”

“Old Madam didn’t say the details, but I think it has something to do with Second Young Madam.”

Madam Mo’s expression darkened.

“It has something to do with Second Young Madam? What exactly is it?”

Uncle Zhang smiled. “I’m not sure. Madam will know when she’s there.”

Madam Mo pursed her lips. After a few seconds, she suddenly sneered. “She must be trying to drive a wedge between Old Madam and talking bad about me. I’ll go over now and see how she’s going to gossip!”

With that, she got up and walked towards Old Madam.

Uncle Zhang couldn’t help but frown when he saw how angry she was.

He sighed.

How could Madam treat Second Young Madam so badly?

In fact, Second Madam was pretty good in other aspects besides her family background.

But Madam was someone who valued family background. No matter how good her family background was, she didn’t like it.

That would be Madam’s favorite Young Lady Shen.

Madam watched Young Lady Shen grow up and doted on her like a daughter. She had always hoped that she could marry Second Young Master and be her daughter-in-law.

But now?

Now that the Shen family had fallen, Madam wouldn’t like Young Lady Shen as much as before.

It was even more impossible for her to marry Second Young Master.

Madam’s liking was based on the fact that the Shen family hadn’t fallen yet and was still compatible with the Mo family.

Now, even if she still liked Young Lady Shen, the amount she liked had to be discounted.

But no matter how unhappy she was with Second Young Madam, they were already married.

And Second Young Master valued Second Young Madam so much.

If Madam refused to compromise and continued to reject her, it would only affect her relationship with Second Young Master.

...

“Old Madam, Madam is here.”

When Madam Mo went over, Old Madam and Madam Bai were talking about Qiao Mianmian’s future wedding.
