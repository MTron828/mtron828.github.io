His car was parked by the roadside.

After Qiao Mianmian got into the car with him, Mo Yesi didn’t drive off immediately. Instead, he sat in the car for a while and then took out his cell phone to make a call.

Qiao Mianmian heard him say coldly to the person on the other end of the line, “How are you dealing with that woman now?

“I don’t want to see her again.

“Mobilize the Mo Corporation’s legal team. Don’t let her out in this lifetime.”

Soon, he hung up.

Qiao Mianmian was shocked by his cold gaze and tone. She gulped and turned to look at him. “Mo Yesi, who did you call just now? Are you talking about Huang Yilin?”

Mo Yesi placed a hand on the steering wheel and narrowed his eyes. “Mm.”

“How... do you want to deal with her?” Qiao Mianmian was worried that he would do something illegal on impulse.

What he said just now sounded a little scary.

“She brought the acid to look for you because she wanted to destroy you if her career was ruined. She wanted you to go down with her. Such a woman is too vicious. I won’t give her a second chance to hurt you. I’ll get the Mo Corporation’s legal team to sue her for the most serious crimes. In the future, she’ll be in jail for the rest of her life.

“That’s the only way I can be at ease.”

Otherwise, Qiao Mianmian would be in even more danger the next time she had the chance to come out.

The consequences were unimaginable.

“You want the lawyer to sue her?”

“Mm.”

Qiao Mianmian heaved a sigh of relief.

Thankfully, he wasn’t trying to silence her.

It seemed like she was overthinking.

“What’s wrong?” Mo Yesi stroked her head. “Don’t you think this is enough? What do you want to do?”

“No, this is good!” Qiao Mianmian quickly said. “Leave everything to the lawyer. He can decide what to do.”

He could do whatever he wanted.

Mo Yesi narrowed his eyes coldly.

According to normal judgment, Huang Yilin still had a chance to come out.

How could he give this woman another chance?

Since he’d mobilized the Mo Corporation’s legal team, he couldn’t give this woman another chance.

Letting Huang Yilin stay in jail was a decision he made only when he was rational and calm enough.

But of course, he wouldn’t tell Qiao Mianmian this.

“Mm, leave it to the lawyer. Didn’t you say you haven’t had dinner? I’ll take you out to eat now. What do you want to eat?” Mo Yesi retracted his hand and started the car.

Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and felt that there wasn’t much she wanted to eat.

She asked, “Have you had dinner?”

“Not yet, I’m planning to eat with you.”

“Then, pick one that you like. I’m fine with anything.”

“I came over just now and saw a hot pot restaurant nearby. Don’t you like hot pot? I’ll take you there?”

“Hot pot?” Qiao Mianmian recalled the time he ate with her and vomited. She immediately dismissed the thought. “I ate hot pot with Luo Luo the last time I went back to Yuncheng City. Let’s change to something else.”

Mo Yesi didn’t think too much about it and thought that she really didn’t want to eat it. He thought for a while and turned the car into another street. “Then, let’s eat sweet and sour spare ribs. Didn’t you say you wanted to eat this? I promised to make it for you. I have time today, I can make it for you.”
