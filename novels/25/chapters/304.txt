Chapter 305: I Want to Skin Them Alive!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Even someone as gutsy as Jiang Luoli was taken aback.

Qiao Anxin usually looked sweet and nice. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

She didn’t seem the least bit aggressive.

This was the first time she witnessed Qiao Anxin’s other side.

And this first time was rather terrifying.

“Anxin, let’s go. Aren’t you going to the audition? It’s your turn soon, don’t be late for it. Director Bai doesn’t tolerate people who aren’t punctual.” Linda didn’t want Qiao Anxin to act on impulse and regret her actions later.

She had put in much effort to get funds and resources to groom Qiao Anxin.

As much as she was unhappy with her now, she didn’t want her own artiste to end up badly.

There was nothing to gain on her end if that happened.

Qiao Anxin took a deep breath and clenched her fist. “Qiao Mianmian, we’ll see who has the last laugh.”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t give a hoot about her and simply smiled. “Alright, I’m waiting for you.”

“You’ll regret this.”

Having spat her last words, Qiao Anxin walked past them and headed off.

Qiao Mianmian stood there for a few seconds before leaving with Jiang Luoli.

In the elevator.

Qiao Anxin’s expression darkened the moment the elevator doors closed.

She started yelling. “Slut! Who is she to be so arrogant in front of me. And that other slut Jiang Luoli. I’m going to skin them alive!”

Linda couldn’t help but wince when she saw Qiao Anxin’s menacing expression and tried to coax her. “Why stoop to their level? They’re doing all this to make you angry, so you’d do something ugly in public.

“If you really did it, you’d have fallen into their trap. She’s a nobody now while you’re a celebrity. If anything, you’re the one at a disadvantage if word gets out.

“You should know this very well.”

Qiao Anxin still had her fists clenched. “Of course, I know this. Why else do you think I’ve been swallowing my anger? Qiao Mianmian is a nobody. She’s in no position to be so arrogant in front of me!”

Was it all because of that mysterious man?

Was that why she’d become so arrogant?

Who exactly was that man?

Why was it that she was unable to find out his identity even after exhausting her resources and connections?

Was he really such an important and powerful person that he was under the radar?

She’d spent money to hire the best of private investigators, but there wasn’t even a clue or trace after days of investigation.

But if he really was that sort of person, how would Qiao Mianmian get to know him?

Wait, how did they even know each other?

There were so many questions in her head, and she was getting increasingly curious about this man’s identity and background.

“What’s there to be angry about.” Linda tried to appease her again and deliberately chose the right words. “She’s inferior to you in every aspect; she can’t even compare to you. If I were you, I wouldn’t waste my time and energy on someone as irrelevant as her.”
