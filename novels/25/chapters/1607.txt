Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Shangguan Qing’s eyes reddened from the pain. She looked up and was about to scold him when she saw that it was Bai Yusheng. Stunned, her eyes widened in shock.

“Brother Yusheng?”

Bai Yusheng frowned and said coldly, “Who are you, why are you shouting?”

“Brother Yusheng, it’s me, Qingqing. Shangguan Qing. Do you remember? We ate together.”

Shangguan Qing?

Bai Yusheng naturally had no impression of her.

But he had an impression of the Shangguan Family.

He stared at Shangguan Qing for a few seconds before letting go.

Upon gaining her freedom, Shangguan Qing immediately pointed at Qiao Mianmian’s nose and scolded her. “Brother Yusheng, is this shameless woman your actress? Get her to leave the set immediately and stop using her.”

Bai Yusheng’s expression darkened. “Shangguan Qing, watch your mouth. This is my set, no one is allowed to cause trouble here.”

“Brother Yusheng, are you bewitched by her? You’re actually speaking up for her. Do you know how shameless this woman is? Not only did she seduce you, but she also wants to seduce Brother Zeli. Brother Zeli is my man, how can I tolerate a shameless slut like her? If I don’t teach this slut a lesson, she won’t know her place.

“I don’t want to cause trouble on your set, but I have to teach this slut a lesson today.”

Shangguan Qing felt that something was wrong. She looked up and saw Bai Yusheng looking at her coldly.

She couldn’t help but shiver.

“Qiao Mianmian is my sister. Are you deliberately disrespecting the Bai Family by saying this to my face?”

Shangguan Qing’s expression changed. “Brother Yusheng, isn’t her surname Qiao? How could she be...”

“I don’t care what your relationship with Gong Zeli is. My sister isn’t interested in him. If you dare to slander Mianmian again and say anything bad about her, I’ll make you leave here crying. Also, don’t call me Brother Yusheng anymore. I, Bai Yusheng, don’t have a wild sister like you. Don’t try to get close to me.

“I have a sister, and she’s ten thousand times better than you.”

Shangguan Qing’s expression darkened.

She slowly turned around and looked at Qiao Mianmian. “The sister you’re talking about is her? Bai Yusheng, do you know that she...”

“Shut up.”

Bai Yusheng said sternly, “If you say anything bad about her, I’ll rip your mouth off.”

Shangguan Qing widened her eyes in shock and fear.

Bai Yusheng wasn’t a gentle and approachable person.

But he was very gentlemanly towards women. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Shangguan Qing couldn’t believe he would say such a thing.

Bai Yusheng turned around and instructed his assistant. “Call the security officers over and chase them out.”

They asked.

Hence, he wasn’t giving them any face.

Shangguan Qing’s face turned pale.

Soon, the assistant called a few security officers over.

Shangguan Qing yelled, “Bai Yusheng, you’re treating the daughter of the Shangguan Family like this because of a woman. I’ll definitely tell my dad about this and get him to tell your parents.

“Just you wait.”

Bai Yusheng replied coldly, “Go ahead.”

Then, he got the security officers to take her and the other woman away.
