Chapter 467: Mianmian, Is This Your Friend?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Yan Shaoqing looked confused. “She called me Third Yan?”

“Yes...”

“Damn!” Yan Shaoqing broke out in cold sweat right away. He seemed startled. “Is that my sister?!”

But, his sister didn’t have such a good voice.

Did his sister actually sound so sweet and gentle?

Why hadn’t he noticed it before?

Why did Yan Shaoqing immediately think it was his sister?

Well, because only a few people would call him Third Yan. Besides his grandma, mother, and Shen Rou, the only other female who would call him Third Yan was his sister.

The waiter had never seen the First Miss of the Yan family, but he could guess that the girl definitely wasn’t the Yan family’s First Miss.

Not her charisma, not her age.

“Young Master Yan, it’s a very young girl. I don’t think she’s First Miss Yan.”

“Not my sister?” Yan Shaoqing was even more confused now. “Then, who could it be?”

At this point, even Gong Zeli and Shen Rou were getting curious too.

...

The waiter led them out of their private room.

After knocking on the door, they heard a sweet girl’s voice coming from inside. “Come in.”

Music was playing in the room.

So her voice wasn’t so clear.

But Yan Shaoqing was already starting to have a bad feeling about this.

He felt that... this voice was a little familiar. He’d heard it before.

When the waiter pushed open the door, he was the first to enter. He stiffened the moment he saw Qiao Mianmian.

“S-Sis-in-law?!”

Gong Zeli and Shen Rou were shocked as well.

A few seconds later, Shen Rou turned towards Qiao Mianmian with a strange expression. She bit her lip and said, “So, it’s you.”

Shen Rou’s expression went a little cold as she recalled what happened in the revolving restaurant.

When Gong Zeli’s gaze met Qiao Mianmian’s bright eyes, a strange feeling came up inside him again.

“So, it’s you.”

Jiang Luoli stood up with an unpleasant expression the moment she saw Shen Rou. “Yuncheng City is too small. I’m just out for a singing session, and I managed to bump into the person I detest most. I wouldn’t have come here if I had known.”

Jiang Luoli had something against Shen Rou, especially after what happened at the revolving restaurant.

After learning more about Shen Rou and Mo Yesi’s relationship from Qiao Mianmian, she was even more annoyed by Shen Rou.

So what if this woman knew Prince Charming for a long time?

He ended up marrying her Baby instead.

If they were really good friends, she should have known to keep her distance from him. Even though they were good friends, it was only right to stay away from him, since he was already married.

And it was time for her to let go of whatever intentions she might have had.

Otherwise, she should at least keep it all in, and express none of it.

But that day at the revolving restaurant, she could tell that Shen Rou still had an interest in her Prince Charming.

What she felt towards Prince Charming was surely more than what a friend did.

Her best friend’s love rival was her enemy too!

Shen Rou was a rich Miss from a good background, and she’d been pampered and praised all her life.

Moreover, Yan Shaoqing and the group of guys had always taken good care of her, so she practically never had to feel upset or aggrieved.

And it wasn’t as if anyone dared to anger her, anyway.

Her eyes went cold as she clenched her fists. She took a deep breath and turned to Qiao Mianmian. “Mianmian, is this your friend? I don’t think I’ve offended her before. Didn’t she go a little overboard?”
