Chapter 96: Baby, I Was Once Young Too

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“I heard that Shen Yueyue and Zhao Wanting were expelled. Du Ze’s company also went bankrupt overnight. Did your male God do all that?”

Qiao Mianmian looked helplessly at her best friend.

Ever since Jiang Luoli saw Mo Yesi, she dubbed him as the new male God in her heart.

Amongst all the male Gods in her heart, he was number one.

Her male God had still been the popular teen idol, Tu Yilei just yesterday.

Her male Gods really changed so quickly at will.

“Yes, he did that.” Qiao Mianmian was close to Jiang Luoli and didn’t keep secrets from her.

“Wow.” Jiang Luoli placed a hand on her heart and exclaimed, obviously smitten. “My male God is too impressive. He’s the ultimate representation of a domineering president. He calls the shots and is absolutely obeyed. Shen Yueyue and her god-brother must be completely dumbfounded now. This ending is really too satisfying.”

Qiao Mianmian was quiet. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

She was about to say something when her phone’s ringtone sounded.

It was a message from Mo Yesi.

Mo Yesi: [Wei Zheng already booked a hotel for us tonight. Uncle Li will pick you and your friends up later. Ask them to order whatever they like, I’m treating.]

Qiao Mianmian stared at the message in a daze before replying: [You’re treating my friends to dinner?]

Mo Yesi: [Don’t you girls have such a rule?]

Qiao Mianmian: [What rule?]

Mo Yesi: [Whoever starts dating first has to treat the others to a meal. Aren’t your friends like that?]

Qiao Mianmian: [... How did you know we had a rule amongst us girls?]

Mo Yesi: [Baby, I was young once too.]

Qiao Mianmian almost laughed out loud at this reply. He made it sound like he was old, but he was in fact only twenty-five years old.

At this age, many were still studying in school.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but feel surprised that Mo Yesi would be so attentive to this matter.

She was also a little touched.

If a man cherished you, he would also care for the people around you.

Mo Yesi’s performance was exceptional in this aspect.

Be it towards Qiao Chen or her friends, he always showed respect and concern.

As for the meal, the girls didn’t have such a rule, but since he had already arranged it, she decided not to spoil his good intention.

“Baby, who are you chatting with? Is it my male God?” Jiang Luoli leaned over.

Qiao Mianmian immediately put her phone away and beamed. “Hey, your male God wants to treat us to a meal. Are you coming?”

“Yes, of course!” Jiang Luoli agreed instantly. “Is my male God bringing us to a high-end place? Should we dress formally? Ah, I’m suddenly so nervous and jittery. Baby, I’m afraid I will embarrass you if I don’t pull myself off well.”

Qiao Mianmian glared at her. “Nonsense!”

She turned and said to the other two girls in the bedroom, “Let’s go out for dinner, it’s my treat.”

The other two girls were not especially close to Qiao Mianmian.

But they all got along cordially.

Thus, they didn’t reject the invitation and nodded their heads. “Okay.”

Qiao Mianmian then sent a message to Mo Yesi and settled the time with him.
