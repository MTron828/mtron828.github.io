Chapter 45: There Will Be No Other Women Except Her

The beautiful young boy’s voice was a little timid.

Mo Yesi nodded. “Go ahead.”

Qiao Chen hesitated. “Brother, do you really like my sister?”

Mo Yesi was stunned. He didn’t expect him to ask this.

“Are you worried that I’m not sincere to your sister?” he asked, not really answering the question.

Qiao Chen hesitated again, and then he hurriedly said, “Brother-in-law has such good qualifications, so there must be many women who like you. Although my sister is beautiful, I don’t think brother-in-law has a shortage of beautiful women around you.

“Brother... Su Ze and my sister have known each other for a full ten years, but he still cheated on her. Sister has been hurt by him once, I don’t want her to be hurt anymore.”

Although Qiao Chen was a little afraid of Mo Yesi, for Qiao Mianmian’s happiness, he still gathered up his courage.

He squeezed his fist at Mo Yesi and gritted his teeth. “If you dare to disappoint my sister, I won’t let you go!”

Mo Yesi was still silent. Mo Yesi went quiet.

He was threatened for the first time in his life.

It turned out he was threatened by his own wife’s brother.

But Mo Yesi wasn’t angry.

He knew that they were in a good relationship, and Qiao Chen’s behavior was out of concern for his sister. He was afraid Qiao Mianmian would be cheated on.

After a few moments of silence, he smirked. “Do you want to hear the truth?”

The beautiful boy in the hospital bed clenched his fists. “Of course!”

Mo Yesi chuckled again and then said, “Your sister and I did not come together because of our feelings, so if you ask me if I like her, I cannot answer you.”

Qiao Chen frowned, looking a little angry. “You...”

“Is it important if I like her or not?” Mo Yesi raised an eyebrow. “As you said just now, didn’t Su Ze cheat on her even after ten years of a relationship?

“You steered your sister away and asked me so much because you’re worried that I would be the same as Su Ze, right? I can’t promise you that I will like her, but since I’ve chosen her, I won’t let her down.”

Qiao Chen froze, a hint of confusion in his eyes. “You mean...”

“Emotionally, I can’t guarantee it. However, what you worry about will never happen.”

Seeing the still confused face of the teenager, Mo Yesi got up and walked to the bed. He reached out his hand and patted him gently on his weak shoulder. “Qiao Chen, your sister is special to me. You can say that she is unique to me. The woman who will accompany me for the rest of my life will only be her, and there will not be another woman besides her.”

When Qiao Mianmian returned with the buns, Qiao Chen said that he had no appetite after eating one.

They talked for a while until Qiao Chen’s face became tired, then Qiao Mianmian got up and left after watching him fall asleep.

The night wind blew coolly on her face and felt very comfortable.

It took a few minutes for them to walk from the inpatient department to the gate of the hospital.

It was quiet all around.

Qiao Mianmian looked down at the shadows on the ground.

The figure of the man was more slender and could completely cover her shadow.

Qiao Mianmian looked a little fascinated. Without paying attention, she stepped on a small stone.

She slipped and her body fell forward.

“Ah.”

She yelped softly, seeing that she was about to fall to the ground. Suddenly, a strong arm wrapped around her waist and pulled her up firmly.

Qiao Mianmian hit the man’s warm and strong chest.

On top of her head, a low, deep chuckle sounded. “Is my shadow that good-looking? Even better than me?”L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎
