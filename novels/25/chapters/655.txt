Chapter 656: Chairman Mo... Are You Sure You Want to Eat It?

Qiao Mianmian picked up a braised egg and took a bite. She replied: [Snail noodles, super delicious.]

On the other side.

Mo Yesi was waiting for Wei Zheng to return with the food and saw her message. He immediately called Wei Zheng.

“Hello, Chairman Mo.”

“I canceled the takeaway. Go get a set of snail noodles now, I’ll have it for lunch.”

His wife said it was super delicious, so it must be really good.

Wei Zheng did not respond for a while.

Just as Mo Yesi was about to run out of patience, Wei Zheng’s trembling voice rang out again. “Chairman Mo, did you just say that you want to eat snails?”

“Is there a problem? Don’t tell me you can’t get it.” Mo Yesi sounded unhappy.

“Of course not,” Wei Zheng immediately replied. “But, Chairman Mo, are you sure you want to eat river snails? Do you know what they are?”

“Why?”

“It’s just that the taste is a little strange. Chairman Mo, if you haven’t tried it before, I’m afraid... you won’t be used to it. Moreover, it will cause your office to be filled with a strange smell for a long time. Chairman Mo... are you sure you want it?”

Half an hour later.

Wei Zheng returned with a bag of noodles.

He knocked on the office door and entered after getting permission.

The moment he entered, he saw Chairman Mo staring at his cell phone screen.

It was obvious... he was chatting with someone.

As for who he was talking to, it was even more obvious.

Moreover, he guessed that Chairman Mo’s unusual behavior today had something to do with the person he was talking about.

He’d been with Chairman Mo for years.

But he’d never seen Chairman Mo eat anything like this.

Chairman Mo probably didn’t even know what snail noodles were.

In order to keep up with his wife’s pace, he was going all out.

He felt that if Chairman Mo ever asked him to buy stinky tofu or fried skewers, he wouldn’t... be too shocked.

“Chairman Mo, this is the snail noodles you wanted.”

Wei Zheng took out the box and placed it on the desk. Before he left, he glanced at the box of shellfish powder on the table.

Should he... remind Chairman Mo again?

As a qualified assistant, he felt that he should.

Mo Yesi looked up at him. “Just say what you want to say.”

“Uh, Chairman Mo...” Wei Zheng pointed to the box on the table and tried to be tactful. “The moment the box is opened, you might smell something strange. I think... you should...”

“Get out.”

Before he could finish, Mo Yesi coldly asked him to leave.

Wei Zheng was speechless.

“Alright, Chairman Mo. I’ll take my leave first. Please let me know if you need anything.”

Before Wei Zheng left, he took another look at the box of well-closed snails on the table. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

He imagined Chairman Mo’s expression when he opened the box.

He’d eaten it before.

It tasted good.

But the smell was so strong.

The last time he opened a bag at home, his neighbor knocked on his door and asked if his toilet bowl had exploded.

What was worse was that the smell still lingered on for a long time.

Wei Zheng thought that Chairman Mo wouldn’t be used to it.

He couldn’t get used to it.
