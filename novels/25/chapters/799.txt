Chapter 800: Too Ugly

Wei Zheng was speechless.

Was this a suitable question?

He really wanted to say: Miss Shen, Chairman Mo is already married. If you want soup, Young Madam can make it for him. It’s not good for a friend like you to do this.

He could guarantee that Chairman Mo would never drink it.

Chairman Mo hadn’t even taken a look at the food that Shen Rou sent over previously.

“Haha, Miss Shen is so thoughtful.”

“It’s my duty.” Shen Rou smiled as if she didn’t hear the sarcasm in Wei Zheng’s words. “As long as Ah Si likes it, I can cook every day. I’m very happy to be able to do something for him.”

Wei Zheng was speechless.

You’re alright. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

But Chairman Mo and Young Madam are very close!

Why do you cook for a married man every day?

Isn’t it inappropriate?!

...

Outside the President’s office.

Wei Zheng knocked on the door and opened it.

He walked in first and looked at Shen Rou behind him. He coughed and said, “Chairman Mo, Miss Shen is here.”

Mo Yesi was sitting at his black desk.

He tapped his fingers on the keyboard quickly and replied without looking up. “Mm.”

“Miss Shen, take a seat yourself.”

Wei Zheng pointed at the sofa and was about to leave when he heard Mo Yesi stop him. “Book a restaurant suitable for a date tonight. Oh right, help me order a bouquet of pink roses. There’s no need to get too many, just 99 roses will do.”

Shen Rou had just sat down.

She stiffened.

If she hadn’t heard wrongly.

She heard Mo Yesi asking Wei Zheng to book a suitable restaurant for a date.

It was impossible to date a male client.

Hence, the person he was going to meet was definitely a woman.

He even got Wei Zheng to order flowers...

Which woman could make him take her so seriously?

Her expression darkened.

Wei Zheng glanced at her from the corner of his eye and smiled. “Is Chairman Mo going on a date with Young Madam?”

“What do you think?” Mo Yesi said calmly. “You’re asking the obvious. Besides your Young Madam, who else can I date?”

“That’s right, that’s right. I asked the obvious. I’m just curious about when Young Madam will be back. I’ll immediately go book the restaurant and get the flowers. Chairman Mo, don’t worry, I’ll settle everything properly and let you and Young Madam have a romantic date.”

Wei Zheng then glanced at Shen Rou.

Shen Rou’s expression was as dark as the bottom of a pot.

She was obviously furious.

Wei Zheng felt satisfied. He had said those words to agitate her.

She knew that Chairman Mo was married.

But she was still clinging onto him.

It was too ugly.

Even his assistant couldn’t take it anymore.

Initially, he had a good impression of Shen Rou. He felt that she was a beauty with a good background, good looks, and good manners.

But no matter how good this beauty was, once she had ill intentions, she wouldn’t be so good looking anymore.

Especially when Shen Rou wanted to ruin Chairman Mo and Young Madam’s relationship.

This was even more intolerable.

Chairman Mo and Young Madam loved each other so much, it wasn’t something she could easily ruin.

Chairman Mo probably didn’t ask her to come up because he wanted to catch up with her.

He must have sensed her thoughts too.
