“Weren’t they at the scene, too? Don’t you know what’s going on? Is there a need to wait for the truth?”

“Hahaha, I realized it too. I have a guess. I’ll wait and see if I’m right.”

“I also have a guess.”

“I also have a guess+1.”

After a while, the production team’s official Weibo also sent out an official reply and even released a video.

The netizens clicked on it and saw the video recording of Qiao Mianmian coming out of the room last night, all the way until the police arrested Third Chen.

Anyone who wasn’t blind could see that after Qiao Mianmian walked out of the room, she wasn’t in a mess. Her hair wasn’t disheveled and she didn’t look miserable.

She was wearing pink Peppa Pig cartoon pajamas. The style of the pajamas was a little conservative and covered her from head to toe.

When she walked out of the room, her expression was calm and composed.

Once the video was out, the Weibo post was confirmed to be a rumor.

The netizens all denounced him.

“This is too much. He actually used such a method to defame a girl. If Shen Fei, Zhan Bo, and the others didn’t stand up for Qiao Mianmian, without this video, she wouldn’t be able to clear her name.”

“The person behind this rumor is too evil.”

“I hope we can find this person soon.”

Once the official Weibo video was released, those who still had doubts about the leak were speechless.

This storm came and went quickly.

The program went on as per normal.

On the third day, the mission was to help the primary school students in the village cook a day’s worth of food. One team would be responsible for the lunch and the other team would be responsible for dinner.

After that, the students would score, and the group with the higher score would win.

Qiao Mianmian’s team was in charge of preparing lunch.

There were not many students in the village. Only about twenty.

This wasn’t a lot of work for Qiao Mianmian.

The key to this mission was not to cook for the students.

But the production team only took 50 yuan.

After receiving the purchasing funds from the production team, everyone was a little confused.

“Fifty yuan to make lunch for 23 children? Is there something wrong with the production team? How can we make lunch for more than 20 people with so little money?”

“With this amount of money, the five of us can’t even afford a meal. What can we buy? Buying half a kilogram of meat, I reckon each person can only get a little bit of minced meat.”

“They want us to buy meat with only 50 yuan? I don’t think we can buy many vegetables.”

“Isn’t this making things difficult for us? As expected, I was wondering why today’s mission was so simple. Looks like I was too naive. How could the production team be so kind!”

“This is insane!”

After complaining, they turned to Qiao Mianmian. “Mianmian, what should we do? Is this money enough?”

Qiao Mianmian was their backbone now.

The group of people stared at her, waiting for her to speak.

“Of course it’s not enough.” Qiao Mianmian held the 50 yuan in her hand and analyzed the situation. “If it’s vegetarian food, it should be barely enough. If there are meat dishes, it’ll be a little difficult.”

“But the mission stipulates that it must be two meat dishes and two vegetable dishes.”
