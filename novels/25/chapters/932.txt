Chapter 933: Are You Crazy?

It was indeed a signature store. The taste was really good.

“How is it, is it good?” Mo Yesi asked.

She swallowed the food in her mouth and nodded. “Mm, it’s pretty good.”

“If you like it, I’ll get it for you tomorrow morning as well.”

Qiao Mianmian knew that he wouldn’t leave F City for a while. “You really want to stay? Is your work alright?”

She was naturally happy that he stayed in F City.

The two of them were in their honeymoon period now. Even if she wasn’t the clingy type, she still hoped to be with him more.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

But she didn’t want to delay his work.

Mo Yesi didn’t answer her question. “You don’t want me to stay?”

“No.”

“So, you want me to stay?”

“... Mm.”

“Then, isn’t it good for me to stay with you?”

“But won’t it affect your work?” She blinked. “Although I really want you to stay, if it affects your work, you’d better go back.”

He had just taken over the Mo Corporation.

He had to do many things himself.

“Baby, you’re more important than work.” The man looked at her with his deep eyes and said gently, “Since you want me to stay, then I’ll stay. As for my work, you don’t have to worry. I’ve already made arrangements, it won’t affect anything.”

“Alright.” Qiao Mianmian was relieved to hear that.

...

After breakfast, they headed to the hospital together.

When they arrived at Tu Yilei’s ward, Qiao Mianmian heard a commotion coming from behind the closed door. It sounded like Tu Yilei and his manager were arguing about something.

Tu Yilei’s voice was a little cold. “I know what to do about my own matters. Michael, you’re just my manager. We’re partners outside and friends in private. Aren’t you being a little too nosy?”

“I care too much? If you don’t make me worry, do you think I want to control you? I know you don’t like it when I try to control you, but what did I tell you before? If you’d listened to me, you wouldn’t be lying here now.

“Yilei, wake up. Do you know how much we’ve lost because of this? I’ve talked to my partners many times about VK’s endorsement, and it wasn’t easy to get it. Do you know how many people were competing for this endorsement back then? They were all A-list celebrities, and their qualifications weren’t inferior to yours.

“It was all good. It wasn’t easy to get this endorsement deal, but it’s going to be ruined because of your injury.

“It’ll take at least a year or so for your hand to recover. Do you think they’ll wait that long?”

After a moment of silence, Tu Yilei spoke again. “If they can’t wait, then terminate the contract.”

“Terminate the contract?” Michael raised his voice. “Are you crazy? If we take the initiative to terminate the contract, do you know how much it’ll cost?”

“Even if we don’t bring it up, they will. You said it yourself, I can’t shoot an advertisement now, they won’t be waiting for me.”

“That’s easy for you to say.” Michael was so angry that his voice shook. “Other than the VK endorsement, the other endorsement deals you’ve done can’t be shot, and they have to be terminated. Just the termination fee alone is an astronomical figure.

“I’m afraid all the money you’ve earned in the past few years is going to go to the termination fee.”
