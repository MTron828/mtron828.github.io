“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian nodded. “That’s right. So, you don’t have to be sad about their breakup.”

They had never really been together, nor did they break up.

“So, I was happy for nothing.” After knowing the truth, Madam Bai said sadly, “I was still thinking that your brother finally has a girlfriend and there’s hope for him to get married. When he gets married, I won’t have to worry about his marriage anymore.

“But it tums out that everything was fake. I thought Tang Ya was a very nice girl and told your dad that we could rest assured if your brother was with her. I didn’t expect her to be targeting the Mo Family.”

“Mom, when Brother has someone he really likes in the future, he’ll definitely bring them home for you and Dad to see.” Qiao Mianmian held her mother’s hand and comforted her gently when she saw how upset she was. “Fate can’t be forced. Perhaps Brother’s destined person will appear soon.

“At that time, he might just get married quietly.”

Madam Bai was not comforted. She sighed with a worried expression. “When he has someone he truly likes, it’ll be too late.”

“Not at all, not at all.” Qiao Mianmian felt that she had to give Madam Bai some hope. After some thought, she lowered her voice and said mysteriously, “I think Brother might already have someone he likes.”

Madam Bai’s interest was piqued. “Did your brother say something to you?”

“He didn’t say anything. However, I saw him arguing with a girl with my own eyes. It seems like their relationship isn’t ordinary.”

Madam Bai’s eyes lit up. “When did you see it? Where did you see it?”

“Ata charity banquet.”

“Then, did you see the girl?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Yeah, I saw her. She’s pretty and classy.” Qiao Mianmian had a good impression of Gu Sheng and was full of praises for her. “You’ll definitely like her.”

“You’re not lying to me, right? Did you really see your brother arguing with someone?” Madam Bai’s mood improved after hearing this, but she was afraid that Qiao Mianmian was just trying to comfort her.

“Mom, I’m really not lying.” Qiao Mianmian raised her fingers. “I swear, I really saw it.”

“Okay, okay. Why are you swearing? I believe you.”

A smile finally appeared on her face, and she did not look as upset as before. “With your brother’s character, he won’t randomly argue with girls. So, his relationship with that girl is definitely not ordinary.

“Mianmian, do you know that girl’s name?”

Madam Bai couldn’t wait to know the identity of the girl who was close to her son.

“Name? Let me think…” Qiao Mianmian tilted her head and searched through her memories. After a while, she remembered. “I think her name is Gu Sheng. Oh right, I heard she’s a very famous painter.”

“Gu Sheng, a painter…”

Madam Bai secretly remembered this name.

If this girl was really a famous painter, it would be easy to find her.

The day after Qiao Mianmian returned to her parents’ house, Mo Yesi couldn’t hold it in anymore.

According to the rules, both parties were not allowed to meet a few days before the wedding.

Qiao Mianmian was taken care of like a treasure by her parents in the Bai Residence, and she ate and slept soundly, without any discomfort..
