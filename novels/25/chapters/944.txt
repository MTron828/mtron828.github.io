Chapter 946: Is It That Actress Qiao Mianmian?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Sister Shen, why don’t we stop playing after this?” A young lady who was on good terms with Shen Rou looked at her worriedly. “You’ve already drunk a lot. You’ll get drunk if you continue drinking.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Shen Rou wiped her lips and said expressionlessly, “I’m not drunk, continue playing.”

“Sister Shen, you...”

“Ah, Tu Yilei is actually quitting the entertainment industry temporarily and going overseas to study for a year.” The young lady playing dice with Shen Rou suddenly exclaimed. She then held her cell phone and complained. “Why is he suddenly going overseas to study?

“He didn’t even tell me about this.”

The other girl smiled and said mockingly, “Maybe he decided to go overseas just to avoid you. What if you stop him from leaving?”

“Bullsh*t.” The elegant young lady burst out in anger. “What has it got to do with me? Someone said that something happened to him, that’s why he suddenly decided to go overseas.”

“And it’s actually related to the vixen he was rumored to be with.”

“Damn it, what exactly did that vixen do? I heard that she has a backing, so she became the female lead instead of the third female lead. Could it be that she bullied Tu Yilei with her backing and forced him to seek refuge overseas?”

“No, I have to call Tu Yilei and ask him what’s going on. If it’s really that vixen who’s up to no good, I don’t care about her backing. I’ll teach her a lesson.”

Shen Rou looked up at the woman sitting opposite her. “What did you say? Tu Yilei is going overseas to study?”

Even though Shen Rou wasn’t very concerned about the entertainment industry, she knew Tu Yilei.

The most popular young hunk had only signed Bai Yusheng’s show and was in the same crew as Qiao Mianmian.

The young lady replied indignantly, “Yes, he’s really popular now. If it wasn’t for some reason, he wouldn’t have gone overseas for a year.”

“You just said that his trip has something to do with the female lead? Is it that Qiao Mianmian?”

“Ah, Rourou, you know this vixen too?” The young lady on the other end said angrily. “It’s this vixen. I don’t know where she came from. She was only the third female lead, but now she’s the female lead.”

“Maybe she was the one behind Huang Yilin’s incident. Otherwise, why would she become the female lead?”

Shen Rou’s eyes flickered. “What has this got to do with her? How do you know it’s because of her?”

“How would I know if it has anything to do with her? I only heard about it online. But there’s no smoke without fire. If it wasn’t really related to her, why would there be such rumors?”

Shen Rou kept quiet for a few seconds before logging into Weibo.

On Weibo, it was filled with topics related to Tu Yilei’s year-long overseas study.

Shen Rou clicked into Weibo and saw Tu Yilei’s post.

She checked the comment section again.

The reply from the netizen called “Hottest Ethnic Trend” was pushed to the top of the trending comment section. After Shen Rou read her reply, she pursed her lips and thought for a while before clicking on his homepage and sending him a private message.
