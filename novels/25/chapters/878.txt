Chapter 879: I Won’t Accept Your Apology

But thinking of her motive for coming here today, she held back her hatred and greeted Qiao Mianmian. “Miss Qiao, can I talk to you?”

Qiao Mianmian looked at her expressionlessly. “I don’t think we have anything to talk about.”

When had Huang Yilin ever been bullied by a newbie?

She wanted to flare up on the spot, but she wasn’t blinded by anger and knew why she was here today.

She took a deep breath and clenched her fists. “Miss Qiao, I’m here to apologize to you. I was in the wrong previously, please forgive me, alright? I was too impulsive and did something bad to you. Actually, I regretted it and wanted to apologize to you.

“In any case, I hope you can forgive me this time. I know you’re magnanimous and kind-hearted, and you won’t hold it against me. I…” Huang Yilin held back her shame and hatred and recited the script that her manager had prepared for her.

She said she knew she was wrong.

But there was no remorse in her eyes.

The hatred in her eyes was deep.

She hated Qiao Mianmian as much as she did.

If it wasn’t for her career, how could she apologize to this slut?

She had never hated anyone in her life.

But now, she hated Qiao Mianmian.

She wanted this slut to die immediately.

Because of her, she was now a joke in the eyes of many.

She was like a rat on the street, hated by everyone.

The producers’ wives would surround her every day, scaring her so much that she didn’t even dare to return home. She’d been changing hotels for the past few days.

When had she ever been so pathetic?

It was all because of Qiao Mianmian.

She had just exposed a scandal, and this slut wanted her dead.

“Miss Huang, I think you’ve made a mistake.”

Looking at Huang Yilin’s unrepentant eyes, Qiao Mianmian smiled and said coldly, “I’m not magnanimous at all, and my heart isn’t kind at all. So, I’m afraid I’ll have to disappoint Miss Huang.

“I think there’s a good saying. If an apology is useful, why do we need the police? I’m afraid I can’t forgive Miss Huang.”

Qiao Mianmian knew very well what would happen if someone like Huang Yilin forgave her.

She couldn’t possibly admit her mistake, nor would she be grateful for her forgiveness.

She would only hate her even more.

Qiao Mianmian saw the hatred in her eyes when she apologized.

Someone who hated her had to lower his head and apologize to her. Huang Yilin probably hated her even more now.

Since she couldn’t change her hatred, why should she be a saint?

Moreover, if she forgave Huang Yilin, everything Mo Yesi did for her would be in vain. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Huang Yilin widened her eyes in disbelief. “What did you say?”

Qiao Mianmian looked straight into her eyes and said word by word, “I don’t accept your apology. Just as Senior Tu said, if no one helped me, I might have been done for because of that scandal. Just a casual apology from you, and I have to forgive you and pretend nothing happened?

“Also, Miss Huang is someone who has won the Best Actress Award before. Even if you’re unwilling to apologize, you should at least show some sincerity when doing so. Why force yourself when you’re so unwilling?”
