Chapter 1239: When Did She Say That?

Sweetpea Pancake: “Pure passerby. It shows that she has no resistance to men who work seriously. After the appraisal, although we can’t see his face from this angle, he’s definitely handsome. And his figure is also very good. I think I see chest muscles.”

Heizi naturally had to criticize everything he saw: “What’s so handsome about him? He doesn’t even dare to show his face and only knows how to be secretive. Even if he isn’t 1.65m, even if he isn’t an old man, he definitely isn’t good-looking. Have you guys never seen a man before, being smitten with a man whose face can’t be seen?”

In the past, Qiao Mianmian’s comment section was full of negative comments.

He was very successful.

But this time, the haters neglected something.

Women were usually harsh to women, but this didn’t mean that they were equally harsh to men.

On the contrary, women had always been very tolerant of men.

Hence, as soon as the haters appeared, they were attacked by Mo Yesi’s fans.

These fans were very powerful. They were hired by the haters.

Not long after, the haters were surrounded by a large group of fans and didn’t dare to appear anymore.

Even if they did, they were quickly dismissed by the fans.

The comment section was strangely peaceful for the first time.

Qiao Mianmian was in disbelief.

She slowly raised her head and looked at the man still flipping through the documents seriously. For the first time, she felt how powerful the so-called “male looks are.”

She hadn’t even made Mo Yesi look good, and he already had so many female fans.

If he showed his face one day...

Qiao Mianmian suddenly felt a strong sense of danger.

No, she had to hide Mo Yesi!

She didn’t want those people to see what he looked like.

Perhaps the possessive look in her eyes was too strong. The man seemed to sense it and slowly looked up.

The moment their eyes met, Mo Yesi seemed a little stunned.

A few seconds later, he closed the document and the laptop on the table.

He then got up and walked towards her.

“I’m sorry, I neglected you for too long.”

He obviously misunderstood Qiao Mianmian’s gaze. He walked to her side and pulled her up.

Before Qiao Mianmian could react, the man pinched her chin and kissed her.

“Mm...”

Qiao Mianmian only struggled a little before closing her eyes.

Ten minutes later...

She leaned against his chest, panting.

The man’s breathing seemed more stable than hers.

But Qiao Mianmian could clearly hear his heartbeat. He wasn’t as calm as he looked.

“Mo Yesi, what are you doing? Are you done with your work?” Qiao Mianmian finally caught her breath. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The man’s fingers gently caressed her soft cheeks. “Didn’t you want me to kiss you?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

When did she say that?

She suddenly recalled the way Mo Yesi looked at her...

Did he think she was asking for a kiss?

Qiao Mianmian thought about his performance and actions and felt that he must have misunderstood.
