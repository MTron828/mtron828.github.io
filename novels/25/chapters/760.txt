Hence, this jealous lover had acted strangely.

Did he... do it on purpose just now?

Qiao Mianmian found his declaration amusing.

Could he be any more childish?

Qiao Mianmian quietened down after finding out why he was acting so oddly.

After realizing that Tu Yilei had feelings for her, she felt that this was a good opportunity.

This was too childish.

But... if Tu Yilei really had some feelings for her, it was about time he gave up.

When Qiao Mianmian saw Tu Yilei behind her, Tu Yilei’s gaze landed on her too.

Their eyes met for a few seconds. Tu Yilei’s usually gentle and approachable face darkened as he pursed his lips.

He stood rooted to the ground. His brown eyes seemed to be filled with emotions, but after a while, they calmed down.

He turned around and returned to the car.

The man looked down at the girl whose lips were swollen from his kiss. His slender and fair fingers slowly caressed her red and tender lips, and his eyes revealed a strong desire to possess her.

Qiao Mianmian saw Nana running towards her excitedly the moment she entered.

Nana grabbed her hand and asked excitedly, “Sister Mianmian, do you already know?”

Qiao Mianmian blinked in confusion. “Know what?”

“About Huang Yilin.”

“Huang Yilin?” Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “What about her?”

“You still don’t know?” Nana looked at her in shock. After a few seconds of silence, she looked even more excited. She lowered her voice and whispered, “Someone exposed Huang Yilin. They said that she was a receptionist at a high-class clubhouse before her debut.

“And there are photos of her working there.

“Not only that, they even revealed that she used underhanded means to get to where she is and slept with the producers and investors. Moreover, some pictures and facts also revealed their names.

“Do you know that most of the producers and investors she slept with are married? A few investors even still have that sort of relationship with her. I heard that their wives went to look for her when this news was released. They said they wanted to teach her a lesson.

“Huang Yilin was so scared that she didn’t even dare to come to the set today.

“Weibo is in chaos right now, but Huang Yilin’s management company has already made their move.”
