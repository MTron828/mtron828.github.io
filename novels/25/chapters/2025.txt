Chapter 2028: I Can Treat You to Anything You Want

“I won’t, I won’t.” Qiao Mianmian immediately promised. “I promise I won’t. Next time, no matter what it is, I’ll reject it.”

“Can you keep your word? Can I trust you?”

“Of course. Hubby, you should trust me more. Am I so untrustworthy in your eyes?”

Mo Yesi asked, “What do you think?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I think you should believe me.” Qiao Mianmian snuggled into his arms and sat on his lap. She hooked her arms around his neck and looked at him with soft eyes. “This time, count it as me skipping the appointment. To express my apology, I’ll treat you to a meal tomorrow night, alright?

“Call Shaoqing and the rest along.

“I haven’t seen them in a while.”

“You’re treating me?”

“Mm, I’ll treat you.” Qiao Mianmian had a huge amount of savings and a lot of real estate now. She felt that she could afford to treat him to even the most expensive meal.

Mo Yesi raised an eyebrow. “What do you want to treat me to?”

“Anything.” Qiao Mianmian patted her chest and said generously, “I can afford anything you want.”

“Mm, you can afford anything?”

“Of course.” Qiao Mianmian smiled and said smugly, “I have a lot of savings now. No matter how expensive the meal is, I’ll be fine.”

“So, I can eat anything I want?”

“Yes.”

“…” Qiao Mianmian looked at the man in front of her speaking seriously but wasn’t serious at all. She didn’t know what to say.

Mo Yesi was really thick-skinned sometimes.

“Alright, go and see your visitor.” Qiao Mianmian pushed him. “Don’t make her wait too long.”

…

In the living room.

“Chairman Mo.”

The woman heard the commotion and turned around. Her heart raced as she saw Mo Yesi walk in.

She tugged at her clothes nervously.

Mo Yesi nodded at her and found a seat.

Then, in a business-like tone, he said, “Have you edited my proposal?”

“Chairman Mo, it’s all been edited. Please take a look.” The woman suppressed her uncontrollable emotions and handed him the proposal.

When Mo Yesi reached out to receive it, the woman’s eyes landed on his slender and fair fingers, and she couldn’t help but be moved.

Even his hands were so beautiful.

Mo Yesi took the document and flipped through it for two minutes before placing it on the table.

“Let’s follow the plan.”

The woman looked happy. “Chairman Mo, do you think this plan will pass?”

“Mm.”

The woman couldn’t help but look smug.
