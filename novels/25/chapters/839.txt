Chapter 841: Qiao Mianmian, Why Are You Here?!

Qiao Anxin was getting increasingly agitated. “But Su Ze, do you think that Qiao Mianmian will forgive you and return to you just because you broke up with me?”

“What nonsense are you talking about?” Su Ze was a prideful person, so he got angry when she exposed his thoughts. “Qiao Anxin, I didn’t pursue the fact that you lied to me because of our past relationship, so I wanted to break up with you peacefully. If you know what’s good for you, let’s talk about the breakup calmly. I’ll give you some benefits due to our past relationship.

“But if you don’t have any self-awareness and are unwilling to share, then don’t blame me for being heartless.”

“Su Ze, are you threatening me?” Qiao Anxin asked.

Su Ze’s eyes were so cold that Qiao Mianmian felt like he was a stranger.

He didn’t look like the Su Ze she’d known for the past 10 years.

His voice was cold too. “If you think it’s a threat, then it’s a threat. You lied to me for so long and forced me to break up with Mianmian. I haven’t even settled all these debts with you.

“Qiao Anxin, you’d better be smart.”

At this point, Su Ze’s gaze turned even colder. “I’m not discussing with you now, I’m just informing you of my decision. You should know what will happen to you if you anger me.

“If you want to continue in the entertainment industry, listen to me. Otherwise...”

Qiao Mianmian was shocked when he said “Otherwise”.

Su Ze looked a little menacing now.

His face was still the same.

But it was as if a different soul was inside him.

It was terrifying.

Qiao Anxin was probably shocked too and didn’t make a sound.

Su Ze was afraid that someone would see him and Qiao Anxin, so he looked around and saw Qiao Mianmian.

He was stunned for a moment before shock filled his eyes.

“Mianmian...”

He couldn’t believe it and thought that he was hallucinating. He rubbed his eyes and looked at her again.

“It’s really you.” Seeing that Qiao Mianmian was still standing there, it wasn’t his illusion. He was shocked and pleasantly surprised. “Mianmian, w-why are you here? When did you arrive?”

When he guessed that Qiao Mianmian had been standing there for a while, his expression changed slightly. He quickly calmed down and tried to explain to her. “Mianmian, what did you hear? Just now, Anxin and I...”

“Qiao Mianmian, what are you doing here?!”

Su Ze’s voice was drowned out by an even sharper voice. Qiao Anxin turned around and was even more shocked and surprised to see Qiao Mianmian standing behind her.

Qiao Mianmian had never thought of eavesdropping.

But the place where they were talking was in her way.

She’d planned to leave after this adulterous couple left.
