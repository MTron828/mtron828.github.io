Chapter 562: I Will Never Detest You

“Enough, don’t say anymore, just don’t!” Shen Rou suddenly screamed as if she’d completely lost it. She wrapped her arms around her head and sobbed in agony. “Gong Zeli, don’t say anymore. I don’t want to hear it, please don’t go on.”

How could she not understand it?

She knew it all.

But she was just indignant.

She was the one who had been with him for the longest time, the one who understood him the best and loved him the most.

She was obviously the better choice for him.

But why couldn’t he even give her a chance?

Why did he have to be so cruel to her?

“Rourou, there’s no use avoiding reality.” Gong Zeli looked at her sadly. He sounded less cold and heartless now. “Ah Si is married. He is someone’s husband now and has his own family.

“You can’t continue clinging to him.

“Rourou, don’t turn yourself into someone so pathetic. Let go, don’t waste any more time on him.”

He actually wanted to ask her, was there no one else in her eyes beside Mo Yesi?

He also... had liked her for many years.

Did she not feel it at all?

He wasn’t as outstanding as Mo Yesi, and he’d done absurd things before. Perhaps, he was also a man she wouldn’t see as loyal.

It was true that he was much of a playboy sometimes.

But if she was willing to accept him, he could change for her. He could be loyal and devoted too.

She could be the only woman around him in the future.

But he knew that she wouldn’t even care for it.

She wouldn’t care for whatever he was willing to do for her.

“No!” Shen Rou’s head suddenly snapped up, and she looked at him with anger and stubbornness in her eyes. “Why do I have to let go, why should I? I’ve liked him for 20 years, not for him to end up marrying another woman.”

Gong Zeli frowned as his eyes darkened. “What do you want, then? You’re going to force him to get a divorce? Shen Rou, can you be more rational. The choice is in Ah Si’s hands, not yours.

“Don’t make things so ugly. Otherwise, all of us can’t even be friends anymore. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Is this what you want?”

“Zeli, you also think that the way I cling to him looks terrible?” Shen Rou bit her lip as tears rolled down her cheeks. “Are you starting to detest me too?

“Didn’t you say that you’d always be on my side? Are you starting to regret it now?”

“No, I’m not...”

Gong Zeli’s expression stiffened for a while and then softened when he saw her tears.

This was the woman he liked.

She was devastated.

He shouldn’t be this fierce to her.

He had once said that no matter what happened, he would always be her safe haven, protecting her from the world outside.

“Rourou, don’t cry anymore.” Gong Zeli sighed and then pulled her into an embrace, wiping tears off her face. “I was too harsh just now.

“How could I possibly detest you. You know very well that I...” He paused and then broke into a self-mocking smile. “I will never detest you.

“Whatever I said before will count forever.”

Shen Rou grabbed onto his collar and cried her heart out. “Ah Li, will you help me? I love Ah Si so much, I can’t do without him. If I can’t be with him, my life would lose all meaning.”
