Chapter 2560: Become… a Vegetable?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“She knows how much I care about you, but she still hurts you time and time again. I don’t have any friendship with such a person anymore. If you ask me if I’ll be sad if she dies, my answer is no.

“Be more selfish. If she really dies, I might be relieved. In the future, I won’t have to worry about her harming you behind your back.”

Qiao Mianmian was a little shocked.

She didn’t expect Mo Yesi to think this way.

“Baby, do you think I’m too heartless?” Mo Yesi saw the shock in her eyes and asked gently.

He was never a good person.

Besides the people he cared about, the lives of others had nothing to do with him.

He didn’t care if others said he was cold, cruel, or heartless.

The only thing he cared about was how she looked at him.

“No.” Qiao Mianmian shook her head.

How could she think that he was heartless?

Moreover, whether he was heartless to others had nothing to do with her.

It was enough as long as he was good to her and the people she cared about.

And he did.

He loved everyone she cared about.

“That’s good.” Mo Yesi smiled and said gently, “As long as you don’t think I’m heartless, it doesn’t matter what others think of me.”

Mo Yesi’s cell phone rang.

When he picked it up, Qiao Mianmian saw that it was Yan Shaoqing.

Mo Yesi picked up the call. “What is it?

“No.

“It has nothing to do with me. You don’t have to call me anymore. That’s it, I’m hanging up.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The call ended in less than two minutes.

After Mo Yesi hung up, Qiao Mianmian asked, “Shaoqing called you? Why did he say? Is it because of Shen Rou?”

“Mm.” Mo Yesi threw his cell phone aside and didn’t hide it from her. “He said that Shen Rou was rescued, but her condition is still critical. Her life is still in danger. Moreover, the doctor said that her brain suffered a serious blow. It’s still unknown if she can wake up.”

Qiao Mianmian thought about it and came up with many meanings.

Especially the last sentence.

“Brain damage? She might not be able to wake up?” She bit her lip and repeated this sentence. She thought of a possibility and her expression changed slightly. She asked hesitantly, “Can I understand this as Shen Rou might become… a vegetable?”

“Exactly.” Mo Yesi confirmed her guess. “If she doesn’t wake up, she’ll be in a vegetative state.”

Although she knew what he meant, Qiao Mianmian still felt that it was too terrible.

She didn’t like Shen Rou.

But if Shen Rou really became a vegetable, it would be too terrible.

It was better to die in peace.

“Shaoqing wants you to go to the hospital?” Qiao Mianmian asked again.

“He said that he wanted me to visit Shen Rou. But I rejected him.”

Qiao Mianmian knew that.

She was standing beside him when he spoke to Yan Shaoqing.

“Mo Yesi.” Qiao Mianmian blew Mo Yesi’s hair until it was 80-90% dry. Then, she turned off the hairdryer and walked to him from behind the sofa.. She reached out and wrapped her arms around his neck, sitting on his lap.
