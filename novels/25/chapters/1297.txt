Chapter 1299: Did Someone Look for You at School Today?

All her life.

Nothing would change this.

Hence, she couldn’t accept it if anything happened to Qiao Chen.

“But...” Qiao Mianmian started to worry again.

“Mm? What else do you have to worry about?” Mo Yesi wiped the tears off her face gently with a handkerchief.

Qiao Mianmian blinked. “Second Madam wanted Chen Chen to die in the past. Now that she knows he’s still alive, she won’t let it go, right? Even if she doesn’t succeed this time, it’s hard to guarantee that she won’t harm him in the future.”

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t willing to call her Second Aunt.

This woman almost killed Qiao Chen. In Qiao Mianmian’s eyes, Second Madam was an extremely vicious and evil woman!

Although she was unhappy that Second Master Mo had an illegitimate child, Qiao Chen was still a baby.

The child was innocent!

But she was able to harm a baby. It was obvious how vicious she was.

She couldn’t be any kinder to Qiao Chen, who was now a young man.

Qiao Mianmian was really worried about Qiao Chen’s situation.

“No matter what she thinks, she won’t get her way.” Mo Yesi didn’t want her to worry anymore and promised her. “Mianmian, trust me. I’ll get someone to protect Chen Chen. If you’re really worried, let Chen Chen acknowledge his roots and ancestors, then he’ll be safer.”

“Let Chen Chen acknowledge his ancestors?” Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

“Mm.” Mo Yesi explained to her seriously. “Second Aunt is most worried about Chen Chen acknowledging his ancestors. She and Second Uncle don’t have children, so she groomed a nephew from her family to work in Second Uncle’s company. If Chen Chen returns to the Mo family, Second Uncle’s company will definitely be taken over by him in the future.

“This is a threat to her and her nephew.

“So, she definitely doesn’t want Chen Chen to acknowledge his roots and ancestors. But if Chen Chen returns to the Mo family and officially becomes a member of the family, she’ll be more or less afraid. Our family doesn’t allow siblings to kill each other. Once we find out, anyone will be severely punished.

“But this is just my suggestion. Whether Chen Chen is willing to return to the Mo family depends on his own wishes.”

Qiao Mianmian was silent for a while before nodding. “I’ll tell Chen Chen your suggestion. It’s up to him to decide.”

...

Although Mo Yesi said that he had someone protecting Qiao Chen, Qiao Mianmian was still worried.

Mo Yesi accompanied her to Qiao Chen’s school.

After the siblings met, Mo Yesi found an excuse to leave and let them talk alone. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Qiao Mianmian held Qiao Chen’s hand and looked him up and down carefully. Only then was she completely at ease.

Qiao Chen looked at her expression and asked, “Sister, what happened? Isn’t Brother-in-law at work? Why are you...”

“Chen Chen, did someone come to school to look for you today?” Qiao Mianmian interrupted him and asked seriously.

“No.” Qiao Chen looked at her serious expression and felt that something must have happened. Moreover, it was related to him.

It definitely wasn’t a good thing.

Otherwise, his sister and brother-in-law wouldn’t have come to school at this time.

He hesitated for a while before asking, “Sister, what happened?”
