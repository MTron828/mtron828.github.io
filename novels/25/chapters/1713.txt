Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“How is a show that makes my baby suffer good?” Mo Yesi grabbed her hand and squeezed it. “I can’t bear to see you suffer. If you want to participate in a variety show with good ratings, I can help you find another one. You’d better reject this one.”

“But I really want to go. I don’t think it’s a big deal.” Qiao Mianmian wasn’t willing. “I think it’s interesting to experience different lives occasionally. I’ve seen this show before. I think it’s really interesting to experience life in the countryside.

“And it’ll feel good to earn my living expenses.

“Mo Yesi, I really want to go.

“Just let me go, alright!

“I promise I’ll take good care of myself.”

Qiao Mianmian hugged his arm and shook it as if she would keep going until he agreed.

Mo Yesi was speechless.

“Mo Yesi, let me go, alright? Hubby, I know you’re the best. I really want to go. Let me go.”

Qiao Mianmian shook his arm for about a minute, and Mo Yesi had no choice but to agree.

Qiao Mianmian jumped up happily and hugged his neck. She lowered her head and kissed his handsome face twice. “I knew you were the best, Hubby. Then, I’ll call Sister Xie now and tell her that I’m going to attend that show.”

They had been apart for a while.

Mo Yesi was a normal man during their wedding period. It was said that absence made the heart grow fonder. He was no exception.

He reached out and pulled her into his arms. He pinched her chin and said in a low voice, “Baby, is this your gratitude? Aren’t you being too perfunctory?”

Qiao Mianmian looked up and met the man’s dark eyes. Her heart started racing.

Her face grew a little hot. She bit her lip and said softly, “Then, how do you want me to thank you?”

Mo Yesi’s eyes darkened. He didn’t say anything and carried her horizontally.

He turned around and headed upstairs.

Qiao Mianmian looked at the untouched table and got a little anxious. “Mo Yesi, dinner...” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“No rush, we have more important things to do.”

...

The next day, Qiao Mianmian slept until two in the afternoon before she finally got up.

Her legs were still shaking when she got out of bed.

After washing up, she dragged her soft body downstairs.

Lei En immediately got someone to prepare lunch for her. Qiao Mianmian ate her usual two-person meal alone before finally filling her stomach.

Lei En stood at the side and was shocked to see her eat so much alone.

It seemed like absence made the heart grow fonder.

Young Madam was exhausted.

He just didn’t know when to expect a Young Master or a Little Miss.

“Young Madam, are you full? Do you want me to get the kitchen...”

“No need, I’m full!”

Qiao Mianmian wiped her lips with a napkin and touched her bulging belly. She got up and said, “Make me a cup of tea, I’ll digest it.”

“Alright, I’ll get it ready right away.”

Lei En left quickly, and the housemaids came over to clean up the table.
