Chapter 1944: She Still Likes Him

After filming “The Meaning of Traveling” finished, Qiao Mianmian returned to Yun Cheng.

She told Mo Yesi about her flight and he went to the airport an hour earlier to wait.

At the airport.

Mo Yesi entered the VIP lounge to wait for Qiao Mianmian’s flight.

He picked a corner with fewer people and asked for a magazine from an employee before quietly flipping through it.

The man had an outstanding appearance.

His handsome features, noble aura, and extraordinary dressing made it hard for people not to notice him.

Even though he had chosen an inconspicuous corner to avoid attracting attention, many girls in the VIP room still kept looking in his direction.

Someone wanted to ask him for his contact number, but was repelled by his cold aura and did not dare to look for him again.

Mo Yesi’s patience and gentleness were only for Qiao Mianmian.

Without Qiao Mianmian around, he didn’t seem gentle at all. He seemed cold and distant.

Others wouldn’t dare to approach him easily.

Just like the girls in the VIP room, no matter how much they coveted him, they only dared to sneak a few glances or take a photo with their phones.

No one dared to look for him.

Mo Yesi had been reading the magazine for about ten minutes when a shadow fell over him. A familiar voice followed. “Ah Si, long time no see.”

Mo Yesi looked up and saw a woman standing in front of him. He glanced at her coldly before looking back at the magazine.

His reaction was so cold that Shen Rou’s face immediately darkened and she clenched her fists.

She looked at Mo Yesi with hatred instead of infatuation.

She hated this heartless man.

Because of him, the Shen family almost went bankrupt.

When she needed help the most, when she was at her lowest, he ruthlessly rejected her begging.

Twenty years of friendship meant nothing to him.

For Qiao Mianmian, he just watched as the Shen family went bankrupt.

He knew that once they went bankrupt, she would have a miserable life in the future, but he was still indifferent.

He really didn’t take her seriously at all.

But all these years, she loved him to the core.

Compared to his coldness and ruthlessness, Shen Rou felt that her efforts over the past twenty years were like a joke.

Fortunately, she was no longer that foolish.

“Ah Si, must you be so cold to me?” Shen Rou didn’t care if Mo Yesi listened to her. She smiled and said, “I never thought that we would become enemies one day.

“I thought that no matter what, we’d still be friends. Now that I think about it, I was too naive.

“Ah Si, Dad told me that you promised him that you would help the Shen family. But the prerequisite was that I get married within a month. Is that true?” Shen Rou knew the answer, but she still asked.

She wanted to hear Mo Yesi admit it himself.

This way, she could slowly give up on him.

She had liked this man for more than twenty years.

Even if she was utterly disappointed in him now, her feelings for him would not disappear completely in a short period of time.

She still liked him.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

However, she wouldn’t allow herself to be foolish again.

Her focus in life would no longer be Mo Yesi.

Mo Yesi looked up and said coldly, “Since you know, what else is there to ask?
