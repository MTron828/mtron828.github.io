Chapter 332: It’s True, She Isn’t Speaking Nonsense

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

When she went to practice at the dance studio a while back, the instructor even complimented her on her great figure and body ratio.

“That’s right. Prince Charming, Mianmian looks skinny, but she’s actually very fleshy! No, that’s not the right way to say it. She’s actually not fleshy, she simply has flesh at the most suitable parts!

“Don’t underestimate her based on how she looks usually. She wears a C cup, you know!”

“Luo Luo!”

Qiao Mianmian blushed a bright red. She got up and covered Jiang Luoli’s mouth.

“Ah. Baby, what are you covering my mouth for. I already said what I needed to. Anyway, even if I hadn’t, Prince Charming would’ve known too!” Jiang Luoli gave a suggestive smile as she tried to evade Qiao Mianmian’s hand. “Ah... Actually, I think Prince Charming is even clearer about it than I am. After all, you guys have already... hehehe.”

“Jiang Luoli, shut up!”

Seeing how Jiang Luoli’s words were getting dirtier, Qiao Mianmian was abashed and frustrated all at the same time. She wanted to rip Jiang Luoli’s mouth out.

But a strong arm grabbed her and pulled her back.

She staggered back into the warm, sturdy chest of the man, and he wrapped his arm around her.

The man’s low voice and ticklish breath were right by her cheek. “Baby, is Jiang Luoli speaking the truth?”

At that moment, Qiao Mianmian’s face went even redder.

“D-Don’t listen to her nonsense.”

A few seconds later, she heard him chuckle.

He whispered very quietly, such that only she could hear him. “I took a quick check just now. Based on my first judgment, she’s not speaking nonsense.”

“Mo Yesi...” Qiao Mianmian glared at him. “Y-You pervert!”

“I’m a pervert? How’s it perverted to look at my own wife?”

The man gave a sly smile.

Hints of cheekiness could be seen in his grinning eyes.

His current demeanor was very different from the usual.

He seemed like a completely different person.

Qiao Mianmian was a little shocked, but also pleasantly surprised.

Mo Yesi was extremely handsome, to begin with. Even with the cool and distant expressions he usually put on, women still fell head over heels over him.

But now that he smiled, he was even more captivating. Those looks alone could drag one’s soul along.

Even Qiao Mianmian, who was already his wife, was awestruck.

She couldn’t help but get excited.

Until... she heard a teasing chuckle. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Baby, is your husband that good-looking?” The man looked down at her with those gentle eyes and tenderly swept some of her hair behind her ears.

Right then, he saw the girl in his arms blush. Her cheeks turned red, and so did her ears, and then her neck.

With her eyes widened, she looked exceptionally adorable.

Next to them, Jiang Luoli could only see that Mo Yesi and Qiao Mianmian were whispering to each other, but she couldn’t hear them.

She had no idea what he’d said that made her Baby blush so much and glare at him once in a while. But in any case, they seemed sweet and blissful together.

That sort of bliss made Jiang Luoli feel warm and fuzzy inside.

Back when Qiao Mianmian was still with Su Ze, she’d never been envious or felt anything like this.

But now...

Seeing how much this man pampered her Baby, she suddenly felt that being in love was such a wonderful thing.

It’d probably feel nice to have someone to pamper her this way too.
