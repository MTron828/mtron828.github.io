Chapter 1059: Can My Words Please You?

She didn’t believe that he’d thought of this himself.

Either someone was teaching him behind his back, or he was lying to her when he said he’d never been in a relationship.

“Of course. Miss Jiang, please ask. I will answer truthfully.”

“Mr. Mo, did Assistant Xu teach you what you said just now?” If that was the case, Assistant Xu was really good at flirting.

“No.” Mo Shixiu looked at her and replied seriously, “The date tonight was planned by Assistant Xu, but every conversation between Miss Jiang and I was my own idea. It has nothing to do with anyone else.”

“Really?” Jiang Luoli was in disbelief. “But didn’t Mr. Mo say that you’ve never been in a relationship?”

“Yes, is there a problem?” Mo Shixiu was puzzled.

Jiang Luoli said, “... Mr. Mo, I don’t think you’ve never been in a relationship before.”

Mo Shixiu was even more confused now. “Why do you think so, Miss Jiang? I’m not lying to you. Before you, I’ve never dated another woman in private. If you don’t believe me...”

“Alright, alright, I believe you.” Jiang Luoli felt that he wouldn’t lie. How could a man like Mo Shixiu lie to a woman?

This wasn’t something he would do.

She just felt that he was too good at flirting.

He was so good at flirting that he didn’t seem like a man with no experience in relationships.

“Miss Jiang, why do you think I lied to you?” Mo Shixiu was very insistent on finding out the answer. “Did I do something wrong that made you think this way?”

“No...”

“Miss Jiang, you can tell me directly where I haven’t done well.” Mo Shixiu said seriously, “I know I still have a lot to learn, but Miss Jiang, you have to tell me where I haven’t done well. Only then will I know how to correct it.”

“Mr. Mo, you really didn’t do anything wrong. It’s just that I don’t think you’ve never dated before.”

“Why?” Mo Shixiu was confused. “Miss Jiang, why do you think that?”

Jiang Luoli took a deep breath. “Mr. Mo, don’t you know how alluring your words are? Those words... don’t sound like they come from a man who’s never been in a relationship.

“Your words only make others think that you have a lot of emotional experience.”

Mo Shixiu frowned. “Why?”

Jiang Luoli placed a hand on her forehead. “Only men with rich experience in relationships are good at flirting.”

“Flirt?” Mo Shixiu frowned. “What do you mean?”

Jiang Luoli was speechless.

“Mr. Mo, don’t you know what flirting means?”

Mo Shixiu shook his head and asked humbly, “Miss Jiang, can you explain to me what flirting is?”

Jiang Luoli was speechless.

Were they living in the same era??

At his age, he actually didn’t know what “flirting” meant.

She kept quiet for a while as she met his humble gaze. “Mr. Mo, ‘flirting’ means making girls happy and saying things that can move them.”

Mo Shixiu understood what she meant. He looked at Jiang Luoli and asked seriously, “Miss Jiang, you said that I’m good at flirting. Do you mean that I can make you happy? Can my words make you happy?”
