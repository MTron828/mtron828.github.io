What was this man thinking?

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

His hand bled so much and had such a deep cut. It must hurt so much.

But instead of thinking about how to recuperate, he kept thinking about that.

Someone actually said that he was a male god.

How did he look abstinent!

…

Qiao Mianmian only had time to pay attention to what happened to Song Fei after she returned to Lu Shan Courtyard.

Song Fei was completely ruined.

Everyone knew about her scandals.

Especially about her school violence and about her injuring a baby, many netizens paid close attention to her and strongly condemned her.

She had an affair with a married man. Even if it was considered a scandal, it was nothing compared to the other two scandals.

Although the former was shameless, they were, at most, morally criticized.

It had to be known that there were several cases of married artistes having an affair. Although they were also strongly criticized by the netizens, they only kept quiet for a while. Later on, they participated in some variety shows to establish a likable persona and clear their names.

But someone like Song Fei wouldn’t be able to clear her name.

The impact of the last two incidents was too terrible.

It’d be unforgivable even if she was an ordinary person.

However, Song Fei was a public figure.

Moreover, the girls who were bullied by her in school all posted on Weibo as well.

It was impossible for Song Fei to deny it.

The reporters also found the baby who was injured by Song Fei. Although the baby survived, her brain was damaged, so she became a fool.

In the video.

The baby’s parents were crying pitifully.

“My poor Nannan was less than a year old back then. She just came to this world, she was still so young, she didn’t know anything. Who knew that such a crazy devil would do that to my Nan Nan?

“I thought children were pure and kind, but how could there be such a vicious child? No, she’s not a child, she’s a devil. My Nan Nan wasn’t even one year old, what could she do to her? Why would she do that to my Nan Nan?

“Because of her, Nan Nan’s life was ruined. The doctor said that her brain injury is irreversible. My Nan Nan is going to be like this for the rest of her life. Nan Nan, why is my Nan Nan’s life so tough?

“Reporters, have you found that little devil? Tell me who she is! I want to find her. I want to ask her face to face why she did that to my Nan Nan. She caused my Nan Nan to be like this, why can she live a carefree life!

“How is our family going to survive this? Why did God let us meet that little devil? Why did God let us live such a bitter life?”

The woman’s eyes were red and swollen as she cried out her grievances and despair.
