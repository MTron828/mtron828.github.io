Chapter 820: Thinking of Someone Jealous

“It was a coincidence.” Qiao Mianmian immediately clarified. “I didn’t even know he was on that flight, much less that he was beside me.”

Linda kept quiet for a while before saying, “I believe you. This is just a coincidence. But now, someone took photos of you and your interactions. Young Master Gong’s public clarification on Weibo has already made many people doubt your relationship.

“This time, the two of you were on the same flight and coincidentally got together again.” Linda paused for a while before continuing, “That person posted the photo on Weibo. Now, the netizens are discussing your relationship with Young Master Gong.

“Initially, public opinion was already moving in a good direction. But now, with the scandal between you and Young Master Gong, the public opinion is disadvantageous to you again.” Linda sighed. “You’ve been involved in too many scandals recently. Although it has been clarified that it has nothing to do with you, it will inevitably make others think that your team is deliberately trying to hype you up.

“Also, we found out that a bunch of haters is always slandering you. Once you appeared on the news, they immediately took action and attacked you in the comments section.

“I wonder if the person who posted this is really a netizen or someone with ulterior motives. Think about it carefully, who did you offend?”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned for a long time.

Who did she offend?

She had never offended anyone.

But every time she didn’t take the initiative to find trouble with others, she still couldn’t escape from them.

If she had to say who she offended.

She felt that she had offended too many people.

Someone who had the money to hire the Internet Water Army to defame her must be very capable.

She thought for a while and thought of three people.

Qiao Anxin, Shen Rou, Huang Yilin.

These people were the most likely.

Among them, Shen Rou and Qiao Anxin were the most likely.

Huang Yilin was also embroiled in scandals and couldn’t even protect herself. She probably didn’t have the mood to defame her anymore.

Qiao Mianmian made some guesses in her mind.

“Sister Xie, do I need to post on Weibo to clarify this?” Qiao Mianmian had a headache. She was already mentally and physically exhausted from the recent scandals.

She didn’t expect that.

She was only on the same flight as Gong Zeli, but she could still be photographed and used for scandals.

“Not for now.” Linda thought for a while and said, “Let those haters continue their antics so we can find out where they came from. The scandal this time is related to Young Master Gong. Although it might affect you negatively, it’s not without benefits.”

“Benefits?”

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t figure out how her scandal with Gong Zeli would benefit her.

“Mm, you’ve already had a scandal with Young Master Gong before. With this scandal, many people will think that you and Young Master Gong have a close relationship. In the future, no one will dare to do anything to you. This will avoid a lot of trouble.”

Linda’s words were vague, but Qiao Mianmian quickly understood.

Linda was referring to the unspoken rules in the industry. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Once she got involved with Gong Zeli, many people would be afraid to touch her.

This was indeed a good thing for her.

But...

Qiao Mianmian thought of a jealous lover and nodded.
