Chapter 2106: Her Attitude Is Too Warm

Qiao Mianmian was busy the next two days.

Recording songs, Father Qiao’s birthday, Qiao Chen’s college entrance examination, and a few other things.

Thankfully, the recording went smoothly. It only took her a day to finish recording both songs.

She didn’t have to make any changes to the details.

On Father Qiao’s birthday.

After Qiao Mianmian and Qiao Chen agreed to come, she followed Mo Yesi to Qiao Chen’s school and picked him up.

The day after Father Qiao’s birthday was the college entrance examination.

Qiao Chen had always been outstanding in his studies, and Qiao Mianmian had never been worried about him.

Qiao Chen himself was also confident. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

But even so, Qiao Mianmian was still worried about tomorrow’s college entrance examination.

She asked him, “Chen Chen, are you ready? How confident are you in tomorrow’s exam? Have you thought about which school you want to go to?”

Qiao Chen smiled and nodded. “Mm, I’m ready. As for the school, I think T University is pretty good.”

“T University?” Qiao Mianmian looked surprised. “Didn’t you always want to go to F University? Why do you want to go to T University now?”

F University was Qiao Chen’s ideal university.

He’d told Qiao Mianmian more than once that he wanted to go there in the future.

Hence, Qiao Mianmian was shocked when she heard that he wanted to apply for T University.

“Mm, I wanted to apply for F University previously, but I feel that T University suits me better now. T University is better in terms of financial management.”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t think too much about it.

University T and F were very good key universities. No matter which school Qiao Chen went to, it was a good choice.

“Mm, think about it yourself.” Qiao Mianmian nodded. “Although we’re very confident, you can’t let your guard down. You have to take this exam seriously.”

“Sister, don’t worry. I will.”

Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and said, “I’m rather free tomorrow, I’ll accompany you to the examination hall.”

Qiao Mianmian valued her brother’s college entrance examination.

Everyone else was accompanied by their parents.

Qiao Chen only had his sister.

Although he had been acknowledged by the Mo family, he was still a little distant from them.

“Sure.” The young man smiled. “With Sister by my side, I’ll definitely perform exceptionally well.”

…

A while later, they arrived at the Qiao family’s house.

Qiao Mianmian was surprised to see Lin Huizhen waiting outside.

Lin Huizhen smiled and walked towards them.

“Mianmian, Chen Chen, you’re finally back.” Lin Huizhen had argued with Qiao Mianmian before, but she didn’t feel awkward now. Even if Qiao Mianmian didn’t smile at her, she still smiled.

She said affectionately, “Your dad, Anxin, and I have been waiting at home. Oh, Yesi is here too. It’s rare for you to have the time to come despite being so busy. How thoughtful.”

Lin Huizhen was both happy and afraid to see Mo Yesi.

She didn’t know his identity before.

Now that she knew, her attitude was naturally different.

The man standing in front of her was the Chairman of the Mo Corporation, the Second Young Master of the Mo family.
