Chapter 2813: Help Me Investigate Someone

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“I know this speculation is a little ridiculous, but she really gives me the same vibe of Qiao Anxin. But her voice is completely different. So, I don’t know if I’m overthinking it.”

Linda kept quiet for a while before saying, “Since you have such speculations, we have to find out whether it’s true or not. If she’s Qiao Anxin, then it’s too dangerous for her to participate in the same show with you. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“What if she’s up to no good? She’s in the dark while you’re out in the open. You can’t guard against her.

“Moreover, looks can be changed through plastic surgery, and so can voice. So, even if her voice is different from Qiao Anxin’s, it doesn’t mean anything.”

“Sister Xie, don’t you think I’m overthinking?” Qiao Mianmian was a little surprised that Linda didn’t think that she was overthinking. After all, she felt that her guess was a little ridiculous.

“It’s said that a woman’s intuition is very accurate. I believe you won’t suspect someone for no reason. Moreover, you and Qiao Anxin grew up together, so you must know her very well. Even if she changed her appearance and voice, someone familiar with her would definitely be able to discover something.

“Qiao Anxin left the entertainment industry because her reputation was ruined and she couldn’t survive in the industry anymore. But I still feel that she won’t be so willing to leave. If she wants to return to this industry, it’s possible by changing her appearance.

“Mianmian, the more I think about it, the more worried I get. You have to be careful. If she’s Qiao Anxin, your situation is really worrying. The most important thing now is to investigate her identity and background. I suggest you tell Chairman Mo about this immediately.

“If it’s him, we’ll be able to find out soon.”

A moment later, Qiao Mianmian hung up.

Linda suggested that she tell Mo Yesi about it, but Qiao Mianmian decided against it.

She didn’t want him to worry about her.

But this should be investigated as soon as possible.

Qiao Mianmian was also worried that a venomous snake might be lurking around.

Qiao Anxin hated her to the core.

When one hated another to the core, they could do anything.

After some thought, Qiao Mianmian sent Bai Yusheng a WeChat message.

Qiao Mianmian: [Brother, I have something to ask of you.]

Bai Yusheng was probably looking at his cell phone. He replied immediately: [Little girl, you finally remember that you have an older brother? Why are you so polite? Tell me, what’s the matter?]

Qiao Mianmian: [Help me investigate someone.]

Bai Yusheng: [Who?]

Qiao Mianmian: [A newbie called Jiang Xinyue. She’s on the show with me this week. Don’t ask me why I’m investigating her. Just do a good background check on her. I want detailed information about her in the past few years.]

Bai Yusheng: [What’s so mysterious that your brother doesn’t need to know the reason? But can you tell me, is this very important to you?]

Qiao Mianmian: [Mm, it’s very important.]

Bai Yusheng: [Alright, since my precious sister asked me, I’ll check it out for you immediately. Is it alright to give you the details today?]

Qiao Mianmian: [No problem. Brother, thank you. I knew you were the best. I’ll treat you to a meal when we get back.]

Qiao Mianmian sent another cute emoji.

Qiao Mianmian also acted cutely.

Although her brother didn’t have to give her any benefits, it was still necessary to act cute and sweet.
