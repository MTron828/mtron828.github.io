Chapter 456: This Newly-Appointed Chairman Su Was Pretty Heartless

Su Ze was very clear about one thing.

Whether or not Mother Su got someone to lie to him, he couldn’t possibly fall out with his biological mother. He’d always been a filial son, and he would continue to be one.

Moreover, Qiao Anxin wasn’t important enough to him to warrant such a huge change.

Between Mother Su and Qiao Anxin, he was clear who meant more.

Su Ze stood outside for a while more and saw Qiao Anxin’s new manager walking towards him.

The new manager was called Huo Lin.

Huo Lin stopped before him and greeted, “Chairman Su.”

Su Ze nodded in acknowledgment.

Huo Lin looked into the ward and hesitated. “Miss Qiao...”

Su Ze narrowed his eyes. “Isn’t conscious yet. What is it?”

He didn’t mention the miscarriage.

But several people saw Qiao Anxin bleeding from between her legs and would possibly speculate.

Huo Lin saw that Su Ze wasn’t intending to bring it up and hence did not probe further. She was here for other reasons, anyway.

Not to visit Qiao Anxin.

“Chairman Su, are we not going to handle the news of Miss Qiao on Weibo? It’s already the top search online. If this goes on, Miss Qiao’s reputation is going to be very badly affected. She signed the contracts for a few upcoming commercials. If this isn’t cleared up in time, the brands might drop her.

“If that happens, we’d be the one to have to pay the compensation fees.”

The contracts always included a clause that said the brands had the right to drop the artistes if they were involved in any forms of negative news that might adversely affect the brands’ image. When that happened, the artistes would have to bear the compensation costs.

The brands that Qiao Anxin signed contracts with were not particularly big ones.

But if every one of them required compensation, it’d be a huge sum.

Su Ze hadn’t intended to settle this since he had thought that Qiao Anxin lied to him.

He didn’t think of clearing Qiao Anxin’s name for her.

He even thought of letting Qiao Anxin’s career go down the drain just like that.

But now that he was full of guilt, he felt that he had to do something to make it up to her.

He thought about it for a while before saying to Huo Lin seriously, “Issue a public declaration saying that the person behind the post is Linda. Linda took the opportunity to send the post to the forum when Anxin wasn’t aware. When the company found out, we fired Linda right away.”

Huo Lin’s expression changed when she heard that.

She and Linda were on pretty good terms.

They were both top-tier managers of the company.

She already knew that Su Ze fired Linda because of Qiao Anxin, but she never expected him to make Linda the scapegoat.

He was too much. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

In any case, Linda was a long-time employee of Star Splendor, and she’d made a huge contribution to the firm.

To kick someone to the curb when they’d outlived their usefulness, Chairman Su was being despicable.

And too cold-hearted to believe.

At that moment, she felt shocked and disappointed.

Even a good employee like Linda could be fired and made the scapegoat as he wished.

Not to mention others.

This newly-appointed Chairman Su was pretty heartless.

Huo Lin decided to try and find other means to settle this, but she couldn’t reveal her intentions. She simply nodded and said, “Yes, Chairman Su. I got it. As for the other posts...”

“For those without evidence, just claim that they’re rumors. Get the lawyer to sue the person who made the post.”

Su Ze was very sure that the person behind the post couldn’t possibly have evidence of him having an affair with Qiao Anxin.
