Chapter 951: We Don’t Want This Artist Anymore

Ten minutes later, Linda knocked on the door.

“Come in.”

Linda pushed the door open and saw the man sitting at the desk. She went straight to the point. “Chairman Zhao, why are you looking for me?”

She had already guessed it.

She’d known Zhao Kai for many years. They weren’t just boss and subordinate, but also friends.

They knew each other well.

“You don’t have to address me as ‘you’. It sounds awkward. There are no outsiders here.” Zhao Kai pointed to the sofa. “Sit down first. What do you want to drink?”

Linda sat down at the side and shook her head. “There’s no need for that. Chairman Zhao, just tell me what you’re looking for me for. You know my personality, I don’t like to beat around the bush.”

“Alright, then.” Zhao Kai was a person who liked to be straightforward. After she sat down, he said, “The artiste you just signed, what’s her name again? Her surname is Qiao, right?”

Linda’s heart skipped a beat, but she maintained her composure and nodded. “Yes. Qiao Mianmian.”

It was indeed related to Qiao Mianmian.

“Mm, it’s her.” Zhao Kai leaned back in his black leather chair and frowned. “Have you seen what happened on her Weibo?”

“Yes.”

“This artiste has only been signed for a few days, right? Why is she causing trouble every other day? This time, the matter is so big, and everyone on Weibo is criticizing her. Even Tu Yilei’s fans are scolding people on our company’s official Weibo.

“Although an artiste needs popularity, it’s not good for her to cause so much trouble, right? Moreover, this time, such a huge matter has happened. I’m afraid the company won’t be able to settle it for her. If she wants to use public relations, she’ll have to spend a lot of money.

“She hasn’t brought many benefits to the company yet. It’s not a good deal to let the company spend so much money to settle things for her.”

Linda didn’t say a word. She waited for Zhao Kai to finish before asking calmly, “Chairman Zhao, are you saying that you don’t care about her?”

Zhao Kai twirled the ring on his finger and said calmly, “How am I going to manage it? Based on the current trend, do you think it’s a matter that can be settled by spending money to remove the trending searches and getting the Water Army to control ratings?”

Linda frowned. “Chairman Zhao, you mean...”

Zhao Kai looked up and glanced at her. “She offended someone and someone wants to mess with her. Otherwise, why do you think the hot searches went up so quickly?”

“But we can’t just ignore her. No matter what, she’s our artiste. Moreover, this isn’t her fault at all. Tu Yilei did it willingly, she didn’t force him to take the acid.

“It’s understandable that the fans attacked her because they are angry. But Chairman Zhao, you can’t be so biased, right?”

Zhao Kai snorted. “Of course I know it’s not her fault. But given the situation now, even if it’s not her fault, it has something to do with her. There’s no need for the company to keep such a troublemaker.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Linda was shocked. “Chairman Zhao, what do you mean?”

Zhao Kai looked straight at her. “Terminate the contract with her. We don’t want this artiste anymore.”
