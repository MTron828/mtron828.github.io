Chapter 1094: He Can’t Have Too Many Emotions

Her eyes were filled with grievance and pain.

He didn’t know why, but he felt as if his heart had been stabbed by something. He felt a slight pain in his heart.

He actually wanted to tell her that he didn’t want to be cold to her.

He felt terrible for treating her like that.

However, he didn’t want to give her any hope.

Hence, he treated everyone well except for her.

Then, she thought he hated her.

She didn’t know that if he really hated her, he wouldn’t even give her a chance to pester him.

How could he let her pester him for three whole years?

...

Qiao Mianmian saw Qiao Chen from afar.

Qiao Chen was born with fair skin. At first glance, he looked like a handsome youth from a comic, and his appearance was rather striking.

He stood under a Wutong tree.

In the evening, a breeze blew past, and the afterglow of the setting sun shone down.

The teenager in white standing under the tree had a delicate face, now slightly pale. Due to his thin figure, his white T-shirt seemed a little too big.

But this did not affect his outstanding appearance. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The girls who passed by him would steal a few glances at him with blushing faces.

Mo Yesi also saw his brother-in-law.

Seeing that every girl who passed by Qiao Chen was stealing glances at him, Mo Yesi couldn’t help but tease. “It looks like Chen Chen is very popular with girls in school. Are you worried that he’s in love early?”

Qiao Mianmian was well aware of her brother’s charm.

She had long known that Qiao Chen was very popular in school.

The siblings used to be in the same school. Before she graduated, Qiao Chen was the school prince.

How could he not be popular with girls?

At that time, countless girls had sent Qiao Chen love letters and breakfast.

However, she knew her brother very well.

Hence, she wasn’t worried that Qiao Chen would fall in love at all.

Besides, if he was really in love, he would tell her.

The siblings did not have many secrets.

Besides, she had never thought of Qiao Chen being in a relationship at such a young age. To her, it was fine as long as it didn’t affect his studies and both of them knew their limits.

However, Qiao Chen’s current condition wasn’t suitable for a relationship. He couldn’t have too many emotional fluctuations because of his illness, and it would be the easiest for him to lose his emotions if he was moved.

This would affect his body.

“I told Chen Chen that he won’t be in a relationship now. He’s just recovered a little, so he knows that dating will affect him.” Qiao Mianmian was still a little worried.

She didn’t know about Qiao Chen and Shen Xin before.

Now that she knew, she would worry.

If Qiao Chen didn’t have any feelings for Shen Xin, it wouldn’t matter.

But from Qiao Chen’s attitude that day, he clearly had feelings for her.

This worried Qiao Mianmian a little.

“Mm, Chen Chen’s current condition isn’t suitable for dating.” Mo Yesi understood Qiao Chen’s illness. He thought for a while and said, “But don’t worry too much. After a while, we can operate on him. After the surgery, Chen Chen can be like a normal person.”

“Really?” Qiao Mianmian turned around and looked at him. “After the surgery, Chen Chen can really be like a normal person? Mo Yesi, are you telling me the truth? Isn’t it too risky to operate on Chen Chen?”

The red light in front lit up.
