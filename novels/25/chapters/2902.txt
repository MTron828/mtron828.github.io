Chapter 2903: Sorrow

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She suddenly wanted to know what Mo Yesi had taught Qiao Chen.

“So, Sister, don’t worry.” The young man’s voice was warm and clear again. “I won’t let anything happen to me. I can protect myself too. As for me and Shen Xin… I know what to do.

“I know that feelings can’t be forced, but I can’t let go now.

“Perhaps I can let go when I give up completely.

“But before that, I still want to fight for it. Shen Xin pursued me for three years. In the next three years, it’s my turn to chase her. If she still doesn’t accept me after three years, or if she really has someone she likes, I… will let her go.”

Towards the end, the young man’s voice lowered. The words “let her go” were also very obscure.

What else could Qiao Mianmian say?

Qiao Chen wasn’t a child anymore. He was already an adult and could hold his own now.

As his sister, she could only persuade him about his relationship matters. In the end, he was the one who made the decision.

Moreover… Qiao Mianmian didn’t trust her judgment anymore.

Back then, she felt that Jiang Luoli and Mo Shixiu weren’t suitable for each other. But now, they were very close.

She also felt that Qiao Chen and Shen Xin weren’t suitable… but what if they could have a happy ending?

Qiao Chen had been very sensible since he was young, and she didn’t have to worry about him.

He could definitely settle his own relationship matters.

As his sister, she shouldn’t interfere too much.

After chatting with Qiao Chen, Qiao Mianmian went online to search for related news.

Soon, she found Qiao Anxin’s indecent videos.

Clicking on them, she saw that the indecent scenes had been pixelated. But Qiao Anxin’s face wasn’t pixelated, so she could tell that the person in the video was her.

As for the mosaic, the effects were even more exciting.

After all, it was all on its own.

People had always been imaginative.

In the video, besides Qiao Anxin, four well-built men could be seen.

The video lasted more than an hour.

Qiao Mianmian frowned and closed it after a few minutes.

She didn’t feel much when Qiao Chen said that indecent videos of Qiao Anxin had been uploaded online.

But after watching them, she was really shocked by Su Ze’s viciousness.

It was an undeniable fact that Su Ze was a jerk, but she didn’t expect him to be so terrible.

No matter what, Qiao Anxin had been his girlfriend for two years.

She was even pregnant with his child at some tpoint.

He was so heartless as to set Qiao Anxin up and upload the videos online.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t expect him to be so heartless.

No matter how much she disliked Qiao Anxin, she wouldn’t treat her this way.

Qiao Anxin was completely ruined.

Everyone on the internet knew that she was… FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Su Ze was ruthless because he wanted to destroy Qiao Anxin completely.

If she was lucky enough to survive, one could imagine how terrible her life would be.

The netizens also had mixed feelings about this..
