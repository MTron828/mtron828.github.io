Chapter 891: Every Second Was Precious to Him

“No.” Qiao Mianmian looked up at his pale face and got up to pour him a glass of water.

She returned to the bedside with the glass of water and handed it to Tu Yilei’s uninjured hand. “Senior Tu, do you want to rest for a while? You don’t seem to be in a good state.”

Only the two of them were left in the ward.

Bai Yusheng didn’t stay for long. He stayed in the ward for about 10 minutes before leaving.

Michael accompanied him for almost an hour. After receiving a call, he had to leave temporarily.

In the end, only Qiao Mianmian was left in the ward with Tu Yilei.

If Tu Yilei wasn’t injured because of her, Qiao Mianmian wouldn’t have stayed for so long.

She’d have just come to see him symbolically and left.

But this time, Tu Yilei was injured because of her. She had to stay and accompany him.

Tu Yilei took a sip of water and kept quiet for a while before shaking his head gently. “I’m not tired, nor am I sleepy. If you’re tired, you can leave first. You don’t have to stay here with me.”

He was actually tired and sleepy and wanted to rest.

But if he said that, Qiao Mianmian would probably immediately leave.

He finally had the chance to be alone with her.

Every second was precious to him.

He wanted her to spend more time with him.

He knew that she was staying here out of guilt.

Because he had taken the blow meant for her.

She felt sorry for him, so she was making it up to him.

If it wasn’t for this incident, her attitude towards him would have been as cold and distant as before.

He would never be treated like this.

Not only could he spend more time with her alone, but she was also smiling at him now.

Tu Yilei suddenly felt that his injuries were worth it.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

It was worth it to receive such treatment.

“That’s not what I meant.” Qiao Mianmian immediately said, “Go to sleep if you’re tired. I’ll continue to stay here and finish the drip with you.”

Tu Yilei was stunned. He looked up at her and asked, “You won’t leave?”

Qiao Mianmian nodded. “You haven’t finished your drip. I’ll leave when Michael comes back.”

“You don’t have to accompany me if you have something on. I can call the nurse in.” Tu Yilei regretted it the moment he said that.

He was afraid that Qiao Mianmian would really leave.

But he couldn’t take it back.

Thankfully, what he was worried about didn’t happen.

Qiao Mianmian shook her head and picked out another orange from the fruit basket on the bedside table and slowly peeled it with the knife. “I’ve said it before, we’ll talk after you’re done with the drip. Are you sure you don’t want to sleep?”

Tu Yilei subconsciously looked up at the drip bag. When he saw that the bag was almost full, his lips curled up slightly.

“Mm, I’m not sleepy.”

He said tiredly, “If you’re tired, you can sleep for a while.”

“I’m here to accompany the patient. There’s no such thing as a patient who hasn’t gone to bed yet.” Qiao Mianmian smiled and handed him a slice of the peeled orange. “How are we going to spend the rest of the time? Do you want to watch a movie? Or do you like to do something else? What do you like to do when you’re not working?”
