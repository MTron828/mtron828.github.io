Chapter 1560: Say It Again

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

If she didn’t consider her popularity, Qiao Mianmian might really be chosen.

...

The audition location was at a famous five-star hotel.

Qiao Mianmian and Linda got out of the car. Just as they reached the hotel entrance, they heard a surprised and incredulous voice behind them. “Qiao Mianmian? Why are you here?”

Qiao Mianmian was shocked to hear this voice. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

She frowned and turned around slowly.

Behind her, Qiao Anxin’s eyes widened as she stared at Qiao Mianmian.

“It’s really you.” She stared at Qiao Mianmian for a few seconds before asking angrily, “What are you doing here?”

Qiao Mianmian looked at her expressionlessly. “Then, why are you here?

Qiao Mianmian was surprised to meet Qiao Anxin here and looked at her again.

Qiao Anxin was also here for today’s audition?

“What am I here for? Of course, I’m here to audition for Director Cheng’s movie. You can’t be here for the audition too, right?”

Qiao Anxin didn’t wait for Qiao Mianmian’s reply. She sneered and said disdainfully, “What am I talking about? How could you be here for the audition? Could it be that you didn’t get the chance to audition and came here to try out a role?

“Qiao Mianmian, I advise you to give up. This isn’t a place you should be at.”

“If someone like you can come for the audition, why can’t our Mianmian do it?” Linda and Qiao Anxin had old grudges, and they were enemies. She looked at Qiao Anxin and sneered. “At least our Mianmian got the role cleanly, unlike some people who have to sell something.”

Linda had been in this industry for many years.

She naturally knew a lot about it.

She’d already heard about Qiao Anxin accompanying Boss Huang.

She had a feud with Qiao Anxin, so she didn’t hold back.

Qiao Anxin’s expression changed as she glared at her. “Xie Linda, what did you say? Say it again if you dare.”

“I’ll say it again.” Linda smiled coldly. “Why, did I wrong you? Everyone in the industry knows about your past. Why are you acting in front of me?

“I didn’t say it out loud because I wanted to save you some face. It’d be awful if I did.”

Linda didn’t hold back at all, as if she didn’t see Qiao Anxin’s face turn green. She continued to mock her coldly. “If Star Splendor hadn’t given all the good resources to you alone in the past and spent so many years supporting you, would you be where you are today?

“If the same resources were thrown at other newbies with potential, they’d be popular long ago. And some people have barely made it to the front line. Now that they’ve left Star Splendor, they don’t have the resources thrown at them anymore. Wouldn’t they be back to square one?

“It’s not that I want to say it, but with your acting skills, coming to the audition today is just asking for humiliation. I advise you to give up and leave this place as soon as possible. This isn’t a place you should be at.” Linda returned Qiao Anxin’s words to her.

She wasn’t afraid when Qiao Anxin was still in Star Splendor.

So, she had nothing to fear now.
