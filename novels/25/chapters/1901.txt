Chapter 1902: Song Ke, I Think You’re Really Crazy

She thought that as long as a few people were willing to speak up for her, she could plead with Qiao Mianmian and perhaps stay.

Her face was pale as she stood rooted to the ground. Seeing that Little Xiao and Qiao Anxin had not left, she turned around and grabbed Little Xiao’s hand tightly.

It was like she was grabbing onto a life-saving straw.

“Little Xiao, help me.” The two usually had a good relationship. No matter what, Little Xiao would definitely help her.

Unexpectedly, Little Xiao frowned and took her hand back.

Song Ke looked at her in shock.

Little Xiao took half a step back and kept a distance from her. She said very distantly, “Song Ke, I can’t help you with this matter. Sister Fei is right. This is between you and Qiao Mianmian. The rest of us can’t interfere.”

“I think you should go and apologize to Qiao Mianmian. Maybe she’ll forgive you.”

Little Xiao wasn’t stupid.

She wouldn’t help Song Ke at this time.

Song Ke must have been removed because Qiao Mianmian had found out that she was the one behind it.

Song Ke might even be banned.

If she went to plead for Song Ke at this time, she would be the next one to leave if she was implicated.

Besides, she and Song Ke were just fake sisters.

Hence, when something happened to Song Ke, she only wanted to draw the line between them.

“I still have to go back to my room to pack my luggage. See you in the future.” Little Xiao turned around and left.

Seeing how realistic she was, Song Ke was furious. “Little Xiao, you scheming b*tch. If you didn’t drive a wedge between us, I wouldn’t have such a big opinion of Qiao Mianmian. I can finally see that you used me to deal with Qiao Mianmian.

“Do you think your ending will be any better now that you’re kicking me while I’m down? I’ll get someone to post those words on Weibo. It was you who taught me how to do it. You’re the one who asked me to do it. Do you want to pretend that you’ve not done anything? Dream on!”

Song Ke finally realized that Little Xiao was using her.

She thought that if she couldn’t stay, she wouldn’t let Little Xiao stay either.

If she was going to die, she’d drag her down with her.

Little Xiao’s face suddenly changed. She stopped in her tracks and angrily said, “Song Ke, what nonsense are you talking about? How can you be like this? Don’t randomly put the blame on me. I think you must be crazy to catch someone and bite them.”

“Little Xiao, if I’m replaced, you can forget about staying.” Song Ke gritted his teeth and said, “After you used me, you want me to pretend that nothing happened? No way!”

Little Xiao was also exasperated. “Song Ke, I think you’re really crazy.”

Qiao Anxin saw them fighting and smiled. She was about to leave when she saw Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi walk in.

Qiao Anxin bit her lip.

At this moment, Song Ke also saw them.

Her gaze first landed on Mo Yesi, then on Qiao Mianmian.

She hesitated for a few seconds before rushing over.

Before she could reach Qiao Mianmian, Mo Yesi blocked her way. Song Ke had just run over when Mo Yesi kicked her away. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

She was kicked back a few steps.

After stabilizing herself, she looked at the man who had infatuated her just now with a frightened expression. When she met the man’s sharp eyes, her infatuation was instantly cured, and a fearful expression appeared on her face.
