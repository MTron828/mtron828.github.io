Chapter 1950: Tsk Tsk, I Think I Know Something

#Qiao Mianmian and her ex-boyfriend Su Ze rekindled their relationship

Qiao Mianmian clicked on the trending topic with a dark expression. After reading it, her expression darkened further.

Someone had taken a photo of her talking to Su Ze in the corridor last night. The photo was very clear, and it was taken from several angles, allowing her to see the person’s face clearly.

Moreover, the person who took the photo clearly had the intention of defaming her. There were several angles where she and Su Ze seemed to be in ambiguous poses.

Coupled with the words “old flame”, it was inevitable that some people who didn’t know the truth would be misled.

Qiao Mianmian had just participated in “The Meaning of Traveling” and had gained a lot of popularity. It was time for her popularity to soar.

Such news would have a huge impact on her.

This piece of news received a lot of attention. When Qiao Mianmian clicked on it, she saw that the number of comments had already surpassed 10,000.

She clicked into the comments section.

It was a good thing that she had gained a good reputation because of “The Meaning of Traveling”. The show hadn’t finished airing yet, and it was still very popular. Many fans in the comments section spoke up for her.

It was unlike the past where she was always being criticized. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“I don’t believe Qiao Mianmian would do something like that. There wasn’t anything ambiguous in the photo, just the two of them talking in the corridor. Isn’t it too arbitrary to say that they’ve rekindled their relationship?”

“Come on, our Mianmian’s boyfriend is handsome, rich, and treats her so well. It’s not like she has a screw loose in her head, why would she fall in love with a scumbag ex? What does she want from him? Does she want a scumbag? Does she want him because he’s uglier now, or is it because he’s poorer?”

“That’s right, our Mianmian has a rich and handsome boyfriend, so how could she fall for that scumbag Su? Scumbag Su is so good-looking, but our Mianmian won’t even look at him. Maybe Scumbag Su won’t let go of Mianmian, but Mianmian doesn’t even want to talk to him.”

“Upstairs said there’s nothing out of line in the photos. Just based on these few photos, it is indeed not right to say that she rekindled with her old flame.”

“The man in the photo is the young master of the Su family? Why has he become so ugly? I remember that Scumbag Su used to look decent. With his looks, Qiao Mianmian wouldn’t have taken a liking to him. Her boyfriend’s looks, figure, and all other aspects are better than Scumbag Su.”

Many people spoke up for Qiao Mianmian, saying that she wouldn’t have such bad taste. Instead of cherishing her rich and handsome boyfriend, she went to reconcile with her scumbag ex.

But some haters also took the opportunity to criticize her.

“Is Qiao Mianmian cheating? This kind of woman who looks down on others is really disgusting. Can her tall, rich, and handsome boyfriend tolerate being a cuckold?”

“Meet at the hotel? Tsk tsk, I think I know something.”

“This kind of green tea b*tch is like this. She likes to hang men everywhere. The purer a woman looks on the outside, the more unrestrained she is on the inside. She was never a good person, to begin with. Previously, someone revealed that she liked to hook up with men everywhere since she was young.”

“The ex made a cuckold out of him the moment he came back? Awesome!”

Qiao Mianmian quickly browsed through the comments and then exited Weibo.

The reporter was still asking her, “Qiao Mianmian, do you have anything to say about your meeting with Su Ze at Shaodong Hotel?”
