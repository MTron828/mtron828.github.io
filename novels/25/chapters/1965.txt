Chapter 1968: It wasn’t as bad as she thought

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

She was afraid that Qiao Chen wouldn’t be used to it.

She was also afraid that someone would bully Qiao Chen.

But looking at Qiao Chen now, he seemed to be in a good state.

It was not as bad as she thought.

“Your brother-in-law and I are going to the Bai family for dinner tonight. I have to promote the new drama for the next half a month, so I’ll definitely be busy by then. So I just need to make time to visit you. Otherwise, we’ll have to wait a long time for our next meeting.”

“Sis, are you busy with work again? Didn’t you just finish recording your variety show? Your company doesn’t give you a break.”

.

“That’s right. It’s not that the company doesn’t want to give me a break, but I happen to have a new drama that I need to promote, so I don’t have much time to rest. I just wanted to see if you’ve been doing well recently.”

“I’m fine.” Qiao Chen smiled. “I eat well and sleep well. I’m happy every day. There’s nothing wrong with that.”

“Look, I’ve gained a few pounds recently.” Qiao Chen pinched his face.

“Mm, you did gain some weight.” Qiao Mianmian pinched his cheek and smiled. “As long as you’re happy, I hope you can live happily every day. But if you’re unhappy, you have to tell me.”

“Chen Chen, we’re siblings. No matter if we’ve returned to our biological family or not, you’re still my younger brother in this lifetime.”

“Sister, you’ll always be my sister. In my heart, you’ll always be my biological sister.” Qiao Chen held Qiao Mianmian’s hand, his eyes glistening with tears. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Qiao Mianmian reached out to touch his head. “Mm, we’ll always be siblings. So you can tell me anything. I don’t want you to keep anything to yourself.”

“It’s sad to suffer alone.”

“If that’s the case, my heart will ache.”

“Sister, I know.” Qiao Chen nodded.

“Are you used to your new home now? How is Second Uncle treating you?”

“I’m already used to it. Dad treats me quite well too. He already feels guilty towards my mom, so he has always wanted to make up for the regrets in his heart through me. On the contrary, he treats me too well. I’m not used to it.”

“Then... what about Second Madam?” Qiao Mianmian thought about what Second Madam had done to Qiao Chen’s birth mother and asked worriedly, “Did she do anything bad to you?”

“Her?” Qiao Chen smirked, his eyes filled with disdain. “I know all her tricks. Sister, don’t worry, I can handle it.”

Qiao Mianmian was afraid that he would underestimate his opponent.

“You still have to be more careful. Don’t take it lightly. It’s good to be confident, but it’s also not good to be too confident. Be careful not to fall into someone else’s trap. Second Madam’s mind isn’t as simple as you think.”

“Mm, Sister, don’t worry. Don’t you still have Brother-in-law? Brother-in-law will help me too. I know what to do. I’ll protect myself. But you...” Qiao Chen said, frowning slightly.” I see that your circle is very messy. There are always people defaming you, so you have to be more careful. Protect yourself. ”

Qiao Mianmian smiled. “That’s how the entertainment industry is. This means that your sister is famous. If I’m not popular, who would want to bother with me? Don’t you see that those big stars have a lot of dirt on them? And the more popular they are, the easier it is for others to defame them.”

Qiao Chen was speechless.

He sighed. “It’s fine if I just criticize you. I’m just afraid that what happened the last time would endanger your safety. You don’t even know that I was worried to death when I found out that you went on a show with Qiao Anxin.”
