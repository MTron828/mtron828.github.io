Chapter 450: He Can Do That for the Rest of His Life

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

She had to let her Prince Charming know that she was on his side.

This was so that Prince Charming would be reminded of her when he was spoiling her baby.

Prince Charming was really generous.

Something that cost a little for him was a lot for her.

Jiang Luoli was happy just thinking about it.

It’s great to have a best friend with such an awesome husband.

Qiao Mianmian said, “We’ve been meeting every day. Anyway, even if we are married, my life can’t revolve around him.”

She thought for a while and continued, “Let’s continue with our plan.”

“But...” Jiang Luoli didn’t object to her proposal, but asked instead, “What about Prince Charming, then? Isn’t he angry? Aren’t you going to do something about it?”

“It’s alright. It’s easy to appease him.”

Qiao Mianmian smiled as she recalled the previous times she appeased Mo Yesi. “I’ll appease him when I see him tomorrow.”

“Haha.” Jiang Luoli laughed.

She laughed so hard that her facial mask almost felt off.

“Baby, do you know what you sound like when you mentioned Prince Charming?

“How do I sound?”

“You sound like you’re talking about appeasing your kid.”

“I don’t have a kid...”

“Now that you mentioned it, Prince Charming is really cute.”

“Sometimes I guess?” Especially when he whined to her for favors, when he was being clingy, and when he became angry due to his childishness.

“I feel that Prince Charming really likes you.”

“How can you tell?”

“It’s so obvious. Hadn’t you realized? Prince Charming is always so gentle with you, but he’s so cold towards others.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

She really didn’t realize it.

“But he still hasn’t replied to me.” Qiao Mianmian frowned, getting a bit upset as well.

She felt that Mo Yesi was being too petty.

It wasn’t as though she was going out with a guy.

Jiang Luoli thought for a while and suggested. “Why don’t you give him a call?”

“No!”

Qiao Mianmian was prideful over the matter. She bit her lip and said angrily, “I won’t send him any more messages. If he doesn’t want to reply to me, he can do that for the rest of his life.”

Jiang Luoli was speechless.

They were still in the honeymoon phase.

But they were fighting already.

Somehow, she felt that Prince Charming was going to have a hard time chasing after her baby.

How could he behave this way when he was the one chasing after her?

Which girl would accept a suitor like him?

Even if they accepted him, it would be because of his looks and wealth.

His personality was really bad!

...

Qiao Mianmian was serious when she said that she wasn’t going to care about him.

She finalized on the dinner place with Jiang Luoli. She then changed and was really heading out.

...

On the other side.

The workers realized that their Chairman Mo was frequently checking his phone over the short meeting.

How frequently was he checking his phone?

He checked it every minute.

It was as though he was waiting for someone to text him.

Someone important to him.
