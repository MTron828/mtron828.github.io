Chapter 915: He Was Her Dream Lover

Jiang Luoli was speechless. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

But she really wanted to know.

She wanted to know what Mo Shixiu was thinking about her.

Moreover, she didn’t mind at all.

He was Mo Shixiu.

Her dream lover.

She wouldn’t mind even if he wanted to do something ungentlemanly to her!

Of course, she couldn’t say it out loud.

He was shocked by what she said.

If she said anything else, would he regret meeting her this time?

She didn’t want to scare him.

“Mr. Mo, may I ask why you want to see me?” Jiang Luoli was in a much better mood than before, but she hadn’t completely calmed down. She couldn’t remain calm in front of Mo Shixiu.

This man was a legend in her heart.

She finally saw him today. How could she calm down?

But she was really curious why Mo Shixiu decided to meet her.

Didn’t he get Assistant Xu to compensate her because he didn’t want to see her?

Since he’d already decided not to see her, why did he change his mind now?

Was it because he suddenly felt guilty?

But what was there to feel bad about?

Mo Shixiu’s expression returned to normal when he heard her question. He thought for a while before looking at her gently and saying, “Miss Jiang, I’ve said it before. It was the wrong decision to get Assistant Xu to give you the compensation that day. Now, I want to correct my mistake. I still want to make it up to you, but I hope you can tell me how to do it.”

In Mo Shixiu’s opinion, girls were always at a disadvantage in such matters.

Hence, he wanted him to make it up to her.

“What do you mean?” Jiang Luoli blinked and couldn’t help but tighten her grip on her bag. “Mr. Mo, are you taking back that check?”

Although sleeping with Mo Shixiu was a win-win situation, she didn’t want to return the compensation that she had already received.

It was as if she was about to spit out the delicious duck meat in her mouth.

How could she bear to?

Although she was a good-looking person, she had her own principles.

She had slept with him.

She had taken the money that was rightfully hers.

She couldn’t return the 50 million just because she slept with her Prince Charming!

She... couldn’t do it!

Jiang Luoli suddenly wondered if Mo Shixiu regretted giving her 50 million yuan.

Did he want to take it back?

He even said that giving her money was an insult...

At this thought, her expression changed, and she was no longer in the mood to be smitten.

Although Prince Charming was good, compared to 50 million yuan...

She’d better choose the 50 million.

Mo Shixiu looked at her nervous and alert expression and was stunned for a while. Then, he couldn’t help but chuckle. “Miss Jiang, don’t worry. That’s not what I meant. Since I’ve already given you the money, it’s yours. I can’t take it back.”

He wasn’t trying to take the money back?

Jiang Luoli heaved a sigh of relief.

As long as it wasn’t about taking the check back, everything was fine.
