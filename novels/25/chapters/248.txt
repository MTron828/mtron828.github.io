The man’s sexy thin lips curled up in a satisfied smile, and he said in a joyful voice, “Continue doing this in the future. If he pesters you again, just tell him to get lost.

“If he clings to you shamelessly and refuses to leave, just tell me. I’ll get someone to break his leg.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Wasn’t breaking his leg a little too violent?

But she felt like he was thinking too much.

Why would Su Ze cling to her shamelessly?

He was now with Qiao Anxin and was absolutely not interested in his ex-girlfriend.

Qiao Chen, sitting in front, wanted to shout “Brother-in-law is so mighty and domineering”.

He felt like he could rest assured now.

He no longer had to worry about his sister getting bullied.

With such an awesome brother-in-law covering for her, what did she have to be afraid of?

His brother-in-law pampered his sister so much and was both rich and powerful. He could definitely take good care of his sister.

He wouldn’t let anyone bully her.

...

Mo Yesi received a call halfway on the road.

It was Madam Mo.

“Ah Si, today is the weekend, shouldn’t you come home? You didn’t come back last week, so your grandma has been asking for you. She said she misses you.” Madam Mo’s voice still sounded young and, in fact, she herself wasn’t too old.

She was only in her forties this year.

She got married early to Mo Yesi’s father, Mo Yuncheng, just when she reached the legal marriageable age.

Mo Yesi looked down at the girl lying obediently in his arms and hesitated. He gave a soft “Ok” to the person on the other end of the phone.

But Madam Mo seemed a little unsatisfied. “What do you mean? Are you coming back or not? Let me tell you, there’s a guest here tonight. So, unless you have something important to do, you better come back.”

“Guest?” Mo Yesi raised an eyebrow. “What guest?”

“Rourou has returned to China, don’t tell me you didn’t know.” Madam Mo’s voice was much gentler when talking about Shen Rou. “This child is very filial. She just returned to China and has come to see us. She has even brought us many gifts.

“I didn’t dote on her in vain all these years. It would be great if she was my own daughter. With such a caring daughter, I feel like I can live twenty more years. Unlike you, bad boy, I’ve been worried about you since you were young. Now that you’re in your twenties, you’re still so worrying.”

Madam Mo complained. “You’re already reaching your thirties, yet you still don’t have a partner. Just look at your childhood friend, Xiao Yan. He has changed partners time and time again, why don’t you have the same skill as him?”

Mo Yesi listened expressionlessly as Madam Mo scolded him.

After she finished speaking, he simply replied faintly, “He’s fickle in love, it’s not considered a skill.”

“He’s still better than you!” Madam Mo sounded very angry at the mention of this. “At least he’s normal, unlike you. Only Rourou has been by your side since young, what other girl do you know? Rourou is a good girl. I would also agree if you can be together with her, but you said you only saw her as a sister.

“I introduced you to so many excellent girls, and you won’t even look at them. Are you trying to make me die of anxiety? Can I even watch you get married and give birth in my lifetime?”

Mo Yesi’s expression was dull as he listened to Madam Mo’s furious voice.
