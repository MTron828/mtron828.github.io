Chapter 2472: Untitled

The comments on the female secretary’s Weibo post were mainly divided into two groups.

They were Qiao Mianmian’s fans, as well as Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi’s CP fans.

A group of people deliberately said that Qiao Mianmian must have opened another account.

Mo Yesi didn’t respond to any of the trending topics. It was different from how he used to defend Qiao Mianmian on Weibo.

Hence, there must be something wrong with their relationship.

As for the other netizens, they were all fence-sitters.

One moment, they believed the secretary, and the next moment, they felt that the group of people was right.

The public relations manager reported what he saw on Weibo to Wei Zheng.

“Assistant Wei, someone who claims to be an employee of our company posted on Weibo. She should have tried to help Chairman Mo and Miss Qiao refute the rumors. Her Weibo was reposted by many people and is even trending, but many netizens still don’t believe what she said.”

“An employee of the Mo Corporation? What did she say?”

The public relations manager read the post to Wei Zheng.

After reading it, he paused for a while and continued, “The people spurring the rumors are now insisting that Chairman Mo didn’t post on Weibo to express his love for Miss Qiao, which means that a problem with their relationship really exists.”

Wei Zheng kept quiet for a while.

“Deal with the trending topics first. I’ll talk to Chairman Mo. Also, find out who’s behind this.”

“Yes, Assistant Wei.”

Wei Zheng believed that the public relations department would definitely settle this matter.

After all, if they couldn’t handle it well, no one could.

Hence, Wei Zheng was about to settle another matter.

He had to do it himself.

Before leaving, Wei Zheng sent Mo Yesi a WeChat message.

Wei Zheng: [Chairman Mo, the public relations department has said that the fastest way to respond to the trending topics is to post a Weibo message to express your love for Young Madam. If you post it personally, those rumors will fall apart.]

Wei Zheng felt that this was a good idea.

Didn’t they say that Chairman Mo would regret choosing Young Madam?

At this time, Chairman Mo’s high-profile declaration of love for Young Madam would indeed be more effective than anything else.

Most importantly, he could anger the person behind the scenes.

Although the public relations department hadn’t found out who the mastermind was, Wei Zheng had already guessed it.

Young Madam had a few enemies, but after being dealt with by Chairman Mo, there was no one left.

After that, Chairman Mo and Young Madam made it public. After knowing that Chairman Mo was the Chairman of the Mo Corporation and Young Madam was the daughter of the Bai family, no one dared to do anything to her anymore.

No one dared to offend the Bai and Mo families.

If they offended these two families, they wouldn’t be able to survive in the entertainment industry.

It wasn’t easy to survive in the entertainment industry.

Anyone who made a name for themselves would cherish everything they had.

Hence, Wei Zheng guessed that the people behind the fake comments weren’t hired by anyone in the entertainment industry.

It wasn’t hard to guess who had the guts to do this.

Especially when the trending topics praised Shen Rou.

The mastermind was too obvious.
