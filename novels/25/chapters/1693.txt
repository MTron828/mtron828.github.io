Chapter 1695: It Seems Like I’m Thinking Too Much

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“That Qiao Chen...”

Madam Shen looked at Shen Xin’s pale face and frowned. “Xiao Xin, you chased him for so many years? Why didn’t I know about this?”

​

“Mom.” Shen Xin bit her lip.

“Our Shen and Mo families are strangers now. I don’t want my two daughters to have anything to do with them.” Madam Shen thought of something and said coldly, “You’re about to transfer schools. No matter what you’re thinking, put it away.

“The most important thing to you now is your studies. Don’t delay your studies because of something not worth it. Do you understand?”

Madam Shen still had high hopes for her younger daughter.

Shen Xin’s grades were very good. It shouldn’t be a problem for her to get into a famous university.

Even if the Shen Family was down and out now, she couldn’t let her two daughters live a poor life. If they were outstanding themselves, they could live a good life on their own.

Of course, the main reason why Madam Shen was afraid that Shen Xin was thinking about Qiao Chen was because of Shen Rou.

It was precisely because her eldest daughter was too persistent and insisted on waiting for the so-called true love that she missed so many good marriages.

If it wasn’t for Mo Yesi, she might have gotten married a long time ago.

With the family’s situation, she could definitely find a good marriage.

Now that the Shen Family was in trouble, she could find someone to help her.

Madam Shen didn’t want her other daughter to be like this.

Shen Xin looked at Madam Shen and moved her lips.

She had a lot to say, but in the end, she didn’t.

“Mom, I got it.” In the end, Shen Xin replied obediently, “Don’t worry, I’ll definitely get into a good university. I won’t let you and Dad down.”

Madam Shen stroked her head and said in satisfaction, “You’ve always been the most obedient. I’m not worried about you. Alright, have a good rest. Your sister and I won’t disturb you anymore. We’ll come and see you later.”

Shen Xin nodded, and Madam Shen pulled the blanket over her. She then got up and gently pulled Shen Rou’s arm, signaling her to leave with her.

Shen Rou’s expression was still awful.

She glanced at Shen Xin coldly before leaving with Madam Shen.

...

After leaving the ward, Madam Shen asked about Shen Xin.

“Why do you think Xiao Xin likes Qiao Chen?”

Shen Xin sneered. “Didn’t I say it already? She pursued him for several years, but he didn’t take her seriously. I thought I could get her to plead with Qiao Chen, and then get him to plead with his family. Perhaps our family could still be saved.

“It seems like I was overthinking.

“Qiao Chen doesn’t care about her at all. How could he agree to help?”

Madam Mo kept quiet for a while.

“Actually, there’s another way to save our family.” She looked straight at Shen Rou.

Shen Rou’s expression changed slightly. “Mom, are you talking about blind dates? What family is willing to get involved in this? Even if they are willing, do they have the ability to revive the Shen Family?

“Mom, I don’t want to marry anyone.”

Shen Rou was afraid that after the family went bankrupt, she wouldn’t be able to live a good life.

She was also afraid of becoming a joke.

But if saving the Shen Family required her to marry a pig-headed man, she’d rather the family go bankrupt!
