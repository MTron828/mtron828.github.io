Chapter 1622: Why Do I Need a Reason to Wait for My Wife?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Mm.”

“If you don’t find it boring, then stay. Anyway, I won’t be able to care about you when I’m busy.”

“I don’t need you to accompany me.”

“Alright.” Bai Yusheng suddenly thought of something.

He also recalled that Qiao Mianmian and Qin Han had two intimate scenes in the afternoon.

Having been friends for so many years, he naturally knew Mo Yesi’s personality.

But like Qiao Mianmian, Bai Yusheng didn’t intend to tell him now.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t tell Mo Yesi that she had an intimate scene with Qin Han in the afternoon because she was afraid that he would be jealous.

Bai Yusheng wanted to watch a good show.

How would Mo Yesi react when he saw Qiao Mianmian’s intimate scene with another man?

Bai Yusheng looked forward to it. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Then, Mianmian, we don’t have to bother about him.” Bai Yusheng looked at the time on his watch and clapped. “Go and touch up your makeup and familiarize yourself with the script. The next scene will be yours.”

Qiao Mianmian nodded and let go of Mo Yesi’s hand. “Then, I’ll go and touch up my makeup?”

“Mm, go on.”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t bother with him while she was working. She turned around and went to the dressing room.

Bai Yusheng got someone to bring a chair over and Mo Yesi sat down beside him.

“Why are you suddenly waiting for her at the set? Do you feel threatened by the news online?” Bai Yusheng asked teasingly when he saw Qin Han walking over.

Mo Yesi glanced at Qin Han and said calmly, “What reason do I need to wait for my wife? As for the sense of crisis, no one in your crew can make me feel threatened.”

“Is that so?” Bai Yusheng smiled. “That’s for the best. It’s good that you’re confident. Now I’m not worried that you’ll be jealous when Mianmian shoots an intimate scene with another man.”

Mo Yesi’s expression changed.

He narrowed his eyes and frowned. “Mianmian has an intimate scene with another man? Who are you referring to, the male lead?”

Bai Yusheng looked at his expression and found it funny. “Don’t you know that all female leads can’t avoid intimate scenes with the male lead?”

Mo Yesi frowned.

Of course, he knew.

Was it normal for the male and female leads to not have intimate scenes?

When he accepted Qiao Mianmian as an actress, he was already mentally prepared.

But hearing it from Bai Yusheng made him feel uncomfortable.

Bai Yusheng looked at his expression and continued, “You should know that this is Mianmian’s job. If you can’t accept it, I suggest you don’t stay on set. Otherwise...”

He would be furious when he saw Qiao Mianmian and Qin Han acting intimate.

Mo Yesi frowned. “Did she have an intimate scene this afternoon?”

“Let me think.” Bai Yusheng pretended to think for a while before saying, “I think so. The next two scenes have a lot of intimate contact.”

Mo Yesi’s expression darkened.

He pursed his lips and kept quiet for a while before saying coldly, “Give me the script, let me take a look.”

“The script is our crew’s confidential document, you...”
