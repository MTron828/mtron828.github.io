Chapter 1713: Reality Proved That I Guessed Correctly?

Qiao Mianmian knew very well that Mo Yesi was a person who preferred soft tactics over hard tactics. She had already prepared a series of soft attacks.

The dishes were served.

Qiao Mianmian immediately picked up a prawn and a piece of fish.

She put down her chopsticks and looked at him. “Hubby, try it.”

“How is it? Is it good?” Qiao Mianmian asked expectantly.

She rarely cooked for Mo Yesi.

This seemed like the first time.

Moreover, she hadn’t cooked in a long time, so she wasn’t confident in her current culinary skills.

Although she had already tasted it and felt that it wasn’t bad.

But Mo Yesi’s mouth, which had only tasted food cooked by chefs since he was young, must be very picky.

He probably wasn’t interested in ordinary home-cooked dishes.

“Mm, it’s delicious.” Mo Yesi ate another piece of prawn and gave his best comment. “This is the best dish I’ve ever eaten. Thank you for making such a delicious dinner for me.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

This was too much.

Even though she knew this was just sweet talk to make her happy, she was still very much so.

She scooped some more prawns into his bowl and smiled. “Then eat more. If you like it, I’ll make more for you in the future.”

Mo Yesi smiled and put some food into her bowl. “That won’t do. My wife’s face and hands can’t be stained with smoke and fire. You’ve worked hard tonight. Eat more, too.”

Qiao Mianmian knew how to sweet talk.

She blinked and focused on the man beside her. “Your liking is more important than anything else. My husband is so good, everything I do for you is worth it. Moreover, I’m happy to be able to do something for you.”

Mo Yesi held his chopsticks and smiled.

He smiled and pinched her cheek. “Baby, just tell me what you want to say. You don’t have to do so much.”

Qiao Mianmian blinked.

Was she that obvious? She hadn’t even said anything, how could he tell?

She was puzzled. “How did you know I have something to tell you?”

Mo Yesi’s smile deepened. “You’re so obvious, how could I not know?”

“How is it obvious?” Qiao Mianmian was even more puzzled.

“You’re usually not this passionate towards me.” Mo Yesi couldn’t help but pinch her nose. “You’re only like this when you have something to ask me.”

“Reality proved that I guessed right?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Alright, she felt that she was just acting normally.

It seemed like she wasn’t usually passionate enough towards Mo Yesi.

Actually, from the moment she took the initiative to call him Hubby, Mo Yesi knew that she had something to ask him.

Moreover, she took the initiative to cook tonight.

Her intention was too obvious...

“Alright.” Qiao Mianmian sighed. “Since you’ve guessed it, I won’t beat around the bush. I do have something to discuss with you.”
