Chapter 2007: Gong Zeli, Have You Fallen for Her?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Shen Rou washed up and went downstairs.

The housemaids greeted her respectfully. “Miss.”

Shen Rou saw Gong Zeli sitting on the sofa. She looked at this man who used to care and love her so much but was now cold and distant to her with complicated feelings.

She walked over slowly.

Gong Zeli looked up when he heard footsteps.

“Zeli, I’ve made you wait. Are you unhappy?” Shen Rou walked towards him and sat down opposite him. The housemaid immediately served a cup of hot tea and she took a sip..ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Gong Zeli looked at her expressionlessly. “Tell me, why are you looking for me?”

Shen Rou looked at his expressionless face and stiffened.

Mo Yesi had always been indifferent to her.

Hence, even though she felt terrible when he rejected her and treated her coldly, she didn’t feel too different.

But Gong Zeli was different.

She had enjoyed his care and love for so many years.

It was even more unacceptable to lose something you possessed for so long.

Shen Rou still couldn’t accept this difference.

“Zeli, how long has it been since we last met? Can’t we catch up first?”

“I don’t have time to catch up with you,” Gong Zeli said coldly. “If you don’t tell me what it is, I’m leaving.”

Gong Zeli stood up.

As if he was really leaving.

Shen Rou panicked. “Zeli, wait, don’t go.”

She took a deep breath and said, “Let’s talk somewhere else.”

A while later, they arrived at the study.

Shen Rou closed the door.

“Tell me, what is it?” Gong Zeli looked at her coldly.

Shen Rou clenched her fists. “Can’t we meet if I don’t have anything to say to you? Do you really want to be so distant with me? Yes, I lied to you about that matter back then, but that’s all I lied to you about.

“Am I so unforgivable in your eyes?”

Gong Zeli frowned. “Only lied to me about one thing? Do you think this is something insignificant and not worth getting angry over?”

“Isn’t it?” Shen Rou looked aggrieved. “I know I was wrong, and I’ve already apologized to you. Can’t you forgive me on account of our many years of friendship? Even if I made a mistake, you have to give me a chance to make amends.”

“Because of your so-called mistake, do you know what I’ve missed?” Gong Zeli’s eyes were cold. “This is only a mistake to you, but to me, I missed the most important person in my life.

“You want me to forgive you? Shen Rou, I’ll never forgive you in this lifetime.”

Shen Rou’s expression stiffened.

She clenched her fists.

She looked at the man who promised to treat her well for the rest of his life and couldn’t help but ask, “Have you found the person who saved you? Who is she? If I’m not wrong, she should be a girl, right?

“Gong Zeli, have you fallen for her?

“You like her just because she saved you?

“Then, what have we been doing for the past decade?”

“You don’t have to know who she is,” Gong Zeli said coldly. “I’m not here to discuss this with you. If you don’t get down to business, we can forget about it.”

Shen Rou’s expression stiffened again.
