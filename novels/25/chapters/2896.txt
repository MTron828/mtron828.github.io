Chapter 2897: She Really Wanted to Get Rid of Lin Huizhen

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Lin Huizhen knew, but she still pretended not to know. “I-I don’t know. But it’s good to have a job. With a job, you can earn money. Aren’t you short of money now?”

Qiao Anxin sneered. “Job? Haha, he asked me to accompany an old man. Is this work? Do you think I should go, or not?”

“This…” Lin Huizhen’s expression turned awkward. After a while, she said, “Of course, Mom doesn’t want you to go. Isn’t this insulting my daughter? But this is your business, Mom can’t make the decision for you.

“You should… decide for yourself.”

Qiao Anxin looked at how hypocritical she was and felt even more disgusted.

She was angry, disgusted, and upset.

Even though she already knew what kind of person Lin Huizhen was, she was still her biological mother and had doted on her since she was young.

She still had some hope for Lin Huizhen.

She thought that no matter how much Lin Huizhen loved money, her biological daughter was still a little more important.

But now, she was completely disappointed.

At this moment, she really wanted to get rid of Lin Huizhen.

Qiao Anxin was prepared to do it.

Lin Huizhen knew nothing except to cause trouble for her.

She wouldn’t keep a troublesome person by her side!

After making up her mind, Qiao Anxin took out a dress she usually liked to wear from her luggage. “Of course I’m going. Didn’t you say that we’re short of money now? If I don’t go, we’ll be sleeping on the streets in a few days.”

Lin Huizhen heaved a sigh of relief when she heard that.

She was afraid that Qiao Anxin wouldn’t go.

In the past, Lin Huizhen would never have allowed Qiao Anxin to do this.

Back then, the Su family hadn’t declined. Su Ze was still the Young Master of the Su family and was her golden husband.

She only wanted Qiao Anxin to marry into the Su family. She didn’t like anyone else.

Back then, she wanted Qiao Anxin to be gentle and pure.

She even made her wear conservative ones.

But now…

Lin Huizhen couldn’t wait to push Qiao Anxin towards those old men.

She even hoped that an old man would take a liking to her and be willing to provide for her. This way, they wouldn’t be short of money in the future.

But even though she thought so, she still pretended to be worried and felt bad for her daughter. She said with reddened eyes, “Anxin, I’m useless and can’t help you much. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have to…

“I’m sorry.”

As she spoke, she looked at Qiao Anxin’s expression and said, “How about you don’t go? Even if we really end up sleeping on the streets, it’s still better than you accompanying those old men.”

“Mom, what are you talking about?” Qiao Anxin turned around, grabbed Lin Huizhen’s hand, and said sincerely, “How could I bear to let you sleep on the streets and beg for food? Mom, I’m sorry. It’s my fault. I said something that upset you.

“Actually, I’m just going to have a meal and drink with those bosses. They’re very generous.. When I’m back, we’ll have money and can find a good neighborhood to live in.”VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔
