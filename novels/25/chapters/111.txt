Chapter 113: Shall We Have the Su Mandate Go Bankrupt Too?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

But as confident as he was, he had to admit that the mysterious man was a good catch.

Seeing the in-charge’s attitude, he knew that the man must be of great power and status.

He heard that the man was addressed as Mr. Mo...

Su Ze suddenly had a thought.

He was a young man by the surname Mo, could he be... the new Chairman of the Mo Corporation, who had just come back from overseas?!!

But this thought did not last for more than a second.

It was impossible.

Definitely impossible.

He heard that the Chairman of Mo Corporation had something called “Anti-Women Disorder”. He absolutely could not tolerate having women near him.

If he really was that Chairman, how could be that intimate with Qiao Mianmian?

Moreover, given Qiao Mianmian’s background, there was no way she could know him.

With that in mind, Su Ze felt slightly more at ease.

He would be in big trouble if he offended the Mo family.

In fact, he couldn’t think of a single person in the whole of Yuncheng City who could afford to do that.

...

After Su Ze left.

Mo Yesi saw that Qiao Mianmian still seemed unhappy. He tipped her chin up and looked down at her. “Still angry? It isn’t enough that we chased him out, huh. Shall we have the Su Mandate go bankrupt too?”

Qiao Mianmian widened her eyes.

If someone else said that, she would think they were joking.

But when Mo Yesi said that...

Qiao Mianmian fully believed he would do it.

He had that power.

“Let’s not,” Qiao Mianmian quickly said. “Although Su Ze and I have broken up, and I’m rather annoyed at him now, I feel that our matters shouldn’t involve his family. His parents... were nice to me.”

She meant it.

Su Ze’s parents had treated her well. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Especially his mother, who had loved her like she was her daughter.

Su Ze’s mother had always wanted a daughter, but she had trouble conceiving after having Su Ze.

Hence, he was her only child.

Without a daughter of her own, she pinned her hopes onto Qiao Mianmian.

Qiao Mianmian was disgusted by Su Ze, but she didn’t harbor ill feelings towards his parents.

Mo Yesi narrowed his eyes. “His parents treated you well?”

“Yup.”

The man looked slightly upset. “You like his parents a lot?”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned. It took her a while to realize that he wasn’t too happy with her.

“I’m... alright. I wouldn’t say I like them, but I surely don’t hate them.” She dared not speak the truth after sensing his unhappiness.

She was worried that he would flare up if she admitted it.

She was getting to know Mo Yesi a little better now. He always looked as if he didn’t bother about anything, but the truth was that he was rather petty about a lot of things.

The man’s expression softened when he heard her reply.

He rested his hand on her head. “You and Su Ze have already broken up, that makes him a stranger. In the future, it’d be best to minimize contact with him or his family.”

“Oh.” Qiao Mianmian nodded obediently. “I got it.”

In any case, she wouldn’t go wrong if she acted according to his wishes.

Mo Yesi seemed to be more at ease now.

He turned around and looked at Jiang Luoli, then scanned the surroundings. “Don’t you have two more roommates? Where are they?”
