Chapter 2645: I Really Don’t Think She’s Qualified to Win the Award

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

After getting permission, the emcee said, “The director and the judges have agreed. Next, you can each choose a song for the competition.”

“I’ll go first.”

Song Fei lifted her chin and walked onto the stage proudly. She said confidently, “I think the best way to showcase your strength is to sing acapella. So, I want to sing acapella for this competition.”

With that, she turned around and looked at Qiao Mianmian provocatively. “Can you sing acapella? If you think it’s difficult and you need a partner, then I…”

“Acapela? That’s it, then.” Before she could finish, Qiao Mianmian interrupted her coldly. “Don’t waste everyone’s time. Let’s begin.”

“You…” Song Fei was dissatisfied with her attitude. She wanted to say something, but when she thought about how she was still standing on stage, she bit her lip and endured it.

Hmph.

She would tolerate it for now!

She would make Qiao Mianmian cry!

Song Fei was confident in her singing skills.

She was chosen from a singing talent show. Without some capability, she wouldn’t make it to where she was today.

Back then, Song Fei won second place.

Because of this ranking, many things happened.

Her fans also felt that there was a conspiracy and thought that the champion should be Song Fei.

The fans didn’t approve of the final outcome and went to the champion’s Weibo to scold her. It was said that the girl who won the singing competition was scolded until she stopped using Weibo. She was depressed for a while and then went overseas to study to adjust her mentality.

Even now, the first place that should have gotten the best resources to debut was still overseas.

The resources that should have belonged to her were given to Song Fei. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Song Fei felt that she could easily beat Qiao Mianmian up.

She requested singing the acappella because she felt that Qiao Mianmian’s previous two songs were edited. Qiao Mianmian actually didn’t know how to sing, or she sang very averagely.

Once she sang the acapella, she would return to her original state.

Thinking that Qiao Mianmian would embarrass herself in front of the public, Song Fei felt extremely happy.

She wanted everyone to know that Qiao Mianmian wasn’t worthy of this award!

With this thought in mind, Song Fei didn’t prepare much and randomly picked a song to sing.

She chose a very easy song.

As she didn’t take it seriously, singing casually.

Although it was still good overall, it was only at the level of singing at a karaoke bar. It was still a distance away from a professional singer’s performance.

But Song Fei felt good about herself.

She felt that she could beat Qiao Mianmian even if she sang casually.

…

At this point, the netizens watching the live stream couldn’t help but complain when they heard Song Fei’s acappella.

“Is Song Fei serious? She made a fuss about how the results were unfair and asked for a new vote. I thought she would value this award so much and seriously choose a song. But… I really don’t think she’s qualified to win.”

“With all due respect, her standard is just average. She isn’t worthy of being called a professional singer.”

“I’ve heard the songs Song Fei sang during the competition. They were really good, but the song she chose today was really average..”
