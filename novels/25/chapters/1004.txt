Chapter 1005: Jealous

She wasn’t that mentally strong.

“Oh right, Mianmian. Can I ask you a question?” Jiang Luoli bit the straw and hesitated for a few seconds. She looked at Qiao Mianmian and asked softly, “I saw the scandal between you and the Young Master of the Gong family. Everyone said that he was the one who got someone to remove your trending topics. Is that true?”

Jiang Luoli didn’t believe that Qiao Mianmian was Gong Zeli’s mistress.

Her Baby was already married to an outstanding man like Prince Charming. She couldn’t possibly be involved with other men.

Even though the young master of the Gong family was very eligible.

But the male idol wasn’t too bad.

“What?!” Qiao Mianmian was confused. “What has this got to do with Gong Zeli?”

Jiang Luoli looked at her in confusion. “Don’t tell me you don’t know? You have a new trending topic. Ahem... it says you’re Young Master Gong’s lover and that he helped you settle everything today.”

“Bullshit!”

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but swear. “It has nothing to do with him. Who said I was his lover? Even if I wanted to find someone to keep me, I wouldn’t look for him!”

Jiang Luoli was speechless.

“So, Prince Charming helped you settle it?” Jiang Luoli had always been curious about Mo Yesi’s identity. She knew that Prince Charming wasn’t simple, but Qiao Mianmian still hadn’t told her about it.

Jiang Luoli felt that since it wasn’t convenient for her to say it, it must be awkward.

Hence, she didn’t ask anymore.

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian nodded. “Everything was done by him, it has nothing to do with Gong Zeli. I don’t know why there are so many scandals.”

She wondered if Mo Yesi had seen the scandal between her and Gong Zeli.

If he had already seen it...

He was probably going to get jealous again.

“Mianmian, Prince Charming... what exactly does he do?” Jiang Luoli couldn’t hold back her curiosity. “Of course, if you find it inconvenient to say it, just pretend I didn’t ask.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Actually, it’s not that inconvenient.” Qiao Mianmian decided not to hide it from Jiang Luoli anymore.

She used to worry too much because she felt that she wouldn’t be able to last long with Mo Yesi.

Hence, she didn’t want Jiang Luoli to know his true identity.

But now that she’d made up her mind to spend the rest of her life with Mo Yesi, she didn’t have so many concerns anymore.

Jiang Luoli was her best friend.

She didn’t have to worry too much in front of her.

After thinking it through, she said under Jiang Luoli’s expectant gaze, “You know his surname is Mo, right? He’s the new President of the Mo Corporation.”

“Pfft.”

Jiang Luoli spat out the water she was drinking.

It was a good thing she stopped herself in time. Otherwise, Qiao Mianmian would have been scolded by her.

“Baby, you... cough cough...” Jiang Luoli started coughing violently as if she had choked.

“Baby, is what you said true?” She stopped coughing after a while.

She looked at Qiao Mianmian in disbelief.

Qiao Mianmian nodded. “Mm, really.”
