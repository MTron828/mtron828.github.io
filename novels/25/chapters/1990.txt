Chapter 1992: This Is Discrimination, Serious Discrimination!

“Only the three of us are here. You’re not letting me speak. Do you want us to sit here all night?

“Moreover, I’m not the only one who thinks you’re too clingy to Sis-in-law. Lu Rao, tell me, do you think so too?”

Lu Rao glanced at him. “You’re not married, what do you know? When you have a wife in the future, you might be even more clingy than Ah Si.”

Yan Shaoqing said, “Pfft, I wouldn’t be like this. Didn’t you hear that marriage is the grave of love? How many people can remain in their honeymoon phase after getting married? Moreover, Lu Rao, you don’t have a wife. You’re so understanding.

“If I don’t understand, how can you?”

Lu Rao smiled. “Who told you I don’t have a wife?”

“Damn.” Yan Shaoqing jumped up from the sofa. “What do you mean?”

“Exactly.” Lu Rao smiled again.

“Don’t tell me you’re married?” Yan Shaoqing widened his eyes in disbelief. “You don’t even have a girlfriend, how can you be married? I don’t believe it.”

Lu Rao rolled his eyes at him and said calmly, “It doesn’t matter if you believe it or not. Since this was mentioned, I’ll let you know in advance. You should have time for my wedding at the end of next month, right? Remember to come.”

“Damn!” Yan Shaoqing was stunned. “You’re really married? Are you kidding? Who are you married to? Why didn’t you tell us about this? Are you really talking about marriage?”

“What do you think?” Lu Rao said.

“But why did you get married without a word?” Yan Shaoqing was still in disbelief. “You didn’t reveal anything to us. Who is the bride? Do we know her? Does your family know about this?”

“I didn’t tell you because she and I went to get our marriage certificate yesterday. She’s just a teacher from an ordinary high school, you don’t know her. Even my family only found out about this yesterday, but they liked her and accepted us.

“I’ll bring her out to meet you guys someday. She’s timid and shy. Yan Shaoqing, you have to behave yourself and not bring anyone you shouldn’t.”

Yan Shaoqing was speechless.

Why did they all look at him with disdain?

Mo Yesi didn’t allow him to bring women.

Lu Rao didn’t allow him to bring women.

Moreover, the reason was the same. Their little cutie would be unhappy if she saw them.

Yan Shaoqing was furious.

Would he bring an indecent woman?!

“Lu Rao, you’re really married?” Mo Yesi was also shocked by this news.

“Mm.” Lu Rao smiled. “I didn’t think of getting married so soon. But plans can’t keep up with changes. But I’m willing to accept such changes now. Ah Si, I finally understand why you married Mianmian so quickly.

“If I meet the right person, I’ll want to settle her down as soon as possible. Otherwise, what if someone else takes her away?”

Mo Yesi smiled. “It’s not bad to settle it early. I have to congratulate you.”
