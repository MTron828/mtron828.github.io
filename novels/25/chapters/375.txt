Chapter 378: You Don’t Need a Reason to Hate Someone

Her eyes seemed to be glowing.

The girl had her chin tipped up and was looking at him from such a close distance. Her features were so beautiful that his heart skipped a beat.

And her make-up was so light that she was practically bare-faced.

And yet, she looked so much more beautiful than many of the women who’d had a makeover.

With his status, Gong Zeli had been around many pretty ladies.

He knew all types of women, of all sizes.

And also Shen Rou, whom he’d grown up with.

Even so, he was still awe-struck by Qiao Mianmian.

Qiao Mianmian’s beauty was very different from Shen Rou’s.

Shen Rou was good-looking in a loud, striking manner, and she wasn’t gentle enough.

She caught the eyes of many, but she often made them feel as if she was too outstanding and assertive.

But Qiao Mianmian was different.

There was nothing aggressive about Qiao Mianmian. She exuded an air that made people very comfortable.

She looked somewhat like a model student, and this made people think back about their first love in their younger days.

And her charisma was very pure. After all, she hadn’t entered the adult world yet, so she was still young, raw, and untainted.

Gong Zeli had seen many beautiful women, but this was the first time he saw one like Qiao Mianmian.

She was so close.

He could smell her sweet scent.

The air around her was clean, pure, and so very refreshing.

It smelt good.

“Tell me.” Qiao Mianmian was so angry. “What did I do to offend you? We’ve never had any conflict before, don’t you think your actions towards me are strange and uncalled for?

“Is it just because you think I’m not good enough for Mo Yesi? Or is it because of Shen Rou? You’re feeling bad for your friend?”

It was because he and Shen Rou were close friends who grew up together.

And he knew that Shen Rou liked Mo Yesi.

The group of friends wished that Mo Yesi and Shen Rou would get together.

But in the end, Mo Yesi had married her instead.

So, was he taking revenge for Shen Rou, in some sense?

Qiao Mianmian felt that this was the most plausible reason.

Otherwise, Gong Zeli wouldn’t view her as an arch-enemy.

Upon hearing Shen Rou’s name, Gong Zeli’s expression changed instantly, as if he’d come back to his senses. The confusion in his eyes was quickly replaced by ferocity again.

He looked at the woman who was less than half a meter away from him and felt a strange sensation.

Just like the moment that had passed.

It felt oddly familiar.

Qiao Mianmian felt oddly familiar to him.

He couldn’t pinpoint what about her it was, but that feeling vanished as soon as it came.

He seemed lost. After eyeing Qiao Mianmian for a while more, he took two steps back.

“You don’t need a reason to hate someone.” He frowned upon recalling that strange sensation and a weird and abstract image came to mind.

It depicted him at his 10th birthday party. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

He and Shen Rou had argued over something trivial. He’d gotten angry and hid in the backyard, not wanting to see anyone.

And then something happened, and he ended up falling into the pool.

He called for help for a long time, but nobody heard him.

He sank bit by bit until he could no longer call for help. Just as he thought he was going to drown to death, he saw a white figure swimming towards him.
