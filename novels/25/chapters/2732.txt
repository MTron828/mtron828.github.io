Chapter 2735: Why Are You Here?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“How could that be? I was bored at home today when I received your call. It’s better to go out for a walk than to be alone at home.”

“Is that so?” The familiar voice was full of smiles. “That’s good, I’m just afraid you’ll feel bored.”

“Auntie, are you buying something for your granddaughter?”

“Mm, I want to see her tomorrow.”

“But didn’t Auntie say that your conflict with your daughter-in-law hasn’t been resolved? If you go over, will she be unhappy and not let you meet your granddaughter?”

“Hmph, that’s the Mo family’s bloodline. As her grandmother, I have the right to meet her. What right does she have to stop me from seeing my granddaughter?”

“That’s true.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Their voices were getting closer and closer to her.

Qiao Mianmian heard footsteps behind her and stopped.

“Eh?”

“What’s wrong?”

“Oh, this lady looks familiar. She looks a little like Aunt’s other daughter-in-law.”

“Let me see…”

A few seconds later.

“Qiao Mianmian?” A puzzled voice sounded. Before Qiao Mianmian could respond, the person standing behind her had already circled around her.

It was Madam Mo.

After all, she was her daughter-in-law.

Even though most of Qiao Mianmian’s face was covered, Madam Mo quickly recognized her.

Although Madam Mo was no longer dissatisfied with Qiao Mianmian’s family background after she was acknowledged by the Bai family, Qiao Mianmian always protected Jiang Luoli, causing Madam Mo, who didn’t like Jiang Luoli, to dislike her too.

Madam Mo’s gentle expression immediately changed when she recognized her.

Although her expression wasn’t cold, it definitely wasn’t good.

“Qiao Mianmian, it’s you. Why are you here?”

Qiao Mianmian glanced at her, then turned to look at Tang Ya, who was standing behind her, before looking back at Madam Mo.

She didn’t expect Madam Mo and Tang Ya to still be in contact.

And their relationship was obviously as good as ever.

Didn’t she know that Tang Ya was secretly targeting the Mo Corporation?

She didn’t seem to know.

“Mom, I’m here to buy some baby products.” Qiao Mianmian felt that Madam Mo was asking the obvious.

“Baby products? Who are they for, Jiang Luoli’s child?” Madam Mo couldn’t help but frown at the mention of Jiang Luoli.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but defend her best friend and rebutted Madam Mo in an unpleasant tone. “That’s Big Brother’s child, your biological granddaughter. Mom, why are you here too?”

Madam Mo’s face stiffened. Just as she was about to speak, Tang Ya walked over and held her hand. “Auntie wants to buy something for her granddaughter. I didn’t expect to meet Miss Qiao here.

“Miss Qiao bought these baby products for Miss Jiang too, right? Since we happened to bump into each other, why don’t you help Auntie pick a gift? I heard that you and Miss Jiang are very good friends. You must know her well and know what to give her.”

Qiao Mianmian turned to look at her and said calmly, “Miss Tang, you might have misunderstood.”
