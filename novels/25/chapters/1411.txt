Chapter 1414: The Mo Family Is Too Hateful

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“She was delayed by something and is probably still on the way.” Bai Yusheng sized Qiao Mianmian up from top to bottom and said gently, “Mianmian, you’re very beautiful today. This dress suits you very well.”

“What’s going on?” Yan Shaoqing was confused. “Sis-in-law, you and Bai Yusheng are...”

The Bai family didn’t announce that their daughter had been found.

Mo Yesi had never told Yan Shaoqing that Qiao Mianmian was the daughter the Bai family had been looking for.

Hence, few people knew about Qiao Mianmian’s relationship with the Bai family.

Yan Shaoqing had no idea.

“It’s a long story. I’ll tell you when I’m free.” Bai Yusheng didn’t intend to explain it to him now.

They stood together for a while.

Shen Rou stood at the side like an outsider.

She had never felt so aggrieved and neglected before.

Seeing that no one was paying attention to her, Shen Rou felt humiliated.

She glared at Qiao Mianmian.

At this moment, Madam Shen walked over.

“Rourou, come with me. Your Aunt Cheng’s son is back from overseas and he’s attending the banquet tonight. I’ll bring you over. You can get to know each other,” Madam Shen said as she held Shen Rou’s hand.

“Mom, I don’t want to go.” Shen Rou resisted.

She looked at Madam Shen resentfully and said with reddened eyes, “Mom, I don’t want to stay here anymore. I want to go home.”

“You just came, why are you going back? Your Aunt Cheng’s son is very outstanding. I’ve helped you take a look just now. He’s a rather handsome young man. Although he’s a little short, he’s not much shorter than you. As long as he has a good character and treats you well, his height isn’t a problem. Come with me to meet him first.” How could Madam Shen not know that her daughter had been wronged? But with the Shen family’s current situation, she had no choice.

Her daughter was important.

But the company was more important.

For the company, no matter how reluctant she was, she had to make some sacrifices.

Mo Yesi made a condition. As long as they could marry their daughter off within a month, they were willing to help the Shen family recover.

The Mo family was the only hope of the Shen family now.

The Shen Corporation couldn’t go bankrupt.

Hence, they could only follow Mo Yesi’s request and marry Shen Rou off as soon as possible.

This was also the reason why Shen Rou had been going on blind dates.

She thought it was a simple matter. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

But unexpectedly...

People nowadays were all very realistic. Those families who used to curry favor with the Shen family and wanted to marry their daughter were now avoiding them.

No one dared to accept the princess of the Shen family.

At this thought, Madam Shen’s eyes were filled with resentment.

The Mo family was too hateful.

The two families had been friends for so many years, but now her daughter was forced into this state.

The most hateful person was Mo Yesi.

Her Rourou had liked him for so many years. It was fine if he wasn’t touched, but now he was forcing them to marry Rourou.

Madam Shen’s heart ached for her daughter, but she couldn’t compromise.

She lowered her voice and tried to persuade Shen Rou. “Rourou, listen to me. Whether you like it or not, you have to go and see him first, alright? If you want to go back later, we’ll go back first.”

Shen Rou bit her lip.
