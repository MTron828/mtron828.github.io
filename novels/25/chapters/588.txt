Chapter 589: Even You Are Trying to Steal Gong Zeli From Me?

However, his phone suddenly rang.

It interrupted his question.

His face changed as he checked it and immediately answered the call.

“Hello.”

“Alright, I’ll be right there.”

As he hung up, Gong Zeli took a long look at Qiao Mianmian and then said, “Miss Qiao, I have something to attend to. Let’s chat another day.” He then left in a hurry.

Qiao Mianmian was still confused.

After a while, the car that she booked had also arrived.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t want to put too much thought into Gong Zeli’s strange behavior. She texted Mo Yesi and was on her way to the Mo Corporation.

Just as the car left, a red Maserati appeared. Shen Rou was inside, biting her lip as she looked coldly at the car Qiao Mianmian was in joined the traffic.

“Qiao Mianmian.”

As she bit on her lip, she clenched tightly on the steering wheel. There was a cold look in her eyes as she whispered, “You’re even trying to steal Gong Zeli from me? Don’t force me to resort to other means.”

...

When Qiao Mianmian arrived at the Mo Corporation, Wei Zheng was there to pick her up.

Wei Zheng was especially happy to see her. As she got out of the car, he greeted her enthusiastically. “Young Madam.”

“Don’t be so loud.”

Qiao Mianmian said as she looked around. She then whispered, “Just address me as Miss Qiao in the company.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Don’t need to worry, Young Madam. No one heard it,” Wei Zheng replied as he also looked around. He then smiled and whispered, “Chairman Mo is in a meeting now. But he has instructed me to bring you to the office in the meantime.

“I have prepared some snacks for you. You can have some if you’re hungry. He will bring you out for dinner after he’s done with the meeting.

“If it’s too boring, you can shop around in the mall next door. I can accompany you.”

“I think I will wait for him in the office.”

Qiao Mianmian thought for a while before continuing smilingly, “There’s nothing that I want to buy. I’m too lazy to shop.”

Wei Zheng was left speechless.

It was the first time he encountered such a young madam.

She didn’t like to shop.

If it were other women, they would’ve chosen shopping without hesitation.

They would have bought shoes, heels, jewelry...

They would buy anything they could get their hands on.

Money wasn’t an issue for Chairman Mo, after all.

His credit cards wouldn’t be rejected no matter how much they bought.

But Young Madam...

She was really trying to save money for Chairman Mo.

Any ordinary man would be really happy to have a wife like her.

But as for their Chairman Mo...

He would feel like a failure instead.

Wei Zheng wanted to convince Qiao Mianmian to go for the shopping trip. He thought for a while before tempting her. “Young Madam, are you sure about not going to the mall? I’ve heard that the major brands are having an end-of-season sale. I have a VIP card for the mall which gives us up to a 50% discount. It’s a steal.”

Qiao Mianmian was about to enter the lift when she heard that.

She stopped in her tracks, turned around, and asked, “50% discount? Are you sure?”

Wei Zheng felt a strong sense of accomplishment at successfully sparking her interest. He immediately nodded and replied, “Yes, I’m sure. Young Madam, I think you should go on the shopping trip instead? The meeting just started, and it will take another hour before it ends. It would be really boring for you to be alone in the office. It’ll be a better choice for you to shop around...”
