Chapter 1526: He Deleted Me Just Now

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

It was nothing.

The next second, Mo Yesi’s handsome face darkened when he saw Qiao Mianmian’s reply.

Qiao Mianmian’s game ID was the same as her WeChat name: “Mianmian isn’t soft and cute”.

Her reply was: [Alright. But Little Brother, aren’t you afraid that I’ll cheat you? Do you want to play with this rookie who only knows how to shout 666?]

The other person replied: [That’s great, I just need someone who can shout 666.]

The two of them were flirting with each other.

Even though Mo Yesi knew that Qiao Mianmian didn’t have any other intentions, he was still jealous.

He was jealous.

She actually called someone else Little Brother.

She had never called him Little Brother.

The more Mo Yesi thought about it, the angrier he got. He wanted to snatch her cell phone and immediately delete the game, but when he recalled that she’d said that he’d already made her feel pressured, he hesitated for a few seconds and dismissed the thought.

He pursed his lips and held it in.

He waited until Qiao Mianmian was done with her game.

Then, he saw that the person who said he wanted to take Qiao Mianmian flying sent an invitation to continue playing games with her.

Qiao Mianmian was about to accept it when she saw a hand take her cell phone away.

She looked up and saw Mo Yesi standing beside the sofa with a dark expression. He took her cell phone and tapped on the screen.

He then returned the cell phone to her.

Qiao Mianmian looked down and asked, “What did you do?”

Mo Yesi sat down beside her. “I rejected it for you. If you want someone to bring you up, there’s one here. Your husband’s playing isn’t worse than others, why don’t you ask me to play with you?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She was still online and saw the private message from the boy who was ranked with her.

Sword Immortal Xiao Yao: [Sister, do you... have a husband?] Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Mianmian looked up at Mo Yesi.

She could guess how he rejected him.

She thought for a while and replied: [Mm, my husband came to look for me after he was done with his work. Little Brother, I’m sorry. My husband is a jealous lover. He doesn’t like me playing games with other guys. I’m going to delete you from the friends’ list.]

Sword Immortal Xiao Yao: [... Alright, I wish you happiness.]

The boy took the initiative to delete Qiao Mianmian after replying.

Qiao Mianmian raised her cell phone as if she was handing in a mission. “I’ve already deleted him. The boy I played with today is only 16 years old. He’s not even an adult yet. I just felt that he played well, so I wanted to play a few more rounds with him.

“You can’t be jealous of an underage boy.”

“Underage?” Mo Yesi narrowed his eyes.

“Mm, underage.”

“You’re calling him an underage boy?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

So, he saw her conversation?

No wonder his expression was dark just now.

“Uh, that’s not the point.” Qiao Mianmian’s lips twitched. “Little Brother is just a term. You saw it too, he deleted me just now.”

Qiao Mianmian sounded aggrieved.

The little boy was really good at the game.

She took a look and realized that the boy was really Li Bai, one of the top ten in the province.

Qiao Mianmian’s favorite Honor of Kings assassin was Li Bai.

After all, he was known as the most handsome hero in the fabled canyon maps.
