She thought that Mo Yunchen wanted her to stay.

She even felt a hint of joy and anticipation.

She thought that if he asked her, she would be willing to stay. In the future, besides taking care of her husband and raising her children, she wouldn’t interfere in matters that she shouldn’t.

She would never... be silly again.

She was so disappointed.

Her eyes were filled with tears and regret. “Yunchen, do we still have a chance to be together in the future? If I’m willing to change... if I don’t do anything to make you angry again, will we still have a chance to be together?

“Can I still... be your wife?”

Besides Mo Yunchen, who else would pamper her forever?

Who could be more outstanding than him?

Madam Mo knew that she wouldn’t be able to find a better man.

She wouldn’t look for someone else.

She only had one husband in this life, and that was Mo Yunchen.

Even if they were divorced, he was still her husband, and she would only acknowledge him in this lifetime.

Mo Yunchen sighed and said gently, “Wenpei, whether we can be together in the future or not, you’re my only wife. I can’t answer your questions just now, but I think anything is possible.”

Madam Mo’s eyes lit up again when she heard his last sentence.

“Tl wait for you.” She sobbed. “T’ll reflect on myself and change everything. Yunchen, I’ll always be waiting for you. No matter how long it takes.”

Madam Mo wiped the tears off her face and slowly turned around. She looked at her two sons and daughters-in-law standing not far behind her and hesitated. After a few seconds, she slowly walked towards them.

She walked towards Jiang Luoli with guilt in her eyes. After a while, she said apologetically, “Luoli, I-I want to apologize to you. I know an apology won’t change anything. I’ve done so much to you, I can’t just ask you to forgive me.”

She spoke slowly. “But I still want to apologize to you. This time, I... I really know my mistake. I’ve let you down, and I’ve let Yueyue down. I’m not a good mother-in-law, much less a good grandmother.”

Jiang Luoli looked at the humble Madam Mo with her head lowered.

Of course, she wouldn’t forgive her so easily.

But at this moment, Madam Mo didn’t seem so hateful.

She didn’t know if Madam Mo really regretted it, but she couldn’t forgive her.

She wasn’t a magnanimous person. Moreover, her daughter was almost hurt because of her. She still felt afraid when she thought about it.

Jiang Luoli pursed her lips and kept quiet.

Madam Mo knew that she wouldn’t forgive her easily. Thinking back on what she’d done, even she couldn’t forgive herself, let alone others.

If someone treated her and her child this way, would she forgive them just because they apologized?

Of course not.

Thus, she didn’t dare to ask for forgiveness..
