Chapter 2289: She Asked for It!

“Mo Shixiu, is that you?”

After a while, Jiang Luoli’s voice could be heard from inside.

“It’s me.” Mo Shixiu lowered his voice. “Luoli, I’m back.”

The door opened.

Jiang Luoli didn’t care if someone was standing outside. She rushed into Mo Shixiu’s arms and hugged him.

“Mo Shixiu, you’re finally back.” She looked up, her eyes red.

Mo Shixiu was stunned for a while before hugging her gently.

He lowered his head and kissed her forehead. Seeing her reddened eyes, his heart ached. His voice softened as he coaxed her softly. “Mm, don’t be afraid. I’m back. With me around, no one can hurt you.”

Mo Shixiu checked her carefully. After confirming that she was fine, he heaved a sigh of relief.

Madam Mo looked at the two of them hugging as if no one was around.

This vixen.

She was still present, and she was already throwing herself at her son.

If she wasn’t around, wouldn’t this vixen seduce her son?

Seeing how much Mo Shixiu treasured Jiang Luoli, Madam Mo felt uncomfortable. She couldn’t help but say sarcastically, “Who are you showing this aggrieved look to? Do you mean that I’ve wronged you?

“I didn’t do anything to you. Don’t talk nonsense in front of Shixiu.”

Mo Shixiu turned around with Jiang Luoli in his arms.

Madam Mo immediately kept quiet when she met his gaze.

Mo Shixiu had never looked at her with such a cold and strange gaze.

Madam Mo immediately felt guilty.

“Luoli, what’s wrong with your face? When I left this morning, your face was fine. Why is one side of your face so swollen now?” Mo Shixiu asked Jiang Luoli, but his eyes were on Madam Mo.

Mo Shixiu’s voice was very calm, but the veins on his forehead and his clenched fists showed his true emotions.

At this moment, Madam Mo was very sure. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

If this person wasn’t her son, she would have been slapped.

Realizing this, Madam Mo was upset and angry.

Didn’t she just slap that vixen?

Wasn’t it normal for a mother-in-law to teach her daughter-in-law a lesson?

When she was young, she had also suffered at Old Madam’s hands.

How could she not feel aggrieved at all?

Jiang Luoli moved her lips and was about to speak when Madam Mo said angrily, “I hit her. I’m her mother-in-law, and she did something wrong. Can’t I discipline her?”

Mo Yesi’s eyes turned cold. “Mom, you hit her?”

“Yes, I hit her.” Madam Mo looked as her son defended the vixen and felt upset. She said angrily, “It’s because of her that your bright future is ruined. Everyone says that a virtuous man has to marry a virtuous woman. This woman not only didn’t help her husband at all, but she even harmed you. Shouldn’t I hit her? Even if I kill her, she asked for it!”

When she said the word “kill”, the surrounding temperature dropped drastically.
