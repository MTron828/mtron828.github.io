Chapter 2211: Suddenly Taken Away

Shen Rou and Chairman Chen stiffened. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Everyone looked in the direction of the voice.

At the front row, Mo Yesi calmly raised his bidding sign.

Seeing that, Yan Shaoqing smiled. “I knew it. Second Bro, I knew you’d definitely make a move. But you’re too ruthless. If you were a second later, this jewelry set would have become someone else’s.”

“Mo Yesi, what are you doing?” Qiao Mianmian tugged at his sleeve and winked at him. “Didn’t I tell you that I don’t want it? Why are you bidding for it?”

She lowered her voice so that only the two of them could hear.

Mo Yesi looked down at her. “Don’t you like it?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She did like it, but she’d told him that she simply thought it was nice and that she appreciated it.

This prodigal!

This was 30 million, not thirty thousand!

“Take it if you like it.” Mo Yesi rubbed her head and smiled affectionately. “Moreover, I don’t want others to call me a miser toward the woman I love. It’s fine if they say I’m nothing, but I won’t allow others to laugh at you.

“No one laughs at my woman.”

Although Mo Yesi couldn’t hear them clearly, he did hear some of them.

As he said, he didn’t care what others thought of him.

But he couldn’t tolerate others laughing at Qiao Mianmian.

“Impressive, really impressive.” Yan Shaoqing gave him a thumbs up. “Second Bro, I just realized that you’re even mushier than me when you say sweet nothings. I’m impressed by your self-taught skills.”

Mo Yesi glared at him expressionlessly.

“30 million. Mr. Mo has offered 30 million. Is there anyone willing to bid higher?” The auctioneer’s excited voice sounded again.

Mo Yesi’s bid surprised and shocked everyone.

The women who were envious of Shen Rou turned to look at Qiao Mianmian.

“Who was the one who said that Mo Yesi wasn’t willing to spend on Qiao Mianmian? I knew it. Chairman Mo doesn’t lack money the most. Why would he be unwilling to spend tens of millions?”

“Did you see that? Shen Rou’s face seems to have turned green. She must be furious. She thought that the jewelry was hers, but it was suddenly taken away.”

“Do you think Young Master Chen will continue bidding for it? If he’s unwilling, wouldn’t Shen Rou lose face if Mo Yesi takes the jewelry set?”

“Continue? Isn’t that embarrassing? In terms of money, who can compare to the Mo family?”

“That depends on how much he values Shen Rou. Is he willing to spend a huge sum to fight for her face?”

Shen Rou didn’t expect Mo Yesi to do this at the last moment.

She was stunned for a while before coming back to her senses.

Chairman Chen was also shocked.

Mo Yesi immediately offered 30 million yuan.

That 20 million yuan was already enough to make Chairman Chen’s heart ache.

He hesitated when the auctioneer asked if anyone was bidding higher.
