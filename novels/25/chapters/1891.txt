Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

He had given her the best husband in the world.

She felt very happy now.

She had a new family and a loving husband. Soon, she would have a cute baby.

Getting married and having children at this age was not her plan.

But now, she really liked this accident.

“Mo Shixiu.” Jiang Luoli leaned into his arms and called him softly.

“Yes.” Mo Shixiu lowered his head and waited for her to speak with gentle eyes.

Jiang Luoli reached out to hold his face. “Will you always be so good to me?”

“Yes,” Mo Shixiu answered without hesitation.

“You won’t change?”

“I won’t.”

“If you don’t like me one day...”

“That day will never come.” Mo Shixiu interrupted her. “Luoli, you don’t have to worry about these things. I’m the one who should worry, not you.”

“What are you worried about?” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Mo Shixiu was silent for a few seconds before saying, “I’m just as worried as you are.”

“Are you worried that... I won’t like you one day?”

“Yeah.”

Jiang Luoli: “...”

She had no idea that he would be so worried.

She had thought that this was just her worry.

After all, their conditions were too different. His conditions were too good, while hers were too bad.

“Then, you don’t have to worry about it.” Jiang Luoli held his face and said, “Because this day will definitely not come.”

She only knew that her feelings for him were getting deeper and deeper.

She liked him more and more.

Mo Shixiu was stunned. A smile appeared on the man’s handsome face, and a gentle smile emerged in his eyes. “Can I interpret this sentence as a confession?”

“Of course you can.” Jiang Luoli did not avoid his gaze. She looked at the man in front of her steadily. “Mo Shixiu, are you stupid? If I didn’t like you, would I marry you? Although I like good-looking men, I’m not willing to marry someone just because of his looks.”

The man’s gaze became even gentler.

“Luoli.” He gently called her name and held one of her hands. He solemnly promised, “I will treat you well. I will never let you down in this life.”

“Yes, I believe you.” Jiang Luoli smiled sweetly and made a promise to him. “Mo Shixiu, I will treat you well too. If you don’t let me down, I will never let you down in this life. But if you let me down, I will definitely leave you.

“I will leave you without hesitation. I will never look back.”

Even if her heart broke into pieces, she would leave without hesitation.

Her love world was very small and she could not tolerate any betrayal.

...

After dinner.

Qiao Mianmian brought Mo Yesi around the town.

“It’s getting late. We’ll go back now. Pack your things.” Mo Yesi brought her up again.

“Mo Yesi, I really want to stay and continue participating in this show.” Qiao Mianmian decided to have a good talk with him. She didn’t want to leave just like that. “Can I stay? I promise that nothing dangerous will happen again. Can you just let me stay here? I really don’t want to leave just like that.”

She looked at him pitifully and said, “Mo Yesi, you’re the best. Just let me stay, okay?”
