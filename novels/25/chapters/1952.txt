Chapter 1953: Mo Yesi Still Has Such Confidence

As expected, when she said that, a smile appeared on the man’s handsome face.

He was obviously pleased by her words.

Qiao Mianmian pressed on and kissed him on the cheek. “Hubby, you’re the best man in the world. After marrying you, I won’t fancy any other man.

“I’m not blind. Even if I really want to cheat on you, I should at least find someone similar or better than you, right? But how can there be someone better than you in this world? Don’t you think so?”

She then blinked and looked at him affectionately.

Mo Yesi frowned when he heard the word “cheating”, but after she finished speaking, his expression darkened.

Her face brightened immediately.

“I didn’t suspect you.” He patted Qiao Mianmian’s head and said gently, “I saw what you said on the way here. Don’t worry, I didn’t believe a word they said.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “You’ve seen it?”

“Yeah.”

“You really didn’t suspect anything?”

“Heh.” The man chuckled and said in a contemptuous tone, “How can a woman who has been loved by a lion take a fancy to a wild dog? Su Ze has never been a threat to me.”

Mo Yesi was confident.

Su Ze was no longer a threat to him.

Qiao Mianmian would never fall for Su Ze after following him.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Su Ze was never a threat to him?

Who was the man who used to mind Su Ze so much and get jealous over him?

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t be bothered to expose him, as long as he believed that there was nothing between her and Su Ze.

Nothing else mattered.

“But we still have to investigate this matter properly.” Mo Yesi narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “We have to find out who secretly took your photo.”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t retort.

She also wanted to know who had secretly taken those photos and sent them to the media.

This matter was not difficult to investigate.

She had even guessed who it might be.

The person who took the photo was also at the hotel last night. Since they secretly took a photo of her and Su Ze, they must have known about her relationship with him.

Last night, after Qiao Mianmian returned to the room, she remembered that Qiao Anxin wasn’t there.

Not long after she returned to the private room, Qiao Anxin returned.

All sorts of analyses were put together, and the answer was obvious.

But since Mo Yesi said he wanted to investigate, she would let him.

Although the matter between her and Su Ze was false, Qiao Mianmian still felt that she should clarify things when she saw that the trending topic was getting more and more heated.

Otherwise, this matter would only become more and more ridiculous.

After pondering for a moment, she posted on Weibo.

Qiao Mianmian V: “There’s no such thing as a ‘rekindle of old flame’. It’s just a rumor. Please delete all the untrue comments on the post about this rumor. Otherwise, I’ll file a lawsuit.”

Qiao Mianmian posted on Weibo, and her fans replied excitedly. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Mianmian, you’re finally willing to clarify things. We knew that you wouldn’t get back together with Scumbag Su.”

“Supporting Sister Mianmian to use legal weapons to protect her rights.”

“Sister Mianmian, although I like you a lot, if you get back together with Scumbag Su, I won’t like you anymore.”
