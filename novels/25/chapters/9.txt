The rate of recovery was as high as 90%?

Qiao Mianmian’s gradually sinking heart instantly raised hope. She immediately asked, “But what? President, is this person you know a doctor in this hospital?”

“No.” Lu Rao shook his head. “He’s a businessman that hasn’t been in the medical field for many years. That’s why I said he might not help.”

The ray of hope that had just been ignited at the bottom of her heart fell down again.

Not a doctor for many years?

Would he still perform surgery on Qiao Chen?

But... 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Even if she only had one percent hope, she could not give up.

Qiao Chen was her only loved one in this world.

No matter what method was used, she would fight for him.

“President, you, can you give me that person’s contact information?” After a moment of contemplation, Qiao Mianmian looked at him pleadingly and said nervously, “I want to talk to him.”

A look of delight flashed across Lu Rao’s eyes very quickly, but he pretended to look uncomfortable.

After a few seconds of silence, he nodded and said, “Well, I’ll give you his contact information and address. But when you meet him, you can’t tell him that I sent you.”

Qiao Mianmian’s face showed joy. “Thank you!”

The Mo house.

Looking at the towering building in front of her, Qiao Mianmian stood outside the revolving glass door and was timid for a moment.

But when she thought of Qiao Chen, she plucked up her courage again.

After taking a deep breath, she stepped in.

As soon as she reached the front desk, she was stopped.

The female staff at the front desk were two beautiful women with good figures, exquisite makeup on their faces, and several luxury brand jewelry on them.

At first glance, their temperament resembled that of wealthy women.

When one of the female employees saw Qiao Mianmian’s beautiful appearance, she became somewhat hostile.

Seeing that she was dressed very ordinarily, she said arrogantly, “Miss, you have to register to find someone. Who are you looking for?”

Qiao Mianmian hesitated and said the name Lu Rao had given her. “Hello, I want to find Mo Yesi, is he here?”

As soon as she said this, she heard two inhaling sounds.

The female employee, whose attitude was not very good, was even more hostile. She was almost glaring at her. “Who are you to call Chairman Mo by his name. You have to have an appointment to see Chairman Mo, or you won’t be able to meet him.”

Chairman Mo?

Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

Was the man named Mo Yesi the top of the company?

Looking at the reactions of the two front desk employees, his positions shouldn’t be low.

She said honestly, “I don’t have an appointment.”

“Ha.” The female employee sneered dismissively when she heard that. “Chairman Mo doesn’t see anyone randomly. You don’t have an appointment, but you want to see Chairman Mo? Some women these days really have thick skin. They want to climb the dragon and attach to the phoenix with just a little bit of appearance. You think you can get closer to Chairman Mo so easily?”

Qiao Mianmian frowned.

She patiently explained, “I think you have misunderstood me. I didn’t...”

But before she finished speaking, she was interrupted impatiently by the female employee. “We don’t have any interest in hearing what you think. In short, Chairman Mo will never see you without an appointment. You can go now.”
