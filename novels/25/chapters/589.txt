Chapter 591: He Was Despised So Much It Made Him Afraid

Hearing the sound of the door opening on the other side, looking at the time, Qiao Mianmian asked gently, “You finished your meeting?”

“Yup.”

Mo Yesi pushed open the door to his office on the other end and felt slightly upset when he didn’t see his wife waiting for him on the sofa as expected. He said slightly grudgingly, “Why aren’t you in my office? Where did you go? Didn’t you say you would wait for me?”

“I went to the mall to do some shopping.” Qiao Mianmian immediately started pacifying him. “I bought you a present. Just wait for me for a few minutes, I will be back immediately.”

“You bought me a gift?” Mo Yesi’s tone lightened with surprise and joy.

Qiao Mianmian knew she managed to pacify him.

She pressed her lips together, trying to resist the urge to laugh out loud. Clearing her throat, she smiled. “Yup. But... I’m not sure if you will like it...”

“I like it.”

The low yet gentle voice spoke happily even before she could finish her sentence. “As long as it’s a gift from you, I’ll like it. What did you get for me, Baby?”

That sentence of “As long as it’s a gift from you, I’ll like it” made Qiao Mianmian’s heart thump with happiness.

Her lips curled up at the edges. “It’s a secret. I will let you take a look at it later.”

“Alright, I’ll wait for you.”

...

Back at the company.

Just as Qiao Mianmian walked into the office, she was immediately pulled into a warm and strong embrace.

Before she could react, the man lifted her chin, and a pair of warm and moist lips pressed down on hers.

“Uhm.”

She waved her hands in the air helplessly as she saw the half-open door at the side of her eyes, along with a red-faced and wide-eyed Wei Zheng standing there with bags in his hands. Her face immediately flushed red.

She lowered her hands to his chest to give him a slight push.

This kiss wasn’t long.

It went on only for a few seconds before Mo Yesi let go of her.

But the kiss was strong and hard.

Even though it was just a few seconds, Qiao Mianmian’s lips were red and swollen.

She wiped her numb lips as she embarrassedly glared at him. She couldn’t even bring herself to look straight at Wei Zheng.

Mo Yesi’s lips curled up into a smirk as he hugged the soft and fragrant-smelling girl. Lifting his gaze, he finally saw Wei Zheng standing at the door, not knowing whether to enter or to leave. His gaze darkened as he asked matter-of-factly, “What are you still standing there for? Are your legs glued to the floor?”

Wei Zheng’s expression turned wronged as he lifted the bags. “President Mo, can I enter to put these bags down first before I leave?”

Mo Yesi finally saw the bags and frowned with despise. He walked into the office with Qiao Mianmian still in his arms. “Place them on the table and leave.”

“Okay...”

Feeling that he was being an eyesore, Wei Zheng walked into the office with a gloomy face, placed the things down, and walked away with an even more sullen face.

He felt heartache.

As President Mo’s special personal assistant for years, he always felt like he had a very important and strong presence.

Ever since President Mo got married, he would always feel like he was the extra and unnecessary one whenever Madam was around.

President Mo always looked at him with a face full of disgust.

He was despised so much by him that he was afraid.

Afraid that President Mo would suddenly banish him to another country the next second.
