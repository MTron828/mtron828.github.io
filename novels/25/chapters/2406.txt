Chapter 2409: Everything Will Be Better in the Future

Why did he suddenly go on the attack!!

Her face heated up, and she pushed him gently as she looked up and glared at him. “Can you be more serious?”

Mo Yesi smiled and backed off. “Alright, we’ll talk about this when we get back.”

“Brother-in-law, what were you whispering to Sister about?” Qiao Chen entered and saw his brother-in-law whispering into his sister’s ear.

Then, his sister blushed and glared at his brother-in-law.

Mo Yesi straightened up and smiled. “It’s not suitable for a child like you to listen to private conversations between husband and wife.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“Alright, let’s talk about it later.” Lu Rao walked over and patted Mo Yesi’s shoulder. “Your brother-in-law just finished his checkup. He’s in good health now, suitable for surgery.

“Should we get ready?”

Qiao Chen’s surgery would be performed by Mo Yesi and Lu Rao.

These two stood at the top of the medical world. It wasn’t easy to get one of them to perform surgery.

And this time, it meant that the two of them were the best.

Besides Qiao Chen, no one else had ever received such treatment.

Most importantly, Lu Rao was participating in this surgery out of friendship and didn’t accept a single cent.

“Mm, then get someone to prepare it.” Mo Yesi nodded. He was afraid that Qiao Chen, who was about to undergo surgery, would be too nervous, so he comforted him. “With me and Dr. Lu doing this surgery, it’ll definitely be successful.

“You don’t have to be too nervous. You’ll fall asleep after the anesthesia. You won’t feel anything. The surgery will be over by the time you wake up.

“Everything will get better in the future.”

“Mm.” Qiao Chen looked at him gratefully. “Thank you, Brother-in-law.”

With that, he also thanked Lu Rao. “Doctor Lu, thank you for helping in the surgery.”

Although Mo Yesi was Qiao Chen’s cousin, he was already used to calling him Brother-in-law, so he never thought of changing it.

“What’s there to thank me for? Your brother-in-law and I have been good friends for many years.” Lu Rao looked very loyal. “It’s rare for him to ask me for help, so I definitely have to help. Your brother-in-law is right, you don’t have to worry. This is a very simple surgery, and it’ll be done soon. Your brother-in-law is the most authoritative doctor in the cardiology department. You can rest assured with him performing the surgery.”

Qiao Chen changed his clothes and was pushed into the operating room.

Qiao Mianmian watched him enter. Although she knew that she had nothing to worry about, her heart still tightened when she saw the door to the operating room close.

Heart surgery wasn’t simple.

This surgery would determine whether Qiao Chen would be able to recover. It was very important to him.

It was also very important to her.

Mo Yesi also changed into his scrubs and prepared to enter the operating room.

When he reached the door, he turned to look at the nervous Qiao Mianmian and thought for a while before walking towards her.

“Baby, don’t worry.” He patted her head and said gently, “The operation will definitely be successful. Don’t worry, I promise you that I’ll make Chen Chen become a normal and healthy person. When this operation is over, he’ll be just like us.”
