Chapter 854: I Look Like Director Bai?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

She looked at Qiao Mianmian and said, “She looks so different from you. It’s as if she’s a different person.”

Qiao Mianmian touched her face. “I feel like a different person too. Director Bai, what do you think?”

Just as she finished speaking, she heard Bai Yusheng’s voice behind her. “Not bad, I think it’s pretty good too.”

Qiao Mianmian turned around.

Bai Yusheng stood behind her and sized her up. He then smiled and said, “The feeling of putting on makeup is the same as I imagined. How is it? Have you familiarized yourself with the script? Do you have confidence in the plot today?”

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t too sure.

But Bai Yusheng valued her so much, she definitely couldn’t answer him this way.

She thought for a while and said, “Mm, I’m confident. I’ll definitely do my best.”

Bai Yusheng nodded. “Don’t be too stressed, it’ll be better if you relax. Get ready, I’ll get someone to call you when the shoot starts.”

Bai Yusheng had other matters to attend to, so he left quickly.

Nana sighed. “Sister Mianmian, I think Director Bai treats you really well. He takes good care of you.”

“Really? How can you tell?”

“Don’t you realize that, although he doesn’t seem like a difficult person to talk to, most people are afraid of him? Moreover, he rarely interacts with other actors on set. But in front of you, he seems much more approachable.

“When he talks to you, his tone is especially gentle.

“Also...”

Nana looked up at Qiao Mianmian and said, “I think you and Director Bai look alike.”

Bai Yusheng was also extremely handsome.

He had the looks of a young hunk, but he was a capable one.

Nana hadn’t noticed it before.

Now that she realized this, she felt that their features were rather similar.

But she didn’t think too much about it. She thought that there were many similarities between good-looking people.

“I look like Director Bai?” Qiao Mianmian hadn’t realized this, and she couldn’t help but be stunned.

“That’s right. You and Director Bai both have very beautiful eyes, your noses are very similar, and your mouths are also like...” Nana paused for a while before continuing, “If someone says that you’re siblings, I definitely won’t doubt it. ”

Qiao Mianmian had a strange feeling because of what she said.

She was stunned for a few seconds before asking, “You think Director Bai and I look like siblings?”

“Yes.” Nana bit her lip and thought for a while before saying, “The way you communicate with each other feels like siblings. And I feel like Director Bai looks at you like you’re his sister.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Hence, the rumors about Bai Yusheng liking Qiao Mianmian were all nonsense.

Not to mention that Bai Yusheng was helping to take care of her, even if Qiao Mianmian didn’t have a boyfriend, Nana felt that he didn’t take care of her the way men liked women.

The love between a man and a woman was different from that between siblings.

It was easy to tell.

Qiao Mianmian kept quiet for a while, and that strange feeling emerged again.

But she didn’t know why.
