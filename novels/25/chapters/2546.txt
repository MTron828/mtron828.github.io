But it was inevitable.

Qiao Chen was silent for a full minute.

Then, she heard the young man say uncomfortably, “Sister, I know.”

“Alright.” Qiao Mianmian was actually a little uncomfortable. She quickly ended the topic. “You’re an adult now, I believe you know what to do. Then, I won’t be long-winded.”

Qiao Mianmian then hung up.

…

At the same time, in the Shen family.

“Eldest Miss, Madam, Old Master, Second Miss is back.” The butler walked into the hall, followed by a petite figure.

The atmosphere in the hall was heavy.

The butler glanced at Shen Rou, who was sitting beside Madam Shen with an awful expression. He then looked at Shen Xin behind him and couldn’t help but worry for her.

This time, First Miss was very angry.

Everyone in the Shen family knew that Second Miss had angered First Miss. After First Miss came back, she lost her temper and smashed a lot of things. The group of people below them didn’t dare to make a sound.

Old Master and Madam seemed angry too.

Second Miss might not be able to survive this.

Young Lady Shen was in charge now.

What Second Miss did had ruined Eldest Miss’s reputation. It was said that the company was also affected.

He wondered how First Miss would treat Second Miss later.

Although the butler was worried, they were still biological sisters.

No matter how angry First Miss was, she couldn’t really do anything to her sister.

At this thought, the butler looked at Shen Xin again and couldn’t help but slow down. He then lowered his voice and reminded her, “Second Miss, First Miss is very angry now. Madam and Old Master are also very angry. In a while… speak better and take the initiative to apologize. Don’t argue with them.”

The butler retreated.

Shen Xin walked towards Shen Rou.

She looked at the sullen Shen Rou and then at Madam Shen and Father Shen. After a few seconds of silence, she said softly, “Dad, Mom, Sister, I’m back.”

Shen Xin had just finished speaking when a shadow fell in front of her. Shen Rou got up and gave her a tight slap, causing her face to jerk to the side.

Her face swelled.

Shen Rou’s actions shocked everyone in the hall.

Father Shen and Madam Shen were shocked too. Madam Shen stood up with wide eyes. “Rourou, why did you hit your sister?”

Shen Rou’s eyes were cold and her expression was gloomy. She looked at Shen Xin without a trace of warmth. “Why can’t I hit her? She’s a traitor! She’s eating the Shen family’s food and using the Shen family’s clothes. Her current superior life was all given to her by the Shen family. But at the crucial moment, she wants to push our Shen family into the fire pit for an outsider.

“Shouldn’t we hit such a heartless ingrate?” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Madam Shen was stunned. She looked at Shen Xin’s swollen face and felt sorry for her.

Madam Shen had always loved her younger daughter.

Although she was angry at her actions this time, her heart ached when she saw her beloved younger daughter being hit.

“Rourou, Xiao Xin was just confused.” Madam Shen couldn’t bear it.. She walked to Shen Xin’s side and held her hand.
