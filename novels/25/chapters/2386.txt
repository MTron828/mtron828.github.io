Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“You mean…”

“Young Master Gong might really like that Qiao Mianmian. Previously, someone said that Young Master Gong and Mo Yesi broke up because of a woman, and then it was refuted that it was a rumor. I don’t think it’s a rumor.

“Otherwise, why would he be interested in this girl who looks like Qiao Mianmian?”

“Damn.”

“Damn.”

They suddenly realized that they learned a huge secret.

…

At a five-star hotel.

A black Rolls-Royce was parked on the street by the hotel entrance. The chauffeur got off first and then opened the backseat door.

When the person in the backseat came out, the chauffeur greeted him respectfully, “Young Master Chen.”

“Uncle Zhao, don’t wait for me. I’ll take a cab back myself.”

“Yes, Young Master Chen.”

Qiao Chen got out of the car, adjusted his scarf, and walked up the steps.

Just as he reached the hotel’s entrance, he heard a few surprised voices behind him.

“Qiao Chen, is that you?”

Qiao Chen stopped in his tracks and turned around.

The girls’ eyes lit up when they saw him, and they quickly walked towards him with smiles on their faces.

“Wow, Qiao Chen, it’s really you. I knew it. I recognized your back view right away.”

“Qiao Chen, is that Rolls-Royce yours? The one opening the door for you was your driver, right? So generous.”

Qiao Chen used to be their target in school.

He was even more different now.

Everyone in school knew that Qiao Chen was the Young Master of the Mo family. Now, he was recognized by them.

Previously, just his face alone was enough to make many girls fall for him. But now, with his status as the Young Master of the Mo family, it was as if he was covered in a golden halo. The girls were even more in love with him.

These girls were his classmates. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Seeing Qiao Chen in branded clothes, their hearts raced.

He used to be very handsome and was the crush of all the girls in school, but he was even more handsome now.

Qiao Chen smiled and greeted them, causing the girls to blush.

Just then, another voice came from behind. Soon, a boy in casual clothes walked up to Qiao Chen and patted him on the shoulder. “Young Master Mo, you’re here.”

“What Young Master?” Qiao Chen glared at him.

“I didn’t call you wrongly.” The boy looked ordinary and friendly. He smiled and said, “Everyone knows that you’re the Young Master of the Mo family. There’s nothing wrong with calling you Young Master Mo! Don’t you think so?”

“Alright, don’t joke with me.” Qiao Chen raised his hand in surrender. “I’m getting goosebumps. Consider it a good deed and spare me.”

“Hahaha.”

Everyone laughed.

The girls looked at him even more passionately.
