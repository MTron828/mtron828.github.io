Chapter 845: You’ll Be Cheated on by Her One Day!

She was so angry that her face turned pale. “Su Ze, who are you calling a crazy woman? You scumbag, you used to say that I had a good personality and that you liked it, and now you’re calling me crazy? Ha, are you trying to show off in front of Qiao Mianmian?

“I advise you not to waste your time. The man she’s with now is a hundred times, a thousand times better than you. Do you think she still likes you?”

“Shut up!” Su Ze growled.

He knew who Qiao Anxin was referring to.

That man...

No matter how unwilling he was, he had to admit that he couldn’t compare to Gong Zeli.

Just his status as the Young Master of the Gong family was enough to suppress him.

But he didn’t believe that Qiao Mianmian was really with Gong Zeli.

He’d known her for many years.

She wasn’t a materialistic woman.

There must be... some misunderstanding between her and Gong Zeli.

That’s right, there must be a misunderstanding.

“Why, are you anxious?” Qiao Anxin used to pretend in front of Su Ze because she wanted to marry into the Su family.

Now that she had a new goal and Su Ze insisted on breaking up with her, she knew that she couldn’t hold him back anymore and didn’t want to continue acting.

She glared at him. “You’re just an ordinary person. How can you compare to the Young Master of the Gong family? So what if you help her now? Will she even look at you?”

Even if Qiao Anxin never liked Su Ze.

But seeing how protective he was of Qiao Mianmian, she went crazy with jealousy.

She snatched this man from Qiao Mianmian. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

But now, he actually wanted to get back together with Qiao Mianmian and defend her. Wasn’t this a slap to her face?

Who knew how smug that slut was now.

“Qiao Anxin, I told you to shut up!” Su Ze’s face was red with anger, and the veins on his forehead were almost popping out.

Qiao Anxin looked at him and sneered. “Why, you don’t like it? But this is the truth. Su Ze, you think I lied to you and made you lose your true love, but do you think Qiao Mianmian is anything good? Even without me, you’ll be cheated by her one day!”

“I f*cking told you to shut up!” Su Ze roared and hit her in the face.

With a loud slap, Qiao Anxin’s face was thrown to the side.

Qiao Anxin’s mouth was bleeding.

Su Ze was still fuming. “I won’t allow you to insult Mianmian. If you say anything bad about her, I’ll hit you again!”

Qiao Anxin almost fainted from the slap.

It took her a while to recover.

Qiao Mianmian was a little tongue-tied.

She realized that she knew too little about Su Ze.

She never knew that he would hit women.

She felt that Su Ze was always a gentle and good-tempered man.

At least in the years they were together, he never lost his temper with her.

Not to mention touching her.

In front of her, he was always a gentle and nice man.

And this man actually knew how to hit women.

This was unimaginable to Qiao Mianmian.

Moreover, the slap he gave Qiao Anxin was very heavy.
