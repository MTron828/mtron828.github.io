Chapter 1444: Then, Why Would He Hold Your Hand?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Before she went, she treated him as her only hope.

But when he rejected her, he was so heartless.

Moreover, he wasn’t being spiteful. He really hadn’t helped her at all.

Even though she thought that he was still angry with her and refused to help, she understood everything after eavesdropping on his conversation with Yan Shaoqing.

Perhaps he already had feelings for Qiao Mianmian when he was involved in the scandal with her.

There was no smoke without fire.

She should have thought about it. How could those scandals be so simple?

“Rourou, don’t be so picky.” Madam Shen looked at Shen Rou’s pale face and tried to persuade her. “I’ve already asked around about your Aunt Cheng’s son. He’s an honest man and doesn’t have any ulterior motives. He doesn’t fool around outside.

“He’s not that good-looking, but his looks aren’t the only thing that matters when one gets married. The character is the most important. Mom thinks that Cheng An is really good. At least he’s honest and reliable. Moreover, he likes you so much. He’ll definitely treat you well when you get married.

“Your Aunt Cheng and Mom have known each other for many years. She won’t treat you badly.”

“You won’t be aggrieved if you marry into the Cheng family. Just listen to Mom and benefit from Cheng An.”

“What about Shen Xin?” Shen Rou suddenly sneered. “Mom, you just told me that Shen Xin is too young now and can’t help. In my opinion, she’s the most helpful person in the family now.”

Madam Shen was stunned. “How can Xiao Xin help?”

Shen Rou turned to look at Shen Xin and said, “Mom doesn’t know yet. The Young Master that the Mo family just acknowledged is in the same class as Xiao Xin, and they have a good relationship.

“I think that Young Master Mo still likes Xiao Xin. Maybe if Xiao Xin asks him for help, our Shen Corporation’s crisis will be resolved.

“How could a family like the Cheng family compare to the Mo family?

“Since the Mo family is willing to hold a banquet for this Young Master, it shows that they value him. I see that Old Madam likes him too. If he can speak up for our Shen family in front of Old Madam, this is more useful than anything.”

Shen Xin looked at Shen Rou in disbelief.

“What? Xiao Xin knows that Young Master Mo? Xiao Xin, is what your sister said true?” Madam Shen sounded shocked.

“Of course.” Shen Rou looked into Shen Xin’s eyes and narrowed her eyes. “I saw Xiao Xin eating alone with him previously. I’m sure they must have a good relationship. Now that the Shen family is in such huge trouble, as a member of the Shen family, shouldn’t she do her best for the Shen family?”

“Xiao Xin, do you think Sister is right?” Shen Rou asked.

Shen Xin clenched her fists. “Sister, I haven’t spoken to Qiao Chen in a long time. Our relationship isn’t good, it’s useless for me to look for him.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Is that so?” Shen Rou sneered. “Then, why did you go out tonight? I saw you leaving with Qiao Chen holding your hand. Where did you go? What did you do? You said that you don’t have a good relationship with him, so why did he hold your hand?

“Xiao Xin, the Shen family has treated you well. Now that the Shen family is in trouble, aren’t you going to help?”
