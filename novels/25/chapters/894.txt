“Also, I didn’t mean to not call you. It happened so suddenly, I didn’t think... I actually wanted to tell you later, but I thought you’d be worried if you found out, and I wasn’t hurt, so...”

“So, you don’t feel the need to tell me?” There was a hint of anger in the man’s low and magnetic voice.

“... Yes.”

“Then, even some people in your crew who have nothing to do with you know that you were almost splashed with sulfuric acid, but I, as your husband, don’t know about it? Do you think this is appropriate? You’re my wife, but I still have to find out about you from others. Don’t you find this ridiculous?”

“I’m sorry! I-I didn’t mean to...”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t expect this.

She simply didn’t want him to worry.

She didn’t expect him to be so angry and bothered by it because she didn’t call him immediately.

If she knew that this was what he was thinking, she wouldn’t have tolerated it.

She’d wanted to call him for a long time.

Even though this didn’t cause her any negative consequences, she was still afraid.

When she was afraid, he was the first person she thought of.

She wanted to seek his comfort immediately.

She wanted him to rush to her side, kiss her, hug her, and tell her not to be afraid.

But her rationality suppressed her urge to call him.

She knew that with just one word from her, he would rush to her side immediately.

But she knew that he wasn’t always free.

He’d be busy too.

He had a lot to settle.

She didn’t want to delay his work.

She didn’t want this to affect him.

Qiao Mianmian felt a little aggrieved. She was always thinking for his sake, but she still angered him.

The fear and aggrievedness of almost being splashed with sulfuric acid welled up in her heart. She felt a sting in her eyes and said, “I really didn’t do it on purpose. I just didn’t want you to worry too much.

“I’m sorry, I didn’t know you’d be so angry.”

The more Qiao Mianmian thought about it, the more aggrieved she felt.

She wanted to cry.

The man who was usually obedient, gentle, and doting to her and never said anything harsh to her was now so aggressive.

He was even blaming her.

He became so fierce.

She was a little afraid.

When Mo Yesi was gentle, he could pamper anyone.

But his temper was really scary.

“You’re crying?”

Qiao Mianmian sniffed and ignored him. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

She was already scared enough today.

When she received his call, she wanted to act coquettishly to him and get him to coax her.

In that case, she wouldn’t be so afraid anymore.

But he didn’t say a word of comfort.

He even blamed her for what she’d done...

Hmph, this pig trotter.

She didn’t want to talk to him anymore!

Mo Yesi kept quiet for a few seconds before saying, “Baby, don’t cry. I don’t mean to blame you. I’m just... too worried and afraid.”
