Chapter 1743: I’ll Skin Her Alive

In the lobby downstairs.

Shangguan Hua looked awful after being rejected. He asked the receptionist with a dark face, “You didn’t tell your Chairman Mo who I am?”

The receptionist knew his identity and was very polite. “Mr. Shangguan, Chairman Mo knows your identity.”

“And he still refuses to meet?”

“Yes, Chairman Mo said he won’t see anyone from Heng Yuan Corporation.”

Shangguan Hua’s face darkened.

“Chairman, why don’t... we go back first.” Xu Jie saw that he was so angry and carefully said, “Perhaps Chairman Mo’s anger hasn’t subsided. When we go back, you can ask Miss about this too. Only then can you find a solution.”

No matter how angry Shangguan Hua was, he had no choice but to go back.

If he stayed, it would only embarrass him further.

He didn’t expect Mo Yesi to be so disrespectful. He was already sincere enough to come personally, but he was still rejected.

Shangguan Hua’s expression darkened. “Back to the office.”

“Yes, Chairman.”

“Wait.”

“Chairman, do you have any other instructions?” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Get Qingqing back. I want to know what happened.”

...

Shangguan Qing was still having a tea party with a group of socialites when Xu Jie found her.

These socialites were all in the same circle, so they naturally heard about the marriage between the Shangguan and Gong families.

They naturally knew that Gong Zeli attacked Shangguan Qing because of a newbie in the entertainment industry.

Many of these socialites had designs on him.

They naturally didn’t have a good impression of this “love rival”.

But although they didn’t like Shangguan Qing, they were still polite to her and pretended to be close sisters.

After all, although Shangguan Qing was the youngest, she had the best family background among them.

“Qingqing, you don’t pay attention to entertainment news often, so you definitely don’t know that Qiao Mianmian likes to seduce men everywhere. Previously, there was a very popular young hunk called Tu Yilei who also spread rumors about her. For her, that young hunk even suffered a sulfuric acid splash.”

“That’s right. This news was sensational. To be able to get a man who relies on his looks to make a living to shield her from sulfuric acid, how good are her seducing skills?”

“Her relationship with Qin Han is also ambiguous. I heard from a friend that Qin Han took special care of her during the filming period. Very different from the way he treats other actresses. Although the two of them kept denying it, there’s no smoke without fire. I don’t believe there’s nothing between them.”

“I think she’s a loose woman. Any actor who has worked with her has been seduced by her.”

“Yes, I heard she’s good at flirting. Anyway, the men around her have all been in scandals with her. This kind of woman is too disgusting. She seduces men everywhere she goes. Perhaps she really is a vixen.”

“Young Master Gong is about to get engaged to Qingqing. Qingqing, aren’t you worried at all about letting such a vixen stay by Young Master Gong’s side?”

“If this vixen dares to seduce my man, I’ll skin her alive.”

Shangguan Qing was still angry, and her expression darkened when she heard these socialites’ words.

Everyone knew she was getting engaged to Gong Zeli.
