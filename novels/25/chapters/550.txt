Chapter 552: She Was His

“I’m an outsider? I’ve known Ah Si for over 20 years, we’ve been more than friends for the longest time. I was concerned about my friend. I was worried because he was getting married all of a sudden, to a woman that came from nowhere. I investigated you because I didn’t want him to be cheated on.

“Was I wrong to do this?

“Weren’t you eyeing Ah Si’s status and the position of Young Madam Mo? Isn’t that why you married him?! Qiao Mianmian, what are you feigning? You can fool Ah Si, but you can’t fool me.”

At this moment, Shen Rou crumbled completely.

Her facade was gone.

When she realized that Mo Yesi had really fallen for Qiao Mianmian and that she no longer had a chance, she lost it completely.

“You don’t love Ah Si at all.” Shen Rou screamed hysterically. “You don’t deserve to be treated so well by Ah Si. Qiao Mianmian, who are you to deserve all of this? On what basis do you deserve Ah Si’s love and treatment?”

“On the basis that she’s my wife, the woman I love.”

Before Qiao Mianmian thought of a response, Mo Yesi had put his arm around her shoulders, as if making a statement.

She was his.

Seeing how irrational and hysterical Shen Rou looked, Mo Yesi furrowed his brows. He gave in a little and said calmly, “Shen Rou, this is the last time I’m saying this to you.

“I wasn’t slipshod about my marriage, and Mianmian didn’t come from nowhere. She’s the woman I’ve decided to spend the rest of my life with. Besides her, I won’t consider anyone else for the position of Young Madam Mo.

“This is my last warning to you. My relationship with Mianmian doesn’t call for anyone else’s intervention, including yours. In the future, if you do anything like this in the name of my interests, I won’t be so kind.

“Even as a good friend, there are boundaries you cannot cross. This time, I’ll let it go on account of our friendship. But if there’s a next time, I will deal with it as I deem fit.

“Also, Mianmian is my wife, the woman I care for. Anyone mean or rude to her is doing so to me. Anyone who offends her is offending me too. You know very well what ought to be said, and what ought not to be.

“Don’t force me to break our relationship of so many years.”

Shen Rou opened her mouth and a tear rolled in between her lips.

She tasted the saltiness of her teardrop.

And her heart ached even more.

He was warning her.

He was being so cruel and heartless to her in front of somebody else. He was trampling all over her pride and dignity.

Without saving her a single ounce of face.

These 20 years of friendship and companionship meant nothing to him.

In his eyes, there only existed a single Qiao Mianmian.

Even though the woman knew him for only one-thousandth of the time she did.

Even though the woman was only with him for the benefits. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Even though the woman wasn’t the least bit true to him, unlike her...

He was willing to stab her in the heart time and time again for the sake of that woman.

He really... didn’t care about her at all.
