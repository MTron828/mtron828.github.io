Chapter 580: He’d Only Just Left Her for a Few Days, and He Had a New Target Now?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“You won’t be able to handle all of it on your own. Moreover, I took so many pains to get you under my wing, I can’t possibly mistreat you.”

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t too insistent.

After declining for a bit, she eventually agreed. “Alright. Then, thank you, Sister Xie.”

There was no harm in finding an assistant.

And of course, deep down, she wanted an assistant too.

“Bai Yusheng’s shows have always been good. Your first-ever show is directed by him, and you got the third female role. That’s a good start.” Linda analyzed for her. “Get some popularity out of this first, you’ll have a much better time ahead in this industry.

“He’s very good at grooming newbies. A lot of new artistes made it big after being in a show directed by him. So, do your best!”

Linda wasn’t shocked that Qiao Mianmian got the third female role.

She’d long known that Qiao Mianmian was capable and talented.

If it wasn’t for Qiao Anxin’s deliberate moves against her, Qiao Mianmian would be popular by now.

Granted, she wouldn’t be a top artiste yet, but being in the third tier wouldn’t be a problem at all.

“I know. Don’t worry, Sister Xie. I’ll do my best.”

...

They left the cafeteria.

Qiao Mianmian was wondering whether to go home and read her script or to head to the Mo Corporation to look for Mo Yesi. Before she decided, she saw a familiar car—one she did not quite want to see.

Right next to the cafeteria was a high-class Western cuisine restaurant.

A man and a woman walked out through the turnstile doors.

The man was in a white shirt and white pants and looked rather handsome. His slender figure attracted the glances of many women around.

Including the beautiful woman beside him, decked in branded clothes and goods.

The two of them were laughing and talking happily.

When making their way down the steps, the woman almost slipped in her stilettos on the uneven ground, looking like she was about to fall.

Fortunately, the man saved the damsel in distress and held her in a swift motion.

He then naturally and quickly wrapped her in his arms.

The woman was pressed against his chest and blushed immediately. She looked up at his face.

That sweet expression said enough about how she felt about it.

Qiao Mianmian felt a strange discomfort witnessing that.

Although she already knew that Su Ze wasn’t a good man...

The fact was that he was still with Qiao Anxin, right?

And Qiao Anxin was pregnant with his child.

What was he doing out here, going on a date with a woman in broad daylight?

As much as he was a scumbag, wasn’t this too much?

He’d only just left her for a few days, and he had a new target now?

Qiao Mianmian felt like this man was surprising her with how low he could get time and again. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Just as she thought he was utterly shameless, he did something even more disgusting.

The woman hadn’t moved since she lost her balance and ended up against Su Ze’s chest.

Of course, Su Ze didn’t push her away too.

Both of them locked eyes for a while until Su Ze suddenly turned around as if he sensed something.

Qiao Mianmian was about to look away, but it was too late.

At that moment, they made eye contact.

Su Ze was evidently shocked to see her, given how widely he opened his eyes.

Qiao Mianmian hadn’t expected to be seen by him.

The most amusing thing was that she saw a trace of panic in his eyes.

It was as if she’d caught him doing something wrong.

But the fact was that they had long broken up and had nothing to do with each other anymore.
