Chapter 2948: What Truth Do You Want to Know?

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

Mo Yunchen looked at Tang Ya in disbelief.

“Y-You’re..” He couldn’t believe it. “You’re my daughter?

“Could it be that… Wangiu moved away because she was pregnant? Could it be that she was alone ever since she left me?

“You said death… did Wanqiu..” Mo Yunchen didn’t dare to continue.

He was too shocked.

How was that possible?

‘Tang Wanqiu actually gave birth to a daughter for him, but he didn’t know anything.

He’d gone to look for her, but she’d moved away and said she never wanted to see him again.

He thought that she must have hated him so much that she didn’t want to see him anymore.

Hence, he hadn’t looked for her since then. He thought that since she hated him so much, her life would only return to normal if he completely left her life.

She was going to get married and have children in the future. She was such a good woman, she would definitely find a husband who doted on her and give birth to a very cute child. She would lead an enviable life.

He had always thought that Tang Wangiu had already married someone and was leading a good life.

He always thought that she was doing well.

But if Tang Ya was his daughter, he had never fulfilled his duty as a father.

Mo Yunchen’s heart was in turmoil. His hand trembled uncontrollably as he reached out and walked towards Tang Ya.

“Xiao Ya, are you really my daughter?” Mo Yunchen’s eyes were a little red. “No wonder she kept vomiting and had a bad appetite. She couldn’t eat anything. I thought she was sick. I took her to the hospital for a checkup, but the doctor didn’t tell me she was pregnant.

“She said that she’d be fine after taking some medicine.

“Was she already pregnant at that time? But why did she hide it from me..’

“Stop.” Tang Ya looked at him and said sternly, “Just stand there. Don’t take another step forward.”

Mo Yunchen saw that she was agitated and immediately stopped in his tracks. He made a comforting gesture. “Alright, alright. I stopped. I’ll stand here. Xiao Ya, don’t be agitated. I won’t do anything to you. I just want to know the truth.”

“The truth?” Tang Ya sneered. “What truth do you want to know? Why didn’t she tell you about her pregnancy? Why did she move from her parent’s place she’d lived at for over 20 years to a strange city?

“Or why she didn’t marry for the rest of her life?”

Mo Yunchen’s eyes were full of guilt.

The person he let down the most in his life was Tang Wanqiu.

What he owed her could never be repaid.

“Even if she told you that she was pregnant, would you have taken responsibility? Would you have married her and given her a family?” Tang Ya looked at the silent Mo Yunchen and sneered. “You wouldn’t. If she told you at that time, you might have thought that she was a scheming woman and that she

wanted to keep you with her child.

“And she was a single and unmarried woman. If she hadn’t moved away back then, do you know how much gossip and ridicule she would have been subjected to if others found out that she had a child in that small place?”

“Xiao Ya, I’ve let both of you down.”
