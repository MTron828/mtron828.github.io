Chapter 2999 Tell Her About That Night

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

“What story do you want to hear?”

“I love every story you tell me.”

“Then, I’ll tell you a story about me.” Mo Yesi thought for a while and said in a low voice, “Mianmian, do you remember when and under what circumstances we first met?”

He kept wondering if he should tell her about that night.

He could keep quiet for the rest of his life.

As long as he didn’t tell her, she would never know that the man that night was him.

But if he didn’t say anything, this matter would always linger in his heart.

“Of course, I remember.” Qiao Mianmian smiled and rubbed her head against his chest. “It was in your company. Back then, I had no choice but to agree to marry you in

order to let you operate on Chen Chen.”

“Mm, you had no choice?” The man’s voice deepened, sounding a little dangerous.

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t afraid of him.

He was just a paper tiger in front of her!

“I had no choice.” The woman’s voice was soft and coquettish. “I just met you for the first time, and you wanted me to marry you. Don’t you find it scary? Moreover, I never

thought of getting married so early.”

She married before she even graduated from university.

And she married a stranger.

No matter how handsome, rich, and amazing this man was, any normal person would think that it was absurd for him to make such a request to a woman he’d just met for

the first time.

Who knew if he had other motives?

What if he wanted to use marriage as a cover?

If he hadn’t needed to operate on Qiao Chen, she would never agree to it.

“So, did you hate me when I forced you to marry me?”

At first, he could feel that she was very distant from him. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

He used Qiao Chen’s matter to force her to get married to him. It was normal for her to hate him.

“No.” Unexpectedly, the woman denied it. “I never hated you.”

He’d been good to her from the start. She wasn’t a cold-blooded person, how could she hate him?

“Never hated me?” Mo Yesi raised an eyebrow in surprise. “Then, why were you so against me?”

“That was not rejection.” Qiao Mianmian bit her lip and thought for a while before saying, “I just felt that our marriage definitely wouldn’t last long and that you and I would

definitely get a divorce soon. So, I thought it was better for us to keep a distance.”

“Oh? Because we’d break up sooner or later?” Very good, he didn’t know that she’d been thinking of divorcing him.

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian nodded.

They would break up sooner or later, so there was no need to invest too many feelings.

She wouldn’t be sad when they parted.

“Why are you suddenly asking about this?” The topic changed from the original question. “You just asked me if I remembered when we first met, right?”

Mo Yesi kept quiet.

“Mianmian, that day wasn’t actually the first time we met. The first time we met…” The man paused for a few seconds and looked at her deeply. “Our first meeting was

actually in a hotel.”

Qiao Mianmian frowned. “Our first meeting was in a hotel?”.
