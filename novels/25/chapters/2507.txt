Chapter 2508: After All, He Couldn’t Show Evidence

[I couldn’t forgive her lies, so I chose to treat her as a stranger in the future.]

[As for why I had to come forward and clarify this matter, it was because I didn’t want my true savior to bear any infamy.]

[Qiao Mianmian saved my life. Whoever attacks her is attacking me. I, Gong Zeli, will do anything to make this person pay.]

[Try it if you don’t believe me.]

Gong Zeli’s statement was like a bomb that blew up the netizens who had just finished eating.

They thought that Gong Zeli’s team would definitely deny it.

Or that he’d come out to refute the rumors.

But no one expected him to deny it. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Gong Zeli almost drowned when he was 13?

Shen Rou pretended to be the person who saved him and lied to him for 10 years?

And the person who saved Gong Zeli that night was Qiao Mianmian?!

This wave after wave of surprise was extremely exciting.

Today was especially exciting.

Hence, there was no ambiguity between Gong Zeli and Qiao Mianmian.

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t the scheming girl that was depicted. She was deliberately alienated by Shen Rou and the others.

Gong Zeli and Shen Rou cut ties because Shen Rou lied to him. It had nothing to do with Qiao Mianmian.

He treated Qiao Mianmian well only because he was grateful that she was his savior.

That made sense.

But soon, another netizen asked another question: “If Gong Zeli and Qiao Mianmian aren’t in an ambiguous relationship, why did he and Mo Yesi break up? No one refuted this.”

Someone even raised a question: “No one can verify what happened more than 10 years ago. Is Gong Zeli making it up?”

Hence, half of the people believed Gong Zeli’s statement.

Half of them didn’t believe it.

After all, he had no evidence.

Hence, it was possible that he was making it up.

Those who believed in Gong Zeli naturally scolded Shen Rou.

“Damn, Shen Rou is too disgusting. She even said that Qiao Mianmian is scheming. Why do I feel like she’s the scheming one? She actually took the credit of others and lied to Gong Zeli for 10 years. How is she so shameless? This behavior is disgusting.”

“No wonder Gong Zeli cut ties with her. If it was me, I’d definitely cut ties too. No, not only would I cut ties with her, but I would also slap her. Actually, I’ve experienced similar things before, just not that serious. But I’m also disgusted like I swallowed a fly. It’s really heartbreaking to be treated like a fool by someone you trust.”

“I understand Gong Zeli and support his decision. If what he said is true, then Shen Rou is really too much.”

“Why do you think Shen Rou is the kind and beautiful type? She looks like a smart and powerful woman. To be honest, I’m not surprised that she would do such a thing.”

“I think the same way. Shen Rou doesn’t look gentle, and she looks a little domineering. Moreover, most career women don’t have simple thoughts.”

“I don’t think Gong Zeli would lie. He’s a very proud person. He wouldn’t bother to fabricate such things.”
