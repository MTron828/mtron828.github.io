Chapter 806: Would Your Hubby Have Any objections?

“Yes.”

Wei Zheng could feel Mo Yesi’s anger and didn’t dare to delay. He immediately turned to Shen Rou and said, “Miss Shen, please.”

Shen Rou wiped her tears and looked up at Mo Yesi with a smile. “Alright, I’ll leave. I’ll leave right away. I know that you only have Qiao Mianmian in your heart now. I’ll only be an eyesore to you if I stay here. Ah Si, although you’ve given up on me, your place in my heart will never change.

“I believe that time will prove everything. You’ll know who’s the one who’s true to you.”

She then turned around and left the office.

Wei Zheng stood rooted to the ground for two seconds before following her.

Not long after they left.

The secretaries outside heard the sound of something falling on the floor.

They looked at each other in fear.

What did Miss Shen and Chairman Mo talk about in the office? Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Why were Miss Shen’s eyes swollen when she walked out? She was obviously crying.

Did she know that Chairman Mo had a girlfriend?

So she was sad?

...

When Qiao Mianmian arrived at the hot pot restaurant, she saw Jiang Luoli sitting alone at a table. She was eating a piece of tripes and holding a bottle of beer.

She was boiling her tripes as she drank.

It seemed like she was enjoying her meal alone.

Qiao Mianmian stood at the door for a few seconds and then quickly walked towards her.

“Baby, you’re here so soon? Boss, get me another bowl and chopsticks.” Jiang Luoli was so happy to see Qiao Mianmian that her eyes narrowed.

She reached out and patted the seat beside her. “Baby, come sit here, let’s sit next to each other. Sigh, you’ve only been gone for a few days, why do I miss you so much? It feels like it’s been a few years.”

There was a long stool in the store.

Qiao Mianmian walked over and sat on a stool with her.

Jiang Luoli put down her chopsticks and hugged her tightly.

“Baby, do you know that I really missed you and wanted to see you today, but you actually returned to Yuncheng City? Hahaha, can you hear what I’m thinking?”

Qiao Mianmian hugged her too and smiled. “Then, we must be telepathic. I really wanted to see you today, so I came back. Moreover, how could I miss out on hot pot?”

Jiang Luoli didn’t say anything else and just hugged her tightly. After a few seconds, she slowly let go.

The boss brought an empty bowl over.

Qiao Mianmian prepared the ingredients according to her usual preferences. Jiang Luoli placed the freshly-burned tripes in her bowl and smiled. “You came to look for me right after you arrived in Yuncheng City. Would your husband have any objections?

“Although I do want to see you, I’ll feel guilty if this makes you unhappy.”

This store’s tripes were the best.

Qiao Mianmian always ordered two servings each time she came.

Jiang Luoli knew that this was her favorite, so she scooped it into her bowl.

The tripes were just right, and Qiao Mianmian ate it in one bite.

After she was done eating, she picked up a slice and placed it in the pot. Seeing that Jiang Luoli picked up the beer bottle again, she frowned and stopped her. “Luo Luo, didn’t you say you drank too much last night? Why are you drinking again now?”
