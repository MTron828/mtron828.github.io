Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

But her strong and sincere image made people believe her words.

It didn’t look like she was lying at all.

Moreover, Shen Xin’s looks were more likable.

She wasn’t as aggressive as Shen Rou.

Hence, Shen Rou had to act pitiful to gain sympathy.

But Shen Xin didn’t need to.

Some netizens were already suspicious of Shen Rou’s post.

They thought she was lying.

When Shen Xin posted this, they naturally trusted their judgment even more.

A few of the more rational verified accounts saw Shen Xin’s post and reposted it.

The caption: The truth is here.

They hadn’t taken sides.

This repost was on Shen Xin’s side.

Someone in the comment section asked: “Brother T, so you think Shen Rou is lying too? Hiding it from her sister?”

“Brother T, are you on Shen Rou’s side now?”

Brother T replied to a fan: “I think her sister’s words are more believable than Shen Rou’s. I believe in my intuition.”

The fans continued: “They were the ones who posted the two videos. No one has any evidence to prove that the other person is lying. Brother T, aren’t you afraid of being slapped in the face by taking sides so early?”

Brother T: “Who said there’s no evidence? Didn’t Huan Yu post evidence previously? I think the evidence is conclusive. Actually, a lot of Shen Rou’s words in the video were flawed and couldn’t withstand scrutiny. However, many people softened up when a beauty pretended to be pitiful. Even if they had doubts, they wouldn’t bear to make things difficult for her.”

Fans: “Brother T, do you dare to make a bet with us fans?”

Brother T: “What bet?”

Fans: “If Shen Rou is lying, then you win. If her sister is lying, then we win. Brother T, if you lose, you give us benefits. If we lose, you broadcast the treasure map.”

Brother T: “Then, prepare the treasure map.”

After the few verified accounts reposted and expressed their stances, the netizens felt that Shen Xin’s words were even more credible.

After all, those verified accounts didn’t take sides easily.

Those who could make them side with them were definitely not liars.

Something similar happened before.

Many netizens were slapped in the face. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Moreover, these verified accounts rarely paid attention to such gossip. It was rare for them to pay attention to it, so they naturally attracted attention.

Netizen A: “Even Brother T and the rest think that what Shen Rou’s sister said is true, then Shen Rou must be lying. I don’t believe anyone else, but I believe Brother T and Little Bear. They’re very good at judging people.”

Netizen B: “Brother T’s eyes are sharp. He won’t misjudge anyone. I felt that Shen Rou’s words were full of flaws and didn’t have any credibility at all. Some people even fought with me. Shen Rou doesn’t look good. Her sister looks much more honest. She actually treated her biological sister like this. She’s crazy.”

Netizen C: “I stand on her sister’s side too. It’s not based on what everyone’s saying. This time, I believe in my intuition.”

Those verified accounts had tens of millions of fans.

In terms of popularity, they weren’t inferior to many popular artistes.
