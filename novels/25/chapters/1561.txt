Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“I’ll return the favor. Just you wait.”

Linda sneered. “Alright, I’ll wait. I’ll be there anytime.”

Now, Linda wasn’t afraid of Qiao Anxin.

So what if Qiao Anxin relied on Boss Huang?

Her artiste’s boyfriend was the Chairman of the Mo Corporation.

Boss Huang was nothing in front of Chairman Mo.

He wasn’t even qualified to tie Chairman Mo’s shoelaces.

Qiao Anxin was dragged away by Song Fang.

Linda spat in the direction she left. “Who do you think you are? You even dared to bite a perverted old man like Boss Huang just to be popular. You’re really heartless.

“Just wait and see. You’ll regret it sooner or later.

“You deserve the retribution you will get on that day!”

Qiao Mianmian looked in the direction Qiao Anxin left. “Is that Boss Huang very perverted?”

“Exactly.” Linda gloated. “Everyone in the industry knows that Boss Huang is famous for being a pervert. Some female artistes were even played with by him. Qiao Anxin is really willing to go all out to seduce such a person.

“Actually, thinking about it, she’s pretty pitiful now. She must know what kind of person Boss Huang is, but for her future, she has no choice but to risk it. There’s gain and loss, right? Everything was her choice.”

Qiao Mianmian was silent for a few seconds before nodding. “You’re right, no one forced her. Since it’s her choice, there’s nothing to pity. Alright, let’s go.”

“Mm.”

Qiao Mianmian and Linda had just reached the elevator lobby when Qiao Mianmian received a call from Qin Han.

On the phone, Qin Han asked where she was and said that he was already at the hotel.

Qiao Mianmian told him that they had arrived at the hotel, and Qin Han told her to wait. He said he would arrange for someone to pick her up.

...

A few minutes later.

Qin Han arranged for someone to take Qiao Mianmian upstairs.

The audition was on the 28th floor. Qiao Mianmian only realized that there were more people than she imagined when she got out of the elevator.

Moreover, there were many A- and B-list celebrities.

Most of them were A-list, B-list, and C-list celebrities.

It wasn’t that the C-list celebrities weren’t willing to come for the audition. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

It was because such a huge production wasn’t their place to be at yet.

It was obvious how competitive they were.

Qiao Mianmian looked at the artistes preparing for the audition and then down at herself.

She suddenly realized that she was the least famous person on the audition today.

She wasn’t even considered a C-lister.

No matter what, Qiao Anxin was still considered an A-lister.

Qiao Mianmian felt pressured.

Before coming, she felt that her chances were slim.

After coming, she felt that she had no hope.

She felt that her only advantage was her acting skills.

But among the artistes who came for the audition today, many capable actresses won the Best Actress Award, and not just one or two.

There were three with Best Actress awards.

Qiao Mianmian knew all these actresses. Whether it was their looks, skills, or fame, they were all very impressive.

Linda couldn’t help but sigh when she saw so many first- and second-tier actors. “The competition today is pretty intense. Mianmian, don’t be too stressed. Just do your best. It’s fine if you can’t get the role this time. Just treat it as seeing the world.”
