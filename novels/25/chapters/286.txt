Chapter 289: So Much That She Was Unhappy About

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

She didn’t like Qiao Mianmian and surely did not want her to be “filial” to her.

Just the thought of her son being nicer to someone else than he was to herself irked her.

There was so much about this daughter-in-law that she was unhappy about.

And what Mo Yesi just did only reinforced her bias against Qiao Mianmian.

Her son was completely under that woman’s spell.

He was now on her side for everything.

She’d only made her wait for a while longer, and he was already feeling bad for her?

Madam Mo looked at the bowl of soup before her and resisted the temptation to hurl it on the ground. She found an excuse and said, “I haven’t been feeling so good lately, I don’t think I should have this.”

Mo Yesi eyed her deeply.

Old Madam took her word for it and asked in concern, “Why, did you catch a cold? Have you got the doctor to check on you?”

Madam Mo smiled kindly to Old Madam and said politely, “I did catch a cold, but it’s not serious. I’ll be fine with some medicine. Thank you for your concern, Mom.”

Old Madam then went on telling her to take good care of her health.

As her son, Mo Yesi should’ve offered a few words of concern too, but he did not say a thing. Instead, the look in his eyes deepened when he heard her say she’d caught a cold.

His expression changed slightly too.

The meal was considerably an enjoyable one.

“Considerably” so, because Madam Mo hadn’t said much throughout the meal.

She’d only respond when Old Madam directed questions to her.

It was completely different from her usual talkative self. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Old Madam didn’t notice anything different initially.

But after the meal, she started to find it a little odd.

After the meal, she eyed Madam Mo too and thought about it for a while. She guessed a possibility.

Mo Yesi hadn’t intended to stay over at the Mo residence for the night. He was ready to leave with Qiao Mianmian after they had their dinner.

The longing in Madam Mo’s eyes was evident when she heard that he was about to leave. “Ah Si, you haven’t been back in so long, don’t you want to stay for a few more days? You and your brother are the same, you always leave after spending only half a day at home. He comes back only once a month and now you’re the same. We don’t have many people at home. Without both of you around, your grandma and I can’t even find someone to talk to sometimes.”

Old Madam looked reluctant to let them go too, but she did not ask for them to stay.

Her grandson had grown up. He had his own life now.

How could he be by their side all the time?

Old Madam had been prepared for this a long time back.

Moreover, her precious grandson had a family of his own now. He’d definitely like to have time with his newly wedded wife. She understood that very well.

“Ah Si, Mianmian, Grandma knows you have your own matters to busy yourself with, so I won’t keep you any longer. Just come home whenever you’re free. Although you’re still young and strong, you still have to take good care of your health. Especially Ah Si, Grandma knows you’re busy with the Mo Firm after taking it over recently. But in any case, you’ve got to take good care of yourself, don’t tire yourself out too much.

“You’re a man with a family now. Even if you’re not thinking for yourself, you’ve to think for your wife.”

Mo Yesi nodded. “Grandma, I’ll take note.”

He knew this very well even without Old Madam’s reminders.

Back then, he didn’t have much to take care of and hence spent all his time and energy on his work.
