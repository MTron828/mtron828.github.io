Chapter 758: What Do You Think About Mianmian’s Work?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Mo Yesi couldn’t help but sneer. “She listens to everything you say and doesn’t have her own opinions. Do you take her seriously? If she wants such a puppet as her son, then I really am not the son she wants.”

“Ah Si, your mom said... you argued with her because of Mianmian’s work? She hopes that Mianmian can leave the entertainment industry and stay at home to take care of her husband and children and be a good wife to you. But you don’t approve of her.”

Old Madam paused for a few seconds before asking again, “What exactly do you think about Mianmian’s work?”

Mo Yesi frowned and kept quiet.

Old Madam must have called because of this.

When he brought Qiao Mianmian back, he hadn’t told Old Madam about her work.

But he believed that Old Madam would definitely get someone to investigate.

Old Madam hadn’t asked about this before, which meant that she didn’t mind.

Or rather, even if she minded it, she was still willing to respect Qiao Mianmian and didn’t intend to interfere with her work.

But now, he suddenly asked...

Old Madam must have changed her mind.

And the sudden change was most likely related to Qiao Mianmian’s recent scandals. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Old Madam was a very traditional woman.

She could accept her granddaughter-in-law acting, but she couldn’t accept her having scandals with other men.

A powerful family like the Mo family valued their reputation more than anything else.

If it affected the family’s reputation, Old Madam wouldn’t sit back and do nothing.

Mo Yesi frowned even more.

Old Madam was an elder whom he respected deeply.

He could be domineering towards Madam Mo, but towards Old Madam...

As he was deep in thought, she heard Old Madam’s voice again. “What exactly is going on between her and that male actor? Ah Si, I’m not a senior who likes to interfere with the younger generation. Both of you are no longer children and have your own opinions. I’m sure you know what to do and what not to do. So, as long as you don’t do anything out of line, as long as it doesn’t affect the Mo family’s reputation, I can’t be bothered to interfere.

“Your brother and you have really made the Mo family proud, there’s no need for me to worry about you. I didn’t want to bother about your wife anyway, so I let her be. Although the entertainment industry is huge, with the Mo family’s protection, no one would dare to do anything to her. I’m not worried about the entertainment industry turning chaotic; she can act if she wants to. But what’s with all these scandals?

“She’s always been involved in scandals with men.

“I believe that girl didn’t do anything out of line, but it’s not good to have too many scandals, right?”

Old Madam didn’t seem to be reprimanding him. She seemed to be trying to reason with him.

She really didn’t mean to blame Qiao Mianmian.

Mo Yesi could tell that too, so he calmly listened to Old Madam and said, “Grandma, when I get back, I’ll explain everything to you.

“I’m not a fool. I know what I’m doing.”

“Alright.” Old Madam was a reasonable person and did not probe further. “We’ll talk about it when you’re back. Is your mom’s cell phone number still on your blacklist? If you don’t let her out, she’ll come crying to me again.”
