Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian packed up quickly and went downstairs to have breakfast with Nana. Then, she took the other crew members’ car to the filming location.

Top-tier artistes like Tu Yilei had their own cars.

She didn’t have to share a car with them.

Second- and third-tier artistes all had their own cars.

Only a newbie like Qiao Mianmian would be in the same car as the crew.

Most of the crew members were men.

Seeing such a beautiful girl sitting in the car, they couldn’t help but take a few more glances. Some of the younger guys even blushed. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

They’d naturally seen many handsome men and beautiful women in their line of work.

But it was rare to see such a pretty girl.

And it was obvious that this little girl was completely natural. She had never gone under the knife.

Anyone who did some surgery would always appear a little unnatural.

For example, the female lead, Huang Yilin.

Huang Yilin was beautiful, but because of the plastic surgery she did, she looked a little unnatural in real life.

In terms of looks, this girl was definitely prettier than Huang Yilin.

However, the casting wasn’t based on looks. Face played a part, but the most important factor was acting.

Huang Yilin’s expression was a little stiff, but her acting wasn’t bad, and she was rather popular.

An hour later, they arrived at the filming location.

The filming location was on a beach. Qiao Mianmian had just gotten off the car when she saw a huge van stop in front of them. A person holding an umbrella got off first, followed by a person holding a glass of water and a bag.

“Sister Mianmian, that’s Huang Yilin.”

Nana looked at the last woman out of the car, and her eyes lit up. She lowered her voice and said, “Huang Yilin is the most popular actress now. She’s so young, but she’s already won the Best Actress Award. She’s considered very outstanding among the other artistes in the same batch.

“She’s pretty, but why do I feel like her face isn’t as natural as before?”

“Keep it down.”

Qiao Mianmian was also looking at Huang Yilin. “Don’t let them hear you.”

Huang Yilin wasn’t as pretty as she looked in the picture.

But she was pretty.

She was a beauty. She was tall, had fair skin, and wore a tight red dress.

She was probably afraid of being exposed to the sun, so she was wearing a silver sunscreen.

She was also wearing a huge sunshade cap.

An assistant held an umbrella over her head, blocking the glaring sunlight.

The other assistant opened a water bottle and handed it to her. “Sister Yilin, have some water.”

Huang Yilin received it and took a sip.

She didn’t know if it was because she didn’t sleep well, but she seemed to be in low spirits.

Suddenly, her eyes lit up, and she looked in a certain direction excitedly.

Qiao Mianmian and Nana followed her line of sight and saw another man alighting from a black Maybach. They immediately understood why Huang Yilin was so agitated.

It was Bai Yusheng.

A shaved Bai Yusheng.
