Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

‘Mo Shixiu heaved a sigh of relief when he heard that his daughter was safe.

After a few seconds of silence, he turned to look at Mo Yunchen and said, “From what Tang Ya said, she didn’t give Dad any poison.

“But just to be safe, I think we should go to the hospital for a checkup.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

‘Mo Yesi nodded in agreement. “I think so, too. From what she said just now, Dad didn’t take any poison. Big Brother, go back and accompany Sister-in-law first. You have to comfort her.

“Tl accompany Dad to the hospital for a check-up.”

“Alright, then.”

The results showed that the drug Tang Ya gave Mo Yunchen wasn’t poison.

It was a common cold medicine.

“Uncle Mo’s health is very good, there’s no problem. You don’t have to worry.” Lu Rao patted Mo Yesi’s shoulder. “But he seems to be in low spirits as if he suffered a huge blow. He needs to rest well when he gets back.”

Mo Yesi walked out of Lu Rao’s office and saw Mo Yunchen standing in the corridor in a daze. No one knew what he was thinking. Mo Yesi had already walked to his side, but he remained unmoving. He looked in a certain direction and didn’t speak.

“Dad, the results are out. Your body is fine. The medicine you took is just a cold medicine.” Mo Yesi told him the results.

Mo Yunchen turned around slowly. “Cold medicine?”

“Mm.

Mo Yunchen fell silent again.

“Yesi, Xiao Ya didn’t hurt Yueyue, nor did she hurt me. She just wanted to stand up for her mother and wanted to see my attitude. I already owe Wangiu too much, I don’t want to owe her anymore.

“Xiao Ya is my daughter, but I never knew of her existence. I didn’t fulfill my duty as a father. I really let Wangiu down back then. Wanqiu has already left this world, I don’t have a chance to make it up to her.

“So, no matter what, I have to protect Xiao Ya.”

Mo Yunchen looked up at Mo Yesi. “I can’t let Xiao Ya go to jail.”

“Tang Ya didn’t hurt Yueyue and you, but it’s a fact that she kidnapped Yueyue.” Mo Yesi could tell that Mo Yunchen wanted them to stop pursuing Tang Ya. He said in a business-like tone, “Even if she didn’t hurt Yueyue this time, what about next time?

“Moreover, even if I don’t pursue this matter, Big Brother and Sister-in-law definitely won’t let her off easily. Grandma suffered a huge blow because of this matter and hasn’t woken up until now. Sister-in-law almost fainted from crying a few times. Even if she didn’t hurt Yueyue, everyone else was hurt

because of this. I don’t think they will agree to let her off just like that.

“This isn’t fair to Big Brother and Sister-in-law.”

‘Mo Yunchen’s expression changed slightly.

He seemed like he wanted to say something, but in the end, he kept quiet.

What could he say?

He felt guilty towards Tang Wangiu and Tang Ya. He wanted to make it up to her and protect her.

But Mo Yesi’s words made him understand that he couldn’t protect Tang Ya.

This wasn’t his problem alone.

He could let it go, but he couldn’t ask others to let it go..
