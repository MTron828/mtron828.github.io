Chapter 2082: There’s a Price to Pay For Everything

She seemed to have really married a capable husband.

Was there anything Mo Yesi couldn’t do?

Qiao Mianmian studied the things on Mo Yesi’s desk for a while. Just as she picked up her cell phone to check the time, the screen suddenly lit up, and an unknown number flashed.

Qiao Mianmian picked it up.

The moment the call went through, an angry voice sounded. “Qiao Mianmian, you’re too cruel. How could you do this to me?

“You were the one who got someone to upload those scandals on Weibo, right? Do you know that you’ll ruin me by doing this? Qiao Mianmian, how could you be so cruel?!

“You vicious woman!”

It was Qiao Anxin.

Qiao Mianmian found it funny.

“I’m vicious?” Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but laugh. “Qiao Anxin, anyone can say such things, but you don’t have the right. You know very well what you’ve done to me. I just did the same.

“You deserve this.

“It wasn’t me who ruined you. It was you.”

Qiao Anxin was silent for a few seconds.

“Yes, Qiao Mianmian. I admit that I paid for you to appear on the trending search. But are you doing this to me just because I did something that didn’t affect you at all? Even if I made a mistake, it wasn’t very serious. But now, you’re trying to kill me. Aren’t you too ruthless?

“Actually, you’ve wanted to do this for a long time. You even hypocritically promised Dad that you wouldn’t make things difficult for me again. Qiao Mianmian, you’re too disgusting!” Qiao Anxin clenched her teeth.

Qiao Mianmian laughed out of anger. “You think that what you did doesn’t affect me because I found a way to solve it. If I was just a newbie without any background, would you still think the same? Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Qiao Anxin, it’s not that I want to kill you. It’s just an eye for an eye. I’m just returning what you’ve done to me in the same way. I promised Dad that I wouldn’t make things difficult for you, but that was based on the fact that you wouldn’t provoke me again.

“You’ve been hiding behind my back and doing this to me time and time again, and you expect me to not hold it against you? Do you think I’m a fool, or do you think that no one will find out what you’ve done, so you’re so fearless?

“It’s precisely because of Dad that I tolerated you time and time again. Otherwise, do you think I’d only settle scores with you now?”

“Again and again? I-I only did it this time!” Qiao Anxin sounded flustered.

“Qiao Anxin, do you really think that no one can find out what you’ve done?” Qiao Mianmian didn’t want to talk nonsense with her anymore. “There’s nothing more to say between us. I let you off before because I didn’t want to upset Dad.

“But now, I won’t be merciful to you anymore.”

“Qiao Mianmian, w-what do you mean!”

“Qiao Anxin, you have to pay the price for everything. Everything that happens from now on is your punishment. I won’t show you mercy anymore.” Qiao Mianmian hung up.
