Chapter 2280: She Would Be Afraid Too

“I encountered something here and got stuck.” Mo Shixiu’s voice was obviously anxious. “Sister Lin called me just now and said that something is happening at home. She asked me to go back immediately. What exactly happened? Luoli, don’t lie to me. I’m very worried about you.

“Mom went to look for you? What did she do?”

Jiang Luoli kept quiet.

There was another knock on the door. It was quick and violent.

Mo Shixiu heard the noise and said, “Luoli, say something. What did Mom do to you? Is someone knocking on the door? What happened?

“Are you trying to make me anxious?”

Jiang Luoli didn’t intend to ruin Mo Shixiu’s relationship with Madam Mo. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

But now, this couldn’t be avoided.

She originally thought that even if Madam Mo didn’t like her, she was still carrying the Mo family’s bloodline. On account of the child, Madam Mo wouldn’t do anything to her.

But she was wrong.

She thought too kindly of Madam Mo.

At this point, she had nothing to worry about.

No matter what, she had to protect herself and the baby.

No one could hurt them.

“Mo Shixiu, she knows about your withdrawal from the election. She thinks I’m behind this, so she brought a group of bodyguards over. The knocking you heard just now was them smashing the door.

“I’m hiding in your study room, but I don’t know how long the door can last. I also don’t know where they’ll take me and what your mom will do to me and the child. Mo Shixiu, to be honest, I’m really afraid now.” Jiang Luoli wasn’t a timid person, but she was really afraid now.

She thought Mo Shixiu would be back soon.

But when he said that he was stuck on the road, she panicked.

She wasn’t as bold as she thought.

If something happened, she would be afraid too.

Jiang Luoli’s voice was a little choked as she spoke. “Mo Shixiu, I don’t know what I did wrong. Why does your mom think that I’m the one who harmed you? Do you think we’re really not suitable for each other?

“Did I really harm you? If you weren’t with me, you wouldn’t have made the decision to withdraw from the election.”

Hence, just as Madam Mo said, she was really a jinx.

She affected Mo Shixiu’s future.

“What nonsense are you talking about?” Mo Shixiu lowered his voice. “Luoli, no matter what Mom says to you, don’t take it to heart. Remember, you’re my wife. You’re living with me, not with her.

“I know best whether you’re good or not. I’ve said it before, everything is up to me. You don’t affect me in any way. It doesn’t matter what others think of you. You just have to care what I think of you. Don’t let your thoughts run wild and don’t worry. I’ll rush back immediately.

“The door to the study room has been specially processed. As long as you don’t open it, no one can enter. Just stay inside and wait for me. At most, wait for another 10 minutes before I appear beside you. Luoli, trust me. I’ll protect you and our baby.”
