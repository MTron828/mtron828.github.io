Chapter 1080: Baby, Accept Your Loss

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

The line went dead.

As she listened to the disconnected tone from the phone, her emotions were indescribable.

“What’s wrong?” Mo Yesi saw her strange expression and turned to look at her. “Was it Big Brother who spoke to you just now?”

Qiao Mianmian was still immersed in the conversation between Mo Shixiu and Jiang Luoli.

She looked up slowly with a surprised expression for a while and nodded. “Yes, the person who spoke to me was Big Brother. He was with Luo Luo. He said that Luo Luo was drunk.”

“Drunk?” Mo Yesi raised his eyebrows and smiled. “Are you worried about her? If she’s with my brother, you have nothing to worry about. Don’t worry, my brother is a gentleman. He won’t do anything to her.”

Qiao Mianmian said, “Of course I know that Big Brother is a gentleman. I’m not worried that he’ll do anything to her.”

Mo Yesi looked at her wide eyes and touched her head. “What did Big Brother say to you that made you so shocked?”

Qiao Mianmian blushed at the thought of that conversation.

She looked hesitant.

She couldn’t let Mo Yesi know that his brother had been teased. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Otherwise, how would Jiang Luoli face him in the future?

“Nothing much, just that Luo Luo was drunk and he would send her home.”

“That’s it?” Mo Yesi didn’t believe her. “Baby, are you sure you didn’t lie to me? That’s all Big Brother told you? Then, why do you look so surprised?”

Qiao Mianmian pursed her lips. “Really. I’m surprised because... Luo Luo seems to be dating Big Brother.”

“Oh?” Mo Yesi didn’t seem surprised at all. “Did she tell you that she’s dating Big Brother?”

“She didn’t say.” Qiao Mianmian shook her head. “I heard her talking to Big Brother just now. From their conversation, it seems like they’re already a couple. Didn’t Luo Luo say that she would make things clear with Big Brother? Why did she...”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t expect Jiang Luoli to really not reject Mo Shixiu as Mo Yesi had predicted.

She thought that no matter how obsessed she was with Mo Shixiu’s looks, she wouldn’t lose her mind.

But now...

She seemed to know less about her best friend than the man beside her.

Mo Yesi chuckled. “She wouldn’t have been able to reject Big Brother’s handsome face. Baby, I remember we made a bet. Did you lose?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“Baby, you’ve lost.” Mo Yesi smiled happily. “Don’t forget what you promised me. If you lose, you have to promise me something.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Of course, she remembered.

She had never expected Jiang Luoli to be so disappointing.

“It’s not confirmed yet. Luo Luo is drunk, so what she said might not be true. I’ll ask her when she’s sober!” Qiao Mianmian’s legs went weak for some reason when she saw the man’s meaningful smile.

She secretly hoped that Jiang Luoli could work harder.

However, she already felt that there wasn’t much hope.

She knew very well what Jiang Luoli looked like when she was drunk.

Although Jiang Luoli was a good-looking dog, she would often shout at handsome guys as if she was brave.
