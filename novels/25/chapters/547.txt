Chapter 549: Please Don’t Do This to Me

Qiao Mianmian’s already slightly reddened face got even redder.

Even her little earlobes were slightly pink.

The way the man was eating this cake... was too sexy.

Especially when he kept his gaze on her the whole time. Qiao Mianmian felt as if she was the one being eaten, not the cake.

At this thought, her heart began pounding quickly again.

Her cheeks got warmer too.

What made it even worse was how the man licked the cream off the side of his lips, where she’d accidentally touched it with the spoon.

The way he licked was as sexy as it could possibly get.

He was such a flirt.

Qiao Mianmian wondered if he was doing it on purpose.

When Mo Yesi was done licking the cream, he said, “It’s good.” He then bit on the spoon lightly and said, “Baby, continue feeding me.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

He didn’t see how furious Shen Rou looked.

If she continued feeding him, Shen Rou’s glare was really going to kill her.

“Ah Si...”

A trembling voice broke the mood.

Qiao Mianmian turned around and saw Shen Rou’s bloodshot eyes. She looked sad and aggrieved as she looked at Mo Yesi.

She almost choked as she said, “Are you still angry with me? I know it was my fault that day. I shouldn’t have insulted Mianmian’s brother so harshly without figuring out the truth first.

“I know I did wrong.

“I’m willing to apologize to Mianmian. I’ll do anything as long as you forgive me.

“But please, don’t do this to me. I can’t deal with it.”

Mo Yesi turned around and saw how pitiful she looked, but he seemed unfazed. When he spoke, it was with a distant coldness. “What are you doing here? Didn’t I already tell you that I’m not free to meet you today?”

His cold attitude was a stark contrast from the gentle one he showed Qiao Mianmian just seconds ago.

When he looked at Qiao Mianmian, it was with love and gentleness.

But when facing Shen Rou, it was coldness and more coldness.

There was even distance in his eyes.

His attitude was killing Shen Rou.

The tears that welled up in her eyes finally trickled down her face.

Tearing up, she said, “Ah Si, do you have to be like this? You don’t have the time to meet me, but the moment you heard that Mianmian’s here, you actually walked out of an important meeting just to see her?

“Is this what you mean by not having time?

“You’ve got time for her, but not for me? Do you not have time, or do you not want to see me?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

It seemed like loving someone would really lower one’s IQ.

Shen Rou was a smart woman.

But why was she asking such a dumb question?

Was she going to be satisfied only when Mo Yesi said explicitly that he didn’t want to see her? Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

But, from what Mo Yesi said, it seemed like Shen Rou had informed him earlier that she was coming?

But had been rejected by him on the basis that he didn’t have the time?

Upon thinking about that, Qiao Mianmian felt a little flower of joy sprout in her heart. She suddenly felt like kissing Mo Yesi as a reward.

Mm, it seemed like her husband was very self-aware.
