Chapter 1082: Was She Really Drunk?

“You do, you do!” Jiang Luoli felt even more aggrieved. She cried and said, “You despise me. You want to break up with me. You don’t love me anymore. Men are all pigs. Why did you change your heart so quickly? Why don’t you like me anymore?

“Boohoo, how can you not like me? I like you so much, how can you not like me!”

Hearing the girl’s choked voice, Mo Shixiu lowered his head. When he saw her red eyes, his expression changed.

He immediately explained, “Don’t think too much. I have no regrets, and I have no intention of breaking up with you.”

“Then, you don’t like me anymore!” Jiang Luoli felt even more aggrieved. She blinked her eyes as tears welled up in them.

Mo Shixiu panicked when he saw her red eyes.

He said immediately, “I’ m not.”

“You just don’t like me anymore! You won’t even let me kiss you, you just don’t like me!” Jiang Luoli became more and more upset as she spoke. As tears fell onto her face, she suddenly pushed Mo Shixiu away and covered her face as she cried.

She cried very sadly.

She sobbed and complained, “You’re a liar, you’re a liar. I don’t want to believe your words anymore.”

“Don’t cry.” Mo Shixiu had never coaxed a girl before, let alone a crying girl. Seeing her crying her heart out, he was at a loss.

He didn’t know what to do or how to coax her.

He reached out to wipe the tears off the girl’s face, but he didn’t dare to do it too hard. His touch was soft and gentle, and his voice was unbelievably tender. “I’m not lying to you. I’m talking about when we get home. Now... we’re not home yet.”

The moist sensation on his fingertips and the girl’s tear-stained face gave him a strange feeling.

He showed a gentleness he had never shown before.

It was a gentleness that even he did not realize.

After crying for a while, Jiang Luoli raised her head and looked at him with teary eyes. “Not... not home yet?”

“Well, we haven’t reached home yet.” Looking at her red and swollen eyes, Mo Shixiu sighed softly and continued to wipe her tears. “So, don’t cry anymore. You’re already so old, yet you still cry all the time.”

“Then, will you kiss me when we get home?” Jiang Luoli was very persistent about this matter.

Mo Shixiu: “... Yes.”

He even suspected her drunkness.

She was already drunk, yet she could still remember something so clearly.

“Then, call me Baby.”

“...”

“Do you not love me anymore?”

“...”

“You don’t even call me Baby. You don’t love me anymore!”

“...”

“Boohoo, I knew it. You don’t like me anymore.”

Jiang Luoli pursed her lips and her eyes turned red again.

Seeing that she was about to cry again, Mo Shixiu’s face stiffened. His lips moved and said with difficulty, “... Baby.”

He had spent all his patience on Jiang Luoli.

Jiang Luoli finally got what she wanted. A satisfied and contented smile appeared on her face. She wrapped herself around Mo Shixiu again and shook his arm gently and then sweetly said, “I still need to hear my darling call me baby.”

The driver: “...”

He might have heard wrongly.

He must be hallucinating.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔
