Chapter 2031: Mianmian, You’re Not Joking With Me?

She blinked and asked again, “You said that Chairman Mo is your… husband? Mianmian, is this what you mean?”

“Mm, we’re already married.” Qiao Mianmian nodded.

Linda was speechless.

She had seen a lot as a top manager.

Nothing could surprise her.

But after hearing Qiao Mianmian’s words, she was shocked speechless.

This was unbelievable.

Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi were husband and wife?

They were already married?

Her artiste was actually the Young Madam of the Mo family?!

Linda couldn’t recover from the shock.

“Mianmian, you’re not joking with me?” Linda finally found her voice, but she still found it unbelievable.

Qiao Mianmian looked at her apologetically. “I’m sorry, Sister Xie. I’ve kept it from you for so long.”

“So, you married Chairman Mo before signing the contract?”

“Mm.”

Linda was speechless.

“Then, why did you sign the contract? Chairman Mo can easily find a much better manager than me to groom you. Moreover, you’re already the Young Madam of the Mo family, why do you still want to enter the entertainment industry?” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Young Madam Mo had everything she wanted.

Why did she come to the entertainment industry to be a newbie?

“Because you looked for me and spoke so sincerely, I thought I could give it a try. As for me entering the entertainment industry, it’s because I like acting.”

Linda was speechless.

“So you’re really the Young Madam of the Mo family?

“Am I going to be the Young Madam’s manager?”

“Sister Xie, no matter who I am, you’re still my manager. You can treat me the same way as before. I didn’t want to say it previously because I was afraid that it would change our relationship.”

Linda felt that she’d rather Qiao Mianmian not tell her about this.

Because when she found out that Qiao Mianmian was the Young Madam of the Mo family, she really didn’t know how to get along with her.

Qiao Mianmian sighed when she saw Linda’s reaction. “I knew I shouldn’t have said it. Then, forget about it. Just take it that I didn’t tell you anything, alright?”

Linda kept quiet for a while before bursting into laughter.

“To think that I was worried about whether you and Chairman Mo would make it to the end. I was really worried for nothing. Now it seems like I picked up a bargain.”

“Mm?” Qiao Mianmian blinked in confusion.

“You’re Young Madam Mo, you have all the resources you want. Your qualifications are good, and your acting is also good. You don’t lack resources, so you’ll definitely be popular in the future.

“I can see your future clearly now. I’ve made it.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“Now that I think about it, it’s all thanks to Su Ze’s blindness. If he hadn’t gotten together with Qiao Anxin, the two of you wouldn’t have broken up. If you hadn’t broken up, you and Chairman Mo wouldn’t have ended up married.

“It feels like everything has been arranged by fate.” Linda couldn’t help but sigh.

“Qiao Anxin thought that she had found a gem, but she didn’t know that the man she easily snatched away was nothing good. Oh right, Su Ze has returned. He didn’t harass you these few days, right?”
