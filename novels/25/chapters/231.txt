Chapter 232: What? Did You Really Break Up?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian blushed and went downstairs.

Qiao Chen asked suspiciously the moment he saw her, “Sister, why is your face so red? Are you feeling unwell?”

“No.”

In the face of Qiao Chen’s inquiring and suspicious gaze, Qiao Mianmian felt a moment of a guilty conscience.

As if she had been seen through.

Even if she knew it, Qiao Chen couldn’t possibly tell.

After all, Qiao Chen had never been in a relationship before.

But she blushed even harder at the thought of the shameful happening.

Her face was uncontrollably hot.

“Huh, where’s Brother-in-law?”

Qiao Mianmian looked around and saw that Mo Yesi hadn’t come down with her.

“Cough, cough, your brother-in-law... will be down soon.”

Her eyes flickered twice and her face turned red at the mention of Mo Yesi.

Seeing her reaction, Qiao Chen felt even more suspicious.

He frowned and stared at her. “Sister, are you hiding something from me?”

“I’m not!”

Her eyes flickered again, and she dared not look into his eyes. She buried her head and sat down opposite him, then picked up her chopsticks and randomly grabbed a piece of vegetable. “Chen Chen, your brother-in-law’s chef is very good. Give it a taste.”

Qiao Chen was speechless.

He felt like there was definitely something up.

His brother-in-law hadn’t come down yet, but she was already starting her meal?

His sister wasn’t such an impolite person.

Her unusual behavior seemed to be deliberately averting his focus.

“Sister, you-”

He was about to say something when Qiao Mianmian’s phone rang.

She breathed a sigh of relief when she heard her phone ring, and immediately took it out.

But when she looked down and saw the name displayed on the screen, her face fell.

The phone was still ringing, but Qiao Mianmian hesitated to answer the call.

Qiao Chen could tell that something was wrong and hurriedly asked, “Sister, who is it?”

Qiao Mianmian glanced up at him. “Aunt Su.”

Qiao Chen’s expression also changed. “Aunt Su? Sister, you already broke up with Su Ze, why is Aunt Su calling you?”

“I haven’t told them about our breakup.”

She thought for a moment before continuing, “Maybe she’s calling me because of this.”

The phone rang two or three more times before Qiao Mianmian picked it up hesitantly.

“Hello, Aunt Su.”

“Mianmian.” A middle-aged woman’s voice sounded agitated. She said in a high-pitched voice, “Su Ze told me that you have broken up with him, is that true?”

After a few seconds of silence, Qiao Mianmian replied, “Aunt Su, it’s true.”

“What? You really broke up? When did this happen, how come Uncle Su and I don’t know anything about it? Mianmian, why did you break up with Su Ze? Weren’t you guys doing well and about to get married?”

The middle-aged woman sounded very sad and she continued to whisper, “Mianmian, it was going well, why did you break up? You and Su Ze have known each other for so many years, I already treat you as my own daughter. How could you break up?

“Did Su Ze let you down? Tell me about it, I’ll help you lecture him.

“Mianmian, you can tell me if you have any problems. Uncle Su and I are definitely on your side. But breaking up is not a trivial matter, you can’t be so impulsive.”
