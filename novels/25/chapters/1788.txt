Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“I’m already at the filming location. I’ve just tidied up the room. From tomorrow onwards, my cell phone will be taken away during filming. I can only call you at night.”

“Mm, I know. Turn on the video, I want to see your place.”

Qiao Mianmian hesitated for a while before opening WeChat.

The call went through, and a handsome face appeared on the screen. The man’s entire face seemed to have been carved with a knife, and his facial features were beautiful and well-defined.

Qiao Mianmian looked at her husband’s handsome face on the screen and couldn’t help but be a little dazed. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Her husband... was so handsome.

This pair of eyes, this nose, this mouth, this entire facial structure, they were all ridiculously good-looking.

What kind of luck did she have?

She actually married such a good-looking, rich, and awesome husband.

“This is your place?”

Qiao Mianmian stared at Mo Yesi for a while and saw him frown.

The man sounded unhappy. “Why is the environment so bad?”

“I think it’s alright.” Qiao Mianmian walked around the room with her cell phone. She pointed at a refrigerator that looked “ancient” and said, “Do you know, my room is the largest and best. I drew the best lot.

“The others’ rooms are worse than mine.”

Mo Yesi was still frowning. “Can’t you change to a better room?”

“This room is already very good.” Qiao Mianmian was already satisfied with this living environment. She said lightly, “The house is a little old, but it’s clean. Moreover, the scenery in the courtyard is pretty good.

“Actually, it’s not bad to experience such a life occasionally.

“Alright, alright, don’t worry about me anymore.” Qiao Mianmian looked at the man’s expression and softened her tone. “The countryside is like this, how can you expect it to be like home?”

“I shouldn’t have let you go.” The man’s eyes were filled with heartache. “Isn’t it good to have someone to serve you at home? Why must you go to such a place to suffer?”

“This is an experience!” Qiao Mianmian was rather excited. “I think it’s rather interesting.”

“Forget it, let’s not talk about it anymore,” Mo Yesi said helplessly. “It’s getting late, we’ll have dinner soon. Have you thought about what to eat tonight?”

“Brother Zhao said there’s a bonfire party tonight. It sounds interesting.”

“Brother Zhao?”

“The host for this show.”

Mo Yesi nodded. “Don’t go wandering around at night. This place of yours is too remote and unsafe. No matter what you do, call a few more people along. Don’t go alone, alright?”

“I know.” Qiao Mianmian nodded. “Don’t worry, I’ll stay in the room obediently at night.”

“My cell phone is on 24/7. I won’t turn it off. Call me if you need anything.”

“Alright.”

“Just hand over your cell phone. But the one I prepared for you, you have to carry it with you at all times.”

“But the production crew made it clear that all cell phones have to be handed over.”

“I’ll get Wei Zheng to talk to them.”
