Chapter 2187: You’re the Only One Who Can’t Get Off The Stage

“Bless us?”

“Yes, congratulations.” Shen Rou took a deep breath and managed to put on her usual elegance. She raised her glass and smiled sincerely. “Ah Si, I wish you and Mianmian a blissful life.

“I know that some things have caused a misunderstanding between us. You might not believe me even if I say this now. But I really wish you all the best. Ah Si, we’ve known each other for over 20 years. You’re my best friend. I really hope you can live happily.

“This toast is to you and Mianmian.”

With that, she finished her drink.

Mo Yesi didn’t move.

Shen Rou felt awkward and embarrassed when Mo Yesi didn’t respond.

“Ah Si, don’t you believe me?” Feeling the mocking gazes around her, her cheeks burned.

Mo Yesi looked at her coldly. “There’s no need for blessings. Whether you’re sincere or not doesn’t mean anything to us. Drink this wine yourself, I won’t accompany you.”

Everyone started mocking her after he said that.

“Hahaha, this is so funny. So embarrassing.”

“She probably wanted to save face, so she pretended to be magnanimous. But Mo Yesi saw through her at first glance and didn’t fall for it.”

“What a joke. She even calls him Ah Si as if she has a good relationship with him. But Mo Yesi is really heartless. He didn’t leave her any face in front of so many people. She’s about to die from anger.”

“I think she’s about to cry.”

“Keep it down, don’t let her hear you. Otherwise, she’ll really cry.”

Shen Rou finally couldn’t take it anymore.

She looked up in embarrassment. “Mo Yesi, you…”

“Rourou, if you want to drink, look for me. Why are you looking for Second Bro? He doesn’t drink.”

Yan Shaoqing walked over and pulled Shen Rou to his side.

Before Shen Rou could finish her sentence, he pulled her into the crowd. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

As he walked, he said, “Come, come, come. I’ll drink with you. We haven’t seen each other for a long time. Let’s drink and catch up.”

“Yan Shaoqing, what are you doing? Let go of me.” Shen Rou struggled angrily.

“Don’t you want to drink? I’ll drink with you.” Yan Shaoqing ignored her and pulled her in another direction.

“Who wants to drink with you? Let go of me.” Shen Rou struggled, but she wasn’t as strong as him.

Yan Shaoqing pulled her to a quiet corner before letting go.

Shen Rou immediately rubbed her reddened wrist and glared at him. “Yan Shaoqing, what are you doing? Why did you pull me here?”

Yan Shaoqing looked at her speechlessly. “If I didn’t, what were you going to do? Do you still want to fight with Ah Si? Rourou, you know Ah Si’s temper. It’s not good for you to fight with him.

“You’ll be the only one in trouble.”

“Haha, it’s bad enough now. How worse can it get?”
