Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The next moment, the woman’s sharp and angry voice rang out. “You shameless woman. You’re seducing another man.”

The woman’s voice was very loud.

Qiao Mianmian was on the streets again.

Many passersby turned to look at them.

Everyone was shocked by her slap.

Qiao Mianmian also covered her face and only snapped back to her senses after a few seconds.

She just realized that she’d been hit.

She looked at the woman in the tight pink dress and recalled the slap. Her expression darkened, and she raised her hand to return the slap.

Su Ze pulled the woman behind him and turned around to question her. “What are you doing? Didn’t I tell you to wait for me over there? Why are you here?”

The woman looked at him angrily. “Su Ze, how dare you lie to me and say that she’s just an ordinary friend of yours. You’ve already been with her on the streets, do you still dare to say that you’re ordinary friends?

“Are you afraid that I’ll find out about your relationship?”

Su Ze’s expression darkened. “What nonsense are you talking about? Don’t be unreasonable.”

“I’m being unreasonable?” The woman turned around and glared at Qiao Mianmian. She pointed at her and said loudly, “Do you think I don’t know who she is? I remember now, I’ve seen her before.

“She’s your ex-girlfriend, Qiao Mianmian.

“Su Ze, you’ve already agreed to date me, and now you’re entangled with your ex-girlfriend. Who do you take me for?

“And you shameless woman. You’ve already broken up with Su Ze, but you’re still clinging to him. How can you be so shameless? Let me tell you, Su Ze already has a girlfriend. If you still want some face, don’t pester him anymore.

“That slap just now was just a lesson. If I find out that you’re still clinging to him, it won’t be as simple as a slap next time. I know you’re in the entertainment industry. You’re just a small actress. It’s easy to deal with you.

“You actors are so shameless. You’re willing to do anything just to get to the top. You know that Ah Ze is the President of Star Splendor now, so you want to rekindle your relationship with him and make yourself popular, right?”

The woman was deliberately loud.

The passers-by stopped in their tracks to watch the show.

Su Ze pulled the woman back with an awful expression. “Alright, stop it. It’s embarrassing even if you don’t feel ashamed in public. It’s not what you think. I’ll explain it to you later. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Let’s go back now. We’ll talk when we get back.”

“What shame?” The woman got even angrier when she heard what he said. She flung his hand away and pointed at his nose. “I didn’t do anything wrong. I have a clear conscience. What’s there to be ashamed of? If you want to be embarrassed, you guys are the ones to be embarrassed!

“Su Ze, I’m still here. What do you take me for?

“If you don’t like me, just tell me directly. Do you have to insult me like this?

“You’re having an ambiguous relationship with an actress while dating me. Su Ze, you’re insulting me!” The way the woman addressed Qiao Mianmian as an actress showed that she despised her status.
