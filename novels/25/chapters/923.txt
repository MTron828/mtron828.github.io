Chapter 924: I’ll Be Yours for the Rest of My Life

As for those external obstructions, she would treat them as obstacles in their relationship and try to overcome them.

He’d done so much for her.

She couldn’t just enjoy and accept his kindness and not be willing to do anything for him.

This was too unfair to him.

At this thought, Qiao Mianmian suddenly put down her chopsticks and gently grabbed Mo Yesi’s hand. “Mo Yesi, I’ll follow you well from now on. You said we’ll always be together, right?”

Mo Yesi was stunned for a while before quickly holding her hand back. “Mm, I’ve said it before. Baby, what’s wrong?”

He felt that Qiao Mianmian was acting strangely.

Qiao Mianmian smiled at him. “It’s nothing. I just feel that since you’re so good to me, I can’t let you down.”

Mo Yesi looked at her thoughtfully for a while before rubbing her head affectionately. “Why are you suddenly so emotional? Are you touched because I cooked for you?”

“Yes.” Qiao Mianmian squeezed her fingers between his and smiled sweetly. She looked up at him and said, “I’m touched. I suddenly feel like I did something good in my previous life to have such a good husband.”

Mo Yesi was stunned.

He looked at her deeply and stroked her hair gently. “Baby, then tell me, have I made you happy?”

Qiao Mianmian nodded.

At this moment, she felt so blissful.

“Really?” Mo Yesi’s eyes were as gentle as the moonlight on the window sill. “Do you really feel blissful being with me? Are those words from your heart?”

Qiao Mianmian nodded again. “Mm, from the bottom of my heart. Mo Yesi, we’ll be together forever, right?”

She furrowed her brows as she recalled her conversation with Madam Mo.

That conversation ended on bad terms. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Since Madam Mo wanted her to divorce Mo Yesi, she definitely wouldn’t let it go so easily.

If the negotiation failed, she wouldn’t let it go.

Qiao Mianmian was able to keep her heart firm. Mo Yesi wasn’t a mommy’s boy, and the Old Madam was someone she could rely on. Hence, she wasn’t afraid of Madam Mo interfering.

She was only worried that Madam Mo would go for the people around her.

If she pushed her too hard, this might not be impossible.

Qiao Mianmian hesitated to tell Mo Yesi about it.

“Of course.” Mo Yesi didn’t know what she was thinking. He took her worry as fear of separating from him. He held her hand tightly and kissed it.

The man’s voice was unbelievably gentle. “You’re already married to me. You’re my woman for the rest of your life. You have to be by my side, only by my side.”

“What about you?” The man’s domineering tone was full of possessiveness, but it made Qiao Mianmian feel especially sweet. She smiled and said, “I’ll be your woman for the rest of my life, then can you only be my man for the rest of your life?

“Only by my side?”

“Yes.” Mo Yesi held her hand and kissed the back of it like a loyal knight. “My dear wife, I’ll be yours for the rest of my life.”
