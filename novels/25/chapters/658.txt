Chapter 659: Tsk Tsk, It’s Really Tempting

Qiao Mianmian almost couldn’t recognize him.

On the day of her interview, Bai Yusheng didn’t shave. He looked completely different from the current him.

Without his beard, he looked at least six or seven years younger.

He looked more mature with a beard.

He looked like a young hunk now.

If she didn’t know his identity, Qiao Mianmian would have thought that he was a male artiste hired by the production crew.

After all, Bai Yusheng was definitely one of the most handsome directors in the entertainment industry.

He could debut right now if he wanted to.

Once Bai Yusheng got out of the car, not only Huang Yilin’s eyes lit up, but Qiao Mianmian’s eyes also lit up when she saw all the actresses on set, including the other female crew members.

Huang Yilin couldn’t care less about being exposed to the sun. She walked out from under the umbrella and quickly walked towards Bai Yusheng in her 10-centimeter high heels.

A few female artistes closer to Bai Yusheng wanted to greet him.

But when they saw Huang Yilin approaching, all of them took a step back.

It was as if they were afraid of something.

Nana’s eyes widened, and she said, “Sister Mianmian, did you see that? They seem to be afraid of Huang Yilin. Huang Yilin has a bad temper, don’t they say that she’s very down-to-earth and doesn’t put on airs?”

Qiao Mianmian saw it too.

After a few seconds of silence, she said thoughtfully, “I guess it’s because Huang Yilin is more popular. Is this... a form of respect for her as a senior?”

“Is that so?” Nana looked at Huang Yilin, who was already in front of Bai Yusheng, and nodded. “Perhaps. But Sister Mianmian, is that Director Bai? He’s so young, is he that handsome?” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Mm, that’s Director Bai.”

“He’s too young, he looks like a young hunk. With his looks, he can even be the male lead in the production team.”

Nana stared at Huang Yilin for a few seconds, then suddenly lowered her voice and said, “No wonder Huang Yilin was so agitated. She immediately went over when she saw Director Bai. I heard that Director Bai is a rich second-generation heir, and his family is very rich. Filming is purely his hobby. He’s the kind of person who would be forced to go home and inherit a billion yuan of wealth if he doesn’t do well...

“Tsk tsk, it’s really tempting.

“I guess all the female celebrities in the entertainment industry want to take him down.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She realized that Nana and Jiang Luoli really were alike.

Not only did they like good-looking people, but they were also gossipy.

But Huang Yilin’s reaction was too obvious.

Qiao Mianmian watched as she walked over and greeted Bai Yusheng with a smile. Bai Yusheng nodded, and the two of them exchanged a few more words. He suddenly looked up at Qiao Mianmian.

Qiao Mianmian was looking at him and Huang Yilin when Bai Yusheng looked up and met her eyes.

Qiao Mianmian was stunned for a few seconds.

She wondered if she should greet him when he walked towards her and greeted her. “Did you have a good rest last night? Did you take the crew’s car today?”

Qiao Mianmian’s eyes widened.

Nana’s eyes widened in shock.
