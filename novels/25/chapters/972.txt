Chapter 975: We’re Just Friends

The driver looked at her and nodded. “My daughter likes you. She said she’s your fan. Miss Qiao, you’re really pretty. I didn’t expect you to look even better in person. No wonder my daughter likes you so much.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

She blushed. “Ahem! Thank you, Uncle.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Miss Qiao, can you give me an autograph?” The driver scratched his head and said a little embarrassedly, “I want an autograph for my daughter. It’s her birthday tomorrow. If she can get your autograph, I’m sure she’ll be very happy.”

Qiao Mianmian looked at his shy expression and felt bad for thinking that he was trying to hit on her.

“Of course.” She nodded immediately. “You want an autograph, right? No problem. I have a pen here, where do you want me to sign?”

The driver didn’t expect her to agree so quickly. He immediately took out a small notebook and handed it to her excitedly. “Just sign on this. Miss Qiao, can you write the words ‘Happy 18th Birthday’? If I asked for too much, you can just sign it as you like.”

“No problem.”

This was nothing to Qiao Mianmian.

She quickly wrote: Happy 18th birthday to Little Fairy.

From: Your friend Qiao Mianmian.

After she was done, she handed the notebook back to him.

The driver took it and looked at it gratefully. “Thank you, Miss Qiao. Your handwriting is so beautiful. My daughter will be especially happy to see your blessings. The rumors online are really unbelievable. Miss Qiao, you’re so nice, how could it be like what they say?”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “Rumors online?”

“That’s right.” The driver looked up at her and said, “I saw the news with my daughter, and the internet made Miss Qiao... look terrible. But Miss Qiao is such an easygoing and gentle person, how could it be like what the internet said?

“But Miss Qiao, can I ask you a question? Of course, if I offend you verbally and you don’t want to answer, you don’t have to bother about me.”

Qiao Mianmian hesitated for a while before nodding. “Alright, ask away.”

The driver thought for a while before saying, “I saw someone say that Miss Qiao has an unusual relationship with your director. Are these also untrue scandals?”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

She looked at the honest-looking taxi driver in front of her and a trace of suspicion flashed past her eyes.

But even though she found the question a little strange, she still replied, “Are you talking about Director Bai? We’re just friends. He’s my director, and I’m just an actress under him. That’s all.”

“I see.” The driver smiled and said, “It seems like the rumors online are really unbelievable. Miss Qiao, thank you so much for signing this for me. This is definitely the best birthday gift for my daughter.”

“Uncle, you’re too kind. I should be thanking your daughter for liking me and supporting me.”

...

Qiao Mianmian alighted from the taxi and put on her mask again.

She didn’t tell Mo Yesi beforehand that she was coming.

She walked straight to the front desk.
