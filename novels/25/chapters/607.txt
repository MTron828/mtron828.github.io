Chapter 610: Are You Saying That You Fell in Love With Me Because I Saved You?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“I didn’t confess since you didn’t want me to.

“If you and Ah Si can be together, I will give you my blessings. But you still can’t let go even though Ah Si is married. I really don’t want to hear how much you love and cherish him.

“Do you think I won’t feel hurt?”

With that, Gong Zeli went silent.

Shen Rou also kept quiet for a long while.

She had avoided this for so many years. Now, she finally had to face it.

“Forget it. Pretend I didn’t say anything,” Gong Zeli said after a few minutes of silence. “I take back what I’ve said, just pretend that you didn’t hear it.”

But how could she pretend that she didn’t hear all that?

Moreover, Shen Rou gave him the opportunity to say it.

“I’ve heard everything clearly. How can I pretend that I did not?” Shen Rou pretended to be shocked. “Ze Li, whatever that you just said, is it... true? You’re not joking with me?”

Gong Zeli lowered his voice and said, “Do you think I will joke about this matter?”

“But, why...”

“You said that you treated me as a younger sister.”

“Yes, 10 years ago, I did treat you as a younger sister.”

10 years ago...

Shen Rou suddenly recalled that night.

Her heart thumped, and she tightened the grip on her cell phone unconsciously.

“Then why...” She already had the answer.

“Rourou, do you still remember that night 10 years ago? It was my birthday, and we fought because of something. I was in a bad mood and went alone to the backyard, but I accidentally fell into the swimming pool.

“That time, I didn’t know how to swim.

“I was struggling in the water screaming for help, but nobody came to rescue me. Just as I thought I was going to die, you appeared and saved me. When I opened my eyes and saw you, I realized that you were the one who saved me. Did you know how I felt after that?”

Gripping her phone even tighter, her expression changed. She bit her lip and said, “How?”

“I told myself to treat you well forever. And when I grow up, I will marry you and dote on you forever, without letting you experience any hardship.

“Ever since I had that thought, I never treated you as a younger sister anymore.

“So...”

Shen Rou was expressionless after listening to what he said.

Recalling that night, her expression changed again. She clenched her fists and replied, “Are you saying you fell in love with me because I saved you?”

“Yes.”

Gong Zeli’s revelation came as a shock to her.

She’d never imagined that Gong Zeli fell in love with her because of what happened that night.

So, if that didn’t happen, he... would never have liked her?

But that night...

10 years had passed.

But she still couldn’t forget what happened.

It was etched in her mind.

She dreamt about and relived that night many times.

But what was different from reality was that she was exposed in her dream.

The little girl that saved Gong Zeli exposed her in public and said that she was lying.
