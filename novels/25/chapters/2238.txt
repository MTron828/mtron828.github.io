Chapter 2241: She Wanted to Hide Herself in His Arms

“As a future father, I have to take good care of them.”

Madam Mo’s expression stiffened.

“Since Shixiu and Luoli have chosen to stay in Yuncheng City, let her stay here. I think it’s better for her to stay by Shixiu’s side. They’re newlyweds, how can they be apart for so long?

“Although the place you mentioned is good, I’m still worried about Luoli going alone.” Old Madam also expressed her attitude.

“Since you all think so, then don’t go. I’m doing this for Luoli’s sake.”

Old Madam said, “You’re indeed kind, but since they’re unwilling to separate, let them be.”

Madam Mo pursed her lips and kept quiet.

…

After dinner.

Mo Shixiu and Jiang Luoli didn’t stay at the Mo Residence. After dinner, they chatted with the Old Madam for a while before leaving.

Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi didn’t stay the night and left the Mo Residence with them.

On the way back.

It was a little cold outside. Mo Shixiu held Jiang Luoli’s hand and placed it in his coat pocket. “Why is your hand a little cold? Are you feeling cold?”

He added, “Wear more clothes when you go out next time. Don’t get cold.”

“Mm, I got it.” Jiang Luoli held his hand tightly.

Mo Shixiu’s hands were as warm as his arms.

Jiang Luoli wanted to hide in his arms.

Because in her eyes, Mo Shixiu was a huge heater.

“Mo Shixiu, Mom asked me to go overseas to nurse my pregnancy today, but I rejected her. Will she be unhappy?” Jiang Luoli thought for a while and continued, “I know she’s doing this out of goodwill, but I don’t want to go overseas at all. I’ll be afraid to go to a foreign place alone.

“Moreover…

Jiang Luoli turned around and hugged him, rubbing her cheek against his chest coquettishly. “I don’t want to leave you. No matter how good the outside world is, it’s not as good as my husband. I don’t want to go anywhere. I just want to be with you.”

Mo Shixiu looked at her rubbing against him like a kitten. He chuckled and reached out to pat her head. “Mm, then don’t go anywhere. Don’t worry, she won’t be unhappy.”

“What if she is? I think Mom is angry. Will she think that I don’t know what’s good for me and deliberately reject her favor?”

“That’s nothing. You’re the one carrying the baby. Of course, it’s up to you.”

“Mo Shixiu, you’re so good.” Jiang Luoli reached out and hooked her arm around his neck. She blinked and smiled cheekily. “It’s so good to be married to you. Thankfully, you changed your mind and insisted on making me your girlfriend. Otherwise, I’d have missed such a good husband.

“No, that’s not right. Thankfully, the person who met you that night was me and not another woman. But tell me honestly, if you met another woman that night, would you have slept with her too?”

Jiang Luoli’s words were so straightforward that Mo Shixiu was stunned for a while before saying in amusement, “If I said I would, would you be very angry?”

Jiang Luoli was upset.

She punched him in the chest and said with a straight face, “Mo Shixiu, what do you mean? If it was another woman, you would really…”
