Chapter 2939: It Must Be Like This

Translator: Atlas Studios| Editor: Atlas Studios

That must be it.

“Poor thing, you won’t have the chance to see how wonderful this world is in

the future. Poor thing, don’t be so unlucky in your next life.”

Tang Ya clenched her fists.

Her eyes were fixated on the little girl’s exquisite and beautiful face. She

wanted to see if this little girl, who was sleeping soundly and was about to lose

her life, would continue sleeping if her breathing wasn’t smooth.

Could she still sleep then?

It wouldn’t be too painful if her life ended in her sleep.

Just as Tang Ya tightened her grip, the little girl finally felt uncomfortable. Her

sweet smile was gone, taking the dimples with it.

Her thick and long eyelashes fluttered twice before she slowly opened her eyes.

The moment the little girl opened her eyes, Tang Ya felt as if someone had hit

her acupoint. Her fingers on the little girl’s neck stiffened. She could have

easily broken her neck with just a little more force, but she couldn’t do it.

She saw a pair of eyes prettier than the stars.

The little girl’s eyes were clear and bright, like ripe grapes. Her eye circles were

very bright, and her eyes seemed to speak as she looked at you.

The little girl blinked curiously and giggled.

She smiled sweetly.

Her laughter was crisp and clear, like the clinking of siver bells.

She even made some sounds. Tang Ya’s eyes were filled with gentleness.

Especially when the little girl smiled at her, she actually wanted to touch her

head.

She really reached out.

Seeing her hand in mid-air, she finally seemed to snap out of her daze. She

looked at her outstretched hand and then at the little girl who was still giggling

at her. Her expression turmed awful.

Damn it.

What was wrong with her?

She actually softened.

She actually went soft on the same person twice.

This wasn’t her style.

Tang Ya hated the feeling of not being in control. Moreover, the person who

made her lose control twice in a row was a little girl who was still drinking

milk.

She didn’t believe that she could be affected by a little girl again and again.

As if to prove that she wouldn’t be affected by anyone, Tang Ya reached out to

the little girl again.

A hint of viciousness flashed past her eyes.

This time, she wouldn’t be soft-hearted.

Just as Tang Ya was about to strangle her, her cell phone rang.

Tang Ya hesitated for a while before slowly retracting her hand.

She looked down at the little girl who was still smiling at her without a care in

the world and clenched her teeth. “Little împ, Ill end your life later. Ill let you Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

live for a few more minutes.”

Tang Ya picked up her cell phone and sawa familiar number on the screen.

She sneered as she looked at the familiar number..
