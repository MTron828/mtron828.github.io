Chapter 2130: Qiao Chen Knew Her Secret!

As soon as Father Qiao said that, he saw Lin Huizhen’s face turn pale.

His heart sank.

“Husband, y-you want to do a paternity test?” Lin Huizhen looked as if she had been wronged. Her eyes reddened and tears rolled down her cheeks. “You don’t believe me? Husband, I really didn’t do anything to let you down.

“You don’t believe me, but you take an outsider’s words seriously.”

Seeing how sad she was, Father Qiao wavered.

But his suspicion didn’t go away, he had to find out.

Especially when it concerned the Qiao family.

Qiao Anxin was his only daughter.

If he didn’t get to the bottom of this, he would have a knot in his heart.

What really made Father Qiao determined to investigate this matter was that Qiao Chen was the one who said it.

He wouldn’t believe anyone else.

But Qiao Chen never lied.

At this thought, the wavering gaze in Father Qiao’s eyes quickly disappeared.

He looked at Lin Huizhen, whose eyes were red and swollen from crying. His attitude was unprecedentedly domineering. “If you want to prove your innocence, then do a paternity test. If Chen Chen slandered you, I’ll naturally give you an explanation.

“But if you really betray me.” Father Qiao clenched his fists. “I won’t let you off easily.”

Seeing his domineeringness, Lin Huizhen panicked.

She thought that Father Qiao wouldn’t suspect her anymore if she showed weakness and cried.

Because that’s what always happened.

But she didn’t expect it to be useless this time.

Father Qiao still insisted on doing the paternity test.

It was all because of Qiao Chen.

Lin Huizhen didn’t know how Qiao Chen learned about this. She turned around and glared at him.

The secret she’d kept for so many years was revealed by this short-lived ghost.

Lin Huizhen would never do a paternity test.

She didn’t dare to go.

Because what Qiao Chen said was true.

Qiao Anxin wasn’t Father Qiao’s daughter, but her lover’s.

Back then, for materialistic reasons, she chose Father Qiao, who was rather rich and had good qualities.

But after marrying him, she didn’t completely cut ties with her lover. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Lin Huizhen liked her lover.

But she was a practical woman who prioritized her interests.

Her lover wasn’t as rich as Father Qiao. In order to live well in the future, she chose to marry Father Qiao.

But on the other hand, she was still thinking about her lover after their marriage. Her lover was also thinking about her, so the two of them got together again.

Then, Qiao Anxin was conceived.

That was when Father Qiao went overseas and she was with her lover.

Later, Lin Huizhen went to the hospital to check on her period and realized that it wasn’t the right time. Hence, she lied to Father Qiao that Qiao Anxin was a premature baby.

Back then, her relationship with Father Qiao was very good. They were newlyweds, so when she said that the baby was born prematurely, Father Qiao believed her.

After that, Father Qiao never suspected her again.

Lin Huizhen thought that this matter was over.

Father Qiao would never find out the truth.

She didn’t expect Qiao Chen to know her secret!

“Aunt Lin, didn’t you say that I was slandering you? It’s time to prove your innocence. As long as you do a paternity test, we’ll know who lied.” Qiao Chen looked at her fearlessly.
