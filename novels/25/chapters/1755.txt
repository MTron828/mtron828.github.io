Chapter 1758: Strongly Requesting for the Production Team to Change!

Female guests: Shen Fei, Little Xiao, Qiao Anxin, Song Ke, and Qiao Mianmian.

Male guests: Zhan Bo, Ren Jun, Su Mufei, Han Yan, and Zhao Yixiang.

When the guest list was released and they saw that Qiao Mianmian was one of the guests for the next episode, many netizens were unhappy.

They all left comments in the comment section, asking the production crew to change it. Otherwise, they wouldn’t watch the next episode.

“Why is it Qiao Mianmian again? She’s just a nobody, what right does she have to participate in such a show!”

“It’s different to have an awesome boyfriend. You can get whatever resources you want.”

“The production crew must be crazy. They don’t want the ratings anymore. Gosh, I really hate Qiao Mianmian. With her around, I really don’t want to watch the next episode.”

“I strongly urge the production crew to change it! I don’t want to see Qiao Mianmian at all.”

“I think the production crew should change the person. The Meaning of Traveling has been doing it for a few episodes. It wasn’t easy to accumulate a good reputation. If it’s ruined because of someone, it’s not worth it.”

These netizens even went to Qiao Mianmian’s Weibo and told her to be more self-aware and not appear on the show.

“Qiao Mianmian, don’t be so shameless. Why are you everywhere?”

“I’ll have to trouble some people to be self-aware. With your status, what right do you have to be on a variety show with a group of big shots? It’s disgusting to walk behind the scenes so openly.”

“A C-lister has to have self-awareness. We don’t want to see you on such a good show. It’ll affect our mood, do you understand? Please don’t drag the entire show’s ratings down.”

Qiao Mianmian’s fans couldn’t tolerate it.

They rebutted. “What do you mean by C-list? Everyone starts from the C-list, why shouldn’t they have good resources? Just based on your words? Ridiculous.”

“I can tell. Sisters, our Mianmian’s resources are getting better and better. Some people must be anxious and jealous. I advise some people that if they have the time to defame Mianmian here, it’s better to persuade your master. Jealousy is useless. People are unfair. So what if Mianmian has the backing? If she’s capable, she can go backstage too.”

“Being able to get resources from the backstage is also an ability. Not everyone can do it. The more haters Mianmian has, the more popular she is now. You haters can continue to flame her. Just treat it as increasing Mianmian’s popularity. Her fans are happy to see it, too.”

The fans attacked the haters, the haters attacked the fans, and soon, Qiao Mianmian’s latest post had tens of thousands of comments.

Qiao Mianmian had no idea what was happening.

She was accompanying Old Madam in the hospital.

After a good night’s rest, Old Madam looked much better today.

Qiao Mianmian peeled one fruit and handed it to her. “Grandma, have some fruit.”

Old Madam smiled and took it.

“Girl, aren’t you bored?” Old Madam looked at the little girl sitting by the bed and said with pity in her eyes, “If you’re bored, go do your own thing. You don’t have to accompany me here.”
