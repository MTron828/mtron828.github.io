Chapter 1605: Intentionally Made Someone Popular

She couldn’t figure it out.

What was wrong with her? Why was Gong Zeli so cold to her?

This was the first time she cooked for a man, but he despised her so much.

Besides him, she hadn’t done this for any other man.

But he didn’t appreciate it at all.

Shangguan Qing had never suffered such setbacks and grievances before. She cried all alone in the car. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Her eyes were red and swollen from crying when her cell phone rang.

It was from one of her best friends.

Shangguan Qing wiped her tears and picked it up.

“Qingqing, you told me that your family and the Gong family are trying to set you up with Gong Zeli. Are you two together now?”

Hearing that name, Shangguan Qing’s heart ached again. She bit her lip and said sadly, “Why are you asking this?”

“Qingqing, are you crying? Did you see the news today?” Her best friend was shocked to hear her sobbing.

Shangguan Qing wiped her tears. “What news?”

“It’s the scandal between Gong Zeli and that newbie in the entertainment industry. But don’t be too upset. After all, it’s just a scandal, it might not be true. Perhaps that newbie wants to ride on his popularity and deliberately let others hype it up.”

Shangguan Qing was stunned.

A few seconds later, she reacted and her expression turned awful. “You’re saying that Brother Zeli has a scandal with a newbie in the entertainment industry?”

“Why, you don’t know about this?”

“I don’t know. I don’t care about the entertainment industry.”

“Then, you can go take a look now. If you wait any longer, you might not be able to see anything. Gong Zeli is rather protective of that newbie and removed all the trending topics related to her. I’ve seen it; that newbie’s name is Qiao Mianmian. She’s really good-looking.

“Not only did she have a scandal with Gong Zeli, but she also had a scandal with Bai Yusheng and Tu Yilei. Even Qin Han had a scandal with her. In any case, she doesn’t look like a good person. Maybe she wants to rely on her looks.

“Moreover, this isn’t the first time Gong Zeli has been involved in a scandal with her. There have been a few rumors about it before. Because of her, Gong Zeli hit the CEO of a management company at a KTV last night and caused him to be hospitalized. Qingqing, I’m calling to tell you that if you really get together with Gong Zeli, you have to watch out for this vixen.”

After hanging up, Shangguan Qing opened Weibo with a terrible expression.

She had a Weibo account, but she rarely logged in.

After entering Weibo, she followed what her best friend said and searched for “Gong Zeli and Qiao Mianmian’s scandals”.

Soon, many related Weibo posts appeared.

After more than 10 minutes, Shangguan Qing found Qiao Mianmian’s Weibo.

Qiao Mianmian’s Weibo profile picture was of a cat. She clicked on her Weibo profile and found a few selfies.

Qiao Mianmian was practically bare-faced in the photos.

And it was taken without any filters.

Not many female celebrities could do this.

And not many female celebrities dared to post their untouched up selfies.

But because of this, Shangguan Qing was so jealous that her expression changed.

Other female celebrities’ bare-faced photos were very different from when they wore makeup.
