Chapter 510: My Most Beloved Hubby

Mianmian: [Mm.]

Jiang Luoli: [But shouldn’t Prince Charming be at work now? Unless... you and Prince Charming did it in the office?]

Mianmian: [Mm.]

Jiang Luoli: [Office play? Damn, that’s so thrilling. Prince Charming looks so serious all the time, who knew that he had this side to him. We really can’t judge a book by its cover.]

Mianmian: [...]

Jiang Luoli: [Prince Charming is so energetic, but you’re so small, can you take it? Since he doesn’t need the supplements, you can have them. You’ve got to build your constitution.]

Mianmian: [... I’m going to sleep, we can talk later.]

Mo Yesi didn’t intend to reply to Jiang Luoli anymore after that message.

He was going to lock her phone when he suddenly thought of something. He went into her WeChat and looked through her media gallery.

He looked through everything she posted on her account.

It didn’t take long.

Qiao Mianmian hardly posted anything. She’d registered her account for almost four years, but there were only a few tens of posts.

Most of it was about her work.

There was barely anything about her personal life.

And when she did post something about her personal life, they were always photos with Jiang Luoli.

Mo Yesi went through the whole gallery and didn’t see a single trace of Su Ze. He felt comforted.

And very happy about it.

Not only was there nothing about Su Ze, but there was also nothing to do with other male friends.

This made him less worried now.

Having looked through her Weibo account, he went back to her WeChat messages.

Seeing that almost everyone she’d exchanged messages with were female and that the few males were just older men, Mo Yesi felt even more at ease.

Very good.

She hadn’t added the contacts of any young men.

Otherwise, he would really be worried.

What if the young men wanted to flirt with her?

Although he believed that she wouldn’t cheat on him, just the thought of other men eyeing his wife was discomforting enough.

Mo Yesi did a thorough check on her WeChat and was about to log out when he decided to add his number on her account.

Both of them had always been contacting each other via text message.

They hadn’t exchanged each other’s WeChat accounts yet.

Mo Yesi had a registered cell phone number under his WeChat account, but he hardly ever used it. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

That was why he never thought of adding Qiao Mianmian on that platform.

But now, he changed his mind.

He personally felt that WeChat was dispensable to him.

But this was the app Qiao Mianmian used.

It was time for him to change his ways for his wife.

He decided to add Qiao Mianmian to his “close friends” list. That way, he’d be able to check out her posts whenever he wanted to.

He could understand her better this way.

Mo Yesi opened his “close friends” list and confirmed the request he’d sent from her end.

He then renamed her contact in his WeChat as “My Baby.”

Thereafter, he opened WeChat on Qiao Mianmian’s cell phone and changed his own contact name to “My Hubby.”

After typing those words, he suddenly felt that it wasn’t enough. He deleted it and renamed it “My Most Beloved Hubby.”
