Chapter 1091: She Still Felt Sad

A few minutes later.

Qiao Mianmian lay in his arms, panting lightly, her face flushed.

Mo Yesi smoothed her hair and touched her flushed cheeks. “I’m almost done with my work. What do you want to do tonight?” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Qiao Mianmian looked at the time. It was quite early.

“How about we pick Chen Chen up for dinner?” Qiao Mianmian hadn’t seen Qiao Chen in a while and missed him.

Mo Yesi nodded. “Okay, let’s pick Chen Chen up first. I haven’t seen him in a while.”

Mo Yesi liked his brother-in-law very much. Although it was partly because of Qiao Mianmian, Qiao Chen was also very likable.

After confirming this matter, Qiao Mianmian sent Qiao Chen a WeChat message.

...

Qiao Chen usually stayed in school.

Because Qiao Mianmian had gone to F City for filming, even though he had his own room at Mo Yesi’s place, he still stayed in school during the weekend and didn’t go over to Mo Yesi’s place.

Mo Yesi was already his brother-in-law.

But he hadn’t spent much time with him.

Qiao Chen was very happy to receive Qiao Mianmian’s message.

He hadn’t seen her for a while, and he was very close to her. Even though it hadn’t been long, he still missed her.

After the siblings agreed on a time, Qiao Chen went back to the dormitory to change and then went to the school gate to wait.

While he was waiting, a black Bentley drove over and stopped beside him.

Qiao Chen’s expression changed slightly when he saw the car.

Soon, he saw a familiar petite figure come out and walk towards the black Bentley.

When she saw Qiao Chen standing by the streetside, the petite figure stopped in her tracks and looked into his eyes for a few seconds before continuing to walk forward.

Qiao Chen wanted to turn around and leave, but his feet seemed to have grown roots, and he couldn’t take a single step.

When the petite figure walked past him, he straightened his body and clenched his fists.

He turned his head away, casting his gaze down the busy street, trying not to look at her.

Even so, he could still see her in his peripheral vision.

He would still pay attention to her.

“Qiao Chen.”

The petite figure suddenly stopped and called out to him softly.

Qiao Chen tensed up even more.

Instantly, his heart raced.

He took a deep breath, clenched his fists, and slowly turned around.

Shen Xin stood not far away from him and looked at him quietly.

Qiao Chen looked up and met her gaze. After a moment of silence, he asked, “Student Shen, what’s the matter?”

Hearing his address, Shen Xin’s lips curled into a bitter smile. “Nothing much, I just saw you and wanted to greet you. Where are you going? Do you want a drive... I’ll send you there.”

Qiao Chen was stunned. He shook his head and refused. “Thank you, but my sister will come and pick me up later.”

“Is that so?” Shen Xin knew that he wasn’t lying to her, but she still felt sad.
