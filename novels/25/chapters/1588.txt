Chapter 1589: Are You... Worried About Me?

He knew she was just stopping him.

But that touch made him unable to calm down.

Qiao Mianmian looked up and saw that he was in a daze.

A little worried, she waved her hand in front of his face. “Gong Zeli, what’s wrong? Say something. Are you injured? Do you want to go to the hospital?”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t have a good impression of Gong Zeli.

Even though he helped her a few times.

She only had a slightly better impression of him.

When she was with Gong Zeli, she wasn’t as relaxed as when she was with Yan Shaoqing and Lu Rao.

She could treat Yan Shaoqing and Lu Rao as friends.

But towards Gong Zeli...

Thinking about his relationship with Shen Rou, Qiao Mianmian couldn’t treat him as a friend.

But no matter what, Gong Zeli was injured because of her.

She had to show some concern.

This time, Gong Zeli seemed to have finally heard her. His expression and eyes changed.

He opened his eyes and looked at Qiao Mianmian.

He could see the worry in her eyes.

Even though he knew she was worried about him, his heart still trembled because of her gaze.

He pursed his lips and kept quiet for a few seconds. He looked down at the blood on the back of his hand and casually wiped it. He said calmly, “I’m fine. I’m not injured. This isn’t my blood.”

“Not your blood. Is it...”

Qiao Mianmian quickly recalled where the blood came from and was slightly relieved. “That’s good. I thought you were injured.”

Gong Zeli looked down at the blood on the back of his hand and then slowly looked up. Something flickered in his eyes as he looked at her and he said softly, “If I’m injured, will you... worry about me?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

He regretted it the moment the words left his mouth.

Qiao Mianmian was shocked too.

Gong Zeli looked into her eyes and clenched his fists to hide the panic in his heart. “If you don’t want to answer, you don’t have to. I was just asking.”

“I’ll worry.”

Although Qiao Mianmian felt that his question was a little strange, she couldn’t figure out why.

She thought for a while before replying, “You were injured because of me, of course I’m worried.”

This was expected.

But Gong Zeli still felt very comfortable and satisfied.

No matter why she was worried about him, he felt that everything was worth it.

He couldn’t help but smile. When he looked at her, a hint of gentleness flashed past his eyes, and his tone was so gentle that others couldn’t feel it. “Let’s leave first and find a new place to talk.”

Gong Zeli had just beaten up Boss Huang. Everyone else in the room was so shocked that their faces turned pale.

They were afraid they would become the next Boss Huang.

After all, they’d made a commotion before.

If Qiao Mianmian really wanted to pursue it, they could be considered accomplices.

These people had heard of Gong Zeli’s achievements when he was young. Who wouldn’t be afraid?

They were even more afraid when they saw how Gong Zeli beat Boss Huang up.
