Chapter 2723: Another Competitor

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Little Qiao did well just now.” Even Xu Jin, who had always been difficult, praised Qiao Mianmian after hearing the director and Shen Fei’s conversation. “Be it physical or emotional, she performed well.”

“See, even our Best Actor Xu feels that she’s not bad. Mianmian, do you know that it’s harder than ascending to the heavens to be praised by our Best Actor Xu?” Shen Fei smiled and said, “That mouth of his, who knows how many girls he has scolded and made to cry. This is the first time I’ve seen him praise someone like this.”

“Senior Xu, do you really think I did well just now?” Qiao Mianmian looked up at Xu Jin.

She was prepared to be scolded.

But she received a compliment instead?

“It was pretty good.” Xu Jin’s serious-looking “dean” face was actually gentle and even a little smiling. “Especially your crying scene. It’s really infectious.”

Qiao Mianmian was overjoyed. “Thank you for your affirmation, Senior Xu.”

She was even happier to be praised by Xu Jin.

“But…” Xu Jin suddenly changed his tone.

Qiao Mianmian immediately put on a humble expression. “Please enlighten me, Senior Xu.”

Xu Jin didn’t have a good impression of Qiao Mianmian.

He even felt some prejudice.

He heard that this pretty girl was from a rich family and married a powerful husband.

In Xu Jin’s opinion, such a person entering the entertainment industry was probably just for fun.

It was impossible to take acting seriously.

She must have relied on her connections to get the second female lead role.

But his prejudice against Qiao Mianmian vanished less than a minute after they officially entered the scene.

By the time the scene ended, Xu Jin’s impression of Qiao Mianmian had completely changed.

His initial prejudice turned into admiration.

Xu Jin was very willing to give advice to the younger generation he admired. He thought for a while and said seriously, “There’s no big problem, just some details. Once you’re immersed in a certain emotion, you’ll neglect some details.

“If only you could pay more attention to the details.”

Qiao Mianmian valued this valuable opinion and immediately nodded. “Thank you for Senior Xu’s suggestion, I’ll take note in the future.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Mm, there’s no rush. Take your time. When you film a few more shows in the future and gain more experience, you’ll naturally be able to do better.” Xu Jin saw that she was so upright and admired her even more.

This young lady was very polite. She didn’t feel superior just because of her status and background. She addressed him as “Senior” so easily.

Xu Jin really felt that this girl would become the second Shen Fei in the future.

She might even surpass her.

Shen Fei had another competitor for the next Best Actress Award.

…

The next two months of filming went very smoothly.

It went so smoothly that the supposed three months needed to film everything ended half a month in advance.

On this night, Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but drink a little.

When she followed the crew out of the clubhouse drunk and saw a familiar tall figure standing beside a Lamborghini parked outside the clubhouse, she thought she was seeing things..
