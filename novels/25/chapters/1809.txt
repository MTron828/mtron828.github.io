Chapter 1812: I Have No obligation to Cook for You

“He’s afraid of being forced to do manual labor. If he’s not full, he won’t have the energy to do it.”

“My Junjun is also very cute. Qiao Mianmian’s food must be very good. Junjun can’t stop eating.”

“Didn’t you realize that Su Mufei and Zhan Bo wanted to eat the last piece of pumpkin pie? Their chopsticks fell on it together. I want to taste Qiao Mianmian’s pumpkin pie.”

A group of fans was commenting about their idols. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Because of this video, Qiao Mianmian gained a lot of fans.

And it was because of her that the topic of making pumpkin pies became popular.

...

After dinner, Zhan Bo, Su Mufei, and the rest took the initiative to wash the dishes. Qiao Mianmian didn’t stand on ceremony. She wiped her mouth after eating and let them to it.

She was the one who made the food, so she definitely couldn’t wash the dishes.

If she did everything, wouldn’t she be a servant?

Her cell phone rang. Qiao Mianmian took it out and saw that Mo Yesi had sent her a WeChat message: [I want to eat your pumpkin pie, too.]

Qiao Mianmian was stunned to see this message and replied: [How did you know I made pumpkin pie this morning?]

Mo Yesi: [I saw it on Weibo.]

Qiao Mianmian immediately opened Weibo and found that she was trending because of the pumpkin pie.

She replied: [I’ll do it.]

Mo Yesi probably didn’t understand these online terms and sent her a “?”.

Qiao Mianmian: [I’ll make it for you when I get back.]

Mo Yesi: [Alright. Did you sleep well last night? Are you used to it over there?]

Qiao Mianmian: [Mm, I slept pretty well.]

Mo Yesi: [You heartless girl.]

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Mo Yesi: [I can’t sleep well. I can’t sleep well without you around.]

Qiao Mianmian looked at his reply and couldn’t help but laugh. [Then, what should I do? Do you want me to sing you a lullaby tonight?]

Mo Yesi: [Alright.]

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

After chatting for a while, Qiao Mianmian felt an unfriendly gaze on her.

She looked up and saw Qiao Anxin staring at her.

Qiao Mianmian looked away after a few seconds.

“Qiao Mianmian.”

On the other side, Song Ke had just finished scrolling through Weibo when she saw that the video comment section of The Meaning of Traveling’s official Weibo account was actually full of praises for Qiao Mianmian. Feeling uncomfortable, she walked towards Qiao Mianmian. She raised her chin and said, “Don’t put so much oil in the stir-fry tomorrow morning. I’m on a diet, I can’t eat too much oil.”

She sounded very confident.

It was as if Qiao Mianmian was supposed to cook for them.

Qiao Mianmian thought that since she was going to cook anyway, she might as well cook for everyone.

But just because she was willing to take care of her teammates didn’t mean that she should be the one doing it.

Especially when she met someone as confused as Song Ke. She found it funny. “Song Ke, I think you’ve made a mistake?”

Song Ke was stunned. “What did I get wrong?”

Qiao Mianmian looked at her and said calmly, “I have no obligation to cook for you. You have to be clear about this. The kitchen is for public use, everyone can use it. You can cook whatever you want.

“You don’t have to eat it if you don’t think the food is not to your liking. No one is forcing you to eat it. Since you’ve eaten it, don’t spout so many opinions. People who don’t do anything have no right to complain, understand?”
