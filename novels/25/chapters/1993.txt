Chapter 1995: Don’t Act So Familiar With Me in the Future

Mo Yesi recognized her.

When Madam Mo brought Tang Ya back to the Mo Residence for the first time, he felt that there was something wrong with her.

At that time, he paid more attention to her.

Hence, he recognized her.

But Tang Ya was a stranger to him, so he didn’t intend to greet her even if he recognized her.

Now that Tang Ya had introduced herself again, Mo Yesi simply nodded. “Miss Tang.”

He was about to enter the elevator and she called him again.

“Mr. Mo.”

“Miss Tang, is there anything else?” Mo Yesi sounded a little impatient.

“Mr. Mo, I just wanted to tell you that you should go back and visit Madam Mo when you’re free.” Tang Ya’s voice was soft and gentle, and she didn’t mind his coldness. “Madam Mo is always talking about you. She cares a lot about you. Mr. Mo, you don’t have to be angry with your mother.”

“My relationship with my mother is our family’s business. It has nothing to do with an outsider like you.”

In the face of Tang Ya’s kind persuasion, Mo Yesi was cold and said without giving her any face, “Miss Tang, it’s best you don’t get involved in other people’s family matters. Moreover, I’m not familiar with you, so it’s not appropriate for you to say this to me.”

Tang Ya’s calm expression cracked.

Her expression stiffened for a few seconds.

“Mr. Mo, I only meant well. Your mother and I are friends, so I can’t bear to see her depressed all day. If Mr. Mo thinks I’m being nosy, I won’t say it again.”

“You’re really nosy.” Mo Yesi narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “It’s good that you realize this. Don’t act so familiar with me in the future.”

With that, he turned and entered the elevator.

The elevator doors closed.

Tang Ya bit her lip and her expression darkened.

This Mo Yesi...

She took a deep breath and tried to suppress her anger. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

She had learned to control her emotions many years ago.

Few people could anger her anymore.

She thought that she was already good at managing her emotions.

But she was easily angered by Mo Yesi.

He didn’t behave normally.

No one else would have said that to her.

He didn’t show any mercy.

It seemed like the information she found out was accurate. Second Young Master Mo was cold and had a bad temper. He wasn’t someone who liked to play by the rules, so he was also a difficult person to deal with.

Tang Ya stood at the elevator with a dark expression for a while. Just as she turned around, another elevator stopped.

The woman in the elevator was stunned to see her. “Miss Tang.”

Tang Ya looked up and saw Shen Rou walking towards her. She said calmly, “Did you see anyone you know downstairs?”

“Someone I know?” Shen Rou was stunned. “Who?”

“Mo Yesi just went down. You didn’t see him?”

Shen Rou’s expression changed.

She shook her head.

Tang Ya turned around and said, “Let’s go.”

“Alright.” Shen Rou wasn’t as arrogant as before. She spoke very politely to Tang Ya. When Tang Ya said to leave, she immediately followed her.

They walked to a private room and entered it.
