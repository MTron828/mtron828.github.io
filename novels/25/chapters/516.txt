Chapter 517: How Could He Be So Heartless!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“He just left, actually. He was with you the entire time.” Lin Huizhen lied, attempting to make her feel better.

However, the truth was that Su Ze left after sending Qiao Anxin to the hospital, and he never came back.

When Lin Huizhen called him, he would make the excuse that he was busy and would only come to visit when he had the time.

But how busy could he be?

The Su Mandate wasn’t very far away from the hospital. At most, it would just take an hour for him to come for a visit.

It was impossible that he couldn’t spare an hour.

He must have not wanted to come.

Lin Huizhen thought that it was due to the fight the other day. However, she couldn’t ask Qiao Anxin as she had just woken up.

“Mom, stop lying to me,” Qiao Anxin said as her face remained pale. She clenched her fists and exclaimed, “He never visited at all, right? He only got together with me because of the child. Now that the child is gone, he wants to break up with me.”

Starting to tear up, she said, “How could he be so heartless! Mom, how could he...

“If it wasn’t for him, I wouldn’t have lost my child...”

“What, he’s breaking up with you?”

Father Qiao remained quiet during the entire conversion until he heard what Qiao Anxin said. He frowned and asked anxiously, “Anxin, what’s going on? Su Ze wanted to break up with you?”

Lin Huizhen frowned as well. “Yeah, he wanted to break up with you? Didn’t he love you and was planning to marry you?” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The couple was hoping that Qiao Anxin could quickly marry into the Su family to improve the situation of the Qiao family.

You could even say that Su Ze was their only hope.

If Su Ze were to break up with Qiao Anxin, how could they possibly improve their situation?

Hence, the couple got anxious after hearing that Su Ze wanted to break up with her.

Qiao Anxin was feeling dejected and angry from the recent events from having the miscarriage to Su Ze wanting to break up with her. Hence, she was seeking some form of comfort and warmth from her parents.

However, her parents were more concerned with Su Ze breaking up with her than her feelings.

They were afraid that Su Ze was going to break up with her.

They were afraid that the Qiao family would lose this connection with the Su family.

It felt as though her life was nothing compared to the benefits of linking up with the Su family.

Qiao Anxin was so frustrated that she shivered. She shook off her mom’s hand and exclaimed, “Dad, mom, I’ve lost my child. Your grandchild was killed by Su Ze. Why are you not angry with him?

“He has mistreated your daughter. Aren’t you going to seek justice for me?”

“Anxin, I’m sure he didn’t do it on purpose.” Lin Huizhen quickly comforted her, worried that her daughter’s anger would lead to rashness. “You’re carrying his child. Even a monster wouldn’t hurt its own children, how would he want to harm his own child?

“He was willing to marry you because of the child. It shows how important the child was to him.

“Tell me what happened between the both of you. I’ll help you to decide who was in the right.”

Qiao Anxin’s eyes welled in tears. She wanted to say what happened. But as she recalled what happened before she lost consciousness, she kept quiet again.

She couldn’t say it.

If she did, she would be in the wrong.

Furthermore, Su Ze didn’t do it intentionally as well.
