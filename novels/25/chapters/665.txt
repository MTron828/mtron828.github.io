Chapter 667: You Can Tell Me, I’ll Help You Settle It

She laughed out of anger. “Very good, Miss Qiao. I hope Director Bai’s interest will only continue to grow. Otherwise... Hmph...”

She probably had to maintain her image with Tu Yilei around, so she scoffed and turned to leave.

“I’m sorry, Sister Mianmian.”

After Huang Yilin left, Nana said worriedly, “It’s all my fault. I caused you trouble.

“What do we do, Huang Yilin seems really angry. Will she come after you on purpose in the future?

“Sister Mianmian, I’m really sorry for causing you so much trouble.”

Nana was almost in tears.

Qiao Mianmian patted her on the shoulder and comforted her. “It has nothing to do with you, you don’t have to blame yourself. Even if you didn’t say that, she’d still find trouble with me.”

The fuse was Bai Yusheng.

Hence, it didn’t matter whether or not Nala said anything.

From the moment Bai Yusheng gave her his number, Huang Yilin would never let her off.

“But...” Nana still felt guilty.

She’d only been Qiao Mianmian’s assistant for less than a day, and she’d already caused so much trouble.

She offended the female lead on the first day of filming.

The next three months would definitely be tough.

Huang Yilin was afraid of Director Bai and her image, so she wouldn’t dare to do anything openly.

But who knew what she would do behind her back?

Given Huang Yilin’s current status, it was too easy for her to deal with a newbie.

“Nana, this really has nothing to do with you.” Qiao Mianmian sighed. “Can’t you tell that it’s because of Bai Yusheng...”

She suddenly realized that Tu Yilei hadn’t left.

He was still standing there, looking at her with a half-smile.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“Mr. Tu, w-why are you still here?”

Tu Yilei looked at her shocked expression and smiled. “I’m here, did I scare you? If you need me to leave, I’ll...”

“No, no.”

Qiao Mianmian shook her head. “That’s not what I meant. I thought you left with Senior Huang.”

Tu Yilei raised an eyebrow. “Why should I go with her?”

“Uh...” Qiao Mianmian raised an eyebrow. “Aren’t you good friends?”

Tu Yilei frowned. “Who told you that we’re good friends?”

“Aren’t you?”

She heard Huang Yilin call him Yilei, and it sounded rather intimate.

They seemed to be on good terms.

But Tu Yilei’s reaction was different from what she’d expected.

“No,” Tu Yilei replied without hesitation. “I’ve worked with her in a show before. We’re just friends.”

“Oh.”

She felt that Tu Yilei didn’t need to explain himself.

No matter what his relationship with Huang Yilin was, it had nothing to do with her.

“Don’t take her words to heart. She does have that sort of intention towards Director Bai, so she’s always suspected that other actresses are trying to steal him from her. What I said to her just now wasn’t entirely a lie.”

Qiao Mianmian blinked.

Tu Yilei looked at her with his bright eyes. “If she finds trouble with you in the future, you can tell me. I’ll help you settle it. I’ll take care of you.”
