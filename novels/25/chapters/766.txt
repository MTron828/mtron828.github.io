But now...

Although Bai Yusheng asked casually, Qiao Mianmian thought seriously for a while before replying, “I feel that the female lead role isn’t suitable for me. I’m more suitable for the third female role.”

Everyone wanted to be the female lead.

Qiao Mianmian was the same.

But because she’d read the original novel, she knew that the female lead role wasn’t suitable for her.

She didn’t look like the female lead.

In the original novel, the female lead was described as a charming and beautiful woman.

Huang Yilin’s appearance was very fitting.

And her looks had nothing to do with beauty.

This was secondary.

It was mainly because she felt that her acting skills still needed to improve. It might not be a problem for her to be the third female lead, but as for the female lead...

She wasn’t confident.

The female lead in the original novel was particularly challenging to act.

As a newbie who hadn’t properly acted in a drama before, it was rather difficult for her to get the female lead role.

Qiao Mianmian knew herself.

Hence, even though she knew that she might miss a good opportunity, she still followed her heart.

If she wasn’t suitable, she wasn’t.

Bai Yusheng raised his brows and looked a little surprised.

It was as if he hadn’t expected such an answer.

Did she know what her answer meant?

“You really think so?”

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian nodded. “Everyone wants the female lead role, but not everyone is suitable for it. I feel that my acting skills are still improving, it’s better to train a little more.”

“What if I told you to be the female lead?” This was Bai Yusheng’s first time meeting an actress like Qiao Mianmian.

If it was any other actor, they would definitely fight for it.

Very few people could resist such temptation.

“Brother Bai, did Mo Yesi say something to you?”

Huang Yilin was covered in dirt now, and Mo Yesi probably wouldn’t let her get up again.

Bai Yusheng probably knew about this too.

Hence, the female lead had to be replaced.

Qiao Mianmian felt that Bai Yusheng must have said something to her. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

For example, asking him to give her the female lead role.

But Bai Yusheng shook his head and said, “He didn’t say anything to me. I’m the one who wants to know. You know about Huang Yilin. Mo Yesi either doesn’t do anything, or he won’t let her off.

“I lost my female lead, so I have to find another one.

“Mianmian, you really don’t want to take the female lead role?”

Qiao Mianmian hesitated for a while before blinking. “Brother Bai, can I tell you the truth?”

Bai Yusheng nodded. “Mm, go ahead.”

“Uh, I actually want to be the female lead.” She touched her nose in embarrassment and blushed. “But I’m worried that I won’t be able to act well. Moreover, I don’t think I look like the female lead.”

Hence, she didn’t really want to reject him!

Her heart ached when she rejected him.

“So, you still want the female lead role?” Bai Yusheng asked directly.

Qiao Mianmian hesitated for a while before nodding.

She didn’t want to lie to him.
