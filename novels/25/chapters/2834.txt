Chapter 2837: You Have Another Chance

“What I said is true. He did find a substitute to stay by his side. I’m not the only one who knows about this. Many people in the Gong Corporation know about it.

“Why? Did your seduction plan fail? Gong Zeli isn’t interested in you at all? Qiao Anxin, I’ve told you before, he’s not a man you can get easily.

“If you treat him like an ordinary man and think that you can easily make him fall head over heels for you, you’re completely wrong.”

Qiao Anxin’s face paled and she felt embarrassed. She gritted her teeth and said, “Didn’t you say that I’m more like Qiao Mianmian than the substitute? Since he can keep that woman by his side, why doesn’t he show any reaction when he saw me?”

“He didn’t react to you at all?” Su Ze seemed surprised.

“Not only did he not respond, but he also said that he wasn’t interested in me. He even got someone to chase me out of his private room.” Qiao Anxin didn’t say that she’d been kicked by Gong Zeli and thrown out. It was too embarrassing.

“Could it be that he’s not interested in Qiao Mianmian at all? Did we guess wrongly? Otherwise, why wouldn’t he be interested in me at all?”

“Impossible,” Su Ze said firmly. “It’s impossible that he isn’t interested in Qiao Mianmian. If he wasn’t, he wouldn’t have helped her again and again, nor would he have found a substitute to keep by his side. He also wouldn’t have lost his brotherhood with Mo Yesi.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Then, why did he say that he’s not interested in me? And I can feel that he… really isn’t interested in me. It’s not an act.” Qiao Anxin bit her lip.

Su Ze kept quiet for a while.

“I don’t know. But are you planning to give up just like that?”

“Of course not.” Qiao Anxin immediately said, “That’s why I called you. Su Ze, you have to help me. Do you think… he’s not interested in me because he already has a substitute?

“What kind of woman is she? Could it be that the substitute is a vixen and Gong Zeli is charmed by her?

“Su Ze, say something. Is the substitute a vixen?”

“What’s the rush?” Under her urging, Su Ze slowly said, “That substitute is a female university student. I’ve seen her once, and she looks like an insensible little girl. Gong Zeli treats her well, but he definitely won’t be charmed by such a little girl.

“As for why he’s not interested in you, that’s up to you to discover.”

Qiao Anxin was stunned. “Su Ze, what do you mean?”

“Didn’t you tell me confidently that you’d definitely be able to take him down tonight? Qiao Anxin, I’ve said it before, Gong Zeli isn’t an ordinary man. If you want to use your previous method of seducing men to deal with him, then don’t waste your efforts.

“Think about it carefully. You still have one more chance. If Gong Zeli isn’t interested in your face, then your face is wasted. Then, our cooperation will end here.” Su Ze hung up.

Qiao Anxin stood by the street and gripped her cell phone tightly.

No.

She definitely wouldn’t let plastic surgery be for nothing.
