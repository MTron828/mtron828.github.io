Chapter 129: I’m Not Leaving Tonight

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“It’s not ideal, but it’s alright. Just make do with it for now.”

“Make do? It’s great!” Jiang Luoli moved her luggage into the slightly smaller bedroom and said cheekily, “I’ll unpack my luggage in my room, then I’ll take a shower and go to bed. I won’t be leaving my room for the rest of the night. So, Baby... you and Prince Charming can do whatever you want. Just take it that I’m not around.”

With that, she went into her bedroom and closed the door.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Jiang Luoli was being mean!

What did she mean by “do whatever you want”!

She didn’t want to do anything at all.

But the man beside her chuckled alluringly. “She’s so sensible and considerate.”

Qiao Mianmian looked up and bit her lip. “Ignore what she said.”

Mo Yesi looked at her with a strange expression.

Qiao Mianmian blushed.

She frantically took a deep breath and gently pushed him away, grabbing the luggage from him. “I’ll unpack my stuff too.”

With that, she dragged it into the bedroom.

Seeing how desperate she was to escape, Mo Yesi smiled and followed behind her slowly.

He did not have to rush.

Good things were worth waiting for, anyway.

...

Qiao Mianmian saw a huge bed in the middle of the bedroom the moment she entered.

This was considered the “master bedroom”, so it was slightly bigger in floor area than the other bedroom. The bed was a two-person bed.

On that thought, her heart began pounding rapidly.

Seeing her stare at the huge bed, Mo Yesi laughed and hugged her from behind.

The man’s arms were strong and firm, holding her tightly.

With her back against his warm body, Qiao Mianmian felt her mind was in a mess.

“Baby...” Mo Yesi whispered in her ear. “I’m not leaving tonight. I’ll stay over for the night, alright?”

Her previous room was a six-bedder.

Hence, it was rather inconvenient.

But this dormitory was a two-bedder and she even had her own room. Mo Yesi obviously wouldn’t leave his pretty wife behind to return to an empty bed.

Qiao Mianmian’s heart pumped so quickly. “No, you can’t. Our school doesn’t allow visitors to stay over.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

She got flustered upon hearing him say that.

Although they had slept on the same bed before, that happened only after she had already fallen asleep and had no idea about it.

Now, to be fully conscious and sharing a bed with him...

The thought alone embarrassed her enough.

She didn’t feel ready.

Nor had she fully accepted this new husband of hers.

“Yes, I can. Because I say so.”

His warm breath against her ear brought about her goosebumps.

His hoarse voice went on, “Baby, let me stay. Don’t be afraid, I won’t do anything to you. I promised I’d give you a week to adapt to it, so I won’t break that promise. I just want to hug you to sleep. It’s only with you that I won’t lose sleep.”
