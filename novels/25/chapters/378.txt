Chapter 381: He Was Probably Very Generous Too

“I know how long I have known Shen Rou for. I don’t need you to remind me of that.” Mo Yesi said expressionlessly, “My attitude towards her has nothing to do with how long I’ve known her for. If she felt embarrassed that day, she asked for it.”

“Mo Yesi, you...”

“I haven’t changed, the problem lies with you.” Mo Yesi looked at him matter-of-factly. “You know very well why things have turned out like this. Also, my wife is somebody I will protect for life. Anyone that makes her upset is finding trouble with me.”

Qiao Mianmian was so touched, she squeezed his hand tightly.

This man did as he promised.

He’d told her that he wouldn’t let anyone make her feel upset or aggrieved.

And he’d chosen to stand on her side even when they were facing his friend of over 10 years.

He hadn’t ignored this issue simply because Gong Zeli was his buddy.

Not everyone was able to handle things this way.

In fact, most men wouldn’t be able to.

To many of them, their buddies were way more important than their women.

Gong Zeli was furious at his stubbornness. “... Alright. I’ll see how long you can protect her for. Mo Yesi, you’ll regret it one day!”

With that, Gong Zeli stormed out.

Before leaving, he shot Qiao Mianmian another glare, but this time, there was a strange emotion in his eyes. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Mo Yesi rubbed his temple. He seemed a little tired.

“Are you alright?” Qiao Mianmian felt bad.

Mo Yesi always ended up in conflict with Gong Zeli because of her.

They used to be such good friends.

But now...

She could tell that Mo Yesi was also affected after his argument with Gong Zeli and Shen Rou.

He didn’t voice it explicitly, but how could he really be completely alright?

She thought about it. If she and Jiang Luoli strained their relationship someday, she’d be devastated too.

But she’d never do something so silly.

When Luo Luo found a guy in the future, she surely wouldn’t voice her opinion against him, unless he was an obviously terrible choice.

“I’m fine.” Mo Yesi looked down at her and smiled. “It’s just a minor incident, don’t bother about it. Which bag caught your eye just now? Have they wrapped it up for you yet?”

“Mister, this is the bag.”

The employee was afraid they wouldn’t want it anymore, and that none of the bags would have been sold out by the end of this incident. She quickly walked over with the bag. “This lady took an interest in this black bag first. But Young Master Gong’s companion liked this one as well, so this lady let her have it.

“Actually, all three colors of this design are nice. The black one is classic, the wine red one has a Western-style to it, and the jade green one is vintage and elegant. All three of them are great as accessories.”

They had no idea who Mo Yesi was.

But given how Gong Zeli seemed to be close to him...

He must be a big shot too.

Moreover, it seemed like he really doted on the female customer he was with. He was probably very generous too.

They were hoping to have him get all three bags at once.

Mo Yesi didn’t know much about ladies’ bags, but he was still able to tell which looked good and which didn’t.
