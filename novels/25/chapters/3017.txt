Chapter 3018 The End (1)

She’d thought that no matter if it was a boy or a girl, she’d only have one child.

It was the same with Mo Yesi. Both of them decided to have only one child.

But now, she was thinking of having another.

However, she felt that Mo Yesi might not agree to it. He didn’t seem to be interested in having a child. To him, this was just a task. Once it was completed, he didn’t want another one.

It seemed like she had to persuade him.

The nurse carried the baby to the other family members and washed it.

Old Madam was so happy that she couldn’t close her mouth. She held Mother Bai’s hand and praised her non-stop. “This child is so beautiful. His eyes, nose, and mouth are exactly the same as Yesi’s when he was young. No, he’s much prettier than Yesi when he was young.

“His skin is fair and tender, and his hair is dark green. He inherited Mianmian’s good points.

“The ears look a little like yours, in-law. The earlobes are big and thick. It’s obvious that the baby’s blessed.”

Mother Bai also smiled. Hearing Old Madam say that the baby’s ears resembled hers, she was instantly excited. “Really? Old Madam, do you really think that the baby’s ears resemble mine?”

Old Madam nodded. She was rather agitated. “Yes, I think so.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

This made Mother Bai extremely happy. She grabbed Father Bai’s hand and said excitedly, “Did you hear that? Old Madam said that our precious grandchild’s ears look like mine. Actually, I think so too. My mom said that my ears are good since I was young. The fortune-teller looked at my ears and said that if I were a man, I would definitely be a high-ranking official in the future.

“But I’m a woman, so I can’t be a high-ranking official. But our precious grandson can be a high-ranking official in the future.”

Father Bai was rather happy, too. Although he didn’t believe in such superstitions, he wouldn’t say anything to ruin the atmosphere at such a joyous time.

He nodded. “You’re right.”

At this moment, Mother Bai’s cell phone rang.

It was Bai Yusheng.

Bai Yusheng was filming a movie overseas and couldn’t rush back in time. He could only call Mother Bai to ask about Qiao Mianmian.

Mother Bai was full of joy. “Your sister has given birth. The baby was just born. The nurse has gone to wash him now.

“It’s a little boy. He’s so handsome. He’s even more handsome than you were when you were young “Name? Not yet. Let your sister and brother-in-law decide the baby’s name. After all, it’s their child.

“Don’t worry, the mother and son are safe. Mm, be careful with Sheng Sheng. When the time comes, take a taxi to the hospital. We won’t pick you up. We still have to take care of your sister.”

After a few more words, Mother Bai hung up.

She turned around and said to Father Bai, “Yusheng and Sheng Sheng are on their way back. Now that my first grandson is settled, I’m looking forward to having another grandson soon. Sigh, I wonder when they’ll get married. In a few months, Yusheng will be 33 years old.

“He’s almost 40, but his marriage is still nowhere to be seen. As parents, how can we not worry?”

Bai Yusheng and Gu Sheng had been together for almost a year.

Father Bai and Mother Bai were very satisfied with Gu Sheng, their future daughter-in-law. They hoped that they could get married and have children soon.
