Chapter 2313: No Woman Is Worthy of Him

Lu Rao looked at Yan Shaoqing’s indignant expression and shook his head.

“Second Cousin, is Brother Yesi here?” A sweet voice sounded from behind Yan Shaoqing.

He turned around and looked at the girl behind him.

The person who spoke was his cousin, Lin Wanwan. She was 16 this year and came to his house for winter vacation.

The girl was pretty and young, like a budding flower.

Yan Shaoqing had several cousins, and this one was his favorite.

Deep down, he was a lolicon and liked lolitas.

Hence, he liked this cute cousin of his.

This was why he brought her along.

“Mm, it’s him.” Yan Shaoqing smiled. “You still remember him.”

Lin Wanwan kept quiet for a while. She recalled some scenes and nodded shyly. “Mm, I remember.”

“You only saw him once, and you were very young then. I remember that you were less than 10 years old. Do you remember what he looked like?”

Lin Wanwan nodded again and looked at the slender figure in front of Yan Shaoqing. She pursed her lips and said shyly, “Mm, I remember. Brother Yesi is such an outstanding person. Even if we only met once, he left a deep impression on me.”

Yan Shaoqing smiled. “That’s true. Any girl would have a deep impression of my Second Bro’s face. Sigh, you girls, regardless of age, like good-looking people.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

As a man, Yan Shaoqing was also very impressed by Mo Yesi’s looks.

His second brother’s looks were the sort that men and women would find handsome.

Not to mention a woman, even he would stare at Second Bro’s face in a daze, wondering how a man could be so good-looking.

He would like him too if he was a woman.

Lin Wanwan pursed her lips and kept quiet.

She had a deep impression of Mo Yesi from the first time they met.

After that, she’d never seen anyone better looking than him.

Even the most outstanding man around her couldn’t compare to him.

At that time, Lin Wanwan had a bold idea.

She thought that when she grew up and could talk about marriage, she would fight for herself.

Unfortunately…

The Prince Charming she’d been secretly in love with for so many years got married before she even got the chance to fight for him.

Lin Wanwan felt uncomfortable at the thought of this.

Her Prince Charming was the most perfect man in the world.

No woman was worthy of him.

She wanted to see what the woman who snatched her Prince Charming looked like.

It was a pity that she was blocked by Yan Shaoqing.

“Second Cousin, is the lady beside Brother Yesi his wife?” Lin Wanwan asked tentatively.

“Mm.” Yan Shaoqing recalled his cousin’s temper and couldn’t help but say, “Oh, right. Wanwan, come and see Sis-in-law quickly. This is your first time meeting her, don’t be rude and let others say that our Yan family’s girls are uneducated.”

Lin Wanwan and her best friend stood up to see what Qiao Mianmian looked like.
