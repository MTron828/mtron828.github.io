Chapter 1278: Sister Is Really Good at Coaxing People

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Steady, don’t give yourself away.” Shen Rou’s cold voice was heard. “Even if he suspects something, he won’t be able to find anything. That blood is real, and the test results are real. So what if he suspects something?

“At most, we can do another paternity test. We still have Qiao Mianmian’s blood, what are you afraid of?”

“But...” Qiao Anxin felt that things weren’t as simple as Shen Rou said.

Madam Bai was easy to get rid of.

But Bai Yusheng...

“If he really found out something, would you still be in the Bai family now? Qiao Anxin, don’t be so suspicious anymore. If you continue like this, even if they don’t suspect you, they’ll think there’s something wrong with you.

“Remember, you’re the daughter of the Bai family now. Your identity has been confirmed.”

Qiao Anxin’s anxious heart slowly calmed down.

But she was still afraid.

“Since they can’t find anything, why are they still so good to that slut Qiao Mianmian? I’m the biological daughter of the Bai family, right? But whether it’s Madam Bai or Bai Yusheng, they’re much better to that slut than to me.”

She gritted her teeth. “I really don’t know what that slut fed them.”

“Qiao Mianmian’s methods are much better than yours.” Shen Rou sneered. “If you had her scheming methods, you could do the same. Alright, let’s not talk about her anymore. Qiao Anxin, I’ve helped you get to where you are now. Shouldn’t you repay me?”

Qiao Anxin was stunned. “Miss Shen, what do you want me to do?”

“You’ve been separated from the Bai family for more than 10 years, and now you’ve finally been acknowledged. I believe the Bai family owes you now. No matter what request you make, they’ll agree to it. I want you to tell Madam Bai to fork out a sum of money to invest in the Shen Corporation.

“Qiao Anxin, remember, I can let you get your current position, but I can also make you return to your original state. So, the investment has to be settled today. I don’t care what method you use, you have to get the investment.”

Qiao Anxin’s expression darkened.

She didn’t know if Madam Bai and Bai Yusheng were suspecting her.

But Shen Rou wanted her to get her money.

If Madam Bai and Bai Yusheng suspected her even more because of this, what should she do?

But Shen Rou...

Just as she was getting frustrated, someone knocked on the door.

Qiao Anxin was shocked and looked towards the door.

“Miss, Madam wants you to go down for dinner.” A maid’s voice sounded from outside.

Qiao Anxin calmed down and looked at her cell phone. She recalled what Shen Rou said to her just now and took a deep breath. “I got it. Tell Mom, I’ll go down immediately.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Qiao Anxin saw Madam Bai sitting in the living room.

Qiao Mianmian was sitting beside Madam Bai, and they were talking about something. Madam Bai smiled happily.

She couldn’t help but feel angry.

She clenched her fists and walked over.

“Mom.” She looked at Qiao Mianmian unhappily and couldn’t help but say sourly, “Sister is really good at coaxing people. It seems like Mom really likes Sister.”

After confirming that Qiao Anxin was an impostor, Madam Bai no longer treated her gently.
