Chapter 39: Handsome, Can We Talk?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Really?” Qiao Anxin hated how indifferent and carefree she was. She gritted her teeth and threatened. “Try it, then. Qiao Mianmian, don’t you like to run after sugar daddies? Then try doing that for a lifetime.

“I’d like to see how powerful the gold lord behind you can be. See if he can make you famous!”

The Su family in Yuncheng wasn’t so powerful to control everything.

But the power of the Su family was definitely more than several rich families.

So what if Qiao Mianmian had a rich sugar daddy now?

No matter how powerful her master was, he couldn’t be more powerful than Brother Ah Ze.

Looking at her arrogance, Qiao Mianmian only thought of it as a joke. She pursed her lips and said lightly, “Okay, I will. I also want to see how famous Su Ze can make you.”

She wasn’t someone who would initiate a challenge.

But she wouldn’t be afraid if someone challenged her.

After saying this, she reached out to push Qiao Anxin away and walked past her. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Qiao Anxin watched her back as she left, bit her lips tight, and yelled angrily, “Qiao Mianmian, you will come back and beg me. I’ll wait!”

Qiao Mianmian walked straight out of the bathroom without making any response.

As soon as she walked out, she saw a familiar figure standing against the wall as if waiting for someone.

The man was 1.88 meters tall, with long straight legs. He had one hand in his black suit pants pocket and was standing lazily.

He lowered his head, his forehead plummeting a little. His tall nose and cold jawline were very sexy, his tight thin lips were a touch of water-red, and his lips were full and moist, looking extremely seductive.

Even if he lowered his head and his entire face couldn’t be seen, the exposed outline of his face was enough to attract people.

The women passing by watched him secretly.

They all blushed and giggled with red faces.

A bold woman walked up to him, blushed, and looked up at him with a shameful expression. “Handsome guy, can we get to know each other?”

Mo Yesi lifted his eyes, his gaze and voice showing alienation even a thousand miles away. “No.”

Qiao Mianmian went quiet.

She felt embarrassed as she saw the pretty woman’s face flush red instantly.

She knew that a man like Mo Yesi would attract the attention of the opposite sex wherever he went.

He looked good, had a good temperament, and was first-rate. He was the so-called “walking male hormone.”

It was normal for women to want to talk to him.

However, seeing how he had rejected a woman so indifferently after being approached, Qiao Mianmian felt like her newly appointed husband was really harsh when cutting someone off.

Even if it was a great beauty, he refused her directly and indifferently, without giving her face.

In comparison, Qiao Mianmian suddenly discovered that Mo Yesi’s attitude towards her was much better.

The woman whom he had refused was stunned and embarrassed for a moment. Then, she asked relentlessly, “Why?”

Qiao Mianmian blinked and leaned forward, wanting to hear his answer.

She saw Mo Yesi raise his head suddenly. The man’s deep and charming eyes glanced in her direction.

The moment their eyes met, Qiao Mianmian froze.
