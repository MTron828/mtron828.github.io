Chapter 875: She Didn’t Have Good Intentions

Qiao Mianmian was very good at acting and had a high level of understanding. But she was still a newcomer, and her acting skills were still lacking.

Tu Yilei would point out her flaws and teach her how to perform better.

After a few scenes, Qiao Mianmian felt that the previous night wasn’t too smooth, but now she could perform smoothly and naturally.

Moreover, Tu Yilei’s suggestions were very useful.

She had learned a lot from these scenes.

When it was over, she thanked him sincerely. “Senior Tu, thank you. I thought that there were two places where the scenes were stopped last night, but I didn’t know how to perform them. Your suggestions were very useful to me.”

Tu Yilei looked at her with his bright and clear eyes and smiled gently. “That’s because you’re originally smart and have a high level of understanding. Otherwise, it’s useless no matter what I say. Speaking of which, I should thank you too. After watching the show with you, I have a lot more confidence in today’s shoot.”

“Can I still look for you for scenes in the future?” Tu Yilei clenched his fists as he said this. There was a hint of nervousness and anticipation in his eyes.

Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and nodded. “Mm, sure.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Tu Yilei smiled. “Alright, you can look for me if you have any scenes in the future. Miss Qiao, can I ask you a question?”

“What?”

“Are you really Director Bai’s cousin?” Tu Yilei was rather curious about this. He didn’t believe it completely as others did. He still had some doubts.

Qiao Mianmian had already discussed it with Bai Yusheng last night, so she hesitated for a few seconds before nodding. “Mm, he’s my cousin. Why?”

Tu Yilei’s eyes were filled with curiosity. After a moment of silence, he smiled and said, “Nothing much, I’m just surprised. But you and Director Bai do look alike.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned.

Previously, Nana said that she looked like Bai Yusheng, and now Tu Yilei said the same...

Qiao Mianmian hadn’t noticed it herself.

Was she really like Bai Yusheng?

She couldn’t help but ask, “Do you think I look like Brother Bai?”

Tu Yilei glanced at her again, his heart racing. He quickly looked away and said, “Mm, your eyes and nose are quite similar.”

“Brother Tu, Miss Qiao.”

At this moment, Tu Yilei’s assistant walked over. He first glanced at Qiao Mianmian before whispering into Tu Yilei’s ear.

Tu Yilei frowned.

He said to his assistant, “I got it, I’ll be right there.”

After the assistant left, Tu Yilei looked at Qiao Mianmian worriedly. “You... can stay here for a while. Don’t go over for now.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned. “Why?”

Tu Yilei frowned again. “Huang Yilin is here. She said she’s looking for you. She’s up to no good. If you go and see her now, I’m afraid she’ll do something bad to you.”

Tu Yilei had a lot of dirt on Huang Yilin.

Back then, he’d threatened her that if she caused trouble for Qiao Mianmian again, he’d release the dirt.

But not long after he threatened her, he realized that someone had already released all sorts of scandals about her.
