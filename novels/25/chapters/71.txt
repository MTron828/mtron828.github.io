Chapter 72: The Men You Look for Are Increasingly Impressive

“Huh? Oh, I- I am.” Jiang Luoli was stunned for a few seconds before she realized that Mo Yesi was talking to her.

Mo Yesi smiled and said softly, “Mianmian is injured, so I will bring her to the hospital to take a look. She might return to school later in the afternoon, but if she’s late, you can help her take a leave.”

“Oh, okay, okay.” Jiang Luoli stared at Mo Yesi’s unbelievably handsome face and stuttered nervously. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

She was completely different from her usual carefree and masculine persona.

She even blushed.

Seeing this, Qiao Mianmian sighed and felt amazed at Mo Yesi’s lethal charisma.

When else did she ever see Jiang Luoli blush while talking to a boy?

Mo Yesi smiled again. “Sorry for the trouble.”

Jiang Luoli blushed even harder and appeared mesmerized by his smile. “No, no problem. You’re... you’re welcome.”

Mo Yesi glanced at the two other girls in the same bedroom as Mianmian and said, “Today is a special situation, but I will invite you to dinner another day.”

After saying this, he turned and left while carrying Qiao Mianmian.

Just minutes after Mo Yesi left, a group of police came.

Then, on the charge of disorderly behavior, Du Ze and the men he brought over were all arrested by a few officers. Shen Yueyue and Zhao Wanting were also taken away in tears by them.

In an instant, the place was quiet.

It was as if nothing had happened.

But anyone who had witnessed the whole process knew what happened.

“Who was that man? He looked so powerful.”

“Shen Yueyue thought that after Qiao Mianmian broke up with Su Ze, she wouldn’t have anyone to rely on. This time, she has shot herself in the foot.”

“I bow down only to Qiao Mianmian in terms of the ability to find men. The men she finds are increasingly impressive. She deserves my admiration.”

Qiao Mianmian struggled several times while being carried downstairs by Mo Yesi, but he still refused to put her down.

He calmly walked across the campus while carrying her.

They received countless curious eyes on the way.

Qiao Mianmian was so embarrassed that she buried her head deep in his arms to cover her face.

The man’s black shirt smelled nice and his fragrance surrounded her.

It was full of a tempting hormonal scent.

Her ears were placed at his heart and she could clearly hear his strong heartbeat.

It beat as if hitting her chest, causing her heartbeat to accelerate without restraint as well.

They reached the parking lot.

Uncle Li greeted them respectfully. “Young Master, Madam.”

Then, he bent down and opened the door of the back seat.

Mo Yesi carried her in.

Once he sat down and the door closed, he cradled Qiao Mianmian in his embrace and enveloped her body.

“Mo Yesi, you...” Qiao Mianmian wanted him to let her go.

As soon as she opened her mouth, the man’s hot kiss landed on her without warning.

He kissed her overbearingly and eagerly, snatching away her breath as her body softened in his arms.

Uncle Li got in the car.

When he saw the scene through the rearview mirror, his old face couldn’t help but blush again, and he quickly opened the shutter.

Uncle Li started the car and thought that according to this rate of progress, the Mo family would soon have a young master or a young lady.
