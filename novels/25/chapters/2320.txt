Chapter 2322: It Made Her Feel Warm

“See, he only has eyes for you now. We’re all air to him.”

“Yan Shaoqing, shut up.” Mo Yesi glared at him and threatened, “If you don’t speak, no one will think you’re mute.”

Yan Shaoqing rubbed his nose and shrugged. “Isn’t that the case?”

He turned around and sought Lu Rao’s approval. “Old Lu, am I right?”

Lu Rao glanced at him and smiled.

Qiao Mianmian was a little embarrassed by Yan Shaoqing’s teasing.

She felt that he was exaggerating.

He liked to joke around with her and Mo Yesi.

Hence, she ignored him and asked, “Where’s my brother? Shaoqing, didn’t you say that my brother was here too?”

She didn’t see Bai Yusheng.

Unexpectedly, Yan Shaoqing also looked puzzled. “I also want to know where he went.”

“What do you mean?” Qiao Mianmian frowned.

“Your brother went to the washroom half an hour ago and still hasn’t returned. I’m worried that he fell into a trap.”

Qiao Mianmian frowned again.

Mo Yesi led her to the sofa and smiled. “What’s there to worry about? Your brother isn’t a child. If you’re really worried, you can just send him a message or call him.”

“Oh, right.” Qiao Mianmian knocked her head lightly and immediately took out her cell phone.

Then, she sent Bai Yusheng a WeChat message: [Brother, Ah Si and I arrived at Nightlight, but I don’t see you. Where are you?]

She waited for about a minute before he replied.

Bai Yusheng: [I have something on, I’ll come over later. You guys play first.]

Qiao Mianmian felt relieved after receiving his message.

Mo Yesi sat her down and whispered into her ear, “If you want to go home, let me know. We can go back anytime.”

He knew that Qiao Mianmian didn’t like such events. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Mm, I know.” His thoughtfulness warmed Qiao Mianmian’s heart.

No matter what, he always valued her feelings and prioritized her.

That alone warmed her.

Marrying a man like Mo Yesi was really blissful.

…

Lin Wanwan’s gaze landed on the two figures leaning against each other intimately. She couldn’t help but feel bitter.

She snorted and bit her lip, then said sourly, “Some people are really good at acting. They actually want to drink yogurt in such a place. They’re too f**king pure.”

She didn’t dare to say it too loudly. Only her best friend, Xiaoyu, could hear her.

Xiaoyu was stunned.

Although Lin Wanwan was also hostile towards Qiao Mianmian, she didn’t show it too obviously.

But now, it was obvious.

Her eyes, face, and even her words showed how unhappy she was with Qiao Mianmian.

Xiaoyu hesitated for a while before asking, “Wanwan, you… don’t like Sister Mianmian?”

She liked Qiao Mianmian.

She was pretty and had a good personality.

She was like a big sister next door.

“No.” Lin Wanwan didn’t hide her disgust towards Qiao Mianmian. “I hate women who like to pretend to be innocent. She’s a green tea b*tch.”
