Chapter 2538: Do You Have Any Objections?

“She said that you felt aggrieved and wanted to defend her. So, she was lying.

“How could she do this? Shen Xin, you’re sisters from the same parents, right? Is your sister using you as a shield?”

A few minutes later.

Shen Xin hung up.

Her face was a little pale as she hurriedly opened the Weibo account that she hadn’t logged in for a long time.

Soon, she saw Shen Rou’s post.

Her fingers trembled as she clicked on the video. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Shen Rou’s heartbroken cries entered her ears. “Xiao Xin is still young. That’s why she made a mistake on impulse.”

“Xiao Xin did it for me. Even if she did everything, I’m still responsible.

“Don’t scold Xiao Xin, scold me.

“I apologize on Xiao Xin’s behalf. I’m sorry, I didn’t discipline my sister well.

“Xiao Xin told me once that she wanted to stand up for me. I didn’t mind it at that time and thought that she was just joking. I didn’t expect her to really do those things behind my back. If I’d known she would do that, I would have stopped her.”

The video lasted about 10 minutes.

Shen Xin only looked at it for two minutes before turning it off.

She didn’t know what else Shen Rou said.

She didn’t want to know anymore.

Shen Xin had always known that Shen Rou didn’t have deep feelings for her.

But she thought that even if Shen Rou didn’t have such deep feelings for her, they were sisters who grew up together.

Their relationship was definitely better than strangers.

But at this moment, she realized that she was wrong.

Their sisterhood was just her wishful thinking.

It turned out that in Shen Rou’s heart, this sister of hers was just a chess piece that could take the bullet for her anytime.

Shen Rou hadn’t discussed this with her beforehand.

She didn’t ask for her opinion and whether she was willing to be a scapegoat.

Perhaps her decision wasn’t important.

Shen Xin was stunned for a while before calling Shen Rou.

It rang for a long time before Shen Rou picked up.

“Sister.”

Shen Xin called softly.

“Xiao Xin, did you see it all?” Shen Rou asked coldly.

Shen Xin didn’t understand why Shen Rou could still speak to her so coldly.

She was the one who did something wrong.

“Sister, why?” Shen Xin bit her lip and choked. “Why did you do that?”

“Shen Xin, what’s with your tone?” Shen Rou seemed to be angry from embarrassment. “Are you here to question me? You’re my sister, so what’s wrong with blocking some things for me? Don’t forget, the food you eat and the clothes you’re wearing now, which of them wasn’t given to you by the Shen family?

“If I hadn’t found a way to get our Shen family through this crisis, would you still be living your current life?

“Would you still be going to such a good university?

“You might be begging on the streets now!

“As a member of the Shen family, what’s wrong with doing something for the family? Do you have any objections?”

“Sister, no, I…” Shen Xin’s eyes reddened. “Why didn’t you discuss it with me beforehand? I have the right to know, right?”
