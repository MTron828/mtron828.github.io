Chapter 2292: I Almost Fainted

If it wasn’t for Jiang Luoli, she and her son wouldn’t have ended up like this.

Her son’s future wouldn’t be ruined just like that.

Madam Mo looked at the closed door with tears in her eyes.

Jiang Luoli, this jinx, snatched her son and ruined his future.

She had to get rid of her no matter what!

…

Mo Shixiu closed the door and sat down with Jiang Luoli.

His cold eyes landed on her swollen cheek again. “Does it still hurt?”

Of course it still hurt.

Madam Mo didn’t hold back.

How could it not hurt?

But Jiang Luoli didn’t want him to blame himself even more. She shook her head and lied. “It doesn’t hurt anymore.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Don’t lie to me.” Mo Shixiu’s fair and slender fingers gently touched her swollen cheek. Jiang Luoli frowned and trembled, then cried out in pain.

Mo Shixiu immediately retracted his hand and didn’t dare to touch her again.

He frowned and said coldly, “Why did you lie to me?”

Jiang Luoli blinked and looked at him aggrievedly. “I don’t want to see you blame yourself. If I say it hurts, won’t you feel even worse?”

Mo Shixiu was stunned for a while before looking at her with more self-reproach.

She felt even more heartache.

After a moment of silence, he patted her head and sighed. “So, you didn’t want me to blame myself, so you lied to me?”

“Mm.”

“Then, can you tell me the truth now?”

“You want to hear the truth?”

“Of course.” Mo Shixiu raised her chin and looked into her eyes. “Don’t lie to me. Tell me the truth.”

“Alright.” Jiang Luoli nodded. “Since you want to hear the truth, it hurts. It really hurts. Your mom hit me so hard that my mouth bled. Do you know that I almost fainted?”

Since he wanted to hear the truth, she’d better tell the entire truth.

Anyway, after what happened, she couldn’t even maintain a superficial relationship with Madam Mo.

She didn’t have to worry anymore.

Thus, she’d tell him everything about Madam Mo.

Moreover, she had to exaggerate.

She wanted him to know how scary Madam Mo was.

This way, even if she had nothing to do with Madam Mo in the future, Mo Shixiu had nothing to say.

Mo Shixiu’s expression was rather calm when she started, but then it changed.

The man’s expression darkened and his aura turned cold.

Jiang Luoli felt that something was wrong. She looked up and saw the coldness in his eyes.

This was the first time she saw Mo Shixiu’s terrifying side.

His aura was so cold that Jiang Luoli felt pressured.

Actually, Mo Shixiu usually had a very strong aura, and many people felt pressured.
