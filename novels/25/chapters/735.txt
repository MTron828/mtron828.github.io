Chapter 736: You Said You Never Thought of Divorcing Me?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

This was a tacit agreement.

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Did he really misunderstand her last sentence?

She felt that she wasn’t the one who kept thinking about the divorce.

Otherwise, why would he be so sensitive?

After finding out the reason, she couldn’t help but pinch his cheek. “Mo Yesi, can you trust me more? Why are you thinking about divorce? I’m just expressing my stand.”

The man allowed her to do as she pleased. His expression was still stiff, but his eyes weren’t so cold anymore. “Are you sure you don’t have that intention? Then, what do you mean? When we are still married, you won’t do anything to let me down. Then, when we get a divorce, you’ll be fine?

“You said you never thought of getting a divorce?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Gosh, how could this man’s thinking be like this?

“No, I...”

“You’ve thought about this before, haven’t you?” Mo Yesi’s eyes were dark and aggressive. “You don’t have confidence in our marriage. You don’t think we can last long. You think we’ll divorce one day.

“Even though our relationship isn’t bad and we get along well with each other, this harmony is only temporary. As time goes by, everything will change, right?”

“No, I...”

“Because we’re husband and wife, you’ll stick to your morals and not do anything immoral. Is that the reason?”

“No, Mo Yesi, can you listen to me first?” Qiao Mianmian didn’t want to be interrupted by him again. She immediately covered his mouth and said, “Listen to me, when I first married you, I wanted to divorce you.

“You know very well why we got together. Under those circumstances, no one would have thought that this marriage would last. But later, I started to understand you, and you treated me and Chen Chen so well...

“Then, I started to look forward to this marriage. I started to think that marrying you wasn’t too bad, and I started to want to spend more time with you. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“I thought about divorce at first, but I never thought about it again.

“Also, I can correct what I said just now.” She looked into his dark eyes and said slowly and seriously, “Mo Yesi, you’re my husband, the man who wants to spend the rest of his life with me. I’m actually not that big-hearted, and not many people can fit in.

“Once some places are occupied, there won’t be space for others.

“So, can you be more at ease with me?

“Can you have more confidence in yourself? Do you think I can still see other men when I have such an outstanding and perfect husband? Which man is more outstanding and attractive than you?”

The coldness in his eyes was melting.

Qiao Mianmian could feel the coldness around him diminishing and couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief.

It seemed like she was almost done coaxing him.

“Mo Yesi...” She sounded even more coquettish now. Knowing that he was giving in, she cupped his face and kissed him. “Don’t be angry anymore, alright? Have you had dinner? Are you hungry? I haven’t eaten, either. I’ll order a takeaway. Let’s eat first, alright?”
