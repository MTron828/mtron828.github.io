Chapter 3005: Your Wife Is Pregnant

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

With Mo Yesi’s perverted possessiveness, it would be better if they had a daughter.

If it was a son…

Tsk, when the time came, he would definitely feel that his wife was taken over by his son.

After all, women put most of their attention on children.

How could she still be so intimate with him?

Mo Yesi pursed his lips and glared at him expressionlessly.

“I’m speaking the truth.” Lu Rao walked towards him and patted his shoulder. “If you don’t believe me, you can ask your brother. Does your sister-in-law spend more effort on him or on your niece?

“Ask him if he regrets having a child so early.

“In any case, I want to spend a few more years alone with my wife. We’ll have children sooner or later, what’s the rush?”

Mo Yesi frowned. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Just as he was about to speak, the door of the examination room was opened.

Qiao Mianmian walked out with the doctor. She was holding the report.

The doctor smiled. “Congratulations, Mr. Mo. Your wife is pregnant. The baby is very healthy now, almost two months old.”

Stunned, MO Yesi turned to look at Qiao Mianmian.

The man’s eyes were filled with joy and excitement.

Even though he was mentally prepared, when the results were announced, he was still shocked by the immense joy.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t suppress her joy and excitement.

They looked at each other for a while.

Then, Qiao Mianmian yelled and threw herself into his arms.

MO Yesi’s expression changed. He immediately wrapped his arm around her waist and gently pulled her into his arms. “Baby, be careful. You can’t jump around like this.”

“Hubby!” Qiao Mianmian hugged his neck and tiptoed to kiss him on the lips. She smiled and said, “I’m really pregnant. I’m really pregnant with our baby.”

“Mm.” MO Yesi kissed her forehead again and again, his dark eyes full of joy. “Baby, you’re carrying our baby. We’re going to be parents.”

“Hubby, I’m so happy.” Qiao Mianmian’s dark eyes sparkled. “It feels so magical. I actually have a baby in my belly. I don’t know if it’s a boy or a girl. Do you want a boy or a girl?”

“It doesn’t matter.” MO Yesi lowered his head and rubbed it against her forehead. “1’11 like them as long as they’re our children.”

Lu Rao was speechless.

When he was single, he ate their dog food.

Now that he was married, he still ate their dog food.

That was enough.

He really didn’t know why the two of them were still in their honeymoon period after being married for so long.

He couldn’t wait to see if they would have the so-called seven-year itchO.

“Ahem, congratulations.” Lu Rao smiled and went forward. “Ah Si, Sis-in-law, congratulations. This is such a joyous occasion, shouldn’t you treat us to a meal?”

“Please.” MO Yesi was in a good mood. He reached out to fix Qiao Mianmian’s hair and didn’t dare to put too much force on her waist. “Call Shaoqing along. But we can’t do it today. Pick a time and place another day.”
