Chapter 2915: Is It Because of Miss Qiao?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

At this moment, someone knocked on the door.

Gong Zeli put his phone down and said, “Come in.”

When the door opened, his assistant walked in with a young girl and said respectfully, “Chairman Gong, Miss Su is here.”

Gong Zeli looked up and said calmly, “Mm.”

The assistant looked at the young girl beside him and then at Gong Zeli, who was sitting in the black leather chair. Not saying anything else, he turned to leave.

The door closed again.

The room was silent.

After about a minute

“Young Master Gong, why are you looking for me?” Su Su looked up at the handsome man in front of her. When her uneasy gaze landed on the man’s handsome face, she felt even more uneasy.

This was the first time Gong Zeli took the initiative to look for her.

And at his company, too.

Normally, Su Su would be very happy.

But at this moment, she couldn’t be happy.

She had already guessed Gong Zeli’s motive for calling her here.

She knew that this day would come sooner or later, but she still had a glimmer of hope in her heart, thinking that she could change it somehow.

But she was delusional in the end.

Gong Zeli pointed at the sofa. “Sit.”

Su Su stood rooted to the ground for a few seconds before sitting down obediently.

She placed her hands on her knees and sat upright, looking very obedient.

In Gong Zeli’s eyes, she was indeed a very compliant and obedient girl.

She had never caused him any trouble.

Hence, Gong Zeli felt that he could satisfy her as long as she didn’t make any unreasonable requests.

“The house you’re living in now, I’ll get someone to transfer it to your name. Also, this card has 10 million yuan on it. The password is six 1s. If you have any other requests, you can ask now. I’ll try my best to satisfy you.”

Gong Zeli placed the bank card on the table.

Su Su stiffened.

A few seconds later, she turned around stiffly. Her eyes were misty as she said, “Young Master Gong doesn’t want Su Su to stay by your side anymore?”

Gong Zeli turned to look at her. “You can make other requests. Besides what I said, what else do you want?”

Su Su’s eyes reddened.

“Is Su Su not good enough for Young Master Gong? Do you despise me? Young Master Gong, you can tell Su Su what you don’t like and she will change it.” Even though she knew that this was useless, Su Su still didn’t want to leave.

Because she knew very well, once she left Gong Zeli, it was practically impossible to see him again.

They were from two different classes.

If it wasn’t for her looks, she wouldn’t even have had the chance to stay by his side.

She knew that she was just a substitute.

But she thought that even as a substitute, as long as she could stay by his side, she would be satisfied. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

With her lowly status, what else could she ask for?

“It has nothing to do with you.” Gong Zeli didn’t feel any pity for her. He looked away and said indifferently, “You can ask for anything now. But if you miss this opportunity, it won’t come again.”

“Is it because of Miss Qiao?” Su Su could tell that there was no room for negotiation from Gong Zeli’s words. Quickly accepting reality, she wiped her tears and looked at Gong Zeli with reddened eyes... “Young Master Gong asked me to leave because of Miss Qiao?”
