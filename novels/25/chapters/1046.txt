Chapter 1047: You Haven’t Answered Me, What’s With Your Face?

Her intuition told her that Gong Zeli wasn’t that simple with Qiao Mianmian.

It wasn’t because he stood up for Qiao Mianmian.

But the way he looked at her...

It wasn’t normal.

But Linda wouldn’t tell Qiao Mianmian that.

In the past, she didn’t know Mo Yesi’s true identity, but now that she knew, some things couldn’t be said.

Linda looked up at Qiao Mianmian’s exquisite and beautiful face and wasn’t too surprised that Gong Zeli had feelings for her.

With such a beautiful face and age, who wouldn’t like her?

Even the Second Young Master of the Mo family, who never got close to women, liked her, so it wasn’t surprising that the Young Master of the Gong family liked her too.

But given the relationship between the Young Master of the Gong family and the Second Young Master of the Mo family, it might affect their friendship if they fell in love with the same woman.

Mo Yesi called shortly after Gong Zeli left.

Qiao Mianmian picked it up.

Mo Yesi asked her, “Where are you? I’m already at the restaurant, why don’t I see you?”

Qiao Mianmian touched her swollen cheek and hesitated for a while before giving him her location.

A few minutes later, Mo Yesi came over.

Linda was waiting with Qiao Mianmian. When she saw Mo Yesi, her mood changed completely.

She was already in awe of him when she didn’t know his true identity.

Now that she knew Mo Yesi’s true identity, she felt even more respect for him.

When Mo Yesi walked over, she called out respectfully, “Mr. Mo.”

Mo Yesi nodded slightly in response.

He only looked at Linda for a second before turning to Qiao Mianmian. He glanced at the side of her face and frowned.

He reached out to pull her hand away. “What’s wrong with your face?”

Seeing the handprint on Qiao Mianmian’s face, the man’s eyes turned cold. “Who hit you?”

Qiao Mianmian knew it.

She sighed lightly. “It’s because of a misunderstanding. Now that the matter has been resolved, are you hungry? Let’s go eat now.”

Mo Yesi stood still and stared at the fingerprint on her face. “You haven’t answered me. What’s with your face? Who hit you?”

“I’m really fine. I...”

Mo Yesi turned to look at Linda and said coldly, “You’ve been with her all this while. Tell me, what happened to her face?” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“This, Mr. Mo...” Linda looked at Qiao Mianmian hesitantly.

“It’s fine if she doesn’t want to say it, but you won’t? She’s an artiste under you, and she was bullied when she was with you. Do you want me to hold you accountable as a manager?”

“Mr. Mo...” Linda was shocked and immediately told him what happened.

Mo Yesi’s expression darkened.

“Su Ze’s woman did this?” He looked at Qiao Mianmian with a storm brewing in his eyes.
