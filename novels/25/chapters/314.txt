Chapter 315: This Friend of His Is Rather Pretty

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Of course, he wouldn’t do something like peeping at a girl’s body.

But that night...

Qiao Chen turned red as he recalled what took place that night.

He hadn’t done it deliberately, but he did see Shen Xin’s body, even though it was just her bare back. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The image of her fair skin drifted in his mind, bothering him.

“Come on, stop being so wishy-washy. You’re a guy, just agree to it.” Shen Xin got up and tiptoed, giving him a peck on the cheek.

Qiao Chen stiffened as his eyes widened.

Seeing that he was in a daze, Shen Xin took the opportunity and forced him into his seat.

This entire scene... was witnessed in full by Qiao Mianmian and Jiang Luoli.

“What the heck.”

Jiang Luoli was so agitated. “She kissed him? Then that means they’re definitely a couple. Chen Chen is pretty good at this, huh, landing such a good catch so quietly. The girl is taking so much initiative. She must like him a lot.

“But Chen Chen’s looks really are the sort to attract young girls.”

Qiao Mianmian initially wasn’t sure about Qiao Chen’s relationship with that girl.

But seeing how he hadn’t even evaded her or pushed her away when the girl tiptoed to kiss him, she confirmed her speculation that they were indeed an item.

But if she really was his girlfriend, why hadn’t she seen this girl visit Qiao Chen before when he was hospitalized?

And if she wasn’t actually his girlfriend, then how could she explain what had just happened?

Qiao Chen was her brother, and she knew him best.

The fact that he hadn’t pushed the girl away already said it all.

But it was also because she knew Qiao Chen so well that she found it impossible for them to be a couple.

Given Qiao Chen’s character, he wouldn’t get himself a girlfriend after finding out that he had a heart condition.

Moreover, they shared a close sibling bond, and Qiao Chen would tell her anything and everything.

He hadn’t ever mentioned this girl to her, though.

Qiao Mianmian could barely take it any longer.

She wanted to go over to Qiao Chen and ask him what this was all about. But it didn’t seem appropriate.

She thought for a while before sending Qiao Chen a message: [Chen Chen, where are you?]

The moment she sent it, she saw Qiao Chen pick up his cell phone.

She received a reply in less than a minute.

Chen Chen: [Sis, I’m having a meal with my classmate.]

Qiao Mianmian: [Classmate? Guy or girl?]

She looked up and saw Qiao Chen looking a little taken aback as he read the message.

She waited for a while more before his reply came in: [Girl.]

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but smile as she saw his reply.

Haha, he was still an honest lad.

Qiao Mianmian was thinking about sending him another message when she saw a familiar silhouette in her peripheral vision.

She looked up and furrowed her brows right away.

What was with her luck today?

She bumped into Qiao Anxin at the auditions.

And she bumped into Shen Rou at the restaurant.

She should’ve checked if this was going to be a bad day for her to leave the house.

Jiang Luoli noticed Qiao Mianmian’s expression and looked up too, asking curiously, “You know that woman in the black dress? Who is she?”

Qiao Mianmian replied calmly, “Mm, I do know her. She’s Mo Yesi’s friend.”

“Prince Charming’s friend?” Jiang Luoli eyed Shen Rou for a while longer.

“This friend of his is rather pretty.” She made an objective comment.
