Chapter 2774: Surpass Qiao Mianmian

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

It was obvious that Jiang Xinyue was just finding an excuse to join them. She definitely could find a place to eat.

Jiang Xinyue probably didn’t expect Zhan Bo to reject her.

And he rejected her… so badly.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but look at her. Jiang Xinyue’s expression wasn’t very good. She was rejected by Zhan Bo without being given any face. She must feel embarrassed.

Zhan Bo didn’t care if she was embarrassed or not. After saying that, he turned to Qiao Mianmian and said, “Mianmian, let’s hurry over. That store has a time limit for lunch. If we’re late, we won’t have enough time to eat.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Alright, since Zhan Bo didn’t seem to care, she didn’t have to be polite to Jiang Xinyue either.

She didn’t really want to interact with her.

After all, she felt uncomfortable interacting with someone who had undergone plastic surgery.

“Alright, let’s hurry over.” Qiao Mianmian nodded.

“Brother Han, let’s go.” Zhan Bo placed a hand on Qin Han’s shoulder. Besides refusing to let Jiang Xinyue tag along, he didn’t talk to her anymore.

“Then, Miss Jiang, we’ll take our leave first.” As a model senior in the industry, even though Qin Han didn’t really like Jiang Xinyue, he still did his part.

Qiao Anxin was furious.

She didn’t expect Zhan Bo to be so disrespectful.

She was indeed using the excuse of not being able to find a place to eat to join them.

Qin Han was the most popular artiste in the industry.

Although Zhan Bo’s status in the entertainment industry was not as good, he was still the most popular young hunk.

No matter who she got close to, it would be good for her in the future.

Since she chose to enter the entertainment industry again, she naturally had some ambition.

Her ambition was to surpass Qiao Mianmian.

She wanted to be better than Qiao Mianmian.

She could give up everything for this goal.

And quickly getting into Qiao Mianmian’s circle would help her achieve her goals faster.

Qiao Anxin didn’t think that Zhan Bo would reject her.

After all, the live stream was still ongoing, and many netizens were watching.

It would be too ungentlemanly of him to reject her.

And it was easy to be labeled as an outcast.

Hence, she thought neither Zhan Bo nor Qin Han would reject her request.

Unexpectedly, not only did Zhan Bo reject her in front of tens of millions of netizens in the live stream, but he also did it so bluntly and mercilessly.

He didn’t hide his dislike for her.

But his attitude towards Qiao Mianmian was different. This stark contrast made Qiao Anxin feel even more embarrassed and angry and feel as if she’d been slapped.

She couldn’t vent her anger.

She had to show that she didn’t mind it.

“Alright, please take care. If I have the chance next time, I’ll definitely treat you to a meal.” Qiao Anxin took a deep breath and forced a smile before speaking..
