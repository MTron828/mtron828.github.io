Chapter 532: He Didn’t Force Me

He would have given his life if she asked for it.

He wanted to tell her that they didn’t need to have a child if she was so afraid.

He couldn’t bear for her to be in fear.

He couldn’t bear for her to go through the pain as well.

Extending his family line wasn’t important to him, anyway. Even if she didn’t want to have any children, it didn’t affect him at all.

They could adopt a child as well.

They could even adopt a child from one of the Mo branch families.

The matter of fact was that it wasn’t hard for him to get a child. She didn’t need to get pregnant to get one.

But if she had his child, he was willing to accept it even if he didn’t like children. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Alright,” he replied as he continued to stare at her. He then patted her the head and continued, “If you don’t want to have a child, we won’t have one.”

“Uh...”

Qiao Mianmian wanted to correct him. It wasn’t that she didn’t want to carry a child, she just didn’t want to have one so early.

...

Mo Yesi insisted on accompanying her to the pharmacy. As they entered the store, the attendant approached them to ask what they wanted to purchase.

As the attendant was told that Qiao Mianmian wanted the morning after pill, she frowned and gave Mo Yesi a deep look.

The attendant was a middle-aged woman.

She wasn’t like the young girls that couldn’t keep their eyes off Mo Yesi when they saw him.

She wasn’t attracted to Mo Yesi even though she found him handsome.

“Young lady, are you asking for the morning after pill for your own needs?” The middle-aged woman gave Mo Yesi another deep look. As she looked at Qiao Mianmian, she started to get angry.

Qiao Mianmian was young.

It was the first time that she was purchasing such things, and the attendant was also giving her a strange look. Hence, Qiao Mianmian started to feel embarrassed and replied softly, “Yes.”

The attendant frowned.

She suddenly reached out to grab her hand and said, “We have quite a few types here. Follow me and I’ll tell you more about them.”

She dragged Qiao Mianmian as she spoke.

As he witnessed the attendant drag Qiao Mianmian to a corner of the store, he started to frown.

It felt like the attendant was giving him a strange look just now.

Behind one of the cabinets.

The middle-aged woman lowered her voice and asked angrily, “Tell me the truth, young lady. Were you forced into doing it with that guy? Don’t be scared, tell me what happened and I’ll help you.”

Qiao Mianmian was confused.

She replied honestly with a blank look, “He didn’t force me.”

“He didn’t force you?” The middle-aged woman recalled Mo Yesi’s good looks and understood. She sighed. “So, he must have used his good looks and sweet-talk you into doing it with him.

“Young lady, I have a daughter about the same age as you. Hence, as you feel like a daughter to me, I’ll just be blunt. He’s really good-looking. But even though he’s handsome, you can’t be with a criminal.”

Qiao Mianmian was confused again. She couldn’t understand what the middle-aged woman was saying.

Mo Yesi was a criminal?
