Chapter 261: He Should Be the One to Apologize on His Own

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Thank you, Mom.” Qiao Mianmian thanked her politely after accepting the gift.

Madam Mo was speechless.

Her heart ached.

She really liked that bracelet.

“My mom really does love this bracelet; she has it on all the time.” Mo Yesi smiled and said, “You’ve fair skin and jade would look good on you. I’ll get you a pair of jade earrings and necklace another day for you to wear it as a set.”

He wasn’t loud, but Madam Mo and Shen Rou heard him clearly.

Madam Mo was getting jealous now. This was the son she raised, but he’d never even been this thoughtful towards her. “It’s true when they say a son forgets his mother once he has a wife. Well, when have you gotten me such things?”

Mo Yesi smiled. “Mom, are you getting jealous of your daughter-in-law? Didn’t you always say you wished to bear me a younger sister? I don’t have one now, but you can consider your daughter-in-law your actual daughter. Shouldn’t you be happy that I’m doting on your daughter?”

Madam Mo had no idea how to respond to him.

She was about to say that she didn’t have an intention to see her as a daughter.

But given Mo Yesi’s temper, it was best she didn’t mention anything negative about this woman.

If she embarrassed Qiao Mianmian, it would only strain her relationship with her son.

She wasn’t so foolish.

“There’s a jade auction next month, I think the design of that jewelry set suits you. You painfully gave away your beloved bangle to Mianmian, so I will make it up to you by getting that set for you. How’s that?”

Madam Mo and Mo Yuncheng were very loving. Although she was already over 40, Mo Yuncheng still showered her with love, as if she was a little princess.

Hence, Mo Yesi followed in his footsteps and usually pampered Madam Mo too.

He agreed to get the jade jewelry for Madam Mo the moment she brought it up.

“Well, you said it yourself.” Madam Mo felt her importance in her son’s heart and didn’t feel so upset anymore.

“Mm, I said it.”

Mo Yesi smiled and asked Qiao Mianmian, “Are you tired, do you need to sleep? I’ll take you to the bedroom for a rest?”

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t tired, but she wanted to get out of this spot.

Although Old Madam and Madam Mo seemed like easy-going people, she didn’t feel comfortable being in front of the elders.

She quietly responded, “Mm.”

“Alright, I’ll take you to the bedroom for a nap then.”

Mo Yesi turned to Old Madam and Madam Mo. “Mom, Grandma, you’ve seen her now. It’s about time you had your naps, right? I’m a little tired too, I’ll catch some sleep now. Call me up when it’s time for dinner.”

With that, he was about to leave with Qiao Mianmian.

“Ah Si.”

Shen Rou’s voice rang out.

Mo Yesi furrowed his brows slightly as he turned to face her.

Shen Rou stood up and bit her lip. “What happened the other time... I apologize to you on Zeli’s behalf. He was too impulsive that day. In fact, he regretted it the moment he left.”

Mo Yesi eyed her for a few seconds as he frowned even harder. When he spoke, there was some coldness in his voice that wasn’t there before. “He should be the one to apologize on his own. Also, he shouldn’t be apologizing to me, but to Mianmian.”

Shen Rou’s expression turned a little awful when she noticed his cold attitude.

She could sense it. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Ever since they left on a bad note the last time, Mo Yesi had become much colder towards her.
