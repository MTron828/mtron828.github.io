Chapter 33: Don’t Throw a Tantrum, Okay?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“I’m very grateful that you’re so good to Chen Chen. But this watch really doesn’t suit him. You can force him to accept it, but he won’t dare to wear it out. If you really want to give him something, you can give him something less expensive.

“As for this card...”

She hesitated before saying, “I can make a little money myself. I...”

Before she finished, she was interrupted by the man’s cold voice. “I can take the watch back temporarily, but I will give it to him when he is suitable to wear it. This card, however, you must keep it.”

“I...”

“If it’s known that my wife still needs to make her own money and spend her own money, won’t I feel ashamed?”

“I didn’t...”

Mo Yesi raised his hand to interrupt her again. His eyes were slightly dimmed and narrowed, and his voice was a little cold. “Qiao Mianmian, did you refuse Su Ze’s money before too?”

Qiao Mianmian paused.

She pursed her lips and remained silent.

Of course she didn’t refuse Su Ze’s money.

But how was it the same?

She and Su Ze had known each other for so many years. As for him... less than a day.

Her silence made the man next to her colder. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

In the driving seat.

Uncle Li saw in the rear-view mirror that the atmosphere between the two wasn’t right, so he summoned the courage to say, “Master, Madam, where are you going to eat?”

Qiao Mianmian kept her lips tight and didn’t say a word.

She was frightened by Mo Yesi and was a little angry with him.

She didn’t think she was wrong.

So what if she was married to him?

They had only just met for less than a day.

To her, this so-called “husband” was no different from a stranger.

How could she get used to spending a stranger’s money so quickly!

When Qiao Mianmian was angry, her face bulged and her eyes rounded. She also liked to twist her head to one side and ignore him.

Looking at her awkward posture, Mo Yesi felt the pent up frustration in his heart disappear.

He chuckled and pressed a hand on her shoulder, pulling her body towards him. “Are you angry?”

Qiao Mianmian pursed her lips and lowered her eyes, refusing to speak.

Mo Yesi raised his eyebrows, and the smile on his lips deepened. “Sorry, let me apologize to you.”

“My attitude was bad just now, I shouldn’t have spoken to you like that. Did I scare you?”

The girl’s eyelashes fluttered slightly, and she bit her pink lips tightly, her face still bulging.

Mo Yesi looked down at her for a moment, pinching her jaw with his fingers, and raised her head.

He lowered his voice and stared at her with deep eyes. “Mianmian, don’t throw a tantrum, okay?”

“Just understand that my previous reaction was out of jealousy... I’m a little jealous of Su Ze.”

His cold fingers were locked on her jaw.

When he got closer, the scent of his body penetrated Qiao Mianmian’s nose.

Qiao Mianmian’s ears were almost crisped off instantly with the word “Mianmian” screaming itself into her ears.

Even her heart trembled.

The man’s light voice was seductive, causing Qiao Mianmian’s heart to tremble.

Her face was hot again, and she didn’t even remember that she was angry.

She looked up and stared at his intense gaze. Her heart trembled again and her face blushed red.

This man’s face was too handsome and charming.

His eyes were even more fascinating.

If she was careless, she would be lost in the vast ocean that was his eyes.
