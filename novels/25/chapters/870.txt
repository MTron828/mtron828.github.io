Chapter 871: I Don’t Want Such a Friend

“Really?”

“Mm.”

“Then, if I say...” Qiao Mianmian bit her lip and hesitated for a while before saying, “I hope you’d better not interact with her anymore. What do you think?”

Would he think that her request was too much?

Qiao Mianmian also knew that Mo Yesi liked her.

She held a certain place in his heart. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

But she still wasn’t confident that he would agree to her request.

Shen Rou and he had been friends for over 20 years.

Was it too much to ask them to stop contacting each other?

She didn’t expect Mo Yesi to agree.

Hence, when he kept quiet for a while and didn’t answer her immediately, Qiao Mianmian was about to tell him to forget it when he gave a surprising answer. “Alright, I won’t interact with her anymore.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“You agreed?”

Mo Yesi looked at her. “Isn’t this what you wanted?”

“But, haven’t you known each other for a long time? Are you really willing to...”

Before she could finish speaking, Mo Yesi reached out and pulled her into his arms. “She and I have been friends for a long time, but you’re my wife, the person who will accompany me for the rest of my life. I know very well what’s important between friends and family. Moreover, she did something to hurt you. I won’t tolerate it even if she’s a good friend.

“My friend should know how to love the person and everything and everyone around them. She shouldn’t have hurt you when she knows how much I care about you. When she did this, she didn’t consider our so-called friendship.

“I don’t want such a friend.”

Mo Yesi didn’t have many feelings for Shen Rou.

Although they had known each other for over 20 years.

Shen Rou was also his only friend.

But he was a cold person by nature. Even though he had known her for many years, if her temper wasn’t to his liking, he wouldn’t develop feelings for her just because she stayed by his side for a long time.

If he didn’t like it, he didn’t like it.

All these years, he didn’t really like Shen Rou, nor did he hate her.

As they’d known each other for a long time, he was more tolerant of her in some matters.

This made Shen Rou his only female friend.

But this one and only meant nothing.

In other words, Shen Rou and Qiao Mianmian were incomparable.

It was a perfect answer.

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but smile. “You agreed to it yourself, I didn’t force you. If you regret it in the future...”

“I won’t regret it. I’ve already made things clear to her. From now on, we’re no longer friends.” Mo Yesi looked like he was asking for praise. “Honey, do you think my performance is alright?”

Qiao Mianmian held back her laughter and pretended to consider it for a while before nodding. “Mm, it’s... alright.”

“Then, shouldn’t you reward me if I perform well?”

“How do you want the reward?”

Mo Yesi looked down at her cherry blossom lips. “I want a kiss, is that alright?”

Qiao Mianmian asked, “... Are you sure it’s just a kiss?”

“Mm.” Mo Yesi nodded, his handsome face magnified in front of her eyes. “Just a kiss. Baby, is it alright?”
