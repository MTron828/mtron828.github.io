Chapter 1650: If It Was Me, I’d naturally Be on Your Side

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

In fact, even if she and Mo Yesi got their marriage certificate first, Madam Mo hadn’t given up.

After they got married, she still tried to force her to break up with Mo Yesi.

Not to mention Jiang Luoli.

Madam Mo valued family status so much that she definitely didn’t want Jiang Luoli to marry Mo Shixiu.

Mo Yesi narrowed his eyes and kept quiet for a few seconds. He then walked into the house with her in his arms. “Does Big Brother know about this?”

Qiao Mianmian shook her head. “Luo Luo hasn’t told him yet. She called me to ask for my opinion. Should I tell Big Brother about this?”

“Then, what did you suggest?”

“I told her to tell him.” Qiao Mianmian didn’t hide it and said honestly, “Luo Luo definitely can’t beat Mom. Mom wants her to break up with Big Brother. If she doesn’t succeed this time, she definitely won’t give up.

“Only by letting Big Brother know about this can he protect Luo Luo.

“Moreover, this happened because of him. He should know about it.

“Do you I’m right?”

They entered the bedroom.

Mo Yesi put Qiao Mianmian on the bed and looked down at her. “Your suggestion isn’t a problem. We have to let Big Brother know about this. You’re right, Jiang Luoli isn’t Mom’s match. She can only be protected if Big Brother knows about this.”

“Don’t you think I’m being selfish?” Qiao Mianmian looked up at him.

“Selfish?” Mo Yesi smiled. “Why?”

“I asked Luo Luo to tell Big Brother about this on purpose. It may cause a conflict between Big Brother and Mom.”

Mo Yesi was stunned. He then smiled and pinched her cheek. “I know what kind of person my wife is. I know you’re worried about Jiang Luoli’s safety.”

The man’s absolute trust made Qiao Mianmian feel sweet inside.

She smiled. “Then, do you think Big Brother will be on Luo Luo’s side or Mom’s? What do you think?”

Mo Yesi sat down beside her and patted her head. “Big Brother and I have similar personalities. I only know that if it was me, I’d naturally side with you. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“If they’re all people I care about, I’ve always chosen the side of reason.

“Moreover, Mom is wrong this time.”

“Then, I’m relieved.” Qiao Mianmian sighed. “This is the first time Brother and Luo Luo encountered trouble in their relationship. I really hope they can have a good ending. It would be a pity if they break up for this reason.”

“There will be good results.”

Mo Yesi pulled her into his arms and kissed her on the forehead. “There’s only one reason why Big Brother and Jiang Luoli would break up.”

Qiao Mianmian blinked and asked curiously, “What reason?”

“Jiang Luoli doesn’t want to be with him. As long as she still wants to be with Big Brother, they won’t separate.

“So, you don’t have to worry about her.

“It’s getting late, you have to wake up early tomorrow morning. Go to sleep.”

Qiao Mianmian looked at the time. It was indeed getting late.

She nodded. “Mm.”

...

The next morning, Qiao Mianmian went to the set.

Mo Yesi woke up early and drove her.

This was the last day of filming.

After today, Qiao Mianmian’s first show officially ended.

On this day, everyone was in high spirits and working efficiently.
