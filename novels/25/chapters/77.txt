Chapter 78: Yes, Don’t Overthink

“Wait.” Mo Yesi reached out and held her shoulder, his lips moving as if he wanted to say something.

Qiao Mianmian blinked. “What is it?”

He frowned slightly and a hint of hesitation flashed in his eyes. After a moment, he said, “I can explain to you what Lu Rao said just now.”

Qiao Mianmian’s face was blank. “??”

She was stunned. “Explain... explain what?”

Mo Yesi stared at her with his deep and charming dark eyes for a long while and said seriously, “The Young Lady Shen that Lu Rao talked about is called Shen Rou. She’s Shen Consortium’s young lady and I have indeed grown up with her. Old Master Shen and my grandfather are friends, so our relationship has always been good. In the past, they made arrangements for our engagement, but neither I nor Shen Rou has any intentions for that, so we just dropped the idea.

“Mianmian, Shen Rou is two years younger than me. In my heart, she’s just like a sister.

“So, you don’t have to mind her presence.”

Qiao Mianmian went quiet.

She... didn’t mind.

She didn’t even say that she minded.

Why did he and Lu Rao think she would misunderstand it?

She really didn’t misunderstand, and neither did she overthink about it!

Furthermore, she also wouldn’t mind if he really had anything to do with Young Lady Shen.

His marriage with her was just to satisfy each other’s needs and there was no element of love in it.

She needed him to perform surgery on Qiao Chen, and he had chosen her because she was the only woman he did not have a rejection reaction to.

If she didn’t have such a unique quality to her, he wouldn’t even choose to marry a woman like her.

Qiao Mianmian was very self-aware and knew where she stood, so of course she wouldn’t be jealous.

However, in view of Mo Yesi’s serious explanation, she responded, “Okay, I understand. Don’t worry, I won’t mind her.”

Mo Yesi stared at her. “You really don’t mind?”

“Really!” She nodded heavily. “Didn’t you just say that you treat her as a sister? I believe you.”

“Okay, don’t overthink.” Mo Yesi reached out to caress her head while smiling. “Okay, let’s go. I’ll send you back to school.”

On the other side.

After Su Ze received a message from Jiang Luoli, he immediately went to Qiao Mianmian.

Qiao Anxin was with him. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

They were choosing jewelry in a jewelry store.

“Brother Ah Ze, do I look good in this necklace?” Qiao Anxin tried on a pink diamond necklace and smiled charmingly at Su Ze.

Su Ze glanced at her distractedly.

He hesitated for two seconds, drew a black card from his bag, and handed it to Qiao Anxin while saying softly, “Baby, I’m in a hurry. I can’t stay with you anymore. Just buy whatever you like, then I’ll accompany you when I’m done, okay?”

Qiao Anxin was dissatisfied. “What could be so urgent? You said you would accompany me today.”

Before Su Ze could reply, Qiao Anxin looked down at the phone clutched in his hand and asked suspiciously, “Brother Ah Ze, who were you chatting with just now?”

“I...” Su Ze glanced at her and hesitated, but he still said honestly, “Anxin, the girl in Mianmian’s dormitory just texted me that Mianmian is in trouble. She told me to go over immediately.

“She seemed anxious. I’m worried that Mianmian might be injured.”
