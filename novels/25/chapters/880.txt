Chapter 881: This Will Ruin You Forever!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Mianmian could tell that the voice belonged to Tu Yilei’s manager, Michael.

“Oh my God, Little Tu!”

Hurried footsteps came over, and soon, Huang Yilin screamed too.

Qiao Mianmian was shocked to see what happened.

The thing that should have been on her face was on Tu Yilei.

Tu Yilei’s hand was as fair as jade. The back of his hand was red, and a layer of skin had been peeled off. Blood was seeping out of the wound and dripping down the back of his hand.

He looked like he was in pain, but he bit his lip and kept quiet.

Michael looked like he was about to break down.

Tears rolled down his cheeks as he held his injured hand.

He was angry, anxious, and heartbroken. “Little Tu Tu, are you crazy! Have you never thought of the consequences? Have you ever thought of ruining your life like this! Lunatic! Are you trying to anger me to death?

“Gosh, how could the injury on his hand be so serious? Someone, quickly call 911. Little Tu is injured, quickly send him to the hospital!”

“What to do, what to do? There’s so much blood, what to do!”

Qiao Mianmian stared at the bleeding wound on Tu Yilei’s hand and widened her eyes in shock.

So, the person who pushed her away and stood in front of her was... Tu Yilei?

Huang Yilin splashed sulfuric acid at her face. She had prepared it long ago. She must have thought of perishing together with her if she didn’t agree.

The acid was directed at her face.

Even if she covered her face, if Tu Yilei hadn’t pushed her away in time and helped her block the bottle of sulfuric acid, she didn’t dare to imagine the consequences.

Qiao Mianmian never expected Tu Yilei to stand in front of her.

He was the most popular male artiste.

Even if he didn’t rely on his looks, as an actor, his looks were still very important.

Especially a good-looking actor like him.

If his face was ruined...

It was a lifetime blow to ordinary people.

Not to mention the male actors in the entertainment industry...

It was an unimaginable blow.

Not just his career, but his entire life.

Tu Yilei must have thought of these consequences when he chose to stand in front of her.

He should be able to guess what was in the blue bottle in Huang Yilin’s hand.

Why did he do this?

Qiao Mianmian was shocked beyond words.

The security officers from the crew rushed over with Michael.

Huang Yilin was already stopped by them, but she was still struggling frantically. She yelled with a distorted expression, “Qiao Mianmian, you slut. You’re so cruel, you’ll get your retribution.

“I curse you. I curse you every moment of every day. You won’t have a good ending!

“Hahaha, Tu Yilei, you fool. You actually made yourself like this for such a slut. Do you think she’ll be touched and like you because of this? Stop dreaming! Your effort is completely worthless! You’re a fool, the biggest fool!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Take this crazy woman away!” Michael turned around, his eyes red. He gritted his teeth and said, “She hurt my Little Tu Tu. I want her to pay the price. I’ll make sure she goes to jail!”
