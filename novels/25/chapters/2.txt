Chapter 3: This Is a First

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

When Qiao Mianmian woke up, she was alone on the huge bed, but there was still the sound of water coming from the bathroom.

She sat up against the bed frame, and her mind was a blank for a good few seconds. Then, her memories came rushing back.

She went pale as she remembered what happened the previous night.

While she was still immersed in thought, the sound of water in the bathroom ceased.

Qiao Mianmian did not think much about it. She hopped off the bed despite the discomfort she felt and hurriedly put on her clothes, before turning to leave quietly.

Qiao Mianmian had only taken a few steps when the bathroom door opened.

Mo Yesi walked out of the bathroom. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

He had a bath towel wrapped around him, but his toned chest and broad shoulders were well-exposed.

His head of wet hair gave him a casual look.

He swept a glance across the room and was stunned for a moment when he realized that the messy bed was now empty. Slightly confused, he walked towards the bed.

He gave Lu Rao a call and soon heard a lazy voice. “Ah Si, what got you taking the initiative to call me for a change?”

Mo Yesi ignored his teasing and went straight to the point. “There was a lady in my room last night.”

It went silent.

Then, he heard the man on the line cough as if he’d choked upon hearing the news. “W-What did you say? Ah Si, am I understanding you correctly? You and the woman... have done it?”

Mo Yesi simply acknowledged. “Mm.”

The man continued coughing and trying to catch his breath as if he’d just seen the sun rise in the West. “Heck! Haven’t you always detested women touching you? I remember a woman who accidentally touched you once, and you immediately went off to wash your hands 10 times over.”

Mo Yesi went quiet for a few moments before saying, “She’s different from the rest. My body doesn’t feel repulsed by her. In fact, I like it when she gets near me.”

The lady last night did not make him feel revolted at all.

Moreover, he even liked her faint fragrant scent.

He couldn’t help but want to get closer to her.

He called Lu Rao to understand just what was going on with him.

He’d never experienced anything like this.

“And...” Mo Yesi looked down at the messy bed and hesitated before saying, “I slept for six hours last night. I didn’t wake up in the middle, nor did I have that nightmare.”

Lu Rao was extremely surprised. “What’s going on here?”

Mo Yesi rubbed his temple and his voice went a little hoarse. “I wouldn’t be calling you if I knew. I’m wondering, has it got something to do with her?”

Lu Rao asked, “The woman who made you impure?”

Mo Yesi went quiet.

Lu Rao stopped his cheekiness and got serious. “If you want to know whether it’s got something to do with her, then that’s simple. Just have contact with her another time.”

Mo Yesi was still silent.

Lu Rao said, “Ah Si, I’m not kidding with you. If it’s really something about her, she might just be your savior.”

Savior?

His world had been dark and gloomy for 20 years, he thought he’d long been used to it.

If he hadn’t felt warmth or seen light, he’d have continued getting used to this life.

But after experiencing the good, he was unwilling to return to the darkness.

If she really was his savior, then he had to have her, whatever it took.

Wei Zheng picked up the phone and heard a low, clear voice. “Find out who the woman in my room last night is. Now.”

“Yes, President Mo.”
