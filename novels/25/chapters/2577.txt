Chapter 2578: Uncontrollable Jealousy

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Even her pimples were cute.

Gong Zeli saw Qiao Mianmian’s last post.

It was about a week ago.

There was only one sentence: [Someone has been getting naggy recently. Is he entering menopause early?]

Yan Shaoqing even commented on this post: “Sis-in-law, Second Bro only nags at you. He doesn’t even say anything unnecessary to us. This isn’t the prelude to menopause, this is how he loves you.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Qiao Mianmian replied to him.

Mo Yesi also replied: “I think Shaoqing is right.”

Qiao Mianmian: “Then, can you do it another way?”

Mo Yesi: “Like what? In the future, we’ll use kissing?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Yan Shaoqing: “Please be good. Can you consider my feelings as a single person? Can you not show your affection in the comment section? Can’t you do it in private?”

Mo Yesi: “If you’re envious, find a wife soon. I can tell Old Master Yan to arrange a few blind dates for you.”

Yan Shaoqing: “No, Second Bro, I was wrong. I’ll go offline. You and Sis-in-law can pretend that I don’t exist. You can chat however you want.”

From the interactions in the comment section, it could be seen that they had a good relationship.

It was obvious that Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi had a good relationship.

Gong Zeli looked at this post and couldn’t help but feel jealous.

At that moment, he couldn’t tell if he was jealous of Yan Shaoqing’s good relationship with Mo Yesi and Qiao Mianmian, or jealous of the sweet happiness between Mo Yesi and Qiao Mianmian in their daily replies.

Or both.

He looked at it for a while, and it was only when Yan Shaoqing started to urge him that he quickly recorded Qiao Mianmian’s WeChat message and pretended to make a call.

…

Qiao Mianmian was shortlisted for the 23rd Golden Globe Award for Best Female Lead because of her first television drama “If You Can’t Love”.

The Golden Globe Awards’ official Weibo posted the nomination list.

Almost all the nominees were capable and experienced actors with several representative works.

For example, Shen Fei, Qin Han, and Jiang Yanling.

As for the rest, even if they didn’t receive any awards, they were all rather reputable in the industry.

As the only newbie, Qiao Mianmian stood out.

When the fans saw this list, they were naturally happy for their idol.

“Wow, Mianmian was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Female Lead for her first television drama. Our Mianmian is too amazing. As a member of Mianmian’s fan club, I’m too proud!”

“The first television drama that Mianmian starred in has the best viewership ratings this year. The viewership ratings alone are already very good, and now she’s been shortlisted for such an amazing award. This is a form of proof of Mianmian’s capability. Her first production has such good results, and her future development is limitless. But as Mianmian’s fans, we can’t be proud. You have to know that arrogance leads to defeat. Mianmian is still a newbie, and there are still many things to learn in the future.”

“To be honest, I’m not surprised that Mianmian was nominated for the Best Female Lead Award. Her performance in ‘If You Can’t Love’ was really good. She wasn’t at all inferior to Qin Han..”
