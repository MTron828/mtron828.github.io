Chapter 1584: You Dare to Offend Bai Yusheng?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

She met Boss Huang’s covetous gaze and frowned. She held back her disgust and turned to the waiter behind her. “Who sent me the red wine and fruit plate?”

“It was me.”

Before the waiter could speak, Boss Huang answered first. “I saw Miss Qiao just now. I wanted to go over and greet you, but I was afraid of offending the beauty, so I used that method to greet Miss Qiao.

“Since Miss Qiao is here, why don’t you play with us?”

Boss Huang was a crude person.

Now that he was talking to Qiao Mianmian in such a genteel manner, it felt weird.

Those who knew Boss Huang saw this scene and found it funny.

“Damn, I’m dying of laughter. This is the first time I’ve seen Boss Huang use this method to pick up girls. I wonder who learned this gentle emphasis from.”

“It seems like this woman really catches his eye. This is the woman he was talking about? She’s really good-looking. No wonder Old Huang, this flower lover, is so obsessed with her.”

“This girl is really good-looking. I rarely see such a good-looking woman. Tsk tsk, look at that face, that figure, and that snow-like skin. Just looking at her, I can imagine that it must be very enjoyable.”

“She makes me want to play too.”

“Don’t even think about it. Didn’t Old Huang say that this woman has something to do with Bai Yusheng? Do dare you to offend him?”

“So what if she has something to do with Bai Yusheng? He might just lose interest after a few days of fun. She’s not a proper girlfriend. She’s just an actress. Do you think Bai Yusheng will marry her?”

No matter how the women in the room belittled Qiao Mianmian.

The moment she appeared, all the men’s eyes were on her.

They seemed to have lost interest in their female companions.

Qiao Mianmian had a terrible impression of Boss Huang.

After knowing he was the one who sent the fruit platter and red wine, she wanted to get the waiter to return it. But even though she detested Boss Huang, she still politely rejected him. “No, I came with a friend. She’s still waiting for me. I have to go back.”

Boss Huang had been eyeing her for so long, how could he let her go so easily?

“Miss Qiao, since you’re already here, you’d better sit down with us. You and your friend are just two people, it’s so boring. I’ll get someone to call your friend over.”

With that, he said to the waiter, “Call the lady over.”

“No need.”

Qiao Mianmian immediately stopped the waiter. “My friend and I don’t like to be around too many people, and we don’t like to play with unfamiliar people. I’m sorry, my friend is still waiting for me. I have to go.”

Qiao Mianmian turned around and left.

Boss Huang panicked.

He quickly chased after her and held her arm, not letting her leave. “Miss Qiao, what’s the rush? It’s not too late to sit down and play for a while before leaving. The people in our room aren’t jackals or leopards that will eat you. Don’t be afraid.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Qiao Mianmian felt disgusted the moment Boss Huang grabbed her arm. She recalled what Nana had told her about Boss Huang and felt her stomach churn.
