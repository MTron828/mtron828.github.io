Mo Yesi smiled. “Do I look like I’m kidding?”

“Brother-in-law, you’re amazing!” Qiao Chen wasn’t stingy with his praises towards this generous brother-in-law. “No wonder Sister would marry you. It’s so hard to find a man as good as you, Brother-in-law. My sister is really lucky to have married you.”

Mo Yesi happily accepted these praises.

He felt that this brother-in-law of his was really good with words.

It seemed like he deserved more than a car.

He asked, “Besides a car, do you have anything else you want?”

Qiao Chen was stunned for a moment, then an idea crossed his mind. He was even more excited now. “Brother-in-law, is your status especially impressive? The sort that can get lots of things done, that normal people can’t?”

Before Mo Yesi said anything, Uncle Li laughed in the driver’s seat and replied for him. “Mr. Qiao Chen, Young Master is a really impressive man. You can let him know if you need to get anything done. Young Master will definitely be able to do it for you.”

He wasn’t being boastful.

The Mo family really was one of the most powerful ones in the country.

If even they weren’t able to get something done, others definitely wouldn’t have a chance to.

Uncle Li could tell that Mo Yesi placed importance on Qiao Chen too, that was why he could speak for him.

As he guessed, Mo Yesi wasn’t unhappy with what he did or said at all. He even nodded in agreement. “Uncle Li is right. If you need anything, just let me know.”

Qiao Chen’s eyes lit up. “Brother-in-law, I don’t have anything I want. But, I’d like to meet a person.”

“Who?”

“Si Nan, the captain of the E.G Team. He’s my idol, and I’ve been wanting to meet him for the longest time. But it’s fine if I can’t meet him. Just an autographed picture would work too. Brother-in-law, can you help me get an autographed picture of him?”

Qiao Chen pleaded.

He knew that his brother-in-law was a powerful man, and this shouldn’t be that difficult to achieve.

But Si Nan was someone with an erratic temper.

Although his brother-in-law was impressive and powerful, Si Nan might not necessarily agree to meet him.

Hence, Qiao Chen would be very content to just have an autographed picture of his idol. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Si Nan?” Mo Yesi raised a brow. “The E.G Team you’re referring to is an eSports team?”

“Yeah! Brother-in-law, you know the E.G Team too?” Qiao Chen was shocked.

“I heard a bit about them. Having you meet Si Nan isn’t a difficult thing to achieve. Pick a day, I’ll let both of you meet.”

Qiao Chen was astonished. “Brother-in-law, you can get Si Nan to meet me?”

Mo Yesi smiled. “Mm.”

“R-Really? You can get Si Nan to meet me?” Qiao Chen was getting incoherent. His slightly pale face was now a little reddened, and the light in his eyes was unmistakable.

“Of course.”

Mo Yesi wondered if he told Qiao Chen that the E.G Team was actually signed under the Mo Corporation, would Qiao Chen faint from excitement?

He thought for a bit but decided otherwise.

His brother-in-law was someone with a heart condition.

He’d just been discharged from the hospital. It was best he didn’t get too agitated.

If anything went wrong, how would he account for it to his wife?

Qiao Chen’s tongue got even glibber as he immersed in the happiness of being able to meet his idol soon. “Wow, Brother-in-law, you’re too amazing.”
