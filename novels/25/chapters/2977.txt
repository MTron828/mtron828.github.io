Chapter 2979: Acting Pitiful

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

No wonder the car he saw outside looked familiar.

He knew it. Mo Yesi couldn’t wait to hang his sister on him. How could he really not see her for a few days?

Tsk tsk.

It was only the second day, and he couldn’t take it anymore. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Mo Yesi was really a weirdo.

He was cold to everyone and didn’t care about anything, but he fell for a woman.

Most importantly, this guy used to be so distant from women that everyone in the industry thought that he had a problem with his sexual orientation.

Back then, who would’ve thought that he‘d fall for a woman like this?

He was practically obsessed with her.

If Mo Yesi was with another woman, he would definitely laugh at him for being a slave to his wife.

But Mo Yesi married his sister.

Bai Yusheng was happy to see this happen.

Qiao Mianmian walked out of the villa and saw Mo Yesi’s car parked under a tree not too far away.

She walked over.

The lights in the car were on, and the window was half-open. The man was sitting in the driver’s seat, and the light yellow light shone on his handsome face. His three-dimensional and deep facial features were so beautiful that her heart raced. Even though she’d seen this face countless times, Qiao

Mianmian’s heart would still flutter every time she saw it.

It was like their first meeting.

She thought that she would still be the same even after 10, 20, or 30 years.

It was as if they had telepathy.

Qiao Mianmian had just walked over when the man in the car suddenly turned around. Seeing her standing outside the car, the man’s good-looking lips curled up slightly, and his deep black eyes revealed a faint smile.

“knew you couldn’t bear to let me wait for you all night.” The man smiled and said firmly.

It was as if he’d expected Qiao Mianmian to come out.

He opened the door and got out of the car. He then walked over and pulled her into his arms.

A familiar scent wafted over.

Qiao Mianmian leaned against his chest and wrapped her arms around his slender waist. “What if I didn’t come out, were you really going to wait outside the whole night? Would you be angry with me?”

“No.” In a good mood, Mo Yesi looked down at his wife and said, “I was the one who wanted to wait, how could I be angry with you? But now that you’re out, I’m very happy.

“This means that you can’t bear for me to really wait outside for the whole night.”

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t bear it.

Hence, she didn’t deny his words and said with a smile, “Then, I’m out now. You’ve seen me. Can I go back now?”

She then tried to push him away.

Mo Yesi grabbed her hand and kissed it. He opened the car door and said, “Not now, you have to eat supper with me. I haven’t eaten dinner, I’m so hungry now.”

“You didn’t eat dinner?” Qiao Mianmian frowned. “Why not?”

Mo Yesi picked her up horizontally and carried her to the front passenger seat. He bent down and kissed her cheek. “Without you around, I have no appetite. I can’t eat anything.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

The man sounded aggrieved.

“Now that you’re out, you should at least eat with me before going back. You can’t bear to see your husband go hungry, right?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

He was obviously acting pitiful.

Who said that only women would play tricks on such trivial matters?

Aman like Mo Yesi would too.

If she rejected him, wouldn’t she appear heartless?
