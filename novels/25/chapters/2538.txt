Chapter 2539: It Won’t Affect You If You Admit It

“What’s there to say? You’re just a child, what’s there to discuss with you? In any case, I’m doing this for the sake of the overall situation. If you still want our Shen family to be well, then obediently admit this matter.

“Anyway, you’re not a public figure. You’ll leave Yuncheng City after your vacation. It won’t affect you if you admit it. I’m very busy now and don’t have time to explain too much to you. If you have nothing else to say, I’ll hang up.” Shen Rou sounded a little impatient.

Tears rolled down Shen Xin’s cheeks.

She bit her lip and took a deep breath. “Sister, why do you think this doesn’t affect me? I have friends too. They’ll also see the reports.”

Otherwise, Keke wouldn’t have called her.

“Alright, alright, I got it.” Shen Rou sounded even more impatient now. She probably thought that this incident had made Shen Xin feel aggrieved, so she comforted her. “Xiao Xin, I’ve wronged you, but I have no choice.

“That’s all I can do.

“It won’t affect you too much.”

“If I admit it, our Shen Corporation will be finished. You don’t want to sleep on the streets, right? If I’m done, the Shen Corporation will be finished, so nothing can happen to me.

“Alright, I’m really busy now. If there’s anything, let’s talk at home. You can pick one of the latest C-brand bags for yourself. Consider it my compensation to you. That’s it, I’m hanging up.”

Shen Rou seemed really busy.

With that, she hung up.

Shen Xin stood in the corridor for a long time trying to understand everything.

Including all the scandals about Qiao Mianmian that Shen Rou got people to spread.

After reading it, Shen Xin struggled for a long time.

Shen Rou had gone overboard.

Even Shen Xin felt that she had gone overboard this time.

After the truth was exposed, Shen Rou was scolded like a dog. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Many netizens even called her to scold her.

The Shen Corporation’s share price was also affected by this.

But all the insults were directed at her.

Shen Xin saw many Weibo posts scolding her.

They were all wondering why Shen Rou was so kind and nice, but her sister was so vicious and scary.

It wasn’t difficult to find a person’s details in the Internet era.

Shen Xin’s cell phone number was even posted by a netizen who claimed to be her classmate.

It was posted a minute ago.

Then, less than a minute later, her cell phone rang.

An unknown number appeared on the screen.

Shen Xin listened to her cell phone ring for a while before pressing the call button.

“B*tch, you’re so shameless. You’re so young, yet you’re already so vicious. Who are you to defame Qiao Mianmian? Don’t think that you can escape all responsibility just because you’re young. Now that your cell phone number has been exposed, you can just wait to be scolded by the netizens.

“I heard you’re a student? Which school are you from? I’m going to report you! A student with such a dark and vicious heart should be expelled!”
