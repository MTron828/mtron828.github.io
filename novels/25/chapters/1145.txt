Chapter 1146: Did Sister-in-law Post It Behind Your Back?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Linda sounded calm enough.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t know if she was really calm. She thought for a while and said, “Yes, I just sent it. Sister Xie, I’m sorry, I didn’t abide by the contract. If you want to terminate the contract with me, then so be it.”

Mo Yesi looked up at her.

Linda remained silent for a while before letting out a helpless sigh. “What are you thinking? How could I terminate the contract with you because of this? I just want to know why you made such a decision all of a sudden. Did those rumors make CEO Mo unhappy?”

“Mm.” Qiao Mianmian felt that it was better to tell the truth. “Sister Xie, I thought about it seriously and think it’s better to make it public. I keep having scandals with others, and it’s not fair to my boyfriend. If I do, I can avoid a lot of trouble in the future.

“Young Master Gong and my boyfriend are very good friends. Isn’t it too disrespectful of my boyfriend to keep spreading rumors about us? If the company can’t accept me doing this, I can terminate the contract.

“It doesn’t matter even if I have to pay the penalty fee.”

As soon as Qiao Mianmian finished speaking, she felt a strong gaze on her.

On the other end of the phone, Linda was silent for a moment before saying, “Your considerations are not unreasonable. It will indeed avoid a lot of trouble if you publicize it. If people find out that your boyfriend is CEO Mo, no one will dare to defame you anymore.

“If you’re not an idol, public dating won’t affect you that much. But, Huanyu’s contract stipulates that you can’t be in a relationship for two years. If you do, you can’t publicize your relationship either. I don’t have the final say in the company’s regulations. How about this, I’ll go ask President Zhao. You can also appease President Mo. If there’s any problem, we’ll call him.”

Qiao Mianmian had just ended the call with Linda when Mo Yesi’s phone rang.

When he saw that it was Yan Shaoqing calling, he hesitated for a moment and suppressed the urge to ask Qiao Mianmian if she really wanted to make their relationship public. He pretended to be calm and answered the call.

The moment the call connected, Yan Shaoqing’s shocked voice could be heard. “Second Brother, are you and Sister-in-law finally going to make it public? Why did you suddenly decide to do it? No, that’s not right. You should have made it public a long time ago. Why did you only think of making it public now?”

Mo Yesi tightened his grip on the phone.

Even though he had heard from Qiao Mianmian and Linda’s conversation that she was going to make it public, he thought she was just thinking about it.

It didn’t have to be made public.

When he heard Yan Shaoqing’s words, he was stunned. A hint of surprise flashed in his eyes. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He took a deep breath, not wanting to appear too agitated. He tried his best to maintain his calm and asked, “What do you mean?”

“D*mn!” Yan Shaoqing exclaimed again. “Second Brother, don’t tell me you didn’t see Sister-in-law’s Weibo post?! Don’t tell me you don’t know that Sister-in-law posted it behind your back?

“Could it be that Sister-in-law wanted to make it public and not you?”

“Weibo?” Mo Yesi didn’t know about Qiao Mianmian’s Weibo post.

“That’s right. D*mn, looks like you really don’t know. What does Sis-in-law mean by this? She didn’t even discuss it with you beforehand?”
