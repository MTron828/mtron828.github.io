Chapter 2: Prepared a Gift for You

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The Presidential Suite floor.

The elevator opened.

A group of bodyguards and hotel employees escorted a good-looking man out.

The man had strong and cold features, and every part of his face was inexplicable perfection.

At a height of at least 1.86 meters, his stature and body proportion were better than that of a runway model!

He was wearing a tailormade, fitting suit, with a titanium cufflink that glistened splendidly under the chandelier.

The black suit encased his long legs as he strode elegantly and stopped before a room. A bodyguard then swiftly stepped forward to open the door.

The man entered the room, undid his tie and tossed it towards the wardrobe.

He was only two steps in when he felt an odd surge of warmth. Then, “click”—the door was locked from the outside.

He was a little caught by surprise and his brows were knitted. He reached for the knob and pulled it downwards.

It didn’t work.

The man’s expression darkened, and that was when his cell phone rang.

Caller ID: Yan Shaoqing.

He picked up and heard a cheeky male voice from the other end. “Second Bro, you’re back. We specially prepared a gift for you. Have you seen it? Do you like it?”

A hint of anger spread on his handsome face. He squinted and said coldly, “What are you doing?! Open the door.”

“Hehe, Second Bro, just focus on enjoying your beautiful woman. This time I found you one with a tip-top figure, looks, and everything you could think of. You’ll definitely be satisfied!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

With that, he hung up first.

When he tried to return the call, the other end was already not in service.

Mo Yesi stood outside the bathroom with a solemn look.

The sound of water could be heard from inside the bathroom. Someone was in there.

His lips were distorted at a strange, stiff angle. A moment later, he pushed the door open.

Thick clouds of mist escaped through the door. A woman was humming softly behind that white veil of water droplets, over and over again like a little kitten.

His feet were rooted.

As the mist dispersed, the scene became clearer to him.

There was a woman sitting in the bathroom.

She had a pretty face, her features exquisite, and her lips were a cherry blossom shade.

Her eyes were full of life and seemed to hold an entire galaxy—stunningly bright.

Even Mo Yesi, who was used to seeing belles and beauties all the time, was in awe for a moment.

This was the beautiful lady whom Yan Shaoqing and the rest gifted him?

She was beautiful indeed, but what a pity it was that even the most beautiful of women couldn’t spark his interest.

He watched for a short moment before speaking to her coldly, “Get out of there yourself. I’m giving you one minute to vanish from my room.”

The woman slowly looked up.

First she knitted her brows ever so slightly, then she looked at him. She reached her hand out.

When he did not respond to her, she grabbed his pants.

Mo Yesi froze as his muscles tensed up. He thought he might puke on the moment or feel an itch through his body. But even a while later, none of that happened.

Mo Yesi had the Anti-Women Disorder.

Besides his kin, no other woman could get close to him.

But in this moment he realized that he actually wasn’t repulsed by this woman.

His body wasn’t displaying any sort of unpleasant effects.

Mo Yesi lowered his head and looked at her. In the depths of his eyes were a hint of surprise.

Before he figured his thoughts out, the woman had already gotten off the floor and wrapped her arms around his neck. She tiptoed slightly and gave him a peck on his cool lips.

She looked up at him with those wide, soulful eyes and said, “Help me.”
