“So, if I didn’t meet you, I’d choose to be alone for the rest of my life.”

He would only have one soul mate in his life.

No one could replace her.

Qiao Mianmian was shocked by Mo Yesi’s words.

“If you hadn’t met me, you would have chosen... to spend the rest of your life alone?” She looked at the man’s handsome face in shock.

If this was said by someone else, she might not have believed it.

But Qiao Mianmian knew that he wasn’t lying to her.

This man had never lied to her.

Hence, if he hadn’t met her, he really planned to spend the rest of his life alone.

“Mm, so the only person who can accompany me for the rest of my life is you.”

Qiao Mianmian teared up. “But what’s so good about me? There are so many people better than me...”

“But they aren’t you. In my heart, you’re the best. No one can compare to you.” The man’s eyes were filled with ink, and his dark eyes were filled with her. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qiao Mianmian’s eyes widened. “Mo Yesi...”

Actually, she wasn’t as good as he thought.

She had many flaws, and compared to his excellence, she couldn’t be more ordinary.

She didn’t treat him too well, and her feelings for him couldn’t compare to his feelings for her.

“Thankfully, I met you.” The man’s warm and moist lips landed on hers. “So, I won’t be alone for the rest of my life. With you by my side, I have no regrets in this life.”

The news of Qiao Mianmian trying on the wedding dress was exposed.

A netizen who claimed to be in the know posted on Weibo that Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi’s wedding was about to take place. Mo Yesi had already gotten people to prepare for the wedding a year ago.

Sheng Sheng doesn’t mind: [Qiao Mianmian’s wedding dress is definitely the most dreamy and beautiful wedding dress I’ve ever seen. I heard that the wedding dress was personally designed by Mo Yesi. It took more than half a year before it was finally done. If it isn’t for the fact that I’m not allowed to put

pictures here, I really wanted to show you a picture of Qiao Mianmian in the wedding dress. Oh my god, it’s so beautiful. ]

Sheng Sheng doesn’t mind: [And do you know how much her wedding dress cost? You’ll be shocked!)

Once these two posts were published, they were quickly reposted by several marketing accounts.

The netizens were all excited and went to the comment section.

“Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi are having a wedding? I heard that they’re preparing for it. It’s finally going to be held. Speaking of which, they’ve been married for so long, it’s finally time for the wedding. Otherwise, the bride would feel aggrieved.”

“Wow, Mianbao and Chairman Mo’s wedding is finally going to be held. I heard that Mianbao was preparing for the wedding, but it actually took a year. After preparing for so long, how grand is the wedding going to be?”

“Tm the only one who noticed it. Did Mo Yesi design the wedding dress himself? Chairman Mo is so talented, how could he design a wedding dress?”

“Twant to know how much Chairman Mo spent on the wedding dress. We can’t upload the photos, but the price should be alright.”

“Twant to know the price of the wedding dress, too.”

“The wedding dress’ price is an eye-opener for us peasants..”
