Chapter 180: I Don’t Like Timid Women

He had his forehead against hers.

Tightening his arm around her, he said hoarsely, “I’ve taught you so many times, and you still haven’t learned to catch your breath? Looks like we’ve got to practice this more.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

The practices were frequent enough!

He kissed her each time he saw her.

He’d practically become a kiss-monster.

And he always did it for so long and so intensely, she felt like she could die from suffocation!

Upon hearing and watching them from the mirror, Uncle Li tried not to smile.

How nice.

It seemed like Young Master’s disorder had been cured completely.

Not only could he touch women, but he could also even get intimate with them.

It was all thanks to the Young Madam.

...

10 minutes later.

The black Rolls-Royce stopped outside a private clubhouse.

Mo Yesi got off and immediately reached for Qiao Mianmian’s hand.

Qiao Mianmian struggled a little and then felt he grabbing her hand a little more tightly.

Under the Manager’s lead, they walked into the clubhouse hand in hand.

He said to her while they were walking, “Third Yan and Shen Rou are already waiting for us in the private room.”

Qiao Mianmian was somewhat nervous.

All of them knew each other, all except her.

She had no idea whether she’d be disrupting them or causing any awkwardness by being around.

And those friends of his...

Although he told her not to mind them, how could she?

“Uh...” She bit her lip and tugged at his sleeve.

“Mm?” Mo Yesi looked down at her.

“You’re here to welcome your friend back. Shouldn’t we bring a gift for her?”

She didn’t feel good about going empty-handed. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“No need.” Mo Yesi casually said, “They’re not outsiders, we can do away with the civilities.”

The Manager stopped outside a private room.

...

Qiao Mianmian could hear a woman’s voice right away, “Third Yan, are you courting death!”

“Don’t, Miss Diva Shen! I won’t be able to bear your fist of steel!”

“Pfft, you’re the one with the fist of steel.”

...

“Where’s Second Bro? Should we call and ask why he isn’t here yet?”

“I texted him just now, he should be here soon. Oh right, Second Bro reminded us over and over again—we need to practice some restraint when Sis-in-law is here later. We can’t scare her off on our first meeting.”

“Hah.” Someone snorted a little mockingly. “He makes us sound so terrifying. If she’s so timid, he shouldn’t bring her here at all.”

“I don’t like timid women.”

“When did Ah Si start to like vulnerable and useless women like that?”

“Fourth Bro, you’d better keep these words here with us. Don’t you mention this before Second Bro and Sis-in-law. You know how Second Bro is like, he’d definitely turn against you if he knew you talked about his wife this way.”

“Hah.” The same man scoffed again. “If he wants to turn against us brothers over a woman he barely knows, then so be it.”

“Ze Li.” The woman’s voice could be heard again. “What you’re doing is no different, isn’t it—giving up an important person because of an unimportant person?”
