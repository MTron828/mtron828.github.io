The director praised her as he filmed. “Yes, that’s it. This angle is very good. Maintain this posture and don’t move. Alright, turn a little more to the right and face me.

“OK, this set is very good. It’s perfect.

“Now we’ll shoot the next set of scenes. Mianmian, get some water droplets on your face. I’ll zoom in and take a good shot of your face. Your skin is really too good. The camera is already so close, but there aren’t any flaws. I’ve filmed so many female artistes, but none of them are as good as you without makeup.

“Your camera sense is very good. Is this really your first time shooting an advertisement? You perform better than many experienced artistes.

“You’re really born to eat this bowl of rice. You’re amazing. You’ve given me too many surprises.”

During the shoot, the director kept praising Qiao Mianmian. He was very satisfied with her.

Qiao Mianmian had a high level of understanding.

She could express what the director wanted, and she did it well.

It was rare for the director to meet an artiste like her who understood what he meant with just one look. Naturally, he was pleasantly surprised and full of praises.

In contrast.

The director was especially calm with Qiao Anxin.

Qiao Anxin was an experienced artiste.

But compared to Qiao Mianmian, there wasn’t much of a surprise.

Qiao Anxin didn’t think much of it.

But compared to Qiao Mianmian, she felt extremely uncomfortable.

Qiao Mianmian was just a newbie and had no experience in acting.

She used to be a walk-on actor.

The director actually praised her.

As for her.

She entered the industry earlier than Qiao Mianmian and was more experienced than her.

The director didn’t comment on her.

After the shoot, Qiao Anxin couldn’t help but post on Weibo. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Qiao Anxin V: “No matter how hard I try, I can’t compare to her in terms of relationships. This world is really funny.”

With this post, the fans could naturally tell that she had suffered.

They asked her what happened.

Qiao Anxin picked a fan’s comment and replied: “It’s nothing much, I just feel a little disappointed. Sometimes, I think that doing well isn’t as good as being on good terms with others, so what’s the point of putting in so much effort? Sigh. Everyone doesn’t have to worry about me, I’m just sighing.”

The fans naturally didn’t think she was just casually sighing.

Their idol was so aggrieved that she posted it on Weibo. How could she just casually sigh?

Hence, the fans tried to find out the truth.

Soon, someone said, “Didn’t Xue Shiya post on Weibo that they signed Qiao Mianmian? She isn’t even a B-lister, but she can get the same endorsement as Anxin. Anxin must be unhappy about this.”

“It’s probably because of this. To be honest, Qiao Mianmian is really shameless. If she didn’t rely on her connections, would she have gotten so many good resources? Is this fair to the artistes who worked so hard to get these resources?”

“To put it bluntly, having connections is also a resource. Your parents have the money to buy you a luxurious house and a luxury car. They’ve arranged everything for you, are you going to reject them? Qiao Anxin’s acting is just average.”
