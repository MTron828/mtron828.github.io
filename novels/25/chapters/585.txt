Chapter 586: Mr. Su, She Said She’s Not Your Girlfriend

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The crowd was taken aback by his aura and slowly quietened down.

Su Ze was also stunned when he saw Gong Zeli.

He was very surprised.

He was stunned for a while before slowly standing up.

Su Ze knew Gong Zeli.

He was famous for his temperament in Yuncheng City. Nobody dared to mess with him.

Others referred to Su Ze as Young Master Su.

But in front of Gong Zeli, he was a nobody.

Thinking back to how Gong Zeli helped Qiao Mianmian earlier, he turned pale with fear and looked at her with a flurry of emotions.

Did she know Gong Zeli?

With Qiao Mianmian’s status, how could she have known Gong Zeli?

That Gong Zeli even spoke up for her.

What exactly was their relationship?

“So it’s Young Master Gong.” Su Ze couldn’t offend him. He politely replied, “Young Master Gong, you must be mistaken. I’m proposing to my girlfriend and not harassing a stranger.”

“Girlfriend?” Gong Zeli mocked.

It was fortunate that he was the one here today.

If it was Mo Yesi, Su Ze would be unable to bear the consequences.

“Miss Qiao, he said you are his girlfriend. Are you?” Gong Zeli ignored him and turned to ask Qiao Mianmian.

Qiao Mianmian frowned. Though she couldn’t guess what he was up to, she shook her head and replied, “No.”

Gong Zeli nodded.

“Mr. Su, she said she’s not your girlfriend.”

He was clearly amused. Seeing Gong Zeli smiling, Su Ze felt a chill run down his spine.

He stood up, his body full of sweat.

Su Ze froze and smiled unnaturally. “I made a mistake and she’s angry with me, so we’re fighting. I didn’t know that Young Master Gong knew Mianmian.”

As Gong Zeli was about to speak, Qiao Mianmian walked up. Bam! She slapped him.

Everyone around them was shocked.

Su Ze was also shocked by this slap.

Holding his face, he stared at Qiao Mianmian in disbelief.

He didn’t expect her to slap him again.

Qiao Mianmian glared at him and said, “Su Ze, it will no longer be a slap if you continue saying nonsense about our relationship in front of others. Qiao Anxin is my sister, and you were my fiancé. But you two were having an affair before we broke up.

“Do you expect me to forgive you after doing something so revolting?

“This is my last warning, don’t ever harass me again. I won’t be so polite next time.”

Qiao Mianmian turned and left.

Hearing what she said, the quiet crowd started to discuss among themselves.

No one spoke up for Su Ze.

Everyone looked at him with contempt.

“He cheated her with his sister-in-law. It’s no wonder the Young Lady did not forgive him.”

“He’s gone overboard. He even dared to cheat with his sister-in-law.”

“Wow, that’s horrid. I didn’t expect him to be such a scumbag.”
