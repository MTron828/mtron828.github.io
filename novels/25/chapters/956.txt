Chapter 957: Mianmian Is My Woman

Mo Yesi quickly understood what he meant.

The man was silent for a while before frowning.

At a time like this, he naturally hoped to help Qiao Mianmian settle things in the name of the Mo Corporation.

That way, the people behind the scenes would be afraid of her.

No one would dare to touch her again.

He hoped that he could stand by her side as her husband and protect her.

But he’d promised her.

Before she graduated, their relationship couldn’t be exposed for the next two years.

No matter how unwilling he was, he had to fulfill his promise.

“Then, don’t use the corporation’s name. Contact Huan Yu and get them to send a lawyer’s letter. If they ask about Mianmian’s relationship with the Mo Corporation, tell them that Mianmian is my woman.”

He just agreed not to disclose his relationship with Qiao Mianmian.

It didn’t mean that he had to hide their relationship in private.

If necessary, it would only benefit her if her management agency knew who she was relying on.

It’d make her management company value her more. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The reason why Huan Yu hadn’t responded up till now was probably that they were considering whether they should spend energy and money on a newbie.

...

Wei Zheng quickly went to settle Mo Yesi’s instructions.

In less than an hour, Mo Corporation’s public relations department had removed all of Qiao Mianmian’s trending topics.

The related topics were also deleted.

The fake reviewers commenting on the comment section were quickly replaced by a new group of fake reviewers.

At the same time, the official Weibo accounts and verified accounts deleted the reposts.

Even the “insider” Weibo account was deleted.

A while later, some netizens realized that not only had the “insider” Weibo account been deleted, but this person had also been banned.

As for the other netizens, they quickly realized that they couldn’t find anything when they searched for “Qiao Mianmian” and “Tu Yilei”.

These two names became sensitive words.

In less than an hour.

All negative topics about Qiao Mianmian vanished completely.

It was as if the news about her was just an illusion.

The netizens were shocked.

They all said: What the f*ck, what’s going on? The sugar daddy is finally making a move? Which big shot is this? He’s too awesome.

Tu Yilei’s fans were even more enraged when they saw that the related topics had been removed and even Qiao Mianmian’s name was banned.

But this time, no matter how many topics the fans talked about, they couldn’t get on the trending list.

The enraged fans saw that the Weibo post wasn’t successful. Someone had organized a team and said that they wanted an explanation from Huan Yu. They couldn’t let Qiao Mianmian off so easily.

As one of the main characters, Tu Yilei was silent for a few hours before posting on Weibo.

On Weibo, it confirmed that the “insider” was speaking the truth.

He was injured and couldn’t continue working, so he decided to study abroad for a year while recuperating.

But he denied that Qiao Mianmian didn’t care about him after the incident.
