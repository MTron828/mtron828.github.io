Chapter 165: My Baby Has Me to Love Her

He looked up at Qiao Mianmian as if she was something terribly grotesque. “Sinner, what are you still doing here!

“Your Aunt Lin and Anxin are already in this state, are you still not satisfied? Do you want someone to beat me up too?

“Leave right now! I don’t want to see you ever again. Don’t you come back here. I don’t have a daughter like you.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Qiao Mianmian’s hand was still clenched.

She took a deep breath and looked up with her slightly pale face. She was about to say something when she felt a hand on her shoulder.

She turned around, only to be pulled into an embrace.

Mo Yesi hugged her and placed his huge hand on her head to comfort her. “Baby, we should leave indeed. There’s no need to spend any more time in this terrible place.”

The man’s embrace was warm.

And the hand on her head felt calming and secure.

She felt nice and warm from his touch, all the way to her heart.

Qiao Mianmian felt as if she’d been healed by this hug.

Although she was still hurt, she was much better than just a while ago.

Mo Yesi then turned around and his tender eyes went cold again.

One could almost feel the cold fog emanated from his eyes.

He glared at Qiao Ruhai and Qiao Anxin, then smiled and said quietly, “Qiao Ruhai, I’m being a little respectful to you only because you are Mianmian’s father.

“But since you put my Baby through so much hurt, then I don’t think you deserve this bit of respect anymore. Listen up, Aunt Qiao’s bedroom will be reverted back to its original state from now on. My Baby says no one is to move into this room, and that’s that.

“I’ve already made myself clear. If you insist on going against me, trust me, you definitely aren’t able to bear the consequences.

“This is just a warning. If there’s a next time, things won’t be so simple anymore.

“And.” He looked down at her with some gentleness in his eyes. “My Baby has me to love her and care for her. She’s a wonderful person, you really aren’t worthy to be her father.

“Since you’ve already said that you don’t have a daughter like her, then let’s settle this severing of ties clearly.”

On this note, Mo Yesi smirked and faced Qiao Ruhai’s burning eyes. “I will get my lawyer to send you the detailed agreement for the severing of ties tomorrow.”

Qiao Ruhai was shocked and angered. “Who exactly are you! This is my family business, you’re just an outsider. It’s not in your place to care!”

Mo Yesi chuckled insincerely. “It’s best you don’t know who I am. But just know that everything involving Qiao Mianmian from now on, I will have a hand in it, and I will oversee it entirely. Anyone who dares to make her feel aggrieved again—anyone at all—I will not let them go.”

The man’s voice wasn’t loud, but every word of his carried a huge weight.
