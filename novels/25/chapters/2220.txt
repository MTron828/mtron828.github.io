Chapter 2223: Treat Her Very politely

She fell asleep before he could dry her hair.

Mo Yesi waited patiently for more than half an hour. After confirming that her hair was completely dry, he turned off the hairdryer and carried her horizontally.

He placed Qiao Mianmian on the bed gently and then pulled the blanket over her.

Her hair was soft and fluffy.

Mo Yesi sat by the bed and looked at the sleeping girl. Recalling what she said to him just now, he couldn’t help but lower his head and kiss her soft and fragrant lips.

He then reached out and caressed her slightly red face. “Mianmian, remember what you said. You have to be my wife in your next life.”

…

The next day.

Qiao Mianmian got up early in the morning and went to look for Linda. After getting her styling done, the two of them rushed to the location.

The promotion for “If You Can’t Love” would invite all the well-known media reporters in Yuncheng City.

As the male lead, Qin Han arrived on time.

There were also two main supporting actors and actresses. When everyone arrived, the promotion would begin on time.

Qiao Mianmian felt that the actors, crew members, and reporters were all very polite to her.

They used to be polite.

But this time, they were especially so.

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t surprised. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

After all, her identity as the daughter of the Bai family had been exposed.

This identity was even more important than her status as Mo Yesi’s girlfriend.

After all, he might break up with her.

But you couldn’t change your bloodline.

And looking at how much Bai Yusheng valued her, these people could tell that the Bai family definitely doted on her.

Who wouldn’t want to please the daughter of the Bai family?

Who would dare to provoke her?

Hence, during the interview segment, the reporters’ questions became especially “gentle.”

No one dared to make things difficult for her like before.

“Miss Qiao, many people praised your acting skills after watching the clip. They felt that as a newbie, you performed very well. Then, what do you think of your performance in the drama? If you could score your acting skills, how many points would you give yourself?”

“Score my acting?”

“Yes.”

“What’s the full score?”

“100 points.”

Qiao Mianmian tilted her head and thought about it seriously. Then, she smiled and said, “Then, I’d give myself 60 points. I think my acting skills are passable. As for the rest, I’ll leave it to the audience to score after the drama starts airing.”

“60 points? Miss Qiao is really humble.” The reporter smiled and turned to Bai Yusheng, who was sitting beside Qiao Mianmian. “Director Bai, I heard that you personally picked Miss Qiao as the female lead. How many points do you give her?”

Bai Yusheng turned to look at Qiao Mianmian and took the microphone from her.
