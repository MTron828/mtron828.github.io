Chapter 1086: That’s Too Fast

No matter how pure Mo Shixiu was, he was still a normal man.

Besides, he was interested in Jiang Luoli.

How could he withstand her teasing?

His body had already reacted, and the desire to have her was strong. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

He had been holding back.

For a moment, he wanted to indulge himself again.

Anyway, she was the one who provoked him.

But in the end, reason overcame impulse and he endured it.

Before things were clear, he couldn’t touch her again.

He was impulsive that night and was more or less affected by the drug.

But he was sober now. If he touched her under such circumstances, he would really take advantage of her.

“Jiang Luoli, you’re drunk. You don’t even know what you are doing.” Mo Shixiu’s face was tense. He grabbed her other hand that was still making trouble and got off her body quickly.

As soon as he released his hand, Jiang Luoli reached out to him and said unhappily, “Darling, don’t go. Come back, I want to hug and kiss you...”

After Mo Shixiu got off the bed, he immediately turned around and walked out of the bedroom.

His steps were hurried and fast as if someone was chasing him.

There was no hesitation, nor did he turn around.

When he walked out of the bedroom, he could still hear the girl crying and throwing a tantrum.

He frowned and stood outside the bedroom for a while, tidying up his clothes and hair. After making sure that there was nothing wrong, he turned and walked down the stairs.

When he reached downstairs, Sister Lin saw him coming down from upstairs. She looked at him in surprise, and then a hint of worry appeared in her eyes.

No way.

Mister had a good body.

It couldn’t have ended so quickly, could it?

It had only been a few minutes...

This was too fast.

Mister was almost perfect in every aspect. If something happened to this man’s most important matter, it would be a huge blow.

“Mister, you, why did you come down so quickly?” Sister Lin was too shocked and couldn’t help but ask the question in her mind.

As soon as she did so, she realized her mistake.

This incident must have been a huge blow to Mister. He was already feeling bad enough.

If she still asked, wouldn’t it be a greater blow to him?

Sister Lin immediately regretted it.

She wanted to say something to make up for it, but she couldn’t think of what to say.

“Sir, I— I didn’t mean that.” Her face was flushed with anxiety.” I— I just—”

Mo Shixiu didn’t expect Sister Lin to have so many thoughts. He thought of the little girl upstairs and frowned with a headache. “Sister Lin, bring the hangover soup upstairs and feed it to her. She’s drunk and her mood is unstable now. Stay in her bedroom and take care of her.

“You can leave when she’s asleep.”

Sister Lin was stunned. “Mister, what about you?”

Mo Shixiu rubbed the space between his eyebrows. “I’m going to the study to deal with something. Anyway, keep an eye on her. If anything happens, come find me in the study.”

After saying that, he turned around and left.

Sister Lin watched as he walked upstairs. His tall and straight back seemed to exude a hint of loneliness, and her eyes revealed a hint of worry once again.

Mister was so shocked that he didn’t want to face Miss Jiang anymore...
