Chapter 755: Baby, What Does It Have to Do With Me?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

He turned around and looked at Nana.

“It wasn’t me.” Nana immediately shook her head.

“Mo Yesi, it’s all your fault.” Qiao Mianmian kicked the man lightly.

“My fault?”

Mo Yesi looked away innocently. “Baby, what has it got to do with me?”

He recalled that he hadn’t done anything to anger her this morning.

How did it become his fault?

Qiao Mianmian wanted to kick him again. She glared at him. “Of course it has to do with you. How could you...”

When she saw Nana standing behind them, she bit her lip and glared at him. “Anyway, it’s your fault. You’re so annoying.”

Mo Yesi was speechless.

A woman’s heart was like a needle in a haystack.

He really didn’t know what he’d done wrong.

Was it because of that kiss?

But didn’t she respond to him? This meant that she liked him.

“Ahem. Sister Mianmian, Mr. Mo, I’ll go and have breakfast first. Sister Mianmian, I’ll look for you when we get to the set later.” Nana quickly glanced at Mo Yesi, and her cheeks got even redder.

Mr. Mo was really handsome.

And those legs were too long.

At first glance, he was practically bursting with desire.

She looked so pure and innocent.

But last night...

She’d heard him make Sister Mianmian cry.

And he’d done it several times.

It was a long time each time.

Although she hadn’t counted it, it was at least three times.

She really couldn’t tell that a man who looked abstinent like him... would be so crazy in bed.

She couldn’t resist it at all.

It was obvious that he was obsessed with her.

Could it be that this man who looked abstinent and didn’t like to get close to women was actually...

A slender figure suddenly appeared in her mind.

That person was always so insipid.

It was as if he had seen through the mortal world and lost all his desires.

She suddenly wondered how that person would look if he had a woman he liked.

Was his heart pure and unapproachable only in front of women he didn’t like?

Did he have the same warm and proactive side as Mr. Mo?

What would he look like when he was passionate? Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The more she thought about it, the more her heart raced.

“Mo Yesi, look at what you’ve done.”

After Nana left, Qiao Mianmian pointed at the hickeys on her neck and said angrily, “You’ve got so many on my neck... How am I supposed to go out today.”

Mo Yesi saw the hickeys on her neck and realized why she lost her temper.

He kept quiet for a while before suggesting seriously. “Then, don’t go to the set today. I’ll give Bai Yusheng a call and ask for leave.”

This serious proposal made Qiao Mianmian even more upset. “How many days are you planning to treat me to?”

Mo Yesi thought about it seriously and then said, “I don’t think it’ll last a day. Three days? Just take it as a vacation and come back with me today. I’ll send you over next time.”

He did it on purpose.

Of course, he knew that he couldn’t leave a kiss mark on her neck.
