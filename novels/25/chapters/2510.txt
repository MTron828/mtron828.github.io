Chapter 2511: She Won’t Be Soft-Hearted Again

“You feel aggrieved?” Gong Zeli’s cold voice reached her ears. He suddenly sneered. When he spoke again, his voice was so cold that Shen Rou couldn’t help but shiver.

“Shen Rou, do you think I don’t know the despicable things you did behind my back? You asked for it. You don’t have to pretend to be aggrieved. Remember, you deserve all of this.

“Also, since you took the initiative to call me, it saves me the trouble of finding someone to inform you. In the future, the Gong Corporation will definitely compete for your Shen Corporation’s business. From this moment on, I declare that we’re officially enemies.”

“What did you say?” Shen Rou widened her eyes in disbelief. “Gong Zeli, you’re doing this to me?! For what, just for Qiao Mianmian?”

“Yes, just for her.” Gong Zeli didn’t hide his feelings anymore.

“You really fell in love with her?”

Shen Rou was a little excited. She didn’t expect Gong Zeli to admit that he was doing this for Qiao Mianmian.

Although she was angry, she was even more excited to have her way.

She had recorded this call from the start.

She no longer had any hopes for Gong Zeli.

From the moment he posted on Weibo, they were destined to be enemies.

He didn’t care about her because of Qiao Mianmian. He obviously didn’t have any feelings for her anymore.

Then, she wouldn’t be soft-hearted anymore.

From then on, she and Gong Zeli were true enemies.

She had never really liked him.

She just felt that he was pretty good and treated her well. Being protected by a man like this made her feel very satisfied.

Then, the Shen family was forced into a dead end.

She was forced to go on blind dates.

After seeing so many people, she realized how outstanding he was. Thinking about their past, she started to like him.

If Gong Zeli was willing to accept her, she would be happy to marry him and be with him.

But if he chose to be her enemy. So be it.

He was heartless to her, so he couldn’t blame her for being mean to him.

Gong Zeli didn’t answer her immediately. Their conversation went silent.

Shen Rou waited for a while, but he didn’t reply. She couldn’t help but say, “Gong Zeli, say something. Are you in love with Qiao Mianmian?”

“Shen Rou, are you recording this call?” Gong Zeli sounded dangerous.

Shen Rou’s expression changed as she gripped her cell phone tightly. “I’m not. Gong Zeli, I’m not as dirty as you think.”

“Really? I think you’re dirtier than I thought.”

“Gong Zeli, you…”

“Do you know what it means to be too smart for your own good? Do you think I don’t know your tricks?” Gong Zeli sneered. “Shen Rou, I’ve always been too good to you. So, you don’t seem to know the consequences of angering me? You don’t really know what kind of person I am.”

Gong Zeli spoke calmly, but Shen Rou suddenly shivered.

She suddenly felt fear.

“Gong Zeli, w-what do you mean? Are you threatening me?”

“Threatening?” Gong Zeli laughed again, but the coldness in his voice was even more terrifying than before. “No, you’re wrong. This isn’t a threat. I’m just informing you in advance. I’ll let you know what kind of person I am.”

With that, Gong Zeli hung up.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m
