Chapter 2846: A Little Afraid

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Wow, now that I think about it, Gong Zeli is so devoted. Qiao Mianmian is already married, but he still can’t let her go. Qiao Mianmian is too amazing. She can make two such outstanding men fall head over heels for her. Ahhh, when is she going to publish a book? I really want to learn from her how to flirt with Prince Charming.”

Qiao Mianmian couldn’t help but frown when she saw that people were discussing her and Gong Zeli.

She knew it.

Once others found out that Qiao Anxin’s contract termination was related to her, her scandal with Gong Zeli would spread again.

She deliberately avoided him because she hoped that there wouldn’t be any scandals between them.

She was already married.

It wasn’t appropriate to be involved in a scandal with another man.

Moreover, the person involved was Mo Yesi’s good buddy.

What would others think of him?

Even if she didn’t care about her reputation, she still cared about what others thought of Mo Yesi.

But Qiao Mianmian couldn’t get someone to delete those comments now.

If she did, it would be too deliberate. It would make it seem like there was something between her and Gong Zeli.

Only a few people were discussing her and Gong Zeli in the comment section. These comments should disappear soon.

Qiao Mianmian thought for a while and decided to pretend not to see it.

…

Since she was going to stay, Qiao Mianmian went to meet up with the others after washing up.

After she walked out of her room, the other guests on the same floor also came out.

Qiao Mianmian greeted them.

She wasn’t sure if she was hallucinating, but she felt that they were especially polite to her.

They had been polite before, but today they were even more polite. It was as if they were afraid.

Especially Xu Min’er.

The way she addressed her was almost respectful.

Qiao Mianmian found it strange at first, but she quickly understood the reason.

They probably already knew that Jiang Xinyue was removed by the production team, and they definitely knew that she was involved.

It wasn’t easy for Xu Min’er and the rest to get a spot in this episode.

She was afraid of offending Qiao Mianmian and becoming a second Jiang Xinyue.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t ask the production team to remove Jiang Xinyue, but it was definitely related to her.

Hence, she couldn’t be bothered to explain.

Li Wei also walked over. He had a friendly smile on his face as he greeted everyone.

“Good morning, everyone. I have something to announce. The production team has decided to replace Jiang Xinyue for some reasons. The new guest is still on the way, but don’t worry, it won’t affect the shoot.

“We’re still filming normally today. Everyone, have breakfast first. After breakfast, the staff will give you today’s mission forms.”

Li Wei then got the crew to bring the guests for breakfast.

Zhan Bo leaned towards Qiao Mianmian and asked in a low voice, “Qiao Mianmian, was Jiang Xinyue removed because of you? I saw that everyone on Weibo was saying that she offended you and was removed by the production team.”

Zhan Bo wanted to hear the gossip.

Qiao Mianmian turned to look at him and raised an eyebrow. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“She really offended you? What did she do?” Zhan Bo continued to gossip.

Of course, Qiao Mianmian wouldn’t tell him the real reason.

Instead, she teased him. “Are you so concerned about her? Why? Are you reluctant to let her go?”

Zhan Bo looked as if he’d just swallowed a fly.
