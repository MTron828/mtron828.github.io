Even Qiao Chen was a little afraid of his brother-in-law at first. It was only after spending more time with him that he really treated him as his brother-in-law.

“There’s no need. You and Mr. Mo can go and eat. Don’t bother about us. We’ll just eat something in the car later.” The crew member in charge of Qiao Mianmian waved her hand in embarrassment.

“That won’t do.” Qiao Mianmian immediately called a housemaid over. “The kitchen has already prepared the food. It’d be a waste if you don’t eat. It’s just breakfast, no need to be polite. You’ll have the energy to work after eating.”

“This...” The leader hesitated. “But we still have to...”

“You have to record me, right? You can fix the camera and aim it at me.” Qiao Mianmian walked towards a staff member who was pointing his cell phone at her. She greeted the camera and smiled. “This is a live stream, right? Hi, is there anyone in the live stream now? Good morning, everyone. I’m Qiao Mianmian. I’m going to have breakfast now. Have you all eaten?”

Qiao Mianmian was very close to the camera when she greeted him.

Her magnified face appeared in the live stream.

She went downstairs after washing up, so she didn’t have any skincare or makeup on.

Not only was she bare-faced, but the camera didn’t have any filters on. It was streaming in raw quality.

Barefaced and no filters.

This was something many girls wouldn’t consider.

Even the female celebrities who claimed to have good skin and good looks wouldn’t do a live stream.

Not to mention...

Qiao Mianmian was so close to the camera just now.

At that distance, even the pores on her face could be seen clearly. If there were any flaws on her face, they would definitely be seen clearly.

But at that moment, the netizens in the live stream didn’t see even a single flaw on Qiao Mianmian’s face.

What they saw was a porcelain-white face. The girl’s skin was soft and fair, as delicate as a peeled egg.

Because of her fair skin, any slight flaw on her face would be very obvious.

No matter how good a person’s skin was, it was hard to tell from a distance. But if one looked closer, some flaws would appear.

But Qiao Mianmian wasn’t an ordinary person.

Someone took a screenshot of the scene and zoomed in a few times, but they couldn’t find any flaws on her face.

“Damn, Qiao Mianmian’s skin is too good. She can beat any female artiste in the entertainment industry with her bare face.”

“Oh my, does such good skin really exist? She didn’t use a filter, right? Is that her skin under the original camera? Qiao Mianmian has the best bare skin among all the female artistes in the entertainment industry. No one refutes that, right?”

“Her looks are really good. I don’t think any female artiste can compare to her.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The live stream was filled with praises and envy.

But there were also many sour lemons.

“Haha, what’s there to be shocked about? If I could marry such a rich husband and be a rich wife, I could also take care of myself and be like an 18-year-old girl.”
