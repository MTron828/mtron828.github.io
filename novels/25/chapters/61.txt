Chapter 62: Kowtow and Apologize to Me Right Away

“What?” Jiang Luoli was stunned for a moment. “Well, Shen Yueyue said it. She came back to school and happily told all of us that you’d cheated on him, so Young Master Su didn’t want you anymore.”

Qiao Mianmian said, “... I didn’t cheat on him.”

Damn him.

That jerk and that cheap woman were the ones who cheated on her!

“Baby, of course I believe you.” Jiang Luoli frowned slightly. “Don’t I know what sort of person you are? Shen Yueyue is too mean. She’s wrecking your reputation on purpose. Back then it was Xu Jiekai who fell in love with you at first sight and pursued you, you didn’t seduce him or anything. How could Shen Yueyue feel that you stole her man?”

Qiao Mianmian did not respond.

She felt that it wasn’t Shen Yueyue who was behind this, but someone else.

Shen Yueyue would never tell others about their breakup, much less explain it.

Hence, the only possibility was that Qiao Anxin spread the word.

She deliberately let Shen Yueyue know about this, with obvious intentions.

On that thought, Qiao Mianmian’s eyes went cold.

Qiao Anxin...

Footsteps could be heard approaching.

Jiang Luoli widened her eyes in fear. “Mianmian, they’re coming up.”

Qiao Mianmian slowly looked up and saw Shen Yueyue and Zhao Wanting before her, leading eight young men behind them.

Shen Yueyue had her chin tipped up like a proud peacock as she strutted towards Qiao Mianmian.

“Qiao Mianmian, if you kneel before me and kowtow three times, and then give a formal apology through the school broadcast system, I might consider forgiving you this time.”

“That’s right!” Zhao Wanting added on proudly. “Kowtow and apologize to us right away. If your attitude is good, we’ll let you off this time. Otherwise, just wait to get beaten up.”

“The both of you are too much.”

Jiang Luoli said furiously, “You people are the ones bullying others, why should Mianmian apologize to you.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Jiang Luoli, shut up! If you help Qiao Mianmian, then don’t blame us for roping you into the punishment.”

“You...”

“Luo Luo, this has nothing to do with you.” Qiao Mianmian pulled Jiang Luoli behind her. She then looked coldly at the arrogant people in front of her. “Kneel down before you? I only kneel before my parents and the deities, who are you?

“You’re the ones who offended me. I taught you a lesson, but that’s because you deserved it. Apologize? Ha, not in this life.”

“You...”

Shen Yueyue turned pale from anger. “Qiao Mianmian, you’re saying you won’t apologize?”

Qiao Mianmian looked at her like she was a fool. “Didn’t I already say that? You’re so young, but your hearing is terrible. Shen Yueyue, I suggest you get a check-up at the hospital, just in case you’re going deaf.”

“Bitch!”

There were a number of people watching their confrontation.

The moment Qiao Mianmian said those words, the crowd burst into laughter.

They were mocking Shen Yueyue.

Shen Yueyue felt utter embarrassment and raised her arm, all ready to slap Qiao Mianmian.

Qiao Mianmian did not evade. She simply sneered. “Why, you want to fall again?”
