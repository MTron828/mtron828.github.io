Chapter 1524: His Expression Suddenly Changed

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Compared to some female celebrities who accompanied old men for resources, Qiao Mianmian was simply enviable.

Her ex-boyfriend was the president of Star Splendor. After breaking up with him, she found a rich and handsome boyfriend.

Given her boyfriend’s looks, even if he did something indecent, many people would willingly come to him.

Anyone who wasn’t a fool would choose the latter.

“Mianmian, where did you find such a handsome boyfriend? Can you tell us your secret?”

A group of girls surrounded Qiao Mianmian and giggled.

It was true that they were envious and wanted such a handsome boyfriend.

But asking Qiao Mianmian to help them was a joke.

Before coming into contact with Qiao Mianmian, they thought that she wasn’t easy to get along with because of the negative news.

But after interacting with her and finding out that she had a good temper, these female employees all liked her.

They got along well.

They had interacted with Qiao Anxin before.

Qiao Anxin was a big shot. Even though she wasn’t as popular as before because of the scandals, she still put on airs.

She had to drink the water from a designated brand. As long as it wasn’t that brand, she wouldn’t drink it.

If she wanted to stay in a hotel, she had to stay in a presidential suite.

In any case, all standards were the highest.

On the other hand, Qiao Mianmian didn’t have any special requests.

She would cooperate with the crew.

She was so much easier to get along with than Qiao Anxin.

They didn’t know what the company thought at that time. They wanted Qiao Anxin to be their spokesperson.

Qiao Anxin’s reputation was no longer as good as before.

She was just an A-lister, but in fact, she was no longer an A-lister.

If she didn’t produce a good show to stabilize her popularity, her popularity would fall even faster in the future.

It was obvious from the sales volume.

Her sales were even worse than Qiao Mianmian’s.

But they heard that Qiao Anxin got Xue Shiya’s endorsement because of someone else.

With the endorsement she got from accompanying the old man, her results weren’t too good now. She was probably anxious too. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

...

The shoot ended at 6 PM.

After work, Qiao Mianmian went to look for Mo Yesi.

The man was working in the study room. When Qiao Mianmian went over, she saw him holding a video conference.

Qiao Mianmian pushed the door lightly.

When she heard that Mo Yesi was in a meeting, her footsteps became very soft.

She wanted to wait for Mo Yesi to finish his meeting.

Who knew that even though she was so silent, the man in the meeting still saw her.

At the desk.

The man was wearing a white shirt with his sleeves rolled up, and his collarbones could be seen. His handsome face was expressionless, but when his eyes landed on Qiao Mianmian, his dark eyes were filled with warmth.

Qiao Mianmian met his gaze and felt the gentleness in his eyes. She smiled sweetly at him.

Mo Yesi smiled too.

The meeting was still ongoing.

In the Mo Corporation’s meeting room, on the projector.

The senior executives had just been reprimanded and were trembling in fear when they saw Chairman Mo’s expression change.
