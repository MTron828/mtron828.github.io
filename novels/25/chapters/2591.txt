Chapter 2593: I Can’t Help You This Time

“Why is that slut Qiao Mianmian so lucky? Why!” Little Xiao’s face was pale. She almost had a heart attack from scrolling through Weibo. She waved her hand and swept the red wine bottle on the table to the ground. Even after seeing a bottle of wine worth fifty to sixty thousand yuan being smashed on the ground, she still felt that it wasn’t enough to vent her anger.

She then smashed a vase.

There was a crackling sound.

The floor was a mess.

“B*tch, b*tch, Qiao Mianmian, you b*tch.” At this time, Little Xiao seemed to have gone crazy. If her fans saw her now, they would probably be shocked.

Just as she was gritting her teeth and thinking about how to retaliate, her cell phone rang.

The ringing was urgent.

Little Xiao walked over and looked down.

Seeing that it was her manager, she took a deep breath and picked up her cell phone.

“Sister Aisha.”

“Little Xiao, didn’t I tell you to apologize to Qiao Mianmian? Then, perhaps you’d still have a chance? But what did you do? Why did you anger her again? I can’t help you this time.”

Little Xiao panicked and quickly said, “Sister Aisha, I-I’ve already apologized to her. I heard what you said and apologized to her on Weibo. I didn’t anger her.”

Aisha was Little Xiao’s manager.

She’d been with her since she was a newbie.

It could be said that Aisha had brought her to where she was today.

Hence, Little Xiao was very dependent on her. This time, when something happened, she kept begging Aisha to help her think of a way.

She was in trouble. Moreover, she offended someone she shouldn’t have. It would be very difficult to solve the trouble she had caused.

But she was the one who groomed her, after all.

And Little Xiao was the company’s money tree.

If she was really blacklisted, it would affect the company and her as a manager.

Hence, Aisha tried her best to think of a solution for her. She hoped that she could keep this money tree that she’d groomed.

“I’ve seen your Weibo post. You did apologize, but what did you say at the end? Little Xiao, don’t tell me you didn’t mean anything else. How can I not know what you’re thinking? Do you want people to think that Qiao Mianmian forced you to leave the entertainment industry? Do you think your little tricks can bring you benefits? Stupid, really stupid. Now that you’ve caused this trouble, I won’t clean up your mess. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Don’t even think about staying in the entertainment industry anymore. Just resign to fate and leave.

“I wanted to protect you this time on account of our many years of friendship. But since you did such a stupid thing, I can’t protect you anymore. We’ve worked together for so many years, I’ll apply for a severance fee from the company. This is the last thing I can do for you as your manager.”

“Sister Aisha, I…”

“That’s it. Are you going to get your own things from the company, or should I get someone to send them to your apartment?”

Little Xiao’s face was pale.

Her manager was her last hope.

If even her manager gave up on her, then she really had no hope of staying in the entertainment industry..
