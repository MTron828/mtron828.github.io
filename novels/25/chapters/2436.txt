Chapter 2439: That’s It

They booked a VIP room upstairs.

The boss knew Mo Yesi’s identity and led the two of them up respectfully. The private room was in the best spot, leaning against the window. They could eat hot pot while watching the snow outside.

It was snowing harder now.

“Mr. Mo, Miss Qiao, please wait for a while. I’ll prepare it for you immediately.”

The boss turned around and left.

Not long after, a waiter came in with a bright red pot. Qiao Mianmian ordered a yogurt pot. The pot was boiled and the yogurt melted. The rich and spicy fragrance entered Qiao Mianmian’s nose, and she couldn’t help but swallow.

This fragrance was too tempting.

Qiao Mianmian loved hot pot and was a foodie in this aspect.

She had eaten so much hot pot that she had gained experience and skill.

Hence, just by smelling the bottom of the pot, she could basically tell if it was delicious or not.

Yan Shaoqing was indeed an expert in food and entertainment.

The hot pot restaurant he recommended was very good. The bottom of the pot was made with very thick pure beef oil. Just by smelling it, one could tell that it was definitely very delicious.

The waiter handed her the menu.

She ordered a bunch of her favorite dishes.

Three portions of beef tripes and three portions of beef.

She decided to have a good time.

She handed the menu to the waiter after ordering a bunch of dishes.

She didn’t ask Mo Yesi what he liked.

He didn’t seem to like anything, anyway.

She thought that when they were done eating, she could accompany him to eat something else, or she could cook supper for him. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Mo Yesi was very picky.

Especially picky when it came to food.

But he gave her face.

If it was her cooking, he would eat it up and praise her for it.

“You ordered so much, can you finish it?” Mo Yesi asked with a smile.

“I can finish it!” Qiao Mianmian rubbed her belly and looked confident. “I think I can eat a cow right now. This restaurant Shaoqing recommended is really good. This pot base is very authentic.

“Let me tell you, you have to eat the bottom of the beef pot. The clear oil isn’t fragrant or authentic at all. Only the bottom of the beef pot can be considered a real hot pot,” Qiao Mianmian explained to him.

Mo Yesi didn’t like hot pot and wasn’t interested in it at all. But he still accepted Qiao Mianmian’s recommendation and nodded. “Mm, I understand. Shaoqing isn’t good at other things, but he’s good at eating, drinking, and playing. So, if you want to eat or play in the future, you can ask him.

“He can give the best advice.”

Yan Shaoqing had always been useless in Mo Yesi’s eyes.

But now, he realized that he was still useful.

At least when he wanted to please his wife, he could get some useful advice from that guy.

Of course, Yan Shaoqing was only so useful to him.

…

Qiao Mianmian enjoyed the hot pot.

Because Mo Yesi didn’t eat much, she was the only one eating.

Perhaps she hadn’t eaten hot pot for too long.

Qiao Mianmian’s fighting spirit was amazing. By the time she finished eating, there wasn’t much left of the dishes she ordered.
