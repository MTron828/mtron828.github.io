Chapter 1260: Why Should She Worry About Not Having a Chance in the Future

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Sister, what do you mean?” Qiao Anxin pretended not to understand.

“You know what I mean.” Qiao Mianmian held back her anger. “Why are you here, and you’re Aunt Bai’s daughter. You...”

Qiao Anxin raised her hand and interrupted her. “Sister, don’t worry. I’ll explain it to you slowly. But it’s a long story, so let’s go in first. Uncle Zhao has prepared tea.”

Qiao Mianmian frowned at her.

Qiao Anxin looked at her smilingly.

After a while, Qiao Mianmian took a deep breath and nodded. “Alright, let’s talk inside.”

Qiao Anxin quickly glanced at Mo Yesi.

Looking at the man’s tall figure and handsome face, her heart pounded wildly.

Mo Yesi.

The Second Young Master of the Mo family, Mo Yesi, one of the four richest families in Yuncheng City.

From the first time she saw him, she knew that his identity was extraordinary.

But she never expected his true identity to be so distinguished.

How could there be such a perfect man in this world? Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

This man seemed to be tailor-made for her.

He fulfilled all her requirements.

Unfortunately...

Such a perfect man was actually seduced by Qiao Mianmian.

But this didn’t mean anything.

She could even snatch the position of the daughter of the Bai family, let alone a man.

Now that she was the daughter of the Bai family, she was worthy of the Mo family’s man.

With Qiao Mianmian’s current status, she definitely couldn’t enter the Mo family.

But she could!

She was just waiting for the little b*tch to be kicked. Why would she worry about not having a chance in the future?

...

Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi saw Madam Bai walking out of the kitchen in an apron.

“Mianmian, Yesi, you’re here.”

Madam Bai saw Qiao Mianmian and couldn’t help but hold her hand. “Mianmian, are you hungry? Wait a while more, Aunt Bai will be done soon.”

Qiao Anxin’s expression darkened when she saw that Madam Bai was still so affectionate towards Qiao Mianmian. She scolded the little slut in her heart and pretended to be jealous. “Mom, Sister just arrived and you only have her in your eyes.

“I’m getting jealous.”

Madam Bai’s expression stiffened when she heard that. A few seconds later, she smiled and said, “You’re family, Mianmian and Yesi are guests. Moreover, Mianmian is your sister. Don’t you want me to treat her better?”

“...Of course not.” Qiao Anxin’s expression stiffened. She bit her lip and forced a smile. “Of course I hope you can treat Sister better, Mom. I’m just... joking.”

Even if Qiao Anxin didn’t care about how the Bai family treated her.

But when she saw how Madam Bai treated Qiao Mianmian so affectionately and treated her “biological daughter” so indifferently, she felt indignant.

She was Madam Bai’s “daughter.”

Qiao Mianmian was just an outsider.

But Madam Bai treated an outsider better than her.

“Mom.” Qiao Anxin refused to lose to Qiao Mianmian now. She walked over and held Madam Bai’s arm affectionately. “Don’t go to the kitchen, leave the rest to the servants. I know you want to cook for me personally, but I can’t bear to see you so tired.”
