Chapter 16: Let’s Go, I’ll Meet Your Brother

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Master, madam. Is it time to return to the company?”

The driver no longer called her Ms. Qiao.

“Do you want to go to the hospital to see your brother?” Mo Yesi’s cold eyes fell on her face.

“Yes.” Qiao Mianmian nodded.

Mo Yesi said, “Go to the hospital first.”

Qiao Mianmian hesitated and said hurriedly, “I’ll take a taxi by myself.”

She knew he was busy.

When he had left Mo Firm just now, there had been a pile of papers on his desk.

Although the two were already married, it wasn’t because they loved each other.

Qiao Mianmian didn’t really treat him as a husband, so she didn’t want to bother him too much.

Mo Yesi ignored her and said directly to the driver, “Go to the hospital.”

His insistence caused Qiao Mianmian to be unable to refuse.

She was silent for a few seconds, then pursed her lips and whispered softly, “Thank you.”

As soon as she said this, Mo Yesi’s dark and deep eyes swept over her and he frowned, looking unhappy. “Do you need to be so polite to your husband? Qiao Mianmian, I don’t care how you’re going to adapt to our relationship, but next time, I don’t want to hear those two words from you again.”

When he said this, his voice was low and suppressive.

The atmosphere inside the car turned cramped.

Qiao Mianmian was a little breathless with this powerful aura.

She swallowed, unconsciously shrank back, and whispered, “I know.”

It seemed that she suddenly realized that the husband she had married was rich and handsome, but his temper didn’t seem to be very good.

Sure enough, no one was perfect.

They arrived at the hospital.

The driver got out of the car, walked to the back of the car, pulled the door, and retreated respectfully.

Qiao Mianmian thought Mo Yesi would only bring her.

She picked up her bag, got out of the car, and waved at the people inside the car. “Then I’ll go first. You, you be careful on the road.”

She was really not used to her relationship with Mo Yesi yet.

They had just been strangers who didn’t know each other awhile ago.

Now this man had become her husband.

Then, she turned to leave.

But she heard a cold magnetic voice behind her. “What’s the matter, who told you I was going back to the company?”

“Eh?”

Qiao Mianmian turned around.

Mo Yesi got out of the car, buttoned his cufflinks and walked slowly towards her.

“You...” She froze.

Mo Yesi came to her.

He stretched out his arms and pulled her into his embrace.

Surrounded by his warm and seductive breath, with his hot hands clasped around her waist, Qiao Mianmian’s face turned red.

As soon as she pushed him away, she heard him say coldly, “Qiao Mianmian, I wanted you to marry me not to be a fake couple with you. Now that we are married, I should also see your family.”

Qiao Mianmian stiffened.

She knew it.

Before they had gone to get the marriage certificate, he had said that he wanted to be a real couple with her.

So any physical contact was normal.

She... should not push him away.

She froze in his arms for a few seconds, no longer struggling.

Mo Yesi smirked in satisfaction, holding her thin waist and tightening his hand around it slightly. “Let’s go, I want to see my wife’s brother.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

When he used the name “wife’s brother”, Qiao Mianmian stiffened again.

He led her into the hospital.

But Qiao Mianmian tugged at his sleeve and stopped.

“Wait a minute, I have something to say.”
