I only love Anxin: [That’s right, sister. If you see our comments, come forward and clarify everything. The entire situation is making me so anxious.] Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

After some of the netizens saw the fans’ comments, they also commented to attack them: [Sis Anxin must have seen your comments and is purposely ignoring them. I didn’t really believe in the entire matter. However, judging by the situation now, I think it might be true, after all.]

The fans immediately attacked back: [How dare you frame our Anxin without any evidence!]

The netizen scoffed: [Are you guys blind? Can’t you see the photo that was posted?]

The fans replied: [How can the photo be considered as evidence. It can be photoshopped.]

The netizen scoffed again: [Experts have determined that the photo isn’t photoshopped. I can’t believe you guys can be so delusional. Remember to control your tears when the truth is confirmed.]

Things were heating up on Weibo.

The tag for #QiaoAnxinisasidechick# was on the popular list, and there were hundreds of millions commenting on it.

Normally, the agency would immediately spend money to remove the tag from the popular list.

But Star Splendor continued to remain silent.

...

After finishing a class, some girls went up to Qiao Mianmian and asked, “Qiao Mianmian, is Qiao Anxin your sister?”

Qiao Anxin was also from Yuncheng City Film Academy.

She signed a contract with an agency in her freshman year and became popular after a web series. As she became one of the top-rated female actresses, her popularity in school grew as well.

Every student knew her.

But few knew that Qiao Mianmian was her sister.

Qiao Mianmian also didn’t mention it to anyone, except Jiang Luoli.

Qiao Anxin didn’t mention Qiao Mianmian to anyone as well.

When Qiao Anxin was still in school, they wouldn’t even greet each other when they met.

Who would’ve thought that the two of them would be sisters sharing the same father?

Qiao Mianmian glanced at the unfamiliar faces in front of her and frowned.

She didn’t like it when people gossiped in front of her, especially when she was a part of the gossip.

But she couldn’t have an outburst as well.

She kept quiet for a moment before replying nonchalantly, “Yes.”

The girls yelled in excitement and continued, “Are the rumors real? Did she... steal your boyfriend from you?”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Couldn’t they tell from her expression?

Did she look happy to answer all of their questions?

Did they think she was happy to answer all of their questions because she didn’t reject them directly?

She rubbed her head and said, “I’m sorry, but excuse me. I need to go to the bathroom.”

But the girls were dense.

They stood in front of her and continued asking, “Come on, we’re all classmates. Just tell us. Is that the reason why Qiao Anxin hasn’t replied? Is it because it’s true?”

“Yeah, if it’s true, you’re a victim. Tell us and we will scold her for you.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“Hey, what’s up with you guys.”

Just as Qiao Mianmian was at a loss on how to deal with the situation, Jiang Luoli approached them and stood in front of her protectively. “Can’t you tell that Mianmian doesn’t want to answer the questions? You guys have no situational awareness.”
