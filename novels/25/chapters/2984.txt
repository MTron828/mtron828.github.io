Chapter 2985: Celebration Party

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The next day, the crew held a celebration party.

Besides Qiao Mianmian, who was holding a wedding overseas, the other main actors attended the celebration party.

At the celebration party, after they praised the movie’s results and the actors’ acting skills, then it was finally the reporters’ Q&A session.

The reporters were prepared.

The first reporter raised a sensitive topic. The actor she asked was Shen Fei. “Sister Fei, we now know that ‘Phoenix in Flight’ has achieved very good results. Sister Fei’s performance in this movie is also rather outstanding. It left a deep impression on us.

“The audience has a lot of discussions about Sister Fei’s character. However, the current trending topic is that Qiao Mianmian, the second female lead, is more popular than you. The audience seems to have a deeper impression of her as the second female lead. I wonder what Sister Fei thinks about this?”

This question was a little unfriendly.

If Shen Fei didn’t answer well, it would be her being jealous of the second female lead.

If she acted too casually, others would say that she was pretending not to care. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Hence, after the reporter asked this question, the director on stage frowned as if he was dissatisfied with the reporter’s question.

Shen Fei smiled and thought for a while before replying, “If I say that I’m glad, I wonder if people will think I’m hypocritical. Whether you think so or not, I feel hypocritical myself.”

She paused for a few seconds, and the reporters laughed.

“Alright, I admit that I’ma little envious, but I’m not jealous.

“could already foresee Mianmian’s excellence. I saw her potential and capability on the day of the audition. I knew that her excellence would be discovered sooner or later and admired. She’s young, beautiful, smart, and humble. I really like her.

“Tdon’t think it’s a big deal to be outdone by a junior I like and admire. On the contrary, | feel that this is another form of motivation for me. Many of us old foxes don’t have the drive to work hard anymore. But if a junior who’s more outstanding than me appears and is always driven by others to compete

with me, my drive will be triggered immediately.

“You all know that women love to compare, no matter what.”

The crowd burst into laughter again.

But it was all friendly laughter.

Shen Fei winked at the reporters and said cheekily, “So, feel free to compare us. I don’t mind.

“Maybe then, I can get an international Best Actress next year or the year after.”

The reporters were amused again.

Shen Fei was indeed Shen Fei.

She teased them like this.

It was so easy.

“Then, Sister Fei, do you know that Qiao Mianmian is holding a wedding overseas today?” another reporter asked.

Shen Fei nodded. “Of course.”

“We all know that Sister Fei seems to have a good relationship with Qiao Mianmian in private. Didn’t she invite you to her wedding?”

“No, we’ve discussed this before. In the end, she decided to come back and invite me for a meal.” Shen Fei smiled and said, “Her wedding is set to be on the day the movie is released. I’m the female lead, and she’s the second female lead.. If I attend her wedding, won’t the two main actresses be missing

from the celebration party?”
