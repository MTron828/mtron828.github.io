“My friend is Qiao Mianmian’s makeup artiste. She told me that Qiao Mianmian is the best without makeup.”

“She’s just a passerby. She doesn’t care about her looks. Qiao Mianmian is indeed very beautiful. This commercial is very fairy-like. In comparison, Sister Qiao Anxin’s commercial is very average. The official Weibo account signed the two sisters at the same time, and the products endorsed by the two sisters were released on the same day. Are they trying to compare whose product is better?”

After a while, the director reposted it.

Zhao Bo V: “This is the first time a female artiste is willing to appear on screen with her bare face, just to show her true self to everyone. Does everyone feel this sincerity? That’s right, Qiao Mianmian appeared on screen without makeup. She’s really bare-faced.”

Zhao Bo scrolled through Weibo and found out that Qiao Mianmian was bare-faced. Many people were in awe.

“Really? Damn, these looks are too good.”

“My Mianmian used to send nude photos. Her looks and skin have always been good. You just didn’t notice it.”

“Not to mention anything else, Qiao Mianmian is indeed very exquisite and beautiful. She’s also very good-looking among the celebrities. I like her looks.”

“A passerby, not a fan of anyone. Just looking at these two advertisements, Qiao Mianmian makes people want to buy more. Qiao Anxin isn’t bad, it’s just that she’s losing out by being compared to Qiao Mianmian. The difference in their looks is too huge.”

After the advertisement was released, Qiao Mianmian’s advertisement received unanimous praise.

Qiao Anxin’s reaction was average.

Qiao Anxin’s face turned green when she saw the netizens praising Qiao Mianmian.

She thought that with her reputation, Qiao Mianmian would definitely be the one to be crushed by her.

In the end, Qiao Mianmian was trending again because of an advertisement.

But she wasn’t even in the last place.

She was worse than a newbie!

Qiao Anxin slammed her cell phone on the table.

“Did Qiao Mianmian that slut buy the Internet Water Army? Why are they all praising her now? And that Zhao Bo isn’t bewitched by her too, right? He’s praising her so much, he can’t wait to make her popular.

“That bitch is so shameless. She’s seducing men everywhere. She doesn’t know how to behave.

“Why are these men so superficial? What do they like about her? Just because of her vixen-like face?”

“That goes without saying. It’s obvious that she hired the Internet Water Army. She’s just a newbie, why should she be on the hot searches for no reason? It seems like Huan Yu is prepared to groom her. I guess it’s because of her boyfriend. I wonder who that man is.”

Qiao Anxin kept quiet.

She knew Mo Yesi’s identity.

Although the Mo Corporation didn’t have an artiste management company, it was easy for Chairman Mo to groom a female artiste.

Moreover, Bai Yusheng was now Qiao Mianmian’s biological brother.

With Bai Yusheng’s status in the entertainment industry, it was very easy for him to make anyone popular.

Qiao Mianmian had several big trees backing her now. She could get whatever resources she wanted easily.

As for her.

She had to accompany a disgusting old man in exchange for some resources to have her current exposure.
