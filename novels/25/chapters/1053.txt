Chapter 1054: Very Tempting

Mo Shixiu nodded. “Alright, we won’t remove the band for now.”

The waiter quickly removed all the candles and roses as per his instructions.

Ten minutes later, the restaurant was back to normal. The lights weren’t as dim as before, and the eerie feeling of a haunted house was gone.

Jiang Luoli finally stopped feeling cold.

Mo Shixiu was always watching her. “Miss Jiang, are you feeling better now?”

“Mm, much better.” Jiang Luoli looked into his eyes and felt her heart race.

The man looked at her intently.

He seemed to only have eyes for her.

It tempted her.

Her heart raced wildly.

She really had no immunity towards men like Mo Shixiu.

Even though her mind told her to stay away from him, she lost all rationality when facing him.

“That’s good.” Mo Shixiu picked up his fork and knife and gently cut the steak in front of him. He said gently, “Miss Jiang, you can try the steak. It tastes pretty good. Miss Jiang, you must be hungry. Eat something first, we’ll talk later, alright?”

“... Alright.” The man’s voice was low, gentle, and magnetic. It was Jiang Luoli’s favorite kind of low voice.

She couldn’t resist it when he spoke to her in such a gentle voice.

Jiang Luoli was hungry too.

She felt that she should fill her stomach first and talk about other things later.

There was no rush.

Jiang Luoli didn’t want this date to end too soon.

Since this was their last meeting.

She hoped to spend more time with this man tonight.

After all, if she wanted to see him again, she could only do it by watching the news.

Jiang Luoli picked up her fork and knife, only to see Mo Shixiu pick up his steak and place it on her plate.

He took her steak that hadn’t been cut.

Jiang Luoli looked at him in shock. “Mr. Mo, you’re...”

“Miss Jiang, this is the first time I’m doing this for a lady. Assistant Xu said that girls would think that men are thoughtful by doing this. Do you dislike it?” Mo Shixiu was probably doubting Assistant Xu’s suggestion because of what happened previously. Seeing that Jiang Luoli didn’t seem to like it, he wondered if she disliked it.

“No.” Jiang Luoli immediately shook her head. “That’s really sweet. Did Assistant Xu teach you to do that too?”

“Yes.” Mo Shixiu finally got her approval for something. He smiled and seemed more relaxed. “I’m sorry, but I still have to ask others about our first date.

“I’ve never dated a girl before, so I’m not very good at this. This is my first date with Miss Jiang, and the meaning is very different, so I hope to give you a good experience. But I seem to have failed.”

With that, Mo Shixiu sighed. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Jiang Luoli’s heart thumped wildly.

It was because of Mo Shixiu’s “very different meaning”.
