Chapter 2202: Not Many People Pays Attention to Her Anymore

“This is a gentleness that Miss Shen will never get. Us irrelevant people are so envious of her. I wonder how she feels when she sees it. She probably won’t be able to sleep tonight.”

“Don’t say anymore. Can’t you see that Shen Rou’s expression is already terrible?”

“Sigh. In my opinion, she shouldn’t have come tonight. Isn’t she only being bullied? She used to be in the limelight everywhere, but now that she’s been bullied, I actually feel a little appeased.”

“Let’s not talk about her. There’s nothing much to say. I heard that there are many good things in the upcoming auction. The auction is about to begin, let’s go and take a look.”

“I heard that there’s even a set of jewelry worn by a medieval princess. I wonder if it’s true.”

The few women were instantly interested when they talked about jewelry. As they spoke, they walked towards the auction venue.

On the other side.

Shen Rou was surrounded by a few men who had feelings for her. They were all flattering her, but Shen Rou didn’t have the pride and joy from before.

Because the satisfaction these things gave her was far less than the blow she received from Qiao Mianmian.

Qiao Mianmian became the center of attention tonight.

Qiao Mianmian was in the limelight tonight.

Everyone was focused on her.

And Shen Rou was like an outdated celebrity. Not many people paid attention to her anymore.

She no longer had the glory of the past.

Everything that originally belonged to her was taken away by Qiao Mianmian.

Shen Rou didn’t hear what the men around her were saying. She watched as Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi were led out of the hall, thinking about how to take revenge on Qiao Mianmian.

“Miss Shen, Miss Shen—”

The men around her talked for a while, but Shen Rou didn’t respond. Then, they saw her looking in a certain direction.

The direction of the auction venue.

Shen Rou only snapped back to her senses after being called a few times.

“What’s Miss Shen looking at? Is Miss Shen interested in tonight’s auction?”

Shen Rou was stunned. “Auction?”

“That’s right. Old Guo even prepared an auction. The auction is going to start soon. Miss Shen, do you want to take a look?”

…

The auction was held elsewhere in the manor.

Mo Yesi, Gong Zeli, Bai Yusheng, and Yan Shaoqing had already arranged the best seats for themselves. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

When Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi arrived at the auction hall, some people were already there.

Yan Shaoqing was there, too.

His seat was in the same row as theirs.

Seeing them approach, Yan Shaoqing waved at them. When Qiao Mianmian and Mo Yesi were seated, Yan Shaoqing asked with interest, “Second Bro, Sis-in-law, do you have anything you’re interested in tonight?”

Qiao Mianmian was confused.

She had no idea what was being auctioned tonight.

Mo Yesi said calmly, “I’m just looking around. If you’re interested in anything, just go for it.”

“I heard there’s a set of jewelry tonight. It’s a beloved item of a former princess consort. That set of jewelry was a love token given to her by the King at first sight!”
