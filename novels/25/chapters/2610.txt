Chapter 2612: Beat Song Fei

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Song Fei was used to being flattered and feeling invincible.

She felt that she could do whatever she wanted.

She knew Qiao Mianmian.

She also knew Qiao Mianmian’s background.

But she wasn’t afraid.

In Song Fei’s opinion, her fans were omnipotent. There was nothing her fans couldn’t do.

So what if it was Qiao Mianmian?

She had to provoke someone that no one else dared to provoke.

She didn’t believe that offending Qiao Mianmian was bad.

Qiao Mianmian wasn’t in charge of the entertainment industry.

Moreover, although Song Fei had undergone plastic surgery, she seemed to have forgotten what she used to look like. She only thought that her appearance after plastic surgery was her true appearance.

Her fans always praised her in the group chat, saying that she was the most beautiful woman in the entertainment industry.

Song Fei heard this too many times and felt that she was really the most beautiful.

She naturally couldn’t accept people saying that Qiao Mianmian was prettier than her.

Hence, when she found out that her fans had torn Qiao Mianmian apart, she wasn’t worried about the consequences at all. Instead, she felt very happy.

She touched her face and snorted. “Hmph, you don’t deserve to be compared to me. You deserve to be scolded.”

…

On the other side.

Qiao Mianmian also found out from Linda that her fans were fighting with Song Fei’s fans.

“Song Fei? Why are my fans fighting with her fans? I’ve never interacted with her before, right?”

“Because someone said something that made her fans unhappy.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“What?”

“He said you’re prettier than Song Fei.”

“…”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t expect it to be so ridiculous. “Just because of this?”

She didn’t believe it.

“Just because of this, her fans attacked you like crazy. Your fans naturally had to defend you. Then, someone dug up Song Fei’s plastic surgery history. As time went by, the conflict between the two sides got worse.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

“Song Fei’s fans are notoriously difficult to deal with. The female artistes they tore apart can form a football team. You’re unlucky to have offended her fans. This is an undeserved calamity.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Wasn’t it an undeserved calamity?

She hadn’t done anything.

“But her fans are too much. Moreover, we already know about this. Song Fei must know too, but she and her agency didn’t respond. Now, her fans are crazily spreading rumors about you on Weibo.”

Qiao Mianmian was silent for a while. “Sister Xie, do you think I should respond to this?”

“There’s no need to respond, but it’s fine to teach her a lesson. It’s fine if it’s just the behavior of a fan, but if Song Fei doesn’t stop them despite knowing what her fans have done, then teach her a lesson.”

“How should I teach her a lesson?”

“I know about your scandals. They don’t have any concrete evidence. As for her scandals, I have a lot of evidence here. So, leave this to me. On the other hand…

“Didn’t her fans tear you apart because they couldn’t bear to hear anyone say that you’re more beautiful than Song Fei? Then, you’d better blind her fans tonight.

“Baby, what you have to do is to be high-profile tonight! We’ll use our abilities to beat Song Fei!”
