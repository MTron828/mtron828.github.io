Chapter 2651: You’ll Know Once You See It

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

She really couldn’t understand why a married woman could be surrounded by so many outstanding men.

Song Fei was stunned for a moment. She looked up, the jealousy in her eyes still lingering.

Her manager, Chen Li, stood in front of her. She frowned and said, “Song Fei, I told you long ago that Qiao Mianmian isn’t someone you can offend. Why won’t you listen to me?

“This is great. You’ve offended her badly. No one can help you this time. Song Fei, let me tell you, you’re finished.”

Song Fei’s sugar daddy was the boss of the company.

Hence, although Chen Li was her manager, she couldn’t control her. She was usually very polite to her. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

But Chen Li wasn’t being polite now.

It was the first time she was cold to Song Fei.

Song Fei was used to being a “queen” in the company, and Chen Li had always been polite to her. She couldn’t stand it when Chen Li said such cold words.

She immediately said rudely, “Sister Li, what do you mean? Are you blaming me? Do you think I offended Qiao Mianmian on purpose? I was just fighting for my own interests. I don’t think I did anything wrong. How did I offend her?”

Song Fei didn’t like it when her manager mentioned Qiao Mianmian.

It made her angry.

What was so great about Qiao Mianmian?

What else could she do to her?

Hadn’t Qiao Mianmian’s fans been pinned to the ground by her fans?

She hadn’t seen Qiao Mianmian do anything to stand up for her fans.

Chen Li saw that she was still being stubborn and couldn’t help but sneer. “You know very well if you did it on purpose. Whether you did it on purpose or not, it’s meaningless to say anything now.”

It was obvious that Song Fei didn’t know what was going on.

Chen Li thought about how angry she was usually and how arrogant Song Fei usually was. She couldn’t help but feel a little malicious.

She smiled and said softly, “Song Fei, you still don’t know what’s happening right now, do you? Instead of arguing with me, why don’t you take out your cell phone and check Weibo to see what you’ve caused?

“When you’re done, if you can still be stubborn, I’ll really admire you.”

Song Fei frowned. She had a bad feeling. “What do you mean?”

Chen Li: “You’ll know when you see it.”

Song Fei frowned even harder. She immediately took out her cell phone and opened Weibo.

The moment she did, she saw that her name was all over the hot searches list.

# Song Fei’s dirt secret is out. She’s sleeping with many married men #

# Song Fei and Ji Jun’s rankings are exposed #

# Song Fei has participated in many campus violence incidents #

# Shocking! The Devil Girl in the Baby Fall Is Song Fei #

Song Fei almost fainted when she saw the last post.

Her hand trembled.

When she was 10, she did something very evil.

Because her parents weren’t on good terms, she lived in negative emotions for a long time. That day, her parents had another argument, and she ran out of the house in despair..
