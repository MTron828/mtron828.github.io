Chapter 1435: He Won’t Let You Off

“If Second Bro sees you staring at his wife like that, he won’t let you off.”

“So what?” Perhaps angered by his words, Gong Zeli said coldly, “I know that a friend’s wife cannot be bullied. I’ve never thought of doing anything, but can’t I think about it?”

Yan Shaoqing was stunned and his expression changed. “Fourth Bro, you really... I suggest you keep your feelings for Sis-in-law if you don’t want to lose Second Bro. Even if you can’t do it now, don’t make it so obvious.

“We’ve been brothers for so many years. Do you think it’s worth it if this makes us look bad?

“There are so many women in the world, why would you... Fourth Bro, what are you thinking?”

Gong Zeli didn’t want to hide it from Yan Shaoqing.

Hence, he admitted it.

He knew how wrong this was in the eyes of others.

He felt like a jerk too.

But he couldn’t control himself.

“There are some things you don’t understand.” Gong Zeli didn’t intend to explain further. “If you’re worried that I won’t get along with Ah Si because of this, you can rest assured. I know what can and cannot be done.

“I don’t intend to do anything, much less affect Ah Si’s marriage.”

“But Fourth Bro, didn’t you dislike Sis-in-law a lot previously? Also, what’s going on between you and Shen Rou? Isn’t the person you like Shen Rou? I really don’t believe that you’ve changed your mind so quickly.

“Did something happen...” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Don’t ask anymore.” Gong Zeli’s voice became even fainter. “You don’t have to know what happened. If you want to continue being friends with Shen Rou, that’s your freedom. But we can’t be friends anymore.

“You don’t have to persuade me. We can’t go back to the past.”

Yan Shaoqing opened his mouth and swallowed his words.

He wanted to persuade him about Shen Rou.

But Gong Zeli was so determined now, it wasn’t something he could persuade with just a few words.

Something serious must have happened between him and Shen Rou.

Although Gong Zeli refused to say it, Yan Shaoqing had a feeling that this had something to do with Qiao Mianmian.

“Alright, as long as you know what you’re doing. In any case, don’t do anything foolish.” Yan Shaoqing knew that as a brother, he would at most remind and persuade him. As for what Gong Zeli thought, he couldn’t control it.

He had already reminded and persuaded him.

He didn’t care if Gong Zeli listened to him.

A while later, Gong Zeli and Yan Shaoqing left.

Shen Rou walked out from under a tree.

Her eyes were filled with hatred.

“Qiao Mianmian.” She gritted her teeth and spat out the name with hatred.

She really hated it.

Gong Zeli really liked that slut.

She had nothing now.

If it wasn’t for Qiao Mianmian, she would at least have Gong Zeli.

But now, she had nothing.

Everything was thanks to Qiao Mianmian.
