Chapter 1112: Must You Be So Ruthless?

However, even though she kept telling herself that it was impossible, she couldn’t help but feel afraid deep down.

She was afraid that what she was worried about would become reality.

She was afraid that the lowly and poor woman would become a rich young lady like her.

The main reason why Madam Mo was on her side and wanted to matchmake Mo Yesi and her was because she felt that the Shen and Mo families were compatible.

If she knew about the Shen family’s current situation, no matter how much Madam Mo liked her, she would probably hesitate.

If Qiao Mianmian became the daughter of the Bai family, with the Bai family’s current status, what reason would Madam Mo have to object to her being with Mo Yesi?

Even the Shen family wanted to rely on the power of the Bai family.

If Qiao Mianmian became the daughter of the Bai family, she would have no advantage over her.

Shen Rou would never allow such a thing to happen.

Regardless of whether she was overthinking or if there was really such a possibility, she had to investigate this matter thoroughly.

It would be best if things were not as she had guessed. It would be best if she was overthinking.

However, if her guess was true, she wouldn’t allow it to become reality.

She wouldn’t tolerate a person who was once far inferior to her rise above her in the future.

She would never let that happen!

...

The next day.

Qiao Mianmian, who was still on vacation, was woken up by an unfamiliar call early in the morning.

When she saw that it was an unknown number, she hung up immediately. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

She thought it was a harassment call.

But that number quickly called her again.

Qiao Mianmian was already angry about being woken up, so she picked up the call angrily. “Hello, this is Qiao Mianmian. May I know who this is?”

Although she was full of anger, she thought it might be work-related and spoke nicely.

“Qiao Mianmian, do you have to be so ruthless?” An angry voice was heard. The man seemed to be very angry as he questioned her.

Qiao Mianmian frowned and said coldly, “I was wondering who was disturbing my sleep so early in the morning. So, it’s you. Su Ze, did you call the wrong number? I don’t understand what you’re saying.”

Qiao Mianmian had long blocked Su Ze’s number.

Suze probably realized that he had been blacklisted and changed his number to call her.

“You don’t understand?” Su Ze had already fallen out with her that night, so he no longer pretended to be a gentleman. He said coldly in a low voice, “Don’t tell me you didn’t want to take revenge on me, that’s why Gong Zeli attacked Starlight.

“Qiao Mianmian, I didn’t expect you to be so indecent, such a casual woman. One moment you’re with the man surnamed Mo, the next you’re with the man surnamed Gong. How many sugar daddies do you have?

“To think that I used to think that you were pure and innocent. I even thought that you were a pure and kind woman. I was actually afraid that I would scare you, so I didn’t dare to get too close to you. But in the end, you’re just a b*tch that can be easily slept with just because you’re rich.”

Ever since Su Ze found out that Qiao Mianmian wasn’t a virgin, she was no longer pure in his heart.

She was no longer a woman worth him taking seriously and giving his heart to.

He already felt that Qiao Mianmian was a casual woman, so he naturally didn’t respect her as much as before.
