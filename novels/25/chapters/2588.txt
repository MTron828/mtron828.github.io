Chapter 2590: It’s Better to Be Happy

“Little Xiao, don’t cry. No matter what, I’ll only be your fan in this life.”

“Boohoo, Sister Little Xiao, don’t leave the entertainment industry. I hate that bad woman Qiao Mianmian. How can she be so bad?”

Fans had their own filter and double standards for their idols.

If this happened to other artistes, they would definitely feel that it was too much. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

But when it came to their idol, even if they knew that their idol had done something wrong, they would find thousands of excuses to prove that their idol hadn’t done anything wrong. They would even feel that their idol had been wronged and that everyone was a bad person who bullied their idol.

Little Xiao’s fans were very good at double standards.

In their eyes, Qiao Mianmian was a bully.

Qiao Mianmian left the comment section with a sneer.

She thought for a while and reposted Little Xiao’s apology post.

There was a caption.

Qiao Mianmian V: [If an apology is useful, why do you need the police? I’m sorry, you really shouldn’t expect my forgiveness. I’m just petty and narrow-minded, so I won’t accept an apology. Also, the weather has been dry these few days, I’ll treat everyone to a cup of green tea.]

In the end, she even attached an emoji with a few teacups filled with green tea.

Qiao Mianmian knew that this repost might attract another wave of negative news, but she didn’t care anymore.

Even if she didn’t do anything, there was no lack of negative news.

If someone wanted to defame her, it wouldn’t change anything.

She might as well be happy.

She was tired of being careful when posting on Weibo. She had to think about every word and about the consequences.

If posting on Weibo was so tiring, she felt that she probably didn’t want to go on Weibo anymore.

A few minutes later.

What Qiao Mianmian didn’t expect was that not only did her honest words not cause any negative effects, but they also added a lot of random fans to her.

“Hahaha, Qiao Mianmian is actually so fun. As a passerby, I express my love.”

“I didn’t expect that one day I’d be a fan of an artiste, not because of her work, but because of her personality? Damn, I like Qiao Mianmian’s temper. She says whatever she wants. There are too few artistes like her in the entertainment industry these days.”

“I didn’t understand it wrongly, right? Was that green tea hinting at a female artiste with the surname X? I think that female artiste with the surname X is pretty green tea too. The entire apology statement feels like a b*tch. Just apologize properly, as if she’s the victim.”

“The female celebrity’s apology is indeed a little slutty. I think all girls can tell. Hahaha, Qiao Mianmian’s green tea emoji really makes me laugh. She’s too daring. Qiao Mianmian’s a genius.”

Qiao Mianmian was a little stunned when she saw that the number of her fans increased instead of decreasing.

Why didn’t things go as she expected?

She thought that someone was going to accuse her again.

This wasn’t unprecedented.

But there seemed to be a change this time?
