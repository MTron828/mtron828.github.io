Chapter 2523: Trembling and Difficult to Breathe

“Mianmian, you’ve succeeded. Shen Rou has really been beaten up by you this time. And Gong Zeli’s recording has also helped it. Her image is completely ruined now, and everyone is scolding her online. I think she won’t be able to make a comeback this time.

“Hahaha, seeing her being scolded like a dog by the netizens really makes me happy. I should let her have a good taste of being abused by the netizens. But I really didn’t expect your social relations in the industry to be so good. This time, many artistes expressed their support for you.”

“It can’t be called a good relationship, it’s just that everyone is following the trend.” Qiao Mianmian analyzed calmly. “Shen Fei and Qin Han are the top artistes in the industry. They expressed their stance first, while the others expressed their stance later. Moreover, the artistes who expressed their stance are mostly under Huan Yu. Chairman Zhao should have told them to do it.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Huan Yu was the largest entertainment company in Yuncheng City.

It could be said that 60% of the artistes in the city were under Huan Yu.

Since they were artistes from the same company, they had to express their stand.

“If they really support me, they should have expressed their support when I was criticized by the entire internet.”

“That’s right, but it’s not bad even if others are expressing their opinions now. Chairman Zhao has already informed them, but whether they do it or not is up to them. Anyway, it’s not a bad thing to have more people help you.”

“Mm, I know.” Qiao Mianmian smiled. “Sister Xie, you can rest assured now.”

“Don’t worry.” Linda was also smiling. “You handled this matter very well. If it was handed to the company, it definitely wouldn’t have such an effect. I really want to know how Shen Rou is feeling now.”

“Her?” Qiao Mianmian smiled. “Who knows. She must be very angry.”

…

At this moment.

In the Chairman’s office of the Shen Corporation.

Shen Rou saw the entire post.

She also saw the evidence posted on Huan Yu’s official account.

After reading the post, Shen Rou’s face went pale.

She never expected such a reversal.

She never expected Qiao Mianmian to get so much evidence.

Her alternate Weibo account was discovered.

The company she hired was also found out.

The clear evidence was like a long nail pinning her to the chopping board.

She saw how the netizens scolded her.

If she was happy to see the netizens scold Qiao Mianmian previously, now that she was facing the same thing, she was dealt a huge blow.

Those malicious comments.

Those filthy insults.

She was angered within 10 minutes.

“No wonder Mo Yesi didn’t fall for Shen Rou even after she clung onto him for over 20 years. Such a scheming bitch is so disgusting. Whoever likes her must be blind.”

“It has been proven that both Mo Yesi and Gong Zeli are wise. Shen Rou deserved everything that happened to her today. I think a bad woman like her should be left alone for the rest of her life.”
