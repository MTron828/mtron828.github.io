She left the hotel.

Qiao Mianmian stood on the side of the road, looking at the busy streets absentmindedly.

Just a week ago, Su Ze had taken her to the Su family’s house. Father Su and Mother Su had even asked them when they were getting married and wanted to discuss the specific date with them.

At that time, who would have expected that she and Su Ze would break up so soon?

Betrayed by her childhood sweetheart, and he had actually cheated on her with her stepsister of a different mother. Qiao Mianmian felt like her life was really ridiculous, it was so melodramatic!

She had thought that all men might be taken by Qiao Anxin, but not Su Ze.

However...

Only now did she know how naive and laughable her thoughts had been.

Reality slapped her in the face and woke her up completely.

Suddenly, her cell phone rang. Qiao Mianmian picked it up when she saw it was from the hospital.

“Hello.”

After listening, her face turned pale.

After getting out of the taxi, Qiao Mianmian rushed into the hospital.

Running too fast and too anxiously, she almost fell when she ran up the hospital stairs.

On a black Rolls-Royce parked not far away, the driver saw her hurriedly rushing into the hospital, thought for a while, then picked up the phone and dialed a phone number.

After the call went through, the driver said respectfully, “Chairman Mo.”

“What’s the matter?” At the other end of the phone, the man’s voice was low, cold, and full-textured, like a low, addictive sound of the cello.

“I have been following the lady as per your request, Chairman Mo. It appears something has happened to her family member and she just got a taxi to the hospital. She doesn’t look good and is very anxious. There are acquaintances in the hospital, would you like to talk to them?”

The driver would not dare to gossip usually.

This was the first time Chairman Mo had asked him to follow someone, and it was a woman.

This woman had come out of Chairman Mo’s room this morning!

Based on this alone, she held an extraordinary significance to Chairman Mo.

Before her, not even the shadow of a woman was around Chairman Mo!

The man on the other end was silent for a few seconds. “Go over and take a look.”

“Yes, Chairman Mo.”

In the hospital emergency room.

When Qiao Mianmian arrived, Qiao Chen was still under rescue.

After waiting for more than an hour in despair, the closed door of the operating room finally opened.

The doctors came out one after another.

Qiao Mianmian hurriedly walked over, grabbed the first doctor to come out, and asked, “Doctor, how is my brother?”

The doctor took off his mask. “The patient’s vital signs have stabilized, and there is no life threat for the time being.”

Qiao Mianmian’s tears flowed out suddenly. “So, my brother is safe now, right?”

“Yes.”

“Thank you, doctor! Thank you, doctor!” She was ecstatic and tears fell from her pale cheeks.

When Qiao Chen awoke, Qiao Mianmian was holding his hand and looking at his pale, frail face. She said distressedly, “Chen Chen, how do you feel? Would you like the doctor to come over and check on you?”

“Sister, I’m fine.”

Qiao Chen’s voice was hoarse, and his speech was a bit laborious. “You don’t have to worry about me.”

Qiao Mianmian pursed her lips tightly.

How could she not be worried?

Qiao Chen was her only loved one left in this world.
