Chapter 1248: Still Suspecting Her!

“Madam Bai, I-I can...” Qiao Anxin looked nervous and nervous. She bit her lip and looked uneasy. “Can I call you Mom?”

“Of course. We’re mother and daughter.” Madam Bai saw that her eyes and nose were red from crying, and her face was covered in tears. She sighed softly and reached out to wipe the tears on her face. “Anxin, so you’re willing to acknowledge me as your mother?”

“Mm!”

Qiao Anxin nodded and looked at her with teary eyes. “Mom.”

Madam Bai’s eyes welled up.

She looked at Qiao Anxin and sighed.

She finally found her daughter.

The four of them would be reunited in the future.

...

Bai Yusheng rushed home and saw Madam Bai and Qiao Anxin talking on the sofa.

Madam Bai held her hand gently. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Hearing footsteps, Madam Bai looked up and smiled when she saw him. “Yusheng, you’re back. Come over and talk to your sister. We were just talking about you.”

Sister?

Bai Yusheng glanced at Qiao Anxin sitting with Madam Bai and slowly walked over.

“Mom, there’s nothing wrong with the results?” Bai Yusheng didn’t care about Qiao Anxin’s feelings and asked directly, “You only let the doctor do it once?”

Madam Bai was stunned, and her expression changed slightly. “Yusheng, what are you talking about? How can there be an error!”

Bai Yusheng smiled, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “It’s only one test. Who knows, it might be wrong. In my opinion, we have to do it a few more times to be safe. Our Bai family is also a prestigious family. Even if we acknowledge our relatives, we can’t just acknowledge them casually.

“Mom, our family has been looking for Little Seven for 18 years. If we find the wrong person and let someone with ill intentions take advantage of the situation and replace her, wouldn’t it be a joke?”

Bai Yusheng looked straight at Qiao Anxin.

Qiao Anxin looked up and met his sharp gaze. Her heart skipped a beat, and panic filled her eyes.

She thought that it was already a done deal and that nothing would happen.

After all, with the test results, even if Madam Bai and Bai Yusheng suspected her previously, they should have dispelled their doubts now.

Moreover, Madam Bai had accepted her.

Just now, Madam Bai was still telling her to pick a day to meet Father and Mother Qiao tomorrow to talk about bringing her back to the Bai family.

Madam Bai also said that because she’d suffered a lot over the years, she couldn’t casually take her back to the Bai family.

At that time, they would have to hold a banquet and invite some relatives and friends to formally introduce her to them.

No matter how she looked at it, Madam Bai believed her completely.

She didn’t expect Bai Yusheng to still suspect her after the results were out!

And he even doubted her!

Obviously, he didn’t acknowledge her as his sister.

The appraisal was fake.

Hence, Qiao Anxin still felt guilty under Bai Yusheng’s scrutiny. She quickly lowered her head and didn’t dare to look him in the eye.
