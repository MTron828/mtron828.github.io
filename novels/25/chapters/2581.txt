Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“So, the other party got someone to spread rumors about you being shortlisted because of your connections. It’s very simple to get to the bottom of this. Let me get someone to investigate it. Don’t be in a rush to respond, I’ll get Wei Zheng to investigate it immediately.”

With that, Mo Yesi picked up his cell phone and called him.

Wei Zheng picked it up immediately.

Mo Yesi didn’t waste any time. “Find out what happened to Young Madam on the hot searches today. Find out if someone planned it or did it on their own. I’ll give you 10 minutes.”

Mo Yesi ended the call.

He placed his cell phone on the table and turned to look at Qiao Mianmian. “Don’t worry, Wei Zheng is already checking. We’ll find out what happened soon. When he finds out, you can think of a response.”

“Mm, I’m not in a hurry.” Qiao Mianmian nodded calmly. “It’s fine even if some people think that I was shortlisted because of my connections.”

“You don’t mind?” Mo Yesi was a little surprised.

“It’s not that I don’t care, it’s just that I can’t control other people’s thoughts.” Qiao Mianmian blinked. “If people really think that I relied on connections, it’s useless no matter how I try to clarify it.

“I was also expecting this to happen.”

“Really?”

“Mm. I’m the only newbie among all the nominees, and I’m the only one who got shortlisted with a single work. It’s understandable that someone doubts that I got shortlisted because of the Mo and Bai families’ power. It’s not necessarily a bad thing to slander others. I’ll definitely prove my capability in the future, and there’ll be a day when they approve of me because of my abilities. I believe in myself!”

“I believe in you, too.” Mo Yesi saw that she really didn’t care and wasn’t affected much, and was instantly relieved. “But this matter has to be investigated clearly. If someone is deliberately spreading rumors about you, we have to find that person.”

“What are you thinking, offending her at a time like this? If she finds out that you’re behind this, do you think you will be able to continue in the entertainment industry? Aren’t you afraid of being blacklisted?

“Eldest Young Lady Shen provoked her. Look at the outcome now. Did you know that someone revealed that Eldest Young Lady Shen’s car accident wasn’t entirely an accident? Do you know what this means?

“Aren’t you afraid that you’ll become the next Young Lady Shen?”

“Sister Aisha, I wasn’t the only one who sent Qiao Mianmian onto the hot searches. People were already questioning this, I just added fuel to the fire. How could I offend her?”

In a high-end condominium, a woman in a red nightgown was lying lazily on the sofa, with a glass of red wine in her hand.

She obviously didn’t agree with what her manager said.

“Little Xiao!”

“Alright, alright, Sister Aisha.” Little Xiao dragged her voice and sat up a little. She swirled the red wine in her glass and took a sip. “Don’t worry, it’ll be fine.

“My company is owned by a friend. He’s very careful and won’t be found out. Moreover, this isn’t an important matter. How is it as serious as you say? I can’t take it lying down..”
