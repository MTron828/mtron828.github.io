Chapter 1420: He Missed It Himself

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“There are so many rich young ladies in Yuncheng City who can’t even get two golden bachelors. How did they end up being single together? Now that they’ve brought them back to meet their parents, it’s probably good news.”

“I didn’t expect them to be the first to start a family.”

Lu Rao smiled. “It’s not easy to be single when you meet the person you’re destined to be with. Young Master Yan might be like this one day, getting married without a word. We don’t know.”

“I wouldn’t do such a thing. Tsk, what destiny? You actually believe this?” Yan Shaoqing didn’t believe it. But just as he finished speaking, a figure that he’d deliberately forgotten for the past few days appeared in his mind.

His expression changed and he lost his good mood.

Gong Zeli pursed his lips and kept quiet. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The destined person?

He knew that the person he was destined to meet had appeared, but she had appeared too late.

So late that he lost the chance to have her.

No, she didn’t appear too late.

She appeared 10 years ago.

God had arranged for her to be by his side a long time ago, giving him ample opportunity.

But he missed it.

And some opportunities, once missed, would never happen again.

Yan Shaoqing turned around and was about to speak to Gong Zeli when he saw that Gong Zeli’s eyes were following Qiao Mianmian. Besides Qiao Mianmian, he didn’t look at anyone else.

And the way he looked at Qiao Mianmian...

Yan Shaoqing could tell that something was wrong with Gong Zeli.

That look was too abnormal.

He shouldn’t be looking at his brother’s wife like that.

Yan Shaoqing suddenly recalled Gong Zeli’s strange behavior and the rumors about him and Qiao Mianmian. As he thought about it, his expression changed.

If his speculation was true, things would be terrible.

They had played together since they were young, and their friendship was extraordinary.

Yan Shaoqing didn’t want the two of them to be at loggerheads.

In the end, they wouldn’t even be brothers.

He stared at Gong Zeli for a while and frowned. He nudged him with his elbow and said softly, “Fourth Bro, come with me. I have something to tell you.”

Yan Shaoqing then left.

Gong Zeli watched him leave and then followed after him.

Lu Rao watched them leave and thought for a while. He smiled meaningfully and turned to talk to Bai Yusheng.

Madam Shen and Shen Rou looked awful.

She asked Shen Rou with a dark expression, “Rourou, who are those two?”

Mo Yesi and Mo Shixiu were both future sons-in-law that Madam Shen liked first. She originally thought that with the Shen and Mo families’ relationship, her daughter would definitely marry into the Mo family in the future.

Be it marrying Mo Yesi or Mo Shixiu, she would be the Young Madam of the Mo family.

But she didn’t expect that the two future sons-in-law she liked weren’t interested in her daughter.

Madam Shen naturally felt that her daughter was outstanding and perfect. It was definitely not her daughter’s fault that her two sons didn’t like her.

Moreover, Mo Yesi and Mo Shixiu never had a woman by their side. Madam Shen felt that these two sons of the Mo family probably didn’t like women.
