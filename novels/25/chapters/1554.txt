Chapter 1555: Is She Here to Be Tortured?

“Ah Li, how can you say this? Our family can only count on you now. If you don’t do anything, what will happen to Xiao Hai?” Father Jiang’s expression darkened. “Xiao Hai is your brother, can you bear to see him suffer?”

Jiang Luoli clenched her fists and looked at the couple who were supposed to be her parents but were more like strangers.

These were her biological parents.

She pursed her lips and kept quiet for a while before saying mockingly, “Xiao Hai is my biological brother, so I have to help him. Even if he owes someone 10 million, I have to think of a way to help him pay it back.

“He’s your precious son, so you can’t bear to let him suffer. But what about me?”

Jiang Luoli was disappointed. “You don’t even know where I can find these 10 million yuan. You’re asking me what to do with Little Hai, but have you thought about what I should do? I don’t have this sum, and even if I did, I wouldn’t take it out to help him repay his debt.

“He can bear the consequences of his own actions.”

“Y-You...” Mother Jiang was so angry that her face turned green. She pointed at her nose and started scolding. “Jiang Luoli, are you still human? You’re so cruel to your own brother. Do you think you can really ignore it just because you say so? You’re my flesh and blood. You grew up eating the Jiang family’s food. Don’t even think of being a shopkeeper.

“If you don’t help me get your brother out, I’ll make a scene at your school.

“By then, everyone in school will know what kind of person you are.

Father Jiang saw Jiang Luoli’s expression change and reached out to pull Mother Jiang. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The Jiang family could only rely on this daughter now.

Although Father Jiang was unhappy with Jiang Luoli’s behavior, he held it in for his son.

Mother Jiang was furious. She turned around and glared at Father Jiang. “Am I wrong? She’s a black-hearted person. Xiao Hai is a descendant of the Jiang family. If anything happens to him, I won’t let her off.”

Jiang Luoli thought that she could calm down.

She was used to being treated differently since she was young.

But at this moment, she still felt cold.

Her heart went cold.

As expected, Jiang Hai was the only child in the Jiang family.

She was probably worse than an outsider.

After all, her parents were known to be good people, and the neighbors thought highly of them.

Jiang Luoli felt sad.

She didn’t know why she rushed back.

Was she here to be abused?

“Ah Li, your mom said that out of anger. She’s just worried about Xiao Hai.” Father Jiang was afraid that Jiang Luoli would feel disappointed and leave. He immediately went forward and held her hand. “You’ve just returned, you must be hungry. Go in quickly, I’ll cook you a bowl of noodles. We’ll talk about Xiao Hai later.”

Mother Jiang was about to scold her again.

Father Jiang glared at her coldly. “Are you only willing to let Ah Li go because of anger? No matter what, Xiao Hai can’t be released immediately. If Ah Li didn’t care about Xiao Hai, she wouldn’t have come back.”

Mother Jiang was stunned. Then, she thought that if Jiang Luoli left in anger, no one would care about Jiang Hai anymore.
