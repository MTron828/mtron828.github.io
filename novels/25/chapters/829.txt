Chapter 830: I’m the One Who Saved You That Night

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

If it was in the past, Gong Zeli wouldn’t let her drink anymore.

But now... he didn’t stop her.

Women were very sensitive. Shen Rou could tell that something was wrong with him.

Gong Zeli looked at her deeply and shook his head. “I’m not angry.”

“Then, why did you...”

“Rourou, let’s talk.”

Gong Zeli sat down and crossed his legs. “I think we need to have a good talk.”

Shen Rou was stunned. “Talk? What do you want to talk to me about?”

“A long time ago.”

Shen Rou was stunned again and her heart started racing.

She looked into Gong Zeli’s eyes and felt a little flustered for some reason.

This feeling had appeared a few days ago when he asked her if she’d lied to him.

She took a deep breath and tried her best to remain calm.

“What happened a long time ago?” She raised her brows curiously. “What are you trying to say? Why do I feel like you’re acting strangely today?”

“Am I weird?” Gong Zeli smiled. “Perhaps. I think we shouldn’t beat around the bush. Rourou, what I want to talk to you about is something that happened 10 years ago. Perhaps, you should know what I want to talk to you about.”

Shen Rou widened her eyes in shock.

Gong Zeli looked at her and said calmly, “Back then, at my birthday party, I fell into the water and was saved. The person who saved me wasn’t you, right?”

“W-What did you say?”

The wine glass in Shen Rou’s hand slipped and fell to the floor.

The floor was covered with tiles.

The glass shattered the moment it hit the ground.

Gong Zeli’s last bit of hope vanished when he saw her reaction.

She really... lied to him.

She’d treated him like a fool for 10 years.

But why would she do that?

She clearly didn’t like him and wasn’t willing to accept him, but she had to fabricate such a lie for him to guard her for 10 whole years.

He didn’t know why she did that.

“Actually, I should have guessed it a long time ago.” Gong Zeli smiled self-mockingly. “So many feelings were wrong, but I never thought that the person that night wasn’t you at all. I was really a fool. I believed everything you said.

“Shen Rou, can I ask why you lied?

“What’s the point of doing that?

“Didn’t you dislike me? Why did you lie to me? You made me think that you were the one who saved me that night?”

Shen Rou turned pale.

She looked at him in shock and fear, unable to say a word.

How could...

How did he know that it wasn’t her?

It had been 10 years since that incident. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He had never doubted her for the past 10 years.

Why did he suddenly...

“Zeli, w-what are you talking about? I was the one who saved you that night, who else could it be?” Shen Rou calmed down after a moment of panic.

She felt that Gong Zeli didn’t know the truth.

Just like that day, he was just suspicious of her.

He had no evidence.

It had been 10 years since that night.
