“Since you’ve already made up your mind, we’ll do as you wish. But I think you can consider this matter again. Don’t rush to make a decision.”

Qiao Chen nodded. “Dad, I’ll consider it.”

Mo Xingshu nodded. “It’s a good thing to get a high ranking. Shall we celebrate?”

Qiao Chen thought for a while and said, “Then, let’s have a meal together. There’s no need to specially hold a banquet.”

“Mm.” Mo Xingshu said, “Let’s have a meal together, then. Oh right, your grandma has been concerned about your college entrance examination results. Now that the results are out, you should tell her.”

“Alright.”

“Also…” Mo Xingshu’s expression suddenly became a little lonely and sad. He kept quiet for a while before saying, “Tell your mom, too. I believe she’ll be very happy to see your good results.”

Qiao Chen was stunned for a moment before a hint of sadness appeared in his eyes.

Not long after he was born, he was separated from his mother.

And they never saw each other again.

But the thought of that poor woman still made him sad.

…

Mo Xingshu stayed in Qiao Chen’s room for a while before leaving.

Qiao Chen sat in front of the computer and looked at the results. He hesitated for a while before picking up his cell phone.

He found the name on the contact list.

His fingers pressed on it, but he couldn’t really press it.

What should he say?

They’d agreed not to disturb each other in the future.

How was he going to explain to her how he got her new cell phone number?

But at this moment, she was the first person Qiao Chen thought of sharing his joy with.

When she left, she said that she’d finally let him off.

But she didn’t know that he wasn’t willing.

He’d thought that after separating and not seeing each other for a while, his feelings for her would slowly fade.

But in fact, they didn’t.

He missed her even more.

He used to see her whenever she was around.

Hence, he didn’t think about what would happen to his life if she was gone.

Until she really left.

She had completely left his life.

Qiao Chen finally felt that her departure had changed him.

Without her in school, it didn’t seem like the same school anymore. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Without her, the atmosphere in the class seemed to have changed.

He went to school every day and saw her seat empty. He felt empty inside.

Happiness didn’t seem so easy anymore.

The thing he thought he would never lose suddenly vanished from his life.

He realized how uncomfortable he was.

He still wasn’t used to it.

One day, he dreamt that she was back.

Just like before, she sat beside him. The moment he entered the classroom, she smiled and waved at him. “Good morning, Qiao Chen. Have you eaten breakfast? I brought it for you.”

“Student Qiao Chen, the weather is so good today. Have you eaten breakfast? If not, I’ll treat you.”

“Student Qiao Chen, although it’s raining today, it’s still a sunny day in my heart.. Do you know why? It’s because if you’re fine, it’s always a sunny day for me, hahaha.”
