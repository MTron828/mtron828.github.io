Chapter 2900: It Seems Like Retribution

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

She couldn’t even stand properly.

She felt her body go soft and weak.

This was different from when she was drunk.

Chairman Lin picked her up and walked towards the bed.

Qiao Anxin was thrown onto the soft bed. In her daze, she saw a few men enter the room that had originally just her and Chairman Lin.

In her daze, she heard a familiar voice. “You can start now. Remember, you have to take a clear picture of her face.”

Qiao Anxin felt as if someone had hit her on the head. She widened her eyes and looked in the direction of the voice, but she couldn’t see anything.

It was a blur.

Before Qiao Anxin completely lost consciousness, she heard that familiar voice again. “Do whatever you want, the more tricks the better. You have the whole night, don’t waste it.”

“Yes, Mr. Su. Don’t worry. We’ll definitely make the video very exciting. We won’t let you down.”

…

Qiao Mianmian took two days off and flew back to C City to continue filming “My Intern Parents”. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

During the two days that she was delayed, the director filmed the others first. When she returned, he got her to film some scenes, but it didn’t delay their progress much.

The shoot went smoothly.

A week after Qiao Mianmian returned to C City, Qiao Chen called and said that something happened to Qiao Anxin.

“I heard that she was raped by a few men and even had videos taken. Those videos were uploaded online, and everyone knows about it now. Qiao Anxin said that Su Ze was the one who harmed her and went to look for him with a knife, saying that she wanted to die with him.

“When she was arguing with Su Ze, she was stabbed a few times by him. She’s still in the hospital now, and we don’t know if she’s dead or alive. But I heard from the hospital that her chances of survival are relatively low.

“Su Ze is detained in the police station. He stabbed someone in public, so there are many witnesses. Whether Qiao Anxin can survive or not, he’ll definitely be sentenced. Moreover, once they find out that he’s the one behind Qiao Anxin’s video, he’ll also be punished for it. Even if he doesn’t get the death sentence, he’ll probably be in jail for the rest of his life.

Qiao Mianmian was shocked.

It took her a while to recover.

“You’re saying that Qiao Anxin was stabbed by Su Ze? And he’s now locked up in the police station?”

“Mm, this happened not long ago. It probably hasn’t appeared on the news. But I’ve already gotten someone to ask, so it can’t be fake.”

Qiao Mianmian was shocked again.

She couldn’t describe how she felt.

Qiao Anxin and Su Ze were the two people she most detested.

One of them was her childhood sweetheart who almost married her.

The other was her sister who grew up with her.

But they colluded and betrayed her.

Qiao Mianmian had hated Su Ze and Qiao Anxin before. She had also secretly cursed them in her heart, hoping that they would suffer retribution.

Now…

This adulterous pair seemed to have really suffered retribution.

Qiao Anxin was still alive.

Su Ze was detained, and he wouldn’t have a good ending.

If this was retribution, then their retribution was satisfying.
