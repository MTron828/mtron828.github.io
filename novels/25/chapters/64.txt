Chapter 65: Silly Girl, Don’t Be Shameless

Qiao Mianmian had seen tons of men like Du Ze.

Before Su Ze came along, many rich second-generation heirs pursued her too.

She couldn’t be clearer about their thoughts.

They simply wanted her for her looks, but after playing with her for a while, they would toss her aside.

None of these men was true.

She was extremely averse to them.

She didn’t feel that Du Ze deserved any respect, so she simply said coldly, “Excuse me, but I don’t have the time. Moreover, I don’t have an interest in having a meal with you.”

Du Ze’s expression turned awful at having been rejected upfront in front of everyone. With a dark expression, when he spoke again, it was with a voice filled with tension. “Don’t you know Sheng Hui Corporation?”

Qiao Mianmian sneered. “Hm, I don’t know. Why, is it very famous? I haven’t heard of it.”

Du Ze looked even more awful now.

Rich second-generation heirs like him usually stuck around friends who fawned all over him. And when it came to girls, they practically threw themselves at him. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

This was the first time a girl rejected and embarrassed him over and over again.

He was getting frustrated. “Silly girl, don’t be shameless. I’m asking you one more time, are you going or not?”

Seeing that Du Ze was angered, Shen Yueyue and Zhao Wanting felt better.

Qiao Mianmian was a slut, a shameless one.

Du Ze was upset now, and it was the best time to teach her a lesson.

The two of them added fuel to fire. “Qiao Mianmian, it’s your blessing that Brother Du Ze sees something in you. Who are you to reject him?”

“Brother Du Ze, you should punish an ignorant woman like her.”

Jiang Luoli saw that the situation was turning bad and couldn’t see the “rescuers” that Qiao Mianmian talked about. Afraid that Qiao Mianmian would be in trouble, she discreetly sent Su Ze a message after much hesitation.

Jiang Luoli: [A few hooligans are finding trouble with Mianmian now. Young Master Su, can you come over to help her out?]

She thought about it.

Although they had broken up, Su Ze couldn’t possibly just ignore her this way, considering they were together for years.

The only person who could save her now was Su Ze.

Su Ze replied instantly: [What’s going on? Where’s Mianmian now?]

Jiang Luoli: [Female dormitory. Young Master Su, come quick. Mianmian is going to be taken advantage of.]

Su Ze: [I’m near the school. Coming now.]

Seeing Su Ze’s response, Jiang Luoli immediately heaved a sigh of relief.

If he was nearby, he would be there soon.

Just as Jiang Luoli sent her final message, she saw Du Ze making a move. “Bitch, I’ve tolerated you enough. You think too highly of yourself. You’re coming with me whether you like it or not, don’t make me use force.”

“I’ve seen too many girls like you. Aren’t you out to sell your body, anyway? All I have is money. Is a million yuan a night enough for you?! I’ve got more!”

Du Ze finally showed his true colors.

He grabbed Qiao Mianmian’s hand and reached for a bill in his wallet, then threw it at her face.

“Don’t act all noble. You’re just used goods. You’d better know where you stand and follow me obediently. Otherwise, don’t blame me for turning rough!”

“Mianmian! Let go of Mianmian!” Jiang Luoli stepped forward in an attempt to help her out but was stopped by a few other men.
