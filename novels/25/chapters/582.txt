Moreover, although that woman was rather good-looking, she was still a notch below Qiao Mianmian.

Especially since that woman had even gone under the knife before.

That nose and that chin... were obviously unnatural. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Meanwhile, Qiao Mianmian was au natural.

Su Ze knew her for 10 whole years. Even 10 years ago, she already looked like a beautiful Barbie. Tons of guys liked her in school.

Qiao Mianmian could barely believe what she’d heard.

She widened her eyes. “What did you say? You want me to give you a chance?”

Was this even something a human would say?

How shameless was he?

That he could say something like that.

“Yes.” Su Ze looked at her deeply. “Mianmian, I know I’m still in your heart. You’re still in mine too. We’ve gone through so many years together, and I’ve only ever loved you. I can’t forget you or the times we’ve spent together.

“I believe that I’m not the only one who still misses those days. You do too, right?”

10 years together.

She couldn’t possibly feel nothing for him.

She was so cold to him and appeared as if she detested him only because she was still angry at how he’d hurt her.

“Mianmian, let’s reconcile.” Su Ze stepped forward and reached out passionately, about to grab her hand. “Anxin and I have already broken up. I’m single now. Give me one more chance and let me make up for my mistakes, alright?

“I swear, I’ll take good care of you for the rest of my life.

“I’ll never do anything to let you down again.”

This time, Qiao Mianmian heard him clearly.

She was stunned to hear that Qiao Anxin and he had broken up. But soon after, her expression blanked as he went on.

Her instinct when he reached out was to evade it, and she did so with a disgusted expression.

Su Ze’s expression was a little awful now.

Qiao Mianmian’s was even more so. She was so grossed out that she almost puked.

She felt she really underestimated how shameless Su Ze was.

“Su Ze, can you not be so disgusting?” Qiao Mianmian couldn’t hold it in any longer. “What has your relationship with Qiao Anxin got to do with me? I don’t even care whether you’re single or not. From the moment we broke up, you’re practically dead to me.

“You want me to give you a chance. But what chance can I give to someone already dead?

“I’m telling you clearly right now.” Qiao Mianmian said coldly, “Even if all other men in the world died, and I’m left to choose between you and a pig, I’d rather choose the pig. I will never get back together with you.”

Su Ze’s dignity had been trampled upon.

He was embarrassed and annoyed to hear.

“Qiao Mianmian, do you even have any self-respect? You’d rather be someone else’s mistress and be played around by him than to be my official, rightful girlfriend?

“What’s so good about that man that you’re willing to be this loyal to him? Is he good in bed and manages to satisfy you? Is that why you can’t leave him?”
