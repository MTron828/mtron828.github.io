Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Anyway, Linda didn’t want to stay in the same company as Qiao Anxin.

Qiao Mianmian was shocked. “Qiao Anhao wants to sign with Huanyu?”

“Yeah.”

“Did President Zhao agree?”

“He hasn’t agreed yet, but I think he wants to sign her. Mianmian, if Qiao Anxin really signed with Huanyu, can you accept it?”

Linda’s reply to Zhao Kai was that he could do whatever he wanted.

She guessed that Zhao Kai would sign Qiao Anxin.

She didn’t really care.

There was some unhappiness between her and Qiao Anxin, but as long as she wasn’t responsible for her, there was nothing she couldn’t accept even if she minded it.

She was more concerned about Qiao Mianmian’s opinion.

“Sister Xie, if the company really wants to sign Qiao Anxin, there’s nothing I can’t accept.” Qiao Mianmian thought for a while before answering Linda. “I can understand the company’s actions.”

To Huanyu, Qiao Anxin would definitely bring more benefits to the company.

Qiao Anxin was already an A-list celebrity.

In fact, no matter how much Qiao Mianmian disliked Qiao Anxin, she had to admit that she couldn’t compare to her now.

Qiao Anxin had made an agreement with Starlight, so it was easy for her to pick a good boss.

After all, she was famous. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Can you really understand?” Linda looked at her. “If Qiao Anxin signs with Huanyu, she’ll be your competitor. Do you really not mind?”

Qiao Mianmian smiled. “Sister Xie, the company will definitely prioritize profits, so I understand the company’s approach. Besides, even if Qiao Anxin and I are in the same company, we won’t see each other every day.”

“Mm, it’s good that you’re able to accept it.” Linda nodded. “If Qiao Anxin really comes to us, don’t worry. I won’t let you lose to her. I won’t let her ride on my artiste just to win her pride.

“I’ve taken care of her for two years, so I know very well how strong she is. After leaving Starlight, she can’t get as many good resources as before, and she can’t be as free as she used to be in Starlight. If she really signs with Huanyu, her development will be limited.

“But you’re different.” Linda looked at Qiao Mianmian with admiration. “You’re much better than Qiao Anxin. You just lack someone to support you. Now that President Zhao knows about your relationship with President Mo, he’ll definitely share some of the good resources with us in the future.

“You’ll be famous in a year or so. I believe you’ll surpass Qiao Anxin soon.”

Qiao Mianmian didn’t doubt Linda’s ability at all.

It could be said that most of Starlight’s A-list celebrities were brought up by her.

Speaking of which, Qiao Anxin was considered to have become popular by Linda’s efforts.

...

Not long after, someone knocked on the door.

Linda stood up to open the door. When she saw the person standing outside, she extended her hand and smiled. “Hello, CEO Zhang. We meet again.”

President Zhang was the regional general manager of MC.

He walked into the room with his secretary and saw Qiao Mianmian. Before Qiao Mianmian could greet him, he quickly extended his hand. “Miss Qiao, right? Hello, nice to meet you.”

Qiao Mianmian was taken aback by his enthusiasm.

She blinked and looked at Linda questioningly, asking her who this man was.
