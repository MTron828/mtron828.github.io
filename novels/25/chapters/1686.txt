Chapter 1689: Qiao Chen, You’ll Misunderstand Me

But her illness was definitely not an ordinary cold.

Shen Xin seemed a little stunned. After a few seconds, she said in a relaxed tone, “Didn’t I say that I had a cold? That’s why I went to the hospital to look for a doctor.”

“But you’re in the hospital.”

“Mm, I have a slight fever, so I got an injection.”

Her tone was too casual.

It really sounded like a cold.

But Qiao Chen didn’t trust her anymore.

He clenched his fists and said, “You’re lying to me. It’s definitely not a cold. Tell me what happened.”

She must have encountered something that prevented her from attending his banquet.

Although Qiao Chen kept his distance from her over the years, he realized that he knew Shen Xin very well.

Shen Xin liked him a lot. She was even infatuated with him.

That’s why she pursued him for three years despite how cold he was to her.

Shen Xin couldn’t possibly miss his birthday party because of a minor cold.

Even if she had a serious cold, she would definitely find a way to go.

She couldn’t come. There was only one possibility, and that was that her illness was so serious that she couldn’t get out of bed.

At this thought, Qiao Chen’s heart started racing.

“Qiao Chen, I’m really fine.” Shen Xin obviously didn’t want to tell him the truth. “I really have a cold. The head nurse told me to stop playing with my phone. I’m hanging up. You...”

“Hospital address, room number.”

“Qiao Chen?”

“I don’t want to repeat myself. Shen Xin, give me your current address.”

“I...”

“If you don’t tell me, I’ll go to every hospital.”

“But your party isn’t over yet.”

“It’s not important. Birthdays are held every year.”

Shen Xin kept quiet for a while. “Qiao Chen, you’ll make me misunderstand.”

Qiao Chen was stunned. “Misunderstanding what?”

Shen Xin: “I’ll wonder if you like me a little and care about me.”

Qiao Chen fell silent.

“I’m really fine. Qiao Chen, have a good birthday. I really have to hang up.” Shen Xin hung up.

Qiao Chen’s expression was tense. He stood there for a while before turning around and walking back to the lobby.

He found Mo Yesi.

“Brother-in-law, can you do me a favor?”

It was rare for his brother-in-law to take the initiative to look for him for help, so Mo Yesi naturally agreed to everything.

He smiled and took a glass of red wine from Qiao Mianmian, warning her not to drink it again.

“What is it?”

Qiao Chen pursed his lips and hesitated for a few seconds before saying slowly, “A friend of mine is hospitalized. I want to visit her at the hospital. But I don’t know which hospital she’s at.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Friend? What friend?” Mo Yesi asked. “You mean you want me to help you investigate someone? In that case, you have to tell me if your friend is a man or a woman. What’s her name?”

Qiao Chen’s expression changed. He kept quiet for a while before saying, “It’s, it’s Shen Xin.”

He felt his face burn.

“Shen Xin?” Mo Yesi smiled and exchanged glances with Qiao Mianmian. “Shen Xin is sick? You’re going to see her now?”
