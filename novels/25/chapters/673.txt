Chapter 674: Is That So? Looks Like I’m Overthinking It

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Is it a Weibo account?”

“Mm.”

“Do you have a lot of fans?”

“Not much, just tens of thousands of fans.”

But they were true fans.

Every time she posted something, there would be hundreds of comments.

Initially, she’d wanted to manage it well. But after Qiao Chen’s sudden relapse and his heart attack, she didn’t have the mood to do so anymore.

She was always thinking about how to cure him.

“Tens of thousands of fans isn’t too bad,” Nana said seriously. “Although many have tens of millions of fans now, only tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of fans are true fans. If tens of thousands are true fans, it’s not bad already.

“Sister Mianmian, why didn’t you update it?”

Qiao Mianmian said roughly, “Something happened at home, so I don’t have time to deal with it.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Oh, I see...”

The two of them chatted as they walked. When they were about to reach the set, they bumped into Huang Yilin.

Huang Yilin saw them too.

She stopped in her tracks and sized Qiao Mianmian up from head to toe. Then, she frowned, and her gaze turned even colder.

Qiao Mianmian also looked at her coldly. Previously, she’d addressed her as Senior Huang, but this time, she didn’t even greet her.

Since Huang Yilin was already hostile towards her, it didn’t matter what she did.

Since that was the case, there was no need for her to maintain her image.

Huang Yilin could tell that Qiao Mianmian’s attitude was different from before.

She looked at her coldly for a while and suddenly smiled. “Miss Qiao, why are you looking at me like that, as if you’re unhappy with me?”

Qiao Mianmian smiled and said, “Senior Huang, you’re thinking too much. You didn’t do anything to let me down, why should I be unhappy with you?”

Huang Yilin’s expression changed slightly. The smile on her lips froze for a few seconds, and the coldness in her eyes intensified. “Is that so? Then, it seems like I’m overthinking it. Miss Qiao’s makeup is pretty good, it seems like the makeup artist this time is pretty good.”

Qiao Mianmian could tell that she was suspecting the makeup artist.

She didn’t explain and simply smiled. “It’s not bad.”

Huang Yilin turned around and glared at her assistant.

The assistant went pale and quickly said, “Sister Yilin, I have...”

As if thinking of something, she looked up and saw Qiao Mianmian standing opposite them. Her face went pale and she immediately shut her mouth.

Huang Yilin glared at the assistant even more fiercely. “Idiot!”

The assistant didn’t dare to say a word. She held onto the umbrella and trembled.

Huang Yilin retracted her gaze from the assistant and glared at Qiao Mianmian. She then turned around and left.

The assistant quickly caught up with her and held the umbrella above her head.

“Pfft, disgusting woman.” After Huang Yilin left, Nana finally let out the anger she’d been holding in. She looked at Huang Yilin’s back view and said, “You pretend in front of others, but I didn’t expect you to be so disgusting.”
