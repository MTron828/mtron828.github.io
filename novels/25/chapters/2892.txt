Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

She could tell that Lin Huizhen didn’t care about their relationship.

Since that was the case, there was nothing for her to worry about. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

…

In the end, Lin Huizhen and Qiao Anxin stayed in a small hotel.

Small hotels were cheaper than big hotels, but the living environment was very poor.

Qiao Anxin paid a fine and did not have much money left. She could only stay in a small hotel like this for a few days.

The air in the small, old room was filled with an unpleasant moldy smell, mixed with the stench of sweat that probably came from the neighboring room.

Qiao Anxin sat on the unwashed bedsheets with a dark face, her expression unbearable.

She had never stayed in such a terrible place before.

Even when she was at her lowest, her food and lodging were not too bad because of Su Ze.

However, Su Ze didn’t care about her anymore, and she didn’t have any money. She wouldn’t be able to stay in such a small hotel for a long time.

If she couldn’t get money within the next few days, she would really end up sleeping on the streets.

“What kind of lousy place is this? How can people live here?” Lin Huizhen covered her nose and ran to the window to take a breather. She didn’t expect to find a rundown restaurant below. A thick stench drifted up from the restaurant and directly landed on her face.

Lin Huizhen almost vomited.

She stomped her feet in anger. “Can we change places? Is this a place for humans?”

Qiao Anxin’s lips twitched and she laughed sarcastically. “Sure, just give me the money. Mom, don’t blame me for not reminding you. We can’t even stay in this small hotel for long. After a few days, we’ll be sleeping on the streets.”

Lin Huizhen’s expression changed and she kept quiet.

After a while, she stammered, “Then… then what should we do? We have to find a way to get more money.”

Qiao Anxin said nothing.

She tugged at her hair in frustration.

Of course, she knew that she had to think of a way to earn some money.

She didn’t want to sleep on the streets.

However, what could she do now?

Just as Qiao Anxin was feeling anxious and at a loss, her phone suddenly rang.

It was Su Ze.

Qiao Anxin stared at her phone screen for a few seconds before answering the call.

“Su Ze, you have the nerve to call me?” After picking up the call, Qiao Anxin scolded him agitatedly. “Did you get someone to chase Mom and me out? Su Ze, you’re a bastard. Scum!”

Qiao Anxin was fumed and vented her anger.

“Aren’t you kicking me to the curb after I’ve outlived my usefulness because you’re afraid that I’ll hinder your bright future? Let me tell you, you’ve hurt me so badly. Do you think you can continue your carefree life as you wish? Stop dreaming.

“I’ll find a way to meet Gong Zeli and tell him about our collaboration. Don’t forget, we’re on the same boat. If we’re going to die, we’ll all die together!”

Su Ze didn’t say anything.

When Qiao Anxin finished venting and stopped scolding him, he said slowly, “Are you done? Listen to me, then.”

Qiao Anxin was angered again. “What else do you want to say?”

“Qiao Anxin, don’t be so agitated. Listen to me first. I think you’ve misunderstood me. I just found out that you and Aunt Lin were out.. I didn’t do it.”
