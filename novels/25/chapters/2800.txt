And when he went in to put out the fire, he saw a ball of black stuff in a pot on the stove.

He couldn’t tell exactly what it was.

Li Wei sized him up from head to toe and heaved a sigh of relief after confirming that he was alright.

“It’s good that you’re alright.” He patted his chest, wanting to say that he was scared to death just now. Thankfully, the fire was out and he was fine.

“Why did the kitchen catch fire?” Li Wei asked with a frown.

There was a smoke alarm in the kitchen.

The sound of the alarm was probably heard from upstairs and downstairs.

Hence, he hurried over.

Zhan Bo kept quiet for a while before saying, “Jiang Xinyue was cooking. I’m not sure about the details, I’ll ask her later.”

Li Wei was speechless when he heard that.

But he didn’t say anything else. He nodded and said, “Mm, let’s go out first. The smoke in the house is rather heavy, don’t choke on it. I’ll have to get someone to clean the kitchen later. I don’t think you can stay in this room.”

Zhan Bo nodded.

When they walked out of the room, they saw the other guests waiting outside. Seeing Li Wei and Zhan Bo come out, Qin Han went forward and asked, “I heard that there was a fire. Is it serious? Has it been put out?”

“It’s been put out.” Zhan Bo looked at Jiang Xinyue and saw that she was standing there in a daze. She didn’t even have the intention to greet him. He couldn’t help but feel uncomfortable.

After all, this fire was caused by her.

Qiao Mianmian and the rest came too.

The smoke in the corridor was so thick that everyone in the other rooms could smell it.

“Zhan Bo, are you alright?” Qiao Mianmian asked worriedly.

She heard that he went in to put out the fire.

Although the fire wasn’t very big, it was still dangerous.

“Mm, I’m fine, don’t worry.” Qiao Mianmian’s greeting warmed Zhan Bo’s heart.

He looked at Jiang Xinyue again and thought that no matter how similar her face was, she was still different.

He didn’t expect her to be grateful.

But at least, she should show some concern.

Or rather, thank him.

She shouldn’t think that everything he did was natural.

His change in opinion of Jiang Xinyue was quickly lost.

“How did it happen?” Qin Han asked. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Zhan Bo was about to answer when he heard a childish voice say, “She did it.”

Doudou pointed at Jiang Xinyue. “She set the kitchen on fire. Daddy Zhan carried me out, and she ran out too. Then, Daddy Zhan ran in again.”

Everyone turned to look at Jiang Xinyue.

Qiao Anxin wanted to perform well, but she didn’t expect to cause a fire.

She didn’t do well and even caused trouble.

The target of everyone’s gazes, she was furious, but when she turned around, she looked weak and pitiful.

She bit her lip as her eyes reddened. “I’m sorry, I’ve caused trouble for everyone. I didn’t expect it to be like this. I don’t know why the kitchen caught on fire. I didn’t do it on purpose, I really didn’t…”

Tears rolled down her cheeks.

The others couldn’t say anything.
