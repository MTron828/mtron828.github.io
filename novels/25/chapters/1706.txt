“Even I lost to you, let alone others.”

Qiao Mianmian was speechless.

Why did she feel like she was being flirted with again?

“You lost to me?” She raised her head and looked at the man’s handsome face with her dark eyes. When she met those deep eyes full of gentleness and love, her heart started beating faster.

Mo Yesi looked down at her, curled the corners of his lips, and said with a hushed voice, “Mm, I’ve fallen completely from body to heart. But it was entirely voluntarily and willingly.”

Qiao Mianmian was stunned. Her heart pounded even faster.

What if her husband was flirting with her all the time?

I needed help... stat!

...

A few days after the shoot, Qiao Mianmian and Qin Han’s “If You Can’t Love” trailer was officially released. The date of the show’s release was also set.

The official trailer was over 10 minutes long. After it was broadcasted, the response was unanimous.

Because of Qin Han and Director Bai Yusheng’s drama, coupled with Qiao Mianmian, who was a trending topic, the focus was especially high. Once the clip was released, it was reposted by fans and passersby.

The show hadn’t even started broadcasting, but it was already trending on the news.

Qin Han was a top-notch actor, so his acting skills were well-known.

Some of the supporting actors were also capable with many works under their belts, and their performances were as stable as ever. Only Qiao Mianmian, the “flower vase actress” who’d been slandered countless times and relied on her connections to get the role, was praised on the hot searches.

Some passersby expressed that Qiao Mianmian’s acting was seriously incompatible with her appearance.

Because her looks were standard.

As for the other female actresses in the industry, they were really pretty.

But Qiao Mianmian was an “antique vase” with good looks and acting skills.

Not only was it beautiful, but it was also very useful.

Her fans naturally praised her.

The passersby said, “Initially, I wasn’t interested in this show because the female lead was Qiao Mianmian. But after watching the trailer, I feel it is worth watching.”

“What’s going on, am I crazy? I actually feel that Qiao Mianmian and Qin Han are a couple. Someone come and scold me, how can I have such thoughts!”

“It looks pretty good. Qiao Mianmian has a fairy-like personality while Qin Han is cold and domineering. I find their characters and storyline interesting. The domineering CEO is in love with the cold little fairy?”

“Gosh, Qin Han is so good at being a boyfriend. The wall against the wall is so sexy. Ahhh, I want to be pinned against the wall by him.”

“I’m actually looking forward to the main show. I think it’s best not to take sides so easily before really understanding it. Back then, I said that Qiao Mianmian didn’t have acting skills and got the female lead role purely because of her connections. Now, it doesn’t seem like that. At least, I think her acting is pretty good.”

“I’m not exaggerating. Her acting is really good. She’s still a newbie, and it’s already very good that she can act so well with a Movie King like Qin Han. Qin Han doesn’t praise people easily, and he has praised Qiao Mianmian’s acting several times. I don’t think he said good things for Qiao Mianmian because someone forced him to. I think he really admires this junior.”
