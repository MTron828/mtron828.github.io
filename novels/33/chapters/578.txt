Chapter 579: It‚Äôs Time

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

After checking the changes from entering the Calamity Grade, Han Xiao tidied up his clothes before walking out of the training room.

As he walked down the corridor of the base, he met Aroshia.

‚ÄúWhere are you going?‚Äù

‚ÄúBack to my room.‚Äù Aroshia was prepared to walk past Han Xiao but suddenly paused beside Han Xiao and began sniffing him with a strange look in her eyes.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter? Do I smell good?‚Äù Han Xiao then looked down at his own body.

Aroshia shook her head, and a look of uncertainty could be seen on her usually calm face. When she walked past Han Xiao, she could sense something different about Han Xiao‚Äôs aura, and she thought that her senses were wrong.

‚ÄúWhat kind of change have you undergone?‚Äù Aroshia would never beat about the bush and went straight to the point.

‚ÄúOh? You have felt it? I achieved a breakthrough in my strength, and I am already at the Calamity Grade.‚Äù Han Xiao did not bother hiding anything. His Officers would find out eventually anyway.

Aroshia nodded indifferently in response. To her, regardless of what Han Xiao did, she would never doubt him in the slightest. Besides, Han Xiao had just survived a huge battle, and it was extremely normal for him to achieve a breakthrough.

To NPCs like them without an interface, battling was indeed the best way to raise their strength.

Han Xiao suddenly thought about something and smiled.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be in a rush to leave. Let me show you a little trick.‚Äù

As he said that, Han Xiao activated his [Chaos Entity ‚Äì Release], and his entire body turned into a grayish fog.

Aroshia looked at the fog before her with her eyes wide open in shock. Such a domain like transformation was extremely similar to her energy body. As she stretched out her hands to touch the fog; her entire hand passed through the fog, and she could not feel anything. The grayish fog before her was no different from an ordinary fog.

Hum!

Aroshia transformed her own body into her energy form and entered the grayish fog. The glowing golden energy body was tangled together with the grayish fog, and she could feel a warm sensation that she would only feel when present in the energy furnace.

Upon thinking about charging, Aroshia subconsciously attempted to absorb energy from the grayish fog. However, the Chaos Body was maintained by Han Xiao‚Äôs energy, and this energy was controlled by Han Xiao. Thus, it could not be absorbed by Aroshia.

Feeling Aroshia‚Äôs action, Han Xiao released a small portion of his energy for Aroshia to absorb. Aroshia suddenly turned into a bright ball of light that began flickering. Absorbing the energy from the Chaos Body made her feel a great sense of comfort, and she could not even be bothered to maintain her human form. If not for the fact that she did not have vocal cords in her energy form, she would have let out a groan of satisfaction.

The energy of a Calamity Grade Super was far thicker, and it had the brand of Han Xiao‚Äôs genes. Thus, it naturally felt extremely different from an energy furnace.

Energy was the HP of the Chaos Body, and with a small portion of his energy being absorbed, Han Xiao‚Äôs HP decreased. Han Xiao was then surprised to realize that he could send a telepathic message with the Chaos Body and sent Aroshia a message. He asked her to channel some of her energy into the gray fog as well. Theoretically, the both of them should be able to exchange their energy.

A golden streak of energy was then transmitted into the gray fog, and the HP of his Chaos Body was filled up to the brim. Han Xiao was suddenly struck by a thought. Because the majority of his talents were locked up in his Chaos Body form, Aroshia was not only his ‚Äòbattery‚Äô but was also a moving HP potion for him.

He then sent another thought to Aroshia, and Aroshia transformed into the Chaos Body form to merge together with the gray fog. The gray fog immediately shone with a golden tint, and the two of them were able to have a deeper connection, which increased the efficiency of their energy transfer. This was akin to Aroshia becoming one with the Chaos Body.

After experimenting for a moment, Han Xiao deactivated the Chaos Body and transformed back to his original body. Aroshia also separated from his body and cancelled her energy form.

‚ÄúIs this your new ability?‚Äù Aroshia could not help but ask. For some reason, her beautiful face had a slightly red hue.

‚ÄúYeah, I have acquired Void abilities.‚Äù

Han Xiao‚Äôs expression was a little odd, and he felt as though he had just done something strange.

Shaking his head, Han Xiao disposed of all the strange thoughts in his head. He then tried to think back about what he had just felt. Because his Chaos Body was a domain type lifeform that also had energy as its lifeline, he had tried experimenting with Aroshia. In the end, things were as he had expected, and as long as they were connected and consciously willed it, they would be able to transmit energy to each other.

However, while Aroshia could take the initiative to absorb energy, the Chaos Body could not. The Chaos Body could only passively absorb energy from its surroundings. Aroshia‚Äôs Esper ability had another defining feature. She could make use of energy in almost every form possible.

The talents of the Chaos Observer are special, and there should be many more ways to use it, Han Xiao thought to himself.

After entering the Calamity Grade, Han Xiao had many new abilities that he had to familiarize himself with.

He then casually threw an [Observer‚Äôs Mark] onto Aroshia before parting ways.

Along the way, Han Xiao thought about Risda‚Äôs request. He did not intend to go back on his word. When Risda completed his mission, he would aid Aroshia in regaining her memories.

In any case, Han Xiao could already more or less guess what the final mission requirement of [Reboot] would be. He just had to ensure that he did not need to face Manison from the [Mechanic Empire].

...

Over the next few days, the various officers of the Mercenary Group found out about Han Xiao stepping into the Calamity Grade. Compared to Aroshia‚Äôs calmness, they were all shocked.

That was the Calamity Grade!

Before their captain reached the Calamity Grade, he could already tank the attacks from three Calamity Grade Supers. Now that he had joined the ranks of the Calamity Grade Supers, just how powerful would he be‚ÄΩ √öpTodated ùíèovùíÜls on ùíèo(v)ùíÜl()bin(.)cùíêm

The person who was most shocked was naturally Herlous. He had joined the Black Star Mercenary Group before Han Xiao had entered Grade B and had personally watched how Han Xiao caught up to him, exceeded him, and left him in the dust without any hope of catching up!

Han Xiao had gone from Grade C to Grade A in just a short few years‚ÄΩ

Herlous had only touched the boundary of Grade B+!

He had never heard of such a growth rate before! Just what did Han Xiao eat when growing up‚ÄΩ

Sylvia was the happiest. After living together with the mercenaries for the past few years, she treated the Black Star Army as her second home.

There was finally a Calamity Grade Super to prop up the Black Star Army, and Black Star was also her own teacher. Thus, she naturally felt it a great honor.

However, the officers of the Black Star Army had not seen Han Xiao much over the past few days as he had locked himself up in the machinery modification room.

Entering Grade A was the prerequisite to merging a few blueprints, and Han Xiao could upgrade his equipment again. He did not need to change the type of equipment that he equipped but could use more powerful equipment of the same type. Han Xiao had lost a large number of machines during the battle, and this was the best time to make up for the gap in his weapons.

The Void Dragon had already been destroyed, and the only thing left of it was the core material, Void Dragon Bone. Han Xiao merged a new blueprint that was of a higher grade and was prepared to construct a new and more powerful battle suit to keep up with his Calamity Grade strength.

There were three core materials to the new mechanical suit: Kyle Alloy, PR-909 Super Nano Polymer Fiber, and Refined Overga Metal. These were all military grade materials and were extremely pricey. Furthermore, the ones controlling these materials were civilizations of the Star Cluster Grade.

These three materials were considered strategic military resources being used for transactions between civilizations and could not be found on the market at all. As long as it appeared on the black market, it would be purchased anonymously within seconds. Just a kilogram of Kyle Alloy would be the same price as a small spaceship. It was a market with demand but no supply. Even if one had the money and wanted to purchase it, it was impossible to do so.

However, as the ruler of a galactic civilization, Godora would have some in stock that they had bought from Star Cluster grade civilizations.

When he was selling the Mutation Source, one of the conditions was for Godora to allow him to purchase these restricted materials.

However, while Godora did agree to his condition, they added one of their own. The amount of restricted materials that he could purchase annually was limited. Godora would not allow too much of those restricted materials to enter the outside world.

Taking out his communicator, Han Xiao wanted to contact Nagakin to purchase the materials. However, he never imagined that Nagakin would be the first to speak when the call connected.

‚ÄúBlack Star, it is time,‚Äù Nagakin said in a solemn tone.

As Han Xiao heard that, he placed the matter of purchasing the materials aside and said with his eyes narrowed, ‚ÄúIs Godora ready?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe fleet has been deployed, and all the DarkStar motherships are within our grasp. The head will command an attack very soon. This is a confidential mission, and its code name is [Operation Hodellas]!‚Äù

This code name was a direct translation from an ancient Godoran language, which meant ‚Äòuprooting the enemy‚Äô and ‚Äòcutting the weeds at the root‚Äô.

Han Xiao‚Äôs face was solemn. From the day he sold the intelligence to Godora, he knew that such a day would arrive. Godora was currently starting their retaliation against DarkStar, and this was all caused by him.

Such an event did not happen in his past life.

‚ÄúBlack Star, we need you,‚Äù Nagakin said.

Hearing that, Han Xiao became slightly excited as he said with a teasing smile, ‚ÄúHeh, you must know that providing intelligence and personally joining the battle are two different things. Are you officially hiring me?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe will give you remuneration that will make you satisfied. It will be of the same level as the large sized mercenary groups like the Sky Ring Army.‚Äù

Han Xiao intended to join the battle anyway and was only casually mentioning the matter of remuneration. However, he never imagined that Godora would be willing to pay him the same amount as the other large mercenary groups.

It seemed like Godora wanted to get rid of DarkStar at all costs.

After causing them so much trouble for so many years, Godora was already thoroughly enraged at DarkStar. As long as they had an outlet to vent their anger, their attack would be akin to the avalanche of a snowy mountain.

Without their ability to remain hidden, DarkStar had to suffer the rage of Godora without being prepared in the slightest.

It was finally time for both parties to resolve their many years of hatred and enmity.

This was also an opportunity for Han Xiao to complete the [Godora‚Äôs Ally] mission and perhaps an important part of the [Bloodline] mission.

Hanging up the communicator, Han Xiao stroked his chin and called Herlous over.

‚ÄúOl‚Äô Her, we have a job to do. Gather all the mercenaries and prepare to set off.‚Äù

‚ÄúIncluding the new Inhumans?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, everyone.‚Äù

Han Xiao revealed a smile.

This intergalactic battle would be the opportunity for him to take the players into the galaxy! It did not seem too bad.

It was time to let the galaxy have a new understanding of the Black Star Army!
