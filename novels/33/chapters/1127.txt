Chapter 1128 No Such Person Found

“Crossed paths? Show me what he looks like.”

Han Xiao was curious.

Aesop took out the communicator and showed a 3D portrait.

This was a pale-skinned man who looked like he was from Planet Aquamarine. Han Xiao sized him up for quite some time but did not seem to find this person in his memories.

“That’s weird, I’ve never seen this person before. Anyway, I’ll let people look for this person on Planet Aquamarine.”

Since he was part of Aesop’s prophecy, this person was definitely involved in something important. He did not know if it was a good thing or not that this person had arrived on Planet Aquamarine. After all, Planet Aquamarine was his mother planet, so he had to worry about its safety.

“What you just said was the first thing. What’s the second?”

“I’ve foreseen history repeating itself.” Aesop frowned slightly, a little confused.

Han Xiao’s eyes sparkled. “You’re saying...”

“In my visions, many people who died long ago reappeared in the world. I even saw some of the Primordial Ones.”

Could it be the event of the Holy Accord reviving Beyond Grade As? If Aesop felt this future too, then the trigger of that would most likely be his deal with Oathkeeper.

“Hmm? You don’t seem surprised about this prophecy?” Aesop wondered. “I have some knowledge about this.” Han Xiao rubbed his chin and asked, “By the way, do you know about...”

He briefly asked Aesop about the Holy Accord, Oathkeeper, the Sanctums, and all those related matters, hoping that an Eternal like Aesop who traveled around would know something others did not. Sadly, Aesop shook his head and expressed that he had not heard about those things.

However, when mentioning Oathkeeper, he seemed to recall something. “This higher dimension spiritual projection ability that completely ignores distance you’ve mentioned is not common. It might sound easy, but it’s extremely difficult to do. Most spirit-related Esper and Psychics Abilities won’t be able to achieve it. If this is not his own Esper Ability, then it’s quite similar to a legendary Primal Esper Ability Entity-Soul Flame.”

Having heard the term Primal Esper Ability, Han Xiao knew this was probably the case, so he asked, “What else do you know?”

“Soul Flame is one of the Super High Risk Esper Abilities. There have been no witness reports of it for many years... Oh, but you should already know that, so I won’t go over that. Tell you something you don’t know, in my early years wandering the universe, I seem to recall that I once had a prophecy. That prophecy warned me that if I did this one thing, a person who used the Soul Flame would suddenly appear and try to control me, making me help him search for something. Hence, thanks to that prophecy, I avoided that thing and stopped it from happening. That guy might be the Oathkeeper you spoke of, and this is the only information I have about him.”

After communication for a while, Han Xiao realized that this was all Aesop knew about Oathkeeper, so he stopped asking him and remembered the name ‘Soul Flame’. He planned to go back and ask the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy and Holy Light Particle. They were both members of the Primal Esper Ability family, so they might know more.

Furthermore, Primal Esper Ability Entities had existed for a very long time. If the two of them knew whose hands Soul Flame last ended up in, he might find out more about the Holy Accord organization. “Since you have some knowledge about this, I won’t say too much.” Aesop pointed a third finger and said with a serious tone, “There’s one last prophecy. I saw that a universal-level disaster is now brewing somewhere we can’t see.”

“Are you talking about the Intelligent Plague? Then your prophecy might have expired.”

“Do I look like I’m kidding?” Aesop asked. “I saw wormholes that were millions of miles large opening in cosmic space one after another, countless fleets swarming out from within, and the occurrence of a galactic war comparable to the exploration era. No one will be able to avoid it.”

Han Xiao’s eyes turned solemn. That sounds like the invasion of the World Tree Civilization.

Prophecies occurred for a reason. There were definitely some causes or changes that caused Aesop to have this prophecy. This meant that the World Tree storyline had progressed.

Han Xiao immediately thought of the wormhole coordinates from the past, which was outrageously difficult to pin down and required absolute accuracy.

He had made limited progress, so was the dynasty able to find something?

Looks like I’ll have to find the time to ask around about it. Back when EsGod accidentally obtained the wormhole coordinates, I already knew that the World Tree storyline would change... Han Xiao shook his head.

Aesop stood up, stretched his waist, and casually said, “I’ve delivered the prophecies to you, so I’ll leave the rest to you. I’ll also notify you if there are any new prophecies.”

He deliberately told these prophecies to Han Xiao but not Ames because it would not make a difference even if Ames knew; she would only see it as a story. Only Black Star would do something about it.

Han Xiao was about to send Aesop out the door, but Aesop waved and told him there was no need to. However, he suddenly stopped at the doorstep, as if he had thought of something, turned around, and said, “By the way, I’ve got to tell you something. While I was waiting for you, I did some prophecies on your subordinates to kill time. This kid called Harrison has quite a bright future. His string of fate is very thick, and it’s deviated from its original path.”

Then, Aesop opened the door and left. Han Xiao turned to look at Harrison, who was completely at a loss. Han Xiao was not surprised.

He had dragged Harrison with him, so of course, his string of fate had deviated. The World Tree war would very likely erupt earlier, and it was uncertain if Harrison would sacrifice himself like he did in Han Xiao’s previous life.

Han Xiao committed the three prophecies to memory. Although they were all quite blurry, Aesop did indirectly provide some key information to him, so he had more clues.

Currently, the best thing to do was to look for that person Aesop spoke of first. Han Xiao gave the portrait of the target to Phillip and told him to monitor the entire planet. He then summoned the Black Star Army members who were stationed on Planet Aquamarine and sent them out to search all over the planet.

With his power on Planet Aquamarine, he could find even a tiny mouse if he wanted to, not to mention a person.

My name is Rody Anchor, 48 years old, a citizen of Ice Forest City, Maple County, Planet Aquamarine. My house is on No.107 Morning Light Street, Block B 1511. My ID is 77054591A62H. I’m currently working at the Fero Organization Subdivision three streets away. I’m the vice-manager of the operation department.

My parents are survivors of the old era. They died during a riot caused by the Mutation Disaster. Back then, I was just an ignorant child. The disaster caused the majority of the city’s residents to flee. The shops were robbed clean, and burnt cars were everywhere on the roads. I lived a few weeks in a waste of a city like this and was finally found by the Black Star Army’s rescue team. Thanks to that, I was brought to life in the Sanctuary.

After that, His Excellency Black Star got rid of the Mutation Disaster, and I was sent to Public Orphanage No.87. After receiving therapy from Ms. Martha for six years, I finally got over my childhood trauma. My social anxiety, depression, and other illnesses were cured.

After that, my life felt like it was fast-forwarding. Went to school, graduated, entered society, participated in rebuilding Planet Aquamarine, kept changing jobs, kept moving houses, had one girlfriend after another, experienced two failed marriages... The tides of the fast-developing times dragged me along with its extremely quick pace. Like everyone in the same era as me, I worked hard to contribute to society and the new era. With my very own eyes, I witnessed the unbelievably quick development progress of Planet Aquamarine after it connected with the galactic society.

However, as I grew older, my ambition started to shrink. Instead, I started to miss my parents more and more. Five years ago, I decided to quit my job in a large company in Black Star City and returned to my parents’ home, Ice Forest City. My home city had finished being rebuilt. I bought a house in this city, found a new job, and started living here.

The new job is very relaxing. The intensely competitive environment I experienced in the capital does not exist here. Life is like a quiet lake. I meet the same people every day. I’m old now, and I have noticed I’ve grown a liking for a slow life. Very quickly, I fell in love with this peaceful life.

Galaxy Calendar Year 731 July 16th, I can still vividly recall that sunny morning. I woke up early and washed up, as usual, preparing to take out the leftover dinner from the previous day and heat it up as breakfast.

However, when I was brushing my teeth, I suddenly realized that I could not see myself in the mirror!

Horror gripped my heart. I had no idea what happened. I cowered in the corner of the washroom and looked around anxiously as if a monster was going to jump out any minute. I spent more than a minute in that state, shivering in the corner. Then, I finally found the courage to sprint out of the washroom. Without even having the guts to put my shoes on, I hastily grabbed my keys and rushed out of my house, pressing the elevator button rapidly like a mad man.

I lived in a condominium that’s thirty-three floors high. It had four elevators. At the morning peak period, the elevators always automatically went up to the top floor before slowly descending, stopping on almost every floor. Usually, I would watch the morning news while waiting for the elevator, but seconds felt like years at that time. I almost wanted to pry the elevator door open and pull the elevator down.

Finally, the lift arrived at where I lived, floor fifteen. The door opened, and it was completely filled with people. Usually, when I came across something like this, I would always greet my neighbors inside with a smile and wait for the next lift. However, I completely threw all that aside at that time. I grabbed onto the door and screamed at them, describing what had just happened to me.

However, I quickly realized no one was looking at me. No one was listening to me. It was as if I did not exist!

As I was drowning in panic and fear, the people inside noticed that the lift door was not closing, so the person standing by the buttons rapidly pressed on the closing button impatiently. Someone even reached out and tried to slap the door, and that person’s hand just happened to land on my arm.

Something happened that made me even more horrified—this person’s hand easily passed through my arm like I was just an illusion.

Before my brain could even react to it, my sight started to ripple, and I saw an illusion. A lady in the lift did not hold on to the communicator in her hand properly, and it dropped onto the floor.

At this instant, an immense pain erupted in my body. I lost control of my body, fell onto the floor, and started twitching all over. My sight quickly turned blurry, and a powerful sense of drowsiness rushed up to my brain.

The moment before I passed out, I faintly saw a communicator that was exactly the same as the one I saw in the illusion earlier, and I saw it drop onto the floor inside the lift.

The next second, I lost consciousness.

When I woke up again, it was already night, and I was still lying on the floor outside the lift. A sense of overwhelming weakness pervaded my body as if I hadn’t eaten or slept for two whole days.

The extremely strong sense of hunger seemed to have chased away my fear. I dragged myself back home and ate up almost everything in my fridge, finally regaining some strength. During which, I tried using the metal cutlery and the camera to see my reflection, but everything failed without exception.

After that, I tried my best and barely calmed down. After multiple tests, I’ve realized that I’m non-existence to everyone, and I can’t touch anyone either. However, I can influence some objects that are not in contact with any form of life.

Therefore, I tried driving, stealing, creating accidents, and so on. Most of my actions that will have a direct influence on others will be interrupted by me suddenly passing out. However, many of my attempts at stealing worked, and no one noticed. It’s only thanks to that was I able to live till now, or I would’ve starved to death long ago.

The illusion that causes me to faint happens frequently. I’ve realized that I seem to be able to see a certain period of time into the future, but I can’t activate or deactivate that power. When this power activates, I faint and feel weak after. I’m guessing that the cost of using this power is my stamina.

I thought of the Mutation Disaster. My body has definitely gone through some kind of terrifying mutation. I’ve lived for about three months in this state. Initially, I was terrified, but then, for some time, I felt happy, and after that, I felt lost and alone. I can’t interact with people in real life, so I tried communicating with people online.

However, no matter what method I use to leave a message, it all still seems to get ignored by others. I’ve sent messages to my friends, but I never get a reply. No one from my company has even called to ask why I haven’t been going to work. It’s like everyone has lived with the fact that I’ve just simply evaporated. I don’t understand why. Therefore, I’ve written this diary, hoping that someone sees it and comes to help me. My address is Maple County, Ice Forest City, No. 107 Morning Light Street, Block B 1511. I’ll be waiting at home for you.

One day later, on Floating Dragon Island...

“No such person has been found?”

Han Xiao received the search report from Phillip and the various army members, frowning “Master, hum... Not only are there no traces of this person in the surveillance footage, I even crossed referenced the photo with all ID photos of the residents registered in the Aquamarine Federation. Still, no match found.” “We’ve scanned the entire planet using all kinds of vital sign detection devices, including every spot, and we could not find the target either,” the army warrior who was in charge of the field search said. “Is this person really on Planet Aquamarine?”

Han Xiao tapped on the table, turned to Harrison, and asked, “What do you think?” “Me?” Harrison pointed at himself with surprise and said with some hesitance, “How about we make a search notice?”

“Alright.” Han Xiao nodded. Initially, he did not know anything about this person in Aesop’s prophecy, so he did not want to alert him. However, since they could not find him now, making it public would not hurt. Anyway, he was right there, so he was not worried about anyone causing any problems.

He had to see what connection he had with this stranger.
