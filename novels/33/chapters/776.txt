Chapter 777 Sudden

The energy Han Xiao was giving off had become much stronger. The power of the mechanical army had increased instantly. Not expecting this, Heber had been blown away by the countless particle cannon attacks.

Heber’s continuously growing momentum was broken, which shocked countless spectators.

“Black Star hid such power...” The look in Psyker’s eyes slightly changed.

The energy that Han Xiao was giving off surprised him. He was certain that Black Star had not been this strong when he fought him more than a month ago.

Is this his trump card?

Ames could not help but glance at Han Xiao. A tint of shock flashed through her eyes.

Seeing their own boss penetrating their formation, Jorde’s expression changed for the worse. The excitement of the Bloodshed Land officers was instantly extinguished.

Although Heber had merely taken a small hit, the Bloodshed Land officers had initially thought that the Tyrant would have the complete upper hand as the opponent was just a new Beyond Grade A Super. The current turn of events shocked them.

The mechanical army chased after Heber. By this time, Heber had already stabilized himself. His face was grave. Having been taken by surprise, he was a little angry.

His fist charged forward, shooting a thick Pugilist impact wave toward the mechanical army.

The mechanical soldiers responsible for defenses moved from the back to the front, forming an enormous psionic protective shield in front of the army.

The Star Shaking Fist crashed onto the shield. The blinding red and gold light quickly expanded, exploding like a supernova, filling everyone’s vision with white light.

As the mechanical army was stopped by the Star Shaking Fist, Heber took the opportunity and dashed out. He made a turn and pulled the battlefield away from the Bloodshed Land’s forces. Han Xiao followed right behind and chased him with his mechanical army.

With the enhancements of Perfect Mechanical Sense, the mechanical army was tremendously stronger be it in terms of offense of defense. The millions of mechanical soldiers surrounded a single person, the light of psionic energy flashing nonstop within the battlefield.

Suddenly, Heber slowed down. He endured the focus fire and explosions with his body and launched another [Energy Lock] Shockwave Blast toward Han Xiao.

However, this time, Han Xiao had experience. He quickly escaped from it with his Chaos Body and Void Hyperdrive. Heber was astounded—he had thought that Han Xiao’s Void Hyperdrive was still in cooldown.

“The same ability won’t work again on me.”

Having realized that he had judged it wrong, Heber frowned. Now that this ability no longer worked on Han Xiao, he had no choice but to patiently deal with the mechanical army while thinking of another way.

With every punch, kick, and Shockwave Blast, tons of mechanical soldiers were heavily damaged or even instantly destroyed.

Heber, however, was not unharmed. Wounds gradually started to appear on his mountain-sized body.

With his energy increasing his cell vitality, the old wounds kept recovering, but new wounds kept appearing as well. The mechanical soldiers that he had destroyed were repaired time after time by Han Xiao’s [Waste Modification] and [Advanced Machinery Construction].

Feeling the flowing Mechanical Force in his body, Han Xiao was thrilled. Perfect Mechanical Sense is really a god-like ability...

The 1.4 times total Machinery Affinity multiplier was a powerful Molding Talent. The damage the mechanical army dealt to Heber was clearly on another level. More than half of the raw strength difference between him and the Tyrant was mitigated by Perfect Mechanical Sense.

Sadly, this Molding Talent came from Reynold’s Character Summon Card and was not yet his own. He only had three chances to use it; this was the second.

After fighting for quite some time, Heber’s expression gradually became graver.

Initially, he had thought that no matter how talented the new Beyond Grade A was, his combat capability would not be too high. Yet, Han Xiao’s current combat capability had shattered this thought directly.

The situation suddenly became even. Heber’s plan to quickly end the battle was instantly broken, and he was forced into destroying machinery with his bare hands in a long battle.

Long battles were the strength of Army Style Mechanics. Heber knew full well that the combat had fallen into Black Star’s control. If this carried on, it would be bad for him.

What he wanted was to make an example out of Black Star, but if the battle became even, it would be the other way around.

Not only would he fail to build more reputation, he would even lose it and become a stepping stone for Black Star’s name. Black Star was a new Beyond Grade A who lacked fundamentals. Being able to fight him, a known senior Beyond Grade A, evenly would definitely be beneficial for Black Star.

Furthermore, he was the one that had demanded this battle. If he turned out to be unable to defeat Black Star, he would definitely be extremely ashamed.

Close combat was the strength of Pugilists. Although Heber also knew ranged abilities such as the Star Shaking Fist, a Beyond Grade A Mechanic like Black Star had way too many ways to block ranged attacks. In order to heavily damage Black Star, the only chance was to get close to him.

Heber’s close-range damage output was horrifying. Among all the Beyond Grade As in Galaxy, no one would remain unharmed after a close-range explosive combo of a Beyond Grade A Pugilist, not even Heber himself.

He did indeed have one ability that could instantly get close to Black Star. However, he could only use it every once in a very long time. Black Star had many dodging and fleeing abilities, so he would be able to easily get away from him again if he failed. Heber was rather troubled.

Slippery guy. Heber frowned. The window of opportunity to get close to Black Star would only last for an instant; he had to wait for a chance.

...

Heber fought intensely with the mechanical army. The explosions lightened up the sights of all the audience. Almost all the spaceship radars of the spectators were repeating alarms continuously.

“High energy reaction detected! Please get away immediately! High energy...”

If the battlefield was a planet, it would have been destroyed long ago.

“It seems even...”

“I can’t believe it. Black Star is matching up to the Tyrant.”

“The Tyrant seems to have the lower hand now.”

Countless spectators were stunned. Their impression of Black Star was continuously refreshed.

Seeing that Han Xiao stood his ground, the Black Star Army players were thrilled.

“Black Star gained control of the battle using the kiting strategy. The Tyrant’s only way of breaking this is to get close. However, he seems to be unable to get across the mechanical army.” Inside the battleship of the army, Hao Tian analyzed the battle. As a pro player, despite his level not being high, his PVP senses were still very sharp.

“Pugilists are good at explosive power at close range,” Frenzied Sword said. “As long as the captain maintains this kiting, he will not be defeated... given that the mechanical army can last that long.”

“That’s what I thought.” Bun-Hit-Dog nodded.

However, at this time, a sudden change occurred in the battlefield. Hao Tian, Frenzied Sword, and the others’ expressions changed drastically.

“Not good!”

...

The focus fire of the mechanical army created blinding explosions and obstructed the audience’s vision.

At this time, surrounded by the mechanical army, Heber suddenly disappeared.

The next instant, he appeared behind Han Xiao immediately.

As expected. Han Xiao’s eyes sparkled. He had expected this. He had known that Heber would have a teleportation type Pugilist ability, so he had prepared for it long ago. However, he had to admit that Heber had picked a great opportunity.

Just as Han Xiao was about to dodge with Void Hyperdrive, all the abilities on his interface became gray.

Han Xiao’s pupils constricted. He had no way to break free from a forced silence type ability. Heber had waited so long to use this and surprised him.

This interrupted his Void Hyperdrive and held him in his place.

With a cold expression, Heber punched right through the psionic shield and onto the Battle Tiger mechanical suit. An impact wave flew into Han Xiao’s body.

This is bad.

He had been avoiding getting comboed by Heber all along, but Heber’s attacks were not easy to deal with. Now he was on the passive side.

The next second, red and gold fists landed on his body like a thunderstorm. The punches created countless afterimages and pits on the mechanical suit.

Dong! Dong!

Heber’s every attack was a different Pugilist ability. As soon as he successfully landed the first disabling ability, he would be able to use continuous disabling abilities. Due to his vastly superior Strength and Dexterity, the Judgements for those abilities would usually all succeed.

The terrifying combo damage caused the armor of Battle Tiger and Han Xiao’s own health to plummet.

With cold murderous intent in his eyes, Heber went all out without hesitation—he planned to heavily injure or even immediately kill Han Xiao in one combo!

...

The developments of the battle made the expression of countless people change drastically.

“Black Star is in danger...” Austin murmured.

Being controlled by Heber at close range was more than enough to threaten the life of a Beyond Grade A.

Ames could not help but look over.

“Chance!”

At this instant, Psyker moved. He rushed right into the battlefield, straight toward Han Xiao at an extremely high speed.

Distracted, Ames was a second slower to respond. Anger appeared in her eyes.

Just as she was about to drag Psyker back with her force field, the fleet of the Arcane Church suddenly fired. Highly condensed annihilation beams headed toward Ames.

Ames did not expect the fleet to suddenly attack. She hastily turned around and stopped the attacks of the fleet with her force field.

In just an instant, Psyker approached Han Xiao and Heber.

Black Star is being pinned down by the Tyrant. This is the opportunity to grab the Evolution Cube!

The sudden change of situation shocked everyone. In their eyes, it was clear that the Arcane Church had broken the rules, restraining Ames with their fleet while Psyker suddenly attacked Black Star together with Heber!

It was as if Black Star had fallen into a desperate situation in an instant!

“Teacher!”

“Black Star!”

“Captain!”

The expressions of Sylvia, Herlous, and the army officers all changed drastically!
