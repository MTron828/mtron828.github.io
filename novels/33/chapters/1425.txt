Chapter 1426 Negotiation And Lobbyist

Han Xiao’s remote projection landed in the conference room. He looked around and saw the expressions of all the Super Star Cluster Civilizations’ leaders. He could not help but smile and joke.

“Everyone, what were you talking about? The atmosphere is so tense.”

“We’re talking about how to deal with the World Tree’s invasion,” the Star Arc Leader said.

“Is that so? But from what I know, the World Tree Civilization’s army did not harass your territory much. Most of your troops are still on standby.” Han Xiao shrugged.

“The entire galactic society is united against a common enemy. If the other regions are attacked, it also affects our safety. As long as our homeland is safe, we will naturally help,” the Star Arc Leader said.

Han Xiao’s expression changed. “It’s really strange of you to say that.”

“The World Tree has invaded. We are already in the same boat,” The Star Arc Leader nodded and said with a solemn tone. “If that’s what you think, that would be best.”

Han Xiao raised his brows. He knew that the words the Star Arc Leader was saying were mostly empty and not sincere. A leader of the Super Star Cluster coughed and

said,

“Your Excellency Black Star, are you looking for us to discuss the World Tree invasion?”

Han Xiao looked at him and nodded. “You can say that, but I am here mainly for you guys.”

Everyone exchanged looks. The Star Arc Leader said, “I hope you can explain it clearly.”

Han Xiao raised his arms and said casually, “The World Tree invasion is already a fact. How much do you know about the cause of this?”

“We don’t know the inside story. The World Tree was originally separated from the Flickering World by the three Universal Civilizations, and the situation was very stable. However, the enemy suddenly launched a full-scale invasion. They must have used some method to obtain our intelligence, but we don’t understand how they did it.” The Star Arc leader frowned and shook his head.

“I can tell you the inside story. This is not the World Tree taking an initiative. Someone deliberately leaked the information about the explored universe, daringly colluding with the enemy. This kind of action is like opening the border, inviting the World Tree in to burn, kill, and loot!” Han Xiao’s tone was heavy.

As soon as he said that, the expressions of the Super Star Cluster upper echelons changed. Surprise, shock, disbelief, and other emotions appeared in their eyes.

The Star Arc leader’s eyes were filled with shock. He emphasized, “You mean there’s a traitor in the galactic society ?”

“That’s right.” Han Xiao nodded slowly and said softly, “We’re still investigating the identity of the traitor.”

There was a slight commotion in the room. Everyone was whispering and discussing.

The Star Arc Civilization was also confused.

“To be able to pass the intelligence to the World Tree, they must have quite good technical strength. They chose to betray us in such a dangerous situation. What are they after...”

However, halfway through his sentence, he suddenly paused and looked up at the expressionless Han Xiao.

The upper echelons also snapped back to reality. They had all realized Han Xiao’s true intentions, and their expressions changed.

Wait a minute, Black Star came to our door at this time and purposely brought up this topic. Does he think we’re the traitors who leaked the information ?

Of course, the Super Star Cluster Alliance had always been at odds with the three Universal Civilizations and was the biggest suspect, but this matter had nothing to do with them!

“Are you suspecting us !” The Star Arc Leader’s eyes widened.

Han Xiao looked around and did not reply directly. Instead, he summoned a virtual screen and said,

“According to the information I’ve found, you guys set up a plan called ‘Great Relocation Plan’ more than ten years ago. The specific content is probably to take all the people and resources and leave the explored universe while the war is still ongoing to find another territory. This plan needs an opportunity, and only when the three Universal Civilizations are at a stalemate with the World Tree will you have a chance...”

The upper echelons of the Super Star Cluster became even more solemn.

They had thought that this plan was rather secretive. Gathering the people and resources was for the sake of war in name only. On the surface, it seemed like they had a reasonable motive. At most, the others would think that they were leaving a way out if the war failed, and they would not think that they were planning to run away.

“You already know... It’s no wonder. With your ability, as long as you’re suspicious of us, it won’t be difficult for you to find these things.” The Star Arc Leader was shocked, but when he thought of Han Xiao’s ability, he accepted reality and said helplessly, “So, you think that we deliberately lured the World Tree into an all-out invasion to mess up the situation and make it easier to retreat?”

“What do you think?” Han Xiao tilted his head.

Hearing this, everyone knew that Han Xiao was probably here to condemn them. The Star Arc Leader gritted his teeth and said, “I know you think we have a motive, but we did not do this. We are not traitors!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Although they wanted to escape, they did not want to become traitors. Otherwise, if they were targeted by the three Universal Civilizations, there would definitely be many twists and turns in the ‘Great Relocation Plan’. The three Universal Civilizations would not allow a ‘traitor’ like them to escape easily.

“What evidence do you have to prove that you didn’t do it?” Han Xiao said emotionlessly.

Hearing this, the Star Arc Leader’s thoughts raced, but his mind was in a mess. He could not think of any reason to prove that this matter had nothing to do with them. How much evidence did he need?!

However, before he could reply, Han Xiao continued.

“Maybe this wasn’t your idea, but can you guarantee that this wasn’t done by one of the civilizations present here?”

The Star Arc leader was stunned, and his expression changed. He knew that Han Xiao was right. He could only guarantee that he was not a traitor, but he could not guarantee that the other Super Star Cluster civilizations would not do anything in private.

He slowly turned his head and looked at the other members of the alliance with a questioning look in his eyes. Everyone understood what he meant and spoke.

“It’s not me, I didn’t do it!”

“It’s not me either. I don’t know anything about this!”

Very soon, the Star Arc Leader looked at the last person. He remembered that during the meeting some time ago, it was this leader of the Super Star Cluster who suggested helping the World Tree.

The leader of this civilization was furious. “What are you looking at me for ? I didn’t do it! We’re all in this together, I won’t ignore the collective interests of the alliance!”

The Star Arc Leader gritted his teeth and looked at Han Xiao. “As you can see, this has nothing to do with us...”

Han Xiao did not say anything. He only tilted his head and looked at the Star Arc Leader with a strange gaze as if saying ‘are you joking with me?’

Seeing this, the Star Arc Leader fell silent.

He also knew that no one would admit it if he asked this question. It was ridiculous for everyone to deny it together. It was not convincing at all. No one knew if the members of the alliance were lying.

However, the Star Arc Leader knew very well that no matter if it was done by a member of the Super Star Cluster, they definitely could not admit it. Otherwise, they would become ‘traitors’.

Han Xiao narrowed his eyes and said in a more serious tone, “Don’t say I didn’t warn you. I’ll give you one more chance. Are you sure you didn’t do it?”

“Black Star, we can’t produce any evidence at the moment, but we really didn’t do it,” the Star Arc Leader said anxiously.

“Alright, I trust you guys.”

“I hope you won’t jump to conclusions. If you keep watching us, the real traitor will escape. I...” The Star Arc leader subconsciously trailed off before suddenly raising his voice.” Wait, you believe us ?”

He had just racked his brains to convince Han Xiao, but he did not expect Han Xiao to change his mind before he could even use his justifications.

However, at this moment, Han Xiao spoke again. “However, it’s useless for me to believe you. The three Universal Civilizations have to believe you. You have to find a way to prove your innocence.”

“You mean...”

“It is natural for you to stay and fight hard.” Han Xiao spread out his hands and said, “Think about it, the three Universal Civilizations are suspecting a traitor. The moment you leave, you’ll confirm your identity as a traitor. The only way is to give up on your so-called relocation plan and focus on fighting the World Tree. Only then can you clear the suspicion.”

Hearing this, the eyes of many Super Star Cluster Civilizations’ leaders narrowed.

The Star Arc Leader frowned and no longer panicked. He slowly said, “Your Excellency Black Star, I’m afraid this is your true purpose for coming, isn’t it?”

He was not an idiot, and he immediately realized Han Xiao’s true goal.

There were priorities in everything. The Super Star Cluster Alliance did not want to become traitors, but the relocation plan was more important. They would not give up the migration just to prove that they were not traitors.

The Star Arc Leader even suspected that the so-called traitor was just an excuse that Han Xiao came up with after discovering their relocation plan.

Han Xiao did not think much of it. He smiled and said casually, “Hehe, I know what you guys are thinking. Traitors really exist, and the three Universal Civilizations suspecting you guys is also true. However, I never thought that you guys were traitors.” “Why do you think so?” The Star Arc Leader was curious.

“We’ve known each other for decades. I know the style of your decision-makers quite well. In fact, given your situation, the possibility of you daring to collude with the enemy is quite low. However, because of your past history, you’re the most suspicious. This is very similar to framing someone. My intuition tells me that this has little to do with you... Of course, this doesn’t mean that you’re not suspicious. I can’t confirm if you’re doing the opposite.”

Han Xiao did not plan to eliminate all the pressure on the Super Star Cluster, so he did not reveal (Bold Explorer] to them.

Han Xiao knew that the Super Star Cluster Alliance would not give up on the relocation plan so easily. He planned to have this talk to use the suspicion of traitors as an excuse at the start. He only wanted to make the Super Star Cluster Alliance nervous and understand the situation.

“It seems like even though your big picture has been destroyed, you still have your rationality.” The Star Arc leader had mixed feelings. He nodded and said, “I really don’t know about the traitor, but we can’t give up on the relocation plan and stay behind to fight. Since you’ve found the information, you should know how important this plan is to

us.”

Han Xiao nodded and said, “The existence of the three Universal Civilizations has limited your development. For many years, they have been using all kinds of excuses to suppress you and prevent you from entering the era of technological explosion. The top talents and resources of the galactic society have all flowed to them, and as this continued to accumulate, the gap between the two of you became larger and larger...” “That’s right! Thinking back, when the exploration era war had just ended, the three Universal Civilizations set the order. They did not have the strength to dominate all the civilizations back then, but now? So many years have passed, and they are enjoying the best resources and the biggest development dividend in the entire galactic society. There is already a generational difference in our technologies... Now, we still have some ability to resist, but the longer we wait, the bigger the gap. Sooner or later, we will completely lose the qualifications to challenge the three Universal Civilizations, and we will only become servants.”

A Super Star Cluster leader said with a helpless tone.

The Star Arc Leader nodded and added, “It is precisely because we can see the distant future, that we have to constantly search for opportunities to change our fate while we can still resist. The Flickering World was an attempt, but it failed. The migration now is a better opportunity, and we will not give up.” “I understand your appeal, truly I do... but with all due respect, what you’re doing is just a slow death. What you’re thinking of being mutually tied down is only superficial, thinking that you’ll be safe once you leave the war zone. You have nowhere to run. After the World Tree destroys the three Universal Civilizations, they will definitely find you. They have extraordinary abilities in the Information Form aspect...”

Han Xiao explained the Information Form ability of the World Tree in detail, ensuring that everyone present knew the true situation. He then paused and continued,

“Therefore, your only way out is to stay and destroy the World Tree Civilization with us... This is a very simple choice. This way, your development might not be free, but at least your civilization can survive.”

The leaders of the Super Star Cluster looked at each other and discussed softly. The Star Arc leader pondered for a while before slowly saying, “For us to send our troops into the battlefield, you have put in a lot of effort. You even personally acted as a lobbyist... Let’s assume what you said is the truth, but I have a concern that needs your answer.”

“Speak.”

“Will the three Universal Civilizations let us go so easily?” The Star Arc leader leaned forward and asked, “Let me make myself clear. If we defeat the World Tree and win back peace, how can you guarantee that the three Universal Civilizations won’t settle the score afterward? How can you guarantee that they won’t give us the identity of ‘traitors’ and attack us rightfully?”.

Everyone stared at Han Xiao with a forceful gaze. This was not the first time the three Universal Civilizations had used ‘groundless’ tactics on them. Therefore, the Super Star Cluster Alliance did not have any hope of getting rid of the suspicion. Whether or not they were ‘traitors’ would still depend on what the three Universal Civilizations said. If they were to be labeled as ‘colluding with the enemy’ after this, they would not be able to turn the tables and might even face a disaster.

“Regarding that...” Han Xiao stroked his chin and said calmly,” If we win this war and you guys don’t leave, I can stand on your side and prevent the three Universal Civilizations from using this method. I will also try my best to help you break the development restrictions of the three Universal Civilizations so that you guys don’t have to abandon your homeland to have a chance to develop freely.”.

“You?” The Star Arc Leader narrowed his eyes. “You might have such an organization, but why are you doing this?”.

“Don’t forget, war is a huge reshuffle. The structure of the three Universal Civilizations will definitely be overturned after the war. It’s rare for the three Universal Civilizations to weaken, and they will lose their firm control. This is the best time to change things... Also, helping you guys is also helping myself. Without the invasion of foreign enemies, we will all be the eyesores of the three Universal Civilizations. We have a lot of room for cooperation.” Han Xiao said slowly.

The Star Arc Leader did not budge.

“Sounds good, but how can you guarantee that you won’t go back on your word like before? You have to know that your reputation isn’t too good.”

“I don’t need to promise anyone,” Han Xiao said casually. “I’m just telling you which path is of death and which path is of life. I helped you analyze the pros and cons and gave you a better choice, but I can’t make decisions for you.”

“What if we don’t accept your suggestion?” The Star Arc Leader said with a solemn tone.

“If you insist, I will express my regret. Without the armed forces of the Super Star Cluster, our pressure will be greater, and our losses will be more exaggerated. However, our chances of winning are still very high.”

Han Xiao stroked his chin, paused, and said softly, “As for you guys... do I need to explain what will happen to deserters? With me around, we will be able to find you no matter how far you run. Don’t blame me when the time comes. I’ve given you guys a chance.”

Everyone’s expression changed as they heard the blatant threat.

“Black Star!” one of the Modo Civilization’s leaders shouted. “We know that you’re very powerful. Perhaps no one is your match in individual strength level, but do you really think that you’re invincible after entering the Transcendent Grade? Do you think you can influence the decisions of so many civilizations ?”

However, Han Xiao shook his head and said calmly, “No, there’s no such thing as true invincibility in the world. The so-called invincibility is only invincible in the current technological level environment, and the development of the world is dynamic. As the times change and the civilizations progress, more new technologies will appear. Maybe one day, all the principles of the Space Wonders will be discovered, and the Transcendents will no longer be unbeatable. Maybe it would even be possible to mass-produce Beyond Grade As and Transcendents. Any individual achievements that feel unbelievable now will eventually be duplicated by the collective civilizations, resulting in fission.”

Everyone was stunned. They had thought that Han Xiao would refute, but they did not expect him to agree. They did not know how to respond. They thought that Han Xiao was trying to ease the atmosphere and take back his threat.

However, the next moment, they knew they were wrong.

Han Xiao looked at everyone and said coldly,

“However, those things will only happen in the future. At least in the foreseeable future, I am an unbeatable existence! You can see my words as a threat, or as an ultimatum. Anyway, do your best and don’t make a choice that disappoints me. Otherwise, I don’t mind destroying all the civilizations here. At that time, you will know that I’m more dangerous than the World Tree!”

Everyone in the room fell silent.

After a while, the Star Arc Leader seemed to have made a decision.

“If the situation is as you say, we can temporarily put aside the relocation plan and send more troops to participate in the war. However, if the losses are too great, we will definitely evacuate. No matter how much you threaten us, it will be useless.”

Han Xiao’s expression returned to normal, and he nodded.

“That’s enough. You will know in the future that this is a wise choice.”
