Chapter 444: Chen Xing and Statue Mission (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

This celebrity had a huge number of fans in various Star Clusters in the Shattered Star Ring. He was a singer, and because of how developed the transmission technology was, his influence was not limited by physical distance.

This performance was for the traditional yearly celebration of the New Phylen Alliance being reunited, and this singer was the most famous one among all the invited guests.

The venue of the performance was a vacation spaceship called ‘Wine and Celebration’. Those who could watch it live were all either wealthy or had a very high position in the New Phylen Alliance. If Han Xiao wanted to come into contact with the target, it had to be at the venue, but the problem was... how were they going to get the ticket for the show?

“Are you going to the Union Day Celebration?”

When Sylvia heard about the destination of their spaceship, she rolled her eyes and said, “Stop dreaming. Every year, those that can enter the venue to watch it live are all very important people. Such as leaders of political parties, higher-ups in the army, high level government officials, businessmen that pay tons of taxes every year, and so on. With so many important people gathered in one place, the security is extremely tight. Don’t even think about sneaking in—you might be mistaken for an assassin.”

Han Xiao glanced at her and said, “Have you finished memorizing the books I gave you?”

Sylvia’s tone instantly turned soft, and she murmured, “Isn’t there one more day before the test...”

“By the way, you’re a New Phylen citizen. Don’t you want to watch it live at the scene?”

Sylvia curled her lips and said with a yearning tone, “Who doesn’t want to? But us ordinary people can only watch on television.”

The Union Day was a memorial for the day that the nations of the New Phylen Alliance reunited after their split; it was very meaningful to the New Phylen people, similar to National Day in China. Sylvia wanted to go every year, and in fact, Langley’s position had been high enough to get her into the venue. Unfortunately, he was a traitor and a spy.

Now that she had become a mercenary, she would never have the chance to attend it again, so she could only bury this tiny dream of hers.

Mercenaries were powerful and strong indeed, but they did not have a high position in society. After all, for the most part, the lives of galactic citizens were peaceful. Only when they faced problems that could only be solved with violence would they think of the professionals in this field. Other than that, they would not want to have any contact with such dangerous mercenaries.

Furthermore, most mercenaries were free citizens of the universe that did not have a nationality. Although Han Xiao had worked with the New Phylen Alliance before, this small of relationship was only enough for him to request to see prisoners at most—it was far from enough to attend such a huge celebration.

Of course, nothing was absolute. With the backing of Floating Dragon Island, if Han Xiao could drag Ames there, he did not believe that the New Phylen Alliance would not invite the Dragon Emperor in. In fact, not only would they be invited, they would definitely be sitting in the top VIP seats beside the alliance leader.

What? You don’t give me, the Dragon Emperor, face? ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Well then, have you ever seen a brick the size of a planet?

When one’s strength reached a certain level, there would be no need to even showcase it; just showing up would be enough.

Han Xiao rubbed his chin, pondered, and said, “Since you want to go to the venue, I’ll bring you along then. It’s not much trouble anyway.”

Sylvia was dazed. She asked uncertainly, “Do you really have the ticket? Impossible...”

“There’s no need for a ticket.” Han Xiao waved his hands and said, “Someone will invite me in.”

“As if I believe you.”

Sylvia was obviously doubtful. She paused and said unhappily, “Plus, I still need to memorize the books...”

“Alright fine, I’ll give you a day’s holiday.”

Han Xiao shook his head and smiled.

Herlous came closer and said with an expressionless face, “Let me guess, I’ll be staying here and looking after the ship?”

“Wow, my brother, we really have good chemistry; you basically read my mind.”

Han Xiao clapped with exaggeration, and Herlous resigned to his fate.

...

Wine and Celebration was docked on the main planet of the New Phylen Alliance. This was an enormous spaceship that had a flat hexagonal shape and surrounded by countess guard ships. For the Union Day Celebration, the dock had stopped its service for the day and was used solely to welcome all the attendees.

In the hall of the dock, a huge number of people were gathered. They were all New Phylen citizens, there to watch the boarding ceremony.

All the performers and political leaders would enter from the same path on the dock. This was a ceremony representing the start of the Union Day Celebration and the only chance that normal citizens had to be close to the venue. Hence, there were a lot of people and it was very crowded.

Han Xiao was in the crowd at this moment. Despite the wave of the crowd moving around him, he stood in his place without budging. Sylvia had to hold on to his shirt tightly so that she would not be pushed away.

At the edge of the crowd were rows of soldiers regulating the order and preventing anyone from rushing into the boarding path. These soldiers frequently glanced at Han Xiao with warning and alertness in their eyes—it was clear that they could tell Han Xiao was a Super with a high threat.

“Bla—Black Star... I want to ask you for the last time...” Sylvia said while shivering. She kept swallowing her saliva and spoke anxiously. “We’re not really going to cause a commotion and rush into the spaceship, are we? Although I gave you my next ten years, you don’t have to let cut it this short...”

Han Xiao could not be bothered to reply. He waited patiently and silently.

After some time, a commotion erupted among the crowd in a distance. Accompanied by the guards, the important personnel boarded the ship one after another. The crowd was cheering so loud that it was almost deafening. Those people walked with smiles on their faces while waving and greeting the crowd.

“They’ve started boarding the ship...” Sylvia craned her neck and exclaimed, “Wow, that’s the alliance chancellor. I used to see him a lot on television.”

She did not believe that Han Xiao could enter the venue. Now that the boarding had started, the fact that Han Xiao was still there proved that he was not one of the people that was boarding, but Sylvia did not call him out on it. She was already satisfied that she could go to watch the boarding ceremony. Her father had not allowed her to go in the past, so this was the first time that she had seen the Union Day Celebration spaceship so closely. Although she could not enter the spaceship, she was content.

Although Langley was a rebel, he had taught his daughter to love her country.

Suddenly, a louder cheer came from afar and rippled closer like a wave. Han Xiao looked up. A human-shaped creature in a veil who was surrounded by a group of assistants was walking here slowly. A pair of extremely attractive eyes smeared with black eye shadow could be seen from under the veil. Even the solemn blue robe could not cover his attractiveness.

“Chen Xing! Chen Xing!”

The cheering was thunderous.

Han Xiao nodded in his mind. This was the person that would trigger the mission, a singer with the stage name of ‘Morning Star 1 ‘. From the almost ear-shattering cheer, it was clear how successful this person’s celebrity career was.

By the way, this person was a male.

While passing by where Han Xiao was, Chen Xing suddenly stopped and turned his head slowly. His eyes passed through the crowd and locked accurately onto Han Xiao. The next moment, he directly walked toward this direction.

The crowd instantly became feverish and wanted to touch their idol. The soldiers stopped the wave of people with all their might, and one soldier said, “Your Excellency Chen Xing, please do not come close. It’s not safe here.”

“It’s okay, they will not hurt me.”

Chen Xing opened his mouth. His voice was gentle, soothing, and pure like water. The people who heard it felt calm. The commotion mysteriously stopped, and he walked into the crowd.

The crowd opened up a path willingly.

In the end, Chen Xing stopped before Han Xiao. Under the eyes of countless people, he smiled and said, “Hello, I hope to have the honor to invite you to watch my performance live at the scene personally.”
