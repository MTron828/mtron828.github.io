Chapter 1395 Successor

Just as everyone was having different thoughts, the Supreme Heavenly Venerate shrank, and the mechanical soldiers returned to Han Xiao’s body, revealing his original figure. Han Xiao looked at the location where EsGod had died, and his eyes sparkled. Just when EsGod’s health was emptied with a single slash, a strong intuition suddenly appeared in his head. He thought that his attack might be able to cross dimensions and affect his opponent’s information form, but this feeling was fleeting and could not be captured ‘If I can destroy the enemy’s physical body along with the information form projection, I might be able to eliminate the enemy’s existence. This way, the Sanctum, the World Tree, and the Underworld might not be able to revive them.’

Han Xiao thought to himself.

He suddenly came up with this idea, mainly because of (Information UniquenessConceptual Immortality). If all Transcendents had this ability, then experts of the same level should have the means to counter it. If only a Transcendent could kill a Transcendent, then they should have the ability to use destructive power in information and conceptual levels. “I’ve just stepped into the Transcendent Grade. It seems like there are more abilities hidden at this level that have yet to be completely unlocked.” Han Xiao calmed himself down and flew back to the dynasty’s flagship. As soon as they returned to the command room, everyone turned to look at him with different expressions. Han Xiao ignored them and glanced at Gaud’s expression. “How is it? Are you happy to see your main body after so long?” Gaud remained silent. He was filled with hatred, but he did not dare speak. He was afraid that he would not be able to control the anger that he had accumulated and would confess.

Furthermore, Black Star’s strength had already made him despair.

At this moment, Teny walked over with a complicated look in his eyes. Then, his tone became firm again. “Your Excellency Black Star, you’ve killed him. EsGod will soon become your hired thug. It’s time for you to fulfill your promise.”

What hired thug?

Gaud was slightly stunned. However, no one answered his question at this moment. Han Xiao turned to look at Hila, and Hila understood. She showed the Mark of The Underworld, indicating that EsGod’s soul had been sent into the Underworld.

Seeing this, Han Xiao smiled casually and replied,

“Of course, we each take what we need. This person is now yours.”

Then, he lifted Gaud up and threw him in front of Teny as though he was throwing trash.

Teny could not be bothered with Han Xiao’s attitude. He got someone to help Gaud up. After sensing for a while, he suddenly realized that Gaud’s condition was not right. “Your Excellency Gaud, are you alright?” “I...” Gaud clenched his teeth. Without waiting for him to finish, Hila continued coldly, “His Esper Ability has already been taken away by us. He’s a cripple now.”

“What?”

Teny was shocked, and only after checking carefully did he confirm this point. Furthermore, from his injuries, it seemed like it had happened recently. Black Star had obviously done this, and he could not help but be shocked and furious. “Black Star! How dare you!” “Take a break. Tell Marbruce to come out and talk to me. He should be watching.” Han Xiao ignored him. Teny was stunned. He glared at Han Xiao and gave a few orders. Ten seconds later, a remote projection appeared. It was Marbruce, staring at Han Xiao with a dark expression. “Black Star, this is not the deal we agreed on!” “Is that so? But I remember that the deal was just to hand over the person. Isn’t he in your hands now?” Han Xiao did not mind. “Stop quibbling, you know what I mean!” Marbruce was furious. They had made a deal with Black Star because they wanted to exchange for a direct descent with the Super High-Risk Esper Ability, not a cripple. The current situation made him feel like he had eaten a fly. Energy Control was an ability with a bright future. As long as it was properly nurtured, it would be ranked among the top strengths. However, a Beyond Grade A direct descendant with unparalleled potential had been crippled just like that. Marbruce was so angry that his head was almost smoking.

He was not the only one. All the dynasty officers in the cabin had unfriendly looks on their faces as they glared at Han Xiao and the others. They felt the same hatred because of Gaud’s misfortune, who was a direct descendant of the dynasty. If they did not care about the overall situation, they would have opened fire. “Alright, don’t look so bitter. We’re not done yet.” Han Xiao waved his hand. “Didn’t you guys want an explanation?”

Marbruce suppressed his anger and said with a deep voice, “Speak. You better satisfy us.” “You guys think Gaud is a pure dynasty descendant, but his true identity is EsGod. When he was captured...”

Han Xiao could not be bothered to respond to him. He slowly explained the situation of the split personality caused by [Esper AbilityRebirth). “...So what you’re saying is that you ambushed Gaud and imprisoned him for so many years because he’s an unstable factor that might attract the World Tree in advance? However, EsGod did not know that this doppelganger existed, and only Gaud knew his identity... Don’t you think this is too ridiculous?” Marbruce frowned.

Han Xiao said with a calm expression, “I know you don’t believe me, but I’ve already given him to you. If you have the guts, you can dig out the evidence from him.” It was very difficult for him to use Gaud’s memories as evidence. The dynasty would only think that it was forged. As a direct descendant who had met with a catastrophe, Gaud would not be treated to a memory search just because of a random suspicion from an outsider. The three Universal Civilizations would never use such methods on the direct descendants, which would easily damage their loyalty. Furthermore, the direct descendants would also resist.

However, even if the dynasty was willing to search Gaud’s memories, they would also suspect that he had done something to plant fake evidence. There was no way to completely prove Gaud’s true identity, and Han Xiao did not care if the dynasty believed him or not. As expected, Marbruce did not believe in such a story that could not be verified. He only felt that it was Black Star’s excuse and said with a deep voice, “I’m not satisfied with this explanation. According to you, we still have to thank you?” “Indeed, you should thank me.”

Han Xiao did not mind at all. He could explain it properly, but there was no need to.

Using this matter, he planned to change his previous image. Because he had worked together with the three Universal Civilizations to fight against the foreign enemies, he had built a training base together with them and provided a lot of help, causing his image in the eyes of the three Universal Civilizations to become too righteous. Now that he had stepped into the Transcendent Grade, his details were filled with mystery. He could take this opportunity to create distance between him and the three Universal Civilizations, strengthening his unfathomable image in their eyes, and make them feel that the increase in strength had changed his personality. This was very common. This way, the three Universal Civilizations would be more cautious in dealing with the relationship between the two sides and re-establish their attitude toward him.

It was best not to be too sincere when interacting with these advanced civilizations. The upper echelons of both sides knew that they would be opposing each other sooner or later, so it was pointless to talk about making friends now.

Marbruce’s breathing quickened. After a few seconds, he calmed down and said coldly, “We will investigate this matter internally and find out the truth as soon as possible.” He wanted to turn hostile, but he did not dare. Even if the dynasty did that, the federation and church would not go crazy with them. “Up to you.” Han Xiao waved his hands. “...There’s one more thing. You destroyed Gaud’s Esper Ability, so you have to give me an explanation. Don’t tell me that it’s still an unstable factor.” “That’s it. If he continues to hold this power, there’s a high chance that he will participate in the war. With his special feelings for the World Tree, he might cause something we don’t want to see... I know you guys don’t have the courage to cripple a direct descendant, so I helped you solve this hidden danger. You guys still have to thank me.”

“Black Star!” Marbruce laughed in anger. “Can you be any more shameless ?” “I’m just telling the truth. Whether you accept it or not is your problem.” Han Xiao’s tone was calm.

Marbruce clenched his fists so tightly that his knuckles turned white. After a while, he suppressed his anger and said with a deep voice, “No matter what reason you have, Energy Control is a unique Super High-Risk Esper Ability. It’s too wasteful! If you train it well, this ability will be a powerful method to deal with the World Tree.”

With Black Star’s strength, position, and influence, he could only look at it from a different perspective and blame Han Xiao for being wasteful. He was also very upset about the disappearance of his Super High-Risk Esper Ability. “I agree with you on this.” Han Xiao nodded. “But don’t worry, I did not destroy this ability. It can still be used on the battlefield.”

Marbruce was stunned. He subconsciously looked at Gaud, thinking that Han Xiao was referring to Gaud. However, this time, Han Xiao patted Evans’ shoulder and said, “I’ve already transferred this ability to Evans. Compared to Gaud, his potential is more worth nurturing.” Hearing this, everyone looked over with confusion. “He has the Energy Control Esper Ability?” Teny could not help but ask with a surprised tone. “How did he do that? What kind of ability user is he?” Marbruce had the same doubt as he stared at Han Xiao. “I have been secretly training Evans for decades.” Han Xiao looked at everyone and said, “His ability is the same as EsGod’s. He can absorb the Esper Abilities of others for his own use. It was through this method that he seized Gaud’s Esper Ability gene chain and obtained this Super High-Risk Ability.” As soon as he said that, everyone was shocked. EsGod was the nightmare of many organizations. Thankfully, he had already been killed, but now there was another guy with the same ability in the universe. Could this galactic society still be good ? Marbruce’s pupils constricted as he stared at Han Xiao. Great! Black Star had been trying to groom a second-generation Estod since a few decades ago. Maybe his other goal of killing Gaud was to obtain ‘Energy Control’!

Now that Black Star had an EsGod Hero Spirit and a second-generation EsGod that he had secretly groomed, even Marbruce could not help but be shaken. Han Xiao acted as though he did not see their expressions and said, “How is it? Evans’ potential is better than Gaud’s, right? Don’t worry, I will do my best to train him so that he can be useful on the battlefield. So, Marbruce, you don’t have to worry about this ability being wasted. I’m a very thrifty person.” “...I’m relieved,” Marbruce squeezed out the sound of chewing steel from between his teeth.

“That’s good. Looks like we have a deeper understanding of each other. Since the matter has been resolved, I shall take my leave.”

Han Xiao turned around and left with Hila and Evans. Teny looked at Han Xiao’s back and could not help but whisper, “Black Star, you’ve changed...” Han Xiao paused. ... If I don’t change, should I just wait to be eaten by you guys? He did not say anything and continued walking away. Very soon, his spaceship left the main ship and disappeared from everyone’s sight. Watching Han Xiao and the others leave, the people in the command room remained silent with complicated feelings.

Marbruce was in a gloomy mood. This sudden turn of events made his stomach sour and nauseous.

He wanted to look down on Black Star, but on second thought, he felt a little dispirited. They did not have the right to look down on him. If not for Black Star, the World Tree would have already broken through the national borders. Despite the contradiction, he had no right to judge Black Star’s character. “...Take good care of Gaud. Treat his injuries first.”

Marbruce sighed and deactivated the remote projection. Gaud watched the entire process of Black Star negotiating with the dynasty, and his expression kept changing. Initially, he had a one-in-a-million hope that the dynasty would stand up for him and vent their anger on Black Star. However, the way the dynasty held back in front of Black Star completely shattered his fantasy and his desire for revenge. Not one of the three Universal Civilizations dared to provoke Black Star. Just what position had this guy climbed to in the past few decades? With my current state, touching Black Star’s bad luck again would be like throwing an egg at a rock.

Gaud lamented in his heart. It was as if his bones had been sucked out.

However, he had another question. He turned to Teny and whispered, “You guys just said that Black Star turned EsGod into a hired fighter. What’s going on? Isn’t that EsGod dead?” Teny looked at him with a complicated expression.

Although he did not believe Black Star saying that Gaud was EsGod, he could not help but be wary.

Teny thought for a moment before answering. “You’ve been locked up for decades, so you might not understand. Black Star has subdued a pair of sisters, and the Esper Abilities of these sisters are the same as the two sisters in history. They have also opened up the Underworld Dimension, and they can transform the souls into undying Hero Spirits and make them serve as their subordinates. Although EsGod was killed, his soul was thrown into the Underworld and it became their combat strength. There should be more than ten Beyond Grade A spirits in there now.” Gaud’s eyes widened.

In the Underworld Dimension. EsGod slowly opened his eyes, and a boundless black land appeared before him. “Am I dead...” EsGod looked down and saw that his body had turned into a semi-transparent spirit body. The scene before his death appeared once again. The overwhelming saber light had killed all the life force in his cells in one blow, causing him to tremble from the depths of his soul. He could not help but reminisce. However, it did not take long for him to realize that something was wrong. His soul was only a candle in the wind, but it showed no signs of dissipating. Instead, it was becoming more and more solid.

Swoosh!

At this moment, a few rays of light flashed, and Han Xiao and the others teleported to the surroundings with the King and arrived in front of EsGod.

“What did you do to me?”

EsGod frowned.

“Don’t worry, it’s a good thing for you. Did you think I would really kill you?” Han Xiao chuckled.

“...What are you going to do?” “Don’t worry, this is a good thing for you. This is the Underworld, and it can stabilize souls. It...”

Before Han Xiao could finish, EsGod interrupted him with his eyes wide open. “The legendary Underworld ” “Oh? You know?” Han Xiao paused and raised his brows.

“Of course I know.”

EsGod nodded. As a collector of Super High-Risk Esper Abilities, he had collected information about all the Beyond Grade A Espers in history. As for the two sisters, they were naturally the focus of attention, so he had seen all the records of the Underworld. “That makes things easier. It saved me the trouble of explaining.” Han Xiao smiled. “The life and death Esper Abilities of this generation have owners. They repaired the Underworld and restored its effects. You’re already a soul now. Are you willing to accept the Underworld transformation and become an undying Hero Spirit?” Hesitation flashed through EsGod’s eyes. If he could live, he did not want to die. However, joining the Underworld meant losing his freedom, and he would probably never be able to free himself. Seeing this, Han Xiao smiled and said, “I know what you’re worried about. Actually, this isn’t a bad thing. You should know your own lifespan better than I. You don’t have much longer to live anyway. As long as you give up a portion of your freedom, you can live forever in the Underworld. Furthermore, your physical form has changed, so you don’t have to worry about the genetic chain anymore. You will only be stronger than when you were alive. So, why

not?”

EsGod’s eyes sparkled, and he suddenly said with a deep voice, “Black Star, we’ve known each other for many years. Although you’ve reached a higher level first, my goal has not changed. If I join the Underworld, I won’t have the chance to advance any further.” “You didn’t have a chance in the first place. Even if I didn’t kill you, it’s impossible for you to advance. You don’t have to doubt my judgment. As someone who’s experienced, I know better than you what it takes to advance.”

Han Xiao shook his head.

This was not a lie. EsGod’s genetic chain was too overloaded, and his life form would become even more unstable during his Promotion. Furthermore, with his terrible popularity, no peak Beyond Grade A would be willing to help him with his Promotion. Seeing EsGod remain silent, Han Xiao thought for a while and smiled. “But you don’t have to be discouraged. Your dream can be fulfilled by your successor.”

“Successor?” EsGod was confused. Han Xiao beckoned for Evans to come over. “This guy’s name is Evans. He inherited your ability and can steal other people’s Esper Abilities. Can’t he inherit your will and help you see a higher scenery?” “The same ability as mine ?” EsGod was shocked and looked at Evans carefully. Evans also showed his abilities, proving that Han Xiao was not lying. Seeing this, EsGod was even more shocked. “Are you... my illegitimate son ” Evans’ face darkened, but he did not say anything. Han Xiao smiled and said, “How would I know?”

“Let me think...”

EsGod frowned as he recalled.

When he was wreaking havoc in the galaxy, he had naturally vented his desires on females of different species, but they were all left to fend for themselves after mating. He did not know if he had any offspring. The more EsGod thought about it, the more he felt like he had lost a portion of his memories.

At this time, Han Xiao said, “There’s no need to be so conflicted. The probability of having the same Esper Ability is much rarer than having a child, not to mention an extremely rare ability like yours. With my nurturing, Evans did not take the wrong path. Although he has fewer abilities now, his talent is not inferior to yours. Why don’t you nurture him and let him fulfill your wish?”

EsGod was silent for a while before suddenly laughing and jokingly saying, “To put it bluntly, you just want to trick me into helping you train your combat strength and work for you.”

Han Xiao said without hesitation, “Evans has too little combat experience, so he doesn’t know how to coordinate his various abilities. This is your strength, so I’ll have to trouble you to guide him.” “...I haven’t agreed yet.”

“You have a choice?” Han Xiao raised his brows.

“Heh, that’s what I admire about you the most.”

EsGod laughed for some reason, looked at Evans, nodded, and slowly said, “Life is really unpredictable. This is the first time I’m teaching someone... Alright, I’ll teach you how to use this ability to fight. I only have one request... If one day you can reach a higher level, help me beat Black Star up.”

“Wow, so scary.” Han Xiao clicked his tongue.

Evans looked at Han Xiao, then at EsGod. Seeing both of them staring at him, he finally nodded hesitantly. Seeing this, EsGod opened his arms with a calm expression. “Come, turn me into a Hero Spirit. Let this world see what I look like without any mental load!”
