Chapter 846 External Reinforcements!

Outside the atmosphere of Planet Lighthouse, a gigantic dragon that looked like a flagship flew around the battlefield with the colorful formation covering its body deflecting all the cannon fire and leaving a series of explosions in its trail.

Milizaus flapped his wings, and his gigantic body shot forward. The magical force in his body surged, and he threw out an endless wave of magical spells to create a huge magical storm on the battlefield.

Two small figures were following beside Milizaus; they were Sagman and Ninjia. ‘Child of Light’ Sagman’s body shone with a golden light, and he tried his best to shatter Milizaus’ protective formations. Meanwhile, ‘Divine Spell’ Ninjia shot out his own spells, and the both of them tied Milizaus down.

Because of his huge size, Milizaus’ dodging capability was extremely poor, and he was almost like a living target. However, the strength of his flesh could almost ignore all Mages. His energy was also extremely robust as a result and could strengthen his own spells. Although Sagman and Ninjia could tie him down, the battle between both parties would be a stalemate in the short run.

As the three Beyond Grade A Supers roamed the battlefield, all the battleships in the surroundings were caught up in their battle with plenty of battleships being destroyed.

“Two troublesome fellows...” Milizaus had a grave look in his eyes. Sagman was the strongest among the six, and together with another Beyond Grade A Mage, it was extremely difficult to deal with them.

Although he could face them alone, he would not be able to aid Black Star.

“The objective of these two fellows is to tie me down, but it can also be said that I have tied two of their combatants down. However, Black Star must deal with four people, and even if I attempt to help him, these two will also follow along, so it would be equally dangerous for Black Star... Sigh, it can’t be helped. I can only hope that Beyoni and Black Star will be able to hang in there. I won’t be able to help them...”

Milizaus was helpless. Even though he was extremely powerful and one of the three pillars of the dynasty, the two Beyond Grade A Supers that he was facing should not be underestimated. He had no choice but to focus all his attention on them.

If he did not choose to step into this mess from the beginning, he would not be facing such danger.

His frustration at his own choice, anger toward the enemy, and worry for his current situation filled his head. Milizaus got more enraged the more he thought about it and let out destructive golden dragon breath toward the sky. It collided with the light pulse that Sagman sent out, and a huge fiery explosion occurred.

Ninjia used a spell to transmit his voice to Milizaus. “Ah, our four comrades are dealing with two of your comrades, and Black Star won’t be able to last long. The battle over there will end very quickly, so there’s no point in you fighting back. Why not give up now and join our Arcane Church? This is the only way for you to leave alive. You aren’t a direct subordinate of the dynasty, so there’s no need for you to die for them.”

The only reply he received was a shot of dragon’s breath.

“Humph, I knew that you wouldn’t give in.” Ninjia snorted and conjured a magical shield to block the attack.

“Then, let’s continue according to our plan,” Sagman calmly said. “He thinks that we are only trying to tie him down, and we can create an opportunity to use the Ten Thousand Deity Scepter.”

“Sure!”

At this moment, Milizaus was unaware that he was also one of the Arcane Church’s targets!

...

Han Xiao and Beyoni had also begun fighting the four opposing enemies.

The instant the battle erupted, Han Xiao activated the Reynold Character Summon Card without any hesitation, and his Mechanical Force expanded rapidly.

Perfect Mechanical Sense!

This Character Summon Card could only be used three times, and this was the last time!

The 1.4 times Machinery Affinity immediately increased the strength of his mechanical army to the next level. The densely packed mechanical army around him opened, fire and their firepower engulfed the entire sky.

The four instantly moved. A blue light flashed in Dylan’s eyes, and sea water shot out from his body to form a gigantic water dragon. The water dragon curled around his comrades and formed a barrier. Under his control, the water barrier was greatly pressurized and transformed into a solid shield.

Psyker did not remain idle either and released his psychic force to cover the water barrier and increase its defenses.

Boom!

One wave of fire after another crashed down on the water barrier and psychic shield. The shield was broken many times, but it was quickly repaired by Dylan and Psyker each time. Under their combined strength, Han Xiao’s mechanical army needed to break through the defenses of two Beyond Grade As.

The four enemies would not stand still and receive the attacks, so they began to move at high speed as well.

‘Desolate Beast’ Mercer was a gray beastman over seven meters tall, and his appearance looked like a beast that was standing up straight. He was covered in a thick layer of fur from head to toe and was extremely muscular. He had simple custom-made armor on and was currently covered in green Pugilist flames.

Han Xiao was already covered with his mechanical suit, and he was extremely experienced in dealing with Pugilists after fighting Heber. He kept changing his location and operated his mechanical troops to block the other party while maintaining a gap with Mercer.

Facing four powerful enemies, Beyoni, who was by the side, did not dare remain idle and activated his Esper Ability. His main target was Dylan, and he lit up Dylan’s sea water to form a blazing ocean. The water barrier instantly transformed into a large ball of mist after coming into contact with the sea of flames.

Right at this moment, Han Xiao and Beyoni felt a strange fluctuation in space and turned around to look up. They then saw ‘World Gate’ Taylor holding on to a staff and chanting an incantation. A gigantic magical formation then appeared behind him.

Boom!

Palace doors being pushed open sounded in Han Xiao’s ears, and the formation behind Taylor revealed a crack in the middle and transformed into a gigantic door of light.

Inside the door of light was a pitch-black world with red light dots like fireflies as though they were the eyes of a living creature.

“This is... a summoning formation!” Han Xiao’s eyes narrowed.

Ra!

The next moment, countless blood red creatures let out a roar and charged out from the door of light like a flood of blood!

These creatures looked like mutated bats. They had sharp claws, bone spikes, a long horn on their head, and blood red eyes that glowed in the dark. Their appearance looked no different from the relatives of demons.

The moment these summoned creatures appeared, they immediately charged at the mechanical army, and both parties began fighting in midair.

Flesh collided with metal, with blood and oil being spilled. Chunks of flesh and destroyed spare parts rained down from the sky.

Taylor was also a Mage but specialized in summoning spells. This was how he got the nickname ‘World Gate’.

“A Summoner is extremely disadvantageous to me...” Han Xiao gritted his teeth.

Army Style Mechanics and Summoner Mages were the two gangster classes who made use of a Human Wave Tactic. The difference between the two was that a Mechanic burned money and could construct an army before the battle to appear instantly, but a Summoner could only slowly summon their babies during battle by burning mana.

Currently, Han Xiao’s mechanical army had over ten million soldiers, and it would take a very long time for Taylor to summon the same number of creatures. As such, the first batch of summoned creatures would not be able to deal too much damage to the mechanical army. But if he allowed Taylor to continue casting his spell and summon more creatures, Han Xiao’s Human Wave Tactic would be greatly weakened.

If they were fighting a one-on-one battle, Han Xiao had a dozen different ways to disrupt the other party’s summoning. However, they were currently in a group battle, and he had a numerical disadvantage. Thus, it was many times more difficult to stop Taylor from summoning creatures.

“The Pugilist is taking up a forward position to apply pressure to me while the Psychic and Esper control the battlefield from the side. Thus, the Summoner won’t have to face any pressure at all. This is truly a good combination.”

Han Xiao felt his head ache. The enemy had obviously come prepared.

Beyoni understood this point, and he immediately included the summoned creatures as part of his target.

Whoosh!

His area of effect ability was equally powerful, and waves of summoned creatures were burnt up without any ability to fight back.

“I will deal with him,” Dylan said and controlled the sea water to rush toward Beyoni.

He then stepped on top of the wave and shot toward Beyoni like a cannonball. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Beyoni’s body was covered in flames, and his Pyre Demon Tribe blood began surging. He spat out a mouthful of flames and evaporated a large wave of sea water in an instant, clashing head on with Dylan in midair.

Fire and water. Red and blue. Both parties refused to back down, and a large amount of steam was created by the clash.

A thick fog gushed out, and both their fields of vision were blocked. However, this was not a big deal to a Beyond Grade A Super.

Han Xiao could not afford to be distracted. The other party only needed to use a single person to tie Beyoni down, and Psyker, Mercer, and Taylor surrounded him together.

The casualties of his mechanical army increased rapidly, and if not for the boost from Perfect Mechanical Sense, the damage would only have been greater.

Han Xiao was in an extremely bad state as well and was continuously avoiding magic, psychic, and pugilist attacks, without even a second to catch his breath.

With his current strength, it was a stretch for him to deal with three Beyond Grade A Supers at the same time. Beyond Grade A Supers all had vast combat experience and worked together extremely well. Their combined strength was not simply an additive one. Thus, Han Xiao could only spend ninety percent of his time dodging and was in an extremely passive position.

As the three of them chased after Han Xiao, they also destroyed all his mechanical soldiers. They had read through Han Xiao’s file before and knew of his ‘Undying’ title.

Although they believed that Black Star would definitely lose the title of ‘Undying’ under their joint assault, they would only be able to output damage safely after getting rid of Black Star’s mechanical army. After all, the mechanical army did pose a threat to them. The boost from the Perfect Mechanical Sense and [Legendary Battle Technique] True Damage could severely injure them if they were not careful.

As such, Psyker and the other two gave Han Xiao’s mechanical army special attention.

As his mechanical soldiers were destroyed by the enemy, Han Xiao brought them back with [Waste Modification], and it seemed to be like a back and forth tussle.

“Things will be bad if it continues this way...” Han Xiao muttered to himself bitterly as he avoided the attacks.

Although he was able to repair the mechanical army, there was a limit. In the face of four Beyond Grade A Supers, his mechanical army definitely would not be the one surviving to the end.

If all of his mechanical troops were destroyed, he would be like a toothless tiger and would not be able to fight back regardless of how tanky he was.

...

The defensive troops of Planet Lighthouse had also begun their battle with the Arcane Church’s forces.

Milizaus’ Armed Dragon Guards had long joined the battle, and the gigantic dragons clad in heavy armor clashed together with the battleships of the Arcane Church.

Hila, Hadavy, Feidin, and all the Black Star Guards had joined the battle outside the atmosphere to help the dynasty fight against the Arcane Church fleet.

All the Calamity Grade officers weaved through the battleships and used their various abilities to destroy one battleship after another.

Although they wished to help Han Xiao, they knew that the battle between the six Beyond Grade A was not one that they could intervene in. They would only drag Han Xiao down if they attempted to do so, and the only thing they could do was battle together with the dynasty’s forces.

The Black Star Guards were made up of Calamity Grade elites, and they could display their strength in the battlefield.

Apart from sending out Beyond Grade A experts, the Arcane Church had also sent out a group of Calamity Grade combatants, but the numbers could not be compared to the dynasty.

The Calamity Grades from both parties very quickly found each other, and the killing began.

Hadavy endured the pressure of attacks coming in all directions as he chased after the enemy.

Feidin controlled his psychic force, and his psychic attacks accurately found its mark every time.

In such a large-scale battlefield, an endless supply of souls were present to allow her strength to grow rapidly.

Without holding anything back, the dark red energy of death flooded out like a tsunami.

She then looked up at the battle up in the sky. The six Beyond Grade As were fighting, and the energy waves being sent out were too frightening.

“You’d better not die...”

Hila gritted her teeth and went to search for her next enemy.

...

The battlefield between the six shifted continuously, and the summoned creatures grew larger and larger. On the contrary, the mechanical army dwindled.

Han Xiao and Beyoni became more and more passive.

Han Xiao had also suffered from many attacks, but his recovery rate was powerful, and it would not affect him much.

However, Beyoni was different. He did not have a powerful physique and also did not have any defensive means to deal with Psyker’s psychic attacks. As such, his situation got worse and worse.

“This fellow is not going to make it...” Looking at the injured Beyoni, Han Xiao felt his heart sink.

This teammate was his only aid at this moment, and if his only teammate ended up dying, Han Xiao would have to face four Beyond Grade As alone. If that happened, he would be as good as dead.

Right at that moment, Psyker’s group of four exchanged glances and suddenly intensified their attacks.

Xiu!

A white jade beast statue that was over a hundred meters tall suddenly spat out gray light toward Han Xiao. This was Taylor’s elite summoned creature.

Han Xiao immediately tried to avoid the attack. Information about his void bloodline had already been recorded, and his Void Hyperdrive was being restricted by the enemy.

As a Beyond Grade A Mage, Taylor naturally had many means to control dimensional energy. This was the basic skill of a Summoner. As long as Han Xiao entered the Void Dimension, he would be forced out by the other party not too long later. It would be impossible for him to maintain a Void Dimension Jump for long and thus impossible for him to escape.

In truth, from the moment the Arcane Church’s fleet appeared, it was impossible for Han Xiao to escape with the Void Dimension Jump. Even if he abandoned everyone else to escape alone, the Arcane Church’s hyperdrive speed would not be slower than him. They would catch up to him very quickly, and he would have to face them alone.

Avoiding the gray light, psychic energy and a water dragon immediately assaulted him. Han Xiao had no choice but to activate his psionic energy and block the attack while trying to evade them.

Right at this moment, a figure appeared in front of him almost instantaneously. This figure was Mercer, and a flaming fist crashed down on him.

“Isn’t this the instantaneous movement skill that Heber used before?” Han Xiao was shocked and immediately tried to block the attack.

However, the fist seemed to have passed through Han Xiao’s body like an illusion, which proved that the figure in front of him was an illusion.

“Sh*t!” Han Xiao immediately realized what was going on and turned around to look at Beyoni.

Taylor waved his staff, and Mercer appeared beside Beyoni and unleashed a flurry of punches.

Dong! Dong!

Seeing Beyoni being hit, the three others immediately changed their target and unleashed all their firepower on Beyoni!

If he was hit by this wave of attacks in his current state, Beyoni would probably be dead.

Whoosh!

Han Xiao did not consider anything else and made use of his Void Hyperdrive, which was restricted, appearing in front of Beyoni. This short distance was something that he could still manage.

Han Xiao then pushed Beyoni behind him, and he personally endured the combined attacks of the four Beyond Grade As.

Boom!

His mechanical suit was shattered, and his health fell greatly.

Han Xiao felt his entire body ache, and he was sent flying like a ball.

His mechanical army blocked Psyker’s group of four without any consideration for their losses, which gave him some time to stabilize his body.

Bearing with the intense pain, Han Xiao took a look at his health.

“This wave of damage is too frightening. If not for me enduring the attack, Beyoni would probably be dead...”

Han Xiao laughed bitterly in his heart. He was truly a meat shield this time.

Beyoni then supported Han Xiao from the side and asked, “Are you alright?”

“I am still fine. I won’t die so easily. Don’t forget what my nickname is.”

Han Xiao then took a deep breath and activated the recovery ability of his cells to let his frightening injuries recover.

“Thank you. If not for you, I would have died...” Beyoni said with gratitude, but his voice suddenly turned depressed. “No, we are still dead for sure, and it is only a matter of time.”

“Aren’t you stating the obvious? Everyone will die eventually.” Han Xiao could not help but roll his eyes.

“...” Beyoni was truly speechless. You still have the time to joke at this moment...

After which, Han Xiao shook his head and said resolutely, “However, today is not the day!”

Just when Psyker’s group of four were about to give chase, Taylor said with shock, “Wait a moment. I detect a powerful surge of magical energy approaching us through the secondary dimension. It is extremely powerful!”

Space suddenly began to contort, and a gigantic transportation door appeared.

The dynasty’s anti-wormhole apparatus had already been shut down, and Taylor attempted to use his own spacetime magic to restrict the transportation door but realized that the magical fluctuations had exceeded all the Mages that he had ever seen before!

Taylor was shocked. He actually was not able to stop a transportation door with his strength!

The next moment, a gigantic castle appeared from within the transportation door.

“What is he doing here‽” Psyker’s eyes widened with shock. As a Beyond Grade A of the Shattered Star Ring, he was too familiar with this castle.

It was the Palace of Hidden Spells!

Austin floated at the top of the Palace of Hidden Spells with his Forbidden Sorcerers behind him.

“Ah, I’m not late, right?”
