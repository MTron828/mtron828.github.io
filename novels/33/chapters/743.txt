Chapter 744 EsGod“s Intention The

Why mention EsGod suddenly?

Han Xiao frowned. Back when he was attacked by EsGod’s doppelganger, Harrofal had fought alongside him. After seven years, Harrofal had suddenly brought it up again, so something must have happened.

Without hesitation, Han Xiao sent a message to Harrofal directly to ask him what he meant.

However, after waiting for quite some time, Harrofal still did not reply.

Han Xiao suddenly had a bad feeling. He summoned Phillip and said with a deep voice, “Search keyword ‘Harrofal’ and show me the abnormal results.”

Phillip hummed and quickly completed the search.

“Master, hum... A few days ago, various news channels in the Tyla Civilization reported Harrofal’s death.”

He died a few days ago?

Han Xiao knew that something was wrong.

“Bring it up.”

Phillip played the related reports. After watching them, Han Xiao then figured out what had happened.

Just a few days ago, Harrofal was attacked in the government school of the Tyla Civilization. He was kidnapped in front of the public. Even the three Calamity Grades working in the school could not stop the kidnappers.

One day after the kidnappers left, Harrofal’s body was discovered. The message that Han Xiao had just received was sent by Harrofal before his death.

The news stated that the Tyla Civilization had confirmed one of the kidnappers’ identities through the traces left behind, and a bounty had been issued.

Han Xiao opened the bounty information, and the image showed a pale male.

“Orozen, Blood Race... a wanted criminal from sixty years ago,” Han Xiao murmured.

He did not recognize this man.

However, after linking it with Harrofal’s message, the answer was clear—this Orozen was most likely a subordinate sent by EsGod.

“Why did they attack Harrofal?” Han Xiao frowned.

From what he knew, the only link that they had with EsGod was from the battle that happened seven years ago. Could it be that EsGod was so petty that because his doppelganger was tricked, he sent subordinates for revenge?

He felt that this was the only logical reason.

However, EsGod was maniac, and maniacs were not associated with logic.

Han Xiao had no idea if EsGod knew his current strength. If he had only sent Calamity Grade subordinates, it would basically be feeding him kills. Since even his doppelganger had failed, EsGod would definitely not be expecting his Calamity Grade subordinates to succeed. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

After some thought, Han Xiao’s eyes became firm.

“This means that these people are very likely to be able to summon EsGod’s doppelganger like the DarkStar leader did!” If this was really the case, it would be quite a tough situation.

Back then, he had been able to exile EsGod’s doppelganger because of the terrain advantage and Harrofal’s help, which he did not have now.

“I’m much stronger than before. After completing the Promotion after level 220, my health is almost double that of seven years ago. Plus, I have the Void Star Pursuer talent [Cosmic Environmental Adaptation], which greatly increases my defense. Even if I must face an EsGod doppelganger directly, I won’t be in as much of a disadvantageous position as I was seven years ago... Hmm, if it’s just a doppelganger, EsGod might not be able to threaten my life. Aurora’s potions also give me the equivalent of many lives...”

Han Xiao quickly analyzed the situation. As he realized that the situation was not that horrible, he was slightly relieved.

Fortunately, Version 3.0 had begun, and he had already gained enough experience from it to become stronger once again. If he had been the same as seven years ago, EsGod’s revenge would indeed have been very threatening to him.

After looking at news of Harrofal’s death carefully again, Han Xiao sighed and could only mourn for this old friend of his that had once fought alongside him.

This time, a new mission suddenly popped up on the interface.

You have triggered Grade A Bounty Mission [Harrofal’s Revenge].

Mission Introduction: Harrofal is an important member of the Tyla Civilization. He was murdered, and the killer has caused an extremely horrible impact. The Tyla Civilization has issued a bounty. Anyone that avenges Harrofal will receive a huge amount of reward.

Mission Requirements: Kill or capture the bounty target—Orozen.

Reward: 236,000,000 Experience, 8,000,000 Enas bounty, +1,800 Tyla Civilization Favorability.

To a Version 3.0 player, the difficulty of this mission is way above their abilities. No wonder the rewards are so good... Han Xiao tutted.

No players in Version 3.0 would be able to complete this mission. Missions with this kind of difficulty would only appear in at least two more versions.

However, Bounty Missions were not restricted by versions. Many people were wanted by civilizations or black markets. Even the players now would be able to accept Bounty Missions for Calamity Grades or even Beyond Grade As, just that they would certainly not be able to complete them.

For example, many Shattered Star Ring organizations had secretly issued bounties for Han Xiao on the black market, which totaled about ninety-two million Enas. This was an outrageous bounty for even major galactic pirates. However, most bounty hunters knew the limit of their capabilities, so no one would accept this kind suicide mission.

“The requirement is to avenge Harrofal...” Han Xiao murmured. “There’s no need to waste energy tracking the culprit; that is Tyla Civilization’s job. A Star Cluster civilization has more resources to track the culprit. It would be like searching for a needle in a haystack for me. If EsGod’s subordinates are looking for revenge, they will most likely come for me. I will just have to wait.”

After contemplating for a while, Han Xiao made up his mind. He was not planning to break his tempo of farming talents because of this mission.

If EsGod’s subordinates were not coming, it would save him some trouble, but if they were indeed after him, he did not mind getting rid of the mission target. He was rather confident in this. After all, the outside world did not know that he had made another breakthrough in terms of strength.

According to the combat experience from seven years ago, he would just about be able to endure the pressure from an EsGod doppelganger.

Of course, being confident was one thing. The Great Mechanic Han would not be less alert because of it.

“I still have to be cautious...”

At the same time in a certain area in the Shattered Star Ring, three curved spaceships slowly flew between an asteroid belt in stealth mode. There were signs of a battle on these ships. Nano Robots were repairing their armor.

Inside the main ship, Colin, Orozen, and the rest were looking at the data records of a wormhole detector. This was a device that they had received from Harrofal. Inside was the many years of data of studying the wormholes, among which was the data of the time when an EsGod doppelganger fell into the wormhole.

“Hmm... the dates align. This is the data that His Excellency EsGod wants.” Orozen grinned, showing a few fangs. “The memories I read are indeed correct.”

Orozen’s Esper ability was the rare ‘Race Strengthening’, which enhanced his Racial Talents as a member of the Blood Race. He had the ability to read the memories of the target whose blood he consumed. These people did not kidnap Harrofal to interrogate and torture him but to let Orozen suck his blood and get the intelligence they wanted. Harrofal’s cause of death was his blood being drained dry completely while he was still alive.

“But due to your stupidity, the Tyla Civilization discovered your identity,” Colin said coldly. “The entire Star Cluster civilization is now searching for us. Maybe they will be able to discover that we’re members of the Fallen Ark. If not because you’re still a little useful, I would’ve killed you.”

Orozen did not care at all. He leaned back on the sofa, crossed his legs, and said lazily, “So what? The Tyla Civilization won’t be able to catch up to our spaceships. Plus, this is the Shattered Star Ring, not the Central Galaxy ruled by the three Universal Civilizations.

“Is it necessary to be this careful? Might as well have some fun. So what if an organization in this remote Star Field discovers who we are? Can they go to the Central Galaxy to fight Fallen Ark?

“Plus, even if they really dare to go there, they will only end up being demolished by His Excellency EsGod.”

Colin snorted. “If any accidents happen during the operation, I will make you pay.”

“Instead of worrying about something so unimportant, how about sending the data back first?” Orozen shrugged and snickered.

Colin did not continue hanging onto the fact that their identities had been partially exposed. Through the super-long- range quantum communication device, he sent the wormhole data back to the Fallen Ark.

This way, the first mission given by His Excellency EsGod was complete.

Colin was rather satisfied with their efficiency. After planning for more than half a month, they had successfully kidnapped Harrofal and retrieved the data right away. The mission was going smoothly.

Since they had obtained the data, there was no need for them to find Black Star.

This team had three EsGod doppelgangers in their hands, which were all given different abilities. Colin did not want to waste any of them on Black Star—these were all important trump cards that EsGod had given them to steal the Evolution Cube.

Stealing the Evolution Cube from Psyker was the most important mission of this trip. Comparatively, kidnapping Harrofal was a walk in the park.

Colin clapped his hands and said with a deep voice, “The data has been sent. It’s time to get down to business. Psyker is a Beyond Grade A, so we need a detailed plan and a suitable opening.”

The three spaceships changed direction and headed to the Star System where Psyker resided.

In a desolate universe belt outside the Central Galaxy, the main army of the Fallen Ark was resting in their secret stronghold.

In the main ship, an officer woke EsGod up from his sleep.

“Your Excellency EsGod, the team we sent to the Shattered Star Ring had sent back the data you wanted.”

Upon hearing the officer’s report, EsGod woke up. The black vortex under his hood turned into a face. He then smiled strangely and said with a husky voice, “Good... good. Have the research team analyze this wormhole data and find the place that the other side of the wormhole was connected to at that time. I want to know the coordinates of that place in the universe.”

“Understood.”

“Hmm...let me think. Right, I told them to bring the Evolution Cube back. Have they succeeded?”

“They have yet to send any information related to that. They should still be on the task.”

EsGod slowly nodded and mumbled, “I have finally discovered where the Evolution Cube is. The Arcane Church has been looking for it for so long. They have no idea that the leftover records of the Evolutionary Civilization have always been in my head. I’m the rightful heir of the Evolution Cube. It can help me achieve a higher level of evolution. Psyker has no right to such a treasure...”
