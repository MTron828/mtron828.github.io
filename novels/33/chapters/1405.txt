Chapter 1406 Dylan: I Am a Pro in Pulling Aggro

“What are you doing?”

The Fortitude Tree King, who was wrestling with Herberlon at the back, immediately noticed the abnormality of the Subduing Tree King and was shocked.

What the hell? Are you seriously stopping ? Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Originally, many of the World Tree powerhouses had retreated at the same time and formed a battlefront to support each other, effectively blocking the pursuit of the enemy group. However, the moment the Subduing Tree King stopped, he was instantly at the back and left the team, exposing himself to the enemy Beyond Grade As. “I...”

The Subduing Tree King trembled as though he had just woken up from a dream. He suppressed the urge to turn around and took a deep look at Dylan before hurriedly following the rest.

However, before he could speed up, Dylan raised his brows.

“What are you looking at? What, you want to hit me? Do you have the guts?”

The Subduing Tree King paused, clenched his teeth, and continued to accelerate.

Seeing this, Dylan laughed and said with a judgmental tone, “That’s right. Keep running. A Pugilist who doesn’t even have this bit of courage doesn’t have the right to even look at me.”

The Subduing Tree King subconsciously stopped once again. He was shocked and furious... Usually, he would not be affected by such verbal conflict, but for some reason, when these words came out of this person’s mouth, he could not control his emotions.

Anger surged through his brain, and the Subduing Tree King suppressed it. Just as he was about to take another step forward, Dylan’s sarcastic voice sounded again.

“You really stopped? You can’t even stand two sentences? Ha, you don’t even have this little patience. You’re indeed a Pugilist. Other than ‘stupid’, there’s no other word suitable for you.”

It was as if an invisible hand had grabbed onto his body, and the Subduing Tree King froze. He wanted to continue retreating, but he could not move his legs no matter how hard he tried. A demonic murmur echoed in his heart.

“Kill him... kill him... kill him...”

The Subduing Tree King’s expression changed drastically. His expression was twisted, as though he was fighting with himself.

All of a sudden, the Fortitude Tree King’s roar sounded in his mind.

“Are you f*cking leaving or not ?”

The Fortitude Tree King could not take it anymore. He did not know what had gotten into the Subduing Tree King, but he was running intermittently. It was as if he was suffering from kidney damage, and he was getting left behind.

“There’s something strange about that guy. His words can anger me...” The Subduing Tree King’s tone was gloomy. “Can’t you block his mental transmission ?”

The Fortitude Tree King roared in rage.

He even had to remind him of such a simple matter. He was indeed a pugilist!

The Subduing Tree King was stunned for a moment before coming to a realization.

That’s right, I can still block him. Why didn’t I react just now? I must have lost my mind because of the anger!

He convinced himself. He was not willing to admit that although he was angered to the point of wanting to beat someone up, there seemed to be a magic in Dylan’s words that made him want to listen to the scoldings more...

He quickly solidified the mental barrier and blocked the outside mental fluctuations. At this moment, the Subduing Tree King finally felt that the world was peaceful.

He suppressed the inexplicable reluctance in his heart and continued to run.

“Go back and support the Subduing Tree King!”

The Fortitude Tree King took over the command. He suppressed his anger and ordered the World Tree powerhouses to turn around and receive the Subduing Tree King.

The battlefield was ever-changing. Although the Subduing Tree King had only been delayed for a short while, he had distanced himself from the retreating troops and was completely alone.

Originally, the many World Tree experts had already run far away, and they were able to shake off the Beyond Grade A pursuers of the three Universal Civilizations with a small number of casualties. However, because the Subduing Tree King was being held back by taunts, they had no choice but to turn back and reinforce him. They fell back into the swamp, and their retreat formation was completely messed up.

The Fortitude Tree King had no choice. If he did not send these World Tree experts to support, the lone Subduing Tree King would most likely die on the spot.

Black Star had yet to make a move and could launch a sneak attack at any time. He was afraid that the Subduing Tree King would share the same fate and be sealed like the Heart Tree King, causing another Tree King Crown to disappear. In addition, the Fortitude Tree King did not want the tool, the Subduing Tree King, to die in battle and go into hibernation. That would mean that he would have to take charge of the overall situation, how would he be able to idle away then? He would rather let the other World Tree experts die to save the Subduing Tree King

The World Tree’s retreat was interrupted, and the Beyond Grade As of both sides fought again.

On the other side, Sun Hunter flew past Dylan and laughed.

“Nicely done. Your mind game is quite good. You’ve pinned him down!”

“What mind game? I just want to scold him.”

Dylan had a look of disdain on his face, and his gaze toward the Subduing Tree King held some anger.

Hearing this, the Beyond Grade As flying around looked at him strangely.

Scolding the enemy is nothing. If it was a private chat, it would have been fine. However, you are scolding openly, and we can clearly hear you attacking all Pugilists. If you were not playing a mind game, then doesn’t your scolding involve our Pugilists as well?

At this moment, Sierron flew past them and said with a displeased expression, “Don’t involve us Pugilists even if you want to insult the enemy.”

Dylan glanced at him and said matter-of-factly, “You’re also trash.”

“...Don’t stop me, I’m going to kill him now!”

Sierron was furious.

“Mission is more important. Ignore him.” Sun Hunter quickly grabbed Sierron’s finger and dragged him away without much effort.

The current Dylan had already completely adapted to the identity of the Underworld Hero Spirit, and he no longer had any scruples when speaking. The Beyond Grade As were no longer willing to lower themselves to his level. After all, what was the point in bickering with a dead person?

On the battlefield, the Subduing Tree King retreated as he fought. His attacks were filled with rage, and the power of his attacks increased.

Hila caught up once again. The red and black giant’s fists continued to punch, and its arms pulled back and forth like rubber. However, the current Subduing Tree King did not have any interest in being in a stalemate with her. Every move he made exploded with all his strength, and they all landed on Hila’s body.

After a few rounds, Hila was beaten up badly and she was at a disadvantage.

Although she was also good at close combat in this form, there was still a gap between her and the Subduing Tree King, who was going all out. After all, the Pugilist class still had some meaning...

Bang! The fist, shining with the green light of the cross, landed deeply on the red-black giant’s body, and the surging Pugilist flames entered the giant’s body. The next moment, a green light suddenly lit up in the red-black giant’s body. It expanded in the blink of an eye and dyed its entire body a dazzling green color. It exploded from the inside out!

Like a balloon exploding, the highly concentrated death energy that formed the body directly exploded, turning into red light fragments that filled the sky, and Hila’s body was exposed.

Before Hila could retreat, the Subduing Tree King grabbed her neck and slammed his other hand into Hila’s face, sending blood and broken bones flying. “Powerful!”

With a flash of golden light, Hila’s heavily injured face instantly recovered. The pain did not affect her movements at all. She condensed her death energy and was about to deal damage to the Subduing Tree King.

However, the Subduing Tree King understood her intentions. He raised his leg and kicked her heavily on her abdomen, interrupting her movements. He kicked her body until it folded and flew backward. Her spine was already broken by the huge penetrative force. “Cough cough cough,” Hila spat out a mouthful of blood, controlled her muscles to adjust the position of her spine, connected the broken nerves and blood vessels, and absorbed a trace of life energy from her Soul Connection with Aurora, allowing her injuries to recover quickly.

The form of ‘Reaper Liberation’ was destroyed, and it was still on cooldown. Although Hila did not intend to admit defeat, she had no choice but to face the reality that she could not defeat the Subduing Tree King and analyzed the current situation.

“Although I can still continue fighting the Subduing Tree King, I can’t hold him back. This will allow him to escape...”

Hila’s eyes were still filled with the desire to fight, but she was afraid of ruining Han Xiao’s goal, so she could only suppress it.

“Does it hurt?”

Seeing that she did not continue to charge forward, the Subduing Tree King narrowed his eyes and did not pursue her.

Although he was left alone due to his carelessness, causing a large group of Beyond Grade As from the three Universal Civilizations to surround him, the many World Tree Supers returned in time and broke through the encirclement that had yet to take shape, dragging the situation back into a chaotic battle. Therefore, the Subduing Tree King was still in a good situation and was not surrounded.

The Subduing Tree King observed the situation and felt much more relaxed. Although Hila was not easy to deal with, she could not stop him at all. With his ability, as long as there was no Beyond Grade A like Black Star to hold him back, the chances of him escaping were still very high. The retreat was stopped because of him, but he was still safe. The negative outcome was only sacrificing more of his comrades... Although it was a bit of a loss, as long as he, the Tree King, returned, these losses could still be accepted. After all, his hibernation would be much longer than the average World Tree expert.

“I didn’t think that a simple probe would be so dangerous. I can’t act casually next time.”

The Subduing Tree King did not chase after Hila but retreated.

However, at this moment, a strong sense of danger suddenly appeared, as though a large hand had grabbed onto his heart.

The Subduing Tree King’s expression changed slightly as he looked toward the source of the sensation.

A figure appeared beside Hila out of thin air. He did not look special on the outside and looked very ordinary. His expression was calm, but he exuded an evil and crazy aura that could not be hidden.

EsGod tilted his head and looked at the World Tree Roots beside the Subduing Tree King. He smiled and sighed.

“How many years has it been? I’ve finally seen this thing with my own eyes... Heh, if I hadn’t seen it, I might not have been imprisoned for nearly a hundred years.”

The Subduing Tree King frowned. He felt a strong threat from this stranger.

He had already blocked the mental fluctuations of outsiders, so he had no idea what EsGod was talking about. He turned around and ran without hesitation.

This unfamiliar Beyond Grade A that had suddenly appeared was not a simple character, and it would be difficult to determine the victor in a short time. If he was dragged here, it would be dangerous. Thus, the Subduing Tree King did not want to continue fighting.

However, before he could fly far, the smiling EsGod had already teleported in front of him.

The Subduing Tree King’s eyes darkened, and a powerful flame condensed in his fist. He aimed at EsGod, planning to use the shockwave to force EsGod back.

A green Pugilist beam shot out with enough power to destroy an entire planet. However, EsGod only raised his hand casually and activated his Esper Ability, refracting the beam of light which then shattered a large number of starships like a laser.

“Esper?”

The Subduing Tree King’s eyes flashed, but he did not plan to stop. He quickly closed the distance between them and punched out with his fist.

Bang! The fist landed on EsGod’s chest without any resistance, but all the power disappeared without a trace.

The Subduing Tree King’s expression changed. Just as he was about to retract his fist, EsGod slapped him back. Green light gushed out and reflected the power of the Subduing Tree King’s previous attack.

Boom!

A huge shockwave exploded in an instant, and the Subduing Tree King was sent flying.

He immediately stopped moving and looked at EsGod in shock. He removed his mental shield and could not help but ask,

“What ability is this?”

“Guess.”

EsGod smiled.

Even with the support of his Esper Ability, he would still be injured if he took such a blow head-on. In the past, he would have to worry about the burden on his body, so he did not dare to do this. He rarely fought head-on. Now, his body was only temporary, and he did not have to care about any consequences at all.

EsGod had a rare feeling of having nothing to worry about. He hooked his finger at the Tree King

“Come, let me see the ability of a Tree King.”

“...Your ability is not bad. You can absorb my power and reflect it back, but you don’t have the right to show off in front of me.”

The Subduing Tree King quickly calmed down and looked at EsGod coldly.

In this short exchange, he had already realized how difficult EsGod was to deal with. He thought that EsGod’s Esper Ability was to reflect attacks and that he was good at defense. He must be stalling him, he thought.

However, EsGod smiled.

“Is that so?”

Buzz!

The next moment, sixty to seventy doppelgangers separated from EsGod’s main body. Each doppelganger had a different ability, and they all released the aura of a Beyond Grade A, instantly attracting the attention of everyone present. “This is...”

Alarm bells rang in the Subduing Tree King’s heart, and his expression changed drastically.

He had originally thought that this unknown expert would only be difficult to deal with and would only be able to stall him at most. The true danger came from the siege of the other Beyond Grade As... but at this moment, the sense of danger EsGod gave him was almost similar to Black Star’s.

“So this civilization actually has such strong experts hidden...”

The Subduing Tree King’s heart was heavy as he waited. Facing such an opponent, he did not dare to think about escaping.

The next second, EsGod and all his doppelgangers attacked at the same time. Various Esper Abilities formed a perfect combination.

In a direct confrontation, EsGod might not be the strongest among the Beyond Grade As, but due to his unparalleled abilities, he could be considered the peak among Beyond Grade As in techniques!

“Crap!”

An endless sense of oppression assaulted him, and the Subduing Tree King suddenly opened his eyes wide. He realized that he could not find any flaws, and he could not help but be shocked.

This powerful enemy in front of me has strength that exceeds my expectations. It seems like he has the strength to kill me alone
