Chapter 765 Prelude to Change

In some transit station at the border of the Shattered Star Ring.

In an olden style inn, Hadavy sat in the corner and drank a glass of strong wine. There were mixed blood elves performing on the stage with a beautiful tone lingering in his ears. The customers of the inn were of many different races, and they were laughing merrily.

The atmosphere was soothing, but Hadavy had a depressed look on his face.

A few months ago, Jorde had made use of him to launch a sneak attack against Black Star. Hadavy had terminated the cooperation with them in a fit of rage and left the secret war.

He had chosen to join the Bloodshed Land because he wanted to spar with Black Star and stimulate his potential through battle. After fighting Black Star more than ten times, he could not help but feel a sense of appreciation for Han Xiao. In his eyes, Black Star was an opponent worthy of respect.

Hadavy would rather lose to Black Star time and time again than use despicable methods to deal with him.

After this event, Hadavy no longer had the face to find Han Xiao to spar. He planned to leave the Shattered Star Ring and roam the other Star Fields. This was the reason he had visited the borders of the Shattered Star Ring.

Just when he was drinking and depressed, a conversation caught his attention.

“Have all of you heard? The fifth Beyond Grade A Super has appeared in the Shattered Star Ring!”

What? A new Beyond Grade A?

He was a Beyond Grade A seed and his target had always been becoming a Beyond Grade A Super. Thus, he paid close attention to this topic.

With his senses of a Calamity Grade Super, the conversation of the table beside him seemed to be right beside his ears.

“You have heard about it, too? I know about Black Star. There were reports about him a few years ago saying that he was the most likely person to become a Beyond Grade A Super in the Shattered Star Ring. I thought that it was no more than a farce at that time but never imagined that it would actually become the truth.”

“He is the leader of the Black Star Army. All of you should know about the Black Star Army, right? It is the famous armed organization in the Colton Star Cluster. I have a friend who is a merchant. Once, his merchant ship was robbed, and he sought help from the Mercenary League to solve the problem. They sent the Black Star Army, and the mercenaries of this organization are extremely friendly and reliable.”

“Didn’t he become low profile over the past few years?” someone else asked curiously. “I heard that news of him becoming a Beyond Grade A Super is only a rumor.”

“It isn’t a rumor. Even ‘Star Pupil’ Psyker admitted that he only fought Black Star to a draw. If he is able to fight a Beyond Grade A Super without losing, he can only be a Beyond Grade A Super.”

Ka-la!

Hadavy crushed the wine glass in his hands, and wine splashed all over his body. However, he was still in a daze with a look of shock on his face.

Black Star has actually become a Beyond Grade A Super already‽

Upon hearing news of his old opponent, Hadavy could not help but be filled with envy and jealousy. He had spent a few decades but not touched the door of Beyond Grade A. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

He had already given it his all but was still overtaken by others. After being filled with shock, his heart was filled with bitterness.

Why can he do it? What trick did he use?

Hadavy’s face changed color, and he hammered down on the table before standing up abruptly. The sudden commotion attracted the gaze of all the customers present.

Ignoring the strange looks on their faces, Hadavy left the inn.

He came to a decision. He would not leave the Shattered Star Ring but make a trip to the headquarters of the Black Star Army.

This time, he would not go on behalf of the Bloodshed Land but using his personal identity.

Perhaps Black Star would not recognize an old opponent like him, and his life might be in danger...

However, he had been troubled by the problem of becoming a Beyond Grade A Super for many years. He decided to take this risk. Regardless of whether Black Star showed him any respect, he wanted to give it a shot.

...

The headquarters of the Mercenary League in the Gelock Star Cluster was a gigantic space fortress built by Black Star, Sky Ring, Blades, and many other large sized mercenary groups. Surrounding the gigantic space fortress were more than twenty armed satellites that were the branches of the respective large sized mercenary groups. The Black Star Army also had a branch located there. To all the members of the Mercenary League, this was akin to a second headquarters.

The million or so new players who were on Planet Deirdre had participated in many different storylines.

Some of them had chosen to join the secret war while others had chosen to remain in the Gelock Star Cluster and follow the storyline of the Mercenary League.

The storyline mission of the Mercenary League also gave huge rewards, and with the background of the Black Star Army, the players had plenty of mercenary missions to choose from.

After a few months, the average level of the players had risen rapidly, and they were all approaching level sixty.

Han Xiao’s legends had spread to the Mercenary League, and the players in the branch had also heard about it.

After the news spread, a huge commotion was created on the forums, and the players were all shocked.

Han Xiao was an NPC that the players were extremely familiar with, and many of the players respected him as the leader of their faction. They had witnessed his growth from Version 1.0 to Version 3.0, and Han Xiao was a legendary character in the Shattered Star Ring to the players.

At this moment, a new chapter of this legend had begun.

All the players who participated in the secret war were even more shocked. Black Star had disappeared from the battlefield for a few months, and many of them had been guessing Black Star’s whereabouts. However, none of them had guessed that he would return as a Beyond Grade A Super!

This news became a hot topic on the forums, and all the players of the Black Star Army were extremely agitated. As part of the Black Star Army, the promotion of their leader brought them glory as well.

“What else is there to say? Our Army Commander is the coolest! Black Star is the coolest!”

“There were only four Beyond Grade A Supers in the Shattered Star Ring before this, and Black Star is the fifth. Does this mean that our army is going to become a Beyond Grade A organization as well?”

“Of course!”

“Wahahaha. Our Planet Aquamarine faction leader is too awesome. We can match up to all the other factions in the other player regions alone. A growth type faction is too tyrannical.”

“@Summer Night Flower, stop hiding. Get over here!”

“@Summer Night Flower, how’s life in Bloodshed Land? Come out and share your experiences with us. We won’t laugh at you. Hahaha...”

“@Summer Night Flower, please begin your performance.”

“@Summer...”

Summer Night Flower’s post from a few months ago was now trending, and many players were gloating at his misfortune.

Seeing the excitement of the other players, Summer Night Flower did not dare show himself.

What is going on? The storyline shouldn’t be like this!

Some were feeling their nuts ache while others were overjoyed. Compared to Summer Night Flower, Bun-Hit-Dog was overjoyed.

Bun-Hit-Dog had been frustrated over not having any good material the last few months, but Black Star had gone and become a peak expert in the galaxy during this period. There was no better material than this.

He already had some ideas. This can be a milestone episode in the Black Star series.

Many of the older players were having merry conversations on the forums while the new players read the posts from the side silently. The newbies from Version 3.0 did not have very deep feelings toward Black Star, but after participating in the conversation, they had a much deeper impression of Han Xiao.

Very quickly, the news became an official report that was placed on the desks of various large organizations, causing an even greater commotion at a higher level.

Compared to the galactic residents who only wanted to join in the fun, the various organizations of the Shattered Star Ring had to consider how the birth of a new Beyond Grade A would affect the situation in the Shattered Star Ring as well as how they should interact with Black Star.

...

On Planet Heber, Jorde stood up abruptly after reading the report and had a look of disbelief on his face.

“Black Star is a Beyond Grade A‽ How is this possible! Didn’t I...”

All of a sudden, his heart was thrown into a mess. His scheme had originally forced Black Star to back out from the war, but Black Star had now become a Beyond Grade A.

All his plans were disrupted!

Jorde hurried over to the Tyrant’s abode and looked at Heber. Just when he was about to give a report, Heber took the initiative to speak.

“I know about it already. Klent just contacted me about it; they are extremely flustered. They are trying to verify the truth at the moment and told me to make preparations.”

Heber sounded as though he was a little excited.

Upon hearing that, Jorde calmed himself down and asked, “What should I do?”

“You don’t have to do anything,” Heber said slowly. “When Black Star or Purple Crystal admits that he is a Beyond Grade A, it will become my business.”

Jorde could not help but gulp in anticipation. The Tyrant... His Excellency Heber was about to take action!

Heber shook his head and got Jorde to leave. Heber was the only one left in the palace.

Du! Du!

Right at this moment, his communicator rang.

Heber looked at the caller, and his eyes narrowed.

“Psyker? It has been a long time since he last contacted me. Why is this fellow looking for me?”

...

In some region of the Shattered Star Ring, the final Light Fox spaceship was escaping. This fellow was the last of EsGod’s subordinates who was lucky enough to survive.

“I lost contact with Orozen and the others, and don’t know where the Evolution Cube went. What should we do?”

“They should be dead. Black Star became a Beyond Grade A Super and fought Psyker. The Evolution Cube may be in his hands.”

“Quickly report this matter to EsGod. We failed.”

...

Very quickly, news spread across the Star Field to every level and region, and more and more people found out about this piece of news.

The entire Shattered Star Ring was shaken!

As long as a new Beyond Grade A was born, it would definitely become the headlines of the Star Field for a long period of time.

Every Beyond Grade A figure had once been in the spotlight of the entire world.

It was now Han Xiao’s turn to enjoy such treatment.

The attention of the Shattered Star Ring was gathered on the Black Star Army. Rumors were rumors after all, and everyone was waiting for the new Beyond Grade A to announce his status in the Star Field and admit his strength personally.

However, regardless of the rumors in the outside world, Black Star did not appear, and the Black Star Army did not release a statement. The media was blocked out of the headquarters of the Black Star Army, and even their ally Purple Crystal was unusually quiet.

The longer this lasted, the more anxious the other organizations became, desperate to confirm Black Star’s strength.

Everyone was waiting to see what would happen next.

By that point, Han Xiao had returned to the Black Star Army and summoned all his officers.
