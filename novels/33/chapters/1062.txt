1065 The Wolf Is Besieged and Annihilated

Ending his long-range projection, Han Xiao opened his eyes within his palace, his emotions overflowing in joy.

“Seven Calamity Grades joined, with one of them even being a Beyond Grade A seed. This wave of talents is good quality.”

He had only been interested in the resources accumulated by the Beast Ancestor and did not covet the latter’s offspring because both sides were enemies after all. Even if he were to forcefully accept the troops and force the descendants to work for him, there would always be resistance.

There was also a chance that they would not put in their best effort, and their numbers would allow them to pollute the army and form a faction, which would become a ticking time bomb.

A melon that is forcefully plucked will not be sweet.

The losses would outweigh the gains. Furthermore, the Black Star Army was already part of the Lawful Faction, so they could not go too overboard. At the same time, they did not lack manpower in the army at the moment, so he was not interested in poaching the manpower of the Beast Ancestor.

That being said, if it was those who decided to voluntarily pledge themselves to the Black Star Army, he naturally would not reject them.

“The majority of people from the rebel faction are still waiting, and Jotina’s batch is only the first wave of guinea pigs. There will definitely be more of them in the future. Even I don’t know the exact number.”

Han Xiao did not wish to capture all these people in one go, as each individual had their own ambitions. Some of them might not necessary chose to defect to him if they were to betray the Beast Ancestor Organization. Some would choose to resign completely, burying their lives and living in a low-profile manner.

Shaking his head, Han Xiao temporarily put this matter aside and summoned Phillip.

“Notify Herlous and Sylvia. Tell them to mobilize the soldiers of the Shattered Star Ring to send a fleet over to the Beast Ancestor’s base to free all the slaves and to destroy his offspring cultivation assembly line.”

Due to the high difficulty level of the mission [Ending the Darkness], he could not progress in it at the moment. In contrast, the other missions were quite simple, and since he had already given the other party his word, Han Xiao swung into action. With Jotina joining him, he would also have sufficient reason to send out troops.

Furthermore, since Gorutan had brought out a large number of elites, his base was quite empty. Thus, it also reduced the difficulty. As long as the fleet brought along his own avatar as a guarantee, there should not be any accidents.

This group of guys who had forsaken the darkness for the light brought Han Xiao plenty of good news. However, there was one detail that made Han Xiao sit up and take notice.

He always felt that the look Jotina had in her eyes seemed a little bit too eager...

It was like how he normally looked at Feidin.

In the stronghold of the Beast Ancestor’s base in the Emerald Star Cluster, after Jotina and her group broke out, the atmosphere became silent and cold. There was less chatter. They were obviously brothers and sisters, but the looks they exchanged were filled with vigilance, and more thoughts were hiding behind their poker faces.

As the people’s hearts changed, the undercurrents surged.

Jotina was the first defector, and there were still many more of the cautious rebels watching the situation. Seeing that she had a good start, more of them started to get ready to move.

Within a secret room, a group of people from the rebel factions gathered together quietly. Their leader was a prestigious Calamity Grade officer, ‘Boa Constrictor’ Schneider. While he was not at the level of the four major officers, he was still one of the more influential officers, an elite combatant who combined his Pugilist skills with his innate toxin talents.

“I believe you know my purpose behind gathering all of you.” Schneider looked around, his eyes stopping for a while on the stronger officers before continuing, “There’s news from Sister Jotina, she says that Black Star has already accepted them. They have found a good home.”

No one present spoke, waiting for him to finish.

Seeing this, Schneider said, “The loyal faction fought with Jotina and suffered heavy losses. They probably no longer wish to waste any more strength in dealing with the defectors. It’s about time for us to leave as well. I know that there are a few among us that do not wish to defect to another organization and wish to be independent. All of this can wait for when we leave. For those that are unwilling to follow and walk your own paths, we will meet again somewhere in the universe and reminisce about our familial ties then.”

After he was done, the room remained quiet for a moment before someone finally spoke out.

“That’s right. It’s time for us to leave. In another few days, it will be my troops’ turn to patrol. This is our chance, and it’s best to avoid any conflict with the loyalists.”

As soon as the silence was broken, everyone spoke in a rush. Everyone with some influence in the audience offered suggestions, brainstorming for the rebellion.

Meanwhile, a few of the loyalists were also having a secret meeting.

“Did you hear? It seems like the group of traitors from Jotina’s side joined the Black Star Army.”

“Where did this news come from? Is it reliable?”

“Many people saw their spaceship headed toward the stronghold of the Black Star Army, and after entering, they never came out. Furthermore, among that rebel faction that has a lot of hidden thoughts, there has been quite a bit of intelligence leaking out, so it should be accurate.”

One of them said in a deep voice, “If it’s true, then we can implement a bold plan. Let our people pretend to defect and enter the Black Star Army. We’ll find a chance to rescue Lord Father.”

“But... Black Star is a Beyond Grade A Mechanic. It’s hard to even be able to steal anything under his nose. Furthermore, there is no solution for the Spacetime Amber; even the three Universal Civilizations are left befuddled.”

“Lord Father has so painstakingly raised us. He’s our respected patriarch. Only we can help him now, so even if the odds are slim, we still have to try,” someone else replied firmly.

“Alright... but there’s still another problem. The defectors definitely know our allegiances, and the loyal factionists who attempt to defect will definitely be seen through.”

“This is a good question. After being together for so long, one cannot just break into the group of rebels...”

Everyone hesitated.

Jotina’s incident had provided hope to the loyalists. Some of them wanted to stage a rescue of Gorutan, who was made into a specimen. After all, he was just sealed and not dead yet.

At this time, the sound of a communicator rang, breaking the stale atmosphere in the room like a roar of thunder on a sunny day.

The leader looked at his communicator and said, “Byram has gathered all the officers to discuss our future plans.”

Everyone did not feel any surprise. After Gorutan’s fall, this sort of meeting had been held many times. Without a decision maker, the affairs of the organization could now only be decided by a large majority of the officers agreeing. However, everyone had their own plans, so there was no unified opinion.

The group of loyalists left the room, rushing toward the large conference room.

At this moment, the conference room was almost full of people. All those present were officers with a certain amount of influence, and the scene was as rowdy as a scene in a marketplace. The three factions of loyalist, rebels, and neutrals distinguished themselves clearly, all looking at each other with cold glares.

This group of loyalists immediately spotted Schneider and glared at him before finding their places.

Schneider did not care about their attitude. He had also heard the news when he was in his secret meeting and rushed over.

After waiting a while longer, all the officers were finally present. Byram was the last to enter, and he closed the door to the conference room. Under everyone’s gaze, he slowly walked up to the rostrum before looking down from his vantage point at everyone.

“What happened, for you to convene us again?” one of the officers demanded. The person in question was one of the Four Generals.

“We haven’t finished discussing the previous topic, so today, we’ll continue to discuss the future of our organization.” Byram calmly smiled before he changed the topic. “However, before that, let me introduce someone to you.”

Everyone frowned. From Byram’s attitude, they noticed something was wrong.

It was at this moment that a wave of magic appeared in the room, and a blue circle representing a transportation door appeared beside Byram.

Hum!

A foot slowly stepped out of the portal, and a strong sense of oppression soon followed. The air in the room seemed to freeze instantly.

The Secret Master walked out before waving a hand to close the transportation door. With his hands behind his back, he gazed at everyone present with an expression of indifference.

The entire room turned silent.

At this time, Byram broke the silence with a smile in his voice.

“I believe everyone is familiar with the Secret Master, who is also a patron of the Galactic Black Market just like Lord Father.

“Byram, what’s the meaning of this‽”

The group of loyalists immediately stood up, suppressing their anger as they questioned him.

In reality, everyone understood that Byram, who was part of the neutral faction, had already initiated a relationship with the Secret Master. Under the guise of a meeting, he had gathered all the officers so that the Secret Master could catch them all at once and control everyone.

He was going to present this stronghold and all the officers present to the Secret Master!

Byram only smiled in response. His gaze shifted to the Secret Master, and he explained, “Since Lord Father was captured, countless organizations have been watching us, wishing to divide us. Without a Beyond Grade A holding the helm, we’ve been a mess. Secret Master is an old friend of Lord Father, so he has decided to grant us asylum to help us weather our difficulties.”

Yes, spin, continue to spin your story!

Everyone cursed in their heart. The neutrals were surprised, the rebels had heavy hearts, and the loyalists were enraged.

The Secret Master took in everybody’s expressions before coldly speaking. “The situation is as thus. Gorutan and I have been partners for a long time, and I cannot just watch as his descendants split. I’ll temporarily take in the Beast Ancestor’s organization, and when the situation stabilizes, I’ll hand the rights back to you.”

F*ck your mom, what sympathy and what partners? Do you think we all have amnesia‽

Everyone gritted their teeth.

The Secret Master did not have an organization of the Black Star Army’s scale, so the warriors under the command of the Beast Ancestor were one of the resources he wished to gain.

Because he was not a direct enemy like Black Star, he would not need to worry about the issue of them taking revenge. Furthermore, he was also a patron of the Galactic Black Market, so it was more reasonable for him to receive the Beast Ancestor’s organization. His own organization already consisted of many mixed forces, belonging to the gray side, so there was no need to worry about suffering from indigestion from being unable to digest the Beast Ancestor’s troops.

This was merely an excuse for the Secret Master to embezzle the power of the Beast Ancestor, but even if the loyalists were angry, they dared not stand up against it.

The Secret Master had already spoken.

If you still do not know what’s good for you, then you won’t even have time to regret if this pinnacle Beyond Grade A here destroys you.

Thus, no one retorted after the Secret Master finished speaking, as though they all silently agreed.

At this moment, Schneider slowly stood up, attracting the eyes of everyone present, including the Secret Master.

He took a deep breath before speaking in a respectful tone.

“Many thanks to Your Excellency Secret Master for your generosity. Your asylum is something we urgently need, and I agree that you have to take over Lord Father’s organization for the time being.”

“Hmm, not bad.”

Secret Master nodded, feeling that this kid was on the right path.

However, this impression was destroyed by Schneider’s next sentence. “However, I’ve already grown tired of this kind of life, and I don’t wish to continue fighting in the universe. Now, I just wish to live the life of an ordinary person. Your Excellency, I’m not going against you, but everyone has their own ambitions. Please allow me to retire.”

Secret Master did not think much about it, replying, “You’re blessed with a Calamity Grade level combat power. To retire just like that would be a pity. I hope you will continue to find the passion in your current post. I’m optimistic about you, so don’t talk about resigning anymore. Sit down.”

Schneider gritted his teeth before mustering up the courage to speak again. “Your Excellency Secret Master. I wish to take a period of leave. My sister has defected to the Black Star Army, and I wish to tell her not to worry about things back home.”

Once this sentence was spoken, it could be considered as stating his stand. He implied that he did not wish to work under Secret Master but rather wished to lean toward Black Star.

Secret Master narrowed his eyes and stared at him. The pressure within the room got steadily stronger.

Only when Schneider started to sweat did Secret Master finally reply.

“I feel that there’s no need for that. When I formally take over, the universe will naturally receive the news. There’s no need to take unnecessary steps.”

Hearing this, Schneider as well as the people in the rebel factions all sighed in their hearts.

The attitude of Secret Master was clear. Even if he knew that they wanted to go over to Black Star, he still chose to detain everyone, not allowing any officers to leave in order to control them.

“Ha...” Schneider sighed before sitting down, an expression of regret on his face.

If he had known of this development, he would have acted more aggressively and taken action with Jotina. He was a step late.

The faces of the rebels were ugly, and their current emotions could be described as ‘being there in body but not in spirit’.

...

Secret Master publicly placed a magical imprint on all the officers to monitor their actions before speaking in a high-handed manner, emphasizing how deep his relationship was with Gorutan, and after spending so much time together, how they were practically brothers.

The crowd secretly rolled their eyes as they listened to the bullsh*t Secret Master was spouting. When the end of the meeting was announced, they could not wait to get up and leave the room, as though they were fleeing.

Soon, there were only two people left in the conference room. Byram came up to the Secret Master and smiled.

“Your Excellency Secret Master, congratulations on absorbing the troops of the Beast Ancestor.”

“This is only the first step. The Beast Ancestor still has many other camps and Star Fields.”

“I understand, but most of the people he has brought over to the Flickering World are important officers, and since you’re controlling them, you’re basically controlling almost half of the Beastman Organization.”

“Hmm. Anyways, you’ve done a good job. When this matter comes to an end, I’ll definitely reward you for your achievements.” The Secret Master nodded.

Hearing this, Byram’s smile grew wider.

After Jotina defected, Byram also decided to find a way out. It happened that Secret Master was also plotting on taking over the Beast Ancestor’s army, so both sides started communicating with each other and hit it off. Byram thus decided to assist the Secret Master.

The reason he did not choose Black Star was partly because the loyalist faction would never agree to submit under Black Star. Also, if he presented such a gift to their enemy, when news got out, his reputation would be ruined. Considering both factors, it was better to work with Secret Master instead.

Byram walked away in excitement, and after sending him off, Secret Master’s lips curled up in a sneer.

“Humph, merely a person who goes whichever way the wind blows.”

Shaking his head, Secret Master took out his communicator to contact Sorokin.

After three rings, the call was connected. Sorokin’s visage appeared on the screen, carrying a meaningful smile.

“Your Excellency Secret Master, have you managed to absorb the Beast Ancestor’s troops?”

“The initial steps are done.” Secret Master nodded. “However, it seems like Black Star has already stepped in. There are people who wish to defect to him...”

Sorokin smiled in response. “Relax, Black Star’s commanders are plentiful like the clouds, and he definitely will not target the Beast Ancestor’s troops so desperately. Anyway, there’s no reason not to be afraid to offend him. If you still feel unsafe, after absorbing the troops, just give Black Star suitable compensation, and he will not pursue this further.”

“Let’s talk about this when it comes.” Secret Master did not agree or disagree.

He was a mature person and wished to befriend Black Star. However, he also wished to obtain the Beast Ancestor’s troops, seemingly wanting to have his cake and eat it too. Since Black Star was not hard up for these people, he was not picking someone else’s fruits.

Sorokin paused for a moment before changing the topic. “So, about my suggestion, what are your thoughts?”

Secret Master narrowed his eyes. “You wish to use the position of shareholder in the Limitless Financial Group that was vacated by Galactic Black Market in exchange for the position of Protector of the Galactic Black Market. This idea is not bad at all.”

“Hehe, I’m a businessman and will only talk about business. Since Gorutan has fallen, I’ll require a new partner.” Sorokin smiled faintly.

During the time he worked with Gorutan, Sorokin had already penetrated many different industries within the Galactic Black Market. If he had the identity of a Protector, he would be able to officially open a business within the Galactic Black Market and could incorporate the entire Galactic Black Market into the business empire of his Limitless Financial Group. This was a huge profit that was simply incalculable!

Even Sorokin who sat on astronomical assets could not help but move!

Thus, no too long ago, he had gotten in touch with the Secret Master and proposed a deal in which the wolf would be besieged and annihilated—the original shareholder position would be handed over to the Secret Master, while the other party would aid him in obtaining the status of Protector in the Galactic Black Market.

After he proposed this transaction, Secret Master did not immediately reject him, but he did not agree either.

From the perspective of Secret Master, without Gorutan, he would be able to gobble up more shares of the Galactic Black Market. If he introduced a financial giant like Sorokin, it would be equivalent to attracting a wolf into the room. After all, no one knew what Sorokin intended to do.

However, if he exchanged it with the identity of a shareholder of the Limitless Financial Group, this would involve more legitimate businesses, and his profits would also increase. Thus came the Secret Master’s dilemma.

Hearing Sorokin bring this up again, Secret Master snorted.

“I’ll be honest, although the condition to become a Protector is to be a Beyond Grade A, with your strength, it seems hard for you to obtain the identity.”

Sorokin smiled mysteriously. “Wouldn’t this be better for you?”

Secret Master remained silent. It seemed as though he agreed with the statement.

He pondered for a while before speaking. “I can try to help you deal with and persuade the other two Protectors, as well as the administrators...”

Sorokin’s eyes lit up, knowing that this was the start to their partnership. His smile grew wide.

“Many thanks to Your Excellency Secret Master. I’ll keep the vacant seat of shareholder for the Limitless Financial Group open for you.”

“Hmm.” Secret Master answered indifferently before hanging up.
