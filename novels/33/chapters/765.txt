768 Announcement 2

This was the first time that Hadavy had heard of the Black Star Guards. However, this was not the first time that he had seen Hila.

There was a period of time when Han Xiao had taken Hila around the various frontline battlefields. Before leaving the Bloodshed Land, Hadavy had once looked through Hila’s file, and this was the first time that he had met her.

He looked around the surroundings, and the densely packed warriors blocked all avenues of escape.

“Where is Black Star? I want to see him!” Hadavy shouted.

“Our Army Commander isn’t someone you can meet whenever you want to,” Hila then replied coldly. “Hadavy, you have provoked our headquarters. You’d better surrender yourself right now.”

Upon hearing that, Hadavy looked at Hila and said provocatively, “And if not? Are you going to catch me?”

Hu!

Hila lost her patience and immediately took action. Blood-red energy gushed out from her body and smashed into Hadavy’s chest. It sent him flying into the sky, and a small red shockwave exploded.

The light faded, and Hadavy floated in midair with a solemn expression on his face.

As a well-known Beyond Grade A seed in the Shattered Star Ring; ordinary Calamity Grade Supers would not be able to harm him at all. However, Hila’s casual attack made him feel a wave of deathly energy invading his body. A portion of his cells became inactive, and he felt as though his life force was being absorbed.

Although the damage was not large, the destructive force of the red-haired woman before him was something that an ordinary Calamity Grade Super would not be able to match up to.

After obtaining the benefits of the Evolution Cube, she had experienced an obvious rise in combat strength, and her destructive force had become much more frightening. The death energy that she gave out could reduce the activity of her target and inflict special damage. Even Hadavy was not able to block it completely and had to treat her seriously.

Bang!

Hila’s stomp generated a sonic boom, and she shot toward the sky. The dense death energy was like a tsunami crashing down on Hadavy.

The two collided in midair, and an intense battle broke out. Rings of visible energy waves exploded forth, and the warriors by the side did not interfere in the battle between them. They left the battlefield to those two and watched from the side.

A portion of the Calamity Grade officers who were currently present watched the battle by the side and had no intention of interfering.

“Sylvia, do we really not need to intervene?” a Calamity Grade officer asked.

Sylvia shook her head and said, “His Excellency Black Star wants to set up the Black Star Guards. It isn’t to protect him but to let the various organizations know that he has an elite force under his command. Hadavy is a powerful fellow, and Hila will be able to gain a great amount of fame as long as she doesn’t lose to him. This will be the first impression the world has of the Black Star Guards.”

“But if she loses, won’t...”

“Someone personally chosen by my teacher won’t lose so easily.”

The scene of Hila and Hadavy fighting was recorded by all the galactic reporters in the surroundings. This group of reporters watched the fight unblinkingly as they wrote their draft, recording the entire process of how Hadavy charged into the Black Star Army headquarters and was stopped by the Black Star Guards under Black Star.

Boom boom boom!

Both of them were Calamity Grade Supers, and the impact of their battle was not small. Hila trapped Hadavy in the center and unleashed her death energy on him.

Hadavy’s body hardening Esper Ability had been developed to a perverse level. Despite that, plenty of scars were still left behind on his body. It was not that he did not have the ability to escape, but he naturally would not escape since he was there to meet Han Xiao.

The dense, red waterfall of death energy knocked Hadavy out of the sky, and he crashed onto the alloy ground.

Boom!

Hadavy hurriedly got up and avoided Hila’s follow-up attack while looking back at Hila with a strange gaze. Hila’s attack would not threaten his life but made him seem extremely pathetic. Her strength had truly shocked him.

The Black Star Army had a few Calamity Grade officers. In the past, Lagi was the only one who could give Hadavy some pressure, so Hila was the second.

Black Star has more and more experts under him, Hadavy thought to himself.

What a powerful body. Hila frowned.

Death energy then surrounded her body as though she was on fire.

Hadavy’s expression turned solemn, and he got into a defensive position. His muscles then bulged up like steel.

The army members watching the battle by the side also began backing off. They knew that the following attack would create a large shockwave, and they might be injured if they were to close.

Just as Hila was about to launch her attack, a deep voice sounded from behind the crowd.

“Hila, that’s enough.”

Everyone looked over and saw Han Xiao floating over slowly with an immense pressure bearing down on everyone present. The entire place fell silent, and even a falling needle could have been heard.

Everyone’s gaze was locked on Han Xiao.

Upon hearing those words, Hila snorted coldly and retracted her death energy.

The crowd then opened a path, and Han Xiao walked in front of Hadavy. “You want to see me?”

In truth, Han Xiao had arrived a long time ago and allowed both Hila and Hadavy to fight for a short while before stopping them.

Just as Sylvia had suspected, since he had set up the Black Star Guards, he had to help Hila build up her prestige in the Star Field. Hadavy was a classic meat shield, and his attacking strength was low. With Hila’s current strength, she would be able to fight Hadavy for some time without losing, and this was the best chance to build up her prestige.

The galactic reporters by the side all grew excited. Ever since the rumors began to spread in the outside world, this was the first time that Black Star had appeared in public. Thus, all their attention was placed on him.

“You finally came out!” Hadavy’s eyes lit up. This was the result that he wanted to see. “Do you still remember me?”

“How can I forget you?” Han Xiao said with a tinge of interest. “Aren’t you a member of Bloodshed Land? Are you coming to my headquarters to provoke me?”

“I have already left Bloodshed Land, and I am here to represent myself only,” Hadavy explained.

“Oh... then what do you want?”

“I wish to issue you a challenge!” Hadavy suddenly said loudly. “I am willing to use myself as the stakes for this battle!”

Han Xiao was stunned for a moment, and doubt could be seen in his eyes.

“What exactly do you want?”

“If I lose, I will join the Black Star Army and fight for you like I once fought for Bloodshed Land. If I win...” Hadavy paused for a moment. “If I win, I want you to be my subordinate.”

Upon hearing that, Han Xiao could not help but laugh in his heart. He had already seen through Hadavy’s true thoughts.

This fellow has probably come here because I became a Beyond Grade A Super. For him to insist on challenging me even after knowing that I have become a Beyond Grade A Super, he probably has two motives. First, he wants to spar with a Beyond Grade A Super and thinks that I won’t kill him on account of the fact that we are old opponents. Second, he wants to join me after losing to me.

Hadavy had always wanted to become a Beyond Grade A Super, and his heart was becoming itchy after witnessing Han Xiao becoming a Beyond Grade A. Thus, Hadavy wanted to join Han Xiao so that he could seek help from him. However, although Hadavy was tempted by such a thought, he was not willing to directly join the Black Star Army because of his pride. He did not want to lower his head before his old opponent directly and thus chose to put on a show and use the excuse of losing the battle to join the Black Star Army.

Defeat was not humiliating to Hadavy, but lowering his head was. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

After thinking for a moment, Han Xiao nodded and agreed without exposing Hadavy.

When they were opponents, Hadavy was truly annoying and was a sh*t stirrer. However, if this meat shield wanted to join him, he would be a rare treasure in Han Xiao’s eyes. After all, there were very few Beyond Grade A seeds.

Putting on a show to gain a powerful fighter—such a deal was very much worth it.

Furthermore, Han Xiao felt that he could make use of this chance to display his strength to the Star Field. The influence of him becoming a Beyond Grade A could only be utilized if he admitted it personally.

He had already constructed a new army, and he was able to display the strength of a Beyond Grade A. Furthermore, the Tyrant would not allow him to drag things on for too long.

Han Xiao was extremely clear about the thoughts of his enemy. If he continued dragging on as such, Klent would then announce to the world that he did not dare to reveal his strength because he was afraid of Heber. They would then be able to suppress his influence while boosting the Tyrant’s prestige.

He had stayed silent for half a month already, and Klent was already showing signs of doing so. He decided to avoid such a situation before Klent took action.

Han Xiao shook off all these thoughts and looked at Hadavy. “Come.”

Boom!

Hadavy stomped on the alloy ground and shot toward Han Xiao’s chest like a cannon.

The muscles on his arms bulged up, and an explosive strength burst forth.

However, Hadavy’s fist was stopped ten centimeters before Han Xiao, and the immense strength of the attack generated a powerful gust of wind. However, Han Xiao did not even blink.

At this moment, his arm, which was covered in the Battle Tiger suit, grabbed onto Hadavy’s throat. Hadavy’s powerful attack could not even shake Han Xiao’s arm, and Hadavy was not able to move forward even an inch after being grabbed by Han Xiao’s arm.

Advancing to Beyond Grade A and the boost from the Evolution Cube had largely increased Han Xiao’s attributes and allowed him to completely suppress a Calamity Grade Super. Even Hadavy, who was famous for his body’s strength, was not an opponent for Han Xiao.

“This...” Hadavy’s eyes narrowed.

Before he could even react, the mechanical suit on Han Xiao’s arm began spinning around rapidly and sent a powerful shockwave into Hadavy’s body through his arm.

The special sound wave attack flowed through Hadavy’s skin and echoed in his flesh and bones. Hadavy heard a ringing sound as though all the noise in the world had been pumped into his ears.

Tiger Roar!

With the target’s body as a medium, the special shockwave attack would pass through all forms of armor and echo within the target’s body. If this attack was used in a vacuum, it would only be effective in close-range battle. This was an attack that Han Xiao had created by mimicking Stephanie’s Esper Ability.

“Pu!” Hadavy spat out a mouthful of blood. Because it was not True Damage, he was not immune to it.

Following which, Han Xiao slammed him into the ground.

Bang!

A crater was created, and Hadavy was stuck in the crater.

Not waiting for him to get up, Han Xiao placed his hands together, and his body lit up with brilliant bolts of electricity. The Mechanical Force that he gave out then combined with the alloy ground.

Boom!

The next moment, the alloy ground sprang into action, and the alloy ground transformed into a whirlpool to trap Hadavy in the center. The alloy ground then began spinning upward and formed a small spinning mountain.

Hadavy could not move an inch.

“Pa!” Han Xiao then clapped his hands, and two cannons were revealed behind him. The barrels of the cannons were aimed straight at Hadavy. If Han Xiao shot at Hadavy, who was currently in the air, his cannon would shoot toward outer space and would not destroy the headquarters.

The barrels of the cannons lit up, and the frightening energy being gathered made everyone’s hair stand on end.

“My destructive force isn’t the same as before,” Han Xiao said slowly. “You may become paralyzed if these two cannons hit you. Admit defeat.”

Hadavy gulped in horror, and his heart was shaken.

He had challenged Han Xiao because he wanted to verify the difference between the Beyond Grade A Black Star and the Black Star from before. In the end, he realized that the gap between them had widened to the point where he did not have the ability to make Han Xiao get serious.

Was this the difference in a Beyond Grade A? Hadavy felt his heart burning.

“I... admit defeat.” Hadavy took a deep breath and admitted his loss.

Han Xiao had already expected this and said, “Hila, bring him down.”

Clank!

The alloy mountain then collapsed. and Hadavy fell to the ground. Hila immediately walked forward and slapped a pair of electromagnetic handcuffs on his wrists. The handcuffs were not very useful and were only for show. Hadavy was then led into the headquarters of the Black Star Army.

Han Xiao then turned around and looked at the numerous spaceships in the surrounding area. With a simple shake of his head, he connected to the quantum network.

The reporters on the spaceship were currently recording the scene before them and writing about how Han Xiao had easily taken care of Hadavy. All of a sudden, Han Xiao’s face appeared on every screen in the spaceships, and all the reporters were startled.

Following which, Han Xiao’s voice sounded on the screen.

“I know that all of you have been lingering in the vicinity to hear me admit the recent rumors. Yes, I am already a Beyond Grade A. Please help me spread the news around the entire Star Field!”

After saying what he wanted, Han Xiao’s face disappeared from the screen, and the screens returned to normal.

The jaws of the reporters dropped, and they finally snapped back to reality. They immediately jumped to the window of the spaceship and looked toward the Black Star Army satellite, only to see Han Xiao turn around and walk back into the headquarters.

“He admitted it! Black Star admitted it personally!”

All the reporters were overjoyed. After camping for such a long time, they had finally gotten some exciting news.

An official announcement was completely different from rumors being spread around. Rumors were like sparks to ignite the flames of curiosity in the Star Field, but Han Xiao’s admission was like pouring hot oil on top of the fire!

The influence of a new Beyond Grade A would reach the peak in a single step!
