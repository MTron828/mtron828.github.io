1077 Holy Accord and Primordial Ones

“Not in this era?” Ames said with a weird expression. “Why do you say that?”

Han Xiao paused and did not answer this question. He changed the topic and said softly, “This is a secret organization focused on studying and inventing Esper Ability technology. They’re also a mysterious arms dealer. Their products occasionally appear on the black market, and now they’ve set their eyes on the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy...”

Han Xiao could not give a lot of information to Ames, so he only briefly explained it while being shocked inside.

In his previous life, the first time this organization appeared publicly was during the World Tree Civilization War. As members of the explored universe, they joined the war and fought against the World Tree Civilization’s invasion, using their technology in the war.

However, it was only Version 4.0 Flickering World now, many versions before the World Tree storyline. These people should not have appeared in this era, hence his shock.

The name of this organization was ‘Holy Accord’. It was extremely mysterious even in the very late versions in his previous life. Most of the people who knew about this organization were the offspring of Beyond Grade As.

Other than this Esper Ability technology, there were also many renowned Beyond Grade As in the history who were already confirmed dead who joined the World Tree war together with the Holy Accord. It was as if they had revived and come back to the universe. There were even extremely famous Primordial Ones among them.

This organization, which had a new type of technology, and those high-level combatants became powerful reinforcements to the losing side back then, causing a lot of damage to the World Tree Civilization.

The revival of these Beyond Grade As was a humongous boost to everyone’s morale. However, the reason for their revival was still an enigma to the players. The advanced civilizations locked the information down, so the players had no way of finding out anything about it. Therefore, even Han Xiao did not know the truth behind it.

However, although the Holy Accord organization’s first appearance was during the World Tree war, it was not the same for the Primordial Ones. During as early as the Calamity of the Supers version, there was already a batch of Primordial Ones who had awakened and become the triggers of the Calamity of the Supers.

Back then, the explanation these Primordial Ones gave to the outside world was that they faked their death during the exploration era and had been sleeping in advanced life-sustaining cabins ever since in order to avoid the bloody exploration era warfare and not die for nothing. They hoped to awaken in the future and conquer the universe in the new era.

However, something seemed to have gone wrong. The place they were sleeping in was also devoured by the flames of war. Their life-sustaining cabins floated in the universe and landed on a desolate island. At the same time, the life-sustaining cabins malfunctioned, causing them to not be able to awaken at their intended time. Hence, they had no choice but to spend countless years in that sleeping state. Although the specially made life-sustaining cabins could slow down the degradation of their body and soul, they were still slowly heading toward their demise.

Coincidentally, when they were close to their end, a research team happened to dig them out and reactivated their life-sustaining cabins. Only then did they awaken from their long sleep. After that, they spent a very long time recovering back to their peak performance.

At that time, the only thing the outside world was sure of was the revival of these Primordial Ones. As for the flaws this explanation had such as how could Beyond Grade As be restrained by these tiny life-sustaining cabins, since there were no ways to prove if that was true, the public had no choice but to believe them.

In conclusion, in the later versions in Han Xiao’s previous life, there were two batches of different Primordial Ones who awakened at different timings. Once during the Calamity of the Supers, once during the World Tree war.

The first batch of Primordial Ones who awakened in the Calamity of the Supers version did not seem to be related to the Holy Accord organization. However, whether they really had nothing to do with the Holy Accord organization or not, the players in his previous life had no way of knowing. Hence, Han Xiao did not know the connection between them.

If these two events were related, the first batch of Primordial Ones who awakened during the Calamity of the Supers probably lied. They might not have returned from life-sustaining cabins.

“The Holy Accord organization...”

Han Xiao pondered over their intentions.

It was clear that this organization had existed for a while but had never interfered with the outside world. Now, they had suddenly attacked him. This meant that the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy was extremely important to the Holy Accord organization, so much so that it was worth attacking someone who stood at the peak of the universe. According to the characteristics of the Holy Accord organization, could they be planning to invent some dark new technology with the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy?

If that was the case, the Holy Accord organization might have done something similar in his previous life... Han Xiao’s eyes sparkled.

Assuming this was true, the Holy Accord organization might have worked with EsGod in his previous life by splitting up other Primal Esper Ability Entities in exchange for the resources in EsGod’s hands, including the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy.

This meant that some of those Super High Risk Esper Abilities EsGod possessed in the later versions might have been provided by the Holy Accord organization...

It would not have mattered if Han Xiao did not know, but since he knew that the Holy Accord already existed at this time, he could not help but become deeply interested in them.

“The Holy Accord organization fled right after attacking, thinking they would not expose their identity. They couldn’t have guessed that I knew their identity all along.”

Han Xiao raised his brows and was in a much better mood.

Compared to this huge discovery, suffering a small loss was nothing.

“The dynasty’s Clotti was taken away by the chaotic space stream. Will he be okay?” Ames asked curiously. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Don’t worry, he’s just lost. With his strength and the Universal Treasures in his hands, he will be able to escape very soon.”

Han Xiao did not worry about Dark Lord. No matter where Clotti ended up, he would be at the top of the food chain in that secondary dimension.

However, since the chaotic space streams could not be tracked, he had no way of fishing Clotti out. This was also the reason the Holy Accord organization used the Dimensional Exile Bullet to send themselves into the chaotic space streams.

Since the Virtual Intrusion had been interrupted by the virus, Han Xiao could not leave any markings in their spaceships. However, he would be more alert next time and clear the virus before it infected him. This kind of trap would not be very useful then.

Han Xiao looked at the containment device of the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy. This guy was extremely mad and kept bashing the inside wall of the container while screaming in agony.

“Ahhh! It hurts so much!”

Seeing this, Han Xiao pitied him.

In his previous life, it was also torn apart by others. He had thought that since EsGod had been dealt with, the same thing would not happen to the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy again. Surprisingly, it happened all the same, as if he was fated to be torn apart.

Furthermore, he might have been treated even worse. After all, in his previous life, EsGod simply used his abilities and never tortured him or anything. The Holy Accord organization, however, would definitely study him, which meant that the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy would feel all kinds of pain from that part of his body that was taken away.

Han Xiao pitied him even more and asked, “By the way, how did it feel earlier? Were you unable to control your body?”

“That’s right. I don’t know what method they used. They stimulated my core and caused me to lose control of my body before using an irresistible force to drag me over.”

Han Xiao then asked, “Can you feel the location of that part of your body?”

“Of cou...” Before the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy finished, as if he was suddenly shocked, his entire body shrunk as he yelled, “Ah! My senses are blocked!”

Han Xiao raised his brows but was not surprised.

After all, they were professionals in studying the Primal Esper Ability Entities. There was no way they would leave such an obvious clue to let others chase after them.

“Hahaha!” The Holy Light Particle was rolling on the ground laughing. “Karma! The day has finally come!”

Filled with sorrow and hatred, the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy said, “Black Star! Black Star! You have to help me get my body back!”

Han Xiao’s mouth contorted slightly.

Why does it feel like I took away Evans’ screen time?

At this time, as usual, a notification popped up on the interface.

“A mission as expected...” Han Xiao started pondering.

The rewards of this mission were nothing extraordinary, but dealing with the Holy Accord organization seemed to be an opportunity to complete [Primal Esper Ability Collector].

If he had to find Primal Esper Ability Entities without owners, it would take God knew how long to find four. Now, however, he had met the Holy Accord organization, which professionally studied Esper Ability technology, so they definitely had some inventory. If he could snatch it, this milestone would be completed easily.

Han Xiao made his decision and responded.

“Alright then, I give you my word. However, they won’t be so easy to find.”

“It’s fine as long as you’re willing to help me.” The Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy was overjoyed.

Black Star was not his master and only saw him as a tool, so he had no right to ask for his help. Even without a part of his body, he would still be useful. Therefore, he had actually been quite afraid Han Xiao would not agree to help him.

Han Xiao comforted the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy for a while. Then, he took out a spare Mysterious Energy Host and stuffed it in, not giving it much time to recover from its psychological wounds.

This time, Ames looked around at the raging chaotic space streams around, frowned, and said, “The chaotic space streams these people released caused heavy damage to the Land of Dead Silence. If left alone, this secondary dimension might shatter before Hila comes in the future.”

Han Xiao looked around as well. The already broken space wall of the Land of Dead Silence had even more holes in it.

This secondary dimension was related to Hila, so the two of them could not leave it to shatter. Han Xiao summoned lots of space-related devices to stabilize the dimension.

The thickness of the space wall depended on the core energy of the secondary dimension. Only with enough energy would the space wall regenerate itself and continue to expand. The only thing Han Xiao could do now was guide the chaotic space streams that the Dimensional Exile Bullets created out and reduce the pollution.

This was a tough progress. The two of them spent quite some in the Land of Dead Silence before Han Xiao finally got rid of the chaotic space streams inside.

At this time, the two of them suddenly realized that the revive tokens they were wearing became hotter at an extremely quick pace.

At the same time, a golden light suddenly appeared on a shattered black island far away.

Han Xiao looked over and was slightly shocked.

An orange-gold silhouette suddenly appeared from the black desert. It looked like a spirit and had the appearance of a human female. Its clothes were exquisite. It looked charming, pretty, and rather young, but the look in its eyes gave a vibe that it was very old. It was looking at Han Xiao and Ames.

Seeing this, the two of them were both slightly surprised.

They had already scanned this entire secondary dimension when they arrived, and they were certain they did not sense any life form. Now, however, a strange silhouette had appeared out of thin air. It was clear it had avoided their detection.

Han Xiao was still on alert after the attack of the Holy Accord organization earlier. He was prepared to fight.

At this time, the revive token on the two of them shockingly started to float. This silhouetted pointed at the two revive tokens and sent a telepathic message.

“Tell me, what is the relationship between the two of you and the creator of these two coins?”

...

Inside the chaotic space streams, the Holy Accord organization’s fleet was floating.

Inside the command room, Law held the containment device up and observed the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy fragment. Unsatisfied, he sighed.

“Sigh, Black Star’s regenerative ability is too strong. These products given to us by the organization have very limited effects on him. Without enough time, this tiny bit of Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy is all we could get.”

“Be glad. At least the minimum requirements are met and the synthetic materials are all gathered. If we were too greedy and did not retreat instantly, our spaceship might have been taken by Black Star,” Fay said softly.

Although they had achieved the minimum goal of this mission, the two of them knew how close they were to being obliterated. They felt tremendous fear toward Han Xiao.

“This attack was a success, but it has made him cautious too. The next time we meet him, we won’t be able to achieve what we did today. Furthermore, he’ll most likely report the technology we displayed to the dynasty, which will bring some risks to the organization.” Law was worried.

Fay, however, was more optimistic. “Luckily, the mission was completed. It doesn’t matter if Black Star is cautious now. We won’t have to deal with him in the future again. There won’t be a next time.”

“You’re right.”

After chatting for a while, Law put the containment device away. Suddenly, he thought of something and said, “By the way, I seem to recall that the information about the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy shows that it’s the Holy Light Particle’s arch-enemy and that their energies conflict with each other. Maybe we can invent a special sensor through this characteristic it has to find the Holy Light Particle.”

“Hmm, you’re right. The Holy Light Particle has been missing for many years. God knows where it’s hiding. There are no clues about it at all. It’s also an important synthetic material, so the organization will probably heed your suggestion and target the Holy Light Particle next.”
