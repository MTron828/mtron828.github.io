Chapter 636 How Can One Draw a Prize Without Touching Feidin?

Han Xiao lowered his head and took a look at the battlefield from high above. The ground was cracked up like a biscuit that had been stepped on. There were still two gigantic craters and a dust cloud that had not subsided.

Han Xiao then flew back to ground and took the Void Dragon suit off.

Jayne and Gadeli immediately came forward to welcome him. Both of them were covered completely in dust with Jayne being covered with injuries all over.

“Black Star, did you get rid of that woman?” Jayne asked anxiously.

“No, she managed to escape.” Han Xiao shook his head.

“You were her target. Do you know who that woman

is?”

“I am not sure. This is the first time she’s attacked

me.”

Han Xiao knew that she was called Shana, but there was no need to let both of them know.

Both of them were truly furious. They had met a calamity that did not have anything to do with them, and all of their subordinates and battleship fleet had been wiped out.

However, it was useless for them to blame Black Star. Black Star was equally clueless and never intended to set them up. Besides, Black Star’s strength and status were things that they would not be able to compare to, so the two of them could only treat it as their own bad luck.

While Gadeli and Jayne were feeling extremely sh*tty, they were also extremely shocked at Shana’s combat capability. Even three Calamity Grade Supers were not enough to keep her behind. If not for Black Star’s timely burst of strength, both of them probably would not have been able to defeat the

enemy.

After the three of them adjusted their conditions a bit, Dodder sent an emergency communication request and asked about the situation.

“How are all of you? What happened just now?”

“An unfamiliar A+ Esper suddenly attacked us. Her identity is unknown...”

Han Xiao briefly explained what had happened and also asked the Purple Crystal Civilization to help him investigate the matter.

“No problem. We will thoroughly investigate the other party’s identity. We will inform you of our investigation results.” Dodder agreed to the request solemnly. “We are still in the midst of preparations for the alliance of organizations. There should be news within the year, and we will gather everyone when the time comes. I hope that the three of you will make appropriate preparations.”

After a short conversation, Dodder ended the transmission.

Han Xiao put his communicator away and looked at the two others. “What do the both of you intend to do after this?”

Both of them let out a bitter laughter.

“We are truly too unlucky.” Gadeli sighed.

“Start my recruitment and purchase battleships again to make up for today’s loss,” Jayne replied helplessly.

Upon hearing that, an idea immediately sprung up in Han Xiao’s mind. These two individuals were powerful Grade A Supers. With their organizations being crippled, he might have a chance to recruit them.

“Actually, both of you can come to my Black Star Army. With your strength, there won’t be a problem with you being vice commanders. I sincerely invite both of you to join me.”

Han Xiao smiled and extended his invitation.

The both of them were taken aback. After pondering for a moment, they gave their response.

“Thank you for your invitation, but I do not have any intention of joining another organization,” Jayne said.

“I still prefer to build my own organization. I’m sorry.” Gadeli shook his head.

“No worries. My invitation will always be open to both of you. We can talk about this again in detail whenever both of you are interested.”

Han Xiao was not too disappointed by the result.

It was far more difficult to recruit a Calamity Grade Super than a Grade B Super. Every Grade A Super had the strength and right to dominate a region, and their ambition would usually be in line with their strength. Gadeli and Jayne wanted to build their own organizations and were not willing to submit to others.

After all, even a beyond Grade A powerhouse might get rejected when trying to recruit a Calamity Grade Super.

“Black Star, we would like to trouble you with something.” Jayne was slightly embarrassed, and his chest hair shook.

“Feel free to speak.” Han Xiao tried his best not to get distracted by Jayne’s chest hair.

“Er... our spaceships were destroyed, so...”

Han Xiao chuckled and slapped Jayne on the shoulder. “Don’t worry, we are comrades who fought alongside each other. Take my spaceship. I’ll take both of you to the nearest port.”

“Haha, we shall trouble you then.”

Upon seeing that Black Star was such an easy going guy, Jayne stroked his chest hair happily. He belonged to a race that judged beauty based on their chest hair. Soft and silky chest hair was the benchmark of a suave man.

Han Xiao immediately forced a smile and said, “Please put on some clothes first... don’t drop any hair on my spaceship.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Shana’s spaceship was currently flying through the universe.

In the cockpit, Shana injected herself with some healing medicine and could barely walk properly. Only then did she send a transmission to her comrade.

Eliot appeared on the screen. He was Shana’s mage comrade, and both of them usually worked together.

The moment the transmission was connected, Eliot asked, “Shana, have you caught Black Star... Eh? Your complexion looks extremely terrible. Did something happen?”

“I failed.” Shana briefly described what had happened calmly.

“Hahaha. How miserable...”

Eliot did not display any anger but laughed out loud in schadenfreude instead.

Shana’s expression was ugly, and she hatefully said, “I will kill you one day.”

After laughing for a while, Eliot regained his cool and calmly said, “You acted rashly and failed your mission. You will cause us to face the risk of exposure. All of us will have to remain low profile for a period of time.”

Shana grunted and did not say anything. She did not attempt to find an excuse for her failure but did not feel guilty about it either. So what if she failed? It was not a big deal to her.

“Black Star’s strength has been underestimated,” Eliot said slowly. “While you did not reveal any information about us, he will now be wary, and it will be more difficult to capture him in the future. We should place him by the side temporarily and deal with the other targets.

“In any case, go back to headquarters and meet up with me there. We will discuss our plans back in the headquarters. Remember to shake off anyone following you, and do not reveal our location.”

“I don’t need you to remind me,” Shana replied coldly and hung up. She then activated the stealth function of her spaceship and traveled toward the headquarters.

However, she did not know that an eyeball was looking at her silently from the void.

After sending Gadeli and Jayne off, Han Xiao returned to the Garton Star System without stopping and stopped at the base on Planet Golden Gate.

The mercenaries in the surroundings saw the landing spaceship and recognized that this was Han Xiao’s personal spaceship. The Blacklight Stealth then flew straight into Han Xiao’s personal hangar, and he walked to the core region of the base through a priority tunnel. Without saying a word, he immediately went to find Feidin.

Feidin would usually be meditating on the rooftop on normal days. The moment Han Xiao came to the rooftop, he saw Feidin meditating cross legged with Psychic energy being emanated from his body.

Feidin’s eyes were shut at the moment as he sang melodiously. The path he took was identical to Chen Xing’s, and they used their Psychic energy through singing. The heavenly music was like elves within the winds to calm all fatigue and pain. Han Xiao also calmed down as he heard Feidin’s song.

Feidin’s song could cover the entire base and could give the players a temporary buff. This was the specialty of Planet Golden Gate, and Feidin was like the background music of the base.

Feidin had inherited all of Chen Xing’s knowledge and was an extremely talented individual himself. Thus, his strength improved at a rapid pace.

Two years ago, he could already suppress Chen Xing on his own but did not choose to leave. Instead, he chose to continue cultivating in the Black Star Army and occasionally follow the troops out on their missions.

Occasionally, he would travel alone to explore the galaxy but would always return to the Black Star Army to rest and reorganize. Han Xiao was extremely willing to be Feidin’s backer as long as he could touch Feidin.

Full marks for touching, zero marks for not touching

However, Feidin’s mission had not been completed yet. Ever since Feidin fulfilled his promise to hand over all of Chen Xing’s savings, his relationship with Chen Xing had entered a cold war period.

Han Xiao estimated that when two of them could open up their hearts to each other, a new world would be open to the both of them, and they would enter a phase of passionate love. That would also be the completion of his mission.

There was another person seated on the rooftop as well. Aroshia was seated by the side, enjoying Feidin’s singing. Two years ago, Han Xiao had shared the mission to find Aroshia’s memories with the players, and the effect over the two years was obvious. The mission progress had accumulated quickly and was about to be complete. Aroshia enjoyed listening to Feidin sing as it could allow her to recall more memories.

When she saw Han Xiao arriving, Aroshia transformed her arm into energy and wrapped it around Han Xiao’s waist like a belt as a greeting.

Noticing Han Xiao’s footsteps, Feidin stopped singing and turned around. With a smile, he said, “Black Star, are you looking for me for something?”

“Nothing much. You can continue singing. I am only here to find some luck.”

Han Xiao then walked forward and touched Feidin all over before turning around to take his leave.

Feidin touched his nose and laughed bitterly.

He had always felt that Black Star had somehow misunderstood him. Was his luck very good? Why did he not hear about it?

After Han Xiao touched Feidin to his heart’s content, he left the rooftop and opened the interface. Before his luck could dissipate, he hurriedly concluded the [Prey) mission to draw for Shana’s ability.

First round complete.

You have received: the opportunity to draw one of Shana’s abilities or talents.

Note: Shana is a unique Esper, and the abilities that you draw will be adjusted based on your class.

Randomizing... draw complete.

Please select one of the five rewards:

[Magnetic Field Vision) – talent: You will gain a keen insight into magnetic fields. +12% Machinery Affinity, +6% Mechanical Force bonus range

[Magnetic Vortex] – skill: Control skill. Release a burst of magnetic energy to create a magnetic field. Chance to inflict a target within the magnetic field with the (Chaos) status. Chance determined by INT and external environment. Energy Usage: 160, Cooldown: 46s

[Electromagnetic Shooting Stars] – skill: Long ranged skill. Overlay multiple objects with electromagnetic force. Accumulate a large amount of kinetic energy before shooting the objects out and causing a damage between 210 – 742. Damage determined by the size of object and accumulated electromagnetic time. Energy Usage: 75, Cooldown: 12s.

(Strong Magnetic Field Shield] – skill: Defensive skill. A magnetic shield will be formed within a 3m vicinity of the user. Shield durability is unlimited, and maintaining the shield will exhaust energy. If the damage taken by the shield within a second exceeds the critical point, the magnetic shield will be shattered. Cooldown 2.5s. The critical point is determined by the amount of energy exhausted per second with the maximum damage being 22,000. Every time the shield takes damage, additional energy will be exhausted.

(Super Electromagnetic Sense] – talent: Your ‘magnetic’ attribute will be enhanced. The bonus received from every energy level will change.

This was the result after the skills had been modified, and Han Xiao was not too surprised. All of Shana’s skills were rooted in her Esper ability, and it was impossible for him to gain the other party’s Esper ability. The abilities to strengthen the control of metal in a magnetic field would be useless to him.

Thankfully, control of metal within a magnetic field was extremely compatible with the Mechanic class. After a series of adjustments, most of the skills were useful to Mechanics as well.

There was not a single skill that stood out from the rest, but the skills were not too terrible either. Han Xiao felt that he had drawn the average skills this time.

If I didn’t touch Feidin, I am afraid that I would have drawn some sh*tty skills. It seems like Feidin’s luck cancelled out my bad luck.
