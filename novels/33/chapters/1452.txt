Chapter 1453 What? The World Tree Called?!

“What? Black Star and the three Universal Civilizations have privately agreed to open the Sanctum?!”

The surprised voice of the leader of the Star Arc sounded in the conference room of the Super Star Cluster Alliance. A civilization leader nodded with a solemn expression. “I received some news. Black Star seems to have really shared the Sanctum information with the three Universal Civilizations.”

“Is the news accurate?” The Star Arc Leader’s expression turned solemn.

“Very reliable.”

Hearing this, the expressions of all the Super Star Cluster leaders changed.

The three Universal Civilizations did not cover up Black Star’s actions of sharing the Sanctum. This was not a secret that no one could not find out, but they did not disclose it to the outside world either. After knowing about their current situation, they did not have such thoughts for the time being. If not, they would have advertised it in the past to increase their reputation.

The composition of the three Sanctum keys that Han Xiao had given them, as well as the method of entering the Sanctum, were the three Universal Civilizations’ top-secret information. Outsiders would not be able to find out about it, so the Super Star Cluster Alliance only knew about the appearance of the two sides cooperating to open the Sanctum. They did not know the exact reason and details.

“This is really strange. Now, the three Universal Civilizations, the Supers Holy Land, and we are already in a tripartite situation. The Sanctum is the core strength of the Supers Holy Land. Isn’t Black Star helping the enemy? What does he mean by this?”

The leader was confused. “Indeed, I don’t understand either. Why does Black Star need to share the Sanctuary with the three Universal Civilizations?” Another civilization leader was puzzled. “In the past, when Beyond Grade As still existed as organizations, they did not share the Sanctum’s information even when facing the suppression of the three Universal Civilizations. Now, the Supers Holy Land is already a huge force, comparable to the three Universal Civilizations. Why did they give out the Sanctum’s information instead? Could it be that some chip has fallen into the hands of the three Universal Civilizations?” “I feel that it’s impossible for Black Star to be threatened by the three Universal Civilizations. There must be other reasons. Black Star might have other plans... We can’t even rule out the possibility of them forming deep strategic cooperation.”

“The World Tree has already been dealt with, what other strategic cooperation can they have? Could it be that they are fighting that third-party infiltrator? But is there a need for that? Both the three Universal Civilizations and Black Star can deal with the Star Alliance alone.”

At this moment, one of the leaders hesitated for a moment and said carefully,

“...Have you ever thought that they might be working together against us?”

The room fell silent.

After a long time, the leader of the Star Arc swallowed his saliva and said, “Um... I don’t think that’s possible. We’re lubricants between them. They probably won’t gang up on us...”

“I don’t think so...” Someone was worriedly singing the opposite tune.” Could it be that our attitude of waiting for a good price was too blatant and angered both sides?”

Hearing that, everyone panicked. After the structure of the war was established, they would circle around the three Universal Civilizations and the Supers Holy Land, jumping around to maintain balance. According to their initial analysis, the three Universal Civilizations needed to form an alliance with them to suppress the Supers Holy Land. Therefore, they would definitely ‘change their ways’ and use a lot of benefits to rope them in. This was also the case in the early stages. Finally, they were no longer suppressed and had the space to develop freely. Using a different method, they achieved what they initially wanted to achieve through migration. Logically speaking, if not for the rise of the Supers Holy Land, the Super Star Cluster would not have been able to do as they wished. Black Star had contributed to this, but because of the balance, they could not stay as close as they wanted to the Supers Holy Land. Otherwise, the three Universal Civilizations would definitely explode. Thus, they could only temporarily put aside the alliance agreement with Black Star and turn it into superficial cooperation.

The Supers Holy Land did not say anything about this. The Super Star Cluster Alliance had even specially called Black Star to apologize, and the other party did not seem to mind. Thus, the Super Star Cluster alliance had always been at ease and felt that this route was not a problem. They hoped to maintain a good cooperative relationship with both sides... But now that Black Star and the three Universal Civilizations had played such a card, they immediately felt uncertain.

It felt as if there were two enemies who were not on good terms with each other, and he had maintained a good relationship with both of them. Like a sticker for the three of them, he let everyone play together. However, one day, the two enemies suddenly made up for no reason. They put their arms around each other’s shoulders and did not bring him along to play. Instead, he became the third person, isolated. This was very uncomfortable.

“I think we need to analyze it, but we can’t rule out the possibility that such a factor is involved. We need to consider our attitude towards the Supers Holy Land and the three Universal Civilizations. We can’t be too cold,” the leader of the Star Arc said with a heavy tone.

The higher-ups of the Super Star Cluster felt their hearts turn weak the more they thought about it. They were too suspicious and scared themselves.

In the unexplored universe, Star Alliance capital. “Ever since the World Tree fully invaded, the three Universal Civilizations have been in an increasingly difficult situation. In the past two years, they have lost almost six percent of their territory. I thought that they would be able to hold on for a few decades, but it seems like I’ve overestimated them. The three Universal Civilizations will not be able to withstand the attack of the World Tree at all. At this rate, the three Universal Civilizations will definitely be defeated in five to six years, the longest in thirteen to fourteen years!”

In the meeting room, the leader of the Star Alliance and the leaders of the various civilizations had smiles on their faces. The room was filled with happiness.

For more than a year since the World Tree invaded the interstellar society, they had been living a very happy life. Even their footsteps were light. Every time they read the “battle report” sent by the spies, they would look forward to the next episode because they were always full of surprises.

The leader of the Star Alliance knocked on the table and said with a smile, “Over the past year, the three Universal Civilizations were almost completely defeated by the World Tree. Black Star was heavily injured by the ambush and had exceeded the limits of his Indestructible Body. He had no choice but to fall into a deep sleep and slowly recuperate. Thus, the Sanctum Revival was temporarily terminated. The intel says that he is now the spiritual pillar of the galactic society to resist the external enemies. Once Black Star falls, the morale of the Galactic Alliance Army will collapse, and they will be forced to retreat on the battlefield... Therefore, it is obvious that without Black Star, the galactic allied forces are just a motley crew.”

“Hehe, not bad, not bad.” The leader of the Lore Civilization, Savignes, chuckled. “Furthermore, the reports from the first two episodes said that the mother planets of the three Universal Civilizations were attacked frequently and had no choice but to let many of the upper echelons take refuge. During the voyage, the Crimson Dynasty’s spaceship was ambushed on a large scale, and the current leader, Marbruce, was cut in half at the waist, dying without a complete corpse. The previous Dynasty Ruler, Urranrell, was captured by the members of the World Tree, and it was said that the pillar of the nation, Clotti, went alone to save her. In the end, he was captured, but his will was firm. Thus, the World Tree gathered the members and violated Urranrell repeatedly in front of him, destroying Clotti’s will before the World Tree devoured him and turned him into a slave...”

“Speaking of which, the peak Beyond Grade As of the galactic society either died or were injured. Manison’s true body was exposed, and he was turned into a slave by the World Tree. All of his assets were used to support the enemy. Kasuyi’s mind was shattered, and he became a fool. Wuornos was forced to participate in the battle, and the Church’s National Treasure was almost shattered...”

These battle reports were all fabricated by Han Xiao’s order to the lurkers who had already jumped out of hiding. He even added quite a number of personal gossips into them, which made it quite “exciting”. As for the people involved in the battle report, they did not know that Han Xiao was making things up about them.

The members of the Star Alliance talked about the good news in the previous war reports with great interest. They wanted to see the suffering of the people of the galactic society and laugh. After chatting for a while, the leader of the Star Alliance calmed down and knocked on the table.

“Although the defeat of the three Universal Civilizations is set in stone, and we have finally gotten rid of a huge threat, the World Tree is a new threat. When the war ends, we still need to pay attention to the World Tree.”

“That’s right. The failure of the three Universal Civilizations has proven how terrifying they are. Even if we reach the height of the three Universal Civilizations, we still won’t be their match.”

“Yeah, but time stands with us. As long as we keep developing, sooner or later—”.

The leader of the Star Alliance was about to look forward to the future to cheer everyone on when the meeting room was suddenly pushed open.

Bang!

A secretary rushed in anxiously with an anxious look on his face. His eyes were filled with fear.

“Leaders, something bad has happened. We found traces of the World Tree army. The World Tree is attacking!”

“What?!”

Crash

The expressions of all the Star Alliance’s upper echelons changed drastically as they stood up!
