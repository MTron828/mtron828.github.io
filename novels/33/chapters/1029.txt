Chapter 1030 Movements of the Competitors

‚ÄúThey want me to snatch that famous Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy on the dynasty‚Äôs behalf?‚Äù

In a certain dynasty‚Äôs ally stronghold in the Flickering World‚Äôs free competition zone, Ravenlaude was surprised to receive this message from the upper echelons of the dynasty.

As a member of the senior celebrity group, Ravenlaude was quite highly regarded among the Beyond Grade A allies of the dynasty. His position was far above people like Kohler or Beyoni. Although he did not exactly have a good relationship with Black Star, the two of them held no grudges against each other.

Of course, Ravenlaude had no idea that the Spacetime Amber was supposed to belong to him but was taken away by Han Xiao in advance, or he would have joined the ‚Äòdynasty anti-Black Star alliance‚Äô, which had Heber as its one and only member.

It was common for the dynasty to ask him for help. What Ravenlaude was surprised about was the information about the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy appearing. This was the first time he had heard of this.

‚ÄúThe Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy...‚Äù Ravenlaude‚Äôs eyes sparkled.

To be honest, he was quite tempted.

Primal Esper Abilities in the Super High Risk Esper Ability List such as this one were extremely rare. If he could make it his, it would be more than enough to raise a powerful subordinate, or he could use sealing type spells to seal the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy onto special magic puppets to use its powers, which might make the puppet as strong as a Universal Treasure.

However, these greedy thoughts only existed for a few seconds in Ravenlaude‚Äôs mind before he completely extinguished them.

His organization was right in the Constellation Corridor, which was heavily affected by the dynasty. There was no need to go against the dynasty‚Äôs will for just a Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy.

The dynasty told him about this information to let him help, but if he was tempted by it, it would definitely upset the dynasty. To him, there was more to lose than gain.

‚ÄúBut a Universal Treasure...‚Äù

Ravenlaude still found it tough to let go. It was not really because he did not even have the courage to let go of the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy, but after seeing Han Xiao‚Äôs Spacetime Amber, he had felt a sense of emptiness in his heart, like he had missed something very important. Universal Treasures had become almost an impulse for him.

It was like a kid seeing the other kids with fun toys and also wanting one.

One word, jealous!

‚ÄúSince the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy is as valuable as a Universal Treasure, it‚Äôs the right time to negotiate terms with the dynasty.‚Äù

Ravenlaude then gave his request to the dynasty‚Äîif they wanted his help, the dynasty had to grant him a Universal Treasure from their inventory.

Not long after his request, the dynasty‚Äôs reply came, expressing their approval of Ravenlaude‚Äôs request but with additional terms.

If the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy appeared in other areas, Ravenlaude would only receive some resources as a reward for his trouble.

But if the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy appeared in the Emerald Star Cluster and Ravenlaude obtained it, he would be allowed to pick one Universal Treasure from the dynasty‚Äôs inventory. V·ªãSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)cùíêm for new ùíèovùíÜlùíî

A list was also attached with the reply with the Universal Treasures the dynasty allowed Ravenlaude to claim. Most of them were combat equipment; it was the same list given to Han Xiao in exchange for the Evolution Cube.

Ravenlaude browsed through carefully and nodded with satisfaction.

Han Xiao had no interest in these things, but they were very valuable to Ravenlaude. After all, Han Xiao already had the Evolution Cube and the Spacetime Amber, so ordinary Universal Treasures could not meet his standards.

With the reward promised, Ravenlaude became motivated about this mission. After carefully looking at the list of competitors that the dynasty had provided, he smiled with confidence.

How hard would it be to snatch something from a bunch of weaklings?

...

In an unexplored area of the Emerald Star Cluster, a fleet was moving in hyperdrive. Its exterior armor had no symbols.

Inside the main ship, a tall man wearing a purple rope stood before the command console, giving off a cold aura and silently looking at the star map. The red dots on it marked the coordinates where the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy might appear.

Beside him, a fishman-like creature who was restrained by magical ropes said with a shivering and nervous tone, ‚ÄúYour Excellency Secret Master, I swear this piece of intelligence is real. It‚Äôs really EsGod‚Äôs heritage, not fake news I made up!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt had better be, or you know the consequences,‚Äù a cold and indifferent voice replied. The man turned around and glanced at him. All of the skin he was showing was covered in magnificent and complicated magical runes flickering with dim light, like he was a tattoo addicted.

Just like ‚ÄòBeast Ancestor‚Äô Gorutan, this man was also a protector of the Galactic Black Market. He was the famous Secret Master renowned in the magic society. He was an authority in Rune Studies, Alchemy Studies, and Secret Studies, especially in Secret Studies. The reason he had this nickname was because there was a rumor going around that he had mastered a type of spell that could control someone‚Äôs ‚Äòluck‚Äô, also that he was a master in fortune telling and foresight.

All the tattoos on his body were Forbidden Spell grade rune enchantments that provided powerful enhancements to his body. The organization that Secret Master was in specialized in extremely advanced rune technology, which could be seen from looking at his subordinates. All of them were wearing exquisite rune armor, and the skin they were showing was also covered in complex magical patterns.

Secret Master turned to the star map, and the cold look in his eyes rippled ever so slightly.

‚ÄúThe Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy...‚Äù

Not long ago, he had suddenly foreseen that a huge event would happen in the Emerald Star Cluster that might be beneficial to him, so he had used his power in the black market and investigated it. With his outstanding luck, he discovered a small organization that had fought for EsGod‚Äôs heritage previously. They happened to have the coordinates of the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy. After they were captured and interrogated, Secret Master developed an interest for the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy.

He was someone who did not mind using all kinds of external agents to increase his strength, and all these runes over his body were proof of that. At the same time, he had plenty of high-quality magic items; his desire to collect rare items was almost at an OCD level. Therefore, he naturally wanted this extremely rare Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy as well.

Due to the distance, he had sent officers to the other coordinates while he headed personally to the Emerald Star Cluster as it had the highest possibility.

‚ÄúI wonder what organizations will be part of this...‚Äù

This question appeared in his mind but was very soon forgotten. He had a lot of confidence.

No matter what organization comes, I‚Äôll just have to beat them up. How many of them will be able to stand up to a Beyond Grade A like me?

...

The stronghold of the Modo Civilization was situated in another area of the Emerald Star Cluster.

An elite team formed by Calamity Grade Supers gathered at a secret dock, and the commander of the Modo Civilization‚Äôs Expedition Fleet Roddick and the inspector Lagos stood before them, examining the team.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll leave the mission of the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy to you guys.‚Äù Roddick nodded at everyone solemnly.

Some advanced civilizations had also received information from EsGod‚Äôs heritage, among which the Modo Civilization was one of those who knew about the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy. The Modo Civilization had no reason to let go of something this valuable.

The other locations were given to others to take care of, while the Expedition Fleet led by Roddick was responsible for the coordinates in the Emerald Star Cluster.

Ever since the Expedition Fleet was last attacked by the ‚Äòmysterious force‚Äô, pressured by the upper echelons, Roddick had become much more vigilant. He was very careful in resupplying the resources.

However, it did not turn out to be very useful. The reinforcements redeployed from the Shattered Star Ring were often attacked by ‚Äòunknown forces‚Äô on the way, which cost them a lot of time.

Luckily, after they arrived in the free competition zone, the Super Star Cluster allies had helped them slightly, which made the situation better for the Modo Civilization. Therefore, Roddick‚Äôs team were not attacked again in the Emerald Star Cluster.

Hence, he had the time to gather an elite team, ready to complete the mission given by the upper echelons‚Äîcapture the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy.

Super Star Cluster civilizations had vast territories and rich resources, as well as plenty of high level combatants. They had thousands of Calamity Grades, far more than those Star System civilizations that only had a few dozens.

The Modo Civilization had high hopes for the Expedition Fleet, so they had deployed around a hundred Calamity Grades. This elite team that would be heading to capture the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy included forty percent of the Expedition Fleet‚Äôs Calamity Grade officers, which was about forty to fifty of them. This was a powerful armed force.

For this operation, the Modo Civilization did not notify the other allies of the Super Star Cluster alliance. After all, there was only one Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy; it could not be shared.

Maybe the other civilizations had this intelligence too, but the Modo Civilization clearly was not going to tell others about it.

Watching the fleet enter stealth mode and leave, Lagos came to Roddick and asked in a worried tone, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it too risky to send this many people? If something happens, we‚Äôll lose a large number of elites. Calamity Grades are difficult to raise...‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve told them to be careful. If any Beyond Grade As participate, they‚Äôll act cautiously. If not, they can crush any and all competing organizations,‚Äù Roddick said with a deep voice.

‚ÄúBut now that we‚Äôve sent them out, the defenses of our stronghold will be weak. Aren‚Äôt you worried that Blac... the mysterious force will attack us again?‚Äù Lagos asked.

Roddick snorted and said in a firm tone, ‚ÄúHumph, the strongholds of the Super Star Cluster alliance look over each other‚Äôs shoulders. We even hired some Beyond Grade As, who are all more reliable than Garoze. So what if Black Star‚Äôs forces are strong? He won‚Äôt dare come and touch us.‚Äù

They did not have to advance anymore. Back then, they had no help, so there was nothing they could do when they were attacked. Now, however, all their teammates had gathered, and the lines of defenses were stronger than ever. If Black Star caused trouble, he would have to face the entire Super Star Cluster alliance. He did not think Black Star would dare do that.

...

After the Flickering World opened, Psyker did not give up on the opportunity and also followed the Arcane Church in to develop his forces and built a stronghold in the free competition zone.

As the three Universal Civilizations were coexisting there, Psyker did not get targeted, so his days were quite peaceful. Looking at the exploration fleet doing better work every day, he was rather content.

‚ÄúI shall see how things go first. If I can stabilize my territory in the Flickering World, I can migrate a portion of my people here and have them live here as a branch of the race.‚Äù

At the top of the base, Psyker looked up at the sky and thought about his migration plan.

At this time, an officer hastily walked over.

‚ÄúLeader, the base‚Äôs radar has discovered two fleets closing in. They seem to be in combat. One side only has three battleships left, and they cannot hang on much longer. According to the direction they‚Äôre heading, their battle will very soon reach our stronghold. What should we do?‚Äù

Psyker used his seven eyes to look at the radar images and ordered, ‚ÄúChase them away. Tell them to not fight around my territory.‚Äù

As the order was given, the subordinates quickly executed it. However, after some time, this officer ran back hastily again.

‚ÄúLeader, they have already been chased away, but that group of people we saved aren‚Äôt willing to leave. One of them is a Calamity Grade Super. He thinks that you saved them, so he wants to join us with his team.‚Äù

‚ÄúJoin us?‚Äù Psyker was a little stunned. He felt a complicated emotion in his heart.

He suddenly remembered that ever since he was targeted by Black Star, it had been a very long time since anyone came to join his forces. He had almost forgotten what it was like to be a Beyond Grade A.

This long-lost feeling... was so comforting.

‚ÄúInvite him here. I want to see him.‚Äù Psyker was glad, and his attitude became much friendlier. Psyker decided to see him personally to show him that he took him seriously.

After some time, this Calamity Grade was brought before Psyker. He had many wounds on his body, and it was clear he had just come from a tough battle.

‚ÄúYour Excellency Star Pupil.‚Äù This person‚Äôs face was filled with appreciation. He ignored the pain in his body and bowed with admiration. ‚ÄúYou saved my life. I‚Äôm willing to join your forces and work for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm, it‚Äôs a small matter.‚Äù Psyker looked calmed on the surface, but he actually liked this a lot. The respectful attitude from this person made him remember what it was like to be a Beyond Grade A again.

‚ÄúTo repay you, I would like to give you a gift. It‚Äôs a piece of valuable intelligence.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat intelligence?‚Äù Psyker asked.

‚ÄúA clue about that legendary Super High Risk Esper Ability, the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy!‚Äù

Psyker paused for a second, and interest flashed through his seven eyes at the same time.

...

In Black Star Palace...

‚ÄúWhat, he invited me over, but he went out‚ÄΩ‚Äù

Ames narrowed her eyes. The temperature in the room seemed to decrease by a hundred degrees in an instant. A powerful force field roared like tides. The floor and the walls made of high strength alloys vibrated nonstop while making squeaking noises, and cracks appeared very quickly.

Aurora‚Äôs legs were going soft. She lowered her head with a sense of guilt.

My teacher is... so scary when she‚Äôs angry.

She could feel Ames‚Äô anger just from this powerful force field.

She had accepted the invitation with excitement, travelled all that way, only to discover that Han Xiao was not even there. Anyone would be angry because of that...

No, it was even worse. Han Xiao was not home, yet he had called her over. It was almost like a deliberate prank.

Even someone as carefree as Ames felt that she had been toyed with.

‚ÄúTeacher, why not stay here for some time? Uncle will come back,‚Äù Aurora said cautiously.

Ames glanced at her and rebutted subconsciously, ‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm that free?‚Äù

Then, both of them fell silent.

Aurora wanted to say something but did not.

Don‚Äôt you know exactly whether you‚Äôre very free or not?

The two of them looked into each other‚Äôs eyes, and the atmosphere gradually turned awkward.

After looking at each other for a few moments, Ames suddenly retracted the roaring force field. Without changing her expression, she purposely used a tone that sounded like she did not care and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll stay for some time then. I‚Äôm mainly here for you anyway. Whether Black Star is here or not, I don‚Äôt care. In fact, it bothers me to see his face. It‚Äôs best that he‚Äôs not here.

Aurora remained silent. Sure, I believe you.
