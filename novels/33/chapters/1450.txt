Chapter 1451 Speculation and Conjecture

The three of them took a while to digest the information that Han Xiao had given them.

Louis hesitated.

“Black Star, are you trying to trick us...”

“Unfortunately, not this time.” Han Xiao shrugged.

Marbruce had a strange expression on his face. “In other words, we are all people who died and reincarnated a few times. This is equivalent to being trapped in a sealed secondary dimension. Our final goal is to break through this secondary dimension and return to the main universe?” “Hmm, although the difference is quite big you can understand it that way.” Han Xiao blinked.

“It means that everything our civilization has experienced from the beginning is a predestined development trajectory. It has already happened a few times, and it was ‘personally’ built by us?”

“Something like that.” Han Xiao nodded.

“Let me recover...”

The Pope pressed his forehead and felt his blood pressure rising.

All of a sudden, the three of them felt as though the values that they had formed in their lives had been shattered. In the face of such a situation, they realized that all the political and military problems that they usually considered became insignificant.

“So, we’re that powerful...”

Marbruce was still in shock. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Han Xiao ruthlessly interrupted his imagination. “It’s not that you guys are strong, but the final three Universal Civilizations are. Compared to the ‘you’ of the past, you guys are like three little brothers. Don’t flatter the three Universal Civilizations of now. Without me, you guys would still not have known anything.”

The three of them felt a little hurt.

Although this is the truth, can’t you let us indulge a little?

However, no matter what, the three of them still felt like they had been blessed by their ancestors after learning about these secrets.

“Black Star, you really gave us a scare...” Marbruce smiled bitterly.” My mind is in a mess right now. I don’t even know what to do.

Han Xiao raised his brows and joked, “Didn’t you say you’ve seen all kinds of storms? Have you seen this before?”

“Ahem, I think we should talk about how to break the seal of the dark side universe and return to the true universe...”

The Pope’s face darkened, and he quickly changed the topic, not wanting to admit that he was too careless.

However, Han Xiao did not give a direct answer. Instead, he slowly said,

“I know you guys still have some doubts in your hearts, thinking that I made this up. When you guys enter the Sanctum and confirm that the information I’m talking about is correct, we’ll talk about what to do next... By the way, let me remind you guys, the Sanctum requires authorization to access the Iteration messages. You guys will only know the basic information when you enter the Sanctum for the first time, which is information like Iteration and Great Reboot. As for information like dark side Iteration and continuous reboot, you guys won’t be able to see it for the time being. I only learned about these things after completely unlocking the authorization.” “Oh, so it was like that...”

The three of them had not witnessed the functions of the Sanctum with their own eyes, so they could only listen to Han Xiao’s explanation. However, they believed most of it, because there was no need for Black Star to lie to them about something that could be so easily verified.

However, Marbruce and the other two felt an itch in their hearts. This feeling was like watching a suspense movie. They had only seen the beginning, but Black Star knew all the details and did not tell them who the killer was. This made them very curious. However, the three of them did have some concerns, and they did not dare completely believe what Han Xiao said. They would only be at ease if they entered the Sanctum to take a look.

“I will send you the method to enter the Sanctum in a while. Also, I will give you three more sets of Sanctum keys. You can enter by yourselves, lest you say that I did something.”

Han Xiao said casually.

He was the only one who could quickly create the Sanctum Keys. Even the three Universal Civilizations, which had plenty of resources, needed time to collect materials. Therefore, without his help, the three Universal Civilizations could not enter the Sanctum frequently. This was also the reason why he had the confidence to control the Sanctum and did not mind letting the three Universal Civilizations enter the Sanctum.

“That is the best.”

The three of them hurriedly nodded like obedient children.

“Alright, then you guys digest the truth of the universe and Iterations. I won’t disturb you guys any longer. I’ll send you the materials later.”

Han Xiao nodded and hung up.

The remote projection disappeared, and the three of them looked at each other with different expressions.

“I didn’t expect Black Star to bring such intelligence... If what he said is true, then our future plans will have to be reorganized.”

“That’s right. If the situation is true, then there’s no point in us developing peacefully here. We have to break through fate and fulfill the wishes of our past lives, entering the so-called true universe.”

“Let’s not talk about this for now. Let’s start from the beginning...”

The three of them gathered their heads together and started discussing.

Supers Holy Land, Leader’s Office.

Han Xiao’s eyes flashed, and he returned to his room. Complicated emotions appeared in his eyes.

He had pretended to be confident and calm in front of the three Universal Civilizations. In fact, when he found out about the truth from the Sanctum, he was also shocked, but it also solved many of his doubts.

In fact, Han Xiao still had many of his own secrets that he had not told the heads of the three Universal Civilizations just now. For example, the existence of the interface meant that there were three possibilities.

The first was that the interface was a special product formed when the true state of the true universe was transformed into the Information Form state of the dark side universe. It was like when a high-dimensional object descended into a low dimension, it had a special advantage. It was like how a piece of paper hid no secrets to humans, providing information that low-dimensional objects could not contain. The second possibility was that it was the product of Information Form mutation.

The third guess was that the three Universal Civilizations of the second dark side Iteration had projected the ‘information cluster’ of the dark side universe into the true universe through ‘login’, and the interface was the necessary medium to complete this step. It could be considered a special ‘retractor’ or ‘recorder’. Therefore, it might have been specially created by the three Universal Civilizations to ensure that the True State would remain in the dark side universe for a long time.

However, no matter which one it was, the interface was something unique to the dark side universe and could not enter the true universe. The evidence that made Han Xiao speculate this was that when he entered the Sanctum, the interface would disappear. Because the Sanctum did not only exist in the dark side universe, the interface lost its effect.

As for his ‘special’ interface, Han Xiao had a guess.

In his opinion, this was either because the three Universal Civilizations of the third dark side Iteration wanted to build a stable interference bridge and deliberately created life support for the ‘Information Form Individual’ who had completely entered the dark side universe, ensuring that he could live ‘stably’ in the dark side universe and reduce the chances of him dying due to various accidents, or it was the result of the Information Form mutation on the normal interface in the dark side Iteration.

According to the various performances of the interface, Han Xiao was more inclined toward the former. When the interface triggered a mission, more information would usually be revealed in the mission introduction. Because the development trajectory of the dark universe was almost fixed, the three Universal Civilizations of the third dark side Iteration could modify the interface into something similar to a ‘Prophet’. Of course, this did not exclude the fact that their interface had the hidden principle of monitoring the entire dark universe.

In addition, when the players went online (the True States Interference), he would be able to enter the players’ forums through the interface and spy on the communication between the ‘True States’. During the version update period, the forums were also frozen for him. From this perspective, the special interface on him was indeed like an important medium and channel to communicate with the True States.

This reminded Han Xiao of the two Information Form threads he had seen on the interface when he used the Information Form Obliteration vision. One was connected to him, while the other extended infinitely. Now that he thought about it, the connection on this end probably represented the entire dark side universe. This seemed to support the idea.

On the other hand, Han Xiao also speculated about the theory behind the flow of time in the version update. In the mainstream scientific theories of the Galaxy, time was relative, not absolute. From this point of view, based on the content of the message board in the Sanctum, he felt that the time of the dark universe and the true universe did not have any connection, only the difference in relative speed.

The true universe was the foundation of the third Iteration. The dark side universe had to depend on it to exist, but the relative time flow of the dark side universe was faster and went through reboots again and again without affecting the other side. However, when the players came online and caused the dark side universe and the true universe to become entangled in Information Form, the flow of time between the two sides was locked. The time flow of the dark side universe and the true universe passed at a stable ratio, which was one to six... The reason behind this was that the true universe still occupied the dominant position, and the players whose ‘foundation’ existed in the true universe would not be affected.

When the True State of the players’ temporary logins disappeared, the level of Information Form interference plummeted, and the flow of time in the dark side universe would be disconnected from the true universe... This conjecture showed that the version update would only take one or two days for the players while many years would have passed in the Galaxy World. Han Xiao felt that this was quite possible. He even suspected that starting from the second dark side Iteration, the frequency of the Information Form mutation in the dark side universe was very likely the change brought about by the third dark side Iteration’s introduction of the True States... If the true universe and Sanctum were seen as existences of a higher dimension, then the projected projection would produce distortions, and a ‘surreal’ phenomenon would occur, causing the third dark side Iteration’s Information Form Materialization device to become the World Tree, and the fourth dark side Iteration’s control terminal to become the Pivotal Snake.

“Other than this reason, perhaps the dark side universe is the same as the Celestial Star Alliance Dimension. Only an external Information Form carrier can greatly change its development trajectory, bringing new variables and accidents... Even if the dark side universe is not a rigid cycle, such variables might still be needed.”

Han Xiao’s expression changed.

Although many of these theories were speculations based on the truth revealed by the Sanctum messages, he felt that they were very likely.

“Even if this is a relay across Iterations, every civilization wants to be the last one. As long as there’s a glimmer of hope, every civilization wants to continue surviving, and no one wants to go extinct. It’s understandable for the three Universal Civilizations to do this, but...”

Han Xiao shook his head with mixed feelings.

If all his deductions were correct, then he would be the hope of the entire dark side universe...

But to him, this was a multiple-choice question.
