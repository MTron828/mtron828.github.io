Chapter 499: Battle of Noriosse (5)

The next instant, a terrifying might that shook the three Calamity Grade Supers descended and launched toward Anur.

“What‽” Anur’s expression changed drastically.

Boom!

The speeding Anur was stopped instantly without any form of retaliation. The surrounding atmosphere seemed to have been frozen in space and Anur was like a bug trapped in amber, completely unable to move.

Anur has fallen into [Trapped] status for 14 seconds.

How is this possible‽

Being caught completely off guard, Anur was thoroughly shocked.

Such a frightening restriction ability. Could it be the Dragon Emperor’s strength‽

While it’s true that Black Star is the Dragon Emperor’s subordinate, why is he able to use the Dragon Emperor’s strength‽

Anur had not felt panic for a very long time. At that moment, his calmness was completely destroyed. No matter how much he tried, he could not move an inch or say a single word. Looking at Nagakin, who was charging over blazing brightly, fear could finally be seen in his eyes.

Bang!

As though a golden bolt of lightning had been smashed into his chest, Anur’s weak wind pressure shield was shattered, and the sound of Nagakin’s fists smashing into Anur’s body sounded like thunder in the clear sky.

Nagakin had been accumulating the force of this strike for a long time, and its might could shake the mountain and blow cities away. Those fists of his were sufficient to destroy an entire district. However, Anur’s body was fixed in place, and he could not fly out anywhere. The entire force of the attack could only be borne by his body.

A mouthful of blood was spat into the violent winds!

Bang bang bang!

Nagakin let out a roar and unleashed all of his frustrations. An endless afterimage of fists and kicks could be seen and every single attack of his hit Anur squarely in the chest. Anur was like a living target board who could not move. He had no choice but to endure the storm like attacks with his body’s shape being visibly contorted!

“Too violent.” Han Xiao’s brows twitched as he watched the scene. At the same time, he could hardly resist the temptation to add in some sound effects to complement the show. However, Han Xiao did not remain idle and raised his High Frequency Strike Cannon to attack as well.

This is a rare opportunity! The higher the damage, the better!

The two of them trapped Anur in the middle and gave him a good serving of their attacks.

Without the wind pressure shield, Anur could only endure the attacks with his physical body and was beaten up to the point his bones were shattered and his flesh was mashed up.

His broken bones protruded out from his skin, and blood gushed out like a fountain!

The Protector did not have time to even be shocked. His mission was to stop both parties from being killed, and Anur was also one of his protection targets. Previously, he did not think that there would be a need for him to help Anur, but the situation suddenly changed, and the target that he had to protect was Anur.

However, Anur had released a wind pressure cannon to delay the Protector’s footsteps right before he was restricted and caused the Protector to be unable to save Black Star in time.

Fourteen seconds of crazed attacks. When the control time ended, all the accumulated force from Anur’s body exploded forth. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Boom!

A bloody firework went off in midair!

An Esper who was not able to use his abilities would be far more vulnerable. For example, a defensive Esper might be able to block a nuclear explosion with their shield, but they would not be able to block a nuclear explosion with their own body. Anur did not specialize in defense, and by restricting his speed, Han Xiao and Nagakin had been able to quickly whittle down all of his HP.

After a series of violent attacks, Nagakin had finally vented all of his anger. He had been surrounded by Anur and Ember last time and suffered pretty severe injuries. This time, he had finally gotten his revenge. Usually, when he fought an enemy of the same grade, the enemy would pull away after a couple of blows. How would he get the opportunity to beat his target up to his heart’s content?

Even if an ordinary person was violently beaten up by another person without avoiding any attacks, if the one attack had the desire to kill, this short time would be sufficient to beat a person to death.

However, Anur still had a single breath left.

Bang!

The badly battered Wind Demon landed on the ground and reverted to his human form. Injuries could be seen all over, and his entire body was covered in blood. He was like a broken gunny sack, and the bleeding would not stop.

Anur spat out a mouthful of blood and breathed weakly. He was already nearing his end and could not even stand up. He glared at Han Xiao fiercely with the look of shock and anger in his eyes.

“To think I... I would actually die here...”

Nagakin rubbed his fists, and the storm in his heart had not settled. Black Star indeed did not go back on his word and was worth trusting.

Han Xiao heaved a sigh of relief but was also exhausted. Thankfully, his trump card had been extremely successful. However, he had never expected to use up the Ames Character Summon Card so shortly after obtaining it. Only by killing Anur would he be able to regain all of his losses. There was still the last strike left, so he raised his hands to stop Nagakin.

He had to deal the final strike himself so that he would be able to gain the experience points from killing the enemy.

Anur turned to look at the Protector who was nearby. This was his final hope.

However, the Protector suddenly slowed down and pretended as though he could not make it in time.

Han Xiao did not hesitate and raised his High Frequency Strike Cannon. Looking at Anur’s furious eyes, he smashed it down toward Anur’s chest.

Puchi.

A blade penetrated through Anur’s back but not much blood flowed out. At this moment, almost all of Anur’s blood had already flowed out.

Anur’s body shook, and he grabbed onto the blade. His eyes became listless as he looked up at the sky.

His lips parted, and he said his final words in a voice that no one could hear.

“DarkStar... forever.”

The next moment, he released the blade, and his hands collapsed onto the ground.

Life had left this body.

Han Xiao heaved a sigh of relief, and at that moment, a notice appeared on the interface.

_____________________

Han Xiao was not surprised that his damage output was so low. Nagakin was the one who had dealt the truly fatal blow, and it was more accurate to say that Nagakin had killed Anur while he picked up benefits from the side.

Of course, without his Character Summon Card, Nagakin would not have been able to kill Anur.

He had received over 33,000,000 EXP from killing Anur, and this was his greatest reward so far. It could be said to have replenish his EXP pool.

The biggest harvest was that he had completed an extremely difficult target in the ranked A mission [Godora’s Ally]. Han Xiao had never imagined that he would be able to get rid of a Calamity Grade Super.

The violent winds began dispersing, and smoke filled the air.

Looking at Anur’s corpse, be it the enemies or mercenaries, everyone was dumbfounded.

They had never imagined that this Calamity Grade Super would die.

Even Anur himself had never imagined it.

“For a Calamity Grade Super to die in battle, DarkStar will probably go crazy from anger. Because of a traitor, they lost two high grade combatants and suffered a huge loss. I will probably enter their sights and face a far greater risk than before.”

Han Xiao let out a sigh. Killing Anur would probably affect him in the future, but the previous scenario was already one where it was either Anur’s death or his. Han Xiao would not show any mercy to Anur because of that and let the dying Anur off.

There was still just under a year to Version 2.0, and Han Xiao was planning to make his preparations in the upcoming year. As for DarkStar placing their attention on him, Han Xiao was not too anxious. Once Version 2.0 arrived, he would have to solve the Mutation Disaster and come into direct conflict with DarkStar.

DarkStar was an enemy that he would have to deal with eventually in the Main Storyline of Version 2.0, and this is only a matter of time.

Han Xiao looked around at his surroundings. With Anur dead, the morale of the DarkStar warriors collapsed. However, the protective shield had sealed off all their routes of escape.

“The situation here is already safe. I wonder how the situation on Alvin’s side is...”
