Chapter 1452 Choice and Entry

Crack...

Han Xiao opened the cabinet and took out a box of unopened cigarettes from it. He tore open the packaging and took out a black cigarette wrapped in gold patterns. He swiped at it with his finger, and an electric spark lit it up. He held it in his mouth and slowly took a puff. Green smoke rose and covered his complicated expression, and his disappointed eyes could be seen through the smoke. Ever since he entered the galaxy, Han Xiao had basically quit smoking. It had been almost a hundred years since he had last tasted a smoke, but today, he lit up a cigarette.

This was not an easy choice. If his hometown was the real universe of the current dynasty, then once the dark side universe returned, it would be like a dove taking over a magpie’s nest, and countless powerful civilizations would sweep through the galaxy. Han Xiao did not know if there were any advanced civilizations in the real universe of the current dynasty because his hometown was only a surface-level civilization and could not explore the entire universe. However, his hometown was an information interface, so it would definitely be the first to face a change.

To his hometown, this was either a good thing or a bad thing. The only thing he was certain of was that his hometown would never develop freely again. It would definitely be interfered with by the advanced civilizations, just like the various small civilizations and surface civilizations in the galactic society.

However, the three Universal Civilizations, which had already gone through four dark side changes, were already half a step into the real universe. They were only one step away from the real universe and they had a chance to truly get through the Reboot. This was the ultimate dream passed down by the Final Civilizations after countless generations. Now that he had the ability to help them succeed... should he watch the efforts of the three Universal Civilizations go to waste? Or should he give them the final push?

ISV

Although Han Xiao was conflicted, he knew that he already had an answer in his heart. Revealing the Sanctum information to the three Universal Civilizations was to help him make up his mind not to turn back.

This was a great achievement that was supported by countless generations. It was also a great honor for him to be one of them. Furthermore, it was also related to the survival of the universe. The time he had spent in the galactic society had long exceeded the length of his life in the real universe. It was impossible for him to not have any feelings for the galactic society.

Furthermore, with Han Xiao’s current experience, he felt that the possibility of his hometown becoming the current Final Civilization of this iteration was extremely low. Perhaps even becoming a Star System Civilization would be an extravagant hope.

In the middle of the 21st century, before he entered the dark side universe, the societal problems in his hometown were already very acute. It was like a train that had been overloaded for many years, with all kinds of failures coming one after another.

Due to the complex geopolitical situation, the entire civilization was wasting precious’ birthplace resources’, and the efficiency of resources was low. There were many problems that could only be solved before entering the interstellar era, and only then would the cost be minimized. Their hometown did not have an efficient collective will when their technology was low, and once such an opportunity was missed, it would be difficult to see it again. As the saying goes, a small boat is easy to turn around. The larger the body, the harder it is to turn back, and it would be difficult to make any changes. Any slight movement might trigger an internal crisis that could destroy the entire civilization.

Although his hometown might have a chance to turn around in the future, according to the trend before Han Xiao entered the dark side universe, the development of his hometown, if analyzed on the scale of civilization and the universe, was truly in a precarious situation. Therefore, after the birth of the virtual network in his previous life, it quickly became a haven for countless people to escape from reality.

According to this trend, the final outcome of his hometown might be natural death or being destroyed or captured by an unknown foreign civilization. In his eyes, most of the areas around his hometown did not have the qualifications to become the overlord of the universe... unless there were no competitors.

However, due to the existence of the Sanctum, this was clearly impossible.

Therefore, Han Xiao felt that since it would be difficult for his hometown to become the ‘winner’ of a single era, when the conversion of the dark universe was completed—while it might bring about risks—it would also bring along the successful plan to get through the Great Reboot. This would mean unlimited resources and techniques. The current final Civilizations might not have matured yet, and the three Universal Civilizations would most likely replace it and rule it for a long time. This would be somewhat unfair to the current Iterated Civilizations, but in this regard, no civilization would not give in to be the leader of the universe. It was very difficult for the weak to choose their own fate... Of course, there was also the possibility of a powerful civilization existing in the real universe, but the civilization level of their hometown was too low for him to be aware of it.

In addition, Han Xiao felt that he had come to the Dark Side Universe because of the three Universal Civilizations. Perhaps he should return the favor.

“In the end, I still have my own selfish motives...”

Han Xiao narrowed his eyes and suddenly shook his head.

He had never thought of himself as a selfless person. Apart from these concerns that involved the big picture, there were also reasons for him to choose to convert the Dark Side Universe.

He seemed to have used up all his luck to become the ‘Stable Interference Bridge’ that was randomly selected. If he did not do anything, the Dark Side Universe would only experience another round of reboot and might not have much of an impact on this place. However, in the next Dark Side, the Dark Side Universe would pull in a new True Form carrier and become a new ‘Stable Interference Bridge’ to replace him.

Due to the uniqueness of his identity, Han Xiao could not guarantee that he would become a member of the Dark Side Universe’s development trajectory after the Dark Side underwent another iteration. Becoming a Transcendent might not mean that he could literally transcend an iteration. The ‘Small Reboot’ of the Dark Side Universe might still cause him to disappear... Rather than saying that his choice was to save the Dark Side Universe, it would be more accurate to say that it was to save himself. Therefore, this might be his only chance. Han Xiao did not want to gamble. “Phew... so this is an all-out invasion?”

With this in mind, Han Xiao calmed himself down and stopped smoking. He extinguished the cigarette roll that was only one-third burnt in the ashtray without hesitation.

A few days later, in a certain military-restricted area in the Central Galaxy.

Three small spaceships hovered outside the space fortress, ready to go.

In the military command tower on the side, the remote projection of the three Universal Civilizations’ Ruler stood in front of the window, staring at the three spaceships outside with a nervous and expectant expression. The operators in the room were adjusting the parameters in front of the instruments.

This time, Han Xiao’s remote projection appeared in the room, attracting the attention of three people. “How’s the preparation going?” “We have already filled up the Sanctum key in the synthesis device according to the method you provided,” Marbruce replied immediately.

Han Xiao nodded. “What about the candidates to enter the Sanctum?”

Louis said with a deep voice, “We have all chosen a spaceship full of elites, and their loyalty is reliable. Our side will be led by Oulou, and the Crimson Dynasty will be led by Clotti.”

Han Xiao looked at the Pope and said, “What about you? Are you going to let Wuornos take the lead?”

“I originally planned to let Wuornos enter the Sanctum, but he happened to have left some time ago, so I found another direct descendant.” The Pope shook his head.

“...Is that so? What a twist of events.”

Han Xiao’s expression was complicated.

Due to the fact that he needed to accumulate the authority of the Sanctum, he did not know if the Arcane Church would allow Wuornos to become the Sanctum Explorer even after he returned...

Great, he had missed out on another huge benefit. He always felt that Wuornos seemed to miss out on everything good. This guy was really unlucky.

Seeing that Han Xiao did not speak, Louis said, “If there’s no problem, shall we begin?”

“Go ahead, I’ll watch from here.” Han Xiao nodded.

Marbruce nodded and gave the order.

Very soon, a few rays of light shot out from the military fortress and gathered in midair, slowly turning into three Sanctums. The Sanctums Key that Han Xiao had provided each led to different Sanctums, and they were all opened at the same time.

Han Xiao had seen this scene many times and did not have much of a reaction. However, the heads of the three Universal Civilizations stared with their eyes wide open, staring at the changes in the scenery outside the window. It was as though they wanted to memorize all the details of the Sanctum passageway.

The next moment, the three spaceships started moving and entered different passages of the Sanctum. The Sanctum’s light then spun and contracted before disappearing from everyone’s sight.

Only at this moment did the three Universal Civilizations’ leaders relax. They heaved a sigh of relief and were filled with anticipation and anxiety. They were afraid that something would happen during their trip to the Sanctum, or they might not bring back the information they wanted. “This is their first time entering the Sanctum. Their authority is very low, and the time flow is very different. It will take them a very long time to return.”

Han Xiao explained.

Marbruce nodded absent-mindedly. Suddenly, he thought of something and turned to look at Han Xiao.

“Since it will take a long time for them to return, let’s not just blindly wait for them. We might as well use the time to solve some important problems.” Han Xiao raised his brows. “What do you want?”

“Initially, we wanted to wait until the galactic society recovered more than half of its strength before launching a military operation against the Star Alliance. However, the intelligence you brought disrupted our strategic plans, so I think it’s better to solve this hidden danger as soon as possible... However, we alone cannot proceed with the highest efficiency, so...”

SOO

“So, you want my help?” Han Xiao narrowed his eyes and continued.

“That’s what I meant.” Marbruce nodded quickly. Han Xiao turned to look at the other two. “You guys have the same idea?”

“I hope Your Excellency Black Star can help.”

Louis and the Pope nodded as well.

Ever since they knew the truth about the Universe Iterations, they had become more relaxed. They were all in the same boat now, so helping the other party meant helping themselves, and they were no longer as reserved as before. They were just short of hugging Han Xiao’s thigh and calling him daddy.

“...You guys are really impolite. Let me do some research then.”

Looking at the three of them, Han Xiao’s mouth twitched.

Originally, he did not want to interfere in this matter. However, given the current situation, if he did not settle the Star Alliance as soon as possible, there would be more variables in the plan of converting the dark universe. It was indeed not good. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Han Xiao thought about it and said slowly,

“If I can solve this problem with less bloodshed, that would be the best. I hope that my interference will allow them to accept reality faster...”
