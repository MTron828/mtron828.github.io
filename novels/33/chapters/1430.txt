Chapter 1431 Rescue and Waiting For A Miracle

More than ten refugee transport ships were speeding in the planetary space, and there was a World Tree fleet chasing after them.

The atmosphere in the cabin of the carrier was tense. Many refugees were panicking, especially the ship that was the most heavily damaged, White Mountain. You could almost see the word ‘despair’ written on the refugees’ faces.

“The reinforcements haven’t arrived yet... If this continues, we’ll be caught.”

The captain of White Mountain was sweating profusely as he stared at the ship inspection report on the virtual screen. On the three-dimensional virtual model of White Mountain, the functional modules of the ship were all red, showing malfunction issues. The entire ship was on the verge of collapse, and one-quarter of the 28 propulsion engines were damaged. The power of the energy core had also decreased to 74%.

Because some areas were frequently invaded by the World Tree and became dangerous areas, some of the refugee planets were no longer safe. The galactic alliance army formed a transport team to migrate the refugees in these areas, and this small fleet carried this mission to transport some refugees.

However, halfway through the journey, they happened to meet the World Tree fleet that was hiding in their territory. An encounter broke out, and the smaller fleet was wiped out. Most of the transport ships were destroyed on the spot, and the remaining ships fled in panic, still being chased by the World Tree fleet.

As for the White Mountain transport ship, it was the most damaged among all the existing starships. Its modules were malfunctioning, and its speed gradually decreased, slowing down the entire fleet.

“At most, at most ten minutes, the engine will shut down. There’s a desolate planet with a serial number in front of us. Should we land?”

The vice commander’s trembling voice sounded. The captain of White Mountain clenched his fists and hesitated.

If they were forced to land, the people on the entire ship would have no way to escape. They could only let the guards on the ship hide on the planet with the refugees and wait for reinforcements.

The suggestions of the other captains came through the communication channel.

“White Mountain, land. Your ship is no longer able to keep up with the speed of the main fleet. We can’t slow down and wait for you.”

“You will be alone sooner or later. Instead of being paralyzed in space, it’s better to hide on the planet. At least there’s a chance of survival.”

“Leave the White Mountain behind and buy us some time to save more refugees.”

Some stood on the side of rational analysis, while others made blatant requests, trying to persuade the White Mountain to stay. “I understand...”

The captain of White Mountain had a helpless look on his face.

He understood that it would be better for them to stay behind and stall for time for the refugees on the other ships.

Even so, he felt very guilty. In the report, this batch of refugees was just a cold number, but they were all alive at the moment. Using his own ship of refugees to help more refugees might be in line with the calculation of benefits, but he could not bear to do it logically. These refugees were not soldiers, and they had no intention of sacrificing themselves. Furthermore, he could not possibly make this decision after discussing it with the refugees, or it would most likely cause a mutiny. He could only silently lead them to stay behind to cover their retreat while others still had hope and believed in the captain. This made him feel very uncomfortable.

Just as he was trapped in a dilemma, the desolate planet appeared in front of the transport fleet. The eyes of the many captains immediately lit up, and they saw a small armed fleet without a symbol docked on the surface of the planet. Only when they got close did the radar detect the presence of the other party. “There’s actually a fleet lying in ambush here? They don’t look like they’re from the World Tree.”

“Are they our reinforcements? Forget it, no matter who they are, they’re all part of the galactic society.”

“Quick, contact the other party and send a signal!”

All of a sudden, the captains were overjoyed. They thought that reinforcements had arrived and hurriedly sent out a request for help.

On the other side, Pangon and the others, who were resting on this desolate planet, started discussing.

“This seems to be an escaping refugee fleet. The World Tree fleet is chasing after them.”

“They’re asking us for help. What should we do? Should we help?”

“Don’t help. The lives of the galactic residents under the three Universal Civilizations have nothing to do with us. Let’s go, don’t involve ourselves in their affairs.”

Everyone quickly exchanged their opinions and reached a consensus.

This group of avengers was not on the side of the three Universal Civilizations. Even if the World Tree invaded completely, it would have nothing to do with them. It would be extremely benevolent of them not to add insult to injury.

Pangon was silent for a while before speaking. “In that case, reject all their contact requests and leave immediately.”

The captains of the transport fleet were looking forward to the reply of this unfamiliar armed fleet, but all their communication requests were useless.

The next moment, their expressions changed. This unfamiliar armed fleet rose into the sky and ignored the distress signal, heading in another direction. It was obvious that they were heading away, meaning they did not want to provide support.

“They’re gone, not our reinforcements.” “Looks like I can’t count on this group...”

The many captains’ hopes were dashed.

Seeing that there was no turning point, the captain of White Mountain gritted his teeth and finally made up his mind.

“Attention all units. Separate the ship’s cargo hold, load all the crew, and carry out orbital suppression. Set up the process of turning back to face the attack. Cover the departure of the brothers.”

Hearing this, everyone’s expression turned solemn. They knew that the White Mountain had chosen to sacrifice.

Although they hoped that would be the case, they were not too happy when it actually happened.

Very soon, the group split up. The majority of the troops continued to flee into the distance, while White Mountain slowed down and left the troops. It turned around and flew toward the desolate planet. It looked like a lone stream of light in a sea of shooting stars. In outer space, White Mountain quickly completed its transformation. The thick armor shell was no longer locked onto each other, and mechanical parts started moving one after another. The entire carrier arched like a shrimp, and the cabin on its abdomen separated, turning into an iron-gray escape ship. Its body shrunk a lot, and it had practically no armaments as it descended toward the planet.

As for the spaceships that remained in place, they were like a hollow armor shell that operated on its own. The cannons on the spaceships fired fiercely toward the back, trying to stop the World Tree fleet that was gradually approaching.

Bang!

The escape ship landed heavily on the planet’s surface, creating a crater. All the hatches opened simultaneously, and the refugees who had been forced to change their life support equipment rushed out of the cabin. They looked up at the sky with despair and panic in their eyes.

The World Tree fleet had already arrived in outer space, and a round of fire destroyed the armor shell that they had left in outer space. It slowly descended and expanded before everyone’s eyes like a shadow.

“Why did you stop?!”

“Why are you landing here? You’ve caused us to be surrounded!”

The refugees were in an uproar. They glared at the guards beside them with hatred and anger. Without their knowledge, the captain had ordered the spaceship to land, turning their chance of escape into zero.

“Everyone, listen up. Split up with the ship’s warriors.”

The captain of the White Mountain did not explain. Now was not the time to say more. He could only give the order with a stern face.

He knew that everyone’s chances of survival were close to zero after being forced to surrender, but he still wanted to make a final effort and hide with the refugees.

However, the next moment, when he saw the actions of the World Tree battleships clearly, he finally fell into despair. He saw that the cannons of the World Tree fleet were aimed at the planet’s surface. They were planning to save time and cleanse the planet.

“I’m dead for sure... However, letting the World Tree fleet shoot here for a few rounds would delay them. I’ve fulfilled my mission...”

The captain of the White Mountain clenched his fists tightly. His expression changed rapidly. He was both unwilling yet relieved.

However, just as the people raised their heads and looked at the Planetary Obliteration Cannon that destroyed them with fear, a bright light suddenly shot from another direction in the starry sky and penetrated several World Tree battleships, blowing them up like fireworks.

Everyone looked over in shock, only to see a shooting star covered in thick flames rapidly approaching. Powerful Pugilist flames shot out like heavy cannons, bombarding the World Tree fleet one after another, blowing the battleships into pieces.

Behind Pangon was the armed fleet that had just left. In the blink of an eye, they had destroyed the World Tree fleet.

The battle did not last long. Under the watchful eyes of the crew of the White Mountain, Pangon led the Avengers fleet and quickly wiped out all the enemy spaceships in the sky. The huge World Tree fleet was only left with wreckage and parts floating in outer space. This wave of escape from death made many refugees unable to control their emotions, and the crowd cheered wildly. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The captain of the White Mountain seemed to have woken up from a dream. He hurriedly asked someone to contact this armed fleet to express his gratitude. However, the other party did not reply to him even after they had finished fighting the World Tree fleet. It was as if they had only done him a small favor and did not even bother to clean up the battlefield.

“These obviously are not the people of the Galactic Alliance Army. What kind of army is this...”

The captain of White Mountain looked at the departing Avengers and mumbled to himself.

At this time, Pangon returned to the main ship. His other comrades surrounded him with strange expressions.

“You’re really something. You promised not to get involved in the war, but you suddenly made us turn around and fight.”

“If we are targeted by the World Tree because of this battle, it will be troublesome. It will not be beneficial for us to accumulate our strength.”

“Whose side are you on?”

The attitude of the few of them was as though they were interrogating him. Pangon did not mind and waved his hand expressionlessly. “I’ve changed my mind. Although we won’t take the initiative to participate in the war, if we encounter something like this again in the future, we’ll save them if we can. Our target of revenge is the regime of the three Universal Civilizations, and the ordinary galactic residents have no grudges with us.”

“This is exposing our existence,” one of his comrades said with dissatisfaction.

“To Black Star, our existence is not a secret to begin with. If we cause any adverse effects to the war, he can tell the three Universal Civilizations about us at any time. After all, we have never been on the same side.” Pangon paused for a moment before continuing, “Furthermore, more than half of the galactic society has guessed that the World Tree’s full invasion is because a traitor leaked the information. Do you think Black Star won’t suspect us?”

Everyone was stunned.

“In his eyes, we have sufficient motive to do so. If we don’t express our goodwill and let Black Star think that we did it, even if we don’t participate in the war, we can’t stay out of it,” Pangon explained.

Hearing this, the few of them looked at each other, slightly shaken.

“You’re clearly just a Pugilist, but why do we feel that what you say makes sense every time you trick us?”

In a certain place in the secondary dimension.

A spatial rift opened, and Hayleen flew out from within.

Under the enhancement of her special talent spell and the Leaf Cloak, her current state was almost ‘outside the Three Realms and not within the Five Elements’. She could not be observed normally.

“The whereabouts of the Pivotal Snake are mysterious. The mother tree only has a rough direction and range, and there’s no clear location. What should I do...”

Hayleen was troubled. After accepting the mission of the Ancestral Tree King, she had been searching for information about the appearance of the Pivotal Snake for the past half a year, but she had never found an opportunity to assassinate it.

Furthermore, it seemed like Black Star had always been by the side of the Pivotal Snake. To her, that was the most dangerous place in the universe. She held onto the principle of not taking risks if she could and never dared to go near it.

After thinking about it, the only feasible method that Hayleen could think of was to add a ‘snake-killing agent’ made by the mother tree to some secondary dimensions where the Pivotal Snake often appeared. Then, they would wait patiently. If the Hub Serpent ate one of the secondary dimensions, it would be poisoned.

Although this method was very random, she did not have a better idea for the time being. After all, she could not control the source of food for the Pivotal Snake, so she could only spread her net and try her luck.

The only advantage of this method was that it was safer, and she did not have to take the risk of being exposed to get close to Black Star, giving her a lot of opportunities to test her luck.

Hayleen raised her hand, and a dark green liquid appeared. It was the ‘Snake-killing agent’ that the Ancestral Tree King had given her.

With a flick of her finger, a small drop of dark green liquid separated and fused into the ground of this secondary dimension. “I hope this method works...”

Hayleen muttered to herself, not knowing how to proceed.
