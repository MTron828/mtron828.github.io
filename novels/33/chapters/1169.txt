Chapter 1170 Anyone Can Be the Mechanic Emperor

“Thank you, Your Excellency Black Star, for your help. We’ll certainly relay the help you’ve given to Planet Earth Ring today to the upper echelons.”

Inside the cabin, as Han Xiao told his subordinates to get rid of the Soul Swap Twins’ corpses, he received a communication request from the Planet Earth Ring manager. “It’s no big deal.” Han Xiao waved.

“No, no, it was only thanks to your help that the Mechanic Emperor’s evil deeds were stopped. On behalf of the Razo Civilization, I would like to thank you for your help. Please do stay and let us thank you!”

The Planet Earth Ring manager’s tone was passionate.

Having just witnessed such a marvelous battle, Han Xiao’s image was extremely tall in his heart. He did not dare show any disrespect and hoped to leave a good impression, so his attitude was respectful and enthusiastic.

Furthermore, the Mechanic Emperor coming to cause trouble would affect his political performance, and Black Star defeating the Mechanic Emperor did him a big favor. Black Star might not care, but that did not mean he did not care.

“No need, I’ll be leaving after the battlefield is cleaned up.” Han Xiao shook his head. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Alright then, please inform me the next time you come to Planet Earth Ring. I’ll display the utmost hospitality.” The manager of Planet Earth Ring was full of appreciation. “There’ll be chances in the future.”

Han Xiao chatted with him for a while before hanging up the communication. He told Phillip to save his number into the contacts book, where he stored the communicator numbers of all the people he knew till now, forming an enormous network.

He saved not just the numbers of important people but also the numbers of less significant people from various industries. Everyone had their specialties, so they might be of help some time in the future.

Although the quantum network of the planet was in lockdown, everyone on the planet had witnessed what happened. God only knew how many videos had been taken. Once those videos got out, Han Xiao’s reputation would certainly grow once more.

After the Intelligent Plague incident, the three Universal Civilizations had continuously promoted his achievement of reaching a tie with the Mechanic Emperor. However, due to it not being completely true at the time, although the effects were quite good, it was not nearly perfect.

This time, however, the recordings of him destroying the Mechanic Emperor’s avatar head-on would be the most reliable proof!

Increased reputation was not even the most important. What was most important was that now that the Mechanic Emperor had lost to him this time, he would lose a ton of Machinery Faith believers!

It did not matter even if he lost a few times because he was much younger. However, as the known ‘Strongest Mechanic’, Manison losing had a completely different meaning. It would be disastrous for his reputation.

There was no such thing as a loyal fan in the Machinery Faith. They believed in whoever was stronger.

If Manison lost his title of being the ‘strongest’, tons of believers would turn to Han Xiao instead. Manison would become weaker while he would become stronger!

Speaking of becoming stronger, Han Xiao remembered that he had yet to receive the reward for the Manison challenge mission.

The mission was a usual Beyond Grade A challenge mission, giving rewards based on the time he lasted.

Since everyone was there, Han Xiao could finally do the full ‘Pet Dragon Touch Feidin Rub Nero Touch Harrison’ procedure.

Han Xiao went by them one after another. Harrison was the only one shivering with fear; the other three were used to it. Only then did he open the interface while being stared at by Hila with a strange look.

(Beyond Grade A Challenge Mission – “Mechanic Emperor” Manison) complete!

You have completed all the mission requirements and received 108 billion Experience.

You have received (Character Summon Card: ‘Mechanic Emperor’ Manison).

Character Summon Card: ‘Mechanic Emperor’ Manison. (Ancient One]: Your long life has provided you with a wealth of valuable experience. +20% INT, +10% MYS, +2 levels to all skills. Last 24 hours. Usages: 0/2

“Ancient One again?” Han Xiao was surprised.

If he remembered correctly, this should be the third time he had earned this ability from old Manison’s Character Summon Card. It was quite a strong advanced talent, so why did he get it so often?

Was it fated that he was meant to be an elderly with rich life experience?

Han Xiao’s mouth twitched. He then looked at the part where he could draw one of Manison’s talents or skills. This was the most important part.

You have received: Draw one of Manison’s abilities/talents.

Note: Manison is a Virtual Mechanic, and your Class is completely compatible with his. You will be able to draw any of his abilities or talents. If you draw an ability or talent that you already possess, that ability or talent will be enhanced.

Randomizing... complete! Please select one from the five options below as the reward:

[Apostle Life Creation] – Ability: Lord Mechanic ability, you can modify the target machine into an ‘Apostle Weapon’, granting it tremendous combat capability enhancement. Basic allocation: 3. Allocation is increased by 1 every level. (You already possess this ability, can be enhanced.)

(Multidimensional Mind Model] – Talent: Changes the calculation method of your mind and increases the data processing speed of your brain. +1,000 INT, slightly increases your casting speed, Virtual Technology strength...

[Mechanical Race Battle TechniqueGuerrilla) – Ability: One of the combat modes passed down in the Mechanical Race. It focuses on high mobility long range guerrilla combat. This includes 744 responses for different situations. When activated, the mechanical army will receive the following effects: +15% mobility, +8.8% ranged attack damage, -5% defense.

(Blueprint-Virtual Mutiny Virus (Incomplete)] – Ability: A product Manison created by imitating the Virtual Mutiny Virus, yet to be completed. It is not fully functional, far from perfection, and cannot be put to use.

(Virtual Technology Innovation-Manison] – Talent: You have made improvements to your Virtual Technology and found a new direction. +1.75% Virtual Technology related abilities, grants special effects when an innovation is discovered in the Virtual Technology area.

“Yoho, another Unique Talent!” Han Xiao was overjoyed.

He had seen this Unique Talent on the interface the first time he met the Mechanic Emperor. The bonuses of (Virtual Technology Innovation-Manison) were quite amazing. Plus, it seemed to be a crucial foundation to mastering the Indestructible Mechanical Troops technology. Manison used this ability when modifying the artificial intelligence lives.

If he got this ability, he might really make some breakthrough in studying the Indestructible Mechanical Troops technology.

He looked at the other four abilities-none of them were as impressive. After all, no way he could get as lucky as the last time every time.

Maybe it was because there were too many people here today who were blessed by the Goddess of Luck and she could not satisfy them all at once.

However, since there was another Unique Talent, he could not consider himself unlucky.

He already had (Apostle Life Creation). (Multidimensional Mind Model] was a mediocre talent. 1,000 points of INT was powerful at lower levels, but it was ordinary at his current level. [Mechanical Race Battle Technique-Guerrilla] was a strategy-type ability for the mechanical army, like giving the mechanical army a formation response for different situations. This type of ability usually did not give a lot of bonuses; (BlueprintVirtual Mutiny Virus (Incomplete)] was even more useless. This was nothing but a mimicry Manison had yet to fully complete, while he had the original Domino Virus technology.

Since the other four options were nothing extraordinary, Han Xiao chose the fifth option without hesitation.

You have received the talent (Virtual Technology Innovation-Manison)!

Another Unique Talent... I might really become the second Manison if this carries on.

Han Xiao tutted.

He then felt his new ability for a while before turning off the interface and glancing outside the window.

At this point, his troops were still cleaning up the battlefield, seizing Manison’s mechanical soldiers batch by batch. This was a huge fortune if changed into Enas. At this time, he felt a message on the quantum network. Risda was contacting him.

As he entered the Virtual Domain, he saw that Risda had come to him with a large group of artificial intelligence lives.

“Black Star, I’ve spoken with my people and clarified the situation. They’re all willing to trust you. In order to not get captured by the Mechanic Emperor, everyone is willing to follow you for the time being, hoping that you can take care of them,” Risda said with joy.

“Your people have made a wise decision.” Han Xiao looked satisfied.

An artificial intelligence life who seemed like the leader stepped out and said, “Lord Black Star, we all hope to return to what we originally were as soon as possible. We don’t want to be restrained anymore. Therefore, everyone has decided to fully cooperate with you and help you to derive the modification technology the Mechanic Emperor has used on us, only hoping we can be of use to you.” “Very good!” Han Xiao laughed.

The cooperation of these artificial intelligence lives was necessary to derive the technology of Indestructible Mechanical Troops. Since they were willing to cooperate, it was great news.

“Also, we’re willing to tell you everything we know about the Mechanic Emperor. Whatever you want to know, we will tell you to our best knowledge.”

“That’ll be very helpful.” Han Xiao nodded.

After being used by Manison for so many years, the Indestructible Mechanical Troops definitely knew some valuable secrets, which would be of great assistance to him.

These artificial intelligence lives were so cooperative probably because they knew he was the only one they could rely on now, and they needed his power to save the rest of their people. Many artificial intelligence lives were still in Manison’s hands, especially the forefather of the AI civilization, Finette.

Beep beep...

At this time, a notification popped up on the interface. It was a new round of the [Reboot) mission, also the last round.

Han Xiao glanced through, and his eyes sparkled. “The requirement of the last round is to completely free the AI civilization... Whew, the rewards are quite generous!” The reward of the last round was a Milestone Talent called (Ally of Artificial Intelligence Lives), and the effects of it were the enhanced version of (Affable AI].

Han Xiao also saw the hidden reward—if he could save the entire AI civilization, they would become his powerful allies in the virtual territory.

Also, completing the (Reboot) series mission was also an amazing opportunity to make Manison weaker.

However, Manison would definitely have learned a lesson this time. Before Manison figured out how he did what he did in their battle, there was no way Manison would use these two trump cards in front of him again.

In order to save the other artificial intelligence lives, the only way was to charge into Mechanic Emperor’s nest and destroy the terminal of the Indestructible Mechanical Troops technology.

All kinds of thoughts flashed past. Han Xiao smiled and said, “Settle your people. When we return to my territory, I’ll arrange to give you guys a planet to live on.”

“Thank you, Black Star.” Risda nodded solemnly.

Exiting the quantum network vision, Han Xiao let out a deep breath. He was filled with joy.

At this time, Ames came before him and softly asked, “What are you planning to do next?”

“I’ve got what I came for. The twins are dead too, so next, of course, we need to deal with the one who’s behind this.”

“When do we act?” Ames could not wait. “You promised to bring me this time.”

“Hmm, no hurry, let me think about it.” Han Xiao narrowed his eyes.

Since he knew that the Modo Civilization was the mastermind behind this, there was no way he was going to let this go easily.

It was time to teach the Modo Civilization a painful lesson!
