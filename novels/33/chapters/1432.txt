Chapter 1433 Going for Wool and Coming Home Shorn

At the same time, somewhere in the secondary dimension world, Hayleen was wandering around, choosing a new target.

Very soon, she arrived in a blue liquid world. She popped out the snake-killing agent and watched it dissolve in the liquid. As she worked, her thoughts drifted away.

“I wonder if the poison I planted earlier worked...”

Hayleen murmured.

She could only plant the poison everywhere, but she did not dare go back to check. If the Pivotal Snake was infected, Black Star would definitely be waiting nearby. If she went over, there might be some risk.

The only way to determine if the plan was successful was to determine the status of the Pivotal Snake based on the mother tree’s reaction. If the mother tree’s reaction to the Pivotal Snake weakened or disappeared, it would mean that the Pivotal Snake was dead. In that case, she would not have to check which trap the Pivotal Snake had fallen into.

Therefore, Hayleen felt that she was still in a safe situation. All she needed to do was to set up the traps. As long as the mother tree gave her feedback, she would be able to retreat.

After adding the snake-killing agent to the blue secondary dimension in front of her, Hayleen was about to turn around and leave. However, at this moment, the voice of the Ancestral Tree King suddenly came from the mental network, bringing good news.

“The mother tree’s connection to the Pivot Snake is rapidly weakening. Your method should have succeeded.”

“It really succeeded? So fast ” The chances are so low, I thought it would take at least a few years for the Pivotal Snake to choose the secondary dimension that I tampered with...”

Hayleen’s eyes lit up with joy. She had thought that she might need to spend two to three years planting snake-killing agents in enough secondary dimensions so that the Pivotal Snake would have a higher chance of falling for it. However, the plan had only started half a year ago. There were not many secondary dimensions that were injected with the poison, but the Pivotal Snake had chosen one so quickly. What kind of probability was this? What kind of luck was this ?

In less than a year, she had successfully resolved the biggest threat to the World Tree. It was a pleasant surprise!

The Ancestral Tree King was also in a good mood. He had planned to let Hayleen carry out this mission for a long time, and had not expected it to work so quickly.

Don’t ask why, but if you had to ask, it was God’s will!

This was definitely the blessing of the Goddess of Luck!

“Come back. When the Mother Tree confirms that the Pivotal Snake is dead, the position of the Tree King will be yours.”

“Alright, I’ll go back now!”

Suppressing her excitement, Hayleen was about to open the transportation door and return.

However, just as she was about to return with excitement, the Ancestral Tree King suddenly interrupted her.

“Wait a minute, the mother tree’s reaction has changed...”

“What now?”

“The mother tree’s connection with the Pivot Snake has stopped declining, and it’s becoming stronger instead... Strange, this is too abnormal. What happened?” The Ancestral Tree King’s tone became heavy.

The stronger the World Tree’s reaction to the Pivotal Snake, it signified the more mature the Pivotal Snake would be. Right now, it was only a rough perception range, and they could only accurately determine each other’s location when it reached adulthood.

Just a moment ago, after the signal of the Pivotal Snake weakened for a while, it suddenly rose in reverse and quickly exceeded its previous limit, still rising.

Hayleen paused in shock.

“Why is this happening ?”

“You didn’t do anything unnecessary, did

you?”

The intensity of the sense was still increasing. The Ancestral Tree King felt that something was wrong, and his tone was filled with doubt.

“Absolutely not! I’ve always been focused on setting traps. Even when I coincidentally met the three Universal Civilizations’ fleets, I never took action!”

Hayleen was so anxious that she almost swore an oath and shared the relevant memories on the mental network.

The Ancestral Tree King quickly scanned through her experiences over the past half a year, but he did not find anything out of the ordinary. With a grave expression, he said, “There’s only one explanation. Black Star used some method to save the Pivotal Snake, and he even sped up its growth...”

Before he finished his sentence, the mother tree’s consciousness suddenly became agitated, as if it was feeling intense panic.

However, the sensitivity of the Pivotal Snake seemed to have broken through some kind of restriction. A large area of its detection range suddenly disappeared, turning into a precise coordinate in the blink of an eye!

The Ancestral Tree King’s eyes widened in shock, and his mind went blank.

The connection between the World Tree and the Pivotal Snake was two-way. When the World Tree could accurately locate the Pivotal Snake, it meant that the Pivotal Snake had entered adulthood and could locate the precise coordinates of the World Tree.

This meant that... the mother tree’s location had been exposed!

If he had not confirmed that the mother tree would not lie to him, he would have suspected that the poison that the mother tree had concocted was actually the catalyst for the maturation of the Pivotal Snake.

The Ancestral Tree King was confused.

I sent people to assassinate the Pivotal Snake. Even if she failed, they would only lose one high-level combatant. Why did it cause the Pivotal Snake to mature?

Not only did we not solve this threat, we even shortened the time it took for this hidden danger to erupt... We originally had a few decades to deal with it, but now, this little bit of buffer time is gone. We are now facing imminent danger without any mental preparations.

What should I do?

“How could this be...”

Hayleen was stunned as well. Before the two of them could recover from their shock, a space crack suddenly opened in this secondary dimension. Han Xiao stepped into the void and slowly walked out.

Han Xiao looked around and quickly locked onto a seemingly empty area. It was actually where Hayleen was hiding.

“Do you want to come out yourself, or do you want me to invite you?”

Hayleen was shocked.

The series of unforeseen events had already thrown her into chaos. She did not expect Black Star to find her so quickly, and with just a glance, he had already seen through the stealth effect of the Leaf Concealment Robe and locked onto her location.

“Stop hiding. You can’t escape from my senses.”

Han Xiao did not wait. Beams of mechanical particles flowed along his arm and turned into a circular device, releasing an invisible force field toward Hayleen.

In the empty space, Hayleen’s figure suddenly appeared and rippled.

Seeing that her position was exposed, Hayleen was shocked and hurriedly opened the transportation door to retreat. However, at this moment, Han Xiao raised his hand and grabbed it. A mechanical disc rose from the back of his head like a crown of light, freezing the space and shattering her teleportation spell.

Following this, a bunch of Mechanical Oracles surged out from the Mechanical Force and surrounded Hayleen, but they did not attack immediately.

“Crap...”

Hayleen felt despair in her heart. The difference in strength was too great. She could not fight a Transcendent alone. She clenched her teeth and made up her mind to fight to the death. However, at this moment, the shocked voice of the Ancestral Tree King suddenly sounded in her mind.

“Wait a minute, why is the mother tree’s coordinates of the Pivot Snake on Black Star?”

Hayleen was stunned. She took a look and was shocked.

The mother tree had locked onto the Pivotal Snake coordinates, and it was Black Star... what was going on ? This time, Han Xiao did not make a move immediately. Instead, he looked at Hayleen with interest and said, “Your idea of ambushing the Pivotal Snake was quite good, but it’s useless. I know that you have the mental network to contact each other regardless of distance. Help me send a message to the Ancestral Tree King. I already know the location of your World Tree’s main body. You’ve already lost this battle.”

“What did you do...” Hayleen could not help but ask.

“Are you referring to how I got rid of the genetic toxin you guys released?”

Han Xiao smiled. He raised his hand, and a translucent snake appeared in his palm. It was the Pivotal Snake that had been transformed into a Virtual Life Form.

The Pivotal Snake had transformed into a Virtual Life Form, and Han Xiao had instilled a large amount of data into it, nurturing it through artificial intelligence.

The result made him overjoyed. His previous idea was correct. The Pivotal Snake in the Virtual Life Form had escaped the limit of normal growth, and it could mature quickly this way. The connection between the Pivotal Snake and the World Tree in the Information Form did not disappear because of the Pivotal Snake’s life form change. Both parties still had a two-way connection.

From (Bold Explorer), Han Xiao saw the World Tree’s assassination plan. He originally thought that he was unlucky, but after seeing the short interaction between Hayleen and Harrison, he was a little uncertain and had a bold guess.

Maybe it was the effect of Harrison’s Halo that made Hayleen choose the food of the Pivotal Snake, which indirectly led to the Pivotal Snake turning into a Virtual Life Form, maturing in advance and sensing the coordinates of the World Tree... Although it did not sound probable, Han Xiao felt that anything was possible to a protagonist-type character.

Because the Virtual Life Form was controlled by Han Xiao, he simply stored the Pivotal Snake in the Godly Stronghold and turned it into a tool. This way, even if the World Tree could lock onto the Pivotal Snake in reverse, the coordinates would only be his location. There was no way to avoid him no matter what they did.

Seeing this through the mental network, the Ancestral Tree King’s face turned ashen. He immediately understood the current situation.

I’m afraid we no longer have the chance to remove the threat of the Pivotal Snake...

At this time, Han Xiao narrowed his eyes and said to Hayleen,

“Although you’re here to assassinate the Pivotal Snake, you did me a favor. You could be considered a hero of the three Universal Civilizations. I’ll make an exception and give you a chance to live.”

“...What are you going to do?”

“I will seal you up. Maybe after we get rid of the World Tree, you would still have a chance to survive. You have nowhere to run now, so you might as well accept the seal. Don’t make me waste my energy.” Han Xiao raised his brows.

“I...”

Hayleen sounded hesitant as if she was conflicted.

However, the next moment, she suddenly jumped up and retreated. A series of instantaneous spells were thrown out, creating a path in the mechanical army.

However, before she could do anything, the Mechanical Oracles around her attacked together and suppressed Hayleen instantly. Han Xiao moved closer to Hayleen and grabbed her neck with one hand.

“Looks like you won’t give up until you see your coffin.”

Han Xiao narrowed his eyes and put strength in his hand to crush her protective spell, and threw her toward the Mechanical Oracles.

An intense battle immediately broke out, but there was no suspense in the battle. The one-sided battle did not last long. Hayleen, who was at the end of her rope, was crushed by the group of Mechanical Oracles until she was almost paralyzed.

Seeing this, Han Xiao floated in front of her, pressed down on her head, and activated his ability. Not long after, the Spacetime Amber took form, and Hayleen’s sorrowful and humiliated expression froze.

“Congratulations to the Lord for catching the culprit. Nothing in this world can hide from your eyes,” Psionic Prime said.

“Alright, you’re not suitable for flattery. Go back.”

Han Xiao waved his hands and felt relieved.

If not for the World Tree’s plot, he would not have been able to make up his mind to experiment on the Pivotal Snake so quickly. The World Tree was just throwing stones at its own feet.

“Since the coordinates are already in my hands, I’ll call Harrison back... Speaking of which, I think I’ve taken advantage of his halo.”

Han Xiao thought about it and called the Realmless King to act as a transit station to contact Harrison.

Before long, Harrison’s remote projection appeared.

“Your Excellency Black Star, what can I do for you?”

“Don’t participate in the expedition. Come back.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Harrison was a little surprised. “Huh? Didn’t we talk about this before? I remember you promised not to persuade me. I’ve decided to contribute to the galactic society...”

Before he could finish, Han Xiao interrupted him and smiled.

“Things are different now. The situation has changed. I have already grasped the exact coordinates of the World Tree’s main body and no longer need the expeditionary army. You don’t have to take the unnecessary risk.”

Harrison was stunned. “Your Excellency Black Star, are you trying to trick me into going back? How long has it been?”

Han Xiao smiled and said, “It’s all thanks to your luck this time. If not for you, I might not have been able to determine the location of the World Tree so quickly. Strictly speaking, part of the credit belongs to you. You’ve already made a huge contribution to ending this war, so you can leave now. It’s decided. I’ll teleport over later and bring you back.”

With that, he hung up.

On the other side, Harrison scratched his head in confusion.

No, what did I do? How did I make such a huge contribution? Why don’t I know about it?
