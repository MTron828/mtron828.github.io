Chapter 555: Reactions from All Sides

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“What did you say! Dragon Emperor‽”

Degulish’s eyes froze in place, and he gulped in shock. His chest also tightened as though he had just been struck by a hammer.

Twenty minutes prior, the spies left behind on Planet Aquamarine had sent an emergency report. The intel officer had then hurriedly searched for the current commander of the organization, Degulish, and reported this matter with a pale expression.

Ames had appeared on Planet Aquamarine!

The upper echelons of DarkStar were shocked.

The Dragon Emperor had always been neutral. For her to appear in the Garton Star System suddenly, did it mean that she wanted to enter the fray? No, this was not likely. It was more likely that it was Black Star, that b*stard, who had called Ames over. But why Planet Aquamarine?

After giving the matter much thought, Degulish still could not understand Ames’ intentions.

After analyzing the matter for a while, he felt that this issue was filled with oddities. The other party had chosen to land on Planet Aquamarine, not the mother planet of Godora. It did not seem like she was there for DarkStar but on vacation.

“Black Star is the leader of Floating Dragon Island’s armed forces, and I heard that he has been expanding recently. Perhaps Ames is here to check on her forces’ development,” the intel officer said. “This is the most likely possibility.”

Degulish nodded slowly and solemnly said, “We cannot let our guard down. We have some grievances with the Dragon Emperor, and she could be a possible unknown in our plan. However, as long as we don’t provoke her, she won’t be able to do anything to us. Even if she is a beyond Grade A Super, that only refers to her personal strength. She won’t be able to resolve the current situation.”

Saying that, Degulish let out a small sigh of relief. Previously, he had been frightened by Ames’ reputation and instinctively felt that the matter was grave. But after thinking about it for a while, he realized that it actually was not a big issue.

So what if the Dragon Emperor could fight? They would just have to avoid facing her. Could her personal prowess resolve Godora’s problems?

Even an expert like the Dragon Emperor would not be able to resolve the internal and external problems of Godora with her strength. She was just a single individual, and the vast universe would never be conquered by a single individual!

Degulish then began to ease, and after some thought, he instructed, “Order the spies on Planet Aquamarine to observe Ames’ actions. Make Planet Aquamarine a forbidden location for now; no one is to go near Planet Aquamarine.”

“Er, we didn’t have any intentions to ambush Planet Aquamarine...” The intel officer was extremely helpless. The scene of their assault ships being destroyed by Black Star was still fresh in his memories. He would be a fool to send men over at this moment.

“Right, how is the progress of planting moles in the Black Star Mercenary Group?”

“I bribed some free mercenaries and asked them to apply to enter the Black Star Mercenary Group. Black Star Mercenary Group doesn’t seem to hiring, but if he wants to expand, the moles that I bribed will have a chance to enter.

“As for bribing the members of the Black Star Mercenary Group, I haven’t begun doing so. Without being certain of their backgrounds and having enough information, I wouldn’t know which mercenary is the most likely to be bribed. I do not wish to alert them.”

Degulish’s eyes glowed, and he laughed coldly. “Very good. This is a plan to kill two birds with one stone. We will be able to infiltrate both the Black Star Mercenary Group and Floating Dragon Island.”

The meeting then continued. Regarding the threat of the Dragon Emperor, Degulish only informed his troops to leave Planet Aquamarine and did not give any other orders. He felt that those measures were sufficient. Even if Ames was powerful, she would not be able to affect the plan that they had designed over many years. The most important thing was for them to carry out their plans.

What Degulish did not know was that the situation had already changed. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

He still thought that he had plenty of time... the whole of DarkStar still felt so.

...

The fleet escorting Nagakin had returned to Godora’s mother planet. This was a large planet that was more than ten times the size of Planet Golden Gate. Tens of defensive satellites surrounded the planet, and the security was extremely tight.

As the spaceship landed, the officers of the War Bureau who had already received news were waiting by the dock. The moment Nagakin disembarked from the spaceship, they all walked over to welcome him.

“How’s the item?”

“Perfectly fine.”

“Great, we don’t have any time to waste. Head to the research department immediately.”

Nagakin walked toward the research facilities under the guard of a large number of troops and two other Calamity Grade Supers. The roads toward the research facility were completely locked down, and no one was allowed to pass. Even the leader of Godora did not have the authority to enjoy such a treatment.

Nagakin walked over to the research lab carefully and successfully handed the Mutation Source over to the researchers. They would research the antidote for the Mutation Source at a location with the highest possible security and confidentiality. A leak was absolutely not allowed to happen.

As the key personnel who facilitated the trade between Black Star and Godora, he was allowed to wait for the results of the test. After waiting for half a day in the waiting room, he finally received news about the initial tests on the Mutation Source.

This item was indeed the source of the Mutation Disaster!

With the sample that Nagakin had brought back, the speed of developing the antidote would be increased rapidly.

“That’s great...” Nagakin could finally be at ease. He had been extremely worried that the sample that Han Xiao had handed to him was useless.

“Amazing job!” The War Bureau head slapped Nagakin on the back.

“I didn’t do anything. It is all Black Star’s contribution.” Nagakin laughed bitterly. He had never imagined that the key point to breaking them out of their current situation would actually be an outsider.

A bright smile could be seen on the head of the War Bureau’s face, which was always solemn all year round. He was like a blooming chrysanthemum flower, be it in terms of shape or color.

“Indeed. Black Star has given us a huge surprise. I really never thought that a mercenary would be one to resolve our emergency.”

After pausing for a while, he then said in a solemn tone, “This piece of news must be kept confidential, lest DarkStar comes up with another sinister scheme. It would be best if we can maintain the current situation.”

In order to deal with the numerous attacks of DarkStar, all the departments of Godora were busy to the point where they did not even have time to sleep. The sudden aid from Han Xiao had truly surprised the whole of Godora’s upper echelons, and even the highest leader of Godora paid attention to Black Star and even wanted to personally thank him.

The War Bureau had simulated their current circumstances, and the result left many of them in cold sweat.

If DarkStar had been allowed to continue behaving without any restraint, the situation would only have become worse. If the situation persisted for a year or two, Godora’s progress would have been greatly delayed, and the entire Godoran Civilization would have taken a step back. The accomplishments of the Garton Star System that they had built up over the years would also go to waste. The worst situation would be an internal fracture within Godora.

Because they knew what the outcome could have been, the upper echelons of Godora were extremely excited! Black Star providing them with the sample would allow them to avoid massive losses, save countless citizens, and turn the entire situation around!

Han Xiao had become the biggest savior in the eyes of the upper echelons.

“Black Star is an important character from Floating Dragon Island. We can treat his aid as aid from Floating Dragon. Ames seems to place a great deal of importance on him... Perhaps we will gain some benefits from this misfortune and have the opportunity to befriend an organization like Floating Dragon Island.”

The head of the War Bureau was extremely excited, and his eyes were glowing as he slapped Nagakin on the back again. “Black Star’s strength is out of our imaginations, and you must maintain contact with him. If you can, it would be best to take your relationship to the next step.”

Nagakin’s mouth began to twitch as he asked, “Take the next step, meaning...”

“Make use of our advantage as Godorans and become his best friend!” the War Bureau head said with a serious expression.

Nagakin silently raised his fists, and a golden flame covered it.

“Don’t think I won’t dare to beat you up because you are my superior.”

...

Ever since Ames landed on the planet, the atmosphere had become extremely odd.

Be it the players, refugees of the Sanctuary, mercenaries, or Godorans, they were all extremely curious about Ames. Ames also did not intend to hide anything, and her actions were for everyone to see. Han Xiao was also always beside her.

Han Xiao naturally did not mind being Ames’ tour guide. After all, he was extremely free, and for the Dragon Emperor to make a personal appearance, he naturally had to show her some hospitality.

Ames was mainly interested in the players. However, in consideration for the fact that she was on Han Xiao’s home planet, she acted in a low-profile manner and did not dissect the players as she wished.

Those from the Sanctuary would often see the two of them walking down the streets together, and when they thought about the hot rumors spreading around, their gazes could not help but become strange.

As Han Xiao noticed the odd gazes of those around him, while he did not display any expression, he was extremely speechless.

The brains of his officers must have been flooded with water. To think that they would actually dare spread rumors about him and Ames... While he was not bothered about such rumors, this was not necessarily the case for Ames. If she was not happy, she would be able to easily beat up all of his subordinates who were spreading the rumors.

At that time, should he help her whack them or help her beat them up?

However, over the next few days, Han Xiao’s worries did not come true, and Ames did not react. Her expression was still the same, and she walked around with a smile on her face. If someone had told him that Ames did not notice the expressions of those around her, Han Xiao definitely would not have believed it.

Thinking about it carefully, how would an expert of such a level be affected by such silly rumors?

Han Xiao felt that he had been worried for nothing. At the same time, he was thankful that Ames could not see what was written on the forums.

The strange gazes of passersby was nothing. There were already more than a hundred fan fictions written on the forums about his ‘love and hate’ story with Ames. The content of the stories and perverseness of the characters made his hair stand on end.

The source of all of that was Bun-Hit-Dog’s newest release. He had carefully analyzed the relationship between Black Star and the Dragon Emperor. Not only did he have photos to back his stories, he had even come up with extra stories on his own.

Bun-Hit-Dog was truly talented in this respect, and even Han Xiao almost believed what he had written. All of the players exploded in excitement and chaos, and the members of Black Star’s fan club cried out in victory. The battle between the fans and flamers quickly spread to the other novice planets, and all the players from the other countries cried out for peace!

Thus far, Bun-Hit-Dog had been his publicity angel, but for the first time in his life, Han Xiao truly wanted to strangle Bun-Hit-Dog to death. Such a reporter was only interested in creating sensational news every day, creating stories out of his imagination, and twisting the truth. It was as though he was afraid that the world was not chaotic enough. If any player spread what was written on the forums and Ames ended up seeing it, was he not afraid that he would have to take responsibility‽

However, all of the ridiculous guesses aside, it could be said that Bun-Hit-Dog’s post was truly superb. Despite Han Xiao being angered without having a place to vent his anger, he had to admit that the post was excellent.

“I am truly in awe...” Han Xiao smacked his forehead. Over the next few days, he had no intentions of visiting the forums again, afraid that his blood pressure would end up shooting up.

Ames had floated around beside him for the past few days, and they went around for a walk again that day. Han Xiao calmed himself down as he looked at the walls of the Sanctuary far away. The players climbed up and down the wall like ants as they attempted to rebuild it.

A few days ago, he had instructed Herlous and Bennett to issue a mission to upgrade the Sanctuary. The upgrading process had officially begun, and the players had a new job. They fully showed off the fine tradition of being able to work hard without complaining about fatigue, doing hard labor wherever it was required.

Now that the players had a certain degree of strength, their efficiency was far higher than when they built the Sanctuary. Han Xiao estimated that they should be able to complete the upgrade of the Sanctuary within a month.

“No wonder you want to hire the Inhumans. It seems like you hold a very high status in their hearts. You definitely place great importance in them.” Ames smiled.

“There aren’t many in this world that I view with such importance. Just that few million.” Han Xiao shrugged.

The corner of Ames’ lips curled up, and after letting out a soft chuckle, she suddenly turned and looked in a direction. Han Xiao also looked over, following the direction of her gaze.

Aurora and Hila were walking past, and upon seeing the both of them, their footsteps also stopped.

Recently, Hila and Aurora had been busy checking on the infected individuals. They had only heard that Han Xiao had brought back a bigshot from the universe but had not had a chance to meet her officially.

This time, it was a coincidental meeting.

“Are they the sisters that you are talking about?” Ames looked at the two ladies.

“Yeah.” Han Xiao raised his brows.

On the other side, Hila was expressionless as she looked at Han Xiao and Ames. After pausing for a while, she then grabbed Aurora’s hand and walked over to them.
