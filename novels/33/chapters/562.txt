Hu!

The Godoran spaceship landed, and Nagakin walked up to Han Xiao.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôs the situation? Did you take care of the Mutation Source?‚Äù Nagakin asked anxiously.

‚ÄúI got rid of it,‚Äù Han Xiao replied casually while his mechanical suit was retracting.

‚ÄúNew command, begin to collapse the Mechanical Beast Guards Army.‚Äù

The next moment, the few thousand mechanical beasts transformed back into their compressed orbs and rolled over to Han Xiao‚Äôs side through an electromagnetic force.

Han Xiao then shot out a compressed orb, which transformed into a long dark red metal box that was about two meters tall. All of the compressed orbs then rolled into the box and filled it up. Following which, the box shut itself automatically, and an engraved ‚Äò001‚Äô could be seen on the box.

The box was a ‚Äòmobile army camp‚Äô, which was a necessity for those who pursued the Army Style. Different Mechanical Armies would be placed in the different army boxes, and each army box represented an army.

The serial number of the Mechanical Beast Guards Army was 001 as it was the first complete army that Han Xiao had constructed. An army box contained the compressed orbs of a single army, and the lock of the box was made from a powerful electromagnet together with the control of an AI. It was difficult to open it through any other means, and only Han Xiao was able to control it.

When the box was completely filled with compressed orbs, the box would not be able to be compressed into a compressed orb. While it would not be convenient to bring the box around, it was not too troublesome to use it. With Phillip controlling the box and the high-speed module being attached to it, Han Xiao did not have to carry the box around with him. With a single command, the army box would quickly be transported to the battlefield.

The bottom of the army box began spitting out flames, and it rapidly ascended into the sky. A door on the belly of the BlackLight Stealth opened up, and the army box was swallowed up. There was a simple maintenance room in the spaceship, and it could calculate the losses and damage to the machines. With the opponents being beasts that were far beneath Han Xiao‚Äôs strength, the losses were negligible.

The beasts were escaping in all directions, and the battle was already over. Nagakin ordered his subordinates to clean up the battlefield while he took out his detector and confirmed that the Mutation Source had disappeared completely.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great. I shall inform the upper echelons immediately that the antidote is successful!‚Äù Nagakin was overjoyed.

At that moment, the mercenary group‚Äôs spaceships also arrived, and Herlous appeared together with the rest. Han Xiao instructed them to clean up the battlefield and bring back the beast carcasses. Those carcasses were precious materials, and Emerald Grass could use them to create Genetic Medicine. While it was not of much use to him, Han Xiao would be able to earn a small fortune by selling it to the players.

Jupiter and the others did not manage to snatch the last hit and had even died once or twice instead. All of their faces were depressed as they stood nearby.

However, the other players were all extremely excited on the forums.

Right when Black Star killed the Mutation Source, the progress meter of the Main Storyline Mission on their interface had shot up, and a Mission Complete notification had popped up on their interfaces. G√™tt the latest chùíÇpters on nùíê/velbin(.)com

All the players of Planet Aquamarine received a bountiful reward from the Main Storyline Mission. While their reward differed according to their contributions, the reward that they received on average was far more than a side mission.

However, what excited the players the most was not the reward of the mission. With the Main Storyline Mission of Planet Aquamarine completed, this meant that it was time for them to enter the Galaxy!

After spending so much time on Planet Aquamarine, the only thing that could attract them now was the galaxy. In the past, they could only watch Bun-Hit-Dog‚Äôs videos to understand the galaxy, but they could personally experience it now. With the [Mutation Disaster] mission behind them, many players looked forward to the future plot and were all extremely excited.

In contrast, it was a completely different sight with the citizens of Planet Aquamarine.

Ten minutes after the end of the battle, the Sanctuary and Six Nations received news from Godora that the Mutation Source had been destroyed. Without any delay, they immediately announced this piece of news to the entire planet. All the refugees sitting in front of a television or radio received the news.

In the cities of the Six Nations and Black Phantom Sanctuary, countless individuals revealed looks of disbelief. Their faces became agitated before they began shedding tears of joy.

They had survived the calamity!

They were still alive!

The entire planet erupted into cheers!

All the cities were drowned in the joy of surviving the calamity. Some of them cried out at the top of their lungs, some danced on the streets, while others bawled with tears of joy.

The cheers of the people formed a huge wave, rushing into the sky, echoing in the horizon.

They could finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. Thinking about the calamity that their planet had faced, it had been akin to a living hell. Everything was finally over.

The citizens of Planet Aquamarine could not help but burn with hope for their future.

The upper echelons of the Six Nations and Bennett worked together and announced that Black Star was the one who had killed the Mutation Source. They tried to create the image that Black Star was the noble savior of the entire planet.

With the citizens of the planet being overwhelmed with joy, the effects of the advertisement were extremely obvious. Almost all of the refugees were filled with gratitude to Black Star.

With the calamity over, the Six Nations had to begin thinking about their future. They would still maintain their respect to Godora on the surface but had already accepted Black Star‚Äôs conditions in secret. They decided to stake it all on Han Xiao.

Han Xiao, who was still on the battlefield, naturally was not aware of the situation. While the others were cleaning up the battlefield, he walked to the side and opened up his interface.

_____________________

[Destroy the Source] has been completed!

Mission Rating: Perfect

_____________________

Killing the Mutation Source had allowed him to get the [Perfect] rating.

Han Xiao received 2,400,000 experience points, and the high rating allowed him to draw a Random Reward. Furthermore, the bonus reward gave him another chance to draw a Random Reward, making it a total of two chances. Apart from that, Han Xiao also gained a few Legendary Points.

_____________________

Planet Legendary Points (Planet Aquamarine): You put an end to the Mutation. The Mutation Source brought a calamity to Planet Aquamarine. It ruined the order of the planet and caused countless civilians to lose their lives. You killed the source that caused hatred and pain in abundance. You chased away the calamity and brought light to the planet. You saved the planet!

_____________________

Han Xiao‚Äôs current mission reward limit was extremely high, and the effect of a single Legendary Point was extremely obvious.

After taking a look at the mission reward, Han Xiao directed his attention to the first kill reward, which allowed him to draw two of the Mutation Source‚Äôs abilities. This was the greatest reward to him.

Han Xiao did not take action immediately. He first looked around and found Feidin. Without even asking for permission, he touched Feidin to his heart‚Äôs content.

‚ÄúYes, I can feel the effect of luck.‚Äù

Han Xiao rubbed his palms in excitement and began to draw his reward under Feidin‚Äôs helpless gaze.

_____________________

You have received the opportunity to draw two of the half-mature Mutation Source‚Äôs abilities.

Note: The Mutation Source is a special life form, and you are unable to draw its innate abilities. The abilities that you can draw will be adjusted accordingly.

_____________________

The abilities are adjusted indeed, Han Xiao thought to himself.

This was a common occurrence when drawing abilities. If the target was too special, some abilities would not be replicated. For example, shapeshifting, sensory organs, and emotional control were all innate abilities of the Mutation Source.

It was just like if a human player wanted to draw for the abilities of a demon. Even if a demon had a tail whip ability, a player would not draw such an ability since they did not have a tail. The hardware just was not compatible with such an ability.

When two species were too different, even if the abilities could be extracted, there would be a change in the effects. All the race specific elements would be removed, and it would be changed into a more general skill. For example, the tail whip attack of a demon might be changed into something like a heavy kick attack. It definitely would not be changed into an attack that made use of whips.

_____________________

After adjustments, the effects of the skills and talents could be stronger or weaker. The cell proliferation and energy absorption talents of the Mutation Source had been weakened after removing the special effects of the Mutation Source.

However, the appearance of those two talents was a huge surprise for Han Xiao.

The way he saw it, those two talents were the most valuable abilities of the Mutation Source. If he could obtain a single one of them, it would be considered pretty good. However, if he could obtain both together, it would be a perfect combination!

Simply put, he would be able to regain energy by being hit, and using energy would be able to recover HP. While the regeneration rate would not be as perverse as that of the Mutation Source, he had the natural advantage of having high HP! With his HP being 38,000, even a mere 28% of his HP was a huge figure. The amount of HP that he would regain was twice that of the Mutation Source!

While the other three skills were not bad, he did not even remotely consider them after seeing the other two.

Even if the two talents were weaker, they were only weaker when compared to the original. Neither of the two talents could be considered weak, and they had both reached the level of a Molding Ability. Han Xiao could not have been happier.

He had originally thought that getting one of the two talents would be a huge win and had mentally prepared himself for being unable to get even one. Who would have thought that he would actually be so lucky! Was touching Feidin really that effective?

Han Xiao could not help but look at Feidin with a burning gaze. He had the sudden urge to extract a few hundred bottles of Ability Potions from Feidin, and both Feidin and Chen Xing could not help but tremble.

Retracting his gaze, Han Xiao made his choice without any hesitation.
