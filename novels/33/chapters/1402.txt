Chapter 1403 Change and Situation

A huge space fortress floated in the universe, surrounded by wormhole hyperdrive base stations. From time to time, wormholes opened and closed, and fleet after fleet flew out.

The Siebert Fortress was located in the Carter Star Cluster at the border of the Flickering World. It was the headquarters of the Galactic Alliance Army in the Flickering World.

In order to fight against the World Tree Civilization, the three Universal Civilizations formed the Galactic Alliance Army during the preparation period and combined the forces of the explored universe. They also divided the explored universe’s various Star Fields into numbered military regions and modified them to varying degrees.

Over the past ten years, the Flickering World had been completely transformed. The five border Star Clusters were now only left with countless defensive lines and strongholds.

Not only the Flickering World which represented the first military region but even the Star Fields in the central region were also prepared for war.

After all, the situation of the World Tree invading the territory was different from the interception war. During the interception war, there was a large area behind them, so there was a limit to their worries. However, past the Flickering World was the territory, so there was no way to retreat. They had to guard against it, and the pressure was completely different.

At this moment, in the conference room on the top floor of the Siebert Fortress, countless people were gathered with solemn expressions. Not only were there the various commanders of the Galactic Alliance Army, but there were also some Beyond Grade A Association upper echelons.

A 3D star map of the Flickering World appeared on the table.

“According to the report from the frontline, the World Tree’s vanguard army is not far from the Flickering World border. It is estimated that they will arrive at the outermost defense circle in ten days. The various troops are already prepared for battle. What do you all think?”

Simon operated the star map as he spoke. He enlarged the area at the border and marked the areas that were most likely to be attacked by the World Tree.

Although the World Tree only had one set of coordinates, it would not take just one route. It would split into many vanguard teams and advance in different directions, eventually invading the Flickering World from those directions. However, the three Universal Civilizations had already expected this situation and had turned the Flickering World into a metal barrel. “We’ve been preparing for this day for more than ten years. Just fight.”

“That’s right. What needs to be prepared and discussed has been done for more than ten years. Now, it’s time to test our results.” “The World Tree’s current actions have not deviated from our predetermined situation. We just have to act according to the strategy. When they really attack, we will adjust accordingly.”

Many of the officers spoke, their fighting spirit overflowing. Simon nodded and turned to look at Han Xiao. “Your Excellency Black Star, what do you think?!

Han Xiao supported his face with his palm and said, “We have strengthened our defense and cleared the resources, the World Tree can’t snowball for the time being, so they won’t keep advancing blindly. They’ll most likely build a bridgehead base in the border area and stabilize the jump point, ready to fight a long battle with us.”

Compared to ten years ago, his appearance had not changed at all. With his extraordinary lifespan, this bit of time could not even leave a mark on him.

“That’s right,” Simon agreed. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“So, this is a test of endurance. A battle of attrition is inevitable. Let’s see who can endure it. Let’s see if we die first or if we find the World Tree’s main body first,” Han Xiao shrugged. Currently, the revival mechanism of the World Tree was still unsolvable. Han Xiao felt that the Transcendent Grade should have the power to attack the Information Form, but he could not unlock it. He could only attribute it to some prerequisites that had yet to be fulfilled.

In the past few years, the secondary dimension expeditionary army had made some progress. Although they did not find the World Tree’s main body, they had figured out the World Tree’s territory in the secondary dimension and had met the other party’s garrison many times.

Fortunately, with the protection of Harrison’s halo, they did not expose their coordinates and were safe. However, their actions were finally discovered by the World Tree Civilization. Currently, batches of Blessed Races were searching for the expedition army of the three Universal Civilizations in the secondary dimension.

However, this was unavoidable. The World Tree’s main body was protected by countless Blessed Race members and it was heavily guarded. The closer the expedition army got to the main body, the easier it was to trigger the alert. It was basically impossible to find the main body of the World Tree without alerting any guards. It was the same in his previous life. The team that actively searched for the main body of the World Tree was chased all over the world by the Blessed Race. In the end, it was Harrison’s luck that had exploded, and he passed through the security net and found the main body.

“When does the Beyond Grade A Association plan to participate in the battle?” Simon asked.

“They can participate in the battle at any time, excluding me.” Han Xiao narrowed his eyes. “I won’t make a move before the World Tree sends out the Tree King again.”

His advancement to the Transcendent Grade was still a secret to the World Tree. He wanted to use this opportunity to launch a surprise attack and seal another Tree King. If he rashly appeared to fight a small army, he would most likely scare the Tree Kings so much that they would not dare to appear.

Before luring out the Tree King, he did not want his cannon to hit the mosquitoes. No one had any objections. After some discussion, they quickly finished the meeting and went offline to prepare. Han Xiao turned off the remote projection and looked back at the square of the training base. In front of him was a dense crowd. All the trainees were gathered there, looking at him.

“As all of you know, the World Tree is about to invade. The training will end today. It’s time for you to use what you’ve learned.”

As Han Xiao spoke, he scanned the crowd.

After more than ten years of high-pressure training and his guidance, a new batch of Beyond Grade As had been born. There were more than forty of them. Other than the exploration era, there had never been a time in history where Beyond Grade As were born so frequently. Almost half of the members of the Black Star Army were there. Jotina successfully advanced, Nero also advanced to Beyond Grade A half a year ago, and even Lagi successfully advanced. Karlot had also advanced to Beyond Grade A early on, but Han Xiao did not allow him to appear. He was still undergoing special training, accumulating insights, and trying to trigger (Everlasting Martial Path] again to quickly reach his peak combat strength.

The trainees were in an uproar for a while. Suddenly, as though they had made an agreement, they all bowed toward Han Xiao.

Regardless of whether they had advanced to the Beyond Grade A realm or not, everyone had a solemn expression on their faces as they said in unison,

“Thank you, Your Excellency Black Star, for teaching us for the past ten years. We will remember to engrave kindness in our hearts!”

No matter what Black Star’s motive was, at least they knew how much they had benefited in the past ten years. Their gratitude toward Han Xiao was sincere.

Han Xiao accepted it calmly and waved his hand. “Report to the army.”

Everyone bowed again and boarded the spaceships that were already prepared. The spaceships turned into streams of light and disappeared from everyone’s sight.

At this moment, Kasuyi walked up from behind and sighed.

“I wonder how many of these Calamity Grade seeds will survive till the next time we meet.”

“We’ve already given them the chance. You can’t blame others for not being able to obtain the Sanctum entrance ticket in more than ten years.”

Han Xiao shook his head.

Kasuyi nodded. “It’s time for us to report. Remember to bring Aurora back. If we can’t see her, we won’t feel confident.”

“Got it.”

Han Xiao nodded and watched the Beyond Grade A Association members leave.

In comparison, the Beyond Grade As were not too nervous. With Black Star’s Sanctum Revival, their lives were guaranteed.

After more than ten years of training, many Beyond Grade As had made some improvements. Han Xiao sparred with them from time to time, and he also obtained some abilities from some of them.

After sending everyone away, Han Xiao changed into King and teleported to the Soul Terminal.

The moment he arrived-Hila, Aurora, and Feidin, who were in seclusion-sensed him.

“You’re here?”

Hila stopped absorbing the soul fragments, and an indescribable aura emanated from her body.

“You’ve improved a lot over the years.” Han Xiao looked at her with a satisfied expression.

Soul Terminal was the training ground for Hila and Feidin. After ten years of seclusion, Hila had already stepped into the peak Beyond Grade A realm, and her strength had increased tremendously. Feidin had absorbed an unknown amount of soul energy through the Soul Swapper, and he had also steadily reached the level of an upper-tier Beyond Grade A.

As for Aurora, she was unable to use the resources of the Soul Terminal, but she had received special training from Hila, and her abilities had also improved. Although she was not as strong as the two freaks—Hila and Feidin, she was still quite good.

“You’re here to take us back, right? It’s about time for the World Tree to arrive.” Hila’s eyes flashed with a fighting spirit, “I can finally fight the Tree King.”

Han Xiao ignored this battle maniac and turned to Aurora. “You’re our core member. Are you ready?”

“Don’t worry, I won’t fail this time!”

Aurora clenched her fists with determination.

Although she still remembered that dream, she had already sworn not to fall for it again.

Han Xiao smiled and rubbed her head before looking at Feidin.

“You’re already an upper-tier Beyond Grade A Super. Using this power to activate the Soul Swapper is enough to cause a large area of damage to the members of the World Tree. You have a lot of freedom in this.”

The Soul Swapper was a mass killing machine, and its power was not inferior to psionic waves. It was also a treasured military tool, and when it was inconvenient for him to attack, Feidin would be able to replace him to deal large area damage to the fleet.

“I understand.” Feidin rubbed the surface of the Soul Swapper and nodded.

Although he did not like killing, he would not show mercy to invaders like the World Tree.

Han Xiao then changed into another King and teleported to the Underworld. He immediately saw Evans, and EsGod, who was teaching him combat skills.

As soon as he saw Han Xiao, Evans immediately stopped practicing and walked up to him.

Han Xiao cut to the chase and said, “The World Tree is coming. Come with me.” “Okay.” Evans nodded.

EsGod walked over with his hands behind his back and said, “Don’t die on the battlefield. I’m still waiting for you to fulfill my dream. Although the Sanctum Revival is good, as long as you die once, your ability will be lost, and you will never be able to reach the Transcendent Grade. Don’t blame me for giving up on you when that happens.”

“Don’t worry, Teacher. I won’t die so easily.”

Evans replied with confidence.

As the saying goes, having a senior is like having a treasure. EsGod had roamed the universe for many years, and he was extremely experienced. With his wholehearted guidance, Evans had already accumulated a lot of combat skills.

When he first advanced and obtained the (Energy Control] Esper Ability, Evans was at most an ordinary person with a firearm in his hands. Now that he had received EsGod’s teachings, he was like a soldier who had completed all the special force’s elite classes and was proficient in all weapons. His combat ability had increased many times.

After more than ten years of interaction, Evans already saw EsGod as his teacher. Although EsGod did not admit it, he did not reject this title. “Follow me.”

Han Xiao raised his brows and left with Evans without saying anything.

EsGod watched as the two of them disappeared, and a faint smile appeared on his face.

The three Universal Civilizations intensely prepared for battle. Ten days passed in the blink of an eye, and the World Tree Vanguard Army finally arrived at the border of the Flickering World.

Just as the Military Strategy Department had expected, the World Tree invaded from different directions, but they were all within the range of the defense circle. Battles broke out in many areas at the same time. In all the battlefields, the individual strengths on both sides restrained themselves. The Beyond Grade As of the three Universal Civilizations had only probed a few times, but the World Tree Civilization had never sent any Beyond Grade As to fight.

Having learned from the Heart Tree King’s case, the World Tree was extremely wary of Black Star and did not use any Beyond Grade As for the first wave of attacks.

In this first battle that occurred after a gap of ten years, the three Universal Civilizations, which had been preparing for a long time, successfully gave the World Tree Army a head-on blow. They did not allow the World Tree to step into their territory, and both sides were in a stalemate at the Flickering World border.

However, even after winning once, the three Universal Civilizations did not feel any joy, because this was only the first wave of probing attacks. The World Tree did not use much of its strength, and the situation was still dire.

Just as Han Xiao had said, the World Tree was prepared for a battle of attrition. The first thing it did was to build a large number of bridgeheads outside the Flickering World border.

Because of the World Tree’s continuous advancement, the jump points were all under their control. The three Universal Civilizations were currently unable to replicate the spatial anchoring orbits which were used during the interception war, and they could not chase away the enemy. They could only defend their territory and endure the waves of attacks from the World Tree. Going forward, this would be the situation of the war, and it was also a situation that the three Universal Civilizations had long been prepared for.
