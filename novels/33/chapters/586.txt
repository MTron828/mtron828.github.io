Chapter 587: Berserk Ape

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

In the machinery modification room...

‚ÄúThe core module is complete. Running an automatic scan... Automatic scan complete. Everything is in working order. Assembling the periphery modules...‚Äù

Ten or so mechanical arms quickly assembled the various parts of the mechanical suit, and a holographic screen displayed the various stats of the mechanical suit.

Phillip played the role of an assistant throughout the entire assembly process and used his superior processing speed to oversee the entire process. He detected all the microscopic defects within the various parts so that Han Xiao could make continuous adjustments and ensure perfection to raise the grade of the product.

Above the purple grade was the pink rare grade. The higher the quality of a machine, the more difficult it was to increase its grade. However, a problem that could be solved by money was not a problem at all.

Han Xiao spent more than 100,000 Enas on the core materials, and he had even made use of the pink grade void dragon bone in the mechanical suit. With so many rare materials being used, it was extremely simple to increase the grade of the final product. When comparing two different equipment of the same level, the difference between the pink and purple grade was not small at all.

Now that he was in the Calamity Grade, he had abundant Mechanical Force, and his Machinery Affinity was also raised. Together with the aid of all his talents and skills, Han Xiao‚Äôs construction efficiency was increased a great deal. Even if he was constructing a high-grade mechanical suit, it did not take him too much time.

Whoosh!

The mechanical arms quickly assembled the remaining modules of the mechanical suit, and after the assembly was complete, the mechanical arm sprayed out a chilly gas that had the ability to cool down and combine the modules. This was the final step.

The white cool gas dissipated in all directions, and a black and gold mechanical suit was displayed before Han Xiao.

Han Xiao then pressed his finger on the chest portion of the mechanical suit and released a trace of Mechanical Force to activate the suit.

Suddenly, waves seemed to have appeared on the surface of the mechanical suit, and countless black Nano Robots sprung to action. The various modules of the thin mechanical suit began to surface, and the mechanical suit bulged out as though it had put on a great deal of muscle.

Han Xiao made use of the [Super Nanometer Force] on the new mechanical suit, and there were many nano machines in the mechanical suit that had the properties of a memory alloy. The information of the various weapon modules were programed into these nano machines, and these nano machines could transform into different weapons at any time. While the design of the mechanical suit seemed simple, it was actually filled with weapons all over and had many different functions.

Apart from that, these nano machines had the ability to self-repair, produce energy, and many other functions.

‚ÄúThis mechanical suit is much more powerful than Void Dragon and is the most powerful mechanical suit that I have created to date...‚Äù

Han Xiao opened the interface and looked at the attributes of the mechanical suit.

Compared to his previous mechanical suits, the greatest difference would be the different class of the suit. In the past, the snake and dragon series belonged to the ‚ÄòLight Battle Mechanical Suit‚Äô class, but the Berserk Ape belonged to the ‚ÄòNano Transforming Mechanical Suit‚Äô class. It had the ability to transform and did not need additional components to be mounted.

In fact, many of the transforming mechanical suits were of the ape series. Could it be that the origins of this suit were the Saiyan ape?

The new mechanical suit was extremely powerful, and it met Han Xiao‚Äôs expectations. His mechanical suit was finally stronger than his own body, and its damage was also powerful. Furthermore, with the intergalactic engine that he had built into it, it was akin to a one-man spaceship. He would be able to attack battleships in an intergalactic battle. It was an extremely useful function.

Compressing the Berserk Ape into a compressed orb, Han Xiao hung it around his neck. He could not help but feel his hands turn itchy, and he was looking forward to finding someone to spar with.

However, his own Officers would only be bullied by him one-sidedly, and it would not be too convenient for him to find the other Army Commanders or Godora.

‚ÄúThe ceremony is about to begin, so I‚Äôd better not create any trouble. There will be chances in the future.‚Äù

Han Xiao temporarily suppressed that urge. The new mechanical suit was only a part of his plan to upgrade his equipment. There were still various new weapons and machines that he needed to construct. When he built up his new Mechanical Army again, his combat capabilities would then reach the peak.

...

The date of the ceremony was finally decided.

Before the ceremony, Godora revealed the news of DarkStar being destroyed, and the entire Star System was shaken.

DarkStar was infamous in the Shattered Star Ring, and it had actually been destroyed! This was truly earth-shattering news!

Numerous galactic residents were completely dumbfounded. After so many years of no progress in eradicating DarkStar, Godora was actually able to get rid of DarkStar in such a secretive and thorough manner. This was truly too sudden.

Many organizations had still been guessing what kind of a storm DarkStar would kick up next and were shocked by the news.

Godora only revealed a simple report of the process and would only announce the entire process in detail during the ceremony. It was akin to a media press conference. As such, all the citizens of the Shattered Star Ring focused their attention on Godora‚Äôs ceremony.

The galactic reporters were like sharks who smelled blood and all swarmed toward the mother planet of Godora, anxiously waiting for the beginning of the ceremony.

The galactic media agencies came to an agreement with Godora and would broadcast the entire ceremony.

As the date of the ceremony drew near, countless galactic residents became even more eager for the ceremony to begin. They truly wanted to know exactly how Godora destroyed DarkStar!

In the midst of anticipation and eagerness, the day of the ceremony finally arrived.
