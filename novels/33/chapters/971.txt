972 Nero, a Non-Tanky Mechanic Doesn“t Have a Soul

In a corner of the Dust Light Star Cluster, Teny’s fleet met a new wave of attacks. They exchanged fire with the enemy while sending their small spaceships to weave through the chaotic battlefield to engage in close combat battle.

In the previous few battles, Teny had been too obviously biased toward the Black Star Army, and in order to balance the opinions of the other organizations, he decided to let the Black Star Army take on the role of facing the enemy. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

In the chaotic battlefield, a battleship nimble weaved through the Primordial Psionic Energy explosions.

In the battleships, many different squads were awaiting their orders in the charge cabin. Nero’s squad was also a part of this battleship.

The interior of the charge cabin was gray with a red light blinking over their heads, dying their faces red. Nero’s team was seated across two rows with their backs facing a magnetic plate. The backs of their uniforms also had a magnetic plate on them so that they could stabilize their bodies.

The charge cabin was trembling under the intense maneuvers of the battleship, and Nero’s face turned slightly pale.

The captain who was clad in a heavy armor mechanical suit patted Nero’s shoulders and said, “Little brat, don’t worry. The mobility of our ship far exceeds our enemy. They won’t be able to hit us.”

Trouble usually befalls someone who says something like this... Nero could not help but curse in his heart.

The academy had a charge cabin module, and Nero was extremely clear about the things that he needed to take note of. However, he could not help but be nervous when being placed in an actual battle.

“This is our first time fighting together since you entered our squad. Let’s see your true strength and don’t hold us back.” The captain chuckled.

“Alright.” Nero let out a deep breath and clenched his fists.

Waiting in the charge cabin was an extremely tortuous thing. Time seemed to drag on for a long time, but an announcement was eventually made in the charge cabin.

“Locking on to the target. The charge cabin will be launched in forty-five seconds! Please get ready for battle! I repeat, please get ready for battle!”

A countdown timer then appeared on the screen of the charge cabin. Nero felt as though his heart had stopped, and his teammates all had nervous looks on their faces.

The captain cleared his throat and said with a deep voice, “This is the final chance to check your equipment!”

All of them were already prepared, but they still checked through their equipment once more. Nero had also activated his mechanical suit’s self-check feature.

His mechanical suit was personally modified by him and forged from many different rare materials. It was even stronger than the mechanical suit provided by the Black Star Army.

Although Nero could obtain a more powerful mechanical suit forged by other Mechanics, he preferred to research new blueprints.

This mechanical suit was similar to the Mountain Ape suit that Han Xiao had used before. However, Nero did not have that high a skill and could only make a simplified version of the suit that he called ‘Iron Ape’. It was a suit that specialized in close combat battles.

As a normal paper Mechanic, Nero was naturally concerned about his close combat abilities. Under Han Xiao and Mia’s influence, Nero also had a thing for hand to hand combat.

Nero was currently Grade C+, but with his [Perfect Mechanical Sense] and the various Mechanic talents that he had obtained over the years, his strength could reach Grade B, and the equipment that he forged exceeded his own grade.

“Get ready. Ten, nine, eight...”

Hearing the captain’s roar, Nero took a deep breath and prepared to go into battle.

Boom!

He could feel a powerful propulsion force, and the charge cabin was launched.

The coordinates of their target were indicated on the screen, and they were rapidly approaching it.

Bang!

The charge cabin suddenly trembled, and they successfully smashed into the interior of an enemy battleship.

The doors to the charge cabin opened up, and a long passageway greeted then. Without any hesitation, they charged out with their captain to clear up the enemies.

Enemy reinforcements came quickly, and their squad met with a large number of enemies.

All the warriors of the Kunde Race had accepted gene modification. Although they were not Supers and did not have different abilities, their physiques were powerful, and they had the strength of an individual around Lv.25 – Lv.45. They were roughly in between Grade E and Grade D, so they were not too weak.

Their squad was trapped in the center of the passageway with the enemy reinforcements flooding in from both directions and opening fire at them.

Nero had already thrown out a compressed orb that transformed into a mini fortress to protect the squad. It was able to block the heavy fire coming from both directions while their squad returned fire from within the fortress.

“Good job, brat.” The captain praised Nero before giving an order to his vice captain. “Break through from the enemy encirclement. I will be in charge of the front, and you will be in charge of the rear. Nero, release your artillery towers and mechanical soldiers behind to provide cover for us.”

As he said that, the captain charged out from the fortress and charged forward while enduring enemy fire. His advantage of being a Super was his superior combat strength.

Nero then threw out a large number of compressed orbs, which transformed into various artillery towers.

Tuk tuk tuk!

The artillery towers opened fire in both directions to provide cover for his squad.

Under the boost of his Mechanical Force, the strength of his long-distance weapons was terrifying. The armor and shields of the Kunde Race warriors were immediately torn apart, and body fluids spewed in all directions.

He instantly killed a large number of enemies, and a gray fog entered the death mark on the back of Nero’s hand. This was a gift that Hila had given him a long time ago. The more he killed, the greater the increase to his mental strength. This was Nero’s first time making use of this mark.

With the support of his firepower, his squad mates easily broke through the formation of the Kunde Race warriors and began slaughtering them.

Many of his squad mates were impressed with Nero’s strength.

“This newbie is truly powerful.”

“Is an ordinary Grade C Mechanic so powerful?”

“This little brat has some abilities.”

Their squad pushed on, and the enemy reinforcements charged at them without any concern for their own lives.

As a Pugilist, the attacks of the captain were extremely powerful. Even if his attacks were not able to break through an enemy’s armor, his Pugilist flames would seep into the armor and kill the Kunde Race warriors.

Nero was not used to the sight of bodies littered all around. Even with the filtration device of his mechanical suit, he could still smell the blood in the air.

The Kunde Race’s fearlessness truly shocked Nero. However, he and his squad mates would not hold back, and the Kunde Race warriors were only sacrificing their lives for nothing.

This was the first time he had felt the nervousness from killing. He would not pity the enemy, and the army had also educated them in this regard.

At the same time, Nero also felt a tinge of excitement. He did not wish to be the one providing cover fire all the time.

As a Black Star Class Mechanic, he was itching to engage in hand to hand combat but was afraid of being scolded by his squad mates.

Right at this moment, the scream of his squad mate could be heard over the communication channel.

The Kunde Race warriors had surrounded this Black Star Army warrior, and the shield of his squad mate was destroyed. At the same time, his armor was also badly damaged, and black smoke could be seen coming out from it. He took a few steps back from the impact of the attacks and was temporarily dazed.

The Kunde Race warriors in the surroundings then unsheathed their daggers and charged forward.

This squad mate of his was a Grade C Pugilist who had a powerful body. He struggled to send a few of the enemies flying, but the enemies continued to charge forward fearlessly. He had already been stabbed a few times by the enemy.

The squad mates in the surrounding wanted to turn around and help him, but a black figure charged out from behind to send all these Kunde Race warriors flying. It was Nero, who had been itching for a fight.

The surrounding Kunde Race warriors attacked Nero, and Nero’s combat panel displayed the trajectories of their attacks. He then dodged according to the instructions of the screen, and the enemy’s daggers created sparks whenever they collided with his mechanical suit.

Nero unsheathed a blade and brandished it without restraint, cutting through the enemies’ armor like it was tofu.

After helping his squad mate resolve the danger, Nero did not have the heart to return back to a shooter but charged into the enemy formation to slaughter the enemies.

Nero had a sense of satisfaction as he witnessed the enemies dying under his blade.

Indeed, a real Mechanic should fight in hand to hand combat! This is the true style of a Mechanic!

Upon seeing this scene, the captain had a strange look on his face.

Although he knew that Nero might be the strongest individual in the squad, they had never fought side by side before and were not familiar with each other’s abilities.

Upon seeing Nero killing enemies like he was dicing vegetables, the captain thought to himself, Why would a Mechanic like you want to charge into a close combat battle? Where did this bad habit come from?

In the face of a group of Supers, the Kunde Race warriors in the spaceship had no way to fight back, and the enemy troop was wiped out quickly.

Bluish green blood sprayed across the command room, and every enemy in the battleship had been killed.

Nero recovered his compressed orbs and seemed to be in a daze.

Upon seeing that, the captain walked over to Nero’s side and patted him on the shoulders. “Good work just now. How do you feel? Are you used to fighting yet?”

“I... I am much better now.” Nero waved his arms. After a battle, he was no longer as nervous as before.

Although he had been extremely nervous at the start, his mental state got better as the battle went on, and he felt extremely comfortable in battle.

He did not really feel discomfort from killing. First, it was because the enemy was of a different species. Second, a Super had a certain degree of mental resilience and could easily accept cruel scenes. Third, his mental state would change after having strength in his hands.

“It’s your first time after all. You will get used to it soon,” the captain said casually. “You can find me for free counselling if you aren’t feeling comfortable.”

“Thanks, but I won’t need it.”

Nero smiled and was a little moved. After this battle, he could not help but feel a sense of camaraderie with his squad mates.

...

Nero’s first combat experience went smoothly, and he had more confidence than before. Not too long after the battle started, the Kunde Race fleet was defeated, and the dynasty’s fleet began clearing up the battlefield.

In the main flagship, Teny looked at the intact Black Star Army battleships returning to the fleet and nodded.

The Black Star Army did not have too many casualties, and he was extremely satisfied. As the fleet commander, he had many ways to reduce the casualties of the Black Star Army. He planned to do this to repay Han Xiao’s favor.

Beep beep!

Right at this moment, his communicator rang.

Teny then took a look, and his expression changed slightly. He picked up the call with a respectful tone.

“Your Excellency Black Star, I was still planning to pay you a visit after the war but never expected you to contact me first.”

“It has been a long while since we last talked, and I have something to trouble you with.” Han Xiao was the one who called.

“What do you need?” Teny did not like beating about the bush and went straight to the point.

“I heard that you want to protect the Black Star Army fleet?”

“That’s right.” Teny nodded.

“Ah, this is what I want to trouble you with. You don’t have to protect my men too much. I sent them into the battle so that I can train them.” Han Xiao smiled.

“Alright then. I understand.” Teny did not say too much after hearing that. Since their master had spoken, he naturally would not reject.

“Also, I hope that you can take care of this person...”

Han Xiao then sent Nero’s information to Teny and said with a smile, “This brat is my student, and I want to train him. If it is convenient, try to give him a few more combat opportunities. Also, don’t find it strange if he meets some unexpected situation. It is just my training.”

He felt that he still had some conscience for not interfering with Nero’s first battle.

However, he would take action after this and thus informed Teny first.

Teny looked at the information and nodded. “Alright, I will make the relevant arrangements.”

“I will have to trouble you then. I will be waiting for you in the Garu Star Cluster after the war. We can have a good chat then.”

“Okay.”

The call ended, and Teny looked through Nero’s information while muttering under his breath, “Black Star’s student... I will have to arrange it properly then.”

...

At the same time, another dynasty fleet had just ended their battle and had just cleaned up the battlefield.

The commander went to rest and got his vice commander to handle the other matters. Gaud, who was the commander’s aide-de-camp, also had some time to rest.

Gaud returned to his room and took off his uniform for a shower.

After his shower, Gaud walked in front of the mirror and looked at his own body.

Fair skin, skinny figure, ordinary looks...

Looking at the mirror, Gaud touched his face, and his lips curled up with a smile.

“It’s truly good to be young.”
