Chapter 798 Dynasty Mother Plane

“Welcome to the Central Galaxy, Your Excellency Black Star.”

I’m here, at the center of the universe...

As the area announcement sounded, this strange-looking fleet slowly advanced. The fleet’s main ship received a communication request. An officer wearing the dynasty’s high-level army uniform appeared on the screen. He had a small mustache and looked highly intelligent.

“I’m the commander of the dynasty mother planet’s Guard Team 17, here on orders to welcome the dynasty’s ally.”

Han Xiao’s brows rose as he sized him up. This commander was not someone famous, but Han Xiao was somewhat familiar with him. In his previous life, when the players traveled to the dynasty’s mother planet, they had to go through many inspections before the mother planet’s guard team brought them through. These people were like the gatekeepers, so the players were familiar with all of them.

“Thanks,” Han Xiao said.

“Please follow me.”

Then, the guard team turned around and headed to the mother planet. The fleet followed behind.

Ames suddenly turned and asked Han Xiao, “This is your first time here at the Central Galaxy, right?”

“Hmm.” Han Xiao did not deny it. He knew the Central Galaxy like the back of his hand, but on paper, this was his first time there.

“Then let me tell you about it...” Ames shook her head. She used to occasionally visit the Central Galaxy to sightsee while also searching for Aesop, so she was quite familiar with it. Since Black Star had never gone before, she felt that she had to help Han Xiao know more about the situation here.

Listening to Ames talking about the Central Galaxy, Han Xiao felt a little strange, as if he was a farmer entering a big city for the first time.

“Unlike the other Star Fields, here in the Central Galaxy, the three civilizations rule over all the Star System and the Star Cluster civilizations,” Aesop added while Ames was speaking. “In the other Star Fields, the various civilizations are on different sides, while here they’re all on one side. The security here is the safest in all the Star Fields. Other than some brutes that are on EsGod’s level, there are close to no galactic pirates or wanderers here. They are eliminated as soon as they’re discovered by the three civilizations.”

Han Xiao nodded. The three civilizations ruled over the Central Galaxy. This was their headquarters and was basically under their complete control. Maintaining the law was equivalent to maintaining their own ruling, so they were not going to allow any disruption.

The two fleets left the stargate station and stopped.

The commander of the mother planet guard team said, “Please wait a moment. I will now open a path for everyone and bring you guys to the mother planet.

Then, the mother planet guard team’s battleships shot out blue and green beams, which formed a dot far away. A blue and green ring gradually expanded from it and turned into a teleportation gate-looking path. The inside of the gate was bright green.

“This path is for you guys to safely pass through the Psionic Seal Ring of the mother planet. Your spaceships will receive a coating once you enter the path, so you won’t be obliterated by the Psionic Seal Ring,” the mother planet guard team commander explained.

The Psionic Seal Ring was like layers of shielding covering the mother planet, protecting it against all kinds of Planetary Obliteration attacks.

This was not just a regular shield. It covered around half of the entire Crimson Ring Star System. Only universal civilizations could build something this grand.

The coating was one of the advanced application methods of energy. Different coatings were like different passwords, and the wrong coatings would not be allowed into the various Psionic Seal Rings. It was like a security pass and a key.

As the fleet entered the light green gate, a thick, colorful coating covered all the spaceships. The guard team followed behind, and the gate closed after them.

The guard team led the way ahead. The two fleets turned into streams of light and advanced following the safe path.

On the ship, Teny started to chat casually with Han Xiao about his mother planet.

“The Psionic Seal Ring was built during the exploration era war. Back then, it was to protect against the Planetary Obliteration attacks from the other civilizations. The cosmic space inside the ring can be considered a completely sealed new world. During the war, the scientists adjusted the physical constants inside, all for the sake of safety. When the time of peace came, these altered physical constants became a form of contamination. It took quite a lot of effort to fix them and make the sealed world that the mother planet was in return to a normal cosmic space...”

“The three civilizations’ technology is so much more advanced than before.” Aesop caressed his beard as he spoke. “With the concentration of resources, talents, and technology, their development speed far exceeds those beyond Star Cluster civilizations. The gap between them is growing constantly. I wonder what can even shake your rule nowadays.”

Han Xiao scratched his nose and did not say anything.

This time, the two fleets passed by an area. Through the porthole, Han Xiao could see a cluster of dark blue light faraway.

Seeing Han Xiao look over, Teny explained, “That’s a cluster of Primordial Psionic Energy. If we get close, we will be assimilated and devoured. That’s one of the defense measures of the Psionic Seal Ring.”

After flying in hyperdrive for two days, the spaceship trembled suddenly and finally left the Psionic Seal Ring. In their sights, a sesame-sized dark red planet appeared.

“That’s the dynasty’s capital, the Crimson Ring Star Group. Planet Crimson Ring is the main planet. There are sixteen satellites and sixty large government life stations around it, as well as many space bases. The total population is 470 billion,” Corbus said with pride.

Han Xiao tutted and said, “The house price there must be very high.”

“That’s right... but your focus is a little odd.” Corbus’ lips twitched. I was talking about how marvelous the mother planet is, and you asked me if the house price there is high? Are we even talking about that‽

As the fleet moved closer, they started to see the details of the Crimson Ring Star Group.

Planet Crimson Ring was extremely large. The people of the Crimson Dynasty had artificially modified the size of their mother ship. The sixteen smaller satellites orbited around it. These natural satellites had been moved there by the dynasty using their technology to offset the gravitational pull so the mother planet’s habitable area would be enlarged. The planet’s surface was filled with buildings.

There were also many large life stations and space fortresses around.

“The capital of a universal civilization, it is indeed marvelous to look at,” Ames complimented softly. This was her first time there at the capital of the Crimson Dynasty, and it was thanks to Han Xiao.

“When I was still one of the Ancient Ones, I did come once before, but I did not have as grand an entrance as you.” Aesop sighed. “I wonder if the national pillars of the Crimson Dynasty still remember me. I only met them once.”

Following the orders, the fleet parked at a space port. The members of the Black Star Army remained in the ships while Han Xiao and the others took the spaceship prepared by the Crimson Dynasty toward Planet Crimson Ring.

He deliberately decided not to bring the players. The players possessed too many uncertainties, so things might get out of hand if they caused any trouble there. Furthermore, if he took the Shattered Star Ring players there, he might not be able to take them back.

As they approached Planet Crimson Ring, the buildings on the surface became gradually clearer. The Crimson Dynasty was known to be strict, hardworking, and pragmatic. Compared to the Federation of Light and the Arcane Church, the cultural aspect of the dynasty was not as advanced. Their architectural aesthetic was focused on sharpness, bulkiness, and symmetry. The main colors used were red, black, and metallic gray.

Hu!

The spaceship slowly landed outside a huge city. The sunlight from the artificial Fixed Star coated the upright buildings with a layer of gold. This was the main city of the dynasty’s mother planet, Tarunamir Palace, the power center of the entire dynasty.

A group of receptionists were waiting at the docks. They approached and said, “Your Excellency Black Star, we’re responsible for welcoming you. Please follow me to Tarunamir Palace’s Dynasty Reception Center to rest for a day. The dynasty’s leader will personally meet you tomorrow.”

“Okay.” Han Xiao had no objection. He then looked at Teny and the group of the dynasty elites and said, “What about you guys?”

Teny shook his head. “We have to report to the army.”

Han Xiao nodded before casually summoning a set of Beyond Grade A orange-grade hovering guards to give to Teny.

“For you to protect yourself, I don’t know when we will meet next. Keep in contact.”

Teny was stunned for a moment. He accepted the set of machinery and gave Han Xiao a deep look. “Okay.”

Han Xiao did not forget about the other elite officers and gave them some machinery too, showing friendliness. Mechanical weapons built by a Beyond Grade A were quite valuable to Calamity Grade Mechanics, and Han Xiao had a ton of them.

Han Xiao watched as Teny and the others left.

If not because they had gone to accept the modification, Han Xiao would not have had the chance to have close contact with them. He wondered if he would have chances like this to gain Favorability again in the future.

After the dynasty elites left, the group only consisted of Han Xiao, Ames, Aesop, Hila, and the Black Star Guards. They followed the receptionists through the military security zone and entered Tarunamir Palace.

The moment Han Xiao stepped into the city, suddenly, seven enormous waves of energy erupted and soared into the sky.

Boom!

“Hmm?”

Han Xiao narrowed his eyes and stopped his footsteps.

These seven sources of energy were all Beyond Grade A!

The seven waves only lasted for an instant before they were withdrawn. There seemed to be no provocative intention, just to showcase their own existence.

Han Xiao’s eyes sparkled. Seven Beyond Grade As... They should be the ones belonging to the dynasty itself and the allies that the dynasty had gathered.

He thought about it. This did not look like a provocation, more like a Beyond Grade A style greeting to the newcomer.

“Your Excellency Black Star, to welcome your alliance, the dynasty has gathered the National Pillars under its command,” the receptionist said at a suitable moment. “Other than those who are held back by business or are too far away, all the Beyond Grade As who are free have come. There is a total of seven of them.

“After you meet with the dynasty’s leader tomorrow, we will arrange for the various National Pillars to meet with you too.”

“National Pillars, these guys have quite a nice title.” Han Xiao smiled casually.

“What are you talking about?” The receptionist chuckled. “You, too, are now a National Pillar of our Crimson Dynasty.”

...

“That newcomer is here.”

In a certain room inside Tarunamir Palace, a few people with various appearances sat on the sofa and looked in Han Xiao’s direction with interest. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Didn’t respond.”

“Looks like it’s his first time seeing so many Beyond Grade As together, so he doesn’t know the rules.”

“It’s only normal since he’s from the Shattered Star Ring.”

“Hmm? The woman beside him is a Beyond Grade A, too.”

“The Dragon Emperor, Ames, I know her.”

“The old man beside looks familiar too... Hey, that guy seems to be one of you guys, the Ancient Ones in the past. The one that knows prophecy.”

“It is him. I remember.”

“Hehe, this new ally seems quite interesting.”

“The Evolution Cube is in his hands. Don’t be excessive tomorrow. I still want to borrow it.”
