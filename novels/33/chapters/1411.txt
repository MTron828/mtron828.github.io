Chapter 1412 Change

At the expeditionary army outpost.

An exploratory fleet was docked at the dock. Harrison and his teammates alighted from the spaceship, took off their life-preserving helmets before taking a deep breath.

“I’m dying of suffocation. The air in the base’s large ecological shield is still the best. In the past few days outside, the gas filters of the spaceships have all become smelly.”

“Really? Why don’t I feel anything?” “I wonder if it’s because us Gukates have a better sense of smell than most galactic species?”

“It’s a pity that I didn’t gain anything from this trip.”

Hearing his crewmates engage in idle chatter, Harrison rubbed his forehead in frustration.

Ever since he unearthed this ally, the Realmless King, the upper echelons had allowed him to lead an expedition team alone. From a follower to a team commander, he had a certain degree of freedom to make exploration plans.

Black Star had always said that Harrison was lucky, and Harrison was willing to believe that it was true. He secretly hoped that his luck would help him find the World Tree’s main body and end the war as soon as possible. However, after so many years, the luck that he had high hopes for seemed to have become dormant. Other than escaping from the pursuit of the World Tree’s Blessed Race a few times, he did not have any new achievements in exploring

Now that the expeditionary army’s exploration progress had come to a standstill, Harrison was both anxious and worried. As the saying went, if one walked by the river all the time, one’s shoes would inevitably get wet. The expeditionary army kept wandering around the territory of the World Tree, and they met their pursuers time and time again. He felt that there might come a time when they would fail.

At this moment, one of the team members patted Harrison on the shoulder and said, “Captain, how long do we rest this time before we start the next exploration?”.

“Ten days,” Harrison replied.

“Got it. Let’s go to the base cafeteria for lunch. Want to come?”

“No, I’ll report to the logistics department and have them repair and maintain the spaceship. I still have to write a routine report.” Harrison waved his hand.

“Alright, we’ll bring you some food. What do you want to eat?”

“Then I want...”

Harrison was just about to say something when he suddenly stopped. At that moment, a chilling feeling gripped his heart.

Without getting an answer, the team member blinked in confusion and asked again, “Why aren’t you saying anything? What do you want to eat?”

Harrison’s mind was in a mess, and he felt a strong sense of vigilance. He could not help but look up at the scenery outside the port. “What are you looking at?” The team member turned his head and followed Harrison’s gaze. The only thing he saw was the dim yellow light of the setting sun in the secondary dimension. It was like an oil painting with the aura of history, but he did not see anything unusual.

“Something’s not right...”

Harrison became warier.

The team member wanted to ask more, but at this moment, the dimension barrier in the distance suddenly lit up with a blue light and quickly turned into a huge space vortex. It was as if a hole had been torn open, and the green and lustrous World Tree Blessed Race swarmed out like locusts, covering the sky and covering the earth. They were like tiny green dots that quickly enlarged in everyone’s vision.

“Wuwuwu-Alert! The space barrier has been broken! Enemy attack!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

An ear-piercing alarm suddenly resounded throughout the base. All the expeditionary army members who were resting and waiting in the base jumped in shock. The sound of anxious shouts, anxious footsteps, and chaotic crashing sounds created a riotous symphony.

“Everyone, retreat at full speed! Prepare to self-destruct! The defense team will be staying behind to buy time!”

The roar of the person in charge of the outpost sounded in the communication channel. Half an hour ago, an expedition team had self-destructed and lost contact. He was still investigating this matter and was not sure if there had been any intelligence leaks. He did not expect the World Tree to arrive so quickly. The World Tree was extremely powerful in the secondary dimension, and the defense of this outpost was limited. The coordinates of the dimension had already been exposed, and if they fought head-on, it would attract more of the World Tree Blessed Race. In the preset plan that the three Universal Civilizations had planned, if this outpost was attacked, the first priority would be to self-destruct and clear the traces, while the expeditionary army would quickly retreat. Unless they had no choice, they would not choose to fight head-on.

“Let’s go!”

Harrison’s expression changed drastically, and he could not care less about anything else. He quickly called his teammates to board the dock and started the engine.

The outpost became chaotic all of a sudden, and the automatic defense team was hastily activated to fight against the endless stream of World Tree Blessed Race to buy time. Meanwhile, the expeditionary army members behind swarmed toward the warehouse and quickly found their vehicles to evacuate.

Streams of light shot out from the base and scattered to escape into different secondary dimensions.

Very soon, the vanguard troops of the World Tree Family started fighting head-on with the defense team of the outpost. In an instant, countless battleships exploded into fireworks.

At the same time, the fortresses in the outpost activated their self-destruct sequence and exploded. The gate that connected to the main material universe was also destroyed by the physical missiles fired by the base. Flames soared into the sky, black smoke filled the air, and countless debris rained down.

The defense team was quickly destroyed, and the outpost exploded violently. The same scene happened in multiple secondary dimensions. The World Tree obtained precise coordinates half an hour ago, quickly assembled, and located their destinations directly. A large-scale blitzkrieg was carried out, catching the three Universal Civilizations off guard. The bridgehead that the three Universal Civilizations had built in the territory of the Realmless King were destroyed one after another, and many expedition teams had to escape.

On the other side, the Realmless King’s residence.

A magic portal shining with green light suddenly opened, and the Secret Tree King slowly walked out. The first thing he saw was the black mountain range and the huge throne in the middle of the dimension.

However, there was no sign of the Realmless King on the throne. “Am I late? Or was it a coincidence that he’s not at home?”

Secret Tree King activated his perception magic and realized that the Realmless King was not hiding anywhere in the area. He could not help but feel a little regretful. The stabilization zone controlled by the Realmless King had some reputation in this secondary dimension area. The World Tree Blessed Race had also heard about it, but they had never paid attention to it.

When he found out from the expedition team that the three Universal Civilizations were working together with the Realmless King, the Secret Tree King had wanted to go straight to the Realmless King’s base camp and turn him into a member of the World Tree. However, he realized that the Realmless King was not at home, so he could only give up on this plan for the time being.

The Secret Tree King raised his hand and clenched his fist. Magical runes shot out and turned into a surveillance spell that took root in this secondary dimension. The moment the Realmless King returned to his base, he would come and attack again.

After casually setting up the spell, the Secret Tree King summoned the teleportation gate and stepped into it. The vortex quickly shrank and disappeared with him.

At the same time, in the secondary dimension at the edge of the Realmless King’s territory.

Space was slowly collapsing, and wave after wave of dimensional energy was being devoured by the Pivotal Snake hatchling. At the side, the Realmless King who was in charge of feeding it suddenly stopped, and his heart tightened.

He had a basic sense within the territory that he controlled. Just now, he had sensed that the World Tree Army had raided the secondary dimensions that were lent to the three Universal Civilizations one after another. Almost all the outposts had fallen, and the most terrifying thing was that an uninvited guest had arrived at his headquarters. It was obvious that their target was him.

“The World Tree still came!”

The Realmless King panicked.

Although he treated the intelligence of the three Universal Civilizations as a bargaining chip, he was not willing to reveal it to the World Tree unless he had no other choice. The risk was too high, and the World Tree was obviously targeting him now. Beyond Grade As had gone all the way to his base, and even if he expressed his willingness to cooperate, they would most likely kill him to ensure that the intelligence was reliable.

“Luckily, I came out. If I had stayed at home, I would have turned into the puppet of the World Tree...”

The Realmless King felt a sense of lingering fear, and he looked at the Pivotal Snake with a complicated expression.

When Black Star told him to take out his own territory to feed the Pivotal Snake, the Realmless King was very unhappy. Now that he looked at it, he only felt glad... If not for Black Star forcefully giving him this job, he would not have come out to walk the Pivotal Snake today, and would most likely have been trapped by the World Tree’s experts at his home.

Does that mean... Black Star saved my life?!

“Since I can’t go back, I can only walk this path to the end!”

The Realmless King quickly made up his mind.

He did not want to get involved in the war between two Universal Civilizations, but one of his trusted subordinates had already provoked the three Universal Civilizations and dragged him into it. Thus, he had no choice but to cooperate with the three Universal Civilizations. Right now, it was already too difficult for him to leave.

Since the World Tree had already set its sights on him, he had no choice but to take a stand. He had to suck up to the three Universal Civilizations and defeat the World Tree.

With this in mind, the Realmless King turned to the Mechanical Oracle monitoring the Pivotal Snake and reported the situation.

The battle did not last too long. The World Tree Family wiped out the expeditionary army outpost. The surprise attack ended very quickly, and a large number of expedition teams fled in all directions. A portion of the World Tree fleet chased after the fluctuations of the dimensional travel, while the rest of the troops had already begun cleaning the battlefield, summarizing the results of the battle, and finishing up the work.

The roots of the World Tree extended out from the spatial rift, and expeditionary army spaceships were hanging on them. The Secret Tree King was floating at the side, sharing his memories with his eyes closed.

Not long after, the Secret Tree King opened his eyes again. His originally relaxed expression was now extremely solemn.

“I didn’t expect the mother tree’s natural enemy to have fallen under the enemy’s control. The situation is dangerous...”

Eliminating the enemies that were searching for the mother tree was originally just a matter of convenience. He did not expect to find the mother tree’s natural enemy because of this. This was not good news.

If the mother tree’s natural enemy entered maturity, it would be able to sense the location of the mother tree’s main body. If it could only move independently, it would not be a big threat. However, if it was controlled by the enemy, the threat level would soar to the extreme, which meant that the enemy could find the mother tree’s main body.

The Secret Tree King knew the severity of the matter. This meant that the World Tree, which was supposed to fight a war of attrition without any pressure, had to seize whatever time they had. They had to either kill the Pivotal Snake before it reaches adulthood or completely defeat the three Universal Civilizations before then. The only good news was that the Pivotal Snake had just been born, and it would take a long time for it to reach adulthood.

He immediately sent this matter to the Ancestral Tree King. The next moment, the voice of the Ancestral Tree King sounded in his mind.

“Good job, or else we would still be kept in the dark. Summon a portion of your high-level combatants to hunt down the mother tree’s natural enemy. You must eliminate it!” “Alright, I happened to obtain the coordinates of the enemy’s territory in the secondary dimension from their memories. We have a new target.” “Hmm, the Fortitude Tree King and I will be ready to receive you at any time. I’ll leave the rest to you.” The Ancestral Tree King nodded.

“Just nice, I can successfully open up the secondary dimensional battlefield zone this time and solve both problems together.”

A cold light flickered in the Secret Tree King’s eyes. He was not satisfied with destroying the outposts of the three Universal Civilizations. What he had his eyes on was the base camp that the three Universal Civilizations had developed in the secondary dimension world for a long time. The two sides had fought for more than ten years, and only today did they grasp the general situation of the three Universal Civilizations. They were no longer led by the nose, and they finally had a breakthrough.

Exploration Universe, frontline base.

Han Xiao was listening to the battle conference when a report from the Mechanical Oracle suddenly appeared in his mind.

“Oh? The World Tree found the expeditionary army outpost and launched a surprise attack. Did they succeed?”

Han Xiao frowned. He was somewhat surprised by this, but not too surprised. As the expeditionary army’s exploration time increased, the risk of exposure also increased at the same time. He had long been mentally prepared for this, and the only thing that made him feel strange was the difference in time from his expectations.

It had only been a few days since he had returned from the expeditionary army outpost, and he was still thinking about the follow-up plan when the World Tree broke through the outpost. It seemed like a coincidence, but Han Xiao felt that there was something fishy about

it.

“The secondary dimension battlefield has in the end been established, and that is the World Tree’s home ground. Their attack this time probably allowed them to obtain the coordinates of the shallow dimensions, and this two-way battle is disadvantageous to the three Universal Civilizations... However, the three Universal Civilizations have also made preparations in the secondary dimension, so the situation will not be as bad as in my previous life.”

Han Xiao pondered. At this time, Simon, who was explaining the strategy, suddenly paused. A remote projection of a high-ranking military officer appeared on the conference table. His expression was extremely serious as he said in a deep voice,

“This is an emergency. The secondary dimension expeditionary army outpost has been raided by the World Tree, and it has almost completely fallen. Some of the intelligence has been leaked, and the World Tree has likely obtained the coordinates of the shallow dimension. It is estimated that a second front line will be opened, and we urgently need high-level combatants to help!”

The three Universal Civilizations’ notification was a step slower than the Mechanical Oracle’s. As soon as they finished speaking, all the officers present were shocked and turned to look at Han Xiao.

Hearing this, Han Xiao slowly nodded and asked,

“Who is leading the enemy?” “According to the information from the frontline, it’s a Super who has never appeared before.”

The image of the Secret Tree King appeared on the virtual screen. This was a photo taken before some bases self-destructed.

“Secret Tree King...” Han Xiao immediately recognized this person.” Alright, leave this to me.”

At this moment, Simon opened his mouth and said with a frown, “Warring on two fronts will restrict our high-level combatants. Aurora won’t be able to split herself up. At the same time, the enemy might even deliberately avoid Black Star, allowing them to use their foreign experts... I will definitely agree to assist the secondary dimensions, but the frontlines of the border are important battlefields. We have to maintain a sufficient number of advanced combatants.”

“This is not a big problem. I have enough The King mechanical suits to move quickly on both sides. Also... I have more manpower.”

Han Xiao nodded.

Compared to the terrifying scale of the galactic battlefield, the secondary dimension world was heavily divided due to its different specialties, which indirectly strengthened the importance of individual strength in the secondary dimension battlefield. It was time for the Holy Accord Organization’s hooligans, who had been idling around for decades, to come into play.

Furthermore, this Secret Tree King was worth him taking action.
