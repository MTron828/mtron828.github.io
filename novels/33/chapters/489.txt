Chapter 490: Sharp Contradiction

“What do you mean?”

“We are hidden in the dark, and Alvin’s main body won’t dare appear,” Forsyth explained. “Thus, the other party is definitely waiting for the Godoran reinforcements. Our fleet is already awaiting their orders near Noriosse, and we can apply for more motherships to be sent out. When the reinforcements of the other party arrive and attempt to collect Alvin from Noriosse, our troops can launch an ambush and destroy the enemy’s fleet. Not only will we be able to get rid of a traitor, we will also be able to get rid of a Godoran fleet.”

“You are right,” Anur said. “The port is a place that they have to pass, and it is easy to track their whereabouts. This can be a layer of insurance, but we cannot ease up. Continue to search for Alvin’s main body and give the other party pressure.”

...

Han Xiao and the others found another base. After settling down, he looked for Nagakin and Alvin to discuss their plans. However, before their discussion, a question surfaced in his mind. Why did Alvin choose to betray DarkStar? There was no information on this character from his previous life.

“Betray? I do not feel that this is a betrayal.” Alvin shook his head. “I have golden colored skin and am a Godoran. This is abandoning the darkness and entering the light. I joined DarkStar once, but it does not mean that I have to be a member of DarkStar forever.

“There are many mixed blood Godorans who are treated with prejudice and scorn. Thus, when the members of DarkStar appeared before me, I left without any hesitation. DarkStar’s hiring process is extremely strict, and it would be almost impossible for any Godoran spies to sneak in. I am naturally not a spy either.”

Han Xiao’s brows then furrowed, and he asked, “So, why have you chosen to side Godora now?”

“Because I noticed that Godora’s problem with DarkStar isn’t so simple. DarkStar has always brainwashed their members with hatred and described Godora as an extremely evil entity, as though they wished to wipe out all mixed blood Godorans. Reinforcing hatred is the same as reinforcing loyalty to them. The members of DarkStar have begun to hate Godora more and more over the years, but news of the true situation in Godora has always been restricted.”

Alvin raised his head up and sighed. “Godora’s attitude toward the mixed blood Godorans isn’t so extreme, and the government is very open. They only treat DarkStar as their enemy, and to ordinary mixed bloods, the government has always been extremely fair to protect their rights.”

Han Xiao nodded and said in a teasing tone, “I am waiting for you to say ‘but’.”

Alvin laughed bitterly as he heard that. “Alright. But... the government’s stance and policies aren’t sufficient to change the views of the Godorans. The purebloods’ disdain toward the mixed bloods is deeply rooted in tradition. While the government is able to give us the assurance of material objects, discrimination is one’s free will. The government isn’t able to control the thoughts of its people. The Godoran government wants to accept the mixed bloods, but the enemies of this policy are their own citizens and the millions of years of tradition.

“DarkStar’s presence incited greater contradiction between the people and made the purebloods discriminate against us even more. Even though terrorists like DarkStar have nothing got to do with ordinary mixed bloods, that isn’t enough to change the views of the majority. After all, not everyone is able to act rationally.

“Compared to the dangerous DarkStar, the mixed bloods living in Godora are targets for them to vent their frustration. While DarkStar claims that they are fighting for the lives of the mixed bloods, their unscrupulous means haven’t given the mixed bloods a better life but have turned it into a greater torture. As such, even more mixed bloods have been forced toward DarkStar’s side.

“This is a knot that is extremely difficult to untie. You cannot expect the purebloods to suddenly end their discrimination in a single night, and you cannot expect the mixed bloods to not have any thought of retaliation when being discriminated against. This is the fact that DarkStar is exploiting. If not for DarkStar, would the mixed bloods suffer from so much discrimination?”

Han Xiao tapped on the table with his finger and looked at Nagakin. “What do you think?”

Nagakin let out a sigh. “He is right. I do not discriminate against the mixed bloods, but I do not represent everyone. The policies of the upper echelons have always been to treat the mixed bloods with kindness and give them a fair chance to seize opportunities. However, because of DarkStar, those on top are also afraid that the mixed bloods may betray them. Thus, it is impossible for any mixed bloods to climb to a high position. You can treat it as a solidification of social class.”

“While policies may be good, a good plan may not be feasible, especially when it involves the benefits and survival of an entire race.” A thoughtful expression lingered on Alvin’s face. “Thus, I am willing to defect to Godora. Perhaps the lives of mixed bloods will only become better with DarkStar being eliminated.”

“Your ambitions are extremely noble,” Han Xiao said with respect.

“Thank you.” Alvin smiled. His tone then changed. “However, even if you praise me, I will not hand over any intel before I am completely safe.”

“Don’t say that to me; it isn’t my concern,” Han Xiao said with a smile. “You should say that to the Godorans. My mission is only to protect you.”

He then retracted his smile and said in a serious tone, “We are unable to predict DarkStar’s plans, and we currently have a few options. First, hide ourselves and observe any changes while waiting for our reinforcements. This will be the most passive plan. Second, take the initiative to attack DarkStar. Distract them so that they won’t have the energy to find your main body.

“The third option requires the agreement of you, Alvin. We can hide your main body far away from this place, and it would be best if it was on the other side of the planet. This way, your doppelgangers will all disappear. While you will suffer some injuries, DarkStar will lose all clues. I know a Teleportation Mage who lives on Noriosse, and he can help us. If not, he will definitely be beaten up by me again.

“Fourth, find a chance to leave Noriosse secretly with your main body. However, this plan is extremely risky. There is a ninety percent chance that DarkStar’s fleet is currently hiding outside the atmosphere, and leaving rashly would only cause us to fall into their net.”

Nagakin and Alvin looked at each other with hesitation.

Han Xiao then said with a deep voice, “If the two of you don’t have any other suggestions, which plan will you pick?”

With Nagakin’s personality, he leaned toward taking the initiative to attack.

However, Alvin did not want to take the risk and preferred to wait and watch.

Bang!

Before they could come to a decision, Aroshia’s body suddenly swayed, and she crashed onto the table with a loud bang.

The few of them turned over to take a look. She was currently holding onto her head with her eyes in disarray and brows furrowed as though she was in great pain.

“What’s wrong”? Han Xiao got up immediately and held onto Aroshia’s shoulders.

Aroshia rubbed her temples. “It is like... there is a voice calling out to me in my head. It seems to be getting closer to me. I can feel its position...”

Han Xiao’s brows were raised, unsure of what was going on.

...

At the same time, a black spaceship finally came out from dark space and was floating among the stars.

It had arrived from a distant star field. It had jumped through numerous stargates, almost been caught in a black hole, witnessed the explosion of a new planet, driven past an asteroid belt, escaped the chaotic tides of space, met a radiation storm, and also traveled through the most silent part of space without a single organism or planet. After a whole series of dangers, it had finally stopped. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The shiny mirror-like exterior of the spaceship reflected a planet that looked like an iron fortress.
