Chapter 1410 Hidden Change

Han Xiao did not continue to stare at the Pivotal Snake. He left an Observer’s Mark and summoned two apostles and a group of elite mechanical soldiers to act as bodyguards. Only then did he bring it back to the outpost to inform the leaders of the three Universal Civilizations.

The leaders of the three Universal Civilizations were overjoyed when they learned about the situation of the Pivotal Snake. They immediately told the expeditionary army to cooperate with the Realmless King to nurture the Pivotal Snake’s infant and provide strict protection. They also treated the Pivotal Snake’s abilities as top secret.

The Pivotal Snake’s infant was extremely wary of the outside world, but it was born with the desire to absorb more nutrients. The Pivotal Snake only calmed down a little when the Realmless King unwillingly took out a new secondary dimension to feed it. It started to absorb the dimension energy and ate obediently. Han Xiao did not leave immediately. Instead, he stayed there for a while and tried to communicate. However, the Pivotal Snake had always ignored the others, so he had no choice but to temporarily give up on the idea of gaining Favorability.

After staying in the secondary dimension world for seven to eight days, the battle on the frontlines also came to an end. The World Tree once again lost the battle, and the Flickering World border defense circle repelled the enemy. The two sides were still in a stalemate.

The results of this battle were announced by the three Universal Civilizations, and the victory at the individual strength aspect was emphasized. The galactic residents were overjoyed, and their sense of security increased greatly. Their confidence in the war increased to a certain extent.

The frontline battle report also spread to the Holy Accord Organization, causing many of the Holy Accord Revivors to exclaim.

“The strength of the Beyond Grade A Association is getting stronger. They don’t even need to use their full strength to kill a Tree King.” “I can tell that they’re much stronger than ten years ago. So remarkable. Sigh, I also wanted to participate in Black Star’s training.”

“It’s a pity we can’t expose ourselves easily...”

Many of the Holy Accord Revivors sighed with complicated expressions.

These revived individuals who lived in seclusion in the Holy Accord did not appear in the outside world, and they were still unregistered. Although they had already reached an agreement with Han Xiao to take action when the time came, they had not been summoned yet. They could only continue to hide their existence in the Holy Accord and not participate in the training.

Some of them originally wanted to participate, but Han Xiao did not allow them to be exposed, so they could only give up. Having lost this opportunity, they could not help but feel regretful. If they had known that they would have to participate in the war anyway, they would have chosen to leave their seclusion together with the rest of the revivors at the start.

“Hey, Oathkeeper, when can we join the battle?” someone could not help but ask.

Oathkeeper was expressionless as he said coldly, “Don’t ask me. My words don’t count.”

“Then hurry Black Star more. Otherwise, what’s the use of you?”

Oathkeeper took a deep breath and calmed himself down.

Ever since Black Star became a Transcendent, his leadership position in the Holy Accord organization existed in name only. He had no choice but to ask Black Star for his opinion in almost everything.

What was even more outrageous was that these snobbish Holy Accord Revivors used to be grateful to him when they just revived and respected him. Now that a new generation had replaced the old, these people had all become Black Star’s lackeys and did not give any regards to him, the leader of the organization in name. It was seriously infuriating.

However, Black Star was the only Transcendent in the current Galactic Society, so what else could he do? Oathkeeper had already given up on competing with Black Star. His subordinate position was becoming more stable, and he had to accept reality.

One of the Holy Accord Revivors rubbed his hands and said with a deep voice, “Black Star has given the three Universal Civilizations such a huge advantage. According to the current situation, we might not even have the chance to make a move. Just the association and the direct descendants of the civilizations are enough to deal with the high-level combatants of the enemy... With Black Star’s personality, he might continue to hide our existence as a trump card if he can suppress the enemy.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“That makes sense. Doesn’t that mean we can enjoy the chance to revive in the Sanctum for free?”

Everyone’s eyes lit up.

Secondary dimension world, World Tree territory.

Secondary dimension world, World Tree territory.

Numerous members of the World Tree were gathered there, and every spaceship was glowing with green light.

“The search force has been assembled. Please give instructions.”

In the bridge of the flagship, the Secret Tree King was inspecting the troops. An executive officer walked over quickly and reported in a low voice.

The Tree King nodded and said casually, “Since everyone is here, let’s go.”

In order to find the mother tree’s natural enemy, he had specially come to the secondary dimension world to manage the situation and spent a few days gathering a large number of Blessed Races.

Although the nemesis had not been born for long and Mother Tree’s perception was vague, the World Tree was extremely powerful in the secondary dimension. It had countless troops stationed there, and it was not afraid of spending time to find a needle in a haystack. At this time, the Secret Tree King thought of something and sneered.

“By the way, the enemy seems to have been searching for the main body of the mother tree. We can also solve this matter by capturing the enemy’s team and obtaining their intelligence.”

“Understood.”

The order was quickly passed down, and the search fleet formed by the World Tree’s Blessed Races started moving, turning into streams of light and scattering.

Seeing this, the Secret Tree King narrowed his eyes, raised his palm, and dense magic power flashed between his fingers.

He decided to take action personally this time. If he was lucky enough to meet the enemy’s fleet in the secondary dimension, he would not let any of them escape.

In a desolate universe belt in the explored universe.

A small spaceship slowly landed on a desolate planet. The ground cracked open automatically, revealing a parking orbit. The spaceship smoothly connected with the orbit, moved in, and disappeared into the dark hole. Very soon, the hole closed again, and the disguise was restored. After gliding in the darkness for a while, the spaceship finally stopped and arrived at a secret underground base. The hatch slid open, and a figure walked out. On the other side, another person was already waiting on the platform. When he saw the person, he said in a deep voice, “How’s the situation outside?”

“Another Tree King has been killed. The three Universal Civilizations and the World Tree are in a stalemate. According to this trend, the World Tree will not be able to break through the border defense circle for a very long time.”

“Is that so... it seems like the three Universal Civilizations are still very tenacious. With Black Star around, it’s still unknown who will win.”

“Right now, the World Tree’s biggest weakness is the lack of intelligence. If they get enough intelligence, the situation will change drastically... What did the superiors say?”

“Our superiors have already given orders for us to find a way to provide information about the galactic society to the World Tree while hiding ourselves. The most important thing is to provide the coordinates of the various Star Fields controlled by the three Universal Civilizations so that the World Tree can obtain a detailed strategic map... The Star Alliance has also agreed to this operation. They have always wanted to get rid of the threat of the three Universal Civilizations. After observing for so long, they have finally found a perfect opportunity to destroy them with a borrowed knife.”

“Phew, I can’t remember how many years I’ve been hiding here. I can finally take revenge... It’s time for the three Universal Civilizations to pay the price for what they did back then!”

The two of them had strong hostility toward the three Universal Civilizations.
