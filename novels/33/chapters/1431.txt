Chapter 1432 Reverse Halo

An expedition fleet cruised through the secondary dimensions, passing through space cracks.

The strange scenery outside the window flashed past Harrison’s eyes one after another. He focused on the star map, and the coordinates of the secondary dimensions lit up one after another, drawing the trajectory of the fleet. Behind him, the other crew members did their jobs.

The aide-de-camp stood at the side, pointed at the star map, and said softly, “Following this route, we will cut into the area controlled by the World Tree. Although His Excellency Black Star killed the World Tree’s Blessed Race and caused a gap in their internal defenses, it is still very dangerous for us to go deeper.”

“I know, but only by going deep into the enemy’s territory will we be able to find the World Tree’s main body. Without risking our lives, how can we possibly find anything?” Harrison replied without hesitation.

The aide-de-camp pursed his lips and could not help but say, “Sir, why are you working so hard? With your relationship with His Excellency Black Star...”

“Alright, don’t say such things anymore. You don’t have to persuade me.” Harrison did not even look up.

The aide-de-camp smiled bitterly.

Do you think I care about you? The main thing is that if you shrink back, we can use your relationship to go back and rest...

The aide-de-camp said with resignation, “I think we’ll give free kills.”

“If you have the time to worry, you might as well pray that we’re safe and sound,” Harrison replied casually. “If praying is useful, what’s the point of having an army?” The aide-de-camp muttered softly.

Harrison glanced at him and was about to say something when he suddenly frowned and looked out of the window.

So

“Something’s wrong...” “What’s wrong?” The aide-de-camp was curious.

“I feel uneasy,” Harrison whispered.

“...Quick! Weapon charge, prepare for battle!”

The aide-de-camp and the rest of the crew panicked. They immediately yelled and ordered the fleet to enter combat mode.

They had no choice but to take it seriously. Last time, when Harrison was feeling uneasy, the expeditionary army outpost was gone. In their eyes, Harrison was a jinx. If he had any headache or fever, it meant that they were going to suffer together. Harrison looked at the radar screen vigilantly, but there was no abnormal reaction. The uneasiness in his heart gradually disappeared, and his brows relaxed.

“Could it be an illusion...”

Harrison was a little confused, but he shook his head. Since he did not discover anything, he was not sure if his senses had gone wrong.

“Sir, don’t scare us!”

Hearing this, everyone secretly heaved a sigh of relief, their faces filled with helplessness. They thought it was his bad taste.

The expedition fleet quickly disappeared along the space crack. After they left, a translucent figure appeared in this secondary dimension. It was Hayleen.

“The exploration team of the three Universal Civilizations...”

Hayleen looked in the direction where the fleet disappeared. Her expression changed a few times, but she did not attack in the end.

During this time, she had been searching for suitable secondary dimensions to add the snake-killing agent. Occasionally, she would meet the troops of the three Universal Civilizations.

As the World Tree currently did not need to steal intelligence, she did not make a move. After all, there were other World Tree Blessed Races to deal with these people, and she did not want to alert them and expose herself. Her mission was more important.

However, the expeditionary army was also useful to her. According to the routes of some fleets, together with the mother tree’s reaction to the Pivotal Snake, Hayleen had screened out areas that might be frequented by the Pivotal Snake during this period, as well as some secondary dimensions that might be chosen by the Pivotal Snake as food. All of them were injected with the snake-killing agents. This time was no exception. Hayleen silently activated her space magic, found the traces of Harrison’s fleet, and flew toward their direction. Very soon, she arrived at a strange, rocky secondary dimension. The violent radiation dust storm turned into tornadoes, and there was no sign of life in the entire dimension. “This place isn’t bad.”

Hayleen nodded. As far as she knew, this type of secondary dimension that did not give birth to life but had different substances was the favorite food for the Pivotal Snake. The pure energy type secondary dimension was not liked by it. Maybe it was because of the texture, after all, those with substances were very crispy. She popped out the snake-killing agent and watched it integrate into the secondary dimension. Only then did she use a teleportation spell to leave and find her next target.

Half a month later.

The Realmless King led the Pivotal Snake through the secondary dimension world. The dense mechanical army protected them like a black cloud.

As they passed by the secondary dimensions, everyone would stop for a while to observe the reaction of the Pivotal Snake. If the Pivotal Snake did not start eating, they would continue to go to the next place.

Although all secondary dimensions were food, the Pivotal Snake would not stuff all of them into its mouth. After all, its appetite was limited, and it needed time to digest after eating. As long as it was not extremely hungry, the Pivotal Snake would only start to eat when it met a secondary dimension that suited its taste. As the saying went, it was easy to go from frugal to extravagant, but it was difficult to go from extravagant to frugal. It did not need to find its own food, so its taste was getting more and more picky.

After a while, they arrived at a strange, rocky secondary dimension. The Pivotal Snake immediately started twisting and turning. It took a fancy to this food, and without caring about the others, it started to feast on it. The white fog on its body spread out, and everywhere it passed, the matter was ground and swallowed.

Seeing this, the Realmless King and the mechanical army retreated to the side and did not disturb the Pivotal Snake’s meal.

Seeing that the Pivotal Snake was eating happily, the Realmless King sighed in his heart.

“It’s getting more and more troublesome.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The Realmless King yielded to Han Xiao’s tyrannical power and unwillingly became the stockman of the Pivotal Snake. Even though his lifespan was almost infinite, he felt like his life had given him a heavy blow when he thought about the fact that he would still have to rear the Pivotal Snake for decades. His b*lls hurt so bad... although he did not have this part.

The most terrifying thing was that Black Star still had three embryos. When all of them were hatched, wouldn’t it be four times the happiness for this stockman?

Furthermore, Black Star would definitely force them to give birth to little snakes. One begets two, two begets three, and three begets all things; there would be unlimited offspring...

Damn it! When will these days end?!

The Realmless King felt as if he could see his own bitter future, and he shuddered.

Just as he was feeling sad for his fate, the Pivotal Snake that was eating suddenly stopped and twisted violently, collapsing mountains one after another. It looked in extreme pain as if someone had suddenly stuffed a spoon of mustard into its mouth while eating

“What’s going on?”

The Realmless King was shocked, and he hurriedly came forward to control the Pivotal Snake. The mechanical troops also quickly surrounded it.

However, the Pivotal Snake that was restrained by everyone was still struggling with all its might, like a lively fish being pressed onto a chopping board.

Psionic Prime quickly scanned the vital signs of the Pivotal Snake and said coldly, “Something’s not right. The life force of the Pivotal Snake is rapidly withering, and some unknown compound has already spread in its body. It seems to be a genetic toxin specifically targeted at it, and it has already caused irreversible damage. The damage is still increasing, so it should have been plotted against!”

“There are enemies nearby?” The Realmless King was shocked. He immediately released all his senses, but he did not discover anything.

“Our radar can’t find him either. I’ve already summoned the Lord. He’ll be here soon.”

The moment Psionic Prime finished speaking, a light appeared beside him. It was Han Xiao.

“What’s going on?”

Han Xiao immediately noticed the abnormal situation of the Pivotal Snake. His expression changed slightly, and without hesitation, he poked the Pivotal Snake. The combat information immediately popped up on the interface.

This time, Psionic Prime and the other Mechanical Oracles walked up to him and said with guilt, “We are sorry, we fell into the enemy’s trap unknowingly. This is our negligence. Please punish us...”

“Alright, take your leave.” Han Xiao did not have the time to care about them. He waved his hands and looked at the interface.

At this time, in the status bar of the Pivotal Snake, there was a negative status of (Heavy Poisoning). It was introduced as the genetic toxin specially concocted by the World Tree, and it was only targeted at the Pivotal Snake Race. Once it entered the body, it would cause the gene sequence to shatter. It was completely irreversible, causing the Pivotal Snake’s health to decrease at a rate of 1.5% per second, and its maximum health decreased at a rate of 0.5% per second. He released his senses and scanned the area, but he did not sense the presence of any outsiders. He asked about the situation just now and roughly guessed how the Pivotal Snake was affected.

“‘Damn, they tampered with the meal and happened to pick the correct target. What kind of luck was this...”

Han Xiao’s eyes twitched.

With so many secondary dimensions and the random selection of food by the Pivotal Snake, it just had to hit the jackpot. What kind of probability was this?

Could it be that so many mascots could not slightly dilute my Heavenly Execution Grade luck?

Han Xiao thought to himself. Seeing how much health the Pivotal Snake had lost, he took out a tube of Aurora Potion and injected it into the Pivotal Snake’s body. The effect was immediate, and its health immediately recovered.

However, the effect of being poisoned did not weaken. It still hung on its stats window. Although its health bar was full, the upper limit was still falling. Seeing this, Han Xiao injected a few more shots of Aurora Potion into the Pivotal Snake. The HP regeneration was the same, but it could not get rid of the poisoned status.

“This poison is quite powerful...” Han Xiao’s eyes narrowed. If he was given some time, he would be able to try and crack it. However, with the speed of losing HP in this poison state, it only needed 200 seconds to clear the upper limit of the Pivotal Snake’s health. This amount of time was not enough.

“Alright, let’s experiment with my previous idea.”

Han Xiao activated (Life TransformationVirtual] on the suffering Pivotal Snake.

Now that he had three embryos in his hands, with the cost of trial and error, he originally wanted to experiment on the newborn baby. He did not expect this Pivotal Snake to have an accident, so he might as well try this idea on it.

Streams of data flashed across the body of the Pivotal Snake, and it slowly began to turn incorporeal. Its pain also began to decrease rapidly. The World Tree’s toxin targeted the biological genes. At this moment, the life form of the Pivotal Snake began to change, and it gradually became immune to the toxin effect.

During this process, because the body of the Pivotal Snake was turning incorporeal, the toxins in its body automatically came out and condensed into a drop of black-green liquid that floated in midair.

Seeing that the situation had stabilized, Han Xiao raised his hand to collect this drop of poison. He narrowed his eyes and activated [Bold Explorer) without hesitation.

“Although I’m not afraid of such methods, since you dared to send people here to do something, I can’t let you escape so easily.”
