Chapter 595: Malekith’s Ambush! (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Bang bang bang!

Both of their figures clashed with each other over and over again like a dragon brawling with a snake. They exchange blows as they traversed the brown surface of the planet. Heavy blows landed on both of their bodies as powerful shock waves reverberated through the battlefield.

The shockwaves of the battle had destroyed the original surface of the planet, and craters could be seen all over the surface of the planet.

Malekith’s total level was extremely high and was extremely powerful. While a head-on brawl was not Han Xiao’s strength, thankfully, he had the Berserk Throw skill to throw Malekith around like a ball and break his Pugilist combos.

Han Xiao could choose to transform into the shuttle mode and escape from there at any time. However, he was extremely interested in Malekith’s origins and so decided to have a good fight with him. In any case, the BlackLight Stealth was already hovering up in the sky, and Han Xiao could escape whenever.

Han Xiao then activated the nano transformation ability of the Berserk Ape mechanical suit and transformed into the [Giant Ape Form]. The mechanical suit then expanded rapidly, and various components seemed to have appeared out of nowhere to form thick layers on top of the existing suit. Han Xiao rapidly grew until he was a mini giant that was a head taller than Malekith. His Strength attribute skyrocketed once more, and the strength of [Berserk Throw] was increased.

Both parties were Calamity Grade Supers who had powerful defense and recovery. As such, the battle was stuck in a stalemate.

After battling Han Xiao for a long while, Malekith’s eyes lit up, and he said with great excitement, “You are even stronger than in the rumors. I am going to get serious now. Please don’t die so easily.”

Malekith was a battle maniac, and the pleasure from finding a partner to have a refreshing battle was even greater than mating.

The next moment, Malekith began chanting a demonic incantation, and the flames on his body burned even brighter and greater. His eyes seemed to be burning with flames, and a dark red flame burst forth from the gaps of his armor. His aura was elevated a notch, and the temperature of the surroundings rose rapidly with the atmosphere being contorted by the heat.

“Talent of the Demon Race, high grade True Liberation!” Han Xiao’s eyes narrowed. When they were in such a state, the combat strength of the Demon Race would increase greatly. With Malekith’s Calamity Grade strength, the increase to his strength was frightening. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Bang!

Han Xiao could see the ground beneath him passing by rapidly, and he was sent flying despite being in the Giant Ape Form. The next second, Malekith narrowed the gap between the both of them in an instant, and the dark purple flames surrounding Malekith lashed out like a blade toward Han Xiao’s neck.

If Han Xiao was struck by that blow, his cervical vertebra would probably fracture and his entire body paralyzed. He would need half a second to recover from the blow, and this half a second would be sufficient for a Pugilist like Malekith to perform a simple combo.

Han Xiao deactivated the Giant Ape Form, and his entire body shrank down. The attack brushed past the top of his helmet with only millimeters to spare.

With his attack missing, Malekith locked his fingers together and was about to hammer Han Xiao toward the ground.

At this moment, Han Xiao’s helmet suddenly opened up, and two flaming whirlpools could be seen in his eyes. The next instant, two balls of white flame shot out from his eyes toward Malekith.

Boom!

Malekith’s attack was interrupted again.

There were different kinds of demons within the Demon Race. When they unleashed their True Liberation talent, the difference between the different races would become obvious. For example, the demons that spat fire would be Fire Demons, and the demons that spat ice would be Ice Demons. Malekith was obviously a Fire Demon, and his fire resistance would be extremely high. Thus, Han Xiao’s attack was not able to deal much damage but was able to successfully push him back.

Han Xiao had loaded some Genetic Medicine into his mechanical suit, and he had injected himself with Befuli’s Genetic Medicine previously to use his one-off Character Summon Card.

With the small window that Han Xiao created for himself, he did not hesitate in the slightest and activated the Berserk Overload Form of his mechanical suit!

The nuclear reactor of his mechanical suit revved up at full power, and his speed, strength, and weapons all received an increase in attributes!

Han Xiao placed his arms together, and his nano weapons module was activated. His arm transformed into a large cannon barrel, and a brilliant beam of light shot toward Malekith.

Boom!

Malekith tanked the cannon fire and continued his charge, raising his hands to send out balls of Shockwave Blasts.

Explosions surrounded the two as both of them exchanged fire, with one of them advancing and the other retreating. Malekith’s speed rose rapidly after unleashing his True Liberation talent, and the distance between the two quickly closed up. Very soon, Malekith appeared before Han Xiao again.

His fist that was wrapped up in flames was aimed right at Han Xiao’s chest.

Hum!

Right at this instant, Han Xiao’s body exploded forth with a blinding electrical bolt, and his fists actually landed on Malekith’s face first like a bolt of lightning.

Boom!

His fists exploded in midair like a bolt of violent lightning.

The shockwave of the attack spread out from underneath Han Xiao’s feet in all directions and formed a crater that was a hundred meters in diameter!

As for Malekith, he was already a shooting star in the horizon that quickly disappeared from one’s sight.

[Power Detonation]!

If the attack was a close ranged one, said attack would gain 650 to 700 percent additional damage, power detonation damage, and sputtering damage. On top of that, it gained a sixty-five percent chance of critical damage as well as the ability to inflict status effects like knock up, knock back, suppression, and dizziness.

He did not only use this skill but also activated [Gene Liberation]. This was [Flaming Will] that had been strengthened by the Skill Level-up Card!

The accumulated strength of this attack was truly frightening!

Malekith was sent flying a dozen kilometers at the very least!

He would probably fly for a day in the sky before landing on the ground!

“Huu... huu...”

Han Xiao panted lightly. Hand to hand combat drained him of his stamina the most. His HP and Energy were still at a healthy level, but his stamina had been exhausted greatly.

Thankfully, the higher one’s stamina was, the faster the recovery rate.

“This fellow is truly powerful. He is much stronger than Degulish and Nagakin. I am afraid that my previous blow was only able to give him light injuries.”

Han Xiao wondered if he should continue the battle, and all of a sudden, he remembered Malekith’s origin.

“A core officer of the Bloodshed Land, one of the eight Vanguard Officials under Heber. He is the subordinate of a beyond Grade A Super‽”

Han Xiao immediately became wary. Why would the officer of another beyond Grade A Super fight him?

At that moment, a large trail of dust could be seen from the wilderness, and it was Malekith running back from afar. This time, he did not charge forward but stopped a few meters away from Han Xiao. He had already deactivated his True Liberation state, and there was a red fist mark on his face.

“Well done, Black Star. You are an opponent worthy of my full strength. I truly enjoyed our battle.” Malekith revealed a smile of admiration.

Even when in the True Liberation state, he was not able to suppress the opponent entirely and had even taken a small loss. Black Star was extremely powerful and even more powerful than people thought.

The objective of his visit had been met.

“I know your status already. Malekith, a member of the Bloodshed Land.” Han Xiao did not want to continue fighting and only wanted to know Malekith’s objective. “Why did you ambush me? Why would you appear here?”

“I am here specially for you.”

Black Star was one of the Dragon Emperor’s trusted aides, and the Black Star Army had become extremely famous recently. He had been instructed to observe Black Star and find a chance to test him.

When the Purple Snake Space Pirates abducted the mercenaries of the Black Star Army, the intelligence net of the Bloodshed Land had picked up this piece of news. Since Malekith was nearby, he had decided to snatch the spaceship of the pirates and wait for Black Star to find him. Then, he would be able to test Black Star’s strength without anyone disturbing them.

If he was sufficiently powerful...

“Floating Dragon would only bury a talent like you. You should have greater ambition. With your strength, it is sufficient for you to be equal to me and become the ninth Vanguard Official.” Malekith revealed his intentions and extended an olive branch. “So... are you willing to join the Bloodshed Land?
