Chapter 552: Hang in There, We Will Win!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

On the dock, many Floating Dragon wanderers were hanging around with the galactic pirates, eyeing the BlackLight Stealth with envy and greed in their eyes.

A high-class spaceship from the Federation of Light!

A pity, this valuable spaceship was Black Star’s personal ship. On Floating Dragon Island, there were not many who dared create trouble, and they could only look at it with envy.

“Move aside.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Han Xiao’s voice reverberated from outside the crowd, and the hundreds surrounding the spaceship turned around to take a look. Their faces immediately turned pale, and they all backed off as though they had seen a ghost. All of their eyes were fixed on the lady beside Han Xiao. She was the owner of Floating Dragon Island.

“It’s the Dragon Emperor!”

Cold sweat drenched the onlookers. It was rare for outsiders to be able to see Ames personally. Upon thinking about her strength and status, those pirates felt their legs turn to jelly and an immense amount of pressure.

The two of them ignored the crowd surrounding them and boarded the spaceship.

Hu!

BlackLight Stealth took off and disappeared into the universe like a ray of light.

Everyone had watched as Ames followed Han Xiao onto the spaceship dumbly, and they only reacted after the spaceship took off.

“Dragon Emperor is has left again!”

“She is actually going out with Black Star this time! He is the leader of Floating Dragon’s Field Team. Could it be that Ames is going to take action personally?”

“Not too long after his arrival, Ames followed him away. I have a premonition that something big is about to happen!”

Ames’ status was elevated, and all of her actions and words would cause speculation. All of those pirates who were stopping at Floating Dragon had their own network of information, and this news would rapidly spread.

Very quickly, this piece of news spread all across Floating Dragon Island and made its way into Jenny’s ears very quickly.

Jenny was dumbfounded.

When she found out about this piece of news, her mood crumbled.

It was extremely common for Ames to go out and play, but she usually left alone. Yet, this time, she had actually run away with Black Star!

Just what did Black Star say to Ames‽

Jenny was angered to the point her lips began to tremble. She could predict that in the upcoming days, various problems would come her way, and her workload would increase many times over!

However... Ames was her boss. In the past, she could still complain about Black Star, but if her boss was the one creating trouble, who could she complain to‽

Jenny’s face cramped up, and she almost felt like fainting.

This was what despair felt like!

...

After entering space, Han Xiao activated the autopilot function and stood up from the pilot seat.

“It will take about ten days for us to return to Planet Aquamarine. There are only the two of us on the ship. If you don’t want to sleep, I am willing to accompany you to kill time.”

“This spaceship isn’t too bad.” Ames then looked around the ship before looking at Han Xiao with a smile. “Is there anything to drink?”

The two of them then went into the resting hall, and Ames sat down lazily. Her legs were placed on the sofa as she lay sideways on the sofa with her left hand supporting her head. She did not mind displaying her sexy side before others at all. She enjoyed this comfortable position the most.

Han Xiao opened up his storage shelf and took out a bottle of good wine that Herlous kept inside. Taking out two glasses, he filled them up before sitting opposite Ames.

Ames lifted her finger, and the wine glass on the table levitated toward her. Taking a sip, she complained with a smile, “Tastes terrible.”

“Really? I think that it’s fine...” Han Xiao’s mouth cramped up. Herlous was not a human after all, so his taste was probably unique.

Ames blinked and said, “Talk about yourself. Ever since you joined Floating Dragon, I have not gotten to know you.”

On Noriosse, Han Xiao had helped her to catch Aesop, and Ames was extremely thankful. She was not the kind of person who felt as though it was only right for her subordinates to do everything for her. Compared to the other three beyond Grade A Supers in the Shattered Star Ring, her personality was more easygoing.

A couple of years ago, she did not think highly of Han Xiao and only allowed him to join Floating Dragon because of Aesop. In just a few years’ time, not only was Black Star able to firmly secure his place, his strength had increased rapidly as well. While it was still far from her current strength, the speed of his growth had still surprised her.

Ames could not help but be interested in this subordinate of hers. Only then did she realize that she did not understand much about him.

Hearing that, Han Xiao began narrating his past. Naturally, he left out about the news regarding the players. Starting from the Germinal Organization, he then continued to talk about the Inhumans on Planet Aquamarine and his own subordinates.

Han Xiao only stopped after half a day and drank a mouthful of wine to moisten his throat. He was not against the idea of sharing his stories. This was the best time for him to spend some time together with Ames alone, and it was a good opportunity to bring their relationship closer. Furthermore, Ames was a beauty, and while Han Xiao naturally would not be controlled by his desires with his strength, he still enjoyed admiring a beauty.

At the very least, it was better than looking at the hairy and stocky Harmon.

Hearing Han Xiao’s narration, Ames tapped her thigh with her finger and said, “A pair of sisters controlling the strength of life and death... I seem to have heard of it before.”

She was not interested in politics, nations, or wars. Instead, Aurora and Hila caught her attention.

He did not hide the story of Aurora and Hila. In his previous life, the Hila who descended into darkness had been even more terrifying than Ames. Hila was still extremely weak, but there seemed to be something strange. Ames usually would not be bothered about the happenings on a backward planet. If she had heard about something similar before, it had to have come from an extremely high level.

“You said that Aroshia is an AI lifeform. Are the millions of Space Wonders from your hometown the same?”

Han Xiao shook his head and pretended to ponder. “They should be different.”

After finishing his sentence, a change suddenly occurred in the resting hall.

Hum!

A ray of light transformed into a human form, and Risda made his appearance, sitting beside Han Xiao.

“Why are you out here?” Han Xiao asked with doubt.

Ames also looked toward Risda with curiosity.

Risda stood up slowly and bowed deeply toward Ames with sincerity.

“Lord Dragon Emperor, I wish to plead with you about something. Please help my civilization and save my brethren! I am willing to offer myself as the price and listen to your commands forever!”

When Han Xiao mentioned AI civilizations, Risda found out that Ames was a powerful individual on the same level as the Mechanic who occupied his homeland.

This was a chance for him to seek help. Even if the chance of the Dragon Emperor agreeing was only one percent, Risda was not willing to give up. If Ames was willing to give her aid, everything would become simple. What seemed to be previously impossible would now become possible.

“Fighting?” Ames raised her brows. “Who is the opponent?”

“He is a Mechanic who snatched my homeland and enslaved my tribe, turning them all into his weapons. I will never forget his name. He is called Manison. The Ancient One. Papachi!”

“Oh, so he is someone from the [Mechanic Empire] of the Primeval Star River. He is also a member of The Ancient Ones.” Ames shook her head. “I reject your request.”

The Primeval Star River was another large star field just like the Shattered Star Ring. The status of Manison’s [Mechanic Empire] was just like Ames’ [Dragon Emperor] in the Shattered Star Ring.

‘The Ancient Ones’ was a special organization, and Ames’ foster father, Aesop, had once belonged to ‘The Ancient Ones’. However, he had left afterward.

While Risda had already been prepared for rejection, he was still very disappointed and could not help but ask, “May I know the reason for your rejection?”

“I can’t win against him,” Ames replied casually.

Risda’s light figure became unstable, and he gasped in shock. “Even... even you aren’t his match...”

Han Xiao was not too surprised. Beyond Grade A was a general category, and there were naturally those who were stronger and weaker. While Ames was powerful, she was not invincible. Ames had also never thought that she was invincible.

...

Ten days passed by in a flash. Without much to do on the spaceship, Han Xiao chatted with Ames almost every day, and the relationship between them became much better than before.

Planet Aquamarine appeared outside the window, and a large number of Godoran spaceships could be seen outside the atmosphere of Planet Aquamarine. Upon noticing the BlackLight Stealth approaching, they immediately sent out a warning.

“State your identity!”

“It’s me,” Han Xiao replied.

“Black Star, you may land.” The other party’s tone eased up. While danger was all around at the moment and they had to be extremely careful, Han Xiao was someone who had fought with them before, and it was already proven that he was not an enemy.

After gaining clearance, BlackLight Stealth landed in the Sanctuary. Looking down at the Sanctuary, it seemed as though there were even more refugees at the moment with the majority of them being tied up. While Han Xiao had not been around, a couple of incidents had taken place on Planet Aquamarine, but they had all been taken care of. The players had plenty of things to do, and they spent their time extremely well.

DarkStar did not ambush the calamity planets again, but they went to harass the other colonies instead, causing the situation to become even more precarious and the Godorans to become more and more frustrated. However, none of that affected Han Xiao.

Opening up the hatch, Ames drifted out and looked around. “This is your hometown? How nice. It is a pity that my hometown is already an abandoned planet.”

“The Inhumans are all gathered in the plaza. I shall not accompany you. I have some things to deal with,” Han Xiao said.

Ames nodded and floated to the plaza alone as she looked at the players with curiosity.

A player turned around and was immediately dumbfounded, gawking in shock.

“A,A,A,A... Ames‽”

“You recognize me?” Ames was surprised. She had thought that these Inhumans were a backward bunch and had never expected them to recognize her.

The number of people who noticed Ames increased, and the players were all shocked.

It was as if magic had been cast over the originally noisy plaza. With Ames as the center, the ‘magic’ spread out in all directions, and the entire plaza became silent. All their emotions were brewing.

Boom!

The next moment, the players erupted into cheers!

...

On the other side, Han Xiao did not follow Ames and hurried his way over to the Godoran camp, requesting to meet Nagakin.

The Godoran guard shook his head, and his answer was no different from half a month ago. “Black Star, Sir Nagakin is currently in an emergency meeting and does not have time to meet you. Please leave.”

Han Xiao’s objective was set this time, and he said in a deep voice, “Go and tell him that I have a new mutation source in my hands! I don’t care what he is doing. I want him to see me immediately!”

The faces of the guards changed, and they did not dare make the decision. One of them hurriedly informed Nagakin.

After waiting for less than two minutes, a golden light flashed out from the depths of the Godoran camp and stopped in front of him. All the fixtures in the way of the golden light was smashed apart, and a long running trail could be seen behind. The golden light was Nagakin.

Knowing the purpose of Han Xiao’s visit, Nagakin had been shocked to the point he had almost fallen off his chair. How could he be bothered about continuing the meeting? He had rushed out without the slightest bit of delay and did not even wish to waste time walking as he hurried to welcome Han Xiao.

“Is what you said true‽” Nagakin asked anxiously.

Han Xiao took out the transparent ball with the mutation source sealed within it, and it attracted Nagakin’s gaze like a powerful magnet.

“Let’s go in and talk.”

Han Xiao waved his sleeves to block Nagakin’s vision and chuckled.

It is time to turn the tables around!
