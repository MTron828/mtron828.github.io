Chapter 1176 This Is the Technology You Have Missed

As Han Xiao and Ames entered the Modo expeditionary army’s territory, like adding water to a boiling pot, the stationed Modo troops instantly started moving, searching for the whereabouts of the two of them. Part of the fleets at the frontline were also called back to provide support.

If this was really a Super Star Cluster civilization’s headquarters, any Beyond Grade A would find it difficult trying to break through it. However, this was the Flickering World, so the Modo expeditionary army’s control over their territory was clearly not as strong as their home. The construction of many planets was not even complete yet.

Not just Modo, all the members of the Super Star Cluster Alliance only had limited control over their territory in the free competition zone. The military forces of expeditionary armies were not the strongest to begin with. Only a few years had passed since the start of the fourth exploration phase, and most of the time was spent on exploring, so there was not much time left for operations. Therefore, due to many factors, Han Xiao and Ames could go practically anywhere they wanted in the Modo expeditionary army’s territory. The Modo fleets could only chase after them.

An asteroid belt slowly floated in space. On one of the asteroids, two people were sitting with their legs crossed. It was Han Xiao and Ames.

“... Their location still hasn’t changed. The leaders of the Modo expeditionary army are still in the command center. Tsk, if this was a less developed civilization, they might be fleeing right now, thinking they might get lucky and escape.” Streams of data flashed past Han Xiao’s eyes. As he retracted the data needle he planted into the Modo expeditionary army’s network, his eyes returned to their original black color.

Ames casually played with two pieces of highly condensed metal she scraped from the asteroid, raised her brows slightly, and said, “We’ve been here for more than half a month. Everyone in Modo knows we’re here. Yet, they’re not running but have been staying in the command center. Are they waiting for us to go there?”

“Maybe they know that there’s no use in running and have accepted their fate. Only advanced civilizations can see things this clearly.” Han Xiao shrugged and was not concerned at all.

While speaking, he opened the secondary dimensional army box, released batches of mechanical soldiers, and nodded slightly. These soldiers turned into streams of light and left in different directions.

Ames watched this from the side. She then sighed and said, “Black Star, we could directly head toward the Modo expeditionary army’s command center, which will save a lot of time, but you had to take a detour. Otherwise, we would’ve completed our goal long ago.”

Han Xiao sighed, looked like he was about to stand up, and said, “So, you don’t like me spending more time with you. Alright then, we’ll go there and get this done with...”

“Who said so? Sit down!” Ames changed the topic instantly. “You said you were going to plant plenty of secret sentries in the Modo expeditionary army’s territory. The plan is already more than half done. How can we give it up now?” Black Star was a busy man. The next time they went to the secondary dimensions would be at least a decade a later. But since he had squeezed out some time now to accompany her, of course she was not willing to let it end this early.

Han Xiao chuckled in his mind and sat down again.

Other than killing the leaders of the expeditionary army, he also had another goal

– plant tons of wards in Modo’s territory. Otherwise, he would not have taken a detour that delayed them by over two weeks after rushing into the enemy’s territory.

He had already sent out god knew how many batches of mechanical troops during this time and hidden them inside the Modo expeditionary army’s territory.

These mechanical troops could all be remotely controlled, of course. One reason for this was to deal more damage to Modo, another was to confuse Modo’s fleets, and a third was to obtain intelligence and monitor Modo’s movements, hoping to find out the final destination of the various transportation routes of the Modo Civilization. At the same time, he also planted some Thrones so that he could infiltrate anytime without anyone knowing in the future.

The Modo Civilization certainly knew he had left these mechanical soldiers. They would have no choice but to deploy large amounts of manpower to search for them. Also, Han Xiao had another reason to take a detour.

“I purposely gave Modo so much time to prepare. I wonder if any Beyond Grade As rushed here to protect the command center...” Han Xiao scratched his chin.

Without the protection of any Beyond Grade As, killing the commander in a split second was easy, so Han Xiao wanted to lure the snake out of its nest. He deliberately took his time to give the Modo upper echelons more time to consider their options, as well as to pressure them. After all, the longer he spent so casually loitering around in their territory, the more face Modo would lose.

If the Modo upper echelons could not take it anymore and sent Beyond Grade As over as guards, he would have an opportunity to deal even more damage to Modo and really make them hurt. This was his biggest goal of this trip.

It looked like he was only targeting the commanders of the Modo expeditionary army, but he was actually fighting the Modo Civilization’s upper echelons strategically.

While thinking, he opened the forums and took a look at it. Herlous was still attacking the exterior line of defenses of the Modo expeditionary army, but only attacking and not advancing. Even when they penetrated their defenses, they were not stepping over but instead returned to rest. They then continued to attack the next location.

If those armed forces following behind were still in the Ferdinand Battle Zone, they would definitely not have given up on this opportunity and would have advanced all the way in. This was the reason the Modo expeditionary army’s exterior line of defense kept shrinking Now, however, Han Xiao had chased away all those armed forces, so Modo had time to fill up the gaps. However, they felt even worse.

The Black Star Army’s actions were driving the commanders of the Modo expeditionary army at the various fronts crazy. They kept rubbing on the outside but refused to thrust in. It was torture. However, this was where their duty lay. They were not allowed to give up; they had to keep resisting despite it being meaningless.

Without Han Xiao at the frontlines, the guild alliances on the Super Star Cluster Alliance side felt confident again and continued to fight the national war against the army players. It was a battle, but both sides were enjoying it. One side was glad the enemy’s boss had left, and the other side was glad they did not have to watch cutscenes from the side.

On a planet occupied by a certain Beyond Grade A elsewhere in the Flickering World, a tall being walked back and forth in the palace, holding a communicator. He looked rather anxious. It seemed like he was waiting for someone to call.

Beep beep!

The communicator rang. This tall being instantly picked up and hastily said, “How’d my request go? Did the people above approve

it?”

On the secret channel, an emissary with a blurry face said with a serious tone, “No, the upper echelons won’t allow you to help the Modo expeditionary army. Don’t act on your own!”

“Black Star has been loitering around Modo’s territory for almost a month. We’ve had so much time to prepare, yet we still haven’t sent any Beyond Grade As over to help. It doesn’t make sense! How will other organizations view us? How will our allies in the expeditionary army feel?” The tall being was furious.

If Han Xiao was there, he would have recognized that this was the kid who started the fire during the Beyond Grade A Association plenary. He was indeed a secret direct member of the Modo Civilization. However, although he was a direct member, he had his temper too and was quite daring. Otherwise, he would not have dared speak in front of two peak Beyond Grade As, Black Star and the Mechanic Emperor back then.

Almost all the organizations in the Flickering World were watching Black Star’s movements. They all knew it had been almost a month since he entered the Modo expeditionary army’s territory. If Modo did not take any actions in this kind of situation and let Black Star do whatever he wanted, the entire civilization would lose face. It was understandable for this Beyond Grade A to get angry.

“What’s the point of going? Can you beat Black Star? You’ll be going there to die! Even if all of our hidden Beyond Grade As go there, you guys still won’t be a match for Black Star!” the emissary said angrily. “Stay rational. You can’t expose yourself here! This is all for the future!”

The tall being was filled with frustration, but he had to admit that Black Star was terrifyingly strong. He would only be giving up his life by going.

If they sent Beyond Grade As over, Black Star would eat them up. If they did not send Beyond Grade As over, the reputation and image of the Modo Civilization would be damaged. Not only would they bring shame to themselves, they would also make people feel they were cold-blooded. The morale of the expeditionary army would undoubtedly plummet.

Black Star was able to achieve this just by deliberately walking slower.

This was an honest conspiracy! Thinking of how Black Star spoke so confidently during the plenary, this Beyond Grade A felt both furious and horrified.

What did Modo ever do to deserve such a terrifying enemy!

Another half a month passed in the blink of an eye. Although Han Xiao and Ames took their time, they eventually arrived at the destination.

Countless Modo fleets surrounded the command center of the Modo expeditionary army. All the crews were on edge with grave expressions. Although they were the side with the numerical advantage, they were the side that was extremely nervous.

“These two *ssholes are finally here!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Inside the command center, Roddick clenched his teeth. His eyes were extremely red ,and his hair was excessively messy. He looked severely exhausted, but his face was still filled with rage.

“They’re finally here...” Lagos, who was on the side, was not in a better state too, but he looked relieved.

The two of them knew clearly that Black Star and the Dragon Emperor were coming for them. However, the two of them had taken way too long. At the start, the two of them were immensely nervous, and then they entered desperation, before gradually becoming restless. In the end, they were almost going mad from waiting. Black Star and the Dragon Emperor were like two blades slowly moving toward their neck. Days felt like years.

This feeling of waiting for a certain death was complete mental torture for the two of them.

Originally, Roddick and Lagos did not wish for them to come quickly. However, as time passed, their mindset went from ‘please come slower’ to ‘why the f*ck are they still not here’. They almost wanted to rush Black Star and the Dragon Emperor to come quicker.

Plus, the Modo Civilization had never sent any Beyond Grade As in the past one and a half months, so Roddick and Lagos were more certain they had been abandoned. Filled with sorrow and hopelessness, they had accepted their fate. They would die one way or another, so they rather die sooner.

Roddick turned on the public channel and said with a ferocious tone, “Black Star! Aren’t you here to kill us? Do it!”

Hearing the roar in the channel, the many Modo soldiers there felt somewhat betrayed.

They all knew that Modo did not send any help and had abandoned them. To say they did not feel betrayed would be a lie. However, as soldiers, they would still obey their orders even if they knew they were headed for death.

Han Xiao looked around, turned up his senses to the maximum, and laughed with a shake of his head.

“Yoho, Modo is quite patient. I’ve given them more than enough time, but they still haven’t sent a single Beyond Grade A. Are they that afraid of me?”

Ames smiled and said, “Who isn’t afraid of you in the entire universe?’”

“Never mind, this proves that Modo has learned their lesson.”

Han Xiao shook his head. Although he was unable to lure the snake out of its nest, he did not mind. After all, he would still be able to damage Modo’s image.

He looked around. His eyes stopped at one location in the Modo expeditionary army’s base. That was where the command center was located, and the targets he was going to kill were inside.

Han Xiao turned and asked, “So, are you going to personally slice the targets up, or should I do it?”

At the start, Ames wanted to kill Lagos and Roddick with her own hands. However, thinking of the experience she shared with Han Xiao in the past few days, she shook her head carelessly.

“Whether you or I do it doesn’t make a difference.”

“I’ll do it then. It’ll be more efficient. You’re too slow.”

As Ames rolled her eyes, Han Xiao coughed and ordered the mechanical soldiers behind him to advance.

He knew that the Modo Civilization would certainly set up tons of spacetime stabilization devices near its base, so he had summoned a mechanical army long before he arrived.

Seeing this, the Modo fleet instantly responded. The crews suppressed their complicated emotions and became firm, staring at the renowned Black Star far away, ready for the battle to begin.

Han Xiao glanced at them and snapped his fingers. These mechanical soldiers suddenly stood still. Dense white noise appeared, and space bent slightly around them.

The next moment, this batch of mechanical soldiers disappeared. When they reappeared, they had already moved a long distance forward but were still in a stationary state, like a painting

Boom!

In the face of this strange scene, the Modo fleet did not hesitate and fired instantly, shattering these mechanical soldiers. However, something shocking happened next. This batch of mechanical soldiers reappeared again. Not only were they completely undamaged, but their location had moved forward a long distance once again, closer to the command center.

This strange scene made the Modo fleet perplexed.

Han Xiao narrowed his eyes. “Using the Kunde Race’s technology against you people is considered using it in the right place.”

This scene that looked like a screen lagging was indeed the technology Han Xiao had obtained from the Kunde Race—the Spacetime Splicing Technology!

With his research and improvement over so many years, the Spacetime Splicing Technology he had now was far from its original version. It was way more enhanced and upgraded. This technology was now rather matured. It would no longer be easily countered by all kinds of spacetime devices like the original version. The difficulty and time required to break this technology using the same methods as before would be at least seven to eight times higher. This meant that it could stay operational for a longer period of time.

Although the Crimson Dynasty did not allow him to casually use this in front of others, Han Xiao had a flash of insight just now and intuitively felt that if he used the Kunde Race’s trump card to fight Modo, it might be beneficial for the mission. He trusted his intuition quite a lot, so he did it.

In the face of this unknown technology, the Modo army panicked and used all kinds of attacks. However, no matter what attacks they used, they could not stop this army of mechanical soldiers blinking forward. Part of their fleet had no choice but to attack Han Xiao himself, but the attacks were all easily guarded by Han Xiao and Ames. Furthermore, their battleships were getting hacked frequently.

“Impossible!”

Roddick’s eyes opened wide with shock. As he stared at the approaching mechanical troops, his eyes filled with deep desperation.

In order to fight Black Star, he had brought tons of fleets, thinking he would at least be able to put up a fight. However, to his absolute dismay, Black Star simply used one ability he had never seen before and easily penetrated the line of defenses of the fleet, threatening his life.

“What the hell is this technology?” Lagos was stunned too.

Hearing the shocking tone of the two of them in the public channel, Han Xiao suddenly smiled and said with a mocking tone, “Fate really has a bad taste... To tell you the truth, this is the technology the Modo Civilization missed. You guys were so close to obtaining it in the past. It’s a shame.”

The Modo Civilization’s stowaways were the first ones to discover the Kunde Race. If not because they wanted to trick them in order to plot against the Crimson Dynasty, they would not have missed the Spacetime Splicing Technology

“The technology we missed?” Lagos murmured. His intuition told him that what Black Star said might be true.

He was filled with complicated emotions. Finally, under the raging focus fire of the Modo fleets, the mechanical army appeared outside the porthole of the command center, completely unharmed.

Roddick and Lagos opened their eyes wide and stared at this mechanical army as the energy furnace on the mechanical soldiers’ chests lit up, flickering with a burning bright white light. The next moment, their consciousness went blank.

Boom!

An intense explosion occurred, and a pale blue psionic shockwave expanded.

The command center was annihilated; not even debris was left behind. A huge part of the entire base went missing.

Roddick and Lagos, as well as most of the leaders of the Modo expeditionary army, died in this explosion, leaving not a single trace behind.

“This is just taking a little bit of interest. Let’s hope Modo doesn’t get discouraged. We have more than enough time to have some fun.” Looking at the raging Modo fleets, Han Xiao chuckled and placed his hands around Ames’ waist. The King extended and shrouded them.

Whoosh!

In a flash of light, before the Modo fleets surrounded them, the two of them disappeared without a trace. The spacetime stabilizers placed in this area could not stop them even a little bit.
