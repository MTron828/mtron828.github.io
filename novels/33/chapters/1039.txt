“So, this is what the [Spirit Instrument]’s benefits are.”

Han Xiao’s eyes sparkled.

[Spirit Instrument] was a class talent he obtained by default after becoming a Divine Throne Mechanic, which was only effective when building Universal Treasures. When successful, it would give bonuses. This was his first time seeing the exact bonuses it gave, and he was pleasantly surprised.

Previously, Han Xiao did not if there were any other ways to obtain God’s Trait Transformation Points, but now he had found one—building Universal Treasures.

The same blueprint would not provide multiple points, meaning even if he built another gold-grade King mechanical suit, he would not receive more God’s Trait Transformation Points. Hence, he needed to get more gold blueprints.

Han Xiao was curious. There were other Beyond Grade A Mechanics who had built Universal Treasures throughout history, but from the intelligence provided by the dynasty, this method of obtaining God’s Trait Transformation Points was not mentioned.

He had some speculations.

Some Beyond Grade As who successfully built Universal Treasures probably did not fulfill the prerequisites to obtain God’s Trait Transformation Points, so they could not notice this effect. For example, Austin.

As for those who knew, maybe they hid this information for their own purposes and did not report it... or the advanced civilizations kept this a secret deliberately.

It could even be that he was the only one who could obtain God’s Trait Transformation Points through this method because the other Beyond Grade As did not have the interface!

Of course, it could also be that the dynasty did not know about this but the other two Universal Civilizations did. After all, the three Universal Civilizations were not a family; they would not share their secrets.

“The problems I’m facing now at this level are finally touching the blind spots of the Universal Civilizations... Makes sense. The dynasty doesn’t know about the First Sanctum too.”

Han Xiao shook his head.

“I still have the Emperor’s Cape blueprint in my hands. If I’m able to build it, I’ll obtain another God’s Trait Transformation Point. Indeed, becoming stronger through building things is the best way for Mechanics.”

As for the randomly decreased Attribute Points that were changed into Free Attribute Points, it was similar to resetting attributes. After every level up, Race Evolution, or Promotion, all attributes would automatically be increased. This would shift some of the Attribute Points in less important attributes to the main attribute, slowly making him stronger, which was quite useful.

Han Xiao felt that this could be triggered repeatedly but probably had a limit. Maybe the number of points reduced and given was related to the difficulty of building the Universal Treasure. The more difficult it was, the more points would be affected.

Furthermore, following the logic of the increased cost of blueprint gambling... if he built the same Universal Treasure multiple times, the points should decrease slowly too. For example, King reset two hundred of his Attribute Points the first time, but the second time might be less than two hundred.

“By the way, this time, it actually decreased my Luck...”

Han Xiao opened the attribute interface and looked at his Luck, which turned from a stick to an egg. His mouth twitched uncontrollably.

In his previous life, players with the subclass [Gambler] had tested that the lowest the Luck attribute could go was zero. It was the bottom line. To Gamblers, it meant this put them at an ‘unbeatable’ spot.

He previously only had one Luck, which had decreased to zero, and then he obtained two hundred Free Attribute Points...

“So, I basically netted 199 Attribute Points‽

“I don’t know if this is lucky or unlucky...”

Han Xiao was speechless.

Although it was an amazing deal, he could not smile. Tears were running in his belly.

“Sometimes, you only realize how precious something is when you have already lost it.

“Brother, I can’t do without you. It cannot be zero!”

The Great Mechanic Han clenched his teeth and solemnly pressed on the “+” button beside his Luck attribute...

+1.

The next moment, the value of his LUK attribute returned to that noble, pure, magnificent, and holy ‘1’.

Han Xiao almost felt like his soul had ascended.

Actually, Han Xiao was mainly worried that if his Luck was zero, the next time an attribute reset came, Luck would not be considered in the range of attributes.

He looked depressed, but he was actually overjoyed and wanted it to happen to him more.

“In addition to what I have in my interface, I now have 2,248 Free Attribute Points. My Endurance is now more than 11,700, and as long as it exceeds 15,000, I will be able to obtain one more God’s Trait Transformation Point through the next Promotion... Hmm, let’s save it for now.”

Suppressing his excitement, Han Xiao looked at his attributes interface, pondered a while, and used the one God’s Trait Transformation Point on [God’s Trait Transformation—Machinery].

Machinery and Void represented his main class and species; the transformation paths of these two should be mostly the same for everyone. Through testing, the former enhanced his Mechanic abilities, and the latter strengthened his Racial Talents and gave him bonus attributes.

Since he now had [Spirit Instrument] as a method to obtain God’s Trait Transformation Points, he would have to invent more gold blueprints, which would require strong Mechanic abilities. Not only did the main class path increase his basic Machinery Affinity and ability strength, it also slightly enhanced the effects of his various Mechanic abilities.

The next moment, his cells operated at full capacity. His energy waves increased drastically, and electric sparks appeared from all over his body. His flesh and bones were both itching and hurting, which made him narrow his eyes a little.

God’s Trait Transformation—Machinery (2/?)

Stage One: +1,000 Machinery Affinity, +20% Ability power. The basic effects of all Mechanic class abilities are slightly enhanced.

Stage Two (New): +15% building, enhancing, repairing abilities, +1% Machinery Affinity for every 30 INT. Main branch ability effects enhanced (Virtual Branch).

_____________________

“Not bad.”

Han Xiao scratched his chin. He felt like this was not as good as the first enhancement. It might be that the first stage was like a welcoming gift and was an exception, while the later stages would keep getting better.

Then, he looked at the new talent, [Universal Treasure Creator]. Its introduction was that building a Universal Treasure meant that he had touched a certain new level. Its effect was +10% Machinery Creation Performance, +1 level to all machinery abilities, +4% basic success rate of building gold equipment, and +2% basic success rate of inventing gold blueprints.

Its effects were quite good, but Han Xiao’s attention was attracted by the notification that came with this talent.

_____________________

You have obtained the talent [Universal Treasure Creator]. You have fulfilled the requirement.

You have received 1 [The First Sanctum] Ability Fragment.

“This so-called The First Sanctum again...”

An electric spark flashed past Han Xiao’s eyes.

He now had two Ability Fragments, and he still did not know what use they had, but since they were so difficult to obtain, it was definitely something important.

Without any clues, there was no point in overthinking. Han Xiao put the thought away and looked at the Legendary Point given.

_____________________

Achievement Legendary Point: Universal Treasure Artisan—You have built a Universal Treasure. From this moment forth, you’re one of the top artisans in the entire universe. You’ve become a master. The things you have built will be passed on as treasures in the future.

“Speaking of which, since I have the core technology, if I build more Kings and sell them, I can make quite a lot of money.”

Han Xiao smiled at this thought.

He was just thinking about it. There was no way he would exchange his trump card for money; he now had no interest in money.

After making sure he had gone through all the new things he had obtained on the attributes interface, Han Xiao finally looked at the gold Grade King mechanical suit closely.

At this point, it was not yet colored. The appearance of King was a magnificent full cover style mechanical armor. The details on every piece of its plates were exceptionally exquisite, giving off the beauty of a top-class mechanical product. It was like a piece of art.

A palm-sized triangular device was embedded on its chest and was glowing slightly. This was the King mechanical suit’s only set attachment, Throne. As long as it was taken off, no matter where it was placed, the King would be able to instantly arrive at its place. Its effect was comparable to the Multi-Dimensional Sky Opening Transportation Device.

Performance-wise, naturally, it was far superior to orange equipment in every way. As equipment specially made for Beyond Grade A Mechanics, it provided a 1.075 multiplier to the wearer’s total Machinery Affinity, as well as a thirty-five percent bonus to the effective area of Mechanical Force enhancement. It was a mechanical suit that was top-notch even among Beyond Grade A equipment.

Han Xiao immediately put it on like an old driver who had just bought a new car, tested it with excitement, and recorded the various parameters. Only then did he reluctantly stow it away.

“If the mechanical suit I was using last time was a home-use Volkswagen, King would be a Pagani, Koenigsegg, or a Bugatti sports car.”

Han Xiao was very satisfied.

After organizing all his gains, he ordered the mechanical assistants to clean up the workshop while he set the Divine Mechanical Throne to lazy sofa mode.

He leaned back and opened the forums comfortably, planning to reward himself by looking at those idiotic players.

In Version 4.0, the player forums had made some changes and updates. It added the new Flickering World panel, which was like a world channel to the players.

As more and more people arrived, the popularity of the Flickering World panel exceeded all the other panels in no time, quickly becoming the most active channel on the forums.

Han Xiao flipped through the posts for a while and saw Bun-Hit-Dog’s newly released video.

The Black Star Army series got a new episode again. Its content was what the army had done during the version update, and its views seemed to have broken records again.

He clicked in and watched it. This was not really the best episode ever, but since tons of players had joined the Black Star Army, more people came to learn about the Black Star Army’s history, hence the explosive increase in the view count of even the videos posted in the past.

Ever since Version 1.0, Bun-Hit-Dog had been making series videos, which already had many episodes by now. The new players could binge-watch from the start and learn about the complete rise of the Black Star Army. As a super faction that grew before the eyes of the players, it could give them a strong sense of immersion.

Most of the foreign players who had joined the army came for the benefits and did not have any sense of belonging at all. However, learning the history of a faction could slowly build up their unity, and Bun-Hit-Dog’s series videos played a huge part in that, like fertilizer.

“Ideology construction has to be heeded. They need to be given more knowledge about the Black Star Army so that the players will feel the warmth of a home.”

While mumbling, Han Xiao continued to flip through the posts. Suddenly, he saw that someone had made a post to expose the Limitless Financial Group.

The content was shockingly the spying mission given by Sorokin, which required players to purchase intelligence from Black Star Army players.

The Limitless Financial Group actually kept this secret very well. At least Han Xiao did not know about it through other sources. Sadly, the players sold Sorokin out on the forums.

It’s probably more difficult for me not to know...

Han Xiao’s mouth contorted slightly.

The player forums were a special information exchange platform; no outsider could interfere with it. However, he could browse it, which gave him an incomparable intelligence advantage that currently only he had.

To him, players were a natural free intelligence network. Even if he did nothing and sat at home, the player forums would continuously provide intelligence about the other organizations.

Currently, the Limitless Financial Group was the organization that was most passionate about recruiting the players other than himself. That unlucky b*stard wanted to use the players as his spies but had no idea that he was exposed by the players instead, and Han Xiao did not have to pay the price for it.

The joy of having privileges has always been this simple and dull.

Thinking of Sorokin’s face that was clearly covered in plots and conspiracies, Han Xiao almost wanted to laugh.

Might as well let the army players accept his mission, then sell some intelligence to take Sorokin’s money for free. He’s that rich anyway.

While Han Xiao was having these wicked ideas, he suddenly saw a very popular post title, and his attention was pulled over immediately.

‘The Army Players’ Corpses Have Been Camped Time After Time. Who Is Targeting the Black Star Army‽’
