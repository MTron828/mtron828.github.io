Chapter 432: Revenge from the Past (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The captains’ eyes opened widely. “Why is it my account‽ I didn’t do it! Twenty-two hours ago... I was sleeping at that time! It’s the culprit, the culprit stole my account! But... the login password is my biometric data, how can they be stolen...”

The people looked at him doubtfully. Maybe it was you. Now that the surveillance footage is gone, you can say whatever you want.

“There are a few possibilities. Maybe the superiors of your travel agency worked with another organization that is against us, or maybe the opposite party used some method to get the captain’s body password data, or maybe... there’s a shapeshifter Esper hidden in the ship,” Herlous contemplated.

Everyone’s face changed. They looked at each other with suspicion—everyone looked like an enemy.

Han Xiao raised his eyebrows and looked around the crowd. Everyone on the ship was gathered here, even Sylvia. She hid at the edge of the crowd and showed half of her face, sizing him up...

His eyes suddenly narrowed.

Wait a minute, Sylvia?

With a flash of insight, Han Xiao finally realized where the strange feeling came from. He looked at Dekker and said, “Sylvia is your friend’s daughter, is she?”

Dekker nodded and said with a confused face, “Yes, what’s wrong with that?”

Han Xiao squinted his eyes. “Her family... only has her father, and if I remember correctly, that person is not a nobody. I almost fell for your lies; you acted quite well. Leniency for those who confess, severity for those who resist. Are you going to confess on your own, or do you need me to help you confess?”

Dekker’s expression froze. His eyes clearly expressed his shock and disbelief.Why do you know who Sylvia is‽

Although Han Xiao did not know exactly who Sylvia’s father was, he remembered that her father was a villain in the background introduction, and that was enough. Dekker was just a regular employee of a business organization, yet he had a villainous friend. It was certainly possible but still very questionable...

Han Xiao shook his head in his mind. He should have noticed this long ago, but everything was normal, so he did not think too much about it. It seemed like he had let his guard down a little recently.

After resting for a month due to the Pro League, along with not facing any huge threats in the nine months before that, his alertness had decreased subconsciously. Luckily, he noticed that in time and became more alert.

This time, Sylvia walked out. She was frowning. The feeling that she gave was completely different; the young and energetic feeling that she gave earlier was all a disguise. Although her body was still in puberty, the feeling that she gave was not like a teenage girl anymore—she felt more mature.

Sylvia stared at Han Xiao; her tone was complex and mixed with astonishment.

“You know me?”

She could not figure out how it was possible for Han Xiao to recognize who she was despite him meeting her for the first time. Logically, Black Star should not even know that she existed; she should have always been hidden in the dark.

Sylvia had thought of many possible ways in which she would be found out but never thought of her identity being exposed. Because of this, she would not be able to carry out her plan anymore.

In reality, if Han Xiao did not remember Sylvia’s character background, he would not have known the identity of the culprit. It was indeed not a coincidence to suddenly meet a future renowned character!

Sylvia clenched his teeth and spat furiously, “Black Star, my father was sent to jail by you. You dishonorable mercenaries only fight for money, and for that, you help those tyrants suppress the people who are suffering. My father could’ve saved everyone, but he couldn’t because of your mercenaries!”

Since she was already exposed, she did not act like a teenage girl anymore.

The players exchanged looks confusingly. When did we do something like that?

Maple Moon could not help but ask, “Little girl, what’s your father’s name?”

“Langley! How can you forget his name?” Sylvia was emotional.

Han Xiao opened the mercenary group panel and glanced through it. There really was this name in the mission resume. It was a partnership mission with the Purple Gold Army, to eradicate the stronghold of a certain rebel army. The leader of the rebels was called Langley, and as it turned out, that guy was Sylvia’s father.

Han Xiao was speechless. He had become the ‘certain mercenary group’ that imprisoned Sylvia’s father in her character background. What could he say? This was the result of the butterfly effect once again. It fell from the sky.

“Not only you but Purple Gold Army too. This will not be the last time; I will hunt you people to the depths of hell!” Sylvia yelled.

Bang!

As soon as she finished her sentence, the sound of a smoke grenade exploding came from behind them. Dark red poison gas rose from within.

They turned around hastily and saw that the captain had already put on a gas mask. He was the one that threw out the gas grenades.

At the same time, the announcement from the spaceship system echoed in the entire spaceship.

“Auto-Navigation altered. Current destination: The closest Fixed Star. Heating up jumping engine. Estimated time till arrival: 13 minutes and 48 seconds.”

“The entire ship has entered lockdown mode; all gates are locked! Repeat, all gates are locked!”

Boom!

The gate in the main control room closed with a loud band, together with all the doors along the corridor and paths in the spaceship. The captain had prepared long ago. He dashed out extremely quickly before the alloy door on the other side of the main control room closed. Herlous could not capture the captain in time, and he punched the metal door, leaving a shallow dent.

The central alloy door divided a small part of the crowd and blocked them outside, including Sylvia.

Now, Han Xiao and the others were all trapped inside the main control room.

The crew was all stunned. The captain was with an enemy‽ 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Whoosh.

This time, clouds of dark red poison gas sprayed out from the ventilation pipe. The ventilation system had been modified, and now the hidden system was activated by the ‘captain’.

Han Xiao held his breath, and his eyes flickered.

This was not just an assassination; this ship itself was a complete trap for them! The reason that Sylvia knew their whereabouts was most likely because of how well known they were.

This time, a new mission appeared on the interface.

“Tsk tsk, they actually plotted against us and plan to send us into a Fixed Star and burn us to a crisp. Not a bad idea.”

Han Xiao smiled. He did not panic at all; he was extremely familiar with this kind of plan. He had fought the Germinal Organization this way back then.

“What do we do now?” Herlous looked at him. He could breathe and talk as usual because his END was more than 280, so the poison gas could not hurt him.

“Her plan is quite interesting, but she missed a very important factor...”

The mechanical suit expanded from his necklace to his entire body. His helmet filtered the poison gas, and his ‘Poisoned’ state was gone in no time. Han Xiao walked in front of the main control panel, pressed on the screen, and opened the spaceship system interface. He stretched his fingers, shook his head, and laughed.

“I’m a Mechanic.”
