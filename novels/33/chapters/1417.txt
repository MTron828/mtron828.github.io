Chapter 1418 Han Xiao: Thank You for Delivering a Trump Card

The World Tree Blessed Races lost in the secondary dimension battlefield, and the alliance army that was originally fighting at the frontline of the Flickering World also stopped attacking and temporarily retreated. Compared to the danger of fighting in the shallow layer dimension, the defensive perimeter of the Flickering World border was impregnable. With this wave of attacks, many of the shallow layer dimensions were riddled with holes. Although they managed to repel the enemies, the damage was not small because the battlefield was in the territory controlled by the three Universal Civilizations. A portion of the territory was destroyed, and the three Universal Civilizations quickly cleaned up the battlefield and repaired all kinds of war facilities.

Han Xiao, on the other hand, withdrew his abilities and left a portion of his mechanical army to help clean up the battlefield. He then used remote projection to meet with the leaders of the three Universal Civilizations.

As soon as Han Xiao arrived, he heard a round of bootlicking.

“Black Star, you’ve worked hard!”

“Luckily, we repelled the World Tree Blessed Races. If we let the enemy destroy our territory in the secondary dimension, we would have been in a passive position and would have dragged down the battlefront of the main universe. This was all thanks to you. We thank you on behalf of the entire Galactic Society.”

“I didn’t expect the World Tree to also have Transcendent Grade combat power, but it’s still not as strong as you. We trusted the right person.”

Han Xiao raised his brows and looked at the three of them. They had friendly smiles on their faces, and their attitude was even friendlier than before. “Alright, alright, stop bootlicking.”

Han Xiao did not feel anything.

He knew the three of them too well. They were just afraid of his Transcendent Grade strength, so they were not stingy with the praises and wanted to gain favorability with him.

Hearing this, the three of them did not speak anymore. Marbruce asked curiously, “You fought with the World Tree’s Transcendent. How do you feel? Is there any pressure?”

Han Xiao shook his head and said,

“The World Tree’s Transcendent is called the Tree God, and it doesn’t seem to be a single life form. It might be an individual created through some form of fusion. I realized that its combat power wasn’t at its peak. I am guessing that the Tree God’s bad state is related to the two Tree Kings being sealed...”

He briefly explained his discovery.

“In that case, it seems like you did a good job sealing the Heart Tree King back then. You have foresight,” Louis praised.

Han Xiao waved his hand. “Don’t be too happy yet. Although I can deal with the Tree God, it will be very difficult to kill him. His regeneration ability is as amazing as mine, and he can turn illusory and return to the inside of the World Tree at any time, as agile as me.”

“It can’t be, doesn’t that mean he is just as disgusting as you... Ahem, I mean, tricky...” Marbruce quickly coughed and changed his words.

Han Xiao rolled his eyes.

“Anyway, the Tree God is not easy to deal with. However, I feel that this ability cannot be used casually. There should be a price to pay. Otherwise, they would have used the Tree God to kill everyone ten years ago.”

The three of them nodded and looked at each other as if they had come to an agreement.

“Black Star, we have an idea, or rather, a request. We hope that you can temporarily guard the secondary dimension alone.”

Han Xiao raised his brows. “You mean, other than the fleet, I will be the only high-level combatant in the entire shallow layer dimension? No matter how many Beyond Grade As the World Tree sends out, I’ll deal with them alone?”

“With your ability, one person is equivalent to hundreds of Beyond Grade As. There’s no need for the other combatants to stay here. We believe in your ability. You can guard the secondary dimensional battlefield alone!”

Marbruce’s tone was serious, and his words had the meaning of ‘we have high hopes for you’. Han Xiao curled his lips. “If I didn’t know that you guys don’t dare to have an internal conflict now, I would have thought that you guys are trying to trick me.”

“You must have misunderstood us. We’re not like that.” The three of them looked helpless.

“I think you guys misunderstood your own image. When did you become human?”

Han Xiao shrugged and said casually,

“Alright, since you guys want me to hold the fort alone, I will guard the secondary dimension alone. It’s not difficult anyway.”

Because the World Tree’s main body was rooted in the secondary dimension, this was the main battlefield to further resist the foreign enemies. Han Xiao had originally planned to wait here for the opportunity.

This time, Han Xiao suddenly thought of something, and his tone became serious. “Speaking of which, the time when the World Tree discovered the expeditionary army outposts was a little coincidental. It happened not long after the appearance of the Pivotal Snake. I suspect that the two are related.”

Hearing this, the three of them instantly perked up.

“What are your guesses? Share them.”

“I’ve told you about the Pivotal Snake’s ability. When it matures, it will be able to track the location of the World Tree’s main body. Therefore, I suspect that there is a two-way connection between the World Tree and it. With the World Tree’s maturity, it might be able to sense the Pivotal Snake’s location. Therefore, the outposts were exposed.”

“Then what do you plan to do?” The three of them were slightly shocked.

Since I’m guarding the secondary dimension, I can also protect this key trump card, the Pivotal Snake, and bring it with me. No matter how the World Tree attacks, they will have to get past me first.

Han Xiao paused before continuing. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

As for how to prove this point, it will depend on what the World Tree does next. If they have the information about the Pivotal Snake, they will know that they are on the passive side, and they will definitely go crazy and strengthen their attacks, not caring about the losses, all for the sake of time... They don’t have to do this just because I have shown extraordinary combat strength, so once the World Tree shows signs of this, it would mean that my guess is correct.

“Good idea. Let’s do it your way.” The three of them relaxed and expressed their trust.

After discussing the follow-up plan for a while, Han Xiao deactivated the projection and returned to his room.

He first went to check on the status of the Pivotal Snake. The Pivotal Snake did not get involved in the battle and remained indifferent to him.

The Realmless King, who had already been promoted to a stockman from the trash station owner, was even more respectful, indicating that he would play with the snake seriously.

Leaving behind more Mechanical Oracles to protect the Pivotal Snake, Han Xiao then changed into the King and teleported back to the main universe, arriving at the Siebert Fortress at the border of the Flickering World.

He easily found a group of mascots, and without a word, used a combo attack ‘crouching dragon touch Feidin’. After getting enough luck, Han Xiao closed the door and opened the interface to complete the Tree God’s challenge mission.

The format of the mission was the same as the Beyond Grade A Challenge mission, with the duration as the rating, but the reward was many times higher.

The two of them had fought for a long time, and he had already unlocked all the levels of rewards. The experience reward that he had accumulated from this mission had replaced (Ending the Darkness) to become the highest experience gain mission that he had ever seen. It had reached a total of 2.4 Trillion Experience which was more than double the experience reward of (Ending the Darkness). In other words, it was equivalent to more than 20 Manison.

The other rewards also appeared. You have received [Character Summon Card – Tree God (Incomplete)]!

Character Summon Card – Tree God (Incomplete): (World Tree Devouring) – Devour materials or energy to convert into the power of the World Tree to replenish your energy. You can summon World Tree Roots. Usage: 0/4]

“Recovery ability? It’s so-so... However, if I used this Character Summon Card, would I be devouring things or helping the World Tree devour?”

Han Xiao scratched his head.

When he fought with the Tree God, if he used this move to summon the World Tree Roots, would the roots listen to him or the other party? Furthermore, if the World Tree saw that he could summon the roots of the World Tree, would it think that he was its half-brother ? You have received a reward: Draw one of Tree God’s Ability/Talent.

Note: Tree God is a special life form. Parts of abilities have been adjusted.

Randomizing... complete!

Please select one of the five options below as the reward.

1. (Tree King Crown – Liberation) — Ability: Merge Tree King Crowns to summon the Tree God. Liberating a Tree King Crown will increase the Tree God’s strength, but the price is the destruction of the Tree King Crown.

(Information Uniqueness—Conceptual Immortality] — Talent: As long as there are information carriers in the entire universe that record your deeds, as long as someone still recited your name, you will not completely perish. Even if your soul and body perish, you will be reborn in a certain time and space through information state disturbance.[Mental Network — World Tree] — Ability: Enter the World Tree’s Symbiotic Mental Network. No delay in communication with any life form of the World Tree regardless of the distance.(Inner Space Enhancement) — Talent: Your Inner Space is stronger and harder to break.(Information Form Obliteration] – Talent: You can ignore space restrictions and damage the other party’s Information Form base, causing damage. At the same time... Individual memory, network data, book records, and other information carriers will also be affected.

Hiss...

Han Xiao took a deep breath. “As expected, the Transcendent Grade has the ability to attack Information Form and can be used against people of the same level.”

He carefully browsed through it a few times and roughly understood the mechanism of [Information Form Obliteration). To explain it simply, it was probably to eliminate all traces of the other party’s existence in the world. Not only would everyone forget about him, but even the internet data and text records would disappear. It was specifically used to restrain [Information Uniqueness-Conceptual Immortality). It was similar to the information form of the sub-body of the Destiny’s Child. It could not be observed or spread.

As for the revival mechanism of the World Tree and the Underworld Hero Spirit, there was a high chance that they would be broken, and those who were affected would die completely. As for the Sanctum Revival, he was not sure if it would be affected.

However, this talent could not be used casually. One of the most important factors was the state of the target... Even if there was a huge difference in strength, as long as the target could resist, (Information Form Obliteration) would not work.

The simplest trigger condition was for the target to be on the verge of death or be in a state of ‘death’, or be killed by the ability user. At this time, Han Xiao also realized that this was the reason why the Secret Tree King did not dare to self-destruct. Self-destructing in front of him was equivalent to giving up on resisting, exposing his belly and letting him do whatever he wanted. However, this guy did not expect that he did not have this ability before.

“I didn’t know how to do this, but you guys personally gave this ability to me. Thank you.”

Han Xiao laughed.

After pondering for a while, he finally decided to choose [Information Form Obliteration).

Perhaps he would be able to unlock this skill by himself later on, but he had no clue at the moment. Who knew what the conditions would be for him to comprehend it?

Han Xiao had always believed that only the benefits on hand were meaningful, and this ability was the trump card that he urgently needed in the current situation.

Furthermore, he had a worry.

Han Xiao had always thought that the three Universal Civilizations had won after blowing up the World Tree’s main body in his previous life, but now that he saw that the Tree God had the [Information Uniqueness—Conceptual Immortality], would it also be used on the World Tree’s main body?

Did the three Universal Civilizations’ victory in his previous life end the war once and for all, or was it temporary peace? Did the World Tree disappear, or was it reborn somewhere?

Even though the possibility of this speculation was not high, Han Xiao felt that he had to obtain the (Information Form Obliteration) as insurance.

You have received the new talent (Information Form Obliteration]!

The next moment, a mysterious feeling appeared in Han Xiao’s mind. He turned to look at the metal table beside him.

His vision changed. He seemed to be able to see fine threads extending from the table, penetrating the wall and extending into the distance. Following these threads, he seemed to see all the information carriers related to it. He seemed to be able to see the source of the materials of this table, where they were processed, assembled, and how they were transported to this place. How many people were in contact with it...

However, when he wanted to take a closer look, these images disappeared as though it was just an illusion.

“Interesting.”

Han Xiao looked around the room. Many threads extended from the objects, which meant that they were connected to various information carriers. He had a feeling that he could cut these threads.

“I can only see the connection, but I can’t see the exact situation... If this ability is improved further, won’t it mean that I will be omniscient? Could this be the development path of a Transcendent?”

Han Xiao’s eyes sparkled.

Suddenly, he had an idea. He opened the interface, wanting to see the information connection of the interface. However, there were only two threads. One was connected to him, and the other extended indefinitely.

Han Xiao narrowed his eyes and suddenly had a bold idea.

“What will happen if I cut this... Forget it, I’d better not create trouble now.”
