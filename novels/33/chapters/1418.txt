Chapter 1419 Super Star Cluster Frustrated, Version Update

Han Xiao shook his head and retracted his (Information Form Obliteration] vision.

The ability that he drew this time was not too bad. In his mind, the Tree God was ranked third on the Good Guy List, and the second was the Germinal Organization leader.

The first place could only belong to Manison.

Speaking of which, the Tree God still has quite a lot of good stuff on it. It would be great if I could draw a few more times... However, the World Tree probably won’t use this trick on me so easily anymore. I don’t think the chances are high.

Han Xiao stroked his chin and pondered.

During this extraction, he had also seen a portion of the Tree God’s abilities from the options. Among them, (Tree King Crown – Liberation) confirmed his guess. The Tree God was indeed a product of the fusion of the various Tree Kings, and it seemed to consume a lot of energy. Since he had defeated the Tree God, the possibility of the other party using this move against him would not be high.

“However, based on the current situation, the three Universal Civilizations have turned from passive to active. They’re the ones who are on pins and needles.” Han Xiao smiled to himself.

The current situation was much better than in his previous life. Most of it came from his hard work-I am carrying the entire galactic society!

At this moment, black flames appeared in front of him and quickly formed Oathkeeper’s soul projection.

“Your Excellency Black Star, the three Universal Civilizations are cleaning up the battlefield, and our Holy Accord organization has already taken the opportunity to evacuate. We have not crossed paths much. What are your next instructions?”

Han Xiao glanced at Oathkeeper and saw how obedient he was. He could not help but laugh. “Your attitude changed very quickly. Are you afraid after seeing my heroic appearance?”

“...” Oathkeeper’s eyes twitched, but he did not speak.

There was no way he would admit it. Not in this life.

Seeing that he did not reply, Han Xiao clicked his tongue and said, “Don’t be so reserved. I still like your arrogant look.”

“... Stop joking.”

“Alright, alright, I won’t tease you anymore.” Han Xiao smiled. His expression then turned serious, and he said, “The Holy Accord has been exposed to the world this time, but I don’t plan to let you guys debut... cough, I’m talking about leaving the seclusion. Anyway, you guys can continue to return to the dark side. Without my call, you don’t have to take the initiative to participate in the battle, and you don’t have to have too much contact with the three Universal Civilizations. It’s best to communicate everything through me.”

“Then what will the association say? They will definitely ask when this batch of revivors appeared. If you keep hiding it, they might become suspicious...” Oathkeeper said.

“You don’t have to worry about that. I will explain it to them under the premise of hiding the details of the Holy Accord.”

Han Xiao waved his hands.

“Alright.” Oathkeeper nodded.

“By the way, there’s one more thing. Members of the Holy Accord can choose not to fight, but you have to contribute your technology in the secondary dimensions, such as Dimension Exile Bullets, Energy Disorder Shockwave, and so on to be used in war.”

“Alright, I’ll listen to you.”

Oathkeeper had already lost his anger from being tortured by Han Xiao, so he agreed expressionlessly.

At the same time, the Super Star Cluster Alliance was holding a meeting. The leaders of the various civilizations had complicated expressions on their faces.

“The three Universal Civilizations have repelled the secondary dimensional invasion of the World Tree... How fierce.”

“At this rate, the three Universal Civilizations will be able to stop the enemy outside the territory of the explored universe. The situation will not be chaotic.”

“If that’s the case, we won’t be able to carry out the plan...”

The leaders did not know what to say.

The Super Star Cluster Alliance had originally planned to leave the explored universe with their entire civilization while the three Universal Civilizations were busy fighting the World Tree Civilization.

However, from the looks of it, the three Universal Civilizations had not fallen into a hard battle at all. They were very stable!

It was all Black Star’s fault. He did not even give them a chance to start their plan! “Sigh, leaving the explored universe is one of the few opportunities for us to develop freely. Let’s continue watching and hope that the World Tree is more reliable.”

The Star Arc Leader sighed helplessly.

This plan was very important to the Super Star Cluster Alliance. Even if the current situation was disadvantageous, they would not give up easily, but it was inevitable for them to feel depressed. A civilization leader narrowed his eyes and said in a low voice, “Maybe we can help the World Tree...”

However, before he could finish, the Star Arc Leader glared at him and scolded, “Don’t drag us down if you want to die! If we’re found out, we’re dead!”

He could not believe that someone would suggest such a suicidal idea.

No matter how much they wished for the World Tree to disrupt the situation, they could only silently cheer for the World Tree and passively wait for the situation to change. How could they give any substantial help? Wouldn’t that be colluding with the enemy? Speaking of this, the Star Arc leader was furious. Your World Tree is so impressive, I thought you could beat up the three Universal Civilizations, but you can’t even get past Black Star.

How could they even talk about invading?

What a joke!

A few days later, the victory in the shallow layer dimensions was quickly spread throughout the galactic society under the push of the three Universal Civilizations. Although they agreed to Han Xiao’s request and did not emphasize the battle between him and the Tree God, it still made the galactic residents very excited. Originally, when they heard the news of the World Tree invading from the secondary dimension, most of the galactic residents were filled with fear and panic. They only heaved a sigh of relief when they saw the three Universal Civilizations successfully defeating the enemy. They became even more excited, and their confidence in the three Universal Civilizations winning this war increased.

Because they felt that staying in the explored universe was much safer, the level of chaos on various planets had also been greatly reduced. Many galactic residents had settled down, and the frequency of demonstrations had decreased. There were also fewer people running away, making it easier for the administration.

The sudden appearance of the Holy Accord Revivors this time made them an important contributor to the war. However, they left after the battle and did not communicate with the three Universal Civilizations. Their actions were very mysterious and aroused the curiosity of the galactic residents.

On the internet, many galactic residents recognized some of the people based on the Wayne Card combination. They were all famous Beyond Grade As in history.

Thus, all the clues pointed to Black Star, who grasped the Sanctum Revival. Countless galactic residents were passionately thinking about it, and various versions of their speculations were circulating on the internet.

The main planet of the Beyond Grade A Association, conference hall.

All the Beyond Grade As gathered together and stared at Han Xiao.

“Black Star, you have to give us an explanation. Who are those revivors?”

“Exactly! You’ve been hiding it from us for too long.”

“This must have something to do with you. If you say you don’t know, I’ll ignore you for a month!”

Most of the people who questioned him were Beyond Grade As of the current era, but Beiger, who knew the truth, and the rest of the revivors did not say anything and just watched the show.

“Cough, that...” Kasuyi raised his hand slightly and coughed.” Actually, I also know a little about this.”

As soon as he said that, everyone’s eyes turned sharp and focused on him.

No way, you knew about it in advance when Black Star first revealed the Sanctum Revival. How did you know about this too? You even helped Black Star hide it from us?

In the past, when we saw your heavy facial features, we felt that you had a lot of experience, so we chose you to be the vice president. Now, it seems like you have already completely turned into Black Star’s image!

Sierron, who was standing at the side, was jealous and envious. We’re all vice presidents, so why do you know so many secrets? Why am I kept in the dark like a fool? You guys are treating me like a decoration!

Damn it, I can also be a trusted aide. I also want to be in the same boat as Black Star!

Han Xiao was surprised. He turned to Kasuyi and asked, “When did you know?”

“I guessed.”

Kasuyi smiled in embarrassment.

During the training period, Han Xiao once entered the Sanctum and got Oathkeeper to contact Kasuyi.

Although Oathkeeper did not reveal anything about the Holy Accord, Kasuyi’s first impression was that Oathkeeper was Han Xiao’s secret subordinate outside. After some deduction, he guessed that Han Xiao might have a backup plan and might have hidden a batch of revivors. Therefore, Kasuyi was not surprised that the Holy Accord organization had appeared. Instead, he felt that it was ‘as expected’.

Han Xiao thought about it for a while and guessed where Kasuyi had learned it from. He did not mind and turned around to look at everyone else.

“I originally planned to explain this to everyone. Back then, when the three Universal Civilizations clashed with the association, I specially got a group of revivors to hide and form a special group. If anything happened to us, we would have a way out and also have ways to counter the enemy, so don’t blame me for hiding it.

“You all know what happened after that. The World Tree suddenly invaded, and we made peace with the three Universal Civilizations and fought against the enemy together, so I kept this trump card hidden. Not long ago, the secondary dimensional battlefield was in danger, so I sent them out to help.”

Everyone nodded in agreement.

However, Sun Hunter asked casually, “Since they’re exposed, why don’t they join the association?”

Han Xiao smiled. “This concerns our future development path. In my mind, a portion of the Beyond Grade As should form an organization in the dark, one in the open and one in the dark, guarding each other. Unless something big happens, they will remain in the dark. These mysterious revivors are the first batch of members. They are not simply obeying orders, they also have the idea of retiring, so this mission is very suitable for them.

I plan to keep this system as a place for Beyond Grade As to retire. Once everything stabilizes, if anyone gets tired of conflict and politics, they can choose to retire in this organization and regain their adventurer identity.”

As soon as he said that, everyone’s eyes flashed. They caught Han Xiao’s hidden meaning and could not help but look at him deeply.

It seemed like Black Star would no longer be satisfied with the association after becoming a Transcendent. When the war ended, he would most likely make use of the official position recognized by the three Universal Civilizations to do something big...

‘War is indeed the catalyst for ambition...’

Many Beyond Grade As felt this way.

However, from a personal point of view, they did not reject this point. Black Star was an ambitious leader, and it was a good thing for them.

“Then I have no objections.”

“Us too.”

“You sure have foresight.”

Everyone expressed their agreement and gave a round of praise.

Han Xiao smiled and was about to speak when the interface suddenly vibrated.

He was slightly stunned. He opened the interface and looked at the notification. His eyes lit up.

(Version 5.5 started!]

Data is being obtained... Data obtained!

Player forums have been opened.

Welcome to”Galaxy”Version 5.5 — (Age of Black Star- War of All Territories]

“Oh, this small update is finally over?”

Han Xiao immediately perked up.

The players had gone offline more than ten years ago due to a mini version update. He did not expect the cute leeks to come back at this time.

However, Han Xiao was not happy for long before his attention was attracted by the change in the name of the version.

“War of All Territories?”

Han Xiao narrowed his eyes.

According to his experience, the version update would usually be on the eve of some major event.

The situation of the three Universal Civilizations was great, and the World Tree had fallen into a passive state. However, the version had such a name. This made him feel that things were not simple.

“The name of this version refers to whose territory it is. Are we going to overthrow the World Tree, or will the World Tree attack the three Universal Civilizations like in my previous life? They are now blocked outside the border of the Flickering World, do they still have such an opportunity... Hmm, it’s best to take precautions and inspect it.”

Han Xiao’s eyes sparkled.
