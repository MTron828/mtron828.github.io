Chapter 1113 Confrontation and Negotiation

In the Ancient Star Desert, Planet Magnetic Cloud was one of the gathering grounds of the Machinery Faith. Its ground was yellowish-black, and heavy bases in the style of the Machinery Faith stood on the surface neatly, forming a ring-shaped industrial city. Around it were open mines with countless large industrial cranes. The streets of the city were well connected in all directions, all flat gray roads. Convoys of carriers rode past the pedestrians on the sides of the street wearing heavy kinetic armor one after another.

At the heart of the ring-shaped city was a tall mountain. It was sliced flat in the middle as a platform, where the temples were. On top of it was a floating island releasing a gentle artificial light.

The Machinery Faith had many followers and factions. It had no strict rules and mostly centered around the Grand Priest and the various bishops, forming fleets that traveled the universe looking for planets to migrate to. Their goal was the planets’ mines and the machinery wreckages underground, accumulating them or selling them. Therefore, most of the planets the Machinery Faith visited were just temporarily strongholds. They were somewhat like a wandering religion. The Machinery Faith did not have many fixed strongholds. Some were the subdivisions of different factions, some were long-term gathering and residential areas of the believers such as Planet Magnetic Cloud, and some were holy grounds recognized by all the believers.

Now, the heavily armed fleet of the three Universal Civilizations hovered above Planet Magnetic Cloud. The believers on the ground, however, were not surprised. They only occasionally glanced above and then got back to what they were doing. The three Universal Civilizations had already contacted the Machinery Faith. This kind of loose organization with religious factors was always hard to manage. The three Universal Civilizations did not trust in the Machinery Faith’s ability to execute their orders, so they just stationed their fleet there and used it as a trap node.

Currently, on the open platform at the top of the mechanical temple, the Grand Priest who was wearing the bishop armor looked up at the fleet above and softly murmured.

The priest beside saw this, approached him, and asked, “Grand Priest, are you worried about the three Universal Civilizations’ fleet?”

The Grand Priest shook his head and said, “We’re just a civilian organization that obeys the law. We’ve never had much contact with the three Universal Civilizations, so they won’t do anything to us. I’m glad that the three Universal Civilizations are here.” “Glad?”

“Yes, ever since the Intelligent Plague erupted, the fanatics in the religion have been growing by the day. Not only have they been studying the Virtual Mutiny Virus privately, but they even wanted to spread it. This completely goes against the Machinery Faith’s neutral stance; their twisted faith will bring disaster to the religion sooner or later. Now that the three Universal Civilizations have come, they’ve indirectly kept those fanatics obedient,” the Grand Priest mumbled.

Thinking back, it still felt quite heavy.

After the three Universal Civilizations invented the antivirus, there were even some fanatics who attempted to improve the virus and crack the antivirus so that the Intelligent Plague would continue. These madmen strongly believed that this was a great artificial intelligence revolution.

Therefore, left with no choice, he dispatched the Guards of Faith and locked these people up. However, this idea remained and was still spreading around this gathering ground. “Hmm, maybe...” The priest paused momentarily. “Even now, I still don’t understand why the three Universal Civilizations are temporarily using our gathering ground.”

“It seems to be related to the Intelligent Plague. I don’t know much either...” The Grand Priest shook his head.

Before he finished his sentence, the radar in his armor suddenly reacted.

“Abnormality detected in the planet’s magnetic field. A vortex has appeared, coordinates...”

The Grand Priest was startled. He turned and looked at the magnetic field vortex together with the priest beside him.

The magnetic field of Planet Magnetic Cloud was very special. The armor of the Machinery Faith believers here was equipped with specially made monitors of the magnetic field. At this time, they all heard the notification from the radar. The people on the streets all stopped and looked in the same direction. They quickly switched to Electromagnetic Vision so that they could clearly see the movement of the magnetic field. In their vision, in the sky far away, the magnetic field seemed to have formed a tornado, and bright light sparks appeared out of nowhere, quickly forming an energy field.

Right at this moment, something happened! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Boom!

Bright meteors suddenly flew out from the three Universal Civilizations’ fleet one after another, quickly heading to the location of the electromagnetic vortex.

Although these meteors were not large in size, they all gave off an astonishing energy presence, dragging extremely bright electrical tracks behind them that left long-lasting marks on the pupils of those watching. Those meteors made thunderous sounds while moving, as if the sky was collapsing.

“What is that?”

Including the Grand Priest, all the Machinery Faith believers on Planet Magnetic Cloud were shocked.

At this time, the first batch of meteors arrived at the electromagnetic vortex’s location and all stopped. After the flames around them disappeared, their appearance as machines appeared. They were all Lord’s Avatars of the various Beyond Grade A Mechanics.

Manison was the quickest. He looked up and glared at the electromagnetic vortex, and it stopped moving for an instant. Then, he raised his hand and grabbed toward it. The electromagnetic field at the vortex’s center was grabbed by him, and it entered into a mini triangular container the size of a human head.

The next moment, the abnormal electromagnetic vortex disappeared. The wind and the rain stopped, and the sky became bright again, as if the electromagnetic tornado just moments ago was only an illusion.

“Are those the Lord’s Avatars of Beyond Grade A Mechanics?”

Seeing this, although the Machinery Faith believers still had no idea what was going on, they were all instantly overjoyed and thrilled.

In their eyes, this many Beyond Grade A Mechanics appearing was the same as Gods descending.

However, before they could be surprised, the situation changed drastically again. Suddenly, the other Beyond Grade A Lord’s Avatars behind Manison attacked him all at the same time.

Boom boom boom!

Explosions erupted in midair and illuminated the faces of countless Machinery Faith believers.

The next second, Manison’s Lord’s Avatar flew out from the explosion and was surrounded by the others.

Seeing this, a flash of shock appeared in the eyes of every believer.

These Beyond Grade As are going to fight here? Then aren’t we witnessing a ‘Battle of Gods’?

Ten seconds prior...

Inside the three Universal Civilizations’ fleet outside Planet Magnetic Cloud, mechanical troops of the various Mechanics hovered. Some mechanical troops were surrounding their own Lord’s Avatars.

The instant the virus core escaped the quantum network, all of their consciousness arrived. The eyes of the mechanical bodies lit up one after another. “Target locked!”

As soon as Han Xiao arrived, the radar’s notification sounded beside his ear.

At the same time, a black silhouette landed from not far away. That was Manison’s avatar, and it rushed to the virus core’s material body instantly.

That old man is fast!

This thought flashed past his mind in an instant. Han Xiao was just about to use his ability, only to realize he could not use any teleportation abilities such as the Void Hyperdrive.

His pupils constricted, and he understood what was going on. Without further ado, he instantly followed after Manison’s avatar and fell toward the planet surface. Behind him were many meteors, all avatars or troops of the others.

Bang!

They passed through the atmosphere. Their high speed gave them a burning flame coat. Han Xiao stared at the target closely. The electromagnetic vortex enlarged in his sights as he quickly approached.

The virus core had just escaped the quantum network and was gathering electromagnetic energy to form its body, only to realize a group of Beyond Grade A Lord’s Avatars approaching. It gave up materializing and attempted to head back to the quantum network to flee.

However, in an instant, a dense electrical light shot out from Manison’s eyes. He had activated (Virtual Paramount]!

Weng!

The virus core’s virtual soul was instantly locked, unable to escape its shell that had yet to even form fully.

Manison’s movements were smooth without any hiccups. He quickly took out the specially made containment device and sucked the virus core in.

This containment was specially made to suppress the virus core’s abilities. It could perfectly contain it. As long as the virus core was caught in it, it would never escape.

Han Xiao’s pupils constricted. Old Man Manison got it!

However, the next instant, the other Lord’s Avatars that followed attacked at the same time. Highly dense beams passed him by and headed right toward Manison’s back.

Boom!

Manison had expected this. Layers of shields appeared and blocked the bombardment, causing violent explosions.

Using this force, he quickly got away from the others, at the same time turning toward them, with the containment that carried the virus core still in his hands.

The others surrounded and confronted Manison.

“Be careful. If you guys destroy the container, my efforts will have gone to waste.”

Manison was not angry at all and spoke calmly.

A direct member of the Federation of Light, Defender Romo, said with a deep voice, “Manison, hand over the virus core. You should know that this kind of thing can’t be leaked.”

The remote projections of the inspectors including Sidreun appeared. He said with a solemn tone, “That’s right. Your Excellency Mechanic Emperor, you’re a sensible person. The three Universal Civilizations will certainly reward you generously for capturing the virus core, but this thing cannot remain in the hands of someone else.”

“Hehe, you don’t have to be so nervous. After I’m done studying it, not only will I hand turn the virus core over, I’ll even share the technology I’ve obtained through it.”

Manison was very casual and did not panic at all.

Han Xiao did not speak. He looked around and nodded secretly. This was completely within his expectations.

In his previous life, the person who obtained the virus core had probably obtained it secretly. Now, however, the situation was completely different. The virus core was a hot potato. No matter which Mechanic possessed it, they would instantly be in a difficult situation and become the target of the rest of the Mechanics. At the same time, the three Universal Civilizations would certainly ask for the virus core from them.

The battleships were of no help in capturing the virus core, so why did the three Universal Civilizations deploy fleets at the trap nodes? Clearly, they were not there to deal with the virus core but to deal with them, the Beyond Grade A Mechanics!

The Lord’s Avatars present all had short-range hyperdrive abilities. Han Xiao even had Void Hyperdrive, but no one used it. This was because the fleet had activated spacetime stabilization anchors at the trap nodes long ago, preventing anyone from escaping.

And this was the exact reason Manison stayed to talk, or he would have escaped the moment he succeeded.

The only way to leave with the virus core was... to fight a way out!

However, although the three Universal Civilizations and the other Mechanics wanted to take away the virus core, they were worried about destroying the container, so they all held back.

The three Universal Civilizations hoped to take back the virus core from Manison through a negotiation. They were even mentally prepared for Manison to ask for an outrageous price.

“Mechanic Emperor, the Virtual Mutiny Virus is a strategic weapon that can threaten the entire universe. It will only be safe in the hands of the three Universal Civilizations. We won’t allow any risk to exist, so no matter what, we have to take the virus core today. You should know the severity of this matter.”

The inspector of the Arcane Church’s tone was firm.

Manison did not respond instantly but looked at the avatars of the other Mechanics. He then said slowly, “See that? Anyone who gets the virus core will have to face this. Are you guys still planning to fight for it?”

“Honestly, I don’t have a lot of interest in the virus core. After all, I’m not a Virtual Mechanic... However, I wouldn’t mind exchanging this for more good stuff.” Kant chuckled.

“Don’t look at me. As long as I get the virus core, I’ll regain my freedom, so I’m on the side of the church,” Mechanical Catastrophe Francisco said.

“I’ll fight for something with all I’ve got as long as there’s a chance... Teacher, you taught me that.” ‘Mechanic Empress’ Mornisa’s tone was calm.

Everyone expressed their attitude. Their reasons were different, but they all had the same resolve.

In the end, Manison’s eyes stopped on Han Xiao.

“Black Star, what about you?”

Han Xiao did not answer it directly but replied with a mocking tone, “You didn’t ask around just to chat, did you? Are you stalling for the time, or are you trying to find a temporary ally?”

Hearing this, Manison smiled. “Black Star, you know me well... That’s right, I need an ally to deal with this tough situation together. You and I both know the situation the Beyond Grade As are in. We’re on the same side. I plan to study the Virtual Mutiny Virus not only for its technology but also to add a layer of insurance for the Beyond Grade As. If you’re willing to help me, I won’t mind studying this technology together with you.” Everyone looked at Han Xiao with different emotions.

Han Xiao was not convinced at all. He casually said, “Sounds good, but I have a feeling you’ll go back on your word.”

“Hehe. You might not believe me, but I need someone to take this risk together with me. Two people having this technology suits my interests more, so this time, I will keep my word.”

“Tsk, that’s all words. No matter how good they sound, they’re just that.”

“Then, how do you want me to prove it?”

Han Xiao pointed at the container in Manison’s hands, smiled, and said, “Since you’re willing to study it together with me, who’s holding the virus core won’t make a difference. Give the device to me. I’ll take the risk, and you’ll help me to get out of this. That way, I’ll believe that you’re sincere and not just toying with my feelings.”

“I’m okay with that, but will you be willing to study it with me when it’s in your hands? How can I be sure you won’t go back on your words?” Manison asked the same thing.

“As you just said, I need someone to share the pressure too.” Han Xiao shrugged.

Manison stayed silent for a few seconds. As the atmosphere became heavier and heavier, he finally spoke slowly and shocked everyone.

“Since that’s the case... then why not?”
