Chapter 726 Psyker

Bloodshed Land and Section Zero had been fighting each other for ten years already and were extremely familiar with each other. The upcoming battle would be another exchange between both parties, and they all made their respective preparations.

The main force of Section Zero did not delay and very quickly launched an all-out assault on the final few strongholds in the Kant Star System.

Ten or so planets burned with the flames of war.

The Black Star Army fleet worked together with the other members of Section Zero to attack a few different planets. Currently, the players could not play a huge role in a galactic battle, and Han Xiao sent the players to be the vanguard force of a land assault. He placed them in the most treacherous location of the battlefield. Despite the frontlines being the most dangerous location on the battlefield, it also allowed them to gather as many kills as possible. Furthermore, their fearlessness also served the purpose of breaking through the enemy defense lines.

As for Han Xiao himself, he was situated at the core of the battlefield and followed the main troops to attack the Hyperdrive Base Station.

Their troops had the absolute advantage this time, and he did not have to infiltrate the enemy force alone. He only needed to guard the Star Diamond Grade Flagship. He watched as his allied troops slowly destroyed the enemy defense line and advanced.

In the command room from the flagship, the walls of the spaceship seemed to have been made from transparent crystals, and one could clearly view the explosions and cannon fire outside the spaceship.

A scaled projection of the entire battlefield could be seen floating in the middle of the command room, and the commander of the battle as well as his advisors were monitoring changes in the battlefield.

Han Xiao stood by the side and watched the battle.

He was not the commander of this operation, but as the most powerful fighter around, he was also a member of the core team. He guarded the command room personally and was ready to set off at any moment. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The commander and the others were currently analyzing the battlefield while Han Xiao listened by the side.

“The enemy withdrew a portion of their fleet from the other strongholds to guard their base. They are putting up a strong resistance, and we may need a long time to break through the thick defenses of the enemy.

“However, there is also a piece of good news. Because the enemy withdrew a portion of their forces from the other strongholds to guard the base, the defenses of their other strongholds have been weakened, and our forces attacking the other strongholds have the upper hand at the moment.”

Han Xiao nodded. The Hyperdrive Base Station was connected to all the strongholds and was like the heart that sent blood to the other organs. Most importantly, the moment the Hyperdrive Base Station fell, the entire defense line would also collapse.

Because his side had an advantage in the number of troops with their main force attacking the Hyperdrive Base Station, the enemy had no choice but to withdraw their forces from the other strongholds to guard the Hyperdrive Base Station. This way, it would be much easier for them to clear out the enemy strongholds.

Section Zero’s objective was to wipe out the fleets protecting the strongholds. The moment the Hyperdrive Base Station fell, the fleets of the various strongholds would definitely retreat to preserve their strength.

Thus, while the intention of their forces seemed to be an all-out assault to capture the enemy base, they were actually trying to tie down the enemy forces to allow their allies to destroy more enemy strongholds.

Han Xiao’s gaze swept past the various regions of the battlefield to find Hadavy’s location. His only job that day was to defeat Hadavy.

Han Xiao could not help but stroke his chin after realizing that Hadavy was nowhere to be found. “Isn’t he prepared to take action? Did he appear on the other battlefields?”

Perhaps Hadavy would avoid him and make use of the Hyperdrive Base Station. He could choose to reinforce the other strongholds through the wormhole since the other fleets would not have a high-level combatant capable of stopping him.

However, Han Xiao was not too worried. If Hadavy avoided him, it meant that the enemy troops would not have a high-level combatant capable of stopping him. At that time, he would be able to take action to push the enemy forces back and force Hadavy to return.

“The other divisions haven’t discovered any traces of him.” The commander shook his head. “He is still in the base. As long as he doesn’t appear, you do not need to take action. We aren’t the ones feeling anxious.”

Han Xiao nodded and opened the forums to pass the time.

The players were currently carrying out their various battlefield missions, and the forum was filled with screenshots of the battle. The players took screenshots of different enemies, bosses, and their spoils of war.

There were some players who also made live streams of the war. For example, the professional players from the various clubs did a live stream of the war in order to attract fans.

Participating in a large-scale war truly excited many of them. There was no fun without any challenges. After briefly looking through the forums, Han Xiao concluded that most players felt a sense of satisfaction from this battle.

Compared to the players from the other Star Fields who were still searching for clues regarding the Main Storyline mission, the Black Star Army had already began receiving benefits from the Main Storyline mission.

After browsing the forums for a while, the commander’s anxious voice snapped Han Xiao back to reality.

“Hadavy has appeared!”

Han Xiao’s eyes sparkled, and he closed the forums. Hadavy’s figure appeared within the assault battleships of the Black Star Army, and he was currently destroying battleship after battleship. Lagi had already gone forward to stop him, and both parties had begun fighting.

“Your Excellency Black Star, please fight him off,” the commander said with a heavy tone.

Lagi and Hadavy were currently facing each other amid the chaotic battlefield. Lagi’s staff flickered with various colors, and colorful magic spells smashed down onto Hadavy like a waterfall.

Hadavy was a close-combat main tank while Lagi was a long range damage dealer. The battle between them would naturally be one chasing while the other fled.

The battlefield between the two shifted every second, and the energy waves from their battle were like shining stars on the radar. All the battleships near them were affected by their battle.

They easily traversed over ten thousand kilometers during their short exchange, and their battle went from one corner of the battlefield to another. Hadavy grasped the right opportunity and hugged Lagi’s body. Their figures then crashed into a Section Zero battleship, and both of their bodies tumbled into the inside of the battleship. They got up instantly with their gazes locked on each other.

An ear-piercing alarm sounded from the inside of the battleship, and the defensive measures of the ship were activated fully. Various miniature floating guards, mobile artillery towers, and mechanical soldiers flooded over from the various walkways. The defensive squad of the battleship also charged over without hesitation.

The sound of mechanical activity and cluttered footsteps could be heard from the walkway behind Hadavy. Without even looking back, Hadavy threw out a punch backward.

A powerful force compressed the air within the battleship and sent it out with a powerful shockwave. As though a violent storm had blown past, the entire walkway behind him was torn to shreds, and all the guards were wiped out in an instant.

Hadavy retracted his fists and lamented as he looked at Lagi. “You truly live up to the reputation of being the vice commander of the Black Star Army. I can feel a great sense of danger from your magic, and you are definitely one of the top five mages that I have seen in my live.”

“Sigh, I should have chosen to become a Psychic instead back then. What’s the point of being a Mage? I can’t kill you, and it still takes so much effort.” Lagi let out a sigh and lowered his staff.

As Hadavy saw that Lagi did not intend to attack him, he asked with a face full of doubt, “Are you going to admit defeat?”

Lagi shook his head and replied, “I can’t kill you, and you can’t kill me. Since Black Star will be coming in a while, we might as well just wait here and save our strength.”

Hadavy had a strange look on his face. You obviously just want to avoid work!

Right at this moment, Han Xiao appeared from the large hole in the battleship. Seeing the two of them getting along peacefully, Han Xiao was stunned.

Without waiting for Han Xiao to say anything, Lagi said, “I shall hand things over to you.”

Lagi then cast a teleportation spell and disappeared without a trace.

Han Xiao was truly helpless in the face of Lagi’s laziness, and he turned around to look at Hadavy.

“You again. Why did you have to join Bloodshed Land and create trouble for me? Since you like being beaten up by me so much, you might as well let me catch you and beat you up three times a day.”

“You will only face me with killing intent if I am your enemy. Only then will the battle between us be meaningful!” The moment Hadavy saw Han Xiao, his battle intent began to burn, and he charged forward toward Han Xiao.

Han Xiao had already activated his Machinery Apostilization talent, which gave him a boost of almost a thousand attribute points. He avoided Hadavy’s charge and grabbed onto Hadavy’s arm to throw him out. A new hole was immediately created in the battleship.

Han Xiao then sent out a psionic blast and sent Hadavy flying further away before summoning his mechanical army.

A cold voice sounded in Han Xiao’s helmet.

“War system Sparta awaiting orders!”

This was an artificial intelligence created specially to control the mechanical army, and Han Xiao had named it Sparta. This name sounded as though it was made for war.

Han Xiao gave out an order for Sparta to control the mechanical army to assist him in battle. A dark cloud of mechanical soldiers then chased after Hadavy to block him.

After fighting him so many times, Han Xiao was extremely familiar with Hadavy’s abilities. Because it was extremely difficult to kill Hadavy, the focus of the mechanical army was on control

Hadavy and the mechanical army were engaged in an intense battle, and Han Xiao harassed Hadavy by the side. At the same time, he casually destroyed a few battleships nearby and harassed Hadavy through voice chat.

“Stop fighting. You can’t win anyway.”

“When are you planning to run? I will give you a chance to escape beforehand.”

“Let’s make a deal. Why don’t you stand there and allow me to fire at you a few times to vent my anger? I will face you in hand to hand combat next time. How about that?”

“Heh, how much is Bloodshed Land paying you? I will give you double if you come and work for me.”

Hadavy’s face turned darker and darker before he finally exploded. “Shut up! Focus on fighting me!”

He enjoyed facing powerful opponents to stimulate his potential and felt that he would only receive benefits from a treacherous battle that forced him to the edge.

Just when Han Xiao was prepared to continue, Jorde’s stern voice suddenly sounded in the communication channel. He and Hadavy heard everything that Han Xiao had said.

“Hadavy, use the weapon I handed over to you immediately.”

Weapon?

The enemy may have prepared some special method to deal with me.

Han Xiao immediately became alert and tightened the attack of his mechanical army. At the same time, he closely monitored all of Hadavy’s actions.

However, it was as though Hadavy did not hear anything, and he continued to fight the mechanical army.

“Did you hear me?” Jorde bellowed. “Are you going to defy orders?”

Hadavy pretended that he had not heard anything

Jorde’s voice then turned cold. “I knew that you wouldn’t listen to me.”

Hadavy suddenly had a bad premonition, and the ‘special weapon’ on his body suddenly reacted. This was a Secret Message Bead that suddenly unlocked itself automatically. A faint palm-sized ball of white light then floated out from the bead and hovered beside Hadavy.

“What is that?”

Both Han Xiao and Hadavy were taken aback.

Before the two of them could even think, the ball of white light disappeared and appeared above Han Xiao. Han Xiao had already made preparations and immediately reacted.

Void Travel!

The space around him seemed to have been frozen, and Han Xiao rapidly avoided the ball of white light. This ball of white light seemed extremely eerie, and it was best to stay as far away from it as possible.

The next moment, the ball of white light shot toward Han Xiao and could actually move in the Void Dimension as well!

Han Xiao was startled and tried his best to avoid it, but the ball of white light chased after him tightly.

Han Xiao hurriedly deactivated his Void Travel and activated a short-ranged hyperdrive to exit the battlefield. However, the white light appeared before him yet again as though it was a homing skill that would definitely hit him.

This thing can’t be avoided... Han Xiao’s gaze became solemn, and he shot at the ball of light. However, the ball of light seemed to have no physical form, and the laser beam went right through it.

Since he could not avoid it, Han Xiao activated a few psionic shield layers and welcomed the ball of light instead.

However, the many layers of shield could not even touch the ball of light, and it went straight through the shields and struck Han Xiao’s body. It then disappeared right after.

Han Xiao touched his body, and he did not seem to be injured at all.

“Just what is... urgh!”

He suddenly felt an intense pain in his head, and a notification popped up on his interface.

You have been struck with Psyker’s (Psychic Parasitic Toxin). You have received 14,860 mental damage!

You have gained the (Schizophrenia) status. Duration unknown.

You have gained the [Poisoned Soul) status. Duration unknown.

You have gained the [Sensory Misdirection) status. Duration unknown.

You have gained the [Parasitic Mind) status. Duration unknown.

Han Xiao gritted his teeth as he stared at the notifications on the interface.

The thing that shocked him the most was the attacker.

Psyker.

He was the only beyond Grade A Super in the Shattered Star Ring that Han Xiao had not met!

Psychic!

“Why would it be him?”
