Chapter 627: Black Spirit Race

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Galactic migration was a huge project.

All the surrendered Subterranean Mutants brought their Prophecy Stones onto the spaceships. Without these Prophecy Stones, even if Planet Sunil had a few small mines left, it was impossible for a large-scale Psychic Current to form again.

In other words, the calamity was over, and this planet was now suitable for the Sunils to live on.

The amount of resources that the Black Star Army could mobilize had awed the upper echelons of Sunil and made them even more respectful. Upon witnessing the arrival of the transport fleet, they did not dare delay any further and took the initiative to process the payment to the Mercenary Alliance.

Han Xiao received a notification to inform him of the funds entering his account. At the same time, the interface also notified him of the completion of the mission.

[Sunil Rescue Operation: Large Scale Employment Mission]. A large sum was deposited into your account to cover some of the transportation cost. Completing a Large-Scale Employment Mission alone has given the Black Star Army a shiny battle record and increased your credibility rating greatly. The Mercenary Alliance has once again revised their rating of the Black Star Army.

The upgrade of his summary also indicated an upgrade in his status. The happiest bunch about this upgraded reputation had got to be the players, and they all felt a great sense of accomplishment.

Apart from the official employment mission, the Grade A Sunil Mission [Eliminate Subterranean Mutants] had also been completed. The players‚Äô pockets were full of rewards, and their faces were full of smiles.

This time, Han Xiao did not pursue the highest mission rating and got a [Good] rating. According to the details of the mission, exterminating the mutant race would give him the highest rating. However, the reward of the mission could not be compared to the future benefits that migrating the mutants could bring him. Thus, Han Xiao chose the option that brought him greater benefits.

Han Xiao did not need this little mission reward anyway. In any case, the experience points that the players received from the mission would eventually become their spending power. All Han Xiao needed to do was harvest them again.

However, the Grade A mission gave him an unexpected reward, a new dungeon.

[Underground Subterranean Mutant War].

A new dungeon? Not bad. Han Xiao‚Äôs eyes lit up. He had accumulated a few dungeons, but because the players‚Äô levels weren‚Äôt high enough, he did not release them all. However, he would be able to make use of all the dungeons eventually as the players increased their levels.

Over the next few days, Han Xiao stayed behind on Planet Sunil to oversee the transportation of the Subterranean Mutants.

After the end of the employment, he also terminated the Army Assembly.

A portion of the players remained on Planet Sunil. While the employment mission was over, Planet Sunil still had tons to do, and there was plenty of benefits to be gained. Base No. 3 formed the faction headquarters on Planet Sunil, and the missions on Planet Sunil could groom the players as well.

With the crisis of Planet Sunil resolved, the Sunil warriors no longer had to take any more risks on the outside. Sehrinde and the other Sunil mercenaries wanted to return to their homeland and quit being mercenaries. As such, they all approached Han Xiao and requested to leave. All of them felt extremely guilty and felt that they had let Black Star down.

Han Xiao had already predicted such a situation and had prepared a win-win situation for both parties. He allowed Sehrinde and the others to remain on Planet Sunil without the need to go out on missions and train up the mercenaries in Base No. 3 instead.

All the Sunil warriors accepted this proposition. They truly wished to do something for Black Star to repay his kindness. Since there was no danger for them when grooming the newbies on their home planet, Sehrinde and the others no longer mentioned the matter of leaving.

Finally, the last cargo spaceship set off, and Han Xiao left together with the Black Star Army. Countless Sunils looked up into the sky to send the Black Star Army off.

...

The Subterranean Mutants were all migrated to some uninhabited planet suitable for their kind, and Han Xiao followed the cargo ships to monitor the situation.

Because all the Subterranean Mutant tribes were reorganized, they were no longer separated by distance like before. Instead, the development of the tribes was sped up, and the tribes were mixed together to live together. They had skipped an entire phase, and all the various tribes were now united.

From the angle of a civilization‚Äôs development, this was a truly frightening start.

Because the Germinal leader was Black Star‚Äôs emissary and the one who had spread the knowledge that Han Xiao had bestowed onto him, the Germinal leader became the undisputed leader of the Subterranean Mutants.

To the members of the Germinal Tribe, Black Star was like a divine being, like a messiah, to them. The Germinal Tribe‚Äôs respect of Han Xiao was spread to the hearts of all the Subterranean Mutants. After they settled down in their new residences, the Subterranean Mutants treated Han Xiao as a figure to worship.

Because of the uniqueness of the mental connection, culture could spread at an unbelievable rate, and all the mutants began to create names for themselves.

When Han Xiao arrived, the Germinal Tribe were leading the Subterranean Mutants to construct a gigantic nest. Han Xiao was greeted with an extremely warm welcome when he arrived, with the leader of the Germinal Tribe coming out to receive him personally.

‚ÄúThis is our new home.‚Äù The Germinal leader dashed into the new nest excitedly like a little child running after candy.

‚ÄúVery good. This planet shall be your land from now on.‚Äù Han Xiao nodded with a smile. ‚ÄúYou are a new civilization and shouldn‚Äôt be called Subterranean Mutants anymore.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you going to give us a new name?‚Äù the Germinal Tribe leader asked excitedly.

‚ÄúNo, this is your own right.‚Äù

After a simple conversation, Han Xiao left the planet and did not interfere with the development of the Subterranean Mutants. They were still in their infant stage, and Han Xiao planned to let the Subterranean Mutants develop naturally.

His spaceship then left the planet, and a new notification popped up on his interface.

Han Xiao was truly surprised. He had never expected to have such a reward.

Furthermore, this was not the only notification

Black Spirit Race?

Han Xiao was taken aback for a moment before coming to a realization. The Subterranean Mutants must have given themselves an official name. However, why did the Black Spirit Race sound as though it was related to his nickname?

He did not understand his position in the hearts of the Subterranean Mutants. They had made use of ‚ÄòBlack Star‚Äô as reference and named themselves the Black Spirit Race.

Han Xiao immediately became interested.

Interesting, I wonder what kind of civilization the Subterranean Mutants will develop into.

Smiling, Han Xiao piloted the Blacklight Stealth and disappeared into the sky.

...

The result of the migration was reported to the players, and after seeing the Subterranean Mutants begin their new life, many of the players heaved sighs of relief. At the same time, they could not help but feel proud for being a part of the Black Star Army.

On the forums, the Sunil incident became the hottest topic of discussion. The players enjoyed the feeling of changing the fate of an entire race and becoming saviors. Their sense of belonging toward the faction also increased greatly as a result of this incident.

On Planet Sunil, the Sunils were extremely grateful to the Black Star Army, and people went to visit Base No. 3 every day.

Sehrinde and the other ‚Äòretired‚Äô mercenaries set up an official training camp in Base No. 3 and began to accept disciples to train. Geett the lùíÇtest ùíèùíêvels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The training camp was an avenue to provide a never-ending stream of soldiers for the army. While the training camp was only starting out, it was filled with great potential. As long as the Sunils continued to reproduce normally, there would definitely be some who were willing to become mercenaries.

It could be said that as the Sunils developed, the benefits of Base No.3 would also increase. The prosperity of both parties was closely related.

After the Sunil mission, the development of the Black Star Army in the Garton Star System was finally on track.

The players who stayed behind on Planet Aquamarine gradually began to complete the test.

Finally, apart from a few new players who joined the game, all the players on Planet Aquamarine had entered the galaxy and become members of the Black Star Army. The size of the Black Star Army had also reached the one million mark.

Even among large mercenary groups, such a number was extremely rare.

The Black Star Army wanted to develop their foundations firmly in the Garton Star System and had begun to expand into many different businesses and construct new bases. Apart from trying to monopolize the mercenary market of the entire Garton Star System, Han Xiao‚Äôs hands had also stretched out into the nearby Star Systems. His connections provided him with great aid, and the speed of their development astounded Godora.

Han Xiao would occasionally personally lead a couple of high difficulty employment missions or would find some planets with benefits to be reaped with his familiarity of the storyline. Every now and then, he would take on a large-scale employment mission as the Main Storyline Mission to build cohesiveness among the players.

The Black Star Army grew steadily without any outside force interfering with their development. There was almost no risk involved, and everything went according to Han Xiao‚Äôs plan.

In the blink of an eye, two years passed.
