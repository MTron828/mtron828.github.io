Chapter 660 Legendary Point: Indestructible Body.

The Section Zero fleet left the Bloodshed Land startled. Word of the astonishing fight earlier quickly spread throughout the entire fleet. The other allies were all shocked and could not believe it. Their doubts were only cleared when they saw the video footage.

Han Xiao met with Lagi and the others. The battlefield that his troops had been in did not have an intense fight, so the damage suffered in this battle was insignificant.

After leaving the battlefield, a notification popped up on Han Xiao’s interface.

You have received 1 Legendary Point.

Han Xiao was not surprised. Back when he faced the attack of three DarkStar Calamity Grades before he was even a Calamity Grade himself, he had also received the [Battle of Three Calamity Grades] Legendary Point. Now that he had faced the eight Vanguard Officials who were much more famous, receiving a Legendary Point was expected.

Star Cluster Legendary Point (Colton Star Cluster): Indestructible Body. You fought eight Vanguard Officials of the Bloodshed Land at once, and with absolutely unquestionable results, you proved to the world that you deserved this title. Tales of this fight will be passed on by many, becoming an everlasting legend!

Indestructible Body...

Han Xiao was surprised. This had initially been a nickname given by many organizations, but now it had become official. He felt very excited for some reason.

He had finally earned a real title for himself!

Star Cluster Legendary Points increased his rewards by twenty percent, much higher than Star System Legendary Points. This was his first Star Cluster Legendary Point.

If I defeated the eight Vanguard Officials, the reward might totally be a Star Field Legendary Point.

Han Xiao shook his head. That was beyond his capabilities. All the Vanguard Officials were very tanky, too. Plus, they had cooperated with each other very well, controlling the tempo of the battle. Retreating alive was the limit of his current capabilities. Only Beyond Grade As could deal with this kind of situation with ease.” Updates by ”

On the interface, the mission was shown as completed. Han Xiao was about to contact Ralph and tell him to carry out his end of the deal, but as soon as he took out the communicator, Ralph’s communication request came first.

As soon as he picked up, Ralph instantly spoke. “Black Star, your combat capability has completely exceeded my expectations. You really did it! Although we did not win this time, you have put an end to the negative situation...”

Ralph did not hold back in praising him. Due to fear of Bloodshed Land’s strategy, the Calamity Grade Section Zero members had all been unwilling to fight. At this crucial moment, Han Xiao had been the only one that could directly restrain those enemies. Han Xiao was a straw to clutch at in his eyes. He praised him nonstop till the point that even Han Xiao was annoyed.

Han Xiao could not help but stop him.

“Stop it. There’s no need for these compliments. It’s time to complete the deal. Give me the Cutting-Edge Knowledge. I want to retreat from the battlefield temporarily.” Hearing that, the excitement on Ralph’s face froze. “You want to quit the secret war?”.

“Just temporarily. As you have seen, in order to fight the eight Vanguard Officials, my Mechanical Army was wiped out. I’m a Mechanic. Without my machines, my combat capability will decrease tremendously. Plus, I’m actually suffering from rather serious internal injuries. I’m only forcing myself not to vomit any blood,” Han Xiao said with a serious and sincere face.

“Really?” Ralph looked at Han Xiao suspiciously.

He did not look injured at all.

“What, do you want me to vomit some blood for you to see?” Han Xiao opened his mouth and looked like he was about to vomit.

“Alright, alright, I believe you.” Ralph quickly stopped him. He felt that Black Star might really be heavily injured.

Thinking about it, he had fought against the eight Vanguard Officials. Plus, he had been hit by a Beyond Grade A standard attack; it was normal for him to pay a price for it.

Han Xiao paused and explained, “I need to rest for some time. Cutting-Edge Knowledge is extremely complex. I will need half a month... Hmm, a month to learn it.”

Ralph nodded. Cutting-Edge Knowledge was indeed very complex.

“Also, I need time to rebuild my Mechanical Army. This will be a huge project. I won’t be able to utilize my full potential if I don’t rebuild it, so it would be meaningless even if I did continue to take part in the battles.”

“Er... I suppose.” Ralph was in a dilemma. “But if you quit, we really won’t have the ability to fight back in terms of high-level combatants. As you know, the other members are not really contributing at all.”

Han Xiao shrugged, as if saying, I’ve done what I could.

He shook his head and said, “As you’ve seen, I can’t change the war alone, and this battle has proved that. Even though I held back the Vanguard Officials, the fleet wasn’t able to penetrate into the Bloodshed Land’s stronghold. Compared to Bloodshed Land, our alliance fleet looks like an amateurs. The way I see it, the Bloodshed Land will almost definitely succeed in their invasion.”

After two battles, Ralph was rather pessimistic. He asked, “What thoughts do you have?”

“I think that at the start of the secret war, Bloodshed Land will gather their forces to create the first batch of strongholds,” Han Xiao said in a sincere tone. “It will be exceedingly difficult for us to stop that from happening. However, Bloodshed Land will have to split their forces to build more strongholds in order to invade the several Star Systems near the borders. This will cause their forces to split up. At that time, maybe Section Zero will have a chance to counterattack.”

Although he did not know the details from the version update, he still remembered what the situation of the secret war had been at the later stages during Version 3.0. From that, he could deduce Bloodshed Land’s advantages during the earlier stages.

The march of Bloodshed Land was unstoppable. He wanted to retreat now because he did not want to get thrashed by the opponents in the earlier stages.

Ralph contemplated for a while. In the end, he could only admit that what Han Xiao had said made a lot of sense. That might really turn out to be how things developed. He suddenly felt powerless and asked, “You’re right-do you have any suggestions?”

“I feel that the most important matter at the moment is the fact that the high-level combatants of Section Zero are avoiding battles. We shouldn’t have unrealistic fantasies about chasing all the enemies away. It’s best to stop when suitable to avoid larger damage. The time to counter-attack has yet to arrive. What we need to do now is strengthen our forces till that moment arrives.”

Star Cluster Civilizations were not short on resources. In order to stop Bloodshed Land, Purple Crystal could use these resources to increase the strength of the Section Zero members. As for Han Xiao, who had already shown his value, if the Purple Crystal Civilization took his advice, he would receive even more benefits.

Ignoring the Great Mechanic Han’s ulterior motive, this suggestion did make sense. At least, this was a feasible strategy for Ralph.

“I will pass on your suggestion to the commanding department and let them analyze it.” Ralph paused before sighing. “As for your request, I will approve it... I have only one requirement. When you have recovered fully, you have to return to the battlefield immediately.”

“Of course. When will you give me the Cutting-Edge Knowledge?”

“I will give you a knowledge list later. You can pick it for yourself. By the way, the resources to make up for your loss will also be handed to you as soon as possible.”

Han Xiao smiled.

With the Cutting-Edge Knowledge that he was soon going to receive, he would be able to complete his Class Advancement mission. One of the bigger goals of joining the secret war had already been achieved.

Han Xiao had taken a shortcut, so he did not have to spend too much time farming Favorability. This act of holding back the eight Vanguard Officials alone was unduplicatable; the Vanguard Officials had now discovered that he was very difficult to kill, so they would not waste their energy fighting him together. This time, it brought Han Xiao fame, and the Vanguard Officials would definitely not make the same mistake next time.

Han Xiao was extremely tanky, but his actual combat capability was not that extraordinary. One or two Vanguard Officials would be able to restrain him. What had happened that day would never happen again.

In order to become stronger, he needed to continue leveling up as well as build new machines using the Cutting-Edge Knowledge as the core.

After closing the communication, Ralph sent the knowledge list over.

There was a total of sixty Mechanic knowledges, twenty from Armed, Energy, and Control Branch each. These knowledges were grouped into five levels —basic, advanced, and high-level knowledges made up forty-five of the sixty knowledges. There were only fifteen Cutting-Edge Knowledges and Ultimate Knowledges in total. The fact that there were so few of them showed how extremely valuable they were.

There were nine types of Cutting-Edge Knowledges, three from each of the branches. Even Purple Crystal did not have all the Cutting-Edge Knowledges, just some of them.

Han Xiao was a Virtual Mechanic. The Potential Point cost for learning Control Branch Cutting-Edge Knowledges was normal, but it would cost triple the Potential Points to learn Cutting-Edge Knowledges from the other two branches.

Yet, Han Xiao did not choose the Control Branch Cutting-Edge Knowledge but an Energy Branch Cutting-Edge Knowledge.

[Abnormal State Energy]!

This was a must-learn knowledge for any Mechanic after Class Advancement. It could be considered an evolutionary knowledge for Mechanics.

After learning this knowledge, only then would the Mechanics be able to harvest, extract, and use psionic and antimatter energy on a large scale!

Energy was the core of machines. The change in energy technology would bring tremendous changes!

Han Xiao had been waiting for this knowledge for a very long time. He had saved his Potential Points so that he could afford the triple cost.

Since he did not have to take part in the upcoming battle, Han Xiao took his people and left, heading back to the base in the Garton Star System.

The other Section Zero members were envious, seeing that the Black Star Army was leaving, but none of them had a problem with it.

Black Star had taken a huge risk in this battle. He did indeed have the right to go back and rest. The others could only watch as the Black Star Army departed.

...

The second fight between Purple Crystal and Klent had ended. The other five Star Cluster Civilization that had been paying attention to the secret war received the battlefield report very soon. Those superiors could almost not believe their own eyes.

Black Star had fought the eight Vanguard Officials alone and survived almost unharmed?

Really?

This news thunderously appeared on the desk of the various organization leaders and stirred up a storm in their social circle!

The seven Star Cluster Civilizations, Bloodshed Land, and the other huge organizations all reevaluated Han Xiao.

Originally, in their eyes, Black Star was most famously known as Ames’ trustworthy subordinate and secondly known for his network. Black Star’s position in their social circle had basically come from these two titles. However, these organizations did not consider his combat capability to be anything notable. On average, their assessment of him wasBlack Star is a rather strong Calamity Grade, but he’s not overwhelmingly strong among those of the same grade.

However, this news shattered all the opinions of these organizations concerning Han Xiao.

According to his performance in this battle, the seven Star Cluster Civilization and the various organizations reevaluated his strength. “In the universe, fighting alone isn’t popular. Many people have to face more than one opponent of the same grade at the same time. It’s known that Mages and Mechanics are the two types of Supers that are most capable of fighting more than one enemy of the same grade.

“Black Star is a Mechanic, but his way of fighting more than one enemy is different.

“Mechanics have shared weakness—their physical body isn’t strong enough. Other than some Mechanics that use single unit combat suits, most Mechanics are afraid of the enemies closing the distance. However, Black Star has an unbelievable physique. His endurance is extremely high, and he has an almost Esper ability level recovery speed. The strategy of closing the distance on him will be turned into a trap by him instead. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“He’s a special Mechanic. Even if he loses his machines, he will still have a very high combat capability with his physique. Dragging out the battle is his strength-he’s able to make the battles long enough to make more than ninety percent of the Calamity Grades exhausted and powerless.

“From the machines that Black Star has showcased, it’s clear that he has yet to master the use of psionic energy. As soon as he starts to use psionic as the energy core, with his terrifying physique, Black Star’s strength will multiply many times. He will undoubtedly become one of the very few people that stand at the top of Calamity Grades.

“According to the intelligence above, it’s strongly recommended to move him into the (Shattered Star Ring Beyond Grade A Seed Observation List]...

“Black Star has the potential of reaching Beyond Grade A!”

The Beyond Grade A Seed List was on an entirely new level from the usual Calamity Grades. The Star Cluster Civilizations paid attention to everyone on this list. Every name represented someone extremely talented with the potential to become a Beyond Grade A.

This was not only determined by potential but also strength, growth speed, special talent, race, ability type, and many other factors.

This list covered the entire Shattered Star Ring.

However, there were a few dozen people on the list!
