Chapter 1414 Ambush

Without looking back, Han Xiao casually replied, “As you can see, these are all reinforcements that I’ve pulled over to fill the gap in our combat strength.”

The church head knocked on the table with his knuckles and said with a deep voice, “Don’t play dumb. I’m asking how they got here. When did you revive these people?”

Hearing this, Han Xiao then turned around and glanced at the three of them.

“Do you think all the revivors are willing to appear in public? I never said that the ones in the association are all the revivors there are. As for who exactly I revived, I have no obligation to tell others. Don’t ask what you shouldn’t ask.”

The three of them choked and looked at him deeply.

They did not need to think too much to guess that this was Black Star’s backup plan. There was probably a group of revivors hidden in the dark, which was most likely arranged during the confrontation back then as a trump card against the three Universal Civilizations. If they had decided to carry out the purge back then, the result would have been hard to determine. Now that Han Xiao had just revealed this trump card, the three of them were shocked.

However, after knowing him for so many years, the three of them had a deep understanding of Black Star’s unfathomable habits. They were already used to Black Star setting up spies everywhere. Perhaps this group of revivors that had suddenly appeared was just the tip of the iceberg of his hidden force...

The three of them looked away with heavy hearts.

This was not the time to be bothered about such things, the three of them were still more respectful toward Han Xiao. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Now that Black Star was on the same level as them, the three of them saw that he did not want to explain and so they did not continue asking.

Furthermore, compared to the importance of Black Star himself, having another batch of revivors did not seem like a big deal. With Han Xiao, who was a Transcendent, the impact these hidden revivors had on the three of them was limited.

Of course, Han Xiao would not take the initiative to explain the origin of the Holy Accord. Looking at the three of them, he could not help but smile.

Back then, he had hidden the strength of the Holy Accord organization to leave a path of retreat for the association, allowing the Beyond Grade As to be divided into two parts —the open and the dark.

He had originally planned to reveal the tip of the iceberg of the Holy Accord at the right time and make the three Universal Civilizations wary. However, his plans could not keep up with the changes. Now that he had stepped into the Transcendent Grade, the deterrence of a single person was comparable to the entire Beyond Grade A group. The Holy Accord Revivors trump card was not as important as before. However, it was still useful. It was not a bad thing to make the three Universal Civilizations warier.

Han Xiao paid attention to the battle once again. After watching for a while, he suddenly locked onto the Secret Tree King and Clotti who were fighting on the surveillance screen. “My prey has appeared. Excuse me.” The remote projection disappeared.

Only at this moment did the three Universal Civilizations’ leaders relax. They looked at each other and saw the fear in each other’s eyes.

In a certain war zone in the shallow layer dimension battlefield.

Bang!

The rainbow-like magic light penetrated the surging dark energy and landed on Clotti’s body, leaving a new wound. The powerful annihilation force sent him flying, crashing into the dark brown ground and smashing through hundreds of layers.

“Cough cough...”

The cells in his body withered under the influence of the Annihilation spell. Clotti quickly used his energy to stabilize his injuries before looking up at the enemy in the sky with a grave expression.

The Secret Tree King was floating in the air, looking down at him from above. Forbidden Spells were brewing around him, rapidly taking shape and falling like a storm.

Clotti gritted his teeth to suppress his injuries and manipulated the dark energy to meet the attack. However, the stalemate only lasted for an instant before he was sent flying once again, with many new wounds on his body.

“This Tree King... is too strong...”

Clotti clutched his wound, his eyes shining with shock.

He had judged the strength of the Tree King from the Subduing Tree King, the Heart Tree King, and the Lord’s Avatar of the Fortitude Tree King. He had thought that even if he could not defeat this new Tree King, he would at least be able to hold on for a long time. However, Clotti did not expect that this guy who called himself the Secret Tree King was stronger than the other three. He was the National Pillar, but the other party beat him like beating a younger brother. It was easy and relaxed.

Among all the opponents that he had fought, only Black Star and Wuornos could deal with him so easily.

If the other Beyond Grade A Mages were just ordinary magic cannons, then this Secret Tree King was a rapid nuclear bomb. The strength, frequency, and speed of his casting far exceeded all the Mages that Clotti had ever

seen!

In the sky, the Secret Tree King temporarily stopped attacking. He moved his fingers and casually played with a ribbon made of magic power.

“You actually dared to fight me one on one. Should I say that your courage is commendable, or you are overestimating yourself? Unfortunately, only that Mechanic or that Esper has the qualifications to fight me. Your strength is a little too weak. If this continues, I won’t have any interest in killing

you...”

The only opponents that the Secret Tree King cared about were Han Xiao and EsGod. Although Clotti’s combat strength was not low, and his dark energy control Esper Ability was rather penetrative, it was not much of a threat to him, a Mage who grasped multidimensional energy. Feeling the other party’s contempt, Clotti’s face darkened. He silently gathered his energy and prepared to go all out.

However, right at this moment, a spatial fluctuation appeared in their senses. The space wall in the distance opened up, and a figure covered in a hooded black robe appeared. His clothes fluttered in the wind, and the edges of his clothes were like black flames. He was brimming with the aura of a peak Beyond Grade A, attracting their attention.

“Who are you?” Clotti turned around. He did not know if he was friend or foe, but he immediately became more alert.

“We’re on the same side.”

Oathkeeper glanced at him before staring at the Secret Tree King.

“Another one?” The Secret Tree King narrowed his eyes. “You’re in cahoots with those new reinforcements, right? You should be their leader. Interesting, you still have a group of high-level combatants hidden... Heh, so what? You can’t turn the situation around. Sooner or later, we’ll wipe out all your forces in the secondary dimension world!”

Through the mental network, he had already found out about the Holy Accord Revivors reinforcing the three Universal Civilizations’ Beyond Grade As.

In the eyes of the Secret Tree King, facing an opponent like the World Tree, the three Universal Civilizations should have felt immense pressure and gone all out long ago. However, the other party was still holding back even now. It was truly unfathomable.

Furthermore, with the Secret Tree King’s personality, he was a little unhappy about this... Why, is our World Tree not worthy of your full strength ?

Ignoring the Secret Tree King, Oathkeeper communicated with Clotti telepathically.

“Leave this to me. Go help the others.”

“Can you do it? This Tree King is very strong. We’d better work together to deal with him.” Clotti expressed his doubts. “This Tree King is a Mage, and I can see that his spells have bonuses in the secondary dimension world. I should not be his match, but I only need to stall him. In this aspect, I’m more suitable than you. There’s no need to waste combat power on him.”

Oathkeeper responded.

Not long ago, the expeditionary army outposts had been attacked, and Han Xiao had finally informed the Holy Accord Organization to take part in the battle. Many of the Holy Accord Revivors had already prepared themselves mentally. They did not need any mobilization and set off on their own. On one hand, it was for the sake of the Sanctum Revival qualifications, and on the other hand, it was also because they were in the same boat.

Other than that, Han Xiao also requested the Holy Accord to bring along Dimensional Exile Bullets, High-Level Lifeform Energy Disorder Shockwave, cross-dimensional detection radars, and other special technologies to provide support. Oathkeeper had no choice but to do as he was told. As the Holy Accord organization’s troops had always been on standby, they quickly came over.

Clotti did not respond, but at this moment, the Secret Tree King suddenly attacked. All kinds of powerful forbidden spells were cast continuously, firing at the two of them.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Magical lights flashed in the sky, beautiful and deadly. Oathkeeper and Clotti immediately reacted and moved around, dodging nonstop.

On the other side, the Secret Tree King was multitasking. While quickly constructing spell models and casting forbidden spells, he communicated with the Ancestral Tree King through the mental network.

“There’s no sign of that Mechanic in the frontline battlefield or the secondary dimension battlefield. He has that sealing ability, so there’s a high chance that he’s targeting a tree king. Therefore, his target should be me. Maybe he’s secretly observing. After I fight these two opponents for a while, he should jump out and ambush me.”

Hearing this, the Ancestral Tree King expressed his approval in the mental network and said with a deep voice, “Your judgment is very reasonable. Continue fighting. As long as that Mechanic is lured out, I will immediately descend and catch him off guard.”

“Okay.”

The two of them quickly came up with a plan. They planned to use the Secret Tree King as bait to lure the snake out of its hole.

The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind. Since it was very likely that Black Star had his eyes on the Secret Tree King, the Ancestral Tree King also chose to launch an ambush. He had two goals. One was to find an opportunity to kill Black Star, and the other was to think of a way to save the Heart Tree King. If he did not deal with Black Star, how could he talk about unsealing the Heart Tree King? At the very least, he had to snatch that Universal Treasure with the sealing ability.

It was not that he thought too highly of the Heart Tree King. Even the simple-minded Subduing Tree King had ‘decisively’ self-destructed twice to escape from being sealed. Only the Heart Tree King had been affected. The Ancestral Tree King only wanted to take back the sealed Tree King Crown. Otherwise, there would always be a gap in the five Tree Kings. With Oathkeeper joining the battle, the two of them were finally at a stalemate with the Secret Tree King. The three of them fought intensely, chasing each other non-stop. The battlefield changed again and again. One moment, it was an abyss-like blackish-purple space, then it was a holy land-like silver kingdom, then it was a nascent dimension born in the void, and the next moment, it was an unstable secondary dimension at its end. Without exception, every battlefield was shattered by the aftershock of their battle, and batches of fleets were devoured by the space storm.

The three of them arrived at a shadow dimension. Suddenly, the space wall in the distance opened, and another figure entered the battlefield. It was Han Xiao.

The Secret Tree King noticed Han Xiao at first glance and immediately ignored the other two opponents. He stared at Han Xiao with a strong battle intent and killing intent in his eyes.

“You’re finally willing to come out ?”

Han Xiao glanced at him, waved his hand, told Oathkeeper and Clotti to stop and retreat to the side, then spoke to the Secret Tree King in the public channel.

“There are three of us here. Aren’t you going to run?”

“Run? Who do you think I am ?”

The Secret Tree King suddenly waved his palm, and an invisible spatial fluctuation swept across this space. The entire secondary dimension instantly turned into a mirror-like space, as though it was trapped in a crystal. The images of the battlefield were flowing in the sections of the space, overlapping and dazzling. The spatial barrier suddenly formed, isolating Clotti and Oathkeeper in the outside world. They could only see what was going on inside the barrier, but they could not participate in it. It was as if the two of them were in parallel spaces that had no intersection.

Inside the barrier, only the Secret Tree King and Han Xiao were looking at each other. “You want to fight me one on one?” Han Xiao looked around at the barrier and smiled strangely.

“I’ve always wanted to fight you, so why would I run? I thought you would launch a sneak attack, but I didn’t expect you to appear so openly... However, this doesn’t matter. This barrier is our battleground. If you have the ability, don’t use that teleportation technique to escape. I’ll definitely kill you today!”

The eyes of the Secret Tree King flickered. He knew that Black Star had the teleportation technique that could ignore crowd control, so this barrier was only to prevent the other enemies from disrupting the battle and create the illusion of a one-on-one battle. As long as Black Star did not teleport away and stayed behind to fight him one-on-one, the plan would be half complete.

He did not hesitate and immediately cast all kinds of spells toward Han Xiao. On the surface, it seemed like he was going to fight Han Xiao one on one, but he had already secretly used spells to guide the Ancestral Tree King into the barrier, preparing to launch a pincer attack.

However, before the spell could hit its target, a powerful pressure swept out like a storm with Han Xiao at the center, shaking the Secret Tree King’s mind! Boom!

Countless machines surged out from the Godly Stronghold and instantly condensed on Han Xiao’s body. They combined into a gigantic Mechanical Divine Body, which was the Supreme Heavenly Venerate. Transcendent Grade’s energy fluctuations erupted without restraint!

The face of the Secret Tree King instantly changed, and the ferocity on his face turned into fear and disbelief. “This is the level of the Tree God ?”

He was not mentally prepared at all.

At this moment, all tactics and plans were thrown to the back of his mind.

The Secret Tree King did not hesitate to construct a transportation door and escape. He was no longer arrogant and only panic remained in his mind.

However, Han Xiao was faster than him. With a flash, his gigantic body teleported behind the Secret Tree King and tore the roots of the World Tree apart. Then, the Emperor Skysplitter Blade slashed down and invisible psionic energy waves exploded like a blade wave.

Crack!

The sound of a mirror shattering could be heard. Within the range of the psionic wave, the space barrier, various forbidden spells, transportation door, and everything else that was constructed by magic power rapidly collapsed like a sandcastle!

There was not the slightest bit of resistance!

“What?!”

The Ancestral Tree King, who had just teleported behind Han Xiao and was about to launch a sneak attack, froze on the spot. His expression changed drastically!
