Chapter 1405 Hila’s New Form

Without waiting for the Subduing Tree King to make a move, Hila had already attacked. A red light flashed in her eyes, and the death energy that had formed into an ocean shot out. It contained an aura of destruction, sealing all of the Tree King’s dodging angles. Suppressing the shock in his heart, the Subduing Tree King flashed with green light, and his powerful Pugilist flames burst out like a supernova. A thick green light wave burst out and the approaching death energy froze in midair and shattered one after another. However, more death energy surged down and filled up the gap almost instantly.

After being strengthened by the power of the undead, the corrosion was many times stronger. Although the Subduing Tree King’s protective flames blocked the death energy, there was still a portion of the death energy that stuck on it, constantly wearing down the thickness of the pugilist flames. The pugilist flames quickly lost their vitality, turning into stars before disappearing into the universe.

“This ability has the attacking properties of impact, erosion, decrease in activity, spirit, and so on. Furthermore, it seems to have some sort of superimposed killing technique. If my body is hit, it won’t be good...”

With a thought in his mind, the Subduing Tree King channeled more energy into his protective shield. He also used his authority as a Tree King to summon the World Tree Root. It spun rapidly like a tornado, shattering the incoming death energy.

Without stopping, he bent his knees and stomped hard. A shockwave exploded behind him, and he shot out like a cannonball, turning him into a stream of light as he charged straight towards Hila.

“Come!”

Hila’s eyes turned fierce, and a wave of red-black energy suddenly surged out from her body before quickly rolling back, covering her body, layer by layer. In an instant, it became solid and the death energy seemed to have solidified, turning her into a five to six-meter-tall red-black giant. At the same time, dense and complicated silver-gray lines covered the little giant’s body, looking rather mysterious.

The outline of the giant’s body was exactly the same as Hila’s, but there were no facial features on its face, only a pair of eyes burning with white light.

The next moment, the green meteor slammed into the abdomen of the little giant and flew out with her. Like a red and green ray, it penetrated dozens of starships, leaving a path filled with fireworks.

Dong dong dong

Green fist shadows descended from the sky and landed on the giant like a storm. However, her red and black body was extremely tough, and there were no signs of it being shattered.

Suddenly, the multitude of fist shadows disappeared. Everyone saw that the giant had caught the Subduing Tree King’s fist with both of its hands.

Bang!

The powerful force created a flowing ripple on the surface of the giant’s body, spreading from his palm to his back, and then out from his body. A green energy shockwave spread out in the universe behind it, shattering hundreds of battleships.

“A Pugilist is invincible in close combat? I don’t believe it!”

With a strong will to fight, the red and black giant suddenly smashed its head on the top of the Subduing Tree King’s head, shaking the two of them. With a loud clank, the iron-headed baby received a ‘friendly greeting’.

Immediately after, the giant let go of the Tree King and clenched his fist. In the blink of an eye, countless red flashes appeared, and hundreds of fist imprints burning with red flames appeared on the Tree King’s protective shield. A huge force burst out and instantly sent him flying.

In this form, Hila had actually managed to defeat the Subduing Tree King in close combat! “..... Interesting.”

The Subduing Tree King that was sent flying immediately stopped and rubbed his head. The rest of his body was unharmed, and he was surprised by Hila’s close combat skills.

After the previous fight, he realized that this giant’s physique was extremely tough and strong. If not for the lack of Pugilist flames, he would have thought that he was fighting a peak Beyond Grade A Pugilist.

“Again!”

Hila waved her hands, full of fighting spirit. Although her ability was good at attacking from mid to long distances, she still preferred engaging in fierce close combat.

After so many years of persistence in challenging Black Star, being pressed down on the ground time and time again, Hila had already gotten the thrill of being tortured. Not only did she like to get beaten up, but she also liked to beat others up just like Black Star did. In the past ten years, Aurora had suffered quite a few punches from her.

Because the Power Of The Dead contained the ability inheritance of her previous owner, Nerkese, Hila did not need to focus on developing her abilities to understand the usage of many Esper Abilities. After stepping into the peak Beyond Grade A realm, she had unlocked many new abilities, and transforming into a red and black giant was one of them.

Hila’s control of death energy was usually focused on the outside of her body. Now that she could condense and compress it in her body, she could transform herself into another form, called ‘Reaper Liberation’. This was one of the main battle methods of Nerkese.

This skill had many transformation stages, and the further one went, the stronger they became. However, each stronger stage required a sufficiently high energy level to unlock. The final requirement for unlocking the ultimate stage, ‘God of the Dead’ required an Energy Rank of more than 90,000 Ona. Hila had yet to meet the requirement, and she had only unlocked the ‘Departed Soul’ stage. It was the miniature red and black giant that she had currently transformed into.

After entering the ‘Reaper Liberation’ state, her body and the Underworld Dimension would fuse to a higher level, and she would be able to activate a new talent. The more Hero Spirits there were in the Underworld as well as the higher their quality, the more enhancements to her strength she would receive. The effect was similar to the [Proof of Leadership), which was also one of the reasons for Hila’s huge increase in combat strength.

At the same time, because the body after transformation was made up of highly condensed death energy, the characteristics of the original ability still existed. Even if physical attacks were used, they would still have the ability to cause Death’s Erosion, damaging and corroding the soul. Furthermore, just touching her body would cause the life force of an outsider to be lost.

The two of them looked at each other in midair, and the next moment, both of them moved at the same time. The red and green figures clashed once again, and their fists landed on flesh. The aftershock of their fists shot out and disrupted the battlefield.

“Tsk tsk, so scary.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Han Xiao stayed in the base, clicking his tongue as he watched the battle.

He had experienced this form of Hila before and her close combat ability was indeed very strong. Combined with her recovery ability, she was extremely tanky, and her combat strength stood firmly in the first tier.

However, in his eyes, even with this move, Hila was still far from being able to defeat the battle form of the Tree King. Before he advanced, even if he could win against the Subduing Tree King alone, he would not be able to do anything to him in a short period of time. Hila’s strength was far weaker than before he advanced, so it was impossible for her to defeat the Tree King alone.

However, with her disgusting tankiness, she would not be beaten into a meat patty even by the Subduing Tree King anytime soon.

Han Xiao no longer looked at the two of them and looked at the other battlefields.

The Fortitude Tree King and Herberlon were old enemies, and their eyes were filled with hatred. The two Mechanical Deities’ huge bodies rolled across the battlefield and shattered starships. Other than the two of them, there were also quite a few Mechanical Deities on the battlefield. Due to the size of their bodies, they were all the most conspicuous people within the Beyond Grade A battlefield. As for Milizaus, after successfully “losing weight”, he had already escaped the fate of being a target. At this time, he was chasing after a World Tree Army leader and throwing magic spells. His improvement was huge, fully showing the benefits of getting to know an ancestor.

The rest, such as Manison, Kasuyi, and the others, found their opponents and fought non-stop. Furthermore, golden light would shoot out from the battlefield from time to time. That was Aurora healing people with precision. Her control was much more skillful than ten years ago, and her success rate was higher. It could be seen that the special training was quite effective.

After a few rounds of Sanctums’ resuscitation, the three Universal Civilizations had a lot more experts in the first tier. However, the ten executives of the World Tree, the high-level Holy Tree Emissary, the thirteen ancestral spirits, and the army commanders were not to be trifled with. However, not all of the first-tier experts had entered the battlefield. The World Tree did not allow all the experts to participate in this probing attack, and the three Universal Civilizations had also hidden a batch of Revivors and new Beyond Grade As. Although the three Universal Civilizations had a disadvantage in terms of numbers, their strength had increased, so they did not suffer any losses and were temporarily in a stalemate.

“Feidin is going to attack, right?”

Han Xiao looked at Feidin, who was hiding in the fleet, and narrowed his eyes. Although the souls of all the enemies were bound to the World Tree, causing the Soul Swapper to only be able to destroy them and not transfer the souls out, it was still very powerful.

As expected, after watching for a while, Feidin finally took out the Soul Swapper and activated this Universal Treasure.

The next moment, the souls of the crew members within the surrounding World Tree Spaceships were torn into pieces, and they died on the spot.

Tens of thousands of World Tree battleships faced such a situation, and the damage was still spreading further. “Hmm? What’s going on?”

The Subduing Tree King’s expression changed, as he sensed this abnormality from the Mind Sharing. The strange thing about the Soul Swapper was that it did not leave a trace. In the eyes of the Subduing Tree King, large batches of the World Tree crew had died without any warning. They could not find the source of the attack, but it was definitely the enemy’s doing.

Although they did not know what special weapons the enemy had used, it was not a coincidence that the sudden deaths were gathered in one area. The World Tree fleet immediately began to adjust and avoid this area.

Although this was a stupid method, it was indeed effective. The Soul Swapper did not have an unlimited range. Although it could cover the entire planet, under the scale of the galactic battlefield, this range was relatively small. Of course, Feidin was not a fixed cannon. As long as he swam around the battlefield, he would be able to kill more enemies.

The Subduing Tree King naturally did not know about this. After observing the sudden death of the soldiers, he then looked at the current battle between Beyond Grade As, with a heavy mood.

“It’s about time to retreat.”

Although Black Star, who was the most difficult to deal with, had yet to appear, the Tree King had already decided to retreat.

He had thought that this probing attack would allow him to gain the upper hand in terms of individual strength and did not expect the situation to turn so bad. This civilization that was viewed as prey was extremely tenacious. It seemed like even if he managed to land on their territory, he would not be able to defeat them easily.

This time, he was not the main attacker. If the situation was good, the Subduing Tree King would not mind sacrificing himself. However, the current situation was not as he had expected. He felt that there was no need to continue fighting.

The Tree King’s eyes narrowed, and his energy exploded. His fist glowed with the green light in the shape of a cross, and with lightning speed, it slammed into Hila’s abdomen.

Bang!

A halo of impact appeared!

The two of them were originally locked in a fierce battle, but this heavy punch suddenly broke the stalemate, and Hila was sent flying. At the same time, the World Tree Root beside the Subduing Tree King threw Hila further away, smashing a row of starships like a meteor.

The Subduing Tree King did not chase after her. Instead, he turned around and retreated. The other World Tree experts received the order and retreated simultaneously, leaving only the Lord’s Avatar of the Fortitude Tree King and the other Mechanic experts behind.

Although he was now unable to kill Hila, the difference in strength between them was not so easy to bridge. If he wanted to leave, Hila would not be able to stop him.

“Chase!”

Kasuyi shouted in the mental network, and the people still on the battlefield chased after him.

Hila finally managed to stop herself, and when she looked up, she realized that the Subduing Tree King was already far away. She immediately chased after him, but the distance between them was increasing instead of decreasing

She could not help but release her mental waves to shout:

“Don’t run! Keep fighting!”

The Subduing Tree King turned a deaf ear to her words and ignored her completely. He shuttled back and forth between the battles among the two fleets, getting closer and closer to his own formation, leaving her with only his back view.

At this moment, Dillon, who had already materialized, suddenly appeared on the battlefield. He looked at the figure of the Tree King from afar and sneered.

“Are you kidding me? How can you call yourself a King like this? You’re just a piece of trash that ran away. You don’t even deserve to be the most useless Pugilist.”

As soon as he finished speaking...

The Subduing Tree King momentum suddenly decreased, and a look of shock appeared on his face.

What’s going on... It’s just a simple taunt. With my personality, I actually stopped for no reason and wanted to beat this guy up?! Could this be some kind of mental control similar to that of the Voice Spirits?!
