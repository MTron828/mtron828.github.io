Chapter 1391 Meeting and Promotion

Looking at the stunned expressions on everyone’s faces, Han Xiao knew that practicality was the most important thing. He released the pressure of his life level, and a solid aura gushed out. The air in the room seemed to have turned into a sticky gel, making it difficult for people to move.

A crushing pressure suddenly crashed into the hearts of the Beyond Grade As. Their expressions changed, and they instinctively became nervous. Their nerves tensed up, and the cells in their bodies began to pump out energy like wild cats facing their enemies.

Right at that moment, the pressure disappeared like a receding tide.

Only then did everyone come back to their senses. They could no longer sit still. “Black Star, how did you do it ?” Someone was extremely shocked.

“Quick, quick, tell us how to break through to the Transcendent Grade!” Someone could not wait.

“Who would have thought... who would have thought that there would really be a higher level? I thought that Beyond Grade A was the limit of individual strength...” someone mumbled.

The majority of the Beyond Grade As were in an uproar. This situation looked no different from when the Calamity Grade students pestered Feidin when he advanced to the Beyond Grade A realm.

Han Xiao waved his hand and casually said, “The failure rate of the Promotion is very high. I was just lucky.”

Hearing this, Secret Master wisely chose to shut his mouth, not daring to refute.

To everyone, Black Star’s Promotion was too sudden, and it was difficult for them to digest. Other than a few people who knew about it, most Beyond Grade As could not contain their panic and shock.

Throughout history, generations of geniuses had never been able to break through the limits of individual strength. Many people even thought that Beyond Grade A was the limit of individual strength. They did not expect Black Star to not only break through it but do it at such a young age.

Although they knew that Black Star was the most accomplished Super in history, the significance behind breaking this publicly recognized limit was completely different.

At this moment, in the eyes of everyone, Han Xiao was like a shining guide, a pioneer. His image had once again enlarged.

“You...” Manison hesitated. Black Star had opened a new level without showing himself, which made him feel very complicated.

Originally, although Black Star was powerful, they were still at the same level. Although Manison was much more benevolent now, he still had some unwillingness to admit defeat. If there was a chance, he would still chase after the competition.

But now, the gap between the two of them had completely widened.

Manison was watching how Black Star caught up to him step by step and left him far behind. Even now, he could not even see Black Star’s back. Even with his firm heart, he could not help but feel disappointed.

This time, Kant spoke.

“Black Star, you don’t have to be humble. If not for you, this limit would still be an insurmountable obstacle in the eyes of the entire Beyond Grade A group.”

His tone was filled with envy but also excitement.

The other Beyond Grade As were the same. Of course, some were envious and jealous, and many felt bitter. However, most of them still thought that they had a huge reliance now!

If an unfamiliar and neutral Beyond Grade A had reached the new level, they would be so envious that they would want to replace him. However, if this Pioneer was Black Star, they could accept it and be happy.

On one hand, Black Star’s reputation among the Beyond Grade As had already reached an unprecedented level. On the other hand, he was the leader of the association and had obtained so many benefits for the Beyond Grade As. He had long become one of them.

Due to Black Star’s methods and the temptation of the Sanctum, the Beyond Grade As had already formed a close community of interests. The stronger the leader, the more important their Beyond Grade A group would be in the universe.

Furthermore, Black Star was the source of the Sanctum Revival. The stronger he was, the more guarantee their revivals would have, so it was naturally worth everyone’s happiness. Furthermore, many Beyond Grade As believed that Black Star, as the leader of the association, would more or less impart them with some experience of breaking through. No matter how they thought about it, there was nothing to lose.

After understanding all the details, most of the Beyond Grade As present became even more excited. They looked at Han Xiao with even more admiration.

Not only did Black Star bring the Sanctum Revival, but he also pointed out the direction of individual strength. Everyone felt that his leadership position had never been as legitimate as it was now. Han Xiao looked at everyone’s excited, respectful, and admiring expressions and smiled.

“It’s fine as long as only we know about this. Don’t spread it around. By the way, the upper echelons of the three Universal Civilizations already know about it, so don’t worry about them... As for the advancement method that everyone is concerned about, I just happened to succeed. I still need to familiarize myself with the power of the new grade. When I have a stable method of advancement, I’ll share it with you. Forget it for now.” Beyoni’s eyes lit up. “Will you tell us all for free?”

“...Guess?” Han Xiao glanced at him as though he was looking at a lifelong daydreamer.

“I guess not.” Beyoni smiled.

“You’re smart.”

Han Xiao rolled his eyes.

Hearing this, the Beyond Grade As present did not have any objections. The method to advance to the Transcendent Grade was so precious that even they would not easily reveal it, had it been them who had advanced.

Kasuyi, who was at the side, felt that Wuornos had already grasped the method to advance, so keeping this secret to the association did not seem to be of much use. However, he would not jump out to object.

With his current trust in Han Xiao, he felt that Han Xiao’s every action had a deeper meaning.

This time, Beiger could not help but ask out of curiosity, “I wonder if we can take a look at the strength of a Transcendent...”

Before he could finish, Han Xiao interrupted him.

“The war is not over yet. You will see it sooner or later. I won’t show it now.”

Hearing this, everyone could only nod.

Han Xiao looked around and saw that someone still wanted to speak. He immediately said, “Everyone, today is just to announce this matter and let everyone understand the situation. The meeting will end here. Everyone, please leave. I still have some things to arrange.”

Everyone was stunned. They originally had a belly full of questions to ask, but seeing that Han Xiao did not seem to want to answer, they could only swallow these questions.

The Beyond Grade As tactfully stood up and left the conference room with excitement that had yet to dissipate.

Now that they were no longer Supers of the same level, they subconsciously became more obedient to Han Xiao’s orders. Han Xiao watched as the Beyond Grade As left one after another, but there were still some who did not leave. Hila and the other army officers surrounded him with shock.

They had not received any conclusive news before this, so they were just as surprised as the others.

“Come, let’s have a few rounds. Let me experience the higher level of strength.” Hila went straight to the point. “Go away. I’m not in the mood to abuse you today.”

Han Xiao pushed her aside.

Feidin ignored this and sincerely congratulated, “Congratulations.”

After saying that, he could not help but sigh. He had originally thought that he had slightly caught up to Black Star after advancing to the Beyond Grade A realm, but in just a brief moment, the gap was greatly pulled apart.

Han Xiao smiled and nodded. He did not say anything and only patted his shoulder.

This time, Ames walked up and smiled. “What do you plan to do next?”.

“Plan? The same as before, continue to prepare for war,” Han Xiao replied. He suddenly thought of something and said while rubbing his chin, “But in terms of private matters, I do want to reproduce.” Ames raised her brows. “With who?”

“Are you willing?”

Ames hesitated for a moment before shaking her head.

“Then I can only think of another way.” Han Xiao spread out his hands with a tinge of regret.

“What are you going to do?” Ames narrowed her eyes.

“Let me see if I can use my cells to cultivate some test-tube babies through gene modification.” Han Xiao turned to look at Aurora, who was a little confused, and said thoughtfully, “Also, if I use my blood and bones to fuse with her life energy, I should be able to mass-produce offspring.” “...Up to you then.” Ames regained her composure, shook her head, and laughed. “Your idea of reproducing is really like a Mechanic.”

“What do you mean ‘like a’? I am a Mechanic.” Han Xiao did not care. “Industrialization is the way to go.”

War was imminent, and it would be too late for him to give birth one by one. He needed a batch of high-quality Supers who had inherited his Racial Talents, so there was no point in having too few.

To obtain a large enough descendant race, the usual method was to turn into a breeding pig and mate with the opposite sex of the native race. Only males could do this. However, Han Xiao was not interested in this. He was simply going to use the Mechanic method to mass-produce offspring. He did not need to capture the females of other races like the Beast Ancestor. He could reproduce without any gender and be self-sufficient.

Although the offspring raised with this method were more standardized, it was worth a try. After all, it was kind of a waste of resources to have such great Racial Talents but not make use of them. Anyway, he did not lack money or manpower, so raising an entire race was not a problem.

Han Xiao did not mention this matter anymore. He turned to look at Hila and said, “Don’t return to Soul Terminal during this time. I am bringing you to do something.”

“What?” Hila was curious. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Kill EsGod,” Han Xiao said.

Hila’s eyes flashed, and she immediately understood what he meant. She narrowed her eyes and said, “EsGod is a very powerful combatant. If he enters the Underworld, he should immediately become the strongest among the Hero Spirits. Furthermore, without the restriction of the genetic chain, he might be even stronger than when he was alive!”

“That’s right.” Han Xiao nodded.

He had never underestimated EsGod. Even among the peak Beyond Grade As, EsGod, who was in his complete form, was an extremely powerful individual. What Han Xiao paid the most attention to was EsGod’s Esper Ability[Esper Silence]!

This was the nemesis of almost all Espers. Back then, he had used this Character Summon Card to cause EsGod to fail miserably.

Now that the war with the World Tree was blazing, he felt that it was time to let this trump card see the light of day again.

Feidin blinked and said with doubt, “Strange, the dynasty should not be willing to see the Underworld continue to grow. They actually agreed to this request?” Han Xiao smiled and shrugged.

“That’s because I gave them an irresistible reason.”

Beep beep beep...

His communicator rang.

Han Xiao paused and took out his communicator. Suddenly, his eyes sparkled.

The few of them had been paying attention to his expression, and they could not help but lean their heads over to take a look.

“What happened? Why are you so happy?” Aurora was curious.

Han Xiao put away his communicator and laughed.

“My luck has changed in the past few days. I didn’t expect double happiness. The army is going to have a new Deputy Army Commander!”

Everyone’s spirits were lifted. “Hadavy, Jotina, or Lagi?” Feidin guessed. “None of them.” Han Xiao smiled and shook his head. “This guy’s name is Evans. Let’s go and meet him.”

Hearing this, everyone was shocked and looked at each other.

Evans? Among the Beyond Grade A seeds that joined later, there did not seem to be such a character. They did not know him. Could it be that he was secretly trained by the Army Commander ?

On the other side, on a desolate planet in the territory of the Black Star Army.

Streams of light flashed past and Han Xiao, Feidin, and the others had already arrived outside the atmosphere. They immediately discovered the source of the energy fluctuations on the planet. It was a Calamity Grade Super undergoing the final transformation to the Beyond Grade A realm. They had all experienced this stage before, so they were naturally familiar with it.

Han Xiao adjusted his vision and looked through the vortex-like energy. He could clearly see Evans, who was at the center, and he could not help but smile with satisfaction.

First, Feidin became a Beyond Grade A, followed closely by Evans. Thinking about it, the time it took for Evans to become a Super was not as long as Feidin’s, which meant that he had reached Beyond Grade A in an even shorter time.

The ‘Second EsGod Cultivation Plan’ that he had set up decades ago was now more than half complete. There was only one step left.

“I originally wanted to deal with Gaud after some time, but since Evans has already entered the Beyond Grade A realm, I can solve the problem with EsGod together.”

Han Xiao’s eyes sparkled.

Ancient Star Desert, Holy Accord Organization.

“What? Black Star has opened up a new level of strength ?”

Oathkeeper was stunned.

As an important partner, he was not an outsider. Under Han Xiao’s approval, Beiger had already sent the message to the Holy Accord.

Compared to the shock and excitement of the Holy Accord Beyond Grade As, Oathkeeper’s vision turned black.

F*ck, I’ve completely become someone else’s underling now. There’s no hope of turning the tables!
