Chapter 453: The Real Owner

Han Xiao’s lips curled up. Before notifying Chen Xing, he had purchased a type of specially made mind poison on another planet and coated it on the statues. As long as anyone’s Psychic powers came into contact with the poison, they would be damaged and suffer decreased Psychological Resistance. It was effective for Psychic type Espers, Mages, and Psychics.

Not only was Chen Xing already injured by Han Xiao, but he also absorbed all the energy from the statues, which made his mind weak, and now he was poisoned too. With all these factors, his resistance was largely decreased. Hence, his mind directly fell apart.

Chen Xing was Grade B, but Psychics were normally like paper, so Han Xiao did not dare to use Flaming Will. He was afraid that if he got lucky, or maybe unlucky, he would kill Chen Xing right away.

Blood poured out from Chen Xing’s nose and mouth to the floor, Chen Xing had lost the ability to resist. He looked at Han Xiao with a death stare, his face was filled with loath.

For an instant, Chen Xing’s expression seemed to become very calm, but that was so brief that it felt like an illusion.

“Why are you doing this?” Chen Xing clenched his teeth. “Did you accept a request to assassinate me?”

Han Xiao answered Chen Xing by grabbing onto his hair and slamming it heavily onto the floor, knocking him unconscious.

Explaining is a job for the villains. We are just!

“Old Herlous, come back here and let’s retreat!”

“Thanks to you, I might be quite busy at the moment...” Herlous’ annoyed voice came from outside the door. He had blocked several waves of guards outside, so the fight outside the door was getting intense.

Han Xiao grabbed Chen Xing’s clothes and threw him to the Volga brothers, then he aimed his hands at the hotel wall and launched a maximum output Void Jet Spray.

Boom!

The gray shockwave blasted through the wall. Bricks and rebars showered onto the ground, and the air became filled with the pungent smell of dust. A huge hole appeared on the outside wall of the hotel. The ground was hundreds of meters below, and about a hundred meters below them was the nonstop traffic of hovering cars.

Han Xiao caught an opportunity and jumped down, smashing through a hovering car’s roof and landing on the seat. The driver was horrified, but before he could speak, Han Xiao knocked him out and threw him onto the backseat.

Han Xiao quickly sat on the driving seat and held onto the steering wheel. He immediately felt a sense of familiarity. The next moment, the car flew upward and deviated from the midair traffic track, stopping outside the hole in the hotel’s wall.

“All of you, come in!” Han Xiao said as the door opened.

The people squeezed in. Before Herlous could enter, the blaring alarm became even louder. Han Xiao looked in the rearview mirror and saw a convoy of hovering police cars coming from behind.

This was a high-class hotel, so there were a large number of police patrols nearby. The commotion had already raised alarms, and the hotel had informed them of the situation.

Han Xiao did not dare to continue waiting. He controlled the car to drive away and yelled, “Jump! Quickly!”

Herlous slashed sideways with the back of his sword and swept all the guards away, then he hastily turned around and sprinted to the hole on the wall. With a step that cracked the floor, he crossed almost a hundred meters in the air like a leap of faith and fell right into the car from the hole that Han Xiao smashed through earlier.

“Close, that was close...”

Herlous had yet to recover from the intense fight earlier. Suddenly, he felt he was sitting on something very soft. He looked down, and it turned out that he was sitting on a stranger’s face. He asked in a surprised tone, “Who’s this?”

“A driver that kindly gave us his car... Hey! Don’t sit on his face, be appreciative.”

Seeing that everyone was here, Han Xiao sped up immediately and charged forward like an unruly rhinoceros.

Not only were there police hovering cars behind chasing them, but there were more in front as well. However, as they were in the air, forward and backward were not the only two directions, so there was no way that they could stop him from escaping.

The turbulence made the people in the car feel like they were sitting inside a sardine tin that was being violently shaken. Herlous wanted to question Han Xiao about why he was doing this, but he had no choice but to put that thought away for the time being—he was afraid he might throw up if he opened his mouth.

Aroshia turned into her energy form and instantly felt better.

Sylvia, who had fainted from the Psychic wave earlier, slowly woke up. The world before her eyes was spinning wildly, making her think that she had a concussion. In less than thirty seconds after she woke up, she felt nauseous and vomited, fainting once again.

“Stop your car immediately, or we will open fire!” An announcement was made from the speakers on one of the police hovering cars.

Han Xiao grabbed the steering wheel. His car crashed directly and accurately into that police car’s tail. The police car spun rapidly in the air like a gyroscope, and waves of shouting came out of the speakers.

Han Xiao felt zero pressure when facing such an amateur force. He downloaded the map of the entire city from the mechanical suit database, and the artificial intelligence assistant quickly planned a route and showed it on the analysis screen.

After more than ten minutes, he quickly got rid of all the pursuers. The tattered hovering car stopped at the gap between two buildings.

...

Bleurgh!

Herlous held onto the car window and vomited for a while before he finally felt better. He breathed heavily, stared at Han Xiao, and said with a fiery tone, “My dear captain, do you now have the time to explain what is going on to us laborers?”

He was very frustrated. How did a normal reward collection process turn into them being chased by the police all over the city? Furthermore, they had kidnapped a galactic celebrity.

If it was a woman, it would be fine, but it’s a man! What are you trying to do, captain!

Han Xiao changed his position and looked at the backseat. He pointed at Chen Xing’s head covered in dry blood and said, “My target is this guy. He’s not as simple as he looks.”

“... Thanks for your reminder. I didn’t know a Grade B Psychic is not simple!” Herlous clenched his teeth.

With worry written all over his face, the youngest Volga said, “He’s a huge celebrity. We will definitely be wanted by the local police, and we might even be reported to the New Phylen Alliance’s direct police department. This will damage our mercenary name. Furthermore, the Rain Star System is New Phylen Alliance’s territory. What should we do?”

“Don’t worry.” Han Xiao looked at Chen Xing and said, “That guy will speak for us, and as long as he does, we’ll be fine.”

“Are you going to threaten him? I don’t think that will work.” Herlous expressed his doubts.

“Threaten? No, there’s no need for that.” Han Xiao smiled. “He will choose to help us.”

As he was speaking, he pulled Chen Xing out of the pile of people and threw him into the passenger’s seat. After some pondering, he took out some tissue and wiped the blood off Chen Xing’s face.

Chen Xing’s face was covered in bruises and swollen parts. His delicate looks during his performance were nowhere to be found.

“I used too much strength earlier. Sigh, he was quite a handsome boy. What a pity...”

Han Xiao sighed sympathetically.

Pa pa pa!

Since his face was already in that state, Han Xiao gave him a series of slaps as a wake-up service.

Chen Xing’s eyelashes shook, and he slowly opened his eyes. His pupils gradually focused, and he sat up straight.

His temperament changed completely. If he was more like an alluring woman earlier, he was now completely like a masculine man. He turned to look at Han Xiao and smiled calmly; there was no sign of him being furious like earlier.

“Hello, I have been looking at you since just now. Although you might have attacked me to kidnap me, I would still like to thank you for giving me the chance to come out and breathe some fresh air.”

Completely unlike his earlier feminine tone, his voice was gentle and deep. It was almost like he was a different person. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Yo—you...” Herlous was bewildered.

‘Chen Xing’ nodded and smiled gently.

“Nice to meet you, my name is Adrian Kelvinsin Feidin. You can call me Feidin. You don’t have to be surprised—I’m the real owner of this body. The Chen Xing that you met is... how do I put it... I would say she is a not-so-friendly guest.”
