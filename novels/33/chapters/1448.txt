Chapter 1449 We Are People Who Have Experienced Tumultuous Times

Supers Holy Land, in a certain lifeless sector.

A ball of colorful energy floated in space, its shape changing unpredictably, like a cloud being kneaded by an invisible force. All kinds of high-energy particles flowed through it, like electrical signals being released during neuron activity. The entire energy ball was like a small nebula-shaped energy field brain.

Evans floated in the middle with a serious expression, carefully controlling all kinds of energy to perfect this nebula brain.

However, all of a sudden, the energy nebula started to expand uncontrollably, and the neural bridge that was built from all kinds of energy collapsed.

Just as the energy nebula was about to explode, Evans’ Esper Ability Domain opened up. The violent energy suddenly stabilized and quickly shrank, turning into a dazzling light sphere the size of a human head before being absorbed into Evans’ body.

“Sigh, I failed again...”

Evans sighed in helplessness.

Ever since he witnessed the battle between Transcendent Grade Supers, he had always felt that his strength was insufficient. He had been driven ever since to pursue that unbelievable power.

Originally, after the war ended, everyone had started to take a break, but Evans was one of the few people who did not relax and had been busy developing his Esper Abilities.

On one hand, his motivation was his own pursuit, and on the other hand, Evans still remembered Black Star’s high hopes for him. He was not willing to waste his hard-earned potential and wanted to reach Black Star’s level.

On the other hand, EsGod was very glad about this. He thought that Evans was keeping his promise to help him beat Black Star up and always taught him things to guide Evans in his cultivation.

“I hope to increase my strength as soon as possible. His Excellency Black Star told me that he hopes I will be the main pillar of the Supers Holy Land in the future. I cannot disappoint him...”

Evans clenched his fists and encouraged himself.

Just as he was about to give it another try, he suddenly sensed something and looked in a direction.

The stream of light approached, and a spaceship arrived in hyperdrive, hovering not far away. A burly figure flew out. It was Karlot. “Eh, so it’s you. I was wondering why there was another high-energy reaction zone in our territory.”

Karlot was surprised to see Evans and took the initiative to talk to him. “Er, hello.” Evans hesitated for a moment before nodding

Although the two of them were both members of the Black Star Army, they did not interact much with each other. They only knew each other’s basic situation and could only be considered as colleagues.

“What are you doing here?” Evans was curious.

“I was looking for an extreme environment to temper my body. The spaceship sensed a high-energy reaction, so I came over. So, you were training. No wonder.”

“Oh, I see...”

The two of them were not familiar with each other, so they bit the bullet and chatted for a while. When they realized that there was nothing to talk about, they gradually fell silent.

However, neither of them left. The atmosphere slowly became strange.

When the two of them were in seclusion, they had always thought that they were the only seeded players who had received special treatment from Black Star. However, after leaving the mountain, they were surprised to find out that they were not the only ones. Such a relationship made the two of them have strange thoughts about each other. On one hand, they were curious about the other party’s background, and on the other hand, they were curious about what Black Star saw in the other party... This mentality was akin to two top students in a class receiving special treatment from their teacher, and they subconsciously felt competitive...

After a long time, Karlot coughed and broke the silence.

“How about... We spar?”

“...Sounds good.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Evans and Karlot’s eyes met in midair, and sparks seemed to fly.

Black Star Army headquarters, Fleet Commander’s Office.

Herlous sat on the sofa with his legs crossed. He looked at the Sunilian in front of him and pushed the wine glass on the table.

“Drink some?”

“No need, Your Excellency Herlous.”

Herlous did not mind. He sized up the Sunilian and nodded.

“You must be the Sunil leader of this generation. Not bad, not bad. The previous leader mentioned you to me before. He said you’re very smart and capable.”

“You flatter me.” The leader nodded.

The Sunilians were Herlous’ race. Ever since the rise of the Black Star Army, Herlous, as the earliest elder, had a lot of authority, and he provided many resources to the race.

Therefore, every generation of Sunil leaders would come to visit him. This generation was no different.

“Since you’ve become the leader, do your best.”

Herlous encouraged and looked at the young Sunilians behind him. He raised his brows.

“These are...”

“Your Excellency Herlous, these are a few young men with potential among my immediate family. They wish to enter the Black Star Army to train. Please take care of them,” the Sunil leader said respectfully.

Herlous sized up the few of them, and the youths immediately stuck out their chests and raised their heads nervously.

Seeing this, Herlous shook his head and said, “The army has changed its leader, and Nero is now in charge. However, the standards are still as strict as ever. I can make them official members, but whether they can climb up will depend on their own abilities.”

“Thank you, Your Excellency.” The Sunil leader bowed. Herlous waved his hand, indicating that there was no need for formalities. After a pause, he suddenly changed the topic. “From now on, leaders of your generation should stop visiting me. You should be more independent. You should leave me out from now.”

The Sunil leader’s body trembled slightly, and his expression was complicated. However, he did not say anything, lowered his head, and left with his men.

After the group left, another person walked in. It was Sylvia. She had been eavesdropping outside for quite some time. “Not bad. You’ve finally decided not to use your position for personal gain,” Sylvia teased.

“Nonsense. I’ve always been thinking about the army.” Herlous rolled his eyes.

“I was just joking. However, I’m very curious. Why aren’t you helping the race anymore?” Sylvia blinked.

“They can’t always rely on me, or else they will become dependent sooner or later. After close to a hundred years, the habits that have been cultivated from generation to generation have already started to show signs of this. I can’t just ignore it.” Herlous shook his head and said with a deep voice, “Furthermore... Black Star was able to tolerate me in the past, but now that the authority has changed hands, I have to be sensible in the future.”

Sylvia curled her lips and did not speak. She stood in front of the window with her hands behind her back and looked at the bright galaxy outside. Suddenly, she sighed and muttered,

“In the blink of an eye, it’s been a hundred years...”

Herlous also turned to look out the window and sighed. “That’s right, it’s been a hundred years... We actually followed Black Star to this point. Sometimes, it feels like a dream. If Black Star had not invited me back then, I might have spent the rest of my life in my own little pub.”

“If I hadn’t met him...” Sylvia’s tone paused, and she shook her head. “Maybe I would have died in some corner of the universe long ago. The life we have now is not something we can hope for...”

The two of them looked out of the window quietly and did not speak anymore. They quietly savored their memories.

In this peaceful era, time passed even more silently. In the blink of an eye, another few months passed.

On this day, in the conference room of the three Universal Civilizations.

“Recently, the direct Beyond Grade As have been restless. The expansion of the Beyond Grade As is too shocking.” “Thankfully, Clotti, Oulou, and the others have stabilized the situation. Otherwise, the direct line of descent might have turned to the Supers Holy Land.” The leaders of the three Universal Civilizations sighed.

The Supers Holy Land had broken the old structure. As the original beneficiaries of Supers, they naturally could not feel comfortable, but they could only silently endure the waves of impact.

“Speaking of which, Black Star did not appear during this period of time. Hasn’t he already completed the Sanctum Revival? What has he been busy with recently?” The Pope was curious.

“Who knows? Anyway, I can’t get any information.” Marbruce was helpless.

“It’s not a good idea for him to disappear for so long. If the Star Alliance sends in a new infiltrator, and Black Star happens to not be around, we might get exposed.” “Speaking of which, if Black Star is willing to help, as long as he controls the leader of the Star Alliance, we will be able to win easily. It’s a pity that he doesn’t want to help.”

“Heh, with Black Star’s personality, there’s no such thing as an absolute deal. I think the price is not enough. As long as some conditions are made, he should still agree.”

“That makes sense, but he has a huge appetite now. We have to think of a way to convince him...”

Just as the three of them were discussing how to pull Han Xiao to help with the Star Alliance a remote projection suddenly appeared in the room. It was Han Xiao. The three of them were shocked. “Black Star? You... you’re back. Why didn’t you inform me...” Marbruce was halfway through his sentence when he suddenly realized something. He frowned and said with dissatisfaction,” Hey! Did you hack into the Dynasty’s database again?”.

Han Xiao ignored Marbruce’s dissatisfaction and looked at the three of them with a strange gaze.

“I’m here to share the information of the Sanctum. We can develop it together. If you’re not happy, I’ll leave.”

The three of them were stunned.

“Are you serious? Are you really taking us to develop the Sanctum?”

Louis’ tone was filled with doubt and disbelief. He had thought that Black Star was joking.

Han Xiao nodded but suddenly changed the topic.

“But before we work together, I have something to tell you... Don’t be afraid of what I’m about to say...”

“Afraid?”

The Pope found it funny and did not think much of it.

“We’ve even experienced an enemy like the World Tree. What else can we be afraid of? Just tell us. We’ve seen all kinds of storms. We won’t be scared.”

Han Xiao raised his brows with a playful expression.
