Chapter 1409 Special Sense, Birth of a Pivotal Snake nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

While the three tree kings were discussing, they suddenly paused at the same time and fell silent. They all sensed a message from the mother tree’s consciousness.

A strange light flashed across the Ancestral Tree King’s eyes as he slowly said,

“Mother tree sensed that another natural enemy has appeared and told us to kill it.”

“Is it that strange creature again? It’s actually not extinct.” The Secret Tree King was a little interested.

The Ancestral Tree Dynasty nodded. “Hmm, the secondary dimension is suitable for you. Go and lead our kindred to resolve this matter. Try to find its location before the natural enemy enters adulthood.”

“I’ll try my best.” The Secret Tree King did not comment further.

This was not the first time the World Tree had discovered a natural enemy. In the early years of the civilization, there were records of natural enemies invading.

The restraining relationship between the two sides came from the abnormal entanglement at the information state level. There was a two-way connection, so the World Tree Civilization had always paid attention to the existence of natural enemies.

The World Tree’s ability to sense its natural enemy was divided into two phases. When the natural enemy was in its infancy, the World Tree would only know of its existence and would not be able to sense its exact location. As the natural enemy gradually matured, the sense towards it would also become stronger. When any natural enemy entered adulthood, the World Tree would be able to track their location accurately to kill them, eliminating a large number of natural enemies.

However, the World Tree could only sense its natural enemy after it was born, and it could not discover the embryo that the natural enemy had given birth to. Therefore, it had never been able to kill all of them. In the end, there were still some that managed to slip through the net, so it could only settle for the next best thing — taking the initiative to kill the infants.

In fact, the World Tree had always been focused on expanding in the secondary dimension, and part of the reason was that it was dedicated to exterminating its natural enemy. Once it sensed something, it would immediately inform the Tree Kings to kill the younglings of its natural enemy as soon as possible and not allow its natural enemy to enter adulthood. This was a very high priority, and only the Tree Kings knew of the details.

The Fortitude Tree King could not help but ask, “What about the frontline war?”

“Let’s first eliminate the mother tree’s natural enemy. It seems like our operation will have to be postponed.” The Ancestral Tree King glanced at him, thought for a moment, and added, “Don’t forget to water the Subduing Tree King.”

Secondary Dimension World, expeditionary army outpost.

A huge ring-shaped teleportation gate was suspended in the dimensional space. This was the gate that the three Universal Civilizations used to enter and exit from the main universe. There were many secondary dimension fortresses around it, and groups of exploration teams came and went.

With a flash of light, Han Xiao’s figure appeared on the special transportation platform.

The person in charge of the outpost was already waiting there. He immediately came forward.

“Your Excellency Black Star, you’re finally here.”

“How’s the situation now?” Han Xiao looked at him and asked.

“That embryo’s absorption rate of dimension energy suddenly increased by a million times. I don’t know if it’s good or bad. You should go take a look yourself. I’ve already prepared the vehicle for you.” “Alright... By the way, how did the Realmless King react?”

“He went there a step earlier. He should be observing the changes in the embryo at a close distance.”

“Alright, I’ll go too.”

Han Xiao nodded.

After more than ten years of development, the secondary dimension that the Realmless King had lent out had already been modified by the three Universal Civilizations. Currently, the three Universal Civilizations were using this outpost as a springboard to greatly increase the expeditionary army’s strength. Furthermore, the three Universal Civilizations used their tradition of being hooligans to convince the Realmless King to take out more territories for them to build their bases. Currently, this area had already become a ‘shallow dimension’, where the three Universal Civilizations could enter and leave to and from the main universe directly.

Even if the Realmless King was unwilling to provoke the World Tree, he was now tied to the same war chariot by the three Universal Civilizations.

Han Xiao sat on the carrier, set the coordinates of the dimension, and started the engine. The heavy particle thruster spewed out raging flames and quickly turned into an invisible tail stream. The conventional engine transitioned to the dimensional shuttle engine, accelerated to the critical point, and disappeared from the spot, performing a hyperdrive jump. The shuttle entered a colorful tunnel. Not long after, the carrier suddenly shook, and the light outside the window disappeared, turning into a black secondary dimension space. They had arrived at their destination.

A grayish-white embryo floated in the middle of the dimension, guarded by a large number of mechanical troops.

The projection of the Realmless King was right beside him. When it sensed the vehicle entering, it could not help but turn around. When it realized that it was Han Xiao, it approached him.

“Black Star, you’re here too.”

“Tell me about the situation.” Han Xiao flew to his side.

“The energy of this dimension is flowing into the embryo at an extremely high speed. If this continues, it will collapse very soon. I feel that this embryo is about to be born...” the Realmless King explained.

Han Xiao nodded and looked at the embryo.

The gray fog under the membrane was originally very stable, but at this time, it was like boiling water, and it was fluctuating wildly. The long black shadows inside were becoming more and more distinct, attacking the membrane from the inside, causing bumps to appear on the embryo.

In Han Xiao’s senses, this embryo seemed to have turned into an energy black hole. The quality, space, and energy of this secondary dimension were all collapsing toward the embryo and being devoured. When some eggs were born, they would eat the eggshells to replenish their nutrition. In Han Xiao’s opinion, the second dimension where the Pivotal Snake Egg drained its energy from, like a parasite, was similar.

Not long after, the secondary dimension became riddled with holes. The remaining debris was quickly eaten up by the Pivotal Snake Egg, and the embryo was directly exposed in the space storm.

Han Xiao had already retracted his mechanical army. He did not interfere with the changes of the Pivotal Snake Egg and watched from the side with the Realmless King.

Chi!

The membrane suddenly split open, and the grayish-white fog inside leaked out, spreading outwards. The surrounding chaotic space stream could not penetrate this layer of fog.

Han Xiao pulled over a cloud of fog and analyzed it. He realized that the substance formed by this fog was a special biological particle that could isolate space storms and seemed to have the ability to shatter through space, allowing one to travel through dimensions. The membrane quickly shriveled, but the fog was still increasing, covering the appearance of the Pivotal Snake. Only a black shadow could be seen in the gray fog, like a dragon hiding in the clouds.

Right at this moment, the Pivotal Snake suddenly flew in the opposite direction of the two of them.

“Is he trying to escape?”

Han Xiao’s eyes sparkled, and with a wave of his hand, the space device locked onto the Pivotal Snake, preventing it from moving. He slowly approached and flew into the gray fog. The interface immediately indicated that he had received continuous attacks. The surrounding gray fog was actively repelling outsiders, but the damage was too low and could not break through his defense. He did not lose any health at all.

Entering the center of the gray fog, Han Xiao finally saw the true appearance of the Pivotal Snake...

This was an enormous dark gold snake-shaped creature. It did not have an outer carapace, and its entire body was gleaming with a metallic luster. Its skin was constantly releasing more gray fog. This seemed to be something that was automatically generated by it, so it should be an external protective layer. It had two pairs of enormous membranous wings on its back and a pair of sharp claws on its abdomen. Its head looked like a snake’s head, but it did not have a mouth or nose, only a pair of cold golden vertical pupils.

Compared to the Space Louse, the Pivotal Snake looked much more beautiful.

“Although it’s called a snake, it looks more like a dragon...” Han Xiao thought to himself. He took out his psychic communication device and tried to communicate with the Pivotal Snake.

Han Xiao could feel the Pivotal Snake’s cold and aloof emotions, but it did not respond to his probing. ‘Eh, newborn animals treat the first creature they meet as their parents. Isn’t this how they act...

Even if it’s not like this, with my charisma and affinity, this little animal shouldn’t be so cold to me...’

Han Xiao was curious and tried a few more times. However, the Pivotal Snake only stared at him with its cold golden eyes and did not reply. It was as though it was extremely wary of the outside world.

Seeing this, he stopped communicating and directly poked the Pivotal Snake.

The next moment, the other party’s attributes popped up on the interface. Han Xiao quickly browsed through and was stunned. In the Pivotal Snake’s stats window, there was a talent ability that could sense the World Tree’s main body. However, it was currently in a gray frozen state, and the ability introduction stated that it would only be activated when it reached adulthood. At this time, the Pivotal Snake was still a hatchling.

“Such talent! As expected of the World Tree’s nemesis!”

Han Xiao was shocked and immediately became surprised.

This was a pleasant surprise. This meant that the three Universal Civilizations had a stable way of finding the World Tree’s main body. They no longer had to place all their hopes on luck!

Hmm, that doesn’t seem right. If not for Harrison, he wouldn’t have been able to touch the Realmless King, much less the Pivotal Snake Egg... In the end, it was all because of Harrison’s luck?!

“His Luck Glow is stronger than I thought...” Han Xiao was speechless, and his brain immediately started thinking.

He did not expect the Pivotal Snake to have such an ability, which meant that his plan could be changed. With such a trump card, the most important thing now was to nurture the Pivotal Snake infant and let it enter adulthood as soon as possible. This way, he could directly mess with the World Tree’s heart like a playboy.

“However, the expeditionary army cannot pause its actions. Who knows how long it will take for the Pivotal Snake to reach adulthood...”

Han Xiao made up his mind and continued trying to communicate with the Pivotal Snake. However, the Pivotal Snake hatchling still did not respond. It seemed like it would do whatever it wanted, and Han Xiao did not know what to do with it. After all, this was the first time he had come into contact with a Pivotal Snake. He wondered if all newborn Pivotal Snakes were like this.

He did not dare to deactivate his control over the Pivotal Snake hatchling either. Judging from how this thing ran away the moment it was born, it was most likely going to die if he let it go.

Han Xiao had no choice but to put the communication problem aside for the time being. He grabbed the Pivotal Snake and walked to the Realmless King’s side.

“It’s a very strange creature that’s very useful to me. It feeds on secondary dimensions. Since you’re called the Lord of a Million Dimensions, I’ll leave the feeding mission to you.”

The Realmless King’s face fell when he heard this.

Those secondary dimensions were all territories that he had collected. Lending them to the three Universal Civilizations was already very depressing, and now he even wanted to feed them to this creature? Do you really think I’m a dog that you can slaughter as you please?!

Seeing that he did not respond, Han Xiao raised his brows. “You’re not willing?”

“...I’m honored.” The Realmless King agreed to Han Xiao’s unreasonable request without hesitation.

Stop talking, I’m a coward.

“Don’t worry, I won’t let you feed them for nothing. The three Universal Civilizations will give you some main universe materials in exchange.”

Han Xiao smiled and comforted him.

Since the Realmless King liked to collect trash, the three Universal Civilizations would definitely not be stingy with this cost. After all, what they did not lack the most was trash.

After successfully persuading the Realmless King to be generous, Han Xiao turned to look at the Pivotal Snake hatchling again. His eyes sparkled, as though he had seen the light of hope.

The Pivot Snake lowered its head and looked at him. Its golden eyes flashed with a human-like look of rejection as if it was a prisoner facing a guard.

Sensing this emotion, Han Xiao narrowed his eyes.

“My first impression of it isn’t too good. Could it be that the Pivotal Snake loves freedom? It seems like raising this creature won’t be that easy.”
