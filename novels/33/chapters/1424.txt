Chapter 1425 Attack and Plan

Somewhere in the Sea of Star Spirits, a refugee planet had already been tightly bound by the roots of the World Tree. The soil, minerals, and forests all turned into streams of data, flowing into it. In the distance, the emergency refuge ship carrying the people of this planet was fleeing through the galaxy. A World Tree fleet was chasing after them, and the escort fleet of the Galactic Alliance Army was covering them as they escaped.

The two sides fought intensely, leaving traces of energy explosions everywhere they passed. The light reflected in the eyes of the fleeing citizens.

Ten figures with metallic luster dashed around in the escort fleet, firing psionic cannons and destroying spaceships one after another. They were the Machinery Apostles, and their master was in the main ship of the World Tree fleet. It was a Lord’s Avatar controlling the mechanical army from afar.

However, there was not a single Beyond Grade A in the escaping fleet. Thus, they could only use the battleship to block the advance of the mechanical apostles.

“The enemy has a Beyond Grade A Mechanic, and we urgently need high-level combatants to help!”

The commander of the escort fleet looked at the one-sided situation and had no choice but to order the fleet to retreat while asking for help in the military channel.

The World Tree ignored their losses to send out a large number of Beyond Grade As, and their total number of high-level combatants exceeded that of the three Universal Civilizations in an instant. The entire force was mobilized, causing the three Universal Civilizations to not have sufficient Beyond Grade As, and they were unable to stop any World Tree Super.

The fleet that was escorting the evacuation of the civilians did not have any high-level combatants. When they met the World Tree fleet that had a Beyond Grade A Mechanic commander, they were immediately beaten black and blue.

“Please continue to hold on for a while longer. We are sending out the available Beyond Grade As.” The military intelligence’s response immediately sounded in the channel.

The commander gritted his teeth and shouted loudly, ordering the fleet to continue attacking. However, the scale of their army was unable to change from quantitative to qualitative. The ten mechanical apostles led the army and devoured the starships like locusts.

Just as the number of casualties rose to a shocking number, a space on the battlefield opened up like a wave of ripples on water. Then, with a flash of light, a figure rushed out like a burning meteor and slammed into the nearest Mechanical Apostle, sending it flying.

“Reinforcements are here!”

The commander immediately looked at the Beyond Grade As who had come to reinforce them.

Upon seeing this person’s appearance, the joy on the commander’s face froze.

“Why is it you?!”

“Why do you sound so disappointed? I’m the only one who’s free now. If you don’t want to, I’m leaving!”

Kohler was furious.

What’s wrong with you, little brother? I came to support you, and you’re still looking down on me?!

“...I’ll leave the enemy’s Mechanic Super to you. My troops will support you from the side.” The commander smiled bitterly and could only express his cooperation. Kohler snorted and charged at the ten mechanical apostles.

The soldiers looked over with hope. However, within a few minutes, the imposing Kohler was crushed by the combined attacks of ten mechanical apostles.

The commander covered his face.

The internal rumors were not false. Kohler was indeed the weakest among the Beyond Grade As.

“I don’t want to despise you either, but you’re too much. I gave you a chance, but you can’t even take care of the apostles, let alone a real battle. I don’t even like to use you when playing Wayne Cards...” Kohler dodged a few psionic beams and managed to return a punch. He sent a mechanical apostle flying and shouted in the channel, “What are you waiting for? I’ve helped you stall the enemy. Continue asking for help!”

Your tactical role is only to stall...

The commander cursed silently.

Just as he was about to resume his call for reinforcements, a wormhole suddenly opened not far away.

A Mechanical Lifeform flew out from within. Heavy mechanical armor covered its body, and every part of its body was equipped with high-tech melee weapons. It was armed to the teeth, and there were two wing-shaped vector thrusters erected on its back like two chess pieces. It was one of the Black Star Mechanical Oracles who had received orders to reinforce the various battlefronts in the universe, Heaven-Suppressing Banner. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Black Star’s elite troops are here!” Kohler was overjoyed and quickly waved. “Allies! Switch!”

Electric arcs flashed across the Heaven-Suppressing Banner’s eyes, and his thrusters shot out streams of light. He instantly accelerated and rushed into the battle.

The ten Mechanical Apostles detected a strong energy reaction. Immediately, eight of them set off to meet the Heaven-Suppressing Banner, leaving only two to hold Kohler back.

A dense psionic cannon beam shot out, and the arm of the Heaven-Suppressing Banner turned into a heavy shield. It suddenly pushed forward, and a bright complicated energy circuit appeared on the shield. A thick psionic shield popped out, blocking the concentrated

fire.

Amidst the bombardment, the distance between the two sides rapidly shortened. A mechanical apostle popped out a few wrist blades and headed straight for the energy core of the Heaven-Suppressing Banner. However, the Heaven-Suppressing Banner only turned around lightly and avoided the attack. The moment it passed by, he swiped at his waist, and a mechanical axe immediately unfolded, slashing out like a thunderbolt. The blade light instantly flashed past the mechanical apostle’s body.

The next moment, the two halves of the Mechanical Apostle flew out due to inertia. The cut was smooth, and countless precise parts could be seen. The energy core that had been accurately cut in the center jumped slightly, and then exploded!

A huge explosion lit up behind the Heaven-Suppressing Banner, reflecting on its cold alloy shell.

The Heaven-Suppressing Banner was the master of close combat weapons among the Mechanical Oracles. All kinds of weapons appeared like magic, constantly changing and dealing with the Mechanical Apostles with ease. Not long after, it killed more than half of the Mechanical Apostles like cutting vegetables. It was completely different from the scene Kohler showed. Suddenly, the Heaven-Suppressing Banner stomped on the ground, and an energy shockwave exploded behind him. He turned into a shooting star and rushed toward the World Tree fleet.

The axe slashed out beams of light, cutting the World Tree spaceship in half. In just a few blinks of the eye, the Heaven-Suppressing Banner had already arrived in front of the main ship, and the huge axe surrounded by golden lightning hacked down. A thick bolt of golden lightning shot out from the axe, instantly shattering the shield of the main ship and melting through the armor. The entire ship exploded, and dazzling light spread out!

Two figures, one chasing and one escaping, rushed out of the explosion. The Lord’s Avatar of the Mechanic Army Head was running in front, and the Heaven-Suppressing Banner was chasing after it. After exchanging a few blows, the Heaven-Suppressing Banner cleaved the enemy’s head in half with a swing of the axe. Electric arcs exploded, and the power contained in the body disappeared instantly. The Lord’s Descent had already been destroyed by him, and he looked like he had taken the head of an enemy general. With the current strength of the Mechanical Oracle, ordinary Beyond Grade As were no match for it at all. Their strength was on a completely different level from the Mechanical Apostle stage, and it would not be a problem for them to hold their own in battles against Beyond Grade As.

The high-level combatants of the enemy were eliminated, and the escort fleet immediately stopped their retreat.

The Heaven-Suppressing Banner did not continue to help. It reached out to remove the head of the enemy’s Lord’s Avatar, before hanging it on its waist as a trophy. Just as he was about to open the wormhole and leave, Kohler flew over and gave him a thumbs up.

“Not bad. We’ve finally defeated this powerful opponent.”

“When did we join forces? Were you fighting just now?”

The Heaven-Suppressing Banner tilted its head in confusion.

“I helped you restrain two mechanical apostles. Without me, you would have been in danger.” Kohler patted his chest and said, “Black Star and I are good friends after all. Protecting his mechanical apostles is just a matter of convenience. You don’t have to thank me.”

While the Heaven-Suppressing Banner was still calculating the logic behind this sentence, Han Xiao’s annoyed voice sounded in the channel.

“Shut up. You’re really a noob.”

“Oh, so you’re here.” Kohler laughed without any shame. “I was just joking.”

“Hehe.” Han Xiao curled his lips. “Heaven-Suppressing Banner, ignore him. Continue your mission.”

The Heaven-Suppressing Banner tilted its head, before ignoring Kohler. It opened the wormhole and went to reinforce the other battlefronts according to Han Xiao’s orders.

Primeval Star River, Mechanical Race territory.

The endless World Tree army was attacking the Mechanical Race’s defense line, and the two fleets were already locked in battle.

On the main planet of the Mechanical Race, Manison and Nilfgadi’s Lord’s Avatar stood at the highest point and looked up at the sky.

The Mechanical Race troops behind him did not panic at all. Instead, they looked at the backs of the two generations of Mechanical Race leaders with fanaticism.

“The Mechanical Race is the first target of the World Tree. Do they think we’re easy to deal with? We’re not easy to bully.” Nilfgadi stood with his arms crossed.

“You don’t have the right to say that. All these years, the Mechanical Race was able to develop to its current state because of me. It has nothing to do with you,” Manison said calmly.

Nilfgadi snorted but did not retort. He slowly said, “I didn’t expect us to fight together under such circumstances.”

“I know you don’t like me, but don’t worry, this battle won’t take long.”

Manison raised his hands slightly.

Boom!

All the planets in the Mechanical Race territory started buzzing, as though countless things were about to break out of the ground.

“After accumulating for so long, let the world see the strength of the Mechanical Race.”

Manison’s eyes flashed, and his tone was cold.

“Listen to my command, leave no one alive!”

Boom!

A seemingly endless mechanical army flew out from the planets one after another, covering the sky and earth as they welcomed the World Tree fleet.

“It’s starting, it’s starting...”

Many hidden Star Alliance observers looked at the chaos in the various Star Fields and could not help but smile.

“The World Tree invaded in one night. Clearly, our intelligence has come in handy. Very good! Very good!”

The Observer Captain clenched his fists with a ferocious expression on his face, gleeful at having gotten his revenge.

This time, the result of using someone else to do the dirty work was very obvious. It successfully turned the stalemate into a chaotic battle. This was what the Star Alliance wanted to see. It would be best if both sides were heavily injured.

“This way, even if the three Universal Civilizations can fight the World Tree Civilization, it would be difficult to stop their territories from being devoured step by step. If this continues, the three Universal Civilizations would be defeated sooner or later. It might just take decades, or maybe centuries,” someone said excitedly.

The Observer Captain sneered.

“Heh, this is only the first wave. In my opinion, the three Universal Civilizations won’t be able to last that long. According to the deductions of the upper echelons, it’s very likely that the World Tree will use the information we leaked to fan the internal suspicions of the three Universal Civilizations and disintegrate their fighting spirit. From the start of the war until now, the morale and faith of the three Universal Civilizations have been supported by belief. When this momentum is gone, it will be their defeat.”

As he spoke, a look of longing appeared in his eyes, as if he could see the future of the galactic society. “The three Universal Civilizations have been high and mighty for too long. It’s time for them to taste the feeling of their homeland and their nation being destroyed! Just like us back then!”

On the other side, the Super Star Cluster Alliance.

The sudden full-scale invasion of the World Tree gave the Super Star Cluster Alliance a shock.

Although the Super Star Cluster Alliance had received some news from the three Universal Civilizations over the past few days, they had only asked them to strengthen their internal defenses. They did not mention anything about the inside story, so the Super Star Cluster Alliance did not know anything about the situation of the information being leaked.

The various Star Fields were attacked, and the Super Star Cluster Civilizations were naturally targeted as well. However, compared to the intense battles in the other Star Fields, the size of the World Tree fleet that invaded the Super Star Cluster Civilization was very small, as though it was just a formality.

The Super Star Cluster Civilization thought that the World Tree did not want to bite them in the first wave of attacks, they were glad.

At this moment, an important meeting was being held in the conference room.

“...Everyone, the three Universal Civilizations have lost their border line of defense, and the World Tree has completely invaded. Let’s put this aside for now. The current situation is developing in the direction we’re looking forward to. A once in a lifetime opportunity has appeared in front of us, and we definitely can’t miss it. I think we can consider officially starting the ‘Great Relocation’ plan.” The leader of the Star Arc Civilization said with a deep voice. Everyone was whispering and discussing, their faces filled with joy.

Everyone felt that it was very magical. They could only passively wait for the right time, hoping for the chaotic battle to break out, but they did not expect the opportunity to come so suddenly. It was like the Goddess of Luck was on their side.

“Seconded.”

“I agree.” Everyone voted one after another. They had been waiting for this opportunity for too long, and there were very few objections. Now that the World Tree had successfully invaded, it was tearing apart the flesh and blood of the explored universe every second. With the three Universal Civilizations having failed, they would only be devoured if they stayed here.

No one wanted to lose everything, so they decided to give up the territory that would fall sooner or later and leave as soon as possible to preserve their strength.

Seeing this, the leader of the Star Arc nodded, took a deep breath, and said, “It seems like everyone’s opinion is rather unified. Then it’s decided. Let the three Universal Civilizations and the World Tree drag it out for a while longer. After we officially enter a stalemate, we’ll start the plan immediately!”

As he spoke, he paused before continuing solemnly. “Everyone, once we take this path, there will be no turning back. For the future of our civilization, we can no longer live under someone else’s roof.”.

Everyone nodded slowly.

The experience of being bullied by the three Universal Civilizations over the years flashed through their minds, making them more determined.

However, just as the leader was about to give a speech to strengthen his resolve, a communication request from Han Xiao suddenly popped up on the virtual screen. “Black Star? He wants to see us at this time?”

The eyes of the upper echelons of the civilizations froze, and their nerves tightened.

As the saying went, they had a guilty conscience. Although their escape was a result of careful consideration, they were considered deserters in the war. Therefore, just seeing Han Xiao’s name made them feel an invisible pressure.

The leader raised his hand and gestured for everyone to calm down.

“Connect me to Black Star and hear what he has to say.”
