Chapter 525: Aurora

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“You heard her. Even if you are my friend, they may not show you any face.” Han Xiao shook his head. Aurora was a kindhearted girl and would naturally be willing to help, but the same could not be said for Hila. This lass had a cold character and did not like bothering about other people’s affairs. Furthermore, she was extremely protective of her sister and would probably stop her sister from agreeing.

Even though Hila owed him a favor, with her obstinate temper, she would not let her sister pay him back.

“That can’t be right. It isn’t too much to just get her to use her Esper abilities.” Herlous became anxious.

“There is a historical reason for this. Whenever her sister uses her Esper abilities, she has to exhaust her own life force. She once suffered from some miserable mishap before and thus is extremely sensitive to this matter.”

“You promised me.” Herlous refused to give up.

“Alright then, I shall ask for you.”

Han Xiao shook his head helplessly and walked forward to stop the two ladies.

The nose of the gigantic bear twitched. It could smell a familiar scent, and its green bean sized eyes were fixed on Han Xiao, unsure if Han Xiao was his former owner. Only when Han Xiao waved did the bear charge out excitedly and roll around in front of Han Xiao, revealing his belly for Han Xiao to rub.

“This bear has been brought up well by you.” Han Xiao stroked the bear’s chin, and the bear’s furry feeling was much better than Harmon’s.

In this past, this bear could still be called a baby bear. Now that it was a few meters tall, Han Xiao could not call it a baby anymore.

“That’s right, it grew up extremely quickly. Being by my side, my Esper abilities caused his life force to flourish.” Aurora smiled.

Stroking the bear’s chin, Han Xiao suddenly mused, “If that’s the case, its meat quality should be great.”

The bear that was rolling on the ground suddenly froze in place as its ears shot up, feeling that something was wrong.

“Why did you stop us?” Hila asked.

Han Xiao then dragged Herlous out and said, “This is Herlous, my comrade. In one of the battles, he was accidentally injured. If your eyes are sharp enough, you should be able to tell that he has a mechanical arm...”

Hila was completely speechless. “Have you been using the standard of a blind person to judge others’ eyesight?”

“I promised to treat his broken limbs and wish to ask Aurora for help.”

“Don’t even think about it.” Before Aurora could even reply, Hila rejected Han Xiao.

Han Xiao’s mouth began to twitch. “You should at least pretend to consider...”

“You understand my sister; she is only able to restore the injuries of others at the expense of her own life force. In this world, I will only allow my sister to save a single person... that person is you.”

Hila suddenly paused for a while before adding, “Don’t think that our relationship is extremely good. It is just that we owe you a favor. Apart from you, we will not save anyone.”

Aurora’s [Dawn of Life] gave her an incomparably exuberant life force, and her cells were capable of producing a special life force. The life force that Aurora had was just like a bucket of water, and healing a severe injury would only require a single drop.

However, it was still her ‘life force’ being exhausted... Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

While Aurora was currently healthy, Hila would never allow her to waste her life force in such a manner.

Before Han Xiao could reply, Aurora interrupted, “Sister, this is an extremely easy task for me, and I have always been the one being helped by others. I wish to do something for Black Star as well.”

“No,” Hila rejected flatly.

“Sister, you can’t always make my decisions for me,” Aurora said helplessly.

“Why aren’t you willing to listen to what I taught you? The kind will only be bullied in this world!” Hila said with exasperation. “That was the case just now, and this happened again now. When will you be able to grow up a little? As long as there is a first time, all the injured people will come and find you. Are you going to always exhaust your life force to help them‽”

Han Xiao immediately became displeased. Why did it feel like this lady was scolding him?

Han Xiao immediately got Phillip to view through the surveillance record and briefly explain to him about the previous commotion outside the Sanctuary. The daily activities of the Sanctuary were controlled by Bennett, and Han Xiao could not be bothered to interfere with such small affairs. He only wanted to know the reason behind the two sisters’ conflict.

In the past, both the sisters had been living in challenging conditions and could only rely on each other. Now that they had spent a couple of years living in peace and seeing each other every day, even if they were biological siblings, their characters could not be completely compatible. Thus, conflict was inevitable.

“Sis, why are you always exaggerating matters? I will naturally reject them when I don’t wish to help,” Aurora said. “Besides, Uncle Black Star helped us so much, and I want to repay him...”

“No means no!” Hila then glared at Han Xiao and growled, “You are our benefactor, and we will definitely repay this favor. However, I hope that you will not think about touching my sister.”

Han Xiao was speechless. These words of hers made it seem as though he had some unscrupulous motives. She was truly too overprotective.

Looking at the two quarreling sisters, Herlous looked at Han Xiao and said helplessly, “You were right. It is hopeless indeed.”

“Let’s go.”

Just when the two of them were about to leave, Aurora suddenly raised her voice and said with a solemn tone, “Sister, you will not be able to protect me forever, and I cannot be a little child who is forever protected. I sincerely request that you do not make my decisions for me.”

“No, your thinking is far too childish, and you don’t know how to protect yourself at all.” Hila refused to budge.

“Why do you always want to change me‽” Aurora was angered for the first time, and a golden light flashed in her eyes. “The kind of people I look down on the most are those who don’t need help but mock those who are willing to help others. Only someone who went through despair will understand how much you hope for help during times of hopelessness. I know this feeling extremely well. During the nights when I needed help the most, I prayed for someone to save me time and time again, but the needle pierced into my veins over and over again without anyone ever stretching out their hands to me. Do you understand such hopelessness‽”

Hila had a face full of guilt. It was her carelessness that had resulted in Aurora being captured by the Germinal Organization and going through so much suffering. However, she had not been able to provide much aid and had only been able to save her sister because of Han Xiao’s unexpected aid. Hila had always felt that she was a failure of a sister.

In the past, Aurora would never talk about the pain that she had gone through in front of her, and this was the first time that Aurora had blamed her. Hila was completely caught off guard and did not know how to respond.

“I know that you have a strong-minded personality, and to prevent you from facing pressure, I pretended to be extremely optimistic whenever I met you,” Aurora said. “However, how happy do you think I could have been?

“I suffered inexplicable pain, and I know how cruel and violent humans can be. I know the despair of being in a hopeless situation without anyone to help you. The only thing I can do is fight and not submit to the darkness. I refuse to have my personality contorted by the pain and be filled with hatred. Believe me, this is far more difficult than bearing with the physical pain that I had to go through.

“Han Xiao helped me during my moments of hopelessness, and thus, I am willing to help others.”

She then looked Hila in the eye and said softly, “We cannot live in the past forever, and we all have to grow. Sister, I love you, but I cannot be your toy doll. I have my own thoughts and wish to become the kind of person I want to be.”

Hila opened her mouth and did not know what to say.

Han Xiao raised his brows and was a little surprised. He had not expected the two sisters to actually end up quarreling. It seemed like the two sisters had built up plenty of frustrations over the past few years when he was not around.

Even if they had gone through plenty of things together, it was impossible for them to always be so loving. When there were no enemies, they would definitely end up arguing because of their incompatible characters. This was something that Han Xiao had found from the couple living next door in his previous life.

However, having an argument might not be a bad thing. At least it would allow the two sisters to get to know each other better.

Han Xiao shook his head. Women...

Everyone fell silent, and Aurora rubbed her head embarrassedly. The atmosphere that she had taken so much effort to build instantly crumbled. She then asked carefully, “Sister, I am going to help treat him, okay?”

“You have already said so much, what else can I say? You can just take it that you don’t have this older sister. Go go,” Hila replied.

Aurora broke out into a smile and gave Hila a hug.

Upon seeing that, Han Xiao took the few of them to his machinery modification room. Taking off Herlous’ mechanical arm, Aurora pointed her palm at Herlous’ stump. A dense golden light shot out from her palms and entered Herlous’ body. The broken limb then began to grow out like a sprouting plant.

In the past few years, Aurora had also begun to develop her abilities, and she no longer needed to use her blood to save others. Instead, she was able to release the life force within her body.

By the side, Han Xiao and Hila stood together and watched the scene.

Suddenly, Hila asked with a complicated tone, “Do you think that I am wrong?”

“Hmm?”

Han Xiao turned around to look at her, only to see her biting her lips with her brow furrowed. She was obviously still frustrated over what had just happened.

“There isn’t a right or wrong; everyone is different. But if you want my opinion, I think that you make more sense. This world is very dangerous, and enemies are all around. The most rational thing to do is to put your own safety first.”

“You would actually agree with me...” Hila had a strange look on her face. Han Xiao had returned from the galaxy when the planet was in danger. With his ‘selfless’ character, she had thought that Han Xiao would support Aurora.

Han Xiao then shrugged and added, “But if you really ask me to make a choice, I would be more willing to be friends with a kind person.”

If not for Aurora’s insistence, his request would have been rejected by Hila. To him, he liked those who were more obedient.

Both the sisters were full of potential. A Grade S Esper ability was extremely rare, and if Hila was able to grow to the heights of her previous life, she would be able to crush a dozen ‘Herlous’s with a single finger. Furthermore, Aurora’s abilities were also extremely useful, and she was just like a walking HP potion.

As for their contrasting characters, Han Xiao did not mind it at all. As long as they were talents useful to him, all of that was no more than small details. Just like how Ames was extremely playful but there were not many who dared criticize her—strength was the most important.

...

Not too long later, Herlous’ arm had regrown. Give it a few test waves, he cried out with excitement, “Haha! My arm is back!”

Aurora wiped the sweat off her face and said with glee, “I’m glad I could help you.”

Rubbing Aurora’s head, Han Xiao gave her a series of praise before leaving with Herlous. Herlous was extremely satisfied with his new arm and skipped away happily.

Returning to his room, Han Xiao sent Herlous away before taking out his Galactic Communicator and turning to the local channel of the Garton Star System.

The plan to hire the players was already on track, and the skills to reach the next Energy Level had also been obtained. It was now time for him to see when Godora’s rescue squad would arrive.

Version 2.0 had been launched for half a month, and it was about time for Godora to arrive.

The Garton Star System was part of Godora’s administrative region, and with so many planets being plagued with calamity at the same time, it was truly too much of a coincidence. Godora would naturally have their suspicions, and the first party that they would think about would be their arch nemesis, DarkStar. Because they felt that this may be a trap, Godora did not make any rash moves and investigated the situation first.

Just a few hours ago, Han Xiao’s communicator had received a district message regarding this matter.

Many galactic media outlets had noticed the situation in Godora and had begun writing articles on it. As such, the calamity had attracted the attention of many, with the Godoran media being the most interested in the matter. After all, this was happening within the Godora region.

After a series of reports, more and more Godorans were informed of the calamity that their allied civilizations were facing, and they found out that their own civilization had not sent out any rescue troops. The voices of the citizens immediately sounded to push for their civilization to send aid.

After watching the local news of the Garton Star System, Han Xiao raised his brows and came to a conclusion.

“DarkStar has begun their plans...”

At this moment, Godora had not intervened in the matter, and news of the calamity would naturally be sent out by DarkStar in secret. Through some manipulation and stirring, this resulted in the entire event blowing up, causing Godora to become the center of everyone’s attention.

Apart from Han Xiao, the entire Star System thought that this was a sudden, unknown calamity, but no one knew that it was actually part of DarkStar’s plans.

“If my guess isn’t wrong, DarkStar’s forces should already be hidden on Planet Aquamarine.”

Han Xiao’s eyes glowed as he mused to himself.
