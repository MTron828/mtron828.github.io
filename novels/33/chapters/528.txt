“Have you heard about the news in the Garton Star System?” one of the fat Godorans said with a chuckle. He, Kedan, had an amiable look on his face. He had once been part of Godora’s Investigation Department but had been fired because of negligence. He had even stayed in jail for a good few years because of that. After leaving prison, he had migrated to Colony Planet Gautin and had stayed there ever since. The two others beside him were his friends.

“Of course, I’ve heard the news.” Another person shook his head. “The television is reporting how many low-grade civilizations in the Star System are suffering from a calamity.”

“It’s none of our business at all. Why are you mentioning this? Could it be that you are trying to steal a card while we are distracted?”

“Scram,” Kedan said with exasperation before whispering, “Do you still remember what I told you guys about?”

“Which matter?”

“The matter when I was still in the Investigation Department.”

“Che, you’ve bragged about that matter a few hundred times, and we are tired of hearing it.”

“Do you know, that planet is currently on the list of calamity planets?” Kedan chuckled. “I wonder how it has developed over the years. I want to go back and take a look. Do you guys want to come with me?”

“Are you sure? That planet isn’t safe now.”

“The older one becomes, the more one wants to look back at one’s past achievements.” Kedan chuckled. “Furthermore, I have a friend who stayed behind in that place, so he can receive us and be our guide. Besides, the rescue squad is there, and we can either pretend to be spectators or help with the disaster relief.”

As the two of them heard that, their tones became strange.

“That can’t be right? He’s still on that backward planet? Won’t he be bored to death?”

“Are you a fool? His hibernation chamber can be connected to the net, and I have always been in touch with him. He...”

Kedan rubbed his palms with excitement, but just when he was about to continue, the doorbell rang. The sudden ringing of the doorbell caused the three of them to jump up from their seats.

“Who would come at such a time?”

Kedan had a doubtful look on his face as he walked to the door and peered into the peephole. He did not know the few standing outside the door. They were all dressed in combat attire with a ring-shaped emblem on the center of their chest. Kedan felt as though he had definitely seen that emblem before somewhere.

Opening the small window at the top of the door, Kedan showed his face and asked warily, “Who are you guys looking for?”

The other party sized up him up before asking, “Are you Golden Mitland?”

Strange, why would these people know the IGN of my web account? Kedan immediately felt that something was wrong. After denying that he was Golden Mitland, he immediately tried to shut the window. At that moment, the person outside the door raised a laser rifle and pointed it right at Kedan’s head.

Kedan’s body froze in place, and he did not dare move the slightest bit. His legs began to tremble, and he thought that the other party wanted to rob him. Before he could even plead for mercy, he heard the next question from the other party, which sent shivers down his spine.

“Do you remember Angora?”

“I... I don’t know him....” Kedan’s eyes widened and his lips trembled. At that moment, the anxiousness that he felt was on a whole different level. It was as though this name had a frightening magic.

The person outside the door shook his head and said, “It’s okay even if you don’t know him. Follow me if you don’t want to suffer.”

“To... to where?”

“Black Star wants to see you.”

...

A couple of days later, the Sky Ring spaceship silently waited outside the atmosphere of Planet Aquamarine. Han Xiao piloted the BlackLight Stealth and went up to receive them.

There were only two other people in the control room, Hannes and Bennett, and this was their first time entering the universe in a spaceship. They watched the scenery on the outside in a daze as they enjoyed this novel experience. However, it was a mere few seconds from the surface to outside the atmosphere, and they reached the universe before they could even react.

Han Xiao had left the others waiting on the surface. He was only receiving the members of Sky Ring, so there was no need to make a big fuss out of it. Sky Ring had sent him some good news—they had managed to find Angora’s friend through the information that he had provided. This friend seemed to be called Kedan, and he appeared to know about Angora.

The two spaceships were aligned, and the hatch opened up. At that moment, the face of this Godoran was dripping with anxiety, and his eyes were filled with fear.

“Don’t be afraid, I only want you to give me some intelligence.” Han Xiao took out Angora’s portrait and asked, “You know him, right?”

Kedan felt waves in his heart and shook his head vigorously.

“I put him through a lie detector; he is lying,” the Sky Ring mercenaries interjected.

“Since you are so afraid, you are probably aware of what went on behind the scenes. Let me ask you directly. Are you related to the war on Planet Aquamarine?” Han Xiao raised his brows and knew that he might have caught the mastermind.

“No! I have never heard of Planet Aquamarine before! You guys caught the wrong person!” Kedan’s lips were sealed. However, none of them believed him.

Han Xiao took out a small metal plate that was about the size of a nail and stuck it onto Kedan’s neck. He then used his Mechanical Force to activate the metal plate, and Kedan’s body began to tremble violently. His eyes turned white, and his entire body shook. With his body contorting on the ground, he lost control of his bowels.

“Let me introduce this item to you.” Han Xiao pointed at the metal plate. “When this little cutie is activated, it unleashes a powerful voltage with a good kick. If you like this feeling, you should keep your mouth shut and slowly enjoy it.”

An electrical treatment was akin to torture, and the interface showed that Kedan was only an ordinary person, not a Super.

Kedan was like a fish out of water, with his body squirming around. A few minutes later, he finally broke down in tears and promised to share everything that he knew.

Everyone then helped Kedan up and placed him on a chair for him to calm down. At the same time, they put the lie detector apparatus on him. Kedan was still trembling, and he looked at Han Xiao with a guilty expression before narrating what he knew.

“I used to be a low ranked member of the Godora Investigation Department, and that was a few decades ago. At that time, Godora had just found Planet Aquamarine, and the usual practice for a low-grade civilization was to observe their progress. My job was to monitor the progress of this new civilization, give them an evaluation, and submit a report to the Foreign Affairs Department or War Bureau. This job was extremely easy but also very boring...”

“Get to the main point. What has the war in Planet Aquamarine got to do with you?” Hannes pressed.

Kedan began trembling as he said, “That... that was my doing. I made use of my job to send someone to Planet Aquamarine and got him to incite a war in secret...”

“It is indeed related to Godora!” Hannes flew into a rage, and Bennett jumped to his feet.

“Just what exactly did you do?” Han Xiao said with an odd tone.

Kedan then began narrating the process. In summary, he had pretended to be a guest from a high-grade civilization and contacted some nations privately. He had then made a few empty promises to them or emphasized on some theories. In any case, it had been extremely easy to get those backward aboriginals to listen to the words of an alien from a high-grade civilization. He had then fanned the flames in the background.

At that time, Planet Aquamarine had just found out about the presence of a high-grade civilization in the galaxy, and the state of the entire world had fallen into chaos. If nature had been allowed to take its course, there was a chance that the situation would have stabilized on its own, and the nations would have worked together to welcome a new era of peace. This was the most logical thing to do.

But at the critical moment, aliens had fanned the flames from behind the scenes to create conflict between the various nations and light up the flames of war. Even the nations that did not wish to go to war had also been dragged into the storm and could not remain neutral.

In the end, a world war had broken out on Planet Aquamarine, and only the Six Nations had been left behind. While the source of the war had been an exhaustion of resources, the critical factor had been the ’emissary of a high-grade civilization’ leading the nations into war.

Before this, Hannes had already made such a guess, and he felt as though his guess had just been verified. Both Bennett and Hannes were extremely furious. They had both been through the world war and could feel their bones turning cold.

The civilization that was currently helping Planet Aquamarine had been the mastermind that schemed against them previously. Why would a galactic civilization want to do such a thing? Did they want to swallow Planet Aquamarine, or did they wish to eliminate all enemies with potential‽

“What about Angora?” Han Xiao asked with a frown.

“He is a childhood friend of mine, and we studied in the same public school. It is just that my results were better, and I managed to get into a school of the Investigation Department. He left the mother planet, and I didn’t see him for a long period of time. However, our relationship was still extremely good, and I reached out to him to work together with me. I got him to pretend to be an emissary while I shielded him from my post.”

Just when Han Xiao wanted to nod his head, he realized that something was wrong. A cold glare flashed past his eyes and he said, “Why was Angora the one pretending to be an emissary? He’s only an ordinary citizen.”

He found a dubious point. If Godora was behind this matter, they would definitely have sent a professional. Why would they choose someone like Angora? Could it be that Angora had another identity?
