Chapter 1404 Confrontation

The intense battle between the World Tree Army and the Galactic Alliance Army lasted for two months, but the World Tree was still unable to break into the Flickering World territory. Although they had broken through the Galactic Alliance Army’s defenses several times, the defense circle that the three Universal Civilizations had used more than ten years to build, was far more complete than the temporary intercepting circle. The support network was extremely dense, like an extremely dense elastic net.

The deeper they sank, the stronger the rebound would be, and they would not be able to stand on their own. All the World Tree troops that had attacked the Flickering World were either beaten back or wiped out. Their best record did not even reach three days, not even passing through the Star System at the border.

The border battle reports of the Flickering World were constantly sent back to the Central Galaxy, spreading throughout the galactic society. Countless galactic residents had been in fear for more than ten years, and now that the enemies had truly invaded their territory, many of them were even more afraid. However, because the Galactic Alliance Army had always kept the enemies out of their territory, their outstanding performance gave some confidence to the galactic residents.

Siebert Fortress. Many Beyond Grade As were on standby here for two months.

“Heh, didn’t the World Tree like to use its individual strength against us? Why are they so cowardly now? They are getting rusty.”

In the lounge, Sun Hunter stepped on the table and said with disdain.

“Probably because they’re afraid of Black Star. He captured a tree king ten years ago, so it must have hurt them,” Kant smiled.

In the past two months, no matter how they provoked or enticed them, the World Tree did not send out their individual strengths to fight, calmly watching the Beyond Grade As of the three Universal Civilizations create trouble on the battlefield.

The Beyond Grade As were a little helpless. No matter how strong their fighting spirit was, there was nothing they could do if the others did not respond. They had even used their physical bodies to tempt the World Tree expert, but the World Tree experts still refused to come out.

“You’re thinking too much. The World Tree isn’t that afraid of me. They should be observing the number of individual strengths we have. They won’t give up on their Exchange tactic so easily. They’re probably going to attack soon.”

Han Xiao played with Ames’ hair and replied casually

He had been on standby with the others, waiting to catch a big fish.

In the past few days, the three Universal Civilizations had hidden the true size of their individual strength. Most of the new Beyond Grade As did not come out. Hila, Feidin, Evans, and the other powerful Beyond Grade As with special abilities or huge progress did not participate. At the same time, the Beyond Grade As who had ‘died’ during the last battle did not appear, allowing them to remain ‘dead’ in the eyes of the World Tree.

In the Holy Accord organization that was not yet revealed to others, there were still dozens of Revivors who were prepared to participate in the battle. The individual strengths displayed in front of the World Tree were just the tip of the iceberg. It was to make the World Tree think that the Exchange tactic was effective and fall into the trap.

After more than ten years of searching, Oathkeeper had accumulated quite a few Sanctum keys, but Han Xiao had never used them. He kept them as a strategic reserve.

Buzz

While everyone was chatting, the alarm suddenly sounded. The World Tree launched another attack on the outermost defense circle.

Everyone paused. Before they could move, a remote projection of an officer suddenly appeared in the room.

“Everyone, the Beyond Grade As of the World Tree have finally appeared. Please arrive at the battlefield as soon as possible.”

Hearing this, Han Xiao’s eyes sparkled. “It’s finally here... Is there any sign of the Tree King this time?”

“Yes!”

“Who?”

“Two. They are the Subduing Tree King and the Lord’s Avatar of the Fortitude Tree King.”

Kasuyi could not help but laugh and interrupted, “With the lesson from last time, the World Tree would not dare to let the Tree King go out alone. However, the arrangement this time is similar to the last. I’m afraid they feel that as long as they are careful, they will not fall for the same trick as the Heart Tree King.”

This time, a new Beyond Grade A asked curiously,

“The Tree King has already appeared. Does Your Excellency Black Star want to fight?”

“It’s only Subduing Tree King... Forget it, I’ll leave it to you guys.” Han Xiao stroked his chin, pondered, and clicked his tongue.

He hoped to catch a big fish. At the very least, it should be Fortitude Tree King. It would be best if it was the Ancestral Tree King. It did not seem worth it to expose his strength for a mere Subduing Tree King... He just disliked the Subduing Tree King, a Pugilist, because his abilities were too simple and he was not as important as the other Tree Kings.

Furthermore, there were plenty of Beyond Grade As in the Beyond Grade A Association, so there was no need for him to do anything. As long as they killed Subduing Tree King, he would not be able to revive in the short term. That should lure out the Ancestral Tree King and the Secret Tree King. They would be the better prey in Han Xiao’s eyes.

Hila’s eyes lit up, as though she was afraid that someone would snatch her opponent. “Leave this guy to me!”

Han Xiao raised his brows and dampened her enthusiasm mercilessly, “Although your improvement is not small, you are still far from killing a Tree King.”

“You won’t know till you try it.” Hila’s eyes flashed coldly.

“Alright, as long as you don’t let him escape.” Han Xiao curled his lips.

Originally, Wuornos was the most stable in dealing with the Tree King, but this guy had not left the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods for more than ten years, and he still had no intention of joining the battle. However, now that there was the eldest brother in the Underworld, they did not lack powerful experts.

Han Xiao noticed that Evans’ hands were trembling slightly, and he could not help but feel strange. “Are you afraid?”

“This is my first time on the battlefield, and it’s such a galactic war. I’m indeed a little afraid,” Evans said calmly.

Lagi mumbled, “What’s the use of being afraid? Could it be that I won’t die in battle if I am afraid? I didn’t expect to die so soon after becoming a Beyond Grade A for just a few years. Sigh, someone like me really doesn’t have the right to enjoy life...”

“Shut up.”

Han Xiao interrupted him.

If not for the fact that you have some combat power, I would have locked you in Amber today!

At this moment, on the border.

The enormous World Tree fleet was attacking the defensive perimeter, and the fleet of the Galactic Alliance Army cooperated with the various strongholds to counterattack. Countless terrifying rays of light shuttled back and forth in the vast battlefield of the universe, forming a bright but fatal rain of light that shot into each other’s formation, turning the spaceships into fireworks in space.

This was not the first time the two sides had fought, and the battle situation quickly heated up. The troops moved under the command of various military artificial intelligences. From a macro perspective, it looked like they were only shooting at each other on a large scale, but in fact, both sides were adjusting their tactics and carrying out minor operations.

On the battlefield, a group of Beyond Grade As of the World Tree were observing from afar under the protection of their starships.

The Subduing Tree King placed his hands behind his back and scanned the formation of the Galactic Alliance Army with his sharp eyes.

Not long after, the Beyond Grade As of the three Universal Civilizations also arrived on the battlefield one after another. The two sides faced each other from afar. Because only a portion of them had appeared, their numbers did not seem as large as the World Tree’s.

This batch of Beyond Grade As that had appeared was mainly those who had participated in the interception battle. The others were hiding in the dark and watching.

Seeing this, the Subduing Tree King narrowed his eyes and nodded.

“Humph, many of their experts died last time. They’re not our match this time.”

In the past two months, he had been observing the situation of the three Universal Civilizations’ Beyond Grade As. Most of them were old enemies. Although there were a few new faces, their numbers were limited. They were probably new Beyond Grade As.

He did not find this strange. The World Tree also had been nurturing Supers for more than ten years, and it had also given birth to some new Holy Tree Emissaries and ancestral spirits. The size of their individual strength had also increased.

A portion of the enemy’s individual strength had died in the battle more than ten years ago, and the dead of their World Tree had all been resurrected. The battle strength of both sides fluctuated, and the Subduing Tree King was Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

However, the Heart Tree King had already fallen. As a Pugilist, it was very difficult for him to instantly kill the enemy’s healer. He had tried it the last time, and he had fallen into Black Star’s trap. Thus, he did not plan to repeat the same mistake. The gathering of the World Tree’s powerhouses this time was just a test, and they did not have any intention of carrying out the Exchange tactic immediately.

Sweeping his gaze across the enemies, the Subduing Tree King suddenly realized that there was no trace of Black Star.

“That guy actually didn’t come out? No, he must have hidden himself to ambush us.”

The Subduing Tree King became alert.

The only person he was worried about was Black Star. The Heart Tree King had been sealed, and he did not want to follow in his footsteps. He was secretly on guard, afraid that Han Xiao would jump out and stab him.

As the saying goes, when enemies meet, their eyes will burn with hatred. The Beyond Grade As on both sides rushed toward each other without saying anything and immediately started fighting on the battlefield, forming a large area of chaos.

The Tree King activated his liberation mode, and his body glowed with green light. He had originally wanted to force Black Star out, but he did not expect to be stopped by a red-haired woman.

“Your opponent is me.”

Hila stood in front of the Subduing Tree King with a cold expression, her eyes filled with killing intent.

The Subduing Tree King’s eyes flickered. He had an impression of Hila.

“It’s you? Hmm, your self-healing ability is not bad, but you think you can stop me with your strength?”

Other than Black Star, the Subduing Tree King was not afraid of anyone. Thinking of Hila’s performance on the battlefield more than ten years ago, he did not even put her in his eyes. Hila did not have the habit of shooting her mouth off. Hearing this, she let out a cold snort, and a powerful aura burst out from her.

The Subduing Tree King suddenly felt threatened, and his expression changed. He looked at Hila with shock.

‘She has become so strong?’

Without a doubt, this red-haired woman had already stepped into the peak Beyond Grade A level, and her energy fluctuations were at the upper level of the peak Beyond Grade As. It had only been ten years since they last met, but she had already improved so much!

The Subduing Tree King’s expression turned grave. Although there was still a gap between the two of them, he had to admit that this woman in front of him was qualified to fight him.

He sensed the battle situation of his comrades and realized that the enemy Beyond Grade As were far stronger than the World Tree’s Beyond Grade As. Although they had lost in terms of numbers, they were not at a disadvantage. “How did they train ?” The Subduing Tree King was shocked. In just ten short years, they had made such an obvious improvement. How could Beyond Grade As increase their combat strength so easily? Could it be that the enemy’s territory was filled with geniuses ?
