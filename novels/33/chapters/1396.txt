Chapter 1397 Group Battle’s Godly Artifact and Request

The rankings were rearranged in the Underworld, and Evans temporarily stayed behind to receive EsGod’s guidance. Han Xiao then returned to the training base to train in seclusion. He used the new level of strength to upgrade all the machines under him and also studied some profound blueprints.

The dynasty was tricked, but they did not make a move. They endured and remained silent. Gaud’s whereabouts were also sealed. Han Xiao did not know how the dynasty planned to deal with Gaud. Maybe they were thinking of ways to restore his ability. Anyway, it was impossible for this guy to appear in the outside world for a while.

The storm caused by his advancement to the Transcendent Grade slowly subsided. After the initial shock, the three Universal Civilizations also accepted reality and returned to their normal state.

A few days later, in the Black Star Army’s private machinery factory.

Han Xiao stood in front of an experiment table and stared at a floating hourglass-shaped device. A dense amount of Mechanical Force was emitted from his body and connected to this device like a chain. The space on both ends of the device started to tremble.

“So, this is the principle behind psionic waves. Tsk tsk, this technology’s destructive power is not simple. It is indeed advanced technology. If combined with a Universal Treasure-level transmitter, it would be a large-scale strategic killing weapon. I’ve really picked up a treasure this time...”

Excitement flashed in Han Xiao’s eyes.

After these few days of research, he finally understood the psionic wave technology. In his eyes, this thing was an absolute godly weapon for group battles. Firstly, it would absorb energy from the outside world and automatically increase its attack range. If given enough time, it could even cover the entire galactic battlefield, but it was more controllable and would not spread endlessly.

Secondly, it was just as difficult to block and clean up as the Primordial Psionic Energy. In fact, because the psionic wave’s explosive form was like a shockwave instead of a solid energy mass like Primordial Psionic Energy, the speed at which it expanded was much faster and harder to block. Furthermore, it could ignore matter to a large extent, and its penetrative power was astonishing.

The third was that it could eliminate different forms of energy. Any type of energy could activate the transmitter, and the energy input was the type of energy targeted by psionic waves. It could be mixed multiple times. If dark energy was injected, psionic waves would eat dark energy and destroy the shields, physical devices, and energy cores that were formed or maintained by dark energy. At the same time, it would not affect other forms of energy. The reason why psionic waves destroyed all the electrical devices in the Arthur Civilization was that the researchers injected electricity.

In addition, no matter what kind of energy the psionic waves targeted, it would be extremely fatal. If a life form not strong enough was swept by the psionic waves, they would be reduced to ashes. The entire Arthur Civilization was wiped out by this.

“The fleets of the advanced civilizations are basically powered by dark energy and psionic energy. If I target these two types of energy, no matter how large the fleet is, it will be paralyzed. The number of troops will lose its meaning in front of this technology, and it will be enough to serve as the main battle weapon.” Han Xiao’s eyes sparkled.

The psionic wave technology was too powerful, just like an enhanced version of the omnipotent EMP. He did not plan to let others use it, or it would only end up threatening him. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Mechanics had many powerful weapons, but most of them were technologies owned by advanced civilizations. Therefore, most Mechanics did not seem to have any special killing methods, but psionic wave technology could be used as a trump card.

If this thing was installed on the Emperor Skysplitter Blade, Han Xiao believed that even without summoning his mechanical army, he would be able to fight the enemy fleet head-on in a one billion level galactic battlefield.

With one slash, millions of battleships would be paralyzed. How terrifying was that!

Han Xiao could not help but imagine this scene, and his mood instantly improved. Tyrsius was truly a great man. Not only did he provide the Beyonder’s Vestige to help him advance, but he also indirectly gave him such a powerful black technological weapon. What kind of generosity was this? It could move the whole Galaxy!

After a while, Han Xiao waved his hands, and the psionic wave transmitter in front of him disappeared. This was not a physical creation but a temporary product converted from (Virtual Creation (Pseudo)].

During this time, he had discovered a new method to use this ability for research.

Originally, Han Xiao only had an incomplete version of the psionic wave transmitter prototype that he had dug out from the Arthur Civilization. It was very difficult to reverse-engineer the technology. However, after dismantling the prototype and figuring out the rough structure and materials used, he used (Virtual Creation (Pseudo)] to create a temporary product and reverse-engineered the technology on the undamaged temporary product. This way, the efficiency was thousands of times higher than studying the prototype!

It was through this move that he was able to deduce and perfect the principles step by step, allowing him to understand all the tricks and reverse engineer the complete technology.

“Although this technology is powerful, it still needs to be tested. It’s not suitable for actual combat.” Han Xiao went through the information in his mind and nodded. Although the psionic wave mechanism was advanced technology, he still needed to look at its capacity and strength. Just because it was difficult to stop it did not mean that it was unresolvable. After all, it was not an unreasonable Space Wonder, and it could still be neutralized and countered. For example, even if the dark energy controlled by Clotti was targeted, it would at most be weakened and not directly disintegrated by psionic waves.

Therefore, in Han Xiao’s eyes, there was still room for improvement in the various parameters of this technology. He planned to strengthen it to the extreme and only use this trump card when the time was right. Han Xiao took a deep breath and moved his fingers. The experiment table floated away and returned to its original position.

With a wave of his hand, the fridge in the corner opened, and a bottle of iced beverage flew into his hand. He took a big gulp and relaxed slightly. He opened the forums to refresh his mood.

Currently, the battle at the frontlines was extremely intense, and eighty percent of the forums were filled with battle reports. Han Xiao quickly went through the posts one after another, and he suddenly noticed that a popular post had been pinned. It was Bun-Hit-Dog who had posted another new video.

He went in to take a look and saw that the post was being refreshed at a rate of a few hundred posts per second.

Han Xiao clicked on the video and realized that the duration of this episode was a little short. A lot of bullet comments quickly floated past.

“First!”

“It’s here!”

“That’s it? That’s way too short!”

“Can I free this video?”

“I just pooped, and the video ended.”

“Trash Bun-Hit-Dog, another average video. Hurry up and come out in female clothes to apologize for your mistake!” “There’s a saying, ‘Bun-Hit-Dog’s cross-dressing looks the best’. It makes me feel like the love between the elderly.”

“Thank you, brother, I’ve vomited. My stomach feels much better.”

Han Xiao looked at the comments and felt much happier. He then looked at the content of the video.

Bun-Hit-Dog made a series of dazzling video clips and said two pieces of news in a familiar video presentation style. One was that Black Star was suspected to have broken through the limit of Beyond Grade A, and he had secretly entered a higher level. The second was that Black Star was suspected to have kidnapped a direct descendant of the dynasty for reasons unknown.

These two pieces of news were very sensational. Bun-Hit-Dog did not waste any materials and added a lot of groundless rumors. It had a sense of déjà vu of ‘Approaching Science’ documentary film. There was even a short video of an interview with the dynasty officer who was the source of intelligence. He even thoughtfully gave the other party a mosaic. The video was not long, and it ended very quickly. Han Xiao scrolled through the replies and realized that many players were shocked by this, mainly because of the improvement in his strength.

“Has the Army Commander broken through the Beyond Grade A realm? Why isn’t there any news about it?”

“Could it be a secret?”

“Is there any warrior who wants to confirm the rumors with Black Star? We will pay our respects to you seven times.”

“I think it’s real. The Army Commander only used twenty to thirty years to become a Beyond Grade A Super. Now that he has stayed at this level for seventy to eighty years, it’s normal for him to break through another level.”

“A One look and I can tell that you have never studied the history of the development of the Supers in the Galaxy. Beyond Grade A and above Beyond Grade A are not the same concept. This is the first case. If it’s true, then it’s making history.”

“Speaking of which, the version this time is called the Age of Black Star. It’s actually referring to this. I definitely won’t be wrong this time!”

Although the players were shocked, Black Star had created too many miracles, and the players were already very resistant to it. The reactions had long changed from ‘he is actually so awesome’ to ‘he is still so awesome’.

Han Xiao did not pay too much attention to the reactions of the players. He was just a little surprised that Bun-Hit-Dog was able to obtain such news. The dynasty had locked down the news, and many large intelligence organizations did not know anything about it. It could only be said that Bun-Hit-Dog was indeed a player that poked into every nook and corner.

“Luckily, this news is only circulating among the players, and there’s no absolute evidence. It’s just some groundless speculation, so the impact is limited.”

Han Xiao shook his head. He did not want too many people to know about his Promotion for the time being, but he did not plan to seal or mask it. If the players knew of it, then so be it.

After scrolling through the forums for a while and looking at the army players’ bullshit, Han Xiao closed the interface with a smile and prepared to continue studying the technology. This time, Phillip suddenly appeared. “Master, hum, Risda wants to see you, hum!”

Han Xiao then remembered that he had this person under him.

“Oh, let him come over.”

After a while, a human-shaped light appeared in the room. Risda bowed and greeted Han Xiao.

“Your Excellency Black Star.”

“It’s been some time since we last met. As you know, I’ve been quite busy recently. How are your compatriots I saved last time?” Han Xiao asked.

“Thank you for your care. My compatriots have already given birth to many new members, and the AI civilization has been rebuilt. It has been recuperating for decades.”

“That’s good. What brings you here?”

“Your Excellency Black Star, although our civilization has been rebuilt, most of our compatriots are still controlled by the Mechanic Emperor and are in dire straits. You have a very high position now, so I would like to request your help again.” Hearing this, Han Xiao raised his eyebrows and remembered this mission that had been accumulating dust for many years. The requirement was to free the AI civilization members under Manison, and it was not completed yet. “This matter... Alright, it’s time to resolve it.”

Han Xiao thought about it and agreed. He felt a little bad about letting Risda wait for so many years. Risda’s compatriots had been transformed into Indestructible Mechanical Troops, and they were Manison’s trump cards. It was not easy for him to deal with this problem in the past, but now that he had become a Transcendent, he had a way to solve it.

In front of Risda, Han Xiao took out his communicator and called Manison.

After a while, the communication was connected, and Manison appeared on the virtual screen.

“...What’s the matter?”

Good lord, this d*mn guy doesn’t even bother greeting.

Han Xiao’s mouth twitched. “I want to make a deal with you.”

“Speak.”

Why is this aloofness back again? Are you the Transcendent or me?

Han Xiao thought to himself but did not bother to argue. He slowly said, “I want an exchange for the artificial intelligence civilization that you captured.” “You want me to release the Indestructible Mechanical Troops?”

Manison narrowed his eyes.

If someone else had made this request, he would not have bothered, but Han Xiao was different.

Manison thought for a while but did not reject it immediately. He nodded and said, “Then let’s exchange it for the method to advance to the Transcendent Grade.” “...Are you still asleep?”

“There’s no harm in trying.” Manison’s tone was calm. “Then what do you plan to exchange for it? This is my blood, sweat, and tears.”

“Don’t count on the complete Promotion method. However, I can tell you one of the conditions for the Promotion. Also, I will give you another group of artificial intelligence lives to transform into the Indestructible Mechanic Empire.” “Sure, deal. Also, you have to help me pay for the Indestructible Mechanic Emperor.”

Manison nodded.

“Have you been very poor recently?” Han Xiao curled his lips.

“In any case, I’m not as rich as you. I’m just an ordinary peak Beyond Grade A Mechanic. How can I compare to the first Transcendent Mechanic in history?” Manison’s lips curled up.

Han Xiao:”...”

Oh my god, Manison has learned to be sarcastic. My youth... oh, it has long ended.

After finalizing the details, Han Xiao put away the communicator, looked at Risda, and nodded.

“He has already agreed. I will go to the Mechanical Race and bring your compatriots back.”

“Our entire race will forever remember your kindness.”

Risda was extremely grateful. He sighed that his investment back then had been too accurate. It was only because of a look he took, but he had already accurately latched onto the thickest thigh in the galactic society.

The problem that had troubled him for many years was solved with just a few words. Risda felt that it was indeed the right decision to wait for Black Star to grow.

An hour later, in the Mechanical Race territory.

Han Xiao left a Throne in the nearby base and quickly teleported over to the Mechanical Race’s territory. Manison’s Lord’s Avatar was already waiting on the landing platform.

“I’m here. Where are your Indestructible Mechanical Troops?”

Han Xiao looked around but did not see the target.

Manison shook his head. “Give me what I want first.”

He still remembered that the last time they fought, Black Star’s Virtual Purification had awakened a large number of artificial intelligence lives, causing him to fail miserably. Therefore, he did not dare call out the troops at this time, afraid that Black Star would attack him directly and take away the target with force, making the deal invalid. He did not have the ability to find trouble with Black Star now, so he could only suffer.

Han Xiao thought about it and understood Manison’s concerns.

“Why are you so guarded against me? With our relationship, can I cheat you?” Manison almost said that Han Xiao had cheated him so many times, but he did not dare to say it. “Tsk, alright. I’ll give it to you first.” Han Xiao did not mind. After all, Manison did not dare go back on his word.

“Let me take a look at the artificial intelligence lifeform you prepared for me.” Manison was still worried. Han Xiao rolled his eyes. “Alright, summon some mechanical lives.”

“What for?”

“Heh, did you think I would kidnap an artificial intelligence civilization and give it to you? Of course, you’re the one who will provide the raw materials. I’ll transform them for you. This time, I’ll show you the methods of a Transcendent. I’ll treat it as giving you benefits.”

Manison opened the secondary dimensional army camp and pulled out a large number of mechanical lives. These were all members of the Machinery Civilization that he had created.

Seeing this, Han Xiao raised his hand. Mechanical Force flashed and instantly swept across all the mechanical lives present.

The next moment, the bodies of all the mechanical lives changed at the same time, becoming transparent and illusory.

Manison’s expression changed. He could clearly sense that the Mechanical Lives were undergoing a miraculous change, gradually turning from a Mechanical Body to an artificial intelligence lifeform. “What ability is this P” Manison was shocked.

Although he could do something similar, that was by extracting the artificial intelligence of a mechanical life and carrying out a series of complicated operations.

However, Black Star had directly transformed a solid mechanical life into artificial intelligence data. Only a Mechanic would know how unbelievable this was!

“Don’t look so shocked. I can directly change a life form into a virtual soul. They will be my bargaining chip.” Han Xiao smiled. “Is this a Transcendent technique...”

Manison muttered to himself, his heart burning

“Tell me, what is one of the conditions to advance?”

Hearing this, Han Xiao smiled. “Then remember, one of the conditions to become a Transcendent is... to use the Church’s National Treasure!”

Manison’s eyes flashed. At this moment, seventeen to eighteen plans to deal with the Arcane Church flashed through his mind, and he almost wanted to resume his old job as a sh*t stirrer.
