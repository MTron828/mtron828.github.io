Chapter 1407 Subduing Tree King: This Is All a Conspiracy, You Can’t Fool Me!

A battle between the two erupted.

Dozens of doppelgangers with different Esper Abilities worked together seamlessly. As soon as they clashed, EsGod suppressed the Subduing Tree King. The combination of various Esper Abilities and combo attacks was dazzling, and the Subduing Tree King could not find his bearings.

When EsGod had just summoned his doppelgangers, the attention of all the Beyond Grade As on both sides had been drawn over. Seeing how miserable the Subduing Tree King was, everyone could not help but have strange looks on their faces.

“What a strong Esper. With so many Beyond Grade A doppelgangers assisting him in battle, although the Subduing Tree King king has the advantage in terms of frontal explosive power, all his actions are disrupted by the large number of doppelgangers. He isn’t able to fight back at all and is completely passive...”

While wrestling with Herberlon, the Fortitude Tree King observed the battle situation on the Subduing Tree King’s side. The more he watched, the more fearful he became.

The Subduing Tree King was being held back by a large number of EsGod doppelgangers and could not take control of the situation. He was like a weak teenager who was forced into an alley by a group of strong men. He was getting further and further away from the main force.

This powerful enemy did not have the overwhelming strength as Black Star did, but the Fortitude Tree King felt that he was equally difficult to deal with. If a Super with only one ability faced such an opponent, and the strength of the two parties did not have an insurmountable gap, then the Super would be at a natural disadvantage. A Pugilist who only knew how to hammer people was an example.

‘Luckily, I’m a Mechanic...’

This thought appeared in the mind of the Fortitude Tree King.

On the other side, the Beyond Grade As of the three Universal Civilizations looked at EsGod with shock.

“EsGod is truly terrifying without any restraints. His true combat capability is so strong...”

Many people were shocked.

Most people knew EsGod’s name, and many had fought him personally. However, EsGod’s current combat strength was much stronger than they had imagined. He had never been this strong before. “Looks like the Underworld suits him very well.”

Manison’s eyes flickered, and his tone was complicated. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

EsGod had been imprisoned for close to a hundred years and wasted so many years. However, he was like a fish in water the moment he entered the Underworld. His stubbornness was gone, and his combat strength increased tremendously. While Manison had been training hard for so many years, due to Black Star’s persistent attacks, his combat strength had actually regressed and was not as good as when he was at his peak. As one fell and another rose, he realized that he did not have the confidence to deal with the current EsGod.

This comparison made Manison feel sad for himself.

Seeing the battle between the two of them, everyone quickly took action after being shocked. The World Tree experts tried to provide support, and the morale of the three Universal Civilizations was greatly boosted. They became even more obstructive and did not allow the enemy to leave the team battle to help.

For the time being, the two of them could not be bothered with the actions of their teammates and focused on the battle.

The green meteor crashed through the battlefield, but it was like a bug that had fallen into a spider’s web. All of its attacks were neutralized by EsGod’s doppelgangers using all kinds of strange defensive Esper Abilities. The Subduing Tree King could not break out of EsGod’s encirclement at all and could only be dragged along

The Subduing Tree King launched another series of close-range attacks, but the fists glowing with green light easily passed through EsGod’s body and did not hit anything.

Before he could do anything else, an EsGod doppelganger suddenly appeared from the side and floated over like smoke, turning into a curse and attaching itself to his body. His body suddenly became sore, and he could not even use half of his strength.

Before the Subduing Tree King could get rid of the negative status, the EsGod doppelgangers around him released different types of energy attacks.

Some shot out high-energy lasers from their eyes, some shot out ‘X’ shaped silver beams from their hands, some spun electromagnetic field lightning chains, and some pushed out dark red energy waves from their hands.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Multicolored energy bombarded the Subduing Tree King’s body. The light in the field expanded and exploded, causing the Subduing Tree King to tumble and fly backward.

Before he could fly far, the Subduing Tree King felt something tighten around his waist. It turned out that an EsGod’s doppelganger was already waiting for him on the way and had grabbed him by the waist.

His reaction was fast, and he used a powerful elbow strike to hit the EsGod doppelganger’s head. However, he did not manage to push the EsGod doppelganger back. The EsGod doppelganger’s head suddenly became blurry, as if there was a high-frequency vibration, and all the kinetic energy was absorbed.

The next moment, this EsGod doppelganger pushed his hip, and the kinetic energy rebounded, not missing anything and rushing into the Subduing Tree King’s body. “Get lost!”

The Tree King’s expression was twisted, his aura erupted and broke free from the control. He threw this EsGod doppelganger away.

However, before he could take any further action, more than ten mental attacks from different Esper Abilities suddenly exploded in his brain. Blood immediately spurted out from the Subduing Tree King’s mouth and nose, and his soul was injured. A large number of mental debuffs appeared, making him dizzy.

He endured the pain and was just about to use the World Tree Roots to help him out when he realized that the World Tree Roots were already pinned down by another group of EsGod doppelgangers using space, force field, and other Esper Abilities. “How many Esper Abilities do you have p” The Subduing Tree King was completely shocked.

After fighting for such a long time, this opponent had already used more than a hundred Esper Abilities. Attack, defense, control, evasion... All sorts of abilities were present, like a bottomless abyss. There was simply no limit!

Since the start of the battle, EsGod had never used any big moves to inflict heavy injuries on him. However, this method was like eating away at his life, continuously inflicting light injuries on him time and time again. It was extremely disgusting.

“I never counted.”

EsGod’s tone was calm as he continued to attack.

His Esper Abilities were endless and could be said to be omnipotent. He completely controlled the tempo of the battle and did not give the Subduing Tree King any time to catch his breath. The lethality was secondary, but the strongest aspect was the almost perfect chain of control, almost playing the Subduing Tree King in his palms.

While enduring the concentrated attacks, the Subduing Tree King observed the situation with difficulty. Seeing that the main force was getting further and further away, his heart could not help but turn cold.

“My teammates are being held back, and it will be very difficult for them to rush over to support me. If I continue to fight him like this, my condition will continue to deteriorate, and the chances of me being able to escape will become increasingly slim...”

The Subduing Tree King’s expression changed, and he suddenly had a flash of insight.

That’s right, Black Star has yet to appear. How can he not participate in the battle? He must be secretly waiting for me!

‘The Heart Tree King was tricked. Black Star knows that the other tree kings will be more vigilant, so he is hiding for the time being and pretending not to participate in the battle. He wants to make me lower my guard. When this Esper depletes my strength to a certain extent, he will suddenly attack and seal me as well!’

At this moment, the Subduing Tree King felt his mind clearing up.

That must be it. This is a trap! “That was close. If I am not decisive enough, I will fall for his trick... I can’t fall for his trick!’

He believed that he had seen through Black Star’s plan and made up his mind.

EsGod did not know anything about the Subduing Tree King’s mental state. Just as he was about to order his doppelgangers to launch another wave of attacks, a frightening energy was suddenly released from the Subduing Tree King’s body.

“Hmm? This feeling is...”

EsGod’s eyes narrowed, and he retreated without hesitation.

The Subduing Tree King had a fierce expression on his face, and his body suddenly emitted a bright light.

“I’d rather self-destruct than let you guys succeed!”

Bang!

His entire body exploded, and an intense energy shockwave spread out. The EsGod doppelgangers around were all sent flying, and the World Tree Roots turned into light fragments and disappeared.

The Subduing Tree King had always thought of himself as a rational Pugilist. His choice now was based on his own interests. He was being held back by EsGod, and Black Star was watching him from the dark. His chances of escaping were slim, so he decided to self-destruct before his condition fell to a dangerous state.

On one hand, it would cause the enemy’s sneak attack to fail, and on the other hand, his teammates did not have to come to support, thus minimizing losses.

Two birds with one stone!

Just one word, amazing!

Swoosh!

EsGod’s figure flashed, avoiding the shockwave of the self-destruction.

He had finally met an opponent he wanted to fight to his heart’s content, but he did not expect his opponent to explode just like that.

In his opinion, although the Subduing Tree King was at a disadvantage, he was still a Tree King level combatant. Even if he had the advantage, it would be extremely difficult to kill the other party. The current situation was far from the time to self-destruct... “Forget it, at least the target is settled.”

EsGod suddenly shook his head and laughed.

The situation of the battle was ever-changing. If the Subduing Tree King fought to the end, he might still have a chance to escape. However, since he decided to self-destruct now, there was no need to worry about any accidents.

Black Star’s order was to kill this guy. Now that his opponent had killed himself, he would be saving his energy.

On the other side, the Fortitude Tree King sensed the self-destruction of the Subduing Tree King and was shocked.

He felt that although the situation was not good, there was still a chance. Why did he give up the hope of survival? He could still be saved...

The Fortitude Tree King immediately received the Subduing Tree King’s mental fluctuations and understood what had happened.

“So, he did this because he was worried about being ambushed by the enemy...”

The Fortitude Tree King was speechless.

Due to the revival mechanism, this method of self-destructing to prevent the enemy from capturing them was very common for the World Tree members. The last time, the Subduing Tree King had died by self-destructing, but it was surprisingly similar this time as well...

The Fortitude Tree King did not know if he should say that the Subduing Tree King was decisive or a stupid teammate for falling in the same place twice.

With just one probing, they had lost a Tree King. He felt exhausted.

“Sigh, I can’t say that it’s a bad thing. He did die a little quickly, but it guaranteed that he won’t be sealed like the Heart Tree King.”

The Fortitude Tree King sighed in his heart. He could only think on the bright side... At least, the Subduing Tree King’s sacrifice was not completely worthless. He managed to probe out the enemy’s cards.

This unknown Esper who was not inferior to Black Star and that large-scale instant killing device that did not leave any traces must be the enemy’s trump cards.

With this information, his side would be able to prepare in advance the next time they fought... He had finally gained some benefits from this battle. He felt that the Subduing Tree King’s death was not a big loss.

It was a pity that this errand boy was gone. He could not slack off anymore. With this in mind, the Fortitude Tree King no longer had any thoughts of fighting. He suppressed the annoyance in his heart and immediately ordered a retreat.

“Let’s go!”

The World Tree experts stopped fighting and retreated. After paying a price, they finally returned to the main formation and were protected by the fleet again.

The Beyond Grade As of the three Universal Civilizations did not pursue after seeing this and retreated into the defense circle.

Seeing this, the expressions of the leaders of the three Universal Civilizations who were watching from afar relaxed, and they were secretly surprised.

Even before Black Star made a move, a portion of the Beyond Grade As had already given the World Tree experts a head-on blow, causing the enemies to suffer. In their eyes, this was undoubtedly the result of Black Star’s training over the past ten years.

“Although Black Star is unpredictable, he is still reliable in this field.”

“There shouldn’t be anyone in the entire Galactic Society who knows how to cultivate Supers better than him. Black Star has contributed a lot to such a huge improvement. His ten years of hard work has given us an advantage in terms of individual strength.”

The three of them were somewhat relieved.

At the same time.

In the base, Han Xiao raised his brows when he saw the Subduing Tree King explode into the most beautiful fireworks.

“He chose to self-destruct at this time... Could it be that he’s afraid that I’ll ambush him? Ha, isn’t he being too smart for his own good? Among the Pugilists, your stupidity is quite unique.”

Han Xiao could not help but laugh.

та

He did not plan to make a move, but he did not expect this inaction to scare the Subduing Tree King so much that he gave up his life... It could only be said that he had left quite a shadow in the World Tree’s heart.

This time, without his help, the other teammates had caused the World Tree to suffer a loss. Without a doubt, they had improved tremendously, and Hila and the others could even hold their own. He was very satisfied.

Most importantly, a portion of the Revivors and new Beyond Grade As held back their urges until the end of the battle and did not appear to join the battle. This meant that the Holy Accord’s Revivors were still not exposed, which was a good thing for Han Xiao.

The World Tree’s attack was obviously just a test, while his side only revealed the tip of the iceberg and did not reveal all their cards. They killed the Subduing Tree King while holding back some of their trump cards. Sending this annoying guy back home to rest was quite worth it!

As such, the World Tree did not receive any more intelligence, and it still maintained the incorrect judgment of the Exchange tactic being effective.

Han Xiao rubbed his chin and smiled.

“It seems like you guys don’t even have the right to enjoy this gift that I’ve prepared... That’s good too. I’ll give this surprise to you guys when you send out a powerful Tree King.”
