Chapter 1413 Battle and Emergence

On the white desert ravaged by the radiation storm, a bright light suddenly flashed. An expedition starship that was emitting flames emerged from the crack and fell down as if it had lost all its power. It crashed onto the ground, shaking up the white sand in the sky. Its momentum did not decrease, and it plowed a deep ravine on the ground.

The azure particle shield, which was on the verge of shattering, endured the impact and flickered like a light bulb with a loose circuit. Then, it disappeared, and the spaceship suddenly sank. Its head was inserted into the desert, and its tail was raised up high. The distorted thrusters exploded with sparks, and it finally malfunctioned, spewing out black smoke.

Clang! Clang! Clang! The hatch of the spaceship was stuck, and there was a sound of collision coming from inside. The alloy door protruded out, and then it was sent flying with a bang. The deformed hatch smashed onto the sand and slid out more than ten meters.

Harrison and the others walked out while holding onto the injured parts of their bodies. Their bodies swayed as if they had drunk fake wine. The gravity stabilization device and gyroscope of the spaceship had failed, and it fell to the ground.

One of the team members looked at the paralyzed spaceship and said in a panic, “Oh no, the spaceship is damaged. We can’t run anymore!”

“Don’t panic. The enemy hasn’t caught up. Hurry up and repair it.”

Harrison held his dizzy head, gritted his teeth, and ordered his teammates to repair the spaceship.

The outpost was attacked, and a large number of expedition teams fled in all directions. The World Tree Blessed Races pursued them relentlessly, and they also met the enemy. The team was left with only one spaceship, and it was not easy for them to shake off the pursuers. The spaceship that had endured the fierce attacks was pushed to the limit and broke down.

“I wonder how the outpost is doing,” one of the team members muttered. “It is definitely destroyed. The World Tree came prepared. With the armed forces of the outpost, it’s impossible for them to survive.”

“While we were escaping, the commander was still giving orders in the main control room. I’m afraid he has already sacrificed himself by self-destructing, living and dying with the base...”

The atmosphere in the crowd was filled with sadness. Having worked together for more than ten years, many of the expeditionary army members were already familiar with each other. At this time, the future of so many of their comrades looked ominous, and they were all worried.

“The situation of the World Tree attack should have been sent back to the main universe. Before I evacuated, I had already sent a message to His Excellency Black Star using the quantum network base station at the outpost. He should have received it, but he has yet to come to the rescue. I wonder...”

Harrison’s tone was hesitant. The moment he was attacked, he had sent out a request for help. While escaping, he had been protecting the ‘Throne’ that Black Star had given him. He had been waiting for Han Xiao to arrive, but there had been no response.

“Can we contact him again?” someone quickly asked.

“Not at the moment. There’s no linkable base station, so I can’t contact the outside world for the time being...”

Before Harrison could finish his sentence, a spatial fluctuation suddenly appeared on the spaceship, and Han Xiao walked out from the damaged cabin door. The moment everyone saw him, they were immediately surprised.

“Your Excellency Black Star! You’re finally here!”

“We’re saved!” Han Xiao raised his hand and gestured for them to control their emotions. He then looked at Harrison and sized him up. “Looks like you’re in good shape. You’re not injured.”

Harrison greeted him with a disappointed expression. “You’re too late. The outpost has fallen. They...”

Han Xiao interrupted him, nodded, and said, “Alright, I already know about this. Since the outpost is gone, so be it. The three Universal Civilizations have already sent people to pick up the other expeditionary army soldiers. I’m here to pick you up... and your teammates.”

When the emergency notification from the three Universal Civilizations had reached the main base in the Siebert Fortress, Han Xiao had already received Harrison’s request for help. The reason he had only rushed over now was that he had spent some time deploying the high-level combatants of the association and made a trip to the Realmless King’s side to protect the Pivotal Snake. He had hidden the Pivotal Snake in a secret place and only came to pick up Harrison after doing all these important things. Han Xiao was not afraid of anything happening to Harrison. He had been using the Observer’s Mark to monitor Harrison’s situation. Seeing that he was safe, he did not teleport over immediately.

“What about the outposts? Aren’t you going to reinforce them?” Harrison asked.

“There’s no need. The dimensional coordinates of the outposts have been exposed, so it’s not suitable to rebuild the base. Even if we want to rebuild the outpost, it will have to be somewhere else. The losses this time are not too big. The outposts have served their purpose over the years.” Han Xiao waved his hands.

The purpose of the outpost was only to facilitate the expeditionary army’s exploration of the deep layer dimensions, and the coordinates of the various dimensions had already been recorded into the database over the years. The coordinates of the Realmless King’s territory and the areas around the World Tree had already been controlled by the three Universal Civilizations, which meant that these places had become ‘new shallow layer dimensions’. Thanks to the special structure of the secondary dimension world, and since they had the coordinates, the subsequent troops could quickly jump over even without the outpost. They did not have to travel for many years like in normal exploration. This was the most important result.

As for the outpost itself, it did not have any irreplaceable value. With these coordinates in hand, it could be rebuilt at any time. Therefore, this loss was nothing in the eyes of the three Universal Civilizations. They were more concerned about the degree of information leakage. Harrison nodded and asked, “What do we do next?”

“I’ll take you to the base camp of the three Universal Civilizations in the secondary dimension world. They have already gathered their troops there and are preparing to deal with the possible attacks from the World Tree. This time, the coordinates might have been leaked, and the World Tree opening up the secondary dimensional battlefront should be a foregone conclusion. The three Universal Civilizations will have to face a two-way battle from now on... After sending you off, I’ll have a short meeting with the leaders of the three Universal Civilizations to discuss this matter.”

Han Xiao said casually with a calm tone.

At this time, there was a high chance that the World Tree was still cleaning up the battlefield in the various outposts, but he did not have any intention of retaliating. Even if he went over, the Secret Tree King might not appear, and he would alert the enemy on top of making a wasted trip. He might as well wait for the Secret Tree King to start a two-way battle and then give him a big slap. If the World Tree had the coordinates of the shallow layer dimensions, it would not take much time to jump over, and they might even start another round of blitzkrieg. Therefore, Han Xiao guessed that the Secret Tree King would not take too long. Han Xiao gave a simple explanation and did not say anything else. He took out a new carrier, set the coordinates of the destination, and called everyone to board the ship.

Everyone obediently accepted the arrangement. Compared to the other expeditionary army soldiers, this group of people was lucky enough to be received by Han Xiao personally and escape from danger thanks to Harrison’s luck glow.

The Galactic Alliance Army was divided into many smaller armies. The border defense army guarded the frontlines of the Flickering World, while the secondary dimension garrison was responsible for guarding the base camp in the shallow layer dimensions. This was the foundation of the three Universal Civilizations in the secondary dimension world. If it was destroyed, they would lose most of their control over the secondary dimension.

A few hours after the outposts were attacked, the garrisons in all the war zones in the shallow layer dimension were fully prepared for battle.

At this moment, in one of the shallow layer dimensions.

While the blue energy was being replenished, the scene was like an ocean. A dynasty fleet that belonged to the secondary dimension garrison floated in the air and waited quietly. All the battleships were specially designed for the secondary dimension. Compared to the dynasty’s standard heavy military starships, they were much slender and more balanced.

“I’ve just received news that a war has broken out at the Flickering World’s frontline, and the World Tree Army has launched another attack. At this juncture, it’s very likely to be a double-layered tactic of the enemy, so the enemy can appear at any time. Everyone, focus!”

In the main ship, the commander spoke in the military channel.

The dynasty soldiers of the various fleets were extremely focused and did not dare to be distracted.

After waiting for a while, the fleet commander suddenly received the order from the other troops. His eyes narrowed, and he said with a deep voice, “The World Tree Army has already attacked. Thirty-four war zones have been invaded, and the other garrison troops are exchanging fire. The enemy will be here soon...”

As soon as he said that, the space wall suddenly opened up with jump points like beehives. The World Tree’s Blessed Races swarmed out like a green flood.

“Attack!”

The fleet commander roared.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The next moment, countless beams of energy lit up in the battlefield and formed a dense net, shattering a large group of battleships.

The two troops were fearless. It was as if they had turned into two giant beasts, one black and one green. They started to bite each other ferociously, not caring about their own injuries. They only cared about ripping off the flesh of the other party.

The same thing was happening in hundreds of shallow layer dimensions. War had broken out!

The warfare mode of the secondary dimensions was different from that of the main universe. Every war zone was a divided battlefield. With the help of the special ‘geographical’ structure, countless fleets fought as they traveled through the various secondary dimensions while carrying out operations like restraining, pulling, encircling, and counter encirclement. The situation changed rapidly, and the flames of war engulfed countless small worlds. The secondary dimensions were blasted into smithereens, and their remains were devoured by the space storms. The high-level combatants of both sides also started to fight each other, and the battlefield changed from one dimension to another.

In a shallow layer dimension war zone riddled with holes, a transportation door hung high up in the sky, spitting out a few injured Beyond Grade As from the three Universal Civilizations. Not far away, a green transportation door opened, and more Holy Tree Emissaries chased after them.

The few Beyond Grade As did not have time to recuperate and quickly turned around to fight. They were once again at a disadvantage, and the situation became worse. “Don’t even think about leaving the secondary dimension world alive!”

The Holy Tree Emissaries were filled with killing intent, and their attacks were ferocious. Their eyes were even flashing with joy.

In the past, when they fought with the Beyond Grade As of the three Universal Civilizations, due to the existence of the Healing Esper, all the high-level combatants of the enemy were like a death squad, making them feel extremely miserable. They could not even feel the joy of the World Tree’s infinite revival.

However, it was different now. In the secondary dimension battlefield, due to the special battlefield structure, the Healing Esper would be greatly restricted and would not be able to take care of every battlefield... Furthermore, the Healing Esper did not even have the time to come over. The troops in the main universe launched an attack, dragging many enemy high-level combatants to the frontlines, including the Healing Esper.

Now that they saw the enemy being restrained again, the Holy Tree Emissaries were finally overjoyed. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Austin was among the Beyond Grade As that were surrounded. Half of his magic treasures had been destroyed, and he was struggling to resist the attacks.

“The situation isn’t looking good. Without reinforcements, we will definitely suffer losses.”

Even with the Sanctum Revival, most people did not wish for themselves to end up in such a state. There was only one Aurora, and everyone wanted to stay on the front line and fight alongside the milkmaid. Therefore, there were very few high-level combatants who were willing to rush to reinforce the troops in the shallow layer dimensions. Other than the direct descendants, none of the others were willing. They were all ordered to come and help, and there was a huge difference in numbers with the enemy. The situation did not look good.

By the side, Beiger was fighting with a high-level Holy Tree Emissary, and they were locked in an intense battle. He whispered, “Don’t panic, we still have reinforcements.”

“What reinforcements?” Austin frowned.

At this moment, the space wall in the distance of the battlefield suddenly opened up, and an unmarked fleet charged into the battlefield, firing densely packed sharp missiles at the World Tree Blessed Races, which exploded on the shields.

The next moment, the area where the missiles exploded turned into chaotic space. A batch of World Tree Blessed Race members was sucked into it and disappeared without a trace. “This is...” Austin’s pupils constricted. “The Holy Accord’s Dimensional Exile Bullet,” Beiger continued. “Holy Accord? What is...”

Before Austin could ask further, waves of Beyond Grade A energy soared into the sky.

Boom!

A few unfamiliar Beyond Grade As flew out from this mysterious fleet, quickly closing in on the Holy Tree Emissaries.

Austin felt the pressure lessen, and he quickly backed away. He looked at the battle and was shocked.

“These are the reinforcements you mentioned? Who are they?”

“Don’t you find them familiar?” Beiger raised an eyebrow.

Austin looked over and immediately recognized a few people. They were all famous Primordial Ones in history.

Thinking about Beiger’s identity, he suddenly realized something. “They’re Revivors like you? I thought Black Star did not revive them. When did this happen ?”

“You will know the details later. Now is not the time to talk about it.”

Beiger did not explain further and dodged the enemy’s counterattack. A forbidden spell ray penetrated the enemy’s chest.

Austin’s heart skipped a beat. He looked at them deeply and did not ask any more questions.

Similar scenes were happening in many of the war zones. The dozens of revivors who had been hidden in the Holy Accord for many years finally joined the battle for the first time, helping the Beyond Grade As and quickly stabilizing the situation of the high-level combatants.

Not only was the World Tree surprised by this wave of reinforcements, but even the three Universal Civilizations were confused. They could not figure out the origins of these reinforcements.

At the same time.

The leaders of the three Universal Civilizations, who were monitoring the battle in the secondary dimension, all turned to look at Han Xiao, who was watching the battle together in the office. Their expressions were mixed with shock and complicated emotions.

“Black Star... aren’t you going to explain?’”
