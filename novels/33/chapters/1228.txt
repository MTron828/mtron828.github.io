Chapter 1230 Werewolf Becoming the Detective

The next day, with the Beyond Grade A Association taking the lead, all the Beyond Grade A organizations made a joint announcement. They claimed that this was an insult to the association and that the association would assist the Crimson Dynasty in finding the culprit to avenge Gaud.As so many Beyond Grade As used their influence to search for clues, it instantly caused chain reactions in the Flickering World, affecting countless normal organizations.

The dynasty also made a public response based on the Beyond Grade A Association’s announcement, praising Vice President Black Star’s act of taking the lead, not at all mentioning Manison, the actual president. The difference in treatment was clear.

At the same time, the Beyond Grade A Association publicized a universe kill order. Every member chipped in some money, making up an outrageous reward as high as four billion Enas. Among them, the Black Star Army alone contributed half a billion, expressing their determination to find the culprit to the outside world.

The outrageously high reward immediately triggered the enthusiasm of the entire Flickering World. Almost everyone was guessing who the real culprit was every day.

Plus, the dynasty exploration army dispatched a ton of manpower and resources to search for clues, causing the focus of the Flickering World to shift. Although the Flickering World was still the main focus of the galactic residents, the search for Gaud also attracted a lot of attention. Other than fighting in the war, these organizations were also sending their men all over to look for clues.

The federation and the church did not only watch either. They both made announcements stating that they felt just as provoked as the dynasty was and would be sending forces to assist the dynasty in their investigation.

Organizations in the galaxy got questioned one after another. The dynasty collected all kinds of information related to the time surrounding the incident, but they had yet to find any clues.

...

In the remote conference room of the Super Star Cluster Alliance, a meeting was being held.

“... After this, there’s no way the dynasty will put it behind them. They’ll have to settle it no matter what. Never mind if they solve it, but if they end up not being able to solve it, they’ll undoubtedly find a temporary ‘culprit’ to take the blame, save the dynasty’s reputation, and vent their anger. We’re the best choice for the dynasty.”

The remote projections were all of the Super Star Cluster civilization leaders. Listening to the Star Arc Civilization leader speak, everyone had a serious expression.

At the start, they had doubted one of their own and asked if they did it as soon as they met, thinking this was the stupid act of one of their allies. However, after sharing their internal information, only then did they clear each other’s doubts and unite on this matter.

The Star Arc Civilization leader brought up his opinion at the right timing, receiving agreement from many other leaders.

Everyone knew that their situation was against them. Whether the dynasty could find the real culprit or not, the Super Star Cluster Alliance would still very likely take the blame. The three Universal Civilizations would definitely not mind using this opportunity to frame them for a crime they did not commit.

The Tragedy of the Pinnacles was a bloody lesson. No Super Star Cluster civilization wished for that to happen again, so they had no choice but to let the three Universal Civilizations take the moral high ground among the public and toy with them. Therefore, the Star Arc Civilization leader spoke to their hearts.

The others nodded. “That’s right. We can’t sit and wait for our doom. We have to turn the situation around. Explaining ourselves won’t work. It’s best to find a clear ‘culprit’ and announce it so that the three Universal Civilizations can’t use this against us... Manison is a suitable target.”

Seeing this, the Star Arc Civilization leader heaved a sigh of relief and smiled with satisfaction.

He had brought this proposal up in the meeting because he wanted the help of the entire Super Star Cluster Alliance.

They would only have a higher chance of making Manison take the blame if they worked together; the Star Arc Civilization alone was not enough.

Now, the entire Super Star Cluster Alliance had come to an agreement to frame Manison.

...

In the Mechanic Emperor’s secret base, Manison did not look happy. He hung up the call from the federation and frowned slightly.

“The dynasty’s request is too much, telling me to show all my Felons, submit the logbooks of all the spaceships under my command, and even open up the memory database of all my mechanical soldiers for them to check... Hehe, they say they hope I can cooperate with the investigation, but they’ve actually already marked me as the main suspect. The only thing that’s left to do is to bring me over and interrogate me.”

Manison shook his head. He could clearly see that the three Universal Civilizations were also planning to use this opportunity to find out the coordinates of his various bases.

Although he did not do it, he was not so naive as to think he could stay out of it completely.

From Manison’s perspective, the Super Star Cluster Alliance was most likely the culprit. The Super Star Cluster Alliance would certainly not be willing to sit and wait for their doom, so they would definitely do something about it. Manison, however, happened to be between the three Universal Civilizations and the Super Star Cluster Alliance and was the most suspicious. He was the most suitable sacrifice; someone was probably going to pin the incident on him.

“I must prepare some way to fight back and make the Super Star Cluster Alliance take the blame they deserve... Hmm, speaking of which, if they try to frame me, that should prove they’re the real culprits.”

Manison’s thoughts were very clear.

If possible, he might have wanted to frame Black Star and teach that b*stard a lesson.

However, that was way too difficult to do, almost impossible really, so he could only forget about that idea.

...

In the Holy Accord organization’s base...

“To think that this happened in the outside world...”

The various revived Primordial Ones gathered, watched the images on the communicator in Oathkeeper’s hands, and chatted continuously.

“The times are so terrifying now. Even an Esper Ability as powerful as Energy Control has appeared.”

“Pity, he got killed right after he entered the Beyond Grade A territory. Black Star is indeed right. The world outside is dangerous.

“This culprit messed up. No matter how perfectly he executed the plan, as soon as the dynasty figures out the Sanctums and revives Gaud, the truth would be revealed...”

The others nodded.

Oathkeeper, however, was a little worried. “If the dynasty can’t find the culprit, once you revivors appear, the dynasty will suspect you guys too. This isn’t good news.”

Beiger sighed and said, “So, we’re affected by the culprit too. We’ll have to be more cautious when we decide to go public.”

The people sighed and felt that the problem had just fallen down the sky out of nowhere.

...

In the Black Star Army Commander’s office, Han Xiao said in his chair. Virtual screens hovered before him, displaying the activities on the quantum network.

Over the past few days, he had been doing this to pay attention to the direction this matter was taking. He had witnessed the spark he lit spread like wildfire, affecting bigger and bigger areas. He felt more and more like a mastermind behind the curtains stirring up storms in the universe.

“This is probably going to be the norm for some time. The dynasty will not stop till they find the real culprit, it’s like a hornet nest.”

At this time, his communicator suddenly rang. He took it out. It was surprisingly a call from Tarrokov.

As he picked it up, Old Tar’s remote projection appeared in the room.

“Old Marshal, it’s been some time.”

Tarrokov nodded and said with a serious expression, “Black Star, I’ll keep things short. The dynasty needs your help now.”

“Go ahead.”

“Gaud has been missing for many days. The dynasty has already searched all the records of the area within a month’s duration before and after the incident, but we have yet to find any solid evidence. Therefore, the upper echelons have decided to form a task force especially in charge of this matter. The dynasty hopes to invite you to join as an expert, relying on your abilities to search for leads on the quantum network. What do you think?”

Han Xiao almost laughed out loud.

“Ahem, I’m the consultant of the three Universal Civilizations. This is my duty. I’m ready anytime.”

“Okay. The task force will gather online in a day’s time. If you can find any clue, the dynasty will reward you generously.”

Tarrokov did not waste any time. He pointed out a few more things and hung up the call right after. He had been busy as hell lately; he really had no time to stay for a chat.

Han Xiao put the communicator down and smirked. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

As a werewolf, I successfully got others to believe I’m the seer and even got voted as the detective!

By inviting him, the mastermind, to investigate this case, anyone could be captured but the real culprit...

Furthermore, he would even join as an expert, meaning he had a lot of control over the direction of the investigation. With his capabilities, doing something without anyone noticing was too easy.

This way, he had more targets he could frame...

However, forging clues was still risky. Han Xiao planned to be cautious and see how the ‘suspects’ reacted.

While he was being secretly glad, a notification suddenly popped up on the interface.
