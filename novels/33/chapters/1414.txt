Chapter 1415 Overwhelming Combat Strength; Wrecking the Tree God

The Emperor Skysplitter Blade and the psionic wave launcher had already been enhanced by Han Xiao’s (Beyonder Artifact] to become a ‘Divine Artifact’. With just a simple press of the A button, its power was no different from a destructive ultimate move!

(TL Note: The author is probably expressing the huge damage caused by a normal attack, hence describing it as the press of an A button like a normal attack on a console.]

Facing the Secret Tree King’s terrified gaze, the Emperor Sky Splitter stabbed forward. The huge blade expanded rapidly in his eyes, and he could not react in time.

Boom!

The huge blade slammed into the dimensional wall of the secondary dimension, creating countless cracks like cracking porcelain. The power of the attack was transmitted to the entire secondary dimension, exceeding the upper limit. The entire shadow dimension exploded, and all the darkness dissipated.

However, the Secret Tree King was not sent flying. Instead, it was firmly stuck to the tip of the blade by an intense gravitational force field. At the same time, the Supreme Heavenly Venerate extended a finger and pressed it against the Secret Tree King’s body. The invisible power of the Spacetime Amber passed through his finger and began to make amber on the Secret Tree King’s body. The soul link of the Spacetime Amber had already reached the highest fifth level in the past decade. There was no need to touch the target with the original body of the Spacetime Amber, only physical contact was needed to activate the seal. This meant that the Spacetime Amber no longer needed to be carried around, and it could be placed anywhere.

At the same time, due to the [Energy BaseGod of All Machines] talent of the Super God Mechanic, the form of his basic existence was not limited to his physical body. The Mechanical Deity that he had fused with was also his main body. This meant that he could use the Mechanical Deity’s body to touch the target, which would also satisfy the judgment of the Spacetime Amber!

The Secret Tree King was rooted to the ground by a bunch of Universal Treasure-level control devices. The extremely destructive psionic energy waves flowed along the blade and entered his body, crushing large amounts of his cells. The energy in his body was suppressed by the Super God-level energy, and he could not even self-destruct. Furthermore, he did not dare to self-destruct in front of a Super God. That was truly ‘courting death’.

Black Star was too fast, exceeding the Beyond Grade A realm. He could not react much at all, as if he had fallen into such a state the moment he came back to his senses.

“How can someone break through this limit? This kind of power cannot be controlled by an individual!”

The Secret Tree King panicked, his face pale.

He did not expect a Tree God to appear in this civilization. How could there be such a huge change in just ten years?

The World Tree had been growing for countless years. Other than the Ancestral Tree King, the other four Kings had all changed positions before. Although the Ancestral Tree King had the authority to remove the other Kings, he rarely used them. Generally speaking, unless the Tree King was dead, he would not do any personnel changes.

However, the Tree Kings could revive, so why would they still die? This was the problem. Some of the Tree Kings had tried to reach a higher level, but all of them died without exception. They thought that they could revive through the World Tree, but after suffering from mutations and dying during the Promotion, the information form would directly leave the connection of the World Tree, unable to revive and be completely dead. After failing time and time again, they learned from the previous mistakes, and the later generations of Tree Kings did not try to advance anymore.

In their eyes, the Transcendent Domain was an insurmountable chasm that could not be crossed by an individual. It was the limit of a single life form. Only by using a different method could one temporarily step into a higher level. The Tree God advent was one of the methods.

This kind of thinking was not strange. Having a powerful Superpower system did not mean that one could become stronger indefinitely. Although many civilizations liked to confuse the differences between the two, these were two different concepts. Be it the World Tree experts or the Beyond Grade As of the three Universal Civilizations, they all were similar in that they recognized the existence of an individual limit... The difference lay in how both parties had determined the limits of their individual strength. Because up till now, no one had truly reached the absolute limit, thus there appeared many different boundaries of strength.

“I have to break free from his control, or else...”

The Secret Tree King made up his mind and activated his cell reactor crazily. Ignoring the damage to his cells, he squeezed out all his magic power and attacked the energy lock. After struggling without caring about the consequences, the control field finally loosened.

“There’s still a chance to escape!”

The Secret Tree King was overjoyed. Just as he was about to accumulate his strength to burst out and break through Han Xiao’s control, the power of the Tree King in his body suddenly leaked out like a flood and was sucked away by an invisible force. His body suddenly sagged, and his accumulation of strength was interrupted. A sense of weakness spread throughout his body.

“My Tree King Crown!”

He suddenly raised his eyes and looked in the direction of the Ancestral Tree King.

The Ancestral Tree King’s figure was already covered by a rapidly expanding ball of green light. It was like a gigantic egg, and a gigantic figure could be vaguely seen within. The energy fluctuations from within were rising rapidly.

How could the Secret Tree King not recognize this scene? The Ancestral Tree King had already activated the descent of the Tree God and instantly retracted his Tree King Crown as well as his strength. It was obvious that he had abandoned him to reduce the overall losses on their side. Not only did he not plan to save him, but he had even destroyed his hope of escaping! “No!”

The Secret Tree King’s eyes widened in shock.

Han Xiao noticed the change in the Ancestral Tree King and looked back. He then looked down at the Secret Tree King and said in a joking manner.

“We agreed to spend some alone time together. I didn’t expect you to secretly make it into a threesome... Alright, go to sleep. I’ll play with him first.”

As soon as he said that, he suddenly moved his finger, and the Spacetime Amber took shape!

Deng! The terror on the Secret Tree King’s face froze as if he could not believe that he was taken down so easily. His entire body was frozen in amber.

“Success!”

Han Xiao’s eyes sparkled.

The Secret Tree King was extremely strong among the Beyond Grade As, but he could not do much damage to him. Although it was a sudden attack, it was mainly because of the huge difference in strength that the Secret Tree King did not have the time to use all sorts of methods before being defeated.

Compared to the various schemes he had used to seal the Heart Tree King before, sealing an even stronger Secret Tree King this time was much easier. His strength had exceeded an entire realm, and although it was not as simple as a Beyond Grade A fighting a Calamity Grade Super, it was still a crushing victory.

The next moment, a channel opened up on the fingertips of the mechanical finger, swallowing the ambered Secret Tree King.

After doing this, Han Xiao turned around and faced the rapidly expanding green light belonging to the Ancestral Tree King. Seeing this, Han Xiao’s eyes sparkled. He could roughly guess why the Secret Tree King had fled so decisively and was so afraid of him.

“So that’s how it is. The World Tree also has the power of a Beyond God. The reason why the Secret Tree King has no fighting spirit is that he has seen this power before... Maybe the Transcendent Grade of the World Tree has already unlocked the ability to kill using the information form state. Therefore, in his opinion, whether he self-destructs or not, I can directly attack him in the information state and kill him completely, since I can break the mechanism of the World Tree and strip him of his immortality. That’s why the Secret Tree King is so afraid of me...”

Han Xiao immediately became alert.

“If that’s the case, doesn’t that mean that the Transcendent Grade of the World Tree can also threaten me?”

Without another word, he opened fire at the green light. He had no habit of waiting for others to transform.

Right at this moment, the green light suddenly exploded, and a gigantic tree palm extended out from the light. Green light gushed out from the palm and turned into a barrier, blocking the torrential attacks of the mechanical army.

The figure of the Ancestral Tree King had already disappeared, and in its place was a gigantic treant. His entire body was glowing with green light, and countless World Tree Roots were wrapped around his body like woven vine armor. On every part of his body, many small roots grew out like dancing little snakes, tearing open space cracks one after another and absorbing the matter and energy on the other side of the tunnel.

“What f*ckery is this?”

Han Xiao glanced at the interface. The other party’s name was (Tree God (Incomplete)], and a large amount of information was filled with question marks. It was clear that its level was higher than his, and it was also at the Transcendent Grade.

“Interesting, the World Tree still has such a method hidden. Why have they never used it before...”

Han Xiao frowned, pondering in suspicion.

In the war in his previous life, the World Tree had never used this method. Logically speaking, since their nest had been destroyed, they should have used all their trump cards to stop the enemy. However, even when the three Universal Civilizations blew up the World Tree’s main body, the Tree God never descended.

He originally thought that the World Tree did not have the strength of a Transcendent, but it seemed like that was not the case. There were definitely secrets that he did not understand.

At this moment, a mental signal came from the Tree God. There was no clear content, only messy thoughts and intense hunger, much like a wild beast.

“Are you trying to eat me?”

Han Xiao could sense the meaning behind Tree God’s words, and his heart skipped a beat.

It seemed like the mind of this Tree God was very chaotic, and he did not have a rational leader controlling it?!

Before he could observe any longer, the Tree God pounced on him and started entangling with the Supreme Heavenly Venerate.

Countless roots of the World Tree shot out, glowing with a green light as they smashed toward Han Xiao’s body. They were continuously cut by the Emperor Skysplitter Blade, but new ones quickly grew out.

One was a machine, and the other was a tree. Two huge objects were brawling it out in the space storm. Dozens of Mechanical Oracles led their troops and fired at the Tree God. Every moment, countless attacks landed on the Tree God. However, its health seemed to have no limit. Not only did the body formed by the World Tree Root have high resistance, but it also possessed extraordinary regenerative power.

Oathkeeper and Clotti had already moved far away. The aftershock of the battle between the two Transcendents was too terrifying, and they had no room to interfere. They could only follow behind and watch from afar.

“I didn’t expect the World Tree to also have the combat power of a Transcendent Grade, to be able to fight Black Star head-on. If they had used it earlier...”

Clotti’s eyes widened in shock.

“Can’t you tell? This Beyond God level combatant doesn’t seem to be an individual. The World Tree Civilization must have paid some price to create a Transcendent Grade level combatant.” Oathkeeper shook his head and analyzed calmly. “Furthermore, he and Black Star aren’t evenly matched. Look, he’s already at a disadvantage.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Due to the incomplete Tree King Crowns, the Tree God advent this time was not complete, and its combat capability was not at its peak. After fighting for a while, the Tree God gradually fell into a disadvantage under Han Xiao’s fierce attacks. It could only rely on its strong physical strength to resist the attacks, and the number of times it attacked decreased.

Han Xiao also felt the weakness of the Tree God, and he started to analyze.

Although he is at the Transcendent Grade, his combat power seems to be lacking. It should be because of that ‘incomplete’ title. This is not the complete form of the Tree God yet... Could I have been involved in this?

Han Xiao’s thoughts raced. Although he did not know the conditions for the Tree God’s Advent, when he thought about how one of his requirements was to find Supers from the other four classes as helpers when he advanced to the Transcendent Grade, he had a vague guess.

The composition of the five Tree Kings is similar to the requirement to advance to the Transcendent Grade. Could this be the birth condition of the Tree God? If that’s the case, I’ve sealed the Heart Tree King and the Secret Tree King, so the complete version of the Tree God cannot be activated?

The more Han Xiao thought about it, the more likely it seemed.

Does this mean that I accidentally weakened the other party’s trump card?!

Amazing! Let’s see who dares to say that I’m unlucky in the future. I might be usually unlucky, but I’ve never failed at a critical moment!
