Chapter 554: It Is Time to Show My True Imagination

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The Sanctuary was filled with an endless sea of people, and countless players surrounded Ames. Those who were far away were either standing on tiptoes, stretching their necks, or jumping up and down with excitement.

The majority of the players on Planet Aquamarine had seen Bun-Hit-Dog’s videos before, and they all recognized the Dragon Emperor. Her fame among the players was only slightly inferior to that of Black Star. It was not only because of her beauty and sexy long legs. Most of the players had also seen many pretty female NPCs. The most important point was her strength. She was like an Empress with exalted status and the most powerful character that those players on Planet Aquamarine had seen.

With the huge gap in their status, her popularity had soared and never come back down. On the forums, there were even fans who had created a ‘Dragon Emperor leg licking group’.

Talking about the name of fan clubs, Han Xiao’s ‘Black Star little mercenary family’ and ‘Captain love me once back up group’ were not any much better.

In the past, the players could only see Ames through videos, but this time, she had actually descended personally. The entire Sanctuary was immediately overwhelmed with shock, and many players called their friends and brought all their family members over to witness Ames in person.

While they really wanted to rush forward and hug her smooth legs, the players all kept their distance from her. Not to mention whether or not they were able to activate the ‘taking off their pants’ and ‘lick NPC’ features, just witnessing Ames casually flattening a bunch of players who went near her was a huge deterrent. After all, none of them wanted to lose experience for nothing.

What a joke! She was a character who could destroy a star! What if she ended up destroying their Novice Village!

Ames looked at the endless players with curiosity. Those Space Wonders that Black Star had mentioned seemed to know her, and they all had excited looks on their faces. She could not help but feel that they were all treating her like an animal in the zoo.

After using her ability to scan the players, she found nothing special with the physique of the Inhumans. However, the couple of fellows who she had slapped to death previously had transformed into a white light and disappeared, not leaving behind a corpse. Her force field was able to differentiate between the millions of individuals, and in less than ten seconds, the few Inhumans whom she had slapped to death had entered the vicinity of her senses again. They had indeed revived.

If all of them had an undying body, even if they were slightly weaker, they could not be underestimated.

After this thought surfaced in her head, she immediately threw it to the back of her head. At her current realm, there was no need for her to pay too much attention to them. However, those Inhumans were truly intriguing, and they were pretty different from Aroshia.

It isn’t a bad thing for Black Star to gather them, Ames thought to herself.

Since she would not be able to discover anything in this short period of time, Ames looked around before flying out of the crowd and toward the location that Black Star had told her.

The players in the plaza had already taken numerous pictures from all possible angles.

After she left, all the players began to chatter excitedly.

“I never expected to see the Dragon Emperor in person. How beautiful...”

“I seem to have fallen in love...”

“How useless! A single beauty caused all of you to lose all composure! Unprincipled and without a bottom line! Can’t you guys learn from me? I will love Feidin forever!”

Apart from those uploading Ames’ pictures onto the forums, there were a few who were guessing the reason for her appearance.

“How strange. Ames should be someone at the very top of the food chain. Why did she come to Planet Aquamarine? I feel that we shouldn’t be coming into contact with someone like her at this phase...”

“Do you still need to guess? It is already written on the Wayne Cards. Go back and copy the effects of the Black Star card a hundred times as punishment.”

“Black Star is Black Star indeed. So what if she is his boss? He will pull her along if he wants to.”

Everyone knew that the Black Star Mercenary Group had the title of Floating Dragon Island’s Field Team. They had powerful backing. When the Black Star Mercenary Group shot forward in fame and prestige, Godora would not even be able to see their taillights.

To a certain extent, Han Xiao’s faction enjoyed a portion of Floating Dragon Island’s fame with the most important factor being Ames’ personal charisma. Joining the Black Star Mercenary Group was akin to having an opportunity to grow closer to Ames. This logic had attracted endless people to fight for the opportunity to join the mercenary group.

“However, why did Black Star call the Dragon Emperor over? Is it for the Mutation Disaster?”

“That can’t be right? The Mutation Disaster shouldn’t be enough for Ames to take action, right?”

The players continued their discussions, and the platform of their discussions changed to the forums.

The majority of the players were extremely excited about the Main Storyline of the Mutation Disaster, and they all felt as though an amazing reversal would suddenly take place. However, this guess of theirs was not without any basis. With the appearance of Ames, she was the best ‘evidence’ for their guesses.

Talking about Ames, Han Xiao naturally would not be left out of the conversation, and his fame was also increased even further. Han Xiao bringing Ames over gave the players of Planet Aquamarine a great deal of face. They could look at the other novice planets with the pride of ‘my novice planet might explode, will yours?’

...

Nagakin did not delay for a single second and personally escorted the Mutation Source back to the Godoran mothership. After the negotiations with Godora, Han Xiao had a carefree expression on his face as he walked toward the Sanctuary’s gathering point while considering his future development plans.

Godora needed time to carry out their research, but this was not a big problem to Han Xiao. Han Xiao’s level of patience had reached the point where even when a fish was on his hook, the fish would become more anxious than him.

I only need to wait. Godora will need about a month or so to develop the antidote, and DarkStar can behave arrogantly for a little while longer. However, their plans won’t be able to cause much trouble with so little time.

After handing over the Mutation Source, Han Xiao did not have anything to do before Godora developed the antidote. The safety of Planet Aquamarine was not an issue either. The intelligence network of DarkStar would definitely have noticed Ames’ arrival, and it was impossible for them to create trouble at this moment.

“What should I do over the next month? There isn’t a need for me to worry about disaster relief, and the hiring of players is already on track. The Mutation Disaster won’t change too much within a month, and the benefits that I can gain from imparting those skills are also dwindling. With the players all leveling up, there isn’t much I can extract from them like before...”

Could it be that he also had to join the club of killing time with cards?

No! He could not! Even if he was bored to death, he would not play cards!

It seems like I can only go into seclusion and manufacture machineries.

I earned 3,000,000 Enas from Godora, and together with my remaining 1,000,000, the funds on my hands exceed 4,000,000 again. Hmm, since I have money, I can buy some new Class Knowledge and increase my combat equipment...

Han Xiao’s eyes lit up.

That’s right, I still have to create a base on Planet Aquamarine and connect it to the universe officially. Only then will I have a never-ending supply of new players. It seems like I can move my plans forward.

He did not even need to think about the location and could just remodel the Sanctuary. Bennett definitely would not mind.

The materials were all readily available, and he could purchase some important facilities from the merchants in the universe. As for the construction progress... he would be a fool if he did not use the endless free labor. He could still issue them missions to ensure that they had a wholesome player life. Afterall, even the healthiest crops needed to be fed fertilizer.

He would model it after the equipment used in his first base, and even if the Six Nations wanted to send an atomic missile, his base would remain standing.

I now have something to do in this period of time.

With the idea in his mind, Han Xiao went back to the main hall of the gathering point, and when he was about to inform Herlous about this matter, he realized that Ames was already waiting there with Herlous and his other subordinates standing by the side respectfully. In the distance, there were many players looking over with faces full of excitement.

Ever since the players displayed enough strength to wipe out the beasts, his subordinates had returned to the Sanctuary to skive off. Under their lead, the entire hall had been transformed into a large room for them to play cards. A couple of players who were bored would occasionally come over to play some cards with them.

“You’re here.” Herlous hurriedly greeted. With Ames beside him, he felt an immense sense of pressure. Every single word that came out of his mouth had to be said with caution as he was afraid that he might end up offending Ames.

Han Xiao walked over and looked at Ames with a smile. “Have you seen the Inhumans?”

“You’re right; they are very interesting.” Ames looked at Han Xiao and retracted her aura. She no longer tested the subordinates under Han Xiao, and all the mercenaries felt their body ease up immediately. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“I will have someone arrange a room for you. Since there isn’t anything for you to do, there will be plenty of time for you to observe them.”

Ames smiled and said, “Alright.”

Since she was already there, she naturally did not leave immediately after seeing the players. She would take the opportunity to take a look at Black Star’s hometown as well.

“Right, I just negotiated with Godora using Floating Dragon’s name. They are very thankful toward you.”

“Hmm.”

“The Godorans should come and visit you later. I will make arrangements.”

“Alright, you can just manage it yourself.”

“You seem to be interested in Aurora and Hila’s abilities. I will introduce them to you later.”

“Sure.”

The both of them smiled.

Ames was an easy-going person and was not someone who put on airs. Since Han Xiao had already made arrangements, she would just accept them. After a few days of interaction, she was also used to interacting with Han Xiao in such a tone.

Besides, she did not dislike Han Xiao.

However, this resulted in a misunderstanding in the eyes of others.

The Dragon Emperor had always been mysterious, and the others did not understand Ames’ temperament like Han Xiao. The majority of them had not even met this boss of theirs. In their minds, the Dragon Emperor should be an imposing expert who would turn their legs to jelly with a single glance. She should not have been someone so easy to talk to, no matter what. Furthermore, she had obviously given them a huge amount of pressure previously, and the pressure had only disappeared after Han Xiao’s appearance.

As for Herlous and the few who had met the Dragon Emperor before, they realized that Ames’ attitude toward Han Xiao was extremely different from before. She was more than ten times gentler than previously.

It could be said that she completely listened to Han Xiao’s words, and her gentle tone was completely different from the persona of the high and mighty Dragon Emperor. Furthermore, the tone that she used to speak to them previously was obviously different. Only someone deaf would not be able to notice this difference, and it was impossible for them to not overthink it!

Could it be that the two of them...

Had that kind of a relationship‽

Herlous’ eyes widened as he looked at Han Xiao’s back in disbelief.

The Volga brothers were dumbfounded.

Feidin touched his cheeks subconsciously.

At that moment, the heart of those few officers were stirred.

Harmon could only feel the strange atmosphere. Looking left and right, he did not understand what was going on.

The jaws of those players watching far away dropped.

In the crowd, Bun-Hit-Dog witnessed this scene and his eyes lit up as inspiration immediately came to his head!

No wonder Black Star was able to casually call Ames over! So, this is the reason!

The Wayne Card didn’t lie to me!

Bun-Hit-Dog’s breathing became heavy as a large essay was formulated in his head.

This... picking up his superior, gaining both wealth and backing.

He was even able to subdue someone like Ames! Black Star’s charisma is too frightening!

“BIG NEWS!” Bun-Hit-Dog prepared the recording excitedly.

...

After an hour, in some remote region of Planet Aquamarine was the hiding place of the DarkStar spies.

“Eh, after leaving for half a month, Black Star has come back. I wonder what he went to do.”

One of the spies then turned on the satellite image, and after giving it a casual glance, it was as though a hammer had struck his head, and he was frozen in place.

Rubbing his eyes, he rewatched the footage more than ten times from different angles. Only after rubbing until his eyes turned red was he certain that he did not imagine it.

Did I just see the Dragon Emperor Ames‽

That monster who is able to destroy a DarkStar mothership?

“Quick quick quick... report this up to our superiors! Emergency report!”

The spy immediately ran over to his captain and was frightened to the point he almost wet his pants.
