Chapter 1394 Crushed By Auto-Attacks

At this moment, on the Crimson Dynasty mother planet, in the Ruler’s office.

In the room, the remote surveillance was showing the scene of EsGod’s prison. Marbruce had his hands on his nose, his sharp eyes staring at Black Star in the image, paying attention to the development of the scene.

“Why did this guy take the risk to do this back then...”

Marbruce muttered to himself.

Back then, he had listened to Bekorodi’s suggestion and suspected that Black Star was behind Gaud’s disappearance. However, Urranrell was the one in charge back then, so it was not convenient for him to interfere.

After he became the next Ruler, it was not suitable for him to thoroughly investigate Black Star, so he kept the matter under control.

The only motive that Marbruce could think of was that Gaud had once tried to simulate the Evolution Cube’s ability, which was why Black Star had attacked. As for the idea of Black Star killing a talented rookie, from the series of events with the World Tree, he felt that the possibility of Black Star doing so was low.

“The problem with the Evolution Cube shouldn’t have made him take such a risk. Black Star rarely does anything unnecessary. He probably had other reasons for secretly capturing Gaud...”

Marbruce pondered about the excuses.

He glanced at Gaud, who looked like he had been abused, and was even more furious. For a direct descendant to be treated like this, it was a disgrace to their dynasty.

If Black Star used the excuse of Evolution Cube, he would not accept it.

‘However... even if I don’t accept his explanation, so what?’

Marbruce sighed in his heart.

Now that the situation was dire, and Black Star was fully grown, the three Universal Civilizations also needed the association’s strength to fight the enemies. Even if Black Star could not give him a satisfactory explanation, he helplessly realized that he could not do anything to the other party and did not dare retaliate.

From the perspective of benefits alone, the importance of a direct descendant of the dynasty who had yet to grow was naturally not as important as Black Star, their partner. Although the dynasty’s prestige was damaged this time, and it made Marbruce furious, venting his anger was not something someone in his position should do. Even if the dynasty wanted to, they had to look at the time and the occasion.

Marbruce even felt a little resentful toward Black Star for exposing this secret in front of the federation and the church. Wouldn’t it be better to tell him in private? At most, he would feel embarrassed and not let the other two leaders see him as a joke. It would be better if he dealt with it privately. Before the problem of the World Tree was resolved, the dynasty could not do anything to Black Star. Not only did they have to work together as usual, but after Gaud was returned, they also had to consider the bigger picture and not take revenge for the time being... The more Marbruce thought about it, the more frustrated he felt.

“I just hope that you can give me an acceptable explanation...”

Marbruce exhaled heavily and lowered his standards.

On the other side, the amber holding EsGod was already floating in front of everyone.

Han Xiao glanced at Gaud. Seeing that Gaud was still suppressing the emotions in his heart and maintaining a puzzled expression, he could not help but laugh.

Before his personality split, the real EsGod would not have done this. However, (Esper Ability-Rebirth) had already turned the two of them into independent individuals, and their personalities had changed. Gaud was Gaud, and his main body was his main body. Speaking of which, the ‘new EsGod’ that was currently imprisoned might have a more ‘true EsGod’ personality. “Teny, I’m ready to take action. Activate the space stabilization anchor.” Han Xiao nodded as he spoke out.

Teny turned around and gave the order. The fleets around him quickly surrounded the area and activated the space stabilization anchor to stabilize the area.

EsGod had a lot of abilities, and he was extremely slippery. He could teleport and escape if they were not careful. This was an essential environment modification.

This time, Han Xiao walked out of the cabin alone and slowly arrived in front of the EsGod Amber. Under everyone’s gaze, he unsealed it.

Buzz!

EsGod’s eyes sparkled, and he immediately saw what was going on. He quickly retreated.

It had been decades since the last time he was unsealed, and EsGod’s soul was even more dispirited. However, the wormhole data that Black Star had used to trick him into thinking about the World Tree had already been discovered. Waiting until the day he was released, he had endured the loneliness and struggled to maintain his thinking. Now that he had regained his freedom, he immediately reacted.

However, EsGod was in a very weak state. His wounds that had not healed from the last battle were still hurting, but he still made a defensive stance. His gaze swept across the entire battlefield and quickly locked onto Han Xiao.

“Black Star, I didn’t expect you to let me out again. Looks like I made the right bet.”

To figure out Gaud’s background, Han Xiao had let him out once. EsGod had resisted stubbornly and almost died, but after hearing Black Star’s words, he had decided to surrender and not resist. It seemed like he had won the bet.

“We meet again,” Han Xiao said calmly.

“Is the World Tree here?” EsGod narrowed his eyes and got straight to the point.

“They’re here.” Han Xiao nodded and said calmly, “I let you out this time to fulfill the promise I made back then. I’ll let you witness everything and borrow your strength.”

Hearing this, EsGod seemed to be relieved of a heavy burden and smiled.

“As I said, this day would come sooner or later. You will need my help one day.”

EsGod felt a sense of excitement.

After being locked up for so many years, he had finally made it through!

“I won’t refute you in this aspect. Although you are full of evil, you are still a powerful combatant. It’s too wasteful to lock you up here.” Han Xiao suddenly raised his brows. “However, the way you will help is probably different from what you think.”

“Hmm?”

EsGod was confused. “I don’t intend to let you live. I need to borrow your life. A dead EsGod is a good EsGod.” “...What do you mean? You want to kill me? Now?”

EsGod was stunned.

After sealing me for so long, you only released me to kill me now. What do you want?

This was completely different from what EsGod had expected. In his imagination, when the World Tree descended, the three Universal Civilizations would most likely ask him for help out of courtesy for the information that he had, giving him a chance to turn the situation around.

However, he did not expect that even though he had gotten what he wanted and waited for the day the World Tree descended, his life would also come to an end... He did not think that he would be able to escape from Black Star’s hands in his current weakened state. EsGod had realized this when they fought last time.

He did not know about the existence of the Underworld and did not know what benefits his death would bring to Han Xiao. However, this did not stop him from understanding the other party’s killing intent, and immediately reacted.

EsGod retreated rapidly, squeezing his cells to the limit and pumping out energy. His aura exploded, and a radar alarm sounded. He was prepared to risk his life.

At the same time, a resolute mental wave spread out from EsGod’s body into the minds of everyone present.

“Black Star! I won’t sit back and do nothing. If you want my life, come and get it yourself!” At the same time, Teny, who was watching the battle, shuddered. He secretly told the crew to turn on the video recording device.

“They’re about to start fighting. Remember to record the entire process. Don’t miss out on any of Black Star’s abilities!”

Beside him, Gaud looked at the scene of EsGod getting into his stance, and his emotions were complicated.

This was the first time he had seen his main body after splitting up. It had been almost a hundred years. Seeing his body, which he had once used to conquer the universe, now being controlled by a new personality, the feeling was indescribable.

After all, no matter what, he had always used that body to live in the past, familiarizing himself with every inch. He had spent a lot of effort nurturing the powerful abilities of his main body, but he was forced to leave it to the ‘newbie’. There was both nostalgia and unwillingness.

“If I hadn’t been captured back then, I wouldn’t have abandoned my main body so quickly...”

Gaud gritted his teeth.

Now that the ability of this new body had been taken away, the original body that was left behind became the only hope in his eyes.

Looking at the scene of Black Star confronting his main body outside the window, Gaud’s thoughts raced.

“With the ability of my main body, as long as he can last for some time, he will be able to break through the space stabilization and use Dimensional Hyperdrive to escape... There is still a chance!”

Although he had been locked up for decades and did not understand Black Star’s progress, Gaud was very clear about the strength of his main body. With Black Star’s strength when he defeated him, he felt that he would not be able to take down his main body anytime soon...

This was hope!

Gaud was energized.

However, just as he was about to focus on watching this fierce battle, the sudden change in the situation shocked him!

A circle of golden lightning spread out from Han Xiao’s body, and countless mechanical soldiers surged out. It was as though Han Xiao had become the gate of the secondary dimensional army box, completely ignoring the effects of the Space Stabilization Anchor!

(Godly Stronghold)

In the blink of an eye, the mechanical army far larger than the fleet present had arrived.

The next moment, a large number of machines gathered on Han Xiao’s body, quickly forming a Mechanical Deity with a strange appearance. Its structure was extremely complicated, as though it was covered in a dark gold armor. It had a crown on its head, and its facial features were similar to Han Xiao’s. Complicated silver-blue matrix patterns covered its entire body, flickering as if it was breathing.

Compared to the average Mechanical Deity, the energy fluctuations emitted by this group of machines were even more astonishing. They had a unique temperament and looked like they were one entity. They did not look like something that was synthesized but more like an independent being summoned.

(Mechanical Deity – Supreme Heavenly Venerate]!

A strong, mighty pressure suddenly swept out. Every life form present felt a huge pressure as if a true god had descended.

Teny and the others were not Beyond Grade As, so it was normal. However, EsGod and Gaud’s expressions changed drastically!

“Could it be that you’ve already...”

EsGod was stunned and horrified.

Why had he been moving around in the universe for so many years? It was all to step into a higher realm!

But now, without any mental preparation, he saw something that he had been dreaming of in Black Star. How could he not be shocked?

Without waiting for EsGod to recover from his shock, Han Xiao attacked. The shadow of the Emperor Skysplitter Blade quickly formed in the hands of the Supreme Heavenly Venerate. The next moment, the shadow materialized and slashed.

A suffocating thick psionic energy burst out, turning the visible area blue. Translucent energy engulfed all directions!

EsGod suddenly came back to his senses and hurriedly responded. Layers of energy shields shot out, but under the attack of the Supreme Heavenly Venerate, they shattered and exploded into fragments of light like fragile glass.

He wanted to dodge, but he felt that he was firmly locked onto and could not dodge. Due to the interference of the Space Stabilization Anchor, he could not teleport as well.

EsGod clenched his teeth and gathered what little energy he had left, activating his Esper Ability to fight head-on!

A black and red beam shot out and hit the edge of the Emperor Skysplitter Blade, but was split in half. The blade only paused for an instant before slashing down at an even faster speed. The light from the Getta Hadoken-flowed, compressed, and condensed on the blade – forming a huge light blade.

Bang!

A large blob of flesh and blood mixed with energy exploded, turning into ash halfway through.

EsGod’s body was sent flying, and half of his body was shattered!

The last time EsGod was sealed, he had just been beaten up by Han Xiao. His health was already low to begin with, and the power of this slash heavily injured him. EsGod would have been killed instantly had he not hurriedly activated recovery Esper Ability!

Before he could even adjust his state, Han Xiao struck the air, creating a blue shockwave that quickly caught up to EsGod and swept toward him.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

A series of explosions occurred on EsGod’s body. It was as if he had received tens of thousands of heavy blows at the same time. His body was covered in dense depressions, and he was almost beaten into a lump of flesh, unable to move at all.

EsGod still had a breath of life left, and he frantically activated his Esper Ability to recover. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

However, at this moment, the thrusters on the back of the Supreme Heavenly Venerate spat out thick flames, and the explosion increased its speed. With a turn of the blade, a dazzling slash appeared. The gigantic body was unbelievably agile, and it brushed past EsGod!

Swish!

As the light streaked past EsGod’s body, his recovery stopped, and his life force disappeared at a speed visible to the naked eye.

He controlled his newly grown head with great difficulty and turned to look at the Supreme Heavenly Venerate. Complicated emotions flashed through his eyes. There was enlightenment, envy, relief...

“You didn’t disappoint me... You’ve indeed stepped into... the level of my dreams. At least before I die... I was able to see a higher level of power... It was worth it...”

The intermittent mental fluctuations drained the last of his energy. The next moment, EsGod’s body dissipated in front of everyone’s eyes, turning into starlight and disappearing.

With three auto-attacks, EsGod died!

Teny’s expression froze, and his eyes widened in disbelief.

Black Star had killed a Beyond Grade A in an instant before as well, but that was only due to tactics. Most of the time, he would use the method of mutual destruction, and this seemed to be the first time he had done something like instant-killing a peak Beyond Grade A head-on with auto attacks!

It was as easy as a Beyond Grade A fighting a Calamity Grade Super. This was the Transcendent Grade ?

It was impossible to gather much intelligence on Black Star’s abilities with just two or three moves, but the tip of the iceberg was already shocking enough.

Teny could not help but swallow a mouthful of saliva. He deeply doubted whether an individual strength at this level was something that a fleet could deal with...

“What...”

Gaud was also stunned.

He had thought that Black Star would have a fierce battle with his main body, but he did not expect Black Star to kill his main body so easily in the blink of an eye.

What shocked him the most was the fact that Black Star had already stepped into a higher realm!

A deep sense of powerlessness penetrated Gaud’s body.

He had wasted so many years, committed countless evil deeds, abandoned precious things one after another, and even changed his body, yet he still did not achieve this dream. However, Black Star had easily fulfilled his lifelong wish... How hateful!

Under normal circumstances, Gaud would still have the mentality to chase after his goal, but now that his ability was taken away and his main body was beaten to death, he did not have any more chances. For a moment, he felt as if his heart was dead. He felt that all his essence, energy, and spirit had been sucked away, leaving only an empty shell without a soul.

Gaud would rather be locked in the Spacetime Amber forever than experience this series of despairing blows.

At this moment, he had fallen into a negative state of mind.
