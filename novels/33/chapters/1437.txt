Chapter 1438 Come on, Big Brother who plays with tree roots!

The Pugilist flames burned, and the Tree God’s movements became even faster. His strength increased tremendously, and he suddenly grabbed the Emperor Skysplitter Blade coming at him. He stopped the momentum of the blade in midair.

At the same time, roots shot out from the surface of the Tree God’s body. The ends of the roots curled up like a knot, forming thousands of fists that rained down on the body of the Supreme Heavenly Venerate.

Green fist shadows filled the sky, piercing through the combined shield of the mechanical army and bombarding the body of the Supreme Heavenly Venerate. Cracks appeared on the surface of its body.

Energy shot out from the back of the Supreme Heavenly Venerate one after another, forming a green shockwave that did not weaken in the slightest even after passing through it, destroying patches of battleships as collateral damage.

“His close combat ability has increased tremendously. This should be a sacrifice for the Tree King Crown, right?”

Han Xiao endured the impact and analyzed calmly. He had seen the (Tree Crown-Liberation] skill when he was extracting the Tree God’s ability. The Tree God did not use this skill the last time they fought. This time, he recognized it at a glance.

Seeing the actual effect, Han Xiao felt a sense of familiarity. He felt that this move was a bit like a Character Summon Card, used to obtain the Super system power stored in the different Tree King Crowns. “The World Tree has a total of five... Oh, no, it’s now four Tree King Crowns, which means that the Tree God can spawn at least four more times. Its strength will continue to stack, and its final battle strength will probably be very astonishing. Furthermore, this doesn’t even take into consideration if the Tree God has other explosive abilities.”

Han Xiao quickly calculated.

The moment the Tree God used his one-time explosive ability, the best way to counter it would be to avoid it, but the situation did not allow it. The Multi-Dimensional Sky Opening Transportation Device was one-way, and if he wanted to send a large group back, he would have to set up a new group of teleportation devices here. Now that the majority were already locked in battle with the World Tree, they naturally would not retreat halfway, or many warriors would have died for nothing.

Furthermore, Han Xiao also wanted to fight the Tree God head-on. After all, with his current strength, it was difficult to find an opponent. Now that he had finally met one, how could he not show the other party some love?

“Looks like I have to show you my true skills. Let me see how many tricks you have.”

Han Xiao’s eyes sparkled.

He had long known that the Tree God had an explosive ability, but the Ancestral Tree King thought that he did not know and wanted to give him an unexpected attack. However, he had long been prepared for it.

On the other side, the Ancestral Tree King held onto the Emperor Skysplitter Blade tightly, not allowing Han Xiao’s weapon to escape his control. Endless energy flowed out from his body, and he was able to gain the upper hand against the Supreme Heavenly Venerate, pushing Han Xiao back.

Taking advantage of the fact that Han Xiao could not move, the Ancestral Tree King controlled a large number of roots and attacked the chest of the Supreme Heavenly Venerate.

The mechanical army also reacted and began to block the attacks of the Tree God. At the same time, the mechanical particles flowing around the body of the Supreme Heavenly Venerate also transformed into streams, intercepting the roots halfway.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Looking from afar, countless blurry afterimages of light appeared around the two super gods and collided with each other. Metal and tree roots clashed at a high frequency, and continuous shockwaves exploded in midair.

“Your strength is already below mine!”

The Ancestral Tree King had a vicious expression on his face. He twisted the Emperor Skysplitter Blade as he channeled his energy into his arm. He was about to launch a follow-up attack.

However, at this moment, an irresistible force suddenly came from the blade and suppressed his strength!

Boom!

The next moment, the Emperor Skysplitter Blade, which was originally frozen in midair, suddenly broke through the Tree God’s stance and slashed down. In an instant, it slashed across the Tree God’s shoulder all the way to his waist, leaving a huge wound. The Tree God was almost cut into two.

“What?!”

The Ancestral Tree King was horrified. Instead of retreating, he rushed forward and hugged Han Xiao. He wanted to use the power of the crown to restrict Han Xiao’s movement and stop his follow-up attack.

However, the result was far from what he had imagined. The Tree God was crushed under the body of the Supreme Heavenly Venerate and almost dismembered as though he was suffering from the capital punishment of ‘Death by a Thousand Cuts’. The power brought by the sacrifice of the Pugilist Tree King Crown was still suppressed by Han Xiao! The Ancestral Tree King was horrified. He had barely escaped by igniting the Pugilist flames, but the body of the Tree God was already in tatters. Countless pieces of its newly born flesh had been cut off, and it was currently in the process of recovery.

Han Xiao casually cut off the World Tree Root that he was following before looking at the Tree God with dissatisfaction.

“You’re so arrogant at only this standard?”

“You...”

Feeling Han Xiao’s energy level rising, the Ancestral Tree King’s expression darkened.

He had thought that he would be able to gain the upper hand after liberating the Tree King Crown, but reality had given him a huge slap. He did not expect that he would still not be Han Xiao’s match after using his burst ability, and the other party was also increasing their combat capability. The Ancestral Tree King clenched his teeth before making a decision.

“Don’t celebrate too early. I haven’t reached my limit!”

The moment he said that the crown of the Secret Tree King shattered!

A new source of energy was released. It was like adding fuel to the core furnace of the Tree God. Its energy level broke through its limits once again! Countless magical knowledge flowed into his brain. At the same time, many complicated magic circuits appeared on the surface of the Tree God’s body, forming various enchantment runes.

In an instant, the power of the mages was also applied to the Tree God!

The Tree God Domain expanded once again, almost flattening the Void Domain! “Ahhh,”

An even stronger burden descended, and the mental strength of the Ancestral Tree King soared. However, at the same time, it brought him even more intense pain. His soul wailed uncontrollably, and his emotions became even more intense.

He endured the pain, mobilized his new strength, and launched an even stronger attack at Han Xiao.

Boom!

The surging magic power formed a densely packed Forbidden Technique that almost drained all the free energy particles in the nearby battlefield. It turned into bright rainbow light and submerged Han Xiao’s entire body. It was extremely deadly.

As the Tree God maintained the bombardment of magic, he charged into the light of the explosion and chased after the body of the Supreme Heavenly Venerate. The fists and roots that contained the shocking Pugilist flames landed on Han Xiao’s body continuously, creating loud explosions! The Ancestral Tree King stared with bloodshot eyes, tirelessly attacking again and again!

“Black Star! I will never let you destroy my civilization!”

The mental shockwave of the roar swept across the battlefield, instantly stirring the emotions of countless people!

However, right at this moment, an extremely dense aura of blood suddenly erupted in front of him.

Buzz!

Before the Ancestral Tree King could react, a cold light suddenly lit up. He felt a huge force coming from his chest. The Emperor Skysplitter Blade flew over and stabbed into his chest.

The next second, the Ancestral Tree King realized that his arm was firmly locked in place. Not only that, but all the roots that he was using to attack had also stopped moving.

The light of the magic explosion dissipated, revealing the appearance of the Supreme Celestial Venerable. Han Xiao’s entire body was covered in blood energy, and he grabbed the arm of the Tree God. The mechanical particles formed countless tentacles that extended out from his back, accurately wrapping around the roots of every World Tree. They were joined in midair like bridges.

The power of the Supreme Heavenly Venerate increased rapidly, and it soon exceeded the second stage liberated Tree God, making it impossible for the Ancestral Tree King to escape.

“You...”

The Ancestral Tree King’s eyes widened.

However, before he could do anything, Han Xiao suddenly smashed his head against him.

The next moment, the Supreme Heavenly Venerate grabbed the Tree God’s arm and pressed him down. At the same time, he bent his knee and raised his leg, smashing the Tree God’s head with a powerful knee strike, producing a green shockwave. Han Xiao extended his hand and stabbed into the hole on the Tree God’s head, all the way to his chest. He grabbed a bunch of messy roots and pulled them out, tearing out a large number of broken roots.

If it had been a normal life form, its spine and organs would have been pulled out. Even the Tree God, who had a special body structure, would not have felt good.

At this time, Han Xiao pulled out the Emperor Skysplitter Blade from the Tree God’s chest. He then used Virtual Creation to create countless huge cannons around the tree god.

Hong Long LongAfter a round of firing, countless physical bullets of planetary-sized mass blasted the Tree God into smithereens.

The terrifying kinetic energy pushed the Tree God and sent him flying, creating a blank space on the battlefield. Han Xiao followed closely behind and entered the middle of the third layer of defense.

Only then did the Ancestral Tree King manage to stop his uncontrolled retreat and teleport to avoid Han Xiao’s pursuit. He jumped a distance away and quickly summoned more World Tree Roots to heal his injuries.

Seeing this, Han Xiao swung his blade and said casually, “That’s it? Anything else?”

In terms of the quantity and quality of the attribute enhancement abilities, there were very few people who could beat him. The Tree God had buffed itself twice in a row, and his combat strength had increased by quite a lot, but it was still insufficient in front of him.

Although he had just stepped into the Transcendent Grade not too long ago, as long as he activated all the bonuses, his combat strength would increase to an astonishing level. Han Xiao was not sure what level he would be at after he unleashed his full strength.

Hearing this, the Ancestral Tree King became even more agitated. Anger, shock, and unwillingness filled his mind. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Even after sacrificing two Tree King Crowns and paying such a huge price, his combat capability was still no match for Black Star?!

The Ancestral Tree King was already caught between a rock and a hard place. To him, a stalemate was meaningless. If he could not kill Black Star, Black Star would be able to make a comeback countless times. There was only one path left, and that was to kill Black Star at all costs.

Various thoughts flashed through his mind. The Ancestral Tree King looked at the main body of the mother tree with determination.

Seeing that the Ancestral Tree King did not reply, Han Xiao was about to continue attacking, but at this moment, the World Tree fleet charged toward him as though they were insane.

“Protect the mother tree!”

“Go, give the Tree God some time to breathe!”

“Fight for our homeland!”

Countless World Tree warriors rushed over to engage in a fierce battle.

Seeing this, Han Xiao casually attacked, only to see the new troops constantly approaching to replenish those wiped out. Many World Tree soldiers were willing to die, using their lives to form a line of defense to stop him from chasing after the Tree God, just to give the heavily damaged Tree God more time to recover. However, in the face of the absolute difference in strength, the determination to face death was meaningless. No matter how many fleets there were, they would all be destroyed by the psionic waves.

Countless members of the World Tree Blessed Race swarmed over like moths to a flame, leaving behind a bunch of paralyzed battleship wreckages. There was only dead silence in the ship, as the crew had all died under the psionic waves.

Han Xiao was hardly obstructed at all. He stepped on the debris of the countless World Tree battleships and pointed at the heavily injured Tree God. The gigantic figure of the Supreme Heavenly Venerate gave off an aura of despair to his enemies.

Seeing this tragic scene, many players who were fighting were moved.

“They should be evenly matched, but why do I feel like it’s an adult bullying a child...”

“Look at Black Star’s style, I’m a little confused. Which one is the real villain boss?”

“Come on, big brother who plays with tree roots!”

Amidst the cheers of the players, Han Xiao slammed into the Tree God, who had yet to fully recover, and pushed him as he shot forward.

The Tree God seemed to have lost its ability to resist and could not stop Han Xiao at all. The two of them surrounded each other and broke through the third and fourth layers of defense. Not long after, they reached the fifth layer of defense. The World Tree’s main body that supported this dimension was now right in front of them.

The eyes of the Galactic Alliance Army and the World Tree fleet all focused on Black Star. Seeing that Black Star was approaching the World Tree’s main body, everyone’s hearts were in their throats.

However, right at this moment, the Tree God’s green domain suddenly expanded.

Buzz!

The green light exploded and enveloped the two of them. It then shrank into a light spot and disappeared. The two of them were swallowed up and disappeared from the battlefield under the eyes of everyone.

This scene was out of the Galactic Alliance Army’s expectations. Countless people’s hearts suddenly constricted, and they did not know what had happened.

At the same time, in the Strategic Command of the Allied Army.

Simon rushed to the table, his eyes wide with shock.

“Where’s Black Star? Where the f**k did the two of them go?!!”
