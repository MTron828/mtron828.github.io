Chapter 1427 Wuornos’ Sensation

In the shallow layer dimensional base.

Han Xiao turned off the communicator and deactivated the remote projection. He rubbed his forehead and closed his eyes for a while before opening them again. “The Super Star Cluster has reached a consensus that they will not cause any trouble for the time being.”

Han Xiao heaved a sigh of relief.

He tried to reason with them, analyzed the situation for them, threatened them, and tempted them. In the end, he finally managed to persuade them back.

Of course, this was only a temporary consensus. The Super Star Cluster Alliance did not agree to give up on migrating and was only willing to stay and watch, and increase the support for a while longer. However, this was enough. If the Super Star Cluster Alliance did not give him face and ran away, even if he could make the Super Star Cluster Alliance pay the price afterward, he would not be able to stop the negative chain reaction in the war.

Currently, the armed forces of the explored universe were not lacking, and the internal division had temporarily disappeared before it even started. The Super Star Cluster Alliance would not become a ‘traitor’ for the time being

Damn it, the galactic society is indeed carried by me!

Han Xiao shook his head. He opened the real-time military star map of the explored universe, and areas appeared in front of him, blue in color. Inside the various Star Fields, green spots were appearing, expanding at an extremely slow speed. This represented the invasion range of the World Tree.

“The World Tree has great momentum, but the territory of the three Universal Civilizations is too large, and even if the World Tree blossoms more, its invasion will still be slow. Although the battle is intense, the threat in the short term is still low.”

Han Xiao analyzed.

A sudden change in the situation would more or less affect the mentality. The three Universal Civilizations were a little flustered when dealing with this, but Han Xiao still maintained his calm. He ignored the anxiety of the territories being continuously devoured and calmly judged the situation. After all, he had seen worse situations in his previous life, so this small situation could not scare him.

No matter how strong the World Tree was, it had to be eating slowly. It couldn’t become fat in one bite. Furthermore, the resistance of the Galactic Alliance Army made it very difficult for it to ‘feed’.

In comparison, Han Xiao felt that the biggest effect of the World Tree’s full invasion was firstly a blow to the people and morale of the galactic society, and secondly, it affected their resource production and productivity.

According to the information that was leaked, as well as his experience from his previous life, Han Xiao could guess the World Tree’s priority targets. The military factories and resource planets of the various organizations were definitely the first choices, which would reduce the speed of the three Universal Civilizations’ troops mobilization.

Second would be the mother planets of some Star System or Star Cluster civilizations, governance planets, and refuge planets with large populations. This way, they could cause panic and internal chaos in the galactic society. The World Tree had invaded many civilizations, so it was clear about this trick.

Then, there were the important bases of some Beyond Grade A races and private organizations. Destroying them would cut off the wings of the three Universal Civilizations.

Of course, as the core of the galactic society, the Central Galaxy was the most important target. However, Han Xiao guessed that the World Tree would most likely not attack it for the time being because the Central Galaxy would be heavily guarded. Once they invaded, a large group battle would break out, similar to the border war.

The World Tree now had many space coordinates, and with such an advantage, it should not be willing to continue fighting with the low-efficiency frontal attack method. Instead, it chose to strike the weakest areas and focus on continuous harassment, displaying its high mobility and advantage in sustaining war with war.

“These are all areas that need to be protected. After this battle, I wonder how many more desolate universe belts there will be... It’s a pity that the World Tree’s mechanism is too perverse. Otherwise, I could have given it a taste of its own medicine.’

Han Xiao was a little helpless.

With his individual strength, he could go to the World Tree territory and make a scene. However, more than ten years ago, he had learned a lot of information from the foreign experts of the World Tree. The World Tree’s base could be retracted into its body at any time, and it could pack up and run away. There was not much use in harassing them as they could just move to another place. This would not affect the enemy’s productivity much, because the World Tree itself was the largest military factory. It could directly convert resources inside, and there was no need to build countless factories like normal civilizations. Otherwise, Han Xiao would not think that it was a complementing target to (Virtual Creation (Pseudo)]. Furthermore, the Blessed Races of the World Tree were eyeing the Pivotal Snake. Han Xiao did not want to leave the shallow layer dimensions. Even if he had to reinforce the main universe, he would only send out a portion of the Mechanical Oracles. His main body would remain in the secondary dimensions to guard his ‘home’.

The World Tree was not willing to sit back and do nothing. Apart from invading the territory of the three Universal Civilizations, it would not give up on killing the Pivotal Snake. He did not know what the other party’s plan was, so he had to be careful. “However, although it’s not very useful, it’s not bad to be able to give them trouble. With my current strength, I don’t have to worry about being besieged on a large scale as I did in the past. Wouldn’t it be even greater if they get agitated and fight me head-on?” Han Xiao felt that it was worth a try.

Arcane Church, Temple of Ten Thousand Gods.

Wuornos walked slowly in the corridor formed by tall God sculptures of different shapes and sizes, holding a ball of spiritual light in his hand. Every time he walked in front of a God sculpture, he would use the corresponding simple ceremony to perform a ritual that was neither too fast nor too slow. He then flicked the spiritual light into the body of the statue, looking like he was feeding his pets or spreading bait to the fishes. This was his daily ritual. Usually, he was alone, but today, there was a bunch of ‘tails’ behind him. A group of senior members of the Arcane Church, who were wearing priest robes and officer uniforms, followed behind him. “High Priest, now that the World Tree has invaded, our high-level combatants are not enough. I hope you can help.” “Aren’t you afraid that I’ll die on the battlefield and drop the National Treasure?” Wuornos said casually without looking back.

“Of course, we don’t wish to take the risk. When the border wars occurred and secondary dimensions were invaded, we did not request you to take action. It’s just that the situation is urgent this time, and we need you to use some of the incarnations to help...” an officer said softly.

This was a very normal request. In the past, Wuornos would have agreed to it, but now, he was different.

“I refuse.” Wuornos shook his head.

“This... why?”

“I’m only one step away from the Transcendent Grade, and I can obtain the opportunity to advance at any time. I need to maintain my peak state at all times to prevent myself from missing the opportunity. As long as the enemies don’t attack the Arcane Church’s mother planet, don’t look at me for anything else. I don’t want to waste my energy elsewhere,” Wuornos said casually.

“But the other direct descendants are all fighting a bloody battle. Isn’t your refusal a little...”

“You don’t understand. Whether or not I can advance to the Transcendent Grade is more important than these battles. This is the independence granted to me by the Pope. I have the right to decide if I want to participate in the battle.” Wuornos waved his hand casually. “Stop pestering me here. Go back.”

The group of people looked at each other, clenched their teeth, and left with dissatisfaction.

Wuornos did not care.

His last advancement had failed, causing him to be heavily injured. However, there was also an unexpected benefit, which was that the Pope saw that he indeed had the possibility of advancing at any time, so he simply allowed him to decide when he wanted to join the battle.

Therefore, over the past ten years, Wuornos did not participate in the war, nor did he attempt to advance rashly. He had been recuperating and reflecting on why he had failed.

Wuornos always felt that he was missing some key elements. It was not as if he had gained nothing after searching for so long. He had vaguely discovered the mysterious ability hidden in his body, but it had yet to be fully activated. It seemed to be able to sense something unknown, and his intuition told him that this feeling was very important for Promotion.

“When I figure out what’s going on, I should be able to step into the Transcendent Grade. Maybe this is the secret of Black Star’s Promotion. I won’t fail again this time...”

Wuornos’ eyes flashed.

Somewhere in the Endless Nebulae, two fleets were engaged in an intense battle. One side was the World Tree invaders, and the other was the Black Star Army.

A large number of charge cabins latched onto the spaceships of the World Tree and sent out batches of army players to board the battleships. The World Tree battleships fell one after another from the inside. Many Calamity Grade players wore mechanical suits and swam around the battlefield.

Due to the sudden change in the situation, the combat missions of the players had also changed. From guarding the borders, they had gone to different areas to stop the World Tree invaders. The mission format was much more varied.

The border defense circle of the Flickering World almost transformed into a teleportation station, and the Multi-Dimensional Sky Opening Transportation Device operated continuously, sending batches of players to the various Star Fields.

The new level cap was unlocked in Version 5.5, and many players had just entered the Calamity Grade. A Calamity Grade that did not fear death naturally could not be underestimated. Furthermore, there was a large group of them. Although there were many Calamity Grade Supers on the World Tree’s side, they were not as expendable as the players.

Everyone could revive, but the time interval between the revivals of the World Tree was longer, and the dead warriors appeared in the mother tree’s body. They could not be revived on the spot like the players, and their effectiveness could not be compared at all. It was equivalent to the players’ real strength being many times stronger than on the surface; one player was equal to many. There were Immortals on both sides, and the battle was extremely intense. However, it was clear who was stronger, and the World Tree warriors were forced to retreat.

“This group of Immortals is too terrifying. With so many Calamity Grades as a suicide squad, only the main elites can fight them. We can’t hold on at all.”

Inside this invading main ship of the World Tree, the commander was surprised.

Ever since the World Tree obtained the intelligence of the three Universal Civilizations, this information had been shared in the mental network. From the Tree King to the grassroots soldiers, they all understood the Super classification of the three Universal Civilizations, as well as the Immortals and other strange existences.

“There seems to be a limit to the revival of these Immortals. If we kill them multiple times in a short period, they won’t be able to revive for some time,” the aide-de-camp said.

The commander murmured, “I wonder what kind of existence this is. What kind of power did their revival come from...”

The aide-de-camp shrugged and said, “Maybe they have a World Tree too? Who knows?”

A few days later, somewhere in the World Tree territory. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

A wormhole slowly opened, and a mechanical body came out. It was Han Xiao’s Lord’s Avatar.

Han Xiao twisted his neck and activated the self-inspection device. The outer armor opened and closed like scales, revealing fine cracks. He felt the exquisite feeling of the mechanical body and let out a comfortable groan. Due to the (Energy Base-God of All Machines), the Transcendent Grade Lord’s Descent had improved in perception aspect. With the Lord’s Descent of a Beyond Grade A, there was still a barrier between his senses and the Lord’s Avatar body. Although he could control it like his arm, he could clearly tell that it was not his body.

But at the Transcendent Grade, the feeling of the Lord’s Avatar was almost the same as the main body. It was not like a mechanical avatar but more like a main body. The control was fine and smooth.

If an example was to be given, a Beyond Grade A’s Lord’s Descent was like the remote control of a virtual reality. It was very real, but deep down, he knew it was fake. The feeling of a Transcendent Grade’s Lord’s Descent was like he had been reborn...

“This feels good. The avatar’s power capacity has reached more than 94%. Not bad.” Han Xiao clenched his fists. He could feel the rhythm of every alloy, every part, and every biochemical tendon in his body. He nodded with satisfaction, then looked up at the sky full of stars in the World Tree territory.

“More than ten years ago, I was heavily injured by you guys and almost died in your base camp. Now is the time to settle the score!”
