Chapter 699 This Leek Is Bleeding Internally

Since the Hutt superiors rejected him, he had no need to stay at the prison. Han Xiao expressed his intent to leave. Wolman asked him to stay longer for a few times but stopped at a suitable point. They took the hovering car back and headed to the dock.

The atmosphere in the car was silent; no one talked. Han Xiao closed his eyes and rested. Reynold sat at the side, wanting to speak but did not.

Wolman secretly looked at Han Xiao’s expression. He felt that Black Star was definitely unhappy since he had been rejected. However, he did not care about Black Star’s feelings. After all, all he did was convey the message from the upper echelons. If Black Star was unhappy about that, it would have nothing to do with him.

Furthermore, Wolman did not think that making Black Star unhappy was a big deal at all. Civilizations controlled the universe; no matter how strong Black Star was, he was not part of a government.

As a diplomat, he felt that he figured out what the superiors meant—the Hutt Civilization had no intention of wooing Black Star. Purple Crystal was already way ahead of them, and they had no chance to compete with a Star Cluster civilization.

So many Star System civilizations wanted to befriend Black Star, and they were just one of them. Godora had the closest relationship with Black Star among the Star System civilizations, while the Hutt Civilization was Godora’s competitor. No matter how they looked at it, Black Star would definitely not establish a close relationship with the Hutt Civilization.

Therefore, Wolman felt that the upper echelons knew that they did not have a chance, so they did not want to waste efforts wooing Black Star. They would not be able to get anything in return for Rossellin anyway, so why should they lower their heads and fulfil Black Star’s request? Like other Star System civilizations, they just had to give enough face to Black Star and treat the Black Star Army’s subdivision as a tie for a shallow relationship. That was all.

In Wolman’s eyes, Black Star wanting to take someone from him with just one sentence was a clear act of overconfidence.

Us Star System civilizations will indeed give you face, but we will not obey your every demand.

As Wolman was deducing the intention of his superiors, the hovering car finally arrived at the dock.

Han Xiao and Reynold got out of the car and boarded their spaceship with Wolman escorting them up.

Han Xiao stepped onto the gangway and was about to walk into the hatch. He suddenly turned around and looked at Wolman, who was standing on the dock.

“We will meet again very soon.”

“We look forward to your next visit.” Wolman had a sincere-looking but fake smile on his face.

The spaceship shook and quickly started. It followed the dock tunnel, turned into a high-speed stream of light, and disappeared.

As the spaceship left far away, Wolman wiped the smile from his face, pressed his stiff facial muscles, and turned around to wave at his team members.

“Let’s go.”

Five days passed peacefully.

On this day, the delicate Wolman was spending his days in the Skywalker Star System Black Star Army subdivision as always when an urgent notification was sent to his email. A team from the Foreign Affairs Department was about to come to the Black Star Army’s subdivision. The email was to notify him to prepare the welcome.

“Strange, I wasn’t noticed beforehand about this. Why are they suddenly sending people to the Black Star Army subdivision?”

This notice did not follow the regular procedures, nor did it convey the purpose of these Foreign Affairs Department colleagues’ visit. Wolman was confused, but since it was a mission from above, he could only complete it.

Wolman brought along his team members, arranged the welcome, and arrived at the dock of the subdivision, waiting for the arrival of these colleagues.

This Black Star Army sub-base was built to be orbiting on the outer space track of the resource planet in order to monitor the harvesting team on the planet. The dock was a hovering galactic harbor built beside the sub-base. It was an independent space station.

After Wolman waited for more than half an hour, a government spaceship with the Hutt Civilization mark approached and stopped at the dock.

The spaceship stabilized, and the hatch slowly opened. A group of people in diplomat clothing accompanied a few Purple Crystal people down the gangway while chatting and laughing.

Wolman quickly went forward and introduced himself.

“This is the person in charge of the diplomatic matters with the Black Star Army subdivision, Wolman. These are Purple Crystal Civilization’s emissaries. We have just completed a handover task and are planning to rest here for a day,” a diplomat said elegantly.

Purple Crystal Civilization emissaries! Wolman was shocked. Purple Crystal was the ruling civilization of Colton, and Hutt was just a Star System civilization under them. Purple Crystal specifically dispatching emissaries there meant that this was an important diplomatic task.

Wolman could not help but feel jealous of these Foreign Affairs Department colleagues of his who were chatting and laughing with the Purple Crystal emissaries. They had the opportunity to get in contact with the emissaries of Star Cluster civilizations, and they were active in the political stage between civilizations. Their job was more elegant and graceful, while he was made to take care of an armed force.

I will be transferred back sooner or later... Wolman comforted himself. Back when his superiors sent him to be in charge of the Black Star Army subdivision, it was definitely because they believed in his capabilities. A diplomatic elite like him would definitely return to the Foreign Affairs Headquarters in the future.

Just as he was about to invite the Purple Crystal emissaries to stay, a few armed officers escorted someone off the spaceship. Wolman turned to look and was instantly stunned.

The woman escorted there was the person whom he had just met together with Black Star a few days prior, Rossellin!

Wolman was shocked. He nudged one of his colleagues that accompanied the Purple Crystal emissaries and softly asked, “Why is she on your ship? Why did you bring her here?”

“You know her? This is a prisoner the Purple Crystal emissary specifically sent people to take charge of. She’s called Rossellin.”

Wolman immediately thought of Black Star.

Could it be...

At this time, another spaceship landed. Wolman recognized this battleship; it was Black Star’s ride.

The hatch opened, and Han Xiao and Reynold walked down. The Purple Crystal emissaries instantly smiled and approached the two of them.

After chatting for a while with smiles on their faces, the Purple Crystal emissary waved his hand. A few armed personnel escorted Rossellin over to Han Xiao, opened the various constraints, and released her on the spot.

Rossellin rubbed her wrists, glanced at Reynold, and gave Han Xiao a deep look, not saying anything. Reynold then took her up onto the Blacklight Stealth.

Han Xiao turned around and noticed the stunned Wolman who was standing at the edge of the crowd, so he smiled and walked over.

“As I said, we meet again.”

“You...” Wolman suddenly did not know what he should say to deal with this situation.

“It’s actually not that big a deal. Since your Hutt Civilization doesn’t allow bail, I had no choice but to let a civilization that does allow bail take over.” Han Xiao raised his brows.

Wolman’s lips shivered, and he forced out a rigid smile. There were thousands of curses in his heart, but he did not dare say any of them.

From the side of his vision, he saw that his colleagues were smiling brightly as if they had known all along and he was the only one that did not.

At this moment, he felt that his most precious sense of superiority was shattered into pieces, by the Hutt Civilization government who had gifted it to him in the first place.

Han Xiao did not look at him anymore. He turned around and shook hands with the Purple Crystal emissaries, chatted for a while, boarded his spaceship, and left with Rossellin.

Wolman clenched his fists and forced out a smile to face the Purple Crystal emissariesdoing his job was more important.

After finally settling these emissaries down, Wolman returned to the office. He was the only one there.

Sitting in his chair, Wolman exhaled deeply. He wanted to suppress his thoughts and continue to read his book, but he realized that he could not concentrate on it at all.

Every time Wolman thought of Black Star, he felt unpleasant. He comforted himself that this was a matter for the superiors and had nothing to do with him.

There were no conflicts between him and Black Star. Fortunately for him, he had maintained his diplomatic etiquette. No one knew how he had ridiculed him in his mind, and no one would know that he felt embarrassed.

Beep beep!

This time, Wolman’s communicator rang. He opened it, and to his surprise, it was a message from his direct boss.

“His Excellency Black Star specifically told us that he’s very satisfied with your services and that it made him very comfortable. He also hopes to see you again next time. Therefore, your transfer request is temporarily postponed. You will continue to be in charge of the diplomatic tasks with the Black Star Army’s subdivision...”

Clank!

A few team members outside were just about to push open the door when they suddenly heard sounds of someone smashing things coming from the office.

The few of them hastily pushed the door open and saw Wolman’s usually calm face filled with rage. The floor beside his table was in a mess. The crystal cup that he always used was shattered into pieces, scattered around the floor, and the green drink had spilled over the physical books that he had always taken very good care of.

In the Blacklight Stealth’s main hall, three people sat on a circular sofa in a triangle. Rossellin’s eyes kept moving between Han Xiao and Reynold. Reynold was sitting straight and looking directly ahead. Han Xiao leaned back with one hand on the back of the sofa and the other carrying a wine glass, sizing Rossellin up with an interested look on his face.

“What do you want me to do for you for saving me? Come on, don’t be shy, tell me.”

Rossellin broke the silence first.

Reynold frowned. “I just wanted to save you...”

“Enough. Keep those lies for yourself.” Rossellin interrupted Rossellin, crossed her legs, and said with a mocking expression, “I don’t know who this ‘Excellency Black Star’ is. In order to get me out, you guys even contacted Purple Crystal, so the cost is probably quite high. I don’t believe that such a big price paid would just be to fulfil an idiot subordinate’s wish. Hehe, you probably told this Black whatever about my ability... Sorry, your nickname is too stupid. I’m too lazy to say it.”

Is this woman’s zodiac animal hedgehog? Stabbing whoever she wants...

Han Xiao remembered that Rossellin’s personality was not like this during the Silver Revolutionary Army era in his previous life.

Reynold said with a deep voice, “I asked His Excellency Black Star to save you in exchange for myself. Know your place!”

“Oh.” Rossellin curled her lips and raised her tone. “So, you thought I’d be grateful to you?”

“You!” Reynold was exasperated.

“I’m quite curious, what made this Black whatever guy accept this kind of request? Which part of you is so important to him?” Rossellin sized Reynold up.

“I’m a Calamity Grade now!”

“Oh, you’ve grown up, I see.” Rossellin opened her mouth wide with exaggeration before clapping a few times without any signs of being sincere. She shrugged and said, “So, you’re saying that you’re very important to him?”

Reynold could not reply. Han Xiao was right beside him. He could not praise himself and say that he was important to him.

“Ahem.” Han Xiao stopped the conversation between the two of them and said, “Contacting the Purple Crystal Civilization isn’t difficult for me. You’ve been imprisoned for too long, so you’ve never heard of me.”

Without a doubt, he was not going to use force. Even with his current position, if he actually attacked a civilization, he would still receive punishments.

In terms of retrieving the sub-base to express his attitude, it would give him a bad name. The other partner galactic civilizations would feel that he was forcing a government. He was not a Beyond Grade A yet, so he should not be too domineering. That would not be beneficial to maintaining stable partnerships.

Resolving this matter was actually very easy. Since the Hutt Civilization could take Rossellin from Ceciris, the Purple Crystal Civilization could also take her from them. It was just a handover.

Purple Crystal took him much more seriously than Hutt as he was a partner of Purple Crystal. Hutt, however, knowing that they had no chance to compete, were unwilling to woo him, so they did not want to give him face.

However, proving their loyalty to Purple Crystal was so much more beneficial. Therefore, when Purple Crystal took over the matter, the Hutt Civilization immediately agreed. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Efficient and effective, this was Han Xiao’s solution. If a player had to do this mission, they would basically have to break into the prison by force.

“I see, you seem to be someone very important.” Rossellin raised her brows. “It looks like I need to study the history of the past decade or so.”

Rossellin stood up and came before Han Xiao. She snatched his wine class and gulped it down. Then, she casually threw the empty cup away. She sat back down, burped, waved her hands, and said, “I’m thirsty, so I drank some. For such an important person like you, I’m sure you won’t mind.”

Han Xiao turned to look at Reynold. “Your sister has quite an interesting personality, like a rascal.”

“Ever since she was little, she has been willful, caustic, and mean, never considering the feeling of the others!” Reynold could not hold back anymore and started to complain. “Therefore, when she became a careerist that toyed with an entire civilization, I wasn’t even surprised!”

“That’s right, I’m a careerist, a caustic rascal. Countless people are going to suffer now that you’ve let me out. Are you regretting saving me, my dear little brother?” Rossellin made a funny face.

“No.” Reynold disdained quarreling with her.

“Tsk, I’m a little touched. It’s really true that no matter how you hurt your family, your family will still be willing to be taken advantage of.” Rossellin stretched lazily. “Since you guys aren’t going to make use of me, does that mean I can leave anytime I want? If you reject, it means you are planning to use me. Of course, you don’t have to be shameful about your hypocrisy; I’ve seen this kind of thing way too many times.”

Reynold turned to Han Xiao. He only wanted to save Rossellin. As for where Rossellin would go in the future, he did not want to care about it at all. Han Xiao was the one that could make the decision to let her go.

Han Xiao caressed his chin and suddenly said, “You built a new religion in your hometown and brainwashed countless people, making them worship you. Anyone would think you’re a careerist.”

“Hmm, you have such sharp eyes, just like every normal person in the world, and you like to repeat obvious things.” Rossellin’s face was filled with mockery. “What, are you planning to judge my actions? Tell me then, I will try my absolute very best to repent for one minute.”

“I don’t think you’re a careerist; you’re a reformer.” Han Xiao leaned forward and stared into Rossellin’s eyes, speaking with a calm and normal tone.

The moment he spoke, Rossellin’s expression stiffened, and a tint of anxiety flashed through her eyes. She was stunned.
