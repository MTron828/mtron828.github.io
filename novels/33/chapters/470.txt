Chapter 471: Shattered Light (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

After becoming a War Mechanic, Han Xiao had five new abilities on his interface. Even without looking at them, he was familiar with the effects of these abilities.

[Application Level Machinery Affinity] had more Machinery Affinity bonus than [Advanced Machinery Affinity]. It was the core of the Mechanic class, so he definitely had to level it up. Since he only had 300 million experience left, he only leveled it up to LV5. Every level gave five percent Machinery Affinity, so his Machinery Affinity increased by another twenty-five percent.

[Waste Modification]’s prerequisite was one of the three abilities from the compression technology, [Basic Machinery Construction]. Their effects were somewhat similar. [Waste Modification]’s effect was if a machine was destroyed and became a pile of scrap parts, this ability could recover these parts and turn them into the original machinery. Of course, the machinery would have a twenty-five percent decrease in attributes and be one or two grades lower. Also, this ability could be used multiple times on the same target until the target’s grade reached Gray or had a seventy-five percent decrease in attributes. This meant that this ability could be used a maximum of three times on the same target.

As the name suggested, this ability was a highly efficient waste recycling ability. Its effect was much stronger in actual battle than stated in the introduction. Furthermore, it was one of the reasons that the War Mechanic class had a ‘War’ prefix. It gave Mechanics many more tactical choices. In Han Xiao’s previous life, only when the players reached their fifth and sixth main class level in Version 3.0 did the Mechanics first showcase their strength. The War Mechanic class was very complex and hard to master; its combos were difficult to use, and it required a very strong tactical mindset. The War Mechanic class was the most difficult class to operate among the five classes.

[Mechanical Force Overload] was a normal boosting ability, similar to [Surging Mechanical Force] and [Overload] but with higher numbers. The difference between them was that [Surging Mechanical Force] had no side effect, [Overload] decreased the machinery’s durability, and [Mechanical Force Overload] would cause the machinery to enter a cooldown where they could not be used. It was not a very impactful ability. However, when it was used together with [Overload] on the same machine, the enhancement would increase by another forty percent, and the durability would decrease by thirty-three percent immediately. Han Xiao had used this ability a lot in the past, but he had only used it on the machinery that he was willing to sacrifice.

The most special ability was [Mechanical Force Combat Technique], which was still ‘Locked’ till the High-End Knowledge [Advanced Electromagnetic Forcefield] was learned. What was special about this ability was that it was not an ability that enhanced the machinery but the Mechanic themself.

The Mechanical Force was transformed from Electromagnetic Energy, so it was also electromagnetic. This ability allowed the Mechanics to still be able to fight even without machinery, just like how every Mage had a certain amount of melee battle capability.

The talent [Battlefield Wisdom] was a fixed talent of the Mechanic class. After entering battle, this talent would provide an additional one percent Intelligence every minute until it reached a maximum of fifteen percent. Together with the talent unlocked in the previous main class stage [Machinery Analytical Comprehension] that provided one percent Machinery Affinity for every ten Intelligence, it allowed Mechanics to become stronger as their level increased.

During battles between players, a Mechanic’s machinery continuously weaken over the course of a battle, and this talent filled the shortcomings of the Mechanics’ capability in long battles. When the Mechanic class was fully shaped, it would become very comprehensive in all kinds of battles. One of the basic tactics used by Mechanics was to stall for fifteen minutes with mechanic traps till they gained the maximum bonus, then released all the machinery to deal explosive damage... also known as the Bladder Tactic.

Han Xiao only increased the Machinery Affinity abilities by a few levels and did not touch anything else, spending about 40 million experience. He was left with about 250 million experience, which he planned to save and spend slowly. He then spent the ninety-six Free Attribute Points on his interface all in Intelligence as usual.

Although he hesitated for a split second when he saw the number ‘1’ on his Luck attribute, he did not spend any of it on Luck. Even though his Luck attribute was hard to look at, putting any points in Luck would not be of much use to him. Luck was related to item drop rate and some abilities, but he did not depend on luck for anything, nor did he have any abilities that were related to Luck. Furthermore, just a few points in Luck would be useless. If he wanted to take that path, he would have to at least put in dozens of points. Even then, it would still not make much of a difference. Hence, he continued to put all his Free Attribute Points into Intelligence.

After he finished allocating his Free Attribute Points, his attributes after Promotion were laid out clearly.

_____________________

7,700 Energy Rank, yet to achieve B+. However, my actual combat capability is on par with Grade B+. The standard of Grade A is 10,000 Ona. At this pace, I should reach the Calamity Grade twenty to thirty levels earlier than the players at around level 140.

Han Xiao nodded with a smile.

I’m now level 116, and I still have one Mission Completion Card, so the only thing that I am short of is Experience. In order to rapidly gain Experience and quickly level up, harvesting the players is the best way. Therefore, as long as my plan is successfully carried out in the Mutation Disaster incident and I guide the Planet Aquamarine players to my faction, I will be able to reach Grade A in the next version!

After letting the cleaning robot clear the blood stains on the floor, Han Xiao walked out of the Simulated Combat Room. As soon as he returned to the hall, the people there turned and looked at him with surprise.

“Am I hallucinating, or did you... change?” Herlous asked suspiciously.

Sylvia walked around Han Xiao a few times, patted her chest, and sighed with relief. “I almost thought I mistook someone else for you.”

“Is it that obvious?” Han Xiao’s mouth twitched. His looks did indeed change after the Race Evolution, but he did not think it was a noticeable change at all.

“Your looks did not change much; its mainly the vibe that you’re giving off. You seem to be more mysterious. Also, I don’t remember you having this crystal on your forehead...” Herlous felt a shiver down his spine. “Strange, I’m feeling a certain pressure from you, but we should have about the same strength. What did you do when you locked yourself in that room?”

Of course, they did not know that Han Xiao could quickly complete his Race Evolution through the interface while it would take a very long time for others to fully complete the Race Evolution. The difference in the time that it took was incomparable.

“I’m stronger than before.” Han Xiao smiled and waved his hand. “I won’t explain the details. Anyway, I’m still me.”

“Do you also have some special training tactic like Feidin?” Herlous asked.

Feidin, who was meditating, opened his eyes and asked, “Who’s calling me?”

“Shut up!”

“Oh.”

Herlous always had a problem with Feidin. He snorted, looked at Han Xiao, and asked, “Are we going to Noriosse next?”

Han Xiao nodded. “Yes. I’ve completed what I wanted to do. Ames asked me to go to Noriosse and find her teacher.”

He was much stronger, but it would still take a very long time for him to reach Ames’ level. Before then, Han Xiao did not mind having someone to rely on. After all, Galaxy was so enormous; there were too many strong individuals and organizations. Furthermore, Ames had saved him once, so it was only right that he helped her do small things like this as much as he could. Having a good relationship with a Beyond Grade A was definitely beneficial, not to mention that he was under the Dragon Emperor’s command.

This time, Herlous intercepted Han Xiao and said, “Before going to Noriosse, I want to return to Planet Sunil and retrieve my armor, [Shattered Light]. Planet Sunil is nearby anyway, so it won’t take long.”

Han Xiao’s eyes sparkled.

He had been interested in the Commander Class armor for a very long time. Back then, he did not have the ability to work on it, but now, he satisfied the requirements.

“No problem, we will go together.”

...

The spaceship slowly landed on the plains outside the Forest City. This had once been the battlefield to fight against the Catastrophe, a place where blood spilled formed rivers. Now, it had been cleaned up and was an empty, burnt ground.

The six layers of defenses outside Forest City were already built. Pairs of armored guards patrolled the area, and vehicles drove into the forest to hunt from time to time.

As soon as they landed, many guards surrounded them and lined up to welcome them. Herlous had contacted the Sunil government before they arrived. When they disembarked the spaceship, those guards loudly yelled a phrase in the Sunil language, expressing their admiration to Herlous.

“Let’s go, I have already contacted the officials, so we will be heading to the research lab to retrieve my armor.” Herlous smiled.

They followed the soldiers and entered Forest City. Compared to a year earlier, there were not many changes other than the fact that there were even fewer people on the streets. It was probably because more youngster had joined the military forces.

“Are you Herlous? Oh my god, my hero!”

This time, the pedestrians around them noticed Herlous. They surrounded him excitedly, and even Han Xiao and the others were pushed aside.

Herlous hastily put up a friendly smile and chatted with them for a while. As more and more people joined in, he could not handle their passion anymore, so he hurriedly squeezed out of the crowd. The few of them took a few turns and finally escaped from the crowd.

“You’re very popular, I see.” Han Xiao laughed.

Herlous was embarrassed. “The officials need a role model to boost the residents’ confidence, so they replayed my stories every day on television and radio to praise me. Everyone in this city knows me.”

“National hero, so cool.” Sylvia’s eyes were shining.

“Cool my ass, a hero’s ending is always sacrifice,” Herlous protested. He still remembered Han Xiao’s ‘foresight’.

When they sneaked up to the doors of the government in the middle of the city, there were no more residents around. Herlous approached and reported his arrival. Very soon, a few military officers walked out and greeted him. These were matters of the Sunils; Han Xiao had no interest in listening, so he paid no attention along the way.

After talking for a while, Herlous beckoned the others, and they walked into the restricted military site, following the officers. After passing by metal gates one after another, they came to a sealed research lab. It was very spacious and even had a garage that stored machinery in the process of being modified.

They came to an experiment room. Herlous’ Commander Class armor was placed on the experiment table. Ten or so researchers were surrounding it and testing its parameters.

The officer walked up to the researchers and said, “This is General Herlous; he’s here to collect his armor. These are the permits.”

Han Xiao’s eyebrows shot up. He poked Herlous’ back and softly asked, “When did you become a general?”

Herlous grinned and replied softly as well. “It’s just on paper.”

The Head of Research was experimenting excitedly when he heard the officer. He glanced over Han Xiao and the others with an impatient expression, walked up to the gate, and said, “I thought we agreed on giving it to me for research. Why are you suddenly taking it away?”

“I heard you have already achieved some results, so I want to take my armor back,” Herlous said. “It’s very useful to me.”

Unwillingness was clearly written on the Head of Research’s face. “How can we return it to you? This armor is related to Sunil’s top technology; it’s a national treasure and doesn’t belong to you alone.”

“Er... but I was the one that gave it to the nation. I don’t see what’s wrong with me wanting it back.”

“Aren’t you a national hero? Are you not even willing to make such a small contribution?” The Head of Research frowned.

Herlous sighed. He gave a look to the officer beside him, and the officer took out the documents that proved that Herlous’ request was authorized by the superiors. The researchers saw it and had no choice but to obey the order. They took the armor, placed it into a metal box, and handed it to Herlous.

“I got it, let’s go.” Herlous touched the box and smiled.

The Head of Research was trembling with rage. “If the armor is with us, we will definitely be able to achieve greater results and provide more help for the race. You’re too selfish!”

Herlous’ face changed slightly, but he did not say anything. However, just as he was about to leave, he realized that Han Xiao’s footsteps stopped.

Han Xiao turned around and walked up to the Head of Research. He grabbed his head, forcing the Head of Research to look him in the eyes, and coldly said, “I remember when he followed me through difficult battles covered in wounds. I remember his misery when he lost an arm. I remember his agony when I planted a prosthetic into him. If not for your bullsh*t race, he could have a very comfortable life in the vast universe. So, what I don’t understand is, how is he selfish?

“Is it because he’s a good man, so you dare to insult him ruthlessly, knowing that he will not hurt you?”

Han Xiao suddenly turned into Void Form. His pitch-black eyes stared at the Head of Research as he gently said, “But I’m not like him. If you dare speak another word of insult to my subordinate, I will stuff your head up your ass.”
