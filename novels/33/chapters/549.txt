Chapter 550: It’s Time to Take out the Dusty Juicer

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

In the Hub Center, Han Xiao was busy purchasing materials through the store. In addition to fuel for the spaceship and replacement parts, the Logistics Department of Floating Dragon also got him to purchase some items when they received word that he was returning.

While he was engrossed in shopping, his communicator suddenly beeped. Glancing at it, Han Xiao’s lips involuntarily curled up in response before he nonchalantly threw his communicator back into his pocket and continued his shopping.

He slowly picked out his items and paid for his goods leisurely. Han Xiao casually stood at the side whilst the staff loaded his items onto a suspension aircraft. At this time, an aircraft from the hub stopped at the door of the store.

A member of staff hurriedly ran out from the aircraft, rushing up to Han Xiao.

“Your... Your Excellency Black Star! Your spaceship....”

Han Xiao waved his hand dismissively, cutting off the other’s speech as he smiled. “No problem, isn’t it just a group of petty thieves trying to steal my spaceship? How many of them are still alive?”

The staff from the hub was startled and hurriedly nodded in response. “When we arrived, only one of them was still alive. He’s severely injured, and we’ve already captured him. Your spaceship is also undamaged...”

“Let’s go and take a look.” Han Xiao nodded, and sitting in the hovercraft loaded full of his goods, he proceeded with the staff close behind. After a short while, they arrived at the crime scene. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The first thing he saw was that the hangar door had been blown to pieces. The outside passage was full of black scorched marks, with many guards surrounding the area.

Next to the hangar, a burly man was tied up tightly by electromagnetic bindings. The battle suit on his body was riddled with holes, with his whole body full of scars. He looked like he was on his last breath.

Han Xiao leaned forward to get a look. The interior of the hangar was a mess, with the wall having been shattered in places, exposing electrical wires that sizzled and sparkled like fireworks.

The lights flickered on and off intermittently, and the ground was covered with bloodstains. Lying around were over ten corpses covered with white cloth. The BlackLight Stealth remained motionless on the ground like an obedient child, sleek and smooth like a mirror with no blemishes.

“This is the guy who wanted to steal my spaceship?”

Han Xiao walked up to the severely injured Befuli, his eyes full of sympathy.

His BlackLight Stealth was the current host for Risda. Having long received the news from Risda, he was not worried at all.

This bunch of petty thieves had actually dared covet Risda, so they had definitely been asking for death. They were facing a spaceship with consciousness, one such as the BlackLight Stealth with high end specs and superior weaponry at that.

Even for Han Xiao himself, it would be easier to face off against a group of Grade B Supers than to face off against the BlackLight Stealth. Its fighting strength was off the charts, and one was unlikely to succeed unless they were a Calamity Grade Super with too much time on their hands. Besides, even if there was a Calamity Grade Super, the BlackLight Stealth could still escape from them even if it could not beat them.

Thus, Han Xiao was assured about the safety of his spaceship. Unless pigs could fly, the ship would remain safe and sound.

“Your Excellency Black Star, we’ve checked the database. This person is a galactic pirate from the Fawn Galaxy...”

One of the staff carried a transparent handheld screen with him as he explained. Before he could finish, however, Han Xiao directly took the screen.

Glancing through it, Han Xiao was startled.

“Befuli, with an Esper ability of shooting flames from his eyes... eh, isn’t that Laser Eyes? To think that it’s someone from the Purple Snake Space Pirates... I seem to have dealt with them in the past...”

Han Xiao began to recall that the leader of this band of pirates should be a Calamity Grade Super but on the weaker side.

His eyeballs moved while deep in thought. Han Xiao finally hefted Befuli up, saying, “Since this guy wanted to steal my spaceship, leave him for me to handle.”

“That goes without saying. To have you face such inconvenience, it’s our mistake. We have failed in our roles.” The staff nodded in response.

After allowing the staff and guards in the hub to disperse, Han Xiao stepped into his spaceship, and found a room before unceremoniously throwing Befuli onto the ground.

“You didn’t do your intelligence research properly, and you still dared make a move. If it was a normal spaceship, you might have succeeded, but you’re really unlucky. Do you have any thoughts about this?” Han Xiao poked fun at the other party.

Befuli’s wounds were still fresh, causing him to grit his teeth in pain. He was in too much pain to even open his mouth.

They had clearly blocked the signal of the spaceship, but the whole ship had powered up as though it had a life of its own, firing a whole bunch of lasers and cannons. His battlesuit had quickly shattered.

Befuli expertise lay in offense, but his laser eyes could not negate the laser cannons that were similarly comprised of energy. Because his physical defense was not up to par, he could hardly withstand the damage dealt by the cannon. If not for the fact that the guards had reached the area on time, he would also have lost his life to the spaceship.

Having fallen into the hands of Black Star, Befuli felt so much regret that his intestines were twisted up. He did not know what Black Star was going to do to him.

Since Black Star has not killed me, he probably thinks that I am of some value to him. This is a good idea. He probably wants to use me to obtain intelligence. I need to cooperate and cement my value so that he won’t think of killing me! The killing power of my ability is extremely strong, so long as he is negligent, I can escape!

Befuli’s palms were sweating as all kinds of thoughts flashed through his head. While he was a famed ruthless galactic pirate, when faced with life-threatening danger, his thoughts spun rapidly.

As long as he did not die, he would have another chance!

Han Xiao patted the shoulder of Befuli. “You should be an officer of the Purple Snake Space Pirates. I presume to put this debt on the head of Purple Snake then. Right now, I have no time to deal with them, but it’s fine. Currently, my Mercenary Group requires sparring partners, and Purple Snake seems to be a good choice. When the time comes, I’ll personally visit your head.

“As for you...”

Han Xiao looked straight into Befuli’s eyes before letting out a playful smile. “Since you came straight to my door, don’t blame me for what I’m about to do.”

Befuli felt a chill run down his body, but before he could process the meaning behind Han Xiao’s words, he suddenly felt a sharp pain in his arm. He only saw Black Star holding onto a round shaped machine, pressing it into the blood vessel of his arm. There seemed to be a needle that had pierced into him.

“This is...”

Before Befuli could express his surprise, he suddenly felt his strength rapidly diminish. He only saw the round machine being filled up with his blood. He could not help but widen his eyes as a sense of weakness rose up within him.

An Esper’s ability was part of their body, just like the arms or legs. To have this ability forcibly stripped away, it was as though stripping him of his abilities. At this point, even his last assurance was gone.

“What’s this‽” Befuli’s facial expression greatly changed, showing distress. His current condition had fallen drastically short of his expectations.

Super-Gene Extractor!

In the past year, Han Xiao had rarely had a chance to use his juicer. The main purpose was because he did not manage to capture any evildoers. The former captive Rezar had long been sucked dry. Since there was no way for him to continue, Han Xiao could only set him free.

Currently, other than juicing himself once in a while to form the Ability Potions, he did not perform it on anyone else.

Since Befuli had wrapped himself up and gone over, Han Xiao would definitely not feel guilty. They were enemies, and thus, he had to fully utilize his worth. The ability to shoot lasers from one’s eyes was handsome yet strong—how could he resist?

Very quickly, three tubes of crimson Ability Potion were produced. Han Xiao took one of them, drinking it all in one go. The moment he swallowed it, a heat was produced almost instantly.

Yo, this damage is sick. Definitely a pure offense Esper ability!

Han Xiao’s eyes sparkled.

If one could burn a target for the full five seconds, they would inflict at least 7,600 damage. The highest would be... painful, so painful. Furthermore, the skill was an AOE 1 attack!

Even when faced against a Grade B Super, after deducting the damage resistance, one could inflict at least 3,000 to 4,000 damage. Furthermore, the ability was shot from one’s eyes, which meant a free gift of damage since it did not hinder one’s actions.

Han Xiao lowered his head, looking at Befuli with a smile.

“Let’s get on well.”

Befuli lay weakly on the ground, muttering disconsolately to himself. Looking at Han Xiao’s eyes that had the intention of raising a lamb for the slaughter, in Befuli’s eyes, Black Star was worse than himself by more than a hundred times!

He suddenly had a sort of premonition, that his future life... would be spent wishing he was dead!

...

Han Xiao had knocked out the information of Befuli’s accomplices from him; however, the moment Befuli had failed, the rest of the galactic pirates had long taken their ship and escaped. Han Xiao did not wish to delay his trip, so he did not bother to pursue the pirates.

He was already treating the Purple Snake Space Pirates group as nourishment for the players, so he was in no hurry to deal with his problem.

The BlackLight Stealth set off again. After this little episode, they did not stop at all along the way, and naturally, there were no other problems.

A few days later, Floating Dragon Island appeared on his radar.

Han Xiao navigated his spaceship to descend. Floating Dragon had long been informed of his return, with Wilsander waiting at the dock to welcome him. The logistics manager, Haier, was also present. What gave Han Xiao a surprise was that Jenny was standing by the side, albeit with a black face, obviously also there to welcome him.

“Hahaha, Black Star, you’re finally back.” Wilsander laughed, his tail swishing as he came up to give him a hug.

Han Xiao turned his head slightly and was almost blinded due to Wilsander’s devil horns.

“Ji ji ji ji...” Haier let out words of a weird language before realizing that he did not turn on his translator. After activating it, he said, “Black Star, did you bring the materials I requested?”

“They’re all onboard.” Han Xiao nodded in return. After pondering a bit, he added, “Please remember to compensate me. They were pretty expensive.”

Following which, Han Xiao turned to look at Jenny, putting on a weird expression as he said, “How come you also came over to welcome me?”

“Do you think I want to?” Jenny was expressionless, reluctantly replying. “Ames wishes to see you.”

“Oh, how rare.” Han Xiao was a little surprised. After helping Ames with the problem of searching for Aesop the previous time, they had not had any contact since. He did not know why she was looking for him.”

Just as the few of them were chatting, the various people present at the dock turned over to look, their gazes filled with curiosity and surprise.

“It’s the four officers of Floating Dragon! To think that they are all gathered together!”

“That guy in the black suit should be the Head of the Field Team for Floating Dragon, Black Star. I heard that the Dragon Emperor wishes to expand her influence, and Black Star is currently expanding her armed forces. His authority is huge.”

“I heard Black Star has set foot in the Garton Star System. Is that the intention of the Dragon Emperor? Does she want in as well?”

The expansion of Han Xiao’s mercenary group had raised some suspicions in the galaxy. Many people felt that Ames was supporting him from behind, sending a signal to everyone. The Dragon Emperor, who had never contested for anything, was finally wanting to obtain the influence deserving of her status as a Beyond Grade A Super.

Black Star was the General leading the vanguard to express the Dragon Emperor’s intentions!
