Chapter 816 Mechanic Class Top Mentor

The group of them entered the school’s central building. The Mechanic students were not allowed to enter, so they loitered around outside for a while and gradually left one after another.

Han Xiao and the others came to the principal’s guest room. A bionic mechanical assistant secretary brought them some drinks. The principal invited them to sit. “Your Excellency Black Star, please wait for a moment. I’ll relay your request to my superiors.”

Han Xiao nodded and watched the principal leave. The group waited in the room.

Nero leaned on the window and curiously looked at the scenery in the school. Small mechanical islands hovered in the sky, metal buildings in yellow and blue stood tall on the ground, students crossed between the buildings riding mechanical skateboards, and the red, yellow, and green forests waved with the wind. The alloy buildings coexisted with the artificial greenery, forming a harmonious color tone. It had a special sense of beauty.

“This place looks so different from Planet Aquamarine. It’s so beautiful.” Everything was fresh to Nero.

“This is nothing. The dynasty school at the Crimson Dynasty’s mother planet is much more magnificent than this.” Han Xiao chuckled. He had brought Nero out not just to rub some luck from him but also to broaden Nero’s knowledge.

“Really? I want to see that.” Nero was really interested.

“I’ll take you there if there’s a chance.” Han Xiao beckoned Nero over, pointed at the drink on the table, and said, “Come, try it. It’s good.”

On the table were a few cups of hot white liquid flickering with a tint of light gold, giving off a thick milky fragrance. This was some kind of milk product provided by the Tyla Civilization.

Nero picked up the cup and took a sip. His eyes widened, and he gulped down a mouthful. He exhaled in satisfaction, licked away the white stain on his mouth, and looked like he wanted more.

“How was it?”

“Godfather, what is this? I’ve never tasted such delicious milk before.”

Han Xiao smiled and explained, “When the Tyla Civilization was exploring a certain colonial planet, they discovered a galactic being that was on the verge of extinction. They were called the Herepoli Beasts, commonly known as the Giant Nebula Beasts. They are extremely large and can travel in the universe with their body. Some even call them the Mount of Giant Gods. However, the reproduction speed of the Giant Nebula Beasts is very long; they only mate every hundred years or so. After their cubs are born, they enter a three-month lactation period. The Giant Nebula Beasts only produce milk in those three short months. Their milk is rare, expensive, nourishing, and very unique. That’s what you drank.”

“I see.” Nero rubbed his stomach. “No wonder my body feels so warm after drinking it.”

“Do you want more? Drink mine too.” Han Xiao smiled.

Nero licked his lips and was very tempted. After some tough internal conflict, he shook his head and said, “This is so valuable and rare; I can’t drink it all. Godfather, you drink it too.”

The others all laughed.

“I’m fine.” Han Xiao shook his hand. Luxurious things that were extremely valuable to normal galactic residents were nothing much in his eyes. He could have plenty if he wanted.

However, he did not have much interest in luxurious consumables. He preferred to buy more special grade nutrition pastes with that money, which were much more convenient to consume and recovered his stamina very quickly, much higher quality-price ratio.

After chatting for a while, the principal had yet to return. Han Xiao turned around and looked at the mechanical assistant secretary that stood still beside the wall.

“How may I be of service to you?” The mechanical assistant secretary sensed his sights and responded immediately.

Han Xiao shook his hand and observed the bionic skin of this mechanical assistant secretary.

This principal looked respectable and reputable, but the bionic appearance given to this mechanical secretary was extremely seductive and sexy. It might really have the full set of functions of a ‘secretary’...

After waiting a while longer, the principal finally returned.

“Sorry to have kept you waiting, Your Excellency Black Star. The people above have agreed with your request and allowed me to use my authority to help you to find that data.”

“Okay, thank the upper echelons of the Tyla Civilization for me.” Han Xiao was relieved. Things were much easier now that it was settled with his face. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

He was reminded of how even Star System civilizations did not give him face at all in the past, and he had to find someone to help him. Now that he was a Beyond Grade A, even the Star Cluster civilizations were willing to give him face.

The principal pressed a few times on the office desk. The color of it suddenly changed as it became the control screen of the internal database. He looked up and asked, “Your Excellency Black Star, do you remember the time and location of the data?”

Han Xiao nodded and told him. The principle then inputted the corresponding parameters and ran the search engine to look for related data.

Although they agreed to help, they were not going to let a Beyond Grade A operate their internal database, so the principal was assisting him.

Countless items flashed past the screen. After scrolling for a while, only one item was left that perfectly matched the parameters.

The principal exhaled deeply. “Found it. Looks like Harrofal uploaded the data; the time and location are both right. See if this is the data you wanted.”

Han Xiao walked over and browsed through it carefully. Although he did not professionally study wormholes like Harrofal, he had related professional knowledge of it and could understand the coordinates. However, this set of coordinates was outside the star map of the known universe and had a very complicated set of parameters. Without a star map, nothing could be discerned from just the data. He would only know where it led after studying it.

“EsGod was so concerned with this set of data. Which corner of the universe did his doppelganger get thrown to?” Han Xiao wondered.

Confirming that this set of data was from when Harrofal banished the EsGod doppelganger, Han Xiao blinked and took hundreds of photos instantly, which were transmitted to Phillip’s database. He then nodded at the principal.

“Looks like I’m in luck. I’ve already made a back up. Thank you for this.”

The principal shut down the screen, and the desk returned to normal. He then smiled and said, “I’m glad you’ve found what you came for. I have one thing I hope to ask from you.”

Han Xiao was not surprised at all—the Tyla Civilization would not help him for free if they did not want to obtain something from him in exchange.

“If it’s within my capabilities, I will help.”

“Haha, you’re mistaken. All we want to do is for you to become an honorary professor of the Tyla Official Mechanic School.”

That’s it? Han Xiao was a little surprised. After some thinking, he then understood their intention.

As the one and only Beyond Grade A Mechanic in the Shattered Star Ring, if he became a professor at the Tyla Civilization’s official mechanic school, the name of this school would be much more famous and would attract tons more students. Many Mechanic students would apply to study in this school, which would give the Tyla Civilization more talents. Furthermore, as a professor of the Tyla Civilization’s official school, it somewhat meant he was on their side. The Tyla Civilization would benefit a lot from this.

Since they had just helped him, Han Xiao was not going to reject such a small request. He nodded and said, “Sure.”

The principal was delighted. “Then I shall have my people settle it immediately. By the way, since you’re an honorary professor of the school, I hope you can host a lecture here. Either tomorrow or the day after is fine. It won’t take too much time. If you don’t mind, I’ll get my men to announce it within the school.”

“Alright, I shall stay here and trouble you for a few more days.”

Thinking about it, Han Xiao suddenly said, “By the way, since I’m now a professor of this school, why don’t you give me a copy of the basic and advanced lessons of your school?”

The lessons of official schools like this were all very carefully authored. The fundamental textbooks would be quite useful for factions, so he could take them back and train the Mechanic Supers of the army in a systematic way.

Some high-grade Supers might not be good at teaching despite their strength... for example, Rey ‘Forceful Education’ Nold...

Since Han Xiao was now an honorary professor of this school, he might as well gain something from it.

...

The next day, the Tyla Civilization immediately announced in a very high-profile way that they had successfully hired Black Star to be the honorary professor of their official mechanic school. They contacted a bunch of galactic media outlets to spread this news.

Currently, many of the civilizations in the Shattered Star Ring were the Black Star Army’s business allies, but being an honorary professor of a civilization’s official school signified an even closer relationship. The first ones to receive this news were the various Star Cluster civilizations of the Shattered Star Ring; they were all shocked and felt it was so sudden. Why did Black Star suddenly get mixed with the Tyla Civilization?

The Purple Crystal was even more shocked. Never mind you sneaking into the Crimson Dynasty’s bed, we can’t mess with them, so we’ll live with it, but how can you flirt with that shameless neighbor? You *sshole, did you forget I’m your origina... ahem, your earliest ally who has invested the most in you‽

Han Xiao’s communicator was almost exploding from Ralph’s calls, and he spent some time to finally calm him down.

This piece of news also shocked the many students in the Tyla Official Mechanic School.

Black Star is now our school’s honorary professor, and he’s going to do a lecture‽

How did that perverted principal convince Black Star‽

The students were exhilarated and honored.

Originally, the lecture was supposed to be carried out inside the building, but there were too many students attending, so the school decided to have Han Xiao give the lecture at the open central square.

As the day of the lecture arrived, the area was completely filled with people. There were absolutely no empty seats, and countless students even hovered in the air, riding mechanical skateboards. More than ninety percent of the people in the entire school came.

Most of the teachers and professors went to listen too—in front of a Beyond Grade A Mechanic, they were all students.

Han Xiao stood in the middle of the freshly built tall stage in the middle of the central square, looked around, and smiled bitterly in his mind.

He had thought that he would just be teaching a small group of students; never had he expected to create such a scene. Not only were there so many people here, but there were also even many recording devices around that videoed his every move. It was almost like a concert or even preaching.

Of course, he had no problem doing this. He did not even mind fist fighting with Heber in front of trillions of galactic residents back then, so this would not affect him at all. With his Beyond Grade A standard, he just had to casually share some experiences, and these students would be satisfied.

However, Han Xiao was not really used to this. Currently, the person who used lectures as core competitiveness was that old man Austin.

“Ahem, let’s get started...” Han Xiao cleared his throat and started speaking.

...

At the Bloodshed Land’s headquarters, Heber was confused. “Black Star went to give an open lecture to a Star Cluster civilization’s official school? He’s got to go to the Flickering World soon, yet he still has the time to do that‽”

Inside the Palace of Hidden Spells, Austin murmured with a strange expression, “This guy, is he trying to imitate me and form a Hidden Machinery Abbey or something?”

“Tsk, I hate Mechanics.” On the Star Pupil Holy Race Mother Planet, Psyker shut down the screen without hesitation. He did not want to see Han Xiao at all. Every time he saw the Evolution Cube on his neck, his heart would ache... every single time.

In the Crimson Dynasty Diplomatic Building, Zoel shook his head and laughed. “Yo, this guy is doing it again?”

From the way he looked at it, Han Xiao was not satisfied with his current position and went to form alliances with more Star Cluster civilizations.

He was happy to see this as long as it did not affect the main business. The more influence the dynasty’s ally had in a Star Field, the better it was for them.

As for the players who were at the Black Star Army headquarters, some also discovered the broadcast on the galactic channels. Word quickly spread among the players, and more and more players turned on their communicators to watch Han Xiao’s lecture curiously.

“Huh, I thought the Army Commander has been in the headquarters. Turns out he went to another civilization.”

“What’s he talking about? Why does it sound like complete gibberish?”

When the many players were watching curiously, the Mechanic players among them were suddenly startled—a notification popped up on their interfaces.

All the Mechanic class players who were watching the broadcast were shocked.

“This is... imparting ability experiences‽”

The Mechanic class players were overjoyed.

This was the notification that would pop up when NPCs shared abilities or their experiences with the players, but events that gave random ability EXP were very rare. The Mechanic class players did not expect this at all; they had only watched the broadcast out of curiosity and happened to trigger this amazing event.

Very soon, this piece of news spread on the forums like a typhoon. All the Mechanic class players came to know about it and all went to watch the broadcast with excitement.

“Holy, my Mechanic class ability leveled up!”

“Is this a random event?”

“This is so much quicker than doing missions... damn, my [Intermediate Machinery Affinity] is at Lv.9, one level from maximum!”

“The Army Commander is awesome, as always!”

Leveling up abilities was always a bottomless pit of EXP, so the Mechanic class players were euphoric.

The players of the other four classes could only watch the Mechanic class players with jealousy.

It had been a very long time since Han Xiao had personally taught the players any abilities. As his interaction with the players decreased, many players had gradually started to forget the things he did in the past. This accident coincidentally made countless players recall that he was once a mentor.

Because of this, he became the recognized Top Mechanic Class Mentor!
