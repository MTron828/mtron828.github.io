Chapter 2763: The New Holy Lord

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

After a conversation with Alester, Qin Yu had many comprehends.

He also understood many details of cultivation. Alester concluded Qin Yu must cultivate the peak power no matter what.

Otherwise, the future stages would have nothing to do with him.

Before that, he could not continue to cultivate the Dao of Dreams and other cultivation techniques.

Otherwise, it would be even more difficult for him to awaken the peak power as the power of the Dao of Dreams grew stronger.

“Something big has happened in the Saint World. I’m leaving the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom. If there’s a chance, you can head to the Land of Calamity to find me. The Alester family is there.”

Alester seemed to have received some information. She pondered for a moment and said to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu nodded and ended their short interaction.

“Thank you.”

Alester suddenly turned around.

Following Alester’s departure, the sky above Lingxu City suddenly changed.

A bright light suddenly burst out from a faraway place. The blinding light was like the explosion of a star.

At the same time, a huge pressure washed over like a river.

Even though she was extremely far away, Qin Yu could still feel a terrifying Holy Power.

Looking at the changing sky, Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Was Alester’s departure related to this change?

He went to Lingxu City’s trading market after a while.

A few months had passed since Heavenly Sin’s appearance. The streets in Lingxu City had returned to their former prosperity.

Who knew how many people would remember the hundreds of thousands of skeletons that died tragically in the Heavenly Sin?

“Boss Qin Yu, you’re still alive!”

Qin Yu heard a surprised cry the moment he appeared in the trading market.

As the head of the pimps in the trading market, Wang Da instantly knew of Qin Yu’s arrival.

“Hahaha, I’m rich! The da*n old man didn’t tell me either. He hurriedly went into seclusion the moment he returned.”

Wang Da laughed loudly. His eyes were sparkling.

A person who walked out of the Heavenly Sin. He was one of the few people who came out alive out of hundreds of thousands of people.

This was a piece of gold no matter where it was placed. Most importantly, he was related to this gold.

“Take me to Cang Yunzi. I have some things to ask him.”

“Alright, no problem. The old man changed his location. He specifically told me to bring you there immediately once you come to find him!”

Wang Da grinned, revealing a few big yellow teeth.

Soon, the two of them arrived at another room. This place was close to a huge lake.

It was a huge house that looked like a seaside villa. The luxurious rooms made Qin Yu envious.

“Old man, Qin Yu is here!”

“Come in, but you don’t have to.”

A voice was heard, and the instructions made Wang Da’s face turn red with anger.

“Da*n old man.”

Wang Da cursed as he left, but he suddenly thought of something and returned.

“Qin Yu, there’s a piece of information still being confirmed. Come to the trading market in three days. I might be able to give you a surprise then.”

“Okay!”

Qin Yu nodded and walked into the old man’s villa.

Cang Yunzi sat cross-legged on the balcony. At this moment, his internal qi seemed to have become much stronger.

Moreover, his body was filled with a youthful internal qi. The death qi on his body had completely faded.

“Taoist Priest Cang Yunzi, it seems like you have gained a lot from your trip to Heavenly Sin.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qin Yu said with a smile.

“The power of Heavenly Sin is unpredictable. It seems to know the predicament of my body. The power of the curse mark turned into a powerful longevity power and made me young again. I have to thank you for this time. If it weren’t for you, I’m afraid I wouldn’t have been able to obtain this opportunity.”

Cang Yunzi couldn’t remember what happened following that, but he could see the huge benefits he had obtained. “Qin Yu, did you get anything?” Cang Yunzi was curious.

“I haven’t noticed it yet.”

“You must make good use of this time. The power of the curse mark is extraordinary. Everyone inside has obtained many benefits. Don’t waste this power!”

Cang Yunzi warned solemnly.

Qin Yu nodded.

He also intended to start cultivating, but he did not expect the appearance of the strange phenomenon just now to disrupt his plan.

“Taoist priest, did you notice the strange phenomenon just now? What was that?”

“If I’m not wrong, a new Holy Lord has appeared in the Saint Realm. Moreover, she is extremely powerful. Even the older Saints are probably not as powerful as her.”

“Masked woman…”

“Do you know about it too?”

Cang Yunzi was slightly surprised.

There were only two Saint Kingdoms without a Holy Lord now. One was the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom, whereas the other was the Holy Lord Yan Tianfeng who had died from a sneak attack.

Qin Yu already knew that the masked woman was trying to become a Saint Level Holy Lord, but he didn’t expect her to be so fast.

However, the masked woman had already gathered all 81 Hearts of Saint Kingdom. This speed was simply unbelievable.

One had to know that Yan Tianfeng’s death was only less than a hundred years before the Dao Xuan Holy Lord’s death.

“Also, there’s another piece of information. After the masked woman of the ninth generation becomes a Holy Lord, she seems to want to start a holy war. However, we don’t know who her target is for the time being.” Cang Yunzi told him another shocking piece of news.

“In any case, chaos is imminent. If the flames of war engulf the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom and you have no intention of getting your hands on the Saint position, then leave this place as soon as possible.”

The start of the holy war was a battle to the death.

If one was involved, there was an 80% to 90% chance that one would not even have a corpse left.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment before he nodded.

“Qin Yu, there’s something else I have to tell you. During this period, the Path of Heaven Academy, the Upper Dome, and the Guardian of Order have all contacted me. Their target is you. Your Soul Suppression Ring is a power comparable to the Heavenly Sin, especially to experts who have cultivated the peak power. It’s a fatal temptation. Gu Ying has illustrated this principle.”

He had unleased Dream Qi in the Heavenly Sin and the Nineteenth Prison in the Endless Mine.

After combining the two, it was not difficult to guess that the Soul Suppression Ring was in Qin Yu’s hands.

“Thank you, Taoist Priest Cang Yunzi.”

“Do you want to cultivate here? They don’t dare to make a move in Lingxu City.”

Cang Yunzi said with a smile.

“I can solve these problems myself.”

After Qin Yu obtained the information he wanted, he left immediately.

Cang Yunzi told him this information, so he didn’t want to cause trouble for him.

Offending the three factions meant that almost all of them would be in trouble in this Saint Kingdom.

He should be safe in the city, but he couldn’t let his guard down.

Qin Yu found a new place to stay.

He hadn’t cultivated properly after he came out from Heavenly Sin..
