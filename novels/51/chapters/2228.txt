2229 River of Bone Cultivation

“So what if I’m here? It’s just nice to settle the matter of you disturbing my cultivation in the Moon Listening Pavilion in one go.”

Qin Yu’s expression was indifferent.

He stepped forward and arrived in front of Xuan Ren.

With a punch, Xuan Ren’s chest caved in. No one knew how many bones he had broken. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“He actually didn’t die! As expected of an old b*stard.”

Qin Yu sighed with emotion and said.

“Come over here! There are human cultivators here!” Xuan Ren shouted in fear.

Previously, when he was at the Moon Listening Pavilion, he thought Qin Yu was just an ordinary second-grade True Saint cultivator. He did not expect this punch to have nearly taken his life.

Dozens of powerful divine senses instantly locked onto Qin Yu. Before Qin Yu could react, a black figure slid past him like lightning, leaving five clear bloody marks on his body.

A human-bodied vulture stood a thousand meters away, staring coldly at Qin Yu.

“What a fast speed!”

Qin Yu’s pupils constricted. He completely failed to react in time.

All of a sudden, the shadow that was a thousand meters away turned into an afterimage. In the next moment, a giant claw as sharp as a knife had already grabbed Qin Yu’s dantian.

By a hair’s breadth, Qin Yu’s hand formed the line word formula, and he dodged with a sideways movement, leaving a few bloody marks on his abdomen.

“Again!”

Qin Yu’s eyes were like lightning as he threw out dozens of destructive punches. Dozens of black flames surrounded the vulture.

A gust of wind suddenly blew up without a sign. For a moment, sand and stones flew, and the vulture actually accelerated again under the effect of the wind.

The moment the Fist of Destruction and black flames surrounded him, it suddenly rushed out.

“Can you run away?”

At this moment, Qin Yu was generous with the spiritual energy in his body. He formed the line word formula with his hand and unleashed Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique beneath his feet, and directly followed the vulture.

“Die!”

Qin Yu stomped, and with a stomp of the cosmic form, the air seemed to be flattened.

The vulture crashed to the ground like a cannonball, but it was still breathing.

Qin Yu landed lightly on the ground and wanted to kill this vulture.

“Brat, it’s you again!”

Demon King Xuan Yuan ferociously jumped down from a mountain.

“Boom!”

A massive figure smashed down on Qin Yu like a mountain. The terrifying aura seemed to have sucked the air dry.

“Don’t think about escaping!”

Xuan Yuan roared.

A massive gravitational force violently pulled Qin Yu, and his body suddenly paused.

In just a moment, the giant shield had already smashed down.

Qin Yu crossed his fists to block the attack. The terrifying impact caused Qin Yu’s internal organs to tremble, and he spat a mouthful of blood.

“Hahaha, great! Someone actually came here to die. Looks like my blood river will have another slave.”

Xuan Yuan laughed out loud. His body suddenly jumped onto a high peak, and he raised the giant shield behind him and smashed it fiercely toward Qin Yu.

Qin Yu activated his Saintly Body Technique and stomped down.

This stomp directly shattered the ground, and the ground seemed to be torn apart.

An enormous crack extended to 10,000 meters away. With a stomp, Xuan Yuan’s gravitational space shattered directly.

Qin Yu only felt the void shaking. A green python that was nearly a hundred meters long suddenly broke through the space by the side.

In just an instant, Qin Yu was firmly tied up.

At this moment, Xuan Yuan’s strike with gathered force from above also arrived.

“Desolate Divine Eye!”

A white pupil appeared on Qin Yu’s forehead, and the giant shield above seemed to have broken into transparent lines.

The cracks on the turtle shell that had been nurtured for 6,000 years were also clearly seen.

Qin Yu raised his two fingers, and the spiritual energy in his entire body surged into his two fingers like a tsunami.

Then, a purple spiritual fire suddenly burned fiercely outside Qin Yu’s body.

That was Qin Yu’s innate demonic spiritual fire. The extreme temperature of the flame made the giant python’s body involuntarily loosen.

Qin Yu pointed a finger at the crack in the turtle shell, and Xuan Yuan’s violent aura suddenly stopped.

How was this possible?

Xuan Yuan’s eyes widened in disbelief.

The golden finger directly broke through his giant shield and pierced his abdomen.

“What a pity. If the damage on this giant shield had been a little more to the left side, this finger would have pierced through his dantian.”

“Whoosh!”

Seeing that the situation was not right, the spatial python suddenly fled into the void.

Qin Yu suddenly grabbed its tail and used the cosmic form to pull it out of the void.

“Rip!”

The python cut off a part of its body as it saw something wrong. It then suddenly fled into the void and dared not come out again.

“Hmm?”

At this moment, the world in Qin Yu’s eyes became grayish-white and transparent.

It was constructed from countless lines. Within a few thousand meters of space, it seemed that the lines of the way could also be seen.

On a mountain not far away from him, he saw a river flickering with a dim light using his Desolate Divine Eye.

“Such an enormous amount of demonic power!”

Qin Yu was shocked. Under the Desolate Divine Eye, all the spiritual energy and demonic qi could be seen clearly.

The ordinary spiritual energy was just faint white dots, but it was actually a river formed by the convergence of demonic power here.

His figure suddenly shot out and arrived at the upper part of the river.

A strong smell of blood rushed into Qin Yu’s nostrils. It was a blood-red river.

Countless white bones floated on the surface of the river. They were bones of human cultivators and demonic beasts.

In the blood river before him, the demonic qi within was intense to the extreme.

In Qin Yu’s shocking gaze, a giant ape was quietly soaking in the blood river.

Its body grew increasingly larger, and hundreds of black bone spikes pierced out of its back.

The ape’s muscles and bones kept cracking after the blood water flushed into the body of this demonic beast.

Under Qin Yu’s shocked gaze, the shattered flesh of the demonic beast actually grew at a speed visible to the naked eye.

His new skin shone with a black luster, and the bone spikes on his back formed a pair of wings.

This giant ape had actually completed its evolution in the river!

Qin Yu’s heart began to beat vigorously. Could he temper his body like this giant ape if he jumped into it?

Even if he couldn’t, his chaotic body could absorb this enormous amount of demonic qi. It was much faster than hunting demonic beasts everywhere.

The Desolate Divine Eye swept around. Within its observation, it discovered a hundred blood rivers here!

In other words, there were even more rivers containing demonic qi on the seventh level!

He turned his head and glanced at the blood river nearby. A young girl was soaking in the largest blood river nearby!

Qin Yu sensed that the young girl was emitting a dense demonic qi, but he could not tell what kind of demonic beast the young girl had transformed into.

The young lady slightly closed her eyes, and her long and slightly curled eyelashes fluttered unconsciously. Even though her body was soaked in the blood river, one could vaguely see her graceful body. There was also an obvious moon mark on her forehead.

She seemed to have sensed Qin Yu’s divine sense and suddenly opened her eyes.

After her indifferent eyes swept over Qin Yu, she closed her eyes again and fell into cultivation.
