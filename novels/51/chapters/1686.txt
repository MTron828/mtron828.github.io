Chapter 1687: Chapter 1,687. Are you old or are you afraid? 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Xiao Sheng snorted coldly and said, “Nothing is absolute. I have never been afraid.”

Qin Yu remained silent, but he felt that Xiao Sheng had overestimated him, or perhaps he had underestimated the strength of the reversion void stage.

Of course, he knew that Xiao Sheng’s strength was beyond ordinary people. The strength of the Xiao brothers could not be measured by common sense.

However, it was really too difficult to cross such a large realm. Qin Yu believed that he could not do it.

Qin Yu did not say much. He only advised, “If I really died at the hands of the defeated opponent in the past, it would definitely be a very unworthy thing.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and walked down the cultivation mountain.

At the foot of the Cultivation Mountain, the sect was bustling with activity.

Many people were gathered in a certain area and were incomparably excited.

Qin Yu walked forward and discovered that the person who was surrounded in the middle was none other than Di Zun.

At this moment, his clothes were tattered and full of injuries. However, his aura was unprecedentedly strong and powerful. This was because of his internal Qi.

“You’ve broken through?”Qin Yu walked forward and said with some surprise.

When he saw Qin Yu, Di Zun quickly walked forward.

He said excitedly, “Master, I’ve broken through.”

Qin Yu swept a glance at di zun and exclaimed, “You’ve actually stepped into the mighty realm?”

Di zun said somewhat embarrassedly, “I was just lucky. Just Lucky.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

This world seemed to have really changed.

With Di Zun’s talent, stepping into the mighty realm was naturally not a difficult matter. It was just that it was not that easy to comprehend the dao before stepping into the mighty realm.

Now that the world had changed, it seemed that it was much easier to comprehend the Dao.

“Congratulations.”Qin Yu patted Di Zun’s shoulder and said sincerely.

Di Zun touched his nose and said, “I’m still far from Master.”

Qin Yu smiled and did not say anything. In fact, the realm of the two of them was not much different. It was just that Qin Yu’s actual combat ability was much richer than Di Zun’s.

“Qin Yu, why is the sect master looking for you?”At this moment, the deputy sect master walked forward and asked.

Qin Yu did not know how to answer, so he smiled and said, “It’s nothing. It’s just a dao discussion.”

“You’re so young, but you’re already able to discuss Dao with the sect master.”The deputy sect master sighed.

“Do you have any plans next?”The deputy sect master asked.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No, I plan to stay in the Heavenly Cloud sect for a few days. I hope that the deputy sect leader won’t mind.”

“Hahahaha, I can’t wait.”The deputy sect leader patted Qin Yu’s shoulder.

The main reason why he stayed was to see if there would be people who had entered the reversion void stage coming to fight.

In the next few days, Qin Yu spent almost all his time in the library.

He was not interested in the spells of the Heavenly Cloud sect. Most of his time was spent reading about the history of the southern region, trying to find out the secret information about the curse of the east barren.

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

On this day, a strange phenomenon suddenly appeared in the sky. The light shone through the sky and the Earth. Darkness and light interweaved, and it was extremely terrifying!

Recently, the strange phenomenon was not rare, but such a scale and strange phenomenon could be said to be unheard of!

Everyone was shocked by the abnormal phenomenon in the sky, and Qin Yu was no exception.

He threw down the book in his hand, walked out of the library quickly, and raised his head to look at the sky.

This abnormal phenomenon seemed to have shocked the heavens, and a series of whimpering sounds were hidden behind the black clouds.

Seeing this scene, the surrounding people could not help but swallow their saliva wildly, and they discussed animatedly.

“This is… what level of heavenly tribulation is this, to actually be so terrifying!”

“I’m afraid this is what is called a real phenomenon, a phenomenon like the birth of a spirit pill!”

Qin Yu remained silent, but a trace of solemnity was revealed on his face.

With such a scale of phenomenon, it was likely that someone was about to step into the reversion void stage!

This Day had finally arrived!

Those hidden old monsters would likely appear one after another and attempt to step into the reversion void stage!

“Is the structure of the southern region about to change?”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

On the Cultivation Mountain, Xiao Sheng also raised his head and looked at the sky.

There was no sadness or joy on his face. It was extremely ordinary. No one could guess what he was thinking.

After a long time, the strange phenomenon in the sky slowly disappeared.

Finally, a trace of a smile appeared on Xiao Sheng’s face.

That smile contained a trace of coldness and indescribable anticipation.

“I’ll wait for you all,”Xiao Sheng muttered softly. No one knew who he was talking to.

In the next few days.

A few more anomalies of this scale appeared.

The entire southern region was discussing the powerful anomalies that had appeared in the past few days.

“This is strange. In just a few days, there are actually so many people trying to reach the reversion void stage.”

“The Golden Age truly lives up to its reputation!”

“It’s a good thing that there are people who have reached the reversion void stage! At the very least, there are people who can attack the northern lands!”

“Then who knows? Back then, when the elementalists came to make a ruckus, they had never made a move.”

In just a few days, there were at least six people who had reached the reversion void stage.

And this breakthrough was still ongoing.

Qin Yu sat in the library and could not help but think to himself, “With Chang Mang and the others’talent, I think they should have also broken through.”

The group of Heaven’s favorites on Earth had arrived a year earlier than Qin Yu. No one knew what level they had reached.

This made Qin Yu somewhat anxious, but also somewhat expectant.

To be able to compete with the heaven’s favorites in the Golden Age, just thinking about it made people feel a strong desire to fight!

On this day.

The usually peaceful heavenly cloud sect welcomed an uninvited guest.

An extremely skinny old man suddenly appeared at the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s entrance.

He had a hunched waist and was less than 1.6 meters tall. He looked extremely unremarkable.

Even his internal Qi was extremely calm, making it impossible for others to detect it.

However, it was this kind of old man that caused people to involuntarily feel their hearts palpitate!

Facing this old man was like facing a huge mountain. It was incomparably terrifying!

“Who… are you looking for?”The disciple at the door tried to ask.

This old man had his hands behind his back as he faintly said, “Saint Xiao.”

“You are looking for our sect leader?”This disciple was immediately shocked!

Even though his strength was weak, he could see that this old man in front of him was extraordinary!

Hence, he did not dare to say anything. He hurriedly ran back to the Heavenly Cloud sect, intending to report this matter to the sect leader! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

However, at this moment, Xiao Sheng had already taken a steady step towards the door.

At the door.

Many disciples of the Heavenly Cloud sect followed behind the sect leader and stood at the door.

That old man looked somewhat kind, but the smile on his face made people feel extremely uncomfortable.

“Xiao Sheng, long time no see,”the old man said faintly.

Xiao Sheng said with a faint smile, “Greetings, Uncle Jing.”

The old man who was called Uncle Jing immediately laughed and said, “Xiao Sheng, you are much more polite than before.”

Xiao Sheng said with a smile, “I’m old. Naturally, I’m not like before.”

Uncle Jing narrowed his eyes and said with a cold smile, “Are you old, or are you afraid?”
