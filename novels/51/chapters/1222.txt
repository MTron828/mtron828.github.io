Chapter 1223: Chapter 1,223, the list to kill Qin Yu 

“It was reserved?”Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Di zun whispered, “Yes, it was because of this that I had no choice but to deceive his array flags.”

“Thank you.”Qin Yu could not help but bow slightly to Di Zun.

As for who reserved the array flags, Qin Yu was not in a hurry to ask.

Without the eight array flags, these few array flags would be useless.

As for whether the entire Earth could find the eight array flags, it was hard to say. In the end, the two of them might choose to cooperate, so there was no need to spend a huge price to negotiate with them now.

“Then where is the Purple Jade Essence Snake?”Qin Yu asked.

Di zun said, “It’s in the island Lord’s Manor. It will be pulled out at eight o’clock every night to let people challenge it.”

“Okay, then there won’t be any problems.”Qin Yood up and said.

“Old Sir, please take your time to eat. I’ll take my leave first.”

With that, Qin Yu brought Di Zun and turned around to walk out of the small tavern.

After leaving, Di Zun took out the array flag and handed it to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu carefully sized it up. As expected, it was the teleportation array flag of the holy region.

“Thank you,”Qin Yid again.

Di Zun touched his nose and smiled embarrassedly. “Mr. Qin, what did you promise me before?”

Qin Yapped his head and then remembered this matter.

He sized up Di Zun in front of him. Because he didn’t have spiritual energy, Qin Yu couldn’t see his potential.

But no matter what, Qin Yu had already promised Di Zun. No matter how talented he was, he had to accept this disciple.

“Okay, I promise you.”Qin Yid with a smile.

Di Zun was instantly overjoyed and hurriedly said, “Thank you, Mr. Qin! Oh No, Master!”

It was the first time someone called him master. Qin Yu always felt strange, but he didn’t think too much about it.

When a person reached a certain level, there would always be someone who would come and take him as a master.

Many times, it was not his choice, but when he reached that position, he would have no choice but to branch out.

“By the way, what’s the origin of the Purple Jade origin snake?”Qin Yu asked.

Di zun said, “It’s said that this purple jade origin snake is a ferocious demon beast that the island Lord got from God knows where. It’s said to be a branch of an ancient strange beast. The island Lord raised it as a pet.”

“The purple jade origin snake’s entire body is full of poison and incomparably ferocious. Every person who challenged it rushed over like a flock of d, but in the end, they all died at the hands of the Purple Jade origin snake.”

Speaking up to this point, Di Zun paused for a moment and said mysteriously, “This purple jade origin snake’s entire body is filled with poison. Someone just touched its body and his entire body festered to death! Master, you have to be careful.”

Qin Yu touched his chin and muttered, “According to this, we can’t touch it at all...”

“More or less,”said Di Zun.

“This is also one of the reasons why it’s so difficult.”

Besides this qion, Qin Yu had another doubt.

Since the island owner treated the Purple Jade origin snake as his pet, he must have liked it very much.

If he killed it, who knew if the island owner would be angry out of humiliation.

“Forget it, I’ll just ignore him,”Qin Yu thought.

Since he was the one who issued the public challenge, the purple jade origin snake deserved to die.

If this island owner was really angry out of humiliation, Qin Yu was not afraid at all.

It was not an exaggeration to say that in the current era, Qin Yu was not afraid of anyone. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

...

The island was quite lively. Martial artists were looking for treasures in the underground market, while ordinary wealthy people were looking for fun.

Under the leadership of Di Zun, Qin Yu wandered around the underground market.

In this market, other than bartering, there were also people who were buying and selling other people’s lives.

And the price of the assassin was extremely high, at least starting from nine digits.

“Master, not long ago, someone publicly asked for your life, and the conditions were extremely outrageous,”Di Zun suddenly said.

Hearing this, Qin Yu was slightly surprised.

“Who is it?”Qin Yu asked, puzzled.

Di zun said, “I don’t know either, but in the end, no one dared to take the order.”

Qin Yu was not surprised. He did not know how many people he had offended over the years, and there were countless enemies in the open and in the dark.

Someone wanted to kill him, so he was used to it.

“Hey, this is the place.”As they spoke, the two of them arrived in front of a shop.

This shop was a shop that specialized in taking orders from assassins.

The buyer handed the money and information to the shop, and the shop was responsible for making it public, waiting for the assassins to come.

The shop took 10% of the transaction amount, which was considered fair.

The two of them walked into the shop. As soon as they entered, Di Zun pointed at a piece of information on the wall and said, “Master, look, it’s still there!”

Looking Up, as expected, Qin Ymessage was still open on the wall.

As for the conditions, besides money, there were also heavenly and earthly treasures.

Other than some uncommon herbs, there were also beast blood and other items that could not be named.

Qin Yu could not help but touch his chin and muttered, “There are not many people who can offer such conditions...”

“Boss, who is the buyer of this information?”Asked di Zun.

The boss glanced at di zun and said, “Protecting the privacy of the buyer is our basic principle. Don’t yoow that?”

Di Zun laughed embarrassedly and didn’t say anything more.

“Why? Do you want to take the order? This order has been hanging here for a long time, and the price is constantly rising,”said the boss.

Qin Yu waved his hand and smiled, “We are not interested. We are just looking around.”

After saying that, Qin Yu pulled Di Zun and prepared to go out.

At this moment, a young man suddenly walked in.

After he entered, he pointed at Qin Ymessage on the wall and said, “I will take this order.”

As soon as he said that, Qin Yu, who had intended to go out, immediately stopped in his tracks.
