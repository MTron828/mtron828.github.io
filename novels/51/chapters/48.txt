Chapter 49: Good-for-nothing? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

It was very easy for Yan Ruoxue to help someone. She could make Qin Yu a top businessman in Jiangcheng and even Chuzhou at the drop of a hat.

However, if Qin Yu wanted to make a name for himself in Jingdu, he had to have the ability.

Yan Ruoxue understood this very well, so what she wanted to do wasn’t to help Qin Yu remove obstacles, but to let Qin Yu grow under the premise of ensuring his safety.

The secretary at the side sighed slightly and whispered, “Love is really toxic... who would have thought that the famous Yan Ruoxue of Jingdu would fall head over heels in love in a remote town like Jiangcheng...”

...

Ever since Lei Hu released the news, everyone in Jiangcheng had been spreading it.

Other than relevant herbs manufacturers, even some powerful real estate developers wanted a piece of the pie.

Recently, Zhao Gang had been staying by Shen Yun’s side every day. He was a surprisingly loyal henchman.

“President Shen, what does Lei Hu mean by this? Why did he announce that he was choosing a partner?” Zhao Gang said as he poured water for Shen Yun.

Shen Yun glanced at him and said nonchalantly, “It is probably the intention of that old doctor. Big shots are all cocky because of their talent. I understand.”

Zhao Gang nodded and then said flatteringly, “That’s true. Who in Jiangcheng is more powerful than the Shen family?”

Shen Yun didn’t say anything, but his face couldn’t help but show an arrogant look.

“As long as the Yan family doesn’t participate, who will dare to compete with me, Shen Yun?” Shen Yun thought to himself.

Time flew by.

In the blink of an eye, it was the third day.

On this day, the entrance of No. 1 Grand Mansion was filled with luxury cars. Many wealthy businessmen were waiting there.

“Alas, if we had listened to Mr. Qin back then, we wouldn’t have to come here to compete!” Du Yuan couldn’t help but grumble.

Du Hengsheng couldn’t help but lament, “I originally thought that Qin Yu didn’t have any real talent. I didn’t expect... Alas, no wonder the Yan family supported him.”

The two of them regretted it, but it was too late.

In the hall, many businessmen were chattering in low voices. No one knew the background of this so-called old doctor.

At this moment, the venue suddenly quieted down.

Looking over, they saw Shen Yun and Zhao Gang walking in from outside.

Shen Yun’s arrival immediately made everyone feel crestfallen.

Everyone knew how powerful the Shen family was. Even in Chuzhou, they were top-notch, let alone Jiangcheng?

“President Shen, I didn’t expect you to come!” A businessman was the first to react and rushed over to curry favor with them.

Since Shen Yun was here, no one could compete with them.

Since they couldn’t compete, they might as well curry favor with Shen Yun and get the agency rights from Shen Yun!

Soon, these sly men all reacted and rushed up to greet him.

“Dad, should we go over?” Du Yuan asked.

Du Hengsheng shook his head and said, “Our relationship with the Shen family is too hostile. If we go over, we will only embarrass ourselves.”

“That’s true.” Du Yuan nodded, then smiled and said, “It seems that Shen Yun doesn’t know that the Soul Nourishment Pill came from Qin Yu.”

Faced with everyone’s flattery, Shen Yun appeared even more proud.

People like Shen Yun looked down on the businessmen of Jiangcheng.

In his eyes, the so-called successful people of Jiangcheng were at the bottom of the barrel and not worth mentioning.

However, to establish a foothold in Jiangcheng, he indeed needed a group of followers, so even though he looked down on this group of people, he still dealt with them one by one.

“Honey, you’re so amazing!” Su Yan couldn’t help but whisper as she followed Zhao Gang.

“As long as we curry favor with the Shen family, won’t we be rich in the future?” Su Yan’s eyes sparkled.

Zhao Gang said proudly, “Of course.”

At this moment, Zhao Gang suddenly saw Qin Yu walking in from outside.

The moment he saw Qin Yu, Zhao Gang’s expression instantly turned cold. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Why is he here?” Su Yan’s eyes flashed with disgust.

Zhao Gang snorted lightly and brought Su Yan towards Qin Yu.

“Yo, Qin Yu, you also want to participate in this business deal?” Zhao Gang said derisively.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said with a nonchalant smile, “Yes.”

Zhao Gang sneered as he said, “Qin Yu, do you think you can participate in this business just because you are close to Lei Hu?”

“Let me tell you, it’s impossible! This business was arranged by President Shen! President Shen calls the shots!”

At this point, Zhao Gang changed the topic and said with some pride, “But I’m different. I’ve already seized the opportunity to get close to President Shen!”

“Honey, you’re so impressive!” Su Yan immediately shouted in a flattering manner.

Then, Su Yan sized up Qin Yu and said derisively, “That’s why I said that this type of ability is innate. A good-for-nothing is nothing but a good-for-nothing. Even if you suck up to the Yan family, you’re still a good-for-nothing!”
