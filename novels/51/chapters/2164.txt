2165 The Endless Void

Qin Yu gritted his teeth with difficulty. He gathered all his strength on the divine robe of Wu Ji, trying to resist this dense pressure.

The light emitted by the divine robe of Wu Ji gradually grew brighter, forming a strong resistance against the dense internal qi. Qin Yu felt the cracks in his body eventually heal. His physical body began to condense again and become strong.

Nevertheless, the heavy pressure still made Qin Yu feel incomparably painful and depressed. He felt as if he was being pressed by a gigantic mountain, unable to breathe.

In this void, Qin Yu felt an immense danger. He knew that he had to find the source of life as soon as possible. He had to find a chance to escape from this desolate void.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and mobilized his true essence, gathering all his strength and attempting to break through the shackles of this void.

Qin Yu used mobilized his true essence with all his might. His divine robe emitted a dazzling light. He tried to use his greatest strength to break through the shackles of the void. He released waves of scorching light, hoping to tear the darkness apart.

However, no matter how hard he tried, the void seemed unmoved by his efforts. His power was like a drop of water falling into the sea in the void, so insignificant that it made people despair.

Qin Yu was unwilling to give up. He tried to use various methods. He released scorching flames to trigger powerful explosions, but the void swallowed everything. He tried to control time and space, but the void’s interference caused these powers to fail to operate steadily.

As time passed, Qin Yu’s efforts became more challenging, and his body began to show signs of fatigue. His eyes revealed determination and persistence, but at the same time, there was a hint of despair and bitterness.

He tried using his thoughts to open up the path and find the weakness of the void, but the void still could not be torn apart. Every attempt he made failed. He felt like he had fallen into an endless cycle with no way out.

Despair gradually spread as Qin Yu’s body began to tremble. He eventually exhausted his strength. The determination in his heart wavered, and he began to doubt his choice and determination.

However, just as he was about to give up, a glimmer of light flashed across his mind, barely maintaining his hope. He remembered what Xiao Sheng had once told him, “The key to the dao technique lies in finding inner peace and a condensed state of mind.”

Qin Yu slowed down his breathing and strived to calm the inner excitement and restlessness within.

“No matter what… I want to escape from this d*mned place!”

He closed his eyes and tried his best to immerse himself in his inner world, attempting to find a calm and condensed state of mind.

As time passed, Qin Yu gradually felt an internal qi of calmness.

His state of mind gradually settled as if he had returned to the beginning of his cultivation. He began to feel the power in his heart. It was a power that resisted the void.

Qin Yu opened his eyes once again as the state of mind in his mind condensed. His gaze was full of determination.

He mobilized his true essence again, but this time, it was no longer the power to show off but a gentle and firm power.

He concentrated his strength and gathered his true essence in his palms, forming a ball of blue light. His palm was warm and serene like a surge of inner strength was releasing at this moment.

Qin Yu’s gaze locked onto a weak spot in the void. Without hesitation, he reached out his hand and gently projected the ball of light.

The ball of light tore through the dark void, leaving behind a beautiful trail as it headed straight for the weak spot. A strange phenomenon occurred when the ball of light came into contact with the void.

The ball of light gradually disappeared, but a faint light appeared in the void, like the embers of a star. The faint light quickly spread out and gradually formed a crack.

Qin Yu’s eyes flashed with joy, knowing he had finally found a way to break through the void.

“There’s hope!” Qin Yu suppressed the excitement in his heart, but his body still trembled continuously because of the excitement!

Under this excitement, Qin Yu even forgot the pain of his body being suppressed. At this moment, the divine robe of Wu Ji also emitted an even more dazzling light as if it was cheering for him!

The terrifying and dense internal qi around him once again hit his face as if it wanted to press Qin Yu to the ground completely.

But now that he had hope, Qin Yu could not care less about the pain in his body.

He concentrated all his strength, instilled his true essence into his palms, and then pushed hard.

Qin Yu pushed the crack with all his might, hoping to break free completely from the shackles of the void.

However, the crack began to heal at a tremendous speed at this moment, and the surrounding internal qi became even denser, almost suffocating!

“How could this be?” Qin Yu’s eyes flashed with panic. He tried to tear open another crack with all his might, but this time, no matter how hard he tried, he could not tear open even half a crack in the void!

The surroundings were still full of endless cold darkness. Qin Yu tried repeatedly in despair, but no matter how, he could not open that crack again. The binding of the void became even stronger, and the dense internal qi almost crushed him completely.

Every attempt failed. Qin Yu’s strength gradually depleted. His body began to tremble, unable to withstand the pressure of the void anymore.

Despair enveloped his heart. He felt he could no longer escape this desolate void. Fatigue and disappointment filled his eyes, and despair replaced his determination and persistence.

“Why… Why can’t I break through the void!” Qin Yu roared, his voice filled with powerlessness and pain.

It was endless darkness in the surroundings, and he could not see anything clearly.

The dao technique here began to fade away. Qin Yu’s own dao techniques were also wiped out. Everything started to dissipate in an instant. What remained of Qin Yu seemed to be only his unique physique.

“Ah!”

Qin Yu was on the verge of collapse, and that pain began to strike him like it was tearing him apart!

Qin Yu clenched his fists tightly. Like a headless fly, he continuously swung his fists at the void. However, each time he punched out, there was nothing, nothing at all.

It was an endless void in which he could not touch anything. This cold despair was enough to shatter all of a person’s faith.

Qin Yu’s state of mind collapsed. He began to doubt his own strength and value.

After an unknown period of time, Qin Yu finally lost all his strength. He collapsed to the ground in despair, like a drunken man.

Qin Yu lay on the ground in the air, staring at the pitch-black sky above him with a helpless expression. His heart was full of despair.

“I… Am I going to be trapped here forever…” He mocked himself in a low voice, the despair in his heart could no longer be suppressed. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The dreams and faith he once had in the depths of his heart gradually shattered.

At this moment, Qin Yu felt how small and powerless he was. He could not contend with the void at all.
