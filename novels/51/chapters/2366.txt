“Borrowing Power from the Heavens.”

At this moment, the terrifying saber intent of the saber qi even split the space in half.

Qin Yu’s back faced Teng Zi Xu, and his divine sense firmly locked onto Qin Yu. If he made some slight movement, the slash of Borrowing Power from the Heavens would slash down without hesitation.

The insidious saber intent, penetrating his body right to the marrow, pointed sharply at his soul.

Qin Yu’s Glazed Holy Body emanated countless tiny traces of blood qi from his skin.

The blood vessels on the surface had been destroyed by the saber intent.

“Do it if you have the ability. Little b*stard, you want to elope with that whore of the Yan family? Where’s the dignity of the nine great aristocratic families?”

Ni Wuxiao had calmed down at this moment although he did not know how Teng Zixu had escaped the restraints of the Path of Heaven.

However, he knew that even if Qin Yu’s physical body was extremely powerful, he could not take this slash of Borrowing Power from the Heavens.

“I have already said that you will die today.”

Qin Yu’s voice was very calm as he suddenly threw a punch.

A unicorn roared out of Suo Lin, smashing Ni Wuxiao’s head into pieces before he could even react.

Teng Zixu looked furious and almost at the same time, the saber light had slashed onto his back.

The mountain-like internal qi suddenly pressed down, and the internal qi in the middle was compressed to the extreme and blew to both sides.

The mountains and forests of the entire continent were instantly leveled by the violent hurricane.

The moment the saber qi was about to cut Qin Yu’s body, the space suddenly tilted as if it was distorted.

After that, the second level, the third layer, and in an instant, a thousand layers of space formed on Qin Yu’s back.

The saber moved forward at an extremely slow speed. In an instant, up to a hundred levels of space were shattered.

Then more spaces were formed after that.

The Way of Spatial Rules rose from Qin Yu’s hands, and he clapped his hands suddenly.

It was a move he had comprehended after he sailed in the Sea of Spatial Rules where his body fully absorbed pure spatial energy and then used his desolate divine eye to observe the rules.

The saber was only an inch away from his body, but it seemed to be separated from countless distant worlds.

Teng Zixu’s eyes narrowed slightly, and his body once again emanated an aura as vast as the sea.

That aura once again soared at a terrifying speed. It only slowly stopped when a strange phenomenon appeared in the Path of Heaven.

A thousand layers of space were instantly shattered, and the saber landed on Qin Yu’s back.

A terrifying wound instantly appeared, but it was forcefully clamped by Qin Yu’s skin and could no longer advance.

Following that, he swept up Jue Wu, Elder Guai, and Chang Mang, and threw a punch at the Yun family elder.

The Yun family elder’s face was full of shock. The energy of the Heaven-sealing Orb suddenly shrunk and protected his true body.

Qin Yu crashed into him fiercely, but it was indeed an afterimage. The spatial power in his body erupted and he had already disappeared into the depths of the void, disappearing before everyone’s eyes.

Only Ni Wuxiao’s body was left behind, along with the people of the Hoy Region who were looking at each other in dismay.

It was deadly silent.

They had already mobilized their strongest force other than the Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivators to kill Qin Yu.

However, he killed the First Elder of the Ni family in front of everyone and then escaped. With such a battle achievement, no one knew what shockwaves it would create if it fell into the Holy Region.

Yao Xi stared at Ni Wuxiao’s corpse with a pale face. He would probably be the corpse now if Qin Yu had targeted him just now.

“Let’s go back. We can’t do anything to him anymore. We can only wait for the Golden Path of Heaven to descend and capture him.”

Teng Zi Xu sighed with emotion and said. He had already used his extreme strength and even borrowed the power of the heavens to break through his limit, but he could only cause injuries to Qin Yu.

Under the suppression of the power of the current Path of Heaven, the Holy Region was destined to fail to control Qin Yu.

“Let’s go back and set up first. However, the good thing is that he can’t obtain the Xuanyuan Sword for now. When the Golden Path of Heaven descends, we’ll kill him with the power of thunder.”

Yan Yunfan’s expression was also unsightly. He left after saying that.

Initially, Yao Xi did not have any achievements at all before this, so he deliberately left behind solemn promises in front of the aristocratic families.

If he were to go back now, he would probably become the laughingstock of everyone.

He could only go back and retreat for now. Only when the Golden Path of Heaven descended and he could soar into the sky that he could wash away this humiliation.

…

In the Mysterious Dark Sect, Hua Tian suddenly opened his eyes.

“The people from the Holy Region have failed again. This Qin Yu is indeed a great Son of Cosmic Luck.”

Hua Tian said solemnly.

“It can’t be, right? The Holy Region paid such a huge price this time, so they must have gone all out. How could they let Qin Yu escape?” Nangong Qi was also shocked.

“It’s a pity that I only went out once because I was afraid of the strength of the woman beside him. Otherwise, that would have been the best opportunity.”

Hua Tian sighed softly. Previously, he suddenly attacked Qin Yu with the Fist of the Great Expansion Divine Technique at the last moment and severely injured him.

However, Jue Wu had always been by Qin Yu’s side, so he dared not descend with his true body and missed a chance to kill Qin Yu.

“But it doesn’t matter. I wouldn’t survive until today if I didn’t play safe. I’ve fused the Five Emperor Coins into my body, and the power of the Great Expansion Divine Technique has increased fivefold. Qin Yu is completely under my control now.”

Hua Tian was just being emotional slightly before he calmed down. A massive compass was then spinning non-stop in front of him.

After processing the massive amount of information, it returned to his sea of consciousness.

“Decline comes with prosperity. Even a great Son of Cosmic Luck can’t always have such luck. It should be the time now. The next time will be my turn to go all out.”

Hua Tian seemed to have received some information, and a mysterious smile appeared on his face.

…

At this moment, Qin Yu’s Sumeru ring had turned into a grain of sand. He controlled the Sumeru ring to continuously shuttle through space. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Now that Hua Tian could sense his internal qi, it was best that he kept moving and changing positions.

Moreover, this consumption was almost negligible with Qin Yu’s current Glazed Holy Body.

Now, every cell of his could accommodate a vast amount of spiritual energy. The surrounding vital energy was completely devoured between movements and breaths, even if he did not circulate the Traceless Immortal Scripture.

This was the terrifying power of the chaotic body and Glazed Holy Body.

There was an enormous wound on Qin Yu’s back. Even if the slash of Borrowing Power from the Heavens did not surpass Yun Zhilan’s attack, it was not much different. If it was not for the fact that he had comprehended the Singularity Space while sailing in the Sea of Space, this slash might have killed him directly.

The vital energy of heaven and earth continued flowing into his body, and the wound on his back healed rapidly.
