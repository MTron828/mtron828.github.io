1898 Saintess Gu Follows

Qin Yu was not angry facing the mockeries by all.

He swept his gaze across the crowd and said in a deep voice, “Of course, you can choose not to believe it. However, I can tell you responsibly that these two Masters of Path of Heaven don’t have much confidence in their deductions.

At this point, Qin Yu glanced at the two Masters of Path of Heaven and said slowly, “Am I right?”

An unnatural look flashed across their faces. Just as Qin Yu had said, they did not have much confidence in their choice of path.

!!

However, under the current circumstances, they would never admit it even if they did not have the confidence.

“Nonsense, you’re full of nonsense. How can a rascal like you understand our deduction of the Path of Heaven?” one of the Masters of Path of Heaven shouted.

“Hehe! Saintess Gu, Young Masters, do you believe his words?” another Master of Path of Heaven chimed in.

Yan Yunfan, who was standing at the side, looked annoyed. He said coldly, “Why should we listen to his nonsense? Don’t waste time!”

After speaking, Yan Yunfan signaled the two Masters of Path of Heaven to lead the way.

Si Shifeng, at the side, said indifferently, “You’re in the limelight like a clown. You simply make us laugh our heads off.”

Seeing them about to take the wrong path, Qin Yu knew he could not stop them.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly blocked Saintess Gu’s way.

A trace of surprise flashed across Santess Gu’s beautiful eyes. She looked at Qin Yu and said, “Mr. Qin, what’s the matter?”

“Please believe me for once, Saintess Gu,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Saintess Gu’s beautiful eyes rolled, and the puzzlement in her eyes grew even more intense.

“Why should I believe you?” she smiled and said. “What makes you worthy of my trust?”

Of course, Qin Yu knew it was impossible to convince Saintess Gu with just a few words.

However, Saint Gu was a righteous person. She was much better than the two persons from the Yan family and the Si family.

Qin Yu thought for a while and continued, “Saintess Gu, do you know Gu Sanchen?”

“Gu Sanchen?” Saintess Gu was a little surprised, but she nodded and said, “He’s from my Gu family, but so what?”

Qin Yu’s mouth was agape as Gu Sanchen’s words came to his mind.

Although he was a member of the Gu family, his status was not high. Naturally, he could not be compared to Saintess Gu, heaven’s favorite. Qin Yu was afraid that he did not carry enough weight.

“Forget it,” thinking of this, Qin Yu waved his hand and said.

Saintess Gu smiled and said nothing else. She continued to walk down the path.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of someone, the man with the mustache.

“D*mn it! I’m really sorry. I have to betray you.” Qin Yu gritted his teeth.

He thus blocked Sanintess Gu’s way again.

“Mr. Qin, please don’t take up too much of my time,” Saint Gu said with a hint of displeasure.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said softly, “I wonder if Saintess Gu is acquainted with this person. I… I don’t know his name but I only know he has a mustache and a bad reputation in the Holy Region…”

At the mention of the man with the mustache, a strange look flashed across Saintess Gu’s face. Saintess Gu, who had always been graceful and unrestrained, had a very interesting expression on her face.

She pouted a little, her face blushed, and there was a trace of anger in her eyes. In the end, all her expressions disappeared and were replaced by a trace of coldness. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Saintess Gu looked at Qin Yu with vague killing intent and said coldly, “What? Are you his friend? Where is he now?”

Seeing the change in Saintess Gu’s expression, Qin Yu knew something was wrong!

D*mn it! What did this man with the mustache do to make Saintess Gu so angry?

“No! No! No! I’m not his friend. Otherwise, how would I not know his name?” Qin Yu quickly explained.

“The man with the mustache is his nickname,” Saintess Gu said coldly.

Hearing this, Qin Yu became even more panicked. He quickly explained, “I’m really not familiar with him. I’ve only heard him mention this sanctum by chance…”

Saintess Gu’s expression turned even colder, and her killing intent rose.

If not for the fact that they were in the depths of the sanctum, Saintess Gu would have already made her move.

She took a deep breath, her chest trembling slightly.

After a while, Saintess Gu said coldly, “If you have a chance to meet him, please remember to pass a message to him. If I happen to see him one day, I’ll definitely tear him into a thousand pieces!”

After saying this, Saintess Gu turned around and left.

“Wait a moment!”

Qin Yu called out to Saintess Gu again.

Saintess Gu suppressed her anger and said, “Before I change my mind, you’d better disappear from my sight,”

Qin Yu was not in a hurry. He smiled and said, “This man with the mustache might not be a good person, but I think he’s undoubtedly capable. I’m afraid his deduction of the Path of Heaven is above those two Masters of Path of Heaven.

“You should know he would be here for sure. However, he didn’t come because he was afraid you would come after him. That’s why he came to work with me. He let me bring the results of his deduction and come to take away the treasures of this sanctum.”

After hearing what Qin Yu said, Saintess Gu didn’t say anything for a while as if she had been persuaded by Qin Yu.

Qin Yu struck while the iron was hot and continued, “I just don’t want to owe you a favor since you’ve helped me out so many times.”

Qin Yu paused for a moment and continued, “Even if you want to follow them now, I’m afraid it’s too late.”

As expected, Yan Yunfan and the others had long disappeared without a trace.

Saintess Gu’s face was gloomy. After a while, she said coldly, “If you dare to lie to me, I will not let you off.”

“Don’t worry. There’s no point lying to you,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

After he finished speaking, he made an inviting gesture.

...

Qin Yu spread his hands and immediately stepped into the other path.

Two of them walked the path carefully. Qin Yu avoided all the killing formations with Saintess Gu by using the map in his mind.

After moving forward for a long time, the darkness began to slowly disappear, and the dense killing intent also slowly dissipated at this moment.

When the clouds and fog were cleared, everything seemed to become clear, and the irregular killing formations also slowly disappeared.

Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief. He turned to Saintess Gu and said with a smile, “Saintess Gu, how is it? I didn’t lie to you, did I?”

“It can’t prove anything now,” Saintess Gu said quietly.

Qin Yu didn’t waste time. According to the map, there were no more dangers ahead, and everything would be smooth sailing now.

“What will happen if I take the wrong path?” Saintess Gu suddenly asked.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment before he said, “That will depend on their abilities. Anyway… It’s full of danger.”

Hearing this, Saint Gu looked worried.
