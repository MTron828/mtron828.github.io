Chapter 428: All Of You Shall Attack Together! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Even though that was the case, no one dared to take the first step.

They were afraid that Qin Yu was faking it, and were afraid that they would be smacked to death by Qin Yu.

The cold gazes around them grew, and countless people were getting restless.

However, Qin Yu didn’t pay any attention to them and continued walking on the Divine Dragon Street.

“Sir, you must be Qin Yu.”

Finally, someone stepped forward.

The one who spoke was a young man with a platinum necklace on his neck and seven to eight rings on his hand.

Qin Yu glanced at him and asked, “Who are you?”

“Don’t worry about who I am. I heard that not only did you destroy their relationship, but you also killed the old master of the Yan family. Is that true?” The young man asked with a smile.

Qin Yu sneered. “Just say what you want to say.”

“It’s nothing. I just feel that you should be ashamed of your behavior.” The young man snorted.

“Yes! You are an ingrate!”

“You benefited from the Yan family, but betrayed the Yan family. You are a scum!”

“You do whatever you want because you have some ability! No matter how strong you are, it’s useless if you’re immoral!”

Everyone began to curse at Qin Yu angrily.

At this moment, Qin Yu spat out another mouthful of blood from his mouth, and his face turned a little pale.

“What? Are you so angry that you spat out blood?”

“Haha, this is retribution!”

An old man walked out.

He stood beside Qin Yu and said with a benevolent expression, “Young man, let me give you a piece of advice. It doesn’t matter if you’ve done something wrong, but you must learn to admit your mistake. It’s never too late to repent.”

Qin Yu sized up the old man and said, “Then how do you think I should admit my mistakes?”

The old man smiled nonchalantly and said, “Your power was bestowed by the Yan family. As long as you pay it back, you’ll be able to atone for your sins.”

Qin Yu immediately sneered.

He looked at the old man coldly and said, “Old man, don’t put on airs.”

The old man’s expression changed and he said unhappily, “I’m advising you out of kindness. Why don’t you know what’s good for you?”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “There’s no shortage of people like you in society. You look friendly, but in fact, you’re exacerbating the conflict. Why are you pretending to be a good person?”

“You’re just a person who tramples those weaker and kisses up to those more powerful. You just want to show off. Do you think that because you’re old, I have to listen to you?”

“Old man, where did you come from? Get lost!”

His words instantly made the old man’s face turn ashen.

“Qin Yu, aren’t you being too arrogant?!” Someone berated.

Qin Yu looked at him coldly and said, “Don’t pretend to be kind. You’re clearly doing this for your own selfish interests, yet you’re trying to act like you’re doing it in the name of justice. Do you really think you’re a righteous person?”

“When I openly challenged the Yan family, all of you were like maggots in the corner and didn’t dare to say a word.”

“Now, when you see that I’m injured, you come out to act all high and mighty. What kind of people are you?”

After he finished his words, the crowd was completely silent.

“Well said!” Only Taozi clapped.

Qin Yu glanced at the crowd and said coldly, “If you want to fight, then go ahead. I’m standing here. Don’t you want to be a warrior? Then don’t be like a keyboard warrior who only knows how to hide in the crowd.”

After saying that, Qin Yu closed his eyes and quietly waited.

“Just now, he admitted that his body was injured. What’s there to be afraid of?!”

“Right, for the sake of fairness and justice, we must teach him a lesson!”

Everyone was eager to make a move, but no one dared to take even half a step forward.

“You two, go beat him up!” At this time, the young man with the platinum necklace pointed at the two bodyguards beside him and shouted.

The bodyguards nodded and immediately walked towards Qin Yu!

These two bodyguards were both at the Inner Strength Past Master realm, and their strength wasn’t ordinary. They were extremely swift, and they grabbed at Qin Yu’s face! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Bang!”

However, Qin Yu waved his hand, and his palm instantly slapped onto the two bodyguards’ chests!

“Swoosh!”

The bodies of the two bodyguards were instantly sent flying, and they slammed into the wall with their mouths bleeding non-stop!

The crowd instantly fell into silence, and some people even subconsciously took two steps back.

What was going on? Wasn’t Qin Yu’s strength greatly reduced after his body was injured? Why did he still have such terrifying strength?

Could it be fake?

Qin Yu put his hands behind his back and said coldly, “Even if my strength is injured, I’m not someone ants like Inner Strength Past Masters can bully.”

A mere Inner Strength Past Master wasn’t worthy of Qin Yu’s attention.

“Don’t forget, Qin Yu’s physical body is unparalleled in the world.” At this moment, someone said in the dark.

“Even if he is injured, his physical body is still the same. A mere Inner Strength Past Master, let alone killing him, can’t even break through his defense.”

Everyone suddenly understood.

Yes, even if Qin Yu didn’t have any inner strength, his physical body was still powerful.

An ordinary Inner Strength Past Master couldn’t hurt him.

“You know a lot.” Qin Yu looked in a certain direction coldly.

“Hehe, Mr. Qin is revered as the King of Chuzhou, but now, he is running rampant on this small street. Aren’t you afraid of people gossiping?” A middle-aged man walked out from the dark.

“That’s right, bullying the weak isn’t gentlemanly.” Then, another person walked out!

“How can Mr. Qin bully the weak like this? Even I can’t stand it anymore.” A seductive woman followed closely behind.

Three Inner Strength Grandmasters!

The three Inner Strength Grandmasters of Divine Dragon Street finally came out!

Waves of powerful internal qi spread throughout Divine Dragon Street.

The people around, afraid of being affected, subconsciously stepped back.

“I have always regarded you as my idol. But I didn’t expect you to bully the weak in the Divine Dragon Street,” an Inner Strength Grandmaster said with a nonchalant smile.

“So what? Does it have anything to do with me?” Qin Yu sneered.

“How can Mr. Qin say such words? I’ve always wanted to find a husband like Mr. Qin, but Mr. Qin’s performance today has disappointed me,” the seductive woman pretended to wipe away her tears.

Qin Yu looked at her and sneered. “Do you think you are worthy? You look so promiscuous, yet you’re pretending to be prudish? Ugly thing.”

Anger flashed across Xiaoru’s face, and a murderous look appeared in her eyes.

“Qin Yu, no need to say more nonsense. You have aroused the anger of the public, so die!” The three of them stepped forward, and the internal qi of Inner Strength Grandmasters burst out at this moment.

Many people were unable to withstand this pressure. Some even vomited blood on the spot.

The killing intent spread throughout the entire Divine Dragon Street, and a great battle was about to break out.

Qin Yu’s face still showed no fear. He said coldly, “Make your move. There’s no need to say any more nonsense.”

“Alright, then I’ll satisfy you!” Finally, someone took the lead and took a step forward! He raised his hand and used his killing move!

The internal qi turned into thousands of sharp blades and shot towards Qin Yu!

“The three of you can attack me together. I, Qin Yu, have nothing to fear!” Qin Yu shouted as his hair flapped around wildly in the wind. He used his bare fists to face the attack head-on!

“How could I, Xiao Ru, miss out on this chance to uphold justice?”

The coquettish woman also cast a spell. She gently tapped the folding fan in her hand forward, and a sharp gust of wind suddenly whistled through the air!
