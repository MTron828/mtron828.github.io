Chapter 2664: Molou Shura

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

It was the founder of Buddhism, and anyone practicing Buddhism had to show it reverence.

However, he hadn’t anticipated that after being suppressed and freed, a younger member of the Buddhists would dare to confront him like this. It filled him with intense anger.

The air around Hua Tian seemed to boil, centered around the Evil Buddha’s feet.

The soil around his feet continued to churn, emitting waves of charred odor.

The feathers atop Molou Shura’s eagle head bristled, and an ominous sense of oppression descended from the dark sky.

The scorched earth at the periphery was drawn upwards by powerful gravity, forming a cage of burnt ground.

Within the dense clouds, lightning crackled.

The pure land quaked with thunder.

The floating Buddha statue descended abruptly before Hua Tian.

Its six arms extended, and a furious fist was unleashed in an instant.

As the six fists struck, a massive explosion followed the lightning, shattering the scorched earth cage.

The dense lightning power pierced through, causing the ground to tremble.

A potent divine might radiated from the Buddha statue, immobilizing Hua Tian completely.

“Hahahaha, even the founder of Buddhism is no match. From the looks of it, your strength seems rather ordinary.”

Hua Tian laughed maniacally. “Great Expansion Divine Technique, transform once more.”

The number of Great Expansion is fifty-five, and its use is forty-nine. Divide it into two to symbolize two, hang one to symbolize three, add four to symbolize four seasons, and return to Qi to symbolize leap.

The number of Great Expansion was fifty-five, and its use was forty-nine. It was divided into two to symbolize two, with one hanging to symbolize three, and four being manipulated to symbolize the four seasons, returning to Qi to symbolize the leap year.

There were two hundred and sixteen strategies for Qian, and one hundred and forty-four for Kun, totaling three hundred and sixty, which represented the days of the stage. The strategies in the two volumes amounted to fifteen hundred and twenty, representing the myriad things. Therefore, with the formation of the four camps, the Book of Changes was completed, and with the eighteen changes, the hexagrams were formed. Using the eight trigrams, one could achieve small accomplishments, draw out and extend them, draw analogies, and expand them, thus completing all tasks in the world.

He completely repelled the power of the Hell Shaking Thunder. The activation of the Great Expansion Divine Technique was merely a thought from Hua Tian, despite his strength not matching that of the Molou Shura.

Although his body’s power was suppressed by divine might, the Great Expansion Divine Technique remained unaffected.

As the power surged, Hua Tian’s body was cloaked in divine radiance. The power of the Saint Kingdom surged forth, directly assaulting Molou Shura.

Boom!

The tremendous force pierced through his body, causing his internal qi to roil violently.

The Buddha statue in the sky shattered violently under the impact, indicating significant damage.

“The power of the Saint Kingdom! You possess the Heart of a Saint Kingdom!”

Molou Shura’s face contorted in rage. Having endured the intrusion of Saint Power for an extended period in the Ancient Demon Land, his true form had been assimilated by nearly ninety percent.

In other words, he was almost like a native, heavily suppressed by the power of the Saint Kingdom.

He was gravely wounded by this attack.

“Go to hell!”

Hua Tian spun his body once, and the golden light of the Great Expansion Divine Technique that enveloped him slowly dissipated.

On Molou Shura’s back, the fifty-five hexagrams began to take shape slowly.

With forty-nine movements, these hexagrams formed a divination sword.

As the sword formed, the power of the hexagrams erupted from its sword.

Suddenly, a cloud of blood mist burst forth from Molou Shura’s body, and 49 chunks of flesh fell to the ground.

Molou Shura was dead!

“What a terrifying killing power. This is much more powerful than the Fist of the Great Expansion Divine Technique!”

Despite having endured a heavy blow from the power of the Saint Kingdom,

Molou Shura’s current strength still stood at the upper echelons of True Consciousness. It was highly surprising that he had been chopped into pieces like this.

“Hahahaha, it seems that the Great Expansion Divine Technique is much more potent after being nourished by the Saint Power of this world. The source of this power originally belongs to the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom, so its full potential can only be unleashed here.”

Hua Tian slapped his belly hard, unable to contain the smile on his face.

Not only had he obtained numerous fortuitous encounters in this land of providence, but his spiritual clarity had also deepened here, allowing him to further comprehend the power of the Great Expansion Divine Technique. Many previously obscure aspects had improved again during these nearly ten days of battle.

His utilization of the Great Expansion Divine Technique was no longer confined to just the Fist of the Great Expansion Divine Technique.

Various transformations were wielded in his hands, not only participating in defense but also introducing new offensive methods.

“Hahaha, who can stop me now?”

Hua Tian picked up Molou Shura’s prayer beads and suddenly burst into laughter.

Hahahahaha.

A deep voice sounded beside him, causing a trace of shock to flash across Hua Tian’s face.

He hadn’t sensed someone approaching him so closely. Less than ten meters in front of him, a black lotus slowly rotated, and a figure cloaked in black robes emerged from within.

“What a peculiar technique. Is this black lotus a Dharma Treasure? I couldn’t sense any internal qi from him at all,” Hua Tian remarked, staring greedily at the black lotus.

“The power of this Dharma Treasure is indeed formidable,” Wu Tian said with a smile. “Come and claim it if you desire.”

Hua Tian’s eyes flickered, and his stomach rumbled slightly.

The next moment, the Heart of the Saint Kingdom appeared in his hand. He blew out a large breath.

The mighty power of the Saint Kingdom crashed into Wu Tian like a tidal wave. The terrifying Saint Power wrapped him up completely with a tremendous divine might power. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Wu Tian narrowed his eyes. In an instant, the power was fully absorbed into his body.

“What pure energy. It surpasses the turbid qo of this place,” Wu Tian remarked softly as the black lotus in his hand began to burn with black fire.

“What’s this? The power of the Saint Kingdom is ineffective against him. Didn’t he suppress it for so long? Could it be that his body hasn’t assimilated at all?” Hua Tian exclaimed in shock.

Having just slain Molou Shura, Hua Tian attributed much of the credit to the power of the Saint Kingdom. However, Wu Tian appeared completely immune to its effects, even absorbing its power into his body.

Great Expansion Divine Technique, divination sword.

The trigrams continued to form in the air, gradually shaping into a colossal divination sword.

Black Lotus Fire.

A breath of black fire emanated from the black lotus, descending upon the air
