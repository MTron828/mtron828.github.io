Chapter 648: Public Execution of Yan Ruoxue! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Xia Hang’s face was pale. He couldn’t believe that these words came out of Qu Xie’s mouth!

Qu Xie seemed to have seen through Xia Hang’s thoughts. He said indifferently, “Do you know why Qin Yu lost? It’s because he has a weakness! And his weakness is Yan Ruoxue!”

“Otherwise, with his talent, if he worked hard for more than ten years, we really won’t be able to do anything to him.”

“Xia Hang, as the vice president, you should understand this principle.”

Xia Hang’s expression was extremely unsightly, and he laughed bitterly to himself.

As expected, what Qin Yu said was right.

“President Qu, I won’t give up on my daughter,” Xia Hang climbed up from the ground and said in a low voice.

Qu Xie snorted coldly. “Then you should think of a way yourself. The Jingdu Martial Arts Association definitely won’t help you!”

Xia Hang opened his mouth and wanted to say something, but Qu Xie rudely interrupted him.

“Get out!” Qu Xie waved his hand.

Xia Hang didn’t say anything more. With a bitter smile on his face, he turned around and left.

...

On the other side, Qin Yu’s injuries hadn’t fully recovered.

This battle had seriously injured Qin Yu. At the same time, he also knew how terrifying the Jingdu Martial Arts Association was.

Not only did they have extremely strong combat strength, but most importantly, they could make different battle plans according to different opponents.

“No wonder so many people were in that prison...” Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said in a low voice.

During this period of time, Qin Yu could no longer move. He just needed to stay here for the time being.

“I hope the man with the mustache can come back soon,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

As long as they could activate the two male corpses, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association wasn’t worth mentioning.

Even if they used the Martial Saint weapon, they wouldn’t be able to retaliate at all!

At night.

Qin Yu once again came to Xia Hang’s home while quietly waiting for Xia Hang’s return.

“How is it?” After Xia Hang returned, Qin Yu asked indifferently.

Xia Hang opened his mouth without knowing what to say for a moment.

Qin Yu sneered. “You don’t have to speak, I know the result.”

Xia Hang laughed bitterly and said, “I have worked hard for the Jingdu Martial Arts Association for so many years. I didn’t expect...”

“Xia Hang, as the vice president of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, I didn’t expect you to be so childish.” Qin Yu snorted.

“You want to talk about feelings with capitalists? To them, the only criterion is whether people are useful or not.”

Xia Hang sighed. He sat opposite Qin Yu and took a deep drag on his cigarette.

Qin Yu said calmly, “According to the agreement, you must listen to me now.”

Xia Hang glanced at Qin Yu and said, “I think I have lost Qu Xie’s trust. I can’t help you much.”

“That isn’t something you should consider. I will think of a way to win back Qu Xie’s trust in you,” Qin Yu stood up and said.

Xia Hang frowned and asked, “What do you want to do?”

“I naturally have my own way. When I need you, I’ll inform you,” Qin Yu said.

“Xia Hang, I hope you’ll keep your word. If you betray me again, I won’t be soft-hearted,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Xia Hang smiled bitterly. At this moment, how could he have a choice?

Qin Yu didn’t stay any longer and turned around to leave.

...

In the next few days, Qin Yu hid in the room and didn’t leave. He slowly healed his wounds.

The outside world’s guesses about the black-robed man’s identity had increased.

In the end, all the guesses reached a consensus.

That was: the black-robed man was the mentor behind Qin Yu! This attack was to avenge Qin Yu!

This conclusion was accepted by almost everyone!

“No wonder Qin Yu improved so fast. He actually has such a powerful mentor behind him.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“The mentor and disciple really have the same temper. They are both fearless powerhouses.”

“This mentor is obviously better. He has made the Jingdu Martial Arts Association suffer many times, but the Jingdu Martial Arts Association is helpless against him.”

As he looked at the comments on the Internet, Qu Xie’s expression became increasingly gloomy.

The higher-ups had already given the final order to Qu Xie: the black-robed man must be brought back within three days! Otherwise, Qu Xie’s position as President would be revoked!

This made Qu Xie even more anxious.

“It seems that we can only use that method.” Qu Xie’s eyes turned cold. Then, he got up and rushed straight to the Yan family.

In the center of Jingdu, there was a skyscraper.

It was said that the price of this skyscraper’s real estate was ridiculously high, as high as 300,000 yuan per square meter!

And this skyscraper was the Yan Group!

In an office on the top floor, there were four hot women in front of Yan Sihai.

These women all had gorgeous looks, sexy bodies, and there were even some B-list and C-list celebrities!

At this moment, these women were kneeling in front of Yan Sihai and serving him.

At this moment, Qu Xie walked in from outside.

“President Yan,” Qu Xie said politely.

Yan Sihai glanced at him and said generously, “Have a seat.”

Then, Yan Sihai waved at the four women and said, “You all can leave first.”

“Yes, President Yan.” The women stood up and left the office.

After they left, Yan Sihai asked casually, “President Qu, what do you want from me?”

Qu Xie was silent for a moment, then he told Yan Sihai his purpose for coming here.

After hearing that, Yan Sihai’s expression turned cold and he said, “Publicly execute Yan Ruoxue? Qu Xie, are you crazy? Do you want to make the Yan family lose face?”

Qu Xie had already guessed Yan Sihai’s attitude. He smiled bitterly and said, “President Yan, I don’t have any other way. As long as you agree, I can agree to any condition of yours!”

Yan Sihai snorted and said, “Qu Xie, I think you are crazy! I can’t agree to this!”

Qu Xie’s expression turned ugly. He thought for a moment and said, “How about this? We can narrow the range and limit this public punishment to the martial arts world!”

“This way, we can minimize the losses of the Yan family! What do you think?”

Yan Sihai said angrily, “Qu Xie! Don’t you understand what I’m saying? I told you, I can’t agree to this!”

“No matter what, Yan Ruoxue is my niece. Public execution? You are basically slapping my face!”

Qu Xie didn’t know what to do. This was the only way he could think of.

“How about this?” At this moment, Yan Jinyao walked in.

“Young Master Yan.” Qu Xie politely greeted Yan Jinyao.

Yan Jinyao nodded and said, “Change the public execution to the public extraction of blood. Don’t you have a list of names? Limit the number of people to those on this list.”

“Invite the young masters of the big families to come and visit.”

“In front of so many people, we’ll openly absorb Yan Ruoxue’s blood and distribute it to the young masters of the big families.”

“This seems more reasonable at least.”

Qu Xie’s expression was cold. Yan Jinyao’s words seemed to make some sense.

“That black-robed man isn’t a fool. Publicly executing Yan Ruoxue? The Jingdu Martial Arts Association regards her as a treasure. Why would they execute her? Even a fool can see that it’s a ruse.” Yan Jinyao snorted.

Qu Xie hurriedly nodded. “Young Master Yan’s words make sense!”
