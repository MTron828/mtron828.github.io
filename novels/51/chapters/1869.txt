1870 A Semi-Saint

This aura seemed to freeze everything in the surroundings. The entire world seemed to have stopped at this moment!

Qin Yu’s pupils suddenly dilated, and his face suddenly turned extremely ugly!

He could feel traces of Holy Power from the old man, and the wisps of internal qi that rippled out seemed to have the power to destroy the world!

Qin Yu couldn’t help but take two steps back, feeling extremely uneasy.

He did not expect the Tong family to have a True Saint!

“Ancestor, the clan is in trouble. Please help us.” Tong Lianyang knelt on the ground and said respectfully.

The old man looked in the direction of Tong Lianyang and then glanced at the current Tong family. He couldn’t help but exclaim, “It seems like the Tong family has come to this point…”

“It’s this Junior’s incompetence…” Said Tong Lianyang in a pained voice.

The old man waved his hand and said indifferently, “Forget it, forget it. Nothing is eternal.”

Then, the old man looked in Qin Yu’s direction.

“It’s you who brought people to the Tong residence?” The old man said.

Qin Yu had wanted to reason with him, so she cupped her hands and said, “Senior, it was the Tong family who didn’t want to let me go and hurt my friend. I had no choice.”

“You don’t have to tell me this,” the old man said indifferently. “I just want to know if you’re the one who caused the Tong family’s current situation.”

Hearing the old man’s words, Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse in his heart.

As expected, this old bastard wasn’t a good person.

So, Qin Yu raised his head and said, “Yes, I did it, but…”

“That’s enough.” The old man’s tone turned cold.

Qin Yu was immediately filled with anger.

Damn it, this old thing was really overbearing!

However, he was indeed powerful, and Qin Yu couldn’t compare to him.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu tried to ask, “Senior, if I may be so bold as to ask, are you in the True Saint realm?”

“Although I can’t see the True Saint realm, I’m almost there,” the old man said indifferently.

Hearing this, Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief.

Damn it, he had not even stepped into the True Saint realm and he was already acting so arrogantly. If he were to successfully step into the True Saint realm, he did not know what he would look like.

At this moment, Chang Mang, the peak master, and the others also arrived before Qin Yu.

The peak master took a step forward, cupped his hands, and said, “Senior, we are from Thunder Courtyard.”

“Thunder Courtyard?”

Hearing this, the old man’s expression became unnatural. He subconsciously looked at Tong Lianyang.

“Old ancestor, this has nothing to do with Thunder Courtyard. They are only from Demon-slaying Peak,” said Tong Lianyang hurriedly.

“Demon-slaying Peak? That’s good.” The old man heaved a sigh of relief.

Since it was not the Thunder Courtyard’s army, there was nothing to worry about.

“Senior, the Tong family is suspected of doing…”

“Alright, there’s no need to say anymore. Since you’re here, you can all stay.” The old man once again interrupted the peak master’s words in an overbearing manner.

Chang Mang, who was standing at the side, couldn’t hold it in any longer. He pointed at the old man and scolded, “You old thing, can’t you let me finish? Aren’t you just a Semi-Saint? A dead Semi-Saint? Are you pretending to be a True Saint? Why are you asking us to stay? Are you asking us to stay to bury you?”

Upon hearing Chang Mang’s vulgar words, an extremely terrifying aura instantly emanated from the old man’s body!

Under this aura, everyone was forced to take a few steps back. Chang Mang, who was the first to be hit, even vomited blood from the impact!

He wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and pointed at the old man, “Old man, just you wait. I’ll dig up your ancestral grave in a while…”

“You’re looking for death!”

The old man was completely enraged by Chang Mang. With a wave of his hand, a terrifying aura gushed out!

Although he was only a Semi-Saint, his strength was not something a Reversion Void Stage cultivator could compare to!

The vast energy contained a destructive force that destroyed everything in its path. Even the void exploded!

Qin Yu naturally couldn’t let Chang Mang bear it alone. At this moment, it was useless to say anything, so he could only bite the bullet and do it!

Therefore, Qin Yu hurriedly took out his magic ruler and met the attack with it.

“Boom!”

A terrifying collision occurred. Although Qin Yu had a Saint Weapon, he was still not the Semi-Saint’s opponent!

The moment they collided, Qin Yu was sent flying backward, and the bones in his arms were broken!

Just that trace of residual power made Qin Yu fall to the ground and vomit blood!

At this moment, Qin Yu finally realized the huge gap between him and a Semi-Saint!

Even if he was holding a Saint Weapon, he would not have the ability to fight back at all!

“Hahahaha!”

Seeing this, Tong Lianyang couldn’t help but burst into laughter!

“Qin Yu, this is the foundation of my Tong family!” Tong Lianyang scolded coldly.

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely ugly. This was just a casual attack by the old man, but it contained such terrifying power. If they really fought, everyone would probably be killed in a breath!

“Qin Yu!”

...

Chang Mang hurriedly rushed in front of Qin Yu and said in a panic, “How are you? Are you alright?”

Qin Yu pushed Chang Mang away and said in a deep voice, “We’re no match for him. You guys should leave quickly.”

“I’m not f*cking leaving!” Chang Mang’s eyes widened. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Qin Yu glared at Chang Mang and said, “Cut the crap. There’s no point in you staying here. I’m going to use an extremely powerful spell next. If you stay here, you’ll probably be affected.”

Chang Mang’s thoughts were more simple, and he believed Qin Yu. “I see… Will you be alright?”

“Don’t worry, I already have a plan.” Qin Yu was full of nonsense.

“Alright,” he said.

Chang Mang nodded in agreement.

He returned to Jiu Xiao and the others and told them what Qin Yu had said.

The peak master and Jiu Xiao opened their mouths, obviously not believing him, but they did not say anything.

Qin Yu stood up, looked at the old man, and said, “Senior, this matter started because of me and has nothing to do with them. Can you let them go?”

...

“Of course not,” the old man shook his head. “You don’t have the right to negotiate with me.”

“Senior,” Qin Yu gritted his teeth and continued, “After all, they are from Thunder Courtyard. It’s not a good thing for the Tong family if they all die here.

“Besides, I have something to tell you. You can’t let them hear it.”

The old man was silent for a moment.

He seemed to think that Qin Yu’s words made sense, so he waved his hand and said, “Alright, I’ll let them go.”

Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief. He hurriedly looked at Chang Mang and the others and said, “Hurry up and leave!”

Although Jiu Xiao and the others couldn’t bear it, they also knew that there was no point in staying, so they eventually left the Tong residence.

After they had gone far away, the old man looked at Qin Yu and said indifferently, “What do you want to say to me?”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and said with a faint smile, “What I have to say is… Old bastard, I’ll f*ck your dead mother!”
