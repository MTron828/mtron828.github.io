Chapter 2407 Cold Palace

Many cultivators seemed to be hiding here. However, as if they had received orders, no one came to stop Qin Yu.

While moving forward, Qin Yu sensed a tremendously gloomy internal qi.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and entered directly.

“It seems to be the cold palace where the emperor keeps his concubines. The concubines who have committed crimes will repent here, and some can’t even leave for the rest of their lives.”

Jue Wu had come into contact with the people of the Great Xia Royal Family in the past, so she had a rough understanding of the situation.

Qin Yu did not care about this. With his current power of the soul, he still felt cold, which was a little strange.

Suddenly, a burst of sobbing came from the side of a well.

A woman in a red wind robe was crying by the well.

“Girl, are you alright?”

Chang Mang walked over and asked in a muffled voice.

The woman turned her head, and her rotten face stared at Chang Mang. The corners of her lips curled into a smile, and a hoarse voice came out from her mouth.

“I’m so cold!”

“Oh my god! It’s a ghost!”

Chang Mang let out a wolf howl, his legs desperately stomping the ground. He was so scared that he almost peed.

“Ah!”

The red-robed woman’s face revealed a sinister expression as she instantly transformed into a streak of red light and crashed into Chang Mang.

At this moment, Chang Mang came back to his senses and struck out with his palm.

However, this woman straightaway pierced through his palm and then Chang Mang’s body.

In an instant, Chang Mang’s internal qi weakened significantly.

However, the woman’s internal qi seemed to be blooming. Her blood-red robe was so red that blood seemed to be dripping.

“This woman seems to have a spirit body. I can’t touch her!”

Chang Mang roared. Although he had not reached the Tribulation Transcending Stage, he was only a step away from it. Coupled with his innate holy body, he would not be defeated straightaway when facing a Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivator. However, he could not do anything to this red-robed woman.

Jue Wu suddenly pointed out with her finger. The finger that carried a trace of Vermillion Bird’s flames pierced through the red-robed woman instantly.

She let out a shrill scream.

But it was almost simultaneously that a gust of cold wind blew past them from all directions.

Amidst the rustling sounds, numerous palace maids and concubines appeared around them.

Some maids had just finished dressing up, some were fetching water from the well, and even more young girls were crying in their rooms.

The overwhelming resentment instantly swept through the entire cold palace.

In the air, visible water droplets crystallized, falling to the ground, and then countless ice flowers sprang up.

The extreme coldness of the soul almost froze the souls of Qin Yu and the others.

“Boom!”

The golden divine sense figurine in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness suddenly opened its eyes, and a golden Soul Shattering Golden Radiance suddenly slashed out.

In an instant, nearly 20 vengeful souls let out shrill howls before turning into mist and dissipating.

“Let’s go!”

After the attack, Qin Yu pulled Jue Wu and Chang Mang and instantly disappeared on the spot.

Behind them, the vengeful spirit chased after them. Its terrifying resentment was like the sea, wanting to pull their souls into the sea of resentment.

Vermilion Bird Dance!

Anger filled Jue Wu’s face. Her fist punched downward, and countless star flames instantly shot out along with her fist.

The vengeful spirits seemed to have met their nemesis as they let out miserable howls.

Taking advantage of this interval, Qin Yu decisively left this place.

“Something is wrong with these vengeful spirits. Even if we kill them, the resentment remains here, and they can’t escape from the Imperial Palace.”

Qin Yu looked at the cold palace, and a trace of coldness flashed in his eyes.

“I’ve also noticed that the surging resentment in the palace is too terrifying. Under this resentment, there are probably even more powerful vengeful spirits. We have to find the source quickly. Otherwise, we will suffer injuries once these vengeful spirits surround us, even if we can escape.”

Jue Wu said solemnly.

Qin Yu’s Soul Shattering Golden Radiance could only kill tens of vengeful souls, but the vengeful souls here were not only tens and hundreds and thousands.

Even Qin Yu might not be able to withstand it if these vengeful spirits attacked them.

“The annihilation of the Great Xia Royal Family doesn’t seem a coincidence. It’s the doing of the nine great aristocratic families.”

Qin Yu had a vague idea, and his eyes were cold.

The silver desolate divine eye on his forehead suddenly changed.

In the golden pupils, he saw another world. Numerous surging resentments were sealed in the Imperial Palace. At this moment, an invisible layer of power surrounded the palace. Those vengeful spirits that wanted to escape would immediately turn into ashes when they came into contact with that power.

The energy from their deaths would spread again in the palace, giving birth to new vengeful spirits.

Qin Yu closed his second-level desolate divine eyes. With a flash, he instantly arrived at the source.

“Ancestral temple? It was the burial ground of the ancestors of the Great Xia Royal Family.” Jue Wu looked at the enormous temple, and an ill feeling flashed across her heart.

The resentment here was even denser, at least ten times than the cold palace.

“There is indeed something fishy!”

Qin Yu suddenly stepped into the ancestral temple. In an instant, a cold resentment rushed into his sea of consciousness.

Every second he stood there consumed a vast amount of his soul power.

In front of him was a massive space filled with the smell of mud. There were exquisite stone sculptures on the pillars.

All the exquisite patterns on the palace’s roof and walls told the solemnity of this place.

Hundreds of spirit tablets were placed on the left and right sides of the table.

These were all the ancestors of the Great Xia Royal Family. Back then, the Great Xia Royal Family could establish a dynasty, and its power could be said to be the world’s ruler. Who would have thought that today, only the prince and his bloodline remained?

However, Qin Yu did not notice the internal qi that the desolate divine eye had comprehended previously.

“Something must have been hidden here.”

Qin Yu’s expression changed.

“Break!”

Endless golden light spread out from the desolate divine eye on his forehead again. At this moment, the world before him suddenly became ominous.

In the temple, countless little ghosts with powerful internal qi were playing around.

A rotten and sinister internal qi filled the entire space. It was the first time Qin Yu had seen such a massive ghostly qi.

The entire temple had been corroded by the ghostly qi. Hundreds of mirrors were hanging above.

And a woman’s face appeared in each mirror.

Some were laughing strangely, some were sticking flowers, some were using knives to hurt their faces, and some were calm.

And a tremendously strange sword was floating above the temple.

The sword seemed to have no physical body, and the hilt was made of a scarecrow.

A strange wind chime was tied to the sword hilt and the body.

Even though Qin Yu had experienced countless hardships and challenges, the scene before him sent shivers down his spine.

“Is this the f*cking palace or the netherworld?”

Qin Yu’s scalp went numb. He could not figure out what was going on.

At this moment, the space suddenly trembled.
