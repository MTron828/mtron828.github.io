1858 You’re Courting Death

He watched as Tong Lianyang stood up and walked out of the Great Hall.

Tong Guangqing was very reluctant, but he had no other choice.

He could only suppress his anger as he watched Tong Lianyang leave.

After he had walked far away, Tong Guangqing could not hold it in anymore.

He flipped over the table in front of him and smashed the entire Great Hall.

However, no matter what he did, he couldn’t change the thought at the bottom of Tong Lianyang’s heart.

“I was the one who found the token. What does it have to do with Tong Haoyang?” Tong Guangqing said through gritted teeth.

Uncle Guan stood silently at the side, not daring to say anything.

“In the end, he still got the upper hand.” Tong Guangqing gritted his teeth, the veins on his forehead bulging. He was trembling in anger.

Uncle Guan sighed and comforted him in a low voice, “Young Master, you’re Sir’s biological son. Maybe Sir just worried about you, so he doesn’t want you to go to Thunder Courtyard…”

Tong Guangqing didn’t say a word, but he felt bitter in his heart.

Such lies could only fool a three-year-old child.

…

At Demon-slaying Peak of Thunder Courtyard, Qin Yu had been waiting for several days. However, the mission had not been issued yet.

The impatient Qin Yu could only go and ask the peak master.

The peak master said helplessly, “I’ve asked the Hall of Justice. They said that this matter is of great importance and we have to make sure everything is in order. After all, it’s the Tong family.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu frowned and said, “Is the Hall of Justice suspecting us?”

“Who knows?” the peak master shrugged.

Qin Yu frowned.

If the mission was still not issued, Qin Yu might not be able to wait any longer. He could only choose to go to the Tong family alone.

The peak master seemed to have seen through Qin Yu’s intention. He patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “Don’t do anything stupid. I don’t want you to become the second Jue Wu.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath. He forced a smile and said, “Peak Master, don’t worry. I understand.”

In the following few days, Qin Yu was still waiting for news.

In the blink of an eye, eight days had passed.

During these eight days, Demon-slaying Peak didn’t issue any new missions. They seemed to be preparing for the trip to the Tong family.

On this day, the Demon-slaying Peak, which had been peaceful for a long time, suddenly welcomed an uninvited guest.

The peak master gathered everyone with a solemn expression and announced the arrival of this new person.

Qin Yu and Chang Mang were naturally invited as well. They came to the training ground and waited for the peak master and the newcomer to arrive.

A few minutes later.

The peak master brought the newly joined member to the training ground.

The peak master’s face was somewhat solemn. He looked at Qin Yu from time to time as if he was hinting at something.

Qin Yu frowned and glanced at the young man. He felt that the young man’s internal qi was extremely strong, and he also had a sense of superiority.

“This newcomer’s name is Tong Haoyang. He’s from the Tong family of Zhongzhou,” the peak master said slowly.

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s pupils suddenly constricted.

The Tong family!

He came from the Tong family!

Qin Yu’s face instantly turned cold, and killing intent was emitted unconsciously.

Not only Qin Yu, but everyone’s expression was a little unnatural.

The entire Demon-slaying Peak knew that the Tong family had killed several people from Demon-slaying Peak and kidnapped Jue Wu. Everyone hated the Tong family to some extent.

Not only did the Tong family avoid Demon-slaying Peak, but they had sent people to Demon-slaying Peak instead!

“The Tong family? What does the Tong family want to do?”

“This kid is a member of the Tong family. Is he courting death?”

“If we kill him here, he can’t do anything!”

Looking at the angry crowd, Tong Haoyang’s face didn’t show any signs of panic.

The peak master certainly saw everyone’s anger. However, as the peak master, he didn’t say much. Instead, he activated the formation.

Naturally, such a formation could not stop Tong Haoyang. He passed through the formation easily.

Looking at the somewhat arrogant Tong Haoyang, Cao Huang was the first to burst out.

He took a step forward and shouted, “Tong Haoyang, do you dare to fight me?!”

Tong Haoyang glanced at Cao Huang and said indifferently, “I’m afraid you’re not qualified.”

“How dare you say such arrogant words! Just watch how I’ll deal with you!” Cao Huang roared and charged straight toward Tong Haoyang!

Facing Cao Huang who was charging over, an unnoticeable sneer appeared on the corner of Tong Haoyang’s mouth.

Just as Cao Huang was approaching, an extremely bright radiance suddenly burst out from Tong Haoyang’s hand!

He suddenly raised his hand and thrust it straight at Cao Huang’s chest!

Cao Huang hurriedly clenched his fist to respond. However, the moment they made contact, his fist instantly shattered. One of his arms also vanished in an instant!

...

Without the arms’ blocking, Tong Haoyang’s palm suddenly grabbed Cao Huang’s chest!

“Pfft!”

The dazzling radiance pierced through Cao Huang’s chest!

Tong Haoyang’s bloodied palm stretched out from Cao Huang’s back!

Seeing this, everyone’s faces turned ugly.

Although Cao Huang was not considered top-notch in Demon-slaying Peak, he was definitely not weak!

But now, he was easily defeated by Tong Haoyang. This kind of strength was shocking.

Qin Yu’s expression was cold. He looked coldly in Tong Haoyang’s direction and immediately strode forward.

Before Qin Yu could speak, Tong Haoyang suddenly swept his gaze across the crowd and said, “Who’s Qin Yu?”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “I’m Qin Yu.”

Tong Haoyang sized Qin Yu up and nodded, “I’ve long heard of your name, and I’d like to see what you’re capable of.”

...

“I intend to do the same.” Qin Yu squinted his eyes, and his internal qi became even more intense.

Tong Haoyang did not panic. He shook his palm and took out a box.

“There’s no hurry,” Tong Haoyang said. “How about tomorrow? We’ll have a fair fight. You’ll be responsible for your own life and death. How about that?”

“I don’t think we need to wait until tomorrow. Let’s do it now,” Qin Yu sneered and said.

After he finished speaking, Qin Yu stomped his feet and instantly appeared in front of Tong Haoyang.

Tong Haoyang smiled and handed the box to Qin Yu.

“My master asked me to give you this,” Tong Haoyang said.

Qin Yu took the box. He frowned and then gradually opened it.

As soon as he opened the box, the smell of blood assailed his nose.

He saw a small hand in the box.

And the owner of this small hand was none other than Jue Wu!

“My master said you would definitely like it,” Tong Haoyang said with a faint smile.

“I think you’re… you’re courting death!” Qin Yu’s anger exploded in an instant!

A golden light came from the sky and covered Qin Yu’s body. His right fist was like a blazing sun!

“Boom!”

The Golden fist exploded with terrifying power and charged toward Tong Haoyang with a destructive force!
