Chapter 1382: Chapter 1,382, water of Life 1

Qin Yu passed through the lobby and rushed to the backyard.

When Qin Yu arrived at the backyard, he found boss Zheng standing there.

Sister Lin, on the other hand, was wearing a black hat and standing at the side.

When she saw Qin Yu, sister Lin blurted out, “Qin... You’re here.”

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly. He walked quickly to sister Lin and said, “Sister Lin, why are you here?”

Sister Lin smiled and said, “I’m here to see you.”

Boss Zheng, who was at the side, hurriedly flattered, “Xiao Yan, this child is not bad. He’s quite capable. You can rest assured with me!”

Sister Lin smiled and said, “With you around, of course I’ll be at ease.”

Boss Zheng could not help but look pleased. It seemed to be a great honor to receive sister Lin’s praise.

“Boss Zheng, give us a private room. I have something to talk to him alone,”said sister Lin.

Boss Zheng hurriedly nodded and said, “Okay, I’ll make the arrangements!”

He personally went out and arranged a private room for Qin Yu and sister Lin.

“Come, private room! Tell me what you want to Eat!”Boss Zheng patted his chest and said.

Sister Lin smiled and said, “You can order whatever you want. It depends on your mood.”

“Okay!”Boss Zheng walked out excitedly.

After he went out, sister Lin hurriedly closed the door.

Then, she took out a spiritual artifact that looked like an incense burner from the spatial artifact and placed it on the table.

The moment the spiritual artifact was taken out, threads of light bloomed like flowers, enveloping the entire private room.

“What is this?”Qin Yu asked curiously.

Sister Lin said, “This object can block spiritual sense. We can not let anyone hear our conversation.”

Qin Yu nodded repeatedly.

He sat opposite sister Lin and said, “Sister Lin, did you come to find me this time with any news? Did you find the life force?”

Sister Lin smiled and said, “Look at how anxious you are.”

Qin Yu touched his nose and said with an embarrassed smile, “You also know that I urgently need the life energy now.”

Sister Lin smiled faintly and said, “I don’t have the life energy, but... I did find something more precious than the life energy.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s expression immediately dimmed a little.

Other than the life energy, Qin Yu was not interested in any other treasures at the moment.

“What’s wrong? Are you disappointed?”Sister Lin rolled her eyes at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “Not really. It’s just that... I need the aura of life more.”

“Fool.”Sister Lin snorted. “There is indeed no news about the aura of life, but I have received news about the water of life.”

Qin Yu was stunned and hurriedly said, “Water of life? What is that?”

Sister Lin deliberately kept him in suspense and said, “Let’s eat first. I’m a little hungry.”

Qin Yu didn’t have the leisure time. He smiled bitterly and said, “Sister Lin, don’t keep me in suspense. Tell me quickly.”

“Do you really want to know?”Sister Lin raised her eyebrows and said.

Qin Yu hurriedly nodded and said, “Really!”

“If I tell you, what benefits will I get?”Sister Lin said with a wicked smile. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“As long as I can recover my spiritual power, I will promise you anything!”Qin Yu patted her chest and said.

“This is what you said! Swear to the heavens. If you go back on your words, the heavens will strike you with five Thunderbolts!”Sister Lin said seriously.

Qin Yu knew that cultivators couldn’t casually swear, but in order to get the life force, Qin Yu didn’t think twice and swore to the heavens according to sister Lin’s request.

After swearing, Qin Yu said anxiously, “Sister Lin, can you tell me now?”

“Of course,”sister Lin answered.

Just as she was about to speak, the door was opened.

Boss Zheng walked in with several waiters, including Ding Yi.

They held all kinds of delicacies in their hands, and soon a whole table was placed.

“Yan Qin, Why are you here?”Ding Yi asked curiously.

Boss Zheng berated, “Yan Qin is a guest today. Hurry up and get out!”

Ding Yi responded with an “OH”. Without saying anything, he turned around and left.

The waiters in the room all walked out of the door, while boss Zheng sat down by himself.

He picked up a pot of wine and said, “Sister Lin, this is the fine wine that I have treasured for many years. If it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t be willing to take it out!”

From the looks of it, boss Zheng obviously wanted to stay and eat together.

Sister Lin coughed dryly and said, “Boss Zheng, I’m sorry. I have some private matters to discuss with my brother. How about...”

Boss Zheng’s hand that was holding the pot of wine froze in mid-air.

He said somewhat awkwardly, “No problem, no problem. Then... Then you guys eat first. Call me if there’s anything!”

With that said, boss Zheng walked out dejectedly.

The door closed tightly, and the spiritual artifact was opened.

Qin Yu said impatiently, “Sister Lin, what exactly is the water of life?”

This time, sister Lin did not beat around the bush. She said in a deep voice, “The effect of the water of life is the same as the Qi of life, but the water of life is denser.”

Qin Yu instantly understood something.

Any gas that was concentrated to a certain degree would turn into liquid, such as spiritual Qi or even yin qi!

“Sister Lin, where is the water of life?”Qin Yu asked impatiently.
