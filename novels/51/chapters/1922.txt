1923 The Rumors about the Skywater Prison

Qin Yu’s face instantly darkened upon hearing what Saintess Gu said.

It was absolutely impossible to catch up to Si Shiyue in five years.

The difference in strength between the two was so huge that even if Qin Yu were to risk his life, he definitely could not catch up.

“Mr. Qin, why are you asking these questions? Are you also interested in the day of the Path of Heaven?” Saintess Gu suddenly asked.

!!

Qin Yu shook his head, seriously looking absent-minded.

The intelligent Saintess Gu seemed to have noticed something.

She sized Qin Yu up and said indifferently, “Is Mr. Qin having any plans for Saintess Yan?”

Qin Yu’s expression instantly changed drastically when he heard this.

He quickly shook his head and said, “Of course not. You… What made you say that?”

Saint said with a faint smile, “You racked your brain to find a way to get into the Yan family. And now, you’re asking me about the day of the Path of Heaven. All of this doesn’t make sense.”

“This… is normal, right?” Qin Yu said unconfidently.

“Normal? When you heard that there were only five years left before the day of the Path of Heaven, your expression became extremely unsightly. You even seemed to be at a loss,” Saintess Gu said, smiling faintly.

“As everyone knows, Saintess Yan and Si Shiyue will complete the engagement ceremony on the day of the Path of Heaven. You look so flustered. I’m afraid you want to snatch the bride, but there’s not enough time.”

Every word of Saintess Gu irritated Qin Yu, leaving him speechless.

He opened his mouth and then shook his head, “Saintess Gu, it’s not a good thing for a woman to be too smart. It will put pressure on men.”

“So, I guessed it right, did I?” Saintess Gu raised her brows and said.

“Of course not.” Qin Yu shook his head without any hesitation.

As long as he denied it, even if SaintessGu had guessed it right, what could she do?

Saintess Gu didn’t dwell on this. She just smiled and didn’t say anything. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Qin Yu sipped his tea while thinking of countermeasures. He planned to ask Saintess Gu to explore the hidden treasure with her.

At this moment, a young man walked over from not far away.

This person’s appearance was uncommon, and his temperament was even extraordinary. He was clearly not an ordinary person.

“Saintess Gu.” He walked up to Saintess Gu and bowed slightly as a greeting.

“Mr. Yao.” Saintess Gu also bowed.

Hearing this, Qin Yu looked back unconsciously.

Mr. Yao was probably a member of the Yao family.

“Who is this?” Mr. Yao also looked at Qin Yu at the same time.

“This is Mr. Qin, Qin Yu. He also has a chaotic body,” Saintess Gu introduced.

“Oh? Qin Yu? Are you the one who crushed the Tong family and defeated Si Shiyu? I’ve heard of you. You’re the second chaotic body in the world,” Mr. Yao said in surprise.

Qin Yu nodded at him as a greeting.

“This is Mr. Yao, Yao Tianqian,” Saintess Gu introduced.

“Mr. Yao,” Qin Yu stood up and greeted him.

Yao Tianqian said with a smile, “Mr. Qin, you don’t have to be so humble. I remember my Yao family seemed to have invited you before. Why didn’t you come to visit my Yao family? ”

“I… I was held up by some matters recently. I’m thinking of taking some time to visit the Yao family,” Qin Yu said awkwardly.

Yao Tianqian laughed heartily and said, “Mr. Qin, you don’t have to be nervous. I’m just saying it casually. Although the Yao family has invited you, it’s not forcing you. We’re just interested in you.”

These words seemed polite, but in fact, they had unintentionally revealed the powerful background of the Yao family.

For the Yao family, a genius was worth inviting but not indispensable. After all, this world did not lack geniuses.

“Mr. Yao, how come you have time to visit my Cold Moon Palace today?” Saintess Gu waved her hand and poured Yao Tianqian a cup of tea.

Yao Tianqian smiled and said, “Nothing much. It’s just that I encountered a bottleneck recently and wanted to discuss it with Saintess gu. I’ve particularly come to discuss dao. I wonder if Saintess Gu has the time?”

“To be able to discuss dao with Mr. Yao is more than I could wish for,” Saintess Gu said.

Knowing he couldn’t blend in their circle, Qin Yu stood up and said, “I have some matters to attend to. I’ll make a move first.”

“Mr. Qin, why are you in such a hurry? Why don’t you sit down and let us discuss?” Yao Tianqian invited him.

Qin Yu smiled and declined. “My state of dao is still shallow. I’m afraid I can’t help Mr. Yao. If there’s a chance in the future, I’ll definitely visit you.”

After saying that, Qin Yu got up and was about to leave.

After taking two steps, Qin Yu turned around and looked at the two of them.

“Saintess Gu, I have one more thing,” Qin Yu said.

Without waiting for Saintess Gu to speak, Yao Tianqian got up and said, “Let me excuse myself first.”

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “It’s not necessary. It’s not something shameful. I just want to ask if Saintess Gu has heard of the Si family’s Skywater Prison?”

“Skywater Prison? Of course, I do.” Saintess Gu nodded.

“I heard it’s a tremendously cold purgatory field. It was left behind by the experts of the Si family’s old generation. It has provided the Si family with endless cultivation resources.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and continued asking, “What will happen if someone is locked in the Skywater Prison?”

“Locked in the Skywater Prison?” Saintess looked a little stunned.

Yao Tianqian at the side shook his head and said, “Very slim chance of survival. Only very few people can survive in that kind of place.”

“That’s right. Once you are locked in the Skywater Prison, extreme cold will invade your body, and you will turn into a wisp of smoke,” Saintess Gu said.

...

“Rumor has it that this wisp of smoke is the source and essence of a cultivator. It has great benefits for cultivation.”

After hearing what they said, Qin Yu’s expression turned extremely ugly.

“Mr. Qin, why did you ask?” Saintess Gu asked.

“That friend of mine, Chang Mang, has been locked into the Skywater Prison by Si Shifeng…” Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said.

“That holy body?” Saintess Gu said in surprise.

“Yes,” Qin Yu said. “After leaving here, he was ambushed by the Si family. Now, he’s locked up in the Skywater Prison.”

Then Qin Yu said in a hurry, “I’ll make a move first.”

After saying this, Qin Yu was about to leave in a hurry.

“Mr. Qin, where are you going?” Saintess Gu quickly asked.

“Go to the Si family to ask for him,” Qin Yu said, gritting his teeth.

“You? Go to the Si family to ask for him?” Yao tTianqian, who was at the side, suddenly laughed.

...

“Mr. Qin, it’s not that I’m looking down on you. I’m afraid you won’t be able to get him back from the Si family and will even die there,” Yao Tianqian shook his head and said.

“That’s right,” Saintess Gu nodded and said. “You’re just a rogue cultivator, yet you’re barging into the nine great aristocratic families to ask for someone. How will the Si family take it? I’m afraid it will backfire.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “I know, but I don’t have a choice now. If I really can’t do it, I’ll exchange myself for Chang Mang.”
