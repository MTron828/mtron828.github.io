Chapter 259: Threat Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The venue was filled with noise. Amidst the cheers of the crowd, Yang Jing finally stepped onto the stage.

It had to be said that Yang Jing was indeed shining brightly on the stage. She was quite charming.

Fortunately, Qin Yu was surrounded by Yang Jing’s friends, so other than Xiao Yu, no one else was cheering wildly.

Qin Yu wasn’t interested in this kind of concert, so he simply closed his eyes and felt the inner strength in his body.

Streams of spiritual sense were released under Qin Yu’s guidance.

Now, Qin Yu’s spiritual sense was a bit stronger. Although it couldn’t be compared to Fang Yue’s, it could cover the entire concert with ease.

“Huh?”

Soon, Qin Yu felt a strong internal qi in this concert.

“There are actually martial artists who came to watch the concert?” Qin Yu touched his chin and subconsciously looked back.

According to the guidance of his spiritual sense, Qin Yu looked at a distance not far away.

What surprised Qin Yu was that the other party was also looking at Qin Yu.

Their eyes met, and the other party quickly shifted his gaze to the stage.

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

The other party was a man in his thirties. This person looked ordinary, but his internal qi was quite strong.

Updates by

Qin Yu guessed that the other party was at least a Inner Strength Past Master, or even a peak Inner Strength Past Master.

“Who is it?” Qin Yu, feeling puzzled, touched his chin.

However, Qin Yu didn’t think too much about it. A mere Inner Strength Past Master couldn’t hurt him.

Time flew by, and two hours passed in a flash.

The performance on the stage also began to come to an end.

Yang Jing was holding a farewell ceremony on stage, and many of the fans were crying.

Even Xiao Yu’s eyes were red, and she looked reluctant to leave.

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “That’s enough. There are plenty of opportunities for you to see her.”

Xiao Yu rubbed her eyes and stammered, “You don’t understand.”

The concert ended with a series of cheers.

As soon as it ended, Qin Yu couldn’t wait to drag Xiao Yu back.

Although Xiao Yu was very reluctant, she was still dragged out by Qin Yu.

Fortunately, Qin Yu and the others left early. Otherwise, they would have been stuck in traffic for the rest of their lives.

After sending Xiao Yu home, Qin Yu drove home.

Qin Yu had too many things to do at the moment. The invitation from the Military District and Gu Taichu’s ruckus gave Qin Yu a headache.

After rushing home, Qin Yu prepared another formation to fight Gu Taichu.

However, as soon as Qin Yu arrived home, he saw two people standing at the door.

One of them was old and the other was young. The young one was the one Qin Yu met at the concert.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He walked forward and asked in a sullen voice, “Why are you looking for me?”

The young man smiled and said, “Mr. Qin, we meet again.”

“Who are you?” Qin Yu asked expressionlessly.

“Hehe, Mr. Qin, you once killed one of our members. Have you forgotten about this matter?” The old man said indifferently.

When he heard this, Qin Yu frowned even more.

Killed one of their members? Why didn’t he have any impression?

“Mr. Qin is really forgetful,” the old man said indifferently.

“The tragic death of our member in South City is Mr. Qin’s masterpiece,” the old man said with an aloof smile. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Qin Yu finally remembered.

Back in South City, Qin Yu helped Lu Shuming kill an enemy named Scarface.

Scarface had said that his organization would come to seek revenge.

But he didn’t expect it to be so late. Qin Yu had almost forgotten about this matter.

“Are you here for revenge?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and asked indifferently.

The old man laughed and said, “Mr. Qin, you are wrong. It doesn’t matter if that kind of insignificant person dies. What’s the point of mentioning it?”

“Oh really?” The doubt on Qin Yu’s face deepened.

“Then what do you want?” Qin Yu asked.

The old man said indifferently, “Why don’t we talk in the room?”

“I don’t think there’s a need. If you have something to say, just say it here,” Qin Yu said expressionlessly.

These organizations were all swindlers, so Qin Yu naturally didn’t like them.

The old man wasn’t angry. He smiled and said, “Okay, let me introduce myself. I’m Xing Hongtao, a consultant of the Hong Yi Sect.”

Hong Yi Sect?

Was this the name of that organization?

Qin Yu frowned and said, “What do you want from me?”

Xing Hongtao smiled aloofly and said, “To tell you the truth, the Hong Yi Sect has always been vengeful. No one dares to kill a member of our Hong Yi Sect.”

Qin Yu said somewhat impatiently, “Can we get straight to the point?”

Xing Hongtao laughed loudly and said, “It seems that Mr. Qin is a straightforward person.”

“According to our previous rules, we must kill you and establish the might of our sect.”

“However, our elders admire Mr. Qin’s potential as well as his alchemy skills, so we specially invited you to join the Hong Yi Sect.”

“As for the conditions, feel free to state them. Whether it’s money, herbs, or cultivation techniques, we will never be stingy!”

After hearing Xing Hongtao’s words, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

Although he didn’t know much about Hong Yi Sect, he had heard from Lu Shuming that Hong Yi Sect didn’t dare to be out in the public eye.

This was enough to prove that their dealings were definitely shady.

“Sorry, I’m not interested,” Qin Yu said expressionlessly.

Xing Hongtao said with a smile, “Mr. Qin, why are you in such a hurry to refuse? I can give you a few days to consider.”

“There’s no need to consider it. I said I’m not interested,” Qin Yu said expressionlessly.

“If there’s nothing else, I’m going home.”

After saying that, Qin Yu turned around and left.

“Stop!”

At this time, the young man suddenly shouted!

An invisible wall appeared in front of Qin Yu and blocked Qin Yu’s way!

“Why? Do you still need me for something?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said.

Xing Hongtao said with an aloof smile, “Mr. Qin, it’s okay if you don’t join the Hong Yi Sect, but you have to hand over the formula for the Nine Transformation Golden Pill as compensation for our sect.”

“Nine Transformation Golden Pill?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

How did they know? Could it be that Dong Tianhai had released the news?

“Mr. Qin, as long as you hand over the formula for the Nine Transformation Golden Pill, our sect will never bother you again,” Xing Hongtao said with an aloof smile.

Qin Yu slowly turned around.

He looked at Xing Hongtao coldly and said, “What if I don’t hand it over?”

“If you don’t hand it over, you won’t be able to leave!” The young man shouted.

“I won’t be able to leave?” Qin Yu’s expression turned cold. He suddenly threw a punch backward, and the invisible wall was instantly shattered!

“You plan to stop me with such a clumsy technique?” Qin Yu said coldly.

The young man’s expression suddenly changed, and he was somewhat shocked.

Xing Hongtao chuckled and said, “As expected of the King of Chuzhou. You live up to your reputation!”

Qin Yu said with a cold expression, “It’s best if you don’t bother me anymore.”

After saying that, Qin Yu walked home.

“Mr. Qin, if you don’t hand over the formula for the Nine Transformation Golden Pill, our sect definitely won’t let you off the hook!” Xing Hongtao shouted from behind.

Qin Yu, who had intended to go home, immediately stopped when he heard these words.

He turned around and said with narrowed eyes, “Are you threatening me?”
