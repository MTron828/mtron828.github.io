2330 The Mysterious Person of Demon Race

With the help of Qin Yu’s enormous divine sense, he was lucky enough to avoid all the living beings this time.

He then stopped in front of a barrier.

In the world of the desolate divine eye, the qi of the Path of Heaven in front of him was entirely chaotic if he moved another step further.

He seemed to have entered another world, and in the very center of it, there was a light of the Path of Heaven that even the desolate divine eye could not see clearly.

“That should be the internal qi of the Vermillion Bird…”

Qin could not resist that internal qi. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Qin Yu gently sat down in front of the barrier and waited quietly.

Jue Wu no longer had internal qi. She was relying on the dense medicinal qi in the Sumeru ring to hang on to her last trace of life force.

The Vermilion Bird was one of the four sacred beasts.

It could even suppress the Path of Heaven when the Path of Heaven was silent. Even facing the most vigorous power of the Path of Heaven, it could unleash the power of a half-step Tribulation transcending Stage.

It was even more terrifying than the might of his divine sense, and its body was bathed in the divine fire.

Its body had long been indestructible as a diamond. All this information was constantly telling Qin Yu how difficult this journey was.

“Tip-tap, tip-tap…”

Light footsteps sounded behind Qin Yu.

When Qin Yu noticed him, he had already come to his side and sat down.

A good-looking demon sat beside Qin Yu.

His hands were fair, and he placed his slender hands on his thighs.

He had seen this mysterious demon before. Wasn’t he the young man of the demon race who had killed many top-notch martial artists from the aristocratic families and represented the Azure Rock Forest at the Teng family’s banquet?

Qin Yu’s heart was in turmoil. He had a hundred questions he wanted to ask this demon, but he did not know where to start.

“You came from the Azure Rock Forest, didn’t you?” Qin Yu asked tentatively.

“Call me Mo.”

Mo nodded and then shook his head.

Qin Yu frowned. Since Mo could appear here, he should have come through the teleportation formation.

In that case, wouldn’t he have a chance to return to the Holy Region?

He forcefully suppressed the excitement in his heart and asked another question.

“Will you attack me?”

Mo shook his head, reached out his delicate fingers, and pointed at the barrier.

“I’m here because of it. Whether or not to attack you depends on if you can surprise me. I’m not confident if it will submit to me if it’s at its peak.”

He sat quietly beside Qin Yu and answered whatever Qin Yu asked. There were no signs of him making a move.

At this moment, Qin Yu was somewhat in a difficult position. This mysterious person was able to fool the nine great aristocratic families back then in the Holy Region.

The nine great aristocratic families had even sent out True Saints, but he managed to escape effortlessly. His appearance here was definitely not a good thing for Qin Yu.

Qin Yu did not know the current situation in the Holy Region, but the spatial rift here had widened.

The ghost and monster race kept breaking through the spatial cracks and attacking the humans.

The demons also kept attacking human cultivators recently, and the conflict between the two sides was almost inevitable.

Qin Yu’s thoughts were racing, and he could not guess what this mysterious person in front of him was planning.

“Stop guessing if I can’t guess it.”

Qin Yu shook his head.

He decided to calm down and ignore the young man beside him.

Qin Yu absorbed nature’s spiritual energy in the surroundings and transformed it into a chaotic qi that entered his body, adjusting his condition to the best.

“Your time is up. You only have fifteen minutes.”

The demon looked at Qin Yu.

At this moment, a rosy glow suddenly pierced through the mist.

There was only a trace of that glow, but it could penetrate the mist that had been surging and overlapping for ten thousand years.

Qin Yu felt the shackles on his body begin to melt, and his strength increased rapidly.

In the ninth level of purgatory, anyone who stepped into this place would be suppressed by a mysterious power. At this moment, when the Path of Heaven was at its peak, this feeling finally disappeared.

“Jue Wu, you must hold on.”

Qin Yu’s eye expression was determined as he stepped into the barrier.

In an instant, Qin Yu felt as if he had been transported through time and space, his body like a small boat in the midst of a hurricane.

After much turbulence for a long time, he finally took that step, and the scene before him had already undergone drastic changes.

On the endless scorched ground, the space was silent.

Not a single bug seemed to be in the world where divine sense could not see the boundary. The whole world was dead silent. Qin Yu could even clearly hear his own heartbeat.

In the center, a woman in a fiery red robe sat on the ground.

The back of the robe was very long and dragged all the way back.

It was like a long blood-red river, looking very eerie.

Was this the Vermilion Bird? Qin Yu’s divine sense swept past her, but he could not sense the slightest fluctuation.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and gently walked toward the woman.

In the endless depths of the woman, Qin Yu saw a passage that was suffused with a dark green light.

From time to time, a strange howl came from inside as if this passage was connected to the gate of hell.

And around the passage, eight giant dragon corpses were kneeling on the ground.

Among them was Dragon Uncle, his body shimmering with endless golden light. Even though he had been dead for many years, he still exuded a breathtaking internal qi.

“Five-clawed Golden Dragon!”

Qin Yu’s heart trembled. It was the strongest in the dragon race.

According to the records, to be known as a divine dragon in the dragon race, one had to form a dragon pearl in its body and devour the power of heaven and earth in addition to controlling powerful strength.

Moreover, the five claws symbolized the peak experts of the dragon race and possessed powerful bloodline power. Not only that, the power contained in the Five-clawed Golden Dragon was enough to destroy the entire demon race.

At this moment, the Five-clawed Golden Dragon had also died here.

What exactly was that passage?

In the space, living beings would appear from time to time. They seemed to be souls of the dead, leaving behind a trace of their obsessions in their previous lives.

However, the terrifying dao techniques that flashed in their hands from time to time showed that they were the strongest experts of the human race when they were alive.

The scenes behind the Vermilion Bird made Qin Yu’s scalp tingle. No wonder Ji Yue felt that he was courting death.

However, there was no way to retreat now. Jue Wu’s life was on the line.

He would never forgive himself if he did not fight for it.

“Senior, my friend is injured by a curse and needs a drop of your blood essence to come into contact with the curse. Please grant my request, and I’ll pay the price no matter what!”

Qin Yu stepped forward, cupped his fists, and said.

Qin Yu waited for a long time, but he did not hear any response.

He took another step forward but saw that the woman before him had already raised her head.

A pair of demonic eyes had been staring at him. In an instant, Qin Yu felt that he could not even think.

The demonic pupils emitted a blood-red light as if they wanted to absorb Qin Yu’s mind.

The demonic divine inscription appeared one after another on her body, forming a fire totem pattern on her delicate hands and forehead.

Then, the divine inscriptions suddenly burst out with intense red light.

Flames Burning the Source.

In the next moment, a vast expanse of flames had already enveloped the entire barrier.
