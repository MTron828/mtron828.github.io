Chapter 38: I’ve Shown You Too Much Respect, Right? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The scene was silent.

No one thought that things would escalate to this point.

No one expected Qin Yu to disregard the status of the Shen family and strike so hard.

At this moment, Qin Yu glanced at Su Yan with cold eyes and said, “I no longer have a relationship with you, so you’d better leave me alone. Otherwise...you will be responsible for the consequences!”

These words weren’t only directed at Su Yan, but also at Zhao Gang.

When Qin Yu was gone, Su Yan couldn’t refrain from sneering and saying, “You beat Shen Tian. I’ll see how many more days you can act cocky for!”

Almost everyone had the same thought.

After stepping out of the villa, Qin Yu got into Lei Hu’s car.

”Mr. Qin, you were awesome today!” Lei Hu gave him a thumbs up.

Qin Yu wasn’t thinking about that, but the environment of this villa.

The spiritual energy here enabled Qin Yu to enter the third level of the Qi Refining stage with increased concentration. Therefore, this place was a mecca for Qin Yu.

Qin Yu secretly thought.

While heading back, Lei Hu whispered a caution, “Mr. Qin, you’d better go to Miss Ruoxue’s place one of these days, or else...the Shen family definitely won’t let you off the hook...”

Qin Yu looked at Lei Hu and said with a shake of his head, “I can’t trouble her with everything, not to mention...The Shen family is no big deal.”

The Shen family was very powerful but Qin Yu was unafraid.

He was a lone wolf, so what could the Shen family possibly do to him?

When Lei Hu saw this, he didn’t say anything further.

Later that evening, Shen Tian was brought to the hospital.

Unfortunately, the bones in his arm were so badly shattered that they had turned into dust, making it impossible to fix.

When Shen Tian found out about this, he was devastated.

”Do I have to be a cripple for the rest of my life...Qin Yu, I will kill you! I will kill you!” Shen Tian roared in rage.

The following day, news of the incident had spread throughout most of Jiangcheng.

Yan family manor.

”Qin Yu has guts! Because of his relationship with you, he can do whatever he pleases! He even dared to beat up Mr. Shen!” the secretary said indignantly.

Yan Ruoxue, however, didn’t take it to heart and was excited instead of upset as she watched the video recording of the incident.

”Miss Ruoxue, Qin Yu has only known you for a few days and he’s already causing all sorts of trouble everywhere. It will be even worse in the future,” the secretary muttered on the side.

Yan Ruoxue shook her head as she showed the video to the secretary and said, “What have you discovered?”

The secretary watched the video and mumbled after some scrutiny, “Miss, forgive me for my stupidity. I don’t notice anything unusual...”

Yan Ruoxue said with a soft smile, “In the face of so many people’s criticism and abuse, Qin Yu not only didn’t lose his temper but also managed to keep his cool.”

”This mentality alone is something that Shen Tian can’t rival,” Yan Ruoxue said with a smile.

The secretary muttered, “This is not a big deal. There are a lot of people with strong self-composure in Jingdu...” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

”Yes, this is indeed not a big deal,” Yan Ruoxue said indifferently.

”Those people have been trained either by their families since childhood and have become accustomed to it, or their experience has come from age.”

”It only took Qin Yu a week to possess this resilient mindset, and a week ago, he was just an ordinary commoner,” Yan Ruoxue sounded slightly relieved.

The secretary was perplexed. He looked down on Qin Yu from the core. Therefore, regardless of what Yan Ruoxue said, changing his mind was difficult.

”From the looks of it, my grandfather was right. Qin Yu won’t disappoint me,” Yan Ruoxue laughed lightly.

The secretary muttered, “Miss Yan, but...he beat up Shen Tian. The Shen family will never forgive him, and you will have to explain...”

”Explain?” Disdain flashed in Yan Ruoxue’s eyes.

”Why should I explain? Do I need to explain to the Shen family?” Yan Ruoxue snickered coldly.

When the secretary heard this, he didn’t say anything further.

Meanwhile, Shen Tian’s father, Shen Yun, had rushed to Jiangcheng.

At the hospital, Shen Tian grabbed Shen Yun’s arm with a face full of tears.

”Dad, you must take revenge for me! I want him killed by a thousand stabs!” Shen Tian cried out.

”And there’s Yan Ruoxue. Without Yan Ruoxue’s backing, that kid would never have dared to be so brazen!”

When he saw his son in this state, Shen Yun was seething with anger!

”Son, don’t worry. I will avenge you!” said Shen Yun through gritted teeth.

”Rest well. I will make him suffer the consequences.” Shen Yun gave some instructions before he left the hospital and headed straight to the Yan family’s estate.

When she saw the furious Shen Yun, Yan Ruoxue wasn’t taken aback but smiled politely and said, “Uncle Shen, what brings you here?”

Shen Yun berated, “Yan Ruoxue, don’t bullsh*t me! My son came to Jiangcheng from the provincial capital to win you over, but what did you do? Instead of looking after him, you let him get badly hurt! What do you have to say about this incident?”

When she heard Shen Yun’s words, Yan Ruoxue’s expression gradually cooled down.

”I’ve shown you a lot of respect, but do you consider yourself some big shot?” Yan Ruoxue said in a cold voice. “I call you uncle because I’m polite, not because I’m afraid of you.”

”Shen Yun, who gave you the guts to raise your voice in front of me?”
