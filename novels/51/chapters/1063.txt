Chapter 1064: Chapter 1,064, facing off against Gu Zizhen! 

Seeing one martial marquis after another die in front of him, Zhai Xing could do nothing.

This kind of despair made him wish he was dead.

“Qin Yu, quickly find the Sky Blood Rainbow and stop him!”In a moment of desperation, Zhai Xing placed his hopes on Qin Yu.

But this undoubtedly infuriated Gu Zizhen!

“Zhai Xing, it seems that your relationship with Qin Yu is really not ordinary,”gu Zizhen said coldly.

Seeing this, Qin Yu also spread his hands and said, “You saw it. This is the master you are following. He won’t care about the lives of others.”

“Moreover, once this secret technique is activated, there is no way to stop it. I don’t have the ability of the masked woman.”

“Pu, Pu, Pu!”

The surrounding people continued to explode and die. One had to admit that this had indeed helped Qin Yu.

This kind of technique could not affect the martial saints at all, and these martial marquis naturally did not have the mood to fight.

Qin Yu looked at Gu Zizhen and said coldly, “Do you still want to continue?”

Gu Zizhen said with a gloomy face, “Nothing can change my determination. Today, the two of You Must Die Here!”

After he finished speaking, the two martial saints beside Gu Zizhen walked over.

He originally had four martial saints under him. Chi Hou had been killed by Qin Yu, and Zhai Xing had been captured by him.

Now, only Xuan Qi was left, and there was another man named Yin Tao.

“If you want to fight, then let’s fight. Today, it’s better if we share the burden,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Before the great battle had begun, Qin Yu’s body was already covered in blood.

Since gu Zizhen was doubting that they were going to fight, Qin Yu naturally would not show any mercy.

“I’ll leave the two martial saints to you.”Qin Yu looked at the immortal crane.

“Can you do it?”The Immortal Crane asked.

Qin Yu snorted coldly and said, “He’s only at the peak of the Martial Saint Realm. So what? I’m not afraid of him!”

After he finished speaking, Qin Yu’s hair danced wildly. He took a step forward and showed his disdain towards the world!

Gu Zizhen’s old face was filled with viciousness. His rat-like eyes were emitting a strong killing intent.

“Little Bastard, I’ve allowed you to live under my nose for so long. I Won’t make this mistake again!”

As he spoke, Gu Zizhen let out a furious roar and the internal Qi from his entire body instantly erupted to the extreme!

The strength of a peak martial saint was unimaginable. He was three whole realms higher than Qin Yu!

And today, Qin Yu was going to cross realms and fight!

He did not dare to hide his strength at all. The power of the divine dragon erupted in an instant.

At the same time, Qin Yu took out the five mountains and placed it on his left hand.

The five mountains emitted an intense pressure that made Qin Yu look like a god of war. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Boom!”

Gu Zizhen took the initiative to attack. He waved his hand and a majestic qi burst out!

Qin Yu did not intend to take it head-on. He executed the ‘xing’character and retreated dozens of meters. Then, he threw out a seven sorrow palm!

Gu Zizhen waved his hand and easily shattered the seven sorrow palm!

He stepped on the main path and arrived in front of Qin Yu. His long hair turned into chains and bound Qin Yu’s limbs!

“Go to hell!”

Using the power of the long hair, Gu Zizhen quickly attacked Qin Yu!

A pitch-black sharp blade appeared in his palm, aiming straight for Qin Yu’s chest!

Qin Yu’s face turned cold, and he hurriedly took out the five mountains of honor in his hand!

A thick and heavy force instantly covered Gu Zizhen’s body!

Gu Zizhen’s body instantly fell rapidly, and in the blink of an eye, he was pressed to the ground!

Qin Yu seized the opportunity to break free, and then his hands quickly slid, forming a mysterious great seal!

The seal glowed in Qin Yu’s palm and grew bigger and bigger. It was like a millstone that came crashing down!

Gu Zizhen’s expression changed drastically. He was full of anger. After a loud roar, he actually shook off the five peaks’Supreme Mountain. His palm faced the great seal!

“Boom!”

A loud bang exploded at this moment. Void after void was shattered and was slowly recovering!

Qin Yu could not help but be shocked! This Gu Zi was indeed extraordinary. He actually managed to break free from the mountain of the five peaks easily!

“Little Bastard, you should die!”

Gu Zi Zhen seemed to want to end the battle quickly. He actually directly unleashed the five-petal Lotus!

The five-petal lotus emitted a brilliant light. With a flick of his withered hand, a lotus flower flew towards Qin Yu!

The destructive power on the lotus flower could not help but be moved.

Qin Yu did not dare to use his physical body to resist it. He hurriedly took out the purple-gold gourd and injected a wisp of spiritual qi into it!

In an instant, the purple light illuminated the heaven and earth, and terrifying fluctuations swept in all directions!

The power contained in the purple light was indescribable. Like a jet, it erupted from the mouth of the gourd and met the five-petaled lotus!

“Boom!”

With this collision, the entire void was about to collapse!

A large piece of space like a piece of general fell and fell to the ground, revealing a strange and mysterious black!

Internal Qi was annihilated, many martial marquis were directly shaken into a bloody mist, together with the divine sense was killed!

This is a battle between weapons, but it is also a battle of the arms!

The destructive force is still spreading. Even the cranes are affected.

His eyes and hands were sharp, and he quickly shot out.

Xuan qi and Yin Tao were not so lucky. They were affected by the internal QI, and their bodies were directly shattered!

Qin Yu grabbed the purple-gold calabash and shot backward at the same time.

He looked at the center of the explosion arrogantly and indifferently, and he could not help but feel a little shocked.

The consequences of the collision of such weapons were already unimaginable! If a mighty figure were to fight, it would only be more terrifying!

“Ah! !”

At this moment, Gu Zizhen’s mouth let out a furious roar. He was also affected, and his body was stained with a trace of blood.

He held the five-petaled lotus with only three petals in one hand, and his eyes were filled with madness.

“Little Bastard, you actually have such a treasure!”Gu Zizhen wiped the blood off his face, and his eyes were filled with hatred!

Qin Yu held the purple-gold gourd in his right hand and the mountain of five peaks in his left hand, showing no fear on his face.

“Gu Zizhen, your five-petal lotus can be used at most three times, while my purple-gold gourd can be used indefinitely!”Qin Yu shouted.

“Put down the five-petal Lotus in your hand, and we will fight to the death. Do you dare? !”

Gu Zizhen could not help but say angrily, “Little Bastard, I am not afraid of You!”

He put away the five-petaled lotus and rushed towards Qin Yu!
