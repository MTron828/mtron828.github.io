Chapter 367: The Resurrection Began! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

This figure wasn’t burly, but at this moment, he looked extremely imposing.

Cao Shan’s palm landed firmly on his body.

“Yan... Yan Jiang?” Seeing this person, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel stunned.

Yan Jiang turned around and glanced at Qin Yu while saying coldly, “Go.”

Qin Yu got up from the ground and frowned, “Then what do you do?”

Yan Jiang didn’t answer. Instead, he said coldly, “Leave this place to me. You should leave quickly.”

Qin Yu, not knowing what to say for a moment, opened his mouth.

Although Yan Jiang was powerful, the people in front of him were five peak-stage Inner Strength Grandmasters!

No matter how strong Yan Jiang was, he was just an ordinary person. Facing five opponents of the same realm, he was probably doomed.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said, “I can’t leave you here. You’ve already saved me twice.”

However, Yan Jiang roared angrily, “Get lost quickly! I’m not doing it for you. I’m doing it for Miss Yan!”

“Miss Yan has high hopes for you. Do you want to let her down?!”

These two sentences instantly made Qin Yu speechless.

He gritted his teeth and cupped his hands while saying, “Yan Jiang, I, Qin Yu, will never forget your great kindness!”

After saying that, Qin Yu cupped his hands to Yan Jiang, turned around and prepared to leave.

“You want to leave? Dream on!” Cao Shan’s foot shook, and that strange space appeared again!

At this moment, Yan Jiang roared, and the violent power shattered this space into pieces!

“Go!” Yan Jiang roared angrily.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to waste any more time. He immediately used the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique and fled!

Cao Shan’s expression gradually turned cold.

“Since you dared to ruin my plans, you will die for him!” Cao Shan said through gritted teeth.

An unprecedented battle erupted at this moment.

Qin Yu fled wildly. He didn’t know how many miles he had fled before he stopped.

“Yan Jiang, you must survive...” Qin Yu looked in the direction of the Yunchuan Martial Arts Association and whispered.

The most important thing now was to gather as many people as possible to revive Old Mister Yan.

Time had been delayed, so it was impossible for Qin Yu not to be anxious.

But where could he find seven Inner Strength Past Masters?

Just as Qin Yu was at a loss, he suddenly thought of something!

“Elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion!” A hint of excitement flashed in Qin Yu’s eyes!

This identity was enough to make an Inner Strength Past Master work for him!

Therefore, he immediately went to the Martial Arts Forum to post a message.

“An Elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion is requesting the help of six Inner Strength Past Masters. You will definitely be heavily rewarded afterward!”

Under this message was the location of the Earth Fiend Valley unit.

After sending this message, Qin Yu rushed straight to the Earth Fiend Valley.

Jiang Gu had been waiting at the Earth Fiend Valley for a long time.

After seeing Qin Yu, he hurriedly walked forward.

“Mr. Qin, what... what happened to you?” Seeing Qin Yu’s body full of injuries, Jiang Gu asked in shock.

Qin Yu waved his hand and didn’t explain anything. Instead, he found a place to sit cross-legged. While he recovered his body, he waited for the arrival of Inner Strength Past Masters.

About half an hour later, countless people came!

In just a few minutes, there were actually more than twenty people gathered at the entrance of the Earth Fiend Valley!

Among them, there was no lack of Inner Strength Past Masters, and even those at the peak of the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm!

Facing so many experts, Qin Yu also appeared somewhat surprised.

He climbed up from the ground, cupped his hands and said, “Thank you all for coming to help.”

“Haha, it’s our honor to be able to work for an Elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion,” everyone said one after another.

“Mr. Qin, can you take out your Divine Alchemist Pavilion Elder’s token for us to have a look? It’s not that I don’t believe you, but I’m just curious. I hope you don’t mind,” someone said.

Qin Yu nodded. He took out the token from his pocket.

After seeing the token, everyone immediately became even more enthusiastic.

“Mr. Qin, what do you need us to do? Just ask!”

“That’s right, we are willing to do anything!”

Qin Yu hurriedly cupped his hands and said, “Thank you for your enthusiasm. I only need six people.”

“I’ll do it! I’ll do it!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“I’m an Inner Strength Grandmaster, I’ll do it!”

“What’s the big deal about being an Inner Strength Grandmaster? I’m a peak Inner Strength Grandmaster!”

Qin Yu didn’t expect that the identity of an Elder of the Divine Alchemist pavilion would be so useful!

Originally, he only wanted to borrow the power of Inner Strength Past Masters, but now that there were more than six Inner Strength Grandmasters, it was naturally better to use Inner Strength Grandmasters.

Therefore, Qin Yu selected six Inner Strength Grandmasters and said politely, “Thank you for your help. Please follow me.”

After saying that, Qin Yu shouted to the others, “I will remember the kindness of all of you. If you need me in the future, just let me know.”

“Mr. Qin, you’re too polite!”

“Let us wait here in case you don’t have enough manpower!”

To be able to receive the favor of an Elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion was a huge blessing!

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. After thanking them one by one, he led the few Inner Strength Grandmasters into the Earth Fiend Valley.

After going around in circles, they finally arrived in front of the Resurrection Formation.

The Earth Fiend Valley had a total of ten Resurrection Formations. They had used one last time, so now, there were nine.

“Please sit on each of the six array cores,” Qin Yu said.

The six Inner Strength Grandmasters were extremely cooperative. They immediately sat in six different directions according to Qin Yu’s request.

Then, Qin Yu looked at Jiang Gu and said, “Where’s the body I asked you to find?”

Jiang Gu hurriedly took out a body.

“This is the body of an Inner Strength Grandmaster.” Jiang Gu said.

Qin Yu nodded. He took the body and placed it in the center of the formation.

“You should go and sit down,” Qin Yu said to Jiang Gu.

Jiang Gu nodded and agreed.

Then, Qin Yu took out Old Mister Yan’s body and placed it in the center.

“This... This is Emperor Yan?” Someone seemed to recognize Old Mister Yan’s identity.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, the activation of the Resurrection Formation this time is for Old Mister Yan.”

“Gee, Mr. Qin, why didn’t you say so earlier?!”

“Yes, it’s our honor to be able to serve Emperor Yan!”

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Everyone, don’t waste any more time. Old Mister Yan’s divine sense is about to collapse.”

Everyone hurriedly nodded.

The eight people took their positions. Under Qin Yu’s summoning, the Resurrection Formation began!

Rays of light burst out from the eight people’s bodies!

The light began to condense on the two people’s bodies, then formed a connection of rays of light!

Old Mister Yan’s divine sense slowly left his original body.

Then, his divine sense slowly landed on another body.

The Resurrection Formation lasted for an entire hour before the light gradually dimmed.

“Pu!”

Qin Yu, who was already injured, spat out a mouthful of blood at this moment. His face also turned a little pale.

However, he couldn’t care about his injuries. Instead, he hurriedly walked in front of Old Mister Yan.

Qin Yu, his eyes filled with anxiety, stared at the new body.

Time passed by slowly. At this moment, the eyes of the new body slowly opened.
