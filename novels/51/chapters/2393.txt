2394 The Mark

The space expanded and collapsed completely. Instantly, Qin Yu’s body was covered in numerous scars and injuries. The internal qi alone had already injured his body.

In the third breath, the statue slowly sank into the sea of the Path of Heaven.

As the statue sank deeper, the aura Immortal Emperor Lei emanated became even more terrifying. Qin Yu’s face turned pale as the aura pierced through his skin fiercely and injured his internal organs.

An ordinary cultivator would have lost all his fighting strength at this point.

Qin Yu’s face turned deathly pale. Could the Immortal Emperor be so powerful relying solely on his internal qi?

“The sinking of the Tribulation Third Level Soul Statue is so terrifying. It seems that the body has to slowly fuse with the sea of the Path of Heaven before it can slowly get to the bottom and accept the even purer power of rules.”

Yan Tianshi’s eyes suddenly flashed with a bright light. The internal qi on his body fluctuated violently as if he had comprehended a lot while watching.

Although he did not experience it personally in the immortal grave, the opportunity to watch the evolution of the Immortal Emperor was very rare.

“As expected of the most powerful person under Heavenly Emperor Yan.”

Lei Xin said sincerely. This kind of comprehension was indeed shocking.

In the fourth breath, the sea of space suddenly surged violently, and the statue sank into the bottom of the divine sea. At this moment, the statue was like a vortex, and a massive throne slowly took shape. The statue sat at the bottom of the sea of the Path of Heaven like an emperor.

“Ah!”

Qin Yu slammed both hands forward, and his skin slowly melted.

That was the internal qi on Immortal Emperor Lei’s body. It carried the power of the way that directly shattered Qin Yu’s skin.

As Immortal Emperor Lei breathed, a massive bloody hole suddenly exploded in Qin Yu’s body. His body was riddled with holes in an instant.

“Is this the Tribulation Quadruple-layer condensed power of the throne? Even his breath can destroy the world! Qin Yu’s body can resist the Ni Temple of Heaven’s attack. What a pity!”

Yan Tianshi sighed. In his view, Qin Yu could not hold on any longer. It would be a pity if someone with such talent died in the final trial. He was feeling a little regretful now. If he married Yan Ruoxue, perhaps another terrifying person would appear in the Yan family in times to come.

In the fifth breath, the sand and stones under the throne retreated, and the giant rocks slowly separated.

And an endless abyss was revealed. At the bottom of the endless abyss, there was a dazzling lightning bolt that people could not look straight at.

“Boom!”

The surroundings outside the immortal grave suddenly collapsed!

Everyone was shocked. The power was so strong that even the space around the immortal grave could not withstand it.

Everyone quickly joined forces to support the void and slowly repair the space.

“This kind of power, even I will definitely die inside.”

Yan Tianshi sighed again. With a move of his body, he left Thunder Courtyard with the people of the Yan family.

The people of the Si family also left. The immortal grave had collapsed, so there was no point staying there anymore.

At this moment, Qin Yu discovered in horror that Immortal Emperor Lei’s palm actually evolved into a rune.

It seemed similar to the primordial rune in his space, but the rune evolved by Immortal Emperor Lei was incomparably clear.

In that instant, Qin Yu’s body turned into ashes. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Even his soul completely disappeared.

The origin of thunder, the internal qi that Immortal Emperor Lei evolved was not something that Qin Yu could withstand. He was also not a peerless genius who could use the power of a True Saint to resist the Way of Evolution of the Immortal Emperor.

“Sigh… Did I fail again? I’m sorry, Ruoxue.”

Qin Yu felt he had sunk into boundless darkness and could no longer wake up.

“Qin Yu’s internal qi has disappeared… Lei Xin, you’re too impulsive.”

Flower Granny’s body trembled, and her face revealed a look of utter despair.

Like Lei Xin, even though she felt it difficult, she still thought Qin Yu had a chance.

It was not until Immortal Emperor Lei evolved the primordial rune that she and Lei Xin realized it was a bet they could not win.

The final trial’s goal was to prevent the enemy from obtaining this inheritance and, more importantly, to destroy what Lei Ming had left behind.

It was Immortal Emperor Lei’s ultimate dignity. Even in destruction, he would not allow the enemy to gain anything from him.

“I’m sorry…”

Lei Xin opened his mouth, and his throat moved for a long time before he spat out these words.

“Uncle Lei, don’t blame yourself. This is the path Qin Yu chose. He will be grateful to you for giving him this opportunity.”

In the distance, Yan Ruoxue, in white, was looking at the sky.

She looked very calm, but this calmness made Flower Granny feel uneasy.

In the sky above Thunder Courtyard, thunderclouds had already formed.

Above the massive black thundercloud, five layers of thunderclouds of different colors gathered.

Black, purple, red, blue, yellow, cyan, brown, orange, and white.

Nine different thunderclouds flashed in the sky, emanating a terrifying internal qi. It was the strike that Immortal Emperor Lei wanted to destroy the immortal grave.

It was also Immortal Emperor Lei’s most formidable attack, the Nine Thunder God’s Thunder Technique.

He wanted this deafening sound to tell his last consciousness to bid farewell to this world!

Yan Ruoxue moved slightly and dashed toward the divine thunders of the nine heavens.

“Ruoxue, come back!”

Reinley stretched out and tried to stop her.

“Let her go. What’s the use of living like a living dead if her heart is dead?” Flower Granny said sadly.

“Move everyone from Thunder Courtyard…”

She slowly said these words and turned to leave.

At this moment, in the immortal grave.

Qin Yu’s soul shattered to the last part, and a flash of light suddenly bloomed.

A surge of terrifying internal qi suddenly spread throughout the immortal grave, and countless powers of the way suddenly squeezed out from the immortal grave.

The green mark emanated an obscure fluctuation. In the next moment, time seemed to have reversed.

Qin Yu collapsed in front of the immortal grave unscathed. Immortal Emperor Lei slowly put down the hands that he raised.

The clouds in the nine heavens outside the immortal grave suddenly shattered, and Flower Granny suddenly pulled Yan Ruoxue back.

“Ruoxue, I felt like sensing Qin Yu’s internal qi again!”

Flower Granny revealed a look of disbelief. She did not know what was going on.

“The Reincarnation Mark!”

Qin Yu suddenly realized that the mark left by Jun Yixian when they parted was something that could save his life.

“Whizz!”

All of a sudden, a giant finger suddenly entered Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

A dazzling bead was left in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness. After that, Immortal Emperor Lei’s body slowly collapsed.

“In the past, heaven and earth were divided, and all things were nurtured. The Pure Jade True King focused on the golden palace, gazed down with compassion for all living beings drifting in the sea of suffering, wandering through life and death, enduring countless cycles of grievances and wrongs, oppressed by evil forces. Those who inherit my legacy should wield my thunder to protect my clan!”

With the disappearance of the final sentence, Immortal Emperor Lei completely vanished, and even the last bit of consciousness of once the Immortal Emperor no longer existed.

“Immortal Emperor Lei, I will wield your name to awe the world and not let you down!”

Qin Yu said to himself.

The heaven and earth shook violently, and the immortal grave began to collapse.

A vortex suddenly appeared and sucked Qin Yu out.
