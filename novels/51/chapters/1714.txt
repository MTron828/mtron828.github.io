Chapter 1715: Chapter 1,715, killing everyone Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“It’s the great Yue Mountain,”Qin Yu said in shock.

He raised his head to look at the terrifying phenomenon in the sky, and he couldn’t help but feel a little excited.

In the entire great Yue Mountain, there was only one person who could step into the reversion void stage, and that was Wen wanye!

“I’m finally going to step into the reversion void stage.”Qin Yu’s heart was faintly excited.

Wen Wanye was Qin Yu’s master, and his personality was extremely straightforward.

Most importantly, he had stepped into the reversion void stage, and he would definitely stand out to deal with the northern lands!

Wen wanye was different from other reversion void stage cultivators. His strength was already incomparably powerful, and now that he had stepped into the reversion void stage, he would definitely have a great battle prowess!

Qin Yu raised his head to look at the extremely terrifying phenomenon in the sky, and his heart grew increasingly excited.

As time passed, thick bolts of lightning fell from the sky and crashed toward the great Yue Mountain!

However, the great Yue mountain was the homeland of a great cultivator at the tribulation stage. When the heavenly tribulation descended, it actually shone with the light of talismans and protected the great Yue mountain.

“This great Yue mountain is indeed not simple,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He was not in a hurry to leave. He just sat there, quietly waiting for Wen Wanyi to complete his breakthrough.

At this time, Wen Da and Wen Er also ran over eagerly.

They stood beside Qin Yu, pointed at the heavenly tribulation and said, “Look, my grandfather is about to break through!”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “With master’s ability, stepping into the return to void is not surprising.”

“He won’t fail to transcend the Heavenly Tribulation, right?”At this moment, Wen da suddenly muttered.

Qin Yu glared at Wen Da and said, “Don’t talk nonsense. With master’s ability, it’s difficult for him to transcend the Heavenly Tribulation.”

“That’s right, that’s right.”Wen Er, who was beside him, also echoed.

Wen da shrank his neck and didn’t dare to say anything more.

Time passed by minute by minute. The three of them sat on the peak of the mountain, waiting for Wen Wanji’s breakthrough.

After an unknown period of time, the terrifying heavenly tribulation still did not disappear.

This made Qin Yu even more excited, because the more terrifying the heavenly tribulation, the more powerful it was!

Wen Wanji’s heavenly tribulation far surpassed the other reversion void stage cultivators!

The sky gradually darkened, and the strange phenomenon in the sky finally began to disappear.

After welcoming the last heavenly tribulation, the strange phenomenon disappeared without a trace.

The Sky returned to its calm state, and a ray of light shot through the sky. The sky was filled with stars, signifying an extremely beautiful meaning.

Qin Yu’s eyes looked in the direction of Wen Wanji’s tribulation.

At this moment, Wen Wanji’s clothes had been torn to shreds, and his entire body was leaking out extremely sturdy muscles.

His appearance was much younger than before, and the aura that he emitted was even more terrifying than internal Qi!

Qin Yu didn’t think too much and immediately planned to rush in the direction of Wen Wanji.

“Hey, bring the two of us!”At this time, Wen Da and Wen er hurriedly shouted.

Qin Yu nodded. He brought Wen Da and Wen Er and rushed in the direction of Wen Wanji.

By the time the unspecialized arrived here, Wen Wanji had already restrained the internal Qi in his body.

He looked at the three people and grinned, “Already here? That’s pretty fast.”

Qin Yu walked forward excitedly, cupped his hands, and said, “Congratulations, master, for stepping into the reversion void stage!”

Wen Wanji waved his hand and said, “There’s nothing to congratulate. It’s just a trivial matter. But speaking of which, I’m quite happy. I can finally go deal with those B * stards from the northern lands.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Yes, I also have the same intention.”

At this time, Wen Wanyun noticed the change in Qin Yu’s internal Qi. He was slightly surprised and said, “You broke through?”

Qin Yu grunted and said, “I was lucky enough to step into the later stage of the Almighty Realm.”

“Not bad, not bad. This is a happy occasion. Oh, no, it should be a double happiness. We must have a good drink!”Wen wanyun said excitedly. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Yes, yes, yes, we must drink it until we are completely drunk!”Wen Da and Wen Er also said.

Qin Yu did not want to spoil their mood, so he could only agree.

The group of four arrived at the Wen family’s palace and began to drink.

After three rounds of wine and five different dishes, just as the few of them were extremely excited, a voice suddenly came from outside.

“Someone is here.”Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Wen wanyun waved his hand and said, “They are definitely here to congratulate me! No need to think too much! Besides, who am I afraid of Now?”

Very soon, the people outside walked in.

At a glance, there were several hundred people!

Not only that, Qin Yu felt that these people’s faces were somewhat familiar.

“The northern border?”Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly, and he suddenly realized something.

“Congratulations, senior Wen, for stepping into the reversion void stage!”At this moment, someone took the lead and cupped his hands.

Following that, everyone followed suit and shouted, “Congratulations, senior Wen, for stepping into the reversion void stage!”

Wen wanji said cheerfully, “Thank you, thank you. We are all guests here, so please quickly take your seats.”

However, at this moment, the conversation of this group of people changed.

One of the leaders walked forward and cupped his hands towards Wen wanji, “Senior, apart from congratulating you, I also have a favor to ask of you.”

“Oh?”Wen Wanji raised his brows. He was in the mood to drink and immediately waved his hand. “Speak! As long as I can do it, I won’t hesitate!”

“We plan to invite senior to go to the northern lands and kill that elementalist who has yet to be fully resurrected!”The leader said coldly.

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

As expected, this group of people actually targeted Wen Wanji.

“Senior, that elementalist has yet to fully resurrect, and the two reversion void stage cultivators in the northern region have already been heavily injured by the explosion. As long as you head to the Northern Region, you will definitely be able to kill that Elementalist!”

“That’s right. In this way, the southern region will be able to avoid this disaster, and you will be the hero of the Southern Region!”

Wen Wanji remained silent. He frowned slightly, and no one knew what he was thinking about.

A moment later, Wen wanji said, “This is indeed a good choice. I know that many people have already died fighting for the southern region.”

When everyone heard this, they were instantly overjoyed. “I knew that senior would definitely agree. Thank you, Senior!”

“Master, absolutely not.”At this moment, Qin Yu stood up and stopped Wen Wanji.

Wen wanji frowned and said, “Why not? That northern region is only a virtual city now. It’s a good opportunity to get rid of that Elementalist.”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “But there’s still he teng in the northern lands. This he teng is my fellow countryman. I have a good understanding of him. His strength can not be underestimated.”

“Most importantly, he still has the Hunter Club of the hunter organization in his hands. Not long ago, a person at the reversion void stage died at his hands.”

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, the surrounding people could not help but snort softly, “That person at the reversion void stage did indeed die at the hands of He Teng. But can he be compared to senior Wen?”

“That’s right. If senior Wen were to make a move, killing him would be effortless!”

“Don’t forget, that he teng is only in the mighty realm. How can he compare to Senior Wen Wanyi? Senior Wen could kill him with just a raise of his hand!”
