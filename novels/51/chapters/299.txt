Chapter 300: Encounter Fang Yue Again Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The herbs in the Peach Blossom City were almost famous all over the country.

Therefore, the Divine Alchemist Pavilion would hold a Herbs Convention in the Peach Blossom City every year.

Although it was called a Herbs Convention, it was actually an exchange convention.

Those who came to participate in this Herbs Convention could exchange herbs for a treasure of equal value.

As the King of Medicine, Dong Tianhai naturally participated every year.

After that, Dong Tianhai went to the warehouse to make some preparations for the Herbs Convention that night.

At this moment, Qin Yu and Yao Qing were rushing towards Peach Blossom City.

“Mr. Qin, do you think Dong Tianhai will give us the herbs obediently?” Yao Qing muttered as he drove.

Qin Yu closed his eyes and said indifferently, “He has to give it no matter what.”

In any case, Qin Yu was now in control of the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique. Even if something unexpected really happened, he could still run away.

When Qin Yu and the others reached Peach Blossom City, it was already seven o’clock in the evening.

“Let’s find a place to eat first,” Qin Yu said as he rubbed his stomach.

“That’s exactly what I’m thinking!” Yao Qing hurriedly nodded.

The two of them found a restaurant and stopped. Then, Qin Yu handed the menu to Yao Qing and asked him to order the dishes.

Updates by

About half an hour later, the dishes were all ready.

Qin Yu looked down at the dishes on the table and couldn’t help but sigh.

“There are herbs in these dishes. As expected of Peach Blossom City,” said Qin Yu.

Yao Qing muttered, “Can it taste good with herbs?”

“Young man, you don’t understand.” At this moment, the owner walked over.

He sat at the side and explained with a smile, “The development of herbs in Peach Blossom City can be said to be top-notch!”

“These herbs can not only bring benefits to the body, but also give the dishes a delicious taste. You Can’t eat them anywhere else!”

Yao Qing said with some doubt, “Really? You’re not bragging?”

“Hey, if you don’t believe me, you can try it!” The owner said helplessly.

Yao Qing picked up a mouthful of food with some suspicion.

“Huh? The taste is really good!” Yao Qing’s eyes lit up, and then he began to wolf down his food.

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh.

The owner said with some pride, “How is it? I didn’t lie to you, did I?”

Qin Yu said jokingly, “He hasn’t seen the world before. Don’t mind him.”

“Gee, don’t say that. All people who come to Peach Blossom City from out of town will have this kind of doubt. I have already gotten used to it.” The owner waved his hand.

At this point, the owner said, “You are also here to participate in the Herbs Convention, right?”

“Herbs Convention?” Qin Yu was stunned.

“What is the Herbs Convention?”

The owner said with some surprise, “You don’t know? This Herbs Convention is organized by the Divine Alchemist Pavilion! And every year, the Divine Alchemist Pavilion will take out a stalk of top-grade herbs!”

Qin Yu’s eyes immediately lit up. There was actually such a marvelous thing?

Regarding the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, Qin Yu had already been filled with curiosity.

He didn’t expect that he would coincidentally have the opportunity to participate in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s event today.

“Owner, when will it start?” Qin Yu hurriedly asked.

The owner glanced at his watch and said, “About half an hour later.”

When he heard this, Qin Yu hurriedly pulled Yao Qing and said, “Don’t eat anymore. Let’s hurry up and leave!”

“I’m not full yet.” Yao Qing muttered as he stuffed the food into his mouth.

“I’ll let you have a full meal when it’s over.” Qin Yu hurriedly pulled Yao Qing out of the restaurant. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The event held by the Divine Alchemist Pavilion was naturally a huge event. Almost everyone in Peach Blossom City knew about it.

Qin Yu found someone to inquire and found out that the venue of the Herbs Convention was a place called Longevity Village.

Therefore, Qin Yu drove towards Longevity Village.

Longevity Village was just like its name. Rumor had it that the average life expectancy of the people in Longevity Village was more than 100 years old.

Many rich people would come to Longevity Village to retire.

When Qin Yu and Yao Qing arrived, the Herbs Convention had already begun.

The huge village had practically become a market!

High-aged herbs could be seen everywhere, and the price was extremely low!

Qin Yu casually picked up a stalk, and its age was 50 years old.

“Owner, how much are these herbs?” Qin Yu asked.

The owner waved his hand and said, “It’s 500,000 yuan per stalk. If you want more, you can get a discount.”

Qin Yu instantly felt a myriad of mixed emotions.

This price was simply ridiculously low!

No wonder Dong Tianhai could sell herbs to Xiong Yi in large quantities back then. It was because there was no shortage of them in Peach Blossom City!

“Huh? The price Xiong Yi bought it for... seems to be as high as a million, right?” Qin Yu rubbed his chin and said.

Yao Qing nodded and said, “That’s right. Dong Tianhai is really sinister. By the way, when are we going to find Dong Tianhai?”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “there’s no rush. I believe that Dong Tianhai will definitely appear at such an occasion.”

After saying that, Qin Yu brought Yao Qing and strolled around the medicinal Herbs Convention.

“Mr. Qin, we meet again.” At this moment, a seductive voice sounded from behind.

Qin Yu turned around and saw that it was Fang Yue!

She was still as seductive as before. Her entire body exuded an irresistible charm. Her sexy figure made people want to bang her right then and there.

Just as Qin Yu was about to greet her, a familiar voice sounded.

“Mr. Qin, I didn’t expect you to be here.”

After turning around, he found that it was Jing Lu, who was known as the leader of the four great geniuses of Jiang Bei.

Jing Lu had a nonchalant smile on his face. There was a hint of viciousness hidden in the depths of his eyes.

Qin Yu could naturally sense the hostility from him, so he smiled and said, “Is your knee healed?”

When he heard this, the veins on Jing Lu’s face suddenly bulged!

He glared at Qin Yu and said through gritted teeth, “Thanks to you, it’s already healed! But your life span is longer than I imagined.”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said, “Are you threatening me?”

“I don’t dare to. You are the famous King of Chuzhou. Who dares to threaten you?” Jing Lu said in a sarcastic tone.

After saying this, he turned around and left.

“Mr. Qin, this is Jiang Bei after all. You’d better be careful.” Fang Yue covered her mouth and laughed lightly.

Qin Yu bowed slightly and said, “Thank you for your reminder, Miss Fang.”

Fang Yue nodded and said, “If there’s anything, remember to call me. I’m ready to help you at any time.”

These words made people’s hearts skip a beat.

Yao Qing, who was standing at the side, widened his eyes and almost drooled.

Looking at Fang Yue’s back, Qin Yu couldn’t help but stroke his chin.

“Fang Yue isn’t as simple as she seems,” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

The last time they met, Qin Yu felt that Fang Yue had a natural charm that was hard to resist.

Now, Qin Yu’s eyes were several times sharper than before.

This time, when he saw Fang Yue, Qin Yu could feel the strange charm on her body.

This kind of charm didn’t only come from her beautiful appearance, but also seemed to come from the bottom of her heart and divine sense.

...

“Mr. Jing, you’re not planning to make a move on Qin Yu, are you?” Fang Yue said after she caught up with Jing Lu.

Jing Lu said with a gloomy expression, “What do you think?”

Fang Yue’s beautiful eyes flickered, and her voice was charming as she said, “Mr. Jing, there’s no deep hatred between you and Qin Yu. Why don’t you let it go on account of me?”

When he heard this, Jing Lu couldn’t help but sneer. “Why? Even a vixen like you has a time when you fall for someone?”
