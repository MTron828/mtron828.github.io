Chapter 987: Chapter 987, the Furious Qin Yu

In the dark, many people had already begun to target Qin Yu.

But Qin Yu still didn’t care.

After a whole day, almost no one was willing to get close to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu entered more than ten shops, but only three of the shop owners were willing to receive Qin Yu.

“Sigh.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh slightly.

The handlebar mustache on the side was even more vexed.

“Don’t these people have brains? Can’t they think for themselves?”The handlebar mustache said angrily.

Qin Yu said helplessly, “For them, you can’t ask them to think too much. Moreover, they should be afraid.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The handlebar mustache waved his hand and said, “Then I don’t care. The point is that this will delay my treasure hunt too much. It’s not easy to hold a hundred spirits meeting.”

Qin Yu kicked the mustached man and scolded him with a smile, “Alright, I won’t accompany you tomorrow. Come out by yourself.”

“That’s more like it,”the mustached man muttered.

After returning to his residence, Qin Yu sat on the rocking chair and basked in the Sun. He closed his eyes slightly, looking quite relaxed.

“From Tomorrow onwards, you will go out by yourself. However, you have to give me some of the treasures you get,”Qin Yu said with his eyes slightly closed.

The mustached man glared and said, “Why should I?”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “If you don’t agree, I’ll go with you tomorrow. You won’t receive anything.”

“You... Alright,”the mustached man said helplessly.

“But I’m telling you, I have to distribute the things.”

“No problem.”Qin Yu nodded.

“If you can receive a stalk of heavenly vanilla for me, that would be the best.”

The mustached man mumbled, “Heavenly Vanilla, heavenly vanilla, where can I get you a stalk of heavenly vanilla...”

...

The next day.

The mustached man woke up early. After he greeted Qin Yu, he left the hotel on his own to look for treasures.

Qin Yu, on the other hand, was lying on the bed, looking rather relaxed.

“It’s said that there’s a stalk of heavenly vanilla in the second mystery realm. I wonder if it’s true,”Qin Yu muttered softly.

Qin Yu had considered asking tie Dan to go to the second mystery land to pick a heavenly vanilla for him. However, Qin Yu was still worried about tie Dan.

“Forget it. I will look for it first. If I really can’t find it, I will think of another way,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

At noon.

The man with the handlebar mustache rushed back from outside.

His head was full of big bumps and his hair was messy. He looked extremely pathetic.

Qin Yu suddenly stood up and said, “What’s going on?”

The mustached man angrily said, “These people are crazy! They are sure that you did it and beat me up when they see me! If I didn’t run fast, I’m afraid I would have been beaten to death by them!”

Qin Yu’s expression immediately became a little ugly.

He sat up from the bed and said coldly, “They attacked you?”

“That’s right. If you were here, they would have attacked you,”the moustache man mumbled.

Qin Yu frowned.

He had thought that these people would suspect him, but he had never thought that they would attack the moustache man.

“The few shops we went to yesterday, the bosses who didn’t receive us all died last night,”the moustache man said in a deep voice.

“Not only that, but one of your hats was also left at the scene. Now they are sure that you killed them.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath.

Hat? He was referring to thousand faces?

But thousand faces Qin Yu had always kept it in his spatial artifact.

“They really went to great lengths to frame me.”Qin Yu took a deep breath and said in a deep voice.

The mustached man sighed and said, “I’m afraid these people have gone crazy. Let’s hurry up and leave.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He took out his phone and opened the martial arts forum.

He saw that the forum was discussing this matter.

“This person is probably really Qin Yu. Qin Yu has used such a technique before!”

“I have a video here to prove it!”

“This technique is exactly the same as Qin Yu’s!”

“Look, the hat that was left behind at the scene, is it the one that Qin Yu wore before? !”

“Impossible, how could Qin Yu do such a thing? Back then, he risked his life to fight against the Sky Blood Rainbow!”

“Hehe, a dragon-slaying warrior eventually turns into an evil dragon. Besides, who knows if he acted because he was afraid that the Sky Blood Rainbow would steal his resources?”

Looking at the comments on the Forum, Qin Yu’s expression became even uglier.

“I still underestimated them,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

The development of the matter had completely exceeded Qin Yu’s imagination.

Now, almost everyone did not believe him. This was something Qin Yu did not expect.

Just as Qin Yu was deep in thought, a sound suddenly came from outside.

Qin Yu leaned against the window and took a look. He found that the outside was already filled with people.

Although they did not make a big fuss, their intentions were very obvious.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said in a low voice, “They actually came looking for us?”

“See, I told you. These people don’t know what’s good for them!”The Mustache Man muttered.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, then said, “Wait for me here. I’ll go down and take a look.”

The mustache man muttered, “Why are you still going down? These people won’t listen to your explanation.”

Qin Yu sighed and said, “Then I can’t hide here and not say a word. Moreover, I’m sitting upright, so I’m not afraid of them.”

After saying that, Qin Yu turned around and walked downstairs.

The people downstairs were discussing something in a low voice. When they saw Qin Yu, everyone held their breath, and it was terrifyingly quiet.

Qin Yu glanced at these people and said as politely as possible, “May I know why everyone is looking for me?”

Everyone looked at each other. A moment later, someone suddenly shouted, “Qin Yu, so many people have died. Don’t you think you should explain it to us?”

“That’s right! These people’s methods are exactly the same as yours. Did you do it or not?”

“Although we are weak, we still have the qualifications to know the truth!”

Qin Yu looked at everyone and said in a deep voice, “I didn’t kill them.”

“You didn’t kill him? Then who else could it be? You have something at the scene!”

“The method of killing is exactly the same as yours. You said you didn’t kill him?”

“Stop pretending to be a good person!”

Hearing the comments of the crowd, Qin Yu’s heart was suddenly filled with anger.

“I said, I didn’t kill him!”Qin Yu said coldly.

“Of course you won’t admit it! Whoever killed him will admit it themselves!”

“Someone said that they saw you at the scene of the murder!”

“If you are a man, then come out. Don’t you dare to admit it!”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “If I want to kill them, why wait until midnight to do it? Do you think you are my opponents?”

A loud roar was like thunder, shaking everyone’s ears until they felt pain.

They unconsciously took a step back, a trace of fear flashed across their faces.
