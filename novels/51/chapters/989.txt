Chapter 990: Chapter 990, a blessing in disguise!

All along, Qin Yu had always felt that he was a little far from finding his own Daoist technique.

After experiencing this incident, Qin Yu had finally found his own Daoist technique.

“I really didn’t expect that I would actually find a blessing in disguise.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

His Daoist technique was to kill the righteous path!

Only by killing decisively could one step into the martial saint realm!

And Qin Yu would also cultivate on this path until the end!

“Kill the Righteous Path?”

Tie Dan seemed to have guessed something. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Qin Yu replied, “Although my dao technique is similar to yours, they are not of the same lineage.”

Tie Dan sneered, “How do you know that our dao techniques are different?”

“Although I also rely on killing the righteous path, I won’t kill the innocent. I just shouldn’t be merciful,”Qin Yu said lightly.

“After all, I still care about the common people.”

Tie Dan snorted lightly and did not reply.

Qin Yu did not pay any more attention to tie Dan. A trace of excitement appeared on his face.

“In this way, I am only one stalk of heavenly vanilla away from becoming a martial saint,”Qin Yu said in his heart.

After he finished speaking, Qin Yu thought of Tie Dan.

Thus, he shouted in his mind, “Tie Dan, with your ability, it should not be a problem to defeat a martial saint, right?”

“Martial saint? You’re underestimating me too much.”Tie Dan sneered.

“Although I can’t use my full strength with your body, I’m still at the peak of the Almighty Realm after all. A martial saint isn’t even worth mentioning in my eyes.”

Qin Yu hummed and said, “I need your help now. Help me go to the second secret realm to find a heavenly vanilla.”

“Heavenly Vanilla?”Tie Dan frowned slightly.

“Did your Jindan leave a hidden disease?”

Qin yuen nodded and said, “If I can’t get the Heavenly Vanilla, I won’t be able to enter the martial Saint Realm.”

“Indeed,”tie Dan said.

“If the Jindan is damaged and can’t be repaired, once you face the martial saint’s Heavenly Tribulation, it’s very likely that you will become a cripple.”

At this point, tie Dan changed the topic and continued, “But the heavenly vanilla usually only grows in high-level mystic realms. The second mystic realm that you mentioned is probably just an ordinary mystic realm.”

“High-level Mystic Realm?”Qin Yu frowned slightly.

“What do you mean?”

Tie Dan explained, “Although they are both mystic realms, there is a huge difference between mystic realms and mystic realms.”

“For example, high-level mystic realms and low-level mystic realms are not the same world at all.”

Qin Yu hurriedly explained, “The second mystic realm is quite big. It should not be an ordinary mystic realm.”

“Not an ordinary mystic realm? Do you know what a high-level mystic realm means?”Iron Egg’s tone carried a hint of ridicule.

“Let me give you an example. A mighty figure can create an ordinary mystic realm, but a high-level mystic realm needs to be created by a top-notch cultivator who is in the tribulation-transcending realm

“A real high-grade mystic realm’s world isn’t any worse than the current world! That’s a real world!”

Qin Yu’s expression didn’t look too good when he heard tie Dan’s words.

Although the second mystic realm was huge, it definitely couldn’t be created by a great cultivator in the tribulation transcending realm.

Moreover, the second mystic realm could be said to be worlds apart when compared to the real world.

“In that case... there won’t be any heavenly vanilla in the second mystic realm.”Qin Yu’s expression was a little ugly.

Iron egg nodded and said, “99% there won’t be. I advise you to give up on this idea.”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Do you have a way to get the heavenly vanilla?”

“No,”iron egg said without hesitation.

This immediately gave Qin Yu a headache.

Everything was ready, only the east wind was needed. However, he had never expected that he would still be stuck at the heavenly vanilla.

At this moment, Qin Yu felt a trace of murderous intent approaching.

“Martial Saint?”Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Then, he hurriedly stood up, executed the line word formula, and turned around to leave.

He had originally planned to go to the nine pinnacles mountain. However, on second thought, he had already implicated Jiang he and Xu Huaigu too many times.

This time, it had caused even more public anger. He was afraid that the two of them would not be able to protect themselves.

“I can only temporarily set foot on the road of escape.”Qin Yu only stopped after he had fled for dozens of miles.

In this way, Qin Yu could not even stay in a hotel and could only stay in the wilderness.

In the next few days, Qin Yu was on the road of escape.

The various great mystery realms had sent out martial saints one after another, vowing to kill Qin Yu with their lives.

On the martial arts forum, there was even more clamor.

Although one could occasionally see people speaking up for Qin Yu, they would soon be suppressed.

In the blink of an eye, a week had passed.

During this week, Qin Yu was either on the run or on the road of escape.

Although he had been discovered many times, he was still able to escape with the help of the “Xing”formula.

“This is not the way to go on.”Qin Yu sighed slightly.

At this moment, he suddenly thought of a place.

Shan Nan Village! It was also the mountain village where Yu Qin was!

Back when Qin Yu was heavily injured, it was precisely in Shan nan village that he managed to escape!

Not only that, Shan nan village was more like a paradise that was hard to find!

Thinking of this, Qin Yu followed his memory and rushed to the mountain south village.

Everything in the mountain south village was the same as before.

Even though the “Old immortal”was killed by Qin Yu, Yu Qin still went to the mountain forest to pick herbs every day.

She followed the Prescription Qin Yu left for her and practiced her medical skills all day. Soon, she became a famous doctor in the mountain south village, even surpassing her father.

With the support of her superb medical skills, Yu Qin’s life was not bad. However, whenever she was free, she would think of Qin Yu, whom she had only met for three days.

“Xiao Qin, I don’t know what’s wrong with my arm. It keeps hurting. Please help me take a look,”an old man said with a trembling voice.

Yu Qin quickly came back to her senses and said with a gentle smile, “Uncle Li, please wait a moment. I’ll go and get the medicine for you.”

In the dark.

Qin Yu had already arrived near the mountain south village.

He looked at Yu Qin who was not far away and said with some satisfaction, “It seems that you are doing quite well.”

“Kid, you are always lenient.”Tie bin rolled his eyes and said.

“Screw you. I don’t have that kind of intention towards her.”Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said.

Just when he was about to walk out and greet Yu Qin, three cars suddenly stopped at the door.

As soon as the cars stopped, he saw five people walk out.

“Three Martial Saints!”

Qin Yu’s expression instantly changed drastically!

Three martial saints and two martial marquis got out of the cars! One of them was Zeng Ji!

Such power was enough to wipe out everything!

Zeng ji strode forward and said coldly, “You guys know Qin Yu, right?”

When Yu Qin heard the name that she had been longing for day and night, her eyes instantly lit up. She said with some excitement and shyness, “I know him! Are... are you guys Qin Yu’s friends?”

Zeng Ji narrowed his eyes and asked coldly, “Has Qin Yu been here before?”

Yu Qin shook her head and whispered, “He hasn’t been here for a long time...”

Zeng ji sized Yu Qin up and sneered, “It seems that your relationship with Qin Yu is not ordinary.”

“You... Don’t talk nonsense! I... I’m just friends with Qin Yu...”Yu Qin’s voice became softer and softer, and a hint of shyness appeared on her face unconsciously.

Seeing this, Zeng Ji immediately laughed and said, “Well, this woman and Qin Yu definitely have a special relationship!”

Then, he looked around and said coldly, “I’m officially informing you that if I don’t see Qin Yu within three days, your village... will not be spared!”

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically!

“You’re courting death!”A hint of anger flashed across Qin Yu’s face!
