Chapter 1105: Chapter 1105, facing an ancient mighty figure 

Yun Long’s expression was extremely cold. He took a step forward, and his internal Qi instantly erupted.

This internal Qi was like a landmine exploding in front of everyone, causing them to take a few steps back.

Just the residual power alone made people feel a trace of fear.

“Do you think that’s possible? Scram immediately!”Yun long shouted.

Qin Yu stood there without moving. He looked at Yun long in front of him and said, “I don’t want to be your enemy, and I don’t want to take your strange flower by force. However, if you don’t do it for yourself, Heaven and Earth will destroy you. Today, I must take the strange flower with me.”

It took him five whole days to reach the island. For Qin Yu, he couldn’t afford to waste any time.

There was only one month left. If he couldn’t improve his cultivation base, he would die at the hands of the higher-ups. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Therefore, no matter what the reason was, Qin Yu would never give up on this strange flower.

“Then there’s no need to talk nonsense. Let’s talk after I kill you.”Yun long stepped forward.

Qin Yu’s internal Qi was also rolling rapidly. Golden light shone in all directions, illuminating more than half of the Cloud Dragon Island.

A great battle was about to break out. The cultivation of this cloud dragon was unfathomable. Even Qin Yu could not see through it.

Yao Meng and the others also quickly moved forward, getting ready to fight.

“Buzz!”

At this moment, a snow-white internal Qi was emitted from the body of the Cloud Dragon. The internal Qi swirled in his hand, as if he had plucked auspicious clouds from the sky.

In the next second, the body of the cloud dragon slowly disappeared without a trace!

Qin Yu frowned slightly. Just as he was about to speak, he felt that something strange was coming from his back!

“Bang!”

A hand suddenly appeared from the void behind Qin Yu! The palm was like a Dragon Claw, fiercely clawing at Qin Yu’s Back!

This extremely sharp finger broke through Qin Yu’s defense in one go, and several bloody marks instantly appeared on his body!

Qin Yu hurriedly turned around, but discovered that there was nothing behind him!

“Not good, this person has extremely deep control over spatial spells!”Yao Meng exclaimed in shock.

Qin Yu’s expression could not help but change.

To have such control over spatial spells was truly shocking.

Qin Yu hurriedly released his divine sense, attempting to find the figure of the cloud dragon.

However, he was surprised to discover that his divine sense was completely unable to discover the Cloud Dragon!

Hidden in the void, it was as if the connection had been severed. Divine sense could not penetrate the void to see through his true body!

“Boom!”

At this moment, Yun Long struck out from the void. The massive qi energy directly pushed everyone back!

As the Guardian Demonic Beast of the Cloud Dragon Island, his strength did not need to be said. The power of his palm was even more shocking!

Under this palm strike, not only Qin Yu, Chang Mang and the others were also forced back!

Other than Chang Mang and Qin Yu, the others were all severely injured. Even their internal organs were impacted.

“F * ck!”

Kong Yun could not help but be furious. He took out his long spear and stabbed into the void.

A powerful internal Qi surged, causing a hurricane to blow across the entire Cloud Dragon Island. However, the long spear could not hurt the cloud dragon at all!

“Boom!”

The cloud dragon extended two large hands from the void, activating the radiance as it ruthlessly crushed down!

“Go to hell!”

Chang Mang roared furiously as he clenched his fist to receive the attack. A blood-red radiance erupted, causing the entire flower field to tremble!

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed. He seized this opportunity to smash his fist into the Void!

Although Yun long quickly withdrew his palm, he was still injured under the cooperation of the two of them. Bloody Marks appeared on his palm.

His body shrank back into the empty space again, and there was no movement for a long time.

“Come out and fight if you have the ability. What kind of ability is hiding!”Chang Mang shouted.

Qin Yu didn’t say a word. While everyone was panicking, he and Yao Meng unconsciously looked at each other.

Their gazes met, and it seemed as if they had the same thought.

Yun Long’s strength was definitely not limited to this. Although his palm strikes were full of strength, they didn’t have any fatal ability.

As the Guardian Beast of the Cloud Dragon Island, his strength was naturally self-evident. This was enough to prove that he had been holding back.

The reason why he held back was naturally not because of Qin Yu and the others’personal charm. There was only one possibility, and that was that he was afraid of destroying this flower field!

Thinking up to this point, Qin Yu and Yao Meng exploded at the same time. Both of their palms faintly emitted an extremely destructive power.

“Since we can’t take this strange flower away, then we might as well destroy it!”Qin Yu said coldly.

That power condensed in his palms, and the two of them exploded at the same time. The Divine Rainbow and golden light fused together and headed straight for the flower field!

“You’re courting death!”

Yun Long’s voice immediately spread out from the void. His body sped through the void and quickly stood on the flower field. He raised his two injured palms and faced this power!

“Boom!”

Yun long used his internal Qi to protect the flower field while he attacked the joint attack of the two of them. This immediately caused his strength to be greatly reduced.

“Bang!”

The moment the palms collided, it was immediately scarlet red. His two palms seemed to have exploded into bloody flowers. It was a tragic sight!

Qin Yu and Yao Meng looked at each other and sneered, “It worked.”

After saying that, Qin Yu looked at Chang Mang and the others and shouted, “Yao Meng and I will hold Yun long back. You guys go and pick the strange flowers!”

“Okay!”Chang Mang and the others also reacted and rushed towards the flower field.

“You’re courting death!”Yun Long’s furious voice rang out from the void. In the next second, his physical body appeared in front of everyone.

Qin Yu coldly said, “You haven’t stepped into the Almighty Realm, so you’re definitely not a match for the two of us.”

Yao Meng’s strength was unfathomable. Even Qin Yu didn’t dare to guarantee a 100% victory over her.

As for Qin Yu, he had the strength to challenge an Almighty. The two of them working together was unimaginable!

Yun Long’s entire body emitted an extremely cold aura. He looked coldly at the two of them and said, “Then let’s give it a try!”

Just as the two sides were about to erupt into a great battle, a leisurely voice was transmitted from a valley deep within the flower fields.

“Stop.”That voice was rolling like thunder, extremely old.

Hearing this voice, a trace of respect flashed across Yun Long’s face.

He hurriedly turned around and cupped his hands. “Master.”

Qin Yu and Yao Meng frowned.

“It’s the voice of that Almighty,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.
