Chapter 1277: Chapter 1,277, closing the city gates! 

This person walked like a dragon and a tiger. Every breath he took was extraordinary.

He was none other than the owner of this stone gambling shop.

The owner walked in front of Qin Yu, cupped his hands and said, “Friend, our shop sincerely takes back this item... how about five million spirit coins?”

Hearing this number, everyone couldn’t help but gasp!

Five million spirit coins! This was simply a fortune!

This number, even for Qin Yu, was full of temptation.

However, he was silent for a moment, but still shook his head and said, “I’m sorry, I also need this item.”

The boss smiled and said, “Friend, name a price.”

Qin Yu said helplessly, “It’s not about the price. It’s just that I urgently need this item, so no matter how much it is, it’s impossible.”

“Hehe, how do you know it’s impossible without a price? Everything has its price,”the boss said indifferently.

Seeing that he was so insistent, Qin Yu said, “Alright then... 100 million spirit coins, how about it?”

As soon as he said this, the boss’face immediately turned green.

He said with a dark face, “Friend, are you kidding me?”

Qin Yu said helplessly, “You asked me to make an offer. How can you blame it on Me?”

The boss narrowed his eyes slightly. He put his face close to Qin Yu’s ear and whispered, “Friend, you made so much money in my shop, and now you still don’t give me face. Have you thought about the consequences?”

Hearing this, Qin Yu didn’t say anything and snatched the spirit refining clothes.

“I hate it when people threaten me,”Qin Yu said with a cold smile.

A trace of viciousness flashed in the owner’s eyes. He raised his hand to Pat Qin Yu’s shoulder, but Qin Yu mercilessly pushed him away.

This made him, who was already embarrassed, even more embarrassed.

“Okay, okay. I’ll remember you,”the owner said coldly.

Qin Yu also knew that it was not good to stay here for long, so he turned around and left with Guan Zhuang.

“Big Brother Guan Zhuang, I’ll leave the matter of purchasing equipment to you.”Qin Yu took out a card of 500,000 and handed it to Guan Zhuang.

“There’s 500,000 in this card. Buy some good equipment for everyone.”

Guan Zhuang said in surprise, “The leader only gave 300,000, you...”

“I’ll pay for the rest,”Qin Yu said.

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and was about to leave.

At this time, Guan Zhuang pulled Qin Yu and said, “Where are you going?”

“I have a bad feeling,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“There’s no time to explain. I’ll wait for you outside the city.”

After saying this, Qin Yu hurriedly ran out of Gu City.

Qin Yu had always been extremely sensitive to danger.

At this moment, he also felt that something was wrong.

In addition, the young master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect had already arrived at Gu City, so it was better to leave as soon as possible.

Guan Zhuang thought that Qin Yu was worried about the owner of the stone gambling shop, so he didn’t think too much about it.

Just as Qin Yu left Gu City in a hurry, the Heavenly Cloud sect issued a kill order.

Not only that, the entire city was announced to be closed. The city lord sent out heavy troops to guard every exit. .. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Apart from that, they also activated the city protection array.

The huge array enveloped the entire GU city. No one could escape.

The sudden change made many people feel uneasy.

Guan Zhuang, who was buying equipment, could not help but frown.

At this moment, the soldiers of Gu City began to issue arrest warrants.

“Everyone, don’t worry. We are only following the orders of the Tianyun sect to look for a criminal.”

The city lord was extremely smart. He had purposely revealed the heavenly cloud sect to avoid offending someone he shouldn’t have.

Numerous wanted notices came from all directions.

Guan Zhuang, who was buying equipment, also saw the equipment posted in the weapons store.

He looked at the wanted notice in confusion. When he saw the person on the wanted notice, his expression changed drastically!

“Qin... Qin Yu!”Guan Zhuang’s eyes were as big as copper bells.

He never expected that the person wanted by the Heavenly Cloud sect was actually Qin Yu!

“Friend, may I ask, what did the person on the wanted poster do?”Guan Zhuang pulled a soldier from Gu City and asked.

The soldier glanced at Guan Zhuang and said, “I’m not sure. Rumor has it that he injured a guardian of the Heavenly Cloud Sect.”

“Injured a protector of the Tianyun sect?”This made Guan Zhuang even more shocked!

He knew that Qin Yu had offended the sect to escape, but he did not expect that he had offended the number one sect in the South Province, the Tianyun sect! And he had even injured their protector!

“Why? Have you seen him before?”The officer asked.

Guan Zhuang hurriedly shook his head and said, “No, I’m just curious.”

At this moment, Guan Zhuang also sensed that something was wrong.

Over the past few days, many people had seen him and Qin Yu walking together. If they did not leave now, something bad might happen.

Thinking of this, Guan Zhuang hurriedly bought equipment and walked out of the city in a hurry.

The exit was still heavily guarded.

Guan Zhuang walked over in fear, afraid that he would be stopped.

Fortunately, the officer only took Qin Yu’s portrait and compared it with him. Seeing that it was not Qin Yu, he let Guan Zhuang go.

The moment he exited the gate of Gu City, Guan Zhuang ran for his life! He was afraid that someone would catch up!

“Big Brother Guan!”

Just as Guan Zhuang was fleeing, Qin Yu jumped out of nowhere and grabbed Guan Zhuang.

At this moment, Guan Zhuang was like a startled bird, frightened by Qin Yu and staggered.

He wiped the sweat on his forehead and said anxiously, “Qin Yu, the people of the Heavenly Cloud sect are arresting you! The city Lord of Gu City has issued a warrant for your arrest!”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly and said in a low voice, “As expected, they are looking for me.”

“How did you offend the Heavenly Cloud Sect, Kid? Do you know who the Heavenly Cloud sect is?”Guan Zhuang couldn’t help but shout.

Qin Yu sighed and said, “I killed one of their disciples, beat up one of their elders, and even broke the body of a protector.”
