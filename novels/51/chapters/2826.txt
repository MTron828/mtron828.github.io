Qin Yu reached out and touched it. It was a liquid with a strong smell of blood.

Qin Yu wondered if it was the blood of those who volunteered to sacrifice to the heavens, but he felt that there seemed to be a warm feeling.

Countless monsters roared crazily. The blood rain was the purest form of energy to them.

However, this scene was like the end of the world to the human race.

When the heavens were standing at the alien race’s side, where could the human race go?

When the ritual was over, everything returned to silence.

Everyone fell into a deathly silence. Even Jiang Shengling, the strongest among them, was the same.

No one had the strength to stop what was happening here.

The location of the 30 ‘kings’ was the core region of the Eight Desolates Beast Domain.

Qin Yu felt a few kings’ internal qi were not inferior to Jiang Shengling’s after this evolution.

They might not even be able to repel these alien races, let alone that mysterious wormhole in the sky.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Boss Jiang, when do we plan to go back? There are many variables in this place under the influence of the wormhole. It’s best to leave as soon as possible.”

A thin old man in the crowd suddenly asked. This was not his destination in the first place, so he could not wait to go back now as so many things had happened.

“Not so fast. Although the ancient ship doesn’t need any energy, it needs time to recover. The spatial storm was too strong when we entered this area. We have to wait for at least a month before we can start it again.”

Leng Yuanxun shook his head.

“Gather here in a month. Before that, do whatever you want.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

After all the people left, he stood in front of Leng Yuanxun.

“That ancient ship was barely damaged. Even after entering the storm, it recovered in an instant. There’s nothing like what you said. Why did you lie?”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and asked.

“Although you haven’t awakened your peak power, your divine sense is terrifyingly powerful. Don’t worry. We might need to do something in this month. I was just afraid of arousing some people’s dissatisfaction, so I lied. It would be a little boring if the journey is too calm.”

Leng Yuanxun chuckled, but there was an inexplicable look on his face.

Qin Yu frowned and subconsciously looked at Jiang Shengling.

He seemed like didn’t hear the conversation between him and Leng Yuanxun. He was just reading a book seriously.

Occasionally, he would read out some sentences from the book.

“Hey, kid over there! I suggest you stay away from them, especially the fellow who is reading. He might kill us.”

A lazy voice sounded.

A guy wearing a wrinkled and loose robe appeared in front of the two of them. He seemed to have just woken up and his hair was still a little messy.

Behind him was a swordsman, Ling Xue.

Leng Yuanxun’s face turned ugly when he saw this man.

“Little Uncle, stop it.”

Ling Xue frowned. She knew her little uncle’s personality very well. Once he made such a remark, it would not be just a verbal statement.

“Liu Bai, Jiang Shengling just wants to test what is behind this passage. Four passages have been formed in the past thousand years, and the speed is increasing. If this continues, you know what it means.”

Leng Yuanxun’s face turned pale.

Sword Saint Liu Bai was the only one who could be called a Sword Saint in the Saint World.

Even Jiang Shengling would have to deal with him with all his might if he attacked.

“Jiang Shengling doesn’t look like he’s testing.”

Liu Bai’s face turned slightly ugly. The surrounding air suddenly became murderous.

Blood mist burst out of Leng Yuanxun’s body. Countless Spiritual Energy Sword wounds appeared on his body.

He took a deep breath. At this moment, he felt a bone-piercing cold.

The sharpness of his throat gave him goosebumps.

However, his pupils became sharp.

Leng Yuanxun took a step forward.

The terrifying sword intent in front of him disappeared completely and Liu Bai returned to his lazy appearance.

“Forget it. If the situation is not right, I can take my little nephew with me.”

“What a terrifying fellow! Just a thought from him almost caused me to die under this sword intent.”

Leng Yuanxun stared in the direction where Liu Bai had left and took a deep breath.

He gently sat on the ground and began to meditate.

“Try your best to leave this place. The storm is about to start.”

Ling Xue said with a complicated expression and left with Liu Bai.

“What kind of riddles are they talking about? Why can’t I understand? Is Jiang Shengling going to attack the Eight Desolates Beast Domain? If that’s the case, why didn’t he do it just now?”

Fatty Situ was also puzzled. However, Leng Yuanxun’s test this time was not simple from what they said. It might even put them in danger.

A dangerous thought flashed through Qin Yu’s mind. Could it be that Jiang Shengling and the others were going to attack the wormhole?

However, there were nearly 30 ‘kings’ there, not to mention that the wormhole was emitting such powerful and vast energy. It was not something that the two of them could fight against, was it?

Or did he want to attack the monster and demon races in the Eight Desolates Beast Domain? But hadn’t he already analyzed the pros and cons?

Qin Yu didn’t understand Jiang Shengling’s plan either.

“Forget it, Boss Qin Yu. No matter what this guy wants to do, I think it’s irrational for us to get involved in a battle of their level. Moreover, your divine soul is still in the Investiture of Gods.”

Fatty Situ whispered to Qin Yu.

“Sigh.”

Qin Yu nodded.

He couldn’t even use his full strength now, let alone his peak power.

Even if he wanted to do something, it was completely useless.

At this moment, the spatial storm that had been sealing off the Eight Desolates Beast Domain suddenly stopped spinning. The three ferocious forces in the void slowly dissipated. The storm also slowly calmed down.

In an instant, this powerful change in power attracted the attention of countless people.

Many people from the ancient ship also began to retreat to the outskirts of the Eight Desolates Beast Domain.

Now that there was no spatial storm, they could cross the void on their own.

Moreover, the unforeseen event that had occurred here made many people feel that it was dangerous. The blood rain of the Heaven Ritual fell.

Who knew how many peak power experts had been born here? Most of them would probably die here if the monsters wanted to hunt.

“Boss Qin Yu, what should we do now? If we want to leave this place, now is the best opportunity. However, we came here to find the power to resist the power of sealing gods.”

Fatty Situ looked a little conflicted.
