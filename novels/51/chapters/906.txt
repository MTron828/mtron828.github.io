Chapter 907: Chapter 907, Battle He Teng Again! 

At this moment, he teng looked at the two of them greedily.

Facing the famous Qin Yu and Jiang he, he teng did not panic at all!

“He Teng, are you here to court death?”Qin Yu took a step forward and said coldly.

He Teng licked his lips and said with a smile, “Qin Yu, all the Martial Saints in the world are looking for you. I didn’t expect you to hide in this place...”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “That’s why I can’t let you leave today.”

“Hahahaha!”

Hearing this, he teng could not help but burst into laughter.

His face was full of arrogance, and the strange internal Qi on his body kept surging.

“Today, I was ordered by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association to kill Jiang he, but I never thought that there would be unexpected gains,”he teng said with narrowed eyes.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

To Kill Jiang he?

Jiang he was famous, and everyone in the world knew of his reputation, but this he teng actually wanted to kill Jiang he?

At this moment, Jiang he took a step forward and said indifferently, “I knew that the Jingdu martial arts association would not give up, but I didn’t expect that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association would look down on me so much.”

He teng sneered, “You are looking down on me! Jiang he, don’t think that you are invincible just because you are the number one person in the world!”

“You must know that there are many ways to increase your strength! It is not just cultivation!”

“Is that so? Then let me experience it.”Jiang he slowly walked forward with an extremely calm expression.

“Senior Jiang He, leave it to me. I have an old grudge with this person,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Before Jiang he could answer, Qin Yu had already walked forward.

He looked at he teng coldly and said, “I’ve already let you escape many times. This time, I Won’t give you another chance.”

He Teng narrowed his eyes and said, “Qin Yu, I also want to experience your abilities.”

Qin Yu didn’t waste any words. He raised his hand and unleashed the absolute beginning Holy Fist!

This fist was wrapped in golden light and an invincible internal QI. It was like a full moon as it ruthlessly smashed toward He Teng’s face!

He Teng was not in a hurry. He stretched out a skinny palm from his black robe to meet Qin Yu!

“Boom!”

A huge explosion sounded between the two of them!

He Teng’s body retreated countless steps, and half of his arm was directly blasted through!

He fell to the ground, revealing his ghastly white bones under his black robe.

“As expected of a chaotic body. It is really beyond imagination...”he teng said with a sinister tone.

Qin Yu looked at he teng coldly and could not help but mock, “With this little ability, you dare to boast shamelessly?”

He Teng climbed up from the ground. His broken arm began to recover in the blink of an eye. His speed was far beyond imagination.

“If I only had this little ability, why would I come here alone...”he teng said sinisterly.

As he spoke, black qi burst out from his body.

This Black Qi was extremely difficult to deal with. It smelled like rotten eggs.

Qin Yu could not help but cover his nose and took a step back.

“This internal QI is poisonous. Be careful,”Jiang he reminded him from the side.

Qin Yu nodded and looked at he teng coldly. The aura of a half-step martial saint burst out instantly!

As long as he teng had not stepped into the martial saint stage, Qin Yu would not be afraid at all!

Under the cover of that mass of Black Qi, he Teng’s aura was also increasing strangely!

A mass of black qi was lingering around his every move!

In just a moment, he Teng’s strength had increased by a few points and he was almost approaching the martial Saint Stage!

Qin Yu could not help but be shocked when he sensed the aura from his internal Qi!

“What a powerful internal Qi.”Qin Yu frowned and said.

Jiang he said in a deep voice, “It’s the thing inside his body that’s causing trouble. This internal QI is already close to the martial saint stage.”

A trace of seriousness also appeared on Qin Yu’s face.

“Hehehe...”he teng’s mouth emitted waves of strange smiles.

His body was enveloped by the black qi and it was impossible to see his real body clearly. The balls of black qi spread in all directions and covered more than half of the mountain forest.

“Qin Yu, it’s time to end the grudge between us...”he teng let out a roar.

Qin Yu was about to speak when he suddenly felt his legs become extremely heavy as if they were filled with lead!

He did not dare to think too much and immediately lowered his head to look at his legs.

He saw that his legs were tightly wrapped by the black gas, and he could not move at all! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“What is this thing?”Qin Yu frowned slightly.

He was about to speak when he sensed a hint of danger!

“Be careful!”Jiang he’s concerned voice sounded in his ears!

Before Qin Yu could raise his head, a Big Black Hand smashed on Qin Yu’s face!

“Bang!”

The slap landed firmly on Qin Yu’s face. The fierce force was mixed with a poisonous gas, causing Qin Yu’s face to feel a burning pain

“Hehe... didn’t anyone tell you that you shouldn’t be distracted in a life-and-death battle?”He Teng’s strange voice seemed to come from all directions.

Qin Yu wiped his face, and his hands instantly turned red.

His face seemed to have been fractured, and the flesh and blood on his face seemed to have been shattered.

“What kind of strange move is this?”Qin Yu frowned.

He did not dare to be negligent. At that time, he released his spiritual sense to cover his surroundings.

“Boom!”

At this moment, another wave of killing intent came from Qin Yu’s back!

Qin Yu wanted to turn around to receive the attack, but his legs were firmly grabbed, and he could not move at all!

“Puchi!”

In an instant, it was as if thousands of sharp blades had pierced into Qin Yu’s back!

The tearing pain mixed with the burning pain caused Qin Yu to involuntarily let out a moan!

“Qin Yu, is that all you have...”

He Teng’s face appeared in front of Qin Yu.

Qin Yu stretched out his fist to smash at He Teng, but the Fist went straight through his face!

“What a strange move!”Qin Yu’s face could not help but change!

The most important thing at the moment was to get rid of this restraint as soon as possible, otherwise, Qin Yu would become a target to be hit!

Thinking of this, Qin Yu took a deep breath.

He adjusted his internal QI and pushed it to the limit!

A destructive power spread out from Qin Yu’s body!

This power gushed out like a volcanic eruption. For a moment, he teng and Jiang he were both shocked!

“You can’t break it,”he teng said coldly.

However, before he could finish his words, the black gas that was binding Qin Yu’s feet was immediately dispersed!

Balls of golden light that were like flames wrapped around Qin Yu.

Under this Golden Light, Qin Yu’s hair turned golden!

This was the first time he had unleashed all of his strength since he had stepped into the half-step martial saint realm.

Even Qin Yu himself was a little surprised by this powerful strength.

“Ever since I’ve stepped into the half-step martial saint realm, I really don’t know what kind of battle prowess I can unleash...”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

He looked at the face that had gathered in front of him and said coldly, “I’ll use you as an experiment today.”
