Chapter 633: Pavilion Master and Yan Shanhe Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

This auction was a way for the Jingdu Martial Arts Association to raise more funds. At the same time, it was also a symbol of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s strength to the outside world.

Thus, they absolutely wouldn’t let anything happen during the auction.

Sending out three black-gold robe powerhouses was enough to show how much they valued it.

Of course, the status of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association was extremely high. In all these years, no one had ever come to find trouble with the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

“The funds collected this time must reach at least ten billion,” Yan Guiyi said to the two black-gold robe powerhouses beside him.

The two people nodded and then said, “This has little to do with us. Our main duty is to maintain order at the venue.”

Yan Guiyi didn’t say anything. He swept his gaze across the venue and then retreated to the side.

Only the one-armed Yan Guiyi appeared a little strange.

Therefore, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association didn’t want Yan Guiyi to show his face in public because it was a disgrace to them.

This also filled Yan Guiyi with hatred toward Qin Yu.

Time flew by. At around eight o’clock in the morning, aristocratic families from all over the country rushed to the venue one after another.

These aristocratic families included both martial arts aristocratic families and ordinary wealthy individuals.

The entrance was already filled with luxurious cars.

Rolls Royces, Bentleys, and so on were countless.

They had one thing in common, which was that they had a large amount of cash on them.

However, at this moment, there was a black-robed person sitting in a car not far away. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

This person was none other than Qin Yu.

Qin Yu coldly looked at the entrance of the auction with a trace of viciousness flashing in his eyes.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly saw a familiar figure.

“Huh? The Pavilion Master is here too?”

A beautiful figure slowly walked out of the car.

There were two other people besides her, and one of them was Taozi.

With the help of the Pavilion Master, it was almost impossible to see any scars on Taozi’s face.

However, Taozi didn’t look happy. She looked extremely sad.

Qin Yu frowned and said in a low voice, “Could it be that the Pavilion Master wants something?”

Besides the Pavilion Master, Qin Yu saw many familiar figures.

People from the Han family, the Chu family, and even the Yan family came to participate.

Of course, the people who came to participate were naturally not the most powerful in the top aristocratic families.

“It seems that the prestige of this auction is much higher than I imagined.” Qin Yu frowned.

In other words... the impact of Qin Yu crashing the auction this time would probably be much greater than I imagined!

Qin Yu had no choice but to bite the bullet.

The auction was set at 10 am. At 9:30 am, almost everyone had arrived.

Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry to make a move. He sat in the car and waited quietly.

In the auction house, the Pavilion Master closed her eyes and waited quietly for the auction to begin.

“Ji Yuhong? I didn’t expect you to come too.”

At this moment, a voice sounded in the Pavilion Master’s ear.

He looked up and saw Yan Sihai’s brother, Yan Shanhe.

Yan Shanhe was on the same side as Yan Sihai. It was also because of this reason that Yan Shanhe had control over a certain amount of core businesses of the Yan family.

The Pavilion Master glanced at him but didn’t say anything.

Yan Shanhe sat beside the Pavilion Master and said with a smile, “Ji Yuhong, back then, you went against our Yan family for Qin Yu. What happened in the end?”

“Not only did you not get any benefits, but you even offended our Yan family!” Yan Shanhe said with an ice-cold expression.

The Pavilion Master glanced at Yan Shanhe and said indifferently, “So what if I offend your Yan Family? You want to boast to me?”

Yan Shanhe said with a cold smile, “The Yan family has no other ability but money! Ji Yuhong, you will slowly know the consequences of offending the Yan family.”

“Is that so?” The Pavilion Master snorted lightly.

“Yan Shanhe, I hope that the day you fall ill won’t come. Otherwise, you will also know the consequences of offending the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

When Yan Shanhe heard that, he couldn’t help but laugh out loud and said, “Do you think that you can control all the medical resources in the country? Hahaha, what a joke!”

“By the same logic, do you think that your Yan family can control the entire country?”

Yan Shanhe smiled nonchalantly and said, “I won’t argue with you, but I am afraid that you won’t be able to get what you want today, heh heh.”

After saying that, Yan Shanhe walked to the side.

After he had left, Taozi couldn’t help but ask, “Lord Pavilion Master, who is this person?”

The Pavilion Master said, “Yan Shanhe, who is known to be the Yan family’s business elite. The Yan family’s economic lifeline is now in his hands.”

Taozi frowned and said, “What about Yan Sihai? Isn’t he the head of the Yan Family?”

The Pavilion Master nodded and said, “Speaking of which, the Yan family is really a wondrous family. The four brothers each have their own strengths.”

“Yan Sihai is ruthless, while Yan Shanhe is proficient in business. Yan Tianhong has an extremely strong network of connections, and Yan Yongxiu... has a trace of humanity.”

Taozi was deep in thought. She asked in puzzlement, “What about Yan Yunheng?”

“Yan Yunheng has all of their strengths, which is also the magical part of the Yan family,” said the Pavilion Master.

Taozi nodded without fully understanding. A moment later, she said in a low voice, “In any case, every good aspect.”

As she spoke, the host walked to the stage.

Then, the door slowly closed.

From backstage, several white-robed martial artists walked out.

They stood on both sides of the corridor.

And in the dark, there were three black-gold robe powerhouses led by Yan Guiyi.

They released their divine senses and covered the entire venue. If anything unexpected happened, they would act quickly.

On the stage, a host walked up.

He smiled nonchalantly and said, “The annual auction of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association begins now!”

“This time, we have prepared a total of thirty items for everyone!”

Thirty items. This was almost the largest number of items the Jingdu Martial Arts Association had produced in recent years!

Not only that, but this time, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association had invested a lot of money and brought out many treasures!

There was only one reason for this. It was because the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s higher-ups realized that their higher-ups were dissatisfied with them, so they had to perform well.

“I must get the rainbow-colored glaze this time,” the Pavilion Master thought to herself.

The auction soon began, with all kinds of treasures appearing one after another.

There were ordinary antiques, calligraphy, and paintings, as well as martial artists’ magical artifacts and herbs.

“The next item for auction is rainbow-colored glaze!” Soon, the host took out a rainbow-colored glaze cup.

Seeing this glaze cup, the Pavilion Master’s eyes immediately lit up.

“The rainbow-colored glaze is a treasure that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association obtained from abroad. It is said that this item has an indescribable magical effect on medicine refinement. With rainbow-colored glaze, one can achieve twice the result with half the effort,” the host said with a nonchalant smile.

“The starting price is 80 million!”

Very quickly, someone in the venue called out the price. In just a short ten minutes, this rainbow-colored glaze had been raised to more than 300 million.

“It’s about time to make a move,” the Pavilion Master said.

She raised her hand and said, “Five hundred million.”

As soon as she said this, everyone immediately turned to look at the Pavilion Master.

“So it’s the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.” Upon seeing the Pavilion Master’s face, everyone immediately had the intention to retreat.

“The Pavilion Master deserves this item the most,” someone said.

“Eight hundred million!”

However, a discordant voice was heard.

Yan Shanhe looked at the Pavilion Master with a nonchalant smile.
