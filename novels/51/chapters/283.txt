Gu Taichu smiled nonchalantly. “You want to know?”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He just stared at Gu Taichu.

Gu Taichu said slowly, “If you defeat me, naturally I’ll tell you.”

“Then don’t waste time!” Qin Yu said coldly.

As soon as he finished speaking, Qin Yu’s internal qi suddenly burst out!

Qin Yu really wanted to know the identity of the “he” that Gu Taichu was talking about!

This was because Qin Yu had a strong feeling that this might be able to let him find out about his father and his own background!

After sensing this internal qi, the smile on Gu Taichu’s face became even wider.

“How impressive to be able to unleash such an internal qi at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Stage!” Gu Taichu’s face was full of admiration!

However, he wasn’t in a hurry to make a move. Instead, he raised his hand and waved it lightly.

The reporters who were filming in the dark immediately fainted.

In the entire courtyard, only Qin Yu and Gu Taichu were left!

“Make your move,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Gu Taichu immediately suppressed his own strength to the peak of the Foundation Establishment Stage. Then, he looked at Qin Yu.

“Come!” As soon as he finished speaking, Gu Taichu took the lead to charge towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu didn’t show any weakness and immediately clenched his fist to confront him!

This was a purely physical confrontation! Although Gu Taichu suppressed his strength to the peak of the Foundation Establishment Stage, his physical body was still that of a level five Inner Strength Grandmaster!

When the two fists collided, Qin Yu retreated three steps, and his wrist was so shaken that it hurt.

As for Gu Taichu, he retreated dozens of steps, and his palm was even shattered!

“What a strong body!” Gu Taichu was a little surprised.

Qin Yu said coldly, “You’re not my physical match.”

Gu Taichu sighed, “Despite the large difference in realms, your body is more powerful than mine. It’s really shocking.”

With that, Gu Taichu’s expression became serious.

He lifted his feet up lightly, then a ray of light came from below him and wrapped around Gu Taichu like armor!

This process was extremely fast. In the blink of an eye, Gu Taichu had already put on armor!

“What is this?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown while looking a little surprised.

Gu Taichu said indifferently, “A spell.”

After he said that, Gu Taichu’s body floated into the air!

Then, Gu Taichu waved his hand, and the light on his body immediately rose like needles!

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

This light was extremely fine, almost comparable to a person’s pores! It was also extremely fast, and was practically a rain of needles!

Qin Yu tried to use his physical body to resist it, but he discovered that this light had directly pierced his body!

“Pu!”

In a short moment, Qin Yu felt as if his internal organs had received an impact!

Not only that, but even his internal qi had begun to become chaotic, and it was difficult to control it!

“What a magical spell.” Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

He took a deep breath and forced himself to calm down. Then, he raised his head to look at Gu Taichu.

At this moment, Gu Taichu’s second wave of attacks came at Qin Yu!

“Swish Swish Swish!”

This time, the number of needles was even larger, and they almost covered the entire courtyard!

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. He wanted to dodge, but he found that there was nowhere to hide!

“If we fight with spells, I’m not his match at all,” Qin Yu muttered softly.

Since fighting with spells didn’t work, he could only rely on his physical body to fight!

Thus, Qin Yu immediately shouted and forcefully endured the spells. He clenched his fist and charged at Gu Taichu!

However, what shocked Qin Yu was that Gu Taichu didn’t intend to fight with him with his physical body at all!

He dodged to the side at an extremely fast speed and used the spells to attack Qin Yu once again!

Qin Yu chased after him relentlessly, but no matter what, he couldn’t touch Gu Taichu!

In a short moment, Qin Yu’s body had already been hit by hundreds of needles!

And his internal qi had already been disrupted to the point that he was almost unable to control it!

“If this continues, I’ll definitely lose.” Qin Yu’s forehead dripped with a trace of sweat.

“In the end, you’re still not my match,” Gu Taichu said indifferently.

As soon as he finished speaking, the third round of attacks came towards Qin Yu!

“Pu, Pu, Pu!”

This time, Qin Yu’s dodging slowed down a lot!

Countless rays of light pierced into Qin Yu’s body!

Qin Yu’s eyes dimmed somewhat, and his body swayed. He was on the verge of collapse.

In a short moment, Qin Yu crashed onto the ground and was unable to get up.

In mid-air, the corners of Gu Taichu’s mouth curled up into a smile.

He put his hands behind his back and said slowly, “Although your body is tough, your weakness is obvious.”

After saying that, Gu Taichu descended from the sky and walked toward Qin Yu.

He looked at Qin Yu, who was on the ground, and said in a low voice, “If I wanted to kill you now, you would be dead.”

“Is that so?”

However, at this moment, Qin Yu, who had fainted, suddenly opened his eyes!

“Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist!”

Qin Yu’s fist had been wrapped in gold at some point in time!

The scorching and bright fist instantly arrived in front of Gu Taichu!

Gu Taichu’s expression immediately changed! At such a close distance, it was difficult for him to dodge no matter how fast he was!

“Absolute beginning... Sacred Fist!” Gu Taichu suddenly shouted the same name!

His fist was also dyed with a golden light!

The two fists collided, and gusts of wind spread out in all directions!

The courtyard, which was already riddled with holes, was even more dilapidated now!

Boom!

Gu Taichu’s physical strength was still slightly inferior. His body was instantly enveloped by the light on his fist, and his physical body was sent flying!

Qin Yu panted heavily. He forced himself to calm down his chaotic internal qi and looked at Gu Taichu nervously.

As the light descended, Gu Taichu’s body was covered in blood, and his physical body was on the verge of shattering!

Qin Yu clenched his fist and charged towards Gu Taichu once again! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

At this critical moment, Gu Taichu removed the suppression of his strength and quickly recovered to his peak!

“Bang!”

Gu Taichu, a rank five Inner Strength Grandmaster, easily received Qin Yu’s punch.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel annoyed. “You’re cheating!”

Gu Taichu forced a smile. “If I continue to suppress my strength, I’m afraid I’ll die from this punch today.”

After saying this, Gu Taichu released his fist and slowly said, “You pretended to collapse to the ground to entice me to get closer and then waited for an opportunity to make your move.”

“That’s right. Your combat experience is beyond my imagination.”

Qin Yu didn’t have time to listen to him. He asked anxiously, “I won, didn’t I?”

“You won.” Gu Taichu nodded slightly.

Qin Yu hurriedly said, “Okay. According to the agreement, you must answer my question!”

Gu Taichu stroked his beard and smiled. “You can ask.”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Why do you know about the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist?”

The Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist was the inheritance left behind by his father, and Gu Taichu actually performed the same move!

This surprised Qin Yu!

Gu Taichu glanced at Qin Yu and smiled. “This was passed down to me by your father. Even my name was given to me by your father.”

Qin Yu’s pupils dilated when he heard this!
