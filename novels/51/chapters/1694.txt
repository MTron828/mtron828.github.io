Qin Yu’s voice immediately attracted everyone’s attention.

The young man’s expression turned even colder.

He looked at Qin Yu and said coldly, “It’s You Again?”

Qin Yu ignored the young man. He looked at the host and said, “I have something in my hand too. I want to take it out and try it out.”

“You? What can you have? How dare you snatch an unknown thing from me?”The young man coldly berated.

The host on the stage smiled and said, “Okay, please take out your replacement item.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath. After thinking for a while, he took out a small bottle from the spatial magic artifact.

This bottle wasn’t big. It was only the size of a palm, but it was filled with red blood.

A wave of corpse qi rushed at him, followed by a strong sense of oppression!

“What is this thing?”

For a moment, the thing in Qin Yu’s hand attracted the attention of countless people. Even the young man frowned.

He asked the old man beside him, “What is the thing in his hand?”

The old man bowed slightly and said, “I’m afraid it’s Saint Blood?”

“Holy Blood? This kid actually has holy blood?”The young man appeared somewhat surprised.

The host on the stage also asked, “What is this thing?”

Qin Yu held the bottle with one hand and then said in a deep voice, “This is dragon blood.”

“Dragon Blood? What Dragon Blood?”

“The Blood of the demonic beast of the Green Rock Forest?”

“Qin Yu seems to have stayed in the green rock forest for a period of time. It doesn’t seem strange that he could get the blood of such a demonic beast.”

“But… The Blood of this demonic beast doesn’t seem to be worth taking out, right?”

In the face of everyone’s doubts, Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “This is the blood of the Divine Dragon, taken from the Dragon Burial Cave.”

As soon as these words were said, everyone’s eyes instantly widened!

Even that young man suddenly looked at Qin Yu!

“Dragon Burial Cave? This is the blood of the Divine Dragon from the Dragon Burial Cave?”The young man stared at the bottle in Qin Yu’s hand! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

There were too many rumors about the dragon burial cave. It was a place where even a saint would die if he entered!

Rumor has it that the dragon burial cave was filled with ancient divine dragons. It was extremely terrifying!

“Impossible!”The young man said coldly.

“Even we can’t leave the dragon burial cave unscathed, let alone you! If you went to the Dragon Burial Cave, How Could You Come Out Alive!”

Qin Yu’s expression didn’t change as he said, “This is indeed obtained from the dragon burial cave. As for how I came out, I don’t think I have to tell you.”

“Hahahahahaha! You really don’t know how to Brag!”The youth mocked.

“Do you know what the Divine Dragon Blood Means? A drop of its blood can kill you! It’s not something a person like you can touch!”

Qin Yu did not say anything. He opened the bottle in his hand and an extremely sacred internal Qi gushed out.

Under this internal QI, everyone felt as if they had seen a god. Some even knelt down on the spot!

After sensing this internal QI, the expression of the old man beside the young man changed slightly.

“Young master, this is probably the true divine dragon’s blood,”the old man took a deep breath and said in a low voice.

The young man gritted his teeth and said, “How could he have the Divine Dragon Blood!”

“Young master, you don’t have to be anxious. This is a good thing for us. It’s an unexpected gain,”the old man reminded him faintly.

The young man narrowed his eyes slightly, as if he understood the old man’s meaning.

He sneered and said, “What you said makes sense. This kid actually has such a supreme treasure on him. Interesting…”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He knew very well that once the divine dragon blood was taken out, it would definitely bring him trouble!

However, Qin Yu did want to obtain the divine tea token, so he could only take this risk now.

“Any drop of dragon blood can bring you great improvement. However, for ordinary people, this divine dragon blood can not be taken directly. It can only be used to refine medicine,”Qin Yu continued.

Then, he looked at the bottle in his hand and said, “If you use it, this small bottle of divine dragon blood can easily allow you to step into the reversion void stage, or even the higher true Saint Stage.”

As soon as he said this, everyone’s eyes widened!

This small bottle of blood could actually allow people to directly step into the reversion void stage or even the true Saint Stage? This was too inconceivable!

“What he said is true. I’ve heard of the rumor has it that many true sages wanted to enter the dragon burial cave to obtain the Divine Dragon’s blood, but they all died in the end.”

“If he really has the Divine Dragon’s blood in his hands, then it’s a true supreme treasure.”

“How could this Qin Yu have such an item in his hands? How did he obtain it?”

On the stage, the owner of the token was also slightly excited.

Nothing could compare to his own strength and realm.

If he could really step into the return to void realm or even the true saint realm, then not to mention the small southern region, he could even walk unhindered in the entire holy region!

“How do you prove that the blood in your hands is Divine Dragon Blood?”At this time, the host asked.

Qin Yu held the bottle, shook his head and said, “I don’t know how to prove it. I can only tell you that what I said is true. As for whether you believe it or not, I have no choice.”

Speaking up to this point, Qin Yu glanced at the young man not far away, he said indifferently, “Just like how do you prove that the dream glaze in his hand is real? If he trades a fake for the token in your hand, what can you do?”

“Compared to an arrogant and despotic person who I’ve never met before, I think you should trust me more.”

A few words instantly made that young man furious!

Just as Qin Yu said, the dream glass in his hand was indeed a fake! But it could also be considered the best of the fakes!

Now that it was exposed by Qin Yu in public, how could he not be angry in his heart!

“Kid, you’d better not talk nonsense,”the young man said coldly.

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered with him at all. He knew clearly in his heart that after experiencing this matter, he had already offended him, so there was no need to give him any face.

“How you decide is up to you,”Qin Yu said.

After saying this, he sat down.

The owner of the token on the stage seemed to be a little conflicted.

A moment later, he suddenly said, “Qin Yu, you’ve made great contributions to the South Province and saved us many times. I’m willing to believe that what you said is true!”

Qin Yu immediately heaved a sigh of relief when he heard that.

He smiled and said, “Don’t worry, what I said is true. If you’re willing, I can use dragon blood to refine medicine for you.”

That master was immediately delighted and hurriedly said, “Thank you, Young Master Qin!”

The host at the side smiled and said, “Is there anyone else who wants to offer other treasures?”

The scene was silent, but that young man’s expression was incomparably cold.

At this moment, a voice sounded in Qin Yu’s mind.

“Kid, have you considered the consequences of snatching things from me?”The young man said coldly.
