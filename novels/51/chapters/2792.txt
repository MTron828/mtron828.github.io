Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

A gentle breeze blew almost simultaneously when Long Brow was sent flying.

This wind carried the smell of soil as if it were the smell of the sky before a storm.

“Why is there wind?”

An ominous feeling enveloped everyone’s hearts.

The power of the Investiture of Gods had destroyed this space. The wind couldn’t blow here.

But this was indeed happening at this moment.

The long-browed elderly man retreated behind the head of the Alester family, Sir Ming. The two of them looked in the same direction.

A petite figure appeared beside the Investiture of Gods, but the strange thing was that she was carrying a huge tombstone. “God Slayer Zi Yan!”

Qin Yu was shocked. He had seen this person before.

Zi Yan had gone to the Demon Sealing Valley’s Treasure Pavilion to obtain the artifact spirit of Ten Directions Annihilation.

At that time, she did not kill Qin Yu. Qin Yu had a deep impression of this person. Could she be here to obtain the Investiture of Gods too?

The moment Zi Yan appeared, Qin Yu also felt very surprised.

His previous realm was also unable to understand Zi Yan’s exact strength. “Ten Directions Annihilation! This is exciting!”

Ming stared at the tombstone that had been lifted. A solemn expression flashed across his face.

He seemed to be quite afraid of this item.

At this moment, the huge lightning flashed in the entire void. It seemed to have become transparent.

Hundreds of overlapping spaces near the void suddenly appeared here.

The scenes were beautiful and the smoke was curling up.

In an instant, it had changed into a human country. Many people were searching for food and clothing.

In the next moment, it was another sanctum for immortals to cultivate. Many cultivators were cultivating desperately.

The scenes surrounded everyone.

However, Qin Yu couldn’t touch it when he reached his hands out.

The scenes that flashed before his eyes were like an illusion, making him unable to figure it out.

“These are the scenes of hundreds of spaces not far from here. They must have been affected by the power of the Ten Directions Annihilation. The scenes have been refracted here.”

Lance looked at Zi Yan with a hint of fear.

“Young Lord, step back. She’s going to use Ten Directions Annihilation!”

“Okay!”

Fatty Situ controlled the talisman of the divine picture of the Luo River to envelop everyone without hesitation and then floated backward.

All the refracted spaces seemed to be swallowed by an invisible force simultaneously.

Everything in space, whether it was mountains, rivers, forests, cities, villages, or people, disappeared without a trace.

The sky had lost its usual blue color and turned pitch-black. The stars fell and the Sun and the moon lost their light. The earth cracked, volcanoes erupted, floods raged, and gales roared.

The air was filled with a thick smell of sulfur and dust, making it suffocating. The once bustling world was now dead silent. All lives, regardless of their strength, were completely wiped out at this moment.

No creature could escape this disaster.

The entire world seemed to have returned to the beginning of chaos. All order and rules were broken. Time and space lost their meaning at this moment, leaving only endless nothingness and darkness.

Ten Directions Annihilation!

The space collapsed. The boundless terrifying power crushed the tens of thousands of meters of space where the Investiture of Gods was.

A furious consciousness flashed past. The Creepy here seemed to have heard some command.

Almost everyone heard the crisp sound of an egg breaking.

That terrifying power finally hit the main body of the Investiture of Gods.

A strange light flashed. It seemed to contain some kind of consciousness.

They crazily charged towards everyone. Everyone, including Zi Yan, suffered from those strange and crazy attacks.

A smoking pipe was lit in front of Zi Yan like a sword from hell.

Zi Yan tapped her foot, but the pipe followed closely in front.

The two of them seemed motionless on the spot, but they had already crossed an unknown distance in the blink of an eye. Smoker Xie’s expression turned strange.

Boom!

Zi Yan seized the moment when she passed by Smoker Xie and threw a punch at him.

In an instant, his body turned into minced meat.

However, a consciousness passed through the minced meat in the blink of an eye.

The body reformed again and countless tentacles attacked Zi Yan like sharp swords.

The Creepy who had lived here for a long time could fight evenly with the God Slayer, Zi Yan.

“Investiture of Gods, you can’t escape your fate no matter how you struggle today.”

Ming Alester walked slowly. His golden hair stood out.

He was like an elegant noble, strolling on the fields of his hometown.

Although he was in the void space, Qin Yu’s enormous divine sense could not capture his figure.

At this moment, Ming Alester’s consciousness was locked onto the Investiture of Gods like countless chains. He and the tablet crossed thousands of spaces in the blink of an eye.

Boom!

In an instant, a golden fist fell like a meteor.

It accurately hit the Investiture of Gods. The tablet burst out with a ferocious howl.

The entire space collapsed. Ming Alester retracted his fist and followed behind the Investiture of Gods steadily as if he had done something insignificant. “What a terrifying power! Is he the strongest person in this world?”

Qin Yu felt his heart tremble with fear. Ming used the strength of his physical body to shatter the entire space.

This kind of power would probably cause even the Holy Lord to retreat.

A ghost bride in red suddenly appeared behind Alester.

“Wifey, kill him.”

“Alright.”

A strange expression appeared on her face and the corners of her mouth slowly parted.

A fair hand gently grabbed Ming Alester’s golden hair.

The one who attacked was none other than the first and second-ranked Creepy.

The two Creepy were able to catch up to Ming Alester.

Whoosh!

Time froze and the sword light flashed.

The long-browed old man struck out with his sword again. This sword slashed through countless spaces again, wanting to support the family head.

However, the power of this sword gradually disappeared after passing through thousands of spaces. It could not track their footsteps at all.

“Are you still not going to attack? If everyone still wants to watch the show, I’m afraid I’ll have to retreat.”Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

It was as if Ming Alester did not notice the two Creepy behind him.

As his sleeves fluttered slightly, a star-like fist landed again.

Roar!

The Creepy behind him turned into countless tentacles and swallowed his body at the same time.

The next moment, their heads suddenly fell.

An old Daoist walked down slowly from the top of the Nine Nether Cliff.

He tossed two heads in his hands as if he was playing with some toy.

The number one kulapati, Bai Zizai..
