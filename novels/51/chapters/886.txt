Chapter 887: Chapter 887, heavenly phenomenon 

The internal Qi on Qin Yu’s body became more and more terrifying. This internal Qi had even alarmed everyone!

Intentionally provoking Qin Yu had become the most regretful thing in Gu Xinghe’s life.

Qin Yu’s body flashed explosively. In the blink of an eye, he had arrived beside Gu Xinghe.

His speed was ridiculously fast. Even a half-step martial saint could not see him clearly!

In the next second, Qin Yu pressed Gu Xinghe’s head on the ground and slid forward quickly!

“You’re F * cking courting death!”Qin Yu’s furious roar was like the roar of a wild beast as it spread throughout the entire manor!

He grabbed Gu Xinghe’s head with one hand, and in the blink of an eye, he had slashed dozens of meters away!

Meanwhile, Gu Xinghe’s head had left a long trail on the ground, and countless pieces of gravel had turned into powder!

Gu Xinghe tried to struggle, but he found that he could not break free at all.

The strength of Qin Yu’s palm was extremely terrifying, almost tearing his head apart!

“Boom!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

At this moment, Qin Yu grabbed Gu Xinghe and smashed his fist on Gu Xinghe’s lower abdomen!

Gu Xinghe’s figure instantly flew high into the air. Before he could react, Qin Yu had already appeared behind him!

Qin Yu clenched his fists and smashed fiercely onto Gu Xinghe’s back!

In an instant, Gu Xinghe’s back bent in a strange arc! His body crashed straight into the ground!

“Go to hell!”

Qin Yu roared repeatedly, the light in his hands continuously shining.

The golden light was like a bomb, continuously smashing towards Gu Xinghe!

In just a few short moments, the ground had turned into a huge pit!

“If this continues, I’m afraid Gu Xinghe will die here!”Wan Gu Qiong exclaimed in shock.

The few half-step martial saints present looked at each other and rushed towards Qin Yu in unison.

They tried to stop Qin Yu, but they were sent flying by a single punch!

Even several half-step martial saints were unable to stop Qin Yu!

“Boom!”

As Qin Yu’s punch smashed down, a crack appeared on the ground.

The crack spread rapidly, directly splitting the entire manor into two!

“Ruoxue, hurry up and stop him, or else... he will really kill him,”Yao Meng could not help but whisper.

Yan Ruoxue also did not expect Qin Yu to explode with such astonishing strength. She stood up and looked in Qin Yu’s direction, saying in a low voice, “Qin Yu, stop.”

Hearing Yan Ruoxue’s voice, Qin Yu seemed to have regained some of his rationality.

His hand that was grabbing Gu Xinghe’s head also stopped.

At this moment, Gu Xinghe was being held in his hand like a dead dog.

This was the second time this young master from the second mystery realm had been beaten up violently.

Qin Yu threw Gu Xinghe aside and then swept his gaze towards Wan Guqiong and the others, saying coldly, “I will remember all of you. I will not let any of you off.”

Wan Gu Qiong could not help but tense up when he heard this, and his back turned cold.

Meanwhile, the half-step martial saint who was hiding in the dark and planning to make a move also had the intention to retreat at this moment.

“No, this kid is like a mad dog. If he makes a move, I’m afraid he will die here.”

“Retreat, he is no longer someone a half-step martial saint can deal with.”

The several half-step martial saints who were hiding in the dark immediately left this place.

Wan Gu Qiong and the others did not dare to stay any longer. They grabbed Gu Xinghe and left this place with their tails between their legs.

Qin Yu’s gaze swept the surroundings. No one dared to look at him wherever he passed.

“Phew.”

Qin Yu let out a long breath and slowly walked to Yan Ruoxue’s side and sat down.

“I didn’t scare you, did I?”Qin Yu said with some embarrassment.

Yan ruoxue blinked her eyes and said, “What do you think?”

This made Qin Yu a little embarrassed. He hurriedly explained, “Actually, I’m not usually like this. It’s just that...”

At this moment, Yan Ruoxue reached out a finger and covered Qin Yu’s mouth.

“Don’t explain, and don’t need to explain. I know what you’ve done for me,”Yan Ruoxue said softly.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but lose his mind. After a moment, he gently pulled Yan Ruoxue into his arms.

After such a matter had occurred, many people had left the banquet.

Those who remained were basically the few disciples of the aristocratic families in Jingdu.

“Brother Qin, I have to remind you that if the martial saint were to be born, it would not be good news for you.”At the banquet, Zhuang Teng could not help but say.

“That’s right. The martial saint’s birth is already a foregone conclusion. As far as I know, it might be brought forward or delayed.”Chu Heng added.

Qin Yu nodded silently. He took a deep breath and said, “I know. Thank you for your concern.”

After the meal, Qin Yu brought Yan Ruoxue away.

On the way, Qin Yu looked at Yan Ruoxue and said apologetically, “Ruoxue, I’m afraid our plan has to be changed for the time being.”

Initially, Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue had planned to look for old Mister Yan. However, from the looks of it, they did not have much time left.

“Wherever you go, I’ll go.”Yan Ruoxue leaned on Qin Yu’s shoulder and said softly.

Qin Yu said in a low voice, “These days won’t last long. I’ll give you a peaceful life.”

The next day.

Qin Yu brought Yan Ruoxue and rushed to the Green Moon Villa.

They arrived near the Green Moon Villa’s spirit spring. Li Yu was still rubbing the secret key.

“How is it? How much longer?”Qin Yu asked.

Li Yu stretched out a finger and said, “About a day or so.”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Can the secret key of this mystic realm be modified?”

Li Yu stopped what he was doing and shook his head. “At least I can’t do it.”

This made Qin Yu feel a little awkward.

He was worried that this mystic realm would be discovered. At that time, it would be troublesome.

With the ability of the JINGDU martial arts association, it would not be difficult for them to find a secret realm master.

“I can only take it one step at a time. I must try to enter the martial saint realm before they discover it.”Qin Yu thought to himself.

As long as he entered the Martial Saint Realm, Qin Yu would no longer need to be afraid.

At this moment, Li Yu’s gaze fell on Yan Ruoxue.

“You Are... Yan Ruoxue?”Li Yu sized up Yan Ruoxue and asked.

Yan ruoxue nodded and said, “Hello.”

Li Yu rubbed his chin and said, “I’ve long heard that Miss Yan is the number one beauty in Jingdu. Now that I’ve seen you today, you really live up to your reputation. Speaking of which, you were the one I longed for when I was young.”

Yan ruoxue slightly bowed and said humbly, “Mr. Li, you flatter me.”

“Alright, let’s not waste any more time. Let’s find the secret key as soon as possible,”Qin Yu said from the side.

Li Yu did not say anything more and continued to search for the secret key.

Time passed by minute by minute, and in the blink of an eye, it was already night time.

At night, the sky was quiet and peaceful. From time to time, there were insects and birds chirping.

Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue lay on the ground and looked up at the sky, looking very happy.

“Look, there seems to be a shooting star!”At this time, Yan Ruoxue pointed at the sky and said with some excitement.

“Make a wish quickly!”Yan Ruoxue urged.

She put her hands together and closed her eyes slightly.

Qin Yu also quickly imitated Yan Ruoxue’s movements and made his own wish.

A moment later, Qin Yu looked at Yan Ruoxue and said, “What wish did you make?”

“If I don’t tell you, it won’t work!”Yan Ruoxue said playfully.

Qin Yu opened his mouth. Just as he was about to speak, a large auspicious cloud phenomenon suddenly appeared in the sky!

Seeing this phenomenon, Qin Yu’s expression suddenly changed!
