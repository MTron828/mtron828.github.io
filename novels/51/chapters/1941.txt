1942 I’ll Give You a Chance

“This guy is fast!” Qin Yu was shocked!

He had just arrived at the temple and didn’t expect Si Shiyue to come to him immediately!

It seemed that the Si family was very concerned about this matter!

“Si Shifeng, we meet again.” Qin Yu was calm. He pretended he did know Si Shiyue by the side.

“That’s right,” Yi Shifeng sneered and said. “I didn’t attack you the last time because of Saintess Gu. You’re not so lucky this time.”

Qin Yu was just about to speak when Si Shiyue by the side said coldly, “You’re Qin Yu?”

“Who are you?” Qin Yu said pretentiously.

Without waiting for Si Shiyue to speak, Si Shifeng shouted, “Are you blind? This is my Si family’s Holy Son, Si Shiyue!”

“You’re Si Shiyue?” Qin Yu asked in surprise. “As expected of the Si family’s Holy Son, you have an extraordinary demeanor, unlike the clown who talks nonsense.”

These words were clearly directed at Si Shifeng, whose expression instantly turned cold.

“Are you courting death?” Si Shifeng stepped forward, looking like he intended to attack.

“What?” Qin Yu said, grinning. “You admitted it?”

“Sharp-tongued little b*stard! If I don’t teach you a lesson, you don’t seem to know much about the world!” Si Shifeng shouted, and his body exuded a strong killing intent!

At this moment, many people in the surroundings had gathered around. They stared at the scene in front of them with anticipation on their faces.

Everyone seemed to want to know how Si Shiyue planned to face Qin Yu.

“Si Shiyue probably won’t attack Qin Yu. After all, the difference in their cultivation is too big.”

“That’s not necessarily true. If he doesn’t make a move, wouldn’t it be very annoying to the Si family when everyone comes to extort them in the future?”

Si Shiyue looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “This doesn’t seem to be the first time we met.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly, pretended to be surprised, and said, “Don’t tell me we’ve met before?”

“That ugly person by Ruoxue’s side not long ago was you, right?” Si Shiyue said coldly.

Upon hearing this, Qin Yu was instantly stirred up in his heart!

This Si Shiyue indeed lived up to his reputation. His divine sense was so sharp!

Qin Yu had already concealed his internal qi at that time. He didn’t expect this Si Shiyue to be able to detect him!

Coming to this point, Qin Yu surely would not admit it. He sneered and said, “What ugly person? What are you talking? I don’t understand what you’re saying.”

Si Shiyue knew that Qin Yu wouldn’t admit to it, so he didn’t dwell on this issue. Instead, he asked, “Did you and Yan Ruoxue come from the same place?”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said with his hands behind his back, “That’s right. It seems that the Holy Son of the Si family knows me well,”

“Know you well? Who do you think you are? Are worthy for our Holy Son to know you?” Si Shifeng shouted.

Qin Yu directly chose to ignore Si Shifeng’s clamor.

He looked at Si Shiyue and did not take Si Shifeng seriously at all.

That feeling was like he and Si Shiyue were on the same level, while Si Shifeng only played a minor role.

This made Si Shifeng even more unhappy. He stepped forward and was about to speak when Si Shiyue beat him to it and said, “You, too, have a chaotic body?”

“That’s right.” Qin Yu nodded.

“Yan Ruoxue is mine,” Si Shiyue said coldly. “Everyone in the world knows that. Don’t you know?”

“Hehe, you’re talking nonsense. When did Yan Ruoxue become yours?” Qin Yu sneered.

Si Shiyue squinted his eyes, saying, “As a man, don’t you feel embarrassed for doing such a shameless thing?”

“Shameless? Why? You can like Yan Ruoxue, but I can’t?” Qin Yu didn’t take it seriously.

He grinned and said, “You and I both have chaotic bodies. It’s just that you’ve cultivated earlier and longer than me. Given time, it’s still not known who will become stronger.”

Si Shiyue’s expression was extremely cold. His body quietly exuded a powerful sense of oppression.

This sense of oppression came straight to Qin Yu. In just a moment, Qin Yu felt as if he was carrying a mountain on his shoulders, feeling extremely painful!

He stayed calm, but in fact, he was resisting with all his might.

“Crack!”

Soon, the ground underneath Qin Yu’s feet crumbled under such a powerful sense of oppression. The cracks spread out densely in all directions like a spider web!

Qin Yu was full of panic in his heart. This Si Shiyue’s strength was probably even more terrifying than he had imagined!

The chaotic body indeed lived up to its reputation!

With the two having the same physique, Qin Yu’s cultivation would definitely be a drawback!

Just as Qin Yu was about to give up, the sense of oppression from Si Shiyue’s body disappeared.

He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “We both have chaotic bodies. I’d like to see what you’re capable of.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

This was obviously a trap, and Qin Yu would not fall for it.

He grinned and said, “I also want to know your strength. It’s a pity that my cultivation realm is too low. How about you give me some time?”

“Oh?” Si Shiyue’s brows rose, and he was instantly interested.

“What? Are you challenging me for a battle?” Some hints of disbelief were in Si Shiyue’s eyes.

Qin Yu nodded, smiled, and said, “That’s what I meant. I don’t know if you’re willing to do it. Of course, I have nothing to say if you send someone to kill me or attack me now. After all, the Si family has many powerful cultivators.

Si Shiyue opened his mouth and was about to speak when Qin Yu beat him to it and continued, “I understand you. After all, you’ve always thought you’re the most powerful chaotic body. It’ll be a disgrace if you lose to me in the future.”

“You? You’re overestimating yourself,” Si Shiyue said with a dark face.

...

Like a rascal, Qin Yu spread his hands and said, “Just tell me if you dare. If you don’t, then forget it. I still want to go to the temple fair.”

“Qin Yu, do you think you’re worthy of fighting with our Holy Son? Why don’t I fight with you? We can settle our scores, old and new, in one go,” Si Shifeng said indifferently as he stepped forward.

“You? I’m fighting with your Holy Son. Who do you think you are? Are you the Si family’s Holy Son? Or do you have a chaotic body?” Qin Yu laughed and said.

Si Shifeng’s face darkened. He glared at Qin Yu and said, “Kid, if you don’t dare, just say it!”

Si Shiyue, by the side, also said indifferently, “It’s too degrading for a nobody like you to fight me. If you can defeat Si Shifeng, I might consider it.”

Qin Yu knew he would have to fight Si Shifeng sooner or later, so he sighed.

He looked at Si Shifeng and said, “Sigh! Then I’ll reluctantly agree to your request. I’ll give you a chance to have glory…”

“You!” Xi Shifeng was so angry that he almost vomited blood. Qin Yu was clearly at the bottom level, but now the situation seemed to be reversed.
