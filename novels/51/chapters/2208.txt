2209 The Daffodil Girl

Yun Fengqing’s sword strike did not even pierce through the Demonic Beast’s skin.

The Demonic Beast swung its mouth, and its enormous tail emitted a crisp sound like a whip, smashing Yun Fengqing’s body with a thud.

Yun Fengqing was sent flying by the Demonic Beast, fell onto the ground, and fainted.

After that, the Demonic Beast opened its blood-red mouth and bit Yun Qingyun.

Qin Yu leaped and stopped before the Demonic Beast.

Then he kicked out, and the giant crocodile’s enormous head was directly kicked hundreds of feet away by him.

“Mr. Qin saved our lives again, but we should leave quickly. I’m afraid the smell of blood will attract many more Demonic Beasts.”

Uncle Qun said worriedly.

“Tell me about this place.”

Qin Yu said with a frown.

Xing Xiu’s strike had severely injured his spiritual sense.

At this moment, he urgently needed to heal his injuries. Otherwise, if he encountered a top-notch martial artist of the Advanced-stage of True Saint, he might not even be able to defend himself.

“In purgatory, people, demons, and beings of the demonic race all exist. It has become a lawless land. Those who can survive here are all powerful and ruthless people. The spiritual energy here is thin, and they can only replenish their spiritual energy by hunting Demonic Beast or the human race’s golden cores.”

Uncle Qun said with a bitter smile.

“If not because Hei Yun wanted to attack us, I wouldn’t have come here.”

“The purgatory has ten levels from the top to the bottom. I heard the lowest level has the most powerful Demonic Beasts and human-demonic cultivators. Even dragons have died there. Moreover, the space there is strange. I heard the space below is linked to the green bamboo forest, the Holy Region, and the devil’s den.”

Yun Qingyun stuck out her tongue and said.

Qin Yu was also a little shocked when he heard this. This purgatory seemed to be much more complicated than what he had seen.

He suddenly thought of Brother Crane and wondered if he would be destined to meet Immortal Crane here.

“Hey, Grandpa. There are so many people here.”

A childish voice sounded from behind Qin Yu.

Qin Yu was quick-witted. Although his spiritual sense was damaged now, someone who could sneak up behind him silently was probably not an ordinary person.

“Eh, is this a daffodil?”

Qin Yu turned around and saw a beautiful and refined little girl. She was clearly a daffodil that had transformed.

“Be careful. Demonic Beast that can take human form is at least Reversion Void Stage. The elderly man beside this little girl is probably at the Peak of True Saint. My Yun family has a magical artifact that specializes in detecting the strength of Demonic Beast, but we can’t detect the strength of this elderly man at all.”

Uncle Qun said worriedly. Holding the most powerful magical artifact in his hand, he dared not relax at all.

In this purgatory, it was normal to attack at any time.

Hmm?

The elderly man’s face turned cold, and Uncle Qun’s magical artifact shining on the elderly man’s body suddenly exploded.

“Big Brother, you seem to be severely injured.”

The little girl stared at Qin Yu and asked curiously.

“Xiaoru, don’t talk to human cultivators. They aren’t good people.”

The elderly man frowned.

“Alright, alright. I know, Grandpa Wilted Vine.” The little girl stuck out her tongue and looked very cute.

Then the elderly man brought the little girl to sit on a swan and left directly.

“Big brother, this is for you. It will help with your injuries.”

A petal suddenly fell into Qin Yu’s hand.

He looked up and saw the little girl’s mischievous eyes.

“Xiaoru, you!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Wilted Vine noticed Xiaoru’s movements and his expression changed.

“You can’t get angry. It’ll make you grow old.”

Xiaoru grabbed Wilted Vine’s white beard.

“Okay, okay, okay. Grandpa is not angry. You can’t grab Grandpa’s beard.”

As the two voices gradually faded, Uncle Qun Bo’s tense body finally relaxed.

“It’s a thousand times harder for plants to gain sentience when compared to ordinary Demonic Beast. Since he dares to swagger in purgatory like this, this old man must be at least at the Peak of True Saint.”

Uncle Qun said, breaking out in cold sweat.

“Moreover, Demonic Beasts are much more powerful than human cultivators. That demonic crocodile just now was only at the Reversion Void Stage, but it could defeat Yun Qingzi, who has reached the True Saint.”

Uncle Qun said again.

The group returned to the ship and continued moving forward.

“Then where are we going now?”

Qin Yu asked with a frown.

“To Solitary Cloud City. It’s the only orderly city in purgatory. People of different races can go there. Many people go to Solitary Cloud City to form teams or replenish their strength before they go to the lower level to hunt for Demonic Beast. There’s also a formation that teleports to the Heavenly Cloud Continent.”

Uncle Qun explained to Qin Yu patiently.

Qin Yu nodded. He opened his palm, and a daffodil leaf instantly appeared in his hand.

A surge of pure energy caused Qin Yu’s pores to open slightly, and the intense pain from the tearing of his divine sense seemed to have reduced a little.

This leaf was even more precious than the ten-thousand-year-old medicinal herbs!

Qin Yu was a little puzzled at this moment. He did not know why the little girl would give him one of her leaves.

He still needed a few different herbs to refine a Spirit Gathering Pill.

An ordinary Spirit Gathering Pill would probably have no effect on Qin Yu now. However, coupled with this leaf, it should be of great help to Qin Yu’s divine sense injuries.

Qin Yu put away the daffodil’s leaf and entered the space of his divine sense with a thought.

At this moment, the golden light of the figurine in his divine sense had disappeared. The figurine was dispirited to the extreme.

A terrifying scar was left by the dagger on the golden figurine from the top of its head to its body.

The divine sense of the Tribulation Transcending Stage was so terrifying. Even if it was only a wisp of divine sense, coupled with the way, it could severely injure him.

Golden blood seeped out from the figurine’s head. Every breath seemed to bring Qin Yu pain like his soul was torn apart.

And the most terrifying thing was Qin Yu discovered the connection between his divine sense and his body was gradually weakening.

The divine sense was the soul of the body. Now that his soul was severely injured, his body was naturally affected as well.

“This is troublesome. I have to gather the herbs as soon as possible. Otherwise, I would be in great danger if I encounter a True Saint who has comprehended the way.”

Qin Yu’s expression was tremendously ugly.

…..

It was in Solitary Cloud City in purgatory.

As soon as Qin Yu entered the city, he noticed all sorts of fierce internal qi.

There were demon races with terrifying demonic qi, demonic cultivators with bloody bodies, and a tower-like cultivator with a human head belt on his waist.

There were even dozens of Reversion Void Stage cultivators who had their hands chopped off and were carrying demon races of gigantic size.

Everyone turned a blind eye to it as if they were used to it.

In purgatory, strength reigned supreme. If the human race could hunt the demon race, the demon race could naturally hunt the human race as well.

Uncle Qun shook his head.

Yun Qingyun had never seen such a bloody scene before, and her face was ashen.

“Uncle Qun, let’s quickly head to the teleportation formation and go back.”

There was an enormous square in the center of Solitary Cloud City.

It was densely packed with people, and various voices resounded one after another.

“Form a team and head to the first level to hunt Demonic Beast! We lack a True Saint Realm cultivator.”

“To go to the third level of the Mystic Realm requires a Master of Path of Heaven. We’ll equally split the treasures obtained.”

“We need a large number of Demonic Beasts and cultivators’ inner cores. We can trade for the treasures displayed at the stalls.”
