2017 Suppress and Kill!

Looking at the black and white longswords in the hands of the elder of the Chu family, Qin Yu soon recognized the origin of these two longswords.

“It seems you know about the Yin Yang Sword,” the elder holding the black sword said coldly.

The white sword elder continued, “Although this sword isn’t the real Yin Yang Sword, its power isn’t inferior. It’s good enough to kill you.”

“Taking out this sword means you will completely vanish from this world.”

!!

The two echoed each other, and the discouraged look earlier on had been swept away and replaced with indescribable confidence.

There were many legends about the Yin Yang Sword. According to the legends, the Yin Yang Sword was a mysterious double sword forged by the two major sects of Yin and Yang, representing the power of the two extremes of Yin and Yang.

Not only did the Yin Yang Sword have limitless power, but it also had tremendous mysterious power. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“It’s a pity you don’t have the real Yin Yang Sword. It’s just a replica.” Qin Yu sneered.

The black sword elder shouted immediately, “Even if it’s a replica, its power is not something you can imagine. We’ll kill you like killing an ant!”

“With the Yin Yang Sword, we and a Semi-Saint can be evenly matched, let alone a mere middle stage of Reversion Void like you!” the white sword elder shouted angrily.

Qin Yu raised her eyebrows slightly.

Evenly matched with a Semi-Saint? It might be exaggerated to say so, but he had to admit the terrifying power of these two swords.

“Let’s not talk about whether you can fight a Semi-Saint. Even if it’s true, I’m not afraid!” Qin Yu shouted loudly, and his internal qi instantly erupted to the extreme!

He didn’t want to waste time with these two people, so he immediately activated the Star Seal!

The dao technique of heaven and earth immediately gathered in Qin Yu’s hand, condensing the outline of a planet in his palm!

And the incredibly terrifying pressure was even more overwhelming!

Even though the two elders held the Yin Yang Sword, a hint of shock flashed across their faces!

“I want these two swords. After I kill you, they will be mine!” Qin Yu held the Star Seal in his hand, and his internal qi had already erupted to the extreme!

The golden light was like lightning, emitting a sizzling sound. The surrounding void was distorting non-stop!

“What a terrifying internal qi!” the black sword elder exclaimed.

The white sword elder was silent. He had never expected this ordinary-looking young man to have such terrifying strength!

If he had known this would happen, he wouldn’t have risked his life to come and snatch this bullsh*t magical artifact!

“Since we have come to this point, there’s no way out. Let’s kill him!” The black sword elder saw through the white sword elder’s thoughts. He roared angrily and immediately began to activate his black sword!

The terrifying black path inscription continuously interweaved, and a strange power surged!

The white sword elder did not lose out. He immediately activated his white sword, and rays of white holy light also emitted!

In the end, the two path inscriptions began to fuse, forming the incredibly terrifying power of heaven and earth!

Qin Yu was taken aback as if feeling a little surprised.

However, he wasn’t afraid. Under the Star Seal, even a Semi-Saint wouldn’t dare to take it head-on, let alone two Reversion Void Stage cultivators!

“Buzz!”

At this moment, Qin Yu activated the fifth level of the fighting word formula, and her internal qi erupted again!

It was Qin Yu’s state of complete victory. It was enough to show Qin Yu’s determination to kill the two of them at this moment!

“Go to hell!”

Qin Yu roared furiously. The Star Seal instantly covered the sky and earth, crushing toward the two of them!

It was the third time Qin Yu activated the Star Seal. Its power had once again erupted, and even the patterns on the star had taken shape!

Although the two elders were frightened, they had no way out. They could only activate the power of the two swords to attack Qin Yu!

“Boom!”

The two forces soon collided, and the Star Seal was temporarily blocked!

The surrounding void continued to collapse, and the two forces continued to fight!

The black and white elder used all their might to activate the two swords. Their faces were covered in sweat, and blood began to flow from all over their bodies!

However, the Star Seal was simply too terrifying. It was a technique that had been passed down from the Guardian, a technique that the Guardian had created by observing the starry sky. How could two mere elders resist it?

In the end, they could no longer resist the Star Seal. The terrifying power of the star continued to change and crushed the two of them!

“Boom!”

Finally, the white sword elder, who had already lost his will to fight, was the first to give in. The white sword in his hand was sent flying, and his body was knocked back a few steps before finally falling onto the ground!

Without the balance of the white sword, the black sword elder was naturally even more miserable. He was counterattacked by the power and exploded to death on the spot!

Everything in the surroundings instantly turned into dust as if a sandstorm had been triggered. It lasted for some time before it gradually calmed down.

A breeze blew over, and Qin Yu walked over step by step.

On the ground, the white sword elder kept vomiting blood, and his internal qi was extremely weak.

He stretched out his hand and wanted to say something, but he could not say it.

Qin Yu stretched out his palm, and the black and white swords instantly landed in his hands.

He tried to swing the two swords, and a strange power immediately spread out.

“They are indeed two good swords. It’s a pity that they were wasted in your hands.” Qin Yu shook his head.

The so-called Yin Yang Sword should have been wielded by a man and a woman to unleash its true power. Unfortunately, it fell into their hands.

Qin Yu walked up to Elder Bai. He bent down and said, “So, the real Yin Yang Sword should be in your Chu family?”

Elder Bai opened his mouth and wanted to speak, but he could not say a thing.

...

Qin Yu sighed and could not help but mutter, “F*ck, I was too harsh. I’m afraid I can’t get anything out of him now.”

Before Qin Yu could stand up, Elder Bai had completely stopped breathing.

Without delay, Qin Yu searched Elder Bai’s body and found three magical artifacts.

Although these three magical artifacts were not top-notch, they were still excellent for activating formation.

“This is an unexpected gain,” Qin Yu thought to himself. “If I have a chance in the future, I’ll probably have to make a trip to the Chu family.”

Since they could take out a replica and only took out the Yin Yang Sword at the critical moment, the Chu family might have the real Yin Yang Sword!

Qin Yu did not know much about the Chu family. But he guessed it was not a great aristocratic family. Otherwise, they would not kill and rob people for ten billion spirit coins.

After packing up, Qin Yu returned to Divine Fortuity City.

Although this battle was not considered a great battle, the Star Seal and the fighting word formula still consumed a lot of Qin Yu’s energy. When he returned to his accommodation, he had become extremely weak.

“When I gather enough magical artifacts, I can activate the Endless Killing Formation.” Qin Yu took a deep breath, and a trace of viciousness flashed in his eyes.

If he could kill Elder Si, not only could he protect Xiao Hai, but he could also avenge Wen Da.
