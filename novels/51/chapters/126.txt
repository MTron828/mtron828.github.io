Chapter 127: Shattered With a Single Punch! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

With such strength, there was no need for him to return to South City.

This was because no matter where Inner Strength Past Master went, he would be highly sought after.

He would either be supported by a prominent aristocratic family, or be a small leader in an overseas faction, or he would reign over an area.

This made Lu Shuming feel extremely hopeless. He looked at Qin Yu with a pleading look in his eyes.

“If you can help me get through this crisis, I’m willing to give you 20% of the shares of the Lu Family’s business!” Lu Shuming said through gritted teeth.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Really?”

“Absolutely!” Lu Shuming said anxiously.

Compared to his life, money was nothing!

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Okay, I promise you.”

The scar-faced man not far away couldn’t help but snort coldly and said, “You’re really foolish. You know that I’m Inner Strength Past Master, yet you still dare to challenge me?”

Qin Yu laughed. “There’s nothing I can do. Mr. Lu is offering too much money. It’s really hard to refuse.”

“Moreover... I also really want to see the capabilities of an Inner Strength Past Master,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

“Alright, since that’s the case, then don’t blame me for being merciless!” The scar-faced man roared angrily, and his body actually instantly lit up with rays of light!

These rays of light firmly wrapped the scar-faced man within. Compared to Liu Shihui, his tactics were much more impressive!

Qin Yu snorted coldly. He took a step forward and charged towards the scar-faced man!

“Bang!”

Qin Yu’s fist landed firmly on the scar-faced man’s body!

However, what was shocking was that the scar-faced man didn’t seem in pain at all!

“Hahaha!” The scar-faced man raised his head and laughed loudly.

“With your mediocre abilities, you actually dare to speak so arrogantly?” The scar-faced man said coldly.

Qin Yu lowered his head and looked at his own fist. He muttered in a low voice, “An Inner Strength Past Master is quite extraordinary... but you’re just so-so.”

Qin Yu wasn’t impressed by a so-called Inner Strength Past Master.

After all, Qin Yu had even fought with a great Inner Strength Past Master like Yan Jiang before.

And Qin Yu was just testing him out with that punch just now.

“Make your move. Otherwise, I’m afraid you won’t have a chance,” Qin Yu said.

The scar-faced man sneered. “You’re the most arrogant person I have ever seen. Although I just became Inner Strength Past Master not long ago, the gap between Inner Strength Master Hands and Inner Strength Past Master is like a chasm! It’s definitely not something you can surpass!”

Qin Yu frowned. “You babble too much.”

The scar-faced man immediately shouted angrily, “You’re courting death!”

After saying that, the scar-faced man instantly rushed towards Qin Yu!

His fist lit up with white light, as if all his Inner Strength was gathered at this point!

When they saw this punch, everyone’s expression changed drastically!

Wu Hongchang, who was lying on the ground, even closed his eyes and shifted his body for fear that he would be implicated.

However, Qin Yu didn’t dodge. Instead, he clenched his fist and faced it head-on!

“Clang!”

A sound that sounded like steel colliding sounded in everyone’s ears!

With this punch, the scar-faced man actually took three steps back!

On the other hand, Qin Yu was as calm as ever.

“That’s it?” Qin Yu sneered.

The scar-faced man’s expression gradually became serious.

He clenched his fist and said coldly, “What a strong force. I’m getting more and more interested in it.”

“You’ve disappointed me a little.” Qin Yu shook his head.

The scar-faced man didn’t mind his remark. He said coldly, “I’ll give you a choice. If you’re willing, I can let you join us. Moreover, your position won’t be low. At the same time, you’ll get a huge sum of money.”

As soon as he finished speaking, everyone’s expression changed again! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

This scar-faced man was actually trying to recruit Qin Yu!

“Apart from that, we’ll also provide you with various resources, herbs, top-grade pills, and even inherited cultivation techniques.” The scar-faced man continued to entice him.

“You should know that all these things are all rare and sacred.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “Your conditions are indeed very tempting.”

The scar-faced man was delighted and quickly struck while the iron was hot. “How about it? Joining us gives you a much better future than staying in South City!”

“Mr. Qin...” Lu Shuming, who wasn’t far away, suddenly became nervous.

If Qin Yu agreed, then Lu Shuming would definitely be doomed today!

“May I ask, did you bring any treasures with you today?” Qin Yu asked.

The scar-faced man was even more excited. He laughed loudly and said, “You’re indeed quite quick-witted. I have a hundred-year-old herb here. As long as you’re willing to join us, I can give it to you as a welcome gift.”

“A hundred-year-old herb? It seems that your organization is very rich.” Qin Yu sighed.

The scar-faced man said with some pride, “Of course. As long as you’re willing to join us, this is nothing.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. The atmosphere became a little awkward.

Lu Shuming stared at Qin Yu. He was so nervous that he was sweating profusely.

“How about it?” the scar-faced man continued to ask.

Qin Yu sighed. “Your offer is indeed very tempting, but... unfortunately, I have never been interested in overseas organizations, and I don’t want to live like a fugitive like you, so I have to refuse.”

Hearing this, Lu Shuming immediately let out a sigh of relief.

The scar-faced man was extremely angry!

He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “You’re foolishly unappreciative! If you refuse me, you will be offending our entire organization!”

“Do you think I will be afraid?” Qin Yu sneered.

This completely infuriated the scar-faced man. He shouted angrily, “Do you think you can beat me? Since you’re so unappreciative, then don’t blame me for being merciless!”

After saying that, the scar-faced man charged at Qin Yu again!

His speed was extremely fast, but Qin Yu was faster than him!

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu had already punched him more than ten times! And the scar-faced man didn’t even get to touch Qin Yu!

“Your speed is really fast.” The scar-faced man squinted his eyes and said.

“Unfortunately, you can’t hurt me at all! My body is wrapped by Inner Strength, and I can even resist ordinary bullets!”

“You can’t even hurt me, so how can you beat me?” The scar-faced man raised his head and laughed crazily!

But very soon, his laughter stopped abruptly! His expression was full of fear!

“Who said I can’t hurt you? Do you really think that your Inner Strength can protect you from death?” Qin Yu’s voice sounded in the scar-faced man’s ear.

Qin Yu punched the scar-faced man’s chest!

“Crack!”

The Inner Strength wrapped around the scar-faced man’s body emitted a crisp sound!

In the next second, it shattered like an eggshell!

“This... how is this possible? How is this possible?!” The scar-faced man’s pupils dilated, and his face was filled with terror!

Qin Yu sneered. “Don’t be too full of yourself. Can’t you just hide overseas?”

After saying that, Qin Yu threw another punch!

This punch shattered the scar-faced man’s chest!

His entire chest caved in and his bones completely shattered!

“Boom!”

The scar-faced man fell to the ground and fresh blood covered his face.

“This... how is this possible...” the scar-faced man muttered in a low voice. Even until his death, he still couldn’t figure out why Qin Yu’s fist had such great strength.
