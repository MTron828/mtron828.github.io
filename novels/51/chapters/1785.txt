1786 An Endless Improvement?

The two looked at each other, smiled, and said, “It’s not reslistic to bring a Saint Weapon here. If we were to give you a Saint Weapon, we could directly make a move to eliminate Xiao Sheng from this world.”

Yao Yingxuan seemed to have expected this to happen. Thus he wasn’t too surprised. He just nodded and said, “Then please find another expert.”

“Stop.”

At this moment, the two called out to Yao Yingxuan.

They looked at Yao Yingxuan coldly and said, “If you disagree, you’ll be offending our Tong family. When we come with the Saint Weapon, we’ll wipe you out too!”

Yao Yingxuan frowned slightly. He pretended to be frightened and sat down again.

“I’ve already said that without the Saint Weapon, I’m no match for Xiao Sheng,” Yao Yingxuan said.

“Don’t be nervous. Since we ask you to help, we’ll naturally help you secretly,” the two men said with a faint smile.

“Asking you to take action is just for show. When the time comes, our men will take the opportunity to eliminate Xiao Sheng. This way, the credit for killing Xiao Sheng will be yours. In the future, your God Bless Sect will definitely have a bright future in Lizhou,” the two smiled and said.

At this moment, Yao Yingxuan seemed to have understood the Tong family’s intention.

They didn’t make a move themselves because they wanted to support a puppet in Lizhou who would work for their Tong family in the future.

“To be honest, Sect Master Yao, you have to agree today no matter what,” the two said indifferently.

It was obvious that this time the two were more confident than before.

“I want to know why you want to attack Xiao Sheng,” Yao Yingxuan said after some thought.

“You don’t have to know this.” The two shook their heads.

“What?” Yao Yingxuan’s face darkened. “I’m working for you, but I don’t even have the right to know the truth?”

The two men looked at each other, and seemed to think it made sense. Thus they nodded and said, “Alright. There’s no harm in telling you.”

“Someone from Nanzhou snatched our young master’s belongings. In order to protect this person, Xiao Sheng did not hesitate to go against the Tong family.

“Our young master had initially given him a chance, but he didn’t appreciate it. How can we let him go?”

Upon hearing this, Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically.

Sure enough, these people were sent by the young man previously!

“The Tong family…” Qin Yu murmured, and a cold look flashed across his face.

Next door, the two continued, “Don’t worry. When we make our move, we’ll kill Xiao Sheng as quick as lightning. Our people will bring the Saint Weapon.”

“Alright then. What do I get in return?” asked Yao Yingxuan in a deep voice.

“Benefits? Of course, we will help you to unify Lizhou after this,” the two said.

“But except Thunder Courtyard,” they then added and said.

Yao Yingxuan took a deep breath and said, “Alright, I’ll agree with you. I’ll issue a challenge letter to Tianyun Sect in a few days.”

“Good! A wise man submits to circumstances. Sect Master Yao, I believe we will have a pleasant cooperation,” the two said with a smile.

In the room next door, Qin Yu’s desire attacked him again.

Qin Yu looked at Jue Wu, who was eating and drinking, and said, “Can you kill the two of them?”

Jue Wu was stunned. She wiped her hands and said, “Of course, no problem! I’m going to slaughter them now!”

“No need to rush.” Qin Yu stopped Jue Wu.

“It’s not the time to act yet. We’ll act after they’ve gone far.”

Part of the reason he wanted to attack them was that they were from the Tong family.

More importantly, Qin Yu wanted to devour their primordial spirits!

Both of them were at the Reversion Void Stage. If he devoured their primordial spirits, he would definitely be able to restore his primordial spirit completely!

Of course, most of all, it was because soon Qin Yu no longer could restrain this impulse anymore.

The two got up and left the restaurant. Qin Yu and Jue Wu quickly followed.

They concealed their internal qi and quietly followed the two in the crowd.

“If you’re not their match, run away, understand?” Qin Yu warned.

“I can crush them like crushing two ants!” Jue Wu shook her hands and said.

Of course, most of all, it was because soon Qin Yu could no longer restrain this impulse.

Both of them followed the two, and soon they walked out of the East Continent.

At this time, it was rather quiet and deserted in the surrounding. Thus it was the right time to make a move.

“Jue Wu, these two people are from the aristocratic families of Zhongzhou. If you kill them, the Tong family will know. You will then get into trouble. So you must think carefully,” Qin Yu said softly.

Jue Wu rubbed her small hands and said, “Don’t talk nonsense. I don’t care from which family they came. I’ll just kill them.”

Without giving Qin Yu a chance to speak, Jue Wu whooshed over and blocked their way.

Seeing Jue Wu in front of them, the two couldn’t help but raise their eyebrows.

“Small kid, why are you blocking us?” the two asked.

“Uncle, I’m lost. Can you take me there?” Jue Wu said with a smile.

When the two heard this, they couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“Let’s go, Uncle will take you to a nice place.” The two weren’t on guard at all as at this moment, Jue Wu looked like a harmless little girl.

Therefore, Jue Wu walked up to them with a playful look on her face.

Just as the two were about to speak, Jue Wu suddenly stretched out her small hand and slapped the head of one of them!

The power of this slap was incomparably terrifying. With a slap, his head was instantly crushed!

The other person’s expression changed drastically when he saw this. He quickly stretched out his hand and wanted to suppress Jue Wu.

However, with his strength, how could he defeat Jue Wu?

No matter how many top-notch spells he used, they were still not enough to deal with Jue Wu.

In a short while, the two were whipped to death by Jue Wu.

Qin Yu, who was hiding in the dark, could not hold it in anymore.

He was like a wild beast whose eyes were red from hunger. He pounced forward and rudely devoured the primordial spirits of the two!

After devouring their primordial spirits, the impulse and excitement in Qin Yu’s heart greatly reduced.

This thing seemed to be addictive, like poison.

Qin Yu let out a breath of satisfaction, and his red eyes gradually returned to normal.

“What?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly noticed something was wrong.

After devouring their primordial spirits, Qin Yu’s damaged primordial spirit did not only restore completely, but its power also increased tremendously!

His primordial spirit seemed to have improved, and the little golden man in his mind seemed to have become tougher!

“Could it be… There’s no upper limit to this Meridian Circulation Technique?” Qin Yu opened his mouth in shock.

The cultivation of the primordial spirit was much tougher than the cultivation of the cultivation realm!

And the power of the primordial spirit was often even more terrifying!

At this moment, Qin Yu was at a loss. He didn’t know if it was a blessing or a curse.
