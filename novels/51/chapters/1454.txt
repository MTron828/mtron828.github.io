Chapter 1455: Chapter 1,455, challenging the Tianyun sect

“It’s the northern lands again.”Xiao Hai frowned.

“If it weren’t for you, the northern lands would have attacked us long ago!”The tight-fitting clothes said furiously.

“However, it’s useless for you to stop us. Soon, we will be connected to each other. At that time, no matter how capable you are, you can forget about stopping us!”

Xiao Hai looked at the two of them coldly and said, “Can’t You Live Your Own Life? Why do you have to eat the Southern Region?”

“Hahahaha! Cut the crap! Our northern land and the southern region can not live under the same sky!”The tight-fitting clothes shouted crazily.

“Do you think that it’s useful for you to stop us? Our northern land has already joined forces with the western ridge to besiege the southern region! It’s useless even if you stop us.”

“Why don’t you join us? With your ability, you will definitely be valued in our northern lands, and we will even let you be the number one person below the northern lands Lord! How about it?”

Xiao Hai looked coldly at the two of them and said, “As long as I, Xiao Hai, am still alive, we will not be able to start a war.”

After saying that, he waved his hand and directly crushed the two of them.

After getting rid of the two of them, Xiao Hai looked at Qin Yu and cupped his hands, saying, “Qin Yu, thank you very much.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Senior Xiao Hai, why has the northern lands always had designs on the southern region?”

Xiao hai sighed and said, “I don’t know either. In recent years, the northern lands have been acting frequently. I’ve always suspected that someone from our Southern Region has formed an alliance with them, but I can’t find any evidence.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Someone has formed an alliance with the northern lands? Senior Xiao Hai, who do you suspect?”Qin Yu asked in puzzlement.

Xiao Hai shook his head and didn’t say anything else.

“Senior Xiao Hai, if the northern lands and the southern region really start a war, what difference does it make to you? With your abilities, you can go to other regions, even the central region,”Qin Yu said in puzzlement.

Xiao Hai glanced at Qin Yu and said, “I was born in the southern region and grew up in the southern region. How can I bear to see the Southern Region turn into a Wasteland?”

“Furthermore, the northern region is an extremely cold region. Their natures are ferocious and they don’t care about civilization and morals. They expand without order to the outside world, burning, killing, and plundering. Once they step into the southern region, it will definitely cause a bloody storm.”

Qin Yu originally wanted to retort, but he changed his mind. If someone wanted to slaughter their way into Earth on a large scale, Qin Yu wouldn’t agree either.

This might be the feeling of belonging to his hometown. Thinking of this, Qin Yu nodded to Xiao Hai and said, “Senior Xiao Hai, I understand.”

“Where are you going?”Xiao Hai changed the topic.

Qin Yu’s gaze turned cold as she said coldly, “I’m going to the Heavenly Cloud sect. They killed my friends. I must make them pay the price.”

Speaking of this, Qin Yu changed her mind and asked, “Senior Xiao Hai, you won’t interfere in this matter, right?”

Xiao Hai laughed loudly and said, “I’ve never interfered in the competition between sects.”

“That’s good,”Qin Yu agreed.

After two encounters, Qin Yu had a general understanding of Xiao Hai.

He would never interfere in any fights within the southern region. Once it involved other regions, he would definitely not sit idly by.

After Xiao Hai greeted Qin Yu, he quickly left the place.

Qin Yu did not feel much about the war between the several continents.

After all, he hadn’t been in the South Province for a long time, and he didn’t belong here.

Another Day passed.

Qin Yu finally arrived at the Heavenly Cloud sect.

The huge divine hawk streaked across the sky above the Heavenly Cloud sect, attracting the attention of countless people.

At this time, the first elder had already woken up, and more than half of his injuries had recovered. However, he was still some distance away from the peak.

“Whose divine hawk is that? How dare it pass over the sky above our Heavenly Cloud Sect?”

“Who is so bold as to be tired of living?”

The first elder also raised his head to look at the godly eagle, and a person quickly appeared in his mind. It was Zhuo Jing.

“Could it be... Qin Yu? !”The first Elder’s face changed, and he quickly thought of Qin Yu!

Before he could recover from his shock, a loud shout came from outside.

“First Elder, come out and face your death!”

The loud voice contained powerful spiritual power, shaking the entire heavenly cloud sect and making a buzzing sound!

The people around the heavenly cloud sect were also attracted by Qin Yu’s loud shout.

Especially boss Zheng of an Fenglou. When he heard the voice, he hurriedly ran out.

“Qin... Qin Yu!”

When he saw Qin Yu at the entrance of the Heavenly Cloud sect, boss Zheng’s expression immediately changed!

“Quick, close the door, close the door quickly!”Boss Zheng said in extreme fear.

But at that moment, a figure rushed out from the anfeng building anxiously.

That person was none other than Ding Yi.

“Ding Yi, come back quickly!”Boss Zheng shouted anxiously.

How could Ding Yi listen to him? She ran in the direction of the Heavenly Cloud sect with all her might.

“Damn it, close the door!”Boss Zheng couldn’t care less. He was afraid that Qin Yu would come and find trouble with him.

When the door was closed, there were people watching from the dark.

Qin Yu looked at the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s door coldly and shouted angrily, “First elder, come out and face your death!”

The loud voice made the fragments of the heavenly cloud sect’s visitors fly everywhere. It seemed that they couldn’t bear it anymore.

“Qin Yu!”

At this moment, Ding Yi’s voice came from the crowd.

She ran towards Qin Yu while shouting Qin Yu’s name.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but look at Ding Yi, and his brows instantly furrowed slightly.

Following that, he raised his palm, and a huge force instantly made Ding Yi unable to move.
