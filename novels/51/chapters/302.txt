A Breakthrough Pill laid quietly in Qin Yu’s palm.

One of Qin Yu’s palms had already been burnt black, and it was a ghastly sight to behold. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“This is the Breakthrough Pill?” Everyone looked at the pill in Qin Yu’s palm with some doubt.

Qin Yu nodded and handed the pill to the stall owner.

The stall owner held the Breakthrough Pill with some curiosity on his face.

He had never seen the Breakthrough Pill before, so he didn’t know whether this pill was real or fake.

“Speaking of which, apothecary, is this Breakthrough Pill real?” The stall owner looked at the apothecary from the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

The apothecary’s expression was extremely unsightly, and he couldn’t help but clench his fists.

He knew very clearly that this pill was the Breakthrough Pill!

But if he admitted it, then he wouldn’t be able to obtain this Purple Gold Gauze Cloth!

The apothecary glanced at the surrounding crowd and saw that everyone was waiting for his answer.

Hence, he cleared his throat and said, “This isn’t a Breakthrough Pill at all. Don’t be deceived by him.”

The moment these words were said, everyone present was shocked!

Qin Yu’s brows were tightly knitted as he looked coldly at the apothecary.

“If this isn’t the Breakthrough Pill, then what is it?” Qin Yu questioned coldly.

The apothecary snorted lightly and said, “If my guess is correct, this is a useless pill. In other words, your pill refinement has failed.”

“What nonsense are you spouting?!” Qin Yu berated coldly.

“Whether this is the Breakthrough Pill or not, you know very clearly! As an apothecary of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, you are spouting nonsense for your own selfish interests and taking advantage of others’ trust in you!”

“Is this how the Divine Alchemist Pavilion is? Looks like you guys are just so-so!”

After he finished speaking, everyone immediately gasped!

Qin Yu actually belittled the Divine Alchemist Pavilion in public? Was he crazy?

That pharmacist was even more furious as he said, “Do you know what you are saying?! Is the Divine Alchemist Pavilion something that a young man like you can criticize?”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “I originally thought that the Divine Alchemist Pavilion was some sacred pavilion, but after seeing you, I am extremely disappointed in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

“Hehe, as if you’re qualified to evaluate the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?” The apothecary said with a sneer.

After saying that, he looked at the stall owner and said, “Sir, the decision is in your hands. You can decide for yourself.”

The stall owner was also somewhat conflicted. Of course, he trusted the Divine Alchemist Pavilion More, but he had personally witnessed the process of Qin Yu refining the pill.

He used his palm to refine the pill! Furthermore, he was in control of a Blue Spirit Fire!

“This... There’s no way to prove it,” the stall owner muttered.

He wasn’t on the verge of breaking through, so even if he consumed the Breakthrough Pill, it wouldn’t have any effect.

“Sir, I happen to be at the peak of Inner Strength Past Master realm recently. Why don’t you give this Breakthrough Pill to me, and I’ll give it a try?” Someone beside him said.

The stall owner glared at him and cursed angrily, “F * ck you. Dream on.”

“Then there’s no way to prove it.” The apothecary spread his hands and said with a nonchalant smile.

The stall owner’s face was full of confusion. For a moment, he didn’t know what decision to make.

“What, you don’t believe in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?” The apothecary struck while the iron was hot.

The stall owner gritted his teeth. He returned the Breakthrough Pill to Qin Yu and said apologetically, “I’m sorry, I only have this Purple Gold Gauze Cloth. I don’t want to take any risks, so... I hope you can forgive me.”

Qin Yu shook his head and took back the Breakthrough Pill. He nodded and said, “It’s alright. I understand.”

With that said, Qin Yu put away the Breakthrough Pill and turned to leave.

“Kiddo, can you lend me this pill to take a look?”

At this moment, a voice suddenly came from Qin Yu’s side.

Qin Yu saw a middle-aged man in his forties looking at him with a smile.

When the pharmacist of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion saw this person, his expression changed drastically!

“Elder... Sir, why are you here...” the pharmacist said hurriedly.

Elder? This middle-aged man was actually an Elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?

“Greetings, Elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion!” When everyone saw the situation, they all greeted him.

The Elder ignored them. He looked at Qin Yu and asked again, “Kiddo, can you lend me this pill to take a look?”

After experiencing this matter, Qin Yu had a very bad impression of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

Therefore, he said expressionlessly, “I think it’s better to forget it. With such shadiness, there’s no need for that.”

After saying this, Qin Yu prepared to leave.

The Elder hurriedly stopped Qin Yu and said, “Kiddo, there might be some misunderstanding. He alone can’t represent the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

“Moreover, the Divine Alchemist Pavilion has never lacked medicinal pills. It won’t be a loss for you to let me take a look.”

Qin Yu frowned, as if he had been persuaded.

Hence, Qin Yu handed the pill to the Elder.

After the Elder received the pill, he immediately began to observe it carefully.

His expression was somewhat strange, and he even looked at Qin Yu from time to time.

“From the Elder’s expression, the refinement of this Breakthrough Pill has indeed failed,” someone beside him muttered.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but snort coldly inside.

The Divine Alchemist Pavilion was indeed not as sacred as he had imagined.

“Strange.” The Elder finally spoke.

“Sir, how is it? This pill is fake, right?” Someone hurriedly asked.

The Elder didn’t say anything. He just kept stroking his chin.

Qin Yu was getting impatient. He said coldly, “You also think that this is fake, right? Return the pill to me. If there’s nothing else, I’ll leave.”

The Elder hurriedly waved his hand and said, “No, no, no, you’ve misunderstood me. I’m just lamenting that you’re not from the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, but why are your alchemy skills so superb?”

When he said this, everyone couldn’t help but feel stunned!

“Sir, you mean... this is really a Breakthrough Pill?” The stall owner asked anxiously.

The Elder nodded slightly and said, “Not only is it a Breakthrough Pill, but it’s also an extremely successful Breakthrough Pill!”

“Not many people in the entire Divine Alchemist Pavilion have such skills!”
