Chapter 621: The Physical Body of a Reversion Void Stage Powerhouse Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The statue on the square was dismantled as he wished.

Outside the door, a plaque of the Saint Confucian Sect was erected.

Zhen Yue watched all of this and wept silently, but she couldn’t do anything.

Ever since Qin Yu “died”, everything seemed to have changed. Even the world had changed.

No one dared to stand out and shout no to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association and the various aristocratic families!

All the martial artists were willing to submit to the various aristocratic families and the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

During this period of time, three geniuses appeared in the martial arts world.

It was said that these three geniuses had been personally promoted by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. Their strength had reached the intermediate stage of the Martial Marquis.

And these three people were practically invincible! Even the young masters of the various aristocratic families paled in comparison!

Jingdu, Yao family.

Yao Meng sat in the huge Yao family manor while quietly sipping her tea.

In front of her was Kong Yun, who was ranked second.

“Brother Kong, according to what I know, the next three people will be challenging you, right?” Yao Meng said with a nonchalant smile as she drank her coffee.

Kong Yun snorted. “These three people are quite arrogant. They really think that they are the ones who call the shots in the younger generation!”

Yao Meng smiled and said, “Brother Kong, don’t underestimate these three people. They have already defeated every single person on the ranking list.”

Kong Yun sneered and said, “So what? Meeting me is the beginning of their defeat.”

“I also received their challenge.”

At this time, Xiao Yuan suddenly walked in from outside the door.

Seeing Xiao Yuan, Yao Meng bowed and said, “Brother Xiao.”

Xiao Yuan also politely replied, “Miss Yao.”

“Did you accept the challenge?” Kong Yun asked with a fake smile.

Xiao Yuan shook his head and said with a smile, “Brother Kong, you should know that I don’t like to stand out, not to mention that these three people aren’t weak.”

Kong Yun snorted and said, “Where did these three people come from? It’s really sudden.”

“It’s said that in order to prevent the appearance of the next Qin Yu, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association specially created super powerhouses,” Xiao Yuan said with a nonchalant smile.

At the mention of Qin Yu, a trace of uneasiness flashed across the faces of the three people.

“Brother Xiao, do you think Qin Yu is really dead?” Yao Meng asked.

Xiao Yuan spread his hands and said, “Although I don’t want to believe that Brother Qin is already dead, more than a month has already passed. I’m afraid that he probably is.”

Yao Meng sighed and said, “Qin Yu’s appearance has indeed caused a huge stir in Jingdu, which has been peaceful for many years.”

Xiao Yuan smiled and said, “That’s right. Even the Jingdu Martial Arts Association attaches great importance to him. Yan Sihai even hired a peak-stage Martial Marquis to protect him. How many years has it been since someone was able to do this?”

Kong Yun sneered and said, “I don’t think that Qin Yu has much ability. If he met me, he would have died long ago.”

Xiao Yuan said politely, “Of course. Brother Kong’s strength is obvious to all.”

“By the way, I don’t know if the island from last time is still there. I should go there when I have time. The inner core there... is a holy object for cultivation,” Yao Meng suddenly said.

Xiao Yuan said jokingly, “Miss Yao, are you going there for the inner core or for Qin Yu?”

“Neither.” Yao Meng shook her head.

“I’m doing it for Yan Ruoxue.”

...

In the Immortal Slaying Sect.

Qin Yu was almost frozen into an ice sculpture. Even his eyelashes had turned white.

The dark energy here seemed to be endless. Even though Qin Yu was devouring it at an extremely fast speed, the dark energy here didn’t seem to be exhausted.

After such a long time, Qin Yu gradually understood the source of the dark energy.

This dark energy came from this coffin!

Qin Yu tried to cultivate in the coffin, but the strong dark energy almost took his life.

In the blink of an eye, another month passed.

In this one month, Qin Yu’s strength went from a rank two Martial Marquis to a rank four Martial Marquis.

If news of such a speed were to spread, it would shock the world.

Staying in this tomb, Qin Yu could hardly feel the passage of time. However, he felt a little uneasy at the bottom of his heart.

The worry about the outside world made Qin Yu even more panicked.

“The man with the mustache hasn’t come to find me yet. I guess not much time has passed,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Therefore, Qin Yu closed his eyes again and continued to cultivate.

Time flew by, and soon, time went winter from summer.

A new year arrived.

And Qin Yu had already stayed in this tomb for more than four months!

His entire body became extremely cold, and he could hardly feel any warmth.

On this day, Qin Yu’s closed eyes opened.

He frowned and said in a low voice, “I’ve reached a bottleneck again.”

Although Qin Yu had a chaotic body, his golden core needed to reach a balance.

The dark energy in his body had far surpassed the spiritual energy.

Solely by relying on the dark energy, Qin Yu’s cultivation was unable to advance even a little bit.

Qin Yu stood up and looked at the coffin. He couldn’t help but frown and say, “This is a treasure. I really can’t bear to give it up just like that.”

The gate of the Immortal Slaying Sect had been closed. After such a long time, no second wave of people had come in.

This was enough to show that the gate of the Immortal Slaying Sect couldn’t be opened from the outside.

“If I want to come here next time, I’m afraid I’ll have to rely on the man with the mustache,” Qin Yu muttered.

However, the man with the mustache came and went without a trace. He was too unreliable.

Thinking about it, Qin Yu had a bold idea!

He could take this coffin with him! Wouldn’t that mean he could absorb the dark energy from the coffin at any time?

Thinking of this, Qin Yu immediately stood up to move the coffin.

He didn’t know what it was made of, but it was heavy.

Even Qin Yu had a hard time moving it.

Fortunately, Qin Yu, who had stepped into the fourth rank Martial Marquis realm, had greatly increased strength. In the end, he moved the coffin into the Spatial Magic Artifact.

Qin Yu didn’t stay any longer. He turned around and was ready to leave.

However, after taking two steps, Qin Yu turned around and walked back.

He stared at the two male corpses in front of him and said in a low voice, “Nonsense, I’m afraid these two people are existences that have surpassed Mighty Realm powerhouses. They are powerhouses at the Reversion Void Stage!”

Above the Martial Saint Realm, there was the Soul Formation Stage. Mighty Realm powerhouses were one level above the Soul Formation Stage, and above the Mighty Realm Realm was the Reversion Void Stage!

It was said that those at the Reversion Void Stage were all invincible people. Their punch could even shatter a small planet!

Not to mention in the world, even if one looked back thousands of years, they would still be top-notch existences!

“Damn it, if these two male corpses can be used by me, then the Jingdu Martial Arts Association is nothing,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Even though these two male corpses had long lost their souls and spiritual sense, their bodies were genuine Reversion Void Stage powerhouses!

After thinking about it, Qin Yu decided to bring these two male corpses with him. He might have a chance to use them one day! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

No matter what, he could at least use these two male corpses as weapons.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu immediately put these two corpses into his Spatial Magic Artifact.
