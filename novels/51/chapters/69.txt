Chapter 70: I Hope You Cut off the Loan! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Mrs. Wei looked around in a daze, as if she didn’t understand the situation.

“Mom, you’re awake!” Seeing that Mrs. Wei had woken up, Wei Hang was so excited that tears flowed down his face!

Meanwhile, Wei Jiang rushed over and hugged Mrs. Wei!

“Honey, you’re awake. That’s great. That’s great...” This man in his forties was crying like a kid.

Mrs. Wei rubbed her forehead and tried to move her hands and feet. She exclaimed, “I... I don’t feel sick anymore...”

“Really?!” Wei Jiang wiped his tears and hurriedly said, “Honey, let me help you out of the bed!”

“No need.” Mrs. Wei reached out her hand to stop Wei Jiang.

She walked down from the bed herself.

Perhaps because she hadn’t walked for too long, Mrs. Wei’s footsteps were a little clumsy.

The Wei family’s father and son, afraid that something would happen to Mrs. Wei, followed closely by her side.

A few minutes later, Mrs. Wei exclaimed, “I’m really fine! I’m really fine!”

The family of three hugged each other tightly.

When he saw this touching scene, even Qin Yu was a little moved.

At this moment, Wei Jiang finally remembered Qin Yu.

He hurriedly walked in front of Qin Yu and knelt on the ground with a plop.

“I, Wei Jiang, will never forget your great kindness, Mr. Qin!” Wei Jiang said with great emotion.

“It was my fault for not recognizing your talent earlier. Please forgive me.” Wei Hang also knelt on the ground.

Qin Yu hurriedly helped the two of them up and said with a smile, “Mr. Wei, you don’t have to be so polite.”

“Mr. Qin, thank you for saving my life.” Mrs. Wei also walked forward and bowed slightly.

Qin Yu quickly returned the greeting with a smile.

“Mr. Qin, don’t leave tonight. I’ll cook for you myself. Let’s drink!” Wei Jiang said with some excitement.

Qin Yu didn’t want to ruin everyone’s mood, so he nodded and agreed.

Xu Maojun’s expression was extremely ugly. He couldn’t believe that Qin Yu had really cured Mrs. Wei!

“Who on earth is this guy...” Xu Maojun thought to himself.

At this moment, Wei Hang walked in front of him and said with a cold expression, “Return the money to me and get lost.”

Xu Maojun smiled embarrassedly and said, “Mr. Wei, although I didn’t cure her illness, you also used two bottles of my medicine. This money...”

“Cut the crap!” Wei Hang shouted!

“You’re already lucky enough that I didn’t settle the score with you,” Wei Hang said coldly.

Xu Maojun had no choice but to return the two million yuan.

At night, Wei Jiang and Wei Hang cooked a table full of dishes.

Wei Jiang even took out the good wine that he had treasured for many years and drank with Qin Yu.

After three rounds of wine, Wei Jiang looked at Wei Hang and said, “Go and take out the gifts that we’ve prepared.”

“Okay.” Wei Hang quickly nodded.

A few minutes later, Wei Hang came back with a gift box.

Before the gift box was opened, Qin Yu smelled a strong herbal aroma.

“This is...” Qin Yu sniffed hard, and couldn’t help but feel a little excited.

Wei Jiang said, “I heard from Miss Yan that you like herbs. This is the Changbai Mountain wild ginseng that a good friend of mine gave me a few years ago. Please accept it, Mr. Qin.”

Qin Yu hurriedly took the gift box, opened it, and sniffed it.

He couldn’t help but show a hint of excitement on his face!

This ginseng was probably more than thirty years old! It was almost the best herb that Qin Yu had ever seen!

“Mr. Wei, then I will accept it!” Qin Yu indeed needed herbs, so he accepted it directly.

Wei Jiang laughed loudly and said, “How can a mere herb compare to my wife’s life? Mr. Qin, if you need me in the future, just let me know!”

This reminded Qin Yu.

He handed the herbs to Yao Qing and then said in a sullen voice, “Mr. Wei, I really have something to ask you for help.”

“Mr. Qin, just let me know. As long as I can do it, I won’t refuse!” Wei Jiang patted his chest and said.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, and his eyes flashed with coldness.

Then, Qin Yu slowly said, “Has the Shen family recently borrowed a sum of money from the Chuzhou Bank?”

Wei Jiang froze, then nodded and said, “Yes, Shen Yun just applied for a large loan of two billion from our bank for three years. I have already agreed to it.”

Qin Yu said coldly, “Mr. Wei, I hope you will cut off his loan, refuse his loan, and never grant a loan to the Shen family in the future!”Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com
