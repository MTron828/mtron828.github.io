Chapter 897: Chapter 897, the top mystic realm master arrived 

Looking from the outside, the spiritual spring became wider, and the Qi/spiritual energy within it also became denser.

Li Yu walked out of the mystic realm.

The moment he stepped out, he smelled a pungent bloody smell.

This bloody smell even covered up the Qi/spiritual energy emitted from the spiritual spring.

The accumulation of countless corpses added a bit of yin energy to the Green Moon Villa.

The Yin Energy and the spiritual spring offset each other, inadvertently causing people to neglect this spiritual spring.

“This...”looking at the scene in front of him, even Li Yu, who was mentally prepared, couldn’t help but show a trace of fear on his face.

The huge Green Moon Villa had surprisingly become a purgatory on earth!

The corpses, human skin, and dried blood on the ground everywhere indicated that this place had experienced a disaster.

And those corpses were even more bizarre. Some had their skin peeled off, some had their bones extracted, and some had been fried and humiliated to death.

Looking at this scene, Li Yu’s face turned even paler.

This scene was far beyond his imagination.

“Green Moon Villa... they’re all dead...”Li Yu couldn’t help but mutter in a low voice.

He originally wanted to take a look and then go back, but seeing this scene, Li Yu started to worry.

After much thought, Li Yu finally decided to go scout for more information.

... . .

More than three months had passed.

In these three months, the fire country’s martial arts world had undergone an earth-shattering change.

Many sects had sprung up in great numbers, and the sects that possessed martial saints had shockingly become the true first rate sects in the world.

In order to firmly control them in their own hands, the Jingdu martial arts association had held many meetings.

This caused Gu Xinghe to be overwhelmed. He handed the task of finding Qin Yu to Zhai Xing while he was in charge of coordinating these sects.

“We don’t have enough manpower at all,”Gu Xinghe said with a frown.

“We have to bring people out of the second secret realm.”

The long-browed man next to him nodded and said, “Mm, apart from that, we should also use both grace and power to prevent any changes.”

Gu Xinghe glanced at long-browed man and said, “You mean to ask the JINGDU martial arts association to give up their benefits?”

“Not only do we have to give up their benefits, we also have to be generous.”Long-browed man took a deep breath.

Gu Xinghe was silent for a moment. He did not say anything, as if he was thinking about something.

After a while, Gu Xinghe nodded and said, “Okay, we’ll do as you say. Also, we have to recruit new people.”

The purple robe of the Jingdu martial arts association had been completely killed by Qin Yu. This also caused the JINGDU martial arts association to have no one to use.

Thus, under the leadership of Gu Xinghe, the recruitment of new people began.

...

On the other side, Li Yu went to Jingdu, the Divine Medicine Pavilion, and other places that might have changed to investigate.

When he learned that there were seven martial saints looking for Qin Yu, Li Yu could not help but suck in a breath of cold air.

“Seven martial saints... They are really willing to make a move.”Li Yu could not help but sigh.

Li Yu spent two whole days to investigate the changes in these three months. On the third day, he planned to return to the secret realm.

He rushed all the way to the Jade Moon Villa. He tiptoed and carefully walked to the vicinity of the spiritual spring.

This spiritual spring had already turned blood red. Although it contained Qi/spiritual energy, it was stained with a trace of rich bloody smell.

“There are seven martial saints guarding it. I must let Qin Yu hide it well,”Li Yu thought to himself.

Just as he was about to open the entrance to the secret realm, two people suddenly appeared beside him.

These two people had powerful internal qi and their strength had reached the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm!

At this moment, they were looking at Li Yu coldly.

“Who are you? What are you doing here?”These two people looked at Li Yu coldly and their eyes were filled with vigilance.

Li Yu’s expression changed slightly. He suppressed the panic in his heart and said with an embarrassed smile, “I heard that there was a massacre here, so I came to see if I can pick up some Babe...”

“Babe?”The two of them looked at each other and then said with a cold smile, “Even if there is a babe, can I leave it for you? It has long been taken away by Young Master Wan.”

“Young Master Wan? Which Young Master Wan?”Li Yu asked tentatively.

“Of course it’s the Wan Gu Qiong! You Don’t Even Know Young Master Wan, yet you still dare to come here to search for treasures?”The two people sneered.

Li Yu nodded and seemed to be deep in thought. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“If there’s nothing else, hurry up and leave. Outsiders are not allowed to enter here.”The two people waved their hands and said.

Li Yu hurriedly nodded and said, “Okay, I’ll leave now, I’ll leave now...”

Under such circumstances, Li Yu had no way to enter the mystic realm, so he could only leave temporarily.

“HM? There seems to be Qi/spiritual energy here.”At this moment, one of them noticed something strange in the spiritual spring.

“This Qi/spiritual energy... seems to be coming from the front.”

“This is the Saint Confucian sect’s spiritual spring. I’ve heard of it before.”

“Alright, stop looking. Tomorrow, Master Du, the Mystic Realm Master, will come to inspect this place. We’d better guard it well.”

The two of them discussed softly, but Li Yu heard everything clearly.

After a few days of probing, Li Yu naturally knew who master Du was.

That was the legendary Mystic Realm Master! He controlled tens of thousands of secret keys!

His name was like thunder to any Mystic Realm Master!

“This is bad. If du Xuanyu were to come, he would definitely discover the abnormality here.”Li Yu thought to himself.

“With his ability, it would be effortless for him to open this secret realm...”
