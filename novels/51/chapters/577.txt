Chapter 578: Yan Guiyi’s Attack Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Bad news came one after another, but everyone seemed to have gotten used to it.

Qin Yu had long become a regular on the Martial Arts Forum. It would be strange if he didn’t scroll through it one day.

Qin Yu also saw the news.

Qin Yu didn’t know anything about Yan Guiyi or Ma Hai’s mentor.

But he knew that the people sent by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association were definitely not ordinary people.

Qin Yu put away his phone.

For the next three days, Qin Yu would probably have to hide for a while.

He found a place to stay for the time being.

Then, Qin Yu took out his phone and clicked on the video.

The video was the one that Yan Yongxiu had sent.

Qin Yu stared at the video, and a trace of hesitation and anguish flashed across his face.

It was impossible to go to the Martial Arts Association to ask for Yan Ruoxue now!

But Qin Yu couldn’t bear to see Yan Ruoxue suffer!

No one knew when it would end!

So, Qin Yu wanted to release this video!

This way, the Yan family would definitely go to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association to ask for Yan Ruoxue.

“Ruoxue... I can only do this.” Qin Yu took a deep breath, and a trace of anguish flashed across his face.

Of course, he didn’t want others to see his beloved suffer, but Qin Yu had no other choice.

Just as Qin Yu took out his phone and was about to play the video, he suddenly felt a few powerful internal qis rushing toward him!

“Oh no.” Qin Yu’s expression changed.

The strength of this internal qi was far beyond his imagination!

“The people from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association are so fast.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

He didn’t dare to stay any longer. He immediately stood up and left the hotel.

Not long after Qin Yu left, a man wearing black and gold clothes led several people into the room.

This man was tall, and his internal qi was cold.

His hands were behind his back, and he looked like a powerhouse.

“We actually let him escape. It seems that this guy is very vigilant,” Yan Guiyi said coldly.

“Mr. Yan, what should we do now?” The attendant beside him asked.

Yan Guiyi sneered. “No one can escape from my hands.”

With that, he walked to Qin Yu’s bed and tossed and turned, as if he was looking for something.

Finally, he picked up a strand of hair from the bed.

This strand of hair came from Qin Yu!

Then, Yan Guiyi’s palm shimmered with light, and strands of internal qi entered Yan Guiyi’s glabella.

“He went in the southeast direction. He hasn’t gone far yet. Chase after him,” Yan Guiyi said coldly

“Yes!”

The few of them immediately followed behind Yan Guiyi and sped toward the southeast direction.

...

Qin Yu used Shrinking Ground Into An Inch to quickly increase the distance between the two of them.

Only when he was sure that no one was chasing after him did Qin Yu let out a sigh of relief.

He took out his phone and clicked on the video again.

“Sorry, Ruoxue.” Qin Yu clicked on the upload button.

In a few short moments, this video was uploaded to all the major platforms!

The title was even more eye-catching: Jingdu Martial Arts Association Harming the Yan family’s Daughter, the Yan Family Doesn’t Care About It.

After posting the video, Qin Yu temporarily sat down and waited for the video to spread.

After about half an hour, Qin Yu took out his phone to see the effect.

But at this time, he discovered that all the videos had been blocked!

Qin Yu stood up abruptly! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

His expression was somewhat ugly as he said in a low voice, “How could this be...”

Qin Yu tried to continue uploading, but discovered that even his own account had been deleted!

This enraged Qin Yu!

“Looks like this method is not going to work.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

He had underestimated the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, and he had underestimated the Yan family.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth, and his expression was extremely dark.

“If it really doesn’t work, I will crash the press conference!” Qin Yu said coldly.

There were countless large-scale press conferences held in Pyro. As long as this video was released at the press conference, even the Yan family would not be able to hide it at that time!

Just as Qin Yu was deep in thought, he once again felt the numerous powerful waves of internal qi!

“They have caught up to us so quickly?” Qin Yu frowned.

He didn’t dare to waste any more time. He once again used the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique and continued to flee.

Yan Guiyi and the others soon arrived near Qin Yu.

“We actually let him escape again,” Yan Guiyi said coldly.

“This kid seems to be able to sense our arrival,” the person next to him said.

Yan Guiyi narrowed his eyes and said in a low voice, “It seems that this kid’s divine sense is quite powerful... but unfortunately, it’s useless!”

Yan Guiyi waved his hand, and a ray of light fell on everyone’s bodies.

This was a technique commonly used by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. As long as one used this technique, one could hide one’s internal qi and avoid being detected by others.

Then, Yan Guiyi closed his eyes, as if he was looking for Qin Yu’s position.

“He’s fleeing in the northeast direction. Let’s go after him,” Yan Guiyi said coldly.

“Yes.”

The few of them followed behind Yan Guiyi and sped off again!

This time, Qin Yu escaped to a valley.

The surroundings were quiet. There were mountains and rivers. It was a good place for cultivation.

“They seem to be able to track my location.” Qin Yu frowned.

He estimated the time. The time for them to chase was about half an hour.

In other words, they would catch up in half an hour.

Therefore, Qin Yu had to change places every half an hour.

Qin Yu didn’t know about Yan Guiyi’s strength, so he didn’t dare to take the risk.

Because once he was caught, he would have no chance to save Yan Ruoxue.

Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the ground while slowly recovering his internal qi.

Time flew. About twenty minutes later, Qin Yu opened his eyes.

He glanced at his watch and said in a low voice, “It’s about time to change to the next place.”

However, just as Qin Yu was about to get up and leave, four figures suddenly shot out from the darkness!

These four people were all Martial Marquises. They stood in four different directions and blocked Qin Yu’s way!

Qin Yu frowned and said in a low voice, “I’m actually one step too late.”

He looked at the four people and asked coldly, “Who are you people?”

The four people didn’t say anything and only looked at Qin Yu coldly.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “Are you guys mute? What a bunch of trash. Do It. Don’t waste my time.”

“How bold.”

At this moment, another figure slowly walked out.

This person was none other than Yan Guiyi!

His expression was calm, and almost no fluctuations of internal qi could be seen.

But even so, Qin Yu could still feel that this person was extraordinary.

Yan Guiyi had two black and gold balls in his hands while slowly walking toward Qin Yu.

“You’re Yan Guiyi?” Qin Yu squinted his eyes and asked.

Yan Guiyi smiled and said, “Since you have heard of me, then follow me back. Otherwise, you will suffer.”

“Go to h*ll. I’ll make you suffer instead.” Qin Yu cursed.
