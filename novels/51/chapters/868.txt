Chapter 869: Chapter 869, the divine residence of the Snow Mountain! 

The outbreak of the pill injury made Qin Yu’s face pale, and his entire body lost strength in an instant.

Seeing Qin Yu’s appearance, everyone couldn’t help but sneer.

Zhang Yi Jiu, who was at the side, couldn’t figure it out.

With such strength, why did he still dare to come to the cold palace to court death?

“How about it? Hand over the mask.”Brother song walked in front of Qin Yu and said condescendingly.

Qin Yu wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth. He stood up from the ground and slowly adjusted his body condition.

“There are only four half-step martial saints in your Han Palace?”Qin Yu sneered.

Brother song raised his eyebrows and said with some sarcasm, “What? Four half-step martial saints can’t Kill You?”

Qin Yu glanced around and said with some doubt, “There’s a problem that I can’t figure out. Almost no one knows about the news of the mask. How does your Han Palace Know About It?”

Brother song frowned and said, “Does this have anything to do with you?”

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Of course it has nothing to do with me. I’m just suspecting that you know about the news about the mask, but why don’t you know anything about my strength?”

“What do you mean?”Brother song frowned.

Qin Yu grinned and said with a cold smile, “What do you think?”

Before he finished his words, a burst of dazzling golden light burst out from Qin Yu’s body!

He clenched his fist and the golden light flowed along his arm and erupted from his fist!

Brother song was not afraid at all. He mocked, “With your little strength, you dare to fight with me? You’re simply courting death!”

With that said, Brother Song clenched his fist and came forward to meet him!

When his fist was about to touch, brother song’s expression suddenly changed drastically!

He felt the powerful force that erupted from Qin Yu’s fist and immediately felt that things were not good!

However, it was too late to retreat now! Brother song could only brace himself and charge forward!

“Crack!”

At the moment of contact, the Golden Light on Qin Yu’s fist immediately exploded!

A path several meters long was directly blasted out from the snow-filled ground!

That golden light seemed to be able to split the snow-filled ground into two halves!

Looking at the golden light that filled the sky, everyone could not help but suck in a breath of cold air!

Brother song was even more miserable. Half of his arm exploded, and the remaining power shattered his body!

“Wah!”

Brother song, who was lying on the ground, opened his mouth, and a mouthful of blood mixed with internal organs spurted out.

“Did this kid just hide his strength?”Zhang Yi Jiu thought to himself.

The expressions of the others also became somewhat solemn.

Qin Yu moved his wrists and sneered, “What? Is that all you have?”

Brother song got up from the ground and said coldly, “Treacherous kid, you actually hid your strength...”

Qin Yu did not explain. He looked at the people in front of him coldly and said, “You guys go up together.”

Brother song laughed loudly and said, “Arrogant! You are just relying on the strength of your physical body. As long as we don’t get close to you, I will kill you with just a raise of my hand!”

As he spoke, brother song slowly moved his hands, and the heavy snow in front of him immediately flew towards him!

It was as if brother song could control the heavy snow, and every snowflake contained an unparalleled power!

“Go to hell!”

Accompanied by Brother Song’s furious roar, his fingers slightly curved, and the snowflakes that filled the sky immediately shot towards Qin Yu!

The countless snowflakes carried a sharp power, and Qin Yu had almost nowhere to hide!

“This is only the beginning!”Brother Song said with a cold smile.

His palm once again slid, and the surrounding snow mountains actually began to explode!

The ice seemed to be endowed with life, and all of them flew towards Qin Yu!

The surrounding snowflakes, Snow Mountains, and icicles all became Qin Yu’s enemies at this moment!

Qin Yu clenched his fist and shattered icicles one after another!

However, this was an extremely cold area after all. The ice and snow were inexhaustible!

“If this goes on, I will definitely die of exhaustion.”Qin Yu frowned.

He looked at brother song not far away and said in a low voice, “Only by killing him can we stop this endless attack.”

Thinking of this, Qin Yu’s body exploded with golden light, and he rushed towards brother song with big steps!

But how could brother song give Qin Yu a chance so easily? With a slight movement of his palm, the two huge snow mountains turned into a cage, directly trapping Qin Yu’s way!

“Hahaha!”Seeing this, brother song could not help but laugh out loud.

“Kid, I’m Invincible Here!”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He suddenly smashed the snow mountain cage in front of him with a punch.

Before Qin Yu could get close, the ice under his feet suddenly turned into two big hands and grabbed Qin Yu’s ankles!

“Crash...”

The surrounding ice and snow quickly covered Qin Yu. In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu was covered by the ice and snow, almost turning into an ice man!

“It’s time to end this!”

Brother Song roared. His body rose into the air and his hands slowly lifted up.

The surrounding icebergs and snowflakes also rose up!

These icebergs and snowflakes all gathered in the sky above Qin Yu.

At a glance, it was like a towering mountain!

“Watch how I suppress you!”Brother Song’s hands quickly pressed down!

The countless amounts of ice and snow immediately pressed down on Qin Yu’s body!

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu’s body was covered with an ice mountain that was hundreds of meters tall! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

This snow mountain seemed to be under brother song’s control. Under his control, the already huge snow mountain instantly became incomparably heavy!

This enormous strength made Qin Yu unable to move at all. Even if Qin Yu had immense strength, he was unable to break through this snow mountain!

Brother song slowly walked towards Qin Yu. He looked down at Qin Yu and said, “Here, I am invincible.”

Qin Yu struggled with all his strength, but this ice mountain was too big. It almost made Qin Yu unable to move.

“Kid, it’s time to send you on your way,”brother Song said coldly.

He extended his palm, and a sharp blade made of ice and snow appeared in his hand.

“Go to hell!”Brother song roared, and the sharp blade in his hand stabbed towards Qin Yu’s glabella!

At this critical moment, Qin Yu’s pupils suddenly constricted, and a golden light burst out from between his glabella!

“Divine judgment!”Qin Yu shouted!

The Golden Light instantly entered between brother song’s glabella!

In an instant, brother song’s spiritual sense seemed to be struck by lightning, and his body fell to the ground unconsciously!

His spiritual sense was almost torn apart, and the intense pain made brother song’s face contort!

“You... you want to destroy my spiritual sense... you... Ah! ! !”Brother song held his head and wailed in pain!

He tried his best to resist, and the light in his mind kept on shining.

Layers of secret sweat broke out on brother song’s forehead.

At this moment, brother song was not in the mood to control the snow mountain. Qin Yu took this opportunity to shatter the snow mountain and step out!

At the same time, Brother Song also survived the divine judgment.

His realm was higher than Qin Yu’s, so it was difficult for the divine judgment to directly erase his spiritual sense.

“Kid... What kind of move is this...”brother song said with some lingering fear.

Qin Yu sneered, “You don’t need to know.”

Brother song took a deep breath and said in a low voice, “I almost died in your hands. I really underestimated you...”

“Me too.”Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said.

Brother Song took a step back and said with a sneer, “Qin Yu, I won’t hold back anymore. Everything is going to end!”

Brother song roared angrily and shouted, “Snow mountain divine residence, come out!”
