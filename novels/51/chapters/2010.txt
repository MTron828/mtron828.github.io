2011 The Chaos Grave

The reason why Xiao Yu protected the demonic egg was that it was very important to her.

In that case, Xiao Yu would naturally protect Jue Wu to protect the demonic egg.

After bidding farewell to Jue Wu, Qin Yu left Five Mountain City, planning to head to Divine Fortuity City.

Similarly, Divine Fortuity City was a very small city. It was more like a marketplace than a city.

The top-notch magical artifacts in the Holy Region were being sold here. Provided you had money or treasure, you could definitely find your desired magical artifact here.

It was too bad that Divine Fortuity City was not as safe as other cities. On the contrary, it was a place not within the jurisdiction of any of the neighboring magistrates. Stepping into Divine Fortuity City, one would have to take care of their own safety. Killing and looting were common here.

Qin Yu’s journey to Divine Fortuity City was relatively safe, and it was even relatively quiet.

When Qin Yu arrived at Divine Fortuity City, three days had passed.

Qin Yu thought of the part material of the Saint Weapon in his hands. After much thought, he decided to take the opportunity to forge a Saint Weapon for himself in the Divine Fortuity City.

As soon as he stepped into the Divine Fortuity City, a mysterious internal qi assailed him. It was like various ancient internal qi that had fused together and was extremely strange.

Many shops were on both sides of the Divine Fortuity City. The shops were not big from their looks, but they had tremendous mysterious magical artifacts.

Cultivators with extraordinary internal qi were standing at the entrance of the shops.

They had powerful strength, and most of them came here to guard the shops.

In other words, anyone who could open a shop in Divine Fortuity City must have a powerful background. Otherwise, they would have been ransacked long ago.

After making many inquiries, Qin Yu soon arrived at a shop.

A flirtatious woman stood at the door of the shop. She sized up Qin Yu and said, “Little brother, do you want to buy something?”

“I want to buy a magical artifact that can conceal internal qi,” Qin Yu said.

“You’ve chosen the right place,” the woman said with a flirtatious smile. After saying that, she invited Qin Yu into the house earnestly.

Soon after Qin Yu entered the shop with this woman, he saw the magical artifacts displayed in various cabinets, and each was quite extraordinary.

After glancing around, Qin Yu said, “Please help me find a few magical artifacts that can hide internal qi.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

As the woman rummaged through, she chatted with Qin Yu. “Little brother, you are also preparing for the Chaos Grave, are you?”

“What Chaos Grave?” Qin Yu was stunned and frowned.

“Don’t you know?” The woman was slightly surprised and explained, “Not long ago, the Yao family found a Mystic Realm in a barren mountain. Rumor has it that it was a Chaos Grave, and a perfect chaotic corpse was hidden there.”

Qin Yu was instantly shocked. He hurriedly asked, “Lady Boss, where is the place you mentioned?”

“How should I describe it?” The woman thought for a while, then roughly described a place and its landscape.

After listening to her description, Qin Yu seemed to have recalled something.

Wasn’t that the Tai Chi Diagram he had discovered not long ago? A chaotic body corpse was actually hidden there!

“No wonder the skeleton reacted to me,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

“Has the Chaos Grave opened yet?” Qin Yu pretended to ask casually.

The lady boss smiled and said, “Not yet. I heard it requires a secret technique to move the earth to open it. Now, the nine great aristocratic families have already sent people to try to use the formation. I think it won’t be long before the formation can open it.”

Qin Yu was slightly excited. Once the corpse of the chaotic body appeared, it would probably alarm the entire Holy Region!

Qin Yu was a chaotic body himself. If he could obtain this corpse, he could pry into the chaotic body’s secret of cultivating. Even if he could just borrow the corpse, he could avoid the detours of cultivation.

“Lady Boss, do you know what cultivation realm that corpse is at?” Qin Yu asked.

The lady boss rummaged through the items and said, “I don’t know the specifics, but there are rumors that he must be above the True Saint. ”

“Phew.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu was instantly incomparably excited.

He suppressed the excitement in his heart and asked casually, “Lady Boss, why aren’t you going?”

“Hahaha! I’m not as stupid as them. Why would I waste my time?” The lady boss shook her head.

As she spoke, she had already taken out a few magical artifacts and placed them in front of Qin Yu.

“What do you mean?” Qin Yu tried to probe.

The lady boss smiled and said, “Don’t forget the Holy Son of the Si family is a chaotic body. He hasn’t stepped into the Semi Saint cultivation realm yet. If he can get this corpse, the Holy Son of the Sii family will naturally take the opportunity to comprehend the dao.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. The lady boss was right. No matter what price they had to pay, the Si family would never give up on this corpse.

“Little brother, take a look and see which one you’ll choose,” the woman said.

Qin Yu picked up a cloak from the table.

This cloak was big. It was like an umbrella, and a veil was hanging around it, which was quite beautiful.

“I’ll take this one,” Qin Yu shook it and said.

Then he put the cloak on his head.

Immediately after, Qin Yu felt a mysterious internal qi gathering in front of his face. Looking from the outside, he could only see a patch of fog.

“What’s the price?” Qin Yu said as he picked up the cloak.

The lady boss stretched out a finger and said, “10 billion.”

“So expensive?” Qin Yu was stunned and asked in surprise.

The lady boss smiled faintly. “If you think it’s expensive, I feel the same. If you had come two days earlier, you could have bought it for at most one billion. However, due to Chaos Grave, the price of this item has increased. If you don’t buy it today, it will be more expensive tomorrow.”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and felt it made sense.

However, 10 billion was still too expensive for Qin Yu.

...

“Why don’t you take this one? This one can be slightly cheaper,” The lady boss took out a tremendously ugly mask and said.

“I’ll take this cloak,” Qin Yu shook his head and said.

After saying that, Qin Yu took out his card. Then, with a thought, he transferred the 10 billion from the card.

The 10 billion spirit coins turned into a faint light and entered the lady boss’s card.

“By the way, I want to ask you something,” Qin Yu said as he kept away the cloak.

“You have to pay to inquire about something,” the lady boss said with a smile.

Hearing this, Qin Yu could not help but stick out his tongue.

The people of Divine Fortuity City were really obsessed with money.

“So be it.” Qin Yu didn’t want to be calculative.

Before Qin Yu could inquire, a few people walked in from outside.

The man leading was a young man with a folding fan in his hand. He looked rather handsome.

...

Two elderly men were behind him, who seemed to be the young man’s attendants.
