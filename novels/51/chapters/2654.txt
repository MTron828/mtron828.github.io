Chapter 2655: Valley Master

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

At this moment, it was as if they had arrived in a foggy space in the Heart of the Holy Kingdom.

Qin Yu’s divine soul entered it but found nothing.

Closing his eyes, he carefully sensed the changes in the power within. The power of rules brushed gently over his divine soul.

Some changes in power were perceived by Qin Yu. With a mere thought, a force that wasn’t his own surged within his divine soul.

Fleeing Shadow!

Qin Yu’s body suddenly appeared at the far end of the room.

Ling Bo! With a light step, his body was already traversing the ceiling.

Ethereal!

In an instant, his body became as weightless as paper, flowing with the wind.

After nearly ten minutes, the power abruptly receded from Qin Yu’s divine soul, and his body gently descended to the ground.

But his eyes suddenly sparkled.

The Heart of the Saint Kingdom wasn’t as useless as he presumed.

After using the power of the seal, he could closely observe its utilization. With the aid of the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze, when employing the Demon Sealing Valley’s techniques, the flow of Saint Power within his body and the allocation of his physical strength became crystal clear.

Empowered by the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze, it was akin to having a master guide him.

Despite being unable to directly master the Demon Sealing Valley’s techniques, with a few more uses, he might wield them as adeptly as Jing Xin and the others!

Suppressing his inner elation, Qin Yu acknowledged that for Aiden, lacking the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze, the Heart of the Saint Kingdom merely stored a skill.

However, for Qin Yu, capturing this power might grant him complete mastery. “The prowess of these techniques isn’t profoundly complex. It appears that the Heart of the Saint Kingdom will soon harness this power again, perhaps within a day. Yet, if it captures a mightier force, the interval until its next use may lengthen. This bears resemblance to my Seal of Heaven Returning.”

Qin Yu ruminated.

Amidst his contemplation, a faint sound emanated from the inner hall’s bed.

“Peak Master, are you alright?”

Qin Yu turned to find the peak master had emerged.

Witnessing the peak master’s unhealed eyes, nose, and ears, Qin Yu felt an indescribable pang of discomfort.

The peak master shook his head, fashioning a cloth strip from his robe to blindfold himself.

“Don’t worry. Losing my sight allows me to see more clearly. Qin Yu, find a way to rescue our captured comrades. All five of them belong to our Demon-slaying Peak.”

The peak master conveyed in writing to Qin Yu.

“Rest assured, Peak Master, even if it costs me my life, I will rescue our comrades from the Demon-slaying Peak.”

Qin Yu said sternly. Back then, the Demon-slaying Peak had exhausted all their merits under the leadership of Senior Brother Jiu Xiao to exchange for celestial artifacts just to aid Qin Yu. Now, he intended to repay the Demon-slaying Peak as he did in the past.

The peak master hesitated for a while before finally writing the words ‘thank you’ on Qin Yu’s hand.

At this moment, in the core area of a level within the Demon Sealing Valley, two great elders and eight regular elders stood on either side of the Great Hall.

In the central position, an elderly man in loose Daoist robes, with his hair tied up, sat on a cushion.

“Valley Master, you’ve finally returned!” Jing Xin’s face was filled with immense joy.

“Yes, finally back, as if I’ve awoken from a dream,” the old man murmured, his cheeks gently trembling.

After a few words, a long silence followed.

Finally, Elder Xin Yue couldn’t contain herself and spoke up again.

“Valley Master, Elder Gu Yi is currently ruthlessly plundering the outsiders, killing them.”

The old man waved his hand and slowly rose from his seat.

“I’m aware of all this…”

Gu Yi nodded slightly, then assisted the old man as he stood up from the cushion.

“The history of the Demon Sealing Valley is ancient. First, there was the Ancient Demon Land, then the Demon Sealing Valley. Guarding this place is our inherent destiny. If the Holy Lord hadn’t fallen, none of this would have changed. But now, change is upon us.”

With those words, Xin Yue’s expression immediately shifted.

It should be noted that Valley Master Dan had always upheld the previous order, regardless of circumstances. But now, it seemed there were some changes afoot.

“Valley Master!” Xin Yue’s voice carried a note of urgency.

“Let me finish first.”

Xin Yue’s face showed displeasure, and she immediately backed off, her face turning ashen. She dared not speak out again.

“Since the Holy Lord’s demise, many things have changed,” Dan said solemnly. “The theft of the power of Saint Kingdom, the transformation of the remnants of Wu Tian’s broken body suppressed in the Ancient Demon Land, his sealed arm has broken free, and the other arm, also suppressed in the Emerald Serpent Witch’s Saint Kingdom, has somehow appeared here and merged with his power. Now, his power has spiraled out of control.

Even Xin Yue was taken aback by Dan’s words. Had the situation truly spiraled out of control to this extent?

“When Wu Tian completely breaks free, he will undoubtedly launch an attack on the Demon Sealing Valley. What will become of us then? Wu Tian’s power cannot be vanquished. It has long surpassed our ability to contend with, even in its current fragmented state. Otherwise, Holy Lord Chen Shuang would not have expended such immense power to suppress this arm,” Dan analyzed.

“What should we do then?” Gu Yi frowned.

“I’ve attempted to locate the outsider who stole the Saint Power from this region, but to no avail. Their cunning surpasses my expectations. Many outsiders here possess the Heart of Saint Kingdom, so we must rely on their strength to aid in our defense. Our experience has allowed more individuals to survive within the Demon Sealing Valley.” Dan shook his head. Fôll0w current novÊls on n/o/(v)/3l/b((in).(co/m)

“Why must you insist on this course of action, Valley Master? With the current upheaval in this region, it presents an opportunity for us to escape this fate. Why should we perish here?” Gu Yi’s expression soured.

“Gu Yi, we are born from the essence of this world. Even with the demise of the Holy Lord and the collapse of the region’s order, it merely alleviates our constraints. If we were to venture into a territory not our own, the power of this Saint Kingdom would detect us and obliterate us utterly. Accept your fate. This is the duty of our Demon Sealing Valley and our destiny,” Dan responded with a faint smile as if he had contemplated this scenario before.

“I refuse to accept this! Why does the Holy Lord treat us so unjustly? If that’s the case, then I won’t spare a single one of those chosen by the Holy Lord’s divine flame rune! If you’re heartless, don’t blame me for being ruthless!” Gu Yi

roared with frustration..
