Chapter 824: Comprehension Once Again!

Qin Yu’s body emitted a sacred golden light.

This light was extremely warm, illuminating the entire first level of the Scripture Pavilion.

When everyone saw this scene, their expressions were extremely complicated.

“How... How is this possible?” Kong Yun couldn’t help but clench his fists!

He, who was extremely competitive, couldn’t accept this at this moment!

Yao Meng’s beautiful eyes were filled with astonishment.

In just four hours, he had comprehended a Divine Rank spell. This was really... too exaggerated!

“Buzz!”

As the light converged, Qin Yu’s spell could be considered to have been completely comprehended.

He opened his eyes slightly. The first thing that entered his sight was the shocked expressions of everyone.

Qin Yu stood up from the ground and frowned. “How long did I use?”

“Brother Qin, you only used four hours and five minutes!” Zhuang Teng said with some excitement.

“It’s really unheard of to comprehend a Divine Rank spell in four hours.”

“We really underestimated you just now.”

Yao Meng smiled and said, “Mr. Qin’s talent really makes us envious.”

However, Qin Yu frowned and said, “It actually took so long...”

When he said this, everyone couldn’t help but roll their eyes.

It was a little ridiculous to pretend.

However, in Qin Yu’s heart, he really thought that it had taken too long.

Because Qin Yu’s killing intent was too strong, his state of mind was naturally affected, so he slowed down.

Otherwise, he would definitely be faster.

Qin Yu put the vajra sacred physique back to its original position.

In the face of everyone’s praise, Qin Yu thanked them one by one.

“Oh right, didn’t someone just say that he would eat sh*t while standing on his head?” Qin Yu’s gaze landed on Teng Hui.

Teng Hui’s expression instantly turned extremely ugly.

He gritted his teeth and said, “You must have comprehended the vajra sacred physique long ago! You were just pretending for us just now!”

Once these words were said, everyone seemed to have reacted.

That’s right! What if Qin Yu had already mastered the vajra sacred physique technique?

Looking at everyone’s expressions, Qin Yu couldn’t help but shake his head.

“If you don’t believe me, I’ll comprehend another Divine Rank spell,” said Qin Yu.

He looked at Teng Hui and said, “You can pick. Any one of them is fine.”

Teng Hui gritted his teeth and quickly turned around to walk towards the bookcase.

He carefully selected from the bookcase and finally took out a book and threw it to Qin Yu.

There were a few words written on the book: God Buddha’s thousand hands!

This spell was also a Divine Rank spell, and it was even harder to comprehend compared to the vajra sacred physique just now!

“If you can comprehend this God Buddha’s thousand hands, I’ll believe you!” Teng Hui said coldly.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Okay, no problem. But... if I can comprehend this God Buddha’s thousand hands, it won’t be as simple as eating one pile of shit. You’ll get two piles.”

After saying this, Qin Yu no longer paid attention to Teng Hui.

He took the spell to the side and continued to comprehend.

This time, everyone stared at Qin Yu with eager eyes.

They also wanted to see if Qin Yu could comprehend a Divine Rank spell in a day!

Time passed by minute by second, and in the blink of an eye, three hours had passed.

During these three hours, Qin Yu didn’t open his eyes.

Rays of light from this spell surged into Qin Yu’s mind.

Soon, four and a half hours had passed, but Qin Yu still didn’t open his eyes.

This made Teng Hui heave a sigh of relief.

He snorted coldly and said, “I told you that it was impossible for Qin Yu to comprehend a Divine Rank spell so quickly!”

“It seems that he has indeed comprehended the vajra sacred physique long ago.”

This made everyone slightly relieved.

After all, if he really comprehended a Divine Rank spell in four hours, it would be too much pressure for everyone!

“Everyone says that Qin Yu has great talent and can suppress his peers. I think he’s just a braggart!” Teng Hui snorted and turned to leave.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s body emitted a golden light again!

That holy internal qi spread out again!

Teng Hui’s figure, which was just about to leave, suddenly froze on the spot.

His forehead was covered with layers of sweat, and his expression was extremely ugly!

“Hu.”

Qin Yu’s voice came from behind.

He slowly stood up, played with this God Buddha’s thousand hands book, and said, “I have to say, this technique seems to be even harder to comprehend.”

“Brother Qin is too awesome!” Zhuang Teng gave Qin Yu a thumbs up.

“In these ten hours, you’ve comprehended two Divine Rank spells. If this gets out, I’m afraid that people’s jaws will drop!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“We aren’t worth mentioning in front of Brother Qin.”

Qin Yu smiled. “Everyone, you’re too polite. I was just lucky.”

Then, Qin Yu handed the God Buddha’s thousand hands to Zhuang Teng.

Then, Qin Yu’s gaze fell on Teng Hui.

“Teng Hui, do you have anything to say now?” Qin Yu asked calmly.

Teng Hui braced himself and turned around. He gritted his teeth and said, “You are ruthless!”

“That’s it? You have to eat two turds of shit,” Qin Yu said with a faint smile.

Teng Hui was so embarrassed that he became angry. “Who knows if you’ve already comprehended the God Buddha’s thousand hands!”

“Teng Hui, what you said is a bit too overboard,” Zhuang Teng rolled his eyes and said.

“You picked the spell. Could it be that Qin Yu knows all kinds of spells?”

“That’s right. If you want to go back on your word, just say that you want to go back on your word. Don’t make excuses for yourself.”

Teng Hui’s face was flushed, and he was obviously exasperated.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “The Scripture Pavilion is a sacred place. It’s not appropriate for you to eat sh*t here. Let’s talk about it after we get out.”

Teng Hui couldn’t help but sigh in relief.

If he ate sh*t in front of so many people, then the Teng family would be completely disgraced!

“As long as I leave this Scripture Pavilion, I must think of a way to slip away.” Teng Hui made up his mind.

Qin Yu didn’t pay attention to Teng Hui anymore.

He scanned his surroundings and quickly gave up on the idea of finding the spirit binding technique.

It was impossible for him to find the spirit binding technique in a short period of time by himself.

“It looks like... I still have to attack the Jingdu Martial Arts Association,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Only in this way could he enter the Scripture Pavilion indefinitely.

Of course, it would be even better if he could capture Gu Xinghe alive.

It would be impossible for Gu Zizhen to refuse to exchange the spirit binding technique for his?son.

Qin Yu didn’t waste any more time. He turned around and left the first floor before heading towards the fourth floor.

The fourth floor recorded the history of the development of martial arts.

Qin Yu wanted to see the masked woman from ten thousand years ago.

As well as... the historical records of his father.

He went all the way to the fourth floor.

The fourth floor seemed extremely spacious.

There were only eight books on the huge floor.

These eight books recorded different ages.

The smallest one recorded nearly 200 years worth of information about the martial arts world.
