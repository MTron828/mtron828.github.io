2315 Jue Wu Awakens

Qin Yu smiled and did not answer Mei Li’s question.

He had not fought with a genius of the Holy Region yet, so he could not judge his strength.

Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the mountain peak, carefully comprehending what he had obtained this time.

His mind focused on the divine sense spirit bead that had absorbed Nightmare’s Sea of Soul and was condensed to perfection using the Soul-Torment Mind Technique.

All the soul power of the Sea of Soul out there probably could not even compare to one-tenth of this spirit bead.

He moved slightly, and a destructive divine sense shot out from the spirit bead like a wandering dragon.

A force of heavenly might permeated the space enveloped by his divine sense.

As if the master of this world, Qin Yu could vaguely feel an invincible aura lurking in his soul.

“Heavenly might! Why does your soul power contain heavenly might?”

Mei Li cried out involuntarily. She exerted strong control over her body to resist that invincible aura.

As long as she slightly heaved a sigh of relief, her body would involuntarily kneel down.

Qin Yu withdrew the divine sense formed by the spirit bead and asked with a frown.

“Is this the power of tribulation surpassing the True Saint Realm? But it seemed to differ from Xing Xiu’s soul. His soul was much stronger when he fought with me back then.”

“You actually fought with Xing Xiu?”

Mei Li’s beautiful eyes widened, and then she shook her head.

“Now your soul has already surpassed the True Saint Realm. It’s normal for you to survive a battle with Xing Xiu. Fortunately, I’m not your enemy.”

She smiled bitterly and muttered to herself, then explained to Qin Yu after a while.

“The Tribulation Transcending cultivators fuse with the Path of Heaven and represent a part of the heaven. Therefore, the tribulation qi is also known as the heavenly might. You must have had some great opportunity that had caused your soul to break through, which is why the power of your soul carries the heavenly might.”

“Then what I’ve achieved shouldn’t be considered a true breakthrough, right? It’s similar to a half-step True Saint, just possessing a simulated tribulation might?”

Qin Yu felt a bit enlightened. His soul power had been in the ninth grade.

“That’s right. However, there are still cultivators from the previous Path of Heaven, or even more ancient, in this world. Xing Xiu, whom you met previously, is one of them. Their souls are the true tribulation might. However, the current Path of Heaven is only at the True Saint level, so their strength can only be controlled at the peak of the True Saint. Once the tribulation qi is leaked, they will suffer the backlash of the Path of Heaven.”

“My fake heavenly might identity doesn’t cause a backlash instead. Then wouldn’t I be close to being invincible in this galaxy?”

Qin Yu’s heart was beating fast. From Earth to the Holy Region, and to here…

This was the first time he stood at the peak. This feeling made him feel like he was living in a dream.

“You can say so. But of course, people like the evil exterminator and the masked woman, you’re still not their match even under the suppression of the cultivation realm, and they don’t use the tribulation might.

Mei Li explained to Qin Yu again.

“That’s normal. The evil exterminator’s power of the four Consummate Inner Strength Grandmaster Path of Heaven and the masked woman’s Nine Paths Convergence are indeed something that we can’t fight against right now.”

Qin Yu nodded. He was confident but not arrogant.

He had always felt that the masked woman would not die so easily. A person who had survived nine lifetimes would not die so easily.

Qin Yu’s thoughts kept spinning. A trace of his soul had already broken through to the ninth grade.

His comprehension of this realm had also deepened significantly.

True Saints harnessed the power of heaven and earth, while the Tribulation Transcending Stage involved becoming a part of heaven and earth. One’s divine thought could harness the power of heaven and earth. However, Qin Yu vaguely felt that becoming a part of heaven and earth and determining the strength of the Tribulation Transcending Stage depended on the accumulation at the True Saint Realm.

Moreover, perhaps there was more than one way to break through to the Tribulation Transcending Stage. Taking himself as an example, if he could compress the power of his soul infinitely, the power of heaven and earth ultimately used by the countless spirit beads could not be underestimated.

Cultivators like Wu Ji could also become the most powerful cultivator in the Degenerate Age.

Of course, Qin Yu’s comprehension was based on his current situation. Perhaps other people’s understanding was different.

“Qin Yu, I’m starving! Hurry up and get me something to eat.”

Suddenly, Jue Wu’s voice came from the Sumeru ring.

When Qin Yu entered the Sumeru ring, Jue Wu had already come out of closed-door cultivation.

“Have you broken through?”

He scanned Jue Wu with his divine sense and noticed that the spiritual energy in her body contained the power of rules. That was the power that could only be obtained after breaking through to the fifth-grade True Saint.

“Yeah! The breakthrough was somewhat inexplicable, but I feel I’ve become much stronger.”

Jue Wu clenched her fists and said in confusion.

She tried it out.

Jue Wu suddenly slapped her palm toward Qin Yu, and Qin Yu met it with his palm.

Qin Yu stepped five steps back in a row before he managed to get rid of the force.

“Again.”

Jue Wu’s body moved and arrived before Qin Yu.

She used her fists and legs, and Qin Yu used the Saintly Body Technique. However, being hit, his qi and blood fluctuated.

Within Jue Wu’s punches and kicks, there was a hidden fierce beast qi after breaking through. The power of each punch was enhanced.

In his divine sense, the fierce beast intent surged forth simultaneously.

It would definitely be a headache if it were an ordinary cultivator.

“Alright, stop. I haven’t tempered my body yet. I’ll fall apart again if this continues.”

With a divine thought, the giant hand formed by divine sense suddenly pressed down on Jue Wu.

“F*ck, Qin Yu, what move is this?”

Jue Wu’s desire to win suddenly rose, and she punched and kicked that giant hand.

“Stop! I’ll spank your buttock if you don’t stop!”

Qin Yu’s face darkened.

“Are you so great now that you want to spank me?”

Jue Wu was furious. Although she looked like a loli, she had lived five to six hundred years longer than Qin Yu.

Hearing Qin Yu say this, she naturally flew into a rage out of humiliation.

“Okay, okay, eat something first. I have a lot of six-tailed fox meat here. Do you want to eat?”

Qin Yu quickly said, afraid that Jue Wu would go crazy. The title “three lunatics, three extremes” was not for nothing.

After a familiar sequence of actions, the fragrant grilled meat was ready.

Several people in the Sumeru ring were attracted by the extreme fragrance. Even Elder Guai came up to eat wantonly. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Qin Yu, have you realized Jue Wu is running out of time?”

The man with the mustache suddenly sent a voice transmission.

Sigh.

Qin Yu nodded slightly. Dean Lei had already told him about the curse of the Nirvana Body in the Thunder Courtyard.
