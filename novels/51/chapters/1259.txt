Chapter 1260: Chapter 1,260, treacherous person 

Originally, Qin Yu had planned to rob him, but he didn’t expect this young man to be so enthusiastic. This made Qin Yu somewhat embarrassed.

He followed behind the young man and walked in a certain direction.

On the way, Qin Yu asked casually, “Is the Heavenly Cloud sect very powerful?”

The young man smiled and said, “Of course. It can be said that no one in the South Province is willing to offend them. Even the city lords of some small cities have to rely on the heavenly cloud sect to survive.”

Qin Yu rubbed his chin and continued to ask, “Then what kind of experts does the heavenly cloud sect have behind them?”

“I really don’t know much about this, but I know that there are quite a number of people at the peak of the mighty figure realm,”the youth continued.

Qin Yu nodded slightly.

This didn’t Surprise Qin Yu. After all, this was the holy region where experts were as numerous as the clouds.

“By the way, do you know the Yan Family?”Finally, Qin Yu couldn’t help but ask this question.

The young man asked as he walked, “Yan Family? You mean the Yan family in the Central Plains?”

Qin Yu hurriedly asked, “Central Plains? You mean the Yan family is in the Central Plains?”

The young man smiled and said, “If the Yan family that you mentioned is the Yan family that I understand, then it is in the Central Plains.”

“Not only the Yan family, the nine great aristocratic families are all in the Central Plains.”

Qin Yu immediately took a deep breath.

“Central Plains... looks like I have to go to the Central Plains,”Qin Yu muttered softly.

When the young man heard this, he couldn’t help but laugh. “Friend, do you know how far this place is from the Central Plains? Many people spend their entire lives unable to get even half a step closer to the Central Plains.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly as he waited for him to continue.

The young man continued, “Li Prefecture is at least several million stars away from the Central Plains. Even a mighty realm expert would find it difficult to travel by foot.”

“Furthermore... Li Prefecture is surrounded by the green rock forest. The entire Li Prefecture is surrounded by the green rock forest. Once you leave Li Prefecture, you won’t be able to see the edge of the Green Rock Forest.”

Qin Yu hurriedly asked, “What is this Green Rock Forest?”

The youth said with slight surprise, “You don’t even know about the Green Rock Forest?”

At this point, the youth took out a map.

This map was much more detailed than the one Qin Yu had snatched.

From the map, it seemed that the surroundings of Li Prefecture were indeed an extremely vast mountain forest.

And this mountain forest was the green rock forest.

If one wanted to reach the central prefecture, they would have to pass through the extremely vast green rock forest.

“There are extremely powerful demonic beasts in the Green Rock Forest, and many tribes are stationed there. There are many dangers, and who knows how many mighty realm experts have died in the Green Rock Forest,”the young man explained.

“If you want to pass through the Green Rock Forest, it’s as difficult as ascending to the heavens.”

Qin Yu gently stroked his chin and said in a low voice, “Then is there no way to reach the Central Plains?”

“Of course there is. In addition, there are many ways.”The youth said with a faint smile.

“For example, if you have sufficient strength, or if you have a battleship, or if you have a teleportation formation, all of these can lead you to the Central Plains.”

Qin Yu wanted to ask more questions, but at this time, the young man stopped in his tracks and said with a smile, “We’re here.”

Raising his head, he saw a manor that was neither big nor small in front of Qin Yu.

Qin Yu sniffed. In this manor, he seemed to be able to smell a faint scent of blood.

“Don’t worry. I’ve received quite a few friends here who are suffering and injured, so it’s hard to avoid the smell. I hope brother won’t mind.”The young man cupped his hands and said.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “It’s good enough to have a place to go. I naturally don’t mind.”

He followed the young man into the mansion. The mansion wasn’t big, but it had all the internal organs.

“Brother, you stay here for a while. I’ll make some arrangements.”The young man cupped his hands and said.

Qin Yu hurriedly pulled the young man and said, “By the way, do you know where there’s anger?”

“Anger?”The young man was slightly surprised.

“Yes, it’s the anger that corresponds to the Twilight Qi,”Qin Yu explained.

The young man touched his chin and said, “This kind of thing is not common. I’m afraid I can’t help. Perhaps those big aristocratic families and sects have it.”

Qin Yu nodded and didn’t ask any more questions.

“Give me your map?”At this time, Qin Yu suddenly said.

The young man smiled. “Of course.”

He immediately threw the map to Qin Yu, then said, “These two are my personal guards. If you need anything, you can look for them.”

“Okay.”Qin Yu nodded and agreed.

After the young man left, Qin Yu opened the map.

From the map, it seemed that the holy region was much bigger than he had imagined.

If the size of a star was equivalent to a kilometer, then this saint-level region would probably be several hundred times the size of Earth.

Just this small Li Prefecture alone was much larger than Earth.

Li Prefecture was relatively more remote, and the most prosperous one was naturally the central prefecture.

It was the most vast, and also the place with the most abundant resources.

The various great clans were all stationed there.

I have to think of a way to get to the Central Plains, Qin Yu thought to himself.

Right now, the most important thing for Qin Yu was to find his vitality as soon as possible and recover his spiritual power.

Just like what elder Bai said, without spiritual power, many spells could not be used. This was undoubtedly his fatal weakness. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qin Yu sat on the bed, and his mind could not help but start to run wild.

“I wonder how Chang Mang and the others are doing now,”Qin Yu muttered softly.

Just as Qin Yu was running wild with wild thoughts, a few colorful lights suddenly flashed around the mansion. Although it was fleeting, it still caught Qin Yu’s attention.

He sat up from the bed, his brows slightly furrowed, as if he was thinking about something.

“Not good!”

Qin Yu thought to himself that something was wrong, and turned around to leave.

But at this moment, a cry sounded from outside the door.

Then, he saw someone riding an auspicious-colored beast in the sky and arriving here.

It was a man wearing armor that looked like a general. His entire body was wrapped in silver-colored ice-cold armor, only revealing a pair of vulture-like eyes.

Behind him, there was still a large group of people, each of them full of fighting spirit.

“People from the Heavenly Cloud Sect.”Qin Yu immediately frowned.

After that, that young man also appeared beside them.

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu’s expression instantly turned cold.

“You Lied to me?”Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly and said coldly.

That young man laughed loudly and said, “Don’t you think that I would offend the Heavenly Cloud sect for the sake of an unknown kid? Don’t blame others, if you want to blame someone, blame yourself!”
