This feeling made Qin Yu feel extremely uneasy. That powerful oppressive feeling was extremely similar to the feeling brought by the mysterious person in the four symbols technique!

Standing at the entrance of the Dragon Burial Cave, the pitch-black cave entrance seemed to exude an ice-cold chill. One could not see the end of it.

Zhuo Jing looked at Qin Yu and said, “Shall we enter directly?”

“No.”Qin Yu immediately shook his head.

He took a deep breath and said: “I have a strong feeling that if we walk into this dragon burial cave, we will definitely die.”

Even though Qin Yu had a peerless body, there were still many ways to kill him in this world.

For example, once the divine sense was destroyed, there would be nothing left. Having a body would be useless.

Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly, and a pocket-sized golden light flew out from between his brows.

This light scattered in Qin Yu’s palm, looking rather mysterious.

And the moment this light flew out, Qin Yu’s spirit seemed to have become much more dispirited.

“This is... a strand of divine sense?”Zhuo Jing exclaimed.

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude and said, “Use this strand of divine sense to go in and scout the way.”

After saying that, Qin Yu stretched out his palm and slightly closed his eyes, as if he was controlling this strand of divine sense.

The strand of divine sense slowly entered the dragon burial cave, becoming the only light in the darkness.

Qin Yu relied on this strand of divine sense to sense everything in the dragon burial cave.

The deeper he went, the more intense the oppressive feeling became.

It was not an exaggeration to say that under this powerful oppressive feeling, Qin Yu’s strand of divine sense had difficulty walking!

This was because of the feeling of fear in his heart. Even walking was extremely difficult.

Qin Yu’s main body was sweating profusely, looking somewhat painful.

A few minutes later, Qin Yu’s eyes suddenly opened!

“How is it?”Zhuo Jing hurriedly asked from the side.

Qin Yu panted heavily, not saying a word.

Zhuo Jing didn’t dare to say anything. He could only wait quietly by the side.

After a long time, Qin Yu looked at Zhuo Jing with a serious face.

“How is it?”Zhuo Jing asked.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “The dragon burial cave... I’m afraid it’s not a legend.”

“What do you mean?”Zhuo Jing frowned.

Qin Yu said with a cold face, “The dragon burial cave is pitch-black. The moment I stepped into it, it was like walking into a river of corpses. It was as if there were countless corpses in the dragon burial cave.”

“When my divine sense went deeper, it became extremely difficult. I tried my best and finally saw a corner of the dragon burial cave.”

Zhuo Jing looked at Qin Yu anxiously, as if he was a little nervous.

“It’s... a dragon corpse? !”Zhuo Jing said with a trembling voice.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and nodded. “That’s right. It’s really a dragon corpse...”

“The legend... is actually true.”Zhuo Jing gasped, feeling a chill on his back.

“When I tried to go deeper, a terrifying internal Qi directly erased this strand of my divine sense. I didn’t even have the time to see clearly what it was. I only felt my vision go black and I lost all consciousness,”Qin Yu continued.

“In that case, the dragon burial cave is even more terrifying than I imagined...”Zhuo Jing said with difficulty.

Qin Yu didn’t deny it. He had no doubt that if it had been his real body, he would have become a corpse.

“In that case, let’s go. I believe that someone will come to explore the dragon burial cave sooner or later. We can still make it by then,”Zhuo Jing said.

He grabbed Qin Yu’s arm and turned around, intending to leave the east barren.

However, Qin Yu stood there without moving at all. No one knew what he was thinking about.

“You... Don’t tell me you still want to go in?”Zhuo Jing seemed to have seen through Qin Yu’s intention.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “It’s not easy for me to come here, but I’m really unwilling to leave just like that.”

“I know you’re very interested in the dragon corpse. It’s not just you. I think everyone in the world is interested in it,”Zhuo Jing said coldly.

“But no matter what kind of treasure it is, you must at least ensure its safety. Otherwise, wouldn’t it be a waste of your life?”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything, as if he was in a dilemma.

Zhuo Jing continued, “Qin Yu, all these things show that what that mysterious person said is right. Xiao Sheng is very likely to want to kill you!”

“Perhaps he has already figured out your personality, so he deliberately lured you to the Dragon Burial Cave!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Are you really going to fall for his trick?”

Qin Yu still didn’t say anything. From time to time, he raised his head to look at the Dragon Burial Cave, his eyes full of reluctance.

“Since we’re already here, we’re not in a hurry to go back even if we don’t enter the Dragon Burial Cave,”Qin Yu said to Zhuo Jing.

“How about... We stay here for a few days?”Qin Yu said with a smile.

A trace of helplessness flashed across Zhuo Jing’s face.

He patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “Don’t tell me you still want to go in?”

Qin Yu grunted and said, “I do want to go in, but... even if we don’t go in, we can go to other places in the east barren. This east barren is so big, how can there only be one dragon burial cave?”

Zhuo jing sighed and said, “But I always feel that the longer we stay here, the more unsafe it will be. Thinking of what the passerby said, I feel more and more uneasy.”

“Nothing will happen,”Qin Yu said with a smile.

Seeing this, Zhuo Jing had no choice but to agree.

But he was very clear in his heart that the reason why Qin Yu didn’t want to leave was clearly because he wanted to go into the dragon burial cave.

“Sigh.”Zhuo Jing let out a long sigh.

...

South Province.

During this period of time, many small cities and small villages had disappeared overnight.

And the state of their deaths was very similar to the methods of the northern lands.

Although it wasn’t a large-scale operation, it was obvious and made people feel uneasy.

Cultivation Mountain.

During this period of time, the Heavenly Cloud sect had recovered its former popularity, and everyone seemed to have returned to their normal lives.

On the Cultivation Mountain, the sect master was standing at the edge of the mountain and looking into the distance.

At this moment, the void in front of him trembled. After which, a door suddenly opened in the void. A man walked out in a short while.

Xiao Sheng did not seem to be surprised by this scene.

His eyes were looking into the distance as though he did not see him.

“You really sent Qin Yu to the East Continent,”the mysterious man said at this moment.

“Yes,”Xiao Sheng answered concisely.

“Phew... the east continent. It’s not much different from sending him to his death,”the man said.

Xiao Sheng glanced at him and said, “Really? I don’t think so.”

“Xiao Sheng, what are your intentions? After so many years, very few people can walk out of the East Continent,”the mysterious man’s tone suddenly became cold.

“Why did you make the decision to let him go to the Eastern Wilderness?”

A trace of coldness appeared in Xiao Sheng’s long and narrow eyes.

“Make the decision? You seem to have made a mistake. I, Xiao Sheng, have never listened to anyone.”Xiao Sheng said coldly.
