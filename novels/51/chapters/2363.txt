2364 Burning, the Land of Illusion

The weed regained its vitality again. It was the internal qi of the spiritual essence of life.

Qin Yu’s body ignited with high temperature again, and the cycle repeated.

Qin Yu repeated over a thousand times. His desolate divine eye stared at this space, observing all movements.

The fluctuation of space, the surging of rules, and even the quivering and curling of the tiny blades of grass, all the information surged into his sea of consciousness like a tidal wave.

He needed to confirm one thing now. His next operation would be tremendously dangerous if he failed to confirm it.

Finally, after tens of thousands of movements, he noticed something different.

In the space of that mystic realm, after the weeds were burned, the water vapor emitted fused with the spatial fluctuations.

There was a slight difference from the outside world that was hard to detect. One would not have detected it if not for the desolate divine eye

Qin Yu glanced at the people in the Sumeru ring and noticed that everyone’s power of divine sense was getting weaker.

With a determined look in his eyes, he stepped into the place of the coordinates.

The fire of divine sense suddenly began to burn in his sea of consciousness, and the power of divine sense several dozen times stronger than before erupted in his sea of consciousness.

It was something that one would only use when one was risking his life.

Under the burning of that divine fire, a terrifying power of divine sense exploded. The terrifying power of divine sense caused the surrounding space to distort suddenly. Countless spatial vortexes suddenly surrounded the Azure Ridge Continent, and hundreds of spatial overlapping shadows instantly appeared in the space of the Azure Ridge Continent.

Qin Yu’s face revealed a look of pain. The tenfold increase in the power of divine sense caused his sea of consciousness to feel immense pain as if it were about to collapse.

A vast amount of power of divine sense surged into his desolate divine eye like a tidal wave. In an instant, the world in front of him changed again. The lines of the rules of the world changed again in front of him.

As if magnifying thousands of times, the lines of the rules drew infinitely closer to Qin Yu’s eyes, transforming into one most origin symbol after another.

However, this burning of the power of the soul only lasted for dozens of seconds.

Qin Yu’s consciousness dimmed, which was a sign that his soul had completely dissipated.

“Ruoxue.”

His feet trembled slightly. In this life-and-death situation, he would completely disappear from this world if he made a single wrong judgment,

Darkness slowly covered Qin Yu’s eyes.

He did not know how long he had closed his eyes.

When he opened his eyes, he appeared in a world that was so beautiful that it made people suffocate. In that world, birds were singing, and flowers were fragrant.

Below, a sea of clouds flowed, while above, the sky was clear with white clouds. With each breath, there was nothing but the fragrance of flowers in the air. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

In the distance, two people snuggling together.

The man was refined and handsome, while the woman was simple and elegant.

The moment Qin Yu had just appeared, the scholar had already appeared before him.

His refined face revealed a furious expression.

The world around Qin Yu slowly collapsed, and the terrifying power of heaven and earth directly drowned him.

In the next moment, he appeared in another world.

He had completely lost his memories. In that world, he met a little girl. They slowly grew up, but the girl chose someone else in the end.

In another place, it was also these two people. Just as they were about to get married, Yan Ruoxue suddenly died of a severe illness…

One lifetime, two lifetimes, ten lifetimes, a hundred lifetimes, and a thousand…

When Qin Yu returned to the collapsed world, he was trembling and curled into a ball.

After a slight movement, he started to vomit frantically.

The painful memories of his previous life overlapped with each other. That almost realistic life experience almost made him collapse.

If it weren’t for the fact that his divine sense had experienced the same extreme physical pain, he would have collapsed long ago and become a fool.

The scholar seemed to be somewhat surprised. He did not expect Qin Yu to survive.

Qin Yu struggled to stand up. He fell dozens of times before he half-knelt to support his body.

After a long time, he regained some strength and slowly stood up.

That scholar did not move either, only staring coldly at Qin Yu.

There was only the indifference of seeing through life and death in his expression.

“You knew all this while that this place is fake. You chose to be a coward here. My appearance is to tell you this, so you’re angry, right?”

Qin Yu forced a smile with difficulty.

The coldness on the scholar’s face was slowly replaced by endless killing intent. Qin Yu only felt that his soul had suffered endless torture. The pain was dozens of times more painful than when he compressed the bead of spiritual sense.

His body trembled uncontrollably, but Qin Yu continued speaking with difficulty, “A fake is a fake, even if it’s exactly the same. You can’t create her smile every day, nor can you make an emotional reaction for her. She will feel sad, she will also choose to die for you, she will choose to wait for you silently somewhere in the world, and she will give up everything for you. Can you create that?”

Qin Yu shouted madly in the end, like a madman.

He did not know if he was talking about the scholar or himself.

When he finished speaking, he could no longer resist his longing for Yan Ruoxue. He fell to the ground and cried madly, not caring how unpleasant his voice was.

The killing intent on the scholar’s face slowly disappeared, and his eyes gradually turned red.

The scholar raised his head, his face revealing the relief of making a decision.

He had been here for a long time and really could not bear to leave.

We built that house together, and the marks that the children drew were the same.

The marks of the sun and rain on the shed were exactly the same.

However, time passed by, Qian’er.

“I will continue to move forward, and when the time comes, I will definitely reunite your soul with utmost care so that you can be reunited with me in this world.”

The world was ablaze, and everything in its path collapsed.

When everything was burned clean, Qin Yu suddenly realized that he had returned to where he was.

The scholar was long gone, but he seemed to hear the words “thank you”.

Qin Yu took a while to recover. He quickly sent his divine sense into the Sumeru ring.

At this moment, Chang Mang, Xi Menn’s sister, the little girl, and the people controlled by the Holy Region had all woken up.

“Brother, you’re awake!”

The moment Chang Mang saw Qin Yu, his face was full of ecstasy.

Qin Yu hugged him tightly. The first time the two met, Chang Mang did not hesitate to help Qin Yu.

In the Holy Region, he was captured by the Si family, thrown into the Skywater Prison, and tortured there.

“I’m sorry, Brother.”

“F*ck, you’re telling me this. I’ve already told those b*stards from the Si family that as long as they don’t kill me, I’ll definitely go back and beat up everyone in the Si family. Are you interested, Brother?”

Chang Mang grinned.

“Great! This sh*t family actually wants to snatch your sister-in-law. I think this family should collapse!”

Qin Yu was also affected by Chang Mang’s emotions, and he did not feel as sad as earlier.
