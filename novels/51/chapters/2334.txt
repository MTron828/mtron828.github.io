2335 Little Fire, Don’t Be Afraid

The reason why the Teng family could stay was naturally because of heaven’s chosen son, Teng Zixu. At this moment, Teng Zixu’s power had grown so fast that it had even intimidated the nine great aristocratic families.

Once the prosperous era of the Path of Heaven descended, he would soar to the skies. With such strength, naturally, it was necessary to treat the Teng family as a partner.

“Our nine great aristocratic families and the Teng family have important missions for our trip to purgatory this time, so let’s clarify it all here.”

The head of the Yao family smiled as he spoke, seemingly showing no sense of urgency.

“This time, our nine great aristocratic families and the Teng family will naturally control all the cultivators in purgatory. Our ten families will be the leaders. If the alien races attack the human race, we will just let them block in front.”

“I heard there are many powerful cultivators in the purgatory galaxy. What if they resist?” The head of the Teng family somewhat had doubts.

“Kill them to warn the others. The elders of the Si family, Si Qianjing, Si Yu; the holy son of the Yao family, Yao Xi; the three Supreme Elders of the Ni family; as well as the elders and disciples of the other aristocratic families will go over. They will also bring their family treasures. They can suppress anyone regardless of who they are.”

Si Wujue said. Several aristocratic families had already communicated with each other earlier.

“I’ll go together. I heard someone in purgatory has also deeply comprehended the Path of heaven. I’m interested.”

Teng Zixu said with a smile.

“Zixu, purgatory will be the first to bear the brunt of the three races’ joint attack. It’s better to plan first or let the five elders go with you.”

Teng Tian furrowed his brows and was somewhat worried.

“It’s fine. No one can stop me as long as the Path of Heaven’s suppression still presents.”

Teng Zixu chuckled, full of confidence.

Many of the Holy Sons of the aristocratic families in the main hall were somewhat unhappy, but no one said anything.

Heaven’s chosen son was born following the Path of Heaven. Indeed, at present, no one could challenge him.

“One more thing. What if the Path of Heaven changes? Looking at the current situation, once the Path of Heaven changes, it will be a true golden age, and the suppression of the Path of Heaven will no longer exist. When the time comes, once the Tribulation Transcending cultivators from purgatory counterattack, it will be a huge threat to our forces.”

Teng Tian asked again. He had already placed the Teng family on the same level as the nine great aristocratic families. He would ask them directly if he had any questions.

“We will send two Supreme Elders from the previous Path of Heaven year. The moment the Path of Heaven changes, everything will be under our aristocratic families’ control.”

Si Wujue frowned slightly. He was a little annoyed by Teng Tian’s constant questioning.

After many people dispersed, a few families stayed in the main hall.

Si Wujue said in a deep voice.

“There’s no need to fight him one-on-one. He has too many treasures. He has the Suo Lin Divine Artifact, the coffin of the masked woman of nine lifetimes. I heard he also has a pair of top-grade divine boots. This kid has many secrets on him. We must take him down in one fell swoop and slowly refine these memories!”

Si Wujue patted Yao Xi.

“Sir, you don’t have to worry. I will see Shiyue’s situation that time and decide whether to go to purgatory with him,” Si Liuhe said calmly as if he did not take Qin Yu seriously in the slightest.

…

In Solitary Cloud City, ten days or so had passed, and Qin Yu’s condition was deteriorating.

Under the scorching flames of the Vermilion Bird, the remaining breath was now beginning to assault Qin Yu’s soul.

What terrified Qin Yu the most was that these flames of the Vermillion Bird seemed to have consciousness.

There was a faint remaining breath of the Vermillion Bird hidden deep within his soul, but it had never attacked his divine sense. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

It was only waiting for Qin Yu’s remaining breath to be defeated before it suddenly erupted.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s soul could not even leave his body.

“Master, do you need me to spare his life?”

The Vermilion Bird that followed behind Immortal Crane bowed and asked.

Immortal Crane paused for a moment and shook his head.

“Little Fire! Little Fire! Come out quickly, don’t be afraid! I’ll die if you don’t come out soon!”

Qin Yu was completely at his wit’s end at this moment. Being able to hold on for these ten days or so was his limit.

He had been communicating with Suo Lin for ten days or so but noticed that Suo Lin dared not appear on his body this time, which was rare.

He seemed to have a deep-seated fear of the absolute king of fire that was carved into his soul. Suo Lin, constructed using the inner core of the fire unicorn, did not listen to Qin Yu’s command for the first time.

Furthermore, as Qin Yu’s divine sense grew weaker, the connection between him and Suo Lin also grew weaker.

He could only rely on Suo Lin, this protective magical artifact, to block the remaining breath at this moment.

“No, I can’t drag this out any longer!”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. His power of divine sense no longer protected his origin.

He poured all his spiritual power into Suo Lin, trying to communicate with him again.

The Vermilion Bird’s remaining breath in his body suddenly burned his sea of consciousness. The intense pain made Qin Yu’s entire head twitch uncontrollably.

“Little Fire, don’t be afraid. It’s just a small flame of the Vermillion Bird. You’ll become even more powerful if you swallow it!”

Qin Yu urged Suo Lin to return to his sea of consciousness using his divine sense.

At the same time, he tried to appease the fear of the fire unicorn’s inner core.

Finally, at the very last moment before the flame of the Vermilion Bird burned Qin Yu’s divine sense, Suo Lin transformed into a robe and blocked before him.

“Boom!”

Wu Ji’s divine robe suddenly absorbed the flame, and then an endless sea of fire burned in Suo Lin, crazily refining the wisp of flame.

Even though the flame of the Vermilion Bird was of a higher grade, it was only a wisp.

Under the crazy refining of the fire unicorn’s inner core, this wisp of flame of the Vermillion Bird was slowly refined and fused into the fire unicorn’s inner core.

The flame fused with Suo Lin’s flame, and the entire divine artifact emitted stifling fluctuations.

The absorption of this flame caused the fire unicorn’s inner core to have a visible improvement.

Similar to the divine sense released by Qin Yu’s divine sense spirit bead, it was also the power of the soul, but the two had qualitative differences.

With the integration of this wisp of remaining breath, Qin Yu felt that the power of his Fire Fist had increased by at least 20%!

In the depths of the ninth level of purgatory, the Vermilion Bird’s body trembled, and anger showed on its face.

“Hahaha, he won’t die so easily. Let’s go. I’ll compensate you a hundredfold for this wisp of Vermilion Bird flame.”

Immortal Crane laughed as if he had expected this.

Qin Yu could finally breathe a sigh of relief after finally dealing with the flame of the Vermilion Bird.

Crackling sounds came from his body, and his skeleton suddenly turned into dust and fell to the ground.
