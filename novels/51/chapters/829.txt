Chapter 830: The Unforeseen Event of the Immortal Slaying Sect

This was the largest Golden Core Qin Yu had ever seen!

“As expected of a half-step Martial Saint. The Golden Core is actually so big.” Qin Yu licked his lips, his face filled with greed.

And this expression was undoubtedly like that of a demon to the dying Shen Yichun.

“Qin Yu, you...” Shen Yichun opened his mouth, his face filled with despair.

Qin Yu looked at Shen Yichun coldly and said, “Don’t worry. Sooner or later, I will completely eradicate the Hong Yi Sect.”

After saying this, Qin Yu raised his hand and slapped Shen Yichun to death.

After killing Shen Yichun, Qin Yu put away his Golden Core.

He couldn’t help but spit out a mouthful of blood.

Qin Yu was also injured in the fight just now.

He wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth. After thinking for a while, Qin Yu finally put away Shen Yichun’s corpse.

After returning to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, Qin Yu went straight to the Pavilion Master’s building.

This time, the Pavilion Master didn’t blame Qin Yu.

“What’s wrong with you?” Seeing Qin Yu’s appearane, the Pavilion Master couldn’t help but frown.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “It’s Shen Yichun from the Hong Yi Sect.”

“Shen Yichun?”

The Pavilion Master’s expression couldn’t help but change slightly.

“He has already been killed by me.” Qin Yu threw Shen Yichun’s body on the ground.

Seeing this scene, the Pavilion Master was even more shocked, but she quickly calmed down.

“I didn’t expect that the famous Shen Yichun would die at the hands of a junior.” The Pavilion Master couldn’t help but shake her head. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qin Yu didn’t continue this topic and instead asked, “Pavilion Master, how is Ruoxue?”

“Don’t worry, she’s fine. Her vital signs are very stable,” the Pavilion Master said.

“Where is she now? I want to see her,” Qin Yu said.

The Pavilion Master nodded slightly. “Follow me.”

Qin Yu followed behind the Pavilion Master and came all the way to the secret chamber.

In this secret chamber, Yan Ruoxue was still soaking in the medicinal bath.

The rich medicinal fragrance mixed with Yan Ruoxue’s body fragrance and emitted a unique fragrance.

Qin Yu walked to Yan Ruoxue and half-knelt in front of the medicinal pool. He said with a gentle expression, “During this period of time, have a good sleep. You should rest.”

After saying that, Qin Yu stood up and looked at the Pavilion Master. He bowed and said, “Pavilion Master, I’m afraid I’ll have to trouble you for this period of time. However, I think it won’t take that long.”

The Pavilion Master said in surprise, “What do you mean?”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “The news that Yan Ruoxue is here with you will be spread sooner or later. When that time comes, someone will definitely come after hearing the news.”

The Pavilion Master didn’t deny this.

“I know that you are powerful, but it’s hard to fight against them alone. No one knows what kind of forces they will deploy,” Qin Yu continued.

“So?” The Pavilion Master asked in puzzlement.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly and said, “I plan to find a Mystic Realm and hide Ruoxue there for the time being.”

“Mystic Realm?” This made the Pavilion Master somewhat surprised.

Even the powerful Divine Alchemist Pavilion didn’t have a Mystic Realm. It wasn’t so easy to find a Mystic Realm.

A trace of viciousness flashed in Qin Yu’s eyes.

He said coldly, “I know of a Mystic Realm in Qing City.”

If it weren’t for Shen Yichun’s arrival, Qin Yu would have almost forgotten about the Mystic Realm in Qing City.

Since they hadn’t given up their evil intentions, Qin Yu naturally wouldn’t let them go.

Although that Mystic Realm didn’t have much spiritual energy, it was a good choice for a hiding place.

“Your little girlfriend needs to have her medicine changed every day. If she changes places, I’m afraid it won’t be convenient,” the Pavilion Master said with a frown.

Upon hearing this, Qin Yu was immediately a little worried.

That’s right. Qin Yu didn’t have the time to take care of Yan Ruoxue all the time now.

“Let her stay here for now. No one knows for the time being,” said the Pavilion Master.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “That’s the only way.”

Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry to leave the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. Instead, he went to the dungeon and found Zheng Ke.

If he wanted to open the Mystic Realm of Qing City, he would definitely need Zheng Ke’s help.

After arriving at the dungeon, Qin Yu bent down and looked at Zheng Ke, who looked miserable.

“How is it? Haven’t you thought it through?” Qin Yu said with some amusement.

Zheng Ke glanced at Qin Yu coldly and sneered. “Qin Yu, you won’t get anything from me. Stop dreaming!”

Qin Yu wasn’t anxious. He smiled faintly and said, “Zheng Ke, I now understand why you are so stubborn. You think that the Hong Yi Sect will definitely come to save you, right?”

Zheng Ke snorted and didn’t say anything.

Qin Yu continued, “You are right. The Hong Yi Sect will definitely come to save you, and they are already here.”

Zheng Ke’s eyes immediately flashed with a glimmer of light.

“The position of the person who came isn’t low. It was actually elder Shen Yichun of the Hong Yi Sect. Tsk tsk, looks like you’re very important to them,” Qin Yu said.

Zheng Ke coldly said, “What exactly do you want to say?”

Qin Yu didn’t answer this question. With a thought, Shen Yichun’s corpse landed in front of Zheng Ke.

“He did come to save you, but unfortunately, he’s already dead,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Zheng Ke’s expression suddenly changed drastically!

He grabbed Shen Yichun’s corpse and looked left and right. A trace of despair appeared on his face.

To Zheng Ke, this was undoubtedly the destruction of hope!

“Shen Yichun is already dead. No one can come to save you,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“What you rely on no longer exists. But if you’re willing to tell me how to open the Mystic Realm, I might give you a chance to live,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Zheng Ke acted as if he didn’t hear him. He grabbed Shen Yichun’s corpse and didn’t speak for a long time.

Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry. He glanced at Zheng Ke and said, “Zheng Ke, I’ll only give you one last day to consider. If you’re still so stubborn tomorrow, I’ll send you on your way.”

“At the same time, I’ll tell you that if I can kill Shen Yichun, I can kill most of the people of the Hong Yi Sect.”

“I don’t believe that you are the only person in the Hong Yi Sect who knows how to open the Mystic Realm.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and walked out of the dungeon.

After leaving the dungeon, Qin Yu planned to spend the day with Yan Ruoxue.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s phone rang.

The caller was none other than the man with the mustache.

Qin Yu picked up the phone and said, “How is it? Has the formation been set up?”

The man with the mustache said, “The formation has been set up, but...”

“But what?” Qin Yu frowned.

The man with the mustache said in a deep voice, “But something happened to the Immortal Slaying Sect. It’s completely different from what we saw last time.”

“Something happened? What happened?” Qin Yu immediately frowned.
