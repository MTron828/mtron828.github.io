2518 The Number of Thrones

The loli from Divine Night Sect also said softly.

Revered Qi said indifferently.

“The path of the demonic cultivator is to abandon the path of the future and combine the spiritual and the physical, sealing the soul in the head. Although this kid did not place the soul imprint in the sea of the Path of Heaven, his cultivation path is closer to the masked woman’s, not He Teng’s.”

Su Xinghe shook his head.

The masked woman was Nine Paths Convergenceone and had broken through this constraint.

She had mastered the supreme secret of reincarnation of the ghost race reviving after eight cycles of reincarnation and death.

She had comprehended every Great Dao to the extreme and used the egg of the monster race to reincarnate. Many of the secrets remained unknown to the higher-ups of the human race. In any case, when she appeared last time, many humans felt a sense of danger.

“Forget it. Let’s watch the battle between the two.”

The loli of Divine Night Sect said somewhat helplessly.

“I should not have attacked you with the current condition of your body. However, before the great calamity of the human race, it’s better to break through as soon as possible…”

“I despise people like you the most. Make your move!”

Qin Yu said coldly.

At this moment, he no longer had any distracting thoughts. As a man, he had to do his best to defeat someone who coveted his fiancée.

As for what would happen later, it was not something he could control.

A hundred years ago, Si Shiyue established a hundred-year agreement with him with the demeanor of a gentleman.

However, he did not expect to be so disappointed after the arrival of the hundred-year agreement.

“I’ve given you enough time for the hundred-year agreement. The destiny between you and my chaotic body will be decided today.”

Si Shiyue stood up with a faint smile and stared at Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, let me tell you why I’m so stubborn about breaking through this level. This barrier is like the difference between heaven and earth. Even if there’s only a slight chance, I’ll give it my all and try! Your laughable thoughts can’t even withstand a single blow in the face of power.”

Si Shiyue took a step forward, and his body blurred.

“They’re not phantoms. Everyone here seems like an actual clone. The power of the Path of Heaven on each of them is tremendously powerful.”

“This is an ultimate clone of water. It has a tremendously strong vital energy of origin. This clone condensed is almost solid coupled with the flag of water!”

Jiang Qingyuan said softly.

As thousands of Shi Shiyue came to Qin Yu’s side, their internal qi surged like tides.

These figures either disappeared into the air or wandered on the ground. The ghostly figure closed the distance between both sides in the blink of an eye.

Dozens of Si Shiyue suddenly made their moves, and they attacked simultaneously.

Qin Yu frowned slightly, and his Spiritualization Technique suddenly propped up a defensive barrier.

This palm technique was tremendously fast, and there was no way to dodge it.

In an instant, countless frost flowers appeared on the defensive barrier that the Spiritualization Technique propped up.

The frost flowers seemed to have their own lives as they followed Qin Yu’s divine sense.

Frost Seal.

The phantom of an enormous ice throne slowly appeared, and a stream of power of origin suddenly poured into the consciousness of several clones.

In an instant, the land within a thousand meters turned into a world of ice and snow.

When this power froze, even the air seemed to be free of ice crystals.

“What a terrifying elemental power! With the help of the Five Elements Flag, this power is not much weaker than Gu Ning’s. Besides, Si Shiyue cultivates the five elements concurrently. Even if he uses water as the main power, he’s not weaker than others. Just look at Si Liuhe, and you’ll know.”

Lei Huan frowned and said. He felt this power alone was irresistible, not to mention Si Shiyue must have had a backup plan.

Vortex Strangle!

The five figures stood up. As their fingertips moved, an invisible force began to surge. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Their fingers gradually interweaved into a complex and ancient rune, and the power of the Path of Heaven between heaven and earth trembled again.

The world of ice and snow suddenly began to spin.

Amidst the cracking sound, this whole world suddenly began to tremble like a living thing. It was an ice dragon with clear and sharp features.

At this moment, it wrapped around Qin Yu.

While its body was trembling, a strange black tearing scene appeared. It was a spatial rift cut between its body and space.

A terrifying magical force pressed down and forced it open.

He frowned and lit up the soul in Evil Eye.

God-slaying Dusk!

Evil Eye stabbed into the ground, and a violent air current instantly swept out with him as the center.

The ice dragon, transformed from heaven and earth, turned into a mist filling the sky and suddenly dissipated.

“What a terrifying power! This power of origin has been tremendously powerful and only slightly weaker than Yan Ruoxue’s. The most terrifying thing is that Qin Yu couldn’t dodge it at all when Si Shiyue used the technique.”

Qin Yu’s looked somewhat solemn.

The massive force instantly pressed on his body, causing countless tiny wounds. His holy body had not recovered at this moment, and his combat strength had reduced too much.

What shocked him the most was that his three immensely powerful moves had only killed dozens of clones.

Rage of the Forest.

One of close to 1,000 clones formed a massive talisman in his palm.

The phantom of the throne appeared again, and an earthen-yellow Path of Heaven power smashed down again.

“What?”

Qin Yu was shocked. Two throne phantoms!

Everyone gasped. It was an identical enormous throne phantom.

It was almost on par with the Throne of Water previously, which was hair-raising to hear!

It was segregating a part of the origin for an ordinary person to leave behind a soul imprint.

However, Si Shiyue had already segregated two parts of the power of origin in a row. If he were not confident enough, he was crazy and stupid.

At this moment, the instant the power of the Path of Heaven poured down, the talisman flew into the sky, causing a violent energy fluctuation.

Numerous massive vines surged up like dragons. These vines covered the sky and earth, and one could not see the end of it at a glance.

The massive root seemed to be about to pierce into the clouds.

From afar, it looked like a green ocean surging.

“Slap! Slap!”

Almost in an instant, the vine lashed down like a whip.

The sound was so loud that even after hearing it, a sharp cry still filled one’s ears.

The space where Qin Yu was turned into a void completely as the vines danced wildly.

Even the formation set up by the alliance seemed unable to do anything to this berserk power.

Water-grown Wood.

The first attack seemed to be the foreshadowing of the second attack.

A large amount of blood suddenly seeped out of Qin Yu’s body. The combined power of the two was twice as strong as the first attack.

The Heart of the Ocean in his body emanated a dense power, and the injuries it surged through instantly healed.
