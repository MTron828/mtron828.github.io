1971 The Alchemist Association

Qin Yu was full of curiosity about the ninth-grade alchemist. The only person he could ask now was Master Yun.

When he arrived at Master Yun’s residence, Qin Yu knocked on the door carefully.

Soon, a voice came from inside, “Come in,”

Qin Yu pushed the door open and walked in quickly.

At this moment, Master Yun was walking back and forth in front of a medicine cabinet as if he was looking for something.

He was not curious about Qin Yu’s arrival and did not even look at him.

At the side, Qin Yu didn’t dare to say anything, so he just waited quietly.

A few minutes later, Master Yun took a medicine from the medicine cabinet and muttered, “I’ve finally found you,”

He put the medicine away, then looked at Qin Yu and said with a faint smile, “I knew you’d come to me.”

“Master Yun, I have a few questions for you,” Qin Yu couldn’t wait to ask.

“Don’t be anxious. I also have a few questions to ask you,” Master Yun said.

“A few days ago, you might have had some unspeakable secrets in front of everyone. Now, you should tell me what grade of alchemist you are,” Master Yun said indifferently.

Qin Yu was silent for a while, then said, “What I said a few days ago is all true. I don’t know what grade of alchemist I am. I don’t even know where this grade comes from.”

Master Yun frowned slightly. He sized Qin Yu up and didn’t think he was lying.

“You should have a spiritual fire, right?” Master Yun asked.

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. Then he flipped his palm and a purple flame suddenly jumped in his palm. However, the flame was extremely unstable, which showed he had poor control.

A look of shock flashed across Master Yun’s face. He murmured, “It’s a purple spiritual fire, but his control is so bad. It shouldn’t be…”

“Not long ago, I was severely injured in the battle with Si Shifeng. Thus my control of the flames became extremely unstable,” Qin Yu quickly explained.

“I see.” Master Yun finally understood. “You have a purple spiritual fire. The Alchemist Association will definitely give you a grade.”

“Alchemist Association…” Qin Yu muttered the name.

This was the second time he had heard of this organization. The Pavilion Master was in the Alchemist Association.

She was extremely talented, and her cultivation was also terrifyingly powerful. She must have an extremely high status in the Alchemist Association.

“Master Yun, what are the conditions for me to join the Alchemist association?” Qin Yu asked.

“With this purple spiritual fire, you don’t need to meet any requirements to become a first-grade alchemist,” Master Yun said, waving his hand.

“Then what if I want to see a ninth-grade alchemist?” Qin Yu asked tentatively.

Hearing this, Master Yun couldn’t help but burst into laughter. “Ninth-grade? Do you know how many ninth-grade there are in the entire Holy Region?”

Qin Yu shook his head, indicating he had no idea.

Master Yun stuck out his fingers and said, “Only three! Three ninth-grade alchemists! The rarity of a ninth-grade alchemist is no less than te Tribulation Stage great cultivator!”

Qin Yu gasped, and a look of worry flashed across his face.

In the current era, there was not even a Tribulation Stage great cultivator. However, a ninth-grade alchemist could be compared with a Tribulation Stage great cultivator. It was enough to show how terrifying they were!

“In that case, a ninth-grade alchemist is of the highest grade,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“No,” Master Yun shook his head and said. “The highest grade is tenth-grade.”

“There’s a tenth-grade alchemist?” Qin Yu got up quickly.

Master Yun snorted and said, “The prerequisite to becoming a tenth-grade alchemist is to enter the Tribulation Transcending Stage. There isn’t one in the entire Holy Region!”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but smile bitterly.

Wasn’t this a little too f*cking harsh?

“That’s why I can’t see a ninth-grade alchemist at all,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Master Yun shook his head and said, “No, it’s not that you can’t see a ninth-grade alchemist. You don’t even have the right to see a seventh-grade alchemist! If it wasn’t for the Prince of the Great Xia, you couldn’t even see me.”

“Is the status of alchemist so high?” Qin Yu was confused.

“Of course. The effect brought by a top-notch pill can be said to be twice the result with half the effort. Some even require the assistance of pills when they break through,” Master Yun said.

Then Master Yun looked at Qin Yu’s palm and said, “Speaking of which, you should go to the Alchemist Association to further your studies.”

Qin Yu had the same thought, but he did not have the time to do that.

The day of the Path of Heaven would arrive at any moment. Qin Yu had to devote all his energy to cultivation to raise his cultivation level. At the very least, he had to catch up to Si Shifeng.

“I will definitely go if I have the chance in the future,” Qin Yu said.

Master Yun shook his head and said, “You still don’t know what an alchemist means. It’s a pass to the entire Holy Region. Many people are trying to get in, but you’re trying to delay it time and time again.”

“I have no choice.” Qin Yu laughed bitterly. “I really don’t have the time now.”

But speaking of which, Qin Yu had an additional path now.

If he really couldn’t survive, going to the Alchemist Association wasn’t a bad choice.

“By the way, Master Yun, can I ask you to help me refine a pill?” Qin Yu asked tentatively.

Master Yun laughed heartily. “You wish! The price of my alchemy is extremely high. I won’t sell it easily. Furthermore, you will have to provide all the medicinal ingredients yourself.”

Qin Yu thought for a while and agreed with him.

But if he had enough materials, Qin Yu would not need Master Yun’s help.

After returning to his accommodation, Qin Yu could not help but sigh.

He looked at Yao Meng’s room and muttered, “I’m sorry. I’m afraid I can’t help you now.”

...

That night, Qin Yu did not sleep. It seemed that he had encountered a bottleneck in his cultivation. No matter what he did, he could not make any progress. Even his ability to capture spiritual energy had become less sensitive.

Qin Yu had no one to guide him, so he was like a headless fly.

The higher one’s cultivation was, the more difficult it would be to cultivate. It was obviously not a good choice to rely on absorbing the spiritual energy of the Holy Region.

“Master Yun, you’ve reminded me of something,” Qin Yu thought to himself. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Since the process of cultivation required the assistance of medicinal pills, perhaps alchemy was the best choice now.

Therefore, that night, Qin Yu searched for a few formulas in his mind and planned to try his luck in a few days.

“I have dragon blood and dragon meat in my hands. I only need a few ordinary herbs to make a good pill,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

The following day, just as Qin Yu was about to go to the medicine market to try his luck, the attendant of the Prince of Great Xia appeared at the entrance.

He slightly bowed to Qin Yu and said, “Mr. Qin, Your HIghness has invited you to the Great Hall for a chat.”

“Your Highness is inviting me?” Qin Yu frowned slightly. “My friend, why is Your Highness looking for me?”

“The people from the Si family have arrived,” the attendant said in a low voice.
