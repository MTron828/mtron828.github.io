After Yan Jinyao left, the others also surrounded him. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Qin Yu, you’re really bold!” Zhuang Teng cupped his hands and said.

Chu Heng, who was at the side, also hurriedly walked forward and sighed. “Qin Yu, you really make us admire you. Yan Jinyao and Blackie are both famous existences now.”

Qin Yu glanced at these two people and smiled. “If I was afraid of them, I wouldn’t have come here.”

“That being said, Qin Yu, you still have to be careful.” The others also walked forward and said.

Qin Yu nodded and turned around to leave.

At this time, Yao Meng suddenly walked forward and said in a low voice, “Qin Yu, do you know Blackie’s background? He doesn’t seem simple.”

Qin Yu snorted and said, “His original body is a Heaven Swallowing Python. He has just consumed a body transformation pill.”

“Heaven Swallowing Python?” Yao Meng covered her mouth and whispered.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “That’s right.”

“No wonder he has such combat strength.” Yao Meng was a little surprised.

“It is said that Granny Qin treats him like her own son. She will definitely try her best to help Blackie improve his strength in this month. Qin Yu, you must be careful.” Yao Meng warned.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Blackie is already at the peak of the Martial Marquis realm. I don’t believe that he can still become a Martial Saint in this month.”

As long as he wasn’t a Martial Saint, Qin Yu was confident.

“That’s true.” Yao Meng nodded slightly.

After a while, Chu Hedao also walked over.

He walked directly to Qin Yu and said in a deep voice, “It seems that you don’t plan to participate in the trip to the Mystic Realm in half a month’s time.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “Let’s talk about it next time.”

Chu Hedao nodded. He stood in front of Qin Yu for a long time, as if he had something to say.

“Just say what you want to say,” said Qin Yu.

Chu Hedao said in a deep voice, “I do have something I want to ask you for help with, but I don’t think you have time for it at the moment.”

“You want my help?” Qin Yu was a little surprised.

Chu Hedao nodded and said, “That’s right. Let’s talk about it in a month.”

Then, Chu Hedao walked away.

Qin Yu looked at Chu Hedao’s back and was surprised to find that Chu Hedao had already entered the middle stage of the Martial Marquis Realm.

Such speed was really amazing.

Compared to Chu Heng, Chu Hedao was obviously more talented.

Not only that, but his treatment of people was also fundamentally different from Chu Heng’s.

“Although they are both wealthy aristocratic families, if I can build a good relationship with the Chu family, it would be good for me,” Qin Yu thought inside.

Of course, this was probably just Qin Yu’s wishful thinking.

After sending the people away, Qin Yu also planned to leave.

The man with the mustache followed behind Qin Yu and said with a smile, “Do you have a plan?”

Qin Yu glanced at the man with the mustache and rolled his eyes. “What plan can I have?”

The man with the mustache sneered. “If you don’t have a plan, how dare you publicly challenge the Heaven Swallowing Python and Yan Jinyao? And even sign the Heavenly Guardian Book?”

“Tell me quickly, have you found some treasure?”

Qin Yu pulled the man with the mustache to the side and said mysteriously, “If you can tell me how to open the Mystic Realm, I will tell you.”

The man with the mustache waved his hand and said, “It’s impossible to open the Mystic Realm, unless it’s an ownerless Mystic Realm.”

“Like the Mystic Realms controlled by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, they all have their own unique methods.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

The man with the mustache was right.

This Mystic Realm was like a person’s home, and the master naturally had the key to open the door.

“Then do you know how to open the ownerless Mystic Realm?” Qin Yu looked at the man with the mustache.

The man with the mustache shook his head and said, “I don’t know, but I can think of something.”

At this point, the man with the mustache glanced at Qin Yu and said, “There are almost no ownerless Mystic Realms now. Even if there are, it’s not something you can find.”

“Not necessarily,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

The man with the mustache wanted to say something, but Qin Yu waved at him and said, “Okay, I won’t tell you anymore. Thank you for your help this time. I will remember this favor.”

After saying this, Qin Yu left.

The man with the mustache looked at Qin Yu’s back and whispered, “This guy definitely found some treasure. I have to follow him to take a look.”

Thus, the man with the mustache followed Qin Yu and chased after him.

Qin Yu couldn’t do anything to him, so he could only bring him along.

...

On the same day, Qin Yu, Chang Mang, and the man with the mustache left the martial arts academy and returned to the Green Moon Villa.

“By the way, do you have a way to enter the Immortal Slaying Sect?” Qin Yu asked the man with the mustache.

The man with the mustache replied, “I do have a way, but it will take some time.”

“How long?” Qin Yu asked.

The man with the mustache counted with his fingers and said, “One week.”

“No, it’s too slow.” Qin Yu frowned.

“Can it be done in three days?”

The man with the mustache glared at Qin Yu and said, “Three days? You think too highly of me!”

“Work harder and try to finish it in three days.” Qin Yu patted the shoulder of the man with the mustache.

Qin Yu planned to take Xiao Yu to the Immortal Slaying Sect to see if he could find anything.

Besides that, Qin Yu’s goal was the ten-thousand-year-old herbs.

As long as he got the ten-thousand-year-old herbs, Qin Yu could go into seclusion to fight the Heaven Swallowing Python.

...

For the next few days, Qin Yu stayed in his room and didn’t come out.

He closed his eyes and felt the mark between his eyebrows.

This was left by Granny Qin. Her purpose was to lock onto Qin Yu’s position.

Qin Yu naturally couldn’t accept it. If he didn’t get rid of this mark, all his actions would be exposed.

Qin Yu closed his eyes He once again used the divine judgment to forcibly erase this mark.

The moment the divine judgment fell, that mark suddenly flickered and shone.

In the next second, a shadow actually flew out from between Qin Yu’s brows!

This shadow was none other than Granny Qin!

She looked coldly at Qin Yu, narrowed her eyes and said, “Little b*stard, you have quite a few tricks.”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “So it turns out that it wasn’t a mark, but a wisp of spiritual sense.”

“So what if it is? I’m telling you, don’t even think about escaping!” Granny Qin said sinisterly.

Qin Yu wasn’t in the mood to talk nonsense with her. He immediately waved his big hand and directly crushed this phantom into pieces.

In a certain room in the martial arts academy, Granny Qin suddenly opened her eyes.

“This little b*stard actually erased this trace of spiritual sense...” Granny Qin said in a low voice.

She sat there for a long time before she snorted. “Anyway, the heavenly guardian book has been signed. He can’t escape!”
