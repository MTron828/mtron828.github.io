Chapter 1366: Chapter 1,366, full of fighting spirit! 1

Qin Yu was similarly worried.

However, he also understood that he couldn’t help much now. The only thing he could do was to cultivate with all his might.

Qin Yu patted the shoulders of the two brothers, and then jumped into the flames.

The Tongues of fire crazily devoured Qin Yu, bringing about a great pain.

In the outside world, the predicament that Wen Wanji encountered was even more terrifying.

The three of them stood in the most conspicuous place of the Wen family manor, quietly waiting for the arrival of the Heavenly Cloud sect.

The three of them knew that tomorrow was the day of the final battle.

That night was extremely restless. Dark clouds covered the sky, and a sandstorm swept through the world as if it was a sign of something.

The next morning, under the command of the first elder, people rushed toward the Wen family manor like a tide.

In a short while, dense traces appeared in the sky.

The crowd led by the first elder and the deputy sect master was looking at Wen Wanji and the other two coldly.

“You don’t know life from death.”The first elder snorted and then landed below.

His body that was like a swallow floated over.

The great elder put his hands behind his back and slowly walked in front of Wen Wanji.

“Wen Wanji, where is he?”The Great Elder asked straightforwardly.

“Who is he?”Wen Wanji continued to play dumb.

The Great Elder said with a gloomy face, “It seems that you don’t take the sect leader’s words to heart. Hand over Qin Yu, or else the Wen family won’t be spared!”

“F * ck your mother!”Wen Wanli suddenly roared angrily. His thick arms instantly shattered his clothes, and a terrifying spiritual power mixed with killing intent rushed toward the great elder!

No one expected Wen Wanli to directly attack without saying anything!

The great battle immediately began at this moment. The Great Elder hurriedly responded, and was forced back several steps!

This undoubtedly infuriated the great elder! He wildly danced, his face grim as he coldly stared at Wen Wanji.

“Everyone, listen up,”the first elder said coldly.

“Leave Wen Wanji to me. I want the remaining two people to disappear as soon as possible!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

With a single command, the battle began.

The dark clouds were forced back, and even space itself began to buzz.

Even the extremely stable saint-level combatants couldn’t endure it any longer.

This battle would definitely attract the attention of the world.

...

At the mouth of the volcano, Qin Yu was using flames to temper his body.

The effects of the flames were extremely good, and they were quite compatible with Qin Yu.

According to this rate of progress, it wouldn’t be long before his flesh God would be able to advance a few more steps.

Wen Da and Wen er stared at Qin Yu from above, and then Wen da slowly said, “Grandfather seemed to have said that he wanted to let Qin Yu’s physical body enter the return to void stage.”

“That’s right.”Wen Er was also unusually serious.

“If his physical body enters the return to void stage, that means that no one can harm his physical body in the Almighty Stage.”

“This is really a crazy idea.”

Wen Da glanced at Wen er and said, “Don’t think too easily. It’s not that simple for the physical body to enter the return to void stage. Moreover, even if he really enters the return to void stage, it doesn’t mean that others don’t have the means to counter him.”

“That’s true.”Wen Er nodded in agreement.

Then, they all looked into the distance.

That position was in the direction of the Wen family.

The feeling of not being able to help was very uncomfortable. Even with Wen Da and Wen Er’s temperament, they felt a bit guilty at this moment.

At this moment, the Wen family manor had already turned into ruins.

The battle continued for three days. Wen Wanji and the other two fought against the Elite Forces of the Heavenly Cloud sect, but they were actually not at a disadvantage for a long time.

And the most miserable one was the first elder.

He had been forced back by Wen Wanji many times. His body was bleeding, and his aura was very weak.

On the other hand, Wen Wanji was charging forward like a wild beast, as if he was not exhausted.

“Boom!”

Another beam of bright light came from the sky, cutting the first elder’s long robe and breaking one of his arms.

Even though he had the protective dharma treasure of the Heavenly Cloud sect, it was completely shattered at this moment.

The first elder panted heavily, and a hint of fear appeared in his eyes.

“This Wen Wanli... he really lives up to his reputation...”the first elder wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, and his teeth were grinding.

However, Wen Wanli didn’t care about this. He directly rushed towards the first elder.

The first elder was pushed and pushed repeatedly, looking extremely pathetic.

“Didn’t you want to fight with me? Come at me!”Wen Wanli roared angrily and actually shattered the space!

In the next second, Wen Wanli’s body emerged from the space fragment. Then, he clasped his palms together, and a terrifying aura exploded in front of the first elder!

“Bang Bang Bang!”

The first Elder was beaten until he vomited blood, and his body almost fell down several times.

“This won’t do. If this continues, I’m afraid I’ll lose.”The first Elder’s expression was incomparably ugly.

These loose cultivators who stood at the peak of the South Province had indeed exceeded his imagination.

Now wasn’t the time to show off, so the first elder didn’t waste any words. He immediately gathered many experts, planning to surround and annihilate Wen Wanji.

Several late-stage or even peak-stage mighty figures surrounded Wen Wanji.

They looked coldly at Wen Wanji. A cold killing intent that was as cold as water appeared in this small encirclement.

Wen Wanji swept his gaze over everyone and sneered, “What? Didn’t you say that you wanted to fight me? Are You Afraid Now? You really are a little bastard who doesn’t follow the rules.”

The great elder wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and said coldly, “Wen wanye, this isn’t a battle between the two of us. It’s a war. A war with the goal of winning! If you’re afraid, hand over the person!”

“Hahahaha!”

As soon as these words were said, Wen wanye couldn’t help but laugh heartily.

“I, Wen wanye, have lived for so many years and have never known what it means to hand over the person. All of you can attack together. I, Wen Wanye, have nothing to fear!”Wen wanye’s heroic voice spread throughout the entire Wen family manor!

The great elder gritted his teeth and said, “Wen Wanji, aren’t you afraid of death! ?”

Wen wanji shouted loudly, “Since ancient times, who hasn’t died? How can we cowards be afraid of death! What’s more, it’s not that easy to kill me with just a few stinky fish and shrimps like you. Come On!”

“Alright, Attack! Kill him!”The great elder did not waste any more words. A group of people blotted out the sky and covered the earth as they charged straight at Wen Wanji!
