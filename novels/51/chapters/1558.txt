Qin Yu’s face was as dark as water. The more he thought about it, the angrier he became.

This he teng had caused trouble for Qin Yu many times back on Earth. Who would have thought that after coming to the holy region, he would still be so sinister.

“Qin Yu, the white bone club is lost. You have to find it for us,”at this moment, a hunter in the crowd said.

“That’s right. For so many years, the white bone club has never left the hunter organization. This is also the protection of our hunter organization. Now that the White Bone Club is lost, the hunter organization is very likely to be threatened...”

Qin Yu also fell silent.

Without the white bone club, the hunter organization was indeed like a tiger that had lost its fangs, losing its deterrent force.

“I will bring back the white bone club as soon as possible,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Although that was the case, everyone understood in their hearts.

As soon as possible? How long was as soon as possible? One Day? Ten Days? Or according to the year?

Would the hunter organization be able to hold out until then?

Qin Yu also saw through everyone’s doubts. He said in a deep voice, “Everyone, don’t be anxious. Before I leave, I will definitely think of a countermeasure, a countermeasure that can guarantee the hunter organization.”

“Ai, Qin Yu, then I can only trouble you.”Everyone sighed. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude. He planned to set up a formation in the hunter organization’s headquarters to protect the safety of the hunter organization.

......

On the other side.

He Teng had already brought Zhong Wu and escaped for hundreds of stars.

His speed could be said to be abnormal!

The two of them stopped in an uninhabited area.

He Teng was as usual. His entire body was wrapped in a black robe and his true appearance could not be seen. However, the internal Qi emitted from his body was extremely evil.

Zhong Wu looked at he teng and said, “Who are you? Why did you save me? Also, what is your relationship with Qin Yu?”

He Teng narrowed his eyes and said with a faint smile, “Are you asking me...”

Zhong wu said coldly, “Is there a second person here? Let me tell you, I...”

“Pa!”

Before Zhong Wu could finish, he teng suddenly stretched out a skinny palm and directly pierced through Zhong Wu’s head!

Zhong Wu stared at He Teng, as if he couldn’t believe everything in front of him.

Before he died, he never thought that he teng would suddenly attack and directly take his life!

“Reckless Fellow, do you really think that I’m doing this to save you... Hehe...”he teng said sinisterly.

He snatched the white bone club from Zhong Wu’s hand and an extremely sinisterly smile appeared on his face.

“With this white bone club, who else can stop me... Hahaha!”He Teng’s impudent smile was deafening for miles in Mianyang!

“Why didn’t you fight with Qin Yu just now...”at this moment, another voice suddenly came out of He Teng’s mouth.

He Teng said coldly, “I’m not his opponent now, Qin Yu.”

“Hehe... After so many years, when did you win against him? And when can you become his opponent?”That voice sounded again, but it was full of sarcasm.

This time, he teng surprisingly did not get angry. On the contrary, he used the same sarcastic tone to reply, “What About You? A fellow who has been absorbed by me, do you have the qualifications to mock me?”

That voice coldly said, “You don’t have that chance. I will not let you completely absorb it...”

“Hahahaha! Then let us wait and see.”He Teng coldly said.

...

Hunter organization.

In the past few days, many hunters felt extremely uneasy.

Many sects had coveted the hunter organization for many years. Now that they had lost the white bone club, who knew how many sects would take advantage of it.

However, after a few days, the hunter organization was calm and peaceful.

“With Qin Yu around, who would dare to come and make trouble?”

“Indeed, the current Qin Yu’s strength is not weaker than the three maniacs and three uniques.”

“I don’t think the three maniacs and three uniques will be able to take on the white bone staff head-on.”

The anxious hearts of everyone slowly relaxed. Many hunters began to return to the green rock forest to hunt.

Three days later, Qin Yu finally found the formation.

This formation was called the Dragon Protection Formation. It was a formation that could be activated on its own. Once it encountered a strong enemy, this formation would be activated on its own.

In addition, those who possessed the dragon protection formation could also activate this formation on their own.

If there were any problems within the hunter organization, they could activate this formation on their own and eliminate their internal enemies.

In other words, once they possessed this formation, they would have almost all the rights of the hunter organization.

Therefore, the person who possessed this formation had to be a person who was righteous enough.

After thinking about it, Qin Yu decided to let Jing Bai and Guan Zhuang hold this formation at the same time. Only when both of them made the decision at the same time could the formation be activated.

“To set up the Dragon Protection Formation, I need a batch of materials. I’m afraid I have to make a trip to Gu City,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Therefore, Qin Yu and Jing Bai said their goodbyes and rushed towards Gu City.

At the same time, a piece of news spread out:

Yong Ji had given up on Yong Ji City and defected to the northern lands!

Once this news spread out, the entire South Province could not help but be greatly shocked!

“Yong Ji that bastard actually defected to the Northern Lands!”

“He is one of the three uniques, how could he do such a thing!”

“If I had known this would happen, I would have helped the Heavenly Cloud sect back then and killed Yong Ji together!”

Everyone could not help but be furious. No one had expected that Yong Ji would openly defect to the northern lands!

“I knew that this guy is not a good person.”Jue Wu wrinkled her nose and could not help but look angry.

Qu zhu stretched and said, “It is only a matter of time before Yongji seeks refuge with the northern lands. If he doesn’t seek refuge with the northern lands, I’m afraid he will die in the southern region.”

At this point, qu Zhu suddenly said coldly, “Just wait and see. There will definitely be more and more people seeking refuge with the northern lands.”

...

Qin Yu, who had just arrived at Gu City, also heard this news.

Sitting in the teahouse drinking tea, his expression couldn’t help but turn cold.

“This Yongji... I really should have killed him back then.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but clench his fists.

As one of the three unique skills, Yongji’s strength was extremely powerful.

More importantly, the outstanding talents of the Southern Region’s younger generation were also brought to the northern lands by him.

This was an extremely terrifying force. The influx of fresh blood would only make the already powerful northern lands even more arrogant.

“Looks like I have to head to the northern border as soon as possible,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Then, Qin Yu stood up and walked out of the teahouse, starting to search for the materials to set up the Dragon Protection Array.

Gu city was close to the hunter organization, so their materials were extremely rich.

Qin Yu spent two days to gather most of the materials for the Dragon Protection Array.

With these materials, it should be enough to set up the Dragon Protection Array, Qin Yu thought while sitting in the inn.

Then, he reached out his hand and took out the iron rod.

After thinking for a while, Qin Yu said in a low voice, “I’ll use this iron rod as the core of the array. It can be considered as a repayment for the white bone rod they lost.”
