Chapter 413: Another Invitation! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu didn’t waste any time. He immediately took a taxi and rushed towards the Cao family’s home.

As the largest aristocratic family in Yunchuan, the Cao family’s residence was naturally quite luxurious.

When Qin Yu arrived, he was shockd to find that the Cao family’s home was completely deserted.

“Looks like he received the news long ago.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh coldly.

He released his divine sense and quickly captured a few figures.

In the Cao family home’s hidden area, there were a total of three Inner Strength Grandmasters.

And one of them was currently in the hall. Presumably, it was Cao Shan.

“Three Inner Strength Grandmasters aren’t worth mentioning.” Qin Yu strode towards the Cao family’s home.

The path was smooth and unobstructed. In a few steps, he arrived at the Cao family home’s living room.

Cao Shan was sipping his tea and he looked very pleased with himself.

He wasn’t the least bit shocked by Qin Yu’s arrival.

“Qin Yu, you really came for me.” Cao Shan put down the teacup in his hand and said indifferently.

Qin Yu looked at Cao Shan coldly and said, “Yan Jiang died in your hands. Do you think I will let you go?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Oh really?” Cao Shan raised his eyebrows.

“You dared to come to my home alone. Aren’t you afraid of dying here?”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “You’re no threat to me.”

“Hahaha!” Cao Shan immediately laughed out loud.

“The rumors about you on the Martial Arts Forum are endless. They say that you’re a genius that only appears once in a thousand years. I, Cao Shan, really want to experience your prowess today.” Cao Shan slowly stood up.

The internal qi on his body quickly reached its peak state!

The peak state of an Inner Strength Grandmaster was extremely terrifying and caused the entire room to buzz and tremble!

The ground beneath Qin Yu’s feet began to crumble, and cracks began to appear!

An extremely powerful pressure spread over. Someone weak would probably be crushed by this pressure!

“Come, let me see the prowess of a genius like you!”

Cao Shan shouted angrily and raised his hand to unleash his famous “Twin Dragon Fists”!

The moment the Twin Dragon Fists materialized, a dragon’s roar sounded in his ears!

“Swish! Swish!”

Two streams of internal qi carried a turbulent current as they rushed towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s expression was calm and there was no discernible emotion.

He casually raised his hand and used the strength of his palm to disperse the two streams of internal qi!

Cao Shan’s eyes flashed with shock, and then he exclaimed, “It seems like the rumors are true! You really have quite the ability!”

Qin Yu said coldly, “I don’t have time to waste with you. Killing you is my goal.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Qin Yu’s body was covered with rays of golden light!

This incomparably powerful internal qi, with Qin Yu as the center, rapidly fluctuated in all directions!

After he sensed this internal qi, Cao Shan’s expression suddenly changed drastically!

Was this really the internal qi of someone who had just entered the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm?

“Swoosh!”

Qin Yu didn’t have any intention of prolonging the battle. He used the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique, and the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist appeared in front of Cao Shan in the blink of an eye!

After he sensed the immense power, Cao Shan’s heart immediately thumped!

This power was far beyond Cao Shan’s comprehension!

Boom!

There was no way for him to dodge this punch!

A dazzling and radiant light shone!

Cao Shan hurriedly responded and used all of his techniques, but there was nothing he could do in the face of these two powerful fists!

Boom!

Cao Shan’s body was struck by the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist.

His entire body smashed through several levels of the Cao family home’s walls.

The luxurious Cao family home couldn’t hold on any longer and started to slowly collapse!

It was as if an earthquake had happened. It was extremely chaotic!

Blood dripped from the corner of Cao Shan’s mouth as he struggled to climb out of the rubble.

His eyes were filled with fear! Cracks appeared on his chest!

This was the protective armor, the secret treasure of the Cao family!

For decades, Cao Shan had never taken it off, but now, it was shattered by this punch!

“In just a few short months, how could he have improved so quickly?!” Cao Shan wiped the corner of his mouth while feeling a lingering sense of fear inside!

If Xiao Cheng hadn’t sent the magic tool, he wouldn’t have escaped death today.

“He actually didn’t die?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

“That’s good. It’s indeed a pity to kill you just like that,” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

In the next second, he once again used Shrinking Ground Into An Inch and instantly appeared in front of Cao Shan.

Just as Qin Yu was about to use the Heaven Swallowing Technique, Cao Shan suddenly opened his mouth slightly. A divine seal diagram was spat out from his mouth!

“Huh?” Qin Yu’s eyes flashed with shock.

Before he could regain his senses, the divine seal was already growing bigger and bigger in the air! In the end, it became astonishingly big!

“Bullsh*t, watch me crush it with one punch!” Qin Yu punched it with his golden fists with disregard for the consequences!

“Boom!”

Under the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist, the divine seal was actually slightly shaken!

This scene shocked both sides!

Qin Yu was shocked that this punch actually didn’t cause any damage to the divine seal!

And in the dark, Xiao Cheng was shocked that Qin Yu’s punch actually shook the divine seal a little!

“Such strength is really unheard of!” Xiao Cheng’s eyes shone with eagerness!

As the divine seal slowly suppressed him, Qin Yu’s body also began to feel a wave of pressure.

Qin Yu refused to give in and once again clenched his fist to smash it!

“Rumble!”

This powerful impact actually caused the divine seal to retreat a few steps!

Although it was only a few millimeters, it still caused Cao Shan and Xiao Cheng to feel greatly shocked!

One had to know that when Cao Shan faced this divine seal, he didn’t have the slightest ability to retaliate!

“D*mn, this kid is a monster.” Cao Shan couldn’t help but curse inwardly!

Although Qin Yu’s powerful fist was unparalleled, this divine seal was a secret treasure passed down from hundreds of years ago after all. Even Qin Yu was unable to resist it.

The divine seal pressed down like a five-fingered mountain, and pressed Qin Yu to the ground.

“Swoosh!”

The divine seal flashed with light and seemed to have added a level of seal as it firmly pressed Qin Yu to the ground.

No matter how hard Qin Yu struggled, the divine seal was no longer affected in the slightest.

Seeing this, Cao Shan finally heaved a sigh of relief.

“Fortunately, I had this treasure.” Cao Shan wiped the sweat from his forehead and finally heaved a sigh of relief.

He quickly walked in front of Qin Yu and raised his foot to kick Qin Yu’s face.

“D*mn, you scared me to death. I almost got killed by you.” Cao Shan wiped the sweat from his forehead and cursed.

Qin Yu looked at Cao Shan coldly and didn’t say a word.

“Mr. Xiao, you can come out now.” Cao Shan shouted to the dark.

Before he finished his words, he saw a man coming with his hands behind his back.

He walked quickly to Qin Yu and nodded slightly. “Qin Yu, you’re the first person who can shake this divine seal map.”

Qin Yu wasn’t in the mood to listen to his bullsh*t. Instead, he asked coldly, “Who are you?”

“The Hong Yi Sect’s Xiao Cheng,” Xiao Cheng said indifferently.

“The Hong Yi Sect again?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

“Hmph, if it weren’t for Mr. Xiao, I’m afraid I really would have died here today,” Cao Shan said coldly from the side.

Qin Yu ignored Cao Shan and looked at Xiao Cheng coldly while saying, “The Hong Yi Sect is really persistent.”

Xiao Cheng wasn’t angry. He smiled nonchalantly and said, “Qin Yu, to tell you the truth, everyone in the Hong Yi Sect admires you very much. Moreover, we have issued many invitations to you.”

“This time, I can also give you another chance. If you’re willing to join the Hong Yi Sect, not only will I guarantee that you won’t die, but I will also let you become an elder of the Hong Yi Sect,” Xiao Cheng said indifferently.

Hearing this, Cao Shan, who was beside him, immediately became anxious.

He hurriedly said, “Mr. Xiao, he must die! If he doesn’t die, I will die!”

Xiao Cheng glanced at Cao Shan and then continued, “Qin Yu, if you’re willing to join the Hong Yi Sect, I can kill Cao Shan for you.”
