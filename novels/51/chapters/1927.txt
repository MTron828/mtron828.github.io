1928 Gu Xinghe?

Yue Lingdong immediately regretted it. He had guessed earlier that Qin Yu had an extraordinary identity, but he did not expect it to be so terrifying!

Thinking of this, Yue Lingdong immediately knelt and said with a trembling voice, “It’s…it’s my fault. Big Brother, please… please spare me. I beg you…”

“Spare you?” Qin Yu sneered and said. “I let you off once, and then what happened? You wanted to kill me using the strength of another. Do you think you still have a chance?”

After saying this, Qin Yu waved his hand and ordered, “Kill him!”

“Yes!”

The subordinates of the general-in-chief immediately attacked, and several of them slashed at Yue Lingdong simultaneously.

In a short while, Yue Lingdong was smashed into meat paste. Even his primordial spirit could not escape.

After killing Yue Lingdong, Qin Yu put on an act and said, “Alright, you guys keep an eye on this mine. Don’t let anyone get close. Did you hear me? ”

“Yes!” the group of people shouted.

Qin Yu could not help but sigh. No wonder everyone yearned for power. This feeling was really awesome.

After that, Qin Yu left the mine and returned to the palace.

Standing at the entrance of the Great Hall, Qin Yu was waiting for the general-in-chief quietly.

After about an hour, the general finally walked out.

He glanced at Qin Yu and said, “How was it?”

“No problem. I’ve killed him,” Qin Yu said.

“Mmm, ” the general-in-chief responded and said, “Follow me. City Lord is waiting for you inside.”

After saying that, bringing Qin Yu with him, the general-in-chief took several turns and finally stopped at an entrance.

Big words were written on the door, “Military and Political Affairs Office”.

“When you see City Lord later, don’t talk nonsense. Understand?” the general-in-chief said.

“Don’t worry,” Qin Yu nodded and said.

The general-in-chief did not say anything else. He pushed open the office door and walked in with Qin Yu.

As soon as Qin Yu stepped into the Military and Political Affairs Office, he felt an incredibly strong sense of oppression.

This sense of oppression seemed to come from some kind of magical artifact.

Qin Yu looked up. Sure enough, magical artifacts were hanging in every corner. The internal qi emitted by these artifacts was comparable to that of Saint Weapons.

“City Lord, he’s here,” the general-in-chief cupped his hands and said.

There was a tea table not far away. At this moment, the city lord’s back was facing Qin Yu.

Hearing the general-in-chief’s words, the city lord slowly turned around.

“Eh?”

Upon seeing the city lord’s face, Qin Yu’s face turned pale instantly!

It was because this person was none other than an old friend from Earth, Gu Xinghe!

“It’s… It’s you!” Qin Yu’s face was shocked and ashen.

When Gu Xinghe saw Qin Yu in front of him, he was a little stunned. Then he laughed and said, “Qin Yu? It’s you! Hahaha! Hahaha!”

Gu Xinghe’s exaggerated laughter reverberated throughout the entire Great Hall, hurting people’s ears!

“City Lord, you know him?” the general-in-chief asked suspiciously.

“Yes, I know him. Of course, I know him! Back then, he destroyed my cultivation,” Gu Xinghe squinted his eyes and said with a vague smile.

Qin Yu had a bad feeling in his heart. He never thought his words would come true that he actually knew this city lord!

“City Lord, I’ll kill him now!” the general-in-chief quickly said.

However, Gu Xinghe waved his hand. He looked at Qin Yu with a vague smile and said, “When old friends meet, we should reminisce about the past. How can we fight and kill each other? You can leave first.”

The general-in-chief opened his mouth, then bowed and said, “Yes.”

After the general-in-chief left, Gu Xinghe stood up and said with a smile, “Qin Yu, you didn’t expect this, did you? I’ve recovered my cultivation, and I’m now a member of the Si family!”

Qin Yu’s face was extremely ugly. In his mind, he was thinking about how to escape.

“Qin Yu, you look very nervous,” Gu Xinghe sneered and said.

“Gu Xinghe, what do you want?” Qin Yu said coldly. “Just be direct. No need to talk nonsense.”

While speaking, Qin Yu had quietly mobilized the internal qi in his body, preparing to fight to the death.

Gu Xinghe sneered and said, “What do you think I want? Back then, you destroyed my cultivation and everything I had! What do you think I want?”

Qin Yu knew it would be difficult to settle this peacefully today. Without further ado, he shook his body and released an extremely terrifying internal qi! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

However, Gu Xinghe’s tone suddenly changed as he chuckled and said, “Qin Yu, why are you so nervous? I was just joking with you. Hahaha!”

“What do you mean?” Qin Yu was stunned.

Gu Xinghe waved his hand dismissively and said, “let bygones be bygones. I don’t have many old friends left. I don’t want to be so calculative with you anymore.”

Qin Yu was dumbfounded and stood there at a loss.

“Come, sit down and have a drink,” Gu Xinghe said with a smile. “Let’s catch up.”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment and then sat opposite Gu Xinghe.

Gu Xinghe poured a cup of tea for Qin Yu, sighed, and said, “This world is really scary. Speaking of which, I kind of miss our past.”

Qin Yu did not say anything. He was wary of Gu Xinghe because this person was extremely sinister.

...

“Speaking of which, do you have any news about the others? I’ve been looking for them all these years, but I couldn’t find anyone other than Yan Ruoxue. Sigh.” Gu Xinghe sighed.

“Me too,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“If there’s a chance, I must find them.” Gu Xinghe picked up the cup of tea on the table and finished it in one gulp.

He scanned Qin Yu with his divine sense and said in surprise, “You’ve already reached the Reversion Void Stage?”

“Yes, I was lucky,” Qin Yu answered casually and calml.

“Not bad. As expected of the number one person on Earth previously,” Gu Xinghe said with a smile.

“I’m not comparable to you,” Qin Yu said with a vague smile. “I didn’t expect you to be at the middle stage of Reversion Void. You’ve even become the city lord of Serene South City.”

“Ah, it’s a long story. For the position of city lord, I’ve put in a lot of effort and suffered a lot,” Gu Xinghe said helplessly, shaking his head.

Qin Yu didn’t respond, and the atmosphere suddenly became a little awkward.

The two used to be sworn enemies, so Qin Yu did not dare to trust him easily now.

“By the way, Yan Ruoxue is actually the saintess of the Yan family, one of the nine great aristocratic families. Her bloodline is truly unique,” Gu Xinghe suddenly said.

...

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded and didn’t say anything.

“You know Si Shiyue, do you? He’s our young lord, and just like you, he has a chaotic body,” Gu Xinghe said.

“I heard that he and Yan Ruoxue are about to get engaged. With your personality, I’m sure you won’t tolerate such a thing, will you?”

Qin Yu opened his mouth but didn’t know how to answer. He was afraid that Gu Xinghe would convey it to Si Shiyue.
