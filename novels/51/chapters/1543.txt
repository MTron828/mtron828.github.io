Chapter 1544: Chapter 1,544, Unique Dance’s Constitution 1

Seeing that Yong Ji was gloomy and uncertain, Sima Bei was not anxious.

He looked coldly at Yong Ji and said, “Of course, you can also stay here and wait for the sect Master of the Heavenly Cloud sect to come out of seclusion.”

“With your ability, I believe you can handle it.”Sima bei said in a strange tone.

After saying this, Sima bei turned around and was about to leave.

“Wait.”

At this time, Yong Ji suddenly called out to Sima Bei.

He slowly stood up and said in a deep voice, “If I join the northern lands, what benefits will I get? As far as I know, the northern lands are not suitable for cultivation.”

Sima bei said indifferently, “Yong Ji, you have to understand that I’m not asking you to join the northern lands, but to save you.”

Yong Ji’s face sank. He didn’t expect that Sima bei would actually be so arrogant.

At this moment, Sima bei changed the topic and said indifferently, “Of course, if you join the northern lands, the northern lands will naturally treat you well. Once we take down any place in the southern region, I guarantee that I will give priority to you.”

“Apart from that, we will teach you the Northern Lands’secret arts for free.”

“With your talent, once you obtain the Northern Lands’secret arts, I believe that you will definitely become one of the strongest people.”

A slap and a sweet date. Yong Ji naturally understood this logic.

......

However, at the moment, he did not have much of a choice. Once he started a war with the heavenly cloud sect, it meant that there was no way out.

“Damn it...”Yong Ji’s expression was gloomy. If it was not for Qin Yu’s sudden intervention, he would not have fallen to such a state!

“I’ll give you three days to consider it. I Won’t wait for it to expire,”Sima Bei said coldly.

After saying this, Sima bei turned around and left.

...

On the other side, the heavenly cloud sect had already begun to rebuild, and Qin Yu was planning to head to the northern lands.

Now, Qin Yu’s reputation had already spread throughout the southern province. Almost everyone knew of Qin Yu’s great name and his proud battle achievements.

In the sky, a godly eagle passed by.

“Look, it’s Qin Yu’s Godly Eagle!”

“Where is he going? is he going to the northern lands?”

“I don’t know. Looking at this direction, he should be going to Mount Hua Ning.”

No matter where Qin Yu went, he would attract countless gazes.

He walked all the way towards Mount Hua Ning, intending to say goodbye to Wen Dawen before leaving.

However, when Qin Yu returned to Mount Hua Ning, he was surprised to find that Mount Hua Ning was surprisingly lively today.

Several auras were emitted from Mount Hua Ning, each of which was extremely powerful. The internal Qi was extremely powerful.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He activated his desolate divine eye and looked at Mount Hua Ning.

Following that, he realized that Jue Wu had returned!

Other than her, Qu Zhu and the others were also present.

“Jue Wu has returned?”Qin Yu could not help but be shocked. He did not have the time to think about it. He immediately withdrew his figure and rushed in the direction of Jue Wu.

In the pavilion, Jue Wu was drinking wine and eating meat.

Looking at her ruddy face, she must have drunk quite a lot of wine.

Qin Yu quickly walked forward and said in surprise, “Aren’t you in the northern lands? Why did you suddenly come back?”

Jue Wu waved to Qin Yu and said, “Come, come, come. Quickly sit down. Let’s have a good drink.”

However, Qin Yu didn’t have such thoughts. Something must have happened for Jue Wu to suddenly return to Mount Hua Ning.

He sat next to Jue Wu with unease and asked in a deep voice, “What exactly happened?”

“What can happen? Hurry up and drink. Don’t ask blindly.”Jue Wu rolled his eyes.

Although that was the case, Qin Yu still felt uneasy.

However, Jue Wu didn’t say anything, so Qin Yu could only drink with them.

After three rounds of drinking, the banquet was temporarily over.

Qin Yu followed behind Jue Wu. He wanted to ask her about it, but Jue Wu used the excuse of not being able to drink as an excuse to turn around and return to his room, not leaving the room.

This made Qin Yu, who was already suspicious, even more suspicious.

“What exactly happened...”Qin Yu frowned.

This character didn’t seem like Jue Wu.

...

There was a land of absolute change on Mount Hua Ning. It bathed in sunlight during the day and moonlight at night.

Qin Yu sat there and looked into the distance. No one knew what he was thinking about.

“Are you worried about Jue Wu?”

At this moment, a voice suddenly came from behind.

Qin Yu did not turn around. He only sighed slightly and said, “Yes, how can I not be worried? Big Brother Qu Zhu, do you know something?”

Qu Zhu sat beside Qin Yu. He had a dog tail grass in his mouth. He said somewhat casually, “What do you think happened?”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “I’m afraid that Jue Wu was injured. He came back to recuperate.”

Qu Zhu stretched lazily and said, “If she was only injured, I don’t think there’s a need for Jue Wu to come back from the north.”

As soon as he said this, Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed.

He hurriedly looked at Qu Zhu and said in a deep voice, “What do you mean?”

Qu Zhu’s expression also became somewhat solemn.

He looked at Qin Yu and said, “You should be very clear about Jue Wu’s talent. She doesn’t even need to cultivate to be able to raise her cultivation.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. Of course, he knew this.

Qu Zhu continued, “Everything has its pros and cons. It’s the same with Jue Wu’s talent.”

“I’ve read a lot of information and history books. I’ve looked up this kind of constitution.”

“This kind of constitution is called Nirvana body. Cultivators with this kind of constitution are not only powerful and talented, but also have cultivation methods that make others envy them.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Qin Yu didn’t say anything and waited for Qu Zhu to continue.

Qu Zhu continued, “But... according to the information I’ve read, Nirvana body’s maximum lifespan is less than a thousand years, while absolute dance is already more than eight hundred years old.”

Qin Yu’s expression couldn’t help but change!

In other words, absolute dance had already reached the limit of her lifespan?

How was this possible? She looked like a little loli who had yet to grow up. No one could associate her with a dying old man!

Qu Zhu seemed to see Qin Yu’s confusion, he said, “Don’t look at the current ultimate dance like a little child who has yet to grow up. But according to what I know, in the last few years of her life, her appearance will rapidly age until she becomes an old woman.”

As soon as these words were said, Qin Yu’s expression instantly became even uglier!

That loli-like Jue Wu actually aged at a speed visible to the naked eye?

Not to mention Qin Yu, even Jue Wu herself probably couldn’t tolerate it, right?

“Then, is there any way to break this constitution?”Qin Yu asked.

Qu zhu sighed and said, “I haven’t found any way to break it yet anyway.”

“What are you two talking about?”

At this moment, Jue Wu’s voice suddenly appeared behind the two of them.

Qu Zhu stretched lazily and winked at Qin Yu. “I didn’t say anything. I’m leaving.”

After saying that, qu Zhu turned around and was about to leave.

“Stop right there!”However, Jue Wu stopped Qu Zhu.
