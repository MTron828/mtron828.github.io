“It’s strange. More and more strange things happening in the core region recently. First, countless living beings appeared out of thin air, and then there were Starry Sandworms. Could it be related to the loss of the Saint Power?

Moreover, the entire Saint Kingdom seems to be shielded by the heavenly secrets. Even Lord Zhou himself is unable to see the heavenly secrets. How strange!”

Seeing his grandson go out, Lord Tang’s loving expression suddenly turned cold. He muttered to himself in a voice he could hear.

Qin Yu was just a small matter to him. The strange things that had happened recently made him feel a strong sense of unease.

At this moment, the winding tunnel had countless forks in the mine Qin Yu was in.

Each of them extended into an extremely deep and dark place. Anyone who entered any of the passages had to walk for a few days and nights without seeing the end.

Along the way, countless bones were casually dropped into the mine.

The further Qin Yu walked in, the more frightened he felt.

The bones on the ground had already exceeded his imagination. There were at least hundreds of thousands of remains here.

Who knew how many remnant souls had died to excavate the ore here?

These remains included humans, the monster race, and the demon race. There seemed to be the orc race and the other races that Qin Yu had never seen before.

Judging from the internal qi of these corpses, many of the natives here had also died tragically in addition to the outsiders.

Every bone was extremely fragile. They would turn into powder if one stepped on them.

“What a cruel method! Moreover, some people seem to have been tortured before.”

Qin Yu sighed slightly.

After being refined by the holy energy, the bones of Dao Realm cultivators would stay for thousands of years after they died. The Holy Bones could even be used as weapons.

One could tell from these fragile skeletons that they had been drained when they were alive. Moreover, some of their bones were twisted and their bodies were distorted.

This meant that even after these living beings worked continuously, they still

suffered from torture from time to time.

“No wonder I sensed boundless resentment the moment I entered this mine!”Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qin Yu’s expression was somewhat solemn. Originally, he only wanted to enter to look for some ore.

But now, it seemed that the mine would not be peaceful.

“Strange. Why do I feel like someone is staring at me?”

Qin Yu suddenly activated the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze, but it was in vain.

He frowned slightly. Could it be that he was hallucinating?

After hesitating for a moment, Qin Yu continued to move forward. Now, there was a master in his sea of consciousness.

If he wanted to continue cultivating, he would need holy energy ore. Moreover, his three Hearts of Saint Kingdom had a strange reaction.

He had never felt this restless power before.

Thus, Qin Yu wanted to find out if there was a hidden Heart of Saint Kingdom here.

Qin Yu moved his feet and once again advanced at full speed.

Even with his holy body, he could not see the end after moving for nearly a day.

At this moment, he was already somewhat numb. Qin Yu did not even know how many forks he had passed.

Every time, he chose the leftmost side to continue forward. This mine was so deep that it was terrifying. He didn’t even know how deep he had come to.

A cold hand slowly touched Qin Yu’s neck.

An extremely cold intent spread directly from his neck to Qin Yu’s chest, instantly giving him goosebumps.

Fleeing Shadow!

Qin Yu reacted immediately. His shadow suddenly moved and pulled him to the side.

“No one?”

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. Moreover, he could see a handprint on his neck through the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze.

“What dense dark murderous aura! Could it be an evil thing that was born?

However, why can’t I see it even with the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze?”

Qin Yu had only experienced this kind of murderous aura once, and that was in the lower realm’s Sky City.

At that time, the entire Great Xia royal family had been exterminated. The Sky City also contained a similar power.

However, the murderous aura here was even more terrifying. It was mixed with extreme dark energy and resentment.

Who was it?

At the corner ahead, three figures were suddenly grabbed by Qin Yu.

His feet trembled and he appeared in front of the three people almost instantly.

The three people in front of him had long lost their internal qi. Their pupils dilated.

Even before they died, they revealed an expression of extreme fear. Qin Yu examined them.

The three of them had probably died not too long ago. Their clothes and magical artifacts were not lost.

There was no damage on the surface of their bodies but there was a black-green handprint on their heart.

“Their hearts are shattered. It seems like a fatal wound. Moreover, the person can attack directly through their clothes with the magical artifacts. What a

strange method!”

Qin Yu’s expression was solemn. It was impossible to determine the strength of these three dead people.

However, the strength of these three people would not be low judging from the magic tools their bodies.

“What a strange mine!”

At this moment, Qin Yu also felt that something was wrong. His body was getting heavier and heavier.

He didn’t know what changes had happened, but with the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze, he could detect any strange fluctuations in the surroundings.

However, he had never noticed any abnormal movements before his body changed. Therefore, this change made him even more worried.

After a careful inspection, he still could not find anything else.

Only then did Qin Yu leave. However, he also found something useful when he searched the magical artifacts of these three people.

Winding Silk Gloves!

He wore gloves on both hands and flicked his index finger, sending a transparent thread to the wall at the end.

With a pull of his finger, his entire body was pulled over.

Then, he used his other hand to shoot out the coiling silk again. With this glove, his speed increased by several times.

Moreover, it was much easier than before. He was like a spider.

His body flashed through the mine cave.

When he went deeper, he heard a faint shout. What made him most uneasy was that his body was getting heavier and heavier.

Despite his body strength, he felt sleepy.

Qin Yu had just stopped. He heard a commotion coming from the front this time. Moreover, it did not seem to be very far away from him! “Brother, are we right? If you lose, you have to give me ten copper-gold ores!” “Hahahaha! You brat! You’re something. You even discovered this.”

“That’s right. I experimented for a long time before I figured it out.” “Hahaha! Hurry up, cut a few more times, and see if the meat will be more tender! ”

The cries of a child and a woman could be heard from the crowd.

Could that place be the Path of Heaven Academy’s point of contact?

A house was at the front. The flames were very eye-catching in the darkness.

Qin Yu did not even think about it and directly flicked a thread in that direction, pulling him over..
