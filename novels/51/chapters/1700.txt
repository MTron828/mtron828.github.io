Chapter 1701: Chapter 1,701, replacement of Man with the mustache Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

He had wanted to imitate Xiao Sheng and travel around the world to gain enlightenment, but now it seemed impossible.

Qin Yu left wind bamboo mountain. He walked on the street, trying to think of a solution.

There was still a month before the death river disappeared. During this month, it was like the last carnival in the South Province. Everyone’s faces were filled with smiles. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

During this period of time, there were still people who were making breakthroughs. Many people wanted to seize the opportunity to change their lives.

Qin Yu walked on the street. After thinking about it, he finally decided to go to the desolate grave where he had met man with the mustache.

Although the dark energy there was dense, it was indeed too dangerous. Most importantly, no one knew when there would be a strange movement inside. This could easily lead to an unstable state of mind, which would affect his cultivation.

However, since things had come to this, Qin Yu had no other way.

Yongji would arrive at the South Province in a month, so Qin Yu could not escape.

Therefore, Qin Yu did not waste any time. He immediately summoned the Divine Eagle and rushed toward the barren grave.

The barren grave.

This place was still barren.

The great changes in the world did not seem to bring a glimmer of hope to this place.

Qin Yu rushed all the way to the vicinity of the barren grave. When he arrived, he found that someone had already arrived here.

And that person was none other than man with the mustache, whom he had not seen for a long time!

At that moment, man with the mustache was standing near the barren grave, scratching his ears and cheeks. From time to time, he would touch his chin, and from time to time, he would scratch his hair.

Qin Yu stretched out a strand of divine sense, wanting to check the strength of man with the mustache.

However, man with the mustache was extremely vigilant. The Moment Qin Yu’s divine sense approached, he directly cut off this strand of divine sense!

“Who!”

The Mustache Man with the mustache suddenly turned around and looked at Qin Yu who was behind him.

“F * ck, it’s You, you bastard. You scared me,”the Mustache Man with the Mustache Man cursed.

Qin Yu walked to the Mustache Man with the mustache man and said, “I should be the one to say this. Where have you been all this time?”

“Of course, I’m busy with a big business!”The Mustache Man with the Mustache Man said proudly.

Qin Yu took a look at the dark energy grave and said, “What did you find here?”

Man with the mustache rolled his eyes, “You can be considered one of us. I Won’t hide it from you. The world has changed greatly. Normally, an ordinary dark energy grave would definitely be affected, so I specially rushed here to investigate this big grave.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Then what did you find?”

“This dark energy grave isn’t affected at all. This means that this grave is more precious than I imagined,”man with the mustache said greedily.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but think of Xiao Sheng’s words.

He said that the grave of the great cultivator who had transcended the tribulation, the tomb of the emperor, and a corner of the ancient battlefield were very difficult to be affected.

Now that this grave wasn’t affected, wasn’t it one of the three situations?

“Then why aren’t you going in?”Qin Yu said half-jokingly and half-seriously.

Man with the mustache rolled his eyes at Qin Yu and said, “I tried, but failed. If I enter rashly, 99% of me will die inside.”

“Even you can’t enter?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but be a little surprised.

“Nonsense! Do you think I’m Omnipotent?”Man with the mustache rolled his eyes.

Qin Yu laughed. “Then let’s wait and think of a way.”

“Sigh.”Man with the mustache let out a long sigh.

“I can sense it, and so can the others. If I’m not one step ahead of them, I’m afraid I won’t be able to keep up with the heat.”Man with the mustache shook his head.

Qin Yu agreed with man with the mustache. Although man with the mustache didn’t seem simple, he wasn’t powerful enough. In the entire holy region, there were too many people who could threaten him.

“Oh, right. Where’s the treasure you took from this tomb? We agreed to split it fifty-fifty.”Qin Yu suddenly remembered.

Man with the mustache immediately stuttered for a long time, unable to speak.

Just as Qin Yu was about to open his mouth, man with the mustache suddenly sniffed and asked, “There seems to be a strange smell on your body.”

“There is no smell,”Qin Yu said with a guilty conscience.

The Mustache Man with the mustache ignored Qin Yu. He surrounded Qin Yu and sniffed around. Then, he grabbed Qin Yu’s spatial magic artifact and said, “I smell a treasure. And this treasure is not simple.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but roll his eyes and said, “Are you a dog’s Nose?”

Man with the mustache grabbed Qin Yu’s spatial magic artifact and said with a smile, “Take it out and have a look. Don’t worry, I don’t want it. I don’t need that Little Babe.”

“What are you looking at?”Qin Yu rolled his eyes.

Man with the Mustache Smiled embarrassedly. “I’m just curious. I just want to have a look. Good brother, please satisfy my curiosity.”

Then, man with the mustache rubbed against Qin Yu’s body, which was extremely wretched.

Qin Yu really can not stand his this posture, had to tell him the truth.

Qin Yu looked at the man with the mustache and said in a low voice, “It’s dragon blood.”

“Dragon’s blood? What Dragon’s blood?”Man with the mustache was startled.

Qin Yu said in a low voice, “Dragon Burial Cave, the blood of the Dragon God.”

Man with the mustache was startled at first, then widened his eyes.

He grabbed Qin Yu’s arm tightly and said anxiously, “Do you have the dragon’s blood in your hand? Have you been to the Dragon’s burial cave? where is it?”

At this moment, man with the mustache was extremely excited. It was no exaggeration to say that Qin Yu had never seen him this excited!

“It is indeed the dragon’s blood from the Dragon Burial Cave.”Qin Yu nodded slightly.

As for the other questions, Qin Yu did not answer.

Man with the mustache said anxiously, “Quickly take it out and let me take a look. I will help you see if it is really dragon’s blood.”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “No need. I’m sure it’s Dragon Blood.”

Man with the mustache saw that it was impossible to force him, so he said with a fawning face, “Just let me take a look. I Promise I’ll just take a look, okay?”

“No,”Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said.

“Okay, don’t waste my time. I’m going to cultivate. The dark energy here is a holy object for me to cultivate.”

Man with the mustache quickly pulled Qin Yu back. He rolled his eyes and said, “As long as you give me a drop of dragon blood, I can find a better place for you. What do you think?”

Qin Yu was delighted. This kid really fell for it.

However, Qin Yu was not in a hurry. He still shook his head and said, “That’s it? I don’t need it.”

Qin Yu knew that man with the mustache had a bunch of treasures in his hands. It would be unreasonable if he didn’t trick him this time.

“Hey, don’t be anxious!”Man with the Mustache Pulled Qin Yu. His eyes rolled around, and then he said with a smile, “How about this, I’ll give you another treasure, how about it?”

“Oh? What Treasure?”Qin Yu tried to ask.

Man with the mustache took out a palm-sized bronze speaker.

The speaker looked ordinary, and it was hard to see what was unique about it.

“You took out a piece of scrap metal to fool me?”Qin Yu said unhappily.

Man with the mustache widened his eyes and said, “You said this is scrap metal? Do you know the origin of this thing?”
