Chapter 805: Chapter 805, heading to the mystic realm Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The two of them quickly bowed and said, “We didn’t mean that.”

“Then get lost!”Granny Qin said coldly.

After saying this, Granny Qin turned around and left with Qin Yu.

But at this moment, Qin Yu suddenly stretched out his palm and slapped the two of them on the head, directly breaking their heads!

Granny Qin’s expression immediately changed greatly when she saw this!

She angrily said, “What are you doing!”

Qin Yu said with a cold face, “If they spread the news, all their efforts will be for naught.”

“You!”Granny Qin gritted her teeth. Although she was unhappy, there was nothing she could do for Blacky.

Then, Qin Yu used the spiritual fire to burn the two people’s bodies. He followed behind Granny Qin and continued to move forward.

The Jingdu martial arts association was extremely large. There were at least dozens of houses inside.

Along the way, Qin Yu met many martial marquises.

Finally, after more than half an hour, Granny Qin finally stopped.

This was an empty space.

Qin Yu slightly closed his eyes, looking for the connection with the mystic realm.

Very quickly, Qin Yu discovered that there were many mystic realms nearby.

“Have we arrived?”Qin Yu looked at Granny Qin.

Granny Qin snorted, “This is the place.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and suppressed the excitement in his heart. He said, “Then don’t waste time. Hurry up.”

Granny Qin didn’t say much. She closed her eyes slightly and murmured something.

Rays of light began to appear in front of her.

Qin Yu’s eyes were fixed on Granny Qin, trying to find a way to open this mystic realm.

Unfortunately, the sound from her mouth was so soft that even Qin Yu couldn’t hear it clearly.

“Buzz!”

At this moment, rays of light suddenly flashed in front of Granny Qin!

The light was extremely bright. In a moment, a round entrance appeared in front of them.

This was the entrance to the mystic realm!

“Alright.”Granny Qin said coldly.

Qin Yu did not dare to waste time. Without saying anything, he immediately drilled into the mystic realm.

Just as Qin Yu’s palm reached into it, the entrance in front of him suddenly disappeared!

“How could this be!”Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed!

Granny Qin’s expression was also somewhat ugly! She seemed to have realized something, and immediately knelt on the ground with a plop!

A moment later, a figure actually appeared in front of the two of them!

This person looked to be the same age as Granny Qin, and the overbearing aura on his body made people not dare to ignore him!

“Granny Qin, how could you do such a Thing?”The old man said coldly.

Granny Qin said somewhat painfully, “Blackie is in his hands. I. . . I have no way...”

The old man frowned slightly and snorted coldly. “Don’t you know what this second secret realm means to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association? !”

Granny Qin said somewhat painfully, “I know, but I don’t want to give up on Blackie...”

The Old Man’s face was cold, and his gaze fell on Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s eyes also narrowed slightly. He sneered, “You are a high-level official of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?”

The old man coldly said, “Qin Yu, I advise you to stop now.”

“What if I don’t?”Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said.

The old man sneered, “Then you will probably get yourself killed.”

“Hehe, your Jingdu martial arts association has chased and killed me many times, but in the end, am I still alive and well?”Qin Yu said with slight ridicule.

The old man narrowed his eyes and said, “Qin Yu, don’t think that your insignificant achievements can threaten the JINGDU martial arts association...”

“I can go to your mother,”Qin Yu sneered.

The Old Man’s face turned cold and said, “Do you know who you are talking to!”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “If I’m not wrong, your strength should be very strong, beyond imagination.”

“But... you shouldn’t be able to make a move, right?”

“What kind of power is restricting you?”

Hearing that, the old man’s brows furrowed even more tightly.

“Looks like I’m right.”Seeing his expression, Qin Yu sneered.

The old man said coldly, “If I can make a move, killing you is like stepping on an ant.”

“I don’t want to listen to your nonsense. You’d better scram quickly.”Qin Yu stretched out his palm and directly crushed the Phantom!

Granny Qin, who was kneeling on the ground, was shocked!

She raised her head and glared at Qin Yu, saying, “Do you know who he is! ?”

“What does it have to do with me who he is?”Qin Yu sneered.

Granny Qin gritted her teeth and got up from the ground. Then she took a deep breath and said, “Give little black back to me.”

“Give it back to you?”Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

“I didn’t enter this mystic realm. Why should I give him back to you?”

Granny Qin gritted her teeth and said, “Qin Yu! I’ve done my best. Don’t go too far!”

“Then you should continue to think of ways. Before I enter this mystic realm, I won’t give Blackie back to you,”Qin Yu said indifferently.

“You!”Granny Qin was instantly furious. The killing intent on her body also exploded.

Qin Yu mocked, “What, do you want to fight me? You should know that you are not my match. Save it, don’t break your old bones.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and left.

Granny Qin looked at Qin Yu’s back. Although she was extremely angry, she was helpless.

Qin Yu turned around and walked out of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

After Qin Yu left, Granny Qin’s phone quickly rang.

She didn’t even need to think to know that it was a call from the higher-ups.

After the call was connected, a cold voice came from the other end, “Meeting.”

...

After Qin Yu left, he went straight back to his residence.

As soon as he entered, the handlebar mustache ran over excitedly.

“How was it? Did you go in?”The handlebar mustache seemed to be even more excited than Qin Yu.

The reason he stayed in Jingdu was for the secret realm. Now that Qin Yu had entered the second secret realm, he was naturally excited.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No, I was discovered.”

The handlebar mustache was stunned. He frowned and said, “That shouldn’t be. Looking at your expression, you don’t look like you were discovered. Instead, you look relaxed.”

Qin Yu leaned back on the rocking chair and said with a faint smile, “That’s right. I’ve long guessed that this trip would definitely be discovered.”

“Then why are you still going?”The Mustache Man said with a frown.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “The reason why I’m going is for three purposes.”

“First, I want to explore the power of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

“Second, I want to find the location of the second secret realm. As long as I find the location, I’ll have a way to save Ruoxue.”

“Third... I want to confirm some of my ideas.”
