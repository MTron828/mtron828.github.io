Chapter 804: Chapter 804. Granny Qin agreed Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

At this moment, Granny Qin was sitting on the blanket at home, heartbroken.

Her weathered face was filled with tears. Her white hair hung in front of her forehead, and she actually looked a little pitiful.

“It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have let you fight with that Qin Yu...”Granny Qin’s tears flowed freely as she muttered in a low voice.

At this moment, Granny Qin suddenly wiped her tears. Her eyes became a little more determined, as if she had made a decision.

“I can only hide the news for now.”Granny Qin had the intention of going all out.

She decided not to tell this news to the higher-ups for now. Instead, she would secretly bring Qin Yu to the secret realm before the higher-ups found out!

Because Granny Qin knew very well that to the higher-ups, Blackie’s and her own lives were not worth mentioning!

They would definitely not expose the secret of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association for Blackie’s Sake!

“I’ve worked for the Jingdu Martial Arts Association all my life, and now it’s time for me to receive a corresponding reward.”

“For Blacky’s sake, I can only do this!”

Granny Qin muttered in a low voice. Then, she turned around and walked out of the house.

At night.

Qin Yu sat in the rented house, and he couldn’t help but feel a little worried.

The Mustache Man, on the other hand, was quite relaxed. He was grilling while humming a tune.

“You don’t say. Living in a bungalow like this is much more comfortable than living in that building.”The man with the handlebar moustache muttered.

After he had finished speaking, he took the roasted meat skewer and handed it over to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu shook his head and sighed: “You go ahead and eat. I’m not in the mood.”

The man with the handlebar moustache rolled his eyes and said: “Forget it if you don’t want to eat.”

At this moment, the news of Qin Yu smashing a martial saint’s weapon with a single punch had already spread throughout the entire fire country’s martial arts world.

This was almost the first time in history that breaking a martial saint’s weapon at the level of a martial Marquis was unheard of.

Since the beginning of time, countless geniuses had appeared, but no one was able to achieve such a feat.

“There are so many geniuses in this world, who can be compared to Qin Yu?”In an instant, everyone ranked Qin Yu First!

Even the martial arts forum had changed the rankings.

Yan Jinyao, who had dominated the first place for many years, was now ranked second!

Looking at the news on the rankings, Yan Jinyao’s face became increasingly gloomy.

“The first... can only be mine!”Yan Jinyao’s eyes revealed a trace of viciousness.

...

In the early morning.

The entire world seemed to have fallen into a deep sleep, but Qin Yu did not feel sleepy at all.

He did not have much time, and the martial saint’s power could disappear at any time. It was impossible to say that he was not in a hurry.

“Could it be that she really wants to give up on Blacky?”Qin Yu could not help but frown.

At this moment.

Qin Yu’s phone rang.

He picked up the phone and saw that the caller was an unfamiliar number.

Qin Yu quickly picked up the phone. As soon as the call was connected, he heard the voice of Granny Qin on the other end.

“Qin Yu, state your conditions. What is it going to take for Blacky to be released?”Granny Qin said coldly.

Qin Yu sneered, “Granny Qin, I think I’ve made myself clear enough, right?”

Granny Qin was silent for a moment, then said coldly, “See you at Qinggang Mountain at eight o’clock tomorrow morning.”

After saying this, Granny Qin directly hung up the phone.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but let out a sigh of relief, and a trace of a smile appeared on his face.

“Finally... It’s a success,”Qin Yu murmured in a low voice. The huge rock hanging in his heart was finally lifted.

Qin Yu did not fall asleep the entire night. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The next morning, Qin Yu handed Blacky over to the handlebar mustache.

“Before I come back, you must keep an eye on him,”Qin Yu warned.

The handlebar mustache nodded and said, “Don’t worry.”

Qin Yu did not say anything more. He immediately rushed to Qinggang Mountain.

At eight o’clock in the morning.

Granny Qin appeared on time at Qinggang Mountain.

In just a short day, Granny Qin looked like she had aged dozens of years. She was extremely haggard.

“You’re finally here,”Qin Yu said indifferently.

Granny Qin looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Qin Yu, you’re Ruthless!”

“You didn’t ask me to come here to talk nonsense, right?”Qin Yu said coldly.

Granny Qin snorted coldly and said, “Where’s little black? Let me see him.”

“No.”Qin Yu rejected Granny Qin’s request without even thinking.

Granny qin frowned and said, “What? I can’t even see him once? Then why should I believe that he’s still safe?”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Did you let me see Yan Ruoxue back then?”

Granny Qin was stunned and suddenly had nothing to say.

“Don’t worry. Killing him won’t do me any good. You know better than me what my goal is,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Granny Qin didn’t say anything more. She threw a hat at Qin Yu and said, “Put this on.”

Qin Yu was very familiar with this person, and it was used to cover his face.

Qin Yu didn’t stand on ceremony and immediately put the hat on his head.

“When we get to the martial arts association, it’s best if you don’t say anything,”Granny Qin said coldly.

“Don’t worry,”Qin Yu said, suppressing the excitement in his heart.

Thus, the two of them immediately rushed to the martial arts association in Jingdu.

As they moved forward, the two of them finally arrived at the entrance of the martial arts association.

The entrance was still heavily guarded, and the atmosphere was solemn and solemn.

After Granny Qin appeared, the two guards at the entrance immediately bowed and said, “Greetings, Granny Qin.”

Granny Qin didn’t say a word and strode in.

Qin Yu followed closely behind. His eyes looked around, carefully observing everything around him.

After passing through the hall of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, they arrived at the back hall.

Behind the back hall, there were houses after houses.

This was the real Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

The moment he stepped into it, Qin Yu could feel a mysterious internal Qi permeating the entire space.

This was Qin Yu’s first time here. He carefully observed everything around him.

This included the buildings and the flow of people coming and going.

Because if he wanted to attack the Jingdu martial arts association, he had to understand the structure of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association and the power it possessed.

Along the way, Qin Yu discovered that there were still several mysterious powers hidden in the dark of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

The surrounding buildings were more like secret rooms. Each house hid a different secret.

Even the famous Scripture depository was set up here.

“Granny Qin.”

At this moment, two men walked forward. Good Granny Qin greeted them.

Granny Qin didn’t say a word and only nodded.

Just as she was about to bring Qin Yu forward, the two men suddenly asked, “Granny Qin, who is this person? Why haven’t we seen him before?”

Granny Qin coldly replied, “No need to ask. I want to bring him to the higher-ups.”

“This...”the two of them looked at each other and then said, “Granny Qin, you know this is a top-secret place. Outsiders are not allowed to enter.”

Granny Qin’s expression turned cold as she said with a sinister tone, “Why? Do I still need to report to you? Or are you suspecting me?”
