Chapter 407: I Don’t Care Who She Is! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Guan Jiarong?” Fang Yue had obviously heard of this name before.

She glanced at Qin Yu and said in a low voice, “Guan Jiarong is indeed the president of the Jiang Bei Martial Arts Association. His position isn’t low.”

Qin Yu ignored Fang Yue’s words and looked at the young man while saying coldly, “Get lost immediately.”

Displeasure flashed across the young man’s face. He pointed at Qin Yu and said, “Kid, are you tired of living? Your partner wants to cheat on you, so I helped you. You should thank me!”

Qin Yu slowly stood up.

“What? You want to make a move?” The young man snorted coldly.

“Let me tell you, I am an Inner Strength Past Master!” A weak internal qi burst out from the young man’s body.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He just took a step forward.

A terrifying pressure immediately spread out!

“Bang!”

Under this huge pressure, the young man fell to the ground, while his face was bruised and swollen!

“Go back and tell Guan Jiarong that I have one more grudge with him. Let him think about how to solve it,” Qin Yu said coldly.

After saying this, Qin Yu pulled Fang Yue up and turned around to leave.

After they walked away, Fang Yue said in surprise, “You know Guan Jiarong?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “In a sense. Small world.”

Then, Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Let’s not talk about this anymore. Miss Fang, go back and think about it carefully, then give me an answer.”

Fang Yue smiled and said, “Okay, Mr. Qin, don’t worry.”

...

At this moment, smoke was bellowing in Qin Yu’s residence.

Ever since Taozi left the Divine Alchemist Pavilion with Qin Yu, she had been researching pills at home.

Qin Yu didn’t disappoint her. He gave her several kinds of pill formulas.

Each of these pill formulas was priceless.

Taozi naturally wouldn’t miss this opportunity. Almost every day, she would refine pills until she was exhausted.

“Wow, your technique isn’t up to standards. Mr. Qin can refine this kind of pill with a lift of his finger.” Yao Qing stood beside Taozi as he mocked and ridiculed her.

Taozi glared at Yao Qing and said, “Elder Qin knows how to refine, but what has it got to do with you? What are you so smug about?!”

“Of course I’m smug! I’m even proud of him!” Yao Qing said shamelessly.

At this moment, an Audi A8 with a Jingdu license plate slowly stopped at the door.

Then, a graceful and noble lady walked out of the car.

She was surrounded by a few bodyguards, each of whom had a respectful expression.

The mighty formation made Yao Qing and Taozi frown.

They had come with ill intentions.

This was the first thought in their minds.

“Who are you looking for?” Yao Qing took the lead and asked nervously.

The noblewoman sized up Yao Qing and said indifferently, “Where’s Qin Yu?”

“Mr. Qin has gone out and isn’t at home. Who are you?” Yao Qing asked.

“How dare you! This is the madam of the Yan family, Zhang Yin!” The bodyguard next to him immediately shouted angrily!

The madam of the Yan family?

Yao Qing and Taozi’s expressions couldn’t help but change.

Everyone knew about the enmity between Qin Yu and the Yan family. Now that the madam of the Yan family was here personally, something big was going to happen!

“Mrs. Yan, Mr. Qin isn’t here. You’d better come back another day,” Yao Qing said in a deep voice.

As he spoke, Yao Qing took out his phone to secretly inform Qin Yu to run away.

But unfortunately, this action didn’t escape Zhang Yin’s eyes.

“Bang!”

A burst of internal qi flashed past, and Yao Qing’s phone was shattered. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“You want to inform him?” Zhang Yin said with a halfhearted smile.

Although Yao Qing usually acted flippant, in critical situations, he definitely wouldn’t shirk his responsibility and escape.

Yao Qing gritted his teeth and said coldly, “Mrs. Yan, Mr. Qin has really gone out. You should leave.”

Zhang Yin snorted and said, “If he doesn’t come back, I will wait for him here.”

After saying that, Zhang Yin strode into the courtyard.

Yao Qing immediately stood in front of Zhang Yin.

He braced himself and said, “Mrs. Yan, Mr. Qin, he...”

“Get lost,” Zhang Yin said coldly.

“Why should he get lost? You should be the one to get lost!” Taozi said with a cold expression.

Zhang Yin’s gaze immediately landed on Taozi’s face.

She raised her eyebrows and said, “Are you talking to me?”

“Who else? Could I be talking to the air?” Taozi snorted.

Zhang Yin’s eyes narrowed slightly.

She said indifferently, “You dare to talk back to me? Slap her!”

“Yes!”

The bodyguard beside Zhang Yin immediately walked towards Taozi!

Yao Qing tried to stop him, but he wasn’t a match at all.

The bodyguard waved his big hand and sent Yao Qing flying.

Then, the bodyguard reached out and grabbed Taozi’s body. He raised his hand and slapped Taozi’s face twice.

These two slaps were extremely powerful. Taozi’s mouth was covered in blood, and there was even a bloody scar on her face.

“How dare two dogs challenge me.” Zhang Yin snorted coldly.

“Make the two of them kneel at the door.” Zhang Yin ordered.

“Yes.” The bodyguard nodded.

Then, the bodyguard used a secret technique to suppress the bodies of the two people and made them kneel at the door!

Yao Qing and Taozi tried to struggle, but in front of the Inner Strength Grandmaster, they couldn’t fight back at all! They could only kneel at the door!

Zhang Yin walked into Qin Yu’s home.

She looked at the decorations in Qin Yu’s home and couldn’t help but snort. “What a country bumpkin. How lame and shabby.”

Zhang Yin seemed to be extremely disgusted with Qin Yu’s residence.

She even felt that it was demeaning to even sit down.

In Zhang Yin’s eyes, this reflected the lower class’ poverty. It was extremely disgusting.

As time passed, Zhang Yin paced back and forth in Qin Yu’s house.

About half an hour later, Qin Yu’s car finally appeared in the distance.

“Elder Qin is back.” Taozi was the first to see the car.

Yao Qing’s expression changed. He hurriedly shouted in Qin Yu’s direction, “Mr. Qin, run!”

Hearing Yao Qing’s words, Qin Yu, who was in the car, couldn’t help but frown slightly.

When he saw the two people kneeling at the door, his expression changed! He immediately stepped on the accelerator and rushed over!

The car stopped steadily in front of Yao Qing.

Qin Yu hurriedly jumped out of the car and said coldly, “Who did it?”

Yao Qing didn’t answer, but anxiously said, “Mr. Qin, run quickly. Someone from the Yan family has come!”

“Yan family?” Qin Yu’s expression instantly became even colder.

Just as Qin Yu was about to step in, Yao Qing anxiously shouted, “Mr. Qin, the person who came this time is different. She... she is the madam of the Yan family!”

“I don’t care who she is. Just because she is the madam of the Yan family, she thinks she can do whatever she wants to me?” Qin Yu said coldly.
