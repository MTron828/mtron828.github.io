Chapter 1432: Chapter 1,432, there’s no one I don’t dare to kill

Fang Fang saw this and didn’t say anything more.

He didn’t know what Qin Yu was planning, but for some reason, when he saw Qin Yu’s extremely conceited expression, he felt inexplicably at ease.

Time passed by minute by minute, and the battle continued.

Qin Yu just looked at them coldly without any intention of attacking.

Mo Rong and the others were not worried that Qin Yu would snatch them away. After all, in their eyes, the strength of these people was not worth worrying about.

They were struggling to deal with the flying spider. With their abilities, there was no way they could kill the flying spider in one strike. They could only slowly grind it to death.

Under the joint attack of the few of them, the aura of the flying spider began to become unstable. It seemed to be showing signs of decline.

“Everyone, put in more effort and strive to kill this flying spider in One Breath!”Mo Rong shouted.

Qin Yu narrowed her eyes and clenched her fists, ready to attack at any time.

Seeing the flying spider being beaten back repeatedly, just as they were about to give the flying spider a final blow, Qin Yu suddenly shot out!

A golden light tore through the void and instantly arrived in front of the flying spider!

The sun-like fist directly smashed towards the flying spider’s head.

With a bang, the flying spider’s head directly exploded!

With just one strike, the flying spider immediately fell to the ground and its life force was rapidly fading away.

Mo Rong and the others’expressions changed and they immediately shouted angrily, “Brat, what are you doing! ?”

Qin Yu sneered, “What? I killed the flying spider, so the thing is naturally mine. I saved your lives, so you should be grateful to me, right?”

Mo Rong was speechless by Qin Yu’s words. He opened his mouth, but was unable to say anything for a moment.

“Kid, we went through so much effort and almost killed the flying spider, but you made a move at this time. Do you have any shame?”The person beside Mo Rong shouted.

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said, “Do you think this kind of behavior is very shameless?”

“It’s not just shameless, it’s simply a beast’s behavior!”Mo Rong’s companion continued to shout loudly.

Qin Yu laughed loudly and said, “You’re right, you’re right! Mo Rong, what do you think?”

Mo Rong’s face was livid. He looked coldly at Qin Yu and said, “Kid, I advise you not to find fault with me. Otherwise, not only will you get nothing, but you will also die here today.”

“Is that so? I want to see what you can do,”Qin Yu said with a sneer.

Mo Rong immediately flew into a rage and said, “You are courting death!”

With that, Mo Rong directly slammed his palm toward Qin Yu!

Qin Yu looked coldly at Mo Rong. Just as his palm was about to Touch Qin Yu, Qin Yu suddenly made a move and grabbed Mo Rong’s wrist.

Mo Rong’s face changed. He tried to struggle, but found that he could not escape at all.

“What? You Can’t stand the fact that I used the things you’ve done on You?”Qin Yu loosened his grip. Mo Rong immediately staggered back a few steps and finally sat down on the ground.

Such humiliation made Mo Rong even angrier.

His palm shook, and he pulled out the sword again. Then he pointed at Qin Yu and said, “Kid, you’re heating up the wrong person. I’ll send you to Hell Right Now!”

After saying that, Mo Rong held the sword in his hand and stabbed straight at Qin Yu!

Qin Yu sneered. He stretched out two fingers and caught Mo Rong’s sword.

Mo Rong’s face changed. Before he could say anything, the sword in his hand was broken into two pieces by Qin Yu!

“Is that all you got?”Qin Yu looked at Mo Rong coldly.

Mo Rong realized that something was wrong. He took two steps back and said coldly, “Who the hell are you!”

Qin Yu shook his arm and sneered, “I won’t change my name or surname. My name is Qin Yu, how about it?”

“Qin Yu? !”

As soon as he said that, everyone’s expression changed drastically!

Fang Fang and the others who were not far away were even more shocked!

This young man who looked amiable was actually Qin Yu? !

“You... You Are Qin Yu? How... How is this possible? !”Mo Rong’s expression was extremely ugly.

Qin Yu’s feet shook, and he instantly appeared in front of Mo Rong.

“Why can’t I Be Qin Yu?”Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said.

Mo Rong gritted his teeth. In front of so many people, he braced himself and shouted, “So what if you are Qin Yu? I, Mo Rong, Am Not Afraid of You!”

Qin Yu said coldly, “I don’t need you to be afraid of me. Anyway, you are a person who is about to die.”

Mo Rong’s body tightened. He said with a trembling voice, “I... I don’t believe that you dare to kill me!”

Qin Yu laughed loudly and said, “There is no one in this world that I don’t dare to kill!”

After saying that, Qin Yu directly stretched out his hand and smashed Mo Rong’s head into pieces with a slap!

Mo Rong did not even feel any pain before he directly died here.

Looking at Mo Rong’s corpse on the ground, the people around could not help but show terrified expressions.

Qin Yu reached out and took out the inner pellet from Mo Rong’s pocket, then walked to Fang.

“This belongs to you. Take it back.”Qin Yu handed the inner pellet to Fang.

Fang was stunned. He stood there in a daze, not knowing what to do for a moment.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com
