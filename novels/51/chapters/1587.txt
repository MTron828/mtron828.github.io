Chapter 1588: Chapter 1,588, Xiao Yu made her move Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

These black-robed men carried an extremely powerful internal Qi.

They walked out from the void, clearly borrowing the teleportation formation of the northern lands.

After the two godly monarchs returned to the northern lands, they immediately ordered others to chase after Qin Yu. Now, they happened to find traces of Qin Yu here.

Looking at these black-robed men in front of him, Qin Yu could not help but frown slightly.

He said coldly, “Why? Did your godly monarch escape on his own and send all of you here to die?”

“Escape? The godly monarch only has important matters to attend to. Otherwise, do you think you can live to this day?”One of the black-robed men said coldly.

“That’s right. The godly monarch specially sent us here to bring you back. Are you going to follow us of your own accord, or do you want us to cripple you before bringing you back?”

Qin Yu sneered, “Just the few of you? You can come and try!”

After saying that, Qin Yu looked at Xiao Yu and said, “Wait for me at the side first.”

Xiao Yu remained silent and only looked at Qin Yu coldly.

Qin Yu did not care about Xiao Yu anymore. These black-robed men were extremely powerful. If they were distracted for even a moment, it was very likely that they would die here.

However, the gazes of the black-robed men fell on Xiao Yu.

“HM? Who Is this woman? She seems a little strange,”said one of the black-robed men.

“Her body... has an extremely unique internal Qi.”The other black-robed man took a step forward.

Then, they looked at each other and immediately shouted, “Little girl, are you interested in returning to the northern lands with us?”

Xiao Yu remained silent as usual.

“HMM? Mute?”The black-robed man frowned.

Then, he walked towards Xiao Yu and grabbed her shoulder.

“Xiao Yu!”

Qin Yu’s expression changed when he saw this scene!

He was about to move forward, but what happened next stunned Qin Yu!

Xiao Yu lifted her palm lightly and slapped the black-robed man’s head.

Before the black-robed man could react, his entire body was crushed and exploded!

All of Xiao Yu’s internal Qi flowed into her body through her palm!

Seeing this scene, many of the black-robed men in the northern lands were instantly enraged!

“You’re courting death!”They shouted loudly and rushed towards Xiao Yu!

Xiao Yu stood there motionlessly. Just as these black-robed men were moving forward, her body emitted an extremely resplendent and overbearing internal Qi!

“Boom!”

The moment they came into contact, the black-robed men were all pushed back, their bodies almost shattering!

“You...”the black-robed man raised his hand and pointed at Xiao Yu, his face filled with terror.

Before she could speak, Xiao Yu had already lightly slapped her.

“Boom!”

Her crystalline palm covered the earth, like a ray of Sunset falling from the sky, enveloping everything.

These black-robed men were instantly smashed into meat paste, even their bones were shattered.

Qin Yu could not help but gulp, staring at Xiao Yu with a dumbfounded expression.

These black-robed men were extremely powerful. Although they were not as strong as the godly kings of the northern lands, they were definitely not ordinary people!

But now, they were all killed by Xiao Yu with a slap. What kind of strength was this?

“This... the rate of improvement is much faster than mine...”Qin Yu could not help but mutter in a low voice.

One had to know that Xiao Yu had been on the path of cultivation for even less time than Qin Yu! Although it was very likely that she was reincarnated, this speed was a little too fast!

Even an existence like Xiao Hai would not be able to do this!

“Give me the thing.”

Finally, Xiao Yu spoke.

Qin Yu was stunned and said, “What Thing?”

Xiao Yu pointed at Qin Yu’s spatial magic artifact.

Before Qin Yu could say anything, the divine picture floated out of the spatial magic artifact and landed in Xiao Yu’s hand.

“Xiao Yu, you can’t take this away from me!”Qin Yu immediately became anxious!

This divine picture was Qin Yu’s only trump card. If he lost this item, he would definitely encounter a great enemy in the future!

However, Xiao Yu ignored Qin Yu and turned around to leave.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and quickly chased after her.

At this moment, Xiao Yu turned around and gave Qin Yu a cold glance.

Her eyes contained an extremely strong killing intent.

This killing intent could not help but cause Qin Yu to be startled and break out in cold sweat!

That look in her eyes was definitely not an act. At this moment, Xiao Yu’s killing intent had probably really risen!

Fortunately, the killing intent in her eyes was quickly suppressed.

Her figure floated over and stood in front of Qin Yu.

The current Xiao Yu had an extremely perfect figure. In fact, she was even slightly taller than Qin Yu.

In addition to the powerful internal Qi on her body, even Qin Yu’s aura was a head shorter.

“Early-stage mighty figure...”Xiao Yu whispered about Qin Yu’s cultivation. Then, she saw the token hanging on Qin Yu’s chest.

“Before you enter the return to void stage, don’t go to the Central Plains, and don’t come into contact with the Yan family,”Xiao Yu said quietly.

Qin Yu was stunned and hurriedly asked, “Why?”

Xiao Yu didn’t answer. She turned around and stepped into the void. In the blink of an eye, she disappeared without a trace. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Qin Yu felt extremely uncomfortable. He didn’t know why, but the Xiao Yu in front of him felt very unfamiliar.

It seemed like what the Mustache Man with the mustache said was right. Once Xiao Yu completely awakened, it was very likely that she would forget about him.

“Reversion void stage...”Qin Yu muttered softly.

The current Qin Yu was only at the early-stage of the Almighty Realm. How could it be so easy for him to step into the reversion void stage.

For the Holy Region, even a genius would need more than a hundred years to step into the reversion void stage.

Even a monster would need at least a few decades, and this was under the premise that the clan would pour in resources.

However, Xiao Yu did not need to lie to her. Since she said it, it must have made sense.

Just as Qin Yu’s thoughts were running wild, a bracelet that was flashing with five-colored light fell in front of Qin Yu.

“HMM?”Qin Yu was stunned and quickly grabbed the bracelet.

The bracelet looked extremely ordinary, very much like an ordinary bracelet bought at a roadside stall.

However, this ordinary bracelet emitted an extremely mysterious internal Qi.

Qin Yu sniffed it. Yes, it was Xiao Yu’s internal Qi, and even... There was a hint of body fragrance.

“This is the magical artifact that Xiao Yu left for me?”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Qin Yu played with the magical artifact and said in a low voice, “She took away the divine picture. This should be my compensation...”

He was not in a hurry to study this bracelet, but kept it in his bag.

Ever since he saw Xiao Yu, Qin Yu had suffered a great blow.

The difference in strength was still hard to accept.

In addition to Xiao Yu’s last words, it made Qin Yu even more anxious.

“Reversion void stage...”Qin Yu murmured softly as he walked back.

...

The northern lands.

In the cold ancestral hall, there were a few tokens.

At this moment, in the ancestral hall, a total of eight tokens were shattered.

“Eh?”

Seeing this scene, the faces of the people in the ancestral hall changed slightly.

“Eight venerables... are dead?”
