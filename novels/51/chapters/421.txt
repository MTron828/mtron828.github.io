Chapter 422: You Seem to Have Forgotten My Identity Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Boom!

Countless resplendent rays of light exploded on Qin Yu’s body!

These were all the trump cards of peak Inner Strength Grandmasters. No matter how strong Qin Yu’s physical body was, he wouldn’t be able to endure them!

His physical body was ruthlessly smashed into the ground, and the large saber brushed past Qin Yu’s body and flew over!

“Seize the opportunity to stop him!” Someone said with a cold snort.

Chains suddenly appeared around Qin Yu.

These chains were made of the purest inner strength, and they bound Qin Yu’s limbs, making him unable to move!

Qin Yu, who was already heavily injured, was unable to struggle at this moment!

“Swoosh!”

The skeleton once again raised its saber and slashed viciously at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s expression was somewhat unsightly. He tried to struggle, but he discovered that the chains had imprisoned him so tightly that he was unable to move!

“Slash!”

The large saber landed solidly on Qin Yu’s body!

The golden light lingering around Qin Yu’s body shattered in that instant! However, this did not stop the large saber’s advance!

Updates by

The black saber slashed at Qin Yu’s chest.

A bloody wound appeared in front of everyone’s eyes!

“Pu!”

The huge impact made Qin Yu spit out a mouthful of blood!

“Ah!!”

At this moment, Qin Yu raised his head and let out an angry roar. A terrifying force instantly erupted!

The chains that were imprisoning his body were instantly shattered! Light erupted beneath his feet. His killing intent surged, and his fighting spirit was overflowing!

“He actually managed to break free,” someone said coldly.

“He’s already an arrow at the end of its flight. He won’t be able to hold on for much longer.”

“Everyone, strike while the iron is hot. Don’t give him any chance.”

Everyone looked at each other and came to an agreement.

Qin Yu, who was in mid-air, had an incomparably grave expression.

He didn’t expect that this battle would be so difficult.

“If I don’t get rid of this skeleton, I have no chance of winning today,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Swish!”

Qin Yu flipped his palm and a bronze sword fell into his hand.

“Before I left the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, I comprehended a sword technique,” Qin Yu whispered.

“It was originally intended to deal with Han Wei, but I didn’t expect it to come in handy so quickly.”

With the bronze sword in hand, Qin Yu’s eyes showed a resolute look.

A trace of blood essence flew out from Qin Yu’s glabella and landed on the bronze sword. In an instant, the bronze sword flickered with a demonic light!

This light wasn’t strong, but it was exceptionally eye-catching. No one could look away!

“Come on, let me see if you, a skeleton, can dodge the heaven-ranked sword technique left by my father,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The skeleton seemed to understand Qin Yu’s words. He waved his saber and slashed at Qin Yu again!

“First slash of the Nine Taiqing Slashes!”

Qin Yu held his sword with both hands, and a terrifying sword light burst out at this moment!

The demonic light rolled over with omnipotent power!

Qin Yu’s blood was burning, and his fighting spirit was soaring. The powerful demonic sword light slashed at the skeleton!

“Clang!”

The swords and sabers collided, and a brilliant spark burst out!

The giant skeleton’s body actually took a few steps back!

“It really works.” Qin Yu laughed coldly.

The Nine Taiqing Slashes was a true heaven rank saint spell. It was said that when cultivated to the extreme, it could split the earth!

However, Qin Yu could only make a second slash, so he didn’t dare to waste time.

“Everyone, hurry up and attack. If this skeleton falls, we won’t have a chance!” Someone shouted anxiously.

Everyone once again activated their spells and prepared to launch a fatal attack on Qin Yu!

Qin Yu looked at them coldly and muttered in a low voice, “I must finish off this skeleton as soon as possible!”

As he spoke, the light of the bronze sword increased by another three feet!

“Nine Taiqing Slashes, second slash!” Qin Yu raised his head and roared angrily. All the spiritual power seemed to have been injected into the bronze sword at this moment!

The blood-red sword light seemed to come from the sky as its monstrous power shook the entire ground!

The small mountain not far away was directly bombarded into flat ground. Even if someone was several miles away, they could still see this bizarre scene!

“Slash!”

The sword light landed on the skeleton’s body. Like cutting tofu, it slashed across its entire body!

The pitch-black skeleton began to shatter at this moment before turning into endless black energy and disappearing into the sky.

Qin Yu’s internal qi also became somewhat weakened.

With his current strength, he had already done his best to block the second sword attack.

Elder Zhuo’s body fell straight down.

In a short while, he turned into dust and disappeared from this world.

The crowd was silent.

Everyone felt a trace of unease.

“Everyone, don’t worry. He is already exhausted. As long as we attack together, killing him isn’t a problem,” someone said anxiously.

Even though that was the case, Qin Yu’s almost invincible prowess left a trace of trauma in their hearts.

In the air, Qin Yu stared coldly at these people.

The monstrous killing intent on his body did not subside at all.

“Qin Yu, we can let you live today.” Someone started to back out.

Once someone was discouraged, the fighting spirit of the others would be instantly dampened.

“That’s right, we don’t want to kill you, because you’re talented.”

“Maybe we’ll be able to witness your peak in the future.”

Qin Yu looked at these people coldly and grinned. “I’m sorry, but I don’t want to let you guys go.”

As soon as he said that, the atmosphere at the scene immediately became extremely tense.

“Qin Yu, we’re kind enough to let you live. Don’t be ungrateful!” Someone shouted angrily.

Qin Yu, who was in midair, couldn’t help but raise his head and laugh loudly.

His laughter echoed throughout the valley and shook people’s ears until they felt pain.

“What... What are you laughing at?!” His laughter stirred up uneasiness and someone couldn’t help but roar to hide the fear in his heart.

Qin Yu said coldly, “Opportunities and risks often coexist. For me, for the sake of opportunities, I can bear the risks. What about you guys?”

Everyone was stunned and asked in confusion, “You... What do you mean?”

“I mean... you all have to die today.”

As soon as Qin Yu finished speaking, his body suddenly disappeared.

In the next second, a round sun-like fist approached with immense momentum!

This was the peak of Qin Yu’s Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist. Thousands of waves stirred up on the surface of the water ! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Oh no, run quickly!”

Some people saw that things weren’t good and hurriedly ran away.

Under the surging might of the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist, there were still people who could not escape and were smashed into meat paste by this punch!

Qin Yu pursued and attacked with lethalness

His spiritual power was almost depleted, but it was still unable to stop his surging killing intent!

In an instant, the riverside seemed to have become a purgatory on earth. Fresh blood flowed into the river water and dyed it red!

Everyone was scared out of their wits. Even if they fought back, they were still no match for Qin Yu.

“Pa!”

Qin Yu unleashed the Heaven Swallowing Technique to its extreme. With every palm raised, one person’s inner strength would be sucked dry!

This massacre continued from day to night until a full moon appeared in the sky. Only then did it come to an end.

Looking at the corpses, Qin Yu did not feel the slightest bit of pity.

It was as if he had gone mad, and he felt extremely excited!

However, the excitement in his heart couldn’t suppress his tiredness.

Qin Yu sat by the river and muttered in a low voice, “Eleven Inner Strength Grandmasters allowed me to reach the second level of the Enlightenment Stage. Absorbing Inner Strength Grandmasters is the fastest way.”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly sensed a person walking over from behind him.

“Mr. Qin’s skillS really shocked me.”

The person who spoke was none other than the Formation Master, Li Zinan.

During this period, he did not make a move. He only stood by the side and watched.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said coldly, “Since you didn’t make a move, I won’t kill you. You can leave.”

Li Zinan raised his eyebrows and said, “Then I have to thank you, Mr. Qin?”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything and ignored Li Zinan.

Li Zinan sneered and said, “Qin Yu, don’t tell me you think I’m some kind person.”

Qin Yu slowly stood up when he heard that.

He looked at Li Zinan and said, “What do you mean?”

Li Zinan laughed loudly and said, “To tell you the truth, I was just waiting! When you’re exhausted, I’ll break your dantian and take the Meridian Circulation Technique for myself!”

“You actually treat me as a good person? Should I call you naive or stupid?” Li Zinan raised his eyebrows and said.

Qin Yu looked at Li Zinan coldly and said, “Do you think you can kill me?”

Li Zinan snorted lightly and said, “If it was at your peak, I naturally wouldn’t be your opponent. But now... you’re already exhausted. You’re just a lamb at the mercy of others.”

Qin Yu looked Li Zinan up and down and sneered. “Did you think I didn’t notice you?”

Li Zinan frowned slightly and asked with confusion, “What do you mean?”

Qin Yu sneered. “Have you forgotten my identity as an Elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?”

As soon as he said that, Qin Yu took out a bunch of pills and stuffed them into his mouth, as if he was eating candy.
