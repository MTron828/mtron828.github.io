Wang Xiong looked at Qin Yu coldly, and the energy in his body surged as he strode over.

Above, Zhen Yue and the others looked extremely nervous.

“Sect Master Zhen, let’s leave before Wang Xiong comes up,” someone beside them advised.

“Yeah, it’ll be too late if we wait for Wang Xiong to come up!”

Zhen Yue gritted her teeth and said in a deep voice, “I can’t leave. I can’t give up on the Beaufort Tower.”

“Sect Master! It’s useless for you to stay. Wang Xiong is a half-step Martial Marquis, and he has the support of the Saint Confucian Sect!”

“Yeah! Instead of waiting for death, it’s better to leave for now and find another chance in the future!”

Zhen Yue’s expression was extremely ugly. She gritted her teeth and said unwillingly, “Maybe... This is the only way.”

However, at this moment, a huge explosion sounded from the water!

A huge wave rose from the water, and then a few people flew out like cannonballs!

These people were none other than Wang Xiong and the others!

At this moment, Wang Xiong’s mouth was bleeding, and his arm was broken. He looked miserable.

“What... What’s going on?” Zhen Yue was dumbfounded.

Wang Xiong didn’t say anything. He hurriedly got up from the ground and stared at the lake.

A moment later, a golden light lit up.

Qin Yu slowly walked out of the lake.

“It’s you!?” Zhen Yue was stunned when she saw Qin Yu.

Qin Yu glanced at Zhen Yue, then pointed at Wang Xiong and said, “He’s from Beaufort Tower? What the h*ll? He wants to fight me...”

At this point, Qin Yu muttered, “I was forced to resist and it was in self-defense. Sect Master Zhen, don’t blame me.”

Zhen Yue couldn’t help but swallow hard.

Wang Xiong... was sent flying by Qin Yu?!

After all, Wang Xiong was a half-step Martial Marquis!

“Sir, I don’t care who you are. We are here to protect this lake on the orders of the Saint Confucian Sect. I hope you mind your own business,” the person beside Wang Xiong said coldly.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and sneered. “So you guys are from the Saint Confucian Sect... it seems that the Saint Confucian Sect has also set their eyes on this place. This really gives me a headache...”

“Since you know about the Saint Confucian Sect, please leave quickly. The Saint Confucian Sect will definitely owe you a favor!” The person continued.

When Qin Yu heard this, he couldn’t help but sneer. “If you didn’t tell me the name of the Saint Confucian Sect, I might have spared you. But now... What a pity.”

Before Qin Yu finished his words, Qin Yu suddenly disappeared!

In the next second, Qin Yu slapped him!

With just one slap, that Inner Strength Grandmaster’s head exploded!

His corpse fell heavily to the ground. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Before the crowd could react, Qin Yu attacked again.

In the blink of an eye, those Inner Strength Grandmasters all turned into ice-cold corpses!

Everyone was stunned.

Killing an Inner Strength Grandmaster with one slap? What kind of strength was that?!

“It’s your turn.” Qin Yu looked at Wang Xiong.

Wang Xiong’s expression was extremely ugly as he shouted, “Brat, who are you?!”

“Qin Yu.” Qin Yu spat out two words coldly.

“Qin... Qin Yu?! Why is there another Qin Yu?!” Wang Xiong was exasperated.

Zhen Yue seemed to have come to her senses. She rushed forward and said anxiously, “Mr. Qin, I was blind just now. Mr. Qin, please help me drive him away!”

Qin Yu glanced at Zhen Yue and said, “You have nothing to do with me killing him. It’s because I once said that I won’t let anyone from the Saint Confucian Sect go.”

Wang Xiong was a little scared, but he was a half-step Martial Marquis after all. He wouldn’t just sit around and wait for his death.

Wang Xiong’s energy surged, and his body actually began to expand.

His muscles instantly expanded several times, and in the blink of an eye, his clothes burst!

“Qin Yu, you’re going too far. Do you think I, Wang Xiong, am easy to bully?!” Wang Xiong roared angrily and immediately rushed toward Qin Yu!

His fist was almost the same size as Qin Yu’s head, and the terrifying wind even brought up waves behind him!

“Go to h*ll!” Wang Xiong roared angrily!

Qin Yu snorted, raised his palm, and confronted him.

“Snap.”

Wang Xiong’s huge fist was actually held in Qin Yu’s hand!

What was even more terrifying was Wang Xiong struggled with all his might, but he couldn’t break free at all!

“I really didn’t expect that the Saint Confucian Sect would actually target this place.” Qin Yu’s cold voice sounded in Wang Xiong’s ear.

Wang Xiong swallowed hard. At this moment, he realized how big the gap between him and Qin Yu was!

“Don’t... Don’t kill me...” Wang Xiong said in a trembling voice.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I’m sorry, I’m a man of my word.”

Before he finished his words, Qin Yu’s palm suddenly exerted force and crushed Wang Xiong’s fist!

In the next second, Qin Yu’s fist flashed with a golden light and suddenly smashed toward Wang Xiong!

This punch penetrated Wang Xiong’s body!

Wang Xiong lowered his head and looked at his chest. His eyes were filled with fear.

“Half-step Martial Marquis, right? You’re a great tonic. I can’t waste it.” Qin Yu raised his hand and activated the Heaven Swallowing Technique.

In a moment, the extremely strong Wang Xiong turned into a dried corpse.

Their surroundings were silent.

Zhen Yue, her face full of shock, covered her mouth.

“Thank... Thank you, Mr. Qin!” Zhen Yue reacted and said hurriedly.

“Thank you, Mr. Qin!” The others also shouted.

Qin Yu glanced at her and said, “I told you, it’s none of your business that I killed him. Why are you thanking me?”

Zhen Yue said in a low voice, “No matter what, you still protected Beaufort Tower. I will definitely remember this favor.”

“Whatever.” Qin Yu waved his hand.

“Mr. Qin, please... come in!” Zhen Yue cupped her hands and said.

He followed Zhen Yue to the guest room.

“You guys can go out first.” Zhen Yue waved her hand and sent everyone out.

After everyone went out, Zhen Yue locked the door.

Then, she looked at Qin Yu and said in a low voice, “Mr. Qin, I promised that as long as someone helps me solve this problem, I... I will spend a night with that person...”

As she spoke, Zhen Yue had already taken off her black short skirt.
