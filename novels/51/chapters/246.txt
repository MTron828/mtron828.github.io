Chapter 247: One Punch! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s shocking words stunned everyone.

Kill everyone? How was this possible?

After all, there were ten Inner Strength Grandmasters present! There were countless Inner Strength Past Masters!

An Inner Strength Master Hands actually dared to say such arrogant words?

“Qin Yu, I think you’re too big for your britches.” Zhang Hua sneered.

“He’s consoling himself.”

“Maybe it’s because I’m confident.”

Han Yilong’s lips curled into an imperceptible smile.

He cracked a smile and said, “If I kill you, Han Wei might reward me... Qin Yu, you’ve really brought me a surprise.”

“I’m just afraid that you won’t have the chance.” Qin Yu’s lips curled into a sneer.

Han Yilong didn’t waste any more time. He took a step back and said coldly, “Everyone, kill Qin Yu for me!”

As soon as he finished speaking, waves of surging killing intent ignited from everyone’s bodies.

Internal qi burst out one after another. The internal qi of more than ten Inner Strength Grandmasters instantly caused sand and rocks to fly and trees to be uprooted!

Under this pressure, countless wild beasts were shaken into a bloody mist!

Updates by

Some of the weaker ones even vomited blood non-stop!

Even Jing Lu, Jiang Gu, and the others felt waves of intense pressure.

“Qin Yu is in trouble. What a pity.” Fang Yue shook her head slightly while feeling sorry for Qin Yu.

Jiang Gu’s expression was extremely ugly.

He originally wanted to rely on Qin Yu to lead the Jiang family to soar to the top, but he didn’t expect to encounter this situation!

“Mr. Qin, I’m willing to accompany you!” After thinking it over and over again, Jiang Gu finally stood up!

His Inner Strength Grandmaster’s internal qi instantly erupted and he resisted the pressure from the outside world!

“Jiang Gu, you really don’t know your place.” Zhang Hua said coldly.

“Hehe, then we’ll kill you first.” Chen Meng’s body flickered with light, as if he was going to attack at any moment.

“Chen Meng, you ungrateful wretch, don’t think that I’m afraid of you!” Jiang Gu roared and strode forward!

As the former top dog in Chuzhou, his strength naturally couldn’t be underestimated!

After sensing Jiang Gu’s internal qi, Chen Meng’s expression changed slightly.

“Jiang Gu’s strength seems to have improved quite a bit.” Chen Meng’s expression was somewhat solemn.

Zhang Hua also narrowed his eyes.

They seemed to have underestimated Jiang Gu’s strength.

“Let’s attack together and kill him!” Zhang Hua said coldly.

Chen Meng nodded, and the two of them immediately stepped forward!

“Bring it on. What’s there for me, Jiang Gu, to be afraid of?!” Jiang Gu shouted angrily, and in an instant, his internal qi surged!

The top dog in Chuzhou lived up to his reputation!

However, just as he was about to make a move, Qin Yu stretched out his hand to stop Jiang Gu.

“You can leave,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

Jiang Gu was stunned. He hurriedly said, “Mr. Qin, you...”

“I will kill them like slaughtering chickens and dogs!” Qin Yu said coldly.

How arrogant!

This was what everyone thought inside!

Qin Yu’s arrogance had clearly exceeded their imagination!

“Mr. Qin...”

“No need to say more.” Jiang Gu wanted to say something, but was interrupted by Qin Yu.

“Since you want to die, then don’t blame us for being merciless!” Zhang Hua said coldly.

“I also want to see what’s so special about you!” Chen Meng said sinisterly.

As soon as he finished speaking, Zhang Hua took the initiative to attack!

His feet shook, and his body instantly flew up into the air!

In the next second, Zhang Hua jumped down from the air and toward Qin Yu!

Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry. He just raised his head and looked at Zhang Hua coldly!

“Trash, go to h*ll!” Zhang Hua roared angrily. The terrifying gust of wind from his fist caused the ground under Qin Yu’s feet to sink several degrees! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“What terrifying strength!”

“Is this the strength of an Inner Strength Grandmaster...”

“As expected, it’s not something that Inner Strength Master Hands can compare to.”

Everyone was shocked!

Just an ordinary punch was already so powerful! How terrifying were Inner Strength Grandmasters?!

“Boom!”

Very quickly, Zhang Hua’s powerful fist arrived in front of Qin Yu!

“Come, let me see just how powerful a second level Inner Strength Grandmaster is!” Qin Yu’s internal qi didn’t fluctuate. He raised his fist into the air and met it head-on.

“Clang!”

The loud sound was so loud that it almost ruptured one’s eardrums!

The ground beneath Qin Yu’s feet sank a little under this huge force!

One was up in the air while one was sunken in the ground.

The crowd was frozen in place!

The scene where Qin Yu’s body was smashed into pieces didn’t appear! It was just a stalemate in mid-air!

“How... how is this possible?!” Zhang Hua’s expression changed drastically, and he felt a wave of terror inside!

He only felt that Qin Yu’s fists seemed to be made of steel and they were extremely hard!

“How can his body be so hard?!” Zhang Hua thought to himself that something was wrong. He turned his head and tried to pull away!

But Qin Yu didn’t give him a chance at all!

“Taking the initiative to approach me is the biggest mistake of your life.” The corners of Qin Yu’s mouth curled up to reveal a terrifying smile!

Zhang Hua’s expression changed drastically, and his heart was filled with extreme fear!

Just as he was about to leave, Qin Yu approached him and reached out to grab Zhang Hua’s arm!

Following that, Qin Yu suddenly exerted force with his palm and crushed Zhang Hua’s bones!

“Ah!!!”

Zhang Hua was in excruciating pain as he roared out in pain!

“Clang!”

Qin Yu didn’t give up just like that. He waved his large hand and slapped Zhang Hua!

Zhang Hua didn’t have time to dodge. He could only brace himself and raise his hand to meet Qin Yu!

However, Qin Yu’s body had been tempered more than 500 times. How could Zhang Hua be a match against him?

The moment Zhang Hua’s palm touched Qin Yu, his bones were shattered into powder!

Without the support of his bones, Zhang Hua’s two arms were like a pile of meat. They hung in front of his chest and were unable to move!

The crowd was deathly silent.

Only the occasional sound of swallowing could be heard.

No one would have thought that Qin Yu’s physical body would actually be so strong to such an extent!

The body of an Inner Strength Grandmaster in front of him was like an egg hitting a stone!

“How... how is this possible...” someone muttered softly.

“Qin Yu... actually broke Zhang Hua’s arm?”

Duan Shi’s expression was also extremely ugly!

“This kid definitely hid his strength just now!” Duan Shi felt some lingering fear inside!

However, Jing Lu shook his head.

He said indifferently, “Qin Yu doesn’t have any internal qi fluctuations on his body. He is just an Inner Strength Master Hands.”

“What do you mean?” Zhang Hua frowned and asked.

Jing Lu sneered and said, “Qin Yu only has a strong physical body. Other than that, he is useless.”

Duan Shi hurriedly looked at Qin Yu.

As expected, Qin Yu was only an Inner Strength Master Hands!

The reason why he was able to hit Zhang Hua’s arm was purely because he had an extremely hard physical body!

Zhang Hua’s expression was extremely ugly! He was traumatized!

Because Qin Yu’s physical body was too hard!

“Don’t let him get close to you. Other than his physical body, he has no other outstanding strengths.” At this time, the underling beside Han Wei said indifferently.
