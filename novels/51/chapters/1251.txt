Chapter 1252: Chapter 1,252. Try again if you don’t like it! 

That Sharp Fist was grabbed by Qin Yu.

The vast divine power enveloped zi he almost instantly!

Zi He’s expression changed drastically! He wanted to pull out his fist, but he found that he couldn’t move at all!

“How... how is this possible!”Zi He couldn’t help but turn pale with fright!

Qin Yu looked coldly at the panicking zi he in front of him and suddenly exerted force with his palm.

A crisp cracking sound could be heard.

Zi He’s fist was instantly crushed!

This scene made everyone suck in a cold breath!

One had to know that Zi he was in the mighty realm!

The body of a mighty figure was indestructible. Any bone could be treated as a precious treasure!

But now, Zi He’s fist was easily crushed by Qin Yu!

Fresh blood flowed down his wrist. Before zi he could react, Qin Yu had already stretched out his hand and grabbed zi he’s neck!

Zi he inwardly exclaimed that things weren’t looking good!

Clearly, Qin Yu was afraid that Zi he would pull away from him!

“You’re courting death!”Zi he flew into a rage. As a mighty realm expert, he naturally had countless spells under his control.

His mouth opened slightly, and a beam of treasure light shot out, heading straight for Qin Yu’s face!

Qin Yu’s face was expressionless. With a wave of his left hand, this beam of treasure light was directly erased!

“How... How is this possible! ?”

At this moment, Zi he was completely flustered!

Although the spell just now wasn’t considered high-tier, it could still injure his body even when dealing with people of the same realm!

But in front of Qin Yu, it was shattered!

“Not good!”Zi he roared in his heart. He wanted to escape, but it was too late.

Qin Yu’s palm was so powerful that he could not move at all!

This was his neck, he had no way to escape!

Qin Yu grabbed zi he’s neck with one hand, and then he drew the bow from left and right. His huge palm kept hitting zi he’s face.

For a moment, the sounds of slapping could be heard. Soon, Zi He’s face began to swell up.

“If I’m trash, then what are you?”Qin Yu asked coldly as he slapped zi he’s disgusting face.

“Do you really think that you can be so arrogant just because you’re from the Holy Region?”

Dozens of slaps made zi he see stars.

The youths not far away couldn’t help but gulp, and even elder Bai had a shocked expression on his face.

What kind of body was this? To be able to easily subdue a mighty realm expert without relying on spiritual energy was simply unheard of!

Earth, this ancient planet, indeed had endless possibilities!

“Do you admit defeat?”Qin Yu grabbed zi he’s neck and asked coldly.

“F * ck you!”Zi he cursed.

Hearing this, Qin Yu raised his hand again.

“Do you admit defeat?”

“I don’t.”

“Clap Clap Clap!”

“Do you admit defeat?”

“I. . .” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

...

The scene was silent.

No one had expected that a big shot from the holy region would be grabbed by Qin Yu like a chick and slapped.

“Enough!”

At this moment, elder Bai couldn’t stand it anymore.

He walked forward and said coldly, “Let him go.”

Qin Yu glanced at elder Bai and said, “He hasn’t admitted defeat yet. How can I let him go?”

Elder bai frowned and said, “He has already lost. There’s nothing to say.”

Qin Yu snorted and threw zi he out.

At this time, half of Zi He’s face had been shattered, and blood kept flowing down from the corner of his mouth. He looked terrible.

He got up from the ground and glared at Qin Yu. He gnashed his teeth and said, “Kid, you’re Courting Death!”

Qin Yu glanced at Zi he and said coldly, “Do you still remember what I said just now? If you lose, we’ll all step into the Holy Region.”

Zi he gritted his teeth and said, “When did I admit defeat? You want to go to the Holy Region? Dream On!”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and sneered, “What? Are you going to go back on your word?”

Zi he said angrily, “So what if I go back on my word? Let me tell you, it’s up to me whether you go to the holy region or Not!”

Qin Yu’s face gradually turned cold. He looked at elder Bai as if he was waiting for elder Bai to say something fair.

Elder Bai coughed and said indifferently, “Your name is Qin Yu, right?”

“That’s right.”Qin Yu nodded.

Elder bai continued, “Your physical body is indeed beyond imagination, but there are also people who are similar to you in the Holy Region. Their physical bodies are comparable to prehistoric beasts and are indestructible.”

Qin Yu remained silent and waited for his follow-up.

At this moment, elder Bai changed the topic, he sighed and said, “But... although the body is strong, it can’t use spiritual power. What’s the difference between this and an uncivilized beast? No matter how strong the body is, there is a limit. It Won’t be of much use.”

Qin Yu’s expression turned slightly cold, and he said coldly, “Then what does elder Bai Mean?”

Elder Bai said indifferently, “We came here this time to look for talent, so... Let’s forget it.”

“So, you’re planning to go back on your word?”Qin Yu questioned coldly.

“Kid, isn’t elder Bai’s words clear enough? !”Zi he shouted.

He stepped forward and sneered, “I just made a mistake just now. There are many ways to kill you. Try again if you’re not satisfied!”

The anger in Qin Yu’s heart had become more and more vigorous, almost reaching the edge of tolerance.

He took a deep breath, and a smile couldn’t help but appear on his face.

“Okay, I’ll listen to you,”Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

Zi he snorted lightly, “That’s more like it. You have to recognize the gap.”

With that, he walked to the test god stone and said coldly, “Well, get lost quickly. Don’t delay our test.”

But at this moment, a cold light flashed in Qin Yu’s eyes.

He suddenly stretched out his hand and grabbed Zihe’s neck, grabbing him again.

“F * ck, you didn’t keep your word. Why do you still want to open your mouth? Why don’t I tear it for you!”Qin Yu said coldly.
