Chapter 792: Activate the Power of a Martial Saint! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Internal qi was spreading rapidly and in the blink of an eye, it had disappeared without a trace.

Qin Yu looked at the old man in front of him and said coldly, “If you still don’t show your trump card, I’m afraid you won’t have a chance.”

The old man’s expression instantly became solemn.

He didn’t expect this young man in front of him to be so powerful.

The old man took two steps back and a bracelet suddenly lit up in his hand.

This bracelet emitted a strong and simple internal qi. The moment it was taken out, a sense of pressure spread out.

“Martial Saint Weapon?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows as if he had recognized this item.

The old man sneered. “You know quite a lot! That’s right, the weapon in my hand is a Martial Saint Weapon! If you know what’s good for you, kneel down and beg for mercy immediately. I’ll give you a quick death!”

“So you’re relying on this Martial Saint Weapon.” Qin Yu said coldly.

The old man said with some displeasure, “Kid, you seem to look down on this Martial Saint Weapon? Do you know that this Martial Saint Weapon can erupt with the power of a true Martial Saint?!”

“So what?” Qin Yu sneered again and again.

Normally, the power emitted by the Martial Saint Weapon was indeed above the power of a Martial Saint.

After all, that was the purest form of the Martial Saint’s internal qi, and it wasn’t transferred to someone else’s body.

However, Qin Yu wasn’t an ordinary person.

How could an ordinary person compare to the power that he had unleashed after possessing the power of a Martial Saint?

“Little b*stard, you really don’t know what’s good for you!” The old man seemed to be a little angry.

“Alright, if that’s the case, then I’ll send you to hell!”

Following the old man’s angry roar, the bracelet in his hand immediately began to emit an internal qi!

An internal qi that originated from a Martial Saint quickly gathered on the bracelet. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Buzz!”

A faint light emitted from the bracelet. Following that, an extremely powerful internal qi headed straight for Qin Yu!

Qin Yu hurriedly crossed his arms in front of him to protect his face!

“Boom!”

That internal qi smashed onto Qin Yu’s arm!

Qin Yu’s entire body was instantly sent flying!

His arm was also shattered, revealing his sparkling white bones!

Not only that, but that terrifying internal qi also caused Qin Yu’s internal organs to tremble. He couldn’t help but spit out a mouthful of blood.

“As expected of a Martial Saint Weapon.” Qin Yu looked at his own arm and couldn’t help but mutter in a low voice.

It was still impossible for him to use his own abilities to fight against a Martial Saint Weapon.

“You’re not dead.” That old man narrowed his eyes slightly and couldn’t help but snort coldly. “Little b*stard, you’re really shocking.”

“But can you withstand it the next time? Can you withstand it the second time?!”

As the old man roared angrily, the bracelet emitted light once again!

Qin Yu no longer held back his strength. He took a deep breath and immediately activated the Martial Saint’s power!

The moment the Martial Saint’s power was activated, a warm current immediately spread throughout his body!

His dantian was like the sea, and countless streams flowed throughout his entire body!

In an instant, the internal qi on Qin Yu’s body suddenly rose!

That incomparably powerful and terrifying power swept through the entire Purple Flame Sect!

At this moment, Qin Yu seemed to have changed into a completely different person.

Under the blessing of the Martial Saint’s power, Qin Yu had a strange feeling.

It was as if... everything in front of him was worthless.

That Martial Saint Weapon was more like a toy!

When they felt the pressure from Qin Yu’s body, everyone’s expression couldn’t help but change drastically!

“It’s the Martial Saint’s power! The Xue family gave the Martial Saint’s power to this kid!” Bai Sha roared!

The old man shouted angrily, “So what if it’s the Martial Saint’s power?! It’s not worth mentioning in front of my Martial Saint Weapon!”

He roared continuously and activated this Martial Saint Weapon with all his might!

A terrifying ray of light closed in on Qin Yu!

Qin Yu looked at this approaching ray of light coldly and the corners of his mouth curled into a sneer.

Just when the ray of light was about to land on Qin Yu’s body, Qin Yu clenched his fist and suddenly went up to meet it!

“Boom!”

The golden light exploded with a dazzling radiance! At the instant of the collision, the internal qi emitted by the Martial Saint Weapon immediately dispersed!

Not only that, but the remaining power of the fist was also approaching the old man!

The old man’s expression changed drastically as he hurriedly activated the Martial Saint Weapon to counter the attack!

However, the power of this punch was too great! Even with the support of the Martial Saint Weapon, the old man’s body was trembling like a sieve!

“Crack!”

At this moment, a crisp sound entered everyone’s ears.

At a glance, the Martial Saint Weapon had shattered!

With just one punch, he had shattered the Martial Saint Weapon!

This strength made everyone’s faces turn ashen!

It was almost unheard of for a Martial Saint Weapon to be shattered!

“Boom!”

Without the Martial Saint Weapon, the old man’s body was sent flying!

His skinny body was instantly shattered!

Qin Yu looked at him coldly with indifference in his eyes.

“So this is the power of a Martial Saint.” Qin Yu lowered his head and looked at his own fist.

Even Qin Yu himself was a little shocked.

This was only the power of a Martial Saint, yet it had such a terrifying power.

If he had become a Martial Saint, what kind of power would he possess?

Most likely, one punch would possess the power of a nuclear bomb.

It was unimaginable!

The old man struggled to get up, but his body had already shattered and he couldn’t stand up.

The intense pain all over his body caused him to wail incessantly.

Fear made him tremble like a sieve.

Qin Yu took a step forward and instantly arrived before the old man.

He looked down at the old man from above. The coldness in his eyes made the old man even more afraid.

“Don’t... Don’t kill me. I’m willing to give the Purple Flame Sect to you...” the old man begged bitterly.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Do you know what beating the dog before the lion is?”

The old man was stunned. An ominous premonition immediately flashed through his heart.

“Only by destroying the Purple Flame Sect can we intimidate the other sects. So... you have to die. Everyone in the Purple Flame Sect has to die,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Without waiting for the old man to speak, Qin Yu stomped down.

“Crack!”

This stomp sent the old man to his death.

Qin Yu bent down and took out his Golden Core.

After wiping off the blood on the Golden Core, Qin Yu kept it in his bag.

“Don’t... Don’t kill us!” The remaining Martial Marquises of the Purple Flame Sect were so scared that they quickly knelt on the ground.

However, Qin Yu didn’t stop. He raised his hand and lightly slapped forward.

These ten plus Martial Marquises were instantly smashed into meat paste.

“The power of a Martial Saint... is truly terrifying.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

The power unleashed by the power of a Martial Saint was far inferior to that of a true Martial Saint.

Even so, it still possessed such terrifying power.

This couldn’t help but cause Qin Yu to feel some anticipation.

He longed for the strength after stepping into the Martial Saint realm.

After that, Qin Yu took out their Golden Cores, turned around, and walked out of the Purple Flame Sect.

Standing at the entrance of the Purple Flame Sect, Qin Yu casually waved his palm.

In an instant, the sky and earth shook, and the entire Purple Flame Sect turned into ruins in an instant.
