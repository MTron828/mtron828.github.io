1761 Xiao Sheng Exits Seclusion

At a glance, a huge black hole could be seen not far away, absorbing this power!

“It’s Rashomon!”

Wen Wanchong was the first to shout!

Indeed, it was Xiao Sheng’s Rashomon!

“Rashomon... Has Xiao Sheng come out of seclusion?” Yuan Xiu’s expression changed drastically!

Wasn’t his speed a little too fast?

If Xiao Sheng came out of seclusion, there would be no suspense in this battle!

If Xiao Hai, who was only a half-step Reversion Void Stage, was able to force Yuan Xiu to use his trump card, then Xiao Sheng at the Reversion Void Stage... It was unimaginable!

Before Yuan Xiu could panic, a terrifying force had already swept over him!

A powerful sense of oppression filled the entire city, and everyone was shocked!

The sky had already brightened up, and the ray of sunlight pierced through the horizon.

Then, a figure walked out of the darkness.

This person was none other than Xiao Sheng!

Xiao Sheng’s face was cold.

Even though he looked exactly the same as Xiao Hai, one could still tell the difference at a glance.

Xiao Hai was a warm person who could save the world, while Xiao Sheng was a cold person who could ignore everything.

He walked towards Yuan Xiu, step by step. With every step he took, the terrifying pressure grew stronger.

“Xiao Sheng... In the end, you still managed to reach the Reversion Void Stage.” Yuan Xiu took a deep breath.

Xiao Sheng glared at Yuan Xiu coldly before shifting his gaze to Xiao Hai.

As their eyes met, Xiao Sheng’s expression turned even colder.

He looked in the direction of Yuan Xiu and said, word for word, “This is the second time you’ve injured him so badly.”

Yuan Xiu’s body tensed up and he immediately sneered.”So what if you’ve reached the Reversion Void Stage? Do you think I’ll be afraid of you?”

“What do you think?” Xiao Sheng’s eyes narrowed slightly as he sent a palm strike towards Yuan Xiu!

Yuan Xiu didn’t dare to delay and hurriedly raised his hand to meet the attack.

However, the moment they touched, Yuan Xiu was immediately sent flying!

He only felt pain in his wrist, and it was extremely uncomfortable!

As expected, the Reversion Void Stage Xiao Sheng was even more terrifying than he had imagined!

“Xiao Sheng, if you really have the guts, come to the North Plain and find me. I will wait for you there!” Yuan Xiu saw that the situation was not good and made a prompt decision. He planned to escape after saying that.

He hurriedly activated a spatial formation in an attempt to escape.

However, the moment the spatial formation appeared, Xiao Sheng sent a palm strike over, shattering the entrance into pieces!

The entrance that had appeared for less than half a second disappeared without a trace.

Yuan Xiu’s pupils immediately shrank! He glared at Xiao Sheng and gritted his teeth, “You... You actually broke the entrance?”

“Do you think I’ll let you escape back to the North Plain?” Xiao Sheng said coldly.

“Even if you destroy the entrance, I can still escape!” Yuan Xiu gritted his teeth and said.

“Is that so?” Xiao Sheng sneered. Every time he took a step forward, Yuan Xiu would feel terrifying pressure!

His entire body was trembling in extreme pain!

“Xiao Sheng, don’t go too far! So what if you’ve reached the Reversion Void Stage? I’m not afraid of you!” Yuan Xiu shouted.

With that, his aura burst out again and he activated the scene with all his might.

That terrifying aura appeared again, and thousands of killing intent surged out from it!

“Go to hell!”

Yuan Xiu let out a furious roar as he directed his killing intent towards Xiao Sheng!

A hint of killing intent flashed across Xiao Sheng’s face as he raised his jade-like palm.

In an instant, a surge of power burst forth from his palm. This power was extremely pure, and there was no technique involved. It was just pure power!

“Boom!”

Under this palm, even the terrifying image behind Yuan Xiu began to tremble, let alone the thousands of killing intent!

“Thump, thump, thump!”

Yuan Xiu was instantly forced back a few steps. The backlash from the force caused him to spit out a mouthful of blood! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Everyone sucked in a cold breath!

The previously powerful Yuan Xiu was now extremely weak!

In front of Xiao Sheng, he seemed to have no ability to resist at all!

“Yuan Xiu, you’re really a piece of trash. It’s such a waste for the Immortal Slaying Sect’s inheritance to be in your hands.” Xiao Sheng shook his head slightly.

Yuan Xiu opened his mouth. Although he was extremely unhappy, this was a fact.

He had comprehended the Immortal Slaying Sect’s inheritance for many years, but his comprehension had only scratched the surface.

Even the scene hanging above his head was just a drawing of a tiger that resembled a cat. He was far from being able to comprehend its essence!

“If you really have thoroughly comprehended the Immortal Slaying Sect’s inheritance, I’m afraid it’s hard to say who will win and who will lose today. However, your brain doesn’t seem to be open. After spending so many years, is this all you’ve comprehended?” Xiao Sheng coldly mocked.

Yuan Xiu gritted his teeth and glared at Xiao Sheng. “Stop looking down on me. My strength is not something you can understand!”

“Is that so?” Xiao Sheng’s face turned even colder.

He raised his palm and said indifferently, “Then let me see so for myself. Otherwise, I’m afraid you won’t have the chance.”

“Wait!”

At this moment, Yuan Xiu suddenly shouted.

He took a deep breath and looked at Xiao Hai.

“Xiao Hai, I know you’ve always been kind. can you let me go today? In the future, I’ll definitely repay you a hundred times, a thousand times over!” Yuan Xiu said, suppressing his anger.

Xiao Hai looked at Yuan Xiu in front of him and shook his head. “If a person like you were to live, I’m afraid that more people will die in the future.”

“Furthermore, I can’t decide for Xiao Sheng.”

Yuan Xiu’s expression turned increasingly unsightly.

He did not expect that the Lord of North Plain would end up like this.

Everything had changed too quickly. Yuan Xiu, who had been in control of everything just a moment ago, had fallen into such a state.

The Reversion Void Stage Xiao Sheng was far more terrifying than one could imagine.

“If that’s the case, then don’t blame me.” Yuan Xiu gritted his teeth.

His body was constantly emitting a black aura, which was surging towards the scene. Or rather, the scene was absorbing Yuan Xiu’s aura!

“Hurry up and kill him!” Xiao Hai shouted.

Xiao Sheng wasn’t in the least bit anxious.

How could the conceited Xiao Sheng take the opportunity to attack?

Xiao Sheng stood with his hands behind his back, waiting for Yuan Xiu.

Yuan Xiu’s body trembled. His aura seemed to have been completely absorbed.

“Boom, boom, boom...”

At this moment, the scene actually began to move!

The entire scene was crushing down in Xiao Sheng’s direction!

It was as if the ancient Immortal Slaying Sect had been resurrected, and it was going to suppress Xiao Sheng!

“Xiao Sheng, go to hell!” Yuan Xiu bellowed continuously!

Xiao Sheng raised his palm, and a crystal-clear radiance appeared on it.

He looked at this scene, not a trace of fear on his face.

Very quickly, the ancient Immortal Slaying Sect came crushing down in Xiao Sheng’s direction. A terrifying aura enveloped the earth, shattering everything.
