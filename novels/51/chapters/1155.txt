Chapter 1156: Chapter 1,156, comprehending the DOU character formula 

Yan Yongfu heaved a sigh of relief, while the surrounding higher-ups cursed Yan Yongfu incessantly.

But at this time, Yan Yongfu couldn’t care less.

He turned a deaf ear and pretended not to hear.

Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, two days had passed.

During these two days, Gu Xinghe was busy recruiting troops, so he didn’t come to the first mystical realm.

After two days, Qin Yu was barely able to bear the pain and study the fighting formula.

He did not waste any more time and began to devote himself to the fighting formula.

...

Gu Xinghe, who had received the power of eight high-level officials, could be said to be in high spirits at this moment.

Not only did he recruit a large number of people, but he also gathered all the almighty experts in the world.

At the Martial Arts Association’s discussion hall in Jingdu.

Gu Xinghe sat on the huge chair at the front of the discussion hall and quietly scanned the crowd.

At a glance, there were actually more than ten almighty experts!

These people’s internal Qi was slightly dry, and the strength they could display was about the same as Tian Zong’s.

But even so, they still maintained their proper arrogance. After all, they were already top-notch experts a thousand years ago.

Gu Xinghe swept his gaze across the crowd and calmly said, “The JINGDU martial arts association needs to be rebuilt, and my goal is also very simple. I want the Jingdu martial arts association to be unprecedentedly powerful!”

“All along, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s main forces have been purple robe and black gold cannon. The purple robe from before was only a martial marquis, but today, I want the almighty to become purple robe! That is, everyone present!”

As soon as these words were said, a trace of ridicule flashed across the faces of the many almighty experts below.

“Ignorant child, you don’t know the immensity of Heaven and Earth,”a powerful expert said coldly.

“We have been sealed up for hundreds of years, not to accompany your country. The Jingdu Martial Arts Association in Your Eyes is worthless in my eyes.”

“That’s right. In this birth, we want to step into the holy region, not to work for you.”

Gu Xinghe seemed to have already anticipated their attitude.

He slowly stood up and looked coldly at the many almighty experts in front of him, he said, “In this world, strength is the most important! So what if you’re all in the Almighty Realm? Put away your arrogance and either work for me or Die For me!”

With that, Gu Xinghe suddenly stretched out his palm, and a dazzling light covered a mighty expert!

That mighty figure’s expression changed greatly, and he hurriedly raised his hand to receive it. However, he only had the strength of a half-step mighty figure, so how could he be a match for Gu Xinghe!

The moment they touched, this mighty figure’s body was directly shattered!

Gu Xinghe snorted lightly, and his palm shone again, directly crushing that mighty figure’s primordial spirit with his bare hands!

Seeing this scene, the expressions of many mighty figures were somewhat unsightly.

Gu Xinghe’s actions were so vicious that it made them feel apprehensive.

“Is there anyone else who isn’t convinced?”Gu Xinghe said indifferently with his hands behind his back.

The various almighty experts looked at each other, seemingly unable to make up their minds for a moment.

If they didn’t agree to Gu Xinghe’s words today, they were afraid that they would really die here.

In that case, they would have waited for hundreds of years in vain.

“We can agree to work for you.”Finally, a mighty figure stood out.

He looked at GU xinghe and said, “However, we have a condition. After the opening of the Holy Region, we must regain our freedom. This is our bottom line.”

“You still have a bottom line?”Gu Xinghe raised his brows and could not help but sneer.

That mighty figure snorted coldly and said, “Although your current strength is above us, if we burn our blood essence and recover to the peak, it is hard to say who is stronger.”

Gu xinghe laughed out loud, “Are you guys willing to burn your blood essence? You all know the consequences!”

“That’s right, the price of burning our blood essence is huge. However, we have waited for so many years for the sake of the Holy Region,”the Almighty said coldly.

“If we can’t go to the holy region, we might as well have one last glorious day.”

Hearing this, Gu Xinghe’s brows furrowed.

If so many mighty figures went crazy, it would really be troublesome.

After thinking for a while, Gu Xinghe said in a low voice, “Alright, I’ll agree to your request, but before the Holy Region Opens, you must listen to my orders!”

“Deal,”the many mighty figures below agreed.

A month was enough.

A dozen or so mighty figures were enough to sweep this world.

Furthermore, once the array platforms were destroyed, it would be impossible to go to the holy region.

It was no exaggeration to say that the current Gu Xinghe already had the ability to talk to a country.

Gu Xinghe didn’t waste any time and immediately began his actions.

First, he rebuilt the prestige of the martial arts association in Jingdu and informed the martial arts world of the rebuilding of the martial arts association in Jingdu.

Then, he sent many mighty figures to all over the world to search for the eighteen array platforms! Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Of course, Gu Xinghe did not tell these mighty figures his purpose of searching for the array platforms. Otherwise, these mighty figures would probably go all out against Gu Xinghe.

...

In the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, everyone had thought hard for many days, but they still could not find a perfect method.

Putting aside the fact that Gu Xinghe could not cross over, they did not even know how to enter the first secret realm.

“Damn it, I can’t take it anymore!”

Finally, Chang Mang, who could not see any hope, shattered the bandages on his body.

He stood up and walked toward the door.

“Chang Mang, what are you doing!”The pavilion master asked coldly.

Chang Mang clenched his fist and said coldly, “I, Chang Mang, was born between heaven and earth, not to cower like a sewer rat! As a man, I will not linger on my last breath. At worst, I will die!”

With that, Chang Mang strode out of the door.
