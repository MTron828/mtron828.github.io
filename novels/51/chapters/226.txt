Chapter 227: The Distressed Jiang Gu Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Hui Ming’s face suddenly turned pale! A wave of fear spread from the bottom of his heart!

This person was simply a devil!

His bones, chest, head, and even his lower body had been shattered countless times by Qin Yu!

No one could withstand such pain!

In the blink of an eye, an hour had passed.

Hui Ming’s body had been smashed countless times!

He was on the verge of collapse! He could pass out at any moment!

Qin Yu began to show signs of exhaustion.

The spiritual power in his body was shockingly insufficient, and even his internal qi began to slowly decline!

Before long, Qin Yu’s physical strength would also be exhausted.

“No, I can’t hold on any longer.” Hui Ming’s forehead dripped with sweat.

“Boom!”

Without waiting for him to make a decision, Qin Yu threw another punch, shattering his body once again.

The repeated shattering and reorganization pushed Hui Ming to the brink of collapse!

“Ah!! Shameless brat!” Hui Ming raised his head and roared angrily.

“I won’t let you off the hook!”

“Pa!”

Just as he finished speaking, Qin Yu smashed his face into pieces with a slap!

“Cut the crap, I actually like torturing people quite much,” Qin Yu said while panting slightly.

“People like you should go to the eighteenth level of h*ll!”

“I’ll treat it as letting you experience the torture of h*ll in advance.”

Qin Yu grinned while revealing a mouthful of white teeth.

The cruel smile on his face made Hui Ming, who had wanted to persist, completely break down!

No one could bear the inhuman torture!

“No, I can’t hold on anymore!” Hui Ming’s expression was extremely anguished. He gritted his teeth and felt somewhat annoyed!

No matter how well prepared he was, he had never foreseen this! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Right at this moment, Hui Ming suddenly thought of something!

He turned his head to look at Jiang Gu, who had been watching the battle, and the corners of his mouth curled up into a sneer.

In terms of raw strength, Jiang Gu’s strength was above Hui Ming’s!

And he had been watching the battle all this time, so he was in his peak condition.

Dealing with the current Qin Yu wouldn’t be a problem for him at all!

At the thought of this, Hui Ming couldn’t help but laugh out loud!

He chanted a spell and the scene in front of him began to transform!

Soon, the surroundings returned to the scene during the meal.

Qin Yu glanced around and sneered. “What, you can’t hold on anymore?”

Hui Ming licked his lips and sneered. “You’re right, I can’t hold on anymore.”

“So?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and walked toward Hui Ming step by step.

Hui Ming wasn’t afraid. He gritted his teeth and said, “But unfortunately, you still have to die today!”

“Oh really?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

Hui Ming didn’t say anything. He turned his head to look at Jiang Gu and shouted, “Jiang Gu, your chance is here! Kill Qin Yu immediately!”

When he heard this, Qin Yu and Jiang Gu’s expressions changed at the same time.

Their eyes met. It was as if the two sides had been in a stalemate for countless rounds!

Qin Yu looked at Jiang Gu coldly. Vigilance flashed in his eyes.

Jiang Gu, on the other hand, had a conflicted look on his face. His heart was beating violently!

“Jiang Gu, kill him for me! Now!” Hui Ming couldn’t help but roar angrily when he saw that Jiang Gu didn’t make a move!

Jiang Gu took a deep breath, and his internal qi began to rise rapidly!

The pressure of an Inner Strength Grandmaster burst out again!

After feeling this strong pressure, Hui Ming couldn’t help but laugh out loud!

“An Inner Strength Grandmaster is powerful enough to kill you now!” Hui Ming roared crazily.

Qin Yu ignored Hui Ming.

He looked at Jiang Gu and said coldly, “Why did you betray me?”

Distress flashed across Jiang Gu’s face.

He gritted his teeth and said, “Mr. Qin, Hui Ming kidnapped my son. If... If I don’t comply, my son will die!”

“I’ve already lost Haoran. I can’t lose Jiang Yu...”

As he spoke, Jiang Gu’s face was already covered in tears.

He knelt on the ground with a plop and sobbed.

“Mr. Qin, forgive me. I will definitely avenge you...” Jiang Gu wiped his tears and said indignantly.

Hui Ming, who was at the side, laughed maniacally. “Well done. Stop talking nonsense. As long as you kill Qin Yu, I will return your son to you!”

“At that time, you can still be the King of Chuzhou!”

“The Earth Fiend Valley will also secretly get rid of all your opponents for you!”

“Do it!”

Jiang Gu stood up from the ground.

A strong murderous aura burst out from his body.

As the top dog in Chuzhou, his strength couldn’t be doubted.

A dense aura pressed toward Qin Yu.

Inner strength surged on both of his hands.

A strange light appeared on Jiang Gu’s palms.

“Mr. Qin, I hope you don’t blame me...” Jiang Gu murmured in a low voice.
