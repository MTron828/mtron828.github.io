1847 One-sided Defeat

This long-bearded elder had evolved the Tong family’s holy sword!

“It looks like this person’s status in the Tong family is not low!” someone exclaimed.

If he were an ordinary cultivator of the Tong family, he would certainly not be qualified to cultivate this technique. He would not even be entitled to touch it!

The long-bearded elder raised his hand and cast such a terrifying spell as if he wanted to give Qin Yu a taste of his power!

The long-bearded elder raised his sword with one hand and slashed down. Wisps of extremely holy internal qi filled the air. Everybody could smell a trace of Holy Power from this holy sword for a moment.

However, Qin Yu was unmoved. Looking at the holy sword that had locked onto him, his internal qi exploded to the extreme.

Tens of thousands of wisps of holy internal qi merged into one at this moment and condensed on Qin Yu’s right fist.

Without hesitation, he threw out a punch that was like a flying Divine Dragon. It was as if it had left Qin Yu’s body with a destructive force!

The holy sword’s technique received Qin Yu’s terrifying physical body. The sky and earth instantly cracked at this moment, and everything shattered!

Qin Yu’s terrifying power shocked everyone, and his formidable strength made people prostrate in worship.

The moment the fist struck out, the holy sword began to jitter! Blood also appeared on Qin Yu’s fist.

Qin Yu evolved the dao technique to the extreme and thoroughly integrated it with his body. The next second, Qin Yu roared and took a step forward. Golden Light on his fist suddenly burst out and drowned the holy sword!

“Boom!”

Golden Light swallowed the holy sword, and the light blasted toward the long-bearded elder!

The long-bearded elder’s expression changed drastically. He wanted to escape, but it was too late.

At this moment, Qin Yu used a secret technique of space. Golden Light shattered the void and came for the kill.

The long-bearded elder’s pupils contracted. If this punch hit, no one would survive!

“Boom!”

Under everyone’s shocked gazes, Golden Light landed on the long-bearded elder’s body.

His chest exploded in an instant, and blood splattered everywhere like rain. The enormous bloody hole in his chest was a frightful sight.

The long-bearded elder still thought of escape. However, before he could do anything, his body exploded, and even his corpse was unsighted!

Everyone looked dazed as if they didn’t understand what had happened.

The cultivators of the Tong family were horrified. The long-bearded elder was the most formidable existence among them, but now a punch had killed him. How could they stay calm?

“A Reversion Void Stage cultivator is gone just like this.” Someone couldn’t help but sigh.

“A Reversion Void Stage cultivator was killed in just a few minutes. I’m afraid it is going to be an era where Reversion Void Stage cultivators are no better than animals.”

The crowd of onlookers sighed with emotion as if they had already foreseen the future.

“If you don’t have a Saint Weapon, I’m afraid none of you can escape,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Li Yingying’s face turned ashen. She had never expected this to be a one-sided crushing!

She gritted her teeth and turned around to escape.

However, just as she turned around, the space froze!

Her body seemed frozen like ice, unable to move at all!

At a glance, they saw Qin Yu raise one hand and then seal the space. As the sealed area was tremendously small, there was no way to escape, let alone to move.

“If you have a Saint Weapon, perhaps you can still fight,” Qin Yu said coldly.

They were shocked. They didn’t have any Saint Weapons. Without a doubt, they didn’t take Qin Yu seriously at all!

It wasn’t just the thought of the few of them but the judgment of the Tong family.

To deal with Xiao Sheng, they had come with a Saint Weapon. To deal with Qin Yu, these few Reversion Void Stage cultivators were more than enough!

“Retreat!”

Someone whispered a signal to retreat.

The few of them looked at each other and turned to leave.

However, when they turned around, Qin Yu was already in front of them, blocking their way.

They didn’t even have time to react with such speed!

“You won’t be able to leave today,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Qin Yu, don’t over-bully,” one of them said.

“Don’t tell me you want to kill us all? If we fight with all our might, you might not be our match,” another person spoke.

Qin Yu squinted his eyes, sneered, and said, “You’ve thought too highly of yourself. In my eyes, you’re like grass.”

“What a big talk!” One of them was instantly enraged. After a loud shout, he held the vast qi in his hand and ruthlessly attacked Qin Yu!

This time, Qin Yu did not move at all. However, at the moment of contact, he was wrapped in a layer of golden radiance!

Saintly Body Technique! It was the Saintly Body Technique that Qin Yu did not use for a long time!

Wrapped by the Saintly Body Technique, Qin Yu did not move at all. Instead, the vibration had caused his arm to be in pain and directly shatter all the internal qi!

“Hmm?” The attacker’s face instantly filled with shock. He knew clearly what this punch of his meant!

Qin Yu’s face was full of mockery. The corners of his lips that curled up slightly were full of contempt for these people.

“You…”

Before he could speak, Qin Yu suddenly slapped him!

It was a slap full of strength and directly smashed his head. Even his primordial spirit couldn’t fly out in time!

Everyone was tremendously shocked by the scene!

They suddenly realized that Qin Yu was not serious at all just now! It seemed that he only showed his true strength now!

They were both at the Reversion Void stage, but he had indeed defeated them all!

“You…” The cultivators of the Tong family were terrified and full of despair!

It turned out that Qin Yu’s strength was far above theirs!

There was no need to fight at all! To Qin Yu, he seemed to be toying with them!

“Run!”

One of them came back to his senses and turned around to escape.

However, they were too slow, or Qin Yu was rather too fast. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Qin Yu, who had the line word formula, was not someone they could compare.

The few of them who were scared out of their wits didn’t even have the strength to fight back.

Qin Yu smacked them like watermelons, one after another. Their heads cracked, and the cracking sound was endless.

In less than ten minutes, it left with only one Reversion Void Stage cultivator from the Tong family!

This person was seriously injured and fell to the ground, panting.

His eyes filled with fear. It was not sure if it was from the despair he felt from Qin Yu’s terrifying strength or the impending death.

Qin Yu looked at him coldly. He bent down and said, “Now, we can talk about the strength of the Tong family.”

“I…”

“You don’t have any other choice. Even if you don’t tell me, I will still search your divine sense by force,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The cultivator knew that there was no way he could escape. He gritted his teeth and forced back his internal qi. he chose to self-destruct at the last moment.
