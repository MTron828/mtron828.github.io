Chapter 1116: Chapter 1,116: pill refinement and seclusion 

At the critical moment of the opening of the holy region, Yan Jinyao’s cultivation had been crippled. There was nothing more painful than this.

Other than Yan Jinyao, he teng was also cultivating at the moment.

However, his cultivation seemed to have reached a bottleneck as well. After several days of seclusion, he showed no signs of breaking through.

“Before the holy region opens, I must kill him!”A drop of cold sweat dripped down he Teng’s forehead.

“Leave it to me... leave the body to me, I can get rid of him at any time...”the hoarse voice sounded again.

He teng coldly said, “Don’t think about it. If I leave the body to you, then what’s the meaning of my existence?”

“Hehe... Your body will be mine sooner or later...”the hoarse voice said sinisterly.

He Teng remained silent.

Although he coexisted with this divine sense, he had always been on guard against it, and he was constantly snatching the initiative of his body.

Therefore, he teng wanted to raise his cultivation as soon as possible until he did not need the help of this divine sense.

...

Time flew by.

In the blink of an eye, five days had passed.

In these five days, Qin Yu and the others had refined dozens of heavenly essence pills.

“According to this progress, in another five days, I will have close to a hundred sky origin pills,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

A Hundred Sky origin pills was enough to support him to enter the middle stage of the Martial Saint Realm.

Ever since the news of the Holy Region spread, the world seemed to have become much calmer.

The Martial World had fallen into silence, and there were fewer disputes.

However, everyone knew clearly in their hearts that this was the final calm before the storm.

Soon, a week passed.

Xiang Danqing was the first to collapse. He opened his eyes tiredly and said weakly, “I can’t do it anymore. With my current condition, I can’t refine the Heavenly Yuan pill anymore.”

The pavilion master at the side glanced at Xiang Danqing leisurely and said, “After so many years, you still haven’t made any progress.”

Xiang Danqing gritted his teeth. Although he was unwilling, his body had already reached its limit.

“Hmph, I want to see how many more days you can hold on.”Xiang Danqing stood up, turned around and walked out.

Pavilion master closed her eyes slightly. In reality, she was also about to reach her limit, and so was Qin Yu. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The two of them were bitterly holding on.

On the ninth day, Qin Yu and Pavilion Master couldn’t hold on any longer.

The strange flower in the two cauldrons directly turned into a pile of mud.

They actually failed to refine the pills this time.

“It seems that we have reached our limit.”Qin Yu and pavilion master looked at each other.

Pavilion master stood up and said slowly, “A whole nine days has already exceeded our imagination.”

“Yes.”Qin Yu sighed.

He looked at the Heavenly Yuan pills in front of him. At this moment, they already had seventy-eight heavenly yuan pills in their hands.

“These are enough.”Qin Yu’s large hand glowed as he put away the sky origin pills.

Pavilion master nodded slightly and said, “The sky origin pills have a great increase in cultivation. Even if your physique is special, seventy-eight pills are enough to step into the intermediate stage of the Martial Saint Stage.”

Qin Yu acknowledged and then cupped his hands together and said, “Thank you, pavilion master. I won’t bother you any longer. I’ll go find a place to enter closed-door cultivation now.”

“Do you think you can still enter closed-door cultivation in your current state?”Pavilion master shook his head.

Qin Yu stood up. His vision was dizzy and he almost fell down.

Pavilion master was right. With Qin Yu’s current state, he indeed couldn’t enter closed-door cultivation.

“Let’s Rest for a day first,”pavilion master said.

“A day’s time is nothing.”

Although Qin Yu was a little anxious, he really had no other way at the moment. He could only nod and say, “That’s good too. I haven’t returned to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion for a long time.”

With that, Qin Yu jumped down from the pavilion master’s building.

He was the first to arrive at Taozi’s mansion.

Taozi, Zhang Yijiu, and Xiao Qing lived in the same mansion.

Qin Yu pushed open the door and entered. The moment he entered, he saw Taozi studying a pill book.

“Qin Yu!”The moment she saw Qin Yu, Taozi ran over with a face full of surprise and joy.

Qin Yu smiled and sat down. He said, “Taozi, have you made any progress in your pill skills recently?”

Taozi said proudly, “Of course, I’ll show you!”

Taozi flipped her palm and a ball of green spiritual fire fell into her palm.

“Your spiritual fire... actually advanced? How did you do that?”Qin Yu was shocked.

Taozi said, “Pavilion Master gave me a new flame. After I swallowed it, it became a green spiritual fire.”

“I see.”Qin Yu suddenly understood.

While they were talking, Little Qing and Zhang Yi Jiu walked in from outside.

Seeing Little Qing, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel ashamed.

Back then, Qin Yu promised Little Qing that when they attacked the second secret realm, he would bring her along and let her reunite with her family.

But no one expected that there would be a fork in the middle. The Sky Blood Rainbow suddenly attacked and caused the second secret realm to bleed like a river, including Little Qing’s family.

“Yo, Qin Yu, why are you here? What a rare guest,”Zhang Yi Jiu said with a somewhat strange tone.

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “I’m an elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. Why Can’t I Come?”

“Tch, you’re a very busy person,”Zhang Yi Jiu said with a roll of his eyes.

Qin Yu Ku Xiong shook his head. Then, he looked at Little Qing.

“Little Qing, about the second mystic realm... I can only apologize to you.”Qin Yu sighed slightly, and there was a hint of guilt in his voice.

Little Qing shook her head and said in a low voice, “I heard about it. It’s not your fault. It’s all because of the sky blood rainbow...”

Even though that was the case, Qin Yu knew that if he had not attacked the second mystic realm, such a tragedy would not have happened.

Qin Yu did not say much to comfort her, but he made up his mind that he would find a way to compensate little Qing in the future.

That day, Qin Yu had a meal with Taozi, Little Qing, and the fifth elder.

The next morning, Qin Yu said goodbye to the Pavilion Master and left the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, preparing to enter closed-door cultivation.

I don’t know how long this closed-door cultivation will take. The fastest is five days, or at most a few days. Qin Yu thought to himself.

I have to find an absolutely safe place

The Secret Realm in the Heaven Gate was obviously unable to guarantee Qin Yu’s safety.

Qin Yu thought about it and finally cast his gaze to the bottom of the sea.
