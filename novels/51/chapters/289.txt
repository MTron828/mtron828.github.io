Chapter 290: The Furious Han Wei! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

But very quickly, the Divine Alchemist Pavilion reacted.

Their alchemists were all over the country. It must be a member of the Divine Alchemist pavilion refining a pill.

In Gu Taichu’s mansion, pills popped out one after another in Qin Yu’s hand.

Five minutes later, Qin Yu had a total of eight Vitality Enhancing Pills in his hand!

“Eight pills isn’t bad,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

According to the records in the inheritance, Vitality Enhancing Pills greatly increased one’s strength.

Qin Yu had also absorbed the divine sense of the Earth Fiend Valley’s ancestor. It shouldn’t be a big problem for him to enter the Monastic Stage.

Gu Taichu and Yao Qing quietly waited outside the door.

They didn’t know what was going on inside. They only knew that Qin Yu was refining a pill.

Half a minute later, the wooden door opened.

Qin Yu held eight Vitality Enhancing Pills in his hand, and a smile appeared on his face.

“Qin Yu, how’s the situation?” Gu Taichu asked.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “It went very smoothly, but I’m afraid I’ll have to trouble you to protect me from now on.”

Gu Taichu nodded slightly and said, “Of course, there’s no problem.”

Qin Yu glanced around and asked in a deep voice, “Is there a relatively spacious place?”

Gu Taichu asked in confusion, “A relatively spacious place?”

Qin Yu explained, “I’m afraid that there will be a heavenly tribulation when I break through.”

This sentence reminded Gu Taichu!

Divine cultivation was a heaven-defying act. Naturally, it would trigger heavenly tribulation.

Usually, only after one stepped into the Nascent Soul Stage would the heavenly tribulation be triggered.

However, there were also rumors that a genius would trigger the heavenly tribulation when he broke through to the Foundation Establishment Stage.

Gu Taichu thought for a moment and said, “Okay, follow me.”

Gu Taichu brought Qin Yu out of the mansion.

After going around in circles, the three of them arrived at a mountain range together.

“Usually, no one will come here. You can break through here,” Gu Taichu said.

Qin Yu glanced at the surrounding environment. After making sure that nothing would be damaged, he nodded.

He found a place to sit down and stuffed the Vitality Enhancing Pill into his mouth as he began to break through to the Foundation Establishment Stage.

At the same time, the Jiang Bei Martial Arts Association’s video had been successfully produced and successfully released.

The instant this news was released, it caused an uproar on the entire Martial Arts Forum!

For them, it was practically mind-blowing for a lowly commoner to provoke the Han family!

“Who is Qin Yu? He actually dares to provoke Young Master Han?”

“F * ck, this is too ridiculous!”

“We really pale in comparison. We’re afraid of provoking an aristocratic family like the Han family, yet he took the initiative to provoke them!”

“I remember now. Qin Yu seems to be that King of Chuzhou that caused a sensation not too long ago!”

In an instant, almost everyone was watching this news!

And the number of comments instantly reached more than 10,000!

When the Jiang Bei Martial Arts Association saw so many views, they couldn’t help but feel excited!

“Ruodan, you did well this time! This month’s bonus will be doubled for you!” The director of the news department said excitedly.

Li Ruodan was immediately overjoyed and hurriedly said, “Thank you, director!”

This news continued to spread, and almost everyone was discussing this matter.

They admired Qin Yu’s actions, but they also felt that Qin Yu was sending himself to his death.

“You have to know that Han Wei is a famous genius in Jingdu. With the Han family’s resources and background... Tsk Tsk, it’s hard to imagine.”

“Qin Yu represents the class of us ordinary people. I actually hope that he can win.”

“Who doesn’t hope so? These aristocratic families rely on their connections and powerful background to oppress us ordinary people. I’ve had enough.”

“That being said, can Qin Yu really do it?”

“Maybe he’s the next Ye Qing.”

...

At this moment, in the Han family’s home in Jingdu, Han Wei was meditating. In front of him were all sorts of top-grade herbs and pills.

Han Wei, he could almost eat these top-grade pills like candy.

As long as he was talented enough, the Han family could use an endless amount of resources to turn Han Wei into a top-notch martial artist.

At this moment, the door was suddenly opened!

A 40-year-old man ran in in a panic.

Han Wei’s eyes suddenly opened!

A terrifying internal qi made the middle-aged man vomit blood!

“Didn’t I say that when I’m meditating, don’t disturb me?!” Han Wei said coldly.

The man struggled to get up from the ground and said with a trembling voice, “I’m... I’m sorry, Young Master Han, but... I have an important piece of news that I have to tell you.”

Han Wei snorted and said, “What news is so important?”

“You’d better see for yourself...” The man took out his phone shakily and placed it on Han Wei’s subway.

Han Wei glanced at the phone, and then his face flushed!

“Qin Yu is simply courting death!” Han Wei smashed the phone into pieces!

He said angrily, “A lowly reptile actually dares to challenge me. Who does he think he is? What right does he have to challenge me?!”

To an aristocratic family like Han Wei’s, being challenged was a great sin!

The middle-aged man at the side trembled without daring to make a sound.

Han Wei clenched his fists tightly and said coldly, “Do you really think that with Yan Ruoxue protecting you, I won’t dare to do anything?! I will go to Jiang Bei right now and crush you to death!”

“Young Master, please don’t be rash!” The man hurriedly stopped Han Wei.

He said with a trembling voice, “Qin Yu said that if he dies, it must be because you’re afraid that he will become stronger.”

“If you make a move now, it’s equivalent to acquiescence.”

“When that time comes, the Han family might be ridiculed by the entire martial arts world...”

These words instantly made Han Wei even angrier! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

He simply couldn’t imagine that a dignified son of an aristocratic family would actually be toyed with like this by a lowly person!

Most importantly, even if he was angry inside, there was nothing he could do!

Han Wei was actually forced into a situation where he couldn’t back down by Qin Yu.

“Furthermore... I heard that Old Mister Yan seems to have high hopes for Qin Yu,” the man added.

Hearing these words, Han Wei finally calmed down.

Although the Han family wasn’t inferior to the Yan family, Old Mister Yan’s way of doing things made the entire Jingdu tremble in fear!

Back then, the Sun family, which was also a top-tier aristocratic family, was forced out of Jingdu by Old Mister Yan because they humiliated Yan Ruoxue!

Even Han Wei was unwilling to provoke a person who wouldn’t give up until he achieved his goal.

“Phew...” Han Wei took a deep breath and forcefully suppressed the anger inside.

“Okay. I’ll satisfy him!” Han Wei said in an ice-cold tone.

“Half a year later, I’ll personally kill this b*stard!”

...

In Jingdu, the Yan family’s home, Yan Ruoxue looked at the news on the Martial Arts Forum, and a relieved smile appeared on her face.

At this time, Old Mister Yan walked in from outside.

He said with a smile, “Ruoxue, what are you so happy about?”

Yan Ruoxue handed the phone to Old Mister Yan and said with a smile, “Grandfather, Qin Yu’s courage and wit have far exceeded our imagination. I really didn’t misjudge him.”

“Oh really?” Old Mister Yan seemed to be a little surprised.

He took the phone and looked at the content on the screen.
