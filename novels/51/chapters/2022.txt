2023 The Invisible Killing Formation Activated

Elder Si’s expression was solemn, and he was even more determined to eliminate the root of the problem!

Rumble…

The dark clouds seemed to have formed a connection with Elder Si’s palm. A violent and terrifying power of lightning was forming in his hand!

It was like numerous densely packed lightning snakes sticking out their forked tongues. The manic power made people feel uneasy.

“Go to hell!”

Elder Si’s hair blew wildly in the wind as he shouted angrily repeatedly. He pushed his palm forward, and bolts of lightning with the power of heavenly retribution shot toward Qin Yu!

Facing this terrifying power, Qin Yu showed no fear. He raised his head and roared, his strength bursting to the extreme!

Golden light continuously surged. Qin Yu’s fists contained a destructive power that swept across everything as if it was crushing dry weeds and rotten wood!

Bolts of lightning continuously cracked and shattered under Qin Yu’s Golden Light. Qin Yu, stepping on the line word formula, succeeded in his every endeavor and shattered all obstructions!

Boom!

An even more intense shockwave erupted. The golden fist collided with the lightning. It was as if it wanted to tear the entire world apart.

The dark clouds in the sky became even more imposing. Lightning flashed as if it was the end of the world.

The entire space turned golden and purple. It was so dazzling that it made people not dare to look at it directly!

Once again, Qin Yu shattered the purple lightning!

Even though the radiance on Qin Yu’s fist had dimmed a little, it was enough to shock everyone!

“Impossible!” Elder Si’s eyes revealed a deep shock. He could not believe his eyes. Qin Yu actually blocked the second stage of the Nine Netherworld Thunder Retribution!

Qin Yu’s fist was as steady as Mount Tai amid the lightning. The manic lightning seemed to have lost its power in front of him.

The surrounding air instantly quieted down, and the collapsing void seemed to have stopped shattering at this moment.

Everyone was stunned, as they had never thought that Qin Yu could actually withstand the second stage of the Nine Netherworld Thunder Retribution!

“Could it be… Qin Yu is really the chosen one?” someone exclaimed.

“Who is he actually? How did he do such a thing?” another person sighed with emotion and said.

“Elder Si, the second stage of your Nine Netherworld Thunder Retribution is only so-so,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Elder Si gritted his teeth. Although he was unwilling to admit it, the truth was right in front of him.

Qin Yu’s strength had indeed far exceeded his imagination.

“Little b*stard, don’t feel so smug. This battle is not over yet!” Elder Si gritted his teeth.

Looking at Elder Si, Qin Yu could not help but shake his head, sigh, and say, “Unfortunately, the duration of the sixth level of the fighting word formula is too short. Otherwise… I might be able to kill you without the help of the Endless Killing Formation. Semi-Saint is nothing.”

After saying this, the internal qi on Qin Yu’s body began dissipating, and the golden light grew dim instantly.

“Hmm? What’s going on?” someone frowned and said.

“It seems that the time of Qin Yu’s special technique is up!”

Seeing this, Elder Si laughed crazily and said, “Qin Yu, let’s see how you can defeat me! Hahaha!”

Qin Yu sighed and said with pity, “If only the sixth level of the fighting word formula had advanced a little more. What a pity.”

As soon as Qin Yu finished speaking, he slowly raised his palm.

The surrounding killing intent instantly surged toward Qin Yu’s sides. Then Qin Yu’s body seemed to have fused with the Endless Killing Formation!

“He’s going to use the Endless Killing Formation!” someone exclaimed.

“He fuses himself with the Endless Killing Formation. As long as the killing formation exists, Qin Yu will exist. If the killing formation is broken, Qin Yu will die!”

“This kid has such terrifying attainments in formations!”

Under everyone’s shocked gazes, Qin Yu’s body began growing dim. He had fused with the Endless Killing Formation. As long as the killing formation was not broken, Qin Yu was invincible!

However, this required a tremendously strong mental strength to control it. If not careful, Qin Yu might suffer the backlash of this killing formation!

Especially Qin Yu had used dragon blood to activate this formation, the demand for mental strength was even greater!

“D*mn!” Elder Si frowned. At this moment, he was like losing his target and could not hit Qin Yu at all.

“Elder Si, destroy the formation!” someone shouted.

Elder Si did not dare to be negligent. He immediately activated the third stage of the Nine Netherworld Thunder Retribution and blasted it toward the entire formation!

However, under Qin Yu’s control, this formation seemed to have a life of its own! The killing intent in the killing formation rose like a sharp blade and easily cut off the Nine Netherworld Thunder Retribution!

“Rise!”

A voice came from all directions of the formation. It was Qin Yu’s voice!

This place was originally a large cemetery, so the killing intent was naturally even more terrifying. Qin Yu had borrowed the power of heaven and earth to construct the Endless Killing Formation. Its power was definitely incredibly terrifying!

“D*mn!!”

Elder Si’s expression was tremendously ugly. For a moment, he was like a headless chicken!

“Hurry up and break the formation! Break the formation!” Elder Si hurriedly shouted!

To break the formation, he had to locate the formation cores.

However, the formation cores were hidden like a ghost in this Endless Killing Formation. It appeared and disappeared at times, making it difficult to grasp.

Moreover, to prevent the formation from being broken, Qin Yu had already performed a hidden treatment on every formation core. It was impossible to break the formation in a short time!

Feeling the invisible killing intent approaching, Elder Si was burning with anxiety.

Out of desperation, he grasped the power of lightning in his hand and began to attack randomly, constantly blasting in all directions!

...

“I’m going to destroy your entire formation!” Elder Si roared.

Unfortunately, the most powerful feature of the Endless Killing Formation was that it could only be removed by breaking the formation. Other forces could not affect this formation at all! FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Buzz!”

A killing intent rushed straight toward Elder Si’s face! This invisible killing intent was impossible to grasp, so Elder Si could only rely on his senses to dodge it!

However, in the Endless Killing Formation, killing intent was everywhere. It could kill people without any form and there was nowhere to hide!

“Rip!”

A killing intent as sharp as a blade tore through Elder Si’s chest!

Blood gushed out like a fountain, forcing Elder Si to step back a few steps!

A few bones were exposed on his chest. If one looked closely, one could notice several bones in his chest had been broken!

“Elder Si, this formation consumes a lot of mental energy. Qin Yu won’t be able to control it for long. Hang in there!” someone outside shouted at this moment.

“That’s right. As long as you can endure it, Qin Yu will fail to control this formation!”

...

Hearing their voices, Elder Si gritted his teeth and shouted angrily, “F*ck you! So what if the formation goes out of control? I’ll still die inside here!”

After the formation went out of control, the power would only become more violent. At that time, at most, Qin Yu and Elder Si would die in the formation!

“Elder Si, there’s no other way now. Use a protective technique to protect yourself for the time being. We’ll take the opportunity to find the formation core to break this formation!” the attendant outside shouted again.

Elder Si gritted his teeth. He obviously had no better idea at this moment.
