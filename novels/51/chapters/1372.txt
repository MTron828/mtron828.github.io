Chapter 1373: Chapter 1,373, heading to Mount Hua Ning

Ding Jie fell silent.

Although his expression was still as cold as ever, there was a hint of conflict in his eyes.

It was obvious that he had been persuaded by Qin Yu.

“You want your sect master to be kept in the dark for the rest of his life? Even if you think that I deserve to die, shouldn’t the person behind it deserve to die?”Qin Yu questioned coldly.

Ding Jie took a deep breath. He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “I can promise you, but let me tell you, I will still tell your position to the sect master.”

“F * ck you! Why Are You So Shameless!”Wen Da couldn’t help but come up and scold him.

Ding Jie ignored Wen Da and Wen Er. Instead, he stared at Qin Yu in front of him. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Qin Yu spread her hands and said, “Of course. Suit yourself.”

“To tell you the truth, I have already sent someone to inform the great elder of your location. I believe that it won’t be long before the great elder arrives here,”Ding Jie continued.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He estimated that this place was not close to the Heavenly Cloud sect. It would probably take some time for the great elder to arrive.

Therefore, Qin Yu let go of Ding Jie and said, “Remember, observe elder Bai more. He is the biggest suspect.”

Ding Jie looked at Qin Yu in front of him and said, “Are you really going to let me go?”

“Hurry up and get lost!”Wen Er waved his hand and said.

Ding Jie snorted. He didn’t say anything and turned to leave.

After he left, Qin Yu hurriedly looked at Wen Da and Wen Er.

“Pack up. Let’s go.”Qin Yu’s tone was somewhat anxious.

“Where are We Going?”Wen Da asked in confusion.

Qin Yu said, “To Mount Hua Ning to find Jue Wu.”

“AH? Isn’t Aunt Jue Wu in seclusion?”The two brothers didn’t understand Qin Yu’s intention.

Qin Yu stopped what he was doing, he said in a deep voice, “I’ve thought about it. The reason why Ding Jie could find us is because of the two of you. He can capture your aura and find my position. Therefore, we have to move separately.”

Wen Da opened his mouth and was about to speak, but was interrupted by Qin Yu with a wave of her hand.

“I’ll send you to Mount Hua Ning. At that time, I’ll leave immediately. The target of the Heavenly Cloud Sect is me. The two of you are not important. I believe that they won’t barge into Mount Hua Ning for the sake of two insignificant people,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Wen Da and Wen er seemed to understand what Qin Yu meant.

“Then what about you?”Wen Da asked with a frown.

“Don’t worry. I don’t have any spiritual energy fluctuations in my body. It’s not difficult for me to hide,”Qin Yu said.

“Don’t waste any more time. We’ll leave now.”

Wen Da and Wen Er didn’t dare to waste any more time. They immediately followed behind Qin Yu and quickly left the place.

Mount Hua Ning wasn’t very far from here. With the support of the wind chasing colt, they spent a short two days to arrive at the foot of Mount Hua Ning.

This was a high mountain surrounded by clouds and mist. It looked like a heavenly palace.

Qin Yu had never expected that the unruly and unruly jue Wu would live in such a place with such artistic conception.

“TSK TSK, one really can’t judge a book by its cover,”Qin Yu sighed.

“Aunt Jue Wu likes flowers. Hua Ning Mountain is covered with flowers,”Wen da said.

The three of them immediately walked up the mountain.

As soon as they reached the top of the mountain, they saw two youths blocking Qin Yu’s path.

The two youths were a man and a woman. They wore white clothes and held treasured swords in their hands. They had delicate features.

“Lord Jue Wu has gone into seclusion. Please leave,”the youth said coldly.

Qin Yu pointed at Wen Da and Wen er and said, “They are Wen Wanji’s grandchildren. They want to come here to seek refuge for a few days.”

Hearing this, the pair of youths couldn’t help but frown.

It was obvious that they knew Wen Wanyi.

“But Master Jiewu is in seclusion, so it’s not convenient to meet guests...”the youth’s tone was much gentler.

Qin Yu cupped her hands and said, “Don’t worry. They won’t disturb Jiewu’s seclusion. It’s enough as long as they stay here.”

“This... I’m afraid we can’t make the decision.”The youth looked extremely conflicted.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “If anything happens, I’ll be responsible.”

“Aiya, don’t worry. Aunt Juewu will definitely agree,”Wen Dawen er also said.

Seeing this, the youth could only nod and say, “Alright then. But you must remember that you must never disturb Lord Juewu’s cultivation.”

“Don’t Worry!”Wen Dawen er patted his chest and said.

After sending the two of them off, Qin Yu didn’t stay any longer. He immediately turned around and rushed towards Yang City.

The mountain range in Yang City might be Qin Yu’s last hope.

Even if he was really discovered by the people of the Heavenly Cloud sect, Qin Yu could still hide in the mountain range.

Heavenly Cloud sect.

The first elder quickly rushed to Kang City. According to the location given by Ding Jie, he smelled Wen Dawen er’s aura.

“They have already left,”said the attendant beside him.

The great elder nodded and said indifferently, “It doesn’t matter. As long as they are in this world, I will definitely be able to find their traces.”

“Moreover, they haven’t gone far.”

The great elder didn’t say much. He immediately released his powerful spiritual sense and began to search for the traces left behind by Wen Da Wen Er.

As expected, the great elder, whose spiritual sense was extremely powerful, quickly caught the auras left behind by these two people.
