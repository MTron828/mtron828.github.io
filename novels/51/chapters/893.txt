Chapter 894: Chapter 894, Breakthrough 

The glazed ice heart hung above Yan Ruoxue’s head.

The moment the heaven swallowing technique was used, the glazed ice heart turned into a stream of light and covered Yan Ruoxue’s body!

The stream of light seemed to have merged with Yan Ruoxue’s body and slowly sank into her snow-white skin.

Qin Yu could not help but widen his eyes and exclaimed, “This... this is swallowing?”

Yan Ruoxue was also at a loss. She looked left and right and said carefully, “Did I lose it?”

Qin Yu waved his hand repeatedly and said, “No, no, no, of course not...”

Even Qin Yu didn’t know how to explain such a situation.

“Could it be... related to the bloodline in your body?”Qin Yu scratched his head and said tentatively.

“Do you feel any discomfort? Or... is it abnormal?”Qin Yu continued to ask.

Yan Ruoxue shook her head and said, “I don’t think so...”

Qin Yu scratched his head.

Could it be that this ice glaze heart would choose its own master?

Palace Master Han Palace spent decades but still failed to swallow the ice glaze heart.

Qin Yu also spent more than a month but also failed.

However, Yan Ruoxue absorbed the ice and snow glazed heart in an instant. This was simply unimaginable.

“I really don’t know what the bloodline of the Yan family is...”Qin Yu became more and more curious.

Old Mister Yan said that it was his father who predicted Yan Ruoxue’s bloodline and said that this bloodline was extremely overbearing.

Now, it seemed that all of this could be true.

This bloodline of the Yan family was probably not inferior to his own chaotic body.

“Ruoxue, try to cultivate diligently during this period of time and see what kind of state you can reach.”Qin Yu said with a serious expression.

Yan ruoxue nodded and said with a smile, “Alright, I’ll listen to you.”

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude. He did not say anything else. He took out the Yin heart from the spatial divine tool and began to absorb the yin qi.

He circulated his meridians to circulate the mental cultivation method and prepared to break through to the half-step martial saint stage.

After Yan ruoxue received Qin Yu’s “Order”, she also began to cultivate in seclusion wholeheartedly.

In the vast mystic realm, only Li Yu appeared to be bored.

His talent in cultivation was not high, but his comprehension ability towards the mystic realm was extremely strong.

Thus, Li Yu tried to make up for the flaw in this mystic realm.

Unfortunately, Li Yu spent several days of effort and ultimately failed.

“Sigh, if I want to make up for the flaw in the mystic realm, I’m afraid I’ll need the help of an almighty...”Li Yu sighed in his heart.

Time passed extremely quickly.

In the blink of an eye, another month passed.

On this day, in the high-level meeting room of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, Gu Xinghe was lowering his head, waiting for the arrival of the high-level officials.

A few minutes later, several higher-ups arrived in the office.

At the same time, a mystic realm master also walked in.

“He is a high-grade mystic realm master, Du Xuanyu. He controls 89,000 secret keys. 99% of the Mystic Realms in the world can be cracked,”a higher-up said.

“You have at most one month to find Yan Ruoxue!”

The voice of the higher-ups was extremely stern, and no one dared to refute it.

Gu Xinghe quickly stood up and said, “Yes, sir.”

“At most a month. If we can’t find her after a month, I’m afraid we’ll never be able to touch her bloodline.”There was some worry in the tone of the higher-ups.

This was the first time Gu Xinghe felt the worry of the higher-ups!

“Sir, may I ask why?”Gu Xinghe frowned and asked.

“Could it be that Yan Ruoxue will disappear from the world in a month?”

The higher-ups were silent for a moment, then said in a low voice, “Disappear from the world... it’s about time.”

This made Gu Xinghe even more confused. He wanted to ask something, but was violently interrupted.

“Remember, our first goal is to find Yan Ruoxue! No matter who finds her, we must find her as soon as possible!”The higher-ups said coldly.

“Even if Yan Ruoxue falls into the hands of others, we must find her within a month!”

Hearing the nervous tone of the higher-ups, Gu Xinghe did not dare to be negligent and hurriedly shouted, “Yes!”

Then, Gu Xinghe brought du Xuanyu out of the meeting room.

“Mr. Du, if that Qin Yu enters the ownerless secret area, can you find him too?”Gu Xinghe asked in a deep voice.

Du xuanyu said indifferently, “I’m a high-grade mystic realm master and am extremely sensitive to mystic realms. As long as I have enough time, I will definitely be able to find him.”

Gu Xinghe bowed and said, “Then I’ll have to trouble you, Mr. Du.”

Then, Gu Xinghe led du Xuanyu and began a thorough search.

The people from the various mystic realms all used their unique skills, and the most despicable one was undoubtedly Wan guqiong. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Wan Gu Qiong had dug out all the connections with Qin Yu and planned to kill all the people around him one by one!

...

In a flash, Qin Yu had entered the secret realm for three whole months.

On this day.

Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes. The Yin heart hanging above his head also fluctuated intensely for no reason.

“It seems that I am about to enter the half-step martial Saint Realm.”Qin Yu stood up and said in a low voice.

He looked at Yan Ruoxue who was sitting next to him.

At this moment, Yan Ruoxue was breathing exercise slowly.

Her breathing was extremely stable, so stable that one could not feel any fluctuations.

Yan Ruoxue seemed to have a natural compatibility with the Qi/spiritual energy. As she breathed and breathed, all the Qi/spiritual energy could not help but surge into her body.

“At this speed, Ruoxue will soon step into the martial grandmaster realm...”Qin Yu murmured in a low voice.

This speed really made Qin Yu feel ashamed and shocked.

And the last time Qin Yu was so shocked was Xiao Yu.

The cultivation speed of the two of them was far above his own.

Qin Yu put away his yin heart and carefully walked into the distance.

It was not until he came to a no man’s land that Qin Yu slowly let out a breath.

“Stepping into the half-step martial saint realm will not usher in the heavenly tribulation, but the golden core will notice the change,”Qin Yu thought in his heart.

The half-step martial saint realm was a transition period for a martial marquis to become a martial saint, and the Golden Core would also quietly change at this moment.

Qin Yu’s golden core had left a wound, which made him slightly worried.

“I hope I can survive it,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

He closed his eyes slightly and began to try to break through.

Wisps of internal Qi were only released from his dantian.

At this moment, the golden core in his body slowly began to rotate.

The speed of the Golden Core’s rotation became faster and faster. The sea-like power in Qin Yu’s body could not help but surge out!

The strands of internal QI flowed out of the cracks in the golden core in different ways!

Under the drive of this power, the surrounding environment was also greatly affected!

“Hu!”

Gusts of strong wind swept up, and the mountains and trees were instantly shaken into fine powder!
