Chapter 1396: Chapter 1396, encountering the green creature 1 again

Boss Zheng’s expression changed slightly. He shook his head hurriedly and said, “It has nothing to do with her. Absolutely nothing!”

But how could boss Zheng’s change of mood escape the Great Elder’s eyes? He quickly realized that this matter had something to do with sister Lin.

“I advise you to tell me the truth,”said the great elder coldly.

“Even if you don’t tell me, I can go to Gu City to arrest her right now!”

Boss Zheng didn’t know what to do. He had promised Qin Yu that he would never involve sister Lin, but the current situation was not under his control.

“Okay, then you don’t have to say it. I will investigate it myself,”said the great elder coldly.

“But let me tell you, when I find out, sister Lin Must Die! This is your last chance!”

After saying this, the great elder turned and left.

“Wait!”

Finally, boss Zheng could not hold on any longer.

He gritted his teeth and said, “Then swear that you will never hurt her!”

Although boss Zheng’s strength was weak, he knew the importance of the cultivation realm.

Without thinking, the great elder nodded and said, “I swear that I will never hurt her! My target is Qin Yu, not her.”

Hearing this, boss Zheng was slightly relieved. He immediately told the great elder what happened.

After the great elder heard it, his eyes couldn’t help but narrow.

“He dared to come to Gu city... it seems that he already knows the news,”said the great elder coldly.

As a figure of the Heavenly Cloud sect, the Great Elder’s mind was very clear. He soon figured out Qin Yu’s intention.

The Great Elder took a deep breath and said, “Alright, I got it. You can leave now.”

Boss Zheng said worriedly, “You mustn’t go to sister Lin. I promised her!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Don’t worry.”The great elder waved his hand.

After chasing boss Zheng away, a trace of anger appeared on the Great Elder’s face.

He said coldly, “Wait until I find out. None of you will be able to escape!”

...

On the other side, Qin Yu followed Brother Dao as they walked deeper into the karst cave.

The deeper they went, the more familiar Qin Yu felt.

“Is it that thing?”

At this moment, tie Dan suddenly exclaimed in his mind.

Qin Yu replied, “What do you mean?”

Tie Dan did not reply. No matter how Qin Yu asked, he did not respond.

As they were getting closer to their destination, their vision started to blur.

This blurriness made people mistake it for mist, but the smell was very thick.

It was at this moment that Qin Yu confirmed his guess.

This aura was exactly the same as the one he had encountered in the Yangcheng mountain range! It was the aura that had been turned into demonic qi by the locals!

“Brother Dao, is there something guarding the vicinity of the water of life?”Qin Yu asked.

Brother Dao grunted and said, “It should be a guardian beast.”

“Then what does it look like?”Qin Yu asked.

Brother Dao said in a deep voice, “Its body is wrapped in fog, so I can’t see it clearly. I only know that its body is extremely huge, and the sense of oppression is extremely strong.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said in a low voice, “It really is that thing.”

“You know it?”Brother Dao looked at Qin Yu in surprise.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “Although I don’t know his origin, I have seen it before.”

The aura here was not dense, which was enough to show that there were not many green creatures here.

However, Qin Yu could not figure out whether these green creatures were born from this aura, or whether this aura was emitted from their bodies?

That unconscious yet extremely cold feeling made even Qin Yu shudder.

“Could it be that the aura of life is related to this aura?”Qin Yu thought to himself.

The water of life in this karst cave was accompanied by the green creature, and so was Yang City. One couldn’t help but think of it together.

“Where did this aura of life come from...”Qin Yu couldn’t figure it out.

Not only Qin Yu, but even tie Dan didn’t know anything about it.

They only knew the effect of the Qi of life, but they didn’t know the origin of the Qi of life.

“We’ll be there soon.”Brother Dao’s footsteps slowly became steady.

The aura around him also became slightly denser.

“Wait for me here.”Qin Yu looked at Brother Dao.

Brother Dao frowned and said, “That guardian beast is extremely powerful. I almost died in his hands. If I didn’t run fast, I would have become a corpse by now. You...”

“I know.”Qin Yu interrupted Brother Dao.

He took a deep breath and directly opened the fifth level of the fighting word formula.

Although there was no spiritual power fluctuation in Qin Yu’s body, Brother Dao still felt the powerful pressure from Qin Yu’s body.

“Fighting formula?”Tie Dan who was in his mind was extremely surprised.

“You should be careful when using this unique skill. If it is discovered by others, it might cause chaos,”tie Dan said.

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude. He immediately opened his desolate divine eye and looked into the depths of the cave.

A huge figure soon appeared in his field of vision.
