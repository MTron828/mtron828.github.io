Chapter 821: The Arrival of Gu Xinghe

When he saw it, he realized that this token was the key to the Scripture Pavilion. There seemed to be some special talisman on it.

Qin Yu stared at the token in his hand and couldn’t help but narrow his eyes.

“It would be great if I could steal this token,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Xia Hang held the token in his hand and slowly put it toward the door.

However, at this moment, a hand suddenly reached out and grabbed Xia Hang’s wrist.

“Who allowed you to bring people to the Scripture Pavilion?”

A clear voice sounded in everyone’s ears.

Turning around, they saw a young man looking at Xia Hang with a smile that wasn’t a smile.

Beside him were three old men.

Xia Hang frowned slightly and said, “Who are you? Who allowed you to come here?”

The young man said lightly, “I am Gu Xinghe, the son of the second Mystic Realm’s master!”

“At the same time, I am also the successor of Granny Qin’s position!”

Hearing this, everyone present frowned immediately.

Qin Yu was no exception. He sized up Gu Xinghe, and his expression was slightly unsightly.

“So it’s Young Master Gu.” Xia Hang quickly bowed in greeting.

Gu Xinghe said coldly, “Xia Hang, who allowed you to bring them to the Scripture Pavilion?”

Xia Hang hesitated for a moment, then said, “This is the request of all the students, and... At present, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association is indeed in my hands.”

Gu Xinghe snorted coldly, “Since I’m here, then naturally, I have the final say here.”

Then, he swept his gaze over everyone and said nonchalantly, “You guys can go back. The Scripture Pavilion doesn’t allow anyone to enter.”

A flash of anger flashed across everyone’s faces.

“Young Master Gu, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association has already promised us, and now they want to go back on their word?” Someone questioned coldly.

Gu Xinghe narrowed his eyes and snorted coldly, “Promised you? Who promised you? Xia Hang can’t represent the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”

“Young Master Gu, are you playing with us?” Many young masters of the aristocratic families sounded somewhat displeased.

Gu Xinghe could naturally hear the anger in their words.

He snorted and then said calmly, “I know that you are all some kind of genius of the current era. All of you possess unique skills and are proud and arrogant.”

“However, I’m very sorry. That bit of ability of yours is simply not enough in front of me!”

“Therefore, I advise you to put away that lofty attitude of yours!”

When these words were said, everyone was shocked!

As the young masters of the top aristocratic families in Jingdu, they had never suffered such humiliation before!

Even Granny Qin from before treated them with great respect!

Qin Yu, who stood at the side, was delighted to see this.

He crossed his arms and looked at this scene with a nonchalant smile.

“These young masters of the aristocratic families are all arrogant. I didn’t expect that there would be a day when they would be looked down upon,” Qin Yu sneered inside.

He took two steps back and looked at them quietly.

At this moment, Kong Yun took a step forward and said coldly, “So what if you come from the second Mystic Realm? I don’t think you are superior in any way!”

Gu Xinghe looked at Kong Yun coldly and said, “Do you want to die?”

Kong Yun shouted, “I’m not afraid of you!”

As he spoke, his entire body burst into flames. He didn’t hide his strength at the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm!

However, Gu Xinghe mocked, “You dare to act rashly in front of me with such little ability?”

“F * ck you!” Gu Xinghe shouted loudly and took a step forward!

He held the flames in his hand and shot out rays of light in all directions as he threw a punch at Gu Xinghe!

However, Gu Xinghe remained unmoved. With a cold smile on his face, he raised his palm and casually sent a palm forward to meet it.

“Boom!”

At the instant of the collision, an earth-shattering sound was heard!

Kong Yun was instantly forced back a few steps, and his palm cracked open!

This caused people’s expressions to change greatly!

Kong Yun was one of the strongest among them. Other than Yan Jinyao, Kong Yun was the number one person!

But now, he was actually so weak in front of Gu Xinghe!

“Is that all you have?” Gu Xinghe mocked. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Indeed, the martial arts of the current era has declined. When the cat’s away, the mice will play.”

Kong Yun said furiously, “Again!”

“Even if we fight ten more times, you’re still not powerful enough!” Gu Xinghe shouted coldly!

Then, the pressure from Gu Xinghe’s body spread out!

After sensing the powerful internal qi from his body, everyone’s expressions changed drastically!

“Half-step Martial Saint!” Someone was the first to cry out!

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

“They really did send a half-step Martial Saint,” Qin Yu said while stroking his chin.

Gu Xinghe was quite satisfied when he saw everyone’s shocked expression.

He smiled nonchalantly and said, “Do you know the difference in strength now? If anyone isn’t convinced, feel free to come forward and experience it.”

For a moment, no one dared to speak.

“F * ck you...”

Kong Yun was about to curse when he was stopped by Zhuang Teng.

“Brother Kong, you aren’t his match. Just bear with it,” Zhuang Teng said in a low voice.

Although Kong Yun was unwilling, Zhuang Teng and Chu Heng held onto his arm tightly, making him unable to move.

“A bunch of ants and maggots, leave this place immediately,” Gu Xinghe said coldly.

Just as everyone was silent, Qin Yu stepped out.

“Your father is Gu Zizhen?” Qin Yu sneered.

Gu Xinghe raised his eyebrows and said, “Who are you?”

“My name is Qin Yu,” Qin Yu didn’t hide anything.

“You are Qin Yu?” Gu Xinghe was immediately interested.

He sized up Qin Yu and said, “You took Yan Ruoxue away?”

“Yes.” Qin Yu was neither servile nor overbearing.

Gu Xinghe narrowed his eyes and said, “Yan Ruoxue is such a perfect woman, but she actually likes a piece of trash like you... If she were to marry me, would she have to suffer?”

“Are you courting death?” Qin Yu’s expression instantly turned extremely cold.

Hearing this, Gu Xinghe couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows and ask, “What did you say?”

“I said are you courting death?!” Qin Yu took a step forward and a terrifying aura instantly erupted!

Gu Xinghe frowned slightly and snorted coldly. “Qin Yu, since you can break into the second Mystic Realm, it means that you have some ability. I want to experience it...”

Gu Xinghe walked forward at the same time and the internal qi on his body also increased rapidly.

The two of them walked towards each other and very quickly, the two of them stood together.

Their eyes met, and the two internal qi clashed.

The people around quickly took a step back, their expressions complicated.

They both hoped that Qin Yu could win against Gu Xinghe, but they were also afraid that Qin Yu would win against Gu Xinghe.
