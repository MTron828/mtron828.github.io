Sima Bei’s body was bound by chains. The chains flickered with golden light, shining brightly in the darkness.

On the other side of the chains was Zhuo Jing.

Even though Zhuo Jing was heavily injured, he still used all his strength to control the chains.

This chain was left behind by Zhuo Jing’s father. It could be said to be mysterious and unfathomable. Back then, his father had used this item to capture countless top-notch martial artist of the same level.

Now that the chain had been obtained by Zhuo Jing, although he could not display his father’s abilities, he had temporarily controlled Sima Bei.

“Qin Yu, you have to fight for your reputation...”Zhuo Jing said in his heart.

In order to help Qin Yu stall for time, he had used almost all methods and completely offended the northern lands.

Not far away, Sima Bei’s expression became even colder.

He tried to struggle, but discovered that this chain seemed to have embedded itself into his body, and he was unable to break free.

Not far away, Qin Yu was also waiting for the final heavenly tribulation to descend.

He raised his head to stare at the calm sky, and a bad premonition arose in his heart.

“Could it be that the final heavenly tribulation is a divine sense attack?”Qin Yu thought to himself.

If it was a divine sense attack, it would probably be very difficult for Qin Yu to withstand it, because he did not have any magic treasures that could protect his divine sense!

......

“Rumble...”

From time to time, muffled thunder would flash across the sky. It sounded like someone was hiding in the dark clouds and snoring.

“Crash!”

At this moment, a ray of light descended from the sky!

The speed of this light was extremely fast. Even Qin Yu did not have time to react before he was directly drowned by the light!

“Not good!”Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed. He wanted to take out the divine picture, but it was too late!

His entire body was engulfed by the light, but what surprised Qin Yu was that the light did not bring any discomfort. On the contrary, his entire body felt warm.

That feeling was as comfortable as bathing in the sun after passing through a land of ice and snow for a few days.

“What a comfortable feeling...”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice, like a child lying in swaddling clothes.

This warm feeling almost made Qin Yu fall asleep.

He closed his eyes slightly and immersed himself in this comfortable feeling, forgetting all the Pain and troubles.

Just as he was about to fall asleep, his eyes suddenly opened!

“Not good!”Qin Yu suddenly stood up, cold sweat running down his forehead!

He felt the comfort of his body and couldn’t help but feel a little scared.

This was a gentle home. Once immersed in it, it was very likely to destroy one’s Dao Heart!

“That was close...”Qin Yu wiped the sweat from his forehead, and looked at the radiance around him.

The radiance still lingered around him for a long time.

“This radiance... what exactly is going on?”Qin Yu murmured in a low voice, and he had a bad feeling in his heart.

“Qin Yu!”

At this moment, a boorish voice was heard!

Looking over, he saw Chang Mang walking over quickly from not far away.

His entire body was emitting a fiery red radiance. His aura was full of vigor, and the internal Qi in his body made people feel a sense of oppression!

“Chang Mang? !”Qin Yu was instantly overjoyed. He quickly rushed towards Chang Mang and pulled him into his embrace!

“Why are you here?”Qin Yu tried hard to suppress his excitement as he asked.

Chang Mang laughed loudly and said, “I heard about what happened to you, so I rushed over. How was it? I’m not late, am I?”

Qin Yu patted Chang Mang’s shoulder hard and said, “I’m already very happy to be able to see you. Where have you been since you came to the Holy Region?”

“Aiya, let’s not talk about that!”Chang Mang waved his hand and said, “It’s not easy for us to meet each other. We must get drunk today!”

After saying that, he waved his hand and actually set up a dining table in front of Qin Yu.

There were delicacies on the table, as well as nectar and dew.

“Come, quickly sit down and drink him to your heart’s content!”Chang Mang said excitedly.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Not now, I still have a lot of things to do.”

“Aiya, what bullshit matter? I already know about your little matter. Isn’t it just the Heavenly Cloud Sect? After drinking this wine, the two of us brothers will go and tear down that Heavenly Cloud Sect!”Chang Mang said in a carefree manner.

Qin Yu frowned and sighed, “Forget it. I have to quickly transcend the tribulation and kill Sima Bei.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

After saying that, Qin Yu was ready to tell Chang Mang about Sima Bei.

“Qin Yu.”

However, at this moment, a large group of people suddenly appeared in the sky.

They were wearing armor and were riding on an extremely luxurious carriage.

This carriage was many times larger than the heavenly cloud sect. It was like a spaceship.

And the person sitting on the carriage was none other than Yan Ruoxue!

She was wearing a veil and her face was half covered. Her beauty was so unreal.

“Ruoxue... Ruoxue? ! Why... Why are you here?”Qin Yu suddenly stood up and stared at Yan Ruoxue.

Yan ruoxue smiled and said, “Look at the jade pendant on your chest.”

Qin Yu hurriedly looked down. As expected, the jade pendant had been broken!

“It’s this token...”Qin Yu whispered.

Yan ruoxue nodded slightly and said, “The matter of the Heavenly Cloud sect has already been settled by the Yan family. You Don’t have to worry about it. I’m here to bring you to the Yan family.”

“Bring me to the Yan Family?”Qin Yu was stunned.

“That’s right. The Yan family has provided you with the best resources in the entire holy region. They want to create a truly great chaotic body.”Yan Ruoxue said with a chuckle.

“Brother, this is great. You Don’t have to worry and work hard anymore!”Chang Mang hugged Qin Yu’s shoulder.

Qin Yu looked up and saw that the dark clouds in the sky had dissipated, revealing the brilliant sunlight.

The sunlight scattered on his body, making him feel extremely comfortable.

Not far away, Sima bei had already fallen to the ground, bleeding profusely.

Yan ruoxue gently descended from the carriage. She walked to Qin Yu’s side and said with a smile, “Qin Yu, you’ve worked hard during this period of time. It’s time for you to have a good rest. A person can’t live just for cultivation, right?”

Qin Yu felt an indescribable feeling in his heart.

He looked at Yan Ruoxue in front of him and felt his heart tremble.

“Brother, hurry up and eat. We’ll go to the Yan family in a while. We won’t suffer the sins of birds!”Chang Mang pulled Qin Yu and said.

Qin Yu ignored Chang Mang. He looked at Yan Ruoxue in front of him and said in a low voice, “Ruoxue, can you hug me?”

Yan ruoxue smiled lightly and said, “Of course.”

After saying that, she walked in front of Qin Yu and gently held Qin Yu’s shoulder.

Qin Yu’s arm also took the opportunity to pull Yan Ruoxue into his embrace.

“Ruoxue, thank you.”Qin Yu whispered in Yan Ruoxue’s ear.

A trace of pain flashed across his face. In the next second, his fist went straight into Yan Ruoxue’s lower abdomen.

Yan Ruoxue’s eyes immediately widened. A trace of paleness flashed across her snow-white face, and blood seeped out from the corner of her mouth.

“Qin Yu, you...”Yan Ruoxue opened her mouth, and her weak body slowly fell to the ground.
