1895 Who Is Scared?

Since explaining didn’t work, he would stand by Chang Mang’s side without hesitation.

Qin Yu’s actions naturally attracted Yan Yunfan’s attention. He raised his eyebrows, looked at Qin Yu coldly, and said, “Why? Are you going to attack me?”

“If you’re going to attack my friend, I won’t sit still and wait to be defeated,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

“You talk so big! Do you know who I am?” Yan Yunfan said with a cold expression.

“I’m not afraid even if you’re the king of the heavens,” Qin Yu sneered and said.

“You’re courting death.” Yan Yunfan’s expression turned even colder, and a terrifying internal qi emanated from his body.

Qin Yu and Chang Mang were naturally unafraid. The two internal qi collided at this moment.

At this critical moment, Saintess Gu suddenly walked over.

She chuckled and said, “Mr. Yan, we shouldn’t get angry when the sanctum is about to be revealed. It’ll lead to disaster easily.”

After hearing Saintess Gu’s words, Yan Yunfan snorted and said, “For the sake of Saintess Gu, I’ll let you guys off for now.”

After saying this, Yan Yunfan walked to the side.

After he walked away, Qin Yu bowed slightly to Saintess Gu and said, “Thank you, Saintess Gu.”

“I’m not helping you guys. I’m just telling the truth,” Saintess Gu smiled and said.

That said, Qin Yu knew well that a great war was inevitable when the treasure was unearthed.

“D*mn it! What sh*t is this? That condescending manner really makes me unhappy,” Chang Mang couldn’t help but curse.

“Forget it,” Qin Yu laughed and said. “We don’t stoop to their level for now.”

“Mmm,” Chang Mang responded and followed Qin Yu to the side.

After such a commotion, Qin Yu and Chang Mang also became familiar faces in the crowd.

First, he had called out to Saintess Gu and conversed with her. Now, Saintess Gu had turned up to plead for him. It couldn’t help but make people feel suspicious.

“D*mn it! Has Saintess Gu taken a fancy to that brat?”

“Impossible! That brat isn’t even as good-looking as I’m. Who would take a fancy to him?”

“He’s a little ugly, but who knows if he has other merits? Otherwise, Saintess Gu wouldn’t have shown him so much respect.”

Qin Yu’s face darkened when he heard what the people around him said.

“D*mn it! This bunch of b*stards!” Qin Yu could not help but curse.

Chang Mang could not help but laugh. He pulled Qin Yu back and said with a smile, “Why do you bother stooping to their level?”

“Tell me the truth. Am I ugly?” Qin Yu said with his eyes wide open.

Chang Mang waved his hand and said, “They’re just a bunch of people who don’t know their own limitations. Look at the guy who said you’re ugly. He must be at least 180 kilograms. He’s exactly a landmine.”

Qin Yu looked over and found it true. The guy was extremely short and fat, which made him look extremely out of place.

“That’s true.” Qin Yu immediately felt much more comfortable.

He and Chang Mang sat by the side, quietly waiting for the sanctum to open.

Unfortunately, there was only one purple holy robe. As such, Chang Mang had no way of entering.

As time passed, the sanctum was completely unearthed.

This incomplete sanctum was beyond everyone’s imagination. Its size was unimaginable.

At first glance, it was enormously huge, like a restored palace.

The wisps of internal qi it emitted made people feel extremely uncomfortable.

The surrounding people couldn’t help but be shocked and full of emotions. Even the three children of the aristocratic families were stunned.

Only Qin Yu did not look too surprised. After all, he had seen this sanctum in his mind.

As the sanctum opened, Saintess Gu and the others slowly walked near to it.

They knew the entrance to the training hall. Standing there, a few of them were discussing something.

After a while, two more elders walked over.

These two elders had the demeanor of a transcendent beings. They had extraordinary backgrounds.

Seeing the two elders, Saintess Gu and the others bowed slightly to them.

With such etiquette, one could not help but doubt the identity of the two elders.

“Even the children of the aristocratic families are so respectful to them. Who are these two elders? Why have I never heard of them?”

“Are they elders sent by the families?”

“Probably. After all, this sanctum is beyond our estimation. It’s reasonable to send a few elders to accompany them.”

Qin Yu also had doubts. If the great aristocratic families sent people here, they definitely couldn’t take the treasures away even if they were in their hands.

“What kind of rubbish is this?” At this moment, the man with the mustache sneered.

Qin Yu was stunned. He looked at the man with the mustache and said, “Do you know them?”

“Yes, I do,” the man with the mustache said proudly. “They’re the famous Master of Path of Heaven in Zhongzhou.

“Master of Path of Heaven?” Qin Yu was stunned.

The man with the mustache nodded and said, “If you want to enter such a sanctum, you must be led by the Master of Path of Heaven. They can sense the killing formation and avoid it. Otherwise, I’m afraid you will be suppressed by the killing formation.”

The man with the mustache then paused for a moment before he continued, “They’re just a bunch of people with an undeserved reputation. They’re not even worth mentioning compared to me.”

Qin Yu didn’t doubt his words. Although the man with the mustache didn’t look reliable, his sensitivity to treasures was definitely not ordinary people could compare with.

...

“Alright. I should head over too,” Qin Yu said.

“Didn’t you hear what I said?” the man with the mustache beside him laughed. Without the guidance of the Master of Path of Heaven, you’ll surely die if you go in.”

“But don’t I have them?” Qin Yu said with a smile. “I’ll just follow behind them.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“In your dreams. Why would they let you follow them?” the man with the mustache said.

“It doesn’t matter. I’m the chosen one. I’m very lucky. I won’t die,” Qin Yu grinned and said.

After saying this, Qin Yu walked toward the sanctum.

With a thought, the purple holy robe fell on his body.

With the support of the purple holy robe, that internal qi weakened unlimitedly, and the impact on his body was almost negligible.

Qin Yu walked up to Saintess Gu and the others and wanted to step into the sanctum.

However, as soon as Qin Yu got close, Yan Yunfan frowned.

“What are you doing here?” Yan Yunfan’s face darkened.

...

Qin Yu pointed at the sanctum and said, “I’m here for the same reason as you. Why? Does this belong to your family?”

“Didn’t you know the entire Peaceful Land City belongs to the Gu family?” Yan Yunfan squinted his eyes and said.

“Oh! It belongs to the Gu family! I thought it belongs to the Yan family,” Qin Yu laughed and said.

Yan Yunfan was instantly enraged by Qin Yu. He took a step forward and shouted, “Are you courting death? I don’t mind sending you off!”

“F*ck! Who’s scared of you?” Chang Mang, who was not far away, immediately took a few steps forward and came to Qin Yu’s side, enduring that internal qi.
