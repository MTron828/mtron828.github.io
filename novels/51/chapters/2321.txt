2322 Chatting with Old Friend

“How terrifying! Aren’t they Xi Menn and Qin Yu from the Holy Region?”

“Are all the people from the Holy Region so monstrous and terrifying? Who do you think will win this round?”

“Both of them are in the fourth grade, but they have the record of killing a ninth-grade True Saint in seconds. However, from what I can see, Xi Menn is stronger. His sword is unstoppable, and Qin Yu seems to be relying more on treasures.”

Some people analyzed it carefully.

“This isn’t right either. I saw Qin Yu’s body was as hard as black iron, and even Situ Haoyue’s star power couldn’t hurt him. I think Qin Yu will win.”

At this moment, the battle in the sky attracted the attention of countless cultivators.

A battle of this level was something that top-notch cultivators could only encounter by chance. They could comprehend it and cultivate fewer years if they were lucky.

“The world energy is much stronger than previously, and its rules seem to be more complete.”

Qin Yu’s expression was solemn. Xi Menn’s sword had already evolved into a complete world.

Could he block the power of the world?

“One sword, one world.”

Xi Menn opened his eyes and struck out his sword.

“Whoosh!”

Qin Yu took a deep breath, and the chaotic qi surged wildly into the Suo Lin Divine Artifact.

Within the Ten Thousand Spell Breaking Punch, nine gigantic fire dragons circled around him and the punch directly met the sword energy.

“Boom!”

In just an instant, Qin Yu’s fist and the fire dragons were crushed and shattered directly, proving to be no match at all.

How terrifying!

That sword energy arrived before Qin Yu in less than half a breath. In an instant, Qin Yu felt he had arrived in another world.

In this world, there were tens of thousands of people cultivating sword techniques in different places.

They were both clumsy children and powerful great cultivators who looked down on the world.

However, everyone was repeating the same thought, quietly slashing out sword after sword.

Tens of thousands of sword intent transformed into an iron sword at the last moment and slashed down at him.

Suo Lin Venerable Mountain shattered.

Suo Lin Divine Robe shattered.

The sword energy landed on his body, and the terrifying sword intent roamed through his muscles, cutting him into countless pieces.

There was also a sword phantom in his divine sense that slashed at him.

Qin Yu’s muscles squirmed wildly, counteracting the sword energy.

The golden light of the Saintly Body Technique frantically fought against the sword energy, reducing the terrifying power of the sword intent.

In Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness, Qin Yu’s boundless power of divine sense was like seawater flushing that sword intent.

Hundreds of rays of Soul Shattering Golden Radiance slashed at the sword intent and finally crushed it in his sea of consciousness.

No, his body could not withstand it.

Qin Yu’s face revealed a look of shock, and the divine sense spirit bead transformed into a ray of dazzling golden light.

Under the Spiritualization Technique, a giant golden hand appeared on his body.

The giant golden hand gripped the iron sword.

“Boom!”

Qin Yu’s body retreated tens of thousands of meters. Countless divine sense powers and sword energy entangled and shattered. In the end, the sword slowly quieted down.

“Ding!”

A crack appeared on Xi Menn’s iron sword. His face was ashen and he even seemed unable to stand in the air.

Qin Yu’s body moved and grabbed him, bringing him to the peak.

“I lost.

“I have too many magical artifacts on me. I really couldn’t take your sword if it wasn’t for Suo Lin.”

Qin Yu recalled that sword attack just now and was still shocked.

Was this a sword attack that a cultivator of fourth grade could unleash?

If it were Situ Haoyue, he would most likely be killed directly.

“A loss is a loss.” Xi Menn shook his head.

“Haha!”

Qin Yu did not argue with him. He stretched his palm and infused a surge of chaotic qi into Xi Menn’s body.

After some time, Xi Menn slowly recovered.

“You received the message from the Holy Region. Why did you hold back the first time?”

“You and I don’t have any grudges or enmity. I only use a sword of the same cultivation realm as you. You survived because of your ability.”

“My brother was also imprisoned in the Skywater Prison by the Si family.”

“My sister is there too. The stronger I am, the safer my sister will be.”

Seeing Qin Yu in doubt, Xi Menn continued to explain.

“If the monster race, the ghost race, and the demon race invade, they will need our strength.”

Qin Yu instantly understood. These people must have some means to control them.

Otherwise, once the alien race attacked wildly, who would want to die?

“Xi Menn, do you think you can cross over the gap between the fourth and fifth grade True Saint?”

“My sword is the Way of Rules. What about you?”

Xi Menn pondered for a long time.

“I think if we want to jump out of the Path of Heaven, we must have our own paths, just like Wu Ji. Otherwise, many cultivators in the world can’t enter the Tribulation Transcending Stage and even the emperor level.

“Your golden hand at the end was a little strange. It seemed to be formed by divine sense, and it seemed to have a power that surpassed this cultivation realm.”

“That is my divine sense power, compressed to the extreme with infinite force, undergoing a quantitative change to produce a qualitative transformation.”

Qin Yu did not hide anything.

“This requires the utmost determined willpower. It’s most essential that cultivators possess such unwavering willpower.”

Xi Menn praised Qin Yu after hearing his explanation, which was rather rare.

“You should find a self-defense weapon. Your current attacking power can be described as world-shattering. Even the geniuses I met in the Holy Region don’t have your destructive power. However, your self-defense is tremendously poor. If I were to split my mind and use the spirit bead to transform into hidden weapons to attack you, I’m afraid you would be in great danger.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Just like previously when three people came to challenge Xi Menn, Ying Zi approached his body in his attack.

It would be very dangerous if the dagger were to stab him.

“Yes, that’s true. However, I can’t split my mind. Once I use a sword, my entire soul will focus on it, and I can’t use other treasures.”

“The utmost offense is also defense. In fact, offense and defense are relative. Take my Suo Lin for example. The nine dragons’ attack is both an offense and a defense. I know you’ve been comprehending sword intent in your divine sense. Can you use the sword intent to temper your body and expand your meridians?”

Xi Menn’s eyes lit up as if he had found a direction.

Qin Yu had now transformed into a spirit bead. His divine sense was incomparably sharp, and he could remember every detail in battle.

His suggestion to Xi Menn was also made after he continuously deduced in the divine sense.

“Thank you.

“Your divine sense is so terrifying. If the spiritual energy in your body can keep up, I’m afraid even a half-step Reversion Void Stage cultivator can’t do anything to you.”

Xi Menn also gave his suggestions.

The two sat on the ground and looked up at the sky, chatting like old friends.

They casually chatted about the path of cultivation. Both of them were incomparably determined and talented people.

After a night of chatting, they actually gained something.

“Qin Yu, where did you go? I brought you a thigh. You don’t know how delicious it is!”

Jue Wu shouted from the peak of the mountain. In her hand was a piece of roasted black thigh meat.

“F*ck, I’ll go back first.”

Qin Yu bid goodbye to Xi Menn and returned to his mountain peak.

Wang Feng and Yun Qingyun were injured, but their internal qis were strong. They had broken through in a short time.

Wang Feng had reached the second grade, and Yun Qingyun the fourth grade True Saint.
