Entering the Divine Alchemist Pavilion had always been Taozi’s dream.

The token that had once been incomparably sacred in her heart had been shattered just like that.

Qin Yu, feeling a little uncomfortable, watched from the side.

“It has nothing to do with the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. It’s my own problem.” Qin Yu sighed and said.

Taozi snorted and said, “I will never return to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion in the future.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything else. He could only sit at the side and sigh silently.

Qin Yu pondered over it. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

If he wanted to defeat Han Wei, he had to at least step into the peak of the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm. Otherwise, Qin Yu’s chances of victory weren’t high.

And if he wanted to step into the peak of the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm, he would need at least a hundred Inner Strength Grandmasters to send themselves to their deaths.

“If I can devour a hundred Inner Strength Grandmasters, how great would that be?” Qin Yu thought inside.

However, it was unrealistic to have a hundred Inner Strength Grandmasters at the peak. Qin Yu didn’t have much hope for it.

Seeing that September 9th was getting closer and closer, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little anxious.

...

Jingdu, Yan family.

Li Zinan was kneeling in front of Yan Sihai as he said respectfully, “Mr. Yan, Qin Yu has already been chased out of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

Yan Sihai frowned and said in a deep voice, “It seems that Qin Yu is really seriously injured.”

Li Zinan hurriedly said, “President Yan, I saw with my own eyes Qin Yu seriously injured by the killing formation that I arranged. It can’t be mistaken!”

Yan Sihai glanced at Li Zinan, stood up and said, “Tell me, what do you want?”

Li Zinan suppressed the excitement inside and said, “President Yan, my request isn’t high, as long as you let me become an Elder of the Saint Confucian Sect!”

“Elder?” Yan Sihai frowned slightly.

One had to know that the position of an Elder of the Saint Confucian Sect was very high and gave control over tens of thousands of people.

Li Zinan was quite ambitious.

“President Yan, don’t worry. As long as I sit in the position of an Elder of the Saint Confucian Sect, I will do my best to recruit talents from all over the world!” Li Zinan spoke with confidence.

Yan Sihai was silent for a moment, as if he was considering it again.

“Master.”

At this moment, the office door was suddenly pushed open.

Then, he saw Zhang Yin standing at the door, as if she had something to say.

Yan Sihai nodded slightly. Then, he looked at Li Zinan and waved his hand, “You can go out first.”

Li Zinan hurriedly asked, “Then about my matter...”

Yan Sihai’s expression instantly turned cold. He said coldly, “I told you to go out. Don’t you understand?”

Li Zinan didn’t dare to say anything and hurriedly walked out.

After he left, Yan Sihai glanced at Zhang Yin and said, “What is it? Tell me.”

A trace of viciousness flashed in Zhang Yin’s eyes.

She walked in front of Yan Sihai, then said, “That old fart Yan Yunheng actually hasn’t given up yet. During this period of time, he has been constantly making moves. I heard that he has formed a team in Sea City. In just a short month, the scale of the company is enough to affect the entire Sea City!”

“Old fart?” Yan Sihai’s expression turned cold. He raised his hand and slapped Zhang Yin’s face.

“Yan Yunheng is my father. How can you insult him?”

Zhang Yin covered her face and said with some fear, “I... I know I’m wrong.”

Yan Sihai snorted and said, “Remember, my father is already dead. I don’t know who that person is.”

Zhang Yin was a smart person. She immediately understood and hurriedly nodded. “You’re right. Then... do we need to do something to him?”

Yan Sihai lit a cigar and narrowed his eyes. “Back then, he was called Jingdu’s business elite. In a short three years, he went from having nothing to becoming Jingdu’s overlord.”

“This kind of ability cannot be ignored. The slightest carelessness could result in complete defeat.”

Yan Yunheng was Yan Sihai’s father after all. Yan Sihai knew about his father’s abilities very clearly.

Even though Yan Yunheng had nothing now, Yan Sihai still didn’t dare to underestimate his abilities.

“Master, should I call the Chamber of Commerce in Sea City?” Zhang Yin asked.

Yan Sihai shook his head and said, “With his abilities, as long as he is given the slightest chance, he can topple the entire industry.”

Zhang Yin was stunned and quickly said, “Then what do you mean to do?”

“You can go out first. I will handle it.” Yan Sihai waved his hand.

Zhang Yin quickly nodded and said, “Yes, Master.”

After Zhang Yin left, Yan Sihai immediately took out his phone and dialed Li Zinan’s number.

“Don’t you want to be an Elder of the Saint Confucian Sect? I will give you a chance now,” Yan Sihai said coldly.

Li Zinan was overjoyed and hurriedly said, “Go ahead.”

Yan Sihai said coldly, “Help me catch someone. I’ll have someone send the information to your phone.”

“President Yan, is it... is it Qin Yu?” Li Zinan asked tentatively.

Yan Sihai snorted coldly and said, “Qin Yu isn’t worth my trouble. Moreover, currently, Qin Yu is already a cripple.”

Compared to Yan Yunheng, Qin Yu didn’t seem to be worth mentioning.

After hanging up the phone, a trace of viciousness flashed across Yan Sihai’s face.

“Dad, I originally wanted to let you live on for a few more years. Since you won’t give it a rest, then don’t blame me for being ruthless,” Yan Sihai narrowed his eyes and whispered.

...

In the following period of time, Qin Yu absorbed spiritual energy while waiting for the assassins to come to his door.

Three days later, Qin Yu suddenly stood up and said coldly, “We can’t wait any longer.”

Chuzhou couldn’t satisfy Qin Yu’s resource needs for a long time.

Therefore, Qin Yu decided to take the initiative to attack.

There were so many treasures, and opportunities were endless.

Staying at home and waiting for the opportunity to come was a bit too stupid.

“Maybe Fang Yue will have some news.” Qin Yu suddenly thought of his “partner.”

Qin Yu didn’t know what Fang Yue’s current attitude was, but Fang Yue was a smart person, so Qin Yu trusted her judgment.

“Huh?”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly felt an internal qi approaching him.

“A sixth level Inner Strength Grandmaster? Could it be Xiaoru?” Qin Yu thought to himself.

“It seems that she really couldn’t hold it in any longer.”

Qin Yu’s lips curled into a cold smile.

Then, he stood up and walked out of the house. He turned around and went to the back of the mountain.

The back of the mountain was very large. Qin Yu stood there alone.

The internal qi was getting closer and closer, and soon, it arrived near Qin Yu’s internal qi!

He turned around and saw Xiaoru approaching him with a sinister look.

“It’s you.” Qin Yu wasn’t surprised.

Xiaoru narrowed her eyes and said through gritted teeth, “Qin Yu, I took a slap because of you. I’m going to cripple you, lock you in a cage, and let you live in humiliation for the rest of your life!”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Are you a psychopath?”

Xiaoru said angrily, “Stop talking nonsense! Hand over the Meridian Circulation Technique now!”

Qin Yu ignored her words and asked, “Why are you alone today? Where are the other two?”

Xiaoru sneered and said, “We agreed that we will kill you together tomorrow, but I don’t want to share your treasure with the others.”
