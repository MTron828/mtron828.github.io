Qin Yu lamented, “It’s a long story.”

Mr. Wu said in a sullen voice, “Why don’t we arrange for you to enter the war zone first? No matter how arrogant the Hong Yi Sect is, they won’t dare to cause trouble in the war zone.”

“That won’t be necessary,” Qin Yu said with a smile. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“According to the agreement, today is the day I will go to the war zone, right?” Qin Yu suddenly remembered.

Mr. Wu nodded and said, “That’s why I’m here. If it’s convenient, we’d better set off now.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “No problem.”

“Xiao Yu, we’re leaving.” Mr. Wu shouted in Xiao Yu’s direction.

Xiao Yu opened her mouth, as if she had something to say.

“Say what you want to say.” Qin Yu smiled and said.

Xiao Yu waved her hand and said, “Forget it. I’ve already promised you to listen to my father’s words. We’ll keep our word.”

“Tsk, you’re quite trustworthy,” Qin Yu teased.

“Of course! Otherwise, how would I be able to establish independence?” Xiao Yu snifled her little nose with a proud expression.

It had to be said that many adults couldn’t compare to Xiao Yu in this aspect.

The car sped all the way and arrived at the war zone.

Updates by

The security of the war zone was extremely strict. There were two armed soldiers standing at the door, and there was a sense of oppression.

After the car drove over, Mr. Wu showed his ID and the door slowly opened.

In the office, Commander Guo and Mr. Yu had been waiting for him for a long time.

When he saw Qin Yu, Mr. Yu ran over excitedly.

“Mr. Qin, your deeds have been spreading. My ears are getting calluses from hearing about them all the time,” Mr. Yu said respectfully.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Officer Yu, don’t tease me.”

“No, no, no.” Mr. Yu hurriedly shook his head.

“I really want to acknowledge you as my mentor!” Mr. Yu’s eyes were full of admiration.

“Okay, Qin Yu is here on official business today. Don’t mess around,” Commander Guo scolded from the side.

Mr. Yu stood to the side sheepishly.

“Mr. Guo, I’ll leave the matters here to you,” Mr. Wu said to Commander Guo.

Commander Guo nodded and said, “Officer Wu, please rest assured!”

It could be seen that Mr. Wu had indeed retired. He didn’t have any real power in his hands anymore

After Mr. Wu left, Commander Guo invited Qin Yu into the guest room and made a pot of good tea.

Mr. Yu was serving tea at the side while Commander Guo sighed and said, “Who could have imagined that you would develop so fast?”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “Commander Guo, please don’t tease me. Let’s get back to business.”

Commander Guo nodded his head and said in a serious tone, “Based on your request, we are planning to invite you to become a specially appointed coach for the battle zone of Chuzhou.”

“Specially appointed coach?” Qin Yu was a little surprised.

Commander Guo nodded his head and said, “Pyro holds a few competitions for the battle zones every year and this has always been Chuzhou’s weak spot. Besides Jiang Gu, there are barely any martial artists.”

“Jiang Gu is also a businessman. He is focused on his family’s assets and he has always ignored the invitations from the battle zones.”

“This is why the Chuzhou battle zone always ranks at the bottom.”

Qin Yu suddenly came to a realization.

He took a sip of his tea and asked, “Commander Guo, can you tell me the average strength of the martial artists?”

Commander Guo said with a wry smile, “The average strength of the martial artists has just reached the level of an Inner Strength Master Hands.”

Qin Yu said in surprise, “They’re that weak?”

Commander Guo rolled his eyes and said, “Do you really think that martial artists are as abundant as cabbages by the roadside?”

Qin Yu touched his chin. That seemed to be the case.

The reason Qin Yu felt that there were many martial artists was that he had embarked on this path and entered this community.

When Qin Yu was still an ordinary person, he had never met a single martial artist.

This was enough to show that martial artists were very scarce.

“Commander Guo, may I ask, which battle zone is the one with the best performance now?” Qin Yu asked.

“Of course, it’s the Jingdu Battle Zone!” Before Commander Guo could answer, Mr. Yu said.

Commander Guo nodded and said, “That’s right. After all, Ye Qing was in the Jingdu battle zone. Ye Qing left them a lot of body-tempering techniques long ago.”

“This has also caused the Jingdu battle zone to be far ahead of other regions’ battle zones.”

Qin Yu rubbed his chin.

In terms of cultivation techniques, Qin Yu really wasn’t afraid of anyone.

Even if it was those people from top aristocratic families in Jingdu, Qin Yu didn’t feel that they were stronger than him.

It was just that it wasn’t so easy to find a suitable person to train these soldiers.

“Qin Yu, don’t be too pressured,” Commander Guo said.

“The higher-ups don’t have high expectations for you. It’s enough as long as we aren’t the last one this year,” Commander Guo said bitterly.

Qin Yu asked, “Commander Guo, when is the competition?”

Commander Guo said in a low voice, “According to the time in previous years, it should be the end of the year.”

The end of the year...

Qin Yu calculated the time. There were still two months left.

It was enough.

There were countless spells left in his father’s inheritance. Any one of them was enough to let the martial artists make a breakthrough.

If it was really impossible, Qin Yu could still refine pills to forcefully increase the strength of the martial artists.

“How about this? In a month, I will come to conduct special training for the martial artists,” Qin Yu said.

“A month?” Commander Guo was obviously a little surprised.

He said tactfully, “Qin Yu, although the requirement isn’t high, if we can get a better result, it’ll naturally be better...”

Qin Yu stood up and said with a nonchalant smile, “I’ll let Chuzhou battle zone take the first place in this competition.”

“What? First place?!” Commander Guo suddenly stood up.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “That’s right, first place.”

Mr. Yu, who was at the side, said with a sheepish smile, “Mr. Qin, it’s not that I’m looking down on you. Although you’re strong now, you’re still far from being comparable to Ye Qing.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Indeed, in terms of strength, I can’t compare with Ye Qing.”

“But in terms of cultivation technique foundation... Ye Qing might not be my match,” Qin Yu said with a nonchalant smile.

Commander Guo and Xiao Yu suddenly looked at each other in disbelief.

Qin Yu didn’t explain to them. He stood up and said, “If we don’t get first place, Commander Guo, you can hold me accountable.”

Seeing that Qin Yu was so confident, Commander Guo didn’t say anything else.

“Qin Yu, if we really get first place, you’ll be the hero of the Chuzhou battle zone. We’ll definitely reward you!” Commander Guo said seriously.

“There is no need for the reward. Just treat it as a contribution to the country,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

Qin Yu didn’t stay in the Chuzhou battle zone any longer. He didn’t even go to the special forces to take a look before he left.

“Commander Guo, do you think what Mr. Qin said is true?” After Qin Yu left, Mr. Yu couldn’t help but ask.

Commander Guo said with a bitter smile, “It’s easy to be complacent when you are young. Qin Yu clearly doesn’t know what the name ‘Ye Qing’ means...”
