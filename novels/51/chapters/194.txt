Chapter 195: The Letter of Challenge Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Mr. Wu stood there in silence for a long time before he quickly followed behind.

Qin Yu’s return to Chuzhou wasn’t publicized.

The first thing he did when he returned was to head straight for the Wei family’s home.

The Wei family’s home was perhaps the family that had suffered the most. If Qin Yu didn’t come to visit, it would be indecent of him.

At the entrance of the Wei family’s home.

Qin Yu’s Audi RS9 had already been repaired and was placed at the entrance.

Looking at the car, Qin Yu felt anguish in his heart.

Although he understood that Wei Ming was only standing on his side because of benefits, not many people would have believed him at a time like that.

Qin Yu took a deep breath. He pushed open the door and was about to walk in when Wei Tao walked out.

The moment he saw Qin Yu, his eyes immediately burned with rage!

“Qin Yu, you bastard! It’s because of you that my son became a vegetable. You have to return my son’s life...” Wei Tao kept punching Qin Yu’s body.

Qin Yu, allowing Wei Tao’s fists to land on his body, didn’t move at all.

Perhaps Wei Tao was tired from beating Qin Yu, he sat on the ground and looked extremely tired.

Qin Yu sighed slightly. He bent down and patted Wei Tao’s shoulder gently.

“Mr. Wei, I will avenge Wei Ming and treat Wei Ming’s illness at the same time,” Qin Yu said sincerely.

Wei Tao glanced at Qin Yu coldly and sneered. “Revenge? If you dared to take revenge, why would you run away to another country?”

Qin Yu knew that it was useless to say anything more, so he turned around and walked into Wei Ming’s room.

Wei Ming laid on the bed without moving. If it wasn’t for the fact that he still had internal qi, he would probably be considered dead.

Qin Yu sat beside Wei Ming and said quietly, “Wei Ming, I will remember your kindness.”

He sat by the bed for a long time before leaving the Wei family’s home.

“Qin Yu, I will definitely tell Jiang Gu about your return,” Wei Tao said coldly.

Qin Yu stopped in his tracks.

With his back facing Wei Tao, he said in a sullen voice, “I won’t trouble you. I’ll tell him myself.”

After saying this, Qin Yu left the Wei family’s home.

Besides Wei Ming, Hong Wu, Wei Jiang, and even Mr. Yang were all retaliated against.

Among them, the one who suffered the most was Hong Wu.

Although the ruthless Jiang Gu didn’t kill Hong Wu, he crippled his cultivation base!

He turned from an experienced Inner Strength Past Master into a cripple!

When Qin Yu arrived at the Hong family’s home, Hong Wu was sitting at the door while looking like an old man in his twilight years.

His followers had left a long time ago and he was alone in the huge manor. He looked extremely lonely.

“Mr. Qin.” Hong Wu wasn’t too surprised when he saw Qin Yu.

Qin Yu said in a sullen voice, “Mr. Hong, you can beg Jiang Gu for mercy to avoid this.”

A bitter smile flashed across Hong Wu’s face.

“Jiang Gu said that he would rather kill a thousand wrongdoers than let one go. Do you think it’s useful to beg for mercy?” Hong Wu’s face was full of anguish.

“I did beg for mercy, but it only saved my life.”

“To me, losing my cultivation base is no different from dying.”

Hong Wu’s voice was trembling as he spoke, and even Qin Yu felt anguish.

“Hong Wu, I will bear all the responsibility for my mistakes,” Qin Yu said in a sullen voice.

Hong Wu shook his head and said with a wry smile, “It’s useless to say this. I’m alone now. What’s the point of you killing Jiang Gu?”

Hong Wu, in order to cultivate, had never married or had children.

It was no exaggeration to say that martial arts were everything to him.

Now that his cultivation had been crippled, he was indeed living a life worse than death.

Qin Yu raised his hand and placed it on Hong Wu’s lower abdomen.

“What are you doing?” Hong Wu frowned.

Qin Yu said in a sullen voice, “Hong Wu, this might be an opportunity for you.”

“Opportunity?” Anger appeared on Hong Wu’s face.

“When I found out that you were a pharmacist, I mistakenly thought that I had obtained an opportunity.”

“But in the end? The result was that I became a cripple!”

Hong Wu glared at Qin Yu, and the anger that had been burning for days finally exploded!

Qin Yu was silent for a moment before he slowly said, “There are more than one cultivation method. As long as your Dantian isn’t shattered, you might be able to break through to the grandmaster realm.”

Hong Wu was stunned, and his eyes were filled with confusion.

However, Qin Yu didn’t explain to him. Instead, he patted Hong Wu on the shoulder and said, “In three days, when I kill Jiang Gu, I will make it up to you.”

After saying this, Qin Yu left the Hong family.

Although the news of Qin Yu’s return didn’t spread widely, it still spread around Chuzhou.

Almost everyone knew about it. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Qin Yu actually came back!”

“It seems that he can’t hold on any longer. After all, the Jiang family is ruthless.”

“Hehe, his return this time is like sending himself to his death.”

Everyone discussed animatedly. The Jiang family also received the news.

“Sir, Qin Yu is back.” Mr. Zhong stood beside Jiang Gu and said in a sullen voice.

A fierce look flashed across Jiang Gu’s face!

“Qin Yu... you really dared to come back! I will tear you into pieces!” A murderous aura rose from Jiang Gu’s body, and the entire room’s atmosphere became cold and eerie.

“Mr. Zhong, set off immediately. I want to kill Qin Yu!” Jiang Gu said coldly.

At this moment, a disciple of the Jiang family suddenly ran in.

“Master, Qin Yu sent a letter!” The disciple said anxiously.

Jiang Gu hurriedly took the letter.

He opened it and saw four words on it: A letter of challenge.

The time and place were written on it.

Apart from that, there were also some harsh words.

“I will chop off your head for my friend.”

“See you at the Eastern Cemetery in three days.”

“I hope you can come to the appointment on time.”

Upon seeing the contents of the letter of challenge, Jiang Gu couldn’t contain his anger anymore!

“It’s been a long time since someone dared to speak to me like that!” Jiang Gu tore the letter of challenge into pieces!

“Qin Yu is really reckless.” Mr. Zhong couldn’t help but sigh.

Jiang Gu was an Inner Strength Grandmaster and was a truly top-notch existence. How could Qin Yu compare to him?

“Answer him. Tell him that in three days, I will go to the Eastern Cemetery to take revenge for my son,” Jiang Gu said coldly.

“Yes.” Mr. Zhong hurriedly nodded.

This matter quickly spread. The matter of Qin Yu taking the initiative to challenge Jiang Gu became a hot topic.

“Qin Yu is really audacious. He actually took the initiative to challenge Jiang Gu!”

“I heard that he specifically chose the cemetery. Could it be because it’s convenient to bury his body?”

“If this kid can really win, he will definitely achieve great things in the future!”

No one had expected that not only did Qin Yu not hide, but he even took the initiative to provoke Jiang Gu!

Yan Jiang, who was in charge of secretly observing, also sighed slightly.

“Qin Yu’s courage has really exceeded my imagination.” Yan Jiang took a puff of his cigarette and muttered in a low voice.

At this moment, his phone suddenly rang.

He picked up the phone and saw a text message.

The person who sent the text message was Yan Ruoxue.
