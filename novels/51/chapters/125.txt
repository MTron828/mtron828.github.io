Chapter 126: Inner Strength Past Master! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The scar-faced man was laughing maniacally at the side!

“Lu Shuming, this is the person you’ve taken in? How useless!” The scar-faced man sneered.

Lu Shuming was already panicking, but since things had already come to this, he had no other choice.

“There is no grudge between us. Back then, I spared your life!” Lu Shuming roared maniacally.

The man with the scarred face sneered. “Yes, I will remember your kindness, so I won’t let you die today, as long as you kneel down and beg me, then get out of South City. How about that?”

“Impossible, don’t even think about it!” Lu Shuming said through gritted teeth.

The man with the scarred face said coldly, “Then don’t blame me for being merciless. None of you can leave today!”

After saying this, The man with the scarred face slowly stood up.

Hearing this, the hangers-on under Lu Shuming immediately panicked.

They anxiously said, “Mr. Lu, beg him for mercy quickly!”

“Yeah, you can’t implicate us. We don’t want to die.”

“Lu Shuming, don’t be too selfish!”

Hearing their shouts, Lu Shuming became even more enraged.

He gritted his teeth and suddenly shouted, “Let me tell you, Mr. Qin is from the Yan family. If you dare to touch him, the Yan family won’t forgive you!”

“The Yan family?” The man with the scarred face frowned slightly.

He glanced at Qin Yu and then sneered. “You want to scare me? As if the people of the Yan family would have relations with someone like you?”

Lu Shuming roared, “Believe it or not, he is the true love of the Yan family’s eldest daughter!”

The man with the scarred face immediately became even more incredulous.

The eldest daughter of the Yan family would like someone like him? That was impossible.

Even though that was the case, the scarred face still didn’t want to take that risk.

He sized up Qin Yu and said, “You can go. What happened today has nothing to do with you.”

Lu Shuming’s expression changed. If that was the case, then Qin Yu would be useless this time.

He, afraid that Qin Yu would agree, looked at Qin Yu nervously.

The scene fell silent for a moment. All eyes were on Qin Yu.

“I’m sorry.” Finally, Qin Yu spoke up.

He stood up slowly and shook his head. “I promised to help Mr. Lu, so I can’t leave.”

“Mr. Qin!” Lu Shuming was so excited that he was about to cry.

He didn’t expect that the person who would defend him at the critical moment would be Qin Yu!

The man with the scarred face’s expression darkened, and he said coldly, “Kid, don’t be so shameless. Even if you are a member of the Yan family, I can kill you and flee abroad!”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Don’t worry, I have nothing to do with the Yan family.”

“Mr. Qin, you...” Lu Shuming was speechless. Why didn’t he bring out the Yan family at this time? Was he crazy?

“Qin Yu, is there something wrong with you?!”

“If you weren’t from the Yan family, why are you sitting here? Would we need you?”

The people at the side also cursed at Qin Yu.

The man with the scarred face asked with some amusement, “Really?”

Qin Yu sneered. “What do you think?”

“Hahaha, I knew it. How could the people of the Yan family have anything to do with Lu Shuming?!” The man with the scarred face was completely relieved.

He looked at Lu Shuming and sneered. “Do you have any last words? Hurry up and tell me.”

Lu Shuming was completely in despair. He originally wanted to rely on the Yan family to scare the man with the scarred face, but he didn’t expect Qin Yu to say this at the critical moment.

“I’m unlucky to have fallen into your hands.” Lu Shuming took a deep breath.

“If you want to make a move, just do it!” Lu Shuming pretended to be calm and said.

The man with the scarred face sneered and said, “Then I won’t show mercy!”

After saying that, the man with the scarred face rushed toward Lu Shuming.

“Mr. Lu, if you are willing to give me ten percent of Wu Hongchang’s shares, I can save your life.” At this moment, Qin Yu, who was at the side, spoke again.

“Save me?” Lu Shuming couldn’t help but shake his head.

“How will you have to save me? Do you think anyone still believes in your relationship with the Yan Family?”

Qin Yu said indifferently, “I don’t need to rely on the Yan family. I just need to beat him.”

Everyone felt stunned.

Beat the man with the scarred face? How was this possible?

Even Wu Hongchang wasn’t his match, let alone Qin Yu?

“Mr. Qin, you can go.” Lu Shuming waved his hand helplessly.

“Lu Shuming, this is your last chance. It’s up to you to believe it or not.” Qin Yu poured a glass of water and said indifferently.

Looking at Qin Yu’s calm appearance, Lu Shuming couldn’t help but feel a little conflicted.

“Arrogant brat, I’ll kill Lu Shuming first, then I’ll deal with you!” The man with the scarred face shouted coldly and reached out to grab Lu Shuming.

Lu Shuming gritted his teeth. At this critical moment, he suddenly shouted, “Mr. Qin, I promise you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the scarred-faced man’s hand arrived in front of Lu Shuming!

At such a close distance, even Qin Yu wouldn’t be able to arrive in time!

However, something shocking happened.

Qin Yu’s hand pinched the water bead and flicked it lightly.

“Bang!” The scarred-faced man’s hand was shaken away!

A trace of blood flowed down the scarred-faced ma’s hand!

Everyone was shocked by Qin Yu’s move!

What the f * ck... What kind of tactic was this? He used a drop of water to save Lu Shuming?

Lu Shuming was ecstatic. He shouted frantically, “Thank you, Mr. Qin, for saving me!”

Qin Yu stood up slowly. He glanced at Lu Shuming and said indifferently, “Don’t forget you owe me ten percent of the shares.”

“Of course, of course!” Lu Shuming nodded crazily. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Not far away, the scar-faced man wiped the blood off his hands. He narrowed his eyes and said, “Using Inner Strength to wrap the water droplets? Good move. I didn’t expect there to be such an expert in South City.”

Qin Yu shook his head and said with a smile, “You’re wrong. This isn’t Inner Strength at all.”

“Not Inner Strength? Then what is it?” The man with the scarred face frowned and asked.

“I don’t want to tell you.” Qin Yu grinned and said.

The man with the scarred face’s expression darkened. He snorted coldly and said, “It’s impossible for you to beat me with this tactic! I will let you see my true strength!”

After saying that, The man with the scarred face activated his internal qi and raised it to the maximum!

A terrifying aura instantly swept across the entire area!

An intense pressure caused everyone’s expressions to change!

Even the cup on the table was instantly shattered!

“Inner Strength Past Master! He’s actually an Inner Strength Past Master!” Someone exclaimed loudly!

“Those below the level of Inner Strength Past Master are all ants, this... This is simply otherworldly!”

After they saw the strength of the scarred-faced man, everyone’s newly risen hope was instantly extinguished once again!

“You’re actually an Inner Strength Past Master...” Lu Shuming felt even more despair!

The number of Inner Strength Past Masters in the entire South City was extremely few. An Inner Strength Past Master would be able to make a name for himself wherever he went!

“To tell you the truth, I don’t lack money anymore. The main reason I came back this time is to take revenge!” The man with the scarred face said coldly.
