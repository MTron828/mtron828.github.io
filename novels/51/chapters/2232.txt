2233 The Other Qin Yu

Qin Yu’s pupils turned blood-red, and the way he looked at the man with the mustache became a little strange.

“F*ck, why are you looking at me!” The man with the mustache quickly covered his chest.

“D*mn it!”

Qin Yu had been trying hard to suppress his urge to devour the soul. The man with the mustache’s reaction made him almost vomit blood out of anger.

He grabbed four to five divine senses and swallowed them, but the aftereffects of the Soul Torment Mind Technique had not dissipated yet!

After consuming the Spirit Gathering Pill previously, he seldom used the Soul Torment Mind Technique.

But this time, after using the Soul Torment Mind Technique, that terrifying side effect surfaced again.

Qin Yu swallowed the soul that entered his divine sense one after another, and the crunching sound of biting an apple made the man of the mustache’s scalp tingle.

The demonic beasts’ souls let out intense screams but did not have the slightest ability to resist.

The terrifying screams scared Little Fatty and Xiaoru so much that they covered their ears tightly, not daring to listen.

“What kind of f*cking cultivation technique is this? Isn’t it too terrifying?”

“The divine sense’s devouring itself must be refined to the extreme without a trace of consciousness before it can be absorbed. Otherwise, the remaining willpower will definitely backslash in the future. However, Qin Yu’s cultivation technique seems to be able to devour the divine soul.”

This was the first time Elder Guai saw this, and his face was full of shock.

That feeling gradually subsided after Qin Yu devoured another seven or eight souls.

They were the demonic beasts of the True Saint Realm he had killed. Their souls had become incredibly powerful.

Under the devouring of the Soul Torment Mind Technique, these demonic beasts’ souls completely turned into pure spiritual soul power and fused into Qin Yu’s spiritual soul.

At this moment, his divine sense had fully recovered, and it had also become tremendous.

At this moment, Qin Yu could see every pebble and dust in the Sumeru ring.

As Qin Yu’s spiritual soul grew stronger, his divine sense seemed no longer limited to the divine sense figurine.

With a thought, the divine sense seemed to have melted slowly and turned into gas.

Golden divine sense energy mixed with black color spread into the Sumeru Space, and pressure suddenly spread out.

Feeling as if a terrifying beast was staring at him, the man with the mustache felt his hair stand on end.

“The Sea of Soul!”

Qin Yu suddenly grabbed the divine sense of the man with the mustache. It was a method used by one of the soul cultivators in Ta Shan’s team, but the scope was even bigger when Qin Yu used it now.

“F*ck, don’t drag me into your experiments!”

The man with the mustache’s soul was so frightened that it did not move at all. The suffocating feeling soon made his soul wither.

“Hmm?” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Qin Yu’s pupils suddenly changed. At this moment, he was extremely eager to devour the soul of the man with the mustache.

He restrained his soul with all his might, and blood even came out of the corner of his mouth.

A massive force seemed to strip him of his control over his body. In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu actually lost! In his sea of divine sense, he seemed to have seen another him looking at him coldly.

“The man with the mustache, quickly run!”

At the last moment, Qin Yu’s golden divine sense rolled up fiercely and bombarded the black divine sense like a tsunami. Taking advantage of this moment, the divine sense of the man with the mustache man quickly returned to his sea of consciousness.

Qin Yu’s divine sense returned to his body in the Sumeru ring.

At this moment, an enormous black phantom appeared behind Qin Yu.

The phantom had two giant long horns and held a trident with countless evil spirits carved on it. Its body seemed to be burning with flames.

“All of you must die!”

Qin Yu’s pupils turned black, and the eerie gaze looked very unsettling. A strange smile crept upon the corners of his lips.

A terrifying aura instantly enveloped the four people in the Sumeru ring.

“He’s not Qin Yu!”

Elder Guai’ was shocked.

Qin Yu’s hand trembled slightly, and the shadow behind him suddenly descended with the trident in its hand.

Countless tridents of evil souls fell, and ghostly wails and howls filled the entire Sumeru ring.

With a gentle beckoning of Qin Yu’s finger, the man with the mustache’s soul was instantly drawn out, unconsciously walking toward that phantom.

“Little Ginseng, you and Xiaoru do your best to inject the medicinal qi in your bodies into that phantom. You guys’ medicinal qi can condense soul and clear spirit. See if you can bring Qin Yu back.”

Elder Gual looked solemn.

Two streams of dense daffodil and ginseng medicinal qi hit Qin Yu’s body, and Qin Yu’s eyes regained a wave of clarity.

At this moment, the man with the mustache had already walked up to Qin Yu unconsciously.

In the next moment, Qin Yu might devour his soul directly.

Without hesitation after recovering a bit of his consciousness, Qin Yu used all of his golden divine sense and once again collided with the other half of his divine sense.

The man with the mustache finally came back to his senses. His divine sense returned to his sea of consciousness.

“F*ck, you’ll think I’m a cat if I don’t show off my power.”

The man with the mustache was furious. He could not help feeling a lingering fear when he thought about how his soul was nearly eaten up like an apple.

“Six Ghosts Formation!”

Six light beams suddenly shot out from Qin Yu’s side. The six light beams suddenly merged and then fiercely bombarded Qin Yu’s body.

“You guys don’t move!”

The man with the mustache roared at Elder Guai.

“Southern Ming Fiery Formation! Qin Yu, you brat, try my ancient fiery formation. It’s a good thing that restrains the soul!”

The man with the mustache shot out dozens of Saint Weapons, and countless green fireballs filled the space of the Sumeru ring.

Fireballs formed in the air and smashed into the massive shadow behind Qin Yu.

“Soul-burning fire! Little Ginseng and Xiaoru, protect your souls well! This fire was extremely harmful to the soul.”

Looking at the man with the mustache, Elder Guai was somewhat shocked.

This kid usually seemed to be out of tune, but his attainments in formation were indeed terrifying.

Phew!”

At this moment, Qin Yu took a deep breath, and the black phantom behind him suddenly blew out a gust of cold wind.

The fire froze into countless green ice cubes out of thin air and then smashed down.

The cold wind swept across the entire Sumeru Space, and the expressions of the man with the mustache, Elder Guai, Xiaoru, and Little Ginseng suddenly froze.

Their souls instantly froze after being swept by this gust of cold wind, and even their divine thought could not move at all.

“When I come out again, I won’t go back anymore, hehe!”

A golden light suddenly blasted out from Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness. That black Qin Yu left a terrifying sentence before retreating into the sea of consciousness.

Qin Yu’s forehead was covered in cold sweat. The golden and black figurines in his divine sense were now clearly distinguished. The pupils of his black divine sense slightly opened, revealing a meaningful smile.

With a thought of Qin Yu’s divine sense, he broke the frozen divine senses of the few people.

“What kind of cultivation technique are you cultivating? I’ve never seen such a strange cultivation technique all these years.”

The man with the mustache was shocked.

“It’s a heart technique from the netherworld. Previously, to repair my soul, I accidentally obtained this cultivation technique from someone. Now, the backlash seems to be getting increasingly serious.”

Qin Yu had a headache.
