Chapter 1358: Chapter 1,358, the hairpin of the masked woman 

Wen Da didn’t think too much about it. Besides, as a friend, he wanted to bring Qin Yu along.

As they were talking, Qin Yu walked over from not far away.

When she saw Li Yingying in front of her, Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Li Yingying, on the other hand, had the opposite attitude. She smiled and said, “Greetings, Brother Qin.”

Qin Yu nodded to her as a greeting.

“Qin Yu, hurry up and pack up. We’ll go shopping later!”Wen Da said excitedly.

Qin Yu glanced at Li Yingying and shook her head. “I’m not going.”

“Why? What are you doing at home alone?”Wen Da muttered.

“You two are going shopping. Why should I follow you? Let Wen Er stay with me,”Qin Yu said indifferently.

Her words showed her attitude and reminded Wen da.

Although Wen da was fun, he was not a fool.

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, he muttered, “That’s true. I Won’t bring you two third-wheel then.”

Li Yingying frowned slightly and was extremely displeased.

If it weren’t for Qin Yu, she wouldn’t have wanted to get close to Wen da at all.

“Brother Qin, Let’s go together. I happen to have a few questions to ask you,”Li Yingying said unwillingly.

Qin Yu said expressionlessly, “If you have any questions, you can ask them now.”

“Aiya, Qin Yu, let’s go out and have some fun together. Coincidentally, I didn’t bring you around Dayue City,”Wen da came up and said.

This kid wasn’t very thoughtful. He naturally didn’t know Li Yingying’s devious thoughts.

“Let’s go, let’s go. It just so happens that we can get to know each other,”Wen da urged.

Qin Yu sighed and had no choice but to nod in agreement. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Li Yingying was delighted, and an imperceptible smile appeared on the corner of her mouth.

Therefore, the three of them left the Wen family and prepared to go shopping.

As a top-notch city, dayue city was naturally not inferior to Gu City.

Although Dayue City did not have as many treasures as gu city, it was more inclusive.

People wearing all kinds of strange clothes could be seen on the street, and they could also see all kinds of strange toys and small jewelry. They could even see people selling underwear on the street.

“Yingying, if you have anything you like, just tell me. I will buy it for you!”Wen Da patted his chest and said.

However, Li Yingying’s mind was not on Wen Da at all. She laughed at Wen Da, and then her eyes fell on Qin Yu.

“Brother Qin, with your ability, if you recover your spiritual power, you will definitely become the number one genius of the South Province,”Li Yingying said, intentionally or unintentionally.

Qin Yu glanced at her and said, “I’m not interested in these false titles.”

“That’s true. Brother Qin, you don’t look like a person who is greedy for vanity,”Li Yingying said with a smile.

Qin Yu did not say anything. It was obvious that she did not want to talk to her.

Li Yingying continued, “I wonder what you plan to do in the future, Brother Qin?”

“I don’t know. I’ll take it one step at a time. I’ll live as long as I can.”Qin Yu deliberately showed a negative attitude in order to dispel Li Yingying’s thoughts.

“By the way, Wen Da, there’s a jewelry store over there. Why Don’t you two go over and try it out? Wen Er and I will go to the antique store over there.”Qin Yu Winked at Wen Da.

Wen Da immediately understood. He patted his chest as a gesture, then pulled li yingying and said, “Come, let’s go to the jewelry store to take a look.”

“I’m not a little girl. I’m not interested in jewelry. I also want to go to the antique store to look for gold.”Li Yingying rejected Wen da.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He looked at Wen er and said, “Wen er, have you heard the news that there’s a treasure left behind by an ancient powerhouse in the jewelry store?”

Wen Er did not understand this at all. He scratched his head and looked a little lost.

“Yes, I have heard of it too. It is said that there is a treasure left behind by an ancient female cultivator. For example, a hairpin beside that female cultivator in the tribulation stage. They are all top-notch treasures,”Li Yingying continued.

Qin Yu could not help but curse in his heart, “F * ck you! Can’t you tell that I don’t want to talk to you? !”

However, Li Yingying didn’t do anything excessive, so Qin Yu couldn’t be too cold.

“So where are you going?”Qin Yu directly brought up the topic.

Li Yingying was quite thick-skinned. She smiled faintly and said, “I’ll go wherever brother Qin goes. I just happen to learn from her.”

Qin Yu knew that Li Yingying was like a dog skin plaster that couldn’t be shaken off, so he didn’t say anything more.

He turned around and walked towards the jewelry store.

All the way to the jewelry store, Big Ben Wen began to carefully choose.

“Yingying, do you like this hairpin? I’ll give you that Rouge, right? That earring is too beautiful!”Wen Da said excitedly.

A trace of disgust flashed in Li Yingying’s eyes, but she did not show it.

“It’s said that there was a treasure that came from this jewelry shop,”Li Yingying said, intentionally or unintentionally.

Qin Yu nodded, obviously not wanting to pay attention to her.

Li Yingying continued, “Brother Qin, have you heard of a rumor?”

“What rumor?”Qin Yu asked casually.

Li Yingying said, “It’s said that in an ordinary jewelry shop in Zhongzhou, there was a top-notch treasure.”

“And then?”Qin Yu asked.

Li Yingying said in a deep voice, “It’s said that the treasure was a hairpin that the masked woman wore on her head.”

As soon as she said this, Qin Yu was instantly stunned on the spot.
