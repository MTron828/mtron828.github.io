“Thank you.”

Ju Wuwei cupped his fists with a solemn expression. To be able to obtain a sentence from Elder Tianji was something that many people in the lower realm dreamed of.

Qin Yu returned to the village in less than half a day. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He controlled Hua Qianje to hunt the demonic beasts nearby and then let the other four kill them.

In just half a day, their Saint power of the soul had become much more powerful.

Especially Shen Qian. Under Qin Yu’s special care, she had killed more demonic beasts than the others.

Although they were all from the three sects, Qin Yu naturally treated this silly girl who had gone through life and death with him better.

“Big Brother, can you tell me a story?”

Hong Yu ran over and hugged Qin Yu’s thigh as he asked eagerly.

“Of course.”

Qin Yu rubbed his little head and told him the story he had heard on Earth.

“Brother Qin Yu, the village chief says we will die soon. Grandpa will also die. However, he says he will create me when the time comes and make me shorter legs. Then he won’t have to run so hard to beat me.”

“Brother Qin Yu, the village chief says we will die soon. Grandpa will also die. However, he says he will create me when the time comes and make me shorter legs. Then he won’t have to run so hard to beat me.”

The little boy said curiously.

“Brother, can I see my sister and the others after I die? I asked the village chief, but he ignored me.”

Hong Yu seemed to have no idea about death. Instead, he had an expression of anticipation.

“Yeah, maybe.”

Qin Yu frowned. Why did the village chief say that? Now that the situation here was calm, the village would not be in danger of being destroyed. Moreover, with them here, these outsiders could not invade this place again, just like Ji Tianming.

“Brother Qin Yu, this Hua Qianje is really powerful. No demonic beasts here can defeat her. If we stay here for a while, no one will be our match.”

Shen Qian said excitedly.

“I understand now.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly. He finally understood what Immortal Emperor Yao had

Sd1U.

At this moment, on the horizon, a strange cloud of fire that was as bizarre as the sunset appeared in the sky that was dark originally.

The yellow light completely enveloped the entire area.

Moreover, the color of the sunset seemed to be deepening, like a flame burning in the air.

The next second, heaven and earth suddenly turned blurry, and a stormy wind started blowing.

“Boom!”

A scorching flame suddenly smashed onto the ground nearby. The massive force caused Shen Qian, beside Qin Yu, to look pale.

She spat a mouthful of blood. As the meteorite fell, a boundless energy storm swept over.

The massive wind almost covered the sky with yellow sand, and the entire forest burned with flames.

“Big Brother Qin Yu, what’s going on?”

A few of them were a little flustered, not knowing what had happened.

“This area is about to be destroyed because it no longer poses a threat to outsiders. It can only be destroyed. Otherwise, it will only become an area for outsiders to farm their Saint power.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said.

It was similar to some trigger points. The most powerful thing in this area should be at a specific boundary point.

It was just like that bear demon.

The moment the bear demon died, it meant the strongest creature here had been destroyed. If they wanted to stop the loss of Saint power, they must rebuild everything here. This was the self-consciousness of the Saint Kingdom.

“If that’s the case, won’t we always be in danger? They will immediately be reforged after the most formidable expert falls.”

Shen Qian thought of a very crucial point. After hearing it, the expressions of the others changed.

“That’s right. To this Saint kingdom, the appearance of you and the others will cause this heaven and earth to become uneasy. The entire Saint Kingdom will attack you until you all are extinguished.”

The village chief whistled and leaned against the door frame. He lightly touched his oily hair and threw a flirtatious glance at Shen Qian. He looked a bit like a rogue.

“It’s about time for all of you to leave. Otherwise, the destructive might of this heaven and earth will continue to intensify until it kills all of you.”

“Brother, you guys should leave quickly. Remember, you still owe me a kite.

You said you would make one for me!”

The little boy said loudly, the old man holding his hand with a sad expression.

“Village Chief, what about your village? Aren’t you leaving?”

Qin Yu frowned and asked.

“We can’t leave this place. This is the order we have to follow.” The village chief shook his head.

“Then what will happen to you all?”

“Our souls will be reconstructed. Perhaps we will be drifting in this place again and become demonic beasts or appear in other places.”

The village chief did not show emotions as if he had already expected this.

“After you’re reborn, will you guys still be you?”

Qin Yu hesitated for a moment and suddenly asked.

“Don’t waste precious time. Let’s go.”

“Brother Qin Yu, quickly go!”

The little boy shouted at him.

At this moment. the tremors became increasinclv exaggerated. Meteors keDt falling in this area.

“Boom!”

Hua Qianjie’s monster-like body slammed onto the gravel falling on them and smashed them away.

“Village chief, if there is no such order, I hope you can do your best to protect this little boy and his grandfather.”

Qin Yu hesitated for a long time before he cut Hua Qianje’s throat. Instantly, a tremendous powerful Saint power entered his body.

What appeared simultaneously was a “seed” that emitted a green light.

That was the power Revered Qi had given them. It was a power that could resist the order of the Saint Kingdom. Although there would be limitations, it might be able to help them.

He placed the seed of the Land of Disorder on the village chief’s body and left with the four people who were puzzled. “Leave this area as soon as possible.”

Qin Yu said with a frown.

He used a portion of the Saint power to strengthen his legs and distributed the other portion throughout his body.

A few of them escaped from this area using the fastest speed. Fortunately, they had obtained much Saint power of the soul in this short half a day, and their physical fitness had become even more powerful. Otherwise, they might not be able to leave this area.

However, as they ventured toward the edges of that region, the destructive storms of heaven and earth had considerably subsided.

“Boom!”

Qin Yu suddenly felt a sharp pain in his eyes. A massive white light suddenly descended from the sky.

Under the gaze of the true vision, Qin Yu saw the place enveloped by the white light a thousand meters away disappear into thin air.

It included the massive ancient tree 100 meters tall, all the living beings, and the village.

It turned into a bare flat ground as if this place had never had anything to do with it.

“What a strange method! This feeling is so unreal. If this white light hits us, won’t we be doomed?”

Li Yu, a disciple of the Heavenly Divination Sect, swallowed his saliva. This feeling was like rubbing an eraser on a piece of paper. Everything here disappeared, and they did not even feel any fluctuations..
