Li Zinan hurriedly waved his hand and said, “Mr. Yan, you misunderstood. I. . . I was also one of the participants that day!”

“Oh really?” Yan Sihai seemed to be interested.

He looked Li Zinan up and down and said, “You actually didn’t die. It seems that you have some ability.”

Li Zinan nodded desperately and said, “Mr. Yan, not only did I not die, but I also severely injured Qin Yu!”

“Severely injured?” Yan Sihai became more and more interested.

Li Zinan continued, “That day, I set up a formation and severely injured Qin Yu’s dantian! Now, he is already heavily injured, and his strength will slowly decline!”

“According to my rough estimation, currently, Qin Yu’s strength is only thirty percent of his peak strength!”

“In less than a month, his inner strength will completely disappear! At that time, he will become a cripple!”

After hearing Li Zinan’s words, Yan Sihai suddenly stood up!

He stared at Li Zinan and said coldly, “Is what you said true?”

“Absolutely true! I wouldn’t dare to lie to Mr. Yan!” Li Zinan hurriedly cupped his hands and said.

Yan Sihai frowned.

This news was too shocking, and he couldn’t help but doubt it.

“How can I believe what you said?” Yan Sihai asked coldly.

Updates by

Li Zinan hurriedly said, “Mr. Yan, if you don’t believe me, you just need to send someone to test it out!”

“Or rather, you can wait! I believe that it won’t be long before this news spreads!”

Yan Sihai thought for a moment, then muttered, “Alright, I’ll believe you for now, but I’m warning you. If you dare to lie to me, I guarantee that I’ll make you suffer a fate worse than death.”

Li Zinan bowed and said, “I don’t dare to.”

Then, Yan Sihai waved his hand, indicating that Li Zinan could leave.

However, Li Zinan stood there and didn’t leave for a long time.

Yan Sihai frowned and said somewhat unhappily, “What are you still standing here for?”

Li Zinan didn’t say a word, and with a plop, he knelt on the ground.

“Mr. Yan, I have yearned for the Yan family for many years. To be able to serve the Yan family is my lifelong dream. I beg you, Mr. Yan, to give me a chance!” Li Zinan knelt on both knees and knocked his head heavily on the ground.

Yan Sihai wasn’t a fool. Of course, he understood what Li Zinan meant.

This kid was obviously asking for credit.

“If what you said is true, I won’t mistreat you,” Yan Sihai stood up and said indifferently.

However, this answer didn’t satisfy Li Zinan.

Having been in society for so many years, Li Zinan didn’t believe in empty talk at all.

“Mr. Yan, I can’t wait to work for the Yan family,” Li Zinan said.

Yan Sihai said with a cold expression, “Then what do you want?”

Li Zinan quickly stood up from the ground and said, “I heard that the largest sect in the north, the Saint Confucian Sect, belongs to the Yan family! And the Saint Confucian Sect claims to have gathered all the Saint Confucians in the world. If possible, I want to contribute to the Saint Confucian Sect!”

Yan Sihai sneered. “Your ambition isn’t small.”

“Mr. Yan, you misunderstood. I just want to contribute my strength to the Yan family,” Li Zinan said respectfully.

“You know a lot,” Yan Sihai said coldly.

The Saint Confucian Sect was the largest sect in the north, and it had unparalleled martial power.

However, not many people knew that the Saint Confucian Sect actually belonged to the Yan family!

“Mr. Yan, don’t misunderstand. I was just too eager to join the Yan family, so I paid more attention to the news of the Yan family,” Li Zinan said with a bow.

Yan Sihai was silent for a moment, then said, “You can go. The Saint Confucian Sect will have a position for you.”

“Thank you, Mr. Yan!” Li Zinan was immediately overjoyed!

The Saint Confucian Sect was the largest sect in the north, and they had countless resources!

Furthermore, the Saint Confucian Sect had always been established as an orthodox sect. It had long been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Even the military district would select talents from among them!

Those who could join the Saint Confucian Sect were all geniuses in the world!

...

Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

In these three days, the news of Qin Yu killing more than a dozen Inner Strength Grandmasters continued to spread.

Finally, on the fourth day, news of Qin Yu’s dantian being damaged and his strength greatly reduced appeared on the Martial Arts Forum.

Unfortunately, this piece of news didn’t attract much attention.

The few comments were filled with doubt.

“Qin Yu’s dantian is damaged? That’s bullsh*t.”

“That’s right. You want to trick us into sending ourselves to death? Since his strength is weakened, why don’t you kill him to gain fame?”

“This baiting method has been overused.”

Looking at the comments on the Martial Arts Forum, Yao Qing couldn’t help but say excitedly, “Haha, these fools don’t believe it! Mr. Qin, as long as you restrain your internal qi, they definitely will not dare to attack you!”

Regarding this, Qin Yu didn’t say anything. No one knew what he was thinking. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

A few minutes later, Qin Yu suddenly said, “Oh right, is there a Martial Arts Village in Chuzhou? Or a city?”

Yao Qing scratched his head and said, “I don’t know. Why do you ask?”

Qin Yu didn’t answer. He took out his cell phone and called Jiang Gu.

After the call was connected, Qin Yu indicated his purpose.

Jiang Gu was silent for a moment and said, “Mr. Qin, it exists. It was set up by the Jiang Bei Martial Arts Association.”

“Chuzhou has always been the weakest area in the Jiang Bei region. Back then, in order to improve the martial arts strength of Chuzhou, the Martial Arts Association specially set up a Martial Arts Competition Village.”

“Where is it?” Qin Yu asked.

Jiang Gu said, “It’s in Flood Dragon Village, next to Bai City.”

“Okay, I got it.” Qin Yu hung up the phone.

Then, he looked at Yao Qing and said, “Come with me to the Flood Dragon Village in a few days.”

“Mr. Qin, what... What do you mean?” Yao Qing, puzzled, asked.

Qin Yu waved his hand and didn’t answer.

When Qin Yu and Li Zinan fought, Jing Lu watched the whole process.

Qin Yu killed Jing Lu’s father, so Jing Lu would never let it go.

Therefore, he believed that the news of his dantian being damaged would be spread.

As expected, over the next few days, news of Qin Yu’s dantian being injured and his strength being weakened kept appearing on the Martial Arts Forum.

As the saying went, a repeated rumor made others believe it.

One or two repetitions might not make people believe it, but as the number of posts increased, everyone began to have some doubts.

“Huh?” Qin Yu, who was lying on the bed, suddenly raised his eyebrows.

He clearly caught a few flashes of internal qi around him.

The corner of Qin Yu’s mouth curled up into a sneer.

“Finally, someone came to inquire about the news.” Qin Yu sat up from the bed with his legs crossed.

Then, his internal strength was pushed back, and he spat out a large mouthful of blood. His face also became somewhat pale.

“Mr. Qin, you... How are you?” Seeing this, Yao Qing hurriedly ran over.

Taozi walked forward quickly and said in a low voice, “Elder Qin, you have been vomiting blood more and more frequently these days. You... you’d better return to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion as soon as possible.”
