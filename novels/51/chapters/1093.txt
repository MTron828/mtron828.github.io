Chapter 1094: Chapter 1,094, headed to Cloud Dragon Island 

Out of the ten over elders, four or five had left.

Qin Yu did not say a word. He had already expected this outcome.

He swept his gaze over the crowd and said slowly: “No one has left, right? Alright, let’s go.”

With that, Qin Yu turned to look at Star picking.

Star picking grunted in gratitude before he took the lead and led the group towards Cloud Dragon Island.

The Cloud Dragon Island was not within the Yan country’s borders, but was located on an isolated island in the deep sea.

This place could be said to be truly desolate and uninhabited, with almost no one passing through here. Of course, this also caused the path to the Cloud Dragon Island to become somewhat difficult.

The group changed their various means of transportation and arrived at the shore.

Standing there, Qin Yu gazed at the boundless sea level, before he raised his finger and pointed in a certain direction.

“According to the location on the map, it should be in this direction,”said Qin Yu.

“Yes, but I’m afraid it will be a little difficult to go to Cloud Dragon Island,”said Zhai Xing.

“It’s okay. Leave it to me.”Zhuang Teng patted his chest.

He had a lot of connections, so it was indeed easier to find a ship.

Zhai Xing glanced at zhuang teng and said, “There are very few ships going to Cloud Dragon Island. Even if you have great connections, it’s useless.”

“Try it. If it really doesn’t work, we’ll think of another way,”Zhuang Teng said with a smile.

Zhuang Teng did not waste any time. He immediately began to use his connections to find a ship going to the Cloud Dragon Island.

Just as Zhai Xing said, there were very few ships going to the Cloud Dragon Island.

Zhuang Teng did not know how many calls he had made, but all of them were met with a nose full of dust.

About half an hour later, Zhuang Teng ran back eagerly.

“I have to say, our luck is really good,”Zhuang Teng said with a smile.

“Have you found it?”Qin Yu asked.

Zhuang Teng said with a smile, “It just so happens that there is a group of rich businessmen here who are planning to take a boat trip. One of them is passing by Cloud Dragon Island. I tried to persuade them, but they finally agreed to give us a ride.”

Qin Yu patted Zhuang Teng on the shoulder and said with a smile, “Well done.”

Zhuang Teng said with some pride, “Do you think that all the banquets I’ve held all these years have been for nothing? Our Zhuang family...”

At the mention of the Zhuang family, Zhuang Teng suddenly fell silent, and a trace of pain flashed across his face.

“You can’t reminisce about the past, don’t think about it,”Qin Yu comforted him.

Zhuang Teng forced a smile and said, “Yes, I’m fine.”

About four to five hours later, a ship arrived nearby.

It was a cruise ship with many wealthy businessmen dressed in luxurious clothes.

Zhuang Teng quickly went forward to negotiate. A few minutes later, Zhuang Teng waved his hand and said, “Everyone, get on the ship.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

A group of people got on the ship. Although they were all famous aristocratic families in Jingdu, they were not welcomed on this ship at all.

The local businessmen looked at Qin Yu and the others with disdain.

“I heard from Zhuang Teng that what kind of martial artists are you? Can You Fly?”A young man in a suit walked forward and said indifferently.

Seeing this, zhuang teng hurriedly introduced, “This is Gong Tianyu, the organizer of this parade.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said politely, “Thank you for your help.”

Gong Tianyu ignored this and said with a faint smile, “You guys are so powerful, why do you still need to take a boat? Can’t you just fly over?”

“Oh my God, YOU MOTHERF * cker...”Chang Mang was displeased. He was about to curse when he was stopped by Qin Yu.

“Mr. Gong, you must be joking. Flying in the sky and flying in the Earth are out of our reach,”Qin Yu said politely.

After all, they were riding on someone else’s boat, so it was not good for them to shed all pretenses.

Gong tianyu snorted and said, “I really don’t know what you guys are bragging about every day. No matter how powerful you are, are you still as powerful as a spear?”

“That’s right. What era is it now? Why are you still practicing martial arts? It’s more like practicing dancing.”The other wealthy merchants also laughed, obviously treating Qin Yu and the others as laughing stock.

Qin Yu’s people couldn’t hold it in any longer. Just as they were about to flare up, they were interrupted by a wave of a hand.

“Forget it, there’s no need.”Qin Yu shook his head.

Gong Tianyu waved his hand, and immediately, a bodyguard walked over.

“My bodyguard was hired from abroad at a high price. Do you want to Spar with him?”Gong Tianyu said proudly.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “There’s no need.”

Gong Tianyu became even more proud when he heard that.

From his point of view, Qin Yu was obviously afraid.

“Take them to the basement. There’s no other place. You Won’t mind, right?”Gong Tianyu said with a smile.

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

There were not many people on the ship. It was obviously a lie to say that there was no place to live.

However, Qin Yu was too lazy to argue with him. As long as they could reach Cloud Dragon Island, it was enough.

Therefore, under the lead of the bodyguards, the group arrived at the basement.

“Damn it, Zhuang Teng, what the Hell did you find? Your words are disgusting, and you even let us live in such a place! If it weren’t for Qin Yu stopping us, I would have smashed his head into pieces!”Chang Mang scolded.

Zhuang Teng said with slight embarrassment, “Gong Tianyu has always been like this. He has been spoiled by his parents. He is not afraid of anything. He always thinks that he has seen through the truth of the world. Otherwise, he would not have organized this sea parade.”

“That’s right. Usually, there are no ships heading to the vicinity of Cloud Dragon Island.”Zhai Xing nodded.

Zhuang teng spread his hands and said with a bitter smile, “Young Master Gong doesn’t believe in evil.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “It doesn’t matter. We already owe him a favor, so there’s no need to be calculative.”

“Moreover, there will be times for him to beg us along the way.”

With that, Qin Yu and the others divided their rooms.

According to the captain’s calculation, even if the ship sailed the fastest, it would still take about five days to arrive at Cloud Dragon Island.

Qin Yu was not in a hurry. He just happened to use these five days to absorb the power of divine sense in the jar.

Therefore, after Qin Yu, Jiang He, and the others gave some advice, they returned to their own room and took out the jar of divine sense.

The moment the jar was opened, white gas was emitted.

“It will take about three days to completely absorb it,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Previously, the mustache, Tie Dan, and the others had told Qin Yu that once the chaotic body entered the martial saint stage, each minor realm would bring about a huge increase in strength.

If he advanced to the middle stage of the martial saint stage, it was not impossible for him to fight against a mighty figure.

‘hopefully, the remaining half of the jar can help me advance to the middle stage of the Martial Saint Stage,’Qin Yu thought to himself.

He closed his eyes slightly and sat cross-legged in his mind with his primordial spirit. He began to absorb the divine sense power in the jar.

Traces of power slowly entered Qin Yu’s body and slowly fused with his primordial spirit.
