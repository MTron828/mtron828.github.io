2393 The Final Trial

At this moment, regardless of his naked eye, divine sense, or desolate divine eye, the immortal grave in front of him suddenly vanished, leaving nothing behind.

It was the clear will that was transmitted from the will, making Qin Yu not dare to move at all.

In an instant, numerous thoughts flashed through Qin Yu’s mind. If the immortal grave was here to test people, there should not be such a terrifying killing intent.

Immortal Emperor Lei had left this immortal grave for an unknown period of time. His fundamental consciousness had long dissipated. What was left was his instinctive action. In other words, this killing intent was not fake at all.

With a step forward, he could face a terrifying blow.

Outside the immortal grave, the entire sky above the Thunder Courtyard spun like a vortex.

Countless thunderbolts flashed in the dark clouds. With Thunder Courtyard as the center, more thunderclouds were uncontrollably approaching the vortex. The vigorous momentum attracted innumerable onlookers.

“Is someone in Thunder Courtyard about to break through?”

“Only the Tribulation Transcending Stage has such a powerful force.”

“Could it be that Thunder Courtyard and the nine great aristocratic families have started a war? It’s normal to have such a force if Lei Xin of Thunder Courtyard goes all out.”

Countless people were discussing animatedly.

Numerous terrifying internal qi gathered in the hall. Yan Guyun, Si Liuhe, and almost all the most powerful forces from both families had arrived.

“Lei Xin, what do you mean by this?”

Yan Guyun asked in an unfriendly tone.

“Nothing much. I will naturally do what I promised you. My disciple is comprehending in the immortal grave now. Do I have to ask you for permission?”

Lei Xin’s face was cold, and he did not show them respect at all.

He and Flower Granny looked at each other and saw a trace of worry in each other’s eyes.

“Dean Lei, to prevent us from comprehending the secret of Immortal Emperor Lei, you activated the final trial of the immortal grave. Do you think Qin Yu can accept the inheritance of Immortal Emperor Lei? Who here dares to say that they can take on this final trial? I want to see Dean Lei’s embarrassment in the end.”

S Liuhe shook his head, sneered, and said.

Everyone was watching the scene in the immortal grave. Many people from the Yan family and Si family were also curious.

Lei Xin had wanted to give Qin Yu more time, and he did not expect the two families to arrive so soon.

After much hesitation, he finally activated the final trial.

That was a method used by the family when they were on the verge of death. As long as they could pass the test of the Immortal Emperor’s will, they could obtain all the inheritances. After that, the mystic realm would be completely destroyed, leaving nothing for the enemy.

Almost every family had this method, but very few people would use it now.

First of all, it was only used when one was in a desperate situation. It meant one could no longer comprehend the dao technique left behind by the Immortal Emperor in the future. Second, one had to have great confidence in the person on trial.

Ordinary people probably could not even stand when facing the will of the Immortal Emperor, not to mention receiving an attack.

Lei Xin had a complicated expression on his face. This was something his ancestor had left him.

He was also extremely reluctant to use his last resort.

However, he made this decision after seeing Qin Yu’s performance before coming to the immortal grave.

Someone who could endure such intense pain from the fierce thunder might be able to withstand the final trial.

Flower Granny’s expression was also hideous. Till now, she had not heard of anyone who could survive the final trial in the mystic realm of the Immortal Emperor.

The Immortal Emperor’s will would unleash a powerful attack without mercy, even if Lei Xin went personally.

It was either inheriting or destroying it.

In the past, the Jee family had an exceptionally talented person. He could even use the power of a True Saint to resist the Tribulation Second Level Soul Statue cultivator. In the end, he could not pass the test of the Jee family’s ancestor, and the entire mystic realm inheritance self-destructed straightaway.

That immortal grave had turned into a sea of thunder now.

In the endless lightning, a body formed by countless violent lightning slowly condensed and formed.

He looked at Qin Yu indifferently, waiting for his choice. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

In the span of a few breaths, Qin Yu felt that his soul was exhausted, and he wanted to vomit.

It was a life-and-death choice. Even if it was just a wisp of internal qi, Qin Yu felt that it was not something he could defeat.

The gap between him and Immortal Emperor Lei was too big. Moreover, he had just gathered with Ruoxue. Did he really want to take this step?

The scene of Yan Tianshi taking Yan Ruoxue away kept reappearing, and that sense of powerlessness was still there.

Dean Lei and Flower Granny had given him a chance. Did he want to retreat now? Impossible!

Qin Yu’s eye expression suddenly became determined. He took a step forward.

“Boom!”

Every cell in his head was emitting pitch-black demonic qi. He looked like a demon god that had descended.

“Boom!”

Qin Yu let out a miserable cry. That violent internal qi was like a torrential sea that rampaged through his body. Qin Yu gritted his teeth and controlled the vigorous power to punch at the figure transformed from thunder.

This violent punch split the sea of thunder into two, and the entire immortal grave trembled terribly.

Countless thunderbolts and demonic qi emanated from the immortal grave.

“What a terrifying physical strength! This punch is close to the Tribulation Second Level Soul Statue. However, this attack has caused self-damage to his body. Can he still endure the test of Immortal Emperor Lei? He might have a chance if he uses this power to defend.”

Si Liuhe shook his head. He was naturally a man of high standards and saw the key point.

“No, he can’t even defend it. Even Jee Tian, the genius of the Jee family who could fight against a Tribulation Second Level Soul Stature cultivator, also failed to take the final trial.”

Even Yan Guyun felt that it was a pity for Qin Yu.

The body of Immortal Emperor Lei…

Immortal Emperor Lei transformed into a bolt of lightning flying into the sky and stood floating.

Countless powers of thunder gathered toward him. With a thought from his divine sense, the thunder and lightning transformed into all things.

In the second breath, he stretched out his hand, and Sea of Soul suddenly appeared in the immortal grave.

The familiar internal qi made Qin Yu feel suffocated. It seemed to be the sea of thunder of the Path of Heaven that unleashed from the power of thunder!

Singularity Space!

Qin Yu swung his palm out.

In front of his palm, ten thousand layers of space suddenly blocked in front of his eyes, and only then did Qin Yu feel a little relieved from the pressure.

His eyes were full of shock. Was this the terrifying energy of the Immortal Emperor? He actually used his body’s strength to unleash the power of the Path of Heaven!

Qin Yu’s body trembled uncontrollably. Like an ordinary person facing a mountain and an ocean, he had a natural sense of fear.

A massive statue slowly formed and submerged into the sea of the Path of Heaven. An even more violent force exploded on the Immortal Emperor’s body.
