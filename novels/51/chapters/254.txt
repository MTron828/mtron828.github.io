Chapter 255: The Unruly Xiao Yu Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Since Mr. Wu had agreed to all his requests, Qin Yu couldn’t refuse any further, so he could only agree to it for the time being.

“I’ll set off for the provincial capital tomorrow,” Qin Yu said.

Mr. Wu hurriedly nodded and said, “Okay, I’ll wait for you in the provincial capital.”

Then, Mr. Wu left Bai City with Xiao Yu.

After returning to his room, Qin Yu looked at the Divine Medicine in his hand and fell into deep thought.

The effects of this Divine Medicine were absolutely beyond imagination.

Moreover, Divine Medicines were hard to come by, so Qin Yu definitely couldn’t waste its effects.

“What pill should I refine...” Qin Yu stared at this Divine Medicine and muttered softly.

Of course, even if this Divine Medicine was swallowed, it would have unimaginable effects.

But if it was refined into a pill, the effects would be even greater.

Yao Qing swallowing all the herbs was simply a reckless waste of a god’s gift.

“It’s time to try and break through.” Qin Yu temporarily put away this Divine Medicine.

After experiencing this battle, Qin Yu felt the critical point of breaking through.

Therefore, he immediately closed his eyes and started breathing exercises while feeling the spiritual energy and dark energy in his body.

Traces of internal qi flowed through Qin Yu’s meridians and into his entire body.

Under Qin Yu’s guidance, his internal qi began to slowly increase and attack all the acupoints in his body.

Qin Yu didn’t open his eyes for an entire night.

It wasn’t until the next morning that Qin Yu sat down on the ground.

This time, his physical body had actually improved again!

Although it wasn’t as exaggerated as before, it was enough to show that the strength of the physical body brought by the improvement of the Nine Transformation Golden Pill and the advancement in level didn’t conflict!

Qin Yu clenched his fist and muttered in a low voice, “The consumption of spiritual energy this time is dozens of times more than before...”

It could even be said that the consumption of spiritual energy from the Qi Refining Stage to the sixth level of the Foundation Establishment Stage wasn’t as much as the consumption of this small leap in level!

“It seems that in the future, cultivation will become more and more difficult...” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

After a quick shower, Qin Yu and Yao Qing rushed to the provincial capital.

...

In Jingdu, the Han family’s home.

A man who looked like a butler walked into the study.

A young man was sitting in the study while holding a book in his hand and flipping through it.

This young man was none other than the oldest son of the Han family, Han Wei!

“Didn’t I tell you not to disturb me when I’m reading?” A hint of displeasure flashed across Han Wei’s face.

The butler quickly bowed and said, “Young Master, there’s something important that I think I should tell you as soon as possible...”

“Something important?” Han Wei raised his eyebrows.

He closed the book in his hand and asked casually, “What is it?”

The butler quickly said, “Han Yilong... was killed...”

“This piece of trash deserved to be killed.” Han Wei snorted lightly. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“All these years, he has been bluffing and cheating in the name of the Han family, but in the end, he is still an Inner Strength Master Hands!”

“This kind of trash is simply a disgrace to the Han family!”

It was obvious that Han Wei didn’t care about Han Yilong at all, and he even felt a little disgusted.

The butler was silent for a moment before he said tentatively, “Young Master, the person who killed Han Yilong... has a special identity.”

“Oh really?” Han Wei raised his eyebrows.

He sneered. “Could it be the Young Master of some aristocratic family?”

The butler shook his head and said with a bitter smile, “It’s... It’s Qin Yu.”

“Qin Yu?!” When he heard this, Han Wei’s expression immediately turned cold.

“Qin Yu... actually dares to provoke the Han family?” Han Wei looked at the butler coldly.

The butler said with a bitter smile, “Qin Yu doesn’t even feel afraid of you, let alone Han Yilong...”

Han Wei, not saying a word for a while, put his hands behind his back and looked out of the window.

“Trash killing trash? How interesting.” Han Wei touched his chin and said.

The butler said with a bitter smile, “Young Master, although Han Yilong is incompetent, he is still a member of our family...”

“If we don’t do anything, the Han family’s prestige will definitely be damaged. At that time... the consequences will be unimaginable...”

Han Wei didn’t speak for a while, as if he felt that the butler’s words made sense.

“How about... finding someone to teach him a lesson? Or directly...” the butler made a gesture of cutting his throat.

Han Wei shook his head and sneered. “No rush, no rush.”

“If I kill Qin Yu now, Yan Ruoxue won’t let me off the hook.”

The butler frowned and asked, “Then what should we do?”

Han Wei sneered. “Can’t we just kill everyone who witnessed it?”

The butler quickly cupped his hands and said, “Young Master, I understand!”

After saying that, he turned around and walked out.

Han Wei looked out of the window, squinted his eyes and said, “Interesting, interesting... Qin Yu, I will personally kill you in front of Yan Ruoxue!”

...

Qin Yu rushed all the way to Mr. Wu’s house.

Food had already been prepared at home to welcome Qin Yu.

As soon as he entered the house, he saw Xiao Yu sitting on the sofa while throwing a tantrum.

Meanwhile, Mr. Wu comforted her with a helpless look on his face.

“If you don’t think of a way for me, I will fast, and I won’t eat!” Xiao Yu said angrily.

Mr. Wu said with a frown, “Do you think your father is omnipotent? I really can’t help you with this kind of thing...”

“What’s going on?” Qin Yu asked in surprise.

Mr. Wu forced a smile and said, “Xiao Yu insisted that I help her find some connections to get tickets for some celebrity’s concert.”

“I’m a chief, so how can I help her do this kind of thing?”

Xiao Yu widened her eyes and said, “You just don’t want to help me! With your status, it’s easy to ask someone for a few tickets!”

“Anyway, if you don’t help me, I’ll go on a hunger strike!” Xiao Yu said with determination.

Qin Yu asked in surprise, “What tickets?”

Xiao Yu glanced at Qin Yu and said, “The tickets for Yang Jing’s concert! She’s very popular now. I was waiting all night last night, but the tickets sold out in less than a minute.”

“Yang Jing?” Qin Yu touched his chin.

He didn’t expect Yang Jing to be so popular. Even Xiao Yu was her fan.

“What’s the point of obsessing over these celebrities? Aren’t they just a bunch of entertainers?” Mr. Wu muttered at the side.

When she heard this, Xiao Yu became even angrier.

“What do you know?! It’s bad enough that you won’t help me, but you’re even slandering my idol! I want to run away from home!” Xiao Yu stood up angrily and turned around to leave.

Mr. Wu, unable to do anything, stood by the side. He could only coax her.

“I can help you get a ticket,” at this moment, Qin Yu suddenly said.

Xiao Yu’s eyes lit up, and she said excitedly, “Really?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Of course, but I have a condition.”

Xiao Yu quickly said, “What condition? Hurry up and say it. I’ll agree to it even if I have to work as a slave!”

“Really?” Qin Yu smirked.
