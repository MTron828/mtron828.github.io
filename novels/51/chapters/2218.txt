2219 The Memory of Father

Within the vast memory, Qin Yu searched for records about Satan.

Suddenly, Qin Yu discovered a cultivation technique manual.

The Soul Torment Mind Technique?

Qin Yu quickly browsed through this cultivation method. How this technique worked seemed fundamentally similar to the previous netherworld cultivation technique.

However, compared to the cultivation method given to him before, it was even more obscure and complicated. An image suddenly appeared in Qin Yu’s divine sense.

A golden figure threw out punch after punch in the black space.

He kept moving forward. After the black space was torn apart, it revealed the black and white mountains and rivers.

It seemed to be a space different from the one humans lived. Black water flowed, and figures floated in the air could be seen everywhere.

In just an instant, the space the fist had torn apart returned to black.

Was this the Satan? It was as if his father’s divine sense was forcefully entering Satan.

“No one can stop the person I want to take away.”

The voice was very soft but sounded like a large bell in Qin Yu’s ears. “This’s my father,” thought Qin Yu.

The golden light on the fist shone brightly, and the black space could no longer stop the golden figure.

The world of Satan suddenly appeared, and a woman wearing a mask appeared before the golden figure.

The masked woman?

Qin Yu was shocked. His father had actually interacted with the masked woman.

A fist against a palm.

His divine sense became blank as if it could not bear the battle situation reflected by the two people’s attacks.

Satan was a place where divine souls gathered. It was a space created by the five great soul-cultivating emperors.

After a person’s death, unless their spirits completely dissipated, they would be drawn into this space.

A conspiracy seemed to be brewing here.

“This cultivation method was obtained from the masked woman. Its cultivation technique is inextricably linked to the dao technique rules of Satan. I didn’t cultivate it.”

A snippet of his father’s words came to Qin Yu’s mind. After that, there was no other information. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

His mind was in a mess. Previously, his divine sense was damaged, and he had no choice but to cultivate Satan’s secret technique that Sister Ning had given him.

However, looking at the information left behind by his father, this cultivation technique seemed to have tied him to the dao technique of Satan. Moreover, even his father had not tried it. This cultivation technique seemed to have a killing intent that was difficult to detect.

At the Si family in the Holy Region.

“So many people from the nine great aristocratic families have been exiled to purgatory, yet they still haven’t killed Qin Yu?” Yao Xi frowned and said.

“Yao Xi, as the Holy Son of the Yao family, are you so afraid of Qin Yu?”

Si Shiyue said with a cold smile. The internal qi on him was strong. He had reached the True Saint Realm.

“This kid’s improvement speed is far beyond our imagination. “Don’t forget the grudge between your Si family and him is even deeper. If he comes back, your Si family will be the first to suffer.”

Yao Xi sneered and said.

“Do you know why purgatory became a place of exile?”

Si Liuhe laughed lightly and said.

“The Purgatory has existed for hundreds of thousands of years, and the most powerful cultivators are only at the True Saint Realm. There hasn’t been a cultivator at the peak of the Tribulation Transcending Stage, let alone an Immortal Emperor. Do you know why?”

Yao Xi shook his head. He had never heard of the secrets of purgatory.

“The dao technique in this place has withered, and the spiritual energy has dried up. They can only obtain resources by fighting and plundering. And those who have reached the True Saint Realm rarely can comprehend the way. Moreover, even those who have reached the fifth-grade realm can only comprehend the imperfect way, which is far inferior to the ways of the Great Dao in our resourceful Holy Region.”

Si Liuhe said with a smile.

“Let’s not talk about whether he can come back or not. Even if he can, he can’t withstand a single blow from a fifth-grade True Saint of the Holy Region. You’re overthinking. Once you break through to the True Saint Realm, with the resources of the Yao family, you can reach the fourth grade soon. At that time, you find a Mystic Realm with plentiful the way and break through to the fifth-grade realm. That’s the important matter.”

The head of the Si family, Si Wujue said.

“I heard your Yao family has a new genius who is already a half-step True Saint named Yao Meng. I heard that she has only cultivated for a few decades. If this continues, your Yao family’s Holy Son might have to be replaced.”

Si Shiyue said coldly.

If Qin Yu heard this, he would be tremendously shocked. After Yao Meng solved her cultivation problem, her progress was so terrifying. The most talented person on Earth had returned.

Yao Xi had come frequently to urge the Si family to use the people from the Skywater Prison, which gave them a headache.

After Yao Xi left, Si Wujue looked at Si Liuhe.

“What do you think?”

“It’s fine. Qin Yu is indeed a genius. He can actually comprehend the way on the land where the dao technique has withered. However, it’s only the way that is incomplete. Moreover, his advancement will only become increasingly slower. I have already broken through to the fifth grade in the Si family’s Mystic Realm. My subsequent speed will only be faster. He’s an ant before me.”

Si Liuhe laughed lightly.

Why did the Holy Region become the Holy Land for Cultivation, and dozens of Immortal Emperors even emerge?

Once the dao technique descended, many cultivators immediately broke through.

“Just issue the arrest warrant. There’s no need to pay attention to Qin Yu. Shiyue, once your master has fully comprehended, you should immediately enter the Mystic Realm to cultivate. You must break through to the fifth-grade True Saint.”

“Yes.”

Si Shiyue nodded.

At this moment, the difference between the holy land and other places of cultivation was gradually revealed.

Qin Yu had comprehended the way of Wu Ji, and in addition to plundering 60% of the spiritual essence of the Black Platform Continent, he had only entered the second grade.

On the other hand, the resources and many places of cultivation in the Holy Region could satisfy the tremendous spiritual energy demand of many cultivators.

It was even more relaxed for the nine great aristocratic families and the various sects.

“Oh yes, chop off Chang Mang’s hands and teleport them to Qin Yu. Didn’t he always say that he wanted to save his buddy?”

Si Wujue said expressionlessly.

“Why must we expend massive spiritual energy to do these things? If Qin Yu is not worth mentioning, our Si family doesn’t need to do so many things against him.”

Si Shiyue frowned and asked.

“I don’t like keeping any threats around. It’s worth spending so much spiritual energy to exchange a pair of hands for his slack dao mind. When you break through to the sixth grade, you can directly go to the Yan family to propose. With the bloodline of our Si family and Immortal Emperor Tianming, we will break through in one go and become the number one family.”

Ji Wujue narrowed his eyes.

…

At the Thunder Academy in the Holy Region.

Jue Wu grabbed Dean Lei’s beard with an unyielding expression at this moment.

“Old man, I don’t care. You must send me to the Black Platform Continent.”

“No. What are you going to do at that lousy place? Moreover, how are you going to come back?”

Dean Lei was very angry.

“I don’t care. If you don’t send me over, I’ll pull your beard.”

Jue Wu tugged hard at Dean Lei’s beard.

“Outrageous! Let go of me!”

Jue Wu totally ignored him and increased her strength, pulling off a few strands of his beard.

“If you’ve thought it through, go ahead.”

Flower Granny Hua said softly by the side.

“No, that place is the continent of exile. How to cultivate there?”
