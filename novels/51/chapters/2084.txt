2085 Dean Lei Attacks?

Dean Lei stroked his beard and said, smiling, “Si Qianjing, long time no see.”

Si Qianjing was silent. He looked unhappy.

Dean Lei swept his gaze across the crowd and said in surprise, “So many people are here today. What’s going on? A gathering of old men?”

Upon hearing Dean Lei’s words, everyone’s expressions became even more unnatural.

“Eh? Didn’t you die back then? So your death is a fake?

“That old man, I remember you have also passed away, right? I heard that you choked to death after eating too many pills. Why did he show up today?

“And you, what’s your name again? You look very familiar.”

Dean Lei rambled on at the side. He did not have the demeanor of an expert at all. Instead, he was like an old playful child.

Everyone’s expressions became increasingly displeased. Si Qianjing shouted, “Enough! Dean Lei, why are you here? Let’s get straight to the point.”

Dean Lei smiled and said, “You should know why I’m here. I want to take Qin Yu away. He’s from Thunder Courtyard.”

Si Qianjing said, narrowing his eyes, “Dean Lei, I don’t think Thunder Courtyard is in charge of this place as it’s outside Thunder Courtyard. This has always been the rule of your Thunder Courtyard. What? Are you going to break this rule with your own hands?”

“I would have forgotten about it if you didn’t mention it,” Dean Lei patted his head and said. “In that case, I’ll take advantage of today being an auspicious day to change this rule. From today onward, no one is allowed to touch the disciples of Thunder Courtyard. Otherwise, it will be taken as a declaration of war against Thunderous Courtyard!”

“You!” Si Qianjing was instantly enraged, and his expression turned even colder.

He looked at Dean Lei and said, “Dean Lei, it’s fine if you want to take him away, but he has to hand over the Traceless Immortal Scripture.”

“Traceless Immortal Scripture…” Dean Lei muttered, and then looked at Qin Yu and said, “Do you have that thing?”

Qin Yu was stunned. Then he quickly said, “No, I haven’t even seen it before!”

“Did you hear that? Qin Yu doesn’t have any Traceless Immortal Scripture,” Dean Lei said with a smile.

Si Qianjing gritted his teeth and said, “Dean Lei, you know very well what the Traceless Immortal Scripture means. He’s definitely not allowed to take it away. No one can change that.”

“But he doesn’t have it at all. How do you expect him to give it to you? How about this? I’ll write you one right away when I get back,” Dean Lei said with a cheeky smile.

No matter how foolish one was, one could see through Dean Lei’s intentions.

He had come here to protect his children. He was unreasonable!

“Dean Lei, we don’t want to be enemies with you. We also respect you very much. However, Qin Yu must hand over this Traceless Immortal Scripture,” a True Saint said.

“That’s right. Traceless Immortal Scripture is of great significance. It cannot be in his hands,” another True Saint said.

Dean Lei rolled his eyes and said, “Oh yes, I remember now. Traceless Immortal Scripture is with me! Sigh, I’m old and muddle-headed. I’ve forgotten…”

“With you? Then quickly hand it over, and you can take him away any time,” Si Qianjing said coldly.

“It’s indeed with me, but I don’t want to give it to you. How about it?” Dean Lei said with a smile.

“Dean Lei, we are both True Saints. Do you think I’m afraid of you?” Si Qianjing shouted.

The other True Saints also stepped forward and intended to attack!

“We didn’t want to be enemies with you, but if you don’t come to your senses, don’t blame us for being ruthless.”

“That’s right. You’re alone, and we’re a dozen of people. We have the chance of winning.”

“I advise you not to destroy Thunder Courtyard because of Qin Yu.”

Qin Yu’s brows were tightly furrowed, and he was tremendously worried in his heart.

Dean Lei almost had no chance of winning against a dozen True Saints!

After all, these were a dozen True Saints, genuine Saint Realm!

“Are you threatening me?” Dean Lei narrowed his eyes slightly.

“You can understand it this way,” Si Qianjing said lightly with his hands behind his back.

Seeing this, Dean Lei nodded. “Then you guys may go ahead. I haven’t moved my old bones for a long time.”

“Do you really dare to fight against a dozen of us?”Si Qianjing shouted.

“Dean Lei, although you have powerful strength, you can’t defeat a dozen True Saints!” a True Saint shouted by the side.

Dean Lei sneered and said, “You’re right. If all of you were at your peak, it would be very difficult for me to defeat you. Unfortunately, your vital energy has depreciated, and you’re not far from death.”

“Aren’t you the same?” Si Qianjing sneered and said.

Dean Lei did not say anything. He took a deep breath, and his body immediately emitted a faint blue light!

Following the appearance of these rays of light, Dean Lei’s internal qi began to soar!

A terrifying pressure swept across the entire world. Not to mention Qin Yu, even Si Qianjing, and the others felt tremendously strong pressure!

“Rumble…”

The earth was trembling as if the heavens and earth were about to collapse!

Si Qianjing and the others’ faces were incomparably ugly, and they even felt a strong pressure on their chests!

“You… Did you burn your blood essence?” a True Saint exclaimed.

“No, he is not at the stage of oil running out and lamp drying up yet… Or rather, he’s still at his peak!” Si Qianjing’s face turned even uglier! FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

No one would have thought a True Saint at the peak of his power was actually still alive!

This kind of deterring power caused fear in everyone!

At this moment, Dean Lei stood in the void with an incredibly terrifying internal qi. He was like a true god.

He glanced at everyone and said with a smile, “Come on, make your move. I don’t mind sending all of you to death today.”

All the True Saints stepped back.

What a joke! It must be crazy to fight with a True Sant at his peak!

Unless they all burned their blood essence, they had no chance of winning!

Even if one burned his blood essence to fight a True Saint at his peak, one would most likely die!

“You’re not talking anymore? I’m taking him away then.” Dean Lei stretched out his palm, and a gentle force brought Qin Yu to his side.

Si Qianjing glared at Dean Lei and said through gritted teeth, “Dean Lei’s means are indeed brilliant. You can actually maintain your peak condition for so many years. We respect you.”

Dean Lei turned to look at Si Qianjing and said, “Why? What else do you want to say?”

“I have nothing to say,” Si Qianjing sneered and said. “I just want to give you a piece of advice. In this era, the younger generation has the hope of entering the True Saint Realm. By then, your advantage will no longer exist.

“For example, Si Liuhe of my Si family. He will definitely visit you if he steps into the True Saint Realm,” Si Qianjing said coldly.
