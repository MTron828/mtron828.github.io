Chapter 2036: The Death Qi Devours the Primordial Spirit

A cunning look flashed across his face. Then, his body shook, and he appeared in front of Chu Tianhe, the head of the Chu family.

Chu Tianhe’s expression changed slightly, and an ominous feeling arose in his heart.

“Are you the head of the Chu family?” the elder of the Si family asked indifferently.

Although Chu Tianhe knew it would not be good things, he still braced himself and said, “Yes, I’m the head of the Chu family, Chu Tianhe.”

“Didn’t you want to befriend our Si family just now? You have a chance now,” the elder said indifferently.

Then he pointed at the Chaos Grave not far away and said, “The Chaos Grave has just opened, and there are endless fortuities. Now, I’ll give you this opportunity. You can send people to explore the Chaos Grave. All the fortuities you get will belong to your Chu family. How about it?”

Hearing this, Chu Tianhe cursed in his heart!

It was clearly asking the Chu family to be cannon fodder, but he had said it in such a dignified manner!

“Elder, our Chu family cannot afford such a fortuity. You should find someone else…” Chu Tianhe smiled awkwardly.

The elder of the Si family snorted. He looked at Chu Tianhe and said indifferently, “The inheritance of an aristocratic family usually requires many opportunities, and one has to pay a price to obtain these opportunities. It’s a good deal to exchange a few people for an opportunity to advance.”

Chu Tianhe was stunned. He understood what the elder of the Si family meant. Either he agreed to go on the adventure or gave up the opportunity to befriend the Si family.

The Chu family was not considered powerful, and compared to the Si family, there was a vast difference, like heaven and earth.

He knew that if he missed this opportunity, it would be tremendously hard to befriend the Si family in the future.

Chu Tianhe pondered for a while and finally made up his mind.

He raised his head and looked at the elder of the Si family. His eyes turned around as if he was thinking.

“There are many people in the Chu family. It doesn’t matter if a few of them die. However, if you can establish diplomatic relations with the Si family, it will be a good thing for your descendants. Perhaps your descendants can join the Si family,” the elder of the Si family continued.

Hearing this, Chu Tianhe became even more excited.

If Chu Sheng entered the Si family, he would definitely soar into the sky!

Even if he couldn’t become a top-notch figure, at least nothing could stop him in the Holy Region!

“Of course, if you’re unwilling, so be it. I believe that there will be people who are willing.” Seeing Chu Tianhe not speak for a long time, the elder of the Si family turned around and was about to leave.

“No, no, no!” Chu Tianhe hurriedly said. “It’s our honor to serve the Si family!”

Then Chu Tianhe designated a few people and handed them over to the elder of the Si family.

Chu Tianhe heaved a sigh of relief and bowed to the elder of the Si family.

“The Si family could have done it by force, but they didn’t do so. Instead, they came to discuss it with me. The Si family is really good people,” Chu Tianhe mumbled.

Qin Yu, who was not far away, coldly watched this scene and sneered in his heart.

Qin Yu became even more disdainful of the Chu family’s doings.

Soon, the descendants of the Chu family were brought to the Chaos Grave by Elder Si.

Although these few young men belonged to the Chu family, their status in the family was very low. Even if they did not want to go, they did not have the right to choose.

As such, their faces were ashen. They knew once they stepped into the Chaos Grave, they would be eternally doomed!

“Perhaps the first fortuity lies with you,” the elder by their side said indifferently.

Regardless of whether they entered or not, they would die. There was still a chance of survival after entering the Chaos Grave. Therefore, these people gritted their teeth and strode into the Chaos Grave!

The Chaos Grave was full of hoary internal qi. The moment they stepped in, the internal qi started to become manic!

In just a while, the bodies of these young men emitted waves of death qi! Their faces even became tremendously distorted!

Unlike the first cultivator who entered the Chaos Grave, these people clearly suffered more pain!

Finally, someone couldn’t help but let out a miserable cry! In the next second, his body was completely devoured by the death qi. In just a few seconds, the eyes of these young people dimmed, and there was no longer any light in their eyes. They stood there like walking corpses, looking at everyone blankly.

“What… What’s going on?”

Seeing what had happened, everyone’s expressions turned incredibly ugly!

Were these people dead or still alive? Or rather, they had become the living dead?

Hmph! The death qi devoured them and turned them into living beings in the Chaos Grave,” Yan Guyun said coldly. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“The living beings in the Chaos Grave? What do you mean?” Everyone turned to look at Yan Guyun.

Yan Guyun put his hands behind his back and said, ” Literally, their divine sense is gone, and they have become a part of the Chaos Grave. Moving on, they will become the living beings guarding the Chaos Grave.

“This kind of internal qi isn’t rare. It happens in many Immortal Emperors’ Big

Graves. The person who gets devoured is called a tomb slave.”

“Tomb slave…”

Everyone was shocked. In that case, as long as one stepped in, one’s primordial spirit would dissipate and become a tomb slave.

“Continue.” Yan Guyun ordered.

However, after seeing this, no one was willing to enter the Chaos Grave anymore.

The destruction of one’s primordial spirit was even more terrifying than death!

The elder of the Si family looked at Chu Tianhe again. Chu Tianhe gritted his teeth and looked back at the cultivators of the Chu family, feeling conflicted.

These people were all disciples of the Chu family. It did not matter to him if a few of them died. However, if they were to die in vain, these cultivators would probably not follow him anymore!

“How troublesome! They are just a bunch of ants. Why do we need to discuss this with them?” Yan Guyun said coldly.

Then he waved his hand, and an invisible force grabbed a few cultivators not far away!

The cultivators struggled desperately, but it was useless in front of Yan Guyun!

Yan Guyun mercilessly threw them into the Chaos Grave, but the outcome was the same. They became tomb slaves and lost their lives.

...

Seeing this, everyone was instantly frightened and retreated one after another, afraid that they would be the next.

Qin Yu’s expression was cold. He looked at Yan Guyun’s arrogant expression and felt incredibly displeased.

“This b*stard.” Qin Yu clenched his fists.

“Do we still want to continue?” Si Liuhe looked at Yan Guyun.

“It’s just the death qi from the Chaos Grave,” Yan Guyun said indifferently. “No one knows what other terrifying beings are in the Chaos Grave.”

After saying that, Yan Guyun pointed at the nine sanctums not far away.

“For example, those nine sanctums. They must be places where one can comprehend the dao. It’s just nice that everyone can take one each,” Yan Guyun said indifferently..
