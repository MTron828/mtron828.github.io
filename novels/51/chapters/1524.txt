Chapter 1525: Chapter 1,525, Zhuo Jing’s strength: 1 

Sima bei sized up Zhuo Jing and the sword in his hand.

“This sword is the famous Silver Spring, right?”Sima bei said with a faint smile.

Zhuo Jing was extremely vigilant. He took two steps back and coldly said, “Who exactly are you? Why are you here?”

“The northern lands, Sima Bei.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Upon hearing this address, Zhuo Jing’s expression instantly changed drastically!

His internal Qi instantly erupted, and his palm and the Silver Spring seemed to have merged into one!

“What do you want to Do?”Zhuo Jing coldly asked.

Sima bei glanced at Qin Yu, who was currently undergoing his tribulation not far away, and lightly smiled, “I’m here to kill him. If you’re sensible, I can spare you if you leave now.”

Zhuo jing sneered, “Do you think I’ll Leave?”

Sima bei sighed slightly and said, “What difference does it make whether you leave or not? What’s the point of risking your life for Nothing?”

“Cut the crap. As long as I’m still standing today, you can forget about touching a single finger of Qin Yu!”Zhuo Jing shouted.

Sima Bei’s eyes narrowed slightly. He looked at Zhuo Jing coldly and said, “Do you think you can stop me with the Silver Spring in your hand?”

“How would I know if I don’t try?”Zhuo Jing said coldly.

......

The expression on Sima Bei’s face gradually turned cold.

“Then I’ll send you on your way!”

Sima bei shouted loudly. His palm was immediately wrapped in black energy and he grabbed towards Zhuo Jing!

Facing such a figure, Zhuo Jing naturally did not dare to be negligent. He directly took out the Silver Spring and slashed out with his sword!

The void-level weapon filled the air at this moment. The sword light was incomparably sharp and arrived in an instant!

The instant the palm came into contact with it, it was actually sliced into two by the Silver Spring! Fresh blood flowed down his arm!

Sima bei looked at his own palm and muttered in a low voice, “As expected of the Silver Spring, it really lives up to its reputation...”

“If you know what’s good for you, hurry up and leave!”Zhuo Jing shouted.

Sima bei narrowed his eyes. With a shake of his palm, the wound actually started to slowly heal!

Zhuo Jing’s expression couldn’t help but change when he saw this.

How could this be! What kind of heaven-defying recovery speed was this! !

At the same time, the internal Qi on Sima Bei’s body also started to become even more terrifying.

This internal Qi even affected Qin Yu, who was undergoing his tribulation!

“Zhuo Jing...”Qin Yu gritted his teeth, and his expression couldn’t help but change slightly.

However, Qin Yu had no time to care about anything else. With their strength, they were not Sima Bei’s match at all!

“Zhuo Jing, you have to hold on...”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

The fourth heavenly tribulation in the sky was already brewing, and the rumbling sounds were endless.

In this world, besides Qin Yu, who was undergoing the heavenly tribulation, there were two other people who were confronting each other.

“Do you still want to continue being stubborn?”Sima bei said coldly.

Zhuo jing sneered, “Cut the crap!”

“Stubborn!”Sima bei snorted coldly. He waved his long robe, and the black energy instantly turned into thousands of rays of light!

This light was like a black icicle, almost merging with the surrounding darkness.

And the power of this light was endless. It tore through the void almost in an instant, and it approached at a fast speed!

Zhuo Jing did not dare to be negligent. He held the Silver Spring in his hand and his body was as light as a swallow. The speed of each sword was extremely fast.

His calmness was even more shocking. Even under such a life and death situation, he did not panic at all.

The countless lights were actually slashed down by his silver spring one sword after another!

“Your movement technique is not bad.”Sima bei said indifferently, “Then... how about this?”

After saying this, Sima bei waved his cannon once again! This time, the black light cones were like raindrops, densely packed together!

With such dense light cones, no matter how fast one was, it was impossible to dodge them!

At this moment, a cold glint flashed in Zhuo Jing’s eyes. He muttered to himself, and in the next second, he seemed to have transformed into thousands of figures, shuttling through the ice cones!

Every time a sword struck down, a light cone would be shattered!

Upon closer inspection, it wasn’t a clone technique at all. Instead, it was an afterimage that was left behind due to its extreme speed!

“Oh? What kind of footwork is this?”Sima bei couldn’t help but feel a little shocked!

This Zhuo Jing didn’t seem simple at all!

“It’s My Zhuo family’s unique spirit cloud step,”Zhuo Jing said coldly.

The Zhuo family didn’t have a powerful physical body, nor did they have powerful strength. Therefore, they relied more on speed to obtain victory.

Rumor has it that Zhuo Jing’s father was once able to slash out thousands of swords in one breath! Although Zhuo Jing wasn’t as powerful as his father, he was still extremely powerful among his peers.

“Rumble...”

At this moment, the fourth round of Heavenly Tribulation in the sky was about to descend.

Looking at the rough lightning in the sky, Sima Bei’s expression couldn’t help but turn cold.

“I can’t continue playing with you,”Sima Bei said coldly.

“Let’s end it early, in case anything happens.”

After saying this, Sima bei raised both his hands, as if he was preparing some spell.

“Blood Crow Boom!”

After a loud shout, an extremely shrill and ear-piercing sound suddenly appeared on the battlefield!

This sound was like countless crows shouting by his ear, directly approaching his divine sense!

Zhuo Jing’s eyes instantly became absent-minded, and it was at this moment that the blood crow boom had already smacked towards Zhuo Jing!

By the time Zhuo Jing regained his senses, it was already too late. No matter how fast his steps were, he could not Dodge!

“Bang!”

The huge energy ball smashed onto Zhuo Jing’s chest, sending him flying hundreds of meters!

“Oh? He didn’t die?”Seeing Zhuo Jing get up from the ground, Sima bei could not help but be a little surprised.

Zhuo Jing got up from the ground, and there was a ray of light on his chest.

He raised his hand to grab it, and saw a jade pendant hanging on his chest. This jade pendant had already shattered.

This was a protective magic artifact that his father had personally refined. After saving Zhuo Jing’s life, it had also completely shattered.

“This bastard’s ability is much stronger than I imagined...”Zhuo Jing said in a deep voice.

What made Zhuo Jing feel even more despair was that this Sima Bei hadn’t used his true strength at all.

“I can’t drag this on any longer. I must kill him when he is serious!”Zhuo Jing said coldly in his heart.

Thinking of this, Zhuo Jing grabbed the Silver Spring. His spiritual power and the Silver Spring had completely fused.

“This technique was created by my father. Back then, he had heavily injured countless return to void stage cultivators,”Zhuo Jing said coldly in his heart.

“Although I am not as strong as my father, I can only give it a try now.”

Zhuo Jing took a deep breath. He held onto the Silver Spring and looked coldly in Sima Bei’s direction.

On the other hand, Sima Bei did not put Qin Yu in his eyes at all. On the contrary, he had a calm expression on his face, like a cat teasing a mouse.

“Green Flame Slash!”

At this moment, Zhuo Jing moved! He held onto the Silver Spring and quickly slashed out a few hundred times in a breath!

The dense sword shadows overlapped with each other. Because they were too fast, the sword shadows could no longer be seen. At a glance, they looked like a ball of green flames!

The terrifying aura blotted out the sky and covered the earth as it headed straight for Si Ma bei! Internal Qi!
