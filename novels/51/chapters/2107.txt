2108 The Vice President

They walked into the courtyard and came to a small building. Hu Kai went upstairs first, followed by Qin Yu and Jue Wu. When they went upstairs, Hu Kai stopped in front of a door and knocked on it.

“Please come in.” A familiar voice came from the room.

Hu Kai pushed open the door, then Qin Yu and Jue Wu followed him into the room. In the room, an elderly man sitting at a desk was reading a book attentively.

He wasn’t tall, but his expression was rather cold and stern. The faintly discernible internal qi he emitted was extremely overbearing.

Seeing Qin Yu and Jue Wu enter, the elderly man raised his head and said with a smile, “You guys are here.”

“You are…” Seeing this elderly man, Qin Yu immediately frowned.

This person was not the Pavilion Master, but the elderly man who had fought with Qin Yu for the Beast Spirit Pill at an auction!

“What? You don’t recognize me anymore?” the elderly man said as he was pouring tea.

Qin Yu came to his senses and hurriedly said, “It’s you, Senior!”

The elderly man waved his hand, indicating for Qin Yu to sit down. Then he called out to Qin Yu and said indifferently, “Since you came to Zhongzhou, why didn’t you look for me?”

Qin Yu laughed bitterly and said, “Senior, ever since I came to Zhongzhou, I’ve been plagued with evil things. How did I dare to disturb you?”

“Oh? Is that true?” the elderly man said indifferently.

Qin Yu was a little embarrassed for a moment. In fact, he had long forgotten about this matter. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Moreover, it seemed to be just a polite remark at that time. Given Qin Yu’s personality, he would not stoop to flattery.

“Let me introduce. This is the vice president of the Alchemist Association, Li Shen,” Hu Kai, sitting at the side, said indifferently.

Qin Yu was shocked.

He did not expect this person to be the Alchemist Association’s vice president!

Qin Yu was even more shocked that this Alchemist Association and the Artifact Refining Guild actually had such a close relationship!

“Qin Yu, I’ve seen for myself your talent in alchemy. Are you interested in joining the Alchemist Association?” Li Shen went straight to the point.

Looking at Li Shen in a daze, Qin Yu could hardly believe these words.

As Qin Yu had offended too many people, a normal person might want to avoid him desperately. Why did he invite him proactively?

“What? You’re unwilling?” Li Shen took a sip of tea and said indifferently.

“To tell you the truth, I’ve seen many talented people,” Li Shen said indifferently. “Although your talent is indeed impressive, it’s really not worth me personally inviting you.”

Qin Yu did not dare to say anything and waited for him to continue.

“However, someone has recommended you to me,” Li Shen said indifferently.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment before saying, “Is the person you’re talking about Ji Yuhong?”

“That’s right,” Li Shen answered right away.

“According to her, your talent is even above hers. Although I don’t quite believe it, I’m still willing to recruit you to join the Alchemist Association,” Li Shen said with a faint smile.

“Is she doing fine now?” Qin Yu asked hurriedly.”

“Don’t worry, she’s fine. You should take care of yourself.” Li Shen could not help but shake his head.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “President Li, I now can be said the public enemy of the nine great aristocratic families. If I join the Alchemist Association at this point, I will likely bring trouble to the Alchemist Association…”

“Hahaha!” Li Shen waved his hand and said, “Do you think the nine great aristocratic families will attack the Alchemist Association? Moreover, you have Thunder Courtyard backing you up.

“The Alchemist Association, the Artifact Refining Guild, or Thunder Courtyard, any of these alone might not be sufficient to cause fear to the nine great aristocratic families. However, once the three join forces, no one in the Holy Region would dare to show disrespect.

“To tell you the truth, other than because of your talent and Ji Yuhong, I’m inviting you to join the Alchemist Association for another reason.”

“Because of Thunder Courtyard?” Qin Yu asked in a deep voice.”

“That’s right!” Li Shen nodded in satisfaction.

“All these years, our Alchemist Association has always been seeking opportunities to cooperate with Thunder Courtyard. We have wanted Dean Lei to establish an exclusive peak for the Alchemist Association in Thunder Courtyard to recruit talents. Unfortunately, Dean Lei has repeatedly rejected us. However, with you around, there might be a chance,” Li Shen said with a smile.

“Why doesn’t your Alchemist Association set up a separate academy to recruit talents?”

“That doesn’t conform to my Alchemist Association’s initial intentions. You can also see that the Alchemist Association’s reputation in the Holy Region isn’t considered great. It’s because our Alchemist Association is unwilling to be tainted by the secular world,” Li Shen explained.

“Oh, isn’t that a b*tch building a chastity memorial arch?” Jue Wu muttered softly.

Qin Yu’s face darkened, and he could not help but break out in cold sweat.

As for Li Shen, he could not help but burst into laughter.

“Your words may be rough, but the underlying meaning is valid,” Li Shen said with a faint smile. Then, he looked at Jue Wu and said, “You must be the personal disciple of Dean Lei?”

“That’s right.” Jue Wu did not hide anything and immediately responded.

“With the help of the two of you, I believe Dean Lei will agree.”

Qin Yu was silent as if he was considering it.

“I can give you a few days to consider.” Li Shen immediately expressed his stance when he saw the situation.

Qin Yu laughed bitterly and said, “Although I yearn for the Alchemist Association, my aspiration is not focused on this. I’ll definitely visit you if there’s a chance in the future.”

After saying this, Qin Yu looked at Jue Wu and continued, “President Li, if you want to cooperate with Thunder Courtyard, you don’t have to go through me. Jue Wu’s help is sufficient.”

Qin Yu had too many things to do at the moment. How would he have the mood to refine medicine?

Moreover, the day of the Path of Heaven was about to come. At that time, Qin Yu would probably be wandering the world far and wide with Yan Ruoxue.

“Are you really not joining?” Li Shen said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu nodded emphatically and said, “I’m really sorry. I have failed to live up to your kind intentions.”

“Alright, I won’t force you then.” Li Shen waved his hand.

Qin Yu bowed slightly to express his apology.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

“Oh yes, President Li, I would like to trouble you with something,” Qin Yu hurriedly said.

Li Shen nodded slightly, indicating for Qin Yu to continue.

Thinking of Yao Meng, Qin Yu frowned and said. “I have a friend who has been infected with a deadly poison. She is unable to cultivate now. In this world, only the Alchemist Association can save her. Therefore, I…”

“No.” Li Shen shook his head. “According to the rules of the Alchemist Association, we absolutely won’t make a move. Even the nine great aristocratic families have to depend on our mood.”

Qin Yu sighed and could only nod helplessly.

At this moment, Li Shen swiftly changed the subject and continued, “But… If you join the Alchemist Association, the Alchemist Association will have a valid excuse to help your friend.”
