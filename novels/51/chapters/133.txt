Chapter 134: Reckoning! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Wu Hongchang’s face was as pale as a sheet of paper. Fear had already occupied his entire mind!

“No... Impossible!” Wu Hongchang roared angrily and clenched his fist once again!

This time, Qin Yu raised his hand and met it with a punch.

“Kacha!”

A terrifying force traveled from Wu Hongchang’s fist to his entire arm!

With this punch, Wu Hongchang’s entire arm actually shattered!

“Ah! ! !” Wu Hongchang couldn’t help but shout out in pain.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “It seems that I was too soft-hearted. But speaking of which, I have to thank you. In the future, I will remember to never show mercy to people like you.”

Wu Hongchang was already panicking. He retreated and said in horror, “Qin... Qin Yu, it was Liu Yi who sent me here. It has nothing to do with me. If you want to settle the account, go look for him...”

“Liu Yi?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

“That’s true. It’s time for the enmity with the Liu family to be ended,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Wu Hongchang hurriedly nodded and said, “Yes, yes. You should go look for the Liu family. Go look for them!”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Okay, but I will bring you with me.”

After saying that, Qin Yu took a step forward and punched Wu Hongchang’s lower abdomen fiercely.

With a loud bam, Wu Hongchang was sent flying!

His internal organs were instantly blown apart, and blood gushed out of his mouth like a fountain!

Wu Hongchang fell to the ground. He tried to get up, but Qin Yu raised his foot and stomped on his chest!

With this stomp, Wu Hongchang’s chest instantly sank several degrees! His bones were shattered!

And Wu Hongchang didn’t even have time to repent before he died.

Qin Yu, his face emotionless, looked at his corpse.

He turned around and walked in front of Yao Qing while saying, “Are you okay?”

Yao Qing shook his head, then said with some surprise and joy, “Mr. Qin, you already knew?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I didn’t know, but I was wary toward Wu Hongchang.”

What a joke. Qin Yu wouldn’t even completely believe in Lei Hu, let alone Wu Hongchang?

The moment Qin Yu swallowed the pill, he isolated it with spiritual energy.

The moment the spiritual energy touched the pill, it turned black, so Qin Yu knew that there was something wrong with the pill.

“Sigh, looks like I have to go to the bathroom to poop it out,” Qin Yu muttered.

After saying that, Qin Yu went straight to the bathroom.

Ten minutes later, Qin Yu took Wu Hongchang’s corpse and left the hotel to head straight for the Liu family’s home.

“Mr. Liu, it’s my great honor to be able to work with you. I will remember your great kindness!” Sun Fu was holding a glass of wine with an obsequious look on his face.

Liu Yi glanced at him, and a trace of disdain flashed across his face. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

If it wasn’t because of the incident with Qin Yu that caused the Liu family’s business to dwindle, Liu Yi wouldn’t even consider Sun Fu.

“I never dreamed that I, Sun Fu, would have the qualifications to work with you. Mr. Liu, I... I’ll drink all of this!” Sun Fu held his wine cup and said excitedly.

Liu Yi just nodded casually and didn’t even say anything.

Sun Fu was the only one at the dining table who was chatting non-stop, but the Liu family’s father and son didn’t say a word.

“Enough. Don’t you find it annoying to be chattering nonstop?” Liu Shihui said impatiently.

A hint of embarrassment flashed across Sun Fu’s face. He said with a sheepish smile, “I’m sorry, Young Master Liu. I... I’ll punish myself with three cups!”

“If you like to drink so much, take the bottle and drink it all.” Liu Shihui grabbed the bottle and placed it on the table with a clang.

Sun Fu knew that Liu Shihui was making things difficult for him, but he had no choice but to submit to them.

Therefore, he gritted his teeth, grabbed the bottle of wine, and said, “Okay, I’ll drink the entire bottle!”

“What an idiot,” Liu Shihui couldn’t help but mutter.

His voice wasn’t loud, but Sun Fu heard it clearly.

Although he was angry inside, he didn’t dare to flare up.

At this moment, the door of the living room was suddenly kicked open!

Then, they saw Qin Yu walk in from outside the door.

The moment they saw Qin Yu, the three people in the living room stood up at the same time!

Before the Liu family’s father and son could say anything, Sun Fu pointed at Qin Yu and scolded, “What are you doing here? Is this a place where someone like you can come? If there’s anything, wait for me to go home!”

After saying this, Sun Fu hurriedly apologized to the Liu family’s father and son, “Mr. Liu, Young Master Liu, I’m sorry. I’ll let him go now.”

Then, Sun Fu pulled Qin Yu to the side and said with a dark expression, “Get out of here. Do you hear me? If you ruin my business, I’ll kill you!”

Qin Yu sneered. “Do you think I’m here to find you?”

“What else could you be here for? Don’t think I don’t know about your ulterior motives!” Sun Fu said impatiently.

He took out a few hundred yuan from his pocket and threw them to Qin Yu while saying with a cold expression, “Get out of here quickly!”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel baffled. Sun Fu was too full of himself.

Sun Fu was about to say something when Liu Shihui shouted, “Qin Yu, you actually dare to come to my house? How dare you?!”

“Why wouldn’t I dare to come?” Qin Yu said with a cold expression.

Sun Fu was stunned. He looked at Liu Shihui in a daze and said in shock, “Young Master Liu, you... you know him?”

Liu Shihui ignored Sun Fu and said through gritted teeth, “Qin Yu, you won’t be able to stay arrogant for long. To tell you the truth, we have already sent someone to take your life!”

“Take my life? With that trash Wu Hongchang?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and pointed at the door.

The Liu family’s father and son turned their heads to look and saw Wu Hongchang’s body hanging on the door! It looked extremely horrifying!

Their expressions changed dramatically!

Wu Hongchang... was actually dead?

Qin Yu sat on the sofa. He poured himself a glass of water and said coldly, “Even if you want to find someone to kill me, you should find someone decent. You found this kind of trash to send himself to his death?”

The Liu family’s father and son couldn’t help but feel a little nervous. Liu Yi even took two steps back.

“Qin Yu, what... what do you want to do?” Liu Yi said with a cold expression.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said coldly, “What do I want to do? What do you think?”

“When you sent people to kill me, you should have considered the consequences.”

Liu Yi gritted his teeth and tried his best to remain calm as he said, “Qin Yu, tell me. What do you want to do?”

Qin Yu sneered. “How about this? Both of you kneel down and apologize to me sincerely. Then, I can consider sparing you guys.”

“In your dreams!” Liu Yi immediately flew into a rage!

“Qin Yu, who do you think you are? How dare you make us kneel down and apologize? For the Liu family, killing you is like... Ah!”

Before Liu Shihui could finish his words, Qin Yu had already slapped him.

Liu Shihui’s body was sent flying and he crashed into the wall!

Qin Yu slowly stood up from the sofa. He emitted a terrifying murderous aura!

“I was too merciful to you guys in the past. You guys really thought I was a pushover, didn’t you?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes menacingly. Even the atmosphere in the room tensed up!
