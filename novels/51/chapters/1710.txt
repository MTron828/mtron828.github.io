Chapter 1711: About to be Resurrected Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

A lot of the dark energy in the surroundings disappeared overnight.

Even Qin Yu was surprised by the speed of the change.

Fortunately, the dark energy in the area resumed its original density the next morning. This way, no one could detect it.

“As expected of North Plain,” Qin Yu sighed.

Suddenly, he was startled as if he thought of something.

“Why is the dark energy in North Plain so terrifying?” Qin Yu was stunned.

He couldn’t help but recall in his mind what Xiao Sheng had said.

At the beginning of the great change in the world, the dark energy woulddissipate due to the strong impact.

However, North Plain was not affected at all. If that was the case, was North Plain indeed a battlefield or the Big Grave of a particular great cultivator?

Other than these two scenarios, what else would not be affected?

Qin Yu lowered his head and looked at the ground.

It was a land full of ice and snow that had been frozen for an unknown period of time.

The powerful dark energy here had even changed its environment.

Qin Yu then thought of Immortal Slaying Sect.

The strength of the Immortal Slaying Sect was self-evident. It was once the number one sect in the universe and was incomparably powerful.

And Yuan Xiu had obtained the inheritance of the Immortal Slaying Sect. Could it be that the people buried in North Plain were the top-notch great cultivators of the Immortal Slaying Sect?

Or could it be that this was a battlefield of the Immortal Slaying Sect?

However, it was different from what Qin Yu had seen when he was on Earth. He had seen with his own eyes that the sect master of the Immortal Slaying Sect died in Xiao Yu’s hands. How could he be buried in the Holy Region?

“Strange.” Qin Yu frowned. He stared at the ground and was even more curious.

Perhaps the current North Plain was not the true appearance of North Plain.

And the true North Plain had long been covered by the white snow that filled the sky.

Qin Yu took a deep breath. Although he wanted to investigate, the current conditions did not allow him to do so. Thus he could only give up for the time being.

He slightly closed his eyes and continued to absorb the dark energy from North Plain.

The battle with Yong Ji would take place after two days. Qin Yu indeed needed to make some preparations.

On the same day.

Being led by He Teng, the cultivators of North Plain once again stepped into the northern border.

He Teng’s tactics were very different from Yong Ji’s.

He would not fight Li Cheng head-on. Instead, he would plot and use a crafty scheme to the extreme.

After the great battle, countless people died under the painting scroll.

It was not an exaggeration to say that Nanzhou had suffered heavy losses while North plain had returned fully loaded.

That night.

Sima Bei held the painting scroll and said wittingly or unwittingly, “Tue enough, making a choice is very important in everything we do.”

These words were clearly directed at Yong Ji, who had always thought of himself as being good at plotting. He instantly felt a great humiliation.

He looked coldly at Sima Bei and said, “If it weren’t for me taking the lead, we wouldn’t have had such a harvest today.”

“You’re wrong,” Sima Bei mocked.

“If it weren’t for you taking the lead, there would only be one result. North Plain wouldn’t have lost so many people.”

Hearing these words, Yong Ji couldn’t hold it in any longer.

He suddenly stood up and said angrily, “Sima Bei, don’t go too far!”

Sima Bei sneered and said, “What? Are you angry out of humiliation? You can’t hold it in any longer?”

“You!”

Yong Ji was extremely angry. He gritted his teeth and said, “Sima Bei, when this battle is over, I will definitely experience your brilliant move.”

“Hehe! That will depend on whether you can survive until that day,” Sima Bei sneered and said.

After saying this, Sima Bei turned around and walked out.

He took the painting scroll and rushed toward the snowy mountain right at the center of North Plain. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

After that, Sima Bei threw the painting scroll into the sky. The painting scroll seemed to have been given life as it lingered in the sky above the mountain and emitted rays of light.

Countless internal qi surged into the iceberg. The internal qi accumulated in the painting scroll was absorbed by Yuan Xiu in an extremely short time.

After absorbing the scroll, Yuan Xiu, who had been asleep for a long time, finally reacted.

The huge snow mountain trembled slightly. Yuan Xiu’s voice sounded from the depth of the snowy mountain.

“Has the dead river disappeared?” Yuan Xiu asked coldly.

Sima Bei cupped his hands and said, “Lord, it has already disappeared.”

Yuan Xiu snorted and said, “It’s much faster than I expected.”

Sima Bei quickly said, “Lord, please rest assured. I will guard here during this period and won’t let anyone come near.”

“Mmm.” Yuan Xiu responded and said indifferently, “At most a month, I will be resurrected completely. If the painting scroll absorbs enough power, the time can even be shortened to half.”

“Lord, He Teng will do a good job,” Sima Bei quickly said.

Yuan Xiu did not say anything else. Everything became quiet again.

The voice attracted Qin Yu, who was in the distance.

Qin Yu opened his eyes slightly and said softly, “It’s the voice of Yuan Xiu…”

At this moment, Qin Yu also had the intention of imitating Xiao Hai and going to wipe out the snowy mountain. Unfortunately, with Qin Yu’s strength, he was unable to do so.

“One month…” Qin Yu muttered.

He wanted to spread this news, but after hesitating for a long time, he finally gave up.

It was because he didn’t want more people to die tragically in North Plain.

However, things could often backfire.

The following day.

North Plain stepped into Nazhou for the third time. This time, it was still He Teng who led the team.

Under He Teng’s leadership, every North Plain cultivator was like a ghost. Countless people died tragically in the hands of the cultivators of North Plain.

Looking at the miserable situation in front of him, Li Cheng’s expression became even more unsightly.

A trace of determination flashed across his aged face as if he had made a decision.

“If this continues, the cultivators of Nanzhou only die in vain.” Li Cheng let out a long breath.

After a while, Li Cheng’s figure slowly disappeared.

On that day.

Nazhou again suffered heavy losses, and the source of all this was He Teng.

Besides He Teng, another painting scroll was brought back.

That person was none other than Li Yingying!

She relied on her Nanzhou identity to secretly travel to the various small cities of Nanzhou and massacre countless people!

Sima Bei took several painting scrolls and once again arrived at the foot of the snowy mountain.

He threw the internal qi of the painting scrolls into the snowy mountain. Once again, the snowy mountain had a small-scale collapse as if it was about to be shattered at any moment.

After doing all this, Sima Bei did not leave.

He placed his hands behind his back and looked in a specific direction.

“Someone is indeed coming.” Sima Bei narrowed his eyes and sneered.

In the distance, an old man stared at the ice and snow as he rushed toward the snowy mountain.

After a long time, Li Cheng finally arrived at the foot of the snowy mountain.

“You indeed dare to come,” Sima Bei sighed and said.

“If I’m not wrong, the person who injured Yong Ji is you.”

Li Cheng nodded slightly and said, “You can call Yong Ji over and let him take revenge.”

“Oh?” Sima Bei raised his eyebrows.

“Looks like you’re very confident.”

Li Cheng did not answer. He closed his eyes slightly and really wanted Sima Bei to call Yong Ji over.
