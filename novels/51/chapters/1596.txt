Chapter 1597: Chapter 1,597, news from the northern border Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The two of them walked for an unknown period of time before they arrived at Qu Zhu’s wind bamboo mountain.

Before they even stepped into the wind bamboo mountain, qu Zhu had already been waiting for them.

It wasn’t that he had a divine plan. It was just that he had smelled a powerful internal qi and killing intent and mistook it for an enemy. That was why he had left early to wait.

When he saw that it was Qin Yu, he couldn’t help but be slightly surprised.

Then, qu Zhu’s gaze fell on iron egg.

“This is?”Qu Zhu asked curiously.

“I am the most powerful Asura in this world. Call me...”

“Just call him iron egg.”

Before Iron Egg could finish his speech, he was interrupted by Qin Yu.

“F * ck you! Your Name is Iron Egg!”Iron Egg flew into a rage.

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered with him. He looked at Qu Zhu and said, “He’s a friend of mine. Don’t worry.”

“Your friend... has such a strong internal QI,”qu Zhu said in a low voice.

He couldn’t help but look at iron egg warily. For some reason, he felt that iron egg didn’t look like a good person.

Qin Yu couldn’t explain to Qu Zhu, so he could only change the topic.

Then, Qin Yu told qu Zhu about Xiao Hai.

Qu Zhu couldn’t help but look surprised after hearing that. Then, he said with a smile, “Brother Xiao Hai... he always does amazing things, forcefully pulling the two plates. I don’t think anyone would dare to think about it except him.”

Qin Yu said with a wry smile, “Yes, that’s why I need your help now.”

Qu Zhu didn’t refuse and simply agreed.

After qu Zhu agreed, Qin Yu planned to go directly to Zhuo Jing. After all, the materials were all found by Zhuo Jing.

Then, qu Zhu found an opportunity to bring Qin Yu to the side and said in a deep voice, “Qin Yu, you have to be careful of your friend. His body... has a natural evil, a kind of uncontrollable evil.”

Qin Yu glanced at iron egg not far away and nodded, “I know. Don’t worry, senior Qu Zhu.”

Qu Zhu grunted in gratitude and did not say anything more.

“How’s Jue Wu recently?”Qin Yu asked.

Qu Zhu spread his hands and said, “Still the same.”

Qin Yu sighed slightly and said, “It’s better to bring her with us to the northern lands this time. Otherwise, I won’t be at ease.”

“That’s exactly what I was thinking,”qu Zhu said.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of iron egg.

“Do you know how to refine pills?”Qin Yu asked.

Iron Egg glanced at qin yu and said, “I don’t know how to make a chicken.”

Seeing this, Qin Yu didn’t ask any more questions.

Then, Qin Yu and iron egg followed qu Zhu and walked into wind bamboo mountain.

They came all the way to the sleeping room of internal Qi. At this time, internal Qi was as usual, lying on the bed motionlessly, and her breath was very faint.

Looking at her young face, Qin Yu had an indescribable feeling.

“HMM? Nirvana body?”

At this moment, iron egg suddenly frowned.

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s eyes lit up. He hurriedly looked at iron egg and said, “You know about Nirvana Body?”

“Nonsense. I’ve traveled all over the world, thinking back to those years...”

“Okay, stop bragging. Do you know how to break the curse of the Nirvana Body?”Qin Yu interrupted iron egg.

Iron Egg said in a deep voice, “I’ve heard of a method.”

“What method?”Qin Yu hurriedly asked.

Iron Egg shook his head and said, “I forgot.”

“You...”Qin Yu couldn’t help but clench his fists. He wanted to punch him.

“Let me think about it. Maybe I’ll remember it someday,”said Iron Egg.

Qin Yu didn’t want to waste time talking to Iron Egg. After thinking for a while, he put the final dance into the bronze coffin.

This coffin had preserved this god body intact for so many years. It must have its unique features. It was the best choice to carry the final dance.

After carrying the final dance, the group of three headed straight for Zhuo Jing’s residence.

The group of three headed straight for the Zhuo family.

Riding on the Divine Eagle, they flew high up in the sky.

As always, cultivators from the northern lands could be seen everywhere in the South Province. It was as if they had settled down here. They could be seen every few weeks.

After a long time, the three of them finally arrived at the Zhuo family.

Unfortunately, Zhuo Jing was not at home. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

His guests informed Qin Yu that Zhuo Jing had gone out for several days and had yet to return.

Hearing this, Qin Yu could not help but guess, “Zhuo Jing should have gone to look for materials for me.”

“Zhuo family, his father back then was also a legend of a generation,”qu Zhu said with a sigh.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Senior Qu Zhu, do you know his father?”

Qu Zhu shook his head and said, “I don’t know him. I’ve only heard of him.”

Qin Yu nodded and didn’t continue to ask.

Iron Egg closed his eyes slightly. His divine sense covered almost half of the Zhuo family.

“This Zhuo family has quite a lot of treasures,”iron egg said in a low voice.

Hearing this, Qin Yu warned, “Don’t have any ideas about their treasures. Never steal them. Do You Hear Me?”

Iron Egg glanced at Qin Yu and sneered, “Steal? I always rob the things I like. Stealing? That’s cowardly behavior.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but stick out his tongue.

If this was heard by man with the mustache, he didn’t know what he would think.

In the next few days, Qin Yu and Qu Zhu temporarily stayed in the Zhuo family.

The guests of the Zhuo family were very curious about the two of them, and they came to visit almost every day.

As time went by, Qin Yu could be considered to be on good terms with them.

Speaking of which, Zhuo Jing was quite generous. The large Zhuo family allowed these guests to come and go as they pleased and never did anything to stop them.

Whether it was eating, drinking, or having fun, the Zhuo family had almost guaranteed it. This also resulted in Zhuo Jing being extremely popular among the younger generation. His connections were extremely wide and could even be said to be able to get hundreds of responses at once.

A few days later.

Qin Yu and the many guests sat under the gazebo as usual, drinking tea and chatting. At this time, Zhuo Jing walked over from not far away.

“Young Master Zhuo, you’re back.”

Seeing Zhuo Jing, the many guests stood up one after another and warmly greeted Zhuo Jing.

Zhuo Jing also responded with a smile. Then, his gaze fell on Qin Yu.

Qin Yu hurriedly stood up and followed Zhuo Jing to the side.

“How is it? Have you prepared the materials?”Qin Yu asked.

Zhuo Jing was silent for a moment, and his expression was extremely grave.

“What’s Wrong?”Seeing this expression, Qin Yu immediately had a bad feeling.

Zhuo jing sighed and said, “I think you don’t need to look for these materials anymore.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu frowned and said, “What do you mean?”

Zhuo Jing said in a deep voice, “Do you still remember what I told you? It’s very likely that senior Xiao Hai was trying to send you away. Now, his words have been confirmed.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything, but he had a bad premonition in his heart.

“I just received news that senior Xiao Hai forcefully crossed the Dead River and went to the northern border. Now, he has been fighting with the three godly monarchs of the northern land for several days,”Zhuo Jing said in a deep voice.
