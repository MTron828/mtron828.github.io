The Power-dissipating Pill was forcefully stuffed into Han Shixun’s mouth by Qin Yu.

Following that, Qin Yu clapped his hands, and the pill fell into Han Shixun’s stomach.

The instant the pill fell into his stomach, it burst out like a small bomb!

Han Shixun desperately clutched his throat and tried to dig it out, but it was already too late!

The pill quickly spread in his body, and waves of intense pain came from his dantian!

“Qin Yu, you... are courting death!” Han Shixun roared angrily.

Qin Yu, however, was expressionless and said coldly, “You brought this upon yourself.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Han Shixun clenched his teeth and said, “I’m a member of the Han family. How dare you treat me like this?!”

When he heard Han Shixun’s words, Qin Yu slapped his head and suddenly understood.

“Oh, right, you’re a member of the Han family, so I can’t forgive you,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Then, Qin Yu strode forward and kicked Han Shixun’s lower abdomen!

This kick sent Han Shixun flying dozens of meters!

The intense pain in his dantian instantly increased by several times!

“Ah! !” Han Shixun clutched his lower abdomen and knelt on the ground!

However, in the next second, Han Shixun’s expression turned extremely ugly!

He pointed at Qin Yu in disbelief and said in pain, “You... you actually broke my dantian?”

Qin Yu sneered. “People like you will bring harm upon people sooner or later. It’s better to cripple you as soon as possible.”

Everyone was terrified when they heard it!

They were afraid of Qin Yu’s ruthlessness!

“Qin Yu, I want you to die!” Han Shixun roared crazily!

He, wishing that he could tear Qin Yu into pieces, glared at Qin Yu!

“If you dare to talk nonsense again, I will kill you right now.” Qin Yu’s murderous aura suddenly burst out!

After feeling this murderous aura, Han Shixun felt as if a fishbone was stuck in his throat, and he couldn’t say a word!

No one expected that not only was Qin Yu not afraid of the Han family, but he had even shattered Han Shixun’s dantian!

After all, that was the Han family! An elite family in Jingdu!

“Just you wait!” Han Shixun climbed up from the ground.

With the help of his bodyguards, he walked out with difficulty.

The clinic became quiet. Everyone looked at each other, as if they couldn’t believe that this was true.

Qin Yu, on the other hand, sat there as if nothing had happened, and was doing whatever he was supposed to do.

Taozi frowned. She walked forward and said, “People of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion can’t hit people.”

Qin Yu sneered. “At worst, I’ll just leave.”

Taozi was silent for a moment and said, “I’ll testify for you. It was Han Shixun who started the trouble first.”

“No need.” Qin Yu waved his hand.

He was already prepared to be kicked out of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

At this moment, the Fifth Elder suddenly rushed in from outside.

He walked quickly to Qin Yu and said in surprise, “You crippled Han Shixun?”

Qin Yu didn’t hide anything and nodded. “I crippled him.”

“You...” the Fifth Elder suddenly didn’t know what to say.

“Do you know that he is a direct descendant of the Han Family?” Fifth Elder asked anxiously.

Qin Yu said coldly, “The Han family and I were enemies even before this. One more won’t make a difference. One less won’t make a difference.”

“Fifth Elder, don’t worry. I won’t implicate the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.” Qin Yu stood up and said.

Fifth Elder didn’t know what to say for a moment.

He suddenly seemed to have thought of something and frowned. “Who told you to come to the consultation room?”

Before Qin Yu could say anything, Taozi said anxiously, “It’s Third Elder.”

“Third Elder!” A flash of anger appeared on the Fifth Elder’s face!

“He must have done it on purpose! He must have done it on purpose!” Fifth Elder said angrily.

As soon as he finished speaking, he saw the Third Elder walk in from outside the door.

He put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Qin Yu, how dare you! I told you to come to the consultation room, but you actually crippled him?”

Qin Yu glanced at him and didn’t say anything.

He now believed in Taozi’s words.

The Third Elder did it on purpose.

“Third Elder, why did you ask Qin Yu to come to the clinic?” Fifth Elder said coldly.

The Third Elder didn’t care at all. He snorted and said, “As an elder, I can order a pharmacist to come to the clinic. Is there a problem?”

“But you clearly know that Qin Yu has a grudge against the Han clan!” Fifth Elder berated angrily.

The Third Elder pretended to be surprised and said, “Is that so? I really didn’t know, but... does this have anything to do with the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?”

“Even if he has a grudge, he can’t hit people. And he is so ruthless. Isn’t he tarnishing the reputation of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?” Third Elder said with a sarcastic tone.

“You!” Fifth Elder was so angry that glared at him. He wished he could swallow the Third Elder alive.

Qin Yu glanced at the Third Elder, stood up and said, “I don’t think I have offended you before, right? Why did you set me up?”

The Third Elder pointed at Qin Yu and said, “Don’t talk nonsense. Who set you up?”

Qin Yu ignored him and continued to analyze, “From your appearance, you should be eighty to ninety years old, right?”

“If I’m not wrong, you probably only have a red spiritual fire? Or you don’t even have a spiritual fire.”

“You’ve been in the Divine Alchemist pavilion for so many years and you became an elder purely because of your seniority, right? Or perhaps, the Pavilion Master pitied you?”

Speaking up to this point, Qin Yu paused for a moment. He rubbed his chin and said, “So I’m guessing that you’re a good-for-nothing with a strong jealousy tendency. Seeing that Taozi and I were born with spiritual fire, you felt indignant and jealous, right?”

These few words made the Third Elder blush!

And the Fifth Elder clapped his hands!

“Qin Yu, how did you know?” Fifth Elder said in surprise.

Qin Yu said with a nonchalant smile, “I guessed. He’s a man in his eighties to nineties and is only an Inner Strength Past Master. Moreover, he has access to such good resources from the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. If he isn’t a good-for-nothing, then what is?”

The Third Elder was so angry that his face turned ashen. He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “You sharp-tongued little b*stard. When the Pavilion Master comes back, I’ll see how you will explain!”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Explain? What do I have to explain? At worst, I’ll just leave. Anyway, I can still survive after leaving the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

“Unlike you, if I leave the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, I’m afraid you would be unable to find a job.”

“Okay! Let’s wait and see!” The Third Elder said angrily.

He knew that he couldn’t win against Qin Yu, so he no longer looked for trouble. He immediately flicked his sleeves and left.

Qin Yu’s words were greeted with waves of cheers.

Even Taozi’s eyes had a hint of admiration.

“Qin Yu, don’t worry. I’ll explain it to the Pavilion Master,” Fifth Elder comforted.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “There’s no need for that.”

After all, in Qin Yu’s opinion, the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion wouldn’t offend the entire Han family for Qin Yu alone.

Sometimes, right and wrong weren’t important. What was important was benefits.
