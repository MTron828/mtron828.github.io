Chapter 859: Chapter 859, the eight higher-ups!

The pavilion head opened her mouth, but she couldn’t say anything.

She could clearly feel the cold killing intent from Qin Yu.

This killing intent was extremely pure, and it sent chills down people’s spines.

“Oh right, pavilion head, do you know where there are Mystic Realm Masters?”Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

“Mystic Realm Masters?”The pavilion head frowned.

“Usually, only extremely large forces and organizations would have Mystic Realm Masters, because Mystic Realm Masters are too rare.”Pavilion master shook his head.

“As expected.”Qin Yu sighed slightly.

If she had known earlier, she would not have killed Zheng Ke so early.

At least take her to the Green Moon Villa’s spirit spring to take a look. There was an ownerless mystic realm hidden there.

I can only place my hopes on the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, Qin Yu thought to herself.

As long as Gu Xinghe was captured, Qin Yu could negotiate terms.

And Gu Zizhen’s relationship with the higher-ups of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association was clearly not as humble as Granny Qin’s. Presumably, she would be able to get what she wanted.

In the next few days, Qin Yu did not leave the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

And everything was as the Pavilion Master had said. It was the end of the year, and the various major factions did not come again.

Time flew by. In the blink of an eye, there were only three days left before the New Year.

Early one morning, Qin Yu came to the pavilion master’s building.

“Pavilion Master, I plan to go to the northwest Lei family,”Qin Yu said.

The pavilion master said in a deep voice, “Although the Lei family is not very famous, their strength is still extremely tyrannical. After all, they are an old aristocratic family.”

Qin Yu sighed and said, “Sigh, I can’t find any other targets for the time being. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have chosen the Lei family to act.”

At this moment, the pavilion master seemed to have suddenly thought of something.

“I remember that at the end of the year, the purple robes of the Jingdu martial arts association would gather once and hold a meeting,”the pavilion master said faintly.

Qin Yu’s brows raised and he said, “You mean... you want me to go to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?”

“I didn’t say that.”The pavilion master spread his hands.

Qin Yu laughed and said, “I understand. I’ll go to Jingdu now.”

After saying goodbye to the Pavilion Master, Qin Yu went straight to Jingdu.

Compared to the purple robe, the influence of the Lei family was obviously far inferior.

After all, the purple robe represented the highest combat strength on the surface of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

At this moment, there were many cars parked at the entrance of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

These cars were of all shapes and sizes, and there were all kinds of luxury cars.

And the owner of these cars was the purple robe who worked for the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

Many purple robes gathered at the entrance, exchanging greetings and waiting for the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s notice.

Ten minutes later.

Xia hang walked out from inside.

“The higher-ups have summoned you to the conference room,”Xia Hang said.

Hearing this, a hint of shock and excitement flashed across the faces of the purple-robed men.

“Higher-ups? The one holding the conference this time is actually the higher-ups?”One of the purple-robed men said excitedly.

“In the past, it’s Always Granny Qin. It’s almost impossible for us to meet the higher-ups!”

“That’s great. I didn’t expect that we would actually be able to meet the higher-ups!”

Xia hang explained, “Because Gu Xinghe has returned to the second secret realm, the higher-ups will personally hold the conference for you this time.”

“President Xia, hurry up and take us there, we can’t wait any longer!”More than twenty purple-robed men said excitedly.

Xia hang nodded, turned around and walked into the Jingdu martial arts association, leading everyone to the meeting room of the higher-ups.

The meeting room was pitch black, and the weak light added a layer of solemnity and mystery to the entire meeting room.

Many purple robes carefully walked into the conference room. There was a clear sense of nervousness and excitement on their faces.

“Sit down.”Xia hang pointed at the huge round table in front of him.

This round table was extremely huge, enough to accommodate more than 20 purple robes.

Xia hang also found a seat and sat down, quietly waiting for the arrival of the higher-ups.

After about half an hour, there were faint sounds coming from the darkness.

Xia hang hurriedly stood up and shouted, “Say hello to the higher-ups!”

Many purple robes quickly imitated Xia hang and stood up and shouted, “Say hello to the higher-ups!”

The eight higher-ups did not say a word. Their figures were hidden in the darkness and their real bodies could not be seen at all.

The scene fell into a short period of silence.

A few minutes later, a higher-up said coldly, “This time, we will hold a year-end meeting. This meeting will mainly inform two things.”

“Next year, there will be a martial saint. I believe all of You Already Know.”

“And once the first martial saint is born, there will definitely be a second and third martial saint!”

“At that time, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association will do its best to nurture a new generation of martial saints! and the new generation of martial saints will be chosen from among you.”

Once these words were said, the entire place erupted!

Everyone shouted excitedly, “Many thanks to the high-ranking official!”

“Maintain silence,”Xia Hang said in a deep voice.

Then, the higher-ups hidden in the shadows continued, “The Jingdu martial arts association must maintain its dominance in the martial arts world. No one is allowed to shake it!”

“Although there were some accidents this year, all of this will end next year.”

“Next year will indeed end because your Jingdu martial arts association will be destroyed next year.”

At this moment, a voice came from outside the door! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Everyone’s expressions changed, and they all looked towards the door.

They saw Qin Yu Swagger in.

“Are you in a meeting? Can you bring me along?”Qin Yu sneered.

“Qin Yu? This isn’t a place you can come to. Quickly get out!”A purple-robed person shouted.

Qin Yu ignored him. He glanced around and said, “This is the meeting room of the higher-ups? TSK TSK, where are the eight higher-ups? Why didn’t I see them?”

“The higher-ups are all the incarnations of Darkness. How can you see them!”A purple-robed man berated.

“The incarnations of Darkness? ARE YOU A F * cking primary school student?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse.

The many purple-robed men were extremely furious. Perhaps it was because they had the support of the higher-ups, so they kept cursing Qin Yu.

Qin Yu ignored them. Instead, he glanced at the eight empty seats.

“I heard that your higher-ups like to hide in the dark. No one has seen you before, right?”Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said.

Xia Hang, who was at the side, said somewhat nervously, “Qin Yu, what are you going to do! Hurry up and leave before the higher-ups get angry!”

Qin Yu didn’t pay any attention to him. Instead, he continued, “I’m very curious. Just how ugly do you have to be to not dare to see others? Hiding in the dark every day, aren’t you all curious?”

No one said a word. How could they dare to answer this question.

Qin Yu slowly stood up and sneered, “Since I’m here today, let me unveil your curtain and see what exactly you eight look like!”
