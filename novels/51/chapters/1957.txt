1958 The Masked Woman versus the Ancient Supreme Cultivator!

The two fists collided violently in the void, and a powerful air current surged out in all directions like an avalanche!

Even standing on the city wall tower, one was directly sent flying. If not for the protection of the secret technique, the entire Sky City would have been destroyed!

The moment they came into contact, Qin Yu’s face darkened.

It was because there was clearly a trace of Holy Power hidden in the punch!

No Reversion Void Stage cultivator could resist the Holy Power, and Qin Yu was no exception. His vision was sent flying directly, and Qin Yu coughed out blood non-stop in a sorry state!

The scene seemed to have calmed down for a short while. Everyone stared at this scene and couldn’t help shaking their heads.

“He’s the Si family’s ancient supreme cultivator, after all. Qin Yu can’t fight against him.”

“That’s right. Qin Yu is a little too arrogant to use his true body as a vision.”

“I’m afraid Qin Yu will be smashed into meat paste with one more punch.”

They turned around and saw Qin Yu’s vision become much dimmer and even begin to turn blur.

Not to mention another punch, Qin Yu would probably be killed in a short while.

“Qin Yu, you’ve lost!” Si Shifeng said coldly.

Qin Yu wiped away the blood from the corners of his mouth and replied coldly, “You’ve used the secret treasure and magical artifacts. It’s not your ability”

“Hahaha!” Si Shifeng raised his head and laughed. “What? Aren’t the secret treasures and magical artifacts mine? If you had it, you could have used it too. Unfortunately, you don’t have it!”

Seeing Si Shifeng’s arrogant look, Qin Yu stood up from the ground.

His body was covered in blood with many cracks on it. At the same time, his physical body was also impacted.

“Si Shifeng, it isn’t your power,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“So what if it is, and if it is not? Why? You think you’ve won?”

“I think I’ve won,” Qin Yu grinned and said. “I only lost to your ancestors, not you.”

“The winner is King.” Si Shifeng didn’t care at all.

“I’m going to send you to hell now.”

After saying that, Si Shifeng clenched his fist and attacked again!

Qin Yu looked at Si Shifeng coldly and said, “Do you think you’re the only one with a magical artifact? You’re hiding your Holy Power, you despicable villain!”

“You don’t have a d*mn magical artifact. You should just die here!” Si Shifeng shouted.

Qin Yu didn’t say a thing. He suddenly thought of something and took out a bracelet!

The bracelet was crystal clear and emitted a divine might as it fused with Qin Yu’s vision!

This bracelet was given to him by Xiao Yu. Qin Yu had no idea what kind of power it could unleash!

He had never pulled the string of the bracelet before, but it was different this time. He was facing the Si family’s ancient supreme cultivator, a top-notch existence. Therefore, Qin Yu was not confident!

Soon, the radiance emitted by the bracelet merged with the vision at the back of Qin Yu.

“Buzz!”

The radiance exploded in Qin Yu’s vision, and what followed was actually a change in Qin Yu’s vision!

The vision that was originally formed by Qin Yu’s true body, at this moment, changed its appearance!

Slowly, an incredibly tall woman appeared at the back of Qin Yu. She was wearing a mask, and her internal qi was cold. No one could see her face clearly!

“Who is this? Why have I never seen her before?”

“Does Qin Yu have two visions?”

Si Shifeng laughed heartily and said, “It doesn’t matter what kind of vision you have. I’ll smash you with a punch!”

The huge fist was coming straight for Qin Yu. Qin Yu did not dare to be negligent and quickly activated the vision.

However, to Qin Yu’s surprise, this vision was completely out of his control as if it had lost its connection with the true body! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Eh? How did this happen?” Qin Yu suddenly felt a chill down his spine!

Could it be that this vision had its own consciousness?

Just as the ancient supreme cultivator’s fist was about to hit Qin Yu, the vision behind him made its move.

She raised her crystal-like palm and slowly pressed down on the ancient supreme cultivator.

“Bang!”

A crisp sound rang out, but the terrifying collision that they had expected did not appear. Instead, it was extremely calm!

The ancient supreme cultivator’s fist froze in mid-air, and it actually shattered in just half a second.

Everyone was stunned!

A slap had shattered it? How could it be?

Qin Yu was shocked, too. He looked up at the vision with a face full of shock!

“How is that possible?” Si Shifeng’s expression changed drastically. He activated the life-and-death diagram and hurriedly restored the physical body of the ancient supreme cultivator.

“Qin Yu, what technique did you use?” Si Shifeng angrily glared at Qin Yu as he rebuked him.

“Of course, a technique to kill you!” Qin Yu sneered and said.

“Arrogant!” Si Shifeng was furious. He actually followed what Qin Yu had done and used his vision to activate the Big Dipper Slash!

It was self-evident how terrifying this attack was. It far surpassed the power of Si Shifeng’s true body!

A battle of this scale was no longer a battle between Qin Yu and Si Shifeng, but a battle between magical artifacts and vision!

...

The masked woman remained calm in the face of the Big Dipper Slash. She didn’t use any techniques but just raised her palm and pressed down!

This palm seemed to come from the horizon and stretched for tens of thousands of li. It did not aim at the Big Dipper Slash but at the ancient supreme cultivator’s vision.

“Rumble…”

The palm stretched out and covered the sky and the sun. Then, it pressed down fiercely from top to bottom!

“Boom…”

A loud noise spread out, and everything ceased to exist. As far as the eye could see, it seemed to be a vast expanse of white.

Not to mention the Big Dipper Slash, even the vision of the ancient supreme cultivator was smashed!

The surroundings fell into complete silence. Only when the light faded and the scenery returned to normal was the voice heard.

At a glance, the ancient supreme cultivator had long disappeared, and the vision behind Qin Yu had also disappeared.

The entire battlefield had been reduced to ruins, and only Qin Yu and Si Shifeng remained.

Lying on the ground, Si Shifeng looked like he was in tremendous pain.

...

His internal qi was completely exhausted. Covered in blood, he could not even stand up.

“Thud!”

The bracelet fell to the ground. Qin Yu reached out his hand and was about to catch it, but the bracelet broke in the next second.

Qin Yu frowned slightly, feeling a little reluctant.

This bracelet could only be activated once.

“What a pity,” Qin Yu murmured.

A breeze came from not far away, blowing Qin Yu’s long hair.

On the ground, Si Shifeng was convulsing. He wanted to say something, but he seemed not able.

On the city wall, everyone was even more shocked.

“Qin Yu… He really won!”

What kind of terrifying creature is the vision that he used? Did it really come from the Holy Region?”

Only the Prince of Great Xia remained silent. His face was gloomy, and no one knew what he was thinking.

“Your Highness, did you recognize the origin of that vision?” someone beside him asked in a low voice at this moment.

The Prince of Great Xia smiled bitterly and said, “I’m afraid we’ve all underestimated Qin Yu’s background. That vision… was the one who had destroyed the Immortal Slaying Sect. ”
