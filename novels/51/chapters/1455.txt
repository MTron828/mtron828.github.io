Chapter 1456: Chapter 1,456. First Elder, get out! 1

No matter how Ding Yi struggled, she could not move.

“Qin Yu!”Ding Yi shouted in Qin Yu’s direction.

Qin Yu did not make a sound. She just waved her hand, and a gentle force threw Ding Yi to the side.

Then, Qin Yu ignored Ding Yi. He looked coldly at the heavenly cloud sect and shouted, “First Elder, I came to look for you. Why? Don’t you even have the courage to face me? !”

The first elder naturally couldn’t stand being yelled at like that.

He gritted his teeth and cursed silently, “This little bastard...”

“First Elder, haven’t you been looking for me? Why? Don’t you want to take revenge for Ling Yun?”Qin Yu shouted crazily.

Finally, the first elder couldn’t hold it in any longer.

Without a word, he was about to head out for the fight.

However, the deputy sect master stopped him and shook his head. “First Elder, in your current state, you’re definitely not a match for Qin Yu.”

First Elder said angrily, “Don’t tell me we should just let him make a ruckus at the door! Then where will our Heavenly Cloud Sect’s face Go!”

The deputy sect master said with a faint smile, “It’s just a mere Qin Yu. I’ve long prepared for it.”

After saying that, the void in front of him shook.

Then, a white-robed elder walked out.

He looked like a sage with a gentle expression.

However, there was a trace of viciousness hidden on his seemingly kind face.

“White-robed Daoist, I’ll leave that Qin Yu to you,”said the deputy sect master.

The white-robed Daoist bowed slightly and said, “Please Rest assured, deputy sect master.”

After saying this, the white-robed Daoist was about to leave. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Wait.”But at this moment, the first elder suddenly called out to the white-robed Daoist.

With a thought, a chime bell appeared in his hand.

Upon seeing this chime bell, the deputy sect master could not help but be greatly shocked.

“This chime bell is a genuine void-returning artifact. I will hand it over to you now. You must kill him,”the first elder said coldly.

The white-robed Daoist’s eyes could not help but flicker with a strange light, and his heart was somewhat excited.

He had never expected that the first elder would actually directly take out the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s void-returning artifact!

Although he was excited, he still smiled on the surface and said, “A mere Qin Yu is not worth using the void-returning artifact.”

The first elder said coldly, “I thought the same before, but I’ve suffered at his hands time and time again... Listen well, no matter what, I want you to kill him as soon as possible!”

Seeing this, the white-clothed Daoist immediately kept it.

“Please rest assured, first elder. I’ll definitely kill him,”said the white-clothed Daoist.

After the white-clothed Daoist left, the first elder looked at the deputy sect master and said, “Eighteen Gods, please attack together.”

The deputy sect master said in alarm, “First Elder, is a mere Qin Yu worth us sending out so many hidden forces? If we expose too much of our Heavenly Cloud Sect’s hidden forces, it won’t be a good thing.”

This was also the sect master’s opinion. He didn’t like to reveal too much of his strength.

However, the first Elder’s eyes had long turned red. As long as he could get rid of Qin Yu, he didn’t care no matter how many hidden forces he sent out.

“Do as I say,”the first elder said coldly.

The Deputy Sect Master was silent for a moment before saying, “First Elder, how about this? If the white-robed Daoist can’t kill Qin Yu, we’ll send out the eighteen gods.”

The first elder wanted to say something, but the deputy sect master interrupted him and said with a faint smile, “This is also the sect master’s idea. After all, no one knows how many enemies there are in the dark.”

When the first elder saw this, he could only keep quiet.

Outside the door.

Qin Yu was still shouting loudly, and the person he was scolding was naturally the first elder.

“What? You Coward, are you afraid? If you are afraid, go out and kowtow to me three times. I can spare you!”Qin Yu laughed maniacally.

“Arrogant Brat, you don’t know life from death.”

At this moment, a cold voice was heard from the void.

Before Qin Yu could react, the void in front of him shook!

“Huh?”Qin Yu frowned slightly. A huge hand suddenly appeared in front of him and grabbed at Qin Yu’s chest!

The sharp attack was approaching. At such a close distance, there was nowhere to hide!

“RIP!”

That palm directly tore Qin Yu’s clothes into pieces, and even scratched his skin three times!

Qin Yu hurriedly took three steps back. He lowered his head to look at his chest, and could not help but feel rather shocked.

This palm was actually able to scratch his skin. How capable was this! !

That hand once again withdrew into the void. In the next second, the void in front of Qin Yu actually began to shake rapidly.

Qin Yu did not dare to be negligent. After he shouted loudly, his fist directly smashed into the void in front of him!

But what shocked Qin Yu was that the void was like a ball of cotton. Qin Yu’s fist directly sank into it!

“Clang!”

Before Qin Yu could withdraw his palm, he felt his hand being ruthlessly smashed by a hammer!

Qin Yu hurriedly withdrew his palm and his figure also shot backwards explosively.

It was obvious that this person was an expert in spatial arts.

Although his spatial arts could not compare to He Teng’s, it was not much different.

Qin Yu took a deep breath as his eyes lit up. The desolate God’s eye appeared in his mind.
