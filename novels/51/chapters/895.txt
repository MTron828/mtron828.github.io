Chapter 896: Chapter 896, stepping out of the mystic realm 

Looking at the dark clouds gathering in the sky, Qin Yu hurriedly looked at Li Yu.

“Can this mystic realm withstand the heavenly tribulation?”Qin Yu asked with some worry.

Li Yu said, “Normally, it can withstand it, but there is a gap in this mystic realm that might cause an unforeseen event.”

“Unforeseen event? What does that mean?”Qin Yu asked.

Li Yu said, “The worst possibility is that the gap will become bigger.”

“The gap will become bigger...”Qin Yu could not help but mutter in a low voice.

If the gap became bigger, it meant that the possibility of being discovered would also become bigger.

“Is there any way to stop it?”Qin Yu asked.

Li Yu shook his head and said, “It is still the same saying. Unless it is an almighty realm that can repair this gap, otherwise, don’t even think about it.”

Seeing this, Qin Yu didn’t say anything more.

He could only take things one step at a time.

The dark clouds in the sky grew larger and larger. The scale of the heavenly tribulation this time was beyond imagination.

Generally speaking, the earlier the heavenly tribulation came, the higher one’s talent.

Many people wouldn’t encounter the heavenly tribulation when they became martial grandmasters.

And the scale of the heavenly tribulation was the same. The larger the scale, the higher one’s talent.

“The scale of this heavenly tribulation is probably not much worse than mine,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

This made Qin Yu look at Yan Ruoxue worriedly.

Yan Ruoxue had just started cultivating for three months and hadn’t learned any cultivation techniques.

Could she withstand a heavenly tribulation of this scale?

“Crack!”

Just as Qin Yu was thinking, the first heavenly tribulation descended from the sky!

This heavenly tribulation ruthlessly smashed onto Yan Ruoxue’s body, leaving bloody marks on her snow-white skin!

Seeing this, Qin Yu’s expression instantly changed slightly.

“Kacha!”

Another heavenly tribulation descended. The power of this heavenly tribulation was even stronger. It almost opened up Yan Ruoxue’s skin, revealing her white bones!

But under such circumstances, Yan Ruoxue’s face actually didn’t have the slightest expression.

“It seems that Miss Yan’s endurance is far beyond your imagination.”Li Yu sighed.

Qin Yu could not help but nod his head.

When he first experienced the heavenly tribulation, he was in so much pain that he grimaced in pain.

Yet, Yan Ruoxue’s endurance was actually so high. This could not help but be shocking.

“Compared to the bloodline absorption ceremony, the pain of this heavenly tribulation is probably nothing at all.”Li Yu reminded Qin Yu from the side.

Qin Yu’s face darkened when he heard that.

That’s right, the torture that Yan Ruoxue suffered was probably far beyond this heavenly tribulation.

“Boom!”

Another muffled thunder struck down and almost shattered the ground!

This was also the last heavenly tribulation. As the heavenly tribulation disappeared, the internal Qi on Yan Ruoxue’s body began to withdraw.

Her body was also recovering rapidly. In a short moment, Yan Ruoxue’s skin had recovered to its original state. It was even more delicate, and her skin was really smooth.

Yan Ruoxue slowly opened her eyes. Her eyes were like autumn water as she looked at Qin Yu.

Yan Ruoxue, who was originally high and mighty, now had an even more extraordinary temperament.

She was like a lotus flower that people could not bear to touch.

“Ruoxue, how do you feel?”Qin Yu asked.

Yan Ruoxue looked at her body and smiled, “Very good.”

Hearing this, Qin Yue felt relieved.

In the following days, Qin Yu continued his closed-door cultivation.

He continued to absorb yin heart and internal Qi/spiritual energy, trying to improve his aura. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

However, for some reason, Qin Yu’s heart could not calm down.

This also caused Qin Yu’s speed to become extremely slow.

“What’s Wrong?”Yan Ruoxue seemed to have noticed something strange about Qin Yu.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “I’ve been in this mystic realm for three months. I keep feeling that... something might have happened outside.”

“You want to go out?”Yan Ruoxue asked.

Qin Yu grunted, but then shook his head and said, “Of course, I can only think about it.”

“TSK TSK.”At this moment, Li Yu couldn’t help but roll his eyes at Qin Yu.

“In your current state, there’s no point in continuing to cultivate. How about this, I’ll go out and take a look for you,”Li Yu said.

Qin Yu raised his brows and looked at Li Yu in surprise.

“You’re going out?”Qin Yu’s eyes were filled with doubt.

Li Yu ignored Qin Yu’s gaze and continued, “I’m a Mystic Realm Master. Comparatively speaking, it’s safer.”

“And even if they discover me, it can’t prove anything.”

Qin Yu touched his chin and nodded, “That makes sense.”

“But I have a condition.”At this time, Li Yu suddenly said.

Qin Yu immediately nodded and said, “You say, if I can do it, I will not hesitate to die.”

A trace of viciousness flashed in Li Yu’s eyes.

He looked at Qin Yu and said coldly, “I want you to kill my master for me and seize his secret key Treasury!”

As soon as these words were said, Qin Yu immediately turned pale with fright.

“Kill your master? Jiang Nan?”Qin Yu frowned and said.

“That’s right.”Li Yu snorted coldly.

Qin Yu’s eyes were even more puzzled.

Killing his master was a heinous act. Li Yu didn’t look like a ruthless person.

Li Yu seemed to see through Qin Yu’s doubts and sneered, “Don’t be fooled by Jiang Nan’s appearance. He is a sinister and despicable villain! I Can’t wait to eat his flesh and drink his blood!”

Speaking up to this point, Li Yu said coldly, “He asked me to come here also to spy on you so that he can easily betray you at any time. Why? Do you still want to be soft-hearted?”

Qin Yu hurriedly waved his hand and said, “Soft-hearted? You misunderstood. I’m just a little curious. I’ll agree to everything you said.”

Li Yu didn’t say anything more and only warned, “If I don’t come back within three days, it means that I’ve been discovered. I can only leave temporarily and look for an opportunity to come back.”

“Alright, thank you.”Qin Yu cupped his hands towards Li Yu.

Li Yu did not waste any more time. He immediately opened the entrance and left.

At the same time, the thing that Li Yu was most worried about happened.

Under the influence of the heavenly tribulation, the gap in this mystic realm had indeed become bigger.
