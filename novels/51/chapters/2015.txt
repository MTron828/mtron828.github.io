2016 The Yin Yang Sword

Looking coldly at the two elderly men, Qin Yu stepped forward, sneered, and said, “You want to kill and rob, do you? I’m afraid the two of you don’t have the ability!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the internal qi on Qin Yu’s body suddenly erupted, instantly transforming into waves of power that made the two elders of the Chu family feel a surge of pressure.

The expressions of the two elderly men changed slightly. They obviously did not expect Qin Yu’s internal qi to be so powerful!

But soon, their expression resumed to normal. One of the elders stepped forward and mocked, “You’re only at the middle stage of Reversion Void. You don’t have the strength to fight back against the two of us!”

Qin Yu could not be bothered to talk nonsense with them. Right now, he was lacking magical artifacts and spirit coins. They had come at the right time!

Qin Yu’s feet shook, and a golden light immediately erupted from his body!

His Golden Fist shot out, and an endless internal qi swept over. A golden dragon-like radiance headed straight for the two of them!

The terrifying internal qi caused the entire space to become chaotic instantly. Sparks and gravel flew everywhere. Qin Yu’s figure kept stepping forward in this chaotic space. The power contained in his fists was even more powerful!

The two elders of the Chu family were shocked by Qin Yu’s internal qi. The expressions on their faces immediately became even more shocked. Obviously, Qin Yu’s strength exceeded their imagination!

“Attack together.” The two did not dare to be reckless anymore and immediately looked at each other.

After that, they split up and came to Qin Yu’s left and right sides and attacked him together.

One elder held a sword in his hand, and the sword light was dazzling. The other received it with his palm, and the palm wind whistled.

Qin Yu’s expression did not change. He crossed his fists and a powerful golden air current gushed out, blocking the attacks of the two elders.

“This kid indeed has some ability!” one of the elderly men exclaimed.

“But if this continues, he will still be defeated by us in the end!” another elderly man said coldly.

The two elderly men attacked again. Qin Yu was not afraid. He waved his fists, and each punch carried a golden internal qi as he pounced toward the two elderly men like a golden dragon.

In this chaotic space, the three of them passed by each other, and the air was full of murderous internal qi.

The two elders of the Chu family felt Qin Yu’s powerful internal qi, and their expressions changed slightly. They knew the other party was not an ordinary person, and they had to use all their strength to deal with him.

They quickly formed hand seals and chanted. A powerful spiritual power was instantly released, turning into two blazing flames that attacked Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s gaze became solemn. He knew the strength of these two elders was not simple, and he had to deal with them carefully.

His figure flashed, and his spiritual power surged, transforming into a massive golden shield that received the two flames.

“Rumble!”

A loud explosion sounded as the flames exploded. The golden shield also disappeared in an instant. Qin Yu was forced back a few steps by the blazing flames.

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed slightly. Then he sneered and said, “No wonder you dared to kill and rob people. You do have some ability, but unfortunately… You’ve chosen the wrong person!”

After saying that, Qin Yu quickly rushed toward the two elders. His fists flickered with golden light, turning into sharp golden fist shadows that bombarded the two.

The two elders nervously faced Qin Yu’s attack. They quickly formed seals in their hands and released powerful spiritual power again, which turned into streams of water and strong winds that welcomed Qin Yu.

The water current and the strong wind interweaved together, forming a powerful barrier that blocked Qin Yu’s attack.

“Your techniques are not strong enough!” Qin Yu roared, and his fists struck the barrier of water and wind non-stop. Waves of powerful energy were instantly released, breaking the barrier.

The two elders felt the internal qi on Qin Yu’s body getting even stronger. They knew they had to end this battle as soon as possible. Otherwise, the consequences would be unimaginable.

They quickly formed hand seals again and chanted. A powerful spiritual power was instantly released, turning into rays of violent lightning bolts that bombarded Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s gaze turned solemn. He knew this was the final blow of the two elders, and he had to use all his strength to deal with it. His body flashed, turned into a golden whirlwind containing a powerful force, and collided with violent lightning.

“Rumble!”

The attacks of the two elders of the Chu family surged like a tide, but Qin Yu still maintained a calm expression. His fists were already constantly changing into different fist techniques.

Suddenly, Qin Yu shouted and punched out abruptly, directly blasting toward the two elders.

The power of this punch caused the entire space to emit a loud sound. The originally storm-like attacks instantly dissipated, and Qin Yu’s fist momentum became even more violent!

“Ten Thousand Spell Breaking Punch breaks all techniques!” Qin Yu shouted angrily. His fist turned into a ray of golden light and smashed fiercely onto the two elders’ bodies with an unstoppable force.

In an instant, the bodies of the two elders were sent flying violently. Their inner breath instantly stagnated, and blood flowed from the corners of their mouths. Obviously, they had suffered severe injuries!

The two elders were no match for the TennTHousand Spell Breaking Punch. Their hearts trembled, and their expressions turned incredibly ugly!

“How is this possible? He’s clearly only at the middle stage of Reversion Void…” One of the elders gritted his teeth, and a trace of fear flashed across his eyes.

“I’m afraid this kid is hiding his strength!” The other elder seemed to have understood something!

Qin Yu’s gaze was cold. He stepped forward, and the golden internal qi on his body became even more intense, instantly covering the entire space.

“Kid, I know you have some ability. We were blind. Let us go,” one of the elders saw things not going well and immediately began to change his words.

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows, sneered, and said. “Let you go? Do you think it’s possible?”

“Are you going to kill us? This place is not far from the Chu family. If anything happens to us, the Chu family will not let this matter rest!”

“The Chu family?” Qin Yu sneered. “I’m not even afraid of the Si family, why would I be afraid of you?”

The Si family?

The two were stunned, looking at each other, and a hint of fear instantly flashed across their eyes!

“Who exactly are you!” one of the elders hurriedly asked.

“You’d better go down and ask the King of Hell!” Qin Yu said coldly.

As soon as QinYu finished speaking, his figure instantly disappeared from where he was. After that, a golden light tore through the sky and directly smashed toward the two elders!

The expression of the two elders changed drastically. They knew they could no longer escape Qin Yu’s attack and could only fight with all their might!

“Quickly take out your magical artifact to kill this kid!” one of the elders shouted.

The other elder immediately nodded. With a thought, black and white swords appeared in their hands!

It seemed to be some kind of incredible magical artifact. The moment he took it out, the surrounding void began to tremble, and a mysterious and terrifying power surged!

...

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed slightly. Then he whispered to himself, “The Yin Yang Sword?”
