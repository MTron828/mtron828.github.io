Chapter 455: He Teng Came Out Of Seclusion Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The Spiritual Fire seal was a true Divine Rank cultivation technique, and its power was unimaginable!

The difference between heaven, earth, black, and yellow was almost like a horizontal ditch that was hard to cross!

However, for someone like Qin Yu, the consumption of using a Divine Rank cultivation technique was too great.

Even if he used all his strength and borrowed the power of the Divine Dragon, he could only use one Spiritual Fire seal!

As he looked at the Spiritual Fire seal that was coming toward him, a rarely seen serious expression appeared on Meng Wuxiong’s face.

“What is this thing?” Meng Wuxiong exclaimed in shock.

Was this cultivation technique really performed by Qin Yu, who had just entered the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm?

“Rumble...”

The Spiritual Fire seal brought with it an endless amount of power as it crushed toward Meng Wuxiong.

Finally, the two techniques collided at this moment!

The violent roar shook the ground!

Sparks seemed to have exploded in the sky, and it was incomparably resplendent!

“What is that thing?”

“Someone is setting off fireworks?”

“How can fireworks be so big?”

Countless ordinary people raised their heads and looked towards the sky.

Waves of blazing flames surged over!

The small mountain in the distance began to crumble, and the trees turned into ashes in an instant!

Even the Water Rhyme Tower was affected. He Teng, who was sitting cross-legged in the Water Rhyme Tower, suddenly opened his eyes.

“What... What kind of power is this? Could it be that a half-step Martial Marquis is coming?” He Teng’s expression was somewhat unsightly.

“It can’t be a technique that Qin Yu used, can it?” He Teng muttered in a low voice.

Then, he didn’t dare to think too much about it and hurriedly began to break through.

He was only a step away from the half-step Martial Marquis realm. As long as he stepped into the half-step Martial Marquis realm, there was nothing to be afraid of.

...

“Phew!”

The Inner Strength Grandmasters beside Meng Wuxiong couldn’t take it anymore. They vomited blood on the spot and died!

Meng Wuxiong’s expression changed drastically, and a sense of unease arose in his heart!

“This... What on earth is this thing?!” Meng Wuxiong felt a trace of pressure!

The spell that he had cast was actually swallowed at this moment!

An endless power pressed down on Meng Wuxiong.

A heatwave that was like a bomb’s explosion hit his face. Meng Wuxiong felt as if his face was about to be roasted!

“Oh no!” Meng Wuxiong thought to himself. He wanted to run away.

However, it was already too late!

The seemingly huge Spiritual Fire seal in the sky arrived in front of Meng Wuxiong in the blink of an eye.

Then, the Spiritual Fire seal became smaller and smaller. It almost turned into a lotus and landed on Meng Wuxiong’s body.

“Boom!”

At the moment of contact, the Spiritual Fire seal exploded!

The entire ground was blasted apart. A radius of dozens of meters turned into a sea of fire!

Qin Yu took two steps back while coldly looking at the scene in front of him.

His internal qi also began to dissipate and weaken.

“If the Spiritual Fire seal wasn’t able to kill Meng Wuxiong, then I’m afraid I’ll die here.” Qin Yu stared at the sea of fire and said coldly.

The sea of fire burned for an entire half an hour and finally began to dissipate bit by bit.

Qin Yu looked at the sea of fire solemnly and walked towards it step by step.

He saw Meng Wuxiong lying there with his body almost crushed.

Countless bones were turned into powder, and pieces of broken bones were exposed.

“You... you...” Meng Wuxiong raised his hand with difficulty and pointed at Qin Yu.

Seeing Meng Wuxiong’s miserable state, Qin Yu was relieved.

He looked down at Meng Wuxiong and said coldly, “As a Half-step Martial Marquis, you really live up to your reputation.”

Meng Wuxiong opened his mouth and used up all his strength to sneer and say, “He... Mr. He will kill you...”

“Really?” Qin Yu sneered.

“Even if he doesn’t come, I will find him.”

“No need...” Meng Wuxiong looked miserable.

“He’s nearby. When he comes out of seclusion, you will definitely die!”

Qin Yu’s expression changed!

He Teng was nearby?

He looked around vigilantly and quickly released his divine sense to find He Teng’s figure.

Unfortunately, Qin Yu couldn’t find He Teng’s position.

“Wait for your death... Mr. He is about to step into the half-step Martial Marquis realm... Hahahaha!” Meng Wuxiong grinned.

“Half-step Martial Marquis Realm?!” Qin Yu’s expression changed again!

In just a few days, He Teng was actually about to step into the half-step Martial Marquis Realm?!

What kind of method was this?! How could his cultivation speed be so fast?!

“Tell me, what secret are you hiding?!” Qin Yu grabbed Meng Wuxiong’s chest and asked angrily.

Meng Wuxiong sneered. “I won’t tell you... Qin Yu, I’ll wait for you in h*ll!”

After saying that, Meng Wuxiong’s eyes widened, and his internal qi quickly disappeared.

Qin Yu’s expression turned solemn.

There was no doubt He Teng and Meng Wuxiong must have used some secret technique or treasure to cultivate so quickly.

However... Was it a secret technique or a treasure? If it was a treasure, then where was it?

“Boom!”

Just as Qin Yu was deep in thought, a terrifying internal qi suddenly erupted from the tower in the distance!

This internal qi was extremely powerful, even stronger than Meng Wuxiong’s!

“A true half-step Martial Marquis?!” Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

He looked in the direction of the Water Rhyme Tower and said in a low voice, “Could it be... He Teng is hiding there?”

Qin Yu didn’t dare to think too much about it. In his current state, he had no way to fight back against He Teng.

What he needed to do now was to avoid him!

Thus, Qin Yu didn’t waste any more time. He left quickly.

...

Inside the Water Rhyme Tower, streams of powerful internal qi surrounded He Teng’s body.

He revealed a crazed expression and laughed creepily. “Is this the half-step Martial Marquis... is this the half-step Martial Marquis?! In this world, is there anything that I, He Teng, can’t do?!”

Feeling the power of the half-step Martial Marquis realm, He Teng was extremely excited!

“It’s time to kill Qin Yu.” He Teng’s eyes narrowed, and with a stomp of his feet, his figure quickly disappeared.

In a moment, he landed in the ruins of the Meng family manor.

As he looked at this scene, He Teng couldn’t help but say in a cold voice, “They used the mountain protection artifact to fight to such an extent... Qin Yu, you’re dead meat!”

The stronger Qin Yu was, the angrier He Teng became!

Because that was the power that belonged to He Teng! The power of the Divine Dragon belonged to He Teng!

But at the critical moment, it was snatched away by Qin Yu. How could he not be angry?!

“If I was the one who obtained the power of the Divine Dragon... who in the world could stop me?!” He Teng’s eyes revealed a fierce light, and his body was trembling.

At this moment, He Teng discovered Meng Wuxiong’s corpse lying on the ground.

He Teng frowned slightly. With a flash, he landed beside Meng Wuxiong.

“He’s actually dead?” As he looked at Meng Wuxiong, who had no internal qi, He Teng’s anger increased by several levels.

“Don’t worry. I’ll take revenge for you,” After a long time, He Teng said indifferently.

“I’ll also take this opportunity to tell the world that I, He Teng, have stepped into the half-step Marquis Realm!” He Teng sneered.

In the next second, he left the Meng family manor.

The surroundings fell into silence.

The once glorious Meng family manor was now extremely deserted.

An hour after He Teng left, a figure walked out from the darkness.

This person was none other than Qin Yu!

“Is that the power of a half-step Martial Marquis?” Qin Yu took a deep breath, and a strong desire appeared in his eyes.

Then, Qin Yu raised his head to look at the Water Rhyme Tower in the distance and said in a low voice, “He Teng... relied on that tower to cultivate... ?”

At this point, the smile on Qin Yu’s face became even wider.

“Now, this tower belongs to me!”
