1848 Jue Wu’s Arm

The force of the self-destruction of a Reversion Void Stage cultivator was indeed destructive as if it was going to raze everything in the surroundings to the ground.

The crowd of onlookers quickly scattered to flee in all directions. Those who failed to escape in time were directly blown into a mist of blood.

Qin Yu, being the closest, naturally suffered the most intense impact. However, his body emitted the powerful Golden Light. It was like a ball spreading out and enveloping everything around him with him as the center.

Smoke and dust were everywhere. Nothing could be seen clearly in the golden light.

The crowd who had fled far away looked at this scene with grave expressions.

“I wonder if Qin Yu survived.”

“It’s hard to kill someone in the same cultivation realm by self-destruction.”

Just as they said, Qin Yu, who was in the center, was not severely injured. He only suffered a superficial wound with some blood stains on his body.

Qin Yu could not help but frown.

His self-destruction undoubtedly caused trouble for Qin Yu. At least Qin Yu could not clearly find out about the strength that the Tong family possessed.

Qin Yu then looked up at Li Yingying who was confined.

He stepped forward and stood in front of Li Yingying.

At this moment, Li Yingying was already scared out of her wits. She looked at Qin Yu, and her whole body trembled.

“Qin… Qin Yu, you… Please don’t kill me…” Li Yingying’s body trembled, and tears even flowed from her eyes.

Qin Yu ignored her. He grabbed Li Yingying with one hand and brought her back to Tianyun Sect.

In a dark room, Li Yingying, kneeling in front of Qin Yu, kept begging for mercy.

“As long as you don’t kill me, I’m willing to do anything. I… I can help you find out about the Tong family, and I can be your spy!” Li Yingying thought of all the life-saving methods she could think of.

Qin Yu stood in front of Li Yingying and said, “Where’s Jue Wu?”

As Li Yingying was already scared out of her wits at this moment, she didn’t dare to hide anything.

She told Qin Yu what had happened.

Qin Yu couldn’t help frowning after hearing the story.

“The Tong family took Jue Wu away at this time?” Qin Yu was confused.

Could it be that he had been exposed?

That shouldn’t be the case. Although Qin Yu did let someone go off on his way, he couldn’t possibly bring the news back to the Tong family so quickly with his ability.

“Let me ask you, is there a True Saint in the Tong family?” Qin Yu asked.

Li Yingying quickly shook her head and said, “I don’t know about this. I’m just a tool in the eyes of the Tong family. Why would they tell me this…”

“So, you know you’re just a tool?” Qin Yu sneered.

Li Yingying opened her mouth but didn’t dare to say anything.

“It seems that there’s no use in keeping you alive.” Qin Yu stood up slowly and emanated a killing intent.

This made Li Yingying, who was already nervous, so scared that she peed her pants.

Looking at the yellowish puddle on the ground, a trace of disgust flashed across Qin Yu’s face.

“I have more information!” At this moment, Li Yingying seemed to have thought of something.

She grabbed Qin Yu’s pant leg and said anxiously, “The Tong family once had a True Saint. And this True Saint has brought the Tong family its current prosperity!”

“A True Saint? What kind of information is this?” Qin Yu frowned.

It was not unusual for the Tong family, a second-rate aristocratic family, to have a True Saint.

The most important thing was whether the Tong family still had a True Saint keeping watch.

If there was, Qin Yu’s presence would be equivalent to suicide.

“Forget it. I’ll go and find out the information myself.” Qin Yu waved his hand. He did not want to waste any more time with Li Yingying.

Li Yingying opened her mouth to beg for mercy, but Qin Yu raised her finger and pointed it at her lower abdomen.

In that instant, Li Yingying felt unbearable pain in her stomach, and the true energy in her body rapidly dissipated.

“You… You destroyed my cultivation?” Li Yingying raised her head and looked at Qin Yu with anger and fear.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “If I let you die like this, wouldn’t that be too easy on you? How you treated Jue Wu, I will return it to you ten times or a hundred times more.”

“Qin Yu, you vicious b*stard!” Li Yingying was on the verge of a mental breakdown. Her hair was disheveled as she roared madly.

However, Qin Yu ignored her. He picked Li Yingying up with one hand and walked out of Tianyun Sect.

Just then, Zhuo Jing’s old friend walked in.

Looking at the scene in front of him, he said in surprise, “Qin Yu, what are you…”

“You came just in time. I’ll leave Li Yingying to you.” Qin Yu threw Li Yingying in front of him.

“Send her to the largest brothel in Nanzhou and make sure she can never leave the place.”

“No problem,” the young man smiled and said. “It’s a small matter.”

After saying that, he grabbed Li Yingying and turned around to walk out of the sect.

The news of Qin Yu’s battle with several Reversion Void Stage cultivators of the Tong family spread like wildfire.

His terrifying strength shocked everyone.

“Qin Yu killed the Reversion Void Stage cultivators as easily as chopping vegetables!”

“The Reversion Void Stage cultivators from the Tong family were totally defenseless against Qin Yu.”

“Qin Yu’s strength seems not inferior to the Xiao brothers.”

“It was not Xiao Sheng that returned but Qin Yu.”

The crowd discussed spiritedly, but no one dared to come and pledge their allegiance.

There was no other reason than the Tong family behind them.

It was an aristocratic family in Zhongzhou. How could it tolerate this?

…

At the Tong family, as Tong Guangqing was listening to his subordinate’s report, his expression grew livid. In the end, he slammed the table and got up.

“Qin Yu killed nearly ten Reversion Void Stage cultivators from my Tong family. That d*mned b*stard!” Tong Guangqing gritted his teeth, and the anger on his face made people shiver.

“Young Master, he said, he… He’ll come to the Tong family to settle the score with you soon,” the subordinate said in a trembling voice. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Tong Guangqing’s eyes narrowed and he sneered.

“He’s just a Reversion Void Stage cultivator, and he’s so presumptuous in my Tong family? Isn’t he courting death?” Tong Guangqing sneered.

At this moment, Uncle Guan walked over.

“This Qin Yu obviously wants to take revenge for Jue Wu,” Uncle Guan said.

“That’s right. I’d like to see how he comes to the Tong family,” Tong Guangqing nodded slightly and said.

Uncle Guan looked at the person beside him and said, “Bring Jue Wu here.”

“Yes.”

A few people brought the dying Jue Wu to them in a short while.

Uncle Guan looked at Jue Wu. He lifted his finger slightly and a light flashed across Jue Wu’s right arm.

“Pfft!”

Jue Wu’s right arm was instantly cut off by this light, and blood gushed out!

“Give this arm to Qin Yu. Tell him that if he doesn’t want Jue Wu to die, he should come to the Tong family. If he doesn’t come, the next thing he sees will be Jue Wu’s corpse!” Uncle Guan said coldly.

“Yes.” His subordinate picked up Jue Wu’s arm, turned around, and walked out.
