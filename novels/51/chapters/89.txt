Yan Ruoxue’s stubbornness made Yan Yongxiu sigh.

Of course, he knew that the reason why Yan Ruoxue didn’t want to leave was because of that young man called Qin Yu. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

But now that this incident had happened, Yan Yongxiu was worried about letting Yan Ruoxue stay in Jiangcheng by herself.

“Ruoxue, you have to go back this time.” Yan Yongxiu took a deep breath.

“In addition, your grandfather also agreed,” Yan Yongxiu said in a low voice.

Hearing these words, Yan Ruoxue immediately showed astonishment. For a moment, she fell into silence.

Yan Ruoxue could refuse to listen to anyone but Old Mister Yan.

“You know that the person your grandfather dotes on the most is you. If you don’t leave, your grandfather will come to Jiangcheng. It’s up to you.” Yan Yongxiu shook his head.

Yan Ruoxue immediately frowned.

Old Mister Yan was old and hadn’t left Jingdu for many years.

Yan Ruoxue absolutely couldn’t let her grandfather travel to Jiangcheng from afar because of her own personal reasons.

“Give me three days.” Yan Ruoxue took a deep breath and said.

When he heard this, a smile immediately appeared on Yan Yongxiu’s face.

“Good, good. Of course, no problem.” Yan Yongxiu nodded repeatedly.

“I have another condition.” At this moment, Yan Ruoxue continued.

Yan Yongxiu hurriedly nodded and said, “You say, I will try my best to promise you.”

“You must guarantee Qin Yu’s safety.” Yan Ruoxue’s tone was firm.

“Also, those few bodyguards must continue to stay by Qin Yu’s side.”

Yan Yongxiu had mixed feelings.

During this short period of time, Yan Ruoxue seemed to have become a completely different person. For a moment, Yan Yongxiu felt that it was a little astonishing.

“It won’t take too long.” At this moment, Yan Ruoxue suddenly smiled.

“At most one year. After one year, I believe that he will no longer need the protection of the Yan family.”

Yan Ruoxue’s tone was both firm and even carried a trace of happiness.

Even her face had a happy and expectant smile.

Yan Yongxiu was even more surprised.

What kind of young man was Yan Ruoxue so optimistic about?

“One year...” Yan Yongxiu felt skeptical deep inside.

He doubted Yan Ruoxue’s judgment.

How much could a young man with nothing grow in a short year?

Even if he was a genius, it was impossible for him to become like Yan Ruoxue expected him to.

“I promise you.” Yan Yongxiu didn’t say anything in the end.

Then, Yan Yongxiu brought Yan Ruoxue to the hotel.

After Yan Ruoxue fell asleep, Yan Yongxiu strode out of the hotel.

“President Yan, where are we going now?” The two bodyguards beside him asked.

Yan Yongxiu’s expression was cold as he said indifferently, “I want to see this young man called Qin Yu.”

“I really want to know what kind of man was able to capture my daughter’s heart.” Yan Yongxiu lit a cigar and blew out a smoke ring.

“Yes, President Yan.” The two bodyguards nodded, then the car sped towards Qin Yu’s residence.

With the power of the Yan family, finding a person was a matter of minutes.

In the car, Yan Yongxiu looked out of the window with worry.

It was Old Mister Yan’s idea to come to Jiangcheng to see Qin Yu.

In Yan Yongxiu’s eyes, the prideful and haughty Yan Ruoxue would probably return to Jingdu very soon. It was absolutely impossible for her to take a fancy to an ordinary youth from Jiangcheng.

There were countless outstanding talents in Jingdu. Yan Ruoxue didn’t take a fancy to any of them, so how could she take a fancy to a person from Jiangcheng who had nothing?

But from the looks of it... things were clearly completely different from what Yan Yongxiu had expected.

“I’m looking forward to meeting this young man more and more.”

At this moment, Qin Yu was tossing and turning on the bed in the hotel, but was unable to fall asleep no matter how hard he tried.

He had a bad premonition in his heart, and... after seeing how powerful the Yan family was, Qin Yu was even more invigorated.

The power displayed by the Yan family was far beyond Qin Yu’s imagination! It even made Qin Yu feel a trace of helplessness!

However, for Qin Yu, even if there were thousands of obstacles ahead, he would never give up.

As long as he could be with Yan Ruoxue, Qin Yu was willing to give up everything.

“D*mn it!” Qin Yu suddenly sat up from the bed.

It was impossible for him to sleep!

Qin Yu stood up and looked at the scenery outside the window. He couldn’t help but clench his fists.

“At most one year, at most one year. I will definitely venture into Jingdu. I will definitely be with Yan Ruoxue openly!” Qin Yu said these words through gritted teeth.

At this moment, Qin Yu saw a Rolls-royce car slowly drive past downstairs.

Then, the car steadily parked downstairs.

A middle-aged man got out of the car.

“Yan... Yan Ruoxue’s father?” Qin Yu’s expression changed.

“What is he doing here? Is he looking for me?” Qin Yu was somewhat confused.

But regardless of whether Yan Yongxiu was looking for him, he had to be prepared.

Therefore, Qin Yu tidied up the room and brewed coffee. Then, he sat in the room and waited quietly.

Soon, the sound of leather shoes hitting the ground came from outside the door.
