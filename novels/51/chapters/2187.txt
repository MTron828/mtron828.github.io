2188 The Clash of the Dao Techniques!

Qin Yu opened his eyes and stared at the light of the dao technique hovering above his head. He felt a vast and boundless power emerge from it, like the light of the sun shining on his body and soul.

At this moment, there was neither sadness nor joy on Qin Yu‚Äôs face. The state of his mind became profoundly serene and spotless as if he had transformed.

There was no emotion in his eye expression. The only thing that could be felt was his incredibly formidable internal qi!

Qin Yu‚Äôs state of mind had reached a transcendent state. He was without any emotion deep down. Despite the formidable internal qi emanating from the light of the dao technique hovering above his head, Qin Yu maintained a state of deep calmness and tranquility.

He did not indulge in self-conceit over his achievements nor become complacent due to his immense power.

Qin Yu slowly looked toward Wu Ji, who was not far away. At this moment, Wu Ji‚Äôs figure gradually materialized, and the layer of thin mist on his face began to disappear.

At the same time, the scenery behind Qin Yu began to change drastically as if it was incompatible with this world!

That was the manifestation of his unique dao technique, while the world before him was Wu Ji‚Äôs.

The world behind Qin Yu condensed endless dao technique. The originally vast and boundless background gradually became intricate and complex, and a vast starry sky appeared. Countless twinkling stars emitted a mesmerizing light like a dazzling painting scroll spreading behind Qin Yu.

In the starry sky, the stars shone with various colors and light. Some were as bright as diamonds, emitting dazzling white light. Some were red, blue, green, and other brilliant colors, forming beautiful nebulae and star clusters.

This starry sky was different from the universe in the eyes of ordinary people. It was the manifestation of Qin Yu‚Äôs unique dao technique. It was the passageway connecting him to the universe, displaying his understanding and comprehension of the mysteries of the universe.

Some mysterious and ancient symbols and patterns even appeared in the starry sky. With the dazzling stars as background, these symbols and patterns merged to form an immensely profound sense of beauty.

After that, scenes that could only be found in the boundless mythological worlds appeared in that world. There were divine beasts galloping and celestial palaces appearing.

Following Qin Yu‚Äôs deep comprehension and the condensation of the dao technique, the world behind him became even more spectacular, displaying a mythical wonder.

At the edge of the starry sky, a towering mountain range rose from the ground. This mountain range towered into the clouds, with peaks overlapping each other, which were surrounded by clouds like bridges leading to paradise.

On the mountain range, there were many strange peaks and rocks. Every peak was inlaid with a bright gem, emitting a mysterious and dazzling light. These gemstones represented different elements and powers, such as fire, water, earth, wind, and so on, forming a perfect balance and harmony.

A clear wide river flowed slowly at the foot of the mountain. The river flowing through the valley emitted a colorful light, and the forest brought vitality and liveliness to the earth. Various magical creatures were residing in the river. They fused with the river with their natural rhythm and became a part of this world!

At this moment, a gigantic sharp blade appeared in the world behind Qin Yu. The sharp blade rose from the ground with a trace of blood red as it headed straight for the Heavenly Palace!

That was the manifestation of Qin Yu‚Äôs battle intent, showing his invincible battle intent and murderous aura!

As Qin Yu slowly raised his hands, the scenery behind him kept changing. In an instant, terrifying storms appeared!

Wu Ji‚Äôs expression remained calm. A tremendously terrifying world was behind him, too. Or rather, this entire world was a Wu Ji‚Äôs dao technique. And Qin Yu had comprehended his own dao technique from Wu Ji‚Äôs dao technique!

‚ÄúSenior Traceless, I finally understand now. All of this is arising from your guidance.‚Äù Qin Yu suddenly felt a little emotional.

It was not due to the benevolence of the heavenly tribulation, but Wu Ji had changed everything!

It was because Qin Yu had obtained the Traceless Immortal Scripture, and he had countless perceptions and connections with Wu Ji!

When Qin Yu comprehended the dao technique, he already understood everything.

He bowed deeply to Wu Ji to express his respect.

Immediately after, Qin Yu‚Äôs battle intent completely erupted!

‚ÄúSenior Wu Ji, please don‚Äôt hold back,‚Äù Qin Yu said coldly.

Before he could finish his sentence, the two parties clashed again!

This clash was incredibly terrifying. It was almost equivalent to the clash of two worlds! DiiSc√¥ver ùíèùíÜw storiùíÜs on no/ùíó/e()/lbin(.)com

As Qin Yu punched out, the world behind him also followed!

It was the same for Wu Ji. It was the true clash of their dao techniques. It was incredibly terrifying!

The clash between Qin Yu and Wu Ji brought about a terrifying impact. The power of the two worlds erupted at this moment. The shadows of their fists and figures intertwined, forming a grand and spectacular scene.

Wu Ji‚Äôs dao technique condensed into an invisible force field, sweeping over like a torrent of tens of thousands of troops. The internal qi on his body was as steady as a thousand-year-old tree, unfathomable.

Qin Yu displayed the power of his unique dao technique. His fist force was like a thunderclap, carrying a destructive force. And each attack was accompanied by intense energy fluctuations.

Their figures intertwined on the battlefield. Their speed and strength were so fast that it was difficult to capture them. Each of their moves contained boundless intent and power, causing the battlefield to tremble.

The stars flickered behind them as if they were witnessing this peerless battle. Nebulae swirled around, and stars shattered. The entire starry sky seemed to be shining brightly for the battle.

The mountains swayed, and the rivers churned. Everything around them seemed to be affected by their power. The wind blew, the clouds moved, and the earth trembled. All of this formed a magnificent painting scroll.

Qin Yu‚Äôs eyes revealed determination and resolution. He was determined to surpass himself, break through his limits, defeat Wu Ji, and become a true peak expert.

Wu Ji, on the other hand, remained calm and composed. A hint of a smile appeared in his eyes. He saw Qin Yu‚Äôs potential and determination, and he admired his courage and endeavor.

The battle between the two intensified, and their moves became increasingly fierce and ruthless. Every clash brought about a violent impact and the release of energy, causing the entire battlefield to tremble!

As the two of them fought, the worlds behind them began to fight against each other!

The two worlds clashed continuously, triggering endless terrifying scenes!

The mountains and rivers were uprooted, and the strong wind howled as if it had triggered a powerful tsunami!

The towering mountain range began to shake violently, and the jagged peaks shattered into countless pieces. The wind whistled and rolled up the rocks, forming a violent storm.

The river also lost its tranquility. The current was turbulent, raising huge waves. Colorful lights rolled on the surface of the water, forming a gorgeous light screen.

The stars in the starry sky no longer flickered peacefully. They clashed with each other and exploded with powerful energy shockwaves. Nebulas flew everywhere, and star clusters shattered. The entire starry sky fell into chaos.
