2074 The Si Family’s Determination

Xiao Hai and Xiao Sheng were both people with tremendous dao minds. They would never doubt their own path, no matter what they encountered.

Therefore, Qin Yu did not continue.

“By the way, on the way here, I heard about Lord Donghuang. Could that person be you?” Qin Yu suddenly remembered.

Xiao Sheng glanced at Qin Yu and said, “In the era of the dao technique revival, anyone who claims to be a lord is a person without ambition.”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and felt it seemed to make sense.

This was a great era of cultivation. It was indeed meaningless to waste time to become a lord.

Just as the two of them were talking, the ground suddenly shook. Then they saw a dao insect burst out from the ground and head straight for Xiao Sheng and Qin Yu.

Xiao Sheng raised his finger and pointed at it lightly. The dao insect immediately burst out with a tremendously dazzling light. Then it turned into a stream of light and entered Xiao Sheng’s body.

Seeing this, Qin Yu could not help but exclaim, “Is the light after this dao insect died a dao technique?”

“You may think so, or you can associate the light in the dao insect with spirit coins,” Xiao Sheng said.

“Spirit coins?” Qin Yu was stunned. “This thing has the same effect as spirit coins?”

“There are similarities,” Xiao Sheng said.

“When one’s cultivation reaches a certain level, one needs a large number of spirit coins to break through as spirit coins contain the dao technique. But now, all the spirit coins in the Holy Region are in their hands. If you want to attain dao, you must either overthrow them or become a part of them.

“But I can’t do anything now.”

“That’s why you looked for this dao insect?” Qin Yu’s shock was beyond description.

Xiao Sheng did not answer, but it could be considered he admitted to it.

“What is your cultivation level now? You need spirit coins to comprehend the dao?” Qin Yu frowned and said.

Xiao Sheng glanced at Qin Yu and said slowly, “If Semi-Saint can be considered a cultivation realm, I’m at the peak of the Semi-Saint.”

Qin Yu was instantly even more shocked upon hearing this.

Xiao Sheng’s talent was truly terrifying! In such a short time, he had stepped into the Semi-Saint Realm! Moreover, he was at the peak of the Semi-Saint Realm!

In other words, Xiao Sheng was only one step away from the True Saint cultivation realm, which was almost equivalent to Si Liuhe and Yan Guyun!

But of course, Xiao Sheng’s strength would not be as powerful as Si Liuhe’s and Yan Guyun’s. After all, they had lived for a long time and reached the True Saint Realm. Ordinary Semi-Saint could not compare to them.

“You can also try to use dao insect,” Xiao Sheng said.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “I might break through at any time, so I need to go into retreat. I plan to retreat in the Dragon Burial Cave.”

“Dragon Burial Cave?” Xiao Sheng narrowed his eyes. “Someone is hunting you?”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly. “I guess so. Anyway, the Dragon Burial Cave is the safest place for me now.”

Xiao Sheng did not answer. He narrowed his eyes, and no one knew what he was thinking.

A moment later, Xiao Sheng looked at Qin Yu and said in a deep voice, “Since you didn’t go to Thunder Courtyard, it means that you’ve offended more than just the Si family.”

Xiao Sheng’s guess did not surprise Qin Yu. This guy’s reasoning ability was tremendously strong, and Qin Yu had experienced it before.

“If you want to retreat in the Dragon Burial Cave, you’ll probably need some time to get used to it,” Xiao Sheng said.

“I’ve experienced it before,” Qin Yu replied.

“Dragon Burial Cave is even more terrifying now.” Xiao Sheng shook his head.

Being aware of the terrifying pressure in the Dragon Burial Cave, Qin Yu did not say anything. After that, Qin Yu rushed toward the floating Dragon Burial Cave.

…

Meanwhile, the Si family paid an enormous price and finally collaborated with the Jiang family.

The Si family would give the Jiang family the blood essence of the chaotic body, and the Jiang family must lend the supreme bone to the Si family.

Of course, the Jiang family had to be the first to enter the Chaos Grave. The Si family could only borrow the supreme bone to enter the Chaos Grave after the failed attempt by the Jiang family.

A large group of people had gathered at the Chaos Grave.

Those from the various aristocratic families hid themselves, not daring to compete with these two formidable aristocratic families.

The leader of the Si family was Si Shiyue. He looked around coldly, and his aura was incredibly terrifying. It was as if he had the might of the Holy Lord that shocked everyone.

At this moment, the Jiang family had already brought people into the Chaos Grave, ready to explore the fortuitous opportunities inside. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“If the Jiang family obtains the inheritance of Wu Ji, what will you do?” Si Qianjing asked.

Si Shiyue’s expression did not change much, and he said, “Everything is fate. Everything depends on destiny.”

“Even if you can’t obtain Wu Ji’s inheritance, you won’t burn your dao mind because of it?” Si Qianjing sounded surprised.

Si Shiyue’s eyes flashed with determination as he said coldly, “If I, Si Shiyue, want to fight for this world, I’m not afraid of anything. So what if I can’t get the immortal scripture? I can still attain dao by myself!”

As he said this, beams of light appeared behind Si Shiyue’s back. It seemed to be the ultimate manifestation of the dao technique.

Seeing this, Si Qianjing’s eyes were full of admiration and shock!

“With such a firm dao mind, you’ll definitely attain dao in the future. You won’t be weaker than anyone else!” Si Qianjing couldn’t help but praise.

At this moment, a cultivator walked up to Si Shiyue.

He leaned against Si Shiyue’s ear and whispered, “Qin Yu is in Donghuang of Lizhou.”

Si Shiyue’s eyes flashed with a cold light, and then he said coldly, “Kill him!”

“Yes,” the cultivator bowed and said. “Xiao Hai and Jue Wu are also under our surveillance.”

Si Shiyue’s face turned cold, and he said coldly, “Leave no one alive.”

Hearing this, the cultivator could not help but frown.

“Holy Lord, Xiao Hai is incredibly talented. I think we can rope him in. As for that Jue Wu, she has Dean Lei of the Thunder Courtyard backing her…”

“I’ve said it. Kill them!” Si Shiyue’s tone was firm.

“Since my Si family has made the announcement, I won’t spare anyone, nor will I care about anyone or threats.

Hearing Si Shiyue’s words, the cultivator nodded and agreed.

After he left, Ji Qianjing put his hands behind his back and said, “Your younger brother is still in Thunder Courtyard.”

“I’ve sent someone to pick him up,” Si Shiyue said.

Just as the two were talking, light erupted from the Chaos Grave. Then they saw the Jiang family’s group rush out in a tremendously sorry state.

Their bodies were covered in blood and wounds, not in a better condition than Si Liuhe.

“D*mn it! I almost died inside!” Holy Son Jiang cursed softly.
