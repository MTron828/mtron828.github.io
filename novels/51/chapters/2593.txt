Chapter 2594: An Ancient City That Can’t Be Rejected

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

He changed directions a few times, but he still could not find another path.

This storm was as though set up to force them into this small city.

Qin Yu tentatively stretched out his arm. In less than a moment, his arm felt sore and numb.

As Qin Yu withdrew his arm from the gale, a deep wound, revealing bone, appeared on his arm. Qin Yu said with a frown.

“I want to see if I can break through this gale. What are your plans?”

Qin Yu said coldly. The feeling that the spirit gave him was simply unrivaled.

Moreover, this storm seemed to be trying to drive them toward the castle.

All of this was too coincidental. Qin Yu felt that this was not a good thing.

“We’re entering the city. You’ve done enough for us. You don’t have to worry about us anymore. Brother Qin Yu, take good care.”

Shen Qian’s expression was determined. She walked straight to the ancient city.

“Thank you for taking care of us, Brother Qin Yu!”

The others hesitated for a moment before following Shen Qian.

Even with Qin Yu’s physique, a deep wound that could see bones appeared after being scraped by the gale, let alone them. Perhaps a gust of gale could directly take their lives.

Qin Yu no longer hesitated and directly entered this fog-like gale.

He had only used part of the Saint power he had killed Hua Qianje to strengthen his body. He had about half of the Saint power left in reserve. Even if he were in danger, he would have a way to save his life.

However, he could not use the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze and the Seal of Heaven Returning.

While advancing, Qin Yu killed three demonic beasts.

These demonic beasts were tremendously fast, and their bodies were potent. In terms of strength, it was only half of the bear demon.

However, in terms of combat, it was much more intelligent than the previous demonic beasts.

Even for these three demonic beasts, it also made Qin Yu expend a significant effort before killing them.

Looking at the bone spurs that had broken open before his eyes, Qin Yu felt somewhat horrified.

Suddenly, under the ultimate vision of the true vision, he saw a human figure

appear there.

A layer of light appeared around him. The surrounding gales could not invade him in the slightest.

“Young Friend Qin Yu, in short, I am the chosen by Lord Su Xinghe, Tianji. After entering the castle, I need you to rescue a living being from the castle’s dungeon. This is crucial for the progress of the human race in this Saint Kingdom. If we fail, both the current situation and the future of the human race will be jeopardized.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

After the gray-haired old man spoke, his body completely dissipated.

A bow, shimmering with a metallic luster, was left on the spot. Its exterior was shining with a dazzling light. The bow’s body was elegantly curved and adorned with countless exquisite runes. The symbols of the sun, the stars, and the moon were engraved on it.

“F*ck, good bow!”

Although this Elder Tianji, who appeared out of nowhere, stunned Qin Yu.

This bowstring was many times better than the bone spike in his hand. Qin Yu held it directly in his hand, and the position he was holding it was heavy.

This bowstring looked tremendously light, but it had such a terrifying gravity. This made Qin Yu somewhat surprised.

Qin Yu hesitated for a moment but continued to advance.

What a joke. As long as the spirit in the lead was there, wouldn’t it be suicide to go to that castle?

Even if he gave him a bow.

Qin Yu continued walking for nearly an hour. What appeared in front of him made him completely stunned.

An ancient and simple city emerged from the mist, revealing a corner in its hazy atmosphere.

It was the city he had seen before. After advancing for nearly two hours, he returned to the starting point.

“Looks like I can’t escape!”

This eerie scene left Qin Yu completely disheartened.

At the same time, he was deeply shocked by the old man who had appeared out of nowhere. If he was truly the person chosen by Saint Su Xinghe, he should not be hostile to him.

Moreover, he seemed to have predicted that he would enter the castle. This seemed to be similar to a prediction ability.

Could it be that this old man’s ability was the prediction? He might have a seed similar to Hua Qianje and the others.

However, the information he revealed was too limited, leaving no room for speculation. He did not even provide specific details about the being that needed to be rescued. Everything seemed disjointed and confusing.

Qin Yu shook his head and slowly approached the ancient city.

At this moment, he no longer dared to use the eye of true vision again. The spirit seemed to be able to sense his gaze, so he dared not use it again.

Elder Tianji, tremendously far away, suddenly trembled and spat a mouthful of blood.

“Is the backlash of deducing the heavenly secrets so terrifying?”

He shook his head in shock.

“I will do my best, and this is the limit of what I can do. I hope they can find that little chance of survival…

He coughed as he walked deeper in.

Near the ancient city, the demons attacking the west gate occupied a large portion of the area, and the spirit mage was also there.

Qin Yu carefully chose the east gate that was the farthest. After killing a few demons on the way, he finally arrived in front of the castle.

“Stop!”

“He’s not a demon. You can let him come up.”

Another voice sounded from another place.

A basket was lowered from the city wall. Qin Yu stepped on the basket and allowed the soldiers to pull him up.

“Outsider, this city is being attacked by demons. I order you to go to the west gate immediately to help kill the demons.”

The soldier earlier on walked up to him. His physique displayed tight and robust contours outside his leather armor, and Qin Yu could feel a formidable strength from it.

Moreover, his face and shoulders were covered with scars. The densely packed scars looked very ferocious.

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly. From his senses, this person’s physical body should not be as abnormal as that bear demon’s. However, this person’s calm expression could tell his intelligence was not low.

Moreover, at his feet, there was a corpse with half of its head missing.

It was one of the four people that Shen Qian was with. Perhaps they rejected the soldier’s invitation and were killed immediately.

He might be able to kill the soldier in front of him, but there were nearly a hundred soldiers around him, and there was also a person who looked like a

captain less than a hundred meters away from him. He was not confident in dealing with them.

“Alright.’

Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“Bring him to the west gate!”

The soldier said coldly. The other two then “accompanied”‘ Qin Yu to the west gate.

“D*mn it, it’s all these outsiders’ fault. We’ve been fighting against these demons for hundreds of years, and after these outsiders appeared, their strength has actually soared to such a level. If this continues, I’m afraid our Nine Tune City can no longer defend itself.” The captain fiercely spat..
