This was the social status of medical skills.

Qin Yu had two purposes for this trip to the Divine Alchemist Valley.

First, he wanted to find connections and resources to increase his cultivation speed.

Second, he wanted to find a decent instrument to refine medicine.

That day, Qin Yu brought Yao Qing to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The Divine Alchemist Pavilion was located in Qinghe town, which was adjacent to Peach Blossom City.

Although it was just a small town, because of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s existence, there was an endless stream of people heading towards Qinghe town every year.

This also gave Qinghe town’s economy a boost! Every year, it brought Qinghe town a huge amount of income.

Qin Yu and Yao Qing took a plane and soon arrived at the airport near Qinghe town.

Then, the two of them took a taxi to Qinghe town.

Perhaps there were too many people going to Qinghe town, but when Qin Yu and Yao Qing got in the car, there was already someone in the car.

“Isn’t there someone in your car?” Yao Qing couldn’t help but ask.

The driver glanced at Yao Qing and said, “Of course you have to share the car to go to Qinghe town. Otherwise, you will have to wait for a long time.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh. The Divine Alchemist Pavilion was too enticing!

“Mr. Qin, shall we wait or not?” Yao Qing tried to ask.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Get in the car. It’s fine as long as we can sit down.”

Therefore, the two of them squeezed into the car and sat down.

Besides Qin Yu, the other passenger was a young girl around 20 years old.

The young girl had two braided pigtails. She wore a long red dress and there was a small peach blossom tattoo between her eyebrows. She looked like she had come from ancient times.

The young girl didn’t smile. After Qin Yu and Yao Qing got in the car, she turned her head to the side.

Yao Qing sized up the young girl and said with a smile, “Are you also going to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?”

The young girl didn’t say a word. She didn’t even turn her head.

When Yao Qing saw this, not only did he not have the slightest sense of shame, but he became even more enthusiastic.

He bragged, “Do you know who this is? He is an Elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion! His status is extraordinary!”

When he heard Yao Qing’s words, Qin Yu almost spat out a mouthful of water.

The young girl finally turned her face over.

She glanced at Qin Yu and said, “The Divine Alchemist Pavilion doesn’t have such a young Elder.”

“Gee, he’s a prospective Elder.” Yao Qing said cheekily.

The young girl frowned and seemed to be quite disgusted with Yao Qing.

“Stop talking,” Qin Yu said somewhat helplessly.

The airport wasn’t far from the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. After more than an hour, they arrived near the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

The entire building of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion was situated in a Grand Canyon.

The building was built on top of the canyon.

This was also one of the reasons why it was named the Divine Alchemist Valley.

After alighting from the car, the driver stretched out a finger and said, “One thousand.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Why is it so expensive?”

The driver didn’t hide anything and said with a smile, “Which of those who go to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion for treatment aren’t rich? Since you guys are so rich, of course I have to charge a little more.”

“You!” Yao Qing was flustered and was about to retort when Qin Yu waved his hand and interrupted, “Forget it. Let’s pay up.”

Although Yao Qing was somewhat unwilling, he still obediently gave the money to the driver.

Then, the group of three walked towards the Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s main door.

The main door was transformed from natural boulders and there was already a long line at the huge door.

There were two young pharmacists in charge of guarding the door.

“Are you here to see a doctor? Tell me. I can diagnose diseases!” Yao Qing turned around and said with a smile as he stared at the young girl.

The young girl glanced at Yao Qing coldly and said, “You’re a grown man, yet you blabber so much nonsense!”

Yao Qing’s face flushed and he appeared embarrassed.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh. Was this still the white-haired young man who had followed the Shen family in the past? How did he become so thick-skinned?

Most of the people lining up at the Divine Alchemist Pavilion were here to see a doctor.

Of course, there were occasionally some who wanted to join the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

But the Divine Alchemist pavilion’s requirements were extremely high, and they could only recruit up to ten people a year.

In front, a young man who wanted to join the Divine Alchemist Pavilion was mercilessly rejected.

After about two hours, the line finally reached Qin Yu and the others.

The two young pharmacists sized up Qin Yu, but didn’t say a word. They just stood there and chatted.

“Hello?” Qin Yu called out tentatively.

However, the two pharmacists completely ignored Qin Yu.

“Hello, I’m here to apply for the position of pharmacist for the Divine Alchemist Pavilion,” Qin Yu continued.

Unfortunately, the two of them still ignored Qin Yu.

At this moment, the young girl behind him said, “You’re already so old, so don’t you have any awareness?”

Qin Yu was somewhat puzzled and said, “What do you mean?”

The young girl snickered and said, “In this world, it’s difficult to do anything without money.”

Qin Yu suddenly came to a realization.

He didn’t expect that the gift-giving and bribery method had even corroded the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

Qin Yu took out a thousand yuan from his pocket and handed it to the two pharmacists. He said, “I’m here to apply for the position of pharmacist.”

The pharmacist looked at the money in Qin Yu’s hand and couldn’t help but sneer. “With this meager amount of money?”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Then how much do you want?”

“At least 100,000 yuan.” The two people said indifferently.

Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed.

100,000 yuan? Wasn’t this highway robbery?

“Which one of those who come here to see a doctor isn’t terminally ill? 100,000 yuan is nothing,” the pharmacist snorted lightly.

Displeasure flashed across Qin Yu’s face. He suppressed his anger and said, “I will only give you 1,000 yuan. If you don’t want it, there won’t even be 1,000 yuan.”

The two alchemists immediately sneered and said, “You’re quite tough, huh? Fine, we don’t want it. Don’t even think about stepping through the door of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion!”

“Don’t waste time. You don’t have any money. I’ll give it to them on your behalf,” the girl said coldly.

Qin Yu ignored her. He looked at the alchemists coldly and said, “I know your Elder.”

The two apothecaries finally looked Qin Yu up and down. A hint of caution flashed in their eyes.

The reason they were so cautious was because they had heard that the Elder had invited a young man at the convention.

“What’s your name?” The pharmacist asked tentatively.

“Qin Yu.”

When they heard this name, the two people’s expressions changed. They quickly changed their attitude and said, “So it’s Mr. Qin. I heard the Elder mention you before. I’m really sorry. You can go in now.”

“Then how about this money?” Qin Yu waved the one thousand yuan in his hand.

“Mr. Qin, you’re joking. You’re the Elder’s friend. How can we ask for money?” The two people said with an embarrassed smile.

Qin Yu nodded and didn’t say anything more.

At this time, the girl in red behind Qin Yu snorted coldly and said, “Yet another person who uses connections to get in.”

Qin Yu glanced at her and couldn’t help but think to himself, this girl in the red dress seemed to be quite cocky.

The next one was this girl in the red dress.

She walked in front of the two alchemists and said, “I’m also here to apply for the position of an alchemist.”

Before the two alchemists could say anything, the girl in the red dress opened her palm.

A ball of green spiritual fire jumped in her palm.

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

She actually gave birth to a green spiritual fire? No wonder she was so arrogant.
