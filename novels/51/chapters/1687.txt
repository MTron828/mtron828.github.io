Chapter 1688: Chapter 1,688, Xiao Sheng’s true strength! 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The moment he came up, he was ready to fight! This uncle Jing actually didn’t have the slightest bit of restraint!

“I remember that you’ve never called me Uncle Jing. Back then, you were very arrogant,”uncle Jing said indifferently with his hands behind his back.

The atmosphere became more and more stiff, and the expressions of the people around him also became ugly.

In the dark, there were even countless people watching, waiting for this big battle.

Xiao Sheng was not flustered. A faint smile hung on his face as he sighed, “There are some people who will never be able to make it to the stage. I gave you face, but you should have taken it, Zhao Jing.”

As soon as these words were said, uncle Jing’s expression immediately turned cold.

An extremely intense internal Qi was emitted from his body. This internal Qi actually directly distorted the surrounding space. Those who were close to him felt an extremely oppressive feeling, and they all knelt down in an instant!

This was an expert at the reversion void stage! Any wisp of internal Qi could unleash such terrifying battle prowess!

Xiao Sheng coldly snorted. He raised his jade-like hand and a gentle internal Qi surged over. The oppressive feeling from everyone’s bodies also disappeared.

Zhao Jing placed his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Xiao Sheng, do you know that I have already stepped into the reversion void stage?”

“I do. If you had not stepped into the reversion void stage, I’m afraid that you would be kneeling in front of me right now.”Xiao Sheng was even more merciless!

Zhao Jing said with a cold face, “Do you know how long I have been waiting for this day? I can still clearly see your arrogant face from back then!”

“You didn’t expect this, right? The Wheel of fortune has turned. Now, it’s time for you to pay the price for your arrogance back then!”

As he spoke, the internal Qi on Zhao Jing’s body grew stronger, and the surrounding space continuously distorted. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

With a crisp sound, the space actually directly collapsed!

Everyone couldn’t help but be greatly shocked! A cultivator at the reversion void stage was actually so powerful!

“Is this the reversion void stage…”Qin Yu, who was in the crowd, couldn’t help but frown.

Such a terrifying internal Qi was indeed shocking.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but look at Xiao Sheng and broke out in cold sweat for him.

At this moment, the internal Qi on Xiao Sheng’s body was still extremely calm. He couldn’t feel any emotional fluctuations at all.

However, he stood there like a tall mountain. People had to raise their heads to look at him.

“I’ll give you a chance to live. If you’re willing to kneel down and admit your mistake to me, I think I’ll let you off,”Zhao Jing said indifferently.

“I think asking the sect master of the Tianyun sect to kneel down for me would be a better choice.”

Xiao Sheng’s willow-like eyebrows were slightly raised. His 1.9-meter-tall figure appeared extremely tall in front of Zhao Jing.

He looked down at Zhao Jing and said indifferently, “Are you worthy?”

“Then don’t blame me for being impolite!”

Zhao Jing suddenly attacked. His eagle-claw-like palm directly grabbed toward Xiao Sheng!

A terrifying internal Qi instantly filled the air. A casual palm strike caused the surrounding space to collapse!

Xiao Sheng narrowed his eyes. He raised his slender palm and welcomed the attack.

“Bang!”

An extremely powerful energy erupted from the first collision!

Everyone was forced back. Qin Yu was no exception. He took a few steps back, and his body felt a trace of discomfort!

As for the others, they were naturally in a miserable state. Those who were weak were directly turned into minced meat!

Everyone’s eyes looked at the battlefield in front of them.

They saw that the two of them didn’t move at all, but the ground under their feet had completely shattered.

Zhao jing sneered, “Although this is just a casual palm of mine, it’s definitely not something a mighty realm cultivator can withstand. As expected of you, Xiao Sheng.”

Xiao Sheng said coldly, “There’s no need to talk nonsense. Let’s do it.”

“Alright, then I’ll let you see so for myself!”

Zhao Jing roared, and the clothes on his body instantly exploded, revealing his skinny body!

And an extremely powerful force surged out at this moment. It was like a vast ocean, pouncing towards him!

Within a radius of several hundred meters, no one was unaffected. This strength was truly too terrifying!

Qin Yu’s expression became increasingly ugly. He had never seen Xiao Sheng make a move, so he naturally did not know Xiao Sheng’s strength.

However, he clearly knew in his heart just how big the gap between the reversion void stage and the mighty realm was! It could be said to be the difference between the clouds and the mud!

Zhao Jing said with a slightly proud expression, “This is my true strength. Xiao Sheng, are you afraid?”

Xiao Sheng’s expression was calm. No one could tell what he was thinking.

“I also experienced the reversion void stage back then,”Xiao Sheng said.

He raised his head as if he was recalling the past.

“As expected, the gap between the same realm is still very big,”Xiao Sheng could not help but sigh.

Zhao Jing’s face turned cold and said, “What do you mean?”

Xiao Sheng’s lips curled up into a faint smile as he said, “The weak will always be the weak. Even if you have a higher realm, it will always be difficult for you to ascend to the top.”

“You’re looking down on me!”Zhao Jing immediately flew into a rage as a head of white silver threads danced in the air!

“Xiao Sheng, there’s no use trying to talk your way out of this. You will definitely die here today!”

Xiao Sheng did not say anything. He only slowly took off the white robe on his body.

After that, Xiao Sheng threw the robe aside and turned to look at Zhao Jing.

His expression also began to change at this moment.

His originally gentle and refined posture was swept away. What replaced it was a domineering and murderous aura that ruled the world!

The ice-cold chill caused everyone to involuntarily tremble. The murderous intent in those long and narrow eyes made people shudder!

Seeing this gaze, Zhao Jing’s body could not help but tremble, and he subconsciously took two steps back!

Even though he had already stepped into the reversion void stage, he still felt fear after meeting Xiao Sheng’s gaze at this moment!

This was the shadow that Xiao Sheng had left behind for him back then, and he would never be able to erase it!

Zhao Jing, who was already furious, was even more furious at this moment.

He was not angry at anything else, but at his own fear!

“I have already stepped into the reversion void stage, why should I be afraid of him!”Zhao Jing could not help but say furiously.

Following that, he looked at Xiao Sheng and said, “Putting on an act, there is no place for you in the Southern Region!”

“Is that so?”

Xiao Sheng sighed slightly. In the next second, the internal Qi on his body suddenly exploded!

That feeling was like countless cannonballs detonating on his body at the same time!

A powerful internal Qi, with him as the center, suddenly swept out!

In an instant, violent winds rose in all directions, the heaven and earth shook, and space also began to collapse!

Qin Yu could not help but take a few steps back. If it was not for his strong physical body, he would definitely be injured by this internal Qi!

At this moment, there was no longer a smile on Xiao Sheng’s face. There was only an indescribable coldness.

“This… This is Xiao Sheng’s strength!”Qin Yu could not help but widen his eyes!

This aura was not weaker than the internal Qi of Zhao Jing, who was at the reversion void stage!

Zhao Jing widened his eyes and said in a trembling voice, “Could it be… could it be that you have also stepped into the reversion void stage? !”
