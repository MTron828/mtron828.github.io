Chapter 1438: Chapter 1,438, Exchange Guild 1

That was a place where one could barter for items. Spirit coins wouldn’t work there.

As long as one had a treasure on them, they could exchange for what they wanted.

Moreover, the Exchange Guild had an extremely powerful background. They were able to ensure the safety of others, and it was very rare for them to kill and steal.

This also caused the displacement guild to become more and more popular. Compared to the previous ghost market, the displacement guild was much stronger.

Qin Yu and Zhuo Jing did not waste any time. They set off on the same day and headed to the displacement guild.

On the Divine Hawk’s broad back, Qin Yu sat cross-legged.

He closed his eyes slightly, breathed in and out, and absorbed the surrounding spiritual energy.

This was a desert that had existed for many years, so the spiritual energy here was extremely thin. As a result, Qin Yu’s cultivation was extremely slow, and the amount of spiritual energy he absorbed was pitifully small.

“Brother Qin, it’s better not to waste time. In such an environment, even if you have great abilities, it’s useless,”Zhuo Jing advised.

Qin Yu sighed and said, “Yes, the spiritual energy here is indeed too thin. I really don’t know why the people of the divine capital chose to stay.”

For Qin Yu, if he was in an environment where he could not cultivate for a long time, he would definitely go crazy from holding back.

Zhuo Jing put his hands behind his back and said, “They can’t do anything about it.”

Qin Yu tried to sense the spiritual power in his body. Although his spiritual power had already recovered, with his current state, this bit of spiritual power was simply a drop in the bucket. He was still unable to contend with the Heavenly Cloud sect.

“Brother Zhuo, if I continue to absorb the life qi, can I recover my spiritual power faster?”Qin Yu looked at Zhuo Jing.

Zhuo jing smiled and said, “Of course. If you have the conditions, using the Qi of life to cultivate is better than using the Qi of spirit.”

Qin Yu was slightly surprised and said, “The Qi of life has such an effect?”

“That’s right, but almost no one will use it like this because it’s too wasteful.”Zhuo Jing nodded slightly.

That was true. The Qi of life was so hard to find that it was not worse than any precious treasure.

If he were to cultivate with it, it would indeed be a waste.

Zhuo Jing’s divine eagle was extremely extraordinary. Even the wind chasing colt could not be compared to it.

According to Zhuo Jing, in order not to waste time, he had specially paid a high price to buy this divine eagle.

And this divine eagle could fly for several days without stopping. Its speed was also extremely fast.

After listening to Zhuo Jing’s introduction, Qin Yu also sized up this divine eagle and said, “I’ll go and buy one later.”

“If you like it, I’ll give it to you,”Zhuo Jing said with a smile.

Qin Yu shook his head repeatedly and said, “That won’t do. I’ve already received enough favors from you.”

Zhuo Jing laughed loudly and said, “Brother Qin is too polite. It’s just a divine eagle. It’s not worth mentioning.”

Although that was the case, Qin Yu absolutely couldn’t accept it.

“Oh right, brother Zhuo, does the entire holy region rely on flying exotic beasts to shuttle around?”Qin Yu asked in puzzlement.

Zhuo Jing shook his head. “Of course not. A better method would be to rely on teleportation arrays.”

“Other than that, if you are strong enough, you can travel through the entire holy region freely. Traveling a thousand miles in a day is not a problem. Why would you need to rely on flying beasts?”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. That was true. If one was strong enough, not to mention the holy region, even crossing the galaxy would not be a problem.

After a few days, the two of them finally left the desert.

The moment they left the desert, Qin Yu felt the spiritual energy surging in from all directions.

This spiritual energy was much stronger than the spiritual energy on Earth!

Qin Yu didn’t waste any time. He immediately sat down cross-legged and began to absorb the spiritual energy.

The spiritual energy in the surroundings rushed toward Qin Yu, forming a small vortex around him.

The spiritual energy, which was invisible to the naked eye, could be seen clearly at this moment.

Zhuo Jing said in surprise, “Brother Qin’s cultivation speed is really not ordinary.”

Qin Yu’s body was like a long river that had been dried up for many years. Now that he was suddenly welcomed by the rain, he sucked at it as if he was hungry and thirsty. Naturally, his speed was extremely fast.

Along the way, Qin Yu didn’t get up. His whole body and mind were devoted to cultivation.

Zhuo Jing stood on the Divine Hawk’s huge head. His arms were wrapped around the silver spring as he scanned his surroundings. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

His divine hawk had two eyes, which would easily arouse suspicion and be easily discovered by the people of the Heavenly Cloud sect.

Several days later.

The two of them finally arrived at the replacement guild.

The replacement guild was extremely huge. It was built from an entire mountain range.

The entire place was like a fairyland. There was a dense mist surrounding it, a trickling river, and a god-like stone sculpture.

There was a massive killing array hidden within this mountain range. The killing array was jointly held by the leaders of the displacement guild. If anything unexpected happened, the killing array could be activated at any time.

It was said that the core of this killing array was constructed from four void-level weapons. Its killing intent could be said to be endless. Even a peak-stage almighty would not be able to escape this array.

The two of them landed on the square of the Exchange Guild. Zhuo Jing brought Qin Yu down from the Divine Hawk.

“So this is the Exchange Guild.”Qin Yu activated his desolate divine eye and scanned his surroundings.

The entire exchange guild was packed with people. Qin Yu tried to sense their cultivation levels and discovered that there were many powerful figures here. There was even no lack of peak mighty figures.

As expected, there are countless experts hiding in the southern region, Qin Yu thought to himself.

“Brother Qin, Let’s go,”Zhuo Jing said.
