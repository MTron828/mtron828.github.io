Chapter 1676: Chapter 1,676, under the feet of the dragon corpse Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Their bodies emitted endless holy might.

Strands of holy might almost crushed Qin Yu’s body.

They did not even need to move. Just the internal Qi on their bodies was enough to kill Qin Yu thousands of times!

If Qin Yu did not have a chaotic body, he would have been crushed into meat paste by now!

“F * ck...”Qin Yu cursed in his heart. At this moment, he was completely in despair.

Just as he was about to give up, the venerable fifth mountain above his head suddenly flashed with light.

The Wisps of light covered Qin Yu’s body. In an instant, the oppressive feeling around Qin Yu’s body disappeared without a trace.

The faces of the Saints seemed to show a hint of solemnity as they looked coldly at the small mountain above Qin Yu’s head.

“Weng!”

At this moment, the venerable fifth mountain emitted a ray of light as it headed straight for a true saint!

That true saint’s figure was extremely fast as he quickly dodged.

That Ray of light directly shattered a corner of the dragon burial cave!

Qin Yu was stunned. He seized this opportunity and immediately used the line word formula to shoot towards the direction of the Dragon Corpse!

The Saints followed closely behind. Although they were very wary of the venerable fifth mountain above Qin Yu’s head, they still caught up in the end!

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and glared at the direction of the dragon corpse.

Even if he had to die, he had to die beside the dragon corpse! This was Qin Yu’s idea!

With the support of the line word formula, Qin Yu’s speed was extremely fast, and the light emitted from the venerable fifth mountain became increasingly dense.

The wisps of extremely sacred light caused everything to vanish into thin air. Even True Saints were extremely afraid.

After an unknown period of time, Qin Yu finally came to the side of the dragon corpse.

This dragon corpse was much larger than he had imagined. At a glance, it stretched for thousands of meters!

Just a single head was the size of a small mountain!

Beside the dragon corpse, there were dried bones one after another. These seemed to be the bones of the person who had come to search for the secret.

Qin Yu raised his head to look at this huge and majestic dragon corpse. For a moment, he was extremely shocked!

“Is this the dragon corpse... ?”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice. He was so close to it that Qin Yu was frightened by the terrifying pressure from its body!

It was huge, too huge!

The corpse aura that was emitted from its body was even more suffocating!

Qin Yu turned around and looked behind him. The living beings did not chase after him, which also made Qin Yu slightly relieved.

He did not dare to take down the venerable fifth mountain. If it were not for this mountain, Qin Yu would have become a corpse.

Qin Yu leaned against the dragon corpse and panted slightly.

A cold chill came from his back. This was the temperature of the dragon scales, which could be called extremely cold.

Each scale shone with an ice-cold light. Any one of the scales was incomparably hard.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and stood up from the ground.

He looked up at the huge dragon corpse and couldn’t help but worship it.

“Dragon Corpse...”Qin Yu murmured.

It was so magnificent! Even though it had been dead for many years, the internal Qi on its body was still intimidating!

Qin Yu held back the excitement in his heart. He put his hand on the dragon corpse and felt the internal Qi from the dragon corpse.

“How should I use this big thing?”Qin Yu frowned.

It was rumored that consuming holy blood had a great use. If he could eat a piece of the dragon corpse, the effects would be unimaginable.

Putting aside the fact that Qin Yu could directly break through to the return to void realm, it shouldn’t be a problem for him to at least step into the peak of the Almighty Realm.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu didn’t waste any time. His feet shook and he jumped onto the dragon corpse.

Then, Qin Yu grabbed the scale armor of the dragon corpse and tried to tear it off.

Unfortunately, the scale armor was too hard. Even if Qin Yu used all his strength, he couldn’t tear off a piece.

“What should I do?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

If he couldn’t break the scale armor, Qin Yu wouldn’t be able to get the dragon meat and dragon blood.

Then, Qin Yu took out all the secret treasures on his body and tried to remove the scale armor, but unfortunately, he failed.

“Damn, this thing is too hard.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but clench his teeth.

He raised his hand and used the ten thousand spell breaking punch, but it was still useless on the dragon corpse.

After a while, Qin Yu was out of breath.

He lay on the back of the dragon corpse and sighed, “What’s the origin of this divine dragon...”

Just his corpse Qi alone could produce a true saint realm creature, which was enough to show how terrifying this divine dragon was. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

No one knew what realm it was at.

“Even a divine dragon of this realm has fallen here. What exactly is in this dragon burial cave...”Qin Yu could not help but look into the darkness.

The depths of the dragon burial cave were much larger than he had imagined. Even this dragon corpse was only the tip of the iceberg.

However, Qin Yu did not dare to explore it. He knew very well that he did not dare to activate the desolate divine eye because no one knew if he would accidentally activate any terrifying creature.

The surroundings were dark. At the feet of the dragon corpse, there were several withered bones.

Qin Yu walked in front of the withered bones and bent down to take a piece. He tried to rub it with his hand.

“So Hard.”Qin Yu frowned.

This bone was probably a holy bone.

“How terrifying. Even saints have fallen here,”Qin Yu murmured.

The true Saint realm was a peak existence in the entire holy region. It was an existence that could cross the star field!

A drop of their blood essence could send a corpse thousands of miles away!

But even such a terrifying existence had been reduced to white bone after white bone. Not even his flesh and blood could be seen.

Qin Yu raised his head to look at the dragon corpse and said in a low voice, “Even a true saint died here. Then I...”

How could a mighty realm expert be able to walk out alive?

This gave Qin Yu a bad premonition. Right now, he was unable to obtain the flesh and blood of the dragon corpse, and there were many saints surrounding him outside. It was hard to say whether he could walk out or not.

“Something’s wrong.”At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly sensed that something was wrong.

He bent down and picked up a piece of white bone.

These white bone didn’t seem to have died because of the dragon’s corpse. Instead, they had died here together with the Divine Dragon.

However, their flesh and blood were inferior to the dragon’s corpse, so the dragon’s flesh and blood remained intact while the true saint only had a white bone left.

“What exactly did they go through? Even such a powerful divine dragon died here...”Qin Yu sighed with emotion.

No one knew what had happened during these long years.

As for what secrets were hidden in the Dragon Burial Cave, Qin Yu had no way of knowing.

“That’s right!”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

When he was on Earth, he had obtained the Divine Dragon Power!

It was precisely because he had snatched the divine dragon power that he became enemies with he teng!

If he were to borrow the Divine Dragon Power now, would he be able to form a certain connection with the Divine Dragon? Would he be able to tear off the Divine Dragon’s body?

Thinking of this, Qin Yu was instantly ecstatic!
