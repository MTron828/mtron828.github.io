However, when Qin Yu saw the man’s body in front of him begin to shatter, he felt extremely uncomfortable out of nowhere.

“I’m sorry, child. I wanted to do more. You’ll have to rely on yourself from now

When the last sentence reached Qin Yu’s ears, he only felt her entire soul tremble as if the world was spinning.

He rushed into a black hole and returned at an unbelievable speed.

A level of golden power covered the surface of his divine soul, preventing it from collapsing in this kind of rapid shuttling.

After sailing for an unknown period, Qin Yu’s divine soul once again passed through God’s Space and descended into the Saint’s world.

In the end, his divine soul suddenly pierced through the barrier of the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom. It returned to this world once again.

In an instant, the space where Qin Yu landed emitted an intense storm.

Innumerable holy energy gathered toward him crazily under the absorption of this powerful divine soul.

His skeleton, muscles, organs, and blood vessels slowly took shape. Qin Yu’s body returned to its original state.

When his body returned in an instant, his face was covered in tears.

For some reason, he had a strong feeling that this was the last time he would see his father.

He just sat there and silently cried.

At this moment, his thoughts were in a mess. He did not know how much time had passed before he retracted his chaotic thoughts.

“Father, what exactly happened? I will use my strength to investigate the truth one day.”

Qin Yu’s face was filled with bitterness.

There was too much information. It was difficult for Qin Yu to digest it in a short time.

Why did his divine soul drift to such a distant place? What kind of battlefield was that where his father was in the end?

Why did so many living beings die there? Moreover, the power that Qin Yu sensed at that time…

Even the aura emitted by those remains was not inferior to the power of a Saint.

What kind of cruel battlefield was that? What terrifying enemies did they face to gather such a group of people? Moreover, they had failed in the end.

Hmm?

At this moment, the expressions of the three Holy Consciousness top-notch martial artists fishing by the river suddenly changed.

The young man who had been lying down lazily also stood up abruptly. His face revealed an incredulous expression.

“Did you guys sense it too? What a powerful force! Who entered this place?”

“This energy… Could it be that the Holy Lord of other Saint Kingdom have entered this place?”

The man with the rosacea rubbed his red nose and analyzed with a serious expression.

“It’s possible. Now that the Saint Power in the Ancient Demon Land has been drained. It will take at least ten years to recover. The barrier’s power will weaken during these ten years, so it’s the least price to pay to enter this Saint

Kingdom.”

The old man’s expression was also very ugly.

Recently, countless living beings had entered this place.

The power of these living beings was not enough to threaten them. However, the power just now made the three of them tremble.

It was a power that surpassed the Holy Consciousness and was enough to threaten the three of them.

“This person has entered this Saint Kingdom. His plan must not be simple.

What do you think?”

Killing intent flashed across his face.

“In any case, this Saint Kingdom doesn’t allow any Holy Lord to appear. This is my attitude. This is our Saint Kingdom. Even if the Holy Lord personally comes, he might not be our match.”

The old man said with narrowed eyes.

The remaining young man’s expression flickered. No one knew what he was thinking.

In the Ancient Demon Land, Wu Tian suddenly looked up at the area where Qin Yu had entered.

He furrowed his brows and calculated many times but to no avail. He did not know who had entered this Saint Kingdom.

Qin Yu frowned.

A small broken dagger appeared in his sea of consciousness, but he had no impression of this small dagger.

Could it be that this dagger automatically entered his divine soul when he came back from that area?Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qin Yu was also a little puzzled. He had no impression of it at all.

At this moment, with a flick of his divine sense, the dagger materialized in his hand.

Moreover, it was not in the form of a soul, but directly in the form of a physical body.

“How is this possible?”

One had to know that it could only be in the state of a soul in the sea of consciousness, something similar to an artifact spirit.

However, this dagger could directly materialize. It could only be said that it had an even more heaven-defying power. It could open space and had spatial power.

Qin Yu had never seen such power before.

“Could it be a spatial artifact similar to the Sumeru Ring?”

Qin Yu secretly guessed. However, he did not sense any additional space when he probed his divine sense into it.

“Forget it. I won’t bother about it for now. I’ll study it in the future…”

Qin Yu shook his head. The dagger returned to his divine sense.

Then, the three rays of light seemed to have sensed something and surged toward him at lightning speed.

Those were the three Hearts of Saint Kingdom.

The Order of Reversal, the Vessel, and the Divine Shield. Those were the three Hearts of Saint Kingdom.

These three Hearts of Saint Kingdom were already connected to his divine soul. When Qin Yu’s divine soul was absorbed, these three Hearts of Saint Kingdom had drifted to various parts of the Saint Kingdom.

After sensing Qin Yu’s aura, the three Hearts of Saint Kingdom returned to his body.

Boom!

Just as Qin Yu was letting his imagination run wild, a huge cloud of dust suddenly surged up from his back.

A gigantic hand made of sand had formed behind Qin Yu at some point. It then slapped down at an extremely terrifying speed.

“Get out of the way!”

A figure reprimanded softly. A ghost-like figure flashed in front of Qin Yu.

As a sword aurora lit up, the huge hand in front of him was directly split into two.

However, the sand hand didn’t dissipate.

In the blink of an eye, it condensed into an even larger arm and smashed down on the two of them.

“Holy Spiritual Energy Sword!”

The figure in front of him didn’t seem to notice the huge hand that was about to strike down. The silver sword in her hand danced.

The surrounding holy energy suddenly gathered and turned into a violent Spiritual Energy Sword that rushed to the ground a hundred meters away.

The sword light swam on the ground and then exploded.

An earthen yellow liquid suddenly gushed out.

Qin Yu glanced at it. It was a huge sand monster. He had never seen such a thing before.

“What a powerful force! That force must have reached the Dao Realm. When did such a powerful demonic beast appear in the Demon Sealing Valley? And who are you?”

Qin Yu frowned and asked.

“Little brother, do you have any manners? I saved you just now!”

In front of her was a young girl with a ponytail and a short skirt. At this moment, she was glaring at Qin Yu with her fingers pointing at his nose..
