2257 It’s Too Late!

Qin Yu completely ignored those people who were clamoring. His hand moved and grabbed the Immortal Binding Rope.

Shui Yuan glanced at one of his disciples and said to Qin Yu when that person stepped forward.

“You can try.”

Qin Yu sneered and said.

If he was in another space, he might have used up a lot of chaotic power to activate those moves.

However, it was extremely easy for the inner core of the fire unicorn to activate the fire spiritual power of the continent at the Rire Unicorn Continent now. Therefore, the battle with the Azure Firmament Sect only consumed about 30% of his chaotic power.

Even with so many people, he was not afraid at all.

“Everyone, let’s attack together. Not only does this guy have the divine artifact, boxing gloves refined by Master Suo Lin, but he also has the Immortal Binding Rope from Azure Firmament Sect. If we can get any of them, our strength will definitely increase greatly.”

Nangong Qi said. His eyes moved, and the two disciples of the Mysterious Dark Sect immediately understood and attacked.

One person took the lead with a saber, and almost instantly, the saber aura soared to its peak. Then they swung the sabers and slashed at Qin Yu.

The other person’s speed was not slow either. Taking advantage of the attacks from his fellow disciples, he arrived behind Qin Yu and imprinted his palm on Qin Yu’s back with the surging energy of dead bodies.

“Great, I succeeded!”

A sinister smile appeared on the man’s face.

Qin Yu’s expression did not change. The light on his body spun, and the spiritual power of fire around him flowed through the saber and palm.

The surrounding people only saw a flash of fire, and the two attackers were covered in flames, rolling on the ground and wailing.

Shui Yuan’s expression immediately became extremely ugly. Qin Yu did not look like he had exhausted his spiritual power at all.

At that moment, a few more people secretly attacked, thinking the time was right.

“Go to hell! Leave behind the divine artifact.”

A ghostly figure quietly came to Qin Yu’s side and suddenly slid a dagger toward Qin Yu’s throat.

Qin Yu’s body did not even move. The dagger clanged against his throat but could not penetrate his skin.

The person who launched the sneak attack let out a loud shout. The spiritual energy on the dagger surged and trembled frantically.

“What? Such tough skin?”

His voice was trembling. Seeing Qin Yu’s cold gaze, he wanted to retreat immediately.

An extremely hot living energy covered him, and in an instant, an enormous fireball burned his body.

“Ah!”

The cultivator who launched a sneak attack let out a miserable scream before his body was burnt to black charcoal.

“Forget it. Let him go for now. That divine artifact can draw fire energy. He is like a fish in water on the Fire Unicorn Continent, but once he steps out of Fire Unicorn Continent, hmph!”

Shui Yuan’s face was dark. After hesitating for a long time, he finally spoke.

Although they had gained nothing this time, the power of their biggest rival, the Azure Firmament Sect, had been tremendously reduced. The Mysterious Dark Sect’s strength would significantly increase after taking down this force.

“Master, our Mysterious Dark Sect’s methods are not weaker than Azure Firmament Sect’s. Besides, there are so many cultivators here. Can he overturn the world?”

Nangong Qi said loudly on purpose.

“It’s fine, it’s fine. Since I’ve promised not to attack today, I should keep my promise. My friend, we’ll not attack today, but you have to make a vow through Path of Heaven that you’ll hand over the Immortal Binding Rope that Azure Firmament Sect promised to give us as the price for not attacking. At the same time, you have to give us a tribulation magical artifact.”

Shui Yuan looked at Qin Yu, sighed, and said.

“Or else…” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

He narrowed his eyes, not concealing the threat in his eyes at all.

“Or else what?”

Qin Yu asked with a smile as he stomped his foot.

A stream of red spiritual energy surged into the depths of the ground with the stomp. Then, with a boom, it exploded near Shui Yuan.

A few cultivators of the Mysterious Dark Sect who could not dodge in time were instantly drenched by the energy.

The terrifying high temperature almost melted their bones. A few of them reacted quickly and dodged the disaster.

“Qin Yu, deal with that pervert Nangong Qi for me. He’s the one who caught people.”

The man with the mustache cursed angrily from the Sumeru ring.

Qin Yu’s divine sense transferred into the Semeru ring. At this moment, Jue Wu’s legs were completely broken, and the internal qi of Elder Guai and the man with the mustache was weak, but the three of them were temporarily fine. Wang Feng, on the other hand, had already fallen into a coma and could not wake up no matter how he called him out.

“D*mn it!”

Qin Yu’s pupils slowly turned red as he fixed his gaze on Nangong Qi.

“Bang!”

The air seemed to have been compressed to the extreme and exploded.

An enormous lava fist flew toward Nangong Qi.

“Master, save me!”

Nangong Qi’s face turned pale. The air before the enormous fist was all burnt.

He couldn’t even breathe. The feeling of being on the verge of death made him cry.

“Stop!”

Shui Yuan shouted angrily. He opened a gourd, and a mass of the energy of dead bodies surged out. The energy of the dead bodies seemed boundless, and it turned into a massive palm to block the fire fist.

As the palm and the fist came into contact, the smoke quickly evaporated under the intense fire, and a thick and disgusting stench of corpses suddenly spread out.

Mournful cries resounded throughout the entire realm. The energy of dead bodies contained countless resentful souls, and the cries made one’s scalp go numb.

“Boom!”

The fire fist finally disappeared, and one-third of the energy of dead bodies evaporated.

Shui Yuan revealed a pained expression. The energy of dead bodies was refined from the souls with extremely heavy resentment. This punch directly consumed a huge amount of energy from dead bodies.

“Today, anyone can walk away, but you must die!”

Qin Yu’s voice was as cold as ice.

“Everyone, we will only have a chance if we attack together. Otherwise, once this child escapes, we will never have a chance to seize the divine artifact again.”

Shui Yuan shouted loudly.

The people around them were not fools. They all tacitly kept silent.

Shui Yuan took a deep breath and no longer held back.

The energy of the dead bodies of the gourd surged out and transformed into armor on his body. A giant evil ghost face stared at Qin Yu.

“Bang!”

Shui Yuan arrived before Qin Yu and punched him hard.

“Since you want to die, I’ll fulfill your wish.”

A ferocious expression appeared on his face. In an instant, the two exchanged hundreds of punches.

Even though Qin Yu’s body was tough, his blood and qi surged.

The Palace Master of the Azure Firmament Sect mainly cultivated the Way of Soul, so she had limited control over the cultivation of the physical body’s spiritual energy.

Whereas Qin Yu’s soul had just returned and had become indestructible at this moment.
