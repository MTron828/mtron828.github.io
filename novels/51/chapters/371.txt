Chapter 372: Die Together!! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Following the activation of the fifth level of the Saintly Body Technique, Qin Yu’s body slowly turned from golden yellow to dark gold!

Under the light, it was as if a layer of dark gold was coated!

This wasn’t the first time Qin Yu tried to activate the fifth level of the Saintly Body Technique, but he failed every time. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

He didn’t expect that in such a desperate situation, the fifth level of the Saintly Body Technique was successfully activated!

“Boom!”

The power that Qiao Wu unleashed was actually forcefully pushed back half a step by Qin Yu!

“Ah!!!”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and raised his head to roar furiously. Under the immense pressure, blood began to flow from his seven orifices!

But even so, Qin Yu still didn’t have the intention to give up. Instead, he became stronger and stronger as he fought!

“I promised Ruoxue... no matter what... I must protect Old Mister Yan!!” Qin Yu roared furiously! His strength had actually increased once again!

Old Mister Yan was the most important person to Yan Ruoxue. Even if he had to sacrifice his life, he wouldn’t allow anything to happen to him!

Even Qiao Wu’s expression turned slightly ugly! He had never expected that it would be so difficult to deal with an Inner Strength Past Master!

“I didn’t expect that a mere Inner Strength Past Master would force me to such a state...” Qiao Wu’s expression turned cold.

He circulated his qi energy once more, and the strength of a peak Inner Strength Grandmaster erupted!

As an Inner Strength Grandmaster of the Yan family, Qiao Wu naturally had countless trump cards!

“Qiao Wu, don’t waste any more time. Let’s kill him together!” At this moment, the person beside him suddenly reminded.

Qiao Wu gritted his teeth and shouted, “A mere Inner Strength Past Master is like an ant. There’s no need for three people to make a move!”

“Qiao Wu, don’t forget Mr. Yan’s orders!” The two of them roared furiously.

Qiao Wu’s expression changed slightly.

Even though he was unhappy, he still gritted his teeth and agreed.

The other two didn’t say anything else and their bodies disappeared into thin air. A huge ball of powerful energy condensed in their hands!

As the energy in their hands was thrown out, a huge explosion immediately caused a radius of tens of meters to be flattened! The area was devastated!

Under the combined attacks of the three Inner Strength Grandmasters, Qin Yu finally couldn’t hold on any longer.

The light on his body quickly disappeared, and he fell to the ground with a loud crash.

A huge crater was created on the ground.

Qin Yu was covered in blood and fell to the ground.

Qiao Wu’s expression was ice-cold. He gritted his teeth and said coldly, “No wonder President Yan wants us to kill him. This kid can’t be left alive, or he will definitely bring disaster in the future!”

Qiao Wu’s words received the approval of the other two people.

After all, no one had ever been able to fight people so many levels higher than them.

Qiao Wu took a deep breath and slowly walked to Qin Yu. He said coldly, “Although you’re talented, it’s a pity that you have to die here today.”

After he saying that, a ray of light condensed in Qiao Wu’s palm.

The blazing ray of light headed straight for Qin Yu’s head.

“Wait!”

Just as they were about to take action and kill Qin Yu, a “young man” walked out of the taxi.

This young man walked in front of them with his hands behind his back.

He looked very young, but he had an indescribable sense of maturity.

“Who are you?” Qiao Wu frowned and asked.

Old Mister Yan looked at Qiao Wu coldly and said, “Go back and tell Yan Sihai that control of the Yan family can be handed over to him. Tell him not to target Qin Yu anymore.”

“You’re too insolent!” Qiao Wu said coldly.

Old Mister Yan glanced at him and said coldly, “Qiao Wu, you’re very capable.”

When he heard Old Mister Yan accurately call out his name, Qiao Wu’s expression changed again.

“Who... are you?” Qiao Wu asked cautiously.

“Yan Yunheng,” Old Mister Yan said coldly.

Qiao Wu’s expression changed drastically when he heard this.

“You’re Old Mister Yan? Old Mister Yan has passed away,” Qiao Wu said with a frown.

Yan Yunheng snorted coldly. “Qin Yu saved me and gave me a new body.”

Even though this sounded a little ridiculous, Qiao Wu still didn’t dare to act rashly.

After all, Old Mister Yan had been the top dog of Jingdu for too many years. Even if there was a one in ten thousandth chance, he didn’t dare to take the risk.

Qiao Wu took a deep breath and cupped his hands while saying, “I’m sorry, I can’t confirm your identity. Regarding this matter... I have to ask President Yan.”

Old Mister Yan waved his hand to indicate that he could do whatever he saw fit.

Qiao Wu hurriedly took his phone and walked to the side to call Yan Sihai.

At this time, Yan Sihai was discussing the wedding with Han Meng.

After seeing Qiao Wu’s phone call, Yan Sihai smiled.

“My people called. Qin Yu should be dead by now,” Yan Sihai said indifferently.

Han Meng laughed and said, “It’s such a pity to let him die just like that.”

Yan Sihai didn’t say anything. He pressed the answer button.

Qiao Wu’s voice quickly came from the other end.

“President Yan, a young man just said that he is your father, and he asked me not to bother Qin Yu anymore...” Qiao Wu said carefully.

When he heard this, Yan Sihai’s pupils suddenly dilated!

“He actually succeeded...” Yan Sihai’s expression was a little ugly, and a hint of fear flashed in his heart.

“His behavior and mannerism are indeed very similar to Old Mister Yan,” Qiao Wu continued to say.

“What should we do now?”

Before Yan Sihai could say anything, Old Mister Yan’s voice came from the other end of the phone, “Yan Sihai, control of the Yan family is yours, but I advise you not to go too far.”

Yan Sihai’s expression changed again! Beads of sweat dripped down his forehead!

His tone was extremely similar to Old Mister Yan’s!

Yan Sihai’s mind raced. He gritted his teeth and cursed, “F * ck! No one can stop me!”

Yan Sihai said coldly into the phone, “My father is already dead. Resurrection? Nonsense!”

“Qiao Wu, I order you to kill this person who pretended to be my father!” Yan Sihai said coldly.

After saying this, Yan Sihai directly hung up the phone.

Han Meng was a smart man. He naturally knew what Yan Sihai was thinking.

Therefore, Han Meng gave Yan Sihai a thumbs up and said, “Mr. Yan, you are indeed swift and decisive. A great man has to be ruthless!”

Yan Sihai glanced at Han Meng coldly and said, “He should die for calling himself my dad. Do you understand?”

“Yes, yes. President Yan, you’re right.” Han Meng hurriedly smiled.

On the other side, Qiao Wu held his phone and turned around to walk back to Old Mister Yan’s side.

Old Mister Yan didn’t know what Yan Sihai said. Although he knew that Yan Sihai was ruthless, he didn’t expect that Yan Sihai would be so heartless.

“You can leave now,” Old Mister Yan said coldly.

Qiao Wu took a deep breath and sneered. “President Yan said that you’re just a fake. Old Mister Yan died a long time ago!”

“What?!” Old Mister Yan’s expression changed.

Qiao Wu snorted. “President Yan said that you and Qin Yu should die together!”
