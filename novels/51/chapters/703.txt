Chapter 704: Seizing the Fortunes Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Seizing the fortunes of a city?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but be surprised.

Qin Yu had heard of this technique before.

It was said that some extraordinary people could forcibly seize the fortunes of others and achieve the goal of changing fate.

However, Qin Yu had never heard of someone like Sect Leader Hu, who forcibly seized the fortunes of the entire city!

“Are you guys done chatting?” At this moment, Hu Feng stood not far away and said coldly.

Qin Yu glanced at Hu Feng and said, “You should take me to see your father. You aren’t my match.”

Hu Feng’s pupils constricted and he shouted, “Bullshit! I, Hu Feng, am the number one person in Qing city! You, Qin Yu, are just an empty title!”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh. “Hu Feng, you should go out and take a walk. If you keep hiding in Qing city, it will be easy for your eyes to be limited.”

Hu Feng’s strength wasn’t weak. He had already stepped into the realm of a Martial Marquis.

However, such strength was no longer worth mentioning in front of the current Qin Yu.

“How arrogant. Let’s see what you’ll say after I kill you!” Hu Feng shouted loudly. The internal qi on his body suddenly exploded!

Following that, two round plates of energy appeared on Hu Feng’s hands!

“Go to hell!” Hu Feng roared and pushed his hands forward!

A terrifying internal qi rushed towards Qin Yu’s neck in an instant!

“What a vicious technique.” Qin Yu’s expression turned cold!

Hu Feng actually tried to behead Qin Yu!

The two large plates slashed towards Qin Yu.

At this moment, Qin Yu waved his hand and the golden palm sent the two large plates flying!

Hu Feng’s expression changed. Before he could react, Qin Yu was already in front of him!

“Bang!”

Qin Yu raised his palm and a terrifying force slammed onto Hu Feng’s shoulder!

Under this huge force, Hu Feng fell to his knees! Both his knees were instantly shattered!

“Ah!!!” Hu Feng immediately cried out in pain!

He tried to struggle, but found that he couldn’t break free at all!

The surrounding onlookers were even more shocked!

Hu Feng was actually restrained with just a raise of his hand? What kind of strength was this?

Qin Yu looked at Hu Feng coldly and said, “I have no enmity with you, but you actually want to take my life?”

Hu Feng gritted his teeth and said, “You better let me go, or my father won’t spare you!”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer when he heard that. “Hu Feng, I’ll spare your life on account of your young age. I’ll only break your legs as a lesson.”

After saying that, Qin Yu raised his finger, and two streams of internal qi directly shattered Hu Feng’s thigh!

“Ah!!!”

There was another wave of painful wails! Fresh blood instantly flowed!

Qin Yu said coldly, “Get lost.”

Although Hu Feng felt indignant, he didn’t dare to say anything. He climbed up with difficulty.

Qin Yu didn’t really take this matter to heart. To a Martial Marquis, healing his legs wasn’t a problem at all.

“Mr. Qin, Sect Leader Hu isn’t someone to be trifled with,” Su Qian reminded.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I’m not even afraid of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. Do you think I’m afraid of Sect Leader Hu?”

“That’s true.” Su Qian seemed to be deep in thought.

“However, I’m quite interested in Sect Leader Hu. If he can really seize the fortunes of a city, I really want to meet him,” Qin Yu said nonchalantly.

Su Qian waved her hand and smiled. “This might just be a legend. If he really had this ability, he wouldn’t have stayed in Qing city.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He continued to follow the guidance of the spiritual energy as they walked forward.

After walking for hundreds of meters, the connection became stronger.

Soon, Qin Yu stopped in an empty space.

He looked around and frowned. “It should be around here.”

Then, Qin Yu looked around.

The surroundings were quite empty, and there was nothing unusual.

But that strong feeling couldn’t be erased.

“Strange, it should be here,” Qin Yu said in a low voice while stroking his chin.

Su Qian, who was beside him, was already shocked.

“What’s wrong?” Qin Yu asked.

Su Qian shook his head and said, “Nothing.”

As soon as he said that, the space in front of Qin Yu suddenly rippled like water!

A moment later, a ray of light actually appeared in this space!

After the light faded, a man in brocade clothes walked out from inside.

“It really is here!” Seeing this, Qin Yu was instantly overjoyed!

In other words, Qin Yu’s feeling wasn’t wrong! This was the entrance to the Mystic Realm!

“Su Qian, you brought him here?” The man said coldly.

Su Qian quickly shook her head and said, “Brother Song, he came here by himself.”

The man called Brother Song couldn’t help but sneer and say, “He came here by himself? Su Qian, when did you learn to lie?”

Su Qian was about to explain, but Brother Song ignored Su Qian.

He looked at Qin Yu and said with a nonchalant smile, “Qin Yu, you have made the Hong Yi Sect lose a lot of people.”

Qin Yu sensed the hostility from Brother Song, so he didn’t stand on ceremony.

He said with a smile, “Then you can only blame the people you sent for being too useless.”

Brother Song’s pupils suddenly shrank and he said coldly, “You’re really as arrogant as the legends say!”

A trace of displeasure flashed across Qin Yu’s face, and his eyes narrowed slightly.

He looked at Su Qian and said, “Is this the attitude of the Hong Yi Sect when inviting people? If that’s the case, I think it’s better to forget about it.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and left.

Su Qian hurriedly tried to smooth things over. “Mr. Qin, Brother Song didn’t mean anything by it. He just...”

“There’s no need to say more,” Qin Yu interrupted Su Qian.

“Remember, it was the Hong Yi Sect who invited me, not me who begged the Hong Yi Sect.”

After that, Qin Yu ignored Su Qian and turned around to leave.

Brother Song gritted his teeth, snorted coldly, and turned around to leave. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

After Su Qian struggled for a long time, she finally caught up with Qin Yu.

“Mr. Qin, don’t misunderstand. He can’t represent the Hong Yi Sect,” Su Qian said with a sigh.

Qin Yu glanced at her but didn’t say anything.

“Mr. Qin, don’t be angry. Our leader will definitely send someone else to see you,” Su Qian continued.

Qin Yu wasn’t too interested in this.

He stared at Su Qian and said, “Do you know how to open the Mystic Realm?”

Since Qin Yu already knew how to find the Mystic Realm, as long as he knew how to open it, why would he go to the Hong Yi Sect?

“I don’t know.” Su Qian shook her head helplessly.

“If I knew, I wouldn’t have to wait for someone to come pick us up.”

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but fall into deep thought.

“Looks like I have to think of a way to trick them into telling me the method for coming here,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

It was already late at night, so Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry to leave Qing City.

He and Su Qian temporarily found a place to stay and made other plans.

At night.

Qin Yu stood on the balcony and called Xia Hang.

Once the call was connected, Qin Yu asked, “Xia Hang, do you know how to open the Mystic Realm?”
