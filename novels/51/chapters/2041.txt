Chapter 2042: Run!

The great temptation of the Chaos Grave made everyone reluctant to leave.

Even though they knew the Chaos Grave was full of dangers and they didn’t even have the chance to step in, there was still no lack of bold people.

At this moment, Si Shiyue was sitting cross-legged by the side, adjusting his internal qi.

A few drops of blood essence were impactful on him, and he even looked a little weak.

Due to this, Si Shiyue did not step into the Chaos Grave. Instead, he waited by the side.

Several beams of light shot toward Si Shiyue from the crowd.

They were powerful rogue cultivators from all over the world. They were so powerful that they began to have evil thoughts even when facing the powerful Si family.

At this moment, someone took the lead to stand up and approach Si Shiyue!

“Hand over your blood essence, and I’ll spare your life!”

A thunderous roar startled everyone!

Everyone looked over and saw a cultivator raising his hands to grab Si Shiyue fiercely!

That fierce internal qi was incredibly terrifying. It was tremendously rapid and destructive, leaving traces in the void!

However, sitting there with his legs crossed, Si Shiyue did not move at all. He still closed his eyes and paid no attention to him.

Just as the cultivator was about to get close, Si Shiyue’s body suddenly burst out with dazzling light!

After that, a wave of tremendously hoary and heavy internal qi erupted!

“Boom!”

The moment the cultivator touched Si Shiyue, he was sent flying!

“Hmm?”

Seeing what happened, everyone’s expressions changed drastically!

Si Shiyue seemed to be hiding some top-notch supreme treasure, which was even more valuable than a Saint Weapon!

The wisps of internal qi that emitted just now had severely injured this cultivator!

Everyone looked at each other. Those who had evil thoughts quickly hid in the dark.

At this moment, Si Shiyue slowly opened his eyes.

He looked at the cultivator not far away and said indifferently, “Do you think I’m a fool?”

Before the cultivator could respond, Si Shiyue had already slapped him into meat paste!

The surroundings were silent. No one dared to look into Si Shiyue’s eyes.

Si Shiyue snorted coldly and sat down again.

Qin Yu remained silent. Of course, he knew the Si family would not leave a weak Holy Son outside unattended.

When he looked at the Chaos Grave again, Yan Guyun and the others had already gone deep into the tomb. He could no longer see them.

“Can you detect Yan Guyun and the others?” Qin Yu looked at the man with the mustache and asked.

“No,” the man with the mustache shook his head and said. “The chaotic qi is so dense that my divine sense can’t penetrate it.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“They shouldn’t have met with any mishaps, right?” Qin Yu frowned slightly and asked.

“Most probably not. With their abilities, even if they encounter danger, they can escape,” the man with the mustache said.

“What about us? Isn’t it time to set off?” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“It’s not the time yet,” the man with the mustache shook his head and said. “If we run into them, we’ll be doomed.”

Qin Yu was a little anxious. He was afraid that the Si family would take away the corpse of the chaotic body.

In the blink of an eye, dozens of minutes had passed, but the man with the mustache still showed no signs of moving.

“How long do we have to wait?” Qin Yu could not wait any longer.

The man with the mustache looked at the Chaos Grave with a serious expression and said, “Wait a little longer. Don’t worry. It won’t be easy for them to take the corpse away.”

With that, the man with the mustache raised his finger.

His fingers were constantly searching the void. If one looked carefully, strands of light that were tremendously difficult to detect appeared on his fingers.

These lights were like strings of a zither, extremely mysterious and profound. The expression of the man with the mustache became increasingly solemn.

In just a while, sweat began to appear on his face!

Qin Yu frowned. He obviously knew what the man with the mustache was doing. He was deducing the dao technique to observe the future!

And what he was deducing was naturally the Chaos Grave!

At this moment, the man with the mustache suddenly opened his eyes and stumbled back a few steps. He even spat a mouthful of blood!

“What’s going on?” Qin Yu hurriedly walked forward and held the man with the mustache.

The face of the man with the mustache was ashen. He muttered in a low voice, “My dao technique deduction…has a problem.”

“What do you mean?” Qin Yu hurriedly asked.

The man with the mustache stood up with difficulty. He looked in the direction of the Chaos Grave and said in a low voice, “Before I came, I had once divined for myself. The divination showed that although the process was tremendously horrifying, the outcome was good. However… I can’t see clearly now.”

“Can’t see clearly?” Qin Yu was stunned.

He couldn’t understand the man with the mustache’s level of deduction, so he couldn’t understand what the mustache man meant.

The man with the mustache ignored Qin Yu. He sat cross-legged on the ground and continued to deduce the dao technique.

After a while, the man with the mustache slowly opened his eyes.

...

He took a deep breath and said, “Run.”

“Run? What do you mean?” Qin Yu frowned.

The man with the mustache pointed at the Chaos Grave and said, “No one will succeed today. Everyone is in danger! All of us here have underestimated this Chaos Grave!”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and was about to speak when a loud bang suddenly sounded from the Chaos Grave!

The sound was so loud that it shattered the eardrums of numerous people. Some of the weaker ones even exploded and died on the spot!

Even with Qin Yu’s strength, he could not help but feel panic, and his face turned ashen!

“What happened?”

Instantly, everyone around the Chaos Grave panicked!

Facing this unknown fear, everyone’s expression became tremendously miserable!

“Boom!”

At this moment, another loud bang came from the Chaos Grave!

...

Immediately after, they saw Yan Guyun and the others fleeing frantically!

They ran out with all their might. Their faces no longer had the high and mighty attitude earlier on. Instead, they were full of indescribable fear!

Seeing this scene, everyone panicked even more!

“Even Yan Guyun and the others are escaping. What… What exactly happened!”

“Hurry up… Run!”

Someone cried out in alarm and tried to escape.

However, there were formations in the surroundings. They could not escape at all!

Inside the Chaos Grave, Yan Guyun and the others used their secret techniques to escape to the shore!

Elder Shi, who was slightly slower, was hit by an unknown internal qi. His chest was bleeding non-stop, and his body was rapidly rotting!

Fortunately, at the last second, Elder Shi managed to escape with difficulty.

He looked at the Chaos Grave with lingering fear, and couldn’t conceal the fear on his face.

The injuries on his body were still rotting and spreading, looking shocking.

Elder Shi gritted his teeth.. He reached out his palm and shattered half of his body to stop the rotting of his body!
