2342 Great Battle

Ni Dian stared at Jue Wu in surprise, but soon he shifted his gaze to Qin Yu.

He continuously clapped and struck out, and each strike carried the dense spiritual energy qi of the ninth-grade True Saint.

Qin Yu’s body instantly shattered. The body that he had condensed in a hurry simply could not withstand this kind of vibration.

“The Holy Region’s fifth-grade body tempering of the Path of Heaven is beyond the imagination of you peasants. Even if you reach the ninth grade, in my eyes, you are still nothing.”

Si Dian said disdainfully. Previously, he was besieged by ten True Saints or so from purgatory, but these people could not even hurt him.

Qin Yu looked solemn. As his physical was very weak now, he could not use Suo Lin and the Gale Resistance Boot.

He felt some pressure facing Si Dian now.

“Qin Yu, quickly leave. I agree to hand over all the resources!”

Ji Yue’s face was full of despair. She did not expect the same ninth-grade True Saints to have such a big gap in their comprehension of the Path of Heaven.

The network of contacts the Ji family had built over two Path of Heaven years was as laughable as children’s games.

“Hahaha, looks like you guys have a good relationship. However, if you hand over your Si family’s resources, this kid must also die. No one can save him. You’re unlucky to have a relationship with him.”

Ni Cha revealed a ferocious smile and suddenly slapped a child beside him.

The child’s head drooped, and he instantly stopped moving.

“You’re f*cking courting death!”

Qin Yu was taken aback. He did not expect Si Cha to attack a kid.

“Soul Vortex!”

Behind Qin Yu, a soul vortex suddenly started spinning.

The terrifying suction force directly sucked in the souls of the dozens of people behind him and then violently shattered them.

“This kid’s soul power is formidable. Be more careful.”

Si Dian’s expression was solemn. As soon as the Soul Vortex appeared, he felt his soul becoming unstable.

If he had not used a treasure to stabilize his soul in time, it would probably have been sucked out like the others.

Qin Yu’s killing intent was overflowing. That kid was Ji Yue’s niece.

He had wanted to protect his body earlier on because condensing a body required a vast amount of spiritual energy. At this moment, he directly exploded.

Two streams of the Soul Shattering Golden Radiance slashed at the two. The golden radiance carried a soul-destroying golden qi that instantly caused the two to send shivers down their spines.

“Bright Moon Descends!”

Two beams of moonlight suddenly fell, and the pale yellow power of moonlight enveloped the two, blocking the two streams of Soul Shattering Golden Radiance.

Cold sweat rolled down Si Dian’s forehead. “This kid’s soul is a bit weird. Without the power of the Path of Heaven to refine his Sea of Soul, how could his soul be so strong? Does he have some kind of treasure on him?”

Si Cha frantically sent out signals, asking the top-notch martial artist of the Holy Region to rush over and save them.

“That’s all you can do. In the Holy Region, you only know how to bully the weak, and you do the same here!”

Both of Qin Yu’s legs were broken. He could only rely on the Spiritualization Technique to float in the void.

He closed his eyes, and countless golden lights slowly formed around Si Cha and Si Dian.

“Qin Yu!”

Si Dian roared.

“Our Ni family will definitely not let you off if you dare to kill us!”

Even if they were protected by the moonlight, they could not resist so much Soul Shattering Golden Radiance!

“Whoosh!”

Qin Yu’s expression was indifferent. He completely ignored this fellow’s barking. Countless golden lights instantly pierced down.

The Mystic Moon Mirror suddenly released Jue Wu at the last moment and enveloped the two.

Finally, they managed to save their lives, but at this moment, the two’s conditions were tremendously miserable.

The two high and mighty elders, with blood flowing from seven orifices, were lying on the ground like dead dogs.

“It’s a tribulation magical artifact. The Holy Region does indeed have many magical artifacts.”

The Sumeru qi moved the Mystic Moon Mirror, Ji Yue, and the others into the space. He had sensed countless powerful internal qis rushing over.

“F*ck, these two old farts.”

Jue Wu went up and smashed their heads directly.

“Qin Yu, it’s you. I didn’t expect the geniuses of the Holy Region to be so down and out. Why are you so miserable dealing with these two outdated elders of the Ni family?”

Yao Xi had a mocking smile on his face.

“It’s been so long since we last met, but your mouth is still so smelly. Have you forgotten how you fell under my fist?”

Qin Yu did not even raise his head.

“That was back then. Now I’m already in the ninth-grade realm, but you’re still stuck in the fourth grade. With this kind of strength, you’re just a minor character in the Holy Region.”

Yao Xi stepped forward and looked at Qin Yu with a teasing gaze.

He had not felt this kind of carefree state of mind for a long time since he was defeated at Qin Yu’s hands.

Although Qin Yu’s divine sense was terrifyingly powerful, without the tempering of the Path of Heaven, he would not be significantly stronger no matter what.

The Mystic Moon Mirror in the Sumeru ring vibrated violently, and an old man with a gloomy expression suddenly attacked.

“Since you’ve entered my Sumeru ring, you still want to leave?”

Countless spatial qi formed a spatial cage, directly suppressing the Mystic Moon Mirror within.

“You’re indeed bold. I threw you into the spatial turbulence to spare your life back then. I didn’t expect you to bite the hand that feeds you. You killed two elders of my Ni family and snatched the Mystic Moon Mirror of my Ni family. No one can save you today.”

That old man was one of the people who blasted Qin Yu into the spatial turbulence earlier, the First Elder of the Ni family, Ni Wuxiao.

“D*mn it! Every single member of the Ni family has a mouth like a rooster. They can even turn the dead into the living.”

Qin Yu’s temper flared as veins stood out on their forehead upon hearing this.

“Jue Wu, take the Sumeru ring!”

Qin Yu threw the Sumeru ring to Jue Wu. His body would shatter if he fought now. It was better to give the Sumeru ring to Jue Wu. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Bright Moon Descends!”

The old man activated the Ni family’s immortal scripture, and a strong wind blew in the sky. The dark clouds in the sky were slowly blown away by this strong wind.

A massive moon appeared in the middle of the void. It was the Way of Rules in the Ni family’s immortal scriptures which connected with the power of the moon and channeled it into one’s body.

The phantom of a bright moon appeared in the old man’s eyes, and a terrifying internal qi was drawn into his body.

His body swelled up like a rubber ball, but it returned to its original state in an instant.

He stepped forward and appeared before Qin Yu.

He pushed out his palm without any fancy moves, and a ray of moonlight qi was emitted from his palm.

After that, the qi of moonlight enveloped Qin Yu like a shock wave.

Qin Yu felt a massive star hit his body, and his body instantly shattered, leaving only his spine and skull.

Behind Qin Yu, the endless power of moonlight pierced through the city wall and shot toward an unknown direction.

A beam of golden light shot out almost at the same time, and Qin Yu’s Soul Shattering Golden Radiance slashed toward Ni Wuxiao.
