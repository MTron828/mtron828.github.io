Chapter 2564 Spatial War

“Nonsense. The Gu family has experienced as many battles as your Demon-slaying Peak. How can we not be involved in such a battle?”

With the arrival of the Human Race Watch, the sense of decline caused by overwhelmingly one-sided battles was finally somewhat alleviated.

However, the arrival of the Human Race Watch still did not stop the tremendously inferior position.

Among the monster race, countless monster beasts and the living beings of the various races in the monster territory were like a raven wildfire in the wilderness.

Giant Titan, orcs, dwarves, and various monster race armies frantically attacked the human defense line and kept approaching the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect.

While at the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect, other than Human Race Watch, only several scattered rogue cultivators were rushing over.

“We can’t stop them!”

Qin Yu’s face was ashen as he clenched his fists tightly.

With the arrival of Human Race Watch, he was tremendously nervous.

In just a short while, casualties began to appear even though Human Race Watch was in an orderly formation.

In the face of the endless monster race army, their formation was like a candle in the wind that could be extinguished at any moment.

“Pfft!”

A black shadow pierced through Thunder Swordsman, Zhao Dianguang, and the halberd swung his corpse out.

The long halberd that had gathered power swept out again, instantly sending the few people entangled with him flying.

The five of them rolled on the ground, unable to stand up. They were severely injured by a single attack.

Although these six people were all at the Tribulation Fifth Level, which could be considered top-notch combat strength of the human race, how could they resist a demon king that was stronger than them?

Xiang Yu’s gaze fell on Gu Wanqing’s team.

Aided by the Brilliance of Stars and Moon, Gu Wan Qing and the others were not only healing the injured on a large scale, but they could also create shields to block the powerful attacks. Without them, the casualties would have been several times higher.

Dragon Slaying Sky Piercing!

The long halberd pierced through the clouds like a dragon, and following a sharp whistle, it descended from the sky and cut through the sky, directly landing on the area where Gu Wanqing and the others were.

Gu Wanqing’s face turned ashen. She formed a seal with her left hand and placed it above her head.

Brilliance of Stars and Moon!

All the members of the Gu family channeled their spiritual energy into the seal on Gu Wanqing’s hand.

As the halberd resembling a fiery dragon descended, the ice crystals instantly shattered into nothingness.

Within a single step, his body completely fused into the void. His demonic form moved swiftly, traversing between reality and the void, swiftly shuttling and moving.

In the following moment, he was already behind Yan Ruoxue.

With a palm strike, the claw brought along a terrifying space-time vortex as it struck toward Yan Ruoxue’s back.

“Phew!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Amid the trembling leaves, their positions shifted.

The two were now face to face, both throwing a punch simultaneously.

The spatial power collided violently, and in an instant, the entire space seemed to shatter.

The surrounding people looked over and saw Yan Ruoxue’s and Draco’s bodies shatter into tens of thousands of pieces. The space within a few thousand meters of their palm strikes distorted completely.

The space was scrambled and disrupted into hundreds of thousands of pieces, much like a Rubik’s Cube.

Nearly a hundred Giant Titans with terrifying demonic bodies were swept into the space and instantly cut into tens of thousands of smooth fragments.

“Retreat! Hurry up and retreat!”

In an instant, all the living beings, regardless of human race or monster race, fled out of this area.

“What a terrifying strength! This little girl’s strength is not simple!”

The great monster race Godly Kings exchanged glances and saw the shock in each other’s eyes.

“Whoosh!”

Draco’s body was forced back, and half of his body was cut in half.

He would have been swept into the storm if he had not decisively abandoned this half of his body, which probably was in tens of thousands of pieces now.

He looked at Yan Ruoxue with fear in his eyes. Where did this pervert come from?

Death Godly King had never encountered such a terrifying opponent in a spatial confrontation except when a Saint.

Blood gushed out of his body like a fountain, but he did not feel any anger, only endless fear.

He Teng revealed a strange smile and kicked Draco to the side.

After that, he stomped the air and crashed in front of Yan Ruoxue like a meteorite.

“Ruoxue!”

Qin Yu clenched his fists tightly. He was afraid that Yan Ruoxue could not withstand it.

“Crash!”

As the sound of glass shattering rang out, He Teng’s fist rapidly approached Yan Ruoxue’s body.
