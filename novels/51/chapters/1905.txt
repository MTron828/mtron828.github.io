1906 The Yan Family’s Threshold

“I hope Ruoxue doesn’t mind this ugly face,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Following that, he walked out of the room. Saintess Gu was not too surprised to see his ugly face. In her opinion, this face was suitable to go to the Yan family because it would not attract too much attention and be exposed.

“Saintess Gu, when are we going to the Yan family?” Qin Yu asked.

“I’ve made arrangements for you,” Saintess Gu said with a smile. “You can leave at any time. Upon arriving at the Yan family, tell them I asked you to go.”

“Thank you very much, Saintess Gu,” Qin Yu bowed and said. “I’m leaving now.

“Why are you so anxious? Aren’t you going to wait for me to plant the seed of the Bodhi ancient tree?” Saintess Gu asked.

“There’s no need for that,” Qin Yu shook his head and said.

“Alright,” Saintess Gu said with a smile. “Come to the Cold Moon Palace often when you’re free. You can come and see the growth of the Bodhi ancient tree.”

When Qin Yu opened his mouth and was about to agree, he felt she sounded a little strange. It was as if he was visiting their child.

“Alright,” he said. Qin Yu didn’t say much. After bidding farewell to Saintess Gu, he left the Cold Moon Palace.

After leaving the Cold Moon Palace, Qin Yu planned to find a teleportation formation to go to the Yan family.

However, as soon as he walked out of the Cold Moon Palace, Qin Yu noticed something unusual.

In the dark, there seemed to be some powerful internal qi lurking.

This internal qi covered a radius of several dozen stars. They were extremely aggressive and contained traces of killing intent.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He subconsciously activated his desolate divine eye to look around. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

A few people were indeed hiding in the dark. Each had an extremely powerful internal qi. They were also looking at Qin Yu coldly at this point.

Before Qin Yu could suspect their identities, these people had appeared beside him like ghosts.

Several of them blocked Qin Yu’s way. The powerful aura on their bodies even distorted the surrounding space!

Qin Yu’s face turned cold. He opened his mouth and was about to question them, but he was afraid of exposing his identity. Thus he immediately changed his expression, cupped his hands, and said, “May I ask who you are?”

“Who are you to the Gu family?” one of them asked coldly.

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “I’m Saintess Gu’s servant.”

“Saintess Gu’s servant? As far as I know, the Cold Moon Palace doesn’t have anyone of the opposite sex,” one of them said coldly.

Qin Yu had a bad feeling in his heart. His brain worked quickly, and he laughed. “The head of the Gu family sent me here.”

“Oh? Then when did you come?” they continued to ask.

For fear of being exposed, Qin Yu set the time to the day when Qin Yu and the others arrived at the Cold Moon Palace a few days ago.

They didn’t doubt it too much. Instead, they pointed at the palace and said, “Is Qin Yu in the Cold Moon Palace?”

Upon hearing this, Qin Yu’s expression changed.

As expected, these people were here for him!

“He… is still there,” Qin Yu lied and said.

A few of them didn’t say anything else and were about to leave.

Seeing that, Qin Yu hurriedly stopped them and said, “May I ask why you are looking for Qin Yu? Do you need me to inform him?”

“Don’t ask what you shouldn’t ask. Get lost!” One of them rebuked rudely.

Qin Yu wanted to ask more questions, but they didn’t give him a chance. They quickly disappeared into the darkness.

“Strange.” Qin Yu touched his chin. “I don’t think I’ve offended anyone since I stepped into Zhongzhou…”

At this point, Qin Yu seemed to have thought of something!

His pupils suddenly constricted as he whispered, “Was it Yan Yunfan, or someone sent by Si Shifeng?”

Other than the two, Qin Yu had never offended anyone else!

“Sigh! Forget about him. They can’t find me anyway,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Therefore, Qin Yu didn’t waste time and quickly left.

Zhongzhou was incredibly prosperous. The place nearby the residence of the influential figure was even more prosperous.

The internal qi here was abundant and the place was incomparably noisy. There were all kinds of rare and wondrous medicines.

However, people living nearby didn’t show any interest as if they were already used to it.

On his way to the teleportation formation, Qin Yu sensed a lot of powerful internal qi. There was even the existence of several Semi-Saint.

Naturally, there was no lack of teleportation formation in such a prosperous city. Soon, Qin Yu came to one.

The teleportation formation here was not expensive. It only cost 100 million spirit coins.

Qin Yu hurried to the Yan family by taking the teleportation formation.

The Yan family was a floating mountain range. At first glance, it was tremendously mysterious, like a mirage.

Qin Yu’s teleportation formation landed in a city underneath the Yan family.

He looked up at the Asgard floating above the clouds and stomped his feet, wanting to step into the Yan family with a leap.

But to Qin Yu’s surprise, he could not enter the Yan family with his spiritual power. Standing there, his internal qi seemed to have been suppressed, making him no different from an ordinary person.

“Hmm?” Qin Yu frowned.

He raised his head and looked at the high and mighty Yan family. He couldn’t help but feel troubled.

Without spiritual power, how could he enter the Yan family?

Qin Yu stopped a passerby randomly and asked, “Brother, why can’t we use spiritual power here?”

...

The man glanced at Qin Yu and said, “We are nearby the Yan family. Of course, we can’t use spiritual power here. If someone gets into a conflict here, won’t it affect the Yan family’s cultivation?”

“The Yan family has quite a few problems,” Qin Yu couldn’t help but think to himself.

“In that case, how do I get to the Yan family?” he continued to ask.

The cultivator pointed to a place not far away and said, “There are stone stairways there. Climb the stairways if you want to go, but I would advise you not to do so. Many people want to go to the Yan family, but at least half of them died on the stone stairways.”

What the cultivator had said instantly impacted Qin Yu’s impression of the Yan family.

“The Yan family has such a high threshold.” Qin Yu snorted coldly in his heart.

Nonetheless, Qin Yu still walked in the direction of the stone stairways.

After a while, jade-like stone stairways appeared in front of Qin Yu.

These stone stairways led straight to the clouds. When one looked up, one could not see the end of it but only the white clouds.

“Does the Yan family regard themselves as Asgard?” Qin Yu frowned.

He looked at the stone stairways and saw many cultivators climbing up, one after another. It was as if this stone stairway was the only way to change their destiny.

...

The stone stairways were crystal clear and incomparably clean. However, no one knew how much blood had stained the stone stairways or how many ghosts were lying on them.

Qin Yu took a deep breath. Though unhappy with the Yan family, he still stepped on the stone stairways.
