Chapter 757: Martial Saint! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Granny Qin said anxiously, “Didn’t people say that Martial Saints can no longer appear in the current era?”

“That’s right. Normally, it’s impossible for a Martial Saint to appear in the current era.”

“Regardless of whether you’re a prodigy or you have a strong bloodline, it’s impossible for you to become a Martial Saint.”

“Otherwise, people like Ye Qing, Jiang He, and the others would have the chance to become a Martial Saint.”

“However, the current prediction is that Qin Yu will break this deadlock.”

Hearing these words, Granny Qin felt a chill run down her spine!

She knew very well that Qin Yu was a threat to the Martial Arts Association, but she had never thought that Qin Yu would step into the Martial Saint realm.

Not only Granny Qin, but the entire Jingdu Martial Arts Association also thought so.

Therefore, although they had taken measures against Qin Yu, they didn’t go too far.

“Is... is the prophecy accurate?” Granny Qin asked unwillingly.

“I don’t know, but the prophecy has never been wrong,” a higher-up said coldly.

Granny Qin gritted her teeth, stood up and asked, “What should we do now?”

A higher-up said coldly, “Use all methods to get rid of Qin Yu immediately. We must not give him the slightest chance to become a Martial Saint.”

“That’s right. With his current abilities, he’s not even worth mentioning.”

Granny Qin immediately frowned.

She hesitated for a long time before she stood up and said, “But... I have made an agreement with Qin Yu.”

“You can go back on your agreement. Don’t follow in the Han family’s footsteps,” said one of the higher-ups coldly.

Granny Qin said with some regret, “But I. . . I have signed the heavenly guardian book with Qin Yu.”

As soon as these words were said, the scene instantly fell into silence.

“If I lose, I have to let Qin Yu enter the second Mystic Realm,” Granny Qin continued.

The atmosphere at the scene instantly froze.

Granny Qin’s face was full of self-blame.

She suddenly stood up and said, “If I lose, I’m willing to have my soul taken away, and I definitely won’t bring Qin Yu into the second Mystic Realm!”

“No.” The higher-ups denied Granny Qin’s words.

“We won’t watch you die, so don’t worry.”

“Bring your pet here, and we will give him power.”

Granny Qin’s face was full of excitement.

“Are... are you telling the truth?” Granny Qin’s voice almost trembled.

“What do you think?” A higher-up said unhappily.

Granny Qin hurriedly said, “Okay, okay. I’ll go and bring Blackie over now. Thank you, higher-ups!”

She was almost kneeling on the ground. Her excitement was self-evident.

With the help of higher-ups, Blackie would definitely win!

After the meeting ended, Granny Qin quickly found Blackie.

She brought Blackie all the way back to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association and then took him into the Mystic Realm.

...

At this moment, Qin Yu knew nothing about this.

There were only three days left. It was rare for Qin Yu to have time to rest.

He lay in the courtyard and basked in the sun all day long. He was very happy.

“You’re about to fight with the Heaven Swallowing Python. Why aren’t you worried at all?” The man with the mustache squatted on the wall and muttered as he ate.

Qin Yu smiled faintly and said, “I fought with Blackie yesterday. As expected, he isn’t my match.”

The man with the mustache rolled his eyes and said, “Aren’t you afraid that he has some kind of trump card?”

“If he has it, I have it too,” Qin Yu said with a faint smile.

Qin Yu wasn’t afraid of anyone at all when it came to the foundation of spells.

Even if it was the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

In the past few days, voices came from Yan Jinyao’s mansion next door all day long.

It seemed that he had more and more disciples.

With the fame that he had accumulated over the years and the background of the Yan family, many people came to follow him.

In just a few days, Yan Jinyao had nearly twenty disciples.

This kind of charisma was indeed surprising.

In the blink of an eye, two days had passed.

There was only one day left before he had to fight with Blackie.

“That’s weird.”

That afternoon, the man with the mustache walked in from outside the door.

“What’s wrong?” Qin Yu asked casually.

The man with the mustache touched his chin and said in a low voice, “I haven’t seen Blackie and Granny Qin for the past few days. I wonder what tricks they are playing.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu frowned slightly, and he couldn’t help but feel a little wary.

This time, winning or losing was extremely important to Qin Yu.

As long as he won, he would be able to find Yan Ruoxue, so he absolutely couldn’t have any accidents.

Qin Yu originally wanted to call Xia Hang, but when he touched his pocket, Qin Yu remembered that his phone had been destroyed by Granny Qin.

“In this era, it’s inconvenient to not have a phone,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

After thinking for a while, Qin Yu decided to go out and buy a phone first.

At the same time, he brought Xiao Yu out for a walk. After all, she was a little girl, so it wasn’t appropriate for her to stay at home all day.

Therefore, Qin Yu called Xiao Yu and left the martial arts academy.

They arrived at the largest shopping mall in Jingdu.

There was a sea of people here, and it was very lively.

This shopping mall was very large and comprehensive.

“Look, there’s a foreigner!” The man with the mustache pointed at the blonde woman not far away and said.

“So she’s a big foreign mare,” the man with the mustache muttered.

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “Shut your mouth or stay away from me.”

“What’s there to be afraid of? She doesn’t understand anyway,” the man with the mustache muttered.

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered with the man with the mustache anymore and immediately went to buy a cell phone.

After he was done, Qin Yu looked at Xiao Yu and said, “Wait for me for a while, I’m going to make a call.”

With that, Qin Yu turned around and walked into the bathroom.

He took out his phone and dialed Xia Hang’s number.

After a while, the call was answered.

“Xia Hang, where has Granny Qin gone recently?” Qin Yu asked directly.

Xia Hang said in a deep voice, “She seems to have taken Blackie to the Mystic Realm.”

“To the Mystic Realm?” Qin Yu frowned immediately.

Xia Hang hummed and continued, “Let me tell you some bad news. The eight higher-ups have already returned. You’d better be careful.”

Qin Yu remained silent.

As expected, it was just as Qin Yu had guessed.

“Looks like the call Granny Qin received a few days ago did indeed come from the higher-ups.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“Xia Hang, do you know the content of that meeting?” Qin Yu asked. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“I don’t know. I don’t have the right to participate in this meeting,” Xia Hang said.

This made Qin Yu even more worried.

“Got it.” Qin Yu hung up the phone.

He stood in the bathroom for a long time, and then said in a low voice, “It seems that I have to prepare a contingency plan.”
