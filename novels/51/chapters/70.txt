Chapter 71: Please Have Some Self-respect! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Hearing Qin Yu’s words, Wei Jiang instantly fell into silence.

He drank two mouthfuls of wine and didn’t speak for a long time.

“Mr. Wei, if you are in a difficult position, just pretend that I didn’t say anything just now.” Qin Yu raised his wine glass and said with a smile.

“No, no, no.” Wei Jiang hurriedly shook his head. “Mr. Qin, you misunderstood. Although the Shen family is a big customer of our bank, I have veto power.”

“Shen Yun just happens to be coming to our bank tomorrow. How about this, you accompany me there tomorrow?” Wei Jiang raised his wine glass and said.

Qin Yu hurriedly nodded and said, “Thank you very much, Mr. Wei!”

“Mr. Qin, you don’t have to be so polite. It’s a simple matter to take care of,” Wei Jiang said with a smile.

Without this loan, the Shen family’s capital chain would be broken. At that time, the Shen family would be ruined.

After eating the meal, Qin Yu left the Wei family’s home with Yao Qing.

“With this medicine and the one that Zheng Mingshuo gave me, I might be able to try to break through to the Foundation Establishment Stage,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

This made him a little excited.

Although there was only a level difference between the Foundation Establishment Stage and the Qi Refining Stage, there was a huge difference in strength.

The more Qin Yu thought about it, the more excited he became. He couldn’t wait to find out what power the Foundation Establishment Stage would bring.

Qin Yu and Yao Qing found a hotel and booked a room.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s phone suddenly rang.

He picked up the phone and saw that it was a call from Song Wei.

After the call was picked up, he heard Song Wei say with some surprise on the other end of the line, “Qin Yu, I have good news for you. My cousin has already helped me get a job interview tomorrow!”

“Is that so? Then congratulations,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

Song Wei then said, “Qin Yu, if you’re free, how about we go out for a walk?”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and immediately refused, “I’m sorry. I have something to do now. I’m afraid I can’t go over.”

Song Wei said with some regret, “Alright then. We’ll meet again another day.”

After Qin Yu hung up the phone, Yao Qing smiled and said, “Mr. Qin, aren’t we free now? Why did you reject her?”

Qin Yu sighed and said, “I don’t want to get too close to any woman other than Miss Yan.”

Yao Qing rolled his eyes and said, “Are you thinking too much? She just came to this city and doesn’t know anyone.”

“Maybe,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

That night, Qin Yu fell asleep early.

He had been too busy recently, and Qin Yu hadn’t had a good rest for a long time, so he slept very well that night.

The next day, Qin Yu got up early and tidied up to go to the Chuzhou Bank.

He wanted to call Yao Qing, but at this time, Yao Qing was sleeping soundly, so Qin Yu didn’t disturb him.

After leaving the house, Qin Yu took a taxi and headed straight for Chuzhou Bank.

As the largest bank in Chuzhou province, Chuzhou Bank naturally had an endless stream of customers.

Rumor had it that their deposits were among the top in the whole country.

At the entrance, there were all kinds of luxury cars, such as Bentleys, Rolls-royces, Maybach, and so on. All of them were commercial models, which was enough to prove Chuzhou Bank’s status in the eyes of businessmen.

Just as Qin Yu was about to enter the door, he was suddenly patted on the shoulder.

“Qin Yu? You’re actually here too!” He turned around and saw Song Wei standing with a man.

Qin Yu said with some surprise, “Song Wei? What are you doing here?”

Song Wei smiled and said, “I’m here to work. Today, my cousin will take me to see their manager and apply for the position.”

“What about You? Are you also here for work?” Song Wei asked back.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No, I’m here to look for the bank’s president.”

“The bank’s president?” Before Song Wei could say anything, his cousin couldn’t help but laugh.

“You’re a little too full of yourself. Do you know the status of Chuzhou Bank’s president?” His cousin shook his head and said.

Qin Yu smiled and didn’t explain.

“Qin Yu, if you are looking for a job, my cousin might be able to help you,” Song Wei smiled and said.

“Okay, then thank you very much,” Qin Yu replied casually.

The few of them chatted as they walked toward Chuzhou Bank.

They learned that this boy was called Li Yan, and he was the son of Song Wei’s uncle.

This time, Li Yan had to pull a lot of strings to help Song Wei find a job before he found the manager of Chuzhou Bank.

Wei Jiang hadn’t arrived yet, and Qin Yu had nothing to do, so he followed Song Wei to the manager’s office.

“Don’t talk later. Mr. Zhang is a big shot. Don’t offend him,” Li Yan warned before entering the door.

Song Wei quickly nodded and said, “I know. Don’t worry.”

“The same goes for you,” Li Yan glanced at Qin Yu and said.

Qin Yu nodded.

After that, they pushed the door open and entered the manager’s office.

As soon as they entered, they saw the manager hugging a woman in a business suit. When she saw Qin Yu and the others, the woman hurriedly jumped off the manager’s leg.

“What’s wrong with you? Don’t you know how to knock when you come in?” Mr. Zhang said with some displeasure.

Li Yan quickly smiled apologetically and said, “I’m sorry, Mr. Zhang. We were rude.”

Mr. Zhang waved his hand and looked at the woman in business attire. He said, “You can go out first.”

“Okay, Mr. Zhang.” The woman in business attire nodded and walked out of the office.

After she left, Li Yan quickly dragged Song Wei in front of Mr. Zhang.

“Mr. Zhang, this is my cousin, Song Wei. I told you last time.” Li Yan nodded and bowed.

Mr. Zhang looked at Song Wei, and his eyes suddenly lit up.

This woman was really beautiful!

“This is your cousin?” Mr. Zhang quickly changed his attitude.

“She’s really pretty.” Mr. Zhang looked at Song Wei with a lecherous look in his eyes.

Song Wei quickly said, “Nice to meet you, Mr. Zhang.”

“Gee, don’t be so formal. Take a seat!” Mr. Zhang personally stood up and pulled Song Wei to sit at the side.

“Song Wei, how many people are there in your family? Where do you live? How old are you this year?” Mr. Zhang held Song Wei’s hand and asked with a lecherous look. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Song Wei’s expression was a little awkward. She hurriedly pulled her hand out and answered Mr. Zhang’s questions one by one.

Mr. Zhang grabbed Song Wei’s hand again and said with a mischievous smile, “Why are you calling me Mr. Zhang? Just call me by my name. If you’re free tonight, how about we go out for dinner together?”

Song Wei said awkwardly, “Mr. Zhang, I don’t think... that’s necessary...”

“What’s there to be shy about? It’s only right for me to treat you to dinner...” Mr. Zhang said as he touched Song Wei’s leg.

“Mr. Zhang!” Li Yan saw the situation and hurriedly shouted.

But Mr. Zhang didn’t care at all. He didn’t say anything and put his hand on Song Wei’s leg.

Song Wei pushed Mr. Zhang’s hand away and stood up. “Mr. Zhang, please have some self-respect!”

When he saw Song Wei’s attitude, Mr. Zhang’s expression gradually darkened.
