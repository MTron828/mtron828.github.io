Chapter 1475: Chapter 1,475, pill refinement King 1

The pill refinement King remained silent. The entire great hall was silent.

It was as if everyone could sense a trace of danger.

This kind of dilemma wasn’t a good thing for them.

“I do have an idea.”Just as everyone was in a dilemma, a guard at the side suddenly spoke.

“What idea can a guard like you have? Do you have the right to speak here!”An old man immediately shouted.

The guard’s body tensed up, not daring to make a sound.

At this moment, the alchemy king waved his hand and said, “Let’s hear it first. Maybe he really has a good idea.”

The old man wanted to say something else, but was interrupted by the Alchemy King’s wave of his hand.

Then, the Alchemy King looked at the guard, indicating for him to continue.

The guard smiled. “Isn’t he going to participate in the assessment? Isn’t that simple? In any case, the assessment criteria will be decided by you. Why Don’t you give him a particularly difficult question and make him unable to answer it?”

“In this way, we won’t Offend Qin Yu, and we can also give the Heavenly Cloud sect an explanation.”

Hearing this, everyone’s eyes instantly lit up.

The guard’s words were undoubtedly a reminder to them that this was indeed an excellent method!

“HMPH, what kind of method is this? You’re just a guard, how can you have so many words!”

However, the expected praise didn’t appear. Instead, it was a stern shout.

“Hurry up and leave. Just do your job well.”The few old men waved their hands and dismissed the guard.

After he walked far away, the alchemy king said in a low voice, “I have to say, his method is indeed feasible.”

“Mm, let’s do as he says. Tonight, we’ll think about what kind of difficult problem we should give him,”another old man said.

Thus, the alchemy king sent a trusted aide to be responsible for responding to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu, who was waiting, saw the guard coming down and hurriedly stood up to welcome him.

“How is it?”Qin Yu asked.

The guard opened his mouth and said with a dark face, “I don’t know. Anyway, I’ve already told them. You can wait here by yourself.”

After saying this, he didn’t say anything more.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but mutter, “What kind of illness is this...”

Just as Qin Yu was puzzled, an old man came down from upstairs.

This old man looked like he was in his eighties or nineties. He looked like a skinny old man.

He walked toward Qin Yu with a smile and cupped his hands, saying, “Your Excellency is Mr. Qin Yu, Mr. Qin.”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows. It seemed that he had recognized him.

“It’s me. I’m here to take the Alchemist test,”Qin Yu went straight to the point.

The old man smiled and said, “Sure. We, The Alchemist Sage, Welcome Mr. Qin to join us. After our discussion, we have decided to take the test on you in three days. What do you think?”

“It’s too slow. I Can’t wait that long. Hurry up,”Qin Yu urged.

Hearing this, the old man couldn’t help but be stunned. Then he smiled bitterly and said, “Then I’ll discuss it with you as soon as possible. What do you think?”

“Give me a specific time,”Qin Yu said with a wave of his hand.

The old man thought for a moment and said, “How about this? Come here the day after tomorrow.”

“Okay, then it’s settled.”Qin Yu immediately stood up from the ground.

He patted the soil on his butt and turned around to leave.

According to the time he said, there were only two days left.

Qin Yu did not waste any time. He bought a batch of herbs from the medicine sage and found a place to stay for the time being.

That night, Qin Yu took out the medicinal cauldron and began to refine the nascent soul pill.

The first reason was to test his own method and familiarize himself with it. After all, it had been so long since he had refined a pill.

The second was to test out how much the difference between the herbs would affect the pill.

That night, Qin Yu refined five nascent soul pills, two of which were damaged.

The next day, Qin Yu refined eight nascent soul pills, one of which was damaged.

At night, Qin Yu familiarized himself with the technique. At the same time, he had nearly twenty nascent soul pills in his hand.

Qin Yu wiped the sweat off his forehead. He looked at the flames dancing in his palms and could not help but smile.

The next day was the day he had agreed with them. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Qin Yu did not make any preparations and rushed toward the medicine sage city.

At the entrance of the Medicine Sage City, the old man from a few days ago had been waiting for Qin Yu.

After seeing Qin Yu, the old man walked over quickly.

“Mr. Qin.”The old man cupped his hands towards Qin Yu.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “How is it? Can we begin?”

The old man smiled and said, “Of course. The examiners are waiting for you upstairs. Please follow me.”

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude, then followed behind him and stepped into the medicine Saint Hall.

The moment he stepped in, Qin Yu smelled an extremely strong medicinal fragrance. This internal Qi assaulted his nose, and Qin Yu’s pores even opened unconsciously.

“As expected of the Holy Region,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

This was the first time he felt the difference in resources after stepping into the holy region.

Such an environment was simply impossible on Earth.

“If I grew up in the holy region since I was young, my strength would definitely not be only at the nascent soul stage,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Even in Earth’s environment, Qin Yu had such a cultivation. The path in the future was unimaginable.
