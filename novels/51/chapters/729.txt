Chapter 730: The Power of the Tang Clan Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The Tang City wasn’t big, but there were many people coming and going.

Normally speaking, it was almost impossible for this kind of city to produce more than 20 Martial Marquises.

Not to mention the small Tang City, but even Jingdu might not be able to do it.

“Perhaps the Tang City really does have some secrets,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Therefore, he sat at Tang Mo’s side and took a sip of his wine.

“I can see that Mr. Tang has a very high prestige in Tang City,” Qin Yu said as he shook his wine glass.

Upon hearing this, Tang Mo immediately said with some pride, “Of course! No matter which big shot comes to the Tang City, they must first greet me, Tang Mo!”

“Impressive.” Qin Yu gave Tang Mo a thumbs up.

“Young Master Tang, the Martial Marquis realm is the highest level. How can the Tang family have so many Martial Marquises?” Qin Yu asked.

Tang Mo said proudly, “This is nothing. The Tang family even has three Martial Marquises at the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm!”

“Were these people trained by you, or...” Qin Yu asked tentatively.

Tang Mo snorted lightly. “The Tang family is extremely particular about loyalty! Do you think the Martial Marquises that we spent money to find are loyal enough?”

After saying that, Tang Mo pointed at the surrounding Martial Marquises and said, “If I tell these servants to kneel, they absolutely won’t dare to stand. This is absolute command!”

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

The Tang family was actually able to nurture more than 20 Martial Marquises?

One had to know that nurturing a Martial Marquis was an extremely resource-consuming thing.

Even if they were talented, stepping into the Martial Marquis realm required a huge amount of resources. If it was converted into money, a Martial Marquis would probably spend billions.

Most importantly, even if one had money, they might not be able to create a Martial Marquis.

“Mr. Tang, stepping into the rank of Martial Marquis is an extremely difficult task, and it also consumes a lot of resources. Usually, for a prosperous family to have one or two Martial Marquises is already worthy of praise,” Qin Yu continued to try to trick him.

“Although the Tang family is wealthy, there are some resources that can’t be obtained with just money. For example, herbs, spiritual energy, and so on.”

Tang Mo said proudly, “The Tang family doesn’t lack resources! With The Tang family’s ability, even if we create ten more Martial Marquises, it wouldn’t be a problem!”

This immediately made Qin Yu even more surprised.

Just what kind of existence was the Tang family, to actually have so many resources?

The more Tang Mo talked, the more excited he became. He kept bragging about the Tang family’s foundation.

And Qin Yu could also discern Tang Mo’s personality and character.

As long as he brainlessly bragged about how awesome he was, he would get the upper hand.

“Sigh, before I met Mr. Tang, I always thought that my achievements were already pretty good.” Qin Yu pretended to sigh.

“But ever since I met Young Master Tang, I suddenly feel that I’ve accomplished nothing. I can’t be compared to Young Master Tang at all.”

Hearing Qin Yu’s words, Tang Mo was even happier.

He took the initiative to pour a glass of wine for Qin Yu and said with a smile, “Bro, what are you talking about? You are also very powerful. I have heard of your great name in Tang City!”

“Yes, yes, yes. Young Master Tang is flattering me,” Qin Yu said humbly.

Tang Mo pulled Qin Yu’s arm and said, “I just realized today that you understand me! I like your personality very much!”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Yes, yes, yes. Thank you for your appreciation, Young Master Tang.”

The more Tang Mo spoke, the happier he became. Later on, he even called Qin Yu his buddy.

Meanwhile, Qin Yu wasn’t stingy with his compliments at all. He kept flattering Tang Mo..

After a few hours, Tang Mo completely treated Qin Yu as a buddy.

“Bro, as long as it’s in the territory of Tang City, the Martial Arts Association or the aristocratic families of Jingdu won’t be able to do anything to you!” Tang Mo patted his chest and said.

“As long as it’s within the Tang City territory, I promise to protect you!”

Qin Yu hurriedly cupped his hands and said, “Then thank you, Young Master Tang.”

“You still don’t have a place to stay, right?” At this time, Tang Mo seemed to have thought of something.

He looked at the attendant beside him and said, “Go, give the villa on the island to my buddy!”

The attendant didn’t dare to say anything more and hurriedly took out the key and handed it to Qin Yu.

“Young Master Tang, this isn’t good, right?” Qin Yu said.

Tang Mo waved his hand and said, “This is nothing! Bro, if there’s anything you need, just tell me! There’s nothing in the Tang City that I, Tang Mo, can’t do!”

Seeing this, Qin Yu didn’t stand on ceremony anymore and nodded. “Then thank you very much.”

Then, Qin Yu probed, “Young Master Tang, I heard that precious herbs often appear in the Tang City. Is that true?”

Tang Mo chuckled and said, “That’s right, the Tang City is a place of great fortune!”

“Many foreign powers have come to look for herbs. Of course, they have to greet the Tang family first. Otherwise, they won’t be able to leave!”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and suddenly felt a little worried.

According to what Tang Mo said, the Tang family would probably be involved in this ten-thousand-year-old herbs.

It wouldn’t be a wise choice to confront the Tang family directly.

However, Qin Yu was a little conflicted at this moment because he didn’t know whether Tang Mo knew about the ten-thousand-year-old herbs at all.

If he didn’t know, Qin Yu would leak the news if he told him rashly.

After thinking about it for a long time, Qin Yu still didn’t reveal his intentions in the end.

Time flew by and it was late at night. The attendant brought Qin Yu to the villa on the island. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Mr. Qin, this is your residence,” the attendant said politely.

“Wow, this house is really beautiful,” the mustached man said excitedly.

“Mr. Qin, if you have anything you need, this is my contact information.” The attendant handed Qin Yu a business card.

Qin Yu took the business card and said politely, “Thank Young Master Tang for me.”

The attendant nodded and said, “Okay, then I won’t disturb you.”

After the attendant left, Qin Yu walked into the villa.

The man with the mustache looked mind-blown. He kept scurrying up and down the stairs.

Qin Yu didn’t care about these luxurious mansions. He randomly picked a room.

This house had a balcony, and in front of the balcony was the blue sea.

Qin Yu stood on the balcony, his brows slightly furrowed, as if he was thinking about something.

“What are you thinking about?”

At this moment, Xiao Yu suddenly walked in from outside the door.

Qin Yu glanced at Xiao Yu and said, “I came to Tang City this time for a ten-thousand-year-old herb, but I don’t know if I should tell Tang Mo about this.”

“Although Tang Mo seems pretty nice, ten-thousand-year-old herbs are top-grade treasures. No one can resist this temptation.”

Just as Qin Yu said, anyone could turn hostile when it came to resources, let alone Tang Mo, whom he had just met.

Xiao Yu was silent for a moment and said, “I think it’s better to tell him. The birth of the ten-thousand-year-old herbs will be earth-shattering. It’s impossible to hide it.”

“Why don’t you tell Tang Mo and win a favor from him?”

Qin Yu looked at Xiao Yu in surprise and said jokingly, “Xiao Yu, you’be grown up.”

Xiao Yu rolled her eyes at Qin Yu and said, “Think about it yourself. Anyway, this is just my suggestion.”
