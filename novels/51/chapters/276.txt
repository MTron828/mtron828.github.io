Chapter 277: Devouring Divine Sense Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

This time was different from usual. The ancestor didn’t knock Qin Yu to the ground. On the contrary, his voice was somewhat weak.

In the darkness, a weak figure slowly floated toward Qin Yu.

He raised his head to look at Qin Yu and said, “How is the Earth Fiend Valley?”

Qin Yu looked at the Earth Fiend Valley ancestor and said in a deep voice, “It’s done. Don’t worry.”

Hearing that, the ancestor hurriedly said, “What about the seal? Have you found a way to unseal it?”

“Yes, I found it.” Qin Yu nodded.

“Ancestor, don’t worry. It won’t be long before you can leave this place.”

The ancestor immediately raised his head and shouted, “Finally, finally! I can finally leave this d*mn place, hahaha!”

“Please wait a moment, ancestor. I will go and remove the seal for you now,” said Qin Yu.

The ancestor hurriedly nodded and said, “Good, good, well done! When I leave this place, I will definitely reward you well!”

“Thank you, ancestor,” said Qin Yu while suppressing the anger in his heart.

The ancestor activated the spell, and Qin Yu’s divine sense returned to his body.

He didn’t waste any time. He immediately closed his eyes and activated the spell left by his father to erase this mark.

This spell was none other than the divine judgment!

Updates by

It was precisely because he was looking for a way to erase the mark that Qin Yu was able to use the divine judgment on Hui Ming at a critical moment!

Qin Yu silently activated the spell. Rays of light exploded within his divine sense.

The rays of light flowed like a stream towards the mark.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly felt that the mark was attempting to devour his divine sense!

“Huh?” Qin Yu’s expression changed, and he immediately felt waves of shock!

This was... a mark that devoured divine sense!

In other words, the Earth Fiend Valley’s ancestor had deceived Qin Yu!

This divine sense wasn’t there to prevent Qin Yu from rebelling, as he had said, but to wait for an opportunity to devour Qin Yu’s divine sense!

If Qin Yu hadn’t discovered it in time, the ancestor might have used Qin Yu’s body to be reborn!

“The people of the Earth Fiend Valley are indeed extremely sinister,” Qin Yu said with narrowed eyes.

Qin Yu didn’t waste any more time. He immediately activated a spell to erase this mark.

Rays of light flowed like streams towards that mark.

In a flash, this mark was submerged.

Waves of piercing pain came from Qin Yu’s head, as if his divine sense was about to be cut apart!

The entire mark emitted streams of steam-like internal qi. In less than a minute, the mark was completely erased.

Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes. He tried to sense the mark, but there was nothing else in his divine sense other than that black dot.

“Phew.”

Qin Yu let out a deep breath. A cold glint flashed in his eyes.

It was time for the Earth Fiend Valley to get payback for its sins! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Qin Yu took out the stone statue from his bag and placed his hands on it. His divine sense was sucked into the stone statue.

The ancestor was extremely excited to see Qin Yu again!

He turned into a black shadow and instantly appeared in front of Qin Yu.

“How is it? Has the seal been lifted?” The ancestor asked anxiously.

Qin Yu didn’t answer. He only looked at the ancestor coldly.

After seeing Qin Yu’s hostile gaze, the ancestor said angrily, “I’m asking you a question. What’s wrong? Are you mute?”

After saying that, the ancestor waved his big hand again and smacked towards Qin Yu!

Unfortunately, this time, he didn’t manage to smack Qin Yu to the ground. Instead, Qin Yu grabbed his wrist!

The ancestor’s expression immediately changed. He roared angrily, “Do you want to rebel?!”

“Rebel?” Qin Yu’s voice became extremely cold.

“The Earth Fiend Valley is sinister and vicious. You have committed many evil deeds. Over the years, you have harmed countless people!” When Qin Yu said these words, he was practically gritting his teeth!

“And you’re the main culprit! I wish I could eat your flesh and peel off your skin!”

The ancestor’s expression changed. He looked at Qin Yu coldly and asked, “Who are you?”

Qin Yu sneered. “I am Qin Yu.”

The ancestor’s expression changed drastically! He roared, “You dared to lie to me? You dared to lie to me?!”

“That’s right. Not only did I lie to you, but I even used your strength to crush the Earth Fiend Valley!” Qin Yu sneered.

“Ah!!!”

The Earth Fiend Valley’s ancestor was on the verge of a breakdown. He raised his head and roared angrily!

“Brat, I will cut you into a thousand pieces and tear you apart!” The Earth Fiend Valley’s ancestor roared angrily.

In an instant, the cold wind in the stone statue burst out. Countless black rays of light shot towards Qin Yu!

Unfortunately, the Earth Fiend Valley’s ancestor’s strength had already been greatly diminished. All of his moves were no threat!

Rays of light shone from Qin Yu’s body, and he easily dodged the ancestor’s attack.

“It’s useless. You have lent me your strength many times, and now, you’re a cripple,” Qin Yu said with a sneer.

The ancestor of the Earth Fiend Valley was so angry that he was trembling, and his teeth were chattering!

He wished he could tear Qin Yu apart with his own hands!

“Old b*stard, you should have died a long time ago,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The ancestor of the Earth Fiend Valley gnashed his teeth and said, “Don’t be happy too early. I dared to lend you my strength, so I naturally have a way to deal with you!”

“Oh really? Are you talking about the mark you left behind?” Qin Yu said with a sneer.

“That’s right! As long as my mind moves, your soul and spirit will be destroyed!” The ancestor said sinisterly.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “You can try.”

The ancestor didn’t say anything more and immediately muttered in a low voice to activate the spell!

But unfortunately, Qin Yu stood there without moving at all. His divine sense wasn’t affected at all.

“How is that possible?!” The expression of the ancestor of the Earth Fiend Valley changed!

He hurriedly activated the spell again, but it was still useless!

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Just now, the mark you laid down was erased by me. Old b*stard, what other tricks do you have? Go ahead and use them!”

The ancestor of the Earth Fiend Valley immediately panicked and said anxiously, “Qin Yu! I have helped you so many times, so why do you have to kill me?”

“Help me?” Qin Yu sneered again and again.

“Do you really think I don’t know your ulterior motive? It looks like you’re helping me, but in fact, you’re waiting for an opportunity to devour my divine sense, right?”

“You... how do you know?” The ancestor of the Earth Fiend Valley immediately became even more panicked.

Qin Yu said coldly, “You should go to h*ll and ask Satan.”

“Oh, no, I’m afraid you won’t have the chance to ask Satan.”

Qin Yu raised his hands and grabbed the ancestor of the Earth Fiend Valley!

“Heaven Swallowing Technique!”

Following Qin Yu’s roar, the ancestor’s divine sense began to distort!

“Ah!!!” The ancestor of the Earth Fiend Valley struggled with all his might, but there was no use in front of the Heaven Swallowing Technique!

“Qin Yu, you b*stard!!”

The ancestor’s divine sense was completely devoured by Qin Yu.

Endless dark energy was directly absorbed by Qin Yu!

“Crack!”

The stone statue was shattered at this moment!

The world inside the stone statue was slowly collapsing!

Qin Yu didn’t dare to waste time. He hurriedly left this space and returned to his body.

“Huh? This... This is...”

As soon as he returned to his body, Qin Yu’s expression couldn’t help but change in shock!
