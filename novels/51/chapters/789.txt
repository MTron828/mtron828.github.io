The voice reverberated in the fort for a long time, and this Martial Saint’s power had already completely entered Qin Yu’s body.

Qin Yu stood there without moving for a long time. He closed his eyes slightly, as if he was feeling this extreme power.

“Is this the power of a Martial Saint...” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice. He clenched his fists, and the power surged like an ocean!

This was a power that Qin Yu had never felt before. It was so powerful that he couldn’t extricate himself from it!

At this moment, Qin Yu couldn’t wait to know the limits of this Martial Saint power.

He even looked forward to the arrival of the Purple Flame Sect.

“How do you feel now?” Xue Yuzhi walked forward and asked.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Very good.”

“That’s good.” Xue Yuzhi also heaved a sigh of relief when she saw the situation.

The disc in front of her began to shatter, and in the blink of an eye, it turned into ruins.

Qin Yu pointed at the ruins in front of him and said with some doubt, “Auntie Xue, that young man just now is the ancestor of the Xue family? Why is he so young? It seems different from what I imagined.”

Xue Yuzhi explained, “Many top experts of the family would leave a backup plan at their peak to protect the family. What you see is the peak of the ancestor.”

Qin Yu suddenly understood.

These people were thinking far ahead.

The peak was usually when one was in his prime. No one would think about the future.

After walking out of the fort, Qin Yu followed Xue Yuzhi and came to the hall of the Xue family’s villa.

In the hall, the people of the Xue family were waiting nervously.

When they saw Qin Yu, they quickly stood up.

There seemed to be some vigilance in their eyes.

Even their attitude had become a little strange.

“Qin Yu, how... How do you feel?” Xue Yujie asked tentatively.

Qin Yu slightly bowed and said, “Mr. Xue, I feel very well now.”

After seeing Qin Yu’s attitude, Xue Yujie heaved a sigh of relief.

He was very worried that after Qin Yu obtained the power of a Martial Saint, he would turn hostile and refuse to acknowledge the promise.

“Then... the matter of the Purple Flame Sect will depend on you.” Xue Yujie said.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Don’t worry.”

At this moment, Old Master Xue suddenly said in a deep voice, “Qin Yu, although you have already obtained the power of the Martial Saint, I still want to know how you plan to protect the Xue family.”

“Regarding this question, we all want to know.” Xue Yujie also nodded and said.

Qin Yu sat on the sofa. He was silent for a moment and then glanced at the crowd.

“There is only one way to get it done once and for all,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“What way?” The few of them looked at Qin Yu in unison.

A trace of coldness flashed in Qin Yu’s eyes.

He said coldly, “That is to make all the forces in Sheng Kingdom submit to me!”

As soon as he said this, everyone gasped!

Make all the forces submit to one person? This idea was too crazy!

“Qin Yu, the major forces in Sheng Kingdom have been stationed for many years, but they have never been unified. You want everyone to submit to you? This... is almost impossible,” said Xue Yujie.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Simple. If they don’t agree, then kill them all.”

In any case, Qin Yu was currently in need of Golden Cores. If he killed them all, then he wouldn’t have to worry about Golden Cores anymore.

The people in the hall looked at each other. They seemed a bit afraid of Qin Yu’s words.

Qin Yu stood up and said, “Don’t worry. I promised the Xue family that I would protect the safety of the Xue family.”

“Qin Yu, do you know that other forces might also have the power of a Martial Saint?” Xue Yuzhi reminded him.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “It doesn’t matter.”

“Then do you know how many Martial Marquises there are in the various forces of the Sheng Kingdom? Altogether, there are at least close to a hundred Martial Marquises!” Xue Yujie said with a serious expression.

“One against a hundred? Qin Yu, do you really think you can do it?”

Qin Yu said indifferently, “In my eyes, Martial Marquises are just ants not worth mentioning.”

This was the confidence after obtaining the power of a Martial Saint!

As long as there was no Martial Saint in this world, Qin Yu wasn’t afraid of anyone!

When the crowd saw Qin Yu’s confident expression, they didn’t know what to say for a moment.

“Let’s wait for the Purple Flame Sect to come.” Qin Yu said with a smile.

After saying this, Qin Yu returned to his own residence.

As soon as he returned, the man with the mustache came over and said in surprise, “How is it? Did you get it?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, I got it.”

The man with the mustache immediately revealed a curious expression. He kept touching Qin Yu’s body as he muttered, “There doesn’t seem to be any changes...”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “I haven’t activated the Martial Saint’s power yet. This power can only last for a month at most. How could I bear to waste it?”

In the next two days.

Qin Yu sat cross-legged in his room. He didn’t leave the main door or the second door. He quietly waited for the arrival of the Purple Flame Sect.

Time flew by.

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

Early in the morning of this day.

The members of the Xue family stood on the square in unison. A trace of solemnity appeared on their faces.

They stared at the entrance with a hint of nervousness in their eyes.

At this moment, the sound of engines could be heard from the entrance.

Not long after, a few cars drove straight in.

The moment the cars stopped, more than ten Martial Marquises alighted from the cars!

The leader was a man dressed in black.

This man was tall and had a noble appearance. The faint aura of a Martial Marquis from his body was even more terrifying.

“It’s actually Bai Sha leading the team.” Xue Yujie and the others’expressions changed slightly when they saw this man. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Bai Sha led the group and walked towards Xue Yujie and the others.

He looked down at Xue Yujie and said indifferently, “Who in the Xue family is in charge?”

“Me.” Xue Yujie braced himself and walked out.

Bai Sha looked at Xue Yujie coldly and said in a cold voice, “The Purple Flame Sect has already given you three days. Now that three days have passed, how’s the discussion going?”

Xue Yujie took a deep breath and said, “Mister Bai, the Xue family has always respected the Purple Flame Sect. Do we have to fight today?”

Bai Sha narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “From what you mean, you don’t intend to accept the kind offer of the Purple Flame Sect.”

When Xue Yujie saw this, he couldn’t help but coldly say, “Bai Sha, the Xue family isn’t afraid of you!”

Bai Shan immediately laughed out loud when he heard this!

That frightening laughter reverberated in the Xue family for a long time. That intense unease filled the hearts of everyone in the Xue family.

“You don’t know your place!” Bai Sha’s laughter came to an abrupt end. He suddenly stretched out his hand and slapped towards Xue Yujie!

At this moment, a golden palm suddenly stretched out and grabbed Bai Sha’s wrist.

This hand was like an iron clamp, tightly grabbing Bai Sha’s wrist, making him unable to move.

Bai Sha’s expression changed slightly, and he said coldly, “Who are you?”

“I am your father!” Without a word, Qin Yu raised his golden palm and slapped Bai Sha!
