Hearing this, Hong Wu suddenly stood up and exclaimed, “Is what you said true?”

The young man hurriedly nodded and said, “It’s true! The whole provincial capital is talking about this! Look, there are videos on the internet!”

After saying this, the young man handed the phone to Hong Wu.

Hong Wu took the phone and stared at the screen.

On the screen, there was the scene of Qin Yu refining pills.

When he saw the blue spiritual fire in Qin Yu’s hand and the Danyun Phenomenon in the sky, his face was filled with shock!

“Quick, bring me my Ganoderma! Take me to Qin Yu immediately!” Hong Wu said anxiously. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

A mere Ganoderma wasn’thing if it meant he could be acquainted with such an extraordinary alchemist!

After all, the effects of the same herbs in the hands of alchemists were far greater than those of ordinary martial artists like them!

At this moment, Qin Yu was still waiting for Hong Wu.

He glanced at his phone and saw that it was already eleven o’clock in the evening.

“It seems that he won’t come.” Qin Yu’s expression was a little ugly.

Qin Yu didn’t like people who went back on their words.

“It’s time for me to rest.” Qin Yu stretched and yawned a few times.

At this moment, Hong Wu’s car parked downstairs.

Then, he saw Hong Wu running up in a hurry.

Hong Wu handed the Ganoderma to Qin Yu respectfully.

“Mr. Qin, I’m sorry. I was delayed today, so I came a little late,” Hong Wu said apologetically.

Qin Yu glanced at Hong Wu and said with a nonchalant smile, “Were you delayed by something, or were you testing me on purpose?”

Hong Wu’s expression changed slightly. He hurriedly shook his head and said, “Mr. Qin, I really had something to do. Otherwise, I would have brought it to you earlier!”

Although he said that, everyone knew the truth.

Qin Yu didn’t expose him. He took the Ganoderma and nodded. “Thank you, Mr. Hong.”

Hong Wu cupped his hands and said, “Mr. Qin, you must be joking. This thing was yours to begin with.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. Hong Wu was very tactful. He didn’t stay any longer and quickly left the hotel.

“Hong Wu really knows how to weigh the pros and cons.” Qin Yu played with the Ganoderma and couldn’t help but laugh.

“But... it’s a gain to get this Ganoderma.” Looking at the Ganoderma in his hand, Qin Yu was a little excited.

After putting away the Ganoderma, Qin Yu laid on the bed.

Soon, sleepiness overcame him.

The tiredness of the past few days was released at this moment, and Qin Yu quickly fell asleep.

The next day, there was still an endless stream of people who came to ask for the Nine Dragon Pill.

Many high-ranking officials and nobles came one after another. They offered a high price in exchange for this Nine Dragon Pill.

Mr. Yang received them politely and expressed Qin Yu’s intention.

“Mr. Qin said that this Nine Dragon Pill isn’t for sale. If you want it, you can exchange it with hundred-year-old herbs,” Mr. Yang said politely.

When everyone heard this, they all felt a little awkward.

Hundred-year-old herbs weren’t easy to come by, like cabbages by the roadside. Even for these rich people, it wasn’t easy to obtain them.

Just like that, after two days, there were still people coming to ask for the pill every day, but no one took out the hundred-year-old herbs.

Three days later, Qin Yu still didn’t wake up.

Mr. Yang glanced at Qin Yu’s room and couldn’t help but lament, “Mr. Qin has slept for five whole days, but he still hasn’t waken up. Could he be dead?”

Thinking of this, Mr. Yang tiptoed into the room to check.

After confirming that Qin Yu was still alive, Mr. Yang was relieved.

At this moment, there was a knock on the door.

Mr. Yang quickly walked forward and opened the door.

As soon as the door was opened, he saw a young man in an expensive looking suit.

There were two bodyguards beside this young man.

“I heard that you have the Nine Dragon Pill?” The young man entered the door and said straightforwardly.

Mr. Yang said politely, “Yes, but you need to exchange it for hundred-year-old herbs.”

The young man nodded. He stretched out his hand, and the bodyguard immediately handed over a box.

“This is a hundred-year-old ginseng. Is it okay to exchange it for the Nine Dragon Pill in your hand?” The young man asked.

Mr. Yang quickly said, “Of course, but I have to check it first.”

After saying that, Mr. Yang took the ginseng and carefully looked at it.

After a while, Mr. Yang frowned.

He raised his head to look at the young man and said, “This doesn’t seem to be a hundred-year-old ginseng. This seems to be an ordinary herb.”

Hearing this, the young man pretended to be shocked and said, “Impossible, I brought a hundred-year-old ginseng!”

Mr. Yang said helplessly, “You were scammed by someone.”

The young man sneered, pointed at the ginseng in Mr. Yang’s hand and said, “You secretly changed it. I brought the hundred-year-old ginseng!”

Mr. Yang’s expression changed, and he immediately understood!

This young man clearly wanted to snatch the ginseng away!

“Don’t talk nonsense.” Mr. Yang returned the ginseng to the young man.

However, the young man snorted. “It was clearly you who wanted to take the hundred-year-old ginseng, so you swapped the ginseng and used it to deceive Qin Yu. Then, you framed me!”

Mr. Yang was instantly livid with anger. He stood up and said, “How can you make things up?!”

The young man sneered. “Do you think will Qin Yu believe you or me? Let me tell you, I will get the Nine Dragon Pill!”

After saying that, the young man waved his hand, then the two bodyguards behind him immediately stepped forward and pressed Mr. Yang on the table!

Then, the bodyguard snatched the Nine Dragon Pill.

“Young Master.” The bodyguard handed the Nine Dragon Pill to the young man.

A proud smile appeared on the young man’s face. He put away the Nine Dragon Pill and then said with a nonchalant smile, “I will take this Nine Dragon Pill. As for how you explain it to Qin Yu, that’s your business.”

Mr. Yang gritted his teeth and said, “When Mr. Qin wakes up, he definitely won’t let you off the hook!”

The young man laughed loudly and said, “Won’t let me off the hook? Do you know who I am? I’m Jiang Yu of the Jiang Family! If he, Qin Yu, is smart, he wouldn’t offend me for this pill!”

After saying this, Jiang Yu turned around and left.

Mr. Yang’s expression was somewhat ugly.

He had heard of the Jiang family before.

They were a blue-blood family in Chuzhou! They were many times more powerful than the Shen family was in the past!

Mr. Yang was at a loss.

At this moment, there was another knock on the door.

He opened the door and saw that it was Wei Ming.

Wei Ming cupped his hands to Mr. Yang and said, “Mr. Yang, where’s Mr. Qin?”

Mr. Yang said dejectedly, “He’s sleeping.”

Wei Ming frowned and said, “Mr. Yang, why do you look so sickly?”

Mr. Yang forced a smile and immediately told Wei Ming what had happened.

“Jiang Yu?” Hearing this name, Wei Ming immediately frowned.
