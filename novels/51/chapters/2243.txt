2244 Xi Menn’s Sword

“You do have some tricks up your sleeve!”

The self-destruction of the three True Saints, coupled with the strange techniques of the Hui Yin, Qin Yu did not dare to procrastinate.

He activated the cosmic form, and giant arms suddenly crossed at the front.

Qin Yu’s body was suddenly thrown out a thousand meters away. Qin Yu patted his somewhat numb arms and looked at Hui Yin coldly.

“I’ve had enough fun. It’s your turn now.”

Qin Yu said coldly.

“Haha, how arrogant! Do you think that’s all I have?”

Hui Yin chuckled sinisterly.

All of a sudden, a blood-red light shot out from his head. A fist-sized blood ball wrapped around his soul and flew away. The vitality in his body burst into flames. It was so fast that it was hard for people to react.

“He actually ran away? He actually forced Hui Yin to use Blood Escape!”

Xing Mou could not believe it.

“Can you escape?”

Qin Yu said coldly. He stepped the line word formula, his hands formed the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch, and with the help of the Gale Resistance Boot.

In the blink of an eye, he arrived above the blood-red pupil and grabbed it fiercely.

A wisp of spiritual fire fiercely burned Hui Yin’s divine sense.

“Ah! Spare me! My Blood Sect will definitely not let you off if you kill me.”

Hui Yin let out a shrill and miserable scream.

Qin Yu looked indifferent as he increased the burning of the spiritual fire, directly erasing his soul.

“Wang Feng, are you alright?”

Qin Yu came to Wang Feng’s side and asked with concern.

At this moment, Wang Feng’s hands and feet were trembling due to the excessive consumption of his divine sense.

Blood was constantly seeping out of his mouth and nose. He had suffered inhuman torture lately.

“I’m fine, Brother. Thank you for saving my life.”

He said with difficulty. He could no longer stand and collapsed onto the ground.

“Go in and rest for a while.”

Qin Yu wrapped Wang Feng with Sumeru energy and sent him into the Sumeru Space.

With Xiaoru and Little Ginseng around, he should be able to recover much faster.

Qin Yu looked coldly at the three people in the distance and did not make a move.

Every grievance had its perpetrator, and every debt had its debtor. The one who had chopped off Chang Mang’s hands was the Si family.

But if these three people continued to be disrespectful, he did not mind showing them some tricks.

“Do you really think you’re invincible just because you killed these three old men?”

Xing Mou’s expression was cold.

“Forget it.”

Wu Feng frowned and said.

“Just like that?” Xing Mou revealed an indignant expression.

“Just tell the Blood Sect what happened here.”

Wu Feng said indifferently. Qin Yu’s strength greatly exceeded his expectations.

“Alright, the Blood Sect will teach him how to behave.”

A cold smile appeared on Xing Mou’s face.

At this moment, in one of the sects on the eighth level of purgatory, a middle-aged man with a commanding presence looked at the three broken jade pendants before him and smashed the cup in his hand on the ground.

“Send out all the men you have. You must find out who killed Hui Yin and the others!”

“Hui Yin and the others were investigating the entrance to the ancient realm. Did someone having the same information kill to silence them?”

An elderly man behind him said indifferently.

“It was the patriarch of the sect who sent me a message about the ancient realm. Logically speaking, no one else should know about it.” The middle-aged man shook his head.

…

A white-robed man sat cross-legged on the ground among many demonic beasts with terrifying demonic qi.

The terrifying demonic beasts around him subconsciously avoided his territory.

Suddenly, he opened his eyes and looked into the depths.

Qin Yu suddenly felt his heart palpitate. An incredibly terrifying feeling rose from his divine sense. His eyes focused on the depths of the purgatory. At this moment, his divine sense felt a suffocating sharpness.

It was hundreds of thousands of meters away but could still pierce through his divine sense.

As the sword intent of the white-robed man rose, the swordsmen in purgatory suddenly realized their swords trembling as if they would be unsheathed at any moment. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“What’s going on?”

A cultivator tried hard to control his sword.

“I can’t control my flying sword anymore!”

Someone roared.

…

At the ninth level of purgatory.

“Is Xi Menn going to make a move? It’s rare to see him being so serious.”

Uncle Ling looked at the eighth level of the Mystic Realm and said thoughtfully.

“What a genius. It’s a pity that he’s unwilling to join our sect. Uncle Ling, who do you think he is going to attack?”

Ling Yurou stared at the sword in the evil extermination’s hand and sighed.

“I’m not sure. This exiled man from the Holy Region has been here for over 800 years. Logically speaking, he doesn’t have any enemies. I wonder who this sword intent aims at.”

“His talent is probably top-notch in the Holy Region. I wonder why he was exiled here by the Holy Region.”

Ling Yurou frowned and said.

The evil extermination looked at the eighth floor expressionlessly, and no one knew what he was thinking.

Xi Menn stood up and walked toward the seventh floor step by step.

The sound of the sword chant resounded from the space at the eighth level down to the seventh level, filling the entire purgatory with its clear and melodious sword chant.

A sword shadow appeared above Xi Menn’s head. One begot two, two generated three, and three spawned all things, transforming into thousands of sword shadows.

“Why does Xi Menn attack that guy?”

“That guy seems to be from the Holy Region as well. He caused a stir on the Black Platform Continent previously, so it should be a wanted order from the Holy Region.”

“Xi Menn was also a genius exiled here more than 800 years ago. Why are there so many freaks in the Holy Region?”

A white-robed figure appeared in Qin Yu’s divine sense. He held a sword in his hand and walked forward step by step.

His pace was very slow, but it was like a sword that made Qin Yu feel unavoidable no matter what.

The veins on Qin Yu’s face bulged, and his willpower resisted the sword intent with all its might.

It was a resistance through mental persistence.

“Why isn’t he moving?”

Ling Yurou asked curiously.

“Xi Menn’s sword intent has already locked onto him. This kid will die if he can’t break free from this sword intent. What a terrifying sword intent. Even I, just a bystander, felt my divine sense about to tear apart.”

Uncle Ling sighed with emotion and said.

The evil exterminator looked at the slightly agitated sword and gently touched the hilt. Only then did the sword calm down.

Xi Menn’s deep obsession with the sword and Qin Yu’s powerful consciousness were fighting against each other.

Xi Menn came to Qin Yu and slowly raised his hand.

The sword in his hand slowly stabbed toward Qin Yu’s heart. The ice-cold blade instantly pierced through Qin Yu’s body he was proud of, and stabbed toward his heart.

Qin Yu suddenly thought of the ordinary person who was chased out of the Su family. The person who was not afraid of being shattered in making advancement. The person his father had always trusted and the equally silly girl who had been waiting for him!

“This place is definitely not my end! Hahaha!”

Qin Yu laughed maniacally. His long hair swayed wildly, and his divine sense struggled out of that terrifying sword intent.

He raised his foot and took a step back. In an instant, he was already a thousand meters away.

His speed became increasingly faster. He activated the line word formula to the limit, and even more so for Shrinking Ground Into An Inch.

The sword light was right before his chest, not a single step slower.

Their bodies moved like flowing lights.

Seventh level, sixth level, fifth level…

The terrifying speed made the surrounding cultivators tremble in fear.

“Ding!”

Qin Yu’s fist of destruction landed on the sword.

One punch, two punches, and thousands of punches landed on the sword in an instant.
