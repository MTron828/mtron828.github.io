However, even after the curse was lifted, his nose and eyes remained flat.

Covered by skin, his appeared as if a natural deformity.

“As time passes, the Curse Seal will gradually consume his original senses. Even after the seal is removed, his eyes, nose, and tongue won’t be able to recover,” Jing Xin explained, noting Qin Ytl’s confusion.

“Even after being rescued, they can’t restore their original appearance?” Qin Yu found it hard to believe.

Jing Xin nodded reluctantly, and she said, “This punishment permanently deprives a person of their five senses. It essentially cripples the soul, rendering it incomplete. His senses of sight, smell, and taste will never return. Right now, he can only regain his combat abilities. However, without those three senses, he might unleash an even stronger will in battle. You all need to be careful,” Linger cautioned.

The middle-aged man remained remarkably calm despite the tortures inflicted upon him, earning Qin Yu’s admiration. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Gathering his aura, he assumed a stance.

Qin Yu’s mind flashed upon recognizing the familiar stance.

It was a stance he knew all too well! The technique of Zhan Pu, the peak master of Demon-slaying Peak!

The tortured figure before him was none other than Zhan Pu, Qin Yu’s former Peak Master at Demon-Slaying Peak!

Qin Yu’s eyes turned blood -red as he fixed his gaze on the five members of the Demon Sealing Valley behind him.

Whoosh!

An energy arrow in Qin Yu’s hand burst with scorching light. With 85% of its power, it pierced through Zhan Pu and exploded before Roger, unleashing intense heat waves in all directions.

Bang!

A crisp sound echoed as countless cracks appeared around Roger.

A bell-shaped object fell to the ground, devoid of all energy traces.

“Excellent! Excellent! Attacking you now doesn’t violate any rules!” Roger grinned like a viper.

“What are you doing?” Ling’er anxiously stomped her foot. Neither she nor Jing Xin expected Qin Yu to suddenly attack Roger and his companions.

Projection!

Tiger Wings vanished into the void, only to reappear in this space after several reflections.

A saber light flashed beside him, and the head of the person next to him instantly flew up.

“Spell, seal!”

Besides Roger, a woman began chanting a spell, and circle after circle of magical runes appeared on her body.

Then, like a serpent, they swiftly surrounded Qin Yu.

A tremendous sealing aura seeped into every pore of Qin Yu’s skin.

Qin Yu suddenly felt his body become incredibly heavy, and a drowsy sensation enveloped his divine soul, threatening to plunge him into unconsciousness.

“Stop!” Jing Xin angrily shouted.

“Jing Xin, these outsiders are attacking our disciples of the Demon Sealing Valley. If you dare to intervene, even as an inner sect disciple, you’ll meet your end here today!”

Roger’s laughter was maniacal. He had anticipated a struggle, but he hadn’t expected this foolhardy youngster to attack them directly, simplifying matters greatly.

“Who administered this punishment?” Qin Yu’s voice remained remarkably calm as he addressed the disciples of the Demon Sealing Valley.

“Hahaha, it was me. How does it feel? I can provide you with more details. There were four or five others with him, all subjected to our punishment. Two couldn’t endure it and chose suicide. The rest are languishing in our Demon Sealing Valley’s prison, leading lives worse than death,” Roger boasted, producing a mirror.

He projected images of Zhan Pu and the others’ pitiful state.

“I see,” Qin Yu replied tersely.

“Qin Yu, don’t act impulsively. Remember, we’re in the Demon Sealing Valley!” Jiang Feng and Su Su urged anxiously from behind.

With one of their members already dead, further aggression would only escalate matters beyond control.

“Is it Qin Yu?” Zhan Pu sensed the turmoil and bitterly mused to himself.

An earth-shattering power erupted from Qin Yu’s body, leaving even Jing Xin and Ling’er stunned.

In their perception, the strongest of these outsiders was only at the half-step of True Consciousness, but they hadn’t anticipated Qin Yu possessing such terrifying strength.

“Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze, detonate!”

The Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze on Qin Yu’s forehead opened its merciless eyes, unleashing a power capable of overturning the world from within his pupils.

Intense light radiated from his eyes, casting illumination across the entire surrounding area, rendering it impossible for onlookers to gaze directly at him.

This power was the pinnacle of pupil abilities that Qin Yu had acquired through his exploits in the Ancient Demon Land.

A visible wave of energy surged toward Roger and his companions like a tidal The air became saturated with a searing and dense energy, inducing feelings of suffocation and combustion.

“Not good! This power has already reached the depths of the True Consciousness Realm!” In the instant the power descended, he let out a horrified cry.

He and those behind him sought to flee, but it was too late.

“If you don’t want to die, stop immediately!”

A figure materialized behind Qin Yu, wielding a holy light divine flame in hand. It was Gu Tian, the individual Qin Yu, and the others had encountered before.

“I’ve said it before, today they shall meet their end!”

Detonate!

The power of the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze erupted completely. In an instant, the five disciples of the Demon Sealing Valley were utterly vaporized, leaving not even their bones behind.

“You insolent brat, you seek death!”

Gu Tian’s complexion changed drastically. He hadn’t anticipated Qin Yu continuing to attack despite his overwhelming presence.

Qin Yu showed no signs of holding back. With a light breath upon the holy light divine flame at his fingertip, a blade-like flame shot forth.

Simultaneously, a flame forged from divine energy pierced through Qin Yu’s body.

The force instantly engulfed him, threatening to consume his entire being.

“Saint Power! Mend!”

Qin Yu hastily ingested a handful of Pills, unleashing a torrent of Saint Power stored within his divine soul.

This violent and abundant energy worked to repair the damage inflicted by the holy light divine flame, causing Qin Yu’s skin to ignite with a power more terrifying than the Samadhi True Fire.

“What an astonishing physique. His reservoirs are far denser than we imagined.”

Jing Xin was taken aback by the sudden eruption of Saint Power. She hadn’t expected the young man to harbor such a formidable amount. Achieving such accumulation would have required the slaying of numerous powerful Ancient Demons.

The divine flame continued its onslaught against Qin Yu’s body.. As it neared his sea of consciousness, half of its power abruptly dissipated, vanishing into Qin Yu’s Nine Heavens Manifestations
