2119 The Peak Duel (2)

The air was full of suffocating tension as if facing a devastating disaster!

That shocking internal qi made people deeply feel the terrifying power of the living being and understand better the living being was no longer an existence they could imagine!

After that, the living being suddenly waved his hand. In that instant, the entire world trembled, the space began to distort, and a destructive power seemed to have suddenly erupted between heavens and earth. It was an indescribable power like a black hole that instantly devoured everything in the surroundings.

It was the living being’s attack. His power seemed to tear the entire world apart, and no one could escape!

At this moment, the entire world fell into chaos. It was an indescribable sense of fear. That powerful force seemed to be about to engulf the world and make everyone feel unprecedented fear!

It was a power beyond imagination, a power that could destroy everything. It was an unstoppable power!

At this very moment, everyone felt endless shock. They could not believe their eyes when they saw the earth-shattering change caused by the attack of the living being.

It was a scene of chaos, endless destruction, and indescribably terror.

At that moment, countless people felt a deep sense of powerlessness. They felt powerless to resist like ants in the face of such power!

The power of that strike was so terrifying that it was enough to destroy everything. The living being was like a god of creation. A gentle wave of his palm was enough to trigger the power of the end of the world!

The power surged toward Si Liuhe like a wave to annihilate him!

Under the impact of that power, the world seemed to be about to be torn apart. The clouds in the sky were instantly blown away, and the ground began to crack into deep canyons. The mountain range also instantly collapsed under this power!

Murderous internal qi filled the air. It was an endless sense of destruction as if the world was really going to be destroyed!

The living being’s attack was like shattering heavens and earth. Space could not maintain its stability under this power and began to distort and shatter crazily!

Si Liuhe raised his head and roared angrily, facing the living being’s powerful attack!

The scene behind him kept trembling. The trees welcomed new life, and the scene behind him became even more dazzling!

“Ah!” Si Liuhe shouted angrily as if he was resisting this attack with all his might!

His angry shout seemed to contain an incomprehensible power that was like coming from an ancient world, a mysterious power that had transcended time and space. A light gradually formed and surrounded Si Liuhe’s body. It was a golden light like a burning golden flame.

His hands slowly waved in the air like he was drawing an enormous symbol. The symbol flickered in the air as if it was alive. Each time it flickered, it would bring about a powerful fluctuation.

Then he suddenly pushed forward, and the symbol was instantly pushed toward the powerful force charging toward him.

The symbol collided with the power of the living being, and an intense light burst out. The light illuminated the entire world as if it was the only light left.

However, the power of that living being was too powerful. The symbol only lasted for a moment before it shattered and disappeared.

Si Liuhe pupils shrank. His feet trembled as he rushed out of the Chaos Grave.

Fortunately, his speed was tremendously fast, and he left the place instantly.

Even though scattered scars were on his body, they were harmless.

Although the living being was furious, he could not leave the sanctum. He could only watch Si Liuhe leave safely.

The scene was silent.

Although Si Liuhe had lost, everyone was shocked!

Everyone knew no one could defeat the living being. The fact that Si Liuhe could fight against him for a long time and escape unscathed explained Si Liuhe’s terrifying strength!

“Si Liuhe… is so strong.” Someone in the crowd took a deep breath and could not help but sigh with emotion.

Si Liuhe, who had become a True Saint, was indeed terrifying. His strength was far beyond that of an ordinary True Saint!

“As expected of Wu Ji’s sanctum. It’s indeed terrifying,” Si Liuhe said sincerely.

Wu Ji was a legend, and no one dared to disrespect him. Even the sanctum he left behind was not something people of the present age could touch.

Si Liuhe stood there for a long time. Then he slightly bowed to the sanctum and strode away.

Soon the news of this battle spread throughout the Holy Region.

“Have you heard? Si Liuhe challenged Wu Ji’s sanctum!”

“That’s right. He fought hundreds of rounds with the living being in the sanctum and didn’t lose! In the end, he left safely!”

“Are you kidding me?” one of them asked in disbelief. “Si Liuhe challenged the living being in Wu Ji’s sanctum and escaped unscathed?”

“It’s true. I saw it with my own eyes,” another person said with certainty and shock on his face. “The scale of that battle is beyond my imagination.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Oh my god! How could Si Liuhe be so powerful?” someone sighed with emotion and said, his face showing disbelief.

“Do you guys know? When he challenged the living being, he even used the symbol. However, the power of the living beings instantly shattered the symbol.” Someone revealed some details.

“Symbols?” Someone was puzzled. “What’s that?”

“It’s an ancient power. Rumor has it that it’s the only power that can fight against the living being. However, it couldn’t resist the power of that living being.” The person who explained said with a complicated expression. He seemed to be both impressed and worried about Si Liuhe’s actions.

“Why did Si Liuhe do that?” someone asked curiously. “What did he want to do by challenging the living being?”

“Who knows? Perhaps he wanted to challenge himself, or perhaps he wanted to obtain something from the living being,” someone guessed and said.

Everyone was discussing Si Liuhe’s actions.

They knew that regardless of Si Liuhe’s objective, he had already shown enough strength and courage.

However, some people guessed that Si Liuhe Liuhe was doing this to tell the world how terrifying he was after reaching the True Saint Realm!

“Si Liuhe… He’s probably going to Thunder Courtyard soon,” someone murmured as if he had already observed something.

In the Thunder Courtyard, Qin Yu and Dean Lei were playing chess.

Naturally, the news of Si Liuhe had also reached their ears.
