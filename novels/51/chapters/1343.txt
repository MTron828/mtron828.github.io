Chapter 1344: Chapter 1,344, I’ll fight for him 

Hearing this, Wen da suppressed his anger and said impatiently, “Stay away from me. Don’t force me to beat you up.”

“Beat me up? Are you going to beat me up, or is your grandfather going to beat me up?”Zhu Lan mocked.

The people around Zhu Lan immediately burst into laughter.

They all knew that the Wen brothers were nothing. They often used this to tease them.

“I don’t need my grandfather to beat you up. I can beat you up!”Wen da rolled up his sleeves and said.

Zhu Lan smiled faintly and said, “Oh? Really? I’ll just stand here and not move. Come and beat me up.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

After saying that, Zhu Lan really put his hands behind his back and looked at Wen Da and Wen Er provocatively.

“F * ck, you’re going too far!”Wen Da cursed and immediately clenched his fist and rushed over.

He clenched his fist and ruthlessly smashed it at Zhu Lan’s head. With a “Bang”sound, Zhu Lan was completely fine. However, this wen da “Deng Deng Deng Deng”took a few steps back.

“Hahaha!”

Zhu Lan and the others immediately burst into laughter. They looked at Wen Da and Wen Er, who were lying on the ground, with a face full of ridicule.

“Young Master Wen, I didn’t make a move. You Can’t blame me for this, right? I think even your grandfather can’t find me to settle the score because of this, right?”Zhu Lan said with a smile that was not a smile.

Wen da gritted his teeth and said, “Just you fucking wait!”

“Why? Are you going back to look for your grandfather?”Zhu Lan ridiculed.

Elder Wen’s face turned red and he didn’t know how to reply for a moment.

“Young Master Wen is right. Senior Wen doesn’t need to do anything to beat you up.”At this moment, Qin Yu walked out.

He slowly walked in front of Zhu Lan and said with a smile, “Your name is Zhu Lan, right?”

Zhu Lan frowned slightly and said somewhat unhappily, “It’s Zhu Lan.”

“Okay, Zhu Lan.”Qin Yu nodded slightly. “Zhu Lan, I’ll help Young Master Wen. How about it?”

Zhu Lan sized up Qin Yu and said, “Who are you? How come I’ve never seen you before?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I’m a newly recruited servant of the Wen family. I’m nobody. I’m not worth mentioning.”

Zhu Lan’s eyes narrowed slightly. He swept his gaze over Qin Yu’s body and thought to himself, “He is actually an ordinary person without any spiritual power?”

At the thought of this, Zhu Lan could not help but sneer.

“Alright. Since you want to help him, then I will satisfy you.”Zhu Lan put his hands behind his back and put on that arrogant posture once again.

Qin Yu did not waste any words. He walked in front of Zhu Lan and gently clenched his right fist. Golden Light slowly condensed.

In the next second, Qin Yu suddenly threw a punch at Zhu Lan’s chest.

With a bang, Zhu Lan’s chest was directly shattered, and his body was sent flying hundreds of meters away!

The faces of the people around him immediately changed. One of them even shouted, “Kid, are you courting death!”

Qin Yu sneered, “He was the one who asked me to make a move. What, Now You Want to blame me?”

Those people couldn’t care less about Qin Yu. They pointed at Qin Yu and said, “Just you wait. I’ll come back to settle the score with you later!”

After saying that, they hurriedly ran in the direction of Zhu Lan.

“Qin Yu, well done!”Wen Da and Wen Er said excitedly.

“I have long disliked this. If it weren’t for my grandfather not willing to take action against the younger generation, I would have killed him long ago!”Wen Da said in a huff.

“That’s right, that’s right. Now that Qin Yu is here, I can take care of these little bastards as I please in the future.”

As he spoke, Zhu Lan had already dashed over.

His entire body was covered in blood, and his entire body was dyed red.

There was even a huge bloody hole in his chest, and his ribs were all broken. It was a gruesome sight to behold.

Zhu Lan stared at Qin Yu and said coldly, “Brat, you actually dare to make a killing move?”

Qin Yu sneered, “I didn’t kill you. If I killed you, do you think you can still stand in front of me?”

“What big words!”The person beside Zhu Lan said coldly.

“You are so young, but you are so vicious. If I don’t Teach You a lesson, you will be a disaster in the future!”

“Kid, you cut off your own arms. We can consider forgiving you.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer when he heard that. “What nonsense are you spouting? Did the dog ask me to make a move just now? He just stood there and didn’t move. What does that have to do with me? Twisting black and white to stir up trouble. Is this your face?”

These people knew that they were in the wrong, so they simply took off their hypocritical masks.

The few of them looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “We were just joking with Young Master Wen, but you made such a deadly move. You must pay the price!”

“Pay the price of Your Grandpa!”Wen Er cursed loudly.

“That’s right, that’s right. Qin Yu, you don’t have to be afraid of him. If they dare to compete again, you can kill them all!”Wen Er also said.

Qin Yu looked at these few people coldly and said, “Whoever wants to make a move, feel free to do so.”

“You’re courting death!”One of them immediately rushed towards Qin Yu!

At this moment, Zhu Lan was frowning.

He had a feeling that he had heard of the name Qin Yu somewhere before.

“Qin Yu... HMM? Isn’t Qin Yu the person who killed Ling Yun with two punches a few days ago?”Zhu Lan suddenly recalled.

He hurriedly shouted, “Stop, come back quickly!”

However, it was already too late. Qin Yu’s Golden Fist was already heading straight for his head!
