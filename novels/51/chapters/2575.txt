“Especially that last flying feather clan. It’s just a step away from developing its consciousness.”

The three-hair old man stroked his head and asked somewhat curiously.

“You’re so long-winded. Can’t we just eat him up? The two of us can’t even defeat an individual who has just entered the Saint Kingdom?”

The alpaca gulped down the soil directly into its stomach.

“Let’s wait and see. I’m also not sure. Anyvvay, many living beings have entered the divine kingdom recently. Let’s find some safe food.”

The old man stroked his three strands of hair and shook his head.

They tracked Qin Yu for a distance, including witnessing the scene where he killed the flying creature.

This made the big-headed old man feel a little uneasy. This living being seemed not as easy to control as others.

In another place, three living beings of the demon race suddenly appeared on the spot.

Xiao Sheng also appeared near them. Compared to Qin Yu’s confusion, they had received some information from Immortal Crane, so they were much calmer when they first entered.

There were several sharp and hard bone spurs in his fists.

It was a simple boxing glove that he had made after coming here. Although it was crude, this boxing glove had given him a considerable increase in lethality. After entering this place, he had already killed nearly six natives.

“I’ve roughly figured out the rules. Killing these natives will give me holy energy, and the improved soul can strengthen a specific part of my body.” He stared at his right fist and slowly analyzed it.

He needed a lot of living beings’ holy energy before he could control and strengthen his body.

His current power of the soul was still too weak. However, killing these low-intelligence living beings was still not a problem. But he still had to be careful. According to the general rules here, if they encountered the natives who had existed for an incredibly long time, they would not be a match for them.

The design of the Saint Kingdom was relatively simple. It followed the law of the jungle that the strong preyed on the weak. The natives who could survive for a long time, even if it was just a holy energy attack alone, would reach a terrifying level. ‘

Among the three demon races, one of the griffins, Flaming Wing, revealed a ferocious expression.

Xiao Sheng raised his head slightly and stared at him expressionlessly.

“Lord Immortal Crane has said that once the demon race enters this place, we must first unite. From now on, I will be the leader here. Do you understand?”

This King of Griffin and the demonic ape clan often collaborated and made joint movements.

The demonic ape had died because of Xiao Sheng, so he naturally had to teach this kid a lesson. He had already made up his mind to let this human kid scout the way. After all, Lord Immortal Crane was not around.

“Didn’t you hear that, you dog of the human race?”

The griffin stomped on the ground, and its enormous body landed in front of Xiao Sheng.

The soul of the demon race was stronger than that of the human race. Therefore, the body’s power that it could control seemed stronger than that of Xiao Sheng.

Dragon Subduing Stance!

Xiao Sheng did not wait for him to continue. Instead, he punched the griffin’s throat with all his might.

This fist condensed with the holy energy gained from killing six natives. All of it strengthened his right arm.

With a single punch, blood instantly spurted out from his throat.

“Bang!”

Although Xiao Sheng’s attack was unexpected, the griffin reacted immediately. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Although it could only use the power it had just condensed, it had not forgotten its battle instincts.

Its wings were stuck in the ground, and its sharp legs landed fiercely on Xiao Sheng’s chest.

Xiao Sheng sneered and blocked the attack with his right fist.

Flaming Wing let out a furious roar. Its internal qi visibly weakened.

This fatal wound caused it to lose a large amount of blood in an instant.

It was completely different from the human world. Here, it was like an ordinary person and no longer had the abnormal recovery power of a demon king.

At this moment, as the blood from the massive wound on his throat flowed out, internal qi quickly became dispirited.

“Help!”

Flaming Wing roared in rage. Everything happened too quickly.

The two living beings of the demon race finally woke up from their dreams and attacked Xiao Sheng.

Xiao Sheng punched the ground again.

In a resounding tremor, dust and smoke reverberated through the air. It was only a slight vibration.

But the expressions of the other two living beings of the demon race changed drastically. They let out a sharp cry and fled.

After entering this place, they began to understand that they had just entered this Saint Kingdom and were only slightly better than these living beings who only had the battle instinct to fight.

Xiao Sheng made this vibration at this moment. If he were to attract a few more living beings, they would probably all be exterminated.

Even though Immortal Crane had ordered them to be united, they were still fleeing frantically, afraid of getting into trouble.

To be able to come here had been an unimaginable opportunity. No one was willing to have an unforeseen event at this time.

“Xiao Sheng, Lord Immortal Crane has asked us to join forces. If you kill me, how will you explain it to Lord Immortal Crane?”

If he died, he would completely disappear from this world, and there would be no trace of him left.

Dragon Subduing Stance.

Saint Xiao’s eyes were cold. He stomped the ground hard, and his body flew into the air.

His body spun rapidly in the air, and he spread his arms simultaneously like a dragon spreading its wings and flying.

With a powerful punch using the strength of his body, he completely smashed the griffin’s head.

Although he could not use any technique, his skill was not affected at all.

A surge of power entered Xiao Sheng’s soul, and his internal qi visibly increased.

This power was much more robust! His soul seemed to have absorbed some Saint power because of the divine flame.

Xiao Sheng felt that this power alone was almost equivalent to the total power he had obtained from killing six living beings.

He hesitated for a moment and then strengthened his arm again with the increased power of the soul.

Nothing ventured, nothing gained. In this region, mediocrity was bound to sink. Only by maximizing the strengthening of attack power could one progress faster, but it also became more perilous.

This rare sense of danger made Xiao Sheng’s body surge with a strong battle intent. He walked toward a living being nearby. At this moment, after absorbing the holy energy, his body was at its peak again.

Such a thing happened in all the major places of Saint Kingdom.

In less than a day following the entry of these people, the entire Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom was undergoing a tremendous change.

In another area, four figures were moving in the darkness.

“How is it? Do we join hands or act alone? We’re pitifully weak right now. We can’t even compare to the natives here. If we hadn’t happened to be together just now, we would have been wiped out.”

King Qin Guang looked at Xiao Hai with a bitter smile. They had just begun to understand the rules here..
