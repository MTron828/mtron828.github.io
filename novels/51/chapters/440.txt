A hint of craftiness flashed across Qin Yu’s eyes.

A plan surfaced.

Up ahead, the host was still clamoring about the rockery.

Qin Yu’s eyes were also fixed on the rockery.

“Are you interested in this rockery too?” Old Mister Yan asked.

Qin Yu glanced at Old Mister Yan and said, “This isn’t an ordinary rockery.”

“Oh really?” Old Mister Yan raised his eyebrows and signaled Qin Yu to continue.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “If I’m not mistaken, this is probably a magic artifact.”

And it wasn’t an ordinary magic artifact.

In other words, what the host said just now wasn’t a lie.

“The starting price is 100 million!” The host shouted.

Such a high price scared many people away.

However, this was Sea City after all, and there were countless rich people here.

100 million for good luck was worth it for the rich.

The price rose all the way, and in the blink of an eye, it went from 100 million to 1 billion.

Countless people started to retreat. After all, 1 billion wasn’t a small amount to anyone.

“1.1 billion.” Qin Yu stretched out his hand and shouted.

Everyone’s gaze immediately turned towards Qin Yu.

They felt that this young face was rather unfamiliar to them.

“2 billion.” At this moment, a big-bellied rich man stretched out his hand.

Everyone couldn’t help but gasp.

2 billion?

Qin Yu’s brows also furrowed. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qin Yu really couldn’t afford two billion.

But this rockery... Was a magic artifact, and not an ordinary magic artifact!

To increase strength, in addition to one’s own realm, external weapons were also important.

And a quality magic artifact could increase one’s strength by a level!

“You really want this rockery?” Old Mister Yan asked.

Qin Yu explained, “If I’m not mistaken, this is probably an Earth Rank high-grade magic artifact.”

Earth Rank high-grade magic artifact!

It was only a step away from the Divine Rank!

And the Divine Rank had not appeared in the world for a long time. An Earth Rank high-grade magic artifact was enough to shake the whole country!

“What, you’re not bidding anymore?” The big-bellied man in the front row said indifferently.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything, as if he was weighing the pros and cons.

“If you want it, just bid,” Old Mister Yan said.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No, I can’t show too much enthusiasm.”

After all, Qin Yu wasn’t the only martial artist on this cruise ship.

If he attracted Meng Wuxiong or He Teng’s attention, it wouldn’t be worth it.

“Do you have the ability to challenge me? You nobody.” The big-bellied man snorted.

“He seems to be that martial artist called Qin Yu.” Someone recognized Qin Yu.

“Oh, so he is a martial artist. Someone like him is only fit to be my bodyguard.” The big-bellied man said with some contempt.

“Kid, how did you get in?” The big-bellied man stood up and said to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu ignored him and said indifferently, “My luck has been bad recently, so I wanted to use this opportunity to change my luck. Since you are interested, I will give up.”

The big-bellied man snorted and said, “At least you know your place!”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He pulled Old Mister Yan and said, “Let’s go.”

After leaving the auction, Old Mister Yan asked in a deep voice, “What do you plan to do?”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said coldly, “If it’s possible... kill people and steal their goods.”

Brightheart Island was very far from Sea City.

Killing people there would not be noticed.

Of course, this was the worst case scenario. If there was another way, Qin Yu would not choose to kill the big-bellied man.

...

In one of the private rooms on the cruise ship, the entire private room was pitch black.

A young man was sitting cross-legged on the bed. His eyes were flickering with a demonic light. At a glance, it was extremely terrifying.

This young man was none other than the number one among the young generation of the Central Plains, He Teng!

“Dragon Spirit... I must get it...” an extremely strange voice was emitted from He Teng’s body.

This voice was hoarse and terrifying!

He Teng said coldly, “If I get the Dragon Spirit, I can step into the half-step Martial Marquis Realm?”

“That’s right... I can even let you step into the true martial Marquis Realm!” That hoarse voice sounded again!

A trace of madness flashed in He Teng’s eyes!

True Martial Marquis Realm!

After he stepped into this realm, the aristocratic families wouldn’t even be worth mentioning!

At that time, who else in the world would he fear?

“That kid called Qin Yu... won’t mess things up, right?” The hoarse voice asked coldly.

He Teng snickered. “Not to mention that he’s already crippled, but even if he’s not crippled, I can still kill him.”

“Moreover... he also swallowed Spirit Pills.” He Teng changed the topic.

Hearing this, the hoarse voice sneered/ “Two Spirit Pills... will definitely draw out the Dragon Spirit.”

“Just wait and see,” He Teng said with narrowed eyes.

“When I get the Dragon Spirit, I want everyone on this ship to bow down to me!”

...

The cruise slowly sailed on the sea.

Three days later, they finally arrived at Brightheart Island.

Brightheart Island was very large, and the scenery was full of natural beauty.

Although there weren’t many entertainment facilities, it made people feel extremely comfortable.

“What’s with this comfortable feeling?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

Qin Yu carefully felt it. It wasn’t spiritual energy, but rather... an extremely ancient internal qi.

Qin Yu tried to absorb this internal qi, but he found that this internal qi was incompatible with his physical body and couldn’t be absorbed into his body at all.

“Weird.” Fang Yue nodded beside him.

Qin Yu glanced at Fang Yue and said, “You also felt it?”

Fang Yue nodded and said, “Yes.”

“Mr. Qin, Miss Fang, what’s wrong?” At this moment, He Teng walked over.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Nothing.”

He Teng chuckled and said, “There has always been a legend on Brightheart Island. I don’t know if you two have heard of it.”

Qin Yu looked at He Teng and waited for him to continue.

He Teng said aloofly, “It is said that there was a real Divine Dragon on Brightheart Island back then, and unfortunately, this Divine Dragon died. Its body turned into a small island, which is now Brightheart Island.”

“Legend has it that as long as you attain enlightenment on Brightheart Island, you will be invincible in the world.”

“More importantly, the Dragon Spirit of the Divine Dragon is here. The person who obtains the Dragon Spirit will have the power of the Divine Dragon.”
