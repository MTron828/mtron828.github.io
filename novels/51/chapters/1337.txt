Chapter 1338: Chapter 1338, Temple of No Fate 1 

At this moment, wan ‘er suggested, “Why don’t you come back to the Zhao family with me?”

“Why should I go to the Zhao Family?”Qin Yu shook his head.

Wan ‘er smiled and said, “Maybe I can ask them to help me find the Qi of life?”

“Do you think it’s possible?”Qin Yu shook his head and said, “If they could find the Qi of life, would they need you to go through so much trouble to come to Yang City?”

Wan ‘er seemed to think that what he said made sense, so she stopped insisting.

“By the way, do you know where there is a channel for the life qi?”Qin Yu asked.

Wan ‘er shook her head and said, “Unfortunately, what I know now is only Yang City.”

“Well, if there is any news in the future, please do tell me,”Qin Yu cupped his hands and said.

“Of course,”Wan ‘er also agreed.

At this moment, ah San at the side suggested, “Why don’t you take advantage of this opportunity to openly recruit life force?”

“That’s right. With your current influence, you should be willing to have people invest in you, right?”Wan ‘er also said.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Difficult. In the South Province, the Heavenly Cloud sect doesn’t say that they can cover the sky with one hand, but it’s almost enough. Who Dares to approach me? What I should be thinking about now is how to protect my life.”

If he couldn’t even protect his life, then the life force would be meaningless.

“Miss Wan ‘er, I think we should part ways here. If you continue to stay with me, I’m afraid you’ll be in danger,”said Qin Yu. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Wan ‘er smiled and said, “Young Master Qin, then we’ll meet again in the future.”

“We’ll meet again in the future,”Qin Yu also nodded and said.

The two sides parted here and there. No one knew when they would meet again.

Qin Yu found his wind chasing colt and planned to leave Yang City.

“Qin Yu.”

At this moment, a familiar voice sounded behind Qin Yu.

He turned around and saw that it was none other than Chen Cang.

“Old Mister Chen? Why are you here?”Qin Yu asked in surprise.

Chen Cang walked up to Qin Yu and asked in a deep voice, “Are you planning to leave?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I’ve found the aura of life. It’s time to leave.”

Chen Cang nodded and slowly took out a small jar.

This jar was beautifully packaged, and it was shining with light.

“Take it,”Chen Cang said reluctantly.

Qin Yu took the jar and asked in surprise, “This is?”

“Life Qi,”Chen Cang said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu was immediately shocked. He hurriedly put the jar back and shook his head, “Mr. Chen, this is too valuable. I Can’t take it.”

Chen Cang rolled his eyes and said, “Didn’t you always want to take this life Qi from me when you came here? Why Did You Change Your Mind Now?”

Qin Yu laughed bitterly, “Before this, I didn’t know how precious this life Qi was. Ever since I entered that mountain range, I realized that to you, this life qi is probably a gift of life. It’s not good for me to take away someone’s love.”

“Alright, although I really can’t bear to part with it, this thing is more important to you. Take it.”Chen Cang once again stuffed the jar into Qin Yu’s hand.

Qin Yu held the jar and was at a loss for a moment.

“Old Mr. Chen, do you have any conditions?”Qin Yu asked a moment later.

Chen Cang opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something. Then, he waved his hand and said, “No conditions. Hurry up and leave.”

“Old Mr. Chen, if you have something to say, just say it. I Won’t refuse if I can do it,”Qin Yu continued.

Chen Cang did not say anything. He just waved his hand and slowly left the place.

Qin Yu put away the jar. He sat on the wind chasing stallion and prepared to leave Yang City.

In reality, Qin Yu did not know where to go at all.

He said that he was going to Gu City, but even a fool knew that Gu city was probably now a part of the Heavenly Cloud Sect. How could he go back.

I can only take it one step at a time. Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh in his heart.

The last time he fought with the first Elder’s shadow, Qin Yu felt a trace of pressure.

It was only a shadow, but it made Qin Yu retreat several steps. If his real body came, Qin Yu probably wouldn’t be able to fight back at all.

“I wonder where Chang Mang and the others are,”Qin Yu muttered.

Qin Yu had arrived a year later than Chang Mang and the others. With Chang Mang and the others’talent, no one knew how much progress they would make in a year.

“It would be great if we could find them,”Qin Yu sighed.

Although the news of Qin Yu killing Ling Yun spread very quickly, it was only limited to South Province.

If they were to leave South Province, no one would know about this.

If I really can’t, I have to consider leaving South Province, Qin Yu thought to himself.

After hesitating for a long time, Qin Yu finally decided to temporarily go near the hunter organization and wait for an opportunity to make a move.

There were two reasons. The first was that the hunter organization was very close to Gu City, so it was convenient to observe the situation in Gu City and gather information.

The second reason was that the flying spiders in the Green Rock Forest had a life force.

There was only one reason why he didn’t directly return to the hunter organization, and that was the existence of Zhong Wu.

If he knew of Qin Yu’s whereabouts, he would definitely report the news to the Heavenly Cloud sect.

“If not for the white bone scepter in his hand, I would have killed him long ago.”Qin Yu could not help but sigh.

After a few days of traveling, Qin Yu finally arrived near the hunter organization.

This was a small mountain. On the mountain, there was a temple called the temple of no fate.

The location of the temple of no fate was extremely unique. It was right in the middle of the hunter organization and Gu City.

And this mountain was extremely high. Standing on the peak of this mountain, coupled with Qin Yu’s desolate divine eyes, one could see the flow of people in the middle.

Qin Yu climbed all the way to the peak of the mountain and entered the temple of no fate.

There were only three to five monks in the temple. They did not have much of a reaction to Qin Yu’s sudden arrival. They just took a glance and did whatever they wanted.

“You are Qin Yu, right?”

Qin Yu was just about to speak when a monk spoke indifferently.

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed.

He took two steps back warily and curled his right fist. Squinting his eyes, he said, “Who are you? Why do you know me?”

“The Heavenly Cloud Sect’s wanted posters are everywhere. I think it’s hard not to know,”the monk slowly stood up and said.

Qin Yu looked at the monk. This monk looked extremely ordinary. Even if he shaved his head, he would not stand out in the crowd at all.

“Don’t worry. I Won’t expose you,”the monk said indifferently.

Qin Yu’s expression became even colder.

His previous trust had been exchanged for betrayal. How Could Qin Yu trust him now.

Qin Yu Heart Ice-cold, body also involuntarily emitted a killing intent.
