1924 Go Too Far

Hearing what Qin Yu said, both Saintess Gu and Yao Tianqian laughed.

“Mr. Qin, I can understand how you feel. I can also understand the relationship between you and Chang Mang. However, I don’t want you to be such a childish person,” Saintess Gu said somewhat directly.

“Exchange? Exchange yourself for Chang Mang? Who are you to negotiate with them?” Saintess Gu shook her head.

“That’s right. Mr. Qin, it’s not realistic for you to exchange yourself for Chang Mang,” Yao Tianqiang agreed and said by the side.

After hearing what they said, Qin Yu calmed down.

He said in a deep voice, “Then what should I do? Saintess Gu, can you help?”

“Since Mr. Qin has asked, I have to try. Moreover, the incident happened in my Cold Moon Palace. I am also responsible for it,” Saintess said.

“Thank you very much,” Qin Yu cupped his hands and said.

“We shouldn’t delay the matter. The longer the stay in the Skywater Prison, the greater the risk is. I’ll leave now,” Saintess Gu said.

Although Saintess Gu agreed to help, Qin Yu didn’t have much hope in his heart.

Yan Ruoxue would never lie to him. She would not keep Qin Yu waiting with a glimmer of hope.

After Saintess Gu left, Yao Tianqian did not stay any longer. Soon he left the Cold Moon Palace, while Qin Yu chose to sit under the Osmanthus tree.

Yao Tianqian and Saintess Gu were right. Qin Yu was still easily irritable and impulsive, which could readily affect his dao mind. Therefore, with such a state of mind, he planned to cultivate.

After a long time, Saintess Gu finally returned to the Cold Moon Palace.

As expected, the news she brought back was the same as Yan Ruoxue’s. The Holy Lord wasn’t around, and no one could open the Skywater Prison. They could only wait.

Although Qin Yu was incomparably anxious, there was nothing he could do.

Right now, Qin Yu couldn’t afford to challenge the Si family.

After bidding goodbye to Saintess Gu, Qin Yu left the Cold Moon Palace and went to Serene South City alone.

Serene South City was a massive city. Qin Yu also found out unintentionally that it belonged to the Si family!

In other words, this place probably wasn’t too far from the Si family.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and murmured, “I’m afraid there’s an unspeakable destined encounter imperceptibly between the Si family and me.”

After cultivating for a long time, Qin Yu began to believe in the saying “Everything is written in the stars.” Everything seemed to have been arranged. For example, the day of the Path of Heaven was the direction of heaven’s will, and no one could change it. No matter how hard you tried, it was rare to find someone who could change his fate.

After enjoying tea in the teahouse for a while, Qin Yu got up and planned to leave the place.

He came to the main street of Serene South City and decided to search for the hidden treasure based on his memory.

According to the memory in his mind, Qin Yu came to a somewhat deserted mine.

The mine was obviously unmined and looked a little barren.

Qin Yu could see a hint of the heavenly secret through his desolate divine eye. At the same time, he could tell the mine did not worth much.

Perhaps this was why the great aristocratic families did not occupy the mine. Only a few scattered rogue cultivators were excavating something.

These rogue cultivators were in ragged clothes, and their internal qi was not strong. He could even see a few gray-haired elderly men.

Qin Yu sighed slightly. After some thought, he finally decided to wait by the side. He would look for the hidden treasure after they finished mining to avoid disturbing them.

He retracted his internal qi and sat on a pile of rocks with his eyes closed. He tried to comprehend the dao of heaven and earth to improve his cultivation.

Not knowing the time taken, Qin Yu’s divine sense seemed to have merged with the Great Dao. He greedily absorbed and comprehended it.

It was a kind of cultivation, a kind of selfless cultivation. Qin Yu was like being isolated from the world. He had never been in such a wonderful state before.

While Qin Yu was exploring the dao techniques, a series of arguments woke him up.

Feeling upset, he opened his eyes and was about to flare up when he realized many more people in the mine now. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Compared to the miners earlier, these people looked much nobler, and their internal qi was more tyrannical. They seemed to be from an aristocratic family.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and looked in the direction of the quarrel.

A man with a big belly was pointing at the mine and said arrogantly, “This place belongs to our Yue family! Do you think you can simply leave after excavating our mine?”

“Big Brother, we had asked around before we came here. This is an abandoned mine, and no one wants it!” an elderly man said in a trembling voice.

“How about we give you all the mines we excavated and never come back again? Are you okay with it?” another elderly man walked out and said.

The big-bellied man in the lead couldn’t help but sneer and say, “You steal our things and just return them to me. Will this matter be over just like this? You must be dreaming!”

“Then what do you want?” a slightly stronger young cultivator stepped forward and asked.

The big-bellied man sneered and said, “Don’t you like to mine?” Fine, I’ll let you mine until you get enough. When you’re done, I’ll let you go. How about it?”

“You’re dreaming! You want us to work for you for free!” a young cultivator said angrily.

The big-bellied man narrowed his eyes, sneered, and said, “Since you’ve seen through it, I won’t waste any more time. Start digging. When you’re done, you can get lost!”

“Why should we?” the young cultivator shouted.

“Why should you?” The big-bellied man’s expression turned cold. He suddenly shook his palm and slammed it on the young cultivator’s chest!

The palm was so powerful that the young cultivator was knocked back several steps and spat out a mouthful of blood!

“Just because we’re from the Yue family!” the big-bellied man said with a cold face.

The miners’ faces grew uglier. They looked at each other, not knowing what to do.

“A warrior can be killed, but not humiliated! I will never bow to evil forces like you!” Another young man stood out at this point.

“That’s right! We won’t agree to it!” The rest of the people followed suit.

The big-bellied man’s face darkened. He snorted and said, “In that case, all of you can go to hell.”

After saying that, the big-bellied man waved his palm and hit it hard at a cultivator’s forehead!

...

“Boom!”

At this moment, a beam of golden light flashed and directly sent the big-bellied man flying!

“Who’ is it?” the big-bellied man’s expression changed as he shouted in panic.

Qin Yu looked at the big-bellied man coldly and said, “Don’t go too far. Their cultivation path is already tough enough. Why do you want to take away their last bit of hope? “
