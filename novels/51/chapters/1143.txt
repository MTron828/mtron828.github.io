Chapter 1144: Chapter 1,144, the inheritance of the immortal slaying sect

Qin Yu had always been curious about Tian Jizi.

He seemed to know everything, and many of the news came even earlier than the higher-ups.

“We’ll set off early tomorrow morning,”Yao Meng said.

Among these people, only Yao Meng seemed to know the location of Tian Jizi. Apart from him, Zhuang Teng and the others knew nothing about it.

Obviously, Yao Meng’s background was not as ordinary as it seemed.

Each of these heaven’s favorites seemed to have a secret.

At night.

Qin Yu sat on a cliff in the second mystic realm, looking up at the full moon.

The moon shone on Qin Yu’s face, illuminating his face that was as sharp as a knife.

He held a pot of wine in his hand. This pot of wine was brought out of the demon city. Even martial artists would get drunk.

Qin Yu had too many vexing things in his heart. Ever since he stepped into the path of cultivation, he had not had a good rest for almost a day.

An invisible pressure was like a big hand pushing Qin Yu forward.

And the help that his beloved had brought Qin Yu made him even more afraid to take a moment to rest.

“What’s wrong? Are you thinking about Miss Yan?”

At this moment, a voice came from behind.

Turning around, he saw Chu Hedao slowly walking over.

He was the youngest among the group, and there was still a hint of youth on his face.

Qin Yu shook his head and said with a bitter smile, “I’m just imagining things.”

Chu Hedao sat beside Qin Yu and asked casually, “Can you give me a sip?”

Qin Yi handed the wine in her hand to Chu Hedao.

Chu Hedao took the wine and gulped it down. He smiled and said, “Good wine.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He looked at the sky and couldn’t help but sigh.

“When the Holy Region Opens, you will be able to meet Miss Yan,”Chu Hedao joked.

Qin Yu sighed and said, “I hope so. She and I... have been apart for too long.”

Although the two of them were lovers, they had very little time together.

This caused the longing in Qin Yu’s heart to intensify.

“Mr. Qin, what do you want to ask Tianji Zi Tomorrow?”At this moment, Chu Hedao suddenly asked.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment before he slowly replied, “There’s too much. I want to know my background, my father, my mother, the Yan family of the Holy Region, the time when the Holy Region will open, the eighteen array platforms...”

There were too many questions in Qin Yu’s mind.

“What About You?”Qin Yu asked back.

“Me?”Chu Hedao smiled, then he looked at the sky and said, “I’m different from you. The principle I follow has always been to take one step at a time. As for the future, it has nothing to do with the current me.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but be surprised when he heard that.

Chu Hedao was at most twenty-five or twenty-six years old, but he had such a free and easy personality. It was really surprising.

“I want to know one question right now,”Chu Hedao said in a deep voice.

At this point, Chu Hedao looked at Qin Yu and said coldly, “According to the latest news I received, many people were forcibly swallowed, including a holy body.”

“Holy Body?”Qin Yu’s heart thumped.

Wasn’t that the same constitution as Chang Mang and the current Jiang Gu?

“Other than special constitutions, there are many people who died suddenly. These people have a common characteristic, which is that they are more or less contaminated with different bloodlines,”Chu Hedao said coldly.

“This method is the inheritance technique of the immortal slaying sect.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Qin Yu stared at Chu Hedao, waiting for him to continue.

“I want to know if the person who did this is a sky blood rainbow. If so, where is he?”Chu Hedao’s tone was filled with coldness.

Qin Yu looked at Chu Hedao in surprise and said, “Why are you so concerned about this matter?”

Chu Hedao smiled bitterly and said, “I have a deep understanding of the immortal slaying sect. This sect is extremely vicious. If their successor appears, we must eliminate him as soon as possible.”

“Otherwise, that successor will be invincible in the world. At that time, it will be a disaster for everyone.”

Qin Yu said jokingly, “Just now, you said you wouldn’t consider the future.”

“It’s not the same.”Chu Hedao smiled bitterly. “I read the family history and once saw that many people in my group died under this kind of spell. No one escaped.”

“I see.”Qin Yu came to a sudden realization and then signaled Chu Hedao to continue.

Chu Hedao said in a deep voice, “The most terrifying part of this spell is that it can turn the opponent’s bloodline power into its own use. Once it is mastered, no one is his match.”

With that, Chu Hedao began to read through the history:

As the number one sect in the world, the Immortal Slayer sect naturally ran amok for many years.

The first sect leader had once killed more than ten special physiques, including the chaotic body and the holy body.

The second sect leader had even killed a top-tier bloodline inheritor.

The third, the fourth... A total of eight sect leaders could be said to be the number one person in the world.

Once they reached the great success stage, they would slaughter the cultivators. The first to suffer would definitely be the special physiques.

“Do you know, back then, a chaotic body didn’t last more than five minutes under the third cult master?”Chu Hui Dao said in a deep voice.

“A chaotic body is so weak under the same realm. This means that you should know how powerful this technique is.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but be surprised when he heard this.

Qin Yu himself was a chaotic body. Of course, he knew how terrifying a chaotic body was!

That was a physique that was said to be unrivalled among those of the same level! ! He couldn’t even last five minutes? !

“I still have a lot of things to do. I have to clean up before I step into the saint-level,”Chu Hedao said coldly.

“If I step into the saint-level, I’m afraid that something might happen to my family.”
