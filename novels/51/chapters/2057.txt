2058 The True Saint!

Seeing this elderly man, Holy Lord Si smiled and said, “A mere junior is not worth mentioning.”

“From what Holy Lord is saying, does Holy Lord intend to let him go?” someone asked.

Holy Lord Si didn’t answer this question and just looked in Qin Yu’s direction.

His eyes were cold, and he had already made his stand clear.

However, Holy Holy Si didn’t have any intention of attacking. He just casually glanced at him.

Qin Yu naturally felt this chill. He took a deep breath, and his expression was slightly nervous.

Although it was only a clone and it was alright to lose it, Qin Yu was reluctant to “die” here so soon.

The purpose of this trip here was to listen to the views of the nine great aristocratic families on the Chaos Grave. If he died here, it would be a loss.

Fortunately, Holy Lord Si did not pay attention to Qin Yu. He sat with the others and seemed to be discussing something.

Soon, all the cultivators arrived. The various aristocratic families also sent their top-notch experts.

The atmosphere quickly quieted down.

Countless people looked straight before them, waiting for the Holy Lord of the Si family to speak.

After some time, Holy Lord Ji slowly stood up.

He looked around and said indifferently, “Our aristocratic families are unwilling to dominate the Chaos Grave. Wu Ji is an indispensable part of the entire history of cultivation. Everyone has the opportunity and the right to obtain the opportunities they deserve.”

The words were quite bold with the big picture, but Qin Yu scoffed in his heart.

“Pure nonsense! You’re putting on an act,” Qin Yu cursed in his heart.

The Holy Lord of the Si family continued, “Therefore, we are willing to announce the secret news of the Chaos Grave and the method to enter it. As for whether you are capable or not, it will depend on your luck.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Everyone present was a little nervous. They perked up their ears to listen, afraid they would miss something.

“Perhaps you’re not aware, Wu Ji didn’t create the terrifying Forbidden Zone in the Chaos Grave but his two attendants,” the Holy Lord said.

“Therefore, if you want to enter the Chaos Grave, you must bring along the supreme bone which came from the bodies of the two attendants.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath. It was as expected.

Qin Yu’s true body, which was far away, could not help but tremble slightly. There was a faint excitement in his heart.

Holy Lord Ji continued, “Other than the supreme bone, you also need the tribulation path inscription and the chaotic blood. If anyone here has the supreme bone, the Si family is willing to exchange it with the chaotic blood.”

Qin Yu was silent. He now understood the purpose of the nine great aristocratic families holding this grand event.

“No wonder it’s open to everybody. They actually want to obtain the supreme bone,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Judging from the tone of the Holy Lord of the Si family, it seemed that only one piece of supreme bone, not a complete corpse, was needed to enter the Chaos Grave.

If this supreme bone were in the hands of others, they would definitely proceed to exchange it for the chaotic blood. After all, without the chaotic blood, it was meaningless to have the supreme bone.

Unfortunately, the supreme bone was in Qin Yu’s hands. Thus he didn’t need the chaotic blood from Si Shiyue.

“May I ask Holy Lord Si, do we need any other treasures other than the items you mentioned?” a cultivator asked at this moment.

It was exactly what Qin Yu wanted to know.

Holy Lord Si looked at him and said, “Of course, you must have formidable strength and a tribulation magical artifact. If you have the protection of a tribulation magical artifact, it might be much easier. However, it doesn’t mean it’s risk-free.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

A tribulation magical artifact? It was simply impossible to obtain this item. A tribulation magical artifact was sufficient to contend against an aristocratic family.

“Tribulation magical artifact? This condition itself has already isolated us!”

“That’s right. How would rogue cultivators like us have tribulation magical artifacts?”

Holy Lord Si smiled and said, “According to our speculations, this supreme bone has long been scattered everywhere. If someone obtains the supreme bone and is willing to exchange it with us, we are willing to bring him into the Chaos Grave and ensure his safety.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief.

Scattered everywhere? It was pure nonsense!

All the supreme bones were in Qin Yu’s hands! Qin Yu had even crushed a piece of it!

There was a lot of discussion in the scene, but no one took out the supreme bone.

Holy Lord Si didn’t seem to be in a hurry. He smiled and said, “I know. Maybe you don’t have the supreme bone, but it doesn’t matter. The Si family is now offering a reward. As long as you can find the supreme bone, the Si family is willing to fulfill a condition you set. Any condition is acceptable.”

“Any condition? What if I exchange it for a tribulation magical artifact?” someone asked.

“Of course, you can,” Holy Lord Si said calmly. “Our Si family isn’t very strong, but several tribulation magical artifacts are nothing to us.”

Qin Yu rubbed his chin.

This was a good opportunity.

Wouldn’t he have everything if he could get a tribulation magical artifact from the Si family?

After all, Qin Yu had numerous supreme bones in his hands.

“Of course, if you don’t want to trade, we won’t force you. After all, entering the Chaos Grave doesn’t necessarily require the supreme bone,” Holy Lord Si changed his words and his face turned cold.

He glanced at everyone and said indifferently, “At most, we can bring our supreme artifact and forcefully attack the Chaos Grave!”

Supreme artifact!

It was a magical artifact left behind by the Immortal Emperor!

The ancestors of the nine great aristocratic families all once had an Immortal Emperor. They must have had a supreme artifact in their hands!

Everyone was instantly shocked!

“A supreme artifact! It hasn’t appeared for many years!”

“Although Lord Wu Ji is powerful, he is not an Immortal Emperor. Moreover, the terrifying scene in the Chaos Grave was not created by him. In front of a supreme artifact, I’m afraid he also can’t resist! ”

“That’s right. If the nine great aristocratic families all bring along their supreme artifacts, perhaps they really don’t need the supreme bone!”

Qin Yu did not panic.

Holy Lord Si mentioned it casually, but Qin Yu didn’t believe it at all.

They would have long brought their supreme artifacts to attack the Chaos Grave if it was that simple. As long as they could obtain the Traceless Immortal Scripture, it would be worth it even if they had to destroy a supreme artifact!

“Using both kindness and coercion, I already used this trick ten years ago.” Qin Yu snorted coldly in his heart.

“I don’t think so.”

At this moment, a powerful internal qi suddenly descended! Voices even came from all directions!

This internal qi was so terrifying that it made people’s hair stand on end! Countless people submitted to this pressure!

This internal qi… was a True Saint!

A True Saint had descended! This grand event actually received a True Saint!
