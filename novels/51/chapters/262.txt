Chapter 263: Serial Pervert Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Yang Zhao was quite pleased with himself that night, so he drank quite a bit.

After leaving the house, he was even more disoriented.

He went alone to the underground garage. Just as he was about to drive home, he felt a chill down his spine.

Yang Zhao subconsciously turned around and saw a creepy old man sitting behind him.

“Ah!”

Yang Zhao was so scared that his whole body trembled. He instantly sobered up!

The old man raised his hand and pressed on Yang Zhao’s shoulder. The huge force made Yang Zhao unable to move!

“Sir... I’ll give you as much money as you want. Don’t kill me...” Yang Zhao was so scared that he almost peed his pants.

The old man looked at Yang Zhao sinisterly and then poked his head over.

A strong stench of bad breath immediately assailed Yang Zhao’s nostrils.

This made Yang Zhao, who was already drunk, almost spit out.

“The Earth Fiend Valley has taken a liking to Xiao Yu. You... can’t touch her...” the old man said gloomily.

Yang Zhao was stunned.

This old man actually took a liking to Xiao Yu?

And what was the Earth Fiend Valley he was talking about? What was that?

“I want you to take her to a deserted place after the competition tomorrow, and then hand her over to me...” the old man said in Yang Zhao’s ear.

Although Yang Zhao coveted Xiao Yu’s body, under such circumstances, how could he have the courage to refuse?

“Okay. Don’t worry, I’ll definitely do it!” Yang Zhao hurriedly nodded.

Although he said yes, Yang Zhao was sneering inside.

After he ran away, he could just find someone to arrest him!

As for Xiao Yu, she was his! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Obviously, the old man had guessed what he was thinking.

The old man stretched out his finger, and a sinister head appeared in front of Yang Zhao.

Seeing this scene, Yang Zhao was so scared that he almost fainted, and he wet his pants.

“You better do as I say, or else... I will make your life worse than death!” The old man shouted shrilly.

Yang Zhao was scared out of his wits. He covered his eyes and shouted desperately, “Definitely, definitely!”

After this, there was no more movement from the backseat.

Yang Zhao mustered up his courage and looked back.

He saw that there was no one in the backseat.

Yang Zhao wiped the sweat off his forehead and said with lingering fear, “What is that thing? It’s too terrifying...”

...

The next day, Gu Taichu didn’t show up, which gradually made Qin Yu lower his guard.

However, he still didn’t remove the formation. After all, Qin Yu had to be on guard against a top-notch martial artist like Gu Taichu.

On this day, Qin Yu took Yao Qing out to the herbs market to buy a batch of herbs to grow in Bai City.

Coincidentally, not long after Qin Yu and Yao Qing left the house, they bumped into Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi.

“Xiao Yu? Where are you going?” Qin Yu greeted Xiao Yu.

Xiao Yu said in surprise, “What a coincidence! I didn’t expect you to be here!”

Xiao Mi said disdainfully, “Some people really don’t act like men.”

Xiao Mi kept staring at Qin Yu when she said this.

This made Qin Yu a little puzzled. He couldn’t help but frown and said, “Are you talking about me?”

“Who else can I be talking about if not you?” Xiao Mi snorted.

“Xiao Yu...”

“Okay, stop talking.” Xiao Mi was about to speak, but was interrupted by Xiao Yu.

Then, Xiao Yu hurriedly said goodbye to Qin Yu and ran away with Xiao Mi.

Seeing their expressions, Qin Yu was confused.

“I don’t think I provoked her...” Qin Yu scratched his head.

“Who can guess a little girl’s thoughts?” Yao Qing mumbled.

He went to the herbs market and bought a sack full of herbs. When he went home, the sky had darkened.

After sealing up these herbs, Qin Yu went back to his bedroom and took out the Divine Medicine.

‘Since Gu Taichu hasn’t come yet, I should consider going into seclusion,’ Qin Yu thought to himself.

With this Divine Medicine, Qin Yu was prepared to try to break through to the Monastic Stage.

As long as he entered the Monastic Stage, Qin Yu was confident that he wouldn’t be afraid of any Inner Strength Grandmaster, even a young master like Han Wei.

After thinking about it, Qin Yu decided to go back to Jiangcheng and go into seclusion.

There were too many people in the provincial capital, so it was easy to attract unnecessary trouble.

Just as Qin Yu was thinking, his phone suddenly rang.

He picked up the phone and saw that the caller was an unfamiliar number.

“Hello?” After picking up the phone, Qin Yu called out tentatively.

The other party scolded, “Qin Yu, you really aren’t a man! Because of you, Xiao Yu offended Yang Zhao. Don’t you know?!”

Her voice seemed to be Xiao Mi’s.

However, what she said made Qin Yu somewhat puzzled.

If there was the real reason, wasn’t it still because of Xiao Mi?

“What do you mean?” Qin Yu frowned.

Xiao Mi gnashed her teeth and said, “Yang Zhao wanted to race with you. Since you didn’t agree, Xiao Yu personally competed with Yang Zhao.”

“In the end, Yang Zhao deliberately rammed her car on the track. Now, Xiao Yu is already in a coma!” Xiao Mi gnashed her teeth and said.

“Let me tell you, Xiao Yu promised Yang Zhao that as long as he lost, she would do whatever Yang Zhao wanted her to. Yang Zhao is a pervert, so you can guess what will happen!”

After saying that, Xiao Mi directly hung up the phone.

Qin Yu frowned. After thinking for a while, he searched the nearby car track and then drove away.

Yang Zhao was famous for playing dirty on the track. Most of the drivers who competed with him wouldn’t get off the track unscathed.

The inexperienced Xiao Yu had her car forcibly flipped by Yang Zhao.

In the car, Xiao Yu was in a coma with multiple injuries.

“Don’t worry, I’ll send her to the hospital right away.” Yang Zhao pretended to be righteous.

“Yang Zhao, if anything happens to Xiao Yu, I won’t let you off the hook!” Xiao Mi said angrily.

Yang Zhao glanced at Xiao Mi and said sarcastically, “Weren’t you acting so nice to me just a few days ago?”

“Who knew you were a despicable, shameless, and detestable person!” Xiao Mi cursed.

Yang Zhao’s expression immediately darkened.

He narrowed his eyes and sized up Xiao Mi. Suddenly, his heart throbbed.

Although Xiao Mi wasn’t as beautiful as Xiao Yu, she was definitely good-looking!

Besides, Xiao Mi’s background wasn’t as complicated as Xiao Yu’s. If he wanted to play around... she would be a good choice!

“Why didn’t I notice Xiao Mi before...” Yang Zhao couldn’t help but size up Xiao Mi with a lecherous look.

Xiao Mi stared at him and said, “What are you still standing there for? Hurry up and take Xiao Yu to the hospital!”

Yang Zhao thought for a moment and said with a wicked smile, “Xiao Mi, why don’t you come with me to take Xiao Yu to the hospital? Are you at ease with me going alone?”

Hearing this, Xiao Mi couldn’t help but frown

After thinking for a moment, she nodded and said, “I’ll go with you. If anything happens to Xiao Yu, I’ll definitely not let you off!”

“Okay, no problem!” Yang Zhao couldn’t help but smirk to himself.

When they reached the destination, he would have his way with her!

Then, Yang Zhao carried Xiao Yu and walked into the car.

Looking at Xiao Yu’s fair and smooth legs, Yang Zhao felt more and more aroused. He almost drooled.

But when he thought of last night’s scene, Yang Zhao couldn’t help but shiver. In the end, he didn’t dare to make a move.

Yang Zhao drove away from the race track and headed towards a remote mountain.

At this moment, there was an old man waiting on the mountain.
