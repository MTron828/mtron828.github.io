Chapter 739: I, Qin Yu, Have Nothing to Fear! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The direction of Chou Heguang’s deduction seemed to be different from that of Qin Yu and the man with the mustache.

The direction he was pointing at was in the east, while Qin Yu and the man with the mustache thought it was in the southeast.

“Why would there be a difference?” Qin Yu was a little puzzled.

The man with the mustache explained, “There are too many uncertainties in the Great Dao. Each time, there might be a different result.”

“Normally, a master would deduce many times to determine the location.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Then, our result might not be true?”

“No.” The man with the mustache shook his head.

“I’m referring to the birth of ordinary treasures. The signs of the birth of ten-thousand-year-old herbs are still very obvious, so there won’t be any problems with our conjectures.”

Qin Yu touched his chin and said, “Then there must be a problem with Chou Heguang.”

The man with the mustache snorted. “Chou Heguang’s talent is average, and he is also a vain person.”

“He relies on his little ability to seek social status, so his ability is naturally getting worse and worse.”

Qin Yu nodded.

Just as the man with the mustache said, a person with ability didn’t need to forcefully seek social status.

The so-called wealth and status were just additional products brought by outstanding ability.

“Master Chou, this time it’s all up to you,” Granny Qin said with a smile.

Chou Heguang waved his hand and said with a nonchalant smile, “It’s just a small matter. It’s not worth mentioning.”

The people around were still boasting about Chou Heguang, saying what kind of big shot he was and what kind of heavenly secrets he was.

Countless praises made Chou Heguang feel a little smug.

“Hehe, anyone can become a master.” The man with the mustache couldn’t help but mutter softly.

Even though the man with the mustache’s voice wasn’t loud, he could still hear it clearly.

“Kid, what did you say?” Granny Qin narrowed her eyes and said.

The man with the mustache was so scared that he trembled. He quickly smiled and said, “Nothing, nothing. I was just talking nonsense.”

Granny Qin had wanted to teach the man with the mustache a lesson. Now that she had found an opportunity, she wouldn’t let it go.

Granny Qin led the crowd and walked toward the man with the mustache.

“Are you mocking Master Chou?” Granny Qin said coldly.

“I knew you weren’t a good person. How dare you spout nonsense today?”

The man with the mustache said awkwardly, “I. . . I didn’t mean that. You heard wrong...”

Granny Qin snorted coldly. “I heard wrong? Are you saying that my ears aren’t good?”

“Yes, he’s saying that your ears aren’t good.” Qin Yu couldn’t stand watching from the side.

He stood in front of the man with the mustache and said coldly, “Old b*stard, so what if he says that your ears aren’t good?”

Granny Qin’s expression changed, and the internal qi on her body was also increasing.

Her eyes rolled, but she wasn’t in a hurry to attack.

Granny Qin was very calculative. She knew that if she attacked Qin Yu now, it would exhaust her strength.

After the 10,000-year-old herbs were born, she would lose her ability to compete.

Hence, Granny Qin sneered. “You can mock me, but what do you mean by mocking Master Chou?”

“Right! What do you mean by mocking Master Chou? Are you doubting Master Chou’s ability?” Someone beside her shouted.

Chou Heguang also said with a smirk, “What did you say about me back then? I didn’t hear it clearly.”

Qin Yu glanced at Master Chou and sneered. “Looks like your ears aren’t that good either. Alright, then I’ll repeat it for him.”

“You, Master Chou, have a few tricks up your sleeve. The success rate of the deduction is only 20%. You’re just a dog with a broken spine who’s greedy for vanity. Scolding you is just giving you face!”

“Do you understand now!?”

These few words made Master Chou’s expression extremely cold.

He glared at Qin Yu and said sinisterly, “You dare to look down on me? Do you know what divination is?”

“Half an hour ago, I didn’t know, but now, I understand.” Qin Yu said with a nonchalant smile.

“And my ability is probably above yours.”

Master Chou couldn’t help but laugh out loud. “Hahaha! Your ability is above mine? Do you know any Great Dao?!”

“Let me tell you, there are very few people in this world who can deduce the heavenly secrets! Just you? You dare to speak so arrogantly?”

Qin Yu sneered. “You are just trash. You are just an ordinary person with mediocre talent. You can’t deduce it eight times out of ten times, yet you still dare to come out and bluff.”

“I will also tell you. We have also deduced the location.”

Chou Heguang sneered. “Did you hear the location I said? Are you pretending that you deduced it yourself now?”

“Don’t be so narcissistic. The direction we deduced is different from yours.” Qin Yu sneered.

“Only a retard would go to the east.”

After a few words, Chou Heguang couldn’t hold it in anymore.

He glared at Qin Yu and shouted, “It’s fine if you humiliate me, but you dare to humiliate my ability! You are humiliating the Great Dao! This is disrespectful!”

“Disrespectful? F * ck, don’t swindle people here.” Qin Yu sneered.

“Great Dao? What do you know about the Great Dao?”

Chou Heguang’s expression became even darker.

He took a deep breath and said, “He was disrespectful to me and to the Heavenly Dao! If I don’t kill him, I will definitely anger the Heavenly Dao this time and invite disaster!”

He was clearly fanning the flames.

“I think Master Chou is right,” Granny Qin agreed.

As a result, more than twenty Martial Marquises walked forward one after another.

They surrounded Qin Yu and the others in the middle, emitting waves of strong killing intent.

Qin Yu looked at the people around him coldly and said, “What a bunch of brainless idiots. This idiot is obviously using you guys. Can’t you see?”

“This has nothing to do with you,” someone beside him coldly said.

Granny Qin put her hands behind her back and said indifferently, “This guy also has a deep emnity with our association.”

As soon as these words were said, everyone became even more eager.

“Please don’t kill him. Spare his life. Just cripple him,” Granny Qin said with a smile.

Qin Yu looked coldly at Granny Qin and said, “Old b*stard, remember this. When the time comes, I will cripple that b*stard you raised!”

Granny Qin’s expression immediately darkened at the mention of Blackie.

“Everyone, make your move. The Jingdu Martial Arts Association will remember this favor,” Granny Qin said coldly.

Killing intent filled the surroundings. The internal qi of more than twenty Martial Marquises was incomparably dense.

Even Qin Yu felt waves of pressure.

“Protect Little Yu.” Qin Yu glanced at the man with the mustache.

Then, Qin Yu took large strides forward, and golden light suddenly appeared on his body!

That domineering internal qi caused everyone’s hearts to tremble!

“Come! I, Qin Yu, have nothing to fear!” Qin Yu shouted loudly. His internal qi and blood churned, and his internal qi reached its peak!Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m
