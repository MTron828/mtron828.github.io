Chapter 1231: Chapter 1,231, background 

Deer Emperor held the chain in his hand and actually wanted to turn Qin Yu into a substitute for the Purple Jade origin snake!

These words were extremely overbearing and made people’s hearts tremble!

Qin Yu sneered, “That will depend on whether you have the ability or not.”

“Looks like you want to experience it.”Deer Emperor narrowed his eyes. At this moment, with a flip of his palm, the chain actually disappeared!

In the next second, before Qin Yu could react, the chain suddenly appeared on Qin Yu’s body!

“HMM?”Qin Yu frowned slightly.

He did not see how the chain came to his body.

“What kind of method is this?”Qin Yu whispered.

Not far away, deer emperor could not help but sneer, “This object is called the coiling dragon lock. Once you are bound, all your strength will disappear. Without my command, you will only become a cripple.”

“Now, you can only serve me and replace the Purple Jade origin snake!”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and sneered, “Do you really think I am that Beast?”

Lu Huang opened his mouth and just as he was about to speak, he saw Qin Yu’s body suddenly shake, and the coiling dragon lock that was tied to his body was instantly shattered!

“That’s it?”Qin Yu sneered. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Lu Huang’s expression was somewhat ugly. He looked coldly at Qin Yu and said, “Who exactly are you?”

“I am who I am,”Qin Yu said coldly.

At this moment, the Deer Emperor had already seen that Qin Yu was extraordinary, and he began to feel apprehensive in his heart.

Although he had a powerful spell, he did not want to make enemies everywhere to avoid attracting unnecessary trouble.

At this moment, a man dressed in tight clothes hurriedly ran over.

He lay beside the deer emperor and said in a low voice, “Lord Deer Emperor, we have found out.”

“Speak,”Lu Huang said in a low voice.

That kid hurriedly said, “This person’s name is Qin Yu. He is the sect master of the Heaven Gate and has an outstanding record.”

After saying that, he told Lu Huang about Qin Yu’s background.

After listening to it, Lu Huang could not help but be shocked.

He glanced at Qin Yu and said in a low voice, “No wonder he has such ability.”

“That’s right. This person was also known as the number one person in the world,”the kid next to him continued.

“Previously, it was rumored that he went to the holy region, but for some reason, he suddenly appeared on Deer Emperor Island.”

Deer Emperor remained silent, his eyes flickering.

Offending such a powerful opponent was not what he wanted to see.

After weighing the pros and cons, Deer Emperor once again walked in front of Qin Yu.

He smiled faintly and said, “So it’s little friend Qin. Sorry for not respecting you.”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and sneered, “What do you mean by this?”

Lu Huang laughed out loud and said, “It was just a little misunderstanding just now. I hope little friend Qin doesn’t take it to heart.”

“Oh? I killed your purple jade origin snake. Don’t you plan to take revenge?”Qin Yu’s tone was somewhat mocking.

Deer Emperor waved his hand and said, “It’s just a beast. After the death of a purple jade origin snake, it’s worth it to get a friend like you!”

Hearing Deer Emperor’s words, everyone was shocked!

Not only did deer emperor not care, but he wanted to become friends with this kid?

“What’s the background of this kid?”

“I don’t know, but looking at his strength, his background shouldn’t be weak.”

“To the deer emperor, what he likes the most is to befriend the strong and trample on the weak.”

Qin Yu looked coldly at the deer emperor in front of him and couldn’t help but snicker, “Friend? When did I become friends with you?”

These words were undoubtedly a fierce slap on the Deer Emperor’s face!

As expected, the Deer Emperor’s expression became a little ugly.

He suppressed the anger in his heart and continued to laugh, “Little Friend Qin, it’s just a little misunderstanding between you and me. Now that the misunderstanding has been resolved, why do we need to continue to bicker?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Different paths lead to different strategies. I don’t like your style of doing things. It’s already good enough that we don’t make enemies. As for becoming friends, I think we should just forget about it.”

“Kid, don’t be so Shameless!”The person next to him shouted.

Before Qin Yu could speak, Lu Huang turned around and gave him a slap. He berated, “There’s no place for you to speak here! Quickly apologize to little friend Qin!”

Although the people around Lu Huang were unwilling, they still bowed to Qin Yu and apologized.

In Lu Huang’s eyes, all of this was already giving Qin Yu enough face.

But little did he know that the more he acted like this, the more Qin Yu looked down on him.

Even his own friend was treated like this, let alone other people?

“Lu Huang, I’ve already said that we can’t be friends,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“If you don’t come to find trouble with me, I Won’t touch your brow. If you feel that you can’t swallow this, I’ll accompany you anytime,”Qin Yu said coldly.

After saying this, Qin Yu put away the purple jade origin snake’s fangs and turned around to leave.

Emperor Lu narrowed his eyes and stared at Qin Yu.

Although he was extremely unhappy, he didn’t stop Qin Yu from leaving.

“Lord Lu Huang, are you going to let him go just like that?”Someone beside him whispered.

“That’s right. In front of so many people, he did not show you any mercy at all. Are you going to let him go just like that?”

Lu Huang did not say a word. No one knew what he was thinking.

A moment later, Lu Huang said in a deep voice, “This kid is not simple. His future is limitless. No matter what, we have to take him under our wing!”

“Ah?”The people around could not help but be stunned.

This Qin Yu had slapped Lu Huang’s face in public. Not only did Lu Huang not care, but he was determined to make friends with him?

“Lord Lu Huang, this kid obviously doesn’t want to make friends with you.”The people around frowned.

Lu huang sneered, “If you can’t use force, then use force. I don’t believe that he is made of stone!”

...

Under everyone’s watchful eyes, Qin Yu turned around and walked out of the huge manor.

The surrounding people couldn’t help but swallow their saliva, as if they couldn’t believe that this scene was real.

As soon as he walked out of the manor, Di Zun ran up excitedly.

“Master, you are too awesome!”Di Zun gave Qin Yu a thumbs up.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Killing a purple jade origin snake is considered awesome?”

“No, no, no. Killing a purple jade origin snake is nothing.”Di Zun shook his head.

“It’s nothing even if you don’t give face to the deer emperor in public.”

This made Qin Yu somewhat surprised.

He stopped and said, “Then what are you referring to?”
