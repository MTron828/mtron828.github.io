Chapter 1069: Chapter 1,069, the power of the Sky Blood Rainbow 

Before everyone could be shocked, Qin Yu had already rejected the higher-ups!

The surrounding crowd seemed to feel a sense of regret.

If they could take a mighty figure as their master, then they could walk unhindered in this world! They could even become the new leader of the Martial Arts Association of Jingdu, as well as the Master of the Second Secret Realm!

But under such a generous temptation, Qin Yu actually rejected him!

“Since that’s the case, then I definitely can not keep you. Otherwise, you will definitely become a disaster.”The tone of the higher-up was extremely cold.

He held the divine cauldron in his hand and shouted, “What a pity for a talent like you. Go and Die!”

With that said, the divine cauldron in his hand swung towards Qin Yu!

In an instant, golden patterns appeared beneath the Divine Cauldron! These patterns seemed to be the true Great Dao!

The Divine Cauldron was actually stepping on the Great Dao. How was Qin Yu going to deal with it? !

The Immortal Crane’s expression changed. It activated the demonic beast phenomenon, intending to compensate Qin Yu and resist the divine cauldron together!

But at this moment, Qin Yu let out a shout and a painting appeared in his hand!

The painting was extremely ancient, as if it was made of goatskin. It looked extremely ordinary, without the slightest internal Qi flowing!

However, such a picture in Qin Yu’s hands displayed an unparalleled might!

The picture was thrown forward to meet the divine cauldron of the higher-ups!

At the moment of collision, it was not as earth-shattering as imagined! Instead, it was extremely peaceful!

The divine cauldron that the higher-ups had evolved into instantly collapsed!

The golden patterns under its body also cracked densely!

“Crash!”

The Divine Cauldron was like a piece of weathered gravel, turning into fine powder. With a slight breeze, it disappeared without a trace!

Seeing this, Qin Yu was instantly overjoyed!

“This picture is indeed useful!”Qin Yu shouted excitedly!

The higher-ups not far away, however, furrowed their brows tightly.

He looked at the picture in Qin Yu’s hand and said coldly, “What kind of divine artifact are you holding in Your Hand?”

Qin Yu sneered, “I won’t tell you.”

The higher-up’s face was extremely ugly. He didn’t activate the next spell, but stared at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu seemed to have guessed something.

He put away the picture and sneered, “What? You Don’t have time, right?”

The higher-up narrowed his eyes and didn’t answer.

“It seems that I guessed correctly.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh.

“You can only send out this strand of divine sense. A mere strand of divine sense is able to display 50% of its power. This means that your divine sense will definitely not be able to last for long!”

“You think that with the technique in your hands, you can definitely kill me, right? Unfortunately, I have disappointed you.”

The higher-ups did not say anything. In the next second, he suddenly shot towards the direction of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!

Everyone was stunned. They did not seem to have guessed the significance of the higher-ups’actions.

“Not good! He wants to destroy the second secret realm!”Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

“Hurry up and stop him!”

Qin Yu did not dare to delay. He hurriedly stepped on the ‘xing’character and quickly chased after him!

However, that higher-ups were in the Almighty Realm. Even if Qin Yu used the ‘Xing’character, he still would not be able to catch up!

“Stop right there!”Qin Yu roared repeatedly. He held the golden light in his hand and smashed it towards the back of the higher-ups!

“Boom!”

The higher-ups seemed to have given up on resisting. He only wanted to return to the second mystic realm as soon as possible and destroy the second mystic realm!

Qin Yu’s fist was like a golden rain as it continuously smashed towards his body.

His body was continuously being smashed until it collapsed. Blood kept spewing out of his mouth, but he still did not stop his body!

“Swoosh!”

Finally, the higher-ups rushed into the second secret realm!

Qin Yu naturally did not dare to be negligent, and followed closely behind. He held the golden light in his hand, and with a punch, he broke ten thousand arts, intending to kill Gu Zizhen!

The higher-ups did not seem to be able to hold on for long. As he fled, he used secret arts, preparing to destroy the second secret realm!

“Go to hell!”

Qin Yu roared, and the Golden Fist in his hand turned into a long dragon. With a roar, it smashed toward Gu Zizhen’s back!

“No!”

Zhai Xing’s face was filled with horror! He did not care about his injuries and tried his best to protect Gu Zizhen!

However, he was injured, so how could he stop him!

Boom

This punch completely shattered Gu Zizhen’s body!

The spell in his hand also disappeared.

Seeing this, Qin Yu immediately let out a sigh of relief. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“That was close...”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Meanwhile, Zhai Xing, who was on the ground, had a sorrowful expression on his face, and his eyes were filled with a trace of pain.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “He’s not Gu Zizhen. Gu Zizhen is already dead.”

As he spoke, that strand of divine sense from the higher-ups emerged from Gu Zizhen’s body.

This phantom looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Qin Yu, you’ve ruined my plans many times. I Won’t let you off.”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Don’t say such useless nonsense. I’m afraid that this strand of divine sense of yours won’t be able to do anything.”

The higher-up laughed and said, “That’s good, that’s good. Don’t worry. I’ll open the passage between the first and second secret realms as soon as possible. When that time comes, I’ll definitely descend with my true body.”

“Alright, I’ll wait for You,”Qin Yu said coldly.

After saying that, Qin Yu waved his hand and directly wiped out this trace of divine sense.

Gu Zizhen’s body fell to the ground.

Without the support of his primordial spirit, the wounds on his body quickly festered and turned into a pile of meat paste in the blink of an eye.

Zhai Xing looked at Gu Zizhen who was lying on the ground, his face full of pain.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “Bury him.”

Zhai Xing raised his head and looked at Qin Yu. He didn’t say anything. He just picked up Gu Zizhen’s piece of rotten meat.

Then, Qin Yu looked at the eight light pillars erected in the second secret realm.

“This thing hasn’t disappeared,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

The immortal crane grunted and said, “Without the main body, where did the power absorbed by this secret art go?”

After the immortal Crane’s reminder, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

“That’s right! The main body of the Sky Blood Rainbow isn’t in the second secret realm. According to this power, it must be relying on some carrier of the Second Secret Realm!”Qin Yu said in alarm.

“Hurry up and look for it. Maybe we can get this power before the Sky Blood Rainbow!”
