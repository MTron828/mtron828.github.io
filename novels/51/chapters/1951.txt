1952 I Don’t Give a Damn!

Qin Yu opened his eyes. He could feel he was about to break through, so he stood up immediately.

He came to the side of a cultivator and said anxiously, “How long has it been since I came to Xihuang Island?”

However, the cultivator looked at Qin Yu suspiciously and muttered, “Who are you, and why have I never seen you before?”

As soon as he said that, Qin Yu’s heart thumped.

D*mn! Something had happened!

He touched his face, and as expected, his face had changed back!

“No, I have to leave this place as soon as possible,” Qin Yu thought.

He didn’t have time to think and quickly ran toward the border of Xihuang Island.

However, when he arrived at the entrance of Xihuang Island, he found out the surrounding had been sealed off.

Rays of light hovered in the surroundings encircling the entire Xihunag Island.

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically, and he clenched his fist and punched toward the light!

“Boom!”

As his fist smashed down, the barrier of the entire Xihuang Island instantly trembled slightly, but there was no sign of breaking!

After all, it was the joint effort of several Semi-Saints who had set up this secret technique. It was not something Qin Yu could break!

“D*mn…” Qin Yu’s expression was extremely unsightly, for he had never expected the time to pass so quickly!

Qin Yu’s punch failed to break the barrier, but it alerted the third princess.

Leading the crowd, the third princess rushed toward Xihuang Island.

Sensing the third princess’s internal qi, Qin Yu panicked. He had no way out and could only brace himself and turn his back to the third princess.

Soon the third princess and several Semi-Saints came to Qin Yu’s back.

“Brother, where are you going?” the third Princess asked.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said, “I’m leaving Xihuang Island. I have things to do. I’ll come back to look for you when I’m done.”

However, with a frivolous look, the third princess said with a smile, “Brother, don’t leave and stay in my palace.”

“No, I’ve said that I have to leave. Tell them to remove the technique!” Qin Yu said anxiously.

The third princess kept shaking her head and said, “I won’t let you go. You can’t leave today and in the future. You have to accompany me here forever.”

“‘I’ve already said no!” Qin Yu was so anxious that he was sweating profusely. If she found out, it would be troublesome!

“Isn’t it good to stay here? There are food and drink, and you’ll be taken care of. I can even send you divine pills to help your cultivation.” The third princess was walking closer and closer.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said, “I’ve said no! I must leave!”

The third princess sighed and said, “You men are indeed unreliable. In that case, I can only force you to stay.”

Then the third princess walked toward Qin Yu.

Without thinking further, Qin Yu quickly covered his face.

His action instantly angered the third princess. She said with great displeasure, “Why are you not looking at me?”

“I… My face is not well.” Qin Yu casually made up an excuse.

“Brother, you should take your hand off.” Although the third princess sounded calm, there was a hint of threat.

The Semi-Saints also quickly walked over, ready to attack at any time.

Qin Yu was tremendously anxious. He was already at a dead end and had nowhere to hide.

“Forget it. I think I’m not that bad looking. Perhaps I can charm the third princess,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Then Qin Yu bit the bullet and took his hand off, revealing his true look. He even made an expression that he thought he was quite handsome.

Seeing Qin Yu’s face, the third princess was stunned at first, and then a trace of anger appeared on her face.

“Who are you, and why are you here?” The third princess said coldly.

“Third Princess, I’m your Brother,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

“F*cking Brother! You’re f*cking courting death!” The third princess was furious, and a terrifying internal qi burst out of her body!

At the same time, the Semi-Saints quickly moved forward and pressed Qin Yu down!

“With such a look, you called yourself Brother? You f*cking Brother!” The third princess cursed and kept slapping Qin Yu’s face.

Under the restraint of several Semi-Saints, Qin Yu could not resist at all. He could only let the third princess slap her face.

Although the third princess was not strong, she was not weak either. Soon after several slaps, blood flowed out of the corner of Qin Yu’s mouth.

“D*mn it! I’m not ugly!” Qin Yu cursed in his heart!

Although he wasn’t handsome, he was at least pleasant to look at! How did he make the third princess so angry?

“Tell me! Who are you, and why did you come to Xihuang Island?” the third princess said coldly after venting her anger.

Qin Yu opened his mouth but not knowing how to answer.

“Third Princess, it’s better to report this matter to the Holy Lord,” a Semi-Saint by the third princess’s side said.

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically, and he quickly said, “Misunderstanding, it’s all a misunderstanding. I’ll go now!”

The third princess said coldly, “That’s too easy for him then! I’m going to keep him on Xihunag Island and make him a slave!”

“Third Princess, this man has changed his look and sneaked into Xihuang Island. I’m afraid he has some evil intentions. If he is a spy sent by some aristocratic families, it will be troublesome. It’s better to hand him over to Holy Lord,” the Semi-Saint continued saying.

Qin Yu’s face was extremely ugly. He thought hard but couldn’t find a way to break out of this situation. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

...

“Okay,” the third princess said after remaining silent for a while. “But with a condition. After your investigation, bring him back to me immediately!”

“Third Princess, don’t worry,” the Semi-Saint quickly said.

“Leave him to me.”

At this moment, a voice was heard.

The person was none other than Uncle Yan.

With a smile on his face, Uncle Yan walked up to Qin Yu step by step.

“You again!” The third princess looked extremely displeased.

Uncle Yan bowed slightly and said, “Third Princess. I know this man. I was the one who sent him to Xihuang Island. He is not a villain, but an old friend of mine.”

“I don’t care about that,” the third princess snorted cold and said. “He changed his look to deceive me. I will never let him off!”

Uncle Yan’s brows slightly furrowed, but he immediately smiled and said, “Third Princess, please let him go for the sake of me.”

“For the sake of you? My a*s! I said no means no! He must stay, I won’t give a damn about anyone!” the third princess shouted.

...

With that, the Semi-Saints by her side stepped forward and blocked Uncle Yan.

Uncle Yan’s brows furrowed even more. He knew the third princess’s temper well. If she didn’t let him go, no one could do anything.

“Third Princess, how about this? I’ll find you another handsome man and send him to Xihuang island. What do you think?” Uncle Yan asked tentatively.
