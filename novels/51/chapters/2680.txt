Therefore, he was certain that this state would not last for long.

Qin Yu sighed softly. At this moment, he felt an indescribable power. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The Miracle Qi had already surged through his entire body. The sword light was as slow as a snail in front of his eyes.

The Tiger Wing directly stood on the Prajna and hacked it to the ground.

As the sword missed, the 64 swords of the eight trigrams appeared around Qin

Yu again.

Qin Yu’s Tiger Wing stabbed to the ground fiercely. A violent saber intent erupted from the Tiger Wing, instantly smashing the 64 swords into powder.

“Hua Tian, no matter what you plan, you will die in my hands today. You are destined to have no future.”

Qin Yu retracted his Tiger Wing and smiled miserably.

He did not even look at Hua Tian opposite him.

“Qin Yu, after absorbing such a large amount of Miracle Qi, it is likely that you will not have a future…”

Immortal Emperor Yao’s voice rang out in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

Hua Tian’s face naled- The 6/1 swords had been destroved. and he had suffered

a huge backlash.

“Alright, the power of the black lotus has also been injected into my body. Since the Sky-splitting Slash with the power of two divinations can’t succeed, then I’ll use my sword with the power of three divinations.”

His expression twisted as he let out a furious roar.

Qian, Kun, Dui, Li, Zhen, xun, Kan, Gen

The eight trigrams appeared between heaven and earth again. The power of the Qian, Kun, and Dui trigrams erupted.

Three huge bolts of lightning once again entered the Divination Sword. The form of the sword changed again.

Three different internal qi intertwined together, forming the Heaven and Earth sword, and pierced Qin Yu’s body.

This sword emitted a shocking sword chant and directly pierced through Qin

The terrifying Spiritual Energy Sword and the Black Lotus Fire completely turned the place where Qin Yu was into nothingness.

The Seal of Heaven Returning on Qin Yu’s body lit up. At this moment, the sequence of life and death in this Saint Kingdom was displayed in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

He saw the power of life and death that ran through the entire Saint Kingdom. He saw the mark of the Seal of Heaven Returning. That was the extreme understanding of the power of life and death, the Order of Heaven Reversal.

In an instant, he reappeared in front of Hua Tian.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s body was emitting a terrifying power that terrified Hua Tian. Under the effect of the Miracle Qi, his divine soul had already surpassed Dao Consciousness and Holy Consciousness. Not only that, but he was also rising toward the power of the Saint Kingdom’s ruler. Each of his divine soul powers had undergone some kind of unbelievable change.

This transformation was like burning all the potential in his body, squeezing out all the strength in his body.

In addition, it was impossible to stop until all his strength was drained, making him disappear from this Saint Kingdom.

This was how terrifying the Miracle O. the power derived from the Reborn Lotus was. This was an item from the Divine Realm.

It had forced Qin Yu, who was only in the early-stage Dao Consciousness realm, to have such terrifying strength and even forcefully reversed his cosmic luck.

At this moment, Hua Tian could feel Qin Yu’s terrifying internal qi fluctuation.

He looked terrified. For the first time, he felt regret.

“It’s too late to leave now.”

Qin Yu smiled as he looked at Hua Tian. At this moment, he could not only sense the power of this Saint Kingdom.

He could even sense some of the power in the vast world of the Saint Kingdom.

“Is this the power that Senior Wu Ji comprehended? It’s so insignificant, but it’s so powerful.’

The Breath of Yellow Springs in the ghost realm and the power of destruction in the Saint Kingdom.

At this moment, the two streams of energy pierced through the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom and landed on Qin Yu.

God-slaying Dusk of the Gods!

This was the first time Qin Yu was able to use this sword move after coming to the Saint Kingdom.

In the lower realm, Qin Yu’s divine soul had only comprehended the power below the fifth level. At this moment, he could already draw on the power of the Saint’s world.

Qin Yu used a saber in place of a sword, combining the two powers.

As he swung his blade, the sky of eternal night emitted the bleak light of dusk.

In an instant, the endless abyss formed by Wu Tian’s twelfth-grade Black Lotus of Annihilation seemed to sense danger.

It turned into a stream of light and disappeared in front of Hua Tian, leaving behind a pale Hua Tian.

“Qin Yu, let’s talk things out. Let me go and I’ll tell you all my secrets!”

Hua Tian shouted in fear.

“Die. ”

With a slash, Hua Tian’s body was cut in half. The terrifying power of the God-slaying Dusk turned his body into a cloud of blood mist.

The light of dusk slowly came to an end. The Demon Sealing Valley once again returned to eternal night.

“What a terrifying power! To be able to sense the power of rules outside the

Saint Kingdom, this kind of divine soul strength has even surpassed that of a

Holy Consciousness. How is this possible?”

Gu Ying’s face was filled with disbelief. The power of the God-slaying Dusk didn’t belong to the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom at all.

To be able to land in this Saint Kingdom meant that Qin Yu’s current divine sense power had already surpassed that of a Holy Consciousness.

“The refinement in his hand should be a Buddhist supreme treasure, Reborn Lotus. The Miracle Qi within it will allow one’s potential to rise to the limit. That is used by the Buddhist mighty realm cultivators of the Divine Realm to comprehend the true Great Dao. It is truly out of the five elements. That is the true power of miracle.”

Dan sighed.

“What? Does the glazed jade lotus have such power? Why didn’t you mention it before, valley master?”

Gu Ying’s expression changed drastically. He did not expect that the inconspicuous glazed jade lotus that Qin Yu took away had such a shocking origin.

“This thing needs to mobilize the true power of a Saint Kingdom to produce the Miracle Qi. When Holy Lord Dao Xuan was around, this thing was already sealed in the Treasure Repository Pavilion. Even I forgot about it, but I didn’t expect this kid to obtain it. However, the Great Dao was heartless, and everything had a price. How can one survive in the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom after obtaining such power? The price of using this thing is death. Otherwise, how could such a divine artifact fall here?”

Looking at Qin Yu’s rising power, Dan sighed again.

The power of miracle was built on the original foundation. In other words, the original foundation could reach a certain level before it could be raised to the extreme of that height.

If an ordinary person were to obtain this power of miracle, one would not be able to reach the realm of experts in an instant even one consuming it.

Qin Yu’s future potential was to be a martial artist. He could not reach the strength of the path entry-level at all, let alone reach the saint level.

At this moment, the more Qin Yu’s strength rose, the more Dan felt it was a pity.

Wu Tian looked at the black lotus that had returned on its own and fell into deep thought.

Seeing Wu Tian’s grim expression, the surrounding ancient demons lowered their voices.

“So it’s the Reborn Lotus. With such a heaven-defying item, can you still escape the calamity?”

Wu Tian moved his hand slightly. A lot of information from the black lotus entered his body. He immediately understood what had just happened..
