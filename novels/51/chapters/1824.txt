1825 The Tong Family Taking Action

Qin Yu’s face was as calm as the sea. He looked at Jue Wu and said, “Are those two very strong?”

“Yes,” Jue Wu said. “But I’m more worried about more people hiding in the dark.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. What she said indeed made sense.

For an aristocratic family in Zhongzhou like the Tong family, it was not difficult to find someone at the Reversion Void Stage.

“We’ll be safe as long as we get back to Thunder Courtyard, Qin Yu said.

!!

When Jue Wu opened her mouth and was about to speak, her expression turned cold.

“I’m afraid it’s already too late,” Jue Wu said coldly.

In the next second, Jue Wu’s small hand shook, and she took out the Glided Rake!

The Glided Rake in Jue Wu’s hand emitted a golden radiance. The killing intent on her body also exploded to the extreme.

Although Jue Wu was only in the Early-stage of the Reversion Void, she was originally powerful. In addition, she had absorbed the purple cloud pearl. Thus her current strength was immeasurable.

Qin Yu knew that his opponent had caught up with him, so he didn’t say anything else. He immediately burst out all his qi energy, getting ready to fight.

“You step aside,” Jue Wu coldly said.

“You take the opportunity to leave now quickly. You won’t be of any help here.”

Qin Yu opened his mouth, feeling extremely uncomfortable.

He disliked the feeling of being protected by others, worse still, the feeling of being powerless when he couldn’t help with anything.

However, the truth was that Qin Yu was no match for a Reversion Void Stage cultivator.

“Buzz!”

The void was torn open, and two men walked out.

These two people were sent by the Tong family.

They looked down from above at Jue Wu and Qin Yu and coldly said, “You’re pretty fast.”

Qin Yu clenched her fist slightly and said coldly, ” “How Xiao sheng now?”

“Oh? You still care about others when you’re about to die?” one of them sneered and said.

“Qin Yu, you’ve snatched something from my Tong family. Hand it over now. Otherwise, you’ll die,” the other man chided.

“Cut the f*cking crap!” Jue Wu shouted. The Glided Rake in her hand shook and directly blocked Qin Yu’s way.

“If you want to fight, I’ll accompany you!” Jue Wu’s hair danced wildly. She was like a demoness.

The two people by the side glanced at her, sneered, and said, “If I’m not wrong, you should be Jue Wu, one of the three lunatics of Nanzhou. Unfortunately, you’re no match for the two of us,”

“F*ck your mother!” Jue Wu cursed.

At this moment, Qin Yu stopped Jue Wu.

He raised his head to look at the two people standing in mid-air and said, “You want that token for a Forbidden Zone, right?”

“Forbidden Zone?” The two looked confused.

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

It seemed that these two people did not know the secret of the Tong family.

However, it made sense. This matter was of great importance. Once it spread, the Tong family would not have the strength to keep the token.

Therefore, the Tong family would not simply tell others about this matter. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“So, both of you are servants,” Qin Yu said sarcastically.

“Go back and tell your Young Master Tong that if he dares to come and look for trouble again, I’ll tell this to the nine great aristocratic families of Zhongzhou. His wishful thinking will then be ruined!” Qin Yu shouted.

The two men frowned and said impatiently, “I don’t know what you’re talking about. If you have anything to say, just come back with us to the Tong family and tell the young master yourself.”

“That will depend on whether you have the ability to do so,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Having said that, Qin Yu knew that he was absolutely unable to resist these two people with his ability.

He could only rely on Jue Wu. With Jue Wu’s strength and the Glided Rake, he would definitely have the power to fight.

Jue Wu shook the Glided Rake in her hand and then pointed it at the two of them.

She then looked at Qin Yu and said softly, “Go back to Thunder Courtyard.”

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. ” Hang on. I’m going back to Thunder Courtyard to get help now.”

There were many experts in Thunder Courtyard, and there might even be True Saint. As long as Thunder Courtyard took action, these two people were not worth mentioning.

After saying this, Qin Yu stepped the line word formula and was about to retreat.

“You want to leave? In your dreams!” Seeing this, one of them immediately shouted and charged at Qin Yu!

“Go to hell!”

At this moment, Jue Wu waved the Glided Rake and ruthlessly smashed it toward him!

A terrifying internal qi exploded in that instant, and the space was directly split into two!

Before the arrival of the Glided Rake, its terrifying internal qi had already crushed everything!

“D*mn it!” The face of the Tong family member who was chasing after Qin Yu suddenly changed, and he hurriedly dodged to the side.

Even though he was extremely fast, he was still slightly swept by the remaining power of the Gilded Rake.

It was just a wisp of internal qi that had slightly swept him, but it directly sent him flying. Instantly, he was covered in blood and could not stop vomiting blood!

Seeing this, Qin Yu was slightly relieved.

He didn’t waste any more time and hurriedly used the line word formula to dash away.

The path seemed to have been forcibly cut off by Jue Wu. If they wanted to pursue him, they had to go past Jue Wu.

Jue Wu single-handedly grabbed the Glided Rake that was even larger than her body. Her pair of big watery eyes burst out with unprecedented killing intent.

“You’re just two dogs. I’ll kill you today,” Jue Wu coldly said.

“D*mn it, you’ve ruined the plan of our Tong family. You must die!” The two of them were furious. They immediately attacked at the same time, preparing to suppress Jue Wu.

Jue Wu’s palm shook slightly, and a purple light emitted from her palm.

The radiance and the Glided Rake shone together, and a terrifying internal qi instantly hovered in the surroundings!

Jue Wu brandished the Glided Rake with both hands as if she was going to shatter this world!

On the other end, Qin Yu did not dare to waste any time. He sped toward Thunder Courtyard

Along the way, Qin Yu’s speed reached the extreme.

Fortunately, Thunder Courtyard wasn’t too far away. It only took him two hours or so to return to Demon-slaying Peak.

As soon as he returned to Demon-slaying Peak, Qin Yu went straight to the cave abode of the peak master.

Unfortunately, there was no one in the peak master’s cave abode.

Qin Yu had no choice but to rush to Jiu Xiao’s cave abode.

As expected, the peak master was playing chess with Jiu Xiao.

The peak master was not too surprised to see Qin Yu walking in.

“What’s the matter? Are you ready?” he asked while playing chess.

Qin Yu’s said with a gloomy expression, “Peak Master, Jue Wu and I have been attacked. She is now in danger and needs your help.”

The peak master frowned. He slowly stood up and said, “Someone is attacking Jue Wu? Who’s it?”

“The Tong family of Zhongzhou,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

He was unsure if the peak master would help.

“How dare they touch the people of Demon-slaying Peak?” the peak master said coldly. “They must have been tired of living!”

The peak master then looked at Jiu Xiao and said, “Jiu Xiao, go and summon all the people of Demon-slaying Peak here!”
