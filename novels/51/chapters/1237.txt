Chapter 1238: Chapter 1,238, lovers meet 

These two people were Yan Ruoxue’s people, so Qin Yu naturally wouldn’t say anything.

The two of them grabbed Qin Yu’s arm and sped off in a certain direction. Soon, they disappeared into the night.

Along the way, the two of them were extremely fast, and Qin Yu was caught in the middle by them. It was quite strange.

The two of them did not know where they were running to. They flew in the air for dozens of minutes, but they still did not seem to stop.

“Where are you going?”Qin Yu asked, somewhat puzzled.

He could clearly feel that the two of them were constantly going in circles, circling around the same place at least five times.

The two of them did not answer Qin Yu’s question.

After another half an hour, the two of them finally stopped.

They brought Qin Yu and stopped in a deep forest.

There were wild beasts roaring and birds chirping. From time to time, a strong wind would blow and rustling sounds could be heard from the leaves.

The two of them glanced around, then raised their palms and slowly moved in the air in front of them.

A moment later, the entrance of a mystic realm appeared in front of the three of them.

“Go in,”the two of them said coldly.

Although Qin Yu was a little puzzled, he didn’t think too much and immediately stepped into the mystic realm.

The two of them also flashed past and followed closely behind Qin Yu.

This mystic realm was very small, only a few hundred square meters in size. The surroundings were empty, as if it had just been built.

“The Princess is waiting for you in front,”the two said.

Qin Yu was overjoyed. He did not have time to think and hurriedly ran forward.

He saw a beautiful figure in the depths of the mystic realm, with her back facing Qin Yu.

She had a head of beautiful black hair and a body of white long clothes, but they still could not hide her curvaceous figure.

Even with her back facing Qin Yu, he could still feel the faintly discernible immortal qi on her body.

Yan Ruoxue slowly turned her body, and a pair of clear and beautiful eyes came into view.

Looking at this face that he had been longing for day and night, Qin Yu could not be more excited.

An impulse surged up in his heart.

He pulled Yan Ruoxue into his embrace, and all of his longing erupted at this moment.

“I miss you so much...”Qin Yu hugged Yan ruoxue tightly, and his voice was slightly trembling.

Yan Ruoxue’s jade-like hand wrapped around Qin Yu’s back.

“I miss you too.”Yan Ruoxue’s voice came slowly and melodiously.

Yan Ruoxue was very tall, and Qin Yu, who was only 1.7 meters tall, looked almost at the same level as Yan Ruoxue.

He suppressed the excitement in his heart and said, “How have you been recently? I miss you every day, every minute, every second.”

“Looking at the mountain is you, looking at the water is you. Everything I see seems to be your figure.”

Yan Ruoxue covered her mouth and smiled. She gently patted Qin Yu’s head, she said, “If I can, I also want to be with you forever. I don’t want any princess of the Yan family. I just want to wash your clothes and cook for you. Seeing you every day is the life I want.”

Qin Yu was the same, but somehow, he always made it difficult for the two of them to get together.

“I will go to the holy region soon. I already had the chance, but unfortunately, I was delayed by something. Wait for me.”Qin Yu’s voice was somewhat urgent.

Qin Yu seemed to have an endless stream of words, like the water of the Yangtze River.

He seemed to want to tell Yan Ruoxue everything that had happened recently.

Yan Ruoxue did not mind Qin Yu’s nagging at all. She just quietly looked at Qin Yu. Her beautiful eyes never left Qin Yu’s face.

A smile flashed across her face from time to time. This smile was something that others had never seen before. It was a happy smile, the simplest and purest smile.

It was as if the two of them were in a paradise, living the most peaceful and blissful life.

“Princess, we can’t stay for too long. It’s time to leave.”At this moment, the two men in black walked forward and reminded her in a low voice.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little reluctant to leave.

He looked at Yan ruoxue and whispered, “Are you leaving?”

Yan ruoxue smiled and said, “I believe that the next time we meet will not be too long.”

“Definitely Not!”Qin Yu hurriedly said.

“No matter what difficulties we encounter, as long as I think of you, everything seems to be worthless.”Yan Ruoxue suddenly leaned on Qin Yu’s chest and whispered.

“Princess, it’s time to leave.”The two people reminded her again.

This small mystic realm was created by the two black-robed men at the last minute. The purpose was to hide and avoid unnecessary trouble.

To be able to create a mystic realm in such a short period of time was enough to witness the terror of these two black-robed men.

If not for Yan Ruoxue’s stubborn request to see Qin Yu, they would have gone back long ago.

“Alright, I should go.”Yan Ruoxue stood up from Qin Yu’s chest. She gently patted Qin Yu’s forehead and said, “When I’m not here, don’t hook up with other people.”

“Of course!”Qin Yu hurriedly said.

Time was tight. The two black-robed men kept urging them. Even if they were extremely reluctant, it was time to part.

Yan Ruoxue followed behind the two black-robed men and walked towards the exit of the Mystic Realm.

Qin Yu followed behind and said in a low voice, “Ruoxue, I know that you must be under great pressure. I guarantee that I won’t let you wait for too long!”

“I’ll always believe in you.”Yan Ruoxue turned around and smiled. She was truly charming to all living things.

Just as the three of them were about to leave the mystic realm, the void in front of them suddenly trembled.

Seeing this scene, the two black-robed men’s expressions immediately changed!

“Oh no!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

They subconsciously took two steps back and shielded Yan ruoxue behind them.

Meanwhile, Yan Ruoxue subconsciously blocked in front of Qin Yu, as if she still regarded Qin Yu as a young man who did not care about worldly affairs.

The void in front of them was trembling non-stop. In just a moment, a tall man walked out from the void.

His figure was extremely tall, and his entire body was enveloped by chaotic energy. Even the desolate divine eye could not see his face clearly.
