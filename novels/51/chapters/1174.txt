Chapter 1175: Chapter 1,175, the arrival of the Holy Region 

In the room, Fang Yue slowly opened her eyes.

After lying there for nearly three years, Fang Yue’s eyes were now filled with confusion.

She tried to stand up, but found that she couldn’t. If not for the medicinal liquid soaking her, the current Fang Yue would have turned into a skeleton.

“What... What’s going on? Where Is This?”Fang Yue didn’t seem to understand the situation.

She looked around, her eyes becoming more and more confused.

“This is the Divine Alchemist Pavilion,”Qin Yu walked forward and whispered.

“Divine Alchemist Pavilion? is that the place where all the famous pharmacist in the World Gather?”Fang Yue’s eyes were immediately filled with shock.

To her, the Divine Alchemist Pavilion was still at the legendary stage.

“This is the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”Qin Yu looked at the pavilion master at the side.

Hearing this, Fang Yue immediately turned pale with fright. She stood up and wanted to bow.

However, she had been unconscious for too long, so she couldn’t stand up at all.

“This is Yan Yongfu, one of the eight higher-ups of the martial arts association in Jingdu,”Qin Yu said.

The shock on Fang Yue’s face immediately intensified.

She was a smart person, so she quickly realized something.

“I... Have I been lying down for a long time?”Fang Yue asked with a frown.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, it’s been close to three years. These three years... the changes have been too great.”

“You...”Fang Yue sized up Qin Yu from head to toe, as if she wanted to see through Qin Yu’s current realm.

However, she was only at the Grandmaster realm. How could she see through the middle stage of the Martial Saint Realm?

“What exactly happened in these three years?”Fang Yue frowned slightly, as if she was somewhat uneasy.

Qin Yu said, “There’s no rush. I’ll tell you slowly.”

With that, Qin Yu helped Fang Yue up and slowly brought her up in the courtyard to regain the ability to move her limbs.

During this period of time, Qin Yu slowly recounted the events that had happened in the past few years to Fang Yue. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

On the other side, pavilion master and Yan Yongfu retreated to the side.

“The people from the holy region have already arrived. I have a feeling that they won’t be the first batch,”pavilion master said in a deep voice.

Yan Yongfu nodded slightly and said, “Mm, we definitely need them to extradite us to the Holy Region. Otherwise, we won’t be able to activate the ancient array platform.”

Pavilion master looked at Yan Yongfu and said somewhat uneasily, “I don’t know if the people from the holy region are good or evil, and if they are willing to bring us to the Holy Region.”

“In my experience, even if they are willing to extradite, they will only extradite the current Heaven’s favorites. At the very least, there will be a selection,”Yan Yongfu said in a deep voice.

At this point, he looked at Qin Yu, who was downstairs accompanying Fang Yue to recover her physical strength.

“But with Qin Yu’s personality, do you think he will be at the mercy of the people of the Holy Region?”Yan Yongfu looked at Pavilion Master and asked.

The Pavilion Master remained silent, but the answer was already obvious.

“I hope there won’t be any conflicts.”The pavilion master sighed slightly.

Other than them, the others had naturally received the news as well.

Everyone seemed to be waiting for the extradition of this person from the Holy Region.

...

Downstairs, Fang Yue’s limbs had basically returned to normal.

After all, she was a martial artist. Moreover, she was extremely talented, and her recovery ability was much stronger than ordinary people.

“In other words, everyone has already entered the Martial Saint Realm?”Fang Yue’s beautiful eyes were filled with surprise.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “It can be said that at least the famous genius back then was already at the Martial Saint Realm.”

“The famous Yan Jinyao lost to You?”Fang Yue’s eyes widened, as if she could not believe it.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “Yes, he has already become a cripple.”

This was too unbelievable for Fang Yue.

Although she had seen that Qin Yu was extraordinary back then, she had never thought that Qin Yu would spend only three years to overthrow the once famous Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

She had never thought that the present geniuses of Jingdu would all become Qin Yu’s friends.

“There have been too many changes in these three years,”Qin Yu sighed.

“Speaking of which, it’s my fault. I could have woken you up sooner, but... There were too many things.”

This was the truth. Qin Yu was just an ordinary person who climbed up from the bottom.

To this kind of person, resistance was almost always there.

In the past three years, Qin Yu was either on the run or on the road to escape.

“I’m sorry.”Qin Yu looked at Fang Yue, his eyes filled with apology.

Fang Yue smiled and shook her head. “You can’t be blamed. If anyone should be blamed, it should be he teng.”

“He Teng...”

At the mention of this person, a trace of viciousness flashed in Qin Yu’s eyes.

“If I meet him again, i definitely won’t let him off,”Qin Yu said to himself in a low voice.

At this point, Qin Yu looked at Fang Yue and said, “I’ll think of a way to increase your strength as soon as possible. The holy region will be opened immediately. When you go to the holy region, I’ll find the best herbs for you.”

Fang Yue raised her eyebrows. She said half-jokingly and half-seriously, “If you really feel ashamed, then you can take responsibility for me.”

Qin Yu coughed dryly and said with a bit of embarrassment, “You still like to joke.”

“Do you think I’m Joking?”Fang Yue looked straight at Qin Yu with a bit of playfulness in her eyes.

Qin Yu’s face flushed red. He didn’t know how to answer Fang Yue.

“Alright, I’m just joking with you. It’s been three years, why are you still so shy?”Fang Yue burst out laughing.

Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief and laughed sheepishly.

In these three years, Qin Yu had never interacted with any woman. He was still a newbie in this aspect.

After spending almost a day, Qin Yu told Fang Yue the general story.

At this moment, in Qingdi Park, a man and a woman were holding something that looked like a compass, as if they were looking for something.

“This... This is an ancient sage tomb,”the man said in surprise.

“It seems that the elder is right. This ancient star is indeed not simple,”the woman next to him said.

The corner of the man’s mouth curled up into a sneer. He snorted and said, “This ancient sage tomb has existed for at least tens of thousands of years, but it has not been excavated. This is enough to show that this ancient star has completely declined.”

The woman did not utter a word, but she agreed with the man’s words.

The Man took out formation flags from his hands and placed them in different locations.

“Once I summon this tomb, all the treasures inside will belong to us!”The man’s eyes lit up with excitement.

“Hold on.”However, at this moment, the woman stopped the man.

She said in a deep voice, “The ancient sage tomb is full of dangers. Once it is excavated, it will erupt with divine might and cause a great calamity. If anything happens, it will be troublesome.”

The man glanced at the woman and said, “Then what do you mean?”

The woman said indifferently, “Go find a few natives and let them be the bait. If it is safe, we will enter the tomb. If it is not safe, we have countermeasures.”

“Good Idea.”The man couldn’t help but laugh.

“According to the news, the biggest sect in this area seems to be called Heaven Gate. Let them come out.”The woman said.
