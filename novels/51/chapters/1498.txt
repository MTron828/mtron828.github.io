Chapter 1499: Chapter 1499, heading to the northern border together

Qu Zhu’s words were not without reason, and Jue Wu also calmed down.

She looked at Qin Yu and said, “Then how do you plan to deal with it?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Don’t worry. If I really can’t deal with it, I will definitely come and look for you.”

Only then did Jue Wu Pat Qin Yu’s shoulder in satisfaction.

After that, the group of people left the place. They came to a restaurant and sat down.

This Xiao Hai was also a man of character. He liked to drink wine and eat meat, so it was not strange for them to sit together.

“Big Brother Xiao Hai, how’s the situation at the northern border now?”Qu Zhu asked.

When this topic was brought up, Xiao Hai could not help but fall silent.

A moment later, he sighed and said, “It’s very bad. “The methods of the northern lands are even more terrifying than we imagined. If they want to step into the southern region, they don’t need to be near the border at all. According to what I know, they have many teleportation formations, and these formations are extremely brilliant.”

“So Powerful?”Jue Wu could not help but be a little surprised.

Teleportation formations were not easy to set up, and ordinary formations would require a great price.

“That’s right. Due to the environmental problems, the ancestors of the northern lands had long made plans to leave the northern lands. Hence, there was a group of people who focused on researching teleportation formations.”

Xiao Hai picked up the wine and emptied it in one go. He then continued, “The conditions of these formations are not harsh, but there are also restrictions. The restrictions are that they can not be too far away and can only reach our southern region.”

“This is also the reason why the northern lands will target the southern region.”

“The situation is not optimistic. I alone will not be able to stop them.”

Hearing this, Jue Wu immediately raised her hand and said, “I will go too! We will set off tomorrow!”

Xiao Hai said with some surprise, “Are you serious?” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Of course! They are riding on my head. How can I tolerate them!”Jue Wu said angrily.

After saying this, Jue Wu looked at Qin Yu and said, “I’ll leave Mount Hua Ning to you. You have to watch it carefully!”

Qin Yu nodded repeatedly. With his current ability, he couldn’t do much in the northern lands.

Moreover, the people of the northern lands would definitely not just invade the borders. Since they had a teleportation formation, it was very likely that they would appear in every corner.

“Qu Zhu, do you want to come along?”Jue Wu asked.

Qu Zhu laughed bitterly and said, “I’ll leave this matter of saving the people of the world to you guys.”

Seeing that Qu Zhu refused, Xiao Hai did not say anything and only nodded.

“Actually, to resist the northern lands, we still need the support of the Heavenly Cloud Sect.”At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly opened his mouth and said.

As the largest sect, it was impossible for the Heavenly Cloud sect to be in the outside world.

“That’s right.”Xiao Hai agreed. “But based on my understanding of the Heavenly Cloud sect, they won’t make a move unless it’s an all-out war.”

“This dog-faced sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect has gone into seclusion, and now he has some dog-faced first elder to take charge of the Heavenly Cloud sect. That first elder is just a piece of trash, what can he do?”Jue Wu cursed.

Xiao Hai, who was by the side, could not help but laugh bitterly. He said, “There seems to be a reason why the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect can’t make a move.”

“What reason? Isn’t it to protect his sect?”Jue Wu said with some displeasure.

Xiao Hai was silent. A moment later, he sighed and said, “Maybe. The Heavenly Cloud sect is really important to him.”

The few of them did not ask further. After a meal, Xiao Hai wiped his mouth clean and stood up, saying, “Jue Wu, we will set off tomorrow. You Go back and prepare first.”

Jue Wu slapped the table and said, “Okay, no problem!”

Qu Zhu did not stay any longer and left immediately.

After the few of them left, Qin Yu, Jue Wu, and the others returned to Mount Hua Ning.

After this battle, Yongji’s reputation was quite damaged.

Almost everyone in the outside world was discussing this matter. What they were discussing was not only the strength of Qin Yu and Hua Zi, but also Jue Wu and Yongji.

“Although it was a great battle between Qin Yu and Hua Zi, in reality, what was reflected behind the scenes was the battle between Jue Wu and Yongji.”

“That’s right! Qin Yu defeated Hua Zi. This is enough to prove that Jue Wu’s technique is more brilliant than Yongji’s!”

“They’ve never fought before, but they’ve sent out their own juniors to fight side by side.”

For a moment, everyone was sighing with emotion. There were also people who began to analyze who was the strongest among the three ultimate three madmen.

...

Yongji city.

Hua Zi fell to the ground, his face as pale as death.

His Dao Heart had been destroyed, and he probably wouldn’t have any chance of improving in the future.

Looking at the half-dead hua zi on the ground, Yongji’s expression was very unsightly.

The Great Hall, which had always been peaceful, was silent today.

“Foster father, let me go and find that Qin Yu to settle the score! I’ll help you get back your face!”Someone volunteered.

Yong Ji shook his head and said in a deep voice, “There’s no need for that.”

His face had already been damaged. It would be very difficult to get it back.

“I underestimated Qin Yu’s ability.”Yong Ji took a deep breath, leaned back on the chair, and rubbed his temples.

“Foster father, are you going to let those people outside spout nonsense?”

“Yes! They all said that your strength is inferior to Jue Wu, it’s simply nonsense!”

“Foster father, you might as well get rid of Jue Wu!”

Yong Ji’s face was ashen, and his heart was filled with extreme anger.

Get Rid of Jue Wu? It wasn’t that simple.

If he could really get rid of her, he would have done it long ago, why wait until now.

“Alright, you guys can leave first.”Yong Ji waved his hand in annoyance.

No one dared to say anything else. They all bowed and left.

After they left, Yong Ji sat there and pondered for a long time.

His mind was in a mess and he couldn’t think of any solutions.

At this moment, a black-robed man suddenly appeared in front of Yong Ji.

“Mister Yong Ji.”The black-robed man cupped his hands.

Yong Ji coldly glanced at the black-robed man and said, “What are you doing here again? !”

The black-robed man smiled and said, “I’m here to tell you a piece of good news.”

“What good news can you have?”Yong Ji said coldly.

The black-robed man said calmly, “I just received an accurate piece of news. Absolute dance is going to the northern border.”

“So?”Yong Ji’s expression turned cold. “Don’t tell me you want me to make trouble for absolute dance again?”

“Of course not.”The black-robed man shook his head.

“Absolute dance left Mount Hua Ning, but Qin Yu stayed behind. In other words, you can bypass absolute dance and kill Qin Yu.”

When he said this, Yong Ji’s eyes immediately narrowed.

This was a good opportunity.

If there was no Jue Wu, Qin Yu alone was nothing!

“Is your information accurate?”Yong Ji looked at the black-robed man.

The black-robed man smiled and said, “It’s absolutely true. I’m not lying at all.”

Yong Ji narrowed his eyes and did not speak for a long time.

A moment later, he said with a cold face, “Alright, Alright. Then I’ll make a trip to Mount Hua Ning!”

The black-robed man heard this and quickly said, “Then I’ll wait for Mr. Yong Ji’s good news.”

After saying that, the black-robed man did not stay any longer and immediately left the place.
