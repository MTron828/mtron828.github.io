2360 I Want Five Emperor Coins

“Forget it, all of you. Stop arguing. This time, all the aristocratic families are extremely disappointed in us. It might not be long before a truly influential figure arrives. When the time comes, we’ll only take instructions. It’s just that Qin Yu has escaped this time, and we don’t know how to find him.”

Si Qianjing stopped the two’s meaningless argument.

“I know where he is now, but I don’t know how much you’ll pay to buy this information.”

A voice suddenly appeared, making everyone’s expressions change drastically.

A monk appeared with a smile, rubbing his round belly and patting it.

“Where did this monk come from? How dare you come here and play tricks.”

Yao Xi was furious. He reached out to grab him, but his palm passed through his body.

“Dimensional Projection. Just tell me what you want.”

Teng Zixu said with a frown.

“Haha, you’re straightforward enough. I want the Ji family’s Five Emperor Coins. I can sell this information to you. Of course, you don’t have to worry about me, Hua Tian, boasting. The plane can make an oath with the Path of Heaven. It depends on whether you think the Xuanyuan Sword is worth exchanging for the Five Emperor Coins.”

Hua Tian smiled at everyone.

“Ha, if you really know, wouldn’t it be better you go yourself? You can even obtain the Jee family’s treasures.”

Killing intent surged in Yan Yunfan’s pupils. This person could point out the Xuanyuan Sword directly. He seemed to have known about the Ji family for long.

“Hahaha, this sword is too heaven-defying. It’s not a blessing to have it. I only need the Five Emperor Coins.”

“Impossible, it’s the Ji family’s supreme treasure. I can’t agree to your request,” an elder of the Ji family said.

“Hahaha! As an elder of the family, you can’t have a say on such a big matter. Contact me after you’ve discussed it. Brother Zixu, don’t deduce my location. I’ll leave immediately.”

HuaTian threw a voice transmission talisman at him, and his body suddenly turned into countless specks of light and disappeared.

“Sigh, I was only a breath away from deducing his location. This person seemed to have cultivated a divination technique and had a grasp of everything.”

Teng Zixu shook his head.

On another plane, Hua Tian and Nangong Qi sat cross-legged on the ground.

“Whatever my Great Expansion Divine Technique hits, the location will be within my control. When I get the Five Emperor Coins and fuse them with my body, the power of the Great Expansion Divine Technique will increase by five times. You will definitely die in my hands when the time comes.” Hua Tian revealed a strange smile.

“Master, isn’t Qin Yu already suffering severe injury? Why not take this opportunity to kill him in one fell swoop?” Nangong Qi asked curiously. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“If Jue Wu, by his side, were to go all out, I would also be injured. And for some reason, no matter how I deduce, there would always be a vague killing intent. That killing intent is as deadly as a poisonous snake. Perhaps someone is protecting him in the dark, so I can’t take the risk. It’s best to sell this information.”

“What if the people from the Holy Region disagree?”

“As long as they know how terrifying the Xuanyuan Sword is, they will agree.”

Hua Tian smiled and patted his belly.

…

At this moment, Qin Yu took the opportunity to cultivate madly.

With the Green Spirit Tree’s assistance, he madly absorbed the spiritual essence mountain he obtained from the Jee family.

Under the circulation of the Traceless Immortal Scripture, that spiritual essence turned into an ordinary stone at a terrifying speed.

“Alright, it’s finally completed! Spirit Gathering Formation!”

After a few days of continuous endeavor, Wang Feng finally completed an enormous formation.

In an instant, countless spiritual essences were attracted to the formation.

The spinning accelerated, blasting toward Qin Yu at a terrifying speed.

Coupled with the Spirit Gathering Formation, Qin Yu’s cultivation speed sped up again.

A spiritual energy turbulence appeared in the surroundings. Elder Guai, Jue Wu, and the others, cultivating by the side, could not even withstand the tide-like spiritual energy turbulence.

“D*mn it, this kid is really a pervert. Why is his body like a bottomless pit?”

Jue Wu stared at Qin Yu in the center but saw that he did not seem to be filled up at all.

Time passed quickly, and Qin Yu slowly perfected his Glazed Holy Body.

While cultivating, he was surprised to discover Yun Zhilan’s heavenly might had crushed most of his bones with extreme pressure.

And the remaining skull and a small section of the spine seemed to have turned even greener.

Qin Yu’s divine sense could sense that the remaining holy bones seemed to have been tempered again under this pressure.

Regardless of the hardness or the amount of spiritual energy absorbed, the incremental had almost doubled.

Initially, he had absorbed 10,000 pieces of spiritual essence and could almost grow a complete rib.

However, he absorbed almost the same amount of spiritual energy this time, but only half a rib could grow.

“Could it be that the Glazed Holy Body can continue to evolve in battle? This was something that other holy bodies can’t do.”

Qin Yu shook his head. He did not expect it to be a blessing in disguise.

In five days, Qin Yu’s holy body had grown by 80% under the terrifying absorption speed of spiritual energy.

His bones and blood vessels had grown completely, and the remaining muscles slowly extended.

He slowly clenched his fists and felt a boundless power transmitting to his limbs and bones.

He even felt that he could shatter the space before him with a punch with all his might.

All of a sudden, the speed of absorbing the spiritual energy slowed down.

He stood up in confusion, only to see everyone looking at him in a daze.

Behind him, the mountain of spirit essence had already turned into an ordinary stone.

“F*ck! I’ve finished absorbing the spiritual energy?”

Qin Yu was also stunned.

Even all the disciples of an aristocratic family cultivating together for a year of the Path of Heaven might not finish absorbing this mountain of spirit essence. He did not expect to have absorbed it in such a short time.

“Qin Yu, is your holy body completed?”

Ji Yue asked somewhat curiously. Her divine sense swept toward Qin Yu, and she was as if sensing a terrifying beast, making her tremble with fear.

“Only 80% completed.”

Qin Yu shook his head.

On his back, Qin Yu placed his hand on the life spiritual essence. Instantly, a terrifying amount of vital energy entered his body.

The vital energy did not allow him to grow muscles and organs, but it seeped into his bones, filling his entire body with surging vitality.

Even if he were severely injured, his Glazed Holy Body would recover on its own in a few breaths.

Following that, Qin Yu absorbed 80% of the life spiritual essence.

Then he ate 80% of the fruit the Green Spirit Tree bore previously and poured the Spirit Gathering Holy Pill into his mouth like eating rice.

He had to cherish this rare time of cultivation. Perhaps Xi Menn would not have died if he had been a little stronger.

When he thought of Xi Menn, he felt an indescribable pain.

Their conversation did not exceed ten sentences, but they were like old friends. How could he ever repay this old friend’s kindness?
