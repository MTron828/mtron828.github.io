Chapter 957: Chapter 957 was known throughout the world

The entire prison was empty.

Tian Xuehong’s expression didn’t look good either.

His absorption had just begun, and he didn’t expect to be interrupted.

Most importantly, he didn’t bring his white bone army.

“Interesting... these ants actually want to resist.”Tian Xuehong grinned and let out a cold smile.

“Alright, then kill them all!”The Sky Blood Rainbow clenched his hands together!

...

When Qin Yu woke up, he was already on a mountain.

This mountain wasn’t big, and it looked like a temple.

Temple-like houses sat on this mountain one after another.

Qin Yu opened his eyes in a daze. Just as he tried to get up, he felt waves of intense pain all over his body.

“Where is this?”Qin Yu looked around, his eyes filled with confusion.

“You’re awake!”Zhuang Teng patted Qin Yu’s shoulder forcefully. Qin Yu immediately grimaced in pain.

“Be careful!”Yao Meng could not help but say.

Zhuang teng touched his nose and said somewhat embarrassedly, “I was too excited...”

Qin Yu waved his hand. He sat up from the bed with difficulty and said, “Where is this?”

Yao Meng explained, “This is nine pinnacles mountain. It is also senior Xu Huaigu’s residence.”

“Nine Pinnacles Mountain? Xu Huaigu?”Qin Yu’s brows furrowed even more tightly.

Yao Meng grunted and said, “We have robbed the JINGDU martial arts association’s prison. They will definitely not let this go.”

“At the moment, the only one who can help us is senior Xu Huaigu.”

Qin Yu could not help but sigh slightly.

In the end, he still brought the trouble to Xu Huaigu.

“Thank you for your help.”Qin Yu cupped his hands and then asked, “Are the others alright?”

“They’re fine. You can rest assured and recuperate here.”Zhuang Teng waved his hand.

Qin Yu lay on the bed, his face could not help but be filled with worry.

He had indeed escaped, but this was probably just the beginning.

“The Jingdu Martial Arts Association will definitely send a martial saint to take him,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“We should think of a way.”

“Think of a way? Other than senior Xu Huaigu, how can there be a martial saint?”Zhuang Teng shook his head.

Qin Yu did not say anything. He thought for a moment and suddenly thought of immortal crane.

If immortal crane was called over, it would probably be able to resist the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, right?

But after thinking about it, Qin Yu finally gave up on this idea.

Xianhe and the others could be considered to be in a paradise. It was probably not appropriate to disrupt their lives for no reason. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Just recuperate well. We will think of a way,”Yao Meng comforted.

Qin Yu nodded and didn’t say anything.

The Qi/spiritual energy here wasn’t very rich, but compared to the JINGDU martial arts association’s prison, this place was already considered pretty good.

In the next few days, Qin Yu’s body and mind were fully recovered.

Under everyone’s care, Qin Yu’s injuries recovered very quickly.

Perhaps it was because of the appearance of the disciples of the secret realm that caused these high and mighty young masters of Jingdu to lower their proud heads.

Zhuang Teng brought the divine sword, and Yao Meng took out all the precious herbs in the family to treat Qin Yu’s illness.

Three days later, Qin Yu’s injuries were almost healed.

He stood up and walked out of the house. The first thing he saw was a huge Bodhi tree.

Everyone gathered under the tree, and sitting in the middle was Xu Huaigu.

Qin Yu walked quickly to the tree.

“This junior, Qin Yu, greets senior Xu Huaigu,”Qin Yu cupped his hands and said.

Xu Huaigu nodded slightly and waved his hand, “Sit.”

“Qin Yu, you’re good. You almost killed a martial saint. You’re too awesome!”Chang Mang patted Qin Yu’s shoulder forcefully.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “I barely defeated him at the cost of my life. Moreover, he was the weakest martial saint...”

“This is enough. Since ancient times, no one has been able to cross this ditch. You’re already amazing.”Xu Huaigu said quietly.

Qin Yu immediately cupped his hands and said, “The truly amazing one is you. You can clearly choose to live a better life, but you are willing to risk your life to fight against them.”

Xu Huaigu shook his head and said, “I’m afraid that is all I can do.”

“Senior, you are the first person to step into the martial saint realm today! That is a first-class genius!”Kong Yun said.

Xu Huaigu shook his head and said, “Those who have stepped into the martial saint stage may not be geniuses. There are many people with higher talent than me.”

“If I had known that stepping into the martial saint stage would cause unnecessary trouble, I would rather stay in the martial marquis stage forever.”

When everyone heard this, they instantly fell into silence.

However, Qin Yu heard something from these words.

Those who had stepped into the martial saint stage might not be geniuses?

In other words, one did not rely on talent to step into the Martial Saint Realm?

When he thought of this, Qin Yu cupped his hands towards Xu Huaigu and said, “Senior, you said that one did not rely on talent to step into the martial saint realm. Then what should it be? State of mind? Comprehension? Or Luck?”

“What you said has nothing to do with me.”Xu Huaigu shook his head.

Qin Yu cupped his hands and said, “I once tried to build a carriage behind closed doors. Later on, I began to experience the world. However, I was unable to step into the martial saint realm. I did not even have the slightest intention to step into the martial saint realm.”

“Now, I am a little confused. I don’t know what method to use to enter the martial saint realm. Please give me some guidance, senior.”

Xu Huaigu’s gaze landed on Qin Yu.

His pair of deep eyes seemed to be able to see through Qin Yu.

The surrounding people also looked at Xu Huaigu in unison as if they were waiting for his guidance.

At this moment, Xu Huaigu slowly stood up.

He slowly said a few words, “Once you comprehend Dao, the world will know.”

After saying this, Xu Huaigu slowly left.

“Once you comprehend Dao, the world will know...”Qin Yu frowned and repeated this sentence repeatedly, as if he wanted to get something out of this sentence.

“What exactly does this sentence mean?”The people beside him could not help but be puzzled.

“Seriously, can’t senior Xu be more specific? !”

“Some things have to be comprehended by oneself, what do you know? !”

Qin Yu did not say a word. He rubbed his chin and his mind was filled with this sentence.

Once one comprehended dao, the world would know...

For the entire day, Qin Yu’s brows were slightly furrowed. This sentence filled his entire mind.

“Alright, don’t think about it anymore. Your body hasn’t recovered yet. Recuperate properly,”Chang Mang said carelessly.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Alright.”

Even though that was the case, Qin Yu still couldn’t help but ponder over these words.
