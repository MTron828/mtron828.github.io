2089 The Mysterious Teng Family

Saintess Gu nodded with a smile. Her fairy-like temperament was dazzling, and her seductive eyes revealed a noble internal qi.

Yao Xi patted Qin Yu’s shoulder. “I didn’t expect Brother Qin to come as well.”

Qin Yu smiled at Yao Xi but did not say anything.

Qin Yu did not like Yao Xi. He looked elegant and refined, but in fact, he had a darker side to his personality.

“Brother Qin’s internal qi… seems to have become much denser,” Saintess Gu suddenly said in surprise.

Qin Yu could not help but feel shocked.

He had clearly restrained his internal qi, but Saintess Gu still saw through him.

“That’s right. I’ve indeed made a breakthrough.” Qin Yu nodded. There was nothing to hide about this matter, so he might as well tell the truth.

“Brother Qin, you’re really humble,” Saintess Gu smiled and said.

“It seems that the Traceless Immortal Scripture has indeed brought you quite a lot of benefits,” Yao Xi said casually.

Qin Yu was silent. He now felt even more disgusted with Yao Xi.

“Qin Yu!”

At this moment, another voice sounded.

Looking over, he saw Holy Son Jiang running over hurriedly.

He ran all the way to Qin Yu, then glared at him and said, “You actually lied to me! Did you take away the Traceless Immortal Scripture?”

Qin Yu coughed briefly and dryly, then said with a smile, “What are you talking about? When did I lie to you?”

“The news is spreading outside. The Traceless Immortal Scripture is in your hands! D*mn it! I almost died when I entered the Chaos Grave!” Holy Son Jiang said angrily.

Qin Yu spread his hands and said, “I’ve never admitted it. They can say whatever they want. It has nothing to do with me.”

“It’s definitely with you!” Holy Son Jiang glared at him. “Hurry up and return my Jiang family’s Mysterious Heavenly Mirror. You promised me that!”

Qin Yu coughed briefly and dryly, and said with an awkward smile, “Holy Son Jiang, we had an exchange in peace back then. How can you take it back now…”

“It was a peaceful exchange, but you also promised to return the Mysterious Heavenly Mirror to me!” Holy Son Jiang glared at him.

“I can return it to you, but not now. If I return it to you now, wouldn’t that cost my life?” Qin Yu said with a smile.

His face, filled with anger just now, was replaced with a cunning expression.

He nudged Qin Yu with his shoulder and said, “You can use the Mysterious Heavenly Mirror first, but I have a condition. How about you lend me the Traceless Immortal Scripture later?”

Qin Yu could not help but break out in cold sweat.

This Holy Son Jiang was indeed sinister. That angry look just now was all an act.

“Holy Son Jiang, how have you been?” At this moment, Saintess Gu greeted him.

Only then did Holy Son Jiang see Saintess Gu. He let out a cracked voice and put on a warm smile. He smiled and said, “Saintess Gu, you’re here too! Holy Son Yao was here too! Long time no see!”

“Brother Jiang, your Jiang family has helped Qin Yu a lot this time. If it weren’t for your Jiang family’s help, I’m afraid Qin Yu wouldn’t have been able to take away the Traceless Immortal Scripture, right?”

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Yao Xi’s words were full of motives. On the surface, it seemed like casual talk, but in reality, it was full of traps.

However, this Holy Son Jiang was not the type to be at a disadvantage. He laughed loudly and said, “Didn’t you hear that just now? We had a peaceful exchange. If you’re talking about helping, I feel that you, Holy Son Yao, should be the one to bear the responsibility!”

“Me? What responsibility do I bear? My Yao family and Qin Yu have always had a grudge,” Yao Xi said coldly.

“Qin Yu, do you have a grudge against the Yao family?” Holy Son Jiang pretended to be surprised and said. “I thought you two are friends!”

At this point, Holy Son Jiang paused for a moment before he continued, “That’s weird. I heard that you, Yao Xi, kept rejecting Si Liuhe’s conditions, which caused everyone to be unable to enter the Chaos Grave. I thought you were Qin Yu’s best friend, and you were stalling for time for him!”

Upon hearing this, Yao Xi’s face instantly darkened.

He snorted coldly and turned to leave without saying anything.

Looking at Yao Xi’s departing figure, Holy Son Jiang could not help but spit.

“You, a petty and cynical villain. I’ll deal with you sooner or later!” Holy Son Jiang cursed in his heart.

After Yao Xi left, Holy Son Jiang patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said with a smile, “Brother Qin, I won’t disturb you two. Don’t forget our agreement. It’s decided.”

Without waiting for Qin Yu to reject, Holy Son Jiang ran away.

After Holy Son Jiang left, Saintess Gu smiled and said, “Brother Qin, let’s have a drink together.”

Qin Yu did not reject. The two immediately sat at the stone table.

Looking at this grand event, Qin Yu could not help but sigh with emotion. “To be honest, I have never heard of this Teng family, even though it is one of the nine great aristocratic families. Compared to the other eight families, it does not seem so…”

He didn’t finish his sentence, but his meaning was self-evident.

Saintess Gu took a sip of wine and smiled. “Yes, the Teng family is relatively low-key, but their strength is the most mysterious.”

“I can tell.” Qin Yu nodded. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Saintess Gu said in surprise, “You can tell? How did you know?”

“That Teng Zixu is known as the number one person of the younger generation,” Qin Yu said with a smile. “He’s also the first to step into the True Saint realm. This is enough to show how terrifying the Teng family is.”

At this point, Qin Yu glanced at the small world again and said, “What shocked me, even more, was that this small world is almost no different from the outside world. It doesn’t seem to have been artificially created at all. Instead, it seems to have been created by heaven and the earth itself.”

Saintess Gu’s beautiful eyes glanced around. She stared at Qin Yu and said, “Brother Qin, this small world was indeed created by the ancestors of the Teng family. The subsequent generation called it Emperor Teng.”

Qin Yu nodded and did not think much about it.

However, what Saintess Gu said next caused Qin Yu’s expression to change slightly.

She looked at Qin Yu and continued, “Brother Qin, have you ever thought about who opened up this Holy Region?”

Qin Yu opened her mouth and said, “Could it be that this Holy Region was also man-made?”

“I don’t know.” Saintess Gu shook her head. “This is just my guess. Rumor has it that after becoming the Immortal Emperors, they will break away from the existing dao techniques and create their own dao techniques of heaven and earth. In that case, will they form a new world after they create the dao technique of heaven and earth?”

Qin Yu’s eyes widened. At this moment, countless thoughts flashed through his mind like golden light!

“The Immortal Emperor has already broken away from the existing dao technique. It means… The so-called dao techniques of the Holy Region and even the existing universe could also be created by a certain Immortal Emperor?” Qin Yu murmured, the shock in his eyes could be seen at a glance.
