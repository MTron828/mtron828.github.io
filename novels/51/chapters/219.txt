Chapter 220: Endless Dark Energy! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

At the moment, Qin Yu was lacking herbs. It would be best if he could borrow this old man’s help.

The ancestor was silent for a moment before saying, “The path of cultivation can’t be transferred, at least not with my ability.”

“Can’t be transferred?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel stunned.

The ancestor nodded and said, “That’s right. There are no shortcuts to the path of cultivation. I can’t pass on my internal qi to you.”

“Could it be that there isn’t even an Inner Strength Grandmaster in the Earth Fiend Valley?” At this moment, the ancestor suddenly changed the topic and looked at Qin Yu coldly.

Qin Yu sighed and said, “Times have changed. It’s already the age of chaos. Our cultivation path is extremely difficult.”

“Difficult?” The ancestor snorted coldly.

“There are so many women in the world. They can all become the nourishment of the Earth Fiend Valley,” the ancestor said coldly.

When he heard this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse inside.

The Earth Fiend Valley was really disgusting!

He didn’t know how many women they had to exploit to attain their current achievements!

Qin Yu continued to lie, “Now, everything is under the supervision of the government. How can women be so easy to find?”

“You can’t find them?” The ancestor’s expression turned cold.

“I remember that the Earth Fiend Valley raises a group of women, right? The newborns they give birth to are the purest cultivation nutrients!” The ancestor continued to say.

When he heard this, Qin Yu almost couldn’t hold in his anger!

If it wasn’t for his lack of strength, Qin Yu would definitely slap this old b*stard to death!

“What a b*stard. Sooner or later, I will make a trip to the Earth Fiend Valley.” Qin Yu cursed inside.

Even though that was the case, Qin Yu still maintained a cordial pretense and said, “The Earth Fiend Valley is facing a disaster of extermination. Those women were all saved by Qin Yu!”

“The current Earth Fiend Valley is suffering!”

Grief flashed across the ancestor’s face.

He sighed and said, “I really didn’t expect that the Earth Fiend Valley would fall to such a state.”

“It’s not like there’s no other way.” Qin Yu raised his head and said.

“I’m the genius of the current generation of the Earth Fiend Valley! My cultivation speed is beyond imagination! It’s just that I lack dark energy!”

“If you are willing to offer me dark energy, I believe that I will be able to become an Inner Strength Grandmaster very quickly and kill Qin Yu!”

Qin Yu said these words with confidence. He didn’t blush and his heart didn’t race.

The ancestor frowned slightly.

He rubbed his chin and thought for a moment before saying in a sullen voice, “If that’s the case, then my strength will definitely be diminished...”

“Isn’t that just what I want?!” Qin Yu shouted wildly in his mind!

As long as he absorbed all the dark energy of this old man, he could slap him to death. That would be the best of both worlds!

“As long as the Earth Fiend Valley survives this crisis, you will still have a chance to see the light of day!” Qin Yu said anxiously.

“If the Earth Fiend Valley is destroyed, I’m afraid you will never be able to leave this place!”

“Besides, with your omnipotence, as long as you leave this place, you’ll be able to reach the peak state at any time!”

Upon hearing Qin Yu’s words, the ancestor seemed to be slightly moved.

Qin Yu struck while the iron was hot and said, “There’s no time to think too much about it! Qin Yu can destroy the Earth Fiend Valley at any time!”

The ancestor nodded slightly and said, “Perhaps this is the only way.”

Qin Yu was instantly overjoyed!

This old man was still quite easy to fool!

At this moment, the ancestor suddenly thought of something.

He raised his hand, and a huge force instantly pressed down on Qin Yu’s body!

In an instant, Qin Yu’s entire divine sense was slapped to the ground with a bang!

There was another wave of intense pain! Qin Yu grimaced in pain!

“You aren’t lying to me, are you?” The ancestor said coldly.

Qin Yu hurriedly said, “How could I... I really want to save you!”

The ancestor didn’t say anything. He raised his finger and a dark light instantly enveloped Qin Yu.

As the light enveloped Qin Yu, he felt as if he was about to be seen through by the ancestor!

Qin Yu’s expression changed. He hurriedly restrained his spiritual energy and tried his best to suppress the internal qi while releasing the dark energy!

Half a minute later, the ancestor retracted the ray of light.

He nodded slightly and said, “Alright, we’ll do as you say. I happen to be short of a servant. You’re a good choice.”

Servant?

F * ck him!

Although Qin Yu was extremely unwilling, it wasn’t Qin Yu’s turn to make the decision.

The ancestor pointed with his finger, and a pitch-black dot of light fell into Qin Yu’s spiritual sense.

“In order to prevent you from betraying me, I left a mark in your spiritual sense.”

“As long as you dare to disobey my orders, I can take your life at the drop of a hat,” said the ancestor coldly.

Qin Yu’s expression instantly turned pale!

If that was the case, how could Qin Yu kill him?

“Of course, this mark has its benefits. You can absorb my dark energy at any time,” said the ancestor indifferently.

Qin Yu hurriedly nodded and said, “Thank you, ancestor! In that case, I won’t waste any more time!”

The ancestor nodded slightly. With a wave of his palm, Qin Yu’s spiritual sense was pushed out.

After the spiritual sense returned to his body, Qin Yu also sat up from the ground. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Mr. Qin, are you okay?” Yao Qing said somewhat anxiously.

Qin Yu shook his head. He stroked his chin and couldn’t help but be a little worried.

If the mark left in his spiritual sense wasn’t erased, Qin Yu might really become this old b*stard’s slave.

“That’s right!”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of the inheritance left by his father!

“My father’s strength should be above this old b*stard, right?” Qin Yu thought inside.

He left Qin Yu with an incomparably vast inheritance. Perhaps he could find a way to erase the mark!

Thinking of this, Qin Yu didn’t dare to waste any more time. He hurriedly closed his eyes and searched for a way to erase the mark.

Very quickly, a ray of light flashed through Qin Yu’s mind.

Following that, countless memories surged into Qin Yu’s mind.

“As expected, it can be erased!” After sensing this memory, Qin Yu was instantly overjoyed!

As long as he could erase this mark, Qin Yu no longer had to worry about this ancestor of the Earth Fiend Valley!

“I really wonder who my father is,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

From what the inheritance showed, his father was practically an omnipotent existence.

As long as Qin Yu’s mind moved, he would be able to obtain the corresponding cultivation technique.

This technique was heaven-defying.

“Forget about him. Let’s first absorb this old b*stard’s dark energy first,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

This old b*stard’s dark energy was as vast as the sea. If he could absorb all of it, Qin Yu’s strength would definitely rise to a higher level!

Therefore, he didn’t waste any more time. Instead, he sat down cross-legged and absorbed this ancestor’s dark energy through the imprint.

Endless dark energy surged into Qin Yu’s body through the mark.

The vastness of this dark energy far exceeded Qin Yu’s imagination!

His entire body was instantly enveloped by the dark energy! The internal qi in his body was increasing at a speed visible to the naked eye!
