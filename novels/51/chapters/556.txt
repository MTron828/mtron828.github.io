Chapter 557: Gu Canghai’s Attack! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Gu Canghai swept his cold gaze across the crowd and slowly said, “The Saint Confucian Sect has never sent out such a large-scale crusade against any sect, and no one has ever dared to challenge the Saint Confucian Sect’s prestige!”

“And the cause of all this is all because of Qin Yu!”

As he spoke, Gu Canghai slowly stood up.

He swept his gaze over everyone and coldly said, “Listen carefully. This time, when we head to the Green Moon Villa, we will kill anyone we see! The Saint Confucian Sect wants to use this to tell the world the consequences of provoking us!”

“Yes!” Everyone immediately shouted in unison.

...

The Jingdu Martial Arts Association had a place for imprisoning prisoners.

These prisoners all had powerful strength, and there was no lack of Martial Marquises!

And now, in the depths of this prison, there was an ordinary person without any cultivation. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

She was locked in a single cell, and every day, she ate all sorts of delicacies.

Not only that, but there were all kinds of top-notch herbs in her food.

But even so, her face was still pale, and she looked extremely weak!

This woman was none other than Yan Ruoxue!

“Miss Yan, it’s time.”

A Martial Marquis walked in from outside the door.

He held a needle in his hand and walked in front of Yan Ruoxue.

A trace of fear flashed across Yan Ruoxue’s pale face.

“Miss Yan, please bear with it. Don’t worry, it won’t take your life.” The Martial Marquis said with a smile.

Then, the Martial Marquis raised his hand and Yan Ruoxue’s figure floated in the air. She was unable to move!

The Martial Marquis immediately took the syringe and stabbed it into Yan Ruoxue’s fair neck fiercely!

Fresh blood flowed out along the syringe.

Yan Ruoxue’s face instantly became even paler, and the anguish on her face was even more indescribable.

“Alright, Miss Yan.” After drawing the blood, he released Yan Ruoxue.

Yan Ruoxue looked at the Martial Marquis coldly and said, “What exactly do you want!”

The Martial Marquis smiled and said, “Miss Yan, don’t worry. We just need your blood. As long as you cooperate obediently, we won’t hurt you.”

“When will you let me go?” Yan Ruoxue asked coldly.

“This... not necessarily, Hehe.” After the Martial Marquis said these words, he no longer paid attention to Yan Ruoxue and walked out directly.

No one expected that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association would treat Yan Ruoxue like this.

...

Green Moon Villa.

It was unusually lively today.

Zhen Yue sat in the hall and her eyes were filled with worry.

As long as there was any movement outside, Zhen Yue couldn’t help but look outside.

It was because today was the day that the Saint Confucian Sect came to crusade.

“Why hasn’t Mr. Qin come out yet?” The worry in Zhen Yue’s heart grew more and more intense.

At this moment, waves of powerful internal qi approached the Green Moon Villa!

This internal qi was extremely powerful, and almost everyone in the Green Moon Villa felt its terrifying pressure!

Zhen Yue stood up abruptly and walked out quickly.

Soon, more than ten people entered the Green Moon Villa in large strides.

“Who... Who are you?” Zhen Yue braced herself and asked.

“Gu Canghai,” the leader said coldly.

Hearing the name Gu Canghai, everyone was so scared that their faces turned pale!

“Gu... Gu Canghai, the Sect Master of Saint Confucian Sect!”

“They’re really here...”

Gu Canghai glanced at the crowd and asked coldly, “Where’s Qin Yu?”

Zhen Yue suppressed the fear in her heart and took a deep breath. “Sect Master Gu, Mr. Qin isn’t here. May I know why you’re looking for him?”

“He’s not here?” Gu Canghai narrowed his eyes.

Then, he sneered. “Then I’ll kill all of you!”

The crowd panicked!

Facing Gu Canghai, they didn’t have any means to fight back!

“Wait!”

At this moment, Zhen Yue suddenly shouted.

She gritted her teeth and said, “Mr. Gu, I know that the Saint Confucian Sect wants the Iceheart Lake. I... I can give it to you.”

Gu Canghai stroked his beard and sneered. “After I kill you, the Iceheart Lake will be mine!”

After saying this, Gu Canghai ordered, “Do it! Leave no one alive!”

“I can tell you where Qin Yu is!”

At this moment, someone in the crowd suddenly shouted.

Gu Canghai waved his hand.

Then, he asked coldly, “Do you know where Qin Yu is?”

“Yes... I know.” The martial artist said with a trembling voice.

“Take me there.” A trace of viciousness flashed in Gu Canghai’s eyes.

The martial artist didn’t dare to say anything and quickly cupped his hands, “Please come with me...”

Zhen Yue watched this scene with anger.

However, she couldn’t do anything to Gu Canghai and could only let him be.

Gu Canghai led his men and strode toward Qin Yu’s residence.

At this moment, Qin Yu was trying to break through to the rank of Martial Marquis.

He could clearly feel that his spiritual energy was enough to help him step into the rank of Martial Marquis.

However, every time he tried, he failed.

“Sigh.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh slightly.

“Everyone says that stepping into the rank of Martial Marquis requires an opportunity. It seems to be true.” Qin Yu frowned tightly.

It was too difficult to forcefully break through.

At this moment, the door was suddenly opened!

Then, Qin Yu felt a strong killing intent burst in!

Looking over, he saw Gu Canghai standing at the door coldly.

“Qin Yu...” the moment he saw Qin Yu, Gu Canghai clenched his fist!

Gu Canghai hated Qin Yu to the bone!

“Gu Canghai, you’re finally here.” Qin Yu slowly stood up from the ground.

Looking at Gu Canghai, Qin Yu felt somewhat worried.

Not being able to successfully step into the Martial Marquis realm wasn’t good news for Qin Yu.

“If it really doesn’t work, I can only try to forcefully step into the Martial Marquis realm using a secret technique again.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

Gu Canghai said coldly, “I want to see who else can come and save you this time!”

Qin Yu stood up and said, “It’s true that no one can save me, but I’m afraid it won’t be that easy for you to kill me.”

“Is that so?” Upon Gu Canghai’s internal qi instantly erupted!

This terrifying internal qi sent the surrounding people flying!
