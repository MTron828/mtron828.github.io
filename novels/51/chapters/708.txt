Chapter 709: The Absorption of the Power of Creation Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Looking at the scene in front of him, Qin Yu’s eyes widened.

In this room, other than a huge array platform, there were walls filled with bottles and jars!

There seemed to be something flowing inside this jar. It was like internal qi, but also like liquid. They seemed to have life consciousness as they squirmed inside the jar.

At a glance, there were at least tens of thousands of such jars!

“These... are good fortune?” Qin Yu murmured softly.

For some reason, he felt uncomfortable.

Sect Master Hu got up from the ground. Beside his array platform, there was a huge earthen jar.

At this moment, there was some golden internal qi in the earthen jar.

“Qin Yu, you killed my son. I must take revenge!” Sect Master Hu gritted his teeth and said.

Although he had said those harsh words, Sect Master Hu was very lacking in confidence. Even his body was trembling.

Qin Yu ignored his harsh words. Instead, he pointed at the jar on the surrounding wall and said, “This is fate? What kind of object is this and how should it be used?”

Sect Master Hu was stunned. He said angrily, “Qin Yu! You broke into my house and killed my son, yet you act as if nothing happened. You aren’t taking me seriously!”

Qin Yu frowned. He took a step forward and suddenly stretched out his golden palm.

This palm grabbed Sect Master Hu’s neck and lifted him into the air.

The terrifying qi force immediately grabbed Sect Master Hu’s life vein! It made him unable to move!

“You aren’t my match at all. What are you boasting about?” Qin Yu said coldly.

Sect Master Hu struggled with all his might. His eyes were filled with terror!

He was also a Martial Marquis, but in front of Qin Yu, he was like a three-year-old child. He didn’t have the strength to fight back!

Qin Yu let go of Sect Master Hu and threw him to the ground.

Then, Qin Yu patted his palm and said coldly, “If you don’t want to die, then answer my question honestly.”

Sect Master Hu was also afraid. He got up from the ground and braced himself, saying, “Tell me.”

Qin Yu pointed at the bottles and jars around him and said, “What exactly are these?”

Sect Master Hu whispered, “These are the powers of creation that are drawn from the bodies of humans...”

“Powers of creation? What are those things?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes.

Sect Master Hu explained, “Powers of creation are an extremely strange divine power. I don’t know how to explain it either, but this power brings great benefits.”

Qin Yu motioned for Sect Master Hu to continue.

Sect Master Hu coughed and continued, “I don’t know if you’ve heard of the power of faith.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “It’s said to be a kind of religious power.”

“To be more precise, it’s the power of human faith. This power is both pure and terrifying!” Sect Master Hu said.

“As for this power of creation, it’s the power formed by Creation. This power isn’t limited to humans, but all objects that have fate will produce the power of creation.”

Hearing these words, Qin Yu couldn’t help but be shocked.

There was actually such a strange power in the world? It was simply unheard of!

What happened these few days had blown Qin Yu’s mind!

“In other words... The good fortune of Qing City has really been absorbed by you?” Qin Yu frowned and asked.

Sect Master Hu didn’t hide it. He nodded and said, “Indeed. Most of the power of creation you see before you comes from Qing City.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He lowered his head and looked at the jar on the array platform.

Inside the jar was a golden internal qi.

“Is this my own internal qi?” Qin Yu asked.

Sect Master Hu nodded and said, “Yes, but I only absorbed a part of it...”

Qin Yu was even more shocked. He picked up the jar and examined it carefully.

The so-called power of creation in the jar was balls of internal qi.

The internal qi didn’t even have any fluctuations. They were no different from air.

“What’s the use of this power of internal qi?” Qin Yu asked.

Sect Master Hu said, “The power of internal qi is simply fate. The power brought by fate is endless.”

“Not only can it increase a person’s cultivation, it can even change a person’s fate and upper limit! It is one of the most powerful powers and also one of the most precious powers!”

Qin Yu was immediately even more shocked.

There was actually such a technique in the world?

It was one thing to forcefully take another person’s cultivation, but he could actually forcefully take another person’s fate?

“What are the consequences for a person who has his power of creation taken away?” Qin Yu asked.

Sect Master Hu quickly said, “Once the power of creation is taken away, a person will be especially unfortunate. It takes a long time to recover...”

Speaking up to this point, Sect Master Hu hurriedly explained, “I have only absorbed ten years of Qing City’s fortune. Next year will be the last year!”

Qin Yu swept his gaze around him. He said somewhat confusedly, “Then why did you choose to stay in Qing City? Why didn’t you choose another city?”

Sect Master Hu frowned, as if he had some misgivings.

Qin Yu said coldly, “If you don’t want to die, I will take your life now.”

Sect Master Hu was helpless. He could only say, “In many cities, it’s impossible to seize the power of creation. It is very difficult to seize the fate of a city. There are many conditions to be met.”

“For example, the city must be a new city. It must have a very long fate. There also has to be great restrictions on the terrain...”

“I have searched for many years, but only Qing City meets the requirements...”

Qin Yu still had some doubts. He couldn’t help but ask, “Then why didn’t you seize an individual? Like a genius or a young master. Their fortune must be very good, right?”

Sect Master Hu hummed in gratitude and said, “Normally, that is indeed the case, but in reality, it isn’t that easy to operate.”

“When it comes to seizing an individual, it is very easy to be discovered.”

“Moreover, the fortune of a large family is usually a large amount. With my ability, I can’t forcefully seize it, and it might even invite disaster.”

Qin Yu’s expression was a little displeased.

He said with a cold expression, “In other words, this spell of yours can only bully the weak and fear the strong? Seize the fortune of the weak?”

“Yes... Yes, that’s more or less what it means...” Sect Master Hu muttered in a low voice.

Qin Yu suddenly had the urge to slap Sect Master Hu to death.

The fortune of ordinary people was already bad enough to begin with, yet it was still being secretly seized by this kind of warlock. Life was really too difficult for them. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Return this fortune.” Qin Yu looked at the wall full of bottles and jars, and couldn’t help but frown.

Sect Master Hu said awkwardly, “Once the power of creation is absorbed, it’s impossible to return it...”

“Just like the power of faith, it flows in one direction.”

Qin Yu’s brows furrowed even more tightly.

He stood there for a long time before sighing helplessly, “Sigh, then I can only endure the pain of absorbing this power of creation.”
