Qin Yu nodded.

Perhaps this was the Pavilion Master’s goal.

In the entire meeting, perhaps only Qin Yu dared to speak.

And it was precisely because of this characteristic of Qin Yu’s personality that the Pavilion Master brought him to the meeting.

It had to be said that although this meeting was short, Qin Yu could be considered to have established his reputation among these people.

“I think you will have some free time from now on,” the Pavilion Master said with a smile.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “If I die now, I believe the higher-ups will hold them accountable.”

“That’s right.” The Pavilion Master nodded his head approvingly.

“Pavilion Master, did you already guess that I would do this?” Qin Yu asked doubtfully.

The Pavilion Master smiled and didn’t comment.

The two of them walked out of the venue. Just as they reached the door, they saw Qu Xie standing there coldly.

He and Xia Hang walked to Qin Yu and said with narrowed eyes, “Qin Yu, how dare you?! Do you know the consequences of your actions?!”

“Of course I know,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“From today onwards, the power of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association will definitely be reduced. Everyone will have the opportunity to participate in cultivation!”

Xie Qu sneered. He narrowed his eyes and said, “Qin Yu, you are too naive. Your words today jeopardized the interests of all the aristocratic families.”

“Do you think they will let you off?”

Qin Yu sneered. “If I was afraid, I wouldn’t have come.”

“Well then!” Qu Xie gave Qin Yu a thumbs up.

He said coldly, “Don’t think that we won’t have a chance to kill you. There are plenty of opportunities. We’ll see.”

After saying that, Qu Xie turned around and left.

Qin Yu looked at Qu Xie’s back and sneered.

“If nothing unexpected happens, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association will definitely release public resources,” Qin Yu said.

“That’s right, but you have to be careful. If you try to use them, they won’t let you off easy.” The Pavilion Master also nodded.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Risks and opportunities coexist. I have to do this. Otherwise... I don’t know when I will be able to save Ruoxue.”

The Pavilion Master could only comfort him, “I will try my best to find someone to make Yan Ruoxue’s life in prison more comfortable.”

Qin Yu nodded. At this time, he suddenly thought of something and said, “Right, how is Yan Jiang?”

The Pavilion Master said in a deep voice, “He is unconscious, but his life isn’t in danger.”

Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief. He cupped his hands and said, “Pavilion Master, when he wakes up, please thank him on my behalf.”

The Pavilion Master nodded slightly and didn’t say anything more.

On the other side, after Qu Xie got in the car, his expression instantly turned cold.

“F * ck!” Qu Xie rarely swore!

“I never thought that I would be defeated by Qin Yu today. Motherf * cker!”

Xia Hang also sighed and asked, “President Qu, if this matter is reported to the higher-ups, the higher-ups would handle it, right?”

Qu Xie glanced at Xia Hang and snorted. “Handle it my *ss! Mr. Zhou represents the government. Do they dare to go against the government?”

Xia Hang could only comfort him. “Don’t worry, Mr. Yan will definitely kill Qin Yu as soon as possible.”

“Kill my *ss!” Qu Xie said with some displeasure.

“Call him immediately and bring Yan Guiyi back.”

Xia Hang was stunned and said, “Why? Mr. Yan should succeed very soon...”

Qu Xie said coldly, “Idiot! If we kill Qin Yu Now, what will Mr. Zhou think? Do you want the Jingdu Martial Arts Association to oppose the government?!”

Xia Hang suddenly understood. He frowned and said, “Are we going to let Qin Yu go just like that?”

“Let him go?” Qu Xie sneered. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Doesn’t Qin Yu want resources? I’ll give them to him!”

“As long as he dares to go, no one can say anything about it if he gets killed.”

Xia Hang immediately understood after hearing that.

“President Qu, I’ll make the arrangements right away! The Jingdu Martial Arts Association has countless resources. We’ll just pick any one of them and give it to them,” Xia Hang said with a smile.

Qu Xie exhorted, “Remember, don’t just put on an act. You must satisfy Mr. Zhou.”

“I understand. Please rest assured.” Xia Hang nodded slightly.

...

On the other side, after Qin Yu and the Pavilion Master parted ways, he went straight back to Chuzhou.

When Qin Yu arrived home, the man with the mustache and Yao Qing were roasting mutton to eat.

The two of them looked very happy, and there was a pile of beer bottles beside them.

After seeing Qin Yu, Yao Qing hurriedly stood up and said, “Mr. Qin, you’re back. Come and have some!”

Qin Yu glanced at Yao Qing and said, “Your dantian was destroyed, yet you have the mood to roast meat?”

Yao Qing said with a smile, “What’s there to worry about? You will help me anyway, right?”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but be speechless. Yao Qing was really happy-go-lucky.

“Where’s Taozi?” Qin Yu swept a glance, but didn’t find Taozi’figure.

Yao Qing sighed and said, “Taozi’s face has been disfigured. She’s been in a bad mood these few days. You’d better think of a way.”

Qin Yu also felt a little guilty. If it weren’t for him, Taozi wouldn’t have suffered this.

Fortunately, repairing one’s face wasn’t a difficult thing for Qin Yu.

“What did you want to talk to me about?” Qin Yu asked.

With a wave of his hand, a prescription landed in front of Qin Yu.

“Look, this is the prescription to save Fang Yue,” said the man with the mustache.

Qin Yu took the prescription and glanced at it. A trace of surprise flashed in his eyes.

This man with the mustache was really quite impressive. He could even get such a prescription.

“Thank you.” Qin Yu nodded slightly.

At this point, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

He looked at the man with the mustache and said seriously, “When are you going to dig a grave?”

The man with the mustache’s expression darkened and he rolled his eyes. “What do you mean by digging a grave? That’s called archaeology and historical research!”

“Okay, when are you going to do archaeology?” Qin Yu said helplessly.

The man with the mustache mumbled, “Not necessarily. Maybe in the next two days.”

“When you do archaeology in the future... I’ll go with you,” Qin Yu said.

The man with the mustache threw the mutton away in his hand and said with a smile, “Really? That’s nice. I need a helper!”

“Really.” Qin Yu nodded.

Now, Qin Yu had to seize every opportunity that he could. Maybe he could get lucky through the man with the mustache.

“Okay, then I’ll tell you when I set off,” the man with the mustache said excitedly.

Qin Yu naturally couldn’t leave these few days, because he knew the Jingdu Martial Arts Association would definitely make a move.

Sure enough, three days later, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association publicly released a message on the forum:

For the development of the martial arts world, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association would make its private resources public.

Next monday, we will select ten martial artists from the rankings to participate in our training.

Seeing this news, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

The Jingdu Martial Arts Association was really shameless. They were obviously forced to do so, but they made themselves sound so noble.

Then, a power ranking list was released.

This list was also the latest and most authoritative power ranking list.
