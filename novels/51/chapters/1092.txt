Chapter 1093: Chapter 1,093, smashed into minced meat! 

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “It seems that your information is very limited. I killed Gu Zizhen. Is there a problem with me taking his place?”

“You killed Gu Zizhen?”A trace of surprise flashed through the Elder’s eyes, and then his gaze fell on Zhai Xing.

“Zhai Xing, it’s one thing for you to betray Gu Zizhen, but you even joined hands to kill your master? What benefits did this brat give you?”

Qin Yu’s expression became increasingly gloomy, and a faint killing intent emanated from his body.

“Why? Do You Want to kill me?”The grand elder laughed coldly.

“You dare to attack me as an early-stage martial saint? Or are you planning to join forces with Zhai Xing just like how you killed Gu Zizhen?”

“F * ck your mother!”

Before Qin Yu could make a move, a burly figure suddenly flashed over!

He was extremely tall and his body was emitting a scarlet red light. He suddenly punched the Grand Elder’s face!

This punch sent the grand elder flying for hundreds of meters and his body slammed into the wall.

Not only that, his jaw was almost shattered and blood was dripping down.

“Old Thing, I’ve been listening to you for a long time. Don’t you believe that I’ll break your mouth!”Chang Mang pointed at the Grand Elder and cursed.

The Grand Elder was furious. He glared at Chang Mang and said coldly, “Little Bastard, you don’t know your place. Today, I’ll teach you a good lesson on behalf of Your Parents!”

“Teach me a lesson? Are You F * cking worthy?”Chang Mang took a step forward with full force, shaking the entire ground with a rumble!

Qin Yu patted Chang Mang’s shoulder and said, “Leave it to me.”

Chang Mang glanced at Qin Yu and said, “Alright, hit him hard on the mouth!”

Qin Yu looked at the grand elder coldly and said, “When Gu Zizhen was here, you only dared to hide from the world. Now that he’s dead, you all came out one by one. Why? Do you think I’m easy to bully?”

The grand elder said sinisterly, “Cut the crap. He doesn’t dare to replace Gu Zizhen. I Dare!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Then, the Grand Elder raised both of his hands, and a bright ray of light condensed on his hands.

Then, a huge blade that was shimmering with light condensed in the air.

“Today, I’ll let you taste the power of my origin Spirit Sacred Blade!”

The Grand Elder roared, and then both of his hands pressed down fiercely!

This grand elder was, after all, an advanced stage martial saint, so his strength was naturally not to be underestimated.

That huge blade tore through the sky and headed straight for Qin Yu’s glabella!

Qin Yu’s face turned cold, and his body emitted a golden glow.

In the next second, he suddenly raised his hand, and an incomparably huge golden palm rose from the ground. With a “PA”sound, it slapped towards that huge blade!

This palm directly smashed the origin spirit sacred blade into pieces!

The origin spirit sacred blade was like glass, as pieces of it fell down!

A trace of shock flashed across the face of the grand elder and he exclaimed, “How is this possible!”

Qin Yu looked at the grand elder coldly and said, “With this little bit of ability, you dare to boast shamelessly? You are weak and don’t know yourself. You still want to take advantage of your seniority? You better go to Hell!”

Before the grand elder could react, that huge golden palm had already slapped towards him!

The golden light illuminated the heaven and earth, and the palm brought with it rolling divine might as it crushed down!

“Boom!”

This slap directly smashed the Grand Elder’s body and primordial spirit into meat paste!

The surrounding people were dumbstruck, and couldn’t help but take a step back.

“This kid is so strong!”This was practically the same thought that they all had!

At the same time, they felt waves of lingering fear in their hearts.

Fortunately, they were not the ones who had attacked. Otherwise, the one who had been slapped to death would not be the doyen monster.

Qin Yu coldly swept his gaze across the crowd and said, “Anyone else who wants to attack, feel free to do so.”

Everyone looked at each other. Then, someone laughed and said, “Little friend Qin, you must be joking. You have offered such top-notch resources. Why would we attack you? We are more than grateful.”

Qin Yu snorted coldly and ignored them.

“Damn, that is an advanced stage martial saint. Did you kill him with one slap?”Chang Mang could not help but come forward and said.

Qin Yu laughed and said, “Although that doyen is an advanced stage martial saint, he has been in seclusion for many years. His strength can not be displayed much.”

“If he is like Zhai Xing, I am afraid I will have to use some strength.”

“TSK TSK, be modest.”Chang Mang rolled his eyes.

Qin Yu smiled and didn’t explain further.

After killing the doyen monster, everyone seemed to have quieted down.

Qin Yu, pavilion master, and Jiang gathered with them and took out the map.

The map recorded the Cloud Dragon Island.

“I seem to have heard of the Cloud Dragon Island.”At this moment, pavilion master suddenly said.

Qin Yu was slightly surprised as he said, “You’ve heard of the Cloud Dragon Island?”

“Yes.”The pavilion master nodded slightly.

“It’s said that many years ago, a martial saint once set foot on the island and never came out again.”

“Yes, there is indeed such a legend.”Zhai Xing also nodded and said.

“None of the martial saints who went in came out alive.”

Qin Yu could not help but frown slightly.

It seemed that this cloud dragon island was not simple.

However, this also meant that there must be some shocking treasure on the Cloud Dragon Island. Otherwise, they would not have let so many martial saints risk their lives to go there.

“Let’s take a risk.”Qin Yu said.

After he had finished speaking, Qin Yu turned around and walked to the front of the discussion martial hall. He told everyone about this matter.

“This time, it will definitely be filled with danger. If anyone is afraid, it’s still not too late to withdraw now.”Qin Yu said.

Everyone could not help but start discussing in low voices.

“Many martial saints actually died on that island?”

“It’s not that many martial saints died. It’s just that none of the martial saints can leave Alive!”

“Forget it. Since we’re here, let’s take a risk!”

There were also people who shook their heads and said, “It’s not easy for me to wait until the Holy Region Opens. I don’t want any accidents to happen at this time.”

Soon, four or five old men left the scene.
