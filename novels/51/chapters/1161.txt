Chapter 1162: Chapter 1,162, absorption of blood! 

Zhai Xing frowned slightly and said, “Then this convention... is it still going to be held?”

“Hold my A * s!”Gu Xinghe roared angrily.

“The main character is no longer around, yet there’s still a BULLSH * T convention! Go and find Qin Yu for me!”

Su Qi sneered, “Some people are destined to become the main characters of the era. No matter how despicable your methods are, it’s useless. No one can stop their growth.”

This sentence was not only meant for Gu Xinghe, but also seemed to be a summary of himself.

At this moment, Su Qi deeply understood this logic.

Gu Xinghe glanced at Su Qi coldly. Right now, he did not have the mood to care about Su Qi. The most important thing was to find Qin Yu as soon as possible.

Just as Gu Xinghe was about to leave, he suddenly stopped in his tracks.

He turned to look at Su qi and asked, “Do you want to live?”

Su Qi was stunned.

Su Qi, who had already given up hope, now had a glimmer of hope in her eyes!

“Of course I do,”Su Qi said hurriedly.

Gu Xinghe sneered, “I do need to know about your higher-ups right now. You’re quite lucky. As long as you listen to me obediently, I promise to spare your life.”

Su Qi, who was full of sarcasm a moment ago, suddenly changed into a completely different person after hearing those words.

She hurriedly walked up to Gu Xinghe, bowed, and said, “I’ll listen to you.”

...

On the other side, Qin Yu was sitting in the living room.

Although the entire mystic realm was not big, it had all the internal organs. The furniture inside was all made of expensive and solid wood.

Qin Yu held the jar and then looked at Yan Yongfu.

“Don’t tell me you don’t know how to use it?”Yan Yongfu seemed to have noticed Qin Yu’s embarrassment.

Qin Yu grabbed the jar and guessed, “Drink it?”

“... of course not.”Yan Yongfu shook his head.

He stretched out his finger and reached for the jar, but it was opened by Qin Yu.

“Take your dirty hand away,”Qin Yu said with a cold face.

Yan Yongfu withdrew his hand resentfully and then said with an embarrassed smile, “It’s actually very simple. Just use your cultivation method to absorb the blood.”

“Cultivation method?”Qin Yu frowned slightly.

“That’s right. Open the pores all over your body and slowly absorb the blood.”Yan Yongfu stroked his beard and said indifferently.

Qin Yu lowered his head to look at the blood and couldn’t help but fall into silence.

After thinking for a moment, he said, “How long will it take?”

“Look at the state of compatibility. The more perfect the state of compatibility is, the longer it will take,”Yan Yongfu said.

“The best fit we know so far is Yan Jinyao. He spent a few hours.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh when he heard that. “Is that considered a fit? He’s just wasting a god’s gift.”

Qin Yu remembered the last battle with Yan Jinyao very clearly.

The strength he unleashed was not worthy of his name.

“We don’t need to waste any more time. Gu Xinghe will be furious when he finds out that we have left. Innocent people will definitely be implicated,”Qin Yu said.

“Prepare a place for me. I’ll start absorbing the blood now.”

“Okay.”Yan Yongfu was also a little excited.

Now that they could no longer get rid of Qin Yu, he wanted to see what would happen when Qin Yu fused with the blood.

Then, Yan Yongfu brought Qin Yu to the bathroom.

There was a huge bathtub in the bathroom, and Qin Yu relied on the bathtub to absorb the blood. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Yan Yongfu stretched out a ray of light from his palm and covered the bathtub, cleaning up all the miscellaneous things on the bathtub.

“It’s done.”Then, Yan Yongfu pointed at the jar of blood and signaled Qin Yu to pour it into the bathtub.

Qin Yu poured the blood into the bathtub according to Yan Yongfu’s request.

Looking at the fresh red blood in the bathtub, Qin Yu’s heart felt like it was being pricked by Needles.

So much fresh blood, was it drawn from a person’s body? How much pain would he have to suffer?

“The ending is greater than the process,”Yan Yongfu reminded from the side.

Qin Yu glanced at him and did not say anything more. He passed through his body and entered the bathtub.

The moment his body entered the bathtub, the blood began to throb violently, as if it was boiling!

All the blood seemed to have gained its own consciousness and kept sticking to Qin Yu’s body!

This strange scene could not help but make Yan Yongfu’s eyes widen!

“Is this the true compatibility?”Yan Yongfu muttered in a low voice.

This was the first time he had seen such a strange scene!

The blood seemed to be giving Qin Yu a hug. There was no need to deliberately absorb it. It stuck tightly to Qin Yu’s body.

The blood passed through the pores and kept drilling into Qin Yu’s body.

Qin Yu followed Yan Yongfu’s request and closed his eyes slightly to start absorbing the blood.

The pores all over his body opened, and the blood flowed into his body through his pores.

In an instant, a strange warm current spread throughout Qin Yu’s entire body.

This feeling was very strange, as if he was soaking in a hot spring. It was more like the feeling he had when he first came into contact with spiritual qi.

The blood flowed through Qin Yu’s body, and at this moment, Qin Yu’s entire body seemed to be changing.

His physical body began to undergo drastic changes. It was more of an evolution than a change!

His body was covered in a layer of extremely holy light. His body, which had been hard to begin with, was now even more indestructible!

The sound of his bones cracking could be heard. This kind of change was somewhat similar to the effect of the nine transformation golden pill. However, compared to the nine transformation golden pill, it was many times stronger!

Not only that, this kind of change did not cause any pain at all. On the contrary, his body was extremely comfortable!

Looking at Qin Yu, whose entire body was bursting with divine light, Yan Yongfu’s eyes could not help but shine brightly.

“This is too unbelievable! It seems that our speculation is correct! Once the two of you combine, it will indeed bring about an extremely strange transformation!”Yan Yongfu could not be more excited!

He even felt that being able to witness this scene with his own eyes was a great honor!
