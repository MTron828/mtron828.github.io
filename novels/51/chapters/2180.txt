2181 The Terrifying Heavenly Tribulation

The fourth heavenly tribulation was brewing in the sky but refused to descend for a long while.

Qin Yu understood deep down that the fourth heavenly tribulation was only the real beginning.

All the demons disappeared, and the sky turned into a terrifying and ferocious face.

The face opened its bloody mouth, and it was a bottomless darkness looking toward the mouth.

That terrifying and ferocious face in the sky gradually revealed, making people feel a chill.

This face, distorted and without the slightest human characteristics, seemed to be formed by darkness and malice. Its skin was like charred charcoal, dark and rough and full of cracks and scars, emanating a suffocating stench.

The eyes were the most terrifying part. They were as deep as two abysses without life but only endless darkness and cruelty.

The mouth on the face was wide open as if it could swallow the entire world. Its teeth were like sharp blades, each emitting a cold light, flickering with the desire to devour everything. A foul internal qi emanated from the depths of the mouth, making people feel nauseous.

The dark internal qi emanating from this face filled the sky, making people feel suffocated and desperate. It symbolized evil and destruction as if it could devour everything.

As the face appeared, the mouth gradually opened, revealing a boundless dark abyss full of various terrifying scenes and creatures which roared in the darkness, trying to rush out and leap into the sky.

A dark internal qi gushed out from the mouth like an invisible force that made one’s heart tremble. It spread and covered the entire sky, devouring the light.

Qin Yu’s body trembled as he felt the pressure of this darkness, but he did not back down, knowing it was the challenge he had to face and the enemy he had to defeat.

Qin Yu took a deep breath, and his eyes shone with determination. He adjusted his internal qi and gathered his true essence, allowing the strength of his body to reach its limit.

The golden light was released from his body, forming an indestructible shield. The shield emitted a dazzling light, shining with the light of hope in the face of darkness.

Qin Yu waved his palm, and Ten Thousand Spell Breaking Punch appeared in his hand. Golden light burst out, but soon it was swallowed by the darkness of the void.

He looked up, gazing at the ferocious face, and a sense of solemness welled up in his heart.

That ferocious face continued to erupt with tremendously terrifying flames. Traces of the power of the dao technique were continuously brewing.

It was the true dao technique of heaven and earth. It could even reappear in the void.

“Boom!”

In the next moment, a boom sounded, and the void around Qin Yu began to transform!

The pitch-black void disappeared and was replaced by a vast and boundless world!

In this world, the dao technique and the way that had disappeared reappeared and trapped Qin Yu!

Looking up, the ferocious face did not disappear. Instead, it had become even more terrifying!

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold as he said coldly, “You’ve finally realized the problem.”

The previous three heavenly tribulations had been easygoing because there was no dao technique in the void!

Without the dao technique, the power of the heavenly tribulation was not as strong as usual, thus unable to do anything to Qin Yu!

“I didn’t expect you to be able to conjure a new world and pull me into the rules of the dao technique,” Qin Yu said coldly.

At this moment, Qin Yu was somewhat confused.

Was the depths of the void part of the dao technique? Could it be that the void was an existence independent of the dao technique?

All things began from chaos, and was the void filled with pure chaos qi part of the dao technique or the beginning of all things?

Qin Yu could not figure it out and did not continue dwelling on it.

The most important thing now was to pass the fourth heavenly tribulation.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and adjusted his internal qi to its peak state, and a golden light suddenly appeared, intending to illuminate the entire sky!

And the heavenly tribulation, which had regained the power of the dao technique, instantly became even more terrifying!

From that bloody mouth, tumbling heavenly lightning emanated and shook the surroundings!

This heavenly lightning had nurtured a dao technique that could destroy everything!

Wu Ji’s divine robe on Qin Yu also emitted light at this moment, almost fused with Qin Yu’s physical body, and resisted the fourth heavenly tribulation together!

“Boom!”

Finally, the heavenly tribulation brewing for a long time descended from the sky!

A heavenly lightning that looked like an icy-blue dragon spewed out from its bloody mouth!

“Rumble!”

A massive heavenly lightning shot out like an icy blue dragon, bringing destructive internal qi as it bombarded Qin Yu.

Qin Yu looked grave. He was well aware of the terrifying might of this fourth heavenly tribulation, and he immediately mobilized all the true essence in his body, and golden light erupted, forming an indestructible shield that blocked the impact of the heavenly lightning.

However, the enormous heavenly lightning was like a flood of endless power, striking Qin Yu’s shield and forcing him to step back.

Qin Yu’s expression changed as he felt the pressure of the heavenly lightning. His body began to tremble, but he did not give up, knowing that only by defeating this fourth heavenly tribulation could he continue moving forward.

He took a deep breath, gathered his true essence, and adjusted his state again. His eyes flickered with unwavering determination as he regained his stance.

“Ten Thousand Spell Breaking Punch!” Qin Yu roared and raised his hand to unleash the punch!

His fist instantly turned white-hot, containing Qin Yu’s invincible battle intent and undefeatable dao mind as he faced the fourth heavenly tribulation head-on!

The golden radiance and the blue heavenly lightning collided at this moment. The two radiances continuously rubbed and collided, forming a strange scene in the sky!

“Crackle…”

The fourth heavenly tribulation was extremely powerful as if it wanted to completely tear Qin Yu’s physical body apart!

The golden light on his body gradually dimmed, and an incredibly terrifying power surged from that bloody mouth and smashed down fiercely!

Finally, at this moment, the Golden Light on Qin Yu’s body disappeared, and his body was ruthlessly smashed into the ground! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

In an instant, the fourth heavenly tribulation turned into a gigantic hand that pressed down on Qin Yu as if it wanted to completely shatter him!

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. Without even thinking about it, he immediately activated the cosmic form!

At this moment, Qin Yu’s physical body became incomparably enormous. His two massive hands were covered in golden light as he fiercely face the palm formed by the heavenly tribulation!

“Clang!”

At this moment, an intense collision occurred, and a terrifying internal qi rippled in all directions like water ripples!

Everything in the surroundings was instantly destroyed. The void shattered, the earth trembled, and the way of the dao technique continuously collapsed and reformed!

Numerous cracks appeared in the sky as if the entire world was trembling. The tumbling dark energy and the golden light intertwined, forming a gorgeous and terrifying scene!
