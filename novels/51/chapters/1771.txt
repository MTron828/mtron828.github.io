1772 Go to Thunder Courtyard With Jue Wu

Qin Yu didn’t want to figure out what kind of sect Satan was at this moment.

Only by taking every step well could he have a future.

Sister Ning didn’t stay any longer and quickly left the place.

Xiaoqian and Wanru, who were not far away, quickly walked over.

The two of them looked at Qin Yu, who was deep in thought, and didn’t know what to say.

Xiaoqian suddenly asked, “What? Are you regretting it now?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No, I’m not. There is no need to. Everything has to be weighed. I can’t guarantee that the decision I made today was right. But for now, it is indeed right.”

Xiaoqian said with a chuckle, “Well, that’s good. Don’t forget your promise to me.”

“Yeah, of course.” Qin Yu nodded.

After that, Qin Yu left the place and returned to Dayue mountain.

As for how to devour other people’s primordial spirits, Qin Yu had no idea.

In the past few days, Qin Yu had been extremely confused and at a loss.

Jue Wu once again started closed-door cultivation. Her method of closed-door cultivation was extremely unique. She ate and drank as much as she could while waiting for her cultivation to increase.

As for Wen Wanchong, although he wanted to keep Qin Yu company, he could not help him much now.

After much thought, Qin Yu finally decided to make a trip to Tianyun Sect.

On the Cultivation Mountain, Qin Yu stood behind Xiao Sheng and said half-jokingly, “Do you want to guess why I’m here?”

With his back to Qin Yu, Xiao Sheng said in a deep voice, “It must be related to your primordial spirit.”

“Yes.” Qin Yu didn’t try to hide anything.

He immediately told Xiao Sheng about his recent experiences, including the thing about Satan.

“Have you heard of the organization, Satan?” Qin Yu asked.

Xiao Sheng shook his head. He had no idea.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

If even Xiao Sheng didn’t know about it, it must be an extremely mysterious and terrifying organization.

Xiao Sheng then asked, “You don’t know how to make your decision now, do you?”

Qin Yu sighed and said, “You are right. Devouring other people’s primordial spirits puts a lot of psychological pressure on me.”

Xiao Sheng also sighed. “Well, well, well. People like you always like to use morality to condemn yourselves. Do you really have to do that? ”

“You’re doing this to yourself, and so is Xiao Hai. No one in this world is perfect, so why do you have to satisfy everyone?”

Qin Yu did not say anything. As a modern person, he knew that it was wrong.

However, Qin Yu would never kill the innocent.

At this moment, Xiao Sheng suddenly said, “Go to Thunder Courtyard.”

Qin Yu was stunned. He had long heard of Thunder Courtyard.

It was said that it was the most unique place in the entire Lizhou.

There were a lot of extremely strong people in that place. It seemed that all the talented young men had gone to Thunder Courtyard.

Qin Yu had always yearned to go to Thunder Courtyard, but she knew nothing about it.

Xiao Sheng said, “People from the East continent have been visiting Thunder Courtyard the most in recent years. It’s time for you to go there.”

Xiao Sheng seemed to have seen through Qin Yu’s confusion, and said with a faint smile, ” Thunder Courtyard is indeed mysterious, but it’s not as scary as you think. In the early days, they did take in many young people, but their requirements were very high. ”

Qin Yu asked in a deep voice, “How high were the requirements ?”

Xiao Sheng thought for a while and then said, “Yong Ji went to Thunder Courtyard before, but he was rejected.”

Qin Yu gasped when he heard that.

Even Yong Ji was rejected. He was one of the three lunatics and the three extremes. Although his character wasn’t very good, in terms of talent, he was definitely one of the best.

Xiao Sheng added, “Of course, nothing is absolute. They will also send out invitations. For example, Xiao Hai and I have been invited before.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but smile bitterly. As expected, as long as one had the ability, the door was open to him.

Xiao Sheng said, “It’s no exaggeration to say that Thunder Courtyard is the best place you can go in Lizhou. It used to be the holy land that all cultivators in Lizhou wanted to go to.”

“And there’s one great benefit if you go to Thunder Courtyard.”

Qin Yu was stunned for a second and then asked, “What is it?”

Xiao Sheng said, “Thunder Courtyard has a special organization called Devil Hunter. Their cultivation method is very simple, which is to kill evil people.”

“It must be much easier for you to kill those evil people, right?”

Xiao Sheng’s words intrigued Qin Yu a lot.

But soon, Qin Yu shook his head.

He said with a bitter smile, “In my current state, I’m afraid Thunder Courtyard won’t take me in.”

Xiao Sheng said, “They will. With your reputation in Nanzhou, Thunder Courtyard will definitely accept you. However, with your current state, it will be difficult for you to become a Devil Hunter.”

Qin Yu sighed.

If Qin Yu were at his peak, it would be easy for him to become a Devil Hunter.

But in his current state, it was difficult for him to even mobilize his spiritual power, so how could he fight with others?

“I have a good relationship with the director of Thunder Courtyard. If you want to go there, I can help you. What do you say?” Xiao Sheng suddenly said.

Qin Yu thought for a moment, then finally nodded and said, “Alright.”

Xiao Sheng nodded and said, “Then prepare yourself. We’ll set off in three days.”

“Many thanks.” Qin Yu bowed slightly to Xiao Sheng.

The Thunder Courtyard indeed had the best cultivation resources in the entire Lizhou. If Qin Yu wanted to reach the Reversion Void Stage as soon as possible, that place was the best choice. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

According to Xiaoqian and Sister Ning, the more primordial spirits he devoured, the faster he would recover.

As long as Qin Yu devoured enough primordial spirits, he would soon be able to recover to his peak state.

Of course, Qin Yu did not plan to stay in Thunder Courtyard for too long. That kind of academic cultivation was not suitable for him.

After returning to Dayue mountain, Qin Yu told the others about this.

When they learned that Qin Yu was going to Thunder Courtyard, Wen Wanchong and the others were quite supportive.

Only Jue Wu, who was eating and drinking, ran over quickly.

She frowned and asked, “What if you get bullied in Thunder Courtyard in your current state?”

Qin Yu said with a bitter smile, “Being bullied? Who can bully me?”

Jue Wu shook her head repeatedly. “You don’t know about this place. Thunder Courtyard is a place where all the chosen ones in Lizhou gather. In this kind of place, strength is the most important. With your current condition, you will inevitably be discriminated against.”

Jue Wu’s words were reasonable, but Qin Yu didn’t seem to have any other choice.

He couldn’t just kill people on the streets, as that wouldn’t help him improve much.

At this time, Jue Wu suddenly said, “Well, I’ll go with you. What do you say?”

Jue Wu raised her small fist and said, “With me protecting you, I guarantee that no one will dare to bully you.”

Qin Yu wanted to say something. But Wen Wanchong nodded and said before Qin Yu could say anything, “Lord Jue Wu is right. With her around you, we will be less worried about you.”
