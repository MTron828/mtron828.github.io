Chapter 845: Chapter 845: Suppressed Internal Qi!

The martial saint’s internal Qi was extremely powerful. It was not something Qin Yu could contend against!

However, Qin Yu could not just sit there and wait for his death when he faced the martial saint who was approaching him.

“Internal Qi!”He roared furiously and the internal Qi in his entire body exploded to the extreme. Then, he punched out fiercely and met the attack head-on!

“Boom!”

The scene instantly collapsed as Qin Yu’s physical body was sent flying!

A mouthful of blood flowed out from his mouth, and his body revealed his sparkling white bones!

Qin Yu flipped over and jumped up from the ground.

He looked at the wounds on his body and could not help but frown as he said, “As expected of a martial saint, he’s actually so powerful...”

Qin Yu was not the only one who was shocked. The two martial saints not far away and Wan Gu Qiong also widened their eyes.

“He didn’t die?”The old man who had attacked could not help but widen his eyes.

Wan Gu Qiong said in a deep voice, “Did you see it? This kid is not simple. He took a strike from a martial saint at the level of a martial marquis. This is definitely not something an ordinary martial marquis can do.”

That old man also nodded slightly and said, “That’s right. From the looks of it, he does have to die.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Qin Yu looked at these two martial saints coldly and the worry in his heart grew stronger.

He raised his head and glanced at the light hovering in mid-air. He could not help but frown slightly.

The light seemed to be emitting waves of icy cold qi.

This internal Qi was spreading extremely quickly and almost instantly covered the entire area.

Not only that, that cold internal Qi was also spreading rapidly to the surrounding area.

“Yin qi?”Qin Yu quickly made a judgment!

Perhaps, this yin qi was the one that was sealed on the circular plate!

All the yin qi gathered at that point, but now it was spreading rapidly.

“Yin Heart?”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice and suddenly thought of a noun.

He had seen this noun when he was watching the history of the masked woman’s martial arts in the Scripture Pavilion.

It was said that when all the Yin Qi was gathered at one point and condensed to the extreme, it would form a yin heart.

The Yin Qi contained in the Yin Heart was extremely pure. It was the yin qi that was gathered from the battlefield!

“If it really is the yin heart, I might still be saved today.”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

“What are you mumbling about?”In front, the martial saint said coldly.

“Qin Yu, can you withstand the first punch and the second?”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly and said with a cold smile, “How would I know if I don’t try?”

“Hahaha!”This martial saint immediately burst into laughter.

“I admit that you are somewhat extraordinary, but it’s not a good thing to be overly confident!”

Before he had finished speaking, that martial saint charged towards Qin Yu once again!

He held onto the radiance in his hand and ruthlessly smashed it towards Qin Yu from above!

Qin Yu did not dare to be negligent. He roared furiously and clenched his fist to meet it head on!

“Boom!”

At the instant of the collision, Qin Yu was sent flying once again!

His bones had shattered once again. However, to everyone’s surprise, Qin Yu was still not dead. Even his internal Qi had not weakened!

“How could this be?”The few people present frowned.

The martial saint who had attacked looked at his own fist with suspicion.

“That’s strange. Even if this kid’s body is strong, it’s impossible for him to take two of my punches.”The martial saint muttered in a low voice.

Qin Yu shouted, “I’m not dead yet, come again!”

That martial saint seemed to have been angered by Qin Yu’s attitude.

His expression was gloomy as he said with a cold tone, “You’re courting death!”

That martial saint took another step forward and raised his hand to throw another punch!

With this punch, Qin Yu was forced back eight steps!

This undoubtedly infuriated that martial saint even more!

He did not say a word as he threw another punch!

This time, Qin Yu took six steps back!

For the third punch, Qin Yu took four steps back.

For the fourth punch, Qin Yu only took two steps back!

“Hahahaha!”This could not help but make Qin Yu burst out laughing.

“Old Thing, it seems that you are only so-so. If you want to kill me today, I’m afraid you won’t have the chance!”Qin Yu laughed loudly.

Meanwhile, the martial saint’s expression had already turned extremely ugly. A layer of secret sweat appeared on his forehead as if he was extremely anxious.

“How could his physical body be so tyrannical?”Wan Gu Qiong gritted his teeth and said with some unwillingness.

“That’s not right.”That martial saint shook his head.

“This has nothing to do with his physical body. It’s my strength... that is continuously being reduced!”

After his reminder, the other martial saint seemed to have sensed it as well.

He tried to move the Qi flowing through his meridians, but he discovered that the internal Qi seemed to have been frozen and was flowing at an extremely slow speed.

Moreover, this speed was continuously decreasing as if it was going to freeze completely at any moment!

“As expected!”Wan Gu Qiong also noticed the abnormality!

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “The heavens are really helping me. I’m afraid it won’t be that easy for you to kill me today.”

These two martial saints ignored Qin Yu. They quickly raised their heads and looked at the Yin Xin that was suspended in the air.

“Could it be because of that thing?”One of the Martial Saints asked.

“Yin qi, this secret realm is filled with yin qi!”The other martial saint said hurriedly.

What they cultivated was all qi/spiritual energy, which was contrary to yin qi.

Now that the entire secret realm was covered with yin qi, this also caused their internal Qi to be completely suppressed!

“If I’m not wrong, the internal Qi in your bodies is completely useless now.”At this moment, Qin Yu who was not far away said lightly.

Just as Qin Yu had said, these two martial saints tried to use their internal Qi and realized that they had been completely suppressed.

“In this case... you can only rely on your physical bodies, right?”Qin Yu grinned and revealed a mouthful of white teeth.

If it was just his physical body, Qin Yu was not afraid of a martial saint at all!

Qin Yu’s body was not inferior to a martial saint’s at all!

Not only that, Qin Yu could still use his internal Qi!

Although his internal Qi was also somewhat suppressed, it was not as serious as theirs!

“Now, it’s my turn, right?”Qin Yu squinted his eyes and said.

“Kid, don’t be arrogant for too long. So what if you can only rely on your physical body? We are at the martial saint stage. We are definitely not someone a martial marquis like you can compare to!”One of the martial saints shouted.

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and sneered, “Is that so? Then you guys can come and try.”

“Arrogant!”One of the martial saints shouted. He used his fierce physical body to clench his fist and rushed towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu was not afraid at all. Golden Light rose from his body and his fist contained an undefeatable power. He raised his hand to meet the incoming attack!
