Chapter 589: I Think You’re Blind! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Not far away, a few people were gathered together.

One of the youths had a sunken chest and blood was flowing out of his mouth.

He sat on the ground and his body was retreating timidly.

“What, is this a genius from the bottom class?” A tall man said coldly.

This person’s name was Ling Guan, and he was ranked sixth on the martial arts rankings!

His entire body was filled with aggression, and he had a condescending attitude.

When the surrounding people saw this scene, no one dared to approach.

Ling Guan continued to walk toward the youth. He raised his large hand and grabbed the neck of the youth who was vomiting blood before lifting him up into the air.

“Tell me, is this the ability of the bottom class? Ants are indeed ants!” Ling Guan roared, and he exerted force with his hand to throw the youth out!

The young man spat out a mouthful of blood, and two bloody marks appeared on his neck.

Seeing this, Qin Yu didn’t say anything and just watched quietly.

Ling Guan didn’t stop. He strode toward the young man and stepped on the young man’s chest.

“A bunch of ants are actually trying to covet natural treasures,” Ling Guan said coldly.

The young man struggled with all his might. Because he used too much strength, blood started to flow from his seven orifices.

Everyone looked on coldly. Even the bottom-class martial artists just watched silently.

Not far away, Yan Guiyi saw this scene and couldn’t help but smirk.

“Two people of different classes will clash sooner or later, but I didn’t expect it to happen so quickly.” Yan Guiyi crossed his arms and sneered.

Qin Yu naturally understood this logic, but he had no intention of making a move.

The biggest weakness of these ordinary cultivators was that they would never band together.

They would never interfere unless it happened to them.

“Why don’t you just hide in your small city? Why do you have to get involved in this?” Ling Guan’s force intensified, as if he would trample the young man to death at any moment.

“Tell me!” Ling Guan shouted loudly.

“F * ck you!”

At this moment, a figure suddenly shot out!

He activated the scarlet light in his hand and headed straight for Ling Guan!

The terrifying force caused even Ling Guan’s expression to change!

“Bang!”

The huge collision stirred up waves a hundred thousand feet high on the sea surface!

The two fists collided, and the two were at a stalemate!

“What bottom class? What upper class? You guys are the ones. I, Chang Mang, am unwilling to accept it!” A tall young man shouted loudly.

Ling Guan narrowed his eyes and sneered. “What, you want to stand up for him? I think you’re courting death!”

Ling Guan let out a shout and his body suddenly shot out towards Chang Mang!

Chang Mang wasn’t afraid at all. His body was surging with aggression and burning with a red light!

Chang Mang let out an angry roar and his fierce fist collided with Ling Guan!

“Bang!”

Something shocking happened. Ling Guan actually took a few steps back, and the bones in his hand were almost broken!

“As an member of an aristocratic family, you are only so-so. I, Chang Mang, will kill you right now!”

Chang Mang’s killing intent surged, and his internal qi was burning to the extreme!

His red fist contained immense power as it ruthlessly smashed towards Ling Guan!

His speed was extremely fast!

Ling Guan’s expression changed. He hurriedly activated his spell and formed a barrier in front of him!

“Kacha!”

However, Chang Mang’s strength was beyond his imagination. He actually shattered this barrier, and then headed straight towards Ling Guan!

“Boom!”

This punch landed squarely on Ling Guan’s body!

In an instant, Ling Guan’s flesh was mangled and his bones shattered!

“I’ll kill you today!” Chang Mang went crazy. He didn’t have the slightest intention of stopping. Instead, he became even more aggressive!

His iron fists smashed towards Ling Guan’s head!

“Boom!”

Right at this moment, a black-gold light suddenly shot over from not far away and headed straight for Chang Mang’s side!

Chang Mang was sent flying!

Yan Guiyi was standing in front of Ling Guan and looking at Chang Mang coldly.

Chang Mang’s back was covered in blood from this blow, but he disregarded the pain as he climbed up from the ground again!

He glared at Yan Guiyi, and the murderous internal qi around his body grew stronger!

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel surprised.

Chang Mang’s body was actually so strong?

Yan Guiyi said coldly, “Attacking a companion is an unforgivable crime. This is a rule of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

As he spoke, a ball of black and gold light condensed on Yan Guiyi’s palm.

This light pointed at Chang Mang. He wanted to take his life!

“The bottom class is the bottom class. You will never understand what rules are!” Yan Guiyi shouted loudly, and the light in his hand immediately shot towards Chang Mang!

At this moment, a golden light blocked in front of Chang Mang!

The golden light collided with the black-golden light!

In an instant, the entire surface of the sea seemed to resonate with a loud bang!

The waves hit the rocks, and a crashing sound was heard.

Looking over, they saw Qin Yu standing in front of Chang Mang.

Although he wasn’t tall, he seemed powerful and mighty.

Yan Guiyi narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “Qin Yu? Do you want to meddle in other people’s business?”

“Meddle in other people’s business?” Qin Yu sneered.

“As the team leader, why did you attack Chang Mang?”

Yan Guiyi snorted and said, “He hurt people first. As the team leader, I naturally have to get rid of such an unstable person.”

“Hurt people first?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel like laughing.

“Why didn’t you take action when Ling Guan was bullying people just now? Why? Is it a capital crime for us bottom-class people to rebel? Only you guys can do it, but we can’t?”

Yan Guiyi’s expression changed, and he snorted lightly. “That’s because I didn’t see it just now.”

“Didn’t see it? I think you’re blind. Since your eyes are useless, why don’t you just take them out for you?” Qin Yu said coldly.

Yan Guiyi couldn’t help but smile. His internal qi rose slowly, and a strong killing intent swept across the whole place!

“Qin Yu, you slandered the captain. I have the right to punish you,” Yan Guiyi said with narrowed eyes.

Qin Yu’s body emitted a golden light. He sneered and said, “Can’t hold it in any longer?”

“Captain Yan, you’re too much of a bully!” At this time, another person stood up!

“Yes! We saw it clearly. It was clearly Ling Guan who bullied us first. If you want to punish someone, you have to punish Ling Guan first!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

In an instant, all the bottom-class martial artists started shouting.

This made Yan Guiyi’s expression become even colder. He snorted coldly and said, “What a bunch of unruly things! Fine, then I’ll teach you what etiquette is!”

As he spoke, Yan Guiyi closed his eyes and muttered something.
