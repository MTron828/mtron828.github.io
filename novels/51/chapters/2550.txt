Chapter 2551 Leaving

“The power of reversing life and death? So it’s actually this treasure.”

Saint Zi Yang’s body paused for a moment, but he was only slightly puzzled and continued to walk into the depths of the mist as if this supreme treasure of the ghost race did not pique his interest.

In the ghost realm, Ksitigarbha suddenly opened his eyes and let out a roar.

An enormous ghostly hand suddenly pierced through the void and grabbed toward the area of the Misty Forest.

At this moment, after the battle in the Misty Forest, the dark storm that permeated the area had disappeared completely.

The heavenly secrets here appeared in the entire world again at this point. In an instant, countless people noticed this change.

A Heavenly Sword fell from the sky and accurately smashed on the ghostly hand.

“Ksitigarbha, do you want to fight me to the death right now?”

Su Xinghe stood up, his gaze piercing through space and landing on Ksitigarbha. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

In the space between the two, countless storms appeared in the depths of the void.

Even the ground 100,000 meters away could clearly feel the terrifying tremors coming from afar.

After a long time, Ksitigarbha sat down again.

“The human race’s barrier is gone. I want to see how the human race will resist the next attack.”

“There is no need to worry…”

“Are you alright?”

Shen Xiao appeared beside Su Xinghe. Ksitigarbha was at the sixth level as Su Xinghe but his strength was above Su Xinghe. At this moment, she was also a little worried.

“It’s fine. Ksitigarbha, Immortal Crane, and others have suffered the backlash of the human race barrier. They should be heavily injured and won’t recover so quickly.”

Su Xinghe looked at the ghost realm and his expression revealed some hesitation.

“The human race has the barrier of the human race, and the other three realms probably have the same barrier. Moreover, there’s another sixth-level Saint in the monster realm now. His aura is monstrous. It’s too risky to go to the ghost realm now.”

Shen Xiao shook his head and stopped Su Xinghe from having the thought.

“Sigh!”

Su Xinghe shook his head and left, leaving behind a soft sigh.

“Qin Yu, are you alright?”

At this moment, the six people finally reacted and saw Qin Yu, who had turned into an old man.

Shen Qian’s eyes welled with tears. Everyone knew the price Qin Yu had to pay for the power of reversing life and death.

“I’m fine. Let’s think of a way to leave this place. These dark creatures are about to surround us.”

Qin Yu said with a bitter smile. The six of them had only recovered about half of their strength. This was all he could do.

He had a feeling that if he had more vital energy in his body, he could make them recover to their peak.

“It’s indeed a heaven-defying treasure of the ghost realm. No wonder Flower Granny told me not to use it.”

Qin Yu shook his head with a bitter smile. He was completely unable to move after that one attack.

“Stop talking and leave quickly!”

Xuan Xin roared. At this moment, he could also feel countless terrifying internal qi attacking in their direction.

The combined attack of the nine-winged demon army alone could have left them in a sorry state.

If they were surrounded at this moment, they would most probably die.

Xuan Xin held the Green Duckweed Sword and led the way.

Terrifying sword energy swept far and wide, and the dark creatures approaching them turned into minced meat.

Zhang Xiang and Li Yang also joined forces to activate their strongest talisman to protect everyone.

Meanwhile, Shen Qian and Shen Rou were controlling the treasure to relieve the pressure on the three of them.

Shen Qian supported Qin Yu. He could not even fly now.

“Where’s Senior Brother Xuan Tian? Senior Brother Xuan Tian seems not to follow us. He’s chasing after Martial Uncle Zi Yang!”

Li Yang shouted.

Xuan Tian at the back was like a deranged demon.

After the reversal of death, he once again chased after Zi Yang.

“This idiot!”

Xuan Xin rarely cursed, and he suddenly stopped.

“You guys continue to break through. I’ll go and bring him back.”

“Senior Brother, we will help you.”

Zhang Xiang and Li Yang also followed.

Shen Qian and Shen Rou seemed to be stunned as well. They stood rooted to the ground, not knowing what to do.

“My friend Qin Yu, we must go to help Senior Brother Xuan Xin. We can’t abandon him. Perhaps you break through on your own?”

Shen Rou said to Qin Yu like a retard.

“Quickly bring me along. I’ll die in my current state. How do I break through?”

Qin Yu said unhappily.

Once Xuan Xin left, even if the four of them broke through with all their might, it would be no different from sending their heads away.

“Oh.”

Shen Rou and Shen Qian then turned to follow Xuan Xin.

Xuan Tian had always pursued Saint Zi Yang’s Dao in the sect.

His faith revered Zi Yang, the ancestor of the sect, a sixth-level Daoist Saint who was now unexpectedly possessed by demonic forces.

This had shattered his dao mind completely. The Daoist ancestor he had been pursuing had fallen into the Path of Demon, so what was the point of continuing pursuing?

This had even involved the entire path of inheritance of the Three Purities Sect. Saint Zi Yang was considered one of the top few people in the Three Purities Sect. It would mean the entire Daoist system had entered the wrong path if he was possessed by demonic forces.

“Martial Uncle, things shouldn’t happen this way. What did you see?”

Xuan Tian muttered.

His body sped up again as he flew toward Saint Zi Yang.

However, moments before he could grasp the opportunity, his body suddenly ignited with dark flames. In the blink of an eye, his flesh was entirely reduced to ashes.

“Things shouldn’t happen this way! Tell me the truth! Martial Uncle Zi Yang!”

Xuan Tian’s soul burst out with intense light, and the soul pierced into Zi Yang’s body like an arrow that had left the bow.

His tablet suddenly shattered on the bodies of Xuan Xin and the other five.

Before the six entered the Misty Forest, they all had left their tablets behind so that they could detect the life state of each other if they lost contact.

At this moment, Xuan Xin was dead completely.

Xuan Xin suddenly stopped and stood on the spot in a daze.

It was as if he couldn’t believe that Xuan Tian would die just like that. The most elegant junior brother in the sect had died just like that.

A mark suddenly emitted an intense light. It was another kind of strong spiritual aura.

However, it was not an attack. When the gust of wind blew against his body, Qin Yu’s face could not help but reveal a trace of confusion.

His thoughts spun uncontrollably, and a sense of regret surged in his sea of consciousness.

From being a cuckold on Earth, he had walked step by step to where he was today.

How much suffering had he gone through, and how many friends had he lost?

Was it really worth it to get to where he was today?

Perhaps if he continued to pursue it like this, would there be even greater regrets? Would everything be worth it?

Various messy thoughts suddenly appeared in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness, probing deep within and questioning the core.

Suddenly, a green palm print entered Qin Yu’s forehead and pierced through his Sea of Soul.

“Slap!” Shen Rou’s palm slapped on Qin Yu’s forehead.
