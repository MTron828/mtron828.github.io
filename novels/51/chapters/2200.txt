2201 Without Mercy

The surroundings fell into complete silence. The onlookers, even the three aristocratic families, could not help but gasp.

The leader of the Skeleton Gang, a long-standing gang leader who had worked hard on the Black Platform Continent for thousands of years, was slapped into a pulp.

“This leader of the Skeleton Gang is a good-for-nothing. He was killed by a mere Early-stage True Saint.”

Lin Cheng shouted.

“Dad, hurry up and make a move. This guy nearly killed me!”

Lin Tong’s lips twitched as he suppressed his anger and said, “Even if you are from the Holy Region, you’re too arrogant, and don’t take our Black Platform Continent seriously!

“No matter what, the Skeleton Gang is still a sect of our Black Platform Continent. If you don’t sort out the matter, I’m afraid you won’t be able to leave this place!”

Yu Qingzi suddenly put away his fan.

“Noisy!”

Qin Yu glanced at them.

“Outrageous!”

Yu Qing Zi unfurled the feather fan in his hand, and the feather fan flew toward Qin Yu like a sharp flying knife. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

A crisp sound resembling the cry of a phoenix echoed throughout the entire space.

“The Phoenix Strike! It’s the ultimate technique of the head of the Yu family!”

Someone in the surroundings exclaimed.

The enormous feather fan flew through space at the speed of light and cut a few cultivators in the surroundings, who did not dodge in time, into countless pieces.

“It’s too late to beg for mercy now!”

Yu Qingzi sneered and said

“Saintly Body Technique.”

Qin Yu looked indifferent. The golden light on his fist suddenly soared.

The dazzling golden light seemed to have suppressed the sharp and piercing cry of the phoenix, and only an enormous golden fist was seen stretching out.

The feather fan turned into dust straight away, but the golden fist did not slow down at all.

In an instant, it crashed into Yu Qingzi’s chest.

“Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!”

The four defensive magical artifacts shattered straightaway, and Yu Qingzi’s body was sent flying tens of thousands of feet away. His fate remained unknown.

“What?!”

Lin Tong, Fang Kai, and City Lord Hei Yun were stunned, their eyes filled with fear.

The heads of the three great aristocratic families of the Black Platform Continent were directly punched to death by Qin Yu!

“Sir, there is no major enmity between us, so let’s just let it go. If you have any needs, we at the Black Platform Continent will do our best to satisfy you.”

Hei Yun’s voice was trembling. He was not only afraid of Qin Yu’s battle prowess he had shown.

But also because his moves just now resembled those of the person in the legend found in the secret room of the City Lord’s Mansion.

That person once stepped through the void, founded the Black Platform Continent, left behind a cultivation technique, and entered the deepest part of purgatory!

“It’s possible to let it go. Send me the spiritual essence of the three great aristocratic families and 70% of the spiritual essence of the Black Platform City.”

“Crazy brat, do you really think we have no way to deal with you?”

Lin Tong’s face filled with a murderous aura.

Hei Yun’s expression darkened at this moment. The legend from ten thousand years ago and the benefits before him, which carried more weight, was right before him.

Even if you had a connection with him, you were not him!

“Senior Qin Yu, help!”

Uncle Qun and a group of Yun family members were suddenly escorted out.

Yun Qingyun and Yun Fengqing were covered in blood as if they had been tortured.

“You appeared from the Yun family’s warship, right? This group of people seems to be in the same group as you. From now on, I will kill every person in a second until you kneel and surrender!”

Lin Tong laughed maniacally. The leader of the Skeleton Gang had sent people to track the Yun family’s warship earlier.

These people were the best threats.

“Ah!”

Uncle Qun let out a scream, and an arm was ripped off.

“Don’t think that I’m joking with you.”

Lin Tong chuckled sinisterly.

Five True Saints held black Soul Binding Chains and surrounded Qin Yu from all sides.

The people who came today had gathered the elites of the three aristocratic families and the City Lord’s Mansion.

They would never allow an outsider to break the rules of the Black Platform Continent. Otherwise, the three great aristocratic families and the City Lord’s Mansion would only exist in name.

“Do you think you can control the lives of others without fear just because you have the resources of the aristocratic families?”

Qin Yu smiled indifferently. He thought of Earth and the Holy Region.

In this remote galaxy, it was this group of people who controlled the resources.

They were high and mighty, controlling the life and death of everyone.

On what ground?

He threw a simple punch. The golden fist suddenly split into four ferocious tigers and directly bombarded the four people.

The four people exploded, and the four Saints died.

“What?”

Lin Tong’s expression changed drastically. He did not expect Qin Yu to attack without hesitation.

“It’s your turn.”

Qin Yu’s palm pressed down in the air. The enormous palm covering the sky and the earth enveloped Lin Tong like a black cloud before a thunderstorm.

“Break!”

Lin Tong’s face was flushed red as he thrust his gigantic sword into the air.

A scorching white light exploded but drowned in his palm the next moment.

“Heaven Cleaving Earth Splitting!”

The head of the Fang family held a divine weapon in his hand. With a flash of saber light, he followed closely behind and slashed at the palm.

Hei Yun’s entire body soared into the sky, and the terrifying internal qi on his body spread out without reservation.

A ball of terrifying black flames blazed on his body. His body was like a bow, and he placed his two fists on his waist.

After that, a black flaming dragon crawled out from his back.

“Black Dragon Wave!” His face flushed red.

The black dragon crashed into the palm with a terrifying dragon roar. The three worked together, and the terrifying palm finally dissipated in the sky.

“Not bad. You could resist a palm strike of mine.”

Qin Yu was expressionless. He stepped forward and intended to attack again.

“Everyone, make a move to stop him! Lin Tong, Fang Kai, and all the elders, set up the formation!”

Hei Yun roared.

People from all directions instantly attacked Qin Yu. The terrifying internal qi caused countless explosions in a split second.

Qin Yu stepped out step by step and blasted apart all the people around him with a punch!

As for the attacks that landed on him, he completely ignored them.

He was like an invincible god of war.

Casually strolling as if taking a leisurely walk in a courtyard, he came to the front of the formation.

“Let me see your grand formation.”

Qin Yu stepped into the formation without hesitation.

Suddenly, Qin Yu seemed to have stepped into another space.

Scarlet lava was rolling on the ground, and white smoke was emitting beside Qin Yu’s feet.

The people walking on the ground were like walking corpses, and various kinds of Demon Beasts lurked in all directions.

Shrill cries were attacking Qin Yu’s divine sense.

“Hahaha, this is the most ancient killing formation on the Black Platform Continent, the Purgatory Formation. Enjoy it!”

Lin Tong laughed maniacally. He did not expect Qin Yu to step into the formation by himself. It was without him making any effort.

“This formation has gathered the most powerful cultivators and magical artifacts on the Black Platform Continent. You should feel contented to die under the Purgatory Formation!”

Hei Yun narrowed his eyes and said.

“This formation once killed cultivators at the half-step Tribulation Transcending Stage. There’s no need to struggle anymore.”

Fang Kai laughed coldly and said.

A continent contained terrifying resources, and after many years of accumulation, there would always be some powerful methods.

And this was their lethal method.

The formation had two family heads, Hei Yun, and many powerful elders as the formation core.
