Chapter 1636: Chapter 1,636, Spring Heart Pill! 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu and Xiao Cao didn’t think too much about it. He took the initiative to pick up the bowl and chopsticks and poured himself a bowl of soup.

Master Zhengyang didn’t say anything, but he already had a plan in his mind. He couldn’t even hide his thoughts.

After the bowl of soup was finished, Qin Yu quickly sensed that something was wrong.

His entire body was emitting intense heat, and his entire body was extremely hot.

He looked at Xiao Cao next to him. Her condition was even worse, and her face was like a ripe apple.

“It’s taking effect so quickly?”Master Zheng Yang could not help but be a little surprised.

He had specially gotten this pill from the pharmacist. He thought that it would take a while for it to take effect, but he did not expect it to take effect so quickly.

“I don’t care about him. Let’s get this kid out of here first,”master Zheng Yang thought to himself.

Then, he looked at Qin Yu and said with a smile, “Qin Yu, you go and rest first. I still have something to say to Xiaocao.”

At this moment, Qin Yu had already sensed that something was wrong. He circulated his meridian circulation technique and looked coldly at master Zheng Yang.

“I haven’t finished eating yet. How can I leave?”Qin Yu resisted the itching in his body and grabbed the chopsticks on the table.

Master Zhengyang said unhappily, “Why are you eating so much in the middle of the night? Hurry up and get some rest.”

Qin Yu was still unmoved, but at this moment, his head was covered in sweat and he almost couldn’t hold on any longer.

“It’s so hot...”

Xiao Cao’s condition was naturally worse. She kept moving around and seemed to be in extreme pain.

“If you want to eat, you can eat here. Xiao Cao, come with me. I have something to tell you.”Master Zhengyang stood up, grabbed Xiao Cao, and was about to leave.

At this moment, Xiao Cao no longer had any ability to resist. This medicinal effect caused her eyes to become somewhat blurred.

Qin Yu grabbed Xiao Cao’s wrist, but he was shocked to find that the spiritual power in his body seemed to be losing, and his strength was continuously decreasing.

“Oh no!”Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically!

What kind of pill was this? Its effect was actually so terrifying!

“This won’t do. We have to leave this place before the medicinal effect explodes...”Qin Yu said in extreme pain.

Then, he grabbed Xiao Cao’s wrist, stood up and said, “We... have to leave first. We’ll come back tomorrow...”

After saying that, Qin Yu forced himself to stand up and planned to take Xiao Cao away from this place.

But at this time, master Zhengyang stood in front of Qin Yu.

“Kid, don’t be ungrateful,”master Zhengyang said with some displeasure.

At this time, Qin Yu didn’t care so much.

He glared at Master Zhengyang and berated, “Old Thing, what did you put in this soup...”

Master Zhengyang laughed loudly and said, “It’s the Spring Heart Pill. Once you take this pill, your body will soon become weak and powerless. The spring heart will not stop. If you don’t deal with it in time, your mind will soon collapse, and even your soul and body will be destroyed!”

“Kid, you don’t want Xiaocao to die, right?”

Hearing this, Qin Yu could not help but angrily berate, “You old dog...”

“Hahahahaha!”Master Zhengyang laughed out loud.

“Isn’t that a small matter for a man? I see that you are also a talent. If you are not rescued in time, a man will also die,”master Zhengyang said indifferently.

“If you put in a few good words, I can let you come with me. How about it?”Master Zhengyang leaned forward and said with a lecherous look.

“F * ck you!”Qin Yu immediately flew into a rage. He suddenly punched Master Zhengyang in the face!

Although Qin Yu’s spiritual power had been lost, the force of his physical body was not something that master Zhengyang could compare with.

With this punch, master Zhengyang was instantly knocked back a few steps!

Qin Yu took advantage of this opportunity to pick up Xiao Cao and turn around to run!

Master Zhengyang got up from the ground and cursed furiously, “Kid, let me tell you, don’t even think about asking me for help. Don’t let me catch you, or else I will tear you to pieces!”

After a loud roar, master Zhengyang called his divine general over and went to look for Qin Yu.

However, this divine general was not a human after all. How could he find Qin Yu? He quickly returned with no results.

Master Zhengyang paced around the room in anger. He gritted his teeth and said, “Damn it, the cooked duck actually flew away. This bastard...”

On the other side, Qin Yu was hugging Xiao Cao and running for his life.

At this moment, Xiao Cao seemed to be unable to resist the medicinal properties. She kept grabbing Qin Yu’s back and exhaling in Qin Yu’s ear like an orchid. She even made sounds from her mouth from time to time.

Qin Yu had no choice. There was no time for him to go back. He could only find an empty house temporarily and settle Xiao Cao Down.

“I’m so thirsty... so uncomfortable...”Xiao Cao curled up on the ground and kept shaking her body.

Qin Yu’s condition was not much better. His mind was filled with thoughts of that kind of thing.

Bean-sized sweat kept pouring out from his forehead, and even his eyes became a little red. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“No... I have to hold it in...”Qin Yu panted heavily. He relied on his remaining consciousness to search for the pill in his mind.

Fortunately, the prescription in his mind was extremely large, and Qin Yu quickly found the antidote to the spring heart pill.

Thus, he hurriedly took out the medicinal cauldron and began to refine the pill.

Herbs were thrown into the medicinal cauldron one after another, and the spiritual fire in Qin Yu’s hand also ignited.

But what made Qin Yu break down was that under such a mental state, he couldn’t even control the spiritual fire!

The flame danced wildly on his palm, and he couldn’t maintain it at all.

At this time, Qin Yu was also beginning to be unable to bear it. He walked toward Xiao Cao many times and stretched out his palm.

But every time, that powerful rationality pulled Qin Yu back.

He gritted his teeth and tried his best to control the spiritual fire, trying to refine the pill.

The flame flickered with a bright light in the cauldron, and Qin Yu’s body kept trembling.

The herbs were melting bit by bit and soon turned into medicinal juice.

But at this moment, Xiao Cao pounced on Qin Yu from behind and hugged him.

She kissed Qin Yu’s neck and said in a trembling voice, “Qin Yu... I’m so uncomfortable...”

Qin Yu closed his eyes tightly and tried his best to stabilize his mind.

At this moment, Xiao Cao stretched out her hand and swam towards Qin Yu’s chest. Her mouth also moved towards Qin Yu.

“No!”

Qin Yu suddenly pushed Xiao Cao Away! His eyes were scarlet red as he said in pain, “I... Will never let Ruoxue down...”

After saying that, he wanted to continue refining the herbs.

However, his mind still collapsed. The spiritual fire in his hand suddenly jumped, directly evaporating the medicinal liquid in the medicinal cauldron!

It was obviously too late for Qin Yu to refine the pill again!

At the same time, Xiao Cao had already pounced on him again.

She hugged Qin Yu’s neck tightly, and her warm lips quickly kissed him.
