Chapter 654: Terrifying Male Corpses! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu immediately took out the two male corpses from his Spatial Magic Artifact!

However, he also felt very uncertain. Facing a Martial Saint Weapon, no one knew if these two male corpses would be able to withstand it or not!

“Whoosh!”

Looking at the two corpses that flew out, everyone was stunned for a moment.

“What are those things?”

“They seem to be... corpses?”

“Is this Qin Yu crazy? Using two corpses to fight against a Martial Saint Weapon?”

Even Qu Xie could not help but burst into laughter.

“Do you think two corpses can die in your place? Childish!” Qu Xie shouted.

The two corpses faced the light of the Martial Saint Weapon!

Qin Yu said helplessly in his heart, “Seniors, I’m sorry. I can only treat you like a shield.”

Just as everyone was laughing, the two corpses had already come forward to welcome them!

“Clang!!”

A loud sound rang out, and waves of terrifying energy billowed out in all directions!

Everyone was forced back several steps by this internal energy! Qin Yu hurriedly used his physical body to protect Yan Ruoxue!

“Hahahaha, Qin Yu, your two corpses... eh?!” Before Qu Xie’s voice could fade away, his expression suddenly changed.

The two corpses were completely unharmed! The supposedly indestructible Martial Saint Weapon did not even leave a single mark! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“How... how is this possible!” Seeing this scene, everyone sucked in a breath of cold air!

What kind of corpses were those? They could actually withstand a blow from the martial saint weapon?

“As I thought, they can withstand it!” Seeing this, Qin Yu could not help but heaved a sigh of relief.

The abilities of these two corpses far exceeded Qin Yu’s imagination!

Even a Martial Saint Weapon was not their opponent at all!

“If I can revive them... then who in the world can stop me!” Qin Yu could not help but feel a little excited.

Not far away, Qu Xie flew into a rage.

A dignified Martial Saint Weapon could not even break two corpses. How could he endure this!!

“Kid, don’t be happy too soon. That was just a small test,” Qu Xie said coldly.

He raised the Prajna ruler and streams of internal strength surged into the ruler.

The entire Prajna ruler immediately flashed with light. Waves of extremely old internal qi spread out from the Prajna ruler!

Just this wave of internal qi alone made people feel suffocated. Some people even vomited blood on the spot.

For a moment, a trace of seriousness appeared on everyone’s faces.

“Retreat!” Yan Jinyao said coldly.

Many young masters of the aristocratic families immediately shot backward, afraid that they would die under the power of this Martial Saint Weapon.

Qin Yu’s expression was equally solemn. He took out a male corpse and placed it in front of him to resist the remaining power.

The other male corpse was prepared to be used to resist this Martial Saint Weapon!

“Seniors, I have offended you, but I really have no other choice. I hope you can forgive me.” Qin Yu cupped his hands towards the male corpses and did not say anything else. He looked at Qu Xie coldly.

“Qin Yu, go to hell!” Qu Xie roared angrily and swung the prajna ruler in his hand towards Qin Yu!

In an instant, a stream of light rippled over like water ripples!

Its power could shake the sky and the Earth. It could make the wind and clouds churn!

“What terrifying power!” The young masters of the aristocratic families could not help but turn pale.

If they were to face this Martial Saint Weapon, they probably would not have the slightest chance of surviving!

Looking at the surging light, Qin Yu shouted and immediately threw the male corpse in his hand over!

“Boom!”

A huge explosion occurred at the scene. For a moment, thick smoke billowed.

Waves of residual power swept out in all directions. Qin Yu hurriedly placed the male corpse in front of him to defend against the residual power.

Taking advantage of this gap, Qin Yu looked at Yan Ruoxue.

“Ruoxue, I’ll think of a way to save you now.” Qin Yu’s hand shook as he took out the bronze sword!

Following that, Qin Yu held the bronze sword in his hand and ruthlessly slashed at the pipe.

“Clang!”

A crisp sound was heard, but the pipe did not move at all!

Qin Yu’s expression could not help but changed drastically. He said in a low voice, “How... how could this be! Even Black Gold Stone can’t be so hard!”

Qin Yu did not give up. He held the bronze sword in his hand and slashed at the pipe again.

Numerous densely packed characters immediately appeared on the pipe. These characters flickered with light and were quite dazzling.

“Could it be because of these characters?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

Qin Yu didn’t recognize any of these characters. He didn’t even know what their origins were.

But it was very obvious that it was impossible to break these characters with brute force!

“Hurry up and leave...” Yan Ruoxue said in a low voice.

“If you die, there’s no point for me to live anymore.”

“At least I’m still safe now. If you’re caught, they’ll kill you...”

Hearing Yan Ruoxue’s words, Qin Yu’s expression turned extremely unsightly.

But Yan Ruoxue was right. If he was caught, there was only one outcome, and that was death.

“Ruoxue, I have my own plans.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“Wait for me. It won’t be long before I take you out of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”

Not far away, the smoke and dust gradually dispersed.

The air was filled with the smell of gunpowder.

Everyone was staring at that spot, eager to know the result.

Crack.

Finally, the male corpse fell to the ground unharmed.

His body was perfect, and not even a mark was left on it.

“How... how is this possible!” Qu Xie’s eyes widened. His expression was as if he had just seen a ghost.

“What... What is this thing? How can it be so hard!”

Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air.

His physical body alone had withstood the full-force attack of the Martial Saint Weapon. Just what kind of creature was this?

“Looks like the man with the mustache didn’t lie to me. The strength of these two corpses probably far surpasses that of a mighty figure.” Qin Yu’s eyes flickered with a sharp light.

Now was definitely not the time to continue talking. Although Qin Yu knew that if he wasn’t captured, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association would continue to torture Yan Ruoxue.

However, Qin Yu had already come up with a plan in his heart.

He put away the two male corpses and then looked at Yan Ruoxue.

“Ruoxue, wait for me.” Qin Yu gritted his teeth and kept the male corpses. He immediately used shrinking earth into an inch and turned to leave.

“You want to leave? In your dreams!” Xie Qu flew into a rage.

In order to capture Qin Yu, they had gone to great lengths. If they failed again, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association would lose all its dignity!

Looking at the direction Qin Yu had fled, Qu Xie’s eyes turned cold. Then, he grabbed the Prajna ruler and swung it in Qin Yu’s direction.

An extremely terrifying power of a Martial Saint surged towards Qin Yu.

Its speed was extremely fast, and he did not even have the time to react.

“Boom!”

This attack smashed fiercely onto Qin Yu’s back!

With just one attack, Qin Yu’s body began to shatter. His entire body was dyed red with blood, and his body fell from midair.
