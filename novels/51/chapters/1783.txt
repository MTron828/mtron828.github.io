1784 The Tong Family in Zhongzhou

The two were not in a hurry when they heard what the sect master of God Bless Sect said.

“With our status, how can we do it ourselves?” they said indifferently.

The sect master of God Bless Sect could not help sneering in his heart.

Their arrogant attitude naturally caused people to feel dissatisfied.

“Alright, I’ll agree with you. However, I have a request,” the sect master of God Bless Sect said.

“Speak! We will satisfy any condition you have,” the two nodded and said.

“I want a Saint Weapon,” the sect master of God Bless Sect said calmly.

Hearing this, the two people’s expressions instantly became somewhat unnatural.

One of them looked at the sect master of God Bless Sect coldly and said, “Do you think Saint Weapon is a cheap item by the roadside?”

“Without Saint Weapon, I’m no match for Xiao Sheng,” the sect master of God Bless Sect said without hesitation.

The two narrowed their eyes and said, “Don’t think we have to rely on you. Your God Bless Sect isn’t the only sect in the East Continent!”

“Then please go back. You can look for other sects.” The sect master of God Bless Sect stood up immediately and was about to leave.

The two frowned slightly, looked at each other, and then said, “Stop!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Why? Is there anything else?” asked the sect master of God Bless Sect.

“Saint Weapon is not a small matter. I’m afraid the two of us can’t make the decision. We have to go back and seek advice from the young master,” they said.

“Give us three days. We’ll give you an answer after three days.”

“Alright, it’s a deal,” the sect master of God Bless Sect replied with a faint smile.

The two did not stay any longer and turned to leave.

The sect master of God Bless Sect remained silent for a long time before he stood up and left the room.

Not long after they left, Jue Wu carefully walked in with Qin Yu.

“Look! I knew there would be leftovers,” Jue Wu said excitedly.

Qin Yu was speechless in an instant. He opened his mouth and didn’t know how to react.

For the sake of eating, Jue Wu was willing to do anything at all.

“D*mn it! The table is full of food, but they didn’t even touch it. It’s such a waste. Let me help you finish them all today!” Jue Wu said excitedly.

After that, she began to indulge in extravagant eating and drinking.

Qin Yu wasn’t as relaxed as Jue Wu. He was sitting there thinking about the scene just now.

Qin Yu could hardly restrain his impulse.

It was as if something was controlling his brain.

Qin Yu knew that it must have something to do with Satan.

Just as Jue Wu was gobbling, the door was pushed open.

They then saw two cultivators looking at them, dumbfounded.

“Who are you guys? Who let you in? Where’s the sect master of God Bless Sect?” The two men glared at them and shouted.

While stuffing her mouth, Jue Wu said, “We are his friends… He’s in the toilet.”

“Nonsense! Since when did the sect master of God Bless Sect have friends like you? You’re thieves, aren’t you?” the two men shouted.

“You dare to come here to steal things. I think you’re courting death!”

Hearing what they said, Qin Yu felt a little irritated.

The killing intent that he had just suppressed began to stir up again.

His face gradually became a little gloomy. He then clenched his fist quietly.

Just as Qin Yu was about to make a move, another person walked in from outside.

This person was tall and had an extraordinary appearance. His body also exuded a faintly discernible sense of oppression.

“Sect Master, these two people ate your food, and we were planning to capture them,” seeing the man walking in, the two of them hurriedly bowed and said.

The sect master of God Bless Sect glanced at Qin Yu and Jue Wu, then waved his hand and said, “They’re my friends. You guys may go.”

The two of them were startled. They then hurriedly bowed and said, “I’m really sorry. We’ve misunderstood…”

After saying this, the two left hurriedly.

Seeing what happened, Qin Yu’s clenched fist slowly loosened.

“Many thanks.” Qin Yu bowed slightly to the sect master of God Bless Sect.

Immediately after that, Qin Yu pulled Jue Wu and said, “Stop eating.”

“It’s okay. Let her eat.” The sect master of God Bless Sect waved his hand.

“Thank you! Thank you! In the future, when you go to Nanzhou, just mention my name, Jue Wu. I guarantee it will work!” Jue Wu said excitedly.

Upon hearing this, the sect master of God Bless Sect frowned and said in surprise, “You’re Jue Wu?”

“Ah? You know me?” Jue Wu asked while she stuffed food into her mouth.

“One of the three lunatics of Nanzhou. I’ve heard about it,” the sect master of God Bless Sect said indifferently.

He then looked at Qin Yu and said, “What about you?”

Qin Yu didn’t hide anything and immediately disclosed his identity.

“You are Qin Yu?” the sect master of God Bless Sect seemed even more surprised.

“In that case, you guys should know Xiao Hai, right?” he asked with a frown.

“Yes. Mr. Xiao is our role model. Does Senior know Xiao Hai too? ” Qin Yu asked in surprise.

He nodded and said, “Xiao Hai and I are old acquaintances. He once saved my life. Without him, I’m afraid I would have died long ago.”

“When did Mr. Xiao come to the East Continent?” Qin Yu asked in surprise.

“No, I used to be in Nanzhou. I was lucky enough to have come to the East Continent.” He shook his head.

“I see.” Qin Yu nodded slightly.

At this juncture, the face of the sect master of God Bless Sect suddenly turned solemn.

“What a coincidence! Please help me pass a message to Xiao Sheng. Tell him that somebody wants to kill him,” he looked at Qin Yu and said.

Qin Yu’s expression changed. He then quickly said, “Somebody wants to kill him? Who’s the person?”

“The Tong family of Zhongzhou has approached me. They wanted me to take action and get rid of Xiao Sheng.” He took a deep breath.

“So, did you agree?” Qin Yu asked, squinting his eyes.

“Mmm, but I put forth a condition. I requested a Saint Weapon from them,” the sect master of God Bless Sect said.

“F*ck! If that’s the case, don’t blame us for being impolite!” Jue Wu suddenly stood up and rolled up her sleeves. She seemed about to attack.

Qin Yu stopped Jue Wu. He shook his head and said, “Since he told us this, there must be a reason behind it.”

“Yes.” The sect master of God Bless Sect nodded.

“Xiao Hai saved my life before, so how could I attack him? Moreover, I’m no match for him at all.”

“Then why did you agree to their request?” asked Qin Yu in a deep voice.

“Because… If I disagree, I’m afraid the Tong family will personally take action. When that happens, I’m afraid Xiao Sheng won’t even have the chance to escape.” The sect master of God Bless Sect shook his head slightly.

Qin Yu finally understood now. He was silent for a moment and then asked, ” “What’s the background of the Tong family?”

“I have no idea. I only know that they are from the aristocratic families of Zhongzhou,” the sect master of God Bless sect said.

“However, since they could take out a Saint Weapon so easily, there must be a True Saint in the family.”
