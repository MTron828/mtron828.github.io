Chapter 363: Yan Sihai’s Conspiracy Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Blue veins popped out on Yan Sihai’s forehead. He had never expected that these people wouldn’t listen to his orders at all!

“Dad, you actually left this girl with a backup plan...” Yan Sihai thought angrily inside.

He looked at Yan Ruoxue coldly and said, “You have your own forces, but you think I don’t?”

Yan Ruoxue said coldly, “Uncle, it has nothing to do with me if you want to fight for control of the family. But if you want to hurt Qin Yu, I won’t agree.”

“Hahahaha!” Yan Sihai couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

He glared at Yan Ruoxue and said, “Well then! Yan Ruoxue, let’s wait and see!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

After saying this, Yan Sihai turned around and left.

He left the Yan family manor and went all the way back home.

In the study room at home, Yan Sihai’s military advisor stood to the side as he listened to Yan Sihai’s story.

After hearing all this, the military advisor smiled and said, “This matter is actually very easy to handle.”

“Easy to handle?” Yan Sihai’s expression turned cold.

“If Yan Ruoxue really goes all out and wants to turn against me, I can’t do anything to her!”

“Just in the Yan family’s manor alone, there are already eight peak stage Inner Strength Grandmasters and a Martial Marquis! Once they fight, it’s very likely that the Yan family will fall apart!”

“Moreover, this is only limited to what I saw. What about outside the Yan family’s manor?”

The military advisor smiled nonchalantly and said, “We only need to force Yan Ruoxue to hand over her power.”

“Aren’t you talking nonsense? If I can make her hand over her forces, would I be so upset?” Yan Sihai snorted coldly.

“The military advisor is right.”

At this moment, another woman walked in from outside the study.

This woman was dressed elegantly and her aura was extraordinary. Every movement she made had the air of an elite.

And this woman was none other than Yan Sihai’s wife, Zhang Yin.

Although Zhang Yin was a woman, she was also famous in Jingdu.

Her ruthlessness rivaled Yan Sihai’s.

Zhang Yin walked straight to Yan Sihai’s side and sat down. She smiled and said, “Old Mister Yan, doesn’t Yan Ruoxue care about Old Mister Yan? Isn’t Old Mister Yan’s corpse outside Jingdu?”

“With your ability, you can make countless people work for you.”

Yan Sihai was also a smart person. He instantly understood!

Then, Yan Sihai stood up and sneered. “Good idea!”

As long as Yan Sihai threatened Yan Ruoxue with Old Mister Yan’s life, then she would definitely hand over the people she controlled!

In contrast to Yan Sihai, what Yan Ruoxue cared about wasn’t power, but Old Mister Yan’s life!

Yan Sihai quickly picked up his phone and dialed the number of the most powerful family at the southwest border, the Cao family.

The Cao family controlled the southwest and could be considered an overlord.

And the head of the Cao family, Cao Shan was a peak Inner Strength Grandmaster!

It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that in the southwest, the Cao family were omnipotent!

At this moment, Cao Shan was sitting in a dark room while enjoying life.

At this moment, his phone rang.

Cao Shan picked up the phone somewhat unhappily and said coldly, “Who is it?”

“Yan Sihai,” Yan Sihai said coldly.

Hearing this name, Cao Shan hurriedly sat up straight.

He said respectfully, “Mr. Yan, why did you suddenly call me?”

Yan Sihai went straight to the point and said, “I want you to kill someone. His name is Qin Yu. He will arrive at the southwest Earth Fiend Valley in the next few days.”

Cao Shan said with an embarrassed smile, “Mr. Yan, can you give me a reason?”

“I don’t need a reason. You only need to follow orders,” Yan Sihai said coldly.

“Otherwise, you know the consequences.”

After saying this, Yan Sihai hung up the phone.

On the other end, Cao Shan couldn’t help but sigh.

“Dad, why are you afraid of him, Yan Sihai?” Next to him, Cao Shan’s son asked somewhat confusedly.

Cao Shan slowly said, “You don’t understand the power of those people in Jingdu.”

If it was someone from another place, Cao Shan wouldn’t be afraid at all. After all, their power didn’t extend this far.

However, the Yan family was different. Their reach extended almost all over the country.

...

At this moment, Qin Yu didn’t know Yan Sihai’s intentions at all.

He was currently looking for the things that needed to be prepared for the Resurrection Formation.

Very quickly, Qin Yu discovered that to activate the Resurrection Formation, at least eight top-notch martial artists above the Inner Strength Past Master level had to activate the formation at the same time.

“Five Inner Strength Past Masters... is not easy to find.” Qin Yu frowned.

After all, Inner Strength Past Masters weren’t as abundant as cabbages on the streets. It wasn’t an easy task to find eight of them quickly.

If he were to call people to head to the southwest at the last minute, it would be too late.

After thinking about it, Qin Yu finally decided to seek help from the local martial arts aristocratic families or the Martial Arts Association.

At most, he would give them a pill or herbs as a reward.

The plane flew through the sky and soon arrived at the southwest region.

After arriving at the southwest region, Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry to go to the Earth Fiend Valley. Instead, he gave Fang Yue a call.

After the call was connected, Qin Yu quickly expressed his intention, “Miss Fang, do you know anyone in the southwest?”

Fang Yue said in surprise, “Southwest? Mr. Qin, why are you going there?”

“It’s more troublesome to explain this matter. In short, I need six Inner Strength Past Masters or Inner Strength Inner Strength Past Masters now,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“Six Inner Strength Past Masters?” Fang Yue was silent for a moment, then said, “It’s not easy to find them... but you can ask the local Martial Arts Association for help.”

Qin Yu forced a smile and said, “I’ve thought of this way too. I’m just afraid that they won’t pay attention to me, so I want you to think of a way.”

Fang Yue smiled and said, “Of course, no problem. Which city are you in?”

Qin Yu said, “Yunchuan City.”

“Okay, wait for my news,” said Fang Yue.

After about ten minutes, Fang Yue called back.

She said on the phone, “Mr. Qin, go to the Martial Arts Association in Yunchuan City. There will be a person called Jia Gong waiting for you.”

“Thank you,” said Qin Yu.

After hanging up the phone, Qin Yu didn’t waste any time. He quickly took a taxi and rushed to the local Martial Arts Association.

After rushing all the way to the Martial Arts Association in Yunchuan City, Qin Yu walked in quickly.

He came to the front desk and said politely, “I’m looking for Mr. Gong Jia.”

The front desk receptionist looked at Qin Yu and said, “Why are you looking for our Vice President Jia?”

Qin Yu quickly said, “I have an appointment with Mr. Jia. Please inform him that my name is Qin Yu.”

“Qin Yu?” The front desk seemed to have already received instructions.

He waved his hand and said, “You can go in. The second room on the second floor is on the left. Vice President Jia is waiting for you.”

“Thank you.” Qin Yu nodded and then quickly walked to the vice president’s office.

After Qin Yu left, the receptionist quickly called Jia Gong.

“Mr. Jia, Qin Yu is here,” said the receptionist.

“Got it.” Jia Gong turned off the phone.

Then, Jia Gong quickly found Cao Shan’s phone number.

“Mr. Cao, Qin Yu is here.”
