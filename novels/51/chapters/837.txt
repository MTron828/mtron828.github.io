Chapter 838: The Holy Land of Cultivation

Qin Yu didn’t stay any longer.

On his way back, all he could think about was how to protect Yan Ruoxue.

After careful consideration, Qin Yuknew what his problem was.

The biggest problem was that he didn’t have enough deterrence.

Although Qin Yu destroyed two sects in one go abroad, no one in the country knew.

Only by increasing his own deterrence, would no one dare to provoke him.

It was just like the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. Even if they didn’t possess great battle prowess, no one would dare to provoke them.

A trace of viciousness flashed across Qin Yu’s eyes.

“The Mystic Realm... . . isn’t under Pyro’s jurisdiction, right?” Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed as he muttered in a low voice.

Since that was the case, then he would make a move against the Mystic Realm.

He would wipe out a Mystic Realm to show the world that he was even more terrifying than the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!

... . .

In a certain clubhouse in Jingdu.

This clubhouse was extremely high end and was different from ordinary clubhouses. Their facilities were indoors, but they had created an outdoor scene.

The surrounding rockery and fake water made it seem as if it was real. This clubhouse really felt like a paradise.

At this moment, in a pavilion in the clubhouse.

Wan Guqiong was sitting there brewing tea.

Opposite him was a middle-aged man.

The man’s strength couldn’t be considered strong. He was only in the middle stage of the Martial Marquis Realm, but his aura was extraordinary. No one dared to underestimate him.

“Guqiong, why are you looking for me?” The middle-aged man asked.

Wan Guqiong smiled faintly and said, “Uncle Le, have some tea first.”

The man called Uncle Le nodded slightly.

After drinking a few mouthfuls of tea, Wan Guqiong finally opened his mouth.

He said in a deep voice, “Uncle Le, the exchange meeting will be held in a few days. The Wan family and your family are both part of the organizers. As for the quota, it’s up to you and me.”

Uncle Le nodded slightly and said, “What’s the matter?”

Wan Guqiong said in a deep voice, “I want you to help me invite someone.”

“Invite someone? Who?” Uncle Le frowned slightly.

A cold light flashed in Wan Guqiong’s eyes.

He said coldly, “Qin Yu.”

Uncle Le frowned slightly and said, “Is it the famous Qin Yu?”

“That’s right.” Wan Guqiong nodded.

Uncle Le smiled and said, “Why didn’t you invite him personally? I think your relationship with him might be closer, right?”

Wan Guqiong sighed and told Uncle Le what happened.

“I have already said that I will never let him participate in this exchange meeting. If I invite him now, it will arouse suspicion.” Wan Guqiong shook his head and said.

This immediately made Uncle Le even more confused.

He frowned and said, “Guqiong, according to what you said, there should be enmity between you and him. If that’s the case, why would you still invite him to the exchange meeting?”

When he heard these words, a trace of viciousness instantly flashed across Wan Guqiong’s eyes.

“Because... I want to kill him!” Wan Guqiong said coldly.

“Martial Saints aren’t allowed to appear in this world. However, without a Martial Saint, it is impossible to kill Qin Yu.”

“As long as I can trick him into the Mystic Realm, I will ask a Martial Saint to make a move and kill him directly!”

Uncle Le suddenly came to a realization.

“For Qin Yu, you want to ask a Martial Saint to make a move?” Uncle Le asked in surprise.

Wan Guqiong nodded and said, “Yes, we must not give him any chance to escape.”

“Uncle Le, as long as you help me, I will definitely remember your kindness!”

Uncle Le was silent for a moment, then he nodded and said, “Okay, I’ll agree to it.”

Wan Guqiong picked up the teacup in his hand and said with a smile, “Then thank you very much, Uncle Le.”

The two of them raised their cups and drank together, reaching an agreement.

On the other side, Qin Yu knew nothing about this.

After he returned to the martial arts academy, he was thinking about how to plunder resources.

This exchange meet was indeed a good choice, but Qin Yu had no chance to step into it.

“Treasures...” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

After careful calculation, Qin Yu had quite a number of treasures in his hands.

Qin Yu had a large number of Divine Rank spellifacts that he had seized from the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets.

But the most precious things were the pill formulas and Divine Rank spells that Qin Yu controlled!

These were all left behind by his father, and their value was immeasurable.

“If I can enter this exchange meeting, I think I have a very high chance of obtaining ten-thousand-year-old herbs,” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

However, Qin Yu quickly felt dejected.

After offending the Wan Guqiong, it was probably impossible for him to enter this exchange meeting.

At this moment, someone suddenly walked in from outside.

“Qin Yu, the President summoned us to the square for a meeting.”

After saying this, he hurriedly ran away.

“A meeting?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

He didn’t think much and immediately stood up and walked towards the square.

Along the way to the square, he saw that many students had already gathered here.

Xia Hang and Gu Xinghe stood at the front.

“Qin Yu!”

At this time, Chang Mang suddenly patted Qin Yu’s shoulder from behind.

Seeing Chang Mang, Qin Yu said with some surprise, “You’re back?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Chang Mang grunted and said, “I just finished dealing with the matters at home and rushed back.”

Then, Chang Mang asked, “How have you been recently? Did anything happen?”

“No.” Qin Yu patted Chang Mang’s shoulder.

Chang Mang swept his gaze over these young masters from Jingdu and said with a cold snort, “I will make these people disappear from this world sooner or later!”

Just as the two of them were chatting, Xia Hang coughed on the stage.

He swept his gaze over the crowd and said lightly, “Next, I want to announce two important decisions.”

“This decision will be made by Gu Xinghe and young master Gu.”

Following that, Xia Hang took out a document.

He held the document and read it out, “According to Pyro’s official request, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association is willing to guide the development of martial arts... . .”

He had said a lot of official words earlier, but they were basically all empty talk.

“Now, we have decided to expand the enrollment of the martial arts academy to a hundred people!”

“Secondly, we will begin the second trip to the Mystic Realm, and the time will be one month later.”

These two decisions immediately caused an uproar.

A second trip to the Mystic Realm? The Jingdu Martial Arts Association was actually going to open up the second Mystic Realm?

“Haha, I’m really lucky. I returned just in time for the second trip to the Mystic Realm,” Chang Mang said with a laugh.

Qin Yu was also somewhat surprised, but his instincts told him that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association seemed to be plotting something.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. For a moment, he couldn’t figure out what the Jingdu Martial Arts Association was planning.

“What’s wrong?” Chang Mang couldn’t help but ask when he saw this.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Nothing.”

“In half a month’s time... my Martial Saint’s power will just disappear,” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

Could it be that they wanted to use this opportunity to get rid of him?

Or could it be that they were afraid that he would completely disappear in half a month’s time? Was that why they used the Mystic Realm as bait?

The possibility was very high!

“This trip to the Mystic Realm will be one of the most important Mystic Realms of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. It will be called a Holy Land of Cultivation internally. I hope that everyone will cherish this opportunity,” Xia Hang continued.
