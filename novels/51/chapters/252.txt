Chapter 253: Divine Medicine In Hand! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

He turned around and saw Fang Yue standing in front of Qin Yu.

Duan Shi frowned and said coldly, “Fang Yue, what do you mean by this?”

Fang Yue chuckled and said, “If it weren’t for Qin Yu, we wouldn’t have had a chance to get our hands on this Divine Medicine.”

“Isn’t it inappropriate to attack now?”

Duan Shi laughed out loud and said, “Fang Yue, when did you become so soft-hearted?”

Fang Yue shook her head and said, “It’s not that I’m soft-hearted. I just hope that Mr. Duan will step back for my sake.”

“Why don’t we split this Divine Medicine equally? How about it?” Qin Yu said.

When he heard this, Duan Shi was even happier inside!

It seemed that Qin Yu really couldn’t hold on anymore. Otherwise, why would he give in?!

Since that was the case, why would he give it to him?

“In your dreams!” Duan Shi snorted coldly.

“If you scram now, I might be able to spare your life.”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “Are you really going to do this?”

“Hehe, do you think I’m joking with you?” Duan Shi roared angrily and rushed towards Qin Yu!

“How dare you?!” At this moment, Jiang Gu roared angrily and raised his hand to meet his attack!

He received Duan Shi’s fist with his palm, but Jiang Gu was still forced back a few steps!

Duan Shi snorted coldly and said, “Old man, don’t get in the way!”

Jiang Gu said coldly, “With me here, don’t even think about taking a step forward!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“You’re really a loyal lap dog!” Duan Shi sneered.

“In that case, I’ll kill you first!” Duan Shi roared angrily and raised his foot to charge at Jiang Gu!

However, at this moment, Qin Yu made a shocking move.

He didn’t help Jiang Gu. Instead, he took this opportunity to charge towards the entrance of the cave!

Duan Shi’s expression changed and he shouted, “Despicable scoundrel! Old man, Qin Yu doesn’t care about you anymore. Get lost!”

He ignored Jiang Gu and rushed towards the entrance of the cave with all his might!

It wasn’t just Duan Shi! The others followed closely behind!

They didn’t expect Qin Yu to abandon Jiang Gu for that Divine Medicine!

Even Jiang Gu himself felt a bit disappointed!

“What’s the use of running? Can you swallow it all in one gulp?” Duan Shi sneered.

Everyone quickly rushed into the entrance of the cave!

A thousand-year-old ginseng floated in the air while shining with a holy light.

Qin Yu stood in front of the ginseng with his hands behind his back, as if he was waiting for something.

“Qin Yu, you despicable person!” Duan Shi roared.

“You want to keep the Divine Medicine for yourself? Qin Yu, aren’t you being too greedy?” The others also said in a derisive tone.

Qin Yu smiled nonchalantly and said, “You guys are right. I do intend to keep the Divine Medicine for myself. So what?”

Everyone was stunned.

Was Qin Yu crazy?

His internal qi was already extremely weak, yet he still dared to boast?

“If that’s the case, then don’t blame me for being merciless!” Duan Shi roared and then rushed towards Qin Yu!

“Clang!”

Qin Yu stood there without moving an inch. He didn’t even look at Duan Shi.

Duan Shi’s expression suddenly changed!

How was this possible?!

Qin Yu was completely fine after this punch?!

Could it be that he was faking it just now?

Duan Shi knew something was wrong. He swung his fist again.

But this punch had the same result. Qin Yu wasn’t affected at all.

“How could this be?” Duan Shi panicked!

Qin Yu sneered and said, “My internal qi is indeed almost dry, but unfortunately for you, there is a restriction around this Divine Medicine. Your internal qi was also suppressed.”

After Qin Yu’s reminder, they realized that they couldn’t use their internal qi at all!

In other words, in this valley, they could only rely on physical strength!

“How could this be?” These people were all panicking.

“If we could only rely on physical strength, wouldn’t Qin Yu be invincible?”

“Who can compete with him in terms of physical strength?”

Duan Shi’s expression was extremely ugly. He looked at Jing Lu, who wasn’t far away.

“Mr. Duan, how could you do such a thing?” However, Jing Lu’s words made Duan Shi even more desperate!

“Although we are friends, I don’t like your behavior,” Jing Lu continued.

Duan Shi said angrily, “Jing Lu, you...”

“Pfft!”

Before Duan Shi could finish speaking, Jing Lu took a step forward and directly punched through Duan Shi’s chest!

“It’s a disgrace to be friends with you,” Jing Lu shook his head and said.

Duan Shi’s eyes widened, and his huge body fell straight down.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

Jing Lu was really a ruthless and merciless person.

“Mr. Qin, I killed him for you. Take it as an apology,” Jing Lu said with a smile.

Qin Yu didn’t pay attention to him. He sat cross-legged beside the Divine Medicine and slowly recovered the spiritual power in his body.

During this time, someone tried to approach the Divine Medicine, but his head was smashed by Qin Yu.

After more than an hour, Qin Yu finally stood up from the ground.

“This Divine Medicine belongs to me,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Then, he stretched out his hand and directly held the Divine Medicine in his hand!

The surrounding light disappeared in an instant, and the valley instantly dimmed.

Qin Yu kicked the Divine Medicine and said coldly, “Everyone, are you guys still not leaving? I’m leaving first.”

Only then did everyone come to their senses.

They felt resentful.

Not only did they not get anything this time, but they almost died here!

“Congratulations, Mr. Qin!” Jing Lu cupped his hands and said.

Qin Yu glanced at him, then suddenly raised his hand, and pressed it on Jing Lu’s shoulder!

In an instant, Jing Lu felt a huge force on his shoulders! His knees couldn’t help but sink down!

“Bang!” Jing Lu knelt on the ground!

“Jing Lu, don’t think that I don’t know what you’re thinking,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“You better not try to scheme, or else...”

Before he could finish his words, Qin Yu’s strength increased by a few times!

Boom!

Jing Lu’s knees smashed into the ground! He sank down hard!

What four great geniuses? In front of Qin Yu, they were insignificant!

Qin Yu let go, turned around and walked out of the valley.

Jing Lu knelt on the ground and his expression was contorted!

“Qin Yu, you dare... you dared to make me kneel?!” Jing Lu’s entire body trembled.

“I will definitely kill you! I will definitely kill you!” Jing Lu thought inside!

He had been revered as a genius since he was young, but he had never suffered such humiliation!

Qin Yu and Jiang Gu strode out of the valley.

After obtaining this Divine Medicine, Qin Yu was completely confident that he would be able to reach the peak of the Foundation Establishment Stage or even the Monastic Stage!

At that time, Qin Yu would no longer need to rely on the power of the ancestor to fight against an Inner Strength Grandmaster.

“Mr. Qin.”

At this moment, Dong Tianhai brought his disciple to Qin Yu.

He cupped his hands and said, “Congratulations, Mr. Qin, for obtaining the Divine Medicine.”

Qin Yu said with a nonchalant smile, “Master Dong, what’s the matter?”

Dong Tianhai couldn’t help but complain inside. He braced himself and asked, “Did you... take the Nine Transformation Golden Pill?”

Qin Yu sneered. “Didn’t you say that it was a fake?”
