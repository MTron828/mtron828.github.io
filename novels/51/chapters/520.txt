Chapter 521: The Wedding Was Approaching Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The meeting room fell into silence once again.

Everyone was silent, as if they were all thinking about this matter.

Xia Hang said somewhat anxiously, “No matter what, we must get rid of Qin Yu, and we must do it as soon as possible, otherwise, there will be endless trouble in the future!”

“Xia Hang, you should go back first.” However, in the end, they still didn’t listen to Xia Hang’s opinion.

“We will discuss this matter and then make a decision.”

Xia Hang clenched his teeth and said anxiously, “If Qin Yu really grows more powerful, then...”

“If I ask you to go back, do it!”

A voice came from the dark again.

Xia Hang was instantly speechless.

Although he was the vice president of the Martial Arts Association, Xia Hang knew very clearly inside that his main responsibility as the vice president was to face those aristocratic families.

To put it bluntly, he was just a bridge between the Martial Arts Association and the various aristocratic families.

As long as these higher-ups wanted to, they could make him disappear at any time.

Xia Hang had no choice but to walk out of the meeting room.

After coming out of the meeting room, Xia Hang thought about it and finally decided to look for Han Wei and Yan Sihai to discuss this matter

“Since the Martial Arts Association won’t make a move, I can only convince these two aristocratic families to get rid of Qin Yu!” Xia Hang said coldly.

...

In the clubhouse, Xia Hang, Han Wei, and Yan Sihai sat together.

“I suggest that we get rid of Qin Yu as soon as possible.” Xia Hang looked at Han Meng.

Han Meng had always supported attacking Qin Yu in advance, so he could only place his hopes on Han Meng.

However, Han Meng’s attitude changed drastically. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

He laughed and said, “Mr. Xia, I agreed with you before, but after my son came out of seclusion, I changed my mind.”

“With my son’s current ability, getting rid of Qin Yu is a piece of cake!”

Xia Hang’s expression changed, and he hurriedly said, “If we do it too late, something unexpected might happen. There are still close to 20 days left, and no one can guarantee what will happen in these 20 days!”

Han Meng sneered and said, “What? As Han Wei’s mentor, don’t you have confidence in him? Do you think my son is inferior to Qin Yu?”

Xia Hang frowned. “Of course I don’t mean that.”

“As far as I know, my son’s ability is now above yours, right?” Han Meng snorted lightly.

Xia Hang was speechless.

“Alright, when the time comes, I will set up an inescapable net.” Yan Sihai took a puff of his cigar.

“As long as Qin Yu dares to appear, regardless of whether he wins or loses, I won’t let him leave Jingdu!”

Xia Hang could only nod his head.

“I hope Qin Yu won’t run away in advance,” Xia Hang thought to himself.

...

Above the Dragon Vein, the man with the mustache wandered around for nearly two hours.

“This is the place.” The man with the mustache stepped on the ground and began to work.

Relatively speaking, the Bright Energy Grave was much simpler than the Dark Energy Grave.

Not only that, but the treasures inside the Bright Energy Grave were more precious than those of the Dark Energy Grave.

After the Bright Energy Grave was opened, a surge of bright energy rushed towards him.

One magic artifact after another was placed in the Bright Energy Grave.

“I’m rich!” The man with the mustache said excitedly.

Qin Yu’s eyes lit up. There were Divine Rank magic artifacts in there! There were even several Earth Rank magic artifacts!

“Sigh, I really can’t bear to give you these treasures,” the man with the mustache said with some heartache.

Qin Yu didn’t pay attention to him. He walked into the Bright Energy Grave and carefully examined them.

One of the Artifact Refining Cauldrons caught Qin Yu’s attention.

This Artifact Refining Cauldron was entirely jade-green. Even though it was covered in dust, it still couldn’t conceal the jade-green color of its entire body.

“I want this Artifact Refining Cauldron,” Qin Yu pointed at it and said.

The man with the mustache muttered, “That won’t do! This Artifact Refining Cauldron is also useful to me.”

Qin Yu muttered, “How about this? Other than this Artifact Refining Cauldron, I don’t want anything else. How about it?”

The man with the mustache was stunned. He hurriedly said, “Is what you said true?”

“Yes.” Qin Yu nodded.

“But I have a condition.”

The man with the mustache said with a smile, “Bro, let alone one condition, I will agree to ten conditions!”

Qin Yu looked at the man with the mustache and said, “I want you to take me to three Big Graves!”

“Big Graves?” The man with the mustache frowned slightly.

He touched his chin and said, “Big Graves are not easy to find...”

“It doesn’t matter if you have looted them before. What I want is dark energy,” said Qin Yu.

The man with the mustache blinked, then patted his chest and said, “No problem!”

“Okay, it’s a deal.” Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief.

According to Qin Yu’s self-speculation, the three graves could possibly help him step into the half-step Martial Marquis Realm!

The half-step Martial Marquis realm wasn’t a clear realm to begin with. To put it bluntly, it was just a transitional realm, just a bit away from the Martial Marquis realm.

It was precisely this little bit of distance that had many people stuck for their entire lives.

Although the current Qin Yu was already powerful enough, he didn’t understand Han Wei well.

There couldn’t be any accidents during their fight! Therefore, stepping into the Martial Marquis realm was a safe bet!

“When do we set off?” Qin Yu asked.

The man with the mustache held the Magic Artifact as he muttered, “How can it be so fast? I’ve forgotten many places. You’d better wait for my notice.”

At this point, the man with the mustache picked out a Magic Artifact and said with a smile, “Spatial Magic Artifact. This thing isn’t bad...”

Then, the man with the mustache tried to activate this Magic Artifact.

“Buzz!”

A ray of light flashed, and the man with the mustache disappeared without a trace.

“D*mn it, where is he?!” Qin Yu was instantly anxious.

The two of them didn’t even leave their contact details, and he left just like that?

“Oh no, did I get cheated?” Qin Yu frowned, and he was a little flustered.

Qin Yu waited on the Dragon Vein for an entire day, but the man with the mustache still didn’t come back.

“F * ck, this b*stard,” Qin Yu said angrily.

Not only did he take the treasures, but he even ran away!

With no other choice, Qin Yu could only leave this place temporarily.

Qin Yu returned to Chuzhou.

At this moment, Fang Yue was still lying unconscious on the bed.

“Mr. Qin, if this girl continues like this, will she die?” Yao Qing rubbed his chin and muttered softly.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He was a little worried inside.

He Teng had already escaped. It wouldn’t be easy to find him.

‘I wonder if the man with the mustache will have a way,’ Qin Yu thought to himself.

The man with the mustache looked crazy, but Qin Yu had a feeling that this person wasn’t simple.

It was already the end of August. There were only sixteen days left until September 9th!

The news of Han Wei and Yan Ruoxue’s wedding began to spread!

Almost everyone in Jingdu was discussing this matter.

Some people even claimed that this wedding was the wedding of the century!

The marriage between the two great families had attracted the attention of countless people!
