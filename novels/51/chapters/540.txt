Qin Yu’s voice wasn’t loud, but it reached everyone’s ears.

He stared at Yan Sihai and the others.

Yan Sihai slowly stood up.

He was smoking a cigar as usual, and there was a hint of contempt on his face.

“Qin Yu, you did win, but so what?” Yan Sihai said indifferently.

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold and he said, “What do you mean?”

Yan Sihai sneered. “You only beat Han Wei. Do you think you beat us?”

“You want to take her away? Are you worthy enough?”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “The dignified President Yan actually went back on his words?”

Yan Sihai laughed loudly and said, “The one who promised you is Han Wei, not us! When did I promise you?”

The anger on Qin Yu’s expression deepened. He took a deep breath and said, “I must leave with Ruoxue today. I will kill whoever dares to stop me!”

“How arrogant!” Yan Sihai said coldly.

Yan Sihai waved his hand and dozens of people with guns rushed out!

Countless black muzzles were aimed at Qin Yu!

After a short while, more powerful internal qi came out.

They saw eight Martial Marquis slowly walking towards Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, you have to die here today,” Yan Sihai said coldly.

Qin Yu glanced at the crowd and couldn’t help but clench his fists.

“Yan Sihai, you are a despicable person who goes back on his words! Aren’t you afraid of ruining the reputation of the Yan family?” Qin Yu said angrily.

Yan Sihai sneered and said, “Tarnish the Yan family’s reputation? Qin Yu, who do you think will dare to spread the news?”

“Let me tell you, you have no idea what kind of people you are facing!”

Qin Yu swept his gaze across the crowd. Just as he had said, this group of people didn’t care about the truth.

“I can only maintain my current condition for five minutes at most.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

Five minutes? It was impossible to kill eight Martial Marquises in five minutes!

He wouldn’t be able to kill all of them!

As long as they could last five minutes, the one who would die today would definitely be Qin Yu!

“Qin Yu, you really should stay.”

At this moment, three more Martial Marquises walked out!

These three wore white robes, and on their chests was the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s logo!

“I didn’t expect the people from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association to come!”

“Eleven Martial Marquises, this... this is simply shocking!”

“With such power, it’s hard to escape even if you have wings!”

Qin Yu’s expression became even more unsightly. He didn’t expect the people from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association to actually come!

“Qin Yu, do you understand now?” Yan Sihai said indifferently.

“So what if you win? As long as we want to kill you, you have no chance to resist at all.”

“Who can help you?”

Qin Yu glanced at the crowd coldly. His energy surged and he said coldly, “Bring it on. I, Qin Yu, have nothing to fear!”

“Humph, Qin Yu, we aren’t fools,” said a Martial Marquis coldly.

“Before long, your strength will disappear. At that time, you will be at our mercy. There is no need for us to fight with you.”

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely ugly. The qi energy in his body had already begun to disappear. It was even faster than he had imagined!

This kind of spell that forcefully increased one’s strength would definitely cause one to fall into a seriously injured state after using it!

At that time, not to mention a Martial Marquis, but Qin Yu wouldn’t even be able to deal with an Inner Strength Grandmaster!

“If I’m not mistaken, you are already starting to run out of strength.” Martial Marquis Bai said with a smile.

“Congratulations on defeating Han Wei today. Unfortunately, today will be the anniversary of your death.”

Qin Yu remained silent. He could feel the internal qi in his body disappearing rapidly, and his body was getting heavier and heavier.

The Martial Marquis power finally dissipated, and pain spread throughout Qin Yu’s body.

“Pfft!”

He spat out a mouthful of blood.

He kneeled on the ground and tried to get up, but he couldn’t.

“Hahaha!” Everyone couldn’t help but laugh when they saw this.

“This kid has already lost the ability to resist. Everyone, make your move and kill him directly.”

No one knew who was the first to reach out with his palm, but a terrifying internal qi instantly closed in on Qin Yu!

“Boom!”

However, at this moment, a purple flame burst out from not far away and collided with this force!

The light that was supposed to rush towards Qin Yu instantly disappeared!

“Who is it?!” The spellcaster shouted.

“You guys are really despicable. In front of so many people, you’re bullying the weak and the strong. Don’t you think it’s shameful?” A clear and cold voice sounded.

They saw the Pavilion Master standing beside Qin Yu.

“The Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?” The people from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association narrowed their eyes.

“Ji Yuhong, you won’t be able to protect Qin Yu today.”

“That’s right. You’re just one person, but we have eleven Martial Marquises!”

The Pavilion Master’s expression didn’t change as she said indifferently, “Is that so? Then you can come and try!”

The Pavilion Master stomped her foot, and a purple flame spread out once again!

“Ji Yuhong! Don’t do whatever you want just because you have someone protecting you!” Someone shouted.

“If you don’t want to die, then get lost. You can’t change anything by yourself!”

The Pavilion Master remained silent, but she was determined to fight.

“If that’s the case, then don’t blame us for being merciless!” The eleven Martial Marquises walked forward at the same time, and their internal qi started to collide.

“What about me?”

At this moment, another voice sounded!

They saw an old man with white hair slowly walking out.

When they saw this old man, a trace of confusion appeared on the faces of everyone present.

“Who is this old man? Why haven’t I seen him before?”

“I don’t know. From his hunched body, he’s probably a farmer, right?”

“Why is a farmer coming out to join in the fun? How did he sneak in?”

Just as everyone was discussing, the expressions of these Martial Marquis suddenly changed.

“You... You’re Jiang He?!” Someone exclaimed.

“Jiang... Jiang He? That Jiang He who is as famous as Ye Qing?!”

“Why would he appear here? Didn’t they say that he has gone into seclusion?”

Jiang He didn’t say anything. He slowly walked to the side of the Pavilion Master. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Greetings, Mr. Jiang.” The Pavilion Master bowed slightly.

Jiang He nodded in return.

On the stage, Yan Sihai and the others had ugly expressions on their faces.

Yan Sihai suddenly slammed the table and stood up. He pointed at Jiang He and scolded, “Jiang He, this matter has nothing to do with you. You’d better not interfere!”

“That’s right. We all know that you’re powerful, but you’re not Ye Qing. You’re just a martial artist! You can’t change anything!”

Unlike Ye Qing, Ye Qing had already entered the military district and had extremely powerful authority.

Jiang He, on the other hand, had always been an unaffiliated person. Although he was powerful, he had no connections to speak of.

With his hands behind his back, Jiang He said calmly, “I must take this person away today. If anyone isn’t willing to accept it, you’re welcome to take action.”
