2275 The Evil Exterminator Attacks

Just taking a step back was enough to shock everyone. After all, the masked woman was an existence who killed the sect master of the Immortal Slaying Sect in one blow.

His sword strikes were usually without reservation.

The eleven massive iron chains once again released a strange suction force. They seemed to be trying to extract all the cultivation methods and the way they had comprehended.

His spiritual energy was depleting at a speed visible to the naked eye, and his divine sense was also wildly being extracted.

Everyone tried to resist this suction force with all their might, but their resistance was particularly insignificant in the face of the vast gap in strength.

Moreover, what shocked Qin Yu was that a divine sense began interfering with his soul as if it wanted to snatch control of his body.

The black Qin Yu had opened his eyes at some point in time. A portion of his divine sense was wrapped in ghostly qi. Under such circumstances, he was slightly stronger when compared to the dispirited golden Qin Yu. A bad feeling surged into Qin Yu’s heart.

He tightly controlled the black figurine in his divine sense. If anything happened again at this time, he would definitely die.

Situ Haoyue and Chang Ye seemed to be under immense pressure at the scene. From their expressions and trembling bodies, they seemed unable to hold on any longer.

“The masked woman’s attack power is probably based on strength. Zong Yue’s strength is very limited, and his comprehension of the Path of Heaven is also very limited. Even if she drains his body, it won’t help the masked woman at all. Therefore, the power of the attack against him is relatively small.”

Qin Yu thought to himself.

“Boom!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Suddenly, Chang Ye thrust his palm forward, and a few hundred meters long talismans flew past Qin Yu.

The terrifying destructive power instantly tore a hole in Qin Yu’s hard body. Qin Yu was scared out of his wits. If this directly hit his body, he would be severely injured!

“Chang Ye, aim properly before you attack!”

Qin Yu roared,

At this moment, Chang Ye’s face was ashen. His soul seemed to have been overly extracted, and he was completely unable to lock onto the masked woman’s position.

At this moment, a terrifying soul power suddenly erupted from Uncle Ling’s body.

Qin Yu felt a vast soul river rushing past him, and the power of the soul suddenly formed a massive vortex in front of the masked woman.

“Soul Vortex!”

A massive divine sense twisted, and its sound rushed down like a waterfall from thousands of feet high. In an instant, Qin Yu felt his soul was torn apart.

Qin Yu was a little shocked. Even though he was only at the edge, he could feel such a terrifying suction force, let alone the masked woman in the middle of the vortex.

The evil exterminator, Uncle Ling, and Ling Yurou had always acted together. Qin Yu only knew that Uncle Ling was a soul cultivator, but he did not expect his soul power to be so terrifying. No wonder no one objected to him entering this Mystic Realm.

At this moment, the terrifying suction force had been released to the extreme. The terrifying Soul Vortex was spinning madly like the gates of hell.

The masked woman’s figure seemed to overlap slightly in the space the naked eye could not see.

Qin Yu’s desolate divine eye saw that the masked woman’s body seemed elongated. It was actually a part of the masked woman’s soul that had been torn out!

The moment he saw the masked woman’s soul, Qin Yu felt as if his soul was in an ice cave. That feeling was the sixth sense of humans when they encountered extreme danger.

A terrifying pressure spread out in the space. In the desolate divine eye, Qin Yu saw the masked woman step forward, and her soul directly passed through the door of the vortex, wherever her soul went.

Black lightning raged, and the door of the vortex instantly shattered. The sound of shattering space spread everywhere.

In less than a breath’s time, she resumed her previous posture as if she had never moved.

Qin Yu only felt drenched in cold sweat all over his body. The speed at which the masked woman’s divine soul traveled was so fast that even the desolate divine eye could not capture it.

“Woman of nine lifetimes, the blood of countless human lives on your body must be repaid. Today, this place shall be your burial ground.”

The evil exterminator suddenly opened his eyes. His body suddenly burst out with an indescribable power.

A massive surge of the power of Path of Heaven penetrated this space and entered his body.

In an instant, a terrifying storm raged through the space, and an immense power managed to temporarily force back the iron chain of the way that had been binding him.

The evil exterminator’s body emitted a magnificent aura, and the immense power of the Path of Heaven surged into his body like a tidal wave.

He threw away the sword in his hand and walked toward the masked woman step by step.

The two immense forces slowly collided, and the clashing sound of the way resounded throughout the entire space.

The evil exterminator’s body was like a giant sword. His body turned into the Sword of the Path of Heaven as he walked toward the masked woman step by step.

The masked woman’s expression did not change. She allowed the terrifying sword energy to rush over her like a tidal wave. She was like a giant ship in the sea, unmoving at all.

“This is my Sword of the Path of Heaven.”

The evil exterminator stared at the masked woman and said softly. The iron chain on his body emitted an intense frictional sound as he walked a certain distance. Then, fine cracks began appearing at the place closest to the evil exterminator.

“So terrifying! It must be True Saint’s utmost power of rules.”

The rules of annihilation that he comprehended now were simply too inferior compared with the rules of the Way of the Sword in front of the evil exterminator.

Moreover, the evil exterminator’s aura seemed to have a mysterious aspect. With every step he took, his aura would increase by a level.

Qin Yu’s body was now comparable to a demon beast, but he felt a wave of pain. The aura on the evil exterminator’s body would leave a wound when it brushed past him.

“How terrifying!”

Elder Guai was looking at everything outside the Sumeru ring. His voice was trembling.

“Who is this guy? Elder Guai, do you know?” Qin Yu frowned and asked.

“The evil exterminator seems to have been born to uphold the Path of Heaven. The legend in this galaxy depicts him as a fierce enemy of evil. If you violate the rules of the human race, such as slaughtering a large number of human cultivators or posing a great threat to human cultivators, he will take action. Some people said that his family was harmed by evil, so he detested evil. Others said he was born according to destiny, which was why his strength was so terrifying!”

Elder Guai was also unsure. The evil exterminator seemed to be a mystery.

Qin Yu nodded. Even in the Holy Region, With such terrifying strength, the evil exterminator was probably one of the few top-notch people. It was unknown why he was trapped in this galaxy all this while.
