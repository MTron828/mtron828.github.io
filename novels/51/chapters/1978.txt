1979 Gu Xinghe’s Tactics

Gu Xinghe’s expression was extremely gloomy. He clenched his fists tightly, especially when he saw the few big words left on the wall.

“Which b*stard is this?” Gu Xinghe was almost driven mad!

Somebody actually stole the treasures he had worked so hard for it!

Yang Tong, by the side, stepped forward. He tried to deduce the past to find out who had done this.

!!

However, how could Yang Tong be a match for the man with the mustache? The man with the mustache had wiped away all the traces left there. What he deduced and saw in the past was just blank.

“He’s indeed a top-notch martial artist,” Yang Tong took a deep breath, his face turning cold.

“Someone has stolen our things, and we have no way of finding out who he actually is,” someone by the side said.

“A person like this would have tremendously good tactics. It’s better to be careful.”

Everyone turned to look at Gu Xinghe.

“Someone has to take the blame for this,” Yang Tong said bluntly. “After all, we also need to have an explanation.”

Gu Xinghe sneered and said, “I’ve long thought about it. Besides the mysterious person of the demon race, there’s a companion.”

“And that companion is Qin Yu.”

As soon as he said this, several people instantly looked shocked.

“Qin Yu? The Qin Yu who fought Si Shifeng not long ago?” Yang Tong was puzzled and asked.

“That’s right,” Gu Xinghe nodded and said. “I chose to make the move on that day because Qin Yu was also at the auction that day!

“Isn’t the Si family unable to find an excuse to do anything to Qin Yu? I’ll give them one.”

Hearing what he said, the people couldn’t help but sigh and say, “Your strength isn’t that great, but in terms of despicableness, you’re second to none. You’re the best.”

Gu Xinghe was not angry. Instead, he said proudly, “Back then, I almost killed Qin Yu using this method. It’s a pity he was lucky and managed to survive. This time, he must die!”

…

In the Imperial Palace in Sky City, the respective aristocratic families had sent people to station themselves in the palace.

On the surface, they seemed to care for the prince, but in reality, they did not care about any of the prince’s requests.

“Sigh!” The prince couldn’t help but let out a long sigh, feeling somewhat sad and worried.

“Your Highness, why don’t you ask the old generals around you to drive them away?” Qin Yu asked.

“Then I’ll fall into their trap,” the prince said, looking at Qin Yu.

“Fall into their trap?” Qin Yu was a little surprised.

“Yes,” the prince said. “If we make the first move, then the rule of no fighting in Sky City will be gone completely.”

Qin Yu finally understood.

“But if this continues, they will force you to break this rule with your own hands. They will also go more and more overboard,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“That’s right,” the prince sighed and said. “But in the current situation, there’s nothing that I can do.”

“Why didn’t you choose to leave Sky City? The world is so big. You can go anywhere,” Qin Yu said.

The prince shook his head and said, “I don’t want to leave. This is my home. I’m not going anywhere.”

“Moreover… Do you think I can leave? They’ve already sent people to watch my every move.”

After thinking about it, it made sense. After all, the prince controlled the spirit coins and was the only person who could obtain them. The great aristocratic families certainly would naturally not let him leave easily.

“I can only take one step at a time,” the prince said helplessly.

After saying that, he started coughing severely again.

Perhaps it was because of the emotional fluctuations that had made him look even weaker.

“You’d better rest early,” Qin Yu said.

The prince nodded and was supported by his people back to his room.

“Sigh! This bunch of b*stards really went too far this time.” Jue Wu, by the side, sighed as she gnawed on a big duck leg.

“An important person that has lost his power is even more inferior than common people,” Qin Yu couldn’t help but shake his head.

As for the fall of the royal family, Qin Yu did not feel much. After all, if the royal family existed, they would not be any stronger than the nine great aristocratic families.

“If I were the prince, I would have beaten them up long ago. Look at how they made the threatening gestures,” Jue Wu said angrily.

Qin Yu looked in the direction of the Great Hall. True enough, these people were still abiding by the rules on the first day, but they revealed their true nature a few days later.

Not only did they simply use the royal family’s treasures, but they also ate, drank, and had fun in the Great Hall, like local ruffians.

Of course, Qin Yu had no right to intervene in this matter. Thus he could only turn a blind eye.

“Let’s go. Come with me to the back mountain,” Qin Yu said to Jue Wu.

“Mmm,” Jue Wu responded. Like a little bodyguard, she followed Qin Yu closely.

However, before they reached the back mountain, a personal attendant of the prince ran over in a hurry.

“Mr. Qin, something has happened.” The attendant knitted his brows tightly.

“What happened?” Qin Yu asked.

“The auction house has issued a statement, they…” the attendant said in a low voice.

“What did they do? Quickly tell us. Don’t waste time!” Jue Wu said impatiently.

The attendant raised his head, looked at Qin Yu, and said in a deep voice, “They said you’re the spy who stole the auction items.”

Qin Yu’s expression instantly changed drastically when he heard that!

...

“Isn’t that pure nonsense? D*mn it! Did the auction house’s people squeeze their heads by the door?” Jue Wu cursed.

Qin Yu remained silent. He seemed to have guessed something.

“A bunch of b*stards. They want to use this opportunity to drag me down…” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

He had never expected himself to be put on the royal family’s side.

“Don’t stop me. I’m going to tear down the auction house!” Jue Wu was furious. She got up and directly left the palace.

Her speed was so fast that even Qin Yu could not stop her.

“This Jue Wu…” Qin Yu opened her mouth, feeling helpless.

In the evening of the same day, the news spread. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“The number one auction house in the Holy Region was shattered by a Little Lolita and turned into ruins. All the treasures had been destroyed and buried, no longer in existence.”

The entire Sky City was shocked by this piece of news!

Such a thing had never happened before in all these years! And no one had ever dared to make a move on the auction house.

...

Of course, the auction house didn’t do anything about Jue Wu’s actions. In fact, no one made a move against her.

It was simply because of the rule that no fighting was allowed in Sky City.

By the time Jue Wu returned, the sky had turned dark completely.

“D*mn! I’ve finally vented my anger,” Jue Wu said angrily after her return.

“What you did is exactly what they’ve wanted,” Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

This way, the auction house would have an excuse to attack Qin Yu.

Of course, Qin Yu didn’t care. Even if Jue Wu didn’t take action, they would still blame it on him.

He who had a mind to beat his dog would easily find his stick.
