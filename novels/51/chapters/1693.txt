Chapter 1694: Chapter 1,694, tears of the exalted Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Back on Earth, Qin Yu had once heard rumors that the Heavenly Court had established Satan in the East Peak.

All along, there had been countless rumors regarding the east peak, but they were only limited to rumors.

But now, the venerable fifth mountain in Qin Yu’s hands had actually reacted with the divine tea token!

“Could it be that those rumors are true…”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice, feeling even more incredulous!

At the same time, this also caused Qin Yu’s interest in the token to grow even stronger.

Regardless of whether this was related to the rumors on Earth or not, it was enough to prove that the divine tea token on the stage was definitely not simple!

Not far away, the young man’s gaze also became increasingly fiery. The corners of his mouth curled up, as if he was determined to obtain it.

This caused a bad premonition to arise in Qin Yu’s heart. His face was gloomy and he did not say a word, as if he was calculating the gains and losses.

At this moment, the host on the stage spoke.

He held the divine tea token in his hand and looked somewhat unnatural.

Then, he hurriedly put the token back into the box and said, “According to the owner’s request, the owner of the token has to decide for himself.”

“Barter?”

Hearing this, the people participating in the auction immediately discussed animatedly.

“When I came here, I didn’t hear of such a rule.”

“Yeah, barter. We weren’t prepared at all.”

“Damn, I prepared so many spirit coins. Isn’t it a waste of time?”

“Sigh, forget it. Such an item probably wouldn’t fall into our hands. Even if we were lucky enough to obtain it, it wouldn’t be an opportunity, but a calamity.”

Hearing this, everyone’s gazes once again turned towards the young man.

The strength that the young man had unleashed was definitely not something that they could compare to.

What was even more terrifying was his age. To have such a cultivation at such a young age, who knew what kind of background he had behind him!

“The auction of the token has officially begun,”the host said.

As the sound of his voice faded, people began to take out their treasures.

“I’m willing to exchange a sacred dragon mushroom for that token!”Someone shouted.

“Sacred Dragon Mushroom?”

As soon as he said this, everyone was shocked!

The Sacred Dragon Mushroom was a special spiritual medicine. Rumor has it that it grew in the sky and was nourished by the air.

Because its appearance was like a divine dragon, it was named the Sacred Dragon Mushroom.

“It seems that these people are well-hidden,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He had heard of the Sacred Dragon Mushroom. It was definitely a supreme treasure!

They had taken out such a treasure at the beginning of the auction. It seemed that the auction was not that simple.

“The Sacred Dragon Mushroom is nothing. I am willing to use the absolute beginning clouds to exchange for this item!”At this moment, someone shouted.

Hearing this, everyone was even more shocked!

The absolute beginning clouds! It was said to be the first wisp of divine glow from the absolute beginning clouds! It was a true supreme treasure!

Of course, there were many rumors about the absolute beginning glow, but that was only limited to rumors.

Compared to the absolute beginning glow, the Holy Dragon Ganoderma suddenly didn’t seem as alluring.

And the owner of the token had a strange glint in his eyes. He didn’t seem to think that this token would be able to exchange for so many treasures!

Then, someone else took out their most precious treasures. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Immortal Iron, Poison Scripture, Long Yan, and so on. All kinds of treasures appeared one after another, which shocked everyone!

Qin Yu was no exception. He didn’t expect these people to have so many treasures in their hands!

The owner of the token was getting more and more excited. He couldn’t wait to agree immediately.

However, this thing had already been taken to the auction, so it naturally had to follow the arrangements of the auction and follow their rules. Therefore, he could only be anxious at the side.

The young man not far away had a calm expression, and the corner of his mouth still hung a trace of an extremely confident smile.

It was very obvious that this person was hiding an even more alluring treasure in his hands!

Qin Yu did not make a sound either. He rummaged through the cabinets and found many supreme treasures, even the Huangji Buddha Flame!

However, before that young man made a move, Qin Yu would definitely not make a move, revealing his trump card.

As time passed by, everyone made their move and took out all sorts of treasures.

Soon, the scene quieted down. Those who should have made their move seemed to have already made their move.

Qin Yu’s gaze turned towards that young man.

The smile on that young man’s face became even wider.

It was very obvious that the treasures these people took out did not enter his eyes at all!

This immediately caused Qin Yu to have a bad premonition in his heart. He frowned and quietly looked at the young man.

Finally, the young man spoke.

He said indifferently, “As expected, a small place like the South Province doesn’t have any treasures to speak of.”

The moment these words were said, it immediately caused everyone to be dissatisfied, but at the same time, it also caused people to be shocked.

Following that, the young man’s mind moved, and he took out a colored glass that was like a teardrop.

This glass is very small, in his palm like a drop of water.

But it is such a thing, its internal Qi, but is incomparably sacred and ancient!

A true ancient treasure! That internal Qi can not deceive a person!

“What is this?”

The people at the scene are confused, can not help but look at his palm.

The young man sneered and said, “See so for myself, this is a dream glass!”

“See so for myself? What is that?”Everyone’s brows furrowed even tighter.

The young man snorted and said, “They don’t even know about it. They’re just a bunch of country bumpkins.”

“Brother, please tell us what this see so for myself is for.”The owner of the token asked anxiously.

The young man laughed coldly and said, “See so for myself? This is a true item from an ancient god. Rumor has it that it’s a tear from an ancient supreme in the galaxy!”

“Supreme cultivator? Ancient supreme cultivator?”

“That is an existence that surpasses true saints!”

“Rumor has it that the breath of an ancient supreme cultivator can destroy all living beings and make thousands of stars lose their radiance instantly. Although it is not as powerful as a cultivator at the tribulation stage, it is definitely an existence that transcends the ages!”

“A tear from him can be said to be a saint artifact!”

Qin Yu could not help but be shocked when he heard this!

This glazed dream was a magical artifact, and its power was almost no weaker than a saint artifact!

With such a treasure, he could basically run amok in the Southern Region!

“Good, good, I Want This!”The owner of the token said impatiently.

When the young man heard this, a proud smile immediately appeared on his face.

“Alright, let’s announce the results.”The young man said to the host with great confidence.

The host smiled and said, “Is there anyone else who wants to compete for this item?”

There was silence below the stage. Qin Yu sat there with his brows tightly furrowed. His face was filled with conflict.

“This is veluriyam dream. There’s no need for you to take out the scrap metal in your hands,”the young man said with a faint smile.

The host saw that no one had spoken for a long time, so he smiled and said, “Alright, then I’ll announce…”

“Wait!”

Just then, Qin Yu shouted.
