1782 The Terrifying Effect

“This way, no one can see it,” Jue Wu said.

Qin Yu could not help but feel shocked.

He did not expect Jue Wu’s spatial spell to be so brilliant.

In that case, it was much more convenient for the two of them to do things.

Therefore, Qin Yu and Jue Wu found a place to sit down for the time being and quietly observed the surrounding environment.

Jue Wu slightly closed her eyes. She released her divine sense and it quickly covered the surroundings.

In just a while, Jue Wu suddenly opened her eyes.

She looked at Qin Yu and said softly, “I’ve found Ji Si.”

“So fast?” Qin Yu said in surprise.

“What do you think? It’s a piece of cake for me!” Jue Wu proudly said.

“Then let’s go,” said Qin Yu in a deep voice.

The two of them didn’t waste time. Jue Wu led the way and went straight to Ji Si’s location.

Qin Yu was a little nervous.

He knew that once he used the Meridian Circulation Technique, he probably could not get away from Satan anymore in the future.

Although Qin Yu didn’t know what kind of organization Satan was, he could tell from their martial arts that they were by no means good.

“I wonder what effect devouring a primordial spirit will bring,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

After walking for a long time, Jue Wu stopped in front of a huge courtyard.

Jue Wu pointed at the courtyard and said, “Ji Si is inside.”

“Are there many people inside?” Qin Yu asked.

Jue Wu counted with her fingers and said, “There should be around thirty to forty of them, with two at the Reversion Void stage.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath. He patted Jue Wu’s shoulder and said, “I count on you now.”

Jue Wu didn’t say any unnecessary thing. She pulled Qin Yu and quickly rushed into the depths of the courtyard.

In the depths of the courtyard, a middle-aged man was sitting with his eyes slightly closed.

This person was none other than Ji Si.

Feeling the killing intent from Jue Wu, Ji Si suddenly opened his eyes.

When he saw Jue Wu’s face, he was a little surprised.

After the shock, a hint of greed appeared on his face.

“Such a young girl?” Ji Si licked his lips and looked at Jue Wu with a lecherous look.

Jue Wu took out the portrait and compared it with Ji Si in front of her. She then asked, “Are you Ji Si?”

Hearing this, Ji Si said proudly, “It seems you’ve heard of my name.”

“Oh, that’s good.” Jue Wu nodded.

She raised her small hand, crushed and restructured the space in front of her.

The two of them suddenly disappeared from Qin Yu’s sight as if they had entered another void.

“Bring me in too!” Qin Yu cursed in his heart.

Having said that, Qin Yu was still a little worried.

As Ji Si was at the Reversion Void Stage and was listed on the evil people list by Demon-slaying Peak, he was probably extremely powerful.

If something happened to Jue Wu, Qin Yu would probably blame himself for the rest of his life.

Just as Qin Yu was worried, a crack suddenly appeared in the void in front of him.

A figure with blood all over the body fell out.

This person was none other than Ji Si.

Ji Si was in a terrible state at this moment. His limbs were torn off and half of his head was dangling on his neck. His internal qi was extremely weak.

“This… So fast?” Qin Yu couldn’t help feeling shocked.

Soon, Jue Wu walked out.

“Alright, I’m done. I’ll leave the rest to you,” she clapped her hands and said.

Ji Si raised his trembling hand and looked at Jue Wu with fear in his eyes.

Jue Wu didn’t seem to like his gaze. So she directly stretched out two fingers and pierced his eyes.

Even Qin Yu couldn’t bear to see such a cruel scene.

“Hurry up, don’t waste time,” Jue Wu frowned and said.

“Mmm.” Qin Yu took a deep breath, raised his palm, and placed it on Ji Si’s head. He began to activate the Meridian Circulation Technique taught by Sister Ning.

The primordial spirit was dragged out of Qin Yu’s palm and then slowly entered the space between his eyebrows.

The wisps of primordial spirit quickly entered Qin Yu’s mind and merged with his primordial spirit in no time!

In his mind, Qin Yu’s primordial spirit was sitting cross-legged, emitting a ray of light.

His damaged primordial spirit was being repaired at an extremely fast speed.

In just a short while, the damaged primordial spirit had been mostly repaired!

Following that, Qin Yu’s pain was reduced.

Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes. He tried to adjust the internal qi of his body and soon found out he could now exert nearly 50% of his strength!

“How… how could it be!” Qin Yu was instantly extremely shocked!

Just by devouring a primordial spirit, he had almost recovered half of his strength. It was so unbelievable!

What was the background of Satan? How could its cultivation technique be so terrifying?

The problem that everyone was having a headache over was now solved so easily at this moment!

“How are you feeling?” Jue Wu asked anxiously.

Qin Yu swallowed his saliva and said, “I feel that at this rate, I only need to devour one more primordial spirit to fully recover…”

“So fast?” Jue Wu couldn’t help but stun.

“I didn’t expect it to be so fast either,” Qin Yu said with a frown.

He had thought that he would need to devour a large amount of primordial spirit to repair his damaged primordial spirit.

However, he didn’t expect a mere primordial spirit to have such an effect!

“If I had known this would happen, I wouldn’t even have to join Thunder Courtyard…” Qin Yu murmured.

However, before Qin Yu got excited, everything in front of him suddenly turned extremely scarlet red.

A terrifying scene was shown in front of Qin Yu!

The entire scene was scarlet red. Countless broken corpses were trembling on the ground, and countless terrifying creatures with ferocious faces were pouncing toward Qin Yu!

This scene only flashed by. Qin Yu blinked his eyes and everything in front of him disappeared.

“What… What’s going on…” Qin Yu rubbed his eyes and frowned.

Soon, Qin Yu felt that something was wrong.

There seemed to be a special emotion surging in his heart.

It was like a terrifying beast that was about to be released, filling Qin Yu’s entire brain.

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly. He could only feel that his heart was filled with killing intent and greed!

The primordial spirit that he devoured was like the best delicacy in the world, making it difficult for him to extricate himself!

“D*mn it…” Qin Yu sensed that something was wrong. He looked at Jue Wu in front of him and even thought of devouring her primordial spirit!

This thought became more and more intense, almost to the point that Qin Yu no longer could bear it!

Just then, someone rushed in from outside.

“Ji… Lord Ji Si! You… you’ve killed Lord Ji Si!” he shouted in horror.

Seeing this person, Qin Yu couldn’t hold it in any longer. He clenched his fist and instantly appeared in front of him! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Before he could react, Qin Yu slapped his head and devoured his primordial spirit straightaway.
