Chapter 2567: Martial Uncle, Are You Satisfied With This Sword?

Chen Shuang only sighed softly as he watched the clone leave. She did not do anything to stop it.

Or rather, he could not stop it at this moment. He had used the Saint’s power of origin to help Qin Yu condense the Seal of Heaven Returning.

If Zi Yang went all out, he might be able to kill his clone in this world completely.

However, as long as his divine kingdom existed, his soul would be Indestructible. That was why Zi Yang did not go all out.

Now that he saw the barrier open, he wanted to destroy all the karma in the past completely so that his dao mind would be clear and he would no longer have any distracting thoughts.

At this moment, on the battlefield.

The power of Shimoji’s eye was fully charged again, and a beam of death light shot out again.

It landed on the most intense battlefield. This was the last stronghold of the Human Race Watch.

The terrifying energy caused the space to begin disintegrating, emanating a lethal radiance that had claimed the lives of nearly 30,000 people.

As it opened its eyes, the gaze of Shimoji’s eye shone down like the light of dawn.

The power of the dark divine kingdom caused all living beings that came into contact with it to disintegrate entirely.

Even the living beings with the strongest will on the battlefield.

The individuals within the monster race watched motionless as that force overwhelmed their bodies. They lacked any will to resist, utterly unable to mount any form of resistance.

It seemed to be a force from a different dimension entirely, something beyond their capacity to contend with.

Shimoji was a Saint from one of the eighteen Kingdom of Saint.

This eye was the eye of will that he had left in this world to spread his name. The power of destruction in the pupil was the power of the divine kingdom of the distant Kingdom of Saint.

At this moment, above the dawn light, the power pierced through countless living beings.

It suddenly scattered on the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect. The power of the

Eye of Destruction intended to take advantage of the moment the barrier had just opened to exterminate the people inside completely.

Xuan Xin looked at the energy and floated up like a dragonfly skimming the water.

He was not afraid of this energy at all. Wielding the Green Duckweed Sword, he slashed into the void with a strike as simple and ancient as an elder’s sword technique.

The ultimate nothingness gave birth to the supreme ultimate, the supreme ultimate gave birth to two polarities, the two polarities gave birth to the Four Symbols, the Four Symbols gave birth to the Eight Trigrams, and the Eight Trigrams transformed into all things!

The Green Duckweed Sword in Xuan Xin’s hand stopped mid-air, and the intangible sword intent suddenly exploded throughout the entire expanse of heaven and earth.

That sword intent was like a massive rock thrown into the calmness of a lake.

It appeared everywhere without techniques and was formless.

At this moment, the immense explosive energy across the entire battlefield seemed to vanish in an instant and disintegrate into the void. Even the terrifying power of a great Godly King disappeared instantly.

The next second, Xuan Xin suddenly opened his eyes.

Two opposing Yin and Yang internal qi emanated from the Green Duckweed Sword, and a massive Tai Chi Diagram appeared out of thin air.

That power arrived upon the Taiji Diagram, like shifting stars and rotating constellations.

“Boom!”

With a massive tremor, the destructive vision of the Eye of Destruction clashed with the Tai Chi Diagram without holding back.

Like boiling water, the destructive light emitted countless bubbles.

The Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect was like the southern sky in June. Everyone felt misty before their eyes.

“He actually withstood the attack of the Eye of Destruction. Where is the guy from?”

He Teng’s face was full of disbelief. Even with the strength of his body, he dared not take an attack from the divine kingdom.

He had never thought someone from the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect could withstand such an attack. This strength could no longer be measured using the strength of the fifth level. It was already the limit of what this world could withstand.

“Senior Brother!”

“Senior Brother Xuan Xin!”

A big hole appeared in Xuan Xin’s chest. Qin Yu injected the healing power of the Heart of the Ocean into his body, but it had no effect.

There was a force that he could not stop at the wound that continued to damage his body.

“It’s fine. Senior Brother will be fine after resting for a while. I’ll do my best not to die before Sect Master and Martial Uncle determine the victor.” Xuan Xin took a deep breath, but difficult for him to take another breath.

“Stop talking.

Qin Yu gathered the energy of the Seal of Heaven Returning to his hand and slowly transferred it into Xuan Xin’s body.

He stared at the terrifying wound, hoping to use the power of the Seal of Heaven Returning to heal or delay Xuan Xin’s injury.

Otherwise, with Xuan Xin’s terrifying injuries and nearly half of his heart being pierced through, he might not be able to hold on much longer.

However, as the holy energy entered Xuan Xin’s body, even more shocking energy fluctuations erupted from his body.

It seemed that if the energy in his body were angered, his entire body would explode into a bloody mist again.

“Don’t waste your strength…’

Xuan Xin’s lips, which had lost the blood color, trembled a few times as he spat out a few words.

He looked up at a specific place and struggled to smile.

“Martial Uncle, this is the last inheritance you left for me in the human race.

Are you satisfied with this strike?”

Qin Yu raised his head and saw a black-robed young man among the countless living beings.

He seemed to be standing very far away, yet right before him.

“This sword, like the one I wielded a thousand years ago, is boundless, formless, and without attributes, not bound by yin or yang. It lacks emotions; this is the ultimate path of the Dao.”

His voice traversed space, reaching where Qin Yu and the others stood.

Xuan Xin’s body seemed to be triggered by some force. His body slowly turned into countless burning ashes, disappearing before Qin Yu.

“I’m sorry, but it wasn’t our intention to drag you into this mess. If I could, I definitely wouldn’t let you and your alliance get involved in this mess. I know what Senior Brother Xuan Tian and the other Junior Brothers and Sisters want to say. They want me to apologize to you and Human Race Watch.”

Xuan Xin struggled and stuffed the Green Duckweed Sword into Qin Yu’s hand at the last moment.

Qwas stunned, from feeling the pain of seeing the first familiar person fall to feeling numb.

With Xuan Xin’s apology at this moment, this pain surged out completely.

The young man walked toward the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect step by step.

Wherever he passed, all the living beings in the surroundings turned to ashes. A world filled with stars appeared beneath his feet.

All the stars were slowly revolving in the defined orbit. All the rules had long been defined.

It was without time, space, matter, spirit, inside or outside, big or small, boundaries, actual or unreal elements, emotions, and feelings.

Qin Yu could only understand it as “nothingness”.

We could not say “It’s here” or “It’s there”. This was Zi Yang’s Dao!

Retreat!

At this moment, even the Godly Kings and the various monster beasts were frantically leaving the vicinity of Zi Yang.

He looked at the heavily injured dean, Yan Ruoxue, and the others.

Also Chang Mang, Jue Wu, the peak master, Gu Wanqing, and the others who had already lost their vitality, tears welled up in Qin Yu’s eyes.

There were no exceptions in this imbalanced war. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

No matter how powerful a living being was, they could fall at any time. Even Xiang Yu dared not get into the center of the battlefield..
