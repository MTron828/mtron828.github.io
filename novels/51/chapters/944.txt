Chapter 945: Chapter 945, the great battle against the Martial Saint!

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “What else could it be?”

Luo Yang’s face was slightly nervous. He said with an embarrassed smile, “I just took some good tea leaves. Why Don’t you... have a taste?”

“I don’t want to drink anymore. I still have something to do.”Qin Yu waved his hand and said.

Luo Jingyu, who was standing at the side, also scolded, “Alright, Don’t waste Mr. Qin’s time.”

Luo Yang was still a little unwilling. He said with an embarrassed smile, “You should try it. I spent a lot of money to buy this tea...”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly and said, “Luo Yang, you are a little strange today.”

Luo Yang’s face instantly became even more flustered. He hurriedly waved his hand and said, “No... No, Mr. Qin, you are overthinking.”

However, Qin Yu felt that something was wrong.

This place was probably not suitable for him to stay for long.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu no longer paid attention to Luo Yang. He turned around and hurriedly walked out.

Luo Yang’s expression instantly became even more unsightly.

He had already informed Gu Xinghe. If he were to escape now, Gu Xinghe would definitely blame him for this.

“F * ck!”Luo Yang could not help but curse in his heart. He gritted his teeth and decided to secretly follow Qin Yu.

After Qin Yu walked out of the pavilion of heavenly secrets, he planned to leave as soon as possible.

He put on his hat and just as he was about to leave, Gu Xinghe and the others had already arrived not far away.

Qin Yu hurriedly tightened his hat and hastened his steps to leave.

However, at this moment, Gu Xinghe blocked Qin Yu’s way.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and pretended to be calm as he said, “What’s the matter?”

Gu xinghe laughed out loud, “Qin Yu, stop pretending. Do you think I can’t recognize you just because you’re wearing a hat?”

Before he could finish his words, the martial saint behind Gu Xinghe quickly extended his hand and sealed off this space.

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically! He took a deep breath and said, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“Oh? You still want to Pretend?”Gu Xinghe sneered.

“The Magic Artifact on your head is called thousand faces, right?”

Seeing this, Qin Yu’s face became even colder.

Obviously, it was impossible to get away with it today.

Therefore, Qin Yu simply took off his hat and looked at Gu Xinghe coldly.

“Qin Yu, I’ve been looking for you so hard,”Gu Xinghe said coldly.

Qin Yu said coldly, “Luo Yang told you, didn’t he?”

“Hehe, what does this have to do with you?”Gu Xinghe snorted.

“You won’t be able to escape today. Even the Heavenly King can’t Save You!”

Qin Yu knew that things were not going well. He could only take a deep breath and sneered, “Speaking of which, I really want to fight with the martial saint and see how powerful he is.”

“Oh? hahahahaha!”Gu Xinghe could not help but burst into laughter when he heard this.

“You are only a half-step martial saint. Do you want to kill a martial saint?”

Qin Yu sneered, “Not Necessarily.”

After this period of training with the immortal crane, although Qin Yu’s realm had not improved, his strength and speed had greatly increased.

With the help of the battle word formula, Qin Yu would not be defeated too badly even if he were to face a martial saint! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Qin Yu looked at the three people behind him and said coldly, “No need to talk nonsense. Let’s do it.”

“Uncle Zhai Xing, capture him immediately!”Gu Xinghe shouted.

However, Zhai Xing was extremely unwilling and stood there without moving an inch.

When Gu Xinghe saw this, he could not help but curse in his heart.

He could only look at the other martial saint and said, “Zeng Ji, capture him.”

“Yes, Young Master Gu.”The martial saint who was called Zeng Ji took a step forward and looked coldly at Qin Yu.

That powerful oppressive feeling immediately came pressing over.

There was a huge difference between a martial saint and a martial marquis. Just this natural oppressive feeling was unbearable.

This kind of pressure was like the suppression of the bloodline, making one’s body very uncomfortable.

Even the flow of spiritual power in the body had slowed down.

“Kid, you’ve been running for so long. It’s time for you to be punished,”Zeng Ji said coldly.

“Punished? What kind of punishment?”Qin Yu sneered.

“Stop talking nonsense with me. Just attack. Let me see how powerful a martial Saint You Are!”Qin Yu shouted.

Ceng ji narrowed his eyes and said, “Alright, then I’ll let you know what it means to be an ant if you can’t become a martial Saint!”

After he finished speaking, Ceng Ji raised his palm and pressed it towards Qin Yu!

Waves of mountain-like pressure rolled towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu did not dare to be negligent. He knew very well that he could lose his life if he was not careful when facing a martial saint.

Therefore, Qin Yu immediately released the power of the Divine Dragon, and all kinds of spells instantly erupted!

Rays of golden light spread across Qin Yu’s body, and the surging power even filled Qin Yu’s entire body!

“Ah!”

Qin Yu roared angrily and raised his hand to unleash the absolute beginning holy fist. The golden light instantly blocked everyone’s line of sight!

“Boom!”

Qin Yu’s fist collided with that gigantic palm, and instantly, an earth-shattering boom sounded out!

The surrounding people immediately looked over!

They only saw that gigantic palm actually disintegrated under Qin Yu’s fist!

This caused everyone’s eyes to widen!

One had to know that Qin Yu was facing a genuine martial saint!

Since ancient times, no martial marquis had been able to face a martial saint!

It could even be said that a martial saint killing a martial Marquis was as easy as stepping on an ant!

But now, Qin Yu’s punch had actually shattered Zeng Ji’s palm. How could anyone believe this! !

Even Zhai Xing’s eyes revealed a trace of shock!

“This kid’s talent is probably not even as good as Jiang he.”Zhai Xing thought to himself.

Zeng Ji’s face was even more ashen.

It was simply a humiliation to be shattered by a martial marquis.

“Kid, you’ve successfully angered me.”Zeng Ji said coldly with his hands behind his back.

Qin Yu grinned and said coldly, “I thought you were so amazing as a martial saint. Now, it seems that you’re just so-so.”

“You’re courting death!”

Zeng Ji was instantly furious!

His figure flashed explosively and arrived in front of Qin Yu in the blink of an eye!

Such extreme speed was even difficult to catch!

However, Qin Yu managed to dodge such a terrifying speed!

His body flashed explosively and he easily dodged Zeng Ji’s punch!

“Huh?”Zeng Ji’s brows furrowed even more!

How could this kid be so fast?

“Hahahaha!”Qin Yu could not help but burst into laughter.

“A martial saint, Huh? He’s only so-so!”

Although Zeng Ji was fast, he was nothing compared to the immortal crane!

Qin Yu could even dodge the immortal crane’s moves, let alone Zeng Ji’s!

“You’re courting death!”Zeng Ji was instantly enraged! He stepped towards Qin Yu again!
