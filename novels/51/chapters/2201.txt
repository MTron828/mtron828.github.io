2202 One Person Against a City

It stretched out, and several hundreds of cultivators stood in each formation core within tens of thousands of feet.

The magical artifacts in their hands emitted dazzling lights. Various spiritual energy surged into the formation cores, and the ancient formation activated like gears slowly rolling.

At this moment, looking down at this planet from the starry sky of the Black Platform Continent, one would find the entire galaxy as red as a sea of blood and shrill cries shuttling through the red clouds.

Terrifying pressure gathered on Qin Yu’s body. His bones creaked as if they were about to break at any moment.

Hahaha! The timing was right!

Qin Yu did not even use the desolate divine eye. With a thought, he activated the Saintly Body Technique to the extreme.

“Get lost!”

A thunderous roar echoed throughout the purgatory.

The red cloud actually dispersed. In the next moment, a scarlet eyeball opened in the middle of the sky.

The eyeball stared at Qin Yu in the middle like a god.

A beam of red light shot out from this eye. The light beam strangely did not make a sound as if it had swallowed all the sound.

“Explode!”

Qin Yu was unafraid at all. He blasted the red light beam with a punch.

“Tear!”

The black lightning exploded between the fists and the light beam, like adding water to oil.

Qin Yu spat out a mouthful of blood, and his entire body was sent flying, leaving behind a ravine several meters deep and thousands of feet away.

“Alright, let’s do it again!”

Qin Yu slammed his palm on the ground and stood up, flying toward the eye in the sky.

The red light beam shot out one after another from the eyes in the center of the formation cores. The terrifying power even blew the clouds away tens of thousands of feet from the formation.

Like a god of war, Qin Yu punched out one after another without any dodging. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

He faced the power of the entire continent single-handedly.

“Hahaha!”

Qin Yu laughed maniacally. He did not know how many attacks he had shattered, and the clothes on his body had been dyed scarlet red by the blood he spat out.

But he was unafraid at all. All that stood in his way had to give way.

“Is this f*cking human? He’s just stepped into True Saint Realm. How could he be so powerful?”

Lin Cheng’s legs trembled, and his face was ashen.

Hei Yun, Lin Tong, Fang Kai, and the others were also somewhat terrified.

“No matter what, I’ll kill you today. Otherwise, our Black Platform Continent and its aristocratic families will cease to exist!”

Lin Tong’s expression turned vicious.

“Everyone, attack with all your might!”

“Help!”

Suddenly, Wen Da’s figure appeared in Qin Yu’s divine sense.

Qin Yu was stunned, and his body was instantly sent flying.

The next moment, Yan Ruoxue’s graceful figure appeared in his mind. At this moment, Si Shiyue was getting married to her.

Qin Yu was instantly sent flying again.

He stood up. The golden light on his body dimmed, and Saintly Body Technique seemed to disintegrate at any moment.

The two terrifying attacks were equivalent to the combined attack of thousands of cultivators.

Even a peak True Saint would die instantly.

“You want to mess with me with such a Divine Sense Attack?”

From an ordinary person, he had come a long way to what he was today, and Yan Ruoxue was his unwavering determination in his heart.

He knew he was also the unwavering determination in Yan Ruoxue’s heart.

Qin Yu sneered, and the golden figurine suddenly struck out in his divine sense.

The illusions in his mind abruptly disappeared.

A scarlet light beam ten times larger than previously suddenly smashed down.

“Blood Punishment!”

Qin Yu’s figure expanded thousands of times, sensing the terrifying power.

“Cosmic form!”

He activated the Supreme Mountain of the Five Elements and pushed the cosmic form to the extreme.

He threw out the same punch.

This time, the collision was silent. All the energy seemed to have disappeared.

Qin Yu’s gigantic body was sent flying fiercely like a cannonball. If not for the formation barrier, Qin Yu probably would have been sent flying into the starry sky.

The Supreme Mountain of the Five Elements dimmed, and the cosmic form was about to disintegrate.

Qin Yu struggled to stand up.

Was this the power that killed a cultivator at the half-step Tribulation Transcendence Stage?

It was still insufficient.

Qin Yu clenched his fists and muttered.

In the Holy Region, Qin Yu had always been standing behind Yan Ruoxue.

It included Xiao Sheng and Xiao Hai, the two brothers, and Dean Lei. They had always shielded him.

In the end, when he retreated from the Holy Region, he was still protected by someone.

At this moment, he could no longer retreat.

“So what if you’re a cultivator from the Holy Region? You’ll still die here. After you die, I’ll hang your corpse on the city wall to let people know the consequences of going against my Black Platform Continent!”

Lin Tong laughed maniacally.

“Let’s attack together and kill this madman!”

He picked up a magical artifact and activated it with all his might. It was a tribulation magical artifact.

“Blood Punishment!”

All the power suddenly started to roll and gather in front of his eyes.

A blood-red sphere slowly expanded before him, and terrifying energy gathered from all directions.

At this moment, the area within tens of thousands of feet started to shake like an earthquake.

The ball of blood instantly grew to a size of several hundred feet. Countless energy gathered within, trying to struggle free, but were firmly sucked in.

A gigantic dragon shadow circled the blood ball. Then, phantoms of various powerful Demonic Beasts appeared.

“Even a Tribulation Transcending cultivator will die! He would die in the Purgatory Formation and become the guardian of the formation for the rest of his life!”

Hei Yun said coldly. His tribulation magical artifact became almost transparent, and its energy seemed to have been sucked dry by the formation.

The eye in the middle of the formation suddenly opened, and the blood ball several thousands of feet smashed toward Qin Yu like a meteorite.

Space was torn apart, and thunder and lightning raged in all directions.

It was tremendously difficult for Qin Yu to even move at this moment.

Was this the power of the Tribulation Stage?

The power of the Blood Punishment shocked him. The clothes on his body shook frantically as if sensing the danger.

“Senior Wu Ji.”

Qin Yu suddenly closed his eyes and recalled his cultivation in the void.

He fought against Wu Ji in the heavenly tribulation.

So what if the dao technique of heaven and earth retreated? Wu Ji remained invincible.

He would slay the immortal if an immortal was before him. He would behead the demon if a demon was before him.

So what if it was a strike of tribulation?

The cosmic form of Qin Yu’s body dissolved, and the Saintly Body Technique dissolved. He stretched out his fist.

A pale white phantom spread out with Qin Yu’s fist as the center.

In the blink of an eye, it enveloped the entire formation.

Like a newly established world, countless green trees suddenly formed a shade.

New life emerged from the earth, with creatures taking flight and animals roaming while birds filled the air with melodious songs.

The sea of blood instantly turned into a peach garden, and various powerful internal qi continuously appeared.

The internal qi grew from weak to strong and was even stronger than True Saint.

After that, everything was destroyed. All living beings, the new world, and even the space were destroyed.

“Senior Wu Ji, I’ll call this technique Traceless Annihilation.”

Qin Yu said indifferently. At this moment, the Traceless Immortal Scripture had completely integrated into his body.

He seemed to have comprehended the true core of the Traceless Immortal Scripture at this moment of life and death.

It was invincibility, fearlessness, and destruction.

Everything that stood in my way was to make me grow stronger.

All the obstacles were crushed. It was invincible, and it was Wu Ji.

Even the Path of Heaven could not change Wu Ji’s path.
