Chapter 831: The Method to Open the Mystic Realm

The man with the mustache on the other end said, “The corpses of the Immortal Slaying Sect seem to have been resurrected.”

Qin Yu’s eyelids twitched!

“The corpses of the Immortal Slaying Sect have been resurrected? Haven’t those corpses already turned into ashes?” Qin Yu hurriedly asked.

The man with the mustache grunted and continued, “I suspect that these corpses came from the underground of the Immortal Slaying Sect.”

“In other words, what we saw was the surface of the Immortal Slaying Sect, while the real corpses were buried underground.”

This made Qin Yu feel a strong sense of danger!

The corpses of the Immortal Slaying Sect were all at the level of the Mighty Realm!

If someone could resurrect the corpses of the Immortal Slaying Sect, then no one would be able to stop them!

“I’ll tell you when I get back,” said the man with the mustache.

“Okay,” Qin Yu agreed and hung up the phone.

He stood there and thought for a moment, then said in a low voice, “Forget it. Even if they are really resurrected, the one to worry is the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

Moreover, there was a mysterious guardian.

The next day.

Qin Yu went to the dungeon again and found Zheng Ke.

In a short night, Zheng Ke seemed to have changed into a different person, as if he had aged dozens of years.

Once a person lost hope, he would lose all his energy and spirit.

“How is it? Have you thought it through?” Qin Yu said indifferently.

Zheng Ke hurriedly raised his head to look at Qin Yu and said, “You will really let me go, right?”

“Absolutely,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

Zheng Ke gritted his teeth. He took out the token from his pocket and handed it to Qin Yu.

“What exactly is this token?” Qin Yu sized up the token in his hand. He couldn’t help but have some doubts.

Zheng Ke said, “This token is used to explore Mystic Realm Daoist techniques.”

“Mystic Realm Daoist techniques?” Qin Yu gestured for Zheng Ke to continue.

“Mystic Realms are small worlds created by Mighty Realm powerhouses, but their essence still depends on this world.”

“To put it bluntly, what they rely on is to create a new path in their Dao Techniques to open up another world.”

Qin Yu touched his chin and said, “In other words, this Mystic Realm is actually woven from complex Dao Techniques?”

“Smart.” Zheng Ke nodded.

“This token is to understand this complex Dao Technique.”

“As long as we understand the Dao Technique, we can use the Dao Technique to find a way to open it.”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Then don’t waste time. Teach me quickly.”

Zheng Ke shook his head and said, “There are thousands of Dao Techniques, and the Dao Techniques used to create the Mystic Realm are naturally countless and extremely complicated.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“It’s impossible for you to learn it in a short time.”

“To put it bluntly, the method we use is to open the Mystic Realm in different ways. You have to learn the ways one by one, use the token to find the Dao Techniques, and then use the corresponding ways to open the Mystic Realm.”

“We have a professional term for this way, and it’s called the secret key.”

Although Zheng Ke’s description wasn’t clear, Qin Yu still understood the general idea.

Just like the key to the door, one had to find the Dao Technique to set up the Mystic Realm, and use the key to open it.

“How many secret keys are there?” Qin Yu asked.

Zheng Ke said, “Countless. I control about 3,600 kinds.”

“It is said that the most powerful Mystic Realm master in the world controls 108,000 types.”

“The gap is so big?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

These words made Zheng Ke extremely unhappy.

He snorted coldly and said, “Don’t underestimate these 3,600 types. These 3,600 types are enough to deal with most Mystic Realms.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Then how long have you studied?”

Zheng Ke stretched out three fingers and said, “A whole 30 years.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but gasp.

“It takes 30 years to master 3,600 types?” Qin Yu’s face was full of shock.

Zheng Ke nodded and said, “That’s right. Learning the secret key cannot be accomplished overnight. It’s a slow process.”

“Learn one secret key today, and learn five tomorrow. Slowly stack them up.”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes. He looked at Zheng Ke suspiciously and said, “Are you deliberately stalling for time in order to survive?”

Zheng Ke was stunned for a moment, then he snorted and said, “There is indeed such a reason, but even if you have extraordinary talent, you will need at least five or even ten years to learn it.”

“I don’t have that much time. Is there any rough way to directly open the Mystic Realm?” Qin Yu asked.

Zheng Ke shook his head and said, “No, I said that I can only use the token to find the secret key corresponding to the Daoist technique and then use the secret key to open the Mystic Realm.”

“This so-called secret key is just a string of spells, right?” Qin Yu asked.

“That’s right.” Zheng Ke nodded.

“Of course, if you are strong enough, you can naturally use brute force to break open the Mystic Realm,” Zheng Ke said with a faint smile.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Don’t say that kind of nonsense.”

He sized up Zheng Ke and said, “That means I have to take you with me and slowly learn your secret key, right?”

“Yes.” Zheng Ke nodded.

Qin Yu glanced at Zheng Ke. This kid didn’t seem to be lying.

In this case, it wouldn’t be so easy for Qin Yu to kill Zheng Ke.

Qin Yu couldn’t afford to waste five years to learn the secret key.

“It seems that I can only keep you by my side,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu raised his finger and placed a mark between Zheng Ke’s eyebrows.

“Let me tell you, I can spare your life, but you must work for me,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Okay!” Zheng Ke agreed without thinking.

“If you dare to betray me, I will destroy you.”

Zheng Ke said sarcastically, “I’m afraid I can’t return to the Hong family now.”

Qin Yu didn’t say any more nonsense. He pulled Zheng Ke out of the dungeon.

“Go and wash yourself. Come with me to Qing City later,” Qin Yu said.

After Zheng Ke took a shower, Qin Yu prepared another set of clothes for him.

After all the preparations were done, Qin Yu said goodbye to the Pavilion Master, then took Zheng Ke and headed straight to Qing City.

After a few trips, Qin Yu and Zheng Ke finally arrived at Qing City.

“You’re looking for the Mystic Realm of the Hong Yi Sect, right?” Zheng Ke asked.

Qin Yu nodded and sneered. “The Hong Yi Sect has bullied me repeatedly. Now, they’re actually scheming against my wife. Do they really think I’m a pushover?”

Zheng Ke didn’t say anything. He leaned against the car and closed his eyes slightly.

They arrived at the vicinity of the Mystic Realm.

The moment the two of them got off the car, Qin Yu met a familiar person.

This person was none other than Su Qian, who had invited him previously.

“Qin Yu?” Upon seeing Qin Yu, Su Qian took the initiative to come up and greet him.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and suddenly reached out his hand, grabbing Su Qian’s fair neck!
