Chapter 568: Your Golden Core Belongs to Me Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

After the phone call, Qin Yu couldn’t help but want to laugh.

These capitalists always wanted to be above others and turn everyone into their tools.

For Qin Yu, this was absolutely unacceptable. Gu Canghai was a good example.

Then, Qin Yu picked up his phone and called Yao Qing.

After the call was connected, Qin Yu said, “Yao Qing, you and Taozi will set off tomorrow. Come to Cangzao City.”

“Qin Yu, I’ve finally found you...”

However, a gloomy voice came from the other end.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. “Who are you?”

“Me? Someone paid me to kill you, but I couldn’t find you, so I could only come to your house and wait for you,” the other party said nonchalantly.

“Oh, let me introduce myself. You should have heard of my name. I’m Ma Hai.”

Qin Yu said coldly, “Ma Hai? Who are you?”

On the other end, Ma Hai was stunned. Then, he couldn’t help but sneer. “You actually haven’t heard of my name? It seems that you aren’t that enlightened...”

“What did you do to Yao Qing and Taozi?” Qin Yu didn’t have the mood to listen to his nonsense.

Ma Hai said indifferently, “If you came back early enough, they won’t be dead. But if you continue to hide, it’s hard to say...”

“Okay, wait for me in Chuzhou. I’ll go back immediately,” Qin Yu said coldly.

After hanging up the phone, Qin Yu turned his head and left the Green Moon Villa before heading straight for Chuzhou.

...

Chuzhou.

Ma Hai sat cross-legged in the courtyard.

He held a small teapot in his hand and sipped it from time to time.

This teapot not only held water, but it was also an extraordinary Magic Artifact!

It was said that this Magic Artifact was snatched from the hands of a Martial Marquis, and contained a trace of the power of nature.

Using the power of nature to brew tea was enough to show how extravagant Ma Hai was.

“As long as you’re obedient, I won’t kill you guys.” Ma Hai glanced at Yao Qing and Taozi, who were lying on the ground, and said indifferently.

Taozi’s face was full of tears and her delicate body trembled slightly.

Yao Qing clenched his fists and was extremely angry!

Ma Hai was extremely vicious. He left a scar on Taozi’s delicate face and a scar in Yao Qing’s dantian!

Looking at the two people’s pained expressions, Ma Hai seemed to enjoy it.

“Bro, I’ve come to look for you again.” At this moment, a figure suddenly appeared at the door.

This person was none other than the man with the mustache.

The moment the man with the mustache entered the door, he saw the scene in front of him.

He coughed dryly and said with an embarrassed smile, “Sorry, I’ve come to the wrong door.”

After saying this, the man with the mustache turned around and was about to run away.

Ma Hai’s expression turned cold, and he snorted lightly. “Since you’re here, then come and accompany them.”

As he spoke, Ma Hai raised his finger and pointed forward.

In an instant, a terrifying force rippled out like water ripples.

Then, a powerful killing force rushed straight at the man with the mustache!

“I’ll go!” The man with the mustache trembled and then ran away.

In the blink of an eye, the man with the mustache disappeared without a trace.

This made Ma Hai frown slightly.

“What a fast speed,” Ma Hai said in a low voice.

Although it was only a casual attack, it was from an old Martial Marquis.

Since it was dodged so easily, Ma Hai couldn’t help but feel suspicious.

“Who was that person just now?” Ma Hai glanced at Yao Qing and asked.

Yao Qing gritted his teeth and said, “Your father!”

Ma Hai wasn’t angry. He smiled nonchalantly and said, “You’re not that strong, but you have quite a tempter. Aren’t you afraid that I will kill you?”

“If you kill me, Mr. Qin will definitely kill you!” Yao Qing roared angrily.

Ma Hai laughed loudly and said, “When I was making a name for myself in the world, Qin Yu was probably not even born yet.”

“Old fart, stop bragging. Don’t think that I don’t know that you’re someone else’s lap dog!” Yao Qing cursed.

Ma Hai narrowed his eyes and said sinisterly, “Looks like you’re really not afraid of death. Alright, then I will satisfy you!”

After saying that, Ma Hai raised his finger, and a terrifying force gathered on his finger.

“Crack!”

Ma Hai pointed his finger forward lightly, and a sharp ray of light headed straight for Yao Qing’s glabella!

At this critical moment, a thumb ring shot out from not far away!

“Clang!”

This thumb ring happened to block in front of Yao Qing’s glabella!

Ma Hai frowned slightly. He was about to say something when he saw the man with the mustache standing at the door with a wretched look on his face.

“Bro, you don’t want to kill people,” the man with the mustache said with an embarrassed smile.

Ma Hai’s expression was cold. He narrowed his eyes and said, “I let you escape just now, yet you still dare to meddle in other people’s business? I think you’re courting death!”

After saying that, Ma Hai waved his big palm, and a terrifying qi force rushed toward the man with the mustache!

The man with the mustache’s expression changed. He hurriedly took out his Magic Artifact and threw it at Ma Hai.

“Clang!”

Ma Hai’s spell was canceled out again!

And the man with the mustache’s Magic Artifact also shattered.

“Oh no. I threw the wrong thing. This Magic Artifact is my most beloved thing. I can’t throw it away!” The man with the mustache said with a pained expression.

Ma Hai’s expression became even colder. He slowly stood up and said with narrowed eyes, “Kid, you’ve completely infuriated me.”

The man with the mustache said fawningly, “Bro, don’t be anxious. We can sit down and chat. How about... we find a place to have a drink? It’s your treat!”

“F * ck you!” Ma Hai was thoroughly enraged!

He raised his palm, and countless spells instantly pressed down on him in all directions!

The man with the mustache shivered as he continued to take out Magic Artifacts from his Spatial Magic Artifact and throw them over.

In an instant, copper pots, rings, and jade stones flew all over the sky.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

One after another, the Magic Artifacts exploded in the air. The man with the mustache felt his heart ache as he looked at them.

“F * ck, these Magic Artifacts are my treasures!” The man with the mustache looked like he wanted to cry.

Meanwhile, Ma Hai’s expression became even gloomier.

How could he not be angry when he couldn’t take down a random guy even after a long time?!

“Bro, let’s stop here. If I continue to throw things, my decades worth of collections will be gone!” The man with the mustache kept waving his hand. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Ma Hai was getting angrier and angrier!

This kid in front of him clearly seemed to be toying with him!

A murderous aura burst out from Ma Hai’s body.

He took a deep breath and said, “I don’t care who you’re. Today, I will definitely kill you!”

“That depends on whether you have the ability or not!”

At this moment, a cold voice came from the distance, followed by a golden light coming straight at his face!

Ma Hai didn’t dare to be negligent. His feet shook and he immediately dodged to the side!

“Qin Yu, you’re finally back,” the man with the mustache said hurriedly.

“This old b*stard broke more than ten of my Magic Artifacts. You have to pay me back!” The man with the mustache said seriously.

Qin Yu didn’t pay attention to the man with the mustache. He glanced at Yao Qing and Taozi and said coldly, “Your Golden Core belongs to me.”
