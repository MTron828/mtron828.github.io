“It’s not the saber qi. That saber just sliced through my throat directly. It seemed suddenly extended from the void. I had no way to guard against it at all. ”

Qin Yu stared intensely in a specific direction. His Nine Heavens

Manifestations Gaze had sensed the fluctuation from there just now. Yin Lin should be hiding there.

“What the hell is that?”

Yin Lin did not notice holy energy entering his body. However, he sensed danger instantly.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s body seemed to be enveloped in red gas, and wearing a tall green hat on his head.

Three seconds later, Qin Yu could finally move.

However, the surface of his skin resembled a burnt piece of meat, scalding hot to the touch.

He suddenly grabbed the bow hanging on his back and shot out two arrows consecutively with 30% of his strength, forcing Yin Lin out.

He did not even see how his last slash attacked the other party. He definitely could not give Yin Lin another chance to attack.

‘Whoosh!”

A disheveled figure rolled out of the ruins and forcefully retreated.

The squirming floor and walls beneath him slowly faded.

‘Quickly stop him!”

Yin Lin roared.

Qin Yu closed his eyes. The Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze had already completely locked onto Yin Lin. No matter how fast he was, he could not escape the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze.

“Whoosh!”

He pulled the bowstring to the extreme and shot an arrow.

“Boom!”

Yin Lin’s body exploded and soon turned into a pile of fragments in black. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Qin Yu did not stop and approached him at the fastest speed.

His Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze stared intently. As expected, it was another clone. It seemed to be the innate divine ability of their race.

Within this distance of 20 meters, Qin Yu had already run more than 300 meters in a short time.

Along the way, there were three places where energy fluctuations appeared. He shot an arrow at all of them.

There was nothing unusual in the ruins.

Qin Yu accelerated and dashed forward once again. The second clone’s strength was clearly much weaker than the first.

Furthermore, he was using the necromancy technique. Now was the best time to kill Yin Lin. Otherwise, with such a demon race watching him covetously, it would bring him great trouble.

Moreover, when he first fought against the demonic beasts at the west gate, his true body should have been on the city wall. Therefore, he should not have been able to escape.

He bet that the true body was not too far away from the clone, and the true body should be tremendously weak now.

Finally, when Qin Yu used 30% of his strength to shoot three more arrows, a figure rolled out of the ruins in a sorry state.

Yin Lin shouted, his face ashen.

“My mother is Emerald Serpent Witch. She won’t let you off if you kill me! Do you want to be enemies with a Saint?” Yin Lin cried out in anguish.

“Crack! ”

Qin Yu broke his neck straight away, and a vast amount of the soul’s Saint Power was injected into his body.

This power far surpassed the soul’s Saint Power of two Hua Qianjie.

Only then did his body relax.

He had already shot six arrows consecutively just now, and he had been running at extreme speed.

He had nearly exhausted his physical strength. In the end, he relied on his strong willpower to support himself. Fortunately, he found traces of Yin Lin in the end.

Moreover, a skeletal hand was on the ground, and a crystal ball.

“Hahaha, quickly pick it up. This demon race kid actually has two orders of the Saint Kingdom. Good heavens! Emerald Serpent Witch is indeed going all out for her son to take over this Saint Kingdom. I didn’t expect you to benefit from it.”

Immortal Emperor Yao laughed heartily.

Qin Yu picked up the two orders and strengthened his feet with one-third of the Saint Power.

Instantly, his speed increased significantly, and he captured the remaining seven people of the demon race.

“Kill them.”

Qin Yu threw the seven of them beside Shen Qian.

Although these people did not have as much Saint Power as Yin Lin, their power could not be underestimated as people chosen by the Emerald Serpent Witch.

“Thank you, Brother Qin Yu.”

Shen Qian directly killed all seven of them.

Right now, the soul’s Saint Power of these seven people was nothing to Qin Yu, but it was essential to her.

This Saint Power was equivalent to three times her soul’s Saint Power, which was enough to increase her self-protection ability.

Moreover, judging from the current situation, she did not come here with extreme power, so her danger would not be as high as Qin Yu.

Qin Yu casually found a seat and sat down. This was the first time he had come into contact with the Order of Saint Kingdom.

He wanted to study it thoroughly before the second battle began. He placed the bone claw in his palm.

“Immortal Emperor Yao, I took over this bone claw’s Order of Saint Kingdom.

Qin Yu frowned and asked but did not receive any response.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly. After Immortal Emperor Yao arrived in Saint Kingdom, he came and went off unpredictably. Whenever something caught his interest, he would speak a few words and disappear without a trace.

Qin Yu carefully sensed the power of this bone claw. Compared to last time, the bone claw this time, Qin Yu only felt a pure aura of the way. It did not have the cold curse power that he had sensed before.

It should not be a problem.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly and crushed the pale bone claw.

An invisible force instantly rushed into Qin Yu’s soul, and massive information appeared in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

He moved both hands, and the Order of Necromancy in his soul began to tremble.

After that, his soul power uncontrollably sank into this rule, and the surrounding walls began to twist and warp like before.

The ogre’s esophagus?

It was a strange name.

With a thought, Yin Lin and the corpses of the demon race under his command entered this esophagus.

Following Qin Yu’s other thought, their rotting corpses were summoned from within.

This way was directly related to the power of the soul. At this moment, he could only summon at most ten corpses that had been eaten.

If used properly, this thing could have an unexpected effect.

The other power of the way reflected. After absorbing it and fumbling for a while, Qin Yu finally figured it out.

It used the coordinates of the Saint Kingdom as a pivot point to project the attacks around him to another location.

However, as the distance increased, the amount of soul power consumed also increased.

“Hiss!”

Qin Yu gasped. So this was what had just attacked him.

Even at this moment, Qin Yu still felt lingering fear. This feeling of having his throat slit was something he could not forget.

Without the green hat, he would have been killed by this move.

He picked up Yin Lin’s Vajra Saber and squinted slightly as he activated the Order of Reflection.

The red line extended from his position and refracted into the void.

A red dot moved slowly. With a slight movement, the final red dot would deviate significantly. Qin Yu only drew his saber after aiming for a long time.

“Whoosh!”

Sixty meters away, a branch suddenly fell.

He had to familiarize himself with this thing thoroughly. Once he was familiar with the point of reflection, it would be difficult for the enemy to react in time if he suddenly attacked.

Even with the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze, his throat was completely slit..
