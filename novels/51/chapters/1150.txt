Chapter 1151: Chapter 1,151: Kneel and beg for mercy 

The ground was in ruins, and Qin Yu’s body was crushed by the huge seal until his bones were broken, dripping with blood.

Gu Xinghe put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Qin Yu, I’m really happy to see you like this.”

Qin Yu didn’t say a word. He used his hands to support the ground and struggled to get up.

“Oh? You can still stand up?”Gu Xinghe was a little surprised.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. His palm shook and he took out the bronze sword.

At this moment, the bronze sword seemed to merge with Qin Yu and slowly turned into a golden light.

The blade of the sword hummed. If one listened carefully, one could even hear a faint dragon’s roar.

Qin Yu was out of breath. He held the bronze sword with both of his arms and poured spiritual energy into it.

On the blade of the bronze sword, strands of sword light burst out. The sword light was like smoke, lingering on the blade and spreading in all directions.

“Divine rank nine slash, fifth slash!”Qin Yu grabbed the blade with both of his arms, ready to activate the divine rank sword technique!

“Gu Xinghe!”

However, at this moment, a blood-red light streaked across the sky, and a fist the size of a casserole instantly arrived in front of Gu Xinghe!

Gu Xinghe did not notice the Madman Chang Mang at all. This punch landed squarely on his face!

“Whoosh!”

Gu Xinghe streaked across the sky in a parabola, and then ruthlessly sank into the ground!

“Boom!”

That piece of ground seemed to have been bombarded, and turned into a pile of ruins!

Chang Mang’s entire body was emitting a blood-red ray of light, and he roared furiously. His fists were like raindrops, smashing towards the huge pit!

One punch, two punches, three punches...

His speed was extremely fast, and in the blink of an eye, he had already thrown out hundreds of punches!

The entire area was smashed into smithereens, and all the crushed stones were shattered into powder!

Chang Mang became more and more courageous as he fought, and like a madman, his fists rained down on the pit.

The void shattered and closed, closing and shattering. The surrounding people were dumbstruck as they looked at each other.

No one had expected that Chang Mang, who was like a madman, would suddenly appear!

“Enough!”

At this moment, a ray of light shot out from the huge pit and directly sent Chang Mang flying!

Gu Xinghe followed the ray of light out. His entire body was covered in blood, and his expression was extremely gloomy. A terrifying killing intent lingered around his body.

“You Reckless Bastard...”Gu Xinghe gritted his teeth and glared at Chang Mang.

However, Chang Mang didn’t care about this. He roared and rushed over again.

This time, Gu Xinghe didn’t give him another chance. His palm stretched out like a claw and grabbed Chang Mang’s neck. The strength of his hand also increased rapidly!

“Gu Xinghe, Stop!”Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically when he saw this!

Gu Xinghe looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Since someone is eager to die, I’ll give him ten percent first!”

The current Gu Xinghe had the power of eight mighty figures, after all. His strength was not something Chang Mang could compare to.

Even though Chang Mang struggled with all his might, it was useless.

Qin Yu knew that Gu Xinghe would not let Chang Mang off, so he did not waste any more words. He grabbed the bronze sword and raised his hand to unleash the fifth slash of the nine absolute beginning slashes!

This was a true heaven rank sword technique with unparalleled power. The Mighty Sword Ray left many marks in the void, splitting it in half!

Gu Xinghe’s expression changed slightly. He did not dare to be negligent and hurriedly let go of Chang Mang. Then, he held the mark in his hand and faced the sword.

“Boom!”

The sword ray slashed past Gu Xinghe’s palm, shattering the mark in his hand!

However, Gu Xinghe had the strength of a mighty figure after all. Even if the mark was shattered, he did not panic at all.

Gu Xinghe grabbed it with one hand and then suddenly slashed forward.

“Chi la!”

The void in front of him was actually shattered! The Sword Ray entered the void and disappeared without a trace!

Such a technique could not help but make people despair!

Gu Xinghe actually directly tore apart the void!

Although this was only the void of the second secret realm, it was still shocking!

Gu Xinghe sneered, “Qin Yu, the current me, even if you go all out, you can’t Win Against Me!”

Qin Yu’s internal Qi had already begun to disappear. His previously vigorous aura had now become dispirited.

Gu Xinghe’s feet lightly shook, and in the blink of an eye, he arrived in front of Qin Yu.

“How is it? Is this feeling of despair comfortable?”Gu Xinghe asked indifferently.

Qin Yu coldly looked at Gu Xinghe and said, “This is definitely not your strength...”

“So what if it is, so what if it isn’t?”Gu Xinghe sneered.

He suddenly stretched out his left hand and grabbed Qin Yu’s head!

A force gathered in his palm.

“Ah! !”

Qin Yu felt as if his head was about to be crushed. The pain was unbearable!

“Xinghe, Stop!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

At this moment, a familiar voice suddenly entered Gu Xinghe’s ears.

He turned around and saw that it was Zhai Xing!

At this moment, Zhai Xing’s expression was extremely complicated. He looked at Gu Xinghe in front of him and said in a trembling voice, “Xinghe, you... Let Him Go!”

Gu Xinghe raised his brows and sneered, “Uncle Zhai Xing? Long time no see.”

Zhai Xing lowered his head and said, “I didn’t protect your father well. I... I apologize to you.”

Gu Xinghe’s expression turned cold and he snorted, “Didn’t protect my father well? Then why didn’t you avenge my father? Why didn’t you follow my father?”

“I. . .”Zhai Xing opened his mouth and was immediately speechless.

“Why? Are You Qin Yu’s Lackey Now?”Gu Xinghe sneered.

Zhai Xing opened his mouth and didn’t know how to explain himself.

“Xinghe, if you still recognize me as your uncle, then release Qin Yu. The person who killed your father wasn’t him,”Zhai Xing suddenly raised his head and said in a trembling voice.

Gu Xinghe couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

He looked at Zhai Xing with some amusement and said, “Alright, if you want me to release him, then you can kneel down and beg me.”

Zhai Xing was stunned, and a trace of bitterness flashed across his face.

For more than a hundred years, he had never knelt down to anyone.

He had watched Gu Xinghe grow up with his own eyes, but now, he was asked to kneel down. The feeling was indescribable.

“I want you to kneel down!”Gu Xinghe exerted force again!

“Okay, i... I’ll kneel!”Zhai Xing gritted his teeth, and then with a plop, he knelt on the ground.

“Hahahahaha!”Seeing this scene, Gu Xinghe could not help but laugh out loud.

He threw Qin Yu down and then reached out his hand to grab Zhai Xing.

“Do you think that I will let him go just because you knelt down? What a joke!”Gu Xinghe said coldly.

“Let me tell you, I will kill all of you and then re-establish the martial arts association of Jingdu and become the true controller of the Martial Arts Association of Jingdu!”
