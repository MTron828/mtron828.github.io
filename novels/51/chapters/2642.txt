Chapter 2643: Retreat

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Wu Tian could easily obliterate this power.

It indicated that Wu Tian’s strength was far beyond what he could imagine.

“Use the power of Saint Kingdom to baptize me and break the shackles on my body. In return, I will help you ascend to the position of the Lord of this Saint Kingdom. Don’t doubt me, my strength is no longer something that this mere Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom can limit.”

Wu Tian smiled. At his peak, he had shaken the three realms.

Even in the three realms, no one dared to face him in the Three Realms (similar to purgatory, ghost realm, monster realm, and other low-dimensional places), the Mortal Realm, and the Saint Kingdom. He was just one step away from condensing a divinity and breaking through to the Divine Realm.

If he had not been plotted against by the Buddhist Sect in the end, splitting his body into five parts and suppressing them in five different divine kingdoms, he would have completely disappeared from that era.

After a long time, the changes in this Saint Kingdom finally gave way to the suppressed Wu Tian, restoring some distant consciousness.

What was sealed here was his arm. After being sealed for so long, his body had already been corroded by the power of Saint Kingdom, causing a portion of his body to become that of a native. His arm was suppressed by the strictest Order of Saint Kingdom, and his strength had fallen to a terrifying level.

“Wu Tian, I, Qin Yu, have never needed anyone’s help to reach the top. You can wait and find a suitable candidate.”

Qin Yu smiled coldly. If Wu Tian had been stronger, he might have been more frightened.

However, Wu Tian had been so easygoing since the beginning.

This meant that the power of Saint Kingdom was still somewhat effective against him. At the very least, it could protect his safety.

“That’s a pity.”

Wu Tian shook his head.

Qin Yu grabbed the two people on the ground and slowly retreated.

He stared at Wu Tian warily. Once Wu Tian attacked, he would use all the power of Saint Kingdom he could muster. He would make Wu Tian pay even if it meant risking his life.

Facing this old fellow who had lived for so long, Qin Yu did not dare to relax in the slightest.

However, to his surprise, Wu Tian only looked at them with a sneer, as if he did not care.

After the three of them left, Immortal Emperor Yao exclaimed in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

“With my understanding of this little fellow, he didn’t have any killing intent.

Seems like, after such a long time, his body has already been invaded by the

Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom. That’s why he’s so afraid of your power of Saint Kingdom.”

“Immortal Emperor Yao, what is the difference between the natives and Wu Tian and Pang De?”

Qin Yu was puzzled. The natives should be living beings derived from this Saint Kingdom, which was understandable. But Wu Tian and the others should belong to outsiders, so why would they be so fearful of the power of the Saint Kingdom? This was something Qin Yu couldn’t quite grasp.

“The power of the eighteen Saint Kingdoms is a huge source of power for the natives. For outsiders, it’s a massive energy supplement in the short term. But unless you’re willing to gradually become part of the Saint Kingdom, that is, become a native, your power and soul will be eroded by the power of the Saint Kingdom, ultimately being subject to the strong restrictions of this world.

That’s also why other Holy Lords dare not easily invade other Saint Kingdoms.”

Immortal Emperor Yao said with a smile.

“The stronger one’s strength, the more severe the suppression and assimilation. That’s why Wu Tian was suppressed in different Saint Kingdoms. Over the long years, a large portion of his arm has already been assimilated by the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom. That’s why he’s so afraid of your power of Saint kingdom.”

“What?”

Qin Yu was taken aback. He didn’t expect the power of Saint Kingdom to be so terrifying.

So, unless one was willing to live within the Saint Kingdom, they could only become a part of it, unless they aspired to become a Holy Lord.

“Hahaha, no matter how elusive the hope is, many geniuses will fight to the death for it, experiencing the terrifying power of a sixth-level Saint-level expert. If it were you, would you be willing to return to a lower level to comprehend the power at the end of the rules? Moreover, if one becomes strong enough, they could use their strength to break through the crystal walls of the Saint Kingdom and travel between the two worlds! They wouldn’t be suppressed by the Saint Kingdom at all.”

“Is that possible?” Qin Yu was astonished.

The Order of Saint Kingdom had a strong suppression of the natives, which could be seen from the fact that even the powerful Wu Tian dared not attack him.

To be able to use his strength to resist the suppression of the Order of Saint Kingdom, what kind of terrifying power was this?

“In the long years after my death, I saw someone who could do it. You should have heard of this person.”

“Who is it?” Qin Yu asked curiously.

“Wu Ji. During the Primordial Chaos era, when the Path of Heaven was divided, the Supreme of the Divine Land, in the Era of Annihilation, this person was born. However, he broke through the crystal wall between the Mortal Realm and the Saint Kingdom with his strength. He fought against the eighteen Holy Lords one by one in the eighteen Holy Kingdoms and remained undefeated. Finally, he entered the Divine Realm with an invincible posture. It’s a pity for such a genius that there are no opponents who can match him in this era. If it were in my ear, I would have a good fight with him.”

Immortal Emperor Yao sighed.

Qin Yu’s head rumbled. He had always known about Senior Wu Ji’s elegant demeanor from the oral accounts of others.

Now that he heard this from a former Imperial Immortal, the shock was even more apparent.

“And in the vast universe, there might be such people, but we don’t know. Isn’t this the most fascinating thing in the world of cultivation? Hahahaha, everyone will meet someone stronger than them.”

Immortal Emperor Yao laughed.

“Senior Wu Ji, you’re a fierce person.”

Qin Yu laughed bitterly. Even though he had obtained the inheritance of Wu Ji, he could only look up to it.

However, he quickly retracted his thoughts.

The oppressive atmosphere in the Ancient Demon Land was swept away, but they had to retreat now.

He had more important things to do, which was to consider his next move.

He didn’t know if it was a deliberate arrangement or a coincidence.

Coincidentally, there appeared a True Consciousness owner of the Heart of Saint Kingdom, transferring the power of the Saint Kingdom in this region to the Zi Yang Saint Kingdom, causing a decrease in the suppression of order here.

The natives here could already kill outsiders without fear, so he was thinking about how to survive this situation and break through the third test.

The Demon Sealing Valley and the Ancient Demon Land were killing outsiders wantonly to obtain the Heart of Saint Kingdom.

With his current strength, it was extremely unrealistic for him to fight against both sides at the same time. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Even just now, he could sense that Wu Tian did not fear him, but he did not care..
