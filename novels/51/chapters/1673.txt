Looking at Qin Yu who had gone deep into the dragon burial cave, Zhuo Jing wanted to get up and follow him, but the injuries on his body made it extremely difficult for him to move. In the end, he chose to stay here and wait for Qin Yu.

He looked outside the dragon burial cave with a trace of worry in his eyes.

The strength of those insects was not something that the two of them could resist. They did not even know where these insects came from.

If they stayed in such a place without any spiritual Qi for a long time, they would die of weakness sooner or later.

“Sigh.”Zhuo Jing let out a long sigh. He looked into the depths of the dragon burial cave and said in a low voice, “I hope Qin Yu can find a way...”

There was a long path in the dragon burial cave. On the way, Qin Yu walked very quickly.

This was confidence in his own judgment, and he was not afraid at all.

Along the way, Qin Yu did not encounter that Black Shadow again. He withdrew all of his internal Qi, afraid that he would accidentally provoke something that he should not have provoked.

Soon, Qin Yu arrived at the place where his divine sense went.

He stopped at the border and deliberately looked to the side.

“If I take another step forward, I will be able to see that Dragon Corpse,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to confirm whether the black shadow was activated by seeing the dragon corpse, so he was extremely nervous at this moment.

He took a deep breath and muttered softly, “I hope my thoughts are true...”

After saying that, he closed his eyes, mustered up his courage, and Strode forward.

This step was undoubtedly extremely difficult. The pressure in his heart had reached its peak, and his entire body was drenched in cold sweat.

Very quickly, he crossed this “Boundary line.”At this moment, Qin Yu was incomparably nervous. The moment his foot landed, his entire body trembled slightly.

However, the surroundings were completely silent. Nothing happened, and the anticipated black shadow did not appear.

“It’s real!”Qin Yu was instantly overjoyed!

This could prove that Qin Yu’s thoughts were real.

As long as his eyes saw the dragon corpse, he would be attacked by the Black Shadow!

As long as he closed his eyes and could not see the dragon corpse, the Black Shadow would not appear.

In order to confirm his thoughts, Qin Yu took a few more steps.

As expected, the black shadow still did not appear.

As such, Qin Yu was completely relieved.

He could not suppress the excitement in his heart and turned around to walk out of here quickly.

“This way, I will be able to find the dragon corpse.”Qin Yu grinned, revealing a bright smile.

Then, Qin Yu walked quickly to Zhuo Jing’s side.

Seeing that Qin Yu had returned safely, Zhuo Jing also heaved a sigh of relief.

He looked at Qin Yu and said with a smile, “I thought I really wanted to collect your corpse.”

“I’m Lucky,”Qin Yu said jokingly.

Then, Qin Yu told Zhuo Jing what had happened and his own speculation.

After Zhuo Jing heard it, he couldn’t help but say in surprise, “That is to say, as long as we close our eyes, we can enter the Dragon Burial Cave?”

“To be precise, it is like this. At least that Black Shadow won’t be activated,”said Qin Yu.

“If that’s the case, that Black Shadow is probably the consciousness body born from the Dragon Corpse Qi. I’m afraid it doesn’t even have a physical body.”

Zhuo Jing rubbed his chin, then he said, “There is indeed nothing wrong with your discovery, but... Have you ever thought that there might be other creatures besides that Black Shadow? “If there isn’t, I’m afraid this dragon burial cave would have been robbed long ago.”

After Zhuo Jing’s reminder, Qin Yu also sensed that something was wrong.

“You’re still the most meticulous kid,”Qin Yu said with a smile.

To be on the safe side, Qin Yu decided to send out another stream of divine sense to scout the way.

This time, Qin Yu wanted to prevent his divine sense from seeing the dragon corpse. He wanted to continue going deeper to see what he would encounter.

“Let me do it this time. Otherwise, your divine sense might hurt your foundation,”Zhuo Jing said.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and nodded. “Alright.”

Thus, Qin Yu told Zhuo Jing what he needed to pay attention to.

Zhuo Jing was a very meticulous person, so Qin Yu was more at ease.

Then, Zhuo Jing forced out a strand of divine sense and let him control the divine sense to scout the way.

Qin Yu sat at the side and waited silently. He was somewhat anxious.

The dragon corpse was right in front of him. It was a great treasure. If he could get it, it would definitely be a heavenly opportunity.

More than an hour later.

Zhuo Jing suddenly opened his eyes. His pupils constricted, and there was an indescribable fear in his eyes.

“How is it?”Qin Yu hurriedly asked.

Zhuo Jing slowly calmed himself down. He glanced at Qin Yu and shook his head. “I can’t. My divine sense has been erased.”

“Erased again?”Qin Yu frowned.

“Yes. This time, I still didn’t see clearly what it was,”Zhuo Jing said. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

This immediately put Qin Yu in a difficult position. He couldn’t help but sigh.

Could it be that he had come for nothing this time?

The secret burial of the dragon corpse was right in front of him, but he couldn’t get it at all.

“This dragon burial cave is extremely terrifying. It’s not something that people with our strength can pry into.”Zhuo Jing took a deep breath.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He knew very well in his heart that the dragon burial cave would be excavated sooner or later. At that time, it would probably become a place that everyone in the world could enter together.

But once that day arrived, how could it be the turn of small characters like them to get their hands on it?

“Qin Yu, it’s better to leave. The road of cultivation is still very long. There’s no need to rush this moment.”Zhuo Jing advised.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I started late. If I didn’t rely on this kind of opportunity, I’m afraid I would never be able to catch up to them.”

This dragon corpse was a heaven-sent opportunity. Qin Yu would never miss it.

He tried to take out the bracelet that Xiao Yu had given him. He put the bracelet on his hand and said in a low voice, “That powerful mysterious person let this bracelet activate on its own last time. This time, it might work.”

Therefore, Qin Yu mustered up his courage and walked into the depths.

“Qin Yu!”Zhuo Jing could not help but curse inwardly. Such actions were no different from sending himself to his death!

However, Qin Yu had already made up his mind. Zhuo Jing was definitely not able to stop him.

Soon, Qin Yu arrived at the border again.

His expression was extremely cold, and he was extremely nervous. Qin Yu took out his iron rod, bracelets, and all the secret treasures that could be used.

Then, he hung the venerable fifth mountain above his head. At that moment, the venerable fifth mountain had become even more mysterious. Streams of extremely mysterious internal Qi hung above Qin Yu’s head, and these internal Qi Protected Qin Yu beneath him.

On the other side of the galaxy, there were countless legends about the venerable fifth mountain. It was known as the number one mountain in the world, and there were even rumors that it was formed from Pangu’s head.

Although the small mountain in his hand was not the real venerable fifth mountain, it was equally mysterious.

Using it to fight against the Dragon Corpse Qi was Qin Yu’s greatest confidence, and also his last hope.

He walked with his eyes slightly closed, carefully walking towards the depths of the dragon burial cave.
