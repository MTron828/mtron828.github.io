Chapter 1003: Chapter 1,003, the three purple flames

Qin Yu hurried towards the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

Fortunately, it was night time, so there weren’t many people and no one noticed Qin Yu.

Qin Yu rushed all the way to the Pavilion Master’s building.

Just as he was about to jump onto the pavilion master’s Building, a young girl suddenly grabbed Qin Yu.

Turning around, he saw Taozi standing beside Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu?”Taozi’s face was a little surprised.

“Shhh...”

Qin Yu hurriedly made a shushing gesture.

He pulled Taozi to the side. Before he could speak, Taozi couldn’t wait to say, “What’s wrong with you lately? Why are they looking for you everywhere and saying that you’re some kind of evil person...”

Qin Yu waved his hand and said somewhat helplessly, “Do you believe it?”

“Of course I don’t believe it!”Taozi said with her eyes wide open.

“Then it’s fine,”Qin Yu said with a smile.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

He hurriedly looked at taozi and said, “Oh right, Taozi, what color is your spiritual fire now?”

“It’s red.”Taozi stared with her big round eyes and said with some puzzlement.

“What’s Wrong?”

Qin Yu shook his head and sighed, “I need the help of two alchemists who have the purple flame. But besides me and the pavilion master, there’s still one more. Is there a newcomer who has the Purple Flame in our Divine Alchemist Pavilion?”

When this topic was brought up, Taozi felt a little disappointed.

She sighed and said, “Let’s not talk about newcomers. Ever since that Wan Gu Qiong harassed the pavilion master, the Divine Alchemist Pavilion hasn’t accepted any newcomers for a long time.”

“Wan Gu Qiong? is he still pestering us?”Qin Yu frowned.

Taozi pointed at the pavilion master’s building and said, “He’s upstairs right now.”

Qin Yu’s pupils shrunk!

Wan Gu Qiong, this beast, was actually in the Pavilion Master’s Building?

“Damn it!”

Qin Yu cursed inwardly and immediately wanted to go upstairs.

Taozi hurriedly pulled Qin Yu back and said, “Don’t be rash. He has two martial saints by his side.”

Qin Yu’s expression instantly became even more unsightly, and he could not help but clench his fists.

“Pavilion master didn’t suffer any injuries, right?”Qin Yu suppressed his anger and asked.

Taozi said, “That’s not the case. With commander ye around, he didn’t dare to go too far. He just kept on using foul language.”

“Hu...”

Qin Yu let out a long breath.

“If you continue to persevere, it won’t be long before you can change this situation,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“Alright, you should come with me first and find a place to hide. I’ll inform you when the ancient jade is gone,”said Taozi as she held Qin Yu’s hand and walked.

Qin Yu nodded. This was the only thing he could do now.

He followed Taozi all the way to a mansion.

Qin Yu had never seen this mansion before. It seemed to be newly built.

“Zhang Yijiu and Xiao Qing are staying here,”Taozi said.

“They are all your old acquaintances. I don’t think they will say anything.”

“I’ll keep an eye on them now. I’ll let you know as soon as the Wan Gu Qiong leaves.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Thanks.”

“F * ck you!”Taozi rolled her eyes.

Qin Yu walked into the mansion quickly.

It had to be said that the environment of the mansion was not bad. The courtyard was filled with all kinds of exotic herbs. The moment he entered the door, the fragrance assailed his nostrils.

Qin Yu quickly walked into the room. As soon as he entered the door, he saw Zhang Yi Jiu and Xiao Qing sitting there playing chess.

The two of them were dressed rather comfortably. It was obvious that they were planning to sleep.

When they saw Qin Yu who suddenly barged in, the two of them were so scared that they screamed. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Don’t shout, don’t Shout!”Qin Yu hurriedly made a shushing gesture.

Zhang Yi Jiu glared at Qin Yu and said, “Why don’t you knock! Don’t you know how to knock when you enter a girl’s room? You’re taking advantage of my door!”

Qin Yu glanced at Zhang Yi Jiu and rolled his eyes. “With your figure, I wouldn’t even look at it if you showed it to me. Xiao Qing’s is more like it.”

Xiao Qing’s small face blushed and she hurriedly covered her body with her clothes.

The two quickly put on their clothes and then asked, “Why did you suddenly come here?”

Qin Yu lay on the bed and stretched. “I came back with something.”

“TSK, TSK, you’re really big-hearted. Now the Jingdu Martial Arts Association has listed you as a fugitive,”Zhang Yi Jiu muttered.

Then, she smiled evilly and said, “It’s almost the same treatment as our Han Palace.”

At the mention of Han Palace, Qin Yu suddenly remembered the “Elements”that tie Dan had mentioned before.

Therefore, Qin Yu took the opportunity to ask, “By the way, does the palace master of your Han Palace control some snow elements?”

“How do you know?”Zhang Yi Jiu asked in surprise.

“This is the secret of our Han Palace.”

Qin Yu scratched her head and thought to herself, “It seems that not many people in the world know about elements.”

“Then, have you mastered the elements?”Qin Yu continued to ask.

Zhang Yi Jiu shook his head and said, “The palace master said that the elements are all born, and can not be passed down the day after tomorrow.”

Qin Yu replied with an ‘Oh’and did not continue to ask.

Compared to Zhang Yi Jiu, Little Qing was much quieter.

She sat at the side and did not say a word.

“Why, are you homesick?”Qin Yu glanced at her and asked casually.

Before Little Qing said anything, Zhang Yi Jiu, who was beside her, muttered, “Isn’t that nonsense? I was staying at home and was fine. I was brought here by you for no reason.”

Qin Yu touched her nose and said guiltily, “Don’t worry. I’ll send you back very soon and let you reunite with your family.”

Little Qing smiled bitterly and said, “It’s not that simple. If I go back now, I’ll probably be regarded as a traitor. The second mystic realm will definitely not forgive me.”

“It’s alright. After I’ve taken down the second mystic realm, you can go back.”Qin Yu said with a slightly confident tone.

Zhang Yi jiu snorted and said, “Keep bragging. The second mystic realm is guarded by a peak martial saint. It’s not something you can touch.”

Qin Yu did not explain to Zhang Yi Jiu.

Tie Dan and the handlebar mustache had said that once Qin Yu had become a martial saint, he would be invincible in this realm.

Qin Yu also possessed such confidence.

As long as he became a martial saint, he would definitely go to the second secret area!
