Chapter 823: Comprehending the Divine Rank Spell!

The light in the Scripture Pavilion was dim. Qin Yu endured the pain in his body as he scanned his surroundings.

The first, second, and third level records were basically spells.

The fourth level was the development of the history of martial arts.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but say in a low voice, “There are three whole levels of spells. I’m afraid it won’t be that easy to find the spirit binding spell.”

Qin Yu only had three days. To find the spirit binding spell was undoubtedly like looking for a needle in a haystack.

But at the moment, Qin Yu had no other way. He could only search one book at a time.

There were many books, many of which were inherited from Buddhism.

Qin Yu picked up one book after another. In the blink of an eye, half a day had passed, but he still didn’t see the spirit binding spell.

Looking at Qin Yu’s speed, Zhuang Teng couldn’t help but ask in surprise, “Brother Qin, there are so many spells, but none of them are suitable for you?”

Qin Yu glanced at him and said perfunctorily, “Yes, none of them are suitable for me.”

Zhuang Teng thought for a moment and said with a smile, “Brother Qin, I know a spell that is extremely suitable for you.”

With that, Zhuang Teng walked quickly to a certain book pavilion.

A moment later, he came back with a spell book in his hand.

Zhuang Teng handed this spell book to Qin Yu and said, “This is a Divine Rank spell. It matches your physical body perfectly. You can try it.”

Qin Yu took the book and realized that the name of this spell was the vajra sacred physique.

This was similar to Qin Yu’s Saintly Body Technique. It would greatly increase the sturdiness and strength of the physical body.

However, compared to the Saintly Body Technique, the vajra sacred physique was obviously more powerful.

The Saintly Body Technique was only a basic technique. To the current Qin Yu, it was no longer of much use.

“This is indeed a good technique. It suits me quite well.” Qin Yu nodded slightly.

Then, he looked at Zhuang Teng and smiled. “Thank you.”

Zhuang Teng waved his hand and said, “Brother Qin, you don’t have to be so polite.”

Qin Yu could also see that Zhuang Teng’s personality was relatively gentle. He was the type of person that no one was willing to offend.

“Qin Yu, you really dare to take it.”

At this moment, a young man walked over from not far away.

Qin Yu glanced at him and frowned. “Who are you?”

The young man said indifferently, “My name is Teng Hui. I’m from Sea City.”

“Teng Hui?” Upon hearing this name, Qin Yu thought of something.

“What’s your relationship with Sea City’s Teng Gong?”

Teng Hui said with a faint smile, “Teng Gong is my biological uncle!”

Qin Yu immediately understood.

He had a feud with Teng Gong back then, so this Teng Hui naturally had enmity towards him.

“Teng Hui is right. It’s indeed impossible for you to comprehend this Divine Rank spell.” At this time, Kong Yun also walked over.

“What do you mean?” Qin Yu asked.

Kong Yun snorted coldly, “To comprehend a Divine Rank spell, it will take at least a week! And this is an extremely fast speed!”

“And Xia Hang only gave us three days. What do you think you can do with this Divine Rank spell?”

Zhuang teng also continued, “That is the truth. Among us, the one who comprehended the spell the fastest is Yan Jinyao. He also took six days to comprehend the Divine Rank spell.”

Qin Yu shook the vajra sacred physique in his hand and smiled. “I don’t need three days at all. At most, one day and I’ll be able to comprehend this vajra sacred physique.”

This wasn’t the first time Qin Yu had comprehended a Divine Rank spell.

In the memories left by his father, there were also Divine Rank spells.

For example, Qin Yu only used less than a day to successfully comprehend the Nine Absolute Beginning Slashes.

“Humph, he really knows how to brag,” Teng Hui sneered.

“Even if you try to comprehend an Earth Rank spell, it will take at least three days.”

“Mr. Qin, it is indeed not that simple to comprehend a Divine Rank spell.” Yao Meng also walked forward to advise him.

“Rather than wasting three days on this Divine Rank spell, it is better to choose an Earth Rank spell.”

“Miss Yao, I remember that you used four days to successfully comprehend a Divine Rank spell, right?” At this moment, Chu Hedao suddenly said.

A trace of shock flashed across everyone’s faces.

“Miss Yao is actually faster than Yan Jinyao?”

“I thought that Yan Jinyao broke the record with six days. I didn’t expect Miss Yao to use only four days!”

Yao Meng said modestly, “I was just lucky. Normally, I need at least a week.”

“Tsk, Miss Yao is really humble.” Chu Heng sighed.

“Qin Yu, you should change to another spell. I was lacking in consideration just now,” Zhuang Teng said helplessly.

“No, this will do.” Qin Yu shook the vajra sacred physique in his hand.

“I said, I only need a day at most to comprehend this vajra sacred physique.”

“You really can brag,” someone mocked.

“You, Qin Yu, are indeed strong, but is it possible for you to be good at everything?”

Teng Hui crossed his arms and sneered. “If you can comprehend the vajra sacred physique in a day, I, Teng Hui, will eat sh * t while standing on my head.”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said, “Really?”

Teng Hui sneered. “If you can comprehend a Divine Rank spell a day, I will do whatever you want me to do.”

“Deal.” Qin Yu didn’t waste time with him. He took the book and walked to the side.

Seeing this, everyone shook their heads helplessly.

Even Yao Meng felt helpless.

In her opinion, it was impossible for Qin Yu to comprehend a Divine Rank spell in a day. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

In other words, no one could comprehend a Divine Rank spell in a day!

“Qin Yu is just too prideful,” Yao Meng said helplessly.

Kong Yun snorted and said, “Do you call doing something impossible prideful? In my opinion, this is pure stupidity.”

Yao Meng smiled and didn’t say anything.

Everyone didn’t take Qin Yu and Teng Hui’s bet seriously.

After all, in their opinion, Qin Yu couldn’t do it.

Time passed by minute by minute.

In the blink of an eye, the sky gradually darkened.

Four hours had passed since Qin Yu started comprehending the spell.

Everyone held a spell book in their hands, but most of them were Earth Rank spells.

At this moment, Yao Meng’s body glowed and she stood up first.

She rubbed her fair neck, as if she was very tired.

Then, Kong Yun and the others woke up one after another.

“You’re actually faster than me?” Kong Yun frowned slightly when he saw Yao Meng, who woke up first.

Yao Meng smiled and said, “I’ve only just comprehended it.”

“Miss Yao, you’re being modest again.” Xiao Yuan walked forward and said with a smile.

“I have to say, Miss Yao’s speed is really enviable.” Chu Hedao also nodded slightly.

While everyone was flattering Yao Meng, Qin Yu’s body suddenly emitted rays of golden light.

This light surrounded Qin Yu’s body like a floating golden soup.

Not long after, a trace of internal qi was emitted from Qin Yu’s body.

“What... What does this mean?” For a moment, everyone’s eyes widened.

“He’s holding the vajra sacred physique. This scene... seems to be the scene of him comprehending the vajra sacred physique!”

“How is it possible?! He comprehended the Divine Rank spell in four hours?!”
