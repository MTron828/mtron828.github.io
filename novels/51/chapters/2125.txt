2126 Leaving Thunder Courtyard

In the following period of time, there were more and more visions in the sky. Many sects also began to have True Saints.

Not all these True Saints came from the nine great aristocratic families. Many small sects and even rogue cultivators seized the opportunity to quickly and decisively step into the True Saint Realm.

The Heavenly Heart Lake was a place that was once said to be the closest to the dao technique. However, this place had become a wasteland after a long period of time.

However, in a place like Heavenly Heart Lake, a young man was sitting cross-legged. His internal qi surged as the dao technique revealed. It was incomparably terrifying as if he was about to break through at any moment.

Beside him stood a young woman. The woman was beautiful. Her appearance made people feel refreshed and happy, not forgetting her even after a brief encounter.

She was staring at the young man in front of her with excitement in her eyes as if she wanted to witness something.

At this moment, the young man opened his eyes.

He stood up slowly and sighed subtly.

“Xiao Yuan,” the woman quickly walked to Xiao Yuan and said excitedly. “Are you about to break through?”

Xiao Yuan didn’t respond. He reached out his hand and gently stroked the woman’s face, his eyes filled with a strong sentiment of affection.

“Xiaowei, thank you for accompanying me for so long,” Xiao Yuan murmured.

Xiaowei was startled and said in a panic, “Xiao Yuan, are… are you leaving? I… I want to stay by your side!”

Xiao Yuan did not say anything. He turned his back to Xiaowei and was silent for a long time. Then, he let out a long sigh.

Xiaowei was at a loss and felt tremendously uneasy.

“Xiaowei… I’m sorry.” Xiao Yuan’s eyes became hazy as if they were fogged up.

Before Xiaowei could say anything, Xiao Yuan suddenly reached out, and his hand passed through Xiaowei’s chest!

Xiaowei’s eyes widened. She stared at Xiao Yuan and said in a trembling voice, “Why…Why…”

Xiao Yuan’s voice filled with unwillingness as he said, “This is my dao technique. I’m sorry…”

After saying that, a firm determination arose in Xiao Yuan’s heart, and he directly killed Xiaowei’s primordial spirit.

Xiaowei fell to the ground, motionless, no longer having any more internal qi.

Xiao Yuan sat there for a long time. He looked at Xiaowei’s corpse and was as if recalling the past.

After an unknown duration of time, Xiao Yuan slowly stood up. His gaze became firm and cold.

After saying that, he sat cross-legged and immediately began to break through.

After killing Xiaowei, Xiao Yuan’s dao technique reached its peak. Visions filled the sky, obviously a sign of breaking through to the True Saint.

Xiao Yuan sat on the wasteland of Heavenly Heart Lake. An intense surge of vital energy from the heavens and the earth surged into his body madly.

Visions kept appearing in the sky. After the stars fell, the sea of clouds churned, and rainbows crossed the sky. This phenomenon attracted the attention of the entire world.

Heavenly tribulation began to condense in the sky. Large patches of dark clouds covered the sky as if they wanted to devour the entire world.

After an unknown duration, the void slowly dissipated, and a tremendously powerful young man was born.

The moment he broke through, everyone felt a formidable pressure. It was as if a mountain had instantly pressed down on their hearts, suffocating them.

That was the internal qi of a True Saint. It was above all things in the world, and it announced his arrival in an invincible manner.

Then everyone saw that scene.

A young man was sitting in the middle of the lake. The sky above his head was flashing with visions, and his body was shining. His eye expression was cold and firm, without a trace of fluctuation. He was like a god, detached from the world and above all living beings.

After breaking through, Xiao Yuan looked at everything in front of him expressionlessly.

He stood up and looked at the sky. His seemingly calm eyes contained endless determination and deep sorrow.

But soon, his expression returned to calmness. It was terrifyingly calm.

…

In the outside world, the day of the Path of Heaven was fast approaching. Perhaps it was because of its arrival that the dao technique became stronger, and therefore more and more True Saints appeared.

However, Yan Guyun, who had been the center of attention, had yet to come out of seclusion. There was no movement from the Yan family either.

He and Si Liu were heaven’s favorites of that generation. Naturally, people would bring them together for comparison.

Si Liuhe had become famous all over the world, and everyone was afraid of him. However, Yan Guyun had not made any moves. Therefore, inevitably, people would start to speculate.

A few days later, a young man suddenly appeared in Zhongzhou.

In just a few days, he defeated three True Saints and exterminated a sect having many True Saints!

This person was none other than Xiao Yuan, who was once Qin Yu’s friend!

They came from Earth together, and his current strength was tremendously terrifying. His methods could be said to be heaven-defying!

Not only that, Xiao Yuan’s methods were exceptionally cruel. Wherever he went, nothing can thrive. From an over thousand-year-old elderly man to a two or three-year-old child, no one could escape his deadly actions!

“Who is this Xiao Yuan? In just a few days, he had massacred several sects!”

“Rumor has it that even Valley of Annihilation couldn’t withstand and was exterminated by him alone!”

“What? Even Valley of Annihilation couldn’t withstand? That was a thousand-year-old sect, but it was exterminated just like that…” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“This era is too terrifying. Who knows how many monstrous geniuses have been born? We might have to witness a great era that has never appeared before.”

At that moment, everyone was filled with anxiety and unease, and Xiao Yuan’s name was even pushed to the forefront of controversy.

At Thunder Courtyard.

Qin Yu’s comprehension of the Traceless Immortal Scripture had become even more thorough. His comprehension of the dao technique had also become even more intense. The Holy Power his body emanated had also increased.

At the rate of this progress, Qin Yu’s speed of stepping into the True Saint would far exceed his prediction.

As for Qin Yu’s true form, it was discussing dao with Dean Lei while playing chess.

“This era is really not peaceful,” Dean Lei sighed and said.

Qin Yu smiled and said as he played chess, “Perhaps it will be more interesting.”

“That’s right. After being silent for so many years, the competition in this era will definitely be even more exciting.”

Qin Yu placed the last chess piece in his hand, then stood up and said, “Dean Lei, I’m going to leave this place.”

“Hmm?” Dean Lei frowned.

Qin Yu slowly stood up. He stretched and said, “The world is so wonderful. I want to go and have a look.”

“Go and have a look? Now, all the aristocratic families are looking for you,” Dean Lei frowned and said.

“I have my own plans. Moreover…” Qin Yu smiled faintly. “I don’t want to be a weakling hiding behind others.”

Dean Lei was silent for a moment, then stood up and said, “You indeed won’t grow by hiding in the greenhouse. It doesn’t conform to your dao technique. Since you’ve decided, I won’t retain you.”
