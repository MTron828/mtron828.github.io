Chapter 2047: Temporarily Withdraw

Facing Qin Yu’s threat, Si Liuhe sneered.

“You can try to enter the Chaos Grave. I don’t have to do anything to you then,” Si Liuhe said coldly.

Obviously, the danger in the Chaos Grave had indeed shocked Si Liuhe.

He didn’t believe that anyone could break into the Chaos Grave alone.

Qin Yu frowned. He understood what Si Liuhe meant but could not give in now.

“Let’s try then!” Qin Yu shouted. “I hope you can send someone to wait for me outside the Chaos Grave! ”

Si Liuhe didn’t seem to care about Qin Yu anymore. He looked at the crowd and said blandly, “Everyone here today has opened my eyes. I, Si Liuhe, will definitely visit you one by one in the future.”

After saying this, the formation slowly opened, and the barriers disappeared.

The people in the Chaos Grave swarmed and fled, afraid that they would die in the Chaos Grave. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Si Shiyue gave Qin Yu a cold look and left.

As everyone left, Qin Yu also heaved a sigh of relief.

He looked at Xiao Hai beside him and said, “Brother Xiao Hai, let’s not leave this place for now in case they ambush us outside.”

“Alright, let’s wait for a while then,” Xiao Hai said.

At this moment, Saintess Gu came over from a distance.

She walked up to Qin Yu’s side and said with a smile, “Mr. Qin, long time no see. Have you forgotten about our shared upbringing?”

“Shared upbringing?”

Hearing this, the surrounding people widened their eyes. Their expressions slowly changed from shock to dubious.

Qin Yu coughed dryly and said, “Saintess Gu, as you can see, I can’t even take care of myself now. I’m being hunted everywhere. I don’t dare to go to Cold Moon Palace now.”

Saintess Gu covered her mouth and chuckled. She pretended to be resentful and said, “Mr. Qin is truly ruthless. This is clearly something that we share, but now you want me to raise it by myself.”

The moment she said this, it caused people to misunderstand even further.

“Brother, you’re awesome,” the man with the mustache poked Qin Yu’s shoulder and whispered.

“Don’t talk nonsense,” Qin Yu glared at him and said.

“Hahaha! Qin Yu, I won’t disturb you anymore,” Xiao Hai also laughed loudly and said.

“Brother Xiao Hai, why are you also…” Qin Yu was speechless.

Saintess Gu said seriously at this moment, “Alright, let’s get down to business. Mr. Qin, I’m afraid you have to be careful in the future. Si Liuhe’s strength cannot be underestimated. Even in our

Gu family, no one is willing to offend him.”

“Besides Si Liuhe, Yan Guyun is even more difficult to deal with. He is a battle maniac and incredibly dangerous.”

“Thank you for your reminder, Saintess Gu Gu,” Qin Yu nodded and said.

At this moment, Saintess Gu’s gaze fell on Xiao Hai.

“This friend’s strength has also shocked us. As expected of the legend of the Nanzhou, ” Saintess Gu covered her mouth and chuckled.

“You’ve heard of him?” Qin Yu asked in surprise.

“Xiao Hail s great name is like a thunderclap even in Zhongzhou,” Saintess Gu smiled and said.

Of course, there was some exaggeration in her words, but it also indirectly proved Xiao Hai l s reputation.

“You must be joking,” Xiao Hai said with a smile. “That’s just an undeserved reputation.”

“My friend, you don’t have to be so humble. I heard you have an elder brother?” Saintess Gu asked.

“Yes, his strength is more powerful than mine,” Xiao Hai nodded and said.

“I hope to get to know you if an opportunity arises in the future,” Saintess Gu said.

“Definitely.” Xiao Hai cupped his hands.

Saintess Gu didn’t stay any longer. She left after bidding goodbye to everyone.

As soon as Saintess Gu left, the man with the mustache said impatiently, “When did this happen between the two of you? Boy or girl? The offspring of the chaotic body and the Gu family’s saintess must be tremendously terrifying! How about you hand it over to me in the future?”

“F*ck you!” Qin Yu glared at him. “You’d better think about how we can escape!”

Among the people present, probably no one could compare to the man with the mustache man if they have attainments in spatial spells and formations.

They could only rely on the man with the mustache.

“Of course, I won’t miss it out,” the man with the mustache man narrowed his eyes and said. “As long as you’re here, we have a high chance of getting Wu Ji’s hidden treasure!” Just as Qin Yu wanted to enquire, Jiang He walked over from afar.

Upon seeing Jiang He, Qin Yu felt an indescribable excitement in his heart.

“Senior Jiang He!” He quickly stepped forward and cupped his hands.

“Based on my age, I don’t deserve to be addressed as a senior,” Jiang He waved his hand and said.

“No, I will forever remember the technique you taught me,” Qin Yu shook his head and said.

Jiang He didn’t dwell on this topic. He said in a deep voice, “Worst scenario, you come with me to the Jiang family.”

“Go to the Jiang Family?” Qin Yu laughed bitterly. “I’ve been to the Yao family before and nearly died there. The Jiang family…”

“The Jiang family cherishes talents,” Jiang He interrupted Qin Yu.

“Although my surname is Jiang, I don’t have much to do with the Jiang family.”

“Senior Jiang He, I’m afraid they’ve taken a fancy to your Nine Secrets,” Qin Yu shook his head and said.

“Qin Yu, you don’t have to be too sensitive,” Jiang He said with a smile. “Ever since I came to the Holy Region, I’ve never used the Nine Secrets.”

...

Hearing this, Qin Yu appeared somewhat embarrassed instantly.

“Of course, I understand you. After all, this is indeed a place where people’s hearts are unpredictable,” Jiang He said.

“I’ll definitely pay you a visit if there’s a chance!” Qin Yu hurriedly bowed and said.

At this point, Qin Yu suddenly thought of the other people on Earth.

“Senior Jiang He, have you met anyone else who also came to the Holy Region?” Qin Yu asked.

“You’re the first one,” Jiang He shook his head and said.

Qin Yu sighed. “I really hope everyone can get together. I wonder what they’re going through now.”

It was a heavy topic. After such a long time, there was still no news of them. Everyone knew they were probably behind the eight balls.

Jiang He did not stay for long. After all, he was a member of the Jiang family and had to go back to report on his mission. Thus he soon left.

After they left, the man with the mustache came forward and said, “The Jiang family is indeed not bad.”

“How do you know?” Qin Yu said in surprise.

The man with the mustache shrugged and muttered, “Back then, I went to the ancestral graves of the great aristocratic families. Only the Jiang family didn’t attempt to kill me.”

Qin Yu was speechless.

So was Xiao Hai.

The Chaos Grave spread just as the man with the mustache man had predicted. After it spread to the Tai Chi Diagram, it stopped.

In this Chaos Grave, everyone’s spiritual energy was suppressed. This place was filled with death qi. After a long time, the internal qi in their bodies would definitely be depleted.

Therefore, it was not a place to stay for long.

At the same time, outside the Chaos Grave, Si Shiyue was reluctant to leave..
