Chapter 1522: Chapter 1,522, the Terrifying Heavenly Tribulation 1 

The light was extremely dazzling, like a ray of light in the dark night, making people unable to open their eyes.

“It’s starting now?”Li Yingying couldn’t help but frown.

Zhuo Jing ignored Li Yingying and stared at Qin Yu.

“I’ve never seen a chaotic body transcend the heavenly tribulation...”Zhuo Jing murmured in a low voice.

The two of them had different thoughts, but their eyes were fixed on Qin Yu.

At this moment, Qin Yu opened his eyes slightly.

His entire body was emitting a resplendent golden light. He had long been prepared to resist the heavenly tribulation in his spatial magic artifact.

The Heavenly Tribulation of a mighty realm was definitely not simple. Even Qin Yu’s physical body didn’t dare to slight it.

Rumble..

Muffled sounds came from the dark clouds. From time to time, blue lightning flashed across the dark clouds as if something extremely terrifying was brewing.

Qin Yu slowly stood up from the ground. He immediately activated the Vajra sacred physique and prepared to welcome the heavenly tribulation.

Golden Light Enveloped Qin Yu’s body, outlining him like a great Buddha.

His body was surging with an indestructible battle intent, and his eyes were looking straight at the sky.

......

The dark clouds were getting darker and darker, indicating that this heavenly tribulation was extraordinary.

“What a terrifying heavenly tribulation...”Zhuo Jing gazed at the sky and couldn’t help but mutter.

Even Zhuo Jing had never seen such a heavenly tribulation.

“Rumor has it that the stronger one’s talent is, the more terrifying the heavenly tribulation will be,”Zhuo Jing said in a low voice.

“I’ve seen the heavenly tribulation of many geniuses in the past, and I was shocked by it. However, when I saw Brother Qin’s heavenly tribulation today, I realized that it was completely different.”

Even Ling Yun, who was known as the number one genius in the southern province, could not compare to Qin Yu in terms of heavenly tribulation!

“No Wonder Brother Qin wanted to find a quiet place. If there were cities around this area, who knows how many people would be attracted to this scale of heavenly tribulation,”Zhuo Jing sighed to himself.

It wasn’t just Zhuo Jing. Li Yingying was the same.

She had also stepped into the mighty realm as soon as possible, so she naturally knew what such a scale of heavenly tribulation meant.

“This Qin Yu...”Li Yingying muttered in a low voice. The more she thought about it, the more unbalanced she felt.

Why wasn’t such an outstanding man hers? Why did such a talented person ignore her?

The more she thought about it, the more intense the hatred in Li Yingying’s heart became.

She looked coldly in Qin Yu’s direction and bit her lips tightly.

At this moment, the first heavenly tribulation condensed in the sky.

Looking through the dark clouds, one could see a dragon-like lightning hidden in the darkness!

The lightning made a whistling sound as if it had a life of its own. One could even feel the coldness of the heavenly tribulation!

“Rumor has it that the heavenly lightning of a Peerless Heaven’s pride can give birth to divine sense! This is actually true!”Zhuo Jing could not help but exclaim when he saw this!

Even though they were far apart, Zhuo Jing and Li Yingying could feel the enormous energy contained within the heavenly tribulation!

“We can’t withstand a heavenly tribulation of this scale at all,”Zhuo Jing said in a low voice.

“Chop him to death, chop him to death!”Li Yingying roared crazily in her heart! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, the first heavenly tribulation descended.

“Boom!”

It was as if the heavenly tribulation was going to tear this space apart. It brought with it a whimpering sound as it headed straight for Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s face also revealed a trace of solemnity.

He did not dare to use his physical body to withstand a heavenly tribulation of this scale!

“Ten Thousand Spell Breaking Punch!”

Qin Yu roared angrily, and golden light instantly condensed on his right fist!

This fist that had accumulated an infinite amount of power could be said to be able to destroy anything!

The golden light and the icy blue light clashed head-on, as if two divine dragons were about to collide at this moment!

Zhuo Jing stared fixedly at this scene, and his heart was incomparably nervous!

“Boom!”

At the instant of the collision, it was as if the Milky Way had fallen into the nine heavens. The lightning was like water as it pounced on Qin Yu’s face, instantly drowning his entire body!

The strength on Qin Yu’s fist was instantly dissolved, and his right fist was drenched in blood. His body was ruthlessly slammed onto the ground!

Many of his bones were broken, and cracks appeared all over his body. Fresh blood flowed out from his mouth.

“What a terrifying heavenly tribulation!”

Seeing this scene, Zhuo Jing could not help but exclaim in surprise!

Even Qin Yu’s body could not withstand it. If it was an ordinary person, wouldn’t they instantly turn into ashes? !

“Good, well done!”Li Yingying was so excited that she almost jumped up!

Looking at Qin Yu who was lying on the ground like a dead dog, Li Yingying couldn’t help but smile.

However, at this moment, Qin Yu stood up from the ground again.

Although he was covered in blood, his fighting spirit didn’t decrease at all. Instead, his aura was even more magnificent!

“Damn it, this dog-like heavenly tribulation wants to kill me, right?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse.

He raised his head to look at the sky and said in a low voice, “Such a heavenly tribulation is even more terrifying than I imagined...”

Thinking of this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

He didn’t dare to hide his strength anymore and directly opened the third level of the fighting word formula.

“I wanted to survive the first three rounds of heavenly tribulation by relying on my physical body, but in the second round, I had to rely on the fighting word formula,”Qin Yu sighed.

Feeling the change in Qin Yu’s internal Qi, Zhuo Jing couldn’t help but be shocked!

“It seems that brother Qin hasn’t unleashed his true strength yet...”zhuo jing heaved a sigh of relief.

Li Yingying couldn’t help but sneer, “So what? This is only the first heavenly tribulation.”

Zhuo Jing glanced at Li Yingying, a hint of displeasure flashed across his face, but he didn’t say anything.

The second heavenly tribulation was brewing in the sky.

This heavenly tribulation had been brewing for a very long time. The rumbling sound was extremely ear-piercing, but it didn’t descend for a long time.

“The longer the heavenly tribulation is brewing, the more terrifying its power will be. I don’t know if brother Qin can withstand it...”Zhuo Jing said in a low voice.

“It would be better to chop him to death.”Li Yingying sneered in her heart.

“Boom!”

At this moment, a deafening sound was heard, causing the earth to tremble and collapse directly! Meanwhile, the canyon began to crack, and countless pieces of gravel rolled down!

Looking at the sky again, it was as if a hole had been torn open in the sky. Icy blue light poured down, almost drowning everything in the surroundings!

“Retreat quickly!”

Zhuo Jing hurriedly pulled Li Yingying and shot backward!

“Crash!”

The Heavenly Tribulation was approaching Qin Yu. Even though Qin Yu had activated the third level of the fighting word formula, he was still slammed to the ground the moment he touched it!

The ground turned into scorched earth. Half of Qin Yu’s body was smashed, and his flesh and blood flew everywhere.

The fresh blood was instantly evaporated by the lightning and disappeared without a trace.

“Brother Qin!”

Zhuo Jing’s expression changed drastically when he saw this scene!

Qin Yu, who was lying on the ground, looked extremely miserable. He had even lost his human form!

He struggled to get up from the ground and spat out a mouthful of blood.

Looking at the cracks on his body, Qin Yu’s heart became more and more solemn.

“If this continues, I won’t be able to withstand this heavenly tribulation...”Qin Yu said in a low voice.
