Chapter 1081: Chapter 1,081, facing off against Yan Jinyao! 

The next day.

In the vicinity of the Green Earth Park, more than ten realm lords were already waiting there.

Other than that, there were many spectators waiting for the start of this battle.

“Remember, you must act as soon as possible.”Yan Jinyao, who was rushing towards the Green Earth Park, said to He Teng

He Teng licked his lips and said darkly, “Don’t worry, this time he, Qin Yu, will definitely die...”

Yan Jinyao didn’t say anything. He didn’t know he Teng’s strength, so he didn’t feel confident.

On the other side, Qin Yu also walked out of the second secret realm and hurried toward Green Mountain Park.

As soon as he walked out of the second secret realm, Tian Xuehong’s figure appeared nearby.

“Finally... I finally have a chance!”Tian Xuehong’s eyes lit up, his heart full of excitement!

He did not waste any time and quickly entered the second mystic realm.

Qingdi Park.

He Teng blended into the crowd and waited for the opportunity to strike. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Yan Jinyao stood in the center and waited for Qin Yu’s arrival.

About ten minutes later.

Qin Yu drove over from not far away.

He got down from the car and his body shook as he arrived in front of Yan Jinyao in one step.

“Qin Yu!”

After sensing Qin Yu’s internal Qi, Yan Jinyao suddenly opened his eyes!

And the surrounding crowd was even more faintly excited!

This battle had been planned for too long, who knew how many people were looking forward to the battle between these two geniuses!

“Who is the number one person in the world, we will know the result today.”

“Yeah, the two of them are geniuses, it’s hard to say who is stronger or weaker.”

Qin Yu’s eyes swept through the surroundings, looking at the ten over realm lords.

“There are quite a lot of people.”Qin Yu said coldly.

“Mr. Qin, don’t misunderstand. We are only here to watch the battle. We will definitely not participate!”A realm lord hurriedly said.

Qin Yu snorted lightly and ignored them.

Even if they attacked together, Qin Yu wasn’t afraid at all.

“Qin Yu... I have been waiting for this day for a long time!”Yan Jinyao gritted his teeth, his expression incomparably cold.

Qin Yu sneered, “The same goes for me. From the moment you absorbed Yan Ruoxue’s bloodline, you have already been written on the list of the dead.”

“What arrogant words!”Yan Jinyao roared angrily. His body immediately emitted three rays of light!

One purple, once golden, and one weak green.

These three rays of light fused together and surrounded Yan Jinyao’s body.

Qin Yu’s pupils constricted slightly.

These three rays of light came from Yan Jinyao, Qin Yu, and Yan Ruoxue respectively!

“I have the bloodline of the two of you and have obtained all of your advantages. Qin Yu, you are definitely not my match!”Yan Jinyao roared angrily.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Is that so? Then don’t waste time. Make Your Move.”

The rays of light on Yan Jinyao’s body became more and more powerful. Those rays of light fused together and unleashed the three people’s respective advantages to the extreme!

“Everyone says that your physical body is strong. Let me give it a try today!”

Yan Jinyao roared angrily. He actually planned to fight Qin Yu with his physical body!

He clenched his fist and came over. The golden light instantly erupted and wrapped around his physical body!

At this moment, Yan Jinyao’s body became countless times stronger. His strength also unknowingly exploded!

Looking at Yan Jinyao who was shooting towards him, Qin Yu’s expression was extremely calm.

Just as Yan Jinyao was getting closer, Qin Yu suddenly attacked!

“Bang!”

With an extremely fast speed, he charged towards Yan Jinyao!

With a loud clang, the golden light surrounding Yan Jinyao’s fist was instantly shattered!

Qin Yu’s fist penetrated through this level of golden light and ruthlessly struck Yan Jinyao’s fist!

“Kacha!”

A slight crisp sound was immediately heard!

Cracks appeared on the bones of Yan Jinyao’s hand! His figure even took a few steps back!

When everyone saw this, their expressions changed drastically!

Although it was only a single punch, they could see through who was stronger with a single glance!

Yan Jinyao’s expression also did not look too good. He knew that his physical body was no match for Qin Yu, but he did not expect the gap to be so huge!

“Is that all you have?”Qin Yu looked at Yan Jinyao coldly.

Yan Jinyao shook his fist and said with a sneer, “That was just a small test. What’s next is my true ability!”

With that said, Yan Jinyao’s body was enveloped by the three kinds of lights! They quickly merged with his body! In the end, they actually turned into a faint purple-gold color!

Divine power was emitted from his body, like the boiling sea. It was extremely terrifying.

Following that, Yan Jinyao let out an explosive shout and slashed out with his saber. In an instant, streams of white light slashed towards Qin Yu!

This attack was incomparably powerful, splitting the air in two. It was as if even the Great Dao was making way for it!

That terrifying power crushed over, as if it wanted to Slash Qin Yu in one strike!

Qin Yu was completely unafraid. He snorted coldly, and an undefeatable golden light erupted from his body. His golden fist smashed towards the white light!

“Swoosh!”

At this moment, the Golden Light and the white light interweaved. The space was instantly twisted and a strange sound was emitted!

This Yan Jinyao was a top-notch genius. Moreover, he possessed the bloodlines of Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue. Naturally, his strength was unrivaled!

As an early-stage martial saint, he even possessed strength that was not inferior to Zhai Xing!

The white light interweaved on his fist and actually transformed into an indestructible might. It seemed like it was going to Devour Qin Yu!

Qin Yu snorted coldly. His entire body trembled as he raised his left palm and smacked forward.

This palm seemed to have comprehended the Great Dao, and it actually evolved into lifelike divine diagrams!

The divine diagrams emitted an internal Qi that instantly shattered the white radiance. Following that, it smashed towards Yan Jinyao at an extremely fast speed!

Yan Jinyao’s expression changed drastically! This evolution was the result of comprehending the Great Dao. Its power was unimaginable!

He did not have time to think and hurriedly used a spell to resist!

But the moment the divine map landed on his body, he was stunned.

This divine map actually did not have any strength. It was like a snowflake. The moment it landed on his body, it disappeared without a trace!

“Not good!”Yan Jinyao cursed inwardly. He suddenly guessed something!

Before he could respond, Qin Yu had already appeared behind the Divine Map!

He turned into a golden light, like a god’s mansion, or like a rolling train, shooting toward Yan Jinyao!
