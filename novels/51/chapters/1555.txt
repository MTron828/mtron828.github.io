While everyone was puzzled, Zhong Wu walked towards Qin Yu with a smile.

This smile couldn’t help but make Qin Yu feel a little disgusted.

His face was also filled with suspicion.

“Qin Yu, Why Are You Back?”Zhong Wu said with a chuckle.

When these words were said, everyone was shocked!

What? Back? What did these words mean?

Could it be that Zhong Wu admitted that Qin Yu was a member of the hunter organization?

Qin Yu also sensed that something was wrong. He looked at Zhong wu coldly and said, “What do you mean?”

Zhong Wu said with a faint smile, “Qin Yu, you are a member of the Hunter Organization for one day, and you will be a member of the Hunter Organization for the rest of your life. This will always be your home.”

When he said this, before Qin Yu could respond, Zhong Wu threw the old man in front of Qin Yu.

He sighed and said, “You came here for Jing Bai and Guan Zhuang, right? To tell you the truth, I was also deceived by the villain.”

Qin Yu glanced at the old man on the ground and said, “The villain you are talking about is him?”

“Yes!”Zhong wu nodded hard.

......

“I have always treated him as a military counselor and listened to him in everything. It is because of this reason that I listened to the slander of the villain.”

“After many days of investigation, I finally discovered his ugly face. Qin Yu, I will leave him to you to handle!”

Qin Yu sneered. Although he did not know what Zhong Wu was up to, Qin Yu knew that Zhong Wu definitely did not have any good intentions.

After thinking for a moment, Qin Yu said, “In that case, release Jing Bai and Guan Zhuang.”

“Of course, of course. I’ll release them immediately. Why don’t we have a chat in the room?”Zhong Wu said with a smile.

Qin Yu still needed Zhong Wu’s help to open the dungeon, so he agreed.

Zhong Wu took the lead and walked forward, followed closely by Qin Yu.

The surrounding hunters couldn’t help but look at each other.

What was going on? Zhong Wu’s reaction seemed a little abnormal. Didn’t he keep saying that he wanted to kill Qin Yu?

After returning to his room, Zhong Wu got up and rummaged through the cabinets, taking out a bag of tea leaves.

He personally brewed a pot of tea for Qin Yu, then got up and poured a cup for Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, actually, there is no deep hatred between us. Everything is just a misunderstanding,”zhong wu sighed.

Qin Yu sneered in his heart, but his face remained calm.

“Don’t say so much. Let him go first,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Zhong wu smiled and said, “Don’t worry. I’ll definitely let him go.”

“Not necessarily. I want you to let him go now,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Hearing Qin Yu’s order, a trace of displeasure flashed through Zhong Wu’s heart.

He suppressed his anger and stood up. “Alright, I’ll release him now. Wait for me here for a moment.”

“I’ll go with you.”Qin Yu stood up and said.

Then, Qin Yu followed behind Zhong Wu and walked toward the prison.

They arrived at the prison. Zhong Wu stepped forward and took out the white bone club. He gently placed it on the iron door of the prison.

In an instant, the iron door exploded with an extremely dazzling light!

In the next second, the iron door slowly opened.

“Jing Bai, Guan Zhuang, come out quickly!”Qin Yu rushed forward and shouted to the people below.

The two of them did not seem to have thought that they would be able to come out one day, so a trace of confusion flashed across their faces.

“What are you waiting for? Come out quickly!”Qin Yu frowned and said.

Only then did the two of them come back to their senses and hurriedly climbed out of the dungeon.

“Qin Yu, are you satisfied now?”Zhong Wu said with a faint smile.

Qin Yu said with a faint smile, “It’s good that you’re out.”

“Then let’s have a chat in the room. I think the misunderstanding between us should be resolved today,”Zhong Wu said.

After saying this, Zhong Wu took the lead and walked forward.

“Qin Yu, what... What’s going on?”Guan Zhuang asked with a puzzled look.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I don’t know either.”

“Qin Yu, I don’t know what Zhong Wu is scheming in his heart. You’d better be careful. Don’t trust him so easily,”Jing Bai reminded him.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Don’t worry, of course I know.”

Then, Qin Yu walked in the direction of Zhong Wu.

Jing Bai and Guan Zhuang looked at each other and quickly chased after him.

After returning to the room, Zhong Wu took a sip of tea.

“Qin Yu, you and I are both from the hunter organization. We should do something for the hunter organization,”Zhong Wu said first.

Hearing this, Qin Yu looked at Jing Bai and said, “If that’s the case, why did you give Jing Bai’s position to someone else?”

Zhong wu said innocently, “I did this not for selfish reasons, but for the development of the Hunter Organization.”

“Jing Bai is a straightforward person and has caused the hunter organization to lose a lot. I had no choice but to let him leave that position.”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “I want you to resume Jing Bai’s position now.”

Zhong wu nodded without thinking and said, “No problem, Jing Bai. From tomorrow onwards, you continue to accept the mission.”

Jing Bai remained silent, but he had a bad premonition in his heart.

Meanwhile, Qin Yu, who was at the side, laughed coldly in his heart.

He had already seen through Zhong Wu’s thoughts, but his face did not show much of a reaction.

“Zhong Wu, is what you said true?”Guan Zhuang, who was at the side, was clearly much more innocent.

Zhong wu nodded and said, “Of course.”

“Then you have to publicly apologize to Jing Bai,”Guan Zhuang muttered.

A trace of coldness flashed across Zhong Wu’s heart, but he still maintained a smile on his face.

“No problem. If you did something wrong, you should admit it,”Zhong Wu said with a smile.

Jing Bai, who was at the side, frowned and said, “Zhong Wu, why do you suddenly look like a different person?”

Zhong wu sighed and said, “I just understand a lot.”

Then, Zhong Wu looked at Qin Yu and said, “Come, Qin Yu, have some tea. You are welcome to supervise me in the future.”

Qin Yu said indifferently, “If team leader Zhong really thinks so, then it’s naturally the best.”

After saying that, Qin Yu picked up the cup in front of him and drank it in one gulp.

Seeing this scene, Zhong Wu sneered in his heart.

Qin Yu, who had just drunk the tea, had a slight change in expression.

Then, his face turned red, and even breathing became a little difficult.

“What... What’s going on!”Qin Yu widened his eyes and said with fear.

Seeing this scene, zhong wu finally tore off his hypocritical mask.

“Hahahaha!”Zhong Wu stood up and laughed loudly.

“Qin Yu, if you want to fight with me, I’m afraid you’re still too young!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Qin Yu’s expression was ugly as he said with a trembling voice, “There’s poison in this tea!”

“Hahahaha! That’s right! And I’m telling you, the group leader also died because of this poison!”Zhong Wu said coldly.
