1982 Cutting Stone

Hearing Gu Xinghe’s words, a smile appeared on Yang Tong’s face.

“I’ll leave this matter to you,” Yang Tong said indifferently.

Gu Xinghe’s face darkened, and he could not help but curse in his heart.

This old b*stard indeed refused to take any blame.

However, Gu Xinghe had no other choice but to nod and say, “Alright, leave this matter to me. My people are already on their way to Nanzhou.”

“Don’t worry,” Yang Tong said with a smile. “You’ll get your share of the benefits after this is done. A mere Serene South City is not your destination.”

Hearing what Yang Tong said, Gu Xinghe instantly felt much better.

…

At the other end, Qin Yu and Jue Wu had arrived at the gambling house.

Their arrival instantly attracted the attention of most people.

Many looked at Qin Yu and couldn’t help but softly discuss animatedly.

“Could it be that this Qin Yu has some ability?”

“Who knows? They’ve been causing a lot of trouble in Sky City the past few days. They definitely don’t have any good intentions to come here this time.”

“This is a gambling house, different from other places. I don’t think they can do anything here.”

Qin Yu did not care about the discussions among the crowd. He planned to immediately use his desolate divine eye to retrieve the stone.

But soon, Qin Yu realized something was wrong. In this gambling house, even the desolate divine eye was suppressed!

When Qin Yu tried to activate his desolate divine eye, he could clearly feel an incredibly mysterious force suppressing him.

“What treasure is this?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

“Kid, are you buying or not?” the cultivator at the gambling table couldn’t help urging.

Without the help of the desolate divine eye, Qin Yu could not choose the natural ore accurately.

Qin Yu had no choice but to pick one randomly.

The cultivator sneered. He took the natural ore that Qin Yu was pointing at and said, “Are you going to cut it?”

“Yes,” Qin Yu muttered.

Actually, he wasn’t confident either. Qin Yu had chosen it purely by luck.

In this place, not to mention using the desolate divine eye, even using divine sense was useless. All methods were suppressed. Everything here was relied on being suppressed.

It was due to this that the gambling house could ensure its profit to give a huge amount of income to the Si family every year.

The master of the natural ore quickly took over the ore that Qin Yu had selected. A knife appeared in his hand.

Everyone was watching this scene because they wanted to see if Qin Yu had any special abilities.

As the divine blade landed on the natural ore, it was cut open bit by bit. A buzzing sound could be heard instantly.

The dark gray natural ore was slowly cut open.

Everyone held their breath as they stared at that natural ore.

“D*mn! Something came out!” someone exclaimed.

A trace of black could be seen in the natural ore. This black color was tremendously pure, like some kind of secret treasure.

Qin Yu could not help but be overjoyed. Could it be he was so lucky that he had really cut out some treasure?

The divine blade continued to cut down, and half of the natural ore had been cut. Unfortunately, there was only that shade of black in the entire natural ore, and the rest was useless.

“D*mn! I thought there was some treasure.”

“D*mn! It’s just a black stone. I was excited for no reason.”

“It seems like this kid doesn’t have any real skills.”

The entire natural ore was cut open, but nothing was inside.

“You saw it, right? There was nothing.” The master of stone cutting threw the ore to the side.

Qin Yu was unresigned. He picked it up and crushed it with his brute force.

However, there was really nothing inside. It was empty.

“Tsk! There’s nothing.” Seeing this, the surrounding people scattered and ignored Qin Yu.

Qin Yu, who doubted what had happened, immediately picked up a few more natural ores and cut them open on the spot. However, there was still nothing.

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu had spent nearly 100 million spirit coins.

The price in the Si family’s gambling house was tremendously high. Based on Qin Yu’s way of playing, not only would the Si family be anxious, but Qin Yu also would be even more anxious.

Seeing Qin Yu’s defeat, the nervous cultivators of the gambling house felt relaxed and even looked contemptuous.

“Sigh! Without the desolate divine eye’s support, it’s so difficult to get any treasures.” Qin Yu shook his head helplessly.

The gambling house was tremendously huge, and natural ores were everywhere. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

This was only at the first level. The natural ores at the second level were even more expensive. Any one of them could be worth tens of millions of spirit coins, and the chances of it being a treasure were incredibly low.

Helplessly, Qin Yu could only turn his head and look at the innocent-looking Jue Wu.

Jue Wu didn’t know much about this thing, but as a foodie and gambler, Jue Wu was naturally interested in stone betting.

“You should do it,” Qin Yu said.

Jue Wu rubbed her hands and said excitedly, “I can’t wait!”

...

After saying this, Jue Wu walked forward. She walked around the natural ores in front of her, put her hands behind her back, and shook her head like a little adult.

Then Jue Wu walked toward another stone pool.

Although Qin Yu didn’t know whether Jue Wu knew it or not, he obediently followed behind her.

After going around a dozen or so stone pools, Jue Wu did not intend to stop.

“What are you looking at?” Qin Yu said helplessly.

“There are only a hundred or so stone pools on the entire first level of the gambling house. You’ve already gone through a dozen or so.”

Jue Wu glanced at Qin Yu and said with a grave expression, ” This bullsh*t place is just for show. All are empty stones.”

Qin Yu was startled. He quickly pulled Jue Wu to the side and whispered, “You can tell?”

“I can’t tell.” Jue Wu shook her head.

“Then how did you come to that conclusion?” Qin Yu was a little confused.

“A woman’s intuition. My intuition tells me that there is no treasure in these broken stones,” Jue Wu said seriously.

...

Qin Yu was speechless.

Although he was speechless, Qin Yu still followed Jue Wu and continued walking around.

“Stop going around. The treasures on the first level are not worth mentioning. Why don’t you go to the second level and try? As long as you pay 100 million spirit coins, you’ll be able to go to the second level,” the gambling house cultivator said with a hint of mockery.

Before he finished speaking, Jue Wu suddenly stopped.

“This is it,” she said, staring at a natural ore. “I have a feeling there must be something hidden inside!”

The cultivator in the stone pool took a step forward and said, “This natural ore is worth 300 million. Are you sure you want this?”

“This is it!” Jue Wu patted her chest and said.

The cultivator sneered. He picked up the natural ore and said, “Then I’ll just cut it?”

“No, don’t ruin my luck with your lousy technique,” Jue Wu grumbled.

After saying this, Jue Wu took that piece of natural ore and began to rub it with her small hands. The outer layers of the stone began to fall off.
