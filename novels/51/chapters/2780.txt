“Alright, why don’t you give me your remaining things?”

The person in front said indifferently.

Yi Yun instantly placed his hands on his face as he had received an order.

Then, his head turned 180 degrees with a sudden force.

A ball of flames slowly burned. In an instant, his body was burnt into ashes.

The two Hearts of Saint Kingdom remained on the ground. Yi Yun had previously collected them.

The monk slowly put down the robe wrapped around his head and picked up the Hearts of Saint Kingdom on the ground.

His palm moved slightly. The power of the two Hearts of Saint Kingdom surged.

The energy corresponding to these two Saint Kingdoms erupted in the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom.

In an instant, dark clouds covered the entire sky of the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom.

Countless lightning bolts flashed and a wave of energy as thick as the sea soared into the sky.

Then, they suddenly fell to the bottom of the cliff. The Star of David then suddenly appeared in front of Chen Zhisha.

After the energy gathered in his hand, it suddenly gathered and bounced back into the air at an even faster speed. Then, it left The Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom immediately.

“This power!”

Qin Yu’s Seal of Heaven Returning slowly lit up. Meanwhile, Chang Mang also sensed it.

“Have you noticed it too? The person who stole the Saint Power has appeared again!”

Qin Yu said with a solemn expression.

“That’s right. The Hearts of Saint Kingdom can sense each other. The power of the Heart of Saint Kingdom just now seems to have dimmed a lot. Moreover, this person is also at the bottom of the cliff! ”

Chang Mang said coldly.

Every time the power of Saint Kingdom was lost, Chang Mang’s power would weaken.

This was similar to the holy daughter but the impact on Chang Mang was smaller.

“This is the person who cooperated with the monster race’s Zi Yang!”

Qin Yu’s body tensed up as he thought of a possibility.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

This person had openly stolen the Saint Power here while he and Chang Mang had a total of 20 Hearts of Saint Kingdom. This wasn’t a coincidence, was it?

Pa!

The sound of countless bubbles bursting entered their ears. A person gently landed on the ground.

His body was emitting a layer of holy light. One could vaguely hear Buddhist words surrounding him.

The Creepy power surrounded him but dared not approach this layer of Buddha’s light.

“It’s you! Chen Zhisha!”

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely furious.

He was Chen Zhisha of the Ten Thousand Buddha Sect. This person had met Qin Yu several times in the lower realm.

Furthermore, he had once sided with the monster race, allowing the race’s

Godly King to offer sacrifice successfully and causing hundreds of millions of humans to die tragically.

The reason was that he wanted to preserve the human race in his way.

Qin Yu was filled with anger at this moment. He suddenly remembered the monk he met on the spaceship.

Could it be that the traitor of the Faramita that the monk mentioned was Chen Zhisha?

“Sir, we’ve parted in the lower realm. We’ve finally met again!”

“Attack with all your strength. This monk is powerful. He’s even stronger than the holy daughter!”

The holy daughter had once tracked this person down, but she had returned with serious injuries in the end.

To be able to severely injure a holy daughter who possessed a God’s Space, one could imagine how powerful Chen Zhisha was.

“Hell Nightmare!”

In the space of the dream realm, Qin Yu’s Night Qi slowly condensed into a body.

Fleeing Shadow!

Intense silver holy energy burst out of Qin Yu’s fist and landed on Chen Zhisha at the same time as the Hell Nightmare’s punch.

“The power of the Dao of Dreams is indeed mysterious. However, my mind remains the same, without any fluctuations. How can you trigger the hidden power of my divine soul?”

Chen Zhisha said softly.

The kasaya on his body was torn open, revealing the golden body of the Buddhist Sect.

Buddhist Sect’s golden body, Acalanätha!

As the golden body completely lit up, Qin Yu only felt an extreme anger lock onto him.

That was the Buddha’s Fury, the fire of Acalanätha.

A suffocating force was about to melt Qin Yu completely.

Primal Chaos Flame!

A nearly white flame fell in the middle of the sea of fire. The world was then instantly filled with Primal Chaos Flame.

In an instant, Acalanätha flames were devoured.

“Bast* rd! ”

Qin Yu activated the power of the Primal Chaos Flame and surrounded Chen Zhisha!

Energy burst out from the flames and formed a human-shaped passageway.

Chen Zhisha slowly walked out from within. The golden light on his body became even more intense than before.

The power of the Primal Chaos Flame could not do anything to him.

He took a step and arrived in front of Qin Yu.

A simple punch was thrown out.

Such a simple punch had turned Qin Yu’s world into the end.

It was as if there was only Chen Zhisha’s punch in the world he was in.

Qin Yu’s body instantly exploded. His body kept changing between reality and illusion.

In the endless dream realm, a powerful force followed and destroyed the realm.

It was unknown how many dreams Qin Yu had experienced before he completely transferred this power into the dream realm. At this moment, his Night Qi was almost exhausted.

Qin Yu was shocked.

He was so strong!

No wonder he could injure the holy daughter so easily.

A fireball fell from the sky. It was an extremely powerful arrow.

After gathering all his power, Aiden finally released his strongest arrow.

The terrifying arrow landed on Chen Zhisha’s head.

The huge force sent Chen Zhisha flying.

However, he didn’t seem to be in any trouble. He took another step forward and arrived in front of Aiden.

So near yet so far.

Aiden’s body exploded with the power of the elves.

The Sun Chasing Bow formed a circle on the ground and an ice-cold power swept out instantly.

Frost Rakshasa!

Countless ice vines instantly formed on the ground.

The ice vines wrapped around Chen Zhisha’s arm.

Aiden’s face was pale as if he had used too much strength.

In the blink of an eye, hundreds of ice vines had already shattered into ice powder.

Frost Rakshasa couldn’t stop Chen Zhisha at all.

Boom!

Chang Mang pulled Aiden away.

The purple lightning energy exploded and collided with Chen Zhisha’s fist.

Chang Mang’s body was sent flying, smashing through countless stone walls.

One of his arms was dangling in a strange posture. It was crippled by one strike.

“Divine Might Chasing Star, you are fated to be here.”

Chen Zhisha said to Chang Mang.

“F*ck you!”

Chang Mang spat out a mouthful of blood.

His body smashed out once again. This time, the force was stronger than before.

“It’s indeed a battle holy body. Its strength will continue to grow in battle. Since that’s the case, I’ll have to end this quickly.”

Chen Zhisha smiled faintly.

He lifted the kasaya in his right hand and placed it on his arm.

Countless runes slowly appeared. Roaring evil ghosts suddenly pierced through the space.

They came out immediately as if they had smelled delicious food..
