1854 Conditions

Qin Yu’s expression turned bone-chillingly cold. Even Demon Jingshan, standing in front of him, felt slightly uncomfortable.

“First, tell me what happened to these people,” Qin Yu pointed at the corpses all over the ground and said in a deep voice.

Demon Jingshan opened his mouth, and looked like he did not want to tell Qin Yu.

Chang Mang said impatiently, “Why are you talking nonsense with him? Just search his divine sense.”

!!

Qin Yu didn’t choose to do that. Instead, he asked tentatively, “Is it related to Life Aura?”

When he heard this, a trace of shock flashed across Demon Jingshan’s face.

“It seems I was right,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Following that, Qin Yu stood up and said, “This is the last chance I’m giving you. It’s also your last chance to live. I can kill you and report back if you don’t tell me. You think about it yourself.”

Demon Jingshan fell silent.

After a moment, he sighed and slowly said, “It’s indeed related to the Life Aura. These people were providing me with the Life Aura.”

Qin Yu turned around and waited for Demon Jingshan to continue.

“A few years ago, I came across a holy method by chance. This method explains how to deprive others of their vitalities and use them for one’s own use,” he said slowly.

“I captured all the people you saw in front of you for feeding. I extracted their vitalities for my use. When their vitalities are exhausted, they will dry up and die.

“Their vitalities not only can increase my lifespan but also upgrade my cultivation.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu turned ashen.

He did not expect to have such a cultivation method in this world, which was to increase one’s own lifespan by taking the vitalities of others!

In this world, no matter what cultivation realm one was in, one’s lifespan would be limited. It was the same for even the great cultivators at the Tribulation Stage.

No matter what cultivation one had, one would eventually become a grave. Even those who defied the heavens and changed fate could only slightly increase the upper limit of their lifespans and delay the arrival of death.

And this old Demon Jingshan in front of him had such a method!

If the top-tier great cultivators obtained such a method, it would be a disaster!

For the sake of their lifespans, they were likely to go on a killing spree and turn the entire world into their breeding pools to ensure their longevity. How terrifying was that?

“You… How long have you been doing this?” Qin Yu said with a gloomy face.

“I can’t remember exactly how long. I only know that this is the 3,800th batch of people who have provided me with vitality.”

There are 100 people per batch. In other words, for 3,800 batches, he had deprived at least 380,000 cultivators of their lifespans!

“You d*mn b*stard. I’m going to kill you!” Chang Mang calculated and was instantly enraged. He gritted his iron fist and stepped forward!

If it were any other time, Qin Yu would have killed this Demon Jingshan with a single punch. But for Qin Yu, nothing was more important than saving Jue Wu.

As Qin Yu had said, he was willing to make any sacrifice as long as he could save Jue Wu.

“You’re indeed ruthless.” Qin Yu coldly looked at Demon Jingshan with a gloomy look.

Demon Jingshan was like a dead mouse that felt no cold. He said coldly, “You said you would spare my life.”

Qin Yu paused for a moment before he continued to ask, “Let me ask you. Where’s the Life Aura that you have accumulated?”

“It’s in that formation,” Demon Jingshan said.

Qin Yu looked in the direction, sneered, and said, “It’s been such a long time, but your cultivation isn’t that great, though.”

Demon Jingshan sneered and said, “What do you know? What I’ve improved is more about my lifespan. Now, I can live for at least 5,000 years!

It was indeed an extremely terrifying number. The lifespan of a Reversion Void Stage cultivator was around 4,000 years. Even those who had long lifespans would find it hard to live past 4,500 years.

“You look like you have a destiny of short lifespan. If I kill you with one punch right now, will your lifespan be wasted?” Chang Mang snorted coldly and said.

Demon Jingshan didn’t say anything and only grunted.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “I want you to do something for me now. As long as you do it, I promise to spare your life.”

“Tell me, what’s it?” Demon Jingshan said in an extremely calm manner.

Qin Yu pointed at the formation and said, “If you want to live, you’ll have to turn yourself from an initiator to a victim,”

A trace of suspicion flashed across Demon Jingshan’s face. He frowned and said, “What do you mean?”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “From now on, this formation has nothing to do with you. You were forced to do it by someone and had no choice. Only by doing this can you survive.”

Demon Jingshan was stunned for a moment before he suddenly understood.

It was as if he had grabbed onto a life-saving straw as he said anxiously, “This is indeed a good way! However… Can this trick Demon-slaying Peak?”

“Of course not,” Qin Yu said coldly. “But I can testify for you.”

Demon Jingshan was overjoyed. Obviously, he did not expect to have a chance to live. The despair he felt earlier was instantly swept away!

But very quickly, Demon Jingshan frowned.

He looked at Qin Yu suspiciously and said, “Why are you helping me? Don’t tell me you also want to obtain this method?”

“Help you?” Qin Yu said coldly. “I can’t wait to tear you into a thousand pieces, so why would I help you?”

“Then what’s your reason?” Demon Jingshan was even more puzzled.

Qin Yu squinted his eyes and said, “You don’t need to know. You just need to understand that from now on, you have to grit your teeth and say that it’s the Tong family of Zhongzhou that has forced you to do this.”

“The Tong family of Zhongzhou? Tong Lianyang?” Demon Jingshan asked in a deep voice. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“I don’t know. I only know that he has a son, Tong Guangqing.” Qin Yu said.

Demon Jingshan nodded and said, “That’s right, it’s him. Why? Do you have a grudge against him?”

“I’ve told you. You don’t need to know so much,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Tell me, are you agreeable?”

Demon Jingshan sneered and said, “I agree. Of course, I agree. If I can keep my life, why wouldn’t I agree? However, I have a condition.”

“You still f*cking dare to state conditions?” By the side, Chang Mang was instantly furious and acted as if he wanted to make a move.

Qin Yu suppressed his anger and said coldly, “What condition?”

“Not only do you have to spare my life, but you can’t cripple my cultivation. After I’m done with this, you’ll immediately send me out of Thunder Courtyard,” Demon Jingshan said indifferently.

“You’re pretty smart,” Qin Yu sneered and said.

“Do you agree or not?” Demon Jingshan asked.

Qin Yu squinted his eyes, sneered, and said, “Alright. I promise you.”
