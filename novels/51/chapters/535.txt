Chapter 536: Qin Yu VS Han Wei Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

At this moment, Han Wei’s strength had suddenly increased by several points.

Even the geniuses of Jingdu in the distance revealed a trace of surprise on their faces.

“What kind of technique is this?” Zhuang Teng asked in surprise.

“I don’t know. It’s probably the inheritance of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

“Han Wei’s internal qi is so strong. Even though he’s several meters away, it still makes people feel a trace of fear.”

On the stage, Han Meng said proudly, “Mr. Yan, the show has officially begun. Just wait and see how your son-in-law performs.”

Yan Sihai nodded slightly, and a satisfied smile finally appeared on his face.

“Qin Yu, you’d better go all out next. Otherwise... you won’t have a chance to resist!”

Han Wei shouted and suddenly disappeared. In the blink of an eye, he was in front of Qin Yu!

When facing such an attack, Qin Yu didn’t dare to be negligent. He quickly raised his arms to protect his forehead!

“Dong!”

This punch landed solidly on Qin Yu’s arm. The tremendous force caused Qin Yu’s body to slide on the ground for dozens of meters!

Not only that, but the golden light on Qin Yu’s arm was pierced through, and numerous burn wounds appeared on his body!

Qin Yu lowered his head to look at his own arm and said in a deep voice, “As expected of a young master from an aristocratic family. As expected, he isn’t someone that an ordinary half-step Martial Marquis can compare to.”

With just one punch, he had pierced through Qin Yu’s Saintly Body Technique. This level of strength was enough to beat most half-step Martial Marquises!

“Qin Yu, this is only the beginning. Enjoy it!” Han Wei roared angrily, and once again, he approached!

It had to be said that Han Wei’s speed and strength had reached the max. Even Qin Yu was pushed back in succession!

Han Wei’s fist, which was wrapped in red light, was like red rain that kept crashing down!

“Well done!”

On the stage, Yan Sihai nodded his head in satisfaction.

“That’s it, kill him as soon as possible!” Xia Hang also hurriedly shouted.

He was very afraid that Qin Yu would suddenly start to counterattack.

It seemed that Qin Yu was being suppressed and was unable to retaliate.

“What kind of spell is this? It’s so strange,” Chu Heng said with a frown.

Yan Jinyao, who had been silent the whole time, said indifferently, “It is probably a secret spell passed down by the Han family. I’ve seen the library of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association before, but I’ve never seen this kind of spell.”

“Boom!!”

At this moment, Han Wei’s fierce fist suddenly smashed into Qin Yu’s chest.

Qin Yu’s body flew dozens of meters away, and he spat out a mouthful of blood!

“Hahaha!”

Seeing this, Han Wei couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

He looked coldly at Qin Yu and said, “Is this your strength? Is this the result of your painstaking cultivation?!”

“The bottom class will always be the bottom class. An ant will always be an ant. There will never be a chance to turn things around!”

Looking at Han Wei’s unhinged expression, Qin Yu still didn’t show any panic on his face.

He slowly stood up from the ground and grinned. “Han Wei, is this your full strength? It’s just so-so.”

Han Wei’s eyes suddenly narrowed and he said coldly, “What did you say?”

“I said... you’re weaker than I thought.” Qin Yu crossed his arms in front of his chest and looked calm.

“Sharp-tongued brat, let’s see if you can still smile after I step on you!” Han Wei roared angrily and approached once again!

Under the wrapping of the red light, Han Wei’s strength reached the max and even his physical body became indestructible!

Before his fist even arrived, the terrifying fist wind had already lifted the ground several feet!

“Die!” Han Wei roared repeatedly. The red color on his fist condensed to its peak!

“Han Wei, I will also let you know... that your family background isn’t worth mentioning at all!” Qin Yu’s icy cold voice entered Han Wei’s ears.

Just as his fist was about to smash into Qin Yu’s body, Qin Yu’s internal qi suddenly soared!

His eyes turned blood-red, and the mark of the Divine Dragon Power appeared between his brows!

“Oh no!” Sensing the huge change in Qin Yu’s internal qi, Han Wei suddenly felt that something was wrong!

Boom!

A golden light streaked across. Qin Yu activated the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist in his hand, and a terrifying power poured down!

Both fists collided violently at this moment!

At a glance, the golden and red lights had already covered the two figures. One could only see two lights fighting each other!

“Rumble...”

A terrifying surge of internal qi swept over!

There was incessant buzzing at the venue, and the entire small mountain seemed like it was about to collapse!

“All Martial Marquises present, please protect the venue together!” Martial Marquis Bai shouted loudly!

For a moment, several Martial Marquises hurriedly activated their spells to stabilize the venue!

“Boom!!”

At the center of the light, an explosive sound was heard!

Following that, a figure was seen retreating backwards!

Everyone’s eyes widened, as if they wanted to see clearly who the person who was sent flying was!

“That person is... Han Wei!” Someone shouted in shock!

As expected, Han Wei’s figure shot out rapidly before smashing into a small hill!

Many bloody marks appeared on his body, and he began to cough up blood.

This blood, mixed with his red light, looked somewhat creepy!

“How is this possible?!” Above, Han Meng suddenly stood up and stared at this scene!

“Han Wei, let’s settle the score between you and me today!” Qin Yu roared angrily, and the internal qi on his body completely exploded. His spiritual power rose to the max!

His hair flapped wildly, and he walked over with an imposing and invincible posture that was even more terrifying!

“Is this Qin Yu’s full strength?” Not far away, Zhuang Teng narrowed his eyes slightly, as if he felt a trace of pressure.

“If this kid doesn’t die, he will definitely become our great enemy in the future,” a genius from an aristocratic family said in a deep voice.

At this moment, a golden ray of light suddenly shot out and headed straight for Han Wei.

The huge golden figure came with a suppressive force and smashed into Han Wei’s body.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

Qin Yu’s every punch seemed to contain his confidence and powerful will to win, and all the grudges were vented at this moment!

Countless crisp sounds came from between the two of them, and Han Wei was knocked back repeatedly. Even the red light on his body dimmed by a few degrees!

The venue was completely silent, as if no one dared to believe what was happening.

The dignified Young Master Han had actually been beaten up by someone from the lower ranks?! How was this possible?!

“Son!” Han Meng, his eyes revealing a trace of worry, stood up angrily.

Yan Sihai, who was standing beside him, had a livid expression on his face. Clenching his fists, he said coldly, “Fortunately, I was prepared.”

“Don’t worry, Han Wei won’t lose!” Xia Hang hurriedly explained.

Yan Sihai glanced at him coldly and didn’t say anything, as if he was considering whether to kill Qin Yu or not.

“Is Han Wei going to lose?” Zhuang Teng said with some surprise.

Yan Jinyao glanced at him and said, “If it was so simple, then this big battle wouldn’t have been hyped up for so long.”

He looked at the battlefield quietly, as if waiting for something.

“Enough!”

At this moment, Han Wei suddenly shouted!

“Qin Yu, I’m going to kill you!” Han Wei quickly retreated. He was covered in blood, and his expression was ferocious!

Then, Han Wei raised his hands, as if he was condensing some spell!

“Rumble...”

A thunder-like sound came from the sky, and then, a blood-red sharp blade appeared in the air!

This sharp blade seemed to come from the sky, and an extremely majestic aura spread out!

“Han Xiu’s Full Moon Demon Blade,” Yan Jinyao said in a deep voice.

“I’ve heard of it too. It’s said that this is a Divine Rank spell that can cut down everything in the world!” Zhuang Teng also said in surprise.

“Han Xiu? Han Wei’s uncle?” Chu Heng said in surprise.

“Yes, he’s ranked third on the list.” Yan Jinyao nodded slightly.

“I’ve seen this spell before, and I almost died under it.” At this moment, another young man walked over from the side.

Seeing this young man, the few of them were a little surprised.

This man’s name was Kong Yun, and his father was Kong Luo, who was second only to Ye Qing and Jiang He!

“Brother Kong, is this technique that powerful?” Zhuang Teng asked in surprise.

Kong Yun nodded and said, “Among those of the same level, I don’t think anyone can survive this technique.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“I really didn’t expect that Han Wei would be forced to such an extent.”
