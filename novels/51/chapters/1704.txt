Chapter 1705: Chapter 1705: heading to the northern lands Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Every time someone asked, Xiao Sheng’s answer was only one: I am also cultivating.

This was a cultivation method that was difficult to understand. It seemed to be incompatible with the world.

…

Qin Yu stayed in front of the big graves for three whole days. Only after he had completely absorbed all the dark energy in the big graves did he get up and leave.

After leaving the Big Graves, Qin Yu planned to go back to the Big Yue Mountain to visit Wen Wanyi and the others and ask him for information.

On the way back, Qin Yu passed by an inn.

While drinking tea in the inn, he accidentally heard the gossip of the people.

“Have you heard? The Dead River will disappear in less than five days.”

“Yeah, it seems that the South Province will not stop.”

“Heh, you’re wrong. There are so many top-notch martial artist in the southern region now. Why would we be afraid of the Northern Region?”

“That’s right. Previously, it was because we were unable to cross the Dead River. Now, things are different. I heard that the elementalist has yet to awaken.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly when he heard this news.

He put down the things in his hands and quickly left the place.

The route that he had originally planned to take to the great Yue mountain was also changed to the Heavenly Cloud sect.

He arrived at the Heavenly Cloud sect all the way.

This time, surprisingly, Xiao Sheng did not stay at the Cultivation Mountain.

He sat in a courtyard at the back of the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s mountain, admiring the setting sun in the sky.

Under the lead of the Deputy Sect Master, Qin Yu came to this courtyard.

Seeing Xiao Sheng sitting there, Qin Yu did not say a word and directly sat beside him.

Neither of them said anything. They just quietly looked at the sky until the sun set.

The sky gradually darkened. Xiao Sheng’s gaze finally landed on Qin Yu.

This time, it was Xiao Sheng who was surprised.

He smiled and said, “Why don’t you ask anything?”

Qin Yu spread his hands and said, “If I don’t ask, you should be able to guess it. I Won’t waste my breath.”

Xiao Sheng shook his head and said, “I really didn’t guess it this time.”

“Really?”Qin Yu was a little surprised.

Xiao Sheng suddenly laughed out loud and said, “Of course it’s fake!”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “Every time I see you, you always make me feel extremely speechless.”

Xiao Sheng smiled faintly and then said seriously, “You want to go to the northern land?”

“Yes.”This time, Qin Yu was not too surprised.

“The Death River is going to disappear. It will be gone in less than five days,”Qin Yu continued.

Xiao Sheng glanced at qin yu and said, “Then why did you look for me?”

Qin Yu said, “I want to ask you for advice on how to go to the North Quietly.”

“The elementalists have not recovered yet. I think the north will be extremely cautious.”

Xiao Sheng nodded slightly and said, “However, I think that the northern border will be extremely chaotic when I think of that day. Conflict is inevitable.”

“As for how you should go to the northern lands, it’s up to you.”

Qin Yu thought for a moment, and it seemed to make sense.

The South region’s anger towards the northern lands had already accumulated for too long.

Moreover, the death river had existed for so many years. Now that it had suddenly disappeared, who knew how many people would go and watch.

Once the people from both sides met, conflict was unavoidable.

In this way, there were many more opportunities.

“Think carefully. Going to the northern lands is an extremely dangerous thing. There, you won’t be able to display 30% of your peak strength,”Xiao Sheng reminded.

Qin Yu acknowledged and said, “I’ve thought about it, so I can’t reveal my identity.”

“Okay.”Xiao Sheng didn’t say much.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something and continued to ask, “I need a huge container, a huge container that can carry dark energy.”

“That thing isn’t hard to come by, but I don’t have it here,”Xiao Sheng said.

Qin Yu suddenly thought of sister Lin and Gu City.

That place was connected in all directions, and it was close to the Green Rock Forest. Such a treasure shouldn’t be too difficult.

Moreover, it had been a long time since he had visited them, so he might as well take this opportunity to go.

Therefore, Qin Yu stood up and patted his butt, saying, “I’m leaving.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and left.

At this moment, Xiao Sheng’s leisurely voice came from behind.

“Don’t be too hasty in everything,”Xiao Sheng said.

Qin Yu paused his footsteps. He didn’t say anything and turned around to leave.

When Qin Yu arrived at Gu City, it was already three days later.

There were only a few days left before the death river completely disappeared.

In this short period of time, many people had already started to gather towards the border.

Many people stood on the side of the Death River, quietly looking at the other side, feeling the coldness coming from the other side.

Because the death river was too narrow, the distance between it and the northern lands had become very close. It was only a meter or so away, no different from face to face.

The weaker ones hid behind, while the stronger ones, who had foul mouths, stood a meter or two away and cursed at the northern lands cultivators. For a time, it became a strange scene.

…

Gu City.

Qin Yu found the city lord.

After the incident last time, Gu city was no longer as prosperous as before, and this palace looked even more dilapidated. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Qin Yu and the city Lord of Gu City sat in front of a chessboard. The two of them chatted while playing chess.

“I’ve already sent someone to find sister Lin. She should be here soon,”said the city lord.

Qin Yu nodded and then said, “There’s something I need to trouble you with.”

“Oh? Can I still be of service to you?”The city Lord said half-jokingly and half-seriously.

Qin Yu put down the chess piece in his hand and then said, “I need a container to carry the aura, internal QI, or dark energy.”

The city Lord didn’t think much about it. He nodded and said, “How big do you need?”

“The bigger the better, the faster the better,”Qin Yu said.

The city lord nodded. With a wave of his hand, a general of Gu City walked over.

Then, the city Lord gave him some instructions, and he hurriedly walked out.

“Thank you,”Qin Yu said.

With that, Qin Yu’s divine sense swept over the city lord.

He was surprised to find that the city Lord had already stepped into the half-step reversion void stage, and his strength had greatly increased.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and took out two drops of dragon blood.

One of the drops was intended for sister Lin, and the other one was given to the city lord.

“This thing might be able to help you step into the reversion void stage,”Qin Yu said.

The city Lord took the small bottle. He looked at the drop of dragon blood and said, “What is this?”

“Don’t ask. In short, using it to refine medicine has great benefits,”Qin Yu said.

The city lord smiled and said, “Then I will respectfully accept your request.”

As he spoke, sister Lin rushed back from outside.

She walked all the way to the two of them and bowed to the city lord. Then, she walked quickly to Qin Yu.

During this period of time, sister Lin had gone through something unknown. She looked a little more charming. Her clothes were also very different from before.

At first glance, she looked like a charming young woman.
