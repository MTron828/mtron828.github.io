Chapter 1728: Escape Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

While Xiao Sheng was resting on Cultivation Mountain, news of this legendary battle had already spread throughout the entire Nanzhou.

Xiao Sheng managed to kill a Reversion Void Stage cultivator as a half-step Reversion Void Stage cultivator. Such a feat was truly admirable!

“I knew it. It seems Xiao Sheng is still as domineering as he was in the past!”

“It seems that Yuan Xiu isn’t so bada*s after all, haha.”

“Qu Zhu and Wen Wanchong were the last to step in, yet it was also extremely crucial. Without them, I’m afraid Nanzhou would be in danger.”

!!

The crowd joined in a heated discussion.

Right at this moment, Xiao Sheng suddenly opened his eyes and sat up cross-legged.

He had a bad feeling about this.

“Yuan Xiu?” These two words came out of Xiao Sheng’s mouth. Then, he suddenly stood up and left Cultivation Mountain. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Not long after, Yuan Xiu arrived at Tianyun Sect again.

However, he kept a low profile this time. He only released his divine sense in Tianyun Sect to search for Xiao Sheng.

“He’s actually not here?” Yuan Xiu frowned.

He looked around and was silent for a moment. In the end, he decided to return to North Plain for the time being.

It was now in North Plain.

This clone of Yuan Xiu was currently staring coldly at He Teng, Sima Bei, and the other Yuan Xiu.

“Xiao Sheng must die,” after a while, Yuan Xiu coldly spluttered.

Sima Bei and the others looked taut, not daring to say a word.

The strength that Xiao Sheng had displayed today had already made them feel fear, and even Yuan Xiu felt the same.

“Go to Nanzhou now. Do whatever you can to find Xiao Sheng,” Yuan Xiu said coldly.

At this moment, Yong Ji suddenly said, “We can consider using others to bump him off. Didn’t Xihuang say that they were going to get rid of Nanzhou?”

Yuan Xiu narrowed his eyes and looked at Yong Ji.

After a moment of silence, he said, “Sure. You go to Xihuang. Sima Bei and He Teng will go to Nanzhou to find Xiao Sheng.”

“Yes.” The three of them nodded in unison.

Yong Ji couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief.

He’d never want to set foot in Nanzhou again.

Even if he did find Xiao Sheng, he was worried he would be killed.

Thus, the three of them split up and left North Plain.

…

It was now in Xihuang.

Qin Yu was waiting for the old man in the teahouse.

Soon, the old man walked into the teahouse with Chao Shou.

The two of them walked all the way to Qin Yu and sat down opposite him.

Seeing the old man, Qin Yu slightly bowed as a greeting.

Then, the old man pointed at Chao Shou, who was beside him, and said with a smile, “Qin Yu, if you have anything you want to know, you can ask him. He knows Pilgrimage City very well.

“Thank you.” Qin Yu nodded.

“Then I’ll leave you alone. You two take your time,” the old man said with a smile.

After saying this, the old man turned around and left.

After he left, Chao Shou looked at Qin Yu and said indifferently, “I take it you want to know how cultivation works in Pilgrimage City, right?”

Qin Yu said yes and continued, “I didn’t sense any rich spiritual energy after I came to Xihuang. It’s hard to produce many Return To Void Stage cultivators in such an environment in a short time.”

“Why do you want to know all this?” Chao Shou asked with a hint of amusement.

Qin Yu didn’t try to hide it. He smiled and said, “To be honest, I came to Xihuang to find dark energy.”

“How do you know that there is dark energy in Xihuang? Why is there dark energy here?” Chao Shou half smiled and asked.

Qin Yu frowned.

He suddenly felt that the man in front of him was a little strange, but he could not put his finger on it yet.

“I heard it from others but I didn’t see it in Pilgrimage City,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

After saying that, Qin Yu glanced at Chao Shou and found that there was no dark energy circulating in Chao Shou’s body.

“I think I might have come to the wrong place. It seems that Pilgrimage City doesn’t need dark energy,” Qin Yu said.
