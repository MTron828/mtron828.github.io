Chapter 2423 The Power of Backlash

“So Evil Eye is actually a hot potato? People from the human race will surely snatch it. At the same time, some higher-ups will be worried that this sword will fall into the hands of the ghost race, and the ghost race will go all out to obtain this sword.”

Ji Yue understood Flower Granny’s unspoken implication. Simply put, one might face unwarranted harm due to the desire of others.

“That’s right!”

Flower Granny nodded.

“Qin Yu, lend me the Heart of Thunder.”

Lei Xin did not dwell on Flower Granny’s topic. He had been gazing at the Five Great Emperors since he entered the Sumeru Realm and seemed to have noticed something strange.

He turned into a bolt of lightning and entered the Heart of Thunder. In an instant, the sound of a massive electric arc rang out in the Sumeru World.

Lei Xin’s consciousness turned into hundreds of thousands of tiny divine thunders. These divine thunders moved among the five emperors like tadpoles. Some divine thunders entered the enormous figure as if looking for something.

All of a sudden, wisps of black mist were emitted from the heads of the Five Emperors.

There was not much mist, but the entire Sumeru Realm was filled with a nauseating smell.

The Five Great Emperors’ bodies released countless evil curse energy.

His Glazed Holy Body slightly touched it, and the skin immediately decayed. The power even penetrated his body, turning his bones pitch-black.

This internal qi was the most evil and cursed energy Qin Yu had ever seen. The curse power of Ji Yuyi’s puppet doll was not even one or two-tenth of it.

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically, and he teleported everyone ten thousand meters away.

Wang Feng also fully activated the formation that sealed the internal qi attempting to isolate the sinister power of the curse.

However, these ancient formations could not stop it in the slightest.

The power that was emitted went past the people and slowly surged into Qin Yu’s body.

“Qin Yu, use the power of thunder and lightning to restrain these things!”

Lei Xin roared. The Heart of Thunder entered Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness again.

Qin Yu’s divine sense moved, and the power of thunder and lightning suddenly descended. It instantly penetrated his entire body which then bathed in a massive divine thunder.

“Qin Yu, expel this power with me.”

Lei Xin transformed into a thunder dragon and entered Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness. Together with Qin Yu, they fought against the power of the utmost sinister curse.

“Nine Heaven Divine Thunder! Second level!”

Two thunderclouds of different colors slowly appeared above Qin Yu’s head.

Amid the massive divine might, two enormous thunderbolts suddenly merged in the air and pierced through Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

The divine thunder slowly refined traces of curse power. After nearly two hours, the sinister power of the curse was finally refined.

However, there was still a trace of it in his body that could not be completely expelled, no matter what.

These powers were deeply rooted in Qin Yu’s soul as if they wanted to merge into one with him.

Dean Lei returned to their side. His face was almost bloodless as if he had used up all his spiritual energy.

“Dean Lei, take a fruit.”

Qin Yu hurriedly handed over a green spirit fruit.

After a while, Lei Xin looked better, and he pondered for a moment before speaking.

“Despite Five Emperor Coins being called Five Emperors, they aren’t auspicious items. The ancestors of the Ji family had once used this item to curse and kill countless people, and the curse also killed the Great Xia Royal Family. Using this extremely evil sorcery will naturally result in a backlash. This includes the enormous backlash of the curse, which I forced out from the surface of the sinister energy just now.”

Lei Xin stared at the Five Great Emperors with solemnness in his eyes.

Even if the Five Great Emperors possessed righteous and noble energy, a massive backslash of karma had contaminated the cores of the Five Emperors after the Ji family used the power of the sorcerer tribe crazily.

In other words, the power of the backlash of the Five Emperor Coins would attack Qin Yu at any time.

Even the slightest bit of backlash from the sorcerer tribe’s power was enough to threaten Qin Yu.

“Then can we give up on the Five Emperor Coins? Don’t refine it anymore.”

Ji Yue, by the side, gave Qin Yu an idea.

“After Qin Yu exterminated the Ji family, this karma had already bound his soul. Otherwise, Qin Yu wouldn’t have been able to refine the Five Emperor Coins so easily.”

Lei Xin shook his head.

“Is there no other way?” Ji Yue smiled bitterly. They had just witnessed this power up close and knew how terrifying it was.

“The power of the sorcerer tribe is obscure and difficult to understand. Moreover, the power of the sorcerer tribe’s Path of Heaven emphasizes the cycle of karma. I’m afraid it will still affect you even if you give up the Five Emperor Coins.”

Lei Xin tried his best to think of a solution, but Flower Granny did not seem as worried as him.

“The path of cultivation is as innumerable as the number of stars. Although the power of karma backlash is difficult to resolve, it is also a terrifying force. For you, it may be a preordained destiny, especially fortune and misfortune. This time, the fact that you could use the Netherworld Mind Technique to restrain the Ji family and exterminate them was indeed unimaginable. As for the matter that Lei Xin mentioned, there’s no need to worry about it since we can’t solve it now.”

Qin Yu’s emotions eased up significantly after hearing Flower Granny’s words. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Flower Granny and Lei Xin stayed in the Sumeru Realm and did not leave immediately. Instead, they discussed the Dao with Qin Yu until late at night.

The two could see the root of many problems in cultivation. They solved much confusion in cultivation in a mere short night.

Qin Yu’s thoughts also shocked the two.

“To be honest, I also can’t predict your future ultimately, but I think you will reach a stage we can’t imagine. I hope you don’t die halfway, brat.”

Lei Xin said seriously.

In the entire universe, living beings were not just billions. How could there be a lack of geniuses?

Many talented and intelligent people had turned into a pile of yellow soil in an instant.

Only those who survived would have the chance to stand at the peak.

…

“Ruoxue… I’m missing you.”

After the two left, Qin Yu stood under the starry sky and looked at the mountain peak where Ruoxue was in a daze.

Ruoxue had already left the Yan family, and they had already passed the most difficult stage.

However, after his narrow escape on Peach Blossom Island, he seemed to particularly miss Yan Ruoxue today.

“Here you go! Let’s drink!”

Jue Wu came to Qin Yu’s side and handed him a pot of wine.

“Alright, cheers!”

…

At noon the following day, the disciples of Thunder Courtyard came to Demon-slaying Peak to report that someone wanted to see Qin Yu.

Qin Yu was a little puzzled. When he saw the person who came, his face revealed a look of surprise.

“Senior Jiang He, Yao Meng, long time no see.”

“Just call me Jiang He. There’s no need to address me ‘Senior’!” Jiang He laughed heartily.

“Hahaha, alright, Big Brother Jiang He!”

Jiang He had given Qin Yu great help on Earth and even taught Qin Yu his secret techniques.

The three found a place and sat down. Qin Yu could not help but feel a little emotional. It had been nearly 200 years since he came to the Holy Region from Earth.
