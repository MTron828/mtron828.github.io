2162 Stepping into the Starry Sky

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I want the coordinates of Earth.”

Dean Lei seemed not surprised. He did not even ask much and immediately nodded in agreement.

“Speaking of which, coincidentally, I have the coordinates,” Dean Lei said. “Wait here for a while.”

Although Qin Yu was somewhat puzzled, he did not ask further.

Since Dean Lei knew his father, it was not surprising that he knew the coordinates of Earth.

Dean Lei’s figure instantly disappeared. In a short while, he reappeared in front of Qin Yu.

He sent a ray of golden light into Qin Yu’s mind. Soon, the coordinates of Earth and even the route appeared in Qin Yu’s mind.

It was a thin golden thread sketching a path in Qin Yu’s mind. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, Qin Yu finally realized how far away this place was from Earth. It was so far that it was unbelievable.

“This trip… I’m afraid it’ll take many years,” Qin Yu frowned and said.

Back then, even a minor sect like Tianyun Sect could reach Earth. Now, Thunder Courtyard could not do it. This could not help but make Qin Yu feel somewhat suspicious.

However, he did not ask any further. Time was of the essence, and it was time to set off.

“It is really unexpected that I have to leave like this. I don’t even have the time to bid farewell…” Qin Yu could not help but laugh bitterly.

Dean Lei patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “This’s considered the best outcome. You should feel glad that you’re still alive now. Besides, no one knows if this trip is a blessing or a curse.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. What Dean Lei said was true. It was already fortunate enough that he was alive.

“Dean Lei, I still have to trouble you with one more thing,” Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said.

“Say goodbye to Jue Wu on your behalf?” Dean Lei said with a smile.

“How did you know?” Qin Yu asked in surprise.

“Jue Wu thinks highly of you, so how could you not say goodbye to her?” Dean Lei stroked his beard and smiled.

Speaking up to this point, Dean Lei sighed with emotion and said, “Speaking of which… If Jue Wu knows about this… She’ll definitely go crazy.”

“Yes, so I’ll have to trouble you to keep an eye on her. Her personality…” Qin Yu did not finish speaking, but what he meant was obvious.

“Don’t worry. As long as I’m around, I won’t let anyone hurt her,” Dean Lei nodded and said.

“Thank you very much.”

Qin Yu thanked Dean Lei again before turning around and boarding the warship.

Activated by Qin Yu, the warship slowly began to rise into the air. A terrifying internal qi instantly filled the entire open space.

Qin Yu stood on the deck, and his long robe fluttered in the wind. His gaze was firm and profound. He could feel the immense power brought by the warship, and yearning and determination for the unknown world filled his heart.

The warship glided through the clouds, resembling a dazzling star piercing the night sky. Everything was changing rapidly. Qin Yu watched as the land below gradually moved further away. The buildings and mountain ranges that were as small as ants shrank gradually in his eyes. The lofty clouds were pierced through as the warship advanced, revealing the profound night sky adorned with sparkling stars, creating a mesmerizing spectacle in front of his eyes.

The warship sped up and streaked across the sky like a shooting star. It passed through the galaxy, shining with a golden light. The wind blew past Qin Yu’s face, bringing a cold feeling. He reached out and touched it as if he could feel the pulse of the universe and the existence of the boundless stars.

Soon, Qin Yu could no longer see anything. The warship entered the void. At a glance, endless darkness filled the surroundings.

Looking into the distance, he could see faint glimmers of light emanating from the stars that shined dimly.

They were like distant lighthouses, guiding the direction of the warship. Qin Yu stared at those stars, imagining the galaxies and the existence of life they represented. He could not help but fall into deep thought.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s emotions were tremendously complicated. He could not imagine leaving the Holy Region just like this. He did not know when he would meet those old friends again.

A hundred years might not mean much to cultivators, but in Golden Age, no one knew what would happen in a hundred years.

The warship continued to fly, passing through galaxies and nebulae, shuttling through the vast universe. Each leap brought a sense of awe and astonishment. Qin Yu saw the colorful galaxies, the strange landscape of the planets, and the diverse life forms. Some planets were surrounded by brilliant halos, while some galaxies emitted mysterious energy fluctuations.

Time became blurry in the universe. Qin Yu could no longer accurately sense the passage of time. He was immersed in the wonders of the universe, touching endless possibilities and unknown secrets.

Right at this moment, a tremendously gigantic warship suddenly appeared not far away, blocking Qin Yu’s way.

This warship was tremendously massive, like a moving mountain. Its pitch-black hull emitted a dense internal qi. Its appearance was like a gigantic beast, and its bow was carved with a ferocious face as if it could open its bloody mouth at any time to tear apart any existence that dared to stop it.

The surface of the warship was covered with a hard black-gold alloy, which flickered with a cold light, giving off an unshakable sense of firmness. Mysterious runes and ancient totems were carved all over the ship, giving off a majestic and ancient internal qi.

The dragon-like structure that extended from the hull was like a massive skeleton that supported the entire warship.

These dragon bones flickered with weak energy fluctuations like a sleeping giant beast that had awakened and emitted a majestic internal qi.

Qin Yu frowned slightly, and he suddenly felt an ominous premonition in his heart.

The entire warship blocked Qin Yu’s way. Immediately, two elderly men appeared on the deck.

The two had cold expressions and extraordinary internal qi. Their gray robes were embroidered with strange patterns, and their gazes were sharp and cold as if they could see through people’s hearts and everything.

One of the elderly men was tall and had broad shoulders and a broad back like an iron tower. His hair was completely white, but his gaze was still as sharp as a knife, emitting a domineering aura. He held a black magic staff with a blood-red gem embedded in it, emitting a powerful internal qi of death.

The other elderly man was short but exuded a pressure that could not be ignored. His face was full of wrinkles, revealing the traces of time, but his gaze was unusually sharp as if hiding endless wisdom.

“Qin Yu, we have been waiting for a long time!” an elderly man said coldly.

“Do you really think you can leave the Holy Region alive?” another person mocked and said.

“That fool, Yan Tianshi, actually let you go. He’s really old and muddle-headed!”

“He’s foolish, but we’re not. Qin Yu, you won’t be able to escape death!”

The internal qi of the two elderly men spread out in the starry sky, bringing with them a formidable pressure that made Qin Yu feel like he was in an unavoidable predicament.

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly. He looked at the two and said in a low voice, “I knew it! There would be villains blocking my way!”
