Chapter 1107: Chapter 1,107, I Want Half! 

Qin Yu had the pill formula for New Year’s Day.

This pill formula was actually not a rare item. It was just that to refine this pill, one needed top-notch pill skills. There were not many people in the world who could refine this pill.

In the current era, there was no accurate division of ranks among alchemists. However, Qin Yu had powerful divine sense and purple fire, so he was quite confident in himself.

Qin Yu followed the pill formula and put the herbs into the cauldron. Then, he slowly refined the pill with the purple spiritual fire.

To refine the heavenly essence pill, it was very important to control the temperature of the flame. This required a powerful divine sense.

Golden Light shot out from Qin Yu’s glabella, and primordial spirit power burst out, refining the pill with great precision.

As the herbs melted one by one, the medicinal fragrance slowly spread out.

Qin Yu’s mind moved. He threw the strange flower into it and began the most important step.

His control of fire power was extremely precise and skilled. Anyone who looked at him would look like a veteran alchemist.

Even Yun Long, who was beside him, couldn’t help but be slightly stunned.

The slumbering mighty figure also floated out of the valley with a strand of primordial spirit, looking down at Qin Yu from above.

“This pill art might not be considered top-notch in the holy region, but in this world, it is definitely second to none,”the Almighty commented.

Flames burned within the cauldron, sometimes large and sometimes small. Every step was calculated, and no mistakes could be made.

Even with Qin Yu’s powerful divine sense, he still seemed to be having some trouble.

Time passed by minute by minute, and the medicinal liquid within the cauldron began to condense into form.

This was the final and most important step.

Yun long and that mighty figure held their breaths, afraid that they would disturb Qin Yu.

After another half an hour, the cauldron began to emit thick smoke!

“Bang!”

Following a loud sound, pill clouds began to condense in the sky!

“It’s taking shape.”That mighty figure couldn’t help but feel somewhat excited.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He continued to control the flames and proceed with the final step.

Thick smoke rose in all directions and was emitted from the medicinal cauldron.

Such thick smoke directly blocked one’s vision.

Even mighty figures were unable to penetrate this smoke.

At the same time, Qin Yu opened his eyes.

He put away the flames and looked at the medicinal cauldron.

“It’s done,”Qin Yu said.

“It’s formed?”The mighty figure asked.

Qin Yu acknowledged and said, “Once the smoke dissipates, it will be over.”

The Almighty did not say anything as he quietly looked at the medicinal cauldron.

Qin Yu’s eyes were also staring at the medicinal cauldron.

He was not sure if the pill refinement this time was successful. Although it had already taken shape, it did not mean that this was a successful pill.

The smoke began to slowly disperse, slowly revealing the bottom of the medicinal cauldron.

The three of them held their breaths as they looked at the medicinal cauldron somewhat nervously.

“Oh?”Yun long frowned. Then, he couldn’t help but laugh out loud. “You failed as expected. I knew you were bragging!”

The first thing that came into view was an incomplete heaven essence pill!

Clearly, this pill had failed!

The almighty expert hovering in mid-air couldn’t help but have a cold expression. He snorted coldly and said, “You still have two more chances.”

Qin Yu’s brows were tightly knitted.

He never expected that the refinement of this heavenly new year’s Day would actually fail.

“Just what exactly went wrong...”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice. His eyes couldn’t help but look at the medicinal cauldron.

“En?”

Right at this moment, Qin Yu’s eyes suddenly lit up, and a trace of joy instantly flashed across his face! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

He saw that under the smoke, there were two complete heavenly yuan pills!

“Success!”Qin Yu was instantly beyond excited!

This strange flower had refined two complete heaven essence pills, as well as an incomplete heaven essence pill!

In other words, Qin Yu had used a strange flower to refine three and a half heaven essence pills!

“Great, it has far exceeded my expectations!”Qin Yu shouted excitedly!

He immediately raised his head to look at that mighty figure and said, “How is it? Is there any problem?”

There was a faint hint of excitement in the eyes of this mighty figure.

He forcefully suppressed the excitement in his heart and said, “Not bad. It seems that you do have some ability.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Senior, you said that a stalk of strange flower that can refine a heavenly essence pill is enough, right?”

“That’s right.”The mighty figure nodded.

Qin Yu continued, “Then, if I refine a heavenly essence pill at a ratio of one to three, does that mean that I can obtain two?”

The mighty figure’s face instantly darkened.

He hovered in mid-air with his hands behind his back as he said, “Kid, aren’t you a little greedy?”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Isn’t that the reason?”

“You’re dreaming. Don’t forget that we’re the ones who provided this strange flower!”Yun long shouted from the side.

“Yun Long is right,”the almighty expert said indifferently.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Then what does senior mean?”

“You can obtain a heavenly essence pill from a strange flower,”the Almighty Expert said with a faint smile.

A faint smile hung on his face as if he was certain that Qin Yu would agree.

After all, without the strange flower, Qin Yu would not be able to obtain a single heavenly essence pill.

However, Qin Yu shook his head.

He sneered and said, “I won’t agree. Even if I can’t obtain two, I want to at least split them equally.”

“I can think of a way to let a strange flower refine three heavenly essence pills, but I want to take half.”

That Almighty’s expression instantly turned cold.

He narrowed his eyes and sized up Qin Yu, saying, “Kid, think carefully. If I don’t agree, you won’t get anything.”

Qin Yu also said, “Senior, please think carefully too. If I leave now, you won’t be able to get the heaven origin pills either.”

“There are very few people in the world who can refine heaven origin pills. Furthermore, the Holy Region will open in a month. If you can’t recover to Your Peak State, you will be in great danger.”

“After all, the flesh and blood of a mighty figure, as well as their primordial spirit, are extremely nutritious.”
