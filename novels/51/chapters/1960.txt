1961 All Parties Shaken

The matter continued to ferment, and soon it spread all over the world. Suddenly, it almost became the hottest news.

It had been a long time since the Si family was last defeated. Not to mention an unknown kid, they had never lost to any famous old experts.

But now, the Si family had been defeated by Qin Yu repeatedly. How could they not be shocked?

In the Si family, the entire family had heard about the matter.

!!

The head of the Si family was out on training now. Otherwise, he would have exploded in anger.

In front of Si Shifeng’s bed, a gray-haired elderly man stood with a gloomy expression.

The Semi-Saints that had been following him knelt on the ground.

“What a disgraceful thing!”

At this moment, the elderly man suddenly turned around, and his terrifying internal qi swept toward the Semi-Saints!

The Semi-Saints didn’t dare to resist it and vomited blood from the shock! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“As executives, you actually made such a stupid decision. Now the entire Si family has lost its face because of you!” the elderly man said coldly.

A Semi-Saint got up from the ground and said while trembling, “First Elder, this matter has exceeded our expectations. No one expected Young Master Feng to lose. I…”

“Shut up!” First Elder debuted.

“Holy Son wanted you to help secretly to ensure Young Master Feng would win and not kill people in broad daylight!

First Elder’s face was full of resentment. He wished he could beat these people to death.

The Semi-Saints didn’t dare to say a thing and could only kneel on the ground.

After a while, First Elder took a deep breath and said slowly, “Since Qin Yu has stolen our things, we must get them back.”

The Semi-Saints immediately understood.

“First Elder, we understand,” they suddenly stood up and said.

“But this matter must be done perfectly. No one should discover it,” Eldest Elder said coldly.

“The reputation of the Si family definitely cannot be tarnished again.”

“Yes!”

…

In the Yan family, Yan Ruoxue and Uncle Yan stood by the shore of Mount Donghuang.

“I truly didn’t expect him to defeat Si Shifeng,” Uncle Yan sighed and said.

“Qin Yu has never lost to anyone in the same cultivation realm,” Yan Ruoxue chuckled.

“It’s the chaotic body, after all,” Uncle Yan said. “However, I’m more curious about the magical artifact he has. How did he summon that person’s vision?”

Of course, Yan Ruoxue knew what Uncle Yan was talking about. She was silent for a long time but did not tell Uncle Yan at the end.

“Uncle Yan, that vision… Will it bring trouble to Qin Yu?” Yan Ruoxue suddenly asked.

Uncle Yan sighed and said, “Maybe, maybe not. After all, not many people knew about her now. Furthermore, a magical artifact can’t prove anything.”

“That’s good.” Yan Ruoxue heaved a sigh of relief.

“But…” At this moment, Uncle Yan suddenly changed the subject.

He looked at Yan Ruoxue and said, “It’s possible If someone wants to make a big deal out of it.”

Yan Ruoxue’s expression changed slightly as if she understood something.

Her expression was gloomy, and light flashed in her eyes. No one knew what she was thinking.

…

In Dean Lei’s room at Thunder Courtyard, a girl as petite as a child was tugging at Dean Lei’s beard.

If news of such a scene were to spread, it would definitely cause a huge commotion.

“I must leave Thunder Courtyard!” Jue Wu angrily saidly as she tugged at Dean Lei’s beard.

Dean Lei laughed bitterly and said, “Qin Yu has won. What else do you want?”

“That’s the Si family! How would the Si family let this matter rest?” Jue Wu said with her eyes wide.

“What can you do if the Si family really wants to make a move?” Dean Lei asked in return.

Jue Wu held her little hand and said fiercely, “Then I’ll beat them all into a pulp!”

“You think too highly of yourself,” Dean Lei shook his head and said. “Perhaps the Si family couldn’t do anything to you if they send out a Semi-Saint, but what about two or three?”

“I don’t care. I don’t want to listen to all that. I’m leaving now. If you disagree, I’ll pull off your beard!” Jue Wu said unruly.

She kept tugging at Dean Lei’s beard, who was helpless.

“It’s possible if you really want to leave Thunder Courtyard, but you have to bring a Saint Weapon,” Dean Lei sighed and said.

Hearing this, Jue Wu immediately jumped down from Dean Lei’s body.

She stretched out her palm and took out the Glided Rake.

“This is enough!” Jue Wu said proudly.

“No,” Dean Lei shook his head and said. “The Gilded Rake can’t unleash its true power in your hands. You need a real Saint Weapon to protect your life.

“Then give me one, and I’ll go now,” Jue Wu said anxiously.

Dean Lei rolled his eyes and said, “You have to use your points to exchange for it. This is the rule of Thunder Courtyard. No one can change it. If you continue making a fuss, I will lock you up.”

Seeing Dean Lei not seem to be joking, Jue Wu could only agree. “Alright. Isn’t it just points? Give me a few days, and I’m going to Demon-slaying Peak now!”

...

After saying this, Jue Wu disappeared without a trace.

Dean Lei was speechless. He could only shake his head repeatedly.

…

A full eight days.

Qin Yu finally woke up from his coma.

He opened his eyes, and the blue sky and white clouds were the first things he saw.

Qin Yu struggled to sit up from the ground and felt a sharp pain.

He lowered his head to look at his body, only to see it covered in blood and cracks.

Eight days was not enough to restore Qin Yu’s body. It was evident that his injuries could not be self-healed.

“The Si family will definitely not let me off.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

Although the surroundings looked safe, Qin Yu knew it was not a long-term solution.

...

It was only a matter of time before the Si family could find Qin Yu.

“Looks like I’ll have to find another place,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Thus he struggled to get up and slowly walked out of the forest.

Qin Yu didn’t know how long it had been before he finally arrived at a city.

Coincidentally, this city was the Yao family’s territory.

“The Yao family has been inviting me to join them. It seems to be a pretty good place to go now,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu rushed toward the city.

Qin Yu went straight to the city wall. He forced himself to be alert, bowed, and said, “I’m Qin Yu. I would like to see the City Lord. Please inform him.”

The two guards at the city gate looked at each other and said in surprise, “Qin Yu? The Qin Yu who defeated Si Shifeng recently?”

“Yes, I am.” Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief.

Fortunately, his reputation had spread even to such a remote city that people knew his name.
