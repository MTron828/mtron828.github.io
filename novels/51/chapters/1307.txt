Chapter 1308: Chapter 1,308, the chaotic battle had begun 

Qin Yu bowed repeatedly to express his gratitude.

Beside him, Wen Da’s eyes were wide open, as if he couldn’t believe the auctioneer’s attitude towards Qin Yu.

He opened his mouth to say something, but was dragged out by Qin Yu.

After leaving the auction, the first thing that came into view was a large area of desolation.

There were mottled traces of a great battle here. The ground was filled with potholes, as if announcing the great battle that had happened here before.

“Is that female auctioneer blind? She actually treated me this way, yet she was so kind to you. F * ck!”Wen Da cursed loudly.

Qin Yu stopped in his tracks and smiled, “She doesn’t even like you. Don’t waste your effort.”

“Then wouldn’t I have bought all these things for nothing!”Wen Da said in a huff.

Qin Yu felt somewhat lucky in her heart.

As an auction, she had handled countless treasures. Since she had agreed to him, it was likely that she would obtain the life force not far away.

Just as the few of them were conversing, Qin Yu suddenly felt an intense killing intent.

Turning around, he saw the old man who had bid for the Huangji Buddhic Flame walk out.

Behind him, countless pairs of eyes were staring at him.

Those eyes were like hungry wolves, making one’s heart tremble.

“As expected, a great battle can not be avoided.”Wen Da and Wen Er pulled Qin Yu to the side.

In front, there were already several people blocking the old man’s path.

“What do you mean by this?”The old man asked coldly.

“Hehe, fellow Daoist has bid for the Huangji Buddha Flame. We would like to admire it. May We?”

“That’s right. We are also quite interested in the Huangji Buddha Flame.”

The old man laughed loudly and said, “Admire it? If you want to kill people and steal their goods, you can just say so. Why beat around the Bush?”

Everyone narrowed their eyes. Someone took the lead and said with a cold smile, “Since that’s the case, we won’t waste any more words. Hand over the Huangji Buddha Flame and we’ll spare your life!”

The old man seemed to have expected this. He was not flustered and said with a faint smile, “With so many people, who should we give the Huangji Buddha Flame to?”

Clearly, this old man wanted to shift the conflict away.

“You don’t need to care about that. You just need to hand over Huangji Fo Yan. As for how we divide it, that’s our business,”someone said with a sneer.

The Old Man’s plan failed, and his face instantly turned cold.

“That will depend on your ability. It’s not that easy to snatch my things!”

The old man roared, and the internal Qi all over his body exploded like a cannonball!

This aura was extremely powerful, and it couldn’t help but make people pale with fright.

The entire earth was buzzing, and the auction hall behind them lit up. It was the Auction Hall’s mountain protection artifact that had been passively revived! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“What a powerful aura.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but take two steps back.

Even Ling Yun couldn’t compare to this old man’s strength!

This person’s strength had probably already surpassed the intermediate stage of the Almighty Realm!

As expected, I wouldn’t dare to bid for this item without some ability, Qin Yu thought to herself.

These people weren’t surprised when they felt the internal Qi from the old man’s body.

They looked at the old man coldly and said, “Old Man, we won’t leave until we get the Huangji Buddha Flame today.”

“Then, there’s no need to talk nonsense. Let’s do it!”

The old man took the lead and walked over. His internal Qi also surged.

His attack was extremely fast. His emaciated palm suddenly slapped one of the people’s forehead and directly cracked his skull!

Seeing this, the rest of the people no longer waited for death. They all took action and used their most powerful spells!

The entire scene turned into a battlefield. After all, they were not the same group of people. Each of them was secretly scheming. Therefore, this big battle quickly turned into a chaotic battle.

A terrifying aura kept spreading in all directions. These people came from all over the world and had deep internal Qi. Therefore, no one in Gu City made a move.

The collision of the internal Qi caused the sky to collapse and the earth to crack!

The earth was collapsing and the space was collapsing. Those who could not dodge in time were even injured by accident and died on the spot.

Even Qin Yu felt an intense pressure. Many of the residual power that shot over almost shattered his body. It was enough to witness the terrifying strength of these people!

Qin Yu reached out to protect Wen Dawen er, but he realized that the two of them had a glow on their bodies. It was enough to ignore the residual power.

After all, they were Wen Wanji’s beloved grandsons. They must have magical treasures on them.

The battle was still going on. The entire scene was covered by the glow and dust. However, Qin Yu relied on the desolate God’s eye and continued to look at the scene.

“These people... aren’t they too powerful?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but suck in a cold breath.

Such a scale was far beyond Qin Yu’s reach. Compared to his battle with Ling Yun, they were much more powerful!

As more and more mighty realm experts died on the scene, these top experts were like ants at this moment. They could die at any moment.

The more the old man fought, the more courageous he became. It was unknown how many people had died under his hands.

However, facing experts of the same realm, the old man couldn’t fight against four hands with two fists. Very quickly, he fell into a disadvantageous position.

His body was bleeding, but his face was still incomparably cold as he fought with all his might!

No one could imagine that a mighty realm expert would die so easily!

“As expected of a saint-level expert. So many mighty realm experts died in a single battle.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but exclaim in his heart.
