Chapter 1020: Chapter 1,020, three hundred disciples! 

While attacking the other sects, Qin Yu was also paying attention to the development of the fire country’s pyro world.

Qin Yu was also well aware of what was happening in the world of martial arts.

“Dog Bites Dog, a mouth hair.”Looking at He Teng Open Content, Qin Yu can not help but snort.

Never thought that the last to expose the face of Gu Xinghe, it will be he teng.

Qin Yu put away his phone and said in a cold voice: “We Shall Wait a few more days before we set off to return to the fire country.”

Towards the old enemies of the fire country, Qin Yu had long detested them to the extreme.

If it had not been for the pavilion master’s obstruction, the current gu xing he, and even the second mystic realm, would probably have already sunk into a corpse.

Fire Country, Pyro.

Under Gu Xing he’s orders, many ordinary martial artists had fallen into the hands of evil. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

He Teng also used this opportunity to desperately absorb the resources that belonged to him.

In just a few days, the reputation of the martial arts association in Jingdu was getting worse and worse.

Gu Xinghe’s wanton and reckless actions had already aroused the extreme dissatisfaction of the officials.

Even Gu Xinghe himself did not expect that his big game of chess would end up like this.

In the office, Gu Xinghe’s expression became crazier and crazier. His mind was completely twisted.

“Damn it, damn it! These people all deserve to die!”Gu Xinghe smashed everything in the office, recklessly venting his emotions.

Zhai Xing stood at the side, not saying a word.

“Why didn’t you kill that Qin Yu earlier!”Suddenly, Gu Xinghe pointed his spear at Zhai Xing!

He glared at Zhai Xing and said through gritted teeth, “If you had killed Qin Yu earlier, there wouldn’t be this mess!”

Zhai Xing still did not speak, allowing Gu Xinghe to spew vulgarities.

At this moment, the door was suddenly opened.

“Who let you in!”Gu Xinghe waved his hand and a ray of divine light slashed out!

However, this palm was easily neutralized.

When he clearly saw the face of the newcomer, Gu Xinghe’s expression changed drastically!

“Dad... Dad? Why are you here?”After seeing Gu Zizhen, Gu Xinghe obviously calmed down a lot.

He hurriedly bowed with a nervous and fearful expression on his face.

“Dad, I...”

“Alright, don’t say anything else. Go back to the second mystic realm. I’ll take care of things here,”gu Zizhen said coldly.

Gu Xinghe said somewhat unwillingly, “Dad, everything was going smoothly initially. I can resolve the situation now!”

“Resolve My A * s! If you don’t go back now, I’m afraid you won’t be able to go back!”Gu Zizhen said angrily!

Seeing that Gu Zizhen was really angry, Gu Xinghe didn’t dare to say anything.

Then, Gu Zizhen looked at Zhai Xing as if he wanted to say something, but in the end, he shook his head.

“All of You, come back with me,”Gu Zizhen said in a deep voice.

“What about the Martial Arts Association of Jingdu?”Zhai Xing asked.

Gu Zizhen pondered for a moment and said, “Let Xia hang handle it for now. Let’s go back and lay low for a while.”

The two of them did not say anything else.

That day, Gu Zizhen left the martial arts association of Jingdu with Gu Xinghe.

Not only that, the martial arts association of Jingdu also issued a statement saying that they would punish Gu Xinghe severely.

But everyone knew that the so-called severe punishment was nothing.

For a moment, the entire martial arts world was furious.

“He killed so many people and just left like that?”

“Why! We must make him give us an explanation!”

“If Gu Xinghe doesn’t die, we won’t Give Up!”

However, these complaints didn’t have any real effect.

No one could break into the second secret realm. Moreover, they didn’t have the strength to challenge the second secret realm.

Without the deterrence of the martial arts association of Jingdu, the disciples who walked out of the mystic realms became even more arrogant.

Among them, the disciples of the mystic realm represented by Qiao Zun were tyrannical in the martial arts world. No one could stop them!

The disciples of the crown prince not only had to face the threat of He Teng, but also had to bear the humiliation of the disciples of the Mystic Realm.

For a time, the martial arts world was filled with grief.

More and more people gathered on nine pinnacles mountain.

These people gathered here, hoping to receive the protection of Jiang he and Xu Huaigu.

In just a few days.

More than a hundred people had already gathered on nine pinnacles mountain.

Looking at these martial artists who came to ask for help, Chang Mang could not help but feel angry.

“Damn it, a bunch of ingrates, hurry up and get down the mountain!”Chang Mang’s eyes were as wide as copper bells, and his voice was like a loud bell, shaking people to the point of trembling.

“Treat us as the Saviors today, and F * cking turn on us tomorrow! I really want to kill all of you!”

Nearly a hundred people looked at each other, at a loss for words.

“Mr. Chang, you and Qin Yu are friends. Please send him a message, saying that we were blind and willing to apologize to him...”

“Right, right, right. Tell him that we all desperately hope that he can come back...”

“As long as he is willing to come back, we will apologize immediately!”

Hearing this, Chang Mang became even angrier.

He picked up a person’s collar and lifted him up into the air.

The anger in his heart seemed to be about to erupt from his fist.

“I will kill you first and then apologize to you, Alright!”Chang Mang gritted his teeth so hard that they were cracking.

“Now that no one cares about you, you want to F * cking call him back? How can you be so thick-skinned?”

Chang Mang’s rough palm was filled with an abyss-like killing intent.

He seemed to be trying his best to restrain himself.

“Forget it, they are also in the dark and don’t know the truth.”Xu Huaigu shook his head and said.

Chang Mang was filled with anger, but he had nowhere to vent it out. He could only raise his head and let out a long howl. Then, he ruthlessly threw that martial artist to the ground.

“You bunch of people deserve to F * cking die!”

Chang Mang threw down these words and turned around to leave.

This nine pinnacles mountain seemed to have become the only pure land, as well as the refuge of many martial artists.

Things had developed to this point, not to mention the martial dao resources, even their survival would be difficult.

Qiao Zun’s group had practically split up all the Martial Dao Resources they had.

Everyone dared to be angry, but they didn’t dare to say anything.

And thousands of kilometers away in the Heaven Gate Square, there were three hundred people gathered.

These three hundred people were the top experts that Qin Yu had carefully selected, and every one of them had been through hundreds of battles.

Their expressions were solemn, and their appearances were dignified, as if they were a well-trained team.

Qin Yu stood on the high platform in front of him, staring at the crowd.

A moment later, Qin Yu coldly said: “The three hundred of you, follow me back to the fire country, and set off immediately!”[1][2][2][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][3][4][4][4][4][4][4][4][4][4][4][4][4][4][4][4][4]
