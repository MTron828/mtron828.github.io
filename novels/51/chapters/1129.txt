Chapter 1130: Chapter 1,130, beheading a mighty figure! 

“Burning your blood essence? Do you think I’ll give you a Chance?”Qin Yu said coldly.

Taking advantage of his illness to take his life, how could Qin Yu allow him to step into the peak?

Tian Zong gritted his teeth and said, “In other words, you have to fight to the death with me!”

“No.”Qin Yu shook his head. “I have to kill you.”

“You’re going too far!”Tian Zong immediately raised his head and roared when he heard that!

He was unwilling to give up and once again escaped into the void. At the same time, he quickly took out a trace of blood essence from between his brows!

However, before the blood essence could burn, Qin Yu had already smashed his fist forward and once again jolted him out of the Void!

The second punch instantly caused Tian Zong to bleed in the sky!

He clutched his chest, gritted his teeth and said, “Qin Yu, you and I have no enmity, why must you kill me!”

Qin Yu sneered, “If I had not stepped into the middle stage of the Martial Saint Realm Today, would you have spared me?”

Tian Zong remained silent. He wanted to escape into the void for the third time, but this time, he failed.

Qin Yu extended his palm and raised it to unleash the seven sorrow palm!

A palm print flew towards Tian Zong, and the golden light instantly penetrated his body!

Tian Zong immediately retreated repeatedly, vomiting blood non-stop!

“Ah! !”Tian Zong cried out in grief and indignation, reverberating throughout the entire sky!

Tian Zong was unwilling! He was unwilling to die just like that!

“Qin Yu, you and I have no enmity, you...”Tian Zong opened his mouth, and suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood!

Then, his entire body fell from the air, and blood kept oozing out from the corner of his mouth, looking extremely painful.

Seeing his expression, Qin Yu could not help but frown.

“What trick are you playing again?”Qin Yu asked.

Tian Zong pointed at his chest and said, “Not good... This seal seems to have left an internal injury in my body...”

His internal Qi was rapidly disappearing, and his entire body became extremely weak.

“This seal... destroyed my foundation... Pu!”Tian Zong opened his mouth and spat out a mouthful of blood!

“Destroyed your foundation?”Qin Yu’s frown became tighter and tighter.

Looking at Tian Zong’s appearance, Qin Yu even felt pity for him.

He originally did not want to kill Tian Zong. After all, he did not kill a disciple of the Heaven Gate.

What made Qin Yu feel hateful was that he wanted to use Qin Yu for nothing and burn the bridge after crossing the river.

Looking at Tian Zong who was lying on the ground in pain, Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “You have already fallen into such a state. I will spare your life this time. But let me tell you, you’d better not provoke me in the future.”

“Definitely, definitely...”Tian Zong nodded repeatedly.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He turned around and planned to leave.

But at this moment, a trace of viciousness flashed in Tian Zong’s eyes.

The Moment Qin Yu turned around, Tian Zong suddenly exploded. Holding a snow-white sharp blade in his hand, he fiercely stabbed towards Qin Yu’s head!

“Go to hell!”Tian Zong roared angrily. All of his Qi energy gathered on this sharp blade

However, at this moment, Qin Yu suddenly turned around and threw a punch!

This punch was the ten thousand shattering technique created by Qin Yu himself! It was also the gathering of internal Qi!

“Boom!”

The huge collision instantly shattered the sharp blade in Tian Zong’s hand! Tian Zong’s body was penetrated by this golden light, and he fell to the ground!

Tian Zong stared at Qin Yu and said in a trembling voice, “You... You tricked me? !”

This punch had broken ten thousand laws. It was obvious that it had been formed long ago and was waiting for Tian Zong to make a move!

Qin Yu looked at Tian Zong coldly and said, “Do you think I believe you in front of you? You are a mighty figure, yet you did such a despicable thing as a sneak attack from behind. Aren’t you afraid of being laughed at? !”

At this time, Tian Zong was completely flustered. He said in fear, “Don’t... Don’t kill me, don’t kill me! I... I was possessed for a moment. I guarantee that I will never appear in front of you for the rest of my life!”

Qin Yu looked at Tian Zong coldly and said, “Do you think I will believe you again?”

“No... Don’t!”

Fear crawled all over Tian Zong’s old face.

But what greeted him was Qin Yu’s incomparably fierce fist.

The Crushing Qi energy transformed into a ray of light that was several feet wide.

The Ray of light gave birth to a scorching temperature. In an instant, it passed through Tian Zong’s body, emitting waves of crisp sounds.

Tian Zong’s body kept falling backwards. His internal organs were all affected, but his body still didn’t shatter.

This was the body of a mighty figure, incomparably tough!

Although Tian Zong had an ordinary physique, his body after stepping into a mighty figure still reached such a terrifying hardness!

Even Qin Yu’s full strength punch was unable to destroy his body.

“Weng!”

At this moment, a ray of golden light shot out from between Qin Yu’s brows!

This ray of light was like a dagger, easily entering between Tian Zong’s brows. That dagger-like ray of light directly shattered Tian Zong’s divine sense!

Tian Zong widened his eyes, disbelief written all over his eyes before he died.

He had never thought that the result of sealing his body for a thousand years for the sake of the holy region would be like this.

“Bang!”

Tian Zong’s body fell heavily to the ground.

A mighty figure of a generation had fallen just like that.

Qin Yu looked coldly at Tian Zong’s body. There wasn’t the slightest bit of pity in his eyes.

“You found this all by yourself,”Qin Yu said coldly. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The surroundings were completely silent. Half a second later, exclamations came from all directions like a tidal wave.

“Qin Yu... really killed a mighty figure! A genuine mighty figure...”

“Crossing realms to kill a mighty figure... he actually exists...”

“To be able to witness this scene with my own eyes, this life is not in vain.”

Qin Yu’s eyes scanned his surroundings.

He activated the desolate God’s eye and looked a thousand miles away!

In the darkness, there seemed to be a throbbing.

A hidden internal Qi retreated at this moment.

Qin Yu did not say anything.

He knew very well that since Tian Zong was able to wait for the holy region for several years, there must be other mighty figures who had used the same method.

After killing Tian Zong today, there should not be any other newly born mighty figures who would come to jinx him.

One punch was enough to prevent a hundred punches.
