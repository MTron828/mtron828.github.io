Chapter 2612: Blackie Beats Black Dragon

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The only thing he could do was to do his best to stall the black dragon.

Tiger Wing in his hands trembled slightly, emitting a deep hum of the blade.

He slashed out again. This time, Tiger Wing did not slash the black dragon.

However, a putrid flower of blood bloomed from where it rotted.

A one-meter-long gash appeared at that spot. However, it was not fatal compared to the black dragon’s nearly thirty-meter-long body.

The saber qi was Ju Wuwei’s own saber aura and had nothing to do with any order in this Saint Kingdom. It was also the most powerful saber attack he could currently unleash.

The black dragon roared, and a putrid breath spewed from its nostrils.

It covered the area where Ju Wuwei was, and he wielded his saber, creating a flurry of blade blossoms blocking the essential parts of his body.

The skin exposed on the outside slowly dissolved, revealing the blood-red flesh inside. Ju Wuwei’s internal qi weakened at a tremendous speed.

After spewing the putrid breath, the black dragon did not chase after him. Instead, it flapped its wings and soared into the sky.

It suddenly halted at an altitude of about 200 meters before suddenly diving down.

It actually used its strength and gravity to kill Ju Wuwei completely.

Ju Wuwei took a deep breath and placed the saber horizontally in front of him again.

He did not need to dodge because he simply could not dodge the black dragon in the air compared to the black dragon’s speed.

On the other end, while Ju Wuwei had just begun his battle with the black dragon…

Qin Yu also began his action. He and Shen Qian came to the black dragon’s corpse.

Giant ogre’s esophagus!

The rotten esophagus reappeared, and the black dragon’s corpse slowly sank onto the ground.

This included the corpses of the giant ogres from the previous battle.

The ground slowly rose and fell as if digesting something. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Qin Yu was trying intensely to comprehend the changes within. It was the Order of the Necromancy that he had obtained previously.

At that moment, the instant the way released, he could feel this square space

become his stomach.

He could feel the rotten black dragon taking shape again underground. This black dragon was under the control of this order entirely.

Qin Yu crushed two Spirit Recovery Pills in a row. His face was tremendously ashen.

Previously, he had only used about 10% of his mental power to digest the ogre completely.

But the consumption of mental power was tremendously rapid in digesting this black dragon this time. Soon, it depleted completely.

“Strengthening! ”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and used all his remaining Saint Power to strengthen his soul.

This was all the Saint Power he had obtained from tonight’s battle and the killing of Yin Lin and the others.

He could only withstand the terrifying consumption after the Saint Power fused with his soul wholly.

“Boom!”

The last bit of the black dragon’s bones fully dissolved into the esophagus.

After that, with a thought from Qin Yu, a black dragon under his control appeared.

At the last moment, it clashed with the black dragon that was diving down.

As the enormous forces clashed, Blackie was knocked back to the ground because it did not have the geographical advantage.

Ju Wuwei was also affected by that massive force and fell.

His body was thrown out like a cannonball. However, under Qin Yu’s control, the ground instantly turned soft, dissipating a portion of this massive force.

Nonetheless, Ju Wuwei was not spared, and his face was as pale as paper.

He had used all his might, even exceeding his limit, to exchange a few seconds blocking the black dragon.

“Ju Wuwei, I’ll hold this black dragon back first. You recover as soon as possible. We’ll retreat after we finish dealing with this black dragon.”

Qin Yu said fiercely.

Due to Li Yue’s betrayal, they were stuck halfway. Their merit points should not be too high.

However, if he could kill these two black dragons, he would still have a chance to obtain substantial merit points. They could even enter the bunker.

“Alright.’

Ju Wuwei sat on the ground and swallowed a few more pills, trying his best to recover.

After Blackie fell into the underground esophagus, it charged out again in the blink of an eye and fiercely bit the black dragon in the air.

“Blackie! Attack!”

Shen Qian could tell at this moment that Blackie was summoned by Qin Yu’s power. She shouted nervously by the side.

Qin Yu’s expression was solemn. At this moment, the two black dragons were fighting with all their might.

In less than ten seconds, blood started dripping from the two black dragons. Massive wounds appeared on their bodies.

Their strength was about the same, and they seemed to be about 30% weaker than the real black dragon.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and analyzed silently.

The injuries on Blackie, which he summoned, were much more severe than the injuries on the black dragon.

However, it was not afraid of death. Even if it died, it could still be summoned again. This was its advantage.

However. Oin Yu also noticed that as the strength of these creatures enhanced. the consumption of his mental strength would increase significantly, whether it was sucked into the esophagus or summoning them.

Therefore, summoning the black dragon once had reached its limit. To summon it again after death might turn Qin Yu into a dried-up husk.

30% of his strength was still tremendously terrifying. In this short period, Blackie was already on the verge of death.

“Giant Ogre! Attack!”

Qin Yu snapped his fingers, and nine giant ogres “squeezed” out from underground.

With the appearance of the nine giant ogres, the heavily injured Blackie swept the black dragon and bit its bone wings.

The nine giant ogres fearlessly charged at the black dragon.

A saber light appeared once again. This time, Ju Wuwei’s most powerful saber qi slashed at the black dragon’s throat.

A nearly twenty-centimeter-long wound appeared on the throat, and countless pieces of rotten flesh fell from the air.

Ju Wuwei’s body crashed onto the ground. He did not even have the strength to land.

A furious and sharp dragon roar came from the black dragon’s mouth. As Ju Wuwei had cut off its throat, its voice seemed to become tremendously hoarse, as unpleasant as scraping glass.

“Whoosh!

The nine ogres were instantly torn into pieces by the furious black dragon. Infuriated breath blew at Blackie’s massive wound, sending the heavily injured Blackie away.

“Whoosh!”

A dazzling arrow light shot from the black dragon’s throat, and the flames instantly ignited its entire body.

Qin Yu, at this moment, also shot out another arrow with all his might, ultimately defeating this heavily injured black dragon.

A vast amount of the soul’s Saint Power entered his entire soul. A portion of this terrifying Saint Power directly merged with the power of his soul, making his soul stronger again.

Qin Yu instantly felt his body unprecedentedly relaxed. The immense power of his soul suggested the ability to control an even stronger physical form. He did not expect this power to be so great.

A strand of Saint Power uncontrollably entered the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze, and a power gathered within the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze..
