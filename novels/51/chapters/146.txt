Chapter 147: Do You Want a Slap? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

When he saw Zhou Tong’s attitude, Qin Yu’s anger rose from the bottom of his heart.

The peasant couldn’t afford to offend these two people. She could only look at the child in her arms and cry silently.

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold. He took a step forward and stood in front of the man with the golden chains.

Then, he looked at Zhou Tong and said, “Doctor Zhou, I have a better treasure here. Can you let me go first?”

“Who are you? Don’t you know how to queue?” The man with the golden chains said angrily.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said with a sneer, “Are you queuing?”

“I don’t give a f * ck about that. Get out of my way!” After saying that, the man with the golden chains reached out and grabbed Qin Yu’s shoulder to pull Qin Yu to the side.

However, he tried his best, but he couldn’t move Qin Yu at all!

“Okay, okay. Just you wait!” The man with the golden chains pointed at Qin Yu’s nose and scolded.

“You dare to provoke me in Jiangcheng? I’ll f * cking kill you!” The man with the golden chains walked to the side and took out his phone to make a call.

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered with him at all. Instead, he looked at Zhou Tong and sneered. “Doctor Zhou, can I?”

Doctor Zhou smiled nonchalantly and said, “Of course you can, but you have to first show me what kind of treasure it is. If it is really valuable enough, I will naturally treat you first.”

Qin Yu nodded. He waved his hand and said, “This is it.”

Zhou Tong frowned and said with some confusion, “What do you mean? You clearly don’t have anything in your hand.”

“No? It’s in my hand. Can’t you see it?” Qin Yu asked.

Zhou Tong frowned and said with some displeasure, “You clearly don’t have anything in your hand. Are you teasing me?”

Qin Yu waved his hand and sneered. “Aren’t I?”

After saying that, Qin Yu slapped him in the face!

Zhou Tong immediately flew out of the chair!

“Do you want a slap?” Qin Yu sneered.

Zhou Tong was instantly furious. He got up from the ground and pointed at Qin Yu’s nose as he scolded, “You f * cking dared to hit me? Are you crazy?”

The crowd also whispered, “He dared to hit Doctor Zhou. What’s the background of this young man?”

“Yeah, if he offended Doctor Zhou, would Doctor Zhou treat us?”

“Young people are impulsive.”

Hearing the murmurs of the crowd, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel sorrowful from the bottom of his heart.

These people only cared about the benefits in front of them. If the persecution didn’t happen to them, they wouldn’t stand up or fight back.

It was precisely because of this reason that those oppressors were unbridled.

Qin Yu looked at Zhou Tong coldly and said, “Do you think you’re qualified to claim to be a Chinese Medicine Genius? Do you even have the benevolence a doctor should have?”

“The child in this woman’s arms has a high fever, yet you didn’t treat him. And that man with the golden chains just didn’t have enough time, yet you want to treat him. Can you be considered a doctor?”

“A person like you calls yourself a Chinese Medicine Genius? What a joke!”

These words made Zhou Tong’s face flushed.

However, he didn’t take Qin Yu’s words to heart at all. Instead, he pointed at Qin Yu and said, “This is the way of society. Don’t you understand?! You don’t have money, yet you want people to do things for you?”

“Only a weakling follows bad rules,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Hahaha!” Zhou Tong couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“You hit me. Have you thought about the consequences?!” Zhou Tong questioned loudly.

Qin Yu sneered. “If you killed a maggot, would you think about the consequences?”

Zhou Tong’s expression suddenly changed. He pointed at Qin Yu and cursed, “You dare to call me a maggot? Do you know what kind of status I have? Do you know how many high-ranking officials and nobles owe me favors?”

“None of my business.” Qin Yu sneered.

Zhou Tong’s expression changed. At this time, he suddenly looked at the door and said with pleasant surprise, “Kid, your retribution has come!”

He turned his head and saw a large group of tattooed burly men coming to the door!

These strong men were all fierce and burlesque!

“Kid, you dared to cut in front of me and even dared to hit Doctor Zhou. I will cripple you today!” The man with the golden chains said arrogantly.

Qin Yu didn’t even think it was worth it to make a move on such a nobody.

He took out his phone and immediately called Lei Hu.

“Come to Jiangcheng’s Chinese Medical Hospital and bring people with you.” Qin Yu’s words were brief and concise. After he said that, he hung up the phone.

On the other end, Lei Hu didn’t understand the situation at all. However, Qin Yu was his financial backer. He didn’t dare to go against Qin Yu’s wishes.

After thinking about it, Lei Hu said to Lance, “Go and call all your buddies. Go to the Chinese Medical Hospital immediately!” he said.

“Yes, Mr. Hu.” Lance nodded.

In the hospital, the man with the golden chains pointed at Qin Yu and cursed, “Kid, it’s not too late for you to apologize to me now.”

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “You’re just a nobody. You’re not worth my time. Just wait. Someone will come and negotiate with you later.”

“f * ck you. Who are you trying to scare? You’re just a nobody. Who do you think you are?” The man with the golden chains cursed. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Zhou Tong, who wasn’t far away, also sat down and drank some tea. He looked like he was looking forward to the drama.

“Thank you for your kindness, but... you should leave quickly. Don’t let anything happen to you because of me...” the peasant woman beside him said anxiously.

Qin Yu smiled and comforted, “Don’t worry. I’ll be fine.”

After saying that, Qin Yu glanced at the girl in her arms and said, “I’ll help you treat your daughter’s illness.”

“Hehe, you really know how to brag.” Zhou Tong couldn’t help but sneer.

“Who do you think you are? You can treat people’s illnesses?”

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “No matter who I am, I’m much better than a villain like you.”

“Doctor Zhou, leave this matter to me!” The man with the golden chains shouted, as if he was taking credit.

Zhou Tong nodded and said indifferently, “As long as you help me deal with this kid, I can treat your illness three times for free.”

“Really? Thank you, Doctor Zhou!” The man with the golden chains was instantly overjoyed!

“Rumble...”

At this moment, the sound of engines suddenly came from outside the door!

They saw countless cars driving towards the hospital!

These cars blocked the entrance of the Chinese Medical Hospital. Then, many burly men jumped out of the cars!

When they saw this scene, everyone’s faces turned pale with fright!

The man with the golden chains was stunned and muttered, “Why is Mr. Hu here?”

“Mr. Hu, why are you here?” Although the man with the golden chains couldn’t figure it out, he quickly walked over with a cigarette in his hand.

Lei Hu didn’t even look at him. Instead, he rushed to Qin Yu.

He wiped the sweat from his forehead and said, “Mr. Qin, what do you want to talk to me about...”
