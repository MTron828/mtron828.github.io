Qin Yu stood there without saying a word for a long time.

After a long time, Qin Yu looked around and said, “I plan to seclude myself here temporarily.”

The man with the mustache shivered and muttered, “Seclude yourself here? Are you sure? Aren’t you afraid that the two male corpses will jump out again?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Anyway, I’ve found a way to deal with them. Moreover... The cultivation environment here is very precious for me.”

The man with the mustache rolled his eyes and said, “If you want to stay, then stay. I won’t accompany you anyway. I don’t want to stay in this damn place for even a second.”

Obviously, the scene just now had scared the man with the mustache to death.

Qin Yu pulled the man with the mustache and said, “You have to come and pick me up in a while. Otherwise, I won’t be able to leave.”

The man with the mustache rolled his eyes and said, “Don’t worry. I won’t leave the Immortal Slaying Sect for the time being.”

“The Immortal Slaying Sect is so big. There must be some other treasure.” The man with the mustache licked his lips and said.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Okay.”

Then, he turned around and walked deeper into the tomb before returning to the dented area.

Looking at the coffin in front of him, Qin Yu took a deep breath.

It had to be said that even Qin Yu felt a little uncomfortable with the dark energy here.

He wasn’t sure whether the dark energy came from the coffin or from the bodies of the two male corpses.

“After absorbing the dark energy here, my strength should increase quite a bit,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Thinking of this, he took out the Three Pure Ancient Tree and hung it above his head.

Then, he began to cultivate bitterly.

The surrounding dark energy rushed towards Qin Yu’s body, strands after strands, practically freezing Qin Yu.

...

In the outside world.

It had been one and a half months since Qin Yu had left.

Everyone seemed to have forgotten about Qin Yu. To them, Qin Yu was like a bright shooting star that disappeared in a flash.

“Most geniuses have short lives, especially those without any powerful background,” someone said.

Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

Yan Ruoxue’s blood was still being sucked out every day.

And the Jingdu Martial Arts Association would send Yan Ruoxue top-grade pills and herbs every day.

These herbs could ensure that Yan Ruoxue’s life wouldn’t be endangered, as well as a daily ration of fresh blood supply.

“I have to say, her bloodline is indeed powerful,” Qu Xie said in a deep voice as he stood at the door of the prison.

An old woman with a hunched figure stood beside him.

This old woman looked to be at least in her eighties, but the internal qi on her body indicated her formidable strength.

“With this bloodline... The Jingdu Martial Arts Association can activate the bloodline power of three people,” the old woman said quietly.

Xie Qu nodded and said, “Yes, people with this bloodline power are invincible among those of the same level. They can even fight people above their level.”

At this point, Qu Xie asked with some confusion, “Granny Qin, what kind of bloodline does Yan Ruoxue have? Why is she so powerful?”

The old woman called Granny Qin bowed slightly. “We don’t know exactly what kind of bloodline she has. In short... Her bloodline is very powerful. As long as we rely on this bloodline, we can create countless powerhouses.”

Xie Qu bowed and sighed, “It’s really terrifying. The three people who have been baptized by the bloodline are probably not weaker than Qin Yu.”

Granny Qin said with a smile, “Of course.”

Granny Qin glanced at Xie Qu and said, “Let’s continue selecting talents.”

After saying that, Granny Qin turned around and was about to leave.

At this moment, Qu Xie suddenly blocked Granny Qin’s way.

“What? Do you have something else to say?” Granny Qin asked.

Qu Xie opened his mouth and said, “Granny Qin, I. . . I. . .”

“You also want the power of this bloodline, don’t you?” Granny Qin said faintly.

Qu Xie nodded and said with a bitter smile, “Who wouldn’t want this kind of power...”

Granny Qin smiled. “Don’t worry. You have contributed a lot to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association over the years. You’ll get a share.”

Qu Xie was overjoyed when he heard that. “Thank you, Granny Qin!”

Granny Qin didn’t say anything else and turned to leave.

Qu Xie looked at Yan Ruoxue in the prison and couldn’t help but smile. “Miss Yan, you have contributed a lot to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. I think... The Jingdu Martial Arts Association will remember you forever.”

Yan Ruoxue raised her head with great difficulty. Her pale face had no color at all.

Although the Jingdu Martial Arts Association used top-notch herbs to support Yan Ruoxue, her body was still extremely weak after being drained of blood for a long time.

“You guys... will be destroyed sooner or later,” Yan Ruoxue said with great difficulty.

When Qu Xie heard this, he couldn’t help but laugh out loud. “Miss Yan, who do you think can destroy the Jingdu Martial Arts Association? Don’t tell me you are still counting on Qin Yu?”

At this point, Qu Xie paused for a moment, then patted his head and said, “I forgot to tell you. Qin Yu is already dead. You still don’t know, right?”

Yan Ruoxue’s expression suddenly changed, and a trace of panic flashed in her eyes!

“What... What did you say? !” Yan Ruoxue’s voice was filled with intense fear.

Qu Xie said with a smile, “Qin Yu has been dead for more than a month. His body is probably rotten by now.”

“No... impossible! Absolutely impossible!” Yan Ruoxue shouted in grief and indignation.

Qu Xie sneered. “Do you think I have to lie to you? He, Qin Yu, has provoked our Jingdu Martial Arts Association many times. This is what he gets!”

“You guys are really naive. You all think that you can overthrow us with the power of one person. How pathetic.”

Yan Ruoxue said coldly, “I won’t believe you. Qin Yu can’t be dead!”

Xie Qu spread his hands and said, “It’s your own business whether you believe it or not.”

After saying that, he turned around and left.

“Come back! Come back! Tell me that Qin Yu isn’t dead!”

Yan Ruoxue’s shrill cry came from behind him.

However, Qu Xie ignored her and walked out of the prison.

...

Green Moon Villa.

Deng Sheng sat on the sect master’s seat as he wished.

As a former elder of the Saint Confucian Sect, his ability to buy people’s hearts was far superior to Zhen Yue’s.

Deng Sheng spent a month successfully taking Zhen Yue over and becoming the sect master of Green Moon Villa. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Miss Zhen, if you listen to me, I will let you stay in the Green Moon Villa and give you a way out,” Deng Sheng said lightly.

Zhen Yue’s expression was extremely ugly, but she couldn’t change anything.

Deng Sheng snorted and glanced at the crowd. He said lightly, “From today on, the Green Moon Villa will be renamed the Saint Confucian Sect!”

“Also, the statue of Qin Yu in the square will be demolished immediately!”
