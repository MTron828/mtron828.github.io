Chapter 612: Top-tier Weapon! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

He Teng held the Black Gold Ball in his hand and fused it with the black energy on his body.

Just as He Teng was about to make his move, his phone suddenly rang.

He picked up the phone and saw that the caller was actually Yan Guiyi.

He Teng frowned. He picked up the phone and walked to the side.

“How’s the matter going?” Yan Guiyi asked coldly. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He Teng glanced at Chang Mang, who was struggling on the ground, and said, “I’m planning to kill him.”

“Bring him back,” Yan Guiyi said coldly.

“Remember, he has to be alive. Someone is interested in his body.”

He Teng frowned. He was about to speak, but Yan Guiyi hung up the phone.

“D*mn it...” Yan Guiyi’s expression was cold. Chang Mang had a Saintly Body, so he was also interested. But he didn’t expect Yan Guiyi to have his eye on him too.

His gaze gloomy and hesitant, He Teng stared at this body for a long time.

“We can’t offend Yan Guiyi for the time being...” At this moment, the hoarse voice sounded in his mind.

He Teng gritted his teeth and could only give up.

He picked up Chang Mang and turned around to leave.

The entire Green Moon Villa was indignant, and they all had the intention of stopping him.

At this moment, Deng Sheng appeared in time and stopped everyone.

“We are no match for He Teng. Everyone, please calm down,” Deng Sheng said coldly.

“Are we just going to watch him take Chang Mang away like this?” Someone said angrily.

Deng Sheng snorted. “What else should we do? Should we send ourselves to our deaths? Remember, there’s always hope as long as we’re still alive.”

Although everyone was unwilling, Deng Sheng’s words made sense.

After Chang Mang was taken away, Deng Sheng revealed a cold smile.

“The heavens are really helping me!”

...

In the Immortal Slaying Sect, Qin Yu was still swallowing the inner cores.

One inner core after another exploded in Qin Yu’s body, and his strength increased quietly.

In the blink of an eye, a whole month had passed.

The number of inner cores in Qin Yu’s hands also decreased.

He got up and tried to break open the door, but unfortunately, the door still couldn’t be broken open. Not even a crack could be left.

“Don’t tell me... I’m really going to be trapped here for the rest of my life.” Qin Yu frowned tightly.

The Immortal Slaying Sect had been declining for many years. There were no renewable resources at all.

Without the inner cores, Qin Yu couldn’t even cultivate here.

“I wonder if there are any weapons left in the Immortal Slaying Sect. Perhaps I can use them to try and open this door.” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He could only place his hopes on weapons.

Thus, Qin Yu began to search for the Immortal Slaying Sect.

The members of the Immortal Slaying Sect were all at the Mighty Realm. The weapons they used naturally couldn’t be underestimated.

However, what disappointed Qin Yu was that there were indeed quite a few weapons, but they had all been smashed into dregs.

Forget about using them, he couldn’t even pick them up.

“What should I do...” looking at these dregs of weapons, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

He picked up a small fragment from the ground and tried to use his strength to crush it.

However, this fragment was extremely hard. Even if Qin Yu used all his strength, he was unable to shake it in the slightest.

“As expected of a weapon of the Mighty Realm!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but be somewhat surprised.

Such hardness was something that even Black Gold Stone couldn’t compare to.

“If I can use these fragments... perhaps I can create a top-tier weapon!” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

At this moment, Qin Yu slapped his head, as if he had thought of something!

He hurriedly took out a cauldron from the Spatial Magic Artifact and placed it in the middle!

This cauldron was the Artifact Refining Cauldron that he and the man with the mustache had obtained by chance at the Dragon Vein!

“That’s right, I have an Artifact Refining Cauldron! If I can collect these fragments and attach them to the bronze sword, won’t I be able to forge a top-tier weapon!?” Qin Yu was overjoyed!

With Qin Yu’s weapon refining skills, it was impossible for him to forge a complete weapon with these fragments.

Therefore, he could only try to attach them to the bronze sword!

However, this was enough. After all, these materials had been passed down since ancient times and were used by Mighty Realm powerhouses.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu immediately began to search for fragments.

He spent a day and a night to finally collect a lump of fragments.

Qin Yu put these fragments into the Artifact Refining Cauldron and then took out the bronze sword.

“I hope that I can succeed.” Qin Yu threw the bronze sword and the fragments into the Artifact Refining Cauldron.

Then, he began to search for the weapon refining technique in the memories left by his father.

Fortunately, the techniques in his father’s inheritance were abundant, so the weapon refining technique was not difficult to find.

Qin Yu spent another three days to understand the weapon refining spell.

After everything was ready, Qin Yu was ready to start refining.

Weapon refining and pill refining had the same effect.

The difference was that the flames needed for weapon refining were purer.

After all, the hardness of these materials was far higher than that of the herbs.

Of course, in this way, the requirements for the control of the fire didn’t need to be so stringent.

“Refining a weapon consumes much more spiritual fire than refining pills,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He tried to place a ball of spiritual fire into the Artifact Refining Cauldron. Then, he began to urge the flames to refine the bronze sword.

As the spiritual fire entered, the Artifact Refining Cauldron immediately emitted waves of dense air.

These waves of internal qi fused with the spiritual fire and released a powerful energy!

It was by relying on this energy that Qin Yu was able to fuse with these fragments.

“I really wonder how the Artifact Refining Cauldron can even refine such hard materials,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He summoned the purple spiritual fire and slowly melted these materials.

Under the combination of the spiritual fire and the Artifact Refining Cauldron, the materials began to melt.

Next was the most important step.

Qin Yu closed his eyes and relied on his powerful divine sense to activate the internal qi of the Artifact Refining Cauldron so that the melted materials would fuse with the bronze sword.

This was an extremely complicated and long process. Qin Yu sat there for three whole days.

In these three days, his spiritual power had been depleted by more than half, and his divine sense was almost exhausted.

However, Qin Yu didn’t dare to relax, because if he relaxed even a little, it might lead to the failure of the refinement.

The material was attached to the bronze sword, and the bronze sword emitted a series of buzzing sounds. In the artifact refinement cauldron, it began to tremble.

“Buzz!”

Another three days passed, and the bronze sword finally erupted with a dazzling light!

A huge wave of energy exploded, and then, the bronze sword actually turned into a scarlet color! It was as if it was stained with blood!

Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes. He couldn’t care less about his fatigue as he quickly took out the bronze sword from the cauldron!

“Success!” Qin Yu said excitedly.

“It seems that... the artifact refinement isn’t that difficult.”

If his words were to spread, there was no telling how many people would be enraged.

Qin Yu held the bronze sword and tried to inject a wisp of spiritual power into it.

In an instant, the bronze sword began to tremble violently!

An ancient internal qi wrapped around the bronze sword!

Qin Yu closed his eyes. He could even feel the vigorous surging power within the bronze sword!

“How powerful!” Qin Yu exclaimed in shock.

Not only were these fragments indestructible, but they were also contaminated with a trace of the power of a Mighty Realm powerhouse!

Now, all of this power had been injected into the bronze sword!

Qin Yu held back his excitement. He looked at the door not far away and said in a low voice, “I wonder if I can break through this door!”
