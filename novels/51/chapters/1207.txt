Chapter 1208: Chapter 1,208, Lord of Triangle City 

The man called Chief Bao immediately stood up and walked towards Qin Yu.

Qin Yu, on the other hand, was slowly getting excited.

From the conversation between the two of them, it seemed that they were interested in their mother’s constitution.

Could it be that their mother also had a chaotic body? Their own constitution was inherited from their mother?

This possibility was too great, because a chaotic body was different from other constitutions like the holy body. Before stepping into the path of cultivation, a chaotic body was no different from an ordinary person!

That was why his mother had been an ordinary person all her life!

Just as Qin Yu was thinking, director Bao had already walked over.

His palm flickered with a bright light, and he slowly placed it on Qin Yu’s forehead. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Qin Yu only felt a strange aura enveloping his entire body. After a moment, a trace of surprise and excitement flashed on director Bao’s face.

“Haha, this child really has a chaotic body.”Director Bao could not help but laugh out loud in excitement.

Old Meng couldn’t help but exclaim from the side, “Really? This kid really inherited the Constitution of the Jade Bodhisattva?”

“That’s right, Old Meng. You’ve done a meritorious deed this time.”Director Bao said faintly.

After saying that, director Bao extended his palm and threw a small bottle of dark green liquid to Old Meng.

This liquid seemed to be extremely attractive. After Old Meng received this liquid, he immediately became extremely excited.

“Thank you, Chief Bao!”Old Meng cupped his hands.

Chief Bao said faintly, “If this child really allows the lord to be fully resurrected, you will have an even greater reward.”

Old Meng said somewhat excitedly, “Chief bao, can you let me be the city lord of this Triangle City?”

Chief Bao raised his eyebrows and said faintly, “Your ambition is not small. I will consider it carefully.”

“Thank you, Chief Bao!”Old Meng hurriedly cupped his hands and thanked him.

Hearing their conversation, Qin Yu couldn’t help but look at chief bao coldly and said, “Are you the city lord of this Triangle City?”

Chief Bao Glanced at Qin Yu and said, “You don’t need to know so much.”

Qin Yu’s face was cold. He suppressed the anger in his heart and said no more.

Then, chief Bao personally led Qin Yu to the depths of the palace.

What surprised Qin Yu was that there were many people in this palace, and most of them were martial artists.

Each of them was dressed in a suit, and they seemed to have a close relationship with triangle city.

“You Control Triangle City?”Qin Yu asked coldly.

Chief Bao chuckled, “What’s the point of knowing so much?”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He just wanted to save his mother as soon as possible.

As for what was going on in Triangle City, Qin Yu didn’t have the heart to care.

Soon, the two of them arrived at the depths of the palace.

There was a gate several meters high. The gate gave off a strict internal Qi. Not only that, the gate seemed to have used some secret method to isolate it from the outside world.

Chief Bao put his hand on the gate and said, “Lord, I have brought the person. He is indeed a chaotic body.”

Not long after, a voice sounded from within the door: “What is this person’s name?”

Chief Bao’s brows creased up slightly as he looked at Qin Yu and asked: “What is your name?”

“My name is Zhang Fei.”Qin Yu casually made up a name.

Chief Bao did not doubt it and said to the door: “My lord, this person’s name is Zhang Fei.”

The person on the other end was silent for a moment before he said: “The recent development of the fire country’s martial arts has already exceeded our imaginations. There are some people that we can not touch, like that ye Qing, Jiang he, and now there is another person called Qin Yu.”

Chief Bao shot a glance at Qin Yu and asked: “Do you know them?”

“No.”Qin Yu said coldly.

Hearing that, the door slowly opened.

It was pitch black inside, and within that pitch black darkness, there was another figure hidden.

This person was also dressed in a black robe, his back facing Qin Yu.

“My lord, I have brought the person.”Chief Bao said with a bow.

The Lord slowly turned his body and raised his palm slightly. Qin Yu’s body could not help but rush towards him.

“My lord, I have already checked. This child has a chaotic body.”Chief Bao said.

The Lord nodded slightly. He sized up Qin Yu in front of him and said coldly, “I didn’t expect that not only did you inherit your mother’s physique, you also inherited it so completely...”

At this time, Qin Yu couldn’t hold it in any longer. He looked at the lord coldly and said, “Where is my mother now? I know that she isn’t dead yet.”

The Lord said coldly, “Although your mother has a chaotic body, her body is extremely weak and she can’t cultivate at all.”

“I’ve spent a lot of manpower and material resources, and used countless secret techniques, but I still can’t change this situation. I can only give up. Fortunately, you appeared.”

“Give up? What do you mean?”Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed.

The Lord said sinisterly, “Giving up means that you have lost your value. What do you think?”

Qin Yu instantly had an extremely bad premonition.

“Where is my mother!”Qin Yu said angrily.

“Impudent, how dare you speak to the Lord!”A black-robed man behind him shouted loudly.

Qin Yu was no longer in the mood to endure. He suddenly stood up and with a shake of his arms, the chains on his body were shattered.

“Huh?”

Seeing this scene, everyone’s expression changed. The two black-robed men quickly stepped forward, preparing to take down Qin Yu.

Qin Yu did not even turn his head. He slapped the two black-robed men, turning them into a bloody mist.

“I’m asking you, where’s My Mother?”Qin Yu said coldly.

The Lord in front of him seemed to have sensed something was wrong.

He asked coldly, “Have you already stepped into the path of cultivation?”

“I’m F * cking asking you where my mother is!”Qin Yu’s palm suddenly stretched out and directly grabbed at the Lord!

But what surprised Qin Yu was that his palm actually directly pierced through the black robe.

Under the black robe, there was no one there!

“You... . . Who exactly are you! ?”The expression on chief Bao’s face changed drastically as countless black robed men charged in from behind him.

“I am Qin Yu.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“You are Qin Yu?”Everyone’s faces immediately changed drastically!

The Lord’s voice once again propped up the black robe.

A voice came from under the black robe.

“It is rumoured that there is a person from the fire country... . .”

“I am F * cking asking you where my mother is!”Qin Yu roared angrily, shaking the entire hall into a buzzing sound!

The Lord then said in a deep voice: “I do not wish to be enemies with you. It was all a misunderstanding before.”

After that, he floated in front of chief bao and said: “Where is Bodhisattva Jade?”

Chief Bao swallowed his saliva and said: “Half an hour ago, I sent someone to send her to be dealt with... . . I will call them to stop now. There should still be time!”

Qin Yu gritted her teeth and said, “If my mother is fine, everything will be fine. If my mother is missing a hair, I will make this triangle city disappear!”
