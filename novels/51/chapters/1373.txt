Chapter 1374: Chapter 1374, Mount Hua Ning

The Great Elder revealed a strange and proud smile on his face.

“Let’s see where you can run to.”The great elder waved his hand and led several people away.

He followed Wen da Wen Er’s aura and chased them all the way, but the more they walked, the more they realized that something was wrong.

“Great Elder, this route... seems to be the route of Mount Hua Ning.”A disciple at the side frowned and said.

Great Elder naturally saw it too. He said coldly, “I’m afraid they have escaped to Mount Hua Ning.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Then do we still have to go? Offending Jue Wu is not a wise choice...”

“Go, of course we have to go.”Great Elder sneered.

Not to mention offending Jue Wu, even if they offended everyone in the world, the Heavenly Cloud sect would still capture Qin Yu this time.

Very quickly, the group arrived at the foot of Mount Hua Ning.

Under the lead of the first elder, they ascended Mount Hua Ning.

Just as they ascended the mountain, Jue Wu’s two young attendants quickly walked out.

“Stop!”The youth held a treasured sword in his hand and shouted loudly.

“This is Lord Jue Wu’s residence. No one is allowed to trespass here.”

The first elder’s expression was cold. He took a deep breath and said, “My two young friends, we have no other intentions. We are only here to look for Qin Yu. We hope that the two of you will cooperate and hand him over.”

“Impudent! You Dare to come to Hua Ning mountain to ask for him!”The youth was instantly enraged.

The first elder said coldly, “I am the first elder of the Heavenly Cloud sect. Qin Yu has a deep hatred towards us. I hope that the two of you do not fail to appreciate our kindness.”

“I don’t care who you are! In any case, you are not allowed to barge in here!”The youth said coldly.

The first elder narrowed his eyes and said, “Then what if we barge in?”

“Then give it a try!”The two young men made a pose and prepared to meet the attack at any time.

The first elder said with a hint of ridicule, “Don’t think that I don’t know that Jue Wu is already in closed door cultivation. The two of you can’t Stop Me at all!”

The faces of the two changed slightly, and a trace of solemnity flashed across their brows.

“If you force your way in, Lord Jue Wu will definitely not spare you after he comes out of closed door cultivation!”The young girl said with an icy tone.

“That’s for the future. Let’s talk about it in the future!”The first elder snorted.

Then, he waved his hand and said, “Search for him!”

At this moment, Wen Da and Wen Er walked out from inside.

Seeing these two people, the first elder narrowed his eyes and sneered, “You are indeed hiding here!”

Wen Da picked his nose and said, “We are indeed here, but unfortunately, Qin Yu is not here.”

The Great Elder’s pupils contracted slightly as he said coldly, “What do you mean?”

“Do You Think Qin Yu is a fool? He had long seen that you guys could catch our aura, so he had long split up and moved out.”Wen Da sneered.

“That’s right, that’s right. If you are a fool, don’t think that others are also stupid.”Wen Er also said.

The Great Elder’s expression changed slightly. Although he said so, he still had some doubts.

What if this was a smoke bomb deliberately thrown by Qin Yu?

“My two young friends, let us go in and search. If we can’t find it, we will leave immediately.”The great elder looked at Jue Wu’s two followers.

The youth immediately shouted, “Lord Jue Wu is in closed-door cultivation. No one is allowed to disturb him!”

“Don’t worry. We will definitely not disturb Jue Wu.”The great elder continued.

“Sigh, forget it, let them go in and look for her. Anyway, if they wake Jue Wu up, they’ll have to bear the consequences,”Wen da said with a wave of his hand.

The young man and young woman looked at each other and seemed to agree to this suggestion.

After all, with their abilities, there was no way they could stop the first elder.

“Then I’m warning you, don’t make any big movements.”The young man let out a sigh of relief and then opened up a path.

The first elder didn’t say anything and immediately led his people into Mount Hua Ning.

Half an hour later.

The first elder and the others appeared at the entrance again.

“How is it? I told you, Qin Yu isn’t here at all.”Wen Da sneered.

The first Elder’s expression wasn’t too good. He took a deep breath and said, “This treacherous villain...”

“Great Elder, what do we do now?”The person beside him asked.

The great elder gritted his teeth and said, “Let’s Go!”

They didn’t stay any longer and quickly left the place.

At this moment, Qin Yu was hurrying towards Yang City.

Without flying exotic beasts, Qin Yu could only walk on foot.

But this was an extremely long journey. Without flying exotic beasts, it would take at least a few days.

Qin Yu wiped the sweat off his forehead and said in a low voice, “At this speed, they will find me sooner or later.”

Back when they were in Qingyan Forest, Ling Yun had a divine weapon that could find people. Naturally, the first elder would be able to find Qin Yu through the tracking device.

“With my speed, it will take at least a few days to reach Yang City.”Qin Yu frowned.

His surroundings were barren and overgrown with weeds. He could even see some unknown demonic beasts running around.

Qin Yu looked up and saw a city appearing in front of him.

This city looked like it had been in decline for many years. The names on the city walls had been covered by the wind and sand.

Qin Yu’s feet shook and wiped the wind and sand off the city walls. Two big words appeared in front of Qin Yu: Divine Capital City.

The name was extraordinary, but there was no one in the entire city.

“Forget it, I’ll settle down here for now,”Qin Yu thought.

He immediately stepped into the divine capital. As soon as he entered, a strong sense of oppression assaulted him.
