Chapter 189: Rumors Were Spreading Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Xu Maojun looked at Qin Yu in surprise and walked forward quickly.

“Mr. Xu, you know him?” Peter asked with some confusion.

Xu Maojun hurriedly nodded and said, “Sir, this is the genius doctor I told you about! He is the one who changed my views!”

“With him, Mr. Yang’s illness will definitely be cured!” Xu Maojun said excitedly.

Peter sized up Qin Yu and said with some surprise, “He actually looks so young?”

Qin Yu shook his head helplessly and said, “Can I treat Mr. Yang’s illness now?”

“Of course, but... I still have some doubts about Mr. Qin. I hope you don’t mind,” Peter said in a sullen voice.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I won’t mind.”

Then, Qin Yu walked to Yang Xiao.

He raised his palm and placed it on Yang Xiao’s forehead. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

In an instant, countless pieces of information flashed through Qin Yu’s mind.

This was the medical skills passed down from his father.

Pieces of information about Yang Xiao’s illness flashed through Qin Yu’s mind.

“Limb-onset ALS, weakness of the muscles in the limbs, difficulty in swallowing, very likely respiratory failure,” Qin Yu said in a sullen voice.

Peter nodded repeatedly. What Qin Yu said was exactly the same as Yang Xiao’s symptomns.

But that didn’t mean anything. Any experienced doctor could do it.

“Mr. Qin, how is he? Can my father be saved?” Yang Jing asked anxiously.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “No problem, but I’m afraid it will take some time.”

With Qin Yu’s current skills, ordinary diseases could be easily cured.

However, Qin Yu couldn’t solve such a difficult problem of the century, even if he relied on spiritual energy. He could only rely on a pill.

Fortunately, a series of treatment plans and the formula for the pill quickly flashed through Qin Yu’s mind.

“Miss Yang, give me three days. I will temporarily stabilize your father’s condition, but I’m afraid it will take half a year to cure him,” said Qin Yu.

“Half a year?” Yang Jing couldn’t help but feel stunned.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “Prepare paper, pen, and a quiet room for me.”

Yang Jing didn’t dare to be negligent. She quickly prepared paper and pen according to Qin Yu’s request.

Qin Yu wrote down the relevant prescription on the paper and handed it to Yang Jing.

“These are common herbs on the market. They should be easy to buy,” Qin Yu said.

Yang Jing quickly nodded and said, “Okay, I’ll buy them now.”

About an hour later, Yang Jing returned to the manor with the herbs.

Qin Yu took the herbs and checked them. After making sure that there was no problem, he turned around and walked into a quiet room.

“It’s best not to disturb me during this period,” said Qin Yu.

Yang Jing quickly nodded and said, “Okay, I’ll get someone to guard this room.”

Qin Yu closed the door quickly. Qin Yu began to refine the pill according to the information in his mind.

This pill was called the pulse-protecting pill. It could temporarily stabilize Yang Xiao’s condition.

And the real cure was the marrow-generating pill.

The marrow-generating pill would slowly help Yang Xiao’s muscles recover, but it would take a long time.

“Can Qin Yu really cure Mr. Yang’s ALS? You must know that this is an international problem.” In the ward, Peter fell into deep thought.

Xu Maojun said, “Sir, I had the same doubts as you, but after seeing Mr. Qin, I realized that I was too shallow.”

Although that was the case, Peter still had some doubts.

If he could cure ALS, he could win any medical award in the world. How could Qin Yu be so obscure?

...

Chuzhou, provincial capital.

The Jiang family soon received the news that Qin Yu had left.

“Mr. Zhong, I heard that Qin Yu has gone abroad!” One of his subordinates said with a face full of hatred.

Mr. Zhong’s face was gloomy as he said with a cold expression, “When the family head was about to come out of seclusion, he went abroad. Qin Yu... must have received the news!”

The news that Qin Yu had gone abroad quickly spread!

For a moment, all the families, big and small, were discussing this matter!

“Qin Yu actually ran away?”

“Sigh, facing the Jiang family, he had no choice but to run. He is a wise man who understands the circumstances.”

“Tsk tsk, then the people around him are probably going to be unlucky.”

In the Wei family’s home, Wei Tao said coldly, “You’ve heard about it, right? Qin Yu has already fled abroad!”

“Fortunately, I made you draw a clear line with him in time. Otherwise, the Wei family would definitely be implicated!”

Wei Ming hurriedly shook his head and said, “Impossible! Mr. Qin is definitely not that kind of person!”

“Not that kind of person? Could this sort of news be groundless?! I think you’ve been brainwashed by that kid!” Wei Tao berated.

Wei Ming, wanting to find out more, hurriedly took out his phone and called Qin Yu.

Unfortunately, Qin Yu’s phone was already turned off.

“How is it? Did he pick up?” Wei Tao sneered.

Wei Ming gritted his teeth and said, “He... he must have something going on, so he couldn’t pick up the phone...”

“You’re really stubborn! Let me tell you, from today onwards, you’re not allowed to mention anyone or anything related to Qin Yu, or else the Wei family will definitely suffer the wrath of the Jiang Family!” Wei Tao said and got up to leave.

The speed at which this news spread was beyond imagination.

Even Yan Ruoxue, who was far away in Jingdu, learned of this matter.

“Qin Yu actually ran away? That can’t be. With his personality and temper, he definitely wouldn’t implicate other people,” Yan Ruoxue said with a hint of shock.

Old Mister Yan put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “In the face of the powerful Jiang family, running away is nothing. As long as one is alive, there is hope.”

However, Yan Ruoxue shook her head and said, “Impossible. If Qin Yu runs away, the Jiang family will definitely vent their anger on the people around him. Qin Yu wouldn’t do that.”

Old Mister Yan didn’t care. He shook his head and said, “Ruoxue, when a person should be ruthless, he should be ruthless. Even if Qin Yu doesn’t leave, what is the point?”

Yan Ruoxue was silent, but she still found it hard to believe.

“I believe that Qin Yu would never run.” Yan Ruoxue eventually chose to trust her intuition.

Old Mister Yan shook his head helplessly and said, “Ruoxue, aren’t you a little optimistic about Qin Yu?”

A smile appeared on Yan Ruoxue’s face. She said with some longing, “Although I haven’t known him for long, I keep feeling that... I know him very well.”

Hearing this, Old Mister Yan couldn’t help but feel surprised.

He suddenly remembered Qin Yu’s father.

At that time, Old Mister Yan was still a young man. Regarding Qin Yu’s father, he was full of respect for him.

“Xiao Yan, my son and your granddaughter will be a match made in heaven. Remember, they are destined to be a couple.”

As a young man, Old Mister Yan didn’t even have a son, so how could he have had a granddaughter?

At that time, he didn’t really believe it.

Ever since Yan Ruoxue and Qin Yu fell in love, Old Mister Yan started to believe in it more and more.

“As expected, you are never wrong.” Old Mister Yan looked out of the window and whispered.
