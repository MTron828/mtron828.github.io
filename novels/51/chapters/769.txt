Yan Jinyao’s expression turned ugly when he saw Qin Yu.

He said coldly, “Qin Yu, this little girl killed one of my disciples. You have to give me an explanation!”

“You want an explanation? Fine, I’ll give it to you.” Qin Yu sneered.

Before he could finish his sentence, a golden light suddenly flashed!

Then, the head of Yan Jinyao’s disciple was smashed by a slap!

“This is the explanation I gave you. Are you satisfied?” Qin Yu questioned coldly.

Yan Jinyao’s eyes instantly widened.

Anger appeared all over his face!

“Qin Yu, aren’t you going too far?!” Yan Jinyao said coldly.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “You were the one who brought people to find trouble, so he deserved to be slapped to death by Xiao Yu.”

“As your master, you actually made a move yourself! Since you are so shameless, why should I give you any face?!”

“I’m just returning the favor!”

Yan Jinyao was immediately furious and said, “You are full of nonsense! If you don’t give me an explanation today, you can forget about walking out of this door!”

Qin Yu strode forward, and a golden light appeared!

“Yan Jinyao, if you want to pick a fight, I’ll accompany you!” Qin Yu’s arrogance was soaring, and his invincible posture was fully displayed!

Yan Jinyao’s body also erupted with rays of light, and the internal qi of both parties instantly formed a vortex!

At this moment, Yan Jinyao suddenly withdrew his internal qi.

He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “There will definitely be a battle between you and me, but not now. I’ll let you live a few more days.”

After saying this, Yan Jinyao turned around and left.

Qin Yu didn’t stop him.

His body hadn’t yet recovered to its peak. If he attacked, he might not be Yan Jinyao’s match.

After he left, Qin Yu looked at Xiao Yu and frowned. “How are you? Are you hurt?”

Xiao Yu shook her head and said, “No.”

The man with the mustache smiled embarrassedly and said, “Xiao Yu, speaking of which, your attack just now was indeed too fierce. There’s no need to take someone’s life just like that...”

Obviously, from the man with the mustache’s point of view, the masked woman’s nature was beginning to show.

If she was allowed to develop, no one knew what would happen.

Qin Yu, on the other hand, had a different attitude.

He patted Xiao Yu’s head and said, “It’s okay. He’s the one who started it. There’s no need to blame yourself.”

“Okay.” Xiao Yu nodded and didn’t say anything else.

At this moment, Xiao Yu suddenly said, “I plan to leave for a period of time.”

Qin Yu frowned. “Leave? Where are you going?”

Xiao Yu said, “I don’t know either, but I keep feeling that it’s time for me to leave.”

Qin Yu opened his mouth to say something to stop her.

But he couldn’t help but think of the confrontation between the two of them at the Immortal Slaying Sect.

“Okay.” Qin Yu agreed for the first time.

“Qin Yu, you...” the man with the mustache was shocked. He didn’t expect Qin Yu to agree.

Qin Yu reached out and interrupted the man with the mustache. He looked at Xiao Yu and continued, “But you have to wait for me for two days.”

“Okay.” Xiao Yu nodded.

After saying that, Xiao Yu turned around and went back to her room.

“Qin Yu, how can you agree to her? Don’t you know that she is an extremely dangerous person? If she isn’t under your nose, no one knows what she will do!” The man with the mustache said anxiously.

Qin Yu glanced at the man with the mustache and said, “Do you think that even if I keep her by my side, I can stop her from growing?”

The man with the mustache opened his mouth and was suddenly speechless.

That’s right. As long as Xiao Yu didn’t die, it was only a matter of time before she became the masked woman.

“Moreover, what happened last time has already been exposed. The Jingdu Martial Arts Association won’t idly sit by. With their nature, they will most likely take Xiao Yu away,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“Letting her leave might be a better choice.”

Seeing this, the man with the mustache didn’t say anything more.

Then, Qin Yu left the Martial Arts Academy.

He went out to buy a few high-quality jade pendants and injected his divine sense into them. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

After two whole days, this jade pendant finally took shape.

“Xiao Yu, take this jade pendant with you. Don’t take it off for even a moment. If you are in danger, I can find you immediately,” Qin Yu said.

Xiao Yu took the jade pendant and nodded. “Okay.”

After taking the jade pendant, Xiao Yu said goodbye to Qin Yu and the man with the mustache before leaving the Jingdu Martial Arts Academy.

Looking at Xiao Yu’s departing figure, Qin Yu suddenly felt somewhat reluctant to part with her.

“No one knows what the next time we meet will be like,” Qin Yu muttered softly.

...

It had been three full days since the last great battle.

During these three days, Granny Qin still didn’t wake up.

Although the Jingdu Martial Arts Association had done its best to restore her body, her body still hadn’t fully recovered.

Qin Yu could be considered to have gotten a few days of respite.

As he sat in the room, he couldn’t help but recall the scene of the great battle with Blackie.

“The power of a Martial Saint... with my current realm, there’s really nothing I can do,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

The power of a Martial Saint was unrivaled. To a Martial Marquis, it was an existence that could crush him.

It was already a miracle for Qin Yu to be able to survive.

“Since there was no result from the previous battle, Will the heavenly guardian book take effect?” Qin Yu looked at the man with the mustache and asked.

The man with the mustache shook his head and said, “Of course not.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “In other words, the heavenly guardian book is no longer useful?”

“No.” The man with the mustache shook his head.

“The last time, there was no winner, so it will automatically be postponed to the next fight,” the man with the mustache explained.

Qin Yu nodded.

According to Xia Hang’s information, Granny Qin would need at least half a month to recover from her injuries.

To Qin Yu, this half a month was extremely precious.

“I must think of a way to deal with his Martial Saint’s power,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Otherwise, Qin Yu would definitely lose the next time they fought.

At the same time.

The Jingdu Martial Arts Association was in the middle of a meeting.

Eight high-ranking officials appeared in the meeting room once again.

This time, the person participating wasn’t Granny Qin, but Xia Hang.

On the big screen in the meeting room, a video was playing.

This video was the scene of Qin Yu and Blackie’s battle that day.

Although the image was a little blurry, one could still roughly see the outline.

“What is that move of his? He can actually resist the power of a Martial Saint?” A higher-up asked coldly.

“Within the Martial Marquis realm, Qin Yu is the only one who can resist the power of a Martial Saint.”

“Mm, this kid can resist the power of a Martial Saint at the Martial Marquis Realm. His future... I don’t dare to imagine it.”

“It seems that the prophecy is correct. This child might really become a Martial Saint. When that time comes, it will be troublesome.”

Xia Hang sat at the side silently while listening to the words of the eight higher-ups.

“Shouldn’t we take the necessary measures?” A higher-up said coldly.
