Chapter 561: Heavenly Tribulation! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The disciples of the Saint Confucian Sect didn’t dare to be negligent. They rushed toward Qin Yu with all kinds of spells while trying to interrupt Qin Yu’s breakthrough!

At this moment, Zhen Yue led the people of the Green Moon Villa to stop Qin Yu.

“Don’t you dare to interrupt Mr. Qin’s cultivation!” Zhen Yue shouted fiercely!

The people of the Green Moon Villa also shouted, “Don’t you dare to interrupt Sect Master Qin’s cultivation!”

“Humph! A bunch of reckless fools!” Gu Canghai said coldly.

“Kill anyone who dares to stop us!”

“Yes!” The people of the Saint Confucian Sect shouted immediately.

They were all peak-stage Inner Strength Grandmasters, and there were even half-step Martial Marquises!

The strongest people of the Green Moon Villa were only peak-stage Inner Strength Grandmasters, so how could they deal with them?!

“Everyone, we must stop them no matter what!” Zhen Yue gritted her teeth and said.

“As long as Mr. Qin makes a breakthrough, the Saint Confucian Sect will be doomed!”

With that said, Zhen Yue took the lead and charged forward!

With Zhen Yue’s leadership and Yan Jiang’s sacrifice, everyone seemed to be inspired.

The battle broke out in an instant!

In an instant, light shone everywhere, and blood flowed like a river!

From time to time, people were sent flying, and one could even see their skulls being shattered on the spot!

Even so, they still stood in front of Qin Yu!

“Bang!”

Someone slapped Zhen Yue’s chest.

Zhen Yue’s delicate body was sent flying, and her face turned extremely pale.

“Humph! A bunch of ants are trying to stop us?” The disciples of the Saint Confucian Sect said coldly.

Zhen Yue glanced at Qin Yu, who was glowing with light. She gritted her teeth and stood up from the ground!

“Mr. Qin, you have to be fast!” Zhen Yue shouted inside!

Seeing this, Gu Canghai’s expression turned extremely ugly!

He tried to shake off Yan Jiang, but Yan Jiang was like a shackle that bound him tightly. He wouldn’t let go no matter what.

Gu Canghai started to get anxious. He knew very well that once Qin Yu stepped into the Martial Marquis Realm, the Saint Confucian Sect wouldn’t be able to stop Qin Yu from going on a rampage!

“These d*mn ants!” Gu Canghai roared again and again!

He subconsciously looked in the direction of Qin Yu, then saw that his internal qi was bursting out and his acupoints were lit up everywhere. It was the sign of breaking through to the Martial Marquis Realm! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“D*mn it! D*mn it!” Gu Canghai raised his head and roared. Rays of light from his palm shot out and pierced straight into Yan Jiang’s vital points!

“Pu!”

Yan Jiang seemed like he couldn’t take it anymore. His consciousness gradually became blurry, but his mind kept giving him an order.

That was to stop Gu Canghai!

“Boom!”

At this moment, Zhen Yue’s body was sent flying again!

Blood continued to flow from the corner of her mouth, and a huge bloody hole appeared in her chest!

Facing a half-step Martial Marquis, Zhen Yue had no way to fight back.

She tried to get up, but a sharp blade pierced into her left chest, and her body was nailed to the wall!

More than half of the people in Green Moon Villa were killed or injured, and the rest of the people started to feel afraid.

Looking at the corpses on the ground, they couldn’t help but step back.

Although they admired Qin Yu, everyone was afraid of death.

“Hurry up and stop Qin Yu!” Gu Canghai shouted.

The people around him immediately walked towards Qin Yu!

At this moment, Yan Jiang couldn’t hold on any longer.

His entire body started to feel weak, and all his internal qi was slowly disappearing.

His vision went dark, and the hand that was holding Gu Canghai was finally released.

“Qin Yu, I’ll leave it to you...” Yan Jiang muttered in a low voice, and then collapsed on the ground.

Gu Canghai’s expression was ice-cold, and his internal qi surged. He snorted coldly and said, “Qin Yu, don’t even think about stepping into the Martial Marquis Realm!”

As he spoke, Gu Canghai had already rushed toward Qin Yu with large strides!

He held the power of destruction in his hand, and he wanted to kill Qin Yu with one strike!

Just as his palm was about to reach out toward Qin Yu, dark clouds suddenly condensed in the sky!

“Crack!!”

A muffled thunder shot down from the sky!

The lightning landed right in front of Gu Canghai!

Gu Canghai’s expression changed drastically, and his hand subconsciously retracted!

“Oh no! It’s too late!” Gu Canghai’s expression was extremely ugly!

If Qin Yu stepped into the Martial Marquis Realm, Gu Canghai wouldn’t be a threat!

Gu Canghai knew better than anyone. He gritted his teeth to stop Qin Yu’s breakthrough.

However, facing this heavenly tribulation that contained the power of nature, Gu Canghai didn’t dare to take a step forward!

Qin Yu’s body flickered with specks of light, and a terrifying internal qi was brewing in his body.

Crack!

At this moment, the ten beams of light that were inserted into Qin Yu’s body were forcefully broken through by the internal qi!

His physical body was recovering at an extremely fast speed!

Qin Yu slowly stood up from the ground.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s face was glowing!

He looked coldly at Gu Canghai.

Just this gaze alone made Gu Canghai feel a chill on his back!

“The heavenly tribulation... has finally arrived.” Qin Yu raised his head to look at the large clouds that had gathered in the sky and muttered softly.

Gu Canghai took a deep breath and said coldly, “Qin Yu, with me here, you can forget about successfully surviving the heavenly tribulation!”

“Do as you wish,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Gu Canghai gritted his teeth. The qi energy on his body surged rapidly as he tried to stop Qin Yu!

But at this moment, heavenly lightning descended from the sky!

“Boom!”

This heavenly lightning struck down ruthlessly!

The enormous force sent Gu Canghai flying!

“How... how is this possible?!” Seeing this heavenly tribulation, Gu Canghai’s eyes immediately widened!

He himself had also passed the heavenly tribulation of the Martial Marquis Realm, but that heavenly tribulation definitely didn’t have such powerful strength!

The scale of this heavenly tribulation was at least dozens of times more powerful than when Gu Canghai passed the heavenly tribulation!

The surrounding people were also stunned.

How was this like a tribulation? It was like the heavens wanted to chop him to death!

“Such a terrifying heavenly tribulation is really hard to imagine.” Gu Canghai narrowed his eyes and muttered in a low voice.

As a Martial Marquis, he naturally understood what such a terrifying heavenly tribulation meant.

The more talented one was, the more terrifying the power of the heavenly tribulation would be!

“If this kid doesn’t die, who knows how terrifying he will be in the future.” Gu Canghai narrowed his eyes and said.

He took a few steps back and sneered, “Well, I don’t believe you can withstand such a powerful heavenly tribulation.”

At this moment, the heavenly tribulation smashed down again!

This time, the heavenly tribulation was even more terrifying than before!

Gu Canghai couldn’t help but shout, “Let’s see how you will deal with it!”

Before he finished his words, Gu Canghai’s eyes widened!

He swallowed hard and said in a low voice, “What does Qin Yu want to do?!”

Qin Yu didn’t have any countermeasures. Instead, he sat cross-legged on the ground and allowed the silver light to pour down on his body!
