2086 Si Shiyue’s State of Mind

Si Qianjing’s words were full of threat and he did not hide it at all.

“Don’t worry. When Si Liuhe reaches the True Saint Realm, I will go to your Si family to congratulate him,” Dean Lei said with a smile.

After saying this, Dean Lei ignored the crowd. He turned around and left with Qin Yu.

Si Qianjing and the others only spoke after Dean Lei was far gone.

“I didn’t expect this Lei fellow to be still at his peak.”

“A True Saint at his peak… Who can provoke him?”

“Are we going to give up on this Traceless Immortal Scripture?”

“It’s impossible to give up. When a new Saint appears in the Si family, we will definitely ask for it.”

Everyone was silent. Having said that, they were quite worried deep down.

New Saints would appear in the Si family and other aristocratic families, but the rogue cultivators were not as lucky.

The more they dragged on, the fewer chances they had. Unless they could take another step forward at this critical moment and step into a higher realm, they could not own the Traceless Immortal Scripture.

…

At Thunder Courtyard, Qin Yu followed Dean Lei and sat in his temple.

Dean Lei looked rather relaxed as if nothing happened.

Qin Yu was a little worried.

Just as the Si family had said, if Si Liuhe reached the True Saint Realm, he would cause trouble for Dean Lei.

Si Liuhe was a top genius back then. He had once swept across the universe. If the dao technique did not prevent the appearance of True Saint, his strength would have been unfathomable long ago.

When he stepped into the True Saint Realm, no one knew if Dean Lei would be his match.

“You actually obtained the Traceless Immortal Scripture. It seems that you still have some ability,” Dean Lei said.

Qin Yu opened his mouth and smiled bitterly. “It was just luck. By the way, Dean Lei, where’s Jue Wu? Is she alright?”

Dean Lei pointed at a token not far away. Jue Wu’s name was written on the token.

“If anything happens to her, the token will shatter,” Dean Lei said.

“Besides, I’ve already made my move. I think the Si family should stop for a while.”

Jue Wu still had the demonic egg with her. Thus nothing should have happened.

“You can stay here for now,” Dean Lei said.

Qin Yu opened his mouth and then sighed.

He would not stay in Thunder Courtyard for long because it would definitely bring trouble to Thunder Courtyard.

However, Qin Yu had nowhere else to go. Thus he could only stay for the time being and take the opportunity to step into the Reversion to Void Stage, after which he would comprehend the Traceless Immortal Scripture.

That night, Qin Yu was not in a hurry to break through. Instead, he entered the world of the Traceless Immortal Scripture again.

This time, the scenes before Qin Yu’s eyes became even more mysterious and unfathomable. The scenes that appeared were practically the process of Wu Ji comprehending the dao and his several great battles.

Wu Ji in the great battle could be said to be invincible! He had never been defeated in his life.

From being unknown, unnoticed, and bullied everywhere he went in the beginning to the later stage, it was hard to imagine they were the same person.

After observing a few great battles, eight days went by.

For experts at Wu Ji’s level, a battle would last several days. Therefore, one would need at least a hundred years, if not a thousand years, if one wished to fully comprehend the Traceless Immortal Scripture

“If only I could choose for myself,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

At this moment, a bold idea suddenly appeared in Qin Yu’s mind.

“What if I split a wisp of my consciousness to explore the Traceless Immortal Scripture?” Qin Yu exclaimed in his heart.

If that were feasible, it would be much easier to comprehend the Traceless Immortal Scripture. And almost all of Qin Yu’s time could be spent on comprehending the Traceless Immortal Scripture!

This was the so-called multitasking. It was an incredibly difficult task for ordinary cultivators because they could not be disturbed when comprehending dao techniques. Otherwise, they might go berserk.

But to Qin Yu, this was possible. The Meridian Circulation Technique he had learned before was coincidentally the same!

Thinking of this, Qin Yu quickly extended a wisp of divine sense.

Golden Light the size of a grain of rice shot out from his glabella.

Golden Light approached the Traceless Immortal Scripture and slowly opened it.

In the next second, this divine sense entered the Traceless Immortal Scripture!

“It really works!” Qin Yu was instantly overjoyed!

This way, Qin Yu’s worries were gone, and he could even get twice the result with half the effort!

Using a wisp of divine sense to follow Wu Ji while using the true body for self-cultivation, this kind of cultivation method was rare in the world! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qin Yu was tremendously excited, and his eyes suddenly lit up!

“It’s settled then!” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

After that, his true body put away the Traceless Immortal Scripture, and he began his retreat to step into the Advanced-stage of Reversion to Void.

…

The news of Dean Lei taking action quickly spread.

It was undoubtedly a bombshell for the Holy Region!

The deterrence of a True Saint in his peak state was too terrifying. If Dean Lei went crazy and brought along Immortal Emperor Lei’s magical artifact to attack, even the nine aristocratic families would tremble in fear!

“Dean Lei has lived many years yet is still at his peak. His peers have almost all withered and are nearing the end of their life.”

“I’m afraid he has some secret technique or already reached the next cultivation realm.”

“Thunder Courtyard has stood tall for so many years. Who dares to attack them? Wasn’t that Dean Lei’s deterrence?”

“Have you forgotten someone? Flower Granny is also in Thunder Courtyard.”

Flower Granny was a name that had been silent for too many years. Now that she was mentioned, it was still ear-piercing.

Many people seemed to have forgotten about Flower Granny, but now that she was mentioned again, they seemed to have recalled Flower Grann’s terrifying and powerful strength.

“Flower Granny was once known as the number one genius in the world, a woman who had the potential to step into the Immortal Emperor realm.”

“That’s right. When she was at her peak, no one under the skies of the Holy Region seemed to be her match.”

“If it weren’t for the fact that she was plagued by emotions, no one could imagine the cultivation realm Flower Granny Hua would be in now.”

“However, Flower Granny is no longer at her peak. It is difficult to determine how much strength she still has.”

…

At the Si family, Si Qianjing told Si Shiyue everything.

“The Traceless Immortal Scripture is now in Qin Yu’s hands. He will definitely comprehend it in time. If Liuhe doesn’t come out of seclusion in time, we will probably miss it,” Si Qianjing said in a deep voice.

Si Shiyue’s expression was extremely calm, and it did not show any signs of panic.

“It’s fine to do without the Traceless Immortal Scripture. I, Si Shiyue, want to walk my own path,” Si Shiyue said calmly.

“After Master comes out of seclusion, I will no longer ask about the Si family’s matters. I plan to go into retreat.”

When he said this, S Qianjing could clearly see the dao technique flowing on Si Shiyue’s body as if the dao technique had taken a step further.

Not only did this matter not deal any blow to Si Shiyue, but it also gave him a new dao technique.
