Chapter 1157: Chapter 1,157: Qin Yu escaped! 

Seeing Chang Mang leave, someone immediately shouted, “Chang Mang, if you go now, you’re Courting Death!”

“Then let me die! Rather than live like this, it’s better to die in battle!”Chang Mang was extremely stubborn, and his entire body was filled with the desire to fight.

It was as if he was born to fight and didn’t know fear at all.

“Buzz!”

At this moment, an extremely holy light attacked from behind.

This light was like a large net, covering Chang Mang and stopping Chang Mang’s footsteps.

Chang Mang tried to break free, but he discovered that the more he broke free, the tighter this light became.

Turning around, he saw that the spellcaster was Yao Meng.

Yao Meng’s ten fingers erupted with a light that was like a spider web, covering Chang Mang and making him unable to move.

“Let go of me!”Chang Mang shouted angrily.

Yao Meng shook her head and said, “I can’t let you go and die.”

Chang Mang clenched his fists and said through gritted teeth, “Miss Yao, I don’t want to attack you, but don’t force me!”

Yao Meng was also extremely tough. She took a step forward and said, “Go ahead and attack. If you want to get out, kill me first.”

“Alright, you forced me to do this!”Chang Mang shouted loudly, and a blood-red light immediately erupted! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

This terrifying explosive force actually directly shattered the light!

He held a fist the size of a casserole and rushed towards Yao Meng!

“Stop!”

At this moment, the pavilion master suddenly blocked between the two of them.

She said with a cold face, “All of you stop. I’ll go ask the Dao Protector.”

Hearing these words, Chang Mang finally loosened his fist.

He looked at pavilion master and said, “Pavilion Master, is what you said true?”

“When have I ever lied to You?”Pavilion Master’s voice was somewhat cold.

“All of you stay in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. I’ll set off now to look for the Dao Protector.”

After saying this, pavilion master turned around and walked out of the door.

Everyone looked at pavilion master’s back and could not help but look at each other.

She... Really went to look for the Dao Protector? Didn’t they say that the Dao Protector was elusive? Was it really that easy to find him?

Although everyone had some doubts in their hearts, they also understood that this might be the only way at the moment.

...

In the first Mystic Realm, Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly and studied the fighting word formula.

Meanwhile, the surrounding higher-ups were still shouting and wailing incessantly.

Under this kind of pain, they had even lost the intention to live.

At the same time, they also somewhat admired Qin Yu.

This kid’s ability to adapt was simply abnormal!

Even if he was at the Almighty Realm, he was in so much pain that his entire body was covered in sweat, but this Qin Yu was actually able to study a spell in this kind of situation!

It was simply unheard of!

Yan Yongfu looked at Qin Yu, who had his eyes slightly closed, and couldn’t help but feel somewhat terrified.

No wonder he was able to overthrow the rule of the martial arts association of Jingdu with one hand. Such perseverance was truly unheard of.

“If this child doesn’t die, he will definitely become a great talent in the future.”Yan Yongfu could not help but sigh in his heart.

Qin Yu closed his eyes and continued to study the fighting formula.

This was bound to be a long project. He could not rush the matter of studying spells, so he could only take it slowly.

In the blink of an eye, five days had passed.

During these five days, thanks to Gu Xinghe’s hard work, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association was finally rebuilt.

Because of the participation of the reclusive mighty figures, the scale of the JINGDU martial arts association was even more prosperous than before, and its strength was even stronger!

With such powerful strength, even the officials began to worry.

With Gu Xinghe’s disorderly expansion, who knew what he would do in the future!

Most importantly, apart from the martial arts world, Gu Xinghe had also extended his hand into the various aristocratic families, combining it with capital.

This was definitely a hidden danger, a hidden danger with destructive factors!

Ye Qing sat in his office, his face extremely gloomy.

“Commander Ye, now that Qin Yu’s life and death are unknown, no one can go against Gu Xinghe,”someone reminded him from the side.

Ye Qing took a puff of his cigarette and did not say a word.

“If it really doesn’t work out, we might have to choose to negotiate with Gu Xinghe and then coexist,”someone suggested.

Ye Qing’s face turned cold. He waved his hand and berated, “Absolutely not! Absolutely not allowed!”

“For a person like Gu Xinghe, if he is given a little sunshine, he will be brilliant. Coexisting with him? Then he will have to show off!”

“Commander Ye, we are just stalling for time and delaying the war,”someone said.

“Yes, it is not a good thing to fall out with him at this time.”

Ye Qing could not help but clench his teeth. His fist smashed fiercely on the table, and the table immediately shattered.

“Qin Yu, are you really going to end it like this...”ye Qing’s eyes flickered and he let out a long sigh.

Back then, Jiang he also had the hope of uprooting the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, but in the end, he still failed.

Was the current Qin Yu going to repeat the same mistake.

...

In the first secret realm, Qin Yu was neither too fast nor too slow in comprehending the fighting character formula.

“Yan Yongfu, you despicable person,”a higher-up beside him said through gritted teeth.

“Everything started because of you. Now, you, the instigator, are going to be the first to run away!”

Yan Yongfu said indifferently, “When disaster strikes, we all fly separately. I can’t even protect myself. How can I Care About You?”

“Hehe, if I didn’t listen to your nonsense, this Gu Xinghe wouldn’t have obtained such power!”A higher-up said with a dark face.

“If we can’t live, don’t think that you can live well either!”

Yan Yongfu couldn’t be bothered with them. Whatever he said now was nonsense.

At this moment, the door suddenly opened.

Gu Xinghe, who hadn’t appeared for many days, finally came here today.

He put his hands behind his back and looked at the crowd.

Seeing their painful and exhausted appearance, Gu Xinghe was extremely satisfied.

He clapped his hands and said indifferently, “How is it? Does it feel good?”

The room was silent and no one spoke.

Gu xinghe laughed and said, “Those who bully others will be bullied by others! This is the price you should pay!”

“Gu Xinghe, I want to make a deal with you.”At this time, the only female higher-up among the eight said.

“Oh? Make a deal with me?”Gu Xinghe raised his eyebrows. He sized up the female higher-up and a trace of ridicule flashed in his eyes.

“What? You want to sell your body? Or your soul?”Gu Xinghe sneered.

The female executive glanced at Yan Yongfu and said, “I’ll tell you a secret in exchange for my life. How about it?”

“Oh? What Secret?”Gu Xinghe was slightly surprised.

The female executive said in a deep voice, “I can only promise you that this secret is very important to you. It involves your life.”

Gu Xinghe rubbed his chin. He sized up the female higher-up and said, “Alright. If this secret is really useful to me, I can consider letting you go.”

The female higher-up did not waste any words. She looked at Yan Yongfu coldly and said, “He has an agreement with Qin Yu! He is thinking of a way to escape! Moreover, Yan Yongfu has Yan Ruoxue’s blood on him!”
