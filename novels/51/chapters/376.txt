Seeing Qin Yu regain his confidence, Old Mister Yan also smiled in relief. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Old Mister Yan, you should go and rest,” said Qin Yu.

He didn’t want to waste any more time and was prepared to enter seclusion as soon as possible.

During this period of time, not only did Qin Yu accumulate large quantities of herbs, but his mental state also improved greatly.

As long as he had enough time, Qin Yu would be able to improve his strength as soon as possible.

Old Mister Yan nodded. He didn’t waste Qin Yu’s time and turned around to leave.

It was late at night.

Under the illumination of the moonlight, a young man was sitting cross-legged.

A faint internal qi was lingering around his body. This internal qi was the purest internal spiritual energy.

He sat for the entire night.

The next morning, Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes.

The pharmacist in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion had brought breakfast early on.

Taozi and Yao Qing wolfed down the food, but Qin Yu had no desire to eat.

“Mr. Qin, please have a bite,” Yao Qing said as he stuffed food into his mouth.

Qin Yu shook his head. He turned around and walked out of the Elders’ Residence and towards the pavilion in the valley.

This was the residence of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s Pavilion Master.

Standing under this pavilion, Qin Yu took a deep breath and shouted, “I am paying my respect to the Pavilion Master!”

His voice reverberated in the valley. Qin Yu’s eyes looked up at the towering pavilion in the sky.

“Elder Qin, please come up.” Not long after, a voice came from above.

Qin Yu’s feet shook and he quickly landed in the attic.

Two pharmacists who were responsible for taking care of the Pavilion Master bowed and said, “The Pavilion Master is waiting for you in the room.”

“Thank you,” Qin Yu said politely.

Then, Qin Yu strode into the room.

He didn’t see the Pavilion Master in the room.

Behind a curtain, he could see the Pavilion Master’s figure.

She seemed to be taking a medicinal bath. Even through the gauze curtain, he could still see her graceful figure.

“What’s the matter?” The Pavilion Master’s voice came from behind the gauze curtain.

Qin Yu said, “Lord Pavilion Master, I want to make a deal with you.”

“Oh really?” The Pavilion Master was somewhat surprised.

The sound of water droplets could be heard. Then, he saw the Pavilion Master put on a long robe and stroll out.

There were still water droplets on her body. A medicinal fragrance and bodily fragrance fused together and assaulted his nostrils.

“You want to make a deal with me?” The Pavilion Master, her eyes carrying a hint of playfulness, raised her eyebrows.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, I can give my pill formulas to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

“Pill formulas?” The Pavilion Master’s lips curled into a playful smile.

“Do you think the Divine Alchemist Pavilion lacks pill formulas?”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “I know that the Divine Alchemist Pavilion has the world’s most complete pill formulas, but the Divine Alchemist Pavilion might not have what I have.”

“Tell me about it,” the Pavilion Master said indifferently.

Qin Yu immediately revealed the names of several kinds of pills. These pills were all Divine Rank pills, and some of them were even top-grade Divine Rank pills.

After the Pavilion Master heard it, there wasn’t much surprise on her face.

She glanced at Qin Yu and said, “Hmm, the pill formulas aren’t bad. Then what do you want?”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “First, I need large quantities of herbs.”

The Pavilion Master nodded, indicating for Qin Yu to continue.

“Second, I want the Elders of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion to refine pills for me. Of course, I will provide the pill formulas,” Qin Yu said.

Qin Yu didn’t have much time left. The strong sense of urgency made Qin Yu dare not to waste a single second.

Refining pills by himself was indeed too time-consuming and a waste of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s resources.

When the Pavilion Master heard this, she couldn’t help but laugh.

She sized up Qin Yu and said, “You thought this out well.”

Qin Yu forced a smile and said, “Pavilion Master, I have no other choice. You know that time is pressing. I hope that you will agree.”

The Pavilion Master stretched lazily and said, “Let me think about it.”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and said, “Pavilion Master, time is of the essence. I can’t afford to delay. You...”

“I said, I’ll think about it.” Pavilion Master’s expression instantly turned cold.

Qin Yu opened his mouth and couldn’t help but force a smile.

This woman really turned hostile just like that.

“Then I’ll have to trouble you, Lord Pavilion Master.” Qin Yu cupped his hands and didn’t stay any longer. He turned around and left the pavilion.

After Qin Yu left, the Pavilion Master looked at the two pharmacist staff members at the door.

“Go call the First Elder over.” The Pavilion Master said indifferently.

“Yes, Lord Pavilion Master.” The two pharmacist staff members bowed and then turned around to leave.

A few minutes later, the First Elder walked in a hurry and arrived at the Pavilion Master’s building.

“Lord Pavilion Master.” The First Elder cupped his hands.

“Inform all the Elders to refine pills for Qin Yu. The herbs will be taken from the warehouse,” said the Pavilion Master.

The First Elder was stunned. He frowned and said, “Lord Pavilion Master, don’t we still need to consider this matter?”

“Selling pills is the main source of income for the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. We have a lot of orders now. If all the Elders refine pills for Qin Yu, it will definitely hurt the Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s revenue,” said the First Elder with a frown.

The Pavilion Master glanced at the First Elder coldly and said, “Then cancel all the orders. The Divine Alchemist Pavilion can afford to delay it for a mere half a year.”

The First Elder didn’t dare to say anything more. He immediately nodded and said, “Yes, Lord Pavilion Master.”

On the same day, all the Elders received the news.

More than ten Elders arrived at Qin Yu’s Elders’ Residence at the same time.

At this moment, Qin Yu was meditating and cultivating. In front of him were the newly refined Vitality Enhancing Pills.

More than ten Vitality Enhancing Pills actually didn’t allow Qin Yu to step into the third level of the Monastic Stage.

The consumption was indeed shocking.

“Elder Qin.”

At this moment, the First Elder interrupted Qin Yu’s cultivation.

Qin Yu opened his eyes, quickly stood up, cupped his hands and said, “Greetings, First Elder.”

“Everyone is waiting for you. Don’t waste time,” said the First Elder.

After saying this, the First Elder turned around and walked out.

Qin Yu walked out of the room with some doubts.

As soon as he walked out, he saw all the Elders gathered here.

“Elder Qin, under the Order of the Pavilion Master, we are here to refine a pill for Elder Qin,” said the First Elder.

“That’s right, Elder Qin. If there’s anything you need us to do, feel free to ask.”

Qin Yu was instantly overjoyed. He bowed deeply to everyone and said, “Thank you all for your help. I, Qin Yu, will never forget your great kindness.”

“Elder Qin, if you want to thank someone, go thank the Pavilion Master. We are just following orders,” said the Fifth Elder with a smile.

Qin Yu nodded his head vigorously. He hurriedly took out the remaining herbs from his Spatial Magic Artifact.

“Everyone, please wait a moment. I will write down the pill formulas,” Qin Yu said hurriedly.

“Elder Qin, don’t underestimate the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. You only need to tell us the name of the pills,” The First Elder said indifferently.

“That’s right. After all, we are the elites of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. Why do we need to go through so much trouble?”
