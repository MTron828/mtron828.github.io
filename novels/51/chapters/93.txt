Chapter 94: Yan Ruoxue Accompanies Qin Yu Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

This was also one of the reasons why Yan Yongxiu agreed to Qin Yu.

The next day, after Yan Ruoxue woke up, she drove out of the hotel.

She and Yan Yongxiu had agreed to meet in the provincial capital three days later.

As for these three days, Yan Ruoxue wanted to accompany Qin Yu. No matter what Qin Yu did, she would accompany him.

After Yan Ruoxue left, Yan Yongxiu stood upstairs and watched the car slowly drive away.

“Yan Jiang, get a few people to secretly protect Ruoxue’s safety,” Yan Yongxiu took a puff of his cigar and said indifferently.

“Yes, President Yan.” Yan Jiang nodded and then walked out.

The car soon arrived at the entrance of Qin Yu’s hotel. After asking for the room number, she went straight upstairs.

As soon as she entered the room, Yan Ruoxue said with a smile, “Qin Yu, are you still...”

Before she could finish her words, Yan Ruoxue’s expression turned cold.

It was because she saw countless scars all over Qin Yu’s body! And his face was swollen beyond recognition!

Yan Ruoxue’s expression was extremely cold. She looked at Qin Yu and said coldly, “Who did it?”

Qin Yu waved his hand and said with a smile, “I’m fine. I accidentally bumped into something.”

“I’m asking you who did it?!” Yan Ruoxue’s tone of voice became even colder. Even Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel intimidated.

Qin Yu didn’t know how to explain. He couldn’t say that it was Yan Yongxiu who did it, right?

Unfortunately, Yan Ruoxue was so smart that she quickly guessed who it was.

“It was my dad, wasn’t it?” Yan Ruoxue looked at Qin Yu and asked.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything, which was an acquiescence.

Yan Ruoxue was instantly furious. She took out her phone and was about to call Yan Yongxiu.

Qin Yu quickly stopped her and shook his head. “Miss Yan, don’t blame Mr. Yan. To be honest, I’m... very grateful to him.”

“Very grateful?” Yan Ruoxue was stunned, as if she didn’t understand what Qin Yu meant.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “It’s true. He promised to give me a year to prove myself.”

Even though that was the case, Yan Ruoxue was still a little displeased.

She reached out and touched Qin Yu’s face, then said with heartache, “How could he beat you up like this? This is too outrageous.”

“It doesn’t hurt, really.” Qin Yu shook his head and said.

“Silly.” Yan Ruoxue rolled her eyes at Qin Yu.

Then, she called the front desk, and soon, the front desk delivered the medicine.

“Sit here obediently and bear with the pain,” Yan Ruoxue said while holding the medicine.

Qin Yu looked a little embarrassed, but he felt extremely warm to the heart.

Since childhood, Qin Yu had been bullied countless times, but no one had ever cared if he was in pain, and no one had ever applied ointment on him.

Yan Ruoxue’s appearance made Qin Yu feel heartened again and again.

He sat by the bed obediently while receiving Yan Ruoxue’s gentle care.

Yan Ruoxue took the medicine and carefully applied it on Qin Yu’s wound.

“Does it hurt?” Yan Ruoxue asked carefully as she applied the medicine on Qin Yu.

Qin Yu quickly said, “No... it doesn’t hurt.”

Their close distance made Qin Yu extremely nervous.

The subtle fragrance on Yan Ruoxue’s body almost made Qin Yu swoon.

He took a deep breath and carefully sniffed Yan Ruoxue’s fragrant scent.

On Yan Ruoxue’s aloof and beautiful face, there was only worry and heartache at this moment. Qin Yu couldn’t help but grin.

“You’re beaten black and blue, yet you’re still smiling.” Yan Ruoxue rolled her eyes.

Qin Yu scratched his head and smiled embarrassedly.

After applying the medicine, Yan Ruoxue drove Qin Yu out to eat.

After the meal, Yan Ruoxue asked, “Do you have any plans for the next few days?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I do. I heard that there’s an auction in South City. It should be tonight.”

“South City’s auction? What do you want to buy?” Yan Ruoxue couldn’t help but feel a little surprised.

“I want to try my luck and see if there are any top-grade herbs,” Qin Yu said with an embarrassed smile.

Yan Ruoxue nodded and said in a low voice, “The auction in South City is quite famous. I’ve heard about it in Jingdu.”

“Then how about this? Let’s set off now and go to South City!” Yan Ruoxue immediately started the car and sped towards South City.

At this moment, the entire provincial capital was discussing the fall of the Shen family. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

As a prominent family in Chuzhou, the Shen family soon made the headlines when this incident happened.

The news was even more sensational. Almost all the headlines were criticism of the Shen family.

For example, “The Ten Crimes of the Shen Family”, “The Negative Impact of the Shen family on Chuzhou” and so on.

The Shen family’s reputation was so bad that everyone cursed them.

Those who once had ties with the Shen family also hurriedly distanced themselves for fear that they would get implicated.

...

South City was a coastal city.

The people there were affluent and the environment was beautiful. It was an excellent place for cultivation.

Qin Yu now had two billion in loans, so he wasn’t too worried.

After five hours, the car finally arrived at South City.

As soon as he got out of the car, Qin Yu couldn’t help but take a deep breath.

Compared to the provincial capital, the air in South City was unbelievably fresh!

Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly and tried to feel the surrounding spiritual energy.

As expected, the spiritual energy in South City far surpassed that of Jiangcheng and the provincial capital!

It was really the prime spot. He must come to South City to settle down when he had the chance, Qin Yu thought to himself.

It was already past six o’clock in the afternoon, and the auction would start at eight o’clock in the evening.

Therefore, Yan Ruoxue suggested, “Let’s find a place to eat first. What do you want to eat?”

As a man, how could Qin Yu have the nerve to actually say what he wanted to eat? Therefore, he shook his head and said, “Anything is fine.”

Yan Ruoxue gently patted Qin Yu’s head and rolled her eyes. “Just say what you want to eat. Don’t be shy like a little girl.”
