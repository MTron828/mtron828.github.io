“Have you seen them?” Xiao Sheng asked in surprise.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Someone called Chao Cang invited me to Xihuang but I rejected.”

“Rejected? Why did you reject?” Xiao Sheng raised his eyebrows and said.

Qin Yu didn’t know how to answer for a moment, so he stammered and said, “Maybe I don’t like their attitudes.”

“Xihuang and Donghuang are the same. It’s a wasteland and you may find things that you want there, such as dark energy,” Xiao Sheng said.

“So, you should go.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “If I go, wouldn’t you mind?”

“Me? Why would I mind?” Xiao Sheng said in surprise.

He then sighed and said, “You’re like my younger brother. You always like to be a drama king. You always think of what others think. Aren’t you tired?

“Moreover, who cares about you? Wherever you go is your freedom. Don’t you have the right to be free?”

Xiao Sheng’s words made Qin Yu speechless.

“Maybe I just don’t feel like going,” Qin Yu could only say helplessly.

Xiao Sheng smiled and said, “You will go. I can make a bet with you.”

Qin Yu laughed and say, “Aren’t you a little overconfident? It’s up to me whether I want to go.”

“So do you dare to bet with me?” Xiao Sheng asked. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Qin Yu said, “What do you want to bet on?”

Xiao Sheng thought for a moment and said, “Let’s bet on the time. I’ll bet on you for a month.

“If I lose, I will follow you for a month. If you lose, you have to follow me for a month, and listen to everything I say.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. For a moment, he could not figure out Xiao Sheng’s intentions.

However, in Qin Yu’s opinion, he would not lose at all. So so he nodded and agreed.

Seeing that Qin Yu agreed, Xiao Sheng stood up and said indifferently, “If you want dark energy, you must go to Xihuang.”

“I can choose North Plain, and there is a high chance that I will choose North Plain,” Qin Yu said with confidence.

Xiao Sheng looked at Qin Yu and said, “You can’t go to North Plain.”

“Can’t go? Why?” Qin Yu asked in puzzlement.

Xiao Sheng replied, “Because Yuan Xiu has resurrected.”

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically when he heard this!

He stood up abruptly and said with a frown, “So fast… doesn’t that mean he will come to look for you soon?”

Xiao Sheng did not answer Qin Yu. Instead, he said, “It’s not strict enough to say that he has resurrected. Strictly speaking, it’s his clone that has resurrected. Its strength is not as strong as his true body.”

“Clone again?” Qin Yu was stunned.

“It’s different from the previous clone. This time, although Yuan Xiu’s clone is not as strong as his true body, it is still at the Reversion Void Stage,” Xiao Sheng said.

Qin Yu was stunned. He was silent for a moment before he suddenly said, “Is this the reason why you are unwilling to step into the Reversion Void Stage? Did you already know that his clone would be the first to resurrect?”

“That’s right.” Xiao Sheng nodded.

“If I were to face the fully resurrected true body, I have no chance of winning. But for the clone, I might be able to,” Xiao Sheng said calmly.

Qin Yu could not help but mutter, “Why didn’t you say it earlier…”

Xiao Sheng raised his eyebrows and smiled, “So do you still not go to Xihuang?”

Qin Yu opened his mouth, feeling a little helpless.

If that was the case, Xihuang seemed to be the only place that he could go.

The moment he stepped into North Plain, he would surely die.

“Sigh! A bet is a bet,” Qin Yu said somewhat helplessly.

Xiao Sheng laughed out loud. He patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “Don’t be discouraged. I’ve never lost a bet.”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes at Xiao Sheng but was lost for words for a moment.

“You haven’t answered my question yet. Why do the people of Xihuang want to kill you?” Qin Yu asked.

Xiao Sheng said in a deep voice, “In the past, there were only three places in Lizhou. They are Nanzhou, East Continent, and the Thunder Courtyard.

“The most vicious people from these three places were exiled to North Plain, which has resulted in the current situation of North Plain.

“Xihuang is a place where a group of losers fled. From then on, Xihuang emerged.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly, waiting for Xiao Sheng to continue.

Xiao Sheng continued, “Chao Cang was one of the defeated losers. His eldest brother’s name is Chao Shou. He was defeated too.

“Back then, the two brothers almost died in the hands of Xiao Hai and me. After they escaped by luck, they went to Xihuang.

“Their strength was not bad, to begin with. Now, they will naturally take the opportunity to take revenge.”

Qin Yu understood now.

“The two brothers lost to the two of you,” Qin Yu muttered.

Xiao Sheng nodded slightly and continued, “But their strength is not comparable to Yuan Xiu. That’s why I never take them seriously.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “But their methods don’t look weak. That face in the sky that day was definitely not something an ordinary person could do.”

Xiao Sheng snorted and said, “It’s just a trick to fool people. It’s not worth mentioning. It’s just a fancy thing.”

Seeing this, Qin Yu jokingly said, “Then you have to be more careful. They may attack you at the same time.”

Just as the two of them were talking, the voice of the Deputy Sect Master suddenly sounded.

“Qin Yu, Yong Ji has gone to North Plain. He is now clamoring to fight with you,” the Deputy Sect Master shouted outside the Cultivation Mountain.

Qin Yu was stunned for a moment before he asked in surprise, “How did he recover from such a serious injury so quickly?”

“It’s Yuan Xiu’s technique. To be precise, it’s the secret technique of the Immortal Slaying Sect,” Xiao Sheng said.

“Relatively speaking, Yuan Xiu’s technique is much stronger than that of the Chao brothers,” Xiao Sheng said with a sigh.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “After all, he has obtained the inheritance of the Immortal Slaying Sect.”

“So are you going?” Xiao Sheng asked.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Of course, I’m going. Otherwise, wouldn’t I be ridiculed by others?”

“Do you think you are the current Yong Ji’s match?” Xiao Sheng sized Qin Yu up.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Of course not, but I still want to go.”

“Why?” Xiao Sheng asked in puzzlement.

Qin Yu joked, “So there are things that you don’t know. You’d better guess it yourself.”

Qin Yu stood up as he spoke. He patted away the dirt on his backside and said goodbye to Xiao Sheng before leaving the Tianyun Sect.

At the North Plain.

Yong Ji seemed to have resumed his usual imposing manner. He stood there with his arms crossed in front of his chest, looking as pretentious as he wanted to be.

The surrounding people did not dare to come forward. They all hid in the shadows, afraid of dying in Yong Ji’s hands.

“D*mn it! This Yong Ji is really shameless. A cultivator at the Reversion Void Stage is actually challenging Qin Yu.”

“If he’s not shameless, he wouldn’t be called Yong Ji anymore.”

“Do you think Qin Yu will come?”

“Come my a*s! Will he come to court for death? As long as he’s not insane, he definitely won’t come.”

“That’s right. When there is life, there is hope.”

Yong Ji waited for Qin Yu’s arrival with his hands behind his back.

He opened his eyes slightly and said coldly, “Qin Yu, how much longer do you want to hide?”
