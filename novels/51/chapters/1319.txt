Chapter 1320: Chapter 1,320, what was hidden in the mountains 

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered to explain to ah San.

Wan ‘er, who was beside him, said softly, “These two places are filled with danger. It’s good that we have someone to take care of us.”

AH SAN sneered, “Take care of us? What can he take care of us? Miss Wan ‘er, do you think I need him to take care of me?”

Qin Yu glanced at him and sneered, “Okay, don’t worry. I promise I won’t help you.”

“Hehe, I don’t need it. I just hope that you won’t beg me to save you when the time comes.”Ah San snorted coldly.

Qin Yu didn’t continue to argue with him. It was meaningless in itself.

The next day.

When Qin Yu went out, Ah San and Wan ‘er were already waiting at the door.

“You sure are slow-witted. You Can’t even catch up to the heat when you eat SH * t,”Ah San mocked.

Qin Yu ignored him and looked at Wan ‘Er. “Is everything ready?”

Wan ‘er nodded slightly and said, “I brought a magical artifact from home, but with my current status at home, I can’t bring any top-notch magical artifacts.”

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “No worries. When the time comes, we’ll act according to the circumstances. If it really doesn’t work, we’ll find an opportunity to escape.”

“Okay,”Wan ‘er agreed. “Then let’s set off.”

The place they had decided on for the time being was the mountain range behind Yang City.

There wasn’t a complete road from Yang City to this mountain range. The three of them had to crawl.

After spending half a day, they finally arrived at the top of this mountain range.

The entire mountain range stretched for thousands of miles, and it could be said to be magnificent.

Looking at it from afar, it looked like a dragon’s spine.

The top of the mountain range was uneven and there were all kinds of trees that could not be named.

“What is hidden here? Why are the people of Yang City so afraid?”Qin Yu scanned the mountain range and said in a low voice.

Ah San frowned and said, “I can’t feel the slightest surge of internal Qi.”

Qin Yu immediately activated the desolate God’s eye, intending to investigate.

Unfortunately, he did not notice anything unusual under the desolate God’s eye.

“Forget about him. Let’s go,”Qin Yu said.

With that, he looked at ah San and said, “AH San, take care of your miss.”

“There’s no need for you to say anything,”AH San said coldly.

Qin Yu could not be bothered with AH SAN. He took a step forward, intending to step into the mountain range.

But at this moment, a figure suddenly appeared.

He raised his head and saw that it was Chen Cang.

He looked coldly at Qin Yu and the others with an extremely displeased expression.

“Old Mister Chen, why are you here?”

Seeing Chen Cang, Qin Yu couldn’t help but be surprised.

Chen Cang snorted coldly and said, “I knew you guys would definitely come here. What a bunch of stubborn fellows.”

Qin Yu and Wan ‘Er’s faces revealed a trace of embarrassment.

As for Ah San, he said coldly, “What has it got to do with you?”

Chen Cang glanced at Ah San and said indifferently, “Young people should have a heart of reverence and at least know how to be polite.”

Ah San opened his mouth and wanted to say something, but was stopped by Wan ‘Er.

She bowed and said, “Old Mister Chen, I know that you are doing this for our good, but this life qi is extremely important to us. If we don’t get it, we will be crippled forever.”

“If I want to be crippled forever, then I’d rather die.”

Chen Cang glanced at Qin Yu, as if asking for Qin Yu’s opinion.

Qin Yu also said in a deep voice, “I think so too.”

Chen Cang sighed slightly and said, “In that case, I have nothing more to say.”

Then, Chen Cang’s mind moved, and two pieces of armor appeared in front of them. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

There were traces of sharp blades on the armor. Looking carefully, some of the traces were very deep, almost penetrating the armor.

“Put this on. It might be able to save your lives at the critical moment,”said Chen Cang.

“The only pity is that I only have two sets.”

Hearing this, Ah San hurriedly snatched the two sets of armor, as if he was afraid that Qin Yu would take them away.

“AH SAN!”Wan ‘er’s expression was extremely displeased.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “I don’t need this thing.”

“Hehe, you can still act tough.”Ah San sneered.

Chen Cang also said in a deep voice, “Qin Yu, without the armor, it will be difficult for you to walk out of this mountain range.”

Qin Yu didn’t know how to explain for a moment.

Although the armor looked indestructible, Qin Yu didn’t think it would surpass his physical body.

“Old Mister Chen, you don’t have to worry about me. I have my own countermeasures,”Qin Yu cupped his hands and said.

“Young Master Qin, I’ll give you my armor,”Wan ‘er said as she stretched out her hand.

“Miss!”AH SAN’s expression changed. He stretched out his hand to stop her, but Wan ‘er was extremely stubborn.

She said coldly, “If you insist, I’d rather not wear it.”

Ah San gritted his teeth. He handed the armor in his hand to Qin Yu and said coldly, “I’ll give it to you!”

Qin Yu looked at Wan ‘er and smiled. “Miss Wan ‘er, thank you for your kindness, but I really don’t need it.”

With that, Qin Yu cupped his hands to Chen Cang and said, “Old Mister Chen, it seems that the life Qi really exists in this mountain range.”

Chen Cang did not deny it. He only sighed slightly.

Qin Yu continued, “Old Mr. Chen, we are about to enter this mountain range. Can you tell us what is hidden in this mountain range?”
