Chapter 2764: Taoist Priest’s Peak Power

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Oh right, there’s one more thing.”

Cang Yunzi stopped Qin Yu, who was about to leave.

“If you intend to fight for the position of the Holy Lord, you have to pay special attention to this news. When we entered the Heavenly Sin, the power of the seventh, eighth, and ninth Heart of Saint Kingdom was lost. Holy Daughter Meng Jing was unable to defeat the person who stole the power and was heavily injured!”

What the he*l!

Qin Yu was shocked. He remembered Meng Jing’s four-dimensional power of God’s Space.

That kind of power was almost invincible vet she was unable to stop the

person. Then how powerful was the person who stole the Saint Power?

“Don’t be surprised. The awakening of the peak power above level 9 can amplify one’s power a thousand times greater. Strategies and restraints are particularly important under such power. Therefore, there is still a possibility of defeating a powerful holy daughter. Of course, the person’s strength is not simple to be able to heavily injure Meng Jing.”

Cang Yunzi seemed to have read Qin Yu’s mind and explained in detail. “Come, let’s have a battle. Maybe you’ll gain some comprehension.”

Without waiting for Qin Yu to respond, Cang Yunzi’s sleeve had already enveloped him.

Such a heavy force!

Qin Yu pushed himself up with both hands. Both parties didn’t use holy energy.

However, Qin Yu still felt a mountain-like gravity.

The moment Qin Yu blocked the force, he felt an invincible power erupt.

His face was filled with shock and he instantly leaped into the air.

He stomped hard on Cang Yunzi’s sleeve and used this force to retreat.

Qin Yu continued to use Ling Bo in the air. At this moment, he moved Ling Bo with his physical body.

His speed was so fast that even his shadow could not be caught.

Cang Yunzi stood on the spot. He did not move at all. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He smiled.

“Your physical strength is very strong. If I were to fight you with my physical strength, I’m afraid I would also be defeated.”

Suddenly, his robe let out a sharp whistle.

The robe suddenly stretched as if it had locked onto Qin Yu’s internal qi.

It arrived around Qin Yu at an extremely fast speed. After that, the robe did not directly attack Qin Yu.

Instead, it shuttled through the surroundings and divided the battle area into several areas.

“I can’t let it touch me.”

Cold sweat oozed out from Qin Yu’s temples.

The force just now could have seriously injured him, but he didn’t want to use his power of dream.

This was a trial between the two of them. It would be meaningless to use the Night Qi.

Although the power of Qian Kun was strong in the sleeve, he could still catch the speed.

Even if the space was compressed to the extreme, he was confident that it wouldn’t touch him.

“Observe again!”

Fleeing Shadow!

Qin Yu once again pulled his body to the other side, dodging the sleeve that was like a sharp sword.

His entire body came to a halt as he was traveling at high speed.

Then, he forcefully regained his senses at an unbelievable angle and punched out fiercely.

Behind him, Cang Yunzi appeared right behind Qin Yu.

He had been locking onto Cang Yunzi’s internal qi, even when he was hiding from Qian Kun in the sleeve.

What a fast reaction!

Cang Yunzi revealed a smile.

Their fists collided and a cold power suddenly wrapped around their arms.

It pierced Qin Yu’s throat, making him unable to make a sound.

“This is my peak power. I have comprehended the Dao technique of Heaven and Earth since I was young. I derived this peak power. It is also known as the Power of Qian Kun. The Qian Kun in the sleeve is just a smokescreen. When I use the Qian Kun in the seve, you might think that is my Power of Qian Kun. This will make you lose the opportunity to win.”

Cang Yunzi smiled as he retracted the power.

“Taoist priest, this isn’t your full strength, right? I understand.”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment. This was the first time he had fought with an expert with peak power.

He had indeed gained a lot from this battle.

“You have to know that when one reaches Dao Realm level 10 and awakens peak power, they won’t let you easily discover their true power. When they fight, they will set up fake and real power. You’ll have to discover the true killing intent. Thus, strength, strategy, thinking, and battle are all indispensable in a battle above Dao Realm level 10. Of course, your top priority now is to awaken your peak power. Otherwise, everything will be empty talk.”

Qin Yu cupped his fists. Cang Yunzi was indeed teaching him diligently.

After finding a remote place to stay, Qin Yu sighed slightly.

Whether it was Reiya or Cang Yunzi, they both pointed out the importance of peak power. How could this power be awakened?

According to Lord Alester, the awakening of this power was a matter of course.

An opportunity was needed. The best chance was in the Heavenly Sin.

However, Qin Yu did not gain anything from it. This made him feel a huge pressure.

If he couldn’t awaken this power in the Heavenly Sin, how could he awaken it now?

Qin Yu sat quietly for a long time until he had completely calmed down.

He had just entered cultivation when he realized that the Night Qi gathered in his chest had disappeared.

It was replaced by the power of the dream of his holy energy, which spread throughout his body.

Qin Yu was slightly surprised. This power was more than three times stronger than before.

He had forcefully entered the dreams of more than twenty people at the same time in the Heavenly Sin. The power of the night he had absorbed was so exaggerated. However, this was not without a price.

If it wasn’t for Yan Ruoxue who was in the fourth layer of the Heavenly Sin, he would never have been able to return to reality.

Moreover, his soul power was already at a terrifying stage.

His soul power was almost viscous. The enormous power could cover an area of about a thousand meters. It seemed to have undergone a huge transformation.

One had to know that entering the dream was equivalent to experiencing a long period of divine sense cultivation.

The experience in the Heavenly Sin had already made his soul power terrifyingly powerful.

Overall, his power of the night and divine soul had been greatly strengthened. He placed his right thumb on the Soul Suppression Ring and his body directly entered the passageway.

Balls of ghost-fire-like energy floated in the air of the passage.

The power was peaceful and stable. Each ball was about the same size.

Was this the power of Heavenly Sin? However, it seemed different from what he had observed inside.

When he entered the Tomb of Heavenly Sins, he saw many incantations.

However, these powers did not possess those familiar tombstone curses.

Moreover, Qin Yu felt that the arrangement of these ghost flames was very strange. It was not random like the power of the Eight Trigrams before.

Instead, it seemed to move rhythmically. That feeling gave him was similar to a formation.

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

The flame suddenly trembled and a wave of energy swept up..
