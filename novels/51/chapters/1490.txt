Chapter 1491: Chapter 1,491, the Hidden Tianyun sect 1

Looking at Hua Zi’s frivolous appearance, Qin Yu couldn’t help but smile and say, “Alright, what I’m about to do is.”

Hua Zi nodded slightly and said, “Life and death are determined by fate. I hope your luck is not bad.”

Qin Yu said, “I’ll return the same words to you.”

When Hua Zi heard this, he couldn’t help but sneer and say, “Qin Yu, the people in the world have overestimated you. They think that with your little ability, you can rule the world because they have never seen a true expert.”

“In my eyes, you, Qin Yu, are worthless. I can crush you to death with my hands.”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said, “Why do you have to say such rubbish? When the time comes, we will see who is the real deal.”

Hua Zi snorted coldly. Then, he looked at Jue Wu and said, “Lord Jue Wu, I hope you won’t Protect Qin Yu when the time comes. If he dies by my hands accidentally, I will come and apologize to you.”

“Go to Hell. Go back and tell Yongji that if you die, I promise to drink wine and eat meat on your grave,”Jue Wu said with a roll of her eyes.

Hua Zi snorted coldly. He didn’t say anything more and turned around to leave Hua Ning mountain.

Qin Yu caressed the letter of challenge, feeling a little suspicious for a moment.

Qin Yu had never seen this hua zi before. Why would he suddenly come to challenge him?

“This must be Yongji’s intention,”Jue Wu said with a cold snort.

“Yongji’s intention?”Qin Yu was a little surprised.

Jue Wu grunted and said, “Yongji hasn’t done much in the past few years. Today, he suddenly sent someone to challenge you. I’m afraid he has some evil plans.”

Qin Yu also had some doubts. He always felt that this Yongji didn’t seem like a good person. He was a bit of a hypocrite.

Especially after the last meeting, Qin Yu’s impression of him was extremely bad.

“Where is he meeting you?”Jue Wu asked.

Qin Yu opened the letter of challenge and took a look. He said, “It’s a place called... Yin Palace.”

“Yin Palace? Never heard of it.”Jue Wu shook his head.

“What’s the time?”

“Three days later.”

Jue Wu frowned and said, “Three days? Is there enough time?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “There’s no such thing as too much time. There’s no need to make any preparations to deal with a nobody.”

Jue Wu said in a deep voice, “Qin Yu, don’t underestimate his foster sons. Rumor has it that each of Yongji’s foster sons is a top genius in the South Province.”

“Not only that, Yongji has cultivated for so many years and can be said to have a unique skill. Not to mention that his foster son has mastered it, he should have at least a 70-80% chance. Don’t underestimate him.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I know. Speaking of which, I also want to see so for myself the abilities of these three madmen and three unique skills. Right now, I don’t have the qualifications to fight with Yong Ji, so I’ll use his disciple as an example.”

Jue Wu didn’t say anything, but she had already made up her mind:

If Qin Yu really couldn’t defeat Hua Zi, she would definitely save him.

As for Jue Wu, she didn’t care about morality and morality. She would save him first.

After that, Qin Yu went straight to the cultivation room.

There were still ten nascent soul pills left. Three days should be enough time.

The only thing that made Qin Yu feel regretful was that after swallowing ninety nascent soul pills, it was still not enough to support him to step into the mighty realm. He didn’t even recover to his peak condition.

Obviously, Qin Yu had underestimated the spiritual power that his body needed.

“What a pity.”Qin Yu sighed.

Of course, Qin Yu also understood the reason.

With his physique, if he could not achieve a balance between yin and yang, he would need a large amount of spiritual Qi to cultivate.

“If I can find a dark energy grave, I think my cultivation will be much faster,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He planned to find a dark energy grave to enter seclusion after the battle ended and strive to step into the mighty realm in one go.

In the outside world, news of Huazi issuing a challenge to Qin Yu quickly spread.

Everyone didn’t know the name Huazi, but they were rather shocked by the title of Mr. Yongji’s foster son.

For so many years, Yongji and his foster son had always kept a low profile and hardly participated in any disputes.

Now, they suddenly took the initiative to issue a challenge to Qin Yu, which was shocking.

“It seems that Yongji’s foster sons are planning to come out.”

“Yeah, if more than a hundred foster sons come out, they will definitely be an extraordinary force.”

“It can’t be helped. Who told Qin Yu to be so powerful? Yongji’s foster sons probably won’t be able to sit still.”

For a time, there were different opinions, but everyone was full of curiosity about this battle.

Qin Yu’s reputation was needless to say. He had almost never lost a battle.

When facing people of the same generation, he was almost instantly killed.

And there was no need to say anything more about Mister Yong Ji’s name. He was one of the three lunatics and three uniques, and his strength was unfathomable.

Yong Ji City.

Hua Zi was preparing for this battle.

As the saying goes, know your enemy, know your own, and you will never be defeated in a hundred battles. Hua Zi counted all of Qin Yu’s moves.

“When this kid fights, he almost always relies on his physical body. As long as you don’t let him get close, he has no chance of winning,”hua zi said in a low voice. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Yong Ji had a different view on this. He said in a deep voice, “Although Qin Yu has experienced many big battles, he hasn’t displayed many moves. No one knows if he still has any trump cards.”

Hua Zi sneered and said, “Foster father, isn’t that Qin Yu’s trump card move that Dharma Idol? Other than his body getting bigger, I don’t think it’s anything great.”

“Moreover, you have also taught me the Eternal Dharma Idol. This is a spell that you created yourself. How can Qin Yu be compared to it?”

Yong Ji nodded slightly. He was quite reassured with Hua Zi.

“Foster father, don’t worry. Three days later, I will definitely Behead Qin Yu and give it to you!”Hua Zi patted his chest and said.

The Heavenly Cloud sect also received this news.

After the first elder heard about this matter, he immediately couldn’t stop laughing.

“Hahaha, finally, someone is going to suppress this child!”The first elder stroked his beard and laughed excitedly.

“When two people of the same generation fight, even if it’s Jue Wu, she doesn’t have the right to stop it!”

“First Elder, perhaps we can take the opportunity to secretly get rid of Qin Yu.”The white elder suddenly said.

The first Elder’s eyes narrowed slightly, as if he had a thought.

“Absolutely not.”At this moment, the vice sect master shook his head.

“The invasion of the northern lands is becoming more and more serious. According to sect master’s wishes, we should send people to the northern border.”

At the mention of the northern lands, first elder’s expression became somewhat unnatural.

He snorted coldly and said, “There’s no need. The people of the northern lands are not worth mentioning at all. Moreover, the northern lands are not our heavenly cloud sect’s enemies.”

The deputy sect master frowned slightly and said, “First Elder, this is the sect master’s intention. Could it be that you want to go against the sect master’s wishes?”

First Elder’s expression changed and he berated, “Nonsense! Do I have the final say in this heavenly cloud sect, or do you have the final say?”

The deputy sect master was silent, but the expression on his face was rather subtle.

“I’ve already sent people to the northern border. You Don’t have to worry.”First Elder waved his hand and said.

He accepted the benefits of the black-robed man, of course, he was not willing to attack the people of the north.
