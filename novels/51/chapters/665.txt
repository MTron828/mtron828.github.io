Chapter 666: The Prison Cell Opposite Yan Ruoxue Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The arrogant Geng Si had turned into an ice-cold corpse in the blink of an eye!

He lay on the ground, motionless, his blood staining the rain.

No expression could be seen on Jiang He’s aged face.

The rain flowed down his cheeks. He turned around and walked toward Qin Yu step by step.

“Senior Jiang He...” Qin Yu said these words with difficulty.

Jiang He nodded slightly. He bent down and said faintly, “I’ll take you back.”

“No...” Qin Yu rejected Jiang He’s good intentions.

He gritted his teeth and said, “This is a rare opportunity. I can’t miss it...”

Jiang He frowned slightly and said, “Can you still stand up in your current state?”

Of course, Jiang He knew the side effects of this spell. Once it was cast, it would take at least ten days to half a month to stand up.

However, Qin Yu remained silent. He gritted his teeth and struggled to stand up from the ground.

“Senior Jiang He... Thank you...” Qin Yu said with difficulty.

Jiang He was speechless for a moment.

Looking at Qin Yu, he felt inexplicably ashamed.

If he had fought like Qin Yu did back then, would the ending be different?

“Senior Jiang He, you should leave quickly... you must not let others discover your arrival...” Qin Yu said.

Seeing this, Jiang He didn’t say anything more. He nodded and took a step forward. In the blink of an eye, he disappeared from the street.

After Jiang He left, Qin Yu couldn’t hold on any longer.

He staggered two steps and then fell to the ground with a bang.

“How impressive.” Xia Hang’s voice sounded in Qin Yu’s ear.

Qin Yu raised his head and looked at Xia Hang. He was finally relieved.

“Xia Hang... Please...”

After saying this, Qin Yu fainted.

Xia Hang stood there for a long time and sighed slightly. Then, he reached out his hand to grab Qin Yu and turned around to walk toward the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

In the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

Qu Xie was sitting in his office, waiting for the good news from Geng Si.

“How long has it been since the Jingdu Martial Arts Association sent out a purple robe?” The assistant couldn’t help but sigh.

Qu Xie nodded slightly and said, “Someone like Qin Yu must be killed in the bud. Otherwise, he will become a disaster. Sending out a purple robe is nothing.”

The assistant also nodded. “Yes, no one would have thought that Qin Yu was the black-robed man. His strength is indeed nerve-wracking.”

As he was speaking, the door opened.

Then, Xia Hang, who was drenched in rain, walked in.

He was holding a person in his arms.

This person was none other than Qin Yu.

Xia Hang threw Qin Yu in front of Qu Xie without saying a word.

Qu Xie was stunned.

He hurriedly stood up and bent down to pat Qin Yu’s face.

“Qin... Qin Yu!” Qu Xie was overjoyed! He was beyond excited!

“We finally caught this bastard!”

The assistant at the side asked in confusion, “Vice President Xia, why is Qin Yu in your hands? where is Mr. Geng?”

Xia Hang lit a cigarette and said indifferently, “Geng Si is dead.”

“What?!” Qu Xie Mengran’s eyes widened!

He glared at Xia Hang and said coldly, “You said Geng Si is dead? Who did it?”

Xia Hang pointed at Qin Yu, who was lying on the ground, with his chin and said, “Who else could it be other than him?”

“How is this possible?” Qu Xie exclaimed.

“How could Qin Yu be a match for Geng Si?!”

Xia Hang said coldly, “His body is near my house. You should be able to find it if you go there now.”

As soon as he said that, the phone on Qu Xie’s desk rang.

He picked up the phone and heard someone say, “President Qu, Geng Si is dead. His head was blown off.”

Hearing that, Qu Xie immediately sat down on the ground.

“Qin Yu... has actually grown to such an extent?!” Qu Xie muttered in a low voice, as if he could not believe it.

Xia Hang said coldly, “I already said that we should use the Martial Saint weapon to kill him. Unfortunately, you did not believe me.”

Qu Xie glanced at Xia Hang and then said in puzzlement, “Even Geng Si is not his match. How did you capture him?”

Xia Hang looked at Qu Xie coldly and said, “President Qu, what do you mean? I captured Qin Yu, and not only did you not reward me, but you even blamed him?”

After saying that, Xia Hang stood up angrily and said, “I must report this matter to the higher-ups and ask them to make a decision for me!”

After saying that, Xia Hang turned around and was about to leave.

Qu Xie hurriedly stopped Xia Hang and said with a smile, “Vice President Xia, I absolutely have no such intention. I just think it’s strange.”

Xia Hang snorted coldly. He took a puff of smoke and said, “Qin Yu used a spell to forcefully increase his cultivation, and that’s why he was able to kill Geng Si.”

“And you should know better than me the consequences of using this spell.”

When Qu Xie heard this, he was suddenly enlightened!

He gave Xia Hang a thumbs up and said, “You’ve rendered meritorious service this time. Don’t worry, I’ll definitely ask the higher-ups for meritorious service for you!”

Xia Hang waved his hand and said, “There’s no need. I will tell the higher-ups personally.”

“Good, good!” Qu Xie was in high spirits and seemed to have no time to care about anything else.

He looked coldly at Qin Yuand grinned. “Little bastard, I’ve finally caught you!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“You’ve brought so much trouble to Jingdu Martial Arts Association. I’ll kill you right now!”

Qu Xie’s hands glowed with killing intent.

Xia Hang’s heart jumped!

If Qu Xie killed Qin Yu directly, all his efforts would be in vain!

“President Qu, let’s not kill him yet,” the assistant suddenly said at this moment.

Qu Xie frowned slightly and asked, “Why?”

The assistant smiled bitterly and said, “Have you forgotten? The people who want to capture him now are not only the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. The officials are also trying to capture him.”

“If we kill him now, how are we going to answer to the authorities?”

Hearing this, Qu Xie suddenly understood.

He said with some lingering fear, “We almost caused trouble...”

One had to know that the higher-ups were already dissatisfied with the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. If they were to kill Qin Yu behind their backs, it would probably bring trouble to the entire association.

“Then let him live for a few more days. Once the procedures are completed, get rid of him immediately!” Qu Xie said coldly.

Then, Qu Xie called for someone and dragged Qin Yu into the prison.

“Remember, lock him in front of Yan Ruoxue,” Qu Xie exhorted.

“Yes, President Qu,” the few of them nodded.

Soon, Qin Yu was dragged into the prison.

Seeing this, the people in the prison couldn’t help but discuss in low voices.

“Isn’t this the kid who broke into the prison not long ago?”

“Why was he also caught?”

“Tsk. Going against the Jingdu Martial Arts Association really didn’t end well. What a pity.”
