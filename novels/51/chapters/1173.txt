Chapter 1174: Chapter 1174, the ancient array platform at the bottom of the sea 

Under the observation of the desolate God’s eye, Xiao Yu seemed to be summoning something.

Qin Yu followed Xiao Yu’s location and headed there.

The distance between the two was not too close. Even if Qin Yu was using the ‘walking’character, it would still take some time.

At this moment, Xiao Yu’s hands were flashing with black light. The light turned into chains and from the bottom of the sea, she forcefully pulled out a huge array platform!

This array platform had a dark, ancient light, as if it was made of thousand-year-old black iron.

With a closer look, it was actually an ancient array platform!

At this moment, Xiao Yu stopped what she was doing.

Her eyes looked in Qin Yu’s direction, and she frowned slightly.

“Xiao Yu!”

Qin Yu was like a stream of light, and he quickly arrived in front of Xiao Yu.

The moment she saw Qin Yu, Xiao Yu did not say anything and turned around to leave.

She was extremely fast, and the sea breeze blew her white clothes, making her look like a beautiful scenery.

“Xiao Yu! Stop right there!”Qin Yu could not help but shout, and at the same time, he quickened his pace.

However, Xiao Yu did not pay any attention to Qin Yu. There was a trace of coldness on her body, and she turned around to slap Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s expression changed. He did not dare to be negligent and hurriedly clenched his fist to meet Xiao Yu.

“Clang!”

A huge force exploded on Qin Yu’s fist!

“Deng Deng Deng!”

Under this huge force, Qin Yu was immediately pushed back and his body slid hundreds of meters across the sea!

By the time Qin Yu stabilized his body, Xiao Yu had already disappeared without a trace.

He used the desolate God’s eye and scanned his surroundings, but he still could not find Xiao Yu.

Qin Yu stood on the surface of the sea and couldn’t help but frown.

He couldn’t figure out why Xiao Yu refused to see him.

“That palm...”Qin Yu lowered his head and looked at his fist, only to feel waves of pain.

A casual palm had forced him back hundreds of meters. This was enough to show that Xiao Yu’s current strength was beyond imagination.

After a long time, Qin Yu’s gaze turned to the ancient array platform floating on the surface of the sea.

“This array platform was pulled out from under the sea. Could it be that Xiao Yu wants to use this array platform to head to the Holy Region?”Qin Yu frowned.

He stood on the array platform and released his divine sense.

Unfortunately, on this array platform, Qin Yu couldn’t sense the slightest flow of internal Qi. The entire array platform was extremely ordinary.

Qin Yu didn’t know how to use this array platform at all. Not only Qin Yu, even Yan Yongfu didn’t know anything about it.

“One of the eighteen array platforms is actually hidden under the sea,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He stretched out his palm and left his internal Qi on the array platform before turning around and leaving.

After returning to Cloud Dragon Island, Yan Yongfu couldn’t help but ask, “Where did you go?”

Qin Yu didn’t answer his question. Instead, he asked back, “Do you know the background of that masked woman?”

“Masked Woman?”Yan Yongfu was stunned. Then, he shook his head and said, “I don’t know much about her. The only thing I know is that she single-handedly destroyed the entire immortal slaying sect back then. Moreover, this is only a legend. Whether it’s true or not is unknown.”

Qin Yu rubbed his chin and couldn’t help but fall into deep thought.

Yan Yongfu was a mighty figure. Moreover, he had lived for many years, so he knew all kinds of secret histories and rumors in the world.

Since he didn’t even know about the masked woman, this was enough to prove that most of the legends about the masked woman were probably in the holy region.

Otherwise, that handlebar mustache wouldn’t know so much about her.

“Let’s go.”Qin Yu shook his head, no longer thinking about it.

They left the Cloud Dragon Island. After spending three days, Qin Yu returned to the Divine Alchemist pavilion and found Fang Yue.

Just like Yan Ruoxue, Fang Yue’s entire body was immersed in a medicinal pool to maintain her body’s needs.

Qin Yu brought Yan Yongfu and walked directly to Fang Yue.

He didn’t waste any time and immediately used a secret technique to wake Fang Yue up.

The two panaceas flickered with a dazzling radiance. All the radiance gathered at the center of her brows and then covered her entire body.

The two panaceas left Qin Yu’s hands and entered Fang Yue’s body on their own.

After doing all this, Qin Yu stood to the side and quietly waited for Fang Yue to wake up.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s heart was extremely complicated. The three years of absence had caused Fang Yue to be out of touch with this era.

She was supposed to be the favored daughter of the heavens, competing with all the geniuses, but now she had stopped at the grandmaster level.

In the future, it would be difficult for her to walk the Jianghu alone.

“Qin Yu, come out for a moment.”

At this moment, pavilion master suddenly walked in.

Qin Yu followed pavilion master out of the room.

“Pavilion master, What’s the matter?”Pavilion master asked.

Pavilion master said solemnly, “I just received news that someone from the holy region has already descended through the ancient array platform.”

Qin Yu was immediately shocked when he heard this.

“So Fast? This is a few days earlier than Tian Jizi’s prediction,”Qin Yu said with a frown.

Pavilion master nodded and said, “That’s right. Because of Gu Xinghe’s request, those reclusive powerhouses have already found most of the ancient array platforms.”

“Just now, there was news that there was an anomaly in an ancient array platform. Someone walked out from the array platform.”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, then said in a deep voice, “In that case, it’s not long before they enter the Holy Region.”

“That’s right.”Pavilion master nodded.

“Right now, those two cultivators from the holy region seem to be looking for something. Many of the places they went to were once the resources of the martial arts association of Jingdu.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh. “What? People from the holy region are still coveting our resources?”

“Who knows? Maybe they will discover something different,”pavilion master said.

“Qin Yu, this woman has already woken up.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

As he was speaking, Yan Yongfu’s voice suddenly came from the room.

Hearing this, Qin Yu hurriedly walked into the room.
