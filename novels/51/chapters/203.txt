Chapter 204: I Refuse! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Such powerful strength and ruthless methods instantly caused the atmosphere to turn heavy.

Many people, afraid that they would be implicated, took two steps back.

“You don’t have to go to this extent over such a small matter.” At this moment, a young man said with a smile.

Qin Yu glanced at him and didn’t say anything. He just waved his hand, and a wave of qi energy immediately came pressing over!

Under this burst of energy, the young man seemed to have suffered a heavy blow. With a bang, he knelt on the ground!

“Just now, when Yao Qing was bullied by them, you didn’t say a word. Now, why are you pretending to be a good person? Kneel together!” Qin Yu said coldly.

Everyone was stunned.

No one expected that this young man who had just been locked up would be so powerful!

Those few Inner Strength Past Masters were even more flustered. Which one of them wasn’t a big shot in the outside world? Which one of them wasn’t sought after by everyone?

But now, their legs were broken by Qin Yu and they were kneeling on the ground!

At this moment, they were a little afraid!

“Sir, I. . . we know that we were wrong. Please be magnanimous...” someone said in a low voice.

Qin Yu glanced at him and sneered. “Kneel down. Don’t stand up for an hour.”

After saying that, Qin Yu pulled Yao Qing to the side.

“Mr. Qin, your strength... has reached such a level?!” Yao Qing’s eyes lit up and said excitedly.

Qin Yu ignored his remark and frowned. “Why are you here?”

Yao Qing couldn’t help but sigh when he mentioned this topic.

Then, Yao Qing told him the whole story.

After the conversation, Yao Qing found out that Yao Qing had a sister who was studying in the provincial capital.

When he worked for the Shen family, he had arranged for his sister to be in the provincial capital.

Now that he worked for Qin Yu, he wanted to bring his sister to Jiangcheng so that he could take care of her.

“But I never thought that I would offend someone in the provincial capital. That person is a relative of a member of the Martial Arts Association,” Yao Qing said with a bitter smile.

“I quarreled with him a little, and then I was locked up for three years.”

When he heard this, Qin Yu’s expression suddenly became even colder.

This also made Qin Yu’s impression of the Martial Arts Association a little worse.

“This Martial Arts Association is really unreasonable,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Yao Qing sighed and said, “What can we do about it?”

Qin Yu couldn’t figure out why such an unfair organization existed and what qualifications it had to manage all the martial artists in the world.

Most importantly, no martial artist in the world had ever thought of rebelling. Instead, they viewed them as authority.

It was truly laughable.

“Mr. Qin, why are you here?” Yao Qing asked in puzzlement.

Upon the mention of this topic, Qin Yu couldn’t help but fall into silence.

He didn’t know if he would have a chance to leave after coming in this time. He might even die here.

Thinking of this, he couldn’t help but laugh bitterly.

“Mr. Qin, what’s wrong?” Yao Qing asked.

Qin Yu shook his head and smiled. “Nothing.”

“By the way, didn’t I promise to teach you breathing exercises?” At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly remembered something.

Yao Qing nodded and said, “Yes, I thought you had forgotten about it.”

“Sigh, there were too many things on my mind. I had indeed forgotten about it,” Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

“While there is still time, I will teach you the breathing exercise,” Qin Yu said in a sullen voice.

Yao Qing had followed Qin Yu for a long time without any complaints.

And Qin Yu had nothing to give him. This breathing exercise might be the best gift.

Yao Qing hurriedly nodded and said, “Okay!”

Thus, the two of them walked to the side, and Qin Yu began to teach him the breathing exercise.

Yao Qing was talented, but he didn’t have the resources of a big family.

Under Qin Yu’s teaching, Yao Qing only spent an hour before comprehending this breathing exercise.

“Mr. Qin, I feel that this is different from the Inner Strength that I cultivate,” Yao Qing said with some surprise.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “This is much stronger than Inner Strength. Remember this method and cultivate slowly in the future. Sooner or later, your strength will surpass your imagination.”

Yao Qing, not daring to say anything more, nodded repeatedly.

“Qin Yu!”

At this moment, a shout suddenly came from outside.

After turning around, he saw Yuan Hong standing at the door.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and immediately walked toward the prison door.

“What? Do you need me for something?” Qin Yu asked coldly.

Yuan Hong sized up Qin Yu and then said indifferently, “You’d better put away your defiant attitude. I don’t like it very much.”

“What does you not liking it have to do with me?” Qin Yu sneered.

Yuan Hong wasn’t angry. He snorted lightly and said, “I’ve seen many arrogant and unruly young people like you, but unfortunately, they were all tamed in the end and became ordinary people.”

“Qin Yu, do you think you will be like them?” Yuan Hong raised his eyebrows and asked.

Qin Yu said impatiently, “If you have something to say, you’d better say it quickly. I don’t want to listen to your whining here.”

When he heard this, anger finally flashed across Yuan Hong’s face.

He took a deep breath and suppressed the anger in his heart. He said coldly, “I came to find you with the intention of giving you a chance.”

“Oh really?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows. He couldn’t help but find it funny.

Give him a chance? With the M.O. of the Jiang family, would they give anyone a chance?

Yuan Hong continued, “I heard that you are a pharmacist. Our Martial Arts Association values talents, so we decided to give you a chance.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything and signaled Yuan Hong to continue.

“As long as you are willing to cure Jiang Haoran, we can let you go and let you leave this place. How about it?” Yuan Hong said with a smile.

Surprise flashed across Qin Yu’s face. He said in surprise, “Is what you said true?”

“Of course,” Yuan Hong said with a smile.

“Qin Yu, this is a good opportunity for you. Don’t miss it,” Yuan Hong said patiently.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He stroked his chin, as if he was thinking.

“Think about it carefully. There aren’t many opportunities. After all, you aren’t the only pharmacist in the world.” Yuan Hong saw that Qin Yu seemed to be persuaded, and surprise flashed across his face.

“There’s no need to think about it anymore. Come with me,” Yuan Hong urged.

However, at this moment, Qin Yu shook his head and said with a sneer. “Sorry, I refuse.”

When he heard this, Yuan Hong’s expression immediately changed.

“You refuse?” Yuan Hong’s expression turned cold.

“Qin Yu, you have to think carefully. This is the only chance for you to survive!”

“There are many pharmacists in the world, and there are countless people who can cure Jiang Haoran!”

“If we didn’t cherish talents, you wouldn’t have gotten this chance!”

Qin Yu looked at Yuan Hong and sneered. “President Yuan, I’ve been a fool for the past thirty years, so I don’t like people lying to me.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“If pharmacists are so easy to hire, why would the Jiang family come to me?”

“Moreover... even if I really cured Jiang Haoran, with the Jiang family’s moral character, they wouldn’t let me go, right?”

These words made Yuan Hong’s expression suddenly change!
