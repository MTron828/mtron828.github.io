Chapter 1650: In chapter 1,650, the godly monarch was defeated! 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

This palm headed straight for Qin Yu!

But at that moment, Qin Yu revealed a cold smile on his face.

He made a move that surprised the godly monarch. Qin Yu crossed his arms across his chest and looked coldly at the palm!

“He actually gave up resisting!”Someone exclaimed!

The crystal clear palm came straight at Qin Yu. In the blink of an eye, it slammed fiercely on Qin Yu’s body.

“Dang!”

A huge sound exploded at this moment. The powerful force was like a cannonball that reverberated in Qin Yu’s chest!

The impact force forced Qin Yu back a few steps. What was shocking was that there was not a single wound on Qin Yu’s body. Not even a white mark was left!

“How is this possible!”

The godly monarch suddenly opened his eyes!

He simply could not believe that Qin Yu’s body was actually able to withstand the white tiger’s power from the four symbols technique!

Just how powerful was this child’s body?

“Just this little bit of power?”Qin Yu sneered.

The godly monarch narrowed his eyes. He once again activated his spell, and that palm slapped over once again!

This time, Qin Yu clenched his fist and a golden radiance surged out!

His fist seemed to draw a parabola in the air as it ruthlessly smashed towards the power of the White Tiger! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Boom!”

Qin Yu’s crushing power seemed to sweep through everything!

The Golden Radiance was instantly revealed. The terrifying power directly pierced through that white palm. Even the huge immortal palace hanging above the godly monarch’s head began to tremble violently at this moment!

“Pu!”

The godly monarch seemed to be affected by this power. He spat out a mouthful of blood!

The Immortal Palace above his head started to shake as if it was about to collapse!

Qin Yu looked at the godly monarch coldly and said, “So you will be injured as well.”

With that, the Golden Light on Qin Yu’s body appeared again. A powerful power surged rapidly on his body!

Even though they were very far away, they were still shocked by this powerful Suppressive Force. Some people even knelt down!

Even though he was a godly monarch of the northern lands, he felt as though his chest was being pressed down at this moment. It was difficult for him to even breathe!

He did not dare to be negligent. With a thought, he produced a black lotus flower!

This was his final spell. It had been contaminated with the powers of the northern lands. It was extremely powerful!

Even when he had faced Xiao Sheng’s clone back then, he had been extremely confident!

The lotus flower pounced towards Qin Yu, and a terrifying pressure swiftly spread out.

An extremely strange power was emitted from the lotus flower. At a glance, one could even see that the space was continuously distorting.

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold. He raised his golden palm and directly grabbed towards the Black Lotus!

The two large hands were like huge golden fans that blotted out the sky and covered the earth!

The Black Lotus was covered by Qin Yu’s hands and was held in his palm!

“Boom!”

A muffled sound exploded in Qin Yu’s palm!

The terrifying power caused Qin Yu to continuously tremble, as if he was about to lose his grip!

“Ah! ! !”

Right at this moment, Qin Yu raised his head and let out an angry roar. He exerted his strength to the extreme, and every vein on his body bulged!

He closed his palms tightly, and his strength grew stronger. Under everyone’s watchful eyes, he actually forcefully grasped the power of this black lotus in his palm!

At this moment, the godly monarch already felt a sense of horror, and he secretly felt that things were not looking good.

He had used all his trump cards, but Qin Yu still looked extremely relaxed.

“This Immortal Palace of yours, I will behead it today.”At this moment, Qin Yu’s voice entered his ears.

He raised his palm, and endless golden light surged up from his arm!

What was even more shocking was that numerous golden threads also entered!

This was enough to show that Qin Yu’s understanding of the Great Dao was extremely thorough, and he could even borrow the power of the Great Dao!

In the blink of an eye, a huge golden sword hung above Qin Yu’s head.

Spiritual Energy Sword’s Qi ran through the rainbow, creating magnificent waves. Its momentum was extremely impressive. It was as if this world was about to sink and float beneath it!

Qin Yu dragged the huge sword with one hand and looked coldly at the godly monarch.

“Great Dao has form, Great Dao is formless. All spells arise from one’s heart,”Qin Yu said coldly.

This huge sword was the embodiment of Qin Yu’s battle intent! It was an incomparable boldness and determination!

The godly monarch’s expression turned even uglier. He hurriedly urged the immortal palace, and all the Divine Beasts soared into the sky!

Qin Yu sneered incessantly. He held the huge sword with one hand and gently pressed it in the direction of the Immortal Palace.

“Boom!”

The huge sword instantly crushed towards the immortal palace!

Above the immortal palace, there were several beams of light of different colors. They were extremely mysterious, as though they were resisting the huge sword in Qin Yu’s hand!

The godly monarch did not dare to be distracted at all. He expended all his energy and energy at this moment.

But in the end, he still failed.

Under the huge sword’s powerful battle power, the immortal palace began to collapse. The light dissipated at this moment and once again entered his body.

In the blink of an eye, the immortal palace phenomenon hanging above his head disappeared.

“Pu!”

The godly monarch suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood. At that moment, his expression became extremely defeated, and his internal Qi was extremely weak!

He had lost! Everyone understood that Qin Yu had won this battle, and it was an extremely easy victory!

“Don’t be anxious. I will send you on your way right now.”Qin Yu’s tone was extremely cold, causing everyone to tremble.

And that resolute and extremely murderous gaze made the godly monarch extremely terrified!

He gritted his teeth and shouted, “Qin Yu, don’t be too complacent. The Lord will definitely kill you!”

After saying this, he did not dare to waste any more time. He quickly activated the Northern Land’s formation and entered the darkness!

“Where do you think you’re going! ?”

Qin Yu roared as his golden fist came sweeping over like a mountain range!

In an instant, that space completely collapsed!

The power of this punch was something that even space could not withstand, revealing a large area of darkness!

Unfortunately, although this punch had shattered the void, it was still a step too slow and could not shake him out of the formation.

The Void was slowly healing, and the godly monarch had already disappeared without a trace.

Qin Yu looked at the darkness that was slowly healing, and his expression was terrifyingly gloomy.

“As expected, it’s still very difficult to kill him. Otherwise, senior Xiao Hai would have killed them long ago,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He sighed slightly, and his heart could not help but be filled with worry.

Could it be that they really had to step into the northern lands before they could be completely exterminated?

Just as Qin Yu was deep in thought, thunderous cheers and applause came from the surroundings!

“Finally, someone can finally defeat them! Qin Yu, you are our hero!”

“You saved Ying Ning City! You saved the South Province!”

Countless people rushed over like a tide and surrounded Qin Yu.

Each of their faces was filled with excitement. Only Qin Yu was not as optimistic as them.
