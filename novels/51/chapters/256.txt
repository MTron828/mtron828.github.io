Yang Jing, afraid to touch the jade pendant, was so scared that she quickly dodged to the side.

With a flick of Qin Yu’s finger, the jade pendant instantly shattered.

“Don’t worry, I will compensate you with a protective jade pendant,” Qin Yu said.

No matter what, this jade pendant had brought Qin Yu some benefits.

It was indeed inappropriate not to compensate her.

Yang Jing quickly said, “Qin Yu, thank you. You helped me once again...”

At this point, Qin Yu suddenly remembered about Xiao Yu.

“By the way, I heard that you are going to hold a concert in the provincial capital soon?” Qin Yu asked.

At the mention of this topic, Yang Jing was suddenly invigorated.

She said with some pride, “What? You also know? I thought you didn’t obsess over celebrities!”

Qin Yu glanced at her and said, “My friend asked for your concert tickets.”

“Your friend wants them?” Yang Jing was a little disappointed.

“If you want them, I have no problem with it. As for your friend, forget it,” Yang Jing said deliberately.

“Ok, forget it then.” Qin Yu stood up and turned around to go back to his room.

Yang Jing was so angry that she stomped her feet. She glared at Qin Yu and said, “Why don’t you know how to be humorous? Do you treat all girls like this?”

“More or less. There’s only one exception,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

The exception was naturally Yan Ruoxue.

In front of Yan Ruoxue, Qin Yu always acted like a child.

Perhaps this was the feeling of being pampered.

“Forget it.” Yang Jing felt dejected.

“When your friend goes, tell me. I’ll take her to the VIP channel.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Thank you then. I’ll treat it as me owing you a favor.”

“Pfft, you’ve helped me so many times. This little favor is nothing,” said Yang Jing.

Qin Yu smiled and didn’t say anything.

Yang Jing didn’t stay here any longer and quickly disappeared into the night.

The next morning, Qin Yu ran around the area a few times. It had to be said that the morning air was indeed refreshing.

When he went back, it was only eight o’clock in the morning. However, just as Qin Yu reached the door of his house, he saw Xiao Yu waiting there.

“Did you get the tickets?” Upon seeing Qin Yu, Xiao Yu ran up excitedly.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Huh?” Xiao Yu immediately became anxious.

“There’s only one day left until the concert! I’ve already bragged to my classmates. If you don’t get the tickets, how will I face them?” Xiao Yu pouted and said.

Qin Yu rolled his eyes. “Why do you always act like this at such a young age? Don’t worry. Although I didn’t get the tickets, I can take you through the VIP channel.”

“Really?” Xiao Yu was immediately happy again.

She even jumped up and tried to kiss Qin Yu on the face.

Unfortunately, Qin Yu dodged it.

“Okay, if there’s nothing else, hurry home. Don’t waste my time,” Qin Yu said.

“Then don’t forget about it tomorrow...” Xiao Yu muttered.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. After he went back, Yao Qing walked over with his phone.

“Mr. Qin.” Yao Qing frowned slightly, and his expression didn’t look too good.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “What’s wrong?”

Yao Qing took a deep breath and said, “Gu Taichu has spread the word.”

“Oh really?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and became interested.

Yao Qing said, “Gu Taichu said that he will only give you three days to go to the Gu family to die. If you don’t go, he will come to Chuzhou personally.”

Qin Yu sneered. “Gu Taichu is really arrogant. He wants me to die?”

Yao Qing frowned and said, “Mr. Qin, Gu Taichu isn’t as simple as he seems. His strength is far above Jiang Gu’s and the others’.”

“Rumor has it that three years ago, he was already a fifth level Inner Strength Grandmaster. Now, his strength is even more astonishing!”

“There is even a rumor that he ranks in the top five in the Jiang Bei Region!”

Qin Yu touched his chin and muttered, “So he isn’t number one... then what is there for him to be arrogant about?”

Yao Qing was instantly speechless.

He sighed and said, “Mr. Qin, you should hurry up and think of a way.”

“I have to think of a way,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

The strength that the ancestor of the Earth Fiend Valley had lent him couldn’t last until then.

With Qin Yu’s current strength, it would be very difficult for him to defeat Gu Taichu.

“It seems that I have to set up a formation in advance,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Another day passed.

Qin Yu spent these two days quite leisurely. Although he was famous, no one came to provoke him, and no one wanted to become his disciple.

Perhaps because of Gu Taichu, everyone was waiting.

In the afternoon, Xiao Yu called Qin Yu.

She said anxiously, “Why aren’t you here yet? Did you forget?”

Qin Yu scratched his head.

He really forgot about this matter.

“I’ll go now,” Qin Yu said.

The venue of Yang Jing’s concert was the provincial capital’s stadium.

Qin Yu sped all the way and soon arrived at the venue.

What surprised Qin Yu was that the place was packed with people. They even mobilized relevant personnel to maintain order.

The entire street was filled with people. Some people were hawking their wares, while others were waiting.

“Celebrities are actually so popular?” Qin Yu didn’t expect this.

With no other choice, Qin Yu could only call Xiao Yu.

After parking the car, Xiao Yu ran over in a hurry.

Beside her was a little girl of the same age as her.

The little girl was dressed quite decently, and there was a small tattoo on her collarbone. It was obvious that she was a rebellious girl.

“Xiao Yu, is this the guy you were talking about? He doesn’t look impressive. How can he drive a shabby Audi?” The girl sized up Qin Yu and said.

Xiao Yu was speechless and said, “Do you know what an RS7 is? This is a performance car.”

“A performance car is still a lousy Audi. My friends all drive Porsches!” The girl said proudly.

Xiao Yu was too lazy to argue with her. She pulled Qin Yu and said, “How is it? When can you take us in?”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “I’ll give Yang Jing a call.”

“Give Yang Jing a call? Wow, you’re so good at bragging. How can Yang Jing like you?” The girl rolled her eyes.

Even Xiao Yu found it unbelievable.

“Qin Yu, your bragging seems a little unrealistic,” Xiao Yu muttered.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Just wait and see.”

At this moment, two young men walked over from not far away.

“Xiao Mi, are you here to watch the concert?” The young man asked.

The girl called Xiao Mi quickly said, “Yang Zhao? Why are you here? Did you get the tickets?”

Yang Zhao said indifferently, “With my connections, it’s no problem to get a few tickets.”

“Wow, Yang Zhao, you’re so awesome!” Xiao Mi immediately said excitedly.

After saying that, she looked at Xiao Yu with disdain and said, “Look at Yang Zhao, and then look at your friend.”

“It’s okay if you don’t have a ticket, but to say that you know Yang Jing is hilarious.”

“Know Yang Jing? Hehe, as far as I know, Yang Jing doesn’t seem to have any friends in Chuzhou,” Yang Zhao said nonchalantly.

After saying that, he glanced at Qin Yu and said with a frown, “It’s you?!”
