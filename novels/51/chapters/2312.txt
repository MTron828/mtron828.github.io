2313 The Heavenly Might

Qin Yu instantly woke up. His divine sense became a hundred times clearer. Yan Ruoxue came over and murmured.

“Ah! Ah! Ah!”

Qin Yu, on the ground, suddenly let out a miserable howl so intense that his vocal cords could not withstand it and snapped instantly.

He let out a hoarse roar. His throat shattered, and numerous streams of blood gushed out from his throat.

His body began to convulse violently, and the violent convulsions even broke his bones.

This kind of pain was beyond what a human could endure. Under the control of Nightmare, Qin Yu’s soul could feel this pain a hundred times more but would not faint.

“Why don’t we kill him?”

Gu Baiyi’s eyes were red. She turned her head and dared not look at Qin Yu’s miserable state.

The hands of the remaining two were also trembling.

At this moment, countless cracks appeared on the two divine sense figurines in Qin Yu’s divine sense. The outermost layer of the golden and black figurines’ origin of the divine sense began to shatter.

The origin of the divine sense represented the root of a person’s divine sense. If the origin of the divine sense collapsed, the person would become an idiot.

“I’m begging you, quickly stop the Soul Torment Mind Technique! Quickly stop!”

The black divine sense figurine screamed in madness, crying and sobbing uncontrollably.

Not only did the golden figurine feel the tremendous pain, but also the black figurine.

Under the tremendous pain, the two figurines shattered at a terrifying speed. The black divine sense figurine turned into a pool of black water in tens of breaths. At the last moment, he let out a scream of relief.

When the last layer of the outer shell of the golden divine sense shattered, and it revealed its core, the golden core…

A beam of golden light suddenly erupted, and the dazzling and radiant golden light instantly enveloped Qin Yu. The golden light wrapped around Qin Yu’s golden core like a layer of clothes. It was like a father putting clothes on his child, forcefully retaining his most important power of the origin.

A soft sigh sounded from Qin Yu’s divine sense, which contained boundless pity.

“Father.”

A teardrop flowed out of Qin Yu’s eyes.

He was like a father who loved his child deeply, hoping his son could live happily. He only wanted his child to live a happy life and did not want Qin Yu to walk the same path of cultivation as him.

“Father, I don’t regret it! With you behind me, what am I afraid of!”

Qin Yu laughed maniacally.

The Soul Torment Mind Technique! Ultimate!

The terrifying suction force erupted again, and the souls crushed each other again.

Qin Yu’s soul power was almost like a solid body at this moment.

The bones in his body were all broken, and his entire body collapsed on the ground like mud.

His body was comparable to a demonic beast, but his bones were broken in such a painful convulsion. One could imagine how painful it was!

Under the control of his origin, the two divine sense figurines took shape again.

Again, the terrifying soul power was compressed forcefully into his soul, and Qin Yu’s divine sense collapsed again.

“Hahaha, again. I’m not afraid of you! Soul Soul Torment Mind Technique!”

He collapsed repeatedly and was reborn repeatedly.

His father protected the last trace of his origin, and the stimulation of “Yan Ruoxue” became the core motivation for Qin Yu.

Even the Illusionary Night Bloody Pupil in the void revealed a puzzled expression. It was as if wondering why the person in front did not collapse and die.

Even a Tribulation Transcending top-notch cultivator would have died by now.

It was truly puzzled as to why this cultivator of the fourth grade was still holding on at this moment.

Qin Yu’s world was pitch black. At this moment, he was completely relying on the will deep down to hold on forcefully.

Toward the end, the black Qin Yu no longer had the strength to beg for mercy. He only hoped that he would die as soon as possible and that the clothes of origin could no longer protect him.

“Drip!”

Under extreme compression, in Qin Yu’s Sea of Soul, countless violent powers of the soul were compressed. At the core, a drop of water brighter than the sun gradually formed.

And then it slowly dripped into his sea of divine sense.

“Boom!”

Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness suddenly lit up. At that moment, he seemed to have seen the smiles of his father and Ruoxue.

Within the body of Qin Yu, a golden light that was a hundred times brighter than the sun struck Nightmare in the void.

“Ah!”

Nightmare in the void let out a shrill cry, its face revealing an extremely shocked expression.

After much hesitation, it actually turned around and fled.

As Nightmare left, the path it took for nearly a hundred meters instantly shattered.

The original appearance was revealed.

This was Nightmare’s innate ability, the Illusionary Space. Only top-level cultivators of Tribulation Transcending could barely see through this illusion.

“He actually made Nightmare flee in fear? What’s going on?”

Jiang Qingyuan tightly pinched Yan Minglong’s thigh, his eyes dull.

Even they would find it difficult to escape if they encountered Nightmare. How did this fourth-grade True Saint hold on to the end?

“F*ck, he’s indeed a genius! I wonder what it would be if Immortal Emperor Tianming were to compare to this kid when he was young.” Yan Minglong also had not recovered from the shock.

Gu Baiyi did not say anything, but her eyes were shining brightly.

Qin Yu’s physical body was constantly recovering speedily.

As for the advanced stage of body tempering, it would take some time to recover.

However, his soul was tremendously weak, although his divine sense had reached the peak of his cultivation journey.

But this was also the time when he was the most tired. As soon as Nightmare Lord, he almost fainted instantly.

Xi Menn walked over slowly, stuck the sword in his hand into the ground, and then slowly sat beside him.

After dozens of days, Qin Yu slowly woke up.

As soon as he woke up, excruciating pain tearing his soul apart instantly spread throughout his entire brain, almost making him faint again.

After a long time, Qin Yu slowly adapted to the pain.

To his shock, he discovered that his divine sense could now penetrate nearly 300 meters in the ninth level of purgatory.

When he first came in, his divine sense could only see a few meters away.

In his sea of divine sense, a golden drop of water of divine sense was in the middle of the Sea of Soul.

The drop of divine sense water emitted a dazzling light, and a vast amount of divine sense power was condensed inside.

It emerged when the Soul Torment Mind Technique circulated to the extreme.

With a thought, he used the Spiritualization Technique, and the power of divine sense flushed out like a tide. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com
