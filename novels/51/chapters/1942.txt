1943 The Prince of Great Xia

“You! Sharp-tongued and shameless man!” Si Shiyue said coldly. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

At this moment, Qin Yu no longer cared about Si Shiyue and looked at Si Shifeng instead.

The cheeky smile on his face just now had disappeared and was replaced by an unspeakable coldness.

“Si Shifeng, this is your choice,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Si Shifeng’s brows twitched, and he sneered and said, “You seem to be very hostile to me… Is it because of your friend called Chang Mang?”

“Don’t worry. Chang Mang won’t die.” Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “But I’ll make you pay with your life for what he has suffered.”

“That depends on whether you have the ability to do so.” Si Shifeng didn’t take him seriously at all.

As the heir of the Si family, he naturally had a strong sense of pride. But his pride was very different from Si Shiyue and Si Shiyu.

Si Shiyue and Si Shiyu were the true heirs of the Si family, and their bloodlines were the most powerful.

As for Si Shifeng, he was considered an outsider. Regardless of bloodline or status, he was inferior to the other two.

“Speaking of which, you’re indeed far inferior to Si Shiyue and Si Shiyu,” Qin Yu said sarcastically.

“If I’m not wrong, in front of Si Shiyue, you’re no different from a servant, are you?”

Si Shifeng’s expression instantly turned extremely ugly. There was no other reason than Qin Yu’s words that had undoubtedly hurt him.

“Didn’t your mother tell you who your father is?” Qin Yu sneered.

Si Shifeng’s expression instantly turned extremely ugly. There was no other reason than the fact that Qin Yu’s words had undoubtedly hurt him.

Just as Qin Yu had said, Si Shifeng’s background had always been a mystery. Many people believed that he wasn’t really a member of the Si family, as his mother had brought him back from outside.

Now that Qin Yu had said it right, he was naturally extremely angry, and instantly lost his mind!

“I want you to die!” Si Shifeng’s palm trembled, and he directly took out a spear and ruthlessly stabbed it at Qin Yu!

Thousands of rays of light gathered on the tip of the spear. In an instant, hundreds of spears were thrust out, creating huge holes in the void!

Qin Yu quickly dodged, but the spearhead was too fast.

The Golden Light condensed on Qin Yu’s palm, then received the spearhead!

A terrifying force instantly swept out in all directions from the collision between the two!

The people around them quickly retreated. Some of the more powerful ones stood still and watched coldly.

“He’s taken action! He’s really taken action!”

“This Qin Yu is really bold to humiliate Si Shifeng like this!”

“No matter what, Si Shifeng is a member of the Si family. How can he be humiliated like this?!”

Just as the battle was about to start, a peaceful light suddenly spread out, blocking the space between the two.

“Eh?” Si Shiyue’s brows furrowed slightly as he looked into the distance.

Soon, they saw a delicate but extremely weak young man walking over slowly with the help of two maidservants.

He was wearing a long golden robe as though to indicate his extraordinary identity.

“The Prince of Great Xia!”

Someone recognized his identity and instantly exclaimed!

Some inheritors of the older faction immediately knelt and worshipped him.

“Cough! Cough…”

The Prince of Great Xia walked over slowly with the help of the two.

He looked rather weak and coughed from time to time.

After seeing the Prince of Great Xia, Si Shifeng calmed down.

He stood next to Si Shiyue and coldly looked in Qin Yu’s direction.

Soon, the Prince of Great Xia walked up to them.

“Greetings, Prince,” Si Shiyue greeted.

Although his words were polite, he didn’t move his body at all. It was obvious he didn’t take the Prince of Great Xia seriously.

The Prince of Great Xia waved his hand and said, “Holy Son, you don’t have to be so humble. Cough! Cough…”

Si Shiyue didn’t say anything, and no emotion could be seen in his eyes.

“Prince, this brat has humiliated me. Please teach this brat a good lesson using the law of Sky City,” Si Shifeng said.

“What?” Qin Yu ridiculed him. “Are you afraid you’re not my match, so you want to kill me using the strength of another?”

“You’re courting death! Qin Yu, don’t go too far!” Si Shifeng was furious and intended to attack.

Qin Yu said coldly, “You still want to attack me in front of the Prince of Great Xia. Are you looking down on the laws of Sky City? Or are you looking down on the Great Xia Royal Family?”

Si Shifeng opened his mouth but was lost for words suddenly.

Although he might not think highly of the Prince of Great Xia, he still had to show his respect in front of so many people.

“Alright! Alright!” The Prince of Great Xia waved his hand. “Today is the once-in-a-century temple fair. For my sake, no matter what deep hatred you have, can you let it go?”

The Prince of Great Xia coughed again.

Si Shifeng snorted and pointed at Qin Yu, saying, “Three days later, I’ll be waiting for you outside Sky City!”

“For the sake of the Prince of Great Xia, I’ll let you off for now and let you live for a few more days,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

Knowing that he couldn’t outspeak Qin Yu, Si Shifeng didn’t say anything else and turned around to leave.

...

After the Si family left, Qin Yu bowed slightly to the Prince of Great Xia and said, “I’m really sorry.”

The Prince of Great Xia waved his hand and said weakly, “Are you Qin Yu?”

“Your Highness has heard of me?” Qin Yu asked in surprise.

“I’ve heard a little about it. When you defeated Si Shiyu in Thunder Courtyard, our Great Xia also sent people over…” the Prince of Great Xia said slowly.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but be surprised.

Many people went there that day, but Qin Yu knew nothing about the people of Great Xia.

The Prince of Great Xia seemed to notice Qin Yu’s surprise and said self-deprecatingly, “Right now, the Great Xia Royal Family is nothing but an empty shell. It’s just a form of address. Naturally, it won’t be valued.”

“I definitely didn’t mean it that way,” Qin Yu quickly said.

The Prince of Great Xia laughed and said, “It’s fine. It’s fine. However, I’ll have to trouble Mr. Qin to stop making any more moves in Sky City.”

“Definitely.” Qin Yu quickly agreed.

The Prince of Great Xia didn’t say anything else. He left slowly with the help of his two maidservants.

...

Looking at the back of the Prince of Great Xia, the surrounding people couldn’t help but sigh.

“Tsk! Tsk! What a powerful family they were back then but they’ve fallen to such a state today.”

“Yeah! I don’t think the Si family will care about him. Sigh!”

“All the glorious families will fall one day.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything, but he had a feeling this Prince of Great Xia was not as simple as he looked.

Of course, he didn’t think too much about this. After all, it had nothing to do with him.

“Fortunately, the one who attacked was Si Shifeng,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Qin Yu wasn’t too worried about facing Si Shifeng. After all, although he was also the heir of the Si family, he was far too inferior to Si Shiyue.
