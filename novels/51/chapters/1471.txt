Chapter 1472: Chapter 1,472, the Mo family surrenders

Qu Zhu laughed and said, “You make it sound like you’re different.”

“I’m not like you. I’m so busy every day.”

“Busy drinking?”

“...”

The few of them sat in the bamboo forest in the mountains, feeling rather happy.

But at this moment, Qin Yu’s heart was full of worries.

At night.

Qin Yu was fumbling around with a jade pendant hanging around his neck.

This jade pendant was the token that Yan Ruoxue had given him.

“What are you thinking about?”At this moment, qu Zhu suddenly walked over and sat beside Qin Yu.

Qin Yu looked at Qu Zhu and said, “Senior qu Zhu, how long do you think the conflict between the northern lands and the southern region will erupt?”

Qu Zhu Thought for a moment and shook his head. “It’s hard to say, but since the northern lands have already arrived at the southern region, it means that they have already begun to make their move.”

Speaking up to this point, qu Zhu asked in return, “If the people of the northern lands really came to the southern region, what would you choose? Would you leave or choose to stay in the Southern Region?”

Qin Yu was conflicted about this matter.

He didn’t have much feelings for the southern province, so there was no need for him to make a move.

Moreover, Qin Yu and the Heavenly Cloud sect still had this deep hatred.

But if he left, how would it be different from those people at the banquet yesterday? Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“If the spells cultivated by the northern lands are really harmful, I might stay,”Qin Yu said after hesitating for a long time.

Qu Zhu laughed out loud. He patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “Don’t think too much.”

Qin Yu nodded and continued, “To be honest, what I want to do most now is to kill the first Elder.”

“He might have the same idea,”qu Zhu said.

“Yes.”Qin Yu sighed.

The hatred between the two had long been irreconcilable.

If someone took the opportunity to make things difficult for the Heavenly Cloud sect, Qin Yu might very well help out and get rid of the sect together.

As for other matters, Qin Yu didn’t want to think too much about them.

“It’s time to enter closed-door cultivation,”Qin Yu said as he stood up.

“At the very least, you have to step into the mighty realm.”

In this era, those below the mighty realm were truly like ants.

The millions of cultivators in the northern lands were probably existences above the mighty realm.

If this force were to cause trouble, the southern province might really not be able to withstand it.

Even the Heavenly Cloud sect, which was known as the number one sect in the southern province, only had a few tens of thousands of people, and among them, there were even those at the nascent soul stage.

Qin Yu planned to first go and salvage a portion of the herbs, refine enough medicinal pills, and then go into closed-door cultivation.

When he came out of seclusion, it would be the time for the first elder to die.

...

Tianyun sect.

The first elder, who had been taught a lesson by the sect master, appeared a little uneasy.

“Looks like we have to put aside our grudges with Qin Yu for the time being,”the first elder said in a low voice.

At this moment, someone suddenly reported from outside, “First Elder, someone wants to see you.”

“Who is it?”The first elder asked casually.

“It’s the clan leader of the Mo clan, Mo Hong.”

First Elder frowned slightly.

Mo Hong? Why would he come here?

Back then, the Heavenly Cloud sect had sent an invitation to them, but Mo Hong had rejected it.

If it wasn’t for the fact that the sect leader no longer had the intention to kill, Mo Hong would have become a skeleton long ago.

First Elder thought for a moment and said, “Let him come over.”

“Yes, First Elder.”

A few minutes later.

Mo Hong walked in from outside the door.

“Greetings, First Elder.”Mo Hong cupped his hands toward first elder.

First Elder glanced at him and said indifferently, “Mo Hong, what are you doing here?”

Mo Hong did not waste any time and said directly, “I’m here for Qin Yu.”

“Qin Yu?”First Elder’s pupils constricted.

At the mention of Qin Yu, he felt extremely uncomfortable.

“That’s right. I heard that there is hatred between Qin Yu and the Heavenly Cloud sect, so I specially came here,”Mo Hong said.

First Elder snorted lightly and said, “Sect master said to put these matters aside temporarily and let me take a long-term view.”

Mo Hong’s expression changed and he hurriedly said, “First elder, what do you mean? Do you intend to let Qin Yu Go?”

“Of course I don’t want to let him off!”First Elder suppressed his anger and said, “But there are more important things to do at the moment.”

Mo Hong gritted his teeth and said, “First Elder, this Qin Yu killed Ling Yun and humiliated the Tianyun sect many times. Are you going to tolerate this?”

“Mo Hong, what do you mean? What does the matter between the Tianyun sect and Qin Yu have to do with you?”First Elder said with a dark expression.

Mo Hong did not hide it. He gritted his teeth and said, “Qin Yu killed my two sons, and they were the most outstanding sons. I must make him pay the price!”

“Oh, what does this have to do with me?”First Elder said indifferently.

Mo Hong gritted his teeth and said, “First Elder, if you are willing to take action, my Mo family will immediately submit to the Tianyun sect!”

First Elder’s brows twitched as if he was tempted.

Before first elder could say anything, Mo Hong continued, “Of course, if you refuse, I will look for someone else. I believe that the Tianyun sect is not the only one in the world who can kill Qin Yu!”

First Elder fell into silence.

The Mo clan’s assets were quite attractive. Most importantly, the Mo clan was not a new clan, but rather an ancient clan.

Such a family’s heritage, not to be underestimated.
