Chapter 924: Chapter 924, resurrection of the corpse 

“Hey, look at what you’re saying. I’m here to take it, not to steal it!”The mustached man muttered.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Don’t talk nonsense. Won’t your spatial formation be discovered? Isn’t this too conspicuous?”

The mustached man smiled and said, “You don’t understand, do you? I’ve already said it. This is my latest research. It’s obviously different from ordinary spatial formation.”

“After I finish setting it up, I will naturally set up a secret technique to conceal the Great Dao,”the mustached man said proudly.

Qin Yu looked at the mustached man up and down, his eyes full of shock.

“Why are you looking at me like that?”The mustached man covered his chest and muttered, “I’m not interested in men.”

“F * CK Your Grandpa!”Qin Yu kicked his butt.

It had to be said that this mustached man was always able to take out shocking things.

This also made Qin Yu more and more unable to understand the identity of the mustached man.

His spells and magic artifacts were even above the pavilion of heavenly secrets.

“Those who see it will have a share. Later, you have to bring me along,”Qin Yu said.

The mustached man said with a troubled expression, “This won’t do. My formation can only carry one person...”

“Alright, then I’ll go tell Gu Xinghe,”Qin Yu muttered.

When the mustached man saw this, he hurriedly pulled Qin Yu back.

He sighed and muttered, “Damn it, I didn’t see the almanac when I went out. I actually met a bastard like you.”

After he finished speaking, the mustached man glanced at him and said, “Hurry up and keep a lookout for me.”

“No Problem!”Qin Yu patted his chest.

Fortunately, the few martial saints were not around, so Qin Yu and the moustache man’s operation was quite smooth.

After spending about two hours, the moustache man finally succeeded in setting up the formation.

Immediately, the moustache man took out a spiritual artifact that looked like a kasaya from his spatial divine weapon.

He draped the spiritual artifact over the formation and then recited the spell silently. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The spatial teleportation formation in front of him actually slowly disappeared.

This made Qin Yu give him a thumbs up from the bottom of his heart.

“Awesome,”Qin Yu sighed.

“Low-key, low-key,”the mustached man said proudly.

“Alright, let’s go quickly. It will be troublesome if we are discovered later,”the mustached man muttered.

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude and hurriedly left the mountain peak.

After leaving the large spirit stone mine, the two of them returned to the civilian house where Qin Yu had stayed.

Staying in the civilian house, the mustache man said in puzzlement, “Aren’t they all looking for you? Why do you still dare to come out? By the way, where did you get this hat on your head?”

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “We can talk about this later. I have something that I need your help with.”

“I can’t help you. I don’t want to die.”Without waiting for Qin Yu to say anything, the Mustache Man refused.

Qin Yu Glared at the mustache man and said, “Do you still want to go to that big spiritual stone mine?”

Although the Mustache Man was extremely unwilling, he still muttered, “Fine, fine, fine. You’re really the F * cking ancestor of moral kidnapping.”

Qin Yu did not pay attention to these words. He said in a deep voice, “In three days, those martial saints will definitely think of ways to get rid of Xu Huaigu.”

“What does it have to do with me?”The mustached man muttered.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Xu Huaigu is the only martial saint right now. Everything he did was for our interests. I can not watch him die.”

The mustached man laughed coldly and said, “Qin Yu, are you crazy? There are seven martial saints. Even if the three martial saints from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association don’t make a move, there are still four of them!”

“Four martial saints? What can we do with just you and Me?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Indeed, we can’t do it with just us. But if we rely on those two corpses in my hands... We will definitely have the strength to fight.”

“You want to resurrect those two corpses again?”The mustached man said with a frown.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Not only must we resurrect them, but we must also let them resurrect themselves.”

Upon hearing these words, the mustached man immediately drew in a breath of cold air!

He grabbed Qin Yu and said in a shocked voice, “If those two corpses were to be resurrected on their own, you know better than me what the consequences would be!”

“Their threat is greater than those seven martial saints!”

Qin Yu said in a cold voice, “So what? I would rather let them not differentiate between friend and foe than watch those seven martial saints beat Xu Huaigu to death.”

The mustached man was stunned as if he was frightened by Qin Yu’s thoughts.

He was silent for a moment before he shook his head and said, “I can’t do it.”

Qin Yu looked at the mustached man and said, “You can do it as long as you want to.”

The mustached man shook his head and said, “You think too highly of me. I don’t have the ability to resurrect those two corpses that have surpassed the almighty level.”

At this point, the moustache man changed the topic and continued, “However, you can try using the same method as last time. You can use that picture to summon those two corpses.”

“Will it succeed?”Qin Yu asked.

The moustache man shook his head and said, “I don’t know. You can only try.”

Qin Yu instantly fell silent.

He pondered for a long time before finally sighing slightly and saying, “I hope we won’t need them.”

The mustached man smiled bitterly and said, “I don’t want to see them resurrected.”

...

Qin Yu didn’t leave the house for the rest of the time.

At this time, the conflict between the martial artists in the mystic realm and the martial artists in the present age broke out again.

Under the leadership of Qiao Zun, the martial artists in the various mystic realms attacked the disciples in the present age one after another.

It seemed that they wanted to suppress the martial artists in the present age and make them completely submit.

The most vicious one was still the Wan Gu Qiong!

He showed no mercy to the current generation martial artists, and his methods were extremely cruel.

Kong Yun, Yao Mengchu, and the others attacked one after another, although they temporarily eased the pressure.

However, among the current generation martial artists, experts like Kong Yun and Yao Meng were too few, which resulted in the current generation martial artists still being suppressed.

Qin Yu looked at the anger on the martial arts forum and felt very upset.

“If I step into the martial saint realm, I will definitely kill all of them.”Qin Yu secretly clenched his teeth.

The first thing to do after stepping into the martial saint realm was to destroy the Wan family’s Secret Territory!

Two days later.

There was only one day left before the conference.

Qin Yu, who was lying on the bed, suddenly thought of something. He quickly walked to the room with the handlebar moustache.

“What?”The handlebar moustache, who was doing lewd things, hurriedly pulled up his pants.

Qin Yu was a little speechless, but he did not care about this matter. Instead, he asked directly, “Do you know the secret realm of the Yan Family?”

“The secret realm of the Yan Family?”

Hearing this, the handlebar moustache immediately jumped up from the bed.
