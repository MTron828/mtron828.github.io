Chapter 335: The Secret of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu originally wanted to leave the Divine Alchemist Pavilion to avoid bringing trouble to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

However, the Fifth Elder rejected Qin Yu’s idea. He shook his head and said, “Let’s talk about it when the Pavilion Master returns.”

“If you leave now, you will really bring trouble to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

Qin Yu thought for a moment, then nodded and said, “Alright, I’ll agree to it.”

As a man, he had to bear the responsibility. It wasn’t Qin Yu’s style to just leave like that.

Then, Qin Yu and Taozi left the consultation room together.

After returning to their residence, Taozi said in a deep voice, “When the Pavilion Master comes back, I will also testify for you. I believe that other people will also testify for you.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Don’t think too much about it. Just focus on refining pills.”

Taozi nodded and turned around to walk back.

The Divine Alchemist Pavilion had an extremely rich stock of herbs. Even the herbs used by the alchemists to practice their skills had medicinal effects that lasted for decades.

Those that were more than a hundred years old weren’t worth mentioning in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

“Since I’ve come to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion once, I can’t just leave empty-handed,” Qin Yu thought to himself as he sat in the room.

According to the rules of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, he had the right to receive medicinal herbs for practice.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu stood up and walked towards the storage room. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The storage room of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion was extremely huge. The moment he got close, Qin Yu smelled a strong herbal aroma.

And at the entrance of the storage room, there were two apothecaries in charge of registering and receiving the medicinal herbs.

Qin Yu walked forward and indicated his identity and intentions.

The two pharmacists looked at each other, then took out a form and placed it in front of Qin Yu.

“Mr. Qin, please register first,” the two of them said politely.

Qin Yu took the form and looked at it carefully.

Besides the name of the boarding party, there was another column on the form that stated the number of herbs to be collected.

Qin Yu pointed at this column and asked, “How much can each person receive?”

The two apothecaries smiled and said, “In theory, there is no limit to the number of herbs, but everyone usually receives eight to ten stalks each time.”

Qin Yu was immediately shocked!

There was no limit to the number of herbs? Wasn’t this a little too good to be true?

The resources of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion were really much more abundant than Qin Yu had imagined!

“Then I’ll take one hundred herbs first.” Qin Yu immediately filled in the last column with a number of one hundred.

“Alright, please wait a moment.” An apothecary stood up and went to the storage room while Qin Yu sat there and waited quietly.

A few minutes later, the apothecary walked back.

He said apologetically, “Mr. Qin, I’m very sorry. I’m afraid you can’t take the herbs.”

“Why?” Qin Yu, puzzled, asked.

The apothecary didn’t know how to explain for a moment. He stood there and stammered, but was unable to speak.

“An apothecary who is about to be expelled from the Divine Alchemist Pavilion wants to receive the herbs?” At this moment, another person walked out from the storage room.

This person was none other than the Third Elder.

Upon seeing the Third Elder, Qin Yu immediately understood.

He sneered and said, “So it’s you, this old trash, who is causing trouble.”

Upon hearing the words “old trash”, the Third Elder’s expression instantly changed!

“You... What did you call me?” The Third Elder glared at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “What, you haven’t heard enough of it? Fine, I’ll repeat it again.”

“Old Trash, old b*stard, old b*stard, old fart, which one do you like better?” Qin Yu said with a smirk.

The Third Elder’s face was livid with anger. He pointed at Qin Yu and said angrily, “You... you...”

“What about me? I’m your daddy. Get lost!” Qin Yu sneered.

The Third Elder was so angry that his whole body was trembling!

In all his years in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, no one had ever humiliated him like this!

The Third Elder held back his anger and said, “Qin Yu, I’m an elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion! Don’t you know what it means to be superior and inferior!”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “I’m sorry, I really don’t know what it means to be superior and inferior.”

The Third Elder knew that he wouldn’t be able to outargue Qin Yu, so he sneered and said, “Sharp-tongued brat, let me tell you, with me here today, you can forget about taking even half a stalk of herbs!”

“Oh really? Is that so? I’m going to take it today no matter what!” Qin Yu said coldly.

Then, he looked at the two pharmacists who were in charge of distributing the herbs and said, “Go, get me a hundred stalks of herbs.”

The two pharmacists seemed to be in an extremely difficult position as they stood there at a loss.

“Hehe, let’s see which one of you dares to go.” The Third Elder placed his hands behind his back as he said with a proud expression.

“Mr. Qin, we are just office staff. Please don’t make things difficult for us.” The two pharmacists couldn’t help but force a laugh and say.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Don’t worry, I won’t make things difficult for you guys. But today, I will definitely take these herbs!”

After saying that, Qin Yu strode towards the storage room.

“What, are you going to snatch it by force?!” The Third Elder quickly moved forward and blocked Qin Yu’s way.

Qin Yu glanced at him and sneered. “According to the rules of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, I have the right to take the herbs. You don’t have the right to stop me.”

The Third Elder said with a cold expression, “Nonsense! If you dare to take half a step into the storage room, you will be regarded as a rebel! The law enforcement elder won’t let you off lightly!”

“Old fart, don’t put the blame on me. Is it a rebellion just because you say that it’s a rebellion? Who do you think you are?” Qin Yu sneered.

The Third Elder was so angry at Qin Yu that his whole body was trembling, but he had nothing to say.

“Get lost!” Qin Yu scolded coldly.

As his voice fell, a burst of killing intent instantly erupted!

The Third Elder’s expression changed again. He felt a heavy pressure all over his body, and his internal organs were all impacted.

The Third Elder knew that he was no match for Qin Yu, so he pointed at Qin Yu and said, “Fine. Just you wait!”

After saying that, The Third Elder flicked his sleeves and left.

Qin Yu snorted coldly and said, “What a coward.”

After saying that, Qin Yu strode into the storage room.

It had to be said that this storage room was completely beyond Qin Yu’s imagination!

It wasn’t like a warehouse, as Qin Yu had thought.

In fact, this storage room could be said to be a new world! It was somewhat similar to the greenhouses in the countryside.

A large piece of land appeared in front of Qin Yu.

The herbs were vivid and lifelike.

Qin Yu looked at the scene in front of him and couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise, “These herbs... are actually alive?”

He raised his head to look at his surroundings and soon discovered that there was something extraordinary about it.

This storage room was a huge array that was used to absorb the surroundings’s spiritual energy!

Compared to this array, the spiritual energy gathering formation that Qin Yu set up was simply not worth mentioning!

“No wonder the Divine Alchemist Pavilion has such a bountiful storage...” Qin Yu muttered softly.

Even if it was an ordinary herb, under this kind of environment, its growth speed would exceed one’s imagination!

“What kind of person is the Pavilion Master of the Divine Medicine Pavilion? To be able to set up such a grand array...” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh inside.
