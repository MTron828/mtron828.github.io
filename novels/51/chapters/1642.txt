Chapter 1643: Chapter 1643 requests to see the sect master! 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The Godly King’s expression stiffened as he looked at Xiao Sheng’s back. Cold sweat could not help but cover his back!

“I... You...”The Godly King opened his mouth but could not say a word.

“You... actually came back!”After holding it in for a long time, he finally said something.

At this moment, Xiao Sheng’s body was already emitting an intense killing intent.

This killing intent was like the cold wind of the northern lands. It was bone-chilling.

“You have been wandering in my tianyun sect for many days. It’s time for you to pay the price,”Xiao Sheng said coldly.

“Last time, you were also the one who escaped by a fluke from the Rashomon sect, right?”

These words were like a life-threatening talisman. The Godly King knew that all explanations were useless. He immediately made a decision and prepared to use the northern lands’formation to escape!

His body slowly disappeared into the darkness and into the Void teleportation formation!

But at this moment, Saint Xiao also made his move!

He suddenly raised his hand and a pitch-black void black hole rapidly condensed in front of him!

Rashomon!

It was Saint Xiao’s Rashomon!

The Rashomon exploded with an extremely powerful suction force and forcefully pulled the godly monarch who was about to disappear into the darkness out!

“How is this possible!”

The godly monarch’s expression immediately changed drastically!

There had never been any problems with this formation. How could it be forcefully pulled out now! !

The godly monarch’s forehead was covered in sweat. Fear and shock filled his heart!

“No... Don’t!”

The Godly monarch roared with all his might. He watched helplessly as his body was forcefully pulled out of the formation and slowly moved in the direction of the Rashomon!

He used all his spells to escape with all his might, but all of them were useless!

“Save... Save Me, let me go!”

The Godly King panicked. He roared with all his might, but Xiao Sheng was unmoved. There was not the slightest change in his expression.

His body was getting closer and closer to the Rashomon sect. Soon, his entire body was completely devoured by the Rashomon sect.

Everything fell silent, as if nothing had happened.

Xiao Sheng’s face was extremely calm, as if he did not care about this matter at all. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Soon, the news of the northern land godly monarch dying on the cultivation mountain spread.

The many northern land cultivators who remained in the Tianyun sect also began to make guesses.

They were not stupid. There was probably only one person in the entire southern region who could silently kill the northern land godly monarch on the cultivation mountain, and that was the sect master of the Tianyun sect.

For a moment, many northern land cultivators withdrew from the Heavenly Cloud sect. This news quickly aroused the speculations of everyone in the southern region.

“The northern land cultivators suddenly withdrew from the heavenly cloud sect. Something major must have happened.”

“Don’t you know? A godly monarch from the northern land died on the Cultivation Mountain!”

“Yes, rumor has it that the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect has returned! The cultivation mountain has once again been sealed!”

“No wonder. Since Saint Xiao has returned, I’m sure the northern lands will restrain themselves!”

Just as they had guessed, once this news was spread, the cultivators of the northern lands became much more stable. All of their actions came to an abrupt halt.

At the foot of the Cultivation Mountain.

Once again, beams of light appeared, enveloping the entire cultivation mountain.

The vice sect master and the rest knelt at the foot of the mountain, begging to see the sect master. However, they received no response.

...

Teng men.

Yuan Xiu narrowed his eyes. No one knew what he was thinking about.

Two godly monarchs stood beside him. They did not dare to say a word.

“I didn’t expect Saint Xiao to actually return,”Yuan Xiu said with narrowed eyes.

The Godly monarchs beside him asked tentatively, “Master, are you going to look for him?”

The elementalist glanced at him and shook his head slowly. “No, I don’t need to look for him. I’ll wait for him to come and find me.”

“What about us? Should we stop temporarily so as not to anger Saint Xiao...”the two godly monarchs asked softly.

The elementalist sneered. “No, not only do we not stop, we have to make things worse!”

The two godly monarchs said with some confusion, “Once we anger Saint Xiao, it won’t be a good thing for us...”

“What I want is to anger him! I want to see if he will make a move,”the elementalist sneered.

His physical body would not affect the recovery of his original body. Even if he really died in the southern province, the elementalist was not afraid at all.

Although the two godly monarchs were a little puzzled, they did not say anything in the end.

As the absolute resident of the northern region, he..

On the other side.

Qin Yu and Wen wanye were already on their way back.

They sat on the godly eagle, their expressions extremely calm.

After spending a few days, the two of them finally rushed back to the great Yue mountain.

The moment they returned, Wen Da and Wen Er, whom they had not seen for a long time, rushed up.

“Qin Yu, how is it? Did you get any results?”Wen Da asked excitedly.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “It can be considered a success.”

“I knew you would definitely have a bright future!”

“That’s right, that’s right!”

Qin Yu waved his hand and immediately asked, “I heard that many things have happened in the Southern Prefecture recently. Have you heard of it?”

“I know, of course I know. Isn’t it just that Xiao Sheng has returned?”Wen Da waved his hand and said.

“That’s right, that’s right. This fellow is hiding on the cultivation mountain. No one can get close to him. He even killed a divine king of the northern lands,”Wen er added.

Qin Yu was taken aback as he hurriedly said, “What did you say? Saint Xiao is back?”

“That’s right. Don’t you know?”Wen Da said in surprise.

Qin Yu did not answer. His eyes narrowed slightly, and no one knew what he was thinking.

“I want to make a trip to the Tianyun sect,”Qin Yu suddenly looked at Wen Wanyun and said in a deep voice.

Wen wanyun frowned slightly and said, “Why are you going to the Tianyun Sect?”

“I’m looking for Xiao Sheng.”Qin Yu took a deep breath. “I have something to ask him.”

Wen Wanji was silent for a moment before saying, “I’ll go with you.”

“No need.”Qin Yu waved his hand. “If Xiao Sheng really wants to make a move on me, it’s useless for you to go. No one can stop him.”

Wen Wanji opened his mouth, but in the end, he only nodded and said, “Then you be careful.”

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude. He did not waste any time and immediately summoned the Divine Eagle, heading straight for the Heavenly Cloud sect.

All the way to the Heavenly Cloud sect, Qin Yu did not say anything as he headed straight for the foot of the Cultivation Mountain.

At the foot of the mountain, the deputy sect master and the others were kneeling there, begging to see Xiao Sheng.

However, the Cultivation Mountain was completely silent. There was no response.

Seeing Qin Yu rushing over, the deputy sect master hurriedly stood up.

He said in surprise, “Qin Yu, why are you here?”

Qin Yu pointed at the cultivation mountain and said, “Sect master has really returned?”

The deputy sect master said with a bitter smile, “He has been back for many days, but he refused to see us.”

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed slightly. He activated the desolate God’s eye to look at the Cultivation Mountain. Unfortunately, the desolate God’s eye was unable to penetrate this level of radiance.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and shouted, “Qin Yu requests to see the sect master of the Tianyun sect!”

These four words were so loud that it shook the entire cultivation mountain.

“Qin Yu, don’t waste your energy. He won’t see us.”The deputy sect master shook his head.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He was about to request to see him again when the light on the Cultivation Mountain suddenly opened up a path.

“Come up.”

Xiao Sheng’s voice came from the mountain.
