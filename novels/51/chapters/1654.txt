Chapter 1655: Chapter 1,655, facing an elementalist! 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

At this moment, Yongji seemed to have become a joke.

Under the boundless radiance of Qin Yu, he appeared extremely embarrassed.

Only today did Yongji realize that he was no longer the main character. He had long been reduced to the background of others!

Even under such circumstances, everyone only laughed at him for a while before no one noticed him anymore.

At this moment, the elementalist had already slowly stood up.

He looked coldly at Qin Yu with an extremely cold expression.

“If I let you live, you will definitely become a big trouble in the future,”the Elementalist said coldly.

“I was just about to look for you, but I didn’t expect you to deliver yourself to my doorstep.”The elementalist’s tone became even colder, and his voice contained an intense killing intent.

His pupils slowly constricted. Because of the powerful internal Qi on his body, his long hair danced in the wind, making him look like a God and devil.

The onlookers gasped. They seemed to have sensed the extremely intense and terrifying killing intent emanating from the Elementalist!

This killing intent made everyone feel a chill down their spines!

Even qu Zhu could not help but frown slightly.

He had fought against an elementalist before, but he failed in the end and almost died.

“I have nothing to say to you. Kill!”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly shouted. He actually took the initiative to attack!

His entire body was bursting with a strong battle intent. His golden aura was like a vast ocean that filled the entire internal Qi!

Qin Yu’s entire body was filled with arrogance. He did not waste any words and directly threw a punch!

The powerful fist sound was extremely ear-splitting. Streams of power seemed to be continuously overlapping with each other. The power was extremely great!

There seemed to be traces of interweaving on his arms. Like a golden dragon that went out to sea, it shook the entire world!

Looking at Qin Yu’s fist, everyone felt shocked and horrified!

Their gazes were all fixed on Qin Yu’s arm. Those fine lines of lines were terrifying!

The elementalist’s expression was ice-cold. The black radiance rapidly gathered into a seal!

This seemed to be an ancient spell that originated from the immortal slaying sect. It was extremely terrifying!

The huge mark flickered with an immortal radiance and covered the area from top to bottom!

Everyone present felt their hearts skip a beat. Under this powerful internal QI, they could not help but want to worship him!

“Is this the power of the northern Lord...”

Someone muttered softly. Although they had seen elementalists attack before, it happened at the northern border. They had never felt such a pressure at such a close distance!

Faced with such a powerful force, Qin Yu’s face did not turn orange. His entire body emitted a golden light as he pressed forward!

“Boom!”

The two of them welcomed their first collision! At this moment, the void collapsed. The Great Dao rumbled as if it wanted to tell everything to collapse!

The Mark of an elementalist was directly pierced through by Qin Yu’s ultimate physical body. However, the powerful force forced Qin Yu back a few steps!

This collision shocked both of them!

A violent wind blew. Their eyes met. It was extremely cold as if they were trying to figure out the other party’s true strength.

“There’s finally a decent person in the southern region,”the elementalist was the first to speak. His tone was cold and expectant.

He Teng, who was hiding in the dark, narrowed his eyes. There was an indescribable greed on his face!

“Pure physical strength...”he teng grinned and revealed a strange smile.

“Pure physical strength can actually reach such a state. If this physical body is given to me, I will definitely be invincible in the world!”He Teng roared in his heart!

He was getting more and more interested in Qin Yu’s body. He couldn’t wait to take it for himself!

He Teng wasn’t the only one. Everyone present was sighing.

They could naturally see the origin of Qin Yu’s punch. He had used his physical body to punch through an Elementalist’s mark. Such power was unimaginable.

One had to know that even the nine holes from back then were struggling in front of this ancient Mark!

“Kill!”

Qin Yu was incomparably powerful. After a furious roar, he closed in once again!

The elementalist’s entire body was emitting a black glow. This aura spread throughout the entire Ying Ning Mountain, as though it wanted to turn everything into its own internal Qi!

He let out an angry roar and abruptly clasped his hands together. Rays of light erupted from his palms and slashed towards Qin Yu!

“Boom!”

The second collision between the two of them still did not yield any results.

The elementalist’s spells were directly shattered by Qin Yu’s fist. However, Qin Yu was still unable to get even half a step closer to the elementalist.

“This body... is really strange.”The elementalist frowned slightly.

At his level, he had seen so for myself all kinds of physical bodies. The spells that he casually cast would definitely be extremely powerful!

However, the two consecutive attacks did not have any effect. Qin Yu’s body was indeed so powerful that it was incomprehensible!

Everyone present held their breaths. They looked at the scene nervously, afraid that they would miss any details.

Qin Yu looked at the elementalist coldly. The internal Qi in his body continued to surge, and every drop of his blood was boiling!

That invincible fighting spirit made everyone deeply affected by it!

“Elementalist, unleash your true spells. Don’t let the world laugh at you, the Lord of the northern lands,”Qin Yu said coldly.

When the elementalist heard this, he couldn’t help but laugh out loud. “Qin Yu, this body of yours really surprises me. But with this body of yours, it’s impossible for you to defeat me.”

“How would I know if I don’t try?”Qin Yu sneered.

With a loud shout, he stepped on the line word formula and quickly closed in on the elementalist!

The elementalist snorted coldly. With a push of his eyes, a black radiance shot out from his eyes like an army of thousands of horses! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

At the same time, a black aura surged behind the elementalist. A demonic god-like phenomenon appeared!

In an instant, the space could no longer withstand it and collapsed, revealing a large area of pitch-black darkness!

It was a vision! It was a vision produced by an elementalist!

Everyone could not help but exclaim in surprise. No one had expected that the elementalist would use a vision to deal with Qin Yu right after the battle began!

This was enough to prove that even the master of the northern lands had to show his true ability!

That thick black radiance was like a huge water snake as it shot towards Qin Yu, there was practically no place to hide!

Qin Yu’s pupils suddenly constricted, and his body immediately emitted an intense golden light!

Countless rays of light bathed Qin Yu’s body, leaving traces on his body!

Without waiting for Qin Yu to react, that huge phenomenon had already waved its hand over!

The black radiance was like a huge mountain, causing the space to shake and Rumble!

At this moment, no one could withstand the pressure. Even if Qu Zhu and monk Hongxi attacked at the same time, they would not be able to protect everyone!

“Buzz!”

Fortunately, Xiao Sheng raised his palm in time. A holy radiance covered everyone.

This technique was exactly the same as Xiao Hai’s at the northern border!

At this moment, Xiao Sheng’s eyes were fixed on Qin Yu’s direction. He seemed to be looking forward to seeing how Qin Yu would deal with this powerful phenomenon!
