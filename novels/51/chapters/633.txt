Chapter 634: Encounters Yan Guiyi Again! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Yan Shanhe’s voice immediately attracted countless people’s attention.

“The Yan family and the Divine Alchemist Pavilion have always been in conflict. They are probably going to compete this time.”

“Yeah, rumor has it that it’s for Qin Yu’s sake.”

“The Divine Alchemist Pavilion invested a lot in Qin Yu, but now, Qin Yu is dead, so the Divine Alchemist Pavilion has gained nothing. Instead, they have made a lot of enemies.”

“This kind of investment is really too risky. It’s not worth it.”

Everyone discussed animatedly, as if they wanted to watch the drama.

The Pavilion Master silently raised her hand and raised the price, “One billion.”

“One and a half billion!” Yan Shanhe raised his hand and shouted without thinking.

“Two billion.” The Pavilion Master continued to raise the price.

Yan Shanhe sneered. “Three billion!”

The price was instantly raised to an extremely high position.

This also made the Jingdu Martial Arts Association extremely excited. Someone competing was what they liked to see the most.

“Pavilion Master, do we still want to raise the price?” Taozi asked with a frown.

The Pavilion Master’s brows were also furrowed.

Although this rainbow-colored glass was very important, she knew very well in her heart that if she continued to bid, it wouldn’t be of any benefit to her.

“Forget it.” The Pavilion Master took a deep breath and shook her head. “The Yan family and the Jingdu Martial Arts Association have a very close relationship. Continuing to bid won’t be of any benefit to us.”

Taozi nodded and said in a low voice, “The four brothers of the Yan family are really scumbags.”

After the Pavilion Master gave up, Yan Shanhe couldn’t help but sneer. “What? Does the Mighty Divine Alchemist Pavilion only have this little amount of strength? You’re giving up after three billion?”

“Three billion is nothing to the Yan family,” Yan Shanhe said rather arrogantly.

The Pavilion Master kept silent and couldn’t be bothered with Yan Shanhe.

Yan Shanhe stood up and said with a nonchalant smile, “Ji Yuhong, if you are willing to apologize to the Yan family and admit defeat, we might consider forgiving you.”

However, the Pavilion Master still didn’t say anything and even closed her eyes.

Yan Shanhe snorted coldly and immediately walked up to the stage.

The auction of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association was different from other auctions.

They had a unique rule.

The items that were auctioned had to be paid on the spot to avoid unnecessary disputes.

Yan Shanhe walked straight to the stage. He took out a bank card and swiped it on the spot. There was no expression on his face, as if paying three billion didn’t pain him at all.

“Congratulations, Mr. Yan!” The host carefully picked up the rainbow-colored glass and said respectfully.

Yan Shanhe took the rainbow-colored glass and his face was full of pride.

“Ji Yuhong, this rainbow-colored glass belongs to me,” Yan Shanhe shouted from far away.

The crowd burst into applause, and the pride on Yan Shanhe’s face intensified.

“Boom!”

However, at this moment, a loud sound came from the main door!

This loud sound immediately gave everyone a fright!

After turning around, they saw that the main door had been blasted open. The two white-robed men who were responsible for guarding the door had their necks grabbed by a black-robed man.

The black-robed man waved his hand and threw the two white-robed men out.

“You all are being held hostage,” Qin Yu said coldly.

His voice spread throughout the entire venue.

After a short silence, there was a burst of thunderous laughter!

“What did you say? We are being held hostage? Kid, do you know where we are?”

“Holding us hostage in the territory of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association? Are you crazy?”

“Where did this lunatic come from?!”

They couldn’t stop laughing. They simply couldn’t believe that someone would dare to come to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s auction and rob them!

Qin Yu glanced at them coldly and said, “This matter has nothing to do with you guys. I only want the things from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

“Hahahaha!”

The laughter at the scene instantly became even more joyous.

“Is this some new program?”

“I reckon that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association specially invited him to liven up the atmosphere?”

“Want the things from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association? Dream on!”

Qin Yu’s body burst out with cold killing intent in the face of everyone’s snickering.

Then, a scarlet long sword suddenly appeared in his palm!

With a wave of the long sword, a terrifying sword light instantly split the stage in half!

A loud sound entered everyone’s ears.

“I’ll say it again. You all are being held hostage,” Qin Yu said coldly.

At this moment, they realized that the black-robed man wasn’t joking at all! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“It’s him, the black-robed man!” Someone seemed to have thought of something!

“The black robe, the scarlet longsword... it’s him, the black-robed man!”

“The black-robed man who killed nine powerhouses of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?!”

The scene immediately became a mess. Everyone was chattering and fleeing in all directions!

Qin Yu glanced at them and then waved his hand. A golden barrier blocked the door!

“No one is allowed to leave until I’m done,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Black-robed man... We were looking for you. We didn’t expect you to dare to come to our door!” The white-robed men quickly rushed toward Qin Yu in unison!

Qin Yu’s expression was ice-cold. He waved the longsword in his hand, and several bodies were cut in half at the waist! The scene was filled with the stench of blood!

“Ah!!!” Some people in the scene were so frightened that they screamed repeatedly. There were even people hiding under the tables!

Qin Yu ignored the crowd and walked straight toward the stage.

At this moment, Yan Shanhe was still standing on the stage that had been split into two halves.

He held the rainbow-colored glass with both hands while looking extremely embarrassed.

Qin Yu walked quickly to the stage. He glanced at Yan Shanhe and said, “Give me the thing.”

Yan Shanhe frowned and tried his best to remain calm as he said, “Black-robed man, I am Yan Shanhe of the Yan family. I have already bought this thing. I have already paid the money.”

“Then you can only blame your bad luck,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Yan Shanhe said somewhat unwillingly, “Black-robed man, if you are willing to let this go, the Yan family owes you a favor.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh coldly.

Yan Shanhe thought Qin Yu had been persuaded. He struck while the iron was hot and said, “If one day, you are captured by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, I can promise you that I can save your life and even let you join the Yan family!”

“Screw you!” Qin Yu waved his hand and sent Yan Shanhe flying with a slap!

The rainbow-colored glazed also fell into Qin Yu’s hand.

This slap made Yan Shanhe’s face bleed. Although Qin Yu withdrew his strength, Yan Shanhe was just an ordinary person and couldn’t withstand this enormous force.

Everyone present was instantly silenced.

Even Yan Shanhe wasn’t shown any mercy, let alone them?

Qin Yu put away the rainbow-colored glass and then said coldly, “Put back all the items that you have won.”

After saying that, Qin Yu looked at the host and said coldly, “Hand over all the auction items to me.”

The host’s lips kept trembling and he quickly nodded.

“Black-robed man, how dare you?”

At this moment, an extremely powerful internal qi was emitted.

After turning his head, Qin Yu saw Yan Guiyi walking out.

Two black-gold robbed men followed him.
