Chapter 1188: Chapter 1,188. Yan Sihai requests an audience 

The figure who was about to leave stopped in his tracks at this moment.

He still had his back facing the sky blood rainbow as he coldly said, “There are some things that you don’t need to know. If you know too much, you will easily get yourself killed.”

After saying this, he turned into a stream of light and disappeared into the horizon.

...

The next day.

Qin Yu’s spiritual power still showed no signs of recovery.

At this moment, Qin Yu also knew that under the influence of the Twilight Qi, there must be a problem in his body.

“Spiritual power...”Qin Yu was somewhat unwilling.

He tried to cultivate in seclusion and try to take a pill, but there was no effect.

Qin Yu never thought that such a problem would appear at this time.

“Fortunately, I obtained at least one sacred artifact.”Qin Yu took out the sacred artifact brush from within the spatial divine artifact.

The sacred artifact was stained with sacred might.

Even a wisp of sacred might wasn’t something a mighty figure could endure.

Of course, this also depended on who was controlling it.

“Without spirit energy, what use do I have for this sacred artifact?”Qin Yu suddenly realized a problem.

He had no way to control this holy weapon.

“F * ck, does that mean that my trip here was in vain?”Qin Yu even had the intention to curse.

At this moment, the door was pushed open.

Then, he saw the pavilion master walk in from outside the door.

She was holding a medicinal paste in her hand, which was emitting a faint medicinal fragrance.

“What is this?”Qin Yu said with some surprise.

Pavilion master said, “Applying this on your face will be able to lighten your wrinkles.”

“Oh?”Qin Yu was slightly surprised.

He took the medicinal paste and covered his face like applying a facial mask.

Traces of strange heat flowed across his face.

In just a few minutes, the medicinal paste disappeared without a trace, as if it had been completely absorbed by his face.

When Qin Yu looked at the mirror again, he found that the wrinkles on his face had disappeared.

“It’s so effective?”Qin Yu turned pale with fright.

“If I sell it, won’t I Be Rich?”

Pavilion master rolled his eyes and said, “This thing can’t be mass produced. Not only is it extremely harsh on the materials, it’s also very tiring. Other than a few rich ladies, no one has enjoyed it before.”

Qin Yu suddenly came to a realization and said, “No wonder so many rich women look like young girls despite their age.”

“This thing isn’t permanent. It can only last for a year at most,”pavilion master said.

After saying that, she took out a prescription and handed it to Qin Yu.

“With your ability, refining this medicinal paste isn’t a problem,”pavilion master said.

Qin Yu took the prescription and said with a bitter smile, “I shouldn’t be able to use this thing. I think I should be able to find vitality in a year’s time.”

“Just in case,”pavilion master said.

After saying this, pavilion master turned around and was about to leave.

“Pavilion Master, Please Wait a moment.”At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly called out to pavilion master.

He took out the holy weapon and handed it to pavilion master, saying, “This is for you.”

“What is it now?”Pavilion master asked in confusion.

“Saint Weapon, a complete saint weapon.”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Hearing this, pavilion master’s face immediately flashed with surprise.

“A complete saint weapon? This... this is too valuable.”Pavilion master frowned, and after saying this, he wanted to return the brush to Qin Yu.

However, Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Pavilion Master, I don’t want to hide it from you. Ever since I got infected with that Twilight Qi, the spiritual energy in my body has disappeared. This saint weapon is useless in my hands.”

“Moreover... This trip to the holy region is bound to be fraught with danger. As long as this saint weapon is here, not many people should be able to harm you.”

Pavilion master held this saint weapon with mixed feelings in his heart. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

This was a saint weapon!

Even if it was placed in the holy region, it would still be a rare item.

With this saint weapon, not to mention a martial saint, even a mighty figure would not dare to casually make a move.

“Alright, then I’ll keep it for you for now,”pavilion master said.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Alright.”

In the evening, Lu Yun came to “Report to Qin Yu”as usual.

“How was the selection today?”Qin Yu asked.

Lu Yun said, “There’s one who’s not bad.”

“Oh? What’s his name?”Qin Yu was slightly surprised.

“His name is Han Wei,”Lu Yun said.

Hearing this, Qin Yu was immediately shocked!

Han Wei? Wasn’t this kid already unable to recover from his setback? He actually succeeded in being selected?

But thinking about it carefully, Han Wei this kid was also a famous genius in Jingdu back then, ranked in the top ten.

If it wasn’t for that battle with him that caused him to sink into a decadent state, he would probably have achieved something by now.

“What’s the matter? Do you need to kick him out?”Lu Yun asked.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “There’s no need. Since he passed the selection, then it’s his quota.”

“Okay.”Lu Yun nodded. She did not say anything more and turned around to leave.

After Lu Yun left, Qin Yu sat on the chair and waited quietly.

“Why haven’t Tian Xuehong and he teng appeared yet?”Qin Yu could not help but sigh.

“No, before I leave, I must kill them.”

Thinking of this, Qin Yu decided to find Lu Yun and let him spread the news, saying that the selection would end tomorrow.

Just as Qin Yu was about to leave, a disciple suddenly walked in from outside.

“Sect master, Yan Sihai of the Yan family requests an audience,”said this disciple.

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s brows raised, and then the corners of his mouth curled up into a cold smile.

“You’re finally here...”Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed slightly.

“Where is he now?”Qin Yu asked.

The disciple said, “He is waiting for you in the guest hall and seems to have brought a gift.”

“I know.”

Qin Yu got up and walked to the guest hall.
