Yan Sihai looked at Yan Yunheng coldly and said, “Father, you’d better not force me. For the position of the head of the Yan family, I will do anything!”

Yan Yunheng stared at his son and couldn’t help but whisper, “Power has already made you lose your senses.”

“I don’t want to listen to your nonsense!” Yan Sihai roared and his body immediately surged with murderous internal qi!

Although Yan Sihai was a shrewd businessman, he was also a peak Inner Strength Grandmaster!

Yan Yunheng wholeheartedly focused on building his own business empire, and had never dabbled in martial arts!

The two sides faced off, and Yan Yunheng instantly vomited blood!

“This person has repeatedly harmed the Yan family’s interests. I can’t stand it anymore. Drag him out and get rid of him,” Yan Sihai said coldly.

Before he could finish his sentence, two bodyguards ran in from outside the door.

Yan Yunheng was filled with mixed feelings.

Yan Sihai was his own son after all. Now that he was going to commit patricide, how could he not feel anguish?!

Even though he looked calm, he was already heartbroken!

The two bodyguards grabbed Yan Yunheng and strode out!

Yan Sihai’s expression was also somewhat ugly, but in the end, he still let it go.

“I gave you a chance. Don’t blame me.” Yan Sihai snorted lightly.

...

Outside the door, Qin Yu and Yao Qing just happened to arrive at the entrance of the Yan family manor.

Just as they walked to the door, Qin Yu saw Old Mister Yan being dragged out by two bodyguards.

“Old Mister Yan!”

When he saw this scene, Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically!

He instantly appeared in front of the two bodyguards!

Before they could react, Qin Yu had already stretched out his hands and smashed their heads into pieces!

“Old Mister Yan, why are you here?” Qin Yu grabbed Old Mister Yan’s arm and asked anxiously.

Old Mister Yan didn’t say anything. His eyes were staring in the direction of the living room, and there was a hint of anguish in his eyes.

Qin Yu seemed to have guessed something.

His expression turned cold, and he immediately led Old Mister Yan into the living room.

He kicked open the door of the living room and saw Yan Sihai sitting on the sofa while smoking a cigar.

“Yan Sihai, you’re really a beast,” Qin Yu said coldly.

When he saw Qin Yu, Yan Sihai was instantly stunned. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He slowly stood up and sneered. “Qin Yu, how dare you come to the Yan family’s manor?”

Qin Yu ignored him. He pointed at Old Mister Yan and said, “This is your father. Everything you have now was given by him. How dare you try to kill him? Are you even human?”

Yan Sihai sneered. “Qin Yu, what are you talking about? My father was killed by you a long time ago. Who is this person?”

“You!” Qin Yu immediately flew into a rage.

“You, on the other hand, dared to come to the Yan family’s manor alone. Why? Are you trying to get killed?” Yan Sihai’s expression also turned cold.

Qin Yu looked at Old Mister Yan and said in a low voice, “Old Mister Yan, you can leave first. I want to have a chat with Yan Sihai.”

Old Mister Yan frowned and said, “Qin Yu, you...”

“I know what to do,” Qin Yu interrupted Old Mister Yan.

Then, he looked at Yao Qing and said, “Take Old Mister Yan out.”

“Yes, Mr. Qin.” Yao Qing nodded and immediately led Old Mister Yan out of the living room.

Yan Sihai smoked his cigar and sneered. “You little ant, how dare you appear in front of me?”

Qin Yu looked at Yan Sihai coldly and said, “Yan Sihai, I know that you are rich and have a high status, but you only have one life.”

Yan Sihai’s expression changed slightly.

“What do you mean?” Yan Sihai said coldly.

Qin Yu clenched his fist and said, “You don’t even have a bodyguard by your side, and you are only an Inner Strength Grandmaster. What right do you have to be arrogant with me?”

As he spoke, Qin Yu walked toward Yan Sihai step by step.

Yan Sihai was, after all, a person who had experienced all sorts of things. Even under such circumstances, he didn’t panic at all.

“You want to scare me?” Yan Sihai sneered.

“Relying on just yourself, an ant at the bottom? I, Yan Sihai, am much more experienced and powerful than you! Do you dare to touch me?!”

“It seems that you don’t know me very well,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The next second, Qin Yu’s palm suddenly stretched forward!

In the blink of an eye, this slap landed on Yan Sihai’s face!

Although the force was not strong, it was extremely insulting!

Yan Sihai touched his face and his expression turned extremely ugly!

“You dare to hit me?!” Yan Sihai flew into a rage!

He was the head of the Yan family! No one had ever dared to humiliate him like this!

Qin Yu sneered. “Not only do I dare to hit you, but I also dare to kill you!”

As he spoke, waves of intense murderous internal qi burst out from Qin Yu’s body!

He was filled with murderous internal qi!

This might be the best opportunity to kill Yan Sihai! After today, Qin Yu would probably never have the chance to make a move against him again!

Yan Sihai looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Alright, go ahead and try. I can guarantee that if anything happens to me, I will make everyone with ties to you disappear, including Yan Ruoxue.”

Qin Yu’s expression couldn’t help but change.

He didn’t doubt that Yan Sihai really had the ability.

Moreover, killing Yan Sihai wouldn’t solve the problem at all. It would only make the Yan family more chaotic.

In an instant, Qin Yu was like a deflated rubber ball. His murderous internal qi began to disappear bit by bit.

Yan Sihai lit a cigar and said indifferently, “What? Are you giving up just like that? Aren’t you very capable?”

Qin Yu raised his head and looked at Yan Sihai coldly.

“Yan Sihai, it’s easy for me to kill you. The reason why I won’t make a move isn’t because I’m afraid of you,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“It’s just that now isn’t the time. Sooner or later, the Yan family will return to Old Mister Yan’s hands.”

“Hahahaha!” Yan Sihai couldn’t help but laugh when he heard this.

“You’re really arrogant! You’re just a martial artist, so don’t think too highly of yourself!”

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered to talk nonsense with Yan Sihai. He said coldly, “Where’s Ruoxue? I want to see her.”

Yan Sihai sneered and said, “She’s not in the Yan family’s manor. She should be preparing for the wedding at this time. You want to see her? Let’s wait until the wedding tomorrow.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but clench his fists.

He took a deep breath and suppressed the anger inside.

“Yan Sihai, you will pay the price for everything you have done,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Yan Sihai sneered and said, “Let’s talk about it after you survive tomorrow.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He turned his head and walked out of the door.

“Let’s go.” Qin Yu walked in front of Old Mister Yan and forced a smile.

Old Mister Yan didn’t say anything and only nodded his head.

In the living room, Yan Sihai’s expression instantly turned cold.

His entire face flushed red at an extremely fast speed, and veins popped up on his forehead!

“Qin Yu... You dared hit me... I’ll tear you into pieces!!!” Yan Sihai’s furious roar spread throughout the entire Yan family manor!
