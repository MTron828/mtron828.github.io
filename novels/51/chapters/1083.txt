Chapter 1084: Chapter 1,084, you can’t even hold a sword! 

Looking at the scene in front of them, the various realm lords couldn’t help but Exclaim!

“Using his physical body to withstand it, how could his body be so hard! ?”

“That’s the Purple Cloud Sword, the Long Lost Purple Cloud Sword!”

The wielder of the sword wasn’t a weakling, it was Yan Jinyao who was known as the number one disciple in the world!

If they were the ones wielding the sword, the consequences would be unimaginable!

Qin Yu held the purple cloud sword with both hands, his expression extremely cold.

Yan Jinyao tried his best to pull out the sword, but he found that he could not move at all.

Qin Yu’s two hands were like iron pincers, tightly grasping the purple cloud sword!

“Yan Jinyao, is this all you have? You really disappoint me.”At this moment, Qin Yu spoke.

His body emitted a golden might that spread towards Yan Jinyao.

This golden light instantly devoured his purplish-gold light. The scorching internal Qi forced Yan Jinyao back!

Even the purple cloud sword in his hand fell to the ground!

Qin Yu lowered his head and looked at the purple cloud sword that fell to the ground. He could not help but sneer, “You can’t even hold a sword, and you still dare to call yourself the number one disciple?”

“You forcefully swallowed Yan Ruoxue’s blood, and this is all you got? You really disappoint me!”

Yan Jinyao’s expression was extremely ugly. He subconsciously looked around as if he was afraid of the comments around him.

“I... I just made a mistake! I can easily kill you!”Yan Jinyao said angrily.

Qin Yu sneered again and again. With a shake of his feet, the purple cloud sword fell into his hand.

Following that, Qin Yu swung the purple cloud sword in his hand towards Yan Jinyao.

A streak of purple light streaked across the sky and headed straight for Yan Jinyao!

Yan Jinyao hurriedly dodged to the side. The purple cloud sword brushed past his chest and ruthlessly stabbed into a tall mountain behind him!

In an instant, the mountain collapsed and the earth cracked. Broken Stones rolled down as if there was a huge earthquake.

“What? You Don’t even dare to take the sword?”Qin Yu sneered.

Yan Jinyao suddenly understood something!

Qin Yu was not attacking him at all, but returning the sword to him!

Such humiliation made Yan Jinyao almost go crazy!

He grabbed the purple cloud sword and roared angrily, “Qin Yu, you are going too far! You are going too far!”

Qin Yu said coldly, “I will give you one more chance. If you have any moves, just use them.”

Yan Jinyao was beyond furious. He held the purple cloud sword with both hands, and his palms were trembling slightly!

“Qin Yu, you’ve completely infuriated me!”

In the next second, Yan Jinyao suddenly slashed out with his sword and roared with all his might, “Purple Cloud Slash!”

Accompanied by his angry roar, sword shadows filled the sky!

Thousands of purple sword shadows slashed toward Qin Yu in all directions. Each sword shadow had the power to destroy the world!

The cold light on the sword blade was bone-chilling, leaving many sword scars in the air!

The killing intent that spread out made everyone shiver! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Thousands of sword shadows spread out toward Qin Yu, surrounding him with nowhere to hide!

In an instant, thousands of sword shadows slashed at Qin Yu. Even Qin Yu couldn’t Dodge such a sword technique!

“Chi la!”

Ear-piercing sounds came from the center of the sword. The purple light completely enveloped Qin Yu!

“Success!”

When Yan Jinyao saw this, he was instantly overjoyed!

His mouth opened slightly, and he spat out another mouthful of blood essence. It shot towards the sword light, as if he was planning to kill Qin Yu in one strike!

The moment the blood essence entered, the sword light instantly became even more intense!

The originally purple sword Ray was now stained with traces of scarlet. That terrifying aura flame covered a radius of several hundred meters!

The light ray was stirring crazily. Countless sword shadows kept slashing out, as if they were going to cut Qin Yu into minced meat!

The surrounding realm lords hurriedly retreated, afraid that they would be sucked into it!

“Hahaha!”

Seeing this scene, Yan Jinyao shouted out excitedly.

“Qin Yu, you will finally pay for your arrogance. Go To Hell!”Yan Jinyao’s eyes were wide open and his face revealed a crazed look!

But at this moment, the purple sword ray emitted a faint golden color!

The golden color was the size of a grain of rice and it was spreading rapidly at a speed visible to the naked eye!

“Boom!”

A world-shaking loud sound was heard and the sword Ray was instantly blasted apart!

Qin Yu’s body emitted a holy golden light, and the Sword Shadows had long vanished!

Even though countless bloody wounds appeared on Qin Yu’s body, his Qi and blood were incomparably vigorous!

“How... how is this possible!”Seeing this, Yan Jinyao’s expression instantly changed drastically!

The Purple Heaven beheading had clearly swallowed Qin Yu, but why was he safe and sound! !

“Yan Jinyao, I’ve already given you a chance. Is that all you have?”Qin Yu looked at Yan Jinyao coldly with a contemptuous smile on his face.

This smile made Yan Jinyao almost collapse!

At this moment, he was suddenly afraid!

The Man Standing in front of him was like a tall mountain, making him feel fear!

The onlookers also seemed to understand something.

They had always thought that Yan Jinyao and Qin Yu were on par and that he was the only one who could compete with Qin Yu.

However, at this moment, they realized that the gap between the two was like a horizontal ditch that was hard to cross!

The gap between their strength was ridiculously huge!

“This Yan Jinyao... seems to be on a completely different level from Qin Yu...”

“Did we underestimate Qin Yu or overestimate this Yan Jinyao...”

“Could it be that Yan Jinyao only has a false reputation?”

The spectators in the dark murmured.

Han Wei, who was in the crowd, could not help but sneer.

“Back then, when I lost to Qin Yu, you all laughed at me. Now, it’s finally your turn.”Han Wei sneered.

In front of him, Qin Yu was looking at Yan Jinyao coldly.

“Impossible! I will never lose to you!”Yan Jinyao roared as the purple cloud sword in his hand swung towards Qin Yu in a disorderly manner!

At this moment, Qin Yu stepped on the ‘xing’character and arrived in front of Yan Jinyao in the blink of an eye.

He extended his golden palm and slapped the body of the purple cloud sword directly.

“Clang!”

A huge force followed the purple cloud sword and headed straight for Yan Jinyao’s palm!

Under this huge force, the purple cloud sword instantly fell off, and his thumb and forefinger were shaken until they were covered in blood!

“You have already fallen twice.”Qin Yu grabbed the purple cloud sword in his hand and said coldly.

Yan Jinyao opened his mouth. He was about to say something when Qin Yu’s Golden Palm had already slapped over!

“Pa!”

This palm was incomparably huge, and it slapped towards half of Yan Jinyao’s body. His body was like a cannonball, bursting out and smashing fiercely into the ground!

“Ah! !”

Yan Jinyao roared furiously. His entire body was covered in blood and there were even bones that were shattered. It was a tragic sight!

“Qin Yu, you’re finished, you’re finished!”Yan Jinyao roared crazily.

The bracelet on his wrist suddenly emitted wisps of white mist.

This mist covered Yan Jinyao’s body and stuck to every inch of his skin!

The dust covered Yan Jinyao’s body with a layer of armor like lime level!

“Huh? What is this?”Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and a hint of surprise flashed in his eyes.
