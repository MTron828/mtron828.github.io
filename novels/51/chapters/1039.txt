Chapter 1040: Chapter 1,040, the true power of the Soul Bell!

“Qin Yu has won!”

Cheers erupted from the crowd!

The crowd was overjoyed and kept shouting!

The disciples in the mystic realm couldn’t help but sigh.

Even Zhai Xing had lost. How could their Mystic Realm Stop Qin Yu’s invincible power?

Amidst the shouts, Qin Yu didn’t say a word. He carried Zhai Xing on his back and passed through the crowd, returning to his room.

“Go and call Xiao Qing over.”Qin Yu placed Zhai Xing on his bed and said coldly.

After saying this, Qin Yu raised his palm again and placed it on Zhai Xing’s chest.

Strands of internal QI entered Zhai Xing’s body.

After a series of examinations, Qin Yu’s expression could not help but change slightly.

He saw that Zhai Xing’s meridians were all broken, and he was severely injured!

However, Qin Yu was very clear in his heart that his moves could not possibly injure Zhai Xing to such a state!

“What’s going on?”Qin Yu could not help but frown.

Could it be that he had already been injured before Zhai Xing arrived?

Qin Yu did not dare to be negligent. His fingers tapped on several of Zhai Xing’s acupoints, temporarily protecting Zhai Xing’s heart meridian.

He looked at the extremely weak Zhai Xing and could not help but smile bitterly. “Fortunately, I’m here. Otherwise, you might really die in the wilderness.”

At this moment, Jiang he walked in from outside the door.

Seeing this, Qin Yu hurriedly stood up and said, “Senior Jiang He.”

Jiang he nodded. He looked at Zhai Xing on the bed and said, “Is he okay?”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Zhai Xing’s condition is very strange.”

After saying that, Qin Yu told Jiang he about his diagnosis.

After hearing it, Jiang he was not too surprised. Instead, he raised his head and looked at Qin Yu.

“Don’t you feel that this battle is a little strange?”Jiang he asked.

“HMM?”Qin Yu frowned slightly.

After hearing Jiang he’s reminder, Qin Yu seemed to have noticed something strange.

For example, when Zhai Xing activated the soul bell, he shouted repeatedly. Then, when he could have activated the soul bell a second time, he didn’t stop for a long time.

All of this didn’t match with Changqing.

“Senior Jiang he, could it be... Zhai Xing did this on purpose?”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Jiang he did not make any hasty conclusions regarding this.

Qin Yu’s frown became tighter and tighter.

Why did Zhai Xing do this? What was the point?

At this moment, Little Qing walked in from outside the door.

“Little Qing, come over quickly.”Qin Yu hurriedly waved at Little Qing.

Little Qing walked to Qin Yu’s side. When she saw Zhai Xing on the bed, she could not help but turn pale with fright.

“Master Zhai Xing!”Little Qing covered her mouth and cried out in a small voice.

Qin Yu glanced at her and said, “You know her?”

“Of course. No one in the second secret realm doesn’t know Master Zhai Xing,”said Little Qing.

Qin Yu was even more surprised.

From Little Qing’s tone, she seemed to have a good impression of Zhai Xing.

“Can you tell me the story of Zhai Xing?”Qin Yu pulled a stool and let Xiao Qing sit down.

Xiao Qing nodded and then told Qin Yu everything she knew and heard.

After a short exchange, Qin Yu learned that Zhai Xing was quite popular in the second secret area.

Whether it was the Gu family’s team or the ordinary warriors.

There was only one reason, and that was that Zhai Xing treated people very kindly and did not put on airs.

Other than the title of Master Zhai Xing, Zhai Xing also had another title, and that was General Zhai Xing.

There was no other reason, only because Zhai Xing controlled most of the martial artists in the second mystic realm.

“If it wasn’t for Master Zhai Xing, the Gu family would have long lost the hearts of the people,”said Little Qing.

Qin Yu was slightly surprised and said, “Why do you say that?”

Xiao Qing said with a wry smile, “The father and son of the Gu family are the same. They rely on their strength to do whatever they want in the second mystic realm.”

“As long as the women in the second mystic realm reach a certain age, they will definitely be brought to the palace and be chosen by the father and son of the Gu family.”

“If it weren’t for Master Zhai Xing insisting on abolishing this rule, I’m afraid I would have become a plaything for the father and son of the stock price.”

After hearing Xiao Qing’s words, Qin Yu’s impression of Zhai Xing changed a little.

He rubbed his chin and said in a low voice, “Then why does he still want to serve the Gu Family?”

“I don’t know, but Master Zhai Xing is the trusted aide of the Gu family father and son, and also the person they trust the most,”Xiao Qing said.

Qin Yu did not say anything.

He suddenly guessed something.

Could it be that Zhai Xing really intended to die in this battle? Was that why he stubbornly stood up again and again?

As well as the injuries on his body, had his meridians ruptured before he arrived?

“Xiao Qing, do you know about the Soul Bell?”

At this moment, Qin Yu thought of something.

Xiao Qing nodded and said, “I do. The Soul Bell is one of the top spiritual artifacts of the Gu clan. It is said that when the soul bell is activated, it can absorb the souls of others and turn them into the Soul Bell’s attack.”

“The more people around, the more powerful it will be.” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Hearing this, Qin Yu was immediately shocked!

In that case, Star Harvester did not really use the soul bell?

Before he activated the soul bell, he kept shouting. was he also deliberately dispersing the crowd?

Thinking of this, Qin Yu could not help but feel some lingering fear!

If this soul bell really absorbed the souls of everyone, how terrifying would the power it would unleash be? I’m afraid I have become a dead soul under the bell?
