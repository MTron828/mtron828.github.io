2355 Attack Together

“It’s your turn to make your move.”

” You…” Mei Li bit her lips. “You guys are using the elderly and children as threats. You’ll get your retribution.”

“You don’t have to worry about that.”

Mei Li soared into the sky. Countless blood qi surged from her back and instantly formed an enormous blood river.

That blood river flushed down toward the sect with an earth-shattering force. Azure Firmament Sect instantly trembled violently, as if it would break at any moment.

Mei Li lightly tapped her glabella with two fingers, and the blood river suddenly bubbled as if it was boiling.

The terrifying blood qi instantly soared, and the Heaven and Earth Formation of the Universe instantly exploded.

“The formation is broken.”

Si Qianjing revealed a hint of joy.

However, in just an instant, another light shone.

Suddenly, nine directions lit up with brilliant lights, with the central palace being Kun, while the other eight were arranged in the sequence of “Qian”, “Kan”, “Gen”, “Zhen”, “Xun”, “Li”, “Kun”, and “Dui”.

Nine giant spiritual pillars soared into the sky and then spun rapidly.

The blood river once again entered the formation. Its energy continuously dispersed and dissipated into nothingness in the end.

“Nine Palaces Eight Trigrams Formation. It’s the same as the formation of the Yun family of the great nine aristocratic families. How did Qin Yu set up such a formation?”

Yao Xi revealed a shocked expression.

“He has a formation master under him called Wang Feng. I’ve received relevant information, but I didn’t expect him to have such terrifying attainments in formations. After breaking the formation, we must capture this person.”

Yan Yunfan had already made future arrangements.

Another four or five cultivators attacked the formation, but no one could break through the second layer.

As time passed, the first layer of the Heaven and Earth Formation of the Universe had been repaired.

“Impressive! These two formations could even resist the power of the Peak of True Saint.”

“Attack together! Don’t think that I don’t know your strength.”

It seemed to be the pupil of the Three-eyed Spirit Monkey, and it could detect the spiritual energy fluctuations of each attack.

He suddenly slapped an old woman beside him and directly smashed her head.

The cultivator who had attacked earlier let out a muffled roar. “I’ve already done as you said. Why did you still kill my mother? I’ll fight it out with you!”

The cultivator burst out with intense spiritual energy and rushed toward Yan Yunfan. It was as if he wanted to die with him.

However, his body suddenly stopped in mid-air.

Something seemed to have grabbed him and crushed him into a bloody mist.

“To keep this old woman alive longer, we’ve wasted quite a bit of herb. Even if she dies now, she’s benefited. Moreover, with this bit of strength, he still plays tricks on me.”

Yan Yunfan said indifferently.

Ni Wuxiao and Yao Xi, standing behind him, had unnatural expressions on their faces. When handling matters was concerned, Yan Yunfan was more experienced and vicious than them.

“I’ll give you one more chance. Whoever doesn’t go all out, you’ll know the consequences.”

This time, no one dared to hold back.

In an instant, terrifying attacks landed on the formations. The two formations were operating crazily at the same time.

However, these people focused their attacks on one point, and finally, the formations could not resist them.

“We could have set up two more formations if we had sufficient time.”

Wang Feng looked worried. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“It’s fine. Wang Feng, you’ve already helped a lot. Let’s look at us next.”

“Qin Yu, you hold on for some time. If you can stall for some time, I’ll set up another Formation of Three Thousand Weak Waters. After that, I’ll combine the three formations. At that time, we can even resist the power of heavenly might.”

Wang Feng’s face was somewhat pale. He had been setting up formations these days, and his soul had also been greatly exhausted.

If he hadn’t been taking the Heavenly Deity Pills extravagantly, he probably could not have lasted until now.

“Alright, just do your best. Don’t force yourself.”

Qin Yu looked at Wang Feng’s haggard face and was a little worried.

A group of people walked in. Yan Yunfan stared at Qin Yu with a forced smile.

“I thought you’ve died in the spatial turbulence. I didn’t expect you to be still alive until now. However, everything was in vain. You’ll die here today.”

Qin Yu glanced at him, not looking at him straight at all.

He was a little heavy-hearted. This time, the Holy Region had sent all their top-notch martial artists here!

“Well, under the suppression of the Path of Heaven, everyone can unleash their strength to the limit. What’s the meaning of such a competition? To be able to crush you with the power of the great force is like comparing your strength to that of my aristocratic family. Today, I’ll make you understand how wide the gap is between you and me.”

Yan Yunfan sneered and said. He did not even want to negotiate and wanted to kill Qin Yu with the power of thunder.

“Everyone, attack.”

After witnessing Yan Yunfan’s ruthlessness, those “criminals” no longer dared to hold back.

They attacked with all their might, and Elder Guai blocked Mei Li straightaway.

Jue Wu also moved to stop Chang Ye. Everyone in the Azure Firmament Sect also moved. They also understood that this was a moment of life and death.

Everyone took action one after another to ease Qin Yu’s pressure.

In the distance, a white-robed man slowly walked toward Qin Yu. He slowly pulled out his iron sword.

In an instant, all the swords let out a trembling hum as if they were welcoming their king.

Qin Yu’s heart sank to rock bottom. As expected, Xi Menn had also come.

“One Sword, One World!”

A flash of sword light seemed to arrive before Qin Yu almost instantly, and the massive Suo Lin’s shield blocked in front of him.

Suo Lin’s shield indented deeply, and the power of the world exploded on it.

Almost instantly, Suo Lin’s shield exploded into fragments of spiritual energy. Xi Menn’s sword intent was too destructive.

Even Wu Ji’s robe and the Venerable Fifth Mountain could not resist it.

However, they resisted most of the power, and Qin Yu shattered the remaining sword intent directly.

“Go to hell!”

Yao Xi instantly appeared behind Qin Yu and connected with the corpse of the Yao family’s Celestial Saint.

Taking the opportunity of this moment, a fist had already landed on Qin Yu’s body.

“Bang!”

A bronze light lit up on Qin Yu’s body. It was the Saintly Body Technique.

The Saintly Body Technique that he unleashed with the power of the glazed holy bone was much stronger than before.

Qin Yu allowed the punch to land directly on his body. Two of his ribs were directly shattered by this punch.

However, at this moment, under the Spiritualization Technique, the giant dragon’s shadow suddenly wrapped around Yao Xi, and he could not move.

Then, Qin Yu’s body appeared in front of Yao Xi with a tap.

On both sides of a ray of Sumeru Light, the Fist of Annihilation blasted out directly.

In the Sumeru World, this fist force had already reached the power of half-step heavenly might.
