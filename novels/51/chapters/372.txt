Old Mister Yan’s expression couldn’t help but change, but it was fleeting.

He placed his hands behind his back and looked towards the north. He sighed slightly. “Yan Sihai, you are really ruthless...”

“Do you have anything else to say?” Qiao Wu said nonchalantly.

Old Mister Yan did not show any fear. He had already died once, so he looked calm and collected.

“Kill me in exchange for his life,” Old Mister Yan said as he pointed at Qin Yu who was on the ground.

Qiao Wu sneered. “Don’t you understand? President Yan said that he wants both of you to die!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Qiao Wu suddenly reached out and grabbed Old Mister Yan’s neck!

The huge force instantly made it difficult for Old Mister Yan to breathe!

His entire face turned red, and his neck was almost broken!

“Go to h*ll!” Qiao Wu’s eyes flashed with madness!

At this moment, a sword suddenly slashed down!

The sword light flashed, and Qiao Wu’s arm was forcefully cut off!

“Ah!!!” Qiao Wu couldn’t help but shout out in pain!

Looking over, Qiao Wu saw Qin Yu holding the bronze sword in his hand while glaring at him!

“Old Mister Yan...” Qin Yu looked at Yan Yunheng with difficulty.

Old Mister Yan opened his mouth, and a trace of gratitude couldn’t help but appear in his eyes.

“As long as I’m still standing, I won’t let you hurt him...” Qin Yu supported his body and glared at Qiao Wu.

Qiao Wu said angrily, “How dare you break my arm?! I’m going to kill you!”

Qiao Wu seemed to have gone mad, and his fists smashed toward Qin Yu at a rapid speed!

At this moment, Qin Yu had already lost the ability to resist, and his reaction speed was much slower.

His body was almost smashed into pieces, and his entire body was covered in blood!

“You two, go and kill him!” Qiao Wu pointed at Old Mister Yan and roared.

The two of them looked at each other and immediately walked towards Old Mister Yan.

“Shrinking Ground... Into An Inch!”

At this moment, Qin Yu used his last bit of strength to block in front of Old Mister Yan!

“I said... I won’t let you touch him!” Qin Yu said coldly.

“You’re courting death!” Qiao Wu took a step forward before kicking hard at Qin Yu’s chest!

Qin Yu’s body swayed a little, but he was still shielding Old Mister Yan!

When he saw this, Qiao Wu’s expression couldn’t help but turn cold.

“Let’s see how long you can hold on!” Qiao Wu clenched his fist and smashed it at Qin Yu’s body.

The densely packed punches Qin Yu’s body until it was riddled with holes!

Countless bones were smashed into pieces, and blood gushed out from his mouth like a fountain!

But even so, Qin Yu still stubbornly stood behind Old Mister Yan like an iron tower!

“How is this possible!?” Qiao Wu was about to go crazy!

Even an Inner Strength Grandmaster wouldn’t be able to hold on under this bombardment!

He was only an Inner Strength Past Master, so how did he do it!?

“Qin Yu, don’t force yourself,” Old Mister Yan said in a trembling voice.

Qin Yu opened his mouth to speak, but just as he opened his mouth, blood filled his entire mouth.

“What a lunatic!” Qiao Wu said coldly.

He raised his palm, and a ray of light condensed in his palm.

Then, he saw a shining longsword fall into his hand.

“Go to h*ll!” Qiao Wu roared angrily, then stabbed the sword straight in Qin Yu’s heart!

“PFFT!”

Qin Yu spat out a mouthful of blood, and his vision began to become blurry.

“Old... Old Mister Yan...” Qin Yu’s hand reached out in Old Mister Yan’s direction, but his body fell to the ground.

“Qin Yu...” Old Mister Yan immediately cried.

He didn’t think that Qin Yu would sacrifice himself to protect him.

Qiao Wu snorted. “To prevent any accidents, chop off his head and take it back to report.”

“Okay.” The two Inner Strength Grandmasters nodded. They immediately held sharp blades in their hands and slashed at Qin Yu’s neck.

“Clang!”

Just as the sword was about to land on Qin Yu’s neck, a ray of light flashed and shattered the sword in his hand!

“Huh? Who is it!” The three of them looked into the distance in unison.

“You’re trying to kill an Elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion at the entrance of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. Aren’t you looking down on me?”

A slightly charming voice came from not far away.

After turning his head to look, he saw a woman slowly approaching.

Beside her were eight attendants.

And each of these eight attendants was at the peak of the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm!

“Who are you?” Qiao Wu said coldly.

“How impudent! This is the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion!” The First Law Enforcement Elder roared angrily!

“Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?” Qiao Wu’s expression changed slightly.

He turned around and looked at the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, then he cupped his hands and said, “Greetings, Pavilion Master.”

The Pavilion Master said indifferently, “No matter what grudges there are between the two of you, let this matter rest.”

Qiao Wu frowned slightly. He looked coldly at the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion and said, “The two of them are enemies of the Yan family. Pavilion Master, do you really want to meddle in other people’s business?”

“Meddle in other people’s business? Are you deaf?” The Pavilion Master frowned slightly.

“Qin Yu is an Elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion!” The First Law Enforcement Elder roared angrily.

Qiao Wu’s expression turned cold. He looked coldly at the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion and said, “Mr. Yan Sihai wants them dead. If you interfere in this matter, you will be offending the Yan family!”

“Slap!”

Qiao Wu had just finished speaking when a slap landed on Qiao Wu’s face!

The speed was so fast that even Qiao Wu couldn’t react in time!

“Are you threatening me?” The Pavilion Master narrowed her eyes and asked indifferently.

As soon as she said this, a strong murderous aura burst forth from the eight Law Enforcement Elders.

Qiao Wu’s expression immediately turned ugly!

Especially that slap just now. As a peak Inner Strength Grandmaster, he actually didn’t notice it at all!

“Could it be... that she’s a Martial Marquis?” The more Qiao Wu thought about it, the more frightened he became!

Thinking of this, Qiao Wu cupped his hands and said, “Pavilion Master, it’s my fault for being presumptuous. It’s just that... President Yan has given us a death order. We must kill them.”

“If we can’t kill them, then we can’t go back to see him. I hope you won’t make things difficult for me.”

“D*mn, it seems like you really don’t understand human language!” A Law Enforcement Elder couldn’t help but walk over to Qiao Wu.

Qiao Wu’s body suddenly trembled, and a trace of fear flashed through his eyes!

If they were to fight, the three of them would probably die here today!

Fortunately, at this critical moment, the Pavilion Master waved his hand and stopped the Law Enforcement Elder.

“Whether you can go back or not has nothing to do with me,” the Pavilion Master said indifferently.

“If Yan Sihai wants to seek revenge, or to negotiate, let him come to me.”

After saying this, the Pavilion Master pointed at Qin Yu with her chin to indicate for the Law Enforcement Elder to take him away. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The Law Enforcement Elder immediately accepted the order and walked quickly to Qin Yu.

“Pavilion Master, you can’t take Qin Yu away!” Qiao Wu said anxiously.

However, the Law Enforcement Elder punched him twice in response!
