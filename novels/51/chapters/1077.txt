Chapter 1078: Chapter 1,078, Yan Ruoxue’s world 

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly again.

He looked at the handlebar mustache coldly and said, “What else do you know?”

The handlebar mustache smiled and said, “Don’t worry. I’m just guessing.”

“Guessing? I was abroad at that time. How could you know? Could it be that you followed me?”Qin Yu said coldly.

The Mustache Man hurriedly waved his hand and said, “No, no, no, you misunderstood. I just found something on you that doesn’t belong to this world. It’s just a guess.”

Qin Yu subconsciously touched the token in his pocket, and then looked at the Mustache Man with doubt.

The Mustache Man spread his hands and said, “I’m not lying to you. Really! I swear to God!”

Qin Yu didn’t want to argue with him about this question, so he didn’t continue to ask.

“Are you also from that Star Field?”Qin Yu asked curiously.

The mustache man said seriously, “To be precise, it is.”

“What do you mean it is?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but ask.

The Mustache Man sighed slightly and said, “The person you see now is actually just a strand of my divine sense.”

“A strand of divine sense?”Qin Yu was instantly shocked!

This mustached man’s strength was not weak! It was actually just a strand of his divine sense? Then how powerful was his main body?

“Are you joking?”Qin Yu said with some doubt.

The mustached man said with a sorrowful face, “I also hope that it’s a joke, but this is the truth.”

“Then what about your main body? Why did only a strand of divine sense come to Earth?”Qin Yu continued to ask.

The handlebar mustache sighed slightly and said without blushing, “My main body has always been very curious about the human history of Earth, so I traveled thousands of miles to send a strand of divine sense across the void, in order to...”

“F * ck you! Speak human language!”Qin Yu interrupted the incessant chattering of the handlebar mustache.

The handlebar mustache was slightly embarrassed, and he coughed, with a serious expression, he said, “Actually... I was chased to this point. My main body has already been destroyed. I spent my entire life and exhausted countless treasures to luckily escape a strand of divine sense and come here.”

Qin Yu exclaimed, “Really?”

“Yes.”The moustache man nodded.

Seeing that he didn’t seem to be lying, Qin Yu became even more curious.

“Who was chasing after you? Why were they chasing after you?”Qin Yu continued to ask.

The Mustache Man’s old face turned red as he muttered softly, “Sigh, I accidentally offended a big aristocratic family...”

“A big aristocratic family? Why would you offend a big aristocratic family?”Qin Yu was a little surprised.

The Mustache Man’s face instantly turned even redder as he muttered softly, “I observed the sky at night and realized that there was a babe in his house, so I went to his house to take a walk.”

“Who would have thought that the aristocratic family was too stingy. They actually gathered a few people to surround me and stop me.”

“Sigh, the morals of the world are really declining. Damn it, it’s so difficult to even take an ancient examination.”

Qin Yu’s old face turned black. He couldn’t help but ask, “Did you dig up his ancestral grave?”

“Cough Cough.”The mustached man coughed dryly and said shamelessly, “That can’t be called digging up an ancestral grave. That’s called archaeology, understand?”

“Serves you right.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse in his heart.

The mustached man stood up straight and said with some pride, “This venerable self is just unwilling to lower himself to their level. Otherwise, why would he be hunted down by them?”

“To put it bluntly, this venerable self only wants to come to Earth for archaeology. After all, so many great cultivators who have transcended the tribulation have come before.”

“Alright, stop bragging. Let’s Get Serious.”Qin Yu waved his hand and said.

“Then what exactly is your true body’s cultivation level?”Qin Yu asked.

At the mention of these words, a trace of pride immediately appeared on the Mustached Man’s face.

“My true body is a genuine almighty. Back then, no one in the world could stop it!”The mustached man sighed.

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

He didn’t expect that this mustached man was actually a mighty figure!

“Even a mighty figure would be hunted down to this extent?”Qin Yu gasped.

The moustache man said seriously, “Qin Yu, there are more capable people in this world than you can imagine! Even I was hunted down by many star domains and almost died.”

“To be honest, the reason why I came to Earth is also because of the existence of the Dao Protector. Otherwise, it’s very likely that they would descend here and wipe out my last trace of divine sense.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

This time, the nonsense was extremely serious.

“The Dao Protector is also my father,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

If this was the case, his father’s strength should be above that of a mighty figure. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be to the extent that those aristocratic families wouldn’t dare to come to Earth to cause trouble.

“Since you’re at the level of a mighty figure, you should have a clear understanding of the strength of a mighty figure,”Qin Yu said.

“Let me ask you, with my current strength, how much is the difference between me and a mighty figure?”

The Mustache Man’s face darkened, and he looked seriously at Qin Yu, he said word by word, “A lot. Qin Yu, with your talent, you can be considered a genius even in that star field, but there is no lack of geniuses in this world.”

“I know of no less than a hundred aristocratic family members who are not weaker than you, and many of them have already stepped into the mighty figure realm.”

“Even those eight high-ranking officials of the martial arts association in Jingdu are nothing in that star field.”

Qin Yu immediately felt a trace of pressure.

“Since you’ve said so much, I can tell you some things directly.”The mustached man stood up and said.

With his back facing Qin Yu, he said in a deep voice, “The Yan family is one of the top aristocratic families in that star field, and an awakened one with a complete bloodline has an extremely high status in the Yan family. It’s so high that you can’t imagine it.”

The Mustache Man turned around to look at Qin Yu and said, “Although the chaotic body is one of the strongest physiques, it might not be able to catch the Yan family’s attention. Because the physiques that are not weaker than the chaotic body are everywhere.”

“If you want to stand out among them, you have to put in more effort.”

“Also, the awakened one with a complete bloodline of the Yan family will definitely be famous in that star area. I’m afraid that there will be countless people who want to marry him.”

Hearing that, Qin Yu felt a great pressure. His desire for power was even stronger.

“Power... I’m afraid I need more power.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.
