2240 The Man with the Mustache’s Plan

His internal organs became as hard as steel bars, and the vital energy enveloped the entire ring of Sumeru.

“Thump, thump, thump!”

His heart began to beat violently. The man with the mustache and Elder Guai nearby could hear the powerful heartbeat.

Qin Yu panted lightly. He seemed to be able to draw spiritual energy into his body. Elder Guai, by the side, could even feel the vibration of his lungs.

“F*ck, did Qin Yu mutate? Why do I feel like facing a demonic beast?”

The man with the mustache gasped.

Qin Yu opened his eyes and suddenly jumped out.

“It’s a pity that this blood water is still not enough. My body would have become even stronger if I had enough blood water.”

At this moment, Qin Yu could feel that his physical body was incredibly terrifying. Even if he did not use any cultivation technique, he could break the void with a punch.

The meridians in his body were like elastic bands, and his bones were as hard as diamonds. A punch thrown was like an arrow leaving the bow.

However, he still felt a lingering fear at this moment. This blood river actually had its own consciousness. It could even destroy his soul effortlessly. If it weren’t for his Divine Dragon Power deceiving that trace of will, he might not have a chance to come out from that pool of blood water.

“How is it? How do you feel?”

The man with the mustache asked curiously. He came over and pinched Qin Yu’s skin.

“This blood water is indeed tremendously beneficial to the physical body and has a tempering effect on the soul. You can try if you have a chance. But you have to be prepared in advance. I nearly died just now.”

Qin Yu said with a smile.

“I won’t do such things. I’m only interested in treasures. You can keep these perverted and cruel things to yourself.”

Recalling the scene of Qin Yu shedding his skin, the man with the mustache could not help but shiver.

“Try this move of mine! White Bird Paying Homage to the Phoenix!”

The man with the mustache suddenly waved his hand, and a formation enveloped Qin Yu.

The air suddenly became hot as if it slowly ignited.

Amid the fiery clouds, hundreds of firebirds took shape.

The next moment, these firebirds let out a shrill cry and charged toward Qin Yu.

As Qin Yu also wanted to test the strength of his physical body, he allowed the firebirds to crash into his body.

“Boom!”

Enormous flames instantly surrounded him. Qin Yu only felt a burning sensation but without other injuries.

“F*ck, this is too abnormal! My White Bird Paying Homage to the Phoenix is a formation that can even kill True Saint! You actually resisted it with just your physical body?” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The man with the mustache shouted.

Qin Yu felt a burning sensation in his heart. If he could obtain more bone cultivation water, his physical body would improve further! He would have another trump card when he returned to the Holy Region in the future.

After using the bone cultivation water, Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the ground.

He carefully recalled another technique, the Spiritualization Technique.

When he used the desolate divine eye, he had secretly learned the Spiritualization Technique.

With a thought, the giant demon fox instantly took shape, and dozens of massive arms slowly grew from its back.

However, it could not continue to grow. The six-tailed demon fox earlier could only have a hundred arms at most.

Moreover, the shape was ever-changing. When Annihilation Space took shape, it transformed into an eagle and escaped.

However, Qin Yu could only form a fixed shape. He had little contact with soul-cultivating techniques previously. He was thus a little confused now.

He threw out dozens of punches, and the terrifying power increased.

After refining his Sea of Soul, the Spiritualization Technique was even more powerful this time.

The attack of the soul was like killing a thousand enemies and losing eight hundred.

Once the soul was damaged, the recovery would be tremendously troublesome, and it might even leave behind serious aftereffects.

For example, Qin Yu’s soul had to use the cultivation technique of the underworld to recover.

However, the Spiritualization Technique could directly materialize attacks, so there was no such fear. Coupled with his physical body, he would not be afraid unless he encountered a peak True Saint.

Qin Yu secretly calculated.

“The man with the mustache, why are you sneaking around here? Why didn’t you go out for so long?”

Qin Yu looked at the man with the mustache curiously. Suddenly, his expression changed.

“Did you find some treasures? Quickly tell me.”

The man with the mustache felt a little guilty and waved his hand repeatedly. “I’m just practicing the formation. I didn’t do anything.”

“Quickly tell me. There must be something fishy about you coming from the Holy Region to this godforsaken place.”

The more Qin Yu thought about it, the more he felt the man with the mustache was hiding something from him.

The ginseng demon transformation had already come to an end, but this fellow had not left. He must have another plan.

“Don’t pull my clothes, don’t pull my clothes. I always act according to my will. When it’s time to tell, I naturally will tell. Now, don’t disturb me from studying the formation.”

The man with the mustache was very stubborn and refused to admit it.

“You must tell me if there’s anything. I’ll do my best to help if I can.”

Qin Yu said with a smile, secretly thinking he must keep an eye on this guy.

“Okay, okay, okay! Get lost. Don’t disturb me from work.”

The man with the mustache was like chasing a fly away.

A wave of Sumeru energy enveloped Qin Yu. In the next moment, Qin Yu returned to his room.

The cultivation this time took half a month.

The Soul-hunting Bell emitted a faint fluctuation from his body, but Qin Yu did not notice it.

“Lady Boss, I want to ask you something.”

Qin Yu came before the lady boss of the Moon Listening Pavilion.

“Tell me about it. The price depends on the specific situation.”

Ji Yue put her hands on her hips and said with a smile.

“There’s a cultivator on the Black Platform Continent called Wang Feng. He was taken away by the Blood Sect. I want to know where he was taken to.”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said.

“Haha, Little Brother, the Blood Sect is located on the eighth level of purgatory. Everyone knows this. However, you have to find the exact location yourself. No one can open the entrance without the Blood Sect’s talisman.”

Ji Yue laughed hysterically.

Qin Yu sighed. The sects in this galaxy were among the chaotic factions. There were countless small sects and factions. It would take a lot of time to find him.

Qin Yu thought about it for a moment. Piao Ruoyun had returned to the sect to absorb the six-tailed fox king’s inner core, so she should not be returning to Solitary Coud City so soon.

Many powerful demons were still on the seventh level, especially the giant ape that had smashed its body with one blow.

Although he had advanced quite a bit, it was still safer to wait and form a team with Piao Ruoyun.

After thinking for a while, he went to the central square of Solitary Cloud City.

Qin Yu walked to a stall selling magical artifacts. The stall owner was a short and muscular dwarf. His body was emitting a strong smell of sulfur.

“Do you repair magical artifacts?”

Qin Yu asked.

“Take it out and show me,” the dwarf said impatiently.

Qin Yu took out the Supreme Mountain of the Five Elements and Wu Ji’s robe. After resisting the attack of the Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivator, he could no longer activate these two treasures.

“Good stuff!”

The dwarf’s eyes lit up.
