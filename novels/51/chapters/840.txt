Chapter 841: Wan Guqiong Made His Move!

Wan Guqiong’s expression was ice-cold and gloating. His expression was completely different from his previous gentlemanly demeanor.

“As expected.” Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed slightly.

Just as Qin Yu had thought, Le Xian was really found by Wan Guqiong.

“Qin Yu, now that the exit of this Mystic Realm has been closed, you can just wait here to die!” Wan Guqiong laughed loudly.

Qin Yu said coldly, “Wan Guqiong, the day I step into the Martial Saint realm will be the day the Wan family is destroyed.”

“Haha, you won’t have that chance.” Wan Guqiong said these words and walked to the side.

Zhuang Teng, who was at the side, walked forward and said, “Brother Qin, it’s better not to provoke Wan Guqiong here. If there’s no other way, you can apologize to him. Whatever conditions he wants, you can temporarily agree to it and escape first.”

Qin Yu bowed slightly to Zhuang Teng and said, “Thank you.”

After saying that, Qin Yu walked to the square and found a place to sit down.

He took out the treasures he had prepared long ago from the Spatial Magic Artifact, as well as a plate.

On the plate were a few words: all items are to be exchanged with ten-thousand-year-old herbs.

After that, Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly.

In front of Qin Yu, there were Divine Rank spells and Divine Rank pill formulas. Each of them could be considered top-notch.

Qin Yu sat there quietly waiting for the start of the exchange meeting.

This exchange meeting was held for the first time, so there weren’t many people participating, but the quality was extremely high.

Among these people, almost all of them were from top aristocratic families, so the treasures in their hands were naturally countless.

Qin Yu released his divine sense to cover his surroundings.

Soon, he found many herbs.

These herbs could be considered top-notch. Among them, there were at least three ten-thousand-year-old herbs.

If he could get these three ten-thousand-year-old herbs, then Qin Yu could directly go into closed-door cultivation.

Of course, this was simply impossible. If he could get one, he would be burning incense.

Time flew by, and soon, the exchange session began.

When someone passed by Qin Yu’s stall, they would bend down and carefully observe it.

“God Buddha’s thousand hands? This is a Divine Rank high-tier spell. I wonder if my artifact can be exchanged with yours?” Someone walked forward and said.

Qin Yu shook his head. He pointed at the sign and said, “I only want ten-thousand-year-old herbs. I’m sorry.”

“What a pity.” The other party shook his head and walked to the side regretfully.

“Divine pill formula? Divine Rank Pill Formula? Friend, I have an eight-thousand-year-old herb in my hand. I wonder if I can exchange it with you?” Another person walked forward and said.

Qin Yu still shook his head and said, “I’m sorry. I only want ten-thousand-year-old herbs.”

The other party’s face was full of regret, but he still walked to the side obediently.

Countless people passed by, but unfortunately, none of them had ten-thousand-year-old herbs.

In the blink of an eye, three hours had passed.

It was already noon, but Qin Yu didn’t find anything.

However, he wasn’t in a hurry. After all, it wasn’t that easy to obtain ten-thousand-year-old herbs.

“Qin Yu, why are you so obsessed with ten-thousand-year-old herbs?” At this moment, Kong Yun walked over from not far away and sat beside Qin Yu.

“10,000-year-old herbs are extremely precious. For our cultivation, most of us would choose herbs that are around 5,000 years old. That is the most cost-effective herb.”

Qin Yu glanced at Kong Yun and said perfunctorily, “Maybe I am more stubborn and have obsessive-compulsive disorder.”

Of course, this wasn’t what Qin Yu was thinking. The reason why he didn’t choose herbs that were around 5,000 years old was because 5,000-year-old herbs were no longer of any use to Qin Yu.

Right now, Qin Yu could only choose herbs that were more than 10,000 years old.

Time passed in the blink of an eye from morning to afternoon, but unfortunately, there were still no 10,000-year-old herbs to inquire about.

“Tsk, you even took out the cosmic form?” At this moment, someone walked over.

The person who spoke was an old man.

This person looked calm, but one could still sense that he wasn’t ordinary.

“Do you know the cosmic form?” Qin Yu asked.

The old man narrowed his eyes and said, “The cosmic form isn’t a simple Divine Rank spell. As far as I know, it was once used by the Guardian. Where did you get it?”

“This has nothing to do with you.” Qin Yu closed his eyes again.

The old man smiled faintly and said, “Do you know that if you take out the cosmic form, you might be targeted?”

Qin Yu glanced at the old man and said indifferently, “Since I dare to take it out, I’m not afraid of being targeted.”

“How cocky.” A trace of surprise flashed across the old man’s face.

Qin Yu ignored him and closed his eyes again.

This exchange would last for three whole days, so Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry.

If he really couldn’t get ten-thousand-year-old herbs, Qin Yu could only give up.

The sky gradually darkened, and the number of people in the exchange hall began to decrease.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh slightly.

It seemed that it was impossible to get the ten-thousand-year-old herbs today.

Just as Qin Yu was about to pack up his stall and leave, a change of circumstances appeared.

A girl walked over from not far away. This person was dressed luxuriously and had a graceful appearance.

She walked directly to Qin Yu, then stared at Qin Yu’s sign and muttered, “Only ten-thousand-year-old herbs...”

After saying that, she looked at Qin Yu and said, “Can ten-thousand-year-old herbs be exchanged for all the things in your stall?”

Qin Yu opened his eyes and said, “If you have them, yes.”

The girl stared at the things in the stall and muttered softly, “There are many things in this stall. A ten-thousand-year-old herb won’t be a loss...”

Thinking of this, she actually took out a ginseng and handed it to Qin Yu.

“I want these things!” The girl said excitedly.

Qin Yu looked closely. What she was holding in her hand was actually a ten-thousand-year-old herb!

“Okay, the things are all yours.” Qin Yu hurriedly stretched out his hand to take the ginseng.

But at this moment, a palm reached out and slapped Qin Yu’s wrist.

His strength was extremely great, and he directly slapped Qin Yu’s hand to the side.

Qin Yu saw an old man coldly looking at him.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “What do you mean?”

“Nothing. I don’t like you. What’s the matter?” The old man sneered.

Before he finished his words, Wan Guqiong walked over from not far away.

“Young Master Wan.” After the old man saw Wan Guqiong, he immediately bowed slightly.

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold as he said, “Wan Guqiong? Is this one of your men?” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Wan Guqiong sneered. “Qin Yu, I’ve already let you live for another day. How are you going to thank me?”

As he spoke, another old man appeared beside him.

These two old men stood in front of him, and their bodies emitted a terrifying internal qi.

“Martial Saint?!” Qin Yu’s expression couldn’t help but change.

Although both of them had restrained their internal qi, that powerful pressure still allowed Qin Yu to quickly see through their realms!
