At this moment, Xiao Yu was sitting cross-legged, absorbing the dark energy in this space wholeheartedly. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Qin Yu’s expression became extremely ugly.

The people around him seemed to be well-dressed, but in fact, they were lewd at heart. No one knew what would happen.

“Huh? There’s a woman?” Jing Shihong’s eyes lit up, and his gaze instantly fell on Xiao Yu.

“Why is there a girl here?”

“She seems to be relying on dark energy to cultivate. This is an unorthodox sect!”

Jing Shihong stepped forward. He patted his chest as he volunteered, “I, Jing Shihong, have always had zero tolerance towards unorthodox sects! Leave this unorthodox sect to me!”

“I’m willing to lend Mr. Jing a helping hand!” Bi Guocang also hurriedly stepped forward.

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely unsightly. Xiao Yu was only a child. If she was hurt by these jerks, Qin Yu definitely wouldn’t tolerate it!

“Young Master Yan, what do you think?” Everyone looked at Yan Haoran in unison.

Yan Haoran’s gaze was somewhat indifferent. He glanced at Xiao Yu and said, “Deal with her as you wish.”

Yan Haoran’s permission immediately made Jing Shihong and Bi Guocang feel relieved.

They walked in front of Xiao Yu quickly.

Then, Jing Shihong patted Xiao Yu’s shoulder and woke her up from her cultivation.

When she saw this group of people, Xiao Yu’s expression changed slightly.

“Who... Who are you people?” Xiao Yu asked in surprise.

Jing Shihong put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “We should be the ones asking you this! You’re so young, but you’ve actually come to such a dangerous place!”

“Speak! Are you a devil that grew up on this battlefield?” Bi Guocang also shouted.

Xiao Yu sat up from the ground and said with a glare, “Are you crazy? I’ll come if I want to. It’s none of your business!”

“You speak so rudely and cultivate dark energy. You must be a devil!” Jing Shihong shouted.

After saying that, he reached out and grabbed Xiao Yu’s arm!

Jing Shihong was, after all, a peak-stage Inner Strength Grandmaster. His strength couldn’t be underestimated, and he wasn’t someone that Xiao Yu could resist.

Xiao Yu couldn’t move at all.

“Let Go of me quickly!” Xiao Yu struggled and said.

“Hmph, today, I will get rid of you, you little devil!” Jing Shihong said righteously.

Although he said so, his eyes revealed a lascivious expression.

Xiao Yu struggled crazily and said angrily, “You’re the devil! It was my friend who brought me here!”

“Oh really? Your friend? Who’s your friend?” Jing Shihong raised his eyebrows and asked.

“Since your friend brought you to this kind of place, I think he’s also a devil!” Bi Guocang shouted.

Hearing their conversation, Qin Yu immediately got a bad feeling.

If Xiao Yu said his name, then... she would be even more screwed!

“If I say his name, you’ll be scared to death! He’s the King of Chuzhou, Qin Yu!” Xiao Yu said arrogantly.

“Qin Yu?” Everyone looked at each other and then burst into laughter.

“Your friend is actually Qin Yu! We are planning to settle the account with him!”

“Young Master Yan, this little devil has a good relationship with Qin Yu!”

Yan Haoran’s gaze gradually turned cold.

He slowly walked up to Xiao Yu and said coldly, “You said your friend is Qin Yu?”

“Yes!” Xiao Yu snorted.

Yan Haoran slapped Xiao Yu’s face!

With this slap, a clear palm print appeared on Xiao Yu’s face!

Meanwhile, Qin Yu clenched his fist in an instant!

“Qin Yu killed my father. I’m planning to take revenge on him,” Yan Haoran said coldly.

“Since you’re his friend, you’ll suffer for him first.”

After saying that, Yan Haoran looked at Jing Shihong and said, “I’ll leave it to you.”

Jing Shihong licked his lips and said with a lecherous look, “Young Master Yan, I don’t have any other hobbies. I’m just interested in women. You see...”

“Do as you wish,” Yan Haoran said coldly.

Jing Shihong was overjoyed when he heard that!

He licked his lips and said, “Little devil, let me settle the account with you.”

“I can help too,” Bi Guocang said shamelessly.

“Let go of me!” Xiao Yu panicked and struggled desperately.

However, she was just a beginner in cultivation, so how could she be a match for two peak-stage Inner Strength Grandmasters?

“Stop!”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly shouted!

Everyone turned to look at Qin Yu.

“Are you crazy? Why are you suddenly shouting?” Jing Shihong said unhappily.

Bi Guocang, who was beside him, also glared at him and said, “Don’t delay us from doing our business!”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and braced himself to say, “Since this little devil relies on dark energy to cultivate, she must be useful to us.”

After saying that, Qin Yu pointed at the huge pit and said, “Why don’t I go down with her and explore the treasures below?”

Jing Shihong said impatiently, “Cut the crap and wait until I’m done!”

Qin Yu hurriedly grabbed Jing Shihong’s arm and said anxiously, “No!”

Jing Shihong looked at his arm and then looked at Qin Yu coldly while saying, “Do you want to die?”

Qin Yu suppressed the anger inside and said, “According to my understanding, this girl probably has a pure dark energy body.”

“This kind of physique is very attractive to any kind of dark energy.”

“And the treasures buried in this huge pit is definitely a treasure of dark energy. It’s perfect to use her to activate this treasure!”

“Once she loses her virginity, the allure of her pure dark energy body will be greatly reduced!”

Qin Yu’s words immediately made the crowd quiet down.

“This kid is right,” someone next to him nodded.

“The pure dark energy body’s virginity is indeed attractive to dark energy objects.”

“Why don’t we do as he says?”

Hearing the crowd’s words, Qin Yu immediately heaved a sigh of relief.

Jing Shihong was naturally very displeased that his plan was thwarted by Qin Yu.

He looked at Yan Haoran with an embarrassed smile and said, “Young Master Yan, I’m already ready. Why don’t... you let me have her for a while before letting her go down?”

Yan Haoran glanced at Jing Shihong coldly and said, “Do you think with your lower body? If you can’t distinguish between priorities like this, then you’re unsuitable to serve the Yan family.”

Jing Shihong’s expression suddenly changed.

He hurriedly waved his hand and said, “Young Master Yan, I know I’m wrong...”

Yan Haoran ignored Jing Shihong and looked at Qin Yu while asking in a cold voice, “Why are you telling us this?”

“That’s right! We treated you as a tool, but you told us all this. It doesn’t make sense,” Jing Shihong added.

Qin Yu’s expression turned a little ugly.
