1828 The Origin of the Guardian

This outcome was beyond Qin Yu’s expectations.

Especially after hearing the peak master’s words, Qin Yu felt even more strange.

Seeing that Qin Yu was silent, the dean said indifferently, “Why? You’re not happy?”

“No,” Qin Yu shook his head and said. “I just felt that it’s a little strange.

“I haven’t had any outstanding performance since I came to Thunder Courtyard. I also haven’t made any significant contributions.

!!

“But why are you so concerned about me? You’re even willing to break the rules for me?”

Upon hearing this, Dean Lei laughed.

He clasped his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “It’s because I know your father, and we’re old friends.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu was shocked instantly!

He hurriedly walked up to the dean and said excitedly, “Dean, you… You know my father, do you? What’s your relationship with him? How did you know him?”

The series of questions made the dean smile even more widely.

“You don’t need to know so much,” he said indifferently. “You just need to know your father and I are old friends.”

Qin Yu’s face was full of shock.

As expected, his father had also come to Holy Region!

However, how did her father, who had always been mysterious, develop a relationship with Dean Lei?

What was the relationship between them that it had made Dean Lei take such good care of him?

“Dean, do you know where my father is? What is his identity?” Qin Yu asked.

“He’s a Guardian, don’t you know?” the dean said indifferently.

Guardian!

The dean even knew about Guardian!

After all, his father was not from Holy Region but from Earth!

Could it be that the so-called Guardian was not the Guardian from Earth? Instead, he was the Guardian of the universe’s Path of Heaven.

It was so unimaginable!

“Alright. Don’t ask so much. It’s best not to let too many people know your father is a Guardian,” Dean Lei waved his hand, shook his head, and said.

Although Qin Yu still had endless doubts in his heart, the dean obviously didn’t want to answer too many questions.

In the face of Qin Yu’s question, the dean only smiled and said nothing.

“Go and cultivate. You only need to know your bloodline power is not weaker than anyone else’s,” the dean said.

As soon as he said that, Qin Yu seemed to be reignited with hope in his heart.

Compared to Si Shiyue, Qin Yu’s bloodline had always been a weak point. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

But now, it seemed that this weakness had been wiped out.

“Dean, the most powerful bloodline power comes from an Immortal Emperor. Could it be that my father is an Immortal Emperor?” Qin Yu said in shock.

“Hahaha!” As soon as he said that, Dean Lei burst into laughter.

He shook his head and said, “Of course, your father isn’t an Immortal Emperor. If he were, it’s out of the dao technique. How could he be the Guardian?”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and said, ” But if that’s the case, there are many powerful bloodline inheritors of the Immortal Emperor in this world. How can I be comparable with them?”

“Compared to the first-generation Immortal Emperor bloodline inheritor, you are naturally weaker. But where can we find a first-generation Immortal Emperor bloodline inheritor in this world?” Dean Lei said.

“Even the most powerful inheritors of bloodline awakening are not comparable with the first generation. The same goes for those kids from aristocratic families in Zhongzhou.

“Although their bloodlines are strong, they’re not comparable to the first-generation bloodline inheritors.”

Qin Yu finally understood.

Although both Si Shiyue and Yan Ruoxue were awakeners of powerful bloodlines, no matter how complete their awakenings were, they’re not comparable to the first generation.”

“I understand now.” Qin Yu bowed slightly as if he had understood something.

“Thank you, Dean Lei. Then I’ll have to trouble you to take me to the Immortal Graveyard,” Qin Yu continued.

“Are you going now?” Dean Lei asked in surprise.

“I don’t want to waste a single minute,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“Hahaha! I’ve seen strong will in you many times. I believe in the future, your strength will definitely be above your father’s!” Dean Lei laughed heartily and said.

“Thank you, Dean,” Qin Yu bowed and said.

After that, Dean Lei did not waste time. With a wave of his hand, the surrounding space began to distort forcefully!

Such a technique made Qin Yu turn pale with fright!

The surrounding space distorted non-stop, and both of them seemed to have stepped into another world.

It was pitch black in the surroundings, and they couldn’t see the end of it.

After some time, a glimmer of light appeared in front of them.

This light was like an entrance, an entrance to a Mystic Realm.

Qin Yu had never seen such a Mystic Realm before!

Dean Lei brought Qin Yu through the entrance and entered a Mystic Realm!

In front of them was a vast expanse of white, incomparably divine!

As far as the eye could see, one could see a pointed end piercing through the clouds. A mysterious internal qi and dark energy converged. The dao of the Immortal Emperor was extremely rich here.

Qin Yu took a deep breath. In such an environment, Qin Yu seemed close to the dao technique. It was extremely mysterious!

“This…”

Qin Yu’s mouth was wide open!

What kind of back door did the dean open for Qin Yu, so that he could listen to the Immortal Emperor’s dao at a close distance?

Compared to this place, Demon-slaying Peak was not worth mentioning!

It was simply a Holy Land of Cultivation! Probably even the children of the aristocratic families in Zhongzhou could not compare!

“Other than inheritors like Si Shiyue and Yan Ruoxue, the children of the aristocratic families are far inferior to me,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He suppressed the excitement in his heart and gave the dean a deep bow.

“Thank you, Dean. I will never forget your great kindness,” Qin Yu said sincerely.

The dean reached out his hand and drew a circle in front of Qin Yu.

The circle was like an impassable barrier, and Qin Yu could not take half a step forward.

“You can only cultivate within this circle. You can’t leave even half a step. Otherwise, a wisp of internal qi from the immortal grave will destroy your soul,” the dean said.

“I understand, Dean,” Qin Yu nodded and said.

The dead stroked his beard and said with a smile, “You can cultivate here. If you have an opportunity to meet your father, please send my regards to him.”

“I will,” Qin Yu said.

“By the way, Dean, I need your help.” Qin Yu suddenly remembered something.

The dean nodded slightly, signaling Qin Yu to continue.

“Someone wants to kill Jue Wu and me,” Qin Yu said in a low voice. “While I’m not around, please take care of Jue Wu, and don’t let her leave Demon-slaying Peak.”

“Hahaha!” Hearing this, the director laughed.

He clasped his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “To be honest, I intend to take her as my disciple. Of course, it’s not because of you. It’s just that I really like this little girl. Of course, it’s not now.”

Qin Yu was overjoyed when he heard that!

If the dean took her as his disciple, Jue Wu would definitely be able to display her talent to the extreme!
