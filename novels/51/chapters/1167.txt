Chapter 1168: Chapter 1,168, the power of blood 

The people around were all shocked!

This crude and simple method actually had a miraculous effect!

“Qin Yu, you damn bastard!”Gu Xinghe roared angrily.

“This time, I won’t give you any more chances. I’ll definitely kill you at the first opportunity!”

Before Qin Yu could speak, Su Qi said in a deep voice, “Be careful, this Qin Yu seems to be a little different. I suspect... he has already absorbed Yan Ruoxue’s blood.”

“So what!”Gu Xinghe did not care at all.

In his opinion, cultivation level was everything!

Even if Qin Yu had absorbed the blood, he was only at the middle stage of the Martial Saint Realm. How could he be a match for someone at the Almighty Realm?

“Kid, I’m going to tear you into pieces!”

Gu Xinghe raised his head and let out a furious roar. The Aura of an almighty had erupted from his internal Qi!

A strong gust of wind rose from under his feet, and the ground collapsed at this moment!

Countless people were forced back by this shout. It was as if even the dark clouds in the sky had dissipated at this moment.

Only Qin Yu stood there like a rock, not moving at all.

Qin Yu’s body trembled slightly, and his body was covered with a layer of golden light. The green wood true body also appeared.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s body had already reached an extremely terrifying state. The clothes on his body were shattered, revealing his body that was like Jade.

“I’m going to kill you!”

Gu Xinghe shouted and suddenly clenched his fist and rushed towards Qin Yu!

It was obvious that Gu Xinghe intended to fight Qin Yu with his body! He wanted to use Qin Yu’s most dazzling body to defeat Qin Yu!

Qin Yu stood there extremely calmly. Looking at Gu Xinghe’s fist that was shooting towards him, he immediately clenched his fist and raised his hand. His expression did not change as he welcomed it.

“Clang!”

The sound of metal colliding could be heard! Gu Xinghe only felt a huge force spread on his fist. The bones of his fist were almost shattered!

The force spread from his fist to his entire arm!

“Deng Deng Deng!”

In the next second, Gu Xinghe was forced back three steps by this huge force!

Silence!

The scene was completely silent!

When Yao Meng and the others saw the scene in front of them, they could not help but feel that their throats were dry!

Qin Yu... was actually this powerful?

“Could it be that he has already stepped into the Almighty Realm?”Someone exclaimed.

“That’s not right! His realm has not improved at all!”

“Intermediate stage of the Martial Saint Realm? He’s already so terrifying even though he’s only at the intermediate stage of the Martial Saint Realm?”

At this moment, almost no one dared to believe it! Even Yao Meng, Xiao Yuan, and the others felt that it was unbelievable!

“Damn, it still has to be Mr. Qin!”Yao Qing could not help but say excitedly from the side.

Qin Yu looked at Gu Xinghe coldly, and almost no expression could be seen on his face.

“You’re not worthy to fight with my physical body,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Gu Xinghe’s expression was somewhat embarrassed. He spat out a mouthful of fresh blood on the ground and said coldly, “It was just a mistake just now. The current me has the body of a mighty figure!”

Qin Yu sneered, “So what if I have the body of a mighty figure?”

Qin Yu’s physical body was originally not weaker than that of a mighty figure. Now that he had absorbed Yan Ruoxue’s blood, Qin Yu’s physical body had improved even further. Whether it was strength, speed, or even spiritual power, they had all reached an extremely abnormal state!

“I’ll give you another chance.”Qin Yu stood there and looked at Gu Xinghe coldly.

Gu Xinghe was still unwilling to give up. He did not believe that his physical body could not be compared to Qin Yu’s.

“President Gu, it’s best to be careful. Yan Yongfu had said long ago that once Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue Combine, they can not be measured by common sense,”Su Qi reminded him.

Gu Xinghe roared, “F * ck it, I don’t believe it!”

Gu Xinghe, who was unwilling to give up, rushed towards Qin Yu once again!

He used both his hands and feet, and his fists rained down on Qin Yu!

Qin Yu appeared to be quite relaxed. He raised his palm and received almost every punch from Gu Xinghe.

Gu Xinghe’s eyes flashed with a hint of coldness. He reached out his hand and slapped at Qin Yu. Just as his palm was about to land on Qin Yu’s body, a mark quickly formed on his palm!

This was the terrifying aspect of mighty figures. Spells and marks could be condensed at an extremely fast speed! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Qin Yu could not react in time. The Mark pressed down on Qin Yu’s body with a bang!

Like a grenade exploding in front of his chest, the terrifying force directly sent Qin Yu flying and smashed the Divine Alchemist pavilion into ruins!

“Hahahaha!”Seeing this, Gu Xinghe could not help but laugh out loud.

“Fool, do you really think that I will fight you to the end with my physical body?”

“Gu Xinghe, you are really shameless! You are a mighty martial saint, yet you still want to play dirty!”Zhuang Teng could not help but curse.

Gu Xinghe sneered, “This is my ability. If you are not convinced, then come and take revenge for him.”

Zhuang Teng was instantly speechless and retreated to the side resentfully.

“Su Qi, go and bring him out for me,”Gu Xinghe said indifferently.

Su Qi could not help but frown, “That Qin Yu might not be dead. I... I don’t think it’s appropriate for me to go.”

Gu Xinghe’s expression could not help but turn cold as he said, “If you dare to say such disheartening words again, I’ll kill you immediately!”

Su Qi’s brows instantly furrowed. Under Gu Xinghe’s coercion, she could only rush towards Qin Yu’s direction.

However, before she could get close, a ray of light had already erupted from the ruins!

Following that, Qin Yu, who was half-naked, burst out from the ruins!

His body was still as good as jade, not even a single white scar was left!
