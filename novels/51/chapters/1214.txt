Chapter 1215: Chapter 1,215 was used up! 

The ninth bottle, the tenth bottle, was injected into Qin Yu’s body.

As the tenth bottle ended, that Professor Chicken became even crazier!

He couldn’t believe that someone could withstand the weight of ten bottles and didn’t seem to have any intention of stopping!

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu had already endured a total of fifteen bottles.

When it was the sixteenth bottle, professor chicken stopped what he was doing.

His eyes lit up and his palms trembled slightly as he looked around in panic.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Why did you stop? Didn’t I say not to stop until I say so?”

Professor chicken said, “I don’t want to stop either, but we don’t have any more strengthening agents.”

“Are you done?”Qin Yu sat up from the bed.

Professor chicken hummed and said, “I didn’t expect you to be able to withstand so many strengthening agents. How Do You Feel Now?”

Qin Yu gently clenched his fist and said, “It is indeed effective. Compared to before, my physical body should be four to six times stronger.”

Four to six times was an extremely abnormal number for Qin Yu’s body!

His body was already invincible to begin with, but now, he was six times stronger. What kind of concept was that! !

Not to mention ordinary mighty figures, even peak mighty figures would probably not be able to compare!

The eighteen people beside him seemed to feel somewhat regretful, because they had yet to experience this strengthening agent.

“Speaking of which, where did you get this strengthening agent?”Qin Yu stood up and asked as he paced around.

Professor Chicken did not hide anything. He pointed at the vast sea outside the laboratory and said, “It’s condensed from the blood taken from the bodies of the creatures in the sea.”

“From the sea? That’s a Demon Beast.”Qin Yu thought to himself.

It seemed like Qin Yu’s guess was correct.

This so-called strengthening agent was on the same principle as the beast blood recorded in the book, which was used to enhance the potential and even the body.

“This kind of creature is very rare. We have been here for three years and tested hundreds of marine creatures, but none of them had such an effect. Only that one,”said professor chicken.

Qin Yu asked, “Do you have a picture of that creature?”

Professor chicken hummed and said, “Yes.”

Then, he ordered the people around him to rummage through the cabinets and took out a picture.

Qin Yu took the picture.

There was a fiery-red demonic beast on the picture.

The Demonic Beast’s body was fiery-red, and its appearance was somewhat similar to that of a chicken.

Feathers stood up on its body, but these feathers flickered with a cold light and were extremely sharp. They were enough to easily cut through steel and even mountains.

Its beak reflected the radiance of the sea. It looked as bright as silver, and its sturdiness was probably beyond imagination.

“A cub?”Qin Yu frowned.

Professor chicken nodded and said, “That’s right. We speculate that it’s also a cub.”

Qin Yu didn’t know what kind of demon beast it was, and so did professor chicken and the others.

However, it looked like a chicken, so it was named Sea Chicken.

Although it was quite similar to a chicken, compared to a chicken, it was more beautiful and enchanting.

“Aren’t you afraid that the parents of this sea chicken will find you and kill you?”Qin Yu asked casually.

Professor chicken shook his head and said, “We have already obtained this sea chicken for a whole month. There are no parents. Besides, even if there are, we are not afraid because we have the most sophisticated military equipment. Even if it is a monster, we can blast it into pieces.”

Qin Yu could not help but laugh, “Are you talking about the ones placed at the door?”

“That’s right. These are donated by Western countries. They are extremely powerful.”Professor chicken was slightly proud.

Qin Yu, however, remained silent.

These professors had obviously underestimated the power of adult demon beasts.

Such demon beasts were definitely not something that ordinary military equipment could injure.

“Where’s the corpse of that sea chicken cub?”Qin Yu asked.

Professor chicken replied, “It’s in the warehouse.”

Qin Yu immediately followed Professor Chicken and entered the warehouse.

Opening the door of the warehouse, a pungent smell of blood assailed his nostrils. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

In the huge warehouse, there were hundreds of Demon Beasts’corpses. Each of them had scars left by the cannon fire.

Seeing such a cruel scene, Qin Yu couldn’t bear it.

Professor chicken seemed to have seen through Qin Yu’s thoughts, he pointed at the corpses and said, “These beasts took the initiative to attack us. Back then, we brought an entire team of 100 people. Now, there are only seven of US left.”

Qin Yu came to a sudden realization and nodded, “I see.”

Professor chicken snorted and said, “These beasts ran rampant in this sea area and killed countless people. Fortunately, there were donations from various countries. Otherwise, we would have died here.”

Qin Yu walked into the warehouse and found the sea chicken.

This sea chicken was actually the size of a huge rock!

And such a huge body was actually just a cub.

Qin Yu walked forward and caressed his corpse.

As expected, the feathers on the sea chicken’s body were like steel blades, and its beak was extremely hard.

One had to know that this was just a cub and had yet to grow. Otherwise, who knew how hard the body of this thing would be.

“We plan to use this corpse to continue attracting his kind,”said professor chicken.

Qin Yu frowned, “No, with your equipment, you are no match for them.”

Professor chicken sneered, “Then where did the corpse in the warehouse come from? This sea chicken is just a beast after all. In front of our fine military equipment, it is not worth mentioning.”

After saying that, professor chicken ordered his men to drag the sea chicken’s corpse out and throw it on the beach.

Qin Yu did not want to get involved in this matter, but this item could indeed improve one’s physical body. In addition, the other 18 people had not yet undergone the strengthening agent, so Qin Yu temporarily stayed behind.
