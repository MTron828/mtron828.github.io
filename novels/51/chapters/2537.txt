2538 Extortion Before Leaving

However, no matter how he called out, Immortal Emperor Yao did not respond even if he opened the coffin lid.

It could not see through all the changes like previously. It probably required the power of the Primordial Chaos for the desolate divine eye to undergo another change.

After a while, Qin Yu closed the desolate divine eye. He was leaving tomorrow, and it was too late to experiment now. Moreover, he had to go to the Misty Forest in excellent condition.

“I hope this old man won’t trick me…”

Qin Yu thought with a bitter smile. How could the will of an Immortal Emperor be so easy to control?

Every step must have its will planning.

Tracing it back, the decline of the Yao family was directly related to Qin Yu. He had killed the Yao family’s Holy Son and other important people of the bloodline.

Qin Yu would rather believe that he was the First Emperor than say Immortal Emperor Yao would help him wholeheartedly.

He just hoped that before they reached the same goal, Immortal Emperor Yao would try his best to help him.

…

At this moment, in a dimly lit room in purgatory in Solitary Cloud City…

A group of people sat quietly in the room. These people were the disciples of the three sects who had come to look for Qin Yu today.

“Senior Brother Xuan Xin, aren’t you being too generous with the item you’ve promised? Even in our three sects, there are only two pieces of Heavenly Soul Jades. If you give one piece to Qin Yu, how are you going to explain it upon return to the sect?”

Shen Rou said. She was also one of the six people from the Divine Will Sect yesterday and was a sister to Shen Qian.

Hearing what she said, everyone stared at Xuan Xin, seemingly puzzled.

“This is the most important matter for the three sects. Moreover, it is such a good opportunity that the three sects can restart this mission. However, this mission is not going to be simple. Even if the three sect masters have asked Lord Xinghe of the Sacred Sect to deduce, there has been another change in the Misty Forest. All the heavenly secrets have been concealed by the mist.”

Xuan Xin said softly, and everyone was instantly shocked.

If even the Saint Su Xinghe couldn’t predict their fortunes or misfortunes, so what unforeseen events might arise on this journey?

“Lord Su Xinghe used the Qi Observing Technique to look out again. The dark power of the monster race is like a blazing flame burning fiercely, and the world is toppling over. On the contrary, our human race is completely dark in this area, but there is a wisp of fate energy flickering in the wind, making Master tell me that I might consider moving forward with him on this trip.”

“Is that Qin Yu?”

Xuan Xin nodded and sighed.

Amidst the dim light, the atmosphere among the people was tremendously solemn.

Even if he was the person appointed by Saint Su Xinghe, his cosmic luck was just a candle in the wind. Could they leave safely?

Early the following morning, Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes.

The space before him was suddenly full of ripples. He stood up and entered the space the Primordial Sky Concealing Mirror covered.

“It seems that you’ve decided to go with us. Let’s set off. Please take note try not to use the power of spiritual energy before entering the Misty Forest. After entering the Misty Forest, avoiding a bloody battle will definitely be difficult. At that time, we will unleash all our strength and end the battle as quickly as possible.”

Li Yang reminded.

“Understood.”

Qin Yu nodded. Under the protection of the precious light of the Primordial Sky Concealing Mirror, he headed toward the Misty Forest.

An extreme chill rose from everyone’s body as they approached the forest.

The chill seemed to have pierced deep into their bones. Even their nursing spiritual energy could not resist it.

“What a terrifying dark power! Other than the ancient battlefield, this place might be one of the places where the greatest number of living beings have perished.”

Xuan Tian from the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect also looked a little unnatural. Only after entering did he realize how terrifying it was.

Even from the periphery, one could hear the roars of countless monsters.

There were twisted trees, bones, and creatures that had been twisted by the dark power along the way.

The demonic roars, wails, and howls echoed in the valley from time to time.

Moreover, even though they were all living beings in the monster territory, they could almost see terrifying battles everywhere along the way.

These monster beasts were cruel and bloodthirst and possessed formidable dark powers and evil techniques.

It was even more shocking that a fourth-level monster dragon was crazily casting spells.

Countless dark tentacles extended out from the void and tied a Giant Titan firmly on the spot.

It then let out a heaven-shaking roar and spat a terrifying dragon breath onto the Titan’s head, killing it utterly.

“What a terrifying power! With the monster race body and the dark technique, even an ordinary human race cultivator of the fifth level would find it hard to fight against this monster dragon!”

Qin Yu’s expression was incomparably shocked.

Usually, the dark monster beasts would fight with the physical body just like the monster race army.

However, along the way, at this moment, he could see some monster beast races that could unleash the techniques of the Path of Heaven. Moreover, they were tremendously powerful.

For those whose physical body cultivation was weak, these monster beasts could really kill them.

“The dark power in this Misty Forest is sometimes strong and sometimes weak. However, in these two years of the Path of Heaven, as the power of the monster race’s Path of Heaven became increasingly stronger, the power of the Dark Path of Heaven here also became increasingly richer. The monster race living beings living here also gained the power. During the great war some time ago, the monster beasts that came out of this area also caused great damage to the human race.”

Shen Rou of the Divine Will Sect explained this to Qin Yu.

“Moreover, as time passed, and in recent years, the secrets of the heavens in this Misty Forest have been concealed, and even the Saints can’t deduce the changes within. With the Way of Nurturing Parasite in this Misty Forest and such terrifying dark power, it was likely that an existence that even the Saints feared would be born. Lord Xinghe is unable to deduce the variables in this trip. It is likely to be extremely dangerous…”

“Are you stupid? Why did you explain it to him so clearly?”

Zhang Xiang covered his head with one hand and tried to explain himself. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Lord Xinghe has also said that as long as we work together and overcome the difficulties together, we will definitely be able to overcome the obstacles and reach the shore of success.”

It would have been better if he did not explain. Qin Yu was speechless.

It was indeed a f*cking trap and a huge one.

The fact that the sect leaders of the three sects had requested Su Xinghe’s divination for this task indicated that it was undoubtedly a massive and earth-shattering mission.

Qin Yu felt like crying but without tears. He felt like he had boarded a pirate ship.
