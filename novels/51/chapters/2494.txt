2495 Heavenly Profound Power

In the land of the demon race at this point, traces of the source of poison slowly spread from the depths to the entire Azure Rock Forest.

The rest was beyond his ability and could not be dealt with.

In an instant, the poison permeated the water vapor in the air and also hid in the river.

After countless demon-race living beings breathed, they were unknowingly injected with a trace of poison.

In the Azure Rock Forest, millions of ordinary demon race living beings died tragically in an instant.

Those with profound cultivation also suddenly realized their cultivation seemed to have been blocked, and even their life force was weakened.

Immortal Crane’s expression was hideous.

Under his divine thought, the impact of the remaining source on Azure Rock Forest had been absorbed into the divine sea.

The inexplicable cosmic luck of the demon race in the Path of Heaven seemed to have dimmed slightly.

“How is it? The source of poison I’ve collected for nearly 5,000 years didn’t disappoint you, right?

“During war, there is always a price to pay. The demon race can’t always have the upper hand.”

After Immortal Crane closed his eyes, he regained his calm.

The battle between the demon race and the Holy Region, regardless of their sneak attacks on the Ni or the Gu family.

Even when they plotted against Yan Tianfeng, the demon race had achieved overwhelming victory.

“Is this the power of the Heart of the Ocean? Even if your soul shatters, you can still hold on for so long?”

Immortal Crane looked at the Heart of the Ocean carefully. He was curious about this mysterious celestial artifact.

Gu Ning did not respond.

During the incredibly speedy escape in water, the Heart of the Ocean flew toward the locations of Xiao Sheng and Teng Zixu. A drop of water segregated from the Heart of the Ocean.

It then turned into hundreds of tiny droplets of water vapor, and the water vapors turned into a sword shooting forward at an even more terrifying speed.

“Xiao Sheng, retreat.”

As if sensing Immortal Crane approaching Teng Zixu, Revered Qi’s figure arrived instantly.

Although it was not as strong as the true body, he still had close to 70% of the power of the true body, which was enough to fight Teng Zixu.

This method was somewhat similar to the projection of the Path of Heaven of the evil exterminator.

When it came to Immortal Crane, they were all staring at the higher-ups. As soon as he approached Teng Zixu, Revered Qi could sense him immediately.

Of course, if he appeared in the human world, Revered Qi would notice him almost immediately.

This was also the reason why he did not make a move on the Gu family’s battlefield. Soldiers were against soldiers and generals against generals. If he made a move, Revered Qi would do the same.

“Boom!”

Teng Zixu and Xiao Sheng exchanged another blow and then separated.

This time, Teng Zixu’s injuries seemed even more severe, and he was at a disadvantage in the battle with Xiao Sheng.

Xiao Sheng’s comprehension of the power of heaven and earth had indeed improved immensely.

As the water arrows flew, they arrived in an instant.

However, it was not in the direction of Xiao Sheng.

Instead, it directly charged toward Teng Zixu. The power of the poison caused Teng Zixu’s expression to change drastically.

A magnificent saber light slashed out, instantly shattering the thousands of water arrows.

However, the mist was like maggots in the bones, crawling along the saber energy to the blade.

“How dare you! Gu Ning!”

Revered Qi was furious, and his palm pressed down.

However, it was suddenly blocked in the air by Immortal Crane.

“Revered Qi, just watch in peace.”

Immortal Crane was also surprised. He did not understand why Gu Ning would choose Teng Zixu.

But as long as it was not against Xiao Sheng, he did not care.

If the Son of Cosmic Luck of the human race could die here, he would be even more happy to see it.

“Gu Ning, do you really want to betray the human race? If you dare to make a move, I will definitely kill all the descendants of your Gu family.”

Revered Qi let out an angry roar. He did not expect Gu Ning’s target to be Teng Zixu.

Gu Ning’s cold voice was emotionless.

The outermost gem of the Heart of the Ocean melted, and the dark blue power rolled like clouds.

It then condensed into a palm and pressed toward Teng Zixu’s chest.

“You think you can kill me?”

Teng Zixu’s expression was incomparably indifferent.

Resonance of Fate!

The thunder in the sky surged as the terrifying saber light slashed out.

Sharp thunderous sounds filled the entire world with dreadful saber energy.

Under this saber strike, it directly triggered the resonance of the Path of Heaven.

“Boom!”

The power unleashed from the Heart of the Ocean seemed to cut into countless water vapor in front of this saber.

However, the next moment, countless water vapor appeared in front of Teng Zixu again. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Those fine bubbles gathered into a dark palm and pierced through Teng Zixu.

“You’re not worthy of being the Son of Cosmic Luck of the human race.”

A cold voice sounded beside Teng Zixu’s ears.

As the black palm pierced through, it seemed to carry a strange power.

The Heart of the Ocean emitted a bright blue light and directly escaped.

Teng Zixu frowned slightly without noticing the injuries on his body.

However, he clearly felt that he had lost some power.

In an instant, his connection with the Path of Heaven seemed to have weakened a little.

Revered Qi let out a tremendously furious roar in the air. Gu Ning’s power could no longer kill Teng Zixu.

Her objective was to grab Teng Zixu’s chosen one’s profound power of the origin, even though it was only about one-tenth of it.

However, the impact on Teng Zixu was tremendous. He had lost a portion of his perfectly chosen one’s origin.

His perception of the Path of Heaven would definitely be affected, which meant Teng Zixu’s cultivation speed would slow down in the future.

“Hahaha! I didn’t expect the human race to break the perfect body of the chosen one of the human race. This is good news!”

Immortal Crane laughed loudly. Gu Ning was dead, and the perfect body of the chosen one was broken.

This was bound to be another significant blow to the human race.

At this moment, on the other end, the power of the blue energy suddenly entered Qin Yu’s body.

The Heart of the Ocean suddenly appeared in Qin Yu’s body. At this moment, the blue light of the Heart of the Ocean was very dim as if it had exhausted its strength. A weak divine sense sounded in his sea of consciousness.

“Qin Yu, a vast number of members of the Gu family were killed by the demon race. This time, I entered the demon race to do two things. The first is to throw the source of poison into the demon race’s water source. Although Immortal Crane can reverse it with heaven-defying methods, it has brought immense pollution to the demon race’s living place. A vast number of demon race living beings will be affected by the source of poison.”

Qin Yu was quiet when he heard Gu Ning’s voice. Even now, there were still many things that he could not understand.
