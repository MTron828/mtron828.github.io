Chapter 2803: One Thought Reincarnation

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

A pair of eyes slowly opened. It was Qin Yu’s Nine Heavens Manifestations

Gaze.

“Be careful!”

As the eye opened, everyone’s expression turned grave.

They were all prepared for the terrifying power of the eye of hell to descend, but nothing happened this time.

The power of reincarnation flickered in his eyes. In an instant, everyone’s bodies froze.

It was as if they were in another space. The Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze was like the moon, shining in the sky.

Countless scenes seemed to appear in the eye.

Past life, present life, and future.

Countless scenes had a thousand threads of connection with them.

One Thought Reincarnation!

Qin Yu’s Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze suddenly closed.

The scenes of countless reincarnations suddenly merged.

The past, the present, the future, and thousands of other scenes were crushed together like a millstone.

In an instant, the color drained from the faces of the dozens of people present. At the moment, their pupils lost all their consciousness.

Rakshasa held the “Suppression” talisman in his hand, but he didn’t even have the chance to use it.

Ding!

A saber shadow suddenly descended. The saber light cut the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze in half.

Before the remaining energy was exhausted, it split Qin Yu’s body into two.

At this moment, the power of the blade light suddenly erupted.

A young man slowly appeared in the hazy sand.

Swordsman Ye Kai was one of the Situ family’s guest elders.

He was one of the top ten swordsmen in the Saint World.

In order to make him stay, the Situ family had given him a Dragon Abyss and invited a Swordsman who had been in seclusion for many years.

They made an appointment with Ye Kai in the name of this person. When Ye

Kai could cut through his saber momentum, the karma between him and the Situ family would be completely resolved. At that time, the Situ family would not stop him from leaving.

Divine Doctor Lu’s heart trembled. That attack had made Ye Kai feel threatened, thus he attacked.

Ye Kai’s strength was already extremely close to that of a Holy Consciousness.

If the family didn’t borrow the power of the Treasure Continent, they would probably lose to him.

“If this continues, I’m afraid we won’t be able to suppress him for long!”

Divine Doctor Lu felt a chill run down his spine.

Qin Yu’s transformation made him feel a fatal crisis.

It had only been a short while, yet Qin Yu had become so difficult to deal with.

If time dragged on, what would happen to Qin Yu?

With the Situ family’s strength, could they continue to suppress him?

Qin Yu’s body suddenly stretched out countless tentacles at the edge of his blade. The tentacles that filled the sky were like poisonous snakes surrounding

Ye Kai.

The Earth Blade wrapped in cloth stood up and Ye Kai slashed down with one hand.

Those tentacles split apart one after another.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

When Ye Kai looked at Qin Yu again, his body had disappeared.

Qin Yu was almost invincible with the power of the Dao of Dreams and the Investiture of Gods.

He seemed to be able to handle this top-notch swordsman with ease.

Divine Doctor Lu’s body flashed and he left the place once again.

“It’s fine. This seems to be the power of the Nineteenth Prison, not the internal qi of the Investiture of Gods. However, with the help of the Investiture of Gods, his power of the Dao of Dreams seems to have improved by leaps and bounds. This is indeed a little creepy. Anyway, doesn’t this mean what we’re doing is right?”

Situ Qianxun shook his head as if he already knew why Divine Doctor Lu was there.

His hair was a little messy.

That power made them obsessed, but they were also terrified.

Especially when they used it yesterday, it seemed that some kind of huge power had sensed them.

If Situ Qianxun hadn’t cut off the power of the Investiture of Gods in time, something terrible might have happened.

No one had the chance to resist it.

One had to know that this was where the Situ family gathered almost all of their resources. One could imagine how terrifying the strength of this group of people was.

Even Holy Lords would have to think twice before facing this power.

“Patriarch Qianxun, I feel like we’re playing with fire. Forgive me for being blunt, but with the Situ family’s foundation, we can’t use this power at all. It may be a bottomless abyss after the step.”

Divine Doctor Lu said with a bitter smile.

He had been there yesterday and that suffocating feeling was unforgettable. He had been in the Saint World for so long but he had never felt so helpless before.

“There’s another thing. You have to pay attention to the Young Lord’s movements. He took something he shouldn’t have taken from the family’s important place. I didn’t stop him. The decision right should be on you.”

“I know. This is worrying.”

Situ Qianxun knocked on his head.

While they were chatting, a dagger suddenly appeared in front of Situ Qianxun.

A dagger slashed out a one-meter-long mark. The power was like a wave of water that shook irregularly.

Then, it landed on Situ Qianxun’s body. However, the force could not get close to him at all.

It was as if there was a layer of invisible power blocking him.

Fatty Situ’s fat body appeared from the crack.

His eyes were bloodshot as he stared at Situ Qianxun.

“I said, I want the incomplete page of the Investiture of Gods!”

Fatty Situ said word by word.

“Who do you think you are? I’ve been enduring you these days, hoping you would wake up from your ridiculous emotions in time. I didn’t expect that you would dare to lay your cards on the table with me today.”

Situ Qianxun burst into laughter. Divine Doctor Lu furrowed his brows. He had never seen Situ Qianxun in such an emotional state before.

Sigh! Supernatural.

“This is what I owe him. I also risked my life to obtain this Investiture of Gods. Is it unworthy to use this power that doesn’t belong to us in exchange for a brother? If he can use the power of the Investiture of Gods, our Situ family won’t have to take the risk of using this power either!”

Fatty Situ clenched his fists tightly.

“Get lost! If you’re not part of the family, you won’t even be worth a dog. How dare you want to take this thing!”

Situ Qianxun threw out a palm and pulled Fatty Situ into the air.

This power!

Divine Doctor Lu’s eyes widened in shock. The three silver needles stared at the space like swimming dragons.

With a wave of his right hand, he pulled Fatty Situ out.

“Just give up. All your preparations have already been reported to PatriarchSitu

Qianxun. You can’t save Qin Yu. Moreover, even if you get the Investiture of Gods, there’s a high chance that it won’t be of any use.”

Divine Doctor Lu said in a weak voice.

Situ Qianxun had already made up his mind.

If the Situ family could master the power, they would probably not only be the wealthiest clan, but their strength would also be comparable to the Alester family..
