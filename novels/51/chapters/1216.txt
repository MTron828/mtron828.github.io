Chapter 1217: Chapter 1,217, the means of summoning demonic beasts 

The other party agreed and said, “Of co. As far as I know, this kind of array flag has appeared in Luhuang Island recently.”

“Luhuang Island? where is that?”Qin Yu frowned and asked.

The other party was somewhat surprised and said, “Don’t yoow about Luhuang Island? That used to be the largest underground trading market in the world.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He had never heard of this Luhuang Island.

Qin Yew a lot about the underground trading market.

It was said that in that place, anything could be bought and sold, including life.

Many top cases were completed in the underground trading market.

“Help me keep an eye on this array flag. No matter how much it costs, I will get my hands on it,”Qin Yid in a deep voice.

“This... I’m afraid I can’t guarantee it,”the other party said with some embarrassment.

“Mr. Qin, you’d better come here early to prevent this item from being taken away by others.”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment and said, “I can’t go there now. It’ll take me at least five days.”

Even if Qin Yu rushed back now, it would take him four whole days to arrive.

The other party thought for a moment and said, “How about this? I will go to Deer Emperor Island now and try to help yoep this item. But I can’t guarantee whether it will succeed or not.”

“Okay, thank you. I will do it as soon as possible,”Qin Yid.

“This is what I should do,”the other party said with a smile.

After the conversation, they learned that this person’s name was Di Zun, and he was only in his twenties.

The two of them didn’t chat anymore. After discng, they hung up the phone.

This phone call couldn’t help but make Qin Yu a little anxious.

The array flag was very important to Qin Yu because it was one of the ways to enter the Holy Region.

If no one from the holy region ever came again, then the array flag could only go to the holy region.

Qin Yu looked out of the window at the calm sea, and his heart became more and more anxious.

This made it even harder for him to fall asleep.

Therefore, he got up and walked out of the laboratory.

Professor chicken was not sleeping. He was discng something with a group of mercenaries.

Seeing Qin Yu walking out, professor chicken waved his hand and said, “Go back quickly. It’s no longer safe here.”

Hearing this, Qin Yid in surprise, “Professor Chicken, you have thought of a way?”

“That’s right. After so many years of research, we have long had a way to summon creatures from the sea,”said Professor Chicken.

A trace of doubt flashed across Qin Yface.

Even the spell to summon a demon beast was very difficult to learn, let alone other methods?

Moreover, who could guarantee that the demon beast summoned was a sea chicken?

Professor Chicken didn’t explain further and only stared at the surface of the sea. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

A moment later, two mercenaries came out with a piece of equipment.

The equipment looked quite strange. There was a huge horn pointing at the surface of the sea, as if it was going to emit some sound.

“What is this thing?”Qin Yu asked.

Professor chicken shook his head and said, “I can see that you don’t have much knowledge, so I can’t explain it to you. You only need to know that this thing can summon a sea chicken.”

This made Qin Yu feel a little awkward. In front of Professor Chicken, Qin Yu indeed didn’t have much knowledge, but he didn’t really believe Professor Chicken’s words.

Then, Professor Chicken pressed the switch on the device.

He thought that the device would emit some strange sound, but what surprised Qin Yu was that the device actually didn’t make any sound. It was completely silent.

“This sound can summon sea chickens, and it can only summon sea chickens,”professor chicken said.

Qin Yratched his head and said, “How can there be a sound?”

Professor Chicken looked at Qin Yu with some disdain and said, “It’s not a sound. It’s something that we humans can hear.”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and suddenly understood. At the same time, he felt a little ashamed.

Ever since he entered the path of cultivation, Qin Yu had not taken scientific research seriously.

However, after this incident, Qin Yu finally understood that different professions were like different mountains. Qin Yu did not understand science, just like professor chicken did not understand magic.

When dealing with all things that were own, one should maintain a heart of reverence.

“Let’s wait. At the latest, in an hour, that sea chicken will definitely appear.”Professor Chicken had his hands behind his back. His originally slightly hunched body now looked somewhat tall.

“Let’s hurry back. That laboratory is made of special materials. That sea creature can not enter.”Professor Chicken pointed at the laboratory and said.

Qin Yook his head and said, “Professor Chicken, I’m afraid you have really underestimated this sea chicken.”

“You have underestimated our weapons.”Professor Chicken said faintly.

Qin Yu could not help but sigh in his heart.

Professor Chicken, who had mastered top-notch technology, naturally would not believe Qin Ywords.

Helpless, Qin Yu could only retreat to the side and quietly watch the sea surface.

As the sound of the equipment was emitted, the sky suddenly became a little gloomy.

Large patches of dark closuddenly appeared in the sky, covering the original blue color.

The sea surface also began to become restless.

From time to time, large waves would blow up, slapping the surface of the sea and making loud sounds.

It was as though a storm was coming.

Professor Chicken placed his hands behind his back and said calmly, “That beast is coming.”

Qin Yu also activated his desolate God’s eye at the same time, looking straight at the bottom of the sea.

“Splash...”

The waves on the surface of the sea were getting bigger and bigger. In the distance, there were waves that were only half a meter high. But when they got closer, they were already several stories high!

At the same time, through the desolate God’s eye, Qin Yw the demon beast that was churning under the sea!

This Demon Beast was the sea chicken!

“So Powerful!”

Qin Yu could not help but be shocked! He was immediately more interested in Professor Chicken’s equipment!

It turned out that other than spells, there were other ways to summon Demon Beasts!
