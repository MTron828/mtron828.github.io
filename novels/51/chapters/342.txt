Chapter 343: Entering Jingdu Again Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu said goodbye to everyone one by one, and then went straight to the Pavilion Master’s residence.

He wanted to jump up, but fortunately, he stopped in time.

“I almost forgot.” Qin Yu scratched his head.

He stood below and shouted to the top, “Pavilion Master, I’m going up.”

But there was no response from the top.

Qin Yu summoned his spirit energy and flew up into the sky.

This time, the Pavilion Master didn’t make a move.

She seemed to have expected it and sat there quietly waiting.

“Pavilion Master, I’m ready to leave the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.” Qin Yu said to the Pavilion Master with a slight bow.

The Pavilion Master nodded and said casually, “You may go.”

Qin Yu felt a little awkward. He coughed and said, “Pavilion Master, can you let me take the herbs first?”

Hearing this, the Pavilion Master couldn’t help but laugh.

She waved her hand and said with a half-hearted smile, “You will come back.”

Qin Yu originally wanted to ask, but he knew that the Pavilion Master didn’t like him asking too much, so he gave up this idea.

“Pavilion Master, I’m leaving.” Qin Yu bowed to the Pavilion Master, then turned his head and left.

...

This time, Qin Yu didn’t bring Yao Qing.

He went to the airport to buy a plane ticket, then headed straight for Jingdu.

At this time, although Old Mister Yan wasn’t feeling well and had even gone to the hospital, he didn’t seem to display any abnormalities.

He was at home playing chess games as usual. Other than that, he didn’t have any other hobbies.

Yan Ruoxue was clueless about the news of Old Mister Yan’s imminent death.

This was Qin Yu’s second trip to Jingdu.

This time was much more dangerous than the previous trip. After all, there was no military district to back him up this time.

More importantly, if something happened to Old Mister Yan, the Yan family would most likely take action and get rid of Qin Yu.

The Divine Alchemist Pavilion wasn’t too close to Jingdu. Qin Yu finally arrived at Jingdu in the evening.

As he stood at the airport, he couldn’t help but feel conflicted.

It was already seven o’clock in the evening. It was probably inappropriate to go to the Yan family at this time.

After thinking over and over again, Qin Yu finally decided to find a place to stay for the time being. He would go to the Yan family the next day.

“Mr. Qin?”

At this moment, a familiar voice suddenly came from behind Qin Yu.

After turning around, he realized that Fang Yue was actually standing behind him.

Beside her was a young man in a suit and leather shoes. The young man was wearing a famous brand, and his temperament was elegant. He had the bearing of a successful person.

“Fang Yue?” Qin Yu was also somewhat surprised.

Fang Yue covered her mouth and laughed lightly. “Mr. Qin, we really are fated.”

Qin Yu said with some surprise, “Why did you come to Jingdu?”

“I came to Jingdu to discuss something,” Fang Yue said while blinking her eyes.

Then, she looked at the young man next to her and introduced him, “This is my friend Xiang Zhuang. He’s a big shot in Jingdu.”

The young man Called Xiang Zhuang hurriedly waved his hand and said, “I’m just the small boss of a company.”

“This is the famous King of Chuzhou and an Elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion,” Fang Yue introduced him to Qin Yu.

“An Elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?” Xiang Zhuang immediately became extremely respectful when he heard this.

He quickly walked forward and shook hands with Qin Yu while saying, “Mr. Qin, it is my honor to meet you!”

“This is my business card. If you need help in Jingdu, feel free to ask,” Xiang Zhuang said respectfully.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh. His identity as an Elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion was really useful.

After taking Xiang Zhuang’s business card, Qin Yu glanced at it and found that Xiang Zhuang’s company was named Xiang Real Estate. It was probably the family’s business.

“By the way, how did you know my identity as an Elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?” Qin Yu glanced at Fang Yue and asked suspiciously.

Fang Yue rolled her eyes and said, “The Divine Alchemist Pavilion changing its Elder is a big matter. It has been reported long ago.”

Qin Yu scratched his head and said, “Where was it reported?”

“The Martial Arts Forum,” said Fang Yue.

“The Martial Arts Forum...” Qin Yu immediately became very interested in this forum.

“Mr. Qin, you haven’t eaten yet, right? It’s my treat. Let’s find a place to eat something,” said Xiang Zhuang.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Thank you for your kind intentions, Mr. Xiang, but I won’t go.”

“Mr. Qin, please don’t stand on ceremony. If I don’t show my hospitality as a host, it would be too unreasonable!” Xiang Zhuang said enthusiastically.

Qin Yu wanted to refuse, but it was hard to refuse his kind offer.

In addition, Qin Yu really had nowhere to go, so he nodded and agreed.

Thus, the three of them left the airport.

Under Xiang Zhuang’s arrangement, their car drove into the city and arrived at a high-end restaurant.

“Mr. Qin, Miss Fang, you guys can go in first. I’ll park the car,” Xiang Zhuang said politely.

Fang Yue nodded. She looked at Qin Yu and said, “Let’s go.”

The two of them took the lead and entered the restaurant.

This restaurant was extremely big, and it was full of dining tables and private rooms.

Qin Yu and Fang Yue found a place to sit temporarily and waited for Xiang Zhuang.

“Oh right, I just happen to have a request. I wonder if it’s convenient for you, Mr. Qin.” Fang Yue said with a charming smile.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Go ahead.”

Fang Yue thought for a moment and said, “I need a kind of pill, but this kind of pill is extremely difficult to refine. Other than the Elders of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, almost no one else can succeed. Moreover, only the Divine Alchemist Pavilion has the pill formula.”

Speaking up to this point, Fang Yue paused for a moment and said somewhat embarrassedly, “But the Divine Alchemist Pavilion takes this pill formula very seriously. Moreover, it has a clear rule that it isn’t allowed to refine pills for outsiders.”

Qin Yu said with some surprise, “Don’t tell me you want to do something that harms the interests of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. If that’s the case, I can’t do it.”

“No. It’s just that this kind of pill has a relatively great side effect, so it’s forbidden by the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.” Fang Yue smiled and shook her head.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “Alright then, give me the name of the pill. I’ll help you ask later.”

Fang Yue smiled and said, “Thank you, Mr. Qin.”

“Since you and I have formed an alliance, it’s only right for us to help each other,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

Fang Yue wasn’t in a hurry to tell Qin Yu the name of the pill. Instead, she planned to find some time to tell Qin Yu via text message.

Seeing how cautious she was, Qin Yu didn’t ask further.

“What’s your relationship with Xiang Zhuang?” Qin Yu asked casually.

Fang Yue jokingly said, “Mr. Qin, are you jealous?”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “Pretend I didn’t say anything.”

Fang Yue smiled and said seriously, “A friend. If you want to establish a foothold in Jingdu, you naturally have to make more friends.”

At this point, Fang Yue asked, “What about you?”

“I have something to do,” Qin Yu said casually.

Fang Yue was a smart person. She saw that Qin Yu didn’t want to say more, so she didn’t continue to ask.

“I also know a few people in Jingdu. If you need my help, just let me know,” Fang Yue said with a smile.

“Okay.” Qin Yu nodded and agreed.

With Fang Yue’s charm, it wasn’t difficult for her to expand her network.

Moreover, there had been rumors that many important figures in Jingdu were unable to resist Fang Yue’s charm. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

If they were to go all out against the Han family in the future, Qin Yu alone would definitely not be enough.

Relying on martial strength naturally would not work either.

Regardless of which top aristocratic family it was in Jingdu, their development was extremely comprehensive.

Business, martial arts, and support were indispensable.

At that time, Fang Yue might really be able to help.

At this moment, Fang Yue’s cell phone rang.

After she picked up the phone, she said, “Mr. Qin, I’m going out for a while. Wait for me for a moment.”

“Okay.” Qin Yu nodded.

After Fang Yue left, Qin Yu took out his cell phone and opened the Martial Arts Forum.

As expected, the official account of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion had announced it.

And under this piece of news, there were already countless comments.

“What does the Divine Alchemist Pavilion mean? Is this a statement of stance?”

“Could it be that there is some conflict between the Divine Alchemist Pavilion and the Han family?”

“Looks like the Divine Alchemist Pavilion isn’t afraid of the Han family at all.”

The Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s actions were undoubtedly a public announcement that the Divine Alchemist Pavilion would stand behind Qin Yu.

Qin Yu closed the article and continued to flip through the news.

At that moment, Qin Yu saw a piece of news titled “Pyro’s Martial Artists Ranking Board”.
