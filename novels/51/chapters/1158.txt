Chapter 1159: Chapter 1,159, the cruel Gu Xinghe 

“What exactly are you planning to do?”Yan Yongfu asked.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “You don’t need to know too much.”

With that, Qin Yu no longer paid attention to Yan Yongfu.

...

In the blink of an eye, a few days passed.

In these few days, the scale of the martial arts association in Jingdu had developed to an extremely terrifying scale.

This scale had even surpassed the peak state of the past!

This also made Gu Xinghe extremely satisfied.

He stood on top of the tall building of the martial arts association in Jingdu, overlooking more than half of Jingdu. That feeling was as if he was looking down on the land he had conquered.

“Uncle Zhai Xing, do you see? All of this is the result of my hard work,”Gu Xinghe said faintly.

Zhai Xing stood behind him and did not say a word.

“My achievements far surpass my father’s generation and those eight high-ranking officials! I Am the true king of this world!”Gu Xinghe laughed loudly.

Zhai Xing opened his mouth and said, “Young Master Gu, you should still look at the holy region. That is the true vast world of cultivators...”

“Shut up!”

At the mention of the Holy Region, Gu Xinghe’s face was full of anger!

“It was not easy for me to have all of this. You Want Me to give up? You want me to go to the holy region and start all over again!”Gu Xinghe said angrily.

Zhai xing sighed, “But... the people of the holy region will come sooner or later.”

“Then I will destroy the formation stage! I will never allow anyone to destroy everything I have!”Gu Xinghe’s eyes were wide open and he was extremely emotional.

Zhai Xing could not help but sigh in his heart.

Gu Xinghe’s vision was too low. He did not want to compete with those geniuses at all. He only wanted to protect his own plot of land.

However, the wheels of history would not stop for anyone.

Everything was like sailing against the current. If one did not advance, one would retreat. No one could forever protect their own achievements.

“In three days, gather all the martial artists in the world to come to the martial arts association in Jingdu. I want to publicly punish Qin Yu and the others,”Gu Xinghe said coldly.

Zhai Xing’s expression changed. He hurriedly said, “Young master Gu, Qin Yu will go to the holy region sooner or later. He won’t fight with you for the martial arts association in Jingdu!”

“How about this? I’ll be the middleman. I’ll advise him to go to the holy region. It definitely won’t affect your rule. Can you let him go?”

Gu Xinghe narrowed his eyes slightly.

He sized up Zhai Xing and sneered, “Even now, you still want to protect Qin Yu. Do you think that’s possible?”

Zhai Xing’s expression was a little ugly, but he did not know how to respond.

Gu Xinghe sneered, “Since you care so much about him, then you will deal with Qin Yu.”

“I...”

“If you don’t agree, I will kill you and kill everyone related to Qin Yu.”

Before Zhai Xing could speak, Gu Xinghe said coldly.

A trace of despair flashed across Zhai Xing’s face. He gritted his teeth and lowered his head, “I understand.”

...

In the first secret realm, Qin Yu’s comprehension of the fifth level of the fighting word formula had reached its peak. It was as if he could comprehend the fifth level of the fighting word formula at any time.

He closed his eyes tightly. All his thoughts were focused on the fighting word formula, and he did not dare to be distracted at all.

“Swish!”

Very soon, a trace of brilliance flashed through Qin Yu’s mind.

It was as if he had pierced through a layer of window paper. All his thoughts were connected as if they had been formed by the passage of time.

Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes and said in a low voice, “It’s a success.”

“It’s a success?”Yan Yongfu hurriedly looked at Qin Yu, his eyes filled with anticipation.

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude. He took a deep breath and looked at the chain not far away.

This chain was binding the primordial spirit. It was indeed very difficult to break free.

“Are you confident?”Yan Yongfu asked eagerly.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “It shouldn’t be a problem.”

Yan Yongfu didn’t dare to say anything. All his hopes were placed on Qin Yu.

He probably never dreamed that one day, he would wait for Qin Yu to save him.

Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly and a mark flashed across his glabella!

This mark was a huge ‘Dou’character!

The fifth level of the ‘Dou’character appeared in an instant!

Qin Yu’s strength began to increase exponentially at this moment!

In just a few short seconds, Qin Yu’s strength had increased by dozens of times!

Although his realm hadn’t changed, his true strength wasn’t on the same level!

Even these higher-ups could feel the terrifying pressure coming from Qin Yu’s body!

“Could it be that you’ve broken through? !”Yan Yongfu exclaimed in shock.

This level of strength was clearly at the Almighty Realm!

However, Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No, this is the battle word formula.”

“Nine secret battle word formula? !”Yan Yongfu seemed to have thought of something!

This kind of spell was a top-notch item even in the holy region. It was enough to attract the top experts of the entire holy region!

Qin Yu didn’t say anything else. His body suddenly trembled, and he actually stood up!

Then, a small golden figure walked out from between his brows. The golden figure grabbed the chain and forcefully dragged it up!

In the blink of an eye, the small golden figure forcefully pulled back the divine sense that had been extracted!

Following that, the small golden figure slashed down on the chain!

“Kacha!”

A crisp sound rang out! The chain shattered!

Many of the higher-ups in the room opened their eyes wide!

This Qin Yu had actually broken free from the shackles of the chain!

Qin Yu slowly stood up. At this moment, his body was emitting an extremely powerful force. This force brought with it an extremely oppressive feeling, causing people to be unable to raise their heads!

“Qin Yu, quick, quickly save me!”Yan Yongfu said anxiously.

Qin Yu glanced at Yan Yongfu, then raised his palm and pulled Yan Yongfu’s divine sense back. After that, he cut off the chain.

Yan Yongfu hurriedly stood up and escaped from this pain. Traces of comfort swarmed over. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Finally...”Yan Yongfu was so excited that tears flowed down his face!

The other higher-ups at the side also said, “Qin Yu, save us...”

Su Qi even lowered her body, revealing her ample career line.

“Qin Yu, as long as you’re willing to save me, I’ll be your slave in the future. I’ll listen to everything you say...”Su Qi said in a trembling voice.
