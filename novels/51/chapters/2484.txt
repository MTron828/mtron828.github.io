2485 The Alliance’s Visit

Amidst the terrifying flames, the flickering fire spark suddenly froze at a specific moment.

A slightly pale fist suddenly appeared in front of the Vermilion Bird. The Vermilion Bird was shocked to find itself staring blankly at the fist.

In its divine thought, it seemed to have forgotten to resist the fist’s force.

Immortal Crane smiled faintly and exhaled a breath.

Along with this demonic breath he exhaled, the flames began to flicker again.

After the Vermilion Bird retreated 10,000 meters away, Xiao Sheng had already returned to the peak, sitting with crossed legs.

“What a terrifying human! His fist is so powerful that it can intimidate and suppress everything. Vermilion Bird must not provoke him again in the future.”

Immortal Crane left with a faint smile after saying this.

“Yes.”

Vermilion Bird dared not retort.

Meanwhile, at Huaning Mountain, Wang Feng, leading a group of Formation Masters, was planning how to set up a grand formation.

Once the alien race invaded, they could activate the formation in time.

For this matter, he even specifically approached Qin Yu.

He could borrow the spiritual essence, treasures, and others to set it up if it was a temporary formation.

However, it would not last long, and he would have to set up the formation another way if he wanted to make Huaning Mountain the foundation.

“Let’s make this place our foundation. If this place is fallen, I’m afraid the places where humans can survive in this world will greatly reduce.”

Qin Yu gave Wang Feng an affirmative answer.

Huaning Mountain was a passage located in the North Plain, Zhongzhou, and the eastern area.

If this place fell, it was equivalent to the various races dividing the human race into countless parts and the human race falling into an all-encompassing crisis.

As the news spread recently, many powerful rogue cultivators admired Dean Lei and Flower Granny. Some cultivators in Nanzhou had also witnessed Qin Yu resist the invasion of the cultivators of North Plain. These people knew Qin Yu’s character.

Therefore, they joined Human Race Watch to do their part for the human race.

Currently, in the Human Race Watch, 18 cultivators were above the Tribulation Transcending Stage, nearly 400 were above the fifth-grade True Saint, and more than 3,000 were below the fifth-grade True Saint.

Suddenly, Qin Yu, cultivating in seclusion, sensed something.

His body suddenly appeared in mid-air. Almost at the same time, Yan Ruoxue, Lei Xin, and Flower Granny also arrived.

Chang Mang, Jue Wu, Elder Huai, Piao Ruoyun, Mei Li, and the others soon arrived.

The internal qi of the four people in the lead were vigorous. From the clothes they were wearing, Qin Yu knew that they were from the new eight forces.

“What’s the matter, Seniors?”

Qin Yu asked, cupping his fists. He knew Si Liuhe and Lei Li.

The other two should be the Supreme Elders of the Gu and the Jiang family. It was not too much to call them seniors.

“You’re indeed at the prime of youth. However, why did you walk the path of an anomaly?”

Jiang Qingyuan sighed and continued.

“Qin Yu, before we talk, let me say something first. This time, we are here for the overall situation of the human race. The establishment of Human Race Watch is good, but it will ultimately be under the unified management of the eight great aristocratic families. Whether it is to deal with the future chaos or to join actions, it will be beneficial.”

“The nine great aristocratic families again? After so many years of seizing resources from various places, we joined Human Race Watch, and now you’re stretching your hands here. What a joke! If Human Race Watch joins them, I’ll leave immediately.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Someone laughed coldly.

A group of people around immediately echoed. Many powerful cultivators joined the Human Race Watch because they could not stand the so-called nine great aristocratic families.

They wanted to join an alliance that could truly fight for the greater cause. If they were under the supervision of the eight forces, it would be no different from joining them.

“You are unwilling to listen to the summons of our eight great families?”

Lei Li’s voice was sharp and assertive.

“Gentlemen, the oath that we made when founding Human Race Watch is for the sake of the human race, not intrigues. If the nine great aristocratic families are really doing this for the sake of righteousness, they shouldn’t be pressuring us.”

Qin Yu shook his head. He was really worried about joining forces with the new eight major forces.

He had already suffered enough backstabbing from them.

Moreover, even if the Ni, the Yao, and the Ji family exited the eight forces, they still had some people in the alliance. Ji Yue had already investigated and gathered the information.

Once they joined forces, how could he trust these people and leave the juniors with them?

“Martial Uncle Bai, Martial Uncle Jiang, I know what the alliance is worrying about, but please believe in our faith.”

Lei Xin knew the two and had great respect for them.

“Lei Xin, this is Revered Qi’s intention. The alliance has received the video of Qin Yu, Xiao Sheng, and Xiao Hai fighting against Yuan Xiu. If Human Race Watch joins the demons, it will be a terrifying scene for the humans.”

Gu Baiyi shook her head.

“Three days later, the alliance will send people to handle some details. You should plan in advance and will still be in charge here. But once there is news about the alliance, you must cooperate.”

Jiang Qingyuan said softly.

“Bullsh*t, we haven’t agreed yet.”

Chang Mang was furious and wanted to stop him.

“Yes, Martial Uncle.”

Lei Xin placed a hand on Chang Mang’s shoulder, stopping him from speaking.

“Young man, I heard that you have a good relationship with the saintess of my family. I’ll let you have a taste of it before I leave.”

Gu Baiyi covered her mouth, laughed, and said. She extended a long finger.

As she pointed at the air, the outside world did not seem to have changed in the slightest.

But the world before Qin Yu had turned into a vast expanse of water.

“Martial Uncle Gu’s boundless tsunami is still so terrifying.”

Lei Xin sighed and said.

An endless tsunami crashed down in front of Qin Yu. The seawater rolled up into massive waves that swept over, destroying everything.

Pure power emanated between the tsunamis without any changes in the Path of Heaven.

“Whoosh!”

The moment before the terrifying force clashed with Qin Yu, it suddenly disappeared as if it had never appeared.

“The path of anomaly is extraordinary. Based on my understanding, after many people have chosen this path, they have fallen silent. It is tough to open up a new path for themselves. Today, with a single finger, I will let you understand the changes in this place.”

The four soared into the air and departed, leaving behind the silent crowd.

At this moment, Qin Yu was drenched in cold sweat.

He had wanted to use the spatial primordial rune to open a passage, but the massive power of a vast expanse of water had cut it off.

The power of the tsunami that could destroy everything made him feel that he would be severely injured regardless of what he did.

It also made him doubt whether his path of anomaly was the right path.

In that instant, Gu Baiyi seemed to have possessed the Path of Heaven of water and fused the fifth-level power of the origin into her body. Qin Yu could not resist it at all.

This was a kind of suppression in terms of the cultivation realm, even though the power they unleashed could also reach the fifth grade.
