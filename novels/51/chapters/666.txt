Everyone discussed animatedly. It was obvious that they felt pity for Qin Yu.

After all, over the years, Qin Yu was the only person who forcefully broke into the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s prison.

His body dragged on the ground, and a long bloody scar appeared on the ground.

Qin Yu, who was covered in blood, looked extremely miserable. His unconscious state made people feel that his life and death were unknown.

Soon, Qin Yu was brought to the opposite side of a prison.

This prison was opposite to Yan Ruoxue.

The moment Qin Yu appeared, a trace of fear flashed across Yan Ruoxue’s pale face.

“Crash...”

Yan Ruoxue’s struggling movement caused the entire pipe to make a loud noise.

“Qin Yu...” Yan Ruoxue stared in Qin Yu’s direction. A trace of pain appeared on her fair and tender face.

She didn’t know the inside story. She only knew Qin Yu had been caught!

And Yan Ruoxue knew very well what it meant if Qin Yu was caught!

“I’m sorry... I’ve implicated you...” Yan Ruoxue’s tears fell like broken beads.

The pain in her heart exploded at this moment. Deep in her heart, she blamed herself.

Qin Yu was thrown into this prison. At this moment, Qin Yu was still in a coma.

He didn’t know anything about the outside world.

At this moment, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association also began to move quickly.

Qu Xie immediately reported this news to the higher-ups.

The higher-ups also quickly held a meeting.

In the meeting room.

These eight higher-ups were still hidden in the darkness. No one could see their true appearances.

“Since Qin Yu has been captured, let’s deal with it as soon as possible.” A voice came from the darkness.

“En, this child can’t be kept. We must get rid of him as soon as possible.”

“Xia Hang, since it was you who captured Qin Yu, I’ll leave this matter to you to handle.”

When Xia Hang heard this, he hurriedly stood up and said, “Thank you for the appreciation of the high-ranking officials.”

“This time, you’ve made a meritorious deed. The Jingdu Martial Arts Association will remember it.” Another voice came out.

It seemed that everything was within Qin Yu’s calculations.

This also caused Xia Hang to feel some admiration for Qin Yu in his heart.

“This Qin Yu is really not as simple as I imagined.” Xia Hang thought in his heart.

“It’s just... What method should he use to escape?”

Xia Hang had never been able to figure out this question.

Qu Xie stood up from the side and said, “All the higher-ups, right now the authorities also want to capture this Qin Yu. Regarding the matter of dealing with Qin Yu, I’m afraid we have to report it to the higher-ups and get the approval of the documents.”

The higher-ups were silent for a moment, then said, “Then go and deal with him as soon as possible. If he lives for one more day, I will feel more uneasy.”

Qu Xie couldn’t help but be shocked when he heard that.

This Qin Yu had already made the higher-ups feel uneasy?

After the meeting ended, Qu Xie looked at Xia Hang.

“Xia Hang, since the higher-ups have given this task to you, you should go and handle it as soon as possible and get the documents as soon as possible,” Qu Xie said coldly.

Xia Hang nodded slightly and said, “Don’t worry, I will naturally carry out the orders of the higher-ups.”

After saying this, Xia Hang turned around and left.

This made Qu Xie feel a little unhappy.

Xia Hang’s intention was obviously to be responsible to the higher-ups, not to him, the president!

Qu Xie looked at Xia Hang’s back coldly and couldn’t help but Snort coldly. “This lowly one has achieved success. Do you really think that you can become a Phoenix by catching Qin Yu?”

...

The news of Qin Yu’s capture spread like wildfire.

Almost everyone knew about it at once.

“It’s said Qin Yu knew he would be caught, so he took revenge!”

“I also heard that he killed Deng Sheng first and then wanted to kill Yan Guiyi! Later, he went straight to Xia Hang’s residence!”

“I heard Qin Yu killed a purple robe before he was caught! That purple robe is the famous Geng Si!”

“It’s really shocking. Unfortunately, it’s all over.”

...

The Yan and Han families naturally received the news quickly.

In a certain natural secret room of the Yan family, Yan Sihai was standing beside Yan Jinyao.

This was the place where Yan Jinyao was in seclusion.

“Dad, Qin Yu was captured?” Yan Jinyao asked faintly with his eyes slightly closed.

Yan sihai nodded and said, “That’s right. I heard that before he was captured, he forcefully beheaded a purple-robed man. It was precisely for this reason Qin Yu was exhausted and fell into Xia Hang’s hands.”

Hearing this, Yan Jinyao couldn’t help but clench his fists!

Beheaded a purple-robed man? Such a battle record had already left Yan Jinyao far behind!

Yan Jinyao still had some confidence in an ordinary black-gold robe.

But if he were to face a purple-robed man, he wouldn’t be able to retaliate at all!

“Dad, you can go out. I’m going into seclusion.” Yan Jinyao took a deep breath and forced himself to calm down.

Yan Sihai patted Yan Jinyao’s shoulder and said, “Don’t think too much. Qin Yu has already become a dead man.”

“I know.” Yan Jinyao closed his eyes slightly and didn’t say anything more.

...

At this time, the Han family was celebrating.

Han Wei held the red wine in his hand and danced excitedly.

The gap between him and Qin Yu was getting bigger and bigger. He had long given up on catching up and surpassing Qin Yu. He only hoped Qin Yu would die early!

“Dad, I heard Qin Yu was locked in front of Yan Ruoxue?” Han Wei suddenly thought of something and hurriedly stood up.

Han Meng nodded and said, “Yes, Qu Xie did this on purpose.”

Han Wei narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “Dad, I want to see Qin Yu.”

“See Qin Yu? Are you crazy?” Han Meng frowned and said.

Han Wei glanced at Han Meng and said, “Dad, I said that I would humiliate Qin Yu in front of Yan Ruoxue, but I didn’t do it. If I don’t vent my anger, I won’t be satisfied!”

Han Meng frowned and then said, “But it’s not that easy to get in the prison of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

“Dad, just find some connections and think of a way, okay?” Han Wei’s tone was a bit pleading.

Seeing this, Han Meng couldn’t help but sigh.

Ever since the battle with Qin Yu, Han Wei had become a loser without any pursuits. All of this was because of the blow from that battle. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Okay.” Han Meng’s expression darkened as he agreed.

...

In the prison, Qin Yu was still unconscious.

However, all kinds of images was constantly appearing in his brain.

Beads of sweat appeared on his forehead. Even though he was unconscious, Qin Yu was still thinking about his plan.

“I must not fail. I must not fail...” Qin Yu’s heart was filled with fear.

At this time, he suddenly opened his eyes and shouted, “I must not fail!”
