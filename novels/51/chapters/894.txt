Chapter 895: Chapter 895, the effects of dao injuries 

Normally, stepping into the half-step martial saint realm would not cause much of a reaction.

However, Qin Yu’s reaction was extremely intense!

The entire mystic realm seemed to have been affected, and gusts of wind blew!

Waves of intense pain came from Qin Yu’s Dantian!

That Aura seemed as if it was about to fly out of his golden core. The intense pain in his abdomen caused Qin Yu’s body to turn into a shrimp-shaped internal Qi!

“AH...”this pain was unbearable even for Qin Yu!

His body kept releasing violent power, almost flattening the surrounding area!

“Ah! ! !”

Qin Yu could not help but shout out loud!

He grimaced in pain, kneeling on the ground with his fists clenched tightly.

Such a big movement naturally woke up Yan Ruoxue who was in seclusion.

When she heard Qin Yu’s voice, her expression immediately changed and she hurriedly ran in Qin Yu’s direction.

At the same time, Li Yu also heard the news and came over.

The two of them looked at Qin Yu who was in extreme pain and a trace of worry flashed across their faces.

“This... What exactly is going on?”Li Yu said with a shocked expression.

From this scene, it didn’t seem like he was breaking through at all!

“Qin Yu!”Yan Ruoxue couldn’t bear to see Qin Yu Suffer Like This. She shouted and ran towards Qin Yu.

The moment he heard Yan Ruoxue’s voice, Qin Yu hurriedly raised his head and looked in the direction of Yan Ruoxue.

“Not good...”Qin Yu’s expression changed.

The violent energy in his body would probably injure Yan Ruoxue!

Thinking of this, Qin Yu hurriedly adjusted the internal Qi in his body and tried his best to stabilize this power.

Qin Yu’s forehead kept breaking out in cold sweat. The internal Qi in his body was actually controlled in a short period of time!

“TSK TSK, is this the power of Love?”Li Yu could not help but mutter at the side.

Perhaps it was because he was worried about Yan Ruoxue and triggered his potential, in short, Qin Yu’s golden core actually stabilized at this moment.

His internal Qi was slowly recovering, and the golden core also began to slowly take shape.

“Miss Yan, it’s better for you to come back. Qin Yu should be fine now.”Li Yu waved to Yan Ruoxue.

“He is now at the critical moment of his breakthrough. It’s best not to disturb him.”

Hearing this, Yan Ruoxue also stopped in her tracks.

Although she was extremely worried, she still obediently walked to the side.

Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the ground, slowly feeling the increase in his strength.

His internal Qi was rapidly increasing, becoming more and more dense, and his body became more and more indestructible!

This process lasted for a whole four hours!

It was not until four hours later that Qin Yu’s internal Qi completely calmed down.

“Hu.”

Qin Yu exhaled a mouthful of turbid internal QI. He stood up from the ground and said in a low voice, “That injury... really did affect me.”

The dangerous scene just now was still vivid in his mind.

If it were not for Yan Ruoxue, Qin Yu would not have been able to control his golden core!

And there was only one final result, which was to explode and die!

This could not help but make Qin Yu feel waves of lingering fear!

If he encountered such a situation when he was breaking through to the martial saint realm, he would most likely die without a doubt!

“Qin Yu, are you... Okay?”Yan Ruoxue walked over quickly.

Qin Yu nodded and said with a smile, “Very good. My strength seems to have increased exponentially.”

Ever since he entered the Martial Marquis realm, every time Qin Yu made a breakthrough, his strength would increase exponentially. This time was no exception.

“Just now... What Happened?”Yan Ruoxue’s big eyes were full of worry.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “It’s still because of the dao injury in my body. If it wasn’t for you just now, I might have exploded and died.”

“Exploded and died?”Yan Ruoxue’s face turned pale.

“Then... is there no way to cure this wound?”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly, “There is, but you need a material. This kind of material... can not be found in this world.”

“Material? What material?”Yan Ruoxue asked hurriedly.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “It seems to be called Heavenly Vanilla.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Heavenly vanilla...”Yan Ruoxue silently remembered this name.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “It’s not a big problem. I will think of a way to solve it.”

Although he said this, Qin Yu was extremely worried.

The impact of this injury had far exceeded Qin Yu’s expectations.

He had only broken through to the half-step martial saint realm, but his body had almost exploded and died. If he had broken through to the martial saint realm, the impact would have been even greater.

Breaking through to the martial saint realm was an extremely dangerous matter. One moment of carelessness could result in death, not to mention this wound.

“It seems that... Before I break through, I might have to think of a way to resolve this wound.”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Although he thought so inwardly, Qin Yu’s expression did not show it at all.

“Wow, you’re actually going to break through to the Martial Grandmaster Realm?”At this moment, Qin Yu was surprised to discover that Yan Ruoxue’s strength had soared once again!

Yan Ruoxue thought for a moment and said, “Maybe it’s because of my experience in the second mystic realm that I’m breaking through very quickly now.”

“That makes sense.”Qin Yu nodded.

The key to the improvement of strength was the improvement of one’s state of mind.

As long as one’s state of mind was high enough, under the condition of sufficient Qi/spiritual energy, the improvement of cultivation would be smooth and unimpeded.

This was also why many top cultivators would choose to temper themselves when they encountered a bottleneck, or even pay for their own cultivation.

Moreover, Yan Ruoxue still had the bloodline of the Yan family.

In the next few days, Yan Ruoxue continued to cultivate while Qin Yu stood guard at the side.

At night.

Qin Yu looked at Li Yu and asked, “How long have we been in this mystic realm?”

Li Yu roughly calculated and said, “About three months.”

“More than three months...”Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a bit worried.

“I plan to go out and take a look,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“Go Out? I think you’re Crazy,”Li Yu sneered.

“It’s not a big deal if you want to die. The key is not to implicate Miss Yan.”

Although Li Yu’s words were not pleasant to hear, they were very reasonable.

Qin Yu sat there and sighed slightly, “I have a feeling that many people will be implicated because of me.”

“This is not a good thing for people who are in closed-door cultivation,”Li Yu said.

“One must be free of distracting thoughts in closed-door cultivation. How can you do that with your state of mind?”

Qin Yu sighed and said, “Yes...”

Just as the two of them were chatting, Yan Ruoxue’s internal Qi suddenly began to change.

In the sky, dark clouds gathered.

“She’s... going to become a martial grandmaster!”Qin Yu exclaimed.
