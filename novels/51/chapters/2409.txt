2410 Pincer Attack

“What should we do? Elder Guai, have you ever studied the methods of the sorcerer tribe? Is there any way to crack this Disgusting Charm technique?”

Ji Yue’s body trembled. They would all die if Qin Yu lost.

It was hard to crack! The Disgusting Charm technique was the core of the sorcerer tribe. The earliest to use this method was King Zhou of Shang. His target was truly astonishing: heavenly gods. King Zhou once made a puppet, claiming it was a heavenly god. He insulted and shot at it, calling it “shooting the heavens”. The little girl unexpectedly mastered this technique.

Elder Guai looked solemn. He did not expect Qin Yu’s Tribulation First Level soul power to be nearly helpless against this little girl.

Sorcery Domain!

Ji Yuyi looked up at the sky, her pupils like lanterns.

A layer of faintly discernible domain power suddenly covered Qin Yu from the puppet’s body. In an instant, the red light was tremendously bright.

In Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness, he suddenly felt a power several times stronger piercing through his divine sense. More red threads connected to his soul.

“Mo Keyi, you’re so ugly. Quickly dress up.”

The puppet’s face was covered in blood from the top of its head at this moment. It looked like a demon from hell.

Mo Keyi grabbed the mirror and the comb with one hand, combing her hair.

In an instant, the space around the puppet rippled, and a small circular space opened up like a door. Intense dark energy rushed in, and hundreds of spirits rushed out and surrounded the puppet.

The faces of the hundreds of spirits were so pale that they were almost transparent. They had strange smiles on their faces as they stared at Qin Yu with Mo Keyi.

Coupled with the fiery red light of the domain, even Saintess Gu looked ashen and retreated repeatedly.

A wave rippled in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness. He felt an enormous iron hook appear in his sea of consciousness.

The iron hook deeply hooked into his soul, and nine massive wounds appeared.

Countless black mists were released from the wound again. On closer look, it was actually a parasite as big as a gadfly.

Qin Yu’s face was covered in a visible black energy. The internal qi of his soul aura suddenly dropped rapidly, and he spat out a mouthful of tremendously black blood. In the blood he spat out, countless parasites slowly squirmed.

“It’s actually the human bone comb and the evil spirit mirror. These two things are two of the nine great Saint Weapons of the ancestor of sorcery. When the ancient ancestor of sorcery was exterminated, they disappeared together. I didn’t expect the Ji family to have obtained them. Qin Yu is in trouble now. Do you have any solutions?”

The man with the mustache stood beside Saintess Gu and asked with a solemn expression.

“I don’t have any solutions either. I came here because the Gu family’s Holy Lord discovered something the Ji family had set up and asked me to come here to gain some benefits. I didn’t know that the Ji family eventually absorbed all the bloodline and souls of the royal family to refine the ghostly sword evil eye.”

Saintess Gu smiled bitterly. She was wondering if she should retreat now. Otherwise, if Qin Yu died, it would be her turn.

“Wang Feng, use the strongest formation to restrain the corpse of the Immortal Emperor to help me buy some time. I want to use the coffin!”

Qin Yu’s voice suddenly transmitted into the Sumeru ring.

“Don’t, big brother! It’s the corpse of the Immortal Emperor!” Wang Feng’s face was ashen.

“Everyone, get ready. We’re going all out.” Elder Guai comforted everyone loudly.

Qin Yu entered the Sumeru ring and kicked open the coffin lid. He then lifted the coffin out of the Sumeru ring with both hands.

After that, he poured the chaotic qi into it, and the coffin started revolving. A vast amount of ghostly qi suddenly emitted from it.

Almost instantly, Qin Yu noticed that his Sumeru ring had almost fallen into a sea of fire.

The terrifying vibration almost sent the Sumeru ring flying, and a large part of the space inside the Sumeru ring collapsed.Everyone please go to our official website . Countless black stripes appeared on the Sumeru ring on his finger. They represented the spatial rifts in the Sumeru ring.

“Hold on!”

At this moment, Qin Yu could no longer care less about the interior of the Sumeru ring. He brought the coffin and directly came in front of Ji Yuyi.

He then grabbed the coffin and charged at Ji Yuyi. Ji Yuyi waved his hand, and Mo Keyi immediately blocked in front of him.

The comb in her hand was like a knife, blocking in front. The hundreds of vengeful spirits instantly let out mournful howls and fiercely pushed against the coffin.

The tremendously cold and evil power clashed with the massive ghostly qi emitted by the coffin.

Instantly, the air at the center of the clash froze into countless pieces of ice that fell onto the ground.

That immense cold made Qin Yu unable to think. He could only silently watch the clash between the two.

A few seconds later, the coffin let out an angry roar that seemed to come from another world.

Amidst the black sound waves, a blurry phantom slowly appeared.

An unstoppable black ghostly qi rushed out again, and all the vengeful spirits suddenly started burning.

Mo Keyi’s body was also ignited with black flames. Ji Yuyi’s face instantly turned ashen, and she fell straight.

Meanwhile, the Immortal Emperor’s corpse in the Sumeru completely exploded.

Wang Feng activated countless powerful binding formations. Almost everyone injected their blood essence into them.

The spiritual energy in the Sumeru ring was exhausted in just a few seconds.

The Green Spirit Tree’s roots stabbed deeply into the space, resisting that world-destroying internal qi.

“Suppress!”

With a thought, Qin Yu instantly appeared in front of the immortal emperor in the Sumeru ring and then covered the corpse of the Immortal Emperor with the coffin.

“Boom!”

The Immortal Emperor’s corpse let out an angry howl. He seemed to have recognized the coffin that kept suppressing him.

In an instant, covered by the coffin, a palm slapped toward Qin Yu.

“Bind him!”

Veins bulged on Wang Feng’s face as an enormous formation emitted a dazzling light.

Countless massive spiritual energy chains shook violently and fiercely suppressed all parts of the Immortal Emperor’s corpse in that instant, reducing the power of his palm by at least half.

Singularity space!

Qin Yu waved his palm, and tens of thousands of spaces suddenly flipped.

The locust tree shield!

A massive locust wood block crashed from the sky and helped Qin Yu block part of the force.

“Boom!”

Almost instantly, the Immortal Emperor’s palm had broken through all the obstructions and smashed onto Qin Yu’s chest.

His entire body flew backward like a bomb, and in an instant, countless bones were broken.

Green Spirit Tree!

The Green Spirit Tree extended massive leaves, abruptly wrapping Qin Yu’s body and unleashing tremendous power to withstand the blow. Otherwise, this strike could have sent Qin Yu flying out of the Sumeru ring.

“Die!”

Jue Wu and Chang Mang grabbed the coffin lid and took the opportunity to close the lid.

Finally, the Immortal Emperor’s corpse calmed down.

“Ji Ao!”

Qin Yu grabbed a handful of green spirit fruits. These fruits were condensed when the Green Spirit Tree absorbed the Ji family’s ancestral space previously. He had always been reluctant to eat them but could no longer be bothered at this moment.
