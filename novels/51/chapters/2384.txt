In the distance, everyone from the Ni family activated the Ni Temple of Heaven and filled it with spiritual energy madly, preparing to attack again.

Meanwhile, the Yun family took out their family’s supreme treasure, the Heaven-sealing Orb, and completely sealed off the space outside.

The rest of the people also directly rushed forward, wanting to kill Qin Yu, not giving them any chance.

“Yan Ruoxue, it’s fine if you want to leave the Yan family, but we’ll drain your bloodline. Everything you have belongs to the Yan family.”

Yan Tianlong sneered coldly.

“Get lost!”

Qin Yu glanced at him indifferently.

The Soul Shattering Golden Radiance slashed out from his sea of consciousness, and the massive power made his face ashen.

A strand of divine sense power directly blasted onto his golden light.

Yan Guyun made a move again and saved Yan Tianlong.

Two divine senses exploded at the same time. The Soul Shattering Golden Radiance did not weaken and directly slashed Yan Tianlong’s body.

However, with Yan Guyun’s obstruction, the power was significantly reduced and no longer a threat to Yan Tianlong.

Yan Guyun grunted, his expression somewhat unnatural.

The clash of divine senses was the most dangerous. Once injured, it would take a long time to recover.

However, Qin Yu had the Soul Torment Mind Technique, and his divine sense power recovered rapidly. That was why he dared to use the divine sense attacks without fear.

“Mantis Stopping a Chariot. So what if you’ve cultivated the Glazed Holy Body? Do you think you can turn the tables against the power of our nine great aristocratic families?”

Ni Qian roared like a madman.

Qin Yu’s face turned deathly pale. Ni Qian was right. From the start of the battle, his every strike had to be full of utmost power.

The “nine by nine becoming one” just now, he had poured almost a quarter of the chaotic qi into Sul Lin to block a portion of the power of the Ni Temple of Heaven.

The eruption of the chaotic blood had caused all his bones to crack and his internal organs and divine sense to show signs of rupturing.

The Ni Temple of Heaven shone with multicolored light again. Under the preparation of everyone in the Ni family, the celestial artifact was ready to launch another attack.

“Prepare to die, Qin Yu!”

“Kill! Kill! Kill!”

Everyone from the Ni family let out furious roars and wanted to kill Qin Yu.

At this moment, the seven-colored light of the Ni Temple of Heaven suddenly changed again, turning into ten-colored light.

In an instant, a soaring emperor’s will swept through the entire space. The ten-colored light of the Ni Temple of Heaven actually pushed the Path of Heaven away again from a fist’s distance to a meter.

The space around the Ni Temple of Heaven shattered, and the true power of the celestial artifact began to awaken.

The Ni family’s cultivators controlling the celestial artifact almost instantly felt the destructive emperor might.

Other than a few with high cultivation, the others could not help but kneel. This was the submission expressed from the depths of their souls.

What was this?

Yan Tianshi’s eyes shone with shock!

The Path of Heaven had already begun to change! The Golden Path of Heaven had started to descend!

Almost simultaneously, in that boundless void, within many layers of overlapping and suppressing planes, the spatial pressure suddenly decreased.

Many hidden spaces and mystic realms suppressed in the boundless void suddenly burst out with shocking treasure light. Countless soaring qi surged from the entire Holy Region.

Among them, many ancient experts laughed wildly and prepared to take action.

These cultivators were all Tribulation Transcending Stage experts of the previous Path of Heaven. They had been rejected by the Path of Heaven and had been in retreat.

The Golden Path of Heaven descended, and the shackles on their bodies disappeared.

After tens of thousands of years in retreat, they could finally fly into the sky and jump into the sea!

Everyone was tremendously excited. A great era was about to arrive.

They could compete with the heavens and do whatever they wanted under the Golden Path of Heaven.

“Quickly control the celestial artifact to kill Qin Yu and then return to the family immediately!”

The head of the Ni family’s expression changed drastically as he shouted.

No one had expected the Golden Path of Heaven to descend at this moment.

Once it started, the suppression of the Path of Heaven would end completely after some time.

“Take out the celestial artifact and protect the surrounding in ten thousand miles.”

Yan Guyun said coldly.

Not only the Yan family, Si family, and Yao family, but also the Yun family who had long sealed off the surroundings using the Heaven-sealing Orb.

Almost all of the nine great aristocratic families took out their celestial artifacts because, at this moment, many powerful divine senses had locked onto this place.

These were all mighty realm cultivators from the previous Path of Heaven. Once they made a move, they would definitely turn the world upside down. Therefore, the nine great aristocratic families who had come to an agreement had already tacitly sealed off the entire space.

They had already divided the supreme treasures on Qin Yu’s body.

Yan Guyun’s body moved, and he again clapped his palms which had a shocking spatial power.

“You took one of my moves earlier on. Let’s see if your body can take it this time.”

As the suppression of the Path of Heaven reduced, the spatial power in his hand emitted an even more suffocating internal qi.

This attack was much more powerful than the previous one, revealing the power of the Way of Space he had comprehended.

Meanwhile, the Ni Temple of Heaven had launched another attack.

This practically disallowed Qin Yu to catch his breath, wanting to kill him completely.

In that instant, a blurry rune suddenly appeared in Qin Yu’s hand. The rune seemed to have been surrounded by countless clouds and mist, and no one could see it clearly.

Yan Guyun suddenly felt a sense of danger along with the appearance of the rune.

It was like the fear of primitive people toward fire, the fear of wild animals toward the unknown.

He even dared not land his attack on Qin Yu. Instead, he forcefully stopped it and retreated at an even faster speed.

Everyone within 10,000 meters noticed a tremendously strange phenomenon appearing in the surrounding space as the rune appeared.

“What’s going on?”

A cultivator roared in horror. He suddenly realized he had actually stepped through space when he exerted force under his feet.

As if stepping on an eggshell, one of his feet instantly sank into the void and was shattered by the violent void power.

“Come back!”

Fortunately, a cultivator beside him noticed it in time and pulled him back. Otherwise, he might have fallen into it.

As he exerted force, a large black hole appeared around him, instantly crushing his body.

All the cultivators noticed this situation. As their spiritual qi fluctuated, the space was as fragile as paper.

This place was near the Yan family. Numerous formations had been set up over the past tens of millions of years. Even the extreme power of the Path of Heaven could only tear open a space.

Other than that celestial artifact, it was impossible to create such a massive spatial rift.

“That rune has absorbed all the spatial power. Everyone, don’t use your spiritual power for the time being.”

Yan Guyun said coldly as he floated in the air.

He struck out thousands of spatial powers with both hands to temporarily stabilize this space.

What exactly was that rune?

At this moment, he looked at the rune with fear.
