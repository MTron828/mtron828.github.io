Chapter 1281: Chapter 1,281, fighting against Jin Lun! 

“That’s right, don’t forget that Big Brother still has a secret weapon.”

The few of them were mysterious, which made people suspicious.

At this moment, Qin Yu had already walked to the front of Jin Lun.

In front of Jin Lun’s huge body, Qin Yu appeared extremely small, only reaching the waist of Jin Lun.

The two figures formed a sharp contrast.

The other hunters also arrived one after another. The team leader took a step forward and said, “I can allow you to fight, but I only have one rule. No one is allowed to die. Do you understand?”

Jin Lun sneered and said, “Fists and feet have no eyes. Life and death are determined by fate.”

After saying that, he suddenly attacked again. That huge fist brought with it a sharp wind, directly approaching Qin Yu’s face!

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold. He no longer planned to hold back. The divine power in his entire body surged up at this moment and exploded on his fist!

Qin Yu held the divine power in his hand. His footsteps were light as he evaded Jin Lun’s huge fist. Then, he rose up from the ground and ruthlessly smashed his fist at Jin Lun’s Head!

Once this fist landed, even if it could not directly shatter Jin Lun’s head, it could still severely injure him!

“Internal Qi!”Jin Lun instantly felt a trace of danger, and his forehead instantly broke out in sweat!

At this moment, a golden armor suddenly flashed above Jin Lun’s head.

“It’s fire gold armor!”Someone exclaimed when he saw the origin of the golden armor.

“Rumor has it that Jin Lun spent a lot of money to create an armor. I’m afraid this is the fire gold armor!”

“Clang!”

Qin Yu’s fist fiercely smashed onto the fire-gold armor!

At the moment of contact, the fire-gold armor began to shatter, with cracks appearing one after another!

The powerful shock wave still made Jin Lun’s head feel an intense discomfort.

It was as if a heavy hammer had struck his head, causing him to feel dizzy.

Very soon, the fire-gold armor on his head completely exploded, turning into pieces that shot towards the trees at the side.

Wherever it passed, the trees were broken and the rocks crumbled. This was enough to witness the power of this punch!

Jin Lun rubbed his head, a trace of unease flashed across his face.

Qin Yu’s punch had actually directly shattered the fire-gold armor that he had spent a lot of money to forge!

God knows how much power this punch of his had!

Before Jin Lun could recover, Qin Yu had already clenched his fist once again and stood up.

This time, his attack was even fiercer, and his speed was extremely fast!

The two of them were already very close to each other, so there was no way for them to Dodge Now!

Helpless, Jin Lun could only clench his huge fist and attack Qin Yu as well!

“Boom!”

Two loud sounds rang out. Qin Yu’s fist pierced through Jin Lun’s chest, and Jin Lun’s fist also hit Qin Yu’s chest!

The only difference was that Qin Yu had only taken a few steps back, but a bloody hole had appeared in Jin Lun’s chest!

This result was beyond everyone’s imagination!

They had never expected that Jin Lun would fall into a disadvantageous position so quickly!

“This Qin Yu... is a little too powerful.”

“To be able to achieve such a level with just his physical body is simply unheard of!”

The team leader also revealed a shocked expression as he looked at Qin Yu with admiration.

As for Zhong Wu, he was even firmer in his thoughts!

This Qin Yu must be from a large sect! It was very likely that he was from the Heavenly Cloud sect!

“Good skill.”Jin Lun rubbed the bloody hole in his chest. Although his tone seemed relaxed, everyone knew in their hearts that he was already a little nervous.

Jin Lun took a deep breath and said coldly, “Your strength is stronger than I thought, but...”

“Cut the F * cking crap. Either you kneel down and admit defeat, or I will beat you until you kneel down.”Qin Yu interrupted Jin Lun’s words.

The words that Jin Lun wanted to ease were suddenly stuffed into his mouth, unable to say a word.

He gritted his teeth, his face somewhat embarrassed.

He was the one who instigated this matter, and now Qin Yu did not give him any face at all. He could no longer bring himself down.

“Hu.”Jin Lun let out a long breath, blowing the trees in the green rock forest until they rustled.

“Since that’s the case, then I can only go all out.”

The cold light in Jin Lun’s eyes grew more and more intense, and layers of light that were like mountain rocks and scales appeared on his body.

In a short moment, his entire body seemed to have turned into a stone man! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“It’s the stone transformation technique! Jin Lun’s Trump Card!”Someone exclaimed.

When the team leader saw this, he frowned.

“This Jin Lun... he actually used the stone transformation technique. Does he really want to fight to the death?”

He glanced at Jin Lun and then at Qin Yu before letting out a long sigh.

Things had already come to this, and it was no longer something he could control.

Jin Lun wasn’t the only one who wouldn’t give up. This Qin Yu didn’t seem to give him any face at all.

“Are you done? Are you done transforming? When you’re done transforming, I’m going to beat you up,”Qin Yu said with a cold smile.

His words were full of ridicule, but Jin Lun didn’t care.

He shook his palm, and a small blood bottle appeared in his hand.

The bottle was filled with dark red blood. Bubbles rose from time to time in the blood, as if it had a scorching temperature.

“I didn’t expect the Purple Phoenix Blood to be used on you at this time,”Jin Lun said coldly.

“Once I use the Purple Phoenix Blood, you must die!”

“No!”The team leader saw this and hurriedly shouted!

But it was obviously too late. Jin Lun grabbed the blood bottle and emptied it.

After swallowing the purple Phoenix Blood, Jin Lun’s stone-like body underwent another transformation.

The stone-like radiance on his body was dyed a bright red, flickering in the darkness.

“It’s actually the Purple Phoenix Blood! Rumor has it that after swallowing the purple Phoenix Blood, his physical body is comparable to a demonic beast!”

“It seems that Jin Lun is really tempted.”

“The overlapping of the Purple Phoenix Blood and the stone transformation technique, God knows how abnormal his body is!”
