Chapter 1632: Chapter 1,632-the fall of the southern region Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Rumor has it that this forbidden secret technique originated from the immortal slaying sect. In the vast northern lands, only one person knew about it, and that person was the master of the northern lands.

Rumor has it that this secret technique can step into the cycle of reincarnation and forcefully bring back a person’s divine sense.

As for whether it was real or fake, no one knew.

Xiao Sheng stood there for a long time before he gradually disappeared into the darkness. No one knew where he went.

...

After a few more days, the northern lands once again attacked.

This time, the master of the northern lands seemed to be even more powerful. People kept coming out of the nine holes, but in the end, they were all defeated by the elementalists.

The longer the time passed, the stronger the master of the northern lands became.

It was also because of this reason that Xiao Hai risked his life to enter the northern lands to stop the revival of the Master of the northern lands.

Even though he had failed, he had succeeded in allowing the northern Lord to revive for a longer period of time.

At the northern border.

A dense crowd of black-robed men stood behind the elementalist as though they were the victors.

The elementalist’s expression was ice-cold as the four great godly monarchs of the northern lands followed beside him.

“Lord, what should we do next?”Sima bei asked with a bow.

The elementalist replied coldly, “Occupy the southern region. Take in the capable and kill the weak.”

“What if those who are capable are not willing to listen to our orders?”Sima bei asked with a frown.

Upon hearing this, the elementalist immediately gave Sima bei a cold glance.

Sima Bei shuddered and hurriedly said, “Master, I understand.”

With a wave of the Elementalist’s large hand, a large group of black-robed men charged towards the southern region!

They first started from the various large sects and relied on their powerful spells to quickly occupy the various large sects and sects.

Meanwhile, the elementalists followed he teng back to Teng sect and temporarily stayed at Teng sect.

In just a few short days, most of the southern region had fallen.

Although everyone was unwilling, in order to save their lives, many people still chose to listen to the orders of the northern region and follow the orders of the northern region.

“Senior Xiao Hai, we don’t have your blood. We only want to live. I hope you can forgive us...”

Under the moonlight, someone was kneeling in the direction of Xiao Hai’s grave with tears streaming down his face.

Tianyun sect.

Even the powerful Tianyun sect was no exception.

The two godly monarchs personally brought people to the Tianyun sect and took it for themselves.

In the hall, the two godly monarchs were looking coldly at the deputy sect master.

One of the godly monarchs said, “The master said that the strong can stay and follow us in the northern lands. The weak will be killed.”

The other godly monarch said indifferently, “You are the deputy sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect. Normally, if you can control the Heavenly Cloud Sect, you should be kept. But I know that with your blood, you will definitely not listen to our orders.”

With that said, he suddenly raised his hand and grabbed the deputy sect master’s Neck!

“So... you should just die,”said the godly monarch coldly.

“Wait... Wait!”

At that moment, the deputy sect master spat out a sentence with great difficulty.

The godly monarch raised his brows and said, “Why, do you have something else to do?”

The deputy sect master said with great difficulty, “I... I am willing to listen to your orders...”

When these words were said, not only were the two godly monarchs astonished, but the entire heavenly cloud sect widened their eyes.

The deputy sect master had actually given in just like that? How was this possible?

One had to know that he had never given in when facing the Northern Land’s master previously!

“What trick are you playing with us?”The godly monarch said with a cold face.

The deputy sect master said bitterly, “I always thought that the sect master would come to repel you, but now it seems that it’s impossible.”

“He has disappointed me too much. Rather than that, it’s better to obey you.”

The Godly King was stunned, then laughed out loud, “That’s right, a wise man submits to circumstances!”

With that, he let go of the deputy sect master and reached out to pat his shoulder. He seemed to be quite satisfied with the deputy sect master’s performance.

And the deputy sect master naturally had a motive for doing so.

Only if the Tianyun sect was still under his control could he ensure the survival of the Tianyun sect.

Moreover, Di Zun was in closed-door cultivation. With his personality, he would never submit to the northern lands.

The submissiveness of the deputy sect master undoubtedly made the northern lands more powerful.

Many sects that were resisting immediately lost hope when they heard this news.

For a time, countless sects were firmly controlled by the northern lands. Although there were still a few sects that were unwilling to submit, the final outcome was extremely miserable.

Near the Tianyun sect.

Boss Zheng’s restaurant.

Ding Yi was secretly planning something with a few young people.

“Sister Ding, even the deputy sect leader has surrendered. Is there a need for us to continue?”Asked a young man.

Ding Yi snorted lightly, “Just because he has no backbone doesn’t mean that we have no backbone!”

“Forget it. Now that the entire South Province has fallen, who would be willing to take the risk? What can we do with just the few of us?”Another young man snorted lightly.

Ding Yi glared at him and berated, “What do you mean the entire southern region has fallen! Have you all forgotten the death of our ancestor, Xiao Hai?”

“That’s right. Senior Xiao Hai is already dead. How many Xiao Hai are there in the world?”The person beside him laughed bitterly. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Qin Yu’s face could not help but appear in Ding Yi’s mind.

She clenched her fist and said, “At least Qin Yu will not surrender. He will definitely become our new spiritual leader!”

The young people looked at each other and didn’t say anything.

“Everyone listen to my orders. We must do our best to resist the northern lands!”Ding Yi clenched his fists and said.

“From today onwards, we will be called Qin Yu’s squad!”

...

Artifact-refining city.

At this moment, Qin Yu knew nothing about this.

And the entire artifact-refining city was like a paradise, leaving a pure land in this chaotic world.

These few days, almost every day, people came to watch Qin Yu’s cultivation, and Xiaocao was no exception.

Soon, the flame of this abandoned pool began to lose its effect.

Qin Yu slowly opened his eyes, and when he saw the scene in front of him, he couldn’t help but be a little surprised.

“Xiaocao, what... What’s going on?”Qin Yu exclaimed.

Without waiting for Xiaocao to reply, the person next to him said excitedly, “Qin Yu, your body is too magical. It’s simply a good seedling for weapon refining!”

“Yes, using the purple-red Heaven Flame to refine your body is unheard of!”

Xiao Cao hurriedly explained, “They are all here to see you...”

Qin Yu was slightly embarrassed. He knew that there were people coming to watch, but he did not expect so many people to come!

“Masters, I happen to have a question to ask everyone. Is it convenient for everyone?”Qin Yu sat in the abandoned pool and cupped his hands.

At this time, someone smiled and said, “Ask away. As long as we know, we will tell you everything we know!”

Qin Yu cupped his hands and thanked him. Then, he said, “In this weapon refining city, who is the best at forging weapons?”

Hearing this, everyone immediately started chattering.

“Of course it’s Master Zhengyang. He is the number one master in our weapon refining city!”

“Master Zhengyang...”Qin Yu silently memorized this name.

An extremely crazy idea popped up in his mind! That was to treat his body as a divine weapon and let the refiners refine it!
