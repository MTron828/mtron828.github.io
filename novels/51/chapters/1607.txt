Yong Ji frowned at Rui Yi’s miserable state.

It was obvious that Rui Yi must have experienced inhuman torture. Otherwise, he would not be in such a miserable state.

Yong Ji looked at he teng subconsciously, but he teng did not seem to care at all.

Yong Ji walked quickly to Rui Yi, raised his palm, and spread the internal Qi into Rui Yi’s body.

As the spiritual Qi entered his body, Rui Yi’s consciousness finally recovered a little.

“How is he? He won’t die, will he?”Yong Ji said with a frown.

Rui Yi sat up from the ground. When she saw he teng in front of her, her eyes were filled with fear and anger.

“Yong Ji, i order you to kill him!”Rui Yi grabbed Yong Ji’s arm and roared angrily.

However, Yong Ji reprimanded, “Enough, don’t embarrass yourself. I really don’t know what the godly monarch sees in you.”

Rui Yi seemed to have gone mad as he roared furiously, “I want you to kill him! Kill this bastard!”

He Teng ignored Rui Yi completely. He put his hands behind his back and said calmly, “I have already returned him to you. I hope you can do what you promised me.”

Yong Ji grunted in gratitude. Although he was angry at He Teng, he did not lose his mind like Rui Yi.

After that, Yong Ji said goodbye to he teng and left with Rui Yi.

After leaving Teng Gate, Rui Yi’s face was still filled with madness.

Yong Ji looked at the black-robed man next to him and said coldly, “Take her back to the north, you disgrace!”

The black-robed man hummed in gratitude. He ignored Rui Yi’s crazy roar and forcefully brought her away from the place.

Yong Ji had his hands behind his back and a vicious expression appeared on his face.

“Qin Yu, since you’re not coming out, then I’ll kill Wen Wanyi First!”Yong Ji said coldly.

With that, his body shook and he disappeared into thin air.

In the next few days.

The Southern Region was deathly silent.

Qu Zhu, Jue Wu, and monk Hongxi were all severely injured, which made the cultivators of the southern region even more terrified and uneasy.

A few days later, Yong Ji released another piece of news:

“Since Qin Yu hasn’t shown up yet, let Wen wanye come to his death. If he wants to be a coward, then don’t blame me for starting a massacre!”

As soon as this news was released, the many sects immediately felt extremely uneasy.

This was because they knew very well in their hearts that the cultivators of their sect were much stronger than rogue cultivators.

As far as the northern lands were concerned, the first choice would definitely be the various large sects.

The various sect leaders of the various sects had gathered together and were planning to discuss how to deal with this.

These sect leaders, who had once been extremely glorious in the southern province, now had pale expressions and were feeling uneasy.

“I really didn’t expect that no one would be able to stand out in the vast southern region.”A sect leader sighed.

“That’s right. What’s even more troublesome is that the ones who attacked were all the top people in the southern region.”

“Xiao Hai Jue Wu’s life and death are unknown. There’s also no news of Qu Zhu and monk Hong Xi. Who else can resist the northern lands...”

“If it really can’t be done, we can only surrender to the enemy.”A sect leader sighed.

“Surrender to the enemy? I’ll surrender to his grandpa. Not long ago, my son was traveling outside and died tragically at the hands of the northlanders. Even if I self-destruct, I won’t let them off!”A sect leader from another sect said furiously.

“Do you think I’m Willing? If it weren’t for the fact that there’s no other way, who would be willing to bear the blame!”

For a time, both sides argued endlessly, each with their own opinions.

Many elders gathered together again.

The deputy sect master’s face was as dark as water, and so were many elders.

“If this continues, the South Province will sooner or later completely fall,”an elder said coldly.

At this time, what they cared about was not the sect, but the life and death of individuals.

With the character of the northern lands, once they completely entered the South Province, everyone would become their nourishment.

After all, the weaker cultivators of the northern lands had all died at their hands, let alone the southern region.

“I wonder where the sect leader has gone to. He still hasn’t shown himself,”the vice sect leader said in a deep voice.

“If the sect leader was here, they wouldn’t have the chance to be so impudent!”An elder slammed the table and stood up.

“I do have an idea,”Di Zun suddenly said.

Everyone’s eyes fell on Di Zun as if they were waiting for his next words.

Di zun said slowly, “Although the sect master has been traveling for a long time, it doesn’t mean that the sect master’s influence has disappeared. As long as the sect master is not dead, the deterrence will still exist.”

Then, Di Zun narrowed his eyes and said, “Vice sect master, why don’t we send a message that the sect master has returned?”

Hearing this, everyone in the meeting hall was shocked.

“But... what if someone comes to check out the truth?”An elder asked in puzzlement.

Di Zun said in a deep voice, “Ordinary cultivators don’t need the sect master’s help. As for Yongji and the others... we can only pray that they don’t have the courage.”

The scene fell into silence. After a while, the vice head said in a deep voice, “This is indeed a solution, but it’s not a long-term solution.”

“It doesn’t need to be long-term. We just need to hold on until my master comes back,”said Di Zun.

This master was naturally referring to Qin Yu.

Di Zun had an inexplicable confidence in Qin Yu.

After a series of discussions, this idea was finally agreed upon by everyone.

...

On the Immortal Chuan Mountain, Yongji was sitting cross-legged, quietly waiting for Wen Wanji or Qin Yu’s arrival.

Time passed by minute by minute, and in the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

During these three days, although Yong Ji didn’t leave Immortal Chuan Mountain, he had information about the South Province in his hands. Almost every day, people came to report.

“Where did this Qin Yu Go?”Yong Ji murmured.

He felt a bit uneasy. Every time Qin Yu disappeared, it would bring a great increase in strength.

At this moment, a black-robed man suddenly appeared beside Yong Ji.

“The reaction of the South Province cultivators really surprised us,”said the black-robed man.

“Many cultivators chose to self-detonate. Our people also suffered different degrees of injuries, and many people even died.”

Hearing this, Yong Ji subconsciously glanced at Xiao Hai’s tombstone.

“This is the greatness of him, Xiao Hai.”Yong Ji’s tone was both displeased and disdainful.

After that, Yong Ji stood up from the ground. He stretched his body and said indifferently, “It seems that that dog, Qin Yu, is really afraid. Since he doesn’t dare to come out to fight, then don’t blame me for starting a massacre.”

At this moment, the black-robed man beside him said in a deep voice, “There’s still one more piece of news that I haven’t told you.”

“What News?”Yong Ji didn’t seem to mind.

The black-robed man said in a deep voice, “Rumor has it that the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect has returned and is currently in the Heavenly Cloud Sect.”

“What? !”

Hearing this, Yong Ji’s expression immediately became somewhat unnatural, and his brows furrowed into a ball.
