Chapter 733: Granny Qin Came Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Seeing the smile on Tang Sheng’s face spreading, Qin Yu finally let out a sigh of relief.

This father and son were really the same. They both liked to be praised.

Tang Sheng also seemed to feel a bit embarrassed. He coughed and said with a serious expression, “Although what you said is true, you should know what these ten-thousand-year-old herbs mean.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly.

It was simply impossible to get him to give up the herbs just by flattering him.

The final decisive factor in the negotiation was still the value of each other’s use, which was individual ability.

Tang Sheng said in a deep voice, “If I give this herb to you, what benefits will I get?”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “I’m an apothecary. I can refine medicine for you, no matter what kind of medicine it is.”

Tang Sheng waved his hand and shook his head, “That’s not enough.”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Mr. Tang, please state your conditions. As long as I can do it, I won’t refuse.”

Tang Sheng picked up the teacup and took a sip. He then looked at Qin Yu and said, “First, you have to refine the medicine for me three times.”

“No problem.” Qin Yu agreed without thinking.

“Second, you have to serve the Tang family for three years,” said Tang Sheng.

Qin Yu frowned.

Serve the Tang family for three years? What did that mean?

“Mr. Tang, I’m not sure what you mean,” said Qin Yu with a frown.

Tang Sheng smiled nonchalantly and said, “To put it bluntly, you’ll be the Tang family’s helper. If anything happens to the Tang family in the next three years, you must drop everything at hand and come to the Tang family.”

Qin Yu was a bit surprised. No wonder the Tang family was so strong and prosperous. It seemed that they relied on this method to obtain the help of many martial artists.

“Alright, I promise you.” Qin Yu nodded.

“Alright, it’s settled then. The Tang family won’t touch this 10,000-year-old herb,” said Tang Sheng with a smile

Upon hearing Tang Sheng’s words, Qin Yu didn’t say anything for a long time as an awkward expression flashed across his face.

“What?” Seeing Qin Yu’s expression, Tang Sheng frowned.

Qin Yu coughed and said, “If it’s convenient for Mr. Tang, I wonder if you can lend me some manpower.”

As soon as he said this, Tang Sheng’s expression immediately darkened.

“What do you mean? You want the Tang family to snatch the herbs for you?” Tang Sheng seemed a bit angry.

Qin Yu forced a smile and said, “Mr. Tang, please don’t be angry. This is just a request of mine.”

“No way!” Tang Sheng snorted coldly. “If the Tang family has to help you, we won’t need you at all! Why don’t I just give you a herb?”

Having no other choice, Qin Yu could only nod in embarrassment.

However, an important message could be heard from Tang Sheng’s words.

The Tang family had more than one 10,000-year-old herb.

Such a resource was top-notch even in the whole country.

After saying goodbye to Tang Sheng, Qin Yu got up and left the teahouse.

After Qin Yu left the house, Tang Mo came up to him.

“How was it? Did my dad promise you?” Asked Tang Mo.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Yes, but..., it’s nothing.”

Tang Mo frowned and said, “What’s wrong? You’re stammering like a woman. If you have something to say, just say it.”

Qin Yu eventually shook his head and didn’t say anything.

After leaving the Tang family, Qin Yu had been thinking of countermeasures.

This ten-thousand-year-old herbs incident would definitely attract countless people to fight over it, including foreign forces.

If the Hong Yi Sect could get the news, the others could also get the news.

Qin Yu was determined to get this herb. Otherwise, he would have no chance of winning against Blackie.

He returned to the vicinity of the villa. Just as Qin Yu was about to enter, he suddenly saw a familiar figure!

He saw Granny Qin on the beach with eight purple-robed men beside her!

“Oh no!” Qin Yu’s expression changed when he saw this!

As expected, Granny Qin had also received the news.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to dwell on it. He quickly returned to the villa and closed the door.

“What’s wrong? Why do you have such an expression?” Xiao Yu asked casually.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He rubbed his chin and frowned.

Granny Qin was at the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm. Even she had eight purple-robed men with her, let alone him?

“The Hong Yi Sect only sent two people. They obviously don’t want to help me,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Obviously, the Hong Yi Sect was just putting on an act. They didn’t want to get involved in this mess.

“If Granny Qin gets that ten-thousand-year-old herbs, then it will be really troublesome.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but gasp!

If Granny Qin gave this ten-thousand-year-old herbs to Blackie to consume, then wouldn’t Blackie have a chance to improve further?

The more he thought about it, the more afraid he became!

Qin Yu suddenly stood up from the sofa!

“No! No matter what, we can’t let these herbs fall into Granny Qin’s hands!” Qin Yu frowned tightly.

After thinking about it, Qin Yu finally decided to turn to the Tang family.

As the local overlord, the Tang family wouldn’t be afraid of Granny Qin at all.

The fact that Tang Mo held a banquet with more than 20 Martial Marquis accompanying him was enough to prove their strength!

Qin Yu took out his phone. He originally wanted to call Tang Mo, but he had just left the Tang family, so it wasn’t appropriate to make a call now.

Therefore, Qin Yu temporarily suppressed this impulse.

The next day.

Qin Yu went out for a walk.

He could clearly feel that there were many martial artists living nearby, and every one of them was at the Martial Marquis Realm.

Obviously, these people were all here for the herbs.

This made Qin Yu even more anxious.

That night, Qin Yu took out his cell phone and called Tang Mo to treat him to a meal and ask him for help.

After the call was connected, Qin Yu expressed his intention.

Tang Mo said on the other end, “There’s no need for a meal. I’ve already finished eating. If you have nothing else to do, come and play with me.”

Qin Yu agreed. “Okay, where are you?”

Tang Mo said, “I’m at the Island Grand Meeting.”

Although Qin Yu didn’t know what this place was, he still agreed.

After hanging up the phone, Qin Yu hurriedly left the house.

He casually hailed a cab and rushed to this Island Grand Meeting.

Just as he got into the car, someone not far away noticed Qin Yu.

“Granny Qin, that person seems to be Qin Yu,” a purple-robed person said coldly. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Upon hearing this, Granny Qin’s expression changed slightly.

“Qin Yu? Are you sure?” Granny Qin said with a frown.

The purple-robed person said in a deep voice, “I’m 90% sure.”

Granny Qin narrowed her eyes sand snorted coldly. “It seems that Qin Yu is also here for the herbs! No wonder he said such arrogant words in public. It turns out that he wants to rely on this herb to turn the tables!”

“Granny Qin, what should we do now?” a purple-robed man asked.

Granny Qin snorted coldly. “Since I’ve discovered him, how can I let him succeed? Everyone, chase after him immediately!”
