After the phone call ended, Qin Yu looked at Mr. Zhang and said indifferently, “Your president will be here soon.”

“Pfft!”

Mr. Zhang couldn’t hold back his laughter for a moment.

“Do you know how much of a big shot our president is? Do you know how many people he meets every day?” Mr. Zhang sneered.

“You don’t even know how to bluff convincingly. Look at the way you dress. Do you think you’re worthy enough to mention our bank president?”

Even Li Yan, who was standing at the side, frowned.

This guy was too unreliable.

He said that he knew the president of the largest bank in Chuzhou?

“Qin Yu, let’s hurry up and leave...” Song Wei looked extremely scared and kept urging Qin Yu.

Qin Yu was unfazed and sat there quietly while waiting.

In the blink of an eye, five minutes had passed.

Mr. Zhang was slightly impatient and shouted, “Alright, I don’t have time to play around with you! Where are the security guards?! Throw these people out quickly!”

Four to five security guards rushed in from outside the door. They looked at Qin Yu aggressively.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. These security guards were naturally no match for him.

However, he would be causing trouble for Mr. Wei by getting violent here.

“Hurry up and drag him out!” Mr. Zhang shouted.

The security guards walked over to Qin Yu without saying a word.

“All of you, stop!”

At this moment, Wei Jiang pushed open the door and entered!

He clasped his legs and was panting heavily. Beads of sweat were dripping down his face.

Mr. Zhang was stunned when he saw Wei Jiang.

He hurriedly walked over and said with a sheepish smile, “President, why are you here?”

Wei Jiang gave Mr. Zhang a cold glance and didn’t say anything.

Then, Wei Jiang walked in front of Qin Yu and said apologetically, “Mr. Qin, I’m really sorry that such a thing happened. As the president, I should take responsibility...”

“You’re too courteous, Mr. Wei,” Qin Yu said.

Seeing this scene, Mr. Zhang was immediately terrified! His face paled!

This guy really knew the bank president?

And the bank president’s attitude towards him... was deferential?

“You, pack your things and get out of here immediately!” Wei Jiang turned around and pointed at Mr. Zhang.

Hearing this, Mr. Zhang immediately panicked.

He had been in the Chuzhou Bank for many years and had made a lot of money.

His high salary enabled him to take out loans to buy countless cars and houses.

If he was fired, his life would be over!

Thinking of this, Mr. Zhang fell to his knees with a plop and begged desperately, “Mr. Wei, I was wrong. On account of my many years of work, please spare me...”

Wei Jiang pushed Mr. Zhang’s hand away and said coldly, “You’ve already been complained about countless times. Haven’t you learned your lesson? A person like you can’t work for our bank! Get lost immediately!”

Mr. Zhang’s face was ashen. At this time, he suddenly ran to Qin Yu and hugged Qin Yu’s thigh as he begged bitterly, “I was ignorant. Please help me plead for mercy. I really know I was wrong...”

Qin Yu sneered as he said, “I’ve already given you a chance.”

“Security, throw him out!” Wei Jiang waved his hand impatiently.

A few security guards quickly walked forward and forcefully dragged Mr. Zhang out of the office.

Li Yan and Song Wei were stunned. They never thought that Qin Yu had such influence!

“Why didn’t you say earlier that you have such a powerful friend...” Li Yan said somewhat awkwardly.

Song Wei whispered, “I don’t know either. We haven’t seen each other for a long time...” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Mr. Qin, let’s go back to the office,” Wei Jiang looked at Qin Yu and said.

Qin Yu nodded and smiled as he said, “Okay.”

When the two of them reached the door, Qin Yu suddenly stopped in his tracks.

He turned around and pointed at Song Wei as he said, “Mr. Wei, this is my classmate. She is highly educated and is morally upright.”

Wei Jiang glanced at Song Wei and smiled. “Really? Our bank will never let such a talent slip through our fingers!”

Hearing this, Song Wei immediately jumped up in excitement.

She quickly bowed and said, “Thank you, Mr. Wei!”

Then, Qin Yu and Wei Jiang walked into the bank manager’s office.

Wei Jiang’s office wasn’t luxurious, but quite minimalistic.

The bookshelves were filled with flowers and plants. It was obvious that Wei Jiang was a very tasteful person.

“Mr. Qin, according to the agreement, Shen Yun will come to apply for a loan at nine in the morning.” Wei Jiang personally poured a glass of water for Qin Yu.

Qin Yu took a deep breath. He felt a sense of anticipation in his heart.

Qin Yu really wanted to know what this person who thought himself to be high and mighty would feel like when trampled under his feet.

“Mr. Qin, may I ask what your relationship with Miss Yan is?” At this moment, Wei Jiang suddenly asked tentatively.

At the mention of Yan Ruoxue, Qin Yu’s face couldn’t help but blush slightly, and the corners of his mouth rose into a smile.

“I can’t reveal it.” Qin Yu shook his head and said.

Seeing Qin Yu’s reaction, Wei Jiang laughed loudly and said, “I understand. No wonder Miss Yan cares so much about you.”

At this point, Wei Jiang came forward and whispered, “Miss Yan called me last night.”

Qin Yu was stunned and hurriedly asked, “She called you? What did she say?”
