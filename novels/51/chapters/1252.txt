Chapter 1253: Chapter 1,253, shattering the void with a single punch! 

Qin Yu once again grabbed zi he in his hand.

Just when everyone thought that Qin Yu was going to give in, he suddenly attacked, making zi he unable to move!

“I told you, How Could Qin Yu be the one who gave in?”Someone muttered softly.

Elder Bai, Zi Ru, and the others all had ashen faces as they took a step forward.

“What are you doing!”Zi Ru berated coldly.

Qin Yu grabbed zi he with one hand and sneered, “Didn’t you not admit defeat? Fine, then I’ll beat you until you admit defeat.”

With that, Qin Yu once again swung his palm, continuously slapping at Zi He’s face.

Zi He, who was already severely injured, had his face shattered under this barrage of slaps. It was a tragic sight.

“Brat, Stop!”Zi Ru shouted as she slapped her palm forward.

Qin Yu raised his hand to receive the slap without hesitation.

With a loud bang, both palms received a fierce collision.

Zi Ru was sent flying under the immense force, and the bones in her hands were broken!

Qin Yu sneered, “Do you think you can stop me?”

After sending Zi Ru flying, Qin Yu slapped Zi He’s face again.

“Stop!”Elder Bai shouted.

He took a step forward and said coldly, “I told you to stop, did you hear me?”

Qin Yu glanced at elder Bai and sneered, “You told me to stop, so I have to stop? Who Do you think you are? What are you shouting for?”

Elder Bai’s face turned livid. He glared at Qin Yu and shouted, “Kid, do you know what you are talking about?”

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered with elder Bai. He kept slapping zi he’s face.

“You are courting death!”

Elder Bai shouted angrily and suddenly attacked!

He moved his hand and a five-colored sharp blade appeared in the air in front of Qin Yu!

This blade was as if it had descended from the heavens. It was extremely luxurious, carrying a trace of internal Qi and a dangerous aura. It was extremely terrifying.

However, Qin Yu did not even turn his head. Instead, he clenched his fist and smashed it down with a bang.

The sharp blade that shot out from the void was directly shattered by Qin Yu’s punch!

Elder Bai seemed to have suffered a backlash as he took two steps back!

This caused everyone’s expression to change drastically!

Elder Bai’s strength was self-evident and incomparably terrifying, but he was actually forced back a few steps by a person without spiritual energy? ? ! How was this possible? ! !

“I... I admit defeat, I admit defeat...”

Zi He, who was caught by Qin Yu, finally couldn’t take it anymore.

If this continued, he would definitely lose his life here.

Qin Yu threw zi he out and then looked at elder Bai coldly, saying, “Do you hear me clearly now? He has already admitted defeat.”

Elder Bai’s eyes narrowed slightly, saying, “If you had spoken nicely, perhaps I could have shown mercy and brought you to the Holy Region.”

“But you little bastard don’t know your place and even injured zi he and Zi Ru! What crime should you commit!”

Having said that, Qin Yu knew clearly in his heart that his face had already been torn. There was no need to spoil him too much.

Therefore, Qin Yu took a step forward and said coldly, “Old Bastard, do you have a mouth or an anus on your face? You Don’t know how to speak, you only know how to spit shit out, right? If you are not convinced, just come out and fight!”

A flash of anger flashed across elder Bai’s face. His white hair danced wildly in the wind, and every wrinkle on his face was trembling.

“You’re just a good-for-nothing without any spiritual power. Do you really think you’re worth anything?”Elder Bai said darkly.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Come, come here. See if I’ll slap you or not.”

Elder Bai was not stupid. He knew clearly in his heart that Qin Yu’s body was full of oddities. Once he was approached, he would definitely not have a good ending.

Thus, he braced himself and prepared to pull away at any moment.

“What are you nervous about?”Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and asked.

“The eighteen array platforms are all in my hands. Do you believe that I won’t let you go back?”

Hearing these words, the faces of the people from the holy region all turned ugly.

If they were to stay on Earth forever, it would definitely be an unacceptable tragedy.

“Go to hell!”

At this moment, a loud shout came from behind Qin Yu!

Qin Yu felt a sinister killing intent coming from behind him. He turned around and saw Zi he holding a black treasured sword and stabbing it viciously at Qin Yu’s back! Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

This sword was a gift from the sect and was incomparably sharp. It could split even a huge mountain in half in an instant. Its sharpness was immeasurable!

In addition to Zi He’s sneak attack, he arrived in front of Qin Yu in the blink of an eye. Even Qin Yu didn’t have time to react.

“Puchi!”

The sword pierced into Qin Yu’s back, making a soft sound.

“Master!”

“Mr. Qin!”

Seeing this scene, Di Zun and the others’expressions changed drastically!

But after the sword pierced another centimeter, it couldn’t go any deeper!

No matter how hard Zihe tried, the sword did not move at all.

Qin Yu turned his head to look at the Crazy Zihe, and a cold killing intent appeared on his face.

“Do you really think that I don’t dare to kill you?”Qin Yu’s voice sounded as if it came from hell, and it was extremely cold!

Meanwhile, Zihe was also panicking. Fear flashed through his eyes, and his mouth was slightly open, and the muscles on his face were twisted.

Qin Yu grabbed the treasured sword in one go, and then his arm ruthlessly smashed towards the treasured sword.

With a “Kacha”sound, the treasured sword bestowed by the sect was actually directly shattered into two pieces by Qin Yu’s arm!

“Zi He, run!”Elder Bai hurriedly shouted.

Zi He’s expression changed, and his body hurriedly disappeared into the void.

But How Could Qin Yu give him a chance? Such a short distance, no matter how great one’s ability was, they wouldn’t be able to escape from Qin Yu’s hands!

Qin Yu clenched his fist, containing his divine power and fury within. Then, he ruthlessly smashed towards the void in front of him!

“Kacha!”

Something shocking happened!

Qin Yu’s punch directly shattered the void!

Those patches of space shattered like broken glass!
