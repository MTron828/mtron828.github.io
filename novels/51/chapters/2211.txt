2212 Bargaining

However, the Reversion Void Stage black-striped tigers had a good tacit understanding of their coordination.

The moment their companions fell, more black-striped tigers would always use the space their companions had obtained to attack. Under the tremendous impact, Chang Hu and Feng were covered in blood.

Qin Yu, on the other hand, formed a line word formula with his hand, and his movement was tremendously fast.

He found the right opportunity to punch and kick, and one black-striped tiger would always fall.

“Roar!”

A heaven-shaking roar came from the darkness. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Along with this roar, a visible fluctuation spread through the air.

“Watch out for the Divine Sense Attack! This Tiger King has innate cultivation technique!”

Wu Mei screamed.

Before she finished speaking, a terrifying tremor transmitted into Qin Yu’s divine sense.

In an instant, his sea of consciousness seemed smashed by a gigantic hammer. The already injured figurine of his divine sense became even dimmer.

He spat a mouthful of blood! In an instant, four or five black-striped tigers pounced on Qin Yu’s body. One of them even directly swallowed Qin Yu’s upper body.

With a clang, the tiger’s mouth seemed to have bitten on iron and stone, and the gigantic tiger’s teeth directly shattered.

Qin Yu grabbed that black-striped tiger, and with a slight force from his arms, the entire black-striped tiger was torn into two halves.

Chang Hu and Feng were also in tremendously bad condition. Under the mental attack just now, their divine sense was greatly shaken.

And the black-striped tigers had left deep wounds on their bodies that even their bones could be seen. Wu Mei had helped block most of the mental energy attacks and had fainted on the ground at this moment.

“Attack! Don’t let it use any more Divine Sense Attack.”

Chang Hu roared in rage. His entire body shot into the depths of the forest like a cannonball. Feng hurriedly followed.

Qin Yu stood beside Wu Mei to prevent the remaining black-striped tigers from attacking her.

“Can they win?”

Qin Yu frowned and looked into the depths.

“In terms of strength, Chang Hu and Feng combined are definitely stronger than the Tiger King. However, the black-striped Tiger King has awakened the power of its bloodline. Their cultivation technique comes from inheritance. This kind of cultivation technique is even more terrifying than a human’s. I can’t judge this Tiger King’s strength either!”

Qin Yu nodded. This bloodline awakening was similar to a True Saint comprehending the power of rules.

Just like Qin Yu, he had comprehended the power of destruction, and in the face of the power of tribulation, he could actually survive. It was almost unbelievable!

Another terrifying tremor came from the depths of the forest. The tremendous tiger roar shook Qin Yu’s head until he felt dizzy.

“Qin Yu, go help them! I’m afraid the two can’t withstand it.”

Wu Mei’s expression changed drastically.

“Alright. You take care of yourself then.”

Qin Yu frowned and said.

His body moved and flashed toward the place the fluctuations came from.

A giant tiger with black and gold fur appeared in front of him. Its hundreds of meters long body made Qin Yu’s figure almost invisible.

The blood-red mouth suddenly opened, and a spherical fluctuation gathered in front of it.

Chang Hu and Feng were lying on the ground, their bodies full of wounds. The battle just now seemed to have caused them severe injuries.

“Shut your mouth!”

Qin Yu leaped high and kicked the tiger’s nose.

The tremendous force directly kicked the black-striped tiger’s nose to be crooked, and the tiger that was hundreds of meters long was sent flying.

Countless giant trees were smashed into pieces by the gigantic tiger.

“F*ck, is it that abnormal?” Chang Hu was dumbfounded.

The Black Tiger King bounced from the ground, and its gigantic body smashed toward Qin Yu like a mountain.

The tremendous force caused Qin Yu’s hair to fly backward wildly.

“Come on, let me see how capable you are.”

Qin Yu stretched out a hand and directly met that shocking tiger pounce with a palm.

The hill-sized tiger claw directly met Qin Yu’s palm. The terrifying power directly shook and collapsed the ground around Qin Yu for a few meters.

Qin Yu’s expression was cold as he grabbed the tiger claw.

The hundred-meter-long tiger body spun in his hand and smashed out the following moment.

In the following moment, Qin Yu stomped on the air and appeared on top of the black-striped tiger’s head like lightning.

He stomped his foot forward and was about to crush the Tiger King’s head.

“Spare me! Your Majesty! I’m willing to be your little brother. Don’t kill me!”

The tiger transformed into a middle-aged man and knelt to beg for mercy.

“He even does that!”

Qin Yu was dumbfounded. It was the first time he had come across such a situation.

“I cultivated for over a thousand years before I gained intelligence. I beg you, Your Majesty, not to kill me, and I will agree to anything.”

The man knelt and touched the ground with the forehead in worship repeatedly.

“What I want is your inner core. I don’t need a little brother now.”

Qin Yu shook his head.

Who knew what this Tiger King was thinking? Who knew if it would instantly attack him with a mental attack? His current physical condition could not withstand it.

“There are three inner cores in my acupuncture points. One was left behind by my mother, one by a human cultivator, and the last by the heavenly leopard which had invaded my territory! I’ll give them all to you.”

The man knelt and touched the ground with the forehead in worship repeatedly.

“Is what you said true?”

Qin Yu frowned and said.

“It’s absolutely true. I wouldn’t dare to lie to Your Majesty.”

The black-striped tiger said repeatedly,

Qin Yu was delighted and said, “Alright. You use three golden cores to exchange for your life. If you dare to lie to me, I’ll directly twist your head off.”

“You guys pack up these tiger skins first. I’ll go with this Tiger King.”

Qin Yu said to Chang Hu.

“Big brother, be more careful. These Demonic Beasts are cunning and treacherous. They might be setting a trap for you to jump in. However, you’re powerful, so you shouldn’t be afraid of it!”

Chang Hu reminded him.

“Alright. If anything goes wrong, I’ll kill it immediately.”

Qin Yu looked at the tiger shadow and nodded.

The temptation of three golden cores was not small. They could accomplish almost one-third of the mission.

The man and the tiger walked to a den. The clear water and green lotuses in it were in sharp contrast with the stench of the swamp outside.

“You really know how to enjoy yourself!”

Qin Yu said to the Tiger King.

“No, no, haha!”

The man smiled awkwardly and waved his hands repeatedly. His buttocks swayed as if he was wagging his tail.

When he walked into the depths of the den, a few tigers the size of calves came forth and rubbed on his body.

“Hahaha, scratch your tongue!”

The man transformed into a giant tiger and stuck out his tongue to lick the cubs.

Several cubs squeaked and were having a great time.

“Cough! Cough! Brother Tiger, did you forget something important?”

Qin Yu coughed lightly a few times.

“Your Majesty, these are three inner cores. Sorry!”

The black-striped tiger bit three fist-sized inner cores and placed them in Qin Yu’s hand.

He looked at Qin Yu pitifully and said, “You’ve promised to spare my life.”

“Don’t worry. Haha!”

Qin Yu laughed out loud. This Tiger King was like a dog.

He suddenly realized that once Demonic Beasts gained intelligence, they were actually similar to humans.

He really did not expect such a bargaining move.

“Swoosh!”

A cold light flashed past, and the enormous tiger head was suddenly beheaded.

Another sword flew out, and the five cubs were instantly chopped into several pieces.

Who was it?

Qin Yu’s expression suddenly changed drastically.
