Chapter 543: Yan Ruoxue Was Taken Away Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The Pavilion Master’s opinion was the same as Jiang He’s.

After Qin Yu forcefully entered the Martial Marquis realm, he almost crushed Han Wei.

And Han Wei not only possessed the Han family’s cultivation techniques, but also possessed the inheritance of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

Even under such advantageous conditions, he was still defeated by Qin Yu, so an ordinary Martial Marquis wouldn’t be a threat to Qin Yu.

The two returned to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion together.

Qin Yu forcefully increasing his strength brought about extremely serious consequences. The slightest carelessness could affect his foundation.

Therefore, these past few days, the Pavilion Master had spent almost all her time taking care of Qin Yu to minimize the impact.

At this moment, Jingdu was in an uproar.

Almost everyone was discussing the battle between Qin Yu and Han Wei.

As the young master of the Han family, Han Wei was naturally very famous. His failure made him a laughingstock this time.

“In the future, if I want to defeat Qin Yu, I’m afraid I can only rely on my realm.” Zhuang Teng and the others sighed to themselves.

As descendants of aristocratic families, they didn’t think that they were stronger than Han Wei. Of course, there were some exceptions.

For example, Yan Sihai’s son, Yan Jinyao.

He was publicly acknowledged as the number one genius, but he had never made a move. No one knew his true strength.

Jingdu’s power dynamic was complicated. No one knew how many low-key descendants of aristocratic families were hidden in the shadows.

Jingdu, Han family.

Han Meng stayed by Han Wei’s side taking care of him every day.

He had specially hired a professional nursing team from overseas to take care of Han Wei.

As he looked at Han Wei lying on the bed with a serious injury, Han Meng’s expression was extremely gloomy.

“Qin Yu... you have completely angered me!” Han Meng said coldly.

If the Han family were to go all out, no one knew how much power they could mobilize.

But everyone was waiting for the Han family’s action.

Yan family.

Yan Sihai sat in the study and his expression was extremely cold.

At this time, Yan Sihai’s military advisor walked in from outside the door.

“Have you investigated thoroughly?” Yan Sihai glanced at the military advisor and said.

The military advisor bowed and said, “Yhe Jingdu Martial Arts Association seems to be extremely secretive about Miss Yan’s matter. If you want to investigate thoroughly, I’m afraid you’ll have to personally take action.”

Yan Sihai frowned slightly.

The Jingdu Martial Arts Association suddenly took Yan Ruoxue away, so he was puzzled.

One had to know that before this, Yan Ruoxue and the Jingdu Martial Arts Association didn’t have a deep relationship.

“How strange.” Yan Sihai touched his chin.

“President Yan, I think that what we should focus on right now is Qin Yu,” the military counselor reminded.

“Now, the outside world is saying that if Qin Yu doesn’t die, he will definitely surpass all the major aristocratic families in the future, just like Ye Qing did back then. He might even surpass Ye Qing,” the military counselor said in a deep voice.

Yan Sihai snorted lightly and said, “Ye Qing reached his current status only because of the environment. Otherwise, he would only be a martial artist.”

The military counselor didn’t comment on this, but he was still a little worried.

“President Yan, have you ever thought that Qin Yu might be invincible in the Martial Marquis Realm? What if he stepped into the legendary Martial Saint Realm?” The military counselor asked in a deep voice.

Yan Sihai glanced at the military counselor and said with a light snort, “Impossible. How many years has it been since a Martial Saint appeared?”

The military advisor sighed. “It’s indeed difficult, but it isn’t impossible.”

“If he really stepped into the Martial Saint stage, we must reconsider this.”

Yan Sihai didn’t deny this.

If a Martial Saint really appeared,?he wouldn’t be someone that the various aristocratic families could deal with.

At that time, it was likely that the entire country’s upper echelons would give Qin Yu the green light.

“Don’t worry, the ones who suffered the most damage this time isn’t us, but the Han family.” Yan Sihai said as he lit up a cigar.

“Han Meng will be making a big move very soon, so just wait and see.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The military advisor nodded his head slightly and said. “We can inform the Saint Confucian Sect and have Gu Canghai find an opportunity to hunt down Qin Yu.”

Yan Sihai thought for a moment and said, “Go make the arrangements.”

“Yes, Mr. Yan.”

...

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

Qin Yu was still in a coma and didn’t show any signs of waking up.

But these few days, the entire Martial Arts Forum was extremely lively!

Although the Han family and the Yan family had tried their best to suppress the news, in the end, it couldn’t be kept under wraps.

Not only did they fail to suppress the news, but there were even many videos circulating.

Upon seeing Han Wei being beaten up, the people on the Martial Arts Forum couldn’t help but be shocked.

“So Han Wei just seems intimidating, but he’s actually useless.”

“Bullsh * t. I once fought with Han Wei. His strength is out of this world. He is definitely one of the best even in Jingdu.”

“That’s right. Countless geniuses in Jingdu have been defeated by Han Wei. The fact that he lost this time can only mean that Qin Yu is stronger.”

“How many years has it been since someone like Qin Yu appeared? An ordinary person who came from Jiangcheng has beaten up Han Wei now. It’s simply unimaginable.”

“From today onwards, Qin Yu is my idol!”

For a time, many young martial artists on the Martial Arts Forum regarded Qin Yu as a god!

Especially those martial artists with no powerful background!

Han Meng looked at the news on the Martial Arts Forum and his expression couldn’t help but turn extremely gloomy.

“Qin Yu... you have humiliated the Han family!” Han Meng said through gritted teeth.

“President Han, the master is here.” At this moment, someone suddenly ran over.

When he heard this, Han Meng’s expression couldn’t help but change.

He was just about to get up when he saw an old man in his eighties walk in from outside the door.

This old man was none other than the true patriarch of the Han family, Han Chongming!

There were several people following him, and one of them was Han Meng’s biological brother, Han Xiu!

“Dad, why are you here?” Han Meng hurriedly stood up and whispered.

Han Chongming glanced at Han Xiu coldly and raised his hand to slap him.

This slap made Han Meng’s ears ring.

He covered his face but didn’t dare to say anything.

“A big good-for-nothing gives birth to a little good-for-nothing,” Han Chongming said coldly.

He glanced at Han Wei, who was lying on the bed in a coma, and said coldly, “Two pieces of trash. You two have completely disgraced the Han family!”

“Dad, I... I’ll handle this matter properly as soon as possible,” Han Meng hurriedly said.

Han Xiu sneered and said, “You don’t need to handle this matter. Leave it to me.”

Han Meng immediately became anxious when he heard that.

Old Master Han had always liked Han Xiu more and had always looked down on Han Meng.

If this matter was left to Han Xiu to deal with, then Han Meng’s position in the Han family would plummet in the future!

Not only that, but even his own son would be affected!

“Dad, trust me. I’ll deal with this matter as soon as possible!” Han Meng said anxiously.

Han Chongming looked at Han Meng coldly and said, “Do you know what your greatest value is?”

Han Meng, not knowing what to say for a moment, opened his mouth.

Han Chongming snorted coldly and said, “The greatest value you and your son have is to establish a marital alliance with the Yan family through the eldest daughter of the Yan family!”

“In the end? The wedding was a mess, and you guys even embarrassed the Han family!”

Han Meng’s expression was extremely ugly. He gritted his teeth and said in a low voice, “Dad, give me a few days. I... I will definitely take care of these two matters!”

“I guarantee that the Yan family won’t break off the engagement, and Qin Yu... will definitely die!”
