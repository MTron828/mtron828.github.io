2031 Si Liuhe Arrives

The head of the Chu family was furious, but he didn’t dare to flare up.

He hurriedly ran to Chu Sheng’s side and helped him up with a face full of guilt.

To befriend the nine great aristocratic families, they had suffered all kinds of grievances and humiliation. Unfortunately, all their efforts were in vain.

At this moment, an affiliated aristocratic family of the Si family passed by. An elderly man leading the way said sarcastically, “Even if you want to be a dog, you have to see if you have the qualifications.”

Hearing this, the expression of the head of the Chu family turned even uglier.

Qin Yu clearly saw this scene.

He couldn’t help but sneer in his heart as it further reaffirmed Qin Yu’s thoughts.

The Chu family was definitely not powerful. Otherwise, the Si family would not have been so disrespectful.

“The Yin Yang Sword in their hands is a supreme treasure. I can’t miss it if I have a chance,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

In the following few days, the strange phenomenon of the Chaos Grave was non-stop. From time to time, mysterious chaotic qi would spew out of the cracks.

However, there were still no signs of the Chaos Grave opening.

Many cultivators who had stopped nearby were getting closer and closer to the center of the Chaos Grave. Qin Yu was no exception.

He stood under a tree with his eyes closed and listened to the Formation Masters in the center of the Chaos Grave quietly.

“How long will it take for the Chaos Grave to open?” a white-robed elder asked.

“Normally, it will take three days at most, but… According to our speculations, the Tai Chi Formation was set up here. There should be something suppressing it in the two formation cores of the formation. Unfortunately, there’s nothing in these formation cores. It seems to have been taken away by someone,” a Formation Master replied.

When Qi Yu heard this, his expression changed slightly.

Formation core? Was it the two locations of the Yin Yang Fish?

There were indeed two corpses on it, but Qin Yu had secretly taken them away!

“Can you deduce the heavenly secrets to see who had taken it?” the elder continued to ask.

Qin Yu was shocked to hear this, and his expression became somewhat unnatural.

“We’ve tried, but the dao techniques here are all chaotic. We can’t deduce it at all,” the Formation Master replied.

Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief when he heard that.

Fortunately, they did not discover him. Otherwise, he would be in big trouble.

“Let’s not care about that anymore and open the Chaos Grave as soon as possible. It won’t be long before the other aristocratic families arrive,” the elder waved his hand and said.

At this point, he paused for a while before he continued, “The Chaos Grave is of great importance this time. The head of the family will be coming personally. Anything untoward must not happen.”

“Yes, sir!”

When the surrounding people heard the conversation between the two, they all sighed.

“I didn’t expect even the head of the Si family to show up.”

“Nonsense! The Holy Son of the Si family has a chaotic body. If he can get this body, Si Shiyue will become the number one person among the young generation in the Holy Region! It can even be said that he has stepped into the Immortal Emperor realm!”

“Immortal Emperor realm? Would other aristocratic families agree? Once Si Shiyue becomes the first Immortal Emperor, there won’t be any more nine great aristocratic families in the Holy Region!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Of course, they won’t agree. So some people think they will discuss it, and some think they will fall out because of this. Of course, all these are just speculations. After all, no one knows what’s in the Chaos Grave.”

“Tsk! Tsk! If the nine great aristocratic families start a war because of this, that would be interesting.”

Qin Yu clearly heard everyone’s discussion.

He rubbed his chin and thought to himself, “It seems that the opening of the Chaos Grave this time is most probably a good opportunity.”

A large-scale war probably would not occur, but disputes would arise most probably.

“The head of the Si family has come here personally. I wonder what treasures will be unearthed during the opening of the Chaos Grave,” someone said.

Time passed by, and in the blink of an eye, another two days had passed.

In these two days, more and more people gathered near the Chaos Grave. Qin Yu stood up and looked around unwittingly, trying to find the figure of the man with the mustache.

With the help of the man with the mustache, the chances of success would naturally be much higher.

Unfortunately, the man with the mustache’s ability to conceal the internal qi was far beyond Qin Yu’s, so he could not detect it at all.

The closer they got to the opening of the Chaos Grave, the more intense the pressure became.

There was a hint of uneasiness and palpitation in the crowd. Some people left, but more people arrived.

“Rumble…”

The earth rumbled, and the world trembled. From time to time, one could feel a powerful internal qi erupting.

This internal qi mixed chaotically, causing Qin Yu to feel an indescribable sense of familiarity.

At this moment, powerful internal qi swept across the sky. A dozen of people were seen arriving riding the wind.

Wearing long robes and looking like immortals, each had incredibly powerful strength.

And Qin Yu recognized the person leading at a glance!

He was none other than Yan Guyun of the Yan family!

“Yan Guyun is leading the Yan family,” someone said secretly.

“Yan Guyun… What an ancient name. He hasn’t appeared in a long time.”

“Yeah, I heard that Yan Guyun is the best friend of the head of the Yan family. He’s also his right-hand man.”

At this moment, Qin Yu saw another familiar face. “The former Holy Son of the Yan family, Yan Yunfan!

“Tsk! Tsk! The one who came to the Chaos Grave this time is not the saintess, Yan Ruoxue?” someone whispered.

...

“As the person with the most complete bloodline in the Yan family, Yan Ruoxue naturally wouldn’t appear at such an occasion. If anything untoward happens, it would be a great loss to the Yan family.”

“Yeah, Immortal Emperor Tianming’s bloodline is incomparably powerful. Even a chaotic body might not be comparable to it.”

“Immortal Emperor Tianming is one of the most powerful Immortal Emperors in history. Any dao technique he leaves behind can contend with the entire Holy Region.”

Qin Yu remained silent. He looked in Yan Guyun’s direction, feeling a little uneasy.

Yan Guyun was too powerful. His strength was beyond Qin Yu’s imagination. He had injured Jue Wu with a single lift of his hand. Although he had not stepped into the True Saint cultivation realm, he would probably do so soon.

Following the Yan family’s arrival, the members of the Si family also appeared one after another.

Although the elders of the Si family had already come to guard the Chaos Grave, the real protagonist of the Si family had not appeared.

“Look, the Si family is here!” someone exclaimed.

Everyone looked over in an instant! There was no other reason than that everyone knew that the Si family was the true protagonist of this Chaos Grave!

The one leading doesn’t seem to be the head of the Si family,” someone whispered.

“That person is… It’s Si family Grandmaster, Si Liuhe!” Someone recognized the leader.

...

“What? It’s Si Liuhe?”

Upon hearing this name, the crowd instantly erupted into a heated discussion!
