Chapter 2794: Compete for the Investiture of Gods

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

This person was the old Daoist who had lived on the top of the Nine Nether Cliff for a long time and made many people afraid.

With his appearance, it seemed that the entire void had undergone some kind of change.

A golden staircase was formed when his feet landed on the ground to lift him.

Even the wind gave way, afraid its resistance would affect him.

What a terrifying peak power! The sky seemed to be filled with this old Daoist’s peak power.

Lance, who was beside Fatty Situ, also turned pale.

“Who is this guy?

The appearance of this person shocked him even more than Ming Alester.

Ming Alester was famous. However, the number one kulapati lived in seclusion at the top of the Nine Nether Cliff in the Saint Kingdom for almost all years.

He almost didn’t appear in the Saint World although his name was known in the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom.

Therefore, almost no one noticed the number one kulapati, Bai Zizai.

After all, those who were famous were all well-known in the entire Saint World. Very few stubborn people could be recognized.

Boom!

A red and white strange aura suddenly spiraled up. These two forces are entangled.

A mournful howl seemed to be transmitted from beyond the Nine Nether Cliff. Almost at the same time, Smoker Xie, Qin Ji, and all the other Creepy suddenly cracked.

Their bodies turned into billions of blood-red sticky threads which squirmed like maggots.

Corpse threads?

Zi Yan looked at the disintegrating Smoker Xie and revealed a hint of enlightenment.

It was these threads that gave these Creepy an almost indestructible power.

The threads flooded the ghost bride and the other Creepy’s body like a torrent. The violent power broke the two heads free from Bai Zizai’s palm.

The Creepy red and white internal qi spiraled up and erupted like a volcano.

In an instant, sorrowful music resounded throughout the entire void.

Red and white figures were everywhere. An extremely ominous power spread out from the center of the ghost bride.

The extreme ominous feeling surged out like a tidal wave.

The cultivators affected by this power seemed to have fallen into a nightmare.

Their faces turned pale and their bodies trembled.

Then, they fell straight down and could not wake up again.

“Be careful!”

Fatty Situ’s face turned solemn.

The Heavenly Umbrella blocked this power, but the handle let out a sound of being unable to bear the weight as if it would break at any moment.

“Such a terrifying strength! I think this can be considered the pinnacle of peak power.”

Lance muttered behind.

He did not expect the immortal creatures controlled by the Investiture of Gods would have such a move.

Bai Zizai stood still like a reef in the deep sea in the middle of the red-white Creepy peak power. No matter how the seawater hit him, he did not move.

When the red and white airflow approached him, it split into two.

The two powerful peak powers collided.

Bai Zizai walked forward step by step.

He strolled to the front of the red-white Creepy and then transmigrated.

In the next moment, the tide-like red-white peak power suddenly disappeared.

The gloomy shadows that filled the sky instantly disappeared.

The two heads flew up and down in his hands. His expression was as usual as if he had just done something insignificant.

Then, his body arched like a shrimp. In the next moment, he had already appeared beside Ming Alester. “Long time no see.”

Ming’s face revealed a sinister look.

“Yeah, it’s been a long time.”

Bai Zizai also revealed a rare look of nostalgia.

“Boss Qin Yu, you control this umbrella. I’ve already erased my soul imprint just now. I’m afraid Lance won’t care about you all if I give this to him.”

While Qin Yu was still in a daze, Fatty Situ had already rushed towards the Investiture of Gods with the power of the divine picture of the Luo River.

“You da*n fatty! You must come back alive!”

Qin Yu felt a little like to cry.

No matter what reason Fatty Situ had, Qin Yu felt an indescribable emotion at this moment as he handed over such a precious treasure to him.

“The young lord’s personality is the same as the old master’s. Many years ago, the old master made the right bet. I wonder if the young lord can come back alive this time.”

Lace’s face was filled with bitterness.

“Ah Shan, Ah Yu, follow the young lord. Even if we can’t help, we must witness this moment!”

Lance growled in a low voice. “Wait, I’ll go with you!” Qin Yu did not hesitate.

“I’ll go too!”

Aiden and Chang Mang said at the same time.

The power of the Investiture of Gods had far exceeded everyone’s imagination. If the three of them did not have the Heavenly Umbrella, they would have died at any time. Qin Yu could not let such a thing happen.

“It seems like there’s a reason why the Situ family can be the wealthiest. They have collected so many powerful magical artifacts and never decline.” Aiden nodded.

Whether it was Fatty Situ or his three followers, it was enough to determine how terrifying this family was.

Even if he didn’t have the talent of the Alester family, they still felt it was a huge power that could shake the Saint World.

Qin Yu protected everyone with the Heavenly Umbrella.

However, they could not get any closer after they had moved for a distance. Violent air currents washed over the Heavenly Umbrella.

The collision between the two caused the surrounding space to distort. The distance that seemed to be close at hand was now countless lightyears away.

The long-browed old servant also tried his best to get close to the final land of the Investiture of Gods but he also failed.

In front of this powerful force, not even a trace of air could enter.

Boom!

Amidst the sound of countless space ruptures. Fatty Situ, entered like a meteorite although he was wrapped in the divine picture of the Luo River.

In the next moment, a petite figure appeared.

Zi Yan untied her straps and placed the huge Ten Directions Annihilation on her back to the side.

“The little fatty from the Situ family is here too. Aren’t you afraid of dying here? How dare you enter the Investiture of Gods with just the power of a

talisman! ”

Bai Zizai said with a smile.

“Uncle Bai, I’m only here to help you two.”

Fatty Situ wiped the cold sweat from his temples and quickly flattered the two of them.

Zi Yan stood silently. The space around Ten Directions Annihilation was constantly being destroyed.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Even if this divine artifact unintentionally emitted power, it was still terrifying because it could destroy space.

With the addition of the Investiture of Gods, the power emitted by the five forces collided. It instantly produced a compressed change..
