2190 Stepping into the True Saint Realm

His figure slowly faded away as his eyes stared at Qin Yu quietly.

This time, his gaze was no longer fierce and formidable, and the battle intent had disappeared. Instead, it was filled with indescribable complexity, like looking at his own offspring.

Qin Yu bowed deeply to Wu Ji’s figure.

Deep in Qin Yu’s heart, he understood that after this farewell, he might not be able to see this world again.

Without Wu Ji’s guidance, Qin Yu definitely could not comprehend the dao technique in such a short period of time.

Wu Ji had not only passed down the dao technique to Qin Yu but had also become Qin Yu’s teacher.

He was quietly grateful to Wu Ji, his heart filled with respect and gratitude. Wu Ji’s inheritance was not merely the dao technique but also spiritual guidance and enlightenment.

Finally, Wu Ji’s figure completely disappeared. He turned into specks of light and entered Qin Yu’s glabella.

Qin Yu understood that what entered his mind was the Traceless Immortal Scripture that he had obtained.

The surrounding world began to disappear, and the sky that had transformed slowly disappeared from Qin Yu’s vision.

“The heavenly tribulation… is over,” Qin Yu murmured.

He spread his hands and closed his eyes, quietly waiting for the sky to completely darken.

Soon, the surrounding scenery turned into nothingness again. It was the void where Qin Yu was.

It was still pitch black here. Besides that tremendously dense internal qi, he could not sense anything else.

Qin Yu slowly opened his hands and slightly closed his eyes, feeling the internal qi slowly changing in his body.

The True Saint Realm had started to descend!

Boundless internal qi surged wildly in Qin Yu’s body. The True Saint Realm was a significant turning point. Once one stepped into the True Saint Realm, it meant entering a completely different level. It was a transformative process that changed one from the inside out, like a rebirth.

Qin Yu stood quietly in the darkness of the void. She opened her hands slightly and felt the endless internal qi surging in his body. His body started to change gradually, and his internal qi became more condensed and formidable.

Suddenly, a dazzling light rose from the center of Qin Yu’s body and gradually spread out. The light contained an incomparable solemn and sacred internal qi, illuminating the void.

As the light spread, Qin Yu’s body rose gradually and appeared in the darkness. His body gradually grew increasingly taller, and his aura was incomparably fierce and formidable. The dark void around him began to collapse and was replaced by a dazzling light.

Qin Yu’s muscles bulged, and his body became robust and powerful. His eyes also changed. His black pupils turned into sacred eyes that flickered with golden light. Around his body, countless mysterious runes floated like ancient words of wisdom.

The entire scene seemed to be enveloped by a layer of sacred light that filled every corner. As the light spread, everything in the surroundings began to change. A scene gradually appeared in the empty darkness, forming a grand scene of heaven and earth.

In the space where Qin Yu was, there were mountains, rivers, forests, lakes, flowers, plants, and trees. Everything was lifelike. He could feel the vitality and power in this world as if he could hear the pulse of the earth.

The runes in the sky became even more dazzling. They interweaved into complicated and mysterious patterns as if they were telling endless wisdom and dao technique. These runes seemed to be the profound mysteries of heaven and earth formed after Qin Yu fused with Wu Ji’s dao technique. It allowed him to grasp the power of heaven and earth.

As Qin Yu’s power continued growing, he could feel the link between his body and the heavens and earth. He could absorb the energy between heaven and earth and sense the rules and truths of the universe.

“Boom!”

Boundless Holy Power spread at this moment. Qin Yu’s body contained boundless power!

With a raise of his hand, he could easily capture the dao technique. With a casual palm strike, he could shatter all the rules and the way!

Qin Yu’s figure appeared incomparably dignified and solemn in this sacred realm. His body seemed to carry the power of the entire universe. He could easily grasp the profundities of the dao technique and control the rules of the heavens and earth at his will.

A boundless Holy Power surged in his body, bringing limitless power. When he raised his hand, an invisible force surged, capable of shattering all rules and the way. Every punch and palm of his emitted the power of destruction and creation! FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

It was a tremendously strange feeling as if he had entered another state.

“Is this True Saint…” Qin Yu murmured.

However, he knew very well that it was not merely because he had stepped into the True Saint Realm but also the dao technique he had created and the dao technique that had been fused with Wu Ji’s.

Looking at the void before him, Qin Yu slowly raised his palm.

In an instant, boundless light continuously condensed in his palm!

The light turned into a speck of light the size of a grain of rice in the end.

Immediately after, Qin Yu clenched his fist lightly, and the light spot instantly exploded!

Terrifying airwaves swept out in all directions at this moment. The quiet void was completely torn apart by this power, forming cracks!

The calm and ethereal void became tremendously violent at this moment!

The dense and peaceful chaotic qi churned violently at this moment as if being impacted by something!

Qin Yu stood in the middle of the storm. His expression was calm, neither joyful nor sad. He just watched quietly.

At this moment, the void before him was torn apart. A trace of light penetrated the void and shone on Qin Yu’s face!

It was the radiance of the stars in the vast universe, which meant the void had been completely torn apart!

The little bit of light slowly enlarged, and the sound of tearing echoed in the void like the sorrowful cry of heavens and earth. More cracks appeared, forming a wide crack that revealed an even more brilliant and dazzling light.

As the crack expanded, the void where Qin Yu was completely collapsed and revealed the scene of another world. It was a bright and boundless cosmic space.

Countless stars were shining within, as dazzling as gemstones. Nebulas filled the sky, and the laws of the universe revolved in this new world.

The massive planets, galaxies, and nebulas formed this magnificent universe painting scroll. Boundlessless universe energy flowed within it. The power of the universe pervaded every corner like an invisible bond connecting everything!

Qin Yu looked at this light spot and then stepped forward, completely escaping the sealed void!

“I’ve finally escaped.” Qin Yu’s mood was somewhat complicated. He was not as excited as he had imagined when escaping from the void. Instead, he appeared extremely calm.

Perhaps it was due to the change in his state of mind. There was no joy on his face but only a trace of emotion from the vicissitudes of time.
