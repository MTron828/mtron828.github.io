Chapter 1449: Chapter 1,449, meeting Yongji 1

Qin Yu didn’t have a good impression of Mr. Yongji. After hearing Jue Wu’s words, Qin Yu was even more certain of her own thoughts.

“I’ll leave it to you. Just say that I’m not here,”Jue Wu muttered.

Then, she immediately restrained her aura and hid.

Qin Yu had no choice but to meet Mr. Yongji.

A few minutes later.

Mr. Yong Ji walked up from the foot of the mountain. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

He was different from Qin Yu’s impression of him. She had thought that he would be as tall and majestic as Xiao Hai. Unexpectedly, Mr. Yong Ji looked extremely thin and small, and his face was somewhat dry.

He was not an ordinary thin and weak person. Instead, it was as if his body had been hollowed out.

“Greetings, Mister Yongji,”Qin Yu bowed and said.

Mister Yongji sized up Qin Yu and said, “You are?”

“I’m Qin Yu. Lord Jue Wu is not here. I’ll be receiving you,”Qin Yu said.

Upon hearing this, Yongji said in surprise, “You’re that Qin Yu? Wen Wanji’s disciple?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Yes, Mister Yongji, please come in.”

Under the lead of the two attendants, Qin Yu and Mr. Yong Ji came to a tea room.

Birds chirped and flowers were fragrant. The bamboo swayed in the wind. There was a small stream, bringing with it the sound of rustling.

Qin Yu and Mr. Yong Ji sat down. The two attendants immediately poured tea for the two of them.

“Mr. Yong Ji, Lord Jue Wu is not here. Why Don’t you wait for him?”Qin Yu casually found a topic to talk about.

Yong Ji waved his hand and said, “It’s okay. I came first to congratulate her, and second to meet you.”

“Meet Me?”Qin Yu was quite surprised.

Yong ji laughed and said, “There’s a genius like you in the South Province. Of course, I want to meet him.”

Qin Yu glanced at Yong Ji. He suddenly felt that Yong Ji in front of him was not simple.

“Mr. Yong Ji, why are you looking for me? Just tell me,”Qin Yu said.

Yong Ji took a sip of tea and sighed, “It’s been a long time since a talent like you appeared in the South Province. It seems that the younger generation of the South Province can’t carry the banner anymore.”

These words could not help but Shock Qin Yu!

The young generation of the South Province was full of talents. How could they not carry the banner?

Thus, Qin Yu asked suspiciously, “Mr. Yong Ji, your words seem to be biased. Even though I don’t know much about the southern province, I know quite a few geniuses.”

“Oh? Tell me about it,”Yong Ji said with a faint smile.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Not to mention far away, just Ling Yun from the Heavenly Cloud sect is an extraordinary genius.”

“Ling Yun?”However, Yong Ji scoffed at the mention of Ling Yun.

“That talent is nothing at all.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown when she heard this.

Ling Yun was nothing at all? He was known as the number one genius in South Province.

“Hiding in the city. Compared to You, Ling Yun is nothing,”Yong Ji said with a faint smile.

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly. He suddenly guessed something.

“Perhaps... Ling Yun is nothing compared to your foster son. However, he is indeed a top-notch genius in the entire South Province,”Qin Yu probed.

Yong Ji said with a faint smile, “I heard that the Tianyun sect has taken in a new disciple. His name is Di Zun.”

Qin Yu didn’t listen to him at all!

He only knew that Yong Ji didn’t deny his own words!

In other words, his guess was right. Every foster son under him was probably above Ling Yun!

What kind of power was this? No wonder someone said that Mr. Yong Ji’s Yong Ji City was no weaker than the Tianyun sect!

Mr. Yong Ji continued, “You should have heard that the major parts of Lizhou are getting closer and closer. One day, they will completely merge into one.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, I heard senior Xiao Hai say that.”

When Xiao Hai was mentioned, an unnatural look flashed across Yong Ji’s face, but it only lasted for a moment.

Yong Ji continued, “The younger generation of the Southern Prefecture is probably the weakest group in the vast region of Li Prefecture. Qin Yu, you should accept the best resources.”

Qin Yu did not respond to him. Instead, she continued, “Mr. Yong Ji, are you familiar with senior Xiao Hai? Both of you are legends of the Southern Prefecture. You should be very familiar with each other, right?”

An unnatural expression flashed across Yongji’s face once again. He smiled and said, “I’m not very familiar with each other, but I do know each other.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Oh, Mister Yongji, please continue.”

Yongji thought for a moment, then shook his head and said, “I don’t have much to say. If there’s a chance, go to my Yongji City and have a seat.”

Qin Yu agreed, “Alright. If there’s a chance, I’ll definitely go.”

Yong Ji stood up, seemingly intending to leave.

After taking two steps, he stopped and said, “Qin Yu, you and the Tianyun sect have an irreconcilable feud, right?”

“En... it’s not irreconcilable, but there is indeed a feud,”Qin Yu said with a smile.

All of this hatred originated from elder Bai and Grand Elder.

When Yong Ji heard this, he couldn’t help but sigh, “That shouldn’t be. I thought you were someone who valued friendship.”

After saying this, Yong Ji turned around and was about to leave.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and hurriedly chased after him.

“Mr. Yong Ji, what do you mean by this sentence?”Qin Yu frowned and asked.
