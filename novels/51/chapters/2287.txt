2288 The Entrustment of the Yun Family Head

This Vajra Fist also reached the strength of a ninth-grade realm. It even faintly suppressed the Fire Fist unleashed under the cosmic form with all its might.

“Borrowing the power of a magical artifact is ultimately an external strength! Only one’s own strength is one’s barrier.”

Hua Tian shook his head and increased the strength of his fist.

The Fire Fist immediately retreated step by step, and its arm was suppressed to the point that it almost contracted.

“Fighting word formula! You want to see my own strength, do you?”

A cold smile appeared on Qin Yu’s face, and the terrifying internal qi around him suddenly increased.

Under the fighting word formula, his chaotic qi instantly increased by more than three times, and he threw back the Fire Fist.

With the support of the fighting word formula, the power of this punch instantly soared.

The terrifying power directly shattered the Fist of Vajra, creating a space of tens of thousands of feet on the ground.

“D*mn it! He ran away!”

Qin Yu carefully sensed the internal qi around him and realized Hua Tian and Nangong Qi’s internal qi had disappeared. He was instantly infuriated.

He had been hiding the fighting word formula, thinking of suddenly attacking at the last moment.

“Thank you, Mr. Qin Yu, for saving our lives. I, Yun Lin, bow to you on behalf of all the deceased members of the Yun family!”

Yun Lin walked up to Qin Yu and bowed deeply.

“Mr. Qin Yu, thank you.”

Yun Qingyun also came forward and said softly.

“This Hua Tian is so cruel. No one cares about it?”

Qin Yu asked with a frown. No matter where they were, there should be order.

In a chaotic world, the cultivators with low cultivation would be the most miserable if there was no order.

“When the purgatory’s Mystic Realm opened, too many human cultivators died. Also, the Path of Heaven seems to have changed. Many rogue cultivators cultivating in purgatory have come out of seclusion. There are cruel people among them. No one can control them.”

Yun Lin said with a bitter smile.

“We went to ask the people from the Evil Extermination Sect to take action, but they said that this was a conflict between two parties and we have to resolve ourselves.”

A middle-aged man beside Yun Lin said.

“Unfortunately, the bald donkey escaped!”

Yun Lin gritted his teeth and said, his teeth sinking deep into his lip, his body trembling violently.

His wife and many brothers and sisters had all died tragically in the Yun family’s calamity. This was enough to make a person break down.

“My condolences, Sir. I will definitely take his life to pay back if I meet him!”

Qin Yu patted Yun Lin’s shoulder. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

…

At this moment, two figures suddenly appeared on a continent near the Heavenly Origin Continent.

They were Hua Tian and Nangong Qi. Hua Tian patted his stomach, and a trace of fear flashed across his face.

“If I hadn’t cultivated the Primordial Heavenly Divination and prevented the crisis in advance, I would have been seriously injured by this punch!”

“This person is a genius from the Holy Region and is also being hunted by people from the Holy Region. He has many enemies now. Can we take advantage of this?”

Nangong Qi sneered and said.

“It’s fine. I cultivate the Primordial Heavenly Divination and am now in an invincible position in battle. I’m just waiting for an opportunity to kill this kid and devour his luck. At that time, I can become the number one person in the current Path of Heaven.”

Hua Tian laughed loudly.

“Congratulations to Lord Hua Tian in advance.”

Nangong Qi said humbly.

“Next, we just have to wait. I’ve already captured a wisp of his internal qi and deduced that this child will definitely encounter a calamity in the near future. It will be time for me to make a move at that time! But before that, I want you to do something for me to show your loyalty.”

Hua Tian said with a smile, but his gaze made Nangong Qi tremble.

He knew this crazy demon who killed without batting an eyelid would reveal this expression whenever he had some sinister scheme.

“What is it, Lord Hua Tian? I’ll definitely go through fire and water without hesitation as long as I can do it.”

“I feel that your temperament is similar to the sect master of the Mysterious Dark Sect. That old fart Shui Yuan has lived for too long.”

Hua Tian grinned sinisterly.

…

“Sir, what do you plan to do next?”

Qin Yu and a dozen people from the Yun family were clearing the bodies of the Yun family’s cultivators.

“Mr. Qin Yu, I only ask you for one thing. You must kill this person and avenge the tragic death of my Yun family’s cultivators if you have the chance in this life.”

Yun Lin seemed to have aged dozens of years after clearing the remains.

“I’ll definitely do my best. However, this monk seems to have cultivated a divination technique that allows him to sense danger in advance.”

Qin Yu shook his head. He had already concealed that attack very well just now.

At the last moment, he used the fighting word formula, but Hua Tian still managed to escape.

He must have already set the spatial coordinates in other places in advance before he could teleport away.

This kind of veteran cultivator who was as meticulous as a dog would escape even if he smelled a hint of bad things. Qin Yu really did not have the confidence to kill him.

“Of course. These are my Yun family’s supreme treasures, three Green Spirit Trees. Take it as your reward.”

Yun Lin took out three Green Spirit Trees from his spatial ring and placed them on Qin Yu’s hand.

“You can’t do that, Sir. It’s the foundation for our Yun family to make a comeback! How can you hand it over to an outsider?”

An elderly man cried out loud and tried to stop him.

“That’s right, Yun Lin. Although Mr. Qin saved our lives, we can consider other things like spiritual essence. You have no right to give away this family’s holy item. I don’t think Mr. Qin is a person who would do anything for profit!”

The other elderly man glanced at Qin Yu and complimented him.

“You shut up! The business with the Mysterious Dark Sect was also pushed forward by you! All your thoughts were on these external matters. Our family has been destroyed. Do you still need these things to feed the dogs? If there were a few of you whose cultivation was similar to mine, the Yun family would not be in this state!”

Yun Lin pointed at the elderly man and cursed.

Several of them instantly trembled and did not dare to reply.

“Senior, I don’t need this thing. Your Yun family needs it more.”

Qin Yu shook his head. He did not come for benefits this time.

He had always remembered Uncle Qun and Yun Qingyun’s kindness in sending him on his journey, and he also wanted to kill Nangong Qi.

“It doesn’t matter. I know what you’re thinking. This Yun family was fought for by my ancestors for three generations. I want you to take Yun Qingyun and leave!”

Yun Lin pointed at Yun Qingyun.

“No, Father, I don’t want to leave you.”

Yun Qingyun hugged Yun Lin and cried.

Yun Lin gently hugged Yun Qingyun, and a wisp of spiritual energy blocked her divine sense, making her fall asleep.

“Although I don’t know if I can sense the Path of Heaven, the recent outbreak of Ghost Mansion Mystic Realm has killed more than half of the cultivators in this galaxy. After that, almost all the top-notch martial artists appeared one by one. Subsequently, it will be a chaotic era. I want you to protect the tinder of my Yun family.”

“She’s my friend.”

Qin Yu said softly and put Yun Qingyun into the space of the Sumeru ring.

“Yun Lin, what do you mean by the fight of your three generations? What about our sacrifices? You may take away one Green Spirit Tree at most. You can be silly yourself, but we won’t be!”

An old man shouted. He was Yun Lin’s eldest brother and also the one who had helped the Yun family and the Mysterious Dark Sect to do business.
