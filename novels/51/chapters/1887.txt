1888 The Horror of the Inheritance

Qin Yu was instantly shocked. Could it be that he did not need to comprehend these cultivation techniques? And he could use them directly?

Was this something his father had left behind on purpose or was it because of his bloodline?

If it was because of the bloodline, wouldn’t the descendants of the respective aristocratic families be able to comprehend the techniques left behind by their ancestors directly?

Qin Yu remained silent. He tried to capture another ray of golden light.

This time, the golden light also entered Qin Yu’s primordial spirit and turned into a memory.

The difference was that this time, it wasn’t a cultivation technique but a location that seemed to contain treasures.

“There are even treasures…” Qin Yu gasped in disbelief.

As the Guardian, could his father not sense the hiding places of the treasures in the world?

Could it be that he had stored all his memories in Qin Yu’s body?

In that case, wouldn’t Qin Yu be able to find out the hiding places of any treasures in the world and take them out?

Qin Yu did not say a word. He just sat there with his legs crossed as if he was in deep thought.

His father’s actions were definitely against the rules. If others found out, he would probably be punished even more severely.

To save Qin Yu, his father had violated the Path of Heaven once. Now he had left such an important hidden treasure in Qin Yu’s mind. Who knew what would happen in the future? Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Phew.”

After some time, Qin Yu got up and heaved a sigh of relief.

It was his father’s decision. It was not up to Qin Yu to comment. All this could be said to be painstaking. What Qin Yu could do was not waste his father’s painstaking efforts.

The sky was gradually turning bright, and it was time to leave Thunder Academy.

That day, the door opened, and the two messengers had been waiting for them.

Qin Yu and Chang Mang walked out of Thunder Academy together. They then returned to the first main peak led by the two messengers.

The moment they left the teleportation formation, Chang Mang could not help but say excitedly, “This Thunder Academy is really a hidden treasure. Why didn’t I discover this place earlier?”

Qin Yu glanced at Chang Mang and said with a smile, “Then you can stay here. As long as you have enough points, you can enter Thunder Academy at any time.”

Chang Mang hurriedly shook his head and said, “No! No! No! I’ll go wherever you go. I’ll follow you.”

Qin Yu knew he couldn’t persuade Chang Mang. Now that he was in control of so many resources of the Holy Region, bringing Chang Mang along was not a bad choice.

“You go back to Demon-slaying Peak first and wait for me. I’m going to see Dean Lei,” Qin Yu said to Chang Mang.

“Alright,” Chang Mang responded and left the first main peak.

Qin Yu went all the way to Dean Lei’s residence. He stood at the door and said softly, “I’m here paying respects to the dean.”

A minute later, Dean Lei’s voice was heard from inside.

“Come in,” Dean Lei said.

Qin Yu quickly walked into the room and came to see Dean Lei.

Dean Lei reached out his hand, and a round cushion appeared in front of Qin Yu.

Qin Yu sat across from Dean Lei. As soon as he sat down, Dean Lei smiled and asked, “Did you gain anything from Thunder Courtyard?”

“I’ve gained a lot. I’ve exchanged for the Thunder Mystical Technique,” Qin Yu answered honestly.

Dean Lei was not surprised. He stroked his beard and said with a faint smile, “I knew you wouldn’t miss the opportunity to learn the Thunder Mystical Technique. Not only you but almost everyone in Thunder Courtyard would not miss the opportunity to learn it. Unfortunately, no one could comprehend this technique thus far.”

“Yes,” Qin Yu nodded and said. “I’ve also tried to comprehend this technique. But unfortunately, I can’t find any clues.”

“Hahaha!” Dean Lei couldn’t help but burst out laughing.

“I spent 300 years trying to figure out Thunder Mystical Technique,” he said indifferently. “If you can find the clue so quickly, I can no longer be the dean.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but be surprised.

He didn’t expect even Dean Lei to need to spend several hundred years comprehending it!

“What about Flower Granny?” Qin Yu asked.

“She took 500 years,” Dean Lei said.

Qin Yu was even more surprised! There were many legends about Flower Granny. Rumor had it that if it weren’t for her Dao companion, she would probably have reached the Tribulation Stage cultivation realm by now!

It showed Flower Granny’s talent was not something an ordinary person could compare. It even could be said that her talent was not weaker than anyone in the Holy Region.

But despite her talent, she needed a longer time to comprehend Thunder Mystical Technique than Dean Lei!

Dean Lei seemed to have seen through Qin Yu’s confusion. Therefore, he said indifferently, “Don’t be surprised. I’m the descendant of Immortal Emperor Lei, after all. I have his blood in my body. Naturally, I’ll need a shorter time to comprehend the technique.”

Upon hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but say in a low voice, “As expected. It seems that I guessed it right.”

“Oh?” Dean Lei’s brows twitched as if he was surprised.

“To be honest. I’ve thought about this problem,” Qin Yu explained. “And I came to visit you today regarding this matter.”

Dean Lei remained silent, signaling Qin Yu to continue.

“Would it be easier for the next generations to comprehend the techniques of their ancestors? Or they even don’t have to comprehend them?” Qin Yu asked with a frown.

Dean Lei nodded slightly and said, “That’s right. They can directly comprehend most of the techniques. They don’t have to spend too much time comprehending them. It is also why the descendants of aristocratic families are usually more powerful, and the aristocratic families can carry on for so long.”

“As expected.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

“If this goes on, I’m afraid it’ll be hard for ordinary cultivators to have a chance to stand out,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Dean Lei nodded slightly and said, “That’s right. Those who can stand out are often outstanding talents among the people. It’s rare, and it’s also the reason Thunder Courtyard is keeping talents.”

Qin Yu was stunned. He looked at Dean Lei and suddenly realized.

...

The existence of Thunder Academy was indeed a chance for rogue cultivators to come into contact with top-notch techniques!

But soon, Qin Yu was somewhat lost.

“But this Thunder Academy… It seems it only accepts a very small number of talented people, and the conditions are extremely stringent,” Qin Yu said with a frown.

Dean Lei glanced at Qin Yu, shook his head, and said, “This is inevitable. After all, the resources are limited. If everyone can come to Thunder Courtyard to comprehend techniques, it will cause everyone to not able to comprehend.”

Qin Yu thought for a while and felt that it made sense.

In the world, there was probably no one else who could do this other than Immortal Emperor Lei.

For example, outsiders wouldn’t even have the chance to take a peek at the techniques of the nine great aristocratic families, let alone comprehend them.

“Of course, nothing is absolute. Some techniques require the next generation to comprehend, but with higher success rates. For example, Thunder Mystical Technique, and also the Si family’s life-and-death diagram,” Dean Lei changed the subject and said.
