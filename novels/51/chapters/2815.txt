Unfortunately, the Alester family would not expose their tracks for the sake of safety now.

“Due to the suppression of the Saint Kingdom, there shouldn’t be any major conflicts for the time being. However, it will be time for the real war once there are traces of the Investiture of Gods, or if these outsiders obtain the Heart of Saint Kingdom. Thus, you should speed up if you have any thoughts.”

Cang Yunzi’s words had a hidden meaning. From his point of view, Qin Yu and the others should have obtained the Situ family’s incomplete page.

Moreover, one of them must be the Little Fatty of the Situ family.

Although the four of them had completely changed their internal qi, the jade talisman he had left with Qin Yu was still intact.

That was why Wang Da could use the jade talisman to sense him. With the information combined, it was not difficult to determine the general situation of Qin Yu and the others.

After chatting with Cang Yunzi, almost half a day had passed.

“What do you plan to do next?”

Aiden hesitated for a moment before saying. It wasn’t appropriate for them to stay together now.

Firstly, they were a big target. The information about them entering the Situ family should have been collected long ago. The four of them together would still attract attention.

On the other hand, they had to avoid being wiped out all at once. According to the worst-case scenario, they should had the tinder to keep from being wiped out.

“I plan to head to the Endless Mine. The leader of the Guardian of Order stations there. I will obtain the Heart of Saint Kingdom from him. When the time comes, I will be useful in battle. My strength is too weak now! Moreover, I’ve obtained the item left behind by the previous holy body owner, Ye Qiubai. I have to familiarize myself with some things as soon as possible.”

Chang Mang clenched his fists as he spoke. In this battle, he was going to face the top experts of the Saint World. This made him feel a sense of powerlessness that he had never felt before.

“Fatty Situ gave me information about the Night Elves. They are the strongest fighting force of our elven race. I need to visit them. Now that my peak power has awakened, I have to familiarize myself with the skills of the elven race if I want to become stronger.”

Aiden had already made up his mind.

Between level nine and level ten was the threshold of awakening.

However, it would take a long time to accumulate once the peak power was awakened.

Even if one were to reach the Holy Consciousness, one would still need to accumulate time to reach this level step by step.

This process was very difficult to cross, so he had to find other ways if he wanted to increase his strength quickly.

The two of them left immediately after leaving the jade pendants for communication.

“What about you two, holy daughter and Fatty Situ?”

“Of course, I’m going with you. Although I’m not strong enough, I still have at least half of the Situ family’s treasures on me. I won’t hold you back, Boss!”

Fatty Situ quickly said.

What a joke! Now that the most precious Investiture of Gods had already been given to Qin Yu. If he did not ride his coattails, wouldn’t he suffer a huge loss?

“Fatty Situ, you might not have a good ending if you follow me. Think carefully before you decide.”Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Qin Yu said unhappily.

“I know. Why are you as naggy as my father? I hold to my words. I will pester you even if I die.”

Fatty Situ said shamelessly.

“I plan to search for those scattered Hearts of Saint Kingdom. I was born in this world, so I can roughly sense their location. If you need them, I can give them to you when the time comes.”

Meng Jing said softly.

After the holy daughter left, only Qin Yu and Fatty Situ were left.

Qin Yu was also having a headache now. If he could not solve the problem of the power of the Investiture of Gods, then his existence here would be meaningless.

As long as his strength exceeded a certain threshold, it would probably attract attention just like the bugs on Earth.

This was because those bodies that had lost the will could not exert a huge power in an unconscious state. Once they exceeded the limit, they would attract the attention of the Investiture of Gods’ owner.

Previously, Qin Yu’s One Thought Reincarnation had already triggered a warning. If it happened again, Qin Yu worried that he would be flagged. It would be extremely difficult for him to do even a small thing at that time.

“Forget it. Let’s leave this place first.”

Qin Yu shook his head. It was not appropriate for them to stay here for long.

Otherwise, it would be bad for Cang Yunzi once the news was leaked.

“Daoist Priest, we shall part ways here! I hope we can meet again one day.”

After making the decision, Qin Yu directly bid farewell to Cang Yunzi.

“Qin Yu, the vastness of the Saint World is something that even the Holy Lord would find difficult to explore. This also involves many unimaginable powers, including the Heavenly Sin that we encountered previously. These are all existences that can contend with the power of the Investiture of Gods. If you need my help, just come and find me. I picked up this lifespan by accident anyway. Hahahaha!”

Cang Yunzi’s voice came from behind.

Cang Yunzi had long known about Qin Yu facing the power of the Investiture of Gods.

The curse power of the Investiture of Gods was recorded in many ancient books.

Seeing that Qin Yu was about to leave, he could not help but comfort him.

“Don’t worry, Taoist Priest. I won’t give up.”

Qin Yu felt a warm current in his heart.

To be able to make such a declaration at this time, there was no need to explain this kind of friendship.

“Boss, where should we go now?”

After leaving Cang Yunzi’s residence, Fatty Situ suddenly became confused.

“I want to go to the Divine Silkworm Ridge.”

Qin Yu took out the map and pointed to one of the places.

Cang Yunzi gave him this map previously. It was detailed information about the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom.

Moreover, the danger level was marked with different colors.

Black represented the most dangerous and unexplored places.

The Divine Silkworm Ridge was a place marked in black. This place was northeast of the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom.

“Divine Silkworm Ridge is not a good place! There seem to be many wormholes below the place. The Starry Sandworm appeared before came from this place. It then entered the Endless Mines of the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom to devour the Saint Crystals.”

Fatty Situ frowned when he heard the name.

The reason why the Situ family could become the wealthiest aristocratic family was also related to their powerful intelligence network.

They could obtain the incomplete page was also because someone from the Nine Nether Cliff had spread the news at the first moment.

Only then the Situ family could seize the initiative and obtain one of the Investiture of Gods.

Therefore, the Situ family had already collected this information.

“Wormhole? Wasn’t the entire Saint Kingdom enveloped by the crystal wall? Why would there be a wormhole?”

Qin Yu was somewhat puzzled.
