1931 Good-for-Nothing

The Si family’s spending style was indeed beyond the imagination of ordinary people.

To capture Qin Yu, they sent a Semi-Saint.

Qin Yu looked at Gu Xinghe, still as calm as ever.

“Can you make me another pot of tea?” Qin Yu said with a smile.

Gu Xinghe’s face darkened as he sneered and said, “You still have the mood to drink tea?”

“What’s wrong?” Qin Yu said with a faint smile. “Are you afraid I’ll run away?”

Gu Xinghe opened his mouth and was about to speak when the Semi-Saint waved his hand and said, “Let him drink.”

Gu Xinghe had no choice but to brew a new pot of tea for Qin Yu.

Qin Yu took a sip and shook his head. “Gu Xinghe, you really think too highly of me. Did you only dare to shed all pretense of cordiality after bringing a Semi-Saint?”

Gu Xinghe laughed heartily and said, “This is called ‘foolproof’. Moreover, I need to have a witness for what you’re saying.”

“It looks like you don’t have a good position in the Si family,” Qin Yu spread his hands and said. “No one seems to believe you.”

“Nonsense!” Gu Xinghe said furiously.

Qin Yu squinted his eyes and said coldly, “Gu Xinghe, you really did not make any progress after all these years. Your father had to put in so much effort to send you to the Holy Region, but you’re playing the role of a dog.”

“You’re courting death!” Gu Xinghe was furious. He took a step forward, and his internal qi suddenly burst forth.

At this moment, the Semi-Saint waved his hand and sat opposite Qin Yu. He said indifferently, “I heard you’re also from that so-called Earth?”

“That’s right.” Qin Yu didn’t try to hide.

“Are you also a chaotic body?” the Semi-Saint continued to ask.

“Yes,” Qin Yu answered without hesitation.

Speaking of this, Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said with a smile, “Why? Does your Si family’s Holy Son feel threatened because I have a physique similar to him? Aren’t you afraid of being laughed at by the outsiders if you attack me?”

The Semi-Saint took a sip of tea and said indifferently, “In fact, if it’s merely the same physique, we have no reason to attack you. But now we have.”

After saying that, the Semi-Saint’s face suddenly turned cold, and killing intent burst out.

“The fact that you dare to covet Saintess Yan is enough for us to attack you! I don’t think the outsiders will say anything,” the Semi-Saint said coldly.

“This is simply ridiculous!” Qin Yu laughed and said. “Is Si Shiyue the only person who can like Saintess Yan? It’s a capital offense when I like her. Many people in this world admire her. Is your Si family going to kill everyone in this world?”

His words were so powerful that the Si family’s Semi-Saint didn’t know what to say.

Gu Xinghe, standing at the side, saw this and hurriedly said, “Don’t listen to his nonsense. Be careful not to fall into his trap!”

The Semi-Saint also came to his senses and said coldly, “Admiration is different from liking. You want to possess Saintess Yan!

“Who wouldn’t want to possess her?” Qin Yu asked.

“But they don’t have a chance.”

“Oh, so you’re saying that I have a chance?”

The Semi-Saint fell into silence again, not knowing how to respond.

“Don’t listen to his nonsense. Just kill him!” Gu Xinghe urged impatiently.

Qin Yu glanced at Gu Xinghe and said sarcastically, “What? Don’t you want to take revenge personally?”

“As long as you die, it doesn’t matter who kills you,” Gu Xinghe said coldly.

“Good-for-nothing,” Qin Yu laughed and said.

He glanced at the magical artifacts hanging high up in the air and said indifferently, “In fact, these magical artifacts are enough to kill me. Why are you so cautious? I’m just a small Early-stage Reversion Void cultivator.

Gu Xinghe narrowed his eyes and said, “I want to make sure you die in one go!”

Upon hearing this, Qin Yu immediately stood up.

He looked at Gu xXnghe coldly and said, “I’ll give you a chance now. You can attack me, and I promise I won’t fight back. How about it?”

Gu Xinghe was stunned. He looked at Qin Yu, frowned, and said, “What are you up to this time?”

“Nothing, just make your move,” Qin Yu said while walking forward.

Gu Xinghe’s face was suddenly filled with panic, and he did not even dare to look Qin Yu in the eye.

Seeing Qin Yu getting closer, Gu Xinghe felt even more panic.

“Make your move!” Qin Yu was smiling, but there seemed to be sarcasm hidden in his smile.

However, Gu Xinghe did not seem to have any intention to attack. Instead, he kept retreating.

In his mind, Qin Yu must be playing some kind of trick!

“Make your move!” Qin Yu suddenly shouted.

Gu Xinghe lost his balance and fell onto the ground.

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh, “Is this the city lord of Serene South City? How embarrassing! he didn’t even dare to attack me. What a good-for-nothing!”

The Semi-Saint’s expression was extremely unsightly. His face was dark, and he seemed extremely dissatisfied with Gu Xinghe.

“If you don’t dare to make a move, I’ll do it!” the general-in-chief seemed to have seized the opportunity and immediately stepped forward!

Anyone with a discerning eye knew the general-in-chief’s intention. He wanted to use this opportunity to show off and rise to the top!

Feeling not right, Gu Xinghe hurriedly shouted, “Don’t!”

Unfortunately, the general-in-chief did not want to miss this opportunity. His palm was like an eagle’s claw, ruthlessly smacking toward Qin Yu’s head!

Just as Qin Yu had said, he stood there without moving and let the slap hit his head.

...

With a crisp crack sound, Qin Yu’s head was smashed by his palm!

Qin Yu’s body fell to the ground. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

He was lying on the ground, blood flowing all over.

Gu Xinghe was confused. Everyone was stunned.

Did Qin Yu die just like this?

“No… It can’t be!” Gu Xinghe was instantly flustered. If he had known this would happen, he would not have been so afraid!

If he were the one who made the move, not only would he take his revenge, but the Si family would also appreciate him.

However, he missed such an opportunity because of the cowardice in his heart!

The general-in-chief was tremendously excited. He cupped his hands and said, “Qin Yu is dead!”

The Semi-Saint didn’t say a word. He took a sip of tea, sighed, and said slowly, “We’ve indeed underestimated him.”

The general-in-chief was stunned and asked in confusion, “What do you mean by that?

...

The Semi-Saint glanced at Qin Yu’s body and said coldly, “Look carefully. What is that?”

Everyone looked over and saw that Qin Yu’s body had turned into a rune!

“How could it be? It… It’s a clone!” The general-in-chief was dumbfounded, while Gu Xinghe had mixed feelings in his heart.

Qin Yu didn’t die. Thus he could still safeguard his position. But… He missed another chance to take revenge.

“I told you this kid is extremely cunning!” Gu Xinghe took the opportunity to glare at the general-in-chief.

“It’s my fault, the Semi-Saint said, waving his hand. “I actually didn’t see through it.”
