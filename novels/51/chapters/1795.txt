1796 Dangerous Missions

The resources of Thunder Courtyard were more terrifying than he had imagined. No wonder it was a unique existence in Lizhou!

Of course, these cultivation techniques were not created by Immortal Emperor Lei. They were added on by his descendants.

Only the eighth floor of the Thunder Academy had the true inheritance of the Immortal Emperor.

Qin Yu didn’t waste any time. He kept looking for Meridian Circulation Technique in the academy.

!!

In less than half an hour, Qin Yu had taken a fancy to more than ten cultivation techniques.

Each cultivation technique was extremely tempting to Qin Yu, and it only required 20 or so points!

Looking at the dazzling array of cultivation techniques, Qin Yu’s heart palpitated with excitement and he kept swallowing his saliva!

These resources were even more than those of the aristocratic families in ZhongZhou!

Every few steps he took, Qin Yu had the urge to make a move. However, when he recalled the pain of being tortured by his inner demons, he resisted it in the end.

After going around the first floor, Qin Yu didn’t find the Meridian Circulation Technique he was looking for. Therefore he immediately went to the second floor.

Compared to the first floor, the cultivation techniques and Meridian Circulation Techniques on the second floor were naturally more precious. Many of them were even created by the great cultivators of the Tribulation Stage. They were extremely precious.

However, Qin Yu still could not find the Meridian Circulation Technique that he wanted on the second floor.

It was until Qin Yu arrived on the third floor.

In a corner on the third floor, Qin Yu finally saw this Meridian Circulation Technique.

The name of the Meridian Circulation Technique was called Pure in Heart Sutra. It was extremely effective in controlling one’s mind.

Qin Yu couldn’t wait to look at the Pure in Heart Sutra. He was extremely excited.

However, when he took out the token, he realized that it required 100 points!

This instantly gave Qin Yu a headache.

“It’s so costly.” Qin Yu frowned.

Even if he counted in Jue Wu’s points, Qin Yu was still short of 50-plus points.

“Forget it. Let’s see if there are any other Meridian Circulation Techniques,” thought Qin Yu.

Therefore, Qin Yu continued his search.

However, he soon realized that the points required on the third floor were almost all around 100. Some even required 200 points!

This made Qin Yu’s originally excited heart sink.

“At this rate, I’m afraid it will take a long time to get the Pure in Heart Sutra.” Qin Yu sighed slightly.

If he could not control his inner demons, his cultivation would be affected, let alone making a breakthrough.

After much thought, Qin Yu had no other way except to borrow points from others.

However, this was also unrealistic. No one was willing to give up their points so easily.

“Sigh!” Qin Yu let out a long sigh, feeling a headache.

“It seems like I can only go back and slowly accumulate points,” thought Qin Yu.

No matter what, this trip wasn’t in vain. At least he had found a Meridian Circulation Technique.

“I wonder what kind of terrifying cultivation techniques will be there if I go further up,” thought Qin Yu.

Therefore, Qin Yu walked up to the fourth floor with curiosity.

The points required on the fourth floor were even more terrifying. Some cultivation techniques even required 500 or so points!

Of course, the cultivation techniques on the fourth floor were even more precious and alluring. These cultivation techniques were probably not the slightest inferior to the Meridian Circulation Techniques of the offspring of the aristocratic families in ZhongZhou.

Therefore, Qin Yu went to the fifth floor.

However, when he arrived at the fifth floor, he found the door leading to the fifth floor was locked.

A formation was set up at the entrance, so no one could step in.

Qin Yu frowned and said in a low voice, “Could it be that we can only exchange for the cultivation techniques from the first four floors? Or are the floors from the fifth and above not open to the public?”

Qin Yu tried to reach out his hand to the door that led to the fifth floor.

However, the moment the hand touched, Qin Yu was sent flying by a powerful force! Even his palm seemed to get burnt!

“Looks like the fifth floor isn’t open to the public,” thought Qin Yu.

He looked at the fifth floor curiously and said in a low voice, “I wonder what’s on the fifth floor and above.”

Qin Yu didn’t think much and immediately walked to the door.

When he reached the door, he found the two people who had brought Qin Yu in were still there.

Therefore, Qin Yu walked forward, cupped his hands, and said, “May I ask the two seniors, is the fifth floor and above not open to the public?”

The two men glanced at Qin Yu and said, “To enter the fifth floor, one must be at the Reversion Void Stage. To enter the sixth floor, one must be at the True Saint Stage, and so on.”

Qin Yu could not help but gasp!

The sixth floor required the True Saint cultivation realm. What about the seventh and eighth floors? Wouldn’t he need to reach an even more terrifying cultivation realm?

“Don’t think about it. Anything above the sixth floor has nothing to do with you for the time being.” The two of them seemed to have noticed Qin Yu’s shock, so they immediately said indifferently.

Qin Yu came back to his senses and continued asking, “Senior, what’s on the sixth floor?”

The two didn’t try to hide anything and said indifferently, “Meridian Circulation Techniques, cultivation techniques, and magical artifacts.

“You don’t have to know so much. You only need to know that the Saint Weapons are on the fifth floor.”

Qin Yu became even more excited after hearing that!

The fifth floor actually had Saint Weapons! Saint artifacts were extremely precious. If one could get their hands on one, it was enough for him to do whatever he wanted in Holy Region!

“Of course, this Saint Weapon can only be rented. Each time of use costs at least 1,000 points.” The two then poured cold water on Qin Yu.

Hearing this, Qin Yu instantly felt extremely embarrassed.

One thousand points, in the entire Demon-slaying Peak, probably no one was as rich except Jiu Xiao.

“Alright, we have to go now,” the two men said.

Qin Yu responded to them and didn’t say anything else. However, he was a little excited.

If he could rent a Saint Weapon, then it might help fight the so-called Tong family.

After leaving the Mystic Realm with these two people, Qin Yu rode the Divine Eagle and returned to the Demon-slaying Peak.

In the cave abode.

When Jue Wu saw Qin Yu, she ran over excitedly.

“How is it? Did you find it?” Jue Wu asked.

“Yes,” Qin Yu said with a bitter smile. “But I don’t have enough points. I need to have 100 points.”

“Wow! So many.” Jue Wu’s eyebrows slightly furrowed.

“It doesn’t matter. With our speed, it won’t take long for us to reach it,” Jue Wu comforted him and said.

“I guess I’ll have to borrow your points for now,” Qin Yu sighed.

“Why are you telling me this?” Jue Wu hit Qin Yu with her small hand.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly. Although she said so, how could he not feel guilty? Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The following day.

Demon-slaying Peak issued another mission.

Many cultivators had arrived at the cave abode that received missions early. Qin Yu and Jue Wu were no exception.

They stood at the door and waited quietly. After a while, Xioabai also arrived.

Qin Yu quickly walked over and said with a smile, “Xiaobai, why are you so late this time?”

“I didn’t even plan to come,” Xiaobai said with her hands spread out.

“Eh? Why?” Qin Yu said in surprise.

Xiaobai looked around and said softly, “The missions this time are all extremely dangerous. Most probably we will lose our lifes.”
