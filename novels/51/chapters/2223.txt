2224 Man with the Mustache Appears

It would be tremendously disadvantageous for them to fight for the demonic ginseng later.

“Outrageous! I saw you clearly.”

Xuan Yuan was furious.

“Your Majesty, it was those cultivators who attacked you.”

A six-tailed fox said softly.

“Great, it’s you guys!”

Xuan Yuan looked at Zong Yue with a ferocious and grim smile.

The expressions of Zong Yue and the others changed drastically.

A group of cultivators protecting Zong Yue were about to face Xuan Yuan.

“Crack!”

Suddenly, there was a sound of a cracking eggshell.

At this moment, a layer of fine cracks appeared on the eggshell outside the ginseng.

When a hole appeared, somebody could no longer wait and made his move immediately.

The moment the giant hand phantom reached in, an axe directly chopped it off.

The cultivator spat blood and retreated.

“Little ones, charge and cover me as I get the demonic ginseng.”

Under Xuan Yuan’s command, the demonic beasts seemed to have gone mad and madly attacked the human cultivators.

Qin Yu frowned. Usually, demonic beasts were more disordered, and humans had to rely on coordination to defeat demonic beasts.

However, after the demonic ginseng appeared, greed enveloped everyone and forced the humans to retreat like scattered sand.

Nonetheless, some human cultivators firmly occupied several locations near the ginseng.

They were the evil exterminator, Zong Yue, Wu Feng, a few teams formed by cultivators, and Qin Yu.

Demonic beasts had piled up higher than mountains around these locations. Those demonic beasts that had a little intelligence chose to avoid these Asura.

Suddenly, Qin Yu’s gaze turned toward a person in white.

Besides Qin Yu, he was the only person here.

“Xi Men!”

The swordsman was sitting on the ground with his eyes closed.

The demonic beasts within a hundred feet of him were almost instantly shaved into white bone, and the terrifying sword intent was dense.

“Boom!”

With a loud thunderous roar, two massive thunderclouds slowly collided.

The sky was like a surging black river, and a massive vortex appeared at the top of the ginseng.

The massive vortex emerged slowly and soon expanded to several hundred feet wide.

One, two, three, four…

Soon, hundreds of massive vortexes appeared in the sea of lightning.

This lightning tribulation seemed a hundred times more terrifying than his breakthrough into the True Saint Realm. Was this the backlash of a plant turning into a demon?

It was too difficult!

He thought of the daffodil girl and Elder Guai. They must have gone through such a near-death experience to survive.

Not only did it have to survive such a terrifying lightning tribulation, but there were also humans and demonic beasts who wanted to fight for it.

“That’s right! However, these supreme treasures were just like human cultivators fighting for the fortune of heaven and earth. Therefore, the lightning tribulation would be even more terrifying. After killing them, their vital energy would return to heaven and earth, and it’s the Great Dao of heaven and earth.”

A familiar voice sighed with emotion beside Qin Yu. The man with the mustache stood with a lofty and imposing demeanor, hands behind his back, appearing like a mysterious and eminent expert.

“It’s you? F*ck, why did you show up here?”

Qin Yu grabbed the man with the mustache and pulled his face. He was indeed the man with the mustache.

Soon he came back to his senses.

“I’ve long arrived. Even if treasures emerge tens of thousands of miles away, none can escape my divination.”

The man with the mustache pushed Qin Yu’s hands away unhappily.

“Hurry up and snatch this ginseng. We’ll split it equally.”

“You dream!”

The man with the mustache still maintained his habit of speaking bluntly.

“You must have made some preparations. Quickly tell me.”

Qin Yu grabbed the collar of the man with the mustache again.

Whenever this guy appeared, he was well-prepared. This time, he had been lying in ambush for god knew how long.

“To be honest, a few fellows are here who are not to be trifled with. I discovered them when I set up the formation in advance, but they didn’t make any moves. I really don’t know how these freaks emerged on this land of exile.”

The man with the mustache finally got serious. He glanced at the evil exterminator.

“Cooperate with me later. It’s sufficient to obtain a wisp of the demonic ginseng’s soul. This ginseng is at least 30,000 years old and has comprehended the complete power of the way. Even a wisp of its soul is more useful than its body.”

“F*ck! You’re even aware of this!”

Qin Yu was tremendously shocked. Almost everyone had tacitly agreed to plunder the demonic ginseng’s body and inner core. He did not expect the power of the divine soul to have such an important effect.

“Nonsense! I also have a secret technique that can refine the power of rules. It will be of great use when you enter the fifth grade!”

The man with the mustache rolled his eyes at Qin Yu.

“Okay, okay. Don’t hide anything from me, or I’ll beat you up.”

Qin Yu quickly said. The origin of this man with the mustache was indeed too mysterious. Although he had never cheated Qin Yu, this feeling of not being able to grasp anything still made Qin Yu feel uneasy.

“I spent half a month setting up the soul-sucking formation. When the time comes, I’ll take the body of the demonic ginseng if I can. If I can’t, I’ll give it to someone else. When you activate the formation, you must cover me well.”

The man with the mustache man said with a solemn expression.

At this moment, almost all the cultivators had retreated outside the thunderclouds.

If they were within the range of the lightning tribulation, they would be seen as helpers by the rules of heaven and earth and would also be attacked by the lightning tribulation.

“Boom!”

The lightning tribulation that was thousands of feet in size struck the ginseng.

A cute little kid yawned and swallowed the thundercloud.

Incredibly pure vital energy filled the entire space, quickly repairing the injuries caused by the lightning tribulation.

“Boom!”

Another bolt of lightning struck down.

At this moment, the demonic ginseng had already revealed its true form. Its roots were like giant snakes that lashed at the lightning tribulation.

In an instant, wood shavings flew everywhere, and its true body shattered.

The ginseng returned to its original state instantly.

A ferocious face appeared in the thunderclouds. Various strange animals on the face formed its facial features.

“This is the face of the lightning tribulation. The appearance of this ginseng has caused heaven and earth to feel a sense of danger. It is probably the final strike.”

The several hundreds of vortexes in the sky suddenly accelerated. In the next moment, a lightning pillar of several thousand feet struck the ghost’s face in the middle with ear-deafening thunder. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

A lightning pillar that was tens of thousands of feet long suddenly descended.

The entire purgatory instantly turned into daytime. Countless demonic beasts trembled in front of this heavenly tribulation.

This was the might of heaven and earth!

The demonic ginseng seemed to have sensed the danger of its life. All the roots and enormous tentacles on its body slammed into the lightning tribulation.

However, in the instant of contact, all of its limbs shattered. And the incredibly pure vital energy repaired its body again.

The terrifying life force was almost condensed into a liquid, almost instantly repairing the ginseng’s body.

However, almost in a breath, the lightning tribulation suppressed that body into dust.

The Great Dao of heaven and earth did not allow anyone to intervene.

“It’s over. This demonic ginseng can’t resist this heavenly tribulation at all. If this lightning tribulation continues, its divine soul will turn into dust. These few months have been wasted.”

The man with the mustache sighed repeatedly.
