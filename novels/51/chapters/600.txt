Chapter 601: Rumors of the Immortal Slaying Sect Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

He Teng frowned.

In this way, he wasn’t considered to have joined the Jingdu Martial Arts Association at all. Instead, he was going to become a scapegoat for the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

“You no longer have the right to go back on your words,” Yan Guiyi said coldly.

At this point, Yan Guiyi changed the topic and said with a nonchalant smile, “Of course, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association will givee the best resources to you.”

He Teng’s eyes lost focus, and a black light flashed through his eyes. Then, He Teng’s expression suddenly changed.

He opened his mouth and said with a sinister smile, “Okay... I’ll agree to it...”

Yan Guiyi frowned, as if he felt something was wrong, but he didn’t think too much about it and just nodded.

Led by Yan Guiyi, the group swam underwater.

The group of more than a dozen people passed through the sea and soon arrived at the bottom of the island.

Looking at the inner core attached to the bottom of the island, everyone was shocked for a moment.

“This is... inner core!” Yan Jinyao’s eyes dilated, and his eyes shone with excitement.

Even Yan Guiyi was shocked. He didn’t expect that there would be so many inner cores under the island!

“As expected of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. Even if we searched our whole lives for it, we might not be able to get it,” someone said in a low voice.

Some people had even lost their minds from the excitement and pounced on it.

Yan Guiyi placed his hands behind his back and swept his gaze over the inner cores in front of him.

Soon, he found the main gate of the Immortal Slaying Sect.

“The Immortal Slaying Sect... is really here,” Yan Guiyi said coldly.

He waved his hand and said coldly, “Everyone, listen to my order and break into the Immortal Slaying Sect with me!”

After hearing Yan Guiyi’s words, they found the gate of the Immortal Slaying Sect in front of them.

“The Immortal Slaying Sect? What kind of sect is this? How come I’ve never heard of it?” The crowd looked up at the magnificent plaque and said in a low voice.

“This sect has probably existed for many years.”

Yan Guiyi swept his gaze across the crowd and coldly said, “The Immortal Slaying Sect was a sect from ten thousand years ago. Its level of danger is beyond imagination. Those who don’t want to die, follow me closely!”

After saying this, Yan Guiyi took the lead and walked into the main door.

Even Yan Guiyi was quite cautious. In the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, he had read the relevant information regarding the Immortal Slaying Sect. Compared to the others, Yan Guiyi had a better understanding of it.

Everyone followed behind Yan Guiyi and carefully walked toward the gate.

Yan Guiyi activated his inner strength and pushed the gate gently.

There was a hint of fear on his face, as if he was afraid of alerting something.

In the Immortal Slaying Sect, Qin Yu also noticed this abnormality.

“Someone is coming.” Qin Yu frowned.

In such a place, only Yan Guiyi and the others would come.

Qin Yu lowered his head and looked at the bracelet in his hand.

The bracelet still showed no signs of loosening.

“If they find me, I’m afraid I’ll die without a doubt.” Qin Yu frowned and his expression was somewhat unsightly.

At this moment, Qin Yu narrowed his eyes, as if he had thought of something.

Therefore, Qin Yu walked quickly to the chair of the sect master and sat down with his back facing the door.

“I hope they don’t find me,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

It took Yan Guiyi a long time to push open the door.

Cold sweat was dripping down his forehead. It could be seen that even though Yan Guiyi was in the middle stage of the Martial Marquis realm, he was still very vigilant against the Immortal Slaying Sect.

“Fortunately, it was a close call,” Yan Guiyi wiped the sweat off his forehead and said in a deep voice.

Seeing this, Yan Jinyao couldn’t help but ask, “Captain Yan, what’s the origin of the Immortal Slaying Sect? Why are you so nervous?”

Yan Guiyi glanced at Yan Jinyao and said coldly, “According to the information, the Immortal Slaying Sect used to be the number one sect in the world and it had tens of thousands of disciples.”

“The number one sect in the world?” Hearing this, everyone couldn’t help but be surprised.

Yan Guiyi nodded and said, “That was the number one sect ten thousand years ago. The cultivation environment at that time was very different from now.”

“It’s said that any disciple of the Immortal Slaying Sect was a Mighty Realm cultivator, and their sect master was even more powerful.”

Hearing Yan Guiyi’s words, everyone couldn’t help but turn pale with fright.

Any one of them was a Mighty Realm cultivator? What kind of sect was this? No wonder they dared to name it the Immortal Slaying Sect!

“For a sect like this, no one can guarantee that they won’t leave behind any trump cards or even create to any ominous objects,” Yan Guiyi said with some vigilance.

“Indeed. Large sects usually leave behind subsequent countermeasuress or even living creatures. We’d better be careful,” Yao Meng also said in a deep voice. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Captain Yan, how did such a prosperous sect collapse?” Someone asked in puzzlement.

Yan Guiyi said coldly, “It’s said that the Immortal Slaying Sect was massacred by an itinerant cultivator who had reached the Mighty Realm.”

“Massacred by an itinerant cultivator?” Everyone looked at each other in dismay.

A sect that was at its peak for a time could be massacred by an itinerant cultivator?

Yan Guiyi snorted lightly and said, “Of course, the credibility of this information isn’t high. How could such a top sect be massacred by an itinerant cultivator?”

Qin Yu, who was sitting on the chair, couldn’t help but sneer to himself.

Yan Guiyi was too cocky. He always thought that the upper class wouldn’t be challenged by ordinary people.

Unfortunately, those who broke the class barrier were usually ordinary people who had nothing.

“Everyone, be careful. Places like this are often fraught with danger,” Yan Guiyi reminded again.

Naturally, no one dared to be reckless. They followed closely behind Yan Guiyi and walked into the main hall.

There were still dry bones in the main hall, and the dark energy inside was bone-chilling.

Yan Guiyi was sweating profusely. Afraid that he would run into any danger, he released his divine sense.

“Whoosh!”

At this moment, a gust of cold wind blew past, and everyone couldn’t help but shiver.

Yan Guiyi, who was in a state of panic, suddenly shivered and unconsciously took two steps back. He exclaimed, “Ancestor, we didn’t mean to offend you. Please show mercy!”

His face full of nervousness, Yan Guiyi cupped his hands.

However, there was only a gust of cold wind in the hall. How could there be any “ancestor”?

The atmosphere was a little awkward, and some people couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“Don’t laugh!” Yan Guiyi shouted.

“Let me tell you, if any creatures appear here, we will die without a doubt!” Yan Guiyi said coldly.

“So this is the big shot of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. He’s so afraid of death,” Chang Mang said with a sneer.

He didn’t like Yan Guiyi to begin with. Now that he had such an opportunity, he naturally couldn’t help but ridicule him.

Yan Jinyao narrowed his eyes and said indifferently, “An ant like you who was born at the bottom doesn’t know what it means to be in a prosperous sect. Ignorant people are fearless.”

“F * ck you! You’re full of bullsh*t. Since you’re so timid, why don’t you go home and hide in your mother’s arms? Don’t come out,” Chang Mang scolded him mercilessly.
