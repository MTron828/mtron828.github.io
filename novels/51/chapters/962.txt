Chapter 963: Chapter 963, Gu Xinghe’s treacherous scheme

Qin Yu looked at Jiang he eagerly, his eyes filled with anticipation.

However, Jiang he shook his head and said, “Since you already know how to comprehend the DAO, you should understand that only by comprehending your own path can you become a martial saint.”

“Moreover, only you know your own path.”

Qin Yu was speechless.

That’s right, even he himself did not understand his own path, what more others?

“I understand.”Qin Yu nodded slightly.

“Comprehending Dao techniques is not a short process. Many people may spend decades or even a lifetime,”Jiang he said.

“Martial saints are like a fork in the road that decides which direction you want to go.”

Qin Yu stood up and nodded, “Yes, thank you for your guidance, Senior.”

After he finished speaking, Qin Yu left.

In the next few days.

Besides refining pills for Xu Huaigu, Qin Yu was also looking for his own path.

The news of Jiang he stepping into the martial saint realm also spread quickly.

This was like a heart-strengthening drug, causing everyone to heave a sigh of relief.

When the news of the battle at the nine Pinnacles Mountain spread out, everyone became even more excited!

“This is enough to prove that the martial saints who have emerged from the current era are even more powerful than the old martial saints in their secret realm!”

“As long as someone steps into the martial saint realm, he or she will be able to fight against ten of them alone!”

“I wonder who will be the next person to step into the Martial Saint Realm!”

While everyone was excited, Gu Xinghe came to the immortal slaying sect. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The immortal slaying sect looked extremely weak and was different from the top sects in their impression.

Besides the white bone army, there was only Tian Xuehong here.

“Why? Are You Looking for me?”Looking at Gu Xinghe who suddenly came to visit, Tian Xuehong opened his eyes slightly.

Gu Xinghe sat opposite Tian Xuehong. He played with a bead in front of him and said indifferently, “Don’t you want to devour a warrior’s spiritual sense? I have a good place to go.”

“Nine Pinnacles Mountain?”Tian Xuehong said with a faint smile.

Gu Xinghe was stunned and asked, “How do you know?”

Tian xuehong sneered, “Gu Xinghe, you want to use me as a spear? Do you think you are qualified?”

Gu Xinghe’s brows immediately furrowed tightly.

“Why? Are You Afraid?”Gu Xinghe raised his brows and asked.

Tian xuehong asked back, “If you aren’t afraid, Why don’t you go?”

“I don’t have your Skeleton Army. If you’re willing to lend me your skeleton army, I’ll flatten nine Pinnacles Mountain Tomorrow!”Gu Xinghe said coldly.

“Don’t Tell Me Your Skeleton Army is afraid of Jiang he?”

Tian xuehong snorted and said, “Jiang he is nothing in front of my skeleton army, but I won’t go to nine Pinnacles Mountain.”

“Why?”Gu Xinghe frowned.

Tian xuehong said indifferently, “Because there’s no need. I have already found the top-notch cultivation method of the immortal slaying sect.”

“Top-notch cultivation method? What is that?”Gu Xinghe continued to ask.

However, Tian Xuehong closed his eyes and seemed unwilling to answer this question.

Gu Xinghe did not ask for trouble. He snorted lightly and turned to leave.

After getting into the car, long mei asked, “Young Master Gu, How is it?”

Gu Xinghe snorted coldly, “This is more cowardly. It seems that his army of white bones is just an empty title!”

Long Mei said in a deep voice, “Then what should we do?”

Gu Xinghe narrowed his eyes and said, “There are some things that he can not do just because he doesn’t want to!”

“Since he doesn’t want to do it, then I will force him to do it!”

After he finished speaking, Gu Xinghe waved his hand and said, “Let’s start the car.”

In the immortal slaying sect, Tian Xuehong slowly opened his eyes.

With a wave of his hand, thirteen white bones appeared in front of him!

Each of these thirteen white bones had the ability to tear a martial saint apart!

Looking at the thirteen white bones in front of him, the smile on Tian Xuehong’s face became even wider.

He raised his hand, and the bodies of these thirteen white bones began to emit rays of light.

The light entered the center of Tian Xuehong’s brows, and a relaxed expression appeared on his face.

A moment later, the corner of Tian Xuehong’s mouth curled up into a cold smile.

“Back then, the immortal slaying sect used a secret technique to absorb the spiritual senses of tens of thousands of warriors and formed the Supreme Sect!”

“Today, I will imitate the Ancients and use a secret technique to form my supreme true body and step into the peak once again!”Tian Xuehong said with a heroic expression!

The reason why he didn’t need to step on the nine pinnacles mountain was because he had found the secret technique of the immortal slaying sect!

As long as he successfully laid down this secret technique, he could absorb the spiritual sense of martial artists on a large scale to become himself!

“Just you wait. All of you will become a part of my body!”Tian Xuehong grinned and revealed a cruel smile.

...

The nine pinnacles mountain was peaceful.

Many people followed behind Jiang he and learned spells from him.

Qin Yu was an exception. The spells he mastered were no less than Jiang he’s, so he didn’t need to learn.

Qin Yu spent most of his time looking for his own path of cultivation.

But every time Qin Yu closed his eyes, hundreds of paths appeared in front of him.

Every path was waving at Qin Yu.

Even Qin Yu himself could not figure out which path to take.

In just a few days, Qin Yu had become thinner.

Not only that, these few days, Qin Yu’s mouth kept bleeding from time to time.

The wound on the golden core in his body seemed to have expanded again.

“I’m really worried...”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

“After I find my own path, maybe I should go look for the heavenly vanilla,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

...

Jingdu martial arts association.

There was a person standing in Gu Xinghe’s office.

This person was exuding an eerie internal QI, and his body was wrapped in a black robe.

This person was none other than he teng!

“Young Master Gu, Why are you looking for me...”he teng became more and more sinister, making people shudder. Even Gu Xinghe felt a bit uncomfortable.

He frowned and said, “I want you to kill someone, but the scene of the murder must be made to look like Gu Xinghe did it.”

“In other words, I want you to absorb spiritual sense. Can you do it?”

He teng grinned and said, “For me... It’s easy. You just need to tell me who to kill...”

Gu Xinghe took out a document and threw it to he teng.

The document was filled with people’s names.

When he saw the names clearly, he Teng’s lips curled into a cold smile.

“So many people... Jingdu martial arts association, are they so bold now...”He Teng said darkly.

Gu Xinghe said with a gloomy face, “It’s not that Jingdu martial arts association is bold, it’s that tianxue Hong is bold.”

He Teng said with a faint smile, “I understand. I’ll do it tonight...”
