Chapter 549: Silence Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

A muscular man was walking over with big strides.

There were four to five other people beside him, and each of them was an Inner Strength Grandmaster!

The impersonator’s expression changed, and he immediately knew that things weren’t good!

He never expected that he had miscalculated! Wang Xiong had actually come a day earlier!

Wang Xiong swept his gaze across the crowd, and for a moment, no one dared to speak.

Then, his gaze landed on Zhen Yue.

“Sect Master Zhen, have you thought it through?” Wang Xiong said with a smile.

Zhen Yue’s expression changed. She gritted her teeth and said, “Mr. Wang, the Beaufort Tower was passed down from the Zhen family’s ancestors. It’s against the rules for you to occupy it like this...”

“Rules?” Wang Xiong snorted coldly and said, “Cut the crap! I’m telling you, I’m definitely going to take the Beaufort Tower!”

“And I’m telling you, this isn’t my idea, but an order from the Saint Confucian Sect!”

When they heard the words ‘Saint Confucian Sect’, everyone’s expression changed again!

The Saint Confucian Sect was the number one sect in the north, so why would they pay attention to this place?

“Sect Master Zhen, I discussed this with you because you’re pretty,” Wang Xiong said with a smile.

“How about this? You can be my woman, and I promise to give you a lavish life!”

Zhen Yue gritted her teeth, and her expression was extremely ugly.

Wang Xiong looked at Zhen Yue lecherously and he was almost drooling.

Zhen Yue was wearing a black mini skirt with a V-neck shirt, which outlined her figure perfectly.

And Zhen Yue was a famous beauty in Jade City, and was known as the number one beauty in Jade City! No one wouldn’t be tempted!

“How is it? Have you thought it through?” Wang Xiong said with a smile.

Zhen Yue gritted her teeth and looked at the imposter beside her.

“Wang Xiong, don’t be too arrogant. So what if it’s the Saint Confucian Sect?!” At this moment, the person beside Zhen Yue shouted.

He pointed at the imposter and berated, “Do you know who this is? He is the famous Qin Yu! With Mr. Qin around, the Saint Confucian Sect can forget about it!”

When they heard the name Qin Yu, Wang Xiong and the others’expressions changed drastically!

“You’re Qin Yu?” Wang Xiong asked.

The impostor’s expression changed. He saw a trace of fear flash across Wang Xiong’s face.

Therefore, he simply braced himself and said, “That’s right, I’m Qin Yu! Sect Master Zhen is my friend. Please leave quickly and don’t have any more ideas about snatching the Beaufort Tower.”

Wang Xiong frowned.

He had heard of Qin Yu’s name before. He was someone that even the sect master of the Saint Confucian Sect couldn’t do anything about!

Just as Wang Xiong was about to speak, the person next to him suddenly snorted and said, “Everyone says that Qin Yu is so powerful. I think it’s just hype!”

As he spoke, the person took a step forward and looked at the imposter.

“You’re Qin Yu, right? I’ve heard so much about you. I’ve always wanted to see for myself if you’re really that legendary!”

The imposter’s expression suddenly changed!

He braced himself and said, “I think there’s no need for that...”

“Hehe, why? Are you afraid? It seems that your victory over Han Wei was indeed fake!” The person said coldly.

The imposter’s expression turned extremely ugly. He subconsciously looked at Wang Xiong.

However, Wang Xiong didn’t show any reaction. It seemed that he also wanted to see “Qin Yu’s” abilities.

“Qin Yu, make your move. Let me see just how impressive you are!” The Inner Strength Grandmaster beside Wang Xiong shouted and then clenched his fist!

Since things had already come to this point, the imposter could only brace himself and go forward to confront him.

Golden light flashed on his body, and he immediately clenched his fist to fight head-on!

The moment he made contact, the golden light on the imposter’s body instantly exploded, and his arm was bent at a strange angle!

When everyone saw this, they were instantly stunned.

The legendary invincible Qin Yu was actually so weak?!

“Hahahaha!” Wang Xiong couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“So Qin Yu is just a nobody! He can’t even defeat an Inner Strength Grandmaster!”

Zhen Yue and the others’ expressions turned even uglier!

Didn’t they say that Qin Yu was a half-step Martial Marquis?! How could he be so weak?!

“I didn’t expect that Qin Yu would die at my hands!” Wang Xiong stepped forward and said coldly.

The imposter panicked immediately. He knelt on the ground and begged for mercy, “Mr. ... Mr. Wang, I’m not Qin Yu at all. Please... Please spare me...”

“You’re not Qin Yu?” Zhen Yue frowned immediately.

Since things had come to this, the imposter didn’t dare to lie anymore.

He braced himself and said, “I. . . I said I was Qin Yu because I was lusting after Zhen Yue’s beauty...”

“I thought you would come tomorrow. As long as I run away early tomorrow, everything will be fine... but I didn’t expect you to come early...”

Zhen Yue stomped her feet angrily.

She pointed at the imposter and scolded, “You b*stard!”

Wang Xiong sneered. “Zhen Yue, why would the real Qin Yu help you?”

A trace of sadness flashed across Zhen Yue’s face.

Yes, Qin Yu was a person who challenged the Yan family. Why would he help her?

At this moment, Wang Xiong suddenly stretched out his palm, and a ray of light smashed the head of the imposter!

The sudden change of events immediately scared Zhen Yue and the others so much that their faces turned pale.

“Sect Master Zhen, you’d better obey me...” Wang Xiong said with a lecherous look.

“Mr. Wang, don’t forget what the higher-ups told you,” someone reminded him at this moment.

Wang Xiong frowned and glanced at Zhen Yue unwillingly. Then, he said, “Sect Master Zhen, wait for me obediently. I’ll come back to dote on you after I’m done.”

Zhen Yue’s expression was pale, but she didn’t dare to say anything.

Then, Wang Xiong looked at the lake in front of him.

“The Saint Confucian Sect must be talking about this place,” Wang Xiong said in a deep voice.

“Yes, there is a mystery hidden in this lake. The Saint Confucian Sect intends to establish a second sect here,” the person next to him said.

Wang Xiong and the others didn’t say anything more. They immediately jumped into the lake.

Below them, Qin Yu was sitting at the gap while absorbing the spiritual energy released from the gap.

At this moment, he suddenly felt waves of fluctuations, as if someone was approaching him.

“Who is it?” Qin Yu opened his eyes slightly and looked up.

He saw four figures speeding toward him.

Qin Yu slowly stood up and looked at these people quietly. He frowned and asked, “Who are you guys?”

Wang Xiong was even more stunned. He immediately berated, “Who are you? Who told you to be here?!”

“There’s no need to talk nonsense with him. He discovered the secret in the lake. Just silence him,” the person beside him said in a deep voice. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Wang Xiong nodded and immediately strode towards Qin Yu.
