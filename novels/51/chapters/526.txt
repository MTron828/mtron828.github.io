“Clang!” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The four Martial Marquis Weapons all fell to the ground.

Qin Yu raised his foot and crushed the four Martial Marquis Weapons into pieces.

Everyone’s expressions were unsightly, and they were extremely shocked!

They had always heard of Qin Yu, but they had never personally seen him make a move.

Upon seeing him in action today, they turned pale with fright!

“Oh no, run quickly!”

They turned around to run!

Qin Yu sneered. He raised his palm and pinched forward.

The four people instantly felt a huge force grab their bodies, and they couldn’t move!

“It’s too late to run now,” Qin Yu said coldly.

In the next second, Qin Yu took a step forward and arrived in front of them in the blink of an eye.

The Heaven Swallowing Technique was activated in an instant and he devoured the four people along with their divine senses!

Elder Lu and the others who weren’t far away gulped, as if they didn’t dare to believe the scene in front of them.

“So powerful... he lives up?to his reputation!” Elder Lu couldn’t help but sigh.

After dealing with these people, Qin Yu turned around and walked in front of Elder Lu.

He cupped his hands and said, “Elder Lu, I urgently need dark energy now. If you are willing to lend me this dark energy formula, I will definitely repay you tenfold in the future.”

Elder Lu didn’t say anything. He took the dark energy formula and handed it to Qin Yu with both hands.

“Mr. Qin, I’ve heard so much about you. You are the role model of this generation. Please take this dark energy formula and use it,” Elder Lu said politely.

Many people had already regarded Qin Yu as their idol.

Qin Yu knew very well that as long as he defeated Han Wei this time, his reputation would be greatly boosted.

At that time, establishing his own sect and aristocratic family wouldn’t be a problem at all.

“Elder Lu, I will return it to you,” Qin Yu said politely.

The dark energy formula was only a one-time use item. Once it was used up, it would be gone.

However, who knew how many places in the world that were filled with dark energy had yet to be excavated. There would definitely be a chance to return it in the future.

After obtaining the dark energy formula, Qin Yu didn’t stay any longer and immediately left this place.

After going downstairs, the man with the mustache muttered, “Alright, my promise has been fulfilled. I have to make the next trip as soon as possible.”

Qin Yu looked at the man with the mustache and said, “If there’s a chance, I’ll go with you.”

“Sure, no one is unwilling to have a martial artist come along,” the man with the mustache said with a smile.

After the two of them parted ways, Qin Yu didn’t waste any time and immediately rushed to Chuzhou.

Time was of the essence and Qin Yu didn’t dare to waste a single second.

While sitting on the plane, Qin Yu began to absorb the dark energy formula.

This dark energy formula was formed from pure dark energy. The intensity of the dark energy was self-evident.

Along the way, Qin Yu spent almost all his time absorbing this dark energy formula.

When he arrived at Chuzhou, the black luster on the dark energy formula had already dimmed a little.

After returning home, Qin Yu looked at Yao Qing and Taozi.

“I’ll be going into closed-door cultivation for the next few days,” Qin Yu said.

He calculated the time and said, “On September 8th, wake me up no matter what.”

Yao Qing nodded and said, “Mr. Qin, don’t worry.”

Then, Qin Yu took the dark energy formula all the way to the back mountain.

It was already August 29th, and there were only a few days left until September 9th.

Han Wei and Yan Ruoxue’s wedding was even more widely publicized, and it almost reached everyone’s ears.

Even the news and television were reporting on this matter!

This was a marriage alliance between two top aristocratic families. Whether it was the martial arts world or ordinary people, everyone was paying attention to this matter.

With the powerful connections of the Yan family and Han family, they could practically invite all the bigwigs in Jingdu to attend the wedding!

The two parties had even arranged the wedding venue early for the arrival of the 9th of September.

Time flew by.

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

In these three days, the dark energy formula in Qin Yu’s hand had dimmed a bit more.

The dark energy within it had been reduced by more than half!

His entire body was filled with endless dark energy and spiritual energy that were slowly reaching a balance.

As the 9th of September approached, things seemed to calm down.

But everyone knew that this was the calm before the storm.

On the Martial Arts Forum, news of Han Wei kept appearing, but more people were discussing whether Qin Yu would appear at the wedding and whether the battle between the two of them could go on as planned.

“Han Wei has already killed a Martial Marquis. He must have also stepped into the Martial Marquis Realm.”

“Qin Yu is only a half-step Martial Marquis. I’m afraid his chances of winning aren’t high.”

“Qin Yu’s talent should be above Han Wei’s. You must know that Qin Yu only used a year to develop to this state from scratch!”

“Who in the world can step into the realm of half-step Martial Marquis in a year? Even Ye Qing and Jiang He couldn’t do it, right?”

“If I were Qin Yu, I would wait until I stepped into the realm of Martial Marquis to take revenge.”

“But unfortunately, Qin Yu isn’t that kind of person.”

Everyone agreed that Qin Yu would definitely appear at the wedding!

In Jingdu, the Han family’s home.

The people of the Han family, as well as the four brothers of the Yan family, were sitting in the hotel while discussing the wedding plan.

“Uncle Yan, let me propose a toast to you.” Han Wei held a glass of wine and walked in front of Yan Sihai.

“Thank you for marrying Miss Yan to me.”

This made Yan Yongxiu feel awkward. As Yan Ruoxue’s father, he wasn’t the first person to be toasted.

“Second uncle, let me propose a toast to you too.” Then, Han Wei held his glass and looked at Yan Yongxiu.

Yan Yongxiu took a sip of wine and said, “I only have one daughter. You have to treat her well.”

Han Wei laughed and said, “Don’t worry, I will definitely treat her well!”

Although he said that, Han Wei had an extremely vicious thought.

“Treat her well? Doesn’t this b*tch like Qin Yu? I will definitely torture this b*tch!” Han Wei cursed inside.

At this moment, Yan Sihai glanced at Han Wei and said, “Han Wei, are you confident in fighting with Qin Yu?”

Han Wei smiled aloofly and said, “Uncle Yan, don’t worry. He, Qin Yu, is just an ant. I can stomp him to death with just a lift of my foot!”

Han Meng, who was at the side, also laughed out loud and said, “With my son’s current ability, killing Qin Yu is no problem at all!”
