Chapter 1294: Chapter 1,294, the Heavenly Demon Ape 

Qin Yu knew that he had nowhere to hide as he watched Ling Yun approach step by step.

However, Qin Yu’s physical condition had not recovered at all.

Coupled with the speed of the flying spider, Qin Yu’s strength had dropped drastically.

I have to find a chance to escape, Qin Yu thought to himself.

He looked coldly at Ling Yun, who was approaching step by step, and adjusted his internal Qi to the maximum.

“Your ability to act as a guardian shows that you have some ability. However, in front of me, your ability is insignificant,”Ling Yun said calmly.

He raised his palm and pressed it lightly on Qin Yu.

In an instant, his internal Qi gushed out, and the entire space collapsed!

A huge force suddenly slammed into Qin Yu’s chest.

“Dang!”

A Loud Sound Shook Qin Yu back dozens of steps!

“What a heavy palm.”Qin Yu frowned.

He looked at his wound, which had not healed, and his expression became even uglier.

“HMM? Not bad, you can actually withstand my palm,”Ling Yun said calmly.

Qin Yu looked at Ling Yun coldly and said, “I heard that you are known as the number one genius of South Province. Although I don’t know if it’s true or not, I would like to experience it.”

“You? Are you qualified to challenge me?”Ling Yun couldn’t help but sneer.

He raised his palm once again as if he was going to do the same thing again.

Whoosh

However, Qin Yu didn’t choose to sit and wait for his death. He instantly appeared in front of Ling Yun and threw a heavy punch towards Ling Yun’s face!

Ling Yun didn’t Expect Qin Yu to suddenly retaliate. His pupils constricted and a light instantly appeared on his forehead.

Rays of light enveloped Ling Yun’s face and almost instantaneously shot out!

“Clang!”

His fist landed squarely on the light. With a crisp sound, the condensed light was shattered!

Even though more than half of the force had been dissipated, Qin Yu’s fist still landed heavily on Ling Yun’s face!

Ling Yun was instantly sent flying by the force. He slid on the ground for a few meters before stabilizing his body.

“Young Master!”The mighty realm beside Ling Yun immediately stepped forward.

“Stop!”

However, Ling Yun shouted loudly and stopped the attendant.

He stood up from the ground and touched the wound at the corner of his mouth. He spat out a mouthful of blood-stained teeth.

“You actually managed to injure me...”a perverted smile appeared on Ling Yun’s face.

“You Damned fellow...”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and sneered. “Why do you talk so much nonsense? Are you a middle-aged teenager?”

Ling Yun didn’t say anything more. He raised his palm as if he was gathering some terrifying power!

“Alright, I’ll let you experience the power of destruction...”Ling Yun muttered softly as his body floated into the air.

Rays of light rapidly gathered on his palm, and large areas of the surrounding space collapsed.

Just the pressure of this technique was enough to make people feel breathless.

“Heaven flipping seal!”

Ling Yun let out a loud roar, and a huge hand seal instantly formed. With a rolling momentum, it crushed down!

The entire ground collapsed, and everything within a few hundred meters was crushed into pieces!

Qin Yu’s face turned solemn. There was nowhere to hide from this palm strike. He could only clench his fist and receive it!

“Boom!”

However, this heaven-flipping seal was a top-notch divine rank technique! Even with Qin Yu’s unparalleled physical body, he was unable to resist it!

“Bang!”

Under this palm strike, Qin Yu was ruthlessly slammed onto the ground, causing the entire ground to collapse!

However, what shocked Ling Yun was that even though Qin Yu was pressed onto the ground and blood dripped out from his mouth, his physical body was still intact!

“How can he be so perverted?”Ling Yun couldn’t help but be shocked!

He had seen so for myself countless top-notch martial artist, but he had never seen such a body before!

Qin Yu got up from the ground and wiped the blood off the corner of his mouth. His expression was somewhat unsightly.

Even though this palm strike didn’t shatter his body, the powerful pressure still made his internal organs extremely uncomfortable.

“As expected of a genius from the Tianyun sect...”Qin Yu said coldly.

Ling Yun placed his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Do you know Fear Now?”

However, Qin Yu changed the topic and said with a hint of sarcasm, “I admit that you have some ability, but if my spiritual energy recovers, I’m afraid that I can suppress you with just a raise of my hand.”

His words were true. Qin Yu was already severely injured and had just experienced the battle with the flying spider. Even the poison in his body hadn’t completely disappeared.

More importantly, Qin Yu was currently unable to use the battle word formula, so he was at a disadvantage.

If his spiritual energy recovers, this so-called number one genius of the southern region wouldn’t be worth mentioning.

“You’re spouting nonsense. Do you think I don’t know that? You’re just a trash who can’t cultivate,”Ling Yun said coldly.

Qin Yu mocked, “That’s just the ignorance of Your Heavenly Cloud sect. I can tell you clearly that your heavenly cloud sect will definitely regret it.”

“Make my Heavenly Cloud sect regret it? Do you have the ability to do that!”Ling Yun roared. His terrifying voice was like a huge wave that sent Qin Yu flying back!

The wounds on his body were once again opened up and fresh blood flowed out.

“Cough cough...”

Qin Yu coughed violently and blood flowed out of his mouth uncontrollably.

“No... my current condition is too bad.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but grit his teeth.

If he wasn’t heavily injured, Qin Yu wouldn’t have been in a weak state even without the support of his spiritual energy.

“Alright, Qin Yu, it’s time to end you,”Ling Yun said calmly.

He opened his hands and a huge disk suddenly appeared behind him! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

This disk appeared behind him like a strange phenomenon. It was extremely domineering.

The aura emitted from the disk was extremely terrifying and oppressive. Even Qin Yu felt a strong sense of danger.

He didn’t know what kind of spell it was, but it was definitely not ordinary.

However, at this moment, a smile appeared on Qin Yu’s lips.

“Smile? You still have the mood to Smile?”Ling Yun raised his eyebrows.

“You’re about to die, do you know that?”

Qin Yu sneered. “I don’t think so.”

“Oh?”Ling Yun was slightly surprised.

“Why? Do you have any other trump cards? I’d like to see so for myself,”Ling Yun said calmly.

Qin Yu shook his head. “I have nothing else other than my fist.”

“Hehe, looks like you’ve been scared silly,”Ling Yun couldn’t help but laugh coldly.

Qin Yu shook his head again. “Ling Yun, I’m afraid you’ve forgotten where we are. This is green rock forest! We’re already near the border.”

“HMM? So?”Ling Yun frowned slightly. At this moment, he suddenly understood something!

Before he could regain his senses, a huge palm whizzed over and tore the disk hanging from his back into pieces!
