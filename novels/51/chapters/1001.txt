Chapter 1002: Chapter 1002, refining the recovery spirit pill

The middle-aged man was silent for a moment.

Then, he sighed and said, “It’s not that we don’t want to, it’s that the princess won’t let us.”

“Ruoxue won’t let us?”Qin Yu was slightly stunned, but he quickly understood.

He smiled at the middle-aged man and nodded. “Okay, I got it.”

The problem in Qin Yu’s heart was finally solved.

And Qin Yu finally got three stalks of heavenly vanilla as he wished.

“Do you know how to use this heavenly vanilla?”At this moment, the middle-aged man suddenly asked.

Qin Yu scratched his head and said, “I really forgot about this. It seems that I have to refine some pill.”

Back then, pavilion master did tell Qin Yu, but it was just a casual mention.

After such a long time, Qin Yu only remembered to get the heavenly vanilla grass, but forgot what pill to refine.

The middle-aged man took out a prescription and handed it to Qin Yu.

“Fortunately, I brought the prescription,”he said somewhat helplessly.

Qin Yu took the prescription and quickly cupped his hands, saying, “Thank you, senior.”

“Don’t thank me. If you want to thank, thank the princess,”the middle-aged man said.

“She believes that it won’t be long before you become an invincible existence in this world.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “Senior, please pass on a message for me and the princess. Just say... that I will definitely keep the promise I made back then.”

“It won’t be long before I meet her.”

“Okay, I will definitely bring her,”the middle-aged man said with a smile.

He slowly stood up and looked into the distance. “It shouldn’t be peaceful here, right?”

“How did you know?”This surprised Qin Yu.

“I guessed.”He waved his hand.

“I’ve brought the things, I should go.”

Qin Yu said politely, “How about... staying for a meal?”

“Forget it.”The middle-aged man smiled.

Then, his body shook slightly, and in the blink of an eye, he disappeared without a trace.

After he left, Qin Yu impatiently took out the sandalwood box and took out the letter that Yan Ruoxue had brought.

There was a faint fragrance on the letter.

And at the bottom right corner of the letter, there was a red lip.

This red lip was obviously left by Yan Ruoxue. Qin Yu looked at that red lip and couldn’t help but laugh foolishly.

After opening the letter, the first thing that came into his sight was a piece of black hair.

His hair was about ten centimeters long. When he saw this hair, Qin Yu could not help but think of Yan Ruoxue’s face.

He even started to fantasize about the future of the two of them.

“Phew...”

Qin Yu shook his head forcefully and pulled himself back to reality.

He carefully tucked his hair away and opened the letter. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Lines of delicate and pretty words were left behind in the letter.

“Qin Yu, long time no see. I believe you are now trapped in the half-step martial Saint Realm.”

“Those three heavenly herbs should be able to help you tide over the crisis temporarily.”

“HMM... let me guess, what are you doing now? It has been so long. I believe the Martial Arts Association of Jingdu is sending people to hunt you down, right?”

“Alright, I believe you will definitely tide over this crisis. I will wait for you in the Yan family’s secret realm. I hope to see you sooner.”

“If... One day you don’t want to live like this anymore, you can crush the token. I will bring you to the Yan family’s secret realm to stay away from the noise.”

“As long as you are willing, I can help you get rid of all your enemies. Of course, with your character, you should not be willing to do this.”

Looking at the words on it, Qin Yu felt waves of warmth in his heart.

Of course, he understood what Yan Ruoxue meant.

However, Qin Yu was no longer the young man who begged for protection.

“I won’t give up.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

He carefully put away the token and put it into his spatial divine weapon.

“With this heavenly vanilla, I can enter the martial saint realm as soon as possible.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

After enduring for so long, he could finally restore his golden core.

He turned around and returned to his room. Then, he carefully took out this pill formula.

This pill was called the Spirit Recovery Pill. In addition to a stalk of heavenly herb, it also required some ordinary medicinal herbs.

Other than that, there was an extremely high requirement to refine the spirit recovery pill.

It required three alchemists with purple flames to refine it together.

“Three purple flames?”

Seeing this condition, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

Other than himself, the only person Qin Yu knew who had purple flames was the pavilion master.

“Three purple flames. I’m afraid it’s not easy to find them.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

There were very few people in the world who had spiritual fire to begin with, and those who had purple flames were even rarer!

“I didn’t expect that apart from being harsh on herbs, the recovery spirit pill also has such perverse conditions for alchemists,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Most importantly, Qin Yu simply couldn’t afford to waste time.

Three days later, Hua Zongxiong would definitely bring people to seize the Heaven Gate.

“This time is completely insufficient.”Qin Yu took a deep breath, momentarily at a loss.

Qin Yu paced around the room for a long time before he finally decided to temporarily give up on the Heaven Gate!

“At most, I will give the Heaven Gate to him first. When I step into the martial saint realm, I will snatch it back!”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu decided to temporarily leave the Sheng Kingdom.

“Pavilion Master is the best in the industry. She might have a way.”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Hence, Qin Yu planned to return to the fire country for the time being to ask for the pavilion master’s help in finding the next alchemist who possessed the Purple Pyro.

After that, Qin Yu hardened his heart and left the Heaven Gate that night.

All the way to the airport, Qin Yu bought the earliest flight back to the fire country.

In the evening of the next day, Qin Yu successfully arrived at the fire country’s pyro.

After a few twists and turns, Qin Yu finally arrived at the entrance of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion at around eight o’clock in the evening.

Qin Yu could not wait to restore his golden core, so he did not think about anything and Strode into the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.
