Chapter 1242: Chapter 1,242, Jiang Yi challenged 

On the martial arts forum, Jiang Yi’s challenge letter had long been placed at the top of the list.

Jiang Yi was very eager to prove himself.

He didn’t want to be famous, but he wanted to tell the world that he was no worse than Qin Yu!

Soon, all of Jiang Yi’s information was exposed.

Including how he was Jiang he’s disciple and how he left Jiang He, it was made public.

“Rumor has it that Jiang Yi left Jiang he because he was jealous.”

“That’s right. Jiang he had praised Qin Yu many times. This caused Jiang Yi to be dissatisfied and left Jiang he in a fit of anger.”

“TSK tsk, even though that’s the case, Jiang Yi’s abilities are not bad. Now that he has stepped into the half-step mighty realm, he should be considered the best in this world, right?”

“Half-step mighty realm? So terrifying? That Qin Yu seems to be only at the middle stage of the Martial Saint Realm, right?”

For a moment, everyone was discussing animatedly. On this night, Jiang Yi sent another message.

“Qin Yu, the challenge has already been issued for three days. Why haven’t you responded? Are You Afraid?”Jiang Yi’s words were directed directly at Qin Yu.

“As long as you admit that you’re afraid, this battle can be canceled.”

Qin Yu looked at the message sent by Jiang Yi and couldn’t help but smile bitterly.

The current Qin Yu was already the number one person in the world. There would probably be countless successors who wanted to challenge him.

It wasn’t until 10 o’clock at night that Qin Yu’s reply came.

“If you want to fight, then fight.”

The words were extremely short, but it once again brought the atmosphere to a climax!

That night, the martial arts forum was extremely lively, but Qin Yu no longer had the mood to watch it.

He didn’t sleep the entire night, quietly waiting for Jiang Yi’s arrival.

This person was early in the morning, and the sun slowly rose from the east.

Qin Yu stood near the Heaven Gate, waiting for Jiang Yi’s arrival.

And in the dark, there were already many people hiding, quietly watching the battle.

Almost everyone was more optimistic about Qin Yu. There was only one reason, and that was that up until now, Qin Yu had not suffered a single defeat!

He had created a miracle under the condition of being looked down upon countless times. Therefore, no one doubted Qin Yu’s ability anymore, even if he was facing a newly advanced half-step into the mighty realm!

Time passed by minute by minute. At nine o’clock in the morning, a young man slowly walked over from not far away.

He carried a saber on his back, and his thin face was filled with coldness and determination.

“He’s here,”someone said in a low voice.

“Is He Jiang Yi? He does look extraordinary.”

“His every move seems to be compatible with the Great Dao. This is a sign that he has stepped into the Almighty Realm.”

Qin Yu looked at Jiang Yi who was slowly walking toward him. His face was neither happy nor sad.

Jiang Yi’s footsteps were extremely fast. In a few flashes, he arrived in front of Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, long time no see,”Jiang Yi said coldly.

Qin Yu said slowly, “Jiang Yi, you and I shouldn’t have fought.”

“Cut the crap,”Jiang Yi interrupted Qin Yu.

He said coldly, “If you’re afraid, you can say it.”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “There’s no hatred between us, and I won’t have any feelings for you.”

“Hahahaha!”

Upon hearing this, Jiang Yi could not help but burst into laughter.

“From your words, it seems that it is very easy to kill me?”Jiang Yi shouted. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Qin Yu, don’t think too highly of yourself! Jiang he has poor taste, that’s why he passed the nine secrets to you!”

“Now that I don’t have the nine secrets, I will not be weak to you either! I have already created a set of spells that are no weaker than the nine secrets!”

“I’ll tell Jiang he how bad his taste is!”

Qin Yu fell into silence and didn’t speak for a long time.

“Why aren’t you speaking? !”Jiang Yi said angrily.

Qin Yu sighed and said, “Senior Jiang he has already stepped into the saint-level. No matter what you do, he won’t know.”

Jiang Yi was stunned and immediately said angrily, “Then I’ll kill you and bring your corpse to the saint-level to see him!”

“Why are you so stubborn? In senior Jiang He’s eyes, you are equally outstanding, and...”

“Cut the crap!”Jiang Yi roared and interrupted Qin Yu’s words.

He said coldly, “Today, I have defeated you, and that will prove everything. Come!”

After saying that, Jiang Yi’s internal Qi began to surge crazily. The precious light on his body was slowly circulating, and the entire ground collapsed in an instant!

Everyone could feel the terrifying pressure on his body. Countless people were suffocated by the pressure!

“What a terrifying internal Qi. Is this a half-step mighty figure? !”

“As expected, the half-step mighty realm in this world is many times stronger than that reclusive mighty figure!”

“These are two completely different realms. I’m Afraid Qin Yu is in danger!”

Jiang Yi’s internal Qi was still climbing, and cracks appeared on the ground.

The trees around him rustled, as if a storm was about to fall.

“Ah! ! !”

At this moment, Jiang he raised his head and roared, and the dark clouds above his head completely disappeared.

His internal Qi had also reached its peak!

His entire body was enshrouded in precious splendor, and it was extremely terrifying.

Jiang Yi looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Do you see that? This is the current me.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “I can’t sense any internal Qi from your body at all.”

Ever since his spiritual power disappeared, it was very difficult for Qin Yu to sense a person’s strength or weakness.

However, these words sounded rather mocking in Jiang Yi’s ears.

“You Arrogant Bastard!”Jiang Yi flew into a rage. He stared at Qin Yu and said, “Let’s see if you will still be so arrogant after I break your body and shatter your primordial spirit!”
