Chapter 1316: Chapter 1,316. There was only one room left 

When the woman heard Qin Yu’s words, her pale face under the veil also changed slightly.

“Who exactly are you? !”Ah San took a step forward. He held the long sword in his hand and pointed it at Qin Yu.

“Ah San, don’t Be Rude!”The woman scolded again.

Qin Yu put down the chopsticks in his hand and said with a smile, “It seems that I guessed correctly.”

The woman hesitated for a moment, then nodded and said, “That’s right. I am indeed for the vitality of life. How did you know?” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Qin Yu said with a faint smile, “Because I am also for the vitality of life. I want to rush to Yang City. Speaking of which, we might be enemies.”

“In that case, I will kill you first!”That Ah San said coldly.

Qin Yu looked at him coldly and said, “Noisy thing. If you dare to talk nonsense again, don’t blame me for not being polite.”

“Hehe, just based on you? You’re boasting shamelessly!”Ah San said coldly.

“AH SAN, from now on, you’re not allowed to speak without permission!”The woman frowned and said.

Although AH San was unwilling, he still obediently retreated to the side.

The woman ate while sighing and said, “I don’t know why you need life qi, but this life qi... is very important to me.”

Qin Yu had nothing to hide, so he told the woman about his situation.

After the woman heard it, she couldn’t help but turn pale with fright.

There was no other reason except that this woman was also poisoned by the Twilight Qi!

The only difference was that she wasn’t as lucky as Qin Yu, and she didn’t have a tough body like Qin Yu’s.

After a conversation, she learned that this woman was called Wan ‘er, and she was the descendant of a big family in the South Province.

As for which family it was, wan ‘Er didn’t tell Qin Yu, and Qin Yu wasn’t interested in knowing.

“No wonder fellow Daoist’s appetite is so big,”wan ‘er said jokingly.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “That has nothing to do with the Twilight Qi. I’m quite a glutton, and I’m a pig.”

Wan ‘er couldn’t help but cover her mouth and laugh, saying, “Fellow Daoist, you’re so humorous.”

Ah San, who was at the side, snorted coldly. He didn’t quite understand Wan ‘er’s behavior.

The more they talked, the happier they became. Perhaps it was because they had the same illness that caused their conversation to be extremely happy and smooth.

“Young Master Qin, since you’re also going to Yang City, why don’t We Travel Together Tomorrow? We can take care of each other on the way,”Wan ‘er suggested.

Qin Yu raised his brows and said, “Travel together? Aren’t you afraid that I’ll Steal Your Life Force?”

Wan ‘er smiled and said, “The life force will eventually fall into the hands of anyone. It all depends on one’s own abilities. Furthermore, I don’t think they will hand over their life force to us so easily. We should be considered allies.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Forget about being fellow travelers. I don’t want to cause trouble for you guys.”

The reason why Qin Yu said that was because he knew that Ling Yun would come at any moment. With Ling Yun’s brutal character, he wouldn’t let go of anyone around Qin Yu.

However, these words sounded different to AH SAN.

From his point of view, Qin Yu was obviously afraid that he would kill him on the way.

“Alright, since Young Master Qin doesn’t want to go with me, then forget it.”Wan ‘Er didn’t insist too much.

After this meal, Wan ‘er went to the front desk to settle the bill. At the same time, she planned to get a room to sleep in.

Fortunately, wan ‘er came too late and the room was already gone.

The last room was booked by Qin Yu.

“This young master’s room is a big room. You can squeeze in,”said the front desk.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He didn’t want to stay in the same room with others.

“It’s not convenient. Let’s forget it.”Qin Yu glanced at Wan ‘er.

Wan ‘ER’s eyes flashed with a hint of a request.

“Forget it, forget it. If you don’t mind, let’s share the same room.”Qin Yu waved his hand.

Wan ‘er was delighted and quickly said, “Thank you, Young Master Qin.”

Helpless, Qin Yu could only bring Wan ‘er and that annoying third to the room.

As expected, this was really a large room.

There was a big bed in the room, which could accommodate five people. It was quite spacious.

“Miss, don’t worry. I will keep an eye on this kid tonight. I guarantee that he won’t have the chance to do anything obscene to you,”AH San said coldly.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “If I really want to do something to her, do you think you can stop me?”

“You can try!”Ah San said with a cold face.

“AH SAN!”Wan ‘er frowned and berated, “Young Master Qin is not that kind of person.”

“Humph, you must be wary of others. Anyway, I Won’t Sleep Tonight.”Ah San snorted.

Seeing Ah San’s behavior, Qin Yu’s eyes rolled and suddenly wanted to tease him.

Therefore, Qin Yu sat on the bed and pointed at AH SAN, “You, get out.”

Ah San’s face turned cold, and he scolded, “What did you say?”

“I said get out. This is my room! I allowed Miss Wan ‘Er to come in. Since when did I allow you to come in?”Qin Yu said with a smile.

Ah San’s face turned even colder. He narrowed his eyes and said, “Kid, if you dare to have designs on our miss, I Won’t Let You Go!”

Qin Yu sneered, “Cut the crap. Either you get out of here, or you bring your miss to another shop. But... I guess your miss is already tired after traveling for another day with the twilight poison, right?”

Wan ‘er frowned slightly. After thinking for a moment, she said, “Ah San, go wait outside.”
