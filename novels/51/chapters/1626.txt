Chapter 1627: Chapter 1,627, calling out to the entire southern region! 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

According to Di Zun’s analysis, the sect master only felt that it wasn’t worth it for him to make a move, which was why he hadn’t returned yet.

Now that the Master of the Northern Region had entered the realm, wasn’t that an opportunity?

“Master of the Northern Region... you’ve really helped us.”The deputy sect master took a deep breath, his eyes filled with strong anticipation.

The next day.

This news spread throughout the entire southern region.

The entire southern region was in a state of panic.

Although there was a dead river between the southern region and the northern region, everyone knew what the Lord of the northern lands meant.

He was a top-notch martial artist who had existed for an extremely long time. No one knew just how powerful he was!

The four great godly monarchs had already caused the southern region to be in a state of panic. who could resist the current lord of the Northern Region?

For a moment, the various large sects in the southern region trembled.

Wind Bamboo Mountain.

During this period of time, qu Zhu had almost fully recovered.

In addition to the ammunition that Qin Yu had refined for him, the current him might not have recovered to his peak condition, but he was almost there.

At the entrance of wind bamboo mountain.

A white-clothed youth who looked to be in his teens stood there, staring coldly at something.

He looked at the formation that Qu Zhu had set up. Then, he gently waved his hand and a terrifying surge of internal Qi instantly surged over!

In just an instant, the formation collapsed!

The fog that lingered at the entrance of wind bamboo mountain disappeared without a trace!

Qu Zhu, who was on wind bamboo mountain, also sensed this terrifying aura. He frowned slightly and immediately walked over.

When their eyes met, Qu Zhu had a bad feeling in his heart.

“You Are Qu Zhu?”The elementalist was the first to speak.

Qu Zhu sized him up and said, “I am. Who Are You?”

The elementalist ignored qu Zhu and walked straight up the wind bamboo mountain.

Qu Zhu’s brows were tightly knitted, but he did not change his expression as he followed behind him.

As the elementalist walked on the mountain path of the wind bamboo mountain, he sighed and said, “This kind of environment is really something that the northern lands does not have.”

“You are indeed from the northern lands!”Qu Zhu’s expression changed slightly, and his internal Qi was instantly raised to the maximum.

The elementalist turned around and said with his hands behind his back, “I’m here to look for the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect. Unfortunately, he doesn’t dare to meet me. In that case, I’ll come and meet your so-called three madmen and three deadly ones.”

“There’s no need to talk nonsense. Let’s do it,”qu Zhu said coldly.

The wind bamboo mountain shook the sky and the earth as pieces of rubble fell down.

This originally beautiful scenery quickly turned into ruins.

Ten minutes later.

The elementalist walked down from the ruins.

He still looked spotless and the coldness on his face did not diminish. Meanwhile, qu Zhu had long since stopped moving.

Seven Water River.

A monk was sitting by the river with his eyes slightly closed.

A young man appeared behind him.

The monk sensed his arrival, but he did not turn around. Instead, he raised his head and sighed.

“He came faster than I expected,”the monk said in a low voice.

The elementalist said coldly, “I’m very disappointed by the three lunatics and three absolutes of your southern region.”

The Great War broke out, and the river water was instantly evaporated.

In just a few minutes, the monk of the Great Dawn fell to the ground and was unable to get up.

The elementalist snorted coldly and said, “What three madmen and three deadly strikes? That’s all there is to it.”

In the next few days.

All the major sects and sects in the southern region were affected.

And the terrifying strength of the elementalist caused an extremely strong sense of despair.

No one was able to fight against an elementalist.

His every move contained extremely terrifying true energy.

In a short seven days.

The southern region had almost fallen. It was a tragic sight.

“Hmph, I’ve seen all the top-notch martial artist in the southern region. They’re all a bunch of trash!”The elementalist’s voice spread across more than half of the southern region.

“Next, I’ll wait for the sect leader of the Heavenly Cloud sect at the northern border. If he doesn’t come, don’t blame me for being impolite!”

This voice was like Rolling Thunder. He did not know what kind of technique he had used, but it was actually close to a person’s divine sense.

“The master of the northern lands... has finally arrived...”

“The three maniacs and three deadly ones have all been killed. All the major sects are no exception. Other than the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, who else can resist!”

“This master of the northern lands... is too arrogant!”

The Master of the Northern Lands’voice reverberated in everyone’s ears.

They felt humiliated and helpless at the same time.

This was because the master of the northern lands was too powerful. This kind of power could not be won by numbers!

“The southern province is vast and abundant. I don’t believe that no one is his match!”

“A master of the northern lands is enough to make us fall...”

“Why hasn’t the sect Master of the Heavenly Cloud sect appeared yet!”

Everyone in the southern province was waiting for the appearance of the Master of the Heavenly Cloud sect. However, three days had passed in the blink of an eye.

Three days had passed, but there was no news of the Master of the Heavenly Cloud sect. It was as if he had disappeared from the world.

At the northern border, by the Dead River.

The young master of the northern lands slowly rose into the sky.

A strange black energy was emitted from his body. This internal Qi suddenly exploded and covered the sky like dark clouds!

“It seems that the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect is just an empty title.”The voice of the Master of the northern land sounded as if it came from the sky. It was extremely ear-piercing!

“Are you useless people worthy of owning the Southern Region?”

“Since the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect doesn’t appear, then from today onwards, the Southern Region will be a subordinate of the northern land!”

With that, the master of the northern land waved his hand and the void in front of him began to tremble! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Countless pitch-black wormholes suddenly appeared. Then, one after another, black-robed men emerged from the wormholes!

The ones leading the way were the four great godly monarchs of the northern lands!

And behind them were countless black-robed men!

In just a short moment, the northern border was already filled with people!

The elementalist looked down coldly. Then, with a wave of his hand, an image of the northern border was projected in space!

“Quick... quick, look, what’s that in the sky!”

“This scene... seems to be the northern border! Why would the northern border suddenly appear in the sky!”

“It’s the northern Lord’s Trick! What kind of trick is this?”

“So... so many people...”

At this moment, almost the entire southern region raised their heads to look at the sky.

The image projected from the sky made everyone feel despair.

The army was like a dark cloud pressing down on the land. It was obvious that the northern lands were planning to launch an all-out attack.

At that time, everyone in the entire South Province would probably die!

In the Zhuo family, many young people raised their heads to look at this scene and could not help but have a solemn expression on their faces.

In the Green Rock Forest, all the hunters had stopped hunting. Their hands that were holding onto their weapons seemed to be trembling.

The city Lord of Gu City had his hands behind his back as he muttered, “The calamity of the southern region has arrived...”

At the same time, in an unknown village in the southern region, a tall and slender man dressed in white was farming.

At this moment, he raised his head to look at the scene in the sky.

Looking at the youth in the scene, his eyes revealed a trace of surprise as he muttered, “The lord of the Northern Region...”
