Feeling Yan Ruoxue’s anger, Yuan Hong felt more and more uneasy.

“Who... who are you? It’s none of your business!” Yuan Hong braced himself and said.

As soon as he finished speaking, Yan Jiang, who wasn’t far away, suddenly pulled the whip!

In an instant, Yuan Hong arrived in front of Yan Jiang!

Then, Yan Jiang grabbed Yuan Hong’s neck and said coldly, “That’s our family’s eldest lady.”

The Yan family’s eldest lady!

Yuan Hong’s body suddenly trembled, and his body suddenly went slack!

How come the Yan family’s daughter came here?

“Miss, may I ask how to deal with him?” Yan Jiang looked at Yan Ruoxue and said.

Yan Ruoxue gritted her silver teeth and said coldly, “Tie him up. Treat him the way he treated Qin Yu!”

“Also, don’t let him die!”

Yan Jiang nodded and said, “Yes, miss.”

Yan Jiang stretched out his palm and Yuan Hong’s body was instantly nailed to the wall by a few iron rods!

In the next second, Yan Jiang waved his long whip and whipped Yuan Hong’s body!

“Ah! ! !” With just a whip, Yuan Hong raised his head and wailed in pain!

Yan Ruoxue ran in front of Qin Yu anxiously.

At this moment, Qin Yu had already fainted.

When she saw Qin Yu being tortured to such a state, Yan Ruoxue’s heart was bleeding.

She held Qin Yu’s face, and tears flowed down her cheeks.

“How could they do this to you...” Yan Ruoxue caressed Qin Yu’s face, and tears streamed down.

The Inner Strength Grandmasters beside Yan Ruoxue hurriedly moved forward. They stretched out their palms, and a ray of light cut through the chains.

“Miss, let’s send him to the hospital first,” the person beside her reminded.

Yan Ruoxue hurriedly nodded and said, “Quick, send Qin Yu to the hospital!”

The few of them quickly carried Qin Yu into the car, and the car rushed all the way to the hospital.

Inside the execution ground, the whip in Yan Jiang’s hand still didn’t stop.

As the Inner Strength Grandmaster of the Yan family, he had countless spells.

Every time Yuan Hong was about to faint, Yan Jiang would activate his spells and forcefully wake him up.

This was worse than death.

“I think this kind of torturing formation should be destroyed.” Yan Jiang scanned his surroundings.

Then, he waved his hand and a terrifying force instantly gushed out from his palm!

In the next second, a powerful force descended from the sky!

In an instant, explosive sounds immediately erupted!

Clouds of dust rose up. The formation set up by the Martial Arts Association was destroyed with a single palm strike and was turned into ruins!

Such a loud sound instantly attracted much attention.

Even people in the prison heard the sound!

“It’s in the direction of the execution ground!”

“What happened? Did Mr. Qin escape?”

Everyone tensed up. They stared in the direction of the execution ground with mixed feelings.

Yao Qing couldn’t help but clench his fists and whisper, “Mr. Qin, you must be okay...”

...

Inside the execution ground, Yuan Hong had been tortured until he barely looked human.

Why didn’t he expect that the abuser would be reduced to the abused?

“Please... spare me...” Yuan Hong said in pain.

Yan Jiang sneered. “I’m sorry. I won’t stop until Miss Yan gives the order.”

This kind of pain that was worse than death made Yuan Hong want to commit suicide!

He wanted to self-detonate, but he found that he couldn’t control his body at all!

“Without Miss Yan’s order, you don’t even have the right to die,” Yan Jiang said coldly.

...

Qin Yu was brought to the hospital.

Qin Yu was unconscious due to such a serious injury and was directly pushed into the operating theater.

Yan Ruoxue stood at the door while looking a little anxious.

“Go and get the best doctor in Jingdu for me,” Yan Ruoxue said coldly.

“Yes!”

Just as her subordinates were about to make a phone call, the doctor walked out of the operating theater.

“How is he?” Seeing the Doctor, Yan Ruoxue hurriedly walked over.

The doctor muttered, “That’s strange. The patient suffered such a serious injury. An ordinary person might not even be able to survive, but he’s actually fine...”

“Is what you said true?” Yan Ruoxue hurriedly asked.

The doctor quickly nodded and said, “It’s true. This is simply a miracle in medical history.”

With the doctor’s assurance, Yan Ruoxue was relieved.

“Can I go in and see him now?” Yan Ruoxue asked.

The doctor frowned and said, “Yes, but... you have to keep quiet.”

Yan Ruoxue quickly walked into the ward.

On the hospital bed, Qin Yu was lying there quietly without moving at all.

Looking at the side of Qin Yu’s face, Yan Ruoxue couldn’t help but feel heartache. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“How much will you have to suffer to climb up from the bottom?” Yan Ruoxue murmured.

She bent down and gently kissed Qin Yu’s forehead, then whispered, “Qin Yu, you must be well...”

At this moment, Yan Ruoxue suddenly regretted it.

If she had known that Qin Yu would suffer so much, why did she insist on making him stand out?

Wasn’t a peaceful life better?

However, there was no turning back. Qin Yu was already in the public eye. It was probably impossible for him to turn back.

“Miss, since Qin Yu is fine, it’s time for us to go back,” the person next to her reminded.

Yan Ruoxue frowned slightly, as if she was reluctant to part with him.

“Miss, Master said that before Qin Yu goes to Jingdu, you should try not to see each other,” the person next to her continued to advise.

Yan Ruoxue was extremely reluctant, but she was unable to go against her grandfather’s words.

“I understand. You can leave,” Yan Ruoxue said.

The people beside her didn’t dare to disobey Yan Ruoxue’s orders. They could only walk to the door and wait quietly.

Yan Ruoxue sat next to Qin Yu. She held Qin Yu’s hand and said with a smile, “Qin Yu, don’t you think it’s strange? We have clearly known each other for such a short time, but it seems like we’ve known each other for many years.”

“Ever since I was young, I’ve seen too many betrayals because of benefits. No matter how pure a relationship is, it won’t stand the test of personal benefits.”

“So I never thought that I would fall in love with someone else, until I met you.”

Yan Ruoxue whispered in Qin Yu’s ear, and a smile bloomed on her face.

She grabbed Qin Yu’s hand and placed it on her face.

“Qin Yu, you must be well. I will wait for you in Jingdu, no matter how long it takes.”

After saying this, Yan Ruoxue slowly stood up.

She reluctantly glanced at Qin Yu, then walked out of the door.

At this moment, a hand suddenly grabbed her wrist!

After turning around, she saw Qin Yu open his eyes.

“Don’t go...” Qin Yu squeezed out a few words with difficulty.

Yan Ruoxue was so happy that she cried. She turned around and held Qin Yu’s hand in her palm. She said in a low voice, “I won’t go. I’ll stay with you.”

When he heard this, a smile appeared on Qin Yu’s face, and then he fainted again.

He couldn’t even tell if this was reality or a dream.
