Chapter 1409: Chapter 1,409, the great battle begins! 1

Seeing Qin Yu suddenly arrive on the carriage, everyone couldn’t help but be shocked.

“First Elder, I’m here,”Qin Yu said, looking at first elder coldly.

First Elder slowly stood up. He sized up Qin Yu and said with a sneer, “It seems that you’ve obtained some treasure in the divine capital, and now you actually dare to come in front of me and make a ruckus.”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “As I said, I really want to see your strength.”

The great elder narrowed his eyes and said, “It’s not a good thing for young people to be arrogant.”

“Stop talking nonsense,”Qin Yu sneered.

“It’s not certain who will live and who will die today. If you scram now, you might be able to keep your old life.”

Qin Yu’s repeated provocations made the first elder lose his patience completely.

He narrowed his eyes and said in a low voice, “I think you... are courting death!”

Before he finished his words, the first elder suddenly stretched out his hand and grabbed at Qin Yu!

Qin Yu did not Dodge. He clenched his fist and met the first elder head-on.

“Clang!”

At the moment of collision, a terrifying force exploded!

The dragon-headed carriage beneath the first elder’s feet was instantly shattered into pieces!

Everyone hurriedly leaped up from the carriage and stood in mid-air.

Qin Yu did not have any spiritual energy, so he naturally did not have the ability to fly for a long time.

He slowly landed on the ground and raised his head to look at the first elder.

A thick black fog suddenly appeared in mid-air!

At this moment, a palm that was like dried wood suddenly stretched out. A Ray of light cut through the air and ruthlessly grabbed towards Qin Yu’s chest!

“Chi la!”

It was as if a sharp blade had cut through steel, producing an extremely ear-piercing sound!

Very quickly, the figure of the first elder appeared not far away. The owner of that Palm was also the first elder.

He looked at Qin Yu’s chest, and an extremely shocked expression appeared on his face!

He saw that there was nothing on Qin Yu’s chest except for a few white marks. Even his skin had not been cut open!

“His physical body... why did it suddenly become so hard!”The first elder was extremely shocked!

Qin Yu lowered his head and looked at his dark golden bullet. The corners of his mouth could not help but curl up into a smile. The next second, he even laughed out loud.

“Hahahahaha!”

The entire sky was filled with Qin Yu’s laughter!

“It seems like what my master said is right. It is not nonsense to say that my physical body has reached the return to void stage! The Grand First Elder of the Heavenly Cloud sect could not even cut open my skin. hahahaha! This is a joke!”Qin Yu laughed maniacally. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The veins on the grand elder’s forehead bulged. He once again realized that he had missed the best opportunity to capture Qin Yu.

However, as a top figure of the heavenly cloud sect and even the entire southern province, he naturally had full confidence.

Even though Qin Yu had become a little strange, it only shocked him.

“Come, Grand Elder, fight with me and avenge your disciple!”Qin Yu took a step forward. His hair danced wildly, and his body was full of battle intent. He was like a god of War!

The first elder was the same, and many disciples of the Heavenly Cloud sect quickly surrounded him.

Qin Yu glanced at them and sneered, “This group of trash, there’s no need to attack.”

The first elder said coldly, “Kid, don’t be too arrogant.”

With that, the first elder waved his hand, and the hundreds of people immediately attacked!

Qin Yu couldn’t stop laughing. He opened his arms, and golden light burst out from his body. He sneered, “Come on, let’s see how you can hurt me!”

The countless spells landed on Qin Yu’s body, making a sound like raindrops hitting steel.

But what was shocking was that Qin Yu was completely unharmed! Not even a white dot could be left behind!

“Comfortable, hahahaha! Are you guys tickling me? Continue!”Qin Yu roared crazily!

This was the capital of having a strong body! Even if you had great abilities, you wouldn’t be able to break through the defense!

The disciples of the Heavenly Cloud sect couldn’t help but look shocked. They looked at each other in extreme fear.

The first elder narrowed his eyes and took a deep breath. A trace of solemnity appeared on his face.

Although he didn’t want to admit it, the truth was right in front of him.

The current Qin Yu was no longer the defenseless Qin Yu from a few days ago.

“All of you can leave,”the first elder said coldly.

Hearing this, everyone hurriedly retreated.

The first elder’s body slowly floated up, and the aura on his body was rapidly rising.

“You’re forcing me to make a move,”the first elder said coldly.

Qin Yu mocked, “Don’t say such harsh words. Do you think I’m afraid of You?”

The first elder closed his eyes slightly, as if he was using some kind of spell.

The Aura on his body had reached its peak.

A powerful aura came at them, and everyone felt this extremely powerful pressure!

Even Qin Yu couldn’t help but Exclaim!

As expected of the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s first elder, his strength was indeed terrifying!

“Look at the two of us, I can’t hide my strength anymore,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

He didn’t think anymore and directly opened the fifth level of the battle word technique.

No one had expected that Qin Yu could actually force the first elder to such an extent.

And no one had expected that Qin Yu’s strength would actually have such an increase in a short period of time!
