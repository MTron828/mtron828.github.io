Looking at the gloomy Granny Qin, Qin Yu frowned.

“Old b*stard, you came quite quickly.” Qin Yu squinted his eyes and said.

Granny Qin laughed loudly and said, “Qin Yu, I have to say, you’re quite well-informed.”

Qin Yu looked at Granny Qin coldly and said, “Stop talking nonsense, you old b*stard. If you have something to say, say it quickly.”

Granny Qin narrowed her eyes and sneered. “Qin Yu, the heavenly guardian book can let you live for another month, but it doesn’t mean that it can guarantee your safety.”

“It’s true that I can’t kill you now, but I can still make your life worse than death.”

As she spoke, the three purple-robed men took a step forward in unison.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “It seems that you don’t have confidence in that b*stard you raised. Are you afraid that he won’t be a match for me in a month?”

Granny Qin narrowed her eyes and said coldly, “Blackie will kill you like slaughtering chickens and dogs! But even so, I won’t let you spend this month comfortably!”

As her voice fell, a purple-robed man suddenly made a move and grabbed at Qin Yu!

Qin Yu snorted coldly and immediately clenched his fist to meet it.

“Boom!”

A loud sound reverberated throughout the entire club, and a terrifying force spread out in all directions!

“Bang!”

Under this punch, the purple-robed man took a few steps back! His fist felt painful!

“What a tough body.” The purple-robed man couldn’t help but frown.

Qin Yu slowly stood up.

He glanced at the few purple-robed men in front of him and said coldly, “Not long ago, I killed three of your people and swallowed their golden cores. Just the few of you are no match for me.”

“Hahaha!” Granny Qin couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

A terrifying killing intent burst out from her body, and an eerie internal qi gathered on her body!

“Qin Yu, you talk big!” Granny Qin said coldly.

Sensing Granny Qin’s internal qi, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

Granny Qin was at the peak of the Martial Marquis realm, and her strength wasn’t ordinary. She was far above the purple-robed men.

If they really fought, he would most likely die.

“Enough!”

At this moment, Tang Mo suddenly stood up.

He stared at them and said, “You will pay for the damage. Also, who let you in? Security, security!”

The manager of the club was scared out of his wits. When he heard Tang Mo’s voice, he ran over.

“Young... Young Master Tang.” The manager looked nervous.

Tang Mo pointed at Granny Qin and the others in front of him and said impatiently, “Who let them in? Where are the security guards? How did you do the security measures?”

The manager said with some fear, “Young Master Tang, our security guards have been killed by them because they tried to stop them...”

“Killed?” When he heard this, Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed!

“You killed that security guard?” Qin Yu looked at Granny Qin coldly.

Granny Qin smiled nonchalantly and said, “Why? Do you care about the life of an ant?”

“F * ck you! The security guard was just doing his job, but you actually killed him. Are you still human!?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but be furious!

He had just promised to have a meal with the security guard, but unexpectedly, in the blink of an eye, he was dead.

Granny Qin sneered and said, “Qin Yu, you even care about the life of an ant. You are destined not to achieve anything big.”

“Screw you! Beast!” Qin Yu clenched his fist and said fiercely.

Tang Mo frowned and said, “Hurry up and get lost. Don’t disturb us. Do you hear me?”

Granny Qin glanced at Tang Mo and said coldly, “Kid, if you don’t want to die, shut up!”

Tang Mo couldn’t help but sneer. “Old b*stard, don’t be so shameless. Do you think I’m afraid of you?”

Just as Granny Qin was about to speak, a purple-robed man beside her whispered, “This person is the Young Master of the Tang family. It’s best not to offend the Tang family in Tang City.”

Granny Qin sneered even more.

“So what if he’s the Young Master of the Tang family? It’s just a small aristocratic family from a remote mountain village. How dare he challenge the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?” Granny Qin sneered.

“A small aristocratic family from a remote mountain village?” Tang Mo’s eyes immediately widened.

Granny Qin placed her hands behind her back and said indifferently, “That’s right. A trifling Tang City is just a place in the middle of nowhere.”

“When the cat’s away, the mice will play. Do you really think you’re a descendant of some aristocratic family?”

“Go out and take a walk. See the outside world.”

Granny Qin’s incessant chatter immediately made Tang Mo’s face flush red.

Tang Mo, who had always been flattered by others, had never suffered such humiliation.

“You... you actually look down on our family!” Tang Mo gritted his teeth, his face flushed.

Granny Qin snorted. “What Tang family? I’ve never even heard of it!”

“I don’t care what aristocratic family you are a descendant of. Go back and tell your father. Ask him if he knows of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”

Tang Mo gritted his teeth and said, “Okay, okay. I will definitely tell my father!”

Granny Qin seemed to want to say something else. A purple-robed man, who was at the side, tugged at Granny Qin and said in a low voice, “Granny Qin, the Tang family isn’t simple. It’s better for us to be careful.”

“Not simple? It’s just a bunch of unruly people from the barren mountains and rivers,” Granny Qin mocked.

A purple-robed man said somewhat anxiously, “Tang City is named after the Tang family! The Tang family has dozens of Martial Marquises. If they really go berserk, even Jingdu’s aristocratic family might not be able to withstand it!”

Granny Qin was immediately stunned.

Dozens of Martial Marquises? A mere Tang City actually had such a martial aristocratic family?

Although the Jingdu Martial Arts Association wasn’t afraid of any family, this place was still extremely far from Jingdu! It would be too late to find people!

Granny Qin withdrew the killing intent from her body. Although she felt a little regretful, she naturally couldn’t lose face in front of so many people.

Therefore, Granny Qin only snorted and said, “Qin Yu, you’re lucky today. Just you wait.”

After saying this, Granny Qin left with her people.

The clubhouse became quiet.

Meanwhile, Tang Mo was so angry that his entire body was trembling.

“Damn it, she actually looked down on our family! She said that when the cat’s away, the mice will play!” Tang Mo said angrily.

“No, she said that you’re monkeys.” Qin Yu added fuel to the flames.

“Yes, she actually said that we are monkeys!” Tang Mo suddenly jumped up in anger!

Not only did Granny Qin not praise him, but she also belittled the Tang family?

This was simply intolerable!

” I want to see how capable this bullsh*t martial arts association is!” Tang Mo said angrily.

“Qin Yu, they are also here for the herbs, right?” Tang Mo asked.

Qin Yu quickly nodded and said, “Yes! Young Master Tang, those ten-thousand-year-old herbs can’t fall into the hands of such people!”

Tang Mo gritted his teeth and said, “Of course! Qin Yu, follow me home to find my father. I want to show them the power of my family!”T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m
