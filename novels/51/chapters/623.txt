Chapter 624: Heading to Jingdu Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

There were still countless inner cores under the island. The Jingdu Martial Arts Association naturally wouldn’t miss this opportunity.

They would send people to retrieve the inner cores almost every day and bring them back to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

“Qin Yu died here, right?” Someone pointed at the gate of the Immortal Slaying Sect.

“Yes, I heard that he was slapped back by Mr. Yan.”

“Serves him right. He has caused us a lot of trouble.”

Hearing their sarcasm, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

“Put down all the inner cores.” Qin Yu’s voice came from behind them.

Hearing this, they all hurriedly turned around.

Looking at the bearded young man in front of them, they couldn’t help but sneer. “Who are you? Who told you to come here? How dare you talk to us like that?”

Qin Yu closed his eyes and said coldly, “How many inner cores did you take? Hand them all over.”

“Are you courting death?!” The few of them were obviously angered by Qin Yu.

They strode forward with surging internal qi.

“You don’t know your place.” Qin Yu opened his eyes. In the next second, he waved his hand and smashed a person’s head!

When they saw this, their expressions instantly changed greatly!

“You... who exactly are you?!” Someone asked in surprise.

Qin Yu grinned and said, “I’m Qin Yu. Unfortunately, I’m not dead.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Everyone’s faces instantly became extremely pale!

Someone even hurriedly said, “Mr. Qin, we are only following orders. Please spare our lives!”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I’m sorry. I don’t want the Jingdu Martial Arts Association to know that I’m still alive for the time being, so... It’s better for all of you to die!”

Qin Yu took a step forward. The terrifying force crushed these people into meat paste!

After killing these people, Qin Yu took out all the inner cores on their bodies and put them into his pocket.

Then, Qin Yu and the man with the mustache moved forward together and began to harvest the inner cores under the island.

Only after filling up the Spatial Magic Artifact did the two of them plan to leave.

Qin Yu took a hat from these people and put it on his head to avoid any unnecessary complications.

“Let’s go.” Qin Yu looked at the man with the mustache.

The two of them returned to the island.

“Where do you plan to go next?” Qin Yu looked at the man with the mustache and asked.

The man with the mustache muttered, “I plan to go to Jingdu. Rumor has it that there will be an auction in Jingdu.”

“Auction?” Qin Yu frowned and then asked, “What auction?”

The man with the mustache explained, “The Jingdu Martial Arts Association will sell a batch of treasures every few years.”

“Although they say it’s a treasure, it’s actually an obsolete item of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

“Since it’s an obsolete item, is there still a need to go?” Qin Yu asked, puzzled.

The man with the mustache widened his eyes and said, “Of course! If their obsolete items are in my hands, they might still be usable.”

“Moreover... There are people who pick up scraps from this auction every year.”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “When is it?”

The man with the mustache fiddled with his fingers and calculated, then said, “About a week.”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, then said, “I also plan to go to Jingdu. Then we’ll meet in Jingdu.”

It just so happened that Qin Yu also planned to go to Jingdu and secretly investigate the background of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

Qin Yu had never been particularly clear about the strength of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

In addition, Qin Yu’s identity was too complicated, which resulted in Qin Yu not having the opportunity to investigate the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

After parting with the man with the mustache, Qin Yu planned to return to the Green Moon Villa for the time being.

After disappearing for four to five months, Qin Yu had no idea what had happened in the outside world.

After leaving here, Qin Yu rushed to Cangzao City.

In the evening, Qin Yu arrived at the gate of the Green Moon Villa.

However, the first thing he saw was the plaque of the Saint Confucian Sect.

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu frowned.

“Deng Sheng?” Qin Yu murmured in a low voice, as if he had guessed something.

He didn’t continue thinking and strode into the Green Moon Villa.

The Green Moon Villa was even more powerful than the Saint Confucian Sect. It was said that there were nearly a thousand disciples!

At a glance, the grand scene was unprecedented.

Qin Yu pulled a random person and asked, “Where is Sect Master Zhen?”

“What Sect Master Zhen? You’re new, right? There’s only Sect Master Deng here without Sect Master Zhen!”

Qin Yu frowned.

Sure enough, Deng Sheng had changed sides.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He released his divine sense and quickly caught Zhen Yue’s position.

Zhen Yue was now under house arrest in her own room. Although her daily necessities and demands were met, there were very few places for activities.

Qin Yu’s body flashed and he walked straight in.

As soon as he entered, he saw Zhen Yue sitting in front of the table, drunk.

Qin Yu frowned. He walked to Zhen Yue’s side and whispered, “Zhen Yue, wake up.”

In a daze, Zhen Yue opened her eyes and saw Qin Yu in front of her. She waved her hand weakly and said, “F * ck, I’m dreaming again.”

After saying that, Zhen Yue fell asleep again.

Qin Yu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He had no choice but to raise his palm and put it on Zhen Yue’s forehead while using his spiritual energy to forcefully revive her.

A moment later, Zhen Yue woke up in a daze.

She rubbed her eyes and said in surprise, “Qin Yu, you...”

“Shh.” Qin Yu hurriedly covered her mouth and said in a low voice, “Don’t shout.”

Zhen Yue nodded hard, and Qin Yu let go of her hand.

“Mr. Qin, you’re not dead?” Zhen Yue was surprised and excited.

Qin Yu nodded and asked, “What’s going on? How did this Green Moon Villa become the Saint Confucian Sect?”

Zhen Yue opened her mouth and sighed.

She told Qin Yu everything that had happened.

Through their conversation, Qin Yu learned that all the sects in the north were under the management of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

And the managers were the three powerhouses they had trained.

“During the time you disappeared, many young masters in Jingdu had reached the middle stage of the Martial Marquis Realm, and the Martial Arts Association had created a peak martial artist. You... you’d better be careful,” Zhen Yue said worriedly.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes without showing much shock.

“Zhen Yue, I’m afraid you’ll have to suffer for a while,” Qin Yu said to Zhen Yue.

Zhen Yue asked with some confusion, “What are you going to do?”

Qin Yu said coldly, “After I find out the background of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, I’ll take back the Green Moon Villa.”

After saying this, Qin Yu left the Green Moon Villa and headed straight for Jingdu.

At night, Xia Hang staggered back home.

As the vice-president, his main responsibility was to maintain good relations with the various aristocratic families, so he was drunk almost every day, and today was no exception.

Xia Hang returned home. As soon as he opened the door, he saw a young man sitting on the sofa and looking at him coldly.

Seeing the young man in front of him, Xia Hang instantly sobered up.
