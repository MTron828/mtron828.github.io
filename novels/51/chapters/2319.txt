2320 The Time Is Pressing

“Nature’s spiritual energy in purgatory is incomparably thin. Many are convicted people exiled by the Holy Region.”

“With the strength of that group of trash, it’s difficult to resist if the three races attack the human race in full force. Therefore, we have to prepare as soon as possible.”

Si Liuhe looked indifferent and did not look scared at all. He further explained, “Therefore, we need the cultivators of the Holy Region to head to purgatory at the right time to command them, defend against the attacks from the three races, and protect the Holy Region.”

“Yes. As long as the Holy Region is safe, we naturally can nurture countless cultivators. Even if the three races join forces, they can’t do anything to us.”

The head of the Jiang family nodded.

“Who will go to purgatory? Who will decide the name list?”

A True Saint cultivator from a small aristocratic family asked.

“Of course, the top nine families will decide. Are you suggesting that you should be the one to decide?”

Yao Xi stared at him coldly. “Everyone of the aristocratic families needs to do their best. This matter is of great importance to the human race. Moreover, even if they arrive at the Holy Region, the trash from purgatory would rush to the front. Even if someone has to die, it won’t be your turn to die first.”

“It’s easier said than done. In times of chaos, seven or eight out of ten families will die. We can’t accept it if your nine great aristocratic families simply make arrangements.”

The person also refused to back down and responded to Yao Xi with a cold snort.

“Alright, I gathered you here today to warm you up. Perhaps this is just a spatial anomaly.”

Yan Tianshi waved his hand to stop the quarrel.

“Moreover, the sign of times of chaos also means that the golden Path of Heaven is about to arrive. Everyone, be prepared to welcome this wave of Path of Heaven and strive to break through directly to the Tribulation Transcending Stage.”

“So what if the three races join forces? We’ll suppress them again if the ghost and monster race dare to descend. I can directly break through to the Tribulation Transcending Stage when the Path of Heaven descends. Who can stop me when the time comes?”

A person suddenly stood up. The internal qi he emitted made people tremble in fear.

However, no one doubted it because the person before them was the chosen one, Teng Zixu.

After becoming a True Saint, his cultivation rose steadily.

Even Tian Zhe, a fourth and fifth-grade True Saint, could break through without any hindrance.

In just 50 years, he had already reached the peak of True Saint and was waiting for the Path of Heaven to descend for the breakthrough.

…

Several days later.

“Uncle Yan, will anything happen to Qin Yu? When the time comes, and if there’s a battle in purgatory, Uncle Yan, help me fight for a spot. I must go.”

On Mount Donghuang, Yan Ruoxue looked worried.

“Miss Yan, I’m afraid that I don’t have the final say in this matter.”

“Liu He, how is Shiyue now? He has already been in retreat for nearly 70 years! If he comes out of seclusion too late during the descent of the Great Dao, others will probably snatch all the opportunities.”

The Holy Lord of the Si family paced back and forth anxiously.

“Why is the rush? You don’t look like a Holy Lord at all.”

Si Liuhe reprimanded him, not showing him any respect. “Shiyue has comprehended the rules of the five elements, equivalent to the combination of the five Great Dao of Heaven and Earth. Once he comes out of seclusion, he will be invincible and reach the Peak of True Saint.”

He sneered. “So what if he’s the chosen one? Once the tide of Path of Heaven descends, with the Si family’s foundation, wiping out the Teng family will be a piece of cake.”

“Great, great. I’m relieved to hear this.”

“Right now, the most important thing is Yan Ruoxue’s bloodline. After Shiyue comes out of seclusion, he must get married immediately without further delay.”

“With the bloodline of the Si family combined with the bloodline of heaven and earth, perhaps the first person to enter the Tribulation Transcending Stage in the entire Holy Region will come from the Si family before the Path of Heaven descends. When the time comes, those who obeyed will prosper, and those who resist will die.”

…

In purgatory…

After several days of sailing, Qin Yu and the rest finally arrived at the Solitary Cloud City.

He let go of everyone. At this moment, many more people in Solitary Cloud City were seeking refuge.

The ordinary people looked around blankly, not knowing where to go.

“Mom, I want to find Mom.”

“Where’s Grandpa and Grandma?”

Several children suddenly burst into tears, and their cries were contagious.

Many children burst into tears.

Looking at the malicious gazes of the surrounding cultivators, Qin Yu hesitated for a while and sent a voice transmission to Ji Yue.

“I have some ordinary people here. Help me settle them down. Tell me the price when the time comes.”

“Alright, but the fees won’t be cheap with so many people.”

“You’re pretty fast at gathering information.”

Qin Yu thought to himself.

Ji Yue must have her own methods to become the owner of the Moon Listening Pavilion in Solitary Cloud City.

She was not worried that Qin Yu would go back on his words. Soon, she arranged for a group of people to come over and handle these people’s food and accommodation.

Qin Yu sighed deep down. This was all he could do now.

Who knew how many of these people he brought with him would survive in the end?

“Qin Yu, you owe me a favor.”

Ji Yue stared at him with a smile.

“What favor? It’s not that you don’t want money.”

“In this world, even if you have money, you can’t do anything. For example, if these ordinary people are purely rich, they will only be fat sheep for others.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“That’s true.”

Qin Yu agreed with this point. These ordinary people who worked hard would have no way out if they were targeted by ruthless cultivators.

“Qin Yu, I want you to promise me that you will definitely protect me within the limits of your ability if I encounter any danger.”

Ji Yue said solemnly. With her resources, she already gathered a lot of information.

“Alright.”

Qin Yu nodded without hesitation.

“Alright, I like people like you who are straightforward. Qin Yu, let me give you a piece of news. The yellow Great Dao in the Holy Region is about to arrive. The Path of Heaven will no longer suppress anyone’s strength when the time comes. You must prepare yourself.”

Ji Yue looked solemn, which was rare. She was no longer smiling like before.

Qin Yu frowned. That meant there might be a True Saint who would directly break through to the Tribulation Transcending Stage!

It was tremendously difficult to break through to the Tribulation Transcending Stage, and there were not many Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivators in the entire Holy Region.

However, the resources in the Holy Region were far from what the purgatory could compare to. Moreover, there was also the chosen one.

Suddenly, Qin Yu thought of a terrifying thing.

Once the Golden Great Dao completely descended, the suppression of any cultivator would be released.

This meant cultivators in the Tribulation Transcending Stage could attack at will.

Xing Xiu!

When he had just gone to the Black Platform Continent, he had used the power of annihilation he comprehended to return to a wisp of his divine sense.

This had already become a deadly feud that would not rest until one of them died. This person would probably look for him directly when the time comes.

With the ability of a Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivator, as long as he was still in this galaxy, he would probably be found in an instant.

“Alright, let’s not talk anymore. I have something to deal with.”

Now that the tide of the Path of Heaven was surging, he might have a chance to break through to fifth grade.

At this moment, Qin Yu did not even bother to use his treasure. He directly stepped the line word formula and quickly headed to the eighth level of purgatory.

…

In a misty area of the Black Platform Continent, a figure was having a phantom moving in his hand.

Countless Path of Heavens shuttled through his hands, turning into the real images.

Suddenly, he clenched his fist, and a ferocious expression appeared on his face.
