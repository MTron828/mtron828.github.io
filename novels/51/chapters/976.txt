Chapter 977: Chapter 977, all his trump cards were revealed

Qin Yu’s punch made everyone tremble.

Even though they were far away, they could still feel the powerful strength on that fist.

Qin Yu clenched his right hand into a fist. Golden light flashed, extremely dazzling.

However, not far away, white bones did not move at all.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said coldly, “Come, let me see just how powerful this almighty body is!”

Following Qin Yu’s furious roar, his feet instantly moved, and in the blink of an eye, he arrived in front of the white bones!

Qin Yu bent his legs, and his body suddenly bounced up. A huge golden light came down from the sky, and fiercely smashed towards the white bones!

The attack method of the white bones was extremely simple. It could only use its steel-like body to clench a fist to meet the Attack!

“Bang!”

The Fists finally collided.

One Golden and one white, forming two extremely dazzling visual impacts!

This kind of confrontation caused the entire scene to stir up waves of dust. The ground rapidly sank down, as if a huge earthquake had occurred!

However, even under the influence of the earth-shaking and mountain-shaking, everyone still stared fixedly at the center of the Discussion Martial Hall.

“Whoosh!”

Soon, a figure shot out from the center!

This figure was none other than Qin Yu!

He was sent flying again, and cracks appeared on his fist!

However, the white bones only took five steps back! Not a single white spot was left on his body!

Seeing this scene, everyone could not help but suck in a cold breath!

“What... What kind of body is this? It’s not damaged at all?”

“Could it be that Qin Yu’s punch was just a bluff?”

“Impossible! He had used that punch before, and almost no one could withstand it!”

“After all, there’s too much of a difference in realm between the two sides...”

“Cough Cough Cough!”

Qin Yu began to cough out blood from his mouth, and his face was even paler.

He supported his body and stood up from the ground.

“What a strong body...”Qin Yu wiped the blood at the corner of his mouth and muttered softly.

This was merely the bones of a mighty figure, yet it was already so powerful. Just how powerful was a true mighty figure?

“Let me do it!”Tie Dan said excitedly.

Qin Yu wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth. He was still somewhat unwilling to accept this.

“Qin Yu!”At this moment, Chang Mang finally couldn’t hold it in any longer and jumped down from above.

He ran to Qin Yu in a few steps and supported him.

“How are you? Are You Alright?”Chang Mang asked in a deep voice.

However, Qin Yu’s pupils suddenly constricted and he shouted, “Quickly dodge!”

However, it was already too late. That White Bone’s fist had already ruthlessly smashed towards Chang Mang from behind!

Before Chang Mang could react, he was directly sent flying!

His body crashed into the wall and was buried in the rubble!

“Chang Mang!”Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically!

He knew the power of the white bone. The destructive power of this punch was beyond imagination!

“Ah! !”

But at this moment, Chang Mang rushed out at any moment.

His eyes were scarlet red, like an angry bull.

“Ah! !”Chang Mang roared continuously, and the red light on his body grew stronger.

In the next second, he shot toward the white bone!

Seeing this, Qin Yu could not help but be dumbfounded.

This kid’s body was actually so strong?

Not only did he not die after taking a punch, but he became even stronger?

“The saintly being is not as weak as you think. The saintly being that grew up is not weaker than your chaos body,”tie Dan said in his mind.

Qin Yu looked at Chang Mang who was not far away. He rushed forward and was quickly repelled.

However, Chang Mang was like a cockroach that could not be beaten to death. After falling to the ground, he got up and rushed towards white bones again and again.

This scene not only stunned Qin Yu, but everyone present also widened their eyes.

“F * ck, a warrior...”

“When did such a boorish person appear...”

“He’s simply like a Madman...”

Even though that was the case, the difference in strength between Chang Mang and Bai Gu was still too great. In the end, he was still knocked to the ground and found it difficult to get up.

Qin Yu walked in front of Chang Mang, picked him up, and walked towards the stage.

“Take good care of him.”Qin Yu handed Chang Mang to Yao Meng and Kong Yun.

After that, Qin Yu returned to the battlefield again.

“Interesting, really interesting.”Tian Xuehong couldn’t help but say with a playful tone.

“I didn’t expect there to be so many people in this world with blood in their veins.”

Qin Yu looked at Tian Xuehong coldly and said, “Do you think we will just sit and wait for Death?”

“Hehe, no matter what you do, the ending will be the same,”Tian Xuehong said indifferently.

He seemed to be too lazy to talk to Qin Yu, so he waved his hand and ordered the white bone to charge at Qin Yu again.

“Swoosh!”

Looking at the white bone charging at him, Qin Yu did not dare to be negligent. He could only Dodge quickly.

However, this white bone not only possessed a strong physical body, it also possessed extremely fast speed!

Even Qin Yu, who had undergone training with the immortal crane, was quickly at a disadvantage in terms of speed!

Helpless, Qin Yu could only clench his fist to meet the attack.

However, the result was predictable. With just one punch, the Golden Light on Qin Yu’s body was shattered, but the white bones were not damaged at all.

“Damn it...”

The injuries on Qin Yu’s body became more and more serious. If this continued, he might really die here...

“Hurry up and give me your body!”Tie Dan urged.

“My hands are Itchy already. Hurry up and give it to me!”

Qin Yu could not help but curse in his heart.

Was he really going to give his body to tie Dan?

But what if he did not return it?

Qin Yu had a strong premonition that his father’s attack might only be that one time.

“Bang!”

Before Qin Yu could make a decision, the white bone kicked Qin Yu’s jaw, sending him flying into the air!

Qin Yu turned around and smashed his fist at the head of the white bone. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Clang!”

Unfortunately, the head was the hardest bone, so this punch didn’t have any effect at all!

“Qin Yu, use the bronze sword!”

At this moment, a voice suddenly came from the crowd.

It was none other than the mustache.

He raised his head and said, “That bronze sword could even leave a mark on the gate of the immortal slaying sect, let alone this white bone!”

Qin Yu patted his head.

That’s right! He had actually forgotten about the bronze sword!
