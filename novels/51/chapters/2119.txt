2120 True Saint versus True Saint

Si Liuhe was Qin Yu’s greatest enemy. The stronger he was, the more dangerous Qin Yu would be.

The reason was none other than the Traceless Immortal Scripture in Qin Yu’s hands.

However, at this moment, he was tremendously calm and composed. He was fully focused on the chessboard before him, which surprised Dean Lei.

“Si Liuhe went to the Chaos Grave not long ago,” Dean Lei said casually.

Qin Yu nodded and continued to play chess as if he did not hear him.

“Even I might be no match for Si Liuhe,” Dean Lei said, stroking his beard. “What’s even more frightening is that more True Saints will emerge from the aristocratic families. By then, I’ll probably find it hard to protect myself.”

After hearing this, Qin Yu finally reacted.

He put down the chess piece in his hand and said, “I don’t think so. I don’t believe the aristocratic families would dare to attack Thunder Courtyard.”

“What makes you say that?” Dean Lei asked.

Qin Yu said, “Si Liuhe is obviously so powerful that even you don’t dare to say you can defeat him. However, I don’t think Thunder Courtyard can last until today if it only relies on a few True Saints.”

Then Qin Yu raised his finger and pointed toward Lei Ming’s immortal grave. “This place was once the residence of Immortal Emperor Lei. There were numerous Immortal Emperor techniques left behind. It’s unrealistic for a mere True Saint to cause trouble here.”

“Hahaha!” Dean Lei could not help but stroke his beard and laugh out loud.

He nodded slightly and said, “You were worried when Si Liuhe broke through. Why are you so calm now?”

“You’re the one who reminded me. Moreover, my wisp of divine sense has also seen how Wu Ji walked out of his own path in the Traceless Immortal Scripture,” Qin Yu smiled faintly and said.

Wu Ji faced more difficulties than anyone else. He did not have the Path of Heaven like Qin Yu did and could even be called the abandoned child of the Path of Heaven. However, Wu Ji was still invincible in the world under such circumstances.

In the Traceless Immortal Scripture, Qin Yu saw the words left behind by Wu Ji.

“The path to immortality is vast and boundless. I am willing to sever the heavens at the horizon.

“The Path of Heaven obstructs my path, but I will sever its ties to immortality.”

Although Qin Yu could not fully understand these words, he could see Wu Ji’s determination to fight against the heavens.

A person abandoned by the Path of Heaven never harbored any worries, nor did he destroy his dao mind. Not to mention, Qin Yu’s current predicament was far more insignificant when compared with this.

“I’m afraid Si Liuhe’s next stop will be Thunder Courtyard,” Dean Lei said as he placed his chess piece.

“Yes,” Qin Yu raised his head and looked at the horizon. There seemed to be dark clouds gathering there, and they were about to descend at any moment.

The outside world was still speculating, and many people were waiting for Si Liuhe’s next move.

Si Liuhe didn’t hide his whereabouts at all. He traveled between heaven and earth and visited various aristocratic families for half a year.

During this half a year, the doa techniques between heaven and earth became even more unpredictable. Numerous True Saints seemed about to appear.

No one knew the purpose of Si Liuhe’s trip. Everyone seemed to look forward to the confrontation between Si Liuhe and Thunder Courtyard.

On this day, Si Liuhe was on an uninhabited mountain peak. The surrounding space was sealed, and no one could walk out of it.

The person standing before him was none other than Xuan Jizi, who had deceived the Si family.

“Si Liuhe spent such a long time, but he finally managed to deduce the location of Xuan Jizi.”

“Xuan Jizi is also a True Saint. I wonder if he can defeat Si Liuhe.”

“I’m afraid it’ll be very difficult. Si Liuhe is a new Saint, and Xuan Jizi’s vital energy has long depreciated. How can he be compared to Si Liuhe, who has just been reborn?”

“Si Liuhe is a genius of the world. Even if Xuan Jizi burns his blood essence to recover to his peak state, he is still no match for Si Liuhe.”

“Who, in the world, dares to say they can defeat Si Liuhe?”

Discussing animatedly, the surrounding crowd seemed to be full of anticipation.

Although Si Liuhe had entered the Chaos Grave after steeping into the True Saint Realm, the existence in the sanctum was extraordinary and thus could not be compared with.

Therefore, many people wanted to know who was stronger between Si Liuhe and the other True Saints.

Si Liuhe looked calm. He closed his eyes and placed his hands behind his back as if he did not take Xuan Jizi seriously.

On the contrary, Xuan Jizi’s expression was somewhat unnatural, and there was a hint of panic.

“Si Liuhe, no matter what, I’m your senior. What are you trying to do by sealing the void?” Xuan Jizi pretended to be calm and said.

Si Liuhe slightly closed his eyes and said indifferently, “You cheated the first three chapters of the Si family’s immortal scripture. You must die today.”

Upon hearing this, Xuan Jizi quickly shouted, “When have I ever lied to your Si family? I exchanged it with the supreme bone! What? Are you going back on your word in front of everyone today?”

“Supreme bone?” Si Liuhe raised his eyebrows. “That supreme bone is fake. You should know that.”

“I… I really don’t know!” Xuan Jizi said without confidence.

Si Liuhe waved his hand and said, “Forget it! Forget it! It doesn’t matter anymore. If you’ve taken my Si family’s immortal scripture, you’re doomed to die.”

Xuan Jizi’s expression grew even more panicked. He gritted his teeth and said, “Si Liuhe, I know you’ve stepped into the True Saint Realm. However, if we were to go all out, you might not be my match! No matter what, I’ve studied more techniques than you. You should at least call me Senior!”

“Senior? Who do you think you are?” Si Liuhe sneered and said.

Xuan Jizi was instantly furious and said, “You don’t think that I, Xuan Jizi, am afraid of you!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Is that so?” A trace of amusement flickered across Si Liuhe’s face. He looked at Xuan Jizi and said, “Come on, let me see how capable you are.”

“You’re courting death!” Xuan Jizi was completely enraged!

The internal qi on Xuan Jizi’ss body instantly erupted. The fluctuations of the elemental energy he controlled surged like fierce winds and torrential rain, and the intense power formed a nearly suffocating pressure.

The onlookers could not help but widen their eyes. They had never thought that Xuan Jizi could still burst out such a powerful internal qi when he was nearly exhausted.

However, Si Liuhe’s expression remained calm. He looked at Xuan Jizi and said, “Come on, is this all you have?”

Xuan Jizi was stunned. In the next moment, he gritted his teeth and the power in his body again surged tremendously. All the blood in his body seemed to be burning, and his skin turned red. An even more powerful elemental energy fluctuation almost distorted the surrounding air.

The onlookers could not help but gasp in astonishment. They could not believe the scene in front of them. It was a power that was almost at the peak of True Saint!
