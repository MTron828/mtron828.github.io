Chapter 855: Chapter 855, revenge

Qin Yu’s arrogant tone immediately made the two of them feel some fear.

“Who exactly are you?”The two of them asked coldly.

“I should be the one asking you. Who sent you here? To be able to dispatch five half-step martial saints, you must not be from a nameless sect.”Qin Yu questioned coldly.

“Do you think we will tell you?”

Qin Yu sneered, “Forget it if you don’t want to talk. Who cares what sect it is. If one comes, I will kill one!”

Before he had finished speaking, Qin Yu had already shot out explosively!

His moves were simple and unadorned, only having a firm and fierce fist!

Naturally, the two of them would not sit around and wait for death. They immediately took out their unique skills, raised their palms, and activated their spells.

However, all of their spells were as fragile as paper in front of Qin Yu! The moment they touched each other, they immediately melted!

When the two of them saw this, their pupils immediately constricted. They turned around and wanted to escape!

“You won’t be able to escape.”Qin Yu’s feet shook, and the heavy falling space instantly spread out!

After stepping into the Great Circle, Qin Yu’s heavy falling space also improved!

Not only did the two of them slow down, they even lost their focus for a moment!

One had to know that a moment of carelessness in a battle could result in death, not to mention a moment of loss of focus!

Qin Yu seized this opportunity and smashed his fist like a meteor, directly shattering the two of their heads!

The two half-step martial saints who had been showing off just a moment ago had now become ice-cold corpses.

Qin Yu looked coldly at the five corpses in the square and turned around to dig out the golden cores in their bodies.

After finishing off these people, Qin Yu hurried to the pavilion master’s building.

All the way to the pavilion master’s building.

At this time, the pavilion master was healing herself.

She was only wearing a white gauze coat, gently wiping her wounds.

Such a scene naturally made Qin Yu feel a little embarrassed.

He turned his head to the side and said, “Pavilion Master, are you okay?”

The pavilion master said, “I’m fine.”

“Then... What about Yan Ruoxue?”Qin Yu asked tentatively.

The pavilion master said, “As long as I’m not dead, your little girlfriend will be fine.”

After saying that, the pavilion master waved to Qin Yu and said, “Come here.”

Qin Yu braced himself and looked at the pavilion master. His face immediately turned red.

“Rub these few medicines on my back.”The pavilion master was quite generous.

Although Qin Yu felt a little embarrassed, he couldn’t care too much about saving his life.

He followed the pavilion master’s request and rubbed the herbs on the pavilion master’s body.

A faint medicinal fragrance spread throughout the room.

The Pavilion Master’s expression also eased up a little.

Qin Yu stood up and poured a cup of water for the Pavilion Master. Then, he frowned and asked, “Lord Pavilion Master, who are those people?”

The pavilion master shook his head and said, “I don’t know, but they are here for Yan Ruoxue. Moreover, they won’t be the last wave.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath.

These people’s actions were faster than he had imagined.

“Did you kill those three half-step martial saints?”Qin Yu asked with some doubt.

The pavilion master glanced at Qin Yu with his long and narrow eyes and said, “What else?”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but be stunned!

When did the pavilion master step into such a realm?

“They won’t give up.”At this moment, the pavilion master suddenly said.

Qin Yu grunted and said in a deep voice, “It seems that your place has been exposed. We can only change places.”

However, where would it be safe to go?

“Lord Pavilion Master, please follow me back to the Jade Moon Villa First,”said Qin Yu.

“I will settle this matter as soon as possible within these few days.”

A trace of surprise flashed in the Pavilion Master’s eyes.

“Settle this matter? How?”Asked the pavilion master.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “Since they all want Yan Ruoxue, then I will satisfy them!”

The pavilion master’s frown deepened, as if he didn’t quite understand what Qin Yu meant.

Qin Yu said coldly, “I will spread the news and wait for the fish to take the bait.”

“Wait for the fish to take the bait? Do you know how many people are watching you?”The pavilion master said coldly.

“Qin Yu, as long as you don’t step into the martial saint stage, numbers can cause a qualitative change.”

“You can fight against five half-step martial saints, but you may not be able to fight against ten half-step martial saints.”

“The superposition of their powers is beyond your imagination.”

Qin Yu did not mind. Just as he was about to speak, that sharp pain struck again!

“PFFT!”

Qin Yu immediately spat out a mouthful of blood. His vision went black and he almost fell to the ground.

Seeing this, the pavilion master immediately frowned and asked, “Are you injured?”

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude. He told the pavilion master what had happened.

“I just wanted to ask if there was a way to heal the injuries of my golden core,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

The pavilion master’s expression was extremely ugly.

She stared at Qin Yu and said, “You said... There are cracks on your golden core?”

“Yes.”Qin Yu nodded.

“I don’t know what kind of effect this will have on me.”

The Pavilion Master didn’t say anything for a long time.

A moment later, she sighed slightly and said, “The damage to your Dantian will affect your foundation and your cultivation. It’s too difficult to repair...”

Qin Yu’s expression turned ugly.

“Even you can’t do anything about it.”Qin Yu frowned.

The pavilion master shook his head and said, “It’s not that I can’t do anything about it. It’s just that it’s very difficult.”

“I know of a kind of pill that can repair your Dantian. However, this kind of material has long disappeared.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “What’s the name of the material?”

“Heavenly Vanilla,”said the pavilion master.

“Heavenly vanilla... I got it.”Qin Yu silently memorized the name.

Then, Qin Yu helped the pavilion master up and said, “Let’s change to another place first. The Green Moon Villa might be safer. Moreover, there’s a spiritual spring there, which is also good for healing wounds.”

The pavilion master shook his head and said, “There’s no rush. I still need to make some preparations.”

Seeing this, Qin Yu didn’t force him.

Since he was back now, there was nothing to worry about.

Then, Qin Yu brought Su Qian to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion and arranged a room for her.

Her injuries were not very serious. The Pavilion Master gave Qin Yu a pill. After giving her a pill, her internal Qi gradually stabilized.

At night.

Qin Yu took out his phone and opened the martial arts forum.

It had been a long time since he had logged onto the martial arts forum. The forum seemed to have become even more lively during this period of time.

Qin Yu took a quick glance. Then, he quickly wrote and posted a post on the martial arts forum:

“I am Qin Yu. From today onwards, I will pay a visit to all those who are concerned about Yan Ruoxue.”

“For example, Gu Xinghe from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, as well as the various martial arts aristocratic families and overseas forces. I will not let any of them off.”

“This can be considered a notice, and also a challenge.”

“I hope you will take good care of yourselves.”Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com
