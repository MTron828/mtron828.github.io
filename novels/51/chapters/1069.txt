Chapter 1070: Chapter 1,070, the Furious Yan Jinyao 

The eight pillars of light did not disappear. In the air, other than the smell of blood, there was also a strange internal Qi.

Qin Yu and Immortal Crane did not waste any time. They immediately began to search for the power of the Sky Blood Rainbow in the second mystic realm.

Unfortunately, they had searched the entire second mystic realm, but they still could not find the power brought by this mystic technique.

“That’s strange. Could it be that he has already taken it away?”Qin Yu frowned slightly.

The Immortal Crane shook its head and said, “It’s hard to say. When we left the second secret realm, no one knew if he had returned.”

Qin Yu did not say anything. After thinking for a moment, he shook his head and said, “It’s unlikely. With the character of the Heavenly Blood Rainbow, if he had obtained this power, he would definitely jump out and shout. He would not be as silent as he is now.”

“That means there’s a problem with the method we’re looking for,”said the immortal crane in a low voice.

Qin Yu nodded slightly, then smiled and said, “But there’s no need to be anxious. Gu Zizhen is already dead. This second mystic realm has already become an ownerless object. We can just wait for him here.”

Looking at the bloodstains all around him, Qin Yu felt a little uncomfortable.

Although many people had died in his hands, Qin Yu still found it hard to accept the fact that so many innocent people had died here.

“Let’s stay here for now,”said Qin Yu.

Immortal Crane nodded slightly and said, “We have to take this opportunity to find a way to the first mystic realm.”

Qin Yu felt a little uneasy when this topic was brought up.

According to what the higher-ups said, their true bodies must exist in the first mystic realm.

After this battle, Qin Yu clearly felt the might of a mighty figure.

With his current strength, he had no chance of winning.

Even if he faced a mighty figure with only 50% of his strength, his chances of winning were extremely low.

If he rashly went to the first mystic realm, he would very likely die at their hands.

“Then the higher-ups said that they would open the passage between the first and second mystic realms as soon as possible. Why do we need to find a way?”Qin Yu sighed slightly.

Immortal Crane didn’t say a word. He naturally knew the difference in strength between him and that almighty expert.

“The second Mystic Realm definitely has a secret treasure. Hopefully, we can improve our strength before then.”Qin Yu waved his hand and said.

It was the only thing they could do now.

Zhai Xing buried Gu Zizhen on the top of a mountain.

He knelt on the side of the mountain for an entire night, as if he was keeping a vigil for Gu Zizhen.

“How should we deal with this Zhai Xing?”Immortal Crane stood in front of the window and asked while looking at the distant mountain peak.

Qin Yu said, “Gu Zizhen is already dead. There should be no reason for him to reject US again. We might be able to get some useful information from him.”

The immortal crane nodded slightly, agreeing with this statement.

The battle with the second secret realm had finally come to an end.

At this moment, almost everyone in the outside world was talking about this matter.

This battle would undoubtedly be recorded in the annals of history. No one had expected the enormous second secret realm to fall like this.

“Perhaps Qin Yu will become the next martial arts association of Jingdu.”

“Sigh, the crows in the world are all as black as the dark. At any time, they shouldn’t be the only one. Otherwise, to us, it would be a disaster.”

“No one can stop Qin Yu’s strength. Whether it’s the older generation or the younger generation, no one can be compared to him.”

Looking at the various comments, Yan Jinyao only felt waves of anger. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

He was originally the number one person in the world, but now he had become Qin Yu’s background. How could he tolerate this! !

“I don’t believe that I’m not a match for him, Qin Yu,”Yan Jinyao said coldly, his eyes filled with unwillingness.

“That’s right. I also agree with what you said.”

At this moment, a voice suddenly came.

Yan Jinyao said without turning his head, “Sky Blood Rainbow? You’re actually still alive.”

“Why? Are you surprised?”Sky Blood Rainbow put his hands behind his back and slowly walked behind Yan Jinyao.

At this moment, a terrifying pressure erupted from Yan Jinyao’s body!

Under this pressure, Tian Xuehong’s body was immediately under great pressure and he could not help but bend down!

Although he had tried his best to resist, Tian Xuehong, who had not stepped into the martial saint realm, was no match for Yan Jinyao!

“You are only a half-step martial saint. How dare you come to My Yan family and act so presumptuously?”Yan Jinyao said coldly.

Tian Xuehong forcefully supported his body and said, “Yan Jinyao, I am here to help you.”

“Help me?”Yan Jinyao raised his eyebrows and sneered, “Why does my Yan family need help from others?”

Tian xuehong sneered, “Yan Jinyao, haven’t you realized the reality? With the fall of the second mystic realm, the advantage of your Yan family has long been lost!”

Yan Jinyao’s pupils suddenly constricted, and a huge force immediately pressed down!

“Bang!”

Tian Xuehong’s entire body was instantly smacked to the ground!

“What... What? You Don’t dare to face it?”Tian Xuehong grinned, blood dripping from his mouth.

Yan Jinyao’s expression was somewhat unsightly. Although he didn’t want to admit it, it was the truth.

At this time, Yan Jinyao withdrew the pressure from his body and coldly said, “Speak. What do you want from me?”

Tian Xuehong slowly got up from the ground. He wiped the blood at the corner of his mouth and said, “With your ability, even if you can’t win against Qin Yu, you can still be evenly matched. In addition, with the secret technique of our slaughtering immortal sect, killing him is not a problem.”

“Humph, what’s your purpose for doing this?”Yan Jinyao questioned coldly.

Tian Xuehong rolled his eyes and said, “He ruined my big plan last time, so I naturally want to get rid of him quickly!”

This was obviously not what Tian Xuehong was thinking.

The reason why he let Yan Jinyao Fight Qin Yu was to get Qin Yu out of the second mystic realm.

In this way, he had a chance to sneak into the second mystic realm and take away the power of the ten thousand martial marquises’spiritual senses, so as to recover his strength!
