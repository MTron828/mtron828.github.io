2203 The Pressure

The space formed by the Purgatory Formation was like glass. Wherever the fist wind passed, it shattered.

It was like an eggshell meeting a hammer, with no chance for resistance.

In an instant, the sky regained its clarity after shattering. Everything seemed like a dream.

However, no one could stand on the ground anymore. Everyone’s internal qi withered to the extreme.

“Madman!”

Hei Yun’s face filled with fear, and the internal qi on his body had already withered to the extreme.

“Spare me!”

A group of people knelt on the ground, their bodies shaking like a sieve.

Who could resist such a person?

“Please don’t kill us. We agree to the Senior’s request. We’ll immediately go back and gather 60 percent, no, 80 percent of the spiritual essence, and send it over to Senior! Senior, if you have any other requests, feel free to ask.”

Lin Tong knelt on the ground, his body trembling.

At this moment, he was indeed afraid. After cultivating for a thousand years, he had never thought he would be so close to death!

“I’ll give you guys one day.”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and nodded.

At this moment, he felt dizzy repeatedly. The Traceless Annihilation just now had almost exhausted all the spiritual power in his body.

The most important thing was that in the moment of life and death, he seemed to have grasped a very strange way.

It was different from the power of True Saint. It seemed to be the power of the way.

The last attack of the Purgatory Formation was an attack that surpassed the peak of the True Saint. However, it collapsed hopelessly in the face of the Traceless Annihilation.

“I need your Green Spirit Tree for cultivation.”

Qin Yu came to Yun Qingyun and said softly.

“Senior, please!”

Uncle Qun said hastily.

Qin Yu did not stand on ceremony. His body flashed and he appeared directly on the Yun family’s warship.

The next moment, he sat under the Green Spirit Tree.

“Qingyun, start cultivating the Meridian Circulation Technique Senior gave you immediately! It seems to be a great fortune for our Yun family!”

Even though Uncle Qun had lost a hand, he was still in high spirits.

“Yeah, let’s share it.”

Yun Fengqing nodded, full of anticipation.

“No, Senior only passed it to Qingyun because Qingyun had helped him since the beginning. He might not be happy if someone else cultivated it.”

Uncle Qun shook his head.

Yun Qingyun shuddered and did not dwell on it.

“All cultivators of the Yun family, listen up. From now on, no one is allowed to get close to the warship and disturb Senior’s cultivation.”

Uncle Qun’s voice was transmitted into the minds of every cultivator of the Yun family.

“Interesting, an interesting kid has come to the Black Platform Continent.”

Somewhere in the Black Platform Continent spiritual energy was dense, an invisible spiritual sense swept past Qin Yu and revealed a meaningful smile.

“It’s still not enough.”

Another wisp of spiritual sense let out a light sigh.

“A True Saint using a magical artifact to launch a tribulation strike is still useless.”

Several wisps of spiritual sense interacted near the warship and soon returned to silence.

At this moment, Qin Yu, who was cultivating, seemed to have felt he was being watched. However, when he carefully swept his gaze over, he did not discover anything.

“Dad, we’ve accumulated the spiritual essence for so many years. Are we really going to give it to this outsider?”

Lin Cheng clenched his fists as he looked at the pile of spiritual essence close to a thousand before him.

“If the spiritual essence is gone, we can plunder again. But if we lose our lives, we lose everything. It’s a pity that our Lin family’s ancestor has no response after entering retreat a thousand years ago. Otherwise, I would definitely teach this madman a lesson!”

Lin Cheng sighed softly. He was unwilling, but Qin Yu’s strength made him not dare to take the risk.

“Compared to the Skeleton Gang, we are considered very lucky.”

Thinking of this, he did not say anything else and raised his hand to let people send the spiritual essence to the Yun family’s warship.

Box after box of spiritual essence piled up on the Yun family’s warship. Even Uncle Qun, who had experienced countless storms and challenges, could not help but swallow his saliva.

Usually, even a single piece of spiritual essence could cause a bloody storm.

At this moment, thousands of pieces of spiritual essence were placed before him, but no one dared to have greedy thoughts. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Qin Yu, sitting under the Green Spirit Tree, held the spiritual essence in his hand. Terrifying spiritual energy converged into streams of dense energy that surged into his body, nourishing his depleted dantian.

This terrifying absorption speed caused the spiritual essence to deplete the spiritual energy and to explode one after another.

“Miss Yan, I have good news for you.”

In the Holy Region, at Mount Donghuang, Uncle Yan said to Yan Ruoxue.

“Uncle Yan, you can handle it if it’s a family matter. I need to prepare for a retreat.”

Yan Ruoxue was expressionless. After Qin Yu’s incident, she had been cultivating frantically every day. At this moment, she had already reached the terrifying third-grade True Saint. She had completely unleashed the talent of her bloodline, and the speed was even faster than Holy Son Yan.

“Miss Yan, don’t be anxious. Take a look at this video. It was sent from a contact point of the Holy Region in a distant galaxy. The Yan family has just received it.”

Uncle Yan raised his hand, and the scene of Qin Yu’s battle on the Black Platform Continent appeared in the void.

“I knew you wouldn’t die! So annoying! You made me suffer for so long!”

Yan Ruoxue was stunned, her beautiful eyes staring at the person in the middle.

Drop by drop, large teardrops fell from the eyes like pearls. She might have already followed Qin Yu’s footsteps if it was not for revenge.

“Hahaha, this stinky guy! I knew this guy was born in the year of the dog. He wouldn’t die so easily! Dogs have nine lives!”

Jue Wu rushed out of nowhere and placed a hand on Yan Ruoxue’s shoulder. There was an unconcealable surprise on her face.

“Wow, not bad. Ruoxue, come over and take a look. This brat seems to have improved! I won’t have to worry so much about protecting him in the fights in the future.”

Jue Wu exclaimed and fussed around, bending over with her buttock sticking out, studying and examining the footage repeatedly.

Uncle Yan looked at the two girls chattering and left with a smile.

Yan Ruoxue’s crazy cultivation in the past few months really made his heart ache.

When Qin Yu was around, she was like a girl of this age. After Qin Yu left, she seemed to have become a machine without emotions. Fortunately, Qin Yu did not die.

“Why isn’t this little b*stard dead yet?”

The head of the Yao family stared at the image with an ugly expression.

“One man against a city. I’m afraid this little fellow’s strength will soon surpass yours.”

In a secluded place in Zhongzhou, Xiao Hai smiled at Xiao Sheng.

“I’m going to cultivate.”.

Xiao Sheng said softly.

“You have pressure, do you? Hahaha.”

Xiao Hai laughed heartily.

“Hahaha, I knew Brother Qin Yu wouldn’t die!”

The group of people from Demon-slaying Peak shouted in excitement, and the peak master of Demon-slaying Peak was even more pleased.

“This kid is really shocking. He has brought us surprises repeatedly.”

Dean Lei finished speaking and looked at Flower Granny as he laughed softly.

Teng Zixu and Si Shiyue were also staring at the image. Qin Yu, far away in the Black Platform Continent, did not know how much pressure he had brought on the geniuses of the Holy Region.
