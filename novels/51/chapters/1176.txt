Chapter 1177: Chapter 1,177, the Yan family of the Holy Region 

Qin Yu said in surprise, “Looking for something? Looking for what?”

“Don’t interrupt if you shouldn’t ask,”Lu Guan snorted.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “Okay, how many people do you need?”

“At least ten people,”Lu Guan said.

“Then... what are the requirements for cultivation?”Qin Yu thought for a moment and asked.

Hearing this, Lu Guan could not help but sneer in his heart.

“I need ten mighty figures. Can You Find Them?”Lu Guan said with a strange tone.

“That’s right. What kind of cultivation realm can a place like yours have? As long as they are alive, it’s enough,”Lu Yun said.

The mockery in their tone was not hidden, and the room could not help but feel a little awkward.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Look at what you’re saying. You’re only at the advanced stage of the Martial Saint Stage, and you’re still far from the Almighty Stage.”

A trace of displeasure flashed across Lu Guan’s face as he said coldly, “The advanced stage of the martial saint stage can be considered the peak stage in your group, right? Why, from the meaning in your words, it seems that you still look down on our stage?”

“That’s not true, but it’s not worth thinking highly of.”Qin Yu took a sip of his tea and said indifferently.

The two elders were at odds with each other. Seeing that the atmosphere had become somewhat strange, Fang Yue hurriedly tried to smooth things over. “You two seniors must be joking. We definitely don’t have such intentions. I wonder when you will need it?”

Only then did Lu Guan Notice Fang Yue at the side. Just as he was about to flare up, his eyes went wide.

Beautiful, too beautiful!

This Fang Yue in front of him was so beautiful that it was soul-stirring. Even in the Holy Region, she could definitely be considered top-notch!

And the faintly discernible charm on her body was pressing straight into his mind, making him unable to extricate himself!

Compared to Fang Yue, Lu Yun next to him instantly turned into a green leaf.

“Mr. Lu Guan, my friend is asking you a question,”Qin Yu reminded him.

Lu Guan came back to his senses. He coughed and said, “Tomorrow. We need to have a good rest today.”

After saying that, Lu Guan looked at Fang Yue and said with a smile, “Miss, How Old Are you this year?”

Fang Yue had seen many people, so she naturally saw through Lu Guan’s intentions.

She smiled faintly and said, “Senior Lu Guan, don’t you know that a girl’s age is not allowed to be asked?”

Her words made Lu Guan, who was already filled with lust, even more fascinated.

He opened his mouth and was about to say something when Lu Yun coughed and said, “Alright, it’s getting late. Hurry up and make the arrangements.”

Lu Guan put away his lust and nodded. “Miss, I hope you can go tomorrow too. I’ll show you our ability to move mountains and seas!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Qin Yu waved his hand and ordered a man and a woman to tidy up a room.

After they left, Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh, “So this is from the Holy Region? It looks like a two-to-one match.”

“I agree.”Yao Qing came up from nowhere.

“Although this Lu Guan isn’t very decent, we still need them to go to the holy region. It’s better not to offend them,”Zhen Yue said in a low voice.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Got it. You guys should rest early.”

The next day.

Lu Guan ran to Fang Yue’s door early in the morning and stood there. He even picked a wild flower from the roadside, which made him look more like an idiot.

Not long after, Fang Yue pushed the door open.

She had already noticed Lu Guan at the door, but she still pretended to be surprised. Then, she said shyly, “Senior Lu Guan, what are you doing? You Scared Me...”

Her sweet words made Lu Guan feel like he was about to die.

He licked his lips and pretended to be a gentleman. Then, he handed the flower to Fang Yue, he said in a scholarly manner, “On the way here, I saw a small flower. I don’t know why, but when I saw this flower, i inexplicably thought of Miss Fang. Maybe this is fate. Please accept the flower.”

Fang Yue looked at the Carnation in Lu Guan’s hand and didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

After taking the flower, Lu Guan put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “I wonder if Miss Fang wants to go to the Holy Region?”

“Yes, of course I do. I want to go to the holy region even in my dreams,”Fang Yue said with a smile.

Lu Guan was delighted and said proudly, “Miss Fang, this spot is in my hands. As long as I’m happy, I can take you to the holy region at any time!”

“Thank you very much, senior Lu Guan,”Fang Yue said with a smile.

Just as the two of them were talking, Qin Yu suddenly appeared from behind.

“Mr. Lu Guan, everyone is ready. When do we leave?”

Qin Yu’s sudden appearance gave Lu Guan a fright.

He said with a dark face, “What are you anxious for? The emperor is not anxious, but the eunuch is.”

Qin Yu said with slight surprise, “Mr. Lu Guan is actually a eunuch? Could it be that the holy region is so feudal?”

“You are the F * cking eunuch!”Lu Guan was anxious. He stared at him and said, “Kid, are you playing with me?”

“I don’t dare,”Qin Yu said with a faint smile.

“Okay, let’s get down to business.”Lu Yun also walked over.

Lu Guan pointed at Qin Yu and said, “Kid, Watch Your Mouth!”

Qin Yu didn’t want to argue with Lu Yun. He took Fang Yue and Lu Guan to the square.

On the way, Qin Yu touched his chin and said, “Mr. Lu Guan, since you’re from the Holy Region, you should know a lot about the holy region, right?”

Lu Guan Glanced at Qin Yu. He didn’t want to talk to Qin Yu at first, but in order to show off in front of the beauty, he snorted and said, “Not to mention knowing astronomy and geography, it’s more or less the same.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu hurriedly asked, “Have you heard of the Yan Family? The Yan family of the Holy Region.”

“Of course I have,”Lu Guan said proudly.

At this time, he suddenly realized something and frowned. “You also know of the Yan family of the Holy Region?”
