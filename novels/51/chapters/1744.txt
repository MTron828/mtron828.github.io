Chapter 1745: The Reversion Void Stage

Qin Yu stuffed the Reversion Void Pill into his mouth without any hesitation!

The moment he swallowed it, Qin Yu felt a hot aura flowing through his body. Then, his body was filled with a powerful and terrifying force!

The power was so terrifying that it forced Yong Ji to take a few steps back!

The wounds on Qin Yu’s body were also slowly recovering at this moment.

!!

“What?”

Sensing the rapid increase in Qin Yu’s aura, Yuan Xiu also looked in his direction.

He squinted his eyes and said in a low voice, “A pill?” Hehe, relying on medicinal pills to forcefully increase your strength, is this kid crazy? But… Finally, I have a worthy opponent.”

Yuan Xiu could sense that Qin Yu was extremely terrifying after reaching the Reversion Void Stage. His aura was far more powerful than that of Qu Zhu and Wen Wanchong!

He put his hands behind his back and looked at Qin Yu quietly. Then, he hooked his finger and said, “Come, let me see how strong you are at the Reversion Void Stage.”

However, the growth of Qin Yu’s aura did not stop. It was still bursting forth at an extremely fast speed!

The ground under his feet was directly shattered by this force, and a tyrannical shock wave swept out in all directions!

Everyone’s expression changed drastically! Yong Ji’s expression was especially ugly!

“How is that possible?” Yong Ji gritted his teeth.

Qin Yu’s aura had far surpassed his!

In other words, once Qin Yu entered the Reversion Void Stage, his strength would definitely be above his!

However, Qin Yu’s aura did not stop there. It was still growing rapidly!

Yong Ji wasn’t the only one who was shocked. Even Yuan Xiu narrowed his eyes.

“This kid… He actually has such terrifying power?” Yuan Xiu frowned.

He Teng, who was not far away, heaved a sigh of relief.

‘This way, this brat wouldn’t die here.’ He Teng thought to himself.

Qin Yu’s strength burst out at an extremely fast speed.

He closed his eyes slightly and felt the surging power filling his body.

“So this is the Reversion Void Stage?” Qin Yu looked down at his arm. He clenched his fist gently, and an extremely vast power surged from all directions!

It was no exaggeration to say that Qin Yu was extremely confident at the moment. He even felt that he was not afraid of anyone under the sky!

Yuan Xiu not far away finally noticed that something was wrong.

He had acknowledged Qin Yu in the beginning, but now he was a little afraid.

This was because the power was too strong, so strong that he had no confidence.

“No, I have to stop him as soon as possible.” Yuan Xiu said coldly.

Immediately, Yuan Xiu stepped forward and put his hands together. A terrifying force was then directed at Qin Yu!

However, in the face of this force, Qin Yu did not waste any time and raised his hand to meet it with a punch.

“Boom!”

All of the aura dissipated at this moment as it was shattered by Qin Yu’s devastating punch!

As for Yuan Xiu himself, he was forced to take three steps back by this aura. His palm even felt a little numb. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“That’s not right. This brat is probably not weaker than Xiao Sheng!” Yuan Xiu’s face turned cold as he sensed that something was amiss!

After an unknown period of time, Qin Yu’s aura finally stopped growing.

However, at this moment, Qin Yu’s body was filled with power, which had already made everyone feel afraid!

“What’s going on? How could Qin Yu have such terrifying power?”

“It seems like he has swallowed some kind of pill. Don’t forget that Qin Yu is an alchemist!”

“That means we have hope?”

The crowd stared at Qin Yu, whose face was cold after the anger.

His eyes, which were as cold as the dead of winter, made people tremble and not dare to look him in the eye!

“Detestable…”

Yong Ji gritted his teeth. No matter how unwilling he was, he did not dare to provoke Qin Yu at this moment!

Therefore, he immediately retreated to the side, for fear of being targeted by Qin Yu.

“Master, Big Brother Qu Zhu, step aside.” Qin Yu looked at Wen Wanchong and Qu Zhu.

The two of them nodded. At this moment, they had already lost the ability to fight, so they did not say much.

The next second, Qin Yu’s gaze fell on Yuan Xiu.

“You’re indeed quite strong. No wonder even Xiao Sheng thinks so highly of you,” Yuan Xiu snorted and said.

Qin Yu ignored his nonsense and walked toward Yuan Xiu step by step.

Yuan Xiu crossed his arms and said indifferently, “Come on, let me experience it… Pfft!”

Before Yuan Xiu could finish his sentence, Qin Yu had already thrown a punch at him!

The punch was aimed at Yuan Xiu’s face and sent him flying!

Everyone gasped at the sight!

“So straightforward!”

“Really… What a terrifying power…”

“Yuan… Yuan Xiu seems to have been forced back!”

Yuan Xiu’s body smashed through countless mountain peaks before he finally stopped.

Yuan Xiu was pinned to the ground by the ruins.

Qin Yu didn’t want to waste time talking to him at all. Because the Reversion Void Pill’s time was limited, Qin Yu directly clenched his golden fist and smashed it into the ruins!

“Boom, boom, boom!”

Each of his punches contained an unparalleled and terrifying power. All spell techniques paled in comparison, and even the sky seemed to tremble!

Large areas of the void were shattered, and the ground where Yuan Xiu was standing was filled with scars. It was as if an intense battle had just taken place!

After hundreds of punches, the mountain had already collapsed. Not even gravel was left, as it was turned into powder by the remaining power of the fist and drifted away with the wind.

Everything quieted down. Qin Yu looked down at Yuan Xiu coldly.

“Is… Is he dead?”

“No… I don’t know. It’s crazy…”

“It looks like Yuan Xiu is about to be beaten to death…”

No one knew the result, and Yong Ji and the others had a bad feeling.

“Ah!”

At this moment, the furious roars of Yuan Xiu erupted from underground! Then, they saw a gigantic heavenly ax slashing toward Qin Yu!

Although it was formed by dao techniques, it was an ancient divine weapon after all. Even Qin Yu did not dare to resist it with his body.

His palm trembled as he took out the iron rod. He then held the iron rod in his hand and met the gigantic ax head-on!

“Boom!”

This was a terrifying collision, and the aftershock shattered everything in the surroundings. The so-called dao techniques no longer existed, and it was as if this place had become an independent world!

Many people couldn’t dodge in time and spat out blood from the shock. Those who weren’t strong were directly turned into blood mist!

Yuan Xiu appeared in front of the crowd again with his gigantic ax.

His body looked extremely miserable, but it was also healing at an extremely fast speed.

This was the terror of Yuan Xiu, or rather, the terror of the Immortal Slaying Sect!

“He actually didn’t die.” Qin Yu looked at Yuan Xiu coldly. “As expected of the Lord of North Plain.”
