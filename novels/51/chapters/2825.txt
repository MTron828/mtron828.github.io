Chapter 2826: The Blood Rain of the Heaven Ritual

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio  Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The most terrifying thing was that those with powerful bloodlines had already been wiped out one by one.

Most people left behind were ordinary people with low cultivation and talent.

Once all the powerful people here were eliminated, the remaining people would undoubtedly be like pigs and dogs, completely becoming the slaughtering targets of the monster race.

“We don’t expect anything else now. We hope the human race won’t suffer so much pain on this isolated continent.”

The middle-aged man in front of them slowly knelt.

Then, many more people came up and knelt to Jiang Shengling.

These people were almost all cultivators above the Dao Consciousness Realm. They were also the ones who were willing to die this time.

Qin Yu felt a little suffocated. What kind of despair would make these people make such a choice?

Could even these people not do it?

“The Eight Desolates Beast Domain covers a third of the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom. Although we used this ancient ship of the Divine Realm, we still spent half a month to come here. Even if we can clear out all the cultivators, I’m afraid it would be another disaster for the humans living here.”

Leng Yuanxun sighed.

“This is an overt scheme of absolute power. These people represent their regions to offer sacrifices in exchange for the living space of the humans here. In exchange, these cultivators will die, and their blood will replace the lives of many ordinary people.”

“Heh! This is the first time I’ve seen some people are willing to die. How stupid!”

The corners of Yi Xing’s mouth curled into a cold smile.

However, the expressions of the people kneeling in front did not change at all. It was unknown what kind of despair made them make such a choice.

“Shut the f*ck up, da*n bald donkey!”

Fatty Situ saw that Yi Xing was still making sarcastic remarks and immediately pointed at him angrily.

“Hahaha! Am I wrong? A cultivator at your level has already cultivated to the peak power. However, you still want to surrender. Isn’t that ridiculous? Moreover, they will also slaughter all these ordinary people one day.”

Yi Xing laughed out loud.

Qin Yu shook his head. It was obvious that these people must have seen through such simple things.

They just had a deeper reason to make such a helpless choice.

“I won’t interfere with your decisions.”

Jiang Shengling closed the book in his hand. A hint of sadness flashed across his face.

“Thank you. The day of the Heaven Ritual will be in three days. Once the Heaven Ritual is completed, the humans here can live for another ten years.”

The middle-aged man lightly kowtowed three times on the ground.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Everyone was sitting outside the core mountain range of the Eight Desolates Beast Domain that night. The atmosphere was deathly silent.

No matter how one looked at it, these people were all humans.

Many people felt an indescribable pressure in their hearts when they saw them choosing to die.

“Brother Leng, can I ask you a question?”

Qin Yu walked to the side of the vice-captain, Leng Yuanxun.

“Go ahead.”

Leng Yuanxun opened his eyes.

“I also encountered such a thing in the lower realm. Can this trend be reversed?”

Qin Yu asked seriously.

“This place is still considered good. At the very least, only a quarter of the area is under the alien races’ control. If it were any other Saint Kingdoms, the area where humans can live would only be around 10 – 20%. Almost all the humans in the Land of Eye of Destruction Shimoji are eliminated. The remaining people are only used for reproduction.”

Leng Yuanxun and Jiang Shengling had been traveling in the Saint World for many years, so he knew these things better.

“Even the Saint Kingdom of the human race can’t do this?”

After a moment of silence, Qin Yu spoke again.

“The general trend is like dark clouds destroying a city. How can it be reversed? In the past thousand years, Saint Chen Shuang had cleared out alien races ten times in this beast region. However, their number quickly returned to its previous level after each elimination. Even the number of experts who had awakened their peak power increased like bamboo shoots after rain. Not only did this waste Chen Shuang’s time, but it was also useless.”

“What exactly is this Path of Heaven? What right does it have to control humans like pigs and dogs?”

Qin Yu roared angrily.

The people who knelt today had touched him too deeply.

“Many people are searching for the answer, but it seems we are getting further and further away.”

Leng Yuanxun raised his head and looked at the sky of Dao Xuan’s eternal night, mumbling in a voice only he could hear.

Three days had passed.

A huge vortex suddenly appeared in the sky above the entire Eight Desolates Beast Domain. The sky rolled like an ocean.

Then, the sky suddenly collapsed and revealed a huge black hole.

A new internal qi was transmitted from it. It seemed to be the power of god.

Moreover, it was very close to them. Qin Yu only felt his entire body turn cold.

He felt that every pore on his body was under the attention of that internal qi. Everyone felt that there was a cold eye watching them from behind.

Suddenly, a consciousness kept shouting in Qin Yu’s mind, tempting him to walk towards the wormhole.

When Qin Yu regained his senses, he had already taken a few steps into the sky. His forehead was covered in cold sweat.

This thing could bewitch people!

As the vortex appeared, many humans slowly walked into the mountains of the Eight Desolates Beast Domain.

One, two, three…

One thousand, ten thousand…

One figure after another slowly climbed to the top of the mountain, allowing the vortex in the sky to suck them in.

However, none of them struggled. This was their choice.

As these humans continued to enter, the sky was dyed with a layer of blood-red energy light.

Nearly 30 ‘kings’ slowly floated from the Eight Desolates Beast Domain, greedily absorbing the energy.

Wave after wave of abnormal energy fluctuations rose from their bodies.

“Their peak power is getting stronger.”

Leng Yuanxun said solemnly.

The peak power needed to accumulate over a long period before it could gradually become stronger.

This process was almost impossible to reverse.

Even the top geniuses could not cross the accumulated time of awakening the peak power to become a Holy Consciousness. But at this moment, the scene in front of them had affected their understanding.

It seemed to be the power of god. That power made almost everyone feel how small they were.

The blood-red sky covered the entire Eight Desolates Beast Domain. All kinds of powerful energy exploded under the sky.

It was because of this energy that the monster race had broken through. The powerful energy filled the entire space of the alien races.

A dense crowd of monster races soared into the sky. They respectfully bowed to the wormhole.

Then, the number of magical beasts that had awakened their peak power had increased by nearly twenty.

Drops of blood fell from the sky.
