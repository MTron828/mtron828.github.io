Chapter 2598: The General Makes a Move

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

However, destroying such a powerful clone would definitely affect Yin Lin.

Qin Yu sneered. He pulled the bow again and shot at the ogre that Ju Wuwei was facing.

This time, he pulled the bow to 40%. After this arrow, the ogre was still breathing.

Ju Wuwei followed up with a slash and killed it thoroughly.

After killing the ogre, both of them tacitly stopped attacking.

However, this silence did not last long. Qin Yu heard the dry and monotonous chanting of incantation from beneath the city.

“Be careful. That necromancer seems to be casting a spell again.”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

The number of fireballs just now had already killed 50 people in the commando team. He did not know what kind of technique would appear this time.

In the darkness, obscure fluctuations kept spreading, and an enormous altar suddenly appeared in the sky far away.

As he chanted the incantation, the altar became increasingly clearer.

“Whoosh!”

Suddenly, a deep azure flame ignited on the altar.

The necromancer below the city raised his pale palm, his fingertips emitting an icy internal qi.

Under his touch, the air seemed to freeze, and a chill spread.

His eyes flashed with a gloomy light, revealing a dark power contrary to life.

At this moment, the altar let out a shrill cry, and the incantation chanting stopped.

Countless gloomy light spots shot out from the altar. These spots seemed to be droplets, one by one.

When these light spots entered Qin Yu’s soul, he saw a soul-like skeleton thingy.

The skeleton grabbed at Qin Yu’s soul, and in an instant, an intense pain and a suffocating feeling spread out from Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

The Hand of Spirit.

It was a technique that directly targeted the soul. Almost everyone let out painful howls.

Some soldiers even broke down right away. They grabbed their knives and stabbed them on their heads.

The skeleton grabbed the golden figurine indifferently, which had no power to oppose.

Blood gushed out of his eyes, nose, and mouth.

“Strengthen the soul!”

Qin Yu did not hesitate to strengthen his soul with all the remaining Saint power.

However, what despaired him was that the altar seemed to be alive.

Green rain continued falling from the altar and into the bodies of those alive.

The power of the skeletal soul in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness grew increasingly more robust. Cracks appeared on the body of Qin Yu’s golden figurine, accompanied by intensified intense pain.

Qin Yu could endure such pain, but the power of the spirit was overwhelming for his soul. If he persisted, the spirit’s hand would completely crush his soul.

A crisp sound of footsteps suddenly appeared on the city wall.

A general in armor held a sharp blade that flickered with a cold light. He stood tall and majestic with taut and muscular contours.

He landed on top of the city wall and leaped up.

The saber in his hand instantly slashed out when he approached the altar.

A loud unsheathing sound echoed across the city wall. The general’s sharp blade streaked across the night sky like a meteor, slashing toward the altar with an aura of destruction.

The moment the saber light clashed with the altar, a dazzling light exploded, illuminating the entire scene.

With a loud bang, the altar was split into halves by the general’s slash. The power of darkness gushed out violently, turning into pitch-black smoke that swept into the void.

The sharp blade in the general’s hand drew a gorgeous and sharp arc in the air, perfectly completing the action of slashing the altar.

His body landed on the ground, his long hair fluttering in the wind, and his chest heaved up and down as he stared at the destroyed altar.

The altar was destroyed, and the green rain no longer fell. The spirit that grabbed Qin Yu’s body soon lost its strength and dissipated from Qin Yu’s soul.

He collapsed on the ground, his body devoid of any strength to even get up.

At this moment, almost everyone, including him, was in a similar state.

Without obstruction, many ogres appeared on the city walls.

The general killed all the ogres with a saber. He stood on the city wall with the saber in one hand.

He laughed frantically at the monster race army beneath.

“Kill them!”

“Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!”

“Protect the family! Slaughter the demon! Kill! Kill! Kill!”

Beneath the city wall, countless human race soldiers roared frantically.

Nearly a thousand human race soldiers were divided into several formations. They slightly bent their backs and prepared themselves.

As the drawbridge was lowered, they charged into the monster race army, causing the monster race army attacking the city to become restless. The 1,000 human race soldiers charged into the ogre army like blades.

“Lu Liefeng! Lu Liefeng!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Feng, Feng, Feng!”

Along the way, they killed countless ogres and stinky blood flowed on the ground.

However, soon, more ogres surrounded them, digging an opening with all their might.

Their strength had slowed down, and a large number of human race soldiers died every second.

Qin Yu walked up the city wall for the first time.

Although he knew they were living beings derived from this Saint Kingdom, they were still shocked to see these 1,000 human race soldiers or so charging into the monster race army just like that.

They knew they would not be able to return, and many of them had white cloth tied around their hands.

However, they did not have the slightest intention of retreating. Qin Yu did not see anyone turn around.

“They are getting increasingly stronger. If we attack again, they will become even more outrageous. Seifer has been testing us. He’s strong but very timid.”

Lu Liefeng’s face was slightly pale. The price he paid to kill the altar was not small.

‘Your name is Qin Yu? You just killed five ogres. Not bad.” He patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and turned to leave.

A shrill voice sounded from the monster race army beneath.

As if they had received some messages, they stopped attacking the city and slowly retreated.

Only then did Qin Yu heave a sigh of relief. At this moment, endless fatigue surged into his head. It was the fatigue of his body, and even Saint power could not lessen it.

It had been twelve hours since he had entered the battlefield.

“What do you think?”

Ju Wuwei came to Qin Yu’s side and sat down. He carefully placed the saber on his thigh.

“We have been rushed to this city, so we shouldn’t be able to leave so easily. It means that we are tied to the survival of this castle. If Lu Liefeng is the strongest general here, I’m afraid what awaits us is death.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly. This necromancer, Seifer, was like a god, not someone they could deal with.

Previously, he had almost killed him with just a glance. Here, its area-of-effect techniques were even more unlikely to deal with.

Who could fight against such an opponent?

“A very powerful saber. This world seems to be more interesting than I’ve thought. ”

On the other hand, Ju Wuwei blurted out a sentence without much thought..
