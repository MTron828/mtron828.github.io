Chapter 848: Chapter 848, breakthrough in seclusion

Zheng Ke strode towards Qin Yu!

He knew very well that in such a moment of seclusion, one would be extremely weak. Even a top-notch martial artist would not be able to escape this law!

Zheng Ke held the radiance in his hand and ruthlessly stabbed towards Qin Yu’s glabella!

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes!

He quickly reached out and grabbed Zheng Ke’s wrist!

That radiance was only one centimeter away from Qin Yu’s glabella!

“You’re quite ruthless.”Qin Yu glanced at him and said coldly.

“You want to pierce through my spiritual sense?”

Zheng Ke’s expression immediately changed! He exclaimed, “Aren’t... aren’t you in seclusion?”

“Seclusion?”Qin Yu raised his brows.

“Do you really think I’ll believe you?”

Zheng Ke instantly felt a sense of danger!

This Qin Yu was actually lying to him!

Qin Yu grabbed Zheng Ke’s hand with increasing strength.

Zheng Ke only felt as if his wrist was about to be crushed. The intense pain made his forehead break out in cold sweat!

Qin Yu stood up from the bed. He looked at Zheng Ke coldly and said, “The people of your Hong family are indeed not worthy of being trusted.”

Zheng Ke was already panicking. He hurriedly begged for mercy, “Qin Yu, i. . . I was just possessed for a moment. You... If you spare me, I guarantee that there won’t be a next time!”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and sneered, “Once disloyal, you won’t use it for the rest of your life. Don’t you know this principle?”

Sensing the killing intent emitted from Qin Yu’s body, Zheng Ke became even more terrified.

He said anxiously, “Qin Yu! I have more than 3,000 secret keys in my hands. If you want to explore the mystic realm, you must need me!”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “That’s right. I do need you, but I don’t necessarily need you.”

“Keeping you is like keeping a time bomb, so... you’d better go to Hell!”

After saying that, Qin Yu suddenly exerted strength in his hand and directly crushed Zheng Ke’s wrist!

Zheng Ke couldn’t care less about the pain and immediately ran away.

But how could his speed be compared to Qin Yu’s?

Before he could escape, a huge golden hand had already blotted out the sky and covered the earth!

“Pa!”

That huge palm fiercely fell down and directly smashed Zheng Ke into meat paste!

Qin Yu slowly walked in front of Zheng Ke and took out the golden core in his body.

“Another golden core,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Then, Qin Yu took Zheng Ke’s body and walked out of the room.

Su Qian happened to walk toward him outside the room.

Seeing this scene, Su Qian couldn’t help but be slightly surprised.

“What... What’s going on?”Su Qian exclaimed.

Qin Yu threw Zheng Ke’s body to the side and said, “He wanted to kill me, but I killed him. Take care of the body.”

After saying that, Qin Yu turned around and left.

When he reached the door, Qin Yu stopped.

“Su Qian, I hope you don’t make the same mistake as Zheng Ke,”Qin Yu warned.

Su Qian didn’t dare to say anything and only nodded carefully.

After returning to his room, Qin Yu adjusted his internal Qi slightly.

“It’s time to try to break through,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

This breakthrough was a long process, and he didn’t know how long it would take. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

He took out the golden core and the ten-thousand-year-old herbs from the spatial divine tool and prepared to try and break through.

Then, Qin Yu didn’t waste any more time. He refined the ten-thousand-year-old herbs into a pill in the fastest time possible and then swallowed it.

Wisps of light brewed in his body.

The dense qi/spiritual energy formed a small whirlpool around Qin Yu’s golden pill.

The Golden Pill slowly rotated in Qin Yu’s Dantian, slowly absorbing the Qi/spiritual energy from the pill.

Time passed by minute by second. In the blink of an eye, three days had passed, but Qin Yu still showed no signs of coming out of seclusion.

At this time, the outside world was also calculating the time of Qin Yu’s martial saint power.

“According to my prediction, Qin Yu’s martial saint’s power seems to only have three days left, right?”Gu Xinghe said lightly.

The two old men beside him quickly nodded and said, “Young master, it is indeed three days.”

Gu Xinghe sneered and said, “It is also time to make a move on Qin Yu. Kill him and take Yan Ruoxue away.”

“Young master doesn’t need to make a move on such a small matter. The two of US can take his life,”the old man said.

Gu Xinghe shook his head and said, “No, I want to kill him myself!”

“Young master, this doesn’t seem appropriate,”one of the old men said.

“If anything happens, we won’t be able to answer to the master.”

“Besides... if he uses you as a hostage to threaten the master, the gains won’t make up for the losses.”

Gu Xinghe seemed to think it made sense.

He touched his chin and said in a low voice, “I’ve investigated Qin Yu’s information these few days. This person is indeed quite dangerous...”

“Elder Qian he and elder Qian he, I’ll leave the matter of Qin Yu to you for now.”

The two elders called Elder Qian he and elder Qian he stood up and said, “Young master, actually, we have a better choice.”

“Oh?”Gu Xinghe raised his eyebrows.

The Qianhe elders smiled faintly and said, “The JINGDU martial arts association is not the only one who wants Yan Ruoxue. All the major forces are also keeping an eye on Qin Yu.”

“It’s better to spread the news and let them take action. When that time comes, we will reap the benefits.”

Gu Xinghe raised his eyebrows and said with some amusement, “That makes sense... Our Jingdu martial arts association can’t do everything by ourselves. That would be too demeaning.”

A superior force relied on manipulating others.

Gu Xinghe was well-versed in this principle.

“Go Check Qin Yu’s location in advance and spread the news,”Gu Xinghe said coldly.

“Yes, Young Master.”Qian he and Qian he immediately nodded, then turned around and walked out of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

They didn’t waste any time and immediately launched an investigation.

The power controlled by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association was extremely powerful. Not only did they have martial arts power, but they also had powerful connections.

Thus, they quickly found out about Qin Yu’s actions.

Even Qin Yu’s participation in the exchange meet did not escape their eyes.

Other than the JINGDU martial arts association, other hidden forces also began to investigate Qin Yu’s actions.

These forces were extremely complicated, and Qin Yu had never even seen them before.

Enemies hiding in the shadows were often the most terrifying.
