Chapter 768: The Terrifying Guardian! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse inwardly.

In front of the Guardians, this Martial Saint weapon was probably useless.

“Granny Qin actually brought a Martial Saint weapon!”

“Looks like she’s determined to get rid of Qin Yu!”

“I wonder what these two corpses that flew out of Qin Yu’s body are for.”

The crowd discussed animatedly. Clearly, they hadn’t realized the current dangerous situation.

Although Qin Yu was anxious, he couldn’t do anything about it.

Granny Qin held the Martial Saint’s weapon in her hand. She looked at the Guardians coldly and shouted, “Today, I will smash these two corpses!”

Accompanied by an angry shout, Granny Qin activated the Martial Saint’s weapon in her hand and dashed towards the Guardians!

The Guardians’ expression was ice-cold.

Facing Granny Qin, who was dashing towards him, the Guardians only raised his head and looked over with a fierce gaze.

“Crack!”

It was just a single gaze! The Martial Saint weapon in Granny Qin’s hand was actually shattered! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Granny Qin’s body was sent flying!

Half of her body was directly smashed into minced meat, and only half of her body remained!

“Ah...” Granny Qin let out a painful wail from her mouth.

“How... how could this be...” She looked at the shattered Martial Saint’s weapon, and her eyes were filled with terror.

In the next second, Granny Qin fainted.

The scene was silent.

Everyone gasped!

They didn’t even know what had happened! They only knew that the Martial Saint weapon had suddenly shattered, and Granny Qin had suddenly flown out!

“What... What happened...”

“Those two people... What did they do? Why did the Martial Saint weapon shatter, and Granny Qin flew out...”

“No... I don’t know...”

“Granny Qin!”

At this moment, Blackie suddenly let out an angry roar!

“I’m going to kill you!” Blackie let out an angry roar. He unleashed all the power in his body and charged towards the Guardians!

The power of a Martial Saint was unleashed to the extreme at this moment. Clearly, Blackie was extremely furious at this moment!

Facing Blackie, who was charging towards them, the Guardians finally made their move.

One of them slowly raised his finger and flicked it gently.

“Boom!”

Blackie was sent flying! His incomparably fierce body was instantly shattered!

In the next second, Blackie lost his human form and returned to his original form. He fell heavily to the ground!

“Ah...” Blackie spat out a mouthful of blood. Then, following Granny Qin’s footsteps, he fell unconscious.

“What... What’s going on...” when everyone saw this scene, they finally felt afraid!

“Blackie, who possessed the power of a Martial Saint, was sent flying by a finger...”

“What the hell is that thing...”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and couldn’t help but curse, “A bunch of idiots. Why aren’t they running? Are they waiting to die here?”

Only after Qin Yu reminded them did they react!

“Run!” Someone shouted and ran away!

Yan Jinyao also realized that something was wrong, and his expression turned extremely ugly.

“These two corpses probably don’t belong to this era. Retreat!” Yan Jinyao said coldly.

Everyone scattered like birds and beasts, and the Guardians also sensed them at this moment.

The two of them raised their palms and squeezed lightly.

The space in front of everyone instantly distorted!

Everyone’s path of escape was immediately blocked!

“They raised their hands and distorted the space. What... What exactly are these people...” Qin Yu’s expression was extremely unsightly!

This time, the Guardians’s awakening seemed to be even more powerful than the previous one!

“Oh no, these two people aren’t the people of the present. If we let them live, it will definitely be a disaster!” The man with the mustache revealed a grave expression.

Qin Yu walked over and frowned. “What should we do now? Quickly think of a way!”

The man with the mustache said coldly, “If we let them do whatever they want, the present society will definitely be destroyed!”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said, “Don’t you have many ways? Quickly think of a way! Otherwise, I’m afraid I’ll become a sinner!”

The man with the mustache couldn’t help but curse, “What the f * ck can I do? Can’t you see how powerful they are! Back then, I told you not to bring them out, but you didn’t listen. Now, it’s over!”

A trace of guilt flashed across Qin Yu’s face.

No one had expected these two corpses to suddenly revive!

“It must be because of that picture.” Qin Yu suddenly thought of something!

“It must be because we used that picture that caused these two Guardians to revive!”

The man with the mustache also nodded and said, “That’s right. It’s easy to invite them in, but difficult to send them out. If we want to get rid of them now, I’m afraid it’ll be troublesome.”

“Damn it, I’ll fight it out with you!”

In the crowd, some person seemed to be unable to withstand the fear and actually charged towards the Guardians!

“You’re f* cking crazy!” Seeing this, Qin Yu instantly became anxious!

This was undoubtedly infuriating the Guardians!

Once the Guardians was enraged, everyone present would die!

Facing the person who charged over, the Guardians didn’t even look at him before he directly turned him into meat paste.

Just as Qin Yu had guessed, this action had completely infuriated the Guardians.

A terrifying killing intent emanated from their bodies!

The killing intent permeated the entire Qinggang Mountain, sending chills down people’s spines!

“Pu!”

Someone couldn’t withstand this killing intent and was directly blasted into a bloody mist!

Even Qin Yu, Yan Jinyao, the man with the mustache, and the others felt waves of discomfort.

“We have to think of a way!” Qin Yu said anxiously.

The man with the mustache gritted his teeth and said, “Use that picture to try again!”

Qin Yu hurriedly threw the picture to the Guardians.

Looking at the picture flying over, the Guardians clearly showed a hint of absent-mindedness.

But in just half a second, they returned to normal.

“It’s over! It’s useless!” Qin Yu’s expression changed greatly!

“Clothes! Where are the clothes?!” The man with the mustache said anxiously.

Hearing this, Qin Yu hurriedly took out the clothes of the masked woman.

Unfortunately, it still didn’t work.

This time, the Guardians’s consciousness was obviously stronger!

“Oh no!” Qin Yu’s expression was extremely ugly!

If this continued, not only would everyone here die, the entire world would probably face a disaster!

The murderous intent on the Guardians’ body became more and more intense.

They swept their gazes across everyone, as if they were looking at a bunch of ants and plants, without the slightest bit of emotion.

Finally, the Guardians moved.

Their gray eyes swept across everyone, as if they were sentencing everyone to death.

However, when their gazes landed on Xiao Yu, they paused.

Their pupils flashed with a strong sense of fear! Their bodies were trembling fiercely!
