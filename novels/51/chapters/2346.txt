2347 Ji Yue’s Interest

Wang Feng nodded and had just found out Qin Yu had obtained a vast amount of spiritual essence.

Some terrifying formations would consume tremendous spiritual energy each time they were activated.

For example, the Immortal Eradication Formation had to accumulate energy for a hundred years before it could be used again.

“Ji Yue, I have something to tell you.”

Qin Yu turned his head to look at Ji Yue, and Sumeru qi enveloped Ji Yue. The two entered the Sumeru ring together.

“These are all things from your Jee family’s ancestral space. I’ve already absorbed all the vital energy from dozens of spiritual energy Mystic Realms. These things should be returned to you, and you should leave a portion of your spiritual essence stones for Wang Feng to set up the formation.”

Qin Yu handed everything to Ji Yue, though these things made him drool.

However, the spiritual energy in dozens of spaces had sufficiently benefited him, and taking these things away would make him feel like taking advantage of others.

Ji Yue glanced deeply at Qin Yu, then suddenly broke into a smile.

“Qin Yu, I didn’t misjudge you. I’ve been to the ancestor’s space, and you really didn’t take anything. Are you a fool? I can’t resist even if you forcefully take these things away.”

“I’ve already obtained enough benefits, and I’m afraid I can’t achieve the current progress of my holy body without a few decades, even if I cultivate in the ninth level of purgatory.”

Qin Yu could plunder these things mercilessly if Ji Yue were an enemy.

However, Ji Yue treated him as a friend, so he could not afford to have such an attitude. Everyone had their own faith in their hearts.

Ji Yue did not see a trace of greed in Qin Yu’s eyes.

What she said was true. Even if Qin Yu forcefully snatched them away, she could not stop him at all.

“I’ll take these, and you can have the rest.”

Ji Yue took a few bottles of Spirit-gathering Pill and Heavenly Deity Pill.

“These things are only harmful to me at the moment. Moreover, with the talents of the Ji family members, they indeed don’t need these things.”

Seeing Qin Yu’s puzzled expression, Ji Yue explained quietly.

“Turbulent times are approaching, and your Glazed Holy Body isn’t complete yet. These resources are static, and their true significance lies in your ability to transform them into your own strength. Only then can I seek support from you. Just don’t take my Jee family’s resources and turn around to offer them to someone else.”

“Of course, if you feel bad, I’ll collect some interest from you.”

“F*ck, this is insane!”

Qin Yu was shocked, and his face turned red.

“Hahaha!”

Seeing Qin Yu’s reaction like a virgin, Ji Yue laughed so hard that she trembled.

After returning from the Sumeru ring, the two reappeared in the main hall.

Now that the Sumeru ring had absorbed a vast amount of Sumeru qi, even if Qin Yu entered the Sumeru ring, the ring could shuttle through space without being discovered by others. He no longer had to worry about the ring being destroyed by external forces.

With a thought, Qin Yu fully unfolded the Green Spirit Tree at a spot in the Azure Firmament Sect.

He already plucked the fruit from the tree. But this Green Spirit Tree seemed to have already evolved. There was a qualitative improvement regardless of the speed of absorbing spiritual energy or its body size.

Most importantly, the Green Spirit Tree had also absorbed enormous spiritual energy in the Jee family’s Mystic Realm. At this moment, its body was full of spiritual energy.

The moment the Green Spirit Tree appeared, it emitted misty spiritual energy. The dense spiritual energy made everyone involuntarily mentally rejuvenated.

The Green Spirit Tree’s roots completely unfolded, piercing into all the planes nearby and absorbing a vast amount of spiritual energy.

“Everyone, seize the time and start cultivating. The turbulent times are approaching. Every increase in strength will increase your chances of survival in the future.”

Qin Yu said to the people gathered in a deep voice.

Next, he wanted to gather forces of the Azure Firmament Sect and the Ji family and build a fortress for protection here.

Under the Green Spirit Tree’s assistance, these people’s cultivation would be much faster than the others.

Wang Feng had already begun to set up the formation. With Wang Feng’s attainments in formations and the vast amount of spiritual essence, he could even set up formation more terrifying than that of Solitary Cloud City.

Even the people of the Holy Region could not gain any advantage.

“Sigh, if only I had the man with the mustache.”

Qin Yu sighed softly. This old fellow, the man with the mustache, was skilled in all sorts of strange secret techniques. His attainments in formations were much more formidable than Wang Feng’s. If he were here, this place could be forged into an indestructible fortress.

“Jue Wu, you and Elder Guai will stay in Azure Firmament Sect for now. I will continue to condense and cultivate the Glazed Holy Body. If people from the Holy Region come, I’m afraid they can’t resist.”

Qin Yu was still a little worried. Although the probability of the Holy Region attacking was not high, they still had to take precautions.

On his side, Jue Wu and Elder Guai had the highest cultivation. With these two people watching over them, he could go into seclusion without worry.

“Heavenly Deity Pill! Is it the pill to recover the power of the soul made from the nascent soul of the tribulation cultivators?”

“That’s right. It’s a gift from Ji Yue.”

“Keep this for yourself. It will be of great use. Even if your soul is injured, you’ll completely recover with just one of these pills. It can be of great use in life and death situations.”

Elder Guai gasped and waved his hands repeatedly, wanting to refuse.

Qin Yu’s heart was filled with warmth. Elder Guai was indeed concerned about him like an elder, considering everything for him.

This included giving Qin Yu the hardest locust tree shield and the Sumeru ring. He had only considered Qin Yu’s needs.

“Elder Guai, when your strength recovers soon, you can also protect me when the time comes!”

Qin Yu directly stuffed it into Elder Guai’s hands, not giving him a chance to reject it.

Qin Yu was just about to stuff a few bottles of pills into Jue Wu when she pushed them away. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“I don’t need these things. Just eat more meat.” Jue Wu patted her chest.

Suddenly, her expression changed as if she had noticed something.

D*mn it, you beast!”

She directly punched Qin Yu’s face, almost crooked his nose.

Following that, it was another kick with the knee, making Qin Yu’s entire body bend like a shrimp.

“F*ck, what are you doing?” Qin Yu was beaten until his speech became unclear.

After beating Qin Yu, Jue Wu left with a displeased expression.

“Brother, there’s a red lip mark on your face. Is Auntie Jue Wu jealous?”

Xiaoru climbed onto Qin Yu’s shoulder and poked Qin Yu’s face with a smile.
