Chapter 285: Qin Yu’s Father Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

As expected! Gu Taichu was connected to his father!

Qin Yu instantly became somewhat emotional.

Even his internal qi began to fluctuate.

Gu Taichu seemed to have noticed Qin Yu’s emotional fluctuation. He walked to a rock and sat down. Then, he said slowly, “It seems that you don’t know your father very well.”

Qin Yu took a step forward and said anxiously, “Master Gu, what is your relationship with my father? And who is my father?”

Gu Taichu looked at the sky and said slowly, “I don’t know your father very well, but I know that he is a man of great power.”

“Back then, I was just an ordinary Inner Strength Master Hands. I was the weakest among my peers.”

“Later, I met your father by chance. It was your father who blessed me with my powers.”

Qin Yu was a little confused.

His father blessed him with his powers?

He made someone the weakest in his generation become a famous martial artist in the Jiang Bei Region?

What kind of method did he use?

Qin Yu’s eyes were filled with anticipation and nervousness as he waited for Gu Taichu to continue.

Gu Taichu continued, “Back then, he suppressed his strength to the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm and fought with me once.”

Updates by

Qin Yu was instantly stunned.

No wonder Gu Taichu wanted to forcefully suppress his strength to the Inner Strength Master Hands realm! So it turned out that his father had also taught Gu Taichu like this back then!

“What happened in the end?” Qin Yu asked.

Gu Taichu smiled bitterly and said, “He only raised his hand and I fainted.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but gasp.

In the same realm, his father could actually achieve such a level of suppression!

Even Qin Yu, who was a chaotic body, couldn’t do it at all!

“Of course, at that time, I didn’t know any spells, so I couldn’t compare with you.” Gu Taichu sighed.

“If you and I are really on the same level, perhaps you can do the same.” Gu Taichu said with a smile.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything, but he agreed with him inside.

Not to mention the same level, Qin Yu didn’t even take Inner Strength Past Masters seriously.

“Master Gu, can you tell me what kind of person my father is? Is he still alive? What kind of person is my mother? Why have they never come to see me?” Qin Yu asked several questions in one breath.

Gu Taichu didn’t seem to know the answer.

He thought for a moment and said, “I’ve only been in contact with your father for three days, so I don’t know much about him.”

“But I know that his ability is perhaps not something we can understand.”

“As for where he went, no one knows. But I believe that I’m not the only one who has been blessed by him.”

Qin Yu was even more shocked.

Qin Yu was even more eager to know everything about his father.

“Oh right.” Speaking up to this point, Gu Taichu suddenly thought of something.

“Your father once left me ten pieces of Enlightenment Tea. He said that seven pieces belong to me and three pieces belong to you,” Gu Taichu said.

“Enlightenment Tea?” Qin Yu was unfamiliar with this term.

Gu Taichu nodded and said, “Ever since I took the Enlightenment Tea, my strength has increased by leaps and bounds in a short period of time. From the Inner Strength Master Hands realm, I have become an Inner Strength Grandmaster.”

Qin Yu immediately gasped!

To be able to help one advance so many levels in a row, the Enlightenment Tea was practically a holy object!

With the Enlightenment Tea, wouldn’t Qin Yu be able to directly step into the Monastic Stage or even higher?

In that case, Qin Yu would have the ability to head to Jingdu!

“Master Gu, where is the Enlightenment Tea?” Qin Yu asked anxiously.

Gu Taichu shook his head and said, “Before seeing you again, I wasn’t sure if you were his descendant, so I didn’t bring the Enlightenment Tea with me.”

“So... the Enlightenment Tea was placed in Jiang Bei?” Qin Yu hurriedly asked.

Gu Taichu slowly stood up and smiled. “That’s right. If you’re willing, you can follow me to get it.”

“I’m willing, of course I’m willing!” Qin Yu hurriedly nodded.

So his father had once left behind such a holy item!

Gu Taichu stood up from the rock. He put his hands behind his back and said slowly, “Alright, get ready. We’ll set off tomorrow.”

After saying this, Gu Taichu turned around and left.

His speed was extremely fast. In the blink of an eye, he disappeared in front of Qin Yu.

Meanwhile, Qin Yu was sitting in the courtyard and couldn’t calm down for a long time.

Qin Yu was even more curious about his father.

What kind of person was he exactly? How was he compared to Ye Qing? Why was there no legend of him in the world?

And who was his mother?

Countless thoughts burst in Qin Yu’s mind.

He sat cross-legged on the ground and circulated his internal qi to flow through his meridians.

After circulating it three times, Qin Yu finally calmed down slightly.

He stood up from the ground and looked at the sky while recalling the scene when he fought with Gu Taichu.

After this battle, Qin Yu clearly discovered his weakness.

Although his physical strength was strong enough, once he met someone like Gu Taichu, who was extremely fast, the advantage of his physical body would be insignificant. He might even become a moving target.

‘I have to think of a countermeasure,’ Qin Yu thought to himself.

He returned to his room and began to search for the technique in the inheritance.

Outside the door, the unconscious reporters also woke up.

They looked at the scene in the courtyard and couldn’t help but feel a little confused.

“Where are they? Where are they?”

“What happened to us? Did we suddenly fall asleep?”

“From the situation in the courtyard, the two of them have probably already fought.”

After thinking about it for a while, they decided to interview Qin Yu.

The leader was a female reporter who had just graduated from university. She was wearing a professional outfit, which outlined her extremely sexy figure.

The female reporter led a few people and pushed open the door.

As soon as the door opened, Qin Yu’s eyes suddenly opened.

“Who let you in?” Qin Yu asked coldly.

The female reporter walked forward quickly and said politely, “Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Qin. We are reporters from the Jiang Bei Martial Arts Association. We have a question to ask you.”

Qin Yu glanced at her and said, “I’m sorry, I don’t have time.”

The female reporter said somewhat awkwardly, “Mr. Qin, we don’t mean any harm. It’s just that...”

“I told you, I don’t have time,” Qin Yu interrupted the female reporter.

The female reporter had no choice but to leave.

Qin Yu waved his hand and closed the door.

At night, Yao Qing also came back from outside.

He sat beside Qin Yu and said, “Mr. Qin, I went out for a walk today and gained a lot.”

“With the breathing exercise you taught me, my progress is astonishing!”

Qin Yu glanced at Yao Qing. As expected, Yao Qing had already stepped into the peak of Inner Strength Master Hands.

This speed was very fast.

“Mr. Qin, I will take you there tomorrow. The spiritual energy there is extremely abundant!” Yao Qing said excitedly.

This surprised Qin Yu a little. He was about to speak when there was a knock on the door.

After Yao Qing opened the door, he saw a girl wearing a business suit.

This girl was none other than the female reporter. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Is Qin Yu at home?” The female reporter asked in a low voice.

Yao Qing quickly shouted into the room, “Mr. Qin, a girl with big breasts is looking for you!”
