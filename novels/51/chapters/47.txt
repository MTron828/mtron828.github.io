Chapter 48: Yan Ruoxue’s Transformation Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Upon hearing Qin Yu’s words, Lei Hu was clearly a little disappointed.

He wanted to rely on this Soul Nourishment Pill to transform himself. If he were to give it to another partner, then his advantage would no longer exist.

Although he thought so deep down, Lei Hu didn’t say anything and only nodded his head in agreement.

Qin Yu saw through Lei Hu’s thoughts and smiled while saying, “Don’t worry, the overall authority of the Soul Nourishment Pill will always be in your hands.”

When Lei Hu heard this, he was immediately overjoyed and hurriedly nodded while saying, “Thank you, Mr. Qin!”

Lei Hu quickly spread the news.

For a while, everyone in Jiangcheng was discussing this matter.

...

At the Yan family manor, the usually aloof Yan Ruoxue actually wore an apron today and hummed a song as she happily busied herself in the kitchen.

“Miss, you should rest quickly...” There were countless people surrounding her. They, afraid that Yan Ruoxue would accidentally hurt herself, had anxious expressions on their faces.

The secretary smiled bitterly and said, “Miss, how can you do such a menial task? Just let us servants do it...”

Yan Ruoxue didn’t care at all. This was the first time she realized that cooking was so fun!

Because Qin Yu was coming to eat tonight, Yan Ruoxue personally cooked.

At night, Yan Ruoxue meticulously decorated the room with dim lights, a table full of delicious food, and a bottle of 1982 red wine.

All the servants were chased out by Yan Ruoxue. In the huge room, only Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue were left.

“These were all made by you?” Qin Yu couldn’t believe it.

How could a rich heiress like Yan Ruoxue be so dexterous?

“Quick, try it and see how it tastes!” Yan Ruoxue said with some anticipation.

Qin Yu hurriedly picked up his chopsticks and started eating.

Just after the first bite, Qin Yu grimaced.

This was too d*mn disgusting!

“Is it good?” Yan Ruoxue blinked her eyes and asked excitedly.

Looking at Yan Ruoxue’s expectant expression, Qin Yu really couldn’t bear to hurt her feelings, so he braced himself and said, “It’s... delicious, extremely delicious...”

“Really?!” The usually aloof ice queen was as excited as a little girl!

“Really!” Qin Yu nodded vigorously.

“Then eat more!” Yan Ruoxue said with a smile.

Qin Yu felt as if he had shot himself in the foot.

After finishing the meal with great difficulty, Qin Yu, along with Yan Ruoxue, walked around the manor while admiring the night scenery. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Smelling the faint fragrance on Yan Ruoxue’s body, Qin Yu felt a little titillated.

He secretly glanced at Yan Ruoxue’s side profile and his heart skipped a beat.

Qin Yu, wanting to hold Yan Ruoxue’s hand, mustered up his courage and carefully reached out his hand.

At this moment, Yan Ruoxue suddenly said, “Qin Yu.”

Qin Yu was so startled that he trembled and hurriedly withdrew his hand.

“Huh, what’s wrong?” Qin Yu asked.

Yan Ruoxue looked at the sky and said, “Do you like this kind of life?”

Qin Yu was stunned and didn’t understand Yan Ruoxue’s words.

“This kind of life... What kind of life is it?” Qin Yu asked in puzzlement.

Yan Ruoxue smiled and said, “Have you been tired recently?”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said with a bitter smile, “A little.”

Indeed, Qin Yu’s life had been very tiring recently and he barely had time to rest.

Yan Ruoxue smiled and said, “Why don’t I take care of you?”

Qin Yu was stunned. He shook his head and said, “Why did you say that all of a sudden?”

Yan Ruoxue said, “If you don’t like this kind of life, I can take care of you.”

Qin Yu thought that Yan Ruoxue was joking, so he replied with a smile, “Then I’ll be a gigolo. How can I buy a wedding ring and hold a wedding in that case?”

Yan Ruoxue looked at Qin Yu seriously and said, “A wedding ring doesn’t necessarily have to be bought by a man, and the wedding doesn’t necessarily have to be held by you. If you are willing, I’ll buy the wedding ring, and I’ll hold the wedding.”

Hearing Yan Ruoxue’s words, Qin Yu was instantly stunned.

He turned to look at Yan Ruoxue and said seriously and firmly, “Although I have been a little tired recently, I’m very fulfilled.”

“Before I met you, I was like a walking zombie without any goals in life.”

“Since I met you, my life has gained meaning and I have a goal to strive towards.”

At this point, Qin Yu took a deep breath and continued saying, “Miss Yan, give me one year, at most one year.”

“One year later, I’ll go to the Yan family to propose marriage and give you a grand wedding.”

The atmosphere became a little amorous.

With these vows, the two of them seemed to have returned to their youth.

However, Qin Yu’s words touched Yan Ruoxue slightly.

“Okay.” Yan Ruoxue smiled.

“One year later, I will wait for you to give me a grand wedding.”

After Qin Yu left, Yan Ruoxue sat in the courtyard for a long time.

The secretary couldn’t help but walk forward and sigh while saying, “Miss, I feel that you have changed.”

Yan Ruoxue glanced at him and smiled while saying, “How have I changed?”

The secretary smiled bitterly and said, “Before coming to Jiangcheng, we have always admired your shrewdness and your decisiveness.”

“You also said that if Qin Yu was a good-for-nothing, you would leave Jiangcheng and cancel this engagement.”

“But now... you don’t seem to care whether Qin Yu has achieved anything. It’s like... It’s like you’ve turned from a rational and shrewd ice queen to a down-to-earth girl next door...”

Yan Ruoxue smiled and didn’t comment.

Just as the secretary said, Yan Ruoxue didn’t really care about whether or not Qin Yu made a name for himself.

“I will respect Qin Yu’s choice.” Yan Ruoxue smiled.

“If he doesn’t want to strive anymore, I’ll take care of him.”

“If he wants to make a name for himself, then I’ll do my best to help him.”

Obviously, Qin Yu chose the latter.
