Chapter 2766: The Abyss of Misery

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“You’re lucky to be able to survive. Not everyone can provoke the Alester family. I advise you to put away your thoughts, not even a little.”

A one-eyed thin man walked up to Qin Yu. His tone was cold.

This person was a higher-up of Lingxu City. He was furious that he was put in a difficult position by the Alester family because of Qin Yu.

Qin Yu stood up with difficulty.

He was still injured.

“Are you alright?”

Cang Yunzi frowned and asked.

Qin Yu shook his head. His face was a little pale.

With a wave of his sleeve, Cang Yunzi brought Qin Yu away from this place.

“Patriarch, he survived. Do you need me to take further action?”

The old man followed behind Patriarch Ming Alester and Young Lord Kong and bent down slightly.

“Is it?”

The patriarch of the Alester family revealed a surprised expression.

“His Dao of Dreams power seems to have surpassed Young Lord Kong’s cultivation. He quickly broke through my sword intent block.”

“It’s fine. Let him continue to grow. There’s no fun in eating an unripened fruit. ”

Ming laughed softly, but that gentle smile seemed very sinister.

“Furthermore, cultivating the power of the Dao of Dreams has overdrawn all of his future potentials. It’s almost impossible for him to awaken the peak power.

most of the time, this kind of power awakens between lite and death. ‘The power of cultivating the Dao of Dreams has caused his body to lose the ability to break through between life and death.”

“I got it.”

After staying in Cang Yunzi’s house for half a day, Qin Yu’s terrifying injuries finally stabilized.

“They have known your information long ago. That old man’s sword intent is ‘Pain’. It directly lands on the divine soul and is called ‘Pain’. It’s the sword intent cultivated by the slaves of the Alester family. This power is mainly used in criminal law and has a special restraining effect on the Dao of Dreams.” Cang Yunzi said with a bitter smile.

“Yes. When I was about to enter the dream, I felt a pain in my divine soul. The peak power seemed to be especially to injure the divine soul. The pain almost penetrated my bone marrow and pulled me back to reality.”

“This is the terrifying peak power. Although the power of the Dao of Dreams is unpredictable, it can still be restrained.”

“My current state should be at its lowest point. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be like this.”

However, this power was still very much a counter to the power of the Dao of Dreams.

When he was cultivating previously, the power of the night in his body had completely disintegrated by the power of Heavenly Sin.

He had not fully recovered yet.

“Taoist priest, if I were to have a real life-and-death battle with this power one day, how would I resist it?”

Qin Yu hesitated for a moment before asking Cang Yunzi.

“The sword intent Pain is a power that restrains the Dao of Dreams. This restraining relationship will continue to exist unless your Night Qi can transform again and forcefully suppress it as a higher level of power.”

“Can the Night Qi transform?”

Qin Yu frowned and asked.

Ever since he cultivated the Night Qi, this power did not have any changes in its attributes.

“In the previous battle, the power of the Dao of Dreams released by the Extraterritorial Heavenly Devil directly reversed the situation. Everyone was affected by that power. I don’t understand the power, but I think it can be awakened to a stronger level.”

“Taoist priest, I still don’t understand. Is this kind of power considered to be the peak power?”

Qin Yu still did not quite understand the connection between them.

“For example, the power of the Dao of Dreams. This power doesn’t come from anywhere but from the legendary Nineteenth Prison. It has existed since ancient times and can be cultivated to the peak level through various methods. It’s the power of heaven and earth. The peak power starts when you introduce this energy into your body. After a long period of cultivation, your body awakens the most suitable power for you and triggers this power to the greatest extent. The two are not the same concept.”

“This requires you to cultivate the peak power before you can comprehend it more thoroughly.”

Qin Yu only felt that he had vaguely grasped onto something.

After leaving Cang Yunzi’s residence, Qin Yu sighed.

The awakening of the peak power was a top priority for him.

However, the powers he was cultivating were too mixed just like Lord Alester had said. Even he could not tell which was his final power. Therefore, it was even more difficult to awaken the peak power.

In the Endless Mine, Yi Yun was quietly cultivating.

Suddenly, the candle flame in front of him trembled.

He opened his eyes subconsciously.

A black-robed man landed on the ground like a ghost.

He seemed to have no physical body and his clothes swayed gently in the air.

Yi Yun’s eyes narrowed slightly.

This person gave him an extremely dangerous feeling. Moreover, he was so close to him without making a sound. Even the guards nearby did not notice him.

He came with ill intentions.

Void Shattering Finger!

Yi Yun extended his index finger as a condensed fingerprint exploded in front of the black-robed man.

However, it was as if it was absorbed when the explosion landed on his body.

Even his robe did not shake.

“Hah!”

Yi Yun’s expression changed drastically. That finger had condensed eighty percent of his strength.

However, the person in front of him was intact.

Heaven Severing Finger!

He took a deep breath.

His body seemed to have turned into a small vortex almost instantly.

The air around him seemed to become a vacuum and all the holy energy poured into his body.

He pointed his index finger again.

The air vibrated slightly.

As the Heaven Severing Finger appeared, the entire space seemed to be cut off. rlAJ0 huge barriers appeared around the black-robed man.

Then, the finger suddenly pushed out, wanting to turn the black-robed man in the middle into a meat patty.

The entire ground trembled slightly.

There was a faint buzzing sound in the air. The teacups on the table made a cracking sound.

Boom!

The black-robed man walked out of the space as if the spatial barrier did not exist.

“The abyss of misery is boundless. Turn back and be saved.”

He came in front of Yi Yun.

A murmur came from his mouth.

The voice was like a bomb. It constantly reverberated in Yi Yun’s mind.

His expression suddenly froze and his tense body slowly relaxed.

“Let me see your memories. Don’t resist.”

The black-robed person softly said. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

This Dao Realm level 9 couldn’t even last one round against the black-robed man.

Qin Yu, who was cultivating, woke up at this moment. He temporarily restored his Night Qi to its peak state.

This way, he could protect himself even if he encountered danger.

He had to go and meet Wang Da today. He would have to leave Lingxu City if

there was still no news..
