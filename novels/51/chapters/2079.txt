2080 Wu Ji’s Past

Qin Yu opened his eyes hazily. He gazed at this void world, and his eyes suddenly narrowed!

He saw that not far away, a young man in ragged clothes was clenching his fists.

He was not tall enough and was only 14 or 15 years old. His internal qi was incredibly weak, and one could see faint scars on his body. He looked like he had just been bullied, and his frail body looked tremendously pitiful.

However, the determination in the eyes of such a skinny youth was incomparably bright as if it was burning with flames.

The young man silently raised his head and looked at the sky. There was a golden cloud there, like streams of golden river.

On his body, Qin Yu seemed to have already seen an invisible aura. This aura was tremendously moving as if it had already witnessed his future strength.

“This youth… is Wu Ji!” Qin Yu was shocked!

Was the Traceless Immortal Scripture left behind traces of Wu Ji’s dao comprehension and cultivation process?

If that were the case, wouldn’t Qin Yu personally witness the process of Wu Ji’s dao comprehension and cultivation?

“Is it through this method… to obtain the inheritance?” Qin Yu muttered, his eyes filled with indescribable shock. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Soon, the scene changed to another. At this time, Wu Ji had begun to take shape. From the scene, Wu Ji seemed to be in a sect but also seemed to have just undergone some strength test.

There was endless laughter from the surrounding people. Their eyes were full of mockery, and various insulting words continued to be heard.

Several elders were shaking their heads repeatedly In front of him as if they were disappointed by Wu Ji.

Only Wu Ji clenched his fists tightly.

Even though he was surrounded by endless ridicule, he held up his head proudly like a proud swan.

“Wu Ji, although you have a chaotic body, you are not suitable for the cultivation path of this world. You may just give up!” the elderly man said, and the disappointment in his eyes deepened.

But Wu Ji puffed out his chest and said with determination, “Since I’m not suitable for this world’s cultivation path, I’ll open up my own cultivation path! If this world can’t accommodate me, I’ll destroy it and create a new world!”

Qin Yu was moved, and tremendously shocked.

Wu Ji’s cultivation seemed to be incredibly tough. Just as the elderly man had said, this world was not suitable for him to cultivate at all. No matter how hard Wu Ji worked, his cultivation advancement was extremely slow.

It had been a hundred years or so but Wu Ji’s cultivation was still at Nascent Soul Realm.

Unlike other geniuses who sailed through to the top, his cultivation was extremely difficult. He did not have any outstanding achievements and was disliked wherever he went.

But even so, Wu Ji did not give up. Instead, he began to evolve his own dao technique and created his own unique way of cultivation!

Wu Ji was still thin, but the aura on his body was incomparably formidable!

He used incomparably powerful means to kill heaven’s favorite of the same realm. The heirs of various great aristocratic families were all destroyed by his great strength!

Then, the scene in front of him changed.

Wu Ji in Nascent Soul Realm, was facing seven Reversion to Void Stage cultivators from the older generation.

However, there was no fear in Wu Ji’s eyes. One could only see the word “invincible” on him!

He pushed forward with an unstoppable force, and with an incredibly overbearing manner, he forcefully killed seven people!

That invincible posture was deeply imprinted in Qin Yu’s mind. That thin figure viewed from behind looked incomparably tall at this moment!

Wu Ji was only in the Nascent Soul Realm, but the shadow of an Immortal Emperor could already be seen on him as if he was meant to attain dao.

The scene continued to change. This time, Wu Ji sat cross-legged as if he was comprehending the dao technique and opening up the path of cultivation.

Qin Yu looked at his figure and could not help but mutter. At this moment, Qin Yu seemed to be Wu Ji himself, feeling the dao technique with Wu Ji.

Qin Yu reached out his hand, unconsciously wanting to touch Wu Ji.

However, the moment he reached out his hand, his divine sense returned to his true body.

Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes. The Traceless Immortal Scripture was quietly placed before him.

“So… The Traceless Immortal Scripture actually left the cultivation path of Wu Ji.” Qin Yu was tremendously shocked. This kind of inheritance was naturally incomparably formidable. It was almost equivalent to cultivating and comprehending with an invincible great cultivator!

However, no one knew how many years it would take to comprehend the Traceless Immortal Scripture.

According to the records, Wu Ji had risen from an ordinary youth to a powerful existence. In the Degenerate Age, he had forcefully stepped into the Tribulation Transcending Stage. The process took a total of 2,000 years.

It was an extremely exaggerated number. Even peerless geniuses like Yan Tianming and Demon Emperor had spent 3,000 or so years to enter the Tribulation Transcending Stage. However, Wu Ji, in the Degenerate Age, only took 2,000 years to enter the Tribulation Transcending Stage. Moreover, he swept through everything in the world and became a legend of his generation.

“Don’t tell me that I have to spend 2,000 years to comprehend the Traceless Immortal Scripture!” Qin Yu could not help but feel a headache.

Even if only Wu Ji’s cultivation was left in the Immortal Scripture, it would probably take hundreds of years to completely comprehend it!

Qin Yu was naturally willing to spend hundreds of years witnessing the rise of a legend. However, to the current Qin Yu, this was simply unrealistic. He did not have that much time.

While Qin Yu was reading the Traceless Immortal Scripture, 10 days or so had passed in the outside world.

Si Qianjing entered the Dragon Burial Cave again in the past 10 days or so, but the result was the same. He was still suppressed by the internal qi and could not take even half a step forward.

“If it doesn’t work, we can only forcefully burn our blood essence.” Si Qianjing’s eyes turned cold, and a trace of ruthlessness rose in his heart.

The two elderly men beside him did not speak.

At their age, not much of their lifespan was left.

In terms of lifespan, they were much older than Xuan Jizi. Even if they continued to live, they would only have a hundred years left.

“Or we wait for Si Liuhe to break through,” at this moment, a True Saint said quietly.

Si Qianjing didn’t say anything. He certainly trusted Si Liuhe’s talent, but it wasn’t easy to become a True Saint. No one knew how long it would take.

The scene fell into silence.

A moment later, Si Qianjing’s eyes flashed with ruthlessness.

“Even if it’s the Golden Age, my cultivation can’t advance by half a step. I might as well fight for the Si family one last time.”

The two people beside him were surprised. They looked at Si Qianjing and said, “You… Do you really want to burn your blood essence?”

Si Qianjing took a deep breath and said slowly, “It’s been too long since the Si family made a move. Many people have already forgotten how terrifying our Si family is… It’s time to do something.”
