2198 Another Roadblock

He had initially wanted to go to the Heavenly Origin Continent. However, from the looks of it now, the dao techniques here were somewhat weak. Therefore, there was no need for him to stay here.

He had to return to the Holy Region as soon as possible before he could advance.

Thinking of the geniuses of the Holy Region, Qin Yu was under a lot of pressure even though he had entered the True Saint Realm.

“What about you guys? When can we reach the Black Platform?”

“In half a year.” The other underling was scared that he wanted to kill him. He seemed to be even more brutal than their captain.

Trembling, he ran to the bow and started the warship.

“See you again!”

Qin Yu cupped his hands to Uncle Qun and Yun Qingyun. Since Uncle Qun no longer welcomed him on the ship, he did not have to force him.

“Uncle Qun, Brother Qin seems to have just arrived in this galaxy, and it’s still full of dangers here. Do we split just like this? Moreover, he’s just saved us.”

Yun Qingyun bit her lips and said reluctantly.

“Qingyun, the main thing is that he has offended the Skeleton Gang. Following him with our current strength would be like a mantis trying to stop a chariot. Moreover, he had initially wanted to go to the Heavenly Origin Continent but suddenly changed his mind. I guessed he wants to go back to his so-called Holy Region.”

“That’s right! That’s right! This kind of arrogant person will probably die a horrible death.”

Fengqing came over stinky and said with a vicious look on his face.

Just now, he was scared shitless by the genuine power of the True Saint and was embarrassed on the ship like a monkey now.

Sitting in the boat, Qin Yu closed his eyes to feel the insights left behind from the battle with Wu Ji.

The dao technique of the Traceless Immortal Scripture turned into strokes and appeared in Qin Yu’s mind, like unraveling the cocoon and extracting the silk. He earnestly absorbed everything that this mighty realm cultivator had taught him.

“Hmm?”

Qin Yu opened his eyes, and a dazzling light flashed before him.

“Mr. Qin, we’ve arrived at Black Platform. Sit tight.”

The underling controlling the bow sneered and said. Suddenly, the entire warship shook violently and plunged into the nebula in front.

A continent with lush trees and a sky emitting a hazy atmosphere appeared before Qin Yu.

Was this the Black Platform Continent?

“Stop for an inspection!”

A few soldiers blocked the passage. The leader was a black-bearded man whose muscles emanated a domineering internal qi.

“Peak of SemiSaint. Not bad.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly.

“Brother Hu, help! Brother Hu, this guy robbed our ship and Brother Zhuang was killed by him. He even threatened us to sail for him or he would kill us.”

The underling steering the ship wailed like a ghost and suddenly clung to the captain’s thigh.

Hei Hu looked at the ship before him with a murderous expression.

“Is what you said true?”

“It’s absolutely true. The recorder on the ship has also recorded the video of this madman killing people.”

“How dare you kill my brother! Do you know the Black Platform Continent doesn’t allow intercepting thieves? Kneel!”

Hei Hu drew his saber, and the saber’s light instantly pressed down on Qin Yu’s shoulder.

“What?” Qin Yu looked at him with a faint smile. “Do you convict me just based on his words? Cleary, that muscular man had wanted to rob me but was not skillful enough and fell under my fist.”

“You have a sharp tongue! My brother is just a step away from becoming a True Saint! What did you do to harm my brother?”

Hei Hu’s face filled with killing intent. He and his brother had occupied this Black Platform Galaxy for many years. Suddenly, one of them died. It was something he could not accept.

“I said kneel!”

Hei Hu let out a furious roar, and a massive saber light slashed directly at Qin Yu’s head. The sharp saber light seemed to split the air as well.

“Clang!”

A crisp sound of metal colliding rang out. When the light dissipated, Qin Yu had a cold smile, and his body did not even move.

The saber light did not even leave a mark on his forehead.

“How could it be?”

Hei Hu stepped back, his face filled with disbelief.

“Is this your strength?”

Qin Yu stepped forward. “You may die now!”

He grabbed Hei Hu’s head with one hand. With a casual grab, it seemed that even the air in the space solidified, making Hei Hu immobilized.

“Activate the city defense formation. A fanatic wants to start a war at Black Platform!”

For a moment, the crowd at the city gate surged, and the light of all kinds of magical artifacts shone.

“Miss, please stand behind me. Black Platform City seems to have a new look today.”

An elderly man stood at the bow of the warship, and a mountain-like dense internal qi enveloped a woman in white.

“Interesting. Although our Black Platform Continent is small, it is the hub that connects all the galaxies. It is also guarded by our three great aristocratic families and countless sects. How could anyone dare to cause trouble here?”

A young man sneered and said. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Young Master Lin Cheng, don’t worry. The city defense formation has been activated. We should be able to take down this madman very soon,” one of the attendants said with a smile.

“Activating the city defense formation requires a lot of magical artifacts and spiritual stones. After we capture this madman, we must interrogate him properly before throwing him into purgatory.”

Lin Cheng said with a cold expression.

Purgatory.

The attendant beside him could not help but tremble. He had heard that a True Saint rogue cultivator had become a lunatic after entering purgatory for half a month.

Qin Yu was expressionless, allowing the light of the grand formation to fall on him.

The surrounding air seemed to have become viscous under the circulation of the grand formation.

All the air rushed toward Qin Yu like waves. Qin Yu’s body became heavy, and he instantly felt the pressure as heavy as a mountain.

“Hahaha! Madman, go to hell! Wait for the formation to turn you into a meat patty. It’s a formation set up by our City Lord himself. I’m afraid even True Saint Realm cultivators won’t be able to shake it.”

Hei Hu laughed wildly.

This formation was not simple.

Qin Yu finally got serious. Even as a True Saint Realm, his movement started to be restricted by the flow of the formation.

If higher-level magical artifacts had been used to set up the formation, its power would probably increase tremendously.

The Saintly Body Technique!

A burst of golden light exploded from Qin Yu’s body. The mist formed by the grand formation actually seemed to be afraid at this moment.

They all rolled to the side, and Qin Yu threw a punch.

All the mist suddenly twisted into a vortex, following Qin Yu’s fist to form a cloud pillar.

Charging at Hai Hu’s body, he was sent flying, and it only stopped after crashing into countless city walls.

“Crack!”

The formation was directly broken by this powerful impact air current. A burst of light flickered on the city wall.

Suddenly, dozens of magical artifacts exploded, and the people controlling the magical artifacts were sent flying by the shock wave.

“Quickly send a signal for help!”

Hei Hu was terrified.

“You may die now.”

Qin Yu lifted Hei Hu’s neck and was about to crush it.

“Brother, please stop!”

Elder Lin’s figure appeared beside Qin Yu and pressed down on Qin Yu’s palm with one hand.

“Brother, please listen to me.”

The elderly man was secretly shocked. Although the city defense formation had used ordinary magical articles, even he could not break it so casually.
