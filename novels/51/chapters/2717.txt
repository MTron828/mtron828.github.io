Chapter 2718: The Eight Trigrams Formation 2

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Power of Gen! Come!” The phantom of mountains suddenly appeared. The power of countless mountains in the Saint Kingdom was sucked over.

Eight different forces gathered in eight different directions.

Eight energy pillars of different attributes soared into the sky. The energy of each pillar was not strong.

It was probably only the energy from Dao Realm level 2 which poured into the eight trigrams.

The two fishes slowly rotated and countless symbols appeared around the eight trigrams.

An ancient internal qi suddenly erupted. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

This was a brand-new attribute of power combining the energy of eight different attributes.

It formed a brand-new attribute of power that slowly swam in the eight trigrams and then entered the temple block’s body.

The two temple blocks transformed into giant Kun Peng and slowly swam away from the center of the eight trigram disc.

Then, they slowly approached Qin Yu in a spiral-like trajectory.

Qin Yu’s body slowly emitted a silver internal qi. This aura was emitted from every pore on his body.

Even his head was spewing out endless silver smoke. Every part of his skin was trembling violently.

His view was occupied by the two Kun Peng. They slowly approached Qin Yu.

However, Qin Yu was enveloped by an internal qi now. Countless invisible chains on the eight trigrams sealed all the acupoints in Qin Yu’s body, making it extremely difficult to lift even a finger.

Whether it was the Kun Peng or the power emitted by the eight trigrams, it seemed to be infinitely vast.

It seemed to contain the internal qi of the universe. Qin Yu had never seen the power of this attribute before.

This might be an even higher level of power, suppressing the power of Qin Yu’s body to a dead end.

“Brat, this Saint Kingdom is far bigger than you imagine. Perhaps you have some strength and talent, but this is the most worthless thing in the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom.”

Yi Yun sneered.

As one of the largest factions in the core region, the Guardian of Order could even influence the position of the Holy Lord.

The foundation of this force was not what ordinary people could imagine.

These eight law enforcement officers were one of the trump cards of the force.

They were rare octuplets that the higher- ups of the Guardian of Order had been taken in since they were young.

They cultivated the same cultivation technique and in the end, they combined it with the ancient Great Expansion Divine Technique.

The eight powers combined and triggered the power of the Kun Peng. This was a power of a higher level than the Saint Power.

Although this power was condensed from eight powers in Dao Realm level two, it was still extremely powerful.

The power that it gave off was enough to threaten any Dao Realm expert.

Even Yi Yun was unable to break through this power. He was not the strongest combat strength of the Guardian of Order but the eight guardians.

Hong Luan and Lord Tang beside him revealed shocked expressions.

Only at their level did they know how terrifying the Kun Peng formed by the two temple blocks was.

The Saint Power in Qin Yu’s body began to surge. It was squeezed from every cell and every meridian until nothing was left.

His hair moved without wind blowing and his entire body was bound.

It was a kind of power restriction in his cells, acupoint, blood vessels, and muscles.

However, he still had his body to resist this power!

“Come on! Let me experience this new power!”

Qin Yu raised his head with difficulty. He did not expect to encounter such a terrifying attack.

But so what?

He would not surrender to this kind of power!

“As you wish!”

The eight persons shouted in unison.

The two Kun Peng collided with Qin Yu’s body one after another. The collision was as light as a bubble bursting.

The two Kun Peng exploded just like that. There was not even a trace of energy fluctuation.

The surrounding people were at a loss. Everyone only had one thought in their minds, ‘That’s it?’.

However, a blood-stained eight-trigram disk appeared behind Qin Yu in the next second.

The compass seemed to have formed a world of its own. Its huge Eight Trigrams Formation Disk was even taller than the sky.

Qin Yu seemed to be a small dot among them. Countless chains were tied to his body.

Moreover, the top of the Eight Trigrams Formation was covered in blood that had solidified into a scab.

Countless heads were hanging on the Eight Trigrams Formation Disk.

Although they had been bones for countless years, everyone in the square started to tremble uncontrollably when the internal qi was emitted. “What the he*l is this thing? It’s so ominous!”

Hong Luan cursed as she stared at the solidified Eight Trigrams Formation Disk and let out a trembling sound.

Qin Yu’s body lasted for almost 0.1 seconds.

Boundless blood mist erupted and his entire body was torn into thousands of pieces.

Night Qi!

Among the countless pieces of flesh on the compass, a black gas enveloped all the pieces of flesh.

Traces of Dream Qi slowly spread out, but the invincible Dream Qi seemed to have been greatly restricted.

Qin Yu could not completely transfer the damage. He felt his consciousness rapidly blurring.

His expression changed drastically and he no longer hesitated.

All the Night Qi was poured into the ring. The space in the ring suddenly opened up and absorbed all of Qin Yu’s minced meat.

“Eh? Such a low-level creature can comprehend the Dao of Dreams. However, such a weak internal qi shouldn’t be able to escape.”

A withered ‘corpse’ suddenly shook slightly in the middle of the huge Eight Trigrams Formation.

Its sunken pupils saw the wisp of Night Qi and it suddenly had an ecstatic expression.

“It’s the Spirit Suppressing Ring of the Nineteenth Prison! No wonder you can escape from this Eight Trigrams Formation!” At this moment, it let out a strange laugh.

The iron chains on its body clanged.

The power that tore Qin Yu apart in an instant only caused the dried corpse to reveal a distorted expression. After a long time, the power of the Eight Trigrams Formation finally slowly retreated.

“Hahahaha! I thought that I would never be able to escape in this life, but now it seems that this world can’t kill me at all!”

It laughed maniacally as boundless killing intent radiated from it.

The moment this power raged out, countless people fainted.

Thousands of people below Dao Realm level 2 had their divine souls affected and turned into fools.

Even for those above level 2, nearly 60% of them fell unconscious.

Lord Tang and the others trembled and fell to the ground.

It was only after the compass disappeared for a long time that they could slowly stand up.

“There’s a living being in that Eight Trigrams Formation! What kind of monster is that?”

At this moment, Hong Luan was still trembling on the ground. Her face was filled with shock.

Just the internal qi that it emitted had forced her to this extent.

What kind of monster was this? Even a Holy Lord probably didn’t have such power..
