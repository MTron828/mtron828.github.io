Chapter 1268: Chapter 1,268, you have bad breath 

Qin Yu’s body was instantly sent flying!

“Qin Yu!”Guan Zhuang’s expression instantly turned extremely ugly!

Qin Yu’s body had smashed through countless mountains and forests, stirring up waves of dust.

Guan Zhuang gritted his teeth and hurriedly ran in Qin Yu’s direction.

As an old hunter, he was very clear about the power of the spirit monarch lion’s Slap! Who knew how many hunters had died under his huge palm!

“Qin Yu!”Guan Zhuang roared all the way, his face revealing waves of panic.

Qin Yu was one of his men. If anything happened to him, he would also be criticized.

“It’s over. This kid didn’t even bring his protective gear. I’m afraid he’s doomed,”Guan Zhuang thought in a low voice.

At this moment, Qin Yu stood up from a collapsed forest.

He rubbed his neck and whispered, “Damn, this beast is quite strong.”

Guan Zhuang hurriedly ran in front of Qin Yu and asked, “How do you feel?”

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Nothing much. I was just scared. Why did this beast suddenly run behind me?”

Guan Zhuang could not hear all this. He circled around Qin Yu and said in surprise, “You... you are not hurt at all?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “This slap can’t hurt me.”

Guan Zhuang could not help but swallow his saliva and muttered softly, “Could it be that this slap from the spirit monarch lion did not exert any strength?”

“Alright, Big Brother Guan, you go and wait at the side. I have to take care of this beast.”Qin Yu rubbed his fist, and a trace of coldness appeared on his face.

That wave of murderous aura made people feel a chill.

At this moment, the Qin Yu in Guan Zhuang’s eyes seemed to have changed into a different person.

He no longer had the slightest bit of mischievous bearing. Instead, it was replaced by an indescribable chill.

The Spirit Monarch Lion was striding its huge body towards Qin Yu step by step.

Its body was indeed extremely huge, not inferior to the purple jade origin snake from before.

And its two pairs of eyes were emitting a dark radiance.

Qin Yu’s face did not show the slightest fear. He looked coldly at the Spirit Monarch Lion and said in a low voice, “If I can use the cosmic form, it should be much more convenient to kill him.”

This made Qin Yu yearn even more for the state of recovering his spiritual power.

“Come, Beast.”Qin Yu took a step forward and took the initiative to walk towards the Spirit Monarch Lion.

Guan Zhuang, who was at the side, hurriedly shouted, “Qin Yu, you must not clash head-on with him!”

With that, Guan Zhuang pulled out a bow and arrow.

Using both his hands and feet, he pulled open this huge bull horn bow.

Following the release of strength, a godly arrow shot towards the Spirit Monarch Lion!

This godly arrow carried an extremely dazzling radiance, burning the surrounding air.

However, it was this godly arrow that only scratched the spirit monarch lion’s fur, and then directly bent.

“This Beast’s body is really tough!”Guan Zhuang could not help but curse.

At this moment, Qin Yu had already walked in front of the Spirit Monarch Lion.

His body appeared extremely tiny in front of the Spirit Monarch Lion, but the aura emitted from his body shocked Guan Zhuang! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Guan Zhuang only felt that Qin Yu’s body had turned into chaos at this moment. In the chaos, it was as if there was a heavenly God standing!

“Huh?”Guan Zhuang was stunned. He hurriedly rubbed his eyes, and the scene just now instantly disappeared.

“Could it be that my eyes are playing tricks on me?”Guan Zhuang said with a frown.

Right at this moment, the Spirit Monarch Lion had already raised its huge palm, crushing towards Qin Yu from all directions!

Its palm was like a huge round plate, blotting out the sky and covering the sun. It was full of imposing manner.

The surrounding ground instantly shattered and dust rose up as if an earthquake had occurred!

“Qin Yu!”Guan Zhuang gritted his teeth. He couldn’t care less about his own safety and rushed towards Qin Yu anxiously.

But at this moment, the spirit monarch Lion’s huge body suddenly rose up as if it was flying!

Guan Zhuang was stunned and frowned. “Since when can this beast fly?”

In the next second, Guan Zhuang realized that something was wrong.

The Spirit Monarch Lion’s body actually slowly turned over, as if it had been thrown out by something!

As expected! Its body completely turned over, and then with a swoosh, it was directly thrown out!

The Spirit Monarch Lion’s huge body slid on the ground, and cracks appeared on the entire ground.

The forest was filled with restless sounds, and countless trees were destroyed. The originally dense forest suddenly became bald, just like the Bald Head of a middle-aged man!

Its furious roar shook the mountains and rivers!

Guan Zhuang could not help but swallow his saliva.

He looked in the direction of Qin Yu, and saw that Qin Yu was standing there, his body still maintaining the posture of a fall.

“You... You threw it out? !”Guan Zhuang asked in a daze.

However, Qin Yu no longer had the cheeky smile on his face. He only glanced at Guan Zhuang and said coldly, “Stand there and don’t move.”

With that, Qin Yu’s feet shook, and he instantly arrived in front of the Spirit Monarch Lion.

His small body stood in front of the spirit monarch lion like a god.

The Spirit Monarch Lion seemed to be enraged. It suddenly got up from the ground and roared angrily at Qin Yu!

This roar contained a strong internal Qi. It was as if a storm had blown up, sweeping up countless mountains and forests!

Even Guan Zhuang felt that he couldn’t stand steadily. He tried his best to stabilize his body, but he still fell to the side.

On the other hand, Qin Yu stood there like a rock, unmoving.

He was not affected by the Spirit Monarch Lion’s roar at all.

At this moment, Qin Yu slowly raised his head.

He looked at the spirit monarch lion coldly and said in a low voice, “Do you know that you have bad breath?”

The spirit monarch lion seemed to be shocked by this human in front of it. Before it could speak, Qin Yu’s body had already exploded, and a terrifying spiritual power appeared on his right fist!
