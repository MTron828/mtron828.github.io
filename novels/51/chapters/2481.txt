2482 The Brilliance of Stars and Moon

The spatial formation relied on complex and massive formation runes and could only be activated with sufficient spiritual energy.

Hearing the elderly man’s words, a strange smile appeared on the handsome young man’s face.

“What an interesting woman. She seems not a bad choice to be a partner. Give me all the information about this woman as soon as possible. I want to know more about her.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Yes, Young Lord.”

Several voices responded concurrently, then left their teams to some unknown places to collect information.

Yan Ruxue’s body moved again. After several consecutive teleportations, she disappeared from the Heavenly Divination Sect’s people.

At this moment, Qin Yu, who had heard the news of Ji Yue, rushed over in anger.

However, when approaching Solitary Cloud City, he received a message from Yan Ruoxue.

“Ruoxue, are you alright?”

Qin Yu asked worriedly as Yan Ruoxue entered the Sumeru World.

“A bunch of nobodies from the Heavenly Divination Sect can’t do anything to me. Don’t worry!”

When Ruoxue saw the anxious Qin Yu, she could not help but feel warmth in her heart.

“Besides the Ten Thousand Buddha Sect, the other sects seem to appear soon. I wonder if the two saints will re-enter the world. Judging from the current situation, it’s only a matter of time before the two saints re-enter the world.”

Lei Xin said in a deep voice.

“If the four sects and four schools are all full of this kind of people, I’m afraid that even if they appear, they might not bring much help to the human race.”

Qin Yu shouted coldly.

“There’s a reason why the four sects and four schools have been around for so long, even longer than the aristocratic families. However, there’s one thing that you’ve said. It’s tough for humans to stay united, even during the chaotic times in the past.”

Lei Xin smiled bitterly. There were some dark truths that he did not want to reveal.

During this chaotic time, strength was the only thing that mattered.

In fact, some of the great cultivators praised in the songs of bards had their hands stained with the power of blood and darkness. However, these things were all covered up in the face of the chaotic time.

“Dean, how do these ancient sects compare to the nine great aristocratic families?”

“It’s hard to tell. The nine great aristocratic families are the strongest force of the human race on the surface, while the four sects and four schools have always been hiding in the dark. They should have the same resources, but the four sects and four schools are definitely stronger in terms of combat strength. As for the two great saints, there’s no need to mention them. They have always been the strongest force of the human race.”

In fact, there were very few such competitions. After all, the two forces had never fought before, so it was not easy to compare them.

“I feel that Solitary Cloud City will not be able to withstand the attack of the monster race sooner or later. The human race’s continent will be destroyed one by one, and the final fortress will probably be in the Holy Region. Let’s go back to the Holy Region first. We have to spread the news about the one billion humans. This way, perhaps the human cultivators will be alerted.”

After seeing the monster race army and the intrigue among the humans this time, Lei Xin felt deeply helpless even though he was ambitious.

“I hope this matter can unite the human cultivators.”

Flower Granny sighed and said.

They concealed their internal qi and teleported back to the Holy Region to prevent conflict.

After that, they spread the news of the Solitary Shadow Continent to all the big bounty clubs non-stop. Within a few days, this news spread throughout the entire Holy Region.

The eight-winged Monster race, the new Fallen Godly King, and the lives of one billion humans all touched the nerves of the human cultivators.

Only now did they realize that the strength of the alien race had reached such a level without them realizing it.

Many rogue cultivators began to organize themselves and travel to various continents to hunt the demons and monster races.

However, the various aristocratic families and sects did not make any big moves. They seemed to be waiting for the matter to develop.

“With the current situation, we must do our best no matter what. We will use Jue Wu’s Huaning Mountain as a base to form an alliance. We hope to protect the human race during the future war and not let the tragedy of the Solitary Shadow Continent happen again.”

Le Xin hesitated for a moment before suggesting.

“Alright, I agree.”

Now, with the addition of the disciples of Azure Firmament Sect, the members of the Ji family, and the people from the Thunder Courtyard, their combat strength was considered feasible to form an alliance.

Moreover, it could also attract more experts to come forward and prepare wholeheartedly.

Seeing no objection from the people, Le Xin asked everyone to come up with a name. After that, he could announce the alliance through various large guilds.

With the alliance’s current strength, even if it was against the power of an aristocratic family, Qin Yu did not feel any fear.

“Let’s call it the Human Race Watch. I hope the people joining us purely want to protect the human race. For those who have selfish motives, we don’t want them no matter how powerful they are.”

Qin Yu said softly.

“Alright, let’s call it the Human Race Watch. I’ll get the Ji family to spread the news immediately. With the reputation of Dean Lei, he should be able to attract a large number of cultivators.”

Among them, Lei Xin was the most reputable.

Furthermore, in the past battles, they had shown their unyieldness. Lei Xin’s reputation was quite prestigious.

Following that, Qin Yu sorted out the cultivation methods he had obtained previously.

He was surprised to discover a set of joint attack techniques among the cultivation techniques his father had left behind for him.

This set of cultivation methods was called the Brilliance of Stars and Moon. After cultivating it to a certain level, one could fuse their powers to launch a joint attack.

It was somewhat similar to the joint attack of the monster race, but the strength depended on the specific goal of the mind.

If the minds varied, the power of one plus one might even be less than one.

If they worked together, their attacks could be comparable to the stars and moons.

Qin Yu showed the technique to Yan Ruoxue, Flower Granny, and the others.

“This joint attack is truly marvelous. If the human race could stay united and cultivate this technique, I’m afraid that even the alien race would have to retreat, let alone slaughter us humans.”

This cultivation technique was even comparable to the Thunder Immortal Scripture. Moreover, Lei Xin had never heard of this cultivation method before.

“Unfortunately, although this technique is exquisite, one has to abolish the power of one’s past cultivation. Moreover, it is tough to expect everyone to be united. We can only start promoting it through the Human Race Watch. They should cultivate voluntarily, but we can’t force them if they object to it.”

Flower Granny had wanted to see if she could improve it. However, after taking a look, she felt it incomparably exquisite. Even if she spent a lot of time, she could create such a cultivation method.
