Chapter 509: Xia Hang Again Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The group of people headed towards the northwest region.

At this moment, Qin Yu was also heading to the address given by the Pavilion Master as he sped away.

In the northwest region, there was a no man’s land.

This place was covered in sandstorms and the weather was terrible. At a glance, other than the sky full of yellow sand and a winding mountain range, there was nothing else.

This place was named the Black Alcohol No Man’s Land. It was large, but it wasn’t famous.

Recently, many uninvited guests had come to this Black Alcohol No Man’s Land.

A number of luxurious cars were parked at the foot of the Black Alcohol No Man’s Land mountain range.

On the cars, there were a few big words printed: Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

The moment the car stopped, Xia Hang and the others got out of the car.

Among this group of people, there were disciples of the Yan family, people from the Han family, and young masters from aristocratic families from other regions.

They were extremely privileged. As long as they were talented, they were destined to have a smooth path.

“President Xia, is this the Dragon Vein you were talking about?”

The person who spoke was a member of the Yan family. His name was Yan Yuqi.

He was only eighteen years old, but he had already stepped into the peak of the Inner Strength Grandmaster Realm!

Ever since Yan Sihai ascended to power, he had attached great importance to him.

Xia Hang nodded slightly and said, “That’s right.”

A trace of greed flashed in Yan Yuqi’s eyes. He narrowed his eyes and said, “If there are really top-grade herbs in this Dragon Vein, I might be able to break through.”

Xia Hang patted Yan Yuqi’s shoulder and said, “Not maybe, but definitely!”

“Yuqi, everyone in the Yan family has a high opinion of you. They say that you’re the next Yan Jinyao. Don’t let everyone down.”

The corner of Yan Yuqi’s mouth lifted slightly, and he said with a nonchalant smile, “I’ll surpass my brother sooner or later.”

Unlike the low-profile Yan Jinyao, Yan Yuqi was extremely ambitious!

He was only eighteen years old, and he was very arrogant. In addition, he was very talented, so he was very smug.

Even Yan Jinyao, who was known as the number one genius of Jingdu, wasn’t worth mentioning in his eyes.

“When do we set off?” Yan Yuqi asked.

Xia Hang said lightly, “There’s no rush. Allow me to make some inquiries first.”

Although the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s control of resources was very strong, there were still random people who came to join in the fun. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Almost every one of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s activities was no exception.

From the Martial Marquis to the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm, among the prisoners held by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, a large portion of them were random people who came to snatch resources.

Qin Yu also rushed to the no man’s land in a travel-worn state.

A few miles away, Qin Yu saw this winding and undulating mountain range.

Although it was far away, Qin Yu still felt that this mountain range was extraordinary!

“As expected of the Dragon’s Vein. It’s really imposing,” Qin Yu thought to himself as he stared into the distance.

From a high vantage point, this mountain range looked like a dragon’s spine. It was winding and undulating, giving off an extremely oppressive feeling.

The internal qi emitted by the mountain range wasn’t spiritual energy. Instead, it gave off an indescribable sense of majesty.

“Huh?”

Soon, Qin Yu discovered the internal qis near the mountain range.

Ever since Qin Yu stepped into the Consummate Inner Strength Grandmaster Realm, his divine sense had skyrocketed. It was difficult to escape Qin Yu’s sharp divine sense within a radius of tens of miles.

“One, two, three... a total of six half-step Martial Marquises?”

Qin Yu’s expression was somewhat unsightly!

One had to know that the number of half-step Martial Marquises in the world was extremely small. Even the Saint Confucian Sect, which was known as the number one sect in the north, would find it difficult to gather six half-step Martial Marquises!

“The only organization who can possess so much power is probably the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.” Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed slightly.

“They’re quite fast.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but snort coldly from a great distance away.

“It’s best if you don’t provoke me, or else I’ll kill all of you!” Qin Yu said coldly.

With the absence of a Martial Marquis, Qin Yu was completely unafraid.

He took a step forward and was about to head toward the mountain range when another internal qi approached from not far away.

Qin Yu stopped in his tracks and couldn’t help but turn around to look.

He saw a man with a mustache and a rather wretched appearance walking over.

This man looked to be about thirty years old, but his wretched appearance didn’t match his age.

“Fellow, are you also here to search for the Dragon’s Vein?” The man stroked his handlebar mustache and took the initiative to greet him.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “What do you think?”

The man with the handlebar mustache stroked his beard and said with a smile, “There is a dragon’s den and a tiger’s den ahead. There is also the Jingdu Martial Arts Association standing guard. This journey is quite dangerous.”

Hearing his words, Qin Yu couldn’t help but smile and say, “Since you know, why did you still dare to come?”

The man with the mustache said proudly, “How can you be compared to me? In this world, there is no place that I don’t dare to go!”

“From the Qin Dynasty’s emperor’s tomb to my grandmother’s tomb, as long as there are treasures, I will be there!”

Speaking up to this point, the man with the mustache said mysteriously, “To tell you the truth, I dug up a Divine Rank cauldron in my grandmother’s tomb! How is it? Are you interested in introducing your ancestor’s tomb to me?”

“F * ck you,” Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse.

This man with the mustache looked like a clown and didn’t look very serious.

“Don’t worry. May the deceased rest in peace while the living must move on with their lives!” The man with the mustache said with a smile.

Qin Yu pointed at his nose and said, “Don’t bother me, or don’t blame me for being rude.”

After saying this, Qin Yu no longer paid attention to the man with the mustache and walked toward the mountain range.

Other than Qin Yu and this man, there were also other people who came here.

And when Qin Yu arrived, someone had already taken the lead.

A man and a woman stood in the middle of Xia Hang while shivering.

And the people of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association surrounded him in the middle.

“Who told you guys to come here? Do you know that this is the resource of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?” Xia Hang said coldly.

The young man said with a trembling voice, “I... I’m sorry, we... we will leave right now...”

“Leave?” Xia Hang snorted coldly.

“You want to leave after stealing from someone else’s home?”

The young man’s expression changed, and he hurriedly said, “I... I really didn’t know that this was the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s place. Please... please spare us...”

Xia Hang snorted coldly and said, “You have already violated the rules set by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. Stand here obediently and follow me back to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association to go to jail!”

“I’m warning you, it’s best not to think about escaping. Even if you escape to the ends of the earth, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association will still be able to catch you!”

The young man’s face instantly turned ashen.

“I want to know which rule we have violated?” The young girl seemed to be unable to hold it in.

“This is a natural resource. What right do you have to say that it belongs to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?”

Xia Hang narrowed his eyes and shouted, “If I say so, then it is! All the martial arts resources in the world are allocated by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”

“F * ck your bullsh*t! Why is the Jingdu Martial Arts Association so overbearing?”

At this moment, a voice sounded.
