Chapter 1027: Chapter 1,027, razing the Wan family’s Secret Territory! 

Li Yu was instantly dumbfounded.

This was Qin Yu’s ability, but it did not mean that all martial saints could do it.

...

In the secret territory.

Wan Gu Qiong was enjoying his happy days.

Ever since he had returned to the Wan family’s secret territory, he had relaxed his entire body and mind.

There were servants serving fine wine and delicacies, and there were even beauties sleeping on the bed. He was living a very happy life.

“If it wasn’t for Yan Ruoxue, why would I have to leave the mystic realm? Are these days not pleasant?”Wan Gu Qiong looked up at the side of the bed with a happy expression.

“It’s a pity that I wasn’t able to bring the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion to the bed...”

Wan Gu Qiong felt waves of pity when he thought of Ji Yuhong.

“If there’s a chance, I’ll definitely bring the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion to the Wan family Mystic Realm! When the time comes, let’s see where she can run to!”

Just as Wan Gu Qiong was thinking about it, a loud sound suddenly came from outside!

“Boom!”

Hearing this sound, Wan Gu Qiong hurriedly sat up.

“What’s going on?”Wan Gu Qiong asked coldly.

Before he could answer, another loud sound came from outside!

This time, the entire house was making a loud noise, and the earth shook and the mountains shook!

The Wan family’s secret realm was in a mess. Everyone felt uneasy about this sudden change.

“What’s going on? Where did this huge sound come from?”

“Could it be that the secret realm is unstable and is about to break?”

“Then... then are we buried in there?”

Wan Gu Qiong’s face darkened as he shouted, “Calm down! What’s going on?”

Everyone quieted down when they saw Wan Gu Qiong.

Wan Gu Qiong looked at the person beside him and said, “Go and see what’s going on. Find out where this sound came from.”

“Yes!”An attendant beside him hurriedly nodded.

A few minutes later.

This attendant hurriedly ran back.

“Not good, young master wan. Outside... there seems to be someone forcefully barging into the mystic realm outside!”The attendant said somewhat fearfully.

“Forcefully barging into the Mystic Realm?”

Hearing this, Wan Guqiong couldn’t help but sneer repeatedly.

“It’s probably that Qin Yu.”Very quickly, Wan guqiong guessed who it was.

At this moment, a middle-aged man slowly walked over from not far away.

When everyone saw this middle-aged man, they all bowed.

This person was none other than the head of the Wan family, Wan Zhengye!

“Dad.”Wan guqiong greeted Wan Zhengye.

Wan Zhengye nodded slightly and said coldly, “What’s Going On?”

“Dad, I’m afraid that Qin Yu is forcing his way into the mystic realm.”Wan guqiong said.

“Forcefully breaking into the secret realm?”Wan Zhengye could not help but smile as he shook his head.

“I’m afraid that Qin Yu has gone mad. He’s desperate to seek help? So what if he has become a martial saint? Forcefully breaking into the secret realm? It’s simply a pipe dream!”

Wan Gu Qiong also said with a smile, “That’s right. How could a martial saint forcefully break into the secret realm...”

“Boom!”

However, as soon as he finished speaking, a loud sound burst out!

At a glance, a divine light burst out from the direction of the exit!

This light scattered in all directions and spread to the horizon. Soon after, a series of shattering sounds could be heard!

The faces of the Wan family members changed drastically in unison!

Wan Gu Qiong’s face turned ashen!

He subconsciously grabbed Wan Zhengye’s arm and said in a trembling voice, “Dad... Dad, he couldn’t have really forced his way in, right?”

“What are you panicking for!”Wan Zhengye berated.

“Let’s not talk about whether he has the ability or not. So what if he has barged in? Does he really think our Wan family is made of mud? How dare a mere martial Saint Act Rashly?”

With Wan Zhengye’s words, Wan Guqiong was clearly relieved.

“Go, set up the first line of defense. If he really barges in, kill him without mercy!”Wan Zhengye said coldly.

...

At the entrance, pieces of space shattered like glass.

After stepping through the entrance, it was the Wan family’s secret realm.

Li Yu couldn’t help but suck in a cold breath when he saw this scene!

He actually... really broke it open by force?

There was a way to open the secret realm by using one’s fist?

As a secret realm master, this was simply... unheard of!

“The secret realm is only So-so,”Qin Yu said coldly. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

He turned to look at the heaven gate disciples and said coldly, “Everyone, listen up. Follow me and we will destroy the Wan family’s Mystic Realm!”

“Destroy the Wan family’s Mystic Realm!”

They shouted in unison, and their voices were deafening!

The warriors hiding not far away were even more dumbfounded!

“He... seems to have opened the Wan family’s Mystic Realm with his fist...”

“Pervert... pervert, this is too perverted!”

“If this were to spread out, I’m afraid no one would believe it. Fortunately, I took a photo in advance...”

“Let’s go, hurry up and follow him!”

Qin Yu led everyone and Strode into the secret realm.

The entrance of the secret realm was already broken, and anyone could enter at will.

After Qin Yu led everyone into the Wan family’s secret realm, the surrounding martial artists hurriedly followed.

Three hundred people stepped into the Wan family’s secret realm.

Qin Yu walked at the front and Strode forward.

Soon, he saw the so-called first line of defense.

More than ten people were controlling a formation at the same time.

This formation seemed to be a spatial barrier, emitting dense qi.

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu couldn’t help but Snort coldly.

His two fists drew an arc in the air, and then suddenly punched toward the spatial barrier!

“Boom!”

The golden light streaked across the sky, and in an instant, the wind and clouds surged. The golden light surged over, and such an aura shook the entire internal Qi!

The dozen or so people in charge of controlling the barrier were instantly subdued by this aura, and their faces could not help but flash with fear.

“Boom!”

Under this punch, the spatial barrier directly exploded!

And the dozen or so people were instantly shaken into a bloody mist!

Without the barrier to stop them, the Wan family’s secret realm was like a lamb waiting to be slaughtered.

“Everyone listen up. Those who dare to resist will be killed without mercy!”Qin Yu said coldly.

“Yes!”

The three hundred people were like thugs as they charged into the Wan family’s secret realm!

Wan Zhengye quickly ordered his subordinates to set up one block after another along the path of Qin Yu and the others.

“Clan leader, it’s bad! Our second line of defense has been broken through!”

“Clan leader, the third line of defense that we just erected has also been shattered!”

“Clan leader...”

As the lines of defense were shattered one after another, Wan Zhengye’s expression became increasingly unsightly.

He made a prompt decision and gathered all the martial saints of the Wan clan to welcome Qin Yu’s arrival.

However, Wan Gu Qiong was extremely uneasy.

He had a strong sense of danger. Under this sense of danger, Wan Gu Qiong actually planned to abandon the Wan clan’s Secret Realm and escape!

However, just as he was about to leave, the space in front of him suddenly distorted!

That spatial barrier was like a cage, blocking his path!

“You want to leave? Do you think you can leave?”He turned around and saw Qin Yu walking over step by step.
