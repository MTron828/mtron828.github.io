Chapter 1404: Chapter 1,404, I will be the first one out

Iron Egg didn’t reply, no matter how much Qin Yu shouted.

The initiative of the body once again returned to Qin Yu’s hands.

He looked at this resurrected gigantic divine inscription formation, feeling somewhat uncertain.

Because Qin Yu didn’t know whether this divine inscription formation was as exaggerated as iron egg had said.

Qin Yu raised his head and stared at the gigantic dragon-headed carriage high in the sky.

The carriage carried a surging killing intent. It was like an enormous dark cloud, pressing down on people until they couldn’t breathe.

The first elder’s expression was ice-cold, while the linen-robed elder frowned.

“What was that light just now?”The first elder asked with a frown.

The linen-robed elder snorted and said, “We have already missed the best opportunity. This Qin Yu must have activated some kind of formation.”

“Array Formation?”The first elder narrowed his eyes.

“That’s right. Although I don’t know what array formation it is, I’m sure that Qin Yu must have activated it,”the hemp-robed elder said in a deep voice.

“The reason why Qin Yu didn’t answer just now is probably to resurrect this array formation. We were deceived by that disciple. He deserved to die.”The hemp-robed elder took a deep breath, and his expression became even colder. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

He didn’t dare to shift the responsibility to the great elder, so he could only let the person who gave the suggestion take the blame.

The Great Elder wasn’t stupid. Of course, he knew that he had made a mistake. However, as a shrewd decision-maker, he couldn’t admit that he had made a mistake.

He looked coldly at the divine capital city and snorted lightly, “I don’t care what array formation you have. Just Break It!”

The hemp-robed elder remained silent. He knew that this array formation was definitely not that simple. Otherwise, Qin Yu wouldn’t have spent such a huge price to resurrect this array formation.

The first elder slowly stood up from the carriage. He looked at the divine capital city and slowly raised his hands. His fingers also curled up.

An extremely powerful force slowly gathered in his palms. A terrifying radiance bloomed between his palms like a sun.

Everyone could feel this oppressive feeling.

As the first elder extended his palm, that radiance instantly blotted out the sky and Earth. It was like a circular plate. It grew bigger and bigger as it crushed towards the divine capital city!

Qin Yu’s pupils constricted. He crossed his arms in front of him and prepared himself.

“Boom!”

The light smashed onto the divine capital! And at this moment, the divine capital instantly erupted with golden light. Numerous divine patterns that were like chains appeared densely!

Those divine patterns seemed to be formed from countless characters. They covered the divine capital and easily withstood the first elder’s technique!

The deafening boom sounded, but the entire city was undamaged.

Qin Yu looked at the sky filled with golden light in shock. He was incomparably excited!

“Tie Dan this kid really didn’t lie to me!”Qin Yu couldn’t help but be incomparably excited!

As for the first elder on the carriage, his face was ashen.

“As expected.”The hemp-robed elder took a deep breath.

The first elder looked at the hemp-robed elder and said, “Do you know what kind of array formation this is?”

“I don’t know. I’ve never heard of it.”The hemp-robed elder shook his head.

“But I can confirm that this array formation is not ordinary.”

The great elder glanced at him and said, “You don’t have to say such nonsense.”

The hemp-robed elder remained silent, but he could not help but Snort coldly in his heart.

If you had not delayed the opportunity to fight, this Qin Yu would have been in the bag a long time ago.

The great elder put his hands behind his back. He looked at Qin Yu, who was hiding in the divine capital city, and said coldly, “What? Do you plan to be a coward?”

Qin Yu laughed and said, “Great Elder, I’m in the divine capital city. What can you do to me? If you have the ability, then attack me by force!”

The great elder narrowed his eyes and said with a sneer, “Do you really think that I can’t do anything to Your Broken Array Formation? Everyone, Listen Up! Attack me by Force!”

With an order, the three hundred horses on the iron horses all gathered. They launched extremely fierce spells in the high sky.

In an instant, the magical artifacts blotted out the sky and covered the earth. The light was even more dazzling!

All of their spells were directed straight at the Divine Capital!

The Divine Capital once again emitted a golden glow, enveloping the entire city like an impregnable fortress.

All of the spells seemed to be of little value under this divine inscription array formation.

Hundreds of people took turns to attack. After several hours, they had almost exhausted their spiritual energy. Yet, the divine capital was still unharmed.

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief.

“Hahahaha! Great Elder, it seems that your method won’t work!”Qin Yu roared.

Great Elder’s face became increasingly gloomy. He narrowed his eyes and said, “If you don’t come out, I will execute Di Zun and the others! And I will execute them in front of you!”

Qin Yu’s heart thumped. This was what he was most worried about. If great elder used this method to force him out, the divine inscription array would be useless.

“First Elder, I’m right in front of you. If you can’t Catch Me, who else can you blame?”Qin Yu coldly asked.

“Aren’t you afraid that the world will laugh at you for doing this?”

The first Elder’s face sank as he replied, “If I can’t catch you, then I’ll be laughed at. Either you come out yourself, or I’ll kill them all!”

Qin Yu’s expression didn’t look too good, and the first elder seemed to have grabbed onto Qin Yu’s weak spot as he continuously spat out vicious words.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and looked at the Great Elder. He sneered and said, “Okay, I’ll come out.”
