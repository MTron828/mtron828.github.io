1844 Overpowering Everyone

“This… How could this be?” The eyes of the Tong family’s cultivator widened, and cold sweat flowed down his cheeks.

At this moment, Qin Yu moved.

Qin Yu raised his finger and pointed forward lightly.

A ray of golden internal qi shattered everything and arrived in an instant!

The cultivator’s face was ashen, but it was too late to escape.

“Crack!”

With a crisp sound, the internal qi brushed past his cheek and then fell on the magical artifact in his hand, shattering it along the sound.

The remaining power of this internal qi shook his face, and it hurt as if the bones in his face had been shattered!

What a terrifying strength!

It was the only thought on his mind at this moment!

Even though they were both at the Reversion Void Stage, he found himself completely defenseless in front of Qin Yu!

“Is this… a heaven’s favorite of the era…” A sense of powerlessness flashed across his heart.

This gap made him lose all his faith in an instant. His dao mind was also shattered right away at this moment.

While he was still in shock and stunned, Qin Yu walked up to him.

That powerful aura brought about an unprecedented sense of oppression.

Under this sense of oppression, he no longer had any intention to resist. His whole body trembled, and he actually knelt in front of Qin Yu.

Looking at him, Qin Yu could not help but sneer.

“I won’t kill you.” Qin Yu looked down at the man scared out of his wits in front of him.

“I want you to go back and tell the Tong family that I’m coming to settle the score with them.”

The whole of the man’s body trembled as he raised his head with difficulty. His face was covered in sweat, making him look extremely miserable.

“Yes… Yes…” he replied, trembling.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything else. He immediately got up and rushed to Nanzhou again.

At Tianyun Sect in Nanzhou, the once bustling sect had now become rather deserted.

Although most of the sects had submitted to Li Yingying, they didn’t dare to get too close to her.

There was no other reason other than the fact that Xiao Sheng had left a very deep impression in their hearts.

They had a feeling that it wouldn’t be long before Xiao Sheng returned. By then, he would definitely settle the score with everyone.

Of course, nothing was absolute. Many sects firmly believed in the Tong family behind them and became Li Yingying’s lackeys.

At this moment, Li Yingying was standing on the city wall, looking down at nearly the whole of Nanzhou.

Zhuo Jing had left an unerasable scar on her face. It was a ghastly sight, even a little scary.

Li Yingying lowered her head and looked down at Jue Wu, who was still hanging on the city wall. A vicious glint flashed in her eyes.

“Jue Wu, you really are a shocking person. After experiencing so much torture, you’re still alive,” Li Yingying said coldly.

Jue Wu’s powerful and special physique was indeed shocking.

No matter how Li Yingying tortured her, she would always be able to recover.

This made Li Yingying, who had been extremely jealous, even more upset.

“Speaking of which, if your body height was a little taller, I might have taken a fancy to you,” Li Yingying said indifferently.

“Although it’s a little short now, I can make do with it. Don’t worry. I’ll definitely ask the Tong family to give your body to me in the future.”

Hearing Li Yingying’s words, Jue Wu felt sickened. But she didn’t say anything and only snorted lightly.

Li Yingying’s face turned cold. Just as she was about to speak, a flash appeared in front of her.

Then a man in a black robe walked out. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

This person was an important figure in the Tong family. His name was Tong Shubin, and he was a trusted aide of the head of the Tong family.

Seeing Tong Shubin, Li Yingying quickly bowed and said, “Greetings, Senior Tong.”

Tong Shubin ignored Li Yingying and looked at Jue Wu hanging on the city wall.

Then, Tong Shubin reached out his palm and grabbed Jue Wu.

“Senior, what are you doing?” Li Yingying was stunned. She didn’t seem to understand Tong Shubin’s actions.

Tong Shubin glanced at her and said, “I’m bringing Jue Wu back.”

“Bringing Jue Wu back? Why?” Li Yingying asked with a frown.

Tong Shubin glanced at Li Yingying and said indifferently, “You don’t have to know,”

Li Yingying said somewhat awkwardly, “But… Young Master Tong said that he wants Jue Wu to stay in Nanzhou. You can take her away, but shouldn’t you give me a reason…”

As soon as she said that, Tong Shubin’s face instantly turned cold.

He immediately raised his hand and slapped Li Yingying’s face.

Although the slap wasn’t very hard, it caused blood to flow out of the corner of Li Yingying’s mouth.

“Give you a reason? Do you really think you’re a big shot?” Tong Shubin said coldly.

“Li Yingying, let me give you a piece of advice. Don’t think too highly of yourself.”

Li Yingying covered her face that was slapped and turned red with her hand, not daring to say a word more.

“Huh, a servant is a servant. You will never be a master…” Jue Wu said sarcastically.

A hint of hatred flashed across Li Yingying’s face, but she had no choice but to endure it.

Tong Shubin didn’t stay any longer. He took Jue Wu and turned to leave.

After Tong Shubin had gone afar, Li Yingying seemed to have gone crazy and non-stop screaming.

Her appearance looked extremely crazy, and with her disfigured face, she looked even more terrifying.

The surrounding people didn’t dare to get close for fear of suffering a disaster.

It went on like this for some time before Li Yingying gradually calmed down.

At the same time, Qin Yu arrived in Nanzhou.

He was not aware of the current situation in Nanzhou. He only knew that Tianyun Sect had been taken over by the Tong family and Li Yingying.

Qin Yu walked on the streets of Nanzhou. Everything seemed to be the same as before, without much change.

To the people in Nanzhou, no matter who had the final say would not make much of a difference.

Qin Yu did not waste any time and walked quickly toward Tianyun Sect.

“Qin Yu?”

Just then, a voice called out to Qin Yu.

He turned around and saw a young man looking at Qin Yu in shock.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He looked at the young man in front of him and felt that he looked familiar. However, he couldn’t recall who he was at this moment.

“Qin Yu, you don’t remember me? I’m Zhuo Jing’s friend. We’ve had a drink at the Zhuo family,” the young man introduced himself and said.

Only then Qin Yu remembered.

“What are you doing here?” Qin Yu asked.

The young man sighed and said, “It’s a long story. The current Nanzhou… It’s a long story.”

The young man continued, “The Tong family has been looking for you, and Lord Jue Wu also…”

“I know,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“I’m going to Tianyun Sect now to save Jue Wu.”

“You?” the young man frowned and said.
