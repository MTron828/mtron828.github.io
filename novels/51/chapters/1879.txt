1880 The True Strength?

Even Qin Yu could not help but frown.

The difference in strength between the people here wouldn’t be too significant. After all, they were all top figures from all over Holy Region.

However, Si Shiyu actually defeated his opponent with a single strike. It was enough to prove his strength.

Even Qin Yu would find it difficult to do it so directly and efficiently.

“As expected of someone from the Si family. He seems to be a strong opponent.” Qin Yu squinted his eyes and looked in the direction of Si Shiyu.

Meanwhile, Si Shiyu’s gaze also fell on Qin Yu.

There was a hint of mockery and provocation in his eyes, which made people extremely uncomfortable.

“Did you see that? This is Si Shiyu’s strength,” the peak master by the side said.

Qin Yu stepped forward and said coldly, “I hope I can draw him as soon as possible.”

“I’m afraid it’ll be tomorrow,” the peak master by the side said.

“Why tomorrow?” Qin Yu owned and asked.

The peak master didn’t say much but just sized up Qin Yu.

Qin Yu bent his body and looked at himself. When he saw the injuries on his body, he finally understood what the peak master meant.

“This little injury won’t affect me,” Qin Yu said.

The peak master rolled his eyes and said, “It doesn’t affect you doesn’t mean it won’t affect others.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything else. He knew he couldn’t change the rules. Thus it was useless to say anything.

Under everyone’s gaze, Si Shiyu slowly walked down.

A burst of applause came from below, and the few elders floating in the air couldn’t help but show a hint of admiration.

“As expected of the Si family. It’s indeed shocking.”

“That’s right. This kid probably didn’t inherit the Si family’s bloodline completely, yet he has such powerful strength. I really don’t know how powerful Si Shiyue is.”

The Si family’s elder smiled without saying anything, but the pride on his face could not be concealed.

Today’s competition was much faster than expected. It had ended before the sky turned dark.

Everyone stayed in this Mystic Realm for the time being. As for the few seniors, they left the Mystic Realm one after another.

The sky was getting dark. Thunder Courtyard distributed pills to Qin Yu and the others to ensure they would be in their best condition for the competition the following day.

Qin Yu, the peak master, and the others sat on a stone bench with their eyes closed to rest. The peak master beside them said jokingly, “How was it? You must be under a lot of pressure.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and put on a smile. He shook his head and said, “I’m looking forward to it.”

If he were even afraid of Si Shiyu, how could he face Si Shiyue?

“This Si Shiyu’s cultivation realm is above yours. Thus you don’t have to feel too much pressure. Even if you lose, it’s nothing,” Jiu Xiao said from the side.

Qin Yu remained silent.

“Lose to him?” thought Qin Yu.

If he lost to this Si Shiyu, he would no longer have the possibility of competing with Si Shiyue.

They didn’t know what this battle meant for Qin Yu. Thus he didn’t say anything else.

At this time, Zhao Wan Er ran over from not far away.

She sat beside Qin Yu, sighed, and said, “Whether I fight against you or Si Shiyu tomorrow, I’m afraid it’ll be a tough battle. Speaking of which, I want to give up.”

“What’s the matter with you? Weren’t you full of confidence today? Why are you so discouraged now?” Qin Yu laughed and said.

Zhao Wan Er rolled her eyes and said, “After seeing the strength of you and Si Shiyu, I don’t think I have a chance. Unless I obtain Flower Granny’s true inheritance.”

Talking about this, Zhao Wan Er suddenly leaned forward and whispered, “If I’m not wrong, you didn’t show your full strength today, did you?”

Qin Yu was stunned and said in surprise, “How did you know?”

“I guessed,” Zhao Wan Er said with pride.

“Although we haven’t been in contact for a long time, based on my understanding of you, you definitely won’t show your full strength when you first show up.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly.

What he displayed today was not his true strength.

Not to mention the fighting word formula, the Divine Dragon Power, and so on, even the strength of Qin Yu’s true body was not limited to this.

“Sigh! I really don’t know who’s stronger between you and that Si Shiyu. Do you have any idea?” Zhao Wan Er asked.

Qin Yu shook his head. He was indeed not confident.

If they were in the same cultivation realm, Qin Yu certainly would not be afraid of Si Shiyu.

However, this Si Shiyu had reached the Advanced-stage of Reversion Void Stage! He was two realms higher than Qin Yu!

Qin Yu wouldn’t have taken an ordinary Advanced-stage of Reversion Void seriously. However, he was Si Shiyu, a descendant of the Si family who had the family’s blood flowing in his body!

If they fought, it was hard to tell who was stronger.

“I have a 60% chance of winning,” Qin Yu said.

“You’re talking so big.”

At this moment, Si Shiyu walked over from not far away.

He looked down at Qin Yu and said, “Qin Yu, I advise you not to think too highly of yourself.”

Qin Yu glanced at Si Shiyu and said, “It’s useless to say anything now. We’ll know the outcome after the fight tomorrow.”

“That’s right, Qin Yu,” Si Shiyu laughed heartily. “I’ll think of a way to put us together, so that we don’t need to waste our time in boring fights.”

“That would be great,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

“Let me also experience the strength of the other chaotic body on behalf of Si Shiyue,” Si Shiyu said.

After saying this, Si Shiyu walked away.

Looking at Si Shiyu’s back, Zhao Wan Er couldn’t help but recoil.

“This Si Shiyu isn’t simple. The internal qi he’s giving off is enough to terrify people,” Zhao Wan Er said.

“If that’s the case, you should give up as soon as possible,” Qin Yu smiled and said.

“Go to hell. Even if I can’t get first place, at least get into the top three, right? In any case, this competition doesn’t allow killing,” Zhao Wan Er said with a smile.

After all, every student in Thunder Courtyard was fresh blood and a precious treasure. They naturally did not want anyone to die.

Qin Yu leaned against the tree and didn’t say anything else. However, the figure of Si Shiyue couldn’t help but appear in his mind.

Compared to Si Shiyue, although Si Shiyu was quite arrogant, he didn’t make people feel as uncomfortable as Si Shiyue.

He didn’t know if it was because of his personality or the difference in strength between the two.

“If an opportunity arises in the future, let’s hang around in Zhongzhou together,” Zhao Wan Er suggested.

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. “After I finish this competition, I might choose to go to Zhongzhou.”

“Ah? Are you not coming back?” Zhao Wan Er said in surprise.

“Of course. I’ll come back,” Qin Yu said with a bitter smile. When I offend someone one day, I’m afraid I’ll have to run back dejectedly.”

After saying that, Qin Yu didn’t say anything else. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He leaned against the tree and slowly fell asleep.

The competition continued on the following morning.

And Si Shiyu did as he said. He arranged for them to fight against each other, and it was the first match of the day.
