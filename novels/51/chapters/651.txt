Chapter 652: Ten Thousand Demonic Statues! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu swept his gaze across the crowd, and his words were sonorous and forceful!

However, the crowd couldn’t help but laugh coldly, especially Yan Jinyao. He stood up and said with a nonchalant smile, “You are Qin Yu? In order to help your disciple, you are even willing to tell such a lie?”

“That’s right. It’s not like we don’t know Qin Yu’s strength. Furthermore, he has already died in the Immortal Slaying Sect!”

“No one can resolve the Immortal Slaying Sect’s killing formation, not even the Jingdu Martial Arts Association,” Yan Guiyi said coldly.

Qin Yu’s lips curled into a cold smile, and in the next second, he burst into laughter!

“Alright, I’ll show you my true face today!” Qin Yu shouted!

With a loud shout, golden light immediately erupted from his body!

The terrifying internal qi shattered the black robe on his body, revealing his true face!

Qin Yu’s face appeared in front of everyone!

His body was covered in golden light, and his invincible battle intent made him look imposing!

Although he wasn’t tall, he made people feel a sense of reverence!

“How is this possible?”

Seeing this scene, Yan Jinyao stood up with a bang!

He stared at Qin Yu on the round altar, and his face was full of disbelief!

Yan Jinyao was the number one person in the younger generation, so he naturally didn’t want to believe that there was someone was stronger than him!

Han Wei clenched his fists! Unknowingly, the distance between him and Qin Yu grew larger and larger!

“What’s going on? Didn’t you say that Qin Yu is dead?” Qu Xie glared at Yan Guiyi, and his expression was extremely cold.

Yan Guiyi gritted his teeth and said, “How is this possible? He was locked up in the Immortal Slaying Sect... there’s no way he could escape!”

Qu Xie took a deep breath, and his expression was unsightly.

“He’s actually Qin Yu... This kid’s potential is unimaginable. We must kill him today!” A trace of coldness flashed in Qu Xie’s eyes!

On the round altar, Qin Yu held Yan Ruoxue’s face with both hands and said in a low voice, “Ruoxue, I’ll take you out of here today. I won’t let you suffer anymore...”

Yan Ruoxue’s watery eyes were full of tears. In a short while, tears rolled down her cheeks.

“Qin Yu... you should run quickly. You’re not their match...” Yan Ruoxue sobbed.

Qin Yu tried his best to smile and said in a low voice, “You’ve been taking care of me all this time. Ruoxue, it’s time for me to take care of you.”

With that, Qin Yu slowly turned around.

Since his identity had been exposed, Qin Yu had nothing to hide.

Golden light burst out from his body, and the power of the Divine Dragon was fully displayed. The Venerable Fifth Mountain was placed on top of his head.

Buzz!

Qin Yu shook his palm and put away the bronze sword.

“Kill him now!” Qu Xie shouted angrily!

“Bring it on! I’ll kill you bastards today!” Qin Yu shouted!

He was already prepared for a big battle, and his invincible fighting spirit made people shudder!

Below the stage, the faces of the young masters of the aristocratic families were extremely unsightly!

Qin Yu, who had emerged from the bottom, was actually stronger than them now!

How could they endure this?!

“Attack!” Qu Xie said coldly.

Several black-gold robe powerhouses immediately stepped towards Qin Yu!

They relied on the protection of the Black Gold Stone to fight Qin Yu!

At a glance, there were a total of twelve black-gold robe powerhouses!

These were the strongest combat forces that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association had mobilized in recent years!

Qin Yu’s body was covered in golden light, and he was like an undefeatable god of war!

For a moment, the scene rumbled incessantly, and the sound of metal clashing was extremely ear-piercing!

Qin Yu roared repeatedly, and his blood boiled. He was fighting twelve people singlehandedly, and his golden body contained surging battle prowess!

“Bang! Bang! Bang!!”

At this moment, Qin Yu was brimming with battle intent, and he had actually forced the twelve black-gold robe powerhouses to retreat repeatedly!

Even though Qin Yu’s body was also damaged in many places, the Black Gold Stone had already caved in.

As they looked at Qin Yu’s vigorous battle stance, everyone’s expressions became increasingly unsightly.

“How could he have such strength...” Yan Jinyao stared at this scene, and his eyes were filled with disbelief!

“Qin Yu is actually the black-robed person. Unknowingly, he has already developed to such a level...” Yao Meng also muttered softly.

“Boom!”

Right at this moment, Qin Yu’s golden fist smashed into the chest of a black-gold robe powerhouse and he smashed him into the pit!

Numerous cracks appeared on the ground, and then the ground shattered!

“Bring it on!” Qin Yu shouted at the top of his lungs while roaring furiously! He was bathed in golden light and full of fighting spirit. It was as if a God had descended! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Even though his body was soaked in blood, his internal qi didn’t show any signs of weakness. Instead, the more he fought, the braver he became!

For a moment, many of the black-golden-robed men actually had the intention to retreat, and they didn’t dare to move forward anymore!

“If you guys aren’t going to make a move, then I will!” Qin Yu shouted. He stepped on the ground, and in the blink of an eye, he arrived in front of a black-gold robe powerhouse!

Crack!

Qin Yu swung his golden fist and smashed the head of a black-gold robe powerhouse!

He was killed with one slap! Everyone couldn’t help but gasp!

“Kill him quickly!” Qu Xie shouted from the side.

The black-gold robe powerhouses looked at each other, and then they retreated!

They stood together, and their bodies began to emit soaring flames.

In just a moment, their internal qi seemed to have been sucked dry, and behind them, a huge figure condensed!

“Ten Thousand Demonic Statues!” Zhuang Teng exclaimed!

“Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s Divine Rank spell, Ten Thousand Demonic Statues! I’ve finally seen it today!”

“I didn’t expect that in order to deal with Qin Yu, they would actually use Ten Thousand Demonic Statues.”

A huge figure slowly appeared, and a terrifying pressure instantly spread out!

This figure was huge!

Its terrifying internal qi made people feel waves of fear!

Qin Yu stared at this huge figure and shouted angrily, “Ten Thousand Demonic Statues? Watch me break it!”

After saying that, Qin Yu actually took the initiative to attack!

His golden fist carried an incomparably fierce power as it punched out!

That figure slowly waved his fist and collided with Qin Yu!

Compared to this figure’s fist, Qin Yu was insignificant!

That fist was almost bigger than Qin Yu’s body!

“Boom!”

At the instant of the collision, a powerful internal qi instantly exploded on Qin Yu’s fist!

In the next second, Qin Yu’s body was instantly sent flying. Like a bullet, he smashed into the ground!

“Boom!”

A huge crater was created on the ground. With just one punch, cracks appeared on Qin Yu’s body!

“As expected of the Ten Thousand Demonic Statues!” Everyone exclaimed in shock!

Following that, the huge figure clenched his fist and smashed it fiercely in Qin Yu’s direction.

One punch, two punches, three punches!

The entire ground rumbled, like there was an earthquake. The Martial Arts Academy’s buildings couldn’t withstand the force and began to crumble!
