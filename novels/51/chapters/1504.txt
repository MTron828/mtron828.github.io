Chapter 1505: Chapter 1505, just this once 

Qin Yu looked coldly in the direction of the first elder. After a while, the internal Qi around him slowly dissipated.

“Phew.”Qin Yu let out a long breath, and then said coldly, “I’ll let him go today, but only this time. Next time, no one will be able to stop him.”

Not far away, the trembling first elder finally let out a sigh of relief. His forehead was full of sweat, enough to see his fear.

Qin Yu looked at the sect master of the heavenly cloud sect and said, “You are really a contradiction. For the sake of the heavenly cloud sect, you would rather not avenge your son, but you turned around and found a good-for-nothing to manage the heavenly cloud sect...”

The first elder did not have any reaction to Qin Yu’s abuse.

“That is an internal matter of my heavenly cloud sect, and has nothing to do with you,”the sect master said coldly.

Qin Yu continued to ask, “Then let me ask you, is Your Heavenly Cloud sect planning to stay out of the Northern Lands’invasion of the Southern Province?”

“It has nothing to do with you.”The sect master’s reply was still very straightforward.

Qin Yu sneered. He could not be bothered to care about these things anymore.

“Get lost. If I meet you again, I will definitely kill you,”Qin Yu said as he looked at the first elder coldly.

The first elder didn’t dare to stay any longer. With the help of the eighteen gods, he immediately left Yin Palace.

Di Zun intended to stay by Qin Yu’s side, but was rejected by Qin Yu.

There was no other reason. To Di Zun, the Heavenly Cloud sect was more like him, at least for now.

......

After they left, Qin Yu looked at Yongji.

“Mr. Yongji, what do you want from me?”Qin Yu said expressionlessly.

Yong ji laughed and said, “How about we go to Yong Ji City for a chat?”

“If you have something to say, just say it here,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Qin Yu could use the yin-dragon vein here to not be afraid of Yong Ji.

But if they went to Yong Ji City, their lives would be uncertain.

Seeing this, Yong Ji said in a low voice, “Qin Yu, I know about the hatred between you and the Tianyun sect. Do you want to get rid of them?”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “What do you mean by that, Mr. Yong Ji?”

Yong ji directly said, “The Tianyun sect holds great power, but they don’t think about worldly affairs. Such a sect shouldn’t exist long ago.”

“I’ll tell you the truth. Sooner or later, I’ll make things difficult for the Tianyun sect. I hope you can help me!”

Qin Yu looked at Yong Ji with interest, and his face couldn’t help but look a little strange.

This Yong Ji finally revealed his purpose.

“You have so many people to help you. You Don’t need me to succeed,”Qin Yu said indifferently.

Yong Ji raised his brows and said, “Is this considered rejecting me?”

“You can understand it that way,”Qin Yu said.

Yong Ji was silent for a moment before saying, “Alright, then I won’t force you.”

After saying this, Yong Ji didn’t stay any longer and turned around to leave Yin Palace.

Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry to leave. This was probably the safest place.

It was a pity that there was no dark energy or spiritual qi here, making cultivation extremely difficult. Otherwise, this would be a good place to go into seclusion.

...

Yong Ji sped along with his two foster sons towards Yong Ji City.

“Foster father, why don’t You Kill Him? Isn’t the purpose of our trip to kill him?”asked the foster father beside him, puzzled.

Yong Ji said with a gloomy face, “This Qin Yu is definitely not simple. He can actually activate two yin dragon vein at such a young age!”

“So? With your ability, it’s easy to kill him,”said the foster son unwillingly.

Yong Ji glanced at him and said coldly, “The sect master of the Tianyun sect is stronger, so why didn’t he take action? Aren’t you afraid that there’s a trap?”

The foster son was stunned and immediately had nothing to say.

Although the sect master of the Tianyun sect hadn’t taken action for many years, he had clearly captured Qin Yu last time, but he was locked up for three days before taking action. In the end, he was rescued by a mysterious person.

Thinking about it carefully, it was indeed somewhat unreasonable.

“I even suspect that the reason he chose to enter seclusion and hand the heavenly cloud sect over to the first elder to manage is because he was afraid that something unexpected would happen and the first elder would be the scapegoat,”Yong Ji continued.

After he finished speaking, the two foster sons suddenly came to a realization.

“Foster father is still the one who thinks long-term!”The two foster sons hurriedly cupped their hands and said.

Yong Ji snorted coldly and said, “We can’t touch this Qin Yu. If we want to touch him, let the people of the northern lands do it themselves. I’ve always been the only one who makes use of others. It’s impossible for me to become someone else’s chess piece!”

Qin Yu sat at the Yin Palace for a long time. After making sure that there were no ambushes around him, he got up and returned to Mount Hua Ning.

On Mount Hua Ning, surprisingly, Wen Da and Wen Er did not drink. Instead, they strolled around the mountain gate with their hands behind their backs.

“Damn it, will something happen to this Qin Yu?”Wen Da couldn’t help but mutter.

“Shut your mouth!”Wen Er glared at him. “That kid is very lucky. What could happen to him?”

“The other party is from the Heavenly Cloud sect. Damn it, that first elder is a dirty old man. Back then, our grandfather was deceived by him,”Wen da muttered softly.

“It’s fine. Nothing will happen to Qin Yu. Don’t worry,”Wen er waved his hand and said.

Although that was the case, the two of them were still a little worried.

Seeing that the sky was gradually darkening, Qin Yu still did not come back.

“Sigh, it seems that this kid is doomed.”Wen Er sighed. Then, he took out a pot of wine from his pocket and took a sip.

“Impossible, Qin Yu... Huh? Why the F * ck are you still hiding the wine?”Wen Er glared and snatched Wen da’s wine.

Just as the two of them were fighting, Qin Yu flew over from not far away on the godly eagle.

“Sigh, Qin Yu is back!”Wen Da threw down the wine in his hand and hurriedly waved at Qin Yu.

“I told you this kid wouldn’t have any problems!”Wen Er also waved his hand.

Qin Yu’s Godly Eagle landed at the mountain gate.

He jumped down from his back and said in surprise, “You two aren’t drunk today?”

“Brat, we were just worried about you,”Wen da muttered.

“That’s right, that’s right. Since you don’t have anything to do, the two of us have to go do our business,”Wen er said.

Then, the two of them put their arms around each other and walked toward the pavilion.

Looking at their backs, Qin Yu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry for a moment.

“I have to go look for Zhuo Jing Tomorrow,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He could only ask for his help to look for the dark energy grave.

On the other side.

When the first elder was brought back to the Heavenly Cloud sect, he was already half dead.

With such a serious injury, it would be difficult for him to recover in a short while.

When the vice sect master saw this, he could not help but say in surprise, “First Elder, what... What happened to you?”

After saying this, he looked at the eighteen gods behind him and was immediately even more shocked.

“All of this was done by Qin Yu?”The vice sect master widened his eyes.

First Elder opened his mouth and wanted to speak, but he spat out a mouthful of blood.
