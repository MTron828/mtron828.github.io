1925 One Finger

“Who the f*ck are you? How dare you meddle in our Yue family’s business? You’re courting death!” The big-bellied man shouted angrily and charged at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold. He suddenly stepped forward and kicked the man’s lower abdomen.

Clutching his lower abdomen, the big-bellied man cried out in pain.

When he tried to mobilize the spiritual power in his body, he realized the power in his body had been dispersed!

!!

“You… You crippled my cultivation!” The big-bellied man’s expression was extremely ugly.

“B*stards!” Qin Yu said coldly. “If you don’t get out of here, I won’t keep any of you alive!”

Seeing Qin Yu’s strength, the big-bellied man did not dare to confront him directly. He only said a few harsh words and hurriedly got up to escape.

After they left, the miners cupped their hands to Qin Yu and said, “Thank you, Brother, for lending a hand!”

“Take your things and quickly leave,” Qin Yu waved his hand and said.

“What about you, Brother?” a cultivator asked.

“I still have some things to do,” Qin Yu shook his head and said.

“Brother, come with us. Otherwise, the Yue family will not let you off.”

“That’s right. The Yue family is considered the number one family in Serene South City. They have a huge force and are not to be trifled with.”

“I’m fine,” Qin Yu frowned and said. “You guys leave quickly.”

“Brother, I’m willing to stay behind and face this together with you!” the injured young cultivator came forward and said.

“I’m also willing!” another cultivator walked over and said.

Qin Yu opened his mouth and suddenly felt somewhat helpless.

Initially, Qin Yu didn’t want to get into trouble, but it seemed like he was already in trouble.

Knowing this group of people definitely would not leave, he did not say anything else but could only nod.

Then Qin Yu squinted his eyes, searching for the location of the hidden treasure according to her memory.

It was a kind of deduction. Although it was different from the dao technique deduction, it could be repeated in mind countless times to ensure no untoward incidents would happen.

The path Qin Yu’s father laid out for him was indeed very considerate.

As for the others, they were not as relaxed as Qin Yu. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Although they were willing to stay with Qin Yu, the longer they stayed, the more panicked they became.

It was impossible for them not to be afraid when facing the “behemoth-like” Yue family.

Qin Yu opened his eyes slightly and looked at the nervous people in front of him. Then he said calmly, “If you’re afraid, you can leave now. I can deal with it by myself.”

“No, we won’t leave…” the injured young cultivator said.

After speaking, he spat another mouthful of blood, and his face instantly turned ashen.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He was a soft-hearted person, so he could not help but sigh.

He got up and took a pill to alleviate his injuries temporarily.

“Thank you, benefactor,” the young cultivator cupped his hands and said. “If I have a chance, I will definitely repay you in the future!”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. Although this young man was passionate, he wasn’t very talented. Probably and he wouldn’t be very strong in the future.

Sitting there, he couldn’t help but feel a little melancholy.

The path of cultivation was tremendously cruel, but Qin Yu always cared about the people.

Perhaps because he had come from the bottom level, he could empathize with them easily. He also knew how rough their living environment was.

Due to various reasons, Qin Yu would occasionally take action for them, thus attracting trouble.

While Qin Yu was thinking, several internal qi approached him from not far away.

Qin Yu remained silent and closed his eyes quietly.

After a while, the group of people arrived at a mine.

This group of cultivators possessed an impressive aura and were also quite powerful. The most powerful among them was the middle stage of the Reversion Void cultivator, who was even more powerful than Qin Yu.

“Who touched my Yue family’s people?” the middle-aged man in the lead said indifferently.

Qin Yu didn’t even bother to answer him. He closed his eyes and was extremely relaxed.

“I’m asking you who touched my Yue family’s people!” The middle-aged man shouted. His voice was like rolling thunder, shattering everyone’s eardrums and causing blood to flow continuously. Only Qin Yu sat there without moving.

The middle-aged man’s eyes soon fell on Qin Yu.

He looked at Qin Yu carefully as if trying to probe his internal qi.

After he had a glimpse of Qin Yu’s cultivation realm, the middle-aged man took a step forward and said indifferently, “My friend, our Yue family has no enmity with you in the past. Why did you attack so viciously?”

Qin Yu glanced at him, sneered, and said, “Your Yue family bullied like a tyrant and took people’s lives for no reason. Why did you say I was vicious? At least I kept him alive.”

The middle-aged man frowned slightly. He seemed to think that Qin Yu had an extraordinary temperament, so he was not in a hurry to attack. Instead, he smiled and said, “May I know your name and where you came from?”

“There’s no need to probe. I’m just a rogue cultivator with no background,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

Hearing this, the middle-aged man remained cautious and said, “Looking at my friend’s temperament, you don’t look like a rogue cultivator. My name is Yue Lingdong, the Yue family’s chief steward. I wonder if my friend would do me the honor of coming to my Yue family for a chat?”

“We walk different paths. I don’t want to have anything to do with people who oppress the poor,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Yue Lingdong’s expression turned uglier. He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Young man, don’t be so arrogant. Let alone if you’re just a rogue cultivator, so what if you’re the son of an aristocratic family? You injured my family member and spoke such arrogant words. Do you think my Yue family is easy to bully?”

Qin Yu didn’t want to waste more time talking to them, so he scolded, “Get lost!”

“You’re courting death!” Yue Lingdong was completely enraged by Qin Yu. He strode forward, and thousands of techniques gathered on his body. Then he slammed his palm forward!

...

This palm had the power to topple mountains and overturn the seas. The power was dense, shaking the surrounding space until it distorted!

Qin Yu snorted coldly. He raised his finger, and a beam of golden light streaked across. With a bang, it went straight and shattered Yue Lingdong’s palm instantly!

Yue Lingdong’s palm instantly exploded into a mist of blood, and the remaining power had even forced him back. His breathing became chaotic instantly, and blood spurted out!

“How could it be?” Yue Lingdong’s expression changed!

This young kid was only at the Early-stage of Reversion Void, so how could he possess such terrifying power?

“No, this kid is definitely not a rogue cultivator!” Yue Lingdong’s brain was working at full speed. He frowned and waved his hand after a while. “Retreat!”

The group of people turned around and left without a moment’s delay.

The surrounding people were dumbfounded. They didn’t expect the powerful Yue family to leave just like that!

“They probably won’t be coming back. You guys can go now.” Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly. Just now, he had figured out the route, and it was time for him to explore the hidden treasure.

“Many thanks, benefactor!” The crowd seemed to understand Qin Yu’s identity to be extraordinary. Thus they did not stay any longer and left.
