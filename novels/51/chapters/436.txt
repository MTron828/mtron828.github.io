Chapter 437: Conversation With Old Mister Yan Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu wasn’t surprised by Old Mister Yan’s words.

He smiled and said, “There’s no need to show mercy to such an unreasonable person.”

Although he said that, it wasn’t the case.

Qin Yu, who had been an orphan since he was young, didn’t have many people he cared about, but Old Mister Yan was definitely one of them.

Thinking of Old Mister Yan, who had once stood at the peak of the world, being humiliated by such a scoundrel, Qin Yu couldn’t bear it.

“Old Mister Yan.” Qin Yu suddenly looked at Old Mister Yan.

“Huh?” Old Mister Yan’s brows twitched.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “One day, you will return to Jingdu and regain your position as head of the Yan family.”

Old Mister Yan couldn’t help but laugh and say, “I hope so.”

Speaking up to this point, Old Mister Yan said in a deep voice, “With your current ability, it’s almost impossible to bring down the aristocratic families in Jingdu.”

“Bring down the aristocratic families?” Qin Yu shook his head with a bitter smile.

“With my current ability, it’s indeed impossible. I only want to leave Jingdu with Yan Ruoxue?on the ninth of September,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Old Mister Yan was silent for a moment before saying, “Do you know the consequences of taking her away in front of the Han family and the Yan family?”

“No matter what the consequences are, I will go,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Do you know what kind of power the Yan family and the Han family can mobilize? Do you think you can take away Ruoxue in front of everyone? Is the possibility high?” Old Mister Yan said with a grave expression.

Qin Yu’s gaze instantly became incomparably cold.

“I’ve made a bet with Han Wei. If I win, he would let me take Ruoxue away,” Qin Yu said.

Old Mister Yan waved his hand and said, “Qin Yu, you’re still too naive. If you really win against Han Wei, that would be slapping the Han family’s face, and even the faces of all the aristocratic families!”

“To them, no matter what method they use, they will not let you win.”

“If you really beat Han Wei, there will only be one outcome, and that is to be group attacked until you die.”

Qin Yu’s expression instantly became even colder.

Of course, he had thought of this before.

But for the current Qin Yu, did he have any other choice?

“If that’s the case, I don’t mind going on a killing spree,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Such arrogant words made Old Mister Yan unable to hold back his laughter.

Going on a killing spree?

Could it be that he wanted to rely on himself to fight against two aristocratic families?

“Old Mister Yan, since I promised Ruoxue, I will definitely do it,” Qin Yu said.

Old Mister Yan didn’t say anything more.

He was silent for a moment, then smiled and said, “Let’s play a round of chess?”

Qin Yu was stunned, then he smiled as well.

“Okay.”

In the huge living room, Qin Yu and Old Mister Yan were studying a game of chess.

The situation on the chessboard was ever-changing, and the methods were even more unpredictable.

In just a few minutes, the two of them seemed to have started a life-long battle on the chessboard.

“I heard that you announced to the public that your dantian was crippled?” Old Mister Yan fumbled with the chess piece and asked seemingly casually.

“Yes, that’s the only way someone would come to kill me,” said Qin Yu.

Old Mister Yan jumped the “horse” in his hand across the river and said indifferently, “Have you ever considered a problem?”

“What problem?” Qin Yu raised his head and looked at Old Mister Yan.

Old Mister Yan said, “If your dantian is really crippled, then what kind of people would come to kill you?”

Qin Yu was instantly stunned.

That’s right.

During this period of time, the people who came to kill him seemed to be a bunch of losers.

He hadn’t even seen a single peak Inner Strength Grandmaster!

The strongest were only those three sixth-level Inner Strength Grandmasters!

“What you said seems to make sense.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

Old Mister Yan played with the chess pieces and said indifferently, “Someone would come to kill you because your future potential has a certain degree of threat, so they want to eliminate this threat.”

“And since you have become a cripple, who would care about you?”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “But... there are many people who want to step on me to get to the top and establish their power.”

“It’s useless.” Old Mister Yan shook his head.

“Those who have stepped into the peak of the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm are all talented and intelligent people. They either work for the various aristocratic families, or they themselves are members of aristocratic families.”

“Why would someone at this level step on you?”

Old Mister Yan paused for a moment.

He paused and said indifferently, “Of course, there will be some, but there won’t be many.”

Qin Yu fell silent.

He had never considered this question.

There were many people clamoring to get rid of him on the Martial Arts Forum, but in the end, only those three people came.

“Also, have you considered Ruoxue?” Old Mister Yan continued.

Qin Yu, his eyes filled with confusion, suddenly raised his head.

“The more trouble you make outside, the safer Ruoxue will be,” Old Mister Yan said indifferently.

Qin Yu was suddenly filled with mixed emotions.

He had actually never considered these questions.

Old Mister Yan put down the chess piece in his hand, stood up, and said, “There’s no need to?underestimate yourself. For the first thirty years, you were just an ordinary person who washed clothes and cooked. To be able to reach this stage in such a short time is already very good.”

After saying this, Old Mister Yan said, “Old people get sleepy early at night...”

That night, Qin Yu sat in the living room and didn’t fall asleep for a long time.

He had been bitterly pursuing his path of cultivation, and he had suddenly become a martial arts fanatic.

But could a martial arts fanatic bring down an aristocratic family?

In the current era, this was obviously an impossible thing.

“Old Mister Yan is right.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“Perhaps... my direction is wrong.”

Since pretending to be useless didn’t work, then he would just turn the world upside down!

What would it be like to let the aristocratic families suffer defeat?

It would probably attract even more ambitious people.

...

The next day, it was the day to head to Brightheart Island.

Old Mister Yan specially tidied up and he looked quite energetic.

As usual, Qin Yu looked like a passer-by and no one would spare him a second glance.

For Old Mister Yan, this trip wasn’t for “traveling”, as he said. In fact, it was more to expand his connections as soon as possible.

Such an opportunity couldn’t be missed.

The two of them walked out of the villa. On the sea in front of them, there was a huge and extremely luxurious cruise ship.

Qin Yu and Old Mister Yan walked toward the cruise ship together. At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly felt a strange internal qi.

One, two, three... five!

Five Inner Strength Grandmasters! And each of them was filled with intense killing intent!

“Huh?” Qin Yu looked over to the source of the killing intent.

Not long after, Qin Yu saw a familiar figure.

“Li Zinan?” Qin Yu’s lips curled into a cold smile.

“Mr. Qin.”

At this moment, Fang Yue’s voice suddenly sounded in his ears.

He saw Fang Yue and a young man slowly walking over.

“He Teng of the Central Plains?” Seeing this young man, Qin Yu’s eyes suddenly flickered.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎
