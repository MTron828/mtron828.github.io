Chapter 587: Yan Ruoxue’s Friend Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Hou Sheng was thrown to the side like a dead dog.

everyone couldn’t help but sigh.

There were many people who wanted to attack Qin Yu, but at this moment, they all gave up.

“Hou Sheng, who is ranked ninth on the ranking list, doesn’t seem to have the ability to fight back in front of Qin Yu.” Zhuang Teng sighed.

“That’s right. I’ve already said that if this guy steps into the Martial Marquis Realm, there won’t be many people who can beat him.” Chu Heng also said in a deep voice.

“When two people of different social classes come into contact with each other, there will definitely be conflicts. This experiential learning won’t be boring.”

...

Qin Yu stood alone at the door while quietly waiting for the beginning of this experiential learning.

His eyes had been staring in the direction of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, and the killing intent in his eyes wasn’t concealed.

As long as he saw the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s plaque, Qin Yu would think of Yan Ruoxue, who was suffering.

“D*mn it...” Qin Yu clenched his fists tightly.

“Mr. Qin, you have great strength.”

At this moment, a voice suddenly came from the side.

He turned around and saw that it was Yao Meng.

“Who are you?” Qin Yu sized up Yao Meng, and a hint of hostility couldn’t help but appear in his eyes.

Yao Meng smiled and said, “Mr. Qin, don’t be nervous. My name is Yao Meng, and I’m friends with Ruoxue.”

“You and Ruoxue are friends?” A trace of excitement immediately appeared in Qin Yu’s eyes.

He hurriedly looked at Yao Meng and said, “Do you have any way to save Ruoxue?”

Yao Meng said in surprise, “What happened to Ruoxue?”

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold, and he couldn’t help but gnash his teeth and say, “The Jingdu Martial Arts Association took Ruoxue and locked her in prison.”

“I don’t know what they want to do, but Ruoxue’s body is tied with all kinds of tubes.”

“Tubes?” Yao Meng frowned slightly. “That can’t be. Ruoxue is the eldest daughter of the Yan family. Why would the Jingdu Martial Arts Association do this...”

Qin Yu snorted coldly. “The Yan family is a bunch of b*stards. Why would they care about Ruoxue?”

Yao Meng chuckled. “Mr. Qin, don’t worry. I believe Ruoxue will be fine.”

Her meaningless consolation had no effect on Qin Yu.

However, out of courtesy, Qin Yu still bowed and said, “Thank you, Miss Yao.”

The two of them fell into a short silence.

At this moment, Yao Meng suddenly said, “Mr. Qin, regarding the tube you mentioned just now... I seem to have remembered something.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Qin Yu hurriedly looked at Yao Meng while waiting for her to continue.

Yao Meng said, “I once went to the library of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association and saw this technique in an ancient book.”

“Is the pipe you mentioned black and white?”

Qin Yu hurriedly nodded and said, “Yes!”

Yao Meng continued, “This is a kind of spell called Blood Oath.”

“Blood Oath?” Qin Yu froze. He was unfamiliar with this name.

“Yes, it is said that the Blood Oath is used to transfuse the special bloodline of the recipient. This bloodline usually has extremely strong power,” Yao Meng said.

“After obtaining this bloodline, you can transform yourself. You can even artificially create a group of geniuses to forcefully inherit this extremely strong bloodline power.”

Speaking up to this point, Yao Meng paused for a moment, and then asked in puzzlement, “I remember... Miss Ruoxue doesn’t seem to be a martial artist. She’s just an ordinary person, right?”

Qin Yu also frowned and said, “Yeah, why would she have an extremely powerful bloodline on her body...”

Yao Meng smiled and said, “Maybe that’s really the case. But if that’s the case, you don’t have to worry too much.”

“In order to continuously obtain this bloodline power, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association will definitely ensure Ruoxue’s safety. Of course, suffering is certain.”

Qin Yu’s expression became ambiguous.

For a moment, he didn’t know whether to be happy or angry.

The good news was that Ruoxue’s life wouldn’t be in danger, which would give Qin Yu more time.

But this suffering would last. Such cruel methods made him angry.

“Mr. Qin, I think you should be more worried about your own safety,” Yao Meng said with a smile.

She stretched out her hand and pointed at a group of people not far away. “They are all full of hostility toward you.”

Qin Yu glanced at them. Those people were the Young Masters in Jingdu’s upper-class circle.

Led by Yan Jinyao, they all cast hostile gazes at Qin Yu.

“If I was afraid of them, I wouldn’t have come,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Yao Meng only smiled and didn’t say anything.

At this moment, another young man walked over.

This young man looked extremely weak.

The internal qi on his body was concealed extremely deeply. Even Qin Yu couldn’t see through it.

“You must be Qin Yu.” The young man walked up to Qin Yu and said with a smile.

Qin Yu sized him up and said, “Who are you?”

“I’m Xiao Yuan. I’ve long heard of you. I’m glad to finally meet you today.” The young man said with a smile.

“Xiao Yuan?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

This name was somewhat familiar. He seemed to be ranked fifth on the list.

“Your talent really puts me to shame. In a year’s time, you were able to step into the Martial Marquis realm. You really make me admire you.” Xiao Yuan cupped his hands and said.

As the saying went, one should never hit a smiling person. Although Qin Yu didn’t know Xiao Yuan, he still replied politely, “Mr. Xiao, you flatter me. I’m just lucky.”

“Luck is just the humble excuse of a powerhouse. Mr. Qin, you’re too modest.” Xiao Yuan said politely.

Qin Yu nodded and didn’t say anything else.

“Mr. Qin, I’ll go over there and say hello to some people. See you later,” Xiao Yuan said with a smile.

“Okay.” Qin Yu nodded.

After Xiao Yuan left, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown and say, “He seems to be in Jingdu’s upper-class circle too.”

“That’s right.” Yao Meng nodded slightly.

“But this person has never liked to join any sort of group. He can be considered an exception among Jingdu’s Young Masters.”

Qin Yu nodded and didn’t say anything more.

People began to arrive at the square one after another. Around ten o’clock in the morning, almost everyone had arrived.

Qin Yu swept his gaze around and found several familiar figures.

Among them were He Teng and Han Wei.

Although no one divided them, everyone still couldn’t help but form two groups.

Jingdu’s upper-class circle was represented by Yan Jinyao, and the other group was full of ordinary people’s level.

They didn’t interact with each other, but there was slight hostility between them.

At 11 o’clock in the morning, the door of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association finally opened slowly.

Then, Qu Xie, Xia Hang, and Yan Guiyi walked out.

“Everyone here is a prodigy. This is a rare opportunity for all of you,” Qu Xie said kindly.

“The location of our training is an island at the border. According to the information we have, this island has excellent spiritual energy and demon beast inner cores.”

“Inner cores?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

The inner cores of demon beasts were probably the most tempting items for Qin Yu.

Qu Xie continued, “The people who went on the training last time have all entered the middle stage of Martial Marquis and hold important positions in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

“I believe that all of you here will achieve better results!”

The whole crowd was in an uproar. Even Qin Yu was tempted.

“Everyone, please calm down. Captain Yan will read out the important points later,” Qu Xie said with a smile.

Then, the three of them turned around and returned to the Martial Arts Association.

As soon as they entered the door, Qu Xie’s expression turned cold.

He looked at Yan Guiyi and said coldly, “After we get to the island, kill all the people from the lower class. Leave none of them alive!”
