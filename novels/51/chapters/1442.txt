Chapter 1443: Chapter 1,443, facing the first elder! 1 

These protectors were all elites of the Heavenly Cloud sect, but Qin Yu didn’t feel anything.

Although the current Qin Yu could only use 30% of his strength, it was more than enough to deal with these people.

What ‘all below the Almighty are ants’? This sentence didn’t apply to Qin Yu at all.

The first elder looked at Qin Yu coldly, his eyes filled with viciousness.

“You think you are invincible after recovering your spiritual power, don’t you?”The First Elder said darkly.

Qin Yu took a step forward and shouted, “You can come and give it a try!”

In an instant, the aura on Qin Yu’s body exploded! His long hair danced in the wind, and his terrifying battle intent made people tremble in fear!

This aura actually forced all the protectors around him to retreat. Some of them even went limp and almost vomited blood!

Even the first elder’s expression changed slightly.

Was this really the aura of a nascent soul stage cultivator? How could it be so terrifying?

The spectators in the distance also felt a trace of shock in their hearts.

“This Qin Yu... is really terrifying.”

“It’s hard to say who will win or lose today.”

“Hiss... Let’s wait and see.”

The first Elder’s face was as dark as water, but the aura on his body was rapidly rising.

“Little Bastard, I really want to see just how capable you are!”The first elder said coldly.

“Swoosh!”

Before he finished speaking, Qin Yu’s figure instantly arrived in front of the first elder.

Such speed caused the first elder’s expression to change drastically!

He hurriedly shot backwards, wanting to maintain some distance from Qin Yu.

Because he knew clearly that this child’s physical body was definitely not something he could compare to!

The first elder stood high up in the sky, looking coldly at Qin Yu.

But in the next second, Qin Yu took a step forward, arriving in front of the first elder in the blink of an eye!

“What a fast speed!”

This speed seemed to have penetrated through space and arrived in an instant!

Qin Yu looked at the first elder coldly and said, “Do you still think that you can pull away from me?”

Qin Yu, who had already recovered his spiritual energy, could cast any spell.

Just now, he had relied on the ‘line’formula and arrived in front of the first elder in an instant!

The ‘line’formula was a top-notch secret art. Even in the Holy Region, it was a top-notch existence!

The first elder immediately felt cold sweat flowing down his back, and a rare look of panic appeared on his face!

“Didn’t you want to see my strength? Then why did you run?”Qin Yu sneered.

The first elder immediately flew into a rage out of humiliation and shouted, “Little Bastard, don’t be too arrogant!”

After saying that, the first elder clenched his fist and stood up. Endless battle intent and DAO Arts condensed into this fist!

Qin Yu sneered, “It’s not worth mentioning.”

With that said, golden light burst forth from Qin Yu’s body as he similarly clenched his fist and charged over.

“Boom!”

The instant the two fists collided, an explosive sound was produced in the air!

The space around the two of them collapsed in large areas. The bones of the first elder’s hand were directly shattered, and fresh blood dripped down.

The powerful aura even forced him to retreat by several hundred meters. He looked extremely miserable and miserable!

Although the two of them only exchanged one punch, this punch was the embodiment of their Endless Dao Arts!

Just one punch was enough to determine the winner!

Everyone was shocked!

How did this Qin Yu do it!

He was only in the nascent soul stage, yet he easily defeated the grand elder!

Most importantly, Qin Yu could only use less than thirty percent of his strength!

If he was at his peak condition, with the support of all kinds of spells, the first elder would probably die in a single exchange!

Qin Yu opened his mouth, revealing a mouthful of white teeth.

He looked down at the first elder and said, “Perhaps it’s time for the identity of a cat and a mouse to change.”

The first elder could not contain his anger. His hair danced wildly as he raised his head and roared, as if he was on the verge of collapse!

“Little Bastard, I’m going to kill you! ! !”The Great Elder raised his head and roared furiously. His aura erupted to the extreme at this moment.

A strange phenomenon rapidly condensed behind him!

And at this moment, a protector actually took the opportunity to attack Qin Yu.

He held a sharp blade in his hand as he pierced through space and suddenly appeared behind Qin Yu. The sharp blade in his hand stabbed straight into Qin Yu’s back!

“Go to hell!”

The Protector’s face was filled with madness as he ruthlessly stabbed at Qin Yu!

But at this moment, a dazzling golden light burst out from Qin Yu’s body!

In an instant, his body seemed to be plated with a layer of golden armor, incomparably hard!

This was the sacred physique technique that Qin Yu had not used for a long time!

His body, which was originally indestructible, instantly became impregnable under the enhancement of the sacred physique technique!

“Clang!”

As expected, the sharp blade was immediately broken the moment it touched Qin Yu’s body!

The protector was stunned. He stared blankly at his palm as if he was stunned.

Before he could react, Qin Yu’s ice-cold face was already in front of his eyes.

In his eyes, this face was even more terrifying than demons and ghosts!

“Not good!”

The Protector knew something was wrong and turned around to escape!

But at this moment, Qin Yu stretched out his hand and gently pinched in his direction. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

A strong suction force immediately erupted and firmly grabbed his fleeing figure!

In the next second, he lost control of his body and shot towards Qin Yu’s direction.

“No, no! ! First Elder, save me!”The protector shouted desperately!
