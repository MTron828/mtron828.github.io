Chapter 1009: Chapter 1009, repairing the golden core 

“Continue to control the Flame!”Qin Yu reminded.

The three of them worked together to control the seven-colored flame.

The medicinal juice of the sky herb completely turned into mist and merged into it.

Qin Yu looked at the two of them and said, “Next, we will continue to increase the strength of the spiritual fire to collect the pill.”

“Yes.”

“Yes.”

The two of them agreed at the same time. They carefully controlled the flame and increased the strength bit by bit.

Soon, the three of them reached their limits!

The flame became extremely manic, as if it was dancing in a medicinal cauldron!

Such a strong spiritual fire, even if they were top alchemists, they couldn’t bear it at this moment.

Beads of sweat appeared on their foreheads, and their strength was almost sucked out.

“Hold On...”Qin Yu clenched his teeth and said hurriedly.

The other two didn’t speak, afraid that their internal Qi would leak out.

“Ah! !”Xiang Danqing raised his head and roared, pouring all his strength into the spiritual fire!

Qin Yu and the Pavilion Master were the same. This ball of fire almost sucked out all their strength!

Fortunately, hard work paid off.

The Mist in the medicinal cauldron finally began to shrink!

“Quick, put away the Flame!”Qin Yu hurriedly reminded.

This was the requirement recorded in the pill formula, and Qin Yu didn’t dare to disobey it.

The three of them looked at each other and pulled out their hands at the same time.

The three people who had lost their cohesion couldn’t help but take a few steps back.

On the other hand, the medicinal cauldron was still throbbing with seven-colored flames.

Qin Yu hurriedly got up from the ground and ran to the front of the medicinal cauldron. His eyes were fixed on the ball of flames.

The seven-colored flames did not stop burning, but the scale was decreasing.

The Fog in the medicinal cauldron was taking shape bit by bit.

“The pill is almost done!”Qin Yu said with some excitement.

Pavilion master also nodded slightly and said, “Don’t be anxious. Wait slowly.”

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude. He stood in front of the medicinal cauldron and looked at the ball of flame with eager eyes.

This ball of seven-colored flame was extremely firm, and the speed at which the pill was taking shape was extremely slow.

Half an hour passed in the blink of an eye, but the pill was still unable to take shape.

However, Qin Yu did not lose his patience. His heart was filled with anticipation. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

In the blink of an eye, another hour had passed.

The three of them stood in front of the medicinal cauldron and were about to fall asleep.

Even Qin Yu, who was incomparably excited, had lost more than half of his excitement at this moment.

“Bang!”

At this moment, a loud sound suddenly rang out from within the medicinal cauldron!

This loud sound immediately made the three of them perk up!

Qin Yu hurriedly looked at the medicinal cauldron and saw that there was a pill placed in the center of the flame.

The pill looked simple and unadorned, not at all like a top-notch pill.

“Is this the Spirit Recovery Pill? !”Qin Yu was incomparably excited.

He stretched out his hand and extended it towards the ball of flame, intending to take out the pill.

But the moment he touched the ball of seven-colored flame, an intense pain was transmitted from his finger!

“Hiss!”

Qin Yu gasped and hurriedly withdrew his hand!

He was horrified to find that this flame had directly burned the skin on his finger!

“Is this flame so terrifying?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but be greatly shocked when he saw this!

One had to know that with Qin Yu’s current physical body, even the spiritual fire would find it difficult to hurt him!

“Could it be that... the power of the flame formed by the three of us will also increase?”Xiang Danqing said in a deep voice.

“There must be records of this seven-colored flame. It must be above the Purple Flame,”pavilion master said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I agree.”

“Alright, don’t take the chestnuts out of the fire. Let’s wait.”Pavilion master patted Qin Yu’s shoulder.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “This is the only way.”

Time passed by minute by minute. The Flames in the medicinal cauldron began to disappear bit by bit.

Only after two of them disappeared did the seven-colored flames completely disappear.

Qin Yu grabbed the spirit recovery pill and looked at it excitedly.

“Is this the Spirit Recovery Pill? This small pill can really repair my golden pill?”Qin Yu felt that it was somewhat magical.

The problem that had troubled Qin Yu for a long time was actually solved by such a small pill!

“There’s nothing strange about it. Many people who suffer from illness and pain also only need one pill,”said the pavilion master.

Qin Yu agreed. He stroked the pill and then said in a low voice, “I’ve finally waited for this day.”

After saying that, Qin Yu looked at the pavilion master and Xiang Danqing, cupped his hands and said, “Seniors, I’m afraid I’ll need you to protect me from now on.”

“Don’t worry. I’ve been here for more than 30 years, and no one has ever come here before,”Xiang Danqing said.

“Okay, then I’m relieved.”Qin Yu held back the excitement in his heart.

He opened his mouth and swallowed the spirit recovery pill into his stomach!

The moment the pill fell into his stomach, traces of extremely gentle internal Qi exploded in Qin Yu’s Dantian!

This internal Qi continued to circulate in Qin Yu’s Dantian and finally gathered on his golden core!

The internal Qi poured into the cracks in Qin Yu’s golden core like a surgeon, slowly repairing Qin Yu’s golden core!

Qin Yu closed his eyes and decorated his dantian.

He was shocked to discover that the golden core was indeed recovering!

Such a large crack actually disappeared bit by bit!

“Spirit Recovery Pill... it can indeed repair my golden core!”

At this moment, Qin Yu was incomparably excited!

As long as the golden core was repaired, he would be able to officially welcome the martial saint’s Heavenly Tribulation!

Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the ground. He held his breath and condensed his internal Qi, using his divine sense to control this bit of Aura.

The speed of the Golden Core’s repair was extremely slow. According to this speed, it would probably take at least a day and a night.

Qin Yu was not in a hurry. He had already spent so much time, so he naturally did not care about a day and a half.

Pavilion master and Xiang Danqing were waiting by the side. During their leisure time, the two of them did not forget to bicker.

“This disciple of yours really has some skill. He has such ability at such a young age,”Xiang Danqing said indifferently.

Pavilion master said in a deep voice, “Actually, he is not really my disciple. He is just an elder of My Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

Xiang Danqing sneered and said, “I knew it. How could you possibly have such a good disciple?”

Pavilion master glanced at him, as if he was too lazy to argue with him.

“But... This Qin Yu looks a little like your dream lover.”Xiang Danqing said half-jokingly and half-seriously.
