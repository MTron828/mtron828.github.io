Chapter 322: Yan Sihai’s Intentions Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The car window slowly rolled down. Then, a man with a strong and imposing figure beckoned at Qin Yu.

This man was none other than Yan Sihai.

He held a cigar in his hand and said indifferently, “Come and have a chat.”

Qin Yu wasn’t surprised. He guessed that Yan Sihai would definitely look for him.

Therefore, Qin Yu turned around and got into the car.

After he got in, the car sped off into the distance.

Qin Yu said politely, “Mr. Yan, why are you looking for me?”

Yan Sihai blew out a smoke ring. He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “You are quite bold. You even dare to covet the people of the Yan Family?”

Qin Yu guessed what he was going to say, so he replied with a smile, “Mr. Yan, it is my right to pursue Yan Ruoxue.”

“Right? Are you, a bottom-level person, even qualified?” Yan Sihai said in a cold voice.

Qin Yu said in a neither servile nor overbearing manner, “I think people should not be divided into upper and lower ranks. I believe that Miss Yan thinks so too.”

“People are divided into upper and lower ranks, whether you admit it or not.” Yan Sihai took a puff of his cigar and said indifferently.

Qin Yu was silent.

In this world, people were indeed divided into different levels.

Updates by

Those without money would always subconsciously feel inferior to those with money.

Those with money would also do the same when facing those with power.

And these so-called upper class people seemed to think that this was natural.

“The essence of society is exploitation,” Yan Sihai said nonchalantly.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “I don’t think so. Even if it’s true as you said, everything is changing.”

“I’m not here to reason with you,” Yan Sihai said nonchalantly.

“Because you and I aren’t on the same level, I don’t need to reason with you.”

Yan Sihai waved his hand, and the person beside him immediately handed over a document.

Yan Sihai threw the document to Qin Yu and said, “I can give you a sum of money and a better identity. Open it and take a look.”

Qin Yu didn’t take the document. Instead, he asked, “Mr. Yan, what are your conditions?”

“Leave Yan Ruoxue and never enter the Yan family’s home again!” Yan Sihai said coldly.

Hearing this, Qin Yu immediately pushed the document back.

“Sorry, I refuse.” Qin Yu shook his head and said.

Yan Sihai smiled nonchalantly and said, “Don’t you want to know what’s inside?”

“No matter what it is, I’m not interested,” Qin Yu said calmly.

Yan Sihai sneered and said, “The things inside are enough for you to dominate an area! You can live a carefree life! Are you really not tempted?”

“Nothing is more important than Yan Ruoxue,” said Qin Yu.

Yan Sihai’s expression instantly turned cold.

He narrowed his eyes and said, “Do you know that if a person isn’t greedy, it is easy for him to get himself killed?”

“I will ask you one last time. Are you sure you don’t want it?” Yan Sihai’s voice became colder and colder.

“No,” Qin Yu answered straightforwardly.

Yan Sihai didn’t say anything more. He nodded and said, “Okay, let’s drive.”

The car arrived at a desolate mountain range. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

In this desolate mountain range, there were already two people waiting for them.

The car slowly came to a stop. Yan Sihai glanced at Qin Yu and said, “It’s not too late for you to regret now.”

“I have nothing to regret.” Qin Yu’s determined tone made Yan Sihai very unhappy.

He didn’t like the resistance of the people at the bottom, and he also didn’t like people with low statuses to challenge him.

Because in Yan Sihai’s eyes, this was a great disrespect.

“Qin Yu, you and Yan Ruoxue aren’t compatible at all. Why must you insist?” Yan Sihai said with a cold smile.

“Then who do you think is compatible? Han Wei of the Han family? Because the Han family can help you secure the position of the Patriarch of the Yan family, right?” Qin Yu said with a cold smile.

These words thoroughly infuriated Yan Sihai!

He said coldly, “You can scram now.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the two people outside walked over.

They opened the car door, bowed, and said, “Mr. Yan.”

Yan Sihai didn’t even look at them and said indifferently, “Remember, don’t kill him.”

“Please rest assured, Mr. Yan,” the two people said respectfully.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything and got out of the car.

After Qin Yu got out of the car, Yan Sihai left.

The surroundings were cold, dark, and windy. It was a good place to kill people.

The two of them looked at Qin Yu and said coldly, “Don’t worry, we won’t make you feel much pain.”

After saying that, the two of them reached out their hands toward Qin Yu!

Four palms were moving towards Qin Yu’s dantian at an extremely fast speed!

“Clang!”

The palms fiercely grabbed onto the position of Qin Yu’s dantian!

However, the scene of flesh being torn apart didn’t appear! Instead, their fingers shook until they were in pain!

“It seems that Yan Sihai doesn’t know me very well.” Qin Yu lowered his head to look at the two killers and said expressionlessly.

The two of them secretly felt that something was wrong and hurriedly moved away!

Qin Yu looked at the two of them coldly and said, “Two third level Inner Strength Grandmasters? Aren’t you guys being sent to your deaths?”

The Yan family controlled an unknown number of top Inner Strength Grandmasters, and they could even invite people that surpassed Inner Strength Grandmasters!

But the assassins sent by Yan Sihai were actually two good-for-nothings!

It really made him laugh his head off!

“Today is probably the last time you guys will work for Yan Sihai.” Qin Yu didn’t have the slightest bit of pity in his heart.

He took a step forward, and a golden light instantly lit up the sky!

“Clang!”

Two crisp sounds rang out, and Qin Yu’s fists pierced through their chests!

With the support of the mysterious force, the strength of Qin Yu’s physical body had become many times stronger!

Two Inner Strength Grandmasters were simply not a threat!

After killing these two people, Qin Yu extended his palm, and the spiritual fire immediately landed on their bodies.

In a short few minutes, the two corpses disappeared.

Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry to leave.

He stood alone in the wilderness, and there was no expression on his face.

“The Yan family...” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

His enemy wasn’t just Han Wei, but perhaps all the top-tier aristocratic families.

The division of class had put these top-tier aristocratic families into the same camp.

They could fight among themselves, but they would never allow anything like crossing classes to happen.

Qin Yu turned around and left. Lightning flashed and thunder rumbled in the sky at this moment, as if it was a sign of something.
