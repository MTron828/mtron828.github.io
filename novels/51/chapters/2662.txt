Chapter 2663: Hua Tian and Evil Buddha

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu gazed down at the mundane realm below. At this moment, he once again felt the vastness of this area. To witness a nation emerging within a sect was truly a first for him.

Just how expansive was this Saint Kingdom? Qin Yu found himself somewhat awestruck.

Moreover, it was important to note that this Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom was the weakest among the many Saint Kingdoms. If that was the case, he couldn’t even begin to imagine the spectacle of those powerful Saint Kingdoms.

At this moment, within the Ancient Demon Land, traversed by a corpulent monk.

Numerous ancient demons lay defeated beside him. These ancient demons, unsealed, possessed formidable strength.

Most of these ancient demons had already reached the pinnacle of Human Consciousness, with many having even grasped the concept of force.

Yet, in the presence of Hua Tian, these ancient demons appeared as mere children, utterly incapable of resistance.

“With the might of the Great Expansion Divine Technique, this realm is where my grand cosmic luck lies. Hence, I cannot afford to miss this opportunity. For when cosmic luck peaks, decline follows, as seen with Qin Yu. Cosmic luck always has its ebb.”

Hua Tian pondered silently. Suddenly, an ancient demon lunged towards him.

Energy coalesced behind him, forming a vast space of fluctuating energies.

The Fist of the Great Expansion Divine Technique surged forth from this energy, its ferocious aura crushing the surrounding ancient demons into submission.

Saint Power surged into his body, radiating golden light.

This Saint Power traversed his body, causing Hua Tian’s skin to visibly ripple.

“At last, I’ve reached my limit. However, it seems my Great Expansion Divine Technique has undergone further evolution.”

Hua Tian chuckled. He had battled in the Ancient Demon Realm for quite some time now.

At this juncture, his Saint Power was abundant. He could bolster areas of strength to their utmost limit without concern for their quantity. This was a prospect unimaginable to him before.

After attaining a certain strength in his divine soul and re-comprehending the power of the Great Expansion Divine Technique, his prowess surged tremendously.

Furthermore, the power of the Great Expansion Divine Technique belonged to this Saint Kingdom. Its consumption upon his person was minimal, allowing him to sustain his battle here for an extended duration.

“Amitabha. Honored guest, you have ventured into my domain. I implore you to depart swiftly.”

Before Hua Tian, a statue of Buddha suddenly materialized.

With its appearance, the atmosphere turned ominously cold, suffused with an aura of malevolence and dread.

If Qin Yu were here, he would surely recognize this as the Evil Buddha who previously slew Zi Xia, a formidable presence.

“Evil Buddha, Molou Shura, hahaha! So, you’ve been suppressed within the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom. No wonder I haven’t heard from you for so long,” Hua Tian chuckled.

Molou Shura was among the earliest saints in the birthplace of Buddhism, reigning atop the realm of desires as the lord of the 3,000 realms.

However, as his power grew, so did his ambition. Dissatisfied with the status of a saint, he sought to break through to the Divine Realm, ultimately invoking divine punishment and disappearing without a trace.

The tale of his ambitions was well-known within the Buddhist Sect, but none had expected him to be suppressed within this Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom.

“Roar!”

As if provoked by Hua Tian’s arrogance, the Buddha statue let out a furious roar.

In an instant, it sprouted two additional heads and four arms.

With a sweeping motion, all six arms attacked simultaneously, unleashing a terrifying force of destruction upon Hua Tian.

The overwhelming power carried the scent of sulfur. Molou Shura, also known as the God of Destruction, possessed a destructive force akin to that of a volcanic eruption.

“Excellent! I’ll use you to gauge my current strength!” Hua Tian thought.

Hua Tian showed no respect. The kasaya on his back seemed to come alive, swirling around his body on its own.

Then, with a sudden motion, he rolled it up to block the six arms. The scriptures on the kasaya danced like a swarm of tadpoles.

These runes emerged from the kasaya like individual living beings, gradually revealing themselves.

Against this destructive force, the kasaya burst forth with golden light, directly blocking the attack.

Demon-Subduing Kasaya, Demon-Subduing Scripture.

Hua Tian laughed heartily as he recited the scriptures.

The kasaya expanded with the wind, enveloping the Buddha statue directly.

The runes on the kasaya once again emitted a blinding golden light, encircling the Buddha statue as if they intended to sever it completely from its true body.

“You’re asking for death!”

A cold, stern voice echoed forth as a solemn living being of the Buddha statue with its eyes closed suddenly materialized in front of Hua Tian. It bore the peculiar form of an eagle’s head atop a human body, a sight both strange and unsettling.

In its grasp, the massive right hand held an eyeball, which it consumed with an eerie relish.

“It’s said that the God of Destruction, Molou Shura, has a penchant for consuming human eyeballs. It appears the rumors hold.”

Hua Tian observed, carefully studying the founder of Buddhism before him. In the lower realms, he might not have dared to even lift his gaze, but within this Saint Kingdom, fear did not grip him.

Before this journey, no danger had been detected within cosmic luck,

indicating that even this Evil Buddha posed no mortal threat.

After finishing the eyeball, the Evil Buddha wiped the corner of its mouth and grinned at Hua Tian.

“Kneel or face death.”

In its palm, a string of prayer beads materialized out of thin air.

The moment he held it, a Buddhist light erupted from his palm.

Before Hua Tian could reply, a fist with Buddhist light had already smashed out.

Buddha Light Shine!

With one punch, the kasaya was torn apart and the Buddha statue returned to Shura’s back.

“I’ll offer you a choice as well. Kneel and submit to me, or perish,” Hua Tian said, patting his belly with a genial smile.

Buddha Light Shine!

Molou Shura punched again, and the Buddha statue appeared in front of Hua Tian as if it had teleported.

Six massive fists, imbued with the power of Buddhist light, descended upon Hua Tian once more.

The devastating force struck Hua Tian’s body. Beneath the intense heat, his body became charred and emitted a foul smell.

Angry Buddha Lotus Flame!

A flame erupted suddenly in Hua Tian’s hand.

The flame detonated in his palm, unleashing boundless flames. The tremendous explosive force pushed the Buddha statue away.

“Oh? There’s something.”

Molou Shura revealed a surprised smile, seemingly astonished that Hua Tian could withstand the attack.

“I’m tired of playing. Go to hell.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

However, this look of surprise only lasted for a moment before his body abruptly turned blood red.

The entire eagle’s head exuded an immensely furious aura, and waves of heat swept through the air as if they had sensed his anger.

An overwhelming sense of danger surged in Hua Tian’s heart, and he shouted furiously..
