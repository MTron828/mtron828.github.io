Chapter 925: Chapter 925, rumors about the secret realm of the Yan family

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, the secret realm of the Yan family.”

Then, Qin Yu told the handlebar mustache what happened to him in the secret realm.

After hearing it, the handlebar mustache’s face suddenly became gloomy.

“What’s Wrong?”Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown and ask.

The handlebar mustache said in a low voice, “It seems that the rumors are true.”

“What rumors?”Qin Yu hurriedly asked.

The Mustache Man looked at Qin Yu and said seriously, “When I was traveling, I once saw an ancient book that recorded many rumors, including the Yan family.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything and waited for the follow-up of the Mustache Man.

The mustache man said, “According to the records in that ancient book, the Yan family is an ancient family that has been passed down for many years. As for their strength, no one knows.”

“A long time ago, I suspected that the Yan family in Jingdu was most likely one of their branches. Now it seems that it is very likely to be true.”

Qin Yu also said in a low voice, “Old Mister Yan also said before that he heard my father... heard others mention that Yan Ruoxue might be someone with the complete bloodline of the Yan family.”

“At that time, old Mister Yan and I didn’t quite believe it, because if the Yan family was really so powerful, when Yan Ruoxue was being bullied, they never showed up.”

“Now it seems that the Yan family probably didn’t discover Yan Ruoxue’s bloodline until she stepped into the path of cultivation.”

The mustached man nodded slightly in agreement to this guess.

“Is this secret realm of the Yan family really that powerful?”Qin Yu asked.

The mustached man nodded and said, “If the rumors are true, then they are very likely to be the top existences in the GU family.”

“It’s said that their purest bloodline possesses extremely powerful strength.”

“I now suspect that even the secret realm of the Yan family doesn’t have the complete bloodline of the Yan family. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have come to take Yan Ruoxue away.”

Qin Yu said somewhat suspiciously, “Then why didn’t they take action to destroy the Jingdu Martial Arts Association? or those secret realms that Oppress Yan Ruoxue?”

“How would I know if you ask me?”The Mustache Man rolled his eyes.

“You’ve seen it. The people they sent to pick up Yan Ruoxue are all at the Almighty Realm. As for how powerful their clan is, I don’t even dare to imagine it.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but suck in a cold breath. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

That’s right. Even the two people who came to pick up Yan Ruoxue were at the Almighty Realm. Then, how many peak cultivators did their clan have?

“Where is the Yan family’s secret realm?”Qin Yu asked.

“I don’t know.”The mustached man shook his head.

“But I can be sure that their secret realm is absolutely different from what we know.”

Qin Yu also agreed with this.

A family with such strength couldn’t possibly hide in a small world like the second secret realm.

“These are too far away from us. However, I have to remind you that if the rumors are true, then in front of the Yan family, your advantage as a primal chaos body isn’t worth mentioning.”The mustached man said.

Qin Yu sighed slightly.

Of course, he had long realized this matter, but what could he do? He could only take it one step at a time.

...

The conference was getting closer and closer, and countless martial artists of the current era were seriously injured.

For a moment, the entire martial arts world was filled with sorrow.

At this moment, they could not help but Miss Qin Yu.

“If Qin Yu was here, he would definitely be able to take care of them!”

“Yeah, with Qin Yu’s personality, he would definitely not allow these mystic realm disciples to be arrogant!”

“Sigh, when the mystic realm appeared, Qin Yu and Yan Jinyao actually disappeared. I really want to see if Yan Jinyao can defeat them.”

“Yan Jinyao... He is the number one disciple in the world. With him around, it might really be possible.”

Looking at these comments, Qin Yu could not help but sneer.

Yan Jinyao?

He had obtained 80% of Yan Ruoxue’s bloodline. He was indeed extremely powerful.

However...

How could a selfish person like him offend others?

This matter had nothing to do with him. This was Yan Jinyao’s style of doing things.

Qin Yu picked up his phone. His heart was a little chaotic.

That night.

In a secret room of the Yan family, a young man slowly opened his eyes.

The door of the secret room slowly opened.

Then, Yan Jinyao walked out of the secret room.

The two warriors of the Yan family guarding the door hurriedly came up to greet him.

“Congratulations to young master Yan for coming out of closed-door cultivation,”the two said in unison.

Yan Jinyao put his hands behind his back and looked indifferent.

His every move carried a powerful internal Qi.

“Young Master Yan, May I know what realm you have entered?”A martial artist beside him asked.

Yan Jinyao said indifferently, “There is only a thin line between you and a martial saint.”

The two martial artists immediately shouted, “Congratulations, Young Master Yan, for entering the half-step martial Saint Realm!”

“Half-step martial saint?”Yan Jinyao could not help but Snicker.

“I am not an ordinary half-step martial saint. The benefits that the Yan family bloodline has brought me... are beyond my imagination!”

A trace of confidence and madness flashed across Yan Jinyao’s face!

He felt the power that filled his body and his face became even more excited!

That night, Yan Sihai held a celebration banquet for Yan Jinyao.

During the banquet, Yan Jinyao also had a general understanding of the current situation in the world.

“This means that the martial arts world has been occupied by martial artists from the Secret Realm?”Yan Jinyao’s eyes narrowed slightly.

Yan sihai nodded and said, “Yes, there has been a lot of support for you on the martial arts forum recently.”

Hearing this, a trace of pride could not help but appear on Yan Jinyao’s face.

“Of course, Qin Yu’s support is even higher.”At this time, Yan Sihai added another sentence.

Hearing this, Yan Jinyao’s face instantly turned cold.

He clenched his fist and said coldly, “A bunch of ants, and they still want me to save them. It’s really... ridiculous!”

The Butler next to him suggested, “Young Master Yan, their lives are of course not worth mentioning, but if you make a move now, you will definitely win the hearts of the people.”

“Recently, under Gu Xinghe’s leadership, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association has lost the hearts of the people. If we are willing to invest now, we might be able to replace the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”

Yan Jinyao looked at the butler, his eyes slightly narrowed, and no one knew what he was thinking.
