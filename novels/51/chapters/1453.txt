Chapter 1454: Chapter 1,454, people of the northern lands

The surroundings were silent.

Qin Yu had relied on his powerful strength to actually control this killing formation to explode in mid-air.

Otherwise, the entire palace would have been destroyed.

The city Lord’s face was filled with gloom, and his heart was trembling with fear.

Just one punch had shattered this killing formation. This was enough to prove that Qin Yu was not someone he could afford to provoke.

The city Lord took a deep breath. With a shake of his feet, he arrived in front of Qin Yu.

Following that, the city Lord asked in a deep voice, “What exactly do you want?”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows. He raised his hand and patted the city Lord’s shoulder, saying, “Don’t worry. I just want sister Lin to stay with you. Of course, not only do you have to ensure her safety, you also have to serve her well.”

The city Lord looked at sister Lin and couldn’t help but feel relieved.

To a palace, it was nothing at all.

“No problem,”said the city lord.

If he had known it was such a small matter, he wouldn’t have made such a fuss.

“Sister Lin, you can stay here from now on and treat this place as your own home. If you need anything, just tell him,”said Qin Yu.

Sister Lin seemed a little unnatural, but it was Qin Yu who fought for it, so she couldn’t refuse, so she nodded and agreed.

“City Lord, I have to warn you. If anything happens to sister Lin, I will definitely make you lose your head,”Qin Yu said with a sneer.

The city lord frowned. He put his hands behind his back to maintain the dignity of the city lord.

But the words from his mouth were extremely weak.

After settling sister Lin Down, Qin Yu turned around and left.

He summoned the Divine Eagle and rushed in the direction of the Heavenly Cloud sect.

Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the Divine Eagle and rushed towards the Heavenly Cloud sect.

After traveling for two days, Qin Yu, who was cultivating on the divine eagle, suddenly felt two waves of killing intent approaching.

Qin Yu opened his eyes and looked forward.

He saw two people wearing tight-fitting clothes and their faces were covered. They were rushing forward.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. His eyes couldn’t help but look at these two people.

These two people seemed to have noticed Qin Yu’s gaze. In the next second, they directly shot toward Qin Yu.

“Pa da.”

These two people’s bodies landed on the back of the Godly Eagle.

They sized up Qin Yu and said coldly, “He’s only a nascent soul stage cultivator.”

“Maybe he’s a young master from a certain family,”said the other person.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and looked at the two uninvited guests. He was a bit displeased.

“Kid, Lend Us Your Godly Eagle. We’re on our way,”one of them said to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu looked at him coldly and said, “What does it have to do with me whether you’re on Your Way or not?”

Their expressions changed and they said coldly, “It seems that our words are not clear enough. Well, let me tell you, Your Divine Hawk belongs to us.”

“Why are your faces so Big?”Qin Yu stood up from the Divine Hawk.

Seeing Qin Yu’s leisurely and self-satisfied expression, the two of them could not help but snort coldly and say, “Kid, no matter what background you have, it’s not enough in our eyes.”

“Either you get lost now, or we will kill you. Choose for yourself.”

Qin Yu looked coldly at the two of them and said, “What if I don’t choose?”

“Then you are courting death!”One of them shouted loudly, his hand holding a radiance as he charged towards Qin Yu!

“Clang!”

His fist smashed firmly onto Qin Yu’s chest, emitting a deafening sound. The radiance in his hand was also instantly dispersed!

On the other hand, Qin Yu stood there unmoving, like a rock.

“How is this possible!”The two of them immediately felt that something was wrong and turned around to run.

“You want to leave after coming here?”Qin Yu sneered. He waved his hand, and a golden palm directly slapped onto their bodies! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

With just one slap, the bodies of the two of them were almost shattered, and fresh blood flowed out!

If it wasn’t for the fact that the divine eagle was large enough, they would have already fallen ten thousand meters into the sky!

Qin Yu walked towards the two of them. He looked coldly at the two of them and said, “Snatching my things? I think you two are tired of living.”

Just as Qin Yu was about to get rid of these two people, another figure shot over from not far away!

In the blink of an eye, he had already landed in front of Qin Yu.

Looking at the person in front of him, Qin Yu frowned slightly and said with slight surprise, “Senior Xiao Hai? Why are you here?”

Xiao Hai also said with some surprise, “Qin Yu? We meet again.”

Then, he pointed at the two men in tight clothes and said, “I’m here to look for them. I didn’t expect that they would fall into your hands. Thank you very much.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “I don’t know who they are at all. They are the ones who insisted on snatching my things...”

Xiao Hai laughed out loud and said, “That’s really a coincidence. Everything is God’s will.”

After saying that, Xiao Hai walked in front of the two men. He raised his hand and lifted the two men up.

“Tell me, who exactly are you people?”Xiao Hai said coldly.

These two people parted their mouths and said with a cold smile, “Xiao Hai... when our northern land attacks, the first person to be killed will be you!”
