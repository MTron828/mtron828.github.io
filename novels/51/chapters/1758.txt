1759 Comprehending the Great Dao

When Xiao Hai used this technique, he was determined to die. He wanted to drag the entire North Plain down with him!

Now that he had used this technique again, it was obvious that he no longer had any thoughts of living!

Not only Qin Yu, but Sima Bei and the others also saw through this technique!

The few of them hurriedly retreated and shouted, “Master, you must be careful of this technique!”

However, how could Yuan Xiu be afraid? He had the Immortal Slaying Sect’s secret technique and a realm that could crush Xiao Hai. He had no fear at all!

“Come, let me see your final technique!” Yuan Xiu shouted.

He raised his palm and the scene behind him exploded with thousands of wisps of energy that rushed toward Xiao Hai.

Xiao Hai raised his hands and made a gesture of supporting the sky. At that moment, he seemed to have formed a connection with the dark clouds in the sky!

Countless auras condensed in his palm, and more than ten golden dragons appeared in the sky. Each golden dragon was vivid and lifelike, as if they had fused with the Great Dao of heaven and earth!

Their techniques were about to collide at any time. Qin Yu stood in the distance, extremely anxious!

“This time, no matter what, we must let Senior Xiao Hai live!” Qin Yu’s face was pale, and his forehead was dripping with sweat!

Qin Yu’s eyes were slightly closed, and an anxious expression filled his face. He seemed to be thinking about something!

He forced himself to calm down and try to sense the Great Dao of heaven and earth. He wanted to sense something at this critical moment!

Xiao Sheng was able to comprehend the Great Dao of heaven and earth and cast a technique that was as powerful as the world! Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Xiao Hai was the same. He used the power of heaven and earth and his strong faith to cause heavy damage to the North Plain!

Now, Qin Yu also wanted to learn something from it. Even if it could not play a key role, it could at least save Xiao Hai’s life!

“Boom, boom, boom!”

A terrifying boom reverberated throughout the world.

And Xiao Sheng’s heavenly tribulation had also descended as expected!

The heavenly tribulation was more terrifying than anyone could imagine, as thick bolts of lightning struck Xiao Sheng’s body!

“Xiao Hai, go to hell!”

Yuan Xiu roared and the thousands of wisps of aura slashed at Xiao Hai.

Xiao Hai raised his head and roared. He waved his sleeves and struck out with his palms, charging towards Yuan Xiu!

Qin Yu closed his eyes tightly, trying his best to sense something.

“Boom!”

At this moment, the spells collided.

The terrifying shock wave swept out, and everyone was affected!

Even Sima Bei, Yong Ji, and the others were sent flying, blood flowing out of their mouths!

Not only them, but Jue Wu, Qu Zhu, and Wen Wanchong also suffered the same terrible impact. Their bodies almost shattered and blood flowed out!

The entire world seemed to have turned into a terrifying storm, and no one could escape!

However, on this terrifying battlefield, Qin Yu’s body did not move at all!

His body was not affected at all!

“What?”

Qu Zhu and the others were the first to discover this scene.

They looked at Qin Yu in surprise, only to see a golden light emerging around him.

The light enveloped him and actually avoided the storm!

“What’s going on?” Wen Wanchong swallowed his saliva, feeling extremely shocked!

The impact just now had almost killed them, let alone almighty realm cultivators!

But Qin Yu was not affected at all? He wasn’t even shaken at all!

“This kid... What did he learn?” Qu Zhu said in a low voice.

Before they could figure out the situation, the killing intent was already directed at Xiao Hai!

As expected, even Xiao Hai’s trump card could not shake this Yuan Xiu’s move!

Everything was annihilated, and Xiao Hai’s body was forced back hundreds of steps.

Even if he was incomparably strong, he also appeared to be in a sorry state at this moment!

The gap between realms was difficult to make up for!

“Xiao Hai, you’re dead!”

Yuan Xiu roared. His hands moved, and the terrifying vision above his head suddenly reached out with one hand!

The hand was aimed at Xiao Hai, and Xiao Hai’s body was suddenly sent flying toward the scene.

Once Xiao Hai was swallowed into this scene, he would also become part of the combat power of this scene.

In other words, Xiao Hai would lose his self-consciousness due to this technique!

This was the terror of the Immortal Slaying Sect. They could turn anyone into their own combat power!

Seeing Xiao Hai’s body being gradually swallowed by the scene, everyone became anxious.

“I have to think of a way to save him!” Jue Wu anxiously said.

Her body emitted a purple glow as she planned to rush forward to save Xiao Hai.

However, the aura exuded by that scene was too terrifying. Not to mention getting close, just taking a few steps forward would cause one to vomit blood from the terrifying impact!

Jue Wu wasn’t willing to give up. She rushed towards that scene a second time.

This time, she was directly sent flying, and she even spat out a mouthful of blood!

“Motherf*cker!”

Wen Wanchong and Qu Zhu also tried to get closer, but the result was even worse than Jue Wu’s. Their bodies were almost shattered, and their auras were extremely weak!

“What kind of technique is this? I can’t even get close to him...” Wen Wanchong’s face was filled with despair.

Was he going to let Xiao Hai die in front of everyone for the second time?

He was unwilling to accept this!

“Xiao Sheng, hurry up and break through!” Wen Wanchong’s eyes were wide open and he was extremely anxious.

Not far away, Xiao Sheng had already faced his fourth heavenly tribulation bolt. It would take some time before he could successfully break through!

At this moment, Xiao Hai’s leg had already entered the scene.

At this moment, Xiao Hai no longer could resist. His aura had been exhausted, and he could only watch as his body was swallowed.

At this moment of despair, a golden light suddenly shot toward Xiao Hai!

“What?”

The crowd was stunned and hurriedly looked over.

The person who had rushed over was none other than Qin Yu!

He was like a golden sword, cutting through the sky and slashing through the terrifying aura, heading straight for Xiao Hai!

“This kid... How did you do it?” Wen Wanchong’s eyes widened!

Jue Wu couldn’t help but open her small mouth, looking shocked.

Qu Zhu frowned and said in a low voice, “I’m afraid he has comprehended something.”

Xiao Sheng and Xiao Hai had comprehended the art of killing from the Great Dao of heaven and earth, and what Qin Yu had comprehended happened to fit his body, which was an extremely strong body!

At this moment, Qin Yu was wrapped in the mysterious golden light and was not affected by the terrifying aura at all.

Just like just now, everyone was knocked back by the terrible impact, except for Qin Yu!

At this critical moment, Qin Yu actually comprehended something!

“Could this also be the power of faith?” Qu Zhu murmured in a low voice, extremely shocked.
