Chapter 319: Face to Face with Yan Yunheng Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The car drove very slowly on the road, but the process wasn’t boring at all.

Finally, the car stopped at the entrance of the villa.

The two bodyguards at the entrance quickly moved forward and opened the car door for the two.

Qin Yu glanced at the two bodyguards, and couldn’t help but feel shocked.

The strength of these two bodyguards was probably on par with Yan Jiang’s!

“So this is the power of a large clan.” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

He tried to release his spiritual sense to sense the top-notch martial artists of the Yan family’s manor.

Soon, Qin Yu sensed several powerful internal qi forces.

These internal qi came from different directions, but they were enough for them to rush into the villa at the first possible moment.

Such safety measures made Qin Yu feel extremely pressured.

“Let’s go.” Yan Ruoxue winked at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu, looking a little nervous, stood at the door.

He suppressed his excitement and strode into the villa.

The first thing he saw was a large hall.

Updates by

This hall was decorated in a classical oriental style. At a glance, it was filled with wooden furniture.

Any piece of it would be highly valuable.

“There’s no one at home now. Everyone has gone out to work,” Yan Ruoxue said with a smile.

“Everyone should be back by tonight.”

Qin Yu nodded. Apart from nervousness, Qin Yu also felt expectant inside.

Because he also wanted to know what kind of people the descendants of the Yan family were.

At this moment, an old man appeared on the second floor.

He looked down at Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue and said in a slightly cold voice, “Ruoxue, bring him up.”

After saying this, Yan Yunheng turned and left.

His cold attitude shocked Qin Yu somewhat.

Fortunately, he had guessed the attitude of the Yan family early on, so he wasn’t too shocked.

“My grandfather is a very good person. Don’t be afraid,” Yan Ruoxue said.

Qin Yu forced a smile. “Good? Good towards you, but not necessarily towards others...”

Qin Yu had secretly investigated Yan Yunheng. Rumor had it that he had a nickname in Jingdu, Emperor Yan.

This nickname was enough to show everyone’s respect and fear for him.

Following behind Yan Ruoxue, Qin Yu came all the way upstairs.

The second floor was decorated in a completely different style. Compared to the ice-cold aura of the first floor, it was much more gentle.

At this moment, Yan Yunheng was sitting on the sofa while staring at a game of chess.

Beside him, two servants served him tea and water.

Qin Yu walked to Yan Yunheng, bowed and said, “Greetings, Old Mister Yan.”

Yan Yunheng didn’t say anything. It seemed that all his attention was on that chess game.

Qin Yu mustered up the courage to sit across from Yan Yunheng. His eyes also landed on this game of chess.

This move surprised Yan Yunheng, but he still didn’t say anything.

Seeing the two of them staring at the chess game, Yan Ruoxue also didn’t say anything.

The atmosphere was slightly heavy, as if even the air was about to freeze.

At this moment, Qin Yu took the lead to raise his hand and break the deadlock.

He picked up a chess piece and placed it down.

This move not only surprised Yan Yunheng, but even Yan Ruoxue was slightly surprised.

Was the Qin Yu in front of her still the timid Qin Yu from half a year ago?

The servants at the side felt waves of fear!

At this moment, Yan Yunheng finally raised his head to look at Qin Yu.

Although his expression was cold, he was somewhat relieved inside.

This kid really had extraordinary courage!

Yan Yunheng slowly raised his hand. He also picked up a chess piece and placed it down.

Qin Yu rubbed his chin and stared at this game for a long time before he raised his chess piece again and placed it down.

No one would have thought that the first time the two of them met was in the form of a game of chess!

This game of chess lasted for an entire hour.

Yan Yunheng became more and more engrossed in it.

Yan Yunheng’s chess moves forced Qin Yu into a dead end.

The gap between the two of them in the game was like the difference between heaven and earth.

In the end, Yan Yunheng won with one move.

“Hahaha!” Yan Yunheng couldn’t help but stroke his beard and burst into laughter.

Qin Yu sighed. “Old Mister Yan, your chess skills are really impeccable.”

The distance between the two of them seemed to be much closer.

In this situation, even Yan Ruoxue silently praised him.

However, at this moment, Yan Yunheng’s expression once again became ice-cold.

Almost no expression could be seen on his face.

His imposing and dignified bearing made people feel extremely pressured!

The temperament of someone powerful was clearly displayed at this moment.

It would be a lie to say that he wasn’t nervous, but Qin Yu didn’t have the slightest intention of retreating.

He raised his head and faced Old Mister Yan. His gaze was neither servile nor overbearing, neither happy nor sad.

Old Mister Yan looked coldly at Qin Yu and stroked his beard. “What right do you have to marry my granddaughter?”

Qin Yu said courteously, “Because I like her, and she likes me.”

Old Mister Yan snorted coldly. “Like? How much is that worth? Do you know how many people in Jingdu are pursuing my granddaughter?”

“In terms of family background or status, which one of them isn’t better than you?”

Qin Yu said with a calm expression, “You are right. I have no powerful family background. Compared to the Yan family, I have no advantage.”

“However, that is only limited to the present. It is hard to say what will happen in the future.”

Old Mister Yan snorted coldly. “Future? Even if an aristocratic family is declining, it will take several generations for it to happen! The rise of an aristocratic family will also take several generations!”

“You have nothing, so how can you speak of the future?”

Old Mister Yan’s words were reasonable and made people unable to find fault with him.

However, Qin Yu didn’t show any signs of panic. Sometimes, when facing someone powerful, sincerity was perhaps the rarest quality.

Qin Yu looked at Yan Ruoxue ans his eyes were filled with immense love.

“If Yan Ruoxue hadn’t appeared, perhaps I would have spent my life in mediocrity.”

“I would have worked and had children until I grew old and did nothing. My life would have been full of darkness.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“But Miss Yan’s appearance made me realize that there is really light in this world. She is my light.”

Qin Yu paused and looked at Yan Yunheng seriously, he said, “Old Mister Yan, I am worthless to you now. But no matter how you obstruct me, I will pursue Miss Yan unswervingly, whether you agree or not.”

As soon as Qin Yu said this, Old Mister Yan immediately slammed the table and stood up!

He said coldly, “Are you declaring war on me? Qin Yu, don’t use your insignificant achievements as your guarantee!”

“Let me tell you, from the moment you stepped into the Yan family, I can make you lose your future forever!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Qin Yu felt several powerful internal qi approaching him.

The killing intent from Yan Yunheng was obvious!

Qin Yu frowned tightly. He mobilized the internal qi in his body. It was best for him to use the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique and flee for his life at any time.

“Old Mister Yan, I’m sorry. I can’t die before I marry Miss Yan.” Qin Yu stood up and was prepared to flee for his life.

“Do you think you can escape?” Yan Yunheng said coldly.

The internal qi from all directions almost made Qin Yu unable to move! There was no possibility of the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique being used!

This made Qin Yu somewhat anxious. If he didn’t use the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique, he might really die here today!

“Alright Grandpa, don’t scare him!” At this moment, Yan Ruoxue said.
