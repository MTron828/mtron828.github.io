1838 The Mysterious Ninth Wave of Heavenly Tribulation

Qin Yu raised his head and stared at the sky, but the ninth wave of heavenly tribulation did not arrive.

Without a doubt, as the seventh and the eighth wave of heavenly tribulations were so gentle, it meant the ninth wave would be extremely terrifying.

The longer he waited, the more terrifying the ninth wave of heavenly tribulation would be.

This made Qin Yu feel a little uneasy. He waited quietly, but the heavenly tribulation still did not seem to be coming.

“D*mn it! Are you messing with my state of mind?” Qin Yu could not help but curse.

Before he could finish his sentence, finally, there was a reaction from the sky.

A ball of light that looked like a thunderball condensed in the sky.

After that, the thunderball fell as an egg dropped by the Path of Heaven!

Qin Yu subconsciously took two steps back. He looked at the thunderball nervously.

When Qin Yu saw carefully, he realized it was not a thunderball but a human!

It was a figure wrapped in lightning. Even though its face could not be seen clearly, one could still feel the cold expression on its face!

“This… What is this?” Qin Yu was extremely uneasy.

Could this be the true body of the Path of Heaven? Did his true body descend and become the ninth wave of heavenly tribulation? Wouldn’t it be too terrifying?

Or perhaps, it was a life born from the Path of Heaven! It was unimaginable!

Qin Yu took a deep breath and tried to calm himself down.

At this moment, the figure moved.

He stretched out his palm and pointed to the sky. In the next second, the dark clouds in the sky gathered in its palm!

All the dark clouds were caught in its hand, and the sky became clear again, leaving only Qin Yu and this figure!

All the dark clouds in the sky had merged into one with this thunder man!

“This… What’s going on?” Qin Yu frowned, feeling even more uneasy.

Before Qin Yu could react, the figure had arrived!

Its terrifying speed could not be described as fast at all. He seemed to have condensed in front of Qin Yu in an instant!

“This…” Qin Yu’s mouth was agape. He quickly came back to his senses and threw a punch over!

However, the figure dodged it easily. Just as Qin Yu had guessed, it seemed to disappear and appear again at a specific place at any time!

It was equivalent to an ability in which it could do things at will, and it could not be controlled!

“Could it be… a dao technique?” Qin Yu had a terrifying thought! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Even so, Qin Yu still tried his best to smash it.

He had used all his techniques, but none had any effect.

Even if they touched its body, they would be instantly devoured.

“It seems like it’s just as I thought. This thing in front of me is born from a dao technique!” Qin Yu was extremely frightened!

It was formed from a dao technique and could not be defeated at all!

It was because all cultivators lived under the dao techniques!

In other words, the dao technique was the world. Therefore, how could one fight against the world?

“Boom!”

At this moment, the figure made a move.

Its seemingly light palm, at the point of contact, directly blasted Qin Yu away!

Qin Yu’s primordial spirit seemed to have cracked, and the light on his body turned dimmer!

“Oh no… D*mn it…” Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically!

If this thing was really condensed from dao techniques, it would not need to make a move at all. With merely a thought, it could make Qin Yu disappear!

it was the power of the dao technique. To be able to comprehend even a little bit of it was already a great opportunity, not to mention the dao technique itself!

The thought flashed through Qin Yu’s mind. In the next second, the figure stopped moving.

It only glanced at Qin Yu, and Qin Yu’s body was directly sent flying!

“It… It’s true!” Qin Yu was shocked. This dao technique really wanted to make Qin Yu disappear completely!

At this moment, the dao technique made a move again. With a thought, Qin Yu’s body began to collapse!

Wisps of his primordial spirit were pulled out of his body. His body turned extremely dim, and everything before his eyes began to turn gloomy!

“Doomed… I’m doomed…” Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He could only watch helplessly as his body turned dim, and there was nothing he could do.

It was a sign of the destruction of the soul. Once the primordial spirit was shattered, nothing would exist!

From the outside, Qin Yu’s body was completely undamaged, which was very different from before!

This dao technique seemed to be erasing Qin Yu’s primordial spirit, divine sense, and consciousness!

“No… No!”

Qin Yu struggled with all his might. He raised his palm weakly as if he was trying to grab the fragments of his primordial spirit that were floating in the air.

But how could it be of any use? Everything seemed to be in vain!

At this moment of despair, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something!

He suddenly raised his head and looked at the thunder man in front of him!

“It is an illusion. It is the world of my consciousness!” Qin Yu suddenly woke up!

What did the world of his consciousness have to do with the dao technique?

In other words, in his consciousness, he was the true master of this world!

Even if you were the Path of Heaven or the Immortal Emperor, you couldn’t interfere with other people’s consciousness and intentions!

Thinking of this, Qin Yu seemed to have suddenly enlightened.

He stopped struggling and looked coldly at the thunder man in front of him.

Traces of dao techniques started to gather around his body.

Unlike the golden threads, Qin Yu’s consciousness was like fragments.

Slowly, more and more fragments attached to his primordial spirit and completely enveloped it.

The surrounding world had also changed, and everything seemed to be changing according to Qin Yu’s mind!

The primordial spirit that had been stripped from his body slowly returned to his original body under Qin Yu’s consciousness.

He raised his head and looked at the sky.

“I want a black sky,” Qin Yu murmured.

In the next second, the sky turned black!

“Rain,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“Pitter-patter!”

In an instant, heavy rain began to pour from the sky. The heavy rain poured down as if it was going to drown the entire world.

“I want a car.” Qin Yu began to try to imagine things that shouldn’t have appeared, but in his consciousness, nothing seemed impossible.

A car suddenly appeared in the world of cultivation.

Seeing this, Qin Yu could not help but sneer. This sneer slowly began to become presumptuous and arrogant!

“Hahaha!”

Qin Yu’s laughters shook the entire world!

“In this place, I am the true dao technique!” Qin Yu suddenly pointed forward and approached the thunder man!

The thunder man didn’t move at all. He stood there as if he had frozen.

“I want you to disappear from my world now!” Qin Yu shouted.

“I want you to fuse with my dao technique and become a part of me!”

With a roar, the thunder man’s body began to shatter into pieces.

The blue dao technique disappeared and began to slowly merge with the surrounding void and Qin Yu’s world.
