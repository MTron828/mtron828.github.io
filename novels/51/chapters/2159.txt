2160 Softhearted?

Hearing Yan Tianshi’s words, everyone was stunned on the spot. Even Qin Yu was stunned.

“Holy Lord Yan, you can’t let this child off! Otherwise, he’ll definitely cause a disaster in the future!”

“That’s right, Holy Lord Yan. We’ve done so much just to get rid of him. Now that he’s right before us, why should we let him go?”

“Even if we let him leave the Holy Region, he will not give up. He will return sooner or later!”

Everyone stepped forward with unwillingness filling their eyes.

Qin Yu also frowned as if he could not believe Yan Tianshi’s words.

“They are right. Even if I leave the Holy Region today, I will return one day,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Yan Tianshi snorted and said, “It’s your own ability if you can come back.”

With a hint of astonishment in his eyes, Qin Yu’ looked at Yan Tianshi and said, “Do you really let me go?”

“Didn’t I make myself clear enough? I want you to leave the Holy Region From today onward,” Yan Tianshi said coldly.

“Holy Lord Yan, you mustn’t do this!” The others walked forward again and continued to advise him.

However, Yan Tianshi had made up his mind and ignored everyone.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment before saying, “Give me some time to prepare.”

“I won’t give you any time. It’s either you leave immediately or I’ll kill you now.” Yan Tianshi stretched out his palm, and a terrifying killing intent burst forth.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “Alright, I’ll leave the Holy Region today.”

Yan Tianshi snorted coldly. He no longer cared about Qin Yu and turned around, intending to leave.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s gaze fell on Si Shiyue.

Si Shiyue did the same. The two seemed to have a telepathic connection and walked toward each other.

The two faced each other and looked at each other with hostility in their eyes.

After a while, Qin Yu took the lead and said, “Yan Ruoxue doesn’t like you.”

“I know.” Si Shiyue’s reaction surprised Qin Yu.

He looked at Qin Yu and said, “I’ll wait for you for a hundred years. I definitely won’t touch Yan Ruoxue for a hundred years.”

Si Shiyue paused and continued, “I’m certainly not a gentleman. The reason I did this is to tell the world that I’m stronger than you. The Yan family bloodline will belong to whoever wins.

“I want to defeat you fairly and openly, with honesty and integrity.”

Si Shiyue’s words shocked Qin Yu even more.

This was the first time Qin Yu scrutinized Si Shiyue directly.

Although Qin Yu disliked Si Shiyue, he was someone with aspirations.

“If you don’t return to the Holy Region within a hundred years, I’ll take it as you’re already dead,” Si Shiyue said coldly.

“Deal.” Qin Yu said coldly.

“A hundred years later, I will definitely defeat you.”

” We’re both chaotic bodies. I’ll tell the world who’s the strongest,” Si Shiyue sneered and said.

After saying this, Si Shiyue turned around and left without looking back.

“Si Shiyue is a gentleman,” Dean Lei said.

Qin Yu nodded. He looked at Dean Lei and said, “Please send me back. Perhaps I need to use your teleportation formation.”

Dean Lei nodded. He patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “No matter what, at least you managed to keep your life.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Yes,” Qin Yu could not help but sigh. “I thought I would surely die this time. I didn’t expect Yan Tianshi to let me off.”

At this moment, the True Saints of the other aristocratic families had ugly expressions on their faces. They looked at Qin Yu’s back, and their eyes emitted an incomparable coldness.

“Yan Tianshi is really old and muddle-headed,” a True Saint said coldly.

“This kid is tremendously talented. No one knows how far he will grow by giving him a hundred years. By then, he will definitely come to us to settle the score!”

“He’s muddle-headed, but we can’t be,” a True Saint said coldly.

After hearing this, several of them instantly understood, and their eyes immediately emitted cold killing intent.

…

On the Yan family’s ancient ship, Yan Ruoxue’s expression was still ugly. Although Qin Yu managed to keep his life, no one knew if he could return.

“Holy Lord, why did you let Qin Yu off?” On the deck of the ancient ship, an elder of the Yan family walked over and asked.

“He kidnapped the saintess and has been at odds with the various aristocratic families. Do we just let him go?”

Yan Tianshi looked into the distance and said with some emotion, “This kid… He’s not simple. Perhaps I should reassess this person.”

“Oh?” The elder seemed surprised.

Yan Tianshi was silent for a moment before he slowly said, “To be honest, his words have indeed moved me. I now… understand Ruoxue.”

Yan Tianshi looked at Yan Ruoxue, sitting not far away.

“Those who can move you are indeed not easily found,” the elder sighed and said.

Yan Tianshi did not say anything. No one knew what he was thinking.

“Although you let him go, the others might not,” the elder continued.

“That has nothing to do with me. It depends on how things turn out,” Yan Tianshi said quietly.

…

At Thunder Courtyard.

Qin Yu followed Dean Lei back to Thunder Courtyard.

“Are you really leaving?” Dean Lei looked at Qin Yu and could not help but frown.

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. “Yan Tianshi has spared my life. I should keep my promise.”

Seeing this, Dean Lei no longer said anything else and could only sigh.

From the looks of it now, this seemed to be the best outcome.

“Dean Lei, I’ll have to bother you to activate the formation and send me out of here,” Qin Yu said.

After such a long time, Qin Yu wanted to go back to Earth to take a look.

Under the Great Upheaval situation, it was unknown if there were any powerful cultivators on Earth today.

However, Dean Lei shook his head and said, “Thunder Courtyard’s formation will allow you to traverse the void, but it can’t accurately pinpoint your location.

“In other words, on such a long journey, the formation might even make you enter the endless void and never come out of it.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Then how should I leave the Holy Region?”

“You can only go through the warship,” Dean Lei said.

“Warship?” This surprised Qin Yu.

Warships could traverse the void, but Qin Yu had never tried it.

Dean Lei looked at Qin Yu and said, “Follow me.”

Qin Yu dared not waste time. He quickly followed Dean Lei and walked toward a specific place on the main peak of Thunder Courtyard.

The two walked around and finally came to an empty space.

This place was quite spacious, and the scenery was pleasant.

With his hands behind his back, Dean Lei slightly narrowed his eyes. With a thought, a gigantic warship appeared in front of the two. A huge word, “Lei”, was written on the warship.
