After hearing the deputy sect leader’s words, Qin Yu’s expression immediately sank.

He had originally believed in Xiao Sheng, but now, all sorts of signs made Qin Yu begin to suspect.

Most importantly, he had actually left at this juncture. How Could Qin Yu understand this?

“Qin Yu, why don’t you wait here for him? He’ll probably be back very soon,”said the deputy sect leader.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and tried his best to calm himself down.

Then, he looked at the deputy sect master and said with a smile, “Okay, I’ll wait for him at the Heavenly Cloud sect. By the way, is there any news from the northern lands recently?”

Upon mentioning this topic, the deputy sect master’s expression could not help but darken.

He said with a dark face, “Recently, there has been news that several border cities have disappeared. All the people inside have died. The way they died is exactly the same as what the northern lands did.”

Qin Yu was not surprised. He had long guessed that the northern lands would not give up just like that. It was just that they would not be so high-profile anymore.

“I understand. Mobilize the surrounding sects and protect the surrounding cities on your own.”Qin Yu nodded.

The deputy sect master nodded and said, “I have already done so.”

“Okay.”Qin Yu did not say anything more. He pulled Zhuo Jing and turned around to walk towards the library.

Other than Xiao Sheng, that master freewill probably knew something too.

“Where are we going?”Zhuo Jing asked, somewhat dumbfounded.

Qin Yu said, “You’ll know in a while.”

The two of them walked all the way to the library and Found Master Freewill.

Master Freewill was still the same as before. He was cleaning and tidying up the books all day long.

He seemed to be a little surprised to see Qin Yu rushing over.

“Master Freewill.”Qin Yu bowed slightly.

Freewill answered and then asked, “Have you been to the East Wilderness?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, I have been there, but I have a lot of doubts in my heart.”

Freewill did not say anything and waited for Qin Yu’s follow-up.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “What is the secret of the East Wilderness? Also, is the history of the South Province you wrote true or false? Does it have any personal feelings?”

A series of questions made Sui Xin not know how to answer.

He thought for a moment and said, “The books I wrote did not have any personal feelings. Not only did I not have any personal feelings, but no one could make me hide the truth.”

Qin Yu looked at Sui Xin coldly, as if he wanted to see something from his face.

Unfortunately, Sui Xin did not seem to be lying.

“Master Freewill, do you know anything about the East Wilderness?”Qin Yu asked.

Freewill shook his head and said, “No, I don’t. I Can’t go to the East Wilderness. All the information about the East Wilderness was obtained through investigation.”

Qin Yu sighed slightly.

It seemed that it was almost impossible to learn anything from freewill.

However, what he said did not seem to be a lie. With his strength, once he stepped into the East Wilderness, he would never be able to walk out again.

“Thank you,”Qin Yu bowed and said. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and left with Zhuo Jing.

The Tianyun sect had arranged a place for Qin Yu, so Qin Yu did not stand on ceremony. He planned to stay here and wait for Xiao Sheng’s return.

In the room, Zhuo Jing asked in a deep voice, “Is what that Freewill said true?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “He shouldn’t be lying.”

Zhuo Jing forced a smile and said, “I hope so. But... Xiao Sheng’s disappearance at this time really makes people suspicious.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He naturally didn’t want to believe that Xiao Sheng was trying to harm him.

“How long are we waiting here?”Zhuo Jing asked.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “We’ll wait for a few days. We don’t have enough time. If he doesn’t come back later, we have to leave too.”

Qin Yu had obtained the Dragon’s blood and the dragon’s eye, which were holy items for cultivation.

Moreover, he didn’t know when the northern land would attack, so Qin Yu had to go into closed-door cultivation as soon as possible.

In the next few days, Qin Yu and Zhuo Jing quietly waited for the return of the sect master in the Heavenly Cloud Sect.

In the blink of an eye, five days had passed. During these five days, Qin Yu went to the cultivation mountain almost every day. Unfortunately, there was no sign of Saint Xiao returning.

“We can’t wait any longer,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“In any case, we have already gone to the East Wilderness and returned safely. As for whether he is lying to us or not, we don’t need to worry about this for now.”Qin Yu looked at Zhuo Jing.

Zhuo Jing nodded and said with a bitter smile, “It’s just that... I don’t know what kind of effect the curse that mysterious person mentioned will have.”

“Yeah.”Qin Yu sighed.

Then, Qin Yu looked at Zhuo Jing and said, “Come with me.”

“Where are we going?”Zhuo Jing asked.

“Mount Dayue,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

It was impossible for Qin Yu to monopolize the dragon’s eye. At the very least, he had to give it to Zhuo Jing.

Besides Zhuo Jing, Wen Wenzi, Qu Zhu, and the others should also get a share.

It wasn’t that Qin Yu was generous, but it was just that this thing couldn’t be used up in a short amount of time. Just a drop of dragon blood was enough for a cultivator to cultivate for a long time.

Besides that, no one knew what would happen during the war with the northern lands, so it was naturally better to have one more person.

The two of them rushed all the way to the great Yue mountain.

On the peak of the mountain, Wen Wanyi, Zhuo Jing, and Qin Yu were sitting cross-legged.

“Master, do you know the East Barren?”Qin Yu asked.

Hearing this, Wen wanyun said in surprise, “The east barren? Why do you want to Know About It?”

Qin Yu did not hide it and immediately told Wen wanyun about what had happened during this period of time.

After hearing it, Wen Wanyun was shocked!

“You... you have been to the East Barren?”Wen wanyun frowned very tightly.

Qin Yu nodded and waited for Wen Wanyun to continue.

Wen wanyun took a deep breath and continued, “I heard that the Eastern Wilderness is an extremely terrifying place. It’s called the cursed land. No matter how powerful a person is, they will eventually die there.”

“As far as I know, there are countless true saints who have died in the Eastern Wilderness.”Wen Wanyun looked at Qin Yu coldly.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “That place is indeed very scary. We were lucky to escape.”

“It’s already good enough to be able to escape,”Wen Wanyun said.

Qin Yu continued to ask, “Master, have you ever heard of a curse in the East Barren?”

“Yes. Since it’s called a cursed place, it naturally has a curse.”Wen Wanyun looked at Qin Yu as if he was looking at a fool.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “It’s not about that place. It’s about the curse directed at people. When the two of US returned, we met someone who said that we were cursed by the east barren.”

“That’s right.”Zhuo Jing nodded and told Wen Wanyi about his father.

Wen Wanyi’s expression changed. He did not speak for a long time and kept pacing on the mountain top.

A few seconds later, Wen Wanyi looked at Qin Yu and said coldly, “I’m afraid that the curse is the same as the one in the east barren.”
