Chapter 2033: The Arrival of the Holy Sons

Seeing the barrier that was enveloped by the light, everyone’s expressions instantly turned ugly.

“What’s going on? The abnormality of the Chaos Grave?”

“No, it looks like a kind of special method!”

“Why did it envelop us here?”

!!

Everyone was panicking, and Qin Yu’s brows were tightly furrowed.

He walked to the edge and stretched out his hands, trying to walk out of the barrier. However, he found the barrier to be tremendously strange as all the power would bounce back.

“Everyone, don’t panic.” At this moment, someone from the Si family rose into the sky and stood on a high spot.

He stared at everyone and said indifferently,” To prevent anything untoward, the Si family has set up a formation here. No one is allowed to leave before the Chaos Grave opens.”

As soon as this was said, it stirred up numerous discussions.

“What? It’s a formation the Si family set up?”

“What do they mean by this? They don’t allow us to leave? Are they afraid that the treasure will fall into our hands?”

“What a detestable Si family!”

Qin Yu’s expression was even uglier. If this was the case, even if Qin Yu obtained that chaotic body, he probably could not leave this place!

“The Si family…” Qin Yu gritted his teeth. They had made a foolproof plan. This way, they could ensure that the chaotic body would remain in their hands!

Qin Yu looked around and thought to himself, “I wonder if I can escape from this place by using a spatial spell. If I can, there’s still a chance.”

Although Qin Yu was not proficient in controlling spatial spells, there must be a way as long as he could leave this place.

Many people were present. Thus naturally, there would be top-notch martial artists in spatial spells hidden among them.

“From now on, you can only enter and not leave within a radius of 300 stars from the Chaos Grave,” the elder continued.

“What? 300 stars? It doesn’t look like it’s within 300 stars at all.”

“Obviously, we only saw the first barrier. I’m afraid there’re several more barriers surrounding the Chaos Grave! ‘

“The Si family… is truly brilliant!”

The elder of the Si family could naturally see the crowd’s dissatisfaction, and he also didn’t want to anger them. Therefore he said with a smile, “The chaotic body is of great importance to our Si family, so we must get it. Of course, we won’t let you go back empty-handed. We’ll make sure you’re satisfied.”

After hearing this, everyone’s resentment clearly dissipated significantly.

However, not everyone was so easy to convince. In the crowd, a cultivator sneered and said, “What we get is ours. Why do we need your Si family to distribute it? Is the Si family the emperor?”

“That’s right! The Si family is obviously trying to gain hegemony!”

Some people waved his hand and said, “Forget it. That’s the Si family. It’s good enough for them to distribute some alms to us.”

“That’s right. If we anger them, we won’t get anything.”

“F*ck you. You’re willing to be a slave, but I’m not! I’ve already said. What’s in my hands is mine. No one can take it away unless they kill me!”

Two voices exploded in the crowd, but the elder of the Si family could not be bothered.

There was no other reason than that he had successfully diverted the conflict. These people could not achieve anything and would collapse on their own. Qin Yu looked coldly at the people of the Si family while thinking of a countermeasure. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The Si family had already raised the spatial barrier, which meant the Chaos Grave was about to open.

“The man with the mustache must be here,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

The man with the mustache was mysterious and unpredictable. As long as there were treasures, he would definitely be there.

The Chaos Grave shocked all the experts in the Holy Region, so the man with the mustache naturally would not be an exception.

“I wonder if that Qin Yu is here yet,” Si Liuhe put his hands behind his back and said indifferently.

Yan Guyun glanced at Si Liuhe and said, “I heard that Qin Yu killed an elder of the Si family, did he? It is really a slap on your Si family’s face.”

“He’s quite capable,” Si Liuhe said with a faint smile.” But there’s nothing to be afraid of him.’

“Nothing to be afraid of? Then why did you want to kill him?” Yan Guyun sneered and said.

Si Liuhe shook his head and said, “This is the head of the family’s order. I can only obey.”

Si Liuhe paused for a while before continuing, “Brother Guyun, I heard that you fought with Qin Yu before. Why did you let him go?”

“Fight? Me fighting him?” Yan Guyun sneered. ” If it weren’t for the third princess, Qin Yu would have died long ago.”

“The third princess pleaded for mercy? The third princess pleaded for mercy for Qin Yu?” Si Liuhe was incredibly surprised.

The third princess was incredibly famous in the Holy Region for her unruly personality.

“I don’t know what methods he used to make the saintess fall for him, and the third princess plead for mercy for him,” Yan Guyun said.

Si Liuhe’s face turned cold as he said coldly, “The saintess fell for him? Stop joking.”

“Whether I’m joking or not, you should know well,” Yan Guyun snorted and said. “If Qin Yu is not dead, he will definitely be Si Shiyue’s rival.”

“Don’t act like an outsider. Qin Yu is not only Si Shiyue’s rival but also the rival of all the young people in the Holy Region,” Si Liuhe said indifferently.

Yan Guyun seemed to be too lazy to argue with him. He turned his head to the side and said nothing else.

“Ever since the extraditions a few years ago, many geniuses have appeared in the Holy Region. I really wonder what kind of place the other side is.” Si Liuhe sighed with emotion.

Although they were powerful, they could not cross the void.

If they wanted to cross the void with the help of the formation, they would also need opportunities. It was not something up to them.

The strange phenomenon of the Chaos Grave was non-stop. The ground rumbled, and chaos qi was spurting from time to time.

Si Shiyue’s eyes never left the Chaos Grave. His dao heart was unstable earlier, but now that he had come to the Chaos Grave, he had become very determined.

“Brother Si, after the opening of the Chaos Grave, you’re probably going to become the number one person among the younger generation of the Holy Region,” Saintess Gu walked over and said with a smile.

...

Si Shiyue glanced at her and replied casually, “Everything is still uncertain. No one can say for sure.”

“A few years ago, there was a rumor that Teng Zixu, the divine body of the Teng family, was the number one expert of the young generation. Brother Si probably will surpass him now, ” Yao Xi also walked over at this moment.

Si Shiyue snorted coldly and said, “Teng Zixu? Who has ever admitted that he is the number one Holy Son?”

“Teng Zixu has been in closed-door cultivation for almost ten years now, right?” Gu Saintess changed the topic.

“That’s right. I remember he was already at the Advanced-stage of the Reversion Void before he went into seclusion. Now that he hasn’t come out of seclusion, he’s probably trying to break through to the True Saint cultivation realm,” Yao Xi said deliberately as if he was stirring up a fire.

Si Shiyue could not stand it anymore. He snorted coldly and walked away..
