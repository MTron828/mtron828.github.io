1852 The Life Aura?

“Thank you, Peak Master,” Qin Yu bowed slightly and said.

“Just don’t forget your promise to me,” the peak Master said with a bitter smile.

“Sure, I will,” Qin Yu nodded and said.

Qin Yu had promised the peak master that he would win first place for Demon-slaying Peak, which was not difficult for him.

Qin Yu then looked at Jiu Xiao and said, “Many thanks.”

Jiu Xiao did not say much and only nodded.

After they left, Qin Yu was slightly relieved.

With the promise of the peak master, Qin Yu felt much more confident.

“With this, we can attack the Tong family together with Demon-slaying Peak,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Tong Guangqing, soon you will pay the price for this!”

In the following days, Qin Yu stayed at Demon-slaying Peak, waiting for the next mission.

Three days later.

Demon-slaying Peak finally issued a new mission.

The peak master got hold of Qin Yu early in the morning,

He took out a note and handed it to Qin Yu.

The paper was written with a name and the person’s location.

“This is the evilest person in this mission, and he is also from Zhongzhou. He might be of help to you,” the peak master said.

Qin Yu took the note and said, “Thank you, Peak Master.”

“Don’t let anyone know about this,” the peak master said, waving his hand. “Otherwise, I’ll lose my position as the peak master.”

“I understand.” Qin Yu quickly nodded.

Holding the location details, Qin Yu looked at Chang Mang.

“Let’s go!” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Let’s go!” Chang Mang said, swaying his arms.

The two of them didn’t waste time. They immediately rushed to the teleportation platform and went straight to Zhongzhou.

This was Qin Yu’s second time coming to Zhongzhou. However, different from the last time, they found themselves surrounded by desolation, and the prosperity in Zhongzhou was gone when they arrived at their destination. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Is this Zhongzhou? Did I come to the wrong place?” Chang Mang couldn’t help but mutter.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No, there’s no way the teleportation formation of Thunder Courtyard could go wrong.”

Qin Yu then took out the note.

A name was written on the note, as well as some related information.

The target’s name was Demon Jingshan. He was a powerful Reversion Void Stage cultivator.

As the note did not mention what Demon Jingshan had done, Qin Yu was not too sure.

He activated his desolate divine eye and looked in the direction in front of them.

There were mountaintops one after another in front of them. These mountaintops looked very weird as if someone had placed them there. They looked very mysterious.

With just a glance, Qin Yu noticed something was not right.

He released his divine sense covering a radius of several dozen stars.

Qin Yu could clearly sense countless living beings with his divine sense.

These people were not very powerful. Only a few were the Reversion Void Stage cultivators. It was very different from what Qin Yu had imagined.

“How is it?” Chang Mang asked.

“Let’s go,” Qin Yu shook his head and said.

Chang Mang didn’t say much. He would just follow Qin Yu’s instructions.

Therefore, the two of them immediately rushed toward the mountaintop in front of them.

They arrived at the mysterious mountain streams.

Qin Yu slightly squinted his eyes and looked in the direction in front of him.

A small formation was in the very center of the mountain streams. It was impossible to see its origin as the formation was covered by a thick fog.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly smelled something very familiar in the mountains.

Although the smell was very faint, it could not escape Qin Yu’s divine sense.

“This feeling is…” Qin Yu’s pupils suddenly constricted. Was this the smell of Life Aura?

Qin Yu couldn’t help feeling shocked. Back then, to find Life Aura, Qin Yu had paid a huge price. He didn’t expect to detect Life Aura in this desolate place!

“That’s not right.”

At this moment, Qin Yu frowned again and soon noticed the abnormality.

There was indeed the smell of Life Aura here, but it was much diluted than the Life Aura that Qin Yu absorbed back then.

It was like the Life Aura that had been diluted many times, and it faintly mixed in the air.

“What is going on?” Qin Yu frowned.

For a moment, he couldn’t think clearly.

Just as he was about to step forward, a large group of people suddenly walked out from all directions of the mountain streams!

They were walking like the dead toward Qin Yu.

At a glance, they were in a compact mass and seemed to be hundreds of people.

“Qin Yu, be careful!” Chang Mang hurriedly reminded. When he finished speaking, he stepped forward and subconsciously blocked Qin Yu behind him.

With the iron tower-like Chang Mang standing in front of him, Qin Yu indeed felt a great sense of security.

He didn’t know if it was because of his huge body or the trust they had for each other, but as long as the two of them were together, they feared nothing.

This group of people gathered and walked toward them. At this moment, Chang Mang’s internal qi also erupted.

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold. He looked at Chang Mang and said coldly, “Step aside. Leave these people to me.”

After saying that, Qin Yu stomped his feet and jumped up into the sky.

His body emitted a blazing light. This light was extremely terrifying as if it was brewing on his body.

This technique was Heavenly Flower of All that he inherited from Jue Wu! Its power was terrifying to the extreme!

Not to mention this group of people of weaker strength, even cultivators of the same cultivation realm couldn’t take it!

A ray of light was emitted from Qin Yu’s body and easily wiped out one of them.

Qin Yu’s control over the Heavenly Flower of All was naturally not as skillful as Jue Wu’s.

As a result, his body was overflowing with light.

Wherever the light passed, a person would be easily wiped out.

The light was brewing on Qin Yu’s body. It was getting even hotter and its power was getting even more terrifying.

The light emitted wiped people out non-stop.

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu had already killed eight cultivators!

Just as Qin Yu was about to use the Heavenly Flower of All, he suddenly realized the cultivators walking toward him did not have any killing intent on their faces. Instead, they were full of fear and pain!

If one looked carefully, one could see that some were shedding tears!

“Something is wrong!”

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically! He suddenly realized that something was not right!

This group of people was only at the Mighty Realm, so why would they charge at him without hesitation?

More importantly, why were they crying in tears and pain?

At this moment, he had unleashed the Heavenly Flower of All to the extreme. It was too late to stop now!

Countless rays of light gathered on Qin Yu’s body like a nuclear bomb that was about to explode. It was completely uncontrollable!

“Ah!”

Even though Qin Yu tried his best to control it, he still failed in the end!
