Chapter 445: Devouring the Dragon Spirit! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The two of them shot towards the Dragon Spirit!

He Teng’s expression changed drastically as he roared, “Qin Yu, how dare you!”

“Why wouldn’t I dare to?! Those who see it will get a share!” Qin Yu sneered.

Who wouldn’t be tempted by such an etheral holy item?!

He Teng gritted his teeth and chanted an incantation silently. Streams of strange power shot towards Qin Yu!

This power seemed to be able to affect one’s divine sense. Qin Yu felt his head buzz and almost fell to the ground!

In just an instant, the distance between He Teng and Qin Yu had widened!

“Hmph, I’m definitely going to take this Dragon Spirit!” Qin Yu said coldly.

In the next second, Qin Yu used Shrinking Ground Into An Inch and charged towards the Dragon Spirit!

He Teng’s face was extremely pale! He had put in a lot of effort for this Dragon Spirit. If it was snatched away by Qin Yu just like that, it would be worse than death for him!

“You’re courting death!” He Teng said furiously!

He immediately activated the magic artifact above his head and shot towards Qin Yu explosively!

A level of barrier was formed in front of Qin Yu once again!

“This move again?” Qin Yu sneered repeatedly.

“We both have magic artifacts. Do you think this spell can stop me?!”

Qin Yu roared and threw out a punch with his golden fist!

“Crack!”

The barrier shattered and turned into nothingness!

Qin Yu’s body shot out again and headed straight for the Dragon Spirit!

He Teng’s speed was obviously not as fast as Qin Yu’s. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

This immediately made him panic and sweat profusely!

“Qin Yu, you are courting death!” He Teng acted as if he had gone mad and activated his magic artifact to suppress Qin Yu!

The earthen pot carried a suppressive force as it slowly floated over.

Qin Yu felt as if there was a huge mountain above his head, and his entire body was about to be pressed into the ground!

“You have a magic artifact, but so do I!” Qin Yu snorted coldly.

Following that, he activated the Venerable Fifth Mountain and pushed back the earthen pot!

Not only that, but Qin Yu even threw the Venerable Fifth Mountain towards He Teng to suppress him!

Qin Yu’s magic artifact was obviously better.

The Venerable Fifth Mountain was infinitely enlarged above He Teng’s head, and then it ruthlessly pressed down on He Teng.

“Boom!”

Facing the suppression of the Venerable Fifth Mountain, He Teng had no strength to retaliate!

Finally, his body was ruthlessly pressed to the ground!

“Whoosh!”

Qin Yu took this opportunity to stride forward and grab the Dragon Spirit!

The Dragon Spirit in Qin Yu’s palm flickered with a faint golden light. At a glance, it didn’t seem to be much different from an ordinary Golden Pill.

“This is the Dragon Spirit?” Qin Yu sized up the Dragon Spirit, and a trace of excitement flashed in his eyes.

He Teng was completely flustered as he shouted desperately, “Qin Yu! Give me the Dragon Spirit!”

Qin Yu glanced at He Teng and sneered. “Give it to you? Why should I give it to you?”

He Teng said in a panic, “Qin Yu, as long as you give me the Dragon Spirit, I can give you everything I have! This Dragon Spirit is very important to me. You... you must return it to me!”

“What do you mean by return it to you?” Qin Yu sneered.

“This Dragon Spirit is originally an item of nature. Whoever gets it first will get it. Now that it is in my hands, it is mine.”

“You!” He Teng was enraged!

He never thought that after working so hard for so long, he actually helped someone else get it!

“Qin Yu, you don’t know how to use this Dragon Spirit.” He Teng suppressed the anger in his heart and said slowly.

“As long as you return the Dragon Spirit to me, I can give you a 10,000-year-old herb!”

“10,000-year-old?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

Then, he whispered, “This is quite an attractive condition...”

He Teng suddenly felt that there was a chance. He was delighted and struck while the iron was hot. “Yes! This Dragon Spirit is useless in your hands. Isn’t it good to exchange it for a 10,000-year-old herb?”

“Useless?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

He sized up He Teng and said indifferently, “Do you think I’m an idiot? I think you told me that as long as I get the Dragon Spirit, I can obtain the power of the Divine Dragon, right?”

He Teng was overwhelmed with regret!

If he had known this would happen, he wouldn’t have said such a thing in the first place!

“I made it up! Hurry up and give me the Dragon Spirit!” He Teng almost roared out these words.

How could he give up on something that was almost in his hands?

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I’m sorry, this Dragon Spirit is mine.”

After saying that, Qin Yu opened his mouth and put it into his mouth.

He Teng hurriedly shouted, “I’m telling you, this Dragon Spirit can’t be swallowed! It’s useless to swallow it!”

Qin Yu didn’t believe him at all. He swallowed the Dragon Spirit into his stomach.

When he saw that the Dragon Spiritwas swallowed into his stomach, He Teng’s face instantly turned extremely pale, as if he had been drained of all his strength.

“Ah!!”

Qin Yu, who had swallowed the Dragon Spirit, could feel a trace of heat flowing through his dantian, as if it was about to explode!

His entire body was enveloped by rays of golden light, and his physical body was trembling non-stop!

A terrifying power surrounded him while creating an extremely powerful storm!

If one listened carefully, one could even hear faint dragon roars!

He Teng’s face was pale, and his entire expression was contorted.

“Let’s go. You’re no match for him.” That hoarse voice sounded in his mind.

He Teng gritted his teeth and took out another magic artifact.

Then, He Teng looked at Meng Wuxiong and said, “Let’s go.”

Meng Wuxiong hurriedly walked over and saw a pitch-black void in front of them.

In the next second, He Teng actually disappeared.

Qin Yu’s body was still trembling non-stop, and wisps of flame-like color appeared between his brows.

The terrifying power began to slowly converge and condense before finally sinking into the dantian.

This Dragon Spirit floated in the air above the dantian while emitting wisps of pure spiritual energy.

“Hiss!”

Qin Yu gasped, and his eyes suddenly opened!

His eyes turned fiery red, and the power of the Divine Dragon slowly flowed in his body.

Qin Yu’s mind moved, and the fiery red in his eyes slowly disappeared, then he returned to his normal state.

“This is the power of the Divine Dragon?” Qin Yu lowered his head to feel the power in his body, and a trace of madness flashed across his face!

He even felt that with the power of the Divine Dragon, he could fight against a half-step Martial Marquis!

Then, Qin Yu summoned the power of the Divine Dragon again.

His eyes also turned fiery red.

“As soon as I summon the power of the Divine Dragon, my eyes can feel a different power,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

“Speaking of which, I really have to thank He Teng...” Qin Yu sneered.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly saw Fang Yue lying on the ground motionlessly.

He hurriedly walked in front of Fang Yue and helped her up.

“Fang Yue, are... are you okay?” Qin Yu called out softly.

But unfortunately, Fang Yue didn’t answer.
