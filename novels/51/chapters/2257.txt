2258 Wrath of the Unicorn

Moreover, he had the protection of the divine artifact that had the combination of the unicorn’s soul and the Soul-hunting Bell. Ming Yue’s soul attack could not do anything to him at all.

The physical aura of an eighth-grade True Saint was still extremely terrifying.

His speed was even faster than Qin Yu’s.

“Don’t think you can close the gap between us just because you have a divine artifact. So what if I fight you head-on?”

Shui Yuan sneered and said.

The two clashed with a punch, and the tremendous force blasted them back several hundred meters.”

Qin Yu took a step forward, covering several tens of meters, and behind him, nine massive columns of fire took shape.

Under his divine thought, the columns of fire surged toward Shui Yuan like a spirit snake. With the overwhelming and expansive columns of fire, Shui Yuan found almost no escape route.

“Whoosh!”

The moment the nine dragons surrounded Shui Yuan, the air around him distorted, and the rules of space suddenly changed. His domain space expanded rapidly.

His speed increased again, and he passed through the nine fire dragons swiftly, and his body smashed into Qin Yu’s body like a magical artifact.

The body of an eighth-grade True Saint had long been tempered to be incomparably hard.

Qin Yu’s boxing gloves transformed into a shield, blocking the terrifying attack.

The energy of the dead bodies of Shui Yuan swirled and turned into hundreds of corpse fists that smashed fiercely on Qin Yu’s giant shield, sending him flying.

“Hmm?”

Qin Yu frowned. Shui Yuuan’s domain seemed to be similar to a support type.

After he activated his domain, his speed and strength would increase once again.

Without hesitation, a fist of lava condensed at his back.

“Boom!”

The massive fist of lava was drawn onto Shui Yuan’s chest, turning the energy of dead bodies into steam.

“Shui Yuan is also going all out.”

“A third-grade True Saint versus an eighth-grade True Saint, and he isn’t at a disadvantage in physical strength.”

The surrounding cultivators were somewhat uneasy, and they stared fixedly at the situation, secretly planning their next moves.

“That’s all the strength of an eighth grade?”

Qin Yu panted slightly. He had used up more than half of her chaotic power.

After all, Shui Yuan was the sect master of one of the four great forces, and his strength was honed through trials in the Blood Sea. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Three enormous fists of fire fists gradually condensed in the air, and Shui Yuan’s expression changed.

“Boom!”

Before he could react, a loud unicorn’s roar instantly enveloped him.

In the blink of an eye, the three enormous fists had already sealed off the space of all of his escape routes.

A fierce and ruthless expression appeared on Shui Yuan’s face. He twisted his body at a strange angle, avoiding a vital strike. The punch pierced through more than half of his shoulder. His body then moved as fluidly as a stream, appearing in front of Qin Yu in an instant.”

All the energy of dead bodies in his body surged into his right hand. His entire right hand turned into a gigantic ax, and countless vengeful souls coiled around it.

The terrifying energy of dead bodies temporarily suppressed the surrounding power of fire.

Fist of Destruction!

Qin Yu’s fist of domain fused with the power of fire elements received the gigantic ax. The fist with the fusion of black and red met the gigantic ax head-on. The tremendous impact produced a deafening noise, causing some cultivators’ eardrums to burst and become deaf.

“Go to hell! Ultimate domain.”

Shui Yuan’s eyes were blood-red. The domain in his hand suddenly shrank to an inch and enveloped his hand.

An inexplicable sense of danger surged in Qin Yu’s heart. A tremendous amount of chaotic power surged to his glabella as he unleashed the desolate divine eye.

The veins on Shui Yuan’s arm exploded, and his muscles expanded again.

A tremendous force erupted as the gigantic ax slashed down ruthlessly, cutting off half of Qin Yu’s shoulder.

“Huff, huff, huff!”

Shui Yuan’s legs trembled as he panted heavily on the ground. His expression was incomparably ferocious.

He did not expect Qin Yu to dodge the gigantic ax’s slash at the last moment. Otherwise, his head would have been chopped off.

Qin Yu’s muscles squirmed, and his blood vessels contracted, stopping the blood from gushing.

Nangong Qi’s sword slashed over, and a tremendous sword light suddenly exploded before Qin Yu. However, Qin Yu grabbed it with one hand and crushed the sword light directly.

“Boom!”

Several treasures slammed into his protective spiritual energy.

Shui Yuan looked at Qin Yu with a sinister smile. His desperate attack was finally effective.

When the surrounding cultivators saw that Qin Yu was injured, they finally could not help but start to attack.

Nearly a hundred cultivators were there. When these people gathered together, the combat strength was terrifying.

Otherwise, the two sects would not have compromised before the battle. Once these rogue cultivators sensed an opportunity, they would not hesitate to attack!

“Qin Yu, do you think that you can fight against so many people with the divine artifact in your hand?”

Shui Yuan laughed frantically and said.

“Qin Yu, you still have a chance to live if you hand over the divine artifact now. Otherwise, I’ll let you taste the punishment your friend has received.”

Nangong Qi also said coldly.

“With just trash like you guys?”

A massive column of fire dragged Qin Yu up, and he floated in the air like a god.

The fire shield enveloped him, and the intense heat forced back all the treasures that struck it.

He raised his left hand high, and all his chaotic power surged in.

His left fist emitted a bright red light. The land of the Fire Unicorn Continent suddenly started shaking.

Qin Yu closed his eyes. With the help of the unicorn’s inner core, he seemed to feel all the power of fire in the entire Fire Unicorn Continent. The fire elements were like friends rushing toward him.

He pointed with both hands and hundreds of streams of lava shot into the sky.

A river of lava gradually formed in the sky, and the terrifying heat seemed to melt people.

The surging lava flipped and churned in the air.

Shui Yuan’s hands could not help but tremble. This was almost the power of heaven and earth, the power to reverse the Path of Heaven!

“Die, all of you! Wrath of the unicorn!”

Qin Yu’s expression was indifferent. The moment his palm descended…

A loud unicorn’s roar reverberated through heaven and earth, and the blood river suddenly poured down.

Countless cultivators instantly melted into bones. At the last moment, Shui Yuan used Blood Escape to escape into the void straightaway.

The space shook violently. The lave fell to the ground for a long time and turned into rocks. The entire terrain of the Fire Unicorn Continent changed completely.

With a single attack, he killed nearly a hundred cultivators. Only less than ten people had the means to escape from the Fire Unicorn Continent. However, they were scared out of their wits and scrambled to escape.

Qin Yu sat on the top of the volcano like a god of war.

His face was ashen. This attack drained all of his chaotic power.

Countless fire elements gathered toward his body, turning into pure chaotic power that surged into his body.

Qin Yu split a portion of it into the Sumeru ring to speed up the recovery of the people inside.

With the help of the unicorn’s inner core and in the flame space of the Fire Unicorn Continent…

This absorption speed was comparable to the absorption of the spirit essence. Qin Yu thus was not worried about the over-consumption of the chaotic power.
