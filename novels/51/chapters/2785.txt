Chapter 2786: The Assembly of Creepy

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“I haven’t awakened it yet. The cultivation techniques in my body are too complicated. It’s not that easy to awaken the peak power.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly.

“That’s true. The cultivation of the elf race is mainly based on the wind element. It wasn’t that difficult for me to awaken peak power.”

Aiden nodded. Both he and Chang Mang were similar.

Their fighting style rarely changed, so it wasn’t difficult for them to awaken their peak power.

“The Demon King once told me that if you can’t awaken the peak power, you should only choose one type of power and not use other cultivation techniques. This might help to awaken the peak power. This is one of the solutions. If you awaken the peak power in this way, your strength will be terrifyingly powerful.”

Aiden said after a moment of hesitation.

“There was once a Night Elf Ranger among the elven race. He was a descendant of the humans and elves. He wandered in the Saint World and cultivated different cultivation techniques at the same time. After awakening the peak power, his strength shocked even the queen. If it wasn’t for Lord Immortal Crane stopping him, I’m afraid the queen’s throne would have been taken in the previous war!”

Aiden told Qin Yu all the secrets of the elven race, hoping to help him.

“Thank you very much.”

Qin Yu pondered for a while before he regained his senses and thanked Aiden.

Aiden’s information was indeed good news. Practicing different martial arts simultaneously wouldn’t completely stop the eruption of peak power, but the difficulty would increase.

In the following time, Qin Yu also participated in the battle.

However, his current improvement was minimal. Reaching the pinnacle of level 9 was already a threshold.

This kind of improvement was the maximum without awakening the peak power.

Suddenly, Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically.

He entered the space ring with a flash.

At this moment, Meng Jing spat out a large mouthful of black blood. She was in an extremely dispirited state.

He took half a healing elixir and put it into Meng Jing’s mouth.

However, it was difficult for her to swallow it. Qin Yu checked her body’s condition and his expression instantly became extremely ugly.

If she were an ordinary person, she would have been dead by now. However, there seemed to be a mysterious power hanging on to her at this moment, protecting her last bit of strength.

If the Saint Kingdom’s power continued to weaken, she would probably never wake up again.

Furthermore, even the other two leaders of the Guardian of Order were no match for Chen Zhisha.

The Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom could only silently decline if it could not stop this terrifying enemy.

His strength was also not what the current Qin Yu and the others could resist.

“I have to send the holy daughter back first. Perhaps her injuries will take a longer time to act up when she returns there.”

That might be the place where the holy daughter was born.

Although there was no huge Saint Power, perhaps returning to that place would also make her divine soul more stable.

“I’m afraid it’s too late now!”

Aiden’s expression turned ugly.

Countless rays of light shattered as if Meng Jing had just woken up.

The bottom of the Nine Nether Cliff had completely returned to its original appearance.

Flags were stuck in the broken arms.

These flags were painted with ancient characters that he could not understand. Some of them were blurred and could not be seen clearly.

As a gust of wind blew past, the scene turned into a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood again.

In the next moment, the scene became the stairs of the Nine Nether Cliff again.

The scenes they saw were dazzling. Qin Yu and the others could not tell what kind of changes had occurred for a moment.

Qin Yu observed the scene in front of him intently. He could see almost all the changes at a glance. Countless information surged into his mind and he analyzed it crazily.

Suddenly, a red light descended and a strange light enveloped everyone.

A burst of sorrowful music suddenly sounded and a large group of paper pricks floated in the air.

These paper pricks smeared their lips and eyes with particularly bright blood, then slowly floated past them.

What made Qin Yu’s hair stand on end was that when these paper pricks touched them, they could feel the thinness of the paper.

Was this not a f*cking illusion?

“F*ck! Look, they seem to be carrying a big red sedan! I’m a little scared. Qin

Yu, can we leave first?”

Chang Mang felt his hair stand on end upon seeing this incongruous scene. Goosebumps ran all over his body.

Qin Yu could see a woman in red sitting in the frightening red palanquin.

The person wearing the red veil like a bride waiting to be married inadvertently fluttered, revealing a face as pale as paper.

Qin Yu could tell at first glance that this woman was not alive.

This scene was peculiar. It was similar to the mixed handling of weddings and funerals on Earth.

Moreover, the three of them seemed to have suffered serious injuries to their divine souls after that group of people passed by.

Other than Qin Yu’s divine soul which was relatively stronger, the other two people’s faces instantly turned pale.

Aiden moved his finger and hundreds of vortexes appeared behind him.

The rain of arrows pierced forward.

“Don’t waste your energy. This should be the power of Creepy, just like the ones we saw before. However, this Creepy is extremely powerful. What we saw was only their consciousness materializing. That includes the last woman in red. Since she could instantly create an impact on us, her strength is probably unfathomable. ”

Qin Yu realized that after the incident just now.

The light covering them did not disappear but became extremely solid.

Layer after layer, they had already fallen into a Creepy quagmire.

Moreover, every Creepy here was countless times stronger than the ones they had encountered before.

Any Creepy consciousness here seemed to be able to materialize.

This kind of strength was not something that the Creepy of their previous battle could compare to.

Break the illusion!

Qin Yu’s Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze suddenly erupted with intense light.

Countless murderous intentions were hidden in this chaotic magnetic field.

If Chang Mang and Aiden were in their current state, they would have been killed easily.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

With Qin Yu’s Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze as the center, the white water wave slowly radiated to the surroundings.

Countless chaotic lines returned to calm under the impact of this illusory breaking power.

Everything returned to the previous scene.

As the power of this layer of gaze slowly fluctuated, the chaotic scene finally slowly disappeared.

Countless clear ‘people’ appeared in front of them.

“Qin Ji! Smoker Xie!”

Aiden’s expression was solemn.

Qin Yu’s expression was also solemn. Qin Ji was the person who had fought Aiden previously.

Her head was taken off by the number one kulapati, Bai Zizai at that time. He didn’t expect her to survive..
