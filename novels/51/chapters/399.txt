“Treasure?” Qin Yu’s eyes flashed with excitement.

“Yes! Let’s go! I’ll take you there!” Xiao Yu held Qin Yu’s hand and walked towards the depths of the huge pit.

This huge pit was cylindrical from top to bottom, but when they reached the bottom of the huge pit, it was completely different.

It was flat ground inside, and in the depths of the flat ground, there was a stone house that was neither big nor small.

The house was blocked by the stone door. Under normal circumstances, such a stone door would definitely set a restriction.

For example, a top-grade killing formation or various traps.

However, what surprised Qin Yu was that this stone door didn’t have any restriction at all.

Even when Xiao Yu walked over, the stone door would open automatically.

The door slowly opened amidst a series of loud bangs.

Behind this stone door, there was a huge throne.

On the throne, there was a dim light.

Xiao Yu pointed at the light in front of her and said, “That’s it!”

After saying that, she excitedly ran towards the light.

Qin Yu followed closely behind and came in front of the throne.

Updates by

On the throne, there was a mask.

When Qin Yu saw the mask, his expression couldn’t help but change.

“This... This is the ghost face in the sky?” Qin Yu’s eyes widened!

For some reason, Qin Yu felt a chill on his back!

It was as if he was being stared at by countless pairs of eyes. That kind of uneasiness even made Qin Yu tremble!

“This is it. Although I don’t know what it can do, it’s definitely not a common object.” Xiao Yu stroked her chin.

Qin Yu frowned and reached out his hand to touch the mask.

At this moment, a huge force sent Qin Yu flying!

“Boom!”

The huge force shocked everyone! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The stone wall behind Qin Yu was smashed into pieces! A huge boulder smashed into Qin Yu’s body!

“Qin Yu! Are you alright?!” Xiao Yu hurriedly ran over.

Qin Yu pushed aside the huge rock and walked out of the stone mound.

He shook his head and said, “I’m fine. This mask... seems to have set some kind of restriction.”

After saying that, Qin Yu walked to the front of the mask and tried to pick up the mask for the second time.

However, the result was the same as the first time. Qin Yu was sent flying!

Moreover, the force was a few times stronger than it was the first time!

Even Qin Yu’s indestructible body was left with white marks!

“How could this be?” Qin Yu’s expression was a little ugly.

Xiao Yu frowned and said, “That can’t be right.”

As she spoke, Xiao Yu stretched out her small hand and grabbed the mask.

“Don’t! Don’t move!” Qin Yu shouted anxiously!

But it was too late! Xiao Yu’s hand had already reached for the mask!

Something that surprised Qin Yu happened.

Xiao Yu easily took the mask off the throne! There was no resistance at all!

“This is obviously quite easy to take,” Xiao Yu mumbled as she played with the mask.

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Could it be... ? ... Only a pure dark energy body could take this mask off?

“Here, take it.” Xiao Yu handed the mask to Qin Yu.

While holding the mask, Qin Yu could clearly feel an ancient internal qi gushing toward him!

This internal qi almost enveloped Qin Yu, and it even affected Qin Yu’s divine sense!

In an instant, countless images flashed through Qin Yu’s mind!

Although this image was fleeting, it made Qin Yu’s back go cold!

That terrifying murderous aura was definitely not something Qin Yu could withstand!

“This is definitely not some ordinary item,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice as he held the mask.

“Of course! The treasure that I discovered is definitely not an ordinary item!” Xiao Yu said proudly.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He tried to put the mask on his face.

The moment he put it on, Qin Yu’s face felt an intense burning sensation!

It was as if his entire face was about to be torn apart. It was extremely painful!

“Ah!”

Qin Yu hurriedly took off the mask from his face and threw it to the side.

“What’s wrong?” Xiao Yu asked with a puzzled look.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything.

His mind raced.

Could it be... that this mask was a natural fit with Xiao Yu?

Or perhaps... It was like the stairway to heaven, which required approval?

“Xiao Yu, try wearing this mask.” Thinking of this, Qin Yu hurriedly looked at Xiao Yu.

Xiao Yu picked up the mask and muttered, “This is too ugly. I’m such a beautiful little girl, so wearing it will affect my image...”

Even though that was the case, she still obediently put the mask on her face.

The moment she put it on, rays of light burst out from the mask!

“Xiao Yu!” Qin Yu hurriedly shouted.

Xiao Yu didn’t react at all. Qin Yu tried to pull the mask off, but he found that it was as if the mask grew on Xiao Yu’s face. It couldn’t be removed at all!

“Phew...”

A gentle breeze blew past.

On the mask, specks of light flickered.

A moment later, the mask wrapped around Xiao Yu!

Her entire body floated in the air and was enveloped by the dark light!

“Whoosh!”

Another gust of chilly wind blew past!

The specks of light actually formed a slender figure in the air above Xiao Yu!

This figure’s long hair fluttered in the wind and her figure was slender. The internal qi from the ancient times was difficult to conceal.

And she was wearing this mask on her face!

The scene only flashed by for a moment, but it made Qin Yu’s entire body tremble!

It was as if his entire body couldn’t withstand this internal qi, and he was going to kneel down and worship at any time!

The light slowly disappeared, and Xiao Yu also fell from the sky.

She took off the mask and muttered, “What a strange feeling.”

“Are you okay?” Qin Yu couldn’t hide his shock.

Xiao Yu shook her head and said, “I’m fine. It’s like I had a dream.”

“What kind of dream?” Qin Yu hurriedly asked.

Xiao Yu shook her head and said, “I don’t remember.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything.

But his heart was in turmoil.

Could it be... There was a connection between this mask and Xiao Yu?

Or... Xiao Yu was the owner of this mask? The mask was left behind by Xiao Yu in her previous life?

The silhouette of that light just now was really similar to Xiao Yu’s figure.

The only difference was that there seemed to be a stark contrast in terms of personality and temperament.

“Hey, what are you thinking about?” Xiao Yu patted Qin Yu’s shoulder.

Qin Yu came back to his senses. He shook his head and said, “Xiao Yu, keep this mask for yourself. Maybe it will be useful to you.”

“Me?” Xiao Yu pointed at herself and then hurriedly shook her head. “No, no, no. It’s too ugly. How can people appreciate my peerless appearance with this mask on...”

“Screw you.” Qin Yu rolled his eyes at Xiao Yu.

“Be obedient. This mask is definitely not some ordinary thing. It might be of great use to you in the future,” Qin Yu said with a serious expression.

It was precisely because of this mask that Xiao Yu’s life had changed.

No one would have thought that this mischievous girl would become a devil that everyone feared.
