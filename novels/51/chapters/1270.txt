Chapter 1271: Chapter 1,271, the first large sum of money 

Jing Bai’s expression was extremely strange.

He sized up Qin Yu from head to toe, as if he couldn’t believe that this was real.

“You Said... you killed the Spirit Monarch Lion?”Jing Bai said with a frown.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “That’s right. The price of this spirit monarch lion is five hundred thousand spirit coins, right?”

Jing Bai nodded slightly and said, “As long as you really killed the Spirit Monarch Lion, money isn’t a problem.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He immediately took out the spirit monarch lion from the spatial magic artifact.

A huge body fell out of the spatial magic artifact.

The huge spirit monarch lion immediately attracted the attention of almost the entire hunter organization.

Everyone heard the news and came over. When they saw this mighty spirit monarch lion, their jaws almost dropped.

“Damn, Spirit Monarch Lion!”

“Guan Zhuang, your trip was worth it. You actually brought back the Spirit Monarch Lion.”

“It wasn’t me who killed it. It was this little brother called Qin Yu who killed it.”Guan Zhuang waved his hand repeatedly.

The group of Brawny men looked at Qin Yu in shock. They put their arms around Qin Yu’s shoulders and said with a smile, “Little brother, you’re good. This beast has killed quite a number of our people.”

“That’s right, Qin Yu. Tell me, how did you kill this beast? Don’t tell me you have a Babe on you?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I used my fist to beat it to death.”

“Fist? Haha, don’t Joke Around.”The surrounding people couldn’t help but tease him.

Qin Yu didn’t want to explain to them, so he just laughed it off.

After that, Qin Yu looked at Jing Bai and said, “When can you give me the money?”

Jing Bai went up to check and then walked to Qin Yu and said, “Let’s go. You follow me to go through the procedures.”

Qin Yu grunted and followed Jing Bai to a certain room.

Jing Bai took out a form and asked Qin Yu to fill it out. Then, he took out a black card that was shining with light.

“The spirit coins are all on this card. It’s a total of 450,000,”Jing Bai said.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “450,000? Isn’t it 500,000?”

“This is the rule of the hunter organization. 10% of it will be handed over to the hunter organization to be used for daily expenses, such as updating equipment and so on. The rest will also be used for charity,”Jing Bai explained.

Qin Yu nodded slightly. He said with some doubt, “Then what if the reward is not money, but spiritual artifacts or natural treasures?”

“If it is not money, there will be no fees,”Jing Bai said.

“I understand,”Qin Yu agreed.

Jing Bai looked up at Qin Yu and said, “How did you kill this beast?”

“I really used my fists,”Qin Yu said helplessly.

Jing Bai Looked Qin Yu up and down and found that there was no fluctuation of internal Qi in Qin Yu’s body.

“Special Constitution?”Jing Bai whispered.

“By the way, don’t you have a few difficult orders with you? Leave them to me,”Qin Yu said to Jing Bai.

Jing bai frowned and said, “These orders are extremely dangerous. Aren’t you afraid that something will happen?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “No worries. Even if I can’t complete the mission, I can at least protect myself.”

Seeing this, Jing Bai didn’t say anything more.

He handed the remaining orders that gave him a headache to Qin Yu.

“If you really complete these orders, then you will probably take the position of the current number one hunter,”said Jing Bai.

“Number one hunter? Who Is It?”Asked Qin Yu. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Jing Bai said in a deep voice, “Of course it’s Jin Lun. So far, he has killed at least a hundred demonic beasts, and every one of them is powerful.”

“And Jin Lun’s own realm has already stepped into the late-stage of the Almighty Realm. He can be considered one of the best in the Hunter Organization.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly.

The higher the realm, the greater the gap between them.

Although early-stage and middle-stage mighty figures appeared to be only one realm apart, they were actually quite a few minor realms apart.

Just like the first level of a mighty figure and the fifth level of a mighty figure, the difference between them was like a natural moat.

‘If I think about it, I don’t think I’ve met anyone at the middle-stage of a mighty figure before,’Qin Yu thought to himself.

Even that protector was still quite a distance away from the middle-stage of a mighty figure.

“Speaking of which, the heavenly cloud sect seems to have sent three people at the mid-stage of the Almighty realm this time.”Qin Yu whispered to himself.

Apart from those three at the mid-stage of the Almighty Realm, there was also a youth who was known as the number one person in the southern prefecture.

Rumor has it that although this youth was at the early-stage of the Almighty realm, his strength wasn’t inferior to the mid-stage of the Almighty Realm.

Therefore, the heavenly cloud sect was equivalent to sending four people at the mid-stage of the Almighty Realm.

This level of strength was enough to intimidate any city.

“Oh right, Big Brother Jing Bai, I have something to ask of you.”At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly said.

Jing Bai nodded, indicating for Qin Yu to continue.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “I don’t know if the hunter organization can issue a notice or a reward.”

“Why, do you have something you want?”Jing Bai quickly saw through Qin Yu’s intentions.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “That’s right. I urgently need the life energy.”

“Life Energy?”Jing Bai frowned slightly. “This thing is not easy to find. Rumor has it that most of the life energy exists in the depths of the green rock forest, but no one can go deep into the Green Rock Forest. That area has long become a restricted area.”

“Other than the depths of the Green Rock Forest, is there no other source?”Qin Yu frowned and said.

“Yes, of course there is. Many natural treasures contain the aura of life, but it is rare,”said Jing Bai.

At this point, Jing Bai looked at Qin Yu and continued, “If there is any news, I will inform you. Of course, I will also use my personal ability to help you ask around.”

Qin Yu cupped his hands and said, “Then thank you very much.”

After saying that, Qin Yu walked out of the room.

He rubbed the card in his hand and said in a low voice, “With this money, even if I leave the hunter organization, I can at least guarantee my life.”

This card was quite similar to the bank cards on Earth. The only difference was that this card was made using some kind of spell.

Not only that, this card needed to be recognized as its owner by a drop of blood. After the drop of blood, no one but the owner could open it. It was relatively safer.
