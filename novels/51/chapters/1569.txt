Chapter 1570: Chapter 1,570, a clone? ! 1

The godly monarch struggled with all his might, his mouth begging for help.

However, the two godly monarchs could no longer protect themselves, so how could they care?

His body was swallowed into the black hole, and then disappeared without a trace!

The remaining two people’s bodies also approached at an extremely fast speed!

The crowd watching from afar could not help but turn pale with fright.

How long had it been since the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s sect master had made a move? This Rashomon had already become a legend!

“The Rashomon is indeed worthy of its reputation.”Someone Sighed.

“Could it be that the three godly monarchs of the northern lands are going to perish here?”

“It’s truly unbelievable.”

Just as the two godly monarchs were about to be swallowed into the Rashomon, the sect master’s body suddenly began to dissipate!

And his Rashomon sect also disappeared!

The two godly monarchs were instantly overjoyed. They were gasping for breath with unspeakable excitement in their eyes!

“Hahahaha! This is heaven’s will! Heavenly Cloud Sect’s sect master, you’re dead meat!”A godly monarch roared crazily!

......

The sect master did not say a word. He only watched as his body slowly dissipated.

“Sect master... is really going to die.”Someone said with a trembling voice.

“How is this possible... how can sect master die! ?”

And the deputy sect master’s expression was the ugliest. His body, which had already been shattered, began to separate due to the pain.

“The Heavenly Cloud sect has already become history,”a godly monarch said coldly.

They watched helplessly as the sect master’s body slowly disappeared until it completely disappeared!

Just as the two godly kings were excited, a stone fell to the ground.

The stone was colorful and looked like a divine stone, extremely dazzling.

“Eh?”A godly king found the stone.

He walked forward quickly and took the stone in his hand.

When he saw the stone clearly, his face turned extremely ugly!

“This... This is the feather-turning divine stone!”The Godly King said in a trembling voice.

“Divine Stone of Feather?”The other godly king was also stunned, and then he walked over quickly!

He took the stone and looked at it carefully.

Before he could see it clearly, the stone had already begun to crack and finally completely shatter!

The faces of the two people became increasingly pale, and they even had some lingering fear.

The onlookers seemed to have also noticed the stone.

“Divine Stone of feather? Is it the stone that is said to be able to create avatars?”

“In other words... The one who fought with the three godly monarchs just now was not the sect master of the Tianyun sect himself? It was just one of his avatars?”

“How is this possible... just one of his avatars nearly killed the three godly monarchs. How terrifying is the sect master of the Tianyun sect...”

The most terrifying thing was none other than the two godly monarchs.

Their expressions were solemn as their bodies trembled.

“The one who fought us... was not his true body at all...”one of the godly monarchs lamented.

They had never expected that the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect would use a avatar to force them to such an extent!

More importantly, they had lost a godly monarch!

“It seems that Sima bei is not exaggerating,”said a godly monarch in a low voice.

“Fortunately, the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect is not on the cultivation mountain. Otherwise...”

The consequences were unimaginable! It was likely that all three of them would die here!

“It’s not good to stay here for long. No one knows if he’s nearby,”said a godly monarch coldly at this moment.

The two exchanged glances and immediately left the heavenly cloud sect.

Only after they left did the many disciples rush up the Cultivation Mountain. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Looking at the Cultivation Mountain that was in a mess, everyone sighed with emotion.

“The Cultivation Mountain is the place where the sect master went into seclusion. Now, it has been reduced to ruins. It really makes people sigh endlessly.”

“That’s not the point. The point is where did the sect master go? Why did he leave behind only an avatar? Isn’t he in seclusion?”

“Could it be that the sect leader has gone to tour the world?”

It wasn’t just them. Many onlookers were also speculating.

After all, the sect leader of the Tianyun sect had been in seclusion for a long time. How could they not be shocked when they couldn’t see his true body.

“The sect leader of the Tianyun sect is probably much more terrifying than we imagined.”

“Now that I think about it, Yongji is like a joke. He’s such a good-for-nothing, yet he still dares to covet the Tianyun Sect.”

“After this battle, I’m afraid the northern lands will have to think about it.”

...

The northern border was still extremely calm.

For the past few days, the northern lands did not make any movements.

On the side of the Dead River, Xiao Hai would occasionally look at the other side as if he was trying to sense something.

However, the other side of the Dead River was completely silent. No one could be seen.

“Senior Xiao Hai.”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly walked over.

Xiao Hai looked at Qin Yu and then said with a sigh, “I wonder what kind of bad idea this northern land is thinking.”

“Perhaps after the last battle, they don’t dare to act recklessly anymore,”said Qin Yu.

Xiao Hai shook his head and said, “Impossible. Once the northern land makes a move, they will never stop. Because this is the best opportunity for them.”

Qin Yu also felt that it made sense. He asked, “Senior Xiao Hai, do you have any idea about the formation that you have deduced?”

“I’m still a little short,”Xiao Hai said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu tried to say, “Why don’t you tell me about this formation? I might be able to help.”

However, Xiao Hai shook his head and didn’t accept Qin Yu’s opinion.

“I’m afraid that several people are needed to activate this formation. At that time, I’m afraid I’ll have to ask for your help,”Xiao Hai looked at Qin Yu and said.

Qin Yu agreed, “Senior Xiao Hai, don’t worry. The cultivators of the South Province have already initiated their own initiative to resist the invaders from the north.”

Xiao Hai said in a deep voice, “I’m afraid the few of us are far from enough to win this battle.”

“That’s right.”Qin Yu sighed.

“The South Province doesn’t lack top-notch martial artist. For example, Qu Zhu, the monk of Hongxi, and even the sect master of the Tianyun sect. They all have the ability to hold their own, but they’re unwilling to step forward,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Xiao Hai did not say much about this. He only looked towards the north, thinking of something.

“Senior Xiao Hai, do you know the sect master of the Tianyun Sect?”At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly asked.

Hearing this, Xiao Hai turned to look at Qin Yu.

At the same time, Qin Yu also activated the desolate divine eye, as though he wanted to secretly peek at the face under the mask.

However, what surprised Qin Yu was that there was nothing under the mask.

It was unknown what kind of secret technique was used to block even the desolate divine eye.

“I only know that he is a very powerful person,”said Xiao Hai.

Qin Yu tried to ask, “What about compared to you? Who is stronger?”

Xiao Hai was stunned. After a long while, he shook his head and said, “I have not fought before, so I don’t dare to make a conclusion.”

Qin Yu acknowledged and then asked, “Senior Xiao Hai, there’s actually a question that I’m more curious about.”

Xiao Hai didn’t say anything, as if he was waiting for Qin Yu’s follow-up.

“Why do you always wear a mask?”Qin Yu asked in puzzlement.
