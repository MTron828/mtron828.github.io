Chapter 781: Killing Two People! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“In other words, some people are here for the pill formula?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and asked.

“That’s right, so you have to be careful.” Xue Yuzhi nodded with a smile.

She didn’t know what Qin Yu was thinking. In her opinion, Qin Yu must have the pill formula.

“By the way, Auntie Xue, do you know who has the pill formula among these people? I want to know who my competitors are,” Qin Yu lied.

Xue Yuzhi smiled and said, “Although there are many people here today, you only need to pay attention to two people.”

“One is called Hou Xin, and the other is called Wen Sheng,” Xue Yuzhi said.

Qin Yu silently memorized these two names and nodded. “Okay, Auntie Xue, I got it.”

“Well, hurry up. You only have three days,” Xue Yuzhi said.

After saying that, Xue Yuzhi got up and left.

After she left, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer. “Snatching things? I’m the best at it.”

Late at night.

The entire courtyard was silent.

And under this silence, there was danger lurking.

Who knew how many people were filled with killing intent and preparing to snatch the formula for the concentric pill?

Qin Yu got up and strode out of the house.

He restrained his internal qi and rushed towards Hou Xin’s residence.

During the day, Qin Yu had already inquired about Hou Xin’s residence, so it wasn’t difficult to find Hou Xin.

He came all the way to Hou Xin’s residence.

The moment he got close, Qin Yu felt several internal qi surrounding him.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and couldn’t help but sneer. “Looks like someone has already made a move.”

Qin Yu looked at the door and found a few footprints.

Obviously, someone had already made a move.

He wasn’t in a hurry to make a move. Instead, he waited silently nearby.

A few minutes later.

Hou Xin’s door was easily opened by someone. Then, two Martial Marquises strode in!

Hou Xin, who was about to sleep, was suddenly startled. He hurriedly got up and said with some fear, “What are you doing?”

Hou Xin wasn’t very strong. He was only at the peak of the Grandmaster realm.

Facing two Martial Marquises, he had no way to fight back!

“What are we doing? Hand over your concentric pill formula!” One of the Martial Marquises said coldly.

“Otherwise, today will be the day of your death!”

Hou Xin’s face was pale. He said with fear, “I... I don’t have the concentric pill formula! Don’t act recklessly!”

“No? Bullsh*t! The outside world knows that you have the formula for the concentric pill!” One of the Martial Marquises shouted.

The other Martial Marquis took a step forward and grabbed Hou Xin’s neck.

The huge force instantly made Hou Xin unable to breathe.

Blue veins bulged on his forehead as he said with a pained expression, “I... I really don’t have the formula for the concentric pill...”

“You still want to argue? Fine! If you don’t hand over the formula for the concentric pill today, then you can go to hell!” Wu Hou shouted sternly as the strength in his hands suddenly increased!

Under this tremendous force, blue veins bulged on Hou Xin’s face, and his entire face turned red and swollen!

“You want to kill someone just because you can’t snatch something?”

At this moment, a voice entered their ears.

They turned around and saw that it was Qin Yu.

He sized up the two Martial Marquises in front of him and said, “Put him down.”

One of the Martial Marquises said coldly, “Who are you? I’m warning you, you better mind your own business!”

Qin Yu sneered. “I told you to put him down.”

“I think you’re courting death!” One of the Martial Marquises shouted angrily and then rushed towards Qin Yu!

His claws iwere incomparably sharp, and headed towards Qin Yu’s head!

Qin Yu looked coldly at this Martial Marquis, and then threw a punch.

“Boom!”

With just this punch, that Martial Marquis’ palm was instantly shattered!

Before he could speak, Qin Yu’s golden palm had already slapped over.

“Crack!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

This slap smashed that Martial Marquis’ head into pieces!

Qin Yu bent down and took out the golden pill from his stomach, then threw his body to the side.

The other Martial Marquis’s face instantly turned pale. He let go of Hou Xin and said coldly, “Bro, you should also be here for the concentric pill, right? Why don’t we work together and force this kid to hand over the concentric pill. How about it?”

Qin Yu touched his chin and muttered, “This is a good choice...”

“No... no...” Hou Xin panicked and looked at Qin Yu with a terrified expression.

“Cut the crap!” The Martial Marquis slapped Hou Xin’s face.

Then, he looked at Qin Yu and said with a smile, “Bro, I have many ways to torture people. I guarantee that I can get him to hand over the recipe for the concentric pill!”

Qin Yu looked at Martial Marquis in front of him and said with a smile, “Your suggestion is good, but... I don’t want to cooperate with you.”

“What do you mean?!” Martial Marquis’s expression suddenly changed!

Qin Yu said coldly, “I mean to kill you.”

“How dare you! Do you know what kind of person I am!” Martial Marquis shouted.

“I am a member of the Purple Flame Sect! If you kill me, I guarantee that you won’t be able to leave Sheng Kingdom!”

Qin Yu sneered. “Purple Flame Sect? I hate people who threaten me the most!”

After saying that, Qin Yu gave him a slap, smashing his head!

In the blink of an eye, he had killed two Martial Marquises. This kind of strength left Hou Xin dumbstruck!

He trembled slightly as he said, “Thank... Thank you...”

Qin Yu didn’t pay attention to him. He kept the two golden pills and then with a gentle wave of his hand, the door closed.

Qin Yu walked to Hou Xin and sat down. He said with a smile, “How about giving me the formula for the concentric pill? Of course, you can name the conditions.”

Hou Xin’s expression changed. He said with a bitter smile, “Sir, I really don’t have the formula for the concentric pill...”

“You don’t?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

“But it’s being spread outside that you have the formula, not to mention... with your strength, if you don’t have the formula for the concentric pill, why would you take this risk?”

Hou Xin was silent for a moment, then sighed and said, “To tell you the truth, I only have one substitute, which is also used to remove poison. What I want is to try my luck.”

“If my pill can only be used by Old Master Xue, then this trip won’t be in vain. But I never thought that it would lead to a fatal disaster...”

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

He frowned and said, “Do you really not have the formula for the concentric pill?”

Hou Xin nodded vigorously and said, “I really don’t! But... Wen Sheng seems to have it.”

“How do you know?” Qin Yu frowned and said.

Hou Xin stammered and said, “I also heard it from others.”

At this point, Hou Xin suddenly changed the topic and said, “You saved my life, so I owe you a favor. Although I don’t have the formula for the concentric pill, I can give you my substitute pill formula.”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said in surprise, “Really?”

“Absolutely!” Hou Xin nodded and said.
