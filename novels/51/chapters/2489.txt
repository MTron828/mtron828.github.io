2490 The Allegiance of the Gu Family

Gu Ning’s expression was pale as she softly transmitted her voice.

Behind her were many people of the Gu family dressed in white, with white hemp ribbons on their heads.

They seemed to reminisce about the people of the Gu family who had passed away.

When the formation opened, the 3,000 people Gu Ning brought with her did not enter except her and Saintess Gu.

“Where is Senior Baiyi?”

Seeing Gu Baiyi not among them, Qin Yu had a premonition in his heart.

“Martial Uncle has already passed away. Withstanding Xiao Sheng’s punch of heaven and earth has surpassed her limit. Her body has suffered a severe injury. Even the Gu family’s celestial artifact, the Heart of the Ocean, could not heal her injuries. She would never be able to cultivate again. Under such a blow, Martial Uncle passed away yesterday.”

After saying this, Saintess Gu could no longer hold back her tears.

“Senior Sister has always been strong-willed. Despite being a woman, she stands as tall as many men in the world. Even if she dies today, she dies standing, with no regrets, no need for grief.”

Gu Ning did not look sad at all.

“Qin Yu, I intend to let all the members of the Gu family join Human Race Watch Overwatch. I wonder what your higher-ups would think?”

“Human Race Watch was established as an alliance for humanity itself, not for internal conflict. Just like our support for the Gu family this time. It would be best if you could accept it. However, if you still want to create internal intrigue, forming different factions within, there’s no need to join.”

Qin Yu said directly. The 3,000 cultivators of the Gu family joining meant their strength would be enormous.

Including the Supreme Elders of the Gu family, there were as many as six Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivators.

Among them, nearly 500 were True Saints. Would these people take instruction without reservation after joining?

Qin Yu smiled bitterly.

It would definitely cause a huge commotion if these 3,000 cultivators joined other forces. It was a huge battle force, and others would take out a vast amount of resources to attract them. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

However, to Qin Yu and the others, Human Race Watch was not an alliance that fought for hegemony and benefits.

The resources they had obtained previously were divided equally within the alliance.

They were not affluent, and the current situation was more about spending without income. They could not provide any benefits either.

“Our Gu family isn’t here for those things. Saintess Gu will lead our Gu family members. However, if there is any need for support, the Gu family will not stay behind, nor will we be the ones who backstab you. I, Gu Ning, swear on the honor of my Gu family’s ancestors.”

Gu Ning knew what Qin Yu was worried about, so she said that directly to clear his doubts.

“Gu Ning, you’re not responsible for Gu Baiyi’s death. What do you mean by doing this?”

Lei Xin frowned. He suddenly felt that Gu Ning was entrusting him with tasks related to her passing.

“Don’t worry. I’m not that weak. It’s just that there are conditions for the Gu family to join in. I want you to accompany me to the Azure Rock Forest. Qin Yu, do you dare to do so?”

Gu Ning suddenly pointed at Qin Yu and asked.

“Go to the Azure Rock Forest? Are you crazy? The internal situation in the Azure Rock Forest is under tight control. Everything, from the birds in the sky to a caterpillar on the ground, could be the eyes and ears of the demon race. Isn’t that walking into a death trap?”

Flower Granny immediately rejected Gu Ning’s suggestion.

“Don’t worry. Without confidence, I wouldn’t have mentioned such a ridiculous thing.”

Gu Ning stretched out her palm, and a gem appeared in her fair palm.

It was the Gu family’s celestial artifact, Heart of the Ocean.

It seemed to contain the vastness and depth of the vast ocean. Its surface was smooth and shiny, emanating a faint smell of seawater.

The moment it appeared, Qin Yu seemed to feel the waves crashing against the shore and the tides surging.

And the moment it appeared, even though Gu Ning was right before him, no one could detect her internal qi no matter how hard they tried.

“I was not in the family this time because I went deep into the Azure Rock Forest to investigate some clues. Therefore, there’s no need to worry about safety. Of course, I have to conceal my internal qi when I go there. If I cause too much commotion, it will attract the demon race’s attention.”

Gu Ning said through the Heart of the Ocean.

Her voice seemed to come from all directions, and it was impossible to figure out where she was.

“No, unless you tell me all the details. Otherwise, I disagree with you bringing Qin Yu into the Azure Rock Forest.”

Lei Xin again rejected the invitation without reason.

Based on Lei Xin’s understanding of Gu Ning, it was most likely not a good thing.

“The demon race is forging a supreme celestial artifact, the Crown of the Demon King. This crown is forged using the crown bone of the ancient tribe Demon Emperor, nurtured by the blood essence of numerous divine beasts. For every interval, the supreme experts of every race will offer sacrifices. Now, this Crown of the Demon King has taken shape. My goal for this trip is to seize it. Even if it doesn’t work, I must destroy it to avenge the monster race’s attack on the Gu family.”

As if she felt not making it clear enough, Gu Ning added.

“There is a huge gap between the power of the demon race and the spiritual power of our human race. I will be noticed immediately if I forcefully seize it. Moreover, I might not be able to subdue it. As for Qin Yu, his chaotic body will not cause a huge backlash when it comes into contact with this crown of the demon race.”

“Gu Ning, many things in your plan are not worth considering. I can’t let Qin Yu die with you.”

Flower Granny said with a frown. Many things did not make sense if one thought about it carefully.

“This trip, I, Saintess Gu of my family, and you, the three of us, will face great danger, including me. However, we also need opportunities to advance. The Crown of the Demon King doesn’t only involve the inheritance of the demon race, but it also contains the cultivation path of the demon race. By merely referring to its information, it will benefit you significantly.”

Gu Ning hesitated and continued, “I have other choices for this trip, but this is what Baiyi told me before she left, and I ended up choosing you. If you reject, just take it as my Gu family has never come today. I won’t force you.”

“I’ll go.”

Hearing the mention of Gu Baiyi’s name, Qin Yu hesitated and then agreed.

Actually, based on the fact that Saintess Gu would go together and the others of the Gu family would stay.

He could tell that Gu Ning did not lie to him, and it was indeed as she said.

Qin Yu was walking the path of anomaly now, but not comparable to Xiao Sheng, who had entered the path of anomaly.

Even Xi Menn’s Way of the Sword was stronger than him.

With the powerful soul power he had gained from condensing the Soul Spirit Bead in purgatory, he could barely draw upon the third or fourth level of the power of the Path of Heaven.

However, he had stuck there. If he dragged on, the people around him would soon catch up to him.

“I’ll set off after I have settled the people of the Gu family. You still have a chance to retract it before you leave. Once you enter the Azure Rock Forest, your life and death will be decided by heaven. I can’t guarantee your safety.”

Gu Ning left after she finished speaking.
