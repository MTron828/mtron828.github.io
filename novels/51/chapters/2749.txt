Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Big Brother, did you kill Gu Ying? We just made a bet on whether you could come in alive. His Ruler’s Power was giving me a headache, but I didn’t expect you to be able to kill him.”

Little Lolita Liu Si asked with a smile.

Luo Yu was also surprised. Although the two forces were enemies and he knew the strength of Gu Ying as one of the four leaders, he did not expect Qin Yu to be able to enter this place.

“I’m just lucky.”

Qin Yu said coldly.

“Qin Yu, I’m sorry. I thought the Book of Wishes could suppress everyone, but I didn’t expect Gu Ying to use the suppression power of Heavenly Sin and the Ruler’s Power on him to resist the Book of Wishes.”

Cang Yunzi apologized.

“It has nothing to do with Taoist priest. That person’s plan is extremely meticulous. He wanted to attack me from the beginning and was even prepared to betray the Guardian of Order. However, everything was in vain in the end.” Qin Yu laughed coldly. He had no intention of hiding it.

Displaying one’s strength appropriately was also a strategy when facing these strong opponents.

“Looks like you have a Dharma Treasure that is even more precious than the one in the Tomb of Heavenly Sins. If you don’t have enough strength, you won’t be able to protect it.”

Luo Yu gently flicked the dagger in his hand. The dagger spun a few times in the air and returned to his palm.

“Do you want it? Come and get it. I’ll treat you my dust again!”

Qin Yu sneered.

“You’re courting death!”

Luo Yu’s expression turned gloomy after Qin Yu mentioned his sore spot again.

“Alright, quiet down. Our goal is not internal strife, but the Tomb of Heavenly Sins in front of us.”

Cang Yunzi frowned slightly.

“I have bad news for everyone. The land of Heavenly Sin this time is different from the previous three times.”

“How is it different?” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Liu Si asked with a smile.

“This one is more powerful compared to the previous one. The first-level divine generals aren’t this powerful. You have to remember that the Tomb of Heavenly Sins appears to punish sinners. It can sense the strength of the sinner’s bloodline.”

Cang Yunzi’s expression was somewhat solemn.

“Could it be that there’s a sinner with an extremely rich bloodline inheritance here? And we’ve been affected when we entered.’

Qin Yu immediately reacted.

“That’s right. Based on the strength of Heavenly Sin, we are confident that we can even pass the third level. We can even try to enter the fourth level. But for now, let’s try to survive.”

Cang Yunzi said with a bitter smile.

Everyone fell into a deathly silence when they heard this. Mist covered the entire huge divine hall.

The sounds of fighting had gradually stopped.

In other words, the nearly 100,000 people who entered here were now less than 3,000 at the second level.

The sticky blood slowly spread to the periphery of the area where they were.

However, the blood that was slowly rising seemed to be blocked by a force. The blood slowly rose.

It was like a rising tide that only stopped when it reached half the height of the divine hall.

This was the terrifying power of Heavenly Sin.

Nearly 100,000 top-notch martial artists had died in the first trial. However, the remaining 3,000 were mostly peak-level Dao Realm level 6 and above.

Many people had even cultivated the peak power. Almost all the top-notch martial artists had gathered here.

Many of them even had a look of fear on their faces.

“It should be related to that blonde woman.”

Seeing the expressions on their faces, Qin Yu secretly guessed.

Who was Lord Alester?

Qin Yu looked at the expressionless woman and felt a little puzzled. “Old man, why are we still unable to enter the next level?”

Little Lolita Liu Si shouted. She was a little impatient from waiting.

“It should be because there are still living beings in the divine hall, so the second level hasn’t been activated yet.”

Cang Yunzi guessed.

The dull sound of footsteps could be heard. A figure dressed in white slowly appeared in front of everyone.

Qin Yu’s heart trembled violently. The person was someone he could not be more familiar with.

Brother Xiao Hai!

The scenes of Nanzhou and North Plain fighting each other appeared in his mind. Even after his death, Xiao Hai still saved his life in the ghost realm.

However, the price he paid seemed to be that he had lost his memory. At this moment, he seemed to have forgotten about Qin Yu.

“What a terrifying power! He can avoid the senses of these divine generals and walk here step by step.”

This was the first time Cang Yunzi was shocked.

“And it’s not the power of the peak. He’s relying on his understanding of the rules here to avoid the prying eyes of these divine generals.”

In such a short period, he was able to find the key to breaking through the situation. Such a heaven-defying talent shocked everyone.

“Sorry for making everyone wait.”

Xiao Hai said with a smile.

For a moment, Qin Yu felt a little dazed. It was as if the scene of her fighting Xiao Hai together was just yesterday.

Xiao Hai stood not far away from Qin Yu in deep thought. He seemed to be deep in thought and did not even notice Qin Yu, who had been staring at him.

“Everyone, I have a suggestion. The situation here is not right. It is even more dangerous than we had previously guessed. I believe that everyone knows about this tomb. Everyone has their opportunities here, so we should try to cooperate. Only then can we defeat the evil Heavenly Sin!”

A fat man said wantonly with saliva flying everywhere.

What surprised Qin Yu was that this person’s strength was pitifully weak. If Qin Yu was not wrong, this fatty should be around Dao Realm level 5 but he had nine guards.

Moreover, each of their internal qi was of full level nine. There was a high chance that they were experts who had cultivated the peak power.

“Fatty, if you have something to say, just say it!”

Someone couldn’t stand it anymore and said impatiently.

“Alright! I suggest we take advantage of the fact that the second level hasn’t been activated yet to exchange our Dharma Treasure. If we can exchange for suitable treasures, won’t the following operation be smoother?” Fatty’s eyes lit up as he grabbed a handful of talismans.

On his other hand, he held a large bag filled with magical artifacts.

When those magical artifacts appeared, they exploded with intense fluctuations.

“Are these all top-notch magical artifacts?”

Qin Yu sensed it carefully and immediately felt that it was very ridiculous. Moreover, Qin Yu could also sense the destructive aura in a few of the talismans. These were talismans drawn by top-notch cultivators.

“Don’t underestimate this fatty..”
