Chapter 1460: Chapter 1,460. Different paths lead to different strategies

Even so, boss Zheng still hid inside and didn’t dare to say a word.

Qin Yu shouted, “If you don’t open the door, I’ll tear down this lousy place for you!”

After hearing this, the door finally opened.

And the person who opened the door was none other than Ding Yi.

She looked at Qin Yu excitedly, her eyes shining like stars.

“Qin Yu...”Ding Yi called out Qin Yu’s name softly.

Qin Yu glanced at her and said with a smile, “Alright, Hurry up and get me a room. I plan to stay here for a few days.”

When Ding Yi heard that, he immediately said excitedly, “Okay, okay, I’ll go now!”

Then, Qin Yu Strode into Anfeng Building.

He went straight to the private room on the second floor and shouted, “Hurry up and get me some food. Bring me all the good food!”

...

Half an hour later.

In the private room on the second floor, the table was filled with delicacies, and boss Zheng was smiling submissively at the side.

As for Qin Yu, he was eating and drinking.

After a full meal, Qin Yu wiped his mouth and stretched. He said, “I’ll be staying here for the next few days. Boss Zheng, do you have any objections?”

Boss Zheng Shivered and said with an embarrassed smile, “Look at what you said. I. . . I don’t dare to have any objections...”

“That’s good.”Qin Yu patted his shoulder and said, “Don’t worry. I Won’t do anything to you. But Don’t disturb me for the next few days.”

“Also, you have a lot of medicinal herbs in Anfeng Tower, right? Send them all to me.”

Boss Zheng smiled apologetically, but he had a hard time saying it in his heart.

As a relative of the great elder, many of the heavenly cloud sect’s medicinal herbs would be stored here.

Now that Qin Yu opened his mouth to ask for them, he didn’t dare to refuse.

Then, Qin Yu went straight to his room.

“This place is really an excellent place for cultivation,”Qin Yu said with a sigh.

He tried to sense the surrounding spiritual energy and found that the spiritual energy here was actually not inferior to that of Mount Hua Ning.

In addition to the medicinal herbs that boss Zheng had sent over, Qin Yu planned to rely on these few days to recover his spiritual energy to its peak and then break through to the Almighty Realm in one go.

As long as he stepped into the Almighty Realm, the eighteen gods Qin Yu was not afraid at all.

A moment later, boss Zheng sent over a large number of medicinal herbs according to Qin Yu’s request.

Qin Yu’s mind moved and he took out the dragon cauldron.

Immediately after, a fiery purple spiritual fire appeared on his palm. The fire danced in his palm and flickered with a demonic radiance. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Qin Yu didn’t waste any time. He used these medicinal herbs to start refining pills.

In the next few days, Qin Yu didn’t leave the room.

Ding Yi stood at the door. He wanted to come in and greet him many times, but he didn’t have the courage.

“Ding Yi, you have to save me.”On this day, boss Zheng found Ding Yi.

He begged bitterly, “You are close to Qin Yu. You have to put in a good word for me...”

Ding Yi said in confusion, “Didn’t he say that he won’t do anything to you...”

“Sigh, how can you believe these people’s Words? They say that they don’t care, but who knows if he will deliberately find trouble...”boss Zheng kept sighing.

Ding Yi snorted, “If you knew it would be like this, why did you inform them? I heard that because of you, one of Qin Yu’s friends died at the hands of the Great Elder.”

Boss Zheng smiled bitterly, “I didn’t expect things to develop to this stage... Ding Yi, you have to help me.”

“Sigh, I’ll try,”Ding Yi said without confidence.

Ever since she found out Qin Yu’s identity, Ding Yi didn’t dare to get close to Qin Yu.

Her heart was very complicated. She wanted to be by Qin Yu’s side, but she was also a little afraid.

Just like these few days, she had always wanted to greet Qin Yu, but she didn’t have the courage.

...

While Qin Yu was cultivating in seclusion, there were more and more operations in the northern lands.

More and more people relied on the teleportation array and the void portal to enter the southern region.

After they arrived at the southern region, they began to burn, kill, and plunder. Men, women, old, and young were all affected.

Especially in the border area, where the cultivators were suffering unspeakably.

Although Xiao Hai was powerful, there were too many people on the other side. He simply couldn’t kill his way over.

As the true controller of the Southern Region, the heavenly cloud sect naturally sent a large number of people to the border. The southern region and the northern region seemed to have begun a direct conflict.

...

A few days later.

Qin Yu finally opened the door to his room.

In his hand, there were dozens of pills.

These pills all contained extremely strong spiritual energy.

However, Qin Yu was not in a hurry to consume them because there was only a week left before the gathering in Yongji City.

Qin Yu planned to set off early and make a trip to the green rock forest first.

Firstly, he had promised Fang Fang that he would bring them to the hunter organization.

Second, he would go to the hunter organization to take revenge.

Then, Qin Yu put away the pills and walked straight to boss Zheng’s office.

Seeing Qin Yu’s figure, boss Zheng couldn’t help but shiver.

He smiled embarrassedly and said, “Qin... Qin Yu, what’s wrong? What’s the matter?”

Qin Yu took out 10,000 spirit coins and slapped it on boss Zheng’s desk.

“Just take it as my accommodation and food expenses for the next few days,”said Qin Yu.

Boss Zheng said with a terrified look, “You’re too kind. It’s my honor for you to come to an Fenglou. I...”

“Alright, stop talking nonsense. I’m leaving today,”Qin Yu interrupted boss Zheng.

Hearing this, boss Zheng was overjoyed.

Although he tried his best to hold back his smile, he couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“Qin Yu, why don’t you stay for a few more days...”boss Zheng said while holding back his laughter.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “If I stay any longer, you might get a heart attack.”

Then, Qin Yu turned around and walked out of the room.

Just as Qin Yu was about to leave, Ding Yi suddenly caught up.

She stood behind Qin Yu and whispered, “Qin Yu, can you take me with you?”

“Take you with me? Why are you following me?”Qin Yu said with a frown.

Ding Yi hurriedly said, “I want to follow you to punish Evil!”

“Punish Evil?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh. “When did you see me punish evil? I killed all my enemies. I never like to meddle in other people’s business.”

“But...”

“There’s no buts. Although I’m not a bad person, I’m definitely not a good person,”Qin Yu interrupted Ding Yi.

“You and I have different beliefs. We can’t be together.”

Ding Yi opened his mouth and wanted to say something, but Qin Yu had already summoned the Divine Eagle.

He stood on the back of the Divine Eagle and flew into the distance.
