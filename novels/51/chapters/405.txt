Yan Haoran hurriedly said, “Auntie, Qin Yu’s strength is extraordinary, and he is unruly and brazen. You... you have to be careful.”

Zhang Yin snickered. “I have seen many unruly and brazen people. In front of me, they have to bow down!”

Yan Haoran didn’t say anything more and could only nod.

...

The next day, after Qin Yu woke up, he couldn’t wait to open the Martial Arts Forum.

He really wanted to know how the Martial Arts Forum would comment on this matter.

But unfortunately, the Martial Arts Forum had no comments.

No one seemed to know about this matter at all.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and muttered, “That can’t be. How can such a big incident cause no uproar?”

“Could it be that the Yan family has blocked the news?” Qin Yu guessed.

With such a big incident, unless the Yan family had ordered the news to be blocked, it was impossible for there to be no news.

After all, the Martial Arts Forum was controlled by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. It was quite possible for the Yan family to order the news to be blocked.

“I have to think of a way to spread this news,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Just as Qin Yu’s thoughts were running wild, his phone suddenly rang.

Updates by

He picked up the phone and saw that the caller was Fang Yue.

Qin Yu hurriedly picked up the phone and said, “Miss Fang.”

Fang Yue smiled nonchalantly and said, “Congratulations, Mr. Qin, for stepping into the Inner Strength Grandmaster Realm.”

Qin Yu raised his brows and said, “How did you know?”

Fang Yue said nonchalantly, “you killed more than ten Inner Strength Grandmasters, so you must have stepped into the Inner Strength Grandmaster Realm.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but smile and say, “Miss Fang is quite well-informed.”

“This kind of thing can’t be concealed even if you want to,” Fang Yue said.

At this point, Fang Yue paused for a moment and continued, “Mr. Qin, do you have time?”

Qin Yu said, “What’s the matter?”

“Let’s meet and talk,” Fang Yue said.

“Okay,” Qin Yu immediately agreed.

Fang Yue told Qin Yu the time and place.

After hanging up the phone, Qin Yu was ready to go.

At this time, an uninvited guest appeared outside the door.

A middle-aged man, his face full of respect, stood in front of Qin Yu.

“Guan Jiarong?” After seeing the person clearly, Qin Yu couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows, and the corners of his mouth curled into a sneer.

Guan Jiarong cupped his hands and said, “Mr. Qin, these are the herbs for you. Please keep them well.”

Looking at the hundred-year-old herbs in his hand, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

“Guan Jiarong, you exploited the Martial Arts Association for your own benefit.”

“Do you think a hundred-year-old herb can make me let it slide?” Qin Yu asked coldly.

Guan Jiarong’s expression changed drastically. He knelt on the ground with a plop and said with fear, “Mr. Qin, I have realized my mistake. I hope... I hope you will spare my life...”

His sudden change in attitude surprised Qin Yu.

He sized up Guan Jiarong and sneered. “Guan Jiarong, what tricks are you playing now?”

Guan Jiarong said with a terrified look, “I wouldn’t dare to... It’s my fault for not knowing your identity. Please spare my life, Mr. Qin...”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly.

He said coldly, “Get lost. I’m warning you. If you mess with me again, I won’t care about your bullsh*t Martial Arts Association when I deal with you!”

“Yes, yes, definitely!” Guan Jiarong hurriedly nodded.

Qin Yu snorted coldly and ignored Guan Jiarong. He immediately drove away.

Looking at Qin Yu’s departing figure, Guan Jiarong couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief.

This morning, he heard that more than a dozen aristocratic families’ heads had been beheaded.

Moreover, the person who attacked was a young man called Qin Yu!

Guan Jiarong was scared out of his wits when he heard the news. He immediately drove over to apologize.

“That was close. I can’t provoke such a madman...” Guan Jiarong muttered in a low voice.

...

Fang Yue had agreed to meet at an open-air restaurant.

When Qin Yu arrived, she had already been waiting for him.

When she saw Qin Yu, Fang Yue waved at him.

“Mr. Qin.” Fang Yue waved.

Qin Yu hurriedly walked to the table and sat down.

He took out the green hat from his Spatial Magic Artifact and handed it to Fang Yue.

“I’ll return it to you,” Qin Yu said.

Fang Yue smiled and said, “I’ll give it to you.”

Qin Yu curled his lips and said, “I don’t want this. You can keep it for yourself.”

Fang Yue immediately covered her mouth and laughed.

“Mr. Qin, your actions are really shocking.” Fang Yue said seriously.

“Now, at least half of the Inner Strength Grandmasters in the Jiang Bei region have been killed by you.”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “They deserved to die.”

Serving the Yan family meant that they were destined to become Qin Yu’s enemies. Sooner or later, they had to be killed.

“Mr. Qin, what are your next plans?” Fang Yue asked.

Qin Yu looked at Fang Yue and said in a deep voice, “I do have a plan. Perhaps Miss Fang can help me.”

Hearing that, Fang Yue pretended to be terrified and said, “It’s my honor to be able to work for Mr. Qin.”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “Don’t play this game with me.”

After saying that, Qin Yu said seriously, “I plan to create my own alliance.”

“Your own alliance?” Fang Yue was slightly surprised.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, it’s absolutely impossible for me to challenge the Yan family by myself. After all, it’s modern society nowadays.”

Fang Yue said in a low voice, “That’s true. In modern society, it’s indeed difficult to achieve anything with just martial arts.”

Speaking up to this point, Fang Yue continued to ask, “I wonder from what angle you plan to start from?”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment before saying, “I’ve thought about it carefully. If I want to go against the Yan family and the Han family, I must think of three aspects.”

“Business, martial arts, and connections are all indispensable.”

“Since Old Mister Yan has the power to develop the business aspect, I plan to establish my own sect.”

“As for connections, I hope I can rely on Miss Fang.”

Fang Yue was silent for a moment.

Then, she smiled and said, “Mr. Qin is an Elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. Why do you need my help?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “It’s far from enough. I need connections in Jingdu.”

“If Miss Fang is unwilling, then just pretend that I didn’t say anything,” said Qin Yu.

Fang Yue thought for a moment and said, “Let me think about it.”

“Okay.” Qin Yu didn’t force her. After all, it was impossible to force something like this.

“Hottie, are you planning to cuckold your partner?”

At this moment, a young man walked over from the side.

The young man looked at the green hat in Fang Yue’s hand and said with a wicked smile, “Why don’t you consider me? What do you think?”

Fang Yue glanced at the young man and said with a nonchalant smile, “Do you think you’re worthy?”

The young man wasn’t angry.

He said proudly, “Hottie, it seems that you don’t know my identity.”

“Oh really? What’s your identity?” Fang Yue raised her eyebrows and asked.

The young man said proudly, “You know the Jiang Bei Martial Arts Association, right? My second uncle is Guan Jiarong, the president of the Jiang Bei Martial Arts Association!”

“In the entire Jiang Bei region, who doesn’t show my second uncle respect?” The young man said proudly.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com
