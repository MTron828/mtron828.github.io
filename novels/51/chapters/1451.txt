Chapter 1452: Chapter 1,452, The Mysterious Sect Master 1

Sister Lin’s residence was in Gu City.

In Qin Yu’s opinion, she had accumulated a lot of connections during the auction over the years. Even if she left the auction, she should be living a good life.

However, when Qin Yu arrived at Sister Lin’s house, she realized that it was different from what she had imagined.

Sister Lin’s house was in ruins. When Qin Yu arrived, there were three to five ruffians fighting over the treasure.

Sister Lin, on the other hand, had her eyes slightly closed. She didn’t have any reaction, as if she had already gotten used to it.

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu was instantly furious.

He waved his hand and directly beheaded these ruffians!

Then, Qin Yu’s palm lit up with spiritual fire, instantly burning their bodies clean.

Looking at sister Lin in front of him, a trace of surprise flashed across Qin Yu’s face.

“Qin Yu? Why are you here?”Sister Lin stood up and asked.

Qin Yu didn’t respond to her question. He glanced around and frowned, “Sister Lin, what’s going on?”

Sister Lin sighed slightly and said, “The news that I offended the heavenly cloud sect has already spread. No one dares to associate with me.”

“Then what do those people who came to steal things mean?”Qin Yu frowned and asked.

Sister Lin said with a wry smile, “Who wouldn’t want to step on you when you’re Down and Out?”

After that, sister Lin didn’t seem to want to continue this topic. She got up and found a clean place with great difficulty, motioning for Qin Yu to sit down.

Sitting beside sister Lin, Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Just because you were taken away by the Heavenly Cloud sect once, do they have to treat you like this?”

Sister Lin said with a wry smile, “This is nothing. In the South Province, as long as you offend the Tianyun sect, it’s easy to attract the displeasure of others. Fortunately, these people are only snatching some things.”

“Let’s not talk about this. Qin Yu, why did you suddenly come to Gu City? Aren’t you afraid of being left here?”Sister Lin changed the topic.

Qin Yu snorted coldly and said, “A mere gu city probably can’t stop me.”

With Qin Yu’s current state, he was already planning to go to the heavenly cloud sect, so how could he be afraid of a Gu city.

“I happened to pass by this place, so I thought of coming over to see you,”said Qin Yu.

Sister Lin Sized Up Qin Yu and said with some doubt, “You... recovered your spiritual power?”

Qin Yu agreed, “Yes, not long ago.”

“Nascent soul stage? That’s really surprising,”said sister Lin with a smile.

Then, sister Lin continued to ask, “What are your plans next?”

Qin Yu’s face darkened and said, “I want to go to the Tianyun sect. I have to kill the first elder first.”

“You want to go to the Tianyun Sect?”Sister Lin’s face changed. “Are you crazy? The Tianyun sect is looking for you. How can you deliver yourself to them?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I’m confident. I Don’t care about the first elder at all.”

“What about the sect leader of the Heavenly Cloud Sect?”Sister Lin asked with a sullen face.

“The sect leader of the Heavenly Cloud sect is in closed-door cultivation, not dead. What if he makes a move?”

Qin Yu instantly fell into silence.

This was the truth. The current Qin Yu was definitely not a match for the sect leader of the Heavenly Cloud Sect.

That sect leader’s strength was probably above Jue Wu’s.

“Sister Lin, do you know the sect leader of the Heavenly Cloud sect very well?”Qin Yu asked.

Sister Lin shook her head and said, “Not really. I’ve only heard some legends about him.”

“It’s said that this person’s temperament is extremely strange. Sometimes he’s violent, sometimes he’s gentle.”

“Back then, when he expanded his territory, he killed countless people. However, after he established the Heavenly Cloud sect, he didn’t make a move for many years.”

Sister Lin counted with her fingers and said, “I’m afraid he hasn’t made a move for more than a hundred years. His current strength is unimaginable.”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes. He knew very little about the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect. He only knew that he was an extremely powerful opponent.

Even the records of the sect master in the library were very few. This was not in accordance with common sense.

Under normal circumstances, he was equivalent to conquering a southern region. Although it was not as good as the ancient emperor, it was not much different. Shouldn’t he spend a lot of effort to write about himself?

“In short, it’s not a good idea for you to go to the Heavenly Cloud Sect.”Sister Lin shook her head.

Qin Yu also recalled the scene of the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect making a move. However, if he gave up just like that, Qin Yu would not be able to suppress the anger in his heart.

“Sister Lin, even if I can’t kill him, I still have a way to escape,”Qin Yu said.

With the line character formula in hand, he should be able to escape.

Seeing this, sister Lin could only sigh and say, “Qin Yu, you must never underestimate the Heavenly Cloud Sect.”

“Over the past hundred years, countless people have tried to shake the position of the Heavenly Cloud sect, but in the end, they all failed.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath.

There were countless experts in the South Province, and those above Qin Yu were even more common.

The legend of the three madmen and three unique skills that he knew was above him.

“Sister Lin, I got it.”Qin Yu stood up and said. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Sister Lin, let me bring you to a place?”Qin Yu swept his gaze around.

The surroundings were in chaos. This place was obviously no longer suitable for living.

Sister Lin said with a bitter smile, “Where Are you bringing me? You Don’t even have a fixed residence.”

Qin Yu said with a smile, “Of course I have to find a good place for you. Come with me.”

Qin Yu said nothing, took sister Lin’s hand and walked away.
