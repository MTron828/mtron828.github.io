Chapter 170: Qin Yu! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

These chariots quickly swarmed forward and surrounded the entire barbecue stall!

Then, they saw Mr. Guo get down from the chariots. He looked around coldly and shouted, “Surround them! Don’t let even a fly out!”

“Yes!”

Countless soldiers shouted and their voices were deafening!

The bald man’s expression turned ashen with fright. He gulped and muttered, “What’s going on? It shouldn’t have anything to do with me, right?”

At this moment, Xiao Yu ran toward Mr. Guo.

“Mr. Guo!” Xiao Yu ran to Mr. Guo in a few steps.

When he saw Xiao Yu, Mr. Guo’s expression immediately softened.

He smiled and said, “Xiao Yu, is everything okay?”

“It’s fine. Fortunately, you guys came early. Otherwise, I would have been brought to mine coal by them!” Xiao Yu wrinkled her nose and said with a snort.

The bald man’s expression suddenly turned ashen.

What was he afraid of?!

Mr. Guo waved his hand and shouted, “Arrest them all!”

“Yes!”

Many soldiers immediately took out their guns and pointed them at the bald man and the others!

The bald man was so scared that his whole body was trembling and cold sweat was pouring down his back.

He braced himself and said, “Sir... sir, what... What’s going on? Is there some sort of mistake?”

Before Mr. Guo could say anything, Xiao Yu glared at him and said, “You’re bullying ordinary civilians. How dare you ask if there’s some sort of mistake? Do you have any shame? Let me tell you, I’ll arrest all of you and shoot all of you today!”

The bald man’s body suddenly went limp and he fell to the ground.

“I had no idea who you are. Sorry if I’ve offended you. Please forgive me...” the bald man begged for mercy desperately.

Xiao Yu snorted lightly and said, “Now you know to apologize? Why didn’t you think about other people’s feelings when you bullied them?”

Mr. Guo said coldly, “No need to say anything. Take all of them away and hand them over to the relevant departments. If there’s no problem, I’ll naturally let you go. If it’s really like what Xiao Yu said, then everything will be dealt with according to the law!”

With that, a group of soldiers stuffed the bald man and the others into the car.

The people watching the scene were all in shock.

What the h*ll was going on?

The owner of the barbecue stall couldn’t help but swallow hard.

So this little girl wasn’t lying?

“Qin Yu.”

At this time, Mr. Guo saw Qin Yu a short distance away.

He walked in front of Qin Yu and said with a smile, “Xiao Yu is with you?”

Qin Yu spread his hands and said, “She insisted on treating me to a meal, so I had no choice but to come.”

“Bah, you insisted on coming with me!” Xiao Yu said with her eyes widened.

Mr. Guo was amused. He waved his hand and said, “Then I won’t disturb the two of you. But... Qin Yu, you have to take good care of Xiao Yu.”

“Don’t worry.” Qin Yu nodded helplessly.

After Mr. Guo left, Qin Yu was basically full.

He patted his belly and said, “Let’s go. I’ll send you home.”

“This early? I still want to go out and play,” Xiao Yu said reluctantly.

“It’s so late, but you don’t want to go home? Be careful of foul things!” Qin Yu deliberately scared her.

Xiao Yu was so scared that her face turned pale. She waved her hand and said, “No, no, I want to go home.”

Qin Yu didn’t waste any time. He immediately drove Xiao Yu home.

Before he left, Xiao Yu leaned on the car window and said, “I’ll introduce you to a few friends some other day. You can compete to see whose car can run faster!”

“I’m not interested.” Qin Yu rolled his eyes.

These people who played with cars were all rich playboys. Qin Yu wasn’t like them at all.

Moreover, Qin Yu didn’t have so much free time.

After driving home, Qin Yu sent a message to Wei Ming. He said that he would go to look for herbs tomorrow night.

But plans could always change.

The next morning, Wei Ming called Qin Yu back.

He said apologetically on the phone, “Mr. Qin, I’m sorry. My dad is going to take me to a banquet tonight, so I’m afraid we’ll have to delay things for a day.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Okay, you can go ahead. I’m not in a hurry.”

“Thank you,” Wei Ming agreed.

Qin Yu didn’t go out for the whole day.

All he could think about was cultivation.

“With my current strength, maybe I can try to set up a formation,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Just like the Water Dragon Cave, who knew how much spiritual energy a formation could gather?

Other than that, Qin Yu was also thinking about whether he should find a time to verify if he could rely on dark energy to cultivate.

Time flew by, and night soon fell.

In the evening, Qin Yu’s phone rang again.

He picked up the phone and saw that the caller was Mr. Wu.

Qin Yu picked up the phone and said, “Mr. Wu, what’s the matter?”

Mr. Wu smiled on the phone and said, “Do you have time? Come with me to a banquet tonight.”

“A banquet?” Qin Yu frowned. “What banquet?”

Mr. Wu smiled and said, “Don’t worry, it will definitely benefit you.”

Since he said so, Qin Yu didn’t say anything more and agreed.

After thinking about it, Qin Yu decided to bring Mr. Yang out to expand his network as well. After all, Mr. Yang was still the main factory owner.

Half an hour later, Mr. Wu sent a car to the entrance of the hotel.

After getting in the car, Qin Yu couldn’t help but ask, “Mr. Wu, what kind of banquet are we going to?”

Mr. Wu said mysteriously, “You’ll know when you get there. Anyway, all the important people in the provincial capital will be there. You’ve been in the limelight recently, and many people are curious about you.”

“As expected.” It was just as Qin Yu had guessed.

The car sped all the way and soon arrived at a hotel.

The entrance of the hotel was filled with luxury cars.

And this hotel was booked, so one needed an invitation letter to enter.

Qin Yu followed behind Mr. Wu and walked in. As soon as he entered, people around him walked up and greeted Mr. Wu.

Mr. Wu was helpless and could only say to Qin Yu, “Qin Yu, you can take a stroll first. I’ll come and look for you later.”

“Okay, you go ahead.” Qin Yu nodded.

Then, Qin Yu and Mr. Yang strolled around the venue.

It had to be said that the scale of this gathering was indeed very large. The people who came here were all dressed to the nines and had an elegant aura.

“Recently, that person called Qin Yu has been in the limelight. I heard that this kid is not only powerful but also possesses blue spirit fire!”

“Yeah, I also watched the video. Qin Yu’s talent is indeed outstanding!”

Just after strolling around for a moment, Qin Yu heard someone talking about him.

This surprised Qin Yu a little.

“I really didn’t expect that I would be so famous now.” Qin Yu rubbed his nose and muttered.

“What bullsh * t Qin Yu? He’s just a coward. I snatched his pill, but he didn’t even dare to do anything about it!”

At this moment, a disdainful voice entered Qin Yu’s ears.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com
