Le Xian immediately pretended to be terrified and said, “Guqiong, although we are very close, if you speak nonsense, I will still sue you for slander.”

“You!” Wan Guqiong immediately flew into a rage!

He glared at Le Xian and said coldly, “Uncle Le, aren’t you going overboard?”

“I’m protecting my guest. What’s so overboard about that?” Le Xian pretended to be innocent.

At this moment, Wan Guqiong also understood.

He couldn’t help but sneer. “Le Xian, what benefits did Qin Yu give you? Why are you protecting him?”

“What benefits? It’s just my duty,” Le Xian said with a faint smile.

Wan Guqiong didn’t say anything for a moment, but just looked at Le Xian coldly.

A moment later, Wan Guqiong took a deep breath and said, “Le Xian, no matter what benefits he promised you, you will definitely regret it!”

“Hehe, is that so? Then there’s no need for Young Master Wan to worry.” Le Xian said with a smile.

Wan Guqiong walked directly to Qin Yu and said coldly, “Qin Yu, you’re impressive. You actually made Le Xian betray me. I really underestimated you.”

Qin Yu said indifferently, “Do you think I can’t see through such a simple trick?”

“Alright.” Wan Guqiong nodded.

“Although I can’t kill you, I’ll tell you clearly that you won’t get anything from the exchange! If you don’t believe me, we’ll just wait and see!”

After saying that, he turned to look at the girl and said coldly, “Keep your herbs well and don’t exchange with him. Otherwise, I’ll expel you from the exchange!”

The girl didn’t dare to say anything and nodded carefully.

After Wan Guqiong left, Qin Yu looked at Le Xian and said, “Thank you, Mr. Le.”

Le Xian said expressionlessly, “There’s no need to thank me. Don’t forget what you promised me.”

After saying that, Le Xian turned around and left.

After he left, Yao Meng said in surprise, “What did you promise him? He would rather offend Wan Guqiong to help you?”

Qin Yu didn’t hide anything. He said in a low voice, “Le Xian isn’t a good person. He also covets Yan Ruoxue’s bloodline...”

“So you... ?” A trace of shock flashed across Yao Meng’s face.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I promised to give him a strand of Yan Ruoxue’s bloodline.”

“You... you really will give him a strand of Yan Ruoxue’s bloodline?” Yao Meng couldn’t help but swallow hars.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Of course it’s a lie. Anyone who covets Yan Ruoxue’s bloodline is my enemy. They all deserve to die!”

“Since they are my enemies, they derserve to get lied to!”

Yao Meng opened her mouth, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.

She never thought that Qin Yu wouldn’t only lie to the Wan Guqiong, but also lie to Le Xian!

“Miss Yao, please keep this matter a secret,” Qin Yu said.

Yao Meng nodded and said, “It’s necessary to keep it a secret, but... Wan Guqiong said that you won’t get anything from this exchange.”

“With his ability, I believe that he isn’t talking nonsense.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh and said, “I have no other choice. I can only take it one step at a time.”

At this moment, Yao Meng suddenly suggested, “How about this, you give me your things and I’ll help you exchange them?”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows. This was a good idea!

However, Qin Yu, who was suspicious by nature, was a little worried.

However, after thinking about it, Qin Yu had already told Yao Meng about lying to Le Xian. Why distrust her?

“Okay, then thank you, Miss Yao. If this matter is done, I will always remember your kindness,” Qin Yu bowed and said.

“You’re welcome. I’m doing this for Ruoxue,” Yao Meng said with a smile.

Qin Yu immediately handed over all his things to Yao Meng.

The current Qin Yu could only place his hopes on Yao Meng.

...

The next day.

Qin Yu came to the exchange meeting again. As usual, he put up the sign and waited for people to come to his stall.

Unfortunately, no one paid attention to Qin Yu’s stall for the whole morning.

At this time, Wan Guqiong walked over from not far away.

He sneered and said, “How about it? Does anyone want to trade with you?”

Qin Yu glanced at him and snorted coldly. “Don’t be complacent for too long. I’ll let you know the price of offending me.”

“Hahaha! You should understand the price of offending me now, right?” Wan Guqiong asked back.

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered with Wan Guqiong.

He put away his stall, turned around, and left.

Since no one came to exchange with him, there was no point for Qin Yu to stay here.

He turned around and walked out of the palace.

This was an abandoned Mystic Realm. In addition to this incomplete palace, there was also a large piece of desolate land.

When he stepped into the Mystic Realm, Qin Yu felt the strangeness of this Mystic Realm.

Not a single blade of grass grew in the entire Mystic Realm. That strange internal qi made people feel extremely uncomfortable.

And for Martial Marquises, there were very few reasons that could make them feel uncomfortable.

Because Martial Marquises cultivated in spiritual energy, what made them feel uncomfortable the most was dark energy, which was the opposite of spiritual energy.

Qin Yu scanned his surroundings and said in a low voice, “This scene of decline should be caused by dark energy.”

Even though that was the case, Qin Yu couldn’t internal qi a single trace of dark energy. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Qin Yu scanned his surroundings and sniffed to find the source of this strange internal qi.

Unfortunately, Qin Yu spent a while but still couldn’t find the source of that strange internal qi.

This internal qi seemed to come from all directions and had no source at all.

“Strange.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown slightly.

He rose into the air and looked down at the large Mystic Realm.

At the same time, Qin Yu closed his eyes and began to deduce the Heavenly Secrets!

Since the Heavenly Secrets could find places with rich spiritual energy, then it could naturally find dark energy!

As long as there was dark energy, the spiritual energy would be extremely weak, or even empty!

Therefore, as long as Qin Yu relied on the Heavenly Secrets to find places where the spiritual energy was scarce, it was very likely that he would find dark energy!

Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly and felt the Great Dao.

At this moment, the inner scenery appeared in front of Qin Yu again.

In the inner scenery, the threads of light were extremely dim.

This was one of the reasons why this place was declining.

Qin Yu was constantly looking for the Great Dao anomalies in the inner scenery.

Very soon, Qin Yu found the extra Great Dao anomalies.

These anomalies in the Great Dao all originated from the palace. It was probably because someone was carrying 10,000-year-old herbs.

“Huh?”

At this moment, Qin Yu saw a trace of inconspicuous gray darkness in the Great Dao.

This gray darkness was completely different from the light in the Great Dao!

Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes and found the location shown in the Great Dao.

“It should be there.” Qin Yu looked in a direction and said in a low voice.

He didn’t waste any time and immediately rushed toward the direction shown in the Great Dao.
