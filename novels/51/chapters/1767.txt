1768 Forced Adaptation

Qin Yu forced a smile and said, “Many thanks...”

“Xiao Hai asked me to pass on his thanks to you.” Xiao Sheng paused for a moment before continuing, “You saved his life, so I owe you one.”

Qin Yu waved his hand. He wanted to say something, but the intense pain almost made him collapse.

Cold sweat covered his entire body. His face was pale, and he looked utterly weak.

He opened his mouth and was about to say something, but his vision went black, and he fell straight down.

It was already three days later when he woke up again.

The intense pain did not disappear with his fainting. As Xiao Sheng had said, it would have to accompany him for a long time.

The bed was surrounded by people who already knew Qin Yu’s physical condition.

Looking at how difficult it was for Qin Yu, everyone was emotional.

The first thing Qin Yu did when he woke up was to get up again.

Like an older man staggering, his body was on the verge of collapse.

Seeing this scene, Jue Wu couldn’t help it.

She opened her arms and hugged him with her slender body. She said in a rare gentle voice, “Qin Yu, have a good rest, okay?”

While Qin Yu looked down at Jue Wu and forced a smile, “I... I’m all right. Mr. Xiao said that faith will overcome everything...”

“Why do you have to risk your life? If there’s anything that needs to be done, just leave it to us.” Wen Wanchong said in a deep voice. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Qin Yu looked at him and smiled. “There are some things... I have to do it myself.”

“It’s because of a certain aristocratic family in Zhongzhou.” At this moment, Xiao Sheng spoke.

“An aristocratic family from Zhongzhou?” Everyone in the room fell into silence.

It was Zhongzhou, the most powerful place in the entire Holy Region.

With their power, it would be difficult for them to shake any family in Zhongzhou.

“An aristocratic family in Zhongzhou, So what? Qin Yu, rest well and leave it to me!” Jue Wu angrily said.

“Just tell me their names. I’ll take care of them tomorrow!”

“Lord Jue Wu, please don’t brag...” Wen Wanchong laughed.

Jue Wu glared at him and retorted, “I can’t do it today, but that doesn’t mean I can’t do it tomorrow! If one day didn’t work, then ten days. If one year didn’t work, then ten years! One day, I’ll be able to bring them down!”

Hearing Jue Wu’s words, Qin Yu was extremely pleased.

“Thanks for your kindness, but I can do it,” he said with a smile.

After saying that, he propped himself up and walked around the room with difficulty.

“You see, I can walk now. I’ll be able to run in two days.” He tried to ease the atmosphere.

But the more he tried, the more uncomfortable everyone felt.

“Give me a few days to get used to it. If I can’t do it, I won’t force myself,” he added in a severe voice.

Jue Wu opened her mouth, wanting to say something, but was stopped by Xiao Sheng, who shook his head and said, “Give him a few days. Otherwise, he won’t give up.”

After hearing Xiao Sheng’s words, Jue Wu finally swallowed her words despite having thousands of words to say.

So, according to Qin Yu’s instructions, everyone went out.

In the next few days, he did not have the slightest intention of giving up but intended to get used to this pain and continue to walk with it.

Qu Zhu and the others were waiting outside the room, afraid that something would happen to Qin Yu.

In the blink of an eye, ten days had passed.

Qin Yu had also gotten used to the pain.

At first, he couldn’t get up, but now he could almost move freely.

However, it would probably be very difficult to walk like before.

He slowly tried to lead a normal life. He ate with the others, chatted with them, and walked around Dayue Mountain with them.

Even though his brows were furrowed from time to time, he did not stop.

“What terrifying adaptability!” Wen Wanchong couldn’t help sighing emotionally.

“You’re wrong. It’s the power of faith.” Qu Zhu also sighed with emotion.

“People like me will never understand this power. The purity and passion in their hearts is something I can never make up for.” He shook his head.

Although Wen Wanchong was confused, he nodded in agreement.

In the blink of an eye, another dozen days had passed.

Qin Yu’s activities had almost returned to normal. Of course, they were just ordinary activities without any cultivation.

On this day, Qin Yu, Qu Zhu, and Wen Wanchong sat together for a meal.

Qin Yu suddenly thought of Jue Wu. He looked at them in surprise and said, “It’s been a long time since I’ve seen Jue Wu. Where did she go?”

Wen Wanchong rolled his eyes and said, “Lord Jue Wu is a simple-minded person. After she heard about the aristocratic family in Zhongzhou, she went into a retreat. She seems to want to go to Zhongzhou badly.”

Hearing this, although Qin Yu felt a little helpless, he was more touched.

Jue Wu didn’t have so many thoughts. She was an extremely innocent person.

This kind of innocence was too rare in this world.

“Speaking of which, Jue Wu played a big role in the last battle,” Qu Zhu added.

“Exactly!” Wen Wanchong quickly nodded and said, “Although she has absorbed the Purple Cloud Pearl, she seems to be able to use a part of its power.”

“In the last battle, Yong Ji and Sima Bei were no match for her even when they joined forces. You have to know that she’s only at the half-step Reversion Void Stage.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. Of course, he knew that.

“I’m afraid it’s related to her special constitution,” he said.

“Besides the Purple Cloud Pearl, I don’t know if Jue Wu can absorb any other Dharma Treasures.”

Wen Wanchong nodded. “I’ve also thought about this question. If she absorbed all the treasures and turned them into her power, how crazy she would be!”

“Yup.” Qin Yu nodded in agreement.

He also had some expectations for Jue Wu’s potential.

Wen Da and Wen Er brought him around aimlessly in the following period.

Since the signal in North Plain was removed, Nanzhou had returned to its former prosperity.

Walking on the streets, one could hear the sounds of people hawking their wares everywhere, and all kinds of Dharma Treasures were being taken out.

Wen Da and Wen Er were not interested in this. They were only responsible for bringing Qin Yu to eat, drink, and have fun.

“Qin Yu, there’s a very fun place in Dayue City. Shall we go and try it?” Wen Da said mysteriously on this day.

“Yes, it’s so fun!” Wen er also nodded.

“What fun place?” Qin Yu asked suspiciously.

“Hey, don’t worry about it. You’ll know when you get there. I promise it’ll be fun!” Wen Da replied mysteriously.

So, Qin Yu followed the two brothers to the mysterious place with suspicion.

After walking through the streets for a long time, the two brothers finally stopped.

“This is it!” Wen Da pointed to a brothel in front of them.

Wen Er wiped the drool from the corner of his mouth and said with a perverted look, “I haven’t been here in a long time. I wonder if Xiaohong misses me.”
