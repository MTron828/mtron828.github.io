Wei Ming was slightly surprised and said, “Mr. Guan, do you know two each other?”

The young man sneered and said, “We know each other. Of course we know each other.”

“Mr. Qin and I are friends. It’s great that we can work together,” Wei Ming said excitedly.

However, the young man sneered and said, “Wei Ming, I originally wanted to give you a chance because I saw that your performance wasn’t bad.”

“But now that you’ve called this kid here, there’s no need to talk about our cooperation!”

Wei Ming’s expression instantly became a bit ugly.

“Mr. Guan, what’s going on? Is there some misunderstanding?” Wei Ming said with a bit of fear.

The young man sneered and said, “Misunderstanding? This kid hit me. What misunderstanding do you think there is?”

Wei Ming subconsciously looked at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu knocked on the table with his fingers and said indifferently, “It seems that you didn’t tell Guan Jiarong about this.”

“If I told my uncle, do you think you would be sitting here?” The young man said with a cold expression.

Wei Ming pulled the young man and said somewhat anxiously, “Mr. Guan, what’s going on? Please sit down first.”

The young man glanced at Wei Ming and said coldly, “No one dares to hit me, Guan Kai, in the Jiang Bei region! You want to cooperate, right? Fine, I’ll give you a chance.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

After saying that, Guan Kai pointed at Qin Yu and said, “Either you kneel down and apologize to me, or you send your girlfriend to my room tonight. Otherwise, no deal!”

Qin Yu said with a cold expression, “It seems that you haven’t been beaten enough.”

Wei Ming hurriedly stopped Qin Yu. Then, he looked at Guan Kai and said, “Mr. Guan, if you like women, I’ll arrange it for you, okay?”

“No, I want his girlfriend, or we can’t cooperate,” Guan Kai said indifferently.

Wei Ming’s expression was a little ugly.

Guan Kai was obviously deliberately making things difficult for him.

Just as Wei Ming was in a dilemma, Qin Yu reached out and patted his shoulder, indicating that there was no need for him to be anxious.

Then, Qin Yu looked at Guan Kai and said, “I’ll give you a chance. Ask Guan Jiarong to come and see me immediately.”

When Guan Kai heard this, he immediately flew into a rage and said, “My second uncle is the president of the Jiang Bei Martial Arts Association! Is he someone that you can meet as you wish?”

“You’re not going to call him, right?” Qin Yu nodded.

He stood up and kicked Guan Kai in the stomach.

The tremendous force sent Guan Kai flying.

His body slammed heavily into the wall, and traces of blood dripped from his mouth.

Before Guan Kai could stand up, a powerful force came crashing down on him!

Guan Kai instantly felt as if he had been struck by a heavy blow. It was as if two huge mountains were pressing down on his shoulders, and he couldn’t move at all.

“You dare to hit me? Fine, Wei Ming. Let me tell you, the Wei family is finished!” Guan Kai cursed.

“Tomorrow, I will blacklist your family’s company and let you go bankrupt!”

“You dare to threaten him?” Qin Yu raised his finger, and a crisp sound came from Guan Kai’s calf!

“Ah!!!” Guan Kai shouted in pain.

“Mr. Qin, this...” Wei Ming was a little flustered.

He had never thought that things would come to this point.

Qin Yu looked coldly at Guan Kai and said, “Your family members are really the same. What, does the Jiang Bei Martial Arts Association belong to your family?”

Guan Kai gritted his teeth and said, “Just you wait. I’ll tell my second uncle right now, and I’ll kill you!”

After saying that, Guan Kai hurriedly took out his cell phone and called Guan Jiarong.

After the call was connected, Guan Kai angrily said, “Uncle, someone beat me. Hurry up and call a few Inner Strength Grandmasters for me. I’m going to kill him!”

After hanging up the phone, Guan Kai pointed at Qin Yu and said, “You’re dead meat. Just you wait!”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Okay, I’ll wait.”

Wei Ming looked extremely flustered.

He was also a martial artist, so he naturally knew what it meant to be the president of the Jiang Bei Martial Arts Association.

That was the official organization of the martial arts world! It practically controlled all the martial artists in the Jiang Bei region! No one was willing to offend them!

“Mr. Qin, I’m sorry to have implicated you.” Wei Ming sighed.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Don’t worry, Guan Jiarong is nothing in my eyes.”

“Haha, keep bragging! Dog, when my uncle comes, you won’t even be able to cry!” Guan Kai cursed through gritted teeth.

Qin Yu ignored him.

Since he had nothing to do, he took out his phone and opened the Martial Arts Forum to scroll around.

At this moment, Qin Yu discovered that the potential rankings on the Martial Arts Forum had been updated!

This time, Qin Yu jumped from fifth place to second place!

And the first place was He Teng.

“Who is He Teng? He’s actually ranked above me?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

Could it be that He Teng also had the ability to fight against ten people by himself?

After that, Qin Yu continued to look down.

At this time, a new post suddenly appeared on the Martial Arts Forum.

The Yan family will openly recruit sages. All the major martial arts aristocratic families can participate.

When he saw this news, Qin Yu’s expression became a little ugly.

Qin Yu had already known that the Yan family wanted to unify the northern region’s martial arts world. He never expected that the Yan family would announce their ambitions now!

“Oh no, the Yan family is one step ahead.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

In terms of influence and appeal, Qin Yu couldn’t be compared to the Yan family, which had a large establishment and business, unless he borrowed the power of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

But if that was the case, wouldn’t he drag the Divine Alchemist Pavilion down with him?

Putting aside whether the Pavilion Master would agree or not, even Qin Yu himself might not be able to accept it.

“The Yan family really isn’t easy to deal with.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but narrow his eyes slightly.

At this moment, the door of the private room was opened again.

Following that, Qin Yu felt a strong internal qi spread out!

he saw three Inner Strength Grandmasters walking in from outside the door!

And behind them was the president of the Jiang Bei Martial Arts Association, Guan Jiarong!

“Who is so bold as to dare to hurt my family’s people?”

Before Qin Yu saw him, Qin Yu heard Guan Jiarong’s voice first!

Guan Jiarong’s leisurely and overbearing voice came from behind the three people.

The moment he saw Guan Jiarong, Guan Kai immediately became excited.

“Uncle, you’re finally here!” Guan Kai anxiously shouted.

He pointed in Qin Yu’s direction and said, “It’s that b*stard! Uncle, cripple him quickly! Then lock him up in the Martial Arts Association’s prison, just like you did to those b*stards before!”

Guan Jiarong’s eyes slowly looked in Qin Yu’s direction.

When he saw Qin Yu clearly, his expression suddenly changed!

“President Guan, this matter started because of me. It has nothing to do with Mr. Qin.” Wei Ming stood up and took the initiative to say.

“Hehe, Wei Ming, you can’t escape either! Just wait to be imprisoned!” Guan Kai said through gritted teeth.
