2319 The Bell of the Holy Region

Piao Ruoyun took a while to recover from her shock. Hearing Qin Yu’s words, she gathered the people from the Azure Firmament Sect.

After issuing the command, the remaining disciples of the Azure Firmament Sect cautiously approached the main hall.

Only 20 out of nearly 300 disciples of the Azure Firmament Sect were left. The rest had all died tragically.

“Go and bring the people around here. Don’t worry, I’ve killed the monster race here.”

Qin Yu said to the people who had just come over.

In less than half a day, nearly 3,000 people were brought over.

Nearly half were children, and the rest were cultivators with relatively low cultivation.

This continent was huge.

When Qin Yu came to this continent previously, the population was close to 50,000.

At this moment, not even one-tenth of it was left. One could imagine how disastrous this calamity was.

“These monsters seem particularly cruel to cultivators with high cultivation. Almost 90% of the True Saint cultivators on this continent have been killed.”

Piao Ruoyun looked at those people and seemed to have recalled the terrifying massacre that had occurred earlier.

“The monsters seemed to have used some special ancient methods on the True Saint Realm cultivators to obtain great power through sacrifice.

“The sect could resist with the help of formation in the beginning. However, these monsters became increasingly stronger, and their demonic qi seemed to be able to suppress us directly.”

Several elders discussed this among themselves animatedly.

“I’m afraid it’s a method unique to the monster race. It uses sacrifices to obtain the power of the spatial cultivators.”

Qin Yu analyzed the battle just now. The power that the old man of the monster race obtained in the end could actually suppress him.

This meant that the owner of this power could at least suppress Qin Yu in terms of the cultivation realm.

The current spatial rift might not be enough for him to pass through, so he needed to use this method to descend.

“Hmm?” Qin Yu seemed to have discovered traces of a strange internal qi in those children.

The flow of this internal qi was extremely subtle, and only Qin Yu’s divine sense spirit bead could detect a slight trace of it.

The desolate divine eye.

The Heavenly Eye was above the heads of those children.

Black lines with a thickness similar to fishing lines flowed out and extended into the spatial rift.

Those black lines were tremendously fine to Piao Ruoyun and others with high cultivation.

Despite the activation of the desolate divine eye, the lines could not be seen without looking carefully.

The ordinary people seemed to emit more powerful internal qi. Was this the reason the monster race deliberately let some of them go?

On the altar at the side, black energy as thick as a bucket swayed. This internal qi was relatively powerful.

With a movement of his body, Qin Yu’s body came to the sky above the Azure Ridge Continent.

Not only the bodies of the living people but also the dead. Their bodies were all emitting that internal qi.

In fact, many of the empty spaces were constantly emitting internal qi.

And the colors of these internal qis did mean something. They seemed to belong to different attributes.

In the end, coincidentally, they all entered the spatial rift and were transmitted to another space.

Qin Yu frowned and carefully sensed that internal qi, but he realized that this aura was not spiritual energy or divine sense.

He grabbed it with his palm, but the black internal qi passed through his palm and could not be grabbed.

He used his spiritual sense to attack these strange internal qis, but it was also in vain.

This energy was not divine sense, so using the Soul Torment Mind Technique was similarly ineffective.

With a thought, Qin Yu suddenly circulated the Traceless Immortal Scripture.

In an instant, Qin Yu’s body transformed into something like a black hole, and the tremendous nature’s spiritual energy surged toward him.”

He gradually accelerated the circulation of the Traceless Immortal Scripture. Qin Yu had never circulated it to this extent before.

At this moment, the terrifying suction force on Qin Yu’s body even distorted the space.

The black energy finally trembled when the Traceless Immortal Scripture nearly circulated to its limit.

It surged toward Qin Yu’s body.

Qin Yu hesitated for a while but did not absorb the energy into his body. Instead, he sent it into the Spirit Storage Bead.

This thing was completely different from the direction of the Great Dao he cultivated. He did not know the consequences if it entered his body, so he dared not try it.

“Alright, let’s go.”

Qin Yu took out the warship. This warship was a treasure of the Skeleton Gang’s gang leader. It had a tremendously vast space.

It was not a problem accommodating everyone, so he immediately set off for Solitary Cloud City.

Due to the large number of people, there was no way to use the teleportation formation.

Therefore, they could only travel to Solitary Cloud City by warship.

As they traveled, they discovered many members of the Evil Extermination Sect holding the tokens of Command of the Earth and quickly passing on information.

“Spatial rifts have appeared in the Crescent Moon Continent, Blue Horizon Continent, and Fire Unicorn Continent. There’s an invasion by an alien race.”

The members of the Evil Extermination Sect swiftly passing by had grave expressions on their faces.

“Is times of chaos coming?”

Qin Yu’s expression was somewhat solemn.

The people from the Azure Firmament Sect standing on the ship were even more gloomy.

In times of chaos, human lives are like grass.

“I hope it’s just a coincidence.” An elder seemed to be praying.

However, everyone understood it would not be a coincidence if the same thing happened several times consecutively.

…

In Zhongzhou of the Holy Region, a somber and heavy tolling of bells sounded, slowly resonating like beacon fires passing on.

In the end, it spread throughout the entire Holy Region. It was the most ancient message transmission. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

These giant bells were set up in countless large and small sects, and even ordinary families had them.

This bell also represented the gathering order issued by the most powerful nine great aristocratic families in the Holy Region.

Many cultivators came out of seclusion and headed toward Zhongzhou in an instant.

In the main hall of the Yan family, one of the nine great aristocratic families…

The family heads of the great nine aristocratic families were gathered in one hall, including almost all the other families and sects in Zhongzhou.

Among them were heaven’s favorite Teng Zixu, and many other powerful factions’ representatives.

The prince, restrained in Peach Blossom Island by the nine great aristocratic families, also showed up.

“Recently, I received news from purgatory that many spatial rifts have appeared in that galaxy.

“The demon race, monster race, ghost race, and other alien races have all embarked and slaughtered the humans.”

Yan Tianshi stood in the central position of the main hall and said.

The others looked solemn and listened carefully to Yan Tianming’s explanation.

“As everyone knows. There will be many upheavals in each Path of Heaven year. It’s the tide of the Path of Heaven, a confrontation between different races.”

“And this is the first time we see the three races be united. Currently, no powerhouses above the fifth-grade True Saint have descended purgatory. However, according to the information provided by the patriarch of the Yan family, it was only a matter of time before they descended.”

Someone asked with a frown after hearing this.

“Purgatory is a low-level galaxy. If we safeguard the key passageway, they can’t reach the Holy Region even if all the gods and demons descend, right?”

“That’s the case under normal circumstances, but we can’t let our guard down.”

“Let’s not talk about the demon race for now. The monster and ghost races have been roaming in the lowest level of galaxies for a long time. This time, they actually broke through the restrictions and attacked purgatory. Rightfully, this should not happen. We can’t rule out these two races have already discovered a way to break through the galaxy.”

Yan Tianshi slowly told the information he received.
