2215 Traceless Immortal Scripture

At this moment, Qin Yu could not be bothered to conserve his spiritual power. He directly used Shrinking Ground Into An Inch and disappeared from where he was.

In the Solitary Cloud City, Qin Yu only heaved a sigh of relief after stepping in.

His divine sense had already mostly recovered, and he could faintly feel a terrifying pressure.

A mighty realm cultivator seemed to lurk in the city. It felt as if he could kill you with a single move.

In the square of Solitary Cloud City, Qin Yu appeared before the middle-aged stall owner. The four inner cores he obtained from the black-striped tiger and the people from Chang Hu and Ta Shan’s teams almost made up the required number.

“There’s no problem with these six inner cores, but the strength of these few golden cores does not meet my requirements.”

The middle-aged stall owner pushed the golden cores of Wu Mei, Feng, and a few others toward him.

“But forget it. I didn’t expect Chang Hu and Ta Shan to die in your hands. These two teams had indeed killed many people of my demon race. I’ll take it as giving you a discount for the Thousand-Year Soul-Condensing Grass.”

The middle-aged stall owner stared at a few inner cores and burst into laughter.

“Demon race?”

Qin Yu said with some doubt. He felt the middle-aged man before him not have a trace of demonic qi at all. He did not expect him to be from the demon race.

“Humans and demon race will eventually fight. Humans and demons are different, and only when a race surrenders that the bloody battle will end. The same goes with the race in purgatory.”

The middle-aged demon race said indifferently.

Qin Yu did not respond to what the middle-aged man had said. He did not want to listen to these ambiguous things now.

In Solitary Cloud City, at the Moon Listening Pavilion.

At this moment, Qin Yu appeared in one of the rooms. This place was splendid and magnificent, and spiritual energy surged.

There were also many members of the demon race, and human girls were accompanying them.

Of course, the expenses were not cheap. Qin Yu spent a piece of spiritual essence to put up here.

“Brother Qin, do you need a girl to serve you? As long as you can name it, we have it. There are even demon race girls here, as long as you can afford it.”

A woman in red pushed the door open and entered. She had high cheekbones and was leaning against the wall as she stared at Qin Yu smiling.

“No money.”

Qin Yu said coldly.

“Hahaha, how can you not afford it if you can kill Chang Hu and Ta Shan? Moreover, Mr. Qin, you’d better enjoy it now. Otherwise, you might not be able to return the next time you leave the city.”

The woman said with a smile.

“What do you mean?” Qin Yu asked with a frown.

“The information provided by the Moon Listening Pavilion is indeed chargeable, but this one is free of charge.”

The woman licked her bright lips and smiled maliciously.

“That swordsman?”

Qin Yu frowned.

“That’s right. I didn’t expect you to come back this time. I didn’t expect him not to make a move. Perhaps he saw that your divine sense was severely injured and felt disdained to attack.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Ji Yue chuckled and said.

“This man was originally from the Holy Region, but a b*stard son of the Si family eyed on his sister and forced her to become his concubine. In a fit of anger, he rode a horse to the Si family and killed five elders of the Si family with a single sword strike. He also severely injured Si Liuhe.”

“So fierce?”

Even Qin Yu was a little dumbfounded. Si Liuhe was the second person to break through to the True Saint. His strength shocked many sects and aristocratic families. How could such a genius be defeated by Xi Menn?

“This kind of talent is rarely seen even in the nine great aristocratic families. That’s why the Si family controlled his sister and sent her to purgatory. He can handle them if the Si family has problems in this galaxy.”

Ji Yue stared at Qin Yu curiously.

“Moreover, I heard that the Holy Region intends to take out a treasure and issue a bounty on your head in purgatory.

“Actually, I’m very curious as to why the Holy Region would do such a thing to a person who has just entered the True Saint Realm and whose divine sense is damaged.”

“Wait for me, Ruoxue. I’ll be back soon.”

Qin Yu’s state of mind was completely calm without fluctuations when he heard this. Even if there was such a huge gap, he was catching up step by step.

So what if he became the enemy of the entire purgatory?

“I’m going to start cultivating now. You may go now.”

Qin Yu ordered her to leave.

“Are you going to refine the Spirit-Gathering Pill?”

Ji Yue asked with a smile.

Qin Yu frowned. It seemed the Moon Listening Pavilion knew that he had gone to buy herbs.

To be honest, Qin Yu did not like the feeling of being exposed all the time.

“I have a piece of information that suits you. Ten pieces of spiritual essence will definitely increase the effectiveness of your pill by several times.”

“Three spiritual essences.” Qin Yu frowned.

“Eight pieces of spiritual essence. Final price.”

“Deal.”

…

After a round of bargaining, the deal was done.

“In level six of purgatory, there’s a Ginseng about to become a demon. Even if you cut off one of its leaves, it’s sufficient to double the effect of your pill.”

Ji Yue took the eight pieces of spiritual essence and left with a smile.

“Level six of the Mystic Realm.”

Qin Yu had a headache. This time, he had already encountered a True Saint Demonic Beast at level four of the Mystic Realm.

If he went up further, would he encounter a Demonic Beast that had already comprehended the power of rules? It would be very troublesome if he did.

However, the temptation of Ginseng becoming a demon was indeed great, even if he only obtained a part of it.

It was the same as the daffodil leaf that Qin Yu had obtained.

If he could obtain it, the Spirit-Gathering Pill he refined from the two super herbs and other supplementary herbs might be able to heal Qin Yu’s divine sense injuries.

It was better to wait a little longer. Qin Yu suppressed the thought of refining the Spirit-Gathering Pill.

He sat cross-legged on the ground. With a flick of his divine sense, a large pile of demon cores and golden cores appeared on the ground.

These were the savings of Chang Hu’s and Ta Shan’s teams over the years. He did not hold back and wildly absorbed the spiritual energy of these inner cores.

One by one, the demon cores turned into dust in his hands, and an immense amount of demonic qi and spiritual energy entered his body.

The cultivation of an ordinary physique could only absorb spiritual energy. The absorption of the demon core had to be slow. It could only be absorbed after it was completely refined by spiritual energy. However, it did not need to be so complicated for Qin Yu. He only needed to induce the demonic qi directly into his body.

In fact, the explosive demonic qi seemed to be more effective than spiritual power in tempering his body.

The advantages of a chaotic body’s cultivation were displayed to the extreme.

Qin Yu’s strength was steadily advancing toward the third-grade True Saint.

It was still too slow.

The Traceless Immortal Scripture.

At this moment, Qin Yu circulated the Traceless Immortal Scripture.

After he reached the True Saint Realm, his understanding of the Traceless Immortal Scripture improved. He seemed to have turned into a mass of chaos mixed with the various vital qi in heaven and earth.

Chaos was the beginning.

Qin Yu seemed to have comprehended something. His hands made a strange posture of hugging a baby.

He seemed to embrace the spiritual energy, demonic qi, murderous aura, and ghostly energy in the air.

For a moment, all kinds of vital qi rushed into Qin Yu’s body like a baby rush into its mother’s arms.
