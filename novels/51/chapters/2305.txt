2306 The Ninth Level of Purgatory

Xi Menn took it and put it into his mouth without saying anything.

After adjusting their conditions, the two entered the ninth level of purgatory together.

As soon as they entered, they heard a burst of strange laughter.

That voice seemed to have sounded in their souls. Even Qin Yu’s divine sense at this moment felt a little shaken.

Fortunately, it only lasted for a while before the laughter stopped.

The space was incomparably vast, and demonic qi overflowed.

Qin Yu’s divine sense probed in, but an invisible barrier seemed to have blocked it. He could not see the scene inside the mist of the demonic qi.

A feeling of extreme suppression was transmitted to Qin Yu’s heart as if an eye was watching him from the sky.

He circulated his chaotic qi, only to discover that his strength had been suppressed by half.

Looking at Xi Menn’s expression, he seemed to resist the power of heaven and earth with all his might.

“This is the might of an emperor, a suppression that comes from the soul. We’ll just move around at the edge. We’re no match for the things inside.”

Xi Menn said softly.

The two of them slowly walked forward, not daring to let out a trace of internal qi.

In front of them, a massive shadow suddenly appeared, causing shock to Qin Yu.

Upon closer inspection, it was actually a gigantic dragon corpse.

A massive hole hundreds of feet wide appeared in the belly of the huge Divine Dragon. Its huge eyeball was dug out, and almost none of the hard scales on its body were complete.

Qin Yu gasped. It was an ancient divine beast.

What kind of battle had it gone through to be in such a miserable state?

“Tap!”

A green light suddenly appeared in the gigantic dragon’s empty eyes.

It then suddenly swung its tail and lashed toward Qin Yu’s head.

The massive qi energy almost made Qin Yu unable to breathe. Suo Lin’s shield blocked in front of him.

In an instant, Qin Yu’s entire body was sent flying. The dragon corpse’s tail turned into countless pieces of meat that fell to the ground.

Qin Yu retreated several thousand meters in the air before coming to a stop, with its body surging with turbulent energy and blood.

“What a powerful body. I would have died if it were me.”

For once, Xi Menn gave a rare compliment.

“Why did this thing still move after it died?”

Qin Yu felt a chill down his spine. This was merely the outer perimeter of the ninth level, and such a terrifying thing had already appeared.

If it weren’t for the fact that this dragon’s corpse had endured some long years, and its scales had long shattered, this blow probably would not have been so tolerable.

He dared not imagine what kind of existence was in the center.

“I don’t know.” Xi Menn shook his head.

“Qin Yu, all of them have more or less absorbed the Monster Emperor’s internal qi. You can’t tell what kind of mutation it will be. You must be careful.”

Elder Guai’s nervous voice came from the Sumeru ring.

“Tap, tap, tap, tap!”

In front of them, a sudden sound of orderly footsteps sounded.

Five decaying earth dragons that walked with a leisurely pace emerged from the mist.

On top of them were five skeletons that had long turned into bones.

“Kill them!”

They raised their spears high and stabbed at the two of them.

As if sensing their internal qi, the earth dragons charged over in an instant.

A blood-sea-like killing intent instantly enveloped Qin Yu. In an instant, Qin Yu’s soul seemed to have seen countless scenes of slaughter. Blood and flesh flew everywhere, and human lives were like weeds.

Various kinds of cruel and dark scenes filled Qin Yu’s mind in an instant, causing his expression to become pale.

The Heavenly Sword!

The Heavenly Sword used the qi of heaven and earth as its blade.

Xi Menn swung his sword. The simple sword aurora instantly compressed the surrounding qi of heaven and earth into the sword energy.

The moment the Heavenly Sword pierced through the air, one could feel the suffocating sharpness of its edge.

The sword energy broke the spears directly, almost at the same time.

The five grabbed the sword aurora with their hands, and the massive sword energy pushed them a thousand meters away.

The sword energy slowly dissipated, and the five cavalrymen turned into dust gradually.

Xi Menn’s face was ashen. He had used almost all his strength in each strike without holding back.

“I need a few minutes to recover.”

He said and sat down cross-legged.

What kind of battlefield was this? Xi Menn could only kill five cavalrymen with a sword strike with all his might. How intense was this battlefield back then?

Qin Yu could not conceal the shock in his heart.

Suddenly, Qin Yu felt a tremendously cold chill.

Qin Yu turned around and saw an elderly man’s soul staring at him silently.

The scarlet lightning around the soul made Qin Yu tremble with fear.

How long had this d*mned soul survived? How could he still have such a powerful soul power?

“Hello, hello!”

Qin Yu greeted politely.

A strange smile slowly appeared on the elderly man’s face.

In the next moment, Qin Yu’s soul involuntarily submerged into his soul.

Qin Yu could only “see” himself standing among countless massive poisonous insects, snakes, and ants. These things were frantically devouring his divine sense.

Just as he was about to struggle, countless vines suddenly appeared and bound him.

A terrifying suction force suddenly appeared from the vine. Qin Yu’s soul power submerged into the vine bit by bit.

In the world of soul, a beast-like and yet not a beast face appeared in the air.

The giant face rolled and transformed into Yan Ruoxue’s sorrowfully beautiful face.

“Ruoxue!”

Qin Yu’s heart twitched.

The Sea of Soul that filled the sky gushed into his nose and mouth, making his soul almost incapable of thinking.

At this moment, his soul seemed to have frozen. Wisps of golden soul power were continuously extracted and entered the world of the soul in the outside world.

A warm and soft embrace gently hugged Qin Yu, and a familiar voice softly sounded.

“Have a good sleep, Qin Yu. I’ll bring you back to the Holy Region.”

At this moment, a woman in white was sitting on the ground ten thousand meters away from Qin Yu. Qin Yu would definitely be shocked if he saw her appearance. She looked exactly like Yan Ruoxue.

Waves of golden light entered her body from the void, making her body brighter and whiter.

In his divine sense, the other black Qin Yu suddenly opened its eyes as if sensing the danger.

A burst of sharp divine sense fluctuations suddenly shook out, allowing Qin Yu to recover a trace of consciousness.

“Soul Torment Mind Technique!”

Qin Yu’s soul suddenly emitted a terrifying suction force. The vines on his body slowly pulled him into the divine sense figurine.

It turned into pure soul power and then entered his soul.

The circulation of the Soul Soul Torment Mind Technique became increasingly faster. The vines, poisonous insects, snakes, and ants, Qin Yu absorbed them all into his soul.

In the end, the entire world of soul was pulled into Qin Yu’s soul.

It transformed into a terrifyingly pure soul and became a part of him.

Qin Yu burped comfortably. The strength of this soul was the strongest he had ever seen.

At this moment, he felt that after he had absorbed this vast amount of soul power, his soul became a little sore.

Suddenly, Qin Yu discovered a strange red lantern in this world. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Even though he had absorbed the entire world, the red lantern still did not disappear.
