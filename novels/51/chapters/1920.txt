1921 The Change in Uncle Yan’s Attitude

Qin Yu looked at Yan Ruoxue, waiting for her to continue.

“The news about the chaotic body and the Yan family’s bloodline was passed down tens of thousands of years ago. The companion of the Yan family’s first-generation Immortal Emperor also had a chaotic body,” Yan Ruoxue continued.

Qin Yu listened very carefully and did not dare to say a word.

Yan Ruoxue looked at Qin Yu and said with a smile, “Not long after, they gave birth to a son named Yan Tianming, known as Immortal Emperor Tianming. Being born in the Yan family’s most glorious era, Immortal Emperor Tianming was also one of the most powerful Immortal Emperors in history who once killed eight Immortal Emperors and severely injured three Immortal Emperors by himself.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but be shocked.

This legend had actually been around for so long.

“There are many legends about the Holy Region, and many geniuses were born there. However, even many more things seem to have been buried,” Yan Ruoxue said slowly.

“More things?” Qin Yu was confused.

Yan Ruoxue nodded and continued, “The Yan family’s ancient records say that the Holy Region is only a small part of heaven and earth, and the world we live in is the same.”

Qin Yu didn’t dare to say anything and waited for her to continue.

“Rumor has it that many unknown creatures appeared in the Holy Region many years ago. They were neither human cultivators nor Demonic Beasts, but their strength was beyond imagination. Even the Immortal Emperors couldn’t do anything to them.” Yan Ruoxue explained the contents recorded in the Yan family’s ancient book.

“It was during that battle that Immortal Emperor Tianming became the most famous person in the history of the Holy Region when he single-handedly quelled the turmoil in the Holy Region. It was also due to him that the Yan family became the top nine families in the Holy Region. Before he appeared, there were only eight great families in the Holy Region,” Yan Ruoxue said with a smile.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but be shocked.

The Immortal Emperor was the end of cultivation. At that level, all techniques were not worth mentioning. It was because they could simply cast dao techniques with a raise of their hands. Therefore, there was no such thing as who was stronger or weaker.

However, Immortal Emperor Tianming actually killed eight Immortal Emperors and severely injured three. What a brilliant achievement was this! It was not overstating to say that it was unprecedented!

“I’m now regarded as the complete bloodline inheritor of the Yan family. They are all looking forward to the appearance of existence like Immortal Emperor Tianming,” Yan Ruoxue said with a smile.

Qin Yu scratched his head and said with confusion, “In that case… Doesn’t it mean only the child between you and me is the most powerful existence?”

“No, I’m just saying the power of Immortal Emperor Tianming shocked everyone. It doesn’t mean the first-generation Immortal Emperor of the Yan family isn’t powerful.” Yan Ruoxue shook her head.

“In other words, it’s just that Immortal Emperor Tianming was too brilliant that the other Immortal Emperors are not worth paying attention to. The first-generation Immortal Emperor has also suppressed the previous generation.”

Qin Yu was rather shocked. The scene he saw in the Forbidden Zone flashed across his mind.

The scene resembled hell, and the so-called Forbidden Zone was like a passage to another world.

The strange creatures Yan Ruoxue mentioned must have come to the Holy Region through the passages.

“It’s sad to be in the same era as Immortal Emperor Tianming,” Qin Yu said with emotion.

“That’s right. In that era, all those who fought against Immortal Emperor Tianming died in his hands,” Yan Ruoxue said.

At this point, Yan Ruoxue changed the topic and said, “Do you know why I’m telling you this?”

Qin Yu shook his head, indicating he had no idea.

Yan Ruoxue’s eyes were as clear as water. She looked at Qin Yu and said, “I want to give you my bloodline. Right here, right now.”

Hearing Yan Ruoxue’s words, Qin Yu was stunned and blushed the next second.

It meant Yan Ruoxue was planning to give her body to Qin Yu. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Qin Yu was silent for a long time. He then shook his head and said, “No, I don’t want to rely on the power of bloodline to increase my strength forcefully. I also don’t want to be behind everyone’s back like this. I want to openly merge with your bloodline. So it definitely can’t be now.

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, Yan Ruoxue laughed.

She touched Qin Yu’s head and said, “Silly you! As long as you take my body, the Yan family cannot hurt you again, and Si Shiyue will also have to let you go.”

“I don’t need it. I don’t want to rely on your protection anymore.” Qin Yu grinned.

“I promised you before, so I will definitely use my own strength to prove it to you.”

Looking at Qin Yu’s bright smile, Yan Ruoxue was stunned for a moment.

At this moment, a person barged in.

This person was none other than Uncle Yan.

Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue were a little nervous when they saw Uncle Yan.

“Uncle Yan, you… When did you get here?” Yan Ruoxue furrowed her brows and had a bad feeling.

“I’ve just arrived,” said Uncle Yan slowly.

“Then what did you hear?” Yan Ruoxue quickly asked.

“I heard everything,” said Uncle Yan, his face expressionless.

Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue looked at each other, their eyes filled with unease.

At this moment, Yan Ruoxue’s voice rang in Qin Yu’s mind, “I’ll find a chance later, and you quickly run away! He will definitely kill you and not leave the Destiny Reincarnation Technique on you!”

Qin Yu glanced at Yan Ruoxue, feeling even more worried.

If he ran away, what situation would Yan Ruoxue face?

Just as the two were worried, a smile appeared on Uncle Yan’s face.

He stroked his chin and said slowly, “Qin Yu, I’ve underestimated you. You’ve got a backbone.”

“What do you mean?” Qin Yu asked in surprise.

“I heard your conversation just now. To be honest, if you dare to take Miss Yan’s body, I will kill you. Fortunately, you made the right choice,” Uncle Yan said with a faint smile.

Qin Yu was nervous and subconsciously looked at Yan Ruoxue.

Yan Ruoxue probed, “Did you hear anything else?”

“Eh? What else?” Uncle Yan’s face flashed with a hint of confusion.

Yan Ruoxue was relieved to note that Uncle Yan did not know about Qin Yu having learned the Destiny Reincarnation Technique.

...

“No, nothing, Uncle Yan,” she said with a smile. “You can take Qin Yu to the outer hall tomorrow.”

“Alright,” Uncle Yan agreed and said.

After the incident, Uncle Yan’s eyes were no longer as fierce as before when looking at Qin Yu, but had a hint of gentleness.

However, Qin Yu had no intention of going to the outer hall at all. The reason why he came to the Yan family was for Yan Ruoxue. If they could not stay together, it would be meaningless to stay in the Yan family. On the contrary, it would only bring trouble to Yan Ruoxue.

The following day.

Uncle Yan left Mount Donghuang with Qin Yu. He planned to go to the outer hall and let Qin Yu be a disciple in name.

However, as soon as they left Mount Donghuang, Qin Yu stopped in his track.

He cupped his hands to Uncle Yan and said, “Uncle Yan, please send me out of the Yan family.”
