2280 Interrupted Comprehension

“I won’t attack. The woman of nine lifetimes should have already perished. That woman is just a vessel.”

Uncle Ling looked at the evil exterminator. Seeing the evil exterminator not express anything, he silently retreated by the side.

“Ah!”

Seeing no one supporting him, Gu Ming suddenly threw out the bracelet he was wearing on his hand.

The bracelet immediately turned a dozen massive skulls, and each had a miserable energy of dead bodies which slowly emitted from the skulls’ eye sockets.

He suddenly clapped his hands, and the skulls exploded.

The dense energy of dead bodies caused a tremendous chain reaction, and a series of explosions exploded around Qin Yu.

Almost instantly, a white light flashed.

The sword light instantly shattered the terrifying shockwave from the explosion of the energy of dead bodies, but it did not affect Qin Yu at all.

Xi Menn stood up and looked at Gu Ming coldly.

“I still have a battle with him. You’ll die if you attack again!”

The indifferent voice sent a sudden chill down Gu Ming’s spine.

“Boom!”

Suddenly, the power of Path of Heaven descended, blasting onto Qin Yu’s body.

Situ Haoyue smiled coldly and suddenly attacked.

“D*mn it!”

Qin Yu was instantly crushed by the terrifying power of the Path of Heaven, breaking his state.

He withdrew his desolate divine eye and instantly saw Gu Ming and Situ Haoyue that had attacked him.

“My friend, I’m sorry. If you hadn’t taken away the woman of nine lifetimes, I would have protected you from comprehending the Path of Heaven. However, you’ve done something against humanity which is threatening to our human race. Please forgive me for interrupting your comprehension.”

Situ Haoyue placed his hands behind his back, portraying an air of moral superiority.

“Of course, if you hand over the masked woman now, I promise I won’t disturb your cultivation anymore.”

“F*ck you! You old b*stard.”

He did not expect to be interrupted by this b*stard at this moment.

He stomped his feet, and nine giant fire dragons suddenly appeared and surrounded Situ Haoyue in an instant.

After that, Qin Yu’s body arrived.

Under the cosmic form, an enormous fist passed through the nine fire dragons and appeared before Situ Haoyue.

The Fist of Annihilation with black flames punched out and landed on Situ Haoyue’s body.

“Your strength is not bad, but you’re too slow.”

Situ Haoyue revealed a mocking smile.

“Roar!”

The unicorn phantom rushed out from Suo Lin’s boxing glove and bit Situ Haoyue’s divine sense with a soul-hunting sound. His body instantly froze.

The massive force sent Situ Haoyue flying instantly, and blood dripped from his fist.

He severely injured Situ Haoyue with a punch!

Qin Yu’s body floated up, and Suo Lin’s boxing gloves emitted a bright red light.

Amid the blazing flames, lava dripped onto the ground one drop after another, and white smoke rose from the ground instantly.

“D*mn it! You piece of crap!”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth so hard that they were almost grinding to bits. He attacked with his utmost effort, without the slightest reservation.

“My friend! My friend! Let’s talk it over! Interrupting your cultivation was also the opinion of everyone. The masked woman had killed so many human cultivators. Everyone was afraid that she would make a comeback!”

Situ Haoyue’s face was ashen. He had never fought with Qin Yu before and did not expect Qin Yu to be so terrifying.

Initially, he thought that a fourth-stage True Saint cultivator could not be so overpowered no matter what. He did not expect himself to fail to withstand even one exchange.

“Shut up, you piece of crap!” Qin Yu was tremendously furious.

The Fire Fist!

Dozens of fiery fists landed on Situ Haoyue’s body, and the tremendously high temperature directly shattered his protective spiritual energy.

The smell of roasted meat filled the air. He was sent flying again and crashed fiercely onto the wall.

That was the entrance used for teleporting down from the seventh level. With a move of the body, Qin Yu quickly shuttled out.

In this void, danger could appear every second, so leaving as soon as possible was the most important thing.

Everyone reappeared on the seventh level of purgatory. Human corpses were lying around in the surroundings.

The intense smell of blood permeated the entire space. Some cultivators were sitting miserably on the ground, and their friends’ corpses were lying around them.

In half a month, this place had become a true purgatory.

In the sky, numerous flying demonic beasts circled in the air. There were also many demonic beasts on the ground devouring the corpses of human cultivators.

This place had become a paradise for demonic beasts instead.

Qin Yu frowned. He was a little puzzled. Why did the Ghost Mansion Mystic Realm have the slightest effect on demonic beasts?

Was there an agreement between the netherworld and the demon beasts?

“Forget it. I can’t be bothered anymore. I’ll go back to Solitary Cloud City and go for a retreat for some time.”

Qin Yu shook his head and retracted his thoughts.

No matter what, he had an enormous gain this time. He was only slightly away from mastering the Primordial Way.

Moreover, he had also kept the coffin of the woman of nine lifetimes in his Sumeru ring. It should be a supreme treasure.

Most importantly, he also saved Xiao Yu.

“Situ Haoyue, Gu Ming, it’s time to settle the matter just now.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Of course, there was still one most important thing to do. He looked at the two indifferently.

Instantly, the two of them trembled violently. Oh no, why was this kid so vengeful?

“Forget it, Qin Yu. Now that the fate of the humans on this continent has declined and humans have suffered such a catastrophe, they would still be a significant combat power for humans.”

Uncle Ling frowned and said.

“When they interrupted me, why didn’t they think that I was also a combat power for humans?”

Qin Yu laughed coldly.

“D*mn it! You hid the masked woman and still dared to be so outrageous. Everyone, look! He’s hiding the person who killed so many of our human cultivators. If that masked woman resurrects, it will be another catastrophe for the human race!”

Gu Ming shouted.

Instantly, the expressions of the surrounding people changed, and the gazes they looked at Qin Yu became unfriendly.

“This old thing isn’t easy to deal with, and he has incited so many cultivators.”

Qin Yu cursed silently. The chaotic qi in his body was also close to depletion. He would probably not have an advantage either if he continued fighting.

“Moreover, the coffin of the woman of nine lifetimes is with him. This coffin is the place where the woman of nine lifetimes cultivates. It must have contained the internal qi of the Great Dao of the nine lifetimes. It’s the exchange of the lives of all the human cultivators in the entire purgatory. Why do you get to own it by yourself?”

Situ Haoyue’s voice transmitted loudly, inciting the surrounding cultivators.

When the surrounding cultivators heard about the Great Dao of heaven and earth, their breathing quickened.

The robe he previously had obtained from Wu Ji also contained his Great Dao, which had caused a massive fight over it.
