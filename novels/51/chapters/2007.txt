2008 Change in Jue Wu

This battle shocked everyone, and it also fully revealed the determination of the mysterious demon race!

He was definitely not doing this to so-called promote himself but to attack the nine great aristocratic families!

Yan Yunfan’s status was extraordinary. He was once the Holy Son of the Yan family and the most valued heir of the Yan family.

Even though Yan Ruoxue has replaced his status, the entire Holy Region knew Yan Yunfan still maintained his extraordinary status. He was not weaker than Yan Ruoxue!

Qin Yu walked out of the inn. Almost the people in the entire street were discussing this matter.

Even though Five Mountain City was very small, the people were discussing this matter. It was evident how terrifying the influence of this matter was!

Qin Yu found a tavern and stopped for a while. He asked for some wine and listened to the discussions of the people around him while drinking.

“Rumor has it that Yan Yunfan met that mysterious person not long after he left the Yan family!”

“Yes, yes, I heard about it too! Rumor has it that they met in a Mystic Realm the Yan family had just developed!”

“He dared to attack him at the Yan family’s place. How terrifying!”

“I heard the battle lasted for three full days. In the end, the elders of the Yan family came out and scared off that mysterious person!”

“How terrifying! He actually escaped from the territory of the Yan family!”

Hearing everyone’s discussion, Qin Yu could not help but interrupt, “What was the outcome of the battle?”

“Yan Yunfan’s blood spilled all over the sky. Although there was no winner, he was clearly on the losing side!”

“That mysterious person relied on his tremendously fast speed to escape from the Yan family with a flap of his wings. How terrifying!”

“Is that pair of wings a secret treasure, or was he born with it?” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Hearing their discussions, Qin Yu became even more interested in this mysterious person.

Demon race? Azure Rock Forest? Could it be that he came from the depths of Azure Rock Forest?

The depths of Azure Rock Forest had always been a secret. Almost everyone who walked in died inside.

Even if they were lucky enough to escape, they would not talk about what they had seen and heard in Azure Rock Forest. Thus it became even more mysterious.

It was said that back then, great cultivators at the Tribulation Stage visited the place but received no response. Only a handful of the Immortal Emperors forcefully entered.

However, the Immortal Emperors were too legendary. They also did not leave behind any reference documents.

“Speaking of which, this mysterious person has temporarily relieved my pressure,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

The actions of the mysterious person were getting more rampant. Thus the nine great aristocratic families could not divert much attention to dealing with Qin Yu.

After all, Qin Yu’s threat was very minimal. There was only a slight uncertainty.

“Everyone, that mysterious person has appeared repeatedly. Did he not leave behind any facial features?” Qin Yu asked, feeling puzzled.

“No. Rumor has it that this mysterious person covered his face with a secret technique. We only know he has a pair of slender arms and is very tall and thin. He doesn’t look like a human,” someone answered.

Qin Yu rubbed his chin.

This description was somewhat similar to Xiao Sheng, but he didn’t have wings.

Moreover, Xiao Sheng would never do such a thing. He was a lord full of pride. He would never hide his face even if he wanted to do it.

Qin Yu stood up and left the tavern. On his way, he bought some food for Jue Wu and then hurried back to the inn.

After he served the wine and meat, Jue Wu wolfed down the food as if she hadn’t eaten for days.

“I’m going out in a few days. Wait for me here,” Qin Yu said while she was eating.

Hearing this, Jue Wu immediately stopped what she was doing.

She raised her head and said cautiously, “You’re not taking this opportunity to leave me behind, are you?”

Qin Yu could not help but laugh. He shook his head and said, “Of course not. What are you thinking?”

Jue Wu looked at Qin Yu and said word by word, “If you abandon me, I will never forgive you.”

Qin Yu was stunned and instantly froze on the spot.

For some reason, Qin Yu could not help but feel his heart aching when he heard this.

“Don’t worry. I won’t abandon you no matter what,” Qin Yu said as he stood up.

With Qin Yu’s guarantee, Jue Wu immediately relaxed and continued eating.

After eating and drinking to her heart’s content, Jue Wu took out the demonic egg and began studying it carefully.

During this period, there was still no reaction from the demonic egg. What surprised Qin Yu was the matter of the demonic egg actually did not cause any commotion. No one even came to fight for it.

“Is this demonic egg just an ordinary stone?” Qin Yu asked, feeling puzzled.

If it was a treasure, why didn’t anyone fight for it?

Even if the nine great aristocratic families did not make a move, those mysterious sects wouldn’t have sat still long ago!

The Holy Region was huge, and only the heavens knew how many mysterious sects were hiding in the dark, waiting for an opportunity to strike. No one knew how powerful their hidden strength was.

For instance, the Satan that Qin Yu knew was not an aristocratic family on the surface, but it possessed incredibly mysterious and terrifying secret techniques. Some tremendously powerful experts were most probably guarding it.

“Forget it. I can’t be bothered,” Qin Yu muttered.

Looking at Jue Wu’s serious expression, Qin Yu didn’t want to say anything.

After thinking about it, Qin Yu decided to leave the following day and accompany Jue Wu for another night.

That night, Jue Wu held the demonic egg in her arms. She looked at the starry sky outside and couldn’t help but sigh and say, “I wonder how Wen Er is doing now.”

At the mention of Wen Er, Qin Yu felt a little uncomfortable.

However, he was just a small character. No one would do anything to him.

...

“Wen Da’s revenge… I will avenge,” Qin Yu said.

At this moment, Jue Wu suddenly turned to look at Qin Yu. She smiled and said, “On the day of the meeting, I was actually planning to take the opportunity to attack Elder Si and avenge Wen Da.”

Qin Yu was startled. He suddenly recalled the abnormality of Jue Wu at that time.

During those few days, the usually lively Jue Wu became silent.

Qin Yu felt a little strange at that time. However, he didn’t think much about it. He didn’t expect Jue Wu to have such thoughts.

“I have a Saint Weapon. If I suddenly attack, I’m confident I can kill him.” Jue Wu’s tone was cold.

Qin Yu opened his mouth and asked, “Why did you change your mind then?”

“The plan couldn’t keep up with the changes. I only realized that day that they probably wouldn’t let you leave Sky City,” Jue Wu sighed and said.

“Therefore… you shifted your focus on the third princess so that I can escape?” Qin Yu frowned even more.

Jue Wu said proudly, “How about that? Am I smart?”

Qin Yu was instantly speechless, and he felt even more upset.

...

Jue Wu wasn’t a very considerate person. She was insensitive and had a carefree personality. But now, she could think so thoroughly for Qin Yu, even giving up her own plan.

It made Qin Yu feel more than just gratitude.
