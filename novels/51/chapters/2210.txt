2211 Hunting Demonic Beast

“We’ll set off from here tomorrow then. Don’t worry, Little Brother. With our strength, we can easily deal with the fourth level of purgatory.”

Chang Hu turned around and left with his team when he saw Qin Yu nod.

The following day, the group quietly left the city.

“Take this with you, Little Brother.”

Wu Mei handed him a green hat with a smirk.

“Is this used to conceal one’s internal qi?”

Qin Yu frowned. He was really dissatisfied with the color.

“Haha, just make do with it. In this disordered land, one must be cautious to preserve their life. Most people would hide their internal qi so that no one would dare to attack.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Chang Hu laughed heartily.

Qin Yu nodded. This way, if people with ill intentions wanted to make a move, they would have to think twice.

In a place like this, one would not rest until one of them died.

Either the other party died or him.

Of course, some cultivators did not hide their internal qi and were tremendously confident in their strength.

Along the way, only low-level Demonic Beasts appeared. Chang Hu and the others could not even be bothered to take the demon cores of these Demonic Beasts.

After they left, some weaker cultivators swarmed up and fought for the Demonic Beast corpses.

“This is what I’ve set my eyes on!”

“You’re courting death. You want to devour two Demonic Beasts all by yourself?”

A commotion sounded behind them.

“This is the outermost purgatory. The deeper you go, the stronger the Demonic Beast will become.”

Wu Mei could tell that it was Qin Yu’s first time here, so she gave him a detailed introduction.

A few of them moved very quickly and arrived at an area.

Smoke billowed in this area, and the air filled with the stench of decay.

Furthermore, there was no sunlight in purgatory. With only nighttime, this environment was even more depressing.

In the depths of the forests hidden in the dark, there were occasionally a few roars of beasts with a steady internal qi.

“This is the third level of the purgatory. Here we have to be careful and act quickly, not cause too much commotion. Otherwise, it was very likely to attract the attention of the Demonic Beast in the inner depth.”

Chang Hu said in a deep voice.

“Stop! Get ready for battle.”

Wu Mei suddenly said.

Several tens of minutes later, about 30 to 40 pairs of yellow pupils appeared near the space where Qin Yu and the others were.

“These Demonic Beasts have already gained intelligence. Moreover, they seem to have formed an organization and have already surrounded us.”

Qin Yu did not have much contact with Demonic Beast, so he was a little curious at this moment.

These Demonic Beast gave him the feeling that they were like human cultivators and had their own intelligence.

“Among the Early-stage Mighty Realm sand wolves, there’s an Early-stage Reversion Void wolf king.”

Wu Mei said softly.

“Kill them!”

Feng’s body moved, charged, and killed the wolves.

The sword edge flashed with a cold light, and blood instantly splattered among the wolf pack.

Chang Hu grabbed a sand wolf with each hand and broke their spines straightaway.

Then he smashed them fiercely at the wolf pack. The two sand wolves exploded in the wolf pack like cannonballs, and four or five sand wolves instantly collapsed to the ground.

“Howl!”

A gigantic wolf king suddenly leaped high from the forest beside Qin Yu. Its wolf claws flickered with a cold light as it clawed at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu clenched his fist and was about to attack.

“Hah.”

Wu Mei aimed at the wolf king’s head with a flick of her finger.

The wolf king immediately fell to the ground as if it was drunk.

It struggled to stand up but kept spinning in circles.

“Die!”

Chang Hu jumped onto the back of the wolf king and punched it hard on the head. After four or five consecutive punches, the wolf king’s head exploded.

“Collect the spoils of war.”

He reached out and took out the wolf king’s inner core, then skin the wolf king.

“There are only two valuable parts on the body of the wolf. One is the inner core and the other is the wolf claw.”

Chang Hu explained to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu was rather surprised. The coordination of this team was really impressive.

From the preparation at the beginning to killing the wolf king, it did not even take half an hour. This efficiency was indeed terrifying.

Everyone had their own duties. No wonder most people in Solitary Cloud City were basically in groups, except for a few who walked alone.

“Continue to move forward. We’re close to the fourth level of purgatory now, so we need to be even more careful.”

Chang Hu said in a deep voice.

“I don’t understand the meaning of bringing him along.”

Feng said unhappily.

Qin Yu was basically watching the battle just now. He did not even take action when harvesting the spoils of war in the end.

“Shut up!”

Chang Hu said coldly.

Feng snorted coldly and did not continue speaking.

Qin Yu shook his head indifferently. His goal this time was to hunt Demonic Beast at the True Saint Realm.

He could not care less whether he shared the inner cores of these sand wolves and spoils of war.

“We’ve entered the fourth level of purgatory now. This small area is dominated by the black-striped tigers. When we hunt the black-striped tigers, try killing them one by one without causing any noise. The moment a group of black-striped tigers charges at us together, I’m afraid our team will be wiped out.”

Chang Hu said in a deep voice.

“Don’t worry. I won’t let these black-striped tigers have the chance to inform their companions.”

Wu Mei chuckled coquettishly, causing her body to tremble and shake.

A sturdy black-striped tiger was devouring a piece of rotten meat when a long sword suddenly pierced through its chin to the top of its head.

This black-striped tiger’s body went limp and fell to the ground. After quickly harvesting the spoils of war, they continued to hunt the next black-striped tiger.

In less than half a day, they had killed about 40 black-striped tigers.

“Keep it up. At this rate, we can complete the mission in another half a day.”

Chang Hu was smiling and in a good mood.

The completion of the mission this time was very fast, and these black-striped tigers were scattered.

Thus their hunt did not cause chaos in the fourth level of purgatory.

At this moment, a loud tiger roar came from the vicinity of Qin Yu and the others, accompanied by a violent tremor.

“How dare you kill so many of my children?”

A voice filled with suppressed anger suddenly entered their minds. Chang Hu’s expression changed drastically.

“Watch up! Get into formation.”

The ground shook violently, and tiger roars came from all directions.

That power was far superior to the sand wolf.

The terrifying tremors caused the entire fourth level of the Mystic Realm forest to tremble. Countless fallen leaves accompanied the birds flew into the sky.

The scene was like the end of the world.

A black-striped tiger shadow shot out like a bolt of lightning and crashed fiercely before Chang Hu.

Chang Hu shouted, using both hands to block this tiger’s pounce.

Then his palm pierced through the black-striped tiger’s heart like a razor and took out his inner core.

Almost instantly, another four or five ferocious tigers pounced on him.

“You’re courting death!”

Feng said coldly. At this moment, he no longer held back.

The True Saint’s aura burst out, and spiritual energy gathered on his long sword.

He confidently stepped forward, swiftly beheading four or five of the black-striped tigers that stood before him.

“Wild Rose Dance!”

Wu Mei pulled out a hundred-meter-plus-long rose and lashed it at the black-striped tigers like a whip.

The black-striped tiger was only slightly scratched by the thorns on the rose whip, and its gigantic body swayed as it fell to the ground.
