Chapter 1337: Chapter 1,337, known throughout the world 

Di zun hurriedly said, “Elder Bai, if you have any important news, you must tell me!”

“Don’t worry,”elder Bai said faintly.

In the assembly hall, there was a long table.

The sect master, who had not appeared for a long time, was sitting opposite the long table.

Besides the sect master, the deputy sect master, elders, and executive elders also arrived. They could even see a few guest elders.

This was enough to prove how important the sect master was to this matter.

Elder Bai quickly walked forward and sat down in his seat.

The first elder sat at the side of the sect master, his face filled with grief and anger.

The sect master looked like a tall and handsome young man, but everyone present knew that he was already hundreds of years old, and his strength was unfathomable.

Many years ago, he had led his disciples to conquer a large territory. Although he had retired, his strength had become increasingly powerful and mysterious.

“Sect leader, Ling Yun is my beloved disciple. Now, he was killed by two punches in front of me. There must be an end to this matter!”The great elder said furiously.

In the entire sect, perhaps only the great elder dared to speak to the sect leader like this. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The reason was because he was a meritorious official of the Tianyun sect.

The sect master’s cold gaze swept across everyone present.

He said in a deep voice, “Kill Ling Yun and wait for Yun to slap the face of our Tianyun sect. This concerns the face of our Tianyun sect. If we don’t deal with it properly, who will fear our Tianyun Sect?”

“That’s right. That Qin Yu must die,”an elder beside him said.

“Such an arrogant person must be publicly executed!”

“Ling Yun’s death must be accounted for.”

Everyone was chattering as they expressed their thoughts.

At this moment, the sect master said coldly, “I’m more concerned about who this Qin Yu is than taking revenge.”

Almost everyone’s gaze fell on elder Bai.

Elder Bai quickly stood up and recounted the whole story.

After hearing elder Bai’s words, the sect master didn’t speak for a long time.

He knocked on the table, and the sound of “Da Da”was like a knock on everyone’s heart, making them tremble.

“He has such cultivation at such a young age, why didn’t you invite him to your sect? Instead, you want to offend him?”The sect master asked coldly.

Elder BAI’s expression changed drastically!

It seemed like he wanted to hold him accountable!

“Sect master, his body is just abnormal. He can’t cultivate at all. This kind of person doesn’t have a bright future, and there’s no need to nurture him...”elder Bai hurriedly explained.

The sect master asked coldly, “How do you know that he isn’t poisoned by the Twilight Qi? If he can’t cultivate because of the twilight qi, then do you know what this means?”

Elder BAI’s expression became more and more unsightly, and beads of sweat kept breaking out on his forehead.

He had originally thought that this was his chance, but now it seemed like it was a disaster for him.

“If it’s because of the twilight qi, then it means that not only did we miss out on a peerless genius, we even offended him.”The sect master’s words became colder and colder, and even the elders couldn’t help but shudder.

“No... impossible, absolutely impossible...”elder Bai’s forehead was covered in sweat as he swallowed his saliva.

However, at this moment, the first elder coldly said, “I saw Qin Yu with Zhao Wan ‘er from the Zhao family. As far as I know, Zhao Wan ‘er was poisoned by the Twilight Qi.”

“It’s a coincidence, it must be a coincidence!”Elder Bai said with a flustered expression.

“Coincidence? If this Qin Yu wasn’t poisoned by the Twilight Qi, why would he stay with Zhao Wan ‘er?”The first elder said coldly.

“You are the instigator. If it wasn’t for you, my disciple wouldn’t have died! The Heavenly Cloud sect wouldn’t have lost face because of this!”

Elder Bai slumped onto the chair and said with a trembling voice, “Sect master, this... This is absolutely impossible...”

“How DARE YOU QUIBBLE!”The great elder shouted angrily. He clenched his fists as if he was going to make a move at any moment.

At this time, the sect master waved his hand and said, “Forget it, forget it. Don’t be rash before the matter is clarified.”

At this point, the sect master looked at elder Bai and said indifferently, “However, this matter has something to do with you. In order to make up for the Great Elder, hand over your new disciple to the Great Elder.”

New Disciple? Di Zun?

After going around and around, the first elder was actually doing this for Di Zun?

“Sect master, Di Zun is my last disciple. I Can’t hand him over to someone else...”elder Bai said unwillingly.

At this moment, the first elder slapped the table and said coldly, “That Di Zun’s talent is not inferior to Ling Yun’s. Only he can make up for it. Furthermore, with your ability, do you deserve such a genius?”

Elder Bai opened his mouth. He knew that there was no room for negotiation in this matter.

“Elder Bai, you’d better pray that Qin Yu didn’t lose all his spiritual energy because of the Twilight Qi poison. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be as simple as losing a disciple,”the great elder said coldly.

These words didn’t only mean the great elder, but also represented the sect master.

After the meeting ended, elder Bai’s face was pale, as if he had lost his parents.

He knew very well that if Qin Yu had really lost his spiritual power because of the Twilight Qi poison, then the heavenly cloud sect would very likely negotiate with him in order to get Qin Yu.

As for himself, it was very likely that he would become the condition for the negotiation and give him to Qin Yu.

“No, I absolutely won’t allow such a thing to happen!”Elder Bai’s face was vicious.

His eyes narrowed as countless thoughts flashed through his mind.

“There’s only one way now, and that is to intensify the conflict between the Heavenly Cloud sect and Qin Yu!”Elder Bai said coldly.

Only by making the conflict between the two irreconcilable could he have a chance of survival.

A hint of coldness flashed across elder Bai’s face before he laughed coldly.

“...”.

The news of Qin Yu killing Ling Yun had long spread. The entire Yang City was trembling.

They were afraid that the Tianyun sect would wipe out the entire Yang City in a fit of rage.

As Qin Yu walked on the streets of Yang City, everyone looked at Qin Yu with hostility.

“Sigh, looks like we can’t stay here any longer,”Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

Wan ‘er, who was at the side, nodded and said, “You can’t blame them. They didn’t have the ability to resist the Tianyun sect to begin with.”

“That’s right,”Qin Yu agreed. “After calculating the time, it’s indeed time to go back.”

“Where do you plan to go, Young Master Qin?”Wan ‘er asked.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “Let’s go back to Gu City. I have nowhere else to go except there.”
