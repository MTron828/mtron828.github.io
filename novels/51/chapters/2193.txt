2194 The Heavenly Origin Continent

Qin Yu did not expect the Holy Region to be so reputable in the cultivation world.

It made Qin Yu start to doubt the relationship between the Holy Region and Earth. Back then, Tianyun Sect had descended directly on Earth and brought Qin Yu and the others away.

Seeing Qin Yu not speaking, Yun Fengqing thought Qin Yu was afraid and said indifferently, “I’ve seen many people like you. After achieving a certain level of success in your own land, you want to climb the highest mountain. However, the outcome in the end is without exception. You all die in the foreign land.”

Qin Yu glanced at Yun Fengqing and said, “People must have dreams.”

“Though that is the case, I still suggest you take it step by step. With your current cultivation, I’m afraid…” Uncle Qun did not finish his sentence, but his meaning was clear.

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded to express his gratitude, then continued to ask, “Where do you plan to go?”

“We’re going to the Holy Land of Cultivation. It’s not inferior to the Holy Region!” Yun Qingyun said somewhat excitedly.

Uncle Qun, by the side, nodded and said, “That’s right. We only have one destination on this trip, the Heavenly Origin Continent. It’s a vast land, and it’s a place where heaven’s favorites fight for it.”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and seemed to have never heard of this place. However, since it was said to be quite similar to the Holy Region, it should be a good place.

“It is a rather vast and powerful continent. There must be a formation that leads to the Holy Region or Earth,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu looked at them and said, “Then I’ll listen to you and head to the Heavenly Origin Continent.”

“The Heavenly Origin Continent isn’t a place for someone like you.” There was an unconcealable contempt in Yun Fengqing’s tone of voice.

“Those who can go to the Heavenly Origin Continent are all heaven’s favorites,” he said indifferently. “Take me as an example. It only took me 300 years to reach the Semi-Saint realm. If I hadn’t encountered a bottleneck to the True Saint realm, I definitely wouldn’t have been in such a hurry to head to the Heavenly Origin Continent.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly.

He took 300 years to step into the Semi-Saint Realm. His talent was indeed not bad.

However, under the Golden Age, he was probably not qualified to compete with heaven’s favorites.

“How is it? Are you scared now?” Yun Fengqing said smugly.

However, Qin Yu did not care about Yun Fengqing. Instead, he casually asked, “Since you have a destination, why don’t you use a teleportation formation to go to the Heavenly Origin Continent?”

Upon hearing Qin Yu’s words, everyone exchanged puzzled glances, and Yun Fengqing could not help but burst into laughter.

Qin Yu frowned slightly, his eyes filled with confusion.

Yun Qingyun smiled and said, “Qin Wuji, do you really not know, or are you deliberately teasing us?”

“What do you mean?” Qin Yu asked in confusion.

“Little rookie.” Yun Fengqing could not help but laugh.

“You know nothing but still dare to venture out in the starry sky?”

“Our Yun family is extremely far away from the Heavenly Origin Continent. No one can create such a stable teleportation array. It would be highly unstable even if someone is fortunate enough to create one. There is also a high chance of dying in the wormhole.

“Moreover, since it’s experiential learning, it’s naturally better to rely on warships. For example, we’ve encountered many evildoers on this trip. It was Brother Fengqing and me who took action and solved the trouble. All these are part of cultivation.”

Qin Yu listened to their explanation and nodded, beginning to understand their point of view.

All the various challenges and difficulties encountered during the learning process were important parts of a cultivator’s growth and improvement. Only by relying on one’s own strength to solve problems could one truly experience the significance of cultivation.

“On the way to star field, you will encounter many obstacles. These people have always relied on robbery to survive, so it is better to be careful,” Uncle Qun reminded.

Yun Fengqing patted his chest and said, “With me around, nothing will happen. I’ll kill whoever comes!”

Uncle Qun nodded slightly and said with a gratifying expression, “It’s only 300 years, but Fengqing’s cultivation is already on par with mine. His future achievements are limitless.”

When saying this, Uncle Qun looked at Yun Qingyun and said, “Qingyun’s strength is slightly inferior, but her talent isn’t weaker than Fengqing’s.”

Qin Yu, by the side, was silent.

Those who dared to rob others on the journey to the star field would definitely have a high cultivation level, especially in the Golden Age. Without the True Saint Realm, who would dare to come rashly to such a dangerous area?

This group of people was just fortunate that they had encountered noobs. Otherwise, they would have been killed long ago.

“The few people I met not long ago. I…”

“How long will it take to reach the Heavenly Origin Continent?” Yun Fengqing was just about to boast when he was interrupted by Qin Yu, which instantly aroused his dissatisfaction.

“Why is the hurry? Are you in a hurry to die on the Heavenly Origin Continent?” Yun Fengqing said with a dark face.

Qin Yu could not be bothered by him and looked at Uncle Qun.

Uncle Qun estimated the time and said, “At least half a year.”

“So slow?” Qin Yu frowned.

Fengqing snorted coldly and said, “If you feel it’s too slow, you can go yourself!”

Uncle Qun did not have such a bad temper. He waved his hand and said, “There’s nothing we can do. Although my Yun family is a first-class aristocratic family, it’s already at the end of its path in the entire cultivation world. Even this warship is an antique from countless years ago.”

Qin Yu thought for a moment. It was indeed true.

The fact that reaching the pinnacle required only a Semi-Saint was evident that the Yun family was not really a top-notch great aristocratic family.

“If we really encounter bandits, we can rob their warships and speed up,” Qin Yu muttered.

Upon hearing Qin Yu’s words, Yun Fengqing could not help but sneer and say, “You’re really talking without knowing the difficulties involved. Do you think you can seize their warship? Just you?”

“Of course, I can’t, but with a heaven’s favorite like you around, I think it shouldn’t be a problem,” Qin Yu teased and said.

After saying this, Qin Yu stood up and left the place. He then returned to his courtyard.

He sealed the courtyard again to prevent anyone from disturbing him.

Sitting in the courtyard, Qin Yu could not help but recall the past of the Holy Region.

Scenes kept appearing in his mind. Now that decades had passed, no one knew what changes had happened in the Holy Region.

“Ruoxue, are you alright…” Qin Yu murmured, could not help but clench his fists.

Thinking of Yan Ruoxue’s tearful face, Qin Yu’s heart ached. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“The nine great aristocratic families… I’ll be back soon.” Qin Yu’s face was cold, and a strong killing intent rose from the bottom of his heart.

Qin Yu did not leave the courtyard for the following few days. He closed his eyes and adjusted his internal qi, waiting for his arrival on the Heavenly Origin Continent.
