Chapter 1419: Chapter 1,419, he teng? ! 1

The sect master was not angry when he heard Qin Yu’s scolding.

His hand glowed and he said coldly, “It’s useless to say anything. You’re dead.”

Then, the sect master slowly raised his hand.

An extremely powerful aura was rapidly condensing. This aura was many times stronger than the first elder!

Even Qin Yu could feel the power of this aura and couldn’t help but break out in cold sweat.

The sect master coldly glanced at Qin Yu, then his large hand covered over Qin Yu!

At this moment, black fog suddenly flashed around Qin Yu’s body.

This Black Fog’s aura was enormous, blotting out the sky and covering the Sun. It also carried waves of nauseating aura.

In the next second, a hand reached out from the black mist and grabbed Qin Yu before disappearing into space.

All of this happened in an instant.

Even the sect leader of the Heavenly Cloud sect didn’t have time to stop it.

Qin Yu’s surroundings were pitch black.

In front of him was a man wearing a black robe and emitting a foul smell.

He brought Qin Yu and jumped in space.

It was a jump, not a shuttle.

This speed could be said to be the ultimate!

Qin Yu looked at the back of this person and said coldly, “Who are you?”

The other party didn’t pay attention to him and only sped through space.

Qin Yu narrowed her eyes and looked at the back of this person and said coldly, “You Are... He Teng!”

Hearing this, the other party finally responded.

“Hehehe... I didn’t expect you to still remember me...”he teng’s gloomy voice sounded in Qin Yu’s ears.

Qin Yu said coldly, “I didn’t expect you to come to the holy region too.”

After saying that, Qin Yu looked around.

The surroundings were pitch-black. It was the void that was hidden under the space.

It had to be said that he teng’s spatial technique was extremely brilliant. No wonder he escaped from Qin Yu’s hands repeatedly!

After traveling for a short ten minutes, the two of them had escaped from the Heavenly Cloud sect.

He Teng brought Qin Yu to a desolate place. This place was completely deserted.

He threw Qin Yu on the ground and said with a sinister tone, “Qin Yu, we meet again...”

Qin Yu narrowed her eyes and said, “Why did you save me?”

“Save You? hahahahaha, this is the funniest joke in my life. me? Save You? !”He Teng couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

Qin Yu frowned. Of course, he knew that he teng wouldn’t be so kind, but he did bring him out from the hands of the Heavenly Cloud sect.

“Qin Yu, I hate you to the bone. Why would I save you?”He Teng said with a sneer.

“What exactly do you want? Just say it.”Qin Yu snorted coldly.

He Teng moved his face closer. At this moment, his face was no longer human. His voice seemed to be a fusion of two sounds, which was extremely strange.

“This body of yours can’t be wasted like this...”He Teng said darkly.

“So you’re doing it for this body.”Qin Yu frowned and said.

He teng sneered, “What else? Do you think I’ll Save You? I Can’t wait to Skin You Alive!”

After saying that, he teng suddenly turned around and kicked Qin Yu’s chest!

Qin Yu’s body was instantly sent flying hundreds of meters!

In just a short moment, he teng appeared in front of Qin Yu.

He suddenly elbowed Qin Yu’s back.

Qin Yu’s body instantly fell to the ground like a cannonball!

The current Qin Yu was still bound by the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s chains, so he had no way to retaliate and could only let he teng torture him.

He Teng grabbed Qin Yu and beat him up until he was tired. Only then did he throw Qin Yu to the side.

“Your body is really tempting...”he teng licked his lips and said.

Qin Yu looked at he teng coldly and said, “What do you want? Just be straightforward.”

He Teng narrowed his eyes and said, “Okay, since you are in such a hurry, I will send you on Your Way...”

After saying that, he teng put his hands together and a strange aura gathered in his body.

He opened his mouth slightly and murmured in a low voice, as if he was using some strange spell.

“Buzz!”

A Ray of light gathered towards the center of Qin Yu’s brows.

That Ray of light enveloped Qin Yu’s forehead and directly entered Qin Yu’s spiritual sense.

“Spiritual Sense Attack!”Qin Yu’s expression instantly changed greatly!

He Teng’s malice was beyond imagination. He actually planned to first chop off Qin Yu’s spiritual sense and then occupy this body!

Qin Yu’s mind instantly burst out with a powerful force, directly forcing Qin Yu’s spiritual sense to invade!

“Clang!”

At this moment, a beam of light suddenly appeared in Qin Yu’s spiritual sense.

This beam of light collided with the Killing Force!

The spell he teng cast was canceled out in an instant. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The layer of armor covering Qin Yu’s primordial spirit also disappeared.

Qin Yu immediately gasped for breath, feeling extremely terrified.

He was so close! He was so close to dying here!

“Eh?”

He Teng frowned. He looked coldly at Qin Yu and said, “Your primordial spirit... is actually so powerful?”

Qin Yu suppressed the terror in his heart and pretended to be calm. “Do you think that I only know how to cultivate my physical body? If I only have a physical body, once I encounter a spiritual spell, wouldn’t I have no choice but to wait for death?”

He Teng narrowed his eyes, his vulture-like gaze coldly looking at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu was extremely nervous. He was very afraid that he teng would use another spiritual spell!

If that was the case, Qin Yu would definitely die!

He Teng stared at Qin Yu. After a while, he said coldly, “You are quite comprehensive...”

Qin Yu snorted and said, “He teng, don’t waste your energy. The entire heavenly cloud sect can’t do anything to me, let alone you.”

He Teng was somewhat annoyed. He punched Qin Yu’s face.

Then, he gnashed his teeth and said, “Seeing your face, I want to tear you into pieces!”

Qin Yu laughed and said, “Unfortunately, you don’t have that ability!”

Their eyes met. Qin Yu’s gaze was extremely determined.

He didn’t dare to show any fear, afraid that he teng would notice something.

After a moment, he teng said coldly, “Qin Yu, before I think of a way to seize your body, you’d better not die...”

“Don’t worry, even if you die, I won’t die,”Qin Yu said coldly.

He Teng didn’t say anything more. His body turned into a cloud of black fog and surged in all directions.

In a short moment, he disappeared without a trace.

Only after he teng had walked far away did Qin Yu gasp for breath.

His sweat was like a waterfall, flowing down with a pitter-patter.

“I almost... almost died.”Qin Yu collapsed on the ground.

This was the closest he felt to death.
