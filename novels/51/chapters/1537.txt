Chapter 1538: Chapter 1,538, awe-inspiring righteousness

Qin Yu’s internal Qi was still extremely calm.

He crushed this sacred seal effortlessly!

“How terrifying...”the spectators couldn’t help but turn pale with fright!

“Could it be that Qin Yu, who has just stepped into the mighty realm, is already on par with the three madmen and three deadly ones?”

“He has just stepped into the mighty realm and already has such abilities. Qin Yu is enough to change the situation of this battle!”

It wasn’t just the onlookers. Even Huai Chang and Yongji’s expressions became a little strange.

They didn’t even know whether to be happy or worried. They had worked hard for countless years, but now, a junior had easily surpassed them. How could they endure this! !

“Qin Yu, you...”the deputy sect leader’s expression was terrifyingly ugly!

Qin Yu looked down at the deputy sect master and said, “I said that the current you is no match for me. No matter what trump card you have.”

The deputy sect master said somewhat angrily, “Absolutely impossible!”

After saying that, the deputy sect master’s entire body erupted with an intense baleful aura. Rays of light leaped out from his body and headed straight for Qin Yu!

However, this time, Qin Yu did not even Dodge, allowing the rays of light to strike his body.

Crackling sounds continued to ring out as white marks appeared on Qin Yu’s body.

......

These white marks disappeared quickly, leaving no traces behind.

“What a terrifying body!”

“This kid actually managed to withstand it with just his body!”

“Even Yongji and the others wouldn’t be able to achieve such a body!”

The deputy sect leader was on the verge of collapse! He had never thought that Qin Yu, who had stepped into the mighty realm, would actually be so powerful! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“I have no enmity with you. If you leave the Heavenly Cloud sect now, I can spare your life,”Qin Yu said coldly.

The deputy sect leader angrily shouted, “Absolutely impossible! Anyone who wants to insult the heavenly cloud sect at this stage is my enemy!”

Qin Yu remained silent, his face unusually cold.

Qin Yu’s participation in the battle caused the originally stable battle situation to begin to change.

First Elder was pushed back by Huai Chang, vomiting blood non-stop.

Huai Chang, who had taken out an empty space, immediately assisted Yong Ji and began to attack the eighteen godly men.

This made the unrivalled eighteen godly men feel extremely exhausted, and they retreated continuously.

“Do you still want to continue? The Heavenly Cloud Sect is definitely going to lose,”Qin Yu said coldly.

The deputy sect master gritted his teeth and said, “Qin Yu, let me tell you, even if I die in battle today, I Will Never Run!”

“You do have some backbone.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

At this moment, the crowd that was watching in the dark also appeared one after another.

They seemed to have met the end of the heavenly cloud sect and immediately shouted, “Today is the day the Heavenly Cloud sect is destroyed!”

Everyone pushed down the wall. Everyone seemed to have started to make things difficult for the Tianyun sect.

The angry roars from the surroundings surged like a tide. This deafening voice made the disciples of the Tianyun sect afraid.

Countless disciples died in battle. Their corpses lay on the ground and blood flowed like a river.

“So many people died in battle. Do you still want to continue?”Qin Yu said coldly.

The deputy sect master narrowed his eyes. He gritted his teeth and said, “Qin Yu, my will can not be changed with just a few words from you. If you have the guts, come with me!”

With that said, the deputy sect master turned around and ran!

Qin Yu sighed slightly. The deputy sect master’s strength was not even comparable to the first elder’s. Qin Yu could kill him effortlessly.

He did not think too much and immediately chased after him.

With the addition of everyone, the Heavenly Cloud sect was already in disarray, and the eighteen godly men were also retreating in defeat!

For a time, the entire heavenly cloud sect was reduced to ruins. The former number one sect had now fallen to such a state.

The cultivation mountain in the distance was still unmoving. The sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect clearly had no intention of coming out of seclusion.

Qin Yu followed the deputy sect master all the way to the depths of the heavenly cloud sect.

When Qin Yu arrived, the deputy sect master seemed to be chewing something in his mouth, and his internal Qi also began to become a little restless.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said, “The pill that raises one’s strength can’t change the battle situation.”

The deputy sect master gritted his teeth and said, “Even if it can’t change the battle situation, I’ll make you pay the price! You’re an accomplice of the northern lands!”

“Accomplice of the northern lands? What do you mean?”Qin Yu frowned tightly.

However, the deputy sect leader did not reply. He seemed to have fallen into madness as he charged towards Qin Yu.

After storing the pill, the deputy sect leader’s strength had obviously increased. Moreover, his attacks were also without rhyme or reason.

However, in the face of absolute strength, it was of no use. Qin Yu dodged as he asked.

However, the deputy sect leader seemed to have lost consciousness. Other than attacking, he had no other consciousness.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He knew that he could not get anything out of the deputy sect leader, so he did not waste any more time.

“Since you are so stubborn, I will send you on your way,”Qin Yu said coldly.

After saying that, Qin Yu’s body emitted a golden light. His incomparably fierce fist arrived with a bang!

“Bang!”

With just a single punch, half of the vice sect master’s body was shattered!

His body fell to the ground, bleeding non-stop!

The vice sect master tried to get up, but he realized that he couldn’t get up at all!

Only at this moment did he realize that he and the current Qin Yu were on completely different levels.

Qin Yu slowly walked towards the vice sect master step by step.

Looking at the deputy sect leader’s struggling expression, Qin Yu turned a blind eye.

“What’s the point of being so stubborn?”Qin Yu looked down at the deputy sect leader.

Blood continuously dripped from the deputy sect leader’s mouth, but he still said unyieldingly, “Everyone has their own perseverance. A human like you wouldn’t understand...”

Hearing this, Qin Yu felt a little emotional.

Yes, everyone has their own perseverance. Perhaps to the vice sect master, his perseverance was to protect the Tianyun sect.

“Protecting a small sect... is it really meaningful?”Qin Yu shook his head.

The vice sect master grinned and said, “I’m not only protecting the Tianyun sect, but also the South Province! Even if I die, the people of the South Province will remember me in the future! They won’t remember you!”

Qin Yu did not want to continue arguing with him, so he shook his head and said, “No matter what you say, the Heavenly Cloud sect is going to become a thing of the past.”

“Qin Yu, don’t be complacent too early! Do you really think that just the few of you can defeat the Heavenly Cloud sect! ! “If not for the southern region, if not for the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s foundation being sent to the borders and the various major cities, do you really think that you can get your hands on the Heavenly Cloud sect with just the few of you! ?”The deputy sect master shouted at the top of his voice, he looked extremely sorrowful!

After hearing the Deputy Sect Master’s words, Qin Yu was instantly stunned.

He looked at the Deputy Sect Master in a daze and said, “You... What did you say?”

“What did I say? Hahaha, you wouldn’t understand. Do It!”The deputy sect master closed his eyes, clearly looking for death.

Qin Yu grabbed the deputy sect master and said coldly, “You said that the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s foundation was sent to the Borders by you? What do you mean?”
