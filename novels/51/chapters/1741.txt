Chapter 1742: Never Give Up

“Boom!”

It was like a muffled thunder had sounded in the sky. This muffled sound resounded through more than half of Nanzhou!

Everyone was shocked by the sound. Although they didn’t know what had happened, they could already guess what had happened!

Yuan Xiu must have arrived!

!!

The Divine Capital City was densely packed with divine inscriptions, resisting the blow of the gigantic ax!

All of the divine inscriptions flickered with a blinding golden light. It was as if they had formed a huge net that resisted the gigantic ax!

The gigantic ax’s strike slowly dissipated, but the divine inscriptions did not dissipate for a long time!

Seeing this, Sima Bei and the others heaved a sigh of relief.

Fortunately, the divine inscriptions had managed to withstand the attack. Otherwise, the three of them would have been regarded as trash by Yuan Xiu.

“You do have some ability.” Yuan Xiu could not help but sneer as he looked at the city.

“But even if you can withstand one blow, can you withstand the second?”

Yuan Xiu then swung his ax down again!

This time, the Divine Inscription Formation’s radiance grew even brighter!

Although it had still managed to withstand this attack, the Divine Inscription Formation seemed to have reached its limit!

Even after the gigantic ax had disappeared, the divine inscription still refused to dissipate and its light seemed to have dimmed a little!

Seeing this, Sima Bei and the others were greatly shocked!

“The Divine Inscription Formation is really going to be broken!” Sima Bei shouted excitedly!

Yong Ji and He Teng, who were standing at the side, were equally shocked. They were well aware of how terrifying this Divine Inscription Formation was. However, Yuan Xiu had actually managed to destroy it with just two blows!

What kind of strength was this? It was too terrifying!

A perfect body Yuan Xiu was even more terrifying than one could imagine!

“Hmph, to be able to withstand two of my ax strikes, you must have some ability.” Yuan Xiu sneered.

Right at this time, they suddenly felt numerous auras currently closing in on them!

“What?” Yuan Xiu could not help but look in a certain direction in the distance.

“This aura… It’s Qin Yu!” He Teng’s expression turned cold and he couldn’t help but clench his teeth.

Soon, Qin Yu and Wen Wanchong appeared in the air on the Divine Eagle.

“He’s here, as expected.” Qin Yu’s face turned cold. He put away the Divine Eagle and jumped down from the sky.

Seeing Qin Yu and Wen Wanchong rushing over, Yuan Xiu’s face showed a trace of mockery and amusement.

He put away the gigantic ax and looked at Qin Yu coldly.

“Qin Yu, you actually dare to appear in front of me.” Yuan Xiu placed his hands behind his back and said indifferently.

Qin Yu did not speak. He tried to sense the aura of Yuan Xiu, but he could not detect anything.

This could only mean one thing – the current Yuan Xiu was more terrifying than they had imagined!

“Brat, are you here to die? The current Lord is definitely not someone you can touch. If you know what’s good for you, then quickly get lost!” He Teng suddenly roared and charged at Qin Yu!

The moment he said that, everyone looked at He Teng.

He Teng’s words seemed to be mocking, but in reality, he was trying to force Qin Yu to leave this place!

“Slap!”

Yuan Xiu’s face turned cold and he slapped He Teng’s body.

This slap directly smashed half of He Teng’s body into pieces! It was even more tragic than Sima Bei’s!

“What, you want to save him?” Yuan Xiu said with squinted eyes.

He Teng crawled up from the ground with difficulty and said in an extremely flattering manner, “Lord, I absolutely didn’t mean it that way…”

“Do you think I’m an idiot?” Yuan Xiu shouted as a terrifying aura burst forth from his body.

Just this aura alone instantly pressed He Teng to the ground!

This aura was like thousands of mountains, practically about to crush He Teng’s body!

Not far away, Qin Yu could not help but frown.

Of course, he knew He Teng’s intentions. He was afraid that Qin Yu would die at the hands of Yuan Xiu and thus destroy his physical body.

“Yuan Xiu, He Teng is one of your own. Why are you so cruel to your own people?” Qin Yu said coldly.

Yuan Xiu shot a glance at Qin Yu. His sharp eyes suddenly burst forth with an extremely terrifying power!

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically! He only felt an extremely powerful force approach!

Qin Yu didn’t dare to think too much. He hurriedly crossed his arms in front of him, trying to block the blow.

However, the power of his gaze was too terrifying. It almost forced Qin Yu to retreat in an instant, and his arm was almost broken!

Qin Yu got up from the ground. He looked at his arms and saw that they had been torn.

“This Yuan Xiu… He’s so scary!” Qin Yu’s face turned even more solemn!

Yuan Xiu not far away was also shocked.

“You’re only at the Mighty Realm, but you can actually withstand it. Not bad.” Yuan Xiu said indifferently.

He let go of He Teng on the ground and turned to look at Qin Yu.

He Teng, who was on the ground, could finally catch his breath. He hurriedly stood up and circulated his cultivation technique to recover his body.

“Qin Yu, I admire your courage. If I were you, I would run as far away as possible.” Yuan Xiu said indifferently.

Cold sweat broke out on Qin Yu’s forehead. He adjusted the aura in his body and immediately got ready for a great battle. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“F*ck you, Yuan Xiu. do you think that everyone is willing to be a coward like you? ” at this time, Wen Wanchong shouted at Yuan Xiu!

Yuan Xiu glanced at Wen Wanchong and sneered, “I remember you. You’re the old man who suddenly attacked last time.”

“You’re the f*cking old man! I’m a f*cking young man!” Wen Wanchong said in an annoyed tone.

Yuan Xiu ignored Wen Wanchong’s nonsense. He placed his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Do you think you can stop me?”

Qu Zhu’s figure appeared in front of them before he could finish speaking.

“Oh? Everyone seems to have arrived.” Yuan Xiu smiled.

Qu Zhu didn’t say anything but walked to Wen Wanchong’s side.

“This Yuan Xiu is more terrifying than I thought. Be careful.” Wen Wanchong whispered.

Qu Zhu nodded. “I can tell. But we’re already here. There’s no way out.”

“Then let’s fight. Whether we live or die, I, Wen Wanchong, will be remembered in the history of Nanzhou!” Wen Wanchong roared, his muscles bulged and his clothes were torn to pieces!

At this moment, Wen Wanchong looked like he had gone mad, and his aura was extremely terrifying!

Qu Zhu also adjusted his breathing at this moment, preparing for battle.

“No, the difference in strength is still too big.” Qin Yu gritted his teeth.

Even though Wen Wanchong and Qu Zhu’s auras were already very terrifying, he could still sense that they were still far from being comparable to Yuan Xiu!

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He activated the fifth level of the fighting word formula and jumped in front of the two.

“Qin Yu, you’d better not interfere in this battle.” Wen Wanchong said coldly.

“How would we know if we don’t try?” Qin Yu clenched his fists and said.
