Chapter 539: Qin Yu’s Outburst! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Han Wei’s internal qi suddenly skyrocketed, causing everyone to turn pale with fright!

Even Qin Yu’s expression was unsightly!

This power... was indeed that of the Martial Marquis Realm!

“Han Wei actually broke through at this time?” Someone frowned and asked.

“That’s not right. Stepping into Martial Marquis Realm will definitely bring about a heavenly tribulation, but Han Wei didn’t.”

Yan Jinyao, who had been silent all this time, said nonchalantly, “This is a secret technique. This technique can allow a person to step into the Martial Marquis Realm within a short period of time, but it can’t be maintained for too long. At most, it can last for half an hour.”

“I’ve also heard of it. Rumor has it that using this technique has a great impact on the body. It can cause serious injuries at the slightest, and at the worst, it can affect one’s future cultivation advancement.” Chu Heng also nodded slightly.

“Looks like Han Wei has really been forced into a corner. Even at such a great risk, he still wants to kill Qin Yu.”

“If Qin Yu doesn’t die today, he will definitely become our great enemy in the future.”

They didn’t say anything more and looked in the direction of the battlefield.

Han Wei’s internal qi had already reached another level. Under this internal qi, even Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little worried.

One had to know that after stepping into the Martial Marquis realm, one’s strength would enter another level.

This was no longer a question of whether one could cross ranks to fight. It was equivalent to two different worlds!

“Bring it on!” Han Wei roared at Qin Yu!

Just a single roar caused the air to buzz!

The internal qi contained within was like a bomb pressing towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu hurriedly crossed his arms in front of his forehead to protect his face.

“Clang!”

But even so, Qin Yu was still pushed back repeatedly by this force!

“Martial Marquises really live up to their reputation.” Qin Yu’s expression was unsightly.

Just a single roar contained such power. This blow could demolish dimensions.

Facing Han Wei, who had reached Martial Marquis, Qin Yu didn’t dare to be negligent.

He took a deep breath and summoned the Venerable Fifth Mountain.

Looking at the Venerable Fifth Mountain hanging above his head, Han Wei couldn’t help but laugh maniacally. “Qin Yu, in the face of absolute strength, any Magic Artifact won’t be worth mentioning!”

With that said, Han Wei stepped forward!

Each of his steps seemed extremely powerful, causing one’s ears to buzz!

“Boom!”

Han Wei waved his large hand, and the seemingly flimsy move sent Qin Yu flying!

Under this palm strike, even the Venerable Fifth Mountain above his head began to shake slightly, as if it was about to be sent flying!

Qin Yu climbed up from the ground. He gritted his teeth and said in a low voice, “When facing a Martial Marquis, I have no strength to retaliate at all...”

“Boom!”

Before Qin Yu could react, Han Wei threw another punch!

Qin Yu didn’t dare to take the punch head-on. He hurriedly retreated.

However, even the wind from the punch forced Qin Yu back. His body suffered a strong impact.

“Hahahaha!” Han Wei burst into laughter.

“Is this the strength of Martial Marquis? Hahahaha, Qin Yu, you’re dead meat today!”

Following Han Wei’s loud shout, he took a step towards Qin Yu!

His extremely fast speed even left an afterimage on the spot!

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. He once again used the Heavy Falling Space in an attempt to block Han Wei.

However, Han Wei, who had reached the realm of Martial Marquis, wasn’t affected at all. He only shook his body and broke through the Heavy Falling Space!

“None of your spells are worth mentioning, hahaha!” Han Wei laughed crazily.

His internal qi was suddenly released, and Qin Yu immediately felt as if his shoulders were withstanding a tremendous force. He was unable to move!

“Bang!”

Han Wei’s fist suddenly smashed Qin Yu’s chest!

Qin Yu’s chest instantly sank down, and his hard physical body wasn’t worth mentioning at this moment!

“Wah!”

A mouthful of fresh blood was suddenly spat out from his mouth. His internal organs seemed to have suffered a great impact!

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He endured the pain in his body and tried to stand up.

But at this moment, Han Wei had already taken another step forward!

He raised his foot and kicked Qin Yu’s body.

“Clang!”

Qin Yu’s body, which was just about to stand up, sank into the ground again!

Even his body began to show cracks, and all the golden light disappeared!

“Do you still remember? I trampled on you like this back then!” Han Wei laughed crazily.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. His expression was extremely ugly, and he felt a strong sense of humiliation inside!

“No... I must not suffer humiliation in front of Ruoxue!” Qin Yu said painfully.

He knew that Yan Ruoxue was watching from upstairs!

Suffering humiliation in front of the woman he loved was torture!

“Ah!!”

Qin Yu tried his best to get up, but the gap between their realms was impossible to cross, and none of his moves were worth mentioning!

On the stage, the Pavilion Master’s expression was a bit ugly.

She slowly got up, as if she wanted to make a move.

“Don’t be anxious.” At this moment, Old Mister Yan stopped the Pavilion Master.

“Give him some time. I believe that Qin Yu won’t fall just like that.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The Pavilion Master frowned. Although she was unable to bear it, she ultimately sat down.

“Qin Yu, if I can trample on you the first time, I can trample on you a second time and a third time! You are just a maggot that exists to be trampled on by me!”

Han Wei laughed crazily with an unhinged expression!

“Han Wei, don’t waste time. Kill him directly!” Xia Hang shouted from above.

He knew very well that Han Wei only had half an hour.

If Qin Yu could stall for half an hour, then Han Wei would have no chance on winning at all!

Han Wei lowered his head and looked at Qin Yu, who was trampled on. He grinned and said, “Although I don’t want you to die so easily, there’s nothing I can do. They all want you to die as soon as possible...”

“So, you’d better die!”

As he spoke, light began to gather in Han Wei’s palm.

This power contained the power to destroy the world. Even though it was far away, it still made people tremble in fear!

“Qin Yu!” The Pavilion Master seemed to be unable to hold it in anymore. She stood up angrily as she watched this venue.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s eyes were closed.

Countless rays of light flashed in his mind, and countless spells flashed past.

“My father must have left behind similar spells!” Qin Yu roared inside!

“Quick, I must find it as soon as possible!”

“If you can forcefully enter the Martial Marquis Realm, so can I!”

The light in Han Wei’s palm grew stronger, and the entire ground began to tremble!

“Go to h*ll!” Han Wei roared angrily, and the light in his hand immediately dragged forward!

“Boom!”

In an instant, the venue turned into a vast expanse of white, and almost nothing could be seen clearly!

Xia Hang, who was on the stage, saw this and finally heaved a sigh of relief.

“We’ve finally solved this big problem.” Xia Hang patted his chest.

The venue was silent, and everyone was staring at the center of the vast expanse of white.

“Huh? What’s that golden light?!”

“It’s Qin Yu? He... he actually didn’t die!”

“How is this possible! ?”

With a glance, they could only see a figure standing in the center of the vast expanse of white.

The human figure clenched his fists. His eyes were ice-cold, and his body was once again tainted with golden light!
