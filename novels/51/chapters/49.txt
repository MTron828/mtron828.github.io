Qin Yu glanced at them and said coldly, “Idiot.”

After saying this, Qin Yu strode into the venue with Yao Qing.

“D*mn it, how dare you scold me!” Su Yan said angrily.

Zhao Gang snorted while saying, “It’s okay. He won’t be on his high horse for long.”

Then, Zhao Gang told Shen Yun about Qin Yu’s arrival.

Shen Yun couldn’t help but laugh after hearing it. “How could a good-for-nothing like him get his hands on this kind of business? What a joke!”

“Yeah, yeah, I think so too!” Zhao Gang also shouted.

Most of the businessmen surrounded Shen Yun.

They all knew about the conflict between Qin Yu and the Shen family, so no one was willing to get close to Qin Yu.

“President Shen, when you bring in the big bucks, don’t forget us!”

“That’s right, President Shen, just give us a first-level agent opportunity!”

“When the time comes, our factory can OEM for your company!”

Shen Yun, his eyes fixed in the direction of Qin Yu, acted as if he didn’t hear anything.

Thinking of his son, Shen Tian, who was still bed-ridden, Shen Yun wished that he could tear Qin Yu into pieces!

Someone followed Shen Yun’s gaze and looked over, then realization dawned upon him.

“I didn’t expect that Qin Yu would also come!” A businessman deliberately shouted and then walked in the direction of Qin Yu.

This businessman was called Sun Peng. He was the head of the medicinal herbs processing factory in Jiangcheng. However, in Jiangcheng, Sun Peng wasn’t a big shot. He wasn’t even qualified to attend the Yan family’s banquet.

If they seized the opportunity to cooperate with the Shen family this time, the Sun family had a chance to become one of the upper families in Jiangcheng!

In order to curry favor with Shen Yun, Sun Peng took the initiative to walk over to Qin Yu.

“Mr. Qin, why are you here?” Sun Peng pretended to be concerned and asked.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “Do I know you?”

Sun Peng smiled and said, “You don’t know me, but I know you. You are a famous figure in Jiangcheng. Who doesn’t know that you are the number one scoundrel in Jiangcheng?”

After saying that, Sun Peng burst into laughter.

Qin Yu wasn’t angry. He just looked at Sun Peng and sneered as he said, “Do you think that by pleasing the Shen family, you are qualified to participate in the business of the Soul Nourishment Pill?”

Sun Peng said with a smile, “What else? Don’t tell me I should try to please you?”

“Pleasing me might be more useful,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

Hearing this, Sun Peng couldn’t help but laugh.

“You are too full of yourself,” Sun Peng sneered.

“That old doctor said that he wants to find a company with strength to cooperate with! Who is the most qualified? Of course, it’s President Shen!”

“What about you? What qualifications do you have?”

Qin Yu glanced at Sun Peng and said with a nonchalant smile, “I indeed don’t have much qualifications, but maybe I am that old doctor?”

“Hahaha!” Sun Peng laughed even more exaggeratedly.

“If you are that old doctor, I, Sun Peng, will write my name upside down!”

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered to argue with such a petty person, so he turned his head to the side and ignored him.

Seeing Qin Yu ignore him, Sun Peng ran back to Shen Yun in an obsequious manner.

Shen Yun glanced at Sun Peng and said indifferently, “Well done.”

“Thank you, President Shen!” Sun Peng was overjoyed!

The rest of the businessmen followed suit. They ran to Qin Yu to mock him and show off.

Faced with these people’s taunts, Qin Yu didn’t say a word. He just looked at them coldly and silently remembered their faces.

Soon, Shen Yun walked to Qin Yu.

He glowered at Qin Yu contemptuously and said, “I really don’t know why you are here. Are you asking for humiliation?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“The one who is asking for humiliation isn’t me, but you,” Qin Yu said with a sneer.

When Shen Yun heard this, he snorted and said, “I want to see how long you can keep acting tough.”

At this moment, Lei Hu walked out from the backstage.

His appearance immediately attracted the attention of countless people.

Everyone walked towards Lei Hu.

“Qin Yu, let’s settle the score slowly,” Shen Yun said and walked towards Lei Hu.

“Lei Hu, where’s that old doctor?”

“Mr. Lei, invite that old doctor out quickly!”

Looking at everyone’s expectant expression, Lei Hu felt a little smug for a moment.

He cleared his throat and said, “Everyone, please be quiet. I know that everyone wants to obtain the formula for the Soul Nourishment Pill. Everyone, please be patient!”

“Stop talking nonsense and quickly invite that old doctor out,” Shen Yun said impatiently.

Lei Hu glanced at Shen Yun and said with a smile, “Why are you so impatient? If you can’t wait any longer, then get out!”
