Chapter 1535: Chapter 1,535, Vicious Woman 1

After that, Qin Yu summoned the Godly Eagle and rushed to the Zhuo family with Zhuo Jing.

After returning to the Zhuo family, there were still many guests in the Zhuo family.

When they saw the injured Zhuo Jing, they walked up one after another.

“Brother Zhuo, what happened to you?”

Qin Yu glanced at them and said, “I’ll have to trouble everyone to take care of Zhuo Jing. I want to refine medicine for Zhuo Jing.”

“Brother Qin can refine medicine?”The surrounding people asked in surprise.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Now is not the time to talk about this. I’ll have to trouble everyone to take care of him.”

After saying this, Qin Yu walked toward the Zhuo family’s warehouse.

The Zhuo family’s warehouse had a lot of herbs. Qin Yu could choose any herbs he wanted. It was not difficult to refine herbs.

After choosing the herbs, Qin Yu found a room and took out the dragon cauldron. He began to refine pills for Zhuo Jing.

On the other side, everyone surrounded Zhuo Jing and discussed animatedly.

“Qin Yu’s realm seems to have already stepped into the mighty realm.”

“That’s right. I guess he encountered difficulties during his breakthrough and brother Zhuo helped him, which resulted in this result.”

......

“Mm, this analysis is very reasonable.”

“Qin Yu, who has stepped into the mighty realm, is very powerful. I think he will soon head to the Heavenly Cloud Sect.”

Just as everyone was discussing, Qin Yu walked in with a pill.

He walked all the way to Zhuo Jing and then fed the pill into his mouth.

“Brother Qin, you’ve stepped into the Mighty Realm?”Someone beside him asked.

Qin Yu didn’t hide anything. He nodded and said, “Not bad. I was lucky to break through.”

“Congratulations, Brother Qin. Then we must celebrate today,”the group said excitedly.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “I still have something to do. There’s no need to celebrate.”

“Brother Qin, are you planning to go to the Heavenly Cloud Sect?”Someone asked.

Qin Yu did not hide this. He nodded slightly and said, “That’s right. I’m planning to go to the Heavenly Cloud Sect.”

“Sigh, the Heavenly Cloud sect is in a stalemate now. Neither side can take down the other. If Brother Qin joins the battle, the Heavenly Cloud sect will definitely lose,”someone said.

Qin Yu sneered, “Then wait for me to break through the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s mountain gate. We can celebrate then.”

At this moment, Li Yingying suddenly walked in from outside.

The moment she saw Qin Yu, a trace of panic flashed across her eyes.

“Brother... Brother Qin, did you... did you break through?”Li Yingying said somewhat awkwardly.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly. He didn’t answer. Instead, he raised his palm. A powerful suction force instantly erupted!

Li Yingying’s body drifted toward Qin Yu uncontrollably. In less than half a second, her neck was grabbed by Qin Yu’s hand!

“Brother... Brother Qin, what... What are you doing...”Li Yingying immediately panicked and struggled desperately.

“Brother Qin, why did you attack Yingying all of a sudden?”

“Brother Qin, put down Yingying first. If you have something to say, let’s talk properly.”

Qin Yu ignored everyone. He looked at Li Yingying coldly and said, “Tell Me, why do you want to kill me?”

A trace of fear flashed across Li Yingying’s eyes, but she still stubbornly said, “I... I don’t understand what you’re saying...”

“Only the three of us know about the place where I broke through. If it wasn’t for you snitching, why would Sima bei appear! Do you know that you almost caused Zhuo Jing’s death!”Qin Yu angrily shouted.

“Brother Qin, I’m afraid there’s some misunderstanding.”

“Right, Brother Qin, let’s talk it out. If you don’t let go, Yingying will really be strangled to death by you!”

Qin Yu sneered, “Such a vicious woman shouldn’t be left in this world.”

After saying that, Qin Yu looked at Li Yingying again and said, “I’ve heard the conversation between you and Zhuo Jing. You actually want to instigate Zhuo Jing to attack me. You deserve to die!”

Just when Qin Yu was about to make a move, Zhuo Jing’s voice suddenly came from the side.

“Brother Qin, forget it...”Zhuo Jing raised his hand and patted Qin Yu’s shoulder.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said, “Brother Zhuo, this woman is so vicious. Why should I let her go?”

Zhuo Jing smiled bitterly and said, “Maybe she just took the wrong path for a moment. Let Her Go.”

Hearing Qin Yu’s words, Qin Yu was silent for a moment, and his hand slowly loosened.

Five Finger prints appeared on Li Yingying’s snow-white neck. She desperately breathed in the fresh air and looked at Qin Yu with lingering fear.

“Get lost,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Li Yingying was somewhat unwilling to give up. She looked at Zhuo Jing and said, “Brother Zhuo, i...”

“I don’t want to see you again. Get lost,”Zhuo Jing said in the same cold tone.

A trace of viciousness flashed across Li Yingying’s face. She got up from the ground and didn’t say anything more. She turned around and left.

Looking at Li Yingying’s departing back, Qin Yu sighed slightly and said, “Brother Zhuo, for a person like her, sooner or later, she will be a disaster.”

Zhuo Jing smiled bitterly and said, “After all, she once helped me. Just take it as me returning her a favor.”

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude and said no more.

Then, he said goodbye to everyone and planned to leave.

Before he left, Zhuo Jing pulled Qin Yu back.

He took back the Silver Spring and handed it to Qin Yu, saying, “Brother Qin, take this with you. It should be useful to you.”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, then waved his hand and said, “No need. I don’t need this now.”

After becoming a mighty figure, Qin Yu was filled with confidence. He even felt that he was no longer afraid of void-level artifacts.

“Brother Zhuo, be careful. If you really can’t do it, go to the divine capital,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Zhuo jing smiled and said, “What danger can I be in?”

“The northern lands,”Qin Yu said with a grave expression.

Zhuo Jing instantly fell silent.

This time, he had attacked Sima Bei. He had undoubtedly offended the northern lands.

Once the people of the northern lands stepped into the southern province, they would definitely not let Zhuo Jing off.

“Alright, I understand. Brother Qin, you should also be more careful,”Zhuo Jing said.

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude and did not say anything else. He immediately summoned the Divine Eagle and left this place.

He was not in a hurry to go to the Heavenly Cloud sect. Instead, he temporarily returned to Mount Hua Ning.

After leaving for so long, it was time for him to go back and take a look. He did not want anything to happen to Wen Da and Wen Er.

On Mount Hua Ning, everything was as before.

Wen Da and Wen Er still drank all day and did not care about the affairs of the world. As for Jue Wu’s two followers, they were also influenced by them and joined the battle.

When they saw Qin Yu returning, Wen Da and Wen Er walked over unsteadily.

“Qin Yu, you’re back. How was it? Did you make a breakthrough?”Wen Da patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said.

Qin Yu grunted and then said, “Nothing happened these few days, right?”

“What could happen to us?”Wen Da waved his hand.

“That’s right, that’s right. Who would be willing to go to Hua Ning Mountain to kill people for two good-for-nothings?”Wen Er also said.

Qin Yu was stunned and couldn’t help but smile bitterly, “You two are quite self-aware. Alright, since nothing happened, I won’t waste any more time.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Where are you going?”Wen Da hurriedly asked.

“The Heavenly Cloud Sect,”Qin Yu said coldly.
