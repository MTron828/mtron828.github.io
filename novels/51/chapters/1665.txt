Li Yingying, who was about to leave, suddenly stopped in her tracks.

She didn’t say a word. It was obvious that she was a little nervous. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Qin Yu walked in front of Li Yingying. He looked at Li Yingying coldly and said, “Why do I feel that there is a strange smell on your body?”

Li Yingying was stunned. She said nervously, “What... What Smell?”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “The smell of the northern lands.”

As soon as he said that, Li Yingying’s body suddenly trembled!

However, she quickly came back to her senses. She immediately turned around and shouted, “Qin Yu, I know you’ve never liked me, but you don’t have to frame me like this! Aren’t you going too far!”

Zhuo Jing also walked forward and said, “Let her go quickly. I’m annoyed whenever I see her now.”

Qin Yu glanced at Zhuo Jing, then looked coldly at Li Yingying and said, “I’m warning you. It’s best if you don’t let me know that you have a relationship with the northern lands. Otherwise, I absolutely won’t let you go.”

Li Yingying snorted coldly. She didn’t say anything and turned around to leave.

After she walked far away, Zhuo Jing said in a deep voice, “Brother Qin, do you really think that she has the internal Qi of the northern lands on her body?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No, I’m just guessing. The last time, Si Ma bei was nearby. I’m not sure if she has anything to do with Si Ma bei.”

“But didn’t you already kill Si Ma bei at that time?”Zhuo Jing asked doubtfully.

Qin Yu said coldly, “Don’t forget who exposed the position where I broke through.”

Zhuo Jing didn’t say anything more, but he seemed to be a little sad.

Qin Yu understood him. After all, the two of them were old acquaintances.

“Let’s not talk about this. Come, let’s drink,”Zhuo Jing pulled Qin Yu and said.

The two of them came to the pavilion and sat down. The usually lively pavilion was now deserted.

Qin Yu asked casually, “No one has come recently, right?”

Zhuo Jing said with a wry smile, “Under such circumstances, everyone wants to protect themselves. There’s no time to spare.”

Qin Yu nodded to show that he understood.

“Speaking of which, you’re in the limelight now. I’m afraid your fame is not much worse than the three mad and three deadly ones,”Zhuo Jing said half-jokingly and half-seriously.

Qin Yu sighed and said, “Don’t joke about me.”

“I’m not joking. That big battle was really dangerous.”Zhuo Jing sighed.

Qin Yu did not continue this topic. He looked at Zhuo Jing and said, “Brother Zhuo, do you know the East Wilderness?”

“East Wilderness?”Zhuo Jing was stunned and then said, “I do know it, but... it seems to be a desert. No one has been there for many years.”

Qin Yu hummed in gratitude. Qin Yu trusted Zhuo Jing 100% , so he did not hide it. He immediately told Zhuo Jing what had happened.

After Zhuo Jing heard it, he said in surprise, “You mean... that was the birthplace of the great cultivator who transcended tribulation?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “It can be said that the eastern wastelands alone have produced no less than ten great cultivators at the Tribulation Stage.”

Zhuo Jing touched his chin and muttered, “Now that you mention it, I suddenly remembered that my father had been to the east barren before he died, but he didn’t gain much...”

“Your father has also been to the East Barren?”Qin Yu asked in surprise.

Zhuo jing nodded and said, “It seems that the sect master of the Tianyun sect told my father this news, and... I once suspected that he was taking the opportunity to get rid of my father.”

Having said that, Zhuo Jing looked at Qin Yu and said in a deep voice, “Qin Yu, aren’t you afraid that he is lying to you? Is he trying to trick you into sending you to your death?”

“That shouldn’t be the case.”Qin Yu shook his head.

“With his means, he doesn’t need to waste so much strength to kill me. Moreover, I’ve read the records in the book.”

Zhuo Jing said with a wry smile, “Then, have you ever thought that he was the one who wrote the book? Did he tell you all this?”

“Besides, wouldn’t it be better if he didn’t have to kill you himself? Who knows if he’s Afraid of your background? People are evil.”

After hearing what Zhuo Jing said, Qin Yu started to mumble.

However, he remembered what Xiao Sheng had said, and it didn’t seem like he was lying.

“I still decided to go,”Qin Yu said after thinking for a while.

Zhuo Jing thought for a moment and then said, “Alright, I’ll go with you.”

“Really? But you don’t suspect him...”Qin Yu was a little surprised.

“I’m just suspecting him. Besides, my father has been there. I want to walk the path he once walked,”said Zhuo Jing.

Qin Yu nodded and said with a smile, “That’s great. There’s no time to lose. We’ll set off immediately.”

“Why are you in such a hurry?”Zhuo Jing asked in surprise.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “We don’t have time to waste.”

“Then wait for me for a while. I’ll Go and prepare,”Zhuo Jing said.

Qin Yu nodded. He sat in the pavilion and waited for Zhuo Jing.

Half an hour later, Zhuo Jing walked over.

“Let’s go,”Zhuo Jing said.

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude. The two of them didn’t waste any time and set off on the same day, heading towards the east barren.

The east barren was a long journey, and with their speed, it would take them several days.

“Sigh, it would be great if there was a spatial formation.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

Speaking of which, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little curious.

“Why hasn’t the formation of the Heavenly Cloud sect been activated? Back when I came to the holy region, I used this formation. It’s much more difficult than teleportation in the Holy Region,”Qin Yu said in puzzlement.

“The formation of the Tianyun sect has always been a mystery. No one knows when it will be activated, and no one knows exactly how it will be activated,”Zhuo Jing said.

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude. It was likely that the formation of the Tianyun sect was flawed. Otherwise, Xiao Hai would not have risked his life to cross the river of death.

The two continued to move forward, passing through the high sky.

They were getting closer and closer to the East Wilderness. At this moment, a figure blocked their path.

He stood in front of the Divine Eagle. His figure was not strong, but it was full of pressure.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He strode forward and asked coldly, “Who are you? Why are you blocking our way?”

The other party’s face was covered by the secret technique, so he could not be seen. His entire body was emitting a faint light.

“Are you going to the East Barren?”The other party asked.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, then said, “What does it have to do with you?”

“Did the sect master of the Tianyun sect ask you to go?”The other party continued to ask.

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly. He narrowed his eyes and said, “Who exactly are you?”

The other party did not answer this question. Instead, he said coldly, “I came to tell you not to go to the East Wilderness. Once you go to the East Wilderness... you will definitely die!”

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed!
