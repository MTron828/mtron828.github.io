Chapter 1591: Chapter 1,592, the strange inner core 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Looking at the skin on his arm, Qin Yu said in surprise, “Is it poisonous?”

He shook his arm, and a trace of fear appeared in his eyes.

Qin Yu’s body was indestructible, but if he encountered such a poisonous creature, he would easily fall.

Facing this demonic beast, Qin Yu didn’t dare to be the slightest bit negligent.

His body emitted an intense internal QI, shattering all the falling rocks in the surroundings.

Not Far Away, the demonic beast was coldly looking at Qin Yu. Its two fangs flickered with an ice-cold radiance in the darkness.

“Golden Light!”Qin Yu roared, his entire body emitting a golden light as he charged towards the demonic beast!

“Roar!”

The Demonic Beast roared angrily, and a terrifying sound wave immediately approached! Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

This sound wave actually went straight for Qin Yu’s divine sense, and even Qin Yu couldn’t help but be stunned.

Taking advantage of this moment of being stunned, the demonic beast instantly pounced towards Qin Yu, and its huge tusks headed straight for Qin Yu’s neck!

“Dang!”

Two tusks that were like steel blades fiercely stabbed towards Qin Yu’s neck, emitting a sound like steel colliding.

The demonic beast’s fangs were shaken until they were in pain, but only two white spots were left on Qin Yu’s neck.

“Roar!”

The demonic beast seemed to have been angered by Qin Yu. It raised its head and let out an angry roar, slapping its huge palm fiercely at Qin Yu!

Qin Yu immediately clenched his fist and faced the enormous Beast Claw!

“Boom!”

At the instant of the collision, beams of light swept out in all directions, directly shattering the cave!

Qin Yu could not help but take a few steps back, but the Demonic Beast’s claw was directly penetrated by Qin Yu, revealing a ghastly white bone!

“It seems that the Demonic Beast’s strength is not that strong.”Qin Yu thought in his heart.

With Qin Yu’s current strength, as long as he did not meet anyone at the reversion void stage, he was not afraid of anyone.

And the most powerful physical strength of the demonic beast was also somewhat insignificant in front of Qin Yu.

“Shua!”

At this moment, the Demonic Beast’s eyes emitted two beams of light once again, heading straight for Qin Yu’s head.

Qin Yu did not dare to be negligent. He hurriedly activated the line word formula and shot backward, dodging the two beams of light.

“Other than the two beams of light shooting out from its eyes, it seems that it is very difficult for it to hurt me,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Ever since the battle with the two godly monarchs, Qin Yu’s strength had increased once again. Now, facing this demonic beast, it seemed effortless.

He did not waste any more time. His entire body emitted a blazing golden light as he used his physical body to force the demonic beast forward!

The hair on the demonic beast’s body instantly burst out like poisonous needles, emitting a dark radiance.

This radiance had something in common with the radiance emitted from his eyes. The moment he touched it, Qin Yu felt an intense burning sensation!

“It is indeed poisonous!”Qin Yu stroked his injured arm and said in a low voice.

“It seems that if I want to kill this beast, I can’t get close to it.”Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly.

His mind immediately moved and he raised both his hands. A golden mark was aimed directly at the demonic beast!

It was unknown whether this demonic beast had not experienced a great battle for a long time or its divine sense was too weak. It did not Dodge Qin Yu’s mark at all. Instead, it opened its bloody mouth and faced it head-on.

“Boom!”

The Mark smashed onto its body, instantly knocking it to the ground, blood dripping everywhere!

This was a mark that Qin Yu had casually formed, but its power could be said to be endless. Every move and every move of his seemed to resonate with the Great Dao.

The connection of spiritual power allowed Qin Yu to do as he pleased. In just an instant, Qin Yu had already punched out hundreds of times.

Even though the demonic beast had an unparalleled physical body, it was still pushed back by Qin Yu. Its body was covered in blood.

It let out a miserable and unwilling roar. The young man in front of it caused it to feel intense fear.

However, Qin Yu was no longer a person of compassion. There was no trace of compassion in his eyes. Every palm was aimed at the vital points of the demonic beast.

Golden Light illuminated the heaven and earth. Qin Yu was like an undefeatable war god. His fist flickered with an ice-cold and dazzling light, as if it was about to shatter the heaven and earth!

The surrounding caves rumbled. It was unknown how many sleeping demonic beast were on the verge of awakening.

Qin Yu knew that he could not continue fighting at this moment. He had mastered the Great Dao and reached the ultimate fusion with his physical body.

As Qin Yu’s palm struck out, the laws of heaven and earth seemed to fuse together at this moment.

That palm seemed to come from the horizon, vast and mighty, as if it was about to sweep over everything in the world.

The entire demonic cave could feel this extremely powerful will. That aura caused all the demonic beasts to feel an urge to worship and worship! This was the internal Qi of the Demonic Beast!

“Boom!”

Finally, under the Demonic Beast’s terrified eyes, this palm suddenly descended.

The entire land seemed to have caved in by a few degrees, and a hundred thousand feet of dust soared into the sky, obscuring one’s vision!

Qin Yu felt the Great Dao during the great battle. Spiritual power rose from his heart, and its power was boundless.

The dust slowly fell. In the huge Palm imprint, a demonic beast that was like a fierce tiger was on the verge of death. Its internal Qi had already been exhausted to the extreme.

Qin Yu stepped on the void and slowly landed in front of the demonic beast.

In the Demonic Beast’s eyes, there was a trace of despair and pain.

It kept panting, as if it was begging for mercy.

Qin Yu sighed slightly. He raised his hand and gently placed it on its neck.

With a “Ka Ba”sound, the Demonic Beast’s pain also came to an end.

This was the only thing Qin Yu could do. Looking at this demonic beast that had lost its life, Qin Yu’s heart didn’t feel good.

“For the sake of the southern region, I can only sacrifice you,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

He stretched out his hand that was like a blade and tore open the demonic beast’s abdomen. From its body, he took out the inner core.

This was a dark green inner core. It emitted waves of extremely unique aura.

Qin Yu put it on his nose and sniffed. He couldn’t help but exclaim, “This inner core... is actually poisonous?”

The Poison on the Demonic Beast’s body was probably because of this inner core.

“Rumor has it that after refining the Demonic Beast’s inner core, one can obtain a portion of the common ability. I wonder if it’s true or false...”Qin Yu played with this inner core and thought to himself.

He didn’t know what kind of effect refining this inner core would bring, but it was worth affirming that the effect of this inner core would definitely far surpass that of an ordinary inner core.

No wonder ye Nan asked me to look for this inner core. It seems that he already knew that this inner core is different from an ordinary inner core, Qin Yu thought to himself.

Qin Yu didn’t stay any longer. He put away this inner core and turned around to leave the demon den.

All the way back to the Ye family’s grotto-heaven, Qin Yu passed through the alley and walked quickly to Ye Nan.

“Senior Ye, I brought back the thing you wanted.”Qin Yu flipped his palm and took out this inner core.

Ye nan said in surprise, “You really killed that demonic beast?”

Qin Yu nodded and asked impatiently, “According to Yue Ning, you can follow me to the northern border now, right?”
