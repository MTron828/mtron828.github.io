Chapter 1196: Chapter 1,196, looking for information about their mother 

They all turned around and looked at he teng, seemingly agreeing with He Teng’s words.

He Teng put his hands behind his back, he said indifferently, “There were thirty spots last time, who can guarantee how many there will be next time? Don’t you want to seize the opportunity in your own hands? At this time, don’t you know how to Huddle together to keep warm?”

The many mighty figures were silent, as if they felt that he teng’s words were somewhat reasonable.

“What do you want to Do?”Someone asked.

He Teng said coldly, “In the current era, the few of us can sweep through everything in the world! No One is our match! As long as we raise our arms and wave them, what does Heaven Gate count for?”

“Hehe, you aren’t using us to let you rise to the top yourself, right?”A mighty figure sneered.

He Teng waved his hand and said, “Everything I’ve done is for the sake of stepping into the holy region. If we were to establish a sect, we would definitely treat each other as equals and control the sect together.”

Everyone seemed to be somewhat moved.

They had been waiting for this opportunity for too many years. Just as they were about to step into the Holy Region, Qin Yu beat them to it.

“Alright, tell me what you want to do.”Someone compromised.

He Teng nodded in satisfaction and said, “From tomorrow onwards, we will establish a new sect. I will send people to guard the eighteen array platforms. As long as someone crosses the void and comes, we will be the first to know the news.”

“As for the specific time, I will inform you again. Please wait patiently.”

Seeing that there was no need to pay anything, the many mighty figures nodded and agreed.

After they left, that hoarse voice rang out in He Teng’s mind.

“Are you trying to enter the Holy Region, or are you trying to take the opportunity to satisfy the emptiness in your heart?”That voice was slightly mocking.

He Teng’s expression changed, and he said coldly, “Shut Up!”

“Hehe... the feeling of being suppressed under someone’s feet for a long time isn’t good, right...”

“Seeing Qin Yu leave, do you also want to have the world’s number one addiction?”

“There really is no tiger in the mountain, a monkey calls itself king...”

These few words made he Teng’s face turn red.

Since the two of them shared the same body, they could naturally read each other’s thoughts.

He Teng could not help but clench his teeth and coldly said, “So what if it is, so what if it isn’t!”

“An undeserved reputation can make you so crazy... Hehe, how inferior are you in your heart...”that ridicule was not concealed at all.

He teng sneered, “Yes, but you still know too little.”

“Before I leave Earth, I want to reap a wave of harvest! I want to use all of my resources to the maximum!”

“Do you really think I want to bring them to the holy region? Dream On! When the secret technique of the Sky Blood Rainbow is completed, I will absorb them all!”

He Teng’s face was full of viciousness. His state of mind had long been somewhat abnormal.

...

At night.

Qin Yu waited for a long time at ye Qing’s house.

At the same time, Ye Qing took the document and returned home.

He was not surprised by Qin Yu’s appearance. Instead, he walked to the opposite side of Qin Yu and silently lit a cigarette.

Then, ye Qing threw a document to Qin Yu and said, “This is the most information we can find.”

Qin Yu hurriedly took the document and opened it anxiously.

The document was very thick. It recorded the basic information of that woman, including her low birth point and life experience.

Qin Yu stared at the document closely, afraid of missing a word.

According to the information on the document, his mother’s name was Yu Keyun, and her occupation was a doctor.

Because she practiced medicine to save lives and heal the injured, she was given a nickname, Jade Bodhisattva.

“Jade Bodhisattva...”Qin Yu whispered the name.

“Yes, that’s right. According to our investigation, this Yu Keyun has a very good reputation in the local area. I don’t know how many poor people’s lives he saved,”ye Qing nodded and said.

Qin Yu didn’t say a word. He suddenly understood the origin of his name.

Didn’t he take his father’s and mother’s surnames to get his name?

“This way, it’s easier to investigate,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

He continued reading and found out that his mother lived in a small mountain village at the border.

That place was just right at the border of the isolated country, so it also caused great chaos in the mountain village.

Qin Yu put away the document and said, “Thank you, Commander Ye.”

Ye Qing said in a deep voice, “Qin Yu, what does this woman have to do with you? According to what we know, she suddenly disappeared more than 30 years ago.”

Hearing that, Qin Yu hurriedly said, “Commander Ye, can you help me investigate how she disappeared?”

Hearing that, Ye Qing immediately frowned.

He shook his head and said, “This may be more difficult. First, it’s relatively remote there, which makes it difficult for us to collect information.”

“Second, it’s because that place borders the neighboring countries. People go missing almost every day. After all, it was more than 30 years ago. Many things are not easy to deal with.”

Qin Yu said with some sincerity, “I know, but... this woman is very important to me. Please help me.”

“Very important? Qin Yu, tell me the truth. Who Is She to you?”Ye Qing asked.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment and said, “She is my mother.”

A trace of surprise flashed across ye Qing’s face. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

He took a puff of his cigarette and nodded. “Alright, I’ll agree to it. But I can’t guarantee that I’ll be able to find out.”

“Yes, I’ll set off for this mountain village tomorrow and investigate in depth,”said Qin Yu.

Ye Qing said in a deep voice, “Qin Yu, the terrain there is more sensitive. You... Don’t be too rash in doing things.”

“Don’t worry,”Qin Yu replied.

After thanking ye Qing again, Qin Yu took advantage of the night to leave.

The next day, Qin Yu set off early and rushed towards the mountain village.

The mountain village was called Rainbow Village and was quite far away from Jingdu.

It took Qin Yu nearly an entire day to reach the vicinity of Rainbow Village.

This place was indeed extremely remote. It was surrounded by a dense forest and the entire village was in a Yin gathering pit.

According to the scene Qin Yu saw in Inkstone, his mother was taken away by a few black-robed men.

This was enough to prove that the person who took her away was definitely not an ordinary person.

After Qin Yu arrived at Rainbow Village, he did not waste any time. He immediately began to go door to door to ask, but unfortunately, he did not receive any news.

After all, it had already been thirty years. Even though his mother was quite famous back then, she had long been forgotten.

Just as Qin Yu was about to give up, a woman in her fifties found Qin Yu.

“You’re looking for Bodhisattva Jade? I might know something about her,”said the woman.

Hearing this, Qin Yu hurriedly asked, “Aunt, is what you said true?”

The aunt nodded and said, “Yes, I know someone who has a good relationship with her. In modern times, she is Bodhisattva Jade’s best friend.”

Qin Yu hurriedly cupped his hands and said, “Please take me to see her. Thank you very much.”
