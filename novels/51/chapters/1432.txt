Chapter 1433: Chapter 1433, First Elder’s action 1

Qin Yu shoved the inner core to fang fang and said, “In a few days, I’ll bring you to the hunter organization.”

Fang Fang regained his senses and hurriedly nodded. “Okay, okay.”

Not far away, Mo Rong’s friends were nervously looking at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu glanced at them and said, “It has nothing to do with you. Don’t worry, I Won’t do anything to you.”

Hearing this, the few of them turned around and left without looking back.

Qin Yu didn’t waste any more time. He walked to the flying spider and squatted down, ready to take out the life Qi in his body.

Wisps of life Qi were circulating on the flying spider’s body.

He didn’t know where this flying spider came from, but it actually had life Qi in its body.

Qin Yu took out the jade bottle that brother Fu had given him and carefully collected the life qi.

Soon, all the life Qi in the flying spider’s body was absorbed into the jade bottle.

“Phew, this should be the last time.”Qin Yu took a deep breath and suppressed the excitement in his heart.

Following that, Qin Yu put away the jade bottle. His eyes scanned the surroundings as if he wanted to see if the hand of death had appeared.

Under the gaze of the desolate God’s eye, Qin Yu saw quite a number of demonic beasts, but he did not see the hand of death.

“This is really strange,”Qin Yu muttered to himself.

This did not make sense. Could it be that the flying spider and the hand of death had something in common?

Qin Yu did not continue thinking. He turned around and looked at Fang Fang and the rest.

“Let’s go,”Qin Yu said.

Fang Fang hurriedly nodded. They followed behind Qin Yu and did not dare to say a word.

“You... Are You Really Qin Yu?”Fang Fang asked in a low voice after a long while.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Why? Don’t you think I don’t look like him?”

“That’s not it. I just didn’t expect that a legendary figure would appear by my side,”Fang Fang sighed.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh bitterly.

The legendary figure? was he worthy?

“In a few days, I’ll bring you to the Hunter Organization.”Qin Yu patted Fang Ya’s shoulder.

Fang ya nodded and said, “Then thank you very much... by the way, aren’t you afraid that they will tell the Heavenly Cloud sect about your whereabouts?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I’m not afraid. This place is very far from the Heavenly Cloud sect. Even if they go to report it, it will take a few days.”

And a few days was enough for Qin Yu to recover his spiritual power.

At that time, even if the great elder came, Qin Yu would not be afraid at all.

After walking out of the Qingyan Forest, Qin Yu did not have anywhere to go for a while.

He did not know what kind of process it would take to recover his spiritual power, and Qin Yu was not confident.

Therefore, he had to find an absolutely safe place.

After thinking about it, he either went to the divine capital city or to Mount Hua Ning.

Therefore, Qin Yu looked at Fangya and said, “In a few days, you will still be here, right?”

Fangya nodded and said, “Yes, we will basically go hunting in the green rock forest every day.”

“Okay,”Qin Yu agreed. “I will come and look for you in a few days.”

He wanted to leave a token for Fangya and the others, but Qin Yu didn’t have any spirit energy in his body. Even if he left a token, it would be useless.

Therefore, after bidding farewell to Fang Fang and the others, Qin Yu left.

Then, Qin Yu rushed toward the divine capital. This place was relatively close to the divine capital, so Qin Yu would need about three days to get there.

Meanwhile, in the Heavenly Cloud sect.

There were two huge pillars in front of the first elder.

There was a chain in the middle of the pillars, and a few people were hanging on the chain.

These people were none other than Zhen Yue and the others.

“First Elder, please let them go...”Di Zun kneeled in front of the first elder and pleaded.

The first elder was unmoved. He looked at Di Zun coldly and said through gritted teeth, “If the sect master didn’t say before he went into seclusion that he couldn’t kill you, you would have the same fate as them.”

Then, the great elder stood up and walked to Zhen Yue and the others.

With his hands behind his back, he looked up at them and said coldly, “Qin Yu hasn’t shown up yet, so I can only sacrifice you.”

“As long as he doesn’t show up, I will kill someone until he shows up.”

After saying that, his eyes fell on Zhen Yue.

Among these people, the one with the weakest talent was undoubtedly Zhen Yue. Therefore, the first elder planned to kill her.

He pointed his finger at Zhen Yue with a light light and rushed toward her.

At this moment, Di Zun gritted his teeth and waved his sleeve. A light instantly shattered the first Elder’s spell!

The first elder’s face suddenly changed. He turned to look at Di zun and said coldly, “Do you want to die? !”

Di Zun glared at the great elder and said, “Either you kill me, or I will never let you touch a single finger of theirs!”

The Great Elder’s face turned ashen. He suppressed his anger and said, “Don’t think that I really don’t dare to kill you!”

Di zun said coldly, “Then come.”

The great elder narrowed his eyes, he said, “You are really a traitor. You are in the Heavenly Cloud Sect, but your heart is still with Qin Yu, right? Let me tell you, even if I kill you, the sect master will at most punish me! And you will lose your life! You better think it through!”DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎
