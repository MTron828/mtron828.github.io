Chapter 1347: Chapter 1,347, Wen Wanye 

Qin Yu stayed at the Wen family for the next few days.

He accompanied Juewu to go shopping all day, and he really became her cushion.

But Juewu looked too young, like a child, so Qin Yu didn’t feel too much psychological pressure.

Three days passed in a row.

On the fourth day, Wen Wanye, who hadn’t shown up, finally came back from the outside.

“Damn it, I’m actually late.”Wen Wanli cursed as soon as he entered the door.

Wen Da and Wen Er came up with smiles and said proudly, “Grandpa, we agreed that those who came back late would have to give one million spirit coins to the other party.”

With that, the two made the gesture of counting money.

“Damn it!”Wen Wanli cursed. Although he was extremely unwilling, he still gave the two one million spirit coins.

At this moment, Qin Yu and Jue Wu walked in from outside.

As soon as they entered, jue wu shouted, “Old Wen!”

Wen Wanye was stunned and hurriedly turned to look at Jue Wu.

He changed his expression and said with a smile, “It’s Jue Wu. Why are you here?”

Jue Wu jumped down from Qin Yu’s shoulder. She raised her head and said, “Why can’t I Come? Don’t You Welcome Me?”

“Of course not. I miss you day and night,”Wen Wanyun said with a bit of doubt.

Hearing this, Jue Wu suddenly jumped up and grabbed Wen Wanyun’s beard.

Wen Wanyun was an extremely huge old man, more than two meters tall.

And Jue Wu was only about 1.4 meters or 1.5 meters. When she jumped up and grabbed Wen Wanyun’s beard, she could almost swing on the swing.

“If you miss me, why don’t you go to Mount Hua Ning to find me?”Jue Wu asked while pulling Wen Wanyi’s beard.

“Aiyo, hurry up and let go...”Wen wanyi covered his beard. He looked extremely painful.

“I won’t Let Go!”Jue Wu snorted.

Qin Yu was dumbfounded.

These two peerless powerhouses were actually smiling like two children. They completely subverted the image of the powerhouses in Qin Yu’s heart.

“Hurry up and get out!”Wen Da pulled Qin Yu and walked out dejectedly.

“Hu, the person my grandfather most doesn’t want to see is Jue Wu.”Wen Da patted his chest and said.

“Yes, yes.”Wen Er also nodded and said.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “Looks like your grandfather and Jue Wu are very familiar.”

“Of course, we have been friends for many years.”Wen Da waved his hand and said.

Qin Yu suddenly understood. No wonder the Heavenly Cloud sect didn’t want to offend Wen Wanli.

If Jue Wu and Wen Wanli joined forces, the Heavenly Cloud sect might not be able to do anything about it.

Qin Yu, Wen Da, and the rest were drinking in the manor. It was only in the evening that Wen Wanli called them to the restaurant.

The long table in the restaurant was already filled with delicacies. Wen Wanli was sitting at the side with a gloomy expression.

His gaze landed on Qin Yu and he asked coldly, “Are you the Qin Yu Who Killed Ling Yun?”

Qin Yu immediately cupped his hands and said, “Greetings, senior Wen.”

Wen Wanli nodded his head in admiration and said, “Not bad, you’re quite capable. I heard that you killed Ling Yun in front of the first elder?”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “Yes, it’s also because of this that the heavenly cloud sect is desperately looking for me.”

“What... What’s there to be afraid of... ugh...”Jue Wu mumbled as she stuffed food into her mouth.

“You’re my meat cushion. The Heavenly Cloud Sect... won’t dare to do anything to you...”

Wen Wanli also nodded slightly and said, “As long as you’re with me, the Heavenly Cloud sect shouldn’t come looking for trouble.”

Qin Yu acknowledged and said, “Then thank you very much, senior.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Wen Wanli sized up Qin Yu again and then asked, “No spiritual power? Crippled Body?”

“No, I was poisoned by the Twilight Qi,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

As soon as he said this, Wen Wanli’s eyes immediately lit up, but it only lasted for a moment.

“So, you can’t use your spiritual power because of the Twilight Qi?”Wen Wanli said expressionlessly.

He looked calm on the surface, but in his heart, he was overjoyed.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “But my twilight qi poison is different from ordinary people.”

Then, Qin Yu told Wen Wanli in detail what had happened.

Wen Wanli was calm on the surface, but in his heart, he had made up his mind.

In the entire Wen family, Wen Wanli only had two grandsons, and he didn’t even have a personal disciple.

And these two grandsons weren’t interested in cultivation at all. Wen Wanji was just wondering who he should pass on his mantle to. Wasn’t Qin Yu in front of him the best choice?

“Alright, let’s eat.”Wen Wanji said expressionlessly.

After eating, Wen Wanji wiped his mouth and stood up. “Qin Yu, accompany me for a walk.”

“Okay.”Qin Yu didn’t think much. He just had a few questions he wanted to ask, so he followed Wen Wanji out.

The two of them walked in the Wen family manor. Wen wanji asked, “Qin Yu, what do you think of my two grandsons?”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “Although Wen Da and Wen Er don’t look decent, they are quite kind-hearted. I think they are quite good.”

Wen wanji coughed and said, “Ordinary cultivators shouldn’t look at such people.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I don’t think so. Everyone makes different choices. There’s no way to say who’s right and who’s wrong.”

Wen Wanji became happier the more he heard. His heart was blooming with joy.

He suddenly stopped and looked down at Qin Yu with a serious face.

“Qin Yu, are you willing to take me as your master?”Wen Wanji said with a serious face.
