Chapter 1682: Chapter 1682, the arrival of the Golden Age 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu and Zhuo Jing walked on the streets of the divine capital. Looking at the bustling divine capital, Zhuo Jing couldn’t help but sigh with emotion.

This place had turned into a paradise. The structure of the entire city was the same as the world of ordinary people.

“What do you plan to do if someone pretends to be you?”Zhuo Jing asked.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I can’t be bothered. Perhaps he wants to use my name to intimidate others. I’m only here to find a quiet place to cultivate.”

Zhuo Jing thought for a moment and seemed to think that it made sense, so he didn’t continue asking.

Then, Zhuo Jing followed Qin Yu to a back mountain.

This place was uninhabited, and it was extremely large. At a glance, it looked like a desert, somewhat similar to the eastern wastelands.

“I’ll enter seclusion here,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Having said that, he directly took out the dragon blood can, intending to try to break through to the middle stage of the mighty figure realm.

As for Zhuo Jing, he had no way to directly consume the dragon blood, so he could only try to dilute the dragon blood first.

Qin Yu took out a drop of blood from the can and dripped it on his finger.

Looking at this drop of blood, Qin Yu couldn’t help but think of the pain he had felt previously.

“Phew.”

Even for someone as determined as Qin Yu, he still felt some fear and fear in his heart. That kind of pain was not something an ordinary person could endure.

After mentally preparing himself, Qin Yu swallowed the drop of dragon blood into his stomach.

The pain from before came again. Qin Yu lay on the ground and rolled around non-stop. His entire body had turned blood red!

Seeing this scene, Zhuo Jing could not help but be shocked. He tried to ask, “Qin Yu, are you… Okay?”

Qin Yu said with difficulty, “I’m… Okay…”

No one knew how many times he would have to endure such pain. As for how long it would take, no one knew.

Zhuo Jing could not help but sigh, “This kid really can endure it for the sake of cultivation…”

For the rest of the time, Qin Yu continuously consumed the dragon blood.

It was not as painful as before. The pain caused by consuming the dragon blood was simply impossible to adapt to. Every time, the pain was extremely intense.

After Zhuo Jing absorbed the blood, he also began to try to swallow and break through.

In the blink of an eye, a month had passed since the last big battle with the elementalists.

The border between the northern and southern regions was also getting closer and closer. It seemed that the death river would disappear at any moment.

At the northern border, Sima bei watched everything quietly with his hands behind his back.

“The Death River is going to disappear in the end,”Sima bei lamented.

He had a faint sense of anticipation in his heart. During this period of time, the Snowy Mountains in the northern region had been moving from time to time. Moreover, the snowy mountains were emitting an extremely strong internal Qi.

The strength of this internal Qi shocked Sima bei greatly. Just a wisp of it was enough to kill an ordinary mighty realm cultivator!

It was precisely because of this reason that Sima bei was looking forward to the moment when the elementalists were fully resurrected.

“The resurrection of the Lord is probably even more powerful than Xiao Sheng.”

After sensing the internal Qi of the elementalists, Sima Bei speculated.

Such strength was probably enough to sweep across the entire Li Province!

In this way, the things that Xiao Sheng failed to accomplish back then could probably be accomplished by the elementalists!

If the Li Province was really unified, his status as a godly king would naturally rise along with it!

“Let’s wait. It Won’t be long before this world will change.”Sima bei sneered.

…

Tianyun sect.

After wandering around for a few days, Xiao Sheng finally returned to the sect.

The deputy sect master hurriedly told Xiao Sheng about Qin Yu.

“Sect master, Qin Yu seems to have something very important to tell you.”Sima bei said.

Hearing this, Xiao Sheng was first startled, then a smile appeared on his face.

“He came?”Xiao Sheng asked.

The deputy sect master scratched his head and nodded, “Sect master, I just finished…”

Xiao Sheng did not say anything, but the smile on his face grew wider.

“This Qin Yu really has some ability,”Xiao Sheng thought to himself.

Immediately after, Xiao Sheng did not say anything and turned around to enter the cultivation mountain.

Time flew by.

In the blink of an eye, half a year had passed.

During this half a year, the southern region had also welcomed an unprecedented peace.

Perhaps it was because of the harassment of the northern lands, which had led to the unprecedented unity of the southern region. The previous internal conflicts had also been quietly resolved.

On this day.

A sky-piercing radiance suddenly lit up somewhere in the Southern Region!

A pillar of light pierced straight into the clouds, and a strange phenomenon appeared in the sky!

This scene immediately attracted the attention of countless people, and they were all astonished.

“This is… someone has broken through?”

“This strange phenomenon seems to be a sign of the heavenly tribulation.”

“Looking in that direction, it seems to come from the wind bamboo mountain. Could it be that Qu Zhu has broken through?”

A few days later, another strange phenomenon occurred in the southern region. Dark clouds appeared in the sky. Clearly, someone was about to break through.

In the next few days, a strange phenomenon would appear from time to time in the southern region. In a short span of ten days, at least a dozen dazzling lights would appear in the entire southern region!

“This is really strange. When did the southern region have so many top-notch martial artist?”

“Other than the three maniacs and three ultimate martial artists, who else could break through in such a short period of time?”

“From this strange phenomenon, the strength of the person who broke through is obviously very strong. Could it be that there is some reclusive mighty figure in the Southern Region?”

For a moment, the entire South Province was discussing this matter and speculating.

In the Heavenly Cloud Sect, the vice sect leader had already sent people out to scout for news.

The news that he obtained had indeed shocked the vice sect leader greatly.

Because the phenomenon in the sky was indeed the sign of a breakthrough, and every single one of them was extremely powerful!

Among them, the weakest one had stepped into the peak of the mighty figure in one go, and there were even people who had stepped into the half-step void return!

This was an unprecedented grand occasion. One had to know that the southern region had been silent for too many years. It had been a long time since anyone had broken through.

However, in these few short days, these people had all appeared like bamboo shoots after a rain. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“I have to report this to the sect leader,”the deputy sect leader said in a low voice.

After saying this, he prepared to head to the Cultivation Mountain.

However, when he turned around, he discovered that the sect leader had already walked in.

The deputy sect leader hurriedly cupped his hands and bowed. Then, he impatiently told Xiao Sheng about this matter.

“Sect leader, what exactly is going on? It seems like they’ve already discussed it. They’ve all broken through in the past few days.”The deputy sect leader frowned.

Xiao Sheng was not surprised. He sat on the wooden chair and took a sip of tea. Then, he said, “When the great world descended, many people who were stuck at a certain realm benefited from this great world.”

The deputy sect leader was stunned. Then, he said, “You mean…”

“That’s right. The golden great world has really arrived,”Xiao Sheng said slowly.

This was a rumor that no one had ever confirmed. However, the breakthroughs of the cultivators over the past few days indicated that the golden great world had officially arrived.

“It’s finally here…”Xiao Sheng murmured in a low voice, as if he had been waiting for many years.
