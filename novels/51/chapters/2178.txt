2179 The First Heavenly Tribulation

The demons’ roars became increasingly shrill, and the lightning in the dark clouds became even more violent as if it wanted to destroy everything.

However, Qin Yu did not cower due to this. Instead, there was a flicker of determination in his eyes. He knew if he wanted to step into the True Saint Realm, he had to face all kinds of tests and challenges.

He stood up, his body straight and firm. He stepped into the void as if he had become a solid mountain confronting the terrifying sky.

Qin Yu stared at the demons and dark clouds in the sky, feeling the infiltration of malice and death internal qi. The battle intent in his heart burned like an indestructible sword.

“Rumble…”

At this moment, the scene in the sky changed again. Dark lightning mixed in the dark clouds, and the lightning seemed to have fused with the demons in the dark clouds, becoming even more powerful!

“The first heavenly tribulation is finally coming,” Qin Yu said coldly.

As Qin Yu finished speaking, the dark clouds in the sky began to fuse with the demons, forming a powerful force. The dark lightning rumbled in the dark cloud, releasing terrifying energy fluctuations.

This energy fluctuation became increasingly vast, like a monstrous wave that swept over. The entire sky was shrouded in darkness, with dark clouds covering it and endless fear permeating the air.

Qin Yu stood in the void with a determined gaze. An unparalleled power surged from his body. He was fearless as he welcomed this powerful heavenly tribulation.

In the middle of the sky, a massive vortex formed. Dark clouds and lightning spun within it and created an enormous vortex storm. The storm emitted a demonic internal qi that was suffocating.

The dark vortex in the storm gradually expanded, devouring all light and hope like an endless abyss.

Qin Yu took a deep breath, and his body began to shimmer with a dazzling light. His true essence surged, forming patterns of light that resembled a fire dragon coiling around his body.

He slowly raised his palm and gathered a massive amount of energy. A ball of light gradually formed in the center of his palm, emitting a dazzling radiance.

This ball of light contained Qin Yu’s power and was his weapon to resist the heavenly tribulation.

Qin Yu’s gaze was firm. He stretched out his hand and threw the ball of light into the dark vortex.

“Rumble!”

The sky instantly shook violently, and the dark vortex erupted with a powerful energy impact, colliding violently with the light ball that Qin Yu had thrown into it.

The two powerful forces clashed against each other, resulting in an explosion. Energy fluctuations swept out like a volcanic eruption, and the entire void trembled.

In this violent collision, Qin Yu felt an enormous pressure going to crush him.

However, he did not back off. The battle intent in his heart became even more determined. He condensed his true essence and circulated every inch of his body’s strength to fight against the heavenly tribulation.

He kept releasing powerful attacks, using his strength to attack the dark vortex, trying to tear it apart.

The darkness in the vortex and lightning burst forth with violent power, surging toward Qin Yu, attempting to devour him.

However, Qin Yu relied on his own cultivation, determination, and his desire to reach the True Saint Realm, to resist this powerful pressure. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The light on his body grew even brighter. Every attack carried destructive power, tearing the dark vortex apart.

Enormous cracks appeared in the vortex, and light seeped into them.

Qin Yu’s power grew even stronger, and his attacks became even fiercer, suppressing the power of the heavenly tribulation to the extreme.

In the end, the dark vortex collapsed and became countless fragments that dissipated in the void.

“This first heavenly tribulation is nothing great,” Qin Yu sneered and said.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s heart surged with invincible battle intent and confidence. He was unafraid of these nine heavenly tribulations at all!

Nonetheless, Qin Yu did not dare to be negligent. He knew this heavenly tribulation was not ordinary, and every heavenly tribulation was increasingly terrifying

He thus adjusted his internal qi and waited for the second heavenly tribulation to descend.

The demons’ roars echoed in the sky, and the lightning in the dark clouds became even more violent as if it wanted to destroy everything.

Qin Yu stood in the void with a determined gaze. A powerful force surged from his body. He was ready to welcome the arrival of the second heavenly tribulation.

Suddenly, the sky changed again. A tremendously hot flame emerged from the dark cloud and fused with the lightning, forming a terrifying fire lightning.

Fire lightning raged in the sky, releasing a destructive power. It burned all life and turned everything into ashes.

Qin Yu’s eyes expression was solemn. He knew this fire-lightning heavenly tribulation was even more terrifying than the previous one. He dared not be negligent. He quickly adjusted his condition and prepared to face this challenge.

The fire lightning attacked Qin Yu fiercely, and the speed was unimaginable. It emitted a scorching internal qi as if it could burn everything to ashes.

Qin Yu’s eyes flashed with a hint of determination. He condensed his true essence, formed a seal with his hands, and cast a powerful defensive spell.

A layer of indestructible golden light surged out from his body!

This light resembled an indestructible fortress, emitting a powerful protective force that firmly protected Qin Yu within.

Coupled with Wu Ji’s divine robe on Qin Yu’s body, his physical body reached an indestructible level!

The fire lightning struck, colliding with Qin Yu’s defensive light, erupting with dazzling light.

The power of the fire and lightning surged like a violent storm, attempting to break through Qin Yu’s defense and completely engulf him.

However, Qin Yu’s defense was indestructible and unwavering. He clenched his fists and gathered his strength to unleash a powerful attack.

Invisible energy waves burst out from Qin Yu’s body. The golden light seemed to be corporeal as it attacked the fire lightning.

The fire lightning gradually weakened under Qin Yu’s attack, but it still kept approaching him.

Qin Yu took a deep breath, his eyes flickering with determination.

He knew that only by going all out could he defeat this terrifying fire-lightning heavenly tribulation.

Qin Yu released his most powerful attack without hesitation, concentrating all his power into one point, forming a terrifying energy torrent.

The golden torrent contained limitless destructive power and rushed toward the fire lightning at lightning speed.

The fire lightning collided with the energy torrent, and an earth-shattering power erupted!

The spatial rift expanded, flames flew everywhere, and energy shockwaves raged!

Qin Yu’s attacks became even fiercer. He non-stop released powerful strength with all his might!

“Ah!”

Following Qin Yu’s furious roar, his entire body completely turned into a golden color as hot as the sun! This golden light even tenaciously lit up in the depths of the void!

The fire lightning weakened under his attack and was finally completely defeated!

The sky regained its calm and peace, and the fire-lightning heavenly tribulation completely dissipated.

Standing in place, Qin Yu’s body slightly trembled as he felt the tremendous energy he had consumed.

He knew that although he had successfully withstood the second heavenly tribulation, seven more were waiting for him.
