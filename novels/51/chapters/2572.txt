Chapter 2573: Setting Up

Jue Chen snorted coldly and disappeared into the darkness again.

Even a mortal body would spend a portion of the Saint Kingdom’s power to condense. No Saint would easily give it up unless absolutely necessary.

“It seems that everyone is here. Since everyone has the divine flame mark, I have an immature idea that I’d like to discuss with all the Saints.”

Netherworld Ghost King chuckled eerily.

“Since it’s immature, then shut up.” Shen Xiao chuckled and said.

“There’s no harm in listening.”

Netherworld Ghost King chuckled eerily again. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“No one had thought that Chen Shuang would sacrifice his soul to lure these thousands of souls into his kingdom. There must be a backup plan for these thousands of souls. Even if we send other souls into his Saint Kingdom, it might still end up benefiting Chen Shuang.”

“What are you trying to say? Just say it out!”

Shen Xiao raised her eyebrows and coldly reprimanded.

“Naturally, we must make the best choice for ourselves by eradicating these seeds altogether. Even if each of us only gains a fraction of the Heart of Saint Kingdom of the Dao Enlightened Master, Chen Shuang, it will still bring ample benefits to our respective Saint Kingdom.”

Netherworld Ghost King enunciated each word deliberately.

Among the eighteen Saint Kingdoms, the number 81 was the number of the Heart of Saint Kingdom that had split from the Saint Kingdom.

As long as one could obtain these 81 Heart of Saint Kingdom, one could gain complete control over the Saint Kingdom.

It was not that Saints came before Saint Kingdom, but rather, Saint Kingdom came first, and from the 81 Hearts of Saint Kingdom that Saints emerged.

Ultimately, the Saints in the Primordial Chaos times were just living beings derived from the kingdom. They controlled the kingdom and became the Saints after they had the Heart of Saint Kingdom.

From Primordial Chaos, the Chaos Division, and then to the Supreme of Divine Land, this was the most glorious period for the entire human race.

The number of human race Immortal Emperor accounted for more than half. At that time, the Cage of the Path of Heaven had not yet formed.

Many human race living beings could break through other people’s worlds and come to the Saint’s world.

After that, they would enter the kingdom at a specific time and finally gather the Heart of Saint Kingdom to control the entire kingdom and become Saints. The Dao Enlightened Master Chen Shuang and Dao Saint Zi Yang were the same.

After the Era of Annihilation, there was a tacit understanding among the Saints. The eighteen Kingdoms of Saint joined forces to set up a cage.

It segregated all living beings from the Saint’s world. This way, they would not pose a threat to the masters of the eighteen Saint Kingdoms.

At this moment, other than the human race Saints, all the other Saint-Level living beings showed signs of agreement.

Even if they were to detonate all these divine flames and might lose their physical bodies in this mortal world, Netherworld Ghost King’s words made a lot of sense. If they could obtain some Heart of Saint Kingdom, the benefits for their advancement would be much greater than the functions of their physical bodies.

“Bullsh*t! Using our human race’s souls as a bargaining chip is really a good idea. If these living beings go up, at least the Dao Enlightened Master Chen Shuang’s kingdom still belongs to our human race Saint. What makes you think we’ll agree?”

Shen Xiao laughed coldly.

“It’s fine if you disagree. Why are you scolding me?”

Netherworld Ghost King let out a sharp laughter, a sound akin to glass

scraping late at night, sending a shiver down anyone who heard it.

For some reason, looking at the Netherworld Ghost King’s distorted face, Shen Xiao started to feel uneasy.

“Attack! ”

Netherworld Ghost King suddenly let out a sharp cry.

His body was like an exploded truck tire, emitting a loud noise.

Hundreds of malicious ghosts with distorted faces suddenly rushed out of the pores of his body.

What was terrifying was the internal qi of these malicious ghosts. Their internal qi had reached the fifth level, and at this moment, they were letting out shrill screams.

It tore the souls that were drifting toward the Kingdom of Saint. A Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect’s soul that had already fused with the divine flame screamed in fear.

“You’re the Carefree Wanderer, Yun Piao! Your soul has actually become a part of Netherworld Ghost King?”

“Xuanyuan, Mingyu! Look carefully! We’re not enemies!”

“Indestructible Battle Against Demon, you’re a senior of the human race. Why did you attack us?”

At this moment, the entire world was filled with miserable screams. Originally, these people’s souls were about to wither after their deaths.

However, the appearance of the divine flame had awakened their consciousness. Although they did not know where these divine flame marks would summon them, it was still better than death.

The sudden appearance of the Netherworld Ghost King made them struggle frantically. This feeling was like a drowning person grabbing onto a life-saving straw, and the straw broke.

Netherworld Ghost King let out a sharp laugh. His cultivation method was to devour the souls of the most formidable people and keep them in his body.

The most special thing was that these people would retain all their fighting instincts, and they might even be stronger than previously. However, the master of their souls would become the Netherworld Ghost King, and they would only follow the Netherworld Ghost King’s will unconditionally.

At this moment, his mortal body shrank by 70% to 80% as the fierce souls in his body were released. He enveloped twelve divine flames and fled into the distance.

“Boom!”

Carefree Wanderer Yun Piao tore apart the soul of a disciple of the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect and bit the divine flame that had already taken root.

“Boom!”

An earth-shattering explosion erupted, unleashing a massive shockwave.

One, two, three…

In an instant, the vast expanse of heaven and earth once again fell into a destructive explosion. At the same time, other than the Netherworld Ghost King and the human race, the other Saint-Level beings also attacked almost at the same time.

They seemed to have discussed it in secret.

The alien race at the Saint Level and the Netherworld Ghost King, who had already attacked, all attacked.

Zi Yang frowned slightly and also attacked suddenly. He had more than 20 divine flames in his hand, and at this moment, it was a good thing for him to destroy these marks.

The human race Saints were stunned. No one had expected such a change.

“D*mn it! Protect the seeds of the human race.’

Su Xinghe slashed out with his sword and blocked the attacks of the two Saint-Level demons.

Kunlun, Shen Xiao, and Buddhist Saint, the Saintly Lord of the Lamp, Ding

However, Revered Qi of the Qi family, Shadowless Divine Hand Jue Chen, and martial expert Lin Nantian, the three Saints didn’t make a move.

They took the divine flames they had obtained and quickly left this area.

The explosion of any divine flame could cause damage to the Saint-Level human body.

“You three are worse than pigs and dogs. Are you worthy of being the human race Saints?”

Shen Xiao was so angry that her body trembled. At this moment, those divine flames seemed also to feel the threat. They emitted a dazzling light and crossed the crystal wall that connected the two worlds at an even faster speed, teleporting toward the Dao Enlightened Master, Chen Shuang’s Saint Kingdom.

The three Saints did their best to protect nearly 200 souls, escorting them into the Saint’s world.

Almost in an instant, the area was blasted into nothingness by the exploding divine flames..
