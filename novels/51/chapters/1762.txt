1763 The Terrifying He Teng

Yuan Xiu glared at He Teng and said, “Where’s the White Bone Club? Isn’t that a quasi-Saint Weapon?”

“If you can activate that White Bone Club, you might be able to turn the tide!”

He Teng was enlightened. His palm shook, and the White Bone Club appeared.

He waved the White Bone Club and said thoughtfully, “You mean this? Well, if you didn’t remind me, I would have forgotten about this...”

“Trash!” Yuan Xiu spat out the word with difficulty.

He collapsed on the bed and said in a trembling voice, “I’ll leave the North Plain to you for the time being. After I’ve recovered, I’ll return to Nanzhou and kill them... ”

He Teng sneered.” Lord, do you still plan to go back? You’ve already failed so many times. Why do you want to repeat it?”

Yuan Xiu’s expression turned cold. He glared at He Teng and said,” What do you mean by that?”

“Me? What do you think I mean...” He Teng’s tone became extremely sinister.

Without waiting for Yuan Xiu to speak, He Teng suddenly activated the white White Bone Club!

He raised the white White Bone Club, and a terrifying power instantly gathered in it!

Yuan Xiu looked confused when the White Bone Club struck his head!

The White Bone Club in He Teng’s hand actually gave off a trace of Saint Power!

This wisp of Saint Power instantly smashed Yuan Xiu’s head into pieces!

“Of course I meant this,” He Teng said coldly.

“You took me as your dog? Yuan Xiu, who do you think you are?” He Teng said with a sinister look.

At that moment, a thread of divine sense floated out of Yuan Xiu’s mind.

This was Yuan Xiu’s incomplete primordial spirit! He glared at He Teng with a face full of disbelief.

“You actually dare to betray me?” Yuan Xiu roared in anger.

“Oh? No wonder you became the Lord of the North Plain. You’re still alive,” He Teng said with a cold smile.

Yuan Xiu opened his mouth and was about to speak, but He Teng did not give him the chance.

He immediately activated the White Bone Club and used the last trace of the Holy Power to erase Yuan Xiu’s divine sense!

The Lord of the North Plain died in He Teng’s hands!

He Teng held the White Bone Club with one hand as drops of blood flowed down the club.

“I’ve never treated you as my master, so how could I have betrayed you?” He Teng sneered.

“He Teng! You’re so despicable. You... you actually killed the Lord!” At this moment, Sima Bei, who was lying on the bed, suddenly roared!

He glared at He Teng and gritted his teeth. “You’re despicable!”

He Teng glanced at him and immediately hit him with the club.

This strike smashed Sima Bei’s head and primordial spirit into pieces!

“I’m not like you, willing to be someone’s minion for the rest of your life,” He Teng said coldly.

In the blink of an eye, Yuan Xiu and Sima Bei had both died at He Teng’s hands.

No one would have thought that Yuan Xiu, who had managed to flee back to the North Plain, would end up like this!

Yong Ji looked at He Teng and didn’t say a word, but he couldn’t help but feel scared.

He Teng looked at Yong Ji with a half smile and said indifferently, “Don’t worry. I won’t kill you.”

When Yong Ji heard this, he was relieved.

He suppressed the fear in his heart and said, “Thank... thanks a lot.”

He Teng sat down by Yong Ji’s bed and said indifferently, “A true man will not stay low for long.”

“I’ve always thought you were scary,” Yong Ji said with a bitter smile. “But I didn’t expect you to be this scary.”

“Oh?” He Teng’s brows rose, signaling for Yong Ji to continue.

“I’ve always thought of myself as a shameless person,” Yong Ji said. “In order to achieve my goals, I can sacrifice anything!

“But ever since I met you, I realized that you’re even more ruthless than I.”

“Hahahahahaha!” Hearing this, He Teng raised his head and laughed!

The laughter was so ear-piercing that it stirred up a storm in the entire North Plain!

“Then why do you think I came here?” He Teng asked.

“Inheritance? The Immortal Slaying Sect’s inheritance?” Yong Ji asked after some thought.

“Not bad!” He Teng looked a bit crazy.

He suddenly stood up and shouted, “I know very well that I don’t have a strong background. I don’t have an inborn bloodline. I don’t have great luck! I can only rely on myself!

“Since I’m not given an opportunity, I’ll create it for myself!

“Inheritance... I’ll get it by myself!”

Hearing He Teng’s words, Yong Ji was deeply touched.

He recalled He Teng’s words back in the Divine Capital City. Back then, Yong Ji had not believed him. However, at this moment, he began to believe He Teng’s words.

“If you want to live, then obediently stay here,” He Teng said indifferently.

“I won’t stay here for long. I’ll leave after I get what I want.”

After saying this, He Teng turned around and was about to leave.

At this moment, Yong Ji called out to He Teng.

“Why didn’t you kill me?” He asked, frowning.

He Teng’s brows raised as he said indifferently, “I’ve said it before. I don’t need a reason to kill a person, and I don’t need a reason to let a person go, either.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

After saying this, he turned and walked out of the room.

His figure disappeared into the heavy snow.

...

Yuan Xiu was dead.

No one in Nanzhou knew about this.

At this moment, Qin Yu was lying on the bed, half-dead.

No one could feel good after getting two severe injuries in a row.

“This kid won’t die, will he?” Wen Wanchong, who was sitting by Qin Yu’s bed, whispered.

Jue Wu glared at him and scolded, “Shut your doomsday mouth!”

Wen Wanchong chuckled and did not dare to say anything more.

Jue Wu tried to transfer some internal qi into Qin Yu, but unfortunately, she failed.

“Let’s go to the Medicinal Saint City and find a pharmacist for Qin Yu.” Qu Zhu suggested.

Jue Wu coldly snorted and said, “Those people in the Medicinal Saint City are just a bunch of good-for-nothings. What’s the point of looking for them?”

“Then what’s your plan?” Qu Zhu asked with a frown.

Jue Wu thought for a while and said, “I’ll go to Zhongzhou and find a pharmacist for Qin Yu. Anyway, the dead river has disappeared.”

“Even without the dead river, Lizhou is surrounded by the Azure Stone Forest,” Qu Zhu said with a frown.

“Anyway, I have to try.” Jue Wu glanced at Qin Yu, who was lying on the bed.

“This kid saved my life, so I have to save him, no matter how dangerous it is,” Jue Wu said in a low voice.

At this time, Wen Wanchong came over and smiled. “Lady Jue Wu, it’s not realistic to go to Zhongzhou. Even if you are lucky enough to walk out of the Azure Stone Forest, you won’t make it back in time. By the time you come back, I’m afraid this kid would have already become a corpse.”
