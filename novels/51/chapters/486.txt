Chapter 487: Pavilion Master and Gu Canghai Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The news that the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion had been taken away quickly spread.

“The Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion actually lost. What a pity.”

“According to what I know, eight half-step Martial Marquises besieged the Divine Alchemist Pavilion that day!”

“The Pavilion Master fought against eight people by herself and never made any killing moves. Otherwise, it would be hard to say who would win and who would lose.”

“Not only that, but I heard that the Pavilion Master seemed to have been poisoned, so she was unable to display half of her peak strength.”

“I really didn’t expect that the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, with such a wide network of connections, wouldn’t even have a single person to come to the rescue when something happened.”

Everyone discussed animatedly while expressing their pity for the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

But they all understood that the stronger the person, the higher their status.

And the higher the status, the more they valued benefits. In their eyes, there was no emotion to speak of.

In the Saint Confucian Sect, the Pavilion Master didn’t know how long had passed before she slowly woke up.

She was locked in the Saint Confucian Sect’s dungeon, and her surroundings were pitch black.

But the Pavilion Master’s expression was strangely calm, and not a trace of panic could be seen.

At this moment, a sound came from outside.

She saw Elder Qu tiptoeing in.

“You’re awake?” Seeing the Pavilion Master, who had awoken, Elder Qu couldn’t help but sneer.

“Hehe, weren’t you very proud? Why have you become a prisoner now?” Elder Qu leaned forward while mocking her incessantly.

The Pavilion Master glanced at Elder Qu and said indifferently, “You came in alone? Are you courting death?”

Elder Qu was stunned. Just as he was about to speak, his entire body was sent flying!

“Bang!”

Elder Qu’s body was fiercely smashed onto the wall behind him.

A mouthful of blood flowed out from the corner of his mouth.

Elder Qu didn’t even see clearly when and how the Pavilion Master attacked.

“Even if I become a prisoner,I’m not someone a good-for-nothing like you can touch.” The Pavilion Master said indifferently.

Elder Qu wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and said with a bit of anger, “What are you so arrogant for? As long as I give the order, I can let you die in this cage!”

At this point, Elder Qu licked his lips and said with a perverted look, “I heard that you’re still a virgin, right? Wait until I beat you up, then you can enjoy your first time!”

The Pavilion Master’s expression turned cold and she said coldly, “Do you want to die?”

“Hahaha, what can you do to me?” Elder Qu sneered.

At this moment, the door opened again.

A tall man in a white robe walked in.

Seeing this man, Elder Qu hurriedly greeted respectfully, “Greetings, sect master.”

The sect master waved his hand and said, “You can leave first.”

After sending Elder Qu away, sect master Gu Canghai walked to the front of the Pavilion Master.

“Ji Yuhong, long time no see,” Gu Canghai said indifferently.

Ji Yuhong?

Gu Canghai actually called out the Pavilion Master’s name?

The Pavilion Master glanced at Gu Canghai and said indifferently, “It seems that you still remember the grudge from back then.”

Gu Canghai’s face immediately flashed with a trace of anger.

He glared at the Pavilion Master and roared, “Ji Yuhong! If it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t have ended up like this! Because of you, I can’t even have my own children!”

Ji Yuhong said indifferently, “It’s your fault for being so useless.”

“Useless?!” Gu Canghai immediately sneered.

“I’m a Martial Marquis now!”

“And you’re a prisoner!”

Ji Yuhong wasn’t angry. She raised her eyebrows and said, “Do you think I have no chance to become a Martial Marquis?”

Gu Canghai was stunned. He frowned and asked, “What do you mean?”

Ji Yuhong said indifferently, “I don’t need to explain to you.”

The Pavilion Master’s attitude clearly angered Gu Canghai.

“You’re already a prisoner, yet you still dare to be so arrogant!” Gu Canghai clenched his fist and said.

“I want to see how long you can be arrogant for!”

Ji Yuhong smiled nonchalantly and said, “Okay, I also want to see when you can have your own child.”

Gu Canghai’s body stiffened, and then he snorted coldly.

He looked at the guard next to him and said, “From today on, you’re not allowed to give her a mouthful of food or a mouthful of water!”

“Yes!” The two guards shouted.

...

Time flew by. In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

Qin Yu had gone into seclusion for a total of twenty-seven days.

There were only three days left until a month would pass.

During these few days, the First Elder had taken over the Divine Alchemist Pavilion and announced to the public that he was the new Pavilion Master.

Not only that, but he had called back all the pharmacists who were originally on break!

On the square of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, the First Elder had his hands behind his back and was in high spirits.

Below him were dozens of alchemists from the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

“From today onwards, I will be the new Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion,” the First Elder said nonchalantly.

There was silence below and no one spoke.

The First Elder said with some displeasure, “Why, didn’t you hear it? Do you need me to say it again?”

“First Elder, you have already betrayed the Pavilion Master. Why are you standing here and claiming to be the new Pavilion Master?”

“That’s right, we only acknowledge the Pavilion Master!”

The First Elder’s face was livid as he said coldly, “Without Ji Yuhong, does the Divine Alchemist Pavilion not exist anymore?”

“The Divine Alchemist Pavilion was created by the Pavilion Master herself. It must not fall into the hands of a traitor like you!” Someone below shouted.

The First Elder immediately flew into a rage!

He immediately raised his hand and slapped out!

“Crack!”

With this slap, the head of the alchemist instantly exploded like a watermelon!

The First Elder swept his gaze across the crowd and said coldly, “Who else is unconvinced?!”

There was complete silence below. No one dared to say a word.

“First Elder, I apply to withdraw from the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.” At this moment, a young man stood out.

He fiercely threw the token on his waist onto the ground. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“I’ll withdraw too!”

“I’ll withdraw too!”

For a moment, almost all the alchemists took out their tokens and smashed them into pieces!

First Elder was so angry that his entire body was trembling. He suddenly shouted in anger, “If anyone dares to withdraw, I’ll kill them!”

“What, we don’t even have the right to withdraw?” Someone below angrily rebuked.

First Elder looked at him coldly and narrowed his eyes as he said, “I think you want to die!”

Light flickered in the First Elder’s palm as streams of killing intent burst forth.

“Everyone, please listen to the First Elder’s arrangements.”

At this moment, the Fifth Elder walked out.

He swept his gaze over everyone and said in a deep voice, “Everyone, don’t be rash. Please listen to First Elder’s words.”

“The establishment of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion wasn’t easy. It’s such a pity for it to disband like that.” The Fifth Elder sighed.

The people below were filled with anger. They berated, “Fifth Elder, you actually want to be a traitor too?”

“You’re really a spineless thing!”

“What? You’re sucking up to him since he has the power now?!”

Everyone condemned the Fifth Elder one after another.

The Fifth Elder smiled bitterly.

He subconsciously looked in the direction of the warehouse and whispered, “There are only three days left. If we can hold on for another three days, Qin Yu will come out of seclusion...”
