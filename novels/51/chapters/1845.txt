1846 The Tong Family’s Secret Technique

Qin Yu’s words immediately made everyone burst into laughter.

One of them took a step forward and said with a cold face, “Qin Yu, do you know what you’ve just said? You’re going to the Tong family? Do you think you have the strength to go against the Tong family? Do you know what kind of existence the Tong family has?”

“Of course, I don’t know. So I hope you can tell me.” Qin Yu said expressionlessly.

“You want me to tell you? You think I’ll tell you?” The long-bearded cultivator laughed non-stop.

“Trust me. You’ll tell me,” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said.

After saying that, Qin Yu walked forward step by step.

With every step he took, Qin Yu’s internal qi became denser.

When Qin Yu arrived at the city wall, the whole city wall could not hold on anymore. It kept shaking and rumbling.

The few people standing on the city wall felt something wrong instantly. They hurriedly shook their feet and jumped into the air.

After sensing Qin Yu’s terrifying strength, these people’s faces revealed a trace of solemnity.

“This internal qi is so terrifying,” one of them said in a low voice.

“No need to talk nonsense. Let’s attack together and kill him. We’ll go back and ask for orders,” a person beside him said.

They looked at each other and stopped talking. Then, they all looked at Qin Yu unanimously.

Then their bodies emitted traces of strange internal qi.

This internal qi condensed into a huge picture in the air. In the picture was an enormous character, “Tong”.

It seemed to be a secret technique of the Tong family, which contained an extremely terrifying divine might.

Every wisp of internal qi emitted from the picture made the surrounding people retreat. Some people couldn’t withstand it and turned into blood mist on the spot.

Looking coldly at the enormous character “Tong”, a trace of ridicule appeared on Qi Yu’s face.

He raised his palm, and in an instant, Golden Light shone brightly. A golden radiance gathered on his arm. And the radiance flowed toward his palm like a trickle.

“Qin Yu, if you’re sensible, come with us now. Maybe you’ll have a chance to survive. Otherwise, don’t blame us for being impolite!” the long-bearded elder shouted.

Qin Yu’s expression was cold, and he ignored him.

The golden radiance from his palm was like a rising sun. When he clenched his fist, all the energy in his palm seemed to be about to explode!

The power of the Reversion Void Stage was truly on display at this moment!

Qin Yu didn’t use fancy techniques but only that simple and terrifying Golden Fist!

With a roar, Qin Yu threw his fist into the air!

This punch was indeed destructive. It shattered everything!

Tianyun Sect’s city walls could not withstand the terrifying power and began to shatter in an instant!

The golden fist smashed directly into the mysterious picture suspended in the air. The moment they collided, the picture began to tremble, and the enormous character in the picture emitted an extremely strong internal qi!

Although this internal qi was not comparable to Holy Power, it was still beyond the Reversion Void Stage. However, even this terrifying Tong family’s technique exploded after withstanding it for a while!

The enormous character “Tong” turned into countless fragments and shot out in all directions irregularly.

It seemed to be a sign of something. It was a sign of the Tong family’s future.

The few people who had activated the picture together were instantly forced back. They took a few steps back and stabilized their postures with tremendous difficulty. One of them even spat out a mouthful of blood!

They had grave expressions, while the surrounding crowd of onlookers was even more shocked.

Qin Yu had shattered the Tong family’s secret skill with one punch. His strength was obviously beyond everyone’s imagination!

At this moment, Qin Yu was like an undefeatable God of War. His conviction to win moved everyone.

“The chaotic body of the Reversion To Void Stage is indeed worthy of its reputation,” the long-bearded old man said coldly.

Qin Yu squinted his eyes and sneered.

This old man actually knew about Qin Yu’s physique. It seemed that he couldn’t enter Zhongzhou in a low-profile manner. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Alright.” Qin Yu’s face suddenly showed a trace of relief.

However, this trace of emotion disappeared instantly, and it turned into an unspeakable coldness.

“I’ll use your Tong family as a declaration of my arrival at Zhongzhou,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Everyone was shocked when they heard this!

Qin Yu wanted to use the Tong family as a stepping stone to enter Zhongzhou. He was indeed too arrogant!

Although the Tong family wasn’t a first-class aristocratic family in Zhongzhou, it was still well known.

Since the emergence of the Tong family, when did others ever look down on them?

Not to mention Qin Yu, even the aristocratic families of the Zhongzhou would not dare to say such arrogant words!

“He’s indeed a fanatic,” the long-bearded elder narrowed his eyes.

He then took a step forward, sneered, and said, “So what if you have a chaotic body? Do you think you’re Si Shiyue?”

Hearing the name of Si Shiyue, Qin Yu sneered even more.

“Alright. Then I’ll let you see who’s stronger between Si Shiyue and me,” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said.

Seeing that he could no longer hide the fact about his physique, Qin Yu did not want to waste any more time talking to him.

The internal qi on his body began to erupt at this moment!

A powerful internal qi gathered in his body. The golden radiance was extremely dazzling. It was as if it was competing with the sun and the moon. That terrifying sense of oppression, with Qin Yu as the center, quickly spread to the surroundings!

The powerful internal qi emitted from his body alone was enough to shatter everything in the surroundings!

As for the long-bearded elder and the others, their faces flickered with a terrifying expression.

“Si Shiyue killed an Advanced-stage Reversion Void cultivator as an Early-stage Reversion Void Stage cultivator. I’ll kill the six of you today,” Qin Yu said coldly.

These words seemed to be contesting Si Shiyue, and everyone was shocked!

Si Shiyue was a true heaven’s favorite. In the entire Holy Region, she was also a top-tier existence!

It was no exaggeration to say that he was an extremely dazzling star among the younger generation. It was only a matter of time before he reached the Tribulation Stage!

Today, Qin Yu compared himself to Si Shiyue. In everyone’s eyes, it was an extremely arrogant thing to do!

“You, arrogant fool! How dare you compare yourself to Young Master Si? Let me teach you how to behave!” the long-bearded elder took a step forward and shouted continuously.

He raised his right hand and displayed a terrifying dao technique. Lines of extremely mysterious patterns interweaved in his palm.

He seemed to be displaying some kind of terrifying dao techniques. All kinds of holy light were dancing, and his left hand was sliding quickly, emitting strands of clear light.

Following that, with a crisp sound, a terrifying celestial sword appeared in his hand!
