Chapter 1061: Chapter 1,060, supreme sand 

When he saw the soul bell, Zhai Xing’s expression instantly turned extremely ugly!

He stared fixedly at the soul bell in Qin Yu’s hand and stretched out his hand, wanting to snatch it back.

But right now, Zhai Xing was incomparably weak, so how could he be Qin Yu’s match! !

Qin Yu’s hand shook slightly, and he dodged Zhai Xing’s palm.

“How could the soul bell be in your hand!”Zhai Xing said somewhat angrily.

Qin Yu lied and said, “When I put it back, I realized that someone would ambush you on the way, so I followed you in the dark until you returned to the martial arts association in Jingdu.

“I killed those two people and took the soul bell back. If I activate the Soul Bell, do you think you will be afraid of Gu Zi’s five-petal lotus

“Also, if I take out the soul bell, do you think you can survive

“The reason why I haven’t used the soul bell and would rather use my body to resist the five-petal lotus is still unclear to you!”

“Are you really going to force me to use the soul bell and sacrifice everyone to kill Gu Zizhen?”

“Also, let me tell you, if the battle continues, Gu Zizhen will definitely lose!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“You know better than me what Gu Xinghe has done. Right now, everyone has long detested the martial arts association of Jingdu.”

“And Chang Mang and the others are about to step into the martial saint realm. At that time, the second secret realm will only get weaker and weaker!”

Zhai Xing’s expression was extremely ugly.

He stared blankly at Qin Yu, his heart greatly shaken.

Qin Yu, on the other hand, remained silent. He could not help but think to himself, ‘damn it, I’m so eloquent.’

He was not in a hurry. Instead, he let Zhai Xing think for himself.

During this time, Qin Yu also secretly paid attention to the big battle outside

Immortal Crane’s strength lived up to its reputation. In the face of Gu Zizhen, he was not at a disadvantage at all. In fact, he was even sure to win.

Under the premise that Gu Zizhen did not use the five-petal lotus, he was not a match for immortal crane at all.

“What do you want?”

Finally, Zhai Xing spoke.

Qin Yu could not help but let out a long sigh of relief in his heart.

Damn it, he was finally fooled!

Qin Yu turned around and said in a deep voice, “I don’t want to kill too many people, so I only ask you to ask the martial artists of the second mystic realm not to participate in the battle, in case I accidentally kill them all.”

Zhai xing grunted and said, “And then?”

“Gu Zizhen and I will fight one-on-one,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“Life and death are determined by fate, and wealth and honor are determined by heaven. I just don’t want to implicate innocent people.”

These words undoubtedly spoke into Zhai Xing’s heart.

He clenched his teeth and said, “Okay, I’ll agree to it. But you have to give me some time.”

“How long?”Qin Yu suppressed the excitement in his heart and pretended to be calm as he said.

“Three days,”Zhai Xing said.

“Okay, I promise you.”Qin Yu nodded and said.

“I’ll take my people and leave the second mystic realm now. Otherwise, if we continue fighting, who knows how many people will die because of this.”

With that, Qin Yu turned around and left.

Zhai Xing watched Qin Yu’s back as he left, his heart filled with mixed feelings.

Qin Yu walked out of Zhai Xing’s room with quick steps. He returned to the battlefield and used his divine sense to send a voice transmission to immortal crane.

“Alright, we can retreat now,”Qin Yu said.

After immortal crane received this signal, it immediately shot backward.

Its original body was immortal crane, and its speed was far above Gu Zizhen’s.

In almost an instant, the two of them pulled away from each other.

“Everyone, Retreat,”the immortal crane said coldly.

After saying that, it took the lead to rush toward the exit.

Everyone fled out of the second secret realm one after another. When Gu Zizhen caught up to the exit, he stopped in his tracks.

“Why isn’t that Qin Yu Here? I still want to teach him a lesson!”Xuan qi shouted.

Gu Zizhen looked at Xuan Qi coldly and said, “Do you want to beat him up again when he comes?”

Xuan Qi was instantly silenced and his old face turned red.

“Qin Yu was injured by the five-petal Lotus. I’m afraid it will take some time for him to recover,”gu Zizhen said coldly.

“This is also the reason why I didn’t use the five-petal Lotus.”

Xuan Qi said unwillingly, “Master, are you going to let them come and go as they please again and again?”

“Or what?”Gu Zizhen’s face was cold.

The initiative was not in the second secret realm. Even Zhai Xing was defeated. No one in the second secret realm could kill Qin Yu.

“As long as he appears again, I will kill him!”Gu Zizhen said coldly.

...

On the other side, Qin Yu and the others had already fled back to the Heaven Gate.

“How is it?”Zhai Xing asked.

Qin Yu said with some pride, “With my eloquence, of course it’s not a problem!”

“Zhai Xing has agreed. I will give him three days. After three days, I will go to the second mystic realm to fight Gu Zizhen. I can use these three days to think about how to deal with the five-petal Lotus.”

“Aren’t you afraid that he will lie to You?”Immortal Crane asked in a deep voice.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “With Zhai Xing’s character, he probably won’t.”

“Qin Yu is right. Zhai Xing’s heart is extremely simple. He can be considered a pure martial artist.”Jiang he nodded and said.

However, immortal crane said coldly, “Humans have complicated temperaments and are incomparably treacherous. I never believe in your promises.”

At this point, Immortal Crane looked at Qin Yu and said, “In three days, I’ll go to the second mystic realm with you.”

Qin Yu wanted to say something, but was interrupted by the crane.

“Alright then.”Seeing this, Qin Yu could only nod and agree.

In the next few days, auspicious clouds lit up in the sky again.

Clearly, someone had stepped into the martial saint realm.

Qin Yu did not have the heart to care about these things. All his thoughts were focused on how to deal with the five-petal Lotus.

The next day.

Qin Yu was about to head to Jingdu’s martial arts association’s Pavilion of Internal Qi to find a countermeasure when he suddenly felt a wretched aura approaching.

“Handlebar mustache?”

Qin Yu did not even turn his head and guessed who it was.

The handlebar mustache muttered, “Damn it, I’ve already restrained my breath. How did you know it was me?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “You can restrain your breath, but you can’t restrain the wretched aura on your body.”

“F * ck you!”The mustached man couldn’t help but curse.

Qin Yu turned around and said, “What are you doing here?”

The mustached man heard this and said with a smile, “Haven’t you been attacking the second mystery land recently? This second mystery land must be a land of treasures. Where there are treasures, there are naturally places where the original body is not absent.”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “You didn’t appear during the big battle, but now you have jumped out.”

“Aiya, I’ve been busy all this time,”the mustached man said with a smile.

“It’s not impossible for you to go, but you have to help me.”

Qin Yu took out the five-petaled lotus fragment and handed it to the mustached man.

“You have to help me think of a way to deal with the five-petaled Lotus,”Qin Yu said.

After the mustached man took the five-petaled lotus, he exclaimed, “Is this supreme sand?”

“Supreme sand? What’s That?”Qin Yu asked in surprise.

The Mustache Man ignored him. He took the five-petaled lotus fragment and looked around, then muttered, “It really is supreme sand.”
