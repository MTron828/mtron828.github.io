Chapter 1113: Chapter 1,113, snatching away the strange flower! 

The surface of the sea stirred up a thousand layers of waves!

Yun Long’s figure burst out from within, sliding several hundred meters on the surface of the sea!

He only felt pain in his palm, as if he had become numb.

At this moment, Qin Yu was brimming with fighting spirit. He was completely different from when he was at the bottom of the sea, as if he was a god of War!

His hair danced wildly, and with a step forward, the waves of the sea seethed!

“Come, Yun Long, I’ll fight with you!”Qin Yu shouted.

Yun Long was naturally not convinced. He spat out a divine light from his mouth and transformed into twelve golden dragons that whistled towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s expression was ice-cold. Two large golden hands condensed in front of him. The palms brought with them an indestructible might as they crushed forward!

The Twelve Golden Dragons were directly shattered by Qin Yu’s palms and turned into golden light from a glass plate!

Qin Yu did not stop there. He stepped on the ‘xing’word formula and shot towards Yun Long. A fist that could break ten thousand arts had already condensed on his fist.

That Golden Fist was like a small sun that was about to explode! Even the void seemed to tremble!

Yun Long’s expression changed greatly. He could clearly feel the terrifying power contained in that fist!

At this moment, Yun long even felt a chill run down his spine!

His figure flashed, and he directly disappeared into the void, disappearing without a trace!

“Again?”Qin Yu’s expression was ice-cold.

“Do you really think I’m afraid of Your Spatial Arts? !”Qin Yu shouted loudly, and the entire space buzzed!

Qin Yu did not pry into the spatial arts. He was unable to capture Yun Long’s figure.

Yun long relied on this spell to silently kill countless people!

“Swoosh!”

A palm suddenly extended out from Qin Yu’s head!

It was extremely fast, and there was nowhere to hide!

Qin Yu’s pupils burst out with a blazing heat that was like flames as it headed straight for the palm!

This divine light pierced through Yun Long’s palm, but Yun Long’s palm also fiercely slapped onto Qin Yu’s head, causing Qin Yu’s head to Buzz!

Following that, Yun long quickly withdrew his palm.

Qin Yu coldly shouted, “Come out again, I will definitely kill you!”

After saying that, Qin Yu’s feet suddenly shook, and heavy falling space instantly spread out from under Qin Yu’s feet!

This was the only spatial spell Qin Yu controlled, but it had a miraculous effect!

Under the heavy falling space, Yun Long’s speed instantly slowed down by a lot!

When he attacked again, Qin Yu’s palm turned into a sharp blade, slashing towards Yun Long’s wrist!

“Chi la!”

The sharp blade slashed at Yun Long’s wrist, and his two palms instantly fell and exploded!

“Ah! !”

Yun Long’s painful voice came from the void!

His two palms were chopped off by Qin Yu. Although he could recover, it would take a lot of time!

“Without your palms, how can you defeat me? !”Qin Yu said coldly. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Qin Yu’s voice was like a clap of thunder that shook all directions.

“Come out and fight with me!”Qin Yu roared.

However, Yun Long had already lost his will to fight. He gritted his teeth and fled through the void!

Qin Yu stood there and shouted, but Yun Long did not show himself.

“It seems that he has run away,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Yun Long was only at the martial saint stage. As long as they were at the same stage, Qin Yu was not afraid of anyone.

Regardless of whether it was a special physique, demonic beasts, or some top-tier bloodline, Qin Yu was not afraid!

“If you still don’t come out, I will leave.”Qin Yu withdrew his sharp edge and said in a deep voice.

Seeing that Yun long still did not move, Qin Yu did not say anything more and immediately turned around to leave.

Without the boat, Qin Yu could only rely on walking.

He did not know how long he had been speeding on the surface of the sea, nor did he know the exact location.

In short, Qin Yu had counted days and nights. It had already been two whole days.

“Damn it, could it be that I have made a mistake in the direction?”Qin Yu thought to himself that things were not looking good.

With Qin Yu’s speed, he was much faster than that cruise ship.

But it had already been two days. There was no sign of the coast.

“No, I have to salvage a ship,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He continued to move forward. Fortunately, his hard work paid off. A warship finally appeared in Qin Yu’s sight.

What surprised Qin Yu was that there was a symbol carved on the ship.

This symbol was actually the symbol of the Hong Yi sect!

The huge “Hong”word was extremely eye-piercing.

“Hong... it should be the Hong Yi sect,”Qin Yu said with a cold smile.

Following that, Qin Yu’s feet shook, and he quickly approached the battleship.

With a leap, he landed on the battleship.

“You... Who Are You?”The moment they saw Qin Yu, the expressions of the people on the ship could not help but change.

Qin Yu did not answer this question. Instead, he asked, “Is this the ship of the Hong Yi Sect?”

“Since you know it’s a ship belonging to the Hong Yi sect, you still dare to barge in recklessly?”

At this moment, a young man walked out from inside.

He wore a purple robe and had his hands behind his back. He had the temperament of a superior.

Qin Yu looked at this young man coldly and said, “It really is the Hong Yi sect. If it were any other organization, I would really be embarrassed to snatch your ship.”

“Snatch a ship? Do You Want to Die?”The young man’s expression turned cold. Then, several burly men walked out from behind him.

These burly men were all at the Martial Marquis Realm and were extremely powerful!

And that young man was even a half-step martial saint! He was enough to look down upon all heroes!

“Martial marquis... as expected of the Hong Yi sect.”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

That young man laughed loudly and said, “Those who dare to provoke the Hong Yi sect will die! If you kneel down and beg for mercy now, it might still be possible!”

“Kneel down and beg for mercy? That’s not a bad idea.”Qin Yu raised his brows. In the next second, the pressure from his body was suddenly released!

A terrifying pressure spread towards the few of them.

Under this pressure, the expressions of these martial marquis instantly became extremely ugly!

His body trembled non-stop. The huge pressure caused their bodies to continuously bend.

“Kneel down!”

Qin Yu shouted. Finally, they could not bear it anymore and suddenly knelt on the ground!
