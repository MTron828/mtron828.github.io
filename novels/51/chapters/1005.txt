Chapter 1006: Chapter 1,006 was not over yet 

Xiang Danqing narrowed his eyes and sneered, “Your arrogant attitude is exactly the same as Ji Yuhong’s.”

Qin Yu could not help but feel a little wronged.

He had clearly kept a low profile, so why was he still called arrogant.

“Are you sure that the clear heart pill is okay?”Pavilion master asked.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “To me, any pill doesn’t really make much difference.”

The success of refining a pill depended on the strength of one’s divine sense, in addition to one’s skill in refining pills.

Qin Yu and Tie Dan’s training had already made their divine sense extremely powerful.

“Then let’s begin. Go to the mountain and pick the herbs yourself,”Xiang Danqing said coldly.

With that, he turned around and walked out.

“Let’s go,”pavilion master said to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude. He turned around and walked out of the valley with quick steps, all the way to the mountain of herbs.

The mountain was filled with herbs, and they were all growing extremely vigorously.

It was obvious that Xiang Danqing was an alchemy fanatic, and he was also extremely attentive to the planting of herbs.

Qin Yu picked a batch of herbs according to the pill formula needed for the clear heart pill.

To prevent accidents, Qin Yu compared the herbs in different regions many times to ensure that the medicinal effects were maximized.

This also caused Qin Yu to spend even more time.

By the time Qin Yu returned to the valley, Xiang Danqing had already prepared.

“What? Does it take so long to pick herbs?”Xiang Danqing could not help but say with some ridicule.

Qin Yu was not angry. He smiled and said, “When fighting with senior, of course I have to make more preparations.”

Xiang Danqing snorted coldly and said, “Since the herbs have been brought back, don’t waste time.”

With that said, he took the herbs and walked to the stone cauldron.

His internal energy shook, and layers of fragments appeared on the inside of the stone cauldron!

Then, Xiang Danqing waved his hand, and the fragments were all cleaned out.

“To ensure the medicinal efficacy, I will shatter a layer of skin after every pill refinement to prevent the medicinal herbs from escaping and affecting the medicinal efficacy,”Xiang Danqing said indifferently.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He took out the cauldron with the divine dragon engraved on it from the spatial divine tool.

Xiang Danqing’s pupils suddenly shrank when he saw this cauldron!

“You actually gave this cauldron to him!”Xiang Danqing said angrily.

Pavilion master said indifferently, “You lost to me, so it naturally belongs to me. No one can control who I want to give it to.”

“You!”Xiang Danqing couldn’t help but clench his teeth.

He said coldly, “Kid, I added a condition at the last minute.”

“Please speak, senior.”Qin Yu bowed and said.

Xiang Danqing said coldly, “If you lose, return this cauldron to me!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Okay.”Qin Yu agreed without thinking.

“Then let’s begin.”Xiang Danqing didn’t say anything more.

He threw the herbs into the cauldron, and then a purple-colored spiritual fire lit up in his palm!

“It really is a purple fire.”Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief when he saw this.

Xiang Danqing waved his hand, and the flames instantly fell into the stone cauldron!

Under his control, the flames seemed to dance.

Xiang Danqing’s control over the spiritual fire was extremely keen. The flames spread to almost every part of the herbs, and the medicinal effects were brought into full play.

Qin Yu did not waste any more time. He flipped his palm, and the same purple fire appeared in it.

Following that, Qin Yu used the same method and began to refine the herbs.

The two flames caused the temperature in the entire valley to soar.

Qin Yu relied on his powerful divine sense and focused all his attention on refining the pill.

“Chi la!”

At this moment, a sound came from within Xiang Danqing’s cauldron!

The herbs within the stone cauldron actually began to withdraw their juice!

“What a fast speed!”

Such speed caused even the pavilion master to be slightly stunned!

On the other hand, Qin Yu’s medicinal herbs had just begun to dissolve, and Wisps of medicinal juice had just flowed out.

“HMPH!”

Xiang Danqing lightly snorted, and with a loud shout, the stone cauldron immediately began to crackle with explosive sounds!

A burst of dense smoke erupted from within!

This was clearly a sign that the pill was about to be completed!

From refining to forming the pill, Xiang Danqing only spent less than an hour!

“What a fast speed!”Pavilion Master was secretly shocked!

“Ha!”

Xiang Danqing let out another Explosive Shout!

That purple flame instantly filled the entire stone cauldron!

A burst of sounds instantly came from within the stone cauldron! A rich medicinal fragrance assailed his nostrils!

Following that, Xiang Danqing put away the spiritual fire and walked straight to the front of the stone cauldron.

He extended his hand in and slowly began to search for the clear heart pill.

One Pill, two pills, three pills... a total of eighteen clear heart pills!

In such a short period of time, he had refined so many pills!

At this moment, even the pavilion master could not help but be greatly shocked!

“I remember that when you and I competed back then, you only refined sixteen pills,”Xiang Danqing said coldly.

“Now, I used even less time to refine 18 pills! Do you think your disciple can still win?”

Pavilion master smiled and said, “Xiang Danqing, it seems that you didn’t live in seclusion in vain all these years.”

Xiang Danqing sneered and said, “Of course! Not to mention your disciple, even you might not be my match!”

Pavilion master didn’t say anything and just looked at Qin Yu quietly.

At this moment, pavilion master was also faintly worried.

Qin Yu slightly closed his eyes and completely ignored Xiang Danqing.

Fortunately, the two of them were competing in quantity and not speed. Otherwise, Qin Yu would have lost miserably.

In the medicinal cauldron, the rich medicinal liquid was slowly taking shape.

The Purple Flame in Qin Yu’s hand also began to erupt!

“He’s finally about to form a pill.”Xiang Danqing snorted lightly.

“But with his method, he can at most form ten pills!”

Just as Xiang Danqing said.

Compared to Xiang Danqing, Qin Yu’s method was indeed much more immature.

“Ji Yuhong, you’re going to lose for sure!”Xiang Danqing sneered repeatedly.

“Boom!”

At this moment, the inside of Qin Yu’s medicinal cauldron also emitted waves of explosive sounds!

Xiang Danqing’s eyes immediately looked over.

“Have you finally formed the Pill?”Xiang Danqing couldn’t help but Snicker as he strode towards Qin Yu.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly waved his hand and said, “Senior, please wait a moment. It’s not over yet!”

“Oh?”Xiang Danqing glanced at the medicinal cauldron and said with a cold smile, “There are only nine clear heart pills in your cauldron. Other than that, there are remnants. Are you trying to stall for time?”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “Senior, please wait a moment. I’m not done yet.”

After saying that, Qin Yu closed his eyes.

A thread of golden light immediately flew out from between his brows!

This golden light transformed into the shape of Qin Yu. Then, it took a step and arrived in front of the cauldron!

“Eh? Divine Sense?”Seeing this scene, Xiang Danqing seemed to be somewhat puzzled.

Then, he saw that the divine sense and Qin Yu’s palm merged together!
