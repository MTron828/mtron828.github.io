Chapter 2705: The Nineteenth Prison

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“If I don’t go, what will be the consequences?”

Qin Yu’s body slowly tensed up. He had never heard of this place before.

If the woman in front of him did not dare to enter, it would be even more dangerous for him to go there.

The woman had just finished fighting the sandworm. If he wanted to escape, he might have a chance.

“Even if you don’t go, your divine soul will still be dragged into the Nineteenth Prison, just like those people you saw. Your divine soul is special. I can’t see through your secrets, but you can resist the power of the Nineteenth Prison. However, your strength is too low. There will be a moment when you will be exhausted. You should be able to feel it.’

The moment the woman finished speaking, Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically.

He had been feeling more and more tired as if there was a mountain pressing down on his divine soul.

According to what the woman said, it should be the Nineteenth Prison that she was talking about.

Xi Ming had said before that there seemed to be something on him.

All in all, this woman shouldn’t be lying.

“Can you let me understand all the information before I decide?”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“Alright, ask me if you have any questions.”

The woman nodded.

“Who are you?”

“Me? You can call me Meng Jing. I’m considered a native of this Saint Kingdom. My power is based on this kingdom, so I have to stop the destruction of the kingdom.”

Meng Jing explained briefly.

Qin Yu nodded slightly. His guess was right. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Previously, Meng Jing gave him a feeling similar to that of Teng Zixu and the others. It was a little like being born out of the world.

She belonged to this Saint Kingdom, so it was no wonder she had such terrifying power.

“Then what happened here? How did this happen?”

Qin Yu continued to ask.

“The power of Saint Kingdom has been drained and the order has collapsed. Someone took this opportunity to set up the Nineteenth Prison attraction formation, using the power of the Endless Mine as the formation energy to obtain the power of all the ores here.”

Meng Jing’s answer was simple, but Qin Yu was still at a loss.

“What does the Starry Sandworm have to do with this?”

“The Starry Sandworm was originally a creature of the universe. It shuttled through the space with the strongest energy, including the lower realm, the eighteen Saint Kingdoms, and even the Divine Realm. Wherever it passed, the energy would be nibbled away, and the energy would be exhausted. This spiritual species is also considered a must-kill item in the various Saint Kingdoms. The Starry Sandworm you saw just now is only a larva.”

Meng Jing explained this to Qin Yu in detail.

Qin Yu’s face was filled with shock. That huge creature just now was just a larva?

How large would the adult Starry Sandworm be? Would the entire Saint Kingdom’s energy be enough for it?

“Fortunately, it’s only a larva. I’m afraid I wouldn’t be a match for an adult sandworm. Now the Holy Lord of the Saint Kingdom has died and the power of the two Hearts of Saint Kingdom has been transferred. This is the time when the Saint Kingdom is at its weakest. The mastermind has perfectly grasped this timing. He must have planned this for a long time.”

Meng Jing said softly.

“Wait, I still have a question. What is the relationship between the Nineteenth

Prison Formation and the sandworm? I still don’t understand the connection.”

“The Starry Sandworm is extremely intelligent. It will only subconsciously move towards places with huge energy. Moreover, the only thing that runs through its divine sense is ‘eat’. In terms of energy swallowing, even the divine beast, Tao Tie, is not its match. You need to leave a mark in its divine soul to control it, which requires a huge amount of divine sense power.”

“There was once a monster race’s Holy Lord, Lucifer, who tried to leave a mark on an adult Starry Sandworm but suffered a backlash. It took him almost 2,000 years to recover. Lucifer was originally one of the top Holy Lords among the 18 Holy Lords, but his power was greatly reduced after that.”

Meng Jing said calmly.

“The Nineteenth Prison is a space that doesn’t belong to this world. It has another name, Yin Yang World.”

“Doesn’t belong to this world?”

Qin Yu did not understand.

“This world is in your head, or rather, in your dream. I believe you have encountered the Path of Dream before, which pulled you into a dream of a thousand years. That is only the outermost layer of the Nineteenth Prison. The core of the Nineteenth Prison is a place that you can never escape from. There is no way to reincarnate there. Even if your physical body dies, your soul will always wander there. It is the most terrifying hell.”

“A dream of a thousand years!”

Qin Yu suddenly thought of Jun Yixian, the scholar who had saved her several times.

Later on, he found out that Junn Yixian had also saved him from Satan. At this moment, he suddenly had a strange idea. If he went to the Nineteenth Prison, would he be able to meet his savior?

Qin Yu suddenly understood why those people’s internal qi were suppressed to the extreme.

Even if their heads were broken, they could still sense a weak life force.

It turned out that their divine souls had long entered the Nineteenth Prison.

He suddenly felt a chill run down his spine. Does this mean these people would never be able to return and they couldn’t even reincarnate?

However, he immediately came to his senses. Qin Yu frowned and asked. “If that’s the case, I won’t be able to return from the Nineteenth Prison.”

“The Nineteenth Prison’s attraction formation can only attract the edge of the space to this place. Furthermore, the person behind this is using the space as a guide to leave a mark on the Starry Sandworm’s divine soul. Currently, he is still unable to completely control this Starry Sandworm. If he continues to absorb the soul power of the Nineteenth Prison, I’m afraid that he will be in complete control of this sandworm very soon. At that time, no one in the Saint Kingdom could kill this thing. I’m afraid that the entire Saint Kingdom’s energy will be depleted.”

“Is that Buddha’s head portrait that divine soul mark?”

Qin Yu asked in a deep voice.

Meng Jing nodded slightly.

Qin Yu frowned and pondered. He finally understood the ins and outs of the matter.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s expression slightly changed. He only felt his divine soul emit a dull sound.

It felt like a child carrying the weight of an adult. At this moment, he was already beginning to feel the terrifying pressure.

This was probably the summoning power of the Nineteenth Prison that Meng Jing had mentioned. He was almost certain that what this woman had said was true.

If he continued to stay, his divine soul would be dragged into the Nineteenth Prison.

“What if I choose to leave?”

Qin Yu probed.

“Although the Nineteenth Prison is the deepest part of your sea of consciousness, this non-existent space is not that simple. The summoned space has completely covered the Endless Mine. Even I can’t leave here before the power dissipates. There’s a teleportation formation there. You can give it a try.”

The lady shook her head..
