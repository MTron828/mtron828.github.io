2262 The Path of Reincarnation

However, that strange phenomenon passed in an instant. Before Qin Yu could comprehend it, it had disappeared.

Qin Yu deeply sensed the mist within the clouds, and after a long time, another kind of divine sense technique flashed across.

The soul technique was much more complicated than the cultivation method of the body. Qin Yu had also fumbled for a long time before he had a clue about the Soul Torment Mind Technique back then, let alone this fleeting image that passed by in a flash.

With a flicker of thought, the desolate divine eye instantly appeared on Qin Yu’s forehead.

The mist slowly receded like a tide, and the strange phenomenon that flashed by became much clearer.

His power of the divine sense and spiritual energy were consumed at a terrifying rate. Even with Qin Yu’s monstrous divine sense and chaotic power, he could not withstand this consumption rate.

In a short while, the power of his divine sense was almost exhausted.

He had no choice but to sit cross-legged again to recover his depleted divine sense.

After countless attempts, Qin Yu finally grasped the fleeting image.

“Capture!”

Suo Lin turned into a giant shield. He flicked his right hand, and the strange phenomenon finally slowed down a little.

Under the desolate divine eye, the cultivation method began to become clearer. Under the gaze of the desolate divine eye, the activation of the cultivation method, one by one, began to unravel and reveal its origin.

A ray of golden light gradually condensed above his head.

“Soul Shattering Golden Radiance!”

Several people absorbing the power of the divine sense suddenly felt a cold sense of danger. When they opened their eyes, they saw the Soul Shattering Golden Radiance floating above Qin Yu’s head. Someone instantly lost his composure and shouted.

“You’re incredible! I was in retreat here for nearly 30 years before I comprehended the Shattering Soul Golden Radiance, and you managed to comprehend it in such a short time.”

Piao Ruoyun smiled bitterly and said, suddenly feeling a huge blow.

“It’s by luck.”

Qin Yu smiled and did not explain anything.

His Soul Torment Mind Technique allowed the speedy recovery of his divine sense. Otherwise, just recovering would take a long time.

Moreover, the desolate divine eye also played a crucial role. Otherwise, he would probably have taken a long time to comprehend it.

Some other cultivation methods were in the clouds, but the changes were overwhelming.

Sometimes, it would take a long time for a cultivation method to appear again. Qin Yu could wait if he had enough time. However, he needed to seize every second to increase his strength.

Qin Yu stood up, and a soul cultivation method flashed before his eyes.

Qin Yu suddenly felt a little strange. Who left behind this holy land of the Azure Firmament Sect? How did the cultivation method evolved by this ancestor last for thousands of years?

Each time the cultivation technique was activated, it required a certain amount of the power of divine sense.

Qin Yu thought of a terrifying possibility and stared fixedly at this soul space.

As soon as a cultivation method appeared, he activated his desolate divine eye.

However, he was not tracing the specific operational rules of those techniques but was tracing their origins.

Once, twice, until ten times…

Finally, after searching repeatedly and diligently, Qin Yu discovered one of the spatial points.

He chased after that point. His speed was tremendously fast as he stepped into that spatial point.

Like a galloping horse, the scenes before his eyes changed rapidly. Finally, he arrived at a place of green hills and tea plants. A scholar was leisurely fishing with his back facing him.

With a sigh, he turned around and looked at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu noticed the person’s face looked very young. Somehow it gave him a feeling that this person seemed to have experienced numerous vicissitudes. Everything in the world seemed to be a dream. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Being able to find this place is fate. Therefore, I shall bestow you the Path of Reincarnation, regardless of whether it brings you blessings or misfortune.”

The scholar chanted softly. His voice made people feel very comfortable as if he was reciting a poem.

A ray of light swept toward Qin Yu. Qin Yu had never experienced such an internal qi before.

Every part of his body felt an inexplicable danger. Without hesitation, golden light erupted from his body, and the cosmic form soared into the sky.

However, the moment he came into contact with the light, his Saintly Body Technique, his chaotic power, and his cosmic form all disappeared. His entire body was suddenly pulled up, passing through countless spaces and arriving at a space.

“Qin Yu, quickly come home for dinner!”

In a farmhouse, a couple was shouting.

“Are you calling me?”

The two pulled Qin Yu into the house.

“Silly child, who else if it’s not you?” The two looked at Qin Yu with a smile.

“Father, Mother.” Looking at the familiar face, Qin Yu suddenly fell silent.

…

“Qin Yu, this is our baby!”

Yan Ruoxue, in a room, carried a baby and placed it in Qin Yu’s hands.

…

In another space, Qin Yu stood on the peak of the mountain.

Below him, countless cultivators stood respectfully.

Every scene was a lifetime that contained all of Qin Yu’s regrets.

Qin Yu became increasingly silent.

“Child, it’s almost Father’s time. Don’t cry.”

Before the bed, an elderly man smiled and slowly closed his eyes.

…

“Qin Yu, I’ll be leaving first.”

Yan Ruoxue, with her head full of gray hair, said to him with a smile.

…

At the mountain peak, the number of cultivators behind him dwindled until only he was left behind.

Qin Yu kept walking forward and slowly realized that he was beginning to age.

His waist began to bend, and confusion filled his eyes.

His parents had lived with him for a lifetime. He married Yan Ruoxue, had his child, and stood at the peak…

However, he was starting to get tired. He just wanted to have a good sleep without anyone waking him up.

“This is not true…”

Qin Yu said softly.

“No, this is true. This is another reincarnation of you. You can go back anytime if you want.”

A scholar stood in front of Qin Yu.

Qin Yu was silent. His parents and Yan Ruoxue knew everything about him, and Qin Yu did not feel any falsehood. He could not break through the barrier in this lifetime.

It was like a person who had lived for a lifetime and suddenly was told that this lifetime was fake. And now, he was told to go back to the past, cut off all ties, and start anew.

His hair gradually turned white, his golden core began to melt, and his muscles began to shrink.

Qin Yu started to have difficulty breathing, and he suddenly laughed.

“I remember a long time ago, a girl called Ruoxue. She was waiting for me. And my father. Even if he had died, he still protected me. At that time, I was no longer lost. However, I still have to thank you for letting me experience all of this. I believe all these are true.”

Qin Yu said to the scholar with a smile.

“You can go back now. You can return to the past by cutting off all karma.”

The scholar said with a faint smile.

He transformed into Yan Ruoxue, his father, and his mother. The three of them stood there smiling.
