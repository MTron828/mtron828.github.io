Chapter 125: The Useless Wu Hongchang Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Mr. Qin, I hope you don’t mind,” Lu Shuming explained.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I don’t mind.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh. It was quite tiring for these rich people to provide for their hangers-on.

Because once a person had some abilities, they wouldn’t be willing to submit to other people, making it difficult for them to obey orders.

Just like how Wu Hongchang currently was.

“It’s better if you have the ability yourself.” Qin Yu thought inside.

“Everyone, don’t be too nervous. Perhaps nothing will happen today.” Lu Shuming waved his hand and comforted everyone.

Wu Hongchang laughed out loud and said, “Nervous? Mr. Lu, apart from being excited, I don’t feel anything else!”

“That’s true. With Mr. Wu here, we won’t be nervous,” the other people said with a smile.

The flattery of the other people made Wu Hongchang even more proud.

Wanting to show off to Qin Yu, he even glanced at Qin Yu deliberately.

Unfortunately, Qin Yu sat there with his eyes closed while looking out of place.

“Humph, pretentious show-off.” Wu Hongchang couldn’t help but snort.

At this moment, the door was suddenly opened.

Updates by

The moment it was opened, two men who were about the same age as Wu Hongchang walk in.

The moment they stepped into the room, Qin Yu opened his eyes immediately!

Because he could clearly feel that these two people’s internal qi was extremely powerful, and they were definitely above Wu Hongchang’s level!

“Lu Shuming, long time no see.” One of the men with a scar on his face looked at Lu Shuming coldly and said.

When facing this man, Lu Shuming looked awkward and somewhat fearful.

The man with a scar on his face sat in front of Lu Shuming. He glanced at the crowd and sneered. “Are these people all sent by you to deal with me?”

“They are all my friends. When they heard that I had something to attend to, they came to help me.” Lu Shuming seemed to be deliberately showing off his current connections.

The man with a scar on his face sneered. “Lu Shuming, you are still the same as before. You’re still in the habit of making sarcastic jabs at people.”

Lu Shuming frowned slightly. He went straight to the point and said, “What is it that you came back for this time? Just say it.”

“Hahahaha!” The man with the scarred face couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“I came back to South City for two things.”

“First, to take back what belongs to me.”

“Second, to kill you!”

His few words instantly made the atmosphere tense up!

Lu Shuming’s expression was also slightly unsightly.

He took a deep breath and said, “It’s no longer the era of dealing with things with violence. How about this, I’ll give you a sum of money and let bygones be bygones between us from now on.”

“Let bygones be bygones?” The muscles on the face of the man with a scar instantly twitched.

He angrily shouted, “From the moment you left a scar on my face, I swore I would kill you! Do you know what kind of life I’ve led abroad all these years?! I want you to suffer thousands of times the pain I’ve suffered these five years!”

Lu Shuming’s expression was a little ugly. He looked at the man with a scar on his face coldly and said, “So there’s no peaceful way of dealing with it?”

“You want a peaceful way of dealing with it? Sure.” The man with the scarred face sneered.

“Let me slash your face first, then kneel on the ground and beg me. Maybe I can show mercy and let you get out of South City then.” The man with the scarred face said derisively.

At this point, the man with the scarred face paused and then continued, “Just like how you treated me back then.”

“Hehe.”

At this time, Wu Hongchang spoke up.

He looked at the man with the scarred face and said with a nonchalant smile, “From the conversation between the two of you, I seem to have understood something.”

“Back then, Mr. Lu showed mercy and kindly spared your life. You should remember this favor and not come back to bite people like a vicious dog,” Wu Hongchang said indifferently.

The man with the scarred face looked at Wu Hongchang coldly and said, “Who are you? Do you have the right to speak here?”

“This is Wu Hongchang! He is also Mr. Lu’s top hanger-on!” Someone beside him shouted loudly.

Wu Hongchang stroked his beard and smiled nonchalantly with a proud expression on his face.

“Bullsh * t. Mr. Wu? I’ve never heard of him.” The man with the scarred face sneered.

“Lu Shuming, do you have no one else working under you? You found such an old fart to stand up for you?” The man with the scarred face had a mocking expression.

Before Lu Shuming could say anything, Wu Hongchang flew into a rage and slammed the table!

“You maniac, you’re too big for your britches! How dare you speak so arrogantly?!” Wu Hongchang scolded angrily.

“I’m a ninth stage Inner Strength Master Hands, and I’m only a step away from the Inner Strength Past Master realm. You ignorant maniac!” Wu Hongchang put his hands behind his back and acted like a big shot.

Hearing this, the man with the scarred face couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“A ninth stage Inner Strength Master Hands dares to boast about himself? When the cat’s away, the mice will play.!” The man with the scarred face said coldly.

Wu Hongchang couldn’t hold it in anymore. He mobilized the Inner Strength in his body and instantly rushed toward the man with the scarred face!

“Today, I will let this lunatic know how powerful I am!” Wu Hongchang raised his head and shouted.

Although Wu Hongchang was quite old, his speed was extremely fast, and his strength was even more shocking!

Before his fist even punched him, there was a gust of wind from the momentum of the fist!

“As expected of Mr. Wu!” Someone couldn’t help but exclaim.

“This punch will definitely decide the outcome!”

Everyone shouted one after another, and their faces were filled with shock from Wu Hongchang’s strength.

However, before Wu Hongchang’s fist touched the man with the scarred face, his body was sent flying!

Before the crowd could even see what had happened, Wu Hongchang had already fallen to the ground and spat out blood!

“I can’t believe the release of Inner Strength could reach such a level.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but think inside.

The scene was completely silent. The crowd held their breaths.

“He is indeed an expert. I, Wu Hongchang, am willing to admit defeat!” Seeing that the situation was bad, Wu Hongchang, immediately fell to the ground and didn’t even have the intention to stand up.

“Old people like you should just retire,” the man with the scarred face mocked.

Lu Shuming, on the other hand, was filled with fear. He shouted anxiously, “Mr. ... Mr. Wu, Mr. Wu?”

However, Wu Hongchang had already been scared out of his wits. When he heard Lu Shuming’s shouts, not only did he ignore him, but he even laid on the ground and played dead.

This made Lu Shuming feel despair. He hurriedly looked at the other hangers-on around him and shouted, “Everyone, please join hands and restrain him together. I, Lu Shuming, will definitely reward you guys handsomely!”

However, everyone shook their heads and whispered, “Mr. Lu, it’s not that we don’t want to help. Even Mr. Wu isn’t his match. What can we do?”

“That’s right. If we go up now, won’t we be sending ourselves to our deaths...”

“Mr. Lu, why don’t you follow this gentleman’s instructions and kneel on the ground to apologize and draw a knife across your face...”

When he heard everyone’s words, Lu Shuming’s expression turned livid with anger! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He had spent a lot of money to support this group of hangers-on, yet they actually said such words at the critical moment!
