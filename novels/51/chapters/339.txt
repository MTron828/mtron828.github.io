Chapter 340: Unhinged Luo Cheng Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

This person was none other than Luo Cheng, from the Chuzhou Chinese Medicine Association! He was Zhou Tong’s disciple!

Luo Cheng’s countenance had become somewhat sinister. He had also become much thinner, and he looked very ghastly.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Luo Cheng, how did you become like this? Did you... cultivate some evil technique?”

Luo Cheng said with a vicious look, “It’s all because of you...”

“Because of me?” Qin Yu frowned.

“I didn’t do anything to you back then, right?”

Luo Cheng said angrily, “Didn’t do anything? Because of you, my pride was completely shattered! My dreams were crushed!”

“If it weren’t for you, I would have definitely become the President of the Chinese Medicine Association and be respected by thousands of people!”

“But it was your appearance that ruined everything for me!”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but shake his head and said, “Luo Cheng, your ego is too fragile. Why, just because I beat you, your ego was bruised?”

“You don’t understand,” Luo Cheng said coldly.

“You don’t know at all what kind of state of mind a person who has been praised since young has.”

Qin Yu looked at Luo Cheng and said coldly, “Luo Cheng, it’s your own thoughts that have become distorted. Your greed surpasses your ambition.”

“Cut the crap!” Luo Cheng said coldly.

“I’m now a member of the Han family! You have no right to criticize me!”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more.

Qin Yu was a little shocked at Luo Cheng’s development.

Back then, Qin Yu had thought highly of Luo Cheng, but he didn’t expect him to go down the wrong path.

From Luo Cheng’s condition, he must have cultivated some evil technique that caused him to become like this.

“The Pavilion Master is here!”

At this moment, a loud shout came from outside.

Then, he saw the Pavilion Master, accompanied by many Law Enforcement Elders, slowly walk in.

“Greetings, Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.” Luo Cheng bowed to the Pavilion Master.

The Pavilion Master nodded. She didn’t seem to be too shocked by Luo Cheng’s appearance.

After the Pavilion Master arrived, she announced that the contest had officially begun.

Two medicinal cauldrons were placed in the middle, and a pile of rare herbs were freely available for the two of them to use.

Luo Cheng glanced at Qin Yu with a sinister look, then sneered. “Qin Yu, after half a year, I am no longer the Luo Cheng from back then.”

As soon as he said that, Luo Cheng opened his palm!

A ball of Blue Spirit Fire jumped on Luo Cheng’s palm!

Everyone couldn’t help but gasp!

Luo Cheng also had Blue Spirit Fire!

“Didn’t you have red Spirit Fire?” Qin Yu said with a frown.

Luo Cheng sneered. “This Blue Spirit Fire was given to me by the Han family. The Han family gave me everything!”

“Spirit Fire... can be given away?” Qin Yu was even more confused.

Luo Cheng snorted coldly and didn’t say anything more.

He put the herbs into the cauldron one after another and then began to refine the pill.

It had to be said that Luo Cheng’s pill refining technique had improved at a shocking speed.

In just half a year, his control over the Blue Spirit Fire had reached the stage of perfection!

This technique left everyone dumbstruck. Even Qin Yu felt a trace of pressure.

Therefore, Qin Yu didn’t dare to waste any more time. He immediately threw the herbs into the cauldron and began to refine the pill.

Qin Yu didn’t change his choice to refine the pill. It was the Nine Transformation Golden Pill.

The Nine Transformation Golden Pill was known as a Divine Medicine. Even in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, very few people could refine it.

As for the Han family, there was no need to mention it. Qin Yu didn’t believe that they had such a strong foundation.

Most importantly, Qin Yu needed fewer herbs to refine the Nine Transformation Golden Pill than the others.

Under everyone’s watchful eyes, two balls of Blue Spirit Fires danced within the medicinal cauldron.

The speed of the two people was almost equal, and the grade of the pill seemed to be Earth Rank.

Time passed minute by minute, and in the blink of an eye, the sky gradually darkened. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The pill within Qin Yu’s cauldron had already begun to slowly take shape.

On the other hand, Luo Cheng’s pill seemed to be one step short!

This made Luo Cheng’s expression turn somewhat ugly, and a trace of anxiety even flashed across his face!

It was precisely because of the change in his state of mind that Luo Cheng’s flame had deviated.

“Hu!”

The Blue Spirit Fire was extremely wild and burned the herbs in the cauldron into ashes!

“How... how could this be?!” Luo Cheng became even more panicked.

He stared at the herbs in his cauldron that had turned into ashes, and a hint of despair flashed across his face.

And at this moment, Qin Yu’s Nine Transformation Golden Pill had apparently been successfully refined.

The Danyun Phenomenon in the sky was also slowly condensing.

“Buzz!”

A ray of light flashed, and the Nine Transformation Golden Pill landed in Qin Yu’s hand.

The crowd immediately erupted into thunderous applause, and the Pavilion Master’s eyes flashed with a hint of admiration.

Qin Yu handed the Nine Transformation Golden Pill to the Elder, and then looked at Luo Cheng.

“Luo Cheng, you lost,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Luo Cheng acted as if he didn’t hear it, and only kept muttering, “How could this be? How could this be...”

Seeing Luo Cheng’s attitude, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh and say, “Luo Cheng, you don’t have to be sad. You’re talented. I believe that the Pavilion Master will let you stay in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

To any alchemist, the Divine Alchemist Pavilion was the most sacred pavilion. Luo Cheng was no exception.

Being able to join the Divine Alchemist Pavilion was the best proof of one’s alchemy skills.

However, Luo Cheng glared at Qin Yu angrily, as if he had gone mad!

A trace of grief and indignation flashed across his face, and his body trembled.

“Stay in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion? Qin Yu, you make it sound so easy!” Luo Cheng practically roared out these words!

He said with some pain, “You are an Elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. You are High and mighty, and respected by tens of thousands of people, yet I have fallen into this state!”

“In order to get this Blue Spirit Fire, I tried my best to please the Han family. I was willing to work hard for them...”

“But even so, they didn’t treat me as a human at all!”

“All of this is because of you. It’s all because of you! If I hadn’t met you, I wouldn’t have become obsessed with getting this flame!”

Luo Cheng’s frenzied state confused the crowd.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “It’s just a loss, so why are you so worked up? Although you didn’t become an Elder this time, it’s not certain in the future...”

“I don’t have a chance! I don’t have a chance!” Luo Cheng roared angrily!

“If I can’t beat you today, I will die here... To the Han family, I will no longer have any value..”

“I don’t want to die... I don’t want to die...” Luo Cheng’s expression became distorted, and his entire body began to tremble wildly!

Qin Yu’s expression changed, and he said with a frown, “Luo Cheng, what... is wrong with you?”

“Hu!”

At this moment, Luo Cheng’s entire body was suddenly enveloped by the Spirit Fire! His entire body burned!

He rushed towards Qin Yu at an extremely fast speed!

Wherever he went would be contaminated by the Blue Spirit Fire and turn into ashes!

The entire pavilion instantly became extremely chaotic!

Numerous pharmacists were fleeing in all directions!

“Whoosh!”

In the blink of an eye, Luo Cheng arrived in front of Qin Yu. His fists that were wrapped in flames smashed towards Qin Yu fiercely!

“I don’t want to die... I don’t want to die...” From the depths of the flames, Luo Cheng’s pained voice could be heard.
