Chapter 1622: Chapter 1622, the Lord of the northern lands makes a move Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh when he heard Wen Wanyi’s words.

He could also see that Wen Wanyi’s temper and personality were like that of an old child. However, what he said did make sense.

Qin Yu sat up with difficulty. He still wanted to continue refining the pill, but the people around him surrounded him.

“Qin Yu, you should rest well now.”

“Yeah, if this continues, I’m afraid something will really happen.”

“The entire South Province has already regarded you as their hope. If anything happens to you, no one will allow it.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. What these people said made some sense.

Moreover, with Qin Yu’s current condition, if he continued to refine the pill, his efficiency would probably become worse and worse, and he might even make mistakes.

Thus, Qin Yu nodded and said, “Alright, I’ll listen to you guys. I’ll rest for a few days first.”

After that, Qin Yu followed behind Wen Wanyi and returned to the room.

Once he got onto the bed, Qin Yu quickly fell asleep.

Everyone gathered around Qin Yu’s bed, feeling very unhappy.

Now that a great disaster was at hand, they couldn’t help much, so how could they not feel sad.

“Sigh, an expert is better than a million strong soldiers,”someone sighed.

“I really don’t know when the sect leader of the Heavenly Cloud sect will appear.”

“One by one, our ancestors have fallen, but we can’t be of much help. It’s really not a good feeling.”

“Fortunately, we can be considered to have welcomed a short respite.”

In the blink of an eye, nearly a month had passed.

During this month, the southern region had indeed become much calmer. Even many cultivators of the northern region had retreated to the northern border.

The northern region.

The three great deaths had gathered together as if they were discussing something.

In front of them were three magical artifacts.

These three magical artifacts looked extremely ancient, and there were extremely strange characters engraved on them.

These characters were very difficult to understand, but three of them were very eye-catching.

Those three characters were none other than the immortal slaying sect.

“Although our actions have been hindered, we have temporarily obtained the northern border,”said one of the godly monarchs.

“That’s right, it’s time to activate this magical artifact.”

With that said, the two godly monarchs looked at Sima bei.

Sima bei said in a deep voice, “What you said makes sense. However, these two scrolls should be sacrificed to the Lord First.”

“Only two scrolls are insignificant to the Lord. It might even attract the lord’s rebuke.”

Sima bei did not say a word. Just as the two godly monarchs said, after spending so much time, he had only collected two scrolls. It was indeed shabby.

“There are still two more scrolls.”

At this moment, someone suddenly walked in from outside.

Looking Up, it was actually Yong Ji.

Behind Yong Ji was a youth.

This youth was also dressed in a black robe. However, there was an obvious ‘teng’character carved on the black robe.

Seeing these two people, the three godly monarchs’expressions immediately turned cold.

“Yong Ji, who allowed you to bring people to the northern lands?”One of the godly monarchs asked coldly.

Yong Ji looked at he teng beside him and smiled, “This is he teng, the sect leader of the South Province’s Teng sect.”

“Greetings, three godly monarchs...”He Teng said darkly.

“You are he teng? Rui Yi was injured by you? !”One of the godly monarchs said angrily. His body instantly emitted a cold chill!

However, he teng was not frightened. He said calmly, “The three godly monarchs of the strange northern lands, I don’t think they will be angry because of a woman, right?”

The two godly monarchs were about to get angry, but Sima bei stopped them and said, “He teng, we have already agreed to your conditions to enter the northern lands. It’s time for you to show us your value.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“That’s right. The reason I came this time is precisely for this matter,”he teng said faintly.

After saying this, he flipped his palm and took out the two scrolls that he had snatched.

“In order to express our sincerity, I will return these two scrolls to you,”he teng said.

After saying this, he threw his palm and the two scrolls fell into Sima Bei’s hands.

Sima bei carefully examined them. There was nothing wrong with these scrolls. They were precisely the divine sense and spiritual Qi that the northern lands cultivators had absorbed.

“That’s right.”Sima bei nodded slightly.

“Then how do you plan to serve us?”

He Teng opened his mouth and was about to speak when the voices of the three godly monarchs sounded in their minds.

This voice originated from the signal that the master of the northern lands had summoned them!

The three of them looked at each other before looking at he teng.

“You wait here for now. We’ll be right back,”Sima Bei said coldly.

“Let him come with us...”

At this moment, an extremely majestic voice sounded in the minds of the three of them!

This voice was none other than the lord of the northern lands!

The three godly monarchs were immediately shocked and could not help but kneel down on the ground! Their expression turned solemn!

“It’s the Lord’s voice! The Lord has consciousness!”A godly monarch exclaimed.

“Finally... The Lord has finally gained consciousness! This is great. We’ve finally waited for this day!”

For so long, the Lord of the northern lands had transmitted their signals in an extremely strange manner. He had never said anything.

But now, his voice was transmitted over. This was enough to prove that the lord of the northern lands was not far from reviving!

“Kid, you are blessed.”Sima bei said coldly.

“The Lord wants to see you.”A godly king beside him took over.

Yong Ji could not help but frown. He tried to ask, “May I ask, Lord Godly King, did the lord say that he wanted to see me?”

“No.”Sima bei said without hesitation.

Yong Ji opened his mouth and wanted to say something, but Sima Bei and the others did not give him a chance. They turned around and walked out.

He Teng followed closely behind the three people and walked towards the snow mountain of the Northern Land Lord.

After the three of them left, Yong Ji couldn’t help but clench his fist.

He had been in the northern land for so long, but he had never met the northern land lord!

And he teng, who had just arrived in the northern land, was summoned immediately!

How could Yong Ji, who had an extremely high temperament, endure such humiliation! !

“Why... is that so!”Yong Ji suppressed his anger and his entire face was almost contorted.

But after a moment, the anger on his face slowly faded away.

...

On the Snowy Mountain in the center of the northern lands.

The three godly monarchs and he teng were standing there, slightly bowing as if they were waiting for the emperor’s order.

After a while, a voice came from the snowy mountain, “Have you entered the Southern Region?”

Sima bei and the others naturally did not dare to be negligent. They hurriedly told the master of the northern lands what had happened.

“We were about to succeed, but an extremely powerful person suddenly appeared in the southern region and stopped our progress.”Sima bei cupped his hands and said.

“Other than him, there’s also the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect. One of our godly monarchs was killed by his avatar.”Another godly monarch hurriedly said.

“Trash.”

The snow mountain rumbled. That voice was extremely majestic. Even he teng could not help but tremble slightly.
