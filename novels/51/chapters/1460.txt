Chapter 1461: Chapter 1,461, passing through the eternal limit city

From here to the Green Rock Forest, they would pass through the eternal limit city.

Qin Yu flew over the Eternal Limit City on the Divine Eagle.

Looking down from above, the eternal limit city was filled with cheers and laughter, and the scene was prosperous.

The structure of the entire city was impregnable.

There were many arrays in the eternal limit city, and each array was formed from the outline of the Great Dao, with boundless power.

Anyone who could enter the Eternal City had an extraordinary status.

They were either people of great wealth or powerful people.

Qin Yu looked down at this city, which didn’t look huge, and felt the aura emitted from it.

Every strand of aura was quite extraordinary.

“This eternal city looks like a city of bliss,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

This city clearly looked very prosperous, but for some reason, Qin Yu didn’t like it at all.

There was no other reason. This city gave Qin Yu the feeling that it was a paradise for people with status.

And in such a place, white bones were usually buried behind.

Qin Yu didn’t stay too long. He just flew across the sky above Yongji City.

But even so, Mister Eternal Pole still felt Qin Yu’s aura.

He sat in the hall, his eyes piercing through the thick walls, looking straight at Qin Yu who was rushing past.

“Foster father, Qin Yu just flew over our eternal pole city.”At this time, Eternal Pole’s foster son walked forward and said.

Eternal Pole drank a mouthful of tea and said indifferently, “I saw it.”

The foster son frowned and said, “Foster Father, you just saved his life. He passed through our city, but he didn’t have any intention of visiting you. He...”

The Foster Son didn’t finish his words, but the meaning was very obvious.

Yong Ji didn’t care. He smiled and said, “What difference does it make whether he visits you or not?”

The foster son opened his mouth. He wanted to say something, but was interrupted by Yong Ji with a wave of his hand.

“This Qin Yu is a little too arrogant,”his foster son thought to himself.

“Does he really think that by killing Ling Yun, he can ascend to the top of South Province? He’s just a frog at the bottom of a well.”

This kind of thought lingered in the hearts of almost every foster son in Yongji city.

...

After an unknown amount of time, Qin Yu finally arrived near Qingyan Forest once again.

This place was the same as before. A few stars away from the Green Rock Forest, there were tea pavilions, restaurants, and so on.

Qin Yu put away the Divine Eagle and walked towards the edge of the Green Rock Forest.

It was noon, but there were already many people gathered near the green rock forest.

They seemed to be waiting, waiting to enter the Green Rock Forest Tomorrow.

Qin Yu released his spiritual sense, covering a radius of nearly ten stars, in an attempt to find the figure of the Fang.

Unfortunately, even though Qin Yu’s spiritual sense was strong, he still couldn’t find Fang.

“He must have gone hunting,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Fang’s small team would enter Qingyan Forest to hunt almost every day, and today was no exception.

Fortunately, Qin Yu was not in a hurry. He simply found a place to sit down and waited for the sky to turn dark.

As long as the sky turned dark, Fang would definitely leave Qingyan Forest.

Time passed by minute by minute. Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly and tried to absorb the surrounding spiritual energy.

However, the spiritual energy here was too thin. Even if he cultivated with all his strength, the effect would be minimal.

“Qin Yu? Mr. Qin, are you going to step into Qingyan forest too?”

“It’s Qin Yu? He’s actually here too!”

“Mr. Qin, can we step into Qingyan Forest Together?”

Upon hearing Qin Yu’s name, many people quickly gathered around them.

They all wanted to pull Qin Yu into their team to provide more protection for their team.

Facing everyone’s invitation, Qin Yu could only reject them one by one. Then, he closed his eyes again.

Time flew, and the sky gradually darkened.

Many people also walked out of the Green Rock Forest. Some were seriously injured, some were full of joy, and of course, some stayed in the green rock forest forever.

Qin Yu hurriedly stood up. He released his divine sense, afraid that he would miss it.

But after a long time, Qin Yu still did not find any traces of Fang Fang.

Seeing that the sky was getting darker and fewer people walked out of the Green Rock Forest, Qin Yu also had a bad premonition.

“Could it be that... something happened to Fang Fang?”Qin Yu frowned.

Hunting in the green rock forest was like stepping into the underworld. No one could guarantee that they could escape unscathed.

As time passed, the sky was completely dark.

Qin Yu stood there and stared at the Green Rock Forest.

There was no one in the green rock forest. At this time, those who should have left should have already left.

Qin Yu’s expression became more and more serious. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

He swept his gaze around and said in a low voice, “May I ask who here knows Fang Fang?”

This voice contained spiritual power. Although it was low, it reached everyone’s ears.

“May I ask who knows Fang? If there is news of Fang, I, Qin Yu, will definitely give you a big thank you,”Qin Yu repeated.

The people around all turned their heads to look in Qin Yu’s direction, but no one said anything.

Just as Qin Yu was about to give up, someone suddenly walked towards Qin Yu.

“Mr. Qin, the Fang you mentioned, is it the Fang that hunts here?”

The person who spoke was a young rough man. There were clearly visible scars on his body.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “That’s right.”

The rough man sighed and said, “Mr. Qin, I’m afraid you won’t be able to find him.”

Qin Yu’s face slightly changed, and she hurriedly asked, “Where did he go?”

The rough man said with a somewhat regretful tone, “Their small team was killed by the Mo family.”
