Chapter 457: He Teng Comes to Attack Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Golden light surrounded Qin Yu’s fist.

A terrifying internal qi seemed to clash with the forbidden power on the door.

Then, Qin Yu roared, and his golden fist smashed towards the door!

Boom!

A loud sound exploded!

The huge force caused the door to shake a little.

And outside the door, a barrier quickly formed.

Looking at this barrier, Qin Yu said in a low voice, “This barrier seems to be somewhat similar to the one on Meng Wuxiong’s body back then.”

Then, Qin Yu clenched his fist again and smashed it fiercely.

The barrier appeared again and blocked Qin Yu’s fist.

Qin Yu snorted coldly, then immediately summoned the Venerable Fifth Mountain and suspended it above his head.

With the support of a magic artifact, Qin Yu’s strength had entered another level.

His terrifying fist produced bursts of explosive sounds at this moment.

“Let me see just how sturdy this door of yours is!” Qin Yu snorted coldly and then ruthlessly smashed his fist over!

“Boom!!”

The door began to shake at this moment! Cracks appeared on the barrier that was lingering outside!

Qin Yu didn’t say anything, but clenched his fist and stood up!

One punch, two punches, three punches!

A huge explosion shook the valley. The birds and beasts seemed to have been startled, and they let out sky-piercing wails.

Finally, when Qin Yu threw his fifth punch, this level of barrier shattered with a loud bang!

The door finally lost its protection.

“It seems that this barrier isn’t all that impressive,” Qin Yu said with a cold snort.

He reached out his hand and slowly pushed open the door.

The moment the door was opened, traces of spiritual energy rippled over!

This spiritual energy was different from that of herbs. It seemed to be purer.

It was as if all the spiritual energy was locked by this Water Rhyme Tower!

A trace of surprise flashed through Qin Yu’s eyes, followed by ecstasy!

“I’ve never seen this kind of spiritual energy before!” Qin Yu exclaimed in shock!

Just this spiritual energy alone was enough to increase Qin Yu’s strength greatly!

However, Qin Yu knew very well that spiritual energy was probably not the only secret in this Water Rhyme Tower.

That was because relying solely on spiritual energy, people like Meng Wuxiong definitely wouldn’t be able to reach the peak of the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm.

“Is there a secret treasure like the Enlightenment Tea here?” Qin Yu scanned his surroundings and thought to himself.

There were a total of five levels in the Water Rhyme Tower, and each level was extremely wide.

As Qin Yu climbed, the spiritual energy became denser.

When Qin Yu reached the fifth level, the dense spiritual energy almost suffocated him!

“There’s definitely something wrong with this tower!” Qin Yu said in surprise.

The spiritual energy in the tower was obviously so dense, but there wasn’t a single trace of spiritual energy around the tower.

The only explanation was that the tower used a spirit-locking array to ensure that the spiritual energy wouldn’t leak out.

As for where the spiritual energy came from, Qin Yu didn’t know.

On the fifth level of the Water Rhyme Tower, Qin Yu didn’t find any treasure.

Just as Qin Yu was feeling extremely distressed, he suddenly realized that his realm seemed to be slowly increasing without him realizing it.

“Huh?” A hint of surprise flashed across Qin Yu’s face.

Could it be... That this tower had a similar effect to Enlightenment Tea? It could allow a person to increase their realm in a short period of time?

If that was really the case, then wouldn’t the path of cultivation in the future be smooth sailing?

“There’s actually such a treasure in this world?” Qin Yu was excited!

He hurriedly sat down cross-legged and tried to absorb the surrounding spiritual energy.

Endless amounts of spiritual energy rushed towards Qin Yu’s body.

With the Meridian Circulation Technique that Qin Yu obtained, Qin Yu successfully stepped into the third level of the Enlightenment Stage in just one day!

He was now a third level Inner Strength Grandmaster!

Such speed was simply jaw-dropping!

“This is simply a large-scale Enlightenment Tea!” Qin Yu exclaimed in shock.

Although the effect wasn’t as simple and crude as the Enlightenment Tea, it could be used by many people!

If he borrowed this Water Rhyme Tower, wouldn’t it be easy to establish a sect?!

Qin Yu tried to find out the secret of this Water Rhyme Tower, but unfortunately, he couldn’t find the secret even after searching the entire Water Rhyme Tower.

“It seems that it’s impossible to take this tower away,” Qin Yu Qin thought to himself.

However, greed was brewing in Qin Yu’s heart.

“Since I can’t take it away, I’ll try my best to make it my own.” Qin Yu opened his mouth and revealed a sly smile.

Then, Qin Yu didn’t waste any more time. He sat cross-legged on the ground and tried to cultivate in seclusion.

After all, He Teng who could come knocking at his door at any time.

A trace of internal qi, combined with Qin Yu’s Meridian Circulation Technique, slowly cultivated in this Water Rhyme Tower.

At this time, there was already an uproar in Chuzhou.

Word of He Teng’s challenge had almost spread throughout the entire martial arts world.

As the center of the conflict, Chuzhou naturally received attention.

The officials of Chuzhou were rather happy. Because of He Teng, the number of tourists in Chuzhou skyrocketed!

In just a few days, countless people had come to the provincial capital of Chuzhou to witness this legendary battle.

Three days later, He Tengfinally arrived in Chuzhou.

News of his arrival spread quickly.

“He Teng has arrived in Chuzhou!”

“If I’m not mistaken, his aim is probably Qin Yu!”

“Qin Yu has kept a low profile recently. Could he have run away in advance?”

Just as everyone was discussing, He Teng immediately arrived at Qin Yu’s mansion after arriving in Chuzhou.

Unfortunately, Qin Yu wasn’t there at all.

He Teng wasn’t in a hurry. He immediately sent out a message:

“Qin Yu, I’ll give you three days. If you don’t show up, Don’t blame me for being merciless.”

After this message was sent out, there was still no news from Qin Yu’s side.

Time passed by minute by minute, and in the blink of an eye, the second day had arrived.

However, Qin Yu seemed to have disappeared from the world and was nowhere to be seen.

He Teng couldn’t help but frown and said in a low voice, “If Qin Yu doesn’t appear, don’t tell me I have to stay in Chuzhou for the rest of my life!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“You can try to attack the people around Qin Yu... Spread the word that as long as he doesn’t appear at the agreed time, you will attack the people around him.”

“For each day he doesn’t show up, kill a person.” That hoarse voice rang out in He Teng’s mind.

He Teng snickered. “Do you think I haven’t thought about it? This is a society ruled by law. How could I publicly clamor to kill people?!”

Different from ordinary martial artists, He Teng was extremely ambitious.

Not only did he want to become number one in the Central Plains, but he also wanted to make the He family the number one family in the Central Plains!

He even wanted to have the same status as the aristocratic families in Jingdu!

Therefore, he definitely wouldn’t act like a desperado.

However, at this moment, He Teng’s cell phone suddenly rang.

When he picked up the phone, he heard an extremely dignified voice from the other end.

“You’re He Teng?” The other party said coldly.

He Teng frowned slightly and said indifferently, “Who are you?”

“Han Meng, of Jingdu’s Han family.” The other party said coldly.
