Chapter 266: Qin Yu’s Father Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Moreover, Qin Yu couldn’t tolerate the actions of the Earth Fiend Valley.

Over the years, they had kidnapped countless young girls and harmed countless families!

“The Earth Fiend Valley... must be destroyed!” Qin Yu gnashed his teeth in extreme anger!

...

Jiang Gu quickly arrived at the airport. After buying the tickets, the two of them took a plane to the southwest.

“Mr. Qin, although the Earth Fiend Valley has declined over the years, it shouldn’t be a problem to deal with one or two Inner Strength Grandmasters,” said Jiang Gu.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I know.”

Jiang Gu, wanting to say something, opened his mouth but in the end, he didn’t say anything.

During this period, Jiang Gu had already grasped Qin Yu’s personality.

Once he made a decision, no one could say anything to change his mind.

After sitting on the plane, Qin Yu took out the stone statue.

The Earth Fiend Valley’s ancestor’s strength had already reached its limit. Qin Yu didn’t know if he could borrow it a second time.

After thinking about it, Qin Yu finally gave up this idea.

Moreover... Qin Yu also wanted to know what his current strength was.

Just as Qin Yu was about to put away the stone statue, a piercing pain suddenly came to his head!

Then, Qin Yu’s divine sense was sucked into the stone statue.

As usual, as soon as Qin Yu’s divine sense entered the stone statue, he was smacked to the ground by the ancestor of the Earth Fiend Valley!

He was extremely fierce and ruthless, and he directly attacked the divine sense. Qin Yu grimaced in pain.

“Have you found the way to break the seal?” The ancestor said coldly.

Looking at the ancestor, Qin Yu couldn’t help but recall the evil deeds done by the Earth Fiend Valley.

This also made Qin Yu’s expression turn cold. He wished he could kill the ancestor right away!

But in the end, Qin Yu still endured it.

He took a deep breath and tried his best to maintain a smile. “I have found it.”

When the ancestor heard it, he was instantly overjoyed!

“Quick, remove the seal for me!” The ancestor roared crazily!

A series of ear-piercing sounds almost shattered Qin Yu’s divine sense!

Qin Yu endured the pain and said wryly, “The seal has been found, but there was an accident.”

“What?!” The ancestor was furious. He suddenly raised his hand and pinched Qin Yu’s divine sense in it.

“Ah!!”

The pain was beyond imagination. Qin Yu’s face instantly turned extremely pale, and his whole body trembled non-stop!

Qin Yu’s body was sweating profusely, and his face was pale.

“Are you kidding me?! Accidents keep happening again and again. Do you think I’m stupid?!” The ancestor said coldly.

“I think you just don’t want me to go out. You want control over the Earth Fiend Valley!”

Qin Yu suppressed the anger inside and said, “I absolutely have no such intention. It’s Qin Yu... I don’t know where he got the news, but he snatched the method to remove the seal...”

“Qin Yu? It’s Qin Yu again!” At the mention of this name, the ancestor was enraged to the point of madness!

“I want to kill him! I want to tear him into ten thousand pieces! I want to pull out his tendons and skin him alive!”

When he saw his furious look, Qin Yu snickered inside.

“The chaotic body lives up to its reputation. Even if I borrow your strength to advance to the Grandmaster realm, I’m still not his match.” Qin Yu sighed.

The ancestor didn’t seem to be surprised.

He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “The chaotic body is invincible among those of the same level. It’s not a rumor. It’s understandable that you’re not his match.”

“What should we do now? If we don’t get rid of Qin Yu, the Earth Fiend Valley will disappear, and you will never be able to leave this place...” Qin Yu sighed.

The ancestor glanced at Qin Yu and didn’t speak for a long time.

A few minutes later, he suddenly said, “I will temporarily lend you all my strength, but I will enter a dispirited state.”

“Huh? Then how can I bring myself to...” Although Qin Yu said this, he was so excited that he almost jumped up!

This idiot actually wanted to lend him all his strength!

“If you will suffer as a result, please forgive me for not being able to accept it!” Qin Yu pretended to be terrified and said.

The ancestor sneered and said, “It doesn’t matter. I only need the blood essence of a thousand young girls, and I will be able to recover to my peak.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu wanted to tear this ancestor into pieces immediately!

A thousand young girls were actually so insignificant to him!

The Earth Fiend Valley had existed for so many years, so how many people had it harmed?

Qin Yu could barely hold it in, but for the sake of the big picture, he still braced himself and said, “Well, this is the only way for now.”

The ancestor nodded and said, “But remember, you can only last for three days. You must kill him within these three days.”

“Three days is enough.” Qin Yu nodded and said.

The ancestor didn’t say anything more and immediately began to activate the spell.

At the same time, Qin Yu’s divine sense also left the stone statue and returned to his original body.

“Mr. Qin, are you okay?” Jiang Gu asked worriedly.

Qin Yu waved his hands repeatedly, but his expression was somewhat unsightly.

Waves of power that didn’t belong to him surged toward Qin Yu’s body wildly!

Qin Yu’s body found it difficult to withstand such a huge force for a moment!

His dantian was about to explode, and his abdomen was throbbing with pain!

Qin Yu’s forehead was full of sweat. He gritted his teeth tightly, and his entire body was almost curled up!

“No... I have to hold it in, or else my dantian will explode...” Qin Yu could clearly feel that his dantian had reached the critical point of collapse!

If he were to transmit even a sliver into it, his dantian would definitely shatter!

“It’s over...” Qin Yu’s expression was pale and he felt terrified!

At this moment, Qin Yu’s dantian lit up with a ray of light!

The light seemed to suddenly come out from the darkness, and in the end, it actually turned into a large golden hand!

The huge hand covered Qin Yu’s dantian. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The violent power instantly became like a stream, and it stabilized.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel stunned.

Whose hand was this? Where did it come from? Why did it appear in his body?

Before Qin Yu could react, the huge hand had already disappeared without a trace.

Qin Yu was filled with shock as countless thoughts flashed through his mind.

“Could it be...” Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

“Could it be a backup plan left behind by my father?” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

Other than his father, Qin Yu couldn’t think of any other possibilities!

“It must be so! It must be so!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little excited!

From a young age, Qin Yu had always envied the children of other families.

And this kind of lack of familial affection made Qin Yu have low self-esteem.

He felt that he was a child that no one loved, and he even hated his parents.

But it was only now that Qin Yu slowly came to a realization.

Although his father didn’t accompany Qin Yu as he grew up, he had already secretly paved the way for himself.

“Father...” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice, and he couldn’t help but well up with tears.

Sure enough, there was no one who didn’t love their child.

However, why did his father never come to see him?
