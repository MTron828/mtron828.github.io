Chapter 921: Chapter 921, Xu Huaigu appeared!

“Do you think I’m F * cking afraid of You? !”Kong Yun shouted as he threw a pair of iron fists at Qiao Zun!

“Bang!”

The two fists collided with an earth-shattering BOOM!

Countless people at the scene immediately looked over!

The fight between the two had undoubtedly pushed the conflict that had been brewing for a long time to the surface!

“F * ck, what’s so great about you disciples from the Mystic Realm? Are You Afraid of Me? !”

“The strength of the people from our mystic realm is above yours!”

“F * ck you, I’ve long disliked you!”

The scene instantly became chaotic. Both sides fought, and the entire scene was extremely chaotic.

Qin Yu, who was hiding in the dark, was also a little angry.

These disciples from the secret realm were too arrogant. If they did not teach them a lesson, they would only become more arrogant.

Taking advantage of the chaos, Qin Yu secretly kicked the person in the secret realm and ran away after that.

After a series of operations, Qin Yu kicked and broke a few of them.

“Damn it, I don’t even like beating people up.”Qin Yu could not help but curse in his heart.

In order not to expose his identity, Qin Yu could only change his location with one shot.

Seeing that the battle was getting more and more intense, the martial saints standing on top of the mountain could no longer sit still.

“If this continues, they will definitely affect this huge mine,”a martial saint said.

“Yes, it’s necessary to stop them.”

Gu Xinghe said quietly, “We still need them for the time being, and we also need their people’s hearts. So, don’t go too far.”

Even though that was the case, Gu Xinghe also looked down on the martial artists of this world.

The battle between Kong Yun and Qiao Zun was still ongoing. As the two of them were responsible for each other’s strength, they naturally attracted the most attention.

Even Qin Yu was silently watching.

“Kong Yun’s strength is not below this Qiao Zun,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

If the battle continued, Kong Yun’s chances of winning would even be higher.

Not only that, Kong Yun’s originally irritable personality was displayed to the extreme at this moment.

“Boom!”

Kong Yun seized the opportunity and smashed his fist on Qiao Zun’s chest.

Qiao Zun was pushed back a few steps, and his chest caved in.

“Come on, I’ll Rip Off Your Arrogant Head Today!”Kong Yun was full of fire and fighting spirit.

But at this moment, a mystic realm disciple joined the battlefield!

In an instant, Kong Yun changed from one to one to three!

In the situation where there was not much difference in strength, Kong Yun immediately fell into a stalemate. He was beaten back repeatedly by Qiao Zun and kept vomiting blood.

Seeing this, Qin Yu’s face instantly turned extremely cold.

He gritted his teeth and almost could not hold it in anymore.

“Three against one, what kind of ability is that!”

At this moment, a rough voice was heard!

It was none other than the sacred physique Chang Mang!

The moment Chang Mang entered the battlefield, the situation was reversed once again!

Under the situation of two against three, the mystic realm disciple actually did not have the upper hand at all and even retreated in defeat!

Seeing that the situation was not good, another mystic realm disciple immediately joined in!

“Hehe, are you bullying US Mystic Realm Disciples?”Wan Gu Qiong who had been watching the battle sneered and instantly joined in.

The scene immediately became even more chaotic. Chang Mang and Kong Yun had to face five mystic realm disciples!

Even though the two of them were heaven’s favored sons, it was difficult for them to fight against four hands with two fists. Soon, they were at a disadvantage.

“F * ck!”Qin Yu, who was watching the battle from the side, could not hold it in any longer.

He tightened his cap, his body flashed explosively, and instantly joined in!

Qin Yu withdrew the Golden Light, and with only his pure physical body, he threw a punch toward Wan Gu Qiong’s incoming fist!

“Clang!”

Under the huge collision, the fist that was supposed to land on Chang Mang’s body was knocked back by Qin Yu’s punch!

“Deng Deng Deng!”

Wan Gu Qiong took a few steps back, and his face instantly became a little cold.

“You have some ability, who are you?”Wan Gu Qiong asked coldly.

Qin Yu did not answer, but only responded with a steel-like fist!

With Qin Yu’s addition, these five disciples of the mystic realm could not withstand the fury of the three of them at all. They were beaten back repeatedly!

Meanwhile, Qin Yu’s anger that he had suppressed for a long time was finally released.

“Boom!”

Qin Yu fiercely punched the chest of the Wan Gu Qiong and shattered his sternum!

“All of you, Stop!”

At this moment, a loud shout suddenly silenced the scene.

A white-haired martial saint walked over!

“Uncle Otter!”Qiao Zun hurriedly walked over when he saw this old man.

The martial saint who was called Uncle Otter walked over directly.

He stood in front of Qiao Zun and looked at the martial saint and the others coldly.

In the end, his gaze fell on Kong Yun.

Before Kong Yun could speak, Uncle Otter suddenly slapped Kong Yun’s face!

This slap had directly covered Kong Yun’s face with blood!

“F * ck your mother!”Kong Yun was instantly enraged. Without a word, he wanted to attack Uncle Otter.

However, this uncle otter was a martial saint. In front of him, Kong Yun did not have the ability to retaliate at all.

Therefore, everyone hurriedly stopped Kong Yun.

“Calm down. He is a martial saint. If we fight with him, we will die without a doubt.”Someone beside him said.

However, Kong Yun could not suppress the anger in his heart. He struggled with all his might and wanted to fight with Uncle Otter.

Uncle Otter looked at Kong Yun coldly and said, “You are reckless. Do you really know how to fight?”

Then, Uncle Otter extended his palm and a wisp of internal Qi lightly landed on Kong Yun’s body.

With just this attack, Kong Yun’s entire body went soft and he fell to the ground with a bang.

He glared at Uncle Otter, but he could not move at all.

“Kong Yun! Are You Alright? !”Everyone quickly surrounded him. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Uncle Otter said coldly, “Don’t worry, I didn’t kill him. I only taught him a small lesson.”

Although he said that, from Kong Yun’s expression, he should be in extreme pain at this moment.

Qiao Zun slowly walked to Kong Yun and said condescendingly, “See? This is what you all end up with. Without a martial saint, all of you are just a bunch of ants!”

When they saw this scene, many of the current disciples’faces were filled with grief and indignation. However, they could not do anything to them!

Just as Qiao Zun had said, without a martial saint, they had no dignity at all!

Qiao Zun slowly stood up from the ground.

His gaze fell on Chang Mang and Qin Yu.

“Who are the two of you to dare to attack us?”Qiao Zun narrowed his eyes and said.

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly, and he knew something was wrong.

At least Kong Yun still had a background, so Qiao Zun did not dare to kill him.

However, Qin Yu was different from Chang Mang. The two of them had no background, and Qiao Zun had no scruples.

“Uncle Otter, kill the two of them,”Qiao Zun snorted coldly.

Uncle Otter did not say anything. He just walked towards the two of them.

“Two ants trying to climb up to the Sky? What a joke,”uncle Otter said coldly.

Then, he saw Uncle Otter raise his hand.

His palm was surrounded by light, and a wave of killing intent assaulted his face.

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely unsightly. He looked at Uncle Otter warily and quietly mobilized the internal Qi in his body. It was best to be prepared to resist.

“You don’t know life from Death!”Uncle Otter shouted loudly, and his palm instantly covered the two of them!

But at this moment, a stream of light quietly passed by and blocked in front of Qin Yu and Chang Mang!

Uncle Otter frowned and said coldly, “Who’s the busybody!”

The scene was silent as they all looked towards the east.

They saw an old man slowly walking over from the east.

“It’s Xu Huaigu!”Someone shouted in shock.
