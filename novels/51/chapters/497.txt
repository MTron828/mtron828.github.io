Chapter 498: The Desparate Saint Confucian Sect Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Gu Canghai was about to personally take action and capture Qin Yu!

He was a genuine Martial Marquis! The level of a Martial Marquis and a half-step Martial Marquis were two different worlds!

A Martial Marquis was a Golden Core Stage cultivator in the cultivation world!

Their bodies had already formed a Golden Core, and their strength had reached another level! It was definitely not something a half-step Martial Marquis could compare to!

On the same day, Gu Canghai posted this news on the Martial Arts Forum.

Not only that, but Gu Canghai also posted a bounty on the Martial Arts Forum:

Anyone who provided Qin Yu’s whereabouts would be able to obtain a thousand-year-old herb king and ten million in cash!

Such a high price showed Gu Canghai’s determination and anger!

...

Inside the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, the Fifth Elder rushed in with his phone in hand.

“Qin Yu, Gu Canghai has personally taken action and he wants to capture you!” The Fifth Elder was somewhat fearful.

Qin Yu, however, appeared rather calm. He glanced at The Fifth Elder and nodded. “I understand.”

The Fifth Elder was stunned and hurriedly said, “Qin Yu, do you know that Gu Canghai is a Martial Marquis? Aren’t you worried?”

“What’s the use of worrying?” Qin Yu slowly stood up from the bed.

“Even if he doesn’t come looking for me, I will still go looking for him.” Qin Yu said with a cold smile.

The Fifth Elder was instantly stunned.

Qin Yu wanted to go looking for Gu Canghai? Wasn’t he sending himself to his death?

“Qin Yu, with your talent, it’s only a matter of time before you step into the Martial Marquis Realm. In the future, you can even reach a higher realm! Why is there a need to confront him head-on at this time?!” The Fifth Elder explained anxiously.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Fifth Elder, I know what to do. Don’t worry.”

After saying that, Qin Yu walked straight out of the Elder’s residence.

“Where are you going?” The Fifth Elder asked in puzzlement.

Qin Yu said coldly, “I’m going to kill the dregs of the Saint Confucian Sect.”

After saying that, Qin Yu walked out of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

As the number one sect in the north, the Saint Confucian Sect had countless aristocratic families that were affiliated with the Saint Confucian Sect!

Not only were they the lackeys of the Saint Confucian Sect, but they also relied on the Saint Confucian Sect for a living.

Qin Yu knew that he was no match for Gu Canghai, but he had his own advantages.

He was alone and extremely fast.

“Saint Confucian Sect, I will make you pay a painful price,” Qin Yu said coldly.

In the past few days, Qin Yu had already prepared a list of the sects under the Saint Confucian Sect.

He took out this list and went to visit them one by one.

Cang Province, Tai City.

The largest aristocratic family in Tai City was the Li family.

The Li family had hundreds of millions of assets. They owned real estate, entertainment facilities, and other businesses.

The Li family was also one of the lackeys of the Saint Confucian Sect. They had several Inner Strength Grandmasters, so no one dared to provoke them.

That night, Qin Yu arrived at the entrance of the Li family.

He scanned his surroundings, then strode into the Li family.

After a while, the Li family’s home shone, and incessant wails rang out!

In less than half an hour, the head of the Li family died tragically on the stomach of a woman!

And the Inner Strength Grandmasters sent by the Saint Confucian Sect were all killed by Qin Yu with a single slap!

Another day passed, and the head of the Sun family of the Central Plains was beheaded! All eight Inner Strength Grandmasters were killed!

In the next few days, one bad news after another kept coming out.

The head of the Zhao family had died in his office, and three Inner Strength Grandmasters had died.

The head of the Hu family had died on the dining table, and none of the eight Inner Strength Grandmasters were left alive.

The head of the Bai family had died in his study, and a half-step Martial Marquis had become a dried corpse!

These people who had been beheaded all had the same characteristic, and that was that they all came from the Saint Confucian Sect!

Qin Yu announced on the Martial Arts Forum:

I don’t believe that the Saint Confucian Sect can protect everyone! So what if you, Gu Canghai, are a Martial Marquis? As long as I’m still alive, I will slaughter all the people with ties to the Saint Confucian Sect!

As Gu Canghai heard the bad news one after another, he felt exasperated!

“Qin Yu... Qin Yu!!” Gu Canghai suddenly shattered the chopping board!

“Go, find him for me!” Gu Canghai gnashed his teeth and said.

Elder Qu quickly walked forward and said in a low voice, “Sect master, we tried to find Qin Yu, but he is extremely fast. He goes to different cities every day.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Every time, when we arrive, he has already run away...”

Another Elder walked over and said in a trembling voice, “Sect master, the people of the Saint Confucian Sect are in a state of panic. Those aristocratic families that have submitted to the Saint Confucian Sect have also cut off their relations with us...”

“Sect master, if this continues, we will lose at least billions of dollars every year...”

Gu Canghai panted heavily and was so angry that he was trembling.

“No matter what, I will kill Qin Yu!” Gu Canghai gritted his teeth.

He immediately got Elder Qu to pull out a list of all the aristocratic families with ties to the Saint Confucian Sect.

“Didn’t Qin Yu say that he wanted to destroy the Saint Confucian Sect? Fine, then I will go and wait for him!” Gu Canghai said coldly.

“As long as Qin Yu dares to appear, I’ll definitely kill him!”

After saying this, Gu Canghai turned around and left.

However, Qin Yu didn’t go to the next aristocratic family.

He quietly arrived near the Saint Confucian Sect and waited there quietly.

Not long after Gu Canghai left, Qin Yu immediately barged into the Saint Confucian Sect and started a massacre!

There were at least hundreds of disciples who remained in the Saint Confucian Sect that day. In the end, they were all turned into corpses, and not a single one was left!

When Gu Canghai rushed back, the Saint Confucian Sect was already covered in blood!

“Ah!!!”

Gu Canghai roared crazily!

His hair flapped wildly, and his roar spread throughout the entire Saint Confucian Sect!

“Qin Yu, I must catch you!” Gu Canghai gnashed his teeth in anger!

“Sect master, after Qin Yu’s ruckus, our disciples are starting to be afraid...” an Elder said.

“Many disciples want to resign and go home...”

“I’ve also received many resignation letters. There are at least dozens of them... among them, there is no lack of peak Inner Strength Grandmasters.”

Peak Inner Strength Grandmasters were the power reserves of the Saint Confucian Sect!

As long as they had the spirit spring in their hands, the Saint Confucian Sect would have the chance to turn them into half-step Martial Marquises!

But now, because of Qin Yu’s crazy behavior, he had scared away these disciples and those who wanted to join the Saint Confucian Sect!

For a moment, Gu Canghai had a headache.

He rubbed his forehead and said in a low voice, “Go pull up the surveillance footage and find Qin Yu for me!”

“Sect master, do you think you can find Qin Yu through the surveillance footage? He can change places at lightning speed, so who can catch him...”

Gu Canghai couldn’t help but frown.

He had never thought that just Qin Yu alone would cause the glorious Saint Confucian Sect to fall into decline!

“I have an idea.” At this moment, Elder Qu stood out.

Gu Canghai glanced coldly at Elder Qu and said, “What idea?”

Elder Qu thought for a moment and said, “We can pretend to negotiate and trick Qin Yu into coming over!”

“I believe that as long as our conditions are high enough, Qin Yu will definitely agree!”

“As long as Qin Yu dares to show up, he will never be able to leave!”
