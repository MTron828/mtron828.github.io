Chapter 281: Qin Yu’s Choice Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

When he heard Yan Jiang’s words, Qin Yu’s face instantly turned pale.

An unprecedented sense of crisis almost swallowed Qin Yu.

Yan Jiang stood up and was ready to leave. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Wait!”

At this time, Qin Yu called out to Yan Jiang again.

He walked to Yan Jiang quickly and said slowly, “Can you let me see your true strength?”

Yan Jiang was stunned and asked in confusion, “What do you mean?”

“I want to know how big the gap is between you and me.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

Yan Jiang frowned slightly.

He said in a deep voice, “You might get injured.”

“It’s fine as long as you don’t kill me.” Qin Yu turned around and went into the courtyard.

Yan Jiang thought for a moment and finally followed him out.

Their eyes met and Yan Jiang asked, “Are you sure you want to fight me?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I’m sure. I hope you won’t show any mercy.”

After saying that, the qi energy in Qin Yu’s body burst out in an instant!

This was Qin Yu’s own strength, and he didn’t rely on the power from the ancestor from the Earth Fiend Valley!

Therefore, the current Qin Yu was still far from becoming an Inner Strength Grandmaster.

Yan Jiang looked at Qin Yu, who was bursting with golden light, and said coldly, “Fine, I’ll satisfy you.”

With that said, Yan Jiang’s body disappeared into thin air and appeared in front of Qin Yu in almost an instant!

When facing Yan Jiang, Qin Yu didn’t dare to hide his strength. He roared angrily and immediately activated the third level of the Saintly Body Technique!

And the fist that greeted Yan Jiang was Qin Yu’s trump card, the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist!

The two fists collided, creating a huge gust of wind!

Strong wind swept up in an instant, and the surrounding trees were uprooted!

The golden light on Qin Yu’s fist started to crack.

Then, after the golden light retreated, Qin Yu used his physical body to receive the punch.

His body was forced back before smashing into the wall behind him.

His arm was almost shattered, and his entire body was covered in blood.

Even after Qin Yu had tempered his body, he couldn’t win against Yan Jiang!

Looking at Qin Yu, who was lying on the ground, Yan Jiang slowly walked over.

“You have improved very fast, but it’s not enough,” Yan Jiang said.

Qin Yu fell to the ground and didn’t say anything.

He stared at the sky, and the moonlight shone on his face.

“Han Wei... is stronger than Yan Jiang?” Qin Yu murmured.

Yan Jiang left, and Qin Yu laid on the ground without getting up for a long time.

Countless thoughts flashed through his mind, and he looked a little numb.

Ten minutes later, Qin Yu struggled to get up from the ground.

He endured the pain in his body, and he became determined again.

“I won’t lose to Han Wei, and I won’t lose to the Yan family.” Qin Yu’s voice was a little cold.

He quickly sat cross-legged on the ground and began to heal himself.

Then, he took out the pill from the snakeskin bag.

These pills were the purest inner strength of a martial artist, and their effects weren’t inferior to those of Divine Medicine.

Qin Yu kept stuffing them into his mouth.

Soon, he reached the critical point of his breakthrough.

Perhaps the truth of the Yan family’s situation had dealt him a blow, or perhaps the difference in strength had triggered Qin Yu’s fighting spirit.

In short, Qin Yu’s realm seemed to have improved a lot without him realizing it.

The breakthrough was extremely smooth this time. Qin Yu easily crossed this level and directly stepped into the eighth level of the Foundation Establishment Stage.

At this time, the sky had already lit up, and Yao Qing had also returned from outside.

He looked at the surrounding environment and hurriedly said, “Mr. Qin, what happened?”

Qin Yu shook his head and didn’t say anything. He just kept stuffing the pills into his mouth.

“Oh right, I’ll give these pills to you.” Qin Yu didn’t swallow all the pills from the Earth Fiend Valley.

He distributed the three bags among himself, Jiang Gu, and Yao Qing.

The remaining bag would be the cornerstone of the breakthrough.

Qin Yu continued to swallow the pills. The long-term spiritual energy input had caused a great burden to his dantian.

However, Qin Yu had no intention of giving up. He continued swallowing all the pills in the snakeskin pouch.

The purest inner strength burst out in Qin Yu’s dantian and almost ruptured the entire dantian.

The excruciating pain made Qin Yu’s face sweat.

However, there was no change in his expression. He looked extremely calm.

Qin Yu guided the inner strength in his dantian and circulated it through his meridians.

This was to offset the burden on his dantian.

Slowly, the pain in Qin Yu’s dantian began to disappear.

It was obvious that Qin Yu’s experiment had succeeded.

If he didn’t have this method, Qin Yu’s consumption of the pill would be too restrictive.

This would also prolong Qin Yu’s cultivation indefinitely.

After three days and three nights, Qin Yu finally reached the boundary of the ninth level of the Foundation Establishment Stage.

However, his spiritual energy was almost drained, so Qin Yu could only give up temporarily.

He stood up from the ground and picked up the Spatial Magic Artifact that Yan Jiang had given him to examine it.

Yan Jiang didn’t tell Qin Yu how to use the Spatial Magic Artifact, so Qin Yu could only fumble around on his own.

His divine sense moved, and a strand of blood essence flew out from between his brows.

Qin Yu dripped this drop of blood essence onto the Spatial Magic Artifact, but he discovered that the Spatial Magic Artifact didn’t have the slightest reaction.

“Looks like this method isn’t right.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

Then, he sent another strand of divine sense into the Spatial Magic Artifact.

“Buzz!”

Finally, the Spatial Magic Artifact had a reaction!

Rays of light bloomed on the Spatial Magic Artifact, and Qin Yu’s divine sense could enter and exit the Spatial Magic Artifact at will.

He could control the Spatial Magic Artifact through his will.

“This really is a treasure,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He walked around the Spatial Magic Artifact, and other than the three corpses, there was nothing inside.

Therefore, Qin Yu withdrew his divine sense.

He stood up from the ground and an idea appeared in his mind.

Qin Yu took out his cell phone and called Jiang Gu.

After the call was connected, Qin Yu said, “Help me arrange an appointment with the four big families in Chuzhou.”

Jiang Gu was stunned and said in surprise, “Arrange an appointment with the four big families? Mr. Qin, did something come up?”

“Well, it’s something like that,” Qin Yu said.

Jiang Gu asked, “When?”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “Tomorrow then.”

Although Jiang Gu was a little puzzled, he still agreed.

After Qin Yu hung up the phone, coldness flashed across his face.

After this conversation with Yan Jiang, Qin Yu understood one thing:

The growth of the bottom level would inevitably be accompanied by the competition for resources.

This King of Chuzhou couldn’t have an empty title.
