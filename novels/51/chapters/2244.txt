2245 Lurking Murderous Intent

“What a terrifying speed! Even my divine sense can’t lock onto this speed.”

Uncle Ling exclaimed.

“Xi Menn’s Way of the Sword domain belongs to the heavenly sword. Everywhere is heaven. He can’t avoid it.”

The evil extermination rarely spoke.

“Once Xi Menn’s sword is out, everyone must die. Although this kid is not bad, he will not survive.”

“I don’t know what grudge they hold against each other, but Xi Menn rarely attacks human cultivators.”

“Who knows? Perhaps this kid doesn’t know his limits and has provoked Xi Menn.”

“I know this kid. He’s too arrogant. This time, he’s finally met his match. Get ready to die!”

Xuan Yuan laughed heartily among the group of demonic beasts.

In the Path of Heaven, heaven and earth were full of swords. Xi Menn was on the eighth level, but that sword had never left Qin Yu’s heart.

“Sword of Domain!”

Qin Yu gasped.

With such speed, he believed he could shake it off regardless of who it was.

However, the sword never left before him. The pure sword energy did not weaken in the slightest.

The massive sword aurora almost covered the sky in the world of rules.

Qin Yu accelerated again, shaking off the sword aurora a fist away.

He suddenly stopped. The distance of this fist finally gave him a chance to catch his breath.

The chaotic qi in his body surged into his fist without holding back. Qin Yu’s fist emitted a Golden Light that was ten thousand feet tall.

The golden radiance seemed to suppress even the radiance of the stars in the sky.

At this moment, his soul did the same thing.

The power of his soul surged into his sea of consciousness, and a giant phantom gradually materialized above him.

The Spiritualization Technique!

The shadow of divine sense did the same thing as Qin Yu. It was an archer. It then threw out a punch.

“Give me the power of the soul!”

An indifferent voice suddenly appeared in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness. The black divine sense figurine suddenly opened its eyes.

As if sensing the shocking sword intent, this black Qin Yu communicated with Qin Yu for the first time.

“The black figurine does have its own divine sense!”

At this moment, Qin Yu could no longer care about his shock. In this moment of life and death, he did not hesitate to split half of his divine sense and use it on the black figurine of Qin Yu.

“Boom!”

A massive shadow of the Inferno Demon God suddenly appeared on the other side of the golden soul. The demon god wielded a trident and thrust it forward.

The fifth level of purgatory was instantly enveloped by a layer of dense gloomy internal qi. Black clouds instantly surged through the entire fifth level of purgatory.

A giant golden light and a giant black light intertwined with each other. Two humongous shadows stood in the void like gods.

Even the people on the ninth level could feel the chilling and gloomy coldness.

“The phantom of demon god! What’s that? What a terrifying internal qi!”

Ling Yurou’s face turned pale.

“It seems to be the internal qi of the netherworld!” Uncle Ling was also somewhat bewildered.

A trace of killing intent flashed across the evil exterminator’s face.

The Heavenly Sword.

Xi Menn was expressionless. He held a sword in his hand and gently thrust it forward.

The giant Heavenly Sword that pierced through the eighth, seventh, sixth, and fifth levels of purgatory stabbed out.

Qin Yu’s fist, the golden Qin Yu’s fist in the sky, and the black Qin Yu’s trident came into contact at the same time.

At this moment, it was as if time had stopped, and even sound swallowed.

In the fifth level, almost all demonic beast cultivators with low cultivation were turned into countless pieces instantly. Those above the True Saint were also seriously injured.

Countless demonic beast cultivators frantically escaped from the fifth level of purgatory. The scene was even more terrifying than the heavenly tribulation.

Sword shadows, golden light, and demonic god power filled the sky as they frantically cut through the space of the fifth level of purgatory.

Countless flames spewed out from the ground, and the entire space seemed to collapse at any moment.

Three different colors of gold, white, and black filled the space.

After dozens of seconds, a sharp sound came from the void.

It lasted a quarter of an hour before the terrifying tremors gradually subsided.

Xi Menn slowly put away his sword. His face was a little pale as he returned to his previous seat.

Some demonic beasts and cultivators in the surroundings were eager to make a move. However, when they saw the sword in his hand, they did not make a move in the end.

At this moment, Qin Yu looked even paler. Blood stained the clothes on his body.

Behind Qin Yu, a ravine of sword energy several hundred feet deep extended to the fourth level of the space of purgatory.

The injuries on his body weren’t severe. After being tempered by the bone cultivation water, Qin Yu’s skin and internal organs had already become as tough as a demonic beast.

The sword energy had only pierced his skin and did not affect his foundation at all.

The most terrifying thing about the Heavenly Sword was its sword intent.

It was not the actual sword energy that slashed the enormous ravine behind him.

Instead, it was by the almost materialized power of the sword intent.

Qin Yu’s consciousness was already close to unconscious. He gritted his teeth and held on.

He was alone here. If he fainted, he would definitely die.

In the divine sea, the divine sense figurine had become tremendously dispirited. The black Qin Yu had even closed his eyes.

That attack just now had practically drained all of his divine sense.

“Whoosh!”

With a crisp sound of a bowstring, an arrow arrived before Qin Yu like a poisonous snake.

Qin Yu stretched out his hand, and the arrow sank half an inch into his shoulder.

The massive tremor sent his body flying.

“As expected, he has reached his limit after resisting Xi Menn.”

A glint flashed across Xing Mou’s face. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Kill him, and the reward from the Holy Region’s aristocratic families would be handsome. Moreover, he has a lot of secrets. ”

Wu Feng nodded slightly. He had no objections to dealing a heavy blow to those already in a precarious situation.

Moreover, Qin Yu’s secrets were too much for them to covet. Wu Feng could not figure out how a third-grade True Saint could have such terrifying strength.

Not only Wu Feng’s team but other cultivators were also eager to make a move.

Xing Mou narrowed his eyes as he nocked three arrows on the bowstring.

“Clang, Clang, Clang!”

Three arrows shot through the air. The third arrow struck the second arrow and then the first arrow fiercely.

Three Consecutive Stars!

The arrow was as fast as a stream of light, and it tore through the air toward Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu! I’m coming!”

A familiar roar sounded in Qin Yu’s ears.

“Jue Wu?”

Qin Yu revealed a look of disbelief.

Jue Wu’s elbow slammed the arrow, shattering it.

“You were the one who attacked my Qin Yu?”

Jue Wu stared coldly at Xing Mou.

Her expression was tremendously cold and stern. It was the first time Qin Yu had seen Jue Wu so angry.

“Boom!”

Xing Mou’s expression changed drastically. In a flash, Jue Wu arrived above him and slapped him.

He blocked it using the bowstring, and the bowstring was bent to the extreme.

“Ha!”

Jue Wu’s fist punched to the end, directly blasting Xing Mou flying.

With the tremendous force from the bowstring, Xing Mou retreated several hundred meters before finally coming to a stop.

Fear filled his eyes. “What a terrifying force!”

That attack just now seemed to have been directly attacked by a fierce demonic beast. It was indeed hard to imagine this attack was from a little girl who looked like a Loli.

“Is that enough?”

Qin Yu finally heaved a sigh of relief.
