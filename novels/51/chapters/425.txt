Chapter 426: Jiang Gu’s Choice Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth. His pale face made the bright red blood look even more ghastly.

“I’m fine.” Qin Yu shook his head.

As he spoke, Qin Yu tried to get up, but he stumbled and almost fell to the ground.

Yao Qing and Taozi, the worry on their faces becoming even more intense, hurriedly helped Qin Yu up.

“Mr. Qin, you’d better lie down properly,” Yao Qing said with a frown.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “I haven’t reached that level yet.”

It would be too fake if the acting was overboard.

Qin Yu stood up and walked all the way to the window of the living room.

He looked out of the window and asked in a low voice, “What month is it now?”

Taozi hurriedly said, “It’s the middle of May.”

“Mid-may... There are only three more months left.” Qin Yu, his face clearly showing a bit of worry, sighed.

“Elder Qin, are you still thinking about that matter?” Taozi, looking even more worried than Qin Yu himself, bit her lips.

Qin Yu sighed and said, “I have already paid too much for Yan Ruoxue. I’m not willing to give up just like that!”

After saying that, Qin Yu suddenly punched the glass.

Updates by

The glass immediately shattered before turning into sharp blades one after another!

Qin Yu’s pale face was reflected on every piece of glass.

Outside, one figure after another flashed past. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Their figures slowly disappeared in the darkness.

Little did they know that Qin Yu’s divine sense had never left their figures.

Only after everyone had disappeared did Qin Yu turn around and return to his room.

He continued to wait for the news to spread.

That night, the Martial Arts Forum exploded with comments!

Countless influential figures in the martial arts world began to express their opinions on the Martial Arts Forum.

“Qin Yu is probably really seriously injured. An internal qi injury was left behind in his dantian.”

“That’s right, I saw with my own eyes that he vomited blood non-stop, and his internal qi was extremely weak.”

“It seems that the prodigy of the generation is going to die in the end.”

The people who said these words were all people with considerable weight in the martial arts world.

The words they said naturally had more credibility!

At this moment, another person added fuel to the fire.

This person was Jing Lu.

Jing Lu personally expressed his opinion on the Martial Arts Forum.

“That day, I saw with my own eyes that the killing intent from Li Zinan’s formation had entered Qin Yu’s dantian. From then on, Qin Yu started vomiting blood and was forced to leave Yunchuan City,” Jing Lu said coldly.

“The current Qin Yu is no longer worth mentioning. To say that he is a prodigy of his generation is a little too exaggerated.”

The affirmation from various people immediately made this news seem much more real!

For a moment, countless people were eager to take the opportunity to kill Qin Yu!

Qin Yu had been in the limelight recently. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that he was a star in the martial arts world!

Therefore, who knew how many people in the dark wanted to step on Qin Yu to get to the top?!

Whoever killed Qin Yu would definitely be praised by everyone and become the new star of the martial arts world!

At this moment, Qin Yu was lying on the bed.

In the dark environment, the corners of Qin Yu’s mouth curled up into a smirk.

Then, he put his phone into his pocket and fell into a deep sleep.

The next morning, as soon as Qin Yu woke up, he saw Jiang Gu appear at the door.

This surprised Qin Yu a little.

He stood in the living room and thought for a moment, then walked to the door.

The moment the door opened, he saw Jiang Gu’s anxious expression.

“Mr. Qin, there are rumors everywhere that your dantian is damaged and your internal qi is weak. Is... Is it true?” Jiang Gu asked anxiously.

Qin Yu turned around and returned to the living room. He sat down on the sofa.

“Sit down.” Qin Yu patted the sofa and said.

Jiang Gu walked to the sofa and sat down uneasily.

“Mr. Qin, what’s going on?” Jiang Gu asked impatiently.

Qin Yu didn’t say a word. His eyes scanned Jiang Gu’s body.

He could clearly feel that Jiang Gu’s divine sense had swept over his body many times!

It was as if he wanted to find out if Qin Yu’s strength was really damaged or if he was faking it!

“What do you think?” Qin Yu asked indifferently.

Jiang Gu frowned and said, “I think it’s fake.”

Qin Yu sighed. He leaned against the sofa and said in a low voice, “I also hope it’s fake...”

Jiang Gu’s pupils suddenly dilated!

He stared at Qin Yu and said, “Mr. Qin, your... dantian really suffered a serious injury?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “To be precise, it left a hidden trauma. This hidden trauma may very well take my life.”

Jiang Gu’s face was gloomy. No one knew what he was thinking about.

“A hidden trauma in the dantian may affect the cultivation path in the future, and in the worst case, your internal strength will diminish and you will become a cripple,” Jiang Gu said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu sighed and said, “Yes.”

Jiang Gu didn’t say anything for a while. He looked at Qin Yu and countless expressions flashed across his face.

But in the end, Jiang Gu still recovered his calm.

He stood up and said, “Mr. Qin, during this period of time... you should be careful. If you need my help, just let me know. If you really can’t do it, just go to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion and hide.”

After saying that, Jiang Gu bowed to Qin Yu and turned to leave.

“Wait.”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly called out to Jiang Gu.

Jiang Gu paused. He turned around and said, “Mr. Qin, is there anything else?”

Qin Yu said with a nonchalant smile, “Jiang Gu, now is a good opportunity for you to kill me. Do you want to miss it just like that?”

Jiang Gu’s expression instantly turned extremely ugly!

He subconsciously took two steps back, and his face was filled with mixed emotions.

“To be honest, I did have the intention to kill just now.” Jiang Gu sighed.

“It’s because of you that I lost my son. It’s impossible to say that I don’t hate you.”

“Moreover, if I kill you now, not only will no one avenge you, but I can also regain a bright future...”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “You are right. Then why didn’t you make a move?”

Jiang Gu smiled bitterly and waved his hand. “Although you did bring disaster to me and the Jiang family, you also gave me an opportunity.”

“Pill, herbs, and even this body of mine were all given by you.”

“My hatred for you slowly disappeared without me knowing.”

After saying this, Jiang Gu cupped his hands to Qin Yu again.

“Mr. Qin, I will try my best to help you,” Jiang Gu said.

After saying this, Jiang Gu didn’t stay any longer and turned around to leave.
