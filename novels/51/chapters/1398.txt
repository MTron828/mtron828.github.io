Chapter 1399: Chapter 1,399, water of life in hand 1

The iron rod brought with it an intense force that split the air in two. Even the space itself started to crack!

The Hand of death was obviously unwilling to give up. It did not Dodge or Dodge as it clenched its fist and welcomed the attack!

“Clang!”

The strength of this iron rod was beyond imagination. Qin Yu only felt pain on his wrist and almost could not hold it anymore!

The situation of the hand of death was naturally even more miserable. His right fist was shattered and green blood flowed out!

Qin Yu did not care about the pain in his wrist. He held the Iron Rod again and roared angrily. He planned to take advantage of the victory and kill the hand of death.

But at this moment, the figure of the hand of death suddenly disappeared, as if it was hidden in space!

The iron rod smashed onto the ground, creating a huge crater.

Qin Yu frowned. He immediately activated his desolate God’s eye and scanned his surroundings.

However, what surprised him was that he still could not see any traces of the hand of death under the desolate God’s eye.

Qin Yu scanned the space and saw through the thick fog. Where could there be any traces?

“Oh? How can this be?”Qin Yu was stunned. He checked once again and sure enough, he still could not find any traces of the hand of death.

This made Qin Yu extremely uneasy. Since the desolate divine eye could not see it, it meant that its hiding method was even more advanced than the desolate divine eye.

“Could it be that it changed its meal to a deeper space?”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He looked around warily and did not dare to relax.

This was because Qin Yu knew very well that if this beast launched a sneak attack, it was very likely to be killed in one hit.

Qin Yu was treading on thin ice. He carefully looked around, but even in this situation, Qin Yu did not give up on advancing.

After walking for half an hour, the hand of death still did not appear.

“Could it be... that he escaped?”Qin Yu said with some doubt.

But in the blink of an eye, where could he have escaped to? How could he have run too far?

Forget it, forget about him. Let’s find the water of life first, Qin Yu thought to himself.

It was also at this time that Brother Dao, who was waiting outside, could not resist and tiptoed in.

Seeing Qin Yu covered in blood, Brother Dao quickly walked forward and frowned. “How are you? Where Is That Thing?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I’m fine. That Beast has already been beaten away by me.”

“Beaten away?”Brother Dao was stunned, then he waved his hand and said, “Don’t joke around. I have seen the ability of that Beast.”

Qin Yu did not explain to him. Instead, he smiled and asked, “This is not important. Brother Dao, where is the water of life? Quickly bring me there.”

Brother Dao grunted in gratitude. He immediately led the way and continued to walk deeper.

After passing through the place where the hand of death had stood, the two of them continued to walk forward.

Along the way, Qin Yu could be said to be terrified. He was afraid that the hand of death would attack again.

Fortunately, there was no danger along the way. The Hand of death did not appear again.

Soon, the two of them stopped at a stone cliff.

“This is the place.”Brother Dao stopped and pointed at the stone cliff.

It was a slope-like stone cliff. On the stone cliff, drops of dew were attached to it.

Strangely, these drops of dew stuck to the stone cliff but did not fall down.

Brother Dao pointed at the dew in front of him and said, “This is the water of life.”

Qin Yu said with some disappointment, “Is this all the water of life you mentioned?”

Brother Dao glanced at Qin Yu and said, “I can see that you are ignorant. Do you know how much life energy it takes to turn it into a drop of water of life?”

Qin Yu thought about it and agreed.

The amount of gas turned into liquid must be huge.

“Hurry up and collect it,”Brother Dao said and handed Qin Yu a jade clear bottle.

Qin Yu took the jade clear bottle and climbed up the cliff, carefully collecting the water of life.

There were a total of four drops of water of life here, and each drop exuded the aura of life.

Qin Yu collected all four drops of water of life into the jade clear bottle and then jumped down from the cliff.

“I finally got it.”Qin Yu shook the jade clear bottle and let out a long sigh of relief.

Then, Qin Yu looked at Brother Dao and said, “Brother Dao, there are four drops of the water of life in total. Two drops for each of us. How about it?”

Brother Dao rolled his eyes at Qin Yu and said, “Those four drops have already melted together. How are you going to share two drops with me?”

Qin Yu’s expression changed. He patted his head and only then remembered this matter.

“Brother... Brother Dao, don’t be anxious. I will immediately split the water of life into two parts!”Qin Yu hurriedly said.

However, Bro Dao shook his head and said, “Forget it. I know this water of life is very important to you. Take it.”

Qin Yu was stunned. He hurriedly looked at Bro Dao and said, “Bro Dao, is what you said true?”

“Do you think I have to lie to You? However, you have to owe me a big favor. Moreover, I believe that this favor will be returned to you soon,”said Bro Dao.

This time, Qin Yu did not stand on ceremony. He accepted the water of life and cupped his hands, saying, “Brother Dao, I will remember your favor. This water of life is indeed very important to me, so I won’t refuse.”

Brother Dao waved his hand and said, “Alright, let’s leave this place quickly.”

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude. He followed behind Brother Dao and quickly left this place.

After obtaining the water of life, Qin Yu did not want to waste any more time. He followed Brother Dao out of the waterfall and left the karst cave.

“Qin Yu, I won’t accompany you anymore.”Brother Dao said, “I still have something to do. Let’s part ways here.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Brother Dao, where can I find you?”Qin Yu hurriedly asked.

“Ask Sister Lin. She will tell you,”said Brother Dao.

After saying this, Brother Dao turned around and left.

In a few flashes, he disappeared without a trace.

“Phew.”Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief. “I finally have the water of life.”

At this moment.., tie Dan reminded him in his mind, “Don’t you think it’s a little strange? Since Brother Dao doesn’t dare to face the hand of death, how did he know the location of the water of life? “You have to know that the water of life is in the depths of the cave. If you want to see the water of life, you have to go through the hand of death.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He had never thought of this question.

“Maybe he deduced it through some method?”Qin Yu guessed.

Iron Egg shook his head and said, “It doesn’t seem like it. I think Brother Dao’s identity is not as simple as it looks.”
