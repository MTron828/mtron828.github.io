Chapter 1746: Temporarily Avoiding the Faceoff?

Qin Yu knew very well that Yuan Xiu was not easy to deal with.

He had the inheritance of the Immortal Slaying Sect in his hands. Although it was only superficial, it was already terrifying enough.

As long as he could not kill him in one go, he could make a comeback at any time.

Qin Yu extended his palm and grabbed the iron rod with one hand. He then looked at Yuan Xiu coldly.

!!

Yuan Xiu was in a rage. He glared at Qin Yu and the gigantic ax in his hand transformed into a long spear.

Although no one knew the origin of this spear, they all knew that it was extraordinary.

“You damned little bastard.” Yuan Xiu glared at Qin Yu and could not help but grit his teeth.

“What?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and sneered. “You know you’re no match for me, so you’re anxious?”

Upon hearing this, Yuan Xiu’s grip on his spear tightened.

“This is not your true strength. Although you have some talent, you have no chance of reaching the Reversion Void Stage!” Yuan Xiu said through gritted teeth.

“You’d better pray that you can beat me,” Qin Yu said coldly.

After he finished speaking, Qin Yu clenched his iron rod tightly and used the line word formula to instantly appear in front of Yuan Xiu!

Naturally, Yuan Xiu did not dare to be negligent. He used all his strength and the spear in his hand was aimed at Qin Yu’s forehead!

Qin Yu held the iron rod with both hands and immediately went up to him.

In an instant, a golden light burst out, and a terrifying aura lingered around the iron staff. It collided with the long spear for the second time.

Clang! Clang!

The sound of metal weapons colliding was extremely ear-piercing, and the shock waves directly flattened the distant mountain peak!

What was more shocking was that the divine weapon in Yuan Xiu’s hand was shattered and Yuan Xiu himself was forced to take a few steps back!

“Boom!”

Before Yuan Xiu could react, Qin Yu had already charged at him with his iron rod!

The iron rod seemed to sweep down from the nine Heavens. It was extremely terrifying. Yuan Xiu’s expression changed and his body instantly burst into rays of light!

The rays of light transformed into a mysterious armor that enveloped his entire body!

This armor was also an ancient divine weapon, and it was extremely terrifying. However, under the strike of the iron rod, it was shattered once again!

Yuan Xiu’s body crashed into the ground, creating a huge hole! Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Everyone was shocked to see this!

From the looks of it, this Yuan Xiu was no match for Qin Yu, who was only at the Reversion Void Stage!

“Kid, you!”

Yuan Xiu’s expression was extremely ugly. He touched his own body and felt pain from the impact. His head was buzzing as if his consciousness had been shaken out!

“If it wasn’t for that godly armor, I’m afraid that I would have become a corpse under that rod…” Yuan Xiu’s expression turned ugly and he broke out in a cold sweat.

“I can’t go on like this, or I might die here at any time.”

Yuan Xiu didn’t dare to think too much. He raised his hands as if he was about to cast a terrifying spell.

Qin Yu was also holding his breath and concentrating. He held the iron rod with both hands, and the golden light merged with the iron rod, as if it had become Qin Yu’s left and right arms.

“Wait!”

At this moment, Sima Bei suddenly dashed over and stood beside Yuan Xiu.

“What’s the matter?” Yuan Xiu’s face turned cold.

“This Qin Yu has only taken a Reversion Void Pill, this is not his true strength,” Sima Bei whispered.

“I too f*cking know. Do I need you to remind me?” Yuan Xiu was furious.

Sima Bei didn’t dare to say much. He said in a low voice, “Lord, I know you can definitely defeat him, but there’s no need to take this risk. The Reversion Void Pill can’t last for too long, so why don’t we avoid him for the time being?”

These words reminded Yuan Xiu of something. He was stunned for a moment and immediately felt that these words made sense.

That’s right. As long as this period of time passes, wouldn’t Qin Yu be an ant that could be trampled to death at any time?

At the thought of this, Yuan Xiu’s lips curled into a cold smile.

He looked at Qin Yu and said, “Your strength is not bad, but that’s all you’ve got. If I want to kill you, it’ll be as easy as raising my hand.”

“Cut the crap, are you trying to escape?” Qin Yu asked in a cold voice.

Yuan Xiu’s face darkened at his words.

Qin Yu knew that Yuan Xiu could escape from Nanzhou and return to the North Plain at any time, so he could only provoke him with words.

“The mighty Lord of North Plain is actually scared off by a junior and decided to escape back to the North Plain? ” Qin Yu said sarcastically.

“Yuan Xiu, I’m telling you, if you give me enough time, I’ll definitely kill you once I reach the Reversion Void Stage. You won’t have another chance then.”

“Of course, I can understand if you want to escape. After all, you are not my match.”

With a few words, Yuan Xiu immediately took the lead.

He glared at Qin Yu and shouted, “Who’s trying to escape?! You’re the one who should run!”

“Lord, don’t be fooled by him!” Sima Bei quickly reminded.

Only then did Yuan Xiu calm down. He gritted his teeth and said, “I’m just being kind and decided to let you go.”

“Hahaha! Weak and stubborn, I’m talking about you, right?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but raise his head and laugh.

“It’s courageous to admit that you’re weak, but you lack that courage.”

“Yuan Xiu, you’re too weak. You’re nothing except for the suppression of your realm.”

“You!” Yuan Xiu’s eyes were wide open and he was extremely furious.

However, he had slept for so long, so he naturally did not come to seek death.

Thus, Yuan Xiu finally calmed down.

“Qin Yu, I’d like to see how long your Reversion Void Pill can save you.” Yuan Xiu sneered.

“When your Reversion Void Pill loses its effect, no one will be able to save you!”

After saying that, Yuan Xiu no longer dared to listen to Qin Yu. He immediately hid in the darkness, stepped into the teleportation formation, and disappeared without a trace.

“Detestable…”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He had no way of pulling Yuan Xiu out of the teleportation formation, so he could only watch him escape.

The surroundings returned to silence, and Wen Wanchong and Qu Zhu quickly walked over.

“How do you feel?” Wen Wanchong asked.

Qin Yu shook his head and said with a frown, “Master, no matter what, you are not allowed to think about self-destructing again. We will find a way.”

Wen Wanchong scratched his head in embarrassment and said, “If I don’t self-destruct, won’t I be humiliated to death by him…”

“No matter what, the first thing we have to do is to ensure our survival.” Qin Yu said coldly.

“I know, I know,” Wen Wanchong could only laugh awkwardly.

“You’re still talking about others, ” Qu Zhu said with a smile. “The same applies to you.”

Qin Yu gave a wry smile. He opened his mouth and was about to say something, but a sense of powerlessness came over him.

The aura in his body was also fading away at an extremely fast speed.

“Quick, follow me to the Divine Capital City…” Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly. With his only consciousness, he pulled the two of them and quickly walked toward the Divine Capital City.
