Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

On the other end, a black dragon charged at the two of them angrily. Sensing the terrifying fluctuations, both of them revealed a solemn expression.

“I’ll try to control it. You detonate it as quickly as possible!”

Jiang Mingyue shouted.

With his shout, the black dragon’s speed suddenly slowed down. It then immediately screamed frantically.

Jiang Mingyue’s face suddenly turned ashen. His spirit was severely impacted instantly.

“Quick! You have to target it yourself! I don’t have any more strength to help you!”

He shouted. He had initially wanted to use Xiao Yunfei’s core explosion to detonate it and then rely on his ability to retreat quickly.

However, the necromancy army had unexpectedly counterattacked so quickly. They did not even manage to leave a few hundred meters away before being pursued. Moreover, what appeared was a necromancy black dragon that they had never seen before.

The strength of this black dragon was far beyond that of the giant ogres.

Moreover, its flying attribute completely suppressed them. As long as they were in the enemy camp, they could not escape this black dragon’s pursuit.

“Immediately!”

Xiao Yunfei’s pupils shone with a dangerous red light. As the red light illuminated, the temperature inside the body of the black dragon not far away kept rising rapidly.

“Boom!”

Almost at the same time, a terrifying consciousness swept over.

Xiao Yunfei and Jiang Ming Yue instantly fell onto the ground. Xiao Yunfei’s terrifying power lost his control and dissipated.

Without Xiao Yunfei’s mental control, the black dragon flapped its enormous bone wings.

It then fiercely charged toward the two individuals. Jiang Mingyue’s vision blurred.

A blood-red pill appeared in his hand. Without hesitation, he crushed it with his teeth and swallowed it.

The pill powder instantly turned into a surging energy, and his body turned into a sea of blood.

In an instant, the vitality and spirit of his body seemed to be boiling. The mental damage inflicted by Seifer’s attack was directly restored and even surpassed the previous peak to a higher level.

“Blood Burst Pill. It instantly detonates all the vitality in the body, allowing the user to reach the peak, but using it is fatal.”

Jiang Mingyue muttered to himself with a bitter smile. He had thought of persisting until the end, but in less than half a month, he was about to bid a final farewell to this Saint Kingdom.

“Freeze!”

His gaze turned cold and stern, and the black dragon’s enormous body shook violently.

Its entire body smashed onto the ground. Jiang Mingyue placed one hand on Xiao Yunfei’s shoulder.

“Junior Brother, you must fulfill Master’s instructions. Senior Brother will go first.”

“Senior Brother!”

Xiao Yunfei’s face turned pale.

Before he could say anything, his body had already been teleported a hundred meters away. At this moment, the power of the Spirit Recovery Pill had healed his severely injured soul.

He turned around and knelt in the direction of Jiang Mingyue. After that, he dove into the nearby underground passage not far away.

“Since I’m leaving, I’ll drag you along.”

Jiang Mingyue’s skin was as if boiling. Some parts of his skin even split open, revealing blood clots that had formed scabs.

He revealed a miserable smile and injected all his power into the black dragon before him. The black dragon instantly let out a shrill scream.

Li Yue held the necromancy candle in his hand, and his footsteps were very fast.

He had gone deep into a very remote place, and massive information constantly entering the mirror. At this moment, his mirror was flashing with an inexplicable brilliance, and the radiant glow was as if caused by the abundance of information.

“Indeed, it’s not a dead end. My judgment is correct. If Seifer could kill us, the chessboard wouldn’t have a red ending. The black outcome’s move resurrected from the dead, diverting a lot of attention. This chess game has come back to life.”

Li Yue frowned as he stared at the chessboard in his hand. It seemed that he could take another step forward, but the situation in front of him seemed even more dangerous. The red and black outcomes were changing rapidly.

He lit another candle. Seeing the red situation gaining the upper hand again, he continued moving forward.

With two necromancy candles, even if those giant ogres saw him, it was as if they were seeing their own kind.

Massive information entered the mirror again.

As he advanced, a ray of light suddenly entered his chessboard. Li Yue stopped in his tracks, and a living being appeared before him.

“You’re not a member of Seifer’s army. You’re an outsider of the monster race.” He said with a frown.

“What a powerful fellow! You could actually come so deep into this place. If I let you go deeper and record more information, it might affect the great battle.”

The demonic cultivator stared at Li Yue with a somewhat solemn expression.

The skin on his body seemed to have come alive. It slowly squirmed and expanded, forming a grotesque ghost face on his back.

“The tempering technique of demonic cultivator? It’s very strong, but your appearance did not affect my situation. Even if you let Seifer win, you won’t gain anything at your end. It’s only by turning the tables that you will gain the strength to stand firm in this Saint Kingdom.”

Li Yue shook his head, and the chessboard in his hand slowly enlarged.

“As the chosen one by Lord Shimoji, Sabas, what you mentioned is not what I need to consider. What I’m considering is not allowing any opportunities for the human race to take advantage of this war. That is my mission.” Sabas seemed to know the rules as well. A sinister smile appeared on his face.

He stomped his feet and charged toward Li Yue.

The black and white chess pieces fell off the chessboard, turning into waves of surging power that crashed into Sabas’s body.

The tremendous force smashed his body, creating a depression as the chess pieces deeply embedded themselves into the horrifying muscles.

Bursts of blood mist kept erupting from his body, but Sabas seemed unaffected. His speed did not slow down at all.

“Go to hell!”

He suddenly leaped above Li Yue, and his fist shot out like an arrow toward Li

Yue’s head.

There was even a faint sonic boom between the fists, and this power was far beyond that of the ogre.

“Chess game, dominate.”

Li Yue raised his head. The enormous chessboard was suddenly erected, and countless black and white chess pieces instantly covered the entire chessboard. The black pieces almost covered the entire chessboard, forming a dominating

game.

On the chessboard, the momentum of the game surged, and the immense force struck Sabas suddenly.

A look of disbelief appeared on his face. This inconspicuous youth with a buzz cut before him could actually unleash such terrifying power.

His body crashed onto the ground, and all his internal organs were shattered into minced meat.

Li Yue’s face was pale. Dominating the chess game had exhausted him greatly. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He did not stop and sped up toward the depths.

Along the way, massive information entered the mirror again.

Just as he had guessed, although these armies could be summoned continuously, they would affect Seifer’s condition..
