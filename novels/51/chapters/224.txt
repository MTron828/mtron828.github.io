The giant black ball grew bigger and bigger above Hui Ming’s head, and a terrifying pressure instantly spread out!

A serious look flashed across Jiang Gu’s face, and he immediately circulated his inner strength to protect his body.

On the other hand, Qin Yu’s expression was calm, and he didn’t take Hui Ming’s move seriously at all.

“Qin Yu, die!” Hui Ming roared angrily! Then, he pushed his palm forward!

The huge black ball rolled over with a rumbling sound. Wherever it touched was instantly shattered!

“What a simple trick. Watch me shatter it with one punch!” Qin Yu roared. He clenched his fist and faced it head-on!

“Boom!”

After a loud sound, Qin Yu’s fist instantly collided with the huge black ball!

The huge collision shattered the entire room into pieces!

Both sides were in a stalemate for a moment, and the black ball was unable to move closer!

“Break!”

Qin Yu roared! Cracks began to appear on the huge black ball!

“Boom!”

Finally, the black ball couldn’t take it anymore. In an instant, it turned into dark energy and spread out in all directions!

Qin Yu’s expression was cold. He looked at Hui Ming and sneered. “That’s it?”

Hui Ming licked his lips and sneered. “As expected of a chaotic body. To be honest, I’m getting more and more interested in you.”

“What exactly is the chaotic body you’re talking about?” Qin Yu frowned and asked.

This was the second time he had heard this term from Hui Ming.

“Go to h*ll to ask about it!” Hui Ming roared, and the black ball in his palm appeared again! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Again?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

Hui Ming knew that this spell was ineffective, but he still persisted. What was the point?

“Hahaha, even if you can withstand one, what about ten?” Hui Ming laughed crazily!

Then, he pushed the black ball out of his hand, and another black ball condensed!

“Huh?” Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly, and shock flashed in his eyes.

This technique consumed a lot of energy, but Hui Ming could throw out one black ball after another!

Could it be that his physical strength was infinite?

“Boom!”

Several black balls exploded beside Qin Yu’s ears at the same time! He felt like his eardrum was shattered!

Even Qin Yu’s ears were bleeding!

“This can’t go on.” Qin Yu’s expression turned cold as he took large strides forward!

Magi weren’t good at close combat, but were good at using spells. Hence, he couldn’t allow Hui Ming to stand at a far distance!

Whoosh!

Qin Yu turned into a ray of golden light and arrived in front of Hui Ming in an instant.

A huge fist smashed towards Hui Ming with a crushing force!

“Want to get close? I’m not afraid of you. This body isn’t inferior to yours!” Hui Ming snorted coldly and actually clenched his fist to meet the fist head-on!

“Clang!”

The sound of the two fists colliding was deafening. Waves of sound waves spread out in all directions while shattering the entire house!

“Bam!”

Hui Ming retreated again after again, and the bones in his hands were broken!

The powerful inner strength even penetrated his entire arm, and the bones were almost shattered!

“How is this possible?!” Hui Ming grimaced in pain.

He lowered his head to look at his arms, then his face was full of shock!

This body was the toughest that Hui Ming had ever seen, but in front of Qin Yu, there was actually no room for resistance!

“Bang!”

Another punch came right at his face!

With this punch, Hui Ming’s entire body was sent flying!

Qin Yu didn’t stop there. He kept throwing powerful punches at him!

In the blink of an eye, Hui Ming had already withstood dozens of punches!

All the bones in his body were smashed into pieces!

“Did he win?” Jiang Gu, who wasn’t far away, muttered in a low voice.

As soon as he finished speaking, Hui Ming’s body slowly healed again!

In just a few minutes, Hui Ming’s body was as good as new!

“Huh?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows slightly.

He rubbed his chin and thought for a moment, then muttered, “So that’s how it is. I understand...”

“Hahaha! Qin Yu, you can’t kill me! But I can slowly exhaust you to death!” Hui Ming laughed crazily.

Qin Yu sneered. “I’ve already guessed it.”

“You’ve guessed it?” Hui Ming sneered.

“You keep boasting shamelessly! How can an ant-like you guess the ultimate technique of the Earth Fiend Valley?” Hui Ming sneered.

Qin Yu glanced around and said indifferently, “At first, I thought you had some unimaginable technique that could heal you quickly, but later, I realized it didn’t seem like it.”

“That was until I saw your endless internal qi and... When you recovered your body, you recovered together with the collapsed house. I confirmed my guess.”

When he heard Qin Yu’s words, Jiang Gu quickly looked around.

Sure enough, the house that had just been shattered was actually intact!

Hui Ming sneered. “You have keen observation.”

Qin Yu ignored Hui Ming and continued to guess, “In other words, you have an immortal body here, right?”

“That’s right,” Hui Ming said with a nonchalant smile.

“This spell is quite wondrous,” Qin Yu sighed.

It seemed that the Earth Fiend Valley lived up to its reputation.

“So what if you guessed it? I can slowly exhaust your physical strength. When your internal qi is exhausted, you will die!” Hui Ming said with a cold smile.

As he spoke, Hui Ming’s palm moved again.

In an instant, a violent wind blew. A huge black figure actually condensed behind his back!

What shocked Qin Yu was that the appearance of this black figure was precisely that of the ancestor within the stone statue!

“Qin Yu, obediently sacrifice your physical body for the ancestor!” Hui Ming’s voice boomed like thunder and was deafening to the ears.

Qin Yu raised his head to look at this huge figure and said coldly, “If you want to beat me with this technique, then I’m afraid you miscalculated.”

“Hahaha! Sharp-tongued brat, you’re boasting shamelessly! This is the ultimate technique of the Earth Fiend Valley. With a single palm, I can smash a small mountain!” Hui Ming roared.

“No matter how tough your body is, I can still smash you into minced meat!”

“Die!”

With that said, Hui Ming activated his spell, and the huge figure started to move.

He raised his huge palm, and with a rolling force, he pressed it towards Qin Yu!

In an instant, the entire ground seemed to be on the verge of shattering!

Even Jiang Gu, who wasn’t far away, felt pain in his chest from the pressure, and he spat out a mouthful of blood!

“This isn’t good!” Jiang Gu thought to himself.

Even he might not be able to withstand the strike of this palm!

The ground beneath Qin Yu’s feet began to collapse, and his entire body sank several times!

“This simple trick isn’t worth mentioning. I’ll smash your head right now!” Qin Yu didn’t panic at all.

He snorted coldly, and his entire body instantly turned golden!

Golden light surged along his body before finally condensing on his two fists!

“Immemorial sacred spring!”

Along with Qin Yu’s furious roar, the light on his fists instantly became as dazzling as the sun!

“Smash it!” Qin Yu clenched his fists, and his body soared into the air before ruthlessly pouncing over!
