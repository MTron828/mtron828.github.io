Chapter 2579: The Inexplicable Counterattack

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s fist landed on these blood scabs, and obviously, they had absorbed some of the power and caused the power transmitted to the bodies of the monster race to decrease significantly.

“Haha, this brat’s physical strength is not weak and seemed to have absorbed a lot of holy energy! Quickly and kill this brat.”

Demonic Flame’s eyes lit up, and his breathing quickened.

The way he and Faint Radiance looked at Qin Yu was like a hungry wolf staring at its prey.

The two immediately attacked Qin Yu like a storm. With the advantage of their bodies, they did not hesitate even if they were injured.

In less than five minutes, many wounds appeared on Qin Yu’s body.

Blood seeped out from these wounds continuously. Qin Yu felt his control over his body slowly weakened.

“Bang!”

Faint Radiance leaped, his monster body arching like a bow.

Leveraging the power of his body, he forcefully drove a knee onto Q’s back.

His knee was covered in a thick layer of blood scab, and when he clashed with Qin Yu’s back, it instantly tore apart.

His body, struck by this immense force, staggered with a jolt.

“Haha, go to hell, Brat!”

Demonic Flame rushed over with a sinister smile, wanting to smash Qin Yu’s head directly.

“Pfft!”

He heard a strange sound that seemed transmitted from his body to his ears.

At this moment, Qin Yu was holding a dagger that seemed to be made of bone, thrusting it from his ribcage and then diagonally upward, severing all of his internal organs and his heart directly.

His fist landed on Qin Yu’s head, and he lost most of his strength.

“Save me!”

Demonic Flame let out a trembling cry.

He noticed with the rupture of his internal organs, his soul began to weaken to the point that he could not even control himself, and his hands raised voluntarily.

In an instant, Qin Yu felt a gentle force enter his soul.

His body, which seemed heavy due to the previous injury, became slightly lighter. His injuries improved as the Saint power entered his body.

“It’s your turn now.”

Qin Yu stared at Faint Radiance before him, sneered, and said.

“Wait, how did you see through the weakness of the Demonic Flame’s body? There’s something strange about your eyes. Why are you able to cast technique here?”

Faint Radiance looked at the eyes on Qin Yu’s forehead and exclaimed with a hint of terror.

“Ask when you’re in hell!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

A cold light flashed in Qin Yu’s eyes.

Their bodies appeared translucent in front of him, and the weakest points of their Saint power were their most vulnerable spots.

Furthermore, their movements would also slow down a little under the gaze of the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze. This had given Qin Yu an advantage in sieging the two.

Under the intimidation of this pair of eyes, Faint Radiance began to feel on edge, afraid that Qin Yu would instantly kill him.

The injuries on his body became more, and his soul visibly weakened.

“Lord Dark Heart, quickly save me! I can’t hold on any longer.” Faint Radiance shouted.

“If you don’t want to die, fight him with all your might.”

The other monster race stared coldly at the battle as if he had no intention of interfering.

“Are you waiting for the right opportunity? It’s better for me.”

Although Qin Yu was fighting with Faint Radiance, his Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze had been staring at Dark Heart.

This monster race was actually slowly retreating without any action of support.

“Go to hell!”

Qin Yu forcefully withstood the knee attack of Faint Radiance and stabbed the dagger into his heart.

Faint Radiance collapsed on the ground. A ball of gas came out of his soul and slowly drifted into Qin Yu’s soul.

At this moment, an intense throbbing sensation suddenly surged on Qin Yu’s forehead.

A stinging pain erupted in his divine sense. After that, the eyes on his forehead slowly closed and disappeared from Qin Yu’s forehead.

‘Your pupils seem only last for a short period. Your ability to find the vulnerable spots of Demonic Flame and Faint Radiance has something to do with this pair of eyes. Furthermore, your eyes seemed able to predict your next move. ”

Dark Heart, who had been retreating, stopped.

“But now, this eye has disappeared.”

A cylindrical bone had appeared in his hand at some point in time. The tip of the bone had been sharpened.

He forged the bone into something resembling a spear. It was their first day in the Saint Kingdom, and having such a weapon was considered not bad at all.

So fast!

Dark Heart started sprinting, and his speed was exceptionally fast. It was so fast that afterimages seemed to be appearing before his eyes.

“He must have used all the power he had devoured to strengthen his legs!”

In an instant, the spear pierced through the air, emitting a sharp whistling sound.

Unavoidable!

Qin Yu fiercely pointed the dagger in his hand at the tip of the spear.

“Crack!’

Under the impact of that terrifying speed, Qin Yu’s arm emitted a crisp sound.

This terrifying force directly fractured his right arm.

“Whoosh!”

Dark Heart did not give Qin Yu any time to catch his breath. The bone spike in his hand seemed to have turned into a spear.

He charged toward Qin Yu again, aiming for his vital spot.

“Pfft!”

Qin Yu barely avoided the bone spike that was rushing toward his heart, and it pierced through the side of his body.

The massive force instantly shattered several of Qin Yu’s ribs. Dark Heart’s attack was fast and precise, full of destructive power.

In terms of strength and speed, he had the upper hand. With just two attacks, he had caused tremendous damage to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s heart sank.

He noticed while his blood was flowing out, his power of the soul began to weaken, and the power that controlled his body began to drain, just like the Demonic Flame and Faint Radiance just now.

“Go to hell!”

The bone spike in his hand again stabbed at Qin Yu’s head like lightning.

The speed and power of this attack increased once again.

Earlier, Dark Heart had actually retained some strength when he attacked. He was probably afraid that Qin Yu still had a backup plan.

At this moment, seeing that the two spears had attacked successfully, Dark Heart no longer held back.

The bone spike in his hand had gathered his greatest strength. The bone spike contained some kind of killing intent.

“D*mn! I can’t dodge it!”

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. The sudden acceleration of the bone spike did not allow him to react in time at all.

“Boom!”

The bone spike directly pierced through his head.

“Village Chief, please save Little Brother. He has just saved us. I beg you!” The boy’s body trembled as he hid behind the old man.

Beside them, a young man who reeked of alcohol had appeared at some point in time. His hair was messy and vaguely had some hair oil on it. He seemed to have not washed his hair for many days.

“Gulp! Gulp! Hongyu, are you calling me?”

The young man was stunned for a moment before he reacted.

“He’s fine, he’s fine. Little Brother will come back to life soon.” The village chief rubbed his red nose and said perfunctorily..
