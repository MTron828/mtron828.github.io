Chapter 2665: Power Outside the Saint Kingdom

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

In an instant, the entire area under his feet was engulfed in Black Lotus Fire, a flame that emitted no heat and lacked any divine might.

However, as the flames ignited, the divination sword slowly began to melt.

“What the hell!”

Hua Tian was shocked. He had never seen such a terrifying phenomenon before.

This divination was formed by the power of rules, yet it was directly melted by the Black Lotus Fire.

“No divine might. This isn’t the power of the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom!”

Hua Tian suddenly felt a sense of impending death as the Black Lotus engulfed his body.

It seeped into his pores, forming a deathly flame in his sea of consciousness. “Buddha Wu Tian, spare me! I just wanted to test my strength!”

Hua Tian’s expression changed drastically. His entire body was covered in cold sweat as he immediately knelt and kowtowed three times.

Like a poisonous snake, the flame in his sea of consciousness shook slowly before eventually extinguishing.

“Your power here is nothing but child’s play in my eyes. Do your own thing and don’t think you’re clever.”

Wu Tian’s voice slowly became ethereal.

Hua Tian lay on the ground, not daring to move for a long time.

Only when there was no fluctuation in the surroundings did he dare to slowly raise his head.

“What a terrifying individual. This energy doesn’t belong to the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom, yet it can traverse the entire world and descend here. Moreover, I couldn’t even muster the strength to resist. What terrifying power is this?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Hua Tian’s voice trembled, and the fear on his face was palpable.

Even at his peak, he couldn’t put up a fight against Wu Tian.

If it wasn’t for the fact that he was useful to him, he would likely be dead by now.

Hua Tian couldn’t help but feel a lingering fear. His expression suddenly lit up.

Didn’t Wu Tian give him a Black Lotus before? It seemed he needed to study it carefully.

Even if it was just a Black Lotus clone, if it truly contained Wu Tian’s power, it would likely be extremely terrifying.

Moreover, since he couldn’t afford to offend him, he had to serve him well.

In any case, given that individual’s strength, he likely doesn’t belong to the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom, so he doesn’t pose any conflict of interest with me.

Thinking this through, Hua Tian finally relaxed.

Considering that he hadn’t sensed any danger before, Wu Tian wasn’t a threat to him.

“Buddha Wu Tian, have you managed to break through the suppression of Saint Power?” Pang De asked eagerly.

He had been Wu Tian’s disciple since his early years. Now that Wu Tian had recovered, he was filled with joy.

If Wu Tian could bring him out of this Saint Kingdom, he would not have to suffer from this suppression any more.

“The power of two arms is enough for me to resist this power. The power of a

Saint Kingdom won’t be able to affect me much right now. Furthermore, Hua Tian’s Heart of Saint Kingdom isn’t very powerful, so the power it can summon isn’t enough to pose a threat to me.”

“If that’s the case, why don’t we just kill the person designated by the Emerald Serpent Witch directly? Why bother involving this monk? I sense a strong sense of malice from him, and he doesn’t seem like a good partner for cooperation. ”

“He’s the person designated by the Emerald Serpent Witch. The Heart of Saint Kingdom on his body emits a dangerous aura. He shouldn’t possess such power, or perhaps he’s a contingency plan left by the previous Lord of the Saint Kingdom. I’m on the brink of awakening now, so I can’t afford to encounter even the slightest danger, and I can’t waste any of my power,” Wu Tian explained slowly.

“As for Hua Tian, he’s nothing more than an ant. The source of his providence is very close to this place, which is why he was able to suppress the person designated by the Emerald Serpent Witch. Regardless of what happens next, he’s not aligned with our goals. His task is to suppress Qin Yu and eliminate him. As for everything else, it’s not worth our attention. I believe that after teaching him a lesson this time, he will understand this principle.” Pang De nodded in agreement, and together with Wu Tian, they left the area.

At this moment, Qin Yu, Ling’er, and Jing Xin were wandering in the Demon Sealing Valley.

It was unclear whether Elder Xin Yue had given instructions or if Ling’er was simply being playful.

With the assistance of the Wings of Clear Winds, they had traversed nearly every corner of the Demon Sealing Valley.

Qin Yu witnessed various spectacles and encountered numerous peculiar cultivation sites.

“What a marvelous place, the Demon Sealing Valley. Your valley master is truly a remarkable individual. The design of this place surpasses the imagination of ordinary folk. If this expansive area was indeed crafted by him, then he is undoubtedly a prodigious talent.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but praise. Even now, he remained unaware of how the natives of the Saint Kingdom came into existence.

If they were similar to what he had observed in the village before, these natives were born from the essence of heaven and earth. In that case, individuals like the village chief and the valley master belonged to the first wave of native beings. This explained their formidable strength.

As the essence of the Saint Kingdom diminished, subsequent living beings would gradually weaken.

But where did these ordinary living beings originate?

Could such a vast life technique be nurtured by the heavens and the earth? This transcended mere creation, even a saint-tier expert would likely be unable to achieve it.

The enigma of the Saint Kingdom far exceeded his imagination.

Many aspects remained incomprehensible to him.

Jing Xin, Linger, and even Elder Xin Yue were involved, yet despite consulting them, Qin Yu couldn’t discern the key point.

Suddenly, a sense of alarm surged within Qin Yu’s heart. The two Hearts of the Saint Kingdom within his body began to tremble uncontrollably.

The two internal qi abruptly merged with Qin Yu’s soul power. In an instant, Qin Yu sensed a dark power infiltrating the Saint Kingdom and descending upon the Ancient Demon Land surrounding the Demon Sealing Valley.

Before him, the Black Lotus Fire raged furiously.

Even the mere presence of that aura caused Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness to burn with agonizing pain.

“Is this an external force breaching the Saint Kingdom? And this power feels familiar. It seems akin to Wu Tian’s power, yet far more potent than before!” Qin Yu was profoundly unsettled.

The power embodied by the Hearts of the Saint Kingdom originated from the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom. Hence, Qin Yu could immediately discern this force, which did not belong to the Saint Kingdom.

Not only vigilance but also panic!

Qin Yu gasped in astonishment. The force capable of inducing panic in the Hearts of Saint Kingdom originated from beyond the Saint Kingdom.

Just how formidable was this power to elicit such a response from the Hearts of Saint Kingdom? Moreover, this marked the first instance of Qin Yu sensing an external force intruding since his arrival in the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom..”
