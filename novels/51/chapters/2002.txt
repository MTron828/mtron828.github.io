2003 Deliberately Concealed Landform

In the end, Qin Yu did not have the heart to ignore her. Without further delay, he immediately activated the line word formula and rushed toward the third princess!

“Qin Yu!” Seeing this scene, Jue Wu was even more anxious. She could not abandon Qin Yu.

Therefore, without hesitation, she immediately followed him closely.

The third princess on the ground was scared out of her wits, and the strange phenomenon underground was getting even more intense. A second impact could erupt at any time.

Stepping on the line word formula, Qin Yu rushed toward the third princess incredibly fast!

“Buzz!”

At the same time, the second impact on the ground erupted!

Terrifying air currents gushed out from the ground. Compared to the first time, it was even more violent and horrifying!

“Boom!”

Rays of light beam shot into the sky and were fast approaching the third princess!

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. In desperation, he picked up the third princess and dragged her up with both hands!

At the same time, Qin Yu’s body emitted the Golden Light. The internal qi all over his body was like a layer of armor wrapping around him!

Jue Wu, who had wanted to rush over, was obviously too late. She could only stand in the sky and fixed her eyes on Qin Yu!

“Jue Wu, catch her!” Qin Yu roared. He exerted strength with both hands and threw the third princess into the sky!

The third princess flew into the air under Qin Yu’s strength, but Qin Yu was not as lucky. Rays of light beam rushed into his back, erupting incredibly terrifying power!

“Boom!”

The entire area turned into ashes instantly, and the smoke and dust obscured the vision. No one could see clearly what had happened!

Jue Wu hugged the third princess and stared in Qin Yu’s direction. Her face was ashen.

“Qin Yu!” Jue Wu shouted. Her heart trembled violently and was full of worry. At the same time, it aroused her anger!

“It’s all your fault!” Jue Wu gritted his teeth and looked at the third princess. “Let me tell you, if anything happens to Qin Yu, I will definitely tear you into shreds!”

The third princess did not dare to say anything. She could not help but look in Qin Yu’s direction. She, who had always been selfish, indeed had a worried expression.

The smoke and dust slowly dispersed, and the scene below finally displayed in front of Jue Wu.

Qin Yu’s body was wrapped in Golden Light. However, under the impact of the powerful air current, the Golden Light was torn apart. There were even more wounds on Qin Yu’s body.

“Qin Yu!”

Jue Wu couldn’t care about anything else and hurriedly rushed toward Qin Yu.

Qin Yu shook his body and stood up from the ground. He felt the pain faintly come from his back.

“Fortunately, nothing happened,” Qin Yu turned around and said.

Even though his back was bleeding, it wasn’t a severe injury, so it wasn’t a big problem.

Jue Wu hurriedly raised her small hand and placed it on Qin Yu’s body, transmitting her internal qi to him.

“I’m fine.” Qin Yu shook his head. “Let’s leave this place quickly. No one can guarantee there won’t be a third time.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Mmm,” Jue Wu responded. She glared at the third princess and reprimanded, “You’re lucky!”

Qin Yu didn’t say much. He quickly rushed into the distance according to the direction he had deduced.

And Jue Wu carried the third princess and followed closely behind.

This land was tremendously strange. Qin Yu could still feel numerous internal qi staring at him in the dark.

But when Qin Yu wanted to probe, he could not capture the specific location of the internal qi.

“I’m afraid this internal qi isn’t real,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

This internal qi was probably not from a specific person but from this land, just like the demonic qi that gave birth to the terrifying green monster.

After moving forward for a long time, the surrounding internal qi finally dimmed slightly. The wound on Qin Yu’s back still made him bleed non-stop.

“Let’s rest for a while first.” Jue Wu frowned.

Although the wound was on the surface, it would probably cause problems if the bleeding did not stop in time.

Seeing no danger in the surroundings, Qin Yu nodded and agreed.

He sat cross-legged on the ground and slowly adjusted his internal qi.

Jue Wu walked to the back of Qin Yu. Using her spiritual energy that was somehow abnormal, she transmitted her internal qi to Qin Yu.

As the wound healed, pain spread throughout his body.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but gasp, and his face was full of sweat.

“Hiss!”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and endured the pain.

Not far away, the third princess, lying on the ground, looked at Qin Yu quietly.

Confusion filled her eyes as if she did not understand why Qin Yu wanted to save her.

After a long time, the injuries on Qin Yu’s body slowly healed. Jue Wu also stopped transmitting his internal qi.

“If you dare to do this again, I’ll beat you to death!” Jue Wu waved her small fists and said fiercely.

“I’m okay,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

“It’ll be too late if something happens! You’re a lunatic!” Jue Wu muttered unhappily.

After saying that, she grabbed the third princess over and stood beside Qin Yu. She looked around vigilantly like a little bodyguard.

...

Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly and slowly adjusted his internal qi.

“Why did you save me?” At this moment, the third princess finally could not help but ask.

“I’ve promised Elder Si to keep you safe,” Qin Yu glanced at her and said.

“Just because you’ve promised him?” The third princess frowned.

“Otherwise?” Qin Yu asked.

The third princess opened her mouth, not knowing what to say.

The third princess had never kept her promise on Xihuang Island for many years. To her, everyone in this world seemed to be the same.

But today, Qin Yu risked his life to save her, which seemed to have impacted her inherent beliefs.

After a while, the injuries on Qin Yu’s body were almost healed.

He stood up and said, “Jue Wu, let’s go.”

“Mmm,” Jue Wu responded. She said in a deep voice, “There’s something strange about this place. We have to be careful.”

...

At this moment, Qin Yu had a different thought. He smiled and said, “If this place is really dangerous, why would those creatures choose this side and not the safer area on the other side?”

“Also, the skeleton in that house doesn’t look like it has any injuries. However, it passed away on the spot. Does this mean the real danger is hiding on the other side?”

Qin Yu’s words instantly made Jue Wu somewhat dumbfounded.

She waved impatiently and said, “What are you talking about? I don’t understand, and I don’t want to hear it. As long as nothing happens.”

Qin Yu smiled but did not say anything else. In fact, he already had this thought in her mind just now.

The light beams that soared into the sky seemed tremendously terrifying. They could even easily break through Qin Yu and Jue Wu’s defenses. However, when he came into contact with them, they did not have the terrifying lethality he had imagined.
