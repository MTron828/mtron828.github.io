Chapter 888: Chapter 888, the birth of the martial saint! 

Qin Yu suddenly stood up from the ground and stared at the strange phenomenon in the sky.

Yan Ruoxue was also attracted by such auspicious clouds.

Soon, the auspicious clouds began to disappear and were replaced by large patches of dark clouds.

“Crack!”

Then, a thunder was heard!

This thunder was deafening as if it was going to split the ground in half!

Although Qin Yu did not know what this phenomenon was, he had a very bad feeling in his heart.

“Someone is going to step into the martial saint realm,”Li Yu said from the side.

Qin Yu’s expression suddenly changed!

What he was afraid of came true!

He did not expect that someone was really going to step into the martial saint realm ahead of Time!

“Li Yu, you must speed up, Please!”Qin Yu looked at Li Yu with a pleading look in his eyes.

Li Yu also nodded and said, “Don’t worry, in a day at most, I will definitely let you hide in the secret realm.”

Such a heaven and earth phenomenon naturally attracted countless people.

The many aristocratic families in the martial arts world almost all saw the strangeness of this phenomenon.

Jingdu, in a certain villa.

Ye Qing raised his head to look at this phenomenon and said in a low voice, “Someone has stepped into the martial saint realm.”

Southwest, a deserted area.

Jiang he was also attracted by this strange phenomenon. He said with a trembling voice, “After so many years... finally, someone has stepped into the martial saint realm...”

Many old monsters who had been stuck at the half-step martial saint realm for many years also opened their eyes at this moment.

“Someone has stepped into the Martial Saint Realm! This is enough to prove that the current era can already give birth to a martial saint!”

This was the carnival of countless people! To the martial arts world, this was undoubtedly good news!

At this moment, under a certain island, a young man walked out from the main gate of the immortal slaying sect.

He had a noble temperament, but there was an uncomfortable coldness to him.

Behind him, there were dozens of corpses!

This person was none other than Tian Xuehong!

“Finally... someone has become a martial saint,”Tian Xuehong murmured.

“Haha... hahahahaha!”A moment later, Tian Xuehong’s smile spread across the entire sea area.

Inside the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, the Pavilion Master’s face was filled with worry as he muttered, “Once a martial saint is born, the agreement between the DAO protectors will no longer exist.”

“Qin Yu, you must hide well...”

...

In the second secret realm.

Gu Xinghe was lying on the bed like a dead dog.

This time, his injuries were even more serious. He did not even have the strength to speak.

All the bones in his body were cracked. Just the recovery of his body alone would take a long time.

Looking at Gu Xinghe’s appearance, Gu Zizhen could not help but turn pale.

“It’s fine if you lost face once, but you can F * cking lose it a second time!”Gu Zizhen could not help but curse.

He couldn’t figure out why he had to go over and take a beating since he was no match for Qin Yu.

Gu Xinghe endured the pain in his body. He used all his strength and said in a low voice, “Kill... kill... Qin Yu...”

Gu Zizhen snorted coldly, “You should rest well. You’re lucky that you didn’t die this time. You Don’t have to worry about Qin Yu anymore.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Then, Gu Zizhen stood up and walked out.

As soon as he entered the hall, long brows rushed in.

“Master, Good News! Good News!”Long brows said excitedly.

“Someone has become a martial saint!”

Gu Zizhen suddenly stood up and said in surprise, “Is what you said true?”

“It’s absolutely true! I saw the martial saint’s abnormal phenomenon with my own eyes!”Long brows’excited voice trembled slightly.

Gu Zizhen narrowed his eyes slightly.

He sneered and said, “Good, good. The restriction of the Dao Protector... has finally disappeared. hahahaha!”

“Go, Call Zhai Xing over for me!”

After a few minutes, Zhai Xing appeared in the main hall.

Gu Zizhen arranged for Zhai Xing to bring the two martial saints out of the second secret realm to kill Qin Yu!

At the same time, the Wan family had also issued the same order!

Wan guqiong would lead the two martial saints out of the Wan family to kill Qin Yu and Snatch Yan Ruoxue!

Each secret realm had sent out their martial saints one after another. Their only target was Qin Yu!

At this moment, Qin Yu was sitting near the spiritual spring and waiting quietly.

“I wonder who has become a martial saint.”Qin Yu’s heart was in a mess.

This time, someone had stepped into the martial saint realm. It was likely that it would change the entire structure of the martial arts world.

Qin Yu looked at Li Yu and said, “Mr. Li, how much more time does this mystic realm need?”

Li Yu said, “Two hours.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “Okay.”

He sat there, quietly waiting for the opening of the mystic realm.

Two hours passed very quickly, and in the blink of an eye, it was gone.

It happened to be stuck in two hours, and rays of light flashed in front of Li Yu.

Then, a huge entrance appeared in front of Qin Yu.

“It’s Open!”Li Yu said with faint excitement.

Qin Yu nodded to him and said, “Give me the secret key.”

Li Yu did not waste any time and immediately passed the secret key to Qin Yu.

Following that, Qin Yu looked at Yan Ruoxue and said, “Ruoxue, you go in first.”

“What About You?”Yan Ruoxue said with some confusion.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “I have to go to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

If they could not find Qin Yu, they might vent their anger on the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

Qin Yu owed the pavilion master too much. He would not allow the pavilion master to be implicated because of this.

Yan Ruoxue was a woman who knew the big picture. She also knew that Qin Yu had to go.

Therefore, she did not say too much nonsense. She just reminded him to be careful before entering the mystic realm.

After Yan Ruoxue entered the mystic realm, Qin Yu looked at Li Yu.

“Mr. Li, you...”

“You want me to go with you, right?”Li Yu interrupted Qin Yu’s words.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “How did you know?”

Li Yu said, “Because you were worried that I would spread the location of the Mystic Realm.”

“Yes.”Qin Yu did not hide anything.

“I’ll go with you.”Li Yu surprisingly agreed.

“Thank you for understanding.”Qin Yu cupped his hands. Then, he brought Li Yu quickly towards Qinghe town.

...

Jingdu martial arts association, exit of the second secret realm.

Zhai Xing suddenly appeared with three martial saints.

“TSK TSK, it’s been a long time since I’ve left the Second Secret Realm.”Someone beside Zhai Xing sighed.

“Yeah, it’s been a hundred years. It’s all that Guardian’s fault.”Another person also sighed.

Zhai Xing glanced at them and said, “You should be happy that you haven’t died in a hundred years.”

When this topic was brought up, the three of them could not help but shiver.

The scene of countless martial saints dying tragically a hundred years ago was still vivid in their minds.

“Don’t waste time. Go and find Qin Yu,”Zhai Xing said coldly.

On the other side, on a certain high mountain, Wan Gu Qiong walked out with two martial saints.

“Qin Yu... has finally waited for this day.”Wan Gu Qiong took a deep breath as a trace of viciousness flashed across his face.
