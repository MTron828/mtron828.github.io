Dan’s smile slowly faded.

Gu Yi’s expression changed drastically. Looking at the expressionless face in front of him, he felt like his body had fallen into an ice cave.

“I overstepped.”

Gu Yi sat cross-legged on the ground, his hands upright, and the front half of his body lying on the ground.

The anger on Dan’s face eased a little when he saw Gu Yi make the same apology gesture as he did in the Demon Sealing Valley. In the heavens and the earth, among all living beings.

Who could completely escape fate?

Dan sat on the cushion again. “The Demon Sealing Valley was born because of this Saint Kingdom, and our duties were derived from the ancient demon here. This is our destiny. As for us, we can only strive within the scope of our fate.”

Dan looked at the people sitting down and raised his wrinkled eyelids.

His turbid eyes swept across the crowd before he asked with a smile.

“Gu Yi, Xin Yue, do you understand what I mean?”

The two of them were a little puzzled, but Xin Yue still subconsciously replied.

“I’m ignorant. Please enlighten me, Valley Master.”

“The Holy Lord has already died. This is an indisputable fact. If we can find a new Holy Lord, perhaps the fate of the Demon Sealing Valley can be resolved.” Dan said softly.

“How difficult. The vastness of the Saint Kingdom is unimaginable. Not only have outsiders entered this place, but many living beings have also entered from the Saint Realm. It’s really difficult to tell who will become the ruler of this world in the end.”

Gu Yi said with a bitter smile. They had seen too many heaven-defying geniuses fall in the Demon Sealing Valley.

In this world, there was no lack of geniuses.

“However, with so many geniuses in this Saint Kingdom, we can only do our best and leave it to fate.”

Dan’s face lit up.

“This time, I accidentally sensed a ray of light while cultivating. This person’s cultivation technique is connected to my Daoist path. Moreover, he is currently in our Demon Sealing Valley.”

“Who is it?”

Gu Yi and Xin Yue asked at the same time.

“I’m not sure at the moment. The power he cultivates has a connection with my cultivation technique, but if I make a move, I can determine it. Once we find this person, the Demon Sealing Valley will use all our strength to assist him. For now, for the future, we will seize the last chance of survival. Furthermore, I remember that the Demon Sealing Valley’s Dao Competition which happens every fifty years will be held shortly. Perhaps this is also the will of the heavens.”

After saying that, Dan closed his eyes and stopped talking to the others.

Gu Yi and the others left slowly, and the atmosphere between the elders of the two sects became much more harmonious.

This time, the valley master’s sudden return had also pointed them in the right direction. They could also put aside the conflict between them.

At this moment, Hua Tian, who was immersed in cultivation within the Demon Sealing Valley, suddenly opened his eyes. His pupils sparkled with delight.

In that fleeting moment, he felt a surge of immense thunderous power coursing through him.

It infused into the depths of his soul from the void, eliciting a transformative baptism upon his divine essence once again.

Every minuscule aspect of his divine soul underwent an ineffable change. The Saint Power stored within his divine soul unexpectedly reentered his already maximized divine essence, further augmenting the might of his soul power.

“Excellent, this will firmly stabilize my True Consciousness Realm. The power I just sensed seems to be feedback from the Great Expansion Divine Technique. My fortune surged momentarily. Could it be that something favorable has occurred within the Demon Sealing Valley?”

After assessing the alterations within his divine soul, Hua Tian began meticulously conjecturing the recent events.

“It appears Wu Tian was correct. This must indeed be the location where my fortune has skyrocketed.”

Hua Tian chuckled.

He employed his Heavenly Eye to once again inspect his cosmic luck. At present, the potency of his fortune was overwhelmingly imposing, entirely subduing everyone present, including Qin Yu.

Compared to his prior exertions, this bout of cosmic luck was akin to an unstoppable tidal force.

“There must have been recent changes in the Demon Sealing Valley. When the time comes, I’ll contemplate it thoroughly. With this unprecedented fortune, I’m afraid nothing within this place can withstand me.”

Hua Tian laughed heartily.

Outside the dwelling, a congregation of magpies had assembled, their jubilant chirping resounding.

According to folklore, “crows herald misfortune, while magpies announce good tidings.” Encountering magpies was indeed a rare occurrence.

Witnessing this spectacle, Hua Tian’s countenance brimmed with elation.

At this moment, his thoughts flowed freely, and myriad cultivation quandaries between the Human Consciousness and the True Consciousness seemed to resolve themselves in an instant.

“My friend Hua Tian? Are you faring well in this abode?”

At this moment, Gu Yi, garbed in a yellow robe, abruptly pushed open the door and entered. He had just witnessed the scene of magpies chirping outside.

A look of perplexity adorned his face. Within the confines of the Demon Sealing Valley, he had never before witnessed such a phenomenon of magpies chirping.

In that moment, it seemed as though he had grasped something significant.

Pinching his fingers, he attuned himself to the energies of the place.

“Thanks to you, my friend, I’m faring quite well,” Hua Tian replied, patting his rotund belly. He had been subdued by Gu Yi’s faction and incarcerated within this location.

“Haha, my disciples have failed to grasp my intentions. I apologize for the inconvenience,” Gu Yi offered, bowing slightly.

“Naturally, I shall offer compensation for any grievances you may have endured. Please do not harbor ill feelings, ” he added softly.

Hua Tian regarded Gu Yi with surprise. Despite their prior interactions, he had not expected Gu Yi to proactively extend an apology.

“What form of compensation does Elder Gu Yi have in mind?” Hua Tian inquired eagerly, his eyes alight with anticipation. After all, it would be remiss not to capitalize on the benefits presented before him.

“My friend, it appears you’ve recently achieved a breakthrough. You require a substantial infusion of Saint Power to fortify your divine soul and physique. Take this token and venture into Langya Pavilion to vanquish some ancient demons imprisoned within. This will serve to bolster your physical form,” Gu Yi explained as he tossed a nameplate toward Hua Tian.

“Additionally, the upcoming fifty-year Dao Competition of the Demon Sealing Valley is on the horizon. Should any of my disciples encounter you, rest assured, I shall ensure your safe passage. Furthermore, the rewards garnered from this competition will significantly augment your strength. In the event of any unforeseen circumstances, I, Gu Yi, pledge to personally assist in their resolution,” he concluded.

Hua Tian’s countenance shifted, expressing gratitude. “In that case, I extend mv thanks to Elder Gu Yi in advance.”

Following Gu Yi’s departure, another figure emerged beside Hua Tian, Gu Tian.

Having gleaned the full extent of the situation from his master, Gu Tian voiced his concerns with a solemn demeanor.

“Master, are we not placing too much trust in Hua Tian? What if he is not the individual we seek?”

“In this world, nothing is absolute, particularly concerning the position of the Lord of the Saint Kingdom. Even Valley Master Dan cannot be certain, let alone us,” Gu Yi responded sagely..
