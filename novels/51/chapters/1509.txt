Chapter 1510: Chapter 1,510, inviting all the major sects

The first elder’s body had not yet recovered. He had already suffered heavy injuries repeatedly, and he looked like an old man in his twilight years. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“First Elder.”The vice sect master also greeted the first elder.

The first elder looked at the vice sect master coldly and said, “Do you have the final say in this heavenly cloud sect? Do you have the final say?”

The vice sect leader remained silent, but he seemed to have guessed what first elder was going to say next, so his expression was not very good.

First Elder put his hands behind his back with great difficulty. He swept his gaze across the crowd and slowly said, “I agree with everyone’s suggestion to negotiate with the northern lands.”

Once these words were said, the vice sect leader’s expression instantly became extremely ugly.

The many elders present laughed.

“Did you hear that? The first elder has spoken. What else do you have to say?”

“That’s right. Don’t forget that the first elder is the true acting sect leader.”

“Since the first elder has spoken, deputy sect leader, there’s nothing for you to persist on.”

Everyone requested to withdraw from the border and give up on resisting the northern lands.

Just as everyone was conversing, the deputy sect leader’s eyes suddenly flashed with viciousness.

In the next second, he suddenly extended his hand and slapped the first elder’s Back!

......

The first elder suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood. He turned around with great difficulty and glared at the vice sect leader as if he wanted to say something.

However, before he could say anything, he directly laid down.

Seeing this scene, everyone’s expressions couldn’t help but change greatly!

“Vice sect leader, what do you mean by this! Are you trying to rebel! ?”

“You actually attacked the first elder! Have you gone mad! ?”

“First Elder, are you alright! ?”

The vice sect leader coldly swept his gaze across the crowd and slowly said, “Don’t worry, I didn’t kill him. He’s only unconscious. It just so happens that he also needs to rest, so don’t let him work hard.”

Speaking up to this point, the vice sect leader placed his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Without the first elder, I have the final say in the Heavenly Cloud sect. I can oppose any opinion.”

The faces of the elders present were somewhat ugly. They clearly did not expect the vice sect master to be so ruthless!

“Pass down my orders. Send people to reinforce the various large cities and ask the formation master to set up a formation,”the vice sect master said coldly.

“Vice sect master, aren’t you going too far!”Someone shouted loudly.

Hearing this, the vice sect master did not say anything and raised his hand to slap the elder.

“Bang!”

The elder was immediately slapped until he vomited blood.

“Who else has an opinion?”The deputy sect master coldly swept his gaze across the crowd.

The scene instantly fell into silence. No one spoke again.

“Since no one has an opinion, just do as I say,”the deputy sect master said coldly.

After saying that, he turned around and left.

When he reached the door, the deputy sect master suddenly stopped in his tracks.

He glanced at everyone and said, “From now on, anyone who proposes to negotiate with the northern lands, or anyone who is close to the northern lands, will be killed without mercy!”

After saying that, the deputy sect master left the meeting room.

In the meeting room, everyone looked at each other, and some even had cold sweat dripping down their foreheads.

No one seemed to have expected that the deputy sect master would be so domineering.

...

Mount Hua Ning.

Zhuo Jing and the others had already rushed to Mount Hua Ning.

However, there was no one else besides them.

“Look, let me tell you. Those sect masters are all very arrogant. How could they listen to your call?”Wen Da muttered.

“That’s right, that’s right. Back then, even my grandfather couldn’t find many people,”Wen er added.

At the mention of Wen Wanyi, Zhuo Jing couldn’t help but ask in puzzlement, “Where did senior Wen Go?”

“I don’t know.”Qin Yu shook his head.

Ever since the last great war, Wen Wanyi had never appeared again. No one knew where he went.

“Brother Qin, do we have to continue waiting?”Someone asked.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “Wait one more day. If no one comes, then forget it.”

Master Wen seemed to want to say something, but in the end, he waved his hand and said, “I’d better go and drink.”

The next day.

Qin Yu stood at the mountain gate of Mount Hua Ning. He waited from morning to evening, but no one came.

“Sigh.”

Qin Yu let out a long sigh. These people were all exquisite egoists. If there were no benefits, they probably wouldn’t come.

The sky gradually darkened. Just as Qin Yu turned around and was about to go back, a figure suddenly rushed over from afar.

It was none other than Qu Zhu.

“I’m sorry. I’ve been a little tired recently and rested for a few days. I’m late,”said Qu Zhu as he stretched lazily.

Qin Yu hurriedly cupped his hands and said, “Big Brother Qu Zhu, I’m already very satisfied that you could come.”

As he spoke, more and more people arrived one after another.

In the blink of an eye, a total of eighteen people had arrived.

This made Qin Yu a little surprised. What a coincidence? Qu Zhu had just arrived, and they were also here?

In fact, these people had been hiding in the dark for many days. They wanted to observe for a while before making a decision.

If it was only Qin Yu and his group of young people, they would turn around and leave. After all, in their opinion, these people wouldn’t be able to achieve anything big.

But if there were people with three crazy and three unique abilities participating, then they would show up. Perhaps they could get some benefits.

Qin Yu quickly understood this logic. After thinking for a moment, he said, “Everyone, please rest for now. I’ll get someone to prepare the food.”

“There’s no need for that. We didn’t come all the way here just to eat,”someone said.

“That’s right. Little Friend Qin, if you have something to say, just say it.”

After seeing everyone’s comments, Qin Yu was silent for a moment before saying, “Alright, then I’ll respectfully comply. Seniors, Please!”

After welcoming everyone into Mount Hua Ning, everyone gathered together.

Regardless of whether it was the sect leader of the sect or the outstanding figures of the younger generation, they were all seated below at this moment, waiting for Qin Yu to speak.

Qin Yu swept his gaze across everyone and said in a deep voice, “Thank you all for coming. I’ve called everyone here this time because of the matters of the northern lands.”

“The northern lands have been committing countless murders recently, killing countless people. Many people in the southern region have already been affected. I don’t know what opinions you all have on this.”

“What can we think of? We could have negotiated and gotten a copy of the Sacred Heart technique, but unfortunately, some people don’t agree,”someone below mocked.

“That’s right. Where does the sense of justice come from? Who would think of that?”

“Don’t tell me you want us to protect those useless people? What’s the use of keeping them here?”

Qin Yu had long expected such a reaction. As expected, it was too unlikely for them to resist the northern lands unless their vested interests were damaged.

However, once the northern lands fully entered the southern prefecture, would there really be anyone who could remain unscathed?

“Little Friend Qin, if you really want to resist the northern lands, you might as well head to the northern borders. Why Waste Your Breath Here?”Someone said with a strange tone.

Qin Yu swept his gaze across everyone before saying, “After I step into the mighty realm, I will naturally head to the northern lands. However... Before that, I’m afraid that all of you will suffer certain injuries.”
