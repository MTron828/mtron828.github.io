The Northern Land Lord looked at the godly monarch with some surprise and said, “Who is the one who issued the challenge?”

“In reply, it is Qin Yu,”the godly monarch repeated.

The Northern Land Lord was stunned for a moment before he laughed out loud, “The one who issued the challenge to me is not him, Saint Xiao. It is actually that Qin Yu? hahahahahaha! This is really a great joke!”

“A junior who has just started out dares to issue a challenge to me?”

The godly monarch beside him quickly said, “Lord, this Qin Yu’s strength is not worth mentioning. There is no need for you to make a move. I can do it on behalf of him and bring his corpse back.”

The elementalist glanced at the godly monarch and sneered, “Indeed. If a mere qin Yu wants me to make a move, then where can I hide my face in the northern lands!”

Hence, he ordered coldly, “Do it beautifully. I want to see that Qin Yu’s corpse as soon as possible.”

After receiving the order, the godly king immediately cupped his hands and said, “Yes!”

Just as he was about to turn around and leave, he seemed to have thought of something.

“Master, there’s another matter to report.”The godly king cupped his hands and said.

The elementalist glanced at him and said coldly, “What is it?”

“One of our paintings has been lost,”the Divine King said in a deep voice.

As soon as he said this, the Elementalist’s body immediately emitted a cold aura. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He narrowed his eyes and said, “The painting has been lost? Who lost it?”

The Divine King pointed to the door and said, “It’s outside.”

At this point, he changed the topic and said, “However, the painting is most likely in Qin Yu’s hands.”

The elementalist took a deep breath. He looked up at the sky and said slowly, “Bring the painting back with you. Also, if you lose the painting, you must die.”

“Yes, Master.”

The Divine King bowed slightly, turned around and walked out.

The small leader outside the door opened his mouth and was about to speak when he saw the divine king walk out.

However, before he could speak, the divine king smashed his head with a palm.

...

Weapon Refining City.

He Teng and Yong Ji had already rushed to this place.

The famous Yong Ji was quickly recognized by people. Someone walked forward to greet him, “Mr. Yong Ji, how do you have time to come to weapon refining city?”

Yong Ji glanced at him and then subconsciously glanced at he teng as if he was showing off. Unfortunately, he teng did not represent him.

Therefore, Yong Ji asked in a deep voice, “Has Qin Yu been here before?”

That person was stunned, then nodded and said, “How do you know? He has indeed been here. He just left a few days ago.”

“Left?”Yong Ji’s expression changed.

“Yes, he looks very anxious,”that person continued to answer.

Yong Ji frowned slightly and whispered, “Could it be that he has already received the news, so he left early?”

“What did Qin Yu do in the Artifact Refining City?”He Teng suddenly asked.

That person quickly said, “He has been staying at Master Zhengyang’s house. Rumor has it that he used the purple-red heaven flame to temper his body.”

“What? He used the purple-red heaven flame to temper his body? !”Yong Ji was instantly stunned!

Of course, he knew what the purple-red heaven flame meant! Not to mention using it to temper his body, even if he got close to it, he would be burned to ashes!

“How is this possible...”Yong Ji’s face was full of shock as he muttered in a low voice.

“Let’s go to that so-called Zhengyang Master’s house,”he teng said coldly from the side.

Yong Ji did not say anything else as the two of them immediately walked towards Zhengyang Master’s house.

The moment they stepped through the door, he teng directly raised his palm. A powerful suction force forcefully pulled Zhengyang master who was sitting in the room into his hand!

He grabbed master Zhengyang’s neck with one hand and asked coldly, “Where’s Qin Yu?”

Master Zhengyang said with some fear, “He... he has already left. You... Let Go of Me First.”

He Teng saw that this master Zhengyang didn’t seem like a top-notch martial artist, so he threw him to the side.

“What did Qin Yu Do to you? Tell me honestly, or I’ll kill you immediately,”He Teng said darkly.

Master Zhengyang didn’t dare to say anything more. He immediately told he teng what had happened.

After listening to his words, Yongji was even more shocked.

“This bastard... actually used the purple-red heaven flame to temper his body! and he even reached the reversion void stage!”Yongji’s eyes were scarlet. It was unknown whether it was because of jealousy or anger.

Beside him, he teng had a face full of greed!

Using the purple-red heaven flame to temper his body, and his physical body stepping into the reversion void stage! This was enough to show how valuable Qin Yu’s physical body was!

“I’m really getting more and more interested in your physical body...”he teng grinned, revealing a sinister smile.

Then, he raised his hand and intended to kill this master Zheng Yang.

Fortunately, Yong Ji stopped him in time and said in a deep voice, “Although this person’s strength is not good, he is a talent. His refining techniques are unmatched in the entire South Province, and will be useful in the future.”

He Teng glanced at Yong Ji and then looked at master Zheng Yang.

“Master craftsman... I think you must have some divine weapons here... hand them over, and I will spare your life...”He Teng said darkly.

Master Zheng Yang said with a bitter smile, “You are too late. All my things have been robbed by Qin Yu.”

He Teng frowned slightly. He immediately searched the entire palace.

As expected, there was nothing.

“HMPH.”He Teng snorted. He waved his long robe and said coldly, “Let’s go back.”

After the two of them left, master Zhengyang could not help but curse behind them, “F * ck you. Each of them is worse than the other! A bunch of little bastards!”

...

At this moment, Qin Yu was deep in the ancient well, looking for the painting scroll.

The painting scroll was silent at the bottom of the ancient well, so it was not difficult to find.

After obtaining the painting scroll, Qin Yu was not in a hurry to leave the ancient well. Instead, he used the desolate God’s eye to look around.

Unfortunately, after searching for a while, Qin Yu did not find anything.

“Sigh, it looks like this is just an ordinary ancient well...”Qin Yu muttered softly.

Ever since he set foot on the path of cultivation, Qin Yu was unwilling to let go of any place. If there were any natural treasures, it would be a huge profit.

After Qin Yu put away the painting scroll, his body shook and he left the ancient well.

“How is it? How is it? Have you found it?”Ding Yi said excitedly.

Qin Yu took out the painting scroll and said in a deep voice, “Ding Yi, can you lend me this painting scroll for the time being? I...”

“You can take it!”Ding Yi interrupted Qin Yu.

“This thing is useless in my hands anyway. Just take it away.”

Seeing that Ding Yi didn’t know the use of this scroll, Qin Yu didn’t know what to do for a moment.

After thinking about it, Qin Yu finally decided to tell Ding Yi.

“This scroll is also useful to you. It can improve your cultivation, and it’s not just a little bit. Are you sure you want to give it to me?”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Ding Yi smiled and said, “Of course I know. However, this kind of thing is a waste in my hands. Even if I absorb it, what can I do? “Even if I absorb ten paintings, I can’t do anything for the South Province.”
