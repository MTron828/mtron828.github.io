1996 Jue Wu versus the Third Princess

No one knew how many people this meeting had attracted.

Overall many internal qis collided in the air, and the atmosphere was somewhat tense.

If it weren’t for the fact that the rules of the Sky City were still in place, a great battle would have erupted.

Qin Yu didn’t utter a sound and walked on the street with Jue Wu.

These few days, Jue Wu had become unusually quiet. She didn’t say anything as if she was thinking about something. Even the usual feasting had become scarce.

“What happened to you?” Qin Yu asked with some concern.

“Nothing. I’m just thinking about something,” Jue Wu shook her head and said.

“Thinking about something? Is it about Wen Er?” Qin Yu looked somewhat worried.

Although Jue Wu usually looked wacky, she was indeed tremendously sentimental.

It wasn’t exaggerating to say that in Jue Wu’s eyes, her friend’s matter was even more important than her own matter.

Seeing Jue Wu not speaking, Qin Yu bent down and squatted opposite her.

“Jue Wu, listen carefully. I understand your feelings, but what I have to do now is to endure. I can’t force myself into a dead end,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Jue Wu’s big eyes stared at Qin Yu. After a while, she nodded and said, “Alright, I know. I’m not a small kid.”

Seeing Jue Wu agree, Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief.

At this moment, an enormous carriage suddenly streaked across the sky.

This carriage was tremendously domineering. It had an enormous dragon head in front of it, and the dragon head was lifelike as if it was real.

The appearance of the carriage immediately attracted the attention of numerous people. They stared at the enormous carriage in the sky with envy and yet fear in their eyes.

“It’s the Si family’s carriage.”

“As expected of the Si family. The carriage is so magnificent. ”

“The carriage seems to carry people from the Yan family as well.”

Qin Yu also raised his head to look at the carriage, but his expression was somewhat not good.

There was no other reason than the person sent by the Yan family was actually the third princess!

“How could it be her…” Qin Yu frowned.

The third princess was a lunatic and a pervert.

Why did they send the third princess for such a big matter?

“Could it be the Yan family doesn’t want to be involved in this matter at all? Is that why they have deliberately sent the third princess?” Qin Yu thought to himself.

It was very likely!

After all, there were only eight aristocratic families in ancient times. The Yan family was an aristocratic family that rose abruptly. The appearance of Yan Tianming had once suppressed the other aristocratic families to the point they could hardly survive.

Therefore, the Yan family should not be very close to the other aristocratic families.

“The Si family and the Yan family came together. Are they announcing something to the outside world?” someone guessed.

At this moment, someone in the crowd noticed Qin Yu.

Their gazes swiftly gathered on Qin Yu.

“Mr. Qin, the Yan family seems to be expressing their stance to the outside world,” someone reminded out of goodwill.

Qin Yu bowed slightly, smiled, and said, “I’m by myself. How can I fight against the Si family?”

“Mr.Qin, you can’t say that. Your talent is enough to make the nine great aristocratic families look up to you,” a cultivator in the surroundings said.

“That’s right. The nine great aristocratic families might not care if it was just a chaotic body. However, you defeated the Semi-Saint as a Reversion Void Stage cultivator. That’s the potential of an Immortal Emperor.”

“Mr. Qin, don’t belittle yourself.”

Qin Yu looked at the crowd in surprise. He had never expected to have so many people supporting him.

It was probably because they had long been dissatisfied with the nine great aristocratic families, or Qin Yu’s spirit had infected them. In short, these people all had great hope for Qin Yu.

This stunned Qin Yu. He bowed and said, “Thank you very much, everyone. I will never give up.”

As he spoke, the carriage above seemed to have noticed Qin Yu.

An elder-like elderly man turned to look at Qin Yu.

“Is he Qin Yu?” The elder said coldly.

“That’s right,” the person beside him responded.

At this moment, the third princess widened her eyes and said, “It’s him! This b*stard, I actually met him here!”

With that, the third princess jumped down from the carriage and landed in front of Qin Yu.

“Third Princess!”

The people of the Yan family in the carriage also hurriedly followed. As for the elder, he seemed to have wanted to see Qin Yu for himself, so he also followed.

In an instant, several people surrounded Qin Yu. The third princess walked in front and glared at Qin Yu. She said with a vague smile, “Yo, isn’t this my little slave? You were lucky to escape last time. I didn’t expect to meet you here.”

Qin Yu looked at the third princess coldly and said, “Third Princess, let me give you some advice. It’s not the Yan family here”

“So what if it’s the Yan family or not? Could it be you dare to attack the third princess of the Yan family in Sky City?” At this moment, a Yan family’s cultivator said coldly.

Qin Yu didn’t want to argue with the third princess and planned to leave with Jue Wu. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

However, the third princess was unwilling to let the matter rest. She blocked Qin Yu’s way and said with her hands on her waist, “What do you plan to deal with the matter of you lying to me last time?”

“I’ll deal with my a*s! Get lost!” Qin Yu said impatiently.

...

“If not for Ruoxue, do you think I would care about your princess status?”

“How dare you! How dare you speak to our third princess like this!” The Yan family’s cultivator shouted.

At this moment, Jue Wu looked at the cultivator coldly and said, “Are you deaf? Didn’t you hear that this little slut was the one who started it?”

“Who did you call little slut?” The third princess was so angry that her face turned red.

“I called you. Why? Little slut, if not for the prince’s sake, I would have slapped you right now!” Jue Wu said coldly.

The third princess was furious. She was about to attack without saying anything.

Fortunately, the people of the Yan family intervened in time and stopped the third princess, and avoided the fight.

“Just you wait! You can’t be arrogant for long. I’ll let you know that the Yan family is not to be trifled with!” The third princess was pulled away by someone, but her mouth was still cursing non-stop.

This time, Jue Wu behaved very maturely. It was rare for her not to make a scene. Instead, she was incredibly calm.

The more Jue Wu behaved like this, the more uneasy Qin Yu felt.

Back in Nanzhou, Jue Wu was an existence that made people tremble in fear. In terms of ferocity, even the third princess could not compare with her!

...

“Jue Wu, you…” Qin Yu wanted to ask her questions, but at this moment, the elder of the Si family looked at Qin Yu.

“You are Qin Yu?” The elder said coldly.

Qin Yu knew there was no chance of reconciliation with the Si family, so he said coldly, “Yes, I am. Why?”

“You’re quite bold,” the elder said coldly.
