“The internal qi of the Path of Heaven has already begun to change, and once the Golden Great Dao descends, we no longer need to suppress our strength.”

A voice came from the void, making Xing Xiu’s expression even more contorted.

“It’s none of your business! I heard the ghost race and the monster race have an extraordinary means that can repair damaged souls. I’ll visit the ghost race when I’m done with my personal matters.”

When they reached the Tribulation Transcending Stage, space could no longer confine them as long as the Path of Heaven did not suppress their strength.

With a divine thought, he could pass through the void if he wanted to.

At this moment, Qin Yu had already returned to the peak of the eighth level.

He wanted to see if he could break through to the fifth grade at the place closest to the Path of Heaven.

Only when the Golden Great Dao descended would he have little more power to protect himself.

“Right now, many Holy Sons in the Holy Region should have already broken through to the fifth grade. With various resources and methods, it’s very likely some of them have already reached the peak of the True Saint Realm. They’re just waiting for the Great Dao to descend and are ready to break through to the Tribulation Transcending Stage.”

Qin Yu looked solemn. He was stuck in fourth grade now, and the gap would only grow bigger.

He sat cross-legged on the ground and released his divine sense only after his mind completely calmed down.

He let his divine sense wander freely in the air and comprehend the internal qi in the void.

On the mountain peak closest to the Path of Heaven in purgatory, Qin could not sense the complete way.

However, after his mind completely calmed down, he could sense the numerous subtle ways of the Path of Heaven.

In the air, Qin Yu could sense countless tiny snake-like rules of the Path of Heaven flashing past.

Each tiny snake represented a dao technique.

Although extremely tiny, they could shake the world and reverse the universe after achieving Great Success.

At True Saint Realm, it was implanting a seed.

In the Tribulation Transcending Stage, it sprouted and grew.

How did the Immortal Emperor and the Demon Emperor who jumped out of the Path of Heaven make it?

And if the dao technique was invincible, how did Wu Ji break through to the fifth-grade True Saint and reach the Tribulation Transcending Stage at the end of the road of the dao technique? He even used his Tribulation Transcending body to fight against an Imperial Immortal.

At this moment, Qin Yu had completely set aside the thought of comprehending the dao technique.

After he completely immersed his mind in contemplation, he seemed to have comprehended something, faintly grasping onto something.

And the spiritual bead in the center of his divine sense seemed to have become brighter as he comprehended.

After condensing this spirit bead, Qin Yu felt his comprehension of cultivation had deepened significantly, and he no longer had the impatience he previously had.

When Qin Yu stopped cultivating, he realized he suddenly had a sense of hunger.

The power of the soul in his sea of consciousness had decreased significantly. The spirit bead was self-running, absorbing a massive amount of soul power.

“If that’s the case, wouldn’t my soul power become stronger from time to time?”

Qin Yu was overjoyed. He did not know the divine sense spirit bead had such an effect.

It was time to go back to purgatory and look for Nightmare.

As long as he had the Soul Torment Mind Technique, Nightmare, which used dreams as a means of attack, could not pose a threat to him at all.

Instead, it could become a supplement for his soul.

“Qin Yu, why do I feel your soul seems to have transformed after your cultivation for a short half a day? Your temperament seems to have faintly changed. Could it be that you’ve broken through? But your internal qi doesn’t seem like it.”

Mei Li asked curiously.

“I didn’t break through. The tide of the Path of Heaven hasn’t returned to this galaxy yet, but I did have some comprehension just now.”

Suddenly, a jade talisman in the Sumeru ring exploded.

Qin Yu’s expression changed, and he suddenly stood up.

“What’s the matter, Qin Yu?”

Jue Wu had just gotten up from the Sumeru ring and asked with sleepy eyes.

“Wang Feng has just used the jade talisman I gave him. Something must have happened. I can also sense some ghostly qi fluctuations in the fifth level of purgatory, but I don’t know if they’re related.”

“Let me go there. I haven’t eaten the flesh of the ghost race yet. I want to try it!”

Jue Wu’s stomach growled, and she left without waiting for Qin Yu’s reply.

Qin Yu shook his head with a bitter smile but was not worried.

“Hmm?”

Qin Yu suddenly sensed something and turned to the ninth level.

Xi Menn’s figure appeared. He had a massive wound on his body.

His clothes were also tremendously tattered. At this moment, he looked like a beggar.

However, Qin Yu felt a suffocating sword intent from within his body. That sword intent was like a dragon that was breathing.

Xi Menn seemed to have gained some comprehension on the ninth level.

He appeared in tattered clothes and looked disheveled, but he was actually harboring sharpness within his body and in peak condition. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

However, when he opened his eyes, it was a shocking attack.

He silently returned to the mountain peak and nodded slightly upon seeing Qin Yu.

“It’s so strange. This guy is in fourth grade, but it gives me a feeling that he’s even scarier than you. I feel like I’ll be killed by him directly. Even the strongest blood river can’t stop his sword.”

Mei Li seemed to have sensed Xi Menn’s arrival. She opened her eyes and stared at Xi Menn.

“What you’re feeling is right. He can indeed kill you with one slash.”

“Xi Menn, come at me with all your might!”

To verify what he had just comprehended, the divine sense on Qin Yu’s back transformed into two black wings.

He leaped ten thousand meters into the sky with a flap of the wings.

Xi Menn’s sword intent was too lethal. He held no grudge against the surrounding cultivators, so it was best to stay high up in the sky.

Xi Menn held the iron sword in his hand, but no one saw him make any move.

However, he had already stepped on a wisp of sword energy and arrived a thousand meters away from Qin Yu’s position.

“What a terrifying speed! Even though I’ve recently comprehended the way of the line word formula and have the Gale Resistance Boot and the cultivation method, I’m only slightly faster than him. The sword is indeed the fastest weapon in the world.”

In an instant, Qin Yu felt his body sinking. A vast sword intent had already locked onto him.

The golden light flickered on Qin Yu’s body, and he unleashed the Saintly Body Technique.

His chaotic qi surged into all his muscles, causing them to wriggle like snakes.

At this moment, his physical body was comparable to the hardest defensive equipment. He had to be fully prepared to face Xi Menn.

Xi Menn closed his eyes. The sword intent on his ordinary iron sword suddenly surged like the sea.

In just a moment, the sword energy had already reached its peak.

At this moment, the iron sword seemed to be the master of heaven and earth, evolving into a world of swords.

The sword energy resonated in the eighth level of purgatory.

For the cultivator who used the sword, at this moment, the sword was completely beyond his control.

Those who could come to the eighth level were all top-notch cultivators. Their swords had been refined with their spiritual consciousness and blood essence for countless years, so they could be said to be a part of their bodies. However, at this moment, their limbs were about to leave them and become a part of Xi Menn.

Even the swords in the alternate dimension started to thrash around as if wanting to break free and arrive by Xi Menn’s side.
