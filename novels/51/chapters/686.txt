Chapter 687: The Power of the Two Male Corpses Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Two resplendent rays of light shot into the sky! The entire formation stage was buzzing, as if it was brewing some powerful force!

This commotion naturally attracted the attention of the man and woman.

The two of them couldn’t help but look at the formation platform, their brows furrowed.

“What’s going on?” The woman asked in surprise.

The man didn’t say anything, but his eyes swept over the formation platform.

The mustache man realized what was happening in front of him. He glanced at the two corpses on the formation platform and quickly retreated to the side.

The two corpses were shining on the formation platform, and rumbling sounds could be heard continuously.

Crack.

Finally, the formation platform couldn’t take it anymore and started to collapse.

An extremely powerful force fell into the two corpses.

“Swoosh!”

The male corpses’ eyes suddenly opened!

They slowly stood up from the ruins. An extremely ancient internal Qi lingered around the two male corpses’ body.

At this moment, Qin Yu couldn’t take it anymore. He gritted his teeth and shouted with all his might, “Quickly... save me!”

After an angry roar, the two corpses slowly turned around and looked in Qin Yu’s direction.

Qin Yu anxiously looked at the mustache man and used his eyes to ask how to control the two male corpses.

The mustache man seemed to have seen through Qin Yu’s intentions and hurriedly said, “Qin Yu, these two corpses borrowed your blood essence to temporarily resurrect. You have to use your divine sense to control them!”

Currently, Qin Yu’s divine sense was almost crushed by this spell. It was as difficult as ascending to the heavens to separate his divine sense.

“Damn it...” Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse in his heart. He endured the pain and closed his eyes slightly, forcefully separating a strand of his divine sense.

At the center of his brows, a bean-sized golden light burst out and then fell directly into the center of the brows of a male corpse.

The eyes of this male corpse immediately burst out with a glimmer of light.

Qin Yu did not dare to delay any longer. He immediately used his divine sense to urge this male corpse to walk toward him.

“What exactly is this thing?” Not far away, the eyes of the man and woman from the Han Palace were filled with doubt.

“Who cares what it is. No one can break my spell unless they are a Martial Saint.” The man sneered.

At that moment, the male corpse had already walked up to Qin Yu.

He slowly raised both of his hands and grabbed at the icy blue light. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Humph, using your body to touch my spell is simply courting death!” The man from Han Palace could not help but sneer.

However, in the next second, his expression froze.

The male corpse grabbed the icy blue light and lightly pulled with his palm. The icy blue light that could cover the sky and earth was torn apart like paper.

“How is this possible?!” The expression of the two people from Han Palace changed drastically.

Qin Yu was finally able to catch his breath. He got up from the ground and the cosmic form on his body slowly disappeared.

“Damn it, I almost died.” Qin Yu inevitably felt a lingering fear.

The man with the mustache ran in front of Qin Yu and said with a smile, “Let’s leave the rest to these two male corpses.”

Qin Yu also nodded and said with a hint of anticipation, “I also want to see... What kind of strength do these two male corpses have.”

Under Qin Yu’s control, the two male corpses turned around and walked toward the two people from Han Palace.

The man immediately shook his palm, and his gloves flickered with rays of light.

However, the woman’s beautiful face had a hint of solemnity.

She whispered, “Mr. Duan, I have a bad feeling. Let’s quickly retreat.”

The man who was called Mr. Duan snorted coldly, “I am at the peak of the Martial Marquis realm, and can be said to be invincible in this world! What demons and ghosts? They are just playing tricks!”

Before he finished his words, Mr. Duan’s gloves began to shine, and then he strode toward the male corpses.

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer in his heart.

Qin Yu had personally witnessed the toughness of these two male corpses.

Even the bronze sword couldn’t hurt them in the slightest, yet this Mr. Duan still dared to take the initiative to attack? He was simply seeking death!

“Go to hell!” Mr. Duan roared angrily, and his fist fiercely smashed toward the male corpse’s vital point.

“Clang!”

A loud sound instantly exploded.

This unparalleled fist smashed firmly onto the male corpse’s face.

But what was frightening was that this fist actually didn’t injure the male corpse in the slightest. It didn’t even leave a trace.

“How... how is this possible!” Mr. Duan’s expression instantly changed drastically.

This fist contained almost all of his inner strength. No one in the world should be able to defend against it.

But this strange corpse in front of him... Was not affected at all. This was simply illogical!

“This can’t be real, this can’t be real!” Mr. Duan was not reconciled. He roared and threw another punch.

“Crack!”

The male corpse finally made his move. He raised his hand and grabbed Mr. Duan’s fist.

Mr. Duan’s face suddenly changed. He tried his best to struggle, but he found that he could not break free at all.

Then, the male corpse pressed his palm lightly. Mr. Duan’s glove and fist were both crushed into pieces.

“Ah!!!”

The anguished wail spread throughout the entire wilderness.

For a moment, everyone couldn’t help but gasp!

The male corpse didn’t stop there. He raised his pale palm and gently smacked Mr. Duan’s head.

“Smack!”

That seemingly weak palm contained a thousand-ton force.

At the moment of contact, Mr. Duan’s head exploded like a watermelon.

“A peak-stage Martial Marquis is actually so weak!” Qin Yu was overjoyed when he saw this.

The strength of these two male corpses was indeed beyond imagination.

Not far away, the woman from the Han Palace had a pale face. When she witnessed Mr. Duan’s head being smashed by a single smack, she already had the intention to retreat.

“You have already killed three members of our Han Palace. We will definitely remember this grudge,” The woman said coldly.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “If you don’t leave now, the next one to die will be you!”

As he spoke, the male corpse had already strode towards the woman.

The woman secretly gritted her teeth. She fiercely glared at Qin Yu, then turned around and left.

In the blink of an eye, she disappeared from everyone’s sight.

After she left, Qin Yu hurriedly bent down and took out Mr. Duan’s golden core.

“A golden core at the peak of the Martial Marquis realm... what an unexpected harvest.” Qin Yu licked his lips and then stuffed the golden core into his mouth.

Pure spiritual energy exploded in Qin Yu’s body.

He immediately circulated his Mental Circulation Technique and slowly absorbed this golden core.

At this moment, Qin Yu was already enough to step into the middle stage of the Martial Marquis Realm.

However, after thinking about it, Qin Yu decided to temporarily suppress his cultivation. He was planning to go to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association to save people first!
