It had to be said that what Xiao Yu said made some sense.

The birth of the medicine king previously could be said to be earth-shattering, let alone a ten-thousand-year-old herb.

After thinking for a long time, Qin Yu decided to tell Tang Mo the next day.

Even if he couldn’t get this ten-thousand-year-old herb, the Tang Clan would at least give him some compensation.

The next day.

Before Qin Yu woke up, there was a knock on the door.

He opened the door and saw two people standing at the door.

One of them was Song Shan and Ancestor Guan, whom he had met in Qing City.

Beside them was a Martial Marquis.

“Why are you here?” Qin Yu frowned.

Song Shan said with a nonchalant smile, “Of course I’m here to help you. Since our Hong Yi Sect has reached a partnership with you, we will naturally help you.”

“Help me?” Qin Yu recalled what Su Qian had said before.

The Hong Yi Sect had indeed sent people to help him seize the ten-thousand-year-old herbs, but Song Shan and Ancestor Guan alone were probably useless.

“From now on, you will listen to my orders,” Song Shan said indifferently.

He swaggered into the villa and glanced around. Then, he said with a sarcastic tone, “You sure know how to enjoy yourself.”

Song Shan and Ancestor Guan had been hostile to Qin Yu before. Now, their attitudes were even more unpredictable.

Qin Yu ignored Song Shan’s words and asked, “How do you plan to help me?”

Song Shan smiled nonchalantly and said, “You don’t have to care about that. In short, you just have to listen to me.”

Qin Yu snorted and said, “I don’t think there’s a need for that.”

Hearing this, Song Shan raised his eyebrows. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

He slowly stood up and looked at Qin Yu coldly.

“Qin Yu, you’d better not be too arrogant. There’s no Ning Kun here to help you,” Song Shan said coldly.

Ancestor Guan also took a step forward and sneered. “You killed so many of us. Ning Kun doesn’t care, but it doesn’t mean that we don’t care!”

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed slightly.

These two people really didn’t have good intentions.

“Get out of here right now.” Qin Yu looked at the two of them coldly and said word by word.

Hearing this, Ancestor Guan immediately took a step forward and shouted, “I’m telling you, you’d better watch your words. Otherwise, don’t blame us for being impolite!”

Song Shan also said with a nonchalant smile, “It’s true that we don’t dare to kill you, but it’s not a problem for us to make you suffer.”

“Is that so? Then you guys can go ahead and try!” Qin Yu shouted, and the internal qi on his body immediately exploded!

Song Shan snorted and said, “The outside world is boasting that you are a rare genius, but I, Song Shan, think that you are just so-so!”

“Let me teach this junior who doesn’t know his place a lesson!” Ancestor Guan shouted loudly, and his fist burst out with waves of bright light!

His incomparably fierce fist immediately stirred up gusts of wind, and that violent inner strength poured out!

Qin Yu naturally wouldn’t back down. He clenched his fist and raised his hand to unleash the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist!

The golden light shook the surroundings, and both fists collided in an instant.

“Boom!”

A terrifying power swept out in all directions with the two of them as the center!

The ground instantly caved in, and the villa suffered an even greater impact, with cracks appearing one after another!

“Whoosh!”

In the next second, Ancestor Guan was sent flying, and his fist was even beaten until it was dripping with blood!

Ancestor Guan had relied on his swordsmanship to begin with, and just by relying on his physical body, he wasn’t a match for him.

Song Shan’s brows furrowed slightly.

“Is that all you’ve got?” Qin Yu sneered.

Ancestor Guan jumped up from the ground. Then, with a shake of his palm, a scarlet long sword fell into his palm!

“What’s going on? I can’t even go to the bathroom in peace!”

At this moment, the man with the mustache grumbled as he walked out.

Seeing the man with the mustache, Song Shan frowned slightly.

“Qin Yu, what happened?” Xiao Yu also walked out.

“Three Martial Marquises?” Song Shan frowned even more.

Just Qin Yu alone was enough to give them a headache.

With the addition of the two Martial Marquises, the man with the mustache and Xiao Yu, Song Shan and the others had no chance of winning.

Therefore, Song Shan withdrew his internal qi.

He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Qin Yu, you do have some ability, but with just the few of you, you want to obtain ten-thousand-year-old herbs? You’re dreaming!”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Don’t tell me that the two of you trash can get the herbs.”

Song Shan said with a nonchalant smile, “The Hong Yi Sect has been in existence for so many years, so we naturally have some connections.”

“Qin Yu, don’t you understand that you have to rely on your friends when you go out?”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said, “Oh yeah? So you have helpers in Tang City?”

Song Shan snorted coldly and didn’t answer.

He pulled Ancestor Guan and turned around to leave.

When they reached the door, Song Shan shouted, “Qin Yu refused to accept our help and even injured us. We can only leave.”

Seeing Song Yu’s behavior, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel like laughing.

“What are you shouting for? Don’t worry, I won’t tell Ning Kun,” Qin Yu sneered.

Song Shan didn’t say anything more and turned around to leave the villa.

“Such a good house is broken,” the man with the mustache muttered.

Qin Yu also frowned.

After all, this house didn’t belong to him. It was indeed a bit outrageous to break it.

Qin Yu took out a bank card from his pocket and said in a low voice, “I’ll go and withdraw some money later to compensate Tang Mo.”

After Song Shan and Ancestor Guan left, their expressions turned cold.

“Ancestor Guan, is your hand okay?” Song Shan asked.

Ancestor Guan gritted his teeth and said, “It’s fine, but I can’t take this!”

“Back when I was famous, he, Qin Yu, probably wasn’t born yet! Now, a junior is bullying me. How can I bear it?”

Song Shan also said coldly, “My friend died at the hands of Qin Yu, so I want to kill him more than you do!”

Ancestor Guan looked at Song Shan and said with a frown, “But Ning Kun said that we aren’t allowed to have any conflict with Qin Yu, and Qin Yu seems to be of use to the organization.”

Song Shan’s eyes narrowed and he said with a sneer, “This is the Tang City! The border of Pyro! Once the ten thousand year old herbs are born, there will definitely be a big fight!”

“When that time comes, who will know who killed Qin Yu?”

Ancestor Guan suddenly came to a realization.

He looked at Song Shan and said, “We can’t do this ourselves.”

“Don’t worry.” Song Shan said with a nonchalant smile.

“I have a lot of connections in the Tang City. The few foreign powers in the vicinity also have quite a good relationship with Hong Yi Sect.”

Ancestor Guan narrowed his eyes and said, “Alright, then we will rely on you.”

..

In the villa, Qin Yu frowned slightly.

He was a little suspicious of Ning Kun’s intentions.

He knew that Song Shan and Ancestor Guan didn’t like him, but he sent them here. What was his intention?

Just as Qin Yu was thinking, the door was opened.

Then, he saw Tang Mo walking in with his men.

“Damn it, who did this to my villa?” Tang Mo looked at the broken walls in the room and couldn’t help but be furious.
