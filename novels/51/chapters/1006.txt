Chapter 1007: Chapter 1,007, refining the recovery spirit pill

“What technique is this?”

Seeing this scene, not only Xiang Danqing, but also the pavilion master was extremely shocked.

Xiang Danqing narrowed his eyes and said, “This child’s divine sense is extremely powerful.”

“Refining pills and divine sense are inseparable. His technique is inferior to yours, but his divine sense is more acute,”said the pavilion master in a deep voice.

At this moment, pavilion master suddenly guessed something!

“He gathered all his divine sense on his right hand to control the spiritual fire and refine the pill!”Pavilion master exclaimed.

Xiang Danqing’s expression also changed slightly.

“I seem to have heard of this technique. It is called the divine right hand, but it is said that this technique can cause damage to the divine sense,”Xiang Danqing said in a deep voice. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Pavilion master frowned slightly, and her beautiful eyes stared intently at Qin Yu.

Under the burning of the spiritual fire, Qin Yu’s divine sense also felt a trace of damage.

However, compared to the heavenly tribulation not long ago, this damage was not worth mentioning at all. It was almost negligible.

At this moment, the spiritual fire in Qin Yu’s hand once again entered the medicinal cauldron.

The medicinal residue actually began to ooze out medicinal juice!

“Hahaha!”Xiang Danqing couldn’t help but burst into laughter when he saw this.

“Could it be that this kid wants to use the medicinal residue to refine the heart cleansing pill?”

“He only refined nine pills out of the medicinal herbs. How many pills can he refine out of the medicinal residue?”

“Ji Yuhong, you’re going to lose for sure!”

Pavilion master didn’t say anything, but Xiang Danqing was right.

Could it be that Qin Yu could refine more than nine pills out of the medicinal residue?

Qin Yu poured all his divine sense into his right hand and slowly refined the residue.

The medicinal juice that burst out from the residue quickly began to shrink.

At this moment, the clear heart pill actually began to flow out the medicinal juice!

“HM?”Seeing this scene, Xiang Danqing’s expression changed slightly!

The so-called number of pills formed was the proportion of the medicinal efficacy used.

The reason why Qin Yu only refined nine clear heart pills was because the proportion of the medicinal juice used was too low!

Now, these wasted medicinal juice flowed out from the clear heart pills!

“There’s still a chance!”

Seeing this scene, pavilion master was instantly overjoyed!

“Withdraw!”

At this moment, Qin Yu shouted loudly!

The cauldron immediately emitted crackling sounds!

One clear heart pill after another took shape within the cauldron!

Qin Yu put away the spiritual fire, and his divine sense quickly returned to his body.

Following that, Qin Yu walked to the front of the medicinal cauldron. He stretched out his hand and took out the medicinal pills within the cauldron one by one.

One Pill, two pills, three pills.

Everyone stared at the medicinal cauldron.

“Sixteen pills, seventeen pills, eighteen pills, nineteen pills, twenty pills.”

There were twenty pure heart pills in Qin Yu’s hands!

“How is this possible!”Xiang Danqing’s expression changed drastically!

There were twenty pure heart pills, two more than him!

Seeing this, the pavilion master couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“Xiang Danqing, you lost,”the pavilion master said indifferently.

Xiang Danqing stared at Qin Yu with a gloomy expression.

“Kid, you have some ability.”After a long time, Xiang Danqing took a deep breath.

Qin Yu bowed and said, “Senior used a stone cauldron, and I used a medicinal cauldron. I only took advantage of the medicinal cauldron, and my technique is far inferior to Senior’s.”

Xiang Danqing was stunned, and then he laughed loudly and said, “Good, good! Kid, you are much more pleasing to the eye than Ji Yuhong!”

Qin Yu looked at the pavilion master with slight embarrassment. The pavilion master smiled and shook his head, indicating that he didn’t care.

“Tell me, what do you want me to help you with?”Xiang Danqing said.

Hearing this, Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief.

He said in a deep voice, “I Need Senior’s help to refine the recovery spirit pill.”

“Recovery Spirit Pill? What’s That?”Xiang Danqing had obviously never heard of it.

Qin Yu took out the prescription and handed it to Xiang Danqing.

After Xiang Danqing finished reading it, he looked at Qin Yu in surprise.

“Your golden core was damaged?”Xiang Danqing said in surprise.

“In other words, you didn’t use your spiritual power at all just now?”

Qin Yu scratched his head and said, “Yes, it’s all my fault for being young and ignorant. I was arrogant and tried to forcefully become a martial saint, but I failed...”

“Forcefully become a martial saint?”Xiang Danqing’s eyes instantly widened.

“Not only are your alchemy skills so superb, but your strength is also so powerful?”

Xiang Danqing could hardly believe it!

“Ji Yuhong, where did you find such a disciple? Find Me One Too!”Xiang Danqing couldn’t help but say.

Pavilion master smiled and said, “Alright, Hurry up and look at the pill formula. We can’t afford to waste time.”

“Pavilion Master, you don’t seem to have looked at the pill formula either,”Qin Yu reminded him.

Pavilion master shook his head helplessly.

Thus, the two of them took this pill formula and started to read it carefully.

The stone hanging in Qin Yu’s heart finally fell to the ground.

He let out a slight sigh of relief and said in a low voice, “I can finally step into the martial saint realm.”

Qin Yu took a look at the surrounding environment.

This was a place with no people and an excellent environment.

Perhaps, breaking through to the martial saint realm here was the wisest choice.

About two hours later.

Xiang Danqing and the pavilion master walked out together.

“How is it?”Qin Yu asked quickly.

The pavilion master said, “Wait here. We’ll go to the mountain to get the herbs.”

“Okay!”Qin Yu nodded excitedly!

The two of them did not say anything else and immediately walked up the mountain.

About half an hour later, the two of them returned to the valley with the herbs.

The three of them walked in front of the cauldron and the pavilion master reminded them, “This spirit restoration pill has extremely strict requirements for alchemists, and the control of the spiritual fire has to be exquisite, so... we can’t fail no matter what.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “Seniors, don’t feel too pressured. I have three stalks of heavenly vanilla in my hands anyway.”

“Okay, then don’t waste time. Let’s begin,”said Xiang Danqing.
