2220 The Spirit-Gathering Pill

Dean Lei frowned and said.

“Jue Wu has a Nirvana Body, and her cultivation depends on her actions. How can she progress if she doesn’t have a clear mind?”

Flower Granny shook her head while Dean Lei was speechless for a moment.

Of course, he knew why Jue Wu wanted to go to the land of exile. However, thinking that it would be difficult to return once she went there, Dean Lei could not agree.

“We’ll talk about this later.”

Dean Lei frowned and said, still unable to make up his mind.

…

In the Solitary Cloud City, the continent of purgatory.

Qin Yu was at the central square. He frowned as he looked at the large group of people.

“We need to team up with cultivators above the Tribulation Stage to go to the sixth level of purgatory.”

“We need a strong main attacker.”

…

“F*ck! I’ve been cheated. The information and the coordinates of the ten-thousand-year-old ginseng that I bought from the Moon Listening Pavilion for three pieces of spiritual essence had long been exposed. I’ve been fooled!”

Qin Yu’s expression was a little ugly.

With so many cultivators fighting over a single ten-thousand-year-old ginseng, given his current condition, he truly had no confidence.

Moreover, after experiencing Chang Hu’s incident, he was cautious about joining other teams.

The Holy Region had issued a wanted warrant, and countless people were eyeing him covetously.

What a headache! He would probably need to spend a lot of time if he did not find a team to clean up the Demonic Beast in the periphery.

However, finding an unreliable team might get backfire.

“I heard that Edgeless Team is recruiting an additional person.”

“Really? Isn’t Edgeless Team not changed in numbers over a hundred years? Why does he suddenly recruit an additional person?”

“It seems that one of the team members died at the hands of the Demonic Beast on the eighth level of purgatory, so they need to replenish their members.”

“F*ck, the eighth level of purgatory! I heard all the Demonic Beasts there had comprehended the power of the way! They actually dared to enter.”

…

There was a burst of animated discussion.

Qin Yu turned to look at that group.

A man with a confident and impressive demeanor was lazily leaning against a stall. He held a giant silver bow in his hand, and dozens of black arrows were behind him.

“Anyone who catches my arrow can join my team and go to the sixth level of purgatory to fight together for the ginseng. The acquired possessions are to be divided equally.”

He seemed to sense Qin Yu’s gaze and grinned.

“It’s not easy to catch my arrow. You might die.”

“Xing Mou’s arrows aren’t easy to catch. I heard countless Demonic Beasts have died under his arrows.”

“Yeah, forget it. Life is more important.”

“I’ll do it!”

A burly man walked toward the starry eyes and said loudly.

“The ten-thousand-year-old ginseng has comprehended dao. Even if it’s just a petal, it’s enough for my cultivation to advance.”

A few more people directly signed up to participate. They were all cultivators with tremendous bodies.

Many old cultivators had rushed to purgatory to fight for the opportunity with the emergence of the ten-thusand-year-old ginseng emerged this time.

“Tomorrow at this time, outside Solitary Cloud City, those who catch my arrow will join the team.”

Xing Mou stood up and said.

His gaze turned to Qin Yu, and he frowned slightly.

“That’s strange. Why would the Holy Region spend so much spiritual essence to send you, a second-grade True Saint, a message?”

“What do you mean?”

Qin Yu frowned. Was this guy a lapdog of the Holy Region’s aristocratic families?

“This pair of hands is for you. They were sent over by the people from the Holy Region.”

Xing Mou tossed a ring over.

“Chang Mang!”

Qin Yu instantly recognized Chang Mang’s hands. There were patches of blue and purple on them. He wondered what tortures he had suffered to have his hands become like this.

His eyes filled with rage and almost popped out, and his fists clenched tightly.

He stared at Xing Mou with his blood-red eyes.

“Tell me. How is Chang Mang’s current condition?”

“Am I obligated to reply to you? With your cultivation of the second grade?”

Xing Mou laughed maniacally with a face full of disdain.

“If you want to revenge, you can come to Solitary Cloud City tomorrow. However, I will make an exception and spare your life. A piece of trash like you can bring us so many resources. It’s simply sending us a precious child!”

“Cherish your last night.”

Qin Yu narrowed her eyes and said.

“Haha, your cultivation is average, but your tone is quite arrogant. Feel the difference of our gap properly.”

Xing Mou pointed his finger, and an extremely sharp internal qi locked onto him.

That finger was like a massive arrow that wanted to pierce through his body.

“Brat, do you understand the difference between us now? If we weren’t in the city, you’re already dead.”

Xing Mou looked at Qin Yu and laughed mockingly.

“Xing Mou, stop playing around.”

A man with a steady internal qi and a straight face said calmly.

He walked to Qin Yu’s side and said softly, “I would be very disappointed if everyone in the Holy Region had a cultivation like yours.”

With that, the two turned around and left.

“Si family, I will remember this. When I return to the Holy Region one day, I will make you pay the price with blood.”

Qin Yu put on the bead, and the demonic qi on his body instantly overflowed. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

He returned to the Moon Listening Pavilion. This time, he concealed his internal qi. Thus even Ji Yue did not discover his identity.

After finding a place to stay, Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the ground.

A ball of purple fire suddenly appeared in his hand. He wanted to refine a Spirit-Gathering Pill first.

The other herbs would be sufficient for him to continue refining if he could obtain the ten-thousand-year-old ginseng.

With his current soul injuries, it would be very troublesome if he were to face a cultivator who had entered the fifth grade.

The two people today should be cultivators who had comprehended the power of rules.

Qin Yu took out one-third of the herbs needed for refining the Spirit-Gathering Pill and put the rest back into his spatial ring.

The purple fire suddenly ignited. Under the urging of the True Saint’s spiritual energy, the temperature of the purple fire became even higher. Qin Yu carefully felt the temperature of the spiritual fire and slowly threw in the herbs.

One after another, the herbs turned into liquid under the burning of the purple fire.

Qin Yu controlled the fire and slowly refined all the materials.

At the moment of the formation of the pill, he took out the daffodil leaf and squeezed two drops of juice into it.

The moment the daffodil juice entered the furnace, the surrounding scene changed.

He was as if stepping into another space. Daffodils floated around him, and a celestial aura lingered around. It was like a paradise on earth.

Was this the law of heaven and earth that the daffodil had comprehended after becoming a demon? A drop of juice could create such a strange phenomenon.

Qin Yu was secretly surprised.

The pill was formed. A pill full of the fragrance of daffodils was out of the furnace.

Qin Yu grabbed the pill and threw it into his mouth without hesitation.

In an instant, the pill turned into a stream of green river and flowed into his divine sense.

That horrible wound slowly healed under the washing of the green river.

An indescribable sense of joy made Qin Yu feel refreshed.

While the wound was healing, his spiritual sense was also growing at a tremendous speed.

This speed even surpassed his physical cultivation.

“The medicinal effects are so strong!”

Qin Yu was tremendously shocked. It was the power of the daffodil.

It took Qin Yu about two hours to absorb the power of the pill.

At this moment, his divine sense had already recovered by 70%.

Hmm?

However, the black portion of his divine sense figurine became even more scorching at this moment.
