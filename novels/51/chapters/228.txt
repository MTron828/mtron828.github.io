Chapter 229: Which One of Us Is Trash! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

As he looked at the intimate photo of Yan Ruoxue and Qin Yu on the wall, the young man’s whole body trembled!

“This b*stard...” the young man roared in a low voice. His eyes were bloodshot, and anger was burning in his chest!

“Young master...” the person next to him called out shakily.

The young man took a deep breath. He raised his hand and was about to erase these photos.

At this moment, the sound of an engine came from outside.

After looking sideways, he saw an Audi RS7 drive in.

The young man’s expression turned cold, and he immediately turned around to walk out.

His entourage followed closely behind.

In the courtyard, Qin Yu looked at the car with the Jingdu license plate, and his eyes couldn’t help but flash with excitement!

“Ruoxue is here?” Qin Yu whispered.

Thinking of this, he hurriedly ran into the room.

However, just as he reached the door, Qin Yu bumped into this young man.

This young man’s body was extremely hard, and it felt as if he had bumped into a wall.

Qin Yu raised his head to size up this young man, and asked with a frown, “Who are you?”

Updates by

The young man didn’t answer this question. Instead, he sneered and said, “King of Chuzhou? You’re so impressive.”

Qin Yu couldn’t figure out the identity of this young man for a moment, so he said politely, “Those are all rumors. I’m just an ordinary citizen.”

“You actually know that it is a rumor?” The young man’s expression was cold.

“You actually know that you’re just an ordinary citizen?” Then, the young man shouted loudly! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, Qin Yu’s expression gradually turned cold.

It was very obvious that this person was an enemy, not a friend.

“Who exactly are you?” Qin Yu took a step back and coldly questioned.

“This is young master Han Wei, the eldest son of the Han family of Jingdu!” The attendant beside him shouted loudly.

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

The Han family of Jingdu?

Why hadn’t he heard of them before?

“I don’t know anything about the Han family. What exactly are you doing here?” Qin Yu said with a frown.

“You don’t know about the Han family? How dare you?!” When he heard this, the attendant by the side was instantly enraged!

He was about to make a move, but was stopped by Han Wei.

“It’s normal for commoners like you not to know about the Han family,” Han Wei said indifferently.

“I only need to tell you that the Han family is on par with the Yan family. That’s enough.”

On par with the Yan family?

The Han family really had quite a powerful background!

Qin Yu frowned and said, “I don’t seem to know you.”

Han Wei narrowed his eyes and said, “But I know you! You’re just a lowly commoner from Chuzhou, yet you actually dare to covet the daughter of the Yan family. How sinful!”

When he heard this, Qin Yu completely understood.

He was most likely a love rival.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Miss Yan and I are in love with each other. What’s wrong with that?”

Han Wei sneered and said, “How can a lowly commoner like you be worthy of Yan Ruoxue?”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Sir, I’m indeed just an ordinary person, but isn’t your address a little too rude.”

“Rude?” Han Wei laughed loudly.

“What? A commoner also has dignity?” Han Wei narrowed his eyes and said.

Qin Yu’s expression gradually turned cold.

He took a deep breath and suppressed his anger as he said, “Please leave immediately. My home does not welcome you.”

“Oh really?” Han Wei raised his eyebrows.

He didn’t take Qin Yu seriously at all. Instead, he said cockily, “You’re just a commoner, yet you actually want to go from rags to riches. Do you know what it means to be evenly matched in terms of status?”

“I don’t know,” Qin Yu said with a cold expression.

“I only know that I like Yan Ruoxue, and Yan Ruoxue likes me. That’s enough.”

“As for status, I believe that one day, I will be worthy of Miss Yan.”

These few words completely infuriated Han Wei!

Waves of terrifying internal qi burst out from his body!

A sense of oppression was emitted!

Qin Yu’s expression changed!

Han Wei’s strength was beyond imagination. He had never felt this before, not even in Jiang Gu!

“Do you really think that you have the qualifications to be with Yan Ruoxue?” Han Wei narrowed his eyes and said.

“Other than Old Mister Yan, no one in the entire Yan family supports you!”

“Now, Old Mister Yan is alive, so he can still make the decision. What happens after Old Mister Yan dies?”

“I’ve asked someone to do a divination. Old Mister Yan’s future lifespan is at most two years! When that time comes, what right do you have to marry Yan Ruoxue?”

After he heard Han Wei’s words, Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

He took a deep breath and said, “I’m indeed unworthy of Yan Ruoxue now. The Yan family also has the right to look down on me.”

“But I believe that before long, I will definitely be qualified to marry Yan Ruoxue,” Qin Yu said in a neither servile nor overbearing manner.

When Han Wei heard this, it was as if he had heard the biggest joke in the world!

“The people living at the bottom are really pitiful. Some minor fame in Chuzhou has already blinded your eyes,” Han Wei mocked.

“Don’t tell me you really think of yourself as a genius? In Jingdu, there are many people like you!” Han Wei shouted angrily.

Qin Yu said coldly, “I do have a lot of confidence in myself.”

“Confidence?” Han Wei’s expression turned cold.

“Fine, I’ll shatter your confidence today!”

After an explosive shout, Han Wei took a step forward!

The terrifying pressure instantly caused Qin Yu’s bones to emit cracking sounds!

Qin Yu’s forehead was covered in layers of secret sweat. Even his bodily movements were suppressed!

“I’ll let you know today that trash is just trash.” Han Wei raised his fist and thrust it over!

Qin Yu didn’t dare to be negligent. He hurriedly activated his Saintly Body Technique and the Archaic Sacred Fist to meet it head-on!

Qin Yu used all of his trump cards right from the start. This was enough to show Qin Yu’s cautiousness!

“Boom!”

The two fists collided, creating a huge explosion!

The golden light on Qin Yu’s fists was directly shattered!

Just a casual punch shattered Qin Yu’s trump card!

“Boom!”

With another punch, Qin Yu’s body was sent flying!

The inner strength spread throughout Qin Yu’s entire body almost in an instant!

Only the fist was injured, but Qin Yu could clearly feel that his entire body was injured!

“King of Chuzhou? That’s all you have?” Han Wei sneered.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He wanted to get up from the ground, but he found that he didn’t have any strength at all!

Han Wei walked in front of Qin Yu and stepped on Qin Yu’s head.

“This world isn’t something ordinary people like you can understand,” Han Wei said coldly.

“Even your trump card was easily crushed by me. What right do you have to fight with me?”

“If I want to kill you, I can crush you right now!”

Qin Yu struggled desperately, but his body couldn’t move!

Han Wei’s feet rolled over Qin Yu’s body. He narrowed his eyes and said, “Trash, give up. Whether it is your identity, background, or even your most proud talent, they aren’t worth mentioning in front of me.”

Qin Yu glared at Han Wei. He gritted his teeth and said, “You can get to where you are today only because of the resources your family gave you!”

“If you were like me, who was born with nothing, you would probably be worse off than me!”

“I only used half a year to get to where I am from having nothing. And you, with the endless resources of the big families in Jingdu, are only an Inner Strength Grandmaster.”

“Which one of us is trash?!”
