Chapter 540: Crushing Defeat! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

His body was bathed in golden light and not a single wound could be seen.

Not only did his internal qi not weaken, but it was also even stronger than before!

“What... What’s going on?” Someone exclaimed!

“Could it be... that he has also stepped into the rank of Martial Marquis?”

On the stage, Xia Hang’s expression instantly turned ashen!

He collapsed onto the chair in despair.

The thing he was most afraid of had happened!

Qin Yu actually had a secret technique to forcefully increase his strength!

One had to know that to the chaotic body, the Martial Marquis realm made worlds of difference!

After stepping into Martial Marquis, the chaotic body officially welcomed its own strong stage.

At this stage, the chaotic body could suppress most of the physiques!

No matter what physique it was, they couldn’t compete with the chaotic body at this stage!

The white light gradually dissipated, and Qin Yu’s sturdy body finally appeared in front of everyone.

Qin Yu looked coldly at Han Wei, and murderous internal qi burst out from his eyes.

“Is this the power of a Martial Marquis?” Qin Yu felt the surging internal qi in his body, and he couldn’t help but look forward to it.

Although it was only a thin line, the gap was too big.

At this moment, Qin Yu felt a sense of arrogance inside!

He even felt that if everyone present attacked together, it wouldn’t be worth mentioning!

Not far away, Han Wei stared at Qin Yu with a trace of unwillingness in his eyes!

“You... how did you do it?!” Han Wei gnashed his teeth and said.

Qin Yu said coldly, “You’d better ask in h*ll.”

As he spoke, Qin Yu walked towards Han Wei step by step.

Han Wei revealed a crazed expression as he roared with all his might, “So what if you’ve stepped into the rank of Martial Marquis? I, Han Wei, won’t be afraid of you!”

Han Wei waved his hand, casually unleashing a killing move that contained murderous internal qi!

Rays of light shot towards Qin Yu!

The terrifying power almost tore the air apart, and cracks appeared on the ground!

Qin Yu was expressionless as he continued walking towards Han Wei.

Just as the rays of light were about to touch Qin Yu, Qin Yu casually waved his hand.

“Slap!”

A crisp sound rang out as the rays of light were dispersed by a single slap!

“How... how is this possible?!” Han Wei’s expression changed drastically! Layers of sweat appeared on his forehead!

And the expressions of the surrounding people, including Martial Marquis Bai, were somewhat ugly!

Even if they were to go up, they probably wouldn’t dare to underestimate this killing technique!

“I don’t believe it!” Han Wei roared crazily, and countless killing moves smashed towards Qin Yu!

However, this couldn’t stop Qin Yu from advancing. His golden physical body was extremely powerful. He wasn’t afraid of Han Wei’s killing moves at all!

“Ah!!!”

Han Wei’s expression was filled with madness. With a loud roar, his two hands held up a disc-like light!

This technique was also inherited from Han Xiu. The power contained within it could destroy the world!

Just the condensation of the moves made people feel a trace of fear. Even Zhuang Teng and the others were affected!

“Everyone, join hands and protect the venue,” Many of the Martial Marquises had solemn expressions on their faces as they hurriedly said.

“Go to h*ll!!” Han Wei furiously roared. He waved both his hands forward, and that ray of light instantly smashed towards Qin Yu from all directions!

Qin Yu’s expression was cold. He clenched his fist and shouted, “Break!”

In an instant, golden light rose in all directions. Qin Yu clenched his golden fist and smashed it down with a force that could crush wood!

“Boom!”

With just one punch, the light condensed by Han Wei was shattered instantly!

Meanwhile, Qin Yuwas still walking forward steadily.

Han Wei’s face revealed fear. At this moment, he was really afraid!

“How is this possible...” Han Wei kept repeating these words.

“You, Qin Yu, are just an ant at the bottom. What right do you have to go against me?!” Han Wei roared while almost breaking down. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

But what responded to him was only a crisp slap!

This slap ractured half of Han Wei’s face!

Han Wei tried to struggle, but he couldn’t hurt Qin Yu at all!

“You keep calling me a lowly ant. Where did you get this sense of superiority from?” Qin Yu looked at Han Wei coldly.

“F * ck you!” Han Wei clenched his fist and smashed it at Qin Yu’s face fiercely!

Qin Yu raised his hand and easily grabbed Han Wei’s fist.

Han Wei gritted his teeth. He wanted to break free, but he found that he couldn’t break free at all!

“How... how could this be...” Han Wei’s face was filled with unwillingness.

Qin Yu sneered. “Do you regret not killing me earlier?”

“Impossible, impossible...” Han Wei didn’t listen to him and kept repeating these words.

“I am the young master of the Han family. I am someone that was born to be above you!” Han Wei roared crazily.

“You bunch of ants should kneel before me and submit! What right do you have to oppose me?! You bunch of...”

“Slap!”

Before Han Wei could finish his words, his chin was smashed by a slap.

“What era is this? Are you still living in the Qing Dynasty?” Qin Yu looked down at Han Wei from above.

Han Wei was in extreme anguish. All of his arrogance and pride had been shattered at this moment!

“Come, kneel down. Let me see how an arrogant young master like your will beg for mercy.” Qin Yu released Han Wei and said coldly.

Han Wei had already lost the ability to resist. The power of the Martial Marquis on his body also began to slowly disappear.

“Son!” Above, Han Meng roared even louder!

Yan Sihai’s expression finally turned completely cold.

“Let go of my son!” Han Meng stood up angrily.

Qin Yu shot a glance at Han Wei, who was lying on the ground like a dead dog, and sneered. “Don’t worry, I won’t kill him, because he’s no longer a threat to me.”

“You!”

Han Meng’s face flushed, but he had no way to refute him!

No one had expected that the high and mighty Young Master Han would end up like this!

The battle that had been hyped up for an entire year seemed to have come to an end at this moment.

“After Qin Yu stepped into the rank of a Martial Marquis, Han Wei didn’t even have the strength to retaliate. How terrifying.” Zhuang Teng couldn’t help but exclaim.

Chu Heng also nodded his head and said, “If this kid really steps into the ranks of Martial Marquis, it would be a disaster for us.”

“Either we get rid of him, or don’t become enemies with him.”

Even though that was the case, the two sides had long been at loggerheads, so how could there be a chance to ease things up?

With an imposing appearance, Qin Yu stood in the middle of the battlefield and swept his gaze forward.

“I won. According to the agreement, I will take Ruoxue away today,” Qin Yu said coldly.
