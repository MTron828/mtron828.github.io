Brother Mang raised his eyebrows and said, “What? Do you think I’m joking with you again?”

Gao Tingting, who wasn’t far away, also hurriedly shouted, “Yes, hit him! He was the one who ordered it!”

Brother Mang snorted nonchalantly and pointed at Qin Yu. He said, “I’ll wait for you in the arena.”

After saying this, Brother Mang turned his head and walked towards the arena.

“No need.” At this time, Qin Yu said nonchalantly.

“It will only be a matter of a few minutes. There’s no need to go to the ring. It’s too troublesome,” Qin Yu said.

A fifth stage inner strength martial artist simply didn’t have the qualifications to fight with Qin Yu.

But when Brother Mang heard this, he thought that Qin Yu had admitted defeat.

He turned around and smiled. “It seems that you are quite self-aware. Okay, then I’ll do as you say.”

Then, Brother Mang quickly walked to Qin Yu. He rubbed his fist and said with a sneer, “Today, I...”

“Bang!”

Before Brother Mang could finish his words, Qin Yu suddenly raised his hand and slapped Brother Mang’s face!

Before Brother Mang could even react, his entire body was sent flying for more than ten meters.

Half of his facial bones were directly shattered, and he fell to the ground without standing up again.

The venue was completely silent.

No one dared to believe this scene.

They didn’t even know what had happened.

“This... That’s it?” Li Yan swallowed hard and looked at Qin Yu in shock.

Qin Yu, on the other hand, was calm and collected, as if he had done something beneath mentioning.

“Let’s go.” Qin Yu looked at Li Yan and the others, then strode towards the door.

This time, no one dared to stop Qin Yu, and all of them obediently retreated to the side.

Brother Mang was the number one martial artist in the underground boxing ring. In front of Qin Yu, he didn’t even have the chance to fight back, so who dared to stop him?

The few of them swaggered out of the underground boxing ring.

After they left, Li Yan couldn’t help but say excitedly, “Mr. Qin, I didn’t expect you to be so impressive! How unbelievable!”

Qin Yu smiled and didn’t say anything.

To put it bluntly, this underground boxing ring was just for entertainment. Real martial artists wouldn’t come to such a place at all.

After such an incident happened, no one was in the mood to play, so they directly dispersed.

That night, Qin Yu went to bed early and planned to return to Jiangcheng the next day.

At this time, Shen Yun was sitting in his office with a livid look on his face.

“Dad, what happened?” Shen Tian asked with some confusion.

Shen Yun glanced at him and said with some fatigue, “The Shen family’s financial chain is broken.”

“Huh?” Shen Tian was stunned. “How is this possible?”

Shen Yun gritted his teeth and said with a cold expression, “It’s all because of Qin Yu! All of this is his doing!”

Following that, Shen Yun told Shen Tian what happened.

Shen Tian was even more furious after hearing it!

He had always been so arrogant and bossy that he treated ordinary people as ants!

Now that his life was being ruined by an ant, how could Shen Tian not be angry?!

“This must be Yan Ruoxue’s doing!” Shen Tian said through gritted teeth.

Shen Yun knew it clearly in his heart.

Without Yan Ruoxue’s help, no one could grow so fast.

However, what could the Shen family do?

“If I have no other choice, I can only ask for a reconciliation.” Shen Yun took a deep breath and said somewhat unwillingly.

“Ask for a reconciliation? F * ck asking for a reconciliation!” Shen Tian said angrily.

“If it were up to me, I would directly tie Yan Ruoxue up and teach her a lesson! Otherwise, she would keep acting too big for her britches!” Shen Tian said with a bit of viciousness.

When he heard this, Shen Yun hurriedly waved his hand and said, “Shut up! Shen Tian, I’m warning you, don’t you ever say that again in the future! Otherwise, it will bring disaster to our family!”

Shen Yun said impatiently, but unfortunately, Shen Tian didn’t listen to a single word he said.

His mind raced, and no one knew what he was thinking about.

“Dad, even if you go beg Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue, will they let you off the hook?” Shen Tian snorted coldly.

Shen Yun sighed. He rubbed his forehead and said, “I can only find Mr. Wu to fix this.”

Uncle Wu was, after all, a high-ranking official in the military district, and he had a friendship with the Yan family.

If Uncle Wu stepped forward, there was still room for remedy.

Currently, Shen Yun didn’t have the mood to think about revenge at all. He was thinking about how to protect the Shen family.

Shen Tian, who was beside him, snorted coldly and walked out without saying anything. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Shen Yun took out his phone and dialed Uncle Wu’s number.

He told Uncle Wu the whole story over the phone.

Uncle Wu fell into silence after hearing it.

Uncle Wu didn’t expect that the prominent Shen family would be forced into such a situation by someone as insignificant as Qin Yu.

“You have to help me!” Shen Yun pleaded on the phone.

Uncle Wu sighed and said, “Alright, I’ll go to Jiangcheng tomorrow and treat you and Qin Yu to a meal. But... Old Shen, you have to act more humble.”

“I understand. Don’t worry,” Shen Yun agreed.

On the other side, Shen Tian had already walked out of his house and all the way to the bar.

“Shen Tian, what’s wrong? Are you unhappy?” His lackey, Zhao Gang, asked considerately.

Shen Tian didn’t say anything. He looked at Zhao Gang and suddenly thought of a bad idea.

“Zhao Gang, do you want to make a fortune? Do you want to cooperate with our family?” Shen Tian asked with a smile.

Zhao Gang was stunned and hurriedly nodded. “Shen Tian, I’ve been dreaming of it! I just lack an opportunity!”

Shen Tian patted Zhao Gang’s shoulder and said, “Now, your opportunity has come. As long as you help me do one thing, I’ll let you cooperate with the Shen Family!”

“Really? Shen Tian, it’s my honor to be able to work for you!” Zhao Gang hurriedly said.

A sinister light flashed in Shen Tian’s eyes. He looked at Zhao Gang and coldly said, “I want you to find a few people to kidnap Yan Ruoxue!”

When he heard this, Zhao Gang’s expression instantly became extremely ugly, and he even suddenly shivered.

“Shen Tian, don’t joke around. Yan Ruoxue is the granddaughter of the Yan family...” Zhao Gang said with some fear.

Shen Tian said with a cold expression, “What are you afraid of? We’re not hurting her. We’re just scaring her.”

“Find a few reliable people and imprison her for a few days, then let her go. What can happen?”

“Besides, no one will know about this except for you and me. We can totally keep it a secret!”
