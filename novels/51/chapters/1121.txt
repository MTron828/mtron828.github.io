Chapter 1122: Chapter 1,122. The time had come 

Jiang he nodded slightly. He could not help but feel some admiration for the pavilion master’s methods.

Tian Zong had temporarily moved into the Heaven Gate. With the Pavilion Master’s hard work, he was able to temporarily keep the Heaven Gate safe.

In the next few days, Tian Zong spent most of his time in the mortal world, living quite happily.

Everyone could not help but be greatly shocked by this. They had originally thought that it would be a massacre, but never had they imagined that it would end up like this.

“Could it be that the two of them have reconciled? Tian Zong has joined the Heaven Gate?”

“How is that possible? Tian Zong is a mighty figure. Why would he take a fancy to a small Heaven Gate?”

“I heard that it was the pavilion master of the Medicine God Pavilion who was meddling in the matter that caused Tian Zong to not make a move. I don’t know where Qin Yu has gone to, but he’s temporarily not at the Heaven Gate.”

“That’s right. Tian Zong gave the heaven gate five days. If Qin Yu doesn’t return in five days, there will definitely be a big fight.”

On the surface, it seemed calm and peaceful, but in reality, the entire Heaven Gate was in a state of panic.

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

In the pavilion master’s room, Jiang he said in a deep voice, “There are only two days left. Can Qin Yu return before then?”

“I don’t know. No one can guarantee such a thing.”The pavilion master took a deep breath.

Jiang he said in a deep voice, “If Qin Yu still doesn’t show up after five days, what should we do?”

A trace of worry appeared on the Pavilion Master’s face.

Not everything could be under control, so she didn’t know what to do.

“Let’s take it one step at a time. I will try my best to stall him,”said the pavilion master.

The entire Heaven Gate was divided into an extremely uneasy atmosphere.

Tian Zong, on the other hand, was living quite comfortably. He had delicious food and beautiful women by his side, so he was living an extremely happy life.

“I haven’t enjoyed such a life for a long time. This is really a perfect era,”Tian Zong couldn’t help but sigh.

How could there be so many things to enjoy a thousand years ago?

“Master, that Qin Yu...”Yun long opened his mouth as if he wanted to remind Tian Zong.

Tian Zong said lightly, “Don’t worry, I Won’t forget. He stole the strange flower. He must die.”

Yun long heaved a sigh of relief, and a trace of resentment flashed across his face.

“He, Qin Yu, has played me many times. I absolutely can not let him off!”Yun long gnashed his teeth and said.

...

Under the Clear Bay’s seabed.

Qin Yu had already swallowed over forty heavenly origin pills.

These forty over Sky origin pills had finally allowed Qin Yu to touch the edge of the middle stage of the martial saint stage.

“According to this progress, I should be able to break through to the middle stage of the martial saint stage within five pills.”Qin Yu took a deep breath. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

He raised his head and looked up, saying in a low voice, “I don’t know how much time has passed. Hopefully... that mighty figure has not appeared yet.”

In order to save time, Qin Yu stuffed all five heavenly origin pills into his mouth, preparing to break through in one go.

Soon, it was the evening of the fourth day. There were only a few hours left before the time agreed upon by Pavilion Master and Tian Zong.

“I’m afraid it will be very difficult for Qin Yu to rush back,”Jiang he said in a deep voice.

Pavilion master nodded and said, “A few hours. Just this part of the journey alone is not enough time.”

“What should we do? Even if we join forces, we definitely won’t be a match for him,”Jiang he said in a low voice.

Right now, they couldn’t find anyone they could ask for help from. A mighty figure was simply too terrifying. He was a figure that stood above the current era. It was simply a blow that could reduce dimensions.

“Chang Mang is here.”

At this moment, Xu Huaigu walked in. Behind him was a muscular man that looked like an iron tower.

“Greetings, pavilion master. Greetings, senior Jiang He.”Chang Mang cupped his hands.

Jiang he frowned and said, “Why are you here at this time? Don’t you know...”

“I only came because I knew!”Chang Mang scolded.

“Isn’t it almost time? As Qin Yu’s brother, how can I sit idly by!”

Hearing Chang Mang’s words, pavilion master didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

“Chang Mang, do you know who that Tian Zong is?”Pavilion master said helplessly.

“I don’t care who he is! At most, I will fight him. where is he?”Chang Mang said as he rolled up his sleeves.

Everyone in the room could not help but laugh.

“Chang Mang, thank you for your kindness, but there is no need to make such a meaningless sacrifice.”Pavilion master shook his head.

Chang Mang opened her mouth, but just as she was about to speak, pavilion master waved her hand and said, “Don’t worry, I’ve already thought of a countermeasure.”

With that, pavilion master took out her cell phone and made a call.

This call was made to Xia hang.

She said over the phone, “Xia hang, immediately arrange for someone to post on the martial arts forum.”

Pavilion master spent more than ten minutes to explain to Xia hang.

After making this call, pavilion master opened the Martial Arts Forum and waited for the news.

“What does this mean?”Jiang he asked doubtfully.

Pavilion master glanced at Jiang he and only said four words, “People’s words are terrible.”

Jiang he seemed to understand pavilion master’s intention. He said with some worry, “To mighty figures, you and I are both ants.”

“Moreover, the holy region is about to open. Why would Tian Zong care about what the people in the world say?”

Pavilion master smiled and said, “Since he promised to give me five days, it means that he cares and cares very much.”

Soon, one post after another appeared on the martial arts forum.

Most of these posts were about Tian Zong’s benevolence and the state of mind of a mighty figure.

“A mighty figure is a mighty figure. He is completely different from a martial saint. At least, he would not harm the innocent!”

“Yes, this is the state of mind of an ancient mighty figure. How can it be compared to those martial saints?”

“How about an ancient mighty figure? They are all lofty figures like the stars! To be able to get to know such a figure is a lifetime’s fortune!”

Jiang he frowned and said, “Is that enough?”

“Of course not.”Pavilion master shook his head.

“I have made arrangements in advance. A few days ago, I asked the heaven gate disciples to deliberately spread similar words to express their admiration for Tian Zong. I think Tian Zong must have heard about it long ago.”

Jiang he could not help but be dumbstruck when he heard it.

Such a method was simply unheard of to Jiang he.
