Seeing how stubborn Qin Yu was, the two of them didn’t say anything more, but their eyes were filled with regret.

To Qin Yu, this Chinese knotweed was extremely important. If he could obtain it, Qin Yu would have full confidence in breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Stage.

Once he reached the Foundation Establishment Stage, Qin Yu wouldn’t be afraid of the Liu family at all.

“Congratulations, Mr. Qin, for buying a Chinese knotweed at a price of one billion!” The host on the stage shouted excitedly.

This was the finale of the auction, so the auction was over after the deal was done.

The crowd began to disperse. Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue also got up and walked towards the backstage.

When they passed by Liu Shihui, Liu Shihui suddenly said coldly, “You’re quite bold. No one in South City dares to offend our family.”

“Really? As the first one, I am honored,” Qin Yu said in a neither servile nor haughty manner.

Liu Shihui sneered and said, “You’re really too ignorantly brazen. I hope you won’t regret it.”

Qin Yu didn’t pay any more attention to him. He would deal with whatever came his way.

Soon, Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue came backstage.

“Wait for me.” Yan Ruoxue pulled Qin Yu back.

After saying that, she ran to the side and dialed Yan Yongxiu’s number.

As soon as the call was picked up, Yan Yongxiu smiled and said, “Ruoxue, why did you suddenly think of calling me?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Dad, transfer 1 billion into my card quickly,” Yan Ruoxue said.

Yan Yongxiu was stunned at the other end and said somewhat helplessly, “Why do you suddenly want so much money? Is something the matter?”

“Yes, there’s something important. Quickly transfer it over.” After saying that, Yan Ruoxue hurriedly hung up the phone.

Qin Yu was dumbfounded when he saw this.

1 billion sounded as simple as 10 yuan in Yan Ruoxue’s mouth...

Not long after, Yan Yongxiu transferred the money into Yan Ruoxue’s account.

“Let’s go.” Yan Ruoxue blinked and said.

Qin Yu didn’t know what to say, but Qin Yu was afraid that he wouldn’t be able to repay Yan Ruoxue’s kindness.

After completing the procedures, the two of them walked out with the auction items.

“Uh, isn’t this jade pendant for me?” Yan Ruoxue blinked and said.

Qin Yu said mysteriously, “I can’t give it to you for the time being. I have to deal with it briefly.”

When Yan Ruoxue heard this, she said, “Oh, then you have to hurry up.”

“Huh? Why?”

“Nothing.”

” ...”

The auction wasn’t held every day after all, so the location was relatively remote. Their surroundings were full of forests.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and felt the spiritual energy from the surroundings. He couldn’t help but feel a little excited.

“South City is really a good place.” Qin Yu, feeling a sense of pleasure and comfort, raised his hands.

“Yes.” Yan Ruoxue looked at the side of Qin Yu’s face and said with a smile.

“When we grow old in the future, we should come to South City to buy a house,” Qin Yu said jokingly.

“Okay, then you have to work hard,” Yan Ruoxue said as she started the car.

“Definitely!”

At this time, Liu Shihui was sitting in a car and looking in Yan Ruoxue’s direction coldly.

“It’s a Jingdu license, Young Master Liu. It seems that these two people are from Jingdu. Shouldn’t we be more cautious...” The old servant frowned.

Liu Shihui said with a cold expression, “So what if they came from Jingdu? If I kill them, who will trace it to me?!”

“I must get this Chinese knotweed!” Liu Shihui punched the car seat fiercely.

Seeing this, the old servant didn’t say anything further.

He knew Liu Shihui’s personality very clearly. No one could change his mind once he decided on something.

Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue drove slowly. They enjoyed the sea breeze with comfort.

At this moment, three cars suddenly appeared in front of them and blocked their way.

Qin Yu frowned and was about to speak when he noticed another car slowly driving over from behind.

“It must be Liu Shihui,” Qin Yu said with narrowed eyes.

Then, Qin Yu looked at Yan Ruoxue and warned, “Wait for me in the car. Don’t get out no matter what happens, understand?”

“Yes, yes, I know. I believe in you!” Yan Ruoxue said with her fists clenched.

Qin Yu got out of the car.

He stood in front of the car and quietly waited for Liu Shihui’s arrival.

Soon, Liu Shihui’s car stopped in front of Qin Yu.

“I told you that you would regret it.” Liu Shihui got out of the car with his old servant.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Do I regret it? How can you tell that I regret it?”

“Sharp-tongued kid,” Liu Shihui said coldly.

“I’ll give you a chance now. Return the Chinese knotweed to me and all I will do is cut off your legs. I can spare your life,” Liu Shihui said coldly.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “The Liu family is really overbearing. I spent money to buy it. Why should I give it to you?”

Liu Shihui said angrily, “What I like is mine! Don’t be shameless!”

“You’re the one who is shameless.” Qin Yu’s expression was ice-cold, and his internal qi quickly rose to the maximum.

“Young Master Liu, let me take care of him.” At this time, the old servant beside Liu Shihui said.

Liu Shihui lit a cigarette and said coldly, “Since he’s so fearless, kill him.”

“Yes, Young Master.” The old servant nodded.

He walked to Qin Yu slowly and said with a sinister smile, “I know you have some tricks up your sleeve, your mediocre abilities are nothing in front of me.”

“You really talk a lot of nonsense,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“If you want to fight, then hurry up. I still have to go back to sleep.”

The old servant laughed and said, “Ignorant people are truly fearless. Good... Then I’ll let you, a bug, know what true strength is!”
