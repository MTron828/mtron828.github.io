Chapter 398: I Am Qin Yu Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“You’d better not lie to us. Otherwise, you know the consequences.” Before Qin Yu could speak, Mr. Tang warned him.

Qin Yu glanced at Mr. Tang and said slowly, “I’m trying to build a future for myself. If... I can come out alive, can I also work for the Yan family?”

Lying without batting an eye was a piece of cake for Qin Yu. It wasn’t worth mentioning at all.

At the same time, Qin Yu used the power of his divine sense to convey the same message to Mr. Tang.

Yan Haoran glanced at Mr. Tang, as if asking.

Mr. Tang hurriedly nodded and said, “Young Master Yan, he indeed thinks so.”

The corners of Yan Haoran’s mouth couldn’t help but curl into a playful smile.

“An Inner Strength Past Master wants to serve the Yan family?” Yan Haoran sneered.

“An Inner Strength Past Master is just an ant. You’re simply daydreaming!” Jing Shihong immediately said.

In order to make his words seem more realistic, Qin Yu continued, “I’m just giving it a try. If I can really join the Yan family, I won’t have to worry about my future...”

Yan Haoran raised his eyebrows and said indifferently, “Seeing that you are so sincere, I can consider it. The premise is that you can find the treasure for me from down here.”

Qin Yu pretended to be excited and said, “Don’t worry! I will do my best!”

Everyone walked to the giant pit in unison.

As soon as they got close to the giant pit, the terrifying dark energy almost swallowed them!

Not to mention using inner strength, even their physical bodies couldn’t withstand it!

Yan Haoran kicked a rock into the pit. The moment the rock entered, it was immediately turned into dust.

“It’s that terrifying?” Yan Haoran frowned slightly.

“This... If my physical body enters the pit, I’m afraid I’ll be crushed into pieces!” Someone beside him exclaimed.

Qin Yu also pretended to be afraid and said, “Young... Young Master Yan, I’m only an Inner Strength Past Master. If I go in... I’m afraid I’ll die there.”

“What are you afraid of?! This dark energy might not have any effect on the body.” Jing Shihong kicked Qin Yu.

“That’s right. Generally speaking, the power of the dark energy won’t cause too much damage to the body.” Someone beside him also said.

Even though that was the case, no one dared to go forward.

“Cannon fodder, it’s time to play your role. Go and see if the dark energy can harm the human body,” Jing Shihong sneered.

Qin Yu pretended to be afraid and said, “I... I don’t dare to.”

“You don’t dare to? Then go die!” Jing Shihong berated.

Qin Yu hurriedly said, “Okay, I’ll go! I’ll go! But... I have to take her with me!”

Qin Yu pointed in Xiao Yu’s direction.

Xiao Yu glared at Qin Yu fiercely, spat on the ground, and scolded, “Loser kiss *ss!”

Qin Yu ignored Xiao Yu and looked at Yan Haoran eagerly.

Yan Haoran was silent for a moment and then said, “No, if she can’t withstand this dark energy, it’ll be troublesome for us. You’d better go down and test it first.”

Qin Yu secretly had a bad feeling.

It seemed that Yan Haoran wasn’t so easy to fool.

“Young Master Yan, you’d better let me bring her down with me,” Qin Yu muttered.

“Otherwise... I’m afraid.”

“Cut the crap!” Jing Shihong scolded.

“You’d better go down quickly, or I’ll kick you to death!” The people next to him scolded one after another.

Qin Yu knew that he couldn’t fool them, so he sighed and said, “Alright, but... I have to take something from her. Can I?”

“Take what?” Yan Haoran frowned and said.

Qin Yu said in a low voice, “I’ve never touched a woman in my life, and I’m really unwilling to die like this.”

“I... I want to take a strand of hair from her. Can I?” Qin Yu said with an embarrassed smile.

Hearing this, everyone immediately burst into laughter.

“What a useless thing! Are you satisfied with just a strand of hair?”

“No wonder he’s wearing a green hat on his head. He’s a loser.”

Even Xiao Yu felt nauseous.

How could there be such a man in the world?

“Okay?” Qin Yu looked at Yan Haoran with an embarrassed smile.

Yan Haoran nodded and said, “I can satisfy you.”

Qin Yu hurriedly walked in front of Xiao Yu.

“Don’t touch me!” At this time, Xiao Yu couldn’t help but shout.

Qin Yu ignored Xiao Yu. He walked to Xiao Yu’s side and hugged Xiao Yu!

“Let go of me!” Xiao Yu felt embarrassed and angry. She kept struggling.

“Hahaha! This kid is quite greedy.”

“How is it? Is it comfortable to hold her?”

Qin Yu quickly said, “Yes, it’s really comfortable!”

“Disgusting!” Xiao Yu couldn’t help but curse.

Qin Yu leaned toward Xiao Yu’s ear and whispered, “I’m Qin Yu. Think of a way to accompany me down there later. I’ll think of a way to save you.”

Hearing this, Xiao Yu was stunned.

Just as she was about to speak, Qin Yu hurriedly said, “Continue to struggle! Don’t let them see through it.”

Xiao Yu was stunned, but quickly resumed the struggle.

“Let go of me! Don’t touch me! You disgusting jerk!” Xiao Yu struggled desperately.

However, Qin Yu held Xiao Yu and showed no intention of letting go.

“Enough.” Yan Haoran frowned.

Only then did Qin Yu let go of Xiao Yu.

“Are you satisfied? Hurry up and go down. Don’t waste time,” Yan Haoran said coldly.

Qin Yu nodded and walked to the side of the huge pit. Just as he was about to jump down, Xiao Yu shouted, “I want to go down too!”

“You want to go down too?” Yan Haoran frowned.

“Little girl, you will die if you go down,” Jing Shihong said indifferently.

Xiao Yu snorted and said, “To tell you the truth, I went down there before. It’s no big deal!”

“You went down there before? Little girl, you can’t lie in front of me.” Mr. Tang raised his eyebrows.

“Who’s lying to you? I did go down there!” Xiao Yu said stubbornly.

After saying that, Xiao Yu glared at Qin Yu and said, “I’ll kill him after I go down there!”

Yan Haoran couldn’t help but frown. He glanced at Qin Yu and said, “Did you say something to her?”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “I. . . I did talk to her. I said... her body is so soft...” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Hahaha! No wonder you made the little girl so angry.” The people beside him couldn’t help but laugh, and their vigilance toward Xiao Yu was also much lower.

However, Yan Haoran was a cautious person.

He thought for a moment, then looked at Mr. Tang and said, “Aren’t you a spiritual master? See if she is lying.”

“No problem, Young Master Yan. Leave it to me!” Mr. Tang patted his chest and said.

After saying that, Mr. Tang walked toward Xiao Yu.

His finger lit up a little light, and then he pointed at the center of Xiao Yu’s eyebrows.

“Oh no!” Qin Yu’s expression suddenly changed!
