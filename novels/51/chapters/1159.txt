Chapter 1160: Chapter 1,160, the only remaining blood 

Su Qi tried to flirt with him in an attempt to achieve her goal.

However, the chains on her body made her unable to move at all.

Su Qi had never expected that she, a mighty almighty, would actually rely on her physical body to win a glimmer of hope for survival.

Unfortunately, Qin Yu did not fall for this trick.

Everything was just a skeleton, not worth mentioning.

What he wanted was a soul connection.

“You guys should continue to enjoy this pain,”Qin Yu said with a cold smile.

“Don’t... Don’t, please save us...”a higher-up begged with a trembling voice.

“Or... or you can kill us!”A higher-up seemed unable to bear the pain and hurriedly shouted.

Qin Yu sneered, “Gu Xinghe is right. It’s too easy for you to die like this. Enjoy it slowly.”

After saying that, Qin Yu looked at Yan Yongfu and asked, “Where’s the blood?”

“Let’s leave this place first,”Yan Yongfu said.

Qin Yu nodded and agreed.

This was the first secret realm after all, so Yan Yongfu was very familiar with this place.

He led the way in front and soon arrived at the passage.

After opening the passage, the two of them entered it and quickly disappeared from the first mystic realm.

After escaping from the first mystic realm, Yan Yongfu said coldly, “Follow me.”

Qin Yu glanced at Yan Yongfu and said, “Where are you going?”

Yan Yongfu said indifferently, “I had already predicted that there would be a disaster one day, so I had long prepared a place to hide. Only I know that place.”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said mockingly, “A crafty rabbit has three burrows.”

“Now is not the time to talk about this. Hurry up and leave,”Yan Yongfu said.

Qin Yu nodded. He followed behind Yan Yongfu and fled to the east.

The two of them left Jingdu and came to a seaside.

Standing by the seaside, Yan Yongfu raised his hand and began to feel in the air in front of him.

A few minutes later, a ray of light lit up, and an entrance appeared in front of the two of them.

“Mystic Realm?”Qin Yu was slightly surprised.

Yan Yongfu snorted, “This is the mystic realm that I personally created. Although it is only an extremely small mystic realm, it is the best place to hide.”

After saying this, Yan Yongfu took the lead and stepped into the mystic realm.

Qin Yu did not waste any more time and followed closely behind, arriving at the mystic realm.

Just as Yan Yongfu said.

This mystic realm was very small. Rather than calling it a mystic realm, it was more like a mansion.

The entire mystic realm was only a few hundred square meters in size, and the decorations inside were extremely crude.

“Where’s the blood?”Qin Yu looked at Yan Yongfu and asked.

Yan Yongfu pointed to the courtyard behind him and said, “It’s inside.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Qin Yu didn’t have the time to waste. The blood was very useful, and it was also the key to Qin Yu’s victory over Gu Xinghe.

“Lead the way,”Qin Yu urged.

The two of them passed through the hall and came to the courtyard behind them.

They saw a porcelain jar in the courtyard.

There was internal Qi flowing on the jar, as if it was sealed by some secret method.

Yan Yongfu walked to the jar and placed his hand on the tube.

The mist that lingered around the jar began to disperse, revealing the true appearance of the jar.

The Jar was extraordinary. It was unknown what material it was made of, but it could seal the flow of internal Qi to the maximum.

Then, Yan Yongfu reached out and opened the jar.

There was a pool of bright red in the jar.

The pool of blood was extremely fresh and it was rolling slightly in the jar.

Smelling that familiar smell, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little heartache, and a trace of anger appeared on his face.

He suddenly turned around and grabbed Yan Yongfu’s neck, lifting him up into the air.

The huge force made it difficult for Yan Yongfu to breathe!

His face quickly turned red, and his hands and feet kept shaking.

“You... said... not to kill me...”Yan Yongfu said these words with difficulty.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and threw him to the side.

“It’s a pity that I can’t kill you,”Qin Yu said coldly.

He looked at the fresh blood in the jar and said coldly, “This is all your doing.”

Yan Yongfu coughed violently and said, “If it weren’t for us, you wouldn’t have had the chance to touch this fresh blood...”

“Bullsh * T!”Qin Yu slapped Yan Yongfu’s face.

“If it weren’t for you, Ruoxue and I wouldn’t have been separated,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Yan Yongfu knew it was useless to say anything, so he just shut his mouth obediently.

Looking at the fresh blood in the jar, Qin Yu took a deep breath.

He waved his hand and kept the fresh blood in the jar.

“According to the information we received, the combination of you and Yan Ruoxue will erupt with an extremely terrifying power,”Yan Yongfu said from the side.

“But we don’t know exactly what kind of power it will erupt with. Speaking of which, I’m rather looking forward to it.”

Qin Yu glanced at Yan Yongfu and sneered, “Yan Yongfu, you have to live well. Sooner or later, I’ll have to kill you with my own hands.”

Yan yongfu laughed and said, “You’ve already sworn to the Heavenly Dao. I’m afraid you won’t have the chance.”

“That might not be the case,”Qin Yu sneered.

“If I can ignore the Heavenly Dao’s punishment one day, I’ll definitely kill you then.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and walked into the room.

Yan Yongfu looked at Qin Yu in a daze, and he couldn’t help but frown slightly.

Those who could step into the almighty realm were all geniuses.

Especially in such a big environment like Earth.

Even though most of the resources had been obtained by the eight of them, wanting to step into the almighty realm wasn’t something that could be achieved just by relying on resources. It was more about talent.

It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that anyone who stepped into the Almighty realm was a rare existence.

Especially Yan Yongfu, who was the leader of the eight.

As long as he was still alive, Yan Yongfu had every chance.
