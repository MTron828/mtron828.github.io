2497 Revered Qi’s Reward

The disparity before and after the Tribulation Fifth Level was like the difference between night and day.

However, there was a vast difference in their strength. At the Tribulation Sixth Level, one was in harmony with the natural order of all things.

Under this cultivation realm, the body would refine the power of the origin.

The power of the origin would become a part of the body, and the soul would undergo a qualitative change after refining the power of the origin. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

At this cultivation realm, regardless of using techniques or physical attacks, all seemed to be attacks of the Path of Heaven.

In other words, his body seemed to have become a part of the sky, and his true body’s power had also become the power of the Path of Heaven.

Unlike the fifth level, which used the power of heaven and earth, the core change of the sixth level was that people became a part of heaven and earth. The difference between the two was too vast.

“Dean, don’t worry about it for now. Those who are genuinely righteous will naturally be recognized in their actions and intentions. If Revered Qi wants to make a move, we’ll talk about it later. It’s only adding to our worries to think about it now.”

Qin Yu shook his head.

He had already sensed it. Somehow, a consciousness had locked onto him. That consciousness seemed to have locked onto him directly from the boundless void.

He could not break free at all. It was useless even if he used the second level of the desolate divine eye.

This should be Revered Qi’s method. Revered Qi would probably attack without hesitation if he made a slight move now.

“Yes, I hope the strength of Human Race Watch will make him somewhat apprehensive. Moreover, the higher-ups of the Gu family and I will also send a letter to the alliance, hoping to dispel his doubts.”

For now, this was the best they could do.

If Revered Qi wanted to kill Qin Yu at all costs, they could not stop him.

…

Excluding the Gu family, only seven were left in the alliance of the eight forces.

“How is it? I’ve already said that this kid is rebellious. This time, he joined forces with the Gu family to seize Teng Zixu’s Heavenly Profound Power. If Qin Yu and Teng Zixu had not joined forces, I don’t believe that Gu Ning would have left the Heart of the Ocean to him. There’s a high chance he has also inherited a portion of Teng Zixu’s Heavenly Profound Power.”

Hua Zhikong said with a cold smile. He looked around and saw that no one refuted him, he continued to speak.

“The most urgent thing now is to take him down while he’s still in our control. Otherwise, the human race will suffer heavy losses if he joins the demon race.”

His face showed no change in his expression, making people unable to guess what he was thinking.

Jiang Qingyuan said with a frown.

“Why did Qin Yu agree to enter the demon race to lure Teng Zixu over if she didn’t collude? This is obviously a trap to kill Teng Zixu. If not for her insufficient strength, the human race might have lost the Son of Cosmic Luck.”

Teng Tian, the head of the Teng family, was slightly trembling as if he was controlling his anger with all his might.

When he heard Jiang Qingyuan’s words, he immediately retorted coldly.

This time, the fact that Teng Zixu’s Heavenly Profound Power was snatched was a big blow to him and the entire Teng family.

At this moment, he wished he could eat Qin Yu’s flesh and devour his soul.

“If Qin Yu was really colluding with the demon race, why did he have to come back unnecessarily? He could have stayed in the depths of the Azure Rock Forest for a while. Who could touch him there? We human race really can’t fight among ourselves anymore.”

Jiang Qingyuan was silent for a long time before he spoke again.

“That’s because he still has many forces in Human Race Watch and is unwilling to part with them. Moreover, I don’t know if he’s plotting something more sophisticated. If we continue to hesitate and wait for this child to grow to a point where we can’t deal with him, it’ll be useless if we regret it then.”

Hua Zhikong sneered and said.

“Teng Zixu, what do you think? You’re the victim this time. I want to hear your opinion.”

Revered Qi suddenly asked.

“I don’t comment on a nameless person. Losing a portion of my Heavenly Profound Power might be good for me. In the past, I could easily break through by relying on Heavenly Profound Power. This time, I want to compare my human power with the heavens.”

Teng Zixu was expressionless. After he returned, he had been trying to comprehend the changes in his body.

The most direct impact was that his connection with the Path of Heaven seemed to have weakened.

After the Golden Path of Heaven descended, he advanced to the Tribulation Fifth level at a tremendous speed.

However, it seemed that there was more than just the comprehension of the power of the Path of Heaven above this cultivation realm.

Therefore, the loss of a wisp of the Heavenly Profound Power had allowed him to have a portion of his divine sense to comprehend the changes in his cultivation. It was also another kind of inspiration for him.

Moreover, he was also very confident that even if he, Teng Zixu, lost one-tenth of his Heavenly Profound Power, he would still be the chosen one.

“Great! As expected of the chosen one for Heavenly Profound Power of our human race! This is my comprehension between the fifth and sixth levels. Although everyone has a different path in this cultivation realm, it can also be used as a reference. It should be of some help to your future path. Furthermore, there’s also some information about the chosen one in each Path of Heaven year. It’s the supreme information collected by the Qi family’s previous family heads.”

Revered Qi walked down from the throne and gently tapped Teng Zixu’s forehead with his finger. Instantly, massive information entered Teng Zixu’s sea of consciousness.

“Thank you very much, Revered Qi.”

At this moment, Teng Zixu’s face revealed an excited expression.

Regardless of Revered Qi’s breakthrough comprehension or the information on the chosen one of the various Path of Heaven years, they were all unimaginable treasures to him.

The chosen ones were people with outstanding talents. Therefore, the path of cultivation that each of them had chosen must have been carefully considered.

From the cultivation paths of these people, he could refer to their successes and then extract the essence to eliminate the mistakes. This would definitely allow him to reduce many detours.

“Fixed cultivation path no longer exists above the Tribulation Fifth Level. Every step is filled with danger and struggling against the forces of nature. What you can achieve in the end depends on your luck.”

Revered Qi said softly. He looked into the sky and muttered.

“It seems it’s about time. Si Liuhe, I remember your Holy Son seems to have a hundred-year agreement with Qin Yu…”

…

On Huaning Mountain, Qin Yu was cultivating.

At this moment, Qin Yu was completely immersed in the Heart of the Ocean.

After Gu Ning’s death, Qin Yu’s soul directly refined this magical artifact. Gu Ning did not impose any restrictions on it.

He studied it for a long time, but he could only find that the recovery power of the Heart of the Ocean was tremendous.
