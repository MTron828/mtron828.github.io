2141 Heading to Astral Mountain

Rings of radiance, one after another, surrounded the hull, like layers of transparent protective shields.

Every ray of radiance seemed to contain boundless energy, filling the entire ancient ship with a strong sense of grandeur.

Meanwhile, the ancient ship also emitted a powerful internal qi making the air somewhat heavy.

Although the ancient ship looked simple and unadorned, every detail exuded incomparable magnificence and solemnity. It was as if the emperor’s ship that been through the sea of stars, displaying endless mystery.

“Quickly board the ship,” Qin Yu said to Yan Ruoxue.

However, at this moment, Qin Yu suddenly felt a powerful internal qi approaching from where they had just left.

“Someone is chasing after us!” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Yan Ruoxue’s expression slightly changed. She hurriedly shouted, “Quickly board the ship!”

However, at this moment, how would Qin Yu board the ship as requested by Yan Ruoxue?

He could clearly feel the strength of the comer. He was a genuine True Saint. It would be a disaster if he allowed him to follow them.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and turned to look at Yan Ruoxue. Then he squeezed out a bright smile and said, “Don’t worry. I’m here. You board the ship first.”

Yan Ruoxue frowned, unwilling to board the ship.

At this moment, an elderly man appeared in front of the two in an instant.

Seeing who he was, Qin Yu’s expression slightly changed.

“It’s you!” Qin Yu’s expression was ice-cold.

It was none other than the linen-robed elderly man of the Ni family!

With a hint of mockery on his aged countenance, the slight smile at the corner of his mouth revealed his inner smugness.

“Qin Yu, how dare you kidnap the Yan family’s saintess?” the linen-robed elderly man said with a faint smile.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “There’s no deep hatred between us. Why why do you persist in closely following me like this?”

“Hahaha!” The linen-robed elderly man Burst into hearty laughter.

“Qin Yu! I knew you had bad intentions, so I’ve been watching you secretly! As expected, you want to abduct the Yan family’s saintess!” the linen-robed elderly man shouted.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said, “What exactly do you want?!”

“After I bring you back, I think the Yan family and the Si family will remember me.”

Qin Yu was about to speak when Yan Ruoxue stepped forward.

She looked at the linen-robed elderly man in front of her, bowed, and greeted him, “Senior.”

“Saintess Yan,” the linen-robed elderly man responded. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Yan Ruoxue continued, “Senior, please make an exception. Just treat it as me owing you a favor. I’ll definitely repay you double in the future. I mean what I say.”

However, when the linen-robed elderly man heard this, he said with slight disdain, “Saintess Yan, if I let you go today, the Yan family will never let me go. If I take you back, the Yan family and the Ji family will owe me a big favor.”

Yan Ruoxue wanted to say something, but Qin Yu shook his head and said coldly, “You definitely can’t persuade this old b*stard. You board the ship, and I’ll come over later.”

“Qin Yu, you knew it. Why don’t you surrender?” the linen-robed elderly man laughed loudly and said.

“Senior, do you really want to do this? If I return to the Yan family, I will definitely use all means to kill you,” Yan Ruoxue said coldly.

However, the linen-robed elderly man was not afraid. With his hands behind his back, he smiled faintly and said, “I will apologize to Saintess Yan in the future.”

Qin Yu was no longer in the mood to waste his breath on the linen-robed elderly man. He took a deep breath and coldly said, “Old thing, since you’re courting death, don’t blame me for being rude!”

“Courting death?” The linen-robed elderly man seemed somewhat surprised.

“Qin Yu, I’m a True Saint and a True Saint of the rising star of the current era. Killing you is as easy as lifting a hand, and you dare to utter such defiant words? Are you crazy?”

“Although my cultivation realm is not comparable to yours, I’ve already expected today’s situation. Since I dare to do it, I’ve naturally made full preparations,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The linen-robed elderly man sneered. He put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “In front of true strength, all techniques are useless.”

Qin Yu did not say anything else. He closed his eyes slightly, and his breathing became deep and calm. Immediately after, he silently recited a forbidden technique in the Traceless Immortal Scripture, the Dao Slaying Technique.

The Dao Slaying Technique was ancient and mysterious. It represented an incredibly formidable power. It could forcefully increase a cultivator’s strength within a short time, allowing them to have the ability to fight against cultivators of a higher realm. However, it was also a double-edged sword. Once used, it would cause a tremendous loss to the cultivator’s life force.

When Qin Yu finished reciting the last word of this forbidden technique in his heart, his internal qi suddenly erupted. The surrounding air seemed to be under the control of his internal qi, creating a sense of stagnation.

His eyes flashed with a resolute gleam. He knew that if he could not defeat the elderly man, he and Yan Ruoxue would be brought back to the Yan family by the elderly man. Then he would face an unpredictable disaster.

Sensing the change in Qin Yu’s internal qi, a hint of surprise appeared in the linen-robed elderly man’s eyes and then the corners of his mouth curled into a sneer. Clearly, he did not take Qin Yu seriously.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s internal qi still kept rising. The surrounding void collapsed one after another. That incredible internal qi made people feel uneasy!

His entire body was enveloped in golden light, which continuously emitted a crackling sound as if thunderbolts were swirling around. It was incredibly frightening!

The linen-robed elderly man slightly narrowed his eyes as if he had a hint of shock at the increase in Qin Yu’s internal qi.

But he was not panicking because as long as Qin Yu did not step into True Saint Realm, he had no chance of winning!

“Ah!”

With Qin Yu’s roar, his internal qi reached its peak. Compared to an ordinary Semi-Saint, it had grown several times!

“You have some ability. It seems the benefits you’ve obtained from the Traceless Immortal Scripture are more terrifying than I’ve imagined,” the linen-robed elderly man said indifferently.

And then he changed the subject and said coldly, “But so what? As long as you’re not a True Saint, I’ll slaughter you like a chicken or a dog!”

“Is that so…” A hint of madness flashed across Qin Yu’s face. Then he raised his head and roared angrily, and the internal qi on his body soared again!

“The sixth level of the fighting word formula, open!”

At this moment, Qin Yu’s internal qi was so formidable that it made people tremble in fear. Compared to True Saint, he was just a hair’s breadth away!

The linen-robed elderly man’s expression was somewhat ugly. He did not seem to have expected Qin Yu to about to break through the boundary of this realm!
