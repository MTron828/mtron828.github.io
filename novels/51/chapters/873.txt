Chapter 874: In chapter 874, he would not be the first martial saint 

Qin Yu had heard of this kind of poison before.

Once one was infected with the aphrodisiac poison, one’s entire body would become hot and unbearable.

The method to remove this kind of poison was also extremely harsh. Other than having sex, there was almost no other way.

Once the aphrodisiac poison was not removed in time, it was highly likely that it would cause permanent damage to the body.

However, what puzzled Qin Yu was why she was infected with the aphrodisiac poison at this time? Who was the person who poisoned her?

“Strange.”Looking at Zhang Yi Jiu who was attached to her body, Qin Yu could not help but frown.

“Could it be that brother song and the others poisoned her?”

After thinking about it, this was the only possibility.

They might have poisoned Zhang Yi Jiu long ago, and it was only at this time that it exploded.

At this moment, Zhang Yi Jiu was about to tear his clothes to shreds.

Her jade-like fingers continuously caressed Qin Yu’s body.

Qin Yu was also a young man full of vigor. Facing such a temptation, even he found it difficult to endure.

“I’m so hot... Hurry up and save me...”

Zhang Yi Jiu moved his face in front of Qin Yu and opened his mouth to pounce on Qin Yu’s lips.

At this critical moment, Qin Yu pushed Zhang Yijiu away.

He suddenly dived into the snow to wake himself up from the biting cold snow.

A few minutes later, Qin Yu climbed out of the snow.

He looked at the pained Zhang Yijiu and shook his head. “I’m sorry, I really can’t do anything to let Ruoxue down...”

Even if a thought flashed through Qin Yu’s mind, he would feel that it was unfair to Yan Ruoxue.

“I’m So Hot... save me...”Zhang Yi Jiu begged bitterly. She reached out her hand and grabbed Qin Yu’s thigh.

Qin Yu took a deep breath. He raised his hand and slapped Zhang Yi Jiu’s back with a bang.

Zhang Yi Jiu immediately fainted and his consciousness dissipated.

However, her body was still affected by the poison.

Her originally fair skin now looked a little dark red.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I’m really sorry. If you can’t take it anymore, I can only kill you.”

If others heard this, they would definitely think that Qin Yu was heartless.

However, in this long process of cultivation, Qin Yu’s heart became harder and harder. Other than Yan Ruoxue, he could lose almost everything else.

Zhang Yijiu lay on the ground, and Qin Yu accompanied him.

After an unknown amount of time, Zhang Yijiu finally woke up. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The poison in her body had disappeared, but the moment she opened her eyes, she spat out a mouthful of blood, and she was extremely weak.

“You’re awake.”Qin Yu glanced at her and said indifferently.

Although Zhang Yijiu was poisoned by the aphrodisiac poison, she still remembered everything that happened before he fainted.

Therefore, she looked at Qin Yu with hatred.

“You would rather watch me die than help me? Am I Ugly?”Zhang Yi Jiu said angrily.

Qin Yu shook her head and said, “It has nothing to do with beauty or ugliness, but I’m not very interested in you.”

“You!”Zhang Yi Jiu pointed at Qin Yu and spat out another mouthful of blood. His face turned pale again.

It was obvious that this was the damage caused by the spring poison to her body.

“If you want to blame someone, you shouldn’t blame me. You should blame the person who poisoned you.”Qin Yu was like an emotionless machine.

Zhang Yi Jiu looked at Qin Yu fiercely and said, “Qin Yu, you are worse than a beast!”

Qin Yu spread his hands and said, “I will ask the pavilion master to help you remove the poison.”

Then, Qin Yu stood up from the ground and said, “Let’s go, take me away from here.”

Although Zhang Yi Jiu had some resentment toward Qin Yu, she still took Qin Yu away from this extremely cold place.

After arriving at the airport, the two of them bought plane tickets and prepared to return to Jingdu.

On the way, Qin Yu leaned back on the chair and closed her eyes to rest.

Zhang Yi Jiu couldn’t help but ask, “Are you not interested in me at all?”

“No,”Qin Yu replied without hesitation.

“You!”Zhang Yi Jiu was instantly furious.

For some reason, the more Qin Yu acted like this, the more unwilling she felt.

On the contrary, if Qin Yu coveted her body, she would feel disgusted instead.

Humans were just so cheap.

...

The plane flew high in the sky and soon returned to Jingdu.

Qin Yu’s trip only took three days. The day he arrived in Jingdu was coincidentally the New Year.

“You should go to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion First.”Qin Yu glanced at Zhang Yijiu.

“When you arrive at the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, use my name. The pavilion master will help you.”

Zhang Yijiu snorted lightly and said, “Stop pretending to be a good person.”

Qin Yu didn’t have time to waste with her. After giving her a few instructions, she headed straight for ye Qing’s home.

It was the New Year’s Eve, and the sound of firecrackers and fireworks could be heard from time to time.

On the other hand, the entrance of ye Qing’s house was deserted and dark.

Other than the SUV, there was almost nothing else. It was a stark contrast to the thick smell of New Year in the outside world.

When Qin Yu arrived, ye Qing was wearing a military coat and smoking in front of the window.

He looked out of the window, thinking about something.

“Why is Officer Ye spending the new year alone?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but ask.

Ye Qing glanced at Qin Yu, but he didn’t pay attention to his question. Instead, he said, “Why are you here?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I’m here to report my work to you.”

“Oh?”Ye Qing raised his eyebrows.

“Could it be that you’ve completed it in just three days?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “It’s almost impossible for three organizations. I don’t have that much time.”

Ye Qing narrowed his eyes and frowned, “So?”

Qin Yu took out his phone, opened the video, and handed it to Ye Qing.

“But the Han palace has already been destroyed,”Qin Yu said.

Looking at the content on the phone, ye Qing could not help but frown slightly.

“You mean... the palace master of the Han Palace is about to step into the Martial Saint Realm?”Ye Qing looked at the content of the video and frowned deeply.

“That’s right.”Qin Yu nodded.

“I stopped him before he stepped into the martial saint realm. Does this count as Meritorious Service?”

Ye Qing did not pay attention to these words. His brows were filled with worry.

“Someone is really about to step into the martial saint realm. This is not good news...”ye Qing muttered in a low voice.

Qin Yu sat down on ye Qing’s sofa and said with a smile, “Officer Ye, you should know better than me what will happen to anyone who possesses power that surpasses most people.”

Ye Qing glanced at Qin Yu and said, “What do you mean?”

“If he successfully becomes a martial saint, do you think you can still catch him?”Qin Yu said.

Ye Qing remained silent. Just as Qin Yu had said, once this palace master of the Han Palace stepped into the martial saint realm, no one would be able to restrain him.

“He won’t be the only one who becomes a martial saint.”Qin Yu continued.

“When that time comes, the martial saint of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association will also appear. I don’t think this is what you want to see.”

Ye Qing put his phone to the side. He took a puff of his cigarette and said, “What do you want to say?”

“I want to say that you should help me now. Let me become a martial saint as soon as possible to restrict them.”Qin Yu raised his eyebrows with great confidence.
