Chapter 1210: Chapter 1210, teleportation array flag! 

On the Back Mountain of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

This was originally a barren hill, but under Xiang Danqing’s hard work, it had turned into a green mountain and green water.

The moonlight hanging high in the sky was the only light here. The people in the distance seemed to have fallen asleep long ago.

Everything was silent.

Qin Yu sat on the mountain in a daze.

His mind was in a mess, and his heart was filled with mixed feelings.

Even though he had never met his mother, the blood flowing in his body, and even his constitution, were all inherited from his mother.

Qin Yu wanted to bring his mother’s divine sense back, but he didn’t know what to do.

The cold wind blew, and the medicinal herbs rustled. Qin Yu was enveloped by the plants, but there wasn’t a trace of life in his eyes.

He could not figure out why his father did not save his mother if the so-called lord could not even defeat Qin Yu.

“I was so close. I was so close to saving my mother’s life...”Qin Yu stood up from the ground. His long clothes fluttered like wings in the wind, but his eyes were already full of tears.

This feeling of being so close yet disappearing in the blink of an eye was the most painful.

Qin Yu did not walk down the mountain for the whole night.

He even thought of committing suicide and forcing his father to show himself.

But in the end, this thought was dispelled by him.

At any time, there was only hope to live.

Xiang Danqing had already guessed that Qin Yu was on the back mountain, but he did not disturb him. He just waited quietly in the courtyard.

Early in the morning, Qin Yu came down from the mountain.

He swept away the haze and looked extremely refreshed, as if nothing had happened.

“Qin Yu, you... I’m sorry for your loss.”Xiang Danqing struggled for a long time. He was not good with words, so in the end, he only said a few words.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I’m fine now. By the way, Senior Xiang, do you know a person called Lord in Triangle City?”

“Lord?”Qin Yu frowned, then shook his head and said, “I’ve never heard of him.”

“Okay, I got it.”Qin Yu didn’t stay any longer. He left after saying goodbye to Xiang Danqing.

Lord and even old Meng disappeared overnight.

Qin Yu searched almost the entire rainbow village, but he couldn’t find any trace of old Meng.

The only thing he found was that the ancient array platform seemed to have been moved by someone.

At that time, Qin Yu had been observing the array platform for a long time. All the details couldn’t escape Qin Yu’s eyes.

There seemed to be traces of human activity on the array platform.

Not only that, the eight withered flags in the surroundings had also been pulled out.

“Could it be that they left this place through this ancient array platform?”Qin Yu thought to himself.

That lord was probably not simple. According to Qin Yu’s simple investigation, this lord was actually the spiritual leader of triangle city.

In other words, he was like the faith of the entire triangle city. It was said that when their city Lord took over, he would be called someone who was arranged by the heavens, and that heavens referred to the lord.

Qin Yu came to this palace again.

There were many people in the palace, and they seemed to be discussing something.

Chief Bao was the master behind Triangle City. Now that Chief Bao had disappeared overnight, these people were planning a coup.

Qin Yu didn’t care about this, and he didn’t want to kill the innocent anymore. Therefore, he bypassed the crowd and came to the door where the Lord was.

That day, when Qin Yu came, it was pitch-black. Qin Yu didn’t have time to observe carefully.

When he barged in again today, he found that there was a huge black crystal in the camera lens of the long corridor. It blended with the darkness.

Behind the crystal stood a huge statue.

The statue was also pitch-black. Qin Yu didn’t know whether it was because of its huge size or other reasons, but he could feel a trace of majesty emanating from the statue.

Qin Yu walked around the crystal and walked to the front of the statue. He saw a faint light like a firefly flickering between the eyebrows of the statue.

“What is this?”Qin Yu frowned slightly.

He stretched out his hand and touched the light.

In an instant, a figure appeared in Qin Yu’s mind.

This person wore a crown and held a scepter. His two eyes were emitting two different colors, one black and one white.

His body was quite huge, but he was also extremely thin. The clothes he wore seemed to be imperial clothing.

In front of this person, there were many people who looked like ministers kneeling on the ground with respect. It was a heartfelt submission.

The scene flashed past and quickly disappeared without a trace.

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Could it be that the huge figure was the lord they were talking about?

From this scene, it seemed to be the scene of the ancient imperial family kneeling.

Could it be that this lord was one of the Kings of triangle city and had used some kind of secret technique to live until today?

Just as Qin Yu was deep in thought, he suddenly noticed that on one side of the stone chair, there was a black leather box.

The box was locked and sealed with a secret technique.

However, this secret technique was not difficult for Qin Yu. He violently tore open the black leather box.

Inside the black leather box, there were three flags.

There were extremely strange characters carved on the flags. These characters did not seem to come from Earth.

Qin Yu picked up the three flags and examined them carefully. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“These flags seem familiar...”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

“HMM?”Soon, Qin Yu realized that something was wrong!

Wasn’t this flag the flag needed to activate the ancient array platform? Why would it appear here?

Could it be that the Lord had stored the spatial array flags needed to traverse the void?

If that was the case, Qin Yu would be able to head to the saint realm by himself. There was no need for him to rely on them to extradite him!

Thinking of this, Qin Yu hurriedly scouted his surroundings, wanting to see if there were any similar array flags.
