1756 The Power of Faith

Yuan Xiu seemed to be extremely curious. After all, no one had ever crossed the dead river before.

“I’m guessing you have some sort of magical artifact on you.” Yuan Xiu said indifferently.

Xiao Hai looked at Yuan Xiu coldly and said, “None of them are correct.”

“Oh? Then what did you rely on?” Yuan Xiu continued to ask.

“It’s because of faith,” Xiao Hai said coldly. “It’s because of strong faith. Of course, people like you will never understand.”

“Faith?” Yuan Xiu was stunned for a moment before he burst out laughing. “What is faith? Can it be eaten? You can accomplish what you can’t just by relying on your faith?”

“Yes.” Xiao Hai nodded.

At this moment, everyone was greatly shocked!

Qin Yu, who was not far away, could not help but clench his fists.

He believed in the power of faith. As long as he had strong faith in his heart, that would be his dao!

This kind of belief could only be realized by Xiao Hai!

Under the urging of this belief, he relied on his ordinary constitution to forcefully cross the dead river and almost killed those Four Godly Kings!

“This guy is really abnormal!” Sima Bei could not help but curse in his heart.

Yong Ji, on the other hand, kept silent.

At this moment, he suddenly realized that the gap between him and Xiao Hai was too big. It was like the difference between heaven and earth. There was no way to compare.

In other words, no one in the entire Nanzhou could be compared to Xiao Hai.

“You’re really worthy of respect.” Yuan Xiu said sincerely.

“I’ve lived for so many years, and you’re the only person I admire.”

Even Yuan Xiu felt a sense of respect for Xiao Hai.

How terrifying would such a person be in the future? No one knew.

Perhaps, no other body in this world could compare to the power brought by his strong faith.

“It’s a pity, I really don’t want to kill you,” Yuan Xiu shook his head.

“If it’s possible, I hope you can leave now.”

“You know I won’t do that,” Xiao Hai shook his head.

“It’s a pity. All this while, I’ve been somewhat afraid of your brother, Xiao Sheng. But now, I’ve realized that you’re even scarier than him.”

“You’re too pure. you’re as pure as a pool of clear water. I can’t even bear to pollute it.”

Indeed, even Yuan Xiu had said such words, let alone others.

“Xiao Hai is a freak. He is indeed a legend in Nanzhou.” Wen Wanchong muttered.

Although Qu Zhu didn’t say anything, he had the same thought in his heart.

Qin Yu was the only one who stared at Xiao Hai with a complicated expression.

It was no exaggeration to say that Qin Yu was moved by his temperament!

That strong faith was enough to support him to complete anything!

“Then why didn’t you die?” Yuan Xiu continued to ask.

“I’m the same as you,” Xiao Hai said coldly.

“The same as me?” Yuan Xiu asked, stunned. “What do you mean by that?”

“The moment I stepped into the North Plain, I sensed the dao techniques of the North Plain, or rather, the dao techniques of the Immortal Slaying Sect.” Xiao Hai said in a deep voice.

Upon hearing this, Yuan Xiu’s expression turned extremely ugly!

He stared at Xiao Hai and said, “Could it be that you’ve also received the inheritance of the Immortal Slaying Sect?”

“No, I only sensed a trace of dao technique, and I comprehended a bit of it.” Xiao Hai said.

“Of course, I’m not as scary as you. You can recover in a flash. I spent a long time, but I survived by luck.”

At this moment, Yuan Xiu’s face was extremely ugly. He even looked a little desperate!

Xiao Hai could actually sense the dao technique the moment he stepped into the North Plain! How terrifying was this?

One had to know that Yuan Xiu had spent hundreds of years to comprehend a trace of the Immortal Slaying Sect’s inheritance after receiving it!

“You’re really too terrifying.” Yuan Xiu took a deep breath.

“I don’t think it’s an injustice to die in the hands of someone like you,” Yuan Xiu had even said something so shocking! Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Xiao Hai’s body slowly emitted his internal qi.

This internal qi was incomparably thick, as big as the world!

It was as if a golden dragon was coiling around his body, and his body was like a tall mountain!

“Xiao Hai, are you really going to attack? I can’t bear to kill you.” Yuan Xiu said coldly.

“I didn’t expect that even someone like you would have compassion.” Xiao Hai said coldly.

“No, you’re wrong. This isn’t compassion. I’m just cherishing talents.” Yuan Xiu smiled and shook his head.

“What is talent?” Xiao Hai asked.

“In your eyes, those who have the talent for cultivation are talents and are worth cherishing. As for those who have weak talent in cultivation, can you ignore them?”

“That’s right. Those without talent in cultivation are worthless. No one will value them.” Yuan Xiu nodded his head slightly.

“Why do you use talent to judge a person’s value?” Xiao Hai sighed.

“I’ve always thought that everyone should live equally. At least they have the right to live.

“Most people in this world are ordinary people.”

“Xiao Hai, you’re too indecisive,” Yuan Xiu said, shaking his head.

“Maybe.” Xiao Hai sighed.

The internal qi on his body was still exploding.

After sensing Xiao Hai’s internal qi, Yuan Xiu sighed. “You really want to attack me? You’re only a half-step Reversion Void Stage cultivator, you’re no match for me. It would be a pity if you die in battle today.”

“I’m no different from those who were killed. If you don’t feel pity for them, you don’t have to feel pity for me either.” Xiao Hai said.

“Moreover, I might not die today.”

Yuan Xiu could not help but sneer.

“Do you really think you can defeat me as a Reversion Void Stage cultivator?” Yuan Xiu said coldly.

“I can’t, but I think I can hold you back until Xiao Sheng comes out.” Xiao Hai said.

“If that’s the case, then don’t blame me for being impolite!” Yuan Xiu laughed.

“Xiao Hai, I admit that you’re a genius, but it’s a pity that geniuses often die young!”

Yuan Xiu shouted as he charged at Xiao Hai.

His palm contained a terrifying power. Black light wrapped around his arm as if he was borrowing some terrifying ancient power!

Xiao Hai’s face was cold. He suddenly raised his thick arms and pressed his broad body forward.

The rough palm was facing Yuan Xiu!

“Not good, he’s going to meet force with force!” Wen Wanchong’s eyes widened, and he looked extremely nervous!

Qu Zhu also frowned. He knew how terrifying Xiao Hai was, but he was only at the half-step Reversion Void Stage. How could he fight against Yuan Xiu who was in such a terrifying realm?

“Boom!”

At the moment of collision, the already dilapidated Divine Capital City was completely shattered!
