1781 Devour the Primordial Spirit

“You guys also know about Yuan Xiu?” Qin Yu frowned and said.

“Yuan Xiu has been in North Plain for so many years. Who doesn’t know about him?” Xiaobai shook his head.

“Moreover, no one in the entire Lizhou can escape from the eyes of Thunder Courtyard.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Qin Yu thought for a while and felt that it made sense.

!!

After all, Yuan Xiu was the ruler of the North Plain and had lived for so many years. His reputation was probably far above that of Xiao Sheng and the others.

“Alright. Thank you,” Qin Yu bowed to Xiaobai and said.

Qin Yu didn’t want to cause any trouble in Thunder Courtyard. He just wanted his primordial spirit to recover as soon as possible.

When he returned to his place, Jue Wu was already fast asleep on the ground.

Qin Yu found a place to sit down. He didn’t feel sleepy at all. Instead, he sat on the ground and tried to get used to the pain.

In the following few days.

Qin Yu and Jue Wu didn’t leave this grotto-heaven.

In this place, Jue Wu was like a hunter. She went into the forest all day long and brought back wild animals from time to time.

Qin Yu could also be considered to have benefited from being together with Jue Wu. They ate and drank every day. They were quite happy.

In the blink of an eye, it was the third day.

The next day was the day to leave for the East Continent.

On this day, while Qin Yu and Jue Wu were gnawing on the thigh of an unknown beast, someone suddenly came in.

The person who came in was a burly man. He sniffed and said, ” It smells so good!”

Jue Wu wasn’t so cautious. She tore off a piece of meat and threw it at the burly man.

“You feel like eating? I’ll give you a piece if you want.” Jue Wu muttered as she stuffed the meat into her mouth.

The burly man grabbed the piece of meat, sneered, and suddenly crushed it!

Seeing this scene, Jue Wu’s eyes suddenly opened wide.

“D*mn it! If you didn’t want to eat, you should have said so earlier!” Jue Wu said angrily.

The burly man didn’t care about Jue Wu, but his gaze fell on Qin Yu.

Qin Yu knew that this person was not friendly. So he stood up immediately.

“I heard that you defeated Yuan Xiu in your Mighty Realm,” said the burly man.

“I was just lucky,” Qin Yu said.

The burly man raised his eyebrows, smiled faintly, and said, “Everyone who can come here is heaven’s favorite. You don’t have to belittle yourself.”

“Go straight to the point,” Qin Yu said.

The burly man crossed his arms, smiled, and said. “I’m not talented, but I’m quite famous in Demon-slaying Peak. I’ve always liked to fight. I’ve challenged everyone in Demon-slaying Peak.”

“So you want to fight me?” Qin Yu asked in a cold voice.

“That’s right,” the burly man bowed slightly, smiled, and said.

“F*ck you! You know that Qin Yu’s primordial spirit is damaged. Are you trying to take advantage of him?” Jue Wu said angrily.

The burly man waved his hand and said, “No! No! No! I don’t bully people. It’s up to Qin Yu to decide whether he agrees or not.”

“Oh! Then I disagree.” Qin Yu rejected the burly man without thinking.

The burly man was also stunned. He scratched his head as if he did not expect Qin Yu to reject so directly.

“Did you hear that? Qin Yu has already rejected it. So get out of here,” Jue Wu said.

The burly man looked at Qin Yu up and down and said, “Qin Yu, I can give you time. But if you just reject directly… Aren’t you too gutless?”

“You’re the one who is gutless!” Before Qin Yu could finish, Jue Wu whooshed over.

She stood in front of the burly man, raised her head, and said, “Didn’t you say that you’ve challenged everyone in Demon-slaying Peak? when are you going to challenge me? I’ll accompany you.”

The burly man looked down at Jue Wu, laughed, and said, “I don’t want to fight with you. Do you think I don’t know your notorious reputation in Nanzhou?”

“You’re the one who’s f*cking notorious!” Jue Wu’s eyes were wide open, and her chest heaved up and down due to anger.

The burly man did not care about Jue Wu. He looked at Qin Yu and shouted, “Qin Yu, if there’s a chance, you and I must fight.”

After saying this, the burly man turned around and walked out without looking back.

When he reached the door, the burly man laughed and said, “Qin Yu, if you reject me, the entire Demon-slaying Peak will look down on you.”

Qin Yu was too lazy to respond to him. He didn’t care what other people thought.

After the man left, Jue Wu couldn’t help but curse, “D*mn it! This b*stard is too arrogant. I really want to beat him up!”

“Ignore him,” Qin Yu waved his hand and said. “Let’s eat.”

Jue Wu angrily grabbed a piece of meat and started to gnaw.

On the following day.

Qin Yu and Jue Wu were ready to leave for the East Continent.

It was Qin Yu’s first time going to the East Continent. Thus he was quite curious about it.

He summoned the Divine Eagle and rode on the huge Divine Eagle, heading straight for the East Continent.

On the way, Qin Yu tried to mobilize the spiritual power in his body again. This time, it seemed to have improved a little, and his endurance level had obviously increased.

According to Qin Yu’s estimation, he could only exert 20% of his strength at this time.

When Qin Yu tried to take a step further, the pain came back again, almost causing him to faint.

“Phew!” Qin Yu wiped away the sweat from his forehead and let out a long sigh.

Seeing this, Jue Wu quickly said, “You just stay here and leave the rest to me.”

“Alright,” Qin Yu nodded and said.

After spending a few days, the two of them finally arrived at the East Continent.

The East Continent and Nanzhou were the two most prosperous places.

At a glance, this place was even more prosperous than Nanzhou.

Qin Yu took out Ji Si’s location and gave it to Jue Wu.

Jue Wu glanced at it and said, “Don’t waste time. Let’s go now.”

“Mmm.” Qin Yu nodded. They put away the Divine Eagle and hurried toward Ji Si’s place on foot.

On the way, Qin Yu quietly sized up the cultivators of the East Continent.

These cultivators were extremely powerful. On this journey alone, Qin Yu detected many Reversion Void Stage cultivators.

“It seems that many people took the opportunity to reach the Reversion Void Stage after Great Upheaval,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

The sounds of people selling things could be heard everywhere, and all kinds of treasures were displayed by the roadside.

Qin Yu activated his desolate divine eye and scanned through the items roughly. As expected, most of the so-called treasures were fake and not worth mentioning.

Obviously, it was not that easy to find the treasure.

Another two days passed.

Finally, Qin Yu and Jue Wu arrived near Ji Si’s residence.

This place was bustling and was surrounded by people. There were restaurants and inns nearby. Thus the traffic was extremely high.

“Try not to make a move in this kind of place,” Qin Yu said to Jue Wu.

Jue Wu sneered and said, “Who cares! Let’s kill him first.”

“Of course, it’s fine for you to kill. But I can’t let anyone see me devouring primordial spirit,” Qin Yu frowned and said.

“That’s simple.” Jue Wu coldly snorted.

She raised her small hand and gently pinched the space in front of her. The space was immediately distorted.

Following that, the surrounding space began to change. In the blink of an eye, Jue Wu seemed to have completely isolated the surrounding space.
