When they heard this, everyone turned around and looked over.

This man was none other than the principal of the school.

The principal panted heavily and quickly ran over.

“Principal, you... why are you here?” Director Wang said with some surprise.

The principal glared at Director Wang and said coldly, “Because of your position in the school, you abused your power to do whatever you want. I now announce that you are fired!”

When he heard this, Director Wang’s expression turned extremely ugly!

This school was one of the top aristocratic schools in Chuzhou. With his position, there was no telling how much money he had earned!

Most importantly, Director Wang thought that this was a stable job, so he took out a loan to buy a lot of luxury goods.

If he was fired now, he would probably be heavily in debt!

“Principal, I... I know now. Don’t fire me...” Director Wang said with a panicked expression.

The principal ignored him. His gaze fell on Qin Yu, and then he said with an embarrassed smile, “You are Mr. Qin Yu?”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said with a cold expression, “It seems that your school doesn’t live up to its reputation.”

The principal’s expression changed, and he hurriedly said, “Mr. Qin, this is definitely an exception! I promise there won’t be a next time!”

Qin Yu sneered again and again.

He glanced at Mrs. Zhang, who wasn’t far away, and said, “This kind of person is qualified to teach and educate people? She can’t even be fair and just when facing a group of primary school children. Can she teach students properly?”

Mrs. Zhang’s face instantly turned pale!

At this moment, she realized that this young man in front of her had much more power than Director Wang!

“Mr. Qin, I. . . I didn’t know my place. Don’t worry, from now on, I will take special care of Yao Man...” Mrs. Zhang hurriedly said.

Qin Yu sneered. “It seems that you don’t understand what I’m saying.”

“It’s because of teachers like you that there is a bad social climate.”

“You’d better scram quickly.”

Mrs. Zhang wanted to say something, but the principal scolded, “Hurry up and scram? You’re a disgrace!”

With one sentence, he fired Director Wang and Mrs. Zhang.

Although the two of them were unwilling, they couldn’t do anything about it.

After chasing them away, Qin Yu looked at the principal.

“Principal, you have to pay attention to the school’s social climate in the future,” Qin Yu said with a dark expression.

The principal wiped his sweat and nodded. “Yes, yes, definitely...”

Then, Qin Yu ignored the principal. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He bent down to look at Yao Man and said with a smile, “Let’s go. I will bring you to eat. What do you want to eat?”

“I want to eat hotpot!” Yao Man said excitedly.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Okay, let’s eat hotpot!”

Qin Yu deliberately didn’t let Yao Qing drive, but let him accompany Yao Man in the back seat.

The car sped all the way to the largest hotpot restaurant in the city.

“Order whatever you want to eat.” Qin Yu handed the menu to Yao Man.

Yao Man seemed to be a bit restrained. Obviously, her temper was a bit introverted.

“It’s okay. Mr. Qin has a lot of money. Order whatever you want to eat,” Yao Qing said with a smile.

Yao Man nodded. After hearing Yao Qing’s words, she was also a lot more relaxed.

After ordering, Yao Man asked carefully, “Mr. Qin, are you my brother’s new boss?”

Boss?

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and couldn’t help but laugh.

He reached out to touch Yao Man’s head and said, “No, your brother and I are friends.”

“Wow, really?!” Yao Man suddenly looked pleasantly surprised.

“Of course, if you don’t believe me, ask your brother,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

Yao Qing couldn’t help but feel a little awkward. He looked at Qin Yu with a grateful gaze.

Soon, all kinds of ingredients were served.

Qin Yu also liked hot pot, so there were barely any leftovers on the table.

After dinner, Qin Yu sent Yao Man back to school.

“If there’s anything, just tell your brother. Don’t be afraid,” Qin Yu reminded before he left.

Yao Man nodded hard and said, “Thank you, Qin Yu!”

After sending Yao Man off, Qin Yu and Yao Qing left the school by car.

They returned to the hotel.

Qin Yu took out the document from the Jiang family and read it carefully.

Qin Yu’s current memory was beyond imagination. He flipped through it and memorized all the places.

“Mr. Qin, I really didn’t expect you to reach this stage.”

At night, Yao Qing laid in bed and couldn’t help but sigh.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “This is nothing. There is always someone better than you.”

If Qin Yu was satisfied with his current achievements, he would never be able to enter Jingdu and compete with the aristocratic families in Jingdu.

Qin Yu was barely able to deal with the Jiang family.

In front of the aristocratic families in Jingdu, the Jiang family was insignificant.

This was the difference.

“Go to sleep. We’ll return to Jiangcheng tomorrow,” said Qin Yu.

Jiangcheng was relatively more peaceful. During this period of time, many people were injured because of Qin Yu, so Qin Yu had to take responsibility for them.

The next morning, after Qin Yu woke up, he drove to Jiangcheng with Yao Qing.

A few hours later, the car entered Jiangcheng’s territory.

“Mr. Qin, do you want to go straight home?” Yao Qing asked.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “Let’s go to the factory first. I have something to talk to Mr. Yang about.”

“Okay,” Yao Qing answered.

Then, the car sped in the direction of the factory.

Everything was the same in the factory. The warehouse was still full of herbs.

However, when Qin Yu entered the factory, many workers looked at Qin Yu quizzically.

Some were frightened, some were excited, and some were surprised.

“What’s going on?” Qin Yu, not quite understanding, scratched his head.

“I don’t know. I also think it’s strange,” Yao Qing muttered.

He stopped a worker and said, “Is Mr. Yang in the office?”

The worker was so scared that his face turned pale. His lips trembled as he said, “I. . . I don’t know...”

After saying this, he ran away.

“How weird,” Qin Yu muttered.

The two of them walked toward Mr. Yang’s office.

Just as they reached the office door, Qin Yu saw four big men standing at the door.

Qin Yu looked at them closely. These four people seemed familiar.

“Lei Hu’s people?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh.

“It seems that Lei Hu is quite careful. He actually sent people to protect Mr. Yang in advance.”

However, the four of them looked at Qin Yu as if they were looking at a ghost!

“You better behave yourself, or else we’ll kill you!” At this moment, a wave of curses suddenly came from the office.

“Let me tell you, Qin Yu is already dead. Now, it’s Chief Xiong who has the final say!”

“Behave yourself and work for Chief Xiong. Chief Xiong might let you live. Otherwise... be careful your entire family suffers!”

When he heard this, Qin Yu’s expression instantly turned cold.

He hurriedly walked forward and pushed open the office door.

He saw that in the office, there were two strong men glaring at Mr. Yang.

And Mr. Yang was hiding in a corner while shivering. There were obvious wounds on his body.
