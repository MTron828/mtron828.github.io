Chapter 1548: Chapter 1,548, Beast Spirit Pill 1

Hearing Xia Ze’s words, everyone couldn’t help but gasp!

A physical body at the reversion void stage? Or a divine body?

One had to know that the divine body was one of the most powerful physiques at the moment. After stepping into such a divine body, who knew how powerful the physical body was!

But why would a divine body at the reversion void stage die in the Green Rock Forest?

What exactly was in the depths of the Green Rock Forest? Even a divine body would die after entering?

Qin Yu’s eyes were fixed on the corpse.

He activated the desolate divine eye and carefully examined it.

What surprised Qin Yu was that this body did not have any external injuries and seemed to be in perfect condition.

But if there were no external injuries, how did it die?

“Could it be... that the primordial spirit was wiped out?”Qin Yu suddenly thought of a possibility!

He could not help but suck in a cold breath. One had to know that the body of a divine body was not inferior to a chaotic body, not to mention that this was a person at the reversion void stage.

Such a body was very difficult to destroy, so the possibility of the primordial spirit being wiped out was extremely high.

Qin Yu did not say anything. This could not help but remind him.

......

Perhaps other than a powerful body, it was necessary to raise the primordial spirit.

“The starting price for this body is 200 million spirit coins, and each increment must be no less than 50 million,”Xia ze said at this time.

Hearing this, everyone present fell silent.

A divine body at the reversion void stage was important, but this price was a bit too expensive.

“It’s a good choice to give this body to iron egg,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu immediately raised his hand.

“Okay, this gentleman offers 200 million. Is there anyone who can offer a higher price?”Xia Ze asked.

“250 million,”someone not far away said.

Without thinking, Qin Yu raised his hand. “300 million spirit coins.”

“350 million.”

“400 million.”

“450 million.”

“...”

Soon, the price reached 600 million.

Qin Yu had promised to find a body for iron egg, so Qin Yu was determined to get this divine body.

Without thinking, he directly raised the price to 700 million.

The money was not his anyway, so it was very convenient to spend it.

After the price reached 700 million, the crowd seemed to fall into silence.

Such a high price was definitely an astronomical figure for an itinerant cultivator.

Xia Ze swept his gaze across the crowd. After she shouted three times, this divine body ultimately belonged to Qin Yu.

“This body, is it for me...”

At this moment, the voice of Heavenly Blood Rainbow suddenly came from Qin Yu’s spatial magic artifact.

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “You think too much. You have done many evil things. It’s already not bad that I can let you live, but you still want a divine body?”

Heavenly Blood Rainbow said with some displeasure, “Qin Yu, you promised me back then that as long as I cooperate with you, you would find a body for me.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I did promise you, but I didn’t say when I would fulfill it.”

“You!”Heavenly Blood Rainbow was furious, but he couldn’t do anything to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu still needed heavenly blood rainbow, so he softened his tone and said, “Alright, this body is a gift from me to my friend. Don’t worry, if there is a suitable opportunity, I will find you a body.”

At this time, Xia Ze had already taken out the second magical artifact.

This was a magical artifact. Although this magical artifact was not a void-level artifact, it was an Earth rank magical artifact.

Even void-level artifacts were divided into different levels. For example, Zhuo Jing’s Silver Spring was an earth rank void-level artifact. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

And the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s heavenly essence bell was a low-level heaven rank magical artifact.

This magical artifact was finally sold for 130 million spirit coins.

After buying this divine body, Qin Yu only had less than 200 million spirit coins left. Therefore, unless it was an extremely tempting treasure, Qin Yu would definitely not sell it.

The third auction item was also a magical artifact, and the price was 230 million.

The fourth was a heaven-rank cultivation technique, and the price was as high as 500 million.

The fifth, the sixth...

In the blink of an eye, nine treasures had already been successfully auctioned off.

Qin Yu was quite moved by these nine treasures, but he could only watch helplessly as the treasures were taken away by others.

“No wonder so many people choose to kill and steal. I have to say, these treasures are indeed too tempting,”Qin Yu said with a sigh.

This also made Qin Yu Sigh. Perhaps it was time to find an opportunity to earn some money.

Even in the cultivation world, money was needed to support it.

“The next item up for auction is a pill formula called the Beast Spirit Pill,”Xia ze said slowly.

Hearing this name, Qin Yu couldn’t help but narrow his eyes.

Beast Spirit Pill? What was that?

After this auction, Qin Yu seemed to have noticed something.

Throughout the entire auction, not a single item was related to a demonic beast.

This didn’t make sense. One had to know that the depths of the Green Rock Forest was the territory of Demonic Beasts. Normally, the most common treasures there were the flesh and bones of demonic beasts.

However, the entire auction was filled with cultivation techniques and magical artifacts. Not a single one of them was related to demonic beasts.

Combined with the tall figures of Xia Ze and the others, Qin Yu couldn’t help but suspect that this tribe in the depths of the green rock forest was related to demonic beasts.

“The Spirit Beast Pill is a special kind of pill. Consuming this pill can increase one’s physical body and strength. In other words, after consuming the Spirit Beast Pill, one will temporarily possess the physique of a demonic beast,”Xia ze said slowly.

When these words were spoken, the entire scene was instantly filled with shock!

This type of medicinal pill was definitely a top-notch killing weapon in a big battle!

Especially in a big battle like this with the northern lands. If all the participating cultivators were to consume the Beast Spirit Pill, the consequences would definitely exceed one’s imagination!

“This is the pill formula for the Beast Spirit Pill. If sold to a pharmacist, it will definitely be sold for an extremely high price!”

“That’s right, this pill formula is indeed tempting!”

“I don’t think any sect can reject this beast spirit Pill’s pill formula!”

It wasn’t just them. Qin Yu was also extremely tempted.

Right now was the crucial moment of the war with the northern lands. If he could obtain this pill formula, it would definitely have an extremely great effect.

“Unfortunately, the money in my hands is too little...”Qin Yu frowned tightly.

However, Qin Yu really wanted to obtain this pill formula.

“Hu... Don’t tell me you want me to be a person who kills people and steals their goods?”Qin Yu muttered softly.

With Qin Yu’s ability, killing people and stealing their goods was definitely not a difficult matter. However, it was really difficult for him to accept it in his heart.

“The starting bid for the Beast Spirit Pill formula is 300 million spirit coins,”Xia ze said.

Hearing this number, Qin Yu’s head immediately became even more troubled.

He only had less than 200 million in his hand, and the starting price had exceeded Qin Yu’s expectations.

Damn it, it’s really closing in on me. I can only be a villain for once! Qin Yu thought to himself.

“400 million!”

“500 million!”

“600 million!”

The price was too high, and many rogue cultivators from the major sects and sects began to make their bids.

Because they knew that the major sects absolutely liked this pill formula.
