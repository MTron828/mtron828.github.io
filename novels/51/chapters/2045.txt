Chapter 2046: The Chaos Grave Spread

Seeing the surging battle intent on Xiao Hai, Qin Yu was infected.

He stepped forward and said, “Come! Let’s fight!”

The earth-shattering roars by the two made everyone feel a sense of suffocation.

Si Liuhe sneered. He put his hands behind his back and said calmly, “I only used a third of my strength just now. Do you still want to continue?”

The moment he said this, everyone was instantly even more shocked!

Just a third of his strength was already so terrifying. Wouldn’t it destroy the world if he used his full strength?

“Xiao Hai, I can give you another chance,” Ji Liuhe said indifferently.

“I don’t think it’s necessary. I, Xiao Hai, will never go back on my word!” Xiao Hai laughed heartily and said.

“Alright, don’t blame me for being rude then!” Si Liuhe’s internal qi was surging, and it was terrifying!

Numerous people began to feel scared under this pressure. Their bodies trembled, and some even knelt on the ground, their knees shattering!

It was Si Liuhe’s terrifying internal qi. No one knew what cultivation realm he was at!

“Could it be that Si Liuhe has reached the True Saint realm?” someone gasped.

“It’s only higher, not lower,” someone said coldly.

Qin Yu glared at Si Liuhe, ready to fight to the death.

Beside him, the man with the mustache was pinching his fingers. No one knew what he was calculating.

“Go to hell!”

At this moment, Si Liuhe shouted and flipped his palm over!

However, the expected terrifying internal qi did not appear. Instead, it was silent, and there was no internal qi!

“Hmm?”

Everyone was stunned.

Si Liuhe was also stunned. He frowned and tried to feel the internal qi in his body but found it completely suppressed!

“It’s here,” the man with the mustache took a deep breath and sat on the ground, looking as if he had just survived a disaster.

“Hahaha! You’re fated not to die!” The man with the mustache laughed crazily!

“The Chaos Grave is spreading in such a way. Hahaha!”

The entire world was filled with the crazy laughter of the man with the mustache! Before they could feel suspicious, the surroundings were full of cries in shock!

“What happened? The internal qi in my body… Why is it suppressed?”

“Oh no! I can’t use my spiritual power at all!”

“What the hell is going on!”

Si Liuhe’s face darkened as well. He looked in the direction of the Chaos Grave and said in a low voice, “The internal qi in my body… is suppressed by the chaotic qi!”

Not only Si Liuhe but everyone else was suppressed by the chaotic qi and could not use their spiritual power!

“Being suppressed…” Qin Yu murmured. He was too familiar with this feeling!

At this moment, Qin Yu seemed to have thought of something.

“Spiritual power being suppressed… In other words, I can only rely on my physical body!” Qin Yu exclaimed in shock.

If it was a battle of the physical body, Qin Yu was not afraid!

The inherent advantage of the chaotic body allowed him not to be at a disadvantage even when facing a True Saint!

“The Chaos Grave has really spread.” Saintess Gu was slightly surprised.

She looked in the direction of the man with the mustache as if guessing something.

“An extraordinary expert,” Yao Xi muttered.

Si Liuhe frowned. He looked at Qin Yu and said coldly, “Your luck is quite good.”

Qin Yu laughed heartily and said, “Si Liuhe, I didn’t expect the spiritual power to be suppressed by the Chaos Grave. Hahaha! I’m afraid you won’t be able to kill me today!”

“Do you think I can’t kill you without spiritual power?” Si Liuhe’s face was cold.

Qin Yu stepped forward and shouted, “Come and try it out. I want to see if you’re at the True Saint cultivation realm!”

“You’re courting death!” Si Liuhe was enraged by Qin Yu. He took a step forward and punched Qin Yu fiercely!

Qin Yu naturally wasn’t afraid. He clenched his fist and used his strong body to meet the attack!

“Clang!”

The sound of metal clashing against metal instantly spread out, almost shattering everyone’s eardrums!

The two took three steps back at the same time, and Si Liuhe’s fist was in pain!

“Hahaha!”

Seeing this, Qin Yu immediately burst out laughing crazily!

“Si Liuhe, is this the body of a True Saint? It seems that it’s nothing special!” Qin Yu couldn’t stop laughing!

“Si Liuhe hasn’t reached the True Saint cultivation realm yet,” the man with the mustache said at this moment.

Qin Yu was stunned. He frowned and said, “It’s impossible, isn’t it? Since he could sweep across in all directions, how could he not even reach the True Saint cultivation realm?”

“Before the arrival of the Golden Age, no matter how talented you are, you can forget about stepping into the True Saint realm,” the man with the mustache sneered and said.

...

“Of course, geniuses like Si Liuhe and Yan Guyun wouldn’t waste their time. Even if they haven’t reached the True Saint cultivation realm, they can still comprehend the Holy Power in a different way. That’s why they have entered a very unique cultivation realm.”

“Although this cultivation realm is slightly different from the True Saint, the difference in strength isn’t big.”

Qin Yu suddenly realized Si Liuhe and Yan Guyun’s bodies had not become saints yet! There was nothing to fear then!

“Si Liuhe, you won’t be able to kill me!” Qin Yu shouted.

Si Liuhe was about to speak when Si Shiyue stepped forward. His hair flowed wildly, and he was filled with a fighting spirit like a god of war.

“Qin Yu, don’t be arrogant. My master doesn’t even need to do anything to kill you!” Ji Shiyue shouted.

Qin Yu looked at Si Shiyue coldly and said, “You came at the right time. I’ve wanted to see for myself the ability of a Holy Son like you.”

“Si Shiyue, your cultivation realm is higher than Qin Yu’s, so your body is naturally stronger than Qin Yu. There’s no need to compete,” Jiang He shook his head and said.

Si Shiyue glanced at Jiang He and said, “What does it have to do with you? I’m going to kill this Qin Yu today!”

“Wouldn’t people laugh at this?” Jiang He shook his head.

“Moreover, no one knows what kind of danger there is in the Chaos Grave. It’s better to leave for now.”

...

“After all…The Chaos Grave is more important.”

After hearing Jiang He’s words, everyone began to worry.

That’s right, the Chaos Grave had already started to spread. Who knew if the terrifying living being would rush out?

Not to mention the people of the nine great aristocratic families, even the few Formation Masters also wanted to leave as soon as possible.

Seeing that they were about to incur the wrath of the crowd, Si Liuhe and the others could not continue to stop them.

Moreover, if Si Shiyue, with a higher cultivation realm, lost to Qin Yu’s physical body, he would probably never recover.

Si Liuhe glanced at Qin Yu and said coldly, “Qin Yu, don’t forget that after we leave this Chaos

Grave, our spiritual power will recover. At that time, you won’t be able to escape death either.” “F*ck you! At most, I won’t leave,” Qin Yu said, laughing.

“But… If I don’t leave, can you guys sleep? What if I’m the chosen one and obtain some treasure in the Chaos Grave? I’m afraid it’ll be too late for you to regret it, right?”.
