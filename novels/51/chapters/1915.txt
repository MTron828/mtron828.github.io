1916 Uncle Yan Arrived

Looking at the noisy environment, Qin Yu was a little surprised.

After being in the Holy Region for so long, this was the first time he had seen such a lively place.

Although people were peddling herbs, divine weapons, and other items here, more were eating, drinking, and having fun.

Standing there, Qin Yu couldn’t help but think of the night markets on Earth, which were somewhat similar.

“What is this place? Why have I never heard of it?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but ask in surprise.

“This is a city square, and and most people who come here are of low are of low cultivation. So I’m not afraid of meeting people who know me,” Yan Ruoxue said mysteriously.

“It seems like it’s not your first time here,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

“To be honest, I’ve sneaked out three times. I was alone the first few times,” Yan Ruoxue said.

Upon hearing this, Qin Yu’s heart ached.

Obviously, the Yan family was nurturing Yan Ruoxue as the next Holy Lord. She probably did not have any freedom in her daily life.

Yan Ruoxue pulled Qin Yu to a small stall.

A pungent smell of delicious food was emitted from the stall.

Different from the delicacies of the aristocratic families, the smell of the food here was tremendously pungent, constantly stimulating the taste buds.

“Boss, two servings of meatballs, please!” Yan Ruoxue no longer behave like a young lady. She waved her hand as if she had become one of the crowd.

After a while, the boss came back with two servings of meatballs.

“Miss Qin, I haven’t seen you in a long time,” the boss said with a smile after seeing Yan Ruoxue.

Qin Yu was stunned.

Miss Qin?

He looked at Yan Ruoxue in surprise, and his eyes filled with confusion.

Yan Ruoxue explained in a low voice, “I just made up the name. Hurry up and eat. The meatballs here are all made from the meat of the wild beasts in the forest. They taste tremendously good!”

Qin Yu took a bite of the meatball in front of him. He couldn’t deny that it was indeed tasty.

Yan Ruoxue ate five servings in a row. Just as she was about to order the sixth serving, she quickly retracted her hand.

“What’s wrong?” Qin Yu asked.

“I have to save some space to eat other things,” Yan Ruoxue muttered.

After saying that, she took out a sum of money and put it on the table. She then pulled Qin Yu and went straight to the next stall.

This place was like a food street with all kinds of delicious food. Of course, the food here couldn’t bring any benefit to cultivation. Some ingredients to enhance the taste of the food here were even added but were harmful to cultivation.

Fortunately, in Qin Yu’s and Yan Ruoxue’s cultivation realm, the effects of this food were very limited. Therefore, the two didn’t care.

“Did you see that small tavern in front? That’s my favorite place,” Yan Ruoxue pulled Qin Yu and pointed at a small tavern not far away.

The small tavern was rather quiet, and there were not many people there. It was just that there was heavenly water nearby. Rumor had it that the wine here was made from the heavenly water river.

Yan Ruoxue pulled Qin Yu to the small tavern and sat down. She ordered two glasses of wine.

“Try and see,” Yan Ruoxue said excitedly.

Qin Yu took a sip and found the wine here tasted extremely strange. It was far inferior to the Jade Dew of the respective aristocratic families and sects.

However, Yan Ruoxue seemed to like the taste. After three glasses, her cheeks turned slightly pinkish.

Under the influence of alcohol, Yan Ruoxue’s face had an additional trace of charm.

“How is it? It tastes good, isn’t it?” Yan Ruoxue said with a smile.

“I like it,” Qin Yu quickly nodded and said.

“If we have time in the future, let’s meet here, okay?” Yan Ruoxue sounded somewhat like pleading.

This made Qin Yu feel extremely uncomfortable. After a moment of silence, he said, “Alright. As long as you have time, I can come to see you any time.”

“Hehe!” Yan Ruoxue laughed and leaned on Qin Yu’s shoulder. Her face was full of smiles of happiness.

After they left the tavern, Yan Ruoxue brought Qin Yu along to try on some clothes.

Although the material of these clothes was very poor, they were exquisitely made.

Probably Yan Ruoxue’s beauty had made these clothes look noble, or the clothes were bright and elegant, to begin with. In any case, Qin Yu was dazed by every piece of the clothes.

Unfortunately, Yan Ruoxue couldn’t bring these clothes back. She could only wear them for a moment.

At this moment, Uncle Yan had already rushed back to Mount Donghuang.

The first thing he did when he returned to Mount Donghuang was to look for Yan Ruoxue.

Unfortunately, Uncle Yan searched the entire Mount Donghuang but could not find any trace of Yan Ruoxue.

No one on the entire Mount Donghuang had seen Yan Ruoxue.

Normally, Uncle Yan wouldn’t overthink it. But now that Qin Yu had come to Mount Donghuang, he couldn’t help but feel nervous.

He stood at the edge of the cliff and slowly opened his arms. A ray of light instantly emitted from his glabella.

The light enveloped his body and then spread to the surroundings.

At a closer look, one could see rune after rune under the light. These runes were very mysterious as if they had a strange power.

A moment later, an image appeared in Uncle Yan’s mind.

And it was the scene of Yan Ruoxue leaving Mount Donghuang with Qin Yu!

Uncle Yan was deducing the past! It was a terrifying technique. He didn’t dare to imagine what he would see!

...

The more he deduced, the uglier Uncle Yan’s expression became.

Soon, he opened his eyes. His face was ashen, and his body emitted traces of coldness.

Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue were not aware of this. They had walked through the entire market, contested poems with people on the streets, watched the show under the roof and enjoyed seeing the flowers on the boat.

Yan Ruoxue leaned on Qin Yu’s shoulder and recounted the past in detail. No one mentioned anything related to cultivation.

But at this moment, Yan Ruoxue suddenly frowned.

“Someone’s coming,” she said in shock as she hurriedly got up.

“Eh? Someone’s coming?” Qin Yu was stunned.

Yan Ruoxue looked in a specific direction.

The void there was shaking as if it was about to split open!

A moment later, the void gate opened, and Uncle Yan appeared in the sky above the night market with a dozen people!

This scene shocked everyone in the night market. When they saw the word “Yan” on Uncle Yan’s long robe, they were even more shocked!

...

“It’s the Yan family! Why did the Yan family appear here?”

“Did someone offend the Yan family?”

For a moment, the entire night market was in a state of panic, and the previous cheerful atmosphere no longer existed. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Uncle Yan stood in the sky and looked straight in Yan Ruoxue’s direction. He then cupped his hands and shouted, “Chief Yan has received orders to bring the Yan family’s saintess home.”

His voice spread to every corner of the night market as if deliberately telling everyone of Yan Ruoxue’s identity.
