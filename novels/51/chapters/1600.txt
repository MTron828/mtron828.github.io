Chapter 1601: Chapter 1601, the situation in the northern lands: 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Iron Egg’s body emitted a dense killing intent that was extremely frightening.

Qu Zhu was slightly embarrassed and asked, “Then what should I call you?”

Iron Egg snorted coldly and said, “Call me Asura.”

Qu Zhu, who was at the side, didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He waved his hand and didn’t say anything else.

No one had a concrete understanding of iron egg’s strength, and no one dared to provoke him.

The next day.

Monk Hongxi came to wind bamboo mountain.

He stood in front of Qin Yu and the others and said slowly, “The thick fog in the northern lands has dispersed.”

Hearing this, everyone suddenly stood up and asked anxiously, “How is it?”

Monk Hongxi said slowly, “The northern lands has indeed suffered a heavy blow. Large areas of land have been turned into ruins. Rumor has it that the iceberg where the Lord of the northern lands is located is also riddled with holes.”

“But unfortunately, the three godly monarchs of the northern lands have not died. The revival of the Master of the northern lands has only been affected by time.”

Qin Yu hurriedly asked, “Then what about senior Xiao Hai? Is there any news of him?”

“Unfortunately, there is none.”The monk shook his head.

He took out the fragment of Xiao Hai’s mask from his bosom and said, “I plan to bury Xiao Hai’s mask on the Sichuan Immortal Mountain.”

Qin Yu looked at the fragment of the mask in the monk’s hand and felt an indescribable sadness.

It seemed that Xiao Hai was doomed.

He had done a great deal of damage to the northern land by himself and delayed the recovery of the Northern Land Lord.

“Before the Northern Land Lord recovers, there must be someone who can defeat the Northern Land Lord,”the monk continued.

“This person might be the master of the Heavenly Cloud sect, or it could be someone else, or it could be everyone.”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, then asked, “According to this progress, how long before the Master of the northern lands recovers?”

“Two months.”Monk Hong Xi stretched out two fingers.

“Two months...”Qin Yu immediately turned pale with fright.

This was a little too fast!

Since he was called the Lord of the northern lands, his strength was naturally extremely powerful.

Even the three great godly monarchs had already touched the reversion void stage, let alone the Lord of the northern lands?

If there were no accidents, the lord of the northern lands was definitely a top-notch martial artist at the reversion void stage!

Stepping into the reversion void stage in two months was simply impossible!

According to Qin Yu’s own calculations, he would need at least two to three years before he had the chance to step into the reversion void stage.

“The funeral is scheduled for tomorrow. I hope everyone can attend,”said monk Hongxi.

Qin Yu hurriedly cupped his hands and said, “Definitely.”

After saying that, monk Hongxi turned around and walked up and down.

“Big Brother Qu Zhu, in two months’time, do you have the chance to step into the reversion void stage?”Asked Qin Yu.

Qu Zhu shook his head and said, “It’s not that easy to step into the reversion void stage. It’s impossible to do so in two months.”

“What about the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect?”Qin Yu frowned and asked.

“Who knows? He hasn’t made a move for many years.”Qu Zhu stretched lazily. Although he was a little worried, he looked as if it had nothing to do with him.

“Is the lord of the northern lands very powerful?”Iron Egg snorted.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “Reversion void stage, do you think it’s strong?” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Iron egg sneered, “So what if it’s reversion void stage? My body is not afraid of him at all!”

“Moreover, I can step into reversion void stage at any time!”

Qin Yu was startled and hurriedly asked, “Is what you said true?”

Iron egg sneered and said, “This thousand years of suppression has allowed my temperament to have an extremely strong breakthrough. Everything is ready. I only need the East Wind.”

Qin Yu hurriedly said, “Then don’t waste time. Hurry up and go into closed-door cultivation!”

“Everyone has their own dao technique.”Iron Egg glanced at Qin Yu. “My dao technique is to kill the righteous path. Now that I have been following by your side all day, how can I cultivate?”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. For a moment, he didn’t know what to do.

“Isn’t that simple? The cultivators of the northern lands have been causing trouble in the southern region for a long time. Why Don’t you just kill them?”Qu Zhu said from the side.

Qin Yu also nodded and said, “That’s right. This way, you can cultivate your dao technique and also guarantee the lives of more people in the southern region. You might even become a great hero in the southern region.”

“I don’t care about being a great hero, but your suggestion is not bad.”Iron Egg’s face revealed an evil smile.

Qin Yu nodded repeatedly and said, “Then don’t waste time. You can set off now.”

“Really?”Iron Egg raised his eyebrows.

Qin Yu quickly said, “Of course!”

Iron Egg was instantly overjoyed! He simply didn’t want to be by Qin Yu’s side!

If it weren’t for the fact that Qin Yu had a powerful guardian father behind him, he probably would have already made a move on Qin Yu!

Now that Qin Yu had asked him to kill some northern land cultivator, he didn’t take it seriously at all.

To iron egg, killing who wasn’t killing? What northern land, what southern state, what does it have to do with me?

Of course, he did not tell Qin Yu and the others about this, so Qin Yu naturally did not know about it.

Iron Egg did not stay any longer. He quickly left wind bamboo mountain and disappeared without a trace.

After he left, qu Zhu asked from the side, “Qin Yu, who exactly is this friend of yours?”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “I’m not too sure either.”

Qu Zhu sighed slightly and said, “I’m really afraid that he will become a sword in someone else’s hand...”

...

The northern lands.

The three godly monarchs suffered heavy injuries and went into seclusion to recuperate.

The three of them were in the same room, slowly recuperating their internal Qi.

This battle had nearly caused them to fall in the northern lands.

If not for Xiao Hai’s strength being suppressed, the three godly monarchs would have long fallen.

“I didn’t expect the sect master of the Tianyun sect to have a younger brother...”a godly monarch said in a low voice.

Sima bei also sighed, “These two brothers are each more abnormal than the other. They are truly terrifying.”

“Fortunately, this Xiao Hai delivered himself to our doorstep. Otherwise, he would really become a great trouble in the future.”

“This is also good. Without Xiao Hai, wouldn’t the South Province be in the bag?”

The three of them looked at each other and a cold smile appeared on their faces.

In a room a few miles away.

Yong Ji, Baro, and Feng Hai were sitting cross-legged.

During this period of time, they had been cultivating the internal Qi of the Sacred Heart technique. The Aura on their bodies had obviously changed, and their strength had also increased greatly.

“The three godly monarchs seem to have been seriously injured.”At this moment, Yong Ji suddenly said, intentionally or unintentionally.

The other two were not fools, and immediately looked at Yong Ji.

“What do you mean?”Baro asked coldly.

Yong Ji spread his hands and said, “Nothing much. I just said that Xiao Hai is really terrifying. He actually nearly caused the three godly monarchs to fall in the northern lands. You have to know that the three godly monarchs’strength is far above ours.”

“Yong Ji, if you have anything to say, it’s better to say it directly.”Feng Hai laughed coldly.

“Your fancy tricks can’t escape our eyes.”
