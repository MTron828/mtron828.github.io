1789 The Witty Jue Wu

The burly man seemed to have strongly obsessed with Qin Yu. Now he had even issued a letter of challenge directly.

Of course, at this moment, Qin Yu was not afraid of him at all. It was just that the evil thought in his heart had been haunting him. Qin Yu was very worried that he would lose control once he attacked.

If he devoured the man’s primordial spirit in front of everyone, he would probably die.

“If you don’t want to die, take this letter of challenge back…” Qin Yu said, suppressing the evil thought in his heart.

!!

The burly man laughed and said, “You’re so boastful! Qin Yu, I know you have some ability, but don’t think too highly of yourself. It’s not your Nanzhou here. Anyone who can enter Thunder Courtyard is not bad.”

Then, the burly man threw the letter of challenge to Qin Yu and said, “Tomorrow, you and I will definitely have a battle.”

“You’re so f*cking shameless! A Reversion Void Stage cultivator challenging a mighty realm cultivator? Don’t you feel ashamed?” Jue Wu angrily said.

The burly man laughed and said, “Don’t worry. I, Cao Huang, have never bullied anyone. I will suppress my strength to the same cultivation realm as Qin Yu.”

After saying this, the burly man turned around and left.

Qin Yu’s face turned uglier. He seemed not to be able to bear it any longer.

When he was provoked, the evil thought in his heart instantly surged! It was simply difficult to restrain!

He sat there, trying his best to suppress this evil thought, and his forehead was sweating.

Jue Wu, next to Qin Yu, came forward and patted his shoulder. She said, “Don’t worry. Leave it to me.”

“Leave it to you? Are you going to act on my behalf?” Qin Yu shook his head.

“Don’t worry, I have my way,” Jue Wu grinned and said.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything else. He didn’t take Jue Wu’s words seriously.

He closed his eyes slightly to resist the evil thought.

The news of Cao Huang issuing a challenge letter to Qin Yu spread very quickly.

That night, Xiaobai came to the cave abode to look for Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly when he saw Xiaobai coming.

He pretended to be calm and said, “Xiaobai, why are you here?”

Xiaobai smiled and said, “It’s due to that idiot. He’s a battle maniac. He’s not targeting you. You don’t have to worry. He knows what he’s doing.”

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. And his forehead was covered with sweat again.

“Qin Yu, what’s the matter with you? Are you not well?” Seeing this, Xiaobai asked with concern.

Qin Yu opened his mouth but didn’t know what to say.

Jue Wu hurriedly walked up and waved her hand, “Qin Yu is not well. Let him have a good rest.”

Seeing that Jue Wu had given the order to leave, Xiaobai didn’t say anything else.

“Take good care of yourself. I’ll come and see you tomorrow,” Xiaobai said.

After saying this, Xiaobai turned around and walked out.

Not long after Xiaobai left, Jue Wu rolled up her sleeves and planned to go out.

“Where are you going?” Qin Yu quickly asked.

Jue Wu grinned and said, “I’m going out to do something and hang around for a while. You rest here.”

Jue Wu ran out without giving Qin Yu a chance to continue asking.

After an hour or so, Jue Wu was back, humming a tune.

“D*mn it! I’m so tired. I’m going to sleep,” she said while stretching.

Qin Yu frowned. He sniffed and found out there was a faint smell of blood on Jue Wu’s body.

“Where did you go?” Qin Yu asked.

“You’ll know tomorrow,” Jue Wu said mysteriously.

Qin Yu didn’t think much about it. He thought Jue Wu had gone out hunting. Thus he didn’t ask further.

The following day.

A large group of people gathered at the training ground of Demon-slaying Peak. Even the peak master was there.

Clearly, they were waiting for the battle between Qin Yu and Cao Huang.

“Let’s go. Don’t let those b*stards look down on us.” Jue Wu pulled Qin Yu and said.

Qin Yu sighed. He could only pray in his heart that he could restrain this impulse.

Thus Qin Yu followed behind Jue Wu and left the cave abode.

When they arrived at the training ground, the crowd saw Qin Yu and became restless.

“Qin Yu really showed up!”

“If not? If he doesn’t accept the letter of challenge, Cao Huang will have a reason to attack him directly. It makes no difference whether he shows up or not.”

“Sigh! It’s a little unfair. Qin Yu’s primordial spirit is damaged, and his physical condition is bad. Cao Huang seems to be taking advantage of him.”

“How would Cao Huang take advantage of others? He will suppress his cultivation realm so that the two of them would be on the same level.”

While the crowd was in a heated discussion, Qin Yu was extremely worried.

It was because the evil thought in his heart was constantly attacking his mentality as if it would break through his psychological defense at any time.

Time passed by. In the blink of an eye, an hour had passed.

However, Cao Huang still did not show up.

The sun was high in the sky, and everyone was getting impatient. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Hey, that Cao Huang doesn’t even dare to come. Does that mean he has lost?” Jue Wu looked in the direction of the peak master.

“If Cao Huang still doesn’t show up after a while, he’s considered to have lost,” the peak master said in a deep voice.

“Tsk.” Jue Wu sneered and whispered in Qin Yu’s ear, ” “This Cao Huang can’t come.”

Qin Yu was stunned and frowned.”Why can’t he come? You… What did you do?”

Jue Wu opened her mouth and was about to speak when she saw a cultivator carrying the injured Cao Huang over.

Cao Huang’s body was covered in blood, and a few of his bones were broken. His internal qi was extremely weak.

Seeing Cao Huang in such a state, Qin Yu hurriedly turned to Jue Wu and said, ” “This… You did this?”

Jue Wu hummed a tune and didn’t reply. What had happened was obvious.

“Peak Master, Cao Huang is seriously injured.” The cultivator placed Cao Huang on the ground and cupped his hands.

The peak master frowned. He looked at Cao Huang and said, “What’s going on?”

Cao Huang opened his mouth and raised his finger with great difficulty, pointing in the direction of Jue Wu.

“Did Qin Yu do this?” The peak master was stunned.

Cao Huang shook his head with all his might and said with trembling voice, “It’s… It’s…”

“Hey! Did you guys hear that? He has admitted to it, so that’s it.” Jue Wu quickly interrupted Cao Huang.

Cao Huang became even more anxious. He pointed at Jue Wu and said desperately, “Jue… Jue…”

“It’s definitely Qin Yu!” Jue Wu once again interrupted Cao Huang.

“Who else could it be besides Qin Yu? Okay, okay. Look at you. Hurry up and go back to rest,” Jue Wu said with a smile.

Hearing Jue Wu’s words, Cao Huang, who was already seriously injured, suddenly turned pale and spat out a mouthful of blood!

Seeing what happened, the peak master could not help but frown slightly. He waved his hand and said, “Enough! Quickly bring him back to rest.”

“Yes, Peak Master,”

Despite Cao Huang’s desperate struggle, he was still taken away.
