1866 The Mountain Protection Formation of the Tong Family

This Azure Dragon looked true to life, very much like the Azure Dragon recorded in the Classic of Mountains and Seas.

Its steel-like scales could block everything. Nothing could penetrate its indestructible body.

After all, this was the Tong family’s guardian divine beast. Its strength was needless to elaborate.

In an instant, even heaven’s favorites of Demon-slaying Peak were injured by the Azure Dragon.

!!

Its eyes exuded divine might. Wherever it passed, all things were wiped out, and the divine artifacts in everyone’s hands were destroyed. There were even some people with their flesh peeled off directly, revealing their internal organs.

“D*mn it! This beast! I’ll kill you!”

Facing the Azure Dragon, Chang Mang stood out.

His vast divine power, coupled with his incomparably tough body, arrived in front of the Azure Dragon in an instant. His scarlet fist smashed directly at the Azure Dragon!

“Boom!”

A loud bang reverberated through the air. One of the Azure Dragon’s scales was forcefully shattered by Chang Mang!

This move undoubtedly angered the Azure Dragon. It wagged its tail, which was like a steel pillar, and swept over!

Those who couldn’t dodge in time were directly shattered into pieces. It was such a tragic sight!

There were even some people whose bodies were destroyed in an instant. If they didn’t escape quickly, even their primordial spirits would have fallen!

Seeing this, Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. He clenched his Golden Fist and smashed a guest elder who kept entangling him. He then looked at the Azure Dragon coldly.

A terrifying killing intent was directed at the Azure Dragon. The surging battle intent on Qin Yu’s body swept across the entire Tong family!

As their eyes met, Qin Yu’s cold eyes stared straight into Azure Dragon’s pupils.

“D*mned beast.” Qin Yu coldly spat out a few words.

He stretched out his palm and took out the iron rod.

The pitch-black iron rod in Qin Yu’s hand exuded an incredibly terrifying pressure.

But in the next second, Qin Yu threw the iron rod at Chang Mang.

“This iron rod might suit you,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Chang Mang received the iron rod and tried swinging it a few times. He then said in surprise, “This thing is quite handy. I’ll kill this beast right now!”

“No, I want to kill him with my own hands,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The Azure Dragon was too huge. Although Chang Mang was strong, he had no way of taking its life in a short time.

If this continued, it would only cause more casualties.

The huge difference in size was difficult to overcome unless one had overwhelming strength.

Qin Yu looked at Azure Dragon coldly. A guest elder wanted to take this opportunity to sneak attack, but he was smashed into meat paste by Chang Mang, who had sharp eyes and quick hands. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qin Yu remained silent, but the golden light on his body became even more dazzling.

A few seconds later.

Qin Yu’s body was completely buried by the golden light! And these wisps of golden light rippled in all directions, forming an extremely huge body!

This body was tens of feet tall and incredibly huge!

And this technique originated from Qin Yu’s father’s cosmic form!

The huge body instantly stunned everyone!

“What kind of technique is this? Is this a vision?”

“No, it’s Qin Yu’s true body. How is this a vision?”

“How many more secrets is Qin Yu hiding?”

With the support of this huge body, Qin Yu’s aura soared!

The panicking Demon-slaying Peak disciples reinvigorated the battle intent!

Qin Yu looked at the Azure Dragon coldly. The killing intent in his eyes made the Azure Dragon’s body shake slightly. No one knew whether it was because of excitement or fear. However, everyone knew that at this moment, the Azure Dragon was feeling a little uneasy.

Driven by this uneasiness, the Azure Dragon’s pupils were the first to exude a divine might. It then charged directly toward Qin Yu!

The two rays of light emitted by the pupils seemed to be able to penetrate everything in the world. However, they could not penetrate Qin Yu’s body, which was as huge as Mount Tai!

His huge fan-like hand waved over and directly shattered the two rays of light!

In the next second, Qin Yu’s feet moved with the line word formula and appeared in front of the Azure Dragon in an instant!

A golden fist the size of a small mountain ruthlessly smashed toward the Azure Dragon’s head!

“Clang!”

It was as loud as thunder! It shattered the dark clouds lingering in the sky, revealing golden rays of sunlight!

After suffering such a severe injury, the Azure Dragon instantly became a little dazy!

Qin Yu didn’t want to give it any chance to catch its breath. He knew what it meant to be a guardian divine beast.

If the family existed, the divine beast would exist. If the family was eliminated, the divine beast would die!

Qin Yu raised his hands and smashed them on the Azure dragon’s head!

Qin Yu’s strength was so terrifying that his physical strength could destroy almost everything!

With just two punches, the Azure Dragon fell to the ground, and bloody wounds appeared on his huge head!

“What a tough body.” Qin Yu was a little surprised.

If it were an ordinary Demonic Beast, it would have been turned into meat paste under these two punches!

...

“Roar!”

The Azure Dragon seemed to have been enraged by Qin Yu as it raised its head and roared!

Qin Yu snorted coldly. He rushed forward and clutched the Azure Dragon’s neck. His other hand clenched into a fist and punched him repeatedly as if he was going to smash his head completely!

Although the Azure Dragon struggled with all its might, Qin Yu’s strength was too terrifying. After all, it was not Demonic Beast at the True Saint stage. In the face of Qin Yu’s destructive power, it soon could not hold on anymore!

At this critical moment, rays of light were emitted from all directions of the Tong family, followed by an incomparably sacred loud sound of an ancient bell!

This sound was extremely sacred, like the dao technique of Thunder Courtyard!

Under these sacred sounds, the Azure Dragon seemed to have been injected with some terrifying power. It actually directly jolted Qin Yu back!

Qin Yu, who was caught off guard, was forced back a few steps, and the golden light faded a little.

He looked at the Azure Dragon coldly and was about to make a move before the Azure Dragon suddenly leaped up and drilled into the sky!

“What?”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and was a little confused.

...

Could it be that the Azure Dragon was trying to escape? That was impossible! As a guardian divine beast, there’s no such thing as escaping!

Their lives had long been tied to their families. So even if they fled, they would vanish into thin air!

“Something’s wrong!”

Qin Yu soon realized that something was wrong!

This Azure Dragon seemed to have obtained the mysterious power of the Tong family’s inheritance. And it seemed to be about to activate some extremely terrifying techniques!

Thinking of this, Qin Yu quickly looked at the crowd and shouted, “Everyone, hurry up and come to me!”

Everyone from Demon-slaying Peak was confused.

“Boom!”

At this moment, a loud noise came from the sky. The entire sky then turned scarlet!

“Hurry up and come over!” Qin Yu shouted in a hurry!

He opened his arms and protected everyone under him!

In the next second, the scarlet sky began to descend with a terrifying radiance like divine punishment. The entire Tong family instantly turned into a tragic battlefield!

Those who couldn’t dodge in time were directly hit by this divine punishment and turned into dust!
