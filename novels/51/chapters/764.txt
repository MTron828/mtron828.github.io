“It’s from a Martial Saint?” Xiao Yu’s expression changed slightly. The surrounding people also looked at the man with the mustache.

The man with the mustache said with a gloomy look, “That’s right. This power definitely comes from a Martial Saint.”

“In other words, Blackie is using the power of a Martial Saint?” Someone asked.

The man with a man with the mustache frowned and said, “You can say that, but compared to a real Martial Saint, the strength that Blackie can display is far inferior.”

“Even if the strength that Blackie can display isn’t comparable to a real Martial Saint, it is definitely not something a Martial Marquis can compare with.” At this moment, someone from the side walked forward and said.

“Yes, I have also heard of it. It is said that hundreds of Martial Marquises once planned to besiege a Martial Saint, but in the end, they all died at the hands of that Martial Saint.”

“If that’s the case, I’m afraid Qin Yu will be in trouble.”

“Blackie is, after all, a member of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. They will certainly use unimaginable methods.”

For a moment, a trace of solemnity appeared on everyone’s faces.

“Even if Blackie wins, it won’t be an honorable victory. Even if Qin Yu loses, it will still be an honorable defeat,” someone said coldly. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

In front of them, Qin Yu was lifted into the air by Blackie.

His black palm grabbed Qin Yu’s head. The immense force made Qin Yu feel unbearable pain.

“What’s wrong? Qin Yu, where’s your ability?” Blackie said sarcastically.

“Is that all? So that’s all you have?”

Blood dripped from the corner of Qin Yu’s mouth. He was seriously injured.

He tried to break free, but he found that Blackie’s strength was extremely great. He couldn’t break free at all.

“Blackie, kill him quickly!” Granny Qin shouted.

She knew that there were too many possibilities hidden in Qin Yu’s body.

Blackie glanced at Granny Qin, then sneered. “Qin Yu, did you hear that? Granny Qin asked me to kill you.”

“To be able to make Granny Qin think about you so much, you’re considered very impressive.”

As he spoke, Blackie’s hand that was grabbing Qin Yu’s head kept increasing its strength.

“Ah!!”

The excruciating pain immediately caused Qin Yu to howl in pain.

He felt as if his skull was about to be crushed, and even his divine sense was trembling slightly.

“Venerable Fifth Mountain!”

Right at this moment, Qin Yu suddenly let out a loud roar and took out his magic weapon!

The Venerable Fifth Mountain instantly smashed towards Blackie!

Blackie snorted coldly. He raised his left hand to receive it, but he realized that the Venerable Fifth Mountain was incomparably heavy and couldn’t be stopped at all!

Helpless, Blackie had no choice but to throw Qin Yu aside and shoot into the distance!

Qin Yu, who had been freed, didn’t dare to be negligent. He took this opportunity to retreat quickly.

At the same time, a few pill pills appeared in his hand and he stuffed them into his mouth.

As the pill entered his stomach, Qin Yu’s injuries instantly healed substantially.

“Qin Yu! Don’t fight with him anymore. His strength comes from a Martial Saint. He is definitely not someone you can compare to!” The man with the mustache roared.

Qin Yu glanced at the man with the mustache and couldn’t help but clench his teeth.

“The power of a Martial Saint... No wonder.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“Qin Yu, run quickly! Blackie is playing dirty!” The man with the mustache roared.

“Noisy thing!”

At this moment, Granny Qin suddenly stretched out her palm and slapped the man with the mustache.

The man with the mustache hurriedly pulled Xiao Yu and ran hundreds of meters away.

“Little b*stard, you’d better shut your mouth. Otherwise, I don’t mind killing you first,” Granny Qin said sinisterly.

On the mountain.

Qin Yu clenched his teeth.

This was his only chance to find Yan Ruoxue. If he gave up now, he didn’t know when he would have the chance next time.

“The power of a Martial Saint... I want to try it too.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

He clenched his fists and golden light appeared once again.

Then, Qin Yu held the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist in his hand and charged towards Blackie again!

This time, Blackie didn’t move and allowed Qin Yu’s Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist to land on his body.

“Clang!”

The loud collision sound was immediately deafening!

Qin Yu’s figure was even forced back a few steps!

On the other hand, Blackie’s dark skin was still incomparably smooth and wasn’t affected at all.

“It can’t break through the defense...” Qin Yu frowned.

Seeing this, Blackie couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“Is this your power? Ridiculous, ridiculous!” Blackie roared crazily!

Qin Yu’s expression was cold. With a shake of his palm, he held the bronze sword in his hand.

This bronze sword could even leave a mark on the gate of the Immortal Slaying Sect. Blackie’s physical body was nothing.

“Blackie, this sword isn’t ordinary. You have to be careful!” Granny Qin shouted.

Blackie was a mommy’s boy. He always listened to Granny Qin’s words.

Therefore, he immediately looked at Qin Yu, adjusted his internal qi, and put on a solemn expression.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He held the bronze sword with both hands, and his spiritual power surged into the sword.

Rays of dazzling light began to surge on the bronze sword, and a terrifying aura spread out in an instant.

“Nine Absolute Beginning Slashes, third slash!” Qin Yu raised his hand and made the third slash!

He knew very well that the first two slashes definitely wouldn’t be able to hurt Blackie!

The sky-reaching sword light instantly appeared!

A terrifying aura spread throughout the mountain stream!

“Ah!”

Qin Yu let out an angry roar as the bronze sword in his hand ruthlessly slashed towards Blackie!

Blackie didn’t dare to be negligent. With a loud roar, he raised both of his fists at the same time and faced the sword light head-on!

“Boom!”

The terrifying internal qi collided and sent the surrounding onlookers flying!

Even the young masters of aristocratic families were shocked until they vomited blood!

Meanwhile, Han Wei was kneeling on the ground with several of his bones broken!

“How... how could this be...” Han Wei was in extreme pain, and filled with humiliation!

The current him couldn’t even withstand the aftershocks of Qin Yu’s collision!

“Can such power really be unleashed by a human...” the others couldn’t help but mutter in a low voice.

The light gradually dissipated, and Blackie shot out explosively!

He looked down at Qin Yu from above and grinned. “Looks like this is your trump card.”

“Even the third slash of the Nine Absolute Beginning Slashes couldn’t hurt him...” Qin Yu’s expression was extremely ugly.

After Blackie had obtained the power of a Martial Saint, his strength had already exceeded his imagination!

“Qin Yu, it’s my turn.” Blackie’s hands slid around, as if he was preparing some terrifying move.

In an instant, the power that engulfed the entire world gathered on his body.

After sensing this power, everyone’s faces turned extremely pale!

Even though they were very far away, they could still feel the terror of that power!

Qin Yu subconsciously took two steps back. That powerful power made Qin Yu feel an intense sense of danger!

“Things are bad.” The man with the mustache’s face was filled with shock, and his forehead was covered in layers of cold sweat.

“Under this technique, even Qin Yu definitely won’t be able to withstand it!”

That power was still ongoing, and under this power, the entire space was shaking.

“Quickly think of something!” Xiao Yu said anxiously.

The man with the mustache didn’t say anything. He kept stroking his beard while looking extremely anxious.

“I got it!” At this time, the man with the mustache seemed to have thought of something!

He hurriedly looked at Qin Yu and shouted, “Qin Yu, take out the landscape painting of the masked woman!”
