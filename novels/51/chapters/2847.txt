Furthermore, another factor was that he felt Qin Yu was more talented than the current him.

He would have a lot of achievements one day, so Cang Yunzi also had the mentality of investing.

Taking advantage of this period, Cang Yunzi also sorted out a lot of information related to the Heaven Burial Cave and handed it to Qin Yu.

Most of the information was vague and did not provide any concrete evidence.

Most of them were through the oral accounts of others. In short, the Heaven Burial Cave seemed to belong to a Land of Disorder.

That was a place that even the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom’s Path of Heaven could not reach. It was also known as the Dark Land of Disorder.

Therefore, both the Alester family and Fatty Situ chose that area.

Only the Land of Disorder was the safest.

What kind of power could make this place unreachable by the Path of Heaven?

Moreover, one of the messages made Qin Yu feel the strangest.

Every once in a while, the Heaven Burial Cave would give birth to a strange ability. Everyone in it could not avoid the absorption of this energy.

In this information, this ability was called the Power of the Ancients.

It was a power from the Primordial Chaos stage. The fact that it was named after this power also indirectly explained how terrifying this power was.

According to the records, the Power of the Ancients appeared here once contained the power to strip away one’s lifespan.

Anyone who entered would be deprived of a thousand years of life. Those who had less than a thousand years of life would immediately turn into bones after entering, without exception.

There was also the stripping of power of the realm. In other words, if you awakened the peak power, you would be reduced to the ninth level of the Dao Consciousness. If you were a Holy Consciousness expert, you would be reduced to the Dao Consciousness Realm.

Furthermore, it was recorded that Saints would also fall to the Holy Consciousness Realm if they entered.

Qin Yu’s hair stood on end. What kind of power was this?

If what was recorded here was true, then even a Saint could not resist this power.

No wonder Taoist Priest Cang Yunzi called this place the most dangerous place. If these records were true, then the Taoist Priest was not exaggerating.

Qin Yu’s expression was a little grim, but Fatty Situ and Luo Xueyi had also entered.

No matter what, he had to find them. He also wanted to confirm Reiya Alester’s condition.

The waiting time was different from what Taoist Priest Cang Yunzi had expected. Qin Yu waited for nearly half a month before receiving news from Cang Yunzi.

“Qin Yu, I’ve finally received news from them today. They’re heading to the Heaven Burial Cave today. They are probably finding a suitable teammate before they set off.”

Cang Yunzi knocked on the door.

After receiving Qin Yu’s response, he pushed the door open and walked in.

At this moment, his expression was a little surprised because Qin Yu had already replenished his powers of creation after half a month of cultivation.

The feeling that Qin Yu gave him now was like a deep pool of water.

He could only feel this kind of feeling from a powerhouse.

“Taoist Priest, what’s wrong?”

Qin Yu asked with a smile.

“It’s fine. Qin Yu, I’ll send you their coordinates in Lingxu City. However, I have to remind you that these two are not natives of the Saint Kingdom. They give me a very dangerous feeling. If you’re not confident, then forget it. Don’t easily accept their test.”

Cang Yunzi couldn’t help but shiver when he thought of the scene where he met them.

“It’s fine. I’ll settle this myself. Thank you, Taoist Priest.”

Qin Yu nodded.

He suddenly tapped Cang Yunzi’s head and a vast amount of information entered his sea of consciousness.

“What is this?”

When Cang Yunzi saw the contents of evolution, his face was filled with joy.

It was the evolution technique of the Power of Qian Kun, which Qin Yu had deduced with the help of the Investiture of Gods’ spatial power.

At this moment, countless images appeared in Cang Yunzi’s sea of consciousness. By the time he regained his senses, Qin Yu had already left his residence.

Outside Lingxu City in the land of myriad tombs.

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

He finally understood what Taoist Priest Cang Yunzi meant. The two persons stood in front of a tomb.

One of them was a young man with messy hair. His eyes were hidden in his hair and his body had a terrifying sword intent.

Qin Yu could feel that dangerous Spiritual Energy Sword even from a thousand meters away.

The other person was an expressionless child who looked to be in his early teens.

The child’s skin was a little too fair. For some reason, his body unconsciously erupted with his strength as if he had sensed some danger when he saw this child.

Qin Yu’s divine sense surged through the child’s body.

However, he felt he had hit an extremely stiff immortal stone, making him dizzy.

“Oh?”

The child glanced at Qin Yu in surprise.

Countless people had tried to test his strength this way, but without exception, they all suffered a backlash and fainted.

Some of them even suffered heavy injuries. Almost no one was as nonchalant as this person.

There were nearly a hundred corpses on the ground. Most of them were human Dao Consciousness experts.

Some had awakened the peak power, but they also died here.

Judging from the wounds, these people were all killed by a single sword.

The young man stretched out his hand from afar. The sky in front of Qin Yu suddenly split open and the entire world suddenly turned blood-red.

It was as if his surroundings had turned into a sea of blood with countless vengeful souls wailing and howling in it.

Qin Yu walked out of the passage in the sea of Spiritual Energy Sword.

A huge holy sword descended from the sky.

Boom!

The young man’s body sank tens of thousands of meters. Countless tombs around him exploded.

He pulled out his sword instantly and blocked the holy sword of the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The young man threw the sword into the sky. He opened his arms as if he was welcoming something.

The sea of blood churned as if it were boiling.

The world suddenly turned cold. An alternate world opened up for the young man.

In an instant, Qin Yu felt the internal qi of hundreds of millions of swordsmen.

Countless sword intents instantly shuttled out of the door. Tens of thousands of swords pierced through the place.

The entire Lingxu City turned into a world of swords. A blood-red sword intent slowly appeared from within.

It was as if it was the king of this foreign world. It had its consciousness. It locked onto Qin Yu the moment it appeared.

That extreme evil intent caused Qin Yu to frown.

The Mysterious Yin Celestial Sword!

The young man revealed a crazy smile.

The small sword in his hand was thrown at Qin Yu. The foreign power of the sword seemed to want to crush him into a meat pie.

Almost at the same time, the Spiritual Energy Sword of the ultimate evil creature pierced down.

The world of swords opened in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

The tide-like blood dyed his sea of consciousness red.

“Is this sword intent that stained with human blood worthy of being used in front of me?”
