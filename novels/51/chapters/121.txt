Chapter 122: Establishing Ties with the Lu Family Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

This huge force instantly caused the three hangers-on’s expressions to change drastically!

However, it was already too late to retreat! They could only brace themselves and charge forward!

“Boom!”

With this swing, the huge force actually directly sent the three people flying!

The few people fell to the ground with their faces pale, and some even vomited blood on the spot!

Liu Shihui suddenly stood up as he watched this scene in astonishment. He exclaimed, “How is this possible?!”

It had only been a night. How could Qin Yu’s strength have improved by leaps and bounds?

Qin Yu looked at Liu Yi coldly and said, “If there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave first.”

Liu Yi shouted angrily, “Stop right there!”

Qin Yu stopped and sneered. “Is there anything else?”

Liu Yi ignored Qin Yu and shouted, “Tao Shan, cripple him for me!”

After the loud roar, it fell silent. No one spoke.

“Tao Shan?” Liu Yi frowned and turned around to look. He found Tao Shan lying on the sofa while snoring.

This made Liu Yi’s expression turn ashen.

He had agreed to act according to the signal, but Tao Shan actually fell asleep at this critical moment!

“Wake him up!” Liu Yi said through gritted teeth.

The two people beside Tao Shan hurriedly walked over.

However, no matter how much they shouted, Tao Shan didn’t have the slightest reaction. He slept like a dead pig.

“Mr. Liu, Tao Shan was tired last night. I’m afraid he won’t be able to wake up for a while...” the two people standing beside Tao Shan said with slight awkwardness. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Liu Yi was instantly furious, but there was nothing he could do!

This was Tao Shan’s shortcoming. Once he fell asleep, it was as if he was dead. He couldn’t be awoken at all.

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh.

“Since that’s the case, then I’ll be leaving first.” Qin Yu glanced at Liu Yi before swaggering out of the Liu family’s residence.

The moment he stepped out of the Liu family’s residence, Qin Yu saw a Land Rover parked at the entrance.

After seeing Qin Yu, a middle-aged man hurriedly ran towards Qin Yu from the car.

“Mr. Qin!” The middle-aged man ran in front of Qin Yu and warmly shook hands with Qin Yu.

Qin Yu seemed to have expected this scene, and there wasn’t the slightest bit of surprise on his face.

“You are?” Qin Yu asked with a calm expression.

The middle-aged man took out his business card and said with a smile, “My name is Lu Shuming. I want to befriend you, Mr. Qin. I wonder if Mr. Qin will give me the honor to do so?”

“Lu Shuming?” Qin Yu thought about it carefully. He seemed to have some impression of this name and he was quite famous in South City.

“Mr. Qin, I have prepared a banquet. I would like to treat you to lunch,” Lu Shuming continued.

It was a good time for Qin Yu to expand his network, so he nodded and agreed.

After they got in the car, the car drove to the restaurant.

In fact, Qin Yu knew very well that the Lu family definitely weren’t the only ones who wanted to establish ties with him, but there were many others as well.

And their motive definitely wasn’t pure. Most likely, they wanted to use Qin Yu, or use the Yan family, who supported him.

Fortunately, Qin Yu wasn’t worried. In any case, in the end, there was no telling who would end up using who.

After a short conversation, he learned that Lu Shuming’s identity was similar to Lei Hu’s in Jiangcheng.

The difference was that Lu Shuming’s status far exceeded Lei Hu’s, and his business had expanded to the entire country.

In South City, Lu Shuming also supported a group of hangers-on. Not only were they not afraid of the Liu family, but they had also even been secretly competing with the Liu family for many years.

To Qin Yu, Lu Shuming was a good candidate for an ally.

“Mr. Qin, you were actually able to walk out of the Liu family unscathed. You really surprised us,” Lu Shuming said with a smile.

“That old fox Liu Yi must be afraid of the Yan family, who are backing you, right?” The person next to him also said.

Qin Yu glanced at them and answered truthfully, “The Yan family won’t interfere, and they don’t care about me. The reason I was able to walk out of the Liu family was that the people working under him are incompetent.”

“Haha, Mr. Qin, you’re right,” Lu Shuming laughed and echoed.

Even though he said so, he didn’t believe what he said.

In Lu Shuming’s opinion, Qin Yu was just trying to boast.

Qin Yu understood their thoughts, but he didn’t say anything.

In the entire Liu family, the strongest person was Tao Shan.

Although they didn’t fight, Qin Yu didn’t think that Tao Shan could win against him.

The car soon arrived at a restaurant. When they pushed the door open and entered, they saw that there were already a few people waiting at the table.

Qin Yu glanced at them. There were a total of six people. Among them, there were three Inner Strength Masters who weren’t weak.

One of the elders was probably as strong as Tao Shan.

The other two people were probably evenly matched with Liu Yi.

After sitting down, Lu Shuming said with a smile, “Let me introduce everyone. This is Mr. Qin Yu. Mr. Qin just defeated Liu Shihui last night.”

“Hehe, Mr. Lu, there’s no need for you to introduce him. Mr. Qin is a very famous person now,” someone beside him said.

“You humiliated the Liu family in front of so many people. You’re the first person in South City to do so!”

Hearing everyone’s praise, Qin Yu smiled and thanked them one by one.

At this moment, the old man spoke up.

He looked at Qin Yu and said indifferently, “Indeed, since you dared to challenge Liu Shihui in public.”

Upon hearing the old man’s words, everyone immediately gell silent and looked at him in unison.

From everyone’s reactions, it could be seen that this old man had a high status in the Lu family.

“Mr. Qin, let me introduce you. This is Wu Hongchang, one of the hanger-on shareholders of the Lu family,” Lu Shuming said with a smile.

“Mr. Wu is a legend in South City. Other than that to idiot Tao Shan, Mr. Wu has never lost to anyone, right?” Someone beside him said with a smile.

Even Lu Shuming nodded slightly and said, “That’s right. In order to keep Mr. Wu, I offered 10% of my shares.”

“Greetings, Mr. Wu.” Qin Yu nodded politely to him.

Wu Hongchang looked at Qin Yu indifferently and said, “I’ve seen the video of you and Liu Shihui fighting. Although you’re not bad, your moves are full of loopholes. If I were Liu Shihui, I’m afraid you wouldn’t be able to last even one move.”

Upon hearing Wu Hongchang’s arrogant words, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little displeased. However, due to his identity, Qin Yu didn’t show it.

Wu Hongchang continued, “At the age of thirty, you are only at the ninth stage of Inner Strength. You are indeed very mediocre.”

“However, for Mr. Lu’s sake, I can take you as my disciple and let you advance to the level of an Inner Strength Master Hands,” Wu Hongchang said indifferently.
