Chapter 477: Entering the Warehouse! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

With that, the Pavilion Master strode out of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

Although the Fifth Elder was worried, he could only watch from the side.

At the entrance of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, there was a very wide street.

At this moment, there was no one on either side of the street. There was only the rustling sound of the gentle breeze.

The Pavilion Master stood on the cold street and said aloofly, “Since you are already here, come out.”

It was silent.

In less than half a second, several figures leaped out from the darkness!

Ten half-step Martial Marquises surrounded the Pavilion Master.

Their internal qi was powerful, and a terrifying pressure filled the entire street.

It was obvious that they wanted to show the Pavilion Master their might.

“Are you planning to encircle and annihilate the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?” The Pavilion Master raised her brows, and the internal qi on her body suddenly burst out!

The collision of several internal qi instantly caused the air to rumble violently!

“Pavilion Master, you have misunderstood.” The ten half-step Martial Marquises retracted their internal qi.

The one leading the group was a man with the hooked nose. The man with the hooked nose took a step forward and said with an aloof smile, “I have long heard that Pyro’s Divine Alchemist Pavilion Master is unparalleled in the world. Seeing him today, he really lives up to his reputation.”

The Pavilion Master said expressionlessly, “There is no need to say such polite words.”

The man with the hooked nose bowed slightly and then said indifferently, “Pavilion Master, I know that you want to protect Qin Yu, but Hong Yi Sect is also determined to obtain Qin Yu.”

“I know that the Divine Alchemist Pavilion is powerful and has a high status in Pyro, but Qin Yu has a deep feud with us and we have no choice but to take revenge.”

The Pavilion Master’s brows furrowed slightly. She sized up the man with the hooked nose and said, “Don’t say such nonsense.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

When the man with the hooked nose heard that, he immediately burst out laughing.

“Alright then, please hand over Qin Yu, Pavilion Master.” The man with the hooked nose said indifferently.

“Another one who wants the Divine Alchemist Pavilion to hand him over.” The Pavilion Master shook his head.

She shot a glance at the man with the hooked nose and said, “Do you believe that with just a call from me, I will be able to prevent all of you from leaving Pyro?”

Everyone’s expression immediately changed drastically!

The man with the hooked nose’s expression gradually turned a little ugly.

“Pavilion Master, we don’t mean to offend you. It is just that this trip was decided by the higher-ups. If we fail to complete the mission, we will not be able to return.” The man with the hooked nose said coldly.

“I hope that you will not make things difficult for us.”

The Pavilion Master said with an aloof smile, “Alright, one month later, I will be able to get Qin Yu to leave the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

“At that time, I will not interfere.”

When the man with the hooked nose heard that, he frowned and asked, “Is what the Pavilion Master said true? It can’t be a delaying tactic, right?”

“That’s right. If you were to inform Pyro’s officials, we would be in deep trouble.”

The Pavilion Master said indifferently, “If you all don’t believe me, then please go ahead.”

After saying that, the Pavilion Master turned around to leave.

The man with the hooked nose hurriedly stopped the Pavilion Master. He took a deep breath and said, “Alright, I believe that the Pavilion Master is a woman of her word.”

“But... what if the Pavilion Master changes her mind at that time?”

The Pavilion Master said indifferently, “After a month, if Qin Yu doesn’t leave the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, I will come and face you on his behalf.”

The meaning of her words was very obvious.

If Qin Yu didn’t leave the Divine Alchemist Pavilion in a month’s time, then she would let Hong Yi Sect make a move on her.

The Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion was also very tempting to Hong Yi Sect.

After all, her alchemy skills were unparalleled in the world.

“Alright.” The man with the hooked nose cupped his hands.

“Then we will wait here. If we don’t see him in a month’s time, don’t blame us.”

The Pavilion Master didn’t say anything and turned around to return to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

...

At this moment, Qin Yu was sizing up the warehouse of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

In the huge warehouse, countless herbs were planted.

These herbs were growing at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Their speed was far faster than one could imagine.

Endless amounts of spiritual energy assaulted his face.

This wave of spiritual energy made his entire body feel comfortable and his blood boil.

It was also because of the existence of this warehouse that the Divine Alchemist Pavilion was able to reign supreme for a long time.

“This warehouse has an endless amount of spiritual energy. Could it also be hiding some treasures?” Qin Yu suddenly had an idea, and his eyes looked towards the ground.

An ordinary Spirit Gathering Formation definitely wouldn’t be able to provide so much spiritual energy.

Even if all the spiritual energy in Qinghe town was gathered here, there wouldn’t be so much spiritual energy.

‘There should be some treasure hidden here,’Qin Yu thought to himself.

This remained here because of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s prestige. Otherwise, it definitely would have been snatched away by others already.

‘I’d better hurry up and cultivate. Within a month, I should be able to step into the half-step Martial Marquis realm,’ Qin Yu thought to himself.

He took out the Three Pure Ancient Tree and found a place to sit down.

Then, he began his boring cultivation.

There was a young man sitting in the middle of a pile of lush and verdant herbs.

Above his head, there was a small emerald tree.

The surrounding spiritual energy formed a small vortex around Qin Yu.

And Qin Yu’s body was absorbing this spiritual energy ravenously.

...

Three days later.

“What on earth are the people of the Hong Yi Sect doing?!” Elder Qu, who hadn’t left, couldn’t help but curse inside.

“It’s already been three days, yet they still haven’t made a move.”

“Elder Qu, this is the Divine Alchemist Pavilion after all, and the Hong Yi Sect is an organization that has been blacklisted. They wouldn’t dare to make a move against the Divine Alchemist Pavilion in such a grand manner,” the person beside him said.

“That’s right, Elder Qu, why don’t... we go back and ask the sect master.”

Elder Qu didn’t say anything, but inside, he approved of this suggestion.

“The two of you stay behind. The rest of you, follow me back to the Saint Confucian Sect,” Elder Qu said.

“Yes.”

Elder Qu didn’t stay any longer and immediately returned to the Saint Confucian Sect.

The Saint Confucian Sect had a spirit spring.

This spirit spring could also provide an endless supply of resources.

To remain in power, they had to have sufficient resources.

There were even many sects that only relied on natural resources to establish their own sects.

At this moment, a young man was sitting cross-legged near this spirit spring.

“It still won’t do!” The young man opened his eyes, and a trace of annoyance flashed across his face.

“Stepping into the Martial Marquis realm isn’t that simple...” that hoarse voice sounded in his mind.

This young man was none other than He Teng.

A trace of anger flashed across He Teng’s face. He clenched his fists and said angrily, “If I don’t step into the Martial Marquis realm, how can I kill Qin Yu!?”

“He, Qin Yu, has made me suffer a great humiliation. Now, I, number one in the Central Plains, have become a joke!”

“If I don’t kill him, I will never be able to turn the tables!”

He Teng’s crazy roar showed how he was on the verge of a mental breakdown.

“It’s simple... as long as you hand over your body to me, I can kill him...” that hoarse voice sounded again.
