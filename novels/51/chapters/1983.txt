1984 Dean Lei’s Direct Disciple

The elder’s attitude was tremendously sincere. He didn’t seem to be lying at all.

However, Jue Wu said stubbornly, “Absolutely cannot!! I’ll take whatever I cut. It’s mine!”

“Little girl, I’m afraid it will bring about a disaster if this item remains in your hands,” the elder sighed and said.

“What bulls*it disaster? I think you’re just trying to con my treasure!” Jue Wu snorted coldly.

!!

“Even if it’s a treasure, do you think you can keep it?” the elder said with a bitter smile. “The news has spread. When you leave Sky City in the future, not only you be unable to keep this item, you might even lose your life.”

Hearing the elder’s words, Qin Yu suddenly felt the time had come.

He immediately stepped forward and said, smiling, “Sir, I don’t think anyone will attack Jue Wu.”

“Oh? Why did you say so?” The elder looked at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu cleared his throat and said, “Jue Wu is the closed-door disciple of Dean Lei in Thunder Courtyard. She is also the only closed-door disciple of Dean Lei.”

The moment he said this, everyone in the gambling house was shocked!

What? This little girl was actually Dean Lei’s disciple?

Dean Lei had stopped accepting disciples for many years, not to mention closed-door disciples!

“Qin Yu, are you telling the truth?” the elder narrowed his brows slightly and asked.

“Who would dare to lie about such a thing?” Qin Yu laughed.

After obtaining Qin Yu’s affirmation, the people in the surroundings were in an uproar.

“No wonder this little fellow is so strong. She’s actually Dean Lei’s direct disciple!”

“I was wondering why she dared to be so arrogant. She even looked down on the Si family. It turns out she has Dean Lei’s backing!”

Of course, Qin Yu said this because he feared the Si family would take action against Jue Wu.

Now that he mentioned Dean Lei, even the nine great aristocratic families would think twice.

The elder sighed and said, “Then I suggest you take it back to Thunder Courtyard and give it to Dean Lei. I think he will handle it well.”

“Don’t worry. We will certainly do that,” Qin Yu said as he bowed.

The elder opened his mouth and seemed somewhat reluctant. However, in the end, he shook his head and did not say anything else.

They had initially wanted to create trouble, but Jue Wu cut out such a thing unexpectedly. The two couldn’t stay any longer, so they took the demonic egg and left the Si family’s gambling house.

Walking on the street, Jue Wu kept rubbing the demonic egg with her hands while Qin Yu kept looking at her from time to time.

“I’m afraid this thing is indeed an ancient demon.” Qin Yu frowned and said, “I’ve also sensed a strong feeling of uneasiness.”

Jue Wu snorted and said, “I don’t care if it’s an ancient demon. I like this egg. I want to hatch it!”

Qin Yu did not know how to respond. But he also couldn’t say anything. After all, there was no conclusion about the origin of this egg.

This matter quickly fermented and spread.

Jue Wu had cut out an ancient demonic egg, and she was the closed-door disciple of the dean of Thunder Courtyard — these two pieces of news were enough to shake up the entire Holy Region.

Outside Sky City, Yang Tong’s face was ashen, while Gu Xinghe was silent.

“We have to find a way to get rid of that Jue Wu,” Yang Tong said.

Gu Xinghe said, clasping his hands behind his back, “I know she’s Thunder Courtyard’s dean’s disciple, but so what? It’s fine if we keep her under control without hurting her.

Yang Tong looked at Gu Xinghe coldly and said, “Do you know a Yao family’s Semi-Saint with a treasure died in her hands?”

Gu Xinghe was stunned. He clearly didn’t expect Jue Wu to have such terrifying strength!

“That girl isn’t simple. She’ll definitely bring unnecessary trouble If we let her stay by Qin Yu’s side,” Yang Tong said coldly.

“Therefore, no matter what, you must find a way to make her leave Qin Yu’s side.”

“That’s simple,” Gu Xinghe said with a smile. “Leave this to me.”

Yang Tong glanced at Gu Xinghe and said, “Have the people you sent to Nanzhou returned?”

“He’s already on the way. He’s already caught the person,” Gu Xinghe said.

“Mmm,” Yang Tong responded. His expression turned cold as he said, “After sending Jue Wu away, we’ll immediately take action!”

…

In the following few days, Qin Yu and Jue Wu didn’t leave the Imperial Palace.

In the palace, Jue Wu placed the egg in front of the prince.

After looking at it carefully, the prince shook his head and said, “I’m sorry. With my experience, I’m afraid I can’t see the origin of this item.”

“Even you also can’t tell?” Qin Yu frowned.

The prince laughed bitterly. “The royal family has indeed existed for many years. But when I was born, it was not during the most glorious period.”

“What about the royal family’s library? The royal family was once so glorious, so they must have left something behind,” Qin Yu asked.

The prince nodded slightly and said, “I was just about to say that. Why don’t you go to the library to take a look? There’re indeed a lot of histories recorded there, including the Immortal Slaying Sect you are interested in, the masked woman, and so on.”

“Alright.” Qin Yu quickly agreed.

Immediately after, Qin Yu followed the prince and planned to go to the library.

“Jue Wu, are you going?” Qin Yu asked.

At this time, Jue Wu was fully focused on that egg. She immediately rejected it without thinking. “I don’t like reading books the most. I get a headache whenever I read. I’m not going.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “You better behave and don’t cause any trouble.”

“You’re so annoying. You even dare to lecture me. Be careful or I’ll beat you up!” Jue Wu waved her little fist and said fiercely.

...

Qin Yu laughed bitterly. He did not say anything else and followed the prince to the library.

“I heard Jue Wu is the closed-door disciple of Dean Lei. Is that true?” the prince casually asked.

“It’s certainly true,” Qin Yu nodded.

The prince sighed, “No wonder he has such terrifying strength. It turns out that she’s the direct disciple of Dean Lei. Speaking of which, Dean Lei has only accepted one disciple in his life, and Jue Wu is the second.”

“Oh? Dean Lei has another disciple?” Qin Yu was a little surprised.

“Yes,” the prince said. “That disciple is also famous in the Holy Region now.

“Famous?” Qin Yu frowned, then said, “Why haven’t I seen him in Thunder Courtyard?”

“Because he left Thunder Courtyard and Dean Lei a long time ago,” the prince said quietly.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He looked at the prince and said, “Don’t tell me he’s working for the nine great aristocratic families!”

“Of course not.” The prince laughed. “In this world, the nine great aristocratic families are indeed the most powerful forces, but that doesn’t mean everyone will obey them. There are also numerous outstanding rogue cultivators in the Holy Region.

“I see.” Qin Yu nodded slightly. “Your Highness, what’s Dean Lei’s strength like?” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com
