As he looked at the shattered protective jade pendant, Qin Yu’s face instantly turned deathly pale!

“Ruoxue... Ruoxue...” Qin Yu’s pupils dilated!

He hurriedly looked at the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion and said, “Pavilion Master, I have to go to Jingdu immediately.”

The Pavilion Master frowned and said, “Go to Jingdu? Are you going to Jingdu to get yourself killed now?”

Qin Yu pulled down the rope from his neck. He pointed at a small fragment still hanging on the rope and said anxiously, “This is the protective jade pendant that I refined for Yan Ruoxue back then.”

“If anything happens to her, this protective jade pendant will shatter!”

“Now that the jade pendant has shattered, something must have happened to her. I can’t wait any longer!”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and was about to leave.

However, the Pavilion Master blocked Qin Yu’s path.

She shook her head and said, “There’s no need to be anxious before you find out what actually happened.”

“No need to be anxious? How can I not be anxious?!” Qin Yu said somewhat angrily.

“Everything I’ve done is for her. If anything happens to her, my life will lose meaning!”

The Pavilion Master was silent for a moment before saying, “Stay in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion while I go to Jingdu. If anything happens, I’ll tell you.”

Qin Yu was stunned. He frowned and said, “You will go to Jingdu?”

The Pavilion Master nodded slightly and said, “She is probably sick. I believe that the Yan family will let me treat her.”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said, “Pavilion Master, I will go with you.”

“No,” the Pavilion Master said coldly.

“Stay in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion and cultivate. If anything happens, I will inform you.”

Even though that was the case, Qin Yu was still extremely worried.

If something really happened to Yan Ruoxue, then to Qin Yu, it would be like the world ending.

“I will set off now,” the Pavilion Master stood up and said.

“As for the matter of the Meridian Circulation Technique, let’s talk about it when I return.”

Although Qin Yu desperately wanted to go to Jingdu, he knew very clearly that there was no point in him going.

The Pavilion Master of the Divine Medicine Pavilion had an extraordinary status. If she went, it might be the best choice.

“Okay.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“Pavilion Master, if there is anything, please let me know.” Qin Yu bowed deeply.

“Also, you must pay attention to your safety,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

The Pavilion Master didn’t say anything else.

She walked down from the attic and set off for Jingdu that very day.

...

Jingdu.

Yan Ruoxue’s face was pale, and she was lying on the bed in an extremely weak state. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

A group of servants, seemingly at a loss, surrounded her.

“Have you notified Mr. Yan?” Someone asked.

“Yes, Mr. Yan is probably on his way.”

Before she finished speaking, she saw Yan Sihai walk in from outside the door.

He was accompanied by a foreign doctor.

This doctor was a doctor that Yan Sihai hired from abroad. Not only was his medical skills superb, but he was also loyal to Yan Sihai.

“Yan Ruoxue, what tricks are you playing this time?” Yan Sihai said coldly.

Yan Ruoxue, who was lying on the bed, didn’t say anything. Her face was pale, and even her lips were pale. She looked extremely heartbreaking.

“President Yan, Miss Yan is really sick.” The servant at the side couldn’t stand it anymore.

“Yes, Miss Yan has been in this situation for a few days.”

Yan Sihai frowned. He sized up Yan Ruoxue, and it didn’t seem like she was faking it.

“Peter, quickly see what’s going on.” Yan Sihai waved his hand and said.

The doctor called Peter quickly walked to Yan Ruoxue’s side and carried out a series of examinations on Yan Ruoxue.

This examination lasted for a whole three hours.

But unfortunately, after three hours, Peter shook his head and said, “Mr. Yan, there is nothing wrong with Miss Yan’s body.”

“Nothing wrong?” Yan Sihai frowned.

“Could it be that she is faking it?”

Peter didn’t speak, as if he tacitly agreed with Yan Sihai’s statement.

Yan Sihai’s expression turned cold. He walked into the bedroom and shouted, “Yan Ruoxue, I’m warning you. Don’t play tricks with me! Do you think that faking it will work?!”

“President Yan, Miss Yan is not pretending to be sick,” the servant next to him explained.

“President Yan, she is your biological niece after all. You... you should find another doctor to see her.”

“Seeing Miss Yan like this, our hearts ache...”

These words immediately aroused Peter’s dissatisfaction.

“Are you doubting my medical skills?!” Peter said coldly.

The servants hurriedly waved their hands and said, “We... We have no such intention!”

“No? Then what do you mean?” Peter asked coldly.

“What? You don’t want people to doubt your medical skills even when it’s subpar?”

At this moment, a voice suddenly came from outside.

They saw Yan Yongxiu slowly walking in with a woman.

This woman was none other than the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

“What do you mean!?” Peter didn’t know the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

He angrily walked in front of the Pavilion Master and pointed at the Pavilion Master’s nose.

The Pavilion Master’s expression turned cold, and an internal qi directly cut off Peter’s finger!

“Ah!!!”

The excruciating pain immediately made Peter roar!

However, in the next second, the Pavilion Master waved her hand, and Peter’s finger was actually intact again!

This caused everyone to gasp!

Even Peter was dumbstruck! He kept looking at his finger and exclaimed, “How... how did this happen!?”

No one paid any more attention to Peter. Everyone’s gaze was focused on the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

“Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?” Yan Sihai narrowed his eyes and the corners of his mouth couldn’t help but curl up into a cold smile.

The Pavilion Master said indifferently, “Mr. Yan, in the entire world, only I can treat Miss Yan’s illness.”

“You?” Yan Sihai couldn’t help but sneer repeatedly.

“I can see that you guys are colluding. The reason Yan Ruoxue pretended to be sick was to find an excuse to meet you?” Yan Sihai said with a cold smile.

The Pavilion Master raised his eyebrows and said indifferently, “Mr. Yan, this is your family’s home. What can I do?”

“What? The famous Yan Sihai doesn’t even have this bit of confidence and courage?”

Yan Sihai’s brows immediately furrowed.

Just as the Pavilion Master said, this was Jingdu, the Yan family’s home! He had no reason to be afraid.

Moreover, Yan Sihai didn’t want anything to happen to Yan Ruoxue.

“Sihai, let the Pavilion Master treat my daughter’s illness!” Yan Yongxiu couldn’t help but say from the side.

Yan Sihai glanced at Yan Yongxiu, and then his gaze fell on the Pavilion Master.

“You have quite the guts. You injured a member of the Yan family, and you still dare to come to Jingdu alone?” Yan Sihai said with a nonchalant smile.

The Pavilion Master said with a nonchalant smile, “Why wouldn’t I dare to?”

“Hahahaha!” Yan Sihai immediately burst into laughter.

“As long as I put in the word, I can make you unable to leave Jingdu. Do you believe me?” Yan Sihai said with narrowed eyes.
