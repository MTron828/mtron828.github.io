2284 The Insidious Villain

“Don’t be anxious. Let’s wait for Master Hei Yu to finish refining his magical artifact.”

…

Several of them exchanged glances.

Suddenly, Qin Yu opened his eyes and looked in the direction of Hei Yu.

At this moment, Hei Yu had a troubled expression. The magical artifact embryo in front of him seemed to be unresponsive. He had encountered a situation similar to what had happened with Suo Lin before.

However, at that time, Suo Lin had the support of Qin Yu’s massive amount of spiritual energy. Furthermore, Suo Lin’s refining skills and strength were much higher than Hei Yu’s.

Qin Yu’s divine thought moved, and a stream of magma with the highest temperature spewed out.

It turned into an arm-sized lava pillar in the air and surged into the furnace.

Hei Yu’s expression changed. However, when he sensed that this lava was here to help him, he calmed down and continued to refine that magical artifact.

“I’ll definitely hold you responsible if anything happens to my magical artifact!”

The sixth-grade guard seemed to have sensed the fluctuation on Qin Yu’s side and thought he had used some methods. His face instantly turned grim.

“Dogs’ barking.”

Qin Yu did not even look at that guy and sat cross-legged again. He only respected those who forged weapons, such as Master Suo Lin.

At that time, Suo Lin insisted on completing the divine artifact even if he had to sacrifice his life, which really shocked him.

Not long after, with Qin Yu’s help, that treasure was soon completed under Hei Yu’s refinement.

It was a silver spear, and massive Holy Power was blooming at the tip of the spear.

“Great! It was actually a peak Saint Weapon. As expected of Master Hei Yu!”

A hint of ecstatic expression flashed across the faces of the people beside Hei Yu. He initially thought it was just an ordinary Saint Weapon, not expecting Hei Yu to refine a Peak Saint Weapon. A Peak Saint Weapon magical artifact signified that he had secured a position in purgatory.

“My friend Wang Qing, you’ve gathered sufficient materials for this spear, and I’ve charged you so much, so there’s nothing to be proud of refining a Peak Saint Weapon. Moreover, it should be due to that friend’s help. Otherwise, the quality of this spear wouldn’t be so high!”

Hei Yu walked toward Qin Yu and bowed to him respectfully.

For a master refiner, it was their honor to refine the most exquisite magical artifact.

“Whoosh!”

A flash of cold light suddenly shot out and fiercely pierced Hei Yu’s chest.

“You?”

Hei Yu clutched his chest in disbelief and fell.

“Big Brother, why did you kill Master Hei Yu?”

The three people were tremendously surprised and could not believe what they saw.

“The fees this old follow charged me were enough to bankrupt me. How do we brothers cultivate if I don’t get this money back?”

Wang Qing revealed a ferocious expression.

“Moreover, this is the core of the Fire Unicorn Continent, and no one will come here. Even if we kill him, no one will know. Or we could wipe out this person’s divine sense and say that he killed Master Hei Yu!”

Wang Qing pointed at Qin Yu with a cold smile.

Qin Yu’s face revealed a cold expression. His chaotic power had protected Master Hei Yu’s heart meridian. Fortunately, that attack did not pierce through Hei Yu’s heart.

“Brother, what do you have to say? This magical artifact of mine could have reached the tribulation grade, but you interfered and affected the master, causing this supreme treasure to fall to the Saint Weapon grade.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Killing intent flashed across Wang Qing’s eyes. As he spoke, he slowly walked toward Qin Yu.

“Captain, he’s most probably Qin Yu, the one who obtained Master Suo Lin’s divine artifact.”

Someone said nervously in Wang Qing’s ear.

Wang Qing’s expression changed. He had heard of Qin Yu’s vicious reputation. He managed to kill the Palace Master of Azure Firmament Sect, Ming Yue, despite being surrounded by Azure Firmament Sect and Mysterious Dark Sect. He was indeed a ruthless person.

“Big Brother, I heard that when the seventh level of purgatory exploded, this person was severely injured and not much spiritual energy left in his body.”

One of them said with a gloomy expression.

“Yes, if we let him leave now and he starts spreading rumors everywhere, we won’t be able to stay in this galaxy anymore.”

Killing a master refiner was a treacherous act and was scorned by people even in this chaotic galaxy.

“Rumors remain as rumors. I want to see how a fourth-grade True Saint can kill me.”

Wang Qing’s expression turned ruthless. His spear shook like a silver dragon coming out of its cave, and a terrifying aura seemed to pierce through space.

“Ding!”

Qin Yu’s left hand grabbed the tip of the spear. The moment his palm collided with the spear tip, sparks burst out.

The spear was like a chick had its neck pressed, and its momentum instantly stopped.

Qin Yu’s arm moved, and Wang Qing was flung away. After that, the silver spear landed in Qin Yu’s hand.

Qin Yu flicked her finger lightly at the spear shaft, and the silver spear turned into a silver stream of light that pierced through Wang Qing’s heart.

His body was hanging on the spear, which first half was stuck in the ground.

It was right in front of Hei Yu as if bowing in repentance.

The remaining three people wanted to escape, but Qin Yu did not even look at them and slapped out with his palm, directly slapping the three into meat paste.

“Master Hei Yu, are you alright?”

Qin Yu grabbed Hei Yu’s arm and helped him up.

“I’m fine. Thank you for helping, my friend. I didn’t expect this person to attack me suddenly.”

Hei Yu’s face was ashen. Although this blow did not endanger his life, he would still require some time to recover.

“It’s good that you’re fine. It’s tremendously fortunate that Master didn’t die at the hands of such a despicable person.”

Qin Yu nodded.

“I’m usually in the Heavenly Cloud Continent. I’ll do my best to help if you need my help in the future!”

Hei Yu cupped his hand toward him.

“Master Hei Yu, you can take this spear.”

Qin Yu pointed at the spear and said.

“This spear belongs to you now.”

Hei Yu coughed and spat a wad of blood foam.

He staggered as if he had not recovered from what had just happened.

Seeing Hei Yu refuse to take the spear, Qin Yu did not insist anymore.

There were still many master refiners and cultivators in the periphery. There should not be any more danger to his life.

Qin Yu arrived at the volcanos at the very center and stepped on the lava.

Suo Lin Divine artifact on his left hand started to vibrate slightly. He came to the center of the dense fire attribute, and the boxing gloves also began to get excited.

Numerous fire energy surged into his body, and Qin Yu’s body at this moment became the center of the vortex.

Under the control of the unicorn’s inner core, the terrifying fire energy almost materialized.

“Traceless Immortal Scripture!”

Qin Yu’s body released a massive devouring power. Qin Yu seemed to have transformed into a black hole, ceaselessly devouring the ferocious fire energy.

He split half of the spiritual energy into the Sumeru Space, and several people within the space began to cultivate with Qin Yu.

Qin Yu took almost half a month to replenish his chaotic qi.

“It would probably take me three to four months to replenish my chaotic qi at other places.”

Qin Yu shook his head with a bitter smile.

This time, his cultivation was obviously much slower. The earth and heaven energy of the Fire Unicorn Continent had not completely recovered after he had absorbed it last time.

“Qin Yu, where the hell did you go?”

Jue Wu’s voice suddenly sounded.
