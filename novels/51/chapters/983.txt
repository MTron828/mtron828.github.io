Chapter 984: Chapter 984, Unimaginable!

Gu Xinghe’s scheming made Zhai Xing feel a little scared.

He looked at Gu Xinghe in front of him and didn’t know what to say for a moment.

“Alright, Uncle Zhai Xing, I know what to do.”Gu Xinghe waved his hand and ignored Zhai Xing.

...

The next day.

The number of deaths had reached 25.

This immediately made Qin Yu begin to pay attention to it.

He and the handlebar mustache came to the door of the corpse room.

Looking at the corpse on the ground, Qin Yu could not help but frown slightly.

“This technique... seems somewhat familiar.”Qin Yu’s expression did not look too good. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“It’s he teng again?”Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed slightly, and his expression could not help but become a bit cold.

Before the discussion hall, he teng had used this technique and framed Tian Xuehong.

He didn’t expect that he would appear again at the Hundred Spirits Meeting!

“This he teng... We really can’t let him stay!”Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little resentful.

“Mr. Qin, you have to be careful recently.”At this time, a stranger beside him whispered.

Qin Yu said with some confusion, “Me? What am I careful of?”

The other party said mysteriously, “There are rumors in the crowd now that the killing method is very similar to the one you used before!”

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed! He had a bad premonition in his heart!

“Of course, I definitely don’t believe it!”The martial artist added another sentence.

“Mr. Qin was willing to risk his life for everyone. Why would he do such a Thing?”

Qin Yu bowed slightly and said, “Thank you for Your Trust.”

Even though he said so, the worry in Qin Yu’s heart became more and more serious.

The Mustache Man at the side came forward and said, “What are you worried about? Didn’t those people say that they didn’t believe that you did it?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Three people make a tiger. No matter how fake it is, once there are too many rumors, it will become true.”

The man with the handlebar mustache touched his chin and seemed to think that it made sense.

“How about... We leave the Society?”The Man with the handlebar mustache asked.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “Do you think it’s useful to leave? If we leave, we will not be able to clear our name.”

“Then what should we do?”The mustached man asked.

Qin Yu opened his mouth, but he couldn’t think of a good idea.

“If we can find he teng before then, it’s naturally for the best.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

With that, he released his divine sense, covering almost the entire hundred spirits society!

But unfortunately, Qin Yu couldn’t find he teng.

“I suspect that this matter is related to the martial arts association of Jingdu,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“Something to do with them?”The Mustache Man could not help but feel a little surprised.

Qin Yu hummed in gratitude and said, “If it really has something to do with them... then we’ll be in trouble.”

“Forget it. I’m doing my job properly. If it’s not something I did, no one can pin it on me.”Qin Yu waved his hand and said.

Right now, for Qin Yu, the most important thing was to find out as soon as possible how to become a martial saint and find the heavenly vanilla.

When he returned to his residence at night, Qin Yu took out the scarlet fire leaf.

This scarlet fire leaf looked ordinary. Not to mention Qin Yu’s eyesight, even his handlebar mustache could not tell that it was extraordinary.

“How should I use this scarlet fire leaf?”Qin Yu asked in his mind.

Tie Dan said, “Don’t you have spiritual fire? Throw this scarlet fire leaf into the spiritual fire. Of course, control the strength of the fire. Otherwise, it might destroy this scarlet fire leaf.”

Qin Yu immediately nodded when he heard this.

He held his breath and stretched out his palm, and a wisp of spiritual fire fell into his palm.

The purple flame danced in the darkness like a dance, looking beautiful and enchanting.

Qin Yu used his other hand to pick up the scarlet fire leaf and put it into his right hand.

Then, Qin Yu focused all his attention on the flame and carefully roasted the scarlet fire leaf.

A few minutes later, the scarlet fire leaf started to shine with a golden light like gold!

As the spiritual fire burned, the golden light grew brighter and brighter!

The outer skin began to peel off, revealing layers of gold!

“Enough, enough!”

At this moment, Iron Egg’s voice sounded in his mind.

Qin Yu hurriedly put away the spiritual fire and looked at the scarlet fire leaf.

At this moment, the Scarlet Fire Leaf was flickering in the darkness like a red-hot meteorite.

“Well done, Qin Yu! Your eyesight has improved. You actually got a scarlet fire leaf?”The mustached man at the side said in surprise.

Qin Yu said in surprise, “You actually know that this is a scarlet fire leaf?”

“Nonsense. I’ve traveled all over the world. What haven’t I seen?”The mustached man said with a smile.

Qin Yu didn’t think too much about it. However, tie Dan in his mind said coldly, “I’m afraid this friend of yours isn’t simple.”

“HMM? Why do you say that?”Qin Yu said with some confusion.

Tie Dan said coldly, “As far as I know, the scarlet fire leaf has disappeared for more than a thousand years. Unless it’s someone who has lived for more than a thousand years, it’s impossible to recognize it at first glance.”

Qin Yu scratched his head and said, “You’re thinking too much. There are many things from a thousand years ago. Many people can still recognize it.”

“The scarlet fire leaf is different. This thing completely disappeared a thousand years ago. There’s no record of it,”tie Dan continued.

“He may be able to tell that this thing is extraordinary, but it’s impossible for him to know that this thing is called the scarlet fire leaf. Unless he existed a thousand years ago!”

Qin Yu could not help but look at the handlebar mustache in surprise.

He had long guessed that the handlebar mustache was not simple, but he never thought that he had actually lived past a thousand years!

“Hey, Qin Yu, can I use this treasure map to exchange with you?”The handlebar mustache leaned forward and said with a smile.

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “Go to Hell, in your dreams.”

“Cheh, stingy,”the handlebar mustache muttered.

Qin Yu carefully picked up the scarlet flame leaf and planned to refine it at this time.

“By the way, you have to take good care of this scarlet flame leaf. This item can raise your divine sense.”The mustached man beside him reminded.

After he finished speaking, he even muttered, “Comparing people really pisses me off. With your physique, you are already invincible after stepping into the martial saint realm. Now, you can raise your divine sense again...”

“God, I really can’t imagine what it will be like when you become a martial saint. Who knows, you might even be able to fight against a mighty figure...”
