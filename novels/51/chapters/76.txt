Upon hearing the words of these two people, Li Yan immediately flew into a rage!

He stood up abruptly and berated angrily, “Gao Tingting, I’ve already broken up with you long ago. Don’t be so b*tchy! Hurry up and get lost!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The expression of the short-skirted woman called Gao Tingting changed. She gritted her teeth and said, “Li Yan, how dare you talk to me like that? Just you wait!”

After saying that, Gao Tingting turned around and left.

Li Yan’s expression didn’t look too good, and he was much more sober now.

Qin Yu asked casually, “Who is that person?”

Li Yan forced a smile and said, “My ex-girlfriend. I found out that she cheated on me, so we broke up. I didn’t expect to meet her here today.”

When he heard this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel sympathy.

Wasn’t this encounter exactly the same as his?

Qin Yu reached out and patted his shoulder while comforting him, “You will meet a better girl in the future, so good that you can’t believe that there’s such a girl in your life.”

These words were meant for Li Yan, but also for Qin Yu.

“Thank you, Mr. Qin.” Li Yan grabbed the wine and suddenly poured it into his mouth.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything else. He raised his head and looked in the direction of the ring.

In the ring, two muscular men who were more than six feet tall and weighed more than 200kg were fighting for their lives.

Fists hitting flesh brought the scene to a climax.

Qin Yu drank his beer while enjoying the fight in the ring.

“These people are no good.” Yao Qing couldn’t help but shake his head.

Qin Yu joked, “If you go on stage, how long will it take for you to beat them?”

Yao Qing said with some pride, “If I don’t knock him to the ground in half a minute, I’ll lose.”

Qin Yu smiled and didn’t comment.

At this moment, Gao Tingting walked over.

Beside her was an extremely burly man.

That man was extremely burly and was practically the size of a small mountain! He was almost two meters tall! He was extremely eye-catching in the crowd!

When he saw this burly man, Li Yan’s expression immediately turned extremely ugly!

“Mr. Qin, let’s hurry up and leave!” Li Yan grabbed Qin Yu’s arm and said hurriedly.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “If you want to leave now, I’m afraid it’s already too late.”

As expected, Gao Tingting quickly ran over and grabbed Li Yan’s arm.

“What? You want to run now? Are you afraid now?” Gao Tingting sneered.

Li Yan braced himself and said, “Who... who says I wanted to run? Can’t I go to the bathroom?”

“Sit here for me!” Gao Tingting sneered.

As she spoke, the brawny man had already walked to the table.

He sized them up and said, “Tingting, which one is your ex-boyfriend?”

Gao Tingting pointed at Li Yan and said, “Brother Boar, it’s him!”

“You’re Li Yan?” The Man called Brother Boar walked to Li Yan.

It was impossible not to be afraid when facing such a terrifying figure.

Li Yan’s lips trembled as he said, “You... who are you? What do you want?”

“My name is Brother Boar. Didn’t you scold me on the phone last time?” The brawny man sneered.

When he heard this, Li Yan’s expression changed. He said with some anger, “Was it you who slept with Gao Tingting last time?”

“Hahaha, that’s right, it was me!” Brother Boar sneered.

After saying that, Brother Boar raised his huge hand and patted Li Yan’s shoulder. He sneered and said, “You said you wanted to kill me last time, but I’m right in front of you now. Why are you cowardly?”

Li Yan’s face was ashen, and his heart was filled with bitterness.

How could he be a match for such a burly man?!

“Hmph, look at Brother Boar, and then look at you. You’re simply a good-for-nothing!” Gao Tingting’s slender body leaned against Brother Boar’s body as she said in a sweet voice.

Li Yan gritted his teeth, but he didn’t dare to say anything.

When he saw this scene, Qin Yu’s expression was extremely ugly.

This was exactly the same as what he had experienced back then.

“Brother Boar, stop talking nonsense with him. He just scolded me and even defended that b*tch! !” Gao Tingting said angrily.

Brother Boar laughed. “Babe, what do you want to do?”

Gao Tingting gritted her teeth and said, “I want him to lick the soles of my shoes! As for that b*tch, Brother Boar, you can do whatever you want.”

When he heard this, Brother Boar couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

He sized up Song Wei and said with a wicked smile, “This little girl is pretty good-looking, but I don’t know if she can tolerate me?”

A hint of fear flashed in Song Wei’s eyes, but she still mustered up her courage and berated, “What do you want to do?! I’ll call the police!”

Brother Boar froze for a moment before it burst into laughter.

“Little girl, you have quite a temper. Go ahead and call the police. I’ll see if you’re faster or if I’m faster.” Brother Boar laughed evilly.

“Come at me if you want to do anything!” Li Yan seemed to have gone all out as he raised his fist and thrust it at Brother Boar’s body.

However, with his meager strength, punching Brother Boar’s body was almost like scratching an itch for Brother Boar.

Brother Boar glanced at him and sneered while saying, “You didn’t eat?”

Li Yan’s expression became even more unsightly. He braced himself and said, “If you have the ability, then beat me to death!”

Brother Boar narrowed its eyes and laughed evilly, “Alright, then I’ll satisfy you.”

Qin Yu’s expression was ice-cold. He glanced at Yao Qing and said, “I really don’t like this despicable couple.”

Yao Qing nodded. He rubbed his fist and said, “Mr. Qin, got it.”
