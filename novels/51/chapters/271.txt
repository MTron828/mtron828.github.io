Hui Ming wasn’t worried at all. He was even a little excited.

He was just thinking about how to catch Qin Yu, BUT he didn’t expect Qin Yu to deliver himself to his doorstep.

Qin Yu released his spiritual sense and scanned his surroundings.

Soon, he found Xiao Yu lying inside the apparatus!

Qin Yu’s expression instantly turned extremely ugly!

He immediately strode towards the tool to save Xiao Yu.

“Stop him!” Hui Ming ordered coldly.

“Yes!”

Several people immediately pounced towards Qin Yu’s direction!

However, Qin Yu didn’t even look at them. The qi energy on his body suddenly burst out!

“Boom!”

The surging terrifying qi energy sent these people flying!

The weaker ones died on the spot!

Hui Ming’s pupils dilated and his brows furrowed tightly.

Qin Yu... seemed to have become stronger again!

“Let’s attack together and stop him!” Hui Ming said coldly.

The eight elders nodded. They soared into the air and stood in mid-air. They chanted incantations silently and activated the Earth Fiend Valley’s spell!

“Hualala!”

As the spell was activated, eight wrist-thick chains suddenly appeared in the air!

The chains rushed at Qin Yu at an extremely fast speed. In the blink of an eye, they tied Qin Yu up!

His wrists, ankles, waist, abdomen, and even neck were all tightly bound by the chains. He couldn’t move at all!

Qin Yu’s footsteps also stopped.

Hui Ming sneered and said, “Qin Yu, don’t forget where you are. This is the Earth Fiend Valley! This is my territory!”

“You dare to act so brazen in my territory? Do you really think that the Earth Fiend Valley is a joke?”

After saying that, Hui Ming walked toward Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, I want this body of yours!” Hui Ming grinned and said coldly.

At this moment, Qin Yu raised his head.

He looked at Hui Ming coldly and said, “You want to trap me with just these eight chains?”

Hui Ming’s expression changed. He suddenly felt a sense of danger!

Before he could react, a golden light appeared on Qin Yu’s body! Endless power burst forth!

“Boom!”

Qin Yu roared angrily, and the eight chains immediately made a loud clang!

The expressions of the eight elders were extremely unsightly. They hurriedly pressed their palms together to stabilize the chains.

“Kacha!”

Unfortunately, the qi energy on Qin Yu’s body was too great, and it actually shattered the chains!

“Phew!”

The eight elders instantly suffered a backlash, and their bodies were sent flying before slamming into the wall!

Hui Ming’s expression immediately became extremely gloomy, and he took two steps back.

At this moment, he suddenly realized that the Qin Yu in front of him was completely different from last time.

The difference in strength was worlds apart!

Qin Yu ignored Hui Ming, and walked in front of Xiao Yu. With a shake of his big hand, he shattered the tool into pieces!

Xiao Yu’s body fell from the sky.

Qin Yu quickly stretched out his arm and caught Xiao Yu in his arms.

At this moment, Xiao Yu was on the verge of losing consciousness.

She looked at Qin Yu in a daze and whispered, “Qin Yu, is that you...”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Have a good sleep. You’ll be fine.”

Feeling Qin Yu’s warm embrace, Xiao Yu suddenly felt a sense of security.

She laid in Qin Yu’s arms and fell into a deep sleep.

Qin Yu turned to Jiang Gu and said, “Jiang Gu, keep an eye on Xiao Yu.”

“Mr. Qin, you’re alone...”

“Don’t worry. They’re no match for me,” Qin Yu interrupted Jiang Gu.

After that, Qin Yu handed Xiao Yu to Jiang Gu.

Then, he looked up at Hui Ming.

Countless thoughts flashed through Hui Ming’s mind, and the expression on his face changed again and again. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

In the end, a smile appeared on Hui Ming’s face.

At this critical moment, when the ancestor was about to be resurrected, he couldn’t take the risk!

Therefore, Hui Ming put on a smile and said gently, “Qin Yu, there is no deep enmity between us. There is no need to cause such a scene.”

“Oh really?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and was somewhat surprised.

Hui Ming continued, “The grudge between us is because of this girl. I will return her to you now and we will be even. How about it?”

“Oh really? You don’t want my body anymore?” Qin Yu sneered.

Hui Ming sighed and said, “To be honest, this isn’t entirely my fault. The main reason is that the temptation of the chaotic body is too great. I temporarily lost my rationality.”

“From now on, I promise that I will never covet your body again. How about that?”

Although he said that, he had another idea in mind.

When the ancestor resurrected, he would definitely cut him into a thousand pieces!

“Mr. Qin, how about that?” Hui Ming saw that Qin Yu didn’t speak, so he continued to ask.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “You made me run so far and caused me so much trouble, but now you want to send me away with just a few words?”

Hui Ming’s mind raced and he quickly said, “The Earth Fiend Valley will naturally compensate you.”

After saying that, Hui Ming reached out his palm and a snake skin bag fell into his hand.

“This is the holy medicine of the Earth Fiend Valley. It will have a magical effect on you.” Hui Ming handed the snake skin bag to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu opened the snake skin bag and took a look. Inside, there were pill after pill.

And almost all these pills contained extremely strong spiritual energy inside.

This made Qin Yu somewhat surprised.

Didn’t the Earth Fiend Valley cultivate dark energy? How could they refine pills that contained spiritual energy?

“Qin Yu, the Earth Fiend Valley can supply you with this kind of pill for a long time. How about it?” Hui Ming continued to say.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He touched his chin as he contemplated.

Hui Ming saw that Qin Yu seemed tempted, so he struck while the iron was hot. “We didn’t touch this girl, and you didn’t lose anything. You can even get this holy medicine for a long period of time. Why not?”

Qin Yu nodded slowly. “I indeed didn’t lose anything...”

“That’s right!” Hui Ming nodded quickly.

“So Qin Yu, not only are we not enemies, but we might even become friends!”

Qin Yu raised his head and looked at Hui Ming. He sneered and said, “Become friends? Become friends with maggots like you? Then wouldn’t I also become a maggot?”

Hui Ming’s expression changed. He frowned and said, “Qin Yu, what do you mean?”

“You’re right. I indeed have nothing to lose,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“But the Earth Fiend Valley has done evil things. You’re unscrupulous. For the sake of your cultivation, you have harmed countless young girls and families!”

“I have detested the Earth Fiend Valley since long before!”

“Are you even worthy to be my friend?!”

His words were sonorous and powerful!

Hui Ming couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“To cultivators, the lives of these ordinary people are as insignificant as grass. Qin Yu, you’re going against the Earth Fiend Valley for a group of low-level people?” Hui Ming laughed so hard that he could barely breathe.

Qin Yu’s expression became even colder, and the murderous aura on his body became even stronger.

“I really don’t know where your sense of superiority comes from... to you, ordinary people are dirt, but to me, aren’t you the same?” Qin Yu said coldly.
