Chapter 844: Chapter 844, the Martial Saint had attacked again! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

This secret realm was not very big, so Qin Yu did not spend much time. Soon, he arrived at the location shown on the main road.

He scanned his surroundings and found that this place was indeed even more desolate.

Not to mention the trees, even the rocks had been weathered. It was like a desert.

Qin Yu squatted down and imitated the handlebar mustache. He slowly rubbed the ground and felt every inch of the ground.

This was a big project. Because it was extremely meticulous, if one was absent-minded for even a moment, they might not notice the abnormality, so it would take a long time.

At this moment, in a room on the side of the palace.

Wan Gu Qiong’s face was gloomy.

The two elders beside him did not say a word, waiting for Wan Gu Qiong’s order.

“Damn it! Let that Qin Yu go just like that!”Wan Gu Qiong gritted his teeth and said.

The old man beside him said, “How did this kid offend you to make you lose your temper?”

Wan Gu Qiong glanced at him and sighed, “I don’t have such a small tolerance. The reason why I wanted to kill him was because I felt a sense of danger from him.”

“A sense of danger?”The old man beside him could not help but feel a little surprised.

Wan Gu Qiong nodded and said, “Yes, if we let this kid step into the Martial Saint Realm, I’m afraid no one in our secret realm would be able to stop him!”

“And based on my understanding of him, he will definitely destroy the entire Wan family!”

The old man at the side could not help but laugh and said, “Young Master Wan, aren’t You worrying too much? The current era can no longer produce a martial saint. Don’t you know that?”

Wan Gu Qiong said coldly, “But there are rumors that he will break this deadlock.”

“Many people have already predicted that next year, the era where the martial saint does not appear will change.”

Once these words were said, the two martial saints still did not take it seriously.

“So what if he has become a martial saint? He is only a new martial saint. It is not difficult to kill him.”

Wan Gu Qiong shook his head and said, “No, this child is not normal.”

“When he has become a martial marquis, he was almost invincible in the Martial Marquis realm. Once he has become a martial saint, God knows what will happen.”

After hearing Wan Gu Qiong’s words, the two old men said, “If you want to kill him, there are many ways. So what if he, Le Xian, protects him? I don’t believe that he can send two martial saints to follow him at all times.”

Wan Gu Qiong frowned and said, “But... it’s not a wise choice to completely break with the Le family.”

“Young Master Wan, Le Xian doesn’t put the Wan family in his eyes. Why should we show him Mercy?”

“What’s more, he kuan, the Le family can’t have a falling out with the Wan family over a dead person, right?”

These words reminded Wan Gu Qiong.

He rubbed his chin and said in a low voice, “What you said makes sense! Immediately find Qin Yu’s location and kill him!”

“No problem.”The two martial saints nodded and then went to the palace.

However, after searching the palace, they did not find Qin Yu’s figure.

“HMPH, let’s see where you can run to.”One of the martial saints snorted coldly.

Before he had finished speaking, he released his spiritual sense and searched for Qin Yu’s figure.

As a martial saint, his spiritual sense was extremely powerful. It could almost cover the entire mystic realm!

Therefore, he quickly found Qin Yu’s location.

“There.”That old man stretched out his hand and pointed in a certain direction.

Wan Gu Qiong said coldly, “Let’s go and find him!”

...

At this moment, Qin Yu was still stroking the ground.

He slightly closed his eyes, feeling every inch of the ground’s abnormality.

Qin Yu was completely unaware that danger was approaching.

“HM?”

At this moment, Qin Yu’s brows raised.

A cold feeling came from his palm.

Qin Yu didn’t think too much and hurriedly stood up. His hand formed a golden light and smashed towards the ground.

“Boom!”

With a punch, dust rose up in the surroundings!

The ground suddenly sank into the ground!

A huge round plate suddenly appeared in front of Qin Yu!

The round plate was engraved with dense runes. Other than that, there were also a few pieces of paper that looked like seals on it!

“This is... a seal?”A trace of surprise flashed across Qin Yu’s face.

What exactly was this disc sealing?

Could It Be Yin Energy?

“Damn, it can’t be that it’s sealing some monster...”Qin Yu muttered softly.

If it was sealing a guardian that looked like two male corpses, then it would be troublesome.

At that time, everyone would probably die here.

“Damn it, I don’t Care!”Qin Yu gritted his teeth.

Who cares what it is? I’ll unseal it first!

“Qin Yu, you actually came here!”

At this moment, a voice came from behind Qin Yu.

He turned around and saw Wan Gu Qiong and the two martial saints looking at him coldly.

A bad premonition instantly flashed across Qin Yu’s heart.

“Wan Gu Qiong, what are you doing here?”Qin Yu pretended to be calm as he asked.

Wan Gu Qiong sneered and said, “Why? Didn’t Yue Xian send someone to follow you?”

Qin Yu remained silent as a trace of vigilance flashed across his face.

“Hahaha! I thought Yue Xian was really going to protect you. Why did he disappear after just one meeting?”Wan Gu Qiong sneered.

Qin Yu said coldly, “What on earth do you want to Do?”

“What do you want to Do? Of course, I want to kill you!”Wan Gu Qiong said with a cold expression.

At this moment, those two martial saints stepped forward!

Qin Yu inwardly cursed in his heart, and his expression instantly became extremely unsightly! Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Facing two martial saints, let alone winning, he didn’t even have the chance to fight back!

“Damn it!”Qin Yu cursed in his heart as he turned his head to look at the circular plate.

Just now, Qin Yu was still worried that there was some kind of monster sealed within this circular plate. At this moment, Qin Yu was hoping that there really was some terrifying existence sealed within!

Thinking of this, Qin Yu hurriedly threw a punch towards the disc!

“Boom!”

With a punch, the disc suddenly exploded!

Following that, a ray of light flew out from the disc and floated in mid-air!

At a glance, one could only see a golden core-like bead floating in the air.

Along with it, there was also a trace of yin qi.

“Damn it! It’s not a monster!”Qin Yu immediately felt that things were not good!

Wan Gu Qiong was also attracted by this pearl. He asked with some doubt, “What is this thing?”

“Young Master Wan, kill this kid first and then slowly study it,”a martial saint said.

“Okay, let’s do it!”Wan Gu Qiong said coldly.

That martial saint did not waste any more time and immediately rushed towards Qin Yu.
