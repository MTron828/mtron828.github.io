2401 News from Peach Blossom Island

This Celestial Saint’s enormous corpse’s energy of dead bodies entered his body. In about half a day, it had replenished almost half of his spiritual energy.

Qin Yu was a little dumbfounded. He had initially thought it would be good enough if the corpse could replenish 10% to 20%.

“Yao Xi’s corpse of Celestial Saint is also a Peak of Tribulation Fifth Level Supreme Elder, so the energy of dead bodies in his body is naturally terrifying.”

It was a pity that only the Yao family bloodline could communicate with these corpses. Otherwise, these two corpses would have provided enormous combat power. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Lei Xin sighed. Now he had to divert his attention to suppress the corpse of the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor, this was a hot potato.

“Dean Lei, release the corpse of the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor.”

Qin Yu took out the Coffin of Nine Lifetimes. This coffin had always been the nemesis of the soul.

“Will it work? The masked woman’s netherworld cultivation method is the nemesis of the soul, but her strength should still be much weaker than this corpse’s.”

Lei Xin felt it was not very reliable, but he still took out the Immortal Emperor’s corpse.

“Are you sure you want to try?”

Feeling worried, Lei Xin asked again, seeing Qin Yu’s anxious expression.

He removed the seal, and the corpse’s eyes immediately emitted a ferocious red light like a wild beast that was about to devour someone had awakened.

Qin Yu slammed his palm onto the corpse’s chest.

“Boom!”

A terrifying force exploded from the corpse, pushing Qin Yu’s arm away.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth as the veins on his hands bulged. He tried to suppress it with all his might.

However, the corpse released a magical force again. His body could not help but be sent flying into the air. The corpse shook violently, and a violent energy of dead bodies gushed out from the nostrils, ears, and even eyes of the corpse. After that, the energy of dead bodies exploded violently like the most powerful explosive.

“Boom!”

“How dare you! A corpse still dares to cause trouble!”

Lei Xin leaped up and another palm struck down from the other side.

“Quick, this corpse is going crazy without the Yao family’s control.”

Qin Yu controlled the Coffin of Nine Lifetimes and suddenly placed the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor’s corpse into it before closing the coffin.

In an instant, a deafening sound rang out from the Coffin of Nine Lifetimes, and a scream that made people’s scalps go numb came out of it. After that, the coffin slowly calmed down.

“Has he been suppressed it? It seems that we have underestimated the masked woman. The thing she left behind can even control the corpse of an Immortal Emperor. I don’t believe it if she doesn’t have extraordinary strength.”

Lei Xin looked surprised.

“Mmm, the masked woman of nine lifetimes, Teng Zixu, Si Shiyue, OImmortal Crane, Jun Yixian, and that monk who resisted many monsters, there are too many indescribable existences now.”

Qin Yu realized that now, there were many people he could not figure out their strengths.

“The Tribulation Transcending Stage is a real diving line. Everyone’s ultimate goal is to jump out of the Path of Heaven and become an Immortal Emperor. However, the Path of Heaven Immortal Emperor has not emerged for a long time. The cultivators nowadays are trying to create their own paths with all their might. Some are destined to soar to the sky, while others will fall to the ground.”

Lei Xin sighed and said to Qin Yu.

“Now that the golden age has completely descended, the Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivators from the ancient era should almost come out of seclusion soon. Previously, we were at the top. But once we encounter these cultivators from the ancient era, I’m afraid even if we have celestial artifacts, some people can’t deal with them. Now, other than the Ni family’s Supreme Elder who has already descended, the people of the other aristocratic families, including Thunder Courtyard, are summoning many patriarchs to return. We must stabilize the situation during this period. Once they break through, we no longer have to fear. I have a feeling that I’m also about to break through soon.”

Qin Yu nodded. Many people in the Holy Region had started to break through and were preparing to enter tribulation.

Almost everyone was racing against time. Moreover, according to the news from Thunder Courtyard, many ancient rogue cultivators had emerged and massacred some small sects.

The entire Holy Region was in chaos, and the news that came along was that the alien races in purgatory were wreaking havoc and massacred a large number of humans.

Originally, the various families had their elders in purgatory so they could still suppress them. However, after the Ni family’s incident, all the Supreme Elders had retreated to their families.

Moreover, the Si and the Yan families were about to break through, so they also summoned their elders of ancient times to their families to prevent others from launching sneak attacks.

“Qin Yu, I’ve just received news today that the Prince of Great Xia gave birth to a son on Peach Blossom Island.”

Peak Master Zhan Pu roared. In less than half a month, much of his hair had turned gray.

This time around, Demon-slaying Peak had lost about 30 people. He seemed to have aged a lot.

“The prince? When did he get married?”

At that time, the Prince of Great Xia helped him with many things, but in the end, he was imprisoned on Peach Blossom Island. He did not expect it to be nearly a hundred years since they last met.

“This prince is quite miserable. The people of the nine great aristocratic families were watching him and wanted him to give birth to an heir, but they didn’t expect him to have such a stubborn personality. However, he didn’t expect the nine great aristocratic families to add aphrodisiacs to his spiritual food and make him have sex with a woman. Once this child was born, his value would probably be squeezed dry.”

“D*mn it, these dogs are really beasts!”

Qin Yu fiercely crushed the spiritual essence in his hand, and his face revealed a furious expression.

He could not imagine how humiliating it was to be used as a mating tool. Moreover, after giving birth to his bloodline, they would snatch the bloodline away.

Zhan Pu was also furious, but there was nothing they could do now.

“Chang Mang, Jue Wu, do you dare to come with me and explore Peach Blossom Island?

“What am I afraid of? The heroic prince has helped us a lot before. If we don’t help with such a big matter, what are we cultivating for?”

Chang Mang said in a muffled voice.

Jue Wu jumped onto Qin Yu’s shoulder straight away and said a simple sentence.

“Let’s go!”

“No, the Prince of Great Xia is someone the nine great aristocratic families must control. Quite many Supreme Elders have returned to the Holy Region. I’m afraid you people will be in danger if you encounter these people.”

Zhan Pu stood in front of Qin Yu, not allowing them to go.

“Don’t worry, Peak Master, we won’t act rashly.”

Chang Mang patted his shoulder and guaranteed.

“Bullsh*t! How were you captured to the Skywater Prison the last time?” When Zhan Pu heard this boorish Chang Mang make his promise, he immediately pointed at him and cursed.

“Don’t worry, Peak Master, we promise to return safely.”

With a sharp thunderclap, Qin Yu grabbed the two of them and transformed into a bolt of lightning that disappeared in front of the peak master instantly.

“D*mn! Qin Yu, your speed is so fast.”

Chang Mang exclaimed.
