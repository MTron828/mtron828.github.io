Chapter 986: Chapter 986, Dilemma

Hearing this, Qin Yu hurriedly asked, “Do you know the Yan Family?”

Tie Dan said indifferently, “From your description, it can only be the Yan family that has been passed down for many years.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Continue.”

Tie Dan cleared his throat and said, “The Yan family is a family with an ancient heritage. It is said that their complete bloodline is extremely powerful. They were once considered as one of the most powerful bloodlines in the world.”

“According to my understanding, when the bloodline reaches 80% , they are qualified to become the head of the Yan family. 100% ... I have never seen it before.”

Qin Yu immediately frowned.

“80% ? That Yan Jinyao... seems to be 80% , but he was not taken away by the Yan family,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“That can only mean that he is not born with a bloodline,”tie Dan said with his hands spread out.

“There is a huge difference between a natural and acquired bloodline.”

“If he is born with 80% of a bloodline, the possibility of him entering the tribulation state in the future is very high. As for how strong he will be... no one knows.”

At this point, tie Dan could not help but sigh, “As I said, as long as the masked woman appears, it will definitely be a great era. Now it seems that this life is really a golden era.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything.

After hearing tie Dan’s words, Qin Yu felt a great pressure.

“Then is the Yan family very powerful?”Qin Yu continued to ask.

Tie Dan rolled his eyes at Qin Yu and said, “What do you think of the families that have crossed the Tribulation Stage?”

“Let me put it this way. As long as a family that has crossed the tribulation stage, it will be a top aristocratic family, and its descendants will benefit from it.”

“The bloodline of a tribulation-transcending realm cultivator flows in their body. Their descendants will be very strong.”

Qin Yu scratched his head and said, “Doesn’t the immortal slaying sect also have a tribulation-transcending realm? What about their descendants?”

“Are you F * cking bullshitting me? The immortal slaying sect was destroyed. Where did their descendants come from?”Tie Dan said somewhat speechlessly.

Qin Yu suddenly came to a realization and said somewhat embarrassedly, “I see...”

“Qin Yu, in such a big era, geniuses often appear. All kinds of bloodlines that have not been seen in ten thousand years will appear. You have to be careful,”tie Dan said with a yawn.

Qin Yu grunted and a trace of determination flashed in his eyes.

Although he felt that the pressure was a little heavy, he did not shrink back. Instead, it stimulated his fighting spirit.

The more this golden era was, the more exciting it was!

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He lay down on the bed and fell asleep. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The next day.

As soon as Qin Yu woke up, there was movement from downstairs.

He leaned on the window and saw two corpses being thrown at the door.

These two corpses looked the same as the previous few people. Their bodies were almost dried up.

Beside these two corpses, besides the onlookers, there was also the Purple Robe of the martial arts association of Jingdu.

“The martial arts association of Jingdu has finally sent someone,”Qin Yu said with his eyes narrowed as he rubbed his chin.

The purple robe downstairs was talking nonsense. He patted his chest and said, “Don’t worry. The Martial Arts Association of Jingdu will definitely give everyone an explanation for this matter!”

“Mr. Gu has already said that he will give us three days to catch the murderer!”

Qin Yu stood upstairs and couldn’t help but Snort coldly.

“I’m afraid these people are going to pull in the net,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Sure enough, when Qin Yu and the handlebar mustache went to the Elfy Society that afternoon, the people around him started to look at him strangely.

Their gazes were somewhat evasive, and some people even deliberately kept a distance from Qin Yu.

“Damn it, you believe it just like that?”The handlebar mustache couldn’t help but curse.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Like I said, three people become a tiger. No matter how fake a thing is, as long as you say it too much, it will become true.”

“Moreover, don’t forget that the mainstream media of martial arts is still in the hands of the martial arts association in Jingdu.”

The mustached man frowned and said, “Then what should we do?”

Qin Yu sighed slightly and shook his head. “It’s hard to get off a tiger. It’s a dilemma. There’s no way out.”

Everyone was just secretly suspecting that Qin Yu couldn’t just jump out and say that he didn’t do it, right?

Wasn’t that the same as admitting it without fighting?

“Ignore them.”Qin Yu shook his head.

On this day, Qin Yu could clearly feel the changes in the crowd around him.

According to Qin Yu’s calculation, at least 30% of the people were doubting him.

That night, Gu Xinghe could not help but laugh out loud.

“See? These people are just fence-sitters. Today’s hero may become a villain hated by Millions Tomorrow!”Gu Xinghe sneered.

He had long understood the hearts of the people.

“Young master Gu, do we need to release the word now?”Long eyebrows asked.

“No!”Gu Xinghe shook his head.

“If we want something to be real enough, we must not interfere directly. We must guide them from the side and let them suspect Qin Yu!”Gu Xinghe sneered.

Long Mei could not help but give Gu Xinghe a thumbs up.

“Young master Gu, I really did not expect you to have such talent! You are simply born with leadership skills!”Long Mei began to flatter.

Gu Xinghe also said with a slightly smug expression, “To deal with these people, I only need to use a little trick.”

“Qin Yu will soon understand that there are more than one way to kill people!”

Another Day passed.

The attitude of the people around Qin Yu changed again, and more and more people were afraid of Qin Yu.

Gu Xinghe even sent people to spread some seemingly rational “Analysis”among the crowd, trying to find ways to lead their suspicions to Qin Yu.

Three days later, no one dared to get close to Qin Yu.

As long as Qin Yu appeared, there would be people talking about him.

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered. He and the moustache man walked to a door, picked up a fan and asked, “Boss, how much is this?”

The Boss’expression changed, and he hurriedly said, “I... I’m not selling it.”

The mustached man said unhappily, “What? Are you saying that I won’t Give You Money?”

The owner was so scared that he didn’t say anything, and his face was even paler.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Forget it.”

After walking out of the shop, the mustached man couldn’t help but say, “Damn, these people are too much. A few days ago, they said that you were a hero, but in just a few days, your attitude has become like this.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “It’s not their fault that someone is guiding them.”

In the dark, someone looked at Qin Yu’s background and could not help but reveal a trace of a cold smile.

“Young Master Wan, do you have any thoughts?”A martial saint beside him asked.

Wan Gu Qiong sneered and said, “Others may not be able to see through Gu Xinghe’s methods, but I can see it clearly! In that case, I will help him!”

With that, he looked at the shop and said coldly, “Find an opportunity to kill the owner of this shop!”
