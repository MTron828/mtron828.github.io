2081 A Dozen True Saints Gather

Si Qianjing’s words perked up everyone.

They knew Si Qianjing’s intention. Although all the great aristocratic families had True Saints, they were all hiding. So far, none of them had burned their blood essence to resume their peak state.

If Si Qianjing burned his blood essence, it would mean that he would be breaking the current balance, and the aristocratic families would have to weigh the situation.

It would be troublesome if Si Qianjing took advantage of his remaining lifespan to kill everyone having a grudge against the Si family.

Even the nine great aristocratic families were unwilling to see such a deterring power.

Si Qianjing was silent, but a glint of ruthlessness flashed across his eyes.

At this moment, a large group of people suddenly descended from afar.

“Si Qianjing, long time no see!” A voice entered Si Qianjing’s ears.

Looking up, he saw an elderly man leading a large group of people to Dragon Burial Cave.

Si Qianjing frowned. He recognized this person. He was a True Saint of the Gu family, a Supreme Elder who had not appeared for many years!

Before Si Qianjing could feel shocked, the other aristocratic families also arrived.

In the blink of an eye, a dozen cultivators of the True Saints cultivation realm had appeared!

Besides the people sent by the nine great aristocratic families, many rouge cultivators had also arrived.

Si Qianjing’s brows furrowed even more. He knew that the news of Qin Yu possessing the Traceless Immortal Scripture would spread soon, but he did not expect it to be so fast!

“Si Qianjing, it seems that you didn’t gain anything in Dragon Burial Cave,” a True Saint said with a smile.

“Since you can’t get the Traceless Immortal Scripture, why don’t you let us do it?” another True Saint said.

“Cut the crap,” Si Qianjing said coldly. “Dragon Burial Cave is mysterious and unpredictable. You can’t use your spiritual power unless you’re in your peak state. If you’re capable, you can go in and try.”

“Hahaha, I think you’re just trying to scare us. You want to monopolize the Traceless Immortal Scripture!”

“It’s better to try than to listen to the hearsay. Let me take a look!”

After saying that, a True Saint’s body emitted a mysterious light that protected his body. Thereafter, he stepped into Dragon Burial Cave without looking back.

However, a few minutes later, the True Saint walked out.

His expression was solemn, and he did not say a word.

Facing Si Qianjing’s mockery, the True Saint did not get angry. He just shook his head and said, “Looks like you’re right. The rumors about this Dragon Burial Cave are very likely to be true.”

“Then how did Qin Yu survive in Dragon Burial Cave?” Some True Saints were not convinced and stepped into Dragon Burial Cave. However, they could not move forward just like Si Qianjing and the others.

In a mere half day, eight True Saints had entered Dragon Burial Cave. The outcomes were self-evident.

The True Saints were silent. After a while, someone said, “The Traceless Immortal Scripture has extraordinary significance. We can’t let this kid monopolize it. No matter what, we have to work together to get the Traceless Immortal Scripture.”

“That’s true. The Traceless Immortal Scripture is a supreme secret treasure. Qin Yu is not qualified to possess it.”

“Everyone, why don’t we join forces to enter this Dragon Burial Cave? After we obtain the Traceless Immortal Scripture, we can read it together.”

Everyone agreed to this suggestion. After all, they were all True Saints and had the same right to speak.

“Let’s think about how to enter this Dragon Burial Cave,” someone said.

Therefore, the group began to discuss countermeasures together.

In the Dragon Burial Cave, Qin Yu’s expression became increasingly unsightly.

He could clearly feel the terrifying pressure. This power was too terrifying as a dozen True Saints could almost destroy the entire Holy Region!

It had been a long time since such a power had appeared. For a moment, the people in the Holy Region were in a heated discussion.

“Have you heard of it? A dozen True Saints have gathered in the Dragon Burial Cave in Donghuang!”

“A dozen True Saints? Oh my god! There are so many True Saints in this world?”

“Rumor has it that they’re all trying to get the Traceless Immortal Scripture. The various aristocratic families have nearly gone all-out. They’re blocked outside the Dragon Burial Cave, and discussing the countermeasures now.”

“Hmph, a dozen True Saints can even destroy the Holy Region, let alone a Dragon Burial Cave! I’m afraid it’ll be very difficult for Qin Yu to stay alive.”

The entire Holy Region was shaken. Meanwhile, the True Saints sent by the Si family were still hunting down Xiao Hai and Jue Wu.

…

In a small city at the edge of Lizhou, a petite girl was wolfing down food in a restaurant.

She looked like she was in tremendous distress. Her body had many wounds, and her internal qi was also a little weak.

Her clothes were ragged, and she looked like a beggar on the roadside.

“Do you have money to pay?” the owner of the restaurant could not help but walk over and ask.

“F*ck you! I won’t owe you money!” The girl opened her mouth and cursed, looking fierce.

The restaurant owner had no choice but to walk to the side.

This girl was none other than Jue Wu.

At this moment, Jue Wu was in an incredibly sorry state. Without the secret technique that Dean Lei had personally imparted to her, she would have already become a corpse.

Just as Jue Wu was eating and drinking heartily, a terrifying internal qi suddenly descended, practically enveloping the entire city.

Jue Wu’s expression changed. She stood up abruptly and frowned.

“This old b*stard arrived pretty quickly…” Jue Wu gritted his teeth and could not help but whisper.

“Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!”

At this moment, the bodies of the surrounding cultivators suddenly exploded and turned into a cloud of blood mist!

In the blink of an eye, the city that bustled with activity just a moment ago became incomparably quiet.

There were corpses all around, and blood flowed like a river.

After that, an elderly man walked over.

His face was full of fatigue, his body hunched, and his eyes full of indescribable indifference and desolation. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“You old b*stard! What did they do to you?” Jue Wu could not help but be furious and fiercely slammed the table.

The elderly man put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “They’re just a bunch of ants. It doesn’t matter if they die. Moreover, they all died because of you.”

“Bullsh*t! I’ll kill you, old b*stard!” Jue Wu was furious and purple light emitted from her body as she charged at the elderly man!

However, the elderly man had his hands behind his back, and his expression was incredibly calm. Just as Jue Wu was about to get close, his body trembled slightly, and Jue Wu was instantly sent flying. She even spat out a mouthful of blood!

He was too powerful! The strength of True Saint was not something a Reversion Void Stage cultivator could compare to!

Jue Wu could not parry the attack at all with the difference in strength between the two.

“Next is your turn,” the True Saint said indifferently.

He slowly raised his hand and aimed it in Jue Wu’s direction as if he was about to activate some terrifying technique.
