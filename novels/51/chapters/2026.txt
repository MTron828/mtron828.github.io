2027 The Uneasy Si Shiyue

Although Qin Yu indeed nearly perished in this battle, he seemed to have comprehended something in this battle that he was on the brink of death.

Qin Yu shook his head hard and struggled to get up from the bed. Then he staggered out of the room.

It was a wooden house that stood on the water. It was quite huge and surrounded by water. The environment was beautiful.

The wooden house was built on a green lake, surrounded by dense green trees and exotic flowers. The fresh fragrance of flowers permeated the air.

!!

The lake water was like a mirror, reflecting the beautiful scenery of the surroundings.

Several egrets glided gracefully across the lake, leaving a series of ripples behind.

Not far away, there was a small mountain. The mountain forest was lush green.

Qin Yu felt unprecedented tranquility in this quiet environment.

The anxiety and uneasiness in his heart seemed to have dissipated in this beautiful scenery.

He closed his eyes and took a deep breath of fresh air. He integrated the comprehension he never had before into the depths of his soul. It was like connecting imminent death with the peace of life.

Following his gaze, he saw Xiao Hai sitting by the river and playing his flute.

The sound was melodious, and people were mesmerized by it. It was totally different from the seductive sound of the Saintess Gu.

“You’re awake,” Seeing Qin Yu walking out from the door, Xiao Hai put down the flute in his hand and asked with a smile.

Qin Yu walked up to Xiao Hai and sat down. He nodded slightly and said, “Mr. Xiao, how long have I been unconscious?”

“About eight days,” Xiao Hai said.

“What?” Upon hearing this, Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. He hurriedly stood up and wanted to leave.

But a gentle internal qi blocked Qin Yu’s way at this moment.

“Where are you going?” Xiao Hai asked.

“Jue Wu is still waiting for me,” said Qin Yu in a deep voice. “If I don’t go back, she will definitely overthink. Moreover, the Chaos Grave should open soon.”

Hearing what Qin Yu said, Xiao Hai said in surprise, “You’ve been together with Jue Wu?”

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded, but he did not have the time to explain. He turned around and was about to leave.

“With your current condition, it’s better for you to rest here. As for Jue Wu, tell me her location. I’ll go look for her,” Xiao Hai said.

Qin Yu frowned. It was not a bad idea to let Xiao Hai look for Jue Wu.

Xiao Hai had unfathomable strength and was a rare talent that was hard to find. It would be safe for Jue Wu to stay with him.

In other words, it was safe to let Xiao Hai bring Jue Wu here.

“But that Chaos Grave…” Qin Yu frowned.

Xiao Hai shook his head and said, “I’ve asked around. It’s tremendously difficult to open the Chaos Grave. Eighteen formation masters are opening it now. I’m afraid it will take some time. You should rest here for the time being.”

After hearing what Xiao Hai said, Qin Yu now understood the situation.

No wonder the Si family failed to find a brilliant formation master to break the formation.

“Your strength has indeed surprised me.” At this moment, Xiao Hai suddenly changed the topic.

“I’m just relying on the formation,” Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said.

“Relying on the formation?” Xiao Hai raised his eyebrows. Then he laughed heartily and said, “Qin Yu, don’t be so humble. That formation is not something that an ordinary person can set up. Moreover, you are betting your life on it. If you are not careful enough, you might die in this formation. However, you still chose to do so. I want to know why.”

Qin Yu was silent for a while, then sighed and said, “I had wanted to kill Elder Si to prevent him from taking revenge on you, but now it seems my plan failed.”

Xiao Hai was even more surprised. He frowned and said, “Why did you do that? For me? Is it worthwhile?”

“Is it worthwhile to offend the Si family for a street peddler you don’t know?” Qin Yu asked.

Xiao Hai was stunned for a moment before he burst into laughter.

He patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “I know you’re like me!”

“I don’t deserve your praise. Mr. Xiao has always been my role model,” Qin Yu bowed and said.

In Nanzhou, Xiao Hai was a famous selfless person and a true hero. His cultivation realm was probably even higher by now.

At this moment, Xiao Hai took out a pill and handed it to Qin Yu.

“What is this?” Qin Yu said in surprise.

“I’ve got you a pill,” Xiao Hai said. “Eat it.”

After saying this, Xiao Hai stood up and said, “It’s very safe here. Don’t worry and stay here. Tell me Jue Wu’s location, and I’ll look for her.”

Then Qin Yu gave Xiao Hai Jue Wu’s location. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Xiao Hai quickly set off without delay.

With a flash of his figure, he disappeared into the void.

Qin Yu looked around in surprise and muttered, “This is actually a Mystic Realm…”

…

At the same time, during the eight days Qin Yu was in a deep sleep, Qin Yu’s reputation had already resounded through more than half of the Holy Region.

The aristocratic families that had already gradually lost their attention on Qin Yu also resumed their attention to Qin Yu.

The Third Elder of the Si family was a Semi-Saint. He had learned many secret techniques of the Si family, and his strength was far beyond that of ordinary Semi-Saints. How could it be not shocking to be killed by Qin Yu?

Even though Qin Yu had relied on the formation, such a battle record was still incredibly eye-catching. It was not an exaggeration to say that not many people in the entire Holy Region could do it!

In the Si family, Si Shiyue heard the news when he just came out of closed-door cultivation.

Sitting alone by the pool, he looked gloomy. He was silent, and no one knew what he was thinking.

...

“Why? Are you feeling afraid now?” At this moment, Si Shiyue heard a voice.

He turned around and saw an elderly man.

Although this elderly man looked old, he was full of spirit. His every move seemed to be surrounded by dao techniques, and his strength was evident.

When Si Shiyue saw him, he quickly stood up and addressed him respectfully, “Master.”

This person was none other than Si Shiyue’s grandmaster, Si Liuhe.

Not only did he teach Si Shiyue all the techniques, but he also personally assisted him in his development!

It was no exaggeration to say that Si Liuhe had a very high status in the Si family. Even the head of the Si family respected him!

Si Liuhe waved his hand slightly, indicating for Si Shiyue to sit down. Then he said indifferently, “Did the appearance of another chaotic body make you panic?”

Si Shiyue opened his mouth, then shook his head and said, “No, Master.”

“Tell me the truth.” Si Liuhe put his hands behind his back and said indifferently.

Si Shiyue gritted his teeth, then said reluctantly, “I’m indeed a little panicked. We’re both chaotic bodies, so we’ll definitely be compared!

...

“This Qin Yu is merely a rogue cultivator, yet he has such outstanding battle achievements. I… I…” Si Shiyue opened his mouth but did not continue.

“I can see the uneasiness in your heart,” Si Liuhe said slowly.
