2351 Surging Killing Intent

“Qin Yu, we’re all in cultivation. Stop pretending to be kind. Choose your brother’s life or Ji Yue’s life.”

“I’ll give you three seconds to consider.” Ni Wuxiao calmed down and grabbed Chang Mang with one hand, his eyes revealing a cruel look.

Yao Xi looked somewhat anxious. He had thought that if they attacked with their full strength, they could quickly take down Qin Yu.

He did not expect Qin Yu to be not at a disadvantage at all with his fourth-grade True Saint strength.

If this dragged on, the other aristocratic families would notice, and their plans would fail.

“Looks like you’re choosing Ji Yue’s life, aren’t you?”

A cruel smile appeared on Yao Xi’s face as he yanked one of Chang Mang’s hands.

“Kill them, Qin Yu.”

Chang Mang spat a mouthful of blood as he roared at Qin Yu.

“You little scoundrel, you keep calling him your brother, yet you’re here bickering over a woman. You even dare to say you want to be with Saintess Yan. It’s really not worth it for Saintess Yan.”

Ni Wuxiao knew he could not waste time, so he grabbed Chang Mang’s other hand.

He crushed his entire fist, and as if he wanted Qin Yu to see clearly, he slowed down the action tremendously.

“You’re courting death, you two b*stards!”

Qin Yu was furious, and the internal qi on his body soared.

Suo Lin’s boxing glove on his left hand turned bright red. He came to the front of the two Ni family members.

He placed one hand on a person’s shoulder, and terrifying heat instantly surged on Suo Lin.

In an instant, that cultivator turned into a puddle of blood, and the treasures on the ground melted into liquid.

The cultivator could not even scream. After that, a giant fire dragon rushed out of Suo Lin.

The moment the fire dragon appeared, it let out a heaven-shaking roar.

The spiritual energy that bombarded the fire dragon’s body was like a tickle. Then, he was swept up by the fire dragon’s enormous body and turned into charcoal in a breath.

“Try making a move again. None of the people here can escape.”

He was no longer required to conserve his chaotic qi and could unleash Suo Lin’s to its full power.

All these people were nurtured using massive resources, and not only were they loyal to the family, but they also possessed formidable strength.

He did not expect Qin Yu to kill them instantly with one move. He also could not understand why Qin Yu’s strength had become so terrifying. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“We must suppress him directly. We can’t get Ji Yue through negotiation!”

Ni Wuxiao revealed a terrifying expression.

“Take him down with all your might. For the Xuanyuan Sword, it’s worth it even if you have to pay a huge price.” The internal qi on Yao Xi’s body skyrocketed as he prepared to attack with all her might.

“Sword, come forth! The Non-immortal Magic Sword.”

An inconspicuous magic sword appeared in Ni Wuxiao’s hand. The surface of the sword was covered with bronze scars.

The moment the sword appeared, Qin Yu felt an extreme sense of danger.

The Non-immortal Sword was the supreme treasure of the Ni family. The previous Holy Lord of the Ni family had once killed a cultivator at the Peak of Tribulation Transcending with this sword. After that, this sword had never been sealed in the Ni family.

This sword had never appeared in the past few years, but it was brought here by Ni Wuxiao this time.

There seemed to be some terrifying power sealed in that small sword.

Ni Wuxiao gently struck the Non-immortal Sword with his fingers, and suddenly, the sword burst into a brilliant radiance.

He held the Non-immortal Sword in his hand and stepped into the air before slashing it down directly.

The air rippled like water, and a surge of simple and ancient internal qi emanated from the sword’s body.

It was the killing intent on the battlefield. The massive killing intent turned into sword energy and slashed at Qin Yu.

That killing intent seemed to want to wipe out everything.

During the turbulent times, countless battles would condense into terrifying killing intent.

Qin Yu only felt like he was in a world of slaughter where the killing intent surged like rolling wheels, threatening to crush him into meat paste.

From Yao Xi’s end, he took out a white jade-like coffin.

As he chanted the incantation, the coffin slowly opened.

A corpse slowly floated up and hovered behind Yao Xi.

It was the corpse of a Celestial Saint from the Yao family. After he died, he forcefully sealed a wisp of his divine sense in his body.

In an instant, Yao Xi’s pupils turned pitch-black, and an internal qi not belonging to him emanated from his body.

He stepped forward, and the glass shattering sounded in the entire space. It was the sound of him collapsing the space.

He came to Qin Yu’s back and lightly punched out.

The two attacks arrived almost simultaneously.

A casual attack was already at the Peak of True Saint.

“D*mn it, these two are going all out!”

Qin Yu dared not be negligent. He surrounded himself with the Spiritualization Technique and Suo Lin’s shield to block the attack.

Previously, his power of divine sense had already broken through to the Peak of True Saint, and it contained the heavenly might.

And his glazed holy bone had already condensed his spiritual energy to the extreme. Although it was not yet complete, it had reached its peak.

Although he did not undergo the baptism of the power of rules, he broke through this constraint in another way.

Yao Xi raised his fist again. The Saint behind him also raised his fist. In an instant, lightning erupted around his fist. The lightning surrounded his fist, and a terrifying aura soared into the sky.

The heavenly might! This force blasted toward Qin Yu with unparalleled power.

The seal on Ni Wuxiao’s Non-immortal Sword was completely removed.

Countless battle images turned from illusion to reality, slashing down directly on Qin Yu’s head.

In an instant, Qin Yu felt like he was in a massacre on the battlefield. That killing intent crashed into him like a long river.

The remaining cultivators all flashed with spiritual energy in their hands.

However, they were not attacking Qin Yu. Instead, they continuously sent spiritual energy into the formation to conceal the internal qi at this place so that others would not detect it.

Before the two attacks could land on Qin Yu’s body, the terrifying internal qi had caused countless bloody wounds to appear on his skin and muscles.

And then they broke piece by piece. It was the most formidable attack under the current Path of Heaven.

Even though he had condensed the half-step Glazed Holy Body, his heart still palpitated with fear.

“Qin Yu, you f*cking die!”

The fist landed without reservation, and Yao Xi laughed maniacally.

This was the first time he felt such power. It was the power of the heavens.

These two attacks were already the most formidable power under the current Path of Heaven. If they were even a little stronger, they would suffer the backlash of the Path of Heaven.

This was the rule of heaven and could not be disobeyed.

A vast amount of pale yellow light appeared on Qin Yu’s body, and countless Sumeru qi slowly appeared on his body.

A vast amount of Sumeru qi surged out of Qin Yu’s Sumeru ring, forming a small spatial phantom.

That was the appearance of the Sumeru World, and the precious Sumeru qi was shuttling through it.
