Chapter 1555: Chapter 1555, Iron Gate Crack! 1

The old man nodded slightly and said, “That’s right. If you want to open this dungeon, you can only find Zhong Wu.”

“Then where is he now?”Qin Yu said with a cold face.

The old man smiled and said, “Zhong Wu isn’t here. I’m afraid you’ll have to wait for two or three days.”

“Two or three days?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but be silent for a moment.

It was not that he could not wait. It was just that looking at Jing Bai and Guan Zhuang below, Qin Yu could not bear it.

But there was no other way at the moment. Qin Yu could only nod and say, “Alright, then I’ll just wait for two or three days.”

Following that, Qin Yu lay on the door of the dungeon and shouted to the people below, “Jing Bai, Guan Zhuang, wait for me for two or three days. Believe me, Zhong Wu will definitely die soon.”

Jing Bai wanted to persuade him, but Qin Yu didn’t give him a chance. He turned around and left.

These hunters couldn’t afford to offend Qin Yu. They also knew that Qin Yu came to kill Zhongwu, so they treated Qin Yu with respect.

The group found a good place for Qin Yu to stay and brought Qin Yu the meat of the demonic beast.

After Qin Yu left the dungeon, the old man’s face instantly darkened.

He narrowed his eyes and looked coldly in the direction of the dungeon.

He slowly walked to the front of the dungeon and said in a low voice, “How terrifying... if he punches again, the door of this dungeon will definitely be broken...”

......

A very fine crack appeared on the door of the dungeon. It was almost invisible to the naked eye, and Qin Yu did not notice it.

The old man stared at the tiny crack and felt a lingering fear.

This dungeon had indeed imprisoned many extremely ferocious demonic beast, but there had never been any problems.

He did not expect that today, Qin Yu’s punch would create a crack! He did not dare to imagine what kind of Power Qin Yu’s punch contained!

“Zhong Wu, you’d better take care of things...”the old man whispered.

...

In the room.

Qin Yu didn’t notice the old man’s thoughts.

After all, Qin Yu didn’t have a precise grasp of his own strength.

Besides fighting Sima Bei, Qin Yu hadn’t encountered any big battles!

Even the deputy sect master, First Elder, and the others weren’t enough to be Qin Yu’s opponents.

“Zhong Wu, you’d better hurry back...”Qin Yu thought in his heart.

He restrained his internal Qi and suppressed his realm to the nascent soul realm.

In this way, Qin Yu had the opportunity to directly kill Zhong Wu!

“In the entire hunter organization, no one seems to know that I have stepped into the mighty realm. To me, this is not bad news,”Qin Yu thought in his heart.

Zhong Wu was not smart. Other than scheming, he did not have much potential.

It was shocking that such a person could become the leader of the Hunter organization.

“Two to three days... I can use these few days to study that divine body,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

This was one of the strongest physiques he had ever seen. Other than the holy body given to Jiang Gu, Qin Yu had never seen such a strong physique.

“I wonder who is stronger, the divine body or the chaotic body.”Qin Yu looked forward to it even more.

He was not sleepy at all. He immediately took out the bronze coffin and carefully examined the corpse.

On the other side.

Zhong Wu did not return in two or three days as the old man had said. He returned to the hunter organization the next morning.

The old man had been waiting for Zhong Wu on the way back. When he saw Zhong Wu, the old man quickly walked over.

“Team leader.”The old man walked forward and shouted.

Zhong wu nodded and said, “Why are you here?”

The old man said with a sullen face, “Qin Yu came, and he tried to take Jing Bai and the others away.”

As soon as he said this, Zhong Wu was stunned at first, then he burst into laughter.

“Is he looking for death? I was just about to kill him, but he came to me!”Zhong wu sneered.

The old man shook his head and said, “Team leader, you’d better not underestimate Qin Yu. His ability is probably beyond your imagination.”

Zhong wu sneered, “I know that Qin Yu has some ability, but in front of my white bone club, no one is worth mentioning!”

The old man knew that he couldn’t persuade Zhong Wu, so he didn’t waste his breath.

He looked at zhong wu and said, “Team leader, come with me.”

“Where to?”Zhong Wu said with some doubt.

The old man said in a deep voice, “I’ll take you to see the dungeon. You’ll understand everything.”

Then, the old man took the lead and walked in the direction of the dungeon.

The two people came to the direction of the dungeon. The old man walked to the Iron Gate and slowly squatted down.

“Team leader, look.”The old man pointed at the crack and said.

Because the crack was too fine, Zhong Wu didn’t find anything unusual. Instead, he frowned and said, “What are you looking at?”

The old man pointed at the crack and said, “Look carefully.”

Zhong Wu squatted down and looked at the iron gate.

He saw a crack on the iron gate.

“What... What’s going on?”Zhong Wu’s face couldn’t help but change.

The old man said, “This was smashed by Qin Yu Last Night.”

“How is that possible!”Zhong Wu was instantly shocked!

“This iron gate has imprisoned countless ferocious demonic beasts. Even when they are in a frenzy, they are unable to shake this iron gate. Could it be that Qin Yu is more terrifying than a demonic beast!”Zhong wu stared with his eyes wide open.

The old man sighed, “I don’t want to believe it either, but this is the truth. I saw it with my own eyes.”

When Zhong Wu saw this, a grave expression flashed across his face.

He tried to smash the iron door with the white bone club, but in the end, he failed. Not even a white mark was left.

Now, Qin Yu had used his fist to smash the iron door. This was simply shocking!

“Team leader, you’d better think of a way,”the old man said.

Zhong Wu’s expression was gloomy and uncertain. No one knew what he was thinking.

A moment later, the corner of Zhong Wu’s mouth curled up into a sneer.

He suddenly stretched out his hand and slapped the old man’s head!

This slap immediately knocked the old man unconscious!

The old man didn’t even have time to react before he fell into a coma.

Then, Zhong Wu dragged the old man’s body and walked toward the hunter organization.

When the hunters saw Zhong Wu, their expressions became somewhat unnatural.

They all walked forward and greeted, “Team leader, you’re back.”

Zhong Wu did not waste any time and immediately said, “Where’s Qin Yu? where is he?”

The expressions of these hunters changed slightly. They did not dare to hide and immediately pointed to Qin Yu’s room.

“There’s no need to look. I’m right here.”

At this moment, Qin Yu took the initiative to walk out. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Their eyes met, and their swords were drawn!

Their gazes seemed to be about to spark!

Just as everyone was guessing how the battle would start, Zhong Wu changed his smile and walked towards Qin Yu.
