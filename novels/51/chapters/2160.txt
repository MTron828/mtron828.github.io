2161 Leaving the Holy Region?

The warship looked somewhat old, but its construction was exquisite.

It was huge, a few hundred meters long, and the entire hull was made of black metal. This metal emitted a steady and ancient internal qi as if it had witnessed countless changes in the passing years.

The surface of the warship was covered with various complicated runes. These runes flickered with a faint light under the sunlight as if a mysterious power was flowing within them. The arrangement of these runes was disordered. Some were dense, some were sparse, but each seemed to be telling an ancient and mysterious story.

There were many deep wounds on the hull of the warship. These wounds looked very old as if they had existed for a long time.

Every wound was like a scar, bearing witness to the countless battles and storms that the warship had experienced.

Although these wounds were old, they did not affect the warship’s aura. Instead, it made the warship look even more indestructible and filled with boundless power.

A huge word, “Lei”, was on the warship’s bow. This word looked very ancient as if it had existed for countless years. It shined with a metallic luster under the sun, emitting a domineering internal qi as if announcing to the world the power of this warship.

Dean Lei gazed at the gigantic warship with yearning in his eyes.

After a while, Dean Lei slowly opened his mouth and said, “This warship once accompanied our ancestors to travel the starry sky and experienced countless battles, big and small. Every wound is a testimony of our former glory!”

“Dean Lei, are you referring to Immortal Emperor Lei?” Qin Yu asked in surprise.

“That’s right.” Dean Lei’s tone carried a hint of pride.

“This warship has been sealed for a few thousand years. I thought it would retire, and I didn’t expect it to be put to use again today.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Hearing this, a trace of respect instantly rose in Qin Yu’s heart.

It was a warship that had accompanied the Immortal Emperor through countless experiences! Although it was only a warship on the growth path of the Immortal Emperor, it still had an indescribable significance!

The fact that Dean Lei was willing to give this item to Qin Yu was undoubtedly a sign of his high trust and expectations for him. This warship was not only a means of transportation but also a symbol. It symbolized the glory and history of Immortal Emperor Lei and the trust and expectation of Thunder Courtyard.

Qin Yu looked at Dean Lei deeply, bowed deeply toward him, and said, “Dean Lei, I will treasure this warship. I will let it witness glory once again.”

“I believe you can do it. I hope the next time I see you, you’re invincible in the world,” Dean Lei said with a slightly gratifying expression.

Qin Yu’s gaze exuded an unwavering determination. He nodded hard and said, “Definitely.”

There were only two ways to activate this warship. One was to use the spiritual energy in the body or a kind of fuel for the warship.

This fuel was called the Void Crystal. It was an extremely rare material that contained powerful spiritual energy and could provide enough power for the warship.

Dean Lei brought Qin Yu onto the warship and then brought Qin Yu to tour its interior.

It could be said that there was nothing on the warship. It almost had no facilities. Other than a massive cultivation space, there was nothing else.

The entire warship was different from what he had imagined. To an existence like Immortal Emperor Lei, he naturally did not care about appearances. It seemed that everything was for cultivation.

Dean Lei pointed to a room not far away and said, “There’s also a huge activation formation inside. Use that formation to navigate this warship. As for the remaining Void Crystal, it should be able to last until you find a new one.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. He glanced around and saw countless traces left in the cultivation room.

These traces seemed to come from the activities of Immortal Emperor Lei. Every trace bore witness to the past of his cultivation.

Qin Yu sniffed hard and whispered, “On this battleship, I can even smell an internal qi similar to the immortal grave of Lei Ming.”

The air inside the warship seemed to be full of the internal qi of Immortal Emperor Lei. This internal qi was profound and ancient as if it contained endless wisdom and power.

Qin Yu could feel that this internal qi was not a simple spiritual energy fluctuation but a sense of existence coming from the depths of life. This was the unique mark that Immortal Emperor Lei left on this warship.

There were many deep sword scars on the walls of the cultivation room. These sword scars penetrated deeply into the walls, and each seemed to tell the story of a battle. These sword scars had different shapes, some were wide and powerful, and some were as thin as silk. However, they were all filled with a unique sense of power. It was as if each sword scar was cultivation or battle of Immortal Emperor Lei.

A massive stone platform was in the center of the cultivation room. The stone platform was covered with various kinds of complicated runes. These runes flickered with a faint light under the sun as if a mysterious power was flowing within them. This stone platform was clearly where Immortal Emperor Lei cultivated. Judging from the powerful internal qi emitting from the stone platform, Immortal Emperor Lei’s cultivation here was definitely not ordinary.

Besides the cultivation room, the other parts of the warship also had traces of Immortal Emperor Lei. In a corner of the cabin, there was a small bookshelf with some ancient books on it. These books were all books that Immortal Emperor Lei had read before, each full of traces of history.

A small alchemy room was on the other side of the warship. All kinds of alchemy tools filled the interior of the room. Immortal Emperor Lei had once used these tools, and each was full of his internal qi.

However, it was obvious that all these tools and books had been abandoned and left only for observation.

Qin Yu stretched out his hand, wanting to feel something from it, but failed in the end.

Dean Lei, at the side, said indifferently, “Don’t be greedy. The valuable things on this ship have already been taken away.”

Qin Yu was slightly embarrassed. He retracted his gaze and bowed to Dean Lei to express his gratitude.

He looked up at the sky. It was already dark, and there were even specks of stars.

“I should be leaving now,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

At this point, Qin Yu looked at Dean Lei and said, “Can you do me another favor?”

Without even thinking about it, Dean Lei nodded and said, “Just say it, and I won’t reject it if I can do it.”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment before saying, “I want you to help me find a coordinate.”

“Coordinate? The place where you came from?” Dean Lei guessed Qin Yu’s thoughts.
