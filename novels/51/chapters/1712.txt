Chapter 1713: Did He Teng See through It? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Li Cheng rushed to North Plain in the dark during nighttime and self-destructed to eliminate Yuan Xiu.

This news was not only spread across the northern border, but soon it also spread in the entire Nanzhou.

“Senior Li Cheng…” Instantly, countless people at the northern border were extremely sad.

Li Cheng’s actions were undoubtedly similar to Xiao Hai’s back then. He thought of using the same method to prevent disaster.

At the northern border, many people looked toward North Plain with complicated expressions.

Their eyes were filled with both pain and anger.

When this news spread, many people from Nanzhou came over. They wanted to help Nanzhou.

Both Yong Ji and Sima Bei were severely injured and were on the verge of death. Not to mention fighting, even moving was difficult. Whether they could survive or not remained unknown.

As such, it was difficult to determine the winning and losing parties in the battle at the northern border.

At North Plain.

Sima Bei and Yong Ji lay half-dead on the bed, especially Yong Ji. He was lying there motionlessly.

Sima Bei used all his might to look at He Teng and said in a trembling voice, “He Teng… must defend the snowy mountain…”

He Teng’s face revealed a weird smile with an extreme sense of responsibility.

He said indifferently, “Alright, I’ll definitely guard the snowy mountain well.”

After saying this, He Teng turned around and walked out.

He took a deep breath and looked at the sky full of white snow. For a moment, he couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“Finally, I have a chance.” He Teng sneered repeatedly.

His purpose in coming to North Plain was to find the inheritance of the Immortal Slaying Sect.

But all this while, due to Sima Bei’s existence, his movements had been extremely restricted.

Now that Sima Bei was severely injured, who in the entire North Plain could stop He Teng?

Without further ado, He Teng immediately began to carry out his plan.

At this moment, Qin Yu was still absorbing the dark energy from North Plain.

In just a few days, Qin Yu realized that the dark energy in his body had saturated. Even if he continued, his strength couldn’t advance even the slightest.

“It’s about time to leave,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Now, he should find a place to try to break through and step into the Advanced-stage of the mighty realm.

After that, he would rely on the dragon blood to continue cultivating.

After a simple pack-up, Qin Yu planned to leave North Plain.

“Where do you plan to go?”

At this moment, a voice came from the back of Qin Yu.

Qin Yu instantly tensed up, and his expression was also somewhat unsightly.

This voice was none other than He Teng’s voice!

“This b*stard…” Qin Yu could not help but secretly gritted his teeth.

He forcefully suppressed the anger in his heart and said, “I… I want to find a place to rest for a while.”

“Oh? To rest?” He Teng’s brows pricked up. “Then why are you here? Why are you hiding in this desolate place by yourself?”

Qin Yu opened his mouth, for a moment he did not know how to answer.

“I… I was startled by the commotion yesterday. I was curious and came here to see. Please forgive me, Godly King,” said Qin Yu bracing himself.

“Hahaha!”

Hearing this, He Teng burst into laughter.

“How did you address me?” He Teng said with narrowed eyes.

Qin Yu was stunned and said, “Godly… Lord Godly King…”

Hearing this, He Teng instantly laughed even more happily.

He pointed at Qin Yu and laughed maniacally, “You actually addreded me as Godly King? And Lord? Hahaha!”

Qin Yu frowned as his heart was filled with doubt.

Did he address him wrongly? Was this He Teng not Godly King of North Plain at all?

“Call me Lord then from now on, Qin Yu.”

Just as Qin Yu was puzzled, He Teng’s words caused Qin Yu’s expression to change drastically!

Indeed, He Teng had long discovered Qin Yu’s identity!

Since that was the case, there was no need for Qin Yu to continue disguising himself.

He quietly mobilized the internal qi in his body and then looked coldly at He Teng.

“You indeed discovered it long ago,” Qin Yu said coldly.

He Teng narrowed his eyes and said, “Did you think I couldn’t recognize you after you changed your appearance?”

Qin Yu said with a cold face, “If that’s the case, why didn’t you expose me earlier?”

Hearing this, a faint smile appeared on He Teng’s face.

He put his hands behind his back and said, “I told you that your body could only be mine. I don’t want you to die in North Plain and let Yuan Xiu take over your body.”

“Are you that interested in my body?” Qin Yu frowned.

He Teng said indifferently, “Chaotic body. Who isn’t interested?”

“Since that’s the case, I won’t talk any more nonsense with you,” Qin Yu said.

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and was about to leave.

“Stop.”

At this moment, He Teng’s figure flashed and appeared in front of Qin Yu.

He blocked Qin Yu’s way and said sinisterly, “I don’t plan to kill you for the time being, but I’m still very interested in torturing you…”

As he spoke, his body emitted an icy chill that was even colder than the coldness of North Plain.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “He Teng, do you think you’re my match? Other than Sima Bei and Yong Ji, who else in North Plain can stop me?”

He Teng laughed loudly and said, “If we were on the other side, I might not be your match. But don’t forget, this is North Plain! From the moment you stepped into North Plain, you couldn’t even display 30% of your strength. How can you be my match?” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes, sneered, and said, “Is that so?”

As he spoke, an extremely intense internal qi erupted from Qin Yu’s body!

His body was bathed in golden light as if it was the first ray of sunlight in the frozen snow. It was extremely dazzling!

He Teng’s expression could not help but change slightly as he exclaimed, “You’re not impacted?”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “If you don’t use the White Bone Club, even in North Plain, you’re not my match.”

He Teng sighed slightly and said, “I’m getting even more interested in your body now.”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Do you still want to fight?”

He Teng said indifferently, “I’ll let you off for now.”

Qin Yu snorted coldly. He was too lazy to talk nonsense with He Teng. After all, this was not the place to talk.

After that, Qin Yu did not dare to stay any longer and quickly left North Plain.

When Qin Yu returned to the northern border, everyone was surrounding Hu Xing and discussing countermeasures.

“I heard that Sima Bei and Yong Ji are both severely injured and can’t even move now,” someone beside him said.

“So?”

“So? There are only two people at the Reversion Void Stage in North Plain. Now that both of them are severely injured, this is an opportunity for us,” Hu Xing snorted coldly and said.

“If someone at the Reversion Void Stage simply enters North Plain, who can stop him? We can then just kill Yuan Xiu who has not recovered,” Hu Xing said coldly.

Hearing this, everyone immediately came back to their senses.

That was right. Without a Reversion Void Stage cultivator, who could stop a Reversion Void Stage cultivator from Nanzhou? In that case, wouldn’t the problem be solved?
