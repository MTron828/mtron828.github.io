Chapter 1489: Chapter 1,489, absolute dance vs Eternal Dance 1

“These bastards...”eternal dance’s expression turned even colder.

The black-robed man had said that he would send the elite soldiers of the northern lands to assist him.

But how were these people elite soldiers? They were a bunch of trash!

The current eternal dance was truly in a dilemma.

He took a deep breath and stepped forward.

Just as Jue Wu’s palm was about to land on someone else, Yong Ji suddenly raised his hand and collided with Jue Wu’s small palm.

Boom

A terrifying internal Qi rippled out in all directions.

The entire Hua Ning mountain trembled slightly as countless rocks fell down.

Jue Wu and Yong Ji both took two steps back.

“Damn it...”this made Yong Ji extremely angry.

This palm seemed to be evenly matched, but in reality, Yong Ji had used almost all of his strength!

What made Yong Ji even more shocked was that he couldn’t use too many spells!

Because once he used a spell, his identity would be discovered!

“Whoosh!”

Just as Yong Ji was in a daze, Jue Wu had already rushed over like a hungry wolf pouncing on its prey!

Along with Jue Wu’s fury, her strength seemed to have increased as well.

Her hands were stained with a blood-red radiance. This radiance was extremely eye-piercing, like fresh blood!

Yong Ji did not dare to be negligent. He immediately let out an angry roar, his veins bulging as he raised his hand to welcome her.

“Clang!”

Another violent tremor! The entire Hua Ning mountain hummed!

Before Yong Ji could react, absolute dance had already pounced over once again!

Her hands were waving without any form of discipline, relying on her dense spiritual power!

For a moment, Yong Ji was in an extremely sorry state as he was forced to retreat!

This made Yong Ji even more alarmed. He suddenly realized that absolute dance’s strength was even stronger than he had imagined!

Such a huge commotion naturally attracted the attention of Qin Yu and Wen Dawen.

Qin Yu stood up and activated his desolate God’s eye, looking at the battlefield.

The battlefield was burning with flesh and blood flying everywhere.

The world seemed to be collapsing as all the laws were revealed at this moment.

“Ah! ! !”

With a roar, Yong Ji’s hands transformed into a dao technique as he used all his strength to slap at absolute dance.

Internal Qi surged from absolute dance’s body. With a shake of her hands, an internal Qi that was like a strong wind erupted from her hands.

“Boom!”

The collision of the two techniques caused the mountain barrier of Hua Ning to completely collapse!

Yong Ji was forced back a few steps, and his throat became even sweeter!

Yong Ji’s expression was extremely unsightly. He looked coldly at Jue Wu, and for a moment, there was some fear in his heart.

“Damn it... if I could use a spell, I definitely wouldn’t lose to her!”Yong Ji roared in his heart!

If this continued, he was afraid that he would really lose to Jue Wu today!

“Boom!”

Just as Yong Ji was thinking, Jue Wu suddenly arrived, and slapped Yong Ji’s chest.

Yong Ji instantly felt pain and retreated. He spat out a mouthful of blood and his chest caved in!

“No, I have to retreat.”Yong Ji’s expression turned cold. He didn’t care about his injuries and turned around to leave.

In the next second, Yong Ji hid in space and planned to leave.

But at this moment, a large scarlet hand suddenly appeared and slapped him out of the Void!

Yong Ji fell out of the Void, blood flowing out of his mouth.

“F * ck!”Yong Ji was furious. He even wanted to tear off his mask and fight with absolute dance!

However, his rationality overcame his impulsiveness in the end. He did not dare to waste any more time and quickly left.

Absolute dance originally wanted to chase after him, but she was afraid that she would fall into the enemy’s trap. She could only watch as he left.

After that, the internal Qi on Jue Wu’s body began to disappear, and everything returned to normal.

“Aunt Jue Wu, are you alright?”Wen Da hurriedly ran over.

Jue Wu snorted and said, “Of course I’m fine. These little shrimps dare to intrude into My Hua Ning Mountain. They really don’t know what’s good for them.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

After saying that, Jue Wu acted as if nothing had happened. She pulled Wen Da and Wen er and said, “Let’s go, let’s go. Hurry up and have a drink with me!”

On the other side, Yong Ji returned to Yongji City that night.

He hid in his room, tore off his clothes, and then looked at his chest.

There was a scarlet palm print on his chest.

And this palm print was still jumping with light.

“Damn it...”Yong Ji couldn’t help but clench his teeth.

He tried to force it out with spirit qi, but found it was useless.

Even though he was sweating from exhaustion, he couldn’t make the bloody palm print disappear.

“What the hell is this spell!”Yong Ji roared angrily!

At this moment, Yong Ji suddenly realized that the palm print seemed to be invading his body!

This made Yong Ji feel extremely uneasy. He lowered his head and looked at his chest. Then, he gritted his teeth and tore off the lump of flesh on his chest!

Blood gushed out like a fountain.

Yongji endured the pain and looked at his own chest.

Fortunately, the palm print had disappeared.

His face was somewhat cold as he sat there and allowed the blood to flow out.

“Looks like I underestimated the final dance.”Yongji took a deep breath.

He originally thought that he would be able to easily take down the final dance, but he did not expect to return in defeat. He even nearly lost his life.

At this moment, the black-robed man suddenly walked in.

When he saw the black-robed man, a trace of anger flashed across Yong Ji’s face.

“It seems that Mister Yong Ji did not make a good start.”The black-robed man said with a smile that was not a smile.

Yong Ji looked at the black-robed man coldly and said, “Are you all useless in the north? The people you sent out don’t even have the ability to resist. Why? Are you playing with me in the North?”

The black-robed man was not panicking. He said indifferently, “Mr. Yong Ji, we are also here to see your ability.”

“See my ability?”A powerful internal Qi immediately erupted from Yong Ji’s body!

The enormous pressure directly pressed the black-robed man to the ground and he could not move!

“Are you courting death?”Yong Ji looked at the black-robed man in front of him coldly.

The black-robed man struggled with all his might, but he found that he could not break free at all!

“Mister... Mister Yong Ji, please don’t misunderstand. We have no ill intentions...”the black-robed man said with some panic.

“No ill intentions? I’m going to Mount Hua Ning and I can’t use magic. You should be clear about this, right?”Yong Ji said coldly.

“Are you planning to let me die on Mount Hua Ning and invade My Yong Ji City?”

As he spoke, Yong Ji stood up and raised his foot to step on the black-robed man’s body.

The black-robed man’s expression changed drastically. He hurriedly said, “Mr. Yong Ji, this... This is a mistake in our decision. I... I promise to compensate you. Please forgive me, Mr. Yong Ji...”

“Oh? Compensate me?”Yong Ji could not help but sneer. “What are you going to compensate me with?”

“Sacred Heart technique, we are willing to give you the complete Sacred Heart Technique!”The black-robed man hurriedly said.

Hearing this, Yong Ji’s expression eased up slightly.

He released the black-robed man and coldly said, “Then hand over the Sacred Heart Technique.”
