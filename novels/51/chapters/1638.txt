Chapter 1639: Chapter 1,639. DID one need a reason to kill? 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

One painting after another was sucked dry, and each painting could withstand millions of lives.

In a short period of time, tens of millions of people had sacrificed their lives to become nutrients for the northern lands.

Fortunately, the northern lands didn’t have many paintings, and they only had ten in total.

Because of this, many sects and cities were spared. However, they knew in their hearts that this was only temporary. They could be next at any time.

Teng men.

After the previous silence, the Elementalist’s strength had become stronger and more complete.

He no longer needed to rely on the snow mountain to absorb these paintings. Therefore, he did not return to the northern lands. Instead, he stayed in Teng men all day long.

In Teng Sect’s cultivation room, the Elementalist’s eyes were slightly closed.

The paintings emitted streams of internal Qi. These internal Qi were like the unceasing flow of river water that entered the elementalist’s body.

As these internal Qi entered his body, the Elementalist’s strength became stronger.

He Teng stood at the side and silently watched everything.

A trace of greed appeared in his heart. This trace of greed made he TENG’s heart stir.

“Why? Do you want to cultivate like him...”that hoarse voice sounded in his mind.

Unlike before, this time, his voice became extremely weak. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He Teng said coldly, “Why? Do you have a way?”

“No, that’s the method of the immortal slaying sect...”that hoarse voice sounded again.

He Teng mocked, “Since you don’t have it, then shut your mouth!”

The voice was silent for a moment before sighing, “I really didn’t expect that I would actually lose to you. It was really a wrong decision to live in your body back then...”

“Cherish your last moments of survival,”he teng said with a sneer.

At this moment, the elementalist in the cultivation room opened his eyes.

A powerful internal Qi instantly erupted!

He Teng’s expression changed slightly. He quickly bowed in fear of angering the elementalist.

In the blink of an eye, the elementalist had already stepped out.

He stood in front of he teng and said coldly, “What are you standing here for?”

He teng quickly said, “To answer the Lord’s question, I’m hiding here to observe your cultivation because of my worship and desire for your strength...”

The elementalist raised his hand and placed it on he Teng’s shoulder.

An extremely powerful force instantly pressed down. This force almost crushed he Teng’s arm!

He Teng did not dare to resist and slowly knelt down.

He knew very well that he could not appear too weak or too strong in front of an elementalist. Otherwise, he would easily arouse vigilance.

Looking at he teng who was kneeling on the ground, the elementalist said indifferently, “What did you see?”

“Master, I saw your cultivation method. I admire your method very much...”he teng quickly said.

The elementalist said indifferently, “You seem very curious. Why? Do you want to learn it?”

He teng quickly said, “I don’t dare...”

“Hahahaha!”The elementalist could not help but burst into laughter.

“Even if you want to learn it, it’s useless. Only I know this technique,”the elementalist said indifferently.

After saying this, the elementalist turned around and shot into the distance.

He Teng only slightly narrowed his eyes after the elementalist had gone far away.

He was a person who would do anything to succeed. He was also a hungry wolf. Anyone could suffer a backlash from him.

In the blink of an eye, countless cities in the South Province had been reduced to ghost cities.

Many people began to migrate to relatively safe places.

The South Province was extremely huge, and many places were desolate and uninhabited. These cultivators also knew that the less people there were, the safer they would be.

In just a short span of ten days, many cities were empty, and the people who remained were mostly the old, weak, and sick.

Seeing this scene, Sima bei could not help but have a cold expression on his face.

“Pass down my orders. From today onwards, no one is allowed to leave the city, or else kill!”Sima bei said coldly.

“Yes.”The black-robed man beside him hurriedly nodded.

Very quickly, they obtained the painting scrolls once again, and the ten paintings were absorbed in the next round.

Somewhere in the South Province.

He Teng and Yong Ji were walking side by side.

The two of them had something in common, so they were naturally in cahoots.

After comprehending the Sacred Heart technique, their strength had also increased, especially Yong Ji. He was only one step away from half-step void return.

Although he Teng’s realm was not as high as Yong Ji’s, he had absorbed the primordial spirit in his body, so his current strength was definitely not weaker than Yong Ji’s.

“Find an opportunity to kill Qin Yu first. It’s definitely not a good thing that he hasn’t shown up for such a long time,”Yongji said coldly.

He Teng smiled sinisterly and said, “Great Minds think alike. It seems that you know Qin Yu quite well...”

Yongji snorted and said, “This kid’s physique is extremely special. No one knows where his upper limit is.”

He Teng narrowed his eyes slightly and grinned. “As long as I can find him, I will definitely kill him myself. Where do you think he is now?”

As he spoke, someone suddenly ran over from not far away.

This person quickly came in front of the two and tried to say, “May I ask if the two of you are the godly monarchs of the northern lands?”

He Teng raised his brows and said indifferently, “I am the godly monarchs of the northern lands. Why?”

That person hurriedly said, “I have an important piece of news to tell you. Can you exchange it for my life?”

“That depends on the news,”Yong Ji said with a cold snort.

He Teng waved his hand and said with a faint smile, “As long as the information you provided is useful, not only can I exchange your life, but I can also protect your entire family. I can even let you join the northern lands.”

When that person heard this, he smiled sheepishly and said, “Joining the northern lands is fine as long as it can help us avoid that disaster.”

“No problem.”He Teng said with a faint smile.

That person looked around and then said in a low voice, “I know where Qin Yu is.”

When they heard this, the expressions of the two people instantly changed slightly.

“Is what you said true? where is he?”Yong Ji said somewhat excitedly.

Although he teng appeared quite calm on the surface, he was also excited in his heart.

“That Qin Yu is currently in the artifact-refining city! I have a relative who is a artifact-refining master. He happened to come to deliver the divine weapon these few days and accidentally brought up this matter!”That person said excitedly.

“Artifact-refining city?”Yong Ji frowned.

He narrowed his eyes and muttered in a low voice, “Could it be that this kid is refining some divine weapon?”

“You know about the artifact refining city?”He Teng glanced at him.

“Of course I know,”Yong Ji said coldly.

“Is this information useful? Can it be exchanged for the lives of my family members?”The person said with a smile.

He Teng narrowed his eyes slightly and said indifferently, “Of course.”

“Thank you, Godly King! I... Ah!”

Before he could finish his words, he teng suddenly attacked and pierced his chest with a palm!

Yong Ji frowned slightly and said, “Why did you kill him?”

“Do you need a reason to kill someone?”He Teng said with a faint smile.
