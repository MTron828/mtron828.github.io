2348 The Aristocratic Family’s Plan

“I forgot to wipe it.”

…

At this moment, in Solitary Cloud City…

The Moon Listening Pavilion had become a resting place for the higher-ups of the Holy Region. People from various factions kept coming and going from time to time.

Countless spiritual essences, soul stones, and treasures were handed over. Under the ruthless methods of the Holy Region, most sects and aristocratic families ultimately chose to submit. It was better to hand over these things than to lose their lives.

After being handed over, these items were divided into ten portions according to different proportions and transported away by the people from respective families.

In one of the rooms, a layer of spatial restriction was outside. This layer of spatial restriction blocked away all divine senses and sounds, and people could not detect what was happening in the room.

“When we interrogated the Ji family members earlier, an elder of my Ni family unexpectedly obtained some information that the Ji family might have changed their name and identity. Upon further investigation, it turned out to be a pleasant surprise for us!”

Ni Wuxiao looked tremendously shocked at this moment. He had just learned the specific information about the Ji family.

“It’s also thanks to Qin Yu appearing at that time, forcing me to activate our Yao family’s immortal scripture and invoking the power of our Yao family’s ancestral sage, that I could detect the anomaly in the Ji family’s bloodline.”

At this moment, Yao Xi’s face was also full of unconcealable joy.

“I didn’t expect this family to have the bloodline of a great aristocratic family! It’s actually the Jee family that has long lost in history. I always thought that the Jee family had no descendants. I didn’t expect some of their family members to survive today. No wonder they could have so many resources.”

Ni Wuxiao nodded.

“Back then, the Jee family brought most of the treasures to purgatory. No one could ever trace the whereabouts of these treasures. Ji Yue is a direct descendant of the Jee family, so she definitely knows about these related treasures. My Yao family and you must get these things!”

“Treasures are secondary. The most important thing is to get that sword.”

Ni Wuxiao looked solemn.

“Back then, the last ancestor of the Jee family blocked the entrance of the Holy Region with his strength and killed countless alien races with a single sword strike. He even resisted the Demon Emperor’s attack. This sword is the sword wielded by the Yellow Emperor Xuanyuan. It’s rumored that this sword can even make the Path of Heaven submit. Even all the treasures of our two families combined are probably not as precious as this sword.”

“Let’s keep this matter within our two families. We can’t let the other families know, especially Teng Zixu.”

At the mention of Teng Zixu, Yao Xi’s face was filled with fear.

The chosen one’s cultivation speed was too terrifying. His strength seemed to be increasing at all times, and his current strength was even more unfathomable.

“Ji Yue is still in Qin Yu’s hands, but I don’t think Ji Yue will tell Qin Yu about this. As long as we capture Ji Yue, everything will be easy to arrange, and the treasures left behind by the Jee family will be at our fingertips!”

“Therefore, we must plan carefully. Moreover, the Jee family’s ancestor might have set up a trap. We must consider all these.”

“Yes, the two Holy Lords have already been arranging their methods, and news should be coming soon.”

The two chatted in low voices for a long time.

…

On the Azure Ridge Continent…

Qin Yu was immersed in the cultivation of the holy body. Ten days had passed, and he had been absorbing the spiritual energy of the spiritual essence mountain.

At this moment, countless blood vessels had sprouted from his body. These blood vessels were connected to his acupuncture points, forming an internal circulation in his body.

The spiritual energy consumption of these blood vessels was not small. Each blood vessel consumed a vast amount of spiritual essence and spiritual energy.

The blood vessels extended from his glazed holy bone seemed to differ from before. The connections between the acupoints and the blood vessels were arranged in a way that Qin Yu could not understand.

However, after each blood vessel was connected, he would feel his body’s strength increase non-stop.

His body emitted a destructive fluctuation. Even Jue Wu, with her current strength, was terrified.

The Glazed Holy Body was like a magical artifact.

Back then on Earth, Qin Yu had been constantly tempering his body and even using his body as a material for the tempering by the artifact master.

When he entered the Holy Region, he cultivated the Saintly Body Technique and continuously tempered his body.

After entering purgatory, he first absorbed the energy of the bone cultivation water to transform his meridians, muscles, and bones.

He reconstructed his body in the lava on the Fire Unicorn Continent, and finally, under the scorching flames of the Vermilion Bird’s divine fire, he successfully formed a piece of glazed holy bone using the method of forging a magical artifact.

Even in his next life, Qin Yu was unsure if he could reconstruct such a holy body. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

He could now unleash 50% of his strength. His body was almost indestructible with the support of his bones and blood vessels.

He heaved a sigh of relief. The construction of this Glazed Saint Bone had consumed much of his soul power, making him feel fatigued.

Qin Yu came out of the Sumeu ring. He seemed to have experienced a great battle during the ten days of cultivation.

Elder Guai, Jue Wu, and some other cultivators had some minor injuries. Seeing Qin Yu appear, Elder Guai walked over.

“The spatial rift has expanded again. The Path of Heaven seems to be increasingly powerless against the low-level planes. This time, a ninth-grade True Saint monster race leader has appeared.

“If it weren’t for Wang Feng completing the early stage of the defensive formation, I’m afraid the cultivators here would have suffered heavy casualties. Moreover, the terrifying thing about these monsters is that they completely listened to the command of the monster race leader. Initially, Jue Wu could kill this monster race leader, but in the end, hundreds of monsters self-destructed to allow the leader to escape.

Qin Yu said with a frown. He had read some records.

Amidst the bloody battles between races in the previous turbulent times, regardless of the demon race, monster race, or ghost race, their strength individually was even more terrifying. An alien of the same cultivation realm required two humans of similar strength to suppress him.

Meanwhile, the human race excelled in team battles. But the situation seemed to have turned around now.

He could not predict how the situation would develop subsequently.

Under the push of the Path of Heaven, everything seemed to be a heavy wheel that kept rolling forward, and no one could stop it. All living beings would eventually become pawns of the Path of Heaven.

“This time, countless alien races have descended to purgatory. The humans have suffered heavy casualties. The Solitary Cloud City has also been besieged. Many cultivators from purgatory have been pushed to the frontlines to block the alien races. The people from the Holy Region did not make a move at all!”

Elder Guai sighed. As a tree demon race, he did not belong to the human race.
