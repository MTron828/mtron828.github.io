Chapter 1561: Chapter 1,561, lightning body tempering 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and looked up.

Hundreds of people stood in the air. Their internal Qi gathered together and was extremely dense.

“Damn it, it’s the Shocking Thunder Hall.”Jing Bai frowned slightly.

“Shocking Thunder Hall? What is that?”Qin Yu was puzzled.

Jing bai explained, “It’s a sect with great strength. They have been coveting the Hunter Organization for a long time.”

After saying that, Jing Bai shouted to the top, “Are you crazy? How dare you attack our Hunter Organization!”

“Hahahahaha!”Arrogant laughter came from the top.

“So what if it’s the hunter organization? This time, our Thunderbolt Hall has made full preparations!”

Jing Bai frowned slightly and said in a low voice, “I’m afraid that the news of the loss of the white bone staff has already spread out.”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said, “It’s about time. Didn’t you guys doubt the power of the Dragon Protection Formation? Now is a good opportunity.”

After saying that, Qin Yu directly retreated to the side.

Jing Bai frowned slightly and said, “Qin Yu, although this Thunderbolt Hall can’t be compared to a top-tier sect like the Heavenly Cloud sect, its strength is also extremely powerful. This formation...”

“Don’t worry,”Qin Yu said indifferently.

......

Jing Bai could only nod his head when he saw this.

He and Guan Zhuang exchanged a glance and planned to activate the formation to fight against the Thunderbolt Hall.

The two of them slightly closed their hands and raised their palms, causing the surrounding wind to gush over.

Immediately after, the dense fog seemed to have been hit by a storm and began to sweep over! ..

In the blink of an eye, the scattered fog actually condensed into two lifelike divine dragons!

The Divine Dragons were incomparably mighty, as if they came from an ancient myth.

Although these divine dragons looked extremely extraordinary, everyone was unable to sense the slightest bit of internal Qi from their bodies.

“Hahahahaha!”When the hall of Shocking Thunder saw this, they couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“Two dragons without any internal Qi. Why? Are they trying to resist my Thunderclap Hall?”

At this moment, the members of the hunter organization lost their confidence.

Jing Bai subconsciously looked at Qin Yu, but Qin Yu was lying there leisurely with his eyes slightly closed. It was quite comfortable.

Jing Bai gritted his teeth and looked at Guan Zhuang.

Their eyes met, and their minds instantly connected.

“Formation, Rise!”

The two of them roared in unison, and the two divine dragons immediately charged towards the hall of Shocking Thunder!

The hall master of the Hall of Shocking Thunder sneered, and with a flip of his palm, he took out a magical artifact that looked like a gong.

“You don’t know life from death.”The hall master of the Hall of Shocking Thunder snorted coldly, and immediately activated the gong. Immediately after, dark clouds covered the sky, and bolts of lightning surged down from the high sky, ruthlessly smashing towards the two divine dragons!

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu immediately opened his eyes.

“Lightning Element?”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

When he was on Earth, he had heard of the Lightning element, and had even collected a portion of the heavenly tribulation.

But ever since he came to the holy region, he had never heard of it again.

Now that he saw the lightning that the hall master of the Thunderbolt Hall had summoned, he couldn’t help but be shocked!

The Lightning rushed towards the two divine dragons.

But at the moment of contact, the Divine Dragon opened its bloody mouth and swallowed the Lightning!

In the next second, the Lightning came out of his mouth and headed straight for the members of the Thunderbolt Hall!

Before the members of the Thunderbolt Hall could react, the second divine dragon had already swept over!

That huge body swept over everyone at an extremely fast speed. The terrifying force instantly shattered their bodies!

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

One had to know that this formation core used an iron rod! The power of the Iron Rod was unimaginable. How could they withstand it?

They originally thought that it would be a fierce battle, but in a short moment, more than half of the Thunderbolt Hall was killed!

The many hunters watched with their mouths agape, as if they didn’t dare to believe that this dragon protection formation had such terrifying power!

“Alright, put away the formation,”Qin Yu said to Jing Bai.

Jing Bai and Guan Zhuang immediately closed the formation according to Qin Yu’s request.

In a moment, the entire hunter organization was restored to its original state and was covered by the fog.

Qin Yu raised his head to look at the shocked Hall Master of the Thunderbolt Hall. With a deep leap, he arrived in front of him in an instant.

“You... I...”

The moment he saw Qin Yu, the Hall Master of the Thunderbolt Hall could not hold back a fart for a long time.

Qin Yu reached out to take the gong and drum in his hand and began to fiddle with it.

“Let me ask you, where did this thing come from?”Qin Yu asked.

The Hall Master of the Thunderbolt Hall hurriedly said, “This... this is something I got by chance...”

“By chance? Then do you know what the Lightning element is?”Qin Yu asked.

He shook his head, and a hint of confusion flashed across his face.

Qin Yu held the magical artifact silently. He tried to sense the internal Qi of the gong and drum.

As expected, the sky was once again filled with dark clouds, and bolts of lightning condensed like lightning snakes! 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

However, this lightning was hundreds of times larger than the one summoned by the hall master just now!

“I’ll go.”

Seeing this scene, even Qin Yu was shocked!

This magical artifact was actually so powerful?

“Rumble...”

The Lightning fell down like a silver waterfall from the nine heavens!

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes. He suddenly had an absurd and crazy idea!

Qin Yu’s body shook and shot toward the Lightning!

Then, the Lightning Swallowed Qin Yu’s body.

Under the huge lightning bolt, there was no trace of Qin Yu!

“Qin Yu!”

Jing Bai and Guan Guan shouted at the same time!

The surrounding hunters could not help but be shocked as they covered their mouths!

Jing Bai, who did not know what was going on, thought that the Hall Master of the Thunderbolt Hall was behind this. He glared at the hall master and gritted his teeth as he said, “I’m going to kill you!”

“No... It’s none of my business!”The hallmaster was in a panic. He had no idea what had happened.

However, Jing Bai and Guan Zhuang, who were in a state of anger, did not listen to him.

They were about to activate the Dragon Protection Formation and kill the hallmaster of the Hall of Shocking Thunder!

“Alright, stop.”

But at this moment, Qin Yu’s voice came from the Lightning.

He walked out from the Lightning. His clothes were torn and his body was bleeding.

“Qin Yu, are... Are You Alright?”Guan Zhuang rushed over.

Qin Yu looked at his body and shook his head, “I’m fine.”

His body was slowly healing. His exposed bones were shining with a faint golden light.

“Why did you suddenly rush into the Lightning?”Jing Bai walked forward and asked in puzzlement.

Qin Yu looked up at the dark clouds, squinted his eyes, and said, “This lightning... is a treasure to temper one’s body...”

“Temper one’s body?”

Jing Bai and Guan Zhuang were stunned.

Temper one’s body with this lightning? was he crazy?

“Such strength is just right for tempering one’s body,”Qin Yu said with a sneer.
