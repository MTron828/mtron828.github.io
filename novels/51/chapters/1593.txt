Chapter 1594: Chapter 1,594, Iron Egg 1, who had recovered his strength Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu and even ye Nan couldn’t help but approach the bronze coffin.

Inside the coffin, the body didn’t move at all, and one couldn’t feel the slightest flow of internal Qi.

“Hahaha! Qin Yu, leave this body to me!”Heavenly Blood Rainbow shouted excitedly.

Ye Nan, who was beside him, also said indifferently, “How is it? In the end, this divine body still belongs to me.”

Qin Yu frowned, puzzled.

With Iron Egg’s ability, he shouldn’t have failed. Could it be that there was something wrong with this body?

Just as everyone was excited, the body in the coffin suddenly opened its eyes!

Two beams of light shot out and directly pierced through the ceiling of the mansion!

The sudden change made everyone extremely frightened, and they all stepped back!

Soon, iron egg sat up from the coffin.

He had an extremely evil smile on his face, and his internal Qi was terrifyingly powerful!

Iron Egg lowered his head to look at his body and said in a low voice, “Finally... I’ve finally recovered. I’ve finally regained my freedom. hahahahaha!”

The crazy laughter shook the entire room, and debris kept falling down!

Qin Yu was instantly overjoyed. He quickly walked in front of iron egg and said, “How do you feel?”

“Very good, even better than before!”Iron egg grinned, revealing his white teeth.

His originally delicate and pretty face looked extremely evil under Iron Egg’s smile.

Qin Yu finally heaved a sigh of relief. With Iron Egg’s help, he did not need to come to ye Nan for help.

Therefore, Qin Yu looked at ye Nan and said, “I don’t need your help now. Give me back what I gave you before.”

However, ye Nan wouldn’t let it go. He sneered and said, “Give it back to you? Are You Dreaming? You still want what’s in My Hands?”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “Are you really not going to give it back to me?”

“Absolutely not!”Ye Nan waved his hand and made the worst decision of his life.

In the next second, before Qin Yu could say anything, iron egg suddenly stretched out two fingers, and with a “Puchi”sound, it directly sank into ye Nan’s skull!

Ye Nan widened his eyes, as if he could not believe the scene in front of him.

Before he could come back to his senses, iron egg had already pulled out his fingers!

He grabbed ye Nan’s primordial spirit with his finger, then opened his mouth and swallowed the primordial spirit!

Ye Nan’s body fell straight down, without a trace of life left.

“I’ve wanted to kill you for a long time, yet you still grumble in front of me...”iron egg licked his lips, looking extremely satisfied.

“This body... is really more comfortable than I imagined. As expected of a divine body, it easily penetrated his body...”iron egg said with an evil look.

Qin Yu didn’t expect iron egg to suddenly kill ye Nan. He couldn’t help but frown.

According to iron egg, he used to be a killer or a maniac.

Now that he had recovered his body, Qin Yu was also a bit worried.

What if Iron Egg had recovered his nature?

He had said that there was a mark in his body to scare iron egg. With Iron Egg’s ability and experience, he would find out sooner or later.

“Phew.”Qin Yu let out a long breath. Since this body had been given to iron egg, there was no need to think too much.

He turned to look at the stunned butler and said with a frown, “Where are Ye Nan’s Treasures?”

The butler gulped and said, “To... to answer Mr. Qin’s words, part of them are in his spatial magic artifact and part of them are in the warehouse...”

Qin Yu looked down at Ye Nan and saw a bracelet hanging on his wrist.

This must be his spatial magic artifact. Qin Yu took it off and tried to use his divine sense to take out the treasures in the spatial magic artifact.

Unfortunately, Qin Yu couldn’t use his divine sense to probe into it.

Obviously, this spatial magic artifact was bound to Ye Nan.

“It’s broken. I Can’t open the spatial magic artifact.”Qin Yu looked at Iron Egg.

Iron Egg turned his head to the side, as if this matter had nothing to do with him.

“It seems that I can only keep this spatial magic artifact for now,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Without a doubt, the top-tier treasures in ye Nan’s hands must be hidden in this spatial magic artifact.

Then, Qin Yu looked at the butler and said, “Take me to the warehouse.”

“Yes, yes.”

The Butler didn’t dare to say anything more. He immediately took Qin Yu and iron egg to the warehouse.

Along the way, iron egg was getting used to this body. He was very satisfied with this body.

The God body and his powerful primordial spirit made iron egg full of confidence.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He couldn’t figure out Iron Egg’s thoughts, and he wasn’t sure if iron egg would betray him.

The three of them arrived at Ye Nan’s warehouse.

The moment the warehouse was opened, a strange fragrance assailed their nostrils.

The walls of the warehouse were inlaid with cabinets. These cabinets were made of special materials, which could guarantee the nature of the heavenly materials and earthly treasures to the greatest extent.

At a glance, the entire warehouse was dazzling with everything!

“This little bastard has quite a lot of Babe.”Iron Egg licked his lips, and a hint of greed appeared in his eyes.

Qin Yu and iron egg opened these cabinets. Not only were there herbs in these cabinets, there were also some precious materials and incomplete magical artifact. There were even top-notch cultivation techniques and cultivation holy items.

“Damn, this ye Nan is really a living treasure vault.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

Without thinking, he put these treasures into his spatial magic artifact.

Fortunately, Qin Yu’s spatial magic artifact was extremely unique, and its carrying capacity was extremely strong. Even though there were countless treasures in this warehouse, it was still easily put in.

“Even the warehouse has so many Babe. Then Ye Nan’s spatial magic artifact probably has even more treasures,”Qin Yu thought to himself. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

At this moment, iron egg suddenly struck out with his palm, directly smashing the butler into meat paste.

“Comfortable. This is the feeling!”Iron Egg’s eyes became even greedier.

Qin Yu frowned. He looked at iron egg and said coldly, “What are you doing?”

“Killing people. Why?”Iron Egg said with a half-smile.

“You don’t have to kill him,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Iron egg laughed and said, “Do I need a reason to kill people? I want to kill people, can’t I?”

After saying that, iron egg shook his arm and said with a faint smile, “Qin Yu, who am I? I have told you before that killing people is my hobby. I can kill whoever I want!”

Qin Yu’s expression was cold as he looked at iron egg with some vigilance.

The Way Iron Egg looked at Qin Yu was also very strange. There was a cold smile on his face, and a strong chill was emitted from his body.

Their eyes met, and the atmosphere was extremely cold.
