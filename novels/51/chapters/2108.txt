2109 The Quick-witted Jue Wu

Qin Yu sighed, waved his hand, and said, “Forget it.”

In the current situation, he could only let Yao Meng wait.

“Wait!” Just as Qin Yu felt dejected, Jue Wu suddenly shouted at the side.

She ran to Li Shen, slammed the table, and said, “You want me to plead with Old Man Lei, right?”

Li Shen was startled. Facing the somewhat unruly Jue Wu, he had no choice but to nod.

Pointing at Qin Yu, Jue Wu said, “You want my help? Sure, but you have to agree to Qin Yu’s request first!”

Li Shen laughed bitterly and said, “This isn’t something I alone can decide. The Alchemist Association has its rules. I can only…”

“What rules? It’s none of my business! In that case, forget it!” Jue Wu rolled her eyes.

Then she held Qin Yu’s hand and said, “Let’s go!”

Li Shen sat there dumbfounded as if he didn’t expect Jue Wu to have such a hot temper.

Seeing Jue Wu and Qin Yu about to leave, Li Shen said helplessly, “I can try to suggest to the dean, but I can’t guarantee he’ll agree…”

“I can try to suggest to Old Man Lei, but I can’t guarantee he’ll agree…” Jue Wu said, imitating Li Shen.

Li Shen was instantly speechless.

Without a doubt, Jue Wu already had complete control over Li Shen.

Li Shen shook his head helplessly. Looking at Qin Yu and Jue Wu, he sighed and said, “Alright, I’ll do my best, but I need some time. I hope you guys can wait for a while.”

Jue Wu pouted. Obviously, she was not very satisfied with Li Shen’s words. However, she did not say anything and just pulled Qin Yu to sit down.

“If this matter can be settled, I can help you.” Although Li Shen was somewhat displeased, he still agreed in the end.

Only then did Jue Wu say smugly, “Don’t worry. As long as I plead with Old Man Lei, he will surely agree! Tell me, when are you going to help Qin Yu save that friend?”

“Are you sure Dean Lei will agree?” Li Shen sized up Jue Wu and said.

“Of course! If he doesn’t agree, I’ll pull his beard…”

Before Jue Wu finished speaking, Qin Yu hurriedly stopped her and said with a smile, ” President Li, don’t worry. Jue Wu holds a very important position in Dean Lei’s heart.”

“Alright then.” Li Shen nodded.” Then you guys go and make the arrangements. When the time comes, bring that person to me. I’ll take you guys to the Alchemist Association.”

After leaving the place, Qin Yu looked at Jue Wu with gratitude and said, “Jue Wu, thank you.”

“If you continue to be so polite with me, I’ll beat you up!” Jue Wu said, waving her small fists.

Looking at Jue Wu’s cheeky appearance, Qin Yu was indescribably joyful.

After that, Qin Yu and Jue Wu went to a restaurant to have an extravagant meal. After they were full, the two planned to go to the Yao family.

“You’ve just won against Yao Xi and even injured him severely. If you go to the Yao family now, I’m afraid the Yao family won’t let you off,” Jue Wu said on the way to the teleportation formation.

“Worst scenario, let me go, and you wait here.” Jue Wu grabbed Qin Yu’s arm.

“I know how they wish they could tear me into pieces, but I don’t think they’ll do that,” Qin Yu sneered and said. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“The Yao family’s reputation has been tarnished. If they rely on the family’s elders to make a move, Yao Xi’s dao mind will definitely destroy!”

Jue Wu frowned and said softly, “But I heard the Yao family has been looking for you.”

“It was just a boastful claim. Even Hu Kai could find me. If the Yao family really wanted to look for me, they would have come long ago,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Just as Qin Yu had guessed, the Yao family was indeed looking for Qin Yu. However, they could not do anything even if they could find him.

Therefore, Qin Yu and Jue Wu took the teleportation formation and headed straight for the Yao family.

Yao City, the city of the Yao family, had unparalleled magnificence and grandeur.

The city walls were hundreds of feet tall, and all kinds of protective formations that could block all attacks were engraved on them.

At the opening of the city gate, two tall stone lions bared their fangs and brandished their claws. Their eyes widened as they looked outside the city gate as if they could swallow their enemies alive.

Qin Yu had long been accustomed to this scene. The only thing that surprised Qin Yu was that everyone in this city was from the Yao family.

Therefore, not long after Qin Yu stepped into Yao City, he was targeted by numerous people.

Their icy gazes were as chilling as the icy wind that was bone-piercing. If eye expression could kill, Qin Yu would have long become a cold corpse.

Soon, some people could no longer restrain themselves.

Several young cultivators blocked Qin Yu’s way. Staring at Qin Yu coldly, immensely terrifying killing intent surged from their bodies.

“Why? Is there something you want from me?” Qin Yu appeared rather indifferent, not taking these few people seriously at all.

One of them shouted, “You’ve just severely injured our Holy Son. How dare you come to Yao City? You’re really audacious!”

“Why wouldn’t I dare?” Qin Yu sneered and said. “Yao Xi himself was not as skilled and lost to me. He can’t blame anyone else!”

“Bullsh*t! Our Holy Son was just kind enough to let you off easy. Otherwise, how would you be a match for our Holy Son?” another young man shouted.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Do you believe this yourself? What? Is the Yao family such a sore loser? What a disgrace!”

“You!” Qin Yu instantly angered these few people, but they were helpless because of their weak strength. No one dared to make a move against Qin Yu.

Qin Yu could not be bothered with them. He pushed everyone aside and continued to rush toward the Yao family.

Qin Yu encountered numerous cold gazes along the way, but no one stopped him.

Soon, Qin Yu and Jue Wu arrived at the main gate of the Yao family.

The gate was incredibly imposing, symbolizing the Yao family’s powerful strength.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and was just about to step forward when a person was directly thrown out!

“Don’t think that I don’t know about your relationship with that Qin Yu! You both came from the same place, so you definitely know each other!”

“That’s right. Qin Yu injured the Holy Son, and you still have the guts to stay in the Yao family?”

“You’re a useless person, a useless person who can’t cultivate. And you still want to mooch off the Yao family?”

A few of them were cursing, and the person who was thrown out was none other than Yao Meng.

Yao Meng was silent. Her body was full of bruises, and she struggled to get up.

At this moment, Qin Yu reached out and helped Yao Meng up.

Yao Meng was stunned. She looked up and saw Qin Yu’s familiar face.

“Qin Yu, you…” Yao Meng opened her mouth in surprise and joy.

“Hahaha, this Qin Yu actually came to the door. Yao Meng, how are you going to explain this?” The few Yao family cultivators immediately shouted when they saw this.
