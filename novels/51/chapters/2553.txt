Chapter 2554 The Seal of Heaven Returning

This matter would cause the collapse of all the sects that continued the Three Purities Clear Teachings.

Chen Shuang was stunned for a long time.

With a wave of his hand, an enormous image appeared at the top of the hall, where Zi Yang’s tablet stood.

He let out a miserable roar, and it sounded like he was enduring the harshest punishment in the world.

“You’ve been fighting against this will for two Path of Heaven years? Zi Yang…”

…

Chen Shuang took a long time to come back to his senses.

“Qin Yu, you must keep Zi Yang’s matter a secret for us. Otherwise, I’m afraid the human race will be in great turmoil.”

Among the human race, many cultivators cultivated on the path of Daoism.

If they knew their ultimate goal was the will to destroy the human race, nobody knew what kind of unrest that might cause.

Qin Yu looked somewhat bitter. At this moment, he felt even more lost.

Based on his understanding of Daoism, Daoism’s indifference to Heaven and Earth and the principle of effortless governing encouraged them to watch coldly from the sidelines and follow the will of the Path of Heaven as their fundamental principle.

However, cultivators were humans. As long as they were humans, they would have emotions.

How many people could completely cut off this emotion and abandon the foundation of the human race?

Chen Shuang’s face was ashen.

Although he had already guessed it, he was still tremendously shocked when he learned of this news.

It meant if the path Zi Yang saw was true, the human race’s Path of Heaven had changed.

He had no chance to pursue the Tribulation Seventh Level path of the divine in this lifetime, and the ultimate goal the entire Daoist community pursued had become illusory.

“Sect Master Chen Shuang, what do you plan to do next?”

Qin Yu asked bitterly. Previously, Chen Zhisha of the Ten Thousand Budhha Sect seemed to have foreseen the future, and his idea was to preserve a part of the human race’s seedlings. And now, Zi Yang fell into a similar situation.

“In this lifetime, I have no chance to step onto the path of the divine. In the future, I will surely demand something in return from this Path of Heaven.”

Chen Shuang looked at the sky for a long time before speaking softly.

“Alright, my matter is settled. Ask me if you have any questions.”

Chen Shuang turned around. He had already resumed his calm internal qi.

“Do you know my father?”

When Qin Yu heard Chen Shuang say “closely resemble”, he should be referring to Qin Yu’s resemblance to his father.

“Not only do I know him, he is the most talented person I have ever met. Perhaps he was also the first to sense the changes in the Path of Heaven. How much do you know about the Guardian?”

Qin Yu shook his head. He had seen him a few times, but he never truly understood the core of who he was.

“When a Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivator reaches the Saint Realm, he becomes unrivaled. He will occupy the cosmic luck of heaven and earth, and heaven and earth can no longer conceal the aura of a Saint. If a Saint advances further, he will reach the power of the seventh level, condense divinity, snatch the cosmic luck of heaven and earth, and fight against heaven and earth.”

“What level is the Guardian at? What about an Imperial Immortal?”

Qin Yu asked doubtfully.

“There are two types of changes above the Seventh Level Divine. The first is the Guardian chosen by heaven and earth. That is the heaven and earth’s representative, the number one person below the Path of Heaven. With a thought, he can use the power of heaven and earth. The other was to fight against heaven, jump out of the Path of Heaven, and become an Immortal Emperor. There are two different paths and two different choices. A Guardian might not necessarily be weaker than the Heavenly Emperor and might be stronger instead.

“Back then, your father and I had a battle at the Saint level. He was the most thoughtful person I’ve ever seen. He had already seen the scene today when he was a Saint. I thought it was just a vague guess at that time, but now, he seems to be absolutely right.”

“Are you saying my father has already predicted today’s human disaster?”

Qin Yu said in surprise.

“He is the most powerful in cultivation, and one sees the farthest among those I’ve encountered. I once thought he would jump out of the Path of Heaven and become an Immortal Emperor. I didn’t expect him to choose to become a Guardian, and even today, I still feel that he’s not dead and has many backup plans.”

Qin Yu was silent. Up until now, he still had not completely understood his father.

He gave him the feeling that he was a kind father, but his father seemed far more complex than he had imagined. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I can’t see through your father’s methods either. I’m just sharing with you some of my understanding. As for you, you have to wait until you can break through to the Saint Realm before you can understand what’s going on moving forward. If you haven’t reached the Saint Realm, everything is in vain.

“Now that the Cage of the Path of Heaven has sealed heaven and earth. I’ve come into contact with that extreme power but can’t break through.”

Qin Yu laughed bitterly and said.

“Nothing is set in stone, just like the future that Zi Yang saw. Who knows if it’s real or not?”

Chen Shuang stood facing Qin Yu. He formed 100,000 hand seals with his hands.

The power of the Saint surged within the mark and slowly flew into the air.

It entered a jade pendant, which appeared on Qin Yu’s neck subsequently.

After performing all this, Qin Yu felt that Chen Shuang in front of him had aged a lot.

“You may go now. This is what our Three Purities Sect owes you and what I owe your father.”

“The Seal of Heaven Returning! It’s the supreme seal condensed by Daoist Saints using their blood essence. A Saint has helped heal the injuries within your body. You’ve struck gold, kid!”

In Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness, Immortal Emperor Yao’s aged voice softly spoke.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s body seemed to have formed a cycle with heaven and earth. A healing and rebirth power constantly nourished his body.

The cells nearing exhaustion started to replenish, regaining the vitality of life.

Qin Yu was stunned. This mark was not as simple as just repairing his body.

It seemed to have formed an energy field in his body. This balance covered the physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual levels.

This was Chen Shuang’s understanding of Dao. He had infused all of his understandings into this mark.

Moreover, there were even many other functions that Qin Yu had yet to discover.

However, it should be a tremendously powerful supreme treasure. Otherwise, Immortal Emperor Yao would not have complimented it.

Qin Yu was not in a hurry to leave. He sat cross-legged and began to guide the energy of the Heaven Returning Jade Pendant to speed up the recovery of his body.

The Saint’s power ran through his entire body, slowly repairing his exhausted body after using the life and death brush.

This was the first time Qin Yu felt the power of the Saint so clearly. If every drop of his chaotic elemental energy was a drop of water, then the power of the Saint was a pool.

The difference between them could be comprehended with just one sentence.

The power of all Saints was called the power of heaven and earth. The power of the fifth level could only be said to be the power of an individual. There was no way to compare at all.

At this moment, his entire body was being repaired by the Seal of Heaven Returning. This power was like a clear spring washing his body.

It slowly washed away the curse power after using the Judge’s Brush.

Only after a long time did cracks appear in the shackles binding various parts of his body.
