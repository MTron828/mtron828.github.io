Chapter 1447: Chapter 1,447, the miserable great elder 1

With just two slaps, the demon subduing lamp was shattered just like that?

Everyone let out a cry of surprise, and countless people sucked in a breath of cold air at this moment!

“As expected of the ultimate dance led by sanfeng...”someone swallowed his saliva, his face filled with shock.

Qin Yu also rubbed her eyes, as if she couldn’t believe everything.

“Ultimate dance... did she break through?”Qin Yu asked, puzzled.

Big Wen said proudly, “Of course! After Auntie Ultimate Dance broke through, we immediately notified her and asked her to rush to the scene to save you. How is it? Are you touched?”

“And me. I was the one who notified her.”Wen Er hurriedly came forward.

Qin Yu rolled her eyes at them and said, “Alright, I’ll treat you two to a drink later.”

“Damn, that’s great. It’s been too long since I’ve tasted meat,”the two of them said excitedly.

In the air, the Great Elder’s expression became even more unsightly.

At this moment, he regretted it. He regretted that he had acted rashly!

“Little Bastard, you dare to attack me?”Jue Wu rubbed her small hands and glared at the great elder fiercely. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

She had a fierce expression, but because of her small face, she always found it funny.

Of course, the great elder did not find it funny at all. In his eyes, there was only fear at this moment!

The great elder gritted his teeth and cupped his hands. “Lord... Lord Jue Wu, I was blinded by anger just now. Please forgive me...”

“F * CK Your Grandpa!”

Jue Wu kicked the first Elder’s butt and sent him flying hundreds of meters away.

Jue Wu would not let it go. She shook her small feet and followed him.

Then, Jue Wu waved her small hands and slapped the first elder’s face.

One slap, two slaps. A series of slaps made the first elder’s face bloody and his bones crooked.

Everyone watched in horror, but no one dared to make a sound.

They all knew that once Jue Wu went crazy, no one could stop him.

“Enough!”

The Great Elder, who had been beaten up, finally couldn’t hold it in any longer.

He roared angrily and then grabbed the demon subduing divine lamp.

“Jue Wu, you’ve gone too far. I’ll fight you to the death!”The Great Elder grabbed the divine lamp, intending to fight to the death.

However, just as he picked up the divine lamp, Jue Wu grabbed the great elder’s arm and pulled it off forcefully. The divine lamp fell into Jue Wu’s hand.

The Great Elder was stunned for half a second before he wailed in pain!

“You still dare to F * cking hold the lamp, right?”Jue Wu grabbed the divine lamp with a furious expression.

The Great Elder’s face was filled with fear. He no longer dared to be arrogant and hurriedly begged for mercy, “Master Jue Wu, I was wrong. Please spare me...”

“Crack!”

Before he could finish his words, Jue Wu grabbed his other arm and pulled it off.

Before he could even play with it, Jue Wu’s hair fluttered in the wind as she pounced at the great elder with bared fangs and brandished claws.

She broke the great elder’s four limbs and then lay on the Great Elder’s body and began to gnaw like a wild beast.

“Ah! ! !”

The first elder’s painful wail spread throughout the entire scene, reverberating in the valley for a long time.

Not long after, the first Elder’s chest was gnawed open by the absolute dance. At a glance, one could clearly see her internal organs.

The surrounding crowd seemed to be unable to bear to watch any longer, and they all turned their heads.

Qin Yu could not help but feel that it was a little bloody. She muttered softly, “Why is he still biting people...”

The first Elder was beaten until he had no strength to fight back. His life force was also rapidly weakening.

However, Jue Wu had no intention of killing him. After a round of torture, Jue Wu wiped the blood on his mouth and jumped to the side in satisfaction.

On the other hand, the first elder was lying on the ground like a pile of rotten meat. If it was not for the fact that his nose was still breathing, no one would have recognized him as a living creature.

“The next time you dare to shout at me, I’ll teach you a lesson.”Jue Wu snorted lightly and then walked over to Qin Yu.

“Tell me, how should you thank me?”Jue Wu sat on Qin Yu’s shoulder as usual.

Qin Yu coughed dryly and said, “How do you want me to thank you?”

“En... I have to think about this carefully. I’ll tell you later.”Jue Wu played with the magic lamp in her hand and muttered.

“What is this thing? Why doesn’t it light up? What rubbish is it?”

Jue Wu muttered a few words and casually threw the magic lamp to the side.

Seeing this, Qin Yu hurriedly reached out and grabbed the magic lamp.

“If you don’t want it, why did you throw it away?”Qin Yu said with a shocked expression.

Jue Wu stared at him and said, “How would I know that you want it? Why didn’t you tell me earlier?”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and then sighed. He didn’t say anything else.

He knew that he couldn’t make sense of Jue Wu at all.

Therefore, he kept the magic lamp in his bag.

“Let’s go. It’s time to drink,”Wen da said with a smile.

“Yes, yes, yes. I want to drink too. I’m bored to death these few days,”Jue Wu also said.

Qin Yu glanced at Zhuo Jing and said, “Let’s Go and drink.”

Zhuo Jing paused for a moment, then smiled and said, “Okay!”
