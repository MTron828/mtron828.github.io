2309 The Cultivators of the Ninth Level of Purgatory

After much hesitation, Qin Yu decided to wait a little longer.

At that time, his divine sense could see more places, and he would be even safer.

Otherwise, with the living beings in the ninth level of purgatory, Qin Yu really did not have the confidence to stay alive and obtain the Sumeru qi.

After another three months of frantic absorption, Qin Yu finally gave up.

Toward the end, the cultivation speed of the Soul Torment Mind Technique had already become increasingly slower. The excruciating pain caused him immense pain when he absorbed every trace of soul power.

He could not even remember how many times he had fainted. Whenever he fainted, Xi Menn would silently protect him.

As for Ximen, he would go alone to deal with these wandering souls. Each time, he would be riddled with injuries and continue to cultivate.

The two were at the outermost edge and dared not cross the line.

Qin Yu looked at the purgatory covered in dense mist and dared not imagine.

At this moment, his divine sense could already see about 70 meters away. He walked around the Sumeru qi for a distance and confirmed no other living beings were in this range.

“Qin Yu, although the Sumeru qi is important, your life is relatively more important.”

Old Guai said softly.

“Hey, Qin Yu, don’t tell me you really want to go. I have a few in my spatial ring, too. I’ll give them to you.”

The expression of the man with the mustache was somewhat shocked.

“Elder Guai, this is my opportunity. I must go. I’ve already missed the Golden Great Dao. If I don’t risk my life, I’m afraid I can’t return to the Holy Region for the rest of my life. I’ll send you all to the eighth level first!”

Qin Yu shook his head. Moreover, he had an idea for the Sumeru qi and needed to try it.

He would have a better chance against Si Shiyue in the future if he succeeded.

“Hahaha, you’re indeed a heroic young man, like father like son! Since you have such spirit, I will accompany you on your journey. Please add my cosmic luck!”

Elder Guai laughed loudly.

Xiaoru and Little Fatty were also unwilling to go out.

This time, it was Qin Yu’s turn to be hesitant.

“Qin Yu, just set off immediately. Our determination is not inferior to yours.”

Elder Guai said with a smile, without the slightest bit of worry.

“Xi Menn, I’m going in to collect the Sumeru qi. Just leave if anything happens.”

Qin Yu said softly.

Although Xi Menn did not speak much, he did not know why he was completely at ease with this person. He had fainted countless times before him over the past few days.

He seemed to be able to guarantee his safety with him by his side.

It was the same for Xi Menn. These two persons talked in less than 10 sentences in total but trusted each other like old friends.

Qin Yu hesitated for a moment. He plucked a Spirit Storage Pearl and handed it to Xi Menn.

“Help me pass this to Yan Ruoxue of the Holy Region and apologize to her for me if I unfortunately die.”

Xi Menn took over the Spirit Storage Bead and nodded expressionlessly.

The instant Qin Yu turned around, his expression was incomparably determined.

It was the same determination that Xiao Hai had when he crossed the Dead Sea.

He slowly walked toward the location of the Sumeru qi, and his divine sense was released to the utmost.

He was fully prepared with the defenses on his body.

The eyes of Xi Menn behind him revealed a hint of worry.

While approaching the area nearly a thousand meters from the Sumeru qi, there was a place full of countless fierce energy.

Countless living beings with terrifying internal qi were roaming aimlessly. And among the various fierce beings…

Three people were floating in the air, seated. When the fierce beings without consciousness passed by the three of them, they subconsciously avoided them.

“Did you all notice that after the tide of the Path of Heaven, this place has become a little bit more lively? There are even living beings from the ghost realm and the monster race.”

A woman with a half-transparent white veil covering her face, her unparalleled beauty radiating through her features, spoke softly.

“Gu Baiyi, Jiang Qingyuan, I noticed it, too. Moreover, the Demon Emperor’s body doesn’t seem to intend to suppress these living beings. If the three races join forces, I’m afraid the human race will be in trouble. Previously, when the demon race attacked, the human race had almost exhausted their cosmic luck to win the battle.”

One of them, whose upper body was bare and his bulging muscles were embedded with countless scars, said.

“It’s useless to be afraid. I just hope that the people of the human race will work harder. Otherwise, the human race might be wiped out when the world is in chaos.”

“Sigh, the qi of the Path of Heaven is weak. There’s no need to talk about the cultivators in this galaxy. Up until now, only a few decent cultivators have appeared. I sent a wisp of my soul to the Holy Region to take a look, but I didn’t seem to see anyone who could surprise me. We can only hope that the various aristocratic families would nurture more people under the Golden Great Dao.”

Jiang Qingyuan said with a bitter smile.

“Hmm, there’s somebody? A fourth-grade True Saint kid? Chaotic body?”

Yan Minglong frowned.

Qin Yu, in the dense mist, instantly felt like being locked on by a terrifying divine sense.

He could only sense the approximate location of this divine sense, but he could not find anything when he looked at the approximate location.

“Interesting, he actually noticed you.”

Gu Baiyi widened her beautiful eyes and said curiously.

“His strength is too low. I really don’t know how he managed to come here.” Yan Minglong shook his head.

“He must have something special. Otherwise, he won’t be here. Should we save him? He’ll die if he moves on further.”

Gu Baiyi said hesitantly.

“So what if he dies? Don’t forget our mission. A fourth-grade True Saint cultivator isn’t worth our time.”

Yan Minglong shook his head.

…

Qin Yu naturally did not notice such a scene in the mist. He stood on the spot and dared not make any movements.

After a long time, he saw that the divine sense did not have any movement.

Only then did he heave a sigh of relief. When he came back to his senses, he realized his body had been covered in cold sweat.

In this environment where one could die at any time, his nerves were tense to the extreme, and he dared not be careless.

Qin Yu continued to walk forward slowly and finally came to a place about five meters in front of the large mass of Sumeru qi.

A crack appeared in the space in the center of the Sumeru Qi.

A strange internal qi seeped out from inside. It felt like a mixture of demonic qi and ghost qi, and the Sumeru qi was constantly seeping in from the black hole.

The Sumeru qi emerged from the void. Qin Yu did not expect to bump into it here.

“Whoosh!”

When Qin Yu’s divine sense was inspecting the crack, he suddenly felt a deadly pale eye staring at him.

He felt extreme horror in that instant, and his hair stood on end.
