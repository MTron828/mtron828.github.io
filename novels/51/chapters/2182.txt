2183 Wu Ji?

It was because this person was none other than Wu Ji!

Qin Yu had seen his figure numerous times in the Traceless Immortal Scripture and admired him countless times.

Now that he had appeared, shock filled Qin Yu’s heart. Even his dao mind was a little unstable, and even the internal qi around him was faintly fluctuating!

“Wu Ji…” Qin Yu murmured and subconsciously stepped back.

This person was definitely not Wu Ji’s true form but a manifestation of the dao technique!

The dao technique could evolve everything in this world, and Wu Ji was no exception! FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

But now, in front of Qin Yu, Wu Ji was too vivid as if the real Wu Ji had descended!

His eyes filled with endless battle intent and arrogance. The internal qi surging from his body was even more supreme as if he did not care about anything at all!

“The dao technique can evolve into Wu Ji’s body. Could it be… Wu Ji had really died…” Qin Yu suddenly felt a little lost.

Wu Ji was the most formidable chaotic body in history. He relied on extraordinary perseverance and talent to step into the Tribulation Transcendence Stage at the end stage of the dao technique. He even achieved dao via an alternate way and killed the Immortal Emperor!

Such an outstanding battle record was unprecedented!

As for his whereabouts, it had always been a mystery. Some people said he lost his lifespan because he had forcefully comprehended the dao and died. Some also said he had long left this world to search for a new dao technique.

The debates between the two perspectives were endless. But today, witnessing Wu Ji from the manifestation of the dao technique seemed to have brought a definitive conclusion.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and kept adjusting his state of mind and internal qi.

Then he looked up at Wu Ji again.

But when Qin Yu looked at Wu Ji, he could not help but feel guilty.

It was unknown whether it was because of his formidable aura or he had obtained the inheritance of Wu Ji.

In short, Qin Yu’s dao mind was clearly unstable at this moment, and his battle intent was unclear.

However, Wu Ji was not like Qin Yu. Just as Qin Yu was stunned, Wu Ji’s palm suddenly reached out!

Wu Ji’s palm slowly stretched out as if extending from the distant universe. It emitted a mysterious light, like a moving star, which was soul-stirring.

This seemingly ordinary palm contained boundless profundity. It embodied both the essence of the dao technique and the gathering of battle intent, integrating Wu Ji’s power with wisdom.

The veins on the surface of the palm resembled the flowing rivers of the heavens and earth, ever-changing and elusive, making it difficult to grasp. The hidden energy fluctuations within carried a sense of solemn and ancient power.

In contrast, Wu Ji’s gaze was even colder and deeper, and he stared at his palm as if he could see through everything.

Qin Yu felt this tremendous pressure and was shocked. He knew that this palm contained the essence of Wu Ji, representing his ultimate realm in the dao technique and combat.

Wu Ji’s palm slowly pushed forward, and an invisible force began to spread. Space seemed torn apart by this power, and time stopped for a moment.

At this moment, the entire battlefield fell into silence, and only Wu Ji’s palm was still slowly advancing as if it had broken the barriers of time and space.

Wu Ji’s palm was getting increasingly closer to Qin Yu. Qin Yu could feel the power within getting increasingly stronger as if it could tear apart all obstacles.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s heart seemed to have stopped beating, sensing the internal qi of death. This palm strike was simple yet mysterious, unpredictable yet terrifying.

Wu Ji’s palm finally came into contact with Qin Yu’s body, and Qin Yu felt a powerful force transmitting over. This power was sharp and ancient as if it could completely crush him!

Before Qin Yu could regain his senses, that palm had already arrived in an instant!

“Bang!”

All the dao techniques gathered on this palm and instantly landed on Qin Yu’s body!

Qin Yu’s body was directly sent flying backward, and rays of light appeared on his body!

It was Wu Ji’s divine robe!

Without Wu Ji’s divine robe at this critical moment, Qin Yu would probably have died under this palm!

A single moment could determine victory or defeat in such a high-level battle. There must not be any distractions!

Qin Yu stood up from the ground and rubbed his chest. He felt his internal organs tremendously impacted, and it was unusually uncomfortable.

Not far away, Wu Ji was looking at Qin Yu coldly.

Looking at Wu Ji’s divine robe on Qin Yu’s body, his eyes seemed to flicker with hints of unusual colors as if he recalled something at that moment.

Seeing this gaze, Qin Yu was suddenly shocked in his heart again!

Could it be that this Wu Ji in front of him possessed a part of his real emotions and memories?

“Could it be… Wu Ji has transformed into the dao?” Qin Yu took a deep breath, and his eyes became increasingly solemn.

The Wu Ji in front of him was in his youth. His strength was similar to Qin Yu’s, and they were both about to enter the True Saint stage.

The cultivation methods of the two had something in common. They did not have too many fancy techniques, only the surging and pure battle intent!

“I’m a little excited.” Qin Yu’s eyes suddenly lit up.

To be able to fight with Wu Ji of the same era, what kind of honor was that?

Other than Qin Yu, who else in this world would have such an opportunity?

“Hahaha!”

Thinking of this, Qin Yu instantly laughed heartily. His gaze gradually became determined, and an intense battle intent suddenly surged from within.

“Senior Wu Ji, it’s Junior’s honor to be able to fight with you. Today, I humbly request that you grant me an exhilarating fight!” Qin Yu shouted.

The voice was filled with passion and pride as if it was stirring up the entire world.

On the other hand, Wu Ji’s gaze remained unchanged. He only looked at Qin Yu coldly, his gaze filled with cold battle intent.

At this moment, Wu Ji slowly raised his finger.

His finger pointed at Qin Yu, incredibly calm.

Qin Yu’s face revealed a solemn expression, not daring to show the slightest negligence.

He adjusted his internal qi to the extreme and activated the fighting word formula to the sixth level in an instant!

Faced with Wu Ji, Qin Yu dared not show the slightest negligence, let alone any reservation.

“Buzz!”

At this moment, Wu Ji’s divine robe on Qin Yu’s body suddenly flickered with a strange light. The next moment, Wu Ji’s divine robe on Qin Yu’s body disappeared.

Qin Yu was stunned, then he laughed heartily and said, “Alright, let’s have a fair battle!”

With that, Qin Yu no longer hesitated. His entire body erupted with Golden Light as he raised his hand and punched out the Ten Thousand Spell Breaking Punch!

This punch was the ultimate fusion of the dao technique and battle intent. There was no support by fancy techniques but only invincible physical body and battle intent!

A cold light flashed across Wu Ji’s eyes. He raised his palm lightly and collided with Qin Yu’s fist.
