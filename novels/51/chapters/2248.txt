2249 The Fire Unicorn

Wu Ji’s robe was a magical artifact from the previous century, and many of its materials were ancient minerals.

“This won’t do. If this continues, I’m afraid my Saint Weapon spoon won’t be able to melt this robe.”

Drops of sweat the size of soybeans continuously slid down from Suo Lin’s temple.

“Is there any other way, Master Suo Lin?”

Qin Yu’s expression was a little ugly. The refining had started.

If they failed, it would mean these magical artifacts would be scrapped.

“The only way now is to use the lava from the center of the earth for refining, but the temperature is too terrifying. I’m afraid even Saint Weapon would likely melt in an instant.”

Suo Lin said with a solemn expression.

“What? You want someone to draw out lava from the depths of the earth, which means entering into that lava! That’s just courting death.”

The man with the mustache was stunned.

“There’s no other way. Otherwise, we can only give up,” Suo Lin said with a bitter smile.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He was really unwilling to give up on Wu Ji’s robe just like that.

The Saintly Body Technique suddenly circulated, and the chaotic energy frantically transferred into his skin.

He then stomped his feet and arrived at the very center of the lava.

Columns of fire suddenly spewed forth one after another, and the terrifying temperature made Qin Yu feel a little suffocated.

“Phew!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Qin Yu took a deep breath and punched hard at the lava.

However, that force only stirred up some lava on the surface but not the lava in the depths.

“Qin Yu, catch this. Use this spoon to draw the underground lava into this furnace. Remember, you only have one chance! Otherwise, this spoon will melt!”

Suo Lin threw his Saint Weapon over.

Qin Yu caught it and dived into the lava like an arrow without hesitation.

Qin Yu endured the suffocating high temperature. The life force that Little Ginseng and Xiaoru usually emitted in the Sumeu ring was frantically injected into his body. At this moment, Little Ginseng and Xiaoru could also feel the danger of Qin Yu.

It was almost time!

When Qin Yu felt close to his limit, he fiercely threw up the spoon in his hand.

A massive stream of lava rushed up like a fire dragon, and the terrifying temperature instantly increased by dozens of degrees.

Being guided by the Saint Weapon spoon, the fire dragon fiercely injected into the furnace.

Wang Feng and the man with the mustache retreated a thousand meters away before they could barely endure the temperature.

Suo Lin’s face was red as if he had drunk ten pounds of hard liquor.

Wu Ji’s robe finally melted under the bashing by the lava.

“Great!”

Suo Lin waved his fist excitedly and injected spiritual power into several places of the furnace.

The lava inside was boosted instantly and burned even more vigorously, and the melting speed of the robe slowly increased.

“Where’s Qin Yu?”

The man with the mustache suddenly realized something wrong. Qin Yu had not come out of the lava yet.

“Did he melt inside?”

Wang Feng’s face turned pale.

Qin Yu was currently in the lava and dared not move at all.

After stirring the underground lava just now, he felt a ferocious beast wake up in the depths.

Even in the lava tens of thousands of degrees, Qin Yu felt cold sweat flowing down his back.

He could only feel a fierce and hostile aura locking onto him, causing every pore in his body to emit slight tremors.

It was the sixth sense of extreme danger!

That feeling was as pale and powerless as facing the power of the Path of Heaven. Even when he was facing Menn’s sword, his body had never felt this way.

He could only remain motionless at this moment, hoping the awakened beast would not notice him.

Xiaoru and Little Ginseng in the Sumeru ring were ashen and started to feel taxing.

As he separated the molten ore and the liquid gold from the refined magical artifacts to one side, he used the underground lava drawn by Qinn Yu to pour over Wu Ji’s robe.

Finally, Wu Ji’s robe completely melted.

Suo Lin channeled the liquid gold into the mold and then frantically swung the hammer to hit the magical artifact.

The shape of a boxing glove slowly formed, and Suo Lin swung his giant hammer.

Under the bombardment, the impurities slowly squeezed out.

In the sky above the Fire Unicorn Continent, the sky seemed to have some changes.

“It could actually cause a change in heaven and earth! As expected of Master Suo Lin. It should be an existence that surpassed a Saint Weapon.”

“Senior Brother, these few people seem to have average cultivation levels.”

A young man whispered into Nangong Qi’s ear.

“No rush. Let’s observe it for a while. Forget it if it was an ordinary tribulation magical artifact. It was not worth offending Suo Lin.”

The loud noise attracted Nangong Qi and the others. The cultivators nearby also came over to watch Suo Lin refining.

“It’s not easy to deal with. There are so many people, and most of them have ill intentions.”

The man with the mustache looked a little gloomy.

“If I had set it up in advance, I might have been able to set up a formation to hide such a massive fluctuation. It’s too late now. It’s going to be troublesome!”

Wang Feng looked a little terrified. These were all genuine True Saint cultivators.

Those who came here to refine artifacts were basically the strongest teams. After all, everyone was afraid of being killed and robbed of their precious magical artifacts.

“What a headache. Qin Yu probably encountered some trouble as well. He hasn’t gotten up yet, and there are so many people around.”

The man with the mustache’s expression was very ugly. He did not expect the refining this time to be so complicated.

At this moment, Qin Yu used the Spiritualization Technique, and the enormous power of the soul transformed into a giant hand wrapping around his body.

Even though he dared not move, things did not move in the right direction.

The divine sense became increasingly intense, and the terrifying divine sense fluctuations became even more active. The underground beast seemed to have woken up.

The lava hit Qin Yu’s body like a hammer. At this moment, the impurities in his bones, skin, and internal organs were being refined unconsciously.

However, Qin Yu was not in the mood to care about this at the moment. He clearly knew that any of his movements might cause the thing underground to attack.

He did not know what that thing was. His divine sense could not penetrate the terrifyingly hot lava.

While Qin Yu was unaware, the demonic egg suddenly ran out of the Sumeru ring.

It seemed to enjoy the high temperature of tens of thousands of degrees, rolling in the lava.

“No, if this continues, I’m afraid I really can’t get out of here.”

Qin Yu’s face was ashen.
