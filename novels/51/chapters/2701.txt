Chapter 2702: The Strange Buddha Statue

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The surrounding people were all very fearful. The main reason was that this statue was too peculiar.

Even Lord Tang, who had always been calm, could not help but be shocked when he saw the statue.

This was a peculiar Buddha statue. No matter how one looked at it, it would show a strange smile to the person.

There were also two temple blocks, one black and one white, under the Buddha statue. The two temple blocks were spinning at a plodding speed.

When everyone walked in to observe, they realized that the Buddha statue was made up of countless hideous babies.

The overlapping of all kinds of patterns created such a strange Buddha statue.

Moreover, there was a level of black internal qi around the Buddha statue although it was a few hundred meters away.

Lord Tang, Hong Luan, and Yi Yun felt an unparalleled coldness.

The Buddha statue sensed his internal qi when Lord Tang used his divine sense to investigate,

The cold internal qi suddenly invaded his sea of consciousness, causing all the defensive magical artifacts on his body to be ineffective.

Cold sweat dripped down from his temples. At this moment, a shadow of another world appeared in front of him.

The original Endless Mine had disappeared. In front of him were endless living beings walking slowly.

These living beings were all wearing white masks, so it was impossible to see their faces.

The scene here was extremely strange.

There were green rivers, red soil, various swamps, and dark buildings.

However, these scenes would repeat themselves every once in a while. There were no mistakes at all. Even the patterns on the walls were the same.

They continued on the same path. At this moment, Lord Tang appeared in the middle.

It was as if the people around him could not see him as they kept passing him.

“Lord Tang!”

The expressions of the two other people changed as they sensed something strange.

At this moment, Lord Tang’s internal qi was dropping rapidly, just like the aura of a dying old man.

Suddenly, a talisman appeared on Lord Tang’s body and burst into flames.

“Three Yang Divine Talisman! ” Yi Yun’s expression changed drastically. “What is the Three Yang Divine Talisman?”

Hong Luan didn’t seem to know this talisman.

“This is a top-notch divine talisman. It uses dragon skin as the talisman paper and phoenix blood as the characters to draw three Yang flames. It can light up the Yang Flames of the three souls and release a hundred times the power of the divine soul. Even in the entire Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom, there aren’t many of these talismans. I’m afraid Lord Tang is in big trouble.”

Yi Yun’s expression turned ugly.

“Everyone, don’t use your divine souls to investigate this Buddha statue! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Otherwise, your life will be in danger!”

At this moment, under the effect of the Three Yang Divine Talisman, the three divine soul Yang flames lit up.

A scorching divine soul power was emitted from his body, and his breath carried incomparably scorching Yang qi.

Chi!

His body trembled violently, and he finally pulled himself back from the strange scene.

After the divine talisman burned out, the internal qi on his body suddenly became extremely low.

“The Nineteenth Prison! Why would such a formation appear here? Hurry up and inform the higher-ups to come here. I’m afraid there will be a huge change in the Endless Mine!”

Lord Tang’s voice trembled.

Hearing that it was The Nineteenth Prison, the expressions of the two people beside him changed drastically.

“It’s too late. We can’t get out of the Endless Mine. We can’t use any communication talisman either. This space has been completely sealed.”

Hong Luan smiled bitterly. She had already sent a message to the people of the Upper Dome.

However, no matter how much holy energy she poured in, the talisman in her hand was useless. There was no reaction at all.

“Lord Tang, something happened! From the beginning, many people seemed to have gone crazy. We were attacked crazily when we approached them!”

A young man ran over with a pale face. Perhaps he was too afraid, his body trembled as he spoke.

“Ignore them. Everyone, come to the Xun seat. The baleful aura here is the weakest. We can only wish that the sect will find this out as soon as possible. We can’t solve it with our strength. Lord Zhou will be here soon. We will be safe as long as we hold on until Lord Zhou arrives.”

Lord Tang’s face was pale. He ignored everyone else and walked toward the Xun seat.

Hong Luan and Yi Yun followed closely behind. Their faces were filled with shock.

They didn’t know much about The Nineteenth Prison, but they could feel the seriousness of the situation from Lord Tang’s words.

At this moment, Qin Yu and Xi Ming were still trying to find out what was going on underground.

However, they went to a few contact points in a row and found that those people were the same as the people before them. They had lost all internal qi of life.

“Something is wrong here. We have to leave as soon as possible.”

Xi Ming’s face was pale.

It wasn’t that there weren’t any experts. Two experts were similar to him and had reached Dao Realm level 5. However, they still ended up like the others.

Moreover, there was no fighting scene at all. This made his hair stand on end.

Qin Yu’s face was covered in cold sweat. He felt his weight increase since the holy energy had started to drain.

This kind of power made him feel tired.

“The power of the second Heart of Saint Kingdom has been lost outside the kingdom. It seems that the order here has collapsed. We have to retreat quickly!”

Qin Yu analyzed and found that this situation was like the Demon Sealing Valley.

After the loss of the Saint Power, all the seals on the ancient demons were broken. It was very likely that some kind of change had occurred here. “There’s a teleportation formation at the next contact point. We’ll leave from there.”

Xi Ming left quickly. The strange scene here made him not want to stay any longer.

Qin Yu squatted down and let the little boy lie on his back, then quickly followed Xi Ming.

“There’s a teleportation formation here! Why didn’t I see this at the contact points earlier?”

Qin Yu caught up to Xi Ming and asked curiously.

“Not every contact point has a teleportation formation. It’s not a traditional teleportation portal either. It’s a transmission channel used to transport ores and replace people. Holy energy swirls around this underground mine, and the foundation is sturdy. It’s impossible to set up a normal spatial teleportation formation.”

Xi Ming hesitated for a moment but still explained to Qin Yu.

Soon, they arrived at the next contact point. Qin Yu suddenly stopped ten meters away.

“Be careful. I think I can sense an internal qi. There’s someone alive in this house.”

Xi Ming pointed his finger. Fire elements gathered on his hand, blasting the house open.

A tall and burly man revealed half of his face at the door.

“Tu Ku, why didn’t you reply to the sect’s message talisman?”

Xi Ming seemed to know the person in front of him. He put away the vigilance on his face..
