Chapter 1487: Chapter 1,487, the intruder is not kind

Hearing Jue Wu’s voice, Wen Da and Wen er hurriedly shut their mouths, not daring to joke about Jue Wu anymore.

In a short while, Jue Wu arrived here.

She sat down, grabbed the wine on the table, and began to drink.

“Has Qin Yu Not Come Out Yet?”Jue Wu asked.

Wen Da and Wen Er hurriedly shook their heads and said, “No, it’s just that his face is red from holding it in every day, and his head is full of sweat.”

“Covered in sweat?”Jue Wu frowned slightly. She put down the wine in her hand and then walked toward the cultivation room.

Wen Da and Wen Er followed closely behind, and the three of them went all the way to the cultivation room.

As soon as they arrived at the cultivation room, they saw that Qin Yu’s entire body was trembling.

“Look, it’s just like this,”Wen da hurriedly said.

Jue Wu wrinkled her small qiong nose. She looked around and quickly noticed the problem.

“Is this kid throwing his life away for cultivation?”Jue Wu muttered.

She walked behind Qin Yu and raised her small palm. An internal Qi gathered in her hand.

Then, Jue Wu slapped Qin Yu’s back.

In an instant, the internal Qi in Qin Yu’s body gradually stabilized.

His entire body felt a warm current, which was extremely comfortable.

His trembling body stopped at this moment, and the expression on his face gradually became relaxed.

Seeing this scene, Wen Da and Wen Er could not help but be shocked.

“Aunt Jue Wu, this... What’s going on with this kid?”Wen Da asked.

Jue Wu opened her mouth and was about to explain, but then she muttered, “What’s there to explain to the two of you? You won’t understand even if I tell you.”

After saying this, Jue Wu quickly rushed to the pavilion.

There was already good wine and food prepared here. Jue Wu rushed over and began to gobble down the food.

When Wen Da and Wen Er saw this, they also quickly followed.

The group of people ate, drank, and had fun from day to night.

“Come on, continue!”Jue Wu clearly didn’t want to finish.

Wen Da and Wen Er were already done for. The two of them lay on the ground, staggering.

“Two trash.”Jue Wu rolled her eyes. At this moment, she looked at the two attendants.

“Come, you two drink with me!”Jue Wu waved her small hands and said.

The two of them hurriedly waved their hands and said, “Lord Jue Wu, we... We don’t know how to drink...”

“There’s nothing to be afraid of. After drinking two times, we will know how to drink.”Jue Wu did not say anything and pulled the two of them to sit down.

At the same time, in Eternal City.

The black-robed man and Mister Yong Ji were sitting opposite each other. A pot of wine was placed in front of them.

“If you have something to say, just say it.”Yong Ji took a sip of wine and smiled.

The black-robed man smiled faintly and said, “Then I’ll get straight to the point.”

The black-robed man raised his head to look at Yong Ji and said, “Mister Yong Ji, I wonder if I can trouble you to kill someone.”

“Kill someone? hahaha! Do you need my help with something like this?”Yong Ji shook his head.

The black-robed man narrowed his eyes and said, “The person I want you to kill is not someone else. It’s the unique dance of Mount Hua Ning.”

Once these words were said, Yong Ji’s expression changed slightly.

“Unique dance?”The wine cup in Yong Ji’s hand froze in midair.

The black-robed man nodded slightly and said, “That’s right. We’ve heard that unique dance’s ability is unparalleled in the world. Other than Mister Yong Ji, we can’t find a more suitable candidate.”

Yong Ji furrowed his brows tightly and said coldly, “If I help your Northland fight against the absolute dance, how am I going to live if this gets out?”

The black-robed man laughed loudly and said, “Mister Yong Ji, don’t worry. We’ll use a secret technique to cover your face. No one will ever find out that the person who attacked is you.”

Yong Ji remained silent and said in a deep voice, “You can just find someone else for such a matter. Why do you need to find me?”

“Other than you, we can’t think of a more suitable candidate,”the black-robed man said.

“Mr. Yong Ji, are you afraid of that crazy woman?”The black-robed man raised his eyebrows and asked.

Yong Ji laughed loudly and said, “I’m not afraid. I just feel that there’s no need to offend Jue Wu for the sake of your Northland. This is a loss-making deal.”

The black-robed man shook the wine cup in his hand and said indifferently, “Whatever conditions you have, just mention them.”

Yong Ji narrowed his eyes slightly and said, “Really?”

“Absolutely.”The black-robed man nodded and said.

Yong Ji’s expression turned cold as he said coldly, “I want you to help me kill the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect.”

As soon as these words were said, the black-robed man’s expression immediately changed.

“Kill the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect? This is not an easy matter.”The black-robed man’s voice became somewhat cold.

Yong Ji smiled faintly and said, “I didn’t ask you to kill him now. You can just kill him in the future.”

“I believe that it won’t be long before the north and the South region will start an all-out war. You’ll have to kill him sooner or later.”Yong Ji smiled and said.

The black-robed man smiled but didn’t say anything. A moment later, he suddenly asked, “Why didn’t you do it yourself?”

Yong ji sneered and said, “If I were his opponent, how could I have tolerated it until now?”

At this point, Yong Ji swept his gaze around and said coldly, “I have more than a hundred people under me. Every one of them is a heaven’s favorite. They are definitely not inferior to the Heavenly Cloud Sect!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“If it weren’t for the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, I would have made my move long ago.”

“Even you are not his opponent?”The black-robed man could not help but be a little surprised.

Yong ji nodded and said, “I’m most likely unable to defeat him.”

The black-robed man thought for a moment and said, “Alright, but I don’t dare to promise you when it will be realized.”

Yong Ji narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “Sooner or later, you will have a battle with the Heavenly Cloud Sect. At that time, our Yong Ji City will also attack together.”

“So, strictly speaking, you are not helping me. We are just helping each other.”Yong Ji looked at the black-robed man.

The black-robed man seemed to think that what he said made sense. He immediately smiled and said, “Deal. We’ll set off in three days.”

The two of them hit it off and planned to suppress Jue Wu!

At this moment, Jue Wu had no idea that she had been targeted by someone.

She was drunk all day long and lived quite happily.

Other than taking a look at Qin Yu every day, she ate almost all the other time.

In the blink of an eye, two days had passed.

And there were only ten nascent soul pills left in Qin Yu’s hand.

He opened his eyes and looked at the nascent soul pills in his hand, intending to swallow them all in one go.

Just as he was about to swallow all ten nascent soul pills into his stomach, a pale golden light suddenly shot over.

This light was like a whip, grabbing Qin Yu’s wrist.

“What?”Qin Yu looked at Jue Wu.

Jue Wu glared at Qin Yu and said, “If it wasn’t for me, you would probably be dead by now!”

“Even if you’re cultivating, you can’t fight so hard, understand?”Jue Wu muttered as he walked.

Qin Yu scratched his head and said, “Ten pills shouldn’t be a problem. After I finish absorbing these ten pills, it should be enough.”

“Internal Qi?”Jue Wu opened her mouth and was about to speak when she suddenly felt several auras appear near Mount Hua Ning.

“Eh?”Jue Wu immediately frowned.

Soon, Qin Yu also sensed this aura.

“Someone is coming?”Qin Yu stood up and said.

A trace of coldness flashed in Jue Wu’s big eyes as she slowly said, “It’s not a friendly visit.”
