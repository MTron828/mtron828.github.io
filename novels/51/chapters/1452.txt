Chapter 1453: Chapter 1,453: One Punch, one blow

Qin Yu and sister Lin sat on the back of the huge godly eagle and flew high in the sky.

Their destination was the palace of Gu City.

...

In the palace.

Many subordinates were surrounding the city lord.

“Qin Yu is in Gu city now. Should we do something?”

“Yes, if we capture Qin Yu and send him back to the heavenly cloud sect, it would be a great merit!”

The city Lord’s expression turned gloomy when he heard that.

Not long ago, Qin Yu had just defeated the first elder, and then Jue Wu had beaten the first elder half to death.

The current Qin Yu was no longer a popular person, but a hot potato.

The people around were chattering, and the city lord’s words annoyed everyone.

He berated, “Alright, stop talking!”

The crowd immediately fell silent, and no one spoke.

The city lord swept his gaze across the crowd and said coldly, “From now on, everyone will pretend that they haven’t seen Qin Yu. Do you understand?”

“AH? Why is that?”Someone asked.

The city Lord looked at him coldly and said, “I don’t Think You’re suitable for your current position. Your Brain should be guarding the city gates.”

The moment he said that, everyone’s expression changed slightly.

For a moment, no one dared to say anything more.

However, there were some troubles that could not be escaped.

Even if you didn’t look for it, he would still come.

Just as they were discussing, a huge divine hawk directly passed through the defenses of the Gu City Palace and landed directly.

Before everyone was shocked, Qin Yu jumped down from the Divine Hawk with sister Lin.

“You... Why did you bring me here?”Sister Lin said with some fear.

Qin Yu glanced at the surroundings and said, “I have investigated the entire GU city. This is the best location. The scenery is beautiful and the spiritual energy is dense.”

“This... This is the city lord’s residence...”sister Lin couldn’t understand Qin Yu.

She didn’t know what had happened during this period of time, so she naturally didn’t know how afraid the City Lord was of Qin Yu.

Qin Yu pulled sister Lin and Strode into the palace.

The city Lord’s face was ashen. He looked at Qin Yu who was walking over and wanted to curse in his heart.

Although he was afraid of Qin Yu in his heart, he was after all eating the food of the heavenly cloud sect, so he could only feign anger and say, “Qin Yu, what are you doing here!”

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “You better stop shouting at me. I remember clearly what you did to me previously.”

The city Lord’s expression changed drastically. He didn’t Expect Qin Yu to not give him any face at all!

“Qin Yu! Do you think I’m afraid of You? !”The city Lord flew into a rage and stood up angrily!

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “Aren’t you afraid?”

The city lord secretly gnashed his teeth. Just as he opened his mouth to speak, he was interrupted by Qin Yu.

“I know that the strongest thing in Gu City is the mountain protection array of this city. But according to what I know, this mountain protection array can only defend against external enemies. Once it enters Gu City, it will lose its effectiveness, right?”Qin Yu mocked.

The city Lord glared at Qin Yu and said, “Do you think that this is the only mountain protection formation in Gu City? You underestimate me too much!”

Qin Yu looked at the city lord coldly and said, “Is that so? What else do you have? Show me.”

As the city Lord of Gu City, he naturally would not give in so easily.

“Since you are courting death, then don’t blame me for being impolite!”The city Lord of Gu City said with a dark face.

He raised both of his hands and instantly emitted several rays of light from the surroundings of the palace. Strands of killing intent rushed towards him!

This was a killing formation! It was personally set up by the people of the Heavenly Cloud sect. Its purpose was to protect the city lord!

Strands of light weaved into a huge net in the void.

This net blotted out the sky and covered the Sun. Its imposing manner was magnificent, as if it was a huge cloud!

“Qin Yu, it’s still not too late for you to SCRAM NOW!”The city Lord said coldly.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Didn’t you always want to capture me? Why are you chasing me away now?”

Seeing this scene, sister Lin hurriedly said, “Qin Yu, let’s hurry up and leave!”

Qin Yu ignored sister Lin. He raised his head and stared at this killing formation. He sneered and said, “What bullshit killing formation? This killing formation is set up like a pile of shit. You Don’t even need to find the core of the formation.”

“Arrogant! Die!”

The city lord couldn’t hold it in any longer. After he shouted, the killing array in the sky immediately rushed towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and golden light erupted from his body.

His fist contained extremely powerful power. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

This was the absolute beginning holy fist! He raised his hand and unleashed the unparalleled power of the absolute beginning holy fist!

He rose up from the ground like a golden meteorite that was going against the trend. He charged forward with a crushing force!

“Boom!”

A loud sound exploded in the palace!

The sky seemed to have blossomed with brilliant fireworks, attracting the attention of countless people.

And that terrifying power was rapidly surging in all directions!

In less than half a second, the killing formation in the sky directly exploded!

And in the depths of the palace, a crisp cracking sound spread out!

This sound was precisely the sound of the formation’s eye shattering!

Qin Yu landed on the ground, and the surroundings slowly became quiet.

Qin Yu looked at the city lord coldly and said, “If it wasn’t for the fact that your palace is still useful, that punch just now would have flattened this place.”
