2264 The Strongest Combat Strength

Qin Yu searched through the memories of the disciples of the Mysterious Dark Sect. After putting away the warship, he arrived in front of the sect almost instantly.

On a massive stone door, various demonic beasts were carved on it. Three large words were written in the blood of demonic beasts, “Mysterious Dark Sect”.

“It’s quite imposing.”

Qin Yu kicked the massive stone door into numerous pieces.

“How dare you! Who dares to barge into our Mysterious Dark Sect?”

Seven or eight disciples of the Mysterious Dark Sect surrounded Qin Yu.

“A mere fourth-grade True Saint dares to be so arrogant? Take him down and break his legs!”

The leader sneered and said.

Two persons leaped and arrived before Qin Yu. Their hands vibrated with massive spiritual power as they instantly grabbed Qin Yu’s shoulders on the left and right, wanting to cripple him.

“Crack!”

Qin Yu did not avoid the massive vibration and allowed the two hands to pat his shoulders.

The tremendous rebound force directly broke the arms of those two people. Qin Yu’s shoulders shook, and a terrifying force transmitted to the two people and shattered their internal organs and souls directly. Their corpses instantly smashed onto the ground, turning into a pile of blood mist.

“What? You’re that Qin Yu?”

The leader’s expression changed drastically, and he crushed a transmission jade slip.

“That brat is here.”

Shui Yuan’s expression changed drastically.

“Haha, you’re the leader of a sect but are frightened by a mere fourth-grade kid. How can you continue to lead your disciples in the future?”

A slightly sharp voice rang out. It was none other than the Blood Sect’s young lord, Zong Yue, who had a grudge against Qin Yu.

Beside him were three elderly men with unfathomable auras, the three most powerful elders of the Blood Sect. They were three brothers Mu Yu, Mu Tian, and Mu Fan. These three had been recruited by the sect master of the Blood Sect, Zong Yu since they were young. They were cultivators of the same generation as Zong Yu and had unfathomable strength.

This time, after receiving the request for help from the Mysterious Dark Sect, Zong Yu sent the three brothers and Zong Yue over. This matter was indeed very important to him.

“This kid isn’t simple. He killed dozens of people in one move on the Fire Unicorn Continent. Sect Master and I were also heavily injured. Don’t take him lightly.”

Nangong Qi by the side hurriedly said.

“It’s merely trash killing trash.”

Sitting on the back of a True Saint cultivator with his legs raised, Zong Yue sneered and said.

“You!”

Nangong Qi wanted to say something but was stopped by Shui Yuan.

“Don’t worry, Sect Master Gu Ming. Since we agreed to help, we’ll ensure he doesn’t dare to act recklessly.”

In a corner of the hall, Xing Mou chuckled and said.

They had also received a request for help from Gu Ming. After accepting a generous reward, the Edgeless Team also agreed to come and stop Qin Yu. In their opinion, even if Qin Yu obtained a divine artifact, they had nothing to fear.

In other places, there were also a group of powerful people that Gu Ming highly paid to come over. These were all famous teams in purgatory who had lived in the purgatory for countless years and were all powerful cultivators.

He had the same thoughts as Qin Yu. It was fine as long as he could protect the sect.

As for the land of resources and Mystic Realm that were relatively far away, they could not be defended at all.

“Elder Gu Ming, it’s good that you remember your promise. You’ll have to take care of the seventh level of the Mystic Realm when the time comes.”

Zong Yue sneered and said.

“Since I vowed on the Path of Heaven, I will definitely make it. However, the Blood Sect must remember my spot,” Gu Ming said with a frown.

“Yes, of course. There are ten spots in the Mystic Realm this time, and I’ve already reserved one for you.”

Zong Yue said indifferently, looking like a distinguished guest.

Hmm? It turned out to be the seventh level of the Mystic Realm. Previously, Wang Feng was captured by the two elders of the Blood Sect into the seventh level of the Mystic Realm.

Moreover, the man with the mustache seemed to have plans for this Mystic Realm. Did the Blood Sect already have a direction?

Qin Yu killed his way in. Wherever he went, he directly killed those who dared to attack.

However, most of the cultivators of the Mysterious Dark Sect had received voice transmission from their sect master to allow Qin Yu to come to the peak of the Mysterious Dark Sect. Only a few people were blind enough to see that Qin Yu was only a fourth-grade cultivator and wanted to kill him to get the reward.

Qin Yu directly kicked the sect protection formation and stepped into the main hall.

“Hehe, what an arrogant Holy Region cultivator.”

Zong Yue sneered and said.

Dozens of powerful internal qi instantly locked onto Qin Yu’s body. He frowned slightly.

This Shui Yuan was really smart. He knew he wouldn’t let him off so easily, and he actually hired such massive helpers in such a short time.

“Qin Yu, I’ve just received news from the Moon Listening Pavilion that the sect master of the Blood Sect has a hidden technique and has once killed a Peak ninth-grade cultivator. Unless it’s absolutely necessary, don’t get into a conflict with the Blood Sect.”

Piao Ruoyun’s jade slip transmitted into his ears.

“Everyone, I’m only targeting the Mysterious Dark Sect. It has nothing to do with you.”

Qin Yu said with a frown.

“We’re here, and do you think it has nothing to do with us?”

Xing Mou said with a smile.

“Give me a reason. I can choose not to make a move if I find it pleasing to the ear,” Zong Yue said with a sinister smile.

“The reason is simple. While we might not have any significant grudges, I and Shui Yuan have an irreconcilable enmity. It’s a matter of either you die or I live.”

Qin Yu said with a smile.

“Speak louder. I didn’t hear you.” Zong Yue dug his ears.

“Hehe, a trash who bullies the weak and fears the strong.”

Seeing Qin Yu’s behavior, Wu Feng smirked coldly at the corner of his mouth.

“Haha, Qin Yu, why aren’t you arrogant anymore?”

Nangong Qi laughed wildly. Seeing Qin Yu show signs of submission, he was very pleased. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Qin Yu, don’t think that just because you have a divine weapon, you can consider yourself invincible. There are plenty of people who can deal with you.” Shui Yuan sneered and stood up.

These people were the top cultivators in purgatory. Gu Ming was finally relieved that they were here to guard the place.

“Forget it. It’s boring. I thought you could be a little bit tougher, and I’ll play with you. You’re like a dog, and I don’t even have the mood to accompany you. Hand over your divine artifact, and I’ll let you leave this place alive.”

Zong Yue shook his head in disappointment.

“Kneel before me.”

Nangong Qi kicked Qin Yu’s knee directly.

“Ah!”

He let out a miserable cry. Qin Yu’s knees did not move at all. Instead, he was the one who was shaken until his bones cracked and almost fell to the ground.

“Brat, you are playing with fire.”

Xing Mou said coldly as an arrow was aimed at him.

A few divine senses were also locked onto him. If Qin Yu made a slight move, they would attack.

“I hope you can resist like a man.”

Zong Yue sneered and said.

“As you wish.”

Qin Yu suddenly said.

His figure suddenly disappeared, and his entire body was as fast as an afterimage. His body arrived before Zong Yue, and he slapped out.

“How dare you!”

Mu Yu attacked coldly. His terrifying internal qi shattered the void and directly blocked the direction of Qin Yu’s palm.
