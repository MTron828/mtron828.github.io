1839 Stepping into the Reversion Void Stage

At this place, it seemed that only Qin Yu was the real dao technique!

The so-called Path of Heaven could not do anything in the world of consciousness!

The thunder man slowly disappeared and turned into fragments of the dao technique, all of which were integrated into Qin Yu’s profound world.

At this moment, everything had returned to normal.

In this profound world, Qin Yu could still do everything. He could get almost everything he wanted, even make a stone become a top-notch martial artist in the Mighty Realm!

However, Qin Yu soon noticed that something was wrong.

He only felt a chill down his back, as if he had sensed something terrible!

In this profound world, Qin Yu was like playing the role of Path of Heaven. He could do whatever he wanted and have everything he wanted.

In other words, was the Path of Heaven the same in the real world of cultivation?

If he really had his own consciousness, could he change everything with a single thought?

It was unimaginable!

“Path of Heaven… It’s probably just a consciousness, a law, and not a person,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Otherwise, the so-called Immortal Emperor would never have appeared because before the Immortal Emperor appeared, the Path of Heaven could make one disappear with a thought or even make one never appear in this world.

Just as Qin Yu was deep in thought, a figure suddenly appeared in front of him.

The figure only flashed by, but it still could not escape Qin Yu’s eyes!

“Just now… That figure just now…” Qin Yu swallowed his saliva, and a look of disbelief flashed across his face.

It was because the figure just now was extremely familiar. It was none other than Qin Yu himself!

However, in Qin Yu’s world, how could there be another Qin Yu?

“Do you think you’re invincible?”

At this moment, a familiar voice was heard.

The familiar voice belonged to Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s body suddenly tensed up. He hurriedly looked up and saw a person who looked exactly like him standing in front of him!

What was different from Qin Yu was that his face was full of evil and coldness, and the killing intent on his body made people feel like he came from hell!

“Hell, Satan!” Qin Yu suddenly thought of something!

The other Qin Yu also sneered and said, “You think you can suppress me?”

Qin Yu’s face turned even uglier after hearing this!

Sure enough, just as Qin Yu had thought, this “Qin Yu” in front of him was probably related to Satan!

“In this world… You and I… are the same. You and I share this spiritual world!” The other Qin Yu’s voice was bone-chilling, causing Qin Yu to feel chilly all over!

Qin Yu hurriedly tried to use his divine sense to make the other Qin Yu in front of him disappear, but it was of no use!

That was to say, in this world, the two Qin Yus had the same ability!

“D*mn it!”

It immediately caused Qin Yu’s expression to change drastically. If this Qin Yu in front of him were to attack him, he would definitely fail this tribulation!

“I’m the real Qin Yu. You can’t suppress me…” at this moment, that Qin Yu spoke.

As he spoke, a cold and terrifying smile appeared on his face again. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

As the voice rang out, Qin Yu’s figure began to disappear gradually until it was completely gone.

Qin Yu’s face was covered in sweat. He suddenly opened his eyes, only to find out he had recovered his true body. Everything was like a dream, and it was extremely unreal.

He lowered his head and still saw traces of wounds on his body.

The powerful energy in his body also indicated that he had successfully broken through and stepped into the Reversion Void stage.

“It seems like… that wasn’t a dream.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

Qin Yu should have been excited, but at this moment, he felt a chill down his spine and it was extremely terrifying.

The appearance of the other Qin Yu made him feel extremely uneasy.

“Could it be that all of this is related to Satan…” Qin Yu murmured, and he was lost for a moment.

Qin Yu did not dare to imagine what the so-called replacement meant!

After sitting there for a long time, Qin Yu seemed to be fallen into deep thought.

He tried to use his divine sense to find the other Qin Yu but failed. Everything was like a dream as if there was no other Qin Yu at all.

However, all the signs indicated that everything that had happened just now was real.

Time flew by. In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu had been sitting there for two days.

However, Qin Yu couldn’t figure it out. He couldn’t figure out where the other Qin Yu had come from and why he had appeared.

It was an answer that Qin Yu couldn’t find at the moment. It was as if he had gone to a dead end, and he couldn’t get out at all.

After a full six days, Qin Yu’s state of mind finally calmed down slowly as if he was slowly accepting the fact.

Obviously, the answer was unknown. It was an answer that would take a long time to find.

Therefore, Qin Yu stopped thinking about it.

He slowly got up and tried to feel the surging and terrifying spiritual power in his body.

His powerful internal qi made Qin Yu full of confidence.

“I’ve finally stepped into the Reversion Void Stage.” Qin Yu opened his mouth, revealing his white teeth.

As long as he stepped into the Reversion Void stage, he would be able to head to Zhongzhou.

In the entire Holy Region, the Reversion Void Stage might not mean much. But in this cultivation realm, he was definitely one of the best among his peers.

There was no other reason other than the fact that before the golden age arrived, no one had the opportunity to enter the Reversion Void Sage, except for the powerful cultivators of the older generation.

Therefore, this level of cultivation realm already had the strength to compete with the current heaven’s favorites!

Just as Qin Yu was deep in thought…

The void in front of him suddenly trembled.

In the next second, he saw Dean Lei walk out of the void.

Qin Yu was surprised to see Dean Lei.

“Dean Lei, what brought you here?” he hurriedly bowed and said.

“If I didn’t come, how would you leave this immortal grave?” Dean Lei smiled faintly and said.

Qin Yu was surprised. “Dean Lei, you… You know that I’ve already broken through?”

“Hahaha!” Dean Lei stroked his beard and laughed, but he did not answer the question. He reached out his palm and said with a faint smile, “Let’s go.”

Qin Yu didn’t dare to say anything else. He followed Dean Lei, stepped into the void, and left the immortal grave.

Soon, the two returned to the first main peak.

In Dean Lei’s dao lecture room, Qin Yu and Dean Lei were sitting opposite each other.

“Thank you, Dean Lei. Without your help, I don’t know how long it would have taken me to step into the Reversion Void Stage,” Qin Yu said sincerely.

“I’ve already said I’m doing this for your father’s sake,” Dean Lei said with a smile.

Despite what he said, Qin Yu’s heart was still filled with gratitude.

At this moment, Dean Lei suddenly changed the subject.

He said with a solemn expression, “I want to tell you something, but you have to keep your emotions in check.”
