Chapter 1565: Chapter 1,565, the Great War against Yongji! 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Yongji glared at Qin Yu. His anger filled his chest, almost making him lose his mind!

How could he not be angry when he was being beaten up in front of so many people!

“Qin Yu... You’re courting death! ! !”Yongji raised his head and roared, his voice shaking the sky!

However, in Qin Yu’s eyes, he was just a clown, unable to fly into a rage.

With the support of the fifth level of the fighting word formula, Qin Yu did not put Yong Ji in his eyes at all!

On the other side of the bank, Sima Bei’s expression became even colder. His expression was gloomy as he said in a low voice, “This child must not be allowed to live!”

“Lord Sima Bei, don’t worry. I have already sent people,”said the person beside him.

As he was speaking, a black-robed person suddenly appeared at the northern border.

He looked coldly at Qin Yu. His gaze was like a sharp blade, causing people to feel extremely uncomfortable.

“Whoosh!”

At this moment, the black-robed person suddenly attacked from behind. A sharp blade that was covered in green mist was aimed straight at Qin Yu’s neck!

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed slightly, and a golden light immediately appeared on his body!

The golden light was like a golden bowl, enveloping Qin Yu within.

......

“Clang!”

The sharp blade was sent flying the moment it came into contact with it.

“Whoosh!”

At this moment, Yong Ji also flew into a rage.

The two of them stood together, the murderous aura on their bodies overflowing to the heavens!

Qin Yu looked coldly at the two people in front of him and said, “Yong Ji, it seems that I have overestimated you, you trash.”

Yong Ji’s pupils suddenly constricted!

What? Trash?

He had been dominating the southern region for so many years, but this was the first time he had received such an evaluation!

“Kid, I’m going to kill you!”Yong Ji roared and raised his hand to use his trump card, the three elements holy palm!

The three elements holy palm was extremely powerful, and it was not the first time Qin Yu had faced it. However, this time, the caster was Yong Ji, and its power was extremely terrifying!

At the same time, the black-robed man beside him also moved.

He pointed his finger forward, and in an instant, a radiance that was as thick as a person’s embrace closed in on Qin Yu!

Qin Yu looked coldly at the spells of these two people. He clenched his fists, and Golden Light appeared. He raised his hand and broke the ten thousand spell breaking punch!

“Boom!”

Golden light pierced through the heaven and earth, illuminating the entire northern border!

The scorching temperature even affected the other side of the bank!

At this moment, the Dead River began to boil and roll up!

“Boom!”

Qin Yu’s Golden Fist, which was like the sun and moon, shattered the void and everything.

The Eternal Limit’s three Yuan sacred palm was not enough. It was shattered at the moment of contact!

Then, the huge finger was broken by a punch!

The black-robed man not far away immediately covered his finger. His finger was actually broken by the Impact!

“Swoosh!”

Qin Yu did not want to give them any chance to catch their breath. This was because morale was extremely important in such a big battle. This was also the reason why Qin Yu directly activated the fifth level of the fighting word formula!

Qin Yu stepped on the line word formula and instantly appeared in front of the black-robed man!

Then, Qin Yu clapped his hands and landed on his head!

A terrifying suction force followed. The black-robed man felt as if his body was being peeled off, and his body kept shrinking!

“What... What is going on!”

The black-robed man did not even know what happened. He only felt extreme pain.

In a moment, the black-robed man turned into a dried corpse.

And his spiritual power and primordial spirit had been absorbed into Qin Yu’s body! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Yong Ji’s eyes widened, as if he could not believe everything!

How Could Qin Yu have grown to such a level in just a few days? He even felt that Qin Yu was now above the three madmen and three uniques!

“I only have five minutes. I have to get rid of Yong Ji as soon as possible,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

The fifth level of the fighting word formula was extremely powerful, and the improvement it brought was beyond imagination.

However, the time was too short. After five minutes, Qin Yu would lose the support of the fighting word formula.

At that time, although he was not afraid of Yongji, it would not be so easy to kill him.

Yongji knew that things were not going well. He reached out with his hand and took out a long whip.

The long whip seemed to be burning with a fiery red color. Naturally, there was no need to say anything about its power.

“Go to hell!”

Yong Ji roared angrily and swung the long whip in his hand at Qin Yu!

Wherever the chain passed, everything was cut into two!

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold. He reached out with his hand and wanted to grab the chain.

However, the chain suddenly disappeared in the air! Before Qin Yu could regain his senses, the chain had already turned into a sea of fire and swallowed Qin Yu!

At a glance, Qin Yu was enveloped by a fireball. This fireball was exuding an extremely hot temperature. Even though they were far apart, they still felt that the heat was unbearable. There were even people who were directly burned into dregs!

Yong Ji did not stop there. He muttered, and a trace of blood essence floated out from between his brows.

Then, Yong Ji let out an explosive shout. A huge figure actually appeared behind him!

This figure was extremely terrifying, like a judge. That huge figure coupled with that terrifying face made it seem as if it had truly come from hell!

“Seal it!”

Yong Ji used all his strength and let out a loud shout. In an instant, his face turned a few shades paler!

It was very obvious that this spell was extremely pressuring to him!

The huge figure stretched out its hand, and the chains shot out from its sleeves, binding the fireball!

The huge hand of the heavens grabbed the chains and dragged the fireball, as if it wanted to drag it into hell!

“Hehe... You’re dead!”Yong Ji said weakly.

The fireball surged towards the body, as if everything was about to fall into a state of Nirvana!

“Qin Yu!”

The expressions of the surrounding crowd changed drastically! Even Xiao Hai wanted to lend Qin Yu a hand!

Inside the fireball, Qin Yu swung his fist to one side, but he found that the fireball could not be broken!

The entire fireball kept swaying left and right under Qin Yu’s smash, but it could not stop even half a step.

Yong ji sneered, “Once this technique is used, the moment the absolute dance stops, Qin Yu, I will bring you to hell!”

Inside the fireball, Qin Yu kept shouting loudly, and his fists kept smashing into the surroundings.

Just as Yong Ji had said, this fireball could not be broken! No matter how much strength Qin Yu had, it was useless!

“The three maniacs and three uniques indeed have their own trump cards.”Qin Yu’s expression was cold.

He closed his eyes slightly and muttered in a low voice. An even more resplendent golden light bloomed from his body!

“Buzz!”

A loud sound rang out, and the fireball began to shake violently!

In the next second, the huge body directly drilled through the fireball and shot into the sky!

Cosmic Form!

Under the cosmic form, there was practically nothing that could trap Qin Yu!

At this moment, Qin Yu was extremely huge. At a glance, he was on par with the judge that Yongji had summoned!

“HM?”Seeing this spell, Sima bei could not help but frown slightly.

He had a feeling that this spell looked somewhat familiar.

Looking at Qin Yu who had charged out of the fireball, Yong Ji laughed coldly.

“It’s useless. So what if you managed to escape? No one can escape this spell!”Yong Ji roared crazily!

Looking down, as expected, the chain was still tied to Qin Yu’s body!
