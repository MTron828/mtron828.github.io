Chapter 88: The Power of the Yan Family Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

When he saw this scene, Shen Tian’s expression changed drastically!

This... What the h*ll was this situation? Why were the people from the Chuzhou region here?

“People inside, listen up. You are surrounded! Put down your weapons!” A loud shout came from outside!

Surrounded? Put down your weapons?

What did this mean?

Shen Tian was dumbfounded. Why did it seem like they were going to kidnap him?

At this moment, Yan Yongxiu looked at Shen Yun and said indifferently, “Shen Yun, didn’t you want evidence? I’ll give you one now.”

“You kidnapped a Jingdu merchant and threatened him. Your crime is unforgivable,” Yan Yongxiu said coldly.

The Shen family’s father and son instantly understood!

Since they couldn’t find evidence of Yan Ruoxue’s kidnapping, then they would create another crime of kidnapping!

No one would be able to clear themselves of the accusation!

“You... you’re falsely incriminating me!” Shen Tian said anxiously.

“Falsely incriminating? Do you think they will believe me or you?” Yan Yongxiu said indifferently.

Shen Tian immediately became impatient, but he couldn’t think of any way to deal with it! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Shen Yun breathed a sigh of relief. It was better to be in prison than to be killed.

“Thank you for showing mercy, Mr. Yan...” Shen Yun knelt on the ground and kowtowed desperately.

“Shen Yun,” Yan Yongxiu called out coldly.

Shen Yun hurriedly raised his head and looked at Yan Yongxiu.

“I’m giving you a chance now,” Yan Yongxiu said indifferently.

“As long as you admit to the kidnapping, I can spare your son,” Yan Yongxiu pointed at Shen Tian and said.

Hearing this, Shen Yun hurriedly shook his head and said, “Mr. Yan, I really don’t understand what you’re saying...”

After saying that, Shen Yun even hurriedly gave Shen Tian a look.

Unfortunately, not only did Shen Tian ignore Shen Yun, but he even ran to Yan Yongxiu and said anxiously, “Yes, this matter was done by my father! It has nothing to do with me!”

Hearing Shen Tian’s words, Shen Yun was stunned on the spot.

“You... what nonsense are you spouting!” Shen Yun shouted angrily.

Shen Tian said in a panic, “Dad, admit it quickly. I’m still young. I don’t want to go to jail...”

“Mr. Yan said that as long as you admit it, he’ll let me go. Admit it quickly! You’re already so old. Even if you die, there’s no pity. I’m still young...”

Shen Yun could barely believe that these words came from his own son’s mouth!

At this moment, Shen Yun suddenly felt extremely regretful. He regretted indulging Shen Tian too much...

“What goes around comes around,” Yan Yongxiu said nonchalantly.

Shen Yun’s face was already covered in tears. He raised his head to look at Yan Yongxiu and said in anguish, “Mr. Yan, this matter... was done by me. It has nothing to do with my son. Please... please let him go...”

“Mr. Yan, you heard it. My father has already admitted it. Can I leave now?” Shen Yun said anxiously.

Yan Yongxiu looked at Shen Tian coldly and shook his head. “Kidnapping my daughter is an unforgivable crime.”

After saying this, Yan Yongxiu slowly stood up and turned around to leave.

Shen Tian immediately panicked. He shouted desperately, “Mr. Yan, you said you would let me go. You can’t go back on your word!”

Unfortunately, Yan Yongxiu completely ignored him and walked straight out of the door.

“You lied to me! Yan Yongxiu, you lied to me!” Shen Tian was on the verge of breaking down as he roared.

“I’ll fight it out with you. I’ll fight it out with you!” Shen Tian roared and then rushed towards Yan Yongxiu!

“Bang! Bang!”

At this moment, two gunshots suddenly came from outside the window!

The bullets shattered the glass and shot straight towards the Shen family’s father and son!

A bloody hole instantly appeared on their foreheads.

Following that, they collapsed to the ground dead.

“Reporting to the commander, the two criminals have been successfully killed!” A loud shout came from outside.

“Alright, return to the team.”

Qin Yu sat in the car and saw this scene clearly.

As he watched the scene in front of him, he couldn’t help but feel a sense of powerlessness.

Was this the power of the top aristocratic families in Jingdu...

Yan Ruoxue sat in the car silently. She seemed to have foreseen this outcome long ago.

Qin Yu looked at Yan Yongxiu, who walked out of the Shen family, and the sense of powerlessness in his heart grew.

It was because... The two bodyguards by Yan Yongxiu’s side were all top martial artists!

Qin Yu couldn’t even gauge their strength!
