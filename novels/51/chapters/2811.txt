Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Under such circumstances, even a huge unreasonable change would touch the commandment of the Investiture of Gods, let alone improvement. Then one would be directly erased.

“I’ve seen the three people ranked in the top ten of the Investiture of Gods. Their strength was comparable to that of ghosts and gods. I couldn’t even resist the internal qi they emitted. However, after they violated the commandments, they triggered the true power of the Investiture of Gods. In the blink of an eye, they were completely turned into ashes.” After a long silence, Smoker Xie told a cruel truth.

“My split soul also triggered some kind of power outside just now.”

Qin Yu said with a frown.

“That’s just the power of the Investiture of Gods’ patrol, not the real giant. If it comes down personally, you won’t appear here. The most important thing is your current strength is not enough to make him move.”

Smoker Xie said firmly.

He was not the person who had lived the longest here, but he was the one who could restrain himself and increase his strength the slowest.

Almost everyone who came here would use the power here to crazily increase their strength.

Little did they know that this increase would also increase the giant’s strength continuously.

Once it exceeded a certain threshold, they would be under the strong surveillance of the Investiture of Gods. They would end up in a life-and-death situation at that time.

“Are there no exceptions?”

Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

Smoker Xie shook his head.

“I have a guess. The purpose of this Investiture of Gods is to pry into everyone’s secrets. That’s why it keeps on deifying. Its purpose is also to continuously absorb the thoughts of the top geniuses and continuously improve the holder. According to our current speculations, the person who fused with the hundreds of artifact spirits should have become the holder.”

Qin Yu nodded. This was no different from what Smoker Xie had said before. He could understand.

“There are only two ideas now. One of them is to not increase our strength and try not to touch the commandments and attract the attention of the Investiture of Gods. As far as I know, it is very difficult for us to attract the attention with our current strength unless there is a huge strange phenomenon. The second is to secretly collect the Investiture of Gods and give it a heavy blow at the critical moment. ”

Smoker Xie analyzed.

“Even the consciousness can’t detect the incomplete page of the Investiture of Gods in your hand, so it’s an essential item. I guess the ‘key’ that the giant used to escape from this place was related to the Investiture of Gods’ true body. It might be the key to escape from this place, but this is my guess. You have to figure out everything yourself.” Smoker Xie said with a frown.

“Thank you very much.”

Qin Yu carefully analyzed the information Smoker Xie had given her for a long

time before he cupped his fists at him.

“If there is a chance, I will take one percent of your divine soul and leave this place.”

Hearing this, Smoker Xie’s body trembled violently. His eyes revealed an unconcealable joy.

There was no time, space, or gravity here.

There was only that crazy divine soul that was like a super brain and the illusory world of light and shadow.

Everyone knew that they were in this space, but they could not break through in their entire lives.

He wished to take another deep breath of the outside world and feel the touch of raindrops falling on his skin.

“The story you told me once helped me a lot. I will try my best to bring you away from here if I have the chance. However, once I find out that you have betrayed me to some extent, you will never have the chance to leave this place.” Qin Yu said lightly.

“Don’t worry. The time I have here is the longest despair. Even a little bit of hope is an extravagant hope for me, let alone you who has the Investiture of Gods. Perhaps this is my last hope in this life.”

Smoker Xie said with a bitter smile.

Since Qin Yu was afraid of the surveillance power of the Investiture of Investiture of Gods, he still stayed in the small house in the forest. This time, he stayed in the Investiture of Gods for nearly two days before leaving.

At this moment, a figure in a white robe sat quietly on the ground in the space of the Investiture of Gods.

The energy in his body changed rapidly, but it was maintained at the lowest level to avoid causing any reaction from the commandment.

“What an amazing magical artifact! Is this the core power of this magical artifact? It can cause some changes in my divine soul. It’s similar to the place of enlightenment in Buddhism. It can help my divine soul to comprehend to a certain extent, but this power is incomparable. My thoughts are non-stop.

Even the deduction of the power of Heavenly Sin has made great progress.”

Xiao Hails palm moved forward. The first level of the power of the curse mark appeared in the void of the Investiture of Gods.

“Oh no!”

Xiao Hai’s expression changed. His entire body instantly turned into a large cloud of blood mist.

Xiao Hai frowned slightly as if he was being monitored.

Heavenly Sin’s power once again came out of his palm. This time, the power was much stronger than before.

The power descended again, turning Xiao Hai into a bloody mist.

Hiss!

“It hurts!”

This time, Xiao Hai spent nearly ten days before his body slowly recovered.

If Smoker Xie was here, his jaw would probably drop in surprise.

This recovery speed was even faster than Qin Yu’s.

Back then, Xiao Hai had forcefully crossed the Dead Sea with his physical strength. This kind of endurance of the divine soul was practically unprecedented.

Qin Yu had comprehended the power of the dream and raised his divine soul to its current strength. Otherwise, he would not have been able to compete with Xiao Hai.

Different levels of power would result in different backlash.

“The power just now was already very dangerous. Although I won’t die here, the impact of this power makes me unable to think for a long time, so I have to try my best to avoid touching this monitoring power.”

“It seems that the lower the energy, the less attention it will attract.”

“In that case, I’ll start from the bottom. Coincidentally, I still have a lot of bottom-level power that I haven’t completely understood yet.

At this moment, in the dark Saint Kingdom, the originally ghostly aura was now shining brightly. The blazing sunlight slowly melted the ghostly aura.

Everyone stared at the blazing sun in the sky in horror. All the living beings in the Ksitigarbha Kingdom had never seen the Sun before.

It was because the blazing sun was the bane of ghost cultivators like them. The power of the Holy Lord Ksitigarbha had long since excluded the Sun from the Saint Kingdom.

However, the Sun shone into the Saint Kingdom once again. Was this an enemy invasion? Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

But how was that possible? This was the strongest Holy Lord in the ghost realm!

Even the masked woman was nurtured by him. What kind of existence dared to come here and provoke Ksitigarbha?

Ksitigarbha’s face was filled with rage and killing intent. The scorching sun was the most direct provocation to him.

He suddenly struck out with his palm!

That palm was like a huge door.

The entire world was filled with ghostly qi when the door was opened. A huge door appeared in the void..
