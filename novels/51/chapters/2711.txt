Chapter 2712: The Ring

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

An almost tangible blood aura burst out from the black shadow’s body. The boundless blood aura wanted to drag him out of the Endless Mine.

At this moment, the Buddha’s figure also appeared. It was a twisted face covered in blood.

This face was like a demon that had crawled out of hell, making one’s heart tremble.

At this moment, he let out a furious roar.

The entire space became hazy. This was a Dream Qi that was similar to the Night Qi.

It was just that this power was much stronger than Qin Yu’s current Night Qi.

It pulled him into the dream. He instantly disappeared from where he was.

“Since you’re already here, it wouldn’t be right if you don’t leave something for me.”

The Dagger said lazily. It suddenly appeared in Qin Yu’s hand.

Qin Yu instantly lost control of his body. He waved his hand at the blood qi.

A saber energy flashed from the dagger and directly cut through the space.

A miserable howl erupted from the blood qi and an arm fell.

“I’ve remembered your internal qi.”

A calm voice that made people afraid came from Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

Qin Yu’s scalp went numb. It was not good news for him to be remembered by such a great god.

The dagger in Qin Yu’s hand erupted with a huge force again, swallowing the arm on the ground.

“I’ll give this to you. The energy I got this time is not bad. I’m going to sleep.”

“Wait… ”

Before Qin Yu could say anything, a ring was thrown out from space casually and landed on the ground.

Even though Qin Yu was used to the actions of the dagger, he still felt the urge to curse at this moment.

Qin Yu picked up the ring on the ground. It was a very ancient-looking ring.

It was covered with traces of bronze rust and there was a mark on it. It looked like it had been attacked.

Furthermore, there were a few shallow marks on it. It seemed to be the outline of a human head with a dragon body.

For some reason, Qin Yu had a strong sense of unease when he looked at the creature.

Before he could react, he felt a sense of dread.

The creature in front of Qin Yu suddenly expanded in his pupils. His body was locked by an internal qi, completely unable to move.

That feeling was like the portrait of the ring, expanding in front of Qin Yu’s eyes.

However, Qin Yu couldn’t see its face although it was extremely close to him.

It wasn’t that he couldn’t see it, but that he forgot its appearance the next second he saw it!

Boom!

A dull sound exploded in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness. The creature in front of him suddenly split into two and pulled apart.

Then, the creature came alive and let out a sharp sound.

That voice seemed to have a summoning power, guiding Qin Yu forward.

Qin Yu’s body stepped into it uncontrollably. His divine soul transmitted an extreme desire.

There seemed to be something that he had been dreaming of. Qin Yu slowly walked through the door.

It was a long passage. Every step he took made a rustling sound.

The ground was covered in broken bones.

As Qin Yu stepped in, these skeletons shattered one after another.

This passageway was so quiet that Qin Yu could hear the sound of his breathing. At the end of the passageway, there seemed to be a huge space. “Where is that place? Where does it lead to?”

Qin Yu was slightly confused. He did not know where this ring would lead him to.

Suddenly, a gentle force stopped Qin Yu.

Countless crows stood in front of Qin Yu, blocking his way.

Qin Yu was shocked. He suddenly woke up.

He turned around and saw that he had walked a long distance.

However, he had no impression of it at all. His body seemed to be tied down by a string.

If the Night Qi in his body had not reminded him, he would have continued to advance and entered that unknown space.

Qin Yu hurriedly retreated from the passageway. The moment he was stunned, he saw a face staring at him.

This gave Qin Yu a big fright and he directly punched out.

“Ouch!”

The man let out a miserable howl and rolled on the ground.

“I’m sorry! Xi Ming!”

Qin Yu finally realized that the person was Xi Ming. His divine soul had been sucked into the Nineteenth Prison, and now he had returned.

“It’s ok. I’m fine. I’m just like you. I don’t know what happened. I seem to have lost my memory for some time.”

Xi Ming rubbed his dark eyes and said with a bitter smile.

“And why did your body and internal qi suddenly disappear?”

Xi Ming asked curiously. ‘What? Did my body just disappear?”

Qin Yu was shocked.

He rubbed the ring in his hand. At this moment, he no longer dared to explore the mysteries of this ring.

Only now did he realize that in such a short moment, the Saint Power in his body was almost completely drained.

His mind was also extremely exhausted. If he continued to stay in the passage, his body would probably be sucked dry.

At this moment, there were only a few traces of the Night qi, almost invisible.

If he wanted to use the power of dream again, this bit of Night Qi was simply not enough.

“That’s right! I was just searching around here when you suddenly appeared.

I’m sorry for being rude.”

Xi Ming said with a bitter smile.

At this moment, there was a commotion in the surroundings. Cultivators wearing different robes appeared nearby.

Judging from the style of the robe, it wasn’t just the Path of Heaven Academy.

The Upper Dome and the Guardian of Order were also here. With the destruction of the Nineteenth Prison, the spatial seal had been unlocked.

These cultivators could enter the Endless Mine through the teleportation formation.

“Brother Xi Ming, you’re here before us. Did you find anything when you entered this place?”

A group of Guardians of Order appeared near Qin Yu and the others.

Xi Ming smiled bitterly and shook his head.

“It seems like there’s a top-notch martial artist behind this. Most of the people in the mine turned into living corpses. This is the first time I’ve seen such a situation. I just wonder who saved us.”

Xi Ming’s expression was extremely ugly. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“According to what we know, nearly a hundred thousand people have already lost their lives. In addition, what happened here seems to be related to the Nineteenth Prison according to Lord Yi Yun. We need to search for the clues now and see if we can find out anything.”

The leader was a woman with delicate features. Her appearance was not outstanding.

However, she was wearing a tight suit that accentuated her perfect figure.

“Wu Qian?”

Qin Yu suddenly felt that the person was somewhat familiar..
