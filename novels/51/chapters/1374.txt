Chapter 1375: Chapter 1375, Heavenly Cloud Sect’s action 1

Qin Yu, who was caught off guard, was instantly crushed to the ground by this force.

He frowned slightly and was about to get up when he noticed that there were threads of golden threads on the ground.

These golden threads flickered with a weak radiance as if they had grown out of the ground and were deeply attached to the ground.

Following the golden thread, one could see dense golden threads ahead!

These golden threads actually covered the entire city!

“This... What is this thing?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but be dumbstruck.

The entire city was filled with these golden threads. It was extremely strange for them to climb on the ground.

Such a scene was something Qin Yu had never seen before!

“It’s a divine inscription.”

At this moment, a voice sounded in Qin Yu’s mind.

The sudden voice scared Qin Yu so much that he staggered.

“Who’s there!”Qin Yu got up from the ground vigilantly and scanned his surroundings coldly.

“I’m Your Grandpa!”The voice sounded again.

Qin Yu was stunned. He asked tentatively, “You... you’re tie Dan?”

“Yes, I am! Damn it!”Tie Dan couldn’t help but curse.

Qin Yu was overjoyed and asked hurriedly, “Damn it, I thought you were dead!”

“You’re the one who’s dead,”tie Dan retorted.

Qin Yu wasn’t in the mood to argue with him, so she quickly told tie Dan about the current situation.

“I’ve offended the number one sect in the South Province, the Heavenly Cloud sect. Think of something quickly,”Qin Yu urged.

Tie Dan couldn’t help but curse, “Damn it, why do I always encounter this kind of trouble every time I wake up? !”

“Do you have a way or not? I reckon the people of the Heavenly Cloud sect will catch up soon,”said Qin Yu with a frown.

“Also, I need a large amount of life qi, or else my spiritual power will not be able to recover.”

Tie Dan was silent for a moment, then said in a deep voice, “Borrow the divine patterns and activate the formation. If you don’t meet a top-tier cultivator, you won’t have a problem protecting yourself.”

“Divine patterns? is that the pattern under your feet?”Qin Yu asked.

Tie Dan nodded and said, “Leave the initiative of your body to me. I’ll activate the formation.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Are you sure it’s useful? The Heavenly Cloud sect is full of powerful cultivators, and there are countless experts. How can you protect yourself with just this divine pattern?”

Tie Dan snorted coldly and said, “Do you know the origin of the divine patterns? Those are the dao patterns captured by great cultivators in the Tribulation Stage. They are not something that a mere powerful cultivator can compare with.”

“Your Luck isn’t bad. Although this divine inscription isn’t complete, it can still protect a city. The only pity is that if I resurrect this divine inscription, I’ll probably fall into a deep sleep again.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu immediately rejected tie Dan’s suggestion.

“Even if I resurrect this divine inscription, I’ll still be trapped here. Then I won’t be able to recover my spiritual power for the rest of my life, so it’s meaningless.”Qin Yu shook her head.

Tie Dan asked in astonishment, “Do you know how precious a city filled with divine inscriptions is?”

“I don’t need it. No matter how precious it is, it would be meaningless,”qin yu said with a bitter smile.

“Forget it. Let’s leave this place quickly. I want to go to Yang City to look for the aura of life.”

With that, Qin Yu turned around and left the divine capital, continuing on her way to Yang City.

After Iron Egg recovered, Qin Yu could be considered to have a companion.

“I’ve been in the holy region for so long, but I haven’t been able to raise my strength at all. How Tragic.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

There were endless treasures in the holy region, and all sorts of resources were countless. However, before Qin Yu recovered his spiritual energy, he was unable to do anything. This made him extremely unwilling.

Another two days passed.

Qin Yu was less than three hundred stars away from Yang City.

‘at this speed, I should be able to reach Yang City in two days at most,’Qin Yu thought to himself.

The journey was rather smooth. Qin Yu tried his best to avoid crowded places, which caused his journey to be much slower.

Just as Qin Yu was about to reach Yang City, he accidentally heard a piece of news.

On this day, he was having a meal at a restaurant in a city. He planned to fill his stomach before stepping into the mountain range of Yang City.

But at this moment, the voice beside him entered Qin Yu’s ears.

“It seems that the Heavenly Cloud sect and Qin Yu have become much quieter recently,”someone said.

“Haven’t you heard? The sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect is already furious. He would rather sacrifice everything to find Qin Yu.”

“Mm, it’s said that the Heavenly Cloud sect has given up on pursuing Qin Yu because it’s too inefficient. I heard that one of Qin Yu’s friends is still in the Heavenly Cloud sect. They said that they want Qin Yu to go to the Heavenly Cloud sect to admit his punishment. Otherwise, they will kill all of his friends.”

“Kill all of them? What do you mean? Could it be that Qin Yu still has many friends in the Heavenly Cloud Sect?”

“No, it’s said that Qin Yu and the others came from an ancient star. These few days, the Heavenly Cloud sect is preparing to activate the ancient array platform and set foot on this ancient star again. If they still can’t find Qin Yu, they will start a massacre on that ancient star.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically!

He slammed the table and stood up, staring at the people in front of him.

“Who... Who Did you all hear it from?”Qin Yu rushed forward and asked. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

These people were shocked by Qin Yu’s actions. They stared at him and said, “Why are you so agitated? You scared me.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath. He didn’t say anything. He threw down the money and turned around to leave.
