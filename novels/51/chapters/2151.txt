2152 Several People Joining Forces

Dean Lei’s body seemed to have turned into a bolt of lightning as he charged toward the True Saints.

The boundless power of the lightning accompanied his charge. The three thunderlights of golden lotus spun wildly around him like three crazy whirlwinds!

The three thunderlights of golden lotus arrived before the True Saints almost instantly. Immediately after, they exploded like three miniature suns. The boundless power of lightning instantly devoured everything.

The sky was completely shattered as if a mirror had been forcibly shattered. Countless fragments flew in all directions, falling like raindrops!

The original brilliant stars had already lost their light at this moment. They were like dull stones that fell powerlessly.

The ground could not remain stable in the face of this power. The ground seemed to be chewed by a giant beast, and cracks spread everywhere.

The power shattered those lofty mountains and sturdy stone walls and blew away like autumn leaves.

The ancient trees were like fragile straws in the face of this power. Their barks peeled off, and their branches and leaves scattered as if they were screaming.

The creatures on the ground were like ants in the face of this power. They collapsed one after another, and their lives were extinguished like candlelight.

All the dao techniques seemed to have lost their color at this moment. The power of lightning seemed to be destroying everything!

The mysterious magical runes and the dazzling formations shattered in the face of this power. The dao technique collapsed, and everything seemed to reduce to ashes!

In the void, the cracks moved like dragons. The dark abyss seemed to be devouring all light.

The crack was like a black spider web, spreading everywhere as if it wanted to tear the entire world apart!

Everything became chaotic and ruined under Dean Lei’s attack. Everything seemed to freeze at this moment.

The moment the thunderlights of the golden lotus exploded, the True Saints let out a heroic roar. They waved the magical artifacts in their hands and unleashed their most powerful techniques. Their figures shone in the thunderlights like brilliant stars in the night sky.

Si Liuhe had used some techniques to envelop everyone in his light, and he was resisting the three thunderlights of the golden lotus from Dean Lei!

However, Dean Lei was too strong. Even Si Liuhe’s face turned somewhat pale.

His hands were constantly emitting a terrifying internal qi as if he was maintaining this barrier. It seemed to be quite strenuous.

The other True Saints naturally would not be idle. They hurriedly released their internal qi, wanting to do something together. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

However, this was Si Liuhe’s secret technique, and other people could not integrate their techniques into it. Everything was futile.

Si Liuhe gritted his teeth. Sweat beaded on his forehead, and his body was trembling as if he could not hold on any longer!

Si Liuhe’s face was ashen, almost drained of blood. His hands were shaking, and he was rapidly running out of energy. He used all his strength and faith to maintain this barrier, hoping to withstand Dean Lei’s crazy attack.

However, the power of the thunderlights of the golden lotus was too powerful. Dean Lei’s attack was like an endless river of lightning, madly attacking the barrier. Under the impact of the lightning, cracks began to appear on the barrier and it looked like going to collapse at any moment.

“Crack!”

A crisp sound rang out, and the next moment, densely packed cracks appeared on the entire barrier!

Before everyone could exclaim, the barrier completely shattered!

Immediately after, three thunderlights swarmed in and exploded almost instantly!

In an instant, the radiance of the thunderlights was like three wolf-like suns, exploding in the void violently and domineeringly!

Thunderlights that looked like dragons gushed out of the hole, tearing the void apart. The pieces flew everywhere like countless meteors in the night sky.

The radiance of the thunderlights illuminated the entire world as if it was daytime. However, this bright light brought destruction and death. Everything seemed so small in the face of the endless power of lightning, like the light of a firefly under the scorching sun.

The originally quiet ground began to tremble violently in front of this power as if it was afraid of this boundless power.

The earth was torn apart, and huge cracks spread like a spider web. It was as if the entire world was collapsing!

Scorching heat and destructive internal q filled the air. The power of the thunderlights swept across the entire sky, burning the clouds into ashes.

In the sky, the twinkling stars had completely disappeared, leaving only the light of thunderlights.

The three True Saints in the center of the thunderlights were instantly killed by this powerful attack.

Their bodies were instantly turned to ashes by the impact of the power of the thunderlights, and their souls were devoured by the radiance of the thunderlights as they wailed.

The entire world fell silent at this moment. Only the roar of thunderlights echoed. Dean Lei’s attack was like the roar of an ancient divine beast, shaking the entire world.

The radiance slowly faded, and the three True Saints died. The remaining seven were covered in different wounds.

Si Liuhe had secret techniques. He escaped the explosion quickly, and the wounds on his body were much lighter. However, Dean Lei’s attack had tremendously infuriated Si Liuhe!

He glared at Dean Lei and said through gritted teeth, “You d*mned old thing! You actually killed three of our True Saints!”

Dean Lei’s internal qi became a little unstable, but he still forced himself to say, “I’ll kill you next!”

“Hahaha, Dean Lei, don’t force yourself. I’m afraid the current you no longer have that ability,” Si Liuhe said coldly.

Apart from the seven True Saints, Yan Tianshi, who was not far away, was unharmed. He had not even made a move.

“Dean Lei, you should quickly leave…” Qin Yu’s heart was in immense pain. He could not bear to see Dean Lei die in battle because of him!

“I’m afraid it’s too late to leave now,” Si Liuhe said coldly.

“Do you think I’m afraid of you?” Dean Lei sneered and said.

Although he said that, Dean Lei secretly regretted it.

“If I had known the situation today would be so dangerous, I would have brought my ancestor’s Celestial Artifact!” Dean Lei cursed in his heart.

However, at this point, it was useless to say anything. His internal qi was already unstable. Facing these eight True Saints, it was almost a situation where he would die!

At this moment, Si Liuhe’s body was surging with terrifying killing intent as he walked toward Dean Lei step by step.

Behind him were the seven True Saints.

These people all had angry expressions as if they wanted to kill Dean Lei immediately!

“Today is the day you die!” Si Liuhe’s voice was so cold that it could shake heaven and earth as if he was issuing a death notice.
