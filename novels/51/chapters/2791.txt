Chapter 2792: The Terrifying Family

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Lance, have you forgotten about the thing I have on me? My family will think that we’ve wasted our reputation as the number one treasure family if we don’t fight for it with the heaven-defying item.”

A crazed look flashed across Fatty Situ’s face.

“That talisman mustn’t be used. It’s the last life-saving measure! It’s also Sir Situ Mot s order to protect you!”

Lance, the leader of the men in black, suddenly turned stern.

One of his hands landed in Fatty Situ’s hand.

“Take him away!”

The other two immediately controlled Fatty’s body.

Lance’s expression turned cold. He was also very interested in the Investiture of Gods.

However, just as he said, they might still be able to put all-out effort if Fatty Situ wasn’t here.

Since the only young lord of the Situ family was here, their bet was already sealed.

The three of them had also held back when they used the Divine Sun Vine.

Boom!

A terrifying force exploded from Fatty Situ’s body, instantly sending the three of them flying.

A wisp of talisman fire slowly ignited and the smoke that carried the smell of incense spread out.

The smoke slowly rose and formed countless fine outlines.

As the smoke dissipated, a world of smoke seemed to have formed around Fatty.

It was as if thousands of smokers were smoking in an enclosed space at the same time.

However, one would find countless mountains and rivers, and hundreds of millions of living shuttling inside when one probed with the divine sense. Whereas the target of their worship was Fatty Situ surrounded by smoke.

As he moved, the entire ancient divine kingdom was shaken.

“Now that I’ve used it, you can see whether you want to fight with me or fight to the death with me. Let’s wait until the power of this talisman is completely exhausted.”

Fatty Situ chuckled.

The black-robed man, Lance, had an extremely ugly expression.

Fatty’s power was almost invincible after receiving the worship of all the Holy Consciousness in this divine kingdom. Even if the three of them went all out, they probably couldn’t suppress him.

“Uncle Lance, don’t worry. I’m not crazy. It’s just that I think if I run away because I’m afraid of death at this time, I won’t be worthy of being the Situ family’s Leader in the future. I’m afraid I’ll regret my choice today for the rest of my life. And if things don’t work out, I’ll use the talisman’s power to leave immediately.”

Fatty Situ said softly when he saw Lance’s bitter face.

“Sigh! You seriously look like your father.”

Lance shook his head.

“Da*n, Little Fatty! You looked like you were possessed by Creepy just now.

You’re different from the beginning.”

Chang Mang curiously grabbed Fatty Situ’s four-layered chin, then let go of it and let it bounce back.

“Get lost! ”

This was the first time Fatty Situ had seen someone more frivolous than him. He couldn’t control his anger and sent him flying with a punch.

“Oh no!”

He didn’t control his strength properly and Chang Mang was sent out of the Heavenly Umbrella’s protective range.

However, Chang Mang did not seem to be in any injury after he landed.

That terrifying pressure only made him spit out a mouthful of blood.

However, his injuries did not seem to be serious. Soon, he ran back energetically.

“This is the power of the holy body, Divine Might Chasing Star! He shouldn’t be in danger as long as he is in the Saint Kingdom unless the kingdom is destroyed.”

Lance’s face lit up.

However, he suddenly understood when he saw the purple lightning on Chang Mang’s body.

“Uncle, is this power the same as the holy daughter’s? If the Saint Kingdom’s fate weakens, will it also affect the person?”

Qin Yu frowned as he asked. The first time he heard about this holy body was from Immortal Emperor Yao.

From Lance’s words, it seemed he knew some secrets about this holy body.

This world chooses host of the Divine Might Chasing Star. It will only choose a new master after the previous host dies. However, unlike the fate of a holy daughter, the power of the Divine Might Chasing Star is more based on the power of this region. Even if the Saint Power is completely exhausted, he will not be affected much.”

Qin Yu still wanted to ask something, but the battle escalated again.

After the Divine Sun Vine was knocked away, the incomplete piece of paper was about to disappear into the void.

Countless terrifying attacks immediately hit it. The terrifying energy directly distorted the space around the Investiture of Gods.

The space was completely sealed, and the Investiture of Gods was frozen.

Almost all those people who attacked were at the top of the Nine Nether Cliff.

These people had been practicing martial arts at the Nine Nether Cliff all year round, so their strength had already reached its peak.

In an instant, the internal qi of the peak power completely erupted.

Countless forces pierced through it.

Even in the space suppressed by the Investiture of Gods in the void, the place still emitted a terrifying tremor. “Since you have appeared today, then just stay.”

Ming Alester said lightly.

The old man behind him flashed past.

In the next moment, a sword light appeared in front of everyone.

This sword light seemed to have appeared in their past and then disappeared.

Instant Sword!

This sword strike was both instantaneous and eternal.

The moment the sword light streaked across, it lit up an even deeper void passage. The air seemed to be frozen.

When the sword light disappeared, the sword in the old servant’s hand had already pierced through the space around the Investiture of Gods.

His sword slowly stabbed in and ripples appeared around the Investiture of Gods.

Only at this moment did everyone regain their senses.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

From the moment the sword was unleashed to the moment everyone regained their senses, two breaths had passed!

“What a terrifying sword! It can affect our thoughts.”

Aiden murmured.

“It’s not affecting our thoughts. It’s that this sword light has affected time. At the time that this sword light was released, all of us were frozen. Only this sword can move.”

Lance was also shocked.

Previously, they had also obtained this Heart Sutra Sword Technique and had chosen top-notch swordsmen from the Situ family to cultivate this sword technique.

During the trip to Heavenly Sin, a swordsman also protected Fatty Situ. However, he eventually died in Heavenly Sin.

It could be said that this sword technique was not a top-notch secret. However, the people of the Alester family had cultivated to such a level.

“What a terrifying clan!”

Lance gasped.

This was almost at its limit. The Instant Sword could affect time.

The old slave’s long white eyebrows and hair stood up straight.

He gripped the sword with both hands and seemed to be stabbing out with all his might.

Ding!

In the next moment, the tide-like pressure exploded.

It crushed    sword in the long-browed old servant’s hand..
