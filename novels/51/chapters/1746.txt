Chapter 1747: Consequences of Taking the Reversion Void Pill

Qin Yu was well aware of his current state.

Jing Bai had said that the side effects of the Reversion Void Pill were extremely great, but even Qin Yu didn’t know what kind of side effects it would produce.

If Yuan Xiu was to return, no one would be able to protect him except for Divine Capital City.

After arriving at Divine Capital City, Qin Yu was relieved.

!!

“I don’t know where that bastard Iron Egg went.” Qin Yu could not help but frown.

This bastard was extremely powerful to begin with, and he had most likely already reached the Reversion Void Stage after the Great Upheaval.

Whether it was in terms of physique or age, Iron Egg was no worse than Yuan Xiu.

Furthermore, from what he had said, Iron Egg’s talent should be very strong, at least not weaker than Yuan Xiu’s.

It was a pity that he had not appeared since the last time.

“I didn’t expect you to be the one who defeated Yuan Xiu.” Qu Zhu couldn’t help but sigh.

“I’m afraid I’ll be in a coma for a while,” Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

“Reversion Void Pill… I’ve heard that it’s a kind of pill with great side effects. This kind of pill that can improve one’s strength in a short time has great side effects.” Wen Wanchong said.

Then, Wen Wanchong changed the topic and said with a smile, “However, your ability to reach the Reversion Void Stage has really surprised us. This pill has brought you to the Reversion Void Stage. If you really do reach the Reversion Void Stage, I’m afraid you will be even more powerful.”

Qin Yu had the same feeling.

The effects of the Reversion Void Pill were much greater than Qin Yu had imagined.

In that case, if he were to reach the half-step Reversion Void Stage, he might be able to face a Reversion Void Stage expert like Xiao Sheng.

“In the following period of time, try not to leave the Divine Capital City…” Qin Yu said.

“There’s a Divine Inscription Formation here. It shouldn’t be easy for Yuan Xiu to barge in.”

“I’m afraid it’s not as optimistic as you think.” At this moment, Peng Liu suddenly walked over.

Qu Zhu and Wen Wanchong looked at Peng Liu suspiciously and said in surprise, “This is?”

“I am Peng Liu, a nobody. I am far from the level of the two seniors.” Peng Liu cupped his hands and said.

Qin Yu gave a simple introduction, then looked at Peng Liu, signaling him to continue.

“Before you guys arrived, Yuan Xiu almost destroyed the Divine Inscription Formation,” Peng Liu continued.

“What?” Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically.

Was this Yuan Xiu actually so terrifying? Could he even break through a Divine Inscription Formation?

“He’s not an ordinary Reversion Void Stage cultivator, you can’t use common sense to judge him.” Wen Wanchong said in a deep voice.

“That’s right,” Qu Zhu nodded. “An ordinary Reversion Void Stage cultivator would not be a match for the two of us.”

Qin Yu fell silent. He had already sensed Yuan Xiu’s strength when he was fighting him just now.

He knew very well that Yuan Xiu had many trump cards that he had yet to use. If they were to fight with their lives on the line, Qin Yu, who had advanced to this realm with the help of the Reversion Void Pill, might not be able to defeat him.

Moreover, Wen Wanchong and Qu Zhu had already exhausted him.

Qin Yu did not have a complete understanding of Yuan Xiu’s strength. Although he seemed to have won the battle just now, he had a feeling that this was not the true strength of Yuan Xiu.

It was known that Qu Zhu and Wen Wanchong were not inferior to anyone else. Except for the Xiao brothers, few people in the entire Nanzhou could be compared to them.

But even so, they were still fighting with great difficulty.

“If Yuan Xiu comes again, I’m afraid we’ll have to fight.” Wen Wanchong said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. Of course, he didn’t want anything to happen to the two of them, but it seemed like there was no other way.

“We’ll think about it after the Divine Capital City is breached.” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

He had wanted to try to repair the formation, but Qin Yu’s current state could no longer bear it. Even if he wanted to repair the formation, he had no strength.

So, Qin Yu took out the bracelet and the iron rod that Xiao Yu had given him and handed them to the two. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“I don’t know the origin of these two things, but I know they are definitely extraordinary. If they can help you, that would be the best.” Qin Yu said.

As he spoke, Qin Yu’s vision started to turn black.

He waved his hand and wanted to say something, but he passed out without realizing it.

Looking at the fallen Qin Yu, Wen Wanchong and Qu Zhu were not too surprised.

“I wonder if the Reversion Void Pill will leave any hidden injuries.” Qu Zhu said.

Wen Wanchong sneered, “He’s not afraid of being bitten by lice, I guess he doesn’t care anymore ..”

Qu Zhu spread out his hands and didn’t say anything more.

As for how to deal with Yuan Xiu, he could only take it one step at a time.

…

In the North Plain.

After this battle, Yuan Xiu’s expression was extremely ugly and terrifying!

“I didn’t expect this Qin Yu to have such a terrifying ability.” Yuan Xiu said coldly.

His eyes suddenly turned to He Teng.

He Teng’s body trembled slightly and he immediately knelt.

“Why did you speak up to save Qin Yu?” Yuan Xiu said coldly.

He Teng’s expression changed slightly and he said hurriedly, “I didn’t… No, master, I didn’t mean it that way. I have a deep hatred for Qin Yu. How could I save him!”

“Do you think I’m an idiot?” Yuan Xiu squinted his eyes and his voice became colder.

“What, are you still thinking about your hometown?” Sima Bei said with a smile that was not a smile.

“No!” He Teng hurriedly shook his head and said, “I don’t mean it that way. please look into it!”

Yuan Xiu snorted coldly and a faint light appeared on his finger.

This light was only the size of a grain of rice, but the power it contained was extremely terrifying. Even Yong Ji and Sima Bei could not help but change their expressions!

“If you don’t tell me the truth, I’ll kill you right now.” Yuan Xiu said coldly.

He Teng knelt on the ground and said, ” I’m telling the truth. Even if the Lord kills me, I’m telling the truth…”

Yuan Xiu said no more. The light on his finger landed between He Teng’s eyebrows.

He Teng’s expression was extremely unsightly. His forehead was dripping with sweat, but he still had no intention of changing his words.

The beam of light was getting closer and closer to He Teng, from ten centimeters to one centimeter.

The scorching power burned He Teng’s skin. Everyone’s hearts were at their throats.

Even Yong Ji and Sima Bei swallowed their saliva, their faces filled with anxiety.

Once this ray of light fell, He Teng’s soul would probably be completely annihilated!

However, just as the ray of light was about to touch He Teng, Yuan Xiu retracted his finger.

He clasped his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Alright, since that’s the case, I’ll believe you for now. I want you to tell me everything you know about Qin Yu, including why he’s so powerful.”
