1874 The Heaven’s Favorites of the Holy Region

Jue Wu’s body slowly recovered, and Qin Yu’s worried heart finally settled down.

After dealing with the Tong family, he should consider going to Zhongzhou.

Of course, Qin Yu knew that it was not the time to leave yet.

He had promised the peak master and owed many people points. He would consider leaving Demon-slaying Peak after he had paid them back.

!!

The next day, Qin Yu went to the first main peak to return the Saint Weapon.

When Qin Yu returned to the Demon-slaying Peak, the peak master happened to walk in.

He stood in front of Qin Yu and said with a smile,”Qin Yu, do you still remember what you promised me?”

“Of course.” Qin Yu quickly stood up.

“There are still three days left,” the peak master said with a smile. “You should prepare yourself.”

“So fast?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but be surprised.

The peak master nodded. “That’s right. Don’t let your guard down. The entire Thunder Courtyard’s eight main peaks will be participating.”

“Eight main peaks?” Qin Yu was even more confused.

“Does the first main peak count?”

The peak master nodded. “Of course. The first main peak is filled with the last disciples of the various elders and lecturers. Their strength is also the strongest among them.”

Qin Yu frowned.

He didn’t expect that someone from the first main peak would participate.

As the last disciples, their strength was naturally the strongest among the eight main peaks.

However, Qin Yu was not worried. As long as he did not enter the True Saint realm, he was not afraid of anyone, even the inner disciples.

“What, are you starting to worry?” The peak master teased.

“Of course not.” Qin Yu shook his head. “So, there will be a total of eight people participating?”

“That’s right.” The peak master nodded slightly.

“Okay, I got it. If it’s convenient, it’s best to give me the list of these people.” Qin Yu said.

However, the peak master shook his head and said, “That’s impossible. The competition of the eight main peaks is to test the abilities of the disciples. If the list is announced in advance, everyone will have made preparations in advance. It will be meaningless.”

Qin Yu thought for a while and agreed.

For example, if they knew that Qin Yu was the participant from Demon-slaying Peak, they would definitely have developed a primordial spirit technique in advance to target him, so that he would not be able to see their true strength.

“Alright, I understand.” Qin Yu said with a nod.

The peak master grunted and consoled, “You don’t have to be too stressed. I’m not hoping for first place. I’ll be content if we can get into the top three.”

“No.” Qin Yu shook his head. “Since I’ve promised you, I’ll definitely get the first place.”

Seeing this, the peak master did not say anything more and just nodded.

After the peak master left, Qin Yu sat down cross-legged.

He wasn’t worried at all. Instead, he was looking forward to it.

Because those who could come to Demon-slaying Peak must be geniuses from all over the world.

Those who were able to participate in this competition were naturally the heaven’s favorites among heaven’s favorites.

This was also the first time Qin Yu would truly faced the geniuses of the Holy Region. Their strength was not inferior to those princes of Zhongzhou!

“I can finally compete with you guys.” Qin Yu thought to himself.

In the following time, Qin Yu didn’t make any special preparations for this, but accompanied Jue Wu to eat, drink, and have fun all day.

Chang Mang also quickly became one with Jue Wu. Although Chang Mang was powerful, he was still slightly inferior to Jue Wu.

After a few days of eating and drinking, Jue Wu’s strength had also improved.

On this day.

Jue Wu, who had been gnawing on the donkey leg, suddenly stood up. She looked at Qin Yu in a daze, looking extremely abnormal.

“What’s the matter?” Qin Yu frowned.

Jue Wu frowned and said, “I seem to have thought of how to use that strange power…”

“That strange power?” Qin Yu was stunned.

Jue Wu nodded and said, “It’s that Purple Power.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Purple… The Purple Cloud Pearl?” Qin Yu turned pale with fright!

The significance of the Purple Cloud Pearl was extraordinary. Back then, the Yan family had said that the Purple Cloud Pearl was even more terrifying than a Saint Weapon!

If Jue Wu was able to use the power of the Purple Cloud Pearl, then her strength would be unimaginable!

Jue Wu stopped eating and drinking. She went to a quiet place and sat down cross-legged.

A moment after she sat down, wisps of purple light surrounded her.

The light grew brighter and brighter until it finally illuminated the entire cave abode!

Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel speechless.

If Jue Wu could really completely devour the power of the Purple Cloud Pearl, then her strength would be incomparable to that of her realm.

By then, her strength would not be weaker than a Semi-Saint, or even a True Saint!

In the next few days, Qin Yu didn’t dare to disturb Jue Wu. He could only use the desolate divine eye to secretly watch Jue Wu, afraid that she would get into an accident.

...

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed, but Jue Wu still didn’t show any signs of coming out.

“It seems that it’s unlikely for Jue Wu to participate in this competition.” Qin Yu thought to himself.

At this moment, the peak master appeared in the cave abode.

As soon as he stepped into the cave abode, he noticed the strange purple light.

The light turned the clouds in the sky purple, which was a wonderful scene.

“What is it?” the peak master asked, frowning.

“Jue Wu is in seclusion,” Qin Yu explained without hiding anything.

The peak master made an “Oh” sound and didn’t ask any more questions. After all, Jue Wu was a bit different.

“We should set off.” The peak master said.

Qin Yu grunted in agreement. He turned to look at Chang Mang and said, “Chang Mang, you don’t need to come with me. Stay here and take good care of Jue Wu.”

Although Chang Mang was a little unwilling, he still agreed.

...

After that, Qin Yu followed the peak master and left the cave.

After walking out of the cave, he found that many members of Demon-slaying Peak had gathered here, as if waiting to set off, and Jiu Xiao was among them.

“Everyone can watch?” Qin Yu asked in surprise.

“Of course. Otherwise, it would be too quiet. This is the annual grand event of Thunder Courtyard. All the aristocratic families in Zhongzhou will participate.” The peak master said proudly.

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly, and he asked tentatively, “The nine great aristocratic families of Zhongzhou… Will they all participate?”

“Of course!” When this topic was brought up, the peak master was obviously even prouder.

“The Thunder Courtyard is on par with the nine great aristocratic families!” He said proudly. “Of course, there will be people participating in this grand event.”

Qin Yu had a bad feeling in his heart.

He had thought that it would be an internal competition of Thunder Courtyard, but he did not expect that he would be facing the entire Holy Region.

In that case, Qin Yu could no longer hide the fact that he had a chaotic body.

“If I had known this would happen, I wouldn’t have participated.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse.

“It’s a wonderful thing if you’re chosen by some aristocratic family,” the peak master said, puzzled. “You have no idea how many people would want to participate.

“Sigh, you don’t understand,” Qin Yu waved his hand and sighed.

Since things had come to this, Qin Yu had no other choice but to bite the bullet and go.

Anyway, he would have to face Si Shiyue sooner or later, so it didn’t matter.
