Chapter 908: Chapter 908, activate the battle word technique! 

Qin Yu felt the abundant internal Qi in his body. At this moment, he was extremely confident.

However, he knew clearly in his heart that the He Teng in front of him was definitely not simple. He was much more powerful than he had imagined!

Even Qin Yu felt his heart palpitate when he sensed the internal Qi that was close to that of a martial saint!

He Teng looked at Qin Yu coldly. No one knew what he was thinking.

“This body... is really wonderful...”that hoarse voice sounded from he teng’s body again.

“If it’s possible, take his body...”

He Teng snorted lightly.

Take his body? Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

If he really took Qin Yu’s body, wouldn’t he be abandoned?

When he thought of this, he Teng’s hatred towards Qin Yu increased by a few points!

They were both geniuses, but in front of Qin Yu, his glory was no longer worth mentioning!

“Qin Yu...”He Teng’s eyes narrowed slightly.

“I’ll let you become my fodder!”

Along with He Teng’s furious roar, his body quickly emerged from the black fog and turned into a physical form!

He Teng seemed to want to fight head-on with Qin Yu in terms of strength! He wanted to use his internal Qi that was close to a martial saint to defeat Qin Yu!

The two of them instantly trembled. The collision of their physical bodies and the clash of their cultivation techniques caused the scene to emit waves of terrifying explosive sounds!

The sound spread in all directions, and wherever it passed, everything turned into dust!

“Boom!”

With a clash of fists, the two of them retreated several steps at the same time!

Traces of shock appeared in the hearts of both parties!

“What a terrifying power!”Both of them whispered at the same time!

“Go to hell!”

He Teng was the first to attack. He relied on his internal Qi that was close to the martial saint stage and rushed towards Qin Yu like a raging storm!

Qin Yu did not dare to be negligent. He raised his hand and unleashed the absolute beginning holy fist. At this moment, the power of the Divine Dragon also erupted!

As Qin Yu’s realm increased, the power of the Divine Dragon seemed to increase as well!

With the support of the power of the Divine Dragon, the two of them were unable to determine who was stronger!

The more he teng fought, the more shocked he became. He knew his current strength very well!

That was an ability that was close to a martial saint!

However, even so, he was unable to easily take down Qin Yu. How could he not be anxious!

“If this child were to become a martial saint, how terrifying would he be?”That hoarse voice sounded in his mind.

Although he teng did not want to admit it, it was the truth.

“Boom!”

After a round of fist and Foot Exchange, cracks appeared on Qin Yu’s body!

He Teng’s condition was not any better. His body was smashed into the black fog and he could not walk out for a long time.

Qin Yu stared at the Black Fog not far away and his expression became increasingly grave.

In a short period of time, it seemed that the two of them were evenly matched.

But he teng was taking the initiative to fight with his body!

If he avoided the advantage of his body, the gap between the two would instantly widen.

“Keke Keke...”

He Teng’s strange voice once again came from all directions.

This black fog seemed to be his body!

Qin Yu hurriedly swept his surroundings, and his body ignited with spiritual fire.

“No wonder the Jingdu martial arts association values you so much. Your strength really can not be underestimated...”he teng muttered in a low voice.

“In the face of the invincible martial saint, if you step into the martial saint realm, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association might really become history...”

“If you want to fight, then fight. There’s no need to talk nonsense,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“Hehehe...”

He Teng’s strange voice pierced straight into his ears.

“I can be considered to have rendered meritorious service to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association...”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. Just as he was about to speak, the surrounding Black Fog suddenly surged towards Qin Yu!

Balls of black fog arrived in front of Qin Yu in the blink of an eye!

Qin Yu’s vision instantly turned pitch black, and a foul smell pierced straight into his nostrils.

He covered his nose and shouted, “He teng, come out if you have the ability!”

“I am right in front of you...”He Teng said darkly.

“And you... are about to be swallowed by me...”

As he spoke, the black fog covered Qin Yu’s body!

The Black Fog stuck closely to Qin Yu’s body like a huge abyss mouth, as if it was going to Swallow Qin Yu!

Qin Yu did not dare to be negligent. He shouted loudly and punched forward with both fists.

Under Qin Yu’s fists, the black fog dispersed in all directions, but in the blink of an eye, it condensed again!

“Not good!”Qin Yu had a bad premonition in his heart!

This black fog was too strange!

Qin Yu hurriedly urged the shrinking ground to become an inch, intending to pull away, but the black fog was tightly lying on Qin Yu’s body, unable to move at all!

“Oh no!”Qin Yu could clearly feel that his movements were being restricted bit by bit, and his speed was also becoming slower and slower!

No matter how Qin Yu struggled, he was unable to stop the erosion of the Black Fog!

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu’s entire body was enveloped by the Black Fog!

Looking from the outside world, one could only see a huge and strange black ball!

And in the middle of this black ball was Qin Yu!

Jiang he could not help but frown. He tried to break through this level of black fog from the outside, but all of his moves quickly disappeared after entering the Black Fog!

In the Black Fog, Qin Yu struggled desperately.

His body was rotting bit by bit.

His skin, bones, and even his spiritual sense seemed to be merging into the Black Fog!

This was the devouring technique he teng was talking about!

“Ah! ! !”

Qin Yu raised his head and roared furiously. His internal Qi erupted, wanting to forcefully break through the layers of Black Fog!

But unfortunately, under the Black Fog, Qin Yu was unable to use any of his cultivation techniques!

His body was being devoured bit by bit.

First, his arm was broken bit by bit. Then, the sparkling and translucent white bones also used wisps of black light to disperse into the black fog.

“Comfortable... comfortable! This is the feeling! Devour him completely and turn him into my nourishment!”

He Teng’s voice continued to roar in the black gas!

“Ah! ! !”Qin Yu’s face also began to be eroded!

If this continued, Qin Yu might really be completely corroded by the black gas!

His arms were gradually bound, and his physical body even lost the ability to move.

Every part of his body was turning into black light, merging into he Teng’s Black Qi.

In the blink of an eye, half of his body was about to disappear!

“It’s useless, stop struggling. You should be happy that you can become my nourishment...”he teng sneered.

“Don’t worry, I will make good use of your strength...”

How Could Qin Yu listen to his Bullsh * t? He gritted his teeth and tried his best to mobilize the internal QI in his body.

“Dou... Dou character formula!”

At this critical moment, Qin Yu used all the strength in his body to activate the Dou character formula of the nine secrets!

The Dou character formula could provide at least ten times the strength! The effect it brought was extremely terrifying!
