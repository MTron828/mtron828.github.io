With just a wave of Qin Yu’s hand, Yu Jin’s fierce attack was neutralized! He was even knocked to the ground!

Lying on the ground, Yu Jin couldn’t stop vomiting blood. He felt bursts of pain in his chest!

“Xiao Yu!” Commander Guo, his expression full of anxiety, hurriedly stood up.

“Don’t worry, he just has a broken rib.” Qin Yu drank a mouthful of tea and said indifferently.

Commander Guo’s expression didn’t look pleasant and he said unhappily, “Qin Yu, even if you want to prove yourself, you don’t have to be so ruthless.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. Just as he was about to speak, Yu Jin, who wasn’t far away, suddenly shouted, “Commander Guo! This has nothing to do with Mr. Qin. I admit defeat!”

After saying that, Yu Jin climbed up from the ground with difficulty and cupped his hands toward Qin Yu. “Mr. Qin, I was rude earlier. I hope you can forgive me.”

This surprised Qin Yu a little. The contrast in his attitude made him seem like a different person.

He sized up Yu Jin and said with a smile, “Aren’t you angry that I hurt you?”

Yu Jin shook his head and said, “I was the one who provoked you first. Moreover, I think you have already shown mercy.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I only used thirty percent of my strength.”

When he heard this, Yu Jin forced a smile.

“I was too arrogant and ignorant.” Yu Jin said with a forced smile.

Qin Yu admired Yu Jin’s attitude.

Although Yu Jin was arrogant, he acknowledged his mistake and admitted his loss. He was at least high-minded.

Commander Guo also shook his head and said, “This is how his character is. He only admires the strong.”

Qin Yu bowed and said, “Please wait a moment, Officer Yu.”

Then, Qin Yu turned around and returned to his room.

He took out a few herbs from the warehouse and opened his palm. A wisp of spiritual fire flickered in his palm.

Qin Yu flicked his finger and the flame fell into the tool.

With the support of the spiritual fire, Qin Yu’s pill refining speed was several times faster. Unfortunately, it was too unstable. After Qin Yu refined it many times, the herbs were all destroyed.

Finally, on the sixth time, Qin Yu successfully refined the Dieda Pill.

“D*mn, it’s really difficult to control the spiritual fire.” Qin Yu wipe his sweat.

Then, Qin Yu took the Dieda Pill and walked out.

He handed the Dieda Pill to Yu Jin and said with a smile, “Take it, and the pain in your body will disappear.”

Yu Jin took the Dieda Pill and swallowed it dubiously.

A few minutes later, the pain in his chest disappeared without a trace.

“It actually worked!” The admiration on Yu Jin’s expression intensified!

He immediately cupped his hands and said, “Mr. Qin, I, Yu Jin, sincerely admit defeat to you. I was mistaken earlier, so I apologize to you sincerely.”

Qin Yu waved his hand to show that he didn’t mind.

Then, Qin Yu said, “Take this Dieda Pill once a day. In three days at most, your ribs will be as good as new.”

“Thank you, Mr. Qin,” Yu Jin said sincerely.

Commander Guo sighed and said, “It seems that Commander Wu is right. He really has both medicine and martial arts skills! Qin Yu, our trip wasn’t in vain!”

However, Qin Yu fell into silence.

After a while, Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Commander Guo, I’m sorry. I’m not interested in joining the military district. Please go back and tell Chief Wu that I thank him for his kind intentions.”

Commander Guo felt stunned. Then, he said jokingly, “Qin Yu, you can put on airs, but you can’t keep playing hard to get.”

Yu Jin, who was at the side, said anxiously, “Mr. Qin, are you blaming me? If that’s the case, I’m willing to be punished by you!”

Qin Yu hurriedly shook his head and said, “It has nothing to do with you. It’s just that I’m used to enjoyng freedom, so I don’t like to be restrained. I’m sorry.”

Commander Guo was silent for a moment and then said, “Qin Yu, you have to consider it carefully. Joining the Military District will bring you no harm.”

“Thank you for your kind intentions. I won’t consider joining the military district for the time being. I’m sorry.” Qin Yu refused repeatedly.

Commander Guo could only sigh and say, “It seems that I won’t be able to fulfill the task.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. Whether or not Commander Guo fulfilled his task had nothing to do with him.

It was not suitable for Qin Yu to join the military district. Although there were more resources in the military district, there were also many restrictions.

The most important reason was that Qin Yu felt that even if he went to the military district now, he might not be taken seriously.

Commander Guo didn’t say anything more. After drinking the last cup of tea, Commander Guo left in a hurry with Yu Jing.

After returning, Commander Guo quickly told the Deputy Chief about Qin Yu’s attitude.

The Deputy Chief was a little shocked by Qin Yu’s rejection. After all, many people strived to join the military district.

“I’ll invite him personally,” said the Deputy Chief on the other end.

When he heard this, Commander Guo said in surprise, “Deputy Chief, Qin Yu is capable, but he isn’t worthy of us making such a big fuss, is he?”

The Deputy Chief smiled nonchalantly and said, “You don’t understand. Qin Yu is far more than just capable.”

“According to what we know, that Inner Strength Past Master from overseas died at Qin Yu’s hands not long ago.”

“Inner Strength Past Master?” Commander Guo’s expression suddenly changed.

“Are you kidding me? Judging from his aura, Qin Yu is only an Inner Strength Master Hands. How could he win against a Inner Strength Past Master...” Commander Guo said awkwardly.

Although he wasn’t a martial artist, he understood the gap between the two.

The Deputy Chief laughed and said, “This is why we value him. We won’t value an Inner Strength Master Hands that much. However, there are very few Inner Strength Master Hands who can defeat a Inner Strength Past Master.”

“As far as I know, other than Ye Qing back then, no one else has been able to achieve this,” the Deputy Chief said.

Ye Qing?

Commander Guo swallowed hard.

“Deputy Chief, isn’t your evaluation a little too high... Ye Qing is a legend in the Military District...” Commander Guo said with some incredulity. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The Deputy Chief laughed and said, “He isn’t as capable as Ye Qing now, but his future is full of potential. Moreover... Qin Yu even knows how to refine medicine. The Soul Nourishment Pill that he made is now all the rage in the province. The Ministry of Commerce is planning to focus on supporting the business.

At this point, the Deputy Chief paused for a moment before continuing, “Oh right, it just so happens that you will accompany me to his factory tomorrow to observe.”

“Okay!” Commander Guo didn’t say anything more and simply agreed.

...

At night, Qin Yu sat alone in the courtyard.

Wisps of flames were flickering in his palms, and in front of him were many ordinary herbs.

These herbs were all meticulously prepared by Lei Hu. Although they weren’t considered exquisite, they were very suitable for practice.

“Whoosh”

A breeze blew past, and the herbs in front of Qin Yu were burned into dregs by the spiritual fire.

“I failed again.” Looking at the ashes in front of him, Qin Yu forced a smile.

Qin Yu had just produced the spiritual fire, so he wasn’t familiar with how to control the fire. He had only succeeded once in more than ten times of refining medicine.

“With such instability, it’s very likely that an accident will occur at the Chinese Medical Conference.” Qin Yu thought to himself.

It was less than a week before the Chinese Medical Conference. It was almost impossible to improve his control in such a short time.

“It seems that I should use ordinary flames for the time being.” Qin Yu forced a smile.

Although the speed was a little slower, at least it was safe.

Qin Yu didn’t sleep the whole night, and Yao Qing didn’t come back.

The next morning, Qin Yu set off for the factory.

The Chinese Medicine Conference was getting closer and closer. Qin Yu wanted to find Mr. Yang to find out about some details of it.

During this period of time, Mr. Yang spent almost all his time in the factory. With Qin Yu’s pill formula, Mr. Yang was able to obtain the Soul Nourishment Pill with ease.

Soon, Qin Yu’s car arrived at the factory’s entrance.

However, just as he arrived at the entrance, Qin Yu saw that there were many people standing at the entrance. The one leading them was none other than Su Bo.
