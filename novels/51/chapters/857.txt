Chapter 858: Chapter 858, the day of the new year!

The Luo father and son were dumbstruck as they swallowed their saliva.

They did not dare to imagine that three half-step martial saints would die in front of Qin Yu just like that!

What level had Qin Yu’s cultivation reached now?

Why was his progress so fast?

Qin Yu walked up to the three people, dug out their golden cores, and put them into his spatial divine weapon.

Then, Qin Yu looked at Luo Jingyu coldly.

“Take out the Qiankun stone, and I’ll spare your life,”Qin Yu said indifferently while sitting on the sofa.

Luo Jingyu came back to his senses and said, “The Qiankun Stone was passed down by our ancestors. If...”

“I don’t want to listen to nonsense. The Qiankun Stone is not necessary for me. Either you hand it over, or I don’t want it anymore,”Qin Yu’s tone was full of threat.

Luo Jingyu gritted his teeth and said, “If you want the Qiankun Stone, that’s fine. But I have a request. Return the spatial God weapon that you stole, and I’ll give you the Qiankun Stone!”

“You don’t have the right to negotiate,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“I want both the Qiankun Stone and the spatial god weapon.”

Luo Jingyu said angrily, “Qin Yu, are you being unreasonable? ! Aren’t you going too far? !”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and raised his hand to slap Luo Jingyu’s face.

“Pay attention to your tone when talking to me,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Luo Jingyu opened his mouth and was speechless.

He never thought that he would have such a day!

Luo Jingyu couldn’t help but glare at Luo Yang. If it weren’t for him, he wouldn’t have provoked Qin Yu!

“My patience is limited, so I’ll only give you three seconds. If you don’t make a decision in three seconds, I’ll kill you,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Luo Jingyu knew that he wouldn’t be able to escape, so he could only bite the bullet and say, “Okay, I’ll give it to you!”

After saying this, Luo Jingyu suddenly took out a spatial magic tool and planned to escape!

A black hole appeared in front of him!

Luo Jingyu pulled Luo Yang Up and was about to run away!

However, Qin Yu stretched out his palm and slapped forward.

“Boom!”

The black hole’s entrance was directly smashed into pieces, and the spatial magic tool also exploded!

This instantly made the Luo father and son’s back feel a chill!

“Do you know the consequences of playing with me?”Qin Yu’s body emitted waves of coldness.

Luo Jingyu was instantly scared out of his wits. He hurriedly said, “I’m the one who’s obsessed. I... I’ll go get the Cosmic Stone for You Now!”

Qin Yu coldly said, “You’ve already played with me once. If there’s a second time, you know the consequences.”

“I don’t dare, I don’t dare...”Luo Jingyu said with a trembling voice.

He turned around and quickly left the room. Ten minutes later, Luo Jingyu came back with a sandalwood box.

“This... This is the Qiankun Stone,”Luo Jingyu said reluctantly.

Qin Yu took it and opened the box. He saw a palm-sized stone lying quietly in the box.

“This is the Qiankun Stone?”Qin Yu sized it up carefully.

The stone emitted a faint light and a strange power surrounded it.

Qin Yu put the Qiankun Stone back into the box and then put it away.

Luo Jingyu’s heart was bleeding. He gritted his teeth, wishing that he could kill Qin Yu.

“Luo Jingyu, do you know why I spared your life?”Qin Yu suddenly asked.

Luo Jingyu shook his head, indicating that he didn’t know.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He shook his palm, and the bronze sword fell in front of Luo Jingyu.

“You’re a blacksmith. Help Me Forge this sword properly,”Qin Yu said.

This sword had fused with the bones of a mighty figure. Unfortunately, Qin Yu’s refining technique wasn’t exquisite enough, so he couldn’t bring out the effects it had.

Luo Jingyu took the bronze sword and carefully examined it.

“Black iron, essence stones, and... The skull of a mighty figure!”Luo Jingyu stroked the bronze sword and muttered in a low voice.

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said with a smile, “You have some ability. How about it? Is there any possibility to improve this sword?” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Luo Jingyu said in a deep voice, “Yes, and the space is very big.”

Qin Yu stood up and said, “Then I’ll leave it to you. I’ll come to you to get the sword after the New Year.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and left.

After Qin Yu left, Luo Yang hurriedly asked, “Dad, he took the space God weapon and the Qiankun Stone. Are we going to let it go just like that?”

Hearing this, Luo Jingyu slapped Luo Yang’s face!

“If it weren’t for you, you bastard, how could our pavilion of heavenly secrets suffer such a heavy loss?”Luo Jingyu said through gritted teeth.

Luo Yang covered his face and didn’t dare to say a word.

“This Qin Yu is no longer someone we can deal with. Unless there’s a martial saint in the world, no one can stop him!”Luo Jingyu said coldly.

Luo Yang gritted his teeth and said: “The Jingdu Martial Arts Association will definitely not let him off.”

“Let’s Hope so.”Luo Jingyu sighed.

... . .

The statement that Qin Yu had made on the martial arts forum was still continuing to ferment.

Because Qin Yu had only mentioned the name of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, they were not overly flustered.

Moreover, it was the New Year’s Eve, so they were not in the mood to care about anything else.

The fire country’s New Year’s Eve was always extremely peaceful and peaceful.

Everyone seemed to have put down their grudges at the same time. All their grudges would be settled after the new year.

However, there was one person who was an exception, and that was Qin Yu.

At this moment, Qin Yu had returned to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

He had used the cosmic stone as the core of the killing formation and had handed over the authority of the killing formation to the pavilion master.

“With this killing formation, I believe that even a half-step martial saint would find it difficult to get even half a step closer.”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Although he had said so, there were still some flaws in this formation.

That was, once they encountered a top formation master and destroyed the core of the formation, the formation would naturally break.

Therefore, Qin Yu set the core of the formation in an extremely hidden place.

“There’s still a week before the New Year,”the pavilion master said in a low voice from the pavilion master’s building.

Qin Yu grunted and muttered, “This is destined to be an extraordinary year.”

“If you don’t have anywhere else to go, then stay in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion,”said the pavilion master.

Qin Yu glanced at Yan Ruoxue who was lying in the medicinal pool. His heart was not only throbbing with pain.

Every time it was the New Year and the New Year, he would miss his beloved even more deeply.

Qin Yu was the same. He took a deep breath and shook his head, “No, I want to go to the northwest.”

“Go to the northwest for what?”The pavilion master asked doubtfully.

Qin Yu said coldly, “The slaughterhouse, the northwest, the Lei family.”

“It’s almost the new year. It’s better to wait until after the New Year. Otherwise, it will easily provoke public anger.”The pavilion master suggested.

Qin Yu glanced at the pavilion master and said, “No, not only do I want to make a move, I also want to make a move on the new year’s Day.”

“I just want them to know that once they provoke me, I will not have any bottom line!”
