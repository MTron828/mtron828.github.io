1762 Defeat

That terrifying scene came crushing down on Xiao Sheng!

Both of Xiao Sheng’s hands were emitting an extremely pure and holy light!

Just as the scene was about to crush him, Xiao Sheng suddenly raised his palm!

At this moment, his hands burst out with an extremely bright light!

He supported the small world with both hands, as if he wanted to push it back!

“Boom, boom, boom...”

The two sides clashed at this moment. After all, that small world was the ancient Immortal Slaying Sect, so its power was naturally self-evident.

The aura on Xiao Sheng’s body was rapidly climbing, and the aura in his body was flowing through his body and into his hands!

The small world sank and was pushed back at times.

This seemed to be a long process, and no one dared to say the result before it ended!

Wen Wanchong and the others broke out in cold sweat. If Xiao Sheng was defeated today, the entire Nanzhou would fall!

“Don’t worry, he won’t lose.” Xiao Hai suddenly said.

They looked at Xiao Hai and saw that he was extremely calm.

“I’ve never seen him lose.” Xiao Hai continued.

Wen Wanchong sighed and mumbled, “Although I’ve always looked down on him, I have to admit that his strength is indeed something that we can’t even catch up to.”

Xiao Sheng’s strength was enough to shake the entire Nanzhou. Other than Xiao Hai, no one else could be compared to him!

After reaching the Reversion Void Stage, he was not afraid of the secret techniques of Yuan Xiu. He could only rely on his own strength to resist them!

Compared to Xiao Hai’s wildness, Xiao Sheng was much more elegant.

Each of his moves was rather calm, without the slightest ripple.

However, the power it contained was so powerful that it was terrifying!

“Boom, boom, boom...”

As his aura burst forth, the small world began to tremble!

Through this scene, everyone seemed to be able to see a corner of the ancient Immortal Slaying Sect!

It was as if the scene of the terrifying sect’s decline from its glory was about to be presented in this scene!

“Crack!”

At this moment, the Immortal Slaying Sect’s plaque fell to the ground and turned into powder!

Then, the entire huge sect started to rumble and slowly disappeared!

The entire small world was trembling non-stop, as if it had reached its limit!

“Swish!”

An extremely dazzling light burst forth from Xiao Sheng’s palm!

As the light flickered, the entire small world began to collapse!

Crack after crack appeared on the scene, like glass that was about to break!

“Crack!”

With a crisp sound, the scene finally couldn’t bear it anymore and began to collapse into countless pieces!

These fragments floated in the air and finally slowly disappeared, as if they had merged into the surrounding void.

This seemed to indicate that the Immortal Slaying Sect would never be destroyed. Even if the sect was destroyed, it would still leave an inheritance!

“Boom!”

The moment the scene disappeared, an extremely terrifying explosion was heard!

A terrifying power instantly exploded forth. Xiao Sheng, who was in the center of the storm, was unable to dodge in time and was forced back countless steps. His snow-white clothes were stained with blood!

“This Yuan Xiu.” Seeing this, everyone couldn’t help but curse.

His moves were extremely cunning, and he always had a backup plan.

Very quickly, the surroundings became quiet.

Xiao Sheng’s body was covered in wounds, but his expression did not change in the slightest.

The pain did not seem to be worth mentioning. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Where is Yuan Xiu?”

Wen Wanchong suddenly shouted.

Looking around, there was no trace of Yuan Xiu.

Not to mention Yuan Xiu, even the heavily injured Sima Bei, Yong Ji, and the others had disappeared without a trace!

“This guy... He actually escaped again!” Wen Wanchong could not help but clench his teeth.

“He’s lived for so many years, how could he die so easily?” Qu Zhu shook his head.

“We can’t give him any breathing space, or he’ll definitely make a comeback,” Xiao Hai said in a deep voice.

“That’s right.” Qu Zhu also nodded slightly.

In any case, this battle was considered a victory, even though they paid a considerable price.

As for whether Yuan Xiu would make a comeback in the future, no one knew.

At this moment, Xiao Sheng walked over from a distance.

His eyes fell on Xiao Hai. There was no expression on his face, so no one could guess what he was thinking.

Their eyes met, and neither of them spoke.

“Let’s make a move first.” Qu Zhu said.

They nodded. They knew that the two brothers probably had a lot to say.

Thus, the group of people carried Qin Yu and turned to leave.

“Let’s go to Tianyun Sect first.”

Xiao Sheng finally spoke after a long time.

Xiao Hai was silent for a moment before he finally nodded and said, “Alright,” he said.

Xiao Sheng picked up Xiao Hai and turned to leave.

After this battle, the Divine Capital City had been completely reduced to ruins. Even the Divine Inscription Formation had been destroyed.

The city, which was originally a desert, had completely become a no man’s land.

The people who were watching the battle in the dark shook their heads and sighed.

“I didn’t expect Xiao Hai to appear again at this critical moment.”

“That’s right. He’s only at the half-step Reversion Void Stage, but he’s actually able to hold off Yuan Xiu.”

“Tsk, tsk. Nanzhou is full of talents. First, there were the Xiao brothers, and then there was Qin Yu. This Qin Yu actually managed to drag Xiao Hai back.”

“I just don’t know if Qin Yu is still alive.”

...

In the North Plain.

Yuan Xiu fled in a sorry state. His aura was already extremely weak, and the injuries on his body were unbearable.

Along the way, Yuan Xiu did not dare to take a break. He only heaved a sigh of relief when he fell out of the teleportation formation.

The North Plain looked extremely cold and sullen.

Sima Bei, Yong Ji, and He Teng were standing there, waiting for Yuan Xiu.

The few of them did not say anything when they saw the pathetic state Yuan Xiu was in.

Sima Bei and Yong Ji’s conditions were not any better. Other than He Teng, everyone else seemed to have suffered fatal injuries.

“What are you still standing there for? Quickly take me to recuperate...” Yuan Xiu glared at He Teng and chided him.

He Teng’s eyes narrowed. He sneered in his heart, but he didn’t say anything.

He brought the three of them to a room. Yong Ji and Sima Bei could no longer move.

They were lying on the bed, their breathing extremely unstable.

As for Yuan Xiu, he was in no better condition. That technique seemed to have exhausted all of his energy.

“I didn’t expect that I would still fail in the end...” Yuan Xiu gritted his teeth, looking extremely indignant.

Then, he looked at He Teng and said coldly, “Why didn’t you do anything? What am I raising you for?”

“Lord, you must be joking,” He Teng said with a smile that was not a smile. “With my strength, what help can I be?”
