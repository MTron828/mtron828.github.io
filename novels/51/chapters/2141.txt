2142 The Crazy Qin Yu

However, this was far from over. Qin Yu gritted his teeth. The veins on his entire body bulged as if he still wanted to advance further!

“Fight… fighting word formula, level 7, activate!” Qin Yu raised his head and roared angrily. His voice almost shattered the void. At this moment, Qin Yu’s internal qi soared again. The surrounding Holy Power and dao technique continued to swirl!

Qin Yu’s internal qi had caught up to True Saint!

“Qin Yu!” On the ancient ship, Yan Ruoxue’s expression was tremendously unsightly. She knew Qin Yu was risking his life by forcefully activating these two techniques. It was very likely that it would affect his foundation and even his life!

However, Qin Yu no longer cared at this moment. No matter what price he had to pay, he had to kill this linen-robed elderly man!

The linen-robed elderly man’s expression was cold. He finally sensed a trace of danger at this moment.

“You’re trully… a shocking fellow…” The linen-robed elderly man took a deep breath, and his expression became even more solemn.

“Unfortunately, as long as you are not True Saint…”

“Ten Thousand Spell Breaking Punch!” Just as the linen-robed elder was still chattering, Qin Yu had already let out an explosive roar. He held the Golden Fist in his hand and came over. It was the Ten Thousand Spell Breaking Punch the moment he raised his hand!

Qin Yu’s punch was like the most overbearing existence in the world. It was like the fist of an ancient god and demon. It was incomparably ferocious and shocking.

In an instant, the sky changed color, and the void trembled. Golden light surged like a raging wave. Thousands of divine lights shot out simultaneously as if they wanted to tear the entire world apart.

This punch seemed to contain an ancient and endless power. It was powerful enough to sweep away everything and crush all techniques. That powerful internal qi caused the entire world to fall silent and tremble.

The space that the fist swept through seemed to have frozen. Light and darkness, time and space, everything seemed to have stopped at this moment. Only the golden fist was like a storm that tore through everything. It carried unparalleled power as it violently and domineeringly crashed into the linen-robed elderly man.

The surrounding air was instantly compressed, causing a loud explosion. The entire world seemed to be trembling under this punch.

Each golden light was like a sharp sword, tearing the void apart. The piercing sound and impact seemed to be in every corner of the world.

Ten Thousand Spell Breaking Punch was not just a description by words but truly displayed in this world. That boundless power seemed to be able to tear everything apart, and nothing could stop it.

The entire world seemed to tremble under this punch. Countless ways shone and responded at this moment. It was as if this punch was the punch of the world, the punch of a thousand ways, the punch of annihilation, and the punch of creation.

The linen-robed elderly man’s expression changed drastically! He did not expect Qin Yu to suddenly make a move, and it was so terrifying!

The linen-robed elderly man hurriedly raised his hand to respond. Soon complicated formations formed on his palm and condensed into an endless barrier, wanting to block Qin Yu’s punch.

However, Qin Yu’s fist was like a meteor that broke through the sky. The boundless power directly shattered the formation of the linen-robed elderly man. Bright cracks quickly spread in the air, and the incredible force seemed to have torn the void apart.

Qin Yu’s fist immediately collided with the elderly man’s body. With a deafening sound, the elderly man’s body was thrown out like a rag, and the strong impact made him roll in the air.

However, it did not end there. Qin Yu followed closely behind the linen-robed elderly man’s figure. His fists were like thunder, one punch after another. Every punch seemed to be able to shake mountains and rivers, shocking people.

The linen-robed elderly man wanted to resist, but each time, he found his defense was torn apart like thin paper. His body kept rolling in the air. Each time he came into contact with Qin Yu’s fist, he could deeply feel the irresistible power that caused his body to suffer in pain.

However, Qin Yu did not stop at all. His fist followed closely behind the linen-robed elderly man like a hunting wolf, never letting go of any prey.

“Qin Yu, you…” The linen-robed elderly man struggled in the air. He tried to say something but was mercilessly interrupted by Qin Yu’s fist each time he opened his mouth.

At this moment, Qin Yu only thought of defeating the linen-robed elderly man. No matter what price he had to pay, he would not allow the linen-robed elderly man to escape.

The linen-robed elderly man gritted his teeth. He could only form a chant with his hand, activate a technique, and continuously smash it at Qin Yu to delay his attack.

However, at this moment, Qin Yu was fighting with all his might. He did not have any defense at all, allowing the linen-robed elderly man’s techniques to smash onto his body! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“You’ve gone crazy!” The linen-robed elderly man spat out a mouthful of blood. He could even sense the threat of death!

On the ancient ship, Yan Ruoxue looked at the scene in the sky and was silent. They could feel Qin Yu’s madness and unstoppable determination.

Qin Yu bombarded the elderly man with punch after punch, and the elderly man was already in a completely passive position and kept retreating. Each of his counterattacks could not cause any substantial damage to Qin Yu. He could not even stop Qin Yu’s attacks.

“No, I can’t continue like this. I have to find a way to break it.” The linen-robed elderly man snorted coldly in his heart. He used all his might to resist the air of Qin Yu’s fist, and at the same time, quickly thought in his heart.

Looking at him, Qin Yu’s eyes filled with determination. He knew he could not hesitate at this moment. Only with a full-powered attack could he completely defeat the linen-robed elderly man.

“Let everything end!” Qin Yu gritted her teeth and gathered all the strength in his body. The eighth level of the fighting word formula instantly erupted. The powerful internal qi directly changed the color of the world and swept toward the linen-robed elderly man like a storm.

The linen-robed elderly man only felt a golden light in front of his eyes. Qin Yu’s figure instantly disappeared from his sight. In the next moment, an unstoppable destructive force had already blasted toward his chest.

His body was almost smashed into pieces, and several of his bones were broken. He fell to the ground and panted heavily, looking terrible.

Even his internal qi seemed to have become a little weak. When he fell to the ground, it was extremely difficult for him to move.

However, Qin Yu was already in a killing frenzy. Her fists were like raindrops that kept smashing down.

If the outside world saw this, they would definitely be shocked!

It was unheard of for a SEmi-Saint to beat a True Saint to such a sorry state!

Although Qin Yu had gone mad in his heart, he did not lose his mind. The most important thing now was to escape from this place as soon as possible to avoid being caught by the Yan family.

“I’ll let you off this time. Next time… I will definitely kill you personally!” Qin Yu said coldly.

After saying this, Qin Yu hurriedly returned to the ancient ship.
