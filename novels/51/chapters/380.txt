Yan Sihai’s body gave off a murderous aura, and the atmosphere was tense!

“Sihai, let the Pavilion Master treat my daughter’s illness first.” Yan Yongxiu’s voice also became somewhat cold.

Yan Sihai glanced at Yan Yongxiu and snickered. “Alright, but I warn you, it’s best not to play any tricks!”

With that said, Yan Sihai turned his head and left.

“Pavilion Master, thank you for your trouble.” Yan Yongxiu cupped his hands and said.

The Pavilion Master nodded slightly and then said, “You guys can leave first.”

After sending everyone away, only the Pavilion Master and Yan Ruoxue were left in the room.

The Pavilion Master walked to Yan Ruoxue’s side. She raised her hand and gently placed it on Yan Ruoxue’s forehead.

Then, waves of spiritual energy flowed through Yan Ruoxue’s head and entered her entire body.

This method was quite similar to Qin Yu’s.

A moment later, Yan Ruoxue’s expression eased up a lot.

She sat up from the bed and said somewhat weakly, “You are the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?”

The Pavilion Master nodded slightly and said, “Lie down first.”

Yan Ruoxue grabbed the Pavilion Master’s arm somewhat excitedly and said, “Is Qin Yu okay now? I’ll have to trouble you to pass a message to him. No matter what, don’t come to Jingdu!”

Hearing this, the Pavilion Master immediately fell silent.

“Qin Yu also asked me to pass on a message to you,” said the Pavilion Master.

Yan Ruoxue, her eyes filled with a bit of nervousness and anticipation, looked at the Pavilion Master.

“He said to let you rest assured that this half a year’s time is enough for him to grow up and become capable enough to go against the Yan family,” said the Pavilion Master.

“On September 9th, he will come and take you away.”

“He also said... that he will take back the Yan family for you and Old Mister Yan.”

After hearing what the Pavilion Master said, Yan Ruoxue couldn’t help but laugh with tears. “This fool... I don’t care about the Yan family...”

“But he does,” the Pavilion Master said quietly.

“Qin Yu won’t let you suffer with him, nor will he let you lose your family and social status because of him.”

Yan Ruoxue looked at the Pavilion Master in a daze and couldn’t help but cry.

“Half a year... What can change in half a year?” A moment later, Yan Ruoxue said with a bitter smile.

“Take care of yourself. Believe in him. His body contains an unimaginable amount of energy,” the Pavilion Master said indifferently.

Yan Ruoxue was silent for a moment, and then she nodded. “I believe in him.”

While the two were chatting, Yan Sihai was secretly plotting.

In Jingdu, the Yan family had extreme power.

Not to mention that the Han family was also involved.

At this moment, Yan Sihai was sitting together with Han Meng.

“The Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion actually dares to come to Jingdu...” Han Meng narrowed his eyes and muttered softly.

Yan Sihai coldly said, “This is like a lamb entering a tiger’s den. After she finishes treating Yan Ruoxue’s illness, I will immediately send people to take action!”

Han Meng frowned and said, “Mr. Yan, what do you plan to do?”

Yan Sihai snickered and said, “The Divine Alchemist Pavilion doesn’t have the slightest regard for our family, and has even provoked us many times.”

“Now that she has come to Jingdu alone, how can I let her off?!”

Han Meng said in a deep voice, “Mr. Yan, the Divine Alchemist Pavilion can’t be dealt with. If she dies, Jingdu will probably have a huge uproar.”

“You have to know that many people’s health is in the hands of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. Do you think that if she dies, the higher-ups will let it slide?”

Yan Sihai snickered. “Anyone can be replaced, and she is no exception.”

“That’s true, but... can anyone take her place now?” Han Meng said.

Yan Sihai also fell silent.

Just as Han Meng had said, although he didn’t want to admit it, he had to admit that the medical skills of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s Pavilion Master were well-known. It could even be said that she was publicly acknowledged as number one.

At least, at the moment, no one could take her place to take control of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

“This is a good opportunity. I definitely won’t miss it.” After thinking about it, Yan Sihai snorted coldly.

Han Meng hurriedly said, “Mr. Yan, you still have to be cautious about this matter.”

“Don’t worry. I know what to do.” Yan Sihai narrowed his eyes and said.

...

The sky gradually darkened.

With the Pavilion Master’s treatment, Yan Ruoxue’s body instantly became much better.

She was only mentally ill. Now that she knew that Qin Yu was fine, Yan Ruoxue’s bodily health naturally improved.

The Pavilion Master personally refined a few pills for Yan Ruoxue. These few pills were used to maintain bodily health.

“Pavilion Master, please help me pass on a message to Qin Yu,” Yan Ruoxue said softly.

The Pavilion Master nodded, indicating for Yan Ruoxue to speak.

Yan Ruoxue bit her rosy lips with her white teeth and said softly, “Before he has absolute strength, don’t step into Jingdu, and don’t take any risks.”

Hearing this, the Pavilion Master smiled nonchalantly and said, “Do you think he will listen?”

Yan Ruoxue opened her mouth, but was immediately speechless.

“If I were you, I would choose to believe in him,” the Pavilion Master said indifferently.

Of course, Yan Ruoxue believed in Qin Yu, but she was well aware of the strength of the Yan family and knew that the Yan family couldn’t be shaken by one person.

For Yan Ruoxue, as long as Qin Yu was alive, it was enough.

“Don’t worry. On September 9th, he will definitely take you away,” the Pavilion Master said with a nonchalant smile.

Yan Ruoxue gritted her teeth and said, “Then I’ll have to trouble the Pavilion Master to help me tell him that... I’ll wait for him.”

Following that, Yan Ruoxue took out a bank card from under her pillow.

She stuffed the bank card into the Pavilion Master’s hands and said, “There’s some money in here. I’ll have to trouble the Pavilion Master to help me bring it to Qin Yu.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The Pavilion Master accepted the bank card and nodded. “Got it.”

The Pavilion Master didn’t stay any longer. After giving some instructions, she walked out of the bedroom.

“The Pavilion Master is going to leave now? Won’t that mean that the Yan family doesn’t know how to treat guests?”

Just as the Pavilion Master was about to leave the Yan family’s manor, a voice suddenly came from behind him.

She saw Yan Sihai standing behind her.

Beside him, there were more than ten peak-stage Inner Strength Grandmasters!

Even though they had restrained their internal qi, the internal qi on their bodies was still difficult to conceal.

There wasn’t a trace of panic on the Pavilion Master’s face. On the contrary, she was extremely calm.

She raised her head and glanced at the hidden gunmen around her. She said indifferently, “Mr. Yan, you really think too highly of me. Is it worth it to go to such great lengths just for me?”

Yan Sihai blew out a smoke ring and said with a nonchalant smile, “Of course. You are the famous Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

The Pavilion Master said with a nonchalant smile, “Do you want to kill me, President Yan?”

Yan Sihai laughed and said, “Don’t worry, Pavilion Master. I just want to treat you to a meal.”

“What if I don’t go?” The Pavilion Master raised her eyebrows and asked.

Yan Sihai said with a cold smile, “I advise you to cooperate a little. Otherwise... I can’t guarantee what I will do.”

As soon as he said that, the Inner Strength Grandmasters’ internal qi instantly burst out!

The terrifying strength of the internal qi caused a huge gust of wind to sweep across the entire Yan family’s home!

“Swoosh!”

Not only that, but even the gunmen in the shadows also rushed out in a row!

Dozens of people surrounded the Pavilion Master, and the pitch-black muzzle of their guns pointed straight at the Pavilion Master!
