Chapter 113: Su Yan’s Cousin Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Liu Shihui wasn’t shocked by everyone’s attitude.

He also knew that these people wouldn’t take such a risk for the Liu family.

Everyone left one after another. Liu Shihui couldn’t help but snort.

...

The next day, Qin Yu packed his things and prepared to rush to South City.

At this time, Yao Qing’s body had basically recovered. However, his legs were still a little wobbly, and he was limping when he walked.

“Hey, Mr. Qin, it’s time for us to buy a car.” On the way to the station, Yao Qing couldn’t help but mutter.

Qin Yu thought about it. It seemed that they did need to buy a car.

In the future, they would definitely go out more and more. It would be inconvenient to have a car.

“When we return this time, we’ll go and buy one,” Qin Yu said.

The two of them sat in the car heading to South City. On the way, Liu Shihui sent a message to Qin Yu. The content of the message was the address of the competition.

What surprised Qin Yu was that Liu Shihui chose a scenic area instead of an interior arena.

“It seems that Liu Shihui wants to make a big deal out of this so that the Yan family won’t hold him accountable,” Yao Qing muttered while looking at the phone.

Qin Yu snorted and said, “That’s what I want.”

Yao Qing scratched his head and said worriedly, “Mr. Qin, you have to be careful. Liu Shihui is different from ordinary people. His strength...”

“Don’t worry,” Qin Yu interrupted Yao Qing.

“It’s a piece of cake for me to beat him,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

Hearing this, Yao Qing didn’t say anything more, but he was still a bit worried.

After more than five hours, the car finally arrived at South City.

Qin Yu glanced at his phone and said, “Let’s take a taxi to the nearby area.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh. It was more convenient to have a car.

Then, Qin Yu and Yao Qing took a taxi on the roadside and rushed to their destination, the Water Dragon Cave.

This was a famous scenic spot in South City. It was supposedly spring all year round and countless people would come to soak in the hot spring every year.

“I advise you not to go to the Water Dragon Cave today,” the driver said while driving.

Qin Yu then asked, “Why?”

The driver said, “The Water Dragon Cave was requisitioned by the Liu family today. They’re going to compete with a man named Qin Yu. Even if you go there, you won’t be able to play.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

This Liu family really liked to requisition public places.

Cheng Lei did so last time, and the competition this time was so as well.

“I didn’t expect that even the taxi driver knew about this.” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“This matter has caused a stir in the city. It’s hard not to know about it,” the driver lamented.

“But then again, I really don’t know what Qin Yu is thinking. He actually dared to compete with Young Master Liu. He’s really crazy,” the driver continued to mutter.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Since he dared to challenge Liu Shihui, he naturally has confidence.”

The driver glanced at Qin Yu and sneered. “You must be from out of town, right?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “How do you know?”

The driver smiled and said, “Because the locals wouldn’t say such things. Who doesn’t know that Liu Shihui is a sly person?”

“Why do you say that?” Qin Yu asked with some puzzlement.

The driver explained, “As far as I know, over the years, Liu Shihui has arranged at least a dozen public tournaments, and each time, he won by a landslide. Do you know why?”

“I don’t know.” Qin Yu shook his head and gestured for the driver to continue.

The driver smiled and said, “Because Liu Shihui will always fight with people who are weaker than him. Liu Shihui acts very humble in front of those who are stronger than him, or those who have a more powerful background than the Liu family.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows and suddenly understood.

“Moreover, out of everyone who fought with Liu Shihui, who ended up well? The best case scenario is the ICU, and the worst case scenario is the crematorium,” the driver muttered.

“Just wait and see. Qin Yu will definitely be dead meat.” The driver hummed a tune, as if he was used to it.

The car soon arrived at the Water Dragon Cave.

The driver didn’t turn around and leave. Instead, he found a parking spot and parked the car.

Yao Qing glanced at him and said, “Why aren’t you leaving yet?”

The driver smiled and said, “I like to watch the fun as well. Of course, I can’t miss such a big event.”

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but smile and shake his head.

“Let’s go.” Qin Yu shook his head and said.

Then, the two of them walked towards the Water Dragon Cave.

The Water Dragon Cave scenic area occupied an extremely large area, and the most famous of them was the natural hot spring.

In front of them, there was an extremely large natural hot spring that was steaming hot.

It was said that the scenery here was the same in winter. One could hardly feel the cold all year round.

At this time, this place had been isolated. Seven to eight people were in charge of guarding it to prevent anyone from approaching.

Qin Yu and Yao Qing stood outside the isolation line and looked at the Water Dragon Cave in front of them.

“How strange.” Qin Yu frowned slightly and murmured in a low voice.

“Mr. Qin, what’s wrong?” Yao Qing asked.

Qin Yu pointed in the direction of the Water Dragon Cave and said, “I keep feeling that the water here isn’t quite normal. I can even feel a trace of spiritual energy from the hot air.”

“Spiritual energy?” Yao Qing was stunned. He had obviously never heard of this term before.

Qin Yu didn’t explain. He stared at the Water Dragon Cave and said in a low voice, “Could it be that there is something hidden under the water?”

“Gee, Qin Yu, it really is you.” At this moment, a voice suddenly came from behind Qin Yu.

After turning his head, Qin Yu saw a beautiful girl in her twenties standing behind him.

Beside her were three to four young men of similar age.

“Sun Ying?” Seeing this girl, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

This girl was Su Yan’s cousin. She used to be Qin Yu’s sister-in-law, and she went to university in South City.

Back when Qin Yu was still in the Su family, Sun Ying had always looked down on Qin Yu. She ridiculed Qin Yu and even ordered him around like a servant.

He didn’t expect to meet her here today.

“Sun Ying, the person who is competing with Young Master Liu today is also called Qin Yu. It can’t be him, right?” A young girl beside Sun Ying asked with her eyes widened.

Sun Ying sneered. “How is that possible? Qin Yu is a good-for-nothing who only knows how to do laundry and cook. How can he be the same person as that Qin Yu?”

Upon hearing Sun Ying’s words, the people around couldn’t help but snicker.

“Why are you talking to Mr. Qin?” Yao Qing frowned and said with a bit of displeasure. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Forget it.” Qin Yu waved his hand.

Qin Yu didn’t want to say anything to the people of the Su family.

“Qin Yu, why aren’t you serving my sister at home? Why did you come to South City?” Sun Ying said arrogantly.

“I have nothing to do with your sister.” Qin Yu glanced at her and said coldly.

Sun Ying suddenly understood and said, “Oh, I know. Were you kicked out by my sister again?”
