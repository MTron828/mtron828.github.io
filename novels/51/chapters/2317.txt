2318 The Arrival of the Monster Race

“Die.”

Qin Yu stepped above the air like a demon god, and a giant fire dragon swept from behind him.

Many demonic cultivators surrounding the altar were instantly burned to charcoal.

Several with strong demonic qi also failed to resist the intense flames after withstanding for a few seconds.

They were burned to ashes. However, Piao Ruoyun and the others were unharmed when the fire dragon swept past them.

Piao Ruoyun and the others were initially waiting for their deaths.

“Qin Yu!”

She cried out involuntarily, her voice carrying a sobbing tone.

She was a sixth-grade True Saint cultivator. People in this cultivation realm usually had a firm dao mind.

She did not expect to lose her composure like this. One could imagine the impact the demonic cultivator had on her.

Within the flames, the monster race old man held a bone staff.

Intense demonic qi continuously emitted from the bone staff, and it actually blocked the fire dragon’s attack!

“Boom!”

The dragon head and the bone staff clashed for a few seconds before exploding.

“Who are you?”

The old man was covered in blood. The embers of the fire dragon fell on him and burned a large part of his skin.

Seeing all the surrounding demonic cultivators fall, he let out an angry howl.

He waved his bone staff, and suddenly, a cold wind swept in.

Qin Yu instantly felt countless vengeful souls who had died tragically being summoned, crazily stabbing toward his sea of consciousness.

Then the old man chanted a long incantation toward the altar. A soul that the naked eye could not detect separated from his body and walked into the altar.

Qin Yu’s body moved, but he did not stop him.

He wanted to see what other tricks were up his sleeve.

After dozens of breaths, the soul in the middle of the altar stood up again and slowly walked back to the elderly man’s body.

He slowly opened his eyes, his silver-green pupils coldly staring at Qin Yu.

“Did you change your soul? Let me see what you have up your sleeves.”

Qin Yu shouted coldly.

“Hehe!”

The old man slowly stretched out his hand, and demonic qi surged continuously in his hand.

The demonic Qi was not much stronger than before, but the rules of the Path of Heaven in the air seemed to have changed.

The circulation of the chaotic qi in Qin Yu’s body was affected to a certain extent. This feeling was like being suppressed in the ninth level of purgatory.

He stretched out a claw, and a gigantic demon god appeared above Qin Yu’s head.

The giant claw in his hand slashed at Qin Yu. The instant the giant claw slashed past, it actually ignored Qin Yu’s defense.

It directly penetrated his soul and grabbed his divine sense.

That hand exerted force and wanted to pull Qin Yu’s soul out of the body.

“Is that all you have?”

Qin Yu sneered. The power of divine sense spiraled up like a vortex and grabbed the giant hand in the void.

The Soul Torment Mind Technique suddenly circulated, and the power of divine sense was suddenly absorbed by Qin Yu.

However, after the absorbed power of divine sense entered his sea of consciousness, he could not absorb it.

“Hmm?”

Qin Yu revealed a puzzled expression. This was the first time he had encountered such a situation. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Was the divine sense of the demonic cultivator different from that of the humans? He did not overthink it and directly suppressed the divine sense that he had absorbed.

The phantom in the sky became a little transparent in a few breaths.

The elderly man let out an angry howl as if his dignity had been provoked.

He behaved like a frenzied wild beast, relentlessly pounding his bone staff against the altar.

The figure in the void was half-knelt, and no longer tried to pull his arm out.

Instead, he stabbed his arm deep into Qin Yu’s Sea of Soul.

“Gulp, gulp, gulp!”

The phantom’s head slowly melted, turning into countless green water that rolled down.

In an instant, the giant completely melted and entered Qin Yu’s divine sense.

Qin Yu was in a dark continent, and a giant in the void stared at him expressionlessly.

Countless devout monster race cultivators followed his command and pounced on Qin Yu crazily biting him.

Some even directly self-destructed just to cause a trace of injury to Qin Yu.

“Petty tricks. Even if you were to come personally today, I would still kill you, a blood-stained thing!”

Qin Yu sneered and said. He waved his hand.

The power of the soul transformed into countless ropes that bound the giant in the void.

“Ding!”

The golden Soul Shattering Golden Radiance struck the giant like lightning, but it was caught between his two fingers.

Green flames were burning, and they burned the Soul Shattering Golden Radiance into golden water that dripped onto the ground.

“Hmph!”

Qin Yu’s sea-like divine sense entered the Soul Shattering Golden Radiance, and that golden radiance emitted a dazzling and hot light.

The boundless force directly broke the two fingers and cut the giant into pieces. It turned into a pool of green power of soul in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness directly suppressed him. The old man died when Qin Yu killed his soul.

…

In a dark galaxy, a gigantic figure suddenly stood up.

Anger filled his eyes as he stared at a specific direction in the sky and let out an angry howl.

…

“It’s alright now. Get up.”

Qin Yu burned off the ropes in the hands of Piao Ruoyun and the others.

“Qin Yu!”

Piao Ruoyun threw herself into Qin Yu’s arms and cried bitterly. Her body was trembling non-stop.

“It’s alright now.”

Qin Yu patted her head.

The other elders also fell into a deathly silence. It took them quite a while to recover.

“Thank you, my friend. I’ve never seen such a terrifying demonic cultivator in all my years of life.”

An elder said while trembling.

“They seem to be deliberately causing fear. Almost all the people were tortured before they were killed. Including the ordinary people, almost the entire Green Azure Ridge Continent had been wiped out.”

“Those lucky enough to survive are children or ordinary people who are powerless.”

Several people trembled as they interacted, being scared out of their wits.

“Have demonic cultivators ever come to purgatory before?” Qin Yu was puzzled.

“The last time demonic cultivator came to purgatory was two Path of Heaven years ago. Back then, the monster race was chased to a low-level star field. Logically speaking, they shouldn’t have come.

“I don’t know why, but this time, a spatial rift appeared on the Azure Ridge Continent, and the monster race suddenly came out to kill people everywhere.”

An elder of Azure Firmament Sect who had cultivated for the longest time, thought for a long time before he recalled.

“Are these star fields going to be interconnected?”

Qin Yu recalled the monster race he encountered when he picked the Paramita Flower. They seemed to have also come through the spatial rift.

For a moment, he was unsure if he was happy or sad.

Once the monster race descended, the ones who suffered the most would definitely be the people at the bottom.

What he saw just now explained everything.

“The monster race is tremendously ferocious. Even if they die, they will self-destruct. Moreover, their bloody methods make many people tremble in fear. They can’t be stopped in the end.”

Piao RuoYun said while sobbing.

Logically speaking, purgatory was not so peaceful. Almost everyone had seen blood.

But these methods paled in comparison to the monster race.

“I’ll bring you back to Solitary Cloud City. I’m afraid this place isn’t safe anymore. You bring all the people over.”
