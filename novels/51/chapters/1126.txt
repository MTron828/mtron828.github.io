Chapter 1127: Chapter 1,127, the Almighty’s compromise? ! 

The huge finger was rapidly pressing down!

As the distance between them got closer and closer, the finger also grew larger. It almost covered the sky and blocked out the rays of the sun!

“What a huge finger... could it be the end of the world... ?”

“That’s not a finger, it must be a missile! How could there be such a finger! ?”

“Is it a movie? The current technology is really awesome...”

Many ordinary people looked at the finger that was pressing down and were shocked. They were all discussing animatedly.

However, the many disciples of heaven gate had extremely uneasy expressions on their faces.

This finger looked too terrifying. That terrifying radiance almost blinded everyone’s eyes!

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold as he said, “Tian Zong, are you trying to destroy the entire Heaven Gate!”

“Or what?”Tian Zong placed his hands behind his back.

“A great battle can not avoid casualties. Don’t you understand this principle?”

Qin Yu’s expression could not help but turn cold. He raised his head and looked at the finger. He immediately rose up from the ground and clenched his fist to meet it.

“Boom!”

A fist smashed onto the finger, but it was like an egg hitting a rock. It did not stir up a single ripple.

All of Qin Yu’s strength disappeared the moment it touched the finger!

“It’s useless.”Tian Zong shook his head, seemingly very confident.

Qin Yu could not help but frown. If this finger fell, let alone the Heaven Gate, the entire city would suffer!

“We must not let this spell touch the ground,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

He closed his eyes slightly and muttered. Then, his body emitted a golden light and his body began to expand!

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu’s body expanded dozens of times!

That huge figure suddenly appeared on the ground of the Heaven Gate!

“Damn it, Ultraman! Look, there’s Ultraman!”

“F * ck you, there’s no Golden Ultraman.”

“It must be an illusion, an illusion!”

Many people raised their heads to look at Qin Yu’s huge figure, not realizing that danger was coming.

“Limitless Dharma Idol?”

Tian Zong immediately saw the spell that Qin Yu was casting.

All dharma idol spells were top-notch spells. Without a certain background, it was impossible to learn such spells.

“What’s the background of this kid?”Tian Zong could not help but frown.

Qin Yu, who had cast the limitless dharma idol, looked coldly at the finger.

The finger continued to press downwards. When it was a hundred meters away from the ground, there was already a reaction on the ground.

The mountain collapsed and the trees rose up from the ground. For a moment, sand and stones flew and the sky turned dark!

The Golden Light on Qin Yu’s body became stronger and stronger, and his internal Qi was unleashed to the maximum!

“Ha!”

Just as the finger arrived, Qin Yu suddenly roared angrily!

He crossed his arms and held the finger in his arms!

Golden light emitted from Qin Yu’s body. It was as dazzling as the sun.

Along with the Golden Light, a tremendous power erupted from between his arms!

“Ah! ! !”

Qin Yu let out a series of angry roars as he held the finger tightly. The terrifying power could be said to be able to destroy anything as easily as breaking a dead branch. It was as if he was going to crush the finger!

Tian Zong snorted lightly and said in a low voice, “A mantis trying to stop a chariot. You Don’t know whether you’re Dead or alive. A mere martial saint dares to fight against a mighty figure.”

However, before he could finish his sentence, he frowned.

Cracks appeared on the two walls of Qin Yu’s finger!

“Crack, crack, crack!”The sound of cracking could be heard continuously as if it had reached its limit!

“Eh?”Tian Zong frowned.

“How can this child have such strength? !”

Before he could be shocked, the cracks on the finger had already increased.

Light erupted from each of the cracks.

“Ah! !”

Qin Yu raised his head and let out an angry roar. His strength seemed to have been exerted to the limit!

Finally, the finger could no longer withstand it and directly exploded!

In an instant, the sky was covered by the light of the explosion. The dazzling light had blinded countless people for a short period of time!

Tian Zong’s expression was not too good.

He had thought that killing Qin Yu would be effortless.

However, he did not expect that the spell he had cast would be dissolved so easily.

After the finger was crushed, the sky returned to normal. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Qin Yu took off his huge body and stood in front of Tian Zong.

A trace of sweat appeared on his face. It was obvious that this move put a lot of pressure on Qin Yu.

“You have some ability,”Tian Zong said indifferently.

Qin Yu wiped away the sweat that was about to flow down. He grinned and said, “Tian Zong, is this your trump card? That really disappointed me...”

Tian Zong raised his brows and said indifferently, “Qin Yu, are you looking down on a mighty figure? Do you know that a mighty figure in this world is an existence that can destroy an entire country?”

“Oh?”Qin Yu could not help but sneer.

“A body that has been sealed for a thousand years and is close to being depleted of qi and blood dares to call itself a mighty figure? If you were in your peak state, I would naturally be afraid of you. But the current you... is only so-so.”

Tian Zong’s expression instantly became somewhat ugly.

Just as Qin Yu had said, the current him had just been born and his Qi and blood was indeed close to being exhausted. He was far from being at his peak. Otherwise, he would not have planted so many strange flowers on the Cloud Dragon Island.

“You are right. I am indeed not at my peak. However, I am still a mighty one. I am definitely not someone that a puny little martial saint like you can compare to,”Tian Zong said indifferently.

“The holy region is about to open. I don’t want to kill you. Why Don’t you hand over the remaining strange flowers and I will let you go?”

These words immediately shocked everyone!

This Tian Zong seemed to be threatening, but in reality, his tone was full of compromise!

“Is... is he admitting defeat?”Someone muttered in a low voice.

“Perhaps this Tian Zong wants to preserve his strength and head to the Holy Region.”

“But... but he is a mighty figure after all. To actually compromise with a martial saint... unbelievable, too unbelievable!”
