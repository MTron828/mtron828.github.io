Chapter 1411: Chapter 1411, first elder, who was vomiting blood

The voice came from somewhere. Soon, the sect master’s huge shadow appeared in the sky.

No one knew what kind of method it was, but it couldn’t help but give people a big shock.

Qin Yu raised his head and looked at the sect master’s Shadow. He couldn’t help but frown.

The first elder cupped his hands and said, “Yes, sect master.”

The sect master’s shadow did not say anything more. He slowly disappeared in the air.

Just as he was about to disappear, the sect master suddenly glanced at Qin Yu from the corner of his eyes.

His gaze was incomparably cold, causing people to feel a chill run down their spines.

The first elder just stood there with his body bowed, as if he was sending the sect master off.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes. He seized this opportunity and suddenly moved forward. With a bang, he smashed his fist towards the first elder.

The golden light blotted out the sky and covered the Sun. This punch seemed to be able to destroy everything, as if it wanted to devour the entire world.

The first elder felt the terrifying killing intent coming from behind him. His expression changed drastically, and he hurriedly responded, but it was already too late!

Boom

A loud sound spread out like thunder at this moment. The entire body of the first elder was submerged by this divine power.

His body was sent flying. He spat out blood continuously and half of his body was about to be shattered.

Under the unguarded punch, even if the great elder had great abilities, he was still severely injured.

The Great Elder glared at Qin Yu and said through gritted teeth, “Little Bastard, you don’t know martial virtue! How dare you Sneak Attack Me!”

Qin Yu remained silent and continued to shoot forward.

He knew that he might not be a match for the first elder, so he could only take advantage of his illness to take his life.

Another Golden Fist approached. The first elder did not care about his injuries and hurriedly hid in the void.

However, Qin Yu’s fist was too powerful. Even if the first elder hid in the void, he was still shaken and fell out.

After two consecutive punches, even though the first elder had unparalleled strength, he still appeared to be in an extremely sorry state.

His long hair was disheveled, and his entire body was covered in blood. He staggered as if he was going to fall to the ground at any moment.

More importantly, his aura had also become extremely dispirited. Based on the current situation, the first elder might really die here!

Qin Yu, who had recovered his physical body, was simply too terrifying! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Even if the first elder were to go all out, he might not even dare to take Qin Yu’s punch head-on, much less when it was a sneak attack!

“You Little Bastard... how dare you sneak attack me... Wah!”

It was not known whether it was because he was too heavily injured or because he was angry, but he opened his mouth and spat out large mouthfuls of blood.

“Old Thing, I will kill you today!”Qin Yu’s face was ice-cold, like a god of killing. The cold killing intent made everyone in the Heavenly Cloud Sect Shiver.

Qin Yu’s right fist bent, and golden light shone brightly. The fighting word formula was directly activated to the fifth level.

The intense killing intent made everyone feel uneasy.

“Grand Elder, let’s retreat quickly. There’s Always Hope!”Someone shouted in a hurry.

How could the Grand Elder accept this? However, his aura was indeed weakening rapidly.

Qin Yu’s two punches almost took half of his life!

On the other hand, Qin Yu was full of energy. The more he fought, the braver he became. If this continued, the grand elder might really die here!

“Little Bastard, remember this. If I don’t take revenge, I swear I won’t be a human!”The first elder gritted his teeth and turned to leave.

His body turned into balls of black light and shot into the distance.

Looking at the direction where the first elder had escaped, Qin Yu could not help but snort coldly.

“Old Thing, you ran quite fast.”Qin Yu snorted coldly.

He opened the desolate divine eye and looked in the direction where the first elder had left.

This old Deng ran extremely fast and in the blink of an eye, he had escaped from the range of the desolate divine eye.

It had to be said that the first elder was indeed good at escaping.

The Aura on Qin Yu’s body gradually dissipated.

He lowered his head and looked at the dark golden radiance on his body. There was an indescribable excitement in his heart.

“As expected, after my body recovers, my combat strength has increased by quite a bit,”Qin Yu said with a sigh.

Before his physical body recovered, Qin Yu had no ability to fight back in front of the first elder.

Although he had heavily injured the first elder with a sneak attack, this was enough to show how terrifying Qin Yu’s current strength was.

Qin Yu turned around and returned to the divine capital. This battle gave him some breathing room.

“I have to make a trip to Yang City as soon as possible,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He was looking forward to his performance after recovering his spiritual power.

On the other side, the great elder fled in a sorry state and stumbled back to the Heavenly Cloud sect.

Seeing the great elder’s attitude, the entire sect could not help but be shocked!

“Great Elder, what... What happened to you?”A disciple hurriedly walked forward, but was pushed away by the great elder.

He hurriedly returned to his own elder’s residence, wanting to find his precious medicinal herbs to recover from his injuries.

But the great elder rummaged through all the treasure vaults, but found that there was nothing in the treasure vaults!

“Where... Where are my things, where are my things!”The great elder asked somewhat anxiously.

The person next to him said in a trembling voice, “A few days ago, someone took your token and took all your things, and even received tens of millions of spirit coins in your name from the sect’s accounts...”
