Chapter 1440: Chapter 1,440, you can keep it for yourself

Zhuo Jing held the three Dragon Tiger pills in his hand and said with a smile, “It’s not to the extent of damaging one’s foundation, but any medicinal pill that can raise one’s cultivation level in a short period of time will have certain side effects, and the Dragon Tiger Pill is no exception.”

When the stall owner heard this, he shook his head and said, “That won’t do. That doesn’t mean anything to me.”

“How can it be meaningless? Who wouldn’t encounter a crisis in their life? Compared to the side effects, life is more important,”Zhuo Jing said with a faint smile.

This was true. Just as Zhuo Jing said, anyone would encounter a dilemma. The Dragon Tiger Pill could indeed save one’s life at a critical moment.

This was also the reason why this kind of pill was so popular, even if it had side effects.

The stall owner still shook his head and said, “Then I might as well find a few teleportation talismans. Isn’t that more effective?”

“I have a teleportation talisman too.”Zhuo Jing’s mind moved, and he actually took out a teleportation talisman from a spatial god tool.

Seeing the teleportation talisman in Zhuo Jing’s hand, the surrounding people couldn’t help but be shocked.

They looked at this young man in surprise, and for a moment, they seemed to be unable to figure out his origin.

“As expected of Zhuo Jianchen’s son. The treasure in his hand is indeed worthy of its reputation,”the stall owner said with a faint smile.

Zhuo Jing said indifferently, “Name your price. A few teleportation talismans can be exchanged for the life Qi in your hand.”

The stall owner still shook his head and said, “These things are all consumables. I’m not interested in consumables.”

“Young Master Zhuo, I’m quite interested in this teleportation talisman. I wonder if you’re willing to sell it?”The person next to him asked.

“I’m willing to trade the Vajra pill for it.”

“I have a thousand-year-old divine medicine in my hands. I’m also willing to help.”

Zhuo Jing shook his head slightly. He ignored the people around him and continued to stare at the stall owner.

“Then what do you want? Let’s cut to the chase,”Zhuo Jing said.

The stall owner narrowed his eyes and looked at the Silver Spring in Zhuo Jing’s hand.

“If I’m not wrong, the Silver Spring in your hand is the Silver Spring that your father took when he fought in the war, right?”The stall owner said.

Zhuo Jing lowered his head to look at the sword in his hand and nodded. “That’s right. This is the Silver Spring.”

“Then the Silver Spring in your hand is the exchange.”The stall owner said with a faint smile.

Zhuo Jing’s expression instantly became a little ugly.

This Silver Spring was a treasured sword left behind by his father. It was a personal item of a return to void tier cultivator. Its power was far from what ordinary return to void tier weapons could compare to.

“Using life Qi to exchange for the Silver Spring. You’re really asking for too much.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but say with a black face.

The stall owner spread his hands and said, “Anyway, these are my conditions. You can exchange it or not.”

Zhuo Jing said in a deep voice, “The Silver Spring is a treasure sword left behind by my father. Naturally, I can’t sell it. However, I can bring you to my house to visit. No matter what you like, I can give it to you. How about it?”

Zhuo Jing’s words made Qin Yu extremely moved.

He was really generous to exchange for Qin Yu’s life energy.

“That won’t do. Once I leave this exchange guild, who can guarantee my safety?”The stall owner shook his head slightly and said.

Zhuo jing smiled and said, “Don’t worry. I can swear with my spiritual sense that I will never touch you.”

“Just because you won’t kill me doesn’t mean that you won’t find others to kill me,”the stall owner said with a sneer.

“You don’t have to waste your breath on me. I don’t want anything other than the Silver Spring in your hands.”

Qin Yu, who was at the side, said with a dark face, “Then you’d better keep it for yourself. I Don’t need this thing anymore.”

After saying that, Qin Yu dragged Zhuo Jing and was about to leave.

At this time, the stall owner said indifferently, “Without the life energy, you can’t recover your spiritual power. You Don’t need it? Hehe, you’re just stubborn.”

Qin Yu stopped in his tracks.

He turned around and looked at the stall owner, sneering, “Indeed, I don’t need it anymore, because I’ve already recovered.”

After saying that, Qin Yu’s body suddenly shook, and a terrifying pressure immediately erupted!

His body turned into a golden color, extremely dazzling!

The surrounding people were directly pushed back by this aura, and some people couldn’t even withstand the pressure, and their bodies went limp.

Feeling the powerful aura on Qin Yu’s body, everyone was shocked!

“This Qin Yu has already recovered?”

“What a powerful aura! But he clearly looks like a nascent soul stage cultivator, what’s going on...”

Qin Yu’s extremely powerful aura shocked everyone!

The stall owner frowned even more. He knew that he had lost the ability to raise the price.

“So you should keep it for yourself,”Qin Yu sneered. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

After saying that, Qin Yu pulled Zhuo Jing and turned to leave.

“Wait.”

At this time, the stall owner spoke.

He said in a deep voice, “It’s not impossible for you to want the life qi. We can talk.”

“Talk my ass,”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse.

He really wanted to get the life energy in his heart, but on the surface, he still wanted to pull Zhuo Jing away.

“What do you want? Say It.”Zhuo Jing shook his head and stopped in his tracks.

The stall owner thought for a moment and said, “I want ten teleportation talismans and ten dragon tiger pills. How about it?”

“You Want Your Grandpa!”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse.

“Zhuo Jing, let’s Go!”

“Five. No less,”the stall owner said coldly.

“Deal.”Zhuo Jing agreed without thinking.
