Chapter 1248: Chapter 1,248, sanctum selection 

He opened the Martial Arts Forum as he ran out of the door.

As expected, the martial arts forum was already in an extremely heated state.

Many people were discussing the opening of the sanctum this time.

“Rumor has it that someone from the sanctum has descended again. This time, it’s not under anyone’s control!”

“That’s right, everything depends on talent.”

“Rumor has it that they can test the strength of their talent! As long as their talent is strong enough, they will have a chance to enter the Holy Region!”

Apart from these comments, there were also pictures sent from below.

In a certain mountain forest in the east continent, there were many people dressed in embroidered clothes testing the strength of the crowd.

The people who came to participate in the test formed a long line.

They looked more formal than Lu Guan. Lu Guan couldn’t compare with them in terms of their clothes and magic weapons.

This showed that the sects on Earth were much more powerful than Lu Guan’s.

“Finally.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

He put his phone away and hurried to the Heaven Gate.

All the way back to the Heaven Gate, Di Zun was still waiting for Qin Yu at the Heaven Gate.

Seeing Qin Yu coming back, Di Zun ran up quickly.

“Master, you are finally back. The people from the holy region are here. They are having a public selection test!”Di Zun said excitedly.

“Yes, sect master. We are all waiting for your news.”

“But this time, it seems to be very strict. As long as the talent is not enough, they will be mercilessly rejected.”

“Aiya, the sect master is the number one person in the world. Naturally, there’s no problem with him. I just don’t know what’s going on with us.”

A rare smile appeared on Qin Yu’s face.

He had waited for such a long time, but it was finally here.

The hard work really did not disappoint the diligent.

“How long have they been here?”Qin Yu asked.

“They just arrived yesterday,”Di Zun hurriedly said.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “There’s still time.”

As he said this, the few reclusive mighty figures also arrived at the Heaven Gate.

After a year, only these ten people were left among the twenty or so mighty realm experts. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

They quickly walked in front of Qin Yu. Someone knelt down and said with a pleading tone, “Qin Yu, please think of a way to bring us to the holy region. As long as we can go to the holy region, we are willing to do anything for you!”

Seeing their humble attitude, Qin Yu said with some surprise, “You guys... What’s going on? Get Up First.”

A mighty figure said with a sorrowful expression, “According to the information we received, their selection is extremely strict. Some of our people have already gone, but they rejected us.”

“Just as you guessed, we are already at the end of our rope. It’s impossible for us to enter their eyes...”

“Qin Yu, we have waited for so long just to go to the Saint Realm. Please think of a way for us!”

Qin Yu was also in a dilemma.

Such a matter wasn’t something that he could decide.

But looking at the kneeling crowd before him, Qin Yu didn’t know how to reject them.

“Let’s go first. We’ll think of a way after we go,”after hesitating for a long time, Qin Yu said.

These mighty figures looked at each other and said, “Qin Yu, you... you have to think of a way for us.”

“Of course, of course.”Qin Yu nodded repeatedly.

Then, Qin Yu swept his gaze over everyone and said, “Those who went to the Saint Realm first, pack up. We’re going to the East Continent Now.”

“Do we have a chance too?”

“That’s great! Thank you, Sect Master!”

The group of people cheered, their voices shaking the sky and Earth.

Qin Yu looked at Zhen Yue and said, “Let’s go together.”

Zhen Yue blushed slightly and said, “I. . . I Won’t go. With my strength, it’s a waste to go...”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Who knows about talent? What if you’re extremely talented?”

“That’s right. Besides, with my master’s talent, it’s okay to bring two more people, right?”Di Zun said with a smile.

Zhen Yue hesitated for a moment, then nodded and said, “Okay, I’ll listen to you.”

The group of people set off on the same day and headed toward the east continent.

There were a total of twenty-three people, which was not a small group.

On the way.

A mighty figure said, “According to the latest news we received, a young grandmaster has been selected.”

“Grandmaster?”

This surprised Qin Yu.

“En, rumor has it that this grandmaster is extremely talented. He’s only fourteen this year.”

“Fourteen... that’s really young.”

“Looks like the rumors aren’t false. As long as his talent is strong enough, he’ll be chosen by them.”

Qin Yu touched his chin and said, “Have they set a number?”

“I don’t think so.”An almighty shook his head.

“The sect that descended this time seems to be not weak. It’s very powerful and very rich. It’s much larger than last time.”

“En, so I hope sect Master Qin can help me.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “If there’s a chance, I will definitely plead for everyone.”

Qin Yu was not worried about his talent.

Not to mention Earth, even in the entire holy region, Qin Yu was definitely considered top-tier.

Heaven Gate was not close to the east continent. It took them more than a dozen times to reach the east continent.

In the mountains and forests of the East continent, the selection was in full swing.

Those who were selected danced with joy, while those who were eliminated sighed.

This time, there were a total of six people who descended from the Holy Region, four young people, and two old men.

The old man sat silently behind him. The four young men were in charge of the selection.

Their strength was far above Lu Guan’s.

These people had all stepped into the mighty realm. Although they were only in the early-stage, it was enough to show the strength of their sect.
