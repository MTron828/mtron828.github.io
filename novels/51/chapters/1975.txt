1976 I Will Leave When I Want To

Qin Yu looked around and found the people around him also quite dissatisfied. No one would be willing to be suspected for no reason and have their freedom restricted.

However, no one was willing to step forward because no one was willing to offend the nine great aristocratic families.

Even though fighting is not allowed in Sky City, there was a high chance they would be dealt with once they left the city. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Qin Yu snorted coldly in his heart when he saw the reluctant looks on their faces.

!!

After that, Qin Yu suddenly got up and said, “You have no right to restrict our freedom. As for how you want to investigate, that’s your business. Moreover, you’re responsible if things are lost. It’s none of our business.”

The scene fell silent, but Qin Yu could feel everyone looking at him with some admiration.

On the stage, the young man looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “I won’t take up much of your time.”

“It’s not about the time taken. You don’t have the right to even delay us for a second. I have the right to leave if I want to.” Qin Yu sneered.

Since he had already offended him, there was nothing to fear.

After saying this, Qin Yu stood up and left.

When he reached the door, the two elderly men suddenly blocked his way.

“Quickly get lost. Don’t waste my time,” Qin Yu said impatiently.

The young man on the stage sneered and said, “You’re in such a hurry to leave. Does this matter have anything to do with you?”

Qin Yu laughed and said, “So it has something to do with me just because I want to leave. Don’t worry. I won’t leave Sky City even if I leave. If you need anything, just come and look for me.”

Although he said that, the two elderly men showed no signs of moving away.

The door was blocked by them. Thus Qin Yu could not leave even if he wanted to.

“What do you mean? Must I stay?” Qin Yu turned around and looked at the young man.

“Yes, you must stay,” the young man nodded slightly and said.

“What if I insist on leaving?” Qin Yu’s body glowed with a golden light as if he was about to attack.

The young man did not panic. He said indifferently, “What? You want to make a move in Sky City, do you? As long as you make a move in Sky City, the royal family can take your life at any time. By the way, it’s not just the prince but also the nine great aristocratic families.”

“I don’t dare to do it,” Qin Yu said, waving his hand. “Moreover, I’m not as unruly as you.”

After saying this, Qin Yu swiftly moved to the side with his feet stepping the line word formula.

Then he clenched his golden fist and smashed it against the wall.

“Boom!”

With a loud bang, the wall instantly shattered!

Qin Yu strode out of the auction house and said with a smile, “Don’t worry. I’ll pay for the wall.”

The young man’s face darkened with his eyes full of murderous look.

“This d*mned Qin Yu…” the young man muttered, but he could not break the rules in Sky City.

After leaving Sky City, Qin Yu went home in a hurry.

Fortunately, no one caught up with him on his way back. Thus Qin Yu went back safely.

As soon as he entered the house, Qin Yu found Jue Wu sitting there eating. Seeing Qin Yu, Jue Wu got up and mumbled, “Where have you been? I thought you were killed…”

“Why did you come back?” Qin Yu asked in surprise.

Jue Wu said, waving her hand, “I don’t need to do anything now. Ever since that demon race mysterious person appeared, there’s no more opportunity for me.”

Qin Yu thought for a while and agreed with her.

“That’s good. Then we’ll stay here for the time being,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

After that, Qin Yu sat cross-legged and began to think about the whole thing.

“Two persons… There aren’t many people in the entire Holy Region capable of stealthily stealing the auction items,” Qin Yu frowned and said.

“Don’t tell me he’s the man with the mustache?” Qin Yu suddenly remembered somebody.

The man with the mustache would be one of them if there were people who really could do it.

Qin Yu had never seen his real ability, but the fact that he could steal things from the nine great aristocratic families back then had proven his ability.

“That’s not right. Why would the man with the mustache suddenly appear in Sky City? Unless there’s some kind of supreme treasure in Sky City…” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

However, after much thought, Qin Yu still felt something was wrong because the items to be auctioned were definitely not supreme treasures. After all, once they arrived at the auction house, they would be screened. During the process, the people would have already kept the most attractive treasures.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of a possibility!

“Could it be… that the auction house is embezzling something?” Qin Yu gasped!

But if the auction house embezzled the money, it could have been done quietly.

What was their purpose in doing so?

Qin Yu couldn’t figure it out. He kept scratching his head, afraid that he would be involved in this matter.

Soon, the news of the theft of the auction house spread.

Instantly, the entire Sky City was discussing this matter. The news spreading was certainly about the mysterious person of the demon race and an accomplice that had stolen the treasure.

Although Qin Yu had some doubts, he did not think too much about it. After all, the auction house did not come after him.

“Jue Wu, let’s go. I’ll bring you around.” Qin Yu looked at Jue Wu and said with a smile.

Jue Wu immediately jumped up and said with a smile, “Let’s go. D*mn it. I’m going to suffocate to death at home.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He left home with Jue Wu and prepared to go to the gambling house in Sky City.

Jue Wu had shown her super good luck the last time he gambled on stones. Maybe there was some connection between the Nirvana Body and the treasures.

The two walked on the street and went straight to the gambling house.

However, before they reached the gambling house, they bumped into the Prince of Great Xia.

“Mr. Qin?” The prince was somewhat surprised to see Qin Yu.

Qin Yu bowed slightly and greeted the prince.

“I heard that you were also at the auction held not long ago?” the prince asked with a smile.

Qin Yu’s face slightly changed, and he quickly said, “Your Highness, that matter has nothing to do with me.”

“Of course, I know.” The prince smiled and looked at the teahouse beside them. “If Mr. Qin is available, why don’t we sit down and chat?”

Qin Yu couldn’t decline, so he nodded and said, “Alright.”

Therefore, Qin Yu had to change his plan for the time being and entered the teahouse with the Prince of Great Xia.

The prince found a very quiet room. After sitting down, the prince asked directly, “Mr. Qin, what exactly happened during the auction?”

Qin Yu didn’t hide anything and immediately told the prince what had happened.

Hearing what he said, the prince did not speak for a long while. After a long time, he muttered, “Mr. Qin, what’s your view on this matter?”

“This… I’m afraid my view doesn’t help, right?” Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

“We’re just having a chat, ” the prince said, waving his hand. “It’s fine to tell me.”
