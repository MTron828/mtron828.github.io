That palm brought with it a rolling pressure as it headed straight for Qin Yu!

Qin Yu stood there without moving an inch. His face was expressionless!

“Gotcha!” Seeing this, the First Elder was ecstatic!

This strike was his ultimate skill. Even a steel plate could be instantly smashed through!

“Clang!”

However, the next second, the First Elder’s expression froze on his face.

Qin Yu wasn’t affected by his palm strike! Even his skin wasn’t scratched!

“Is this the power of a half-step Martial Marquis?” Qin Yu looked down at the First Elder and sneered.

The First Elder’s expression suddenly changed drastically! A layer of sweat quickly formed on his forehead!

“This... how is this possible?” The First Elder, unable to believe the scene in front of him, took two steps back in horror!

His all-out attack had failed to injure him in the slightest?! Was he still a half-step Martial Marquis?!

“If I had really stepped into the half-step Martial Marquis Realm, you would be suppressed with just a raise of my hand.” Qin Yu laughed coldly.

He walked towards the First Elder step by step, while the First Elder unconsciously took a step back.

“You betrayed the Divine Alchemist Pavilion and attacked the Pavilion Master. You deserve to be punished for this crime,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“But I have always been soft-hearted. I will spare your life.”

After saying that, Qin Yu opened his mouth and revealed a brilliant smile.

“Don’t... Don’t kill me...” the First Elder was so scared that he was trembling.

At this moment, he had already lost the will to resist. He only wanted to save his life!

“Bang!”

A golden light lit up on his finger. Then, he lightly poked forward. A few crisp sounds were transmitted into his ears!

“Ah!!”

The First Elder’s limbs were instantly shattered, and he knelt on the ground with a plop!

Then, Qin Yu suddenly raised his foot and fiercely kicked the First Elder’s lower abdomen.

His dantian instantly exploded, and all of his inner strength quickly dissipated at this moment!

“You... you actually crippled me!” The First Elder roared in pain.

he had practically spent all of his effort to cultivate to the half-step Martial Marquis realm, and now, he was actually crippled on the spot!

“This is only the beginning.” Qin Yu sneered.

He slashed his hand toward the First Elder.

“Swish!”

Dozens of lights passed through the First Elder’s body. Countless wounds quickly turned him into a bloody man! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Each wound avoided his vital points. Not only would it bring endless pain, but it could also save his life.

“Buzz!”

Another ray of golden light lit up. Qin Yu raised his finger and pointed at the spot between the First Elder’s brows.

In an instant, the First Elder’s brain felt as if it had been struck by lightning!

The First Elder, who was about to faint, suddenly woke up from the pain!

His divine sense felt as if it was being gnawed on by a worm. This kind of pain made people wish they were dead!

Traces of blood flowed out from the First Elder’s wound. In a moment, Qin Yu was dyed red.

And the First Elder was kneeling in a pool of blood. It was too horrible to look at.

His pain was still ongoing. The immense pain made him foam at the mouth and twitch all over.

“Don’t worry. When the Pavilion Master returns, she will personally execute you,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Then, Qin Yu turned to look at the two attendants at the side.

The attendants had long been scared out of their wits and were hiding in a corner while shivering.

Qin Yu glanced at the attendants and said, “Remember to clean the Pavilion Master’s building every day. I don’t want the Pavilion Master to come back and see a mess.”

The attendant hurriedly nodded and said, “Yes... Elder... Elder Qin...”

The next day, the pharmacists had just woken up when they saw the First Elder kneeling in the middle of the square.

He was covered in blood and his face was distorted. The double torture of his body and spirit had made him utterly miserable.

“Huh? Isn’t this the First Elder?”

“Haha, which hero did this?”

“Bah! Dog, you deserve it! You should kneel here!”

The group of alchemists became more and more agitated as they spoke. They all rushed forward, then punched and kicked the First Elder.

At this moment, Qin Yu walked over from not far away.

“Elder Qin is here!”

Seeing Qin Yu, everyone hurriedly surrounded him.

They all surrounded Qin Yu and said anxiously, “Elder Qin, you must go and save the Pavilion Master!”

“Yes, the Pavilion Master would rather be severely injured than hand you over!”

“You must stand up for the Divine Alchemist Pavilion!”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said coldly, “I will go to the Saint Confucian Sect now. No matter what, I will bring the Pavilion Master back safe and sound.”

“We will go with you!” Everyone shouted.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “The Fifth Elder is right. The Divine Alchemist Pavilion is the painstaking brainchild of the Pavilion Master. We must not disperse.”

“If you guys really want to help, then protect the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

Everyone looked at each other and then nodded. “Elder Qin, please rest assured!”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He turned his head and walked out of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

...

In Jingdu, Yan Sihai, Xia Hang, and the others were gathered together.

They brought the Pavilion Master to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association and temporarily locked her up. However, they didn’t do anything.

The reason was, they wanted to see how the higher-ups would react.

After all, the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion had a lot of connections. They had to test the waters step by step.

“The higher-ups haven’t reacted yet. It seems that the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion isn’t that important,” Yan Sihai said coldly.

Xia Hang waved his hand and said, “Let’s wait a little longer. If the higher-ups really blame us, we won’t be able to handle it.”

Yan Sihai snorted and said, “What are you waiting for?! This woman has humiliated me many times and doesn’t take me seriously at all. If I don’t teach her a lesson, wouldn’t be prestige suffer?”

“Just do as I say and kill her immediately!”

Everyone looked at each other and was seemingly at a loss.

At this moment, a member of the Martial Arts Association suddenly rushed in from outside.

“Vice President Xia, someone is here...” the member said in surprise.

“If someone is here, so be it. Why are you so flustered?” Xia Hang said with some displeasure.

The member swallowed hard and said in a low voice, “The person who came... is a big shot...”

“Who is it?” Yan Sihai asked impatiently.

“Me!”

A voice came from outside the door.

They saw a man in a tunic suit.

Seeing this man, everyone in the room hurriedly stood up.
