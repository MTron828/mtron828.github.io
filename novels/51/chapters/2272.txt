2273 The Person of Nine Lifetimes

Numerous factors indicated that the two were related. Only by going down and exploring personally could this problem be solved. While it was dangerous, it also meant opportunities. This was also the reason why many cultivators wanted to go down.

“Man with the mustache, this place might not be safe either. I can sense that more than half of the spiritual energy of the dead cultivators has been injected into this red-haired evil spirit. If this continues, the formation might not be able to remain hidden. You think about it carefully.”

Qin Yu said seriously. The man with the mustache indeed had many secrets.

However, he had never tricked Qin Yu before. Deed down, he had long regarded the man with the mustache as a friend.

“Haha, you’re quite a nice person! It was not in vain for me to give my utmost sincerity to you.”

The man with the mustache chuckled.

Qin Yu rolled his eyes. Only the man with the mustache could maintain a frivolous look at this hour.

“I still believe in my judgment. If you die, I will burn you some paper money here. Of course, if you come out alive and obtain something, remember to give me half the treasures.”

The man with the mustache laughed heartily.

A dark green light suddenly appeared, and a broken bronze horn appeared in Qin Yu’s hand.

Dark green moss covered the horn, and several human carvings were inside.

“Use ghostly qi to refine this treasure.”

The man with the mustache’s voice sounded.

Qin Yu circulated the Soul Torment Mind Technique. After he injected the ghost qi into the horn, a muffled sound suddenly sounded.

Although the sound was not loud, it sounded like it was echoing in his divine sense at the same time.

The red-haired evil spirit suddenly stopped struggling and stood still within the runes.

The next moment, he let out a shrill scream and revealed an enormous blood-red mouth.

The densely packed saw-like teeth made the surrounding cultivators’ hearts beat rapidly and their bodies tremble. Suddenly, the muscles on his hands expanded, and the blood-red sickle cut the runes into pieces and pounced toward Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s legs became weak. At this moment, he could no longer deal with the red-haired evil spirit.

“Big Brother, no, Master, please don’t trick me with your thing.”

A ball of ghostly qi suddenly wrapped around Qin Yu, bringing him into the air and crashing into the formation.

This passageway was about one meter and 50 or 60 centimeters high, and passing through it meant one would have to bend one’s body.

There were several deep traces of attacks on the passageway.

It was likely that the few people who had come down first had attacked it, but they could not destroy it.

Qin Yu immediately bent down and slowly moved forward. This Ghost Mansion had existed for a much longer time than him. So what was the problem if he bent down?

The entire passageway seemed to be endless. Qin Yu ignited his purple fire and illuminated one side of it.

Even though he could roughly touch the wall’s outline, Qin Yu still gasped the moment it lit up.

These seemed to be murals from ancient times. There were countless scenes of war carved on them, and there were some differences between the appearance of those cultivators and the humans today.

There was only one main character in these murals. That was the masked woman!

It was indeed the Mystic Realm left behind by the masked woman. Qin Yu was tremendously shocked. Could Xiaoyu be here?

Qin Yu slowly walked forward. These murals seemed to be depicting the masked woman’s nine lifetimes.

There were countless seas of blood and corpses. Even though it was through the murals, Qin Yu seemed to sense the brutal ancient battle of that distant era.

Qin Yu was a little confused. The battle that the masked woman chose was completely random. She seemed to be a never-ending killing machine, constantly fighting until she died.

However, the murals recorded a terrifying point. Before each masked woman’s death, she would prearrange a burial mound, preparing for the next life’s reincarnation.

In the murals, the masked woman was facing an indescribably giant monster. The monster’s eyes were as big as mountains, and the masked woman was like an ant in front of the monster. Under such a vast gap, the masked woman died.

In every life, the masked woman died at the hands of this monster, but she persisted in challenging it.

This was the ninth life. Eleven people were carved on the passageway.

The murals showed this was the place.

“Eleven people?”

Qin Yu suddenly felt a chill run down his spine.

The token obtained by the Blood Sect’s sect master, Gu Ming, could bring ten people here, and the man with the mustache’s incomplete magical artifact had also sent him here. Did that mean the eleven of them had been predicted to be here?

A strong sense of unease enveloped Qin Yu’s heart. This feeling of being predicted was really not good. It was as if they had long been chess pieces in someone else’s hands.

At the end of the passageway, there was a painting of a boundless universe. On the ground of the boundless universe, there were countless corpses. Not a single person survived.

“Is this a prophecy or scenario the masked woman truly predicted? It signifies that the world is about to descend into chaos if it’s real.”

Qin Yu forcefully suppressed the uneasiness in his heart and continued walking forward. There was no other way out here.

In front of him, a terrifying fluctuation suddenly spread.

Qin Yu quickened his pace and passed through the passageway.

After passing through the passageway, he was greeted by incomparably vast space.

In the brilliantly gleaming expanse of gold, a luxuriously extravagant coffin lay right in the center.

“Qin Yu, how did you get here?”

When Zong Yue saw Qin Yu, his face revealed an incredibly shocked expression.

The others were also surprised, but they were focused on the coffin and did not ask much.

“D*mn it. I’m asking you a question. Did you hear me?”

When Zong Yue saw that Qin Yu had no intention of paying attention to him, he instantly flew into a rage.

“Shut up. If you keep nagging, I’ll kill you.”

Qin Yu glanced at him coldly.

“A person of nine lifetimes. Each time you reincarnated, you caused the entire world of cultivators to flow with blood. The Path of Heaven of the nine lifetimes had your figure in slaughter. Today, I must kill you, evil ghost!”

The evil exterminator said coldly to the coffin.

As if in response to the evil exterminator, countless energy gathered into the coffin from all directions.

A formless, massive amount of energy gradually formed, and a terrifying pressure enveloped everyone’s heads.

“What terrifying energy! It’s the energy obtained from slaughtering half of the purgatory! Can we handle it?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Gu Ming asked worriedly. The massive energy vibration seemed to have reached its peak.
