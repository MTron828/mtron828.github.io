Chapter 717: The Secret of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“In other words, Granny Qin is in control of a very powerful force?” Qin Yu said.

Xia Hang nodded and said, “Yes, her status is much higher than Qu Xie’s.”

This immediately put Qin Yu in a dilemma.

He originally planned to let Xia Hang find an opportunity to evacuate the purple-robed men of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association in the future.

Or rather, he would directly ask Xia Hang to let the purple-robed men betray the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

But now, it seemed that this was almost impossible.

“Xia Hang, what do you think is the most powerful force of Jingdu Martial Arts Association?” Qin Yu asked in puzzlement.

Xia Hang said in a deep voice, “On the surface, the most powerful force is the purple-robed men.”

Qin Yu nodded silently and said, “What exactly do you think the strength of those higher-ups is?”

“This... I don’t know either,” Xia Hang said.

“But I’ve never seen their real faces even though I’ve been in the job for so long.”

“Not only me, but even Qu Xie has never seen them.”

Qin Yu touched his chin and said in a low voice, “Is it possible that these eight higher-ups can’t show their faces at all?”

“For example... they are restricted in a certain Mystic Realm?”

Xia Hang’s mouth opened wide when he heard Qin Yu’s words.

This thought was a bit crazy.

Eight executives controlled the Jingdu Martial Arts Association by relying on their shadows?

“Otherwise, why are these eight executives so eager to expand their power?” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“Also... Qu Xie said last time that they sealed all the resources and controlled them. What are the biggest benefits of doing this?” Qin Yu looked at Xia Hang.

Xia Hang thought for a moment and suddenly said, “In order to prevent outsiders from cultivating too quickly! In case they threaten the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”

“Yes.” Qin Yu nodded.

This idea was also what Qin Yu had just guessed.

Before the Mystic Realm was exposed, Qin Yu had never thought of it this way.

However, this Mystic Realm was not only hidden from the various aristocratic families, even the higher-ups had been deceived by them.

Wasn’t its purpose to prevent anyone from threatening them?

Other than that, people like Qin Yu who could threaten them, they would immediately kill them!

And Yan Ruoxue’s bloodline would also be unable to escape their claws.

From the looks of it, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association seemed to be deliberately suppressing the strength of martial artists.

“These higher-ups have existed for many years. Their cultivation level is very likely at the Martial Saint Realm,” Qin Yu said.

“If they were Martial Saints, there’s no need to be afraid of anyone.”

“But even now, they haven’t shown up. Therefore... they are most likely just a shadow.”

Speaking up to this point, Qin Yu looked at Xia Hang and said in a deep voice, “Xia Hang, I will think of a way to let you go one step further and try to get in touch with those eight higher-ups.”

Xia Hang said nervously, “What do you want to do?”

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “No need to ask.”

“Oh right, when will the first Mystic Realm open?” Qin Yu asked.

Xia Hang said, “I don’t know yet. I need to have a meeting to discuss it.”

“Okay.” Qin Yu agreed.

“Remember to tell me when you have news.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and walked out of the office.

As soon as he walked out of the door, Qin Yu bumped into Kong Yun.

Kong Yun was brimming with anger, and his eyes were widened.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “What? You still want to fight with me? Then go and queue up.”

Kong Yun was silent for a moment, then he snorted and said, “Count it as I owe you a favor.”

After saying this, Kong Yun turned around and left.

Qin Yu was confused.

Owe him a favor? What did this mean?

“Inexplicable,” Qin Yu muttered.

...

In this academy, there was a dormitory.

After Qin Yu returned to his residence, Chang Mang quickly walked up to him.

“That b*stard Xia Hang didn’t do anything to you, right?” Chang Mang asked.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No.”

Chang Mang grunted, and then he said in a low voice, “You have to be careful. I heard from them that that black-haired kid won’t let you off.”

This indeed gave Qin Yu a bit of a headache.

Xiao Hei was a peak-stage Martial Marquis, and his strength was far above Qin Yu’s.

In a fight, Qin Yu really wasn’t a match for him.

“I have to find a time to break through as soon as possible,” Qin Yu thought inside.

He originally planned to wait until he entered the Mystic Realm to obtain the treasure, then strive to step into the late-stage Martial Marquis in one go.

At that time, there was no need to be afraid of Xiao Hei.

But now it seemed that it was a bit too late.

“Forget it, let’s take it one step at a time.” Qin Yu sighed slightly.

He got up and left the dormitory building. He came to the square of the academy once again.

“There are few people now. Maybe I can try to find the location of the Mystic Realm,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He released his spiritual sense and tried to find the connection with the Mystic Realm.

This was a meticulous job. Qin Yu didn’t dare to be distracted at all. He tried hard to find this trace of connection.

However, at this moment, Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes.

He frowned and said in a low voice, “Could it be that my senses are wrong?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Thinking of this, Qin Yu closed his eyes again. His powerful spiritual sense spread out in all directions.

Very soon, Qin Yu caught sight of that figure again.

“It really is him!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse inside.

He didn’t find the Mystic Realm, but he did find an acquaintance: the man with the mustache!

This b*stard actually came!

Qin Yu cursed inside. He followed his spiritual sense and ran in the direction of the man with the mustache.

At this moment, the man with the mustache was sitting by the roadside and talking with confidence.

“There is no place in this world that I don’t dare to go! I can go anywhere, from heaven to hell!”

Just as the man with the mustache was bragging, Qin Yu patted his shoulder with a dark expression.

“When did you come?” Qin Yu asked with a dark expression.

Hearing Qin Yu’s voice, the man with the mustache hurriedly jumped up from the ground.

Then, he took off and said as he walked, “Who are you? I don’t know you. Don’t come over!”

As he spoke, the man with the mustache had already fled hundreds of meters away while Qin Yu was chasing after him relentlessly.

The man with the mustache only heaved a sigh of relief when he arrived at an empty place.

“What’s wrong with you?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse.

The man with the mustache patted his own chest and said, “Qin Yu, don’t think that I don’t know that everyone in this academy wants to kill you. Whoever gets close to you will suffer! Don’t drag me into this.”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “Don’t worry. The person they are looking for is me. It won’t involve you.”

The man with the mustache mumbled, “Who knows? It would be bad if I’m injured by accident, especially the Heaven Swallowing Python. It’s a peak-level demon beast at the peak of the Martial Marquis realm. Who would dare to provoke it...”

“You know about the Heaven Swallowing Python?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

The man with the mustache said, “Of course! Let me tell you, among demon beasts, the Heaven Swallowing Python is equivalent to a human chaotic body. They are all invincible among the same level. Do you understand?”

“The Heaven Swallowing Python is invincible among demon beasts of the same level, let alone humans.”
