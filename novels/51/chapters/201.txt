“Hahahaha!” Feng Xiang couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“Qin Yu, who would believe in your words?” Feng Xiang raised his eyebrows and said.

Qin Yu was instantly enraged, and his entire body was filled with murderous aura!

Even after feeling this murderous aura, Feng Xiang didn’t seem to be afraid.

He sneered and said, “You want to kill me? Do you dare to?”

Qin Yu almost lost his composure, but Yan Ruoxue’s figure kept appearing in his mind.

“No, I can’t be destroyed like this.” Qin Yu gritted his teeth.

He closed his eyes and began to breathe slowly to adjust his state of mind.

Feng Xiang sneered. “Stay here obediently.”

The car sped all the way and soon arrived at the provincial capital.

However, what surprised Qin Yu was that he wasn’t brought to the police station. Instead, he was transferred to a relatively remote place.

There was a huge cage with a few big words written on it: Martial Arts Association’s Prisoner Detention Center.

Qin Yu looked up at the plaque and couldn’t help but frown. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

What was this place? Why had he never heard of it?

“Come down.” Feng Xiang waved his hand to indicate for Qin Yu to get out of the car.

Qin Yu got out of the car and followed Feng Xiang to the door.

Not long after, a person came out from inside.

Qin Yu took a closer look. This person was actually an Inner Strength Past Master!

“President Yuan, I’ll leave the person to you.” Feng Xiang said with a nonchalant smile.

The man called President Yuan nodded slightly and said, “Don’t worry, I’ll definitely deal with it seriously.”

Then, Feng Xiang turned to look at Qin Yu.

He smiled nonchalantly and said, “This is the place that deals with martial artists like you, and I am the vice president here.”

This was the first time Qin Yu found out about the Martial Arts Association and their responsibilities.

But... this place didn’t seem to belong to the government at all.

“Don’t think about escaping. Otherwise, you will be treated as a fugitive.” Feng Xiang once again saw through Qin Yu’s thoughts.

Qin Yu’s expression was slightly ugly. He glanced at Feng Xiang coldly with his eyes filled with killing intent.

“Feng Xiang, it won’t end well for you.” Qin Yu coldly said.

“Are you threatening me?” Feng Xiang laughed loudly.

“I advise you to think of a way to leave this place first.” Feng Xiang sneered.

Following which, Mr. Yuan waved his hand, and two more Inner Strength Past Masters walked out.

They grabbed Qin Yu’s arm and walked towards the prison.

“Go in!” After walking to a cage, the two of them pushed Qin Yu in roughly.

The cage was slowly closed, and the surroundings fell into darkness.

Qin Yu stretched out his palm, and a wisp of spiritual fire fell into his palm.

Borrowing the light of the spiritual fire, Qin Yu looked around.

The environment here was extremely bad. Not only was there no light, but there wasn’t even a place to sleep.

Qin Yu tried to sense the internal qi around him, but he found that the internal qi here seemed to be blocked.

“I won’t die here, will I?” Qin Yu frowned.

He never thought that Jiang Gu would use such a despicable method!

...

In the Jiang family’s home.

“Master, Qin Yu has been taken into custody. Yuan Hong is preparing the relevant materials. As long as the materials are ready, Qin Yu will die without a doubt,” Mr. Zhong reported.

Jiang Gu sat up with difficulty and said with a cold expression, “Spread the news! I want everyone in Chuzhou to know that no one here can go against the Jiangs!”

“Yes!” Mr. Zhong quickly agreed.

The next day, this news quickly spread throughout Jiangcheng.

This time, everyone’s attitude toward Jiang Gu was both hatred and fear.

“Jiang Gu is really shameless. He used such despicable methods when he wasn’t capable enough!”

“Using his connections to suppress Qin Yu is really disgusting!”

“Sigh, there’s nothing we can do. The Jiang family is too well-connected in Chuzhou. What good will it be if we provoke them?”

Everyone discussed animatedly. This time, they began to pity Qin Yu.

After all, for so many years, the only person in Chuzhou who dared to provoke the Jiang family and succeed was Qin Yu alone.

...

At this moment, Mr. Wu also received the news.

“Dad, you must think of a way to save Qin Yu!” Xiao Yu shook Mr. Wu’s arm, and there was anxiety in her tone.

Mr. Wu’s expression was also extremely unsightly. He smoked one cigarette after another.

“I really didn’t expect that Jiang Gu would use such a method to suppress Qin Yu,” Mr. Wu said in a sullen voice.

But for Mr. Wu, this matter was also quite a headache.

As the top dog in Chuzhou, Jiang Gu had an extremely close relationship with the Martial Arts Association.

In the early years, there were even rumors that the Martial Arts Association was the Jiang family’s back garden.

Even if Mr. Wu went to ask for him, the Martial Arts Association probably wouldn’t give in!

“Dad, say something!” Xiao Yu said anxiously.

Mr. Wu was silent for a moment, then he stood up and said, “I’ll go and talk to Jiang Gu. There might still be a chance.”

Thinking of this, Mr. Wu quickly got up and personally drove to the Jiang family.

In the Jiang family’s home, Mr. Wu sat in front of Jiang Gu’s bed and said politely, “Mr. Jiang, how is your body?”

Jiang Gu smiled nonchalantly and said, “I’ve almost recovered. I believe that I’ll be able to recover to my peak condition in no time.”

These words were actually a warning.

Mr. Wu could naturally discern it and couldn’t help but feel a little embarrassed.

“Chief Wu, if you have something to say to me, just say it,” Jiang Gu said nonchalantly.

Seeing this, Mr. Wu didn’t bother to be polite anymore.

He went straight to the point and said, “Mr. Jiang, I’m here about Qin Yu. If I still have some authority, I hope you can let Qin Yu go.”

When he heard this, Jiang Gu couldn’t help but laugh.

“Authority?” Jiang Gu raised his eyebrows.

“Mr. Wu, as far as I know, you seem to have retired, right?” Jiang Gu said with a nonchalant smile.

Mr. Wu frowned slightly and said in a sullen voice, “What do you mean?”

“What do I mean?” Jiang Gu sneered repeatedly.

“Mr. Wu, let me tell you, if it were in the past, I would still be afraid of you! Now that you have retired, you have no real power!”

“Show you respect? What do you think you are?” Jiang Gu shouted loudly!

When he heard Jiang Gu’s words, Mr. Wu’s expression instantly became extremely ugly!

He had guessed that Jiang Gu would refuse, but he didn’t expect him to be so impolite!

“Jiang Gu, do you think that you have the final say in Chuzhou?!” Mr. Wu glared at Jiang Gu and said.

Jiang Gu snorted coldly and said, “At least you don’t have the final say.”

“Also, let me tell you, not only do I want to lock Qin Yu in, but I also want him to die in there!”

“So what if you have great abilities in Chuzhou? As long as I give the word, even a genius will die prematurely!”

Mr. Wu was so angry that his face flushed. He pointed at Jiang Gu and said, “Jiang Gu, I will never let you off the hook!”

“Hahaha! You can go to the Martial Arts Association personally to ask for him. See if they will give in,” Jiang Gu said sarcastically.

Mr. Wu gritted his teeth and didn’t say anything more. He turned around and left the Jiang family’s home.
