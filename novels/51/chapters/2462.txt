Chapter 2463 Acupoints Open Again

Black saber!

Evil Eye moved slightly, and the space where the Moon Demon Godly King was in collapsed.

However, its body was unharmed and slowly disappeared from its original spot. It was the afterimage that was hit.

Night Parade.

A voice as dry as metal said softly.

Qin Yu’s pupils turned solemn. As the afterimage disappeared, he could no longer sense the Moon Demon Godly King’s internal qi.

The tracking technique of the sorcerer tribe was indeed heaven-defying. As long as a trace of the sorcerer tribe’s power was attached, there was no way to escape.

Previously, when Qin Yu went to Peach Blossom Island and returned to Sky City, his every move was monitored by the Ji family, but he was unaware.

At this moment, the Moon Demon Godly King had broken free from the lock of the sorcerer tribe’s power, and Qin Yu could not help but feel shocked.

All of a sudden, the power of the sorcerer tribe in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness started to surge violently.

In an instant, his entire body turned cold as if falling into an ice cave.

A ruthless consciousness had already locked onto him.

Deep darkness turned into a destructive arrow piercing through the warrior’s shield!

The pitch-black arrowhead flashed and leaped out from another space.

Everything was destroyed!

Nearly 30 drops of monster elemental energy in Qin Yu’s body suddenly surged and instantly rushed into his dantian.

An earth-shattering power exploded in his dantian. Previously, the monster elemental energy was combined drop by drop with the chaotic qi. This time, he used nearly 30 drops in one go. One could imagine how terrifying the energy erupted was.

A destructive internal qi exploded from every cell in Qin Yu’s body as he let out a heaven-shaking roar.

The two palms slammed together, and he caught the arrow.

“Boom!”

An invincible massive force transmitted from his palms, and the qi energy sent the mountains on both sides flying.

Qin Yu’s body flew out backward like a bolt of lightning, and it was so massive that it crashed through the crystal wall of the Solitary Shadow Continent directly.

It then entered the Fire Unicorn Continent. This terrifying power even pierced through the crystal wall of the continent.

“Boom!”

Qin Yu’s body was sent flying for an unknown period before it finally smashed into the hard and dark iron ore mountain, stopping the violent impact.

However, the arrow between the two palms still emitted a hum of unwillingness. After a long time, it finally returned to calm.

Qin Yu slowly released his palms. At this moment, his palms had become a bloody mess.

Qin Yu forcefully suppressed the vital energy in his body, and his body instantly appeared on the Solitary Shadow Continent.

However, this place was empty and had no trace of a living being.

He took a deep breath and spat a mouthful of blood. The violent vital energy finally calmed down a little.

Qin Yu’s expression was somewhat ugly. With such a monster race Godly King, he probably could not sleep peacefully.

“Ruoxue, control this Sumeru ring.”

Qin Yu entered the Sumeru World and slowly calmed down the violent vital energy surging in his body crazily. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The combination of 30 drops of monster elemental energy and chaotic qi directly reached the power of Tribulation Fourth Level.

If it wasn’t for the fact that he had opened acupoints in his body and absorbed a vast amount of energy…

And coupled with the tremendous progress in the Way of Space, countless small spaces had evolved in his body, containing a vast amount of violent energy.

However, this massive energy was still rampaging in his body. He suddenly rushed it into his acupoints again.

Yintang acupoint!

Vitality gate!

Yongquan acupoint!

In an instant, a terrifying impact forced a vast amount of vital energy into the three major acupoints.

When this power reached its limit, an acupoint on his right foot formed again.

“Right foot Yongquan acupoint, open!”

That terrifying energy instantly surged into the enormous Yongquan acupoint, and the vital energy in his body finally calmed down.

However, in the instant of life and death just now, he did not know how terrifying the explosive power of the arrow was. He could only use his full strength to receive the arrow.

After about two hours, he slowly calmed this energy down.

“What a powerful Godly King! With this kind of invisibility and extreme attack power, he’s destined to be a king in assassination. Even those in the realm of the Tribulation Fourth Level would probably have a headache against this kind of monster race.”

Lei Xin said with some lingering fear. If Yan Ruoxue had not reacted fast enough, that arrow would have killed him straight away.

At this moment, Chang Mang and Jue Wu were no longer laughing and joking. The appearance of this Godly King had indeed frightened them.

Previously, when they faced the army, they could still resist although it was hard to deal with.

But against the Moon Demon Godly King, he simply could not find a point to exert his strength.

“However, it seems merely to want to stop us from chasing after Cang Ming. It doesn’t have any other thoughts of fighting to the death.”

Qin Yu said with a frown. The Moon Demon Godly King had only shot two arrows, so he probably had not used all his trump cards yet. The reason why he fled in such a hurry was probably because he did not want to be entangled in the battle.

“We can’t rule out the possibility that it might launch a sneak attack. Qin Yu and I will take turns controlling the Sumeru ring. Flower Granny, Dean Lei, you stay inside with everyone else for a while.”

Yan Ruoxue thought for a moment but still could not be at ease. Provided not run into the monster race army, he and Qin Yu could handle it.

“Alright, I’ll give you the coordinates. The Ji family members are at a place on the edge of the Fire Unicorn Continent. It’s hard to find them there. Nearly 300,000 humans are living there. It’s considered quite a big town.”

Ji Yue explained the location to Yan Ruoxue and Qin Yu in detail.

“Great! We should be able to reach in half a day.”

Yan Ruoxue carefully checked the location and set off.

In less than half a day, under Yan Ruoxue’s extreme speed, they arrived at the town where Ji Yue’s family members lived.

It was a secret space, and the entrance was tremendously small. Only after passing through a long and narrow road could it open up and discover this massive land.

There were indeed tens of millions of places like this.

It was not just in purgatory but in the Holy Region as well.

Humans had been standing at the top for many years. Wherever they had been, there might be remnants of fire left behind by the humans.

Moreover, in a small town like this, there was a bewitching formation at the entrance that could prevent the invasion of the monster race to a certain extent.

“This town hasn’t been invaded yet. Moreover, it seems that some cultivators are protecting this town. This should be one of the reasons why this place is relatively peaceful.”

When they arrived, Qin Yu discovered this place was different from the places they had been earlier. There were no signs of war.

Ji Yue heaved a sigh of relief when she saw this because these people had come here long ago with hidden names.

They had been spies for the Ji family for their entire lives. If anything happened to them, Ji Yue would feel guilty.

When they entered the town, the guards only glanced at them briefly before letting them in.

Different races cultivated different Path of Heaven so they could sense whether they were humans or not.

Unless there was a supreme treasure that could change internal qi, one could determine whether it was a human or a monster just by sensing it.
