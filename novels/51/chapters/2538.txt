2539 Power in the Dark

“Qin Yu, I’m sorry. Martial Uncle Xinghe said you’re the only cosmic luck we saw here, so we had no choice but to ask for your help.”

“Forget it. I’m already here…”

There was no way out since they had already entered the Misty Forest.

The Primordial Sky Concealing Mirror’s speed was not fast. Moreover, Shen Qian had deliberately controlled its flying speed to avoid attracting the attention of the experts in the forest.

Therefore, they had to advance for nearly three days before they finally finished walking the outer perimeter.

“Be careful. The core of the Misty Forest is right in front of us.”

Xuan Xin’s expression was tremendously grim as he looked at the pitch-black forest before him.

As the group entered the depths, Qin Yu’s expression changed. Waves of dark power washed over his sea of consciousness from all directions.

“Keep these powers outside of the divine sense. Don’t let them enter the core of the divine sense. Otherwise, it will be disastrous.”

Xuan Tian reminded them by the side. A protective sword intent surged out of his body, isolating the dark power outside.

The moment the dark force struck Qin Yu, an atmosphere of darkness, terror, and despair rushed into Qin Yu’s mental world.

It was not just mental. The power seemed to corrode Qin Yu’s body at the same time.

Qin Yu could even feel physical and mental weakness setting in, and he knew it was just an illusion brought about by the dark power. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Merge the dark power! Become stronger! Dominate the world!”

An intense temptation emerged in Qin Yu’s heart. Even with Qin Yu’s powerful soul, he could feel the shock that his heart received.

He now began to understand why this area was the territory of the human race. The potent dark power was alluring to the cultivators, increasing the risk of corruption. The dark power could manipulate cultivators’ desires, fear, and negative emotions, enticing them to pursue power, revenge, or other evil goals. Cultivators might gradually lose their righteous path and be controlled by the dark power, eventually walking the path of monsters.

Under the repeated scouring of this kind of power, even the most formidable individuals, no matter how profound their strength, would probably collapse eventually.

A shocking thought surged into Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness. Saint Zi Yang might have also died because of this power.

Just as he let his imagination run wild, the Evil Eye in his hand suddenly trembled in excitement.

Qin Yu’s soul could sense its desire for the soul power and the dark power, but he forcefully suppressed Evil Eye’s trembling. If Evil Eye absorbed this power wantonly, it would attract the attention of these living beings in the dark.

But as they went deeper in, the storm of the dark power stirred up, making him spend some energy to resist this power.

“If we go deeper in, we probably can’t hold on for long before we are discovered. Our spiritual power erupted in this environment to resist the dark power. Now, we’re as conspicuous as targets.”

Qin Yu’s golden eyes stared outside of the Primordial Sky Concealing Mirror. At this moment, their internal had already leaked out from the treasure light.

Especially the Heavenly Divination Sect’s Zhang Xiang and Li Yang. They seemed to have weaker soul power.

The two were resisting with great difficulty, so the leakage of their power was even more noticeable.

“We’ve been targeted! Get ready for battle!”

Xuan Xin suddenly stopped. A bronze sword instantly appeared in his hand.

The sword’s body was green and gave off a refreshing internal qi.

The moment the sword energy was released, a chill feeling like a stream of water brushed past everyone’s divine sense as if making the resisting soul power slightly at ease.

At this moment, when they saw the scene in front of them, they instantly gasped.

Nearly 20 black-robed men riding on bone wolves had appeared without them realizing it.

The skin of these black-robed living beings was as pale as snow. They were lifeless and seemed to lack blood flow.

The slightly exposed faces were distorted and full of malice and indifference.

Furthermore, their eyes were deep and bottomless, and the pupils were pitch-black.

“The undead of the monster race, be careful. These undead are the corpses of the human race experts who died here. Their souls were sealed by the dark power when they died, and after being invaded, they became undead. Although these undead experts had died, they utterly became the members of the darkness after their deaths, and they might be even stronger than when they were alive.”

Xuan Xin roared.

As he roared, he slashed out his sword, and a stream of sword intent as vast as flowing water illuminated the entire Misty Forest with a rosy hue across the sky.

Before the power of the first sword was exhausted, the second sword had already arrived and slashed out.

The Trickle Stream Sword Technique!

It was the well-known sword technique of the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect and the terrifying killing move of the Green Duckweed Sword.

The sword aura that was like flowing water continuously rushed out like a tidal wave, instantly striking the 20 undead.

“Retreat!”

“Retreat again!”

The terrifying strength of the 20 undead was suppressed by one person and one sword. Xuan Xin’s sword moves were like flowing water, flexible yet sharp.

When the last strike arrived, the 20 undead had already turned into dust, and there was no trace of their existence.

“Senior Brother Xuan Xin’s Trickle Stream Sword Technique seems to have become even more terrifying!”

Just as Zhang Xiang was about to say something, Xuan Xin shouted.

“Be careful!”

An obscure and withered incantation suddenly sounded in the Misty Forest. Qin Yu had heard that sound before.

It was similar to the chanting of a monster race priest. At the moment the trickle of sword energy forced out the dark power, Qin Yu’s divine sense swept across a tall priest in the distance who raised his staff while chanting.

The sky seemed to be attracted by his staff. It sank like a vortex funnel and gently touched the staff.

Evil Soul Grip!

An extremely shrill voice suddenly came from the mouth of the giant priest.

“What the f*ck is this!”

Zhang Xiang shouted, and his voice sounded a little frightened.

As the incantation ended, outside the layer of treasure light of the Primordial Sky Concealing Mirror, beyond them…

A soul as massive as a mountain appeared beside them at some unknown moment.

A twisted hand, emitting a cold chill and a rotten internal qi, held the entire magical light.

The hand appeared in a color ranging from pale to dark, with slender fingers and nails sharp as steel.

The shape of the evil spirit kept changing, sometimes forming human-like contours, sometimes blurring into obscurity. Within the dark smoke, one could faintly discern a pair of hollow eye sockets emitting a chilling and terrifying light.

This pair of eyes had no pupils. They were pure black as if they were the reflection of an abyss.
