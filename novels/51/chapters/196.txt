Chapter 197: The Power of an Inner Strength Grandmaster! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Jiang Gu’s arrival immediately brought the tense atmosphere to a climax!

Countless people greeted Jiang Gu one after another, and there were even shouts from the scene.

Jiang Gu’s eyes were only on Qin Yu.

He glared at Qin Yu and said coldly, “Little b * stard, you really dared to come!”

Qin Yu slowly stood up from the ground.

He put his hands behind his back and said with a nonchalant smile, “Old b * stard, I’ve been waiting for you for a long time. Have you washed your neck clean?”

Everyone at the scene went into an uproar!

Many people gasped!

Qin Yu didn’t take Jiang Gu seriously at all!

Jiang Gu’s expression was livid. He sneered and said, “Sharp-tongued brat, I’ll sew your mouth up for you later!”

After saying that, Jiang Gu took a step forward and arrived at the Eastern Cemetery in an instant.

The internal qi of an Inner Strength Grandmaster was released in an instant!

This terrifying aura instantly caused sand and stones to fly in the Eastern Cemetery!

“So this is an Inner Strength Grandmaster’s power!” Someone exclaimed.

Updates by

“How powerful. I even feel like I can’t breathe.”

“Inner Strength Grandmasters indeed live up to their reputation!”

After sensing this internal qi, Qin Yu frowned slightly.

The strength of this internal qi was clearly beyond Qin Yu’s imagination.

“You hurt my son and ruined my family’s reputation. If I don’t kill you, I, Jiang Gu, won’t be a human!” Jiang Gu raised his head and roared!

His voice was filled with inner strength, and it shook everyone’s eardrums until they felt pain!

Qin Yu looked at Jiang Gu coldly and said, “It was your son who took my things. As for Jiang Haoran, I didn’t want to hurt him at all. It was all because he refused to let go.”

“Cut the crap! Die!” Jiang Gu didn’t listen to him at all. He held his inner strength and raised his hand to attack Qin Yu!

The power of an Inner Strength Grandmaster exploded in an instant. The terrifying gust of wind from his first seemed to tear the air apart!

This punch was extremely powerful and instantly smashed into Qin Yu’s body!

“Boom!”

Qin Yu’s body flew out and crashed into the mountain rock!

The small mountain was covered with cracks and then collapsed!

Everyone was shocked!

Just a single punch was so powerful. The strength of an Inner Strength Grandmaster was beyond imagination!

“Is it over?” Someone frowned.

“If it’s over, it would be meaningless.”

Jiang Gu didn’t put his hands behind his back as he looked at Qin Yu coldly.

Soon, Qin Yu walked out of the ruins.

His clothes had been torn and it revealed his strong muscles.

But what was shocking was that Qin Yu’s body wasn’t injured at all.

“What a powerful punch.” Qin Yu looked at his body and murmured.

At the same time, Qin Yu sighed to himself.

The toughness of his body was also beyond imagination.

In the next second, Jiang Gu stepped forward again!

With surging killing intent, he arrived in front of Qin Yu in an instant.

With a “bang”, Qin Yu rose from the ground into the air!

Jiang Gu followed closely behind, and another punch landed on Qin Yu’s back!

Qin Yu, who had just soared into the air, fell heavily into the ground again!

A huge crater was created on the ground! However, Jiang Gu still didn’t give up.

Qin Yu was like a puppet, and he couldn’t resist at all!

“This... is a crushing defeat.”

“What is Qin Yu thinking? How dare he provoke Jiang Gu with his current level of strength?”

“It’s over. Qin Yu can’t fight back at all.”

Hong Wu was also shocked. Jiang Gu’s punches were beyond his imagination!

“If it were me, I would probably be dead by now,” Hong Wu murmured.

After a series of bombardment, Qin Yu was smashed into a deep pit.

The scene was completely silent.

After a long while, the deep pit didn’t move at all.

Jiang Gu looked in that direction coldly and said, “Even a peak-stage Inner Strength Past Master wouldn’t be able to withstand these punches. You’re dead meat.”

At this moment, a sound came from the deep pit.

A figure flew out from the deep pit with a swoosh!

Qin Yu’s body was covered with a faint dark golden light. His physical body was intact!

“As expected of an Inner Strength Grandmaster. Without the Saintly Body Technique, these few punches would be able to shatter my physical body.” Qin Yu looked at his own body and whispered.

Jiang Gu’s expression changed slightly. He said coldly, “Kid, it seems that you have quite some ability.”

Qin Yu looked at Jiang Gu and said in a sullen voice, “Jiang Gu, your strength is indeed stronger than I imagined.”

Jiang Gu narrowed his eyes and laughed loudly. “Kid, just now, I only used 50% of my strength. Otherwise, you would have already become a corpse!”

50% of his strength?

Everyone present gasped!

To have such power at close to 50% of his strength, how terrifying would his full strength be?

“Swoosh!”

Right at this moment, Jiang Gu approached again!

His fist was wrapped with strong inner strength, and it was approaching Qin Yu’s face!

“The same old trick? It’s useless!” Qin Yu roared and actually went up to meet it head-on!

“Clang!”

There was a deafening loud sound!

Qin Yu only felt his arm go numb, as if it was about to be shattered by this internal force!

“Boom!”

Jiang Gu didn’t stop there and approached him!

In the blink of an eye, the two sides exchanged more than ten punches, but Qin Yu was actually not at a disadvantage!

“How is this possible?! Qin Yu is only an Inner Strength Master Hands, but he actually exchanged blows with an Inner Strength Grandmaster?”

“Could it be that Qin Yu is concealing his strength?!”

“No one present can withstand these few punches from Jiang Gu!”

After more than ten punches, Qin Yu began to feel that his arm was a little unable to withstand it anymore!

Jiang Gu’s expression became increasingly sullen. The stalemate was an insult to him!

“Qin Yu, you have successfully angered me!” Jiang Gu raised his head and roared angrily while instantly raising his internal qi to its peak!

“Boom!”

Another punch!

After this punch, Qin Yu couldn’t take it anymore!

The full-strength attack of an Inner Strength Grandmaster was far beyond imagination!

Even with the augmentation of the Saintly Body Technique, Qin Yu’s arm was still nearly broken!

This internal force shook Qin Yu so much that he couldn’t stop vomiting blood!

“Swoosh!”

Qin Yu was smashed to the ground for the second time!

And this time, Qin Yu’s situation looked extremely bad.

His entire body was dyed red with blood, and his flesh was shattered, revealing his white bones!

Jiang Gu sneered and then laughed out loud!

“In front of an Inner Strength Grandmaster, you have no way to fight back.” Jiang Gu put his hands behind his back while feeling that victory was in his hands.

In the crowd, Yan Jiang frowned.

He stared at Qin Yu while thinking about something.

“Qin Yu, I will kill you now and take revenge for my son!” Jiang Gu shouted and slapped his palm down!

This palm could cover the sky and cover the earth! A huge palm condensed in the air!

The palm pressed down while crushing everything!

“Mr. Yan, it’s time for us to make our move!” Gao Rui said anxiously.

Just when Gao Rui was about to make his move, Yan Jiang stopped him.

“Wait a little longer.” Yan Jiang shook his head.

He remembered the first time he taught Qin Yu a lesson.

At that time, Qin Yu was knocked down by Yan Jiang several times, but he still stood up.

In the end, his potential exploded, and he even injured Yan Jiang!

“I believe that he won’t fall just like that.” Yan Jiang stared in Qin Yu’s direction and said coldly.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
