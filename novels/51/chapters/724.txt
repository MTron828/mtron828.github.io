Chapter 725: Awakening of Memories? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu walked all the way to the vicinity of Xiao Yu. She was emitting waves of white energy from her body.

The white energy was cold and gloomy, and not a single blade of grass grew wherever it passed.

The surrounding trees were rapidly decaying, but the dark energy was still spreading in all directions.

Qin Yu’s expression changed. If this internal qi attacked the entire Green Moon Villa, it would definitely be a disaster!

Therefore, Qin Yu hurriedly stepped forward. He raised his hand and burst out rays of golden light, blocking the spread of this internal qi.

The erosive power of that internal qi was extremely strong. Even Qin Yu’s golden light dimmed a little.

“What a terrifying internal qi.” Qin Yu frowned.

His body felt a trace of discomfort, as if he was about to be swallowed by this internal qi.

He looked at the originally lush trees around him, but at this moment, they were in a state of decline.

Boom!

At this moment, waves of terrifying internal qi erupted from Xiao Yu’s body.

In the next second, a dark cloud blotted out the sky and covered the dun!

“She’s... about to break through?” Qin Yu seemed to have realized something.

Xiao Yu was clearly showing signs of breaking through to the level of Martial Marquis!

Dark clouds covered the sky. The density of the clouds was even higher than when Qin Yu was receiving the heavenly tribulation!

Xiao Yu still had her eyes closed. Facing this heavenly tribulation, she didn’t seem to have much fear. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Kacha!”

A bolt of heavenly tribulation struck!

The strength of this heavenly tribulation was even more terrifying than when Qin Yu was receiving the heavenly tribulation!

Qin Yu couldn’t help but widen his eyes!

Seeing such a terrifying heavenly tribulation, even Qin Yu felt waves of fear!

“Crack!”

Another bolt of lightning struck, and this time, it was even stronger.

However, Xiao Yu was still sitting there, not moving an inch. The internal qi that was spreading to the surroundings suddenly began to shrink, and finally, it stuck tightly to Xiao Yu’s body! The internal qi that was spreading to the surroundings began to shrink! It was like a suit of armor!

“Crack!”

The heavenly tribulation descended once again, and ruthlessly smashed onto the layer of white internal qi!

What was shocking was that such a terrifying heavenly tribulation was actually unable to shake the white internal qi in the slightest!

“How terrifying...” Qin Yu couldn’t help but mutter in a low voice.

What exactly was this white internal qi, to actually be so hard?

Even the heavenly tribulation wasn’t worth mentioning in front of it!

“Could it be the masked woman’s backup plan?” Qin Yu thought to himself.

As for the relationship between Xiao Yu and the masked woman, it was still unclear.

But he could basically confirm that there must be a connection between them!

As he looked up at the blue heavenly tribulation that filled the sky, Qin Yu’s expression became more and more serious.

Cultivation was a heaven-defying force, so the higher one’s talent was, the more terrifying the heavenly tribulation during the tribulation would be.

Other than that, there was another reason that would affect the strength of the heavenly tribulation.

That was the threat that the tribulation transcenders posed to the human world, or rather, it was a good fortune in the path of cultivation.

For example, if a tribulation transcender killed many people, then her heavenly tribulation would definitely be even more terrifying.

The man with the mustache once said that the masked girl had killed countless people when she was alive. She was a complete devil.

If Xiao Yu was really the masked girl, then it was equivalent to relying on her special methods to avoid the invasion of time and break the rules of the Heavenly Dao!

Then her heavenly tribulation would be even more terrifying!

Qin Yu raised his head to look at the dark clouds that were still flickering in the sky, and his expression became even gloomier.

Even Qin Yu felt a chill run down his spine when he saw the heavenly tribulation of such a level.

Rumble..

The heavenly tribulation continued, and the white internal qi on Xiao Yu’s body became even denser.

It was like a layer of hard armor, blocking the heavenly tribulation that was coming down.

After more than ten heavenly tribulations fell, Xiao Yu wasn’t injured at all!

“How terrifying...” Qin Yu couldn’t help but mutter in a low voice.

If that layer of white internal qi could be made into armor, how terrifying would it be?

At this moment, Xiao Yu slowly opened her eyes.

She had already entered the Martial Marquis Realm!

Qin Yu quickly walked to her side and said, “Xiao Yu, how do you feel now?”

Xiao Yu said, “Very good.”

Her words were somewhat terse, and she seemed to be different from the cheeky Xiao Yu from before.

This made Qin Yu a little worried.

Could it be that as Xiao Yu’s strength increased, she would get closer and closer to the masked woman?

“No,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He had to find some time to inquire about the masked woman.

“I’m a little tired. I’ll go back and rest first,” Xiao Yu said to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Okay.”

After she left, Qin Yu walked to the coffin.

What surprised Qin Yu was that the dark energy in the coffin was almost empty.

“This...” Qin Yu couldn’t help but be stunned.

He used to think that the dark energy in the coffin was inexhaustible, but he didn’t expect Xiao Yu to completely absorb it in just one try...

“Xiao Yu’s cultivation path will probably be even more difficult than mine in the future.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

In the next few days, Qin Yu stayed near the Spiritual Spring almost all day.

He tried to find the connection with the Mystic Realm every day.

In three days, Qin Yu could easily grasp the connection and quickly find the location of the Mystic Realm.

“As long as I can find a way to open the Mystic Realm, this Mystic Realm will belong to me,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

At this moment, Chang Mang walked over from not far away.

“Qin Yu, the man with the mustache is back,” Chang Mang said.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Let’s go and take a look.”

The two of them walked into the hall, and the man with the mustache was sitting in the hall drinking tea.

Qin Yu walked quickly to him and said, “How is it? Have you found all the materials?”

The man with the mustache said proudly, “This is a piece of cake for me!”

“Okay, then don’t waste time. Let’s go,” said Qin Yu.

The man with the mustache mumbled, “Why are you always in such a hurry? I just came back...”

“Time is tight.” Qin Yu shook his head helplessly.

He returned to his room and brought Xiao Yu to the hall.

“Let’s go,” Qin Yu said to the man with the mustache.

The man with the mustache looked at Xiao Yu, but he only frowned.

“You... made a breakthrough?” The man with the mustache asked tentatively.

Xiao Yu nodded and said, “Yes, I just stepped into the Martial Marquis realm a few days ago.”

The man with the mustache’s expression immediately became a bit ugly, and his eyes were filled with a bit of fear.

Then, the man with the mustache grabbed Qin Yu’s arm and walked out of the hall.

“You’re going to the Immortal Slaying Sect because of her?” The man with the mustache asked with a frown.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “That’s right. There’s the tomb of the masked woman there. If she really is the masked woman, maybe...”

“Maybe she can find relevant memories,” the man with the mustache interrupted Qin Yu.

He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “If Xiao Yu really found the memory of the masked woman, have you thought about what to do?”

Qin Yu frowned and scratched his head. “No way. Even if she is related to the masked woman, they aren’t the same person.”
