Chapter 839: The Invitation to the Exchange Meeting

Hearing this, Qin Yu immediately became even more suspicious.

Even so, the conditions offered by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association were indeed tempting.

Since it was called a Holy Land of Cultivation, it was naturally a place with extremely dense spiritual energy. It was a perfect opportunity for cultivation.

“One month...” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

“If I can break through within this one month, everything will be solved easily.”

At that time, Qin Yu could also use this opportunity to establish his authority.

After the meeting ended, Chang Mang pulled Qin Yu along, planning to find a place to drink.

Qin Yu couldn’t delay it any longer. In addition, they hadn’t seen each other for a long time, so he agreed.

As soon as the two of them arrived at the restaurant, Qin Yu had just sat down when two people walked over from the door.

These two people were powerful, and their internal qi wasn’t ordinary. At a glance, it was obvious that they weren’t ordinary people.

They walked straight to Qin Yu’s table and said politely, “May I ask if you are Mr. Qin Yu?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Who are you people?”

“My name is Le Xian, and everyone calls me Uncle Le.”

The person who came was none other than Uncle Le.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “I don’t think I know you, right?”

Le Xian smiled faintly and said, “You don’t know me, but I have heard a lot about you.”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “If you have something to say, just say it. There’s no need to be polite.”

Le Xian glanced at Chang Mang and then said with a smile, “Can we talk in private?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “There’s no need. He’s one of us. If you have something to say, just say it.”

Seeing this, Le Xian simply sat down.

“Let’s drink together?” Chang Mang poured a glass of wine for Le Xian.

Le Xian didn’t stand on ceremony. He emptied the glass in his hand and said with a smile, “Qin Yu, I’m here for the exchange meeting.”

“Exchange meeting?” When he heard this, Qin Yu’s pupils constricted!

“That’s right. The exchange meeting will be held in the Mystic Realm three days later, and we are one of the organizers of the exchange meeting,” Le Xian said with a smile.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly and said, “What’s your relationship with Wan Guqiong?”

Le Xian said in surprise, “Wan Guqiong? The Wan family is also one of the organizers. Could it be that he has already invited you?”

“No.” Qin Yu shook his head.

Le Xian patted his chest and said, “That’s good. I came here this time to invite you to join the exchange meeting.”

“Invite me?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and couldn’t help but feel like laughing.

“Mr. Le, as far as I know, there seems to be a limited number of spots in this exchange meeting. It’s not easy to get a spot.”

“Now that you have taken the initiative to invite me, I have to doubt your purpose.”

When Le Xian heard this, he couldn’t help but laugh, “Mr. Qin, aren’t you a little too paranoid?”

“The purpose of the exchange meeting is to make money and obtain resources. We naturally hope that more outstanding people will participate.”

“In this way, we can also obtain more profits.”

“We have also heard of Mr. Qin’s deeds. You are an elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion and have powerful pill formulas in your hands.”

“Therefore, you are a rare talent for our exchange meeting. We naturally hope that you can participate.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

He touched his chin and felt that what Le Xian said seemed to make sense.

“What do you think, Mr. Qin?” Le Xian said with a smile.

Chang Mang couldn’t help but mutter, “What is the exchange meeting? Why are you participating in the Mystic Realm?”

Le Xian ignored Chang Mang and stared at Qin Yu. He said with a smile, “Mr. Qin, please give me an answer as soon as possible. If you are not willing to participate, we can only choose someone else.”

“Of course I am willing,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

“But... I have offended the Wan Guqiong. He said that he would never let me participate in the exchange meeting.”

Le Xian smiled and said, “Don’t worry about that. We and the Wan family do not come from the same Mystic Realm. He can not represent our family.”

Qin Yu thought for a moment, stood up and said, “Thank you, Mr. Le.”

Le Xian also quickly stood up and said, “I should be the one thanking you.”

The two shook hands, and then Le Xian said, “Then I won’t bother you anymore. See you in three days.”

“Okay.” Qin Yu nodded and agreed.

The two exchanged their contact details, and Le Xian left.

After Le Xian left, Chang Mang couldn’t help but ask, “What exactly is this exchange meeting?”

Qin Yu pondered for a moment and immediately explained to Chang Mang.

Chang Mang was confused by what he heard. In the end, he waved his hand and said, “Forget it, I can’t be bothered with it. Come, drink!”

This drinking lasted until midnight. Chang Mang got drunk, probably because he was happy.

However, Qin Yu wasn’t drunk at all. His mind was on what had happened recently.

First, it was the trip to the Mystic Realm of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. Now, Le Xian had taken the initiative to invite Qin Yu into the exchange meet. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Everything seemed to have gone too smoothly, so smoothly that it made people him a little suspicious.

After Qin Yu sent Chang Mang back, he went straight back to the mansion of the man with the mustache.

Qin Yu didn’t sleep the whole night.

No matter how he thought about it, he felt that it was strange, but he couldn’t find any loopholes in the matter.

The next morning, Qin Yu got up from the bed.

He sat on the bed and stroked his chin. He was still carefully analyzing recent events, trying to find any loopholes.

At this moment, there was a knock on the door from outside.

When the door opened, he saw Yao Meng standing at the door.

When he saw Yao Meng, Qin Yu’s expression instantly turned cold.

“What are you doing here?” Qin Yu asked with a cold look.

Yao Meng bit her lips and said, “Qin Yu, if I said that I never knew the purpose of the Wan Guqiong, would you believe me?”

“What do you think?” Qin Yu sneered.

“Everyone knows what Yan Ruoxue’s body means. How could you not know?”

Yao Meng explained, “Wan Guqiong told me was that he wanted to protect Yan Ruoxue! He said that he had always admired the Yan family and Old Mister Yan, so he wanted to protect Yan Ruoxue!”

“Moreover, I asked my father for help. I asked him to help and go to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association to ask for her.”

“Because I was rejected, I believed Wan Guqiong...”

Hearing this, Qin Yu frowned slightly.

“Is what you said true?” Qin Yu asked in confusion.

Yao Meng hurriedly nodded and said, “It’s absolutely true! If you don’t believe me, I can use my cultivation to swear!”

Qin Yu’s expression softened slightly.

“Come in. I have something to ask you,” Qin Yu said.

After welcoming Yao Meng into the room, Qin Yu went straight to the point and asked, “Let me ask you, is the exchange meeting true?”

“I heard my father mention it before. It shouldn’t be fake,” Yao Meng nodded and said.

Qin Yu touched his chin and said, “I have a question. The ones holding the exchange meeting are several aristocratic families from the Mystic Realm, right?”

“Mm.” Yao Meng continued to nod.

“Then... are these aristocratic families on good terms?” Qin Yu asked.
