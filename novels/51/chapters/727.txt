The two internal qi clashed at this moment.

Qin Yu could clearly feel the extreme killing intent on Xiao Yu’s body!

This killing intent was extremely pure. It was obvious that she wanted to kill him!

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly, and waves of golden light emitted from his body.

The mask in Xiao Yu’s hand trembled slightly, as if it would be worn on her face in the next second.

At this critical moment, Xiao Yu suddenly released her hand.

The murderous internal qi on her body also disappeared.

“Qin Yu, I have to go. You don’t have to worry about me,” Xiao Yu said helplessly.

Qin Yu immediately heaved a sigh of relief.

Fortunately, Xiao Yu was still the same Xiao Yu.

“The news of the mask in your hand has already been spread. If you go out alone, it is very likely that you will encounter danger,” Qin Yu said with a frown.

“Ruoxue regards you as her younger sister. You are also my younger sister. I won’t let you go.”

Xiao Yu rubbed her forehead and said, “Alright, I’ll listen to you. Alright?”

Seeing this, Qin Yu revealed a satisfied smile.

Of course, he still had some worries in his heart.

Because from Xiao Yu’s expression just now, she really didn’t seem to be joking.

“If there’s nothing else... Let’s hurry up and leave, shall we?” The man with the mustache said as he wiped the cold sweat off his forehead.

Qin Yu walked forward and said with a smile, “Did you plunder someone’s grave? Otherwise, why would you be so afraid?”

The man with the mustache glared at Qin Yu and said, “I really didn’t! Even if I really did plunder it, it was you who brought me to dig it up!”

Qin Yu spread his hands and said, “Alright. Anyway, there must be something between you and her.”

The man with the mustache scratched his head and said, “I think so too, but I don’t know what it is exactly...”

Qin Yu knew that the man with the mustache had many secrets, so he didn’t ask any more questions.

The three of them stepped into the array platform and left the Immortal Slaying Sect.

After the three of them left, an intense dark energy suddenly burst out from the Immortal Slaying Sect!

The entire ground of the Immortal Slaying Sect was buzzing, as if something was about to be born.

...

The three of them left the Immortal Slaying Sect and returned to the island.

“Alright, should we go back now?” Asked Xiao Yu.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Why are you in such a hurry to go back? I’ll take you out to relax.”

After saying that, Qin Yu looked at the man with the mustache and said seriously, “You can leave now.”

The man with the mustache glared and said, “You wish! Don’t think that I don’t know what you are planning. You are definitely going to look for some treasure!”

Hearing that, Qin Yu couldn’t help but shake his head.

Nothing could be hidden from this man with the mustache.

Just as the man with the mustache said, Qin Yu planned to look for that ten-thousand-year-old herb next.

As long as he could get his hands on this ten thousand year old herb, Qin Yu would have complete confidence that he would be able to step into the late stage of the Martial Marquis realm!

When that time came, Qin Yu would no longer have to worry about facing Blackie and Yan Jinyao.

“Alright then, you can come along too. It just so happens that we have an extra helper.” Qin Yu said.

According to the address given by Ning Kun, the place where the ten thousand year old herbs were born was located at a border city in the southwest of Pyro. It was called Tang City.

Although it was located at the border, it was rather prosperous.

It was because the environment here was just too good.

The four seasons were like spring. The birds sang and the flowers were fragrant. There were mountains and seas, attracting countless people to come and visit.

Many rich young masters would hold gatherings here, and many foreigners would also come here for their holidays.

Qin Yu bought three tickets to go to Tang City and was prepared to head there.

While waiting for the plane, Qin Yu opened the Martial Arts Forum.

He saw that Blackie was being publicized on the forum.

In the past few days, Blackie had beaten almost all the top martial artists in Jingdu, and even Han Xiu was defeated by him!

Qin Yu looked at the content on the phone and couldn’t help but frown slightly.

“Even Han Xiu lost?” The man with the mustache asked as he stuck his head out.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “There’s nothing strange about it. After all, Blackie is a Heaven Swallowing Python and has a natural advantage.”

“At the same level, it is very difficult for a human to defeat a Demon Beast, not to mention that he is an Earth Rank Demon Beast.”

The man with the mustache nodded and said in a deep voice, “It is said that the skin of the Heaven Swallowing Python is incomparably hard, comparable to Black Gold Stone. It is very difficult for an ordinary Martial Marquis to break through its defense.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh slightly.

A Demon Beast at the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm really gave people a headache.

Qin Yu continued to flip through his phone to find some clues about the ten-thousand-year-old herbs this time.

But unfortunately, Qin Yu searched through the entire Martial Arts Forum and didn’t find any information related to the ten-thousand-year-old herbs.

“Could it be that the Hong Yi Sect is lying to me?” Qin Yu frowned.

But the possibility wasn’t high, because the Hong Yi Sect had no reason to do so. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Or perhaps... The Jingdu Martial Arts Association is deliberately hiding this news?” Qin Yu suddenly thought of a possibility.

The Jingdu Martial Arts Association had always liked to control resources in their own hands.

These ten-thousand-year-old herbs were top-notch cultivation items. If they knew, they wouldn’t miss it.

“Even if there is news, it will probably be deleted by them.” Qin Yu shook his head helplessly.

It was unknown what people the Jingdu Martial Arts Association would send to snatch this ten-thousand-year-old herb.

Qin Yu casually fiddled with his phone. Just as he was about to close the forum, he saw a message that had just been sent:

Blackie had issued a challenge to Jiang He, and Jiang He had accepted the challenge!

Seeing this message, Qin Yu hurriedly opened the message.

He saw that the message indicated the location and time of the fight between the two of them.

The location was on the West Hengshan Mountain in Jingdu, and the time was three days later.

“Blackie actually wants to challenge Jiang He? One must know that Jiang He is the number one person in Pyro!”

“I have to admire Blackie’s courage.”

“It isn’t certain who will win or lose. Han Xiu has already lost to Blackie, so who can guarantee that Jiang He won’t lose?”

“Times are changing. It’s hard to say who will win or lose.”

Qin Yu held his phone and frowned.

He never expected that Blackie would challenge Jiang He!

“Jiang He... Blackie is really arrogant,” the man with the mustache muttered.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “I don’t know if Jiang He can win or not.”

The man with the mustache spread his hands and said, “It’s hard to say. Blackie is a Heaven Swallowing Python after all.”

“However, I have to admire the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. Using Jiang He to establish their might is really clever.”

Qin Yu nodded.

Blackie challenged Jiang He. Regardless of whether he won or lost, he would be famous all over the world.

Jiang He was extremely famous. The fight between the two of them would bring about a great deal of sensationalism!

On the Martial Arts Forum, there were even people betting on who would win or lose between Jiang He and Blackie.

“Speaking of which, I remember that Jiang He has retired. Why would he accept Xiao Hei’s challenge?” The man with the mustache asked in confusion.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything.

He remembered the last time he fought with Geng Si.

“Jiang He seems to have the intention to return to the martial arts world.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.
