Chapter 727: Xiao Yu’s Abnormality Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The entire tomb was filled with gusts of cold wind. Qin Yu was certain that this cold wind was coming for Xiao Yu!

Qin Yu didn’t dare to think too much. He held Xiao Yu’s hand and quickly walked towards the depression.

Xiao Yu’s hand was extremely cold. It was as if he was holding onto a piece of ice.

After walking for a long time, Qin Yu and Xiao Yu finally arrived at the depression.

Qin Yu flicked her finger and lit up the spiritual fire to illuminate the depression.

Under the dim light, Xiao Yu looked a little strange.

Her face was extremely pale, and her pupils were a little glazed.

“Xiao Yu?” Qin Yu called out tentatively.

Xiao Yu seemed to have come back to her senses. She glanced at Qin Yu and frowned. “Where is this? Why do I have a strange feeling...”

“A strange feeling? What exactly is it?” Qin Yu asked hurriedly.

Xiao Yu remained silent. She ignored Qin Yu and walked forward.

She placed her palm on the wall and slowly searched, as if she was looking for something.

A few minutes later, Xiao Yu’s hand suddenly stopped at a certain spot.

Then, he saw Xiao Yu’s hand flashing with light and she slapped it!

The wall instantly collapsed and turned into ruins!

And in the ruins, there was a small ring lying there.

The ring was entirely dark green, and in the darkness, it flickered with a weak and strange light.

Xiao Yu picked up the ring and said in a low voice, “This ring... seems to be calling me.”

“Calling you?” Qin Yu was a little surprised.

“But I keep feeling that I can’t take this ring away. There seem to be two voices in my heart.” Xiao Yu’s voice suddenly trembled.

The next second, a trace of anguish flashed across her face.

“Ah... my head hurts...” Xiao Yu grabbed her hair with both hands, her face distorted in pain.

Qin Yu hurriedly held Xiao Yu and said anxiously, “Xiao Yu, are you okay?”

Xiao Yu ignored Qin Yu. She scratched her head and looked extremely painful.

“Buzz!”

At this moment, the ring suddenly flashed with a ray of light.

The ray of light shot toward Xiao Yu and headed straight for her glabella!

Qin Yu didn’t know what this ray of light was. In order to prevent any accidents, Qin Yu hurriedly reached out his hand and tried to stop it.

However, the ray of light was too fast. In a flash, it disappeared into Xiao Yu’s glabella.

“Xiao Yu!” Qin Yu hurriedly held Xiao Yu, his expression anxious.

Xiao Yu stood there silently, not saying a word.

“Xiao Yu?” Qin Yu called out tentatively, but Xiao Yu still ignored him.

A moment later, Xiao Yu raised her head and looked at Qin Yu with a pair of cold eyes.

This gaze was very similar to the masked woman’s! It made one’s back go numb!

“Are you alright?” Qin Yu had an ominous premonition in his heart.

Xiao Yu didn’t say a word and looked at Qin Yu coldly.

There was an extremely cold internal qi on her body. Even Qin Yu felt some fear.

“I’m fine.” Xiao Yu finally spoke.

She took the ring and put it on her middle finger.

Then, Xiao Yu turned around and left without saying a word.

Qin Yu didn’t know what to do for a moment, so he could only follow behind Xiao Yu.

They walked out of the tomb, and the moment they left, the tomb collapsed! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The man with the mustache not far away rushed over and asked tentatively, “How is it? Are you okay?”

Before Qin Yu could speak, Xiao Yu looked at the man with the mustache coldly.

The man with the mustache’s expression changed when he felt Xiao Yu’s cold gaze.

He subconsciously took two steps back with a serious expression on his face.

“I’ve seen you before,” Xiao Yu looked at the man with the mustache and said coldly.

The man with the mustache shivered when he heard this!

“We... We’ve just met,” the man with the mustache said as he braced himself.

Xiao Yu didn’t say anything. She just glanced at the man with the mustache coldly.

The man with the mustache quickly turned his head to the side and didn’t say anything more.

Xiao Yu didn’t say anything. She turned around and left.

Qin Yu frowned. He took a step forward and blocked Xiao Yu’s way.

“Xiao Yu, what happened to you? How do you feel?” Qin Yu asked.

Xiao Yu looked at Qin Yu in front of her and said, “I’m fine, Qin Yu. Thank you for taking care of me.”

“What?” Qin Yu was even more confused.

Xiao Yu also seemed to frown. She shook her head and said, “I’m fine. I don’t know why I said that. Just pretend that you didn’t hear anything.”

This made Qin Yu even more confused. He frowned and said, “Did you remember something? Or... do you have memories that don’t belong to you?”

“No, you don’t have to worry,” Xiao Yu said concisely.

Qin Yu subconsciously glanced at the man with the mustache, but the man with the mustache looked flustered and broke out in cold sweat.

“Where is my thing?” Xiao Yu suddenly asked.

The “thing” she was talking about clearly referred to the mask.

“It’s not safe to leave the mask with you. I’ll keep it for you for now,” Qin Yu said.

Xiao Yu said coldly, “It’s safest to leave it with me.”

Before he finished speaking, Qin Yu felt the Spatial Magic Artifact.

In the next second, the mask flew out of the Spatial Magic Artifact and landed in Xiao Yu’s hand.

Xiao Yu stroked the mask and said in a low voice, “It’s really strange... why do I have this feeling?”

“What feeling?” Qin Yu hurriedly asked.

Xiao Yu shook her head and said, “It’s nothing, Qin Yu. I’m going on a long trip.”

“A long trip? Where? I’ll go with you.” Qin Yu frowned and said.

“No need. There seems to be a voice in my heart. This voice has been calling me.” Xiao Yu sighed slightly.

“Although I don’t know what the reason is, my intuition tells me that I must go.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “What if I don’t let you go?”

Xiao Yu’s expression immediately darkened.

An extremely strong dark energy burst out from her body!

The ice-cold internal qi instantly engulfed more than half of the Immortal Slaying Sect, and the mask in Xiao Yu’s hand also trembled slightly.

Qin Yu suddenly had a bad feeling. He circulated the internal qi in his body and was ready to fight.
