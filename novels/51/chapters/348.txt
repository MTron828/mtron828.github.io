Chapter 349: The Man At The Top In The Future! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Their eyes met, and the secretary couldn’t help but frown.

He was just about to ask, “Why are you here?” When Old Mister Yan walked out and said with a smile, “Qin Yu, relax and don’t feel too much psychological pressure.”

“I got it, Old Mister Yan.” Qin Yu bowed.

When he saw the way the two of them were talking, the secretary’s expression became even uglier. The words that he wanted to say were forcefully held back.

It was very obvious that not only Yan Ruoxue had high hopes for Qin Yu, but even the head of the Yan family had high hopes for Qin Yu.

As a mere secretary, what could he dare to say?

“Mr. Qin, please... Get in the car.” The secretary opened the car door for Qin Yu.

Fortunately, Qin Yu wasn’t a petty person. He did not say anything and turned around to get into the car.

The car sped towards the reception.

On the way, Yan Ruoxue and Qin Yu said that there were many such receptions in their social circle.

On the surface, it looked like they were just eating, drinking, and having fun. However, the purpose was to increase the cohesion and communication between the families.

As long as there were people, there would definitely be a small social circle. For the blue-blood families, this situation was obvious.

The car arrived at a hotel.

This hotel had already been booked by someone, and the entrance was filled with luxury cars.

Updates by

Yan Ruoxue pointed at the cars outside and said, “Look at the models outside. If there are more commercial cars, it means that it’s a business gathering.”

“On the other hand, if there are more sports cars with exaggerated models, it’s a gathering for the children of the rich.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. However, there were both commercial luxury cars and sports cars parked outside today.

After the car was parked, Yan Ruoxue took the initiative to wrap her arms around Qin Yu’s arm.

“Let’s go.” Yan Ruoxue blinked and said.

Qin Yu lowered his head and looked at Yan Ruoxue, who was hugging him. He couldn’t help but say shyly, “You... aren’t you afraid that others will misunderstand?”

Hearing this, Yan Ruoxue blinked and said, “Don’t you want to declare your sovereignty?”

Qin Yu was stunned. He took a deep breath and nodded hard. “Of course I want to! I will tell everyone that you are mine.”

After saying that, Qin Yu took the initiative to wrap his arm around Yan Ruoxue’s arm and strode into the hotel.

The cocktail party was set up on the top floor. There were no rooms on the top floor, only a hall.

The security measures for the banquet were perfect. The moment they reached the top floor, they saw two guards.

These two guards were actually Inner Strength Grandmasters!

“Inner Strength Grandmasters acting as security is really over the top.” Qin Yu stuck out his tongue.

Up until now, Qin Yu still didn’t know what kind of power these great aristocratic families had!

He was even less aware of how many top-tier martial artists they had working for them!

After he pushed open the door and entered, a wave of music entered his ears.

Unlike at ordinary cocktail parties, the music here wasn’t boisterous. Instead, it was extremely refined and moving.

Yan Ruoxue’s arrival immediately attracted countless gazes.

“Miss Yan.” Very quickly, someone came over with a wine glass in hand.

They greeted Yan Ruoxue with a humble attitude. Their posture looked extremely peaceful.

However, Qin Yu knew very well that their amiable attitude was all a facade.

In other words, what attitude they had depended on who they were facing.

Today, at the banquet, all of them were gentle and refined, but when facing ordinary people, all of them were extremely arrogant and contemptuous.

“Miss Yan, this is?” Very soon, someone looked at Qin Yu.

Before Yan Ruoxue could answer, Qin Yu pulled Yan Ruoxue into his arms and said, “My name is Qin Yu, and I’m Yan Ruoxue’s boyfriend.”

As soon as he said that, everyone was shocked!

Everyone’s eyes widened, and even the music stopped!

“Miss Yan, this... This gentleman is joking, right?”

Everyone looked at Yan Ruoxue in unison, as if waiting for Yan Ruoxue’s answer.

Yan Ruoxue raised her head and glanced at Qin Yu, then said with a nonchalant smile, “That’s right, Qin Yu is indeed my boyfriend.”

Hiss!

Countless people gasped at this moment!

Everyone in Jingdu knew that Yan Ruoxue was famous for being aloof. Although there was an endless stream of suitors, all of them failed!

Qin Yu, who suddenly appeared today, was completely unheard of!

“Mr. ... Mr. Qin.” No one knew who was the first to react, but they quickly raised their wine glasses and toasted Qin Yu.

Then, the others followed suit and began to introduce themselves to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu responded to each of them one by one. In just half an hour, Qin Yu had drunk a kilogram of foreign wine.

He found a place to sit down after finally getting some free time.

Qin Yu wiped the sweat from his forehead and couldn’t help but mutter, “These people are really enthusiastic. I feel a little embarrassed.”

Yan Ruoxue shook her head and said, “Don’t be swayed by their superficial enthusiasm. These people are only interested in profit. Even if they call you their buddy today, they might turn against you tomorrow.”

The more benefits involved, the more complicated human nature became.

To them, feelings were a luxury.

After the crowd dispersed, they began to discuss in low voices.

“What’s Qin Yu’s background? How come I’ve never heard of him?”

“I don’t know. There isn’t such a person in Jingdu, right?”

“Winning over the eldest daughter of the Yan family is really something worthy of praise.”

“Speaking of which, hasn’t Han Wei, the Young Master of the Han family, been pursuing Yan Ruoxue? If this matter were to spread to the Han family’s ears, then...”

“It mainly depends on Old Mister Yan’s attitude. As long as Emperor Yan makes the decision, the Han family can only watch helplessly.”

Even though their voices were very soft, Qin Yu could still hear them clearly.

He frowned slightly and couldn’t help but think to himself, ‘Today’s action might bring him a lot of trouble.’

Of course, Qin Yu wasn’t afraid. Since he dared to say it, he would take the responsibility.

“Miss Yan.” At this moment, a man with large strides walked over from not far away.

This man’s figure wasn’t considered burly, but his steps were steady and his bearing was extraordinary.

Qin Yu focused his gaze and his expression couldn’t help but change slightly.

When facing this person, it was as if he was facing an endless ocean.

“The peak of an Inner Strength Grandmaster? Or even... a level that surpasses Inner Strength Grandmaster?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but think to himself.

Yan Ruoxue stood up and smiled, “Mr. Xia.”

The man called Mr. Xia smiled and said, “Miss Yan, your words are truly shocking. I don’t know how many people’s hopes have been shattered by your words today.”

As he spoke, Mr. Xia’s body emitted a wave of pressure.

A terrifying pressure was coming straight for Qin Yu!

This pressure was beyond imagination. Even Qin Yu found it difficult to withstand it. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

His entire body trembled, as if he was about to be pressed to the ground at any moment.

Facing an opponent that far surpassed him, Qin Yu circulated the spirit energy in his body and resisted with all his might.

A small confrontation instantly formed between the two. Tension was in the air.

Qin Yu’s forehead dripped with sweat. Facing this force, Qin Yu found it difficult to bear and was on the verge of collapse.

Fortunately, at this time, Mr. Xia withdrew his pressure, and a hint of contempt flashed through his eyes.

“Miss Yan, what is Qin Yu’s background? How come I’ve never heard of him?” Mr. Xia asked with a smile.

Yan Ruoxue thought for a moment and said, “Well... he’s the man who will stand at the top of Jingdu in the future.”
