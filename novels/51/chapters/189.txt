Chapter 190: The Head of the Jiang Family Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

At this moment, Qin Yu knew nothing about the state of Chuzhou.

He was doing his best to refine pills for Yang Jing.

Because this was a long-term treatment process, Qin Yu planned to refine a month’s worth of pills for Yang Xiao in one go in case there wasn’t enough.

Two days passed in the blink of an eye.

The news was still circulating in Chuzhou.

On this day, an earth-shattering sound erupted in the Jiang family’s home!

A rainbow light descended from the sky and sprinkled on one of the Jiang family’s mansions!

When Mr. Zhong saw this rainbow light, his face immediately revealed joy!

“This... This is the sign of an Inner Strength Grandmaster breaking through!” Mr. Zhong suddenly stood up and stared fixedly at this ray of light!

“The family head... has finally become an Inner Strength Grandmaster!”

Mr. Zhong hurriedly looked at the people around him and shouted, “Inform everyone to welcome the patriarch out of seclusion!”

“Yes!”

Dozens of people rushed towards the mansion!

They stood at the entrance of the mansion and knelt on the ground in unison while waiting for the Patriarch of the Jiang family to come out of seclusion! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

After a while, the rainbow light in the sky began to dissipate.

Jiang Yu also rushed to the scene when he heard the news.

“Mr. Zhong, has my father come out?” Jiang Yu asked anxiously.

Mr. Zhong shook his head and said, “We are also waiting.”

A hint of viciousness flashed across Jiang Yu’s face. He gritted his teeth and said, “My father is finally coming out of seclusion. Qin Yu, I will definitely tear you into pieces!”

Creak.

At this moment, the door of the mansion slowly opened!

When he heard the sound of the door opening, everyone looked at the door nervously!

They saw a tall and burly old man with a long beard walking out of the mansion.

Although he had a head full of white hair, he didn’t look old at all.

Not a single wrinkle could be seen on his skin. His spirit and temperament made him look like a middle-aged man in his prime!

His internal qi was exceptionally stable. At a glance, it was as if he had returned to his youth!

This was the master of the Jiang family, Jiang Gu!

“Welcome out of seclusion, master!” Mr. Zhong was the first to shout!

Following that, the entire Jiang family shouted in loud voices in unison!

Jiang Gu swept his gaze across the crowd, then he quickly arrived in front of Mr. Zhong.

“Mr. Zhong, how long have I been in closed-door cultivation?” Jiang Gu asked indifferently.

Mr. Zhong hurriedly replied, “A whole three years!”

“Three years...” Jiang Gu muttered in a low voice, “I didn’t expect it to be so long.”

Mr. Zhong probed, “Sir, have you stepped into the legendary realm?”

Jiang Gu placed his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “After three years of forbearance and three years of breakthrough, I’ve finally reached the realm of an Inner Strength Grandmaster.”

Mr. Zhong was immediately overjoyed and hurriedly said, “Congratulations sir! From today onwards, you will ascend to the top of Chuzhou and the world!”

Jiang Gu didn’t have the slightest expression on his face upon hearing Mr. Zhong’s flattery.

Jiang Gu looked quite loftyy, as if he was an immortal!

Even though people couldn’t feel the slightest bit of internal qi when facing Jiang Gu, they were still filled with reverence, as if they were facing a lofty mountain!

“How has the Jiang family been during my absence?” Finally, Jiang Gu asked the most crucial question!

Mr. Zhong, not knowing what to say, opened his mouth.

“Not good, not good at all!” At this moment, Jiang Yu ran over.

“Dad, during your absence, no one has been taking the Jiang family seriously anymore!” Jiang Yu said angrily.

When he heard this, a murderous aura suddenly burst out from Jiang Gu’s body!

Everyone instantly felt their bodies turn ice-cold, and their bodies trembled non-stop!

Jiang Gu looked at Jiang Yu coldly. The bone-piercing coldness made Jiang Yu dare not to look directly into Jiang Gu’s eyes!

“Where’s Haoran? Why isn’t he here?”

At this moment, Jiang Gu suddenly asked.

Compared to Jiang Yu, Jiang Gu liked Jiang Haoran more.

Because no matter which aspect it was, Jiang Haoran was far above Jiang Yu.

Jiang Yu was a good-for-nothing profligate son.

Mr. Zhong sighed and said, “Sir, the Eldest Young Sir, he...”

At this point, Mr. Zhong didn’t continue.

Jiang Gu frowned slightly and said, “What happened to Haoran?”

“My brother was beaten into a vegetable and is still lying on the hospital bed!” Jiang Yu said with some resentment.

As soon as Jiang Yu said this, a terrifying internal qi burst out from Jiang Gu’s body!

The moment this internal qi burst out, everyone felt a huge pressure on their backs and subconsciously knelt down!

After he felt the terrifying killing intent from Jiang Gu’s body, Mr. Zhong’s face turned extremely pale!

“What’s going on?” Jiang Gu looked at Mr. Zhong coldly.

Mr. Zhong gritted his teeth and slapped himself in the face. With a face full of self-reproach, he said, “It’s all my fault for not taking good care of the Eldest Young Master...”

Then, Mr. Zhong told Jiang Gu the truth about what had happened.

After Jiang Gu heard it, his expression turned terrifyingly cold!

“Dad, it’s all Qin Yu’s fault! He doesn’t take the Jiang family seriously at all!” Jiang Yu said angrily.

“Because of Qin Yu, many people are no longer afraid of the Jiang Family!”

Jiang Gu looked at Jiang Yu coldly. Then, he raised his palm, and a terrifying internal qi instantly sent Jiang Yu flying!

“Useless thing, for the sake of a pill, you put the Jiang Family in such a difficult situation. What’s the use of having a good-for-nothing like you?!” Jiang Gu scolded coldly.

Jiang Yu spat out blood. He hurriedly got up from the ground and said in fear, “Dad, I... I was wrong...”

Jiang Gu snorted again and again. He said coldly, “Take me to Haoran’s ward.”

“Yes, master,” Mr. Zhong bowed and said.

In the ward, Jiang Haoran laid motionless on the bed.

Although he was still breathing, he looked no different from a dead person.

Upon seeing his son in such a situation, Jiang Gu couldn’t contain his anger anymoew!

“Ever since I experienced that incident, I have been treading on thin ice because I was afraid of offending someone I shouldn’t,” Jiang Yu muttered in a low voice, as if he was reminiscing.

“Now, the people of Chuzhou have already forgotten about me, Jiang Gu.” Jiang Gu’s words carried a strong murderous aura!

“It’s fine if people from Jingdu bullies me, but how dare people from Chuzhou not take me seriously?!”

With his roar, the entire room seemed to tremble!

Mr. Zhong stood at the side silently.

Back then, Jiang Gu was extremely high-profile. He didn’t even take the top dog in Chuzhou seiously.

It wasn’t until three years ago, when Jiang Gu offended a rich kid from Jingdu and almost got the entire Jiang family destroyed that Jiang Gu began to restrain himself.

This also gave other families an opportunity to slowly develop.

But Jiang Gu never thought that his son would be beaten into a vegetable!

“Looks like it’s time to tell them that I, Jiang Gu, have returned,” Jiang Gu said coldly.
