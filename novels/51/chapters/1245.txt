Chapter 1246: Chapter 1,246. The anxious crowd 

Ever since the ancient array platform had been opened, the passageway had seemed to have closed, and no one had descended.

This caused the reclusive experts to have a bad premonition.

“Could it be... that the last time was the only time.”

This thought lingered in the minds of the experts.

Although they had sealed their lifespans, they couldn’t maintain it for too long.

If they were unable to increase their cultivation for a long time, it meant that their lifespans would slowly fade away.

“Hopefully, that won’t be the last time. Otherwise... I’m afraid we’ll have to continue sealing it away.”A major power sighed repeatedly in his heart.

If they sealed it away again, who knew how long it would take? No one was willing to endure that kind of lonely pain again.

...

In the first mystic realm, Qin Yu was still in closed-door cultivation.

The blood seemed to be boiling. Gurgling sounds came out as it continuously surged into Qin Yu’s body.

And the improvement that the blood brought to Qin Yu was even greater than imagined.

It was not just the remodeling of the body. If Qin Yu could activate his spiritual power, his spiritual power would also receive a huge increase.

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu had been in seclusion for eighteen days.

The blood in the bathtub was also becoming less and less.

At this rate, it would take a few days at most for the blood to be completely absorbed.

The outside world welcomed a rare peace.

Everything seemed to be back on track, and everyone was doing their own things step by step.

Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, several days had passed.

On this day, Qin Yu stood up from the bathtub.

There was not a single trace of red on his body, and all of his blood had been absorbed into Qin Yu’s body.

The changes in his body were even more obvious.

“This improvement is many times stronger than the strengthening agent,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He clenched his fist lightly, and his body was filled with incomparably dense godly power. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

This power could move mountains and overturn seas, and was incomparably powerful.

“If it was my current body, even if Jiang Yi bombarded me with all his might, it would be very difficult for him to hurt me,”Qin Yu sighed.

Although he didn’t have the support of spiritual energy, Qin Yu was extremely confident.

In his current state, even if he went to the saint-level, he wouldn’t be afraid of most people.

Of course, there were many experts in the holy region, and their spells were even more unpredictable.

Although they could not shake Qin Yu’s physical body, it did not mean that they could not wipe out Qin Yu’s divine sense. Therefore, if they stepped into the holy region, they still had to be careful.

Then, Qin Yu turned around and walked out of the first secret realm.

He returned to the Heaven Gate and found Di Zun.

“How long has it been since I went into seclusion?”Qin Yu asked.

Di Zun calculated the time and said, “Thirty-one days.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

It had been so long?

“Is there still no news from the ancient array platform?”Qin Yu frowned and asked.

Di Zun spread his hands and said, “No. I pay attention to the martial arts forum every day. There is no news.”

This made Qin Yu somewhat suspicious.

It had been a long time since the ancient array platform was opened last time. How could there be no news?

“Could it be that those few mighty figures are hiding the news?”Qin Yu thought to himself.

After thinking about it, Qin Yu decided to go to the ancient array platform to take a look.

But before Qin Yu could leave, those twenty reclusive mighty figures arrived at the Heaven Gate.

They walked together and entered the great hall, their faces filled with worry.

“Why are you here?”Qin Yu said in surprise.

“Qin Yu, we’ve been waiting for that ancient array platform for two months, but there’s still no news. What’s going on?”

“That’s right. Don’t tell me we have to wait endlessly?”

“My lifespan can’t last for too long. At most one or two years.”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, then sighed. “This isn’t something I can decide. I also hope that the ancient array platform can be opened as soon as possible.”

“Sigh, if this really doesn’t work, I’m afraid we’ll have to continue sealing our lifespans.”A powerful expert sighed, a hint of unwillingness flashing across his face.

“Perhaps we’ve already missed the best opportunity. We’re destined to not have the chance to enter the Holy Region.”

Qin Yu thought for a moment, then said, “How about this? I currently have two array flags in my hands. Everyone can go look for the array flags. As long as we gather eight of them, we won’t need to rely on them to extradite us.”

“We’ve naturally heard of those array flags before. However, it’s easier said than done to find them.”A mighty figure shook his head.

“That’s right. Everyone knows that it’s very difficult to obtain those array flags. It’s easier said than done.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “There’s nothing we can do about it. Rather than waiting for death, we might as well give it a try.”

“It’s better to rely on ourselves than others. Even if there really are people from the holy region who have descended, they might not choose you, who are already at the end of their rope.”

These words reminded the various major powers.

Since the Holy Region had come to extradite them, they naturally hoped to obtain fresh blood to improve their own sects.

Although these twenty-plus people were in the mighty realm, they had long entered the declining realm. There might not be any sects that would take a fancy to them.

“Qin Yu, you have to think of a way for us.”A major power hurriedly stepped forward.

“That’s right. We’ve been waiting for so many years just to step into the Holy Region.”

Everyone was anxious. They thought of Qin Yu as a life-saving straw and surrounded Qin Yu.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “Everyone, don’t be anxious. If I have a way, I’ll definitely bring everyone to the holy region. I Won’t leave anyone behind.”

Even though that was the case, they were still a little worried.

“Of course, if everyone can find the teleportation array flag, they will naturally have a better choice.”Qin Yu changed the topic and said with a smile.

“Sigh, this is the only way.”Someone Sighed.

“Qin Yu, we will go look for the array flag now. If there is any news, you must inform us.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Of course.”
