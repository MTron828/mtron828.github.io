When he heard Lincheng’s words, Qin Yu’s expression instantly turned cold.

He had never expected Lincheng to turn hostile in the blink of an eye.

“Uncle Lin, who is this person?” Qi Yang looked at Qin Yu with a gentle smile on his face.

Lincheng said indifferently, “I originally wanted him to come and help, but since you’re here, I don’t need him anymore.”

“Yes, Qi Yang, this b*stard bullied me. You must avenge me!” Lin Wan said angrily.

“Oh? So he’s also an expert?” Qi Yang’s eyes showed great interest.

Then, he walked to Qin Yu’s side and said indifferently, “Are you also an inner strength expert?” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“No,” Qin Yu answered without thinking.

Qin Yu didn’t lie. He really didn’t know what inner strength was because he was an immortal cultivator.

Strictly speaking, he was much stronger than the so-called inner strength masters.

But to Qi Yang, Qin Yu was just a loser who hadn’t generated inner strength yet.

“You aren’t even an inner strength master, yet you have the guts to stand up for other people?” Qi Yang’s eyes flashed with ridicule.

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered to waste his time on Qi Yang. He stood up and looked at Lincheng while saying, “If that’s the case, then I’ll take my leave. However, I hope you won’t regret it.”

Lincheng said with a smile, “Don’t worry, I won’t regret it.”

“Master, you!” Lance’s expression was extremely unsightly. He wanted to say something, but was stopped by Qin Yu, who reached out his hand and stopped him.

“Mr. Qin!” At this moment, Lincheng suddenly called out to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu stopped in his tracks, turned around and said, “What’s the matter, Mr. Lin?”

Lincheng said with a smile, “Mr. Qin, please return that ginseng.”

Qin Yu, growing more and more disgusted with Lincheng’s behavior, narrowed his eyes slightly.

“Why? You don’t want to return it?” Lin Wan said while glaring at him.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “Send someone to my house to collect it tomorrow.”

“Master, aren’t you going too far?!” Lance couldn’t help but shout angrily.

Lincheng looked at Lance coldly and scolded, “You still know that I’m your master?! She was bullied by other people, and you’re actually helping an outsider!”

“I...” Lance suddenly fell silent and didn’t know what to say.

“Lance, let’s go.” Qin Yu patted Lance on the shoulder.

“If you leave today, you will no longer be my disciple! I won’t teach you any martial arts in the future!” Lincheng said coldly.

Lance stopped and Qin Yu looked at Lance.

Lance turned around and walked towards Lincheng.

Seeing this, Lincheng couldn’t help but laugh out loud as he said, “Good disciple!”

However, Lance walked to Lincheng’s side and bowed slightly, then said, “Thank you for all these years of tutelage. I just saw what kind of person you are today. From now on, there will be no more ties between us.”

After saying that, Lance pulled off his shirt and threw it on the ground.

“What an ungrateful b*stard.” Lincheng’s expression was cold.

“Lance, you better think it through. Today, when you leave, you won’t be able to learn anything from me anymore!” Lincheng shouted from behind.

At this time, Qin Yu sneered and said, “There’s no need to learn from a jack of all trades like you.”

“Hahaha! Don’t talk nonsense!” Lincheng couldn’t help but shout.

“Compared to ordinary people, you may be strong, but in the eyes of inner strength experts like us, you are nothing!” Lincheng laughed.

Qin Yu didn’t want to see Lincheng’s petty demeanor again, so he didn’t say anything.

“Lance, let’s go.” Qin Yu shouted and then walked toward the door.

Just as the two of them walked to the door, Qi Yang suddenly shouted, “Stop.”

Qin Yu stopped in his tracks.

With his back facing Qi Yang, he asked coldly, “Is there anything else?”

Qi Yang smiled and said, “You bullied her. This matter isn’t over yet.”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Why? Do you want to stand up for her?”

Qi Yang laughed and said, “Lin Wan is like my sister. I naturally have to stand up for her.”

“Thank you, Qi Yang. You’re the best!” Lin Wan shouted excitedly.

“I want you to break her legs, kneel on the ground and kowtow to me!” Lin Wan said viciously.
