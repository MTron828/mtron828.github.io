1753 The Despairing Yuan Xiu

As if his soul had left his body, two radiances flew out from the space between his eyebrows.

The light entered the mind of the mysterious figure, and he opened his eyes.

His eyes shot out two terrifying murderous auras, and the murderous aura was directed at Wen Wanchong and Qu Zhu!

“It’s broken!”

The two men’s expressions changed drastically. This aura was too terrifying, so terrifying that they could hardly move!

“You two must die here today.”

Yuan Xiu’s voice came from the mouth of the mysterious man!

It was obvious that Yuan Xiu had become one with the mysterious man!

After saying that, the mysterious man raised his hand. He borrowed the mysterious man’s strength and pressed his palm toward the two of them!

Qu Zhu and Wen Wanchong didn’t dare to delay and immediately activated their marks.

However, this palm was indestructible, and their spell techniques were all shattered in front of it!

No matter how hard they tried, they couldn’t move it at all!

“Boom!”

The palm landed solidly on the two of them, causing their bodies to almost collapse and their blood to dye the small world red!

Before they could react, the mysterious man had already attacked again.

He muttered, and a long sword actually hung above his head!

The long sword was extremely bright, as if it was going to cut the galaxy.

Countless internal qi lingered around, as if many dragons were coiling around it!

Wen Wanchong and Qu Zhu climbed up from the ground with great difficulty. They looked up at the sword, feeling extremely uneasy.

Just the action of raising their hands made their bodies start to tremble. If they were to slash down, they would probably split this small world into two!

“I’m finished.” Wen Wanchong’s face darkened.

At this moment, Qu Zhu seemed to have thought of something. He hurriedly took out the bracelet that Qin Yu had given him.

This bracelet originated from Xiao Yu. When Qin Yu first fought against Yuan Xiu, he used this bracelet!

If he could use this bracelet, he might still have a chance of survival!

Qu Zhu didn’t dare to think too much. He hurriedly released his aura, wanting to fuse with the bracelet.

But unfortunately, this bracelet was completely useless in Qu Zhu’s hands!

“It’s useless.” Qu Zhu coldly said.

Wen Wanchong gritted his teeth. He held the iron rod in his hand and said, “I can only fight it out with him!”

“It’s no use.” Qu Zhu took a deep breath.

“As long as this sword falls, you and I will definitely die together.” Qu Zhu said in a low voice.

He raised his head and stared at the long sword hanging in the sky. His face was extremely calm, as if he was ready to die.

“Ah!”

Wen Wanchong was not willing to give up. After a loud shout, he swung the iron rod in his hand at the mysterious man!

However, the mysterious man raised his hand and easily caught it!

Then, the mysterious man suddenly used his strength and Wen Wanchong was thrown out!

“In the end, I’m still going to die here.” Qu Zhu didn’t waste any more time. He closed his eyes, waiting for death to come.

“Boom, boom, boom...”

A terrifying sound entered the ears of the two. This world was trembling non-stop, as if it was about to collapse.

And that long sword was slashing down at an extremely fast speed, slashing towards the two of them!

The sword had yet to arrive, but Qu Zhu was already unable to withstand this pressure!

His body twisted into the shape of a shrimp, as if he was trying his best to resist.

Wen Wanchong’s situation was not any better. He roared and tried his best to resist the force, but he was still pressed to the ground.

The two of them closed their eyes at the same time. At this moment, they no longer had any hope.

“Boom, boom, boom...”

The long sword arrived as expected, and very quickly, it was hanging above their heads.

At this time, Qu Zhu and Wen Wanchong’s bodies were already suffocated by the pressure, and several of their bones were broken. They fell to the ground like a pool of mud, unable to get up.

Just as the long sword was about to land, it suddenly froze in mid-air!

“What?”

Qu Zhu and Wen Wanchong were stunned, and they looked up at the long sword.

The long sword was shaking violently, and the body of the mysterious man not far away was also shaking!

“What... What’s going on?” Wen Wanchong said in shock.

“It’s Jue Wu.” At this moment, Qu Zhu discovered something strange.

Outside this small world, Jue Wu’s small hand was emitting a purple light!

The ray of light, along with her small hand, entered Yuan Xiu’s true body and pierced through it!

“Jue Wu... How did she do it?” Qu Zhu couldn’t help but frown. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

At this moment, Wen Wanchong was sure of his thoughts.

Jue Wu must have obtained a portion of the power of the purple cloud pearl. Otherwise, she would not have been able to hurt Yuan Xiu!

“Ah!”

In this small world, the mysterious man was roaring!

His body was dissipating bit by bit, and the small world around him was also starting to collapse!

“You’re looking for death!” Yuan Xiu glared at Jue Wu and suddenly attacked. He swept his arm and instantly sent Jue Wu flying!

Jue Wu rolled a few times on the ground. She didn’t care about her injuries and hurriedly got up, shouting, “The two of you, hurry up and leave. Leave this to me!”

Both Wen Wanchong and Qu Zhu were stunned.

Leave it to Jue Wu? Wasn’t this the same as leaving Jue Wu here to wait for her death?

“No!” Wen Wanchong gritted his teeth and grabbed the iron rod again, ready to fight Yuan Xiu!

“Don’t worry, none of you will be able to leave this place,” Yuan Xiu replied coldly.

Yuan Xiu raised both his hands and the terrifying black radiance gathered once again. From his palms, it spread towards the sky!

In no time, the entire Divine Capital City was enveloped by this light!

Everyone was immersed in this world, unable to escape!

Yuan Xiu looked at them coldly and said, “You want to escape? Do you think you can?”

Jue Wu didn’t waste her breath like Yuan Xiu. With a shake of her feet, she raised her two small hands. Rays of purple radiance shot out like cannonballs!

This force was not to be underestimated, but it was impossible to kill Yuan Xiu!

“Hurry up!”

At this moment, Jue Wu suddenly ran to Wen Wanchong and Qu Zhu’s side.

She raised her palm and patted the back of the two.

A trace of gentle power entered the two’s bodies through Jue Wu’s palms.

Within moments, Wen Wanchong and Qu Zhu’s bodies were filled with energy.

They might not have recovered to their peak state, but they were almost there.

“It’s really amazing.” Qu Zhu couldn’t help but sigh.

“Now is not the time to talk about this. Let’s think of a way to escape.” Jue Wu coldly said.

Just as they were talking, Yuan Xiu appeared.

What shocked everyone was that his body actually filled the entire world. He was like a god looking down at the three of them!
