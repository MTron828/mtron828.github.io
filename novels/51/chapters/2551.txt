Chapter 2552 No More Human Race Zi Yang

The internal qi of the Primordial Sky Concealing Bead directly penetrated Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness, flashing out all the internal qi Qin Yu had absorbed previously.

Only then did Qin Yu’s messy thoughts in his sea of consciousness slowly come to a halt, and his entire body was covered in cold sweat. What technique was this?

Although his soul power was at its weakest state, it was enough to show how exaggerated this technique was for a mere trace of his internal qi to affect him to such an extent.

“Heart Origin Probing is a spell that Senior Brother Xuan Tian releases via his soul. This is a technique that the Three Purities Sect passed down for interrogating one’s inner heart. It was originally a method for cultivators to consolidate their dao mind continuously. At this moment, Senior Brother Xuan Tian wants to interrogate Senior Martial Uncle Zi Yang even though he’s dead. He wants to use the Heart Origin Probing to guide Martial Uncle Zi Yang to interrogate the origin of his inner heart and trace it back to the very origin.”

Li Yang said bitterly.

Everyone stood silently on the spot. At this moment, they had been surrounded.

The nine-winged monster race army was roaming in the void. At this moment, they suddenly appeared not far from them.

Five hundred soldiers attacked simultaneously. A halberd made a thunderous sound and pierced in their direction like a ghost. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, a sigh was heard.

The blood in Saint Zi Yang’s dark red eyes suddenly faded a little as his body began to tremble violently.

Suddenly, he raised his head and let out a wild roar.

After that, he pushed his palm out toward Qin Yu and the others.

As he pushed out his palm, Saint Zi Yang calmed down completely, and his eyes resumed their blackish-red color.

The demonic wing on the left was burning with a monstrous flame, and the entire sky seemed to be immersed in a sea of fire.

In an instant, Qin Yu felt the time had slowed down by thousands of times.

The dark creature surging toward them, the long halberds of the nine-winged monster race army, and the breeze flowing in the air seemed to be seen clearly.

A white light enveloped them and pushed them far away.

In the blink of an eye, they seemed to have penetrated through countless spaces, and Qin Yu’s consciousness completely disappeared.

In the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect, a tablet suddenly let out a soft sound and then cracked, completely turning into powder.

“Zi Yang…”

A Daoist sitting cross-legged among them trembled violently, and his face revealed a sorrowful expression.

“You’ve persisted for so long, and this is the limit of what you can do. No one will blame you. Go in peace. In the future, the Three Purities Sect will no longer have the name of Zi Yang.”

A magic sword appeared in the hands of the sect master of the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect.

He stabbed with his sword, and a stream of sword energy shot out like a star in the universe.

It then arrived in an instant and completely crushed the dark creatures that had followed the Misty Forest.

When Qin Yu woke up, it was already ten days later.

At this moment, his body was wrapped in thick bandages. The dense medicinal qi on it slowly seeped into his body through the pores on his body.

Nevertheless, he still felt tremendously weak at this moment.

The terrifying aftereffects of using the Judge’s Brush and that mysterious attack at the end seemed to have injured his origin.

Otherwise, with his Glass Holy Body’s terrifying recovery ability, he would not be so weak.

He slowly walked out of the room. What entered his eyes was a towering mountain range. Clouds and mist surrounded the mountain range, and it looked like a fairyland. This mountain range was steep and rugged.

He was currently on the highest peak of the mountain range, overlooking the entire sect.

At this moment, he could feel the sword intent permeating the entire sect. There were sword sculptures, murals, and decorations everywhere in the sect, creating an atmosphere of dense sword intent.

Even with a slight comprehension, he could feel the circulation of sword intent and the essence of the Way of the Sword.

“This should be the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect. Other than the sacred sect Kunlun, this should be the only sect possessing such sword intent.”

Qin Yu thought to himself.

“Qin Yu, you’re awake!”

A joyful voice came from his back. Qin Yu turned around and saw Shen Qian, Shen Rou, and the others.

“I’ve just regained consciousness. Can you tell me what happened subsequently?”

Qin Yu said with a bitter smile, feeling a little uneasy in his heart.

Although Xuan Xin and the others were quite nice, Qin Yu was not confident in facing one of the four sects.

His current state was really too bad, so bad that even a Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivator could control him.

Moreover, his Judge’s Brush had been exposed completely. If the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect schemed on him, he would be like a lamb waiting to be slaughtered.

“Senior Brother Xuan Tian’s last attack seemed to have temporarily restored a trace of Martial Uncle Zi Yang’s consciousness. He sent us out and seemed to have left some of his things for us. Qin Yu, can you sense anything in your sea of consciousness?”

Shen Qian asked curiously.

Qin Yu carefully sensed for a long time but did not detect the slightest abnormality.

“Perhaps the things Saint Zi Yang left behind can only be found in Daoist legacies. I didn’t sense anything.”

Qin Yu asked doubtfully.

“What a pity! These are all the inheritances of Martial Uncle Zi Yang. For example, Senior Brother Xuan Xin’s Daoist sword techniques, Zhang Xiang’s and Li Yang’s talisman techniques, and our magical divine power Dao techniques. Uncle Zi Yang has done all of these to the extreme. The memories he left behind are more than enough to be the cornerstone treasures of our three sects. Perhaps it’s just like what Brother Qin has said, the cultivation system is different, causing you to be unable to accept Martial Uncle Zi Yang’s inheritance.”

Shen Qian sighed and said.

“Brother Qin Yu, we were able to return this time because of you. We all owe you a life. If you have any needs in the future, the five of us will definitely do our best to repay you.”

A few of them looked at the white-haired Qin Yu, and Li Yang solemnly cupped his fists to thank him.

“While you were unconscious, Xuan Xin requested the sect master of the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect to heal you. However, regardless of life essence or the various pills and treasures that could increase the life force, they didn’t seem able to restore you to your previous peak state. When we return to the sect, we’ll definitely see Sect Master Martial Uncle and see if we can find a way to heal your injuries.”

Shen Qian said softly.

They could come out of it all because of Qin Yu.

If he had not used the Judge’s Brush, the corpses of the five would not have even been able to find, let alone the inheritance.

“Thank you in advance.”

Qin Yu said with a smile, his heart feeling warm.

In fact, saving them at that time was equivalent to saving himself. Otherwise, it would be unrealistic for him to leave at that time in his state.

However, many people in the world repaid kindness with hatred. At this moment, for them to express their stance, it made Qin Yu feel that rare sincerity.

“Where’s Xuan Xin? Why didn’t I see him?”

Qin Yu only saw the four of them. Could it be that Xuan Xin was also seriously injured and unconscious like him?
