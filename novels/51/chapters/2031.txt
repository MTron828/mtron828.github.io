Chapter 2032: The Gathering of Aristocratic Families

Si Liuhe was a legendary figure and a prestigious genius of the Si family.

He had displayed remarkable talents since he was young and quickly became the dazzling star of the Si family.

While growing and developing, he challenged numerous cultivators and had never been defeated.

Rumor had it that he once broke into a training Mystic Realm, fought ten of thousands of demons, and killed hundreds of people alone. It shocked the Holy Region tremendously.

!!

Subsequently, in the Si family’s expedition, he swept across the world and changed his name to Si Liuhe. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Si Liuhe’s arrival naturally made many people gasp.

Even though his status was not as high as that of the head of the Si family, the shock of his appearance was no less than that of the family head.

“Grandmaster.”

Everyone in the Si family bowed to him to show their respect.

Si Liuhe didn’t say anything. He looked straight and walked toward the center of the Chaos Grave.

Si Shiyue, the Holy Son of the Si family, was behind him.

As soon as Qin Yu saw Si Shiyue, he felt a strong battle intent.

He hurriedly suppressed this battle intent to avoid attracting trouble.

Fortunately, Si Si Shiyue, as Holy Son, had numerous people who wanted to fight him, so he did not notice Qin Yu.

“Si Liuhe…” Qin Yu silently recited this name and memorized it in his heart.

Soon, Si Liuhe walked to Yan Guyun’s side.

The two looked at each other and then casually greeted each other.

These two people were legendary existences in their respective families, so it was not strange that they would come together.

“Brother Yunfan, it’s been some time since we last met.” Si Shiyue took the initiative to greet Yan Yunfan.

“Mmm,” Yan Yunfan responded. ” It’s been a long time. Ever since I was stripped of my identity as the Holy Son, I no longer had the chance to meet you again. ”

These words were full of unwillingness and sarcasm. Yan Guyun could not help but glance at Yan Yunfan.

Si Shiyue stepped forward and said calmly, “As long as you are willing, we can meet at any time.”

Although Si Shiyue was talking about gathering, his body was bursting with battle intent!

Yan Yunfan had always been proud. Even though he had been stripped of his identity as the Holy Son, he had never thought he was inferior to anyone!

Therefore, Yan Yunfan immediately replied coldly, “Brother Si, if you are interested, I would like to learn from your experience.”

“I’ll look for you after settling the Chaos Grave,” Si Shiyue said coldly.

“That’s exactly what I’m looking for,” Yan Yunfan said coldly.

The conversation between the two immediately attracted the attention of numerous people, causing everyone to be tremendously surprised.

“These two people have just met, and they’re already so explosive…”

“Before Yan Ruoxue appeared, Yan Yunfan’s status was not any lower than Si Shiyue’s. They often argued about who was stronger back then. I guess they long had the idea of competing.”

“That’s right. Yan Yunfan is very combative in n nature. If Si Shiyue did not avoid him, the two could have determined who was stronger long ago.”

When Qin Yu heard this, a trace of surprise could not help but flash across his eyes.

Of course, he knew Yan Yunfan was a rare genius, but he never expected everyone to think so highly of him. He was even as good as Si Shiyue, who had a chaotic body!

“I’ve underestimated this Yan Yunfan,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Si Liuhe and Yan Guyun didn’t care about the conversation between the two juniors. They gazed into the distance, quietly watching the Chaos Grave.

“If the Si family obtains the chaotic body, Si Shiyue might become the number one Holy Son of the Holy Region,” Yan Guyun said calmly.

Si Liuhe did not refute. He looked into the distance and said indifferently, “Since I’ve already stepped out, you should understand that the Si family is determined to get it. My Si family has a good relationship with the Yan family, so I think Brother Guyun would lend me a hand.”

“That’s not necessarily the case. I’m sure Brother Liuhe knows who I am,” Yan Guyun said lightly.

Si Liuhe raised his eyebrows and changed the subject, “Brother Liuhe, why didn’t Saintess Yan come?”

“I never ask questions that I shouldn’t be asking.” Yan Guyun’s response was incredibly indifferent.

“I remember you thought highly of Yan Yunfan back then,” Si Liuhe said with a hint of a smile. “You even regarded him as your son. Am I right?”

Yan Guyun didn’t answer the question. He just looked into the distance silently. “Almost everyone knows that you, Yan Guyun, don’t listen to anyone’s orders except the head of the Yan family. However, when the Yan family asked you to teach Yan Ruoxue, you rejected them. I think it was because of Yan Yunfan, wasn’t it?” Si Liuhe continued.

Yan Guyun’s expression turned somewhat cold. He looked at Si Liuhe and said, “Si Liuhe, there are quite many rumors about you. They say that you used to be a genius who shocked the world. Speaking of which, I’m quite interested in your strength.”

When Si Liuhe heard this, he laughed heartily and said, “I understand why you like Yan Yunfan. It’s because both of you like to battle and are tremendously arrogant.”

Yan Guyun snorted coldly and said nothing.

Si Liuhe sighed, shaking his head. “When two tigers fight, one must be injured. Now is not the time for us to fight. At least for now, you and I are on the same side.”

“As for why you don’t want to help me, are you afraid that Yan Yunfan will lose to Si Shiyue?” Si Liuhe laughed.

Yan Guyun looked at Si Liuhe coldly and said, “I know you’re trying to provoke me. But I’m telling you, even if Si Shiyue has the secret of the chaotic body, so what? Yan Yunfan will never lose to Si Shiyue or anyone else.”

“I hope so. I believe they will fight soon.” Si Liuhe smiled faintly.

While the two were talking, the other aristocratic families arrived.

However, compared to the Si family and Yan family, the other aristocratic families were relatively much more low-key.

Although they had sent many powerful cultivators, they did not send any famous people who could shake the entire Holy Region.

The Gu family had Saintess Gu, while Yao Xi led the Yao family.

The people from the aristocratic families gathered together to discuss the matter of the Chaos Grave.

...

The nine aristocratic families had jointly mobilized the Formation Masters to open the Chaos Grave this time. Therefore, before opening the Big Grave, they had to discuss a complete distribution strategy. Otherwise, they could not open the Chaos Grave.

Qin Yu looked in their direction and muttered, “Five families still haven’t shown up. I think it will take some time to open the Chaos Grave.”

While saying that, streaks of terrifying light suddenly erupted around the Chaos Grave!

The light enveloped the entire Chaos Grave, enveloping everyone within.

Some cultivators tried to walk out of this barrier, but they found it like an iron wall they could not pass through at all..
