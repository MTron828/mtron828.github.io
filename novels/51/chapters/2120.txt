2121 Crushed

However, Si Liuhe’s expression did not change at all in the face of such an internal qi. He was still as calm as ever. He looked at Xuan Jizi and said indifferently, “How dare you be arrogant in front of me with such meager strength?”

Xuan Jizi’s eyes widened when he heard this. He could not believe his ears. He absolutely could not accept the other party could say such words so easily when he had used all his might.

Then Si Liuhe walked toward Xuan Jizi. He slowly reached out a hand, clenched it into a fist, and threw it at Xuan Jizi.

An incomparably powerful force erupted from his fist. This force was like a flood, and the sound of breaking through the air echoed in the air.

Right at this moment, the onlookers felt an indescribable pressure. It was the supreme pressure of a True Saint.

Xuan Jizi’s face turned pale. He felt as if his life was being taken away in this instant. He circulated all the elemental energy in his body frantically, trying to resist Si Liuhe’s punch.

However, at this instant, he found his power was like seawater, unable to withstand Si Liuhe’s mountain-like punch.

“Boom! ” With a loud bang, Si Liuhe’s punch broke through all of Xuan Jizi’s defenses. His body fell from the sky like a meteorite and directly crashed to the ground.

Si Liuhe stood in the air and looked down at Xuan Jizi. He said indifferently, “Xuan Jizi, is this all the power you have?”

Xuan Jizi crawled up from the ground in a disheveled manner. Looking up at Si Liuhe, his face was full of anger and unwillingness.

However, he knew that he was no match for Si Liuhe. The technique that he relied on seemed insignificant in front of Si Liuhe.

“Xuan Jizi, if you don’t burn your blood essence by force, I’m afraid you no longer have a chance.” Si Liuhe was still calm. He looked down at Xuan Jizi as if looking down at an ant.

Xuan Jizi gritted his teeth. He knew that Si Liuhe was right. He could not fight back if he did not recover to his peak condition!

“Alright, Si Liuhe, I’ll show you my true strength!” Xuan Jizi growled and started to burn his blood essence.

Suddenly, Xuan Jizi’s body seemed to turn into a burning fireball. Intense flames instantly rose, and their intensity and power surpassed the previous elemental energy fluctuations.

Xuan Jizi’s blood seemed to be burning. All the blood in his body was boiling. His internal qi rose again until it reached a new height.

The onlookers gasped again. They could not believe the scene in front of them. It was a powerful force they had never seen before.

Xuan Jizi’s internal qi had reached an unbelievable level. It made people tremble, and even the void was non-stop trembling!

He looked at Si Liuhe Liuhe coldly and said in a low voice, “You’ve forced me to do this. In that case, let’s fight with all our might.”

Si Liuhe’s face flashed with amusement upon hearing Xuan Jizi’s words.

Looking at Xuan Jizi, he said indifferently, “Is this your true power? Xuan Jizi, you’re just burning your own life. It’s not worth mentioning. It’s even ridiculous.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Xuan Jizi narrowed his eyes, sneered, and said, “I want to see how long you can be arrogant!”

“Heavenly Seal of Blood!” Xuan Jizi shouted, and a scarlet beam of light instantly burst out from his hand, shooting straight into the sky. There seemed to be countless blood-red runes rotating in the beam of light, and each rune contained astonishing power.

When the onlookers saw this scene, they all exclaimed. It was Xuan Jizi’s ultimate skill, the Heavenly Seal of Blood. Every time he used it, he would need to consume a large amount of blood essence. Now, he was actually using it recklessly.

At the same time, Si Liuhe was not idle either. Looking at Xuan Jizi in the sky calmly, his expression was normal as if he did not take Xuan Jizi seriously.

He slowly raised his hand as if he was holding something. After that, the elemental energy around his body began to fluctuate violently as powerful energy gathered in his hand.

The moment Xuan Jizi’s Heavenly Seal of Blood collided with Si Liuhe’s elemental energy, the surrounding world seemed to tremble. The earth began to shake violently as if the earth’s crust was cracking under this powerful force. The surrounding mountains collapsed, and the wind howled as if it was about to blow everything away.

The onlookers retreated in horror. They doubted whether they could survive this upheaval.

Xuan Jizi’s Heavenly Seal of Blood and Si Liuhe’s elemental energy collided in the air, like two stars colliding, bursting with endless light. The air was instantly burnt, and the surrounding scenery became blurry in this light.

However, Si Liuhe’s figure flickered in the light at this moment. His figure seemed to be erratic and appeared in front of Xuan Jizi in an instant. An elemental pearl shimmering with a cold light suspended on his right palm. The elemental pearl was suffused with a powerful might that seemed to be shaking the world.

He looked at Xuan Jizi indifferently and then punched out fiercely. The elemental pearl smashed directly at Xuan Jizi’s Heavenly Seal of Blood.

“Rumble!” With a loud bang, it was as if the world had shattered at this moment!

After a brief contact, the two began to collide!

The two were both True Saints. Needless to say, the collision was terrifying. The Holy Power spread within the void and shattered everything!

However, a moment later, a crisp crack sound came from the void. Under the impact of Si Liuhe’s elemental pearl, the Heavenly Seal of Blood shattered like thin ice!

Xuan Jizi’s body felt like it had been hit by a giant hammer. He was sent flying and fell from the sky like a kite with a broken string. Finally, he landed heavily on the ground!

Crushed!

This was the only thought on everyone’s mind!

Si Liuhe, also a True Saint, had almost crushed Xuan Jizi who burned his blood essence!

“Is this Si Liuhe’s strength… It’s too terrifying!”

“In the same cultivation realm, this person is probably invincible!”

“This is too scary. Xuan Jizi is like a baby in front of Si Liuhe!”

However, this was only the beginning.

Si Liuhe looked down from the sky at Xuan Jizi, who had landed on the ground. There was no emotional change in his expression. The elemental pearl in his hand flashed with a cold light again. This time, the cold light was even colder and more domineering.

There was no fluctuation in his eyes, nor was there any surprise. It was as if the way everything was supposed to be.
