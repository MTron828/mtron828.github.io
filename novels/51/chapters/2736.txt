What followed was the rage of the Saint Kingdom.

A huge thunderbolt suddenly fell and countless vortexes appeared in the void, tearing Qin Yu’s body in all directions.

Boom!

Two air pillars descended at an unbelievable speed, nailing Qin Yu to the ground.

It was as if following Heavenly Sin’s emotions, all the Orders were cooperating to kill Qin Yu.

Explode!

In that instant, Qin Yu’s body was like a silver sun.

At this moment, all the silver Saint Power hidden in his cells exploded.

All of the Saint Power surged into his heart. A dull and powerful sound was heard.

Silver holy energy instantly surged into Qin Yu’s limbs and bones.

Vast Qi of Milky Way!

He instantly turned into a silver sun, and the two void pillars that pierced through his body exploded.

This power forcefully squeezed out all the power of order that covered his body.

Ling Bo!

He stomped his foot and a silver stream of air arrived in front of Heavenly Sin.

Qin Yu clenched his fists and all his silver holy energy burst out. This explosive force caused the entire ground to sink thousands of meters deep.

The powder was sent flying into the high sky.

At this moment, the area within 10,000 feet seemed to have become an earthen yellow cage.

When the dust settled, Qin Yu only saw that Heavenly Sin was standing in front of him.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Qin Yu’s full-powered attack did not even injure him.

Qin Yu looked at his fist, which was bleeding profusely, in disbelief.

The scorching lava had already grabbed his feet. The air in the void turned into countless air swords.

At this moment, they were all pointing at Qin Yu from all directions. Qin Yu’s body was emitting a hazy power.

A large amount of damage was transferred to the dream by the power of the night. If not for this, the power of order would have crushed him into powder.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s body was already seeping out countless amounts of blood.

His entire body was covered in blood.

“Tell me! How did you obtain their memories?”

However, Qin Yu did not care about his injuries. He stared at Heavenly Sin in front of him like a madman.

All the silver holy energy was squeezed into his heart again.

Terrifying holy energy burst out from all the skeletons. Under Qin Yu’s control, the Saint Power entered his heart without leaving a single drop.

Qin Yu felt like his heart was being cut by a knife. The intense pain made his vision turn black.

Ordinary attacks were no longer effective against Heavenly Sin.

He could only fight to the death now and use his explosive power for a chance.

“Tell me!”

With an angry roar, Qin Yu’s heart suddenly burst out with all his holy energy.

A sonic boom that sounded like thunder from the nine heavens suddenly erupted under Qin Yu’s feet.

This was Qin Yu’s extreme speed in this place. Under this kind of speed, his vision seemed to have slowed down.

He saw him ten minutes ago. It seemed that he had entered another time tunnel at this extreme speed.

Die!

Qin Yu gave up all his defenses, and all the Night Qi in his body surged at his fingertips.

Wherever the finger passed, it was as if a hole had been pierced through the space.

Boundless gales poured out from the black hole.

Qin Yu’s finger stopped at Heavenly Sin’s chest. The Night Qi at his fingertip turned into a mirror.

The reflection in the mirror was the huge tombstone.

Qin Yu’s body slowly pierced through.

“God’s Space, explode!”

The power of the four-dimensional space erupted.

Qin Yu only felt that the power of his Finger Spear had merged on a timeline.

Boom!

The power of that finger shot out behind Heavenly Sin.

A mountain behind him was directly blasted into dust.

There was a deep ravine on the ground that stretched to the end.

A drop of blood appeared on Qin Yu’s fingernail.

Heavenly Sin was injured.

It was a drop of blood that was as red as the sun. The drop of blood suddenly floated up from his fingernail.

Then, it entered his chest. Immediately, the blood-colored glass Mark of Atonement began to change.

Suddenly, it turned into a devil-like face.

Qin Yu forced a smile and squatted down. This attack was already his limit.

At this moment, his Night Qi had been exhausted. Even the power left behind by Meng Jing had erupted with this attack. It had finally injured Heavenly Sin.

However, he was only injured.

“Are you so powerful?”

Qin Yu roared unwillingly.

Heavenly Sin put down the tombstone again.

Qin Yu seemed to be able to feel him staring at him with a teasing smile.

He was laughing at Qin Yu’s weakness and overestimation of his strength.

The word “bury” suddenly appeared on the tombstone.

As the fiery-red cinnabar slowly covered the entire ‘bury’ word.

Qin Yu only felt that he could not breathe. The world in front of him suddenly reversed.

Space locked his body and then everything pressed down on him.

“Bury!”

This was Heavenly Sin’s power. It was as if he was the high and mighty heavens.

Just one word made Qin Yu feel the terrifying gap between them.

“Hahaha! You’ve lost two rounds in a row, and you still have the face to continue attacking. Do you think I don’t exist?” A coarse voice suddenly sounded.

Qin Yu’s hand was already holding the dagger.

In front of Qin Yu, a Saint Crystal emitting a hazy light floated.

This was the top-grade Saint Crystal that Meng Jing had given him.

Qin Yu secretly cursed. The Saint Crystal in front of him exploded with an ocean of holy energy, which instantly entered the dagger without leaving a single drop.

At that moment, Qin Yu was a little stunned.

After absorbing the terrifying holy energy, the dagger no longer looked like a dagger.

A black shadow that was dozens of feet long appeared around Qin Yu. The dagger in his hand turned into a huge scythe.

The sharp aura emitted by the blade even made Qin Yu feel that it could cut through space.

The Dance of Death.

The black light of death instantly cut open in front of Qin Yu.

Sir Dagger controlled Qin Yu’s hand and waved it, splitting the space in front of him into two.

A flame blazed wherever the scythe passed.

Heavenly Sin’s power of the “bury” was instantly sliced apart.

As the scythe was swung, a huge tornado formed thousands of feet away.

This terrifying internal qi reached the clouds and even blasted a huge hole in the sky.

When all the smoke and dust dissipated, a stream of blood as hot as the sun appeared on the scythe.

Heavenly Sin’s figure had long disappeared.

In the next moment, Qin Yu sat on the futon again. The messy space returned to its previous appearance.

If it wasn’t for the fact that the scythe had shrunk and was held in Qin Yu’s hand, he would think that everything was a dream..
