Chapter 1700: Chapter 1700: Xiao Sheng’s thoughts 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“The death river will disappear very soon,”Xiao Sheng said to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s heart tightened and he hurriedly asked, “How much longer?”

“In less than a month, the death river will completely disappear,”Xiao Sheng said coldly.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Then have you… stepped into the reversion void stage?”

“No.”Xiao Sheng did not hide anything.

This made Qin Yu feel extremely uneasy.

One had to know that elementalists were not ordinary people at the reversion void stage. His strength definitely surpassed Zhao Jing’s.

Just because Xiao Sheng could defeat Zhao Jing did not mean that he could defeat elementalists.

“Even if I can’t defeat an elementalist, I can at least exchange one for one with him,”Xiao Sheng suddenly said as if he had read Qin Yu’s mind.

Qin Yu opened his mouth, feeling a little uncomfortable.

With Xiao Sheng’s talent, his future was limitless.

It would be a pity if he were to exchange for one just like that. That was not what Qin Yu wanted to see.

Although an elementalist was strong, his cultivation method was destined to have a limited future. There was no need for Xiao Sheng to exchange for one with him.

“I finally understand why so many people did not want me to take the risk back then.”Qin Yu sighed slightly.

Then, he tried to ask, “Have you ever thought of trying to mobilize other people at the reversion void stage?”

Xiao Sheng scoffed at this.

He sneered and said, “I’ve never thought of pinning my hopes on others.”

Seeing this, Qin Yu didn’t say anything more.

“Just wait. A month’s time isn’t considered long,”Xiao Sheng said with a smile.

These words were true. For cultivators, a month was too short. Compared to a long life, it was almost negligible.

The lifespan of a cultivator at the reversion void stage was as long as two thousand years, and a mighty figure had a lifespan of more than one thousand years.

“I understand.”Qin Yu nodded and agreed. At the moment, there was indeed no other way.

After leaving the Heavenly Cloud sect, Qin Yu planned to go to wind bamboo mountain because qu Zhu had also stepped into the reversion void stage not long ago.

However, he was not like Xiao Hai Jue Wu. No one knew if he would make a move.

They arrived at the wind bamboo mountain.

This place had already recovered its original appearance. It was unknown whether it was because Qu Zhu had stepped into the reversion void stage, or because of the great changes in the world, the scenery of the wind bamboo mountain had become even more beautiful.

Qu Zhu seemed to have sensed Qin Yu’s arrival a long time ago. He placed some food and wine in the bamboo forest and waited for Qin Yu.

When Qin Yu walked into the bamboo forest, qu Zhu raised his hand and poured a glass of wine for Qin Yu.

Qin Yu slowly walked to Qu Zhu and sat down.

He went straight to the point and said, “The death river will disappear in a month.”

“I know,”qu Zhu said.

“Xiao Sheng hasn’t stepped into the reversion void stage. He might not be able to do so in the remaining month,”Qin Yu continued.

Qu Zhu sneered and asked, “So?”

“So… he might not be a match for an elementalist,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Qu Zhu remained silent as he waited for Qin Yu to continue.

Qin Yu could only continue, “Big Brother Qu Zhu, with your strength, I believe that you can at least defeat an elementalist.”

“You want me to make a move?”Qu Zhu asked.

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude and said, “I can’t think of anyone else besides you.”

Qu Zhu emptied the wine in his wine cup and said, “So many people have entered the reversion void stage during this period of time. Why Can’t Saint Xiao Do It?”

Qin Yu was stunned and immediately felt a little surprised.

Qu Zhu continued, “Saint Xiao is no weaker than anyone else in his life. Regardless of talent or state of mind, he is far superior to others. How could he not be able to enter the reversion void stage after such a long time?”

Qin Yu frowned.

Qu Zhu was right. With Xiao Sheng’s ability, it was impossible for him to step into the reversion void stage with such difficulty.

It was not because he was unable to step into the reversion void stage when the world was about to reach its end.

However, the world had changed greatly. It seemed that he could step into the reversion void stage at any time.

“I understand.”Qin Yu suddenly understood something.

He looked at Qu Zhu in surprise and said, “Xiao Sheng wants to use the half-step into the reversion void stage to fight against an elementalist? He wants to test his limits?”

“That’s right.”Qu Zhu nodded.

“But isn’t the risk too great? The opponent is an elementalist after all. He is the master of the northern lands who has been sleeping for many years.”Qin Yu frowned.

Qu Zhu smiled and said, “Everyone has their own dao technique. Some people are born not to take risks and not to be radical. For example, I am.”

“And some people are born to put themselves on the edge of danger or even death. They can feel the true meaning of life from it. As the saying goes, if you don’t break, you can’t build.”

“Xiao Sheng is the latter. This is the DAO technique he cultivates. Why do you and I need to worry about it?”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and was immediately speechless.

“This guy is really crazy,”Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

Qu zhu sighed and said, “Yes, he and Xiao Hai are like two extremes.”

At this point, qu Zhu changed the topic and continued, “And you seem to be the moderator between the two of them.”

Qin Yu did not say anything. He did not deny this.

“Why think so much? You should eat, drink, and take things one step at a time.”Qu Zhu patted Qin Yu’s shoulder.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “I understand.”

After leaving Qu Zhu’s place, Qin Yu planned to imitate Xiao Sheng and prepare to travel around the world.

However, just as he walked out of wind bamboo mountain, an ice-cold internal Qi approached him.

This internal Qi was extremely familiar. It came from the northern lands!

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold. A killing intent immediately burst forth from his body as he quietly waited for the other party’s arrival. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

In a short while, a person dressed in a black robe arrived in front of Qin Yu.

“You still dare to come to the southern state?”Qin Yu was the first to speak as he asked coldly.

The other party said with a faint smile, “Sir, there’s no need to worry. I’m here under the orders of the godly monarch to issue a challenge to you.”

“Challenge?”Qin Yu frowned slightly.

The other party nodded slightly and said, “That’s right. The eternal limit godly monarch said that in a month’s time, the northern border will not rest until one of us is dead.”

“Eternal limit?”Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and could not help but sneer.

This piece of SH * t really did not give up on his evil intentions.

“By the way, I’ll remind you that the eternal limit godly monarch has already stepped into the reversion void stage,”the black-robed man said indifferently.

Qin Yu was not surprised. With Yongji’s talent, stepping into the reversion void stage was definitely not a difficult matter.

“Go back and tell Yongji that I will wait for him in a month,”said Qin Yu coldly.

The black-robed man said with a faint smile, “In that case, you have accepted the challenge?”

“What do you think?”Said Qin Yu with a cold smile.

The black-robed man said with a smile, “Alright. I hope that in a month, Mr. Qin will be able to abide by the challenge.”

After saying this, the black-robed man turned around and left.

After he left, Qin Yu could not help but frown.

He sighed slightly.

He originally thought that this war would not have much to do with him, but now it seemed that it was still at the center of the storm.

“Looks like we can’t waste any more time.”Qin Yu sighed.
