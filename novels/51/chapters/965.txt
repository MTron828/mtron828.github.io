Chapter 966: Chapter 966, training the spiritual sense

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, everyone could not help but feel a little surprised. At the same time, they also felt a trace of pressure.

It was extremely difficult to step into the martial saint realm. In the current era, there was not a single young person who had stepped into the martial saint realm.

“Alright, I Won’t talk to you guys anymore. I’m going down the mountain.”Qin Yu waved his hand.

Immediately after, Qin Yu turned around and left the nine pinnacles mountain.

After going down the mountain, Qin Yu returned to Jingdu once again.

He wore a set of sportswear and a hat on his head. He had also restrained his internal Qi to the extreme.

“If this matter was really done by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, then this is probably just the beginning,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

However, with Qin Yu’s current ability, he had no time to care about anything else.

Qin Yu might still have the strength to fight against a martial saint. However, once a second martial saint appeared, Qin Yu would most likely only have the qualifications to run away.

“Pu!”

At this moment, Qin Yu spat out another mouthful of blood from his mouth, and his face instantly turned a few shades paler.

“This won’t do... If this continues, I’m afraid my golden core will be crippled sooner or later.”Qin Yu’s face could not help but be filled with worry.

If he could not resolve the dao injury of his golden core, then it was probably impossible for him to step into the martial saint realm.

Qin Yu wiped the blood at the corner of his mouth and temporarily threw this matter to the back of his mind.

For the entire day, Qin Yu did not leave Jingdu.

He hid in the dark and secretly observed the movements of the various great mystery realms.

Some of the disciples in this mystery realm had already begun to attempt to become martial saints, but most of them were flaunting their might in the martial arts academy.

At night.

Qin Yu found a place to temporarily stay.

He threw a few spiritual stones into the spatial divine artifact and then extended a thread of spiritual sense into the spatial divine artifact.

After stepping into the spatial artifact, the few spirit stones disappeared without a trace.

“This old thing doesn’t think it’s shabby,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He quickly walked to the vicinity of the Abyss and sat down. Then, he said with a strange tone, “He’s already so old, and he’s still a thief. He’s really F * cking Shameless.”

A sound came from the bottom of the abyss. “Little Bastard, who are you talking about?”

Qin Yu snorted, “Who knows? I don’t know which shameless person ate my spirit stones.”

“It’s just a few spirit stones, yet you want to be so weird. If this was a thousand years ago, I wouldn’t want it even if you gave it to me.”The light snorted coldly.

Qin Yu mocked, “Is that so? I still have more than a thousand spirit stones here. I wanted to give it to you, but if that’s the case, then forget it.”

After he finished speaking, Qin Yu turned around and was about to leave.

At this moment, there was another movement from the bottom of the abyss. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“If you give me all these spiritual stones, I might be able to try to escape from this abyss,”the other party said.

Qin Yu stopped in his tracks.

He turned around and was silent for a moment. Then, he asked, “Are you serious?”

“More or less. However, if you want to recover to Your Peak, I’m afraid you’ll need tens of thousands of spiritual stones,”he continued to say.

Qin Yu touched his chin and said, “What kind of realm can those thousand spiritual stones allow you to recover to? A martial marquis? Or a martial saint?”

“It shouldn’t be a problem for you to recover to the peak of the Martial Saint Realm.”He said.

When he said this, he paused for a moment and said somewhat seductively, “If I get out of this abyss, I can lend you my power temporarily.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything for a long time.

This old thing was obviously not as gullible as the Earth Fiend Valley’s patriarch back then.

If he wanted to buy his power for free, it was probably not that simple.

I have to think of a way to restrain him, Qin Yu thought to himself.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu immediately left this spatial god tool.

After returning to his original body, Qin Yu took out a few more spirit stones and threw them into the spatial god tool.

After doing all this, Qin Yu once again came to the vicinity of the abyss.

“How was it? Did you enjoy your meal?”Qin Yu asked with a smile.

“What the F * ck are you feeding at the zoo? Do you think I’m a Monkey?”The voice from below the Abyss couldn’t help but contain some anger.

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “Just say whether you want it or not. If you don’t, then forget it.”

The other party sneered and said, “Kid, do you really think I care about a few mere spirit stones? I’ve lived for so many years, what kind of treasure haven’t I seen?”

“If you treat me like a monkey again, I’ll tear you apart!”His voice contained a cold killing intent.

Qin Yu mocked, “Let’s talk about it after you can come up.”

“Hehe, with your weak spiritual sense, I can raise my hand and turn you into ashes... to Oblivion! !”

With that last word, he suddenly increased the volume of his voice!

That terrifying vibration directly made Qin Yu’s spiritual sense dim a few times!

And Qin Yu’s main body suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood!

This instantly caused Qin Yu’s expression to change greatly!

He didn’t expect that a furious roar would be able to injure his spiritual sense!

“Such a weak spiritual sense, yet you dare to strut around in front of me?”He sneered.

Qin Yu forcefully endured the pain brought by the spiritual sense and once again walked to the vicinity of the abyss.

He pondered for a moment, then sat on the ground and said, “Your realm is higher than mine, so your spiritual sense is naturally stronger than mine. What’s there to brag about?”

“Even if my realm is weaker than yours, my spiritual sense is still stronger than yours,”he mocked.

Qin Yu rubbed his chin and said tentatively, “In that case, can the power of spiritual sense be trained?”

“Isn’t that nonsense?”The other party snorted coldly.

Qin Yu rubbed his chin and said somewhat deliberately, “So what if the power of spiritual sense is strong? It’s useless. As long as the realm is strong enough, it’s enough.”

“Hehe.”The bottom of the Abyss couldn’t help but laugh.

“People like you, who don’t have much experience, will naturally think so.”

“If your spiritual sense is strong enough, it will be able to surprise you! If you meet someone with a strong spiritual sense, I’m afraid you won’t even know how you died!”

Hearing this, Qin Yu suddenly understood.

He immediately nodded and said, “Thank you. When my spiritual sense is strong enough, I’ll look for You Again!”

After saying this, Qin Yu directly left the spatial artifact.

After returning to his original body, Qin Yu could still feel the damage that the furious roar had caused to his divine sense.

He rubbed his eyes, feeling that his vision had turned black, and his head was dizzy.

“Damn, it seems like it’s not that easy to ask for his help,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“I have to think of a way to tame him,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

It would probably be a long process, but Qin Yu was not in a hurry. After all, the spatial artifact was in his hands.

Then, Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly and tried to train his spiritual sense.

In his mind, a little golden man was sitting cross-legged.

This little golden man was Qin Yu’s spiritual sense.

He tried to force his spiritual sense out of his glabella, and then tried to materialize his spiritual sense to take the spirit stone in front of him.

Unfortunately, Qin Yu’s spiritual sense was too weak. He couldn’t even pick up a single piece of spiritual sense.

“It’s said that if the spiritual sense is strong enough, it can move the body. But now, I can’t even pick up a single spirit stone.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

Then, Qin Yu sent his spiritual sense into the spatial divine tool and tried to move the herbs in it.

Throughout the whole night, Qin Yu’s spiritual sense had improved so much that it was almost negligible.

“It seems that I can’t rely on this method anymore,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

At this moment, Qin Yu couldn’t help but look at the abyss.

His eyes slightly throbbed, as if he was struggling with something.

“Damn it, I don’t care anymore!”Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He looked at the Abyss and suddenly jumped down.
