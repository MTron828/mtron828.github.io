Chapter 442: Fighting He Teng! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“The power of the Divine Dragon is a true sacred object.” He Teng’s tone began to become a little unnatural.

The greed in his voice was unconcealed.

Qin Yu frowned and asked, “What do you want to say?”

He Teng glanced at Qin Yu and Fang Yue and sneered. “Do you know why I invited Fang Yue?”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “How would I know?”

He Teng laughed and said, “Because if I want to get the Dragon Spirit, I have to use Spirit Pills to summon the Dragon Spirit!”

“But I never thought that you had also swallowed Spirit Pills!”

“The heavens are really helping me!”

He Teng laughed crazily, and his demeanor was no longer elegant!

Qin Yu subconsciously pulled Fang Yue to his side, and then said coldly, “What do you want to do?”

He Teng narrowed his eyes and said, “I’ll use the two of you to summon the Dragon Spirit! This is the reason why you guys came here!”

The murderous internal qi on He Teng’s body became more and more intense, and his eyes began to turn scarlet!

After sensing the murderous internal qi on his body, Qin Yu’s internal qi also began to rise rapidly.

“Do you think that you alone are a match for the two of us?” Qin Yu sneered.

“Hahaha, let’s not talk about whether I can kill the two of you first. The key is... I don’t need to do anything at all!” He Teng said coldly.

As soon as he said that, He Teng started to mumble, as if he was chanting some kind of spell.

“Ah!”

As He Teng’s mouth moved, Fang Yue suddenly let out a soft cry, and her body immediately went limp.

She fell to the ground and her body kept twitching. Streams of pink internal qi floated out from her dantian.

“Fang Yue!” Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed! Then, he clenched his fist and threw a punch at He Teng!

He Teng’s feet shook and he hurriedly dodged to the side.

“What’s going on? Why isn’t this spell working on him?” He Teng frowned.

Qin Yu looked at He Teng coldly and shouted, “I knew you didn’t have good intentions. I didn’t expect you to be so impatient as soon as we arrived at Brightheart Island.”

He Teng ignored Qin Yu. He opened his mouth slightly and began to chant the spell again.

Unfortunately, Qin Yu was not affected at all! Instead, he clenched his fist and rushed over!

“D*mn, could it be that this kid didn’t swallow the Spirit Pill at all?” He Teng couldn’t help but curse. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Kill him first. Don’t let him ruin our plans.” That hoarse voice sounded in He Teng’s mind.

He Teng nodded. He dodged Qin Yu’s punch and then said coldly, “Since the incantation is useless against you, then you have lost your value... Go to h*ll!”

As he spoke, the internal qi on He Teng’s body suddenly soared!

This internal qi was rapidly rising. In a short period of time, it had even surpassed the peak of the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm. It was only a hair’s breadth away from the half-step Martial Marquis Realm!

“As expected of the number one among the younger generation of the Central Plains.” Qin Yu sneered.

“Let me see what you, the number one person, have up your sleeve!”

Qin Yu’s entire body burst out with golden light. His fist was like the scorching sun as it ruthlessly smashed toward He Teng!

He Teng didn’t dare to be negligent. He opened his mouth slightly, and a ray of black gas that was like a jujube core shot towards Qin Yu!

“Clang!”

The black gas and Qin Yu’s fist collided together. In an instant, the force on Qin Yu’s fist vanished into thin air!

“What technique is this?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Before he could regain his senses, He Teng had already stepped forward!

“Azure Flame Dragon Axe!”

He Teng roared, and an icy blue axe immediately came crushing towards Qin Yu!

“Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist!”

Qin Yu roared, and golden light rose up again to face this icy blue light head-on!

“Boom!”

At the instant of contact, that icy blue light suddenly exploded!

Immediately after, these rays of light stuck onto Qin Yu’s body!

“Kacha!”

The moment the rays of light attached themselves to Qin Yu’s body, they instantly tightened. Qin Yu’s body was rapidly frozen, and in the blink of an eye, he had actually turned into an ice sculpture!

Such a scene naturally attracted the attention of countless people.

“What are you martial artists doing?! Who let you fight?” The big-bellied man cursed.

He Teng glanced at him, and then slapped him.

The big-bellied man was immediately sent flying and spat out a mouthful of blood.

“Meng Wuxiong, you can make a move now!” He Teng said coldly.

As soon as he said that, a strong figure descended.

He was none other than the king of Dongchuan, Meng Wuxiong!

Meng Wuxiong sized up the group of rich men, then rubbed his fists and said, “Sorry, you guys are now being held hostage.”

“Wh... what? Mr. Meng, you must be joking...” The group of tycoons immediately panicked.

“This is a lawful society... Don’t mess around!”

Meng Wuxiong grinned and sneered. He suddenly waved his large palm and smashed a head into pieces.

Seeing the corpses on the ground, the group of tycoons instantly turned pale.

“All of you kneel, on the ground!” Meng Wuxiong roared angrily.

Facing death, the rich men no longer acted arrogant.

All of them knelt on the ground while trembling silently.

Then, Meng Wuxiong walked to He Teng’s side and frowned. “He Teng, these people are just a bunch of trash. Why don’t we kill them all and throw them into the sea?”

He Teng glanced at Meng Wuxiong and said coldly, “They are useful to me.”

Meng Wuxiong didn’t say anything more.

“Kill that kid so that he won’t ruin my plans.” He Teng pointed at Qin Yu, who had been frozen into an ice sculpture.

Meng Wuxiong rubbed his fist and said, “Okay, I got it.”

Then, Meng Wuxiong walked toward Qin Yu.

“I heard that you are the king of Chuzhou. I am the king of Dongchuan. I really want to see what you are capable of.” Meng Wuxiong said indifferently.

“But unfortunately, you no longer have the chance.” A trace of viciousness flashed across Meng Wuxiong’s face.

In the next second, he clenched his fist and ruthlessly smashed it at Qin Yu!

“Crack!”

However, at this moment, a crack suddenly appeared on the ice sculpture!

“Boom!”

Immediately after, the ice sculpture exploded!

Golden light shot in all directions from Qin Yu. Even his hair was shining with a brilliant golden hue!

“If you want to fight, I can satisfy you,” Qin Yu said coldly as he looked at Meng Wuxiong.

He Teng’s expression couldn’t help but change.

“He actually broke it?” He Teng said with a frown.

“Meng Wuxiong, kill him.”
