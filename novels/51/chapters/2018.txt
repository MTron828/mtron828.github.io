2019 The Endless Killing Formation

The Endless Killing Formation

After the negotiation with the lady boss, Qin Yu returned to his accommodation.

For the entire night, Qin Yu was thinking about the arrangement of the Endless Killing Formation.

This kind of formation was tremendously brutal. It was usually used as a mountain guarding formation or emerged in Big Graves.

Now Qin Yu wanted to use this killing formation to kill Elder Si. It was indeed quite brutal.

“I can’t drag innocent people into it,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Once he activated the Endless Killing Formation, all the living beings in the formation would be slaughtered. Unless the formation was broken, it would never stop.

Therefore, Qin Yu had to find a quiet and uninhabited area to avoid harming innocent people.

“I have to think of a way to trick Elder Si out,” Qin Yu thought to himself. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Qin Yu definitely couldn’t do it in person because he had to control the formation. Thus he had to find someone he could trust.

However, in Divine Fortuity City, Qin Yu didn’t know many people, not to mention anyone he could trust.

Qin Yu rubbed his chin and muttered, “Since I don’t have any acquaintances, I can only trick Elder Si into leaving the city through profit.”

Qin Yu did not sleep the entire night. After a whole night of thinking, Qin Yu finally thought of a countermeasure.

As all the aristocratic families were attracted by the Chaos Grave now, they had given up their pursuit of Qin Yu.

However, to Elder Si, Qin Yu was still a temptation to him. He would definitely not miss it if there was an opportunity.

“There’s a way.” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and could not help but sneer.

After he set up the killing formation, he could deliberately expose his location to attract Elder Si.

“It’s settled now.” Qin Yu got up and left his accommodation, planning to bring back the 108 magical artifacts.

After that, Qin Yu arrived at the lady boss’s shop at the agreed time.

Seeing Qin Yu, the lady boss smiled and took out a storage bag. “I’ve prepared the magical artifacts you wanted. I spent quite a bit of effort to gather these magical artifacts.”

Qin Yu smiled but did not say anything. He could not help but think to himself, “I spent a lot of money!”

Nevertheless, Qin Yu did not say much. He only checked the magical artifacts and left after confirming they were in order.

Qin Yu took his magical artifacts and left Divine Fortuity City.

The area around Divine Fortuity City was barren, so it was not difficult to find a quiet place.

Soon, Qin Yu found a somewhat hidden valley in this barren land.

On this barren land, there was almost no vegetation. There were only some scattered dead tree branches, making people feel desolate.

There was no sunlight in the valley, only a faint light shining through the broken branches and scattered on the ground, reflecting a gloomy scenery.

Gloomy internal qi permeated the air and made people shudder.

“Looks like this place was once a graveyard,” Qin Yu could not help but think to himself when he sensed the strange internal qi that permeated the air.

Of course, to Qin Yu, this was naturally the best place to set up an Endless Killing Formation.

Qin Yu had long memorized the method to set up the Endless Killing Formation. Perhaps it was because he had inherited it from his father, so Qin Yu was tremendously talented in formation.

“As long as the killing formation arrangement is completed, it won’t be difficult to kill Elder Si,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

After that, Qin Yu did not dare to waste time. After all, no one knew when Elder Si would leave, so he had to set up the killing formation as soon as possible.

He first placed the magical artifacts on the ground one by one, then began to circulate his spiritual power to connect the connection points between the magical artifacts.

These connection points had formed in Qin Yu’s mind. He had to draw them out accurately, or the entire formation would fail.

The Endless Killing Formation that Qin Yu had meticulously designed was a mysterious killing formation. The magical artifacts in the formation could cooperate with each other and continuously absorb the internal qi in it. In the end, they would transform it into energy and store it in the formation, waiting for Qin Yu to activate it.

Qin Yu arranged the magical artifacts into an Eight Trigrams Formation and began to leave his consciousness mark in the formation.

He constantly circulated his spiritual power and fused his mental strength with the formation.

During this process, Qin Yu had to remain vigilant at all times and not let anyone interfere with his formation arrangement.

Time passed by. After two full days, Qin Yu finally completed the arrangement of the entire formation.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s physical and mental strength had already been exhausted, but he did not care. Instead, he let out a long breath.

“Fortunately, the arrangement of this killing formation is still considered smooth.” Qin Yu wiped the sweat off her forehead somewhat weakly.

Looking at the work he had completed perfectly, Qin Yu was quite satisfied.

Subsequently, Qin Yu was only required to begin guiding the spiritual energy in the formation and dripping the blood essence on the formation cores, the formation would be completely activated.

Of course, Qin Yu urgently needed rest for now. After covering up the formation, he returned to Divine Fortuity City.

After returning to Divine Fortuity City, Qin Yu did not immediately look for Elder Si. Instead, he found an inn to rest for a night.

He swallowed all the qi-replenishing pills in his hand to restore his internal qi and physical strength as soon as possible.

Under the effect of the qi-replenishing pills, Qin Yu’s strength recovered by more than half the following day.

He tried clenching his fist and felt the surging power in his body. Then, a trace of coldness burst out from his eyes.

“It’s almost ready.” Qin Yu took a deep breath. “Elder Si, it’s time for you to pay the price for your actions! ”

After that, Qin Yu began to spread the news according to his plan.

Divine Fortuity City wasn’t considered big, so the news naturally spread very quickly. In a short while, it had circulated in more than half of Divine Fortuity City.

“Did you guys hear the news? Qin Yu actually came to Divine Fortuity City!”

“What? Qin Yu? The Qin Yu who kidnapped the third princess?”

...

“Does he also want to go to the Chaos Grave?”

“You’re talking nonsense! Qin Yu has a chaotic body. How can he resist the temptation of the Chaos Grave?”

“Obviously, he came to Divine Fortuity City to look for a magical artifact that could conceal internal qi. It’s a good idea, but it’s a pity that he has exposed himself.”

“Rumor has it that he’s currently in a valley 30 stars away from Divine Fortuity City!”

Just as Qin Yu had guessed, the news quickly spread. It did not take long for the news to get to Elder Si’s ears.

In a courtyard deep in Divine Fortuity City, Elder Si listened to the report of the person beside him, and a hint of coldness appeared on his face.

“This Qin Yu has indeed come to Divine Fortuity City,” Elder Si said sinisterly.

“Third Elder, I’ve already locked onto Qin Yu’s location.”

Elder Si slowly stood up and said with a vicious expression, “Because of this Qin Yu, I was almost banished from the Si family! I’m not even qualified to participate in this Chaos Grave! This time, I must kill him personally!”
