Chapter 1501: Chapter 1501, the used di zun 1

Yin Palace was an extremely special place.

Even though this place had become a wasteland, it was actually filled with mysteries.

The last time he came here to fight Hua Zi, Qin Yu had used the desolate God’s eye to sense the abnormality.

There seemed to be two dragon vein buried under Yin Palace.

The two dragon vein could draw on the Qi of Heaven and earth and use it for his own use.

Qin Yu planned to head to the Yin Palace and set up a formation there. He would use the dragon vein to draw upon the Qi of heaven and earth to prevent any accidents from happening.

He rushed all the way to the Yin Palace. At this moment, the Yin Palace was extremely quiet and remote.

Not to mention humans, not even a blade of grass could be seen.

Qin Yu stood there and activated his desolate divine eye, looking at more than half of the Yin Palace.

There were indeed two dragon vein buried under the Yin Palace.

The dragon vein was grayish-black in color, like a divine dragon formed from Black Fog.

“Dragon vein of Yin,”Qin Yu exclaimed.

The desolate God’s eye’s effect was indeed beyond imagination. Other than sensing the enemy hiding in the dark, he had also discovered such an opportunity in Yin Palace.

......

With the help of the two dragon vein of Yin, Qin Yu could fight First Elder and company!

He didn’t waste any more time and began to set up the formation.

This was a long process, and with Qin Yu’s skills, it would take at least a week.

On the other side, Di Zun had already rushed back to the Heavenly Cloud sect and conveyed Qin Yu’s intentions to the first elder.

The first elder appeared amiable on the surface, but he was sneering in his heart.

“Little Bastard, you are still too young after all.”The first elder sneered in his heart.

Of course, he was not in a hurry to go to Yin Palace. Instead, he planned to leave in a few days to avoid being discovered by Qin Yu.

“First Elder, please make sure to discuss this matter.”Di Zun said with a hint of worry.

First Elder patted Di Zun’s shoulder and said with a smile, “Don’t worry. I will think of a way to completely resolve the conflict.”

The so-called completely resolve was naturally to resolve Qin Yu.

Since he was already dead, the conflict naturally did not exist.

Time flew by. In the blink of an eye, several days had passed.

The entire southern province looked calm and peaceful, but in fact, it was surging with undercurrents.

A large group of people from the northern lands had already sneaked into the southern province, as if they were preparing to do something big.

Yin Palace.

A young man was carving something on the ground.

“Hu.”Qin Yu raised his head and wiped the sweat from his forehead.

He stared at the huge yin palace and said in a low voice, “It’s really not an easy task to activate the dragon vein of Yin.”

Even though Qin Yu had the Guardian’s inheritance, it was still extremely difficult for him to set up.

The unfamiliar technique made him almost fail time and time again.

This made Qin Yu even more nervous. Every step he took was very careful, as if he was treading on thin ice.

In the blink of an eye, seven days had passed.

On this day, Qin Yu stood above Yin Palace and lowered his head to stare at the ground.

“I’ve finally succeeded,”Qin Yu thought to himself. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

As for whether the dragon vein of Yin would succeed or not, Qin Yu didn’t have any confidence in himself.

After thinking about it, he shot towards a certain direction. It was unknown what he was busy with.

Just as Qin Yu finished setting up, a young man suddenly appeared behind Qin Yu.

Qin Yu hurriedly turned around and looked at the young man in front of him with vigilance.

The Young Man’s face was cold and stern, without any good emotions.

He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “My foster father invites you to Yong Ji City for a chat.”

“Yong Ji City?”Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly. “Why is he looking for me?”

The young man said, “I don’t know. My Foster Father asked you to go there to reminisce about old times.”

Qin Yu laughed and said, “I’ve known him for less than ten days. How can I reminisce about old times? Could it be that Mister Yongji wants to avenge his beloved son?”

The young man said coldly, “Of course not. My master would never be angry over a fight between juniors.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Go back and tell Mister Yongji that I don’t have time. If he wants to find me for something, come to Yin Palace. I’ll wait for him here.”

The young man frowned slightly, and then said coldly, “Qin Yu, you really don’t know what’s good for you. My Foster Father has offered you an olive branch many times, but you have repeatedly refused!”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer and say, “Do you want to be the second hua zi?”

The young man’s face slightly changed. He lightly snorted and then cupped his fists and said, “Goodbye!”

After saying this, he turned around and left without turning back.

Looking at his back, Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed slightly.

This Yongji definitely didn’t have anything good to hold back.

But it didn’t matter. If he made a move, then he would take care of him along the way.

...

There were only two days left before the agreed time. The eighteen gods of the Heavenly Cloud sect had already arrived nearby.

The celestial that had been injured by Qin Yu previously had already recovered. They were hiding in the dark, waiting for the first Elder’s orders.

Qin Yu sat cross-legged with his eyes slightly closed, waiting for their arrival.

That day.

Di Zun was the first to arrive. He ran all the way to Qin Yu and said excitedly, “Master!”

Qin Yu slowly opened his eyes and said, “Where is the first elder?”

“He will be here soon!”Di zun said, “Master, we must be friendly during this negotiation. Don’t make a move.”

Qin Yu sneered, “Don’t worry. As long as he comes to talk to me sincerely, I can talk to him.”

With Qin Yu’s words, Di Zun was relieved.

After another ten minutes, the first elder walked over from not far away.

He was still wearing a white robe and had a long beard. There was an indescribable pride on his face.

“First Elder!”Di Zun waved at the first elder.

The first elder ignored Di Zun. He looked at Qin Yu and said indifferently, “Qin Yu, long time no see.”

Qin Yu stood up from the ground. He patted the soil on his butt and sneered, “Indeed, long time no see. Just say what you want to say.”

First elder laughed out loud, “Say what? What do you think I can say?”

Then, first elder looked at di zun and shouted, “Di Zun, you did well! You successfully lured Qin Yu Out. Don’t worry, the Heavenly Cloud sect will definitely remember you!”

Di Zun was stunned on the spot. He didn’t even react for a moment.

“First elder, what... What do you mean? !”Di Zun had a bad feeling.

First Elder smiled. “Alright, you have completed your mission. You can come back now.”

As he spoke, the eighteen gods suddenly appeared from the void in front of him.

The first elder also took out the void-return weapon!

“Hahahaha!”First Elder stroked his beard and laughed maniacally.

“Little Bastard, do you really think that I will talk to you? Do you have the qualifications to talk to my Heavenly Cloud Sect? !”The first elder shouted.

“First Elder, you... You Lied to me? !”Di ZUN’s expression immediately changed!

He hurriedly looked at Qin Yu and said with some panic, “Master, I. . . I didn’t know that he would bring people here. I swear that I absolutely didn’t know!”
