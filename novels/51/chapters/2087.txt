2088 The Teng Family’s Grand Event

When Qin Yu heard this, his pupils constricted and he asked, “Teng Zixu? He’s stepped into the True Saint cultivation realm?”

Yes.” Dean Lei nodded. “Just as you’ve guessed, Teng Zixu is the first person who has stepped into the True Saint cultivation realm in the younger generation.”

Qin Yu frowned, and a sense of urgency welled up in his heart.

As the number one genius of the Holy Region, Teng Zixu had already stepped into the True Saint cultivation realm. This caused immense pressure on Qin Yu.

“It is unexpected that Im once again suppressed when I’ve just caught up to them…” Qin Yu could not help but laugh bitterly.

Dean Lei laughed and said, “You don’t have to belittle yourself. Teng Zixu is the only one who has stepped into the True Saint cultivation realm. Moreover, he has always been ahead of all his peers.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. He was curious about Teng Zixu.

All along, Qin Yu had thought that Si Shiyue, Yao Xi, Saintess Gu, and others were unrivaled geniuses that were rarely seen. Even Qin Yu could feel the pressure.

He had never expected the Holy Region to have a genius who could suppress them. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Dean Lei told Qin Yu about the banquet to be held by the Teng family. It was a good opportunity for Qin Yu, so without thinking, he decided to attend the event.

Of course, although the Teng family had given the order not to fight during the banquet, no one knew if the Teng family would make a move for the Traceless Immortal Scripture. Therefore, Qin Yu decided to temporarily hide the Traceless Immortal Scripture in Thunder Courtyard in case of any untoward incidents.

“There is one more thing that I must tell you.” At this moment, Dean Lei suddenly said.

Seeing Dean Lei’s solemn expression, Qin Yu felt a little uneasy.

He did not say a word and waited for Dean Lei to continue.

“The day of the Path of Heaven is about to come. It won’t take more than three months,” Dean Lei said.

“What?” Qin Yu’s expression changed, and he said in shock. “So soon? Didn’t you say that it would take at least a year?”

“In the Golden Age, dao techniques are unpredictable, and anyone’s speculation may be flawed.” Dean Lei shook his head.

Qin Yu’s face turned ugly. The day of the Path of Heaven implied that Si Shiyue and Yan Ruoxue were getting engaged.

It was not good news for Qin Yu.

However, on second thought, Qin Yu realized that he and Si Shiyue were in the same cultivation realm. It was not certain who would win.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu felt much more relieved.

“Now that the world belongs to the younger generation, I believe those old b*stards from the various aristocratic families will not easily make a move.” Dean Lei’s words made Qin Yu feel even more relieved.

“I understand, Dean Lei.” Qin Yu hurriedly bowed.

Meanwhile, the Teng family had already begun to prepare for the grand banquet.

The place where the Teng family was located was incredibly unique. It was a small world created by their ancestors.

This small world was incredibly stable. Rumor had it that it was not inferior to the Holy Region and would not collapse easily.

Numerous people began to gather toward the direction of the Teng family. This small world was located in the void. It was originally empty, but now it was shining with resplendence and sparkling with vibrant colors as if it was making an announcement to the world.

Through the resplendence, everyone could enter the Teng family. However, it was not time yet, so the door of the Teng family had not yet opened.

Three days passed quickly, and soon, it was the day of the grand event.

On this day, Dean Lei handed Qin Yu a gift box.

“Dean Lei, what is this?” Qin Yu said in surprise.

“You will represent Thunder Courtyard to send a congratulatory gift to the Teng family.” Dean Lei stroked his beard and smiled.

Qin Yu suddenly realized. That was right. Such a grand event would require one to bring gifts.

Thunder Courtyard, an academy that could almost be compared to the nine great aristocratic families certainly had to send a gift.

“As long as I bring this gift, everyone will understand that I represent Thunder Courtyard and will not simply attack me,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

However, there was nothing to be afraid of at this moment. Now that Qin Yu had stepped into the Semi-Saint realm, coupled with Wu Ji’s divine robe and the Mysterious Heavenly Mirror, Qin Yu had the confidence to escape if he faced a True Saint.

Immediately after, Qin Yu relied on the teleportation formation of Thunder Courtyard and rushed toward the Teng family’s residence.

Below the Teng family’s residence, it was already overcrowded with people. The door above had already opened, and strands of the resplendence of vibrant colors bloomed.

Through the strands of the resplendence of vibrant colors, one could see an ancient aura on the huge door as if it had existed for thousands of years.

All kinds of mysterious runes were engraved on the door, and a strange luster was flowing. These runes seemed to have possessed some kind of power, causing one’s heart to tremble when one glanced at them.

The gate of the Teng family was not made of ordinary materials. Instead, it was carved from a rare natural spirit stone that emitted dense spiritual energy.

This kind of spirit stone was extremely precious and could only appear in specific earth veins. It could increase the stability of the formation and make the entire small world safer.

Qin Yu, holding the gift box in his hand, stepped into the crowd.

Qin Yu had now become a well-known person in the Holy Region. His appearance immediately attracted countless gazes and discussions.

“Qin Yu? He actually came?”

“Tsk tsk! He’s so bold! He escaped with great difficulty a dozen days ago, and now he dares to come to the Teng family.”

“He probably knows the rules of the Teng family, so he’s fearless.”

“So what? After he leaves the Teng family, who will care about the rules?”

“You guys don’t think it so simple. Since he dares to come, he naturally has confidence. Can’t you see that he’s still holding a gift box in his hand? That brocade box is obviously exclusive to Dean Lei.”

Qin Yu did not care about the discussions among the crowd. With a stomp of his feet, he disappeared into the resplendence of vibrant colors and stepped into the gate of the Teng family, entering the small world that was unique to the family.

The moment he stepped into this small world, Qin Yu could not help but be tremendously shocked! This small world was indeed different from any other Mystic Realms!

The moment Qin Yu stepped in, he did not feel any difference from the outside world. Be it spiritual energy or the dao technique. They were exactly the same!

“This… This doesn’t seem to be man-made, but rather, formed naturally according to the real world,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

The entire Teng family was incomparably huge. After all, they occupied a world by themselves, and no other sect or aristocratic family could compare to them.

Unlike the Yan family and the Si Family, this place was closer to nature, as if he had entered a natural landscape.

“No wonder the Teng family has generously invited everyone. The number of people this small world can accommodate is too terrifying.” Qin Yu could not help but shake his head and sigh. He was also becoming even more curious about the Teng family.

“Brother Qin.”

At this moment, a familiar voice came from behind. Turning around, he saw Saintess Gu and Yao Xi walking toward him.

“Saintess Gu. It’s good to see you,” Qin Yu replied with a smile.
