Qin Yu followed behind Zhuang Teng and walked in a certain direction.

On the way, Zhuang Teng could not help but ask with some doubt, “Brother Qin, did you really kill Granny Qin?”

Qin Yu glanced at him and shook his head. “No.”

“Brother Qin has always kept a low profile,”Chu Heng said with a smile.

Qin Yu did not explain. He knew that it was useless to explain.

As they spoke, they came to a pavilion.

There was a stone table in the pavilion. The table was already filled with people.

Almost all the young masters of the aristocratic families of Jingdu were gathered here.

Other than Zhuang Teng and Chu Heng, Chu Hedao, Kong Yun, Yao Meng, Xiao Yuan, and the others were all gathered here.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

He subconsciously glanced at Zhuang Teng and seemed to understand what these people meant.

These people clearly recognized Qin Yu and wanted to pull Qin Yu into their so-called circle.

“Brother Qin!”After seeing Qin Yu, Xiao Yuan stood up and cupped his hands with Qin Yu.

Qin Yu bowed slightly as a return gift.

Then, he casually found a seat and sat down.

“Qin Yu, you are truly glorious now. Even Granny Qin died at your hands,”someone said from the side. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“That’s right. Granny Qin has roamed the Jingdu for so many years. No one would have thought that she would die at the hands of a junior.”

“Sigh, I originally thought that you came from a humble background and couldn’t achieve great things, but I didn’t expect you to have come to this stage today.”

Hearing everyone’s flattery, Qin Yu did not say a word.

He was not interested in the circle of the young masters of Jingdu, and he did not have a good impression of them. Naturally, he did not say much.

“Why isn’t Yan Jinyao Here?”At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly realized something.

As expected, Yan Jinyao was nowhere to be seen.

“I heard that Yan Jinyao is in closed door cultivation,”Kong Yun said.

“Closed-door cultivation?”Qin Yu frowned slightly.

“Breaking through to the half-step martial saint?”

“Not really. He should be breaking through to the perfect stage,”Xiao Yuan continued.

Qin Yu nodded.

It seemed that he should find time to go into closed-door cultivation after this period of time.

“Oh, right.”At this moment, Qin Yu looked at the crowd.

“I heard that everyone has entered the Scripture depository before, right?”

Yao Meng was the first to nod and say, “En, normally speaking, everyone present should have entered the scripture depository before, but the number of times is different. I’ve only entered it three times.”

“Like Yan Jinyao, he should be the person who has entered the scripture depository the most times.”

Xiao Yuan also nodded slightly and said, “En, the Yan family’s business is huge. Ordinary people can’t compare to him.”

Qin Yu swept his gaze over everyone and continued, “I’m very curious, what exactly is in this scripture depository, and what did everyone obtain inside?”

“Haha, Brother Qin, you don’t know this,”Zhuang Teng said with a faint smile.

“The reason why the Scripture Pavilion is called the Scripture Pavilion is because it has been passed down from Buddhism to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

Qin Yu exclaimed, “Passed down from Buddhism? That is to say, all the records in the Scripture Pavilion were not compiled by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?”

“Of course not. The JINGDU martial arts association has only been there for a few years. How could they record so much martial arts history?”Someone beside him shook his head.

“However, the JINGDU martial arts association has indeed supplemented the scripture pavilion over the past few years. Compared to the past, the current scripture pavilion is even more abundant.”

This immediately made Qin Yu even more interested in the scripture pavilion.

“Speaking of which, the records in the Scripture Pavilion should be the most comprehensive. be it spells or the history of martial arts development,”Zhuang Teng said in a deep voice.

“That’s right.”Kong Yun, who had been silent all this time, also nodded his head.

“Unfortunately, I’ve only been there three times. What I’ve seen and heard can’t be considered much.”

It could be seen that everyone present was full of yearning for the scripture pavilion.

Seeing this, Qin Yu immediately took the opportunity to say, “Everyone, are you interested in entering the scripture pavilion again?”

“Brother Qin, I don’t think anyone can resist the temptation of this scripture pavilion, right?”Xiao Yuan said with a smile.

Qin Yu stood up and said, “If that’s the case, then please follow me to the JINGDU martial arts association to apply.”

“As the first batch of martial arts academies, we should have the qualifications to enter the Scripture Pavilion.”

“And you are all descendants of the various aristocratic families. I believe that the Jingdu martial arts association may not be able to withstand your pressure.”

As soon as these words were said, everyone immediately looked at each other.

“Brother Qin, are you serious?”Yao Meng said in surprise.

“Of course. All of you have at least entered the scripture depository, but I haven’t been there once,”Qin Yu said.

Everyone was silent for a moment. At this time, Xiao Yuan stood up and said, “I agree with Brother Qin.”

“That’s right. He, Yan Jinyao, can enter the Scripture depository many times. Why Can’t we?”Kong Yun also said.

A stone creates a thousand ripples. Everyone agreed with Qin Yu’s words.

Seeing this, Qin Yu stood up and said, “Then don’t waste time. Let’s set off now and go to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

A group of people immediately followed behind Qin Yu and walked towards the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

Arriving at Xia Hang’s office, under Qin Yu’s lead, everyone expressed their thoughts one after another.

Xia hang and Qin Yu had already communicated with each other. Now that all the young masters of each family had requested to enter the Scripture Pavilion, Xia hang naturally went with the flow.

“I will carefully consider this matter,”Xia hang pretended to say.

“How about this, you guys go back first. I will give you an answer as soon as possible.”

Qin Yu said intentionally or unintentionally at the side, “Try to be as fast as possible. Don’t waste our time.”

Xia hang was silent for a moment and said, “Normally, I can’t make the decision for this kind of thing. But now that Granny Qin is dead, I can only temporarily take the lead.”

“Since everyone is so eager, then I’ll make the decision. Tomorrow Morning at eight o’clock, we’ll gather at the Martial Arts Academy.”

“Thank you, President Xia!”Everyone was instantly overjoyed.

After walking out of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, everyone said in surprise, “Brother Qin, I didn’t expect Xia hang to really agree.”

“Yeah, Brother Qin is really capable!”

Qin Yu also smiled and said, “It has nothing to do with me. It’s mainly because the family behind everyone has played a role.”

Of course, these words were just a humble sentence.

After greeting everyone, Qin Yu was ready to leave.

“Brother Qin.”

At this moment, Yao Meng suddenly chased after him.

Qin Yu glanced at her and said, “Miss Yao, what’s the matter?”

Yao Meng said in a deep voice, “It’s said that Ruoxue was taken away by you. Is that true?”

“Yes.”Qin Yu did not hide anything.

Yao Meng continued, “You went to the Scripture Depository also for Ruoxue?”

Qin Yu frowned and finally nodded, “Yes, what exactly do you want to ask?”

“Miss Yao wants to remind you that Yan Ruoxue is not safe in your hands. Once she leaves the second secret realm, countless people will target her.”

Just as Yao Meng was about to speak, a young man walked over.

This young man was none other than the Wan Gu Qiong whom she had seen last time.
