1892 The Story of the Man with the Mustache and the Gu Saintess

He looked around and said softly, “It is indeed a sanctum of a Tribulation Stage great cultivator, but it’s a pity that it’s incomplete.”

“Incomplete?” Qin Yu was stunned.

“Mmm,” the man with the mustache responded and then said, “If it’s a complete sanctum, we aren’t qualified to enter at all, and we’ll probably be killed instantly the moment we step in!”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. A Tribulation Stage great cultivator was not someone they could mess with.

“If it’s a complete sanctum, do you think we’re qualified to be here? The nine great aristocratic families would have come here to fight for it long ago. They wouldn’t have just sent a few juniors over,” the man with the mustache continued.

“To put it bluntly, for us, this incomplete sanctum is a god-sent opportunity, but to them, it’s just a chance for their juniors’ training.” The man with the mustache snorted.

“I see. No wonder the Gu family’s saintess didn’t have anyone following her,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

At the mention of the Gu family’s saintess, the man with the mustache became a little unnatural, and his body trembled slightly.

Noticing the abnormality of the man with the mustache, Qin Yu frowned and said, “What’s the matter with you?”

“Nothing,” the man with the mustache waved his hand and said.

Although he noticed the abnormality of the man with the mustache, Qin Yu didn’t think much about it and continued to ask, “Then how do you enter this sanctum? Even though it’s incomplete, we can’t just walk in like this, right?”

“Of course, but that won’t be a problem for me. I’ve been traveling around for so many years. What haven’t I seen? That’s a moving treasure vault!” the man with the mustache said proudly.

Qin Yu was overjoyed. He knew well the man with the mustache would have a way.

Therefore, Qin Yu nudged his mustache with his shoulder and said with a smile, “If there’s anything good, take it out and let all enjoy it.”

The man with the mustache immediately hid to the side, rolled his eyes, and said, “Do you think this treasure is like a cabbage on the street? I only have one, just one!”

Qin Yu laughed and said, “Stop pretending. You’re a famous moving treasure vault. How can you only have one? You’re just stingy.”

Hearing Qin Yu’s words, the man with the mustache said with some pride, “Of course, I…”

The man with the mustache suddenly realized that something was wrong. He quickly changed his words and said, “Nonsense! How would I have any treasure? I almost got tricked by you!”

“Come on! We’re from the same hometown! As fellow townsmen, shouldn’t we support each other?” Qin Yu said with a smile.

However, even after Qin Yu said all the good things, the man with the mustache still refused to give in. He waved his hands repeatedly and insisted that he didn’t have any treasure.

Qin Yu had no choice but to give up for the time being.

“This guy with the mustache looks treacherous,” Chang Mang snorted and said.

“It’s fine,” Qin Yu said with a smile. “We’ll follow him for the next few days. We’ll go in the same way he does.”

“Mmm,” Chang Mang responded and didn’t say anything else.

In the following few days, the sanctum was still rumbling, and there was a strange phenomenon from time to time.

Qin Yu finally knew from where the strange phenomenon of Peaceful Land City came. The loud sounds were coming from the emergence of the sanctum.

Every time a part of the sanctum was revealed, it would cause heaven and earth to rumble continuously.

In just a few days, more than half of the sanctum had appeared.

The sanctum was much larger than he had imagined. At a glance, he could see several altars on the temple. There were flags on the altars, which looked incredibly majestic. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“It’s only an incomplete sanctum. I really don’t know how grand a complete sanctum would be,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

With the emergence of the sanctum, more and more people appeared in the vicinity. Many big shots had rushed to the venue.

Although this sanctum was not worth the nine great aristocratic families’ actions, it was a rare opportunity for the other first-class aristocratic families.

He raised his head and saw numerous carriages flying across the sky before finally landing in an unknown area.

Another few days passed.

The sanctum was finally completely unearthed.

That night, the surroundings were extremely chaotic. Some people knelt and worshipped the sanctum, some were full of longing, and some couldn’t help but try to step into it. In the end, they ended up becoming ashes and dust.

Qin Yu and Chang Mang followed the man with the mustache, fearing he would slip away.

“Eh?”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of a very important thing, the memory left by his father!

Ever since the golden door was opened, not only did Qin Yu obtain numerous top-notch cultivation techniques, but also numerous information about the hidden treasures!

“I wonder if this sanctum is among them,” Qin Yu exclaimed.

Thinking of this, he quickly sat cross-legged on the ground and began to use his primordial spirit to try to search the sanctum.

In a short while, Qin Yu actually found it!

He suddenly opened his eyes, looking extremely excited!

“I didn’t expect this sanctum to be in my father’s memory!” Qin Yu murmured.

As such, it would be a piece of cake for Qin Yu to obtain an opportunity in this sanctum, as the memory even pointed out the way for Qin Yu!

Even the nine great aristocratic families couldn’t be compared to such thoughtful guidance!

This was the terrifying thing about the Guardian. They knew almost all the secret treasures in the world!

“It seems that I have to find a way to get the method to enter the sanctum from the man with the mustache,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu looked at the man with the mustache again. He quickly walked forward and stuck close to him, afraid he would sneak away.

The man with the mustache opened his mouth and was about to say something when his expression changed slightly. He quickly used a technique to cover his face.

“Eh?” Qin Yu once again noticed the abnormality of the man with the mustache.

He looked up and saw an auspicious cloud floating in the sky. An extremely beautiful woman was stepping on it and floating over from not far away.

The people around were all amazed by her beauty.

...

“The saintess of the Gu family?” Qin Yu was stunned. He looked at the man with the mustache and grinned, “Man with the mustache, is there a story between you and the saintess of the Gu family?”

Upon hearing this, the man with the mustache trembled slightly. He quickly shook his head and said, “Don’t blabber. I don’t know who the saintess of the Gu family is.”

“You don’t know her? Then why are you so nervous?” Qin Yu said with a smile.

“Who’s nervous?” the man with the mustache man said stubbornly. “I just like to keep a low profile!”

“Is that so?” Qin Yu rolled his eyes and shouted, “Saintess of the Gu family, the man with the mustache…”

“F*ck! You shut up!” the man with the mustache quickly covered Qin Yu’s mouth with his hand.

But Qin Yu’s shout had attracted the attention of numerous people, including the saintess of the Gu family.
