Chapter 1387: Chapter 1387, farewell to Di Zun 1

Qin Yu kept silent and walked towards the old man step by step.

Ding Yi hurriedly blocked in front of Qin Yu and said, “Yan Qin, he said so. You... Don’t kill him.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He looked at Ding Yi coldly and said, “Are you sure you want to let him go?”

“I’m sure!”Ding Yi said without hesitation.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. She pushed Ding Yi away and then raised her hand to slap the old man’s neck.

The old man’s eyes darted around and he instantly fainted on the ground.

Ding Yi’s face changed greatly. She looked at the old man lying on the ground and was momentarily speechless.

“You see, he was only beaten up at first, but now he wants to lose his life,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“Sometimes, to do good deeds, you need to think. Otherwise, it’s easy to attract a bigger disaster.”

Ding Yi didn’t say anything. He just stood there for a long time.

“Don’t worry. I didn’t kill him. He just fainted. He will wake up in a few days,”Qin Yu said indifferently.

“You can ignore your own safety, but I have to promise that nothing will happen before I leave.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and walked towards the Heavenly Cloud sect.

Ding Yi looked at Qin Yu’s back, his gaze becoming more and more blurred.

She couldn’t figure it out. She couldn’t figure out who this Yan Qin was.

Why did he have such powerful strength, yet he had to hide in a small restaurant, and why did he know so much.

Slowly, Ding Yi’s image in front of him seemed to become clearer.

...

In the Heavenly Cloud sect, Qin Yu and Ding Yi went to deliver the goods as usual.

After delivering the goods, Qin Yu covered her stomach and said, “Not good, my stomach is not feeling well. I have to go to the toilet. where is your toilet?”

The disciple in charge of receiving the goods said impatiently, “Lazy donkeys have a lot of SH * t and urine. Over there, go find it yourself!”

“Thank you, thank you,”Qin Yu replied. Then, without turning back, he left the storeroom in a hurry.

After he walked out of the storeroom, he began to search for the great elder’s cultivation room according to the information he had gathered over the past few days.

During these few days, Qin Yu had already figured out the location of the cultivation room, so it was not difficult to find it. It did not take long for him to find the great elder’s cultivation room. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

It was an extremely huge cultivation room filled with rich spiritual energy.

It was said that this cultivation room was the most luxurious place in the entire heavenly cloud sect, except for the sect master’s Cultivation Mountain.

“Are you sure that your disciple won’t betray you?”Tie Dan suddenly reminded him.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Absolutely not. I believe in him.”

Seeing this, tie Dan didn’t say anything more.

Qin Yu looked around. After making sure that no one was around, he tiptoed into the cultivation room.

As soon as he entered, Qin Yu smelled a trace of intense spiritual energy. It was so dense that Qin Yu had never seen it before.

And in this cultivation room, there were all kinds of magic tools to help with cultivation.

In the deepest part of the cultivation room, a young man was sitting cross-legged, breathing and breathing.

This young man was none other than Di Zun!

“Who is it!”

Soon, Di Zun found Qin Yu.

He opened his eyes abruptly, and a sharp aura rushed toward Qin Yu!

Qin Yu raised her palm and covered it.

This aura instantly vanished into thin air.

Di ZUN’s expression changed slightly and he said coldly, “You have some ability...”

“Brat, don’t talk nonsense with me!”Qin Yu said with her eyes wide open.

“I am Qin Yu!”

Hearing this, Di Zun was stunned. Then, he took a step forward and came in front of Qin Yu.

“You... You Are Qin Yu? Nonsense. Qin Yu doesn’t look like this!”Di Zun berated.

“Who are you? How dare you call someone else!”

Qin Yu raised her hand and patted di Zun’s head, saying, “If I don’t change my appearance, would I dare to come here? Cut the crap. I don’t have much time, so I’ll make it short.”

Di Zun became more and more suspicious. The voice of the person in front of him was indeed very similar to Qin Yu, but no one could guarantee that this was not sent by the Tianyun sect to test him.

“Don’t talk nonsense. If you dare to talk nonsense again, don’t blame me for being impolite!”Di Zun said with a cold face.

Qin Yu could not help but feel a headache. He could only tell di zun about his experience, including how he came to the Holy Region and how the two of them discussed it.

Only after hearing all this did di zun believe that the person in front of him was Qin Yu.

“Master, why... Why are you here? Don’t you know that the Heavenly Cloud sect is looking for you?”Di Zun looked around and said nervously.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “I overheard the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s plan. They plan to send Zhen Yue and the others to the Green Rock Forest and then take the opportunity to kill them.”

Di ZUN’s expression changed and he frowned, “Master, are you telling the truth?”

“Yes. To make a long story short, they were brought here by me after all. I have to be responsible for their safety. Find an opportunity to bring them out of the Heavenly Cloud sect. I’ll bring them out of here,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Di Zun couldn’t help but fall into silence when he heard this.

A moment later, Di Zun shook his head and said, “Master, even if we bring them out, how can you guarantee their safety? You Can’t protect yourself now. Adding a few more burdens will probably be more troublesome.”

“I know, but it’s better than leaving them here to die,”Qin Yu said with a frown.

“Master, don’t worry. I’ll guarantee their safety. Later, I’ll go to the great elder and ask them to come to my side,”said Di Zun.

“As long as they follow me, no one can hurt them.”
