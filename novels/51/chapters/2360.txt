2361 Sailing through the Sea of Space

The fruits the Green Spirit Tree bore contained enormous spiritual energy. Furthermore, the purity level was even higher.

The completion rate of the entire holy body had reached more than 90%. With a thought, he appeared on the continent.

He threw a punch directly, and the fist energy instantly leveled a mountain peak before him.

“Let me try!”

Jue Wu curiously rushed over and punched Qin Yu’s body.

Qin Yu did not dodge at all and allowed the fist to hit his chest.

The muscles directly shook off 70% – 80% of the terrifying strength. The remaining strength circulated in his body and could not cause any harm to him at all.

He grabbed at Jue Wu, and Jue Wu could not break free no matter how hard she tried.

“F*ck, your strength is too terrifying! It seems that you haven’t used any spiritual energy.”

Jue Wu looked like she saw a monster.

“I feel that my full-strength punch might exceed the restricted power of the Path of Heaven.”

Qin Yu withdrew his fist and said seriously.

The Glazed Holy Body was equivalent to compressing chaotic power to the extreme. The same bone could accommodate such a vast amount of spiritual energy.

This meant the purity of the spiritual energy had been compressed to an extremely high level, and he had an unrivaled advantage regardless of launching a technique or engaging in a direct clash of spiritual energy.

The current Qin Yu relied on the strength of the Glazed Holy Body to directly break through to the Saint Realm with the strength of the fourth grade.

He suddenly realized that whether it was the masked woman of the nine lifetimes, the evil exterminator, Teng Zixu, or even Immortal Crane, Si Liuhe, Si Shiyu, or even Dean Lei, they would all open up a vast chasm after the arrival of the golden age.

Everyone had their own comprehension of the rules of the dao technique, which was why there would be terrifying Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivators in the Degenerate Age like Wu Ji. Most of them would not advance further after they stepped into the Tribulation Transcending Stage.

For example, once the golden age descended, the masked woman would definitely break through to the Tribulation Transcending Stage in an invincible manner and sweep away everyone.

Everyone would look for the path to break through to the Imperial Immortal there, and they could find the path by exploring themselves.

“Qin Yu, the Sumeru ring needs to be repaired as well. The entire Sumeru ring is on the verge of collapse.”

“Alright, now that we have Ji Yue’s Sumeru qi, let’s settle this matter now.”

He sat cross-legged on the ground and opened the jar that stored the Sumeru qi.

The pale yellow Sumeru qi drifted into the space like gold and was sucked into the Sumeru ring.

In an instant, countless the Way of Space shuttled back and forth like embroidery threads, slowly repairing the broken space.

Qin Yu’s desolate divine eye stared at the evolution of the spatial rules, from destruction to rebirth.

The current Qin Yu no longer had to worry about the terrifying spiritual energy consumption of the desolate divine eye. His hands continuously tried the evolution of the spatial rules he observed, and countless small spatial phantoms appeared in his hands.

He was completely immersed in the comprehension of the Way of Space.

As countless amounts of Sumeru qi entered, the Sumeru ring directly recovered and was reborn.

At this moment, his desolate divine eye had been activated to the utmost. In the world of the desolate divine eye, countless layers of space formed the spatial rules of this world.

The world of Sumeru was inside, and the outside was the world of purgatory. Below purgatory were various low-dimensional spaces, including the monster and ghost realms.

Above was the Holy Region that encompassed all the worlds. He could not observe anything above that.

However, he could vaguely sense the existence of a higher layer of space.

Qin Yu’s hands gently touched the immediate edges of Sumeru. Countless Way of Space was faintly discernible on his hands.

With the continuous calling of the immediate edge of Sumeru, and under everyone’s shocked gazes, Qin Yu’s body slowly integrated into Sumeru.

“Qin Yu!”

Jue Wu panicked and wanted to pull him back.

“Don’t worry, he seems to have entered some sort of space comprehension realm. Perhaps he had some epiphany while repairing the Sumeru ring! This kind of opportunity is indeed tremendously precious.”

Elder Guai stopped Jue Wu.

Qin Yu only felt his soul immerse into the space. In an instant, he had traveled through dozens of planes. He saw the origin plane of the monster race and the spatial plane of the Holy Region.

That feeling was incredibly mysterious. No matter how fast one was, it was impossible to travel through so many planes in an instant.

The Sumeru ring was another world a spatial mighty realm cultivator had created. This world had its own rules. Qin Yu used his desolate divine eye to observe the process of its collapse and rebirth and comprehended a tremendously valuable way during the process.

Was this the process of advancing from fourth grade to fifth grade? This was the first time Qin Yu had comprehended such a wonderful feeling.

After that, a ladder leading to heaven appeared before him, and he slowly walked up.

He was as small as a speck of dust on the stairway to heaven.

He could sense even more extreme spatial rules here.

As he walked on the stairway to heaven, a feeling of “fear” arose spontaneously.

He seemed to be walking on the path of heaven and earth. The surrounding ocean could swallow him up if the waves were slightly bigger.

After a long time, he finally climbed to the top.

An enormous statue was on it.

No matter how hard Qin Yu tried, he could not see his face clearly.

He extended a hand to the furthest, with a mesmerizing Spatial Power surging within it.

QinYu walked up to that person, and only then did he unconsciously realize that his body had gradually stooped while climbing the stairway to heaven.

Just a moment ago, he could crawl here and enter that hand. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

His body seemed to have been sucked into the statue’s hand uncontrollably, and his head was pressed down by the hand.

In an instant, he seemed to feel that he was sailing through the spatial qi in an ocean, and his soul was completely sailing in it.

With a thought, the spatial qi transformed into a new space and a spatial sword.

He only needed a thought to use the Spatial Power.

His two souls stood quietly on the spot, and then the origin between his divine sense slowly melted.

The golden and black origins flowed into the river and slowly merged with the river.

“No!”

Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes, and the Soul Shattering Golden Radiance slashed out.

At the same time, the black Qin Yu’s Soul Torment Mind Technique also slashed out almost simultaneously, and his origin immediately returned to his true body.

Qin Yu felt himself spinning in an instant and subsequently returned to the Sumeru ring.
