Chapter 1034: Chapter 1,034, Star Seizer!

Qin Yu, who was about to leave, stopped in his tracks.

He turned around and looked at the eight high-ranking officials present. He asked in a deep voice, “What do you know?”

“We know more than you think,”the high-ranking officials said coldly.

“Don’t you want to know the bloodline of the Yan family, the secret realm of the Yan Family?”They continued.

“We can tell you the way to the secret realm of the Yan family. Is this reason enough?”

Qin Yu quietly looked at the darkness in front of him. After a while, Qin Yu grinned and said, “I’ll ask you myself after I’ve conquered the first secret realm.”

“Qin Yu, if you leave now, you won’t have a chance in the future. We’ll do our best to get rid of you!”A shrill woman’s voice sounded behind him.

Qin Yu ignored her and left in large strides.

All the dirty things were ordered by these eight people.

Whether it was the arrest of Yan Ruoxue or the pursuit of Qin Yu, the eight of them were the main culprits.

It was impossible to reconcile with them.

After leaving the meeting room, Qin Yu was not in a hurry to leave.

When he came to the martial arts association in Jingdu, Qin Yu had always come and left in a hurry. After all, there were too many people and things that he was afraid of.

But now that Qin Yu had entered the martial arts association of Jingdu, it was as if he had entered a place where no one could stop him.

He quickly walked in the direction of the prison.

There were still people guarding the door of this prison.

The two warriors in charge of guarding the door quickly turned their faces to the side the moment they saw Qin Yu, afraid to meet Qin Yu’s eyes.

Qin Yu coldly snorted and said, “Where’s the key? Open this door.”

“Qin... Qin Yu, this key isn’t in our hands. We don’t have such High Authority...”

Their voices were trembling, as if they were afraid of angering the god of death in front of them.

Qin Yu glanced at them and said, “Where’s the key?”

Before the two of them could answer, Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Forget it. It’s too troublesome to take the key.”

After saying that, Qin Yu clenched his fist and smashed it towards the door!

“Boom!”

After a loud sound, rays of light appeared on the door.

This light was obviously a formation set up! Under Qin Yu’s punch, it instantly shattered!

Without the formation, the door was not worth mentioning.

Qin Yu used violence to demolish the door and Strode into the prison.

The prison was empty. Last time, Qin Yu had already let everyone out.

He directly passed through this prison and Strode into the depths.

In the depths, there was another large door.

This large door was simple and unadorned, yet extremely imposing.

It was rumored that behind this large door, martial saints were imprisoned!

For so many years, they had never opened this door!

“Even martial saints are imprisoned. I really don’t know how much rice this Jingdu martial arts association still has.”Qin Yu stood at the door and muttered in a low voice.

As he spoke, the aura on his body rapidly rose. Then, with a shake of his Golden Fist, the door gave off a loud bang!

This sound shook all directions, and the entire Jingdu’s martial arts association was shaken!

One punch, two punches, three punches!

Under Qin Yu’s three strikes, the door began to collapse!

The building could not withstand this power, and it stirred up waves of dust!

“Boom!”

With another punch, the golden light cut through the pitch-black door!

Under the brute force, the door, which was covered with countless taboos, completely collapsed! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

After passing through the door, the first thing that came into view was not another prison, but a piece of nothingness.

“As expected, it’s just as I imagined.”

Qin Yu was not surprised to see this scene.

Just as he had guessed, the martial saint was not imprisoned, but in a secret realm!

Qin Yu walked forward and stretched out his hand, trying to find the entrance to this secret realm.

Soon, a light flashed in front of Qin Yu.

Qin Yu used the same trick again, wanting to forcefully break open this secret realm. Unfortunately, after Qin Yu had spent a lot of effort, this entrance still did not budge.

Could it be that this secret realm is above the Wan family’s secret realm? Qin Yu thought to himself.

To be able to forcefully break open the Wan family’s secret realm and not be able to break open this secret realm...

This was enough to prove that this secret realm was probably more stable and mysterious than the Wan family’s secret realm!

After standing here and thinking for a long time, Qin Yu finally left this place.

There was still a long way to go, so Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry.

After leaving the martial arts association of Jingdu, Qin Yu didn’t stay any longer and returned to the Heaven Gate.

Qin Yu’s actions undoubtedly angered the eight higher-ups.

In the second secret realm, a figure suddenly descended.

This figure was also not the original body, so one could only see a blurry figure.

Seeing this person, Gu Zizhen hurriedly stood up with a respectful expression.

“Greetings, higher-ups.”Gu Zizhen bowed and said.

The higher-ups looked at Gu Zizhen and coldly said, “No matter what, you must guard the second mystic realm. I want you to do your best to get rid of Qin Yu.”

Gu Zizhen hurriedly said, “Please rest assured, higher-ups. As long as Qin Yu dares to come, I guarantee that he will never return!”

“I want you to get rid of Qin Yu as soon as possible!”The higher-ups’voice contained some anger.

“Yes!”Gu Zizhen didn’t dare to disobey and hurriedly agreed.

“As long as you get rid of Qin Yu, I’ll let you enter the first mystic realm and reunite with your son,”the higher-ups said indifferently.

Gu Zizhen’s expression slightly changed.

He knew very well that these words were not only encouraging him, but also threatening him with Gu Xinghe’s!

After the higher-ups left, a grave expression appeared on Gu Zizhen’s face.

“Go and call Zhai Xing over,”gu Zizhen said in a deep voice.

“There’s no need to call him over.”At this moment, Zhai Xing took the initiative to walk over.

Gu Zizhen glanced at Zhai Xing and said coldly, “Go kill Qin Yu and bring his corpse back.”

Zhai Xing seemed to have guessed it long ago. He nodded slightly and said, “Got it.”

After saying this, Zhai Xing prepared to leave.

“Wait.”

At this moment, Gu Zizhen called out to Zhai Xing.

He took out a spiritual artifact from his spatial artifact and handed it to Zhai Xing.

This spiritual artifact was shaped like a bell. Although it wasn’t big, it was extremely heavy.

On the surface of this bell, one after another extremely strange talismans were carved.

“Soul Bell?”Seeing this object, Zhai Xing frowned slightly.

“That’s right,”gu Zizhen said coldly.

“I don’t need this item.”Zhai Xing returned the Soul Bell to Gu Zizhen.

However, Gu Zizhen said stubbornly, “Take it with you. Remember, no matter what price you have to pay, you must kill him.”

Zhai Xing held the soul bell, but there was a hint of fear on his face.

It was as if this soul bell was some shocking taboo item.
