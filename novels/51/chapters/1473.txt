Chapter 1474: Chapter 1,474:100,000-year-old Herbs! 1

The medicinal fragrance of the medicine saint capital was extremely rich, causing people to be unable to leave.

Qin Yu breathed in this internal Qi forcefully, feeling refreshed.

Around the medicine saint capital, there were countless medicinal stalls with a dazzling array of herbs.

Qin Yu had the desolate God’s eye, so he could see the age of the herbs at a glance.

These herbs were all more than ten thousand years old. It could be seen that ten thousand-year-old herbs were not rare in the holy region.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He sized up these herbs and said in a low voice, “Even the two sides of the herb stall are ten thousand-year-old herbs. Then what kind of herbs should be in that palace?”

He did not dare to imagine! Those were probably herbs that were tens of thousands of years old!

Although the requirement for the age of the herbs in the nascent soul pill wasn’t high, the quality of the herbs also determined the quality of the nascent soul pill. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Therefore, if he could get herbs with a higher age, Qin Yu would naturally try them out.

Therefore, Qin Yu walked toward the palace while admiring the herbs on both sides.

When he got close to the palace, Qin Yu found that the palace was shining with golden light and glass, and it was shining with an extremely luxurious brilliance everywhere.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown. His impression of the medicine sage city had been greatly reduced.

At the entrance of the palace stood two guards. These two guards were actually at the mighty realm.

The weapons they held were also extremely extraordinary. They far surpassed the batch of weapons purchased by the Hunter organization.

It was very clear that the profit of the medicine sage city was very considerable.

Qin Yu took a step forward. Just as he approached, he was stopped by two guards.

“This place is an important place for alchemists to refine pills. Outsiders are not allowed to get close,”the two guards said coldly.

Qin Yu raised his head to glance at the palace and said, “May I ask what’s inside?”

The guard looked at Qin Yu as if he was looking at an idiot and said, “Of course there are alchemists. Are you deliberately finding trouble?”

Qin Yu quickly waved his hand and said, “Of course not. Don’t misunderstand. I’m just curious.”

The guard snorted coldly, as if he didn’t want to pay attention to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu thickened his skin and continued to ask, “Is there a large number of top-grade herbs inside? How much will it cost?”

“Are you F * cking finding trouble? !”The guard seemed to be angered by Qin Yu and raised his hand to grab Qin Yu’s collar!

However, Qin Yu stretched out his hand and grabbed his wrist.

The guard’s expression changed. He tried to struggle, but he found that he could not break free.

“You have such a bad temper?”Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

The guard said angrily, “Let go of me immediately! Otherwise, don’t blame me for being rude!”

Just as he was about to flare up, the guard next to him suddenly leaned on his ear and whispered something.

After hearing his words, the guard’s expression changed slightly, and his tone immediately became much gentler.

He sized up Qin Yu and said, “What exactly do you want to ask?”

Qin Yu said, “I said, is there a large number of herbs inside? I need a large number of herbs now.”

The guard explained, “The herbs inside are not for sale.”

“Translator.”Qin Yu let go of the guard.

The guard rubbed his wrist and explained, “It’s like this. The herbs in here are all herbs sent by the sects and clans. These herbs are for alchemists.”

“Alchemists provide pills for the sects and clans, while the sects and clans provide herbs for alchemists. Among them, the Heavenly Cloud sect is the largest supplier.”

Qin Yu came to a sudden realization. He touched his chin and said, “In that case, it’s only the sects that keep this batch of alchemists. No wonder they are so overbearing.”

“You can put it that way.”The guard nodded.

Qin Yu continued to ask, “Then what are the quality of the herbs inside? What’s the difference between them and the outside world?”

“Of course it’s different,”the guard said with a smile.

“Let me put it this way. Most of the herbs outside were discarded by alchemists, so they were thrown outside.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but gasp.

10,000-year-old herbs were actually discarded by them?

This competition was really a waste of heaven’s gifts!

“Then how can I enter this place to become an alchemist?”Qin Yu asked impatiently.

The two of them looked at each other and said, “There’s a test. After the test, you can become an alchemist.”

Qin Yu immediately waved his hand and said, “Then don’t waste time. Arrange a test for me immediately! I want to become an alchemist.”

The guard said with a slightly troubled expression, “I’m afraid you’ll have to wait. This test is not up to us. We can only go and help you report it.”

“Then hurry up and go. I’ll wait for you here,”Qin Yu said with a smile.

The guard nodded repeatedly. One of them immediately turned around and walked into the palace. Qin Yu found a seat and sat down, quietly waiting.

In the palace.

Groups of alchemists were refining pills.

They were scattered on different levels. The alchemists on each level were different. The higher the level, the higher the level. and vice versa.

The herbs provided on each level were also very different. The herbs on the highest level could even meet a top-tier king of medicine that was 100,000 years old.

The guard shuttled all the way to the top level.

On the top level of the pagoda, there were a few old men refining pills.

Seeing the guard who barged in, the old men immediately frowned.

“Who let you in!”The old men berated angrily.

The guard hurriedly said, “Not good, something happened.”

“What happened? Why are you making such a fuss?”An old man with white hair and dressed in a white robe said indifferently.

This person was the president of this alchemist. He was nicknamed The Alchemist King.

“No matter what happened, get out quickly! You Don’t need to take responsibility for such a big matter.”Another old man shouted.

These people relied on the relationship between the various great clans and sects behind them. They were usually fearless and tyrannical.

At this moment, they naturally didn’t care at all.

“Let him speak.”At this moment, the alchemist King waved his hand.

The guard swallowed his saliva and said softly, “Qin Yu is here...”

When the few of them heard this, their expressions couldn’t help but change slightly.

“Qin Yu? What is he here for? Even Our Alchemist Sage has never had a grudge against him.”A trace of fear flashed across the face of an old man.

“What are you panicking for!”The Alchemist king shouted. He looked coldly at the guard and said, “Continue speaking. What is he doing here?”

The guard said, “Qin Yu said that he wants to enter the alchemist Sage Hall. He wants you to arrange a test...”

The moment these words were said, everyone present was shocked!

What? This Qin Yu actually wanted to enter the alchemist Sage Hall? He even wanted to pass the test?

“Could it be that this person is also an alchemist?”The Alchemist king asked with a frown.

The person beside him said in a low voice, “What should we do now? If we don’t make arrangements, he definitely won’t let this matter rest. But if we really let him join, I’m afraid that the Heavenly Cloud Sect... won’t agree...”
