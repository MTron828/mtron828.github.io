Chapter 1087: Chapter 1,087, the Treasure of the Sky Blood Rainbow 

“Ah! !”

Yan Jinyao’s pained roar spread throughout the entire Green Earth Park!

As a genius, being crippled of his cultivation was worse than being killed!

Not far away, Yan Sihai was furious, but he knew in his heart that he had no ability to take revenge at all!

He walked towards Yan Jinyao step by step with his aged steps.

Then, he hugged Yan Jinyao who was on the verge of breaking down.

“Qin Yu, you are so ruthless.”Yan Sihai looked at Qin Yu coldly, his eyes full of hatred.

Qin Yu said coldly, “If you dare to say another word, I will kill you.”

Yan Sihai was stunned. He didn’t say anything more. He hugged Yan Jinyao and returned to the car.

Yan Jinyao was crippled. No one had expected this outcome.

The genius who was known as the number one in the world had now become a cripple who could not cultivate. It could not help but cause people to sigh.

Qin Yu swept his gaze across the crowd and said coldly, “Anyone else who wants to attack me, feel free to do so.”

The surroundings were silent. No one dared to touch this brow.

Seeing this, Qin Yu did not say anything more. He turned around and left.

At this moment, in the second mystic realm, the handlebar mustache was digging something with a shovel.

A huge hole appeared in front of him. The hole was more than ten meters deep.

“HMM? I finally found it!”

At this moment, the moustache man’s eyes lit up.

He saw a jar placed in front of him. There was a strange internal Qi flowing inside the jar.

The moustache man carried the jar and climbed out of the hole.

He looked at the jar up and down and muttered, “What is this thing? Why haven’t I seen it before?”

“Don’t touch it!”

At this moment, Tian Xuehong’s figure appeared not far away!

The mustached man glanced at Tian Xuehong and muttered, “Tian Xuehong? Why are you here?”

Tian Xuehong did not have the time to pay attention to the mustached man. He nervously looked at the jar in the mustached man’s hand and carefully said, “That thing is useless to you. Give it to me...”

“Give it to you? What kind of joke is this? I almost died of exhaustion digging this broken jar,”the handlebar mustache muttered.

Tian Xuehong’s expression changed. He patiently said, “That thing is really of no use to you. How about this? Give it to me and I can use something to exchange for it with you. Anything Is Fine!”

“Anything Is Fine? Really?”The handlebar mustache said with slight surprise.

Tian Xuehong hurriedly nodded and said, “Really! I have many treasures on me!”

The man with the handlebar mustache stroked his beard and said, “How about this? You give me a magic tool of a great cultivator transcending the tribulation, and I’ll return it to you. How about it?”

The veins on Tian Xuehong’s forehead twitched violently. He gritted his teeth and said, “Are you kidding me? !”

The man with the handlebar mustache muttered, “You said it yourself. Anything is fine. Since you don’t have it, don’t boast.”

Tian Xuehong forcefully suppressed the anger in his heart, he said, “Even if a great cultivator at the tribulation stage searched the entire universe, there wouldn’t be many magic artifacts! I can give you a great power magic artifact. Although it’s damaged, it still has the power of a great power. How about it?”

“No.”The moustache man refused without even thinking.

“Why don’t you give me a tribulation transcending pill? That thing is pretty good.”

“F * ck you!”Tian Xuehong finally couldn’t hold it in anymore.

“Are you F * cking kidding me? !”

The mustached man sneered, “You’re really a fool. You only realized it now? Although I don’t know what this thing is, since you’re so nervous, it must be something extraordinary. You want to take it back? Dream On!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“You’re courting death!”Tian Xuehong was extremely furious. His body turned into a stream of light and rushed toward the mustached man.

However, the handlebar mustache was as slippery as a loach. In the blink of an eye, it had fled several hundred meters.

“Back then, even several dozen mighty figures couldn’t stop me, let alone you? In terms of escaping, this venerable self says that I’m number two. No one dares to say that I’m number one!”The handlebar mustache said with a smile.

“You! Return the thing to me!”The Heavenly Blood Rainbow’s eyes were wide open. He wanted nothing more than to slaughter the handlebar mustache!

Inside the jar was the divine sense of the more than 10,000 martial marquis!

As long as he obtained this item, the sky blood rainbow would be able to recover more than half of his strength. At that time, he would definitely be invincible in the world!

However, he had never expected that a handlebar mustache would appear out of nowhere!

“Stop Dreaming.”The handlebar mustache said with a smile.

“Come, continue chasing after me. Qin Yu will probably come back in a while. Let’s chat in detail when he comes back.”

Tian Xuehong’s expression changed drastically!

In his current state, he was no match for Qin Yu. He would probably die in Qin Yu’s hands in a single exchange!

“You... I will remember you!”Tian Xuehong gritted his teeth.

Although he really wanted to take back the jar, his life was clearly more important than his life.

“I will wait for you,”the mustached man said with a smile.

The Heavenly Blood Rainbow Glared at the mustached man angrily, then turned around and left.

A few minutes after he left the second mystic realm, Qin Yu rushed back to the second mystic realm.

The moment he saw Qin Yu, the mustached man immediately rushed over.

“Qin Yu, this venerable one has a babe in my hand. Do you want it?”The mustached man said with a smile.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “What Babe?”

The mustached man said mysteriously, “I don’t know what it is. It’s a babe that the heavenly blood rainbow wants to take back.”

“The Heavenly Blood Rainbow came here?”Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

“That’s right. But he was beaten away by me and took his Babe,”the mustached man said proudly.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly.

Babe? There was probably only one treasure that the Sky Blood Rainbow wanted to retrieve after running to the second secret realm! That was the divine sense absorbed by the eight light pillars!

The divine sense of more than ten thousand martial Marquis was enough to allow Qin Yu to step into a new realm!

“Tell me, what do you want?”Thinking of this, Qin Yu couldn’t wait to look at the mustached man.
