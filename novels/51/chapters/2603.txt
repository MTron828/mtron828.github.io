Chapter 2604: The Showdown Battle

Su Xinghe said quietly.

The two looked at each other and saw the bitterness on each other’s faces. “Everyone, gather at the general’s residence. The general has a mission to announce.”

While Qin Yu was cultivating, a cold voice sounded before him. A soldier had arrived at some point in time.

Moreover, this time, it was the soldier of the commando team. The aura was even more terrifying.

Even if Qin Yu had just obtained a new skill, he felt he was not a match for this soldier.

Being able to withstand that world-shattering spell with a physical body, it could not be just an ordinary martial artist.

They arrived at a hil?e house where the qeneral’s residence was located.

Compared to ordinary houses, it only had an additional one or two levels and was slightly bigger.

At this moment, it was full of people standing in an organized manner.

Judging from their attire, these people should belong to the army’s upper echelons, including all the outsiders.

It seemed that after the last battle, outsiders still came over. There were nearly twenty outsiders here.

These people had different expressions, and it was unclear what thoughts were running through their minds.

Arriving in this Nine Tune City was like being driven by an unseen force. Other than Yin Lin, who joined the enemy previously, Qin Yu guessed that all had to help defend the city.

Otherwise, they, along with this city, would likely be wiped out

The terrifying erasing power rang out, and Qin Yu could not help but shiver.

“Everyone, I don’t have much time to live. After breaking the altar, Selfer’s strength has caused severe damage to my body. I can feel that my strength is getting increasingly weaker. If I wait any longer, I’m afraid I won’t even be able to lift my sword.”

Lu Liefeng coughed, and a fine mist of blood spewed from his mouth.

“Three days later, I will lead you all to fight a life-and-death battle against Seifer. Please prepare yourselves.”

Lu Liefeng stabbed his blade into the floor.

Qin Yu’s mind buzzed. Fighting to the death with Saifu, wasn’t it a joke?

“General Liefeng, fighting a life-and-death battle isn’t a good choice. You are the only one here who can resist Seifer. If you die, Seifer’s ogre army is sufficient to kill everyone.”

An outsider suddenly said. He was a human race, but no one knew whose will he represented.

Lu Liefeng coughed and ignored him.

The other soldiers left the General’s Mansion in an orderly manner. At this moment, only outsiders like them were left in the enormous hall of the general’s residence.

“What a headache! I wouldn’t have redeemed all the military merits if I had known earlier. Some information exchanges will cost military merits.”

Lu Yue, the young man with a buzz cut who had spoken earlier, had a solemn expression. He raised his head and said to everyone.

“Everyone, there’s a high chance we will be wiped out if we can’t defend this city. At this moment, we need to work together to overcome this crisis.”

Qin Yu looked at the young man in surprise. This person’s analysis was not much different from his.

“Do you have any solution? That necromancer’s power is simply too great. I’m afraid that with just one technique, the twenty of us will be reduced to ashes.” The other person shook his head.

Even those who came here were with outstanding talents and lofty aspirations.

After seeing for themselves Seifer’s power, no one dared to refute him. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Other than a few living beings of the demon race with unfriendly expressions, the rest were all from the human race. This should be the rightful distribution of this Saint Kingdom.

Otherwise, it would be very strange for the demonic cultivators to guard the city of the human race.

“If it’s a dead end, let this heaven and earth wipe us out. There’s no need to kill us in such a way. Previously, I used all the merit points I obtained from killing to obtain some information. Perhaps there’s a powerful force in the bunker that can help us, a powerful imprisoned living being, or something else. However, this seems to be a taboo.”

The buzz-cut young man said.

“Does anyone have military merits? Ask Li Liefei how to get into the bunker.

This might be our only chance of survival. Otherwise, with our strength alone, we will definitely die without any external help. Of course, if we can get the information, we’ll split the merit points consumed equally.”

“Hmph, you ask him yourself. My merit points have long been exchanged for the things in the storage room.”

A living being of the demon said coldly and walked out of the general’s residence with the other two living beings of the demon race.

After that, six living beings of the human race left. These people probably felt that the buzz-cut young man’s words were unreliable and did not want to waste time here.

“I think what he said makes sense. Previously, I received an invitation from Seifer. His power invaded this city and successfully made a demon join him. I doubt if he was so powerful, why would he need to make so many arrangements? Perhaps there is a way to restrain him here.”

Qin Yu was a little surprised. This person was different from him.

He actually found out about this through his own analysis.

It included the things in the bunker. If Elder Tianji had not told him, he would not have thought of this information. Moreover, the person actually forewent all his military merits to exchange for the information here. This made Qin Yu think highly of him.

These people were not fools. After Lu Yue pointed out and coupled with Qin Yu’s information, they could judge many things now. They indeed felt what Lu

Yue said made sense.

In the face of such a deadly battle, some people started to compromise.

“Just ask Li Liefei how to get to the bunker! Don’t ask any other questions. It will consume your merit points.” There was no reaction.

Many had gone to probe but turned back.

As the number of people decreased, Qin Yu’s expression became increasingly uglier.

“D*mn it, I killed four giant ogres and many ogres, but I still can’t go to the bunker?”

With the last person encountering a setback again, the expressions of everyone became tremendously unpleasant.

“If these merit points are still insufficient, it means this bunker is shocking enough. We’ll have to take out a vast amount of merit points to enter this mysterious bunker.”

Lu Yue said with a bitter smile.

Qin Yu also nodded. It was just like the first dao lecture that depleted his merit points for protecting the villagers of the tribe.

“Qin Yu, Ju Wuwei, Lu Yue, Liu Da, and Fang Xiang, the five of you will follow the scouts out of the city tonight to investigate the enemy’s military deployment and the details of the enemy’s camp. It would be best if you could get news of Seifer to prepare for the battle in three days.”

What?

Instantly, Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically.

Their strength to probe the enemy’s camp was no different from sending themselves to death.

Earlier, when he was only 500 meters away, he stole a glance at Seifer, and it almost burned his soul into ashes..
