Chapter 1103: Chapter 1,013, Xiao Yuan’s strength 

The people in front of him were walking towards Qin Yu with cold faces.

Qin Yu was extremely puzzled and couldn’t help but shout, “What on Earth happened!”

However, these people still ignored Qin Yu. They walked towards Qin Yu step by step, their bodies emitting a cold chill.

Could it be that... these people wanted to join hands to kill Qin Yu?

“Chang Mang?”Qin Yu subconsciously looked at Chang Mang.

However, Chang Mang was very different from the past. His thick and sturdy body was exuding a strong killing intent.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly and said coldly, “You are not the real person at all. Could it be that this is an illusion? Or is it some kind of strange spell?”

Qin Yu could not trust the others, but he could not not trust Chang Mang.

This person’s nature was simple, and he would definitely not do anything that would betray him.

“Boom!”

At this moment, Chang Mang’s body emitted a red radiance as he clenched his fist and charged towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu shouted, “Alright, I was just about to experience everyone’s brilliant moves. Come!”

Without saying a word, his entire body emitted Golden Flames as he clenched his fist and charged towards Chang Mang!

“Clang!”

A loud explosion sounded at this moment. Both of them had strong and fierce bodies, and their bodies were almost evenly matched when they collided!

Both of them took a few steps back. Qin Yu shook his fist and felt pain in his arm.

“This kid’s body is really not worth it!”Qin Yu could not help but exclaim.

It was also at this moment that the other people also made their moves!

Chang Mang clenched his fist and headed straight for Qin Yu’s glabella.

Yao Meng’s hand was dyed with holy light, and her every move was like a divine rainbow.

Kong Yun grabbed the long spear and pierced through the sky.

Xiao Yuan, on the other hand, was hidden in the thick fog. His palm sent down an incomparably heavy light that crushed over.

“Internal Qi!”Qin Yu roared furiously. His aura erupted to the limit as he faced these people!

“Boom!”

The Divine Rainbow that Yao Meng extended out of her palm forced Qin Yu back. It seemed like a gentle light, but it contained an extremely powerful force.

The long spear in Kong Yun’s hand stabbed out hundreds of times in the blink of an eye, forcing Qin Yu back.

Xiao Yuan’s heavy radiance was even more mysterious and unfathomable, making it difficult for Qin Yu to take a step.

“Puchi!”

Kong Yun’s long spear pierced into Qin Yu’s upper arm, and blood splattered on his body.

Qin Yu roared angrily and took the opportunity to grab Kong Yun’s long spear. Then, he exploded with brute force, forcefully breaking the long spear into two pieces. A suction force caught Kong Yun, and then his palm exploded with brilliance, shaking Kong Yun until he vanished into thin air!

At the same time, Yao Meng’s thousands of Divine Rainbows had already shot over, leaving Qin Yu with nowhere to hide.

Qin Yu did not dare to be negligent. He activated his green wood true body and simultaneously threw out a punch that broke through ten thousand arts, shattering the myriad of brilliance!

The more Qin Yu fought, the more alarmed he became. These people usually seemed gentle, but the power they erupted with was incomparably shocking!

“As expected of a genius!”Qin Yu could not help but shout.

The battle continued, and Qin Yu revealed all his trump cards. He threw out a punch that broke ten thousand arts, shattering many afterimages.

He and Chang Mang used their physical bodies to meet head-on. This terrifying qi energy shook all directions, causing the entire world to seem as if it was about to collapse!

“Boom!”

Fortunately, Chang Mang didn’t have any spells to support him. Under a punch that broke ten thousand arts, his physical body was ultimately shattered!

In the blink of an eye, Xiao Yuan was the only one left in front of him.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s body was already covered in blood. There were more than ten bloody holes on his body.

This was enough to show the anxiety of this battle. It was also enough to show the abilities of these elite disciples!

Xiao Yuan’s hand held the light. His every move reflected the sun and moon. The mysterious and unfathomable power made Qin Yu feel as if there was a ray of light on his back.

“You are indeed not simple!”Qin Yu could not help but Shout!

Although he could not sense Xiao Yuan’s internal Qi, the way he held the Sun and the Moon with his hand was very similar to that of a deity.

The power on his palm was even more strange. The Sun and the Moon revolved in his palm.

His internal Qi was like a waterfall, falling on the ground and instantly pressing down on the ground.

At this moment, Xiao Yuan looked extremely sacred. Although he was gentle and refined, his every movement was full of killing intent!

“Weng!”

Finally, Xiao Yuan made his move.

He raised his palm forward, and the sun and moon instantly came crushing over!

An incomparably heavy force seemed to want to crush this entire world!

Even Qin Yu’s body was currently emitting cracking sounds, as if he was about to be crushed into meat paste! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Ah!”

Qin Yu roared, and the internal Qi of his entire body was unleashed to the limit. He clenched his fist and broke through all methods with a single punch!

“Boom!”

A punch landed on the sun and Moon. The Sun and moon only shook slightly!

This shocked Qin Yu greatly!

What kind of spell was this? It was actually so powerful!

Qin Yu did not dare to think too much. He clenched his fist again and stood up.

“Clang! Clang! Clang!”

Three consecutive golden fists. This power was so strong that it could destroy even a secret realm!

However, Xiao Yuan’s sun and Moon realm was not affected. It was still charging toward Qin Yu!

Qin Yu could not help but have a cold expression on his face.

Regardless of realm or strength, Qin Yu was not weaker than Xiao Yuan.

The anxiety at this moment was enough to prove that the spells in Xiao Yuan’s hands were not ordinary.

“Just based on spells, he definitely can not reach such a realm,”Qin Yu muttered coldly as he retreated.

For him to possess such strength, he must have obtained some extremely powerful and terrifying inheritance!

As the sun and Moon realm crushed over, Qin Yu no longer thought about it. He immediately used his infinity Dharma Idol and grabbed the sun and Moon realm with both of his arms, pulling it into his embrace!

The Infinity Dharma Idol was a true heaven rank spell, incomparably terrifying. There were very few people in the world who had learned this spell, and it was not inferior to any top secret arts!

In addition to the powerful explosion of Qin Yu’s unique constitution, cracks finally appeared on the Sun and Moon Realm in Qin Yu’s arms!

“Ah!”

Qin Yu roared repeatedly, and the veins on his arms bulged. The golden light completely shattered the fog!

“Crack!”

Finally, the sun and Moon realm exploded in Qin Yu’s arms!

At the same time, Qin Yu took a step forward, and his huge fist smashed towards Xiao Yuan!

Rolling might shot out explosively like a dragon, and this force could melt everything. Xiao Yuan’s figure sank into it and instantly vanished into thin air!
