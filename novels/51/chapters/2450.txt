2451 God-Slaying Dusk

The space within ten thousand miles of Evil Eye suddenly brightened up.

Some ghost races had never seen how it looked like during the day. They were stunned and seemed like they had seen a miracle.

The sky turned dim yellow in a few breaths.

The setting sun was like blood, indicating that dusk had arrived.

The ghostly sword emitted the light of the setting sun.

Where the light covered, the leaves were yellow, and the air seemed bleak.

After that, a destructive force suddenly rippled from the human race’s sea of the Path of Heaven.

That power rushed into Evil Eye, causing its power to fuse again, giving off an even more fatal internal qi.

The black power of annihilation was the power that Qin Yu was most familiar with. This was the method he used to survive in purgatory.

However, after he returned to the Holy Region, he had not been able to discover the location of the Path of Heaven.

At this moment, that power turned into a demonic dragon burning with black fire, letting out a crazy roar.

It was as if venting its anger that no one had been able to sense its anger for so many years.

As the black dragon completely entered Evil Eye, the color of the setting sun became ten thousand times darker.

The third move, I call it the God-Slaying Dusk.

Qin Yu stared at King Qin Guang indifferently.

At this moment, he had even forgotten who the person before him was. He only knew that this slash was very crucial to him.

The sword energy slashed out, and with the sword energy as the center, the kingdom of dust descended.

A sad song sounded. As soon as this sword was unleashed, the entire space seemed to be playing with sad music.

Before the sword energy arrived, the lingering lights of the setting sun had left countless deep wounds on King Qin Guang’s body.

His soul even had a sorrowful illusion as if the end of the world was about to descend.

He did not understand why Qin Yu, initially like a flickering candle in the wind, could suddenly release such a terrifying sword slash.

With the power of the Yellow Springs primordial rune, it was impossible to block the power of this ghostly sword.

He raised his hands high, and two massive thunderbolts struck down. Two magic artifacts instantly appeared in his hands.

Book of Life and Death!

The Judge’s Brush!

These two magical artifacts carried the internal qi of the power of the Path of Heaven. In an instant, it was as if there were two more spatial planes.

The Book of Life and Death blocked the lingering light of the setting sun like a shield.

A sorrowful cry filled between heaven and earth, and countless images slowly appeared in the sorrowful kingdom.

Over there, there were exceptionally formidable Immortal Emperors of the human race, the emperors of the ghost race, the experts of the demon race, and even countless living beings who were cultivating.

These people fell one by one. In the end, dusk disappeared, and everyone was gone.

There was only one sword left, the God-slaying Dusk.

It was the ultimate destruction, the disaster of all the utmost powerful beings.

This move seemed to be a sword move but also a forewarning.

King Qin Guang’s mind was instantly shaken. For the first time, his calm soul had some fear.

“Boom!” The Judge’s Brush in King Qin Guang’s hand turned into a giant sword of heaven and earth, and he thrust it toward the kingdom of dusk.

A terrifying power erupted from his body. In an instant, even the power of every cell in his body was squeezed out by him and entered the Judge’s Brush.

The Judge’s Brush! The brush that controlled life and death emitted a terrifying divine light instantly.

A vast life and death qi instantly pierced out.

A ray of light appeared in the middle of the kingdom of dusk. The light pierced through the kingdom and hit Qin Yu’s soul.

It did not stop after that. The internal qi kept breaking through the ghost realm.

In the tremendously distant universe plane, it slowly calmed down.

The Judge’s Brush and the God-slaying Dusk disappeared almost simultaneously. The entire ghost realm was so quiet that it was so terrifying.

King Qin Guang’s body trembled, and in the end, he could not take it anymore and knelt on the ground.

He might have fallen to the ground if the Judge’s Brush did not support his chest.

The difference in strength between him and King Qin Guang was too big. In addition, the Judge’s Brush was a magical artifact that contained the power of the Path of Heaven.

This attack pierced through his soul and even severely injured most of his soul origin.

He looked at a person in the distance.

He did not know why. Although he had forgotten many things at that moment, he just wanted to go over to see him.

Every step Qin Yu took was tremendously difficult. These were the last steps he took with the power of his soul. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Finally, he reached.

This person’s face appeared before him, but he could not remember it at all.

Although he only had a trace of his soul power left, he still felt an inexplicable sense of familiarity with this person.

“Brother Xiao Hai?”

He felt that he had called out this unfamiliar name for no reason, and then Qin Yu’s vision went black.

He wanted to grab Xiao Hai’s arm, but at the last moment, he had used up all his strength.

Qin Yu’s palm brushed past the child’s arm by an inch, and then he lost consciousness and fell to the ground.

In these few breaths, countless images flashed across Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

These were the most important moments in his life. The few breaths before he completely disappeared, these memories filled his mind like a replay.

“I’m sorry, Ruoxue. I can’t go back.”

In the end, the scene froze on the visage of a young girl.

Qin Yu’s soul turned into countless specks of light and dissipated in space. Like fireflies, it slowly disappeared into the distance, becoming smaller and smaller.

Xiao Hai stretched out his hands and watched as the speck of light passed through his palms and slowly disappeared into the void.

“What a pity. If you could survive, it might be a tremendous variable. This ending is a good thing for the ghost realm.”

Countless living beings came to the netherworld every day.

For K?itigarbha to say this, he had already acknowledged Qin Yu’s weight.

After so many ghost years, he could only take a fancy to these three people.

The third sword move had indeed shocked him, but he was facing the first Yama, King Qin Guang.

With a tap of his body, he turned into countless black soul snakes and disappeared in front of Xiao Hai.

Originally, he had wanted to make a bet with Xiao Hai, but now that the chips were gone, the bet no longer existed.

All of a sudden, the soul snake came to a halt and returned to Xiao Hai.

K?itigarbha seemed to be in disbelief. At this moment, a vast ghost qi appeared above Xiao Hai’s head.

In the long river of ghostly qi, countless primordial runes flickered in it.

The moment this long river appeared, all the living beings in the ghost realm felt a terrifying deterrence.

Even King Qin Guang lowered his head, unable to look at the river of the Path of Heaven of the ghost race.

This long river was the true body of the Path of Heaven of the ghost race, and it was a power of order that was much more terrifying than the primordial rune.

“Are you sure you want to do this?”

K?itigarbha Bodhisattva seemed to be in disbelief.

At this moment, an uncountable number appeared in Xiao Hai’s soul.

That was all the merit points he had accumulated since he came to the ghost realm.
