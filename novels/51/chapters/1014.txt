Chapter 1015: Chapter 1,015. A martial saint was not worth mentioning 

The broadsword was shattered in the blink of an eye.

Li Ziqi could not take it anymore. His body went limp and he fell to the ground!

Not far away, the pavilion master’s beautiful eyes widened!

This almost invincible technique was actually so weak in front of Qin Yu?

Was this Qin Yu who had stepped into the martial saint realm? Indeed, he lived up to his reputation!

“Do you have any other techniques?”Qin Yu’s feet shook and he instantly appeared in front of Li Ziqi.

Li Ziqi was already scared out of his wits. With a “Plop”sound, he knelt on the ground and begged desperately, “I... I was wrong... I was wrong... spare me, spare my dog life...”

Li Ziqi’s tears flowed down his face and he cried like a child.

No one would have thought that an invincible martial saint would be so humble at this moment.

Qin Yu looked down at Li Ziqi with disdain in his eyes.

“As long as you spare me... I’m willing to be your slave. Please spare me...”Li Ziqi begged desperately.

Qin Yu said coldly, “You’re just an ant. You Don’t even have the qualifications to be your slave.”

After he finished speaking, Qin Yu slowly raised his palm and placed it on Li Ziqi’s forehead.

“Ah! ! !”

In an instant, Li Ziqi only felt his primordial spirit being forcefully pulled out!

His divine sense was lifted into the air by Qin Yu’s golden light with one hand.

“No, no! !”Li Ziqi roared like a madman!

However, at this moment, Qin Yu no longer had any compassion. With a golden flash, he directly sucked that primordial spirit into his body!

Qin Yu, who had become a martial saint, did not even need to use the heaven swallowing technique to instantly absorb the martial saint’s primordial spirit!

Although they were both martial saints, the gap between them was like a natural chasm!

After killing Li Ziqi, Qin Yu’s heart did not waver at all.

It was as if he had accidentally stepped on an ant.

Qin Yu ignored Li Ziqi’s corpse. He turned around and returned to the front of the pavilion master. He said quietly, “Pavilion Master, you have suffered.”

The pavilion master kept shaking his head and said, “Qin Yu, you... you’re even more powerful than I imagined.”

“Yes.”Qin Yu nodded.

“Even I didn’t expect that after becoming a martial saint, I would have such power.”

No wonder they had risked their lives to stop Qin Yu from becoming a martial saint.

It was because after Qin Yu became a martial saint, it would be a blow to the lower dimension!

“Oh right, where is Senior Xiang?”At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

Pavilion master quickly said, “He was sent flying by Li Ziqi’s palm strike.”

Qin Yu nodded and immediately released his divine sense to quickly find Xiang Danqing’s figure.

In the next second, Qin Yu’s figure disappeared. A few seconds later, he returned to the front of Pavilion Master.

He was still holding the unconscious Xiang Danqing in his arms.

“Fortunately, he didn’t die.”The pavilion master glanced at Xiang Danqing and shook his head.

Qin Yu placed one hand on Xiang Danqing’s body, and wisps of spirit Qi poured into it.

A few minutes later, Xiang Danqing opened his eyes in a daze.

He looked around in a daze, as if he had lost his memory.

“What happened?”Xiang Danqing rubbed his eyes.

When he clearly saw the scene in front of him, he seemed to have suddenly remembered something.

“Where is that martial saint? He wants to kill you!”Xiang Danqing said with a hint of fear.

“Alright, he has already been killed by Qin Yu.”The pavilion master held his forehead with a hint of helplessness.

Xiang Danqing was stunned. Then, he said in a shocked voice, “You... you have become a martial saint?”

“Yes, I was lucky to succeed.”Qin Yu said with a smile.

“That’s good, that’s good...”Xiang Danqing heaved a sigh of relief.

“It’s a pity that I didn’t get to see you make a move. I also don’t know how strong you are after you’ve become a martial saint.”Xiang Danqing said with some regret.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “It’s Alright, Senior. There will be many opportunities in the future.”

“When I’ve leveled the second secret area, I’ll invite you to go and visit it.”

His words were extremely calm.

However, the arrogance within the calmness was extremely shocking.

However, at this moment, pavilion master did not doubt the authenticity of Qin Yu’s words.

“Seniors, please wait for me for a moment.”Qin Yu bowed slightly and said.

After saying that, he turned around and walked back to the front of the heavenly tribulation.

This place was still a sea of lightning. Even if Qin Yu successfully transcended the heavenly tribulation, he still did not show any signs of disappearing. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

As he stared at this sea of lightning, Qin Yu’s mind stirred. The spatial divine artifact immediately began to flash with light!

Qin Yu had actually stored this sea of lightning into the spatial divine artifact!

Pavilion master and Xiang Danqing couldn’t help but look at each other in dismay!

“A spatial divine artifact can be used in this manner?”Xiang Danqing felt that it was inconceivable.

Qin Yu turned around and walked back. He said with a smile, “An ordinary spatial divine artifact is naturally impossible, but this is a spatial prison.”

A spatial prison used to imprison a supreme being at the peak of the supreme being realm would naturally be able to absorb this sea of lightning.

“Qin Yu, why are you collecting this sea of lightning?”Pavilion master asked.

Qin Yu glanced at the spatial divine weapon and said, “This thing is a great killing weapon. Even an ordinary martial saint wouldn’t be able to withstand it.”

“When I attack the second secret realm, it will have a magical effect.”

“At the same time, I will use this sea of lightning to set up a mountain protecting formation.”

Pavilion master was slightly surprised.

He seemed to be surprised by Qin Yu’s strange ideas.

“What are your plans next? Return to Jingdu?”Pavilion master asked.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and shook his head: “No, now is not the time.”

Pavilion master and Xiang Danqing looked at each other, seemingly confused.

Qin Yu explained: “I am now infamous within the fire country’s martial world, and I am known to be a notorious pyro.”

“No matter what I do, it will cause them to revile me. So now is not the time to return.”

“At the same time, we still need to make some preparations to attack the second mystic realm.”

This preparation was naturally referring to the heaven gate.

To Qin Yu, the flourishing country was an extremely precious resource.

There were countless top experts gathered there. If all of them could be integrated, then this force would be at the top in the entire world!

“I want to lead the army to flatten the second mystic realm,”Qin Yu said coldly.
