2516 Master Makes a Move

2518

“Master, you can help me. His current condition is not worthy of my move.”

Si Shiyue said lightly, completely disregarding Qin Yu.

With his current vision, he could tell at a glance that Qin Yu’s body was worlds apart from previously.

Revered Qi, Su Xinghe, and the loli watched all of this and did not stop them.

“If we’re talking about how a human race genius like Xiao Hai could become a member of the ghost race, your Si family is the main culprit, especially you, Si Liuhe.”

Qin Yu stared at Si Liuhe, who was getting up and said coldly.

“That’s right. Xiao Hai died in my hands. So what if I personally captured him and killed him?”

Si Liuhe placed his hands behind his back and released a powerful internal qi.

The surrounding people consciously gave up their space, leaving only Si Liuhe and Qin Yu in the center.

Si Liuhe was also a genius, belonging to the top talented people along with Yan Tianshi, Yan Guyun, Dean Lei, and others, and perhaps even surpassing them.

At the True Saint Realm, he relied on being the number one person to kill Xuan Jizi forcefully.

He was only one step behind when fighting against a veteran cultivator like Dean Lei.

At this moment, his strength had already advanced beyond the fifth level. Although there was still a gap between his and Qin Yu’s strength, Qin Yu’s physical body had not recovered from the severe injuries. His physical body right now had just condensed.

Therefore, Si Liuhe was not afraid of Qin Yu at all.

“Si Liuhe, I’ll make you understand today the difference between you, me, and Xiao Hai.”

Qin Yu said coldly as he walked toward Si Liuhe.

“Qin Yu’s talent is also considered among the top of the human race. Are you sure you must force him to this extent?”

Su Xinghe frowned.

“Can you clear the doubts I raised? If not, how can you dispel my worries? If he breaks through that limit by the betraying path of anomaly, what should we, the human race, do?”

“All of you have encountered the sixth-level bewilderment. If he accepts the power of the alien race and chooses to become the son of the alien race like He Teng, can you stop him? If the human race was at its peak, there’s nothing wrong with it. But at this point, I disagree if you want to gamble on his choice.”

The sixth-level bewilderment was their most dreadful nightmare during their breakthrough beyond the fifth level.

At this stage, they could now attract the attention of the power of the Path of Heaven, especially those who walked the path of anomaly. As long as they accepted the bewitchment of the power of the alien race’s Path of Heaven, they could become the most powerful divine weapon of the alien race.

That would be the nightmare of the human race. Si Shiyue was right. The higher the barrier beyond the fifth level, the more tempted they would be by that power. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Especially nearing the breakthrough, that stage where it seemed within reach yet remained elusive could drive one to madness.

In the past years of the Path of Heaven, when the human race was flourishing, there were many records of people bewitched by the power of the Path of Heaven of the alien races and betrayed the human race.

“I still insist on my opinion. Let the juniors settle it themselves then…”

Su Xinghe sighed. Even if he was dissatisfied, he could not attack Revered Qi.

If the three top-notch martial artists of the human race were to have another internal conflict, there was no need to fight this battle of the race anymore. They could surrender straight away.

Letting Si Shiyue and Qin Yu settle it themselves was actually a tacit understanding between them to take a step back.

However, it was very obvious that this hundred-year agreement was tremendously unfair to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu was dressed in white. He looked at Si Liuhe who was emitting a terrifying internal qi.

He felt like he was revisiting history. At that time, it was him, Yan Tianshi, and the others who captured and suppressed him and Yan Ruoxue just as they were about to leave the Holy Region.

For nearly a hundred years, he hadn’t even seen Yan Ruoxue once.

“Roaming Dragon.”

Si Liuhe bent his feet slightly, and a golden power ran through his head.

The power of origin of gold surged into his body from the throne in the void.

With a shake of his calf, his body arrived before Qin Yu.

His movements were smooth and elegant as if he was dancing in the valley.

His palms were like dragon claws that instantly pierced through the wind and attacked Qin Yu with a trace of wind and lightning.

In an instant, the entire space was full of dragon roars and violent winds.

Si Liuhe’s arms seemed to have turned into dragon shadows with each palm strike.

A terrifying force crashed directly into Qin Yu’s body. He dared not delay and chose the tactic of close combat straight away.

This way, even if it was a rebound force, it was not something Qin Yu’s current body could withstand.

Amid the palm shadows that filled the sky, an enormous figure suddenly appeared behind him.

His soul power transformed into numerous fists and fiercely smashed toward the palm shadows that filled the sky.

This speed was like a hundred times slow motion in front of Qin Yu’s terrifying divine sense.

It almost posed no threat to him.

“Whoosh!”

Golden Sun Flag!

Wood Spirit Flag!

Water Wave Flag!

Flame Flag!

Earth Mist Flag!

Si Liuhe landed hard on the ground, and five beams of light shot out to a distant place from the ground.

Even Qin Yu found it hard to grasp this power in an instant. In an instant, the five chess pieces split into five directions and plunged deep into the void.

In an instant, the vital energy of the five elements between heaven and earth seemed to have become dozens of times denser.

Dense vital energy rushed toward this area frantically. A strong wind blew in the sky, and a violent spiritual rain instantly poured.

“It’s the Si family’s celestial artifact, the Five Elements Flag. Grandmaster Si is going to use his real technique!”

Someone in the surroundings said.

“Startled Stillness.”

Si Liuhe raised his left hand, and a heavy saber appeared in the air as if being summoned.

It was as if a mountain had crashed down. The ground shook violently, and a fine crack slowly extended from where the heavy saber had landed.

Si Liuhe held the Startled Stillness in his hand and pointed the blade at Qin Yu coldly.

A saber intent dense enough to oppress mountains and rivers swept out, and the heavy saber descended toward Qin Yu.

It was like a mountain descending. Qin Yu closed his eyes.

Under the Spiritualization Technique, he again accurately received the saber with both palms.

When the heavy mountain saber descended, not even his robes fluttered.

“What a terrifying soul power! I wonder how he could cultivate his power of divine sense to such a level!”

Teng Zixu narrowed his eyes and realized it was not that Si Liuhe was not strong.

It was Qin Yu who had used the soul materializing technique that the soul power directly suppressed Si Liuhe.

“I’ll give you one more chance to attack.”

The giant behind Qin Yu slightly bent his finger and flicked Startled Stillness back.

“Arrogant!”

Si Liuhe took a deep breath and suddenly closed his eyes.

The power of the Five Elements Flag pierced his body like a sharp sword, and the terrifying power lifted his body.

The power of the five elements complemented and countered each other.

When the five elements were put together, tens of thousands of changes were derived.

A terrifying amount of blood flowed out of Si Liuhe’s seven orifices. His power seemed to have injured him badly.
