1767 The Scary Stubbornness

“Xiao Sheng, don’t be too arrogant!” The mysterious man shouted from behind.

However, Xiao Sheng ignored him. He turned around and left the Cultivation Mountain.

That incident happened because of Qin Yu, and it was a hidden danger.

However, Xiao Sheng did not intend to tell Qin Yu about this.

After all, Xiao Sheng’s Dao was to facing Death with calm, and he was never afraid.

He arrived at the Dayue Mountain.

At this moment, Qin Yu looked even weaker.

His primordial spirit flickered and dimmed, as if he was about to leave the world at any moment.

Jue Wu and the others were with him, not knowing what to do. They could only pin their hopes on Xiao Sheng.

“Xiao Sheng!”

They hurried over when they saw him.

“How is it? Is there a way?” Jue Wu impatiently asked.

Xiao Sheng ignored her and walked to Qin Yu’s side, then took out the pill. He made Qin Yu swallow it with his spiritual power.

After feeding the pill, Xiao Sheng moved to the side.

“What is this?” Someone asked.

“I don’t know, but it can save his life,” said Xiao Sheng, shooting him a glance.

As they were talking, Qin Yu began to recover.

His primordial spirit seemed to have been repaired, but it was not very strong.

As the mysterious man had said, it would take a long time for his primordial spirit to fully recover.

The people stood around Qin Yu’s bed, feeling anxious.

After two hours, Qin Yu finally moved.

He slowly opened his eyes. He felt the world spinning around him, and it was extremely uncomfortable.

Soon, Qin Yu felt that his stomach was in turmoil, and then he vomited.

Having not eaten for days, he only vomited some water.

“Qin Yu, you’ve finally woken up!” Jue Wu and the others quickly came over.

Qin Yu rubbed his head, feeling a sharp pain. He was miserable.

He looked at the people around him and asked with a frown, “What’s going on?”

“Don’t talk. We’ll tell you later,” Qu Zhu said.

“I’m fine now,” Qin Yu shook his head and said, ” Just tell me.”

Qu Zhu was silent for a moment, and then he told Qin Yu everything that had happened lately.

Hearing Qu Zhu’s words, Qin Yu was surprised. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“You said… He Teng killed Yuan Xiu?” Qin Yu frowned.

Qu Zhu nodded and continued, “Before he left, he said that he would have a battle with you in the future.”

Qin Yu remained silent. Even though he knew that He Teng was extremely sinister and cunning, he had never expected that he would kill Yuan Xiu.

“No matter who killed him, Yuan Xiu is finally dead,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

At this moment, Xiao Sheng walked over.

He waved his hand. “You guys leave us alone. I have something to say to him.”

The others didn’t argue. After this battle, they had some trust in Xiao Sheng.

Soon, only Qin Yu and Xiao Sheng were left in the room.

Xiao Sheng looked at Qin Yu and said in a deep voice, ” “Your primordial spirit is damaged. You’re alive, but I’m afraid that you will need a long time to repair your primordial spirit.

“Before you recover, both your strength and cultivation strength will be affected. I advise you to rest for a while.”

After hearing Xiao Sheng’s words, Qin Yu looked unhappy.

Rest? How could he have time to rest?

Advancing to the Reversion Void Stage required an extremely long period of time. To Qin Yu, recuperation was simply too extravagant.

Qin Yu tried to get up, but as soon as he stood up, he felt a sharp pain in his head.

The pain made Qin Yu collapse onto the bed again.

“How could this be…” Qin Yu looked very frustrated.

He struggled to get up again, but this time, the pain in his head was even more intense!

It was the aftermath of his primordial spirit being severely injured.

“No!” Qin Yu gritted his teeth and tried to get up again.

However, the result was the same. The pain became more intense each time.

Xiao Sheng stood at the side, silently watching.

He knew that with Qin Yu’s personality, nothing he said would be of any use.

Qin Yu stood up again and again, but fell down again and again.

Qin Yu failed 13 times.

“You’d better rest for a while,” Xiao Sheng said in a deep voice.

“Is there any way to heal my primordial spirit quickly? I…” Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said.

“No. From what I know, the answer is no,” Xiao Sheng said cleanly.

Qin Yu looked at Xiao Sheng and asked, “How long will this situation last?”

“The damage to the primordial spirit is a major matter. I’m afraid it’ll last years or even decades,” said Xiao Sheng as he stood up.

Qin Yu’s face showed a trace of despair!

Years or even decades? This was undoubtedly a bolt from the blue for Qin Yu!

“Don’t despair. For cultivators, a few years or even decades are just the blink of an eye,” Xiao Sheng said.

Qin Yu looked desperate.

He couldn’t even afford to wait a few years, let alone decades.

After a few years, it would be too late.

Qin Yu, who was lying on the bed limply, tried to get up again!

The pain this time was even more intense than before!

It was pitch black in front of him, as if the entire world was spinning!

The excruciating pain made him sweat profusely!

Qin Yu’s body was swaying, and he was about to fall at any moment.

Seeing this, Xiao Sheng’s heart ached a little. He reached out his hand, wanting to help Qin Yu up. However, at this moment, Qin Yu grabbed the bed pole and stood up with all his might!

At this time, Qin Yu’s forehead was covered with sweat, which kept dripping down like rain!

However, no matter how painful it was, Qin Yu didn’t fall!

He just stood there like a pine tree under the heavy snow!

Upon seeing this, Xiao Sheng said in a deep voice, “Even if you can stand up, what’s the point?”

Qin Yu endured the pain and said word by word, “If… I can’t change it, then I…will try to get used to this pain…and continue my work with the pain…”

Xiao Sheng opened his mouth but did not know what to say.

He was very surprised, but felt some admiration.

“You’re like Xiao Hai,” Xiao Sheng said after a while.

“You’re both very stubborn, so stubborn that it’s hard for people to understand you.”
