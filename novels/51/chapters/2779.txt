Chapter 2780: The Forbidden Power

“This is the Creepy. This physical body has long lost its life. It only relies on the Creepy on its body to move and this is only the weakest.”

Aiden said to the two.

When the body was destroyed, a ball of orange light turned into a ferocious ghost face.

It flashed through the air, then let out a strange laugh and disappeared in front of the few of them.

The three of them did not stay long but quickly went to the bottom of the cliff.

When Qin Yu stepped on the ground, he only felt an extremely sticky feeling.

It was as if he was stepping on blood that would not melt for ten thousand years. It took some effort to raise his foot.

Silence! Endless deathly stillness!

This was Qin Yu’s first impression.

“Qin Yu, don’t use the power of the Primal Chaos Flame. The stronger the power, the more powerful Creepy you’ll attract. This is also my first time here.

We’ll investigate properly first.”

Aiden signaled Qin Yu to extinguish the Primal Chaos Flame.

Under the projection of a huge star in the sky, the sky above the bottom of the cliff was filled with a layer of strange colors.

It was like soap bubbles pervading the sun with love. However, this color was very heavy and bloody, giving people an extremely oppressive feeling.

Moreover, the bloody color of the bubbles gave Qin Yu a freezy feeling.

The moment Qin Yu’s Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze landed above, they would roll and move before suddenly disappearing. It was as if they were alive. Qin Yu’s gaze gave them a sense of danger, which was why they avoided it.

At this moment, a mass of squirming energy exploded. The bloody light swept the three of them in.

In an instant, they seemed to have entered another gloomy space.

The scene suddenly changed drastically as if they had been pulled into an alternate dimension.

“Be careful, the Creepy is descending!”

Aiden placed the Sun Chasing Bow in his hand. His expression was grave.

Thump! Thump! Thump!

After the dull footsteps, a nearly four-meter-tall giant slowly walked towards them.

Behind him was an absurdly gigantic axe. The axe was covered in flesh and blood. It was unknown how many corpses it had killed.

The giant’s skin was the color of stone. Only a blood-red eye was in the middle of his huge head.

After rolling his eyes a few times, his pupils instantly aimed at Qin Yu and the other two.

Whoosh!

A fierce force suddenly rose. The gigantic axe suddenly slashed out horizontally.

“You’re courting death!”

Chang Mang roared and kicked the tip of the axe.

The axe and the leg collided with a dull thud.

The giant’s eyeball suddenly bulged out and filled with countless blood vessels.

In an instant, it turned into a bloody eye. A violent internal qi immediately emitted from his body.

Blood vessels as thick as hemp ropes burst out on his thick arms.

A terrifying force was transmitted into the gigantic axe. Chang Mang’s entire body was sent flying.

“Oh no!”

Aiden’s expression changed drastically.

The scene began to distort, then turned into a folded transparent space.

It fell into the space where Chang Mang had fallen in an instant and a terrifying shockvvave swept out.

Qin Yu’s body flashed past. Thousands of punches were thrown in an instant.

In the silver light that filled the sky, Qin Yu’s fist directly tore the giant’s body apart.

The scene changed again and returned to its previous appearance.

A ferocious consciousness remained at the same place.

Nine Heavens Holy Sword!

The Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze opened abruptly. A dazzling golden light streaked across.

It instantly shattered the consciousness. A viscous blood-like energy was immediately absorbed into a jade bottle.

“F*ck! It hurts!”

Chang Mang staggered out with a jade bottle in one hand.

At this moment, there was an exaggerated wound on his chest.

However, his body was squirming and recovering at lightning speed.

“Idiot, didn’t you sense the forbidden power just now?”

Qin Yu shook his head speechlessly.

After the Creepy had surrounded them, there was a clear restriction in that space.

He could sense it with his divine sense. The forbidden power was the holy energy restriction.

In other words, they could not use any Saint Power when they fought with the giant.

Otherwise, this restriction would be triggered. It was connected to the blood vessels and the sky that had just been pulled into space. Chang Mang had directly violated it.

“I noticed it too, but I wanted to see the consequences of violating it. This thing is quite powerful! If I hadn’t fused with so many Hearts of Saint Kingdom, I’m afraid I wouldn’t have been able to withstand it.”

Chang Mang rubbed the back of his head.

“This should be the lowest level of Creepy here. If you encounter an even stronger Creepy, you’ll be courting death by doing this. The stronger the Creepy, the higher their consciousness. They will use any opportunity to lead you to the restrictions.”

Aiden was speechless.

Qin Yu sensed the power here and frowned.

How did such a strange thing happen? If it were ordinary consciousness devouring each other, it would not be able to produce such an ability.

Could some kind of power or magical artifact at the bottom of the cliff make these evil consciousnesses produce such a creepy power?

As they moved forward, a few Creepy powers pulled them in.

However, they easily resolved these Creepy powers after a round of battle.

The power was collected in the jade bottle.

“These Creepy are both strong and weak! There’s no danger if you follow the restrictions and don’t detonate them.”

Aiden frowned as he analyzed. These few battles were a little easy.

This made his tensed nerves finally relax a little.

The Creepy’s internal qi in the bottle gradually accumulated.

“Alright! This mission will be completed in another five or six days! I can sever all ties with the Guardian of Order then.”

Chang Mang waved his fist.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“I think it’s not that simple. The Guardian of Order pushes the four of you out and provides you so many resources. How could they let you leave so easily? The conditions are too strange based on the difficulty of this mission.” Aiden shook his head. He thought this matter was not simple.

At the end of the endless Creepy in the abyss at the bottom of the cliff, a man slowly knelt. His face was abnormally pale.

If Chang Mang were here, he would realize that this person was Yi Yun, who had previously given him the sect mission.

A monk in front of him slowly stood up. He looked at the waterhole in front of him with a strange smile.

The figures within kept flashing. Upon closer inspection, they were Qin Yu and the other two.

He seemed to have sensed that Qin Yu and the others had entered the bottom

of the cliff..
