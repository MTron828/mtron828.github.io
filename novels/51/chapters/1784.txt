1785 The Consequences of Devouring Primordial Spirit

“The True Saint!” Qin Yu’s face instantly turned pale.

If a True Saint emerged, he could easily sweep away the entire Nanzhou.

Although Xiao Sheng was strong, he probably could not even fight back facing a True Saint.

Even a wisp of the True Saint’s internal qi was not something a Reversion Void Stage cultivator could withstand.

“Why would someone from Zhongzhou want to attack Xiao Sheng…” Qin Yu knitted his brows tightly.

At this moment, Qin Yu remembered the young man previously.

“Was it due to that matter?” Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

Previously the young man was from Zhongzhou. He was extremely powerful.

To save Qin Yu, Xiao Sheng had unintentionally offended them.

“Besides them, I don’t think Xiao Sheng has come into contact with anyone else from Zhongzhou,” thought Qin Yu.

“If that’s the case, I’m afraid their target isn’t Xiao Sheng alone.” Qin Yu took a deep breath. After all, he was the one who started it.

At the thought of this, Qin Yu looked at the sect master of God Bless Sect and said, “Senior, can I trouble you for a few days? I want to see those two people.”

The sect master of God Bless Sect master frowned slightly and said, “Why do you want to see them?”

“I need to verify something,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

The sect master of God Bless Sect thought for a while before nodding and said, “Alright. But you guys must be careful. They’re not easy to deal with.”

“Many thanks.” Qin Yu bowed slightly.

Therefore, Qin Yu and Jue Wu followed him back to God Bless Sect, planning to stay there for a few days.

After some exchange, they gathered that the name of the sect master of God Bless Sect was Yao Yingxuan. He came to the East Continent many years ago.

He had spent many years gaining a foothold in the East Continent and established the God Bless Sect.

The current God Bless Sect was extremely glorious. In the entire East Continent, it was considered one of the most powerful.

This was also why the Tong family had come to look for Yao Yingxuan.

If even Yao Yingxuan dared not agree, no one in the East Continent would dare to make a move on Xiao Sheng.

When the time came, the Tong family would definitely take action themselves and annihilate Tianyun Sect quietly.

In the room.

Qin Yu was sitting sat there, deep in thought.

Beside him, Jue Wu looked quite laid-back, as if she was playing on a swing.

“Jue Wu, if things don’t go well in three days, you must rush to Nanzhou and tell Xiao Sheng everything,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Jue Wu glanced at Qin Yu and said, ” Why? Why don’t you go yourself?”

“This matter is very likely related to me,” said Qin Yu in a deep voice. “I don’t dare to trust Yao yYngxuan completely.”

“If what he said is not true, I’m afraid I’m doomed.”

Jue Wu snorted and said, “Don’t worry. Since I’m with you, I won’t abandon you and run away myself.

“When the time comes, I’ll kill my way out!” Jue Wu said, waving her little fist.

Qin Yu sighed slightly.

Jue Wu was rather innocent and one who upheld justice. It was simply unrealistic to let her leave first.

“Looks like I need to plan well,” thought Qin Yu.

In the afternoon, Qin Yu left God Bless Sect and returned to the restaurant.

He observed the restaurant for a long time and planned a simple escape route.

After doing all this, Qin Yu felt a little relieved.

That night.

Qin Yu, who was in a deep sleep, had nightmares non-stop.

The bloody scene kept flashing in front of Qin Yu.

Countless bodies with hideous faces rushed toward Qin Yu crazily.

Qin Yu, who was in a deep sleep, suddenly woke up.

He was sweating profusely, and his entire body was almost exhausted, as if he had just experienced a great battle.

It made Qin Yu have an extremely bad feeling in his heart.

His expression was ugly, and he was panting slightly.

At this moment, the greed and impulse in his heart burst forth again.

Compared with daytime, it seemed to be much more intense at this moment.

The scene of devouring the primordial spirits kept appearing in Qin Yu’s mind. It was as if forcing Qin Yu to continue devouring the primordial spirits!

“No, I can’t…” Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He sat cross-legged and activated his Meridian Circulation Technique, trying his best to suppress the impulse.

After some time, this impulse finally dissipated to a great extent.

However, Qin Yu knew very well that this was only a delaying tactic. Soon or later it would explode again.

“I’m afraid it will be even more intense the next time…” Qin Yu murmured and his face was full of worry.

That night, lying in bed, Qin Yu was sleepless.

Qin Yu only got up when the sky turned bright. He started to wander around the God Bless Sect.

God Bless Sect was rather quiet in the morning. There was a dao discussion hall on top of the mountain.

Countless God Bless Sect disciples were sitting there, listening to the Great Dao.

The Great Dao rumbled and bathed everyone along with the sunlight.

Qin Yu didn’t know where the sound came from, but listening to the Great Dao calmed him down tremendously.

“Compared to Nanzhou, the sects in the East Continent seem to be more mature,” thought Qin Yu.

He had never seen such a scene in Tianyun Sect before.

But when thinking about it, it was normal. Xiao Sheng had long adopted the hands-off approach. If it were not for his great reputation, Tianyun Sect would have fallen apart long ago.

In the following two days.

The impulse in Qin Yu’s heart was like a drug addiction that acted up from time to time.

Even though he was trying his best to restrain himself, this greed was getting even stronger.

Even the way he looked at Jue Wu had become a little strange.

From time to time, he would circulate the Meridian Circulation Technique quietly to restrain this impulse.

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

This morning, Yao Yingxuan came to look for Qin Yu and Jue Wu.

“It’s time to set off,” Yao Yingxuan said.

“Mmm.” Qin Yu responded and rushed to the restaurant with Jue Wu.

After arriving at the restaurant, Yao Yingxuan looked at Qin Yu and said, “The two of you, find a place to hide and try not to be discovered by them.”

Qin Yu quickly nodded. Fortunately, many people were here, so they were not afraid of their internal qi to be detected.

Yao Yingxuan was quite courteous. He had reserved a room for Qin Yu and Jue Wu. He then walked to the room where he had the appointment.

As soon as Jue Wu entered the room, she began ordering dishes. She ordered everything she could.

Whether it was food or wine, Jue Wu didn’t let go of anything.

In a short while, the table was full.

This table had cost more than three million spirit coins. It was simply luxurious.

Qin Yu didn’t have the heart to let Yao Yingxuan pay the bill, so he had paid in advance.

Immediately after, Qin Yu activated his desolate divine eye and looked at the room next to theirs.

Under the desolate divine eye, nothing could hide. Everything was under Qin Yu’s gaze.

The two members of the Tong family had already arrived.

Seeing Yao Yingxuan come in, the two didn’t have much change in their expressions.

“How is it? Did you bring the Saint Weapon?” Yao Yingxuan opened the door and asked immediately.
