2325 The Crystal of Life

“This is the battlefield between the human race and the alien races. Although it’s dead silent now, the living beings here are all extremely terrifying existence. You’ve been to the ninth level before, so you should know I’m not exaggerating.

Ji Yue’s mouth was like a machine gun, continuously spewing out numerous secrets, trying to intimidate Qin Yu.

“I’ll do my best to be fully prepared before going over. Moreover, I also have my trump card. You don’t have to say anything else. Thank you for your information.”

“D*mn it, are you blind? You don’t take my words seriously.”

Jue Wu punched Qin Yu directly, causing his mouth to become misaligned.

“F*ck, it hurts!”

Jue Wu’s fist now, even if it was an ordinary attack, contained a shocking force.

Qin Yu took a long time to recover from this punch.

“How many times have you risked your life to save me? You must die before me to make me feel guilty for the rest of my life.”

Qin Yu’s eyes brimmed with tears.

The two of them initially did not have much of a relationship, but after getting to know each other, Jue We repeatedly helped Qin Yu.

“Even Dean Lei can’t solve the curse of the Nirvana Body. The Holy Region has so many resources, but he can’t do anything about it. Can you please don’t waste your time anymore? After all, I’m very happy to come to purgatory during this time. I’ve eaten a lot of meats that I’ve never seen before.”

“What Hua Tian said is indeed true. I deduced that your chance of survival is indeed on Vermilion Bird, and not completely no chance at all. Trust me and listen to me.”

Jue Wu had a struggling expression. Everyone would want to stay alive. Who would willingly accept sudden death in their prime?”

At Jue Wu’s current age, she was at the golden stage of cultivators.

She would soar into the sky if she could break through the shackles of the Nirvana Body.

“Elder Guai, you guys rest in Solitary Cloud City for a while.”

Qin Yu put down Elder Guai and the others, including Xiaoru and Little Fatty. He placed them all in Solitary Cloud City.

“Two tree demons? Any tiny bit of these two little things is enough to make people snatch them away. You can rest assured leaving them here.” Ji Yue stared at the two little things curiously.

“Please take care of them. I don’t have any confidence in going this time, but this is something that must be done.”

Ji Yue did not answer Qin Yu. She stared straight at Qin Yu and then took out a crystal that was as long as an arm.

Qin Yu’s pupils constricted.

The Crystal of Life was the purified crystallization of the Water of Life. It was thousands of times purer than the Water of Life.

Each small piece of the Life Crystal could be used to dilute and brew an enormous lake of Water of Life.

This piece of Crystal of Life could be said to have the potential to incite frenzied plunder.

As long as he held a small piece of this thing in his hand, its Life Aura would continuously heal his injuries.

Such a large piece of crystal was basically inexhaustible.

“What do you want to exchange it for?”

“Master Hei Yu’s spear, Immortal Binding Rope, the masked woman’s coffin, 100 pieces of True Saint Realm demon beast inner cores, and 10 Saint Weapons.”

“Not the masked woman’s coffin. It’s not good to take this thing. I’ve always suspected that the masked woman is still alive. Can you resist her if she looks for you?”

Qin Yu shook his head. This coffin still had many secrets that he had yet to understand.

“Alright then. I don’t want it. I’ll trade it for 1,000 barrels of bone cultivation water from the eighth level of purgatory.”

“Alright.”

Qin Yu did not waste time and directly took out the items.

He then took out 1,000 barrels of bone cultivation water from the Sumeru ring and handed them to Ji Yue.

“Thanks.”

Qin Yu nodded. Unfortunately, the Life Aura was useless against the curse against Jue Wu.

“Qin Yu, I’m not going!”

Jue Wu turned around and left.

Qin Yu’s Spiritualization Technique directly grabbed Jue Wu and threw her into the Sumeru ring.

With a flash of his body, he set off again.

Not long after, he returned to the peak of the eighth level.

“Stop smashing. My Sumeru ring will break if you continue smashing.”

Without wasting time, he unleashed the Five Element and Eight Trigram Technique.

His divine sense entered the boundless sky comprehending the vast universe.

“Did you feel it too? The power of the Path of Heaven is completely emptied at this moment, and not a trace of it remains. Could it be that the Heavenly Dao tide is about to return?”

After reaching the fifth-grade True Saint, one would be extremely sensitive to capturing the energy of the Path of Heaven.

“Yes, I’m waiting for an opportunity.”

After the surge of the power of the tide, it started to roll again, and that was the biggest wave of the tide.

Qin Yu wanted to challenge the Vermillion Bird when the power of the Path of Heaven was at its peak.

That was also when the Path of Heaven suppressed many cultivators the most. The power of the tribulation could not be unleashed.

Otherwise, according to Ji Yue’s information, the Vermilion Bird could unleash the power of tribulation under the suppression of the ordinary Path of Heaven.

Even a trace of the Vermilion Bird’s power of tribulation could turn him into ashes.

The giant compass formed by the Five Element and Eight Trigram Technique continued deducing in the void. Qin Yu’s chaotic qi was consumed at a terrifying speed.

“Traceless Immortal Scripture.”

His body turned into a vortex.

The Bone Cultivation River flowed into his body like a cascading waterfall.

After that, a vast amount of spiritual energy entered his body, and the bone cultivation water, which had no spiritual energy at all, rolled down at his back.

It turned into an ordinary river and flushed away.

This terrifying speed of absorbing spiritual energy shocked Mei Li. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

In the Degenerate Age, the Traceless Immortal Scripture would forcefully draw in even a trace of residual spiritual energy in the void.

This was how terrifying his Meridian Circulation Technique was.

A vast amount of spiritual energy was injected into the compass in the void, and the compass instantly started to spin rapidly.

The machinery cracking sound filled the space. Numerous future possibilities were fed back to Qin Yu’s divine sense.

“Sigh.”

Qin Yu sighed softly.

The deduction technique could only deduce a rough outline.

“By employing extensive magic and techniques to refine the route as much as possible, Mei Li could also feel that the power of the Path of Heaven was about to change, though she could not further narrow down this judgment.

At this moment, Qin Yu continued to narrow down and saw many unfavorable possibilities.

Hua Tian had told him a very pessimistic piece of good news.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and shifted all his emotions out of his mind.

The change in the power of the Path of Heaven should be coming soon, and he had to make the most of this time to cultivate.

Soon, Qin Yu’s body filled with the chaotic qi.

Qin Yu loosely clenched his fist and did not stop the Traceless Immortal Scripture.

That Meridian Circulation Technique accelerated again, and a vast amount of spiritual qi suddenly infused into his body.

“Boom!”

A golden bloody hole appeared on his body.

“F*ck!”

This time, Qin Yu’s body nearly exploded with the compression.
