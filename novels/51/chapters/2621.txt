Chapter 2622: Decisive Battle

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Blade techniques? I can’t evade this strike.”

Qin Yu frowned, as if the blade techniques displayed within this Saint Kingdom were even more peculiar.

At this moment, the blade techniques resembled a storm devastating a city.

The red dot representing the Order of Reflection appeared before Qin Yu’s eyes, extending slowly towards Ju Wuwei.

“Drop the blade, or I can’t guarantee that I can retract this strike,” Ju Wuwei laughed heartily.

“General.”

Suddenly, a chilling sensation halted his laughter. His throat had been cut by a fine, blood-soaked line.

If the Vajra Long Saber had gone any deeper, his windpipe would have been completely severed.

“What a terrifying technique. We can’t practice with this pair.” Ju Wuwei sighed, unaware of the origin of the unseen blade.

“In fact, this is the peculiarity of this Saint Kingdom. The ways here are interdependent and counteractive. Even the most powerful individuals find it challenging to stand atop without facing death. Perhaps this is the balance of the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom.” Qin Yu speculated.

“That’s probably it. Each Saint Kingdom has its unique Order. However, with the Holy Lord’s demise, the power of this Order gradually weakens. The City Lord of Nine Tune City is a case in point,” Lu Yue analyzed.

“According to my speculation, the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom classifies the heavenly realm into five levels, which are Confused Consciousness, Human Consciousness, True Consciousness, Dao Consciousness, and Holy

Consciousness. We should be situated between Confused Consciousness and Human Consciousness. Figures like City Lord Cang Zhi of Nine Tune City or Seifer have already reached the pinnacle of Human Consciousness. These living beings possess strong consciousness and may even form a formidable thought process,” Lu Yue explained.

“What kind of thoughts?” Shen Qian inquired curiously.

“Exclusion. As long as outsiders exist, true freedom is unattainable. Once someone collects the Heart of the Saint Kingdom, they disintegrate with a single thought. Any living being born here cannot resist the Holy Lord’s will.

Thus, the longer we survive, the more troublesome encounters we may face.” Li Yue concluded with a wry smile.

Qin Yu nodded in agreement, refraining from elaborating further.

The City Lord of Nine Tune City represented an even more formidable existence.

He could conceal his cultivation, preventing Saint Chen Shuang from detecting it. This level of power is not something an ordinary Human Consciousness could attain.

Boom!

Just as they were conversing, an explosion erupted. It was Xiao Yunfei’s skill core explosion and the formidable shockwave swept toward Qin Yu.

Even though she had witnessed it several times, the terrifying power still astonished Qin Yu.

“What an intimidating power. However, the activation requires too much time.

Without someone to cooperate, hitting the target becomes quite challenging.”

Qin Yu’s Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze had been fixed on Xiao Yunfei, discerning his weaknesses with a single glance.

“Immortal Emperor Yao, Cang Zhi mentioned needing to harness the power of the Heart of Saint Kingdom. How do I activate this power?”

Qin Yu inquired tentatively in his sea of consciousness.

“The power of the Heart of Saint Kingdom can only be utilized after you’ve comprehended the order here. You can only tap into the power of the Saint Kingdom after reaching the True Consciousness level. This is the purest and most violent force of the Kingdom. Of course, this energy serves various purposes, such as cultivation, artifact crafting, combat, healing, and even breaking through certain restrictions, as the City Lord likely intends.” Immortal Emperor Yao answered Qin Yu’s query.

At that moment, within Nine Tune City, a destructive consciousness suddenly descended upon the city.

Seifer had fully recovered from the weakened state of his army.

A cold and eerie spiritual aura suddenly enshrouded the entire Nine Tune City.

Simultaneously, another consciousness burst out of the bunker, and maniacal laughter echoed throughout Nine Tune City.

“Do you think you can act so recklessly in my territory?

In an instant, the chilling spiritual qi dissipated.

The bone fire in Seifer’s eyes blazed. He pointed at the city with his pale finger. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Very formidable, comparable to me.”

“It’s fine. He is also restricted to the outer region. As long as he can’t attack outsiders, I can handle them alone. The Heart of the Saint Kingdom is too wasted on you.”

Looking at Nine Tune City, Ming Xie revealed a greedy expression.

“If it weren’t for the fact that I can’t attack outsiders, I would want to kill you and see what secrets you have to be so powerful. Your power is even more terrifying than the most powerful black dragon under my command.”

Seifer laughed hoarsely.

“You will know very soon.”

Ming Xie also revealed a strange smile.

A year passed quickly in the Time Rubik’s Cube. During this year, Qin Yu became more familiar with the Order of Reflection.

Including his close combat skills, Qin Yu’s progress had improved significantly after fighting Ju Wuwei for a year.

However, he still couldn’t cultivate his own ‘force’ like Ju Wuwei. This power was different from his Evil Eye sword move.

It completely abandoned the rules and was purely a force produced by combining the blade and one’s strength, similar to Xi Menn’s One Sword One World.

Ju Wuwei’s blade techniques also advanced to another realm. Li Yue, Shen Qian, Xiao Yunfei, and the others also had made significant improvements.

When they came out, the necromancy army had also gathered.

The eight black dragons covered the sky and the sun as they circled Nine Tune City, sending shivers down one’s spine.

“Although we have eliminated Seifer’s power in this battle, our situation is still not optimistic. We have to stop Seifer’s army from entering the deeper regions. This person can defeat Ju Wuwei with a single punch. Whether it’s his soul, Saint Power, or physical body, he’s at least in the black dragon realm. If we don’t take care of him, we won’t be able to win.”

Lu Yue said solemnly.

“I have a question. Why is it that once the city falls, we are considered to have failed? What if we escape from Nine Tune City?”

Shen Qian still did not understand.

“Junior Sister Shen Qian, actually, from how you came to Nine Tune City, I can tell that I wanted to avoid this city at that time. However, no matter how I walked, I could only come here. Moreover, whether it’s the soldiers or General Li Liefei, apart from fighting and answering in a fixed pattern, they have almost no other emotions.”

Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

“This is just a random secret realm instance set up by Saint Chen Shuang to conduct the initial investigation of outsiders. If it fails, the power of the wipe will completely clear the person..”
