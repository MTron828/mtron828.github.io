Chapter 1207: Chapter 1207, the secret of the chaotic body 

Looking at Old Meng’s Strange Smile, Qin Yu also understood something.

Sure enough, a person’s face could change. The day before, when she saw her, she was still honest and kind, but now she seemed a bit sinister and treacherous.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “Aunt, it’s too late now. Why don’t We Talk About It Tomorrow?”

Old Meng put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Let’s set off now. We can’t afford to waste time.”

“I’m not going.”Qin Yu rejected Old Meng.

Old Meng narrowed his eyes and said, “Do you think you still have a choice now?”

Before he finished his words, the two figures hiding in the darkness slowly walked out.

Seeing the attire of these two people, Qin Yu’s expression instantly turned cold.

These two people were also wearing black robes. They were almost identical to what Qin Yu had seen in the inkstone.

Qin Yu looked at Old Meng and said coldly, “Aunt, what do you mean by this?”

Old Meng laughed loudly and said, “Young Man, you have too little insight into this world. There are many things that you can not imagine.”

With that, old Meng waved his hand, and the two black-robed men arrived in front of Qin Yu with a whoosh.

They held chains in their hands and threw them forward, binding Qin Yu. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Qin Yu did not struggle. He could tell that this matter was not simple.

Moreover, old Meng had not seen his strength at all. Therefore, Qin Yu planned to use this opportunity to investigate.

“Take him away,”old Meng said coldly.

The two black-robed men were like black and white impermanence. They pulled the chains that bound Qin Yu and followed behind Old Meng, getting into a car.

Qin Yu sat in the car, his heart growing colder and colder.

“Old Meng, aren’t you and my mother best friends? Could it be that you have something to do with my mother’s disappearance?”Qin Yu leaned against the car and asked.

Old Meng said indifferently, “Best friends? All the feelings in this world can be abandoned. To You, this might be a little profound.”

Qin Yu laughed coldly.

These people seemed to be the same. After obtaining a certain level of ability, they always thought that they had seen through the entire world, pointing and pointing with a god-like perspective.

“In this case, my mother’s disappearance really has something to do with you,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Old Meng said indifferently, “No need to be anxious. You will know everything soon.”

“I don’t understand. My mother and I are just ordinary people. What value do we have to you?”Qin Yu pretended to be annoyed and asked.

“I told you, you’ll know soon. There’s no need to be anxious,”old Meng said coldly.

Qin Yu didn’t give up. He continued to ask, “Is my mother still alive? What did you do to her?”

“You talk too much.”Old Meng lost his patience.

She turned around and gently tapped with her shriveled claw-like fingers. A Ray of Light Sealed Qin Yu’s mouth.

With such strength, Qin Yu could easily break free, but he was not in a hurry.

The car sped all the way to Rainbow Village.

Qin Yu leaned against the car and did not speak on the way.

After about ten hours, when they arrived at Rainbow Village, the sky was already bright.

The village was as calm as ever. This matter did not seem to have anything to do with them.

Old Meng drove the car to a desolate mountain range. There was a huge mud house here.

“Keep an eye on him. Bring him to meet the Lord at night,”Old Meng said coldly.

The two black-robed men nodded. Then, they carried Qin Yu and threw him into the mud house to lock him up.

The surroundings were pitch-black, so dark that one could not see one’s fingers.

Qin Yu could not help but feel anxious. He was eager to know who was behind Old Meng, or the organization, and the Lord he spoke of, and who he was.

He could not be hasty. Qin Yu could only sit there quietly and wait for night to fall.

Outside.

Old Meng took out his phone and made a call to someone.

“I have already caught the person and he is now in Rainbow Village.”Old Meng said.

The person on the other end grunted in acknowledgement, and then said with some wariness: “He is from the fire country. I heard that there have been quite a number of martial artists in the fire country recently. There shouldn’t be any powerful background behind this pyro, right?”

Old Meng scoffed and said: “Don’t worry. This person is just an ordinary person and there isn’t any spirit energy fluctuation within his body.”

“That’s enough. take him to see the Lord Tonight.”

After saying that, he hung up the phone.

The sky gradually darkened.

A full moon quietly climbed onto the treetops.

“Creak.”

A sudden sound woke qin yu up from his comprehension of the fighting word formula.

Then, he saw the two black-robed men walk in.

They didn’t say anything. They just roughly grabbed the chains that were stretched out from Qin Yu’s body and slid on the ground.

Qin Yu was once again stuffed into the car, heading in an unknown direction.

Soon, the car arrived at the border and drove into a city called triangle city.

This surprised Qin Yu. He thought Old Meng had something to do with the ancient array platform, but it wasn’t the case.

The car drove into triangle city and arrived at the entrance of a luxurious palace in the center.

“We’re here,”Old Meng said with a smile.

The two black-robed men dragged Qin Yu into the palace.

The moment they entered the palace, Qin Yu felt a chill.

They dragged Qin Yu along the long corridor and finally stopped at the entrance of an office.

This office was decorated extremely luxuriously, resembling the office of a modern president.

Sitting in the office was a middle-aged man in a suit and tie. This middle-aged man looked well-dressed, like a successful person.

He was holding a cigar in his hand, sitting on the sofa and smoking. He was holding a glass of red wine in his hand.

In front of him, there seemed to be two guests who were discussing important matters. However, when they saw Qin Yu who was tied up, they were not surprised at all.

“Chief Bao, I have already brought the person here,”said old Meng.

The man called Chief Bao nodded slightly and said indifferently, “I don’t know if this kid has any value or if he has inherited his mother’s physique. The Lord is still waiting.”

Old Meng said with a smile, “I don’t know about that. I have to ask Chief Bao to investigate it himself.”
