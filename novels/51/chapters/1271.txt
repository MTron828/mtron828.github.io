Chapter 1272: Chapter 1,272, amassing wealth 

Qin Yu kept the card, intending to continue amassing wealth.

He took out a few troublesome orders and read them carefully.

These orders were basically all for spirit coins, but the price wasn’t as expensive as the spirit monarch lion. Most of them were around 300,000.

Even though Qin Yu didn’t particularly like money, spirit coins were used throughout the entire saint realm. As long as one had enough spirit coins, one could buy natural treasures and even life energy.

Thus, it was still useful to amass a fortune.

The news of Qin Yu killing the spirit monarch lion soon spread throughout the entire hunter organization.

For a time, Qin Yu’s name became quite famous in the hunter organization.

He had just entered the hunter organization and solved a difficult problem, which made many people begin to doubt Qin Yu’s identity.

“That kid is most likely a disciple from a large sect who came out to train.”

“It’s also possible that he’s a descendant of a large family or a disciple of a big shot who went into seclusion.”

While everyone was guessing Qin Yu’s identity, he had already set off with Guan Zhuang, killing Demon Beasts.

Qin Yu was an extremely generous person. He planned to give half of the 450,000 spirit coins to Guan Zhuang, but was rejected by Guan Zhuang.

Under Qin Yu’s insistence, Guan Zhuang only received 100,000 spirit coins.

In the next few days.

Qin Yu’s actions were extremely swift, it could be said that he was swift and decisive.

In just a short eight days, the demonic beasts on these few orders were all killed by Qin Yu, completely massacred.

This instantly made Qin Yu’s name become famous in the Hunter organization!

And they became more and more curious about Qin Yu’s identity.

“This kid, it’s very likely that he has a very big background.”Jing Bai’s sworn enemy Zhong Wu couldn’t help but start guessing.

“If he could be on the list of a big family, who would be willing to stay here and work hard every day?”Zhong Wu thought to himself.

Although most hunters liked freedom, there was no lack of people like Zhong Wu.

From this moment on, in Zhong Wu’s heart, Qin Yu had already become a person with a very strong background.

On this day, Qin Yu received the spirit coins from Jing Bai.

He had just stepped out when Zhong Wu walked over with a smile.

“Brother Qin.”Zhong wu cupped his hands slightly towards Qin Yu.

Qin Yu naturally knew of the conflict between Zhong Wu and Jing Bai. He remained calm and replied with a bow, “Brother Zhong, what’s the matter?”

Zhong wu smiled and said, “Can’t I chat with you if I have nothing to do?”

“Of course you can.”Qin Yu smiled and said.

Zhong wu cupped his hands and said, “I have just prepared delicious food and fine wine. Do you want to eat some together?”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and nodded. “Alright, then I won’t stand on ceremony.”

Zhong wu pulled off a thigh from an unknown demonic beast and roasted it with flames.

Apart from that, he also prepared two bottles of bejewelled wine.

The taste of this fine wine was even more mellow compared to the immortal crane wine from before. It couldn’t help but make people sigh.

“Speaking of which, Brother Qin has great abilities. Why Don’t you find a large sect or a large aristocratic family?”

After three rounds of drinking, Zhong Wu began to pry.

Qin Yu saw through his intentions at a glance and immediately said helplessly, “No sect is willing to take me.”

Zhong Wu rolled his eyes and said, “Brother Qin, that’s not nice. With your abilities, which sect can’t treat you as a treasure?”

“Treat me as a treasure? You think too highly of me,”Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

“I was chased out by the Heavenly Cloud sect not long ago.”

“Heavenly Cloud Sect?”When he heard this, Zhong Wu’s eyes immediately lit up.

Qin Yu was speaking the truth, but to Zhong Wu’s ears, it sounded different.

“Looks like this kid came from the Heavenly Cloud sect. No wonder he has such great abilities,”Zhong Wu thought to himself.

“He might be the illegitimate child of some important figure in the Heavenly Cloud Sect.”

Qin Yu’s ability, coupled with the seven-colored divine Phoenix he rode on previously, made Zhong Wu even more certain of Qin Yu’s identity.

Thinking of this, Zhong Wu’s attitude toward Qin Yu became even more humble. It was more or less the same.

Qin Yu knew that this Zhong Wu was not a good person, and he could also see the change in Zhong Wu’s attitude.

His eyes rolled, and he decided to use tiger skin as a banner. He smiled and said, “Brother Zhong Wu, I was in a hurry to come out and didn’t bring much money with me. I want to go out to buy some things in a few days. I wonder if brother Zhong can lend me some first?”

Zhong Wu didn’t even think and said, “Brother Qin, just tell me how much you need!”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “Five million.”

“Hiss...”

When he heard this number, Zhong Wu’s eyes immediately widened.

Five million! To a hunter, this was simply an astronomical figure!

But at the same time, this also confirmed Zhong Wu’s thoughts.

Asking for five million, this kid must be from a big aristocratic family! Otherwise, how could he have such confidence!

Thinking of this, Zhong Wu looked at Qin Yu and said, “Brother Qin, I’m really sorry. I don’t have that much. Even if I plunder it all, I can at most gather a million.”

“AH? So Little?”Qin Yu pretended to be disgusted.

Zhong wu sighed and said, “Hunters are all very poor. They are not like your big aristocratic families. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have come to this green rock forest to sell their lives.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Forget it. If it’s more than a million, then it’s more than a million.”Qin Yu pretended to be unwilling and said.

Zhong Wu did not say anything and hurriedly took out his card.

After this card came into contact with Qin Yu’s card, the more than a million went into Qin Yu’s card.

“Thank you very much.”Qin Yu cupped his hands and said to Zhong Wu.

Zhong Wu waved his hand and said with a smile, “We are friends. Since we are friends, there is no distinction between us.”

“Qin Yu, what are you doing here!”

At this moment, a rough voice was heard.

Looking Up, he saw Guan Zhuangzheng standing at the side with a dark face.

He pulled Qin Yu over and then pointed at Zhong Wu and warned, “Kid, I’m telling you, you better not have any ideas about Qin Yu. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being rude.”

Zhong wu pretended to be aggrieved and said, “What are you saying? Brother Qin and I are just having a meal and chatting about our daily life. What has it got to do with you?”

Guan Zhuang snorted coldly and said, “Don’t think that I don’t know what you are thinking!”

After saying that, Guan Zhuang pulled Qin Yu and turned around to leave.

“Team leader wants to see you. Follow Me,”Guan Zhuang said coldly.

Qin Yu frowned and muttered, “Team leader? Why is he looking for me? Could it be that the Tianyun sect came looking for me?”
