Chapter 569: Facing off Against Ma Hai Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

His arrogant tone made Ma Hai burst into laughter.

“Do you know who I am? No one dares to be so arrogant in front of me!” Ma Hai said coldly.

“Who you are has nothing to do with me. I just want to know who asked you to come.” Qin Yu questioned coldly.

Ma Hai narrowed his eyes and said with some displeasure, “Are you looking down on me? No one in the world dares to look down on me like this!”

Before he could finish his words, Ma Hai had already clenched his fist and came over!

The terrifying qi force instantly brought about gusts of violent wind!

As a half-step Martial Marquis, Ma Hai’s strength couldn’t be underestimated. His casual punch caused the air to buzz!

“Crack!”

However, just as his fist was about to Touch Qin Yu, it was easily caught by Qin Yu.

Ma Hai was stunned. Before he could react, a golden light had already appeared in front of his eyes!

Qin Yu clenched his golden fist and smashed it on Ma Hai’s chin from the bottom up!

With this punch, Ma Hai’s body flew up into the air and his chin was almost shattered!

He rolled in the air and stabilized his body with great difficulty.

Then, Ma Hai touched his chin and said coldly, “You’re really not as simple as you seem.”

Qin Yu just stood there quietly. There wasn’t a single trace of internal qi fluctuation from his body.

Ma Hai narrowed his eyes and stretched out his finger. Rays of light shot toward Qin Yu like bullets!

Qin Yu had an impassive expression and allowed the rays of light to fall on his body!

“Clang! Clang! Clang!”

The sound of metal colliding could be heard continuously!

Qin Yu endured these rays of light as he walked towards Ma Hai step by step.

Ma Hai’s expression changed drastically!

Just his physical body alone was able to withstand a spell? What kind of physique was this?

“As expected of a chaotic body!” The man with the mustache couldn’t help but feel flabbergasted!

The strength of this physical body had completely exceeded his scope of understanding!

“How could this guy’s physical body be so strong?!” Ma Hai immediately retreated!

With such a tough body, he definitely couldn’t fight with him by relying on brute force!

Ma Hai raised his finger again, and a red light immediately condensed on his fingertip!

The light slowly condensed on his fingertip, and a huge wave of light rapidly crushed toward Qin Yu!

Qin Yu had an impassive expression. He raised his palm and casually slapped over.

“Crack!”

The light ball that Ma Hai condensed was shattered by Qin Yu’s casual slap!

“How... how is this possible?!” Ma Hai gasped, and his expression instantly turned extremely ugly!

What kind of body was this? It was actually so tough to such an extent?

Even Ye Qing and Jiang He couldn’t do it.

“You... Who are you?!” A trace of panic flashed in Ma Hai’s eyes.

Qin Yu’s expression was ice-cold, and his eyes were filled with killing intent.

Without saying a word, his figure suddenly disappeared, and in the blink of an eye, he was in front of Ma Hai.

“Pa!”

The extremely fast speed caused Ma Hai to be unable to react in time, and his face received a vicious slap!

This slap only contained Qin Yu’s physical strength, but it shattered Ma Hai’s facial bones!

Fresh blood flowed down from his shattered face!

“How... how could this be...” Ma Hai panicked!

Just his physical strength alone was already so powerful, then how terrifying was his full strength?!

He didn’t dare to imagine!

“Tell me who told you to come, and I’ll let you die a quick death.” Qin Yu was like a demon as he walked step by step towards Ma Hai.

As an old Martial Marquis, Ma Hai had never suffered such humiliation.

He waved his hand, and a long sword appeared in his palm.

The long sword flickered with a dark light in the darkness, and a cold gleam came from the sword. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Black Iron Sword?” The man with the mustache raised his eyebrows.

Then, he shouted to Qin Yu, “This is Black Iron Sword. It can cut iron like mud. You must be careful.”

Qin Yu ignored him and continued to look at Ma Hai coldly.

Ma Hai gritted his teeth and said coldly, “I want to see how strong your body is!”

After he said that, Ma Hai’s qi energy began to fluctuate, and countless internal qi surged into the sword!

“Buzz!”

The blade of the sword suddenly flashed, and dark qi energy rippled on the sword.

“Go to h*ll!” Ma Hai roared, and the sword in his hand slashed at Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s eyes turned cold. He suddenly reached out his hand and grabbed the blade!

Ma Hai was overjoyed!

He had used this sword to destroy a mountain, let alone Qin Yu’s body!

“You will pay the price for your arrogance!” Ma Hai roared crazily!

“Clang.”

However, in the next second, Ma Hai’s expression froze on his face!

Qin Yu’s palm flashed with golden light, and the blade of the sword was forcefully grabbed by his hand.

Traces of blood flowed down Qin Yu’s palm, but Ma Hai couldn’t move it a single inch!

“To be able to cut through my skin, it’s indeed a good sword,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Ma Hai’s eyes widened, and his face was filled with shock!

He had never seen such a tough body in his entire life!

“The chaotic body is really freaky.” The man with the mustache couldn’t help but shrug his shoulders.

Ma Hai’s expression was extremely gloomy. He immediately threw down the sword and shot backward!

“I must not let this guy touch me.” Ma Hai took a deep breath.

Then, there was a burst of light under Ma Hai’s feet. Rays of light spread out in all directions with his feet as the center.

In a few short moments, this light covered a radius of several hundred meters!

Ma Hai took a deep breath. Then, his body became extremely light!

“This guy’s physical body has reached an unimaginable level, but it’s not impossible to kill him.” Ma Hai thought to himself.

“As long as I keep a distance from him and use a spell, I will definitely be able to kill him!”

Qin Yu saw through Ma Hai’s intentions and said coldly, “You keep saying that you’re some old Martial Marquis, but now, you can’t even get close to me? Is that all you have?”

Ma Hai sneered and said, “So what? Killing people doesn’t necessarily depend on strength, and brains are also very important!”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “Your idea isn’t bad, but unfortunately, it’s useless against me.”

As he spoke, Qin Yu used Shrinking Ground Into An Inch and rushed towards Ma Hai!

But what was surprising was that Ma Hai’s figure suddenly disappeared from where he was and he quickly hid a few meters away!

His speed was even faster than Shrinking Ground Into An Inch’s speed!

“Hahahaha!” Ma Hai couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“Qin Yu, so what if you’re powerful? You can’t touch me at all!” Ma Hai was extremely proud.

“But I can use spells to slowly exhaust you to death!”

After saying that, Ma Hai suddenly pushed forward with both hands, and a terrifying force came from all directions!

Ma Hai relied on his spells to continuously attack Qin Yu.

Every time Qin Yu tried to approach him, his figure would quickly disappear.

In the blink of an eye, Ma Hai had already cast hundreds of spells!

Even though Qin Yu’s physical body was strong, under thess spells, his body was still in pain, and many wounds appeared.

“It worked.” Ma Hai couldn’t help but sneer.

At this moment, Ma Hai finally relaxed.

He smiled and said, “Qin Yu, to tell you the truth, in the Martial Marquis realm, I have never lost. Unless you’re a Martial Saint, you can forget about defeating me!”
