Chapter 160: Are You Here to Tickle Me? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

A blue flame was dancing in Qin Yu’s palm.

Even though they were several meters apart, they could still feel the intense power.

“Blue... blue spiritual fire?” Luo Jian’s face instantly turned pale when he saw this spiritual fire. A sense of powerlessness appeared in his heart!

The people below the stage who were in the know suddenly stood up and stared at Qin Yu’s palm!

“That... that’s blue spiritual fire. It’s really blue!”

“Blue spiritual fire... it really exists!”

“Who is that young man?! How could he possess blue spiritual fire?!”

Even Zhou Tong plopped down on the ground with a look of despair on his face!

Qin Yu was a little surprised.

These people seemed to be a little afraid... of the spiritual fire in his hand?

“This is impossible, absolutely impossible!” Beads of sweat dripped down Luo Jian’s forehead.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “What do you mean? Could it be that your spiritual fire is different from mine?”

Luo Jian gritted his teeth and berated him, “Don’t pretend to be ignorant!”

This made Qin Yu even more puzzled. What exactly was going on?

“Rumor has it that spiritual fires are divided into seven grades, red, orange, yellow, green, green, blue, and purple.” At this time, an elder below the stage suddenly said.

“Among them, red is the lowest grade and purple is the highest grade, but those are all rumors. No one has seen them before. Most people produce spiritual fires that are red.”

“I didn’t expect there to really be blue spiritual fires.”

After hearing his explanation, Qin Yu suddenly came to a realization.

In other words, other than purple, this blue flame was the highest grade?

“No wonder the power of this flame is so intense,” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

At this moment, Luo Jian’s ego was bruised!

He simply couldn’t imagine that Qin Yu would actually possess a blue spiritual fire! Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Once this news spreads, he will definitely become the focus of the pharmacist world.” Someone commented secretly.

“I’m afraid it’s not just the pharmacist world. He will be greatly respected even the martial arts world and might be targeted as well.”

“A man’s wealth is his own ruin by causing other’s greed..”

Everyone lamented repeatedly, but Qin Yu was the only one who didn’t take it seriously.

At this moment, there were only ten minutes left until the end.

If he relied on ordinary flames, it would be too late.

“It seems that I can only try to use this spiritual fire.” Qin Yu felt a little helpless.

He wasn’t familiar with how to control this spiritual fire, and the slightest negligicence could cause the herbs to get burned.

But now, Qin Yu had no other way, so he could only take the risk.

Then, Qin Yu raised his palm and flicked his finger.

A wisp of spiritual fire fell into the pot.

The moment the fire fell into the pot, crisp sizzling sounds were heard!

Qin Yu didn’t dare to be distracted. He closed his eyes and focused all his attention on the spiritual fire.

This not only consumed Qin Yu’s physical strength, but also consumed a lot of mental strength.

The medicinal paste in the pot began to slowly condense! Rays of light suddenly appeared in it! It was a beautiful scenery!

Zhou Tong gritted his teeth. He stared at Qin Yu on the stage and suddenly shouted, “Luo Jian! The control of the spiritual fire requires concentration. The slightest negligicence could cause the herbs to get burned!”

Although he wasn’t very explicit, his intention was very obvious.

Luo Jian was a smart person. He sneered and said, “I understand.”

After saying that, Luo Jian looked at Qin Yu and sneered. “I won’t let you refine medicine in peace.”

Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, Luo Jian actually clenched his fist and charged at Qin Yu! He wanted to use this to distract Qin Yu!

Mr. Yangwas instantly dumbfounded. He glared at Luo Jian and roared angrily, “You... you guys are cheating! How shameless!”

Zhou Tong turned a blind eye to it. Instead, he pulled aside a few of the judges and started chatting on the stage.

Mr. Yang was furious, but there was nothing he could do!

On the stage, Luo Jian kept punching Qin Yu’s body.

However, what shocked Luo Jian was that his punches couldn’t affect Qin Yu at all. Instead, they made his wrist hurt!

“This... how is this possible?!” Luo Jian was getting more and more anxious. He seemed to have gone mad. He used both his fists and legs to kick and punch Qin Yu’s body.

As time passed, Qin Yu still kept his eyes closed and ignored Luo Jian.

All his attention was focused on controlling the spiritual fire.

“Zhou Tong is really shameless.” Someone below the stage couldn’t help but snort.

“It’s a pity that his disciple can’t hurt Qin Yu at all.”

“Stop joking. Even a master like Hong Wu was defeated by Qin Yu, let alone Luo Jian.”

Time flew by quickly, and there was only one minute left before the end.

Below the stage, Zhou Tong looked at Qin Yu coldly, and he felt a little uneasy.

“I can’t let this kid continue to develop,” Zhou Tong thought to himself.

An Inner Strength Past Master with blue spiritual fire wasn’t someone he, Zhou Tong, could afford to offend!

Luo Jian still didn’t give up. He clenched his fist and punched Qin Yu’s vital point!

It was also at this moment that Qin Yu’s eyes suddenly opened!

He turned to look at Luo Jian and said with a nonchalant smile, “Are you here to tickle me? What, you didn’t eat enough for lunch?”
