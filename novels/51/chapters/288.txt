Chapter 289: I’ll Fight You! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Both sides’ internal qi was rising rapidly.

The two of them collided.

Clanging sounds kept ringing in their ears, and strong gusts of wind blew around them. Sand and stones flew everywhere. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Qin Yu frowned. Although neither of them attacked, Qin Yu could clearly feel that Chi Feng’s internal qi was above that of Gu Taichu.

“Gu Taichu, die!” Chi Feng shouted and his body suddenly disappeared! In the blink of an eye, his fist arrived in front of Gu Taichu!

Gu Taichu didn’t give in and raised his fist to meet it!

“Boom!”

This was a huge collision that sent Yao Qing flying!

Qin Yu also took a few steps back to stabilize his body!

Gu Taichu’s expression wasn’t too good. This punch had obviously injured his wrist.

On the other hand, Chi Feng had his hands behind his back and looked extremely calm.

Seeing this, Qin Yu hurriedly walked forward and stood in front of Gu Taichu.

“Chi Feng, Master Gu is your master after all. Do you want to kill your master?” Qin Yu said coldly.

Chi Feng sneered. “What does it have to do with you? After I kill Gu Taichu, I’ll kill you next!”

Qin Yu was so angry that he said, “If you really want to find someone to show off your power, I’ll fight with you in a week.”

“Qin Yu, you...” Gu Taichu’s expression suddenly changed and he looked at Qin Yu in panic.

Qin Yu waved his hand and interrupted Gu Taichu’s words.

“Master Gu, I have my own plans,” Qin Yu said.

Then, Qin Yu looked at Chi Feng and said, “Do you dare to?”

Chi Feng narrowed his eyes and said, “With just your abilities? You’re really a good lap dog. Why? Do you want to die for Gu Taichu?”

Qin Yu said coldly, “You only need to answer yes or no.”

Chi Feng laughed and said, “Why wouldn’t I dare? Since you’re willing to die for him, why would I refuse? After all, Gu Taichu is my master.”

Chi Feng laughed coldly inside.

If he killed Gu Taichu, he would probably be branded as a murderer.

However, if he killed Qin Yu, not only would he be able to establish his authority, but he could also claim that he was taking revenge for Gu Jinhong.

“Alright, I’ll see you in a week,” Qin Yu said coldly.

After saying that, Qin Yu looked at Gu Taichu and said, “Master Gu, let’s go.”

Gu Taichu was a little unwilling and glared at Chi Feng.

If looks could kill, Chi Feng would have died ten thousand times already.

Qin Yu brought Gu Taichu and left.

After returning, Gu Taichu couldn’t help but ask, “Qin Yu, with your current strength, it’s impossible for you to defeat Chi Feng.”

“Moreover, your talent is much higher than his. If you have an accident now, it won’t be worth it.”

Qin Yu smiled. “Master Gu, don’t worry. I’ve already thought of a way to deal with it.”

Qin Yu actually didn’t know the so-called way to deal with it.

All he could rely on was formations and cultivation methods.

The reason why he said he had a way to deal with it was to comfort Gu Taichu.

Ever since Gu Taichu told him about his relationship with his father, Qin Yu had a subtle feeling of kinship towards Gu Taichu.

Gu Taichu had arranged a mansion for Qin Yu.

It had to be said that the Gu family’s courtyard was very large.

Moreover, the environment of the oriental-style building was also quite pleasant.

While sitting in his own mansion, Qin Yu looked at Yao Qing.

“Yao Qing, I plan to enter closed-door cultivation for the next few days. If there’s nothing important, don’t disturb me,” said Qin Yu.

Yao Qing nodded and said, “Mr. Qin, don’t worry. Even if I have to risk my life, I can protect you.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He took out the Divine Medicine from his Spatial Magic Artifact.

Looking at this Divine Medicine, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little reluctant.

“I originally wanted to improve my strength and use it to refine medicine, but now, it seems that it’s too late,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Qin Yu had a lot of medicinal pills, and among them, there was no lack of Divine Rank pill formulas.

However, with Qin Yu’s current strength, the possibility of him refining a Divine Rank pill was extremely small, and the risk was ridiculously high.

Therefore, Qin Yu could only settle for the second best and use it to refine an Earth Rank pill.

‘If this single herb can refine several Earth Rank pills, then it won’t be a waste,’ Qin Yu thought to himself.

Following that, he closed his eyes and browsed through the pill formulas in his mind.

Countless pill formulas flashed through Qin Yu’s mind. Qin Yu carefully selected and finally chose the pill formula called the Vitality Enhancing Pill.

The effect of the Vitality Enhancing Pill wasn’t much different from that of the Foundation Establishment Pill. The only difference was that the Vitality Enhancing Pill could be used at any stage.

Even a great cultivator at the Tribulation Stage could use the Vitality Enhancing Pill. Of course, the effect was negligible.

After choosing the pill formula, streams of spiritual fire lit up on Qin Yu’s palm.

Qin Yu didn’t have any specialized pill refining utensils, so he could only borrow ordinary cooking utensils.

The spiritual fire burned fiercely in the cooking utensils. When Gu Taichu saw this, he couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise, “This is a spiritual fire?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “That’s right.”

When Gu Taichu heard this, he couldn’t help but exclaim, “You have the second strongest spiritual fire I’ve ever seen.”

“Second?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but be stunned.

Could it be that there was someone who possessed the purple flame?

Gu Taichu nodded and said, “Back then, your father also used it once, and it was a purple flame.”

Qin Yu was speechless.

Refining a pill required concentration, and the slightest carelessness could result in the herbs burning.

Therefore, Qin Yu asked Gu Taichu and the others to leave for the time being, and then he began to control the spiritual fire to refine the Vitality Enhancing Pill.

Fortunately, Qin Yu’s ability to control the fire had greatly improved. He also had some experience in controlling the fire.

Therefore, the process of refining the Vitality Enhancing Pill was extremely smooth.

The Divine Medicine slowly turned into a paste in the Spatial Magic Artifact. A natural spiritual energy instantly filled the entire room.

For an entire day, Qin Yu sat in the room without moving an inch.

It wasn’t until the next morning that all the spiritual energy began to converge and slowly take shape in the Spatial Magic Artifact!

With a low roar from Qin Yu, the Spatial Magic Artifact immediately exploded!

Then, the Danyun Phenomenon appeared in the sky!

This time, the Danyun Phenomenon, covering almost half of the sky, was much thicker and heavier than the last time!

Many people were stunned by this bizarre scene!

Dong Tianhai, who was hundreds of kilometers away, also saw this bizarre scene!

“It’s almost the same as when the Nine Transformation Golden Pill was born that day!” Dong Tianhai couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise.

“Could it be Qin Yu?” Dong Tianhai murmured in a low voice.

He looked in the direction of the Danyun Phenomenon and said in a low voice, “It’s in the direction of Bin Province. Could it be Qin Yu really came to Bin Province to look for Gu Taichu?”

Thinking of this, Dong Tianhai immediately arranged for people to prepare a car to go to Bin Province!

Not only Dong Tianhai, but even the Divine Alchemist Pavilion also noticed this scene.

“Who is refining medicine? He can actually form an Earth Rank Danyun Phenomenon?” For a moment, the Divine Alchemist Pavilion was similarly stunned by this bizarre scene!
