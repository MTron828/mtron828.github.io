Chapter 1095: Chapter 1095, the Proud Gong Tianyu 

The others were not like Qin Yu. They were enjoying themselves on the cruise ship.

“Five days is really boring.”On the deck, Xiao Yuan shook his head helplessly.

Chu hedao said quietly, “Five days is nothing to us.”

“Brother Chu, you are wrong. The longer the journey, the more you should know your dao heart,”Xiao Yuan said with a smile.

Chu Hedao looked at Xiao Yuan, his eyes shining with a bright light. He stared at Xiao Yuan and asked, “What is brother Xiao’s Dao Heart?”

A trace of surprise flashed in Xiao Yuan’s eyes, and then he said with a smile, “Dao Heart, Dao Heart, naturally you must know it in your heart. How can you say it verbally?”

Xiao Yuan obviously wanted to prevaricate, but Chu Hedao seemed to want to get to the bottom of it.

He looked at Xiao Yuan coldly and said, “Brother Xiao’s Dao Heart is extremely extraordinary. It’s hard to understand.”

Xiao Yuan laughed loudly and said, “There are thousands of paths. Everyone has their own different Dao. What’s so strange about this?”

“Brother Xiao, did you receive some inheritance?”At this moment, Chu Hedao suddenly asked.

Hearing this, Xiao Yuan’s expression instantly became somewhat unnatural, but it only lasted for a moment.

He smiled and said, “Our Xiao family doesn’t have any powerful inheritance.”

Chu Hedao’s eyes flickered, and no one knew what he was thinking.

“Our understanding of martial families should be far inferior to brother Xiao’s. If we can obtain any powerful inheritance, you must inform us,”Chu Hedao said in a deep voice.

After saying this, Chu Hedao didn’t say anything else and turned around to leave.

Xiao Yuan watched Chu Hedao’s back as his eyes flashed with a trace of coldness.

...

The news that the holy region was about to be opened spread like wildfire, and the martial arts forum instantly spread as well.

Tianji zi personally sent this news to the martial arts forum.

“The holy region’s passageway has long been closed, but Night View Avenue has learned that the holy region’s passageway will be opened soon, and it’s been opened by humans,”Tianji Zi said.

Someone below asked, “By humans? who has such great ability? Qin Yu? or those eight higher-ups?”

Tianji zi replied, “None of them. None of them have such great ability.”

As soon as these words were said, the entire martial arts forum was in an uproar.

The news that the higher-ups were at the Almighty Realm had long spread. Even they didn’t have such great ability? Then who was the one who opened the Holy Region Passage? Could it be an existence that surpassed the Almighty Realm?

Someone continued to ask, wanting to get to the bottom of the matter, but Tian Jizi didn’t reply.

“The Holy Region has opened. Presumably, those who can head to the holy region are also geniuses.”

“The group led by Qin Yu will definitely head to the Holy Region first.”

“One step at a time, one step at a time. I’m afraid we’ll never be able to catch up to these people.”

“It might not be a good thing. The holy region might not be able to accommodate them. That kind of place obeys the law of the jungle. It’s not safe to go there.”

Everyone discussed animatedly, but they seemed to be filled with curiosity and yearning for the holy region.

On the cruise ship, Qin Yu was still slowly absorbing the power of the divine sense in the jar.

It had to be said that the aura provided by the jar was indeed unrivaled. Even the purest internal Qi could not be compared to it.

The cruise ship was sailing on the sea.

Compared to the vast sea, the cruise ship looked extremely small, like a small boat.

The people on the ship looked into the distance, holding wine glasses in their hands. They were quite pleased with themselves.

“I wonder if we will encounter any danger on this trip to the Cloud Dragon Island,”Yao Meng said.

“Danger is inevitable. Didn’t you say that no martial saint has ever left the Cloud Dragon Island?”Zhuang Teng said.

The crowd remained silent. Although they were filled with yearning for the cloud dragon island, at the same time, they were also faintly worried.

Right at this moment, Gong Tianyu walked over while swaying his wine cup.

He smiled faintly and said, “Martial friends, are you discussing martial arts?”

Gong Tianyu’s words carried a bit of sarcasm, and his gaze was incomparably disdainful.

Yao Meng couldn’t help but laugh and say, “Mister Gong, although we love martial arts, it doesn’t mean that our other conveniences are inferior to yours.”

“If we really talk about it, everyone here has strength above yours.”

When Gong Tianyu heard this, he couldn’t help but Snort coldly. “Is that so? I know you guys are from Jingdu, and they say that Jingdu’s people are all-powerful. I’d really like to see them.”

Yao Meng raised her eyebrows and said, “Are you serious?”

Gong Tianyu laughed loudly and said, “I’ve always kept my word. Of course, I see that you’re somewhat beautiful. If you’re willing to spend the night with me, I might be able to take back what I said just now.”

As soon as he said that, the expressions of the people who were making love instantly turned ugly.

“Without Qin Yu, I want to see who can stop me,”Chang Mang said with a dark face.

Seeing this, Zhuang Teng hurriedly stopped Chang Mang.

However, Chang Mang shook his arms and directly pushed Zhuang Teng to the side.

“Are you trying to scare me?”Gong Tianyu was not afraid at all, and the bodyguards beside him took a step forward.

Chang Mang had long lost his patience. Among this group of people, besides Qin Yu, there was probably no one else who could stop him. Therefore, no one said anything more.

“HMM?”

At this moment, Yao Meng suddenly frowned slightly.

“It seems that someone is approaching us.”Yao Meng said with a frown.

Chang Mang frowned slightly. He stopped his footsteps and looked in a certain direction. The others also released their divine sense.

“As expected.”Kong Yun’s face darkened.

“There are more than ten people approaching us. Among them, there’s a martial saint and many ordinary people.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“I didn’t expect to meet a martial saint here. I really don’t know how many martial saints still exist in this world.”

Gong tianyu sneered, “There’s no end to the sea. How can there be anyone? If you want to change the topic, just say it.”

The crowd ignored him, treating him as a fool.

Yao Meng’s eyes looked into the distance. About half an hour later, a ship appeared in front of them.

The ship rushed over and blocked the front of the cruise ship.

There was a flag on the ship, and on the flag was a picture of a shark.

Seeing the ship, the face of a middle-aged man beside him changed drastically.

“Oh no, we still met them!”The middle-aged man’s face was ashen.

Yao Meng asked, “Who are they?”

The middle-aged man gulped and said, “They are notorious pirates in the nearby waters. Many cargo ships that pass through here have been hijacked by them. Not only do they want money, they also want their lives...”

“What are you afraid of?”Gong Tianyu snorted.

He looked at the bodyguard beside him and said indifferently, “I hired them at a high price. How can I be afraid of them!”

After saying that, Gong Tianyu patted the bodyguard’s shoulder and said, “I’ll leave it to you.”

The bodyguard nodded slightly and said, “Don’t worry.”
