2134 The Vision of the Path of Heaven

“Do you think he would be so stupid to bring the Traceless Immortal Scripture with him?” First Elder shook his head.

Hearing this, the three fell silent.

“This Qin Yu is right in front of us, but we can’t get the Traceless Immortal Scripture from him.” Another linen-robed elderly man let out a long sigh.

“As long as the Si family can get it, then everyone in the world can get it. Just wait and see,” First Elder said with a faint smile.

Although the three were somewhat unwilling, they did not say anything further because they knew First Elder was right.

The warship continued to rush toward where the Path of Heaven would arrive. At this moment, Qin Yu was sitting cross-legged absorbing the dao technique. He wanted to take the opportunity to advance.

No one knew who would be the person the day of the Path of Heaven would fall upon. However, it was fair for everyone in terms of comprehending the dao technique from it.

It was a pursuit of the Path of Heaven. Everyone was looking for their own opportunities, and Qin Yu was no exception. And those seemingly insignificant contradictions and conflicts might be the catalyst for him to become a True Saint.

To Qin Yu, whether it was his identity as a prisoner in the hands of the Ni Family or the pursuers of the Traceless Immortal Scripture, they were just stepping stones for him to reach a higher realm. Therefore, he would not be swayed by the predicament before him, nor would he be moved by other people’s words.

Even though he was in a dangerous situation, his heart was as calm as water. He knew that as long as he could seize the opportunity, he could achieve great things.

The incredible power the warship represented was only one of the obstacles to his growth. He would break through all obstacles and find the Path of Heaven that truly belonged to him, and became a true expert.

However, the path of the Path of Heaven was never a straight line, but a path full of twists and turns. Every twist and turn could become his motivation to move forward, or an obstacle for him to move forward.

Qin Yu was not only facing obstruction from the Si family but also greed and schemes from all parties. Whether it was the Ni family’s First Elder or those pursuers of the Traceless Immortal Scripture, they were all coveting his treasures.

Qin Yu knew that he could not let them target him. He had to use his actions and wisdom to let them know that he was not their prey, nor was he their sacrifice.

He was Qin Yu. He was a person who pursued the Path of Heaven. He was a future expert.

All of this required him to use his actions and wisdom to fight for it and prove it.

This was his path, his road. He would walk step by step toward his own Path of Heaven.

As time passed, the dao technique became more intense. One could even easily capture the dao techniques in the void.

A strange scene appeared in the prison. Qin Yu’s body was wrapped in golden threads one after another. These threads seemed to be attracted by Qin Yu as they continuously circled around his body. In the end, they formed a tremendously gorgeous golden scene.

Outside the prison, the linen-robed elderly man could not help but frown when he saw this scene.

“This kid can actually use the dao technique to such an extent!” a linen-robed elderly man said in a deep voice.

“We can’t let him live. Otherwise, he will definitely become a great enemy of our Ni family in the future!” the other linen-robed elderly man said worriedly.

Once he was allowed to grow, its future would definitely be boundless! No one could predict how terrifying a chosen one who grew up under the great era would be!

Even First Elder could not help but somewhat be stunned as if he could not believe the scene in front of him.

“If we can’t befriend him, we can’t let him live,” First Elder slightly sighed with emotion and said.

Although he said that, First Elder did not take any action.

He turned around and left, no longer paying attention to Qin Yu who was comprehending the dao technique in the prison.

Time passed by, and the warship had already been flying in the sky for three days.

In these three days, Qin Yu’s comprehension and perception of the dao technique became even more profound. The golden threads became even brighter as they revolved around his body. It was as if they had formed a golden tower that was extremely mysterious and solemn.

Those linen-robed elderly men would come over to check on Qin Yu’s condition every day. But each time, it would make them even more worried because they knew while Qin Yu’s potential was getting bigger and bigger, his growth speed was also getting faster. To them, this was undoubtedly a tremendous threat.

On this day, Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes. He sensed the surrounding dao technique and muttered in a low voice, “It’s about time. This place shouldn’t be far from the place where the Path of Heaven arrives.”

After saying that, a wisp of Qin Yu’s divine sense flew out from his glabella and immediately fled the warship.

Through this wisp of divine sense, Qin Yu looked ahead of him.

There was a sea of people ahead of him. There were even dao techniques overflowing on the huge mountain not far away. The surroundings seemed to have formed a barrier that prevented people from approaching.

In the sky, an incredibly terrifying vision of the Path of Heaven was flickering.

The vision in the sky was like a magnificent astronomical phenomenon, both astonishing and horrifying. It was as if a mysterious door had opened in the sky, attracting the attention of countless people.

The layers of clouds were torn apart as if endless power was released from within. Waves of strong dao energy descended from the sky, like a river pouring down endlessly. Not only was there dense dao energy flowing in it, but it also contained endless truths. It was like a scripture of the Great Dao that had created the heavens and the earth, reciting in the universe.

In the celestial river, stars were shining and starlight falling as if performing a brilliant musical score. The stars were rotating as if they were telling some mysterious way, amazing people.

Further in the distance, after the dazzling lights of the stars collided with each other, they formed a huge vortex as if a galaxy was spinning in the sky. Around the vortex of stars, space and time shattered, and chaotic energy leaked out. It was as if another world was connected to this place, and visions kept flashing within.

It was a magnificent vision of the Path of Heaven as if announcing an unprecedented storm was about to arrive. Furthermore, the ripples caused by this power were so powerful that they shook people’s hearts. It was as if everything in the world was trembling at this moment.

For a moment, Qin Yu was shocked beyond words! He had never seen such a terrifying spectacle before!

In the prison, Qin Yu could not help but mutter “Is this the vision of the Path of Heaven…”

On the day the Path of Heaven descended, a densely packed crowd stretches as far as the eye could not see the end of it.

“It’s time to leave this place.” Qin Yu slightly narrowed his eyes, and the corners of his mouth curled up into a cold smile.
