Chapter 1720: Stepping into Xihuang Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

A sharp voice pierced through the sky. In an instant, the entire area was silent!

The surrounding people’s ears were hurt by this angry shout and blood was flowing out!

“Did Qin Yu come?”

“Could it be that Yong Ji has found Qin Yu?”

“Impossible! Qin Yu must be crazy to come at this time!

Everyone was in a heated discussion. Yong Ji’s gaze swept across the surroundings. His sharp gaze pierced through the void, and no one could hide from it.

At this moment, a voice suddenly came from the distance.

“Yong Ji, I’ll f*ck your ancestors!”

Everyone was stunned when they heard the voice.

This voice seemed to belong to Qin Yu!

“Qin Yu actually came!”

“I knew he wouldn’t be afraid!”

“Attempting the impossible! As expected of Qin Yu!”

Yong Ji’s expression instantly turned ugly.

It wasn’t because of Qin Yu’s scolding, but because he couldn’t find any trace of Qin Yu at all!

“Yong Ji! You’re shameless! You’re challenging me just because you’ve stepped into the Reversion Void Stage! You’re really shameless!” Qin Yu cursed.

Yong Ji’s face darkened and he said coldly, ” “Since you’re already here, why are you hiding?”

Qi Yu laughed and said, “Aren’t you at the Reversion Void Stage? What? You can’t even find me when I’m here? It seems that you’re a Reversion Void Stage cultivator in name only!”

The veins on Yong Ji’s forehead bulged as he shouted angrily, “I’ve found you! How long are you going to hide?”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “You can’t find me. If you really have the ability, find me. You’re a trash, a lackey of North Plain, and a b*stard. How dare you call yourself a teacher? You’re just a dog. You should change your name to Old Dog Yong Ji!”

The swearings and curses made Yong Ji’s expression turn even uglier.

He gritted his teeth and said, ” Qin Yu, it’s useless to talk. Come out and fight me if you have the ability!”

“I’ll fight your a*s! Before you stepped into the Reversion Void Stage, you hid in North Plain and didn’t dare to come out. Now you’re showing yourpower?” Qin Yu said sarcastically.

“If we were in the same cultivation realm, would you dare to fart like this? Besides, I’m already here. If you can’t find me, then it’s your problem.”

Yong Ji was driven mad by Qin Yu, but he could not find him at all!

“If you still don’t come out, don’t blame me for starting a massacre.” Yong Ji said coldly.

Qin Yu sneered, “What? You’re showing impotent rage again? Yong Ji, that’s all you have.”

“Since you’ve accepted my challenge, why didn’t you show up?” Yong Ji shouted.

“I don’t have to keep my word when dealing with people like you.” Qin Yu laughed and said.

“Also, let me tell you some bad news. I’m about to step into the Reversion Void Stage. When the time comes, I’ll definitely kill you myself!

These words made Yong Ji’s heart sink.

He knew very well that if Qin Yu were to step into the Reversion Void Stage, he would definitely not be his match.

“Alright! I won’t waste any more time with you. I’m leaving now. Hide well in North Plain,” Qin Yu said sarcastically.

At this moment, hundreds of stars away from North Plain, Qin Yu was holding the man with the mustache’s loudspeaker and shouting with all his might.

“This thing is indeed useful.” Qin Yu mumbled as he played with the loudspeaker. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

This object seemed to be able to resonate with the Great Dao. Not only could the sound be transmitted very far away, but it could hear the sound from hundreds of stars away.

After putting away the loudspeaker, Qin Yu planned to leave.

Of course, he wasn’t that stupid. If he were to fight Yong Ji, it would be no different from committing suicide.

After cursing at Yong Ji, Qin Yu rushed straight to Xihuang.

During this period of time, Xihuang had been in turmoil constantly.

The most powerful clan in Xihuang was the Chao Sect, which was founded by the two brothers of the Chao family.

In the past few days, they had repeatedly sent out signals to Nanzhou, and they were all targeting Xiao Sheng.

This was bad news for Nanzhou.

“Rumor has it that Xihuang is extremely powerful now. The Chao Sect has obtained some terrifying inheritance and has almost unified the entire Xihuang.”

“That’s right. I heard that Chao Sect has thirteen Reversion Void Stage cultivators now and this number is still increasing!”

“Thirteen Reversion Void Stage cultivators? This is too terrifying! Even our vast Nanzhou is far behind such a terrifying number.”

“Once North Plain and Xihuang attack at the same time, I’m afraid Nanzhou will be divided up.”

“Who cares if they divide up? What we’re afraid of is that they’ll attack us.”

The huge face that appeared in the sky caused everyone to panic.

The strength of Xihuang had also become even more mysterious as the news spread. Now, everyone’s fear of Xihuang was no less than that of North Plain.

…

At the border between Xihuang and Nanzhou.

This place used to have a dead river that separated the two great provinces.

However, after the dead river disappeared, there was no such thing as a boundary.

But the moment one stepped into Xihuang, the scenery was completely different.

If Nanzhou was an oasis, then Xihunag was an extremely cold desert.

“Is this Xihuangt?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

Although it was not as barren as Donghuang, it was way much far awayfrom prosperity when compared with Nanzhou.

At a glance, there was almost no one in sight.

After walking for a long time, Qin Yu finally saw a city.

There were a few words written on the city wall–Pilgrimage City.

Without even thinking, it must have been built by the two brothers from the Chao family.

“Pilgrimage City. How boastful!” Qin Yu could not help but wrinkle his nose.

Perhaps it was because Xihuang was so barren, and Pilgrimage City didn’t have any defense at the border. So it was easy to enter.

After entering Pilgrimage City, only then did Qin Yu notice the difference.

It was a full-fledged city. Almost everyone in Xihuang gathered here.

However, there weren’t many people in Pilgrimage City. Compared to Nanzhou, there was a huge difference.

“Where is the dark energy that Xiao Sheng spoke of?” Qin Yu could not help but frown.

He released his divine sense, but he did not detect any dark energy at all.

Under Qin Yu’s divine sense, he did detect the presence of many Reversion Void Stage cultivators.

“Strange.” Qin Yu touched his chin.

The spiritual energy in Pilgrimage City was not rich, so what did they rely on to cultivate?

“Could it be… that the dark energy Xiao Sheng mentioned isn’t in Pilgrimage City?” Qin Yu thought to himself.

After thinking for a while, Qin Yu finally decided to find a place to ask.

Therefore, Qin Yu found a teahouse and sat down.

There were not many people in the teahouse.

Holding a cup of tea, Qin Yu picked a man who looked relatively kind and walked over.

“Hello, Sir.” Qin Yu sat across from him.

The old man glanced at Qin Yu and nodded casually.

Qin Yu first tried to get close to the old man, and then they had a casual chat. The atmosphere was quite harmonious, and the conversation was quite pleasant.

However, what Qin Yu didn’t know was that he had been detected the moment he stepped into Pilgrimage City.
