Chapter 212: You Guys Should Be Expelled! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Meeting Qin Yu’s gaze, Yao Man suddenly felt a sense of confidence.

She pointed at the little boy and said, “He... he bullied me every day. He lifted my skirt and forced me to be his servant. If I didn’t agree, he would tear up my homework book...”

“Today, he fought with me for my homework book and accidentally fell down. He said that I hit him...”

When he heard Yao Man’s words, the chubby woman at the side immediately cursed, “Bullsh*t, you’re talking nonsense!”

Yao Qing ignored the chubby woman and said anxiously, “Why didn’t you tell the teacher?”

“The teacher didn’t care at all...” Yao Man said timidly.

Yao Qing couldn’t help but be a little angry. He looked at the chubby woman and said, “You heard it. It was clearly your son who bullied my sister!”

“Bullsh*t!” The chubby woman cursed.

She pointed at Yao Man’s nose and scolded, “Little b*tch, if you dare to talk nonsense again, I will tear your mouth apart!”

Yao Man was so scared that her body trembled. She hid behind Yao Qing.

“This lady, please be more polite. Don’t call him a little b*tch,” Yao Qing said while holding back his anger.

The chubby woman sneered. “I called her a little b*tch. What can you do about it?”

Yao Qing’s expression was a little ugly. He opened his mouth and was about to speak when Qin Yu slapped the chubby woman’s face!

“You don’t need to be reasonable with this kind of person. Sometimes, violence is the best way to solve problems,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The chubby woman, disbelief written all over her face, covered her face.

“You... you dared to hit me?” The chubby woman was instantly furious.

“Do you know who I am?” The chubby woman said fiercely.

Qin Yu sneered. “I don’t care who you are. If you dare to talk nonsense again, I will break your mouth.”

“You!” The chubby woman flew into a rage, but when she met Qin Yu’s eyes, she cowered.

“What’s going on?”

At this moment, a woman wearing a business suit hurried over from the school.

Seeing this woman, the chubby woman hurriedly said, “Mrs. Zhang, this little b*tch is bullying my son. Tell me what to do!”

“Mrs. Zhang, you came at the right time.” Yao Qing also hurried over.

He told Mrs. Zhang what happened.

Mrs. Zhang couldn’t help but frown slightly.

“Mrs. Zhang, this child bullies my sister every day. You have to take care of this matter.” Yao Qing said in a sullen voice.

Mrs. Zhang glanced at Yao Qing and said with a cold expression, “Why is he bullying your sister instead of others? You have to let your sister reflect on her own problems. You can’t always blame others, understand?”

She was simply being unreasonable.

When he heard these words, Yao Qing’s expression also became a little ugly.

“Mrs. Zhang, this little b*tch hit my son. What do you think we should do about this matter?” The chubby woman snorted coldly.

Mrs. Zhang looked at the chubby woman and immediately changed her expression.

She smiled apologetically and said, “Mrs. Li, don’t worry. I will definitely report this matter to the higher-ups and expel Yao Man!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“That’s more like it,” the chubby woman said proudly.

Qin Yu, who was standing at the side, couldn’t listen anymore.

He said with a cold expression, “Are your ears stuffed with donkey hair? This little fatty bullied Yao Man. It’s bad enough that you didn’t punish this little fatty, but you even want to expel my sister?”

Mrs. Zhang glanced at Qin Yu and said with a cold expression, “Please speak with respect. This is a school. Why are you so uncultured?”

“Uncultured?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes.

“You are a teacher, but you can’t be fair and just. I think you are the one who is uncultured.” Qin Yu said coldly.

When she heard this, Mrs. Zhang decided to shed all pretense of cordiality. She snorted and said, “Ms. Li’s hubby is the director of our school. If you aren’t satisfied, go to the director and tell him. Don’t argue with me here!”

“So that’s the case.” Qin Yu suddenly understood.

He sneered and said, “I really didn’t expect that even the school would trample on the students. A person like you isn’t worthy of being a teacher.”

“Whether I am worthy or not is not up to you to decide.” Mrs. Zhang snorted lightly.

Qin Yu looked at Mrs. Zhang coldly and said, “You can scram. This school doesn’t welcome you.”

“Doesn’t welcome me? Haha, who do you think you are?” Mrs. Zhang couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

The chubby woman at the side also said proudly, “Mrs. Zhang, don’t worry. I’ll call my hubby in a while and ask him to give you a raise!”

“Gee, then I really have to thank you, Mrs. Li!” Mrs. Zhang said excitedly.

Qin Yu glanced at the chubby woman and sneered. “There’s no need for your hubby to stay in the school anymore.”

“Hahaha, I’m dying of laughter. Who do you think you are? You’re too big for your britches! My hubby is the director. Besides the principal, he has the highest position!” Ms. Li snorted.

“But as for this little b*tch, let’s see which school in Chuzhou dares to take her!”

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold. He immediately took out his phone and called Jiang Gu.

“Ask the principal of Ruisi Primary School to meet me at the gate,” Qin Yu said coldly.

After saying this, Qin Yu hung up the phone.

“Ask our principal to meet you? I think you’re out of your mind.” Mrs. Zhang said while holding back her laughter.

“Our principal has a lot of things to attend to and deals with the upper class people every day. How can you meet him as you wish?”

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered with her at all.

The biggest shareholder of this school was Jiang Gu.

In other words, Qin Yu was also one of the shareholders of this school.

A mere director wasn’t worth mentioning at all.

“Let’s hurry up and leave...” Yao Man seemed to be a little afraid.

Yao Qing hurriedly bent down and comforted her, “Don’t be afraid, it’s fine. Qin Yu is very powerful.”

As they were speaking, a BMW 5 Series drove out of the school.

The chubby woman became even more excited when she saw the car.

“Honey, you finally came out!” The chubby woman said excitedly.

As the car stopped, a man with slicked back hair came out.

“Mr. Wang, you’are here,” Mrs. Zhang said respectfully.

The man who was called Mr. Wang glanced at her and frowned. “What happened?”

Mrs. Zhang hurriedly said, “This student is bullying your son. I’m planning to expel her!”

Mr. Wang nodded and said impatiently, “Then quickly expel her. Don’t crowd around the school gate. It won’t be good for the school.”

“Alright, I understand,” Mrs. Zhang quickly said.

Then, she looked at Qin Yu and said while glaring at him, “Did you hear that? Our director said that Yao Man has been expelled! You guys can scram!”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

The world was really full of unjust.

“I think you guys should be expelled.” At this moment, a man in formal clothes ran out of the school anxiously.
