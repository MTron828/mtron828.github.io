Chapter 703: The Secret of the Mystic Realm! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Originally, Qin Yu had planned to bring Xiao Yu to Qing City. However, he was concerned that the people of the Hong Yi Sect would notice the strangeness of Xiao Yu. Thus he could only give up the plan.

On the following day.

Qin Yu rushed to Qing City early in the morning.

Qing City was a relatively marginalized city.

It was said that this city used to be very glorious. However, it gradually declined without any signs.

The local government had thought of many ways to revive it, whether it was by attracting investment or inviting the Feng Shui masters, but they were all ineffective.

Many businessmen who came to invest ended up losing everything.

Due to this, Qing City was named the other name, the Cursed City.

Qin Yu sat at the airport, and his eyes were scanning the surroundings.

The airport was huge, but there were very few people, which did not fit the size of the airport.

Qin Yu frowned. He released his divine sense, trying to sense something, but he couldn’t.

“It’s strange,” Qin Yu touched his chin.

There was nothing unusual about this city. There wasn’t any special dark energy, but it just couldn’t be developed.

“Could it be... because of that mystic realm?” Qin Yu thought to himself.

At this moment, Su Qian patted Qin Yu’s shoulder. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Mr. Qin, what are you thinking?” Su Qian asked with a smile.

Qin Yu did not hide anything. He said in a deep voice, “Qing City is called the Cursed City because of that mystic realm?”

Su Qian heard this and could not help but shake her head, “You’re wrong.

“Do you know why the mystic realm is the most well-preserved cultivation resource? It’s because the location of the mystic realm does not produce any special phenomena.

“It’s also because of this that the mystic realm is rarely explored.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu said with some confusion, “Then how did you all discover it? And how did Jingdu Martial Arts Association discover it?”

Su Qian pursed her lips and said, “I’m not sure either. After all, I’m just a worker.”

Seeing this, Qin Yu didn’t say anything else.

He followed Su Qian to get a car and left the airport.

The car sped all the way and finally arrived at an ancient street.

This street was quite similar to snack street. There were restaurants, teahouses, and all kinds of snacks on both sides.

Su Qian brought Qin Yu to a small teahouse and sat down. Then, she ordered a pot of tea.

Qin Yu looked at the surrounding environment and said, “Teahouses... it’s indeed rare to see.”

Su Qian smiled and said, “How is it? Isn’t this place a little out of place with other places?”

Qin Yu nodded silently.

There were very few tall buildings in the entire Qing City.

In the 21st century, this was a rare sight.

“Wait a moment. Someone will come to pick us up later,” Su Qian said.

Qin Yu picked up the teacup and took a sip, and a trace of surprise flashed in his eyes.

“There’s... a trace of spiritual energy in this tea?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but widen his eyes.

He quickly picked up the teacup and poured the tea into his mouth again.

As expected! There was indeed a trace of spiritual energy in this tea. Although it wasn’t dense, he could clearly feel it!

“Su Qian, where did this tea leaf come from?” Qin Yu frowned and asked.

Su Qian said, “I’m not sure either. What’s wrong?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Nothing.”

This made Qin Yu even more interested in this so-called mystic realm.

Even the small teahouse on the street had spiritual energy. What was this mystic realm? And what kind of treasure did it have?

“Let’s go somewhere else to have a look,” Qin Yu stood up and said.

Then, he turned around and walked out of the teahouse, wandering around the small street.

Along the way, Qin Yu became more and more surprised!

All the snacks on this small street had a trace of extremely weak spiritual energy!

“It seems that it’s not the tea leaves, but the street.” Qin Yu frowned.

He looked at Su Qian and said, “Do you feel that regardless of the food or the drinks here, they are all a bit strange?”

Su Qian lowered her head and ate a mouthful of candied haw. She shook her head and said, “No...”

“Really?” Qin Yu said in surprise.

“Really! How could I lie to you?” Su Qian said helplessly.

“That’s indeed strange,” Qin Yu frowned.

Su Qian was a Martial Marquis!

With the acuity of the Martial Marquis, she would definitely discover the spiritual energy contained herein!

Could it be that... something was strange about this spiritual energy? Qin Yu thought to himself.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu released his internal qi. In an instant, almost every pore felt the surrounding spiritual energy.

He tried to use his body to absorb the spiritual energy here, but the flow of this spiritual energy was extremely slow.

“Hmm?”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly discovered something!

He could feel the density of the spiritual energy. And through the density of the spiritual energy, a channel of spiritual energy that looked like a ‘path’ appeared in Qin Yu’s heart!

In other words, through his perception of the spiritual energy, Qin Yu could clearly see the density of the spiritual energy around him.

The density of the spiritual energy was like a road sign, and more like a path!

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said in a low voice, “Is this the phenomenon of the mystic realm?”

As long as it was different from the surroundings, there would be a phenomenon! The mystic realm was no exception!

And the reason why Su Qian said that the mystic realm would not produce any phenomenon was probably that they did not have this ability!

“According to the direction of this spiritual energy, the place in front is the densest. That mystic realm might be there,” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said in a low voice.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu lifted his foot and walked in that direction.

He couldn’t wait to prove his method.

At this moment, a figure suddenly shot out from the second floor by the side and blocked Qin Yu’s way!

This person was eight feet tall and had a strong build. There was an unspeakable malevolence on his face.

A strong killing intent burst out from his body, and this killing intent directly blocked the connection between Qin Yu and the internal qi of the mystic realm.

“Who are you?” This angered Qin Yu and he couldn’t help but look at this person with a sullen face.

This person crossed his arms over his chest and said coldly, “You must be Qin Yu. I’ve heard of you for a long time.”

“Heard of me for what? Are you sick?” Qin Yu said impatiently.

“Get lost quickly. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being rude!”

The man sneered, “Many people boasted that you are the number one person of the younger generation. I, Hu Feng, of Qing City, not convinced!”

“Hu Feng? The son of the Sect Master Hu?” It seemed that someone had heard of this name.

“Hu Feng?” Su Qian frowned slightly at the side.

Qin Yu glanced at her and said, “You know him?”

Su Qian said, “I don’t know him, but I have heard of Sect Master Hu. It was said that Qing City declined because Sect Master Hu had stolen the fortunes of Qing City.”
