1890 The Great Cultivator’s Sanctum

The entire earth was rumbling, and the entire Peaceful Land City seemed to be shaking at this moment.

Qin Yu frowned. He quickly got up and looked into the distance with his desolate divine eye.

He could see faint light lit up in the distance, but the light was not bright. Even with the help of the desolate divine eye, he could only see a tiny bit.

The strange phenomenon lasted for about half an hour. The people in Peaceful Land City seemed to be used to it and did not seem to have any abnormal reactions.

“Rumble…”

At this moment, a war chariot passed by in the sky and dashed into the distance. Its destination seemed to be the source of the strange phenomenon.

“What’s going on?” Chang Mang grabbed his wine cup and couldn’t help but frown.

Qin Yu shook his head, indicating that he had no idea.

He looked at the people beside him and asked, “What’s the cause of this strange phenomenon?”

Hearing this, the people around were instantly excited.

They chimed in, each of them telling their own stories.

“I heard an Immortal Emperor is having closed-door cultivation there and is about to come out!

“Nonsense! I heard from my family’s patriarch that the strange phenomenon had originated from the changes in the world. It was the doing of the heavens!”

“Yes! Yes! Yes! Rumor has it that Peaceful Land City has offended the heavens, and it’s going to punish us!”

“Don’t talk nonsense. Obviously, a peerless divine weapon is about to surface! Rumor has it that the divine weapon descended from the sky and was born from the Path of Heaven!”

Hearing their words, Qin Yu’s face darkened.

It seemed that this group of people didn’t know anything. The more they talked, the more absurd it became.

“This bunch of people are full of nonsense,” Chang Mang couldn’t help but whisper.

“Ha! It’s just an after-meal topic. It’s just nonsense.” Someone overheard Chang Mang’s words, but he wasn’t angry. Instead, he smiled and explained.

“How long has this strange phenomenon been going on?” Qin Yu nodded slightly and said.

“It’s been almost two months. What does this have to do with us, the rogue cultivators? That’s why we’re just talking nonsense,” the man shook his head and said.

This group of people was quite open-minded. They didn’t care if it was a natural disaster or a treasure that was about to appear.

It was because these people knew that even if they fought with their might, the only outcome would be losing their lives. Nothing could be changed.

“In that case, the saintess of the Gu family also came here because of this strange phenomenon?” Qin Yu asked.

“Most likely. On the surface, they said that they are here to inspect. Inspect my a*s. To the Gu family, Peaceful Land City is nothing,” the group of people shook their heads and said.

Qin Yu nodded slightly. He sat at the table and fell into deep thought.

“We don’t leave for now.” A moment later, Qin Yu looked at Chang Mang.

“You’re also interested in this?” Chang Mang blinked his eyes and asked.

“Mmm.” Qin Yu did not hide his intention.

To the rogue cultivators, taking an enormous risk was the only way to change their destiny.

Chang Mang was not a timid person. He grinned and said, “I think so too. Since the Gu family has sent people here, it must be something extraordinary.”

Upon hearing Chang Mang’s words, someone beside him laughed and said, “Who doesn’t want treasures? We also want them, but do you want to compete with the aristocratic families? It’s impossible.”

Chang Mang snorted and said, “It’s not important whether we can get the treasure or not. What’s important is seeing them unhappy makes me happy. There’s nothing more important than making me happy in this world!”

The surrounding people couldn’t help but burst into laughter when they heard this. Even Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh.

Chang Mang’s words did make sense. If one did not even have the spirit to resist, then the entire world would truly be a pool of stagnant water, and nothing could ever change it.

Immediately after, Qin Yu and Chang Mang planned to get up and find a place to stay temporarily.

At this moment, an internal qi suddenly swept across the sky. This internal qi was incredibly peaceful, making people feel like approaching it.

Looking up, they saw a woman floating over in the void. Her delicate feet stepped on a cloud-like magical artifact, making her look even more like a fairy.

The most important thing was the internal qi on her body. That internal qi did not make people feel disgusted at all. Instead, it made people feel like getting closer to her.

“It’s the Gu family’s saintess. Look, she’s really here!” someone exclaimed.

The crowd below shouted repeatedly. For a moment, everyone ran to the window, looked at the saintess, and sniffed hard. It was as if smelling her body was a great blessing.

Even though the saintess was only passing by, she still caused a commotion.

Qin Yu looked at the beautiful figure in the distance, and he couldn’t help but sway emotionally.

It was not that Qin Yu was fickle, but the internal qi on her body was hard to resist. It was unknown what kind of technique she had cultivated.

“So that’s the Gu family’s saintess. She’s quite pretty,” Chang Mang muttered.

“Tie her up and send her to your house to be your wife,” Qin Yu said jokingly.

“Go to hell.” A hint of shyness flashed across Chang Mang’s rough face.

“Hahaha!” Qin Yu laughed out loud. He then brought Chang Mang out of the tavern, planning to stay there for the night.

Along the way, Qin Yu was silent and absent-minded.

“What are you thinking about?” Chang Mang asked.

“Since the Gu family has sent people here, why aren’t other families making any moves?” Qin Yu asked in a deep voice.

Chang Mang was startled. He then scratched his head. “You’re right. If there’s any supreme treasure, how could the aristocratic families miss it?”

“Don’t tell me they haven’t received the news?” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“It’s also possible that they’re already here but just temporarily hiding.” Chang Mang guessed.

...

Qin Yu nodded. It was very likely.

To these aristocratic families, even if a treasure appeared in the depths of the universe, soon they would appear in the vicinity like a sharp-nosed dog, let alone Peaceful Land City.

“Since the Gu family has sent their saintess, most probably Yan Ruoxue will be here as well,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu suddenly felt a little excited.

But on second thought, if Yan Ruoxue really came, Si Shiyue might also come.

Soon, Qin Yu and Chang Mang found a place to stay temporarily.

In the following few days.

From time to time, there would be a strange phenomenon in Peaceful Land City, and visions would appear in the sky.

“Could it be that some treasure is really surfacing?” Qin Yu was getting more surprised.

Three days later, there was news from Peaceful Land City.

In the suburbs 800 stars away from Peaceful Land City, a sanctum appeared.

...

As soon as the news was out, many people immediately rushed to the sanctum.

“Sanctum? What sanctum?” Qin Yu frowned. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“It’s so eye-catching, and there’s such a strange phenomenon and vision. I’m afraid it’s a sanctum of a great cultivator at the Tribulation Stage,” said Chang Mang in a deep voice.

“Tribulation Stage…” Qin Yu murmured in a low voice.

That was truly unreachable because it was the most powerful existence cultivated under the Path of Heaven!
