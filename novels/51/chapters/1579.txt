He Teng’s shadow floated up from his body.

He seemed to have expected this, so he was not too surprised. He only looked at the deputy sect master in front of him.

“Two armies fighting without killing their envoys, don’t you understand this principle...”he teng looked at the deputy sect master and said gloomily.

The deputy sect master said with a dark face, “You are the sect master of Teng Sect?”

He Teng ignored this sentence and said indifferently, “I originally couldn’t find an excuse to attack you. Now it’s fine. You Kill My Teng Sect’s people first. I...”

“F * ck you!”

Before he teng could finish his words, Qin Yu cursed loudly.

Hearing this familiar voice, he teng was obviously stunned.

He immediately turned to look in Qin Yu’s direction and said in surprise, “Qin Yu? Why are you here?”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Why? Are you surprised to see me?”

He Teng narrowed his eyes slightly and said with a faint smile, “Qin Yu, we haven’t seen each other for a long time...”

“Don’t talk nonsense.”Qin Yu waved his hand and said.

“You F * cking snatched the white bone club. Are you powerful now? I killed him and it has nothing to do with the Tianyun sect. If you want to take revenge, come and find me,”Qin Yu sneered and said.

He Teng narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “You killed him?”

“That’s right. This kid really deserves to die for shouting at me. I helped you to teach him a lesson. You Won’t blame me, right?”Qin Yu sneered.

He Teng said with a dark face, “Kid, you and I are both from Earth. Originally, you and I should take care of each other and support each other, but you’ve ruined my good deeds many times!”

Qin Yu sneered, “Take care of each other with you? If you hadn’t shown up at the last moment, do you think you would have the chance to come to the Holy Region?”

“Hahahaha! I’m afraid it’s not that easy to kill me,”he teng said with some pride.

Then, he teng said with a slightly threatening tone, “Qin Yu, I don’t want to kill you for the time being. My target is the Tianyun sect. As the saying goes, there’s a good reason for me to start. I...”

“Cut the crap. You’d better return the white bone club obediently,”Qin Yu interrupted he teng.

He Teng narrowed his eyes slightly and said indifferently, “Qin Yu, I have the white bone club. Do You Think You are my match?”

“Then you can come and try,”Qin Yu said coldly.

He teng laughed and said, “Now is not the time. Don’t worry. Your body is mine. No one can take it away!”

These words sounded a little strange, and even the many elders of the Tianyun sect had unnatural expressions on their faces.

“Sect leader he, now that the northern land has come to invade, our most important thing is to resist the northern land. We shouldn’t have a conflict at this time,”at this time, an elder of the Tianyun sect said.

He teng sneered and said, “I don’t know where you come from with so much benevolence and morality. What does the northern land’s invasion have to do with me? My Dream is the Sea of stars, not you lowly ants!”

“Enough, he teng. Don’t talk nonsense. I’ll find an opportunity to visit you,”Qin Yu said coldly.

He Teng smiled faintly and said, “Welcome. I’m looking forward to your arrival.”

After saying that, Qin Yu waved his hand and directly erased this Phantom.

“Little Friend Qin, do you know he teng?”The deputy sect master next to him asked in puzzlement.

Qin Yu said in a low voice, “I can be considered to know him, but I can also be considered an enemy. In short, I can’t explain it clearly in just a few words.”

“Young friend Qin, if that’s the case, is there a possibility that you will be the one to mediate? The current Heavenly Cloud sect can’t afford a great battle anymore,”an elder said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu laughed bitterly and said, “That’s absolutely impossible. You guys don’t understand he teng too well. This person... it’s hard to explain in a few words.”

“Sigh, now that the sect master isn’t around and the entire heavenly cloud sect has suffered great losses, if Teng sect were to attack at this time, I’m afraid that the Heavenly Cloud Sect...”

The elder didn’t continue speaking, but the meaning was very obvious.

Qin Yu was also a bit worried.

One had to know that he teng this kid was pure evil. His evil had no bottom line.

A person without a bottom line was extremely terrifying.

“How about this, I’ll stay here for a few days.”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“If he teng really dares to come, I’ll definitely make a move.”

“And you guys take this time to inquire about the sect leader.”

The deputy sect leader sighed slightly and said, “This is the only thing we can do now.”

...

On the other side.

He Teng slowly opened his eyes.

His pupils were extremely strange now. The whites of his eyes could no longer be seen, and his entire person appeared extremely gloomy.

“This Qin Yu...”He Teng’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he muttered Qin Yu’s name in a low voice.

“Is it that Qin Yu again?”At this moment, he Teng’s confidant walked over.

He Teng nodded slightly and said with a faint smile, “Speaking of which, it really is a bad karma. He came to the South Province, and I also came to the South Province...”

“Sect leader, you have the white bone club. Just kill him directly!”The confidant muttered.

He Teng shook his head and said in a deep voice, “Qin Yu also has a trump card. I don’t want to confront him directly for the time being...” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“What about the Heavenly Cloud Sect?”

“Let’s put it on hold for the time being,”he teng said indifferently.

“I don’t believe that Qin Yu will always stay in the heavenly cloud sect.”

An extremely strange situation had formed.

The two godly monarchs of the heavenly cloud sect did not dare to make a move against Qin Yu because they were afraid of the Heavenly Cloud sect.

And he teng did not dare to make a move against the Heavenly Cloud sect because he was afraid of Qin Yu.

In a short period of time, this seemed to have reached a balance, and this balance would be broken the moment Qin Yu left the Tianyun sect.

In the next few days, Qin Yu stayed in the Tianyun sect. He absorbed the great Yue fruit in his body and slowly comprehended the Great Dao of Heaven and earth.

On this evening, Di Zun rushed into the meeting hall in a hurry.

In the meeting hall, the deputy sect master and the elders were all present. When they saw Di Zun who had barged in, they said with some doubt, “Di Zun, what’s Wrong?”

Di Zun took a glance and said, “I’ve found the news of Lord Jue Wu!”

“En? where is she?”The deputy sect master hurriedly asked.

“She’s on wind bamboo mountain! She’s at Qu Zhu’s place!”Di Zun said while panting heavily.

After saying this, Di Zun turned around and was about to leave, intending to tell this news to Qin Yu.

“Di Zun, wait a moment.”

At this moment, an elder called out to Di Zun.

Di zun frowned and asked, “What is it?”

The elder looked at the deputy sect master and said in a deep voice, “Deputy sect master, if Qin Yu knew about this news, he would immediately rush to Qu bamboo mountain to look for Jue Wu.”

“That’s right, so?”The deputy sect master nodded and said.

The elder continued, “If he leaves, what will happen if Teng men comes to attack?”

The entire meeting hall fell silent.

“What... What do you mean? !”Di Zun widened his eyes. His expression was complicated. There was shock and anger on his face.

The elder glanced at di zun and said, “Jue Wu is on wind bamboo mountain. It should be safe for the time being. There isn’t much difference between going early and going late, but it’s different for us.”
