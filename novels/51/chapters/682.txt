Chapter 683: The Terrified Man with the Mustache! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The mask flickered with light as it flew into the coffin!

In an instant, the coffin emitted waves of internal qi that gathered on the mask!

The sinister energy instantly engulfed the entire scene!

Qin Yu, afraid that she would be affected, hurriedly pulled Xiao Yu to the side.

The mask trembled continuously in the air, and the internal qi swept up along the coffin.

Qin Yu raised his head to look at this scene, and a trace of shock flashed across his face!

What kind of method was this? Could it be that the mask had developed a sense of self?

After a moment, the scene finally quieted down.

The mask fell into the coffin, and everything returned to peace.

Qin Yu pulled Xiao Yu to the front of the coffin. He reached out his hand and took out the mask before giving it back to Xiao Yu.

“Do you have any strange feelings?” Qin Yu asked with concern.

Xiao Yu just shook her head and didn’t say anything.

Perhaps it was because of Mr. Wu’s death or because of the mask, Xiao Yu seemed to have become much quieter.

The ice-cold internal qi on her body was no longer like that of a teenage girl.

Qin Yu didn’t know whether this was a good thing or a bad thing. However, if there was really a relationship between Xiao Yu and the masked woman, then Xiao Yu’s future would be unimaginable. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

In the next few days, Qin Yu didn’t leave this place.

With Mr. Wu dead, Xiao Yu definitely wouldn’t be able to live on by herself.

After thinking about it, Qin Yu could only sigh.

“I’ll bring her back to Green Moon Villa for now,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

In the blink of an eye, a week had passed.

And Xiao Yu’s mood seemed to have eased up a lot.

Therefore, Qin Yu decided to find the man with the mustache the next day and use it to resurrect the two male corpses.

At night, Qin Yu took out the two male corpses from the Spatial Magic Artifact.

“Xiao Yu, do you know these two people?” Qin Yu pointed at the two corpses and asked.

Xiao Yu shook her head and said, “No.”

Qin Yu didn’t ask any more questions. After all, it was still uncertain whether there was a relationship between Xiao Yu and the masked woman.

“Maybe it’s just because of my constitution,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

After all, Xiao Yu had a pure dark energy body. Perhaps she could have a certain reaction with the masked woman.

“The news about the mask has already spread. Next... I’m afraid there will be endless trouble.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

This time, the people who came to snatch the mask were three Martial Marquises. What kind of powerful people would come next time?

The next day, Qin Yu brought Xiao Yu and left Chuzhou before rushing towards the man with the mustache’s location.

Along the way, Xiao Yu appeared to be quite silent.

After an unknown amount of time, Qin Yu finally found the location of the man with the mustache.

This was a desolate and uninhabited area. One could feel a trace of solemnity in the surroundings.

Qin Yu sniffed his nose and couldn’t help but frown slightly.

“It seems that a formation has been set up here,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

He tried to mobilize the internal qi in his body, but found that the internal qi in his body seemed to be suppressed, like a block of ice that couldn’t be circulated.

“There really is a formation,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Of course, he didn’t think too much about it. Even if there was no surge of internal qi, Qin Yu’s body could be said to be unparalleled.

Qin Yu brought Xiao Yu and walked forward.

Soon, an array platform appeared in Qin Yu’s eyes.

As he looked at it, this array platform appeared to be quite ancient.

On it, many strange characters were carved. Around the array platform, there were many array flags.

“It should be here,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

This mysterious array platform was simple and unadorned, and there wasn’t even a hint of internal qi surging on it.

The formation stage was also built very simply, as if it was going to break at any moment.

“Where is this?” Seeing this, Xiao Yu couldn’t help but frown and ask.

Qin Yu didn’t answer this question, but said, “Xiao Yu, I will borrow your mask later. I will return it to you very soon.”

Xiao Yu passed the mask to Qin Yu.

“This mask isn’t safe with me. I will let you take care of it for the time being,” Xiao Yu said.

Qin Yu thought for a moment. It seemed reasonable, so he nodded and agreed.

Then, Qin Yu looked around and couldn’t help but mutter, “Where did the man with the mustache go? Could he have already left?”

“Who’s the man with the mustache?” Asked Xiao Yu.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “He’s a friend of mine. Let’s wait for him here.”

After saying that, Qin Yu pulled Xiao Yu and sat on the platform while waiting for the man with the mustache.

Time passed by minute by minute, but the man with the mustache never showed up.

Soon, night fell.

There was no light in the surroundings except for the starlight.

At this moment, a figure was hiding in the darkness.

He looked in Qin Yu’s direction, and coldness flashed in his eyes.

“Although I admire you very much, for that mask’s sake... I can only let you down!” The man with the mustache said in a low voice.

Then, he restrained his breath and strode in the direction of Qin Yu.

At this moment, Qin Yu was completely oblivious to his surroundings. He was meditating and cultivating on this array platform.

Very soon, the mustached man’s figure appeared behind Qin Yu.

He looked coldly at Qin Yu, and a conflicted look flashed in his eyes.

But this conflicted look disappeared in a flash, and was replaced by coldness!

He raised his palm and slowly extended it in Qin Yu’s direction!

At this moment, Xiao Yu suddenly turned his head and looked at the man with the mustache.

The man with the mustache frowned slightly. Just as he was about to make a ruthless move, his expression suddenly changed drastically!

As he looked at Xiao Yu, the man with the mustache’s face turned extremely pale!

In the next second, the man with the mustache shot backward! There was even a trace of fear on his face!

“You... you...” the man with the mustache pointed in the direction of Xiao Yu and kept muttering, as if he had seen a ghost!

His movements naturally attracted Qin Yu’s attention.

He turned around and looked at the man with the mustache. He frowned and said, “What are you doing? Have you seen a ghost?”

The man with the mustache swallowed hard. Sweat kept breaking out on his forehead!

In just an instant, countless thoughts flashed through the man with the mustache’s mind!

His plan of snatching the mask vanished into thin air at this moment!

Qin Yu looked at the man with the mustache suspiciously, then at Xiao Yu, and muttered, “What are you doing?”

The man with the mustache wiped the sweat off his forehead and stood up with an embarrassed smile.

“Nothing, nothing...” the man with the mustache put on his carefree expression again.

Qin Yu looked at the man with the mustache up and down, then at Xiao Yu. Then, he said with some amusement, “You seem to be very afraid of Xiao Yu.”

When he heard this, the man with the mustache’s heart thumped! His expression also became extremely shifty!
