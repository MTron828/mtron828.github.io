Chapter 64: Harum-scarum Lin Wan Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu naturally understood Yan Ruoxue’s good intentions.

Wei Jiang, who wasn’t far away, seemed a little troubled. He didn’t want Qin Yu to help, but Yan Ruoxue’s words gave him no way out.

At this moment, whether he was willing or not, he had to agree.

“Then I can only trouble Mr. Qin,” Wei Jiang was forced to say with a smile.

Qin Yu was also quite helpless. Although his medical skills were superb, not many people recognized him, so Wei Jiang couldn’t be blamed for this.

After the banquet, Yan Ruoxue sent Qin Yu to Dragon Paradise.

The car stopped at the entrance, but the two of them weren’t in a hurry to get out.

At this time, Yan Ruoxue suddenly looked at Qin Yu and asked, “Qin Yu, if one day, I return to Jingdu, can you take care of yourself?”

Hearing this, Qin Yu froze. He hurriedly asked, “Miss Yan, are you returning to Jingdu?”

Yan Ruoxue shook her head and said, “Not yet, but there will be a day when I return.”

Qin Yu opened his mouth, but he didn’t know what to say.

Yes, Yan Ruoxue had to return to Jingdu sooner or later. That was her home.

But with Qin Yu’s current ability, going to Jingdu was equivalent to forcing himself into a dead end.

Yan Ruoxue was a wealthy heiress. Even in Jingdu, she was a prominent figure. There were probably countless people chasing after her.

With Qin Yu’s current abilities, Yan Ruoxue was way out of his league.

“If you return to Jingdu, I will try to go to Jingdu to see you and propose marriage as soon as possible,” Qin Yu took a deep breath and replied seriously.

Hearing Qin Yu’s reply, Yan Ruoxue blinked her eyes and said, “With this promise, I’m satisfied.”

After Yan Ruoxue let Qin Yu off, she returned to the Yan family’s manor.

The next day, Yan Ruoxue was going out to participate in an event downtown.

Not long after she went out, her car was stopped by a few people.

“Miss Yan, there are two cars blocking our way,” the driver frowned and said.

Yan Ruoxue looked up and couldn’t help but feel a little astonished.

There was someone in Jiangcheng who dared to block her car?

“Miss Yan, please wait a moment. I’ll go down and take a look,” the secretary said.

“No need.” Yan Ruoxue shook her head.

She opened the car door and got out of the car.

After Yan Ruoxue got out of the car, seven to eight people jumped out of the cars blocking the road in front. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The leader was a young man with gold-rimmed glasses, and the one following him was actually Lin Wan!

When she saw Lin Wan, Yan Ruoxue’s expression couldn’t help but turn cold.

“B * tch, I’ve been waiting for you for a long time!” Lin Wan angrily ran in front of Yan Ruoxue.

“Jiang Tao, he’s the one who hit me!” Lin Wan said angrily.

The young man called Jiang Tao walked over with a smile. When he saw Yan Ruoxue’s face clearly, he couldn’t help but gasp!

This woman was too beautiful! It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that no one in the nation rivaled her beauty! He had never even seen such a beautiful woman in beauty contests!

“Jiang Tao, hurry up and teach him a lesson!” Lin Wan urged from the side.

Jiang Tao smiled. He walked in front of Yan Ruoxue and said nonchalantly, “Miss, seeing how beautiful you are, I really can’t bear to do it.”

“How about you apologize to Lin Wan and let this matter pass?” said Jiang Tao.

Yan Ruoxue looked at Jiang Tao coldly and said, “Get lost.”

Jiang Tao froze, and a hint of displeasure appeared on his face.

“Although I’m merciful towards women, it doesn’t mean that I don’t have a temper,” said Jiang Tao coldly.

Lin Wan, who was at the side, cursed, “Weren’t you very cocky yesterday? Didn’t you slap me yesterday? Show me your arrogance again today!”

“Okay.” Yan Ruoxue raised her hand and slapped Lin Wan again!

Lin Wan froze, and then she shouted crazily, “You’re dead meat. I’m going to kill you, you b * tch!”

Jiang Tao, who was at the side, also said with a cold expression, “Since you refuse to back down for my sake, don’t blame me for being rude!”

“Wait.”

At this moment, the secretary suddenly got out of the car.

He walked all the way to Jiang Tao and said with a smile, “May I ask if your name is Jiang Tao?”

Jiang Tao froze and frowned, “You know me?”

The secretary continued, “The son of Deputy Mayor Jiang?”

Hearing that, Jiang Tao immediately said with some pride, “That’s right! Since you know who I am, then hurry up and admit your mistake!”

The secretary pushed up his glasses and sneered while saying, “Even your father wouldn’t dare to say that.”

“You’re bluffing. Who do you think you are?” Jiang Tao couldn’t help but burst into laughter!

“If your father still wants his job, you’d better ask him to come over and apologize,” Yan Ruoxue said coldly.

“Ask my father to apologize? You’re too big for your britches!” Jiang Tao said angrily.

“No one in Jiangcheng dares to boast about something so over the top!”

Seeing this, the secretary stopped talking.

He took out his cell phone and dialed a number.

After the call was connected, Deputy Mayor Jiang said politely, “Why isn’t Miss Yan here yet? We have been waiting for her for a long time!”

The secretary sneered and said, “Mr. Jiang, I’m afraid Miss Yan can’t go today. Your son blocked the road and threatened to beat Miss Yan.”

“Mr. Jiang, let me remind you that you’d better handle it properly.”

After saying that, the secretary hung up the phone.

“You’re so pretentious.” Jiang Tao wasn’t intimidated.

“Do you really think you’re some big shot?” Jiang Tao sneered.

Lin Wan, who was next to him, cursed, “That’s right. What Miss Yan? Do you think we’re afraid of you because you’re from Jingdu?”

“That’s right, what do you think... ?” Before Jiang Tao could finish his sentence, he suddenly reacted.

“You... Who did you say she was?” Jiang Tao grabbed Lin Wan’s arm and said anxiously.

“Miss Yan from Jingdu, what’s wrong... ?” Lin Wan asked, somewhat puzzled.

Hearing this, Jiang Tao felt even more apprehensive and remorseful!

He gritted his teeth and slapped Lin Wan!

“You screwed me over!” Jiang Tao roared angrily.

After saying that, Jiang Tao hurriedly looked at Yan Ruoxue and said with a trembling voice, “Miss... Miss Yan, I didn’t know it was you. Sorry for offending you. I hope you can forgive me...”

Yan Ruoxue glanced at Lin Wan coldly and didn’t say anything.

“Let’s go home.” Then, Yan Ruoxue went straight back to the car.

Jiang Tao was on edge. Jiangcheng City dedicated a lot of manpower and resources to convince Yan Ruoxue to attend this meeting.

But now, because of him, the meeting was canceled!

“I’m dead meat...” Jiang Tao’s expression was extremely ugly.

At this moment, Jiang Tao’s phone rang.

He picked up the phone and saw that it was his father calling.

Jiang Tao picked up the phone with a trembling voice and quivering lips, “Dad... Dad, what’s wrong?”

“What’s wrong? Are you trying to dig your own grave? Hurry up and get back here!” Deputy Mayor Jiang cursed on the other end.
