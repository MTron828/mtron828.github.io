Chapter 2546 Fate Can Be Changed

“What if one day, you become a complete lunatic like the eight seniors of the Three Purities Sect?”

Qin Yu pondered for a long time before voicing out his true thoughts.

“Good! The beginning of things is uncertain, but fate can change! Cultivators of our generation should have this spirit. If we can reach that extreme by taking the conventional path, then the world will not change.”

Xuan Xin roared. He stepped to Qin Yu’s side and patted his shoulder. The massive force almost made Qin Yu fall.

“My friend Xuan Xin, please be gentle.”

Qin Yu grimaced in pain and heaved a sigh of relief.

Seeing Xuan Xin’s actions, he should also be expressing his attitude.

He suddenly felt a bit more favorably toward these three sects.

Compared to the aristocratic family of the Holy Region, the six people of these three sects were as pure as immortals.

After a short rest, Xuan Tian’s expression suddenly changed.

“Saint Zi Yang’s tablet has sensed something again. It’s not far from us! Shen Qian, bring Qin Yu along. The rest of you follow closely behind Xuan Xin.”

Xuan Tian’s expression changed, and a tablet appeared in his palm.

The tablet was flickering at this point and emitting a strange light from Xuan Tian’s palm.

“Senior Juan Liu! Senior Juan Liu!”

At this moment, Qin Yu did not need to worry. Moreover, with Xuan Xin and the others ‘strength, they should be able to guarantee their safety.

Qin Yu kept calling out to the artifact spirit of the Heart of the Ocean with his soul, but there was no response.

Even if Qin Yu increased the power of the soul, there was still no response.

“Strange, how did Senior Juan Liu come out previously?”

Qin Yu carefully recalled the situation when Senior Juan Liu had appeared previously. His compatibility with this magical artifact was not enough.

The compatibility between the cultivator and the magical artifact would only deepen after years of continuous refinement before they could communicate with the artifact spirit. Qin Yu’s refinement of the Heart of the Ocean had not reached that level, so he could not initiate to call for the artifact spirit.

Qin Yu pondered for a long time. He guessed only Flame Demon’s internal qi could trigger the artifact spirit, Juan Liu, to appear.

After a while, the Heart of the Ocean suddenly emanated intense fluctuations.

The Heart of the Ocean transformed into the figure of a goddess, and she felt the crown that was still warm in disbelief.

Wherever Flame Demon went, the water creatures had no way to survive.

To her, Flame Demon was the source of the ultimate evil to their water element.

During the long years, the Heart of the Ocean had changed many masters, but she had gradually given up on killing Flame Demon.

Once, the ancestor of the Gu family used the source of poison to attack Flame Demon.

However, it was still unable to harm its core. She had only casually mentioned the agreement with Qin Yu, and she had never thought this youth could really fulfill her long-cherished wish.

“Youngster, come forward.”

An ethereal voice transmitted into Qin Yu’s divine sense figurine.

Qin Yu gently moved forward, and Juan Liu gently hugged him in her arms. A sacred internal qi surrounded him.

Under such internal qi, no one could have any profane thoughts.

A source of life energy injected into his soul, infusing into every cell of his body.

The dense elemental energy instantly inflated his body like a balloon.

The internal injuries he had previously were all healed under the surging of this life source.

This extreme source of life completely healed the injuries of his holy body.

After the Glazed Holy Body’s spine absorbed enough energy, it spread throughout the skeleton and slowly into his flesh and blood.

Qin Yu focused his attention and absorbed this enormous energy. At this moment, a trace of internal qi of the source of life emitted from his pores.

Several people in the surroundings took a deep breath. They could even feel the power of life with every breath.

“Looks like my friend Qin Yu has gained something.”

Xuan Xin chuckled, but they did not show a trace of jealousy.

“This kid is really fortunate.”

Zhang Xiang leaned over and took a deep breath everywhere as if he wanted to inhale more life force into his body.

An extremely comfortable feeling enveloped Qin Yu’s soul, and the corners of his mouth revealed a baby-like smile.

In his soul, countless silver-gray blood scabs were expelled from the origin of his soul, causing a tremendous foul stench.

“Child, absorb it in peace. This is the power of the source I have received over the years. However, the path that you cultivate has a curse that transcends life. Therefore, even though some of your life force has recovered, your life thread is still narrow and short. You will have to resolve this yourself. As for the source of poison, I even need to collaborate to absorb it. When I helped Gu Ning condense it previously, I kept a small bottle. If your Way of Water can reach the power of the origin, and if you work with me, you can condense ten drops of the source of poison every hundred years.”

The artifact spirit’s voice sounded a little tired. After leaving behind a few words, she transformed into the Heart of the Ocean and entered Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

The celestial aura of the source of life drifted within Qin Yu’s body. This terrifying energy did not pose any danger to Qin Yu. It was like a gentle breeze that only brought comfort and peace.

Qin Yu also did not expect the artifact spirit, Juan Liu, to repay a verbal agreement so wholeheartedly.

Even a single drop of this source of life was priceless, let alone giving it to him with all her might.

Not to mention a small bottle of the source of poison. This was something that even Saint was afraid of.

The artifact spirit of the celestial artifact actually had such heaven-defying power. Not only could it open up another space to hide objects, but it also had such formidable insight power. This could not help but make Qin Yu feel shocked.

Fortunately, the artifact spirit of the Heart of the Ocean was very gentle to him. Moreover, he killed Flame Demon, which probably significantly boosted Juan Liu’s impression of him.

This would be of great help to Qin Yu when he refined this supreme treasure in the future. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

At this moment, everyone had also reached the vicinity of the tablet. However, compared to other places, this place was overly quiet.

Even the terrifying storm of dark energy seemed to have completely stopped here.

“Be on guard. Something is wrong.”

Xuan Tian frowned and reminded everyone.
