2381 The Power of the Primordial Rune Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qin Yu nodded. After simulating the Five Element and Eight Trigram Technique millions of times, he seemed to have obtained a rough outline.

In an instant, tens of thousands of layers of spatial phantoms suddenly stacked up in his hand.

The moment it changed again, he saw the sea of space through the ball of spatial qi.

His hand reached out gently as if he could feel the internal qi of the sea of space.

With a thought, the ball of spatial qi turned into a spatial dagger. Qin Yu grabbed it and gently wiped it across.

A flame with the shape of the character “one” appeared in the air, and an endless void within suddenly sucked in a large amount of air.

Even when the dagger disappeared, the one-word void seemed to have lasted for a long time, and could not restore.

Within the span of three breaths, Qin Yu felt his chaotic power energy being sucked dry. The primordial rune even wanted to deplete all the energy in his bones, turning him into a husk.

Qin Yu abruptly cut off the connection and stopped the rune from evolving using his left hand.

Cold sweat dripped from his forehead. Even the Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivators might not match the energy within his Glazed Holy Body.

The energy used to simulate this rune drained nearly half of his body’s energy. If he could probe the clear primordial rune in the true sea of rules, how powerful would that be?

Previously, the limit of his strongest defensive Singularity Space was only a thousand layers of space. After evolving this primordial rune, he could control ten thousand layers of space, which was ten times bigger.

Qin Yu now had a vague understanding that he should judge the comprehension of the sea of rules based on position and depth.

For example, the nine great aristocratic families’ locations must be at the core of the sea of rules where one could see the ultimate power of rules when sailing. However, one must continuously sink into the depths for extreme pureness and the power of the origin.

This was the gap in battle power between Yan Ruoxue and Yan Tianlong. Yan Ruoxue’s comprehension of spatial power was much more profound than Yan Tianlong’s. Perhaps this was the key to the strength of the Tribulation Transcending Stage.

However, he did not have any further information. It seemed that he must find time to go to Thunder Courtyard to learn about it. Only then could he make plans for his situation.

Before he could think about it in detail, a person stepping on a spatial sword had landed in Qin Yu’s courtyard.

The spatial sword stabbed into the ground, causing the courtyard to tremble.

“Yan Tianlong, what’s the matter?”

Qin Yu was a little annoyed, and his voice sounded unhappy.

If he had caused such an enormous commotion while he was swimming in the sea of space…

“Oh? From your tone, you sounded like you have a problem with me?”

Yan Tianlong raised his eyebrows and asked with a faint smile.

“I wouldn’t dare. Why are you here so late at night?”

Qin Yu forced himself to suppress his anger. Now was not the time to fall out with him. No matter what, he was still someone with authority in the Yan family.

“This time, I came to ask you on behalf of the Yan family. Are you willing to hand over the Jee family’s treasures to my Yan family?”

Yan Tianlong said coldly.

Qin Yu’s eye expression turned cold. This kind of presumptuous demand was treating him as a powerless pawn.

“You killed the First Elder of the Ni family, so you and the Ni family have an irreconcilable grudge against each other. You also hold grudges against the Yao family and the Si family. Now that you can sit in the Holy Region and cultivate safely, it’s not because of your strength but the protection of the Yan family. If you have any thoughts, please say it out now.”

These words were a blatant threat.

Yan Tianshi did not agree to Si Liuhe’s conditions straightaway because he wanted to see if he could take the treasures of the Jee family’s ancestors.

Not to mention the rare treasures, the Xuanyuan Sword alone could be considered a supreme treasure among the celestial artifacts. This magical artifact had the terrifying power to tear apart the heavens and earth. Perhaps all the nine great aristocratic families’ celestial artifacts combined could not compare to it.

“Let’s not talk about if I did obtain the treasures of the Jee family. Even if I did, it would still belong to the ancestor of the Jee family.”

Qin Yu sneered and said. He could finally tell that the Yan family was eyeing the treasures behind him. They had no time to care about anything else.

“Then you can leave now. Otherwise, once you die, people will think that the Yan family is coveting your treasures and has attacked you.”

Yan Tianlong was no longer pretentious and directly ordered him to leave.

Qin Yu’s body floated up, intending to inform Yan Ruoxue before he left.

“Get down here. No one is allowed to fly in the territory of the Yan family.”

Seeing the scene, Yan Tianlong was furious. He suddenly slammed his hand into the air.

It seemed to have hit the surface of a drum and caused a thunderous explosion in the air.

A massive force traveled through the air and struck Qin Yu’s body directly.

However, Qin Yu could not be bothered. The qi energy entered his body and directly turned into spiritual energy that surged into his cells.

He moved his body and headed toward Mount Donghuang.

“How dare you!”

“Forget it.”

Yan Guyun’s figure was like a water wave slowly appearing around Yan Tianlong.

“Just as I said, this kid is a miser. He won’t hand over the Jee family’s ancestor’s treasures. He has Wu Ji’s treasure, Coffin of Nine Lifetimes, and the chaotic body bloodline. In my opinion, capturing him and refining memories directly, as well as extracting bloodlines, should be the top priorities. With his bloodline, our Yan family’s bloodline will improve by leaps and bounds.”

“There’s no need to say anything else. It’s up to the head of the family to arrange.”

Yan Guyun frowned slightly and ignored Yan Tianlong’s words.

Instead, his gaze focused on the spatial rift the spatial dagger created. The space was still flickering with burning flames at this moment, and the rift had not disappeared.

“Qin Yu, no matter what, I will leave with you this time.”

Yan Ruoxue’s face revealed a determined expression. She had always thought that with her cultivation, she might be able to change Yan Tianshi’s mind.

However, the various rules of the Yan family over the past few days had made her understand.

The Yan family still disagreed with her being together with Qin Yu.

“Ruoxue, trust me.”

Qin Yu gently pulled her cold little hand, unwilling to let go for a long time.

“Qin Yu, be careful when you leave this time. As far as I know, many people have gathered outside the Yan family, waiting for you to leave.”

Uncle Yan sighed and left after saying that.

Yan Guyun behind him arrived. He stepped to Qin Yu’s side as if he wanted him to leave quickly.

He pulled Yan Ruoxue along and slowly walked out of the Yan family.
