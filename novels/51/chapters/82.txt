Chapter 83: The Angry Qin Yu Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

In Jiangcheng, this night was full of chaos

After this incident happened, Uncle Wu wasn’t in the mood to eat. He said goodbye to Shen Yun and quickly left Jiangcheng.

Shen Yun also returned home resentfully.

When he got home, Shen Tian was sitting on the sofa playing games and eating snacks. He looked quite comfortable.

“Dad, what’s wrong?” Shen Tian asked casually.

Shen Yun glanced at him and whispered, “Yan Ruoxue was kidnapped. I really don’t know who did it...”

Hearing this, Shen Tian couldn’t help but laugh.

He said proudly, “Dad, you can’t imagine it, right? I did this!”

Shen Yun frowned slightly and said, “You can’t joke about this kind of thing.”

Shen Tian hurriedly explained, “I really did it! Didn’t I tell you? We have to teach her a lesson!”

Shen Yun, who was sitting on the sofa, suddenly stood up.

He stared at Shen Tian and said in a trembling voice, “It... It really was you?”

“Why would I lie? It’s absolutely true!” Shen Tian patted his chest and said.

Hearing this, Shen Yun raised his hand and slapped Shen Tian’s face!

“Are you crazy! Don’t you know who Yan Ruoxue is?!” Shen Yun, his body trembling, glared at Shen Tian.

Shen Tian covered his face and said with some anger, “Dad, you... you actually hit me? You’ve never hit me before!”

“I want to kill you!” Shen Yun gritted his teeth.

“This matter originally had a turn for the better, but you just had to cause trouble! Do you know the consequences of hurting Yan Ruoxue?!” Shen Yun said angrily.

Shen Tian didn’t care. He snorted and said, “Dad, what are you worried about? I’ve already found a scapegoat. My plan is foolproof!”

Then, Shen Tian told Shen Yun what happened.

After Shen Yun heard it, he broke out in a cold sweat.

This was called foolproof? This was simply full of loopholes!

“You are really an idiot!” Shen Yun said through gritted teeth.

He kept pacing around the room. Panic and fear overwhelmed him.

This was also the first time Shen Yun felt such fear.

However, since he was a quick-witted businessman, Shen Yun finally calmed down.

Shen Yun pointed at Shen Tian and said, “Find someone to kill Zhao Gang right now! We can’t let him implicate us!”

“Dad, Zhao Gang is very reliable. He won’t tell anyone about us,” Shen Tian muttered.

“F * ck you!” Shen Yun was so angry that he almost fainted.

“Only dead people can keep a secret. Once he betrays us, the Yan family will never let us off the hook! Even if they have no evidence!” Shen Yun said coldly.

“Do it now! Do it now! After that, you and I will return to the provincial capital overnight!” Shen Yun said coldly.

Shen Tian had no choice but to nod.

...

On the other side, Qin Yu had already arrived at the Yan family’s manor.

In the huge Yan family’s manor, there was only the secretary alone.

The moment Qin Yu entered, the secretary said angrily, “It’s all because of you! It’s because Miss Yan was worried about your safety that she sent all her bodyguards to your side! You b*stard, you’ll drag Miss Yan to her death sooner or later!”

Qin Yu was stunned. He stared blankly at the secretary and said in a trembling voice, “You... are you telling the truth?”

“Of course!” The secretary said coldly.

“Let me tell you, I have already informed my master about this matter.”

“If anything happens to Miss Yan, just wait for your death!” The secretary said coldly.

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely ugly. He never thought that Yan Ruoxue would send all her bodyguards to his side!

Most importantly, Qin Yu didn’t even notice it!

Qin Yu was filled with mixed feelings. He wished he could give himself a slap.

But now wasn’t the time to let his imagination run wild. The most important thing was to find Yan Ruoxue’s location as soon as possible and ensure her safety.

“Take me to Miss Yan’s room immediately.” Qin Yu looked at the secretary and said anxiously.

The secretary said coldly, “What do you want to do?”

“I have a way to find her! Take me to her quickly!” Qin Yu almost roared out these words.

The secretary gritted his teeth and said coldly, “Follow me.”

The two of them came all the way to Yan Ruoxue’s room.

As soon as they entered the door, Qin Yu searched around Yan Ruoxue’s bed.

“What are you doing?” The secretary frowned and asked.

“Why is there no hair?” Qin Yu asked anxiously.

The secretary sneered, “Miss Yan’s room is cleaned every day. How can there be hair?”

Qin Yu immediately panicked. He grabbed the secretary’s arm and said anxiously, “Quick, go and find a strand of Miss Yan’s hair for me immediately. Quick!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Seeing Qin Yu’s anxious look, the secretary didn’t dare to ask further.

“Wait here.” The secretary snorted.

Qin Yu kept walking around the room while sweating profusely.

Anger and guilt overcame Qin Yu and made him even more anxious.

Finally, the secretary came in with a few strands of hair.

“Qin Yu, what are you trying to do?” The secretary said with a cold expression.

Qin Yu didn’t answer the question, but asked, “Are you sure this is Miss Yan’s hair?”

“Obviously,” the secretary said impatiently.

Qin Yu nodded. He waved his hand and said, “You can go out first.”

“What on earth do you want to do?!” The secretary was getting increasingly puzzled by Qin Yu’s behavior.

“Get out!” Qin Yu immediately shouted!

The secretary gritted his teeth. Although he was angry, he didn’t lose his temper.

After the secretary went out, Qin Yu reached out and pinched a strand of hair.

He took a deep breath and bit his finger before throwing a drop of blood into the air.

At the same time, a dark red light slowly lit up on his finger.

The light quickly wrapped around the strand of hair and floated into the air to merge with the drop of blood.

This was a forbidden technique left behind by his father. It was extremely harmful to the body and might even affect his future advancement path.

However, Qin Yu couldn’t care less now. As long as he could find Yan Ruoxue, Qin Yu was willing to do anything.

The air was filled with the smell of blood. The scarlet light was like a lamp, lighting up the entire room!

“Phew!”

Qin Yu spat out a mouthful of blood. His forehead was also covered in layers of sweat.

A few minutes later, Qin Yu’s eyes suddenly opened.

The light in the room also quickly disappeared.

Everything returned to calm.

Qin Yu stood up with a murderous look in his eyes.

Then, he turned his head and walked out of the room.

At this time, the secretary was waiting outside the door. When he saw Qin Yu, the secretary asked, “Where are you going?”

Qin Yu glanced at him and said coldly, “I found Miss Yan’s location. I will bring Miss Yan back safely.”

“You found her?” The secretary was stunned.

He wanted to ask more questions, but Qin Yu had already walked out quickly and left the Yan family manor in his car.
