he said coldly, “My master told me to look after Mr. Qin. Anyone who isn’t afraid of death can come at me!”

These words really scared everyone.

Although they didn’t believe that Yao Qing was Jiang He’s disciple, they still felt a little uneasy inside.

It was because Jiang He was too famous

Even if they knew that Yao Qing was fake, they weren’t willing to take this risk.

This was the deterrence that Jiang He had in everyone’s hearts.

“Since you are Mr. Jiang’s disciple, we can spare his life,” someone said first.

“But he must hand over the Meridian Circulation Technique, or else he will be killed without mercy!”

Yao Qing was about to speak, but Qin Yu interrupted him with a wave of his hand.

He wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and said, “Do you really want the Meridian Circulation Technique?”

“What do you think?” Xiaoru snorted.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “Okay, I can give you the Meridian Circulation Technique, but I can’t carry it with me.”

“What do you mean?” Xiaoru said with a cold look.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Go to the provincial capital tomorrow, and I will give you guys the Meridian Circulation Technique.”

Hearing this, the three of them couldn’t help but look at each other.

Xiaoru said fiercely, “What if you lie to us?”

“At this moment, how could I dare to lie to you?” Qin Yu shook his head.

Xiaoru narrowed her eyes and looked at Qin Yu.

Then, she said with a cold look, “I’m telling you, if you dare to lie to me, I’ll kill your whole family and feed them to the dogs!”

Qin Yu’s expression turned slightly cold.

Xiaoru was really ruthless.

“Okay.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“I’ll wait for you at home tomorrow.”

After saying that, Qin Yu turned around and prepared to leave.

Xiaoru shouted from behind, “Qin Yu, you’d better think about it carefully, or you won’t be able to bear the consequences.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Qin Yu didn’t say anything.

He wiped the corner of his mouth and suddenly stopped in his tracks.

Then, Qin Yu turned around and said, “I heard that a Tianyuan Jade will appear in the Divine Dragon Street recently. If it really appears, please let me know.”

“Tianyuan Jade? What is that?”

“I know. Tianyuan Jade is a high-grade jade stone that can be used to refine spiritual artifacts!”

“No wonder this kid risked his life to come to Divine Dragon Street. It turns out that he is after the Tianyuan Jade!”

“Even if there is a Tianyuan Jade, it has nothing to do with you. Now, you are just a walking corpse. Stop dreaming!” Xiaoru warned in a cold voice.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything else and turned around to leave.

Taozi and Yao Qing supported Qin Yu. After they had walked far away, Yao Qing asked, “Mr. Qin, are you okay?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I’m fine.”

Yao Qing said in confusion, “Why didn’t I know there was Tianyuan Jade in the Divine Dragon Street?”

Qin Yu glanced at Yao Qing and said, “I heard it from others.”

Tianyuan Jade? It was completely made up by Qin Yu.

The reason why he said that was to avoid arousing suspicion.

“Mr. Qin, wasn’t there no Meridian Circulation Technique on the stairway to heaven? How are you going to give it to them?” Yao Qing asked in confusion.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I naturally have a countermeasure.”

During this time, Taozi didn’t say anything. Instead, she held her phone and sent a message:

“Master, Elder Qin was under siege. Someone will come to kill him tomorrow. Hurry up and save him...”
