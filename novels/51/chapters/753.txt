Chapter 754: The Worried Granny Qin Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu was unmoved by Blackie’s rage.

He looked coldly at Granny Qin and said, “Did you find someone to kill me? You want to bring him to the Mystic Realm ahead of time? You’re really shameless.”

“You’re courting death!” Blackie was completely enraged. He waved his large palm, and a black fist headed straight for Qin Yu!

Qin Yu didn’t give in, and clenched his fist to meet it.

“Boom!”

A loud sound spread throughout the Martial Arts Academy! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Both sides had the strength of their physical bodies, but the waves of air that erupted from them almost destroyed the entire courtyard!

Although the two of them were only testing each other out, they still contained extremely powerful strength.

Blackie glanced at his fist, and couldn’t help but frown slightly.

There were cracks on his black fist.

Although the injury wasn’t serious, it was shocking.

A Heaven Swallowing Python’s body was extremely strong. The outer layer of its skin could be said to be indestructible.

But now, it was at a disadvantage when fighting with a human. How could he accept this?

Granny Qin’s expression wasn’t too good.

She looked coldly at Qin Yu, her killing intent unconcealed.

“Old b*stard, I’ll come and take his life on time in three days,” Qin Yu said, pointing at Blackie.

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and left.

In the room, Granny Qin’s expression became even colder.

“Qin Yu...” Granny Qin gritted her teeth, and her skinny hands were slightly clenched.

Blackie rushed forward and said, “Granny Qin, I will not lose to him.”

Granny Qin glanced at Blackie and said, “You must not lose, not even once!”

To Granny Qin, Blackie wasn’t only her pet, but also her blood and sweat.

She even treated Blackie as her own offspring.

Therefore, Granny Qin had to make him the number one in the younger generation no matter what!

Besides that, if Blackie lost, it meant that Qin Yu could enter the Mystic Realm that imprisoned Yan Ruoxue!

That Mystic Realm was a secret of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, and Qin Yu absolutely couldn’t get his hands on it.

“I won’t lose,” Blackie clenched his fists and said in a low voice.

Granny Qin didn’t say anything.

What she wanted was a hundred percent certainty.

“I’ll think of a way to let you win,” Granny Qin said in a deep voice.

She turned around and walked out of the room, a trace of killing intent bursting out of her eyes.

On the other side, Qin Yu had officially returned to the Martial Arts Academy.

As the Martial Arts Academy’s first batch of students, they received excellent treatment and had their own independent mansions.

It was unknown whether it was intentional or not, but Qin Yu’s mansion and Yan Jinyao’s mansion happened to be next to each other.

When Qin Yu returned, he happened to meet Yan Jinyao, who was standing at the door.

He saw more than ten people standing beside Yan Jinyao.

These ten people were not old, only in their early twenties.

Judging from their internal qi, the strongest among these people was a beginner Martial Marquis.

The rest were at the half-step Martial Marquis realm.

“Qin Yu, I didn’t expect you to dare to come back,” Yan Jinyao said sarcastically.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “What? Are your followers so young now?”

Yan Jinyao glanced at the people around him and then said indifferently, “These people are my followers and also my disciples.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel like laughing.

“What? Are you planning to be independent of the Yan Family?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and asked.

Yan Jinyao wasn’t anxious. Instead, he said indifferently, “If you, Qin Yu, can establish your own sect, I, Yan Jinyao, can do the same.”

“These people are all extremely talented. Compared to the trash of your Green Moon Villa, there’s no telling how much stronger they are.” Yan Jinyao’s tone was slightly smug.

“That’s right. Our master’s requirements for taking in disciples are very high. Not everyone can become a disciple,” a youth beside Yan Jinyao said coldly

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered with Yan Jinyao. He turned around and returned to his own residence.

Yan Jinyao looked at Qin Yu’s back as he left. His gaze unconsciously fell on Xiao Yu.

“Who is that girl? Why haven’t I seen her before?” Yan Jinyao frowned and asked.

“Master, I’ll go and scout for information for you,” a disciple beside him hurriedly said.

Yan Jinyao shook his head and said, “No need. If I want to know, I can ask her myself.”

“Moreover, as long as I want to get someone, I can poach them from his side at any time.”

This was Yan Jinyao’s confidence.

As the son of the Yan family, regardless of background, looks, and resources, he was far above Qin Yu.

Therefore, Yan Jinyao believed that his charm was far from what Qin Yu could compare to.

...

In the mansion.

Qin Yu appeared to be bored to death.

There were only three days left before he had to fight with Blackie. He couldn’t do much in these short three days, so Qin Yu chose to rest.

Night fell.

However, Qin Yu couldn’t sleep at night.

He sat in the courtyard, drinking tea by himself. He was quite relaxed.

At this moment, someone had already set their eyes on Qin Yu.

In a forest near the Martial Arts Academy, Granny Qin and a young girl were standing there.

“No matter what, we have to think of a way to lure Qin Yu out,” Granny Qin said coldly.

The young girl in front of her said with some confusion, “Granny Qin, with your ability, why do you need my help? You can just kill your way in...”

Granny Qin glanced at her coldly and said, “If I make a move in the Martial Arts Academy, won’t everyone know about it? At that time, even if Blackie wins, it won’t be glorious.”

The young girl suddenly understood. She was silent for a moment, and then said tentatively, “Granny Qin, if I can trick him out, can you really give me the bloodline?”

“Of course.” Granny Qin nodded coldly.

The young girl gritted her teeth and said, “Okay! I’ll go!”

After saying that, she walked quickly into the Martial Arts Academy.

Granny Qin’s expression was extremely cold, and her eyes emitted waves of coldness.

She used a secret technique to conceal her internal qi and waited for an entire day at the entrance of Qin Yu’s residence.

However, Qin Yu had no intention of going out at all.

Helpless, Granny Qin picked a student from the Martial Arts Academy and asked her to think of a way to trick Qin Yu Out.

“Little b*stard, your time of death has come!” Granny Qin said with a cold expression.
