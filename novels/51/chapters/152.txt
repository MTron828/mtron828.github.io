Chapter 153: Veteran Inner Strength Past Master! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He didn’t know Wei Ming at all.

Moreover, making friends wasn’t something that could be done with just a few words.

Wei Ming seemed to have seen through Qin Yu’s thoughts, so he changed the topic and said, “Mr. Qin, are you here to have fun? I’m very familiar with this place. Why don’t I bring you around?”

Qin Yu glanced at him and nodded. “Okay, then I’ll have to trouble you.”

Then, Wei Ming brought Qin Yu around the area and almost introduced all the stalls around them.

Unfortunately, none of these were what Qin Yu wanted.

“Are there any herbs here?” Qin Yu asked.

Wei Ming froze, then he smiled and said, “There are, but most of the herbs here are used to swindle those rich people.”

“In other words, most of the herbs here are used to swindle those rich people from other places. They can’t discern good quality herbs from bad quality herbs anyway.”

After listening to Wei Ming’s explanation, Mr. Yang couldn’t help but feel a little embarrassed.

“Mr. Qin, if you want to find herbs, I’ll take you to a place when I have the chance,” Wei Ming said with a smile.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “Okay, thank you.”

Since there were no herbs, there was no need for Qin Yu to stay.

Moreover, he had to attend the Chinese Medical Conference tomorrow, so he had to have a good rest.

Just as Qin Yu was about to leave, Qin Yu suddenly felt an extremely strong internal qi around him.

The fluctuation of this internal qi was almost the strongest one Qin Yu had ever seen other than on Yan Jiang!

Not only that, but his body was filled with killing intent as he approached Qin Yu!

Wei Ming seemed to have also noticed this overwhelming aura and couldn’t help but blurt out, “Inner Strength Past Master?”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and looked around vigilantly.

Not long after, he saw a man slowly walking over from not far away.

“You’re Qin Yu?” This person looked to be around fifty years old, but the muscles on his body didn’t show any signs of aging.

Qin Yu looked at him coldly and said, “Who are you? I don’t think I know you.”

“Someone told me to take your life,” the man said indifferently with his hands behind his back.

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold. Just as he was about to speak, Wei Ming suddenly exclaimed, “Hong... Hong Wu?”

“Hong Wu?” Qin Yu frowned and looked at Wei Ming.

Wei Ming’s expression turned serious. He took a deep breath and explained, “His name is Hong Wu. He is an old Inner Strength Past Master and is well-known in South City. Almost everyone knows him.”

Wei Ming paused and continued, “Mr. Qin, how did you offend such a person?”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “I don’t know him at all.”

“Do you want to come with me, or do you want me to kill you and then take you away?” Hong Wu said with his hands behind his back.

“Mr. Hong!” At this moment, Wei Ming stepped forward and cupped his hands toward Hong Wu.

Hong Wu looked at Wei Ming and frowned. “Are you... that kid from the Wei family?”

Wei Ming quickly said, “Greetings, Mr. Hong.”

Hong Wu nodded slightly and said, “Alright, this had nothing to do with you. You should leave quickly so that you won’t be hurt.”

Upon hearing Hong Wu’s words, Wei Ming gritted his teeth and stepped forward. He cupped his hands and said, “Mr. Hong, Qin Yu is my friend. I don’t know if he has offended you in any way, but please let him go on account of me.”

Hong Wu froze. Then, he frowned and shook his head. “No.”

“Mr. Hong, I. . .” Wei Ming wanted to say something, but Hong Wu waved his hand and berated him, “I said no!”

His voice was deep and sonorous. It contained boundless Inner Strength, and it was so loud that it hurt people’s eardrums.

Wei Ming frowned slightly and stood there without knowing what to do.

“Okay, don’t worry about it.” At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly waved his hand.

“You and I have only just met. Moreover, I’m someone who lives on a high wire. I might die tomorrow. I believe you won’t be so stupid to offend Hong Wu for such a person,” Qin Yu said nonchalantly. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Wei Ming froze, then he said apologetically, “Mr. Qin, I’m really sorry.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly, but he didn’t really mind.

After all, he and Wei Ming had only met by chance, so there was no reason for him to help.

Just as Wei Ming was about to leave, Qin Yu shouted, “Young Master Wei, do me a favor.”

Wei Ming stopped in his tracks, and his expression seemed a little nervous.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Don’t worry. I just want you to take Mr. Yang with you.”

“Mr. Qin, I...” Mr. Yang wanted to say something, but Qin Yu waved his hand and interrupted him.

Wei Ming gritted his teeth, turned around, and dragged Mr. Yang away.

It wasn’t until Mr. Yang was far away that Qin Yu looked at Hong Wu.

Hong Wu put his hands behind his back with indifference.

Obviously, he didn’t take Qin Yu seriously at all.

“Zhou Tong sent you here?” Qin Yu suddenly asked.

Hong Wu shook his head and said, “Do you think I will tell you?”

Qin Yu said with a nonchalant smile, “I’m about to die anyway, so what’s the harm in telling me? Are you afraid that you’re no match for me?”

Hong Wu couldn’t help but laugh and said, “I know that you’re quite capable. You defeated the Liu family and defeated Tao Shan, but unfortunately, you have no chance of winning against me.”

Qin Yu looked at Hong Wu and found that he was a stage three Inner Strength Past Master!

Although he was only two levels higher than the man with the scarred face, there was a huge difference in strength!

“I’ll ask you one last time. Are you coming with me or should I take you with me?” Hong Wu asked coldly.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “You’ll have to see if you have the ability to take me with you.”

“You’re courting death.” Hong Wu’s expression turned cold. He took a step forward, and the terrifying qi energy immediately pressed toward Qin Yu!

This qi energy was extremely powerful, and it even created a hurricane! Even the surrounding stalls were overturned instantly!

Faced with this terrifying pressure, Qin Yu still had his hands behind his back, and wasn’t anxious at all.

“You are quite impressive.” Hong Wu sneered. Suddenly, his feet shook, and this terrifying qi energy became even more powerful!

In an instant, Qin Yu felt as if two mountains were pressing down on his shoulders!

The people around him were also affected, and those who were close to him even vomited blood!

Qin Yu frowned slightly and couldn’t help but lament to himself, “As expected of a veteran Inner Strength Past Master. He is indeed terrifying.”

Hong Wu walked towards Qin Yu step by step. His steps appeared extremely light, but there was also terrifying qi energy in them.

This showed that Hong Wu had mastered the release of Inner Strength!

“Die!” At this moment, Hong Wu suddenly shouted angrily. He clenched his fist, and the dense qi energy smashed towards Qin Yu with the strong wind generated from his punch!
