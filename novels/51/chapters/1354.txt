Chapter 1355: Chapter 1,355, the Sect Master concedes? ! 1

The first elder looked at Wen Wanli coldly. He clenched his fists tightly and his face was full of anger, as if he was going to explode at any moment.

The sect master was rather calm. He sat there without any expression on his face.

“Everyone knows that I, Wen Wanli, have no children. I have been looking for someone to inherit my mantle all these years. Now that I have finally found a beloved disciple, it is indeed not easy,”wen Wanli continued.

“Therefore, I view Qin Yu as my own son. If anyone dares to touch my beloved disciple, I will fight to the death with him even if I have to risk my life!”

When Wen Wanji said this, his eyes swept across the group of people from the Heavenly Cloud sect, whether intentionally or unintentionally.

Although Wen Wanji did not say it explicitly, everyone knew in their hearts that these words were directed at the group of people from the Heavenly Cloud sect.

The first elder who was sitting beside the sect master finally couldn’t hold it in any longer. He slammed the table and stood up, staring coldly at Wen Wanji.

“Wen Wanji, what do you mean!”The first elder shouted angrily.

Wen wanji sneered and said, “I mean it literally. Why? Don’t you understand? It seems that your educational level isn’t high and your comprehension ability is very poor. Do you need me to explain such simple words to you?”

“You!”The first elder was so angry that his chest was heaving up and down, and his veins were throbbing.

Wen wanji continued, “Why? Are you going to die of anger just like that? It seems that your endurance is also very weak.”

The first elder suppressed his anger. He took a deep breath and said, “Wen Wanji, don’t think that my Heavenly Cloud Sect is afraid of You!”

“Of course the Heavenly Cloud sect is not afraid of me, but you may not be,”Wen Wanji sneered and said.

“If you’re not convinced, just come out and have a match. What are you trying to do?”Wen Wanji walked over and stood almost above the first elder.

Such an arrogant attitude really shocked everyone!

Even Qin Yu didn’t expect Wen Wanji to be so tough!

The first elder opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something, but he was a little afraid.

It was obvious that the Great Elder was no match for Wen Wentong.

Helpless, the great elder could only look at the sect master as if he was waiting for the sect master to make a decision for him.

The sect master, who had been silent all this time, finally spoke.

He slowly stood up and said with a faint smile, “Wentong, why are you so angry and hurt the Peace?”

The sect master’s words once again stunned everyone.

Was this really what the sect master of the Tianyun sect said?

One had to know that the sect master of the Tianyun sect had fought in all directions back then and killed countless people, but he had never met an enemy! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Even if the other party was Wen Wanyun, he would not be afraid!

But why was his attitude today so kind?

Wen wanyun obviously did not expect the sect master of the Tianyun sect to be so polite. He frowned and did not know what to say for a moment.

“You are Qin Yu, right?”

Finally, the sect master’s gaze fell on Qin Yu.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Greetings, sect master.”

“Come here, let me take a good look at you,”the sect master said with a smile.

However, Wen Wanji subconsciously blocked Qin Yu behind him.

The sect master smiled and said, “Wanchong, don’t worry. How could I do such a despicable thing in front of so many people?”

Wen Wanfu frowned. He seemed to feel that what he said made sense, so he moved aside.

The sect master sized up Qin Yu and said, “I heard that you were poisoned by the Twilight Qi, so you can’t cultivate?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, sect master, that’s true.”

The sect master was slightly surprised and said, “Then why didn’t you say it? If you had said it earlier, it wouldn’t have ended up like this.”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “I said it, but elder Bai of your sect didn’t believe it and tried to kill me. I had no choice.”

“I see.”The sect master nodded. He stood up and said, “All of this is just a misunderstanding. It shouldn’t have been like this...”

The sect master’s attitude caught everyone off guard.

They thought it would be a big battle, but they didn’t expect it to end like this!

“This matter has to be dealt with eventually,”the sect master continued.

Then, the sect master’s gaze landed on Qin Yu.

He said coldly, “You and My Tianyun sect are all victims. If not for elder Bai’s obstinacy, Ling Yun wouldn’t have died.”

Qin Yu hurriedly nodded. “That’s right! It has nothing to do with me. I don’t want to kill Ling Yun either.”

“I understand.”The sect master nodded and waved his hand. “Alright, you can go now.”

“Thank you, Sect Master.”Qin Yu bowed and retreated to the side.

Wen Wanji didn’t say anything else. Everyone would be happy if he didn’t make a move.

The two of them returned to their own table and sat down. As soon as they sat down, Qin Yu said impatiently, “This is really strange. The sect master of the Tianyun sect is actually so sensible?”

Wen Wentong stroked his beard and muttered, “I also feel that it’s a little strange. This... doesn’t match his style of doing things.”

Not only Wen Wentong, the first elder was also extremely puzzled by this.

He said anxiously, “Sect master, you... Why are you like this! Don’t Tell Me You’re afraid of him, Wen Wentong!”

The sect master glanced at the first elder and shook his head, “I’m not giving him face.”

“Then what is it!”The Great Elder said with great confusion.

The sect master said lightly, “Of course it’s because of this Qin Yu. What I like is his talent.”
