Chapter 660: I’ll Kill You All! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu swept his cold gaze across the crowd. His gaze was like a sharp blade, and no one dared to look him in the eye.

Then, Qin Yu looked at the huge statue in front of him. With a wave of his hand, he smashed the statue into pieces.

After doing all this, Qin Yu looked at Zhen Yue and said in a low voice, “Sect Leader Zhen, I can’t stay here for too long. But don’t worry, I’ll be back at any time.”

Zhen Yue nodded in a daze. She opened her mouth, wanting to say something, but couldn’t.

Qin Yu turned around and left. With Qin Yu’s understanding of the Saint Confucian sect, there must be internal members of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association inside.

Therefore, he believed that it wouldn’t be long before the Jingdu Martial Arts Association found him.

That night, Qin Yu went straight to Jingdu.

Just as Qin Yu had expected, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association received the news not long after he left.

“President Qu, Qin Yu showed up at the Saint Confucian sect and killed Deng Sheng,” The assistant said in a low voice.

Qu Xie’s face turned cold. He couldn’t help but say coldly, “How dare this Qin Yu show himself! Go and locate him immediately!”

The assistant nodded and said, “We have alerted the relevant departments. They are checking the surveillance. As soon as there is any news, they will inform us immediately.”

Qu Xie slowly stood up. He took a deep breath and said, “This time, we must kill Qin Yu no matter what!”

Then, he looked at the assistant and said, “Go, get Geng Si here for me.”

The assistant nodded and said, “Yes.”

Geng Si was a Purple Robe of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. His strength was far above that of the black-gold robe.

With his help, Qin Yu would definitely die!

Soon, Geng Si walked in from outside.

Upon seeing Geng Si, Qu Xie stood up and said politely, “Mr. Geng, I’m afraid I’ll have to trouble you.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Geng Si said coldly, “You just need to give me the time and place.”

Qu Xie smiled. “Don’t worry. We’ve found his tracks. We’ll be able to lock onto his position soon.”

Geng Si turned around and walked out without saying a word.

As a Purple Robe, his status wasn’t any lower than Qu Xie’s.

Besides, the Purple Robes weren’t working under Qu Xie. Usually, they would receive orders from the higher-ups directly.

On the other side, Qin Yu arrived at Jingdu the next morning.

His eyes narrowed slightly. He seemed to be planning something in his mind.

“If I were to be captured by Xia Hang directly, it would be too obvious,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Xia Hang was an important part of Qin Yu’s plan. No mistakes should occur.

After thinking for a while, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

Then, Qin Yu turned around and walked in a certain direction.

On the outskirts of Jingdu, there was a rather luxurious villa.

And the owner of this villa was none other than Yan Guiyi.

After thinking about it, Qin Yu finally decided to make a move on Yan Guiyi.

This way, it would mislead the Jingdu Martial Arts Association into thinking that Qin Yu had intended to take revenge.

In this way, Qin Yu’s appearance near Xia Hang’s home would not arouse suspicion.

Inside the villa.

Yan Guiyi was lying on the sofa in the courtyard, playing with two walnuts in his hands.

Ever since the Black Gold Ball was taken away by He Teng, Yan Guiyi felt that something was missing in his hands.

He stood up slightly and wanted to pour a glass of water, but he was missing an arm, so it was difficult for him to stand up.

This made Yan Guiyi’s face turn cold. He said with a hint of viciousness, “It’s all Qin Yu’s fault... if it weren’t for him, my arm wouldn’t have broken!”

Yan Guiyi sacrificed an arm, but he still couldn’t catch Qin Yu.

Not only that, he even lost his status as a black-gold robe and was demoted to an ordinary white robe!

All of this was because of Qin Yu!

“Yan Guiyi, long time no see.”

Just then, Qin Yu’s voice came from behind.

Yan Guiyi’s expression suddenly changed. He hurriedly turned around and exclaimed, “Qin Yu! You... you still dare to come!”

Qin Yu coldly said, “Why don’t I dare to come?”

Yan Guiyi gritted his teeth and angrily said, “Qin Yu, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association is catching you. You can’t escape! This time, we won’t give you any more chances!”

The corners of Qin Yu’s mouth curled up into a playful smile. He said, “It’s precisely because of this reason that I came to find you.”

“Before I am captured, I will kill all of you!”

Yan Guiyi’s expression changed slightly. He took two steps back and coldly said, “Qin Yu, I warn you that you had better not act recklessly! If you leave now, I will pretend that you never appeared!”

“Oh? Is that so? In that case, I have to thank you?” Qin Yu walked toward Yan Guiyi step by step.

Yan Guiyi became even more panicked. He wanted to inform the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, but he had no chance at all!

“Yan Guiyi, you vicious and despicable person, it’s time for you to pay the price.” Qin Yu was filled with murderous intent as he walked toward Yan Guiyi step by step.

The golden light was incomparably dazzling. The powerful pressure from Qin Yu made Yan Guiyi’s hair stand on end.

“F*ck you!” At this moment, Yan Guiyi suddenly shouted. He held the black-golden light with one hand and swung it at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu did not dodge but raised his hand to meet it head-on.

“Clang!”

The two fists collided, and the Earth and mountains shook immediately.

Yan Guiyi felt waves of pain in his fist, and his bones immediately shattered.

“How could this be...” Yan Guiyi’s face changed drastically.

How could Qin Yu improve so much in just a few months?!

Qin Yu seemed to see through Yan Guiyi’s doubts. He sneered and said, “Speaking of which, I have to thank you. If it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t have been able to obtain a treasure from the Immortal Slaying Sect.”

“The Immortal Slaying Sect’s treasure?!” Yan Guiyi’s face turned as ugly as if he had eaten shit.

“Alright, I don’t have time to talk nonsense with you. After I kill you, I have to find the next opponent,” Qin Yu said coldly.

His body was full of energy, and his fist was emitting a dazzling golden light.

Yan Guiyi knew that this was Qin Yu’s killer move, Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist!

“Die!” Qin Yu shouted angrily, and then he threw a punch at Yan Guiyi.

Yan Guiyi gritted his teeth and summoned all of his internal Qi. He braced himself and went up to meet the punch.

At this moment, a black and golden light shot out from not far away.

The light collided with Qin Yu’s fist, and the terrifying internal Qi shattered the villa directly.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and looked up. He saw the black-gold ball that had saved Yan Guiyi.

“It’s that black-gold ball again.” Qin Yu frowned.

“Qin Yu... long time no see...”

Soon, a hoarse voice came from behind.

Qin Yu turned around and saw a sinister figure.

“He Teng?” Qin Yu’s lips curled into a sneer.

“You came at the right time. I’ll kill you too!” Qin Yu said coldly.
