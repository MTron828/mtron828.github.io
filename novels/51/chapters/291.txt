When Gu Taichu heard this, he couldn’t help but sigh. “I’ve always treated Chi Feng as my son. I’ve already taught him all the cultivation techniques.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

If that was the case, the technique Shrinking Ground Into An Inch wouldn’t be enough.

“What’s wrong?” Gu Taichu asked.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Nothing.”

Then, Qin Yu turned around and returned to continuing to search for related cultivation techniques.

It had to be said that the inheritance left behind by his father was a treasure trove.

After all, these were cultivation techniques of the divine cultivation world. Even if all the great aristocratic families in the world were added together, they probably couldn’t be compared to it.

In a short while, Qin Yu found a cultivation technique that was extremely suitable for him.

“With this cultivation technique, I might win” Qin Yu’s lips curled up into a cold smile.

Time flew by.

In the blink of an eye, there was only one day left until the battle between Qin Yu and Chi Feng.

These few days, Chi Feng had been living quite comfortably and was sitting in the courtyard all day while basking in the sun.

He didn’t have much ambition, nor did he think of continuing to increase his strength.

To Chi Feng, his current strength was enough for him to dominate a region.

“After I kill Qin Yu, my name will definitely take the entire Jiang Bei region by storm.” Chi Feng couldn’t help but sneer.

At this moment, Qin Yu and Gu Taichu were rushing back.

“Qin Yu, do you really have a way to deal with this?” Gu Taichu looked extremely worried.

Qin Yu smiled. “Master Gu, don’t worry, I won’t recklessly endanger my life.”

Gu Taichu didn’t say anything more.

The three of them quickly returned to the Gu family’s home.

A few days of cultivation made Qin Yu somewhat tired.

After washing up, he prepared to rest for a while.

After lying on the bed, Qin Yu quickly fell into a deep sleep.

The sky gradually darkened, and Qin Yu opened his eyes in a daze.

“Phew, luckily, I didn’t oversleep this time.” Qin Yu glanced at the time and thought to himself.

However, an uninvited guest arrived outside the door.

This person was none other than Dong Tianhai.

“Master Gu, I observed the Danyun Phenomenon in your direction not long ago,” Dong Tianhai said courteously.

“Did this Danyun Phenomenon come from Qin Yu?” Dong Tianhai asked.

Gu Taichu nodded and said, “Yes, it came from Qin Yu.”

Dong Tianhai said in a deep voice, “Qin Yu is really arrogant to the extreme! Just because he has a bit of talent, he doesn’t take us older generations seriously!”

Gu Taichu raised his eyebrows, as if he was a little surprised.

Dong Tianhai waved his hand, and his disciple immediately brought over a box made of sandalwood.

Gu Taichu could smell the fragrance inside the box.

“Master Gu, I specially prepared this for you.” Dong Tianhai respectfully handed over the herbs.

Gu Taichu took the wooden box and opened it to take a look.

He saw that there was a ginseng inside.

“This ginseng is probably more than 500 years old,” Gu Taichu muttered.

Dong Tianhai smiled. “That’s right.”

“I can’t accept such a generous gift.” Gu Taichu pushed the herbs back.

Dong Tianhai laughed out loud. “Master Gu, since I’m called the Medicine King, what’s a mere 500-year-old ginseng to me?”

Gu Taichu frowned and said with some confusion, “Dong Tianhai, you and I don’t seem to have any friendship. What do you mean by suddenly sending the herb?”

Dong Tianhai’s expression instantly turned cold when he heard that.

“Master Gu, since Qin Yu dares to provoke us, he must have some abilities,” Dong Tianhai said.

“I’ve seen him in combat before. His strength is beyond imagination. Even a rank three Inner Strength Grandmaster wouldn’t be able to retaliate against him.”

Dong Tianhai didn’t know that Qin Yu had borrowed the power of the Earth Fiend Valley’s ancestor.

Therefore, in his opinion, Gu Taichu might not be Qin Yu’s match.

This made Gu Taichu somewhat surprised.

Qin Yu was actually so strong? Could it be that he had hidden his strength?

Then, Dong Tianhai continued, “This herb might be able to give you a helping hand and kill Qin Yu!”

Hearing this, Gu Taichu finally understood.

Dong Tianhai thought that Qin Yu was here to settle scores with Gu Taichu. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Just as Gu Taichu was about to explain, Dong Tianhai continued, “Master Gu, I only have one request.”

Gu Taichu wanted to hear what Dong Tianhai wanted to say.

Thus, Gu Taichu nodded and said, “Go ahead.”

Dong Tianhai said with a gloomy expression, “Master Gu, you know that I have always been interested in refining medicine, and Qin Yu has the pill formula that I want!”

“But Qin Yu is too arrogant! I put down my dignity to beg him, but not only did he not agree, but he even humiliated me!”

At this point, Dong Tianhai paused and continued, “Master Gu, I only beg you to hand it over to me before you kill him!”

“As long as I get the pill formula, I will definitely give you another ginseng as a thank-you gift!”

Gu Taichu’s eyes couldn’t help but narrow.

He didn’t expect that Dong Tianhai actually had the intention to kill Qin Yu!

“If you want the pill formula so much, why don’t you come and ask me directly?”

At this moment, a hand reached over and snatched the ginseng over.

He saw Qin Yu walk out of the room, and he nibbled on this ginseng like it was a carrot.
