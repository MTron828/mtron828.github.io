Everyone’s eyes were looking into the distance.

They saw an elegant young master stepping into the air. He stretched out his hand and the sword returned to his hand.

This person was none other than Qu Zhu.

There was a pot of wine on his waist. He held a sword in his hand and looked at the black-robed man in front of him lazily.

“You bastards are really ruthless,”qu Zhu said indifferently.

“It’s Qu Zhu! Qu Zhu is here. We Are Saved!”

“Qu Zhu? Qu Zhu, one of the three uniques?”

The city Lord of Gu City hurriedly looked at Qu Zhu and cupped his hands. “Greetings, senior Qu Zhu.”

Qu Zhu nodded at him and then his gaze fell on these people.

“After killing so many people, aren’t you afraid that you won’t be able to sleep?”Qu Zhu said indifferently.

The black-robed man coldly berated, “Qu Zhu, you can’t be arrogant for too long. Soon, someone will come and take care of you.”

“Oh? Someone will come and take care of me?”Qu Zhu was slightly surprised.

“That’s right!”

At this moment, another explosive shout came from behind!

Then, a strong man walked over. He had a bald head and a fierce look on his face.

This person was none other than Baro.

Baro looked at Qu Zhu coldly and said, “Qu Zhu, your opponent is me.”

Qu Zhu frowned slightly and said, “Baro, you are from the South Province.”

“I am not from anywhere.”Baro said coldly.

“To be honest, I have always been curious about your strength. It is said that you defeated the deputy sect leader of the Heavenly Cloud sect in a few moves back then. From then on, you were known as the three unique of the South Province.”

“But in my eyes, this achievement is not worth mentioning. I can crush that kind of person to death with a single finger.”

Qu Zhu laughed. He looked at Baro in front of him and said, “So?”

“So, I think you’re not that good either.”Baro sneered.

“Looking at your skinny and weak appearance, I’m afraid that I’ll accidentally break your bones!”

“Stop talking nonsense, let’s do it.”Qu Zhu’s expression finally turned cold.

He held the treasured sword in his hand, and it radiated in all directions. Countless Dao technique interweaved under his sword, and it was as if golden lines were spreading out. Under his treasured sword, it headed straight for Baro.

Baro’s strength was naturally not to be underestimated. He was one of the three madmen, and now that he had cultivated the northern land’s sacred heart technique, his strength had increased greatly.

The great battle was about to start. Baro did not hide his strength at all. He immediately activated the Sacred Heart technique and prepared to quickly kill Qu Zhu.

However, qu Zhu’s figure was graceful, and his methods were incomparably fierce. For a time, the two were unable to part.

Just as Qu Zhu and Baro were fighting, a guest also came to the temple of no fate.

Feng Hai stood behind the monk of the rosette kingdom and pressed his palms together toward the Buddha statue in front of him.

“Master, do you think Buddha will forgive someone like me?”Feng Hai asked calmly.

With his back facing Feng Hai, the monk of Hongxi said slowly, “Put down the butcher’s knife and become Buddha.”

“Oh? Buddha will forgive someone like me?”Feng Hai was surprised.

The monk of Hongxi bowed and said, “Buddha is merciful.”

“Hahahahaha!”Hearing this, Feng Hai couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“So, even if I kill everyone, Buddha will still forgive me? “If that’s the case, why should I put down the butcher’s Knife Now? “When I kill to my heart’s content, when I’m tired of it, won’t I Still Be Forgiven?”Feng Hai sneered.

He narrowed his eyes and said, “Is the belated justice really meaningful?”

As he spoke, Feng Hai’s body emitted a strong killing intent, and his internal Qi was rapidly rising.

In the next second, the entire temple of no fate was reduced to ruins, and the battle began in an instant.

...

It seemed that no one in the southern region was spared.

The northern region had sent three waves of people, and these three waves of people swept through the southern region wantonly, making people wish they were dead.

Teng men.

Rui Yi brought three black-robed men and descended here.

Looking at He Teng, who was sitting on the throne, Rui Yi went straight to the point, “He teng, I’ll give you a chance. Join our Northern Region and serve the Lord.”

He Teng’s face revealed an extremely sinister and strange smile. He narrowed his eyes and said, “Oh? Are you informing me?”

Rui Yi put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “You can understand it that way.”

“What if I don’t agree?”He Teng said with a smile.

Rui Yi snorted coldly and said, “If you don’t agree, today will be the day you die!”

“Little girl, you talk big.”He Teng licked his lips and stood up from the throne.

Rui Yi narrowed his eyes and shouted, “If that’s the case, then don’t blame me for being Rude!”

He Teng did not waste any words. He took out the white bone club and smashed it!

All of Rui Yi’s spells were not worth mentioning in front of the white bone club. They were instantly destroyed!

Her delicate and sexy body was sent flying!

He Teng disappeared into the darkness. In the blink of an eye, he emerged from the void behind Rui Yi.

He reached out his hand and hooked Rui Yi’s snow-white neck.

The tremendous force, coupled with the injuries on his body, made Rui Yi unable to move.

He Teng hooked his arm around Rui Yi’s neck. He stuck out his tongue and said sinisterly, “Speaking of which, it seems like I haven’t touched a woman in a long time...”

Rui Yi’s expression changed, and he quickly said, “What do you want!”

“Guess,”he teng said sinisterly.

The next second, he teng directly broke Rui Yi’s limbs and brought him into the room.

Half an hour later, the half-dead Rui Yi was thrown out of the room, while he teng had a satisfied look on his face.

He licked his lips, stood in front of Rui Yi, and said flatly, “Next time you talk to me, be careful of your tone...”

Rui Yi gritted her teeth, tears streaming down the corners of her eyes.

As an evil person, she felt that he teng was ten to a hundred times more vicious than she was!

“What is that in your hands?”At this moment, he teng suddenly noticed the scroll in the hands of the black robed men.

The faces of the black robed men immediately changed, and they subconsciously took two steps back.

However, he teng immediately smashed their heads and snatched the scroll. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“TSK TSK, good stuff.”He Teng placed it on the tip of his nose and sniffed greedily.

Rui Yi gritted his teeth and said, “You can’t touch that thing. Otherwise, the northern lands won’t let you off!”

He Teng’s eyes narrowed slightly. He walked in front of Rui Yi, grabbed her hair, and violently lifted her up.

“Didn’t I tell you to watch your tone when you talk to me...”he teng said grimly.

“I was going to let you go, but I’ve changed my mind now.”He teng sized Rui Yi up with a lecherous look.

“Keeping you here seems like a good idea...”

He Teng’s words were like silver needles piercing Rui Yi’s heart. Her face immediately became filled with despair.
