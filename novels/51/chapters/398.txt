Chapter 399: In the Huge Pit Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Mr. Tang was a spiritual master, and this mark could clearly tell what was going on in her mind!

But now, Qin Yu could no longer find a suitable reason to stop him. He could only watch helplessly!

The light on Mr. Tang’s finger pointed towards the center of Xiao Yu’s brows.

Qin Yu’s heart instantly thumped! He mobilized the internal qi in his body and was ready to use the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique to escape at any time!

The light landed on the space between Xiao Yu’s eyebrows and Mr. Tang closed his eyes slightly.

A moment later, Mr. Tang slowly opened his eyes.

“How is it?” Yan Haoran asked.

Mr. Tang shook his head and said, “What this girl said is true.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but widen his eyes!

What was going on? Mr. Tang actually didn’t see through it?

Could it be that... Mr. Tang wasn’t a spiritual master at all?

“Well, in that case, you can go down.” Yan Haoran waved his hand.

Xiao Yu snorted lightly and then walked to Qin Yu’s side.

“You two, go down.” Yan Haoran pointed at the huge pit and said.

Before Qin Yu could say anything, Jing Shihong kicked Qin Yu’s butt from behind.

With this kick, Qin Yu staggered and almost fell into the huge pit.

“D*mn it, just you wait!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse inside.

Then, Qin Yu looked at Xiao Yu and said, “Hurry up and go down.”

Xiao Yu glared at Qin Yu and said, “It’s none of your business!”

Qin Yu immediately grabbed Xiao Yu and jumped into the huge pit.

The moment they jumped in, a gust of cold dark energy completely devoured the two of them!

The huge pit was dozens of meters deep! Qin Yu didn’t dare to be negligent. He immediately cast a spell that gently carried Xiao Yu before slowly falling into the huge pit.

“How is it? Are you dead?” Jing Shihong’s voice came from above.

Qin Yu looked up at the ray of light in the sky and shouted, “I’m not dead! Nothing happened at all!”

“Huh? Really?” Above, Jing Shihong was a little surprised.

Yan Haoran was silent for a moment and said, “Since nothing happened, let’s go down.”

After saying that, he glanced at the crowd and said, “Who is willing to go down?”

Jing Shihong immediately took a step back. As a suspicious person by nature, he didn’t dare to act rashly.

“I’ll go down!” Someone volunteered to show off in front of Yan Haoran.

After saying that, he took a big step and directly jumped into the huge pit.

“Ah!!!”

The moment he jumped into the huge pit, they heard a scream!

“Bang!”

In the end, a skeleton fell in front of Qin Yu.

“Hiss!”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but gasp.

The dark energy here was actually so terrifying? It directly the body of a peak-stage Inner Strength Grandmaster?

“Are you dead?” Jing Shihong’s voice came from above.

But this time, no one answered him.

Above, Yan Haoran couldn’t help but frown.

“What’s going on? That dude in the green hat didn’t die. Why did he die when he went down?” Yan Haoran said in a deep voice.

“Could it be related to that pure dark energy body?” Someone guessed.

“It must be! That dude in the green hat is only an Inner Strength Past Master. He definitely can’t resist this dark energy!”

Yan Haoran’s frown deepened

Xiao Yu had already been brought into the huge pit by Qin Yu. They had no way to enter this huge pit.

“Looks like we can only rely on that dude in the green hat.” Yan Haoran rubbed his chin and said in a deep voice.

Then, Yan Haoran shouted at the huge pit, “Listen well. I’m giving you a chance now. As long as you can bring me the treasure, I can give you a chance to serve the Yan family!”

In the huge pit, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

He thought for a moment and then said, “Young Master Yan, if I bring the treasure, can you make me the boss of the northern region?”

As soon as he said this, the expressions of the people above immediately darkened.

“This kid is asking for too much!” Jing Shihong cursed.

“Hmph, since he dares to come to such a place as an Inner Strength Past Master, it means that he is a greedy person.”

“Young Master Yan, you can’t agree to him!”

Yan Haoran didn’t say anything. He looked down and said coldly, “Okay, I agree.”

“Then thank you, Young Master Yan.” Qin Yu sneered.

The boss of the north? As if he would believe him?

Him working for the Yan family? Dream on!

Above, Jing Shihong and the others were suddenly anxious.

“Young Master Yan, how can you let an Inner Strength Past Master be the leader of the northern martial arts world?!”

“Yeah, this kid is useless. He’s just cannon fodder. He can’t rule over the masses!”

Yan Haoran glanced at them and sneered. “Satisfy him first. As soon as he brings the treasure to me, kill him immediately.”

Hearing that, everyone suddenly understood.

“Young Master Yan is so smart!” Jing Shihong said with a smile.

“Young Master Yan is really good at strategizing! He has the same acumen as Old Mister Yan!”

Although they flattered Yan Haoran, they didn’t realize that they had unknowingly fallen into Qin Yu’s trap.

Through asking for conditions, Qin Yu shed light on a question.

After the Yan family unified the northern martial arts world, who would be the boss?

Everyone here was among the first batch of people, so who could lead them?

“D*mn it, the boss of the northern martial arts world can only be me!” Jing Shihong thought inside.

Not only Jing Shihong, but the others also had the same thoughts.

...

The huge pit fell into a brief silence.

Xiao Yu couldn’t wait to ask, “Qin Yu, why are you dressed like this? And who are they?”

Seeing Xiao Yu’s terrified look, Qin Yu smiled and said, “Don’t worry. Focus on cultivating. When we go up, I’ll take revenge for you.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Really?” Xiao Yu said in surprise.

Qin Yu’s eyes flashed, and he sneered. “Really.”

At this point, Qin Yu couldn’t help but ask, “Why didn’t Mr. Tang notice that you were lying?”

“Huh? Lying? What lie?” Xiao Yu asked in confusion.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Wasn’t what you just said to them a lie?”

“No, I really jumped down,” Xiao Yu said with a smile.

Qin Yu suddenly understood.

No wonder Mr. Tang didn’t detect it. It was because Xiao Yu didn’t lie at all.

“You’re really brave. Weren’t you afraid that there was danger here? Maybe some thousand-year-old ghost could have eaten you directly,” Qin Yu said to scare Xiao Yu.

“Tsk, what ghost could be there?! There was quite a lot of treasure,” Xiao Yu muttered.

At this point, Xiao Yu said mysteriously, “I found a treasure here, but I didn’t dare to take it! Let’s go, I’ll take you to have a look!”
