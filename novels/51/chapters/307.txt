Chapter 308: Completely Annihilated! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s words were rather arrogant, which made Commander Long even more displeased.

“You mean you’re better than Ye Qing?” Commander Long asked with an aloof smile.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Of course I’m no match for Officer Ye, but if it’s a one-round training plan, my plan might be better.”

Just as Qin Yu said, the inheritance treasury left behind by his father was definitely not something Ye Qing could compare to.

Commander Long said with a sulky look, “Nonsense! Mr. Wu, ask him to leave!”

“Commander Long, Qin Yu, he...”

“I said, ask him to leave!” Commander Long berated.

Mr. Wu had no choice but to pull Qin Yu’s arm.

After the two of them walked out of the office, Mr. Wu said, “Qin Yu, don’t take offense. After all, your words are shocking. Moreover, Commander Long has always regarded Ye Qing as his idol, so it’s natural that he won’t accept it.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I understand.”

“As for Commander Long, I’ll go and persuade him again,” said Mr. Wu.

Qin Yu forced a smile and said, “Mr. Wu, do you think your persuasion will be useful? Commander Long’s attitude is firm. I’m afraid that no matter what you say, he won’t accept it.”

Mr. Wu frowned and said, “Then what should we do?”

“Just wait,” said Qin Yu indifferently.

“I’ve seen his special training plan. In five days at most, the special training team members will start to collapse.”

“At that time, I’ll come up with my own plan.”

Although that was the case, Mr. Wu was still a little worried.

“What if Commander Long thinks that it’s normal for them to collapse?” Mr. Wu asked back.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “When I say that they will collapse, I mean that their bodies will reach their limit and they won’t be able to continue at all.”

Mr. Wu suddenly understood. He said in a deep voice, “Qin Yu, we don’t have much time left. Isn’t five days a waste of time?”

Qin Yu spread his hands out and said, “Mr. Wu, do you have a better idea?”

“No.” Mr. Wu shook his head.

“See,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

Mr. Wu could only do as Qin Yu said.

Then, Qin Yu followed Mr. Wu back to his residence.

When the two of them went back, Yao Qing was sitting there while Xiao Yu was watching TV.

After seeing Qin Yu, Xiao Yu hurriedly stood up.

“Why did you come back so soon?” Xiao Yu said with a bit of surprise.

“It’s adults’ business, so don’t ask!” Mr. Wu glared at him.

Qin Yu smiled and patted Xiao Yu’s head. “I’ll come back when I’m done.”

Xiao Yu nodded. Then, she said slyly, “Qin Yu, can you teach me? I want to be a top-notch martial artist too, okay?”

“Xiao Yu! Don’t bother Qin Yu!” Mr. Wu scolded.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “It’s fine. I was just about to teach Xiao Yu my breathing exercise.”

“Really? Yay! Long live Qin Yu!” Xiao Yu shouted excitedly.

Jiang Gu had said that Xiao Yu had a pure dark energy body constitution.

This kind of body’s cultivation speed was much faster than ordinary people’s.

The only regret was that pure dark energy body’s could only be cultivated by dark energy.

As for inner strength and spiritual energy, they couldn’t be absorbed.

“Come with me.” Qin Yu brought Xiao Yu to the courtyard.

Then, he let Xiao Yu sit cross-legged on the ground and taught her the breathing exercise.

Xiao Yu was very talented. In just an hour, she knew how to do the breathing exercise.

The only pity was that dark energy was scarce in the city.

Therefore, Xiao Yu couldn’t sense the inhaling sensation that Qin Yu mentioned.

“Am I too stupid?” Xiao Yu said with some frustration.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No, you are very talented, much more talented than Yao Qing’s.”

“Of course!” Xiao Yu immediately looked at Yao Qing proudly.

Yao Qing said with a troubled look, “Mr. Qin, can you not compare her with me?”

“It’s the truth,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

“If I’m so talented, why can’t I feel the inhaling sensation you mentioned? And I can’t feel anything in my lower abdomen,” Xiao Yu muttered.

Qin Yu rubbed Xiao Yu’s head and said, “That’s because this place isn’t suitable for cultivation. When I’m done, I’ll take you somewhere.”

“Deal!” Xiao Yu said excitedly.

In the next few days, Qin Yu stayed in his room almost all day.

Except for meals, he was nowhere to be seen.

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

In the training field of the Chuzhou region.

“Captain Xue, I don’t think I can hold on any longer,” a team member said with a troubled look.

“Actually, I also have this feeling. I keep feeling like my body has become extremely heavy, and the bones in my limbs feel like they’re about to break.”

With someone taking the lead, almost everyone began to complain.

Xue Hu berated, “All of you, shut up! Don’t you guys know that pleasure comes through toil? As long as you hold on, your strength will be greatly improved!”

“But... but this is too torturous,” a team member said softly.

Xue Hu was instantly enraged when he heard that.

He raised his foot and kicked the lower abdomen of that team member. He berated, “You can scram! Longhu team doesn’t need trash like you!”

When everyone saw this, they didn’t dare to say anything. They could only brace themselves and continue training.

“Xue Hu, how’s the training?” At this time, Commander Long walked over from not far away.

Xue Hu hurriedly said, “Commander Long, please rest assured. I promise to complete the mission!”

Commander Long frowned and said, “I just heard them say that their bodies can’t take it? Could there be something wrong? Let me tell you, safety is always the first priority.”

Xue Hu hurriedly said, “Commander Long, this is the uniqueness of this training plan. As long as they can endure it, they will improve by leaps and bounds!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Commander Long nodded, then turned around and left.

Although that was the case, Commander Long couldn’t help but think of Qin Yu’s words.

If it was really as Qin Yu said, then things would be troublesome.

Another day passed.

Qin Yu finally walked out of the room.

He stretched lazily and muttered, “I’m so tired.”

“Qin Yu, what have you been doing in the room for the past few days?” Mr. Wu asked with a puzzled look.

Qin Yu said mysteriously, “I won’t tell you! You’ll know tomorrow.”

At night, the members of the Longhu team still didn’t stop training.

They followed the plan provided by Xue Hu and tried their best.

“Pu!”

At this moment, one of the team members suddenly spat out blood and fell to the ground. He was unable to get up anymore!

“What’s going on?” Xue Hu’s expression changed and he hurriedly walked over.

As everyone was feeling shocked, another person fell to his knees with a plop!

He was in pain, and cold sweat was dripping down his face.

“My... my leg is broken! I can’t move my leg!” That member shouted in pain.

In the blink of an eye, everyone started to experience all kinds of symptoms.

Some people were vomiting blood, while others had their bones shattered!

In the blink of an eye, 14 out of the 18 members had fallen!

“How... how could this be?!” Xue Hu panicked. He didn’t know what to do.

“Doctor! Call a doctor!” At this moment, someone shouted in a hurry.

Fortunately, the military district was equipped with doctors. In a short while, several doctors rushed over.

They brought the dozen or so members to the infirmary in a flurry.

Xue Hu stood at the door. His expression was a little ugly, and he was extremely anxious.

After an unknown amount of time, the doctor finally walked out.

“Doctor, how are their conditions?” Xue Hu hurriedly walked forward and asked.

The doctor said with a solemn expression, “Not good. Their bodies have suffered various degrees of damage. Some of them even have fractures all over their bodies. It’s almost impossible for them to continue training.”
