2072 Returning to Donghuang

“Your Si family is so arrogant!” Qin Yu sneered and said. “However, I’d like to see if the Si family can find me.”

Qin Yu was not in the mood to waste time with this old thing. He hurriedly stepped on the line word formula and transformed into a stream of light as he sped away. Nearly in the blink of an eye, he disappeared into the horizon.

The Supreme Elder of the Si family did not chase after Qin Yu because, with the mark, he could find Qin Yu at any time.

At this point, Qin Yu was unaware that having killed Si Shifeng and taken the Traceless Immortal Scripture had completely infuriated the Si family and caused them to start taking endless revenge on him.

Qin Yu fled straightaway to the teleportation formation and prepared to return to Nanzhaou straightaway.

!!

Once he reached Nanzhou, he would find a way to go to Donghuang.

The Si family surely would act very quickly, and Qin Yu did not have time to think.

Even if he could protect his life with the help of the Mysterious Heavenly Mirror, the Si family would have a way as long as they made up their minds to attack him.

“As long as I can comprehend the Traceless Immortal Scripture, I don’t have to care about the bulls*it Si family,” Qin Yu said frantically in his heart.

He returned to Nanzhou, which he was familiar with. Standing on the land of Nanzhou, he could not help but look at the southernmost region, Lizhou, where the most unique place, Thunder Courtyard, was situated.

Qin Yu was silent, feeling a little conflicted in his heart.

The news of the Traceless Immortal Scripture probably could not be hidden for long. After all, only Qin Yu had entered and walked out of the Chaos Grave unscathed.

Once they discovered the Traceless Immortal Scripture was gone and the coffin opened, all their eyes would be on Qin Yu.

At that time, not only would the Si family be furious, but all the aristocratic families in the world would also attack Qin Yu!

Although Thunder Courtyard was strong, they would probably not fear the existence of Thunder Courtyard for the Traceless Immortal Scripture.

“This calamity… It’s better not to bring it to Thunder Courtyard.” Qin Yu took a deep breath and finally canceled his plan. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

After much thought, he decided to go to Donghuang.

Donghuang was a very unique place, also the place that Xiao Sheng yearned for the most.

The last time they parted ways, Xiao Sheng had planned to go to Donghuang to cultivate. Now, Qin Yu was probably going there as well.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to waste time. Nanzhou was quite far from Donghuang. Even with Qin Yu’s speed, it would take a long time. Therefore, he immediately set off and headed straight for Donghuang.

On the other end, the news that Si Shifeng had been killed quickly spread to the Si family. Before the Si family could seal the news, it had spread to most of Zhongzhou.

This instantly infuriated the Si family. The Holy Lord of the Si family had been bedridden out of anger earlier. After hearing this news, he vomited blood again.

He raised his trembling hand as if he had used up his last strength and said in a trembling voice, “Kill him… Kill him! Kill everyone related to him!”

The Si family was instantly in chaos. To prevent anything unexpected, they immediately sealed off the mountain gate.

The outside world was discussing this endlessly. They had never thought that Qin Yu would kill Si Shifeng!

Although Si Shifeng could not compare to Si Shiyue and Si Shiyu, he was still the heir of the Si family.

And this heir was killed by a rogue cultivator with no background. This was simply a slap to the Si family’s face!

“The Holy Lord of the Si family is unconscious, and the Si family has sealed off the mountain gate. It seems that there will be an upheaval in the Si family this time.”

“Every family needs a backbone. The Holy Lord of the Si family is unconscious, so the Si family is falling apart now.”

A few days later, news came from the Si family.

The three Supreme Elders of the Si family came out of the mountain and made Si Shiyue the acting Holy Lord temporarily, being assisted by the three Supreme Elders.

The three Supreme Elders had been sleeping soundly for many years, and their cultivation had long entered the True Saint Realm.

Now that they were forced to leave the mountain, the difficult situation of the Si family was evident.

“The Si family is probably the first aristocratic family to send out a True Saint.”

“Yeah, rumor has it that the Si family is serious this time. No matter who is related to Qin Yu, they can’t escape their pursuit.”

“The Si family sent eight True Saints to trample all those who have a grudge against the Si family!”

The Holy Region was in turmoil instantly, and the various large sects were trembling.

The sects that once had grudges against the Si family came to the Si family one after another to seek their forgiveness. They even took the initiative to send generous gifts to the Si family.

In the Si family, Si Shiyue’s expression was cold. As heaven’s favorite, he was not interested in the position of the Holy Lord.

However, the current situation was no longer up to him.

He looked down coldly and saw thousands of cultivators below.

Wearing armor and holding divine weapons, they were all incomparably brave.

Si Shiyue took a deep breath and shouted, “Starting now, the Si family is officially going on an expedition. Whoever holds a grudge against the Si family, we will kill them all and leave no one alive!”

Following Si Shiyue’s order, a shocking roar came from below!

“Yes, sir!”

Thousands of people flew across the sky, covering the sky like a massive cloud.

Several True Saints of the Si family had even personally launched a massacre in the Holy Region!

An elderly man stood beside Si Shiyue. His name was Si Qianjing. He had served the Si family for many years, and his strength was unfathomable.

“When Liu He comes out of seclusion, the Si family will sweep the world.” Si Qianjing’s voice sounded a little hoary. Apparently, his vital energy had also depreciated.

Si Shiyue was silent. After a while, he slowly stood up and said, “Go to the Jiang family. No matter what, I want the supreme bone.”

…

At this moment, Qin Yu was rushing toward Donghuang.

Donghuang was once a wasteland, but it had also given birth to numerous heroes. It was tremendously mysterious.

Qin Yu also obtained the dragon blood from this place.

When Qin Yu stepped into Donghuang again, the place had indeed changed greatly.

Everything was just as Xiao Sheng had predicted. This place was no longer a wasteland. Instead, green plants were growing here, and they looked full of vitality.

This once-forgotten land was now full of vitality. On the vast wilderness, green grass was widespread on the entire land like a green carpet.

The ancient saplings that had been silent for many years seemed to have woken up overnight. The leaves and branches were lush and extended to the sky, covering the sky and the sun.

Qin Yu was incredibly surprised. He rubbed his eyes, unable to believe this was the former Donghuang!

“It seems that Xiao Sheng has deduced it right. His comprehension of the Great Dao of heaven and earth and even the rules of the dao technique has long been very clear…” Qin Yu murmured, incomparably shocked.

After that, Qin Yu released his divine sense. He wanted to see if there were any human movements in the current Donghuang. However, as soon as he released his divine sense, that prickling feeling attacked again!

It was as if countless eyes were staring at him in the dark, but Qin Yu failed to capture the exact source of these gazes.
