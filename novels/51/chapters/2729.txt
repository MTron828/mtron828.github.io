Chapter 2730 - 2730: The Change

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Every red line here represented a restriction. The dense red lines here represented countless restrictions.

At this moment, the folding of space and the fog were somehow smoothed out by a force. The restrictive forces gathered in the air.

Qin Yu felt cold sweat all over his body. If all these blood-baby monitors exploded, even the Night Qi could not save him.

Qin Yu did not dare to move, afraid that he would trigger some taboo.

At this moment, the ground suddenly trembled slightly.

An ancient internal qi suddenly burst out at a place afar from Qin Yu. A sky-high energy raged out.

“Unable to move?”

When Qin Yu sensed that internal qi, he realized that he could not escape no matter how hard he tried.

He couldn’t move or touch the Soul Suppression Ring with his thumb.

In the next moment, his thoughts froze.

His pupils focused on the place where the change had happened. He couldn’t help but stare at the scene in front of him.

There was a black shadow soaring into the sky. It was a bronze tombstone that reached straight into the clouds.

There were only two words on it that kept being stretched out, ‘Zui Ren’ (sinner).

Blood flowed from the two sunken words and then fell like a waterfall.

Sticky blood flowed from the huge edge and gradually gathered on the ground.

The blood seemed to be endless. Qin Yu only felt a freezing liquid slowly rising under his feet.

The sticky blood rose to his calf. He did not know how long it had been.

Qin Yu was unable to move or think.

His gaze was locked on the huge word ‘sinner’ and his eyes could not leave the gravestone that was oozing blood.

In the next moment, the scene in front of him suddenly disappeared.

A bright red hand seal had appeared on his chest.

Everything in front of him suddenly returned to its previous state.

Qin Yu wondered if everything that had just happened was an illusion.

“What’s going on? Was that huge place a tomb? To be able to affect everyone’s power and even make me unable to resist at all, what kind of tomb is this?” Qin Yu’s heart was in turmoil. He looked at the bloody hand seal on his chest and felt a strong sense of unease.

“What the he*l is this? Brothers, do you have any on you?”

Qin Yu ran into a group of people on his way back to the city.

They seemed to have the same strange bloody hand seal on their bodies. Qin Yu frowned.

It seemed like everyone nearby had been affected.

What exactly was this thing? Qin Yu sensed it but he did not discover any energy fluctuations.

However, Qin Yu felt even more terrified because of this.

A mark that had silently appeared on his body. What exactly was this? What would happen once this mark erupted?

No matter what, Qin Yu felt that it was not a good thing.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Could it be that I was chosen by the tomb that suddenly appeared?”

A man suddenly guessed.

“Go to he*l! You don’t even deserve that ugly look of yours. It doesn’t seem like an illusion just now. The few groups of people we encountered all had this mark on them. It might be the proof that we’ve been to that place.”

Another person muttered.

There was a type of inheritance that had appeared in Lingxu City before. Only those who were born within a thousand meters of it could enter.

“Let’s return to Lingxu City first. It’s estimated that quite many people have begun to explore this area now.”

The team slowly left.

However, they did not realize that a bloody smell rose into the sky near Lingxu City after the huge tomb had disappeared.

In an instant, countless people had already died under the restriction.

Qin Yu stared at the place in front of him solemnly. Countless red ropes were scattered from various spaces.

The blood eagles of different sizes revealed strange smiles. This was derived from the restrictive power between the tombs.

Qin Yu discovered that only a tiny portion of this restrictive power was emitted on the ground previously.

However, the power seemed to have fully appeared now after the huge tomb appeared.

Qin Yu did not dare to relax for a moment. He maintained the form of the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze.

They started to rush back to the city. Along the way, corpses could be seen everywhere.

Almost all of these people had accidentally triggered the restrictive power and caused it to explode.

Even Qin Yu who cultivated the Night Qi was injured. Those below Dao Realm level 10 might not survive even if they triggered the weakest restriction.

Qin Yu casually picked up the space rings of the three corpses in front. Then, he flicked out a wisp of divine flame and burned the two corpses into ashes.

“Don’t blame me, brother. I took your ring but I also helped you settle your body.”

Qin Yu put away their space rings. Along the way, he had already taken nearly fifty rings.

These were all the storage items of the adventurers here. The finances inside were worth a lot of money. At least, it could ensure he would not be in a tight spot after entering the city.

Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief. After nearly half a day of traveling, this place was already very close to Lingxu City.

He could already faintly see the shadows of those buildings in Lingxu City.

Suddenly, he stopped. A bald man with a bare upper body appeared in front of Qin Yu.

He was leaning against a tree. There were nearly a hundred corpses around him.

However, what was terrifying was that there was not a single wound on his body.

“This is a good opportunity to kill and rob.”

Qin Yu said with a smile. Many people had died in the tomb that had just appeared.

Just a group of people was impossible to finish searching such a huge place. Hence, this person waited here in front of Lingxu City.

“Leave all your storage bags behind, or I’ll help you.”

The bald man grinned. A barely noticeable killing intent flashed in his eyes. Even if Qin Yu obeyed his words, he would probably not let him leave. “Limit the strength at Dao Realm level 10. Is this your limit?”

Qin Yu looked around and a blood infant appeared in the air. This red line contained the power of Dao Realm level 10.

Once the power exceeded this level, the blood-baby would explode.

“Brother, you’re not simple since you can see this restrictive power.” The bald man laughed coldly.

The divine soul’s cultivation had to reach a certain level at the very least to probe the power of restriction. Otherwise, one had to have a powerful detection magical artifact to do so.

Even Dao Realm experts who cultivated peak power might not be able to detect the restriction.

There was a powerful soul-cultivating among his teammates, which was why he could discover this location..
