Chapter 1477: Chapter 1,477, a bunch of good-for-nothings! 1

An alchemist who possessed the purple flame held an extraordinary significance, and might even threaten the alchemist King’s position.

He turned to look at su song and asked, “Where is he now?”

“He’s waiting in the room you arranged. This is the prescription he gave me.”Su Song hurriedly took out the prescription and handed it to the alchemist King.

The pill refining king took it and carefully sized it up. However, after looking at it for a long time, he still couldn’t understand what kind of Pill Qin Yu was refining.

“Strange, why have I never seen this prescription before?”The pill refining king frowned.

“Did he say what kind of pill he was refining?”The pill refining king hurriedly looked at Su Song.

Su Song shook his head and said, “No, but... I told him that as long as he refined a divine rank pill, he could choose from all the floors...”

The alchemist King’s face darkened and he berated, “Nonsense!”

Su Song said somewhat awkwardly, “I also didn’t expect that this child can really refine a divine rank pill...”

The alchemist King didn’t speak for a long time. No one knew what he was thinking about.

Su Song said from the side, “Don’t be anxious. He might not succeed at all...”

“Since he has the purple-colored spiritual fire, that means he has a certain level of ability.”The Alchemist king took a deep breath.

After pondering for a moment, he returned the prescription to Su Song.

“Go, give him the lowest quality herbs and think of ways to prevent him from succeeding,”said the alchemy king.

“At the same time, arrange for people to disturb him in the dark and disrupt his divine sense,”said the alchemy king with narrowed eyes.

When refining pills, one had to ensure that one’s mind was highly focused. If one’s divine sense was disrupted, the possibility of failure would be extremely high.

Su Song came to a sudden realization. He hurriedly nodded and said, “Don’t worry, I understand.”

After saying this, Su Song quickly left the place.

He selected a batch of inferior herbs for Qin Yu according to the requirements of the Alchemy King.

Then, he arranged for people to hide in the dark, ready to disturb Qin Yu’s mind at any time to ensure that Qin Yu’s pill refinement failed.

After making the arrangements, Su Song brought the herbs all the way back to his room.

He handed the herbs to Qin Yu and said, “These are the herbs you want. Do you need to prepare anything else?”

Qin Yu took the herbs and glanced at them. A cold smile couldn’t help but appear on the corner of his mouth.

These herbs were all over ten thousand years old.

To Su Song and the others, these were the most inferior herbs that the medicine hall could find.

But to Qin Yu, these were all high-quality herbs!

Herbs that were ten thousand years old could be said to be rare on Earth. They were top-notch herbs!

“Why? Are you deliberately making things difficult for me?”Qin Yu waved the herbs in his hand and said with a faint smile.

Su Song’s face changed and said, “Don’t talk nonsense. All the participants are the same!”

“Oh? Is That So?”Qin Yu sneered.

“Su Song, I can basically see it now,”Qin Yu said indifferently.

Su Song was stunned, and he said somewhat apprehensively, “What did you see?”

“I can see that you guys are all good-for-nothings,”Qin Yu said with a sneer.

“I really didn’t expect that alchemists in the holy region would be so trash. You actually thought that ten-thousand-year-old herbs were trash. Those top-notch herbs are really wasted in your hands.”

Hearing this, Su Song immediately flew into a rage. “Kid, what nonsense are you spouting! Are you looking down on us! ?”

Qin Yu played with the herbs in his hands and said indifferently, “I come from a place where resources are extremely scarce. But even there, we still produced many top-notch Alchemists.”

“They can rely on thousand-year-old or even a few hundred-year-old herbs to refine top-notch pills, but you guys are sitting on these resources and are nothing.”

Qin Yu shook his head repeatedly. These people were simply too inferior compared to the people from the Divine Alchemist Pavilion back then.

Not to mention the pavilion master, even Taozi was much stronger than these people.

“Nonsense,”Su Song said coldly.

Then, he changed the topic and said, “Say it. What else do you need us to prepare?”

“There’s no need. These are enough,”Qin Yu said indifferently.

With that, Qin Yu directly took out the Dragon Cauldron and placed it in front of everyone.

Seeing this cauldron, Su Song couldn’t help but sneer.

“What kind of decent pill can be refined from this kind of cauldron?”Su Song mocked mercilessly.

Qin Yu said indifferently, “That’s right. That’s why I think you guys are a bunch of drunkards.”

“You!”Su Song couldn’t help but tremble from Qin Yu’s anger, but he didn’t know how to reply.

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered to waste his breath on them. He took out the herbs, and with a wave of his palm, the purple spiritual fire landed in his hand. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Then, Qin Yu gently touched his finger, and a wisp of flame the size of a bean began to burn.

Qin Yu held his breath and began to refine the pill.

He put the herbs into the cauldron in order, then closed his eyes slightly and controlled the flame with his mind.

Su Song, who was watching from the side, was confused. He couldn’t tell what kind of Pill Qin Yu was going to refine.

“What kind of pill are you going to refine?”Su Song couldn’t help but Mutter.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. All his mind was focused on refining the pill.

And the pill that Qin Yu was going to refine this time was the nine transformation golden pill!

This kind of pill was top-notch even in the entire cultivation world. With this pill, Qin Yu could even break into the central state, let alone a small medicine sacred hall!

As time passed, Qin Yu’s control over the flames left Su Song dumbstruck.

Such precise control far surpassed that of everyone in the Medicine Sacred Hall!

“This kid is indeed extraordinary.”Su Song thought to himself.

As an alchemist, he couldn’t help but feel some admiration in his heart.

But more than that, he was worried. After all, Qin Yu’s intrusion could very possibly change their structure and disrupt their originally peaceful and carefree lives.

As time passed, a medicinal fragrance exploded in the room.

The extremely rich medicinal liquid was also slowly shrinking.

This was the most important step in pill refinement, the formation!

Su Song narrowed his eyes and couldn’t help but sneer in his heart.

“This brat has some ability. Unfortunately, you will still fail,”Su Song said coldly.

As long as he waited for the final step of Qin Yu’s formation to disrupt his divine sense, then this pill would definitely fail!

Su Song’s eyes stared straight at Qin Yu’s cauldron. At the same time, he watched Qin Yu’s expression change.

At a glance, Qin Yu’s expression was extremely calm. It was as if the refinement of this pill was extremely easy for him.

This made Su Song even more respectful. He even felt a trace of excitement in his heart.

“It’s about time.”

Seeing that Qin Yu’s pill was about to take shape, Su Song’s lips curled up into a cold smile.

The people in the dark began to make their moves at this moment.

A strand of divine sense shot out from the dark and headed straight for Qin Yu’s glabella!

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He could clearly feel that a strand of divine sense was disturbing his mind.
