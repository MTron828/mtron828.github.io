Chapter 435: He Teng of the Central Plains Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Li Zinan was a smart man. Even though Yan Sihai spoke nonchalantly, he felt that this matter wasn’t as simple as it seemed.

Just to capture a person without any cultivation, the Saint Confucian Sect had mobilized five Inner Strength Grandmasters!

This was enough to show that Yan Sihai attached great importance to this matter! And the person who would be captured definitely wasn’t simple!

“Remember, listen to my orders. No one can be careless,” Li Zinan reminded.

“Yes, Elder Li.” Everyone hurriedly nodded.

...

After Qin Yu hung up the phone, he prepared to leave for Sea City.

Qin Yu had heard many rumors about Sea City.

It was said that the economy there was extremely developed, and there were rich people everywhere.

Although it wasn’t as mysterious as Jingdu, it was an international metropolis that attracted countless foreigners.

Just as Qin Yu was about to leave, Uncle Wu’s car suddenly drove in in a hurry.

When the car stopped, he saw Xiao Yu running in somewhat anxiously, while Uncle Wu followed closely behind.

As soon as she saw Qin Yu, Xiao Yu anxiously said, “How are you? Are you okay? I heard that many people want to kill you. Why are you still here?”

Qin Yu was at a loss as to how to answer the questions that were thrown out one after another.

“I’ve made an agreement with my father to let you go to the military district of Chuzhou region. No matter how bold they are, they wouldn’t dare to go to the military district to kill people!” Xiao Yu said as if it was a matter of fact.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “There’s no need for that. I’ll be fine.”

“Qin Yu, what Xiao Yu said makes sense. Commander Long also specifically mentioned this matter to me,” Uncle Wu nodded and said.

Qin Yu looked at Uncle Wu and said politely, “Uncle Wu, there’s really no need for that. I’ll take care of myself.”

At this point, Qin Yu suddenly felt the fluctuation of Xiao Yu’s internal qi, which seemed to be a little strange.

Her body seemed to be tainted with an extremely ancient internal qi.

This internal qi obviously didn’t belong to this era.

Even though it was rather weak, Qin Yu was still able to sense it.

“Xiao Yu, that mask... have you worn it before?” Qin Yu asked.

Xiao Yu nodded and said, “Yes, I have. But... every time I wear it, I feel a little strange.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Strange?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and waited for Xiao Yu to continue.

Xiao Yu said, “I can’t describe that feeling. It’s very strange. Don’t worry about my matters. You should think about what you should do.”

Seeing that he couldn’t refuse, Qin Yu said seriously, “How about this? If anything happens, I’ll tell you immediately and go to the military district. Okay?”

“Who knows when they’ll come?” Xiao Yu muttered.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly.

This little brat was really hard to fool.

“Okay, I’ve found a countermeasure, but this countermeasure must be kept secret for the time being,” Qin Yu could only lie.

Fortunately, Xiao Yu was still relatively simple-minded. She looked at Qin Yu with doubt and asked, “Is what you said true?”

“Of course. Why would I joke about my own life?” Qin Yu said.

“Alright then. If it really doesn’t work, I’ll ask my dad to send a team over for you,” Xiao Yu said in a low voice.

Qin Yu didn’t know how to react. Xiao Yu really had a big imagination.

“Alright, don’t worry about me. I still have some matters to attend to. I have to go out for a while.” Qin Yu waved his hand and said.

“Uncle Wu, I won’t accompany you anymore.”

Uncle Wu nodded and said, “Okay, be careful with everything.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. After he said goodbye to everyone, he left in a hurry.

...

Sea City Airport.

Qin Yu took out his cell phone and called Fang Yue. He said, “I’ve already arrived at Sea City.”

It was already evening. Fang Yue said on the phone, “I’ll wait for you at No. 1 restaurant.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He immediately took a taxi and rushed to No. 1 restaurant.

In the restaurant, Fang Yue was sitting in an inconspicuous position, but there were still a lot of people around her.

“Miss, can you give me your contact number?”

“I’d like to buy you a drink. I wonder if you’re free?”

There were even some who went straight to the point. “I have ten properties under my name, five luxury cars, and eight-figure savings. Let’s have a chat?”

Fang Yue was obviously used to being hit on by everyone.

However, Fang Yue would never agree to a chat, much less reject it. She always maintained an ambivalent stance.

After seeing Qin Yu, Fang Yue smiled and said, “I’m sorry, my friend is here.”

Everyone turned to look at Qin Yu. Although they were a little unhappy, they tactfully walked away.

After sitting down, Qin Yu said jokingly, “Miss Fang seems to like the feeling of being adored.”

Fang Yue spread her hands and said, “Who doesn’t want to be popular?”

Qin Yu said half-jokingly and half-seriously, “I’m afraid your boyfriend will have a hard time in the future.”

At this point, Qin Yu suddenly realized that Fang Yue had unknowingly stepped into the realm of an Inner Strength Grandmaster.

“Is it very strange?” Before Qin Yu could ask, Fang Yue said with a smile.

Only then did Qin Yu remember that Fang Yue could read other people’s minds.

“That’s not it.” Qin Yu shook his head and then said seriously, “Miss Fang, why did you suddenly come to Sea City?”

Fang Yue didn’t hide anything. She smiled and said, “There’s an extravagent cruise ship going to Brightheart Island tomorrow. I can’t miss this opportunity.”

“Brightheart Island? Is it for tourism?” Qin Yu asked.

“For them, it’s for tourism, but not for me,” Fang Yue said indifferently.

Qin Yu said with some confusion, “Could it be... that there’s some treasure on Brightheart Island?”

Fang Yue pointed at Qin Yu’s dantian and said with a smile, “The inner core that you ate was obtained on Brightheart Island.”

Qin Yu was shocked.

The effect of the demonic beast inner core was beyond imagination!

It wasn’t inferior to top-grade herbs!

“What conditions do you need to go to Brightheart Island?” Qin Yu hurriedly asked.

“An invitation letter,” Fang Yue said.

After saying that, Fang Yue spread out her palms, and the two invitation letters fell into her hands.

Qin Yu subconsciously wanted to reach out for the invitation letter, but Fang Yue retracted her hand at this time.

She said with slight regret, “Mr. Qin, I’m very sorry. This invitation letter has already been given to someone else.”

“Given to who?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Fang Yue nodded and said, “He Teng.”

“He Teng? He Teng of the Central Plains?” Qin Yu’s expression was a little unsightly.

He Teng had always been the number one person on Pyro’s martial arts potential rankings.

Even when Qin Yu was at his peak, he had still been firmly suppressed by him on the rankings.

“Looks like I’m not the only one that Miss Fang is working with.” Qin Yu retracted his hand and said with a smile.
