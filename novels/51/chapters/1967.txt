1968 The Yao Family Making a Move

Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel shocked.

In this case, Xiao Yu was definitely involved.

“Mr. Qin, what’s the matter?” the prince noticed Qin Yu’s abnormality and could not help but ask.

“Nothing,” Qin Yu said, waving his hand. “It’s just that the name ‘Satan’ is taboo in my former place. Thus it sounds rather weird.”

!!

The prince laughed and said, “I see. Mr. Qin, you don’t have to worry. After all, ordinary people won’t encounter such an organization.”

“Yeah, but I’ve encountered all that are not supposed to!” Qin Yu cursed in his heart.

However, what was done was done, and there was no use in saying anything.

“Mr. Qin, I believe the Si family will arrive in Sky City in a few days. When the time comes, I will set up a trap and invite you all to discuss this matter. I hope Mr. Qin will not be too stingy then,” the prince said.

“Don’t worry,” Qin Yu got up and said.

The prince didn’t stay any longer and immediately turned to leave.

After he left, Jue Wu came forward and said, “The Prince of Great Xia looks so sick as if he has contracted some kind of terminal illness.”

“Yes,” Qin Yu answered casually.

After that, Qin Yu took out the pills Jue Wu had brought back and swallowed them all into his stomach to begin the absorption.

…

Sky City wasn’t big but had all the essentials.

This place used to be privately owned by the Great Xia Royal Family. After the decline of the family, it turned into a city and was in the center of Zhongzhou.

Walking on the streets of Sky City, one could see top-notch experts everywhere. Even Semi-Saints were commonly seen.

“So this is Sky City? Speaking of which, this is my first time here. It doesn’t look that great,” a young cultivator in the central street of Sky City muttered.

A masked woman beside him shouted, “Don’t talk nonsense.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The young cultivator stuck out his tongue and said, “Young Lady, why are we here? Are you really here to have fun?”

The masked woman was silent for a while and then said, “Don’t ask further. I’ll tell you what I should be telling you.”

After saying that, the masked woman took the lead and walked forward hurriedly.

The following day, the prince arrived as promised. He brought an alchemist to treat Qin Yu.

This alchemist had a head full of gray hair. Although his internal qi wasn’t strong, he was full of essence qi, just like a young man.

“Mr. Qin, this is Sky City’s number one alchemist, Master Yun,” the prince introduced.

“Nice to meet you, Master Yun,” Qin Yu quickly cupped his hands and said.

Master Yun nodded slightly. He didn’t say a thing but just raised his palm and placed it on Qin Yu’s forehead.

After a while, Master Yun frowned and said, “You’re also an alchemist?”

“Considered one,” Qin Yu said humbly.

Master Yun narrowed his eyes and said in a low voice, “Considered one? You’re being too humble. To have such terrifying mental strength under such a weak state, you must be a top-notch alchemist.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but be surprised.

This Master Yun wasn’t simple. He had only raised his hand, and he had seen through everything.

“If you have something you can’t tell me, I won’t ask,” Master Yun said. Then, he took out his medicine cauldron and prepared to refine medicine for Qin Yu.

“I’m indeed an alchemist, but I’m indeed not worth mentioning,” Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

Master Yun didn’t say anything as if he was lazy to talk to Qin Yu.

Seeing this, Qin Yu could only stand aside and watch Master Yun refine the medicine.

Master Yun’s standard in alchemy was tremendously high. He even had the blue spiritual fire. Even Qin Yu was dumbfounded by his skill.

In a short while, Master Yun had already refined five pills.

“Take these pills, one a day. You’ll be fine in five days,” Master Yun said casually.

“Master Yun’s alchemy skills have broadened my horizons,” Qin Yu sighed and said.

“Master Yun is a seventh-grade alchemist,” the prince said with a smile. “There’s no need to elaborate on his skills.”

This was the first time Qin Yu had heard of a seventh-grade alchemist.

“Your Highness, you don’t have to praise me. This young man’s level is not worse than mine,” Master Yun said indifferently.

“Master Yun, you’ve thought too highly of me,” Qin Yu said with a bitter smile. “If I had that level of skills, I wouldn’t have come to you.”

Master Yun opened his mouth and was about to speak when several internal qi suddenly approached him rapidly!

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly. He quickly got up and looked coldly in the direction of the internal qi.

In a short while, three elderly men appeared outside the door.

These three elderly men were wearing long hemp robes, and their eyes were deep like the abyss, causing fear to people.

“Prince of the Great Xia,” the three elderly men looked at the prince and greeted him.

“May I know who you are?” the prince asked, surprised.

“We’re from the Yao family, and we’re here for Qin Yu,” one of the elderly men said coldly.

The prince couldn’t help but be stunned. He looked at Qin Yu in surprise as if he was asking him something with his eyes.

“What’s the matter?” Qin Yu took stepped forward and asked. “Just tell me directly.”

One of the elderly men snorted and said, “Qin Yu, the Yao family had invited you out of goodwill. Not only did you reject us, but you also killed many of our people. How should you be punished?”

Seeing this, Qin Yu sneered and said, “Invitation out of goodwill? You tried in vain to send me to the Si family and even tried to imprison me, and now you claimed to have invited me out of goodwill? You’re really shameless!”

“Nonsense,” one of the elderly men said coldly. “Cut the crap and follow us.”

“Follow your a*s! Try taking a step closer!” Jue Wu rushed out of the room with a “whoosh” and glared at the three people.

The three elderly men looked at Jue Wu and whispered, “She’s less than five feet tall. I think she’s the one who did it.”

“You’re not tall, but you have a big temper,” another elderly man said coldly.

“F*ck you! I’m going to break your legs and see who’s taller!” Jue Wu was furious and about to attack.

Qin Yu quickly stopped Jue Wu and shook his head, “Don’t make any move. This is Sky City.”

At this moment, Qin Yu looked at the elderly men, smiled, and said. “Sam for you. You can’t do anything to me in Sky City.”

“That’s right. We know you’re hiding in Sky City, trying to take refuge here. Thus we came fully prepared,” an elderly man said.

The elderly man beside him took out a magical artifact that emitted a mysterious glow.

The prince’s expression slightly changed when he saw the magical artifact.

“Your Highness, we can forcefully open the space and bring Qin Yu into it. This way, he won’t be considered being in Sky City, right? ” that old man said indifferently.
