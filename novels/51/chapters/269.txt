Chapter 270: One Sword Slash! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The thing that wrapped around Qin Yu was precisely the Spiritual Fire!

The Spiritual Fire was an item of extreme light, the nemesis of parasites!

All the parasites evaded several meters under the threat of the Spiritual Fire!

Qin Yu flicked his finger, and another wisp of Spiritual Fire landed on Jiang Gu’s body.

In an instant, crackling sounds like fried beans came from Jiang Gu’s body.

Jiang Gu hurriedly got up from the ground. He looked at his body with lingering fear and couldn’t help but break out in cold sweat.

These parasites were too terrifying!

No wonder everyone was unwilling to go deep into the southwest, and even more unwilling to go deep into the Earth Fiend Valley!

“Thank you, Mr. Qin.” Jiang gu cupped his hands towards Qin Yu.

Qin Yu didn’t speak, but looked around coldly.

Although these parasites didn’t dare to move forward, they didn’t disperse either.

They surrounded Qin Yu and Jiang Gu and didn’t allow them to move forward.

“Spiritual Fire?” The old man’s voice came from the dark.

“Blue Spiritual Fire?” There was a hint of greed in his voice.

Updates by

It was obvious that even in the Earth Fiend Valley, Blue Spiritual Fire was very precious!

Qin Yu didn’t say anything, but raised his hand and threw a ball of Spiritual Fire forward.

In an instant, countless parasites turned into corpses under the burning Spiritual Fire.

The old man in the dark rebuked coldly, “The energy consumption of the Spiritual Fire is huge. I want to see how long you can last!”

As he said that, the number of parasites surrounding them increased by several times!

“Rise!”

Then, the old man in the dark roared again and again!

Countless parasites flew into the sky.

The parasites that blotted out the sky turned this valley into pitch black!

And these parasites that were mixed with dark energy actually transformed into a huge human figure in the sky!

The pitch black giant was at least the level of a three-story building!

The overwhelming dark energy made people break out in cold sweat!

“Hahaha! I’d like to see how long your Spiritual Fire can last!” The old man laughed coldly.

Qin Yu didn’t say a word. He held the Spiritual Fire in his hand and took a step forward before approaching the giant!

“Chi la!”

Qin Yu’s fist that was wrapped in the Spiritual Fire was like a blade, tearing the parasites apart!

When his fist landed, at least thousands of parasites died!

But what shocked Qin Yu was that soon, more parasites made up for it!

“Huh?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

How many parasites were there in the Earth Fiend Valley?

“Hehe, I really want to know how long you can last.” The old man said coldly. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Unfortunately, I don’t have time to accompany you, so you’d better die quickly!”

The old man roared angrily. He urged this giant to move toward Qin Yu!

Qin Yu hurriedly wrapped his body in Spiritual Fire, clenched his golden fist, and met it head-on!

“Chi la!”

Another group of parasites were torn apart! However, Qin Yu’s body also suffered a heavy blow!

These parasites contained a terrifying poisonous gas that made Qin Yu’s vision go black!

“If this continues, I’m afraid my spiritual power will really be exhausted.” Qin Yu thought inside.

There were countless parasites here, so fighting a battle of attrition was definitely not a wise choice.

“The Earth Fiend Valley really likes to use attrition.” Qin Yu sneered.

Hui Ming did so back then, and now, after they had entered into the depths of the Earth Fiend Valley, they still encountered such a situation.

“Hahaha! So what?” The old man’s voice came from all directions.

Qin Yu’s lips curled into a cold smile, and the blue flame on his body slowly disappeared until it was completely extinguished.

“What, you gave up?” The old man sneered.

“Then come and be the parasite’s fodder!”

After a furious roar, the giant charged at Qin Yu again!

A huge hand came crashing down and it almost shattered the entire canyon!

“Go to h*ll!” The old man roared crazily!

This huge hand ruthlessly descended!

The entire ground instantly caved in!

Smoke and dust rose up and obscured one’s vision. Rocks rolled down, as if a huge collision had occurred.

The old man’s figure finally appeared.

He stood at a vantage point in the canyon while coldly looking in the direction of the explosion.

“You reckless thing,” the old man said coldly.

Just as he turned around and was about to leave, a golden light suddenly cut through the smoke and darkness! It lit up the entire canyon!

“Crash!”

The sword went straight for the giant! The sharp sword actually split the giant in half!

The old man’s expression suddenly changed and he exclaimed, “How is this possible?!”

A figure jumped out from the rubble.

In his hand was a long sword that was stained with golden light.

This sword was the bronze sword that Qin Yu had obtained at the auction!

The bronze sword contained pure spiritual energy, and it was the nemesis of the Earth Fiend Valley!

“Do you really think I can’t do anything about it?” Qin Yu sneered.

The old man’s expression was a little ugly. He silently recited an incantation once again and activated a spell to condense the giant again.

However, before the giant could take form, Qin Yu’s sword had already chopped off its head!

“If you condense once, I will slash once. If you condense ten times, I will slash ten times!” Qin Yu’s voice was ice-cold!

The old man was a little flustered. As he retreated, he said in a trembling voice, “No... No, I will bring you to the Earth Fiend Valley now. Don’t kill me!”

Qin Yu’s feet shook, and in the blink of an eye, he arrived in front of the old man.

Then, Qin Yu held the bronze sword in his hand and slashed out with a sharp sword.

“Chi La!”

This sword actually cut the old man into two halves from his waist!

“Ah!!!”

This kind of pain was unimaginable, and the old man almost fainted from the pain!

Qin Yu stretched out his palm, and a stream of spiritual energy protected the old man’s wound.

“Don’t worry, I won’t kill you. I still need you to lead the way for me...” Qin Yu said with a smile.

...

In the Earth Fiend Valley’s dungeon.

This place was divided into two dungeons. In addition to the imprisoned young girls, there was also a group of imprisoned martial artists.

The young girls were used to absorb dark energy, while the martial artists would be turned into puppets.

At this moment, Xiao Yu was staying in this dungeon.

She raised her head to look at the last bit of light, and her eyes couldn’t help but well up with tears.

“Dad, I miss you so much... I shouldn’t have been so willful...” At this moment, Xiao Yu suddenly remembered her usual unruly behavior.

“If I can get out, I will definitely listen to you...” the more Xiao Yu thought about it, the more upset she became, and tears couldn’t help but flow out.

Beside her, Xiao Mi was even more depressed, and she fainted many times.

“Qin Yu, when will you come and save me...” Qin Yu’s figure kept flashing in Xiao Yu’s mind.

However, so much time had passed, but Qin Yu still didn’t show up.

Perhaps, she was really going to die here.

At this moment, the door of the dungeon opened.

Then, two old men in black robes walked in.

Fear flashed in the eyes of the girls. Afraid that the two old men would see them, they curled up in a corner.

The two old men glanced at each other, then their eyes fell on Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi.
