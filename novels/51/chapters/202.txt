Chapter 203: Yao Qing? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Faced with Jiang Gu’s arrogance, Mr. Wu couldn’t do anything.

He couldn’t make things difficult for the Jiang family, and the Martial Arts Association wouldn’t give in either.

For a moment, Mr. Wu’s face was full of worry.

The next day, Qin Yu was still locked in this narrow room.

But he could feel that he wasn’t the only one locked in here.

“Looks like a lot of martial artists are locked up here.” Qin Yu muttered softly.

He couldn’t help but feel a little worried.

What if the Jiang family was really determined to have the Martial Arts Association get rid of him? What should he do?

“Escape?” Qin Yu frowned.

If he escaped, he would probably never be able to return to Pyro in the future, so how could he go to Jingdu and marry Yan Ruoxue?

But if he were to not escape and die here, then everything would be in vain.

At that moment, the sound of footsteps suddenly sounded from outside.

Not long after, a ray of light lit up.

A few people stood at the door.

And the one leading them was Yuan Hong, and Jiang Gu’s butler, Mr. Zhong.

When he saw the two of them, Qin Yu’s expression immediately turned icy cold.

Mr. Zhong walked forward and stood outside the prison. He sneered and said, “Qin Yu, so what if you win against him? Aren’t you still a prisoner?”

Qin Yu said coldly, “Jiang Gu really has quite some backbone. Is he really the number one person in Chuzhou? Is that all he has?”

Mr. Zhong laughed and said, “The winner takes all! As long as you succeed, who will remember your methods?”

Qin Yu suddenly stood up and glared at Mr. Zhong. “If I knew this would happen, I would have killed Jiang Gu!”

“Hehe, you won’t have the chance,” Mr. Zhong sneered.

He leaned against the side of the cage and said gloomily, “Let me tell you, after you die, all the people who depend on you will be tortured by the Jiang family!”

“I will make your friends and relatives beg for death!” Mr. Zhong said viciously.

When he heard this, Qin Yu was furious!

He suddenly released his spiritual energy and smacked Mr. Zhong’s chest!

Mr. Zhong was sent flying!

If an ordinary person was hit by his palm, they would definitely die!

However, Mr. Zhong was an Inner Strength Past Master after all. Even though his cultivation base was ruined, his body was still an Inner Strength Past Master.

Therefore, he only spat out a mouthful of blood!

“Qin Yu, you really don’t know what’s good for you!” Mr. Zhong wiped the blood off his mouth.

He turned to look at Yuan Hong and said, “President Yuan, transfer him to the public room.”

Yuan Hong smiled and said, “No problem.”

After saying that, he waved his hand and two Inner Strength Past Masters walked in from outside the door.

“Transfer the criminal Qin Yu to the public room,” Yuan Hong said.

“Yes.”

The two of them brought Qin Yu to the dark depths.

“Qin Yu, let me tell you. Your documents will be ready soon. At that time, you will die for sure!” Mr. Zhong’s voice came from behind.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He clenched his fists, and the anger almost devoured him!

“Get in!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

They went all the way to the public room.

The public room was very large. Rather than calling it a cage, it was more like an abandoned wasteland.

There were no beds here. Everyone was sleeping on the ground.

At a glance, there were at least dozens of martial artists in the public room!

And the strongest one almost reached the realm of an Inner Strength Past Master!

“This Martial Arts Association is really quite shady.” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

He found a random place to sit down, then closed his eyes and began to meditate.

Qin Yu’s mind raced. He thought of countless methods, but none of them worked.

“Do I really have to die here...” Despair flashed across Qin Yu’s face.

His state of mind became increasingly unstable, as if he was going to explode at any moment!

“No, no, I definitely can’t die here!” Qin Yu gritted his teeth, and his entire body emitted waves of light!

He stood up and looked at the exit of the cage while the energy in his body suddenly burst out!

“Kid, I advise you to give up this idea.”

At this moment, someone beside him suddenly reminded him.

“Although the Martial Arts Association is a non-governmental organization, it has an extraordinary position in the hearts of all the martial artists in the world. If you forcefully break out of the cage, then you will be the enemy of the whole world,” the person continued to say.

Qin Yu’s brows immediately furrowed.

It was very obvious that the Martial Arts Association was an official organization in the hearts of the martial artists.

No one was willing to offend them.

Qin Yu’s internal qi began to stabilize.

He took a deep breath and muttered in a low voice, “Maybe there’s still a chance. Mr. Wu and the others will definitely think of a way.”

Thinking of this, Qin Yu withdrew his internal qi and sat down again.

At this moment, a commotion suddenly came from not too far away.

“Kneel down before me!”

After turning around, he saw four to five martial artists surrounding a young man.

These four to five people were all at the Inner Strength Past Master realm, and their strength was extraordinary!

As for the young man who was surrounded, his strength was insignificant.

“Don’t even think about it! Even if I die, I won’t submit to you!” The young man roared furiously.

Originally, Qin Yu didn’t care about this kind of thing at all, but this young man’s voice was somewhat familiar to Qin Yu.

He opened his eyes and looked in the direction of the voice.

He saw that the young man who was surrounded was actually Yao Qing!

“Why is Yao Qing here?” Qin Yu’s expression changed, and he immediately stood up and walked towards Yao Qing’s direction.

A few martial artists raised their hands and pressed on Yao Qing’s shoulders.

“You’re not going to kneel, right? Then we’ll break your legs and make you kneel for the rest of your life!” The leading brawny man shouted angrily.

Yao Qing’s forehead dripped with a trace of sweat, but even so, he still forcefully held on.

“You’re too big for your britches.” The brawny man snorted coldly.

He raised his rough palm towards Yao Qing!

Just as this palm was about to land on Yao Qing’s body, a delicate and pretty palm grabbed his wrist.

The brawny man frowned slightly and shouted angrily, “Who dares to meddle in my business?!”

“Your father!” Qin Yu said coldly.

In the next second, Qin Yu exerted force with his palm and crushed the brawny man’s wrist!

“Ah!!”

The intense pain made the Brawny man roar crazily!

The people around him were even more furious and rushed towards Qin Yu!

However, in front of Qin Yu, these Inner Strength Past Masters weren’t worth mentioning.

Qin Yu was extremely ruthless. With every punch, someone’s arm and leg would be broken!

In just a few minutes, these four to five Inner Strength Past Masters were all wounded!

“Mr. Qin? You... why are you here?” Yao Qing said with a stunned expression.

Qin Yu patted Yao Qing’s shoulder. Then, he swept his gaze across the crowd and said coldly, “You like to make people kneel down so much?”

“Kid, mind your own business...” someone gritted his teeth and said.

Qin Yu glanced at him and then stretched out his big hand. Like swatting a fly, he smacked him to the ground!

“You like to make people kneel down, right? Then I’ll let you all have a taste of kneeling on the ground,” Qin Yu said coldly.

In the next second, Qin Yu went away.

In just a few short seconds, the knees of these Inner Strength Past Masters were all shattered!
