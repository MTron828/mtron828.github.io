Chapter 462: I’ll Show You! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Master, don’t you think too highly of Qin Yu?” The young man was obviously very displeased.

The old man smiled and didn’t say anything else.

This old man was none other than Jiang He, who was as famous as Ye Qing.

In the crowd, his internal qi was extremely subdued. No one would look at him anymore. He was truly a low-key big shot.

Not far away, the crowd slowly retreated, leaving space for Qin Yu and He Teng.

The number one and the number two on the potential ranking list had finally met.

This battle was even rated as the battle of the century by the Martial Arts Forum.

He Teng stood on the shore of the Yiyang Lake with his hands behind his back while quietly waiting for Qin Yu.

His eyes were closed, and his internal qi was restrained.

On the other hand, Qin Yu took two steps at a time. His face had a trace of coldness, as if there was some kind of feud between the two of them.

Soon, Qin Yu walked in front of He Teng.

The internal qi on his body was released. Streams of murderous internal qi came from all directions and directly approached He Teng!

He Teng’s eyes suddenly opened!

He looked at Qin Yu and said indifferently, “You really dared to come.”

Qin Yu went straight to the point, “Before we fight, let me ask you a question.”

“Huh?” He Teng raised his eyebrows.

Qin Yu said coldly, “What’s going on with Fang Yue? Why is she unconscious? What spell did you use?”

He Teng couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

Then, he looked at Qin Yu with a bit of amusement and said, “She’s just a b*tch. Why do you care so much?”

Qin Yu was not in the mood to listen to his nonsense. He frowned and said, “Tell me, what is going on?”

He Teng said indifferently, “Aren’t you an Elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion? Why do you have to ask me?”

“If you want to say it, then say it. If you don’t want to say it, then shut up. Why do you have to nag like a woman?” Qin Yu said impatiently.

He Teng’s expression darkened. He snorted coldly and said, “You can’t even protect yourself. You’re still in the mood to meddle in other people’s business?”

“Moreover, what obligation do I have to tell you?”

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Okay, then I’ll ask you after I cripple you.”

“Hahahaha!” He Teng immediately raised his head and laughed loudly.

“Qin Yu, you’re overestimating yourself too much! Do you know how big the gap is between a half-step Martial Marquis and an Inner Strength Grandmaster?!”

“Moreover, you’ve only just become an Inner Strength Grandmaster!”

Qin Yu stretched lazily and said with a aloof smile, “It’s enough time. How do you know that I haven’t improved?”

He Teng sneered. “It’s only been half a month since we last parted. Even if you’re the chosen one, how much can you improve in such a short time?”

A trace of slyness flashed across Qin Yu’s face.

For some reason, this trace of slyness made He Teng feel a little uneasy.

“You were able to step into the half-step Martial Marquis realm in such a short time, so why can’t I improve?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said.

He Teng snickered. “That’s because I have my own secret technique!”

“Secret technique?” Qin Yu grinned.

“Are you referring to the tower in Dongchuan?” Qin Yu asked with a smile.

He Teng’s expression immediately changed! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

His pupils suddenly constricted, and the internal qi on his body also fluctuated violently at this moment!

“You... you have entered the Water Rhyme Tower?” He Teng’s expression was extremely ugly!

Qin Yu suddenly came to a realization and said, “Oh, so that tower is called the Water Rhyme Tower. What a good name.”

“Impossible! The Water Rhyme Tower has a restrictive power set up. Without my permission, no one can step into it!” He Teng said coldly.

Qin Yu smiled aloofly and said, “Restrictive power? I smashed it into pieces with just three punches. The restrictive power you set up is child’s play.”

He Teng’s expression became increasingly gloomy.

But even so, He Teng was still unwilling to believe it.

“You’re bluffing. Do you think I’ll believe it?” He Teng snorted coldly.

“You don’t believe me?” Qin Yu nodded.

“Alright then, I will let you see what kind of changes I have had in the past half a month...”

As soon as he finished speaking, Qin Yu’s internal qi began to climb rapidly!

Terrifying spiritual power filled Qin Yu’s chest!

As his internal qi increased, the entire ground began to tremble!

The shore of the lake rippled from the violent waves!

Rumble..

The ground began to shake, and the air began to surge. Tornadoes appeared, as if it was the end of the world!

“What... What’s going on?”

“An earthquake is coming?”

Countless ordinary people were so frightened that their faces turned pale as they fled!

The martial artists watching the battle in the dark were even more shocked!

“What... what a powerful internal qi!”

“This is definitely not an internal qi that an ordinary Inner Strength Grandmaster can possess!”

“What a powerful internal qi... and this internal qi is still rising!”
