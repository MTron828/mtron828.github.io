Chapter 1578: Chapter 1,578, elder Bai’s heartfelt words 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The deputy sect master’s internal Qi quickly became chaotic. Blood began to ooze out of his body, and cracking sounds came from his bones!

At this moment, the deputy sect master’s expression was extremely painful, and his entire face was almost distorted!

The people around him immediately panicked, and elder Bai’s expression was extremely ugly!

“What... What’s going on?”Di Zun hurriedly looked at the old man.

A trace of panic flashed across the Old Man’s face. He braced himself and said, “It... it should be fine. I think it’ll be fine in a while...”

“I’m afraid it’ll be cold in a while,”Qin Yu mocked.

“As an alchemist, don’t you know the effect of the invisible blood coagulation pill? It can only protect the lives of the injured for a short time, but if he doesn’t receive timely treatment, his body will fester and die,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“You Bastard, how dare you harm our vice sect leader!”

The surrounding elders immediately moved forward and surrounded him.

It was unknown who waved his hand and sent the old man flying!

“Master, Hurry Up and save the vice sect leader, or else he...”Di Zun looked at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Don’t worry, I know what to do.”

With that, he walked up to the deputy sect master and stuffed the pill into his mouth.

......

The moment the pill entered his stomach, the deputy sect master, whose body was festering, gradually calmed down.

Then, Qin Yu raised his palm again and used spiritual Qi to seal a few of the deputy sect master’s vital gates.

After a series of movements, the deputy sect master’s condition finally improved a lot.

Elder Bai, who was hiding at the side, was extremely flustered at this moment. He gritted his teeth and immediately planned to escape.

But at this moment, elder Bai suddenly realized that his body could not move! The surrounding space seemed to have distorted and sealed him up!

“Elder Bai, where do you plan to go?”Qin Yu’s icy cold voice entered his ears.

Elder Bai was flustered, but he still braced himself and said, “I’m planning to get some medicine for the deputy sect master. What’s Wrong?”

Qin Yu sneered, “What? Have you forgotten what you said?”

“I...”Elder Bai opened his mouth and was speechless for a moment.

He was extremely regretful in his heart. If he had known earlier that he would let Qin Yu off, he would not have ended up like this!

“Qin Yu, this is the Heavenly Cloud sect! Are you planning to kill an elder in the Heavenly Cloud Sect? !”Elder Bai shouted.

Qin Yu looked at elder Bai coldly and said, “Let me tell you, no one can save you today.”

As he spoke, the surrounding space began to collapse. A powerful pressure was approaching!

Elder Bai finally panicked. He looked anxiously at the people around him with a pleading look in his eyes.

But at this moment, no one spoke up for him because they knew clearly in their hearts that Qin Yu and elder Bai had a long-standing grudge. Today, no one could stop Qin Yu.

Even the first elder had died in Qin Yu’s hands, let alone elder Bai?

As the pressure around him increased, elder Bai’s body began to compress.

His bones were broken inch by inch, and his flesh and blood were twisted. He looked terrible.

“Qin Yu, don’t kill me!”Elder Bai finally panicked.

He shouted desperately, “As long as you don’t kill me, I’ll do anything you want! I promise I won’t dare to go against you in the future...”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows, and he suddenly stopped what he was doing.

Everyone was shocked. Could it be that Qin Yu was really going to let him go?

“Let me ask you a question.”Qin Yu looked at the panicked elder Bai, he said indifferently, “Let me ask you, why did the son of the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect suddenly leave the Heavenly Cloud sect and accurately find me to provoke me?”

Elder Bai opened his mouth and immediately became flustered.

He knew very well that if he told the truth, the elders would not let him go!

“Why? Aren’t you going to tell me?”Qin Yu sneered.

Elder Bai braced himself and said, “I don’t know what you’re talking about!”

Qin Yu sneered, “I want you to die. There are many ways to do it. I can make you feel better, or I can make you die in pain.”

Hearing this, elder Bai suddenly shivered.

“You... What are you doing?”Elder Bai looked at Qin Yu in horror.

Qin Yu walked up to elder Bai, raised his finger, and gently tapped the space between elder Bai’s eyebrows.

At this moment, elder Bai’s face immediately contorted, and cold sweat flowed down!

His primordial spirit seemed to have been pierced by ten thousand needles, and he was in endless pain!

The entire hall echoed with elder Bai’s painful wails!

“Let’s see how long you can last,”Qin Yu said coldly.

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and was about to leave.

“Don’t... Don’t... I’ll say it...”

Before Qin Yu could walk out of the door, elder Bai’s anguished voice came from behind him.

“You really don’t have any backbone.”Qin Yu’s tone was somewhat mocking.

At this moment, elder Bai’s face was deathly pale, and his head was covered in sweat.

The torture of the primordial spirit made him feel so much pain that he wished he could die. He even wanted to die wholeheartedly!

“Speak.”Qin Yu’s mind moved, and elder Bai’s expression immediately eased up a little.

He looked fiercely at Qin Yu and said, “That’s right. Back then, I was the one who urged young sect master to look for you! I know very well that if sect master forgives you, then the Heavenly Cloud sect will definitely push me out as a shield! At that time, I will definitely die!”

“With your personality, if Young sect master provokes you, you will definitely make a move against him! It’s just that you overestimated his ability, and didn’t expect that one palm strike would kill him!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Hahahaha! If that’s the case, the sect master will definitely not let you off! However, I didn’t expect that... The sect master would actually let go of the grudge of killing his son and let you live until today!”

The surrounding people were dumbstruck when they heard this. On the other hand, Qin Yu was rather calm.

This was not much different from Qin Yu’s guess. The instigator of everything was indeed this elder Bai.

“Elder Bai! You Beast, if it wasn’t for you, the Heavenly Cloud sect wouldn’t be in this state today!”

“In order to take revenge for your own personal grudge, you actually caused the death of the young sect master, you piece of shit!”

Elder Bai gritted his teeth and said, “I just wanted to live. What’s wrong with me! In this world, it’s either him or me! There’s no right or wrong!”

“Don’t pretend to be good people. Things haven’t fallen on your heads yet. Of course, you can stand there and speak without any pain!”

After saying that, elder Bai swept his gaze across the people present. He shouted furiously with all his might, “I know you look down on me for relying on my bootlicking, but is that what I’m willing to do! ?”

“You are born with talent that surpasses ordinary people and enjoy resources that ordinary people can’t compare to. Of course, you can live the life you want by relying on your strength!”

“What about me? I’m just a mortal. I’m just a mortal who doesn’t want to be ordinary! This is my only choice!”

Qin Yu opened his mouth, but he couldn’t find any words to refute.

He didn’t expect that elder Bai would actually say such a moving thing.

“It wasn’t my fault to begin with. It was just this world!”Elder Bai roared. He raised his palm and slapped it on his head!
