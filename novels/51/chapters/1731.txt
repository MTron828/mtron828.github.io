Qin Yu struggled with all his might, trying to stop the nest, but the chains on his body made him unable to move.

No one knew what material the chains were made of or what secret technique was used on them. No matter how hard Qin Yu struggled, he could not move them.

Soon, Chao Cang grabbed the jade pendant and pulled it hard, holding it in his hand.

“Chao Cang. Put it down!” Qin Yu gritted his teeth and glared at Chao Cang.

While Chao Cang ignored him and fiddled with the jade pendant, scrutinizing it.

“It doesn’t seem to be anything good.” He frowned.

He squinted his eyes and looked at Qin Yu before he said with a faint smile, “Could it be that this thing has some special significance?”

Qin Yu glared at him, gritted his teeth, and said, “I can give you other dharma treasures if you return it to me!”

“Oh? Other treasures? Do you have any other treasures?” Chao Cang sneered.

Qin Yu opened his mouth and said in a hurry, “I have many secret treasures on me. If you return the pendant to me, I can give them all to you!”

“Do you think I’m an idiot? I’m afraid all your things are in this Spatial Magic Artifact, right?” Chao Cang snickered.

At this moment, Qin Yu was furious. He opened his mouth and cursed, “Chao Cang, you’d better return the thing to me, or you’ll face a disaster!”

“Hahahahahahaha!”

As soon as Chao Cang heard it, he couldn’t help but laugh.

“Since you care so much about it,” he said with a cold expression, “I’ll destroy it myself. I’d like to see what you can do to me!”

Qin Yu’s expression changed abruptly, and he hurriedly shouted, “Don’t!”

But unfortunately, it was too late.

Chao Cang held the jade pendant and suddenly exerted force, instantly crushing the jade pendant into pieces.

Looking at the shattered jade pendant, Qin Yu’s face turned white with rage.

Chao Cang, on the other hand, was sneering. He clasped his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Brat, you don’t have many days left to live. Cherish it.”

After saying this, the two Chao brothers turned and left.

At the same time, in the Yan family’s grotto-heaven in Zhongzhou, a young girl who was cultivating suddenly opened her eyes.

Her skin was fair and beautiful, as if she had walked out of a painting. The gauze clothes on her body and the little embellishment between her eyebrows indicated her unique identity.

This person was none other than Yan Ruoxue.

The moment the jade pendant was crushed, she was jolted awake.

Qin Yu’s location quickly appeared in her mind.

“Qin Yu… is in danger.” Her brows furrowed slightly. She didn’t waste any time and immediately stood up and left.

In Xihuang.

The two brothers of the Chao family were searching for the dharma treasures in Qin Yu’s Spatial Magic Artifact.

Unfortunately, the artifact had long been bound to Qin Yu, so they could not enter it.

“Motherf**ker!”

Chao Cang was flustered and exasperated. He threw the artifact to the side.

“There’s no need to be angry.” Chao Shou said indifferently, “I’m afraid he doesn’t have anything valuable.”

Although Chao Cang was a little unwilling, he could only nod.

“Sect Master, why do we have to leave three days later?” Chao Cang changed the topic.

“What’s wrong? Can’t wait?” Chao Shou raised his eyebrows.

Chao Cang nodded and said with a cold face, “I can’t wait to see Xiao Sheng’s face when he begs for mercy.”

“Hahahahaha!” Chao Shou raised his head to the sky and laughed.

“I’m afraid you won’t see him beg for mercy, but it won’t be a problem to see his reputation ruined.” Chao Shou said indifferently.

“I will use these three days to create enough panic and inform the entire Nanzhou of the terror of the Chao family!” Chao Shou sneered.

He flipped his palm and took out the mysterious pearl.

“During this period, I will continue to create panic in Nanzhou and destroy their psychological defense in one fell swoop,” Chao Shou said coldly.

The following day.

The scene of Qin Yu being tortured was projected in the sky of Nanzhou.

The powerful methods of the two Chao brothers left the entire Nanzhou panicking.

“Qin Yu has also fallen into their hands. No wonder we haven’t seen any trace of him for so long.”

“There’s Yong Ji before him, unable to fight back. And then there’s Qin Yu, tormented to the point of wishing he was dead. This Chao Cang seems to be even more terrifying than Yuan Xiu.”

“It’s all over…”

For a moment, the entire Nanzhou was in a panic.

Whether the powerful or ordinary cultivators, they all felt a trace of fear in their hearts.

Some people took advantage of these few days to head toward the East Continent and left Nanzhou.

Some were even prepared to die, waiting for their deaths.

The border of Xihuang was empty, and no one dared to approach it.

Time flew.

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

That night, Chao Cang and Chao Shou came to Qin Yu’s prison.

They looked down at him and said, “Tomorrow is your day. Are you ready?”

Qin Yu had been tortured to the point where he no longer looked like a human. He was hanging in the air, his messy hair covering his face and blood spattering on the ground. The whole scene looked miserable.

“Say a few nice words, and we might let you die a quick death,” Chao Cang said in a sinister voice.

Qin Yu raised his head with difficulty and spat on their faces.

Chao Cang’s expression turned cold, and he snorted. “You reckless fool. I hope you can still be so unyielding tomorrow!”

After saying this, the two turned around and left.

The next morning. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

A large group of people from Xihuang gathered.

Under the leadership of the two brothers of the Chao family, they were prepared to enter Nanzhou in one fell swoop.

And this scene was also projected in the sky above Nanzhou.

“It’s over. They’re coming.”

“I’m afraid Nanzhou can’t escape from this disaster.”

“If it’s possible, we’re willing to surrender.”

Although they said that, they had awful feelings in their hearts.

With the evil character of the two Chao brothers, they would not treat them well.

Chao Cang held Qin Yu’s hair with one hand and said with a cold smile, “Don’t worry. We’ll go to Nanzhou now.”

Qin Yu opened his mouth, but no words came out.

He had suffered inhuman torture in the past few days. Whether it was his body or his mind, he had suffered great trauma.

“This time, not only are we going to kill Xiao Sheng, but we are also going to take over Nanzhou. If there is a chance, we will sweep the entire Lizhou!” Chao Shou said coldly.

“Everyone, on my command. Set off to Nanzhou!”

With his order, the entire Pilgrimage City was moved.

They exuded extremely powerful internal qi and were ready to head to Nanzhou.

However, at this moment, the air trembled.

Then, a colossal teleportation gate appeared in front of them.

Before anyone could doubt it, a large group of people in cold armor walked out of the portal.

At a glance, at least hundreds of fully armed cultivators had stepped into Xihuang.
