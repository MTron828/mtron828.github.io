Chapter 1384: Chapter 1384, DON’T ASK! 1

Qin Yu followed Ding Yi to the library.

On the way, Qin Yu asked casually, “Ding Yi, what do you plan to do in the future? Why Don’t you choose to cultivate?”

Ding Yi glanced at Qin Yu and said, “Do you think I don’t want to? It’s already good enough for a person like me to survive, not to mention that my cultivation isn’t low either.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh.

“What? You Don’t believe me?”Ding Yi glared at Qin Yu and immediately released the aura in his body.

A weak aura immediately rushed toward him.

“How is it? Do you feel the pressure?”Ding Yi said with some pride.

Qin Yu coughed dryly and said, “You... Don’t even have the nascent Soul Realm, right?”

“Even? You talk big.”Ding Yi glared at Qin Yu. “I can be considered an itinerant cultivator. To be able to cultivate to such a realm is already considered not bad, okay?”

Qin Yu smiled but didn’t say anything.

The holy region was a place where strength was respected. As long as one had talent, they would definitely have a chance to stand out.

For example, Ding Yi’s hometown. Those with talent had long been taken away by the major sects.

“Maybe you can try to find a sect to cultivate, even if it’s just a small one,”Qin Yu advised.

Ding Yi rolled his eyes and said, “I’m not going to any sect. I want to be a heroine who abhors evil like that Qin Yu!”

Qin Yu sighed and said, “Qin Yu just has no choice. Do you think he doesn’t want to settle down?”

“Don’t act like you know him very well, okay?”Ding Yi said angrily.

“Qin Yu killed Ling Yun with his own ability. The entire Tianyun sect hasn’t been able to find him. Isn’t this something to be proud of?”

Qin Yu was speechless and didn’t know what to say.

“Even though I don’t have Qin Yu’s ability, I will do what I can.”Ding Yi snorted.

“When I see injustice, I will draw my sword to help. When I meet a weak person being bullied, I will also act righteously.”

Qin Yu gave Ding Yi a thumbs up and said, “I admire your way of doing things.”

Ding Yi snorted and said, “A person like you will not understand.”

As they spoke, the two of them had already arrived at the library.

It was an extremely large attic. The entire building emitted a golden glow and looked extremely dazzling.

“Let’s go. This is the place,”Ding Yi pulled Qin Yu and said. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The two of them walked into the library. As soon as they entered the door, an ancient aura assaulted their faces.

It was obvious that this library had been here for many years, and the number of people who came to the library was not many.

“Do you come every week?”Qin Yu asked casually.

Ding Yi nodded and said, “I try my best to come once a week.”

Qin Yu nodded and then asked, “Where are the books related to the history of the South Province?”

Hearing this, Ding Yi couldn’t help but roll his eyes and said, “Why are you looking at that thing? Does it have anything to do with you? For You, the most important thing now is to improve your strength! learn more cultivation techniques!”

“You’re right. I’ll remember the lesson, but I want to know more about the South Province now. Can you tell me where it is?”Qin Yu gradually lost her patience.

Ding Yi seemed to see Qin Yu’s displeasure, so he didn’t waste any more words. She pointed to a spot and said, “Most of them are over there. Go and take a look yourself.”

Qin Yu grunted and walked in that direction.

“Ah!”

But at this moment, Ding Yi suddenly screamed behind her!

Not only that, Qin Yu clearly felt a strong killing intent approaching!

Turning around, she saw a sharp blade approaching Ding Yi’s glabella!

Ding Yi tried to resist, but her strength was too weak, and she couldn’t resist at all!

In a moment of desperation, Qin Yu didn’t even bother to hide her strength. He suddenly shook and instantly appeared in front of Ding Yi, his palm blocking Ding Yi’s forehead.

“Dang!”

With a crisp sound, Qin Yu’s palm exploded!

The sharp blade was instantly bent! On the other hand, Qin Yu’s palm was intact!

Ding Yi was so scared that his whole body was trembling. She subconsciously looked at Qin Yu’s palm, and her expression changed again.

“Your Hand...”Ding Yi pointed at Qin Yu’s palm.

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly. He hurriedly put his palm in his pocket and said casually, “My hand is fine.”

Ding Yi wanted to say something, but Qin Yu changed the topic. “Where did that knife come from? Who Did you offend? Why did someone want to kill you?”

“I. . . I don’t know either,”Ding Yi said. “I’ve never offended anyone before...”

Qin Yu walked out of the library quickly. His eyes scanned the surroundings, but he didn’t find anything unusual.

Obviously, the person who had attacked had already escaped.

“Damn it.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse in her heart.

She had accidentally exposed her strength. If it were to be spread out, she would be in trouble.

Soon, Ding Yi also came out. She stared at Qin Yu and asked curiously, “Why are you unharmed?”

“Because I have a magic artifact in my hand,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“But...”

“There’s no buts. Don’t ask, Okay?”Qin Yu’s voice became extremely cold.
