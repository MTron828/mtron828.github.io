1807 Hundreds of Primordial Spirits

Gu Sanchen sighed and said, “I didn’t expect to be tricked by you.”

“I’m really sorry. Brother Gu, please forgive me,” Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

Gu Sanchen didn’t say anything else and just nodded slightly.

“I’m afraid we can’t enter this Forbidden Zone. Let’s drop this idea,” Gu Sanchen said after that. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

If they wanted to enter this Forbidden Zone, even Saint Weapons would be instantly disintegrated, let alone their physical bodies.

!!

Therefore, the group immediately planned to leave.

However, at this moment, Qin Yu suddenly sensed a strange movement in his Spatial Magic Artifact.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He immediately sent a wisp of his divine sense into the Spatial Magic Artifact.

He could only see that the token of the Satan he had obtained previously was shining!

Not only that, but the Venerable Fifth Mountain was also shining at the same time!

Qin Yu couldn’t help but be shocked!

Could it be that this Forbidden Zone was the entrance to Satan? And the token in Qin Yu’s hand and the Venerable Fifth Mountain were the keys to this Forbidden Zone?

Qin Yu was silent, but he was extremely shocked.

Perhaps it was because of this that the young master of the Tong family was so eager to get this token!

For the same reason, the Tong family did not dare to invade Nanzhou on a big scale and find trouble with Xiao Sheng. Instead, they came to the God Bless Sect in the East Continent!

There was no other reason than they were afraid that this matter would spread and attract the attention of other families!

“Brother Qin?” Gu Sanchen seemed to have noticed Qin Yu’s abnormality and immediately shouted.

“I’m fine,” Qin Yu came back to his senses, smiled, and said.

The group turned around and left the Forbidden Zone.

Fortunately, they didn’t go too far. If they went forward a few more steps, they probably wouldn’t be able to come out.

That crack just happened to separate the two places.

After leaving the Forbidden Zone, Gu Sanchen looked at Qin Yu and said, “It’s time for you to go back and report your mission.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “That’s right. It’s all thanks to Brother Gu this time. Otherwise, I’m afraid it wouldn’t be so easy to kill Yang Yu.”

“Then let’s part here. Do we meet again if we are fated to?” Gu Sanchen asked tentatively.

“No! No! No! I’m afraid we’ll have to trouble Brother Gu to send us back because our formation is nearby there,” Qin Yu said with a trace of embarrassment.

“Then let’s go,” Gu Sanchen said, spreading his hands.

He summoned the giant anaconda and rushed toward Heavenly Ocean City.

“Brother Gu, why don’t you scout around the Forbidden Zone? There might be some treasures there,” Qin Yu asked casually on the way.

Gu Sanchen shook his head and said, “There’s a special organization in the Crimson Moon Continent. They come here to explore every day. After such a long time, not to mention treasure, I’m afraid not even the shadow of the treasure can be seen.”

Qin Yu nodded. That was indeed true.

After a few days, they finally returned to Heavenly Ocean City.

This time, they were probably really going to part.

“Let’s meet again if we are fated to,” Gu Sanchen said with a smile.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “We’ll meet again soon. I’ll go to Zhongzhou soon.”

“Then… see you in Zhongzhou?” Gu Sanchen said with a smile.

“See you in Zhongzhou.” Qin Yu nodded.

He didn’t stay for long and immediately left Heavenly Ocean City. He seemed to be rushing to the next Forbidden Zone.

Gu Sanchen didn’t take his words seriously. It was because many people wanted to go to Zhongzhou, but only a handful could make it and became well-known.

However, he had never expected this young man named Qin Yu to have caused a great reshuffling of the entire Holy Region in the future and even caused the whole universe to tremble.

…

“Are we going back now?” Jue Wu asked after Gu Sanchen left.

“No,” Qin Yu shook his head and said. “Let’s go to Yang Yu’s house to take a look. I didn’t see any Saint Weapons on him just now. I’m afraid he has hidden them at home.”

“You’re still the wisest!” Jue Wu pointed at Qin Yu and said.

Qin Yu didn’t waste time. He immediately took Jue Wu and stepped into the city again.

After arriving at the door of Yang Yu’s house, Qin Yu discovered a formation had been set up at Yang Yu’s house. It was impossible to step in.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He raised his palm and tried to put it on the formation. However, as soon as he put it on, he felt an inexplicable force attacking him.

“Let me shatter it with one punch!” Jue Wu said, waving her little hand.

“No!” Qin Yu quickly shook his head and said. “We’ll get into trouble if someone discovers it.”

“Then what do we do?” Jue Wu frowned and asked.

Qin Yu remained silent, not knowing what to do.

Heavenly Ocean City was under the attention of the City Lord. As the City Lord, he must have owned a Saint Weapon.

If he attracted their attention, he would definitely die.

“Let’s wait until nighttime,” Qin Yu said.

Under the worst scenario, he could only quickly break in and escape.

At night.

Qin Yu and Jue Wu once again arrived at Yang Yu’s house.

His fist emitted rays of dazzling light with powerful strength lingering around it.

Although it was very risky to do so, it was worthwhile if he could obtain a Saint Weapon.

Therefore, Qin Yu clenched his fist and threw a punch.

This punch was powerful, and Yang Yu’s formation was not good enough.

A ray of light flashed, and then it shattered like glass.

“Let’s go.” Qin Yu looked at Jue Wu.

The two of them didn’t waste time and quickly walked in.

Yang Yu’s house was huge. Thus they released their divine senses, wanting to find the Saint Weapon as soon as possible.

Unfortunately, he couldn’t find any trace of the Saint Weapon under the coverage of divine sense.

“Could it be that Yang Yu doesn’t have a Saint Weapon at all? Or was it already shattered in the Forbidden Zone?” Qin Yu murmured.

Jue Wu scratched her head and said, “Could it be that it has been wrapped up by some techniques?”

“Let’s split up and look for it,” Qin Yu said.

Jue Wu nodded, and the two immediately began a thorough search in different directions.

It took a full two hours.

Qin Yu and Jue Wu didn’t find anything. They didn’t find the so-called Saint Weapon.

In the backyard.

Qin Yu and Jue Wu met here.

“Did you find it?” Jue Wu asked.

“No,” Qin Yu shook his head.

“It seems that Yang Yu doesn’t have any Saint Weapon,” Jue Wu said in a low voice.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly. It seemed to be the only explanation.

“Let’s go back and report,” Jue Wu pulled Qin Yu and said.

“Okay!” Qin Yu replied. Just as he was about to leave, he suddenly smelled blood.

“Eh?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

He immediately activated his desolate divine eye and looked in a particular direction.

He saw a huge pit in front of him.

The smell of blood was coming from this hole.

Qin Yu quickly walked over and saw there were corpses one after another in the pit!

In the center of the corpses, there was a magical artifact that looked like a pure jade bottle.

Without thinking, Qin Yu quickly grabbed the magic artifact and opened it.

The moment he opened it, Qin Yu was shocked!

There were hundreds of primordial spirits in the magical artifact!
