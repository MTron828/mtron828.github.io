Chapter 531: Wedding! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Yan Sihai appeared calm on the surface, but in reality, he had already lost it.

He clenched his fists tightly while wishing he could tear Qin Yu into pieces!

At this moment, his hatred for Qin Yu had reached its peak.

...

Qin Yu brought Old Mister Yan out of the Yan Manor.

“Old Mister Yan, you know that Yan Sihai is looking for you. Why did you come to Jingdu?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but ask.

Old Mister Yan said somewhat sorrowfully, “My beloved granddaughter is getting married. How could I not come...”

Qin Yu was momentarily speechless.

He knew that Old Mister Yan loved Yan Ruoxue the most, but he didn’t think that he would take such a risk to come and visit Yan Ruoxue.

“Old Mister Yan, don’t worry. I won’t let Han Wei succeed,” Qin Yu said.

Old Mister Yan sighed slightly, and his expression didn’t look good.

The three of them temporarily found a place to stay.

Looking at the once familiar manor of the Yan family, Old Mister Yan was filled with mixed feelings.

He never thought that one day, he would be driven out of Jingdu by his own son!

“Old Mister Yan, don’t worry too much. Tomorrow, I’ll go with you to attend that so-called wedding,” Qin Yu said.

Old Mister Yan nodded. He looked at Qin Yu and said, “Ruoxue and I believe in you.”

...

The news of Qin Yu’s arrival in Jingdu quickly spread.

The Yan and Han families gathered together to discuss whether or not to attack Qin Yu in advance.

But this suggestion was rejected by Han Wei.

“No need to worry. I have absolute confidence in getting rid of Qin Yu,” Han Wei said with confidence.

Yan Sihai, who had been silent all this time, suddenly stood up and said coldly, “Even if you are confident, I will still deploy my own forces!”

“I want to let him know what it means to offend an aristocratic family!”

The sudden outburst gave everyone a fright.

The sudden change in Yan Sihai’s attitude made people feel even more puzzled.

“Mr. Yan, what’s going on?” Han Meng couldn’t help but ask.

Yan Sihai said coldly, “I must let this arrogant brat know what fear is!”

After saying this, Yan Sihai slammed the door and left.

With his connections and strength, there was no telling how much power he could mobilize!

After a few phone calls, Yan Sihai mobilized close to eight Martial Marquises!

Those were Martial Marquises! Eight Martial Marquises was almost equivalent to the number of all the Martial Marquises in Jingdu!

Other than the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, probably no one could go against these eight people!

Apart from that, Yan Sihai also called dozens of gunmen to attend the wedding as well!

This was enough to prove how angry Yan Sihai was!

That night, Jingdu was peaceful. Everyone was waiting for the wedding of the century the next day.

Qin Yu stood in front of the hotel window, but was unable to fall asleep for a long time.

His emotions were extremely complicated. He couldn’t wait for the next day, but he was also somewhat afraid of the arrival of the next day.

“Ruoxue...” Qin Yu muttered her name in a low voice. He couldn’t help but clench his fists.

Jingdu didn’t lack rich people.

Below the hotel, the roar of sports cars could be heard from time to time.

Qin Yu looked down at this group of rich people and couldn’t help but sigh. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

People really had different lives.

Some people risked their lives just for a few taels of silver.

And some people were born into wealth.

There were also people like Qin Yu who struggled to survive all day long.

Time flew by.

In the blink of an eye, the second day had arrived.

Before dawn, Qin Yu and the other two left the hotel and went straight to the wedding venue.

At this moment, there were already people gathered at the wedding venue.

“No matter what, we must let Qin Yu die here today,” a cold voice said.

These three people were none other than the three Martial Marquises from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!

“Yan Sihai seems to have mobilized eight Martial Marquises,” another person said.

“Yan Sihai seems to be having a headache from this kid. With his help, things might be a lot easier.”

“Or maybe we don’t need to make a move. The Han family’s kid will get rid of Qin Yu.”

After that, the three people slowly disappeared.

Qin Yu, Old Mister Yan, and the others rushed toward the small mountain.

The remote suburbs of the small mountain were extremely lively today.

Countless luxury cars were parked at the foot of the mountain.

There were rolls-Royces, Bentleys, Mercedes-Benz, and so on.

And on the mountain, the huge mountain peak artificially supported a large piece of flat land.

On this flat land, there were flowers and fine wine.

And there were countless tables and chairs to welcome these guests.

Looking up from the foot of the mountain, one could see a huge sign.

There were a few words written on it:

Groom: Han Wei.

Bride: Yan Ruoxue.

All the important people of Jingdu had come. Other than that, there were also many guests who had come because they had heard about the wedding. The Han and Yan families didn’t reject anyone who came.

In front, Han Meng and Yan Sihai were sitting together while quietly watching this grand scene.

“How many years has it been since Jingdu has had such a grand scene?” Han Meng sighed.

Yan Sihai took a puff of his cigar and snorted lightly. “The last time so many people came to support us was on my dad’s birthday.”

“That’s right.” Han Meng nodded slightly.

The reason why the Yan family was able to develop to this day was because of Emperor Yan!

In the entire Jingdu, everyone respected him!

Even the Old Master of the Han family couldn’t be mentioned in the same breath!

More and more guests came, and the entire venue was almost filled with people.

A helicopter landed on the mountain. It was unknown which big shot had descended.

“The people from the Chu family have also come,” Han Meng said.

Yan Sihai snorted lightly, “Who cares? Our marriage alliance will make us the most powerful ones in Jingdu!”

Han Meng nodded slightly and smiled, “With our marriage alliance, there is indeed no one in Jingdu who is a match for us.”

“The Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion is also here.” At this moment, Yan Sihai suddenly noticed a beautiful figure.

“Huh? That person seems a little familiar. He seems to be Elder Li.”

“Marquis Bai Wu is also here.”

Many big shots in the martial arts world also came to the scene.

Xia Hang of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association was naturally waiting here early.

“Dad, Uncle Yan.”

At this moment, Han Wei, dressed in a white suit, walked in front of the two of them.

“You still call him Uncle Yan? Change your address,” Han Meng said with a smile.

Han Meng hurriedly said, “Dad!”

Yan Sihai nodded slightly, as if he had acknowledged this son-in-law.

The scene was filled with joy and harmony. Someone held a wine glass and came forward to toast.

“Congratulations, Young Master Han. Young Master Han and Miss Yan are truly a match made in heaven!”

“The marriage between the Yan and Han families will definitely bring the two families to a new level!”

Han Wei was also full of pride. He held the wine glass and thanked them one by one. His excitement was unconcealed.

Just as everyone was laughing and cheering, an explosive sound suddenly came from not far away!

They saw a golden light flash past and ruthlessly smash towards the signboard that had the words “Bride and Groom” printed on it!

The signboard immediately shattered!

Following that, they saw a young man holding the signboard that had been smashed into two as he walked up the mountain step by step.
