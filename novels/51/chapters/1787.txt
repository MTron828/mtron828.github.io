1788 The Provocation of the Devil Hunter

After leaving the brothel, Qin Yu rushed back with Jue Wu worriedly.

Along the way, his addiction acted up from time to time. Moreover, it was getting even more intense each time.

Qin Yu could only close his eyes slightly, adjust his state of mind, and try his very best to restrain himself.

However, the more he did this, the more irritable he became.

After much time, Qin Yu finally returned to Thunder Courtyard.

The two of them had left Thunder Courtyard for ten days or so, while the other members had returned long ago.

Seeing the two take such a long time to rush back, the other members couldn’t help but mock, “You guys are really inefficient.”

Qin Yu ignored them. He pulled Jue Wu, who was about to quarrel with them and quickly returned to the cave abode.

After completing this mission, a number, “3”, appeared on their tokens.

These were the points earned for completing the mission. With these points, one could go to the first main peak to exchange for cultivation techniques, Meridian Circulation Technique, and even magic artifacts.

“Hopefully, Thunder Courtyard has a restraining Meridian Circulation Technique,” thought Qin Yu.

As a descendant of Immortal Emperor Lei, most likely, he would have a restraining Meridian Circulation Technique.

However, Qin Yu didn’t know Dean Lei well. He wasn’t even close to him. Thus he couldn’t ask him at all.

Furthermore, in his current state, he might even become the target of Demon-slaying Peak. Thus Qin Yu didn’t dare to tell him.

At this moment, he heard some movement from outside.

He looked up and found out it was Xiaobai.

Qin Yu was planning to gather some information from him. Thus when he saw Xiaobai walking in, he quickly got up and greeted him.

“Qin Yu, how was the mission this time?” Xiaobai asked with a smile.

“I didn’t do anything. It was all done by Jue Wu,” Qin Yu said casually.

Xiaobai looked at Jue Wu, smiled, and said, “That’s true. With such a tough bodyguard by your side, you don’t need to do anything.”

Qin Yu asked, “Xiaobai, when will the next mission be?”

“Not sure. It can be ten days, half a month, or very soon,” Xiaobai said.

“Why? You can’t wait?” he said jokingly.

“Yeah, it’s boring to stay in Thunder Courtyard,” Qin Yu smiled and said.

Xiaobai patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “It’ll be at least after three days because there’ll be a dao lecture after three days. We’ll have to wait until the dao lecture is over.”

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. He was somewhat curious about this lecture.

“By the way, Xiaobai, what do you think we should do if there are evil people in Demon-slaying Peak?” Qin Yu took the opportunity to ask.

“Why do you ask this?” Xiaobai asked, raising his eyebrows.

“I’m just curious,” Qin Yu said perfunctorily.

Xiaobai laughed and said, “Actually, there was such a thing. Previously there was a very talented Devil Hunter. He went astray and cultivated the evil ways.”

“And then what happened?” Qin Yu asked impatiently.

“He was killed by the Law Enforcement Elder of Thunder Courtyard,” Xiaobai said.

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly. He frowned and said, “Since he went astray, why didn’t they save him? Instead, they chose to kill him directly?”

Xiaobai spread his hands and said, “It was the dean’s order. Because once he left Thunder Courtyard, he would ruin the reputation of Thunder Courtyard. Speaking of which, those who cultivate in Thunder Courtyard will be extremely powerful in the future. In case he escaped, it would be hard to find him.

“Therefore, it’s best to kill him.”

Qin Yu’s heart skipped a beat.

From the looks of it, it was unrealistic to ask for the cultivation technique from the dean. He probably would only bring a fatal disaster upon himself. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“By the way, how many points does it need to exchange for cultivation techniques?” Qin Yu asked.

“It depends on what kind of cultivation technique. But it’s usually between 30 and 50 points. There are some over 100, but not many.

“Of course, the more precious the cultivation technique is, the higher the points required.”

“Can I give away the cultivation technique as a gift?” Qin Yu asked after some thought.

“Sure,” Xiaobai said.

He then took out his points and waved in front of Qin Yu.

There was a number written on it, “58”.

“I accumulated for a long time to get this,” Xiaobai said with emotion.

“Of course, this number is also considered quite high.”

“Then who has the highest points?” Qin Yu continued to ask.

“Of course, it’s Jiu Xiao. He accumulated more than 1,000 a long time ago. In other words, he can practice all the cultivation techniques in Thunder Courtyard,” Xiaobai said.

“If I could only have half of his, I would also feel content,” Xiaobai said with emotion.

Upon hearing this, Qin Yu was very shocked!

He and Jue Wu only earned three points for this mission. But Jiu Xiao had more than a thousand points!

What kind of concept was this?

“That’s strange. How many missions does he have to accomplish to earn 1,000 points…” Qin Yu looked at the pathetic number “3” in his hand.

Xiaobai explained, “The difficulty level of each mission is different, so the points vary. For example, the mission to go to Zhongzhou is 20 points or more.

“Jiu Xiao almost always went to Zhongzhou and killed the most evil people.”

Qin Yu finally understood.

“Zhongzhou…” Qin Yu murmured.

“You must tell me if there is a mission in Zhongzhou next time,” Qin Yu looked at Xiaobai and said.

Xiaobai shook his head and said, “If you want to go to Zhongzhou, you must get Jiu Xiao’s permission before going. Only he and the peak master can take the mission going to Zhongzhou. As for who can go, he will choose among us.”

“It turned out to be this way…” Qin Yu’s face was a little ugly.

He didn’t know Jiu Xiao at all. Furthermore, most of the people here had reached the Reversion Void Stage and he was only a mighty realm cultivator. Jiu Xiao definitely would choose someone else.

“It looks like I have to find time to pay a visit to Jiu Xiao,” Qin Yu muttered.

Xiaobai laughed and said, “If you want to get in through the back door, don’t waste your energy. Jiu Xiao is very arrogant. However, he is also very fair in doing his work.”

At this point, Xiaobai switched the topic of the conversation and said, “Of course, he will give you a chance. He will give everyone a chance.”

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. He then said, “Alright. Thank you.”

After that, the two chatted for a while. Jue Wu caught some prey from the mountain, and the three of them gathered together to have a satisfactory meal.

Not long after Xiaobai left, the previous burly man came to their door again.

He sniffed and said with a smile, “You’re eating good food again. You guys really know how to enjoy yourselves.”

Jue Wu glanced at him and said, “Quickly get lost. Last time, you wasted a piece of my meat. I haven’t settled the score with you yet!”

This burly man ignored Jue Wu like previously. He stared at Qin Yu and said with a smile, “Qin Yu, I’m here to issue you a challenge letter.”

“I don’t accept.” Qin Yu shook his head without thinking.

The burly man said with a smile, “Sorry, you can’t reject a challenge letter in Demon-slaying Peak. You can only admit defeat.”
