Chapter 342: Leave the Divine Alchemist Pavilion Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu, who had just finished refining the pill, didn’t have the slightest intention of resting. He turned and walked towards the Pavilion Master’s residence.

The Divine Alchemist Pavilion Master’s residence was located in the deepest part of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

The Divine Alchemist Pavilion itself was located in a huge canyon, and the Pavilion Master’s residence was built on top of the canyon.

From a high vantage point, one could overlook more than half of the city. It looked like a pavilion in the sky.

More importantly, the top had been meticulously decorated. There were mountains, rivers, and ponds, and the residence was quite ancient.

Qin Yu came to the bottom. Then, with a deep leap, he went up to the loft.

However, just as Qin Yu’s body rose into the air, he was slapped down by a huge force!

This force was incomparably powerful. Like swatting a fly, it pushed Qin Yu to the ground.

The person who made a move was the Pavilion Master herself.

She stood in the attic and looked at Qin Yu. She said indifferently, “Who allowed you to come up?”

Qin Yu got up from the ground and couldn’t help but curse inside.

This woman was so fickle! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Pavilion Master, I have something to ask of you.” Qin Yu cupped his hands and said.

The Pavilion Master glanced at Qin Yu and snorted lightly. “Remember, next time, you aren’t allowed to come up without my permission.”

“Got it, Pavilion Master.” Qin Yu smiled bitterly.

Then, the Pavilion Master turned around and disappeared from his sight.

Qin Yu scratched his head and thought to himself, “Does this mean she agreed to let me go up?”

After thinking for a moment, Qin Yu tried to jump up to the pavilion.

This time, the Pavilion Master didn’t slap Qin Yu down.

Instead, she sat at the edge of the pond and slowly tasted the tea.

Qin Yu walked forward. Just as he was about to speak, he smelled a strange aroma from the tea leaves.

“Pavilion Master, these tea leaves... aren’t ordinary.” Qin Yu stared at the teacup and said.

“It’s Enlightenment Tea.” The Pavilion Master said indifferently.

When he heard these words, Qin Yu’s body suddenly tightened!

Enlightenment Tea! The Pavilion Master actually also had Enlightenment Tea!

“You...” Qin Yu opened his mouth and couldn’t help but think of his father!

Could it be that... the Pavilion Master also knew his father?

“What, are you very surprised?” The Pavilion Master glanced at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu shook his head and didn’t continue to think about it.

“Pavilion Master, I have a request,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“You want to advance the payment of herbs and cultivate in seclusion?” The Pavilion Master took a sip of tea and casually revealed Qin Yu’s plan.

Qin Yu said with some surprise, “How did you know?”

The Pavilion Master didn’t answer this question, but said indifferently, “I’m afraid you won’t be able to cultivate in seclusion in time.”

“Won’t be able to cultivate in seclusion in time?” Qin Yu was stunned.

He asked with some confusion, “What do you mean?”

The Pavilion Master stood up. She looked at the pond in front of her and slowly said, “You’d better go to Jingdu as soon as possible and accompany your girlfriend.”

“Accompany my girlfriend... You mean Yan Ruoxue?” Qin Yu’s expression changed.

He hurriedly asked, “Pavilion Master, did something happen to Miss Yan?”

“Something happened?” A hint of contempt flashed across the Pavilion Master’s face.

“She is the princess of the Yan family, the apple of Yan Yunheng’s eye. What could happen to her?”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Then what you mean is...”

The Pavilion Master’s expression turned cold, and she said unhappily, “You talk too much. Do you want others to tell you everything?”

After saying this, the Pavilion Master waved her sleeve, and a terrifying power sent Qin Yu flying from the pavilion.

This power was extremely terrifying, and it sent half of Qin Yu’s body into the stone wall.

Qin Yu used all his strength to pull his head out of the stone wall.

This b * tch was even more capricious than the weather!

But... what did she mean by what she said?

Qin Yu thought to himself as he walked towards his own residence.

The residence of the Third Elder had been vacated, and now, it had become Qin Yu’s residence.

Just as Qin Yu walked to the door, anguish flashed through him again.

Although this feeling flashed through his mind, it made him feel extremely uneasy.

Qin Yu didn’t leave his residence for the entire day.

His mind was on the words that the Pavilion Master had said.

“What exactly does she mean?”

At night, Qin Yu stood on the side of a small bridge in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion with his eyes fixed on the calm lake water.

“Plop!”

A carp jumped from the river with all its might and crossed the Dragon Gate.

But at this moment, the carp’s eyes rolled and it died.

Its body sank quietly in the river.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and stared at the carp.

“This fish has been trying its best to cross the Dragon Gate all its life.” At this moment, a voice came from behind Qin Yu.

It was the Pavilion Master.

Qin Yu hurriedly bowed and said, “Greetings, Pavilion Master.”

The Pavilion Master ignored him. She pointed at the surface of the lake and said, “Do you know how it died?”

Qin Yu looked at the surface of the lake. After thinking for a moment, she said, “Died of old age?”

“That’s right. It seems that you aren’t that stupid.” The Pavilion Master stretched.

She yawned and said, “I’m sleepy. It’s time to rest.”

After saying this, the Pavilion Master’s figure instantly disappeared.

“Died of old age...” Qin Yu muttered softly.

His expression suddenly changed, as if he had thought of something!

“Could it be... Old Mister Yan?” Qin Yu seemed to have understood the Pavilion Master’s meaning!

Old Mister Yan had already reached the end of his life. Combined with the hint from the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, Qin Yu finally understood!

“Old Mister Yan...” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice. There was an indescribable sense of pain inside.

He looked at the surface of the lake once again. Then, he took a deep leap and jumped onto the surface of the lake.

Qin Yu waved his hand and fished out the dead carp from the river.

Then, Qin Yu placed his palm on the carp’s body. A stream of spiritual energy flowed into Qin Yu’s hand.

The carp that was already dead slowly came back to life at this moment!

Qin Yu placed the carp back into the lake, and determination flashed in his eyes.

Even though Qin Yu didn’t say anything, it seemed like he was determined.

This scene didn’t escape the Pavilion Master’s eyes.

She quietly looked at Qin Yu’s back and said in a low voice, “He really resembles his father.”

...

The next day, Qin Yu packed his luggage and prepared to leave the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

“Qin Yu, are you leaving already?” Taozi, who came after hearing the news, seemed to be a little puzzled.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, I have something to deal with, so I won’t stay any longer.”

At this moment, the Fifth Elder also walked over.

He couldn’t help but sigh and said, “You’re leaving just after becoming an elder. You’re really something.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “Fifth Elder, when I succeed and become famous, I’ll definitely come back.”

“Okay!” The Fifth Elder patted Qin Yu’s shoulder.

“Before you leave, go and say goodbye to the Pavilion Master,” Fifth Elder exhorted.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, I’m planning to go.”
