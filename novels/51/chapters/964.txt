Chapter 965: Chapter 965, my own path

After Qin Yu came down from the nine Pinnacles Mountain, he rushed straight to the Zhuang family.

At this moment, the vicinity of the Zhuang family had already been isolated. Without permission, no one was allowed to come near.

When Qin Yu arrived at the Zhuang family, his expression immediately became a little ugly.

The Zhuang family, which had once enjoyed life day and night, was now in a state of decline.

Even though they were very far away, Qin Yu could smell the faint yin qi that was emitted from the manor.

Qin Yu took a deep breath, his figure flashed explosively, and he stepped into the manor.

On the ground, there were corpses one after another. These corpses were so tragic that anyone who saw them would find it hard to accept.

Looking at the surrounding scene, Qin Yu’s expression became increasingly gloomy.

“F * ck... Sky Blood Rainbow...”Qin Yu’s eyes were bloodshot and filled with fury!

He bent down and picked up a corpse, preparing to put it into the spatial artifact.

However, the moment he picked up the corpse, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown slightly.

Although these corpses had their divine senses absorbed, they were somewhat different from Sky Blood Rainbow’s methods.

Qin Yu had seen with his own eyes sky blood rainbow’s methods. The evil ghosts he summoned would directly extract a person’s divine sense.

And the corpses in front of him seemed to have forcefully taken away a person’s spiritual sense after killing them.

“I seem to have seen this method before...”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s pupils suddenly constricted as he thought of a person!

He Teng!

This method was extremely similar to He Teng’s methods!

“Could it be... He Teng did it!”Qin Yu’s expression became even colder.

Before Qin Yu could think, he felt someone approaching.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to waste any more time. He quickly put away the corpses and turned around to leave.

Not long after Qin Yu left, Gu Xinghe rushed over.

Looking at the corpses that were taken away, Gu Xinghe couldn’t help but curse.

“I miscalculated!”Gu Xinghe gritted his teeth, his face getting gloomier and gloomier.

“I knew it. Someone must have taken the body away, and that person is most likely Qin Yu!”

Zhai Xing sniffed his internal qi and nodded, “It is indeed Qin Yu.”

“Damn it!”This made Gu Xinghe even angrier!

He punched the wall hard and couldn’t help but curse, “If I knew this would happen, I wouldn’t have let the Heavenly Blood Rainbow take the blame!”

“What do you mean?”Zhai Xing frowned.

Before Gu Xinghe could say anything, the long-browed man beside him snorted, “Of course, I’ll let Qin Yu take the blame. Master Zhai Xing, did your cultivation damage your brain?”

Zhai Xing didn’t say anything and stood there silently.

Gu Xinghe narrowed his eyes and sneered, “It seems that Qin Yu has already left the mountain.”

“Do you want me to take action?”Zhai Xing asked.

Gu Xinghe waved his hand and said, “No! I want to use Qin Yu’s hand to get rid of these traitors!”

Ever since the appearance of the Mystic Realm Warriors, the Warriors of the current world had become increasingly dissatisfied with the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

On the surface, Gu Xinghe did not care at all, but in reality, he had long remembered all these people in his heart.

The Kong family, Yao family, Chu family, and so on all began to oppose the JINGDU martial arts association!

“As far as I know, Qin Yu seems to have mastered a technique called the heaven swallowing technique,”Gu Xinghe sneered.

“This kind of technique can absorb people’s inner strength for its own use, and he has used it many times in public.”

Long Mei suddenly came to a realization, cupped his hands and said, “Young Master GU is wise!”

Gu Xinghe sneered, “Qin Yu, not only do I want you to die, I also want you to die unjustly!”

Thus, Gu Xinghe turned around and returned to his office.

He found he teng again and told him his thoughts.

After he teng heard it, his eyes could not help but light up.

“Young master Gu, this is exactly what I want...”he teng licked his lips and said.

“I was just about to absorb all these people. Thank you, Young Master Gu...”

Gu Xinghe waved his hand and said, “Go. Remember, you have to come one by one and slowly cause panic, understand?”

“Don’t worry, I know this kind of thing...”he teng licked his lips and turned around to leave.

Zhai Xing couldn’t bear it and said, “Do you really want to kill so many people?”

“These people went against my will. They deserve to die!”Gu Xinghe shouted.

Zhai Xing sighed and thought to himself, “Young Master Gu, I’m afraid you’ve Lost Your Mind. If this continues, you’ll never be able to step into the martial saint realm...”

...

On the other side.

Qin Yu brought these corpses back to the nine Pinnacles Mountain. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The moment he saw the corpses, Zhuang Teng immediately burst into tears.

He knelt in front of these corpses that were no longer in human form and cried so many times that he lost his voice.

Everyone saw it and felt pain in their hearts.

“I’m sorry for your loss...”Yao Meng walked forward and comforted him softly.

Qin Yu, who was standing at the side, quietly waited for Zhuang Teng.

After an unknown amount of time, Zhuang Teng’s emotions gradually calmed down.

“Sky Blood Rainbow... I will definitely not let you off!”Zhuang Teng clenched his fists, his eyes almost spitting fire.

At this moment, Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “This matter... may not be done by Sky Blood Rainbow.”

“HMM?”Hearing this, everyone looked at Qin Yu in unison.

Qin Yu immediately explained the technique of Sky Blood Rainbow and the traces left on the corpses.

“I’ve seen the technique of the Sky Blood Rainbow with my own eyes. This definitely wasn’t done by the Sky Blood Rainbow,”Qin Yu said with a sullen face.

“If it wasn’t him, who else could it be?”Yao Meng said with a frown.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “He teng, this is exactly the same as he Teng’s technique.”

“He Teng? Is he the former number one person of the Central Plains?”Kong Yun exclaimed.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “This person is now working for the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. I’m guessing that this was probably done by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

“Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”

Hearing this, everyone’s eyes instantly widened!

“It can’t be. Although the Jingdu martial arts association is disgusting, it wouldn’t do such a vicious thing,”Chu Heng said from the side.

Qin Yu shook his head and said with a bitter smile, “If it was Granny Qin who controlled the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, perhaps she wouldn’t do such a thing. But now the person is Gu Xinghe. Gu Xinghe is already crazy.”

“Of course, this is just my guess.”Then, Qin Yu waved his hand again.

Everyone immediately fell into silence, as if they were thinking about this matter.

“I won’t accompany you guys anymore. I’m going down the mountain.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“I’ve already brought back the corpse. Why are you still going down the mountain?”Yao Meng asked.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “I’ve gradually found my own path.”

“In other words, I’ve already found the path to become a martial saint.”
