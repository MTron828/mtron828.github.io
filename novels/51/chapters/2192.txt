2193 The Holy Land of Cultivation

Qin Yu took a deep breath and made a firm decision in his heart.

From this day onward, he would call himself Qin Wuji, inheriting the legacy of Wu Ji and fulfilling his regrets for what he could not accomplish.

“Hello, Qin Wuji. My name is Yun Qingyun,” Qingyun said rather politely.

However, Qin Yu was expressionless, and he did not even respond.

At this moment, he only wanted to return to the Holy Region as soon as possible, or rather head to Earth.

Seeing Qin Yu being silent, Yun Qingyun thought Qin Yu was angry and thus explained, “Qin Wuji, don’t mind Brother Fengqing’s words, as he has always been more cautious.”

“It’s good to be cautious when you’re out,” Qin Yu nodded slightly and said.

Before Yun Qingyun could speak, Qin Yu said, “Please help me arrange accommodation. I want to rest now.”

“Oh, aright.” Qingyun had wanted to say something but suddenly came to a halt. She had no choice but to send someone to arrange accommodation for Qin Yu.

The warship was very spacious, and the place arranged for Qin Yu could even be called a courtyard.

The ground of the courtyard was covered with fine dolostone, and one would feel like walking in the sky when stepping on it. A faint light flowed on the surface of the stone like the celestial aura floating in the sky.

Translucent jade stone walls surrounded the courtyard, adorned with various mysterious immortal inscriptions and formations. As the breeze blew, the immortal inscriptions flickered and emitted a faint light.

A small and exquisite immortal spirit pond was in the middle of the courtyard. The water was crystal clear, like the spring water in the fairyland. Colorful petals and tiny light spots floated on the water like stars twinkling in the pond.

Qin Yu glanced over. It was indeed a good place for retreat.

“Please thank Miss Qingyun on my behalf,” Qin Yu turned around and said to the two attendants.

The two attendants nodded and left.

Following that, Qin Yu found a place to sit down. With a wave of his hand, the space distorted and sealed the courtyard.

Qin Yu found a place to sit down. Then he began breathing slowly and steadily, gradually restoring his internal qi.

In the outside world, the Yun family members were not too curious about Qin Yu’s arrival, except for Yun Fengqing.

His divine sense swept across Qin Yu’s courtyard occasionally, trying to discover something. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

However, when his divine sense swept across the courtyard, he found it empty and could not see anything.

“Strange.” Yun Fengqing frowned slightly and rubbed his chin. His eye expressions became even more puzzled.

After much contemplation, Yun Fengqing decided to go and investigate.

He tiptoed to the vicinity of Qin Yu’s courtyard and then extended his palm, intending to open the door.

“Brother Fengqing, why are you here?”

But at this moment, Qingyun’s voice suddenly sounded from behind.

Fengqing quickly turned around, frowned, and said, “Just now, I tried to use my divine sense to spy on his whereabouts. However, when my divine sense swept past this place, it was empty…”

“Brother Fengqing, how can you invade someone’s privacy?” Qingyun said in surprise.

Yun Fengqing instantly felt a headache.

He rubbed his head and appeared to be helpless.

At this moment, Yun Qingyun’s focus was actually so strange. She had indeed lived a pampered life.

“Qingyun, we should at least be on guard. This person’s whereabouts are uncertain, and his background is unknown. No one can guarantee his intentions,” Yun Fengqing explained patiently.

“But… He wouldn’t have to go through so much trouble if he was strong enough. And we don’t have to be afraid of him if he wasn’t, right?” Yun Qingyun said.

Yun Fengqing opened his mouth but was instantly speechless. For a moment, he didn’t know what to say.

At this moment, the door suddenly opened.

The sudden movement startled both of them.

Qin Yu glanced at them and said, “Miss Qingyun, do you know the coordinates of the Holy Region or Earth?”

Yun Qingyun shook her head and said, “I have never heard of…”

Qin Yu pondered for a while before asking, “Where’s your destination then?”

“Of course, it’s…”

“Why should I tell you?” Yun Fengqing said coldly.

“Brother Fengqing, don’t be so cold,” Yun Qingyun said.

Then she looked at Qin Yu, smiled, and said, “Qin Wuji, why don’t we talk while eating?”

Qin Yu thought for a moment. He indeed needed to gather some basic information now, so he nodded and agreed.

He followed behind the two and came to a courtyard. Various delicacies had been served in this courtyard. At a glance, it did not look like they were out for gaining experiences, but more like they were out for a holiday.

There was a huge wooden table in the center of the courtyard. At this moment, three elderly men were already sitting at the table, including Uncle Qun from the deck.

Qin Yu followed Yun Qingyun to the table and sat down. Then he asked the same question about the coordinates of the Holy Region or Earth.

The three elderly men shook their heads after hearing this, indicating they had never heard of it.

“I seem to have seen this place in an ancient book of the Yun family,” Uncle Qun opened his mouth and said at this moment.

Hearing this, Qin Yu raised his eyes and looked at Uncle Qun.

“That’s an ancient book recorded by my Yun family’s ancestors. He once went to this place called the Holy Region to cultivate.”

“Uncle Qun, what place is this Holy Region?” Yun Fengqing frowned.

“According to the records in the ancient book, the Holy Region is a land of immortals. Countless heaven’s favorites have gone there to cultivate and gain experience, more so the ancestors of our Yun family.”

Qin Yu was not in the mood to listen to his nonsense, so he asked impatiently, “Uncle Qun, do you know the coordinates of the Holy Region?”

Uncle Qun shook his head and said. “I merely caught a glimpse of it in the ancient book. As for the coordinates, I’ve never heard of it before.”

At this point, Uncle Qun changed the subject and continued, “However, this Holy Region is famous, so it shouldn’t be difficult to find its coordinates.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. It was indeed true. As long as he could find a star field to stop by, he would have a chance to locate the coordinates of the Holy Region.

“You care so much about the Holy Region. Could it be that you want to go there to cultivate?” Yun Fengqing raised his eyebrows and asked in a mocking tone.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Since it’s the Holy Land of Cultivation, I naturally want to go and take a look.”

“I would advise you to give up on this idea. According to the records of the Yun family’s ancient book, that ancestor only entered the Holy Region after entering the True Saint Realm. In the end, he returned to the Yun family. With your cultivation, even if you go to the Holy Region, the outcome won’t turn out well, “Uncle Qun shook his head and said.
