2346 The Holy Sword

Half a month passed, and the spiritual energy absorption suddenly stopped. It was actually absorbed by these spiritual energy spaces.

Jue Wu’s face was full of doubt. At this moment, Qin Yu’s skeleton had already fully grown.

However, his muscles and meridians had not formed yet. For these to form fully, it might require a vast amount of spiritual energy.

“This Glazed Holy Body is indeed terrifying. I feel this holy body to have endless power. Now I feel my spiritual energy will not exhaust again when I fight.”

Qin Yu waved his left hand without using any spiritual power at all.

However, the surrounding space shook the moment the glazed holy bone swept across. He felt the space could be torn apart if he were to exert a little more strength.

Moreover, every inch of bone contained endless spiritual energy.

A small piece of bone in his body could now blast a True Saint Realm cultivator.

And that Green Spirit Tree bore nearly 30 green fruits or so. Qin Yu plucked one and placed it into his mouth.

The fruit turned into a vast river of spiritual energy in his body and entered Qin Yu’s spine again.

As the spiritual energy entered, dozens of blood vessels slowly grew on Qin Yu.

Qin Yu was overjoyed. It was a spiritual energy fruit of higher grade than dews, and the spiritual energy within was even more exaggerated.

Qin Yu hesitated for a moment but did not eat the fruit.

These fruits could save lives at critical moments.

With a thought, the soul stone in his hand lit up again. Soon, he appeared in another enormous space.

Right in the center of the space, countless lights almost blinded Qin Yu’s eyes as soon as he entered.

It was a spiritual stone of life the size of a small mountain!

There was also a massive mountain peak intricately carved with lifelike mountainous scenery using spiritual essence!

F*ck! They were the spiritual stone of life and spiritual essence!

Qin Yu almost fainted. The entire Black Platform Continent had only collected a few thousand spiritual essences.

All these combined might not even be a corner of the mountain, but what appeared before him was a spiritual essence mountain!

“Behave! Behave! Qin Yu, d*mn it! You better behave yourself! Why are you acting like a country bumpkin?” Qin Yu thought to himself.

There were exceeding a hundred bottles of Spirit Gathering Sacred Pills and nearly a thousand pills. These were pills that could only be refined by the ninth-grade alchemists. All the herbs used were more than 10,000 years old and rich in spiritual energy. The energy of one pill was almost equivalent to the spiritual energy accumulated by Qin Yu’s eight Spirit Storage Beads.

There was a bronze cauldron by the side, which was also a spatial object. It was filled with Sumeru qi. This Sumeru qi was four to five times more than what he had obtained in the ninth level of purgatory!

“Heavenly Deity Pill!”

Qin Yu’s eyes widened. This pill was refined mainly using the herbs of Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivator’s divine sense nascent soul, supplemented by other ten-thousand-year-old herbs that contained the power of the soul. It contained a vast amount of pure soul power.

There were nearly 300 pills. It was equivalent to refining the nascent souls of more than 30 Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivators into pills.

What kind of cultivation realm was this Jee family’s survivor in? Could he be a Supreme Alchemist?

Qin Yu was greatly shocked. Everything here would trigger tremendous madness. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“I owe the Ji family a huge favor. How am I going to repay it?”

The choice he made with a thought had allowed him to gain such an advantage.

Qin Yu put everything into the Sumeru ring and examined the other locations.

There was also a holy sword floating in the air. Countless divine inscriptions were carved on it, and it gave off a destructive might.

What shocked Qin Yu was that the rules of the Path of Heaven surrounding the sword were completely distorted.

Within a radius of several dozen centimeters, the rules of the Path of Heaven completely disappeared.

The rules of heaven and earth were everywhere. Even in the lowest alternate dimensions, or even a speck of dust, was influenced by the rules of the Path of Heaven.

And this holy sword was something that even the rules of Path of Heaven could not approach. This sword was undoubtedly a supreme treasure!

The moment the divine sense came into contact with the holy sword, Qin Yu’s soul trembled violently as if it had come into contact with something extremely terrifying.

In the void, the holy sword suddenly began to spin slowly.

A surge of internal qi suddenly locked onto Qin Yu, who only felt his soul facing a colossal object.

“D*mn it! Why does divine sense exist?”

Qin Yu was greatly shocked. He felt someone controlling this holy sword. It seemed to be the Jee family’s ancestor’s divine sense.

He was holding the soul stone in his hand, so the divine sense had not attacked him yet.

If he were to be detected without the Jee family’s bloodline, he wondered what kind of attack this divine sense would launch against him.

He instantly retreated from this space and did not attempt to get any closer.

With the help of the soul stone, he returned to the Azure Ridge Continent.

“How is it? Did you get the things inside?”

Ji Yue asked curiously.

“I’ve obtained everything, but there’s still a holy sword. The ancestor of the Jee family seems to be there still, so I don’t dare to approach it.”

As Qin Yu spoke, he picked up the Ji family members and walked toward the Azure Firmament Sect.

“Is this the Azure Firmament Sect?”

“Under such circumstances, I feel that I need to build my own base. That way, when the alien races attack, I will have a place to defend myself.”

Qin Yu said after thinking for a moment. Wang Feng was now a genuine formation master.

Coupled with the formation information left behind by his father as well as the vast amount of spirit essence…

With Wang Feng’s strength, he could set up a world-destroying formation. This way, everyone would have a place to rest.

Although the Sumeru ring was safe, compared to the immensely vast continent, it was still much narrower.

“Wang Feng, can you set up a formation here now? I want to build a safe base here. Judging from the current situation, the spatial rift will only get bigger. We can’t count on the people from the Holy Region in Solitary Cloud City. We can only rely on ourselves if a powerful alien race descends.”

Qin Yu had already sensed something wrong. If the turbulent times truly descended, their strength alone would be as insignificant as dust.

However, if they gathered together, their chances of survival would increase.

Just like the aristocratic families of the Holy Region. If it weren’t for the fact that their respective families had accumulated over tens of thousands of years, how would they have so many top-notch martial artists?

“Alright, if I have sufficient time, I’m confident that I can set up a formation that even the power of the tribulation can’t break.”
