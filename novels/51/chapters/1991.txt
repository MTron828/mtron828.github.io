1992 Unprecedented

At this moment, Qin Yu’s entire body was emitting a blazing Golden Light, and his internal qi was many times stronger than earlier!

Everyone was shocked. They did not know what had happened, and why Qin Yu’s strength had suddenly soared!

“Could it be… He has broken through?” someone exclaimed.

“Impossible! It is impossible!”

!!

“It doesn’t seem like a sign of a breakthrough. It’s probably some kind of powerful technique.”

Qin Yu glared at the several Semi-Saints in front of him. His whole body trembled, and he completely lost his mind.

“I want to kill you all…” Qin Yu said in a trembling voice.

Those Semi-Saints naturally didn’t take Qin Yu seriously. As Semi-Saints, thinking they had touched the cultivation realm of the True Saint, they were naturally feeling proud.

“Hmph! You’re just playing tricks. I don’t know how you’ve healed your injuries, but so what? ” the previous Semi-Saint said coldly.

Following that, he looked at the price and said, “You saw it, did you? He’s courting death. He deserves to die!”

The prince opened his mouth but didn’t know what to say because he didn’t understand the situation.

“What is going on?” the prince asked the elderly man beside him.

The elderly man shook his head, indicating he didn’t know.

“There was no such a technique that one can burst out with more power in a state of extreme anger,” the elderly man said slowly.

The prince didn’t say anything else. The current situation was no longer within his control.

Therefore, he retreated far off with the two elderly men. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The Semi-Saint narrowed his eyes, sneered, and said. “This is terminal lucidity, right? Alright. I’ll kill you then!”

After saying that, the Semi-Saint took the lead for the attack. He held the light in his hand and ruthlessly smashed it toward Qin Yu!

Qin Yu, who had lost his mind, didn’t take this Semi-Saint seriously. Her shining golden fist smashed toward him!

This punch was like a falling meteorite. It was incredibly terrifying. At the instant of contact, the Semi-Saint immediately felt something wrong, but unfortunately, it was too late!

“Boom!”

With a loud explosion, the Semi-Saint’s fist was shattered, and the remaining power forced him back several steps!

Everyone was dumbfounded as if they couldn’t believe what they were seeing.

Qin Yu had sent the Semi-Saint flying with a punch! How could it be?

Although the internal qi of the Semi-Saint was not at its peak, it was still something a Reversion Void Stage cultivator could not resist!

Before the crowd came to their senses, Qin Yu had already arrived!

He clenched his Golden Fist and ruthlessly smashed at the Semi-Saint!

The second punch caused the entire ground to collapse, and the Semi-Saint failed to escape!

His physical body was almost smashed into meat paste by Qin Yu, and blood kept flowing!

Although he still had some remaining internal qi, he had completely lost the ability to resist!

Two punches! He killed a Semi-Saint with two punches!

Such a battle record was unprecedented!

Everyone swallowed their saliva, and their shock was beyond words.

“How… How could it be…”

Someone took the lead to exclaim, and the subsequent discussions surged in like a tide!

Qin Yu looked coldly at the corpse on the ground. “I want you to die. I want you all to be buried with Wen Da.”

The voice was bone-chilling as if it came from hell, terrifying the people.

The Semi-Saint, lying on the ground, wanted to escape, but Qin Yu didn’t give him a chance. He raised his hand and punched him, turning him into meat paste completely.

The remaining Semi-Saints’ expressions were tremendously ugly. Their faces revealed a trace of solemness.

“Something is wrong with this kid,” a Semi-Saint initiated to speak.

“Let’s kill him together. We definitely can’t let him live in this world,” the other Semi-Saint said coldly.

Following that, the five Semi-Saints stepped forward and surrounded Qin Yu.

Their bodies exuded powerful pressure, trying to trap Qin Yu.

However, Qin Yu’s internal qi was incredibly fierce, and the Golden Light was extremely bright. He was fearless, like the Devil Lord who had descended from the sky.

“Go to hell!”

After a loud shout, Qin Yu took the initiative to attack! Each of his punches contained extreme dao techniques and rules. Even a Semi-Saint would not dare to resist it head-on!

The five Semi-Saints attacked at the same time. It was difficult to determine the winner!

They leaped into the void, and several beams of light intertwined with Qin Yu’s Golden Light, making it difficult for people to open their eyes for a while!

Thunderous rumbles sounded non-stop, and everyone was dumbfounded!

A Middle-stage Reversion Void cultivator had managed to kill one of the six Semi-Saints!

Now, he was even fighting against five Semi-Saints at their peak!

This elegant demeanor was unprecedented.

“Qin Yu is now qualified to be a great cultivator at the Tribulation Stage!”

“If he doesn’t die, he will definitely become the Tribulation Stage great cultivator!”

...

The prince by the side even said in a low voice, “If there’s a certain fortuitous encounter, he can step into the Immortal Emperor stage.”

In the void, the expressions of the Semi-Saints were ugly. Facing Qin Yu, who was like a wild beast, seemed to be strenuous for them.

“What’s happened to this b*stard? How does he have such terrifying battle prowess?”

“Even the holy Son can’t have such combat strength!

“We must get rid of him today no matter what. Everyone, use your trump cards and kill him quickly!”

The several Semi-Saints panicked. They didn’t dare to hold back and planned to kill Qin Yu with all their might!

However, at this moment, a purple light rushed over and forced a Semi-Saint back!

The person who had come was none other than Jue Wu, who had come to her senses!

She stood beside Qin Yu and glared at the few people, shouting, “You old geezers, five against one! Don’t you have any shame!”

Seeing Jue Wu rush back, the five Semi-Saints’ expressions became even uglier.

“Finally, she managed to rush back,” someone said in a low voice.

...

“What a pity. In this case, I’m afraid it’s impossible to kill Qin Yu today.”

“I don’t know what’s happened to Qin Yu. This power doesn’t seem like his, but I’m sure it won’t last long.”

“Let’s retreat first.”

These Semi-Saints had come to an agreement and immediately turned to leave.

They entered the void and wanted to escape.

However, at this moment, Qin Yu’s punch shattered the void and knocked out all the Semi-Saints!

“Qin Yu, don’t go too far!” the Semi-Saint was furious.

Qin Yu’s face was as cold as ice. He looked at the few people coldly and said, “I want all of you to be buried with Wen Da.”

“We didn’t kill that so-called Wen Da. You should look for Gu Xinghe!” one of the Semi-Saints shouted.

“I’ll look for him after I kill you all,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Jue Wu didn’t say a thing. As long as Qin Yu mentioned fighting, she would do it without hesitation.

Therefore, Jue Wu immediately took out her Glided Rake and stood beside Qin Yu.

The purple and golden light mirrored and added radiance and beauty to each other. They looked like the radiance of death.
