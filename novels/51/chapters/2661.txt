Chapter 2662: Travelling to the Demon Sealing Valley

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

He had only been here for less than ten days, but there was a profound sense of time and experience as if he had lived through ages.

It felt like he had arrived here a very long time ago, a sensation of weariness and age in his soul.

Qin Yu looked at the ancient bronze door slowly closing behind him, his expression complex.

Even though he had only been affected by the internal qi, the impact was significant.

The backlash from using Zhuang Zhou’s Dream Butterfly must have been even greater. It was no wonder he had felt so weak just now.

“Did you succeed?” Jing Xin and Ling’er were already waiting at the door.

Upon seeing Qin Yu emerge, Ling’er asked curiously.

Qin Yu nodded slightly. He had completely let down his guard against these two young girls.

“Qin Yu, Master has already instructed us to lead you to the Treasure Repository Pavilion. With Master’s Dao points, you should be able to choose anything you want. However, be careful not to offend elder MO Wendao, who guards the Treasure Repository Pavilion. He has the greatest authority there.

Even with enough Dao points, if he shakes his head, nothing can be taken out.”

Jing Xin explained.

“He’s very strict with outsiders. Many who have entered the Treasure Repository Pavilion have come out with serious injuries or damaged foundations. We were going to pick out a suitable Dharma Treasure for you, but Master refused. Perhaps Master has her reasons.”

“Qin Yu, you have to be careful. Elder MO Wendao doesn’t even give a face to the valley master. His strength seems to surpass Master’s, so you must be polite and avoid angering him. It’s okay if you don’t pick anything.”

Ling’er expressed her concern. The outcomes for previous outsiders had not been favorable.

“Understood. Thank you for informing me. I’m curious, why does Elder MO Wendao target outsiders like this?”

Qin Yu was feeling a bit troubled. It seemed like every place here was difficult to navigate.

“I’m not entirely sure, but there’s a rumor that Elder MO Wendao once took in an outsider as his disciple. He invested a lot in nurturing that person, but they betrayed the Demon Sealing Valley and joined forces with the ancient demons to attack him. He almost died in the Ancient Demon Realm. However, rumors are often unreliable. What’s certain is that elder MO Wendao harbors no goodwill towards outsiders.”

Jing Xin shared what she knew, preparing Qin Yu for what to expect.

“The Treasure Repository Pavilion is a bit of a distance from here. Brother Qin Yu, would you like to join us on a tour of the Demon Sealing Valley?”

Ling’er asked with a smile. Her recent interactions with Qin Yu had made her more comfortable around him, and she was no longer as cautious as before. “Alright, I appreciate the offer, Miss Ling’er.”

“This is our outermost territory, where mostly inner and outer sect disciples reside, along with various elders cultivating. It includes renowned places for practice within the sect, such as the Treasure Repository Pavilion and the Medicine Refinery Pavilion. This vast area represents the strongest combat capabilities of the Demon Sealing Valley.”

“What a large place!” Qin Yu remarked, using his Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze to gauge the size of the Demon Sealing Valley, truly befitting one of the oldest sects in the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom.

“If we don’t utilize artifacts, it’s likely to take us at least ten years to thoroughly explore the Demon Sealing Valley,” Xin Yue commented with a smile, producing three talismans.

With a wave of her hand, she lifted the restrictions on the talismans. Three streams of energy emerged and attached to the backs of the trio.

“The Wings of Clear Winds. With these wings, our speed will increase by more than thirty times, saving us a considerable amount of time.”

Qin Yu observed, feeling the energy behind him and marveling at the profundity of the Saint Kingdom.

Since entering the Saint Kingdom, Qin Yu’s greatest realization was the profoundness of the way, far surpassing those of the lower realms.

Whether it was the skills stored within the Heart of the Saint Kingdom, the magical artifacts, or the powers comprehended by cultivators, some could only be described as fantastical. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The movement techniques of the Demon Sealing Valley, such as Ling Bo, Fleeing Shadow, and Ethereal Movement Technique, were unmatched even by the most elite immortal scriptures of the lower realm’s aristocratic families.

Qin Yu speculated silently that this might be related to the origin of the divine soul.

Back in the lower realm, Qin Yu believed his divine soul to be among the most advanced.

But upon entering the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom, all they could leave behind were divine souls.

Moreover, they were practically at the bottom of the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom’s hierarchy. Only when Qin Yu’s divine soul reached a certain level could they perceive the power of the rules here.

Therefore, Qin Yu now had a faint suspicion that perhaps their limitations were due to the power of the divine soul origin.

The extent of their soul power in the lower realm was such that they were unable to create such profound cultivation method or comprehend even more powerful rules.

It was only after undergoing the baptism of Saint Power that the power of their souls had been strengthened enough to bring about such a change.

Suddenly, the sound of battle interrupted Qin Yu’s thoughts. They had passed through an area where an intense battle was taking place. From the looks of it, there were casualties among the disciples of the Demon Sealing Valley.

“Why is there an ancient demon here?” Qin Yu was somewhat surprised.

“This is a training ground within the Demon Sealing Valley. Valley Master Dan captured ancient demons and sealed them in fixed areas. There are hundreds of such areas in the Demon Sealing Valley, divided into different levels of danger. Sect disciples have to regularly undergo training there. Although there are casualties, it’s much better than the Ancient Demon Land. Additionally, there are some ancient demons not restricted by the regions. They roam freely throughout the Demon Sealing Valley and can attack sect members at any time,” Ling’er explained.

“Within the sect, the most feared thing is complacency. Bringing the ancient demon lord into the sect… Your Valley Master has quite the audacity.” Qin Yu gasped, realizing it was akin to placing a time bomb within the sect.

Using such a method to compel progress within the sect required a level of courage not possessed by ordinary individuals.

“Yes. Although many lost their lives to these ancient demons each year, Valley

Master Dan’s decision has proven correct throughout the history of the Demon Sealing Valley. For so many years, everyone in the sect has cultivated fervently, never daring to slacken. In the face of the Ancient Demon Land, they have managed to firmly suppress these violent creatures. If not for this unexpected turn of events, the Demon Sealing Valley would likely have continued in peace,” Jing Xin sighed.

“Senior Sister Jing Xin, let’s set this aside for now. Allow me to introduce this place to Brother Qin Yu. Beyond these regions lies the central area, the secular land of the Demon Sealing Valley, where nations exist alongside numerous small towns and factions..”
