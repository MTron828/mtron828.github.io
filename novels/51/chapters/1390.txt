Chapter 1391: Chapter 1,391, send him on his way! 1

At this moment, boss Zheng was extremely flustered. He didn’t even know what he should do.

On one side was his relative, and on the other side was the woman he loved deeply. He didn’t know whether to snitch or pretend that he didn’t know.

“Maybe... maybe I heard wrong...”boss Zheng muttered softly.

He hesitated and finally decided to keep it a secret.

At this moment, sister Lin had already walked into the shop with Qin Yu.

Under the dim light, Qin Yu could see many treasures on the counter.

However, these treasures were different from the ones outside. They looked extremely rare and some were even useless.

“Brother Dao,”sister Lin walked forward and called out with a smile.

Under the candlelight, Qin Yu saw the figure of a man.

There was a scar on his face, and his entire body emitted an extremely gloomy aura.

The Man Called Brother Dao Glanced at Qin Yu coldly, then slowly stood up and walked towards Qin Yu.

“You are that Qin Yu?”Brother Dao asked.

Qin Yu didn’t expect Brother Dao to know her identity, so she couldn’t help but be stunned.

“Brother Dao, he is Qin Yu,”sister Lin said quickly.

Brother Dao didn’t say anything and just kept looking at Qin Yu.

This gaze made Qin Yu feel a little scared.

The Brother Dao in front of her seemed to have crawled out of Hell, which made people feel extremely uncomfortable.

“Brother Dao, what’s Wrong?”Sister Lin stepped forward to mediate the situation. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Brother Dao said coldly, “There’s someone.”

“What?”Sister Lin was stunned.

Brother Dao pointed to the door and said, “Didn’t you notice that someone was following you?”

As soon as he said that, sister Lin and Qin Yu’s expressions changed!

The two of them rushed to the door at the same time!

When the door opened, they saw that boss Zheng was planning to escape.

Sister Lin frowned slightly. She stretched out her palm and suddenly pressed forward.

The space where boss Zheng was was instantly collapsed, and boss Zheng’s body was also frozen in place.

“Boss Zheng, how could it be you?”Sister Lin walked forward with an ugly expression.

“Didn’t I tell you to wait for us in the Inn?”

Boss Zheng gritted his teeth and said, “I heard it all. This kid is Qin Yu! He is an enemy of the Tianyun sect!”

Before sister Lin and Qin Yu could speak, a huge hand suddenly burst out from the single horse building!

This hand directly grabbed boss Zheng and brought him into the room.

“Come in.”Brother Dao’s voice came from the room.

Qin Yu and sister Lin exchanged a glance and hurriedly followed him in.

The door slammed shut, and the originally dim room lit up.

Boss Zheng stood there uneasily. He stared at sister Lin and said with some sadness, “Why didn’t you tell me he was Qin Yu...”

Sister Lin’s face was also very ugly. She couldn’t help but curse, “Are you stupid? ! Why, why did you have to...”

Why did you have to say it? wasn’t it good to pretend not to hear it?

“It seems that you already know,”Brother Dao said coldly.

Boss zheng nodded and said, “I’ve been following you all the way. I’ve heard everything you said.”

“Since that’s the case, then I can’t let you stay,”said Brother Dao coldly.

Boss Zheng’s face immediately turned a little pale. He looked at sister Lin with a trembling voice and said, “You... You Want to kill me?”

Sister Lin opened her mouth but didn’t know what to say for a moment.

Of course, she didn’t want to kill boss Zheng, but boss Zheng was a relative of the great elder. What would happen if he heard it?

“I’ll send you on Your Way.”Brother Dao walked toward boss Zheng step by step.

Boss Zheng fought like a sieve and didn’t dare to say a word.

Brother Dao raised his palm and said coldly, “Learn to be smarter in your next life.”

“Wait!”

At this moment, sister Lin suddenly shouted and stopped brother Dao.

Brother Dao frowned and said, “What?”

Sister Lin bit her lips and said, “Let me talk to him.”

Brother Dao snorted and said, “There are so many things to do. Hurry up and don’t waste time.”

Sister Lin walked quickly to boss Zheng. She stared at boss Zheng and said, “You... why do you have to follow me? Didn’t I say that tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow, I can accompany you to the ghost market. You...”

“I’m going to die, so don’t lecture me,”boss Zheng said bitterly.

Sister Lin opened her mouth, the pain on her face was hard to hide.

“You will be sad too, right?”Boss Zheng said with a smile.

“I. . . You... You Idiot!”Sister Lin was angry and sad.

“Okay, stop talking nonsense. It’s time to send him on his way.”Brother Dao interrupted sister Lin and walked quickly to boss Zheng.

Brother Dao held the light in his hand. The light turned into an ice-cold sharp blade and headed straight for boss Zheng.

“Don’t worry. It Won’t hurt,”said Brother Dao coldly.

Boss Zheng closed his eyes as if he was waiting for the death sentence.

Brother Dao didn’t say any more nonsense. The long blade in his hand came toward boss Zheng!

At this moment, a hand suddenly stretched out and blocked in front of boss Zheng.

It was none other than Qin Yu.

Brother Dao frowned and asked, “What are you doing?”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Brother Dao, he followed us all the way and knew my identity, but he didn’t run away. Instead, he followed us all the way. This is enough to prove that he won’t snitch.”
