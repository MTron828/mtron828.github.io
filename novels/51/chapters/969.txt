Chapter 970: Chapter 970, the body belongs to me!

Upon hearing Qin Yu’s words, veins bulged on tie Dan’s forehead.

He suppressed his anger and said, “Am I talking about crying or not? Can’t you fucking grasp the main point?”

“Alright, Alright, cut the crap.”Qin Yu waved his hand. “Wait here. When I’m in a good mood, I’ll let you out.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and was about to leave.

Tie Dan frowned. “What, are you planning to leave me here?”

Qin Yu smiled. “Or what?”

“Kid, you better not cause trouble. If you force me, I’ll destroy this Space Artifact!”Tie Dan said with a gloomy face.

Qin Yu sneered. “I’m afraid you don’t have that ability, right? I’ve investigated it long ago. This isn’t a space artifact at all. It’s a cage specially made for you.”

Tie Dan’s expression instantly changed slightly.

It was obvious that Qin Yu was right. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Alright, even if I can’t destroy this spatial artifact, it’s not a problem for me to destroy your things!”Tie Dan shouted loudly.

After throwing out these words, he rushed towards the treasures placed within Qin Yu’s spatial artifact.

Qin Yu frowned slightly, and he hurriedly chased after him.

“Don’t do anything rash, or else I’ll use the Silver Hoop Curse,”Qin Yu warned.

However, tie Dan completely ignored him.

His spiritual sense was extremely powerful, and it could already turn into a physical form. Just the power of his spiritual sense alone could destroy Qin Yu’s treasures in storage!

Just as Qin Yu was about to use the silver hoop curse, tie Dan suddenly stopped.

He stared at the two corpses in front of him and said with a frown, “What are these? Two sentences... of the return to void tier corpses?”

“Return to void tier?”Qin Yu scratched his head.

“I always thought that these were the corpses of mighty figures. I didn’t expect them to be of the return to void tier.”

Tie Dan said with a gloomy face, “Why do you have the corpses of the return to void tier?”

“Oh, by chance,”Qin Yu said perfunctorily.

Tie Dan’s face was still gloomy. No one knew what he was thinking about.

“If you are willing, I can give you this virtual entity’s corpse,”Qin Yu said with a faint smile.

Tie Dan snorted, “I can’t control this kind of corpse. You’d better keep it for yourself.”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “Alright, then you’d better stay here obediently. Don’t worry, I’ll let you out soon.”

After saying this, Qin Yu walked out of the space artifact.

He suddenly opened his eyes and calculated the time. There were less than two days left until the day of the martial arts discussion hall.

Qin Yu opened the martial arts forum and saw that many people had already sent out photos of the martial arts discussion hall.

“It seems that quite a number of people have left,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Then, Qin Yu took out his phone and called Xia Hang.

After the call was connected, Qin Yu asked, “Is it convenient to talk now?”

Xia hang on the other end smiled bitterly and said, “It’s convenient. I’m just an idler now. It’s convenient at any time.”

Qin Yu could not help but sigh and said, “I didn’t expect Gu Xinghe to act like this.”

Xia hang waved his hand and said, “If you have anything to ask, just ask.”

Qin Yu grunted and said, “Do you know the purpose of Gu Xinghe setting up some martial arts discussion hall?”

Xia Hang said in a deep voice, “No one knows about this matter. Not even long mei, Zhai Xing, and the others beside Gu Xinghe know nothing about it, let alone me.”

“Even they don’t Know?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown slightly.

“But...”at this time, Xia hang suddenly changed the topic.

“Recently, Tian Xuehong came to Jingdu martial arts association. This matter is very likely to be done by Tian Xuehong,”Xia Hang said.

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed!

Tian Xuehong did it?

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “I got it.”

After hanging up the phone, Qin Yu’s expression was extremely gloomy.

Qin Yu had seen Tian Xuehong’s methods before. His goal was to devour everyone’s spiritual sense.

He had failed the last time he went to prison. This time, he probably planned to do it again.

“Damn it, this sky blood rainbow...”Qin Yu couldn’t help but clench his teeth.

After the previous defeat, this time, the Sky Blood Rainbow would definitely bring the white bone army to help.

With Qin Yu’s ability alone, he definitely couldn’t stop the Sky Blood Rainbow.

“I originally wanted to temporarily lock tie Dan in the space artifact. Now it seems like... I can’t do it.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu’s mind moved, and he directly released iron egg from the spatial artifact.

After a flash of light, Iron Egg’s spiritual sense appeared in front of Qin Yu.

Looking at the surrounding environment, Iron Egg was first stunned, then he said with excitement and disbelief, “I... I came out?”

“Hahahaha, I came out!”Iron Egg’s unbridled laughter shook people’s ears until they hurt.

Qin Yu covered his ears and waved his hand, “Alright, stop shouting.”

Tie Dan’s eyes suddenly looked at Qin Yu and said with a faint smile, “Can I enter your body now?”

Qin Yu did not answer but asked, “Is this your primordial spirit? If it’s the primordial spirit, I’m afraid I can’t bear it.”

“What’s the difference between the primordial spirit and the spiritual sense?”Tie Dan snorted coldly.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and hurriedly asked, “What do you mean? Could it be that the primordial spirit cultivated by a martial saint is spiritual sense?”

“It seems that you don’t know anything,”tie Dan said with some disdain.

“Hurry up and say it. Don’t talk nonsense!”Qin Yu said impatiently.

Tie Dan snorted coldly and said, “I’ll tell you after I enter your body.”

“Tell me now,”Qin Yu said with a dark face.

Although tie Dan was unhappy, he still held back his anger and explained in order to get Qin Yu’s body, “The primordial spirit is a stronger spiritual sense. Marquis Wu cultivates the golden core in his dantian, and martial saint cultivates the primordial spirit in his spiritual sense.”

“When you step into the nascent soul realm, your spiritual sense will turn into the nascent soul, commonly known as the primordial spirit.”

Qin Yu hurriedly asked, “Then the stronger my spiritual sense is, the stronger the nascent soul after stepping into the martial saint realm will be, right?”

“That’s the reason,”tie Dan said impatiently.

“Can you let me Enter Your Body Now?”

Qin Yu was deep in thought. After a moment, he nodded and said, “Come.”

After he finished speaking, Qin Yu slightly closed his eyes. A light that looked like an entrance appeared between his brows.

Tie Dan’s face was gloomy. With a flash of his spiritual sense, he directly entered Qin Yu’s body.

“Boy, your body is mine!”Iron Egg’s face showed waves of madness.
