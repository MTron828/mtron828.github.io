The door was suddenly pushed open, and the people in the office immediately turned to look over.

“Who let you in... Qin Yu?” Before the two brawny men could finish their words, their expressions suddenly changed!

Not far away, Mr. Yang anxiously shouted, “Mr. Qin, save me...”

Qin Yu looked at the two brawny men coldly. “Who told you to do this? Lei Hu?”

The two strong men had already been scared to death. They stood there trembling while unable to say a word.

“Looks like there’s no need to ask you guys.” Qin Yu waved his hand and smashed the heads of the two men!

Following that, Qin Yu walked to Mr. Yang’s side and frowned. “Lei Hu betrayed us?”

Mr. Yang hurriedly stood up from the ground and shook his head. “No, it’s Xiong Yi! After he heard that you were captured, he captured Lei Hu and forced me to make medicine for them...”

“Xiong Yi... it’s Xiong Yi again!” Qin Yu was immediately burning with fury!

Last time, he didn’t kill him. Not only did he not know how to restrain himself, but he even became even more vicious!

Even Lei Hu suffered under his hands!

“Where is Xiong Yi now?” Qin Yu said coldly.

Mr. Yang said, “I don’t know either...”

“Then what about Lei Hu?” Qin Yu hurriedly asked.

“Lei Hu is locked in a warehouse in the western suburbs,” Mr. Yang said.

Qin Yu nodded and turned to leave.

At this time, Mr. Yang hurriedly stopped Qin Yu and said, “Mr. Qin, Xiong Yi found a master from God knows where. You... you have to be careful!”

“Master?” Qin Yu sneered.

Even Jiang Gu, who was known as the number one in Chuzhou, was defeated by him. Who else could Qin Yu fear?

“I understand, Mr. Yang. Don’t worry.” Qin Yu nodded.

Then, Qin Yu drove to the warehouse in the western suburbs.

The western suburbs were a wasteland. Because the neighboring cities in the western suburbs weren’t developed, this land had always been desolated

Rumor had it that many fights in Jiangcheng in the early years were in the western suburbs.

Soon, Qin Yu drove to the western suburbs.

On a piece of barren land, there was an empty warehouse.

At the door of the warehouse, there stood a few strong men.

Qin Yu took a closer look and found that these strong men were Lei Hu’s former subordinates. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“These people are really fence-sitters,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Hiss!”

The car came to a sudden stop at the door of the warehouse!

The few people in charge of guarding the warehouse immediately looked over.

“Who are you?!” The few of them shouted.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He just waved his hand, and a wave of energy sent them flying!

Then, Qin Yu walked to the door.

The door of the warehouse was locked by a big lock. Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and suddenly smashed the lock into two halves!

With a loud bang, the door was smashed open by Qin Yu!

The two of them hurriedly walked in.

They saw that there were many herbs in the warehouse. What surprised Qin Yu was that these herbs weren’t of low age!

The highest was even close to a hundred years!

“Huh? What an unexpected harvest.” Qin Yu touched his chin and muttered softly.

It seemed Xiong Yi had long been prepared. He actually prepared so many herbs in advance.

But... where did he get these herbs from?

Qin Yu didn’t think too much about it. Instead, he walked into the warehouse.

In the center of the warehouse, a man covered in blood was tied up like a dog.

His entire body was covered in wounds. His appearance couldn’t even be seen clearly.

“Lei Hu?” Qin Yu called out tentatively.

Hearing this voice, the man on the ground suddenly raised his head!

When he saw Qin Yu’s face clearly, he immediately burst into tears!

“Mr. ... Mr. Qin... you’re finally here...” Lei Hu couldn’t stop crying. He no longer had his usual demeanor.

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely cold. He stretched out his hand and broke the chain.

Then, he placed his palm on Lei Hu’s chest, and a gush of spiritual energy gushed out.

In just ten minutes, Lei Hu felt that more than half of his injuries had healed.

Looking at the crying Lei Hu, Qin Yu berated, “Hold back your tears!”

After he heard the stern shout, Lei Hu hurriedly covered his mouth.

“What exactly happened?” Qin Yu asked coldly.

Ruthlessness flashed in Lei Hu’s eyes.

He immediately told Qin Yu what had happened.

“After Xiong Yi found out that you were captured, he robbed the factory. More than half of my men followed Xiong Yi.” Lei Hu took a deep breath and forcefully suppressed his anger.

Qin Yu’s expression was somewhat cold.

He looked at Lei Hu and said, “Where is Xiong Yi now?”

Lei Hu hurriedly said, “He set up a Chamber of Commerce in Jiangcheng. At this time, he should be in the Chamber of Commerce.”

“Bring me there,” Qin Yu said.

“Okay!” Lei Hu hurriedly nodded.

The three of them left the warehouse and rushed toward the Chamber of Commerce under Lei Hu’s guidance.

On the way, Lei Hu told Qin Yu that almost all the merchants were with Xiong Yi now.

In other words, currently, Xiong Yi almost controlled the entire economic lifeline of Jiangcheng!

Even the Lu family, the former richest family in Jiangcheng, was far inferior to the current Xiong Yi!

“Xiong Yi...” Viciousness flashed in Qin Yu’s eyes.

The car soon arrived at a chinese-style villa by the river.

It had to be said that the environment of this villa was quite beautiful. The huge courtyard had mountains, rivers, and pavilions.

“Xiong Yi sure knows how to enjoy himself,” Qin Yu said coldly.

In the courtyard, under a pavilion, more than ten men in suits were sitting together and sipping tea.

And the one sitting at the front was Xiong Yi.

“Mr. Xiong, it was thanks to your prompt decision that we could have such an opportunity!”

“Yeah, we have disliked Lei Hu since long before!”

“Thank you, Mr. Xiong, for giving us such a lucrative opportunity!”

Everyone’s flattery made Xiong Yi even more elated.

He waved his hand and said indifferently, “Don’t worry. As long as I have a bite to eat, you guys won’t lack it either.”

“Thank you, Mr. Xiong!” Everyone flattered again.

At this moment, someone at the side suddenly said, “Mr. Xiong, there’s a rumor outside saying Qin Yu didn’t die and that the Jiang family even admitted defeat. I don’t know if it’s true.”

Upon hearing this, Xiong Yi’s expression changed slightly.

“It’s impossible, right?” Xiong Yi said suspiciously.

“I also think it’s impossible. They even said that the Jiang family has already submitted to Qin Yu. However, I’ve checked and the people in the provincial capital don’t know about this matter at all.”

Upon hearing this, Xiong Yi immediately burst into laughter.

When he heard thst Qin Yu wasn’t dead, Xiong Yi was still a little worried.

But to say that the Jiang family had submitted to Qin Yu? Wasn’t that nonsense?

“Clearly, someone is spouting nonsense.” Xiong Yi snorted lightly.

“The Jiang family is a family that had been established for hundreds of years. How can Qin Yu deal with them alone?”

“Moreover, even if Qin Yu isn’t dead, what can he do? Little Wu can deal with him as he pleases!”

Little Wu immediately took a step forward and nodded. “Don’t worry. If Qin Yu is really not dead, I will go and kill him.”
