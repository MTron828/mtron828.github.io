Chapter 2610: The Choice

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

There must be a price to pay for being able to summon so many necromancy armies, even Seifer, such a formidable necromancer.

Moreover, his true body should be frail, and there were many powerful internal qi around his true body.

Black dragons, necromancy knights, and skeleton archers; these powerful forces were all gathered around him.

The ogre was only a second -grade monster beast. If they wanted to fight, they had to bring forward the date again. Seifer should be in his weakest condition now.

Li Yue stared at the light spot that entered the chessboard and muttered to himself.

Something was wrong.

Li Yue’s expression suddenly changed.

He took out a Spirit Recovery Pill and swallowed it.

As his power of the soul recovered, the chessboard kept changing in his hand. It kept expanding in a specific place, blurring and then becoming clear again.

“Another outsider?”

Lu Yue’s expression was a little solemn. A weak internal qi suddenly entered the chessboard.

As the internal qi entered, the entire chessboard suddenly turned pitch-black. Densely packed black chess pieces covered the whole chessboard without white pieces on top.

It was a deadlocked position.

Li Yue’s expression changed drastically, and he retreated almost without hesitation.

Less than two seconds after he left, a living being suddenly appeared where he was. He stared in the direction Li Yue had left and revealed a strange smile.

“It’s not simple. He could actually sense my existence. This ability doesnt seem to be a simple Order of Rules. It seems to be a skill of the Heart of Saint

Kingdom.”

The living being that appeared let out a hollow voice. It did not chase after Li Yue, who had left. Instead, it went deep into the core of this area.

He slowly entered it, and inside, numerous necromancy armies stood orderly in various areas.

There were a skeleton archer army, a necromancy knight army, and five black dragons.

Compared to the ogre’s chaotic scene, these were the real armies of Seifer.

These armies looked at the newcomer, and not only did they not show hostility but bowed slightly instead.

“Ross, the chosen one by Saint Zi Yang’s divine flame. Why did you come here, and what is your motive?”

A giant wizard sat on the throne. The light of the ghostly fire flickered in its withered pupils. At this moment, it stared at the figure, showing a look of doubt.

“Saint Supreme Zi Yang has said that human nature can’t defeat the demonic nature. This is destined by the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom. Even a fake victory will give humanity false hope. The reason I’m here is to destroy the hope of the human race completely.”

Ross chuckled and said.

“Lord Seifer, please don’t worry. I’ve already accepted your invitation. The human race might not necessarily lose the final battle completely. They are looking for all kinds of opportunities, but the power of necromancy will eventually crush this city and descend on the entire Saint Kingdom. Isn’t Lord Seifer’s powerful strength proof of this?”

Seifer nodded and stopped speaking.

“Lord, another scout team has appeared in one of the passages. Should we kill them?”

Ross said softly.

“It’s fine. You just stay by my side and protect me. You don’t have to worry unless they come to this area. Once my soul recovers, we can lead the army to launch a direct attack, completely flatten Nine Tune City.”

Seifer’s finger pointed at a black dragon, and the black dragon seemed to have received an order.

With a flap of its wings, it soared into the sky.

At this moment, Qin Yu and the others were caught in a fierce battle.

The ogres and giant ogres were no longer a serious threat to them.

However, once they were surrounded, they would probably be completely wiped out by this terrifying army. Therefore, they had forcefully rushed out of the encirclement of the ogres after the battle.

Ju Wuwei, alone with his saber, was at the forefront clearing the path, while Fang Xiang, Liu Da, and Shen Qian provided support by the side.

Ju Wuwei’s body moved like a ghost amidst the blade light, once again cutting off the head of another ogre.

He breathed lightly and then stepped back slightly.

Holding an enormous axe, Liu Da, who was also holding a Vajra Sword, was in front.

Qin Yu, on the other hand, was in the middle, observing the situation around him. His face was also somewhat pale.

The Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze consumed a lot of mental strength. If his soul had not been strengthened after the first city defense battle and he had not been taking the Spirit Recovery Pill, he probably would not have been able to hold on.

With the strengthening after the previous battle, the ogres and giant ogres were no longer a threat to them. They would not be in any danger as long as they were not surrounded.

Seife had also launched a mental attack previously, so they would not be in any danger for the time being.

“Ju Wuwei, your physical body doesn’t seem to have improved much, but your combat strength has increased by at least three times.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Ju Wuwei had already killed eight giant ogres since the start of the battle, and he was still doing it with ease.

It had been an extremely exaggerated battle record. In the first battle of defending the city, just killing one ogre had exhausted almost all of his strength.

“I entered the Way in the mortal realm with my saber, and the Way was almost my life. I know exactly which muscle I use and where I exert force from when I wield my saber. Therefore, when strengthening, I focus on these areas and supplement the other parts to maximize the power of my saber.”

Ju Wuwei said softly. Qin Yu was the person Elder Tianji had mentioned, so he did not hide anything from Qin Yu.

Qin Yu nodded. This was practically using all his strength on the blade.

The other areas that were not needed for the battle were directly ignored. This was the best method in the current situation where Saint Power was so precious. No wonder Ju Wuwei’s improvement was so amazing.

All of a sudden, an extremely mournful voice sounded near them.

“That’s the voice of the black dragon. Could it be that something has happened to the black dragon?”

Ju Wuwei said with a frown.

The black dragon was derived from the corpses of countless giant ogres, ogres, and humans. Its strength was at least four to five times that of the giant ogres, and its flying ability was almost unrivaled.

Seeing it let out such a terrifying scream, Qin Yu hesitated a while before rushing in that direction.

“I’m going over to take a look. You decide for yourself whether to follow me or retreat!”

Now that they had lost the necromancy candle in Li Yue’s hand, it was unrealistic for them to go deep in.

However, the information they had gathered should not be of high value. If they wanted to enter the bunker and find the living being that Elder Tianji had mentioned, they should not have enough merit points.

Qin Yu did not want to miss this rare opportunity.

He would not gain much this time by retreating directly.

Shen Qian and Ju Wuwei followed behind him without hesitation. Fang Xiang and Liu Da hesitated for a while and did not follow him. Instead, they retreated toward the tunnel..
