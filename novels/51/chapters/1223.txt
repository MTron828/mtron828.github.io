Chapter 1224: Chapter 1,224, Purple Jade origin snake 

God’s plan was better than man’s.

No one had expected that someone would accept the order that no one had been interested in.

Qin Yu lowered the brim of his hat and turned around, secretly sizing up the person who had accepted the order.

When he saw the person clearly, his expression couldn’t help but change slightly.

“Jiang Yi?”Qin Yu was extremely surprised in his heart.

He didn’t expect Jiang Yi to appear here and take the list.

“Master, he...”

Di Zun was about to speak but was stopped by Qin Yu.

Jiang Yi didn’t stay any longer. After he took the list, he turned around and left.

Because Qin Yu covered his face and there was no spiritual energy fluctuation in his body, he didn’t attract Jiang Yi’s attention.

After he walked far away, Di Zun couldn’t help but ask, “Master, why didn’t you teach him a lesson?”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, then he sighed slightly and said, “I know this person.”

“You... Yoow Him?”Di Zun was even more confused.

Qin Yu waved his hand and didn’t explain further.

When Jiang Yi left in a bad mood back then, he put all his hatred on Qin Yu.

There was bound to be a huge battle between the two of them, and it was unavoidable.

At this moment, the sky had gradually darkened.

And the Purple Jade origin snake was about to come out of its cage.

Di Zun brought Qin Yu to the vicinity of the island Lord’s Manor to register.

There were still quite a number of people who had registered today, a total of eight people.

These eight people were all powerful and possessed unique skills. Only Qin Yu looked rather ordinary.

“Those who have registered, come with me.”

After a short while, a strong man walked out.

Di Zun wanted to follow, but he was mercilessly rejected. He could only buy tickets and sit in the audience seats.

Qin Yu followed behind these people, passing through a long corridor, and finally stopped at the participating seats.

This participating seats were not quite what he had imagined. It was not a cold bench, but rather a banquet.

There was food, drinks, and even entertainment. Everything was available.

There were beautiful women and handsome men. All of these were for the contestants to choose from.

“This is the first time I’ve seen such a participating seat,”Qin Yu could not help but say in surprise.

Hearing this, the person in charge could not help but sneer, “Our Island Lord has a compassionate heart. Before yot off on your journey, we naturally have to satisfy you.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu looked at the other contestants and said, “Yoow that you might die today, so why do yoill participate?”

“Why? Because the conditions are good,”someone said.

“There must be warriors under the heavy money. Isn’t it the same for you?”

Qin Yu wanted to ask what the reward was, but at this moment, cheers came from ode. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Qin Yu, who was not interested in eating, drinking, or having fun, immediately stood up and walked out of the banquet hall.

Standing on the participating seats, Qin Yu could see the tip of the iceberg.

In this huge manor, there was an extremely huge snake.

Its body was emitting a surging purple internal QI, and this internal Qi made it look even more difficult to provoke.

Two fangs shot out from its mouth like long whips, spitting out from time to time.

On the Purple Jade origin snake’s body, there was a golden rope that looked like a collar.

This rope was tightly tied to its neck to prevent the purple jade origin snake from going berserk.

“It’s quite domineering,”Qin Yid sincerely as he looked at the huge purple jade origin snake.

“Hehe, it seems that you are quite cute,”a participant walked out from the side.

This participant had his hands behind his back, looking like a top-notch martial artist. His body emitted a vague internal Qi, making him even more mysterious.

Qin Yiled and said, “This friend seems to be quite confident.”

That participant smiled faintly and said, “My purpose of coming here today is to kill this beast. No one can take it away from me.”

“Oh, then I’ll let you go first.”Qin Yiled and said.

That contestant snorted lightly and said, “No matter who goes first, the ending will be the same. You gare just cannon fodder.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He didn’t understand this contestant, nor did he understand the purple jade origin snake, so he couldn’t jump to a conclusion.

However, this contestant’s every move was indeed quite pretentious.

The atmosphere on the stage became increasingly hot, and many people were cheering.

Amidst the cheers, the island owner of Deer Emperor Island slowly walked out.

He wore a purple robe and had long hair. His body was tall and straight, and there was a faint smile on his face.

However, in this smile, there was a hidden sharpness that people didn’t dare to ignore.

“He is the island owner?”Qin Yu looked at this man who was full of nobility and said in a low voice.

“That’s right. He’s the island owner, Deer Emperor,”a contestant beside him said.

“It’s said that deer emperor is a person who has lived for thonds of years. He opened Deer Emperor Island because he was tired of the secular life.”

Qin Yzed up deer emperor on the stage and was a little surprised.

When Qin Yu was famous throughout the world, he had never heard of this deer emperor.

It seemed that there were many secrets in this world that no one knew about.

Deer Emperor sat in his exclusive seat. Then, he whispered something to the people around him. The person-in-charge immediately jumped into the air and arrived in front of Qin Yu and the others.

The person-in-charge glanced at Qin Yu and the others. Then, he raised his finger and tapped on everyone’s bodies, as if he was giving them numbers.

“Okay, let’s go on stage in this order,”said the person-in-charge.

Qin Yu counted in his head and found that he was the seventh.

As for the pretentious man from before, he was the second.

“Okay, let’s go on stage.”The person-in-charge waved his hand.

The first-ranked player immediately jumped down from the stage and walked toward the purple jade essence snake.

“Another contestant who died in vain,”the pretentious man said indifferently.

Then, he looked at Qin Yu and the others and said, “Yoould thank God for letting yoand behind me.”
