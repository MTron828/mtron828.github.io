1904 Interested in My Body?

Qin Yu looked around and realized all the plants here were rare and precious.

“This place is excellent, but I don’t know if it’s safe,” Qin Yu nodded and said.

“Safe? You’re doubting the safety of the Cold Moon Palace!” Saintess Gu couldn’t help but cover her mouth and chuckle.

Qin Yu also felt he was being ridiculous. This was the Gu family, and the Cold Moon Palace was passed down from their ancestors. Who could come here and cause trouble?

“I was ridiculous.” Qin Yu smiled bitterly.

Saintess Gu shook her head, showing her understanding.

At this time, Qin Yu raised her head and looked at the huge Osmanthus tree.

“Saintess Gu, pardon me for asking. Did anyone cut down this tree in the past? ” Qin Yu tried to ask.

Hearing this, Saintess Gu had a complicated look in her eyes.

She looked at Qin Yu with surprise and vigilance, and said, “How do you know this?”

Qin Yu sensed Saintess Gu’s vigilance and explained, “Saintess Gu, please don’t misunderstand. It’s just that I’ve heard of some legends. The story in the legend is very similar to the Cold Moon Palace.

“Legend? What legend?” Saintess Gu asked.

“It’s another world on the other side of the starry sky,” Qin Yu said after some thought. “I’ll bring you there if there’s a chance in the future.”

Saintess Gu didn’t ask further, but obviously, she still had some doubts.

…

On the following day, Qin Yu came to the Great Hall of the temple again.

The stone table was full of delicacies. Si Shifeng and the others had also arrived.

Qin Yu and Chang Mang took their seats and began to eat without saying anything. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Especially Chang Mang. He was well built, to begin with, and with the way he gobbled down the food, he looked like a wild beast that had been starving for days.

“Hehe! The low-level cultivators eat like animals.” Si Shifeng took the opportunity to mock.

Chang Mang slammed the table and shouted, “What did you say? Are you courting death?”

“What? Has someone admitted the criticism?” Si Shifeng raised his eyebrows.

“Do you believe I’ll kill you?” Chang Mang said with wide eyes.

Qin Yu tugged at Chang Mang, shook his head, and said, “Forget it. Don’t lower yourself arguing with him.”

Chang Mang said angrily, “It’s fine if he referred to me, but he actually referred to you. I can’t stand it!”

Qin Yu was speechless.

The dinner was at the tail end.

At this moment, Saintess Gu suddenly looked at Yan Yunfan and smiled, “Mr. Yan, I have something to discuss with you. I don’t know if it’s convenient.”

Yan Yunfan nodded, signaling Saintess Gu to continue.

Saintess Gu glanced at Qin Yu and said with a smile, “Qin Yu wants to enter the Yan family. What do you think?”

Qin Yu frowned slightly but didn’t say anything.

Yan Yunfan glanced at Qin Yu and laughed, “He? Enter the Yan family? Saintess Gu, are you joking? Let me tell you. As long as I’m still in the Yan family, he can forget about stepping into the family!”

Saintess Gu seemed to have expected this. She smiled and said, “I’m just saying it. Mr. Yan, there’s no need to get angry.”

Qin Yu’s brows furrowed even tighter. For a moment, he could not figure out the meaning of Saintess Gu’s action.

After dinner, Yan Yunfan and Si Shifeng planned to leave the Cold Moon Palace.

“Qin Yu, we should also leave now,” Chang Mang said.

As Qin Yu still needed the help of Saintess Gu, he shook his head and said, “I might have to stay here for a few days. If you have nothing to do, you can stay with me in the Cold Moon Palace.”

“What are you doing here?” Chang Mang frowned and asked.

Qin Yu looked around, pulled Chang Mang to the side, and whispered, “I have to ask Saintess Gu’s help to allow me to get into the Yan family.”

“Oh! You’re going to the Yan family! Then I won’t accompany you,” Chang Mang waved his hand and said.

Qin Yu quickly pulled him back and said, “Then where are you going?”

Chang Mang smiled and said, “The world is so big. I can go anywhere. Speaking of which, I also want to make a living in Zhongzhou.”

Qin Yu knew it would be very difficult to bring Chang Mang into the Yan family. Thus he did not stop him.

“I won’t be in the Yan family for long. Let’s meet here after some time,” Qin Yu said to Chang Mang after some thought.

“Sure. No problem!” Chang Mang agreed.

Chang Mang didn’t stay any longer. After thanking Saintess Gu, he left the Cold Moon Palace.

Therefore, only Qin Yu and Saintess Gu were left in the Cold Moon Palace.

After all of them left, Qin Yu went to Saintess Gu’s room.

Saintess Gu’s room was in antique style. It had a scholarly atmosphere.

Saintess Gu was making tea at a mahogany table.

Wisps of fresh air were floating, making Saintess Gu look like a fairy.

Qin Yu took a closer look and found the tea in the teapot to be Enlightenment Tea.

“As expected of the nine great aristocratic families,” Qin Yu said with emotion.

Saintess Gu poured a cup of tea for Qin Yu and said with a smile, “It seems like Mr. Qin has drunk this Enlightenment Tea before.”

...

“Yeah,” Qin Yu said, “I guess so.”

Back then, Enlightenment Tea was extremely rare in the past. The advancement it brought to cultivation was beyond imagination.

But now that he had reached this level of cultivation, the effects of Enlightenment Tea had become negligible.

After taking a cup of tea, Qin Yu went straight to the point, “Saintess Gu, please point me in the right direction. Where should I find the secret technique to conceal my internal qi?”

“That will depend on Mr. Qin’s requirements,” Saintess Gu said with a smile.

“I don’t have any requirements. It’s enough as long as I’m not seen through,” Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

Saintess Gu looked up at Qin Yu. She blinked and said, “You can get from the man with the mustache. This kind of secret skill should be nothing in his hands.”

Qin Yu tensed up. He quickly waved his hand and said, “I don’t know him well. Moreover, I can’t find him.”

Saintess Gu didn’t say anything but fixed her gaze on Qin Yu.

After a while, as if confirming Qin Yu wasn’t lying, Saintess Gu said with a smile, “I can help you ask.”

“Really? Thank you very much, Saintess Gu!” Qin Yu quickly thanked her.

...

“Don’t rush to thank me,” Saint Gu chuckled and said. “If I help you, how do you thank me?”

Qin Yu scratched his head. He thought for a long time but still couldn’t figure out how to answer.

She was the saintess of the Gu family, and she didn’t lack anything. What did Qin Yu have that could catch the eyes of the saintess?

“I don’t know.” After hesitating for a while, Qin Yu laughed bitterly.

Saintess Gu was calm. She poured a cup of tea for Qin Yu and said quietly, “What is Mr. Qin’s advantage?”

“Advantage?” Qin Yu scratched his head. He looked down at his relatively robust body and answered, “My advantage… I’m afraid it’s my steely body.”

At this point, Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly. He looked at Saintess Gu and said in surprise, “You’re not interested in my body, are you?”
