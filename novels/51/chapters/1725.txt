Three against three.

The joining of Wen Wanchong and Qu Zhu undoubtedly changed the tide of the battle.

Their arrival immediately brought the entire Nanzhou to a frenzy.

All the onlookers clenched their fists, and their faces were full of excitement.

“Wen Wanchong and Qu Zhu. They’ve made their move!”

!!

“Qu Zhu has never been weaker than Yong Ji, and Wen Wanchong is also a top-tier existence in Nanzhou! It’s hard to say who will win in today’s battle!”

“I just don’t know if the current Xiao Sheng still has the strength to deal with Yuan Xiu.”

Everyone was well aware that the joining of the two would, at most, free up Xiao Sheng’s hands to deal with Yuan Xiu as they could not defeat Yong Ji and Sima Bei in a short time.

However, with Xiao Sheng’s current poor state, could he still defeat Yuan Xiu?

If Yuan Xiu won, the outcome would still be the same.

“We should believe in Xiao Sheng. He has never been defeated in his life, no matter who he is facing,” someone said.

“He’s only at the half-step Reversion Void Stage. This battle wouldn’t have been so difficult if he was at the Reversion Void Stage!”

“Now that things have come to this, we can only silently pray.”

It was on the battlefield.

Three people were facing three people.

Wen Wanchong’s mouth didn’t stop, and he scolded Yong Ji and the others.

Qu Zhu, on the other hand, looked much calmer. He stood there without saying a word, but his body exuded a cold chill.

The injuries on Xiao Sheng’s body were slowly healing, but his internal qi had not recovered at all.

“Qu Zhu… You actually didn’t die last time.”

At this moment, Yuan Xiu looked in Qu Zhu’s direction.

Qu Zhu nodded slightly and smiled. “I was lucky. I survived.”

Yuan Xiu snorted. “You’re right. You’re really lucky. Since you didn’t die last time, I’ll kill you this time.”

“Cut the crap. Qu Zhu, leave Yong Ji to me. I’ve long since found him an eyesore,” Wen Wanchong said coldly.

“I don’t have any objections,” Qu Zhu said indifferently.

He looked at Sima Bei and chose his opponent.

Three against three. The battle began again.

Xiao Sheng glared at Yuan Xiu coldly. His slightly pale face was filled with killing intent. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Yuan Xiu squinted his eyes to size up Xiao Sheng and sneered. “I know you still have a trump card, but do you think it’ll work? Today, you will die without a doubt.”

As he spoke, Yuan Xiu raised his head and roared, his internal qi erupting once again.

He knew the current Xiao Sheng was in a terrible state, so he would naturally not give Xiao Sheng any chance.

He leaned forward, his left hand forming a palm and his right hand forming a fist. His techniques and physical body had achieved an extreme fusion. He was actually going to fight Xiao Sheng in close combat.

Xiao Sheng’s condition was extremely poor, and he had yet to reach the Reversion Void Stage, so he was naturally no match for Yuan Xiu in close combat.

For a moment, he was forced to retreat and bleed continuously.

A terrifying radiance appeared on Yuan Xiu’s hand.

As his palm fell, half of Xiao Sheng’s body was almost torn into pieces. Blood gushed out, and his white bones were exposed. It was a terrible sight.

Yuan Xiu sneered as he looked at Xiao Sheng, who was lying on the ground. “What right do you have to fight me?”

Xiao Sheng stood up from the ground and spat out a mouthful of blood. His face turned even paler.

He looked at Yuan Xiu and said, “If I don’t die today, do you still have the chance to defeat me? Even if your true body in North Plain is revived, can you defeat me?”

Yuan Xiu was stunned, and a trace of anger flashed across his face.

He said coldly, “I admit that I may not be able to defeat you if you reach the Reversion Void Stage. Not just me. There probably aren’t many Reversion Void Stage cultivators in the world who are confident in defeating you, but so what? You won’t have that chance!”

“You’re wrong.” Xiao Sheng shook his head. “It’s not that you might not be able to defeat me. The reality is that you don’t have the right to fight me.

“As for me not having a chance, you’re wrong too. I won’t die today.”

Yuan Xiu was stunned. He suddenly had a bad feeling.

He said coldly, “You only know how to talk. You’re dead!”

The uneasiness in Yuan Xiu’s heart seemed to have made him even more furious. He waved his fists and used all his techniques to force Xiao Sheng back once again.

On the other hand, Qu Zhu and Wen Wanchong had already begun their battle.

Wen Wanchong had received the true inheritance of Jue Wu, and in the battle, he was completely in a state of fighting with his life on the line. He was like a long-haired madman, extremely terrifying, so it was difficult for Sima Bei to deal with him.

Qu Zhu looked much more elegant, but his attacks were also sharp, making it difficult for Yong Ji to block.

“Qu Zhu, I don’t think we’ve ever fought before,” Yong Ji said coldly.

“Yes.” Qu Zhu nodded slightly. “Today is the first time, and perhaps the last.”

“Arrogant!” Yong Ji shouted as he raised his palm. “I’ll kill you today!”
