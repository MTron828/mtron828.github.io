Chapter 525: Three Dark Energy Graves! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The Jingdu Martial Arts Association was clearly serious.

Three Martial Marquises were enough to wipe out any sect in the world!

Even the so-called number one sect in the north, the Saint Confucian Sect, only had one Martial Marquis overseeing it!

At this moment, Qin Yu didn’t know that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association was already secretly targeting him.

But he knew very clearly that if he couldn’t step into the Martial Marquis realm, he might not be able to return from this journey.

Qin Yu spent a whole four days before finally completely absorbing the dark energy from the first grave.

He sat up from the ground and then shook his arms slightly before spitting out a mouthful of turbid internal qi.

“According to this progress, three such graves are enough to help me step into the Martial Marquis Realm,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Once one stepped into the rank of a Martial Marquis, they would give birth to a Golden Core, and their strength would also experience an unprecedented surge!

A Martial Marquis could practically run amok in the world!

Even top-tier capital families like the Yan family and the Han family couldn’t forcefully order a Martial Marquis to work for them!

“If I can successfully step into the rank of Martial Marquis, when I go to Jingdu this time, I must teach them a lesson!” Qin Yu said coldly.

As long as he could successfully step into the Martial Marquis Realm, Qin Yu would not only be able to take Yan Ruoxue away, but he would also be able to show off his might!

Successfully taking Yan Ruoxue away was only the first step.

Qin Yu had promised Yan Ruoxue that he would definitely let her stand at the highest peak of Jingdu!

Either he would take back the Yan family, or he would establish an even bigger aristocratic family, a truly top-tier sect that was above the Yan family!

“Let’s go.” Qin Yu walked to the man with the mustache.

The man with the mustache agreed and immediately brought Qin Yu to the second Big Grave.

The second Big Grave was located at a certain border in the north.

Just like the previous Big Grave, this place was almost deserted. The atmosphere was cold and uninhabitable.

At a glance, it was frozen for thousands of miles.

The cold wind felt like a sharp blade.

The man with the mustache pointed at an iceberg in front of him and said, “This is the place.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He sat down cross-legged and began to absorb the energy from the second Dark Energy Grave.

Qin Yu spent six whole days at the second Dark Energy Grave.

When he finished absorbing the second Dark Energy Grave, it was already August 27th.

There were only thirteen days left until September 9th!

The intense urgency made Qin Yu somewhat anxious.

“Take me to the third Dark Energy Grave immediately,” Qin Yu said somewhat anxiously.

The man with the mustache immediately brought Qin Yu to the third Dark Energy Grave.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s body was already filled with a large amount of dark energy, and this dark energy would become the foundation for Qin Yu to try to break through to the Martial Marquis Realm.

According to Qin Yu’s calculations, after absorbing the third Dark Energy Grave, he would be able to enter closed door cultivation to try to break through to the Martial Marquis realm.

This was also the fastest method.

The two of them arrived at the third Dark Energy Grave.

However, the scene here made the two of them frown.

They saw that the third Dark Energy Grave had a high wall built, and there were tall buildings rising from the ground.

They could see two big words written on the building: Yi Han.

“Someone set up a company here?” Looking up at the tall building, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

Not only that, but there were also a number of luxury cars parked under the building.

“Strange, why would someone set up a company in such a place?” The man with the mustache touched his chin and whispered.

Qin Yu also felt that it was strange. This kind of place didn’t attract people. If ordinary people lived for a long time, they might even get sick and die.

Who would choose to set up a company in this kind of place?

“Can you still find a fourth Dark Energy Grave?” Qin Yu looked at the man with the mustache and asked.

The man with the mustache rolled his eyes and said, “Do you think Dark Energy Graves are as abundant as cabbages on the street?”

Looking at this building, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

After thinking for a moment, he finally strode in.

After entering the company, Qin Yu found that the people in this building were all as thin as sticks.

“This is the result of swallowing dark energy,” Qin Yu looked around and said in a low voice.

People who cultivated dark energy would usually be as thin as sticks and not in human form.

The reason why this didn’t happen to Qin Yu was that he could absorb dark energy and bright energy at the same time, so that dark energy and bright energy could maintain balance.

Then, Qin Yu released his divine sense and enveloped the entire building.

Soon, Qin Yu found that there were eight Inner Strength Grandmasters and a half-step Martial Marquis in this building! Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“It seems that this isn’t a company,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

The man with the mustache nodded and said, “Well, if I’m not mistaken, this should be a sect.”

After all, it was a modern society, and many sects had headquarters in the form of high-rise buildings.

Even the Saint Confucian Sect was the same.

“It’s said that those who cultivate dark energy are mostly sinister and cunning,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The man with the mustache glanced at Qin Yu and sneered. “Sinister and crafty people? Don’t you cultivate dark energy yourself?”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “I’m different.”

“What’s different about you? It’s just that you stand on different sides,” the man with the mustache said.

“You said that they’re sinister and crafty. That Saint Confucian Sect is known as a righteous sect. Are they good people?”

Qin Yu was instantly speechless. For a moment, he had nothing to say.

“Let’s go.” The nonsense made sense. Qin Yu didn’t say anything else.

Following this divine sense, Qin Yu walked towards the roof.

On the way, Qin Yu could clearly feel that the dark energy was getting denser.

When he arrived at a certain office on the top floor, the dark energy here had already reached its peak.

Qin Yu pushed the door open, only to find that the door was tightly locked, and there was even a restrictive power placed on it.

However, this technique wasn’t even worth mentioning in front of Qin Yu.

He merely used his spiritual energy to break the restrictive power with brute force.

The door slowly opened.

The moment he entered, he saw five people sitting inside the office:

One was a half-step Martial Marquis, and the other four were at the peak of the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm!

They were all as skinny as sticks. Their hair was disheveled and their faces were dirty. Their eyes were deeply sunken, and they looked a little frightening.

At this moment, they were surrounding a black square object.

All the dark energy came from this black square object!

“Who are you?!” After seeing Qin Yu, the half-step Martial Marquis stood up first!

Qin Yu explained, “Everyone, don’t misunderstand. I’m just here to discuss something with everyone.”

“Hmph, we’ve hidden here, but you still don’t want to give up, right? Fine, I want to see how capable you are!” The half-step Martial Marquis shouted loudly, then reached out towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu had no choice but to dodge and explain at the same time.

But unfortunately, this half-step Martial Marquis didn’t listen to anything, and his moves became increasingly fierce!

Qin Yu frowned slightly. If this continued, there was no telling how much time would be wasted

Thus, Qin Yu wrapped his palm with spiritual power and slapped out.

“Boom!”

This half-step Martial Marquis was instantly jolted back, and a mouthful of blood gushed out!

The half-step Martial Marquis wiped the blood at the corner of his mouth and stood up from the ground.

He gritted his teeth and said coldly, “As expected of someone from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. Your strength is indeed extraordinary!”

Qin Yu was instantly stunned.

“Jingdu Martial Arts Association? I’m not a member of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association,” Qin Yu said awkwardly.

“Even if you’re not a member of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, you’re also their lackey!” The half-step Martial Marquis shouted.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown. He was silent for a moment, then said, “A lackey of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association? The Jingdu Martial Arts Association has tried their best to kill me, so how can I become their lackey?”

Before the half-step Marquis could speak, another wave of fierce internal qi came from the door!

Then, four to five people walked in from outside the door.

These people wore white robes. On the white robes, there was the symbol of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

Not only that, but in their hands, there was a Martial Marquis weapon!

“You guys hid yourselves quite well. You actually hid in such a place?” As soon as these people entered the door, they sneered.
