Qin Yu’s face was gloomy as he quickly walked towards the dungeon.

The hunter stretched out his hand to stop Qin Yu. He said in a low voice, “Qin Yu, you’d better be careful. If Zhong Wu finds out that Jing Bai had an affair with you, then Jing Bai’s crime will probably be confirmed.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Qin Yu glanced at him and sneered, “I came here this time to settle the score with Zhong Wu.”

After saying this, Qin Yu quickly walked towards the prison.

Near the prison.

There was a spell set up here. Rays of light lingered on the iron door, looking like a wonderful scene in the dark night.

Qin Yu reached out his hand and tried to open the prison, but he found that the moment he touched it, a terrifying power was approaching his palm.

Qin Yu, who was caught off guard, was immediately pushed back a few steps. He looked down and saw a red mark appearing on his palm as if he had been burned.

Qin Yu looked at the dungeon’s door coldly and said in a low voice, “I’m afraid this spell was not set up by Zhong Wu.”

With Zhong Wu’s ability, he did not have the ability to set up this spell.

Golden Light slowly appeared on Qin Yu’s body.

He once again arrived at the entrance of the dungeon. Under the cover of the Golden Light, he raised his hand and grabbed at the dungeon’s door.

That enormous force surged out once again. Not only did Qin Yu receive a huge backlash, his palm felt as if it had been thrown into a sea of fire. He was in unbearable pain!

......

“This feeling...”Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly. Both of his hands were actually burned by the dungeon’s door!

One had to know that Qin Yu, who had stepped into the mighty realm, had a body that was beyond imagination!

Even an existence like the first elder would find it difficult to hurt Qin Yu.

However, the iron door in front of him had easily burned Qin Yu’s skin!

“As expected of the hunter organization...”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

He endured the intense pain and the internal Qi on his body grew stronger and stronger.

Meanwhile, Jing Bai, who was locked up in the dungeon, seemed to have sensed the movement from above.

He said coldly, “Who’s outside!”

Qin Yu hurriedly replied, “Big Brother Jing Bai, I’m Qin Yu.”

Jing Bai was obviously stunned. He hurriedly said, “Qin Yu? Why Are You Back?”

Qin Yu said, “I’m here to avenge my team leader this time.”

Jing Bai said in a deep voice, “Qin Yu, listen to my advice. Forget it. Zhong Wu’s white bone club is very powerful. You’re not his match.”

“Don’t worry. I have a way to deal with it,”said Qin Yu.

The white bone club was just an unresurrected holy weapon. To put it bluntly, there was not even a trace of holy power in it, so it was not worth being afraid of.

If it was a resurrected holy weapon, even if it was not fully resurrected, Qin Yu would not dare to provoke it.

In Qin Yu’s opinion, the white bone staff might not be stronger than the iron staff in his hand.

“Qin Yu, you...”

“Now is not the time to talk about this. Brother Jing Bai, do you know how to open this dungeon?”Qin Yu endured the intense pain from his palm and asked.

Jing Bai sighed slightly and said, “This dungeon is used to lock up the ferocious demonic beast. Other than the leader of the hunter organization, no one can open it. Qin Yu, give up.”

Qin Yu’s brows became tighter and tighter. He was surprised to find that with brute force, it was impossible to open the dungeon.

Not only that, the more Qin Yu used force, the tighter the iron door became.

“Damn it!”

Qin Yu could not help but curse inwardly. He released his hands and took a step back.

Immediately after, Qin Yu’s body emitted a golden light, and his internal Qi surged out like a tidal wave.

That golden light was like the sun rising in the dark night, turning the pitch-black surroundings into daytime.

A huge wave of air surged out from Qin Yu’s body and swept out in all directions.

“Hu...”

The green rock forest seemed to have stirred up a hurricane. Under the strong wind, leaves rustled down. The trees that were as thick as three people hugging each other were uprooted!

Such a commotion naturally attracted the hunters in the organization.

“What happened?”Someone was startled awake from his sleep and his expression changed greatly.

“Could it be that a demonic beast has stepped into the hunter organization?”

“Quick, go and take a look!”

A group of people rushed towards the prison.

Qin Yu, who was standing at the entrance of the prison, had already unleashed his internal Qi to the maximum.

“Since I can’t open it, then I’ll destroy this door,”Qin Yu said coldly.

As he spoke, Qin Yu’s fist was already wrapped in pure gold. At a glance, the end of his right arm looked like a sun had appeared!

This spell was the ten thousand spell breaking punch!

Qin Yu planned to use brute force to forcefully break open this dungeon!

Right at this moment, the hunters rushed to the scene. When they saw Qin Yu’s figure, they were immediately shocked!

“Qin Yu? You... Why are you here?”Someone asked in shock.

“Could it be that he came back to save Jing Bai?”

“As expected, paper can not cover fire. Qin Yu will naturally rush back when he gets the news.”

Qin Yu ignored everyone’s words. He clenched his Golden Fist and headed straight for the Iron Gate of the dungeon.

“Boom!”

The Golden Fist smashed into the Iron Gate of the dungeon! At the moment of collision, a water-like airwave swept out in all directions!

The surrounding hunters were instantly sent flying in unison. Those who had the strength and status were even directly cut in half!

Large swaths of trees were swept clean. The originally lush hunter organization seemed to have been pushed flat in an instant.

Such a dense force caused the surrounding crowd to shoot out explosively, afraid that they would be implicated and end up as innocent ghosts.

But even so, the Iron Gate of the dungeon was actually undamaged!

On the surface of the iron gate, rays of extremely sacred light appeared.

This light enveloped the iron gate, as if it could block all kinds of power.

“Qin Yu, don’t waste your energy.”From below, Jing Bai’s voice came.

“That’s right, this iron gate can not be broken by brute force.”Guan Zhuang’s voice followed.

Qin Yu’s expression was gloomy and he didn’t say anything.

He looked at the Iron Gate coldly, no one knew what he was thinking.

“Mr. Qin.”

At this moment, an old man walked out from the crowd.

He walked quickly to Qin Yu and cupped his hands.

Qin Yu looked at him and asked in a deep voice, “Who are you?”

The old man smiled and said, “I’m just an ordinary hunter from the hunter organization. I’ve been here for more than 300 years.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu hurriedly cupped his hands and said, “Old Sir, do you know how to break this Iron Gate?”

The old man shook his head slightly, he said, “This iron gate was set up by the third generation team leader with a formation in order to lock down the extremely vicious demonic beast. If it can be broken by brute force, then the meaning of this formation will be completely lost.”

Qin Yu’s brows were tightly knitted as he waited for his next words.

The old man continued, “This formation was taught by the third generation team leader. Only the team leader of the Hunter organization can break the formation.”

“So... I can only go to Zhong Wu?”Qin Yu raised his eyebrows slightly.
