Chapter 637: The Method to Activate the Male Corpses! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Hearing Qin Yu’s voice, the man with the mustache was so frightened that he jumped up.

He stared at him and said, “Why are you like a ghost? You don’t even make a sound!”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “It’s because you were too engrossed in looking at it. I really don’t understand. Is this coffin that scary?”

The man with the mustache waved his hand impatiently and said, “She... forget it. You won’t understand even if I tell you. Where are the things?”

Qin Yu didn’t waste any more time. He immediately activated his Spatial Magic Artifact and released all the items he had snatched from the auction.

Thirty treasures were neatly placed there.

The worldly antiques and cultural relics were thrown to the side by the man with the mustache.

His eyes quickly locked onto the sword and he grabbed it in his hand excitedly.

“This is it!” The man with the mustache said excitedly.

He held the sword excitedly and his eyes shone with a strange light.

Qin Yu muttered, “This sword looks ordinary, and it doesn’t seem like a treasure. Why are you so excited?”

The man with the mustache stroked the sword and said excitedly, “Indeed, this sword isn’thing. Otherwise, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association wouldn’t have sold it.”

At this point, the man with the mustache paused.

He put away the sword and then said with a nonchalant smile, “But if this sword is in my hands, then it’s different.”

“What do you mean?” Qin Yu asked, puzzled.

The man with the mustache stroked his chin and thought for a moment, then waved his hand and said, “Forget it. Let me tell you.”

“There are four swords in total. They are called the Four Swords of Immortality. They are the weapons of an important figure.”

“As for who that important figure is, you won’t know even if I tell you. In any case, he is an extremely powerful figure from many years ago.”

Hearing the words of the man with the mustache, Qin Yu became more and more curious about him.

This man with the mustache seemed to know everything, and he also knew a lot of things from many years ago.

“Important figure:” Qin Yu Thought for a moment.

Then, he looked at the man with the mustache and said, “Between this master of the Four Swords of Immortality and that masked woman, who is more powerful?”

When the masked woman was mentioned, the man with the mustache’s expression became a little ugly.

He said impatiently, “Then how would I know? I have to let the two of them fight.”

Qin Yu didn’t ask anymore. Instead, he said seriously, “I have already given you the thing. You should tell me how to activate the two male corpses.”

The man with the mustache said with a smile, “Of course I can tell you, but only I can activate the method to activate the male corpses!”

Qin Yu was stunned and said unhappily, “What do you mean? Do you want to backtrack?”

“No, no, no, I have no intention of backtracking!” The man with the mustache hurriedly waved his hand.

“What I said is true. Only I can activate this spell.”

“As long as you bring the mask over, I have a way to make these two male corpses move!”

At this point, the man with the mustache chuckled and said, “Look, it’s not that I don’t want to help you, but the mask isn’t here.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and couldn’t make up his mind for a moment.

Although Qin Yu had been in a deep relationship with the man with the mustache during this period of time, in reality, Qin Yu didn’t know anything about the background of the man with the mustache.

No one knew if he could be trusted.

If he was an evil person, he would definitely be a danger to Xiao Yu.

“I can get the mask,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The man with the mustache waved his hand and said, “Alright, stop bragging. I’ve been looking for that mask for many years, but I still can’t find it.”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “I can really find the mask, but I’m sorry, I can’t give it to you.”

When the man with the mustache saw Qin Yu’s serious expression, his expression also changed slightly.

“Are you telling the truth?” The man with the mustache no longer had the slightest bit of amusement.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, but I said, I can’t give it to you.”

The man with the mustache frowned and said, “That mask is a holy object. If you really know where it is, even if it’s just a meeting, I’ll be satisfied.”

“Really?” Qin Yu asked.

“Really.” The man with the mustache nodded.

Although that was the case, Qin Yu was still a little worried.

After thinking for a while, Qin Yu looked at the man with the mustache and said, “Give me one night to think about it.”

The man with the mustache touched his chin and said, “You still don’t believe me? I saved your life.”

“This thing isn’t mine, so I have to consider it seriously,” Qin Yu said.

“I’ll give you the news tomorrow morning.”

The man with the mustache could only spread his hands and say, “Alright then, I won’t make things difficult for you.”

Qin Yu grunted and said no more.

He put away the treasures on the ground, turned around, and walked into the inner room.

At this time, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association was in an uproar.

This matter had a great impact on the Jingdu Martial Arts Association! It was like slapping them in front of everyone!

“The most important thing now is to catch that black-robed man as soon as possible!” In the meeting, Qu Xie gritted his teeth and said.

“Well, as long as we catch the black-robed man, we can at least give an explanation.” The assistant nodded slightly.

“I’m afraid it won’t be long before the higher-ups come to hold us accountable.” Qu Xie sighed with a trace of worry on his face.

Speaking of the devil, at this moment, a man wearing a traditional tunic walked in.

Upon seeing this person, everyone from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association stood up in unison.

“Grand Secretary, you... Why are you here...” Qu Xie said with an unsightly expression.

The Grand Secretary said coldly, “How does the Jingdu Martial Arts Association do things? Can’t you even handle security properly?”

Qu Xie hurriedly explained, “This... This is just a misunderstanding...”

“Misunderstanding?” The Grand Secretary slapped the table.

“There are so many casualties this time, and you’re telling me it’s a misunderstanding?”

“Isn’t the Jingdu Martial Arts Association known as the official of the martial arts world? Is this your result?”

Qu Xie opened his mouth to explain, but the Grand Secretary didn’t give him a chance at all.

“Many ordinary people were implicated in this matter. You’d better give me a reasonable explanation,” the Grand Secretary said coldly.

“Otherwise, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association should consider your future carefully.”

After saying this, the Grand Secretary turned around and left.

Although it was just a few words, it made Qu Xie and the others break out in cold sweat.

“It’s all that black-robed man’s fault...” Qu Xie’s body burst out with a murderous aura that quickly swept across the entire scene.

Xia Hang hurriedly said, “President Qu, quickly follow my plan and get rid of this black-robed man.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Qu Xie glanced at Xia Hang and said, “Okay, you will be in charge of this matter. I will give you the authority to use the black-gold robbed men.”

“Huh? Me?” Xia Hang’s expression suddenly became a little ugly.

If he stepped out, wouldn’t Qin Yu know that he was the one behind this?

“Why? Is there a problem?” Qu Xie asked with a cold expression.

Xia Hang gritted his teeth and his mind raced.

“No problem!” Xia Hang braced himself and accepted it!

“As long as Qin Yu is dead, even if he knows, what can he do?!” Xia Hang thought.
