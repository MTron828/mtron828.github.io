Chapter 1075: Chapter 1075, Qin Yu’s attitude 

Looking at Bai Tianhe’s ashen face, Qin Yu felt that it was laughable.

When a whore still wanted to set up a memorial archway, he always thought it was quite beautiful, but Qin Yu just didn’t give him the chance.

Very soon, the meeting officially began.

Mr. Zhou cleared his throat and said, “This time, the main reason for inviting everyone is to rebuild the martial arts association in Jingdu.”

Qin Yu had guessed it long ago, so he didn’t look too surprised.

“I wonder if everyone has any opinions and suggestions?”Mr. Zhou asked.

“I think the martial arts association of Jingdu should be discussed by everyone. We can’t let one person take over,”someone said.

Mr. Zhou nodded slightly, seeming to agree with this proposal.

The people from the other secret realms also echoed, “That’s right. Only when everyone controls it together can we prevent it from being monopolized like before.”

Hearing their words, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

Although this laughter wasn’t loud, it was clearly visible.

Yan Jinyao said somewhat deliberately, “Qin Yu, what do you mean by this sneer? What, you don’t agree? Don’t tell me you want to monopolize the second secret realm and the Martial Arts Association of Jingdu?”

Qin Yu coldly swept his gaze over everyone and said, “When you attacked the second secret realm, each and every one of you were as silent as dead people. When the results were divided, did you F * cking jump out?”

“You even controlled it together. How can you have the face to say such a thing?”

The many realm masters present were instantly speechless, unable to say a single word.

“Qin Yu, then what do you mean?”Mr. Zhou asked.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “I don’t really care. I’ll listen to Mr. Zhou’s decision.”

Speaking up to this point, Qin Yu paused for a moment before continuing, “Of course, I believe that Mr. Zhou will be fair and just.”

The meaning of his words was very obvious. He was telling Mr. Zhou that if it wasn’t fair, then Qin Yu would definitely not be satisfied.

Mr. Zhou naturally could hear the tone in Qin Yu’s words. He smiled and said, “Today, everyone is here to discuss. If you have anything to say, just say it.”

“Really?”Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

“Of course.”Mr. Zhou nodded slightly.

Qin Yu slowly stood up and said, “Okay, then I’ll say what I have to say.”

He swept his gaze over everyone present and coldly said, “If you ask me, these people don’t even have the right to participate in the discussion. They still want to jointly control the Jingdu Martial Arts Association? Control a few of them!”

When these words came out, everyone was shocked.

“It seems that you really want to occupy the Jingdu martial arts association. No wonder you worked so hard. To put it bluntly, don’t you still want to replace them?”Yan Jinyao said in a strange tone.

Qin Yu sneered, “I can hand over the Jingdu martial arts association, but I won’t give it to you.”

Although everyone was somewhat displeased, Qin Yu’s current strength was unparalleled, and no one was willing to provoke him.

Mr. Zhou also didn’t seem to think that Qin Yu’s attitude would be so tough, after thinking for a moment, he said, “There must be someone to manage the martial arts world. How about this, we all establish a high-level management together and jointly manage it. We will recommend Qin Yu as the President of the Association, How About It?”

“I agree!”Bai Tianhe seemed to want to please Qin Yu. He was the first to raise his hand.

“I agree too!”Someone also stood up and said.

It was better to let Qin Yu be the president than not to let them participate directly.

Therefore, many people raised their hands and agreed with Mr. Zhou’s proposal.

“Qin Yu, what do you think?”Mr. Zhou looked at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I’m not interested in this president. Mr. Zhou, you’d better choose someone else.”

“Not interested?”Mr. Zhou frowned slightly.

“Qin Yu, the position of President has a lot of power. You’d better think about it,”Mr. Zhou reminded him.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I’m really not interested. I don’t care about the so-called power at all.”

These realm masters were still fighting to get the JINGDU martial arts association and the power that belonged to him.

Unexpectedly, Qin Yu’s ambition was no longer here. He yearned for a wider world. This so-called power was not worth mentioning at all.

“Mr. Zhou, it’s better for your people to be the president. As for you wanting to balance the various forces, I have no objections,”Qin Yu stood up and said.

“You can rest assured. I Won’t rely on force to occupy the Jingdu martial arts association, and I won’t become the next gu family.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“If there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave first. Just let me know when you’ve discussed it.”

After saying this, Qin Yu stood up and left.

When he reached the door, Qin Yu turned around and pointed at Yan Jinyao.

“Three days later, right? Pick a place and I’ll wait for you,”Qin Yu said coldly.

With that, Qin Yu left gracefully.

In the meeting room, everyone looked at each other. Even Mr. Zhou felt a headache coming on.

When they decided to use Qin Yu to reduce the power of the martial arts association in Jingdu, someone had raised this question.

With Qin Yu’s personality, he would definitely not listen to their orders.

The meeting ended on bad terms. Mr. Zhou stood up and said, “Important matters usually need to be discussed in many meetings. There is a lot of time. Everyone, take your time. Let’s call it a day.”

After saying that, Mr. Zhou also left the venue.

Only the masters of the various states were left in the meeting room. Just as they were about to leave, Yan Jinyao extended his finger and sealed the door.

“Everyone, don’t be in a hurry to leave,”Yan Jinyao said indifferently.

He stood up and walked to Mr. Zhou’s seat and sat down, then, he knocked on the table and said, “Everyone has seen Qin Yu’s attitude. I think everyone is clear that no matter who is the president, no one can avoid Qin Yu.”

“His arrogance has already exceeded our imaginations. Sooner or later, he will ride on everyone’s necks.”

“Young Master Yan, what do you mean?”Someone asked.

Yan jinyao sneered, “In my opinion, we have to work together to get rid of him to prevent future trouble!”
