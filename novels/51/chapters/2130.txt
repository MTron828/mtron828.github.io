2131 Soul Chasing Chain

“Oh?” Hearing Qin Yu’s words, the three linen-robed elderly men appeared somewhat shocked.

They looked at each other and seemed not to expect Qin Yu to agree so readily.

“However, the Traceless Immortal Scripture is not with me for the time being. After the day of the Path of Heaven ends, I will definitely give it to you,” Qin Yu continued.

After hearing this, the expressions of the three people instantly turned cold.

“I’ve long heard that Qin Yu is crafty and cunning. Now I’ve seen it today. You really live up to your reputation,” a linen-robed elderly man said coldly.

“If you don’t hand over the Traceless Immortal Scripture today, not only will you not have the chance to participate in the day of the Path of Heaven, but you will also die here!” another person shouted.

Qin Yu looked at the warship that was going further away, anxiety could not help but rise in his heart.

In the next moment, a golden light suddenly erupted from Qin Yu’s body. His speed soared, and he almost shrunk the ground into an inch. In the blink of an eye, he shot out!

“You want to leave? Dream on!” the linen-robed elders shouted and immediately chased after him.

Qin Yu’s speed was not exactly unrivaled in the world, but it was close. Even the linen-robed elderly men seemed a bit overwhelmed.

They followed behind Qin Yu but always fell behind a distance, unable to get close.

“How can this kid be so fast!” An elderly man could not help but feel shocked!

They were all top-notch figures who had stepped into the True Saint Realm but could not catch up to a Semi-Saint now. How could they not be shocked?

“We can’t let this kid escape,” a linen-robed elderly man said coldly.

The other three nodded slightly and immediately began to activate the technique.

Although Qin Yu’s speed was tremendously fast, True Saint possessed supernatural abilities.

Upon hearing the elderly man’s words, the other two immediately stopped in their tracks. They crossed their hands simultaneously and began to recite an incantation.

The internal qi of the three became connected, and a powerful force formed among them. This force grew stronger and eventually became as heavy as mountains and seas.

“Soul Chasing Chain!”

An elderly man shouted in a low voice. A chain that was shining with a dark blue light appeared in his hand. His body leaned forward, and he threw the chain toward Qin Yu.

It was a great supernatural ability the three jointly executed, the Soul Chasing Chain. This chain possessed incredible speed and flexibility. Its characteristic was that no matter how the targets fled, it could track them. Once it locked onto them, it was almost impossible to escape.

Most importantly, this Soul Chasing Chain also had a strong binding power. Once entangled, it was like being bound by countless chains, unable to move.

Looking at this Soul Chasing Chain dancing in the air, Qin Yu could not help but feel a hint of nervousness in his heart. He knew that it was crucial to his escape. Once he was entangled by the Soul Chasing Chain, he would lose the possibility of escaping.

His speed was even faster, and the golden light was even brighter. He was like a meteor as he madly rushed in the direction of the day of the Path of Heaven.

And the Soul Chasing Chain was like a thorn in his side, following closely behind him, constantly threatening him.

At this moment, countless people looked up at the sky. They saw the golden meteor and the dancing blue chain.

“That’s… Qin Yu!”

“He’s being chased by the Ni Clan!”

The whispers in the crowd grew louder. They looked in shock at the golden meteor in the sky and the blue chain chasing crazily. That brazen and fearless escape and pursuit made people’s hearts beat faster.

At this moment, the Soul Chasing Chain seemed to be even more anxious. The light on the chain was like a lamp, bright and dazzling. Meanwhile, Qin Yu’s figure also became increasingly faster. It was almost impossible to capture it with the naked eye.

The linen-robed elderly man looked at the golden meteor gradually disappearing into the distance with a cold expression.

“Let me see where you can escape!”

At this moment, the Soul Chasing Chain suddenly flashed with a bright blue light. That light was like a dragon’s roar, and a terrifying internal qi erupted from the chain as if it could tear the world apart.

“Lock!”

The linen-robed elderly man suddenly shouted. His finger drew a strange trajectory in the air as if he was setting up some seal.

In an instant, the flying Soul Chasing Chain seemed to have received an order and accelerated madly. At the same time, the blue light on the chain became even more intense.

Suddenly, a golden light flashed, and Qin Yu’s figure was revealed. He seemed to sense the danger behind him, and his expression slightly changed.

But at this moment, that Sou-chasing Chain had already rapidly approached. Like a spirit snake, it instantly coiled around Qin Yu’s body.

Qin Yu’s expression slightly changed. He felt a powerful binding force forming around his body. That Soul Chasing Chain was like a heavy shackle, tightly binding him.

Looking at the bound Qin Yu, the faces of those linen-robed elderly men finally revealed a trace of a satisfied smile.

The three soon arrived in front of Qin Yu. Seeing Qin Yu being tied up, a cold smile appeared on their faces.

“Hand over Traceless Immortal Scripture, and I’ll spare your life!” a linen-robed elderly man shouted.

Qin Yu’s eyes flickered with determination. He took a deep breath, and then the aura of his entire body suddenly increased. A powerful force emanated from within him.

“You want the Traceless Immortal Scripture? Let’s see if you have the ability! “Qin Yu’s voice was cold and firm. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He clasped his palms together with fingertips pointed forward. In his palm, a chaotic air current appeared. Golden light flowed within it, emitting a powerful pressure.

It was his secret technique, Chaos-origin Sword Technique!

The Chaos-origin Sword Technique in his hand soon took shape. An enormous golden Spiritual Energy Sword shot out from his palm, bringing a powerful aura as it rushed straight toward the Soul Chasing Chain.

“Chaos-origin Sword!” Qin Yu shouted lightly, and the golden Spiritual Energy Sword exploded, shooting into the sky like a bolt of lightning.

Everything happened in the blink of an eye. The golden Spiritual Energy Sword was like a wild horse that had escaped from its reins, madly rushing toward the Soul Chasing Chain.

The blue light on the Soul Chasing Chain suddenly expanded, but it seemed incomparably small in front of the chaos-origin Spiritual Energy Sword.

The Spiritual Energy Sword and the Soul Chasing Chain collided fiercely. In an instant, a dazzling light erupted.

The violent impact caused Qin Yu’s figure to retreat slightly, but his eye expression became even more determined.

The binding power on the Soul Chasing Chain began to tremble violently as if it was trying its best to resist the corrosion of the chaos-origin Spiritual Energy Sword.

However, the power of the chaos-origin Spiritual Energy Sword was incomparably powerful. Under the impact of the Spiritual Energy Sword, the binding force began to crack.

When the linen-robed elderly men saw this, their expressions instantly changed. “Stop him!” an elderly man shouted. The three immediately joined forces to activate the Soul Chasing Chain in an attempt to mend that crack.

However, the power of Qin Yu’s Chaos-origin Sword Technique had far exceeded their imagination!
