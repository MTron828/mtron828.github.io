Chapter 2810: Swastika’s Power of Heavenly Sin

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Chang Mang’s face was deathly pale. He did not even have the chance to resist the baptism of his divine soul just now.

The memories of the reincarnation of hundreds of people made him lose consciousness for a moment.

If not for the Situ family’s Divine Sun Tree and Meng Jing, none of them would have been able to escape this attack.

Whoosh!

The internal qi of One Thought Reincarnation slowly subsided.

All of a sudden, a huge consciousness penetrated through space.

Qin Yu’s expression was greatly shocked. Even time seemed to have frozen. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Demonic Beasts were flying in the air. The spring water from the mountain peak and the breeze seemed to have slowed down.

The entire area was divided into thousands of different spaces.

The flow of time in these spaces was different. It seemed to change according to the attention of the divine sense.

Time had stopped in the area where Qin Yu and the others were.

Although they couldn’t see it, they could feel the sea of divine sense surging between heaven and earth.

Even a thought was enough to kill them instantly.

“Boom!”

In an instant, Qin Yu’s entire body exploded.

His entire body instantly turned into snow dancing in the sky. Countless sticky tentacles passed through and pulled the minced meat that filled the sky back.

“Oh no!”

The Investiture of Gods must have sensed something. Could it be that his One Thought Reincarnation had triggered something?

Qin Yu’s mind was in chaos. That enormous consciousness had yet to disappear.

Instead, it turned to the others.

Qin Yu’s face suddenly turned pale.

Whether it was Fatty Situ, Chang Mang, or the holy daughter, none of them had the chance to resist.

He clenched his fists tightly. Reincarnation paths slowly appeared behind him. Even if the fireflies attacked, he would try to block them!

“Don’t attack!”

Qin Yu heard a familiar voice.

He hesitated for a moment, but he chose to believe the voice.

If he were to attack now, it would prove that the Investiture of Gods did not control him.

At that time, he would probably suffer a true calamity. Everyone here would not be able to escape.

The power descended again.

There seemed to be some difference between it and Saint Power.

Qin Yu could not resist the impact of this power.

If it had not been for the fact that he had already become a god, this attack would have directly taken its life.

Three huge swastikas appeared in front of the three of them, temporarily blocking this fatal attack.

Suddenly, countless swastikas appeared in the sky.

The power of Heavenly Sin!

Fatty Situ exclaimed.

He was very familiar with this power. It was also the first time he met Qin Yu in the Heavenly Sin.

When the curse power appeared, nearly 80% of the Investiture of Gods’ power was offset.

When the remaining power hit the three of them, it was no longer enough to cause fatal damage.

The power of the Investiture of Gods swam in this area as if it were checking the power that had just been released.

After a while, the power finally disappeared.

Only then did the passage of time in the region return to normal.

What a terrifying power! Qin Yu felt this was not a power a single person could achieve.

This power gave Qin Yu the feeling that it was another sky.

That was a god high above. Qin Yu felt this was only a forbidden power in the Investiture of Gods.

It was also the power that was wandering outside and on guard. It was looking for any living beings that had broken through its control. If it happened, it would use the power of thunder to wipe them out.

“Are you guys alright?”

Qin Yu hurriedly looked at the three of them.

“I’m fine, Boss Qin Yu. What’s with that thing? I couldn’t even breathe just now.”

Chang Mang’s heart skipped a beat.

“Xiao Hai, how is Ruoxue now?”

Qin Yu shouted anxiously.

“She is a sinner of Tianzui. She signed a contract with Heavenly Sin to let you go. Before she atones for her sins, she will not die.” Xiao Hai’s figure appeared in front of everyone like a spirit.

“Atonement! Before!”

Qin Yu’s body trembled. He understood what the words meant.

The days before her atonement must be more terrifying than death.

Qin Yu had already felt this kind of method in the Investiture of Gods. Qin Yu could no longer suppress his anger thinking about how Ruoxue might have been tortured in Heavenly Sin.

As if sensing his emotions, the Investiture of Gods emitted a strong fluctuation, wanting to summon his divine soul back to his true body.

“Boss Qin Yu, calm down! Calm down! Even if your divine soul completely returned, can you defeat Heavenly Sin? If you don’t have this confidence, the

Investiture of Gods will only discover your return, let alone save Yan Ruoxue!”

Fatty Situ had heard Chang Mang talk about Qin Yu and Heavenly Sin, so he quickly calmed him down, afraid that he would lose control. “Don’t worry, I know what to do. I only hate myself for being useless.”

“Xiao Hai, is Ruoxue here too?”

Qin Yu asked in a deep voice.

Xiao Hai said softly as he held Qin Yu’s shoulder.

“There are millions of living beings in this world. Even the gods can’t guarantee that they have no regrets. The most important thing is the outcome.”

Xiao Hails voice was as refined as ever. It seemed to have a calming magic.

Qin Yu smashed his fist onto the ground. He was unaware that his bones were broken.

“Xiao Hai, have you recovered the memories taken by the ghost realm?” After a long time, Qin Yu finally calmed himself down.

“The power of Heavenly Sin allowed me to take back part of it. It was something that Ksitigarbha took away after all, so it’s not that simple.

However, I have another idea this time.”

Xiao Hai stared at Qin Yu with a fanatical look in his eyes.

“What state are you in right now?”

Qin Yu asked with a frown. He could roughly guess what Xiao Hai was thinking. He probably wanted to enter the Investiture of God’s space just like how he had entered Heavenly Sin. However, these two things were different.

Qin Yu felt that Xiao Hai’s idea was not very feasible. In a sense, the Investiture of Gods was a living thing.

Although Heavenly Sin had its consciousness and was extremely powerful, it could not be considered a living thing.

This was the biggest difference between the two.

The only person who could come out now was the person who had the Investiture of Gods.

This also meant there was no solution to this Investiture of Gods. There was a high chance he would end up like Smoker Xie and the others.

“My lifespan had already been exhausted when I forcefully used the power of the Spacetime Hall. However, I assimilated the power of Heavenly Sin back then. My soul is residing in it now. Although I managed to survive, the power of Heavenly Sin is constantly washing over my divine soul now..”
