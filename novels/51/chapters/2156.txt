2157 Celestial Artifact

Immediately after, the Prince of Great Xia’s gaze landed on Qin Yu.

“Mr. Qin, long time no see,” the Prince of Great Xia said weakly.

“I didn’t expect us to meet here,” Qin Yu sighed slightly and said.

The prince’s face had a hint of bitterness. He seemed incredibly helpless about the current situation. He shook his head and said, “I’m afraid I’ll be trapped here forever.”

There was no doubt that with the current power of the Prince of Great Xia, he had no chance of making a comeback.

“I’m afraid my situation is even worse than yours,” Qin Yu sighed and said.

The prince was naturally clear about what had happened to Qin Yu. He patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “I believe you will be fine.”

“I hope so,” Qin Yu said.

After that, Qin Yu, accompanied by the Prince of Great Xia, walked into the depths of Peach Blossom Island. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

On their way, several women threw themselves at the prince, but the prince politely rejected them all.

Qin Yu said jokingly, “So many beautiful women are throwing themselves at you. Your Highness is indeed lucky.”

“Lucky?” The prince laughed bitterly. “If I leave behind any children, I’m afraid I won’t be able to keep my life.”

Qin Yu was quiet. Compared to the prince who lost his freedom, Qin Yu felt that his situation was not as painful.

Soon, led by the prince, they arrived at the place the negotiations would take place.

The place the negotiations would take place was an ancient-looking and simple pavilion. It was built against a mountain, with its back against the towering mountain range facing the sparkling lake, and was surrounded by layers of peach blossom forests.

The pavilion was not big, but it had a unique shape and exquisite design. The entire pavilion was made of red bronze, presenting a deep and ancient hue. The four corners stood tall, and the eaves slightly curved upwards. Every detail exuded a unique style and exceptional craftsmanship, leaving people feeling amazed.

In the center of the pavilion was an octagonal marble table. On the stone table, a chair made of mahogany was placed in every corner. It looked simple, but it was difficult to conceal its exquisiteness. These eight corners coincidentally corresponded to the current nine great aristocratic families. Although the number was somewhat unmatched, it made some sense.

It was surrounded by carefully trimmed peach blossoms. Whenever there was a breeze, peach petals would fall, filling the pavilion’s surroundings with a strong sense of spring.

Above the pavilion, a gigantic formation was floating. It was surrounded by strands of the mysterious power of the way. Whenever someone approached, the power of the way would buzz and reject them.

At this moment, the people from the various aristocratic families had already arrived, and naturally, the one leading them was Yan Tianshi.

Qin Yu glanced around and soon spotted Yan Ruoxue.

The moment he saw Yan Ruoxue, he could not help but smile.

Worry filled Yan Ruoxue’s eyes. She could not help but rush to Qin Yu but was stopped by two elders.

Qin Yu shook his head and indicated that she would be fine using his gaze. Then he followed Dean Lei and walked forward.

The aristocratic families looked at Qin Yu with cold gazes. What surprised Qin Yu was that Si Liuhe did not come, but Si Shiyue did.

It was evident that Flower Granny’s incident had significantly impacted Si Jiuhe, and he had even given up on such an important occasion.

Bringing Qin Yu along, Dean Lei swaggered over and sat down.

The moment he sat down, several cold lights headed straight for Qin Yu! That invisible pressure made Qin Yu’s body tremendously uncomfortable.

Dean Lei snorted coldly. With a wave of his sleeve, a gentle internal qi enveloped Qin Yu’s body, and the discomfort instantly disappeared.

“Let’s get down to business. Don’t play any useless tricks.” There was a hint of mockery in Dean Lei’s tone of voice.

Someone initiated to speak, “Dean Lei, you should know the outcome of today’s negotiations. Qin Yu must die. There is no second option.”

“Do you think I will agree?” Dean Lei said coldly.

At this moment, someone smiled faintly and said, “Dean Lei, do you think we can’t do anything to you just because you rely on Flower Granny?”

“I’m relying on Flower Granny?” Dean Lei sneered and said. “What? If you’re not convinced, let’s go out and fight now!”

“Am I afraid of you?”

The atmosphere instantly became tense, and they could make a move at any time.

These few people clearly came prepared. They were not afraid of Dean Lei at all and were eager to give it a try!

“If we were in Thunder Courtyard, we would naturally be helpless against you. But here, it’s not difficult for us to kill you!” someone said coldly.

“I don’t mind if you want to start a battle of celestial artifacts,” Dean Lei said coldly.

At the mention of celestial artifacts, everyone calmed down.

If he used a magical artifact of the Immortal Emperor, it might even destroy the entire Holy Region.

“Dean Lei, we must sort out this matter,” Yan Tianshi finally spoke.

Dean Lei looked at Yan Tianshi and said, “Let’s get straight to the point. As long as I can afford it, I’ll agree to it, taking it as compensation to you guys.”

Qin Yu could not help but grit his teeth.

Thunder Courtyard had many treasures, and everyone in the world was jealous. This time, the aristocratic families would probably take advantage of the opportunity to make hefty demands.

“Alright, then I won’t hold back,” Yan Tianshi stood up and said.

“First, let Qin Yu hand over the Traceless Immortal Scripture.

“Second, make Qin Yu cut off all contact with Yan Ruoxue.

“Third, I want the celestial artifact of your Immortal Emperor Lei and your immortal tomb of Thunder Courtyard.”

Hearing these three conditions, Dean Lei’s face turned ashen, and his body emitted a cold aura.

“Yan Tianshi, if we can negotiate, let’s negotiate. If we can’t, let’s fight,” Dean Lei suppressed his anger and said.

Yan Tianshi’s gaze landed on Dean Lei. At that moment, his expression turned incredibly cold!

“Dean Lei, today, you either hand over Qin Yu or agree to my conditions. There is no third option.” Yan Tianshi’s voice was incomparably cold, making people feel fear!

With that, terrifying lights instantly erupted in the sky, and strange talismans came from all directions!

They had actually set up a formation in advance! Under the circumstances where they had no choice, they even wanted to get rid of Dean Lei as well!

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. He hurriedly stood up and blocked in front of Dean Lei. “This matter has nothing to do with Dean Lei! If you want to settle the score, just come at me!”

“Qin Yu, sit down!” Dean Lei shouted.

Then, with a thought, a magic artifact appeared in Dean Lei’s hand.

It was a magic staff, and a faint blue light flickering on it.

The magic staff was very small, and Dean Lei could hold it in his palm. At a glance, there was almost no internal qi fluctuation, and no one could see anything different about it.

“This is… celestial artifact?” Someone recognized this item, and his expression immediately changed drastically!

“It’s the magical artifact that follows Immortal Emperor Lei. Dean Lei, you actually brought a celestial device here. What do you want?”
