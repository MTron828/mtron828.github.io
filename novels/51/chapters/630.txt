Chapter 631: The Method to Control the Corpses! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

At this moment, Yan Jinyao was extremely inflated. He was very interested in this legendary black-robed man.

“Young Master Yan, it’s best if you don’t underestimate the enemy. According to our speculation, this black-robed man might be Ancestor Guan,” Qu Xie said in a deep voice.

“Ancestor Guan?” Hearing this name, Yan Jinyao frowned slightly.

Ancestor Guan wasn’t famous, but to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, he was quite famous.

It was said that thirty years ago, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association sent several Martial Marquises to capture Ancestor Guan, but they all failed in the end.

Not only that, but Ancestor Guan also killed more than ten Martial Marquises of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!

“Back then, he could be considered an invincible existence. After so many years, God knows what level his strength has reached,” Qu Xie said.

Yan Jinyao’s expression also didn’t look too good.

If it was Ancestor Guan, then he might really have to be a little more careful.

“President Qu, I understand. Thank you for the reminder.” Yan Jinyao nodded slightly, then turned around and left.

In order to protect Yan Jinyao, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association didn’t spread the news that Yan Jinyao had activated his bloodline, so as not to attract the black-robed man’s attack.

On the other side, Qin Yu didn’t take any action for the time being. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He stayed in his private room all day while thinking about how to save Yan Ruoxue.

“Continuing to kill like this won’t solve the fundamental problem,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

However, Qin Yu’s current strength wasn’t enough to save Yan Ruoxue.

So far, Qin Yu had seen the black-gold robe of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. There were also people with purple robes.

The black-gold-robed Yan Guiyi was enough to make Qin Yu’s hair stand on end, not to mention the even more powerful purple-robed people.

“What should I do...” Qin Yu clenched his fists in anguish.

As long as he thought of Yan Ruoxue’s suffering, Qin Yu couldn’t control his emotions.

“If I can use those two male corpses... saving her won’t be a problem,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He immediately released the two male corpses from the Spatial Magic Artifact.

The two corpses were placed right in front of Qin Yu.

Qin Yu tried to use his divine sense to awaken the two corpses, but unfortunately, he failed.

“Oh my God, put these two things away quickly!”

At this moment, the voice of the man with the mustache suddenly came from outside.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He glanced at the man with the mustache and said, “How did you know I was here?”

The man with the mustache said mysteriously, “I have my own ways. I can’t tell you.”

Looking at the man with the mustache in front of him, Qin Yu felt curious.

What was his origin? Even Qin Yu had never heard of the spells he controlled.

“By the way, do you have a way to make these two male corpses move?” Qin Yu pointed at the corpses on the ground and asked.

the man with the mustache immediately shivered.

“Are you crazy? Do you want to die? You forgot about the last time, right?” The man with the mustache had a look of lingering fear.

Qin Yu explained, “I mean... to use their bodies to attack the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

“You mean... you want to use your divine sense to control them?” The man with the mustache guessed.

Qin Yu nodded. “That’s right.”

“You’re simply dreaming.” The man with the mustache couldn’t help but sneer.

“Do you know the origins of these two corpses? You want to control them? Do you have the qualifications?”

Qin Yu spread his hands and said, “If you can’t do it, then forget it. I’m just saying so casually.”

“But... if we can find the mask of the masked woman, we might still have a chance.” At this time, the man with the mustache suddenly changed the topic.

Qin Yu’s eyes immediately lit up!

He hurriedly grabbed the man with the mustache’s shoulder and said anxiously, “Are you telling the truth?”

“Of course,” the man with the mustache said proudly.

“I’ve read a lot of information these few days and learned that these two corpses are the servants of the masked woman. If you can really find the mask, I might really have a way to make them move,” the man with the mustache said seriously.

Qin Yu grabbed the man with the mustache’s arm and said excitedly, “Quickly tell me how to operate it! What is that spell?”

The man with the mustache rolled his eyes and said, “What’s the use of telling you? You don’t have a mask.”

Qin Yu braced himself and muttered in a low voice, “Maybe... maybe we can find it.”

“We’ll talk about it when you find it.” The man with the mustache flicked away Qin Yu’s hand.

But Qin Yu didn’t give up. He grabbed the man with the mustache’s arm and said, “If you don’t tell me, I definitely won’t let go!”

The man with the mustache scratched his head. His eyes rolled and he said, “Do you really want to know?”

“Obviously!” Qin Yu glared at him.

A trace of craftiness flashed through the man with the mustache’s eyes. He said with a smile, “I can tell you, but there is a condition.”

“What condition? Tell me,” Qin Yu hurriedly said.

The man with the mustache smiled and said, “As far as I know, there is a sword to be auctioned at the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s auction. I am very interested in this sword.”

“It’s a pity that I don’t have enough money to bid for it. If you are willing to contribute generously, I can consider it.”

Qin Yu hurriedly nodded and said, “No problem, I don’t lack money!”

But as soon as he said it, Qin Yu regretted it.

He was now a “dead man”, so he didn’t dare to use the money in his bank card, or else he would definitely be exposed.

“What’s wrong? Is there a problem?” The man with the mustache asked.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “How much money do you need?”

The man with the mustache counted with his fingers and said, “At least one billion, right? Those bastards from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association are so greedy.”

“One billion...” Qin Yu whispered.

For the current him, one billion was simply an astronomical figure.

“Sigh, if you really have no other way, then forget it.” The man with the mustache waved his hand.

“Who says I have no other way?!” Qin Yu stopped the man with the mustache.

“What? You have money? Then just give it to me directly.” The man with the mustache stretched out his hand and said.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No money.”

“Then you’re just spouting nonsense!” The man with the mustache said.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “I don’t need money at all.”

As he spoke, Qin Yu’s eyes looked at the black robe that was thrown on the ground.

The man with the mustache seemed to have understood something.

His body tensed up and he exclaimed, “Don’t tell me... you want to rob?”

“That’s right,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“It would be a waste not to snatch something from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

“Moreover, the identity of this black-robed person makes it more convenient for me to do this.”

The man with the mustache frowned and said, “This is very risky. Not only can you expose your identity, but you might also even be killed on the spot!”

Qin Yu glanced at the man with the mustache and shook his head. “I have no other way.”

As long as he could obtain the technique to control the corpses, any method was worth trying!
