“Xiao Hai, I’m glad you’re back. I hope you won’t disappoint me the next time we meet.”

Xiao Sheng left after saying that.

“You’re still the same.”

Xiao Hai said with a bitter smile.

After his lifespan ended, he used the power of the Heavenly Sin curse mark that he had comprehended to become a part of Heavenly Sin’s power. Although it had only lasted for a moment, he had comprehended a lot.

“Qin Yu, I hope we can meet again.”

Xiao Hai glanced at Qin Yu, who was still unconscious. He revealed a smile.

This little fellow had already grown to a level he could not even imagine!

“Are you leaving just like that? Do you want to come with me to Situ family? If you have any cultivation needs, the Situ family can satisfy you to the greatest extent. Once you pass Dao Realm level 9, it won’t be just stacking holy energy.” Fatty Situ invited Xiao Hai.

It would be a huge surprise for the Situ family if a genius who could simulate the power of Heavenly Sin could become the family’s guest elder.

“No, thanks. I’m not used to staying in one place for too long. It’s rare for me to have the opportunity to come to this world. If I don’t take a thorough look, I’ll probably regret it.” Xiao Hai said with a smile.

“Let’s part ways here, everyone.”

Xiao Hai left after saying that.

Lord Alester picked up the unconscious Ojn Yu, turned around, and left.

“Hey, will there be any problems if we let the woman take Brother Qin Yu away? Will she take advantage of him? Anyway, it won’t be a loss since she is from the Alester family.”

Fatty Situ muttered to himself.

“Save your effort…”

Cang Yunzi shook his head. This fatty from the Situ family was an eyesore no matter how he looked at him.

“Goodbye. Live well. I will do the same, Qin Yu…”

A bright light appeared in front of Qin Yu’s eyes. He felt a splitting headache.

He stood up with a silent expression. The touch on his lips and the fragrance on his body still existed.

Qin Yu stared blankly at the deep bite mark on his chest. He remained silent for a long time before slowly pushing the door open and leaving.

“Hey, are you leaving just like that? Is there anything you want to ask?” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Lord Alester, who was sitting in the corner, suddenly spoke.

“You can’t answer what I want to know…”

Qin Yu said.

He left step by step. Even if he was filled with unwillingness, he had no choice.

His fists made cracking sounds and his nails dug deep into his palms. He already understood what Cang Yunzi meant by the greatest sinner when

Yan Ruoxue woke him up.

Perhaps only the strongest bloodline of the Heavenly Emperor could attract the descend of the Heavenly Sin’s true form.

Yan Ruoxue might be the strongest remaining Immortal Emperor’s bloodline in this world, so the target this time was her.

His fourth mark had brought him to Yan Ruoxue.

He didn’t know what price Yan Ruoxue had paid to meet Qin Yu for the last time.

It was just that Qin Yu did not know when he could catch up to that kind of power. power.

The killing of sinners by Heavenly Sin would not be easily offset. One had to pay a huge price to survive, such as being tortured.

Qin Yu’s heart was twitching violently. He didn’t expect his reunion with Yan Ruoxue to be like this.

“Hey, your attitude makes me very unhappy. It just so happens that I also have a stomach full of anger that I have nowhere to vent.”

A cold voice came from behind.

A golden-haired woman appeared in front of Qin Yu. She tossed a talisman.

Boom!

A cloud of smoke burst out from it.

A phantom of the word ‘Realm’ appeared in the smoke. In the next moment, a force sucked Qin Yu and Lord Alester into it.

This seemed to be something similar to the dueling world. Qin Yu felt that there seemed to be spatial rules that were different from the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom.

Boom!

Before Qin Yu could react, a knee smashed his ribs.

The crow flew up from the wound. A strong silver holy energy burst out of Qin Yu’s hand.

However, a finger directly tapped on the point on his arm before that power could gather.

The Milky Way’s holy energy about to reach Qin Yu’s palm instantly exploded on his arm.

In an instant, a deep wound appeared on his arm.

What a strong woman!

Qin Yu was greatly shocked.

The Cold Dew of Heaven and Earth disappeared, and the Primal Chaos Flame in his body emitted from his pores.

Qin Yu clenched his fists tightly.

The Primal Chaos Flame gathered on Lord Alester’s body.

The entire space suddenly turned into a sea of fire. It slowly melted.

If Qin Yu had not controlled his power, the entire space would have shattered in an instant.

“Not a bad control method, but it’s too slow.”

The afterimage in the flames slowly disappeared, revealing Lord Alester’s figure.

The flame returned to Qin Yu’s fingertips. His palm suddenly stabbed to the side.

Projection!

An invincible force grabbed Qin Yu’s wrist.

It pulled him out of space and smashed him into the ground.

In an instant, fine cracks appeared on the entire ground. Qin Yu felt that he had lost count of how many of his bones had been broken.

“It’s just a child’s trick. Is that all?” Lord Alester said indifferently.

“I wonder what the person chosen by Heavenly Sin sees in you.”

“Shut up!”

Qin Yu revealed a cold killing intent. He would never allow anyone to speak ill of Yan Ruoxue.

At this moment, all the holy energy burst out of his body, making him look like a silver sun.

“Didn’t I say it was too slow?”

Lord Alester said.

Before she could finish her sentence, a figure had already blasted a palm at her. Her pupils suddenly trembled. Qin Yu’s fist, which had gathered his strongest strength, slammed into her abdomen in an instant.

A huge force pierced through her back, causing the barrier to tremble.

However, she did not retreat at all.

In her sea of consciousness, a black figure attacked at the same time as Qin Yu.

The Hell Nightmare!

This was the reason why she was in a daze just now.

“This world is your eternal nightmare. This is your limit. No matter how you try, it’s useless.”

“Did you see that?”

Qin Yu’s fists rained down on Lord Alester’s body.

“No! Why should you decide?”

Lord Alester roared angrily.

She clenched her fists tightly. The two of them completely gave up on defending.

The terrifying fists continued to smash into the other party’s body for three days and three nights.

Later on, the holy energy in their bodies was completely exhausted. However, the two of them still fought each other crazily with their physical strength.

They were like monsters with endless power. If it wasn’t for the barrier couldn’t withstand their power, they probably would continue fighting.

Qin Yu felt that not a single bone in his body was intact.

After using Hell’s Nightmare for a long time, his Night Qi was quickly

exhausted..
