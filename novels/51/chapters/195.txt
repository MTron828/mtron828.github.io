Chapter 196: On the Eve of the Great Battle Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Yan Jiang didn’t dare to neglect Yan Ruoxue’s text message.

He hurriedly took out his phone and opened the text message.

The content of the text message was very short. There were only a few words: keep an eye on Qin Yu. If necessary, you can kill Jiang Gu, or even wipe out the Jiang family.

Yan Jiang’s expression turned cold, and he quickly replied, “Yes, miss.”

After replying, Yan Jiang couldn’t help but take two puffs of his cigarette.

“What kind of fortune did Qin Yu cultivate in his lifetime...” Yan Jiang shook his head.

...

On the other side, after Qin Yu issued his challenge, he rushed straight to the Eastern Cemetery.

This place was desolate and uninhabited, and the dark energy was dense. The moment he stepped in, he felt a little uncomfortable.

Qin Yu first walked around this area, then turned around and left this place before arriving at the market.

He swaggered around the market and attracted a lot of people’s attention.

“Isn’t that Qin Yu? He actually has the mood to stroll around the market?”

“Hurry up and stay away from him, lest you get caught in the crossfire.”

Qin Yu was unmoved by the discussions of the crowd.

Updates by

He bought a lot of strange things in big and small bags, then rushed back to the Eastern Cemetery.

In the next few days, Qin Yu didn’t leave the Eastern Cemetery. Instead, he stayed here all day, and no one knew what he was doing.

In the dark, Mr. Zhong was quietly observing Qin Yu.

“Humph, what does Qin Yu want to do?” Mr. Zhong couldn’t help but frown when he saw Qin Yu’s strange actions.

“Mr. Zhong, do you need me to go and test the waters?” The person beside him asked.

Mr. Zhong was silent for a moment before he said coldly, “I’ll go myself.”

Then, Mr. Zhong put his hands behind his back and strode into the Eastern Cemetery.

At this moment, Qin Yu was sitting in the Eastern Cemetery while doing breathing exercises.

Everything looked unusually calm.

It wasn’t until Mr. Zhong walked to his side that Qin Yu slowly opened his eyes.

Looking at Mr. Zhong’s gloomy face, Qin Yu said coldly, “You’re the loyal dog of the Jiang family, right?”

Mr. Zhong’s expression changed, and the people around him were even more eager to make a move!

“You’re quite carefree,” Mr. Zhong said with a sneer.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said indifferently, “If you have something to say, say it quickly. I don’t want to see the people of the Jiang family.”

Mr. Zhong berated, “I heard that you are an apothecary?”

“So what if I am?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said.

Mr. Zhong said indifferently, “In that case, I think you can cure the eldest young master.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

“You’re right. I do have a way to cure Jiang Haoran, but so what?” Qin Yu said coldly.

Mr. Zhong said with a nonchalant smile, “Before you die, there’s still room for maneuver.”

“How about this? You cure the eldest young master’s illness, then ruin your own cultivation base and kneel in front of the Jiang family’s door for three days and three nights to announce to the world that this matter is over. How about it?” Mr. Zhong said indifferently with his hands behind his back.

“This can at least save your life, right?” Mr. Zhong continued.

When he heard this, Qin Yu’s face flashed with ridicule.

“Who do you think you are?” Qin Yu raised his brows and asked.

“A dog dares to appear in front of me and speak so cockily?!” Qin Yu coldly berated.

Mr. Zhong’s expression slightly changed. He narrowed his eyes and said, “I gave you a chance. Since you didn’t appreciate it, then wait for death!”

After saying this, Mr. Zhong turned around and left.

“Stop.”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly shouted.

Mr. Zhong sneered and said, “Why? Have you thought it through?”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. Instead, he instantly appeared in front of Mr. Zhong.

“I want to give you a reality check” Qin Yu said indifferently.

As soon as he said this, Qin Yu suddenly attacked! He suddenly smashed Mr. Zhong’s lower abdomen! Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

It seemed to be an ordinary punch, but it shattered Mr. Zhong’s dantian!

“You have to pay the price for showing off,” Qin Yu said with a sneer.

Mr. Zhong held his lower abdomen while feeling the rapid loss of inner strength in his body.

His expression instantly became extremely ugly!

“You... you actually ruined my cultivation base!” Mr. Zhong shouted in horror.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “I spared your life. You should thank me.”

He gave him a taste of his own medicine.

Mr. Zhong never thought that what he said would actually come true for him!

“Qin Yu, your crime can’t be forgiven! The patriarch definitely won’t let you off!” Mr. Zhong roared again and again.

Qin Yu ignored him. He turned his head back and continued to meditate.

In the Jiang family’s home, Jiang Gu’s expression was livid and he was furious!

“Qin Yu doesn’t take the Jiang family seriously at all!” Jiang Gu roared!

He never thought Qin Yu would be so arrogant!

Mr. Zhong said in pain, “Master, my cultivation base is crippled. You must avenge me...”

Jiang Gu glanced at Mr. Zhong and said coldly, “Don’t worry. I will skin him, pull out his tendons, and cut him into pieces!”

...

Time flew by.

In the blink of an eye, there was only one night left before the fight between the two.

That night, Qin Yu slowly opened his eyes.

“At level three of the Foundation Establishment Stage, my chances of winning against an Inner Strength Grandmaster are almost zero,” Qin Yu murmured.

He flipped his palm and took out the bronze sword and the stone statue.

“I wonder if this bronze sword can give me a surprise,” Qin Yu held the bronze sword in his right hand and murmured.

– The next morning -.

The Eastern Cemetery was packed with people.

Many warriors, afraid to miss this good show, came because of the buzz.

They didn’t dare to go forward, but surrounded the cemetery.

Hong Wu also came to the cemetery. He looked at Qin Yu, who was sitting cross-legged, with mixed feelings.

“Look, Qin Yu is already here.”

“What is he doing sitting there? Why does it look like he is meditating?”

“Don’t you guys think it’s a little strange? Ever since I stepped into the Eastern Cemetery, my body has been feeling a sense of oppression.”

“Yeah, the dark energy in the Eastern Cemetery is too heavy. It goes against our inner strength, so naturally, our strength will be suppressed.”

“Could it be that Qin Yu did this on purpose? But he will also be suppressed.”

For a moment, the surrounding people discussed animatedly.

Yan Jiang and another Inner Strength Grandmaster who was responsible for Qin Yu’s safety also came to the scene.

This Inner Strength Grandmaster was called Gao Rui. Although he wasn’t as strong as Yan Jiang, he was still a top Inner Strength Grandmaster.

He was far more powerful than Jiang Gu, who had just become an Inner Strength Grandmaster.

The two of them restrained their internal qi and observed in the dark.

“Mr. Yan, my internal qi also seems to feel a suppression,” Gao Rui said in a sullen voice.

Yan Jiang nodded slightly and said, “Regardless of the strength, there will be a certain level of suppression. However, the higher the strength, the smaller the suppression.”

Hearing this, Gao Rui couldn’t help but exclaim, “Isn’t Qin Yu digging his own grave?”

Yan Jiang also couldn’t figure it out.

After all, Jiang Gu was an Inner Strength Grandmaster, so the suppression he suffered was definitely much smaller than Qin Yu’s.

Just when the two were puzzled, a Rolls-royce drove over in a very high-profile manner.

As soon as the car stopped, they saw Jiang Gu get out of the car.
