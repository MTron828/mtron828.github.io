Chapter 1025: Chapter 1,025, headed to the Wan family’s secret realm

The entire martial arts world was silent.

This seemed to be the calm before the storm, and it appeared exceptionally dull.

On this morning, Qin Yu drove to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

Ever since the myriad ancient jade had caused this disturbance, the Divine Alchemist Pavilion had also begun to show signs of decline.

Although the pavilion master’s alchemy skills were incomparably powerful, she had yet to become a martial saint, so she was unable to compete with others in this era.

Qin Yu tidied up his clothes and Strode towards the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

“Elder Qin!”

Along the way, some disciples noticed Qin Yu and ran up to greet him.

These people treated Qin Yu as if he was their family, and their attitude was extremely warm.

“Elder Qin, I heard that you’ve entered the Martial Saint Realm and even killed Qiao Zun with three palm strikes. Is that true?”

“Not long ago, you said that you wanted to declare war on the second mystic realm. Are you really going to fight?”

“Elder Qin...”

Everyone surrounded Qin Yu’s side, chattering non-stop.

Qin Yu smiled and greeted them one by one. However, there were too many people and he really could not get away.

“Alright, Elder Qin must have something to do this time when he came back. Hurry up and make way.”At this moment, the fifth elder walked out and said.

Hearing the fifth Elder’s words, the many pharmacist reluctantly retreated to the side.

“Thank you, Fifth Elder.”Qin Yu bowed and said.

A trace of fear flashed across the fifth Elder’s face. He said with some bitterness, “With your current status, there’s no need for you to bow to me.”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Fifth elder, not to mention that I’m only a martial saint now, even if I step into the almighty or even the Tribulation Realm in the future, I’m still a junior.”

Fifth Elder opened his mouth as if he was moved.

“You’re here to look for the pavilion master, Right?”Fifth Elder changed the topic.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “Is she here?”

“She’s upstairs,”said fifth elder.

The two of them chatted as they walked. On the way, fifth elder sighed and said, “That Wan Gu Qiong is getting more and more outrageous. From the initial foul language to the later touching, she even wanted to commit adultery against the pavilion master a few days ago.”

“Unfortunately, we are weak. We Dare to be angry, but we don’t dare to speak.”

“Don’t worry, the Wan Gu Qiong won’t come again in the future,”Qin Yu said.

“Really?”There was a hint of pleading in the fifth Elder’s eyes.

Qin Yu nodded vigorously and said, “Yes, I came here this time to ask the pavilion master to accompany me to the Wan clan’s Secret Realm.”

“You want to...”the fifth elder seemed to have guessed something.

He covered his mouth and his face was filled with nervousness.

“Yes, I’ve said that once I’ve become a martial saint, the first thing I’ll do is to flatten the Wan clan’s Secret Realm.”Qin Yu’s tone was extremely cold.

When the fifth elder heard this, he could not help but smile bitterly and said, “I really didn’t expect that you’ve grown to such an extent.”

As they spoke, the two of them had already walked to the pavilion master’s building.

“Fifth Elder, I’ll go up first.”Qin Yu greeted the fifth elder. Then, with a shake of his body, he went upstairs.

The pavilion master sat at the edge of the building. She heard the conversation between Qin Yu and the fifth elder clearly.

“Are you really going to the Wan family’s Secret Realm?”Pavilion master asked. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude and said, “I’ve been waiting for this day for a long time.”

Pavilion master said in a deep voice, “After all, the Wan clan’s secret realm is a clan that has been passed down for many years. Such a clan will definitely have a strong foundation to protect the secret realm.”

“No worries,”Qin Yu said.

“The current me will not be afraid of any of their foundations.”

Although Qin Yu’s tone was calm, his words revealed a strong confidence.

“That’s true.”Pavilion master laughed.

“In this world, you are already invincible. Indeed, nothing can stop you.”

Qin Yu did not say a word, but he knew very well in his heart.

The path of cultivation was still very long. The martial saint was not the end at all.

In the Yan family’s secret realm, even mighty figures could only become subordinates. Only the heavens knew how powerful there were still existences in this world.

“Sit.”Pavilion master waved his hand slightly and a chair fell in front of Qin Yu.

The two of them sat opposite each other and talked about the past and the present.

“Your popularity has been quite high recently. They seem to think of you as the new leader,”pavilion master said.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “It’s useless. They don’t know my true strength at all.”

Pavilion master’s beautiful eyes flashed with a trace of surprise.

“You killed Qiao Zun with three punches. Isn’t that enough to prove your strength?”Pavilion master was shocked.

Qin Yu took a sip of tea and shook his head. “I tried to summon them to go with me to conquer the second mystic realm, but the effect was very poor.”

“That’s different. After all, the second mystic realm has been established for many years. It has long been ingrained in people’s hearts,”pavilion master said with a smile.

Qin Yu smiled. “To put it bluntly, they clearly hate the second mystic realm, but they don’t dare to follow me to resist. Either they don’t hate me enough, or they don’t believe me.”

“That’s true.”Pavilion master nodded.

“When I flatten the Wan Clan Mystic Realm, everything will be different,”Qin Yu said indifferently.

Pavilion master hummed in gratitude and continued to ask, “When do you plan to set off?”

“Tomorrow,”Qin Yu said without hesitation.

“Tomorrow, you will go to the Wan clan mystic realm with me.”

“I will personally kill the Wan Gu Qiong in front of you.”

Pavilion master did not express too many opinions regarding this.

“Oh right, where is Senior Xiang Danqing? Didn’t he follow you to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?”At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly asked.

Pavilion master smiled and said, “He is farming on the back mountain and plans to re-mine the medicinal fields.”

“I have to say, Xiang Danqing is a good hand at mining the medicinal fields.”

Qin Yu could not help but smile and said, “This is also good. At least he can share the pressure of the warehouse.”

After saying that, Qin Yu stood up and said, “I won’t stay any longer. I’ll come and pick you up tomorrow.”

“Okay.”Pavilion master nodded.

...

Early the next morning.

Qin Yu gathered three hundred disciples of the Qin sect at the Green Moon Villa and prepared to head to the Wan family’s secret realm.

The three hundred people wore black robes and were full of imposing manner.

“Everyone, listen up.”Qin Yu swept his gaze across the crowd like a general.

“Follow me and set out together to flatten the secret land of the Wan Family!”
