Chapter 644: Could It Be That He Was Qin Yu! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

After raising his head to look at the black-golden light, Qin Yu let out an angry roar. His fist immediately shone with a golden light as he met it head-on!

“Hmph, a swordmentor dares to use his physical strength to fight. He’s simply courting death.”

Seeing this, the few of them couldn’t help but sneer.

One had to know that usually, a swordsman’s physical strength wasn’t that good. One could even call it his weakness!

However, they didn’t expect that the person under the black robe was Qin Yu!

“Clang!”

The moment the fist collided with the black-gold light, the entire ground was instantly filled with dense cracks!

Even the Martial Arts Academy in the distance began to crumble!

Crushed rocks shot out like bullets, and the crackling sounds could be heard continuously!

“Ah!!”

Qin Yu kept roaring. His veins bulged, and his physical strength was pushed to the limit!

“Boom!”

Finally, the black golden ball couldn’t take it anymore and flew back!

The expressions of the few people changed drastically, and they exclaimed, “How is this possible!?”

The smoke and dust dispersed, and Qin Yu’s body was covered in golden light! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

His fist carried a fierce force, and there wasn’t a single scratch on it!

“This kid’s body... how can it be so strong?!” The few of them had ugly expressions on their faces!

“Golden light... strong body... why does this black-robed man look so similar to the deceased Qin Yu?!”

“Impossible, Qin Yu is already dead. He died long ago!”

“Who exactly are you? What do you have to do with Qin Yu?!”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He stomped on the ground, and with the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist in his hand, he shot toward the few of them!

They didn’t dare to be negligent and immediately clenched their fists to receive the attack.

They had the protection of the Black Gold Stone, so they naturally wouldn’t be afraid of Qin Yu!

“Clang!”

The moment the fists collided, the Black Gold Stone immediately buzzed!

Even though the Black Gold Stone protected their fists, the huge impact force forced them back!

“How is this possible!? His physical strength is actually comparable to the Black Gold Stone!” When they saw this, they immediately turned pale with fright!

Qin Yu seized the opportunity, and his fists smashed down like raindrops!

This was the first time Qin Yu had used his physical strength to fight after he had stepped into the fourth level Martial Marquis Realm!

Even Qin Yu hadn’t expected himself to have such terrifying power!

The black-gold robe powerhouses were continuously pushed back by Qin Yu, and the Black Gold Stone armor on their bodies began to collapse!

Their bodyies suffered a huge impact force, and the force penetrated through the Black Gold Stone armor!

After a series of indiscriminate bombardments, the black-gold robe powerhouse fell to the ground while bleeding profusely.

The black-gold armor on his body collapsed in many places. Although it couldn’t be shattered, it had already shocked everyone!

“He could actually beat the Black Gold Stone to such an extent... how could the strength of this kid’s body be so terrifying?!” A trace of solemnity flashed across their faces!

According to the information they had received, this black-robed man was only a swordsman. That was why they had prepared a disk magic artifact!

However, they didn’t expect that this person’s physical strength would be so powerful to such an extent!

Qin Yu took a deep breath, and a trace of solemnity once again appeared on his face.

“As expected of the Black Gold Stone. Even a fourth-grade Martial Marquis wouldn’t be able to break it.” Qin Yu frowned.

If he had used the bronze sword, he would have been able to shatter the Black Gold Stone! Unfortunately, he couldn’t use it at all.

“Everyone, don’t waste any more time. Hurry up and kill him!”

At this moment, the remaining seven black-gold robe powerhouses said coldly.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to be negligent. He immediately turned around and looked at these people.

Their expressions were somewhat solemn, and the internal qi on their bodies was rapidly rising.

“Supreme Divine Chant!”

At this moment, one of the black-gold robe powerhouses suddenly opened his mouth, and a strange voice came from his mouth!

In that instant, Qin Yu felt his entire brain buzzing. He was in a daze, and his divine sense seemed to have received a huge impact!

Another divine sense attack! This person’s voice seemed to contain an extremely powerful divine sense attack, causing Qin Yu to fall into a momentary state of disorientation!

In a life-and-death battle, victory and defeat could be decided in just a second!

“Heavenly Lightning!” Taking advantage of this, another person activated a spell!

Muffled thunder condensed in the sky and poured down on Qin Yu’s body!

“Spirit Light Buddha Hand!”

“Scarlet Sun Boom!”

“Swimming Dragon Sacred Saber!”

In just a split second, several people activated their spells at the same time and smashed toward Qin Yu!

“Boom!”

A few spells exploded on Qin Yu’s body and smashed him to the ground!

A huge pit appeared in the ground, and Qin Yu’s body was smashed several meters into the ground!

“Golden Bell Thunder!”

They struck while the iron was hot, and the spells in their hands condensed again.

“Boom!”

The huge pit seemed to be buried with thousands of bombs, and it almost blew the ground apart!

Dust rose up in the surroundings, and many bloody marks appeared on Qin Yu’s body!

His white bones were exposed, and it was a horrible sight!

Qin Yu climbed out of the pit with great difficulty. He looked at the people in front of him, and his expression became colder and colder.

“If this continues... I will really die here.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

At this moment, Qin Yu couldn’t care about anything else.

His mouth opened slightly, and his eyes instantly turned scarlet red. The symbol of the divine dragon seal appeared on his forehead!

At this moment, Qin Yu’s internal qi was instantly adjusted to the extreme. The toughness of his physical strength far surpassed that of steel!

Under the augmentation of the Saintly Body Technique, Qin Yu’s body shone with golden light!

“Huh? What kind of technique is this?” When the few of them saw this scene, their expressions couldn’t help but change!

For some reason, the black-robed man in front of them seemed to become more and more familiar!

A golden body, scarlet eyes, and an incomparably fierce fist...

“Why does this person seem so similar to Qin Yu!”

“Could it be that he is Qin Yu?”

“Impossible! Qin Yu is only in his early thirties. He is younger than us. It is impossible for him to have such strength!”

“This person is probably Qin Yu’s mentor!”

Just as they were guessing, Qin Yu had already used Shrinking Ground Into An Inch as he shot over explosively!

“Boom!”

His fist was extremely fast, leaving afterimages in the air!

This punch smashed into his lower abdomen!

The black-gold robe powerhouse’s body instantly turned into a shrimp-like shape. His eyeballs almost popped out!

Qin Yu didn’t stop there. He clasped his hands together and ruthlessly smashed toward his spine!

“Kacha!”

This crushing force smashed his body into a strange arc, and then he rapidly fell downwards!

His spine was actually shattered!

“Oh no! This person’s physical strength is beyond our imagination!” They cried out in alarm!

Upon seeing this, the few of them once again activated their spells!

But this time, Qin Yu clenched his golden fist to meet it!

“Boom!”

After the huge explosion, that scarlet disc was smashed into pieces by Qin Yu!

The terrifying fist arrived in front of them in the blink of an eye!

“Bang!”

This fist smashed into his face!

In an instant, his nose was shattered, and his facial bones caved in!

“What a terrifying body...” Seeing this, the few people turned pale with fright!

Qin Yu said coldly, “As expected of the black-gold robe powerhouse of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. This punch actually didn’t break your head!”
