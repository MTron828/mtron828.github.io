2147 Yan Ruoxue’s Madness

Yan Ruoxue smiled faintly. The spiritual power around her surged like the sea tides, directly breaking through the binding technique cast by the two linen-robed elderly men.

The expression of the two linen-robed elderly men instantly changed drastically. They obviously did not expect Yan Ruoxue to be able to break their binding technique so easily. The shock in their hearts could not be described in words. It was something they could not understand. Yan Ruoxue’s strength was actually so powerful.

“As expected of the saintess of the Yan family, it’s indeed quite impressive.” The linen-robed elderly man seemed to be a little angry out of embarrassment.

After all, they were True Saints. If they attacked intending to kill Yan Ruoxue, Yan Ruoxue definitely could not win.

However, Yan Ruoxue was the saintess after all. They had concerns in their hearts, but now that things have come to this point, they could not care less anymore.

Seeing the internal qi of the two True Saints become increasingly terrifying, Qin Yu suddenly felt a hint of unease.

He struggled to get up and shield Yan Ruoxue with all his might.

Qin Yu supported his body and gritted his teeth as he said, “The person you are looking for is me. It has nothing to do with Ruoxue. I will go with you…”

The two linen-robed elderly men heaved a sigh of relief. Unless it was absolutely necessary, they naturally did not want to offend Yan Ruoxue.

“No, I’ve already said it. With me around, I will never let you get hurt!” Yan Ruoxue said coldly.

Before Qin Yu could say anything, Yan Ruoxue pushed Qin Yu to her back and sealed a few of Qin Yu’s vitality gates with her finger, making Qin Yu not able to move.

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu’s heart felt like it was being cut by a knife, overwhelmed with unbearable pain. However, he was too severely injured and could not reopen the seal on his vitality gates. He could only watch as Yan Ruoxue faced two True Saints alone.

“Ruoxue…” Qin Yu opened his mouth, and tears welled up in his eyes.

At this moment, Yan Ruoxue raised both of her hands and thousands of dao techniques gathered in an instant!

With just a move by raising the hand, the entire Astral Mountain began to rumble!

“Immortal Emperor Tianming’s Destiny Reincarnation Secret Technique…” A linen-robed elderly man recognized the technique, and Qin Yu by the side naturally also recognized it!

Back then, Yan Ruoxue passed this technique to Qin Yu and told him not to use it unless it was absolutely necessary. Otherwise, the Yan family would pay any price at all to get rid of Qin Yu!

And this mystical technique allowed one to forcefully preserve one’s life nine times! With each rebirth, one’s strength would be greatly enhanced!

It was also not impossible for Yan Ruoxue to step into the True Saint Realm with this secret technique!

“Saintess Yan, are you seriously going to do this?” a linen-robed elderly man said with a solemn expression.

However, Yan Ruoxue did not give them a damn. She raised her palm and slowly activated the Destiny Reincarnation Secret Technique!

The Destiny Reincarnation Secret Technique was mysterious and powerful. It originated from the secret technique of Immortal Emperor Tianming and was regarded as the highest profundity of dao techniques!

As for Immortal Emperor Tianming, he had been hailed as one of the strongest Immortal Emperors many times. His techniques were even more unfathomable!

When Yan Ruoxue activated this technique, an endless amount of spiritual power of heaven and earth surged from all directions and gathered toward her.

A small ball of light suddenly appeared between her hands. There seemed to be strange rules contained within the ball of light. Such rules possessed an extremely terrifying subversive nature that affected both heaven and earth.

It distorted time and space and even blurred the surrounding environment in an instant.

It was like a rising sun, emitting a warm light that was difficult for people to look directly at it.

Yan Ruoxue looked extremely dignified in the light. Her gaze was tremendously firm and resolute as if everything was under her control.

“Saintess Yan, you have to think twice!” the linen-robed elderly man advised loudly.

However, Yan Ruoxue did not respond to him. She slowly pushed her palm forward, and the small ball of light moved along with her palm, slowly floating in front of her.

Suddenly, the ball of light burst out with a shocking light. It was like a newborn sun, making people unable to look directly at it.

As the light burst, the spiritual power around Yan Ruoxue surged like a tide and resonated with the light ball mysteriously.

At this moment, Yan Ruoxue’s body suddenly trembled. A powerful life force gushed out of her body. It was the mysterious power of the Destiny Reincarnation Secret Technique. It could instantly raise her life force to the limit, allowing Yan Ruoxue to reach an unprecedented level with the double improvement of her life force and spiritual power.

Under Yan Ruoxue’s control, the ball of light gradually expanded. It absorbed the surrounding spiritual power and kept growing until it was big enough to fully surround Yan Ruoxue.

In that ball of light, Yan Ruoxue’s body seemed to be undergoing a rebirth. Her skin became fairer, and her injuries were recovering rapidly. Even her internal qi was becoming stronger.

The Destiny Reincarnation Secret Technique completed Yan Ruoxue’s rebirth. Walking out of the ball of light, her internal qi became extremely powerful, and even the two linen-robed elderly men felt a powerful pressure.

At this moment, Yan Ruoxue’s internal qi was powerful, solemn, and sacred. No one dared to look at her directly.

Even the two True Saints had ugly expressions on their faces.

Even True Saint would feel pressured under such an internal qi!

“Saintess Yan, we…”

The linen-robed elderly man was about to dissuade Yan Ruoxue when she suddenly raised her snow-white palm and slapped it toward him!

“Bang!”

This palm seemed to have used up all its strength and instantly shattered Yan Ruoxue’s near-perfect body!

“Ruoxue!” Seeing this scene, Qin Yu’s tears gushed out. He roared with all his might, but he could not do anything!

“Saintess Yan, you…”

Everyone understood Yan Ruoxue’s intentions now! She wanted to kill and revive herself, allowing her strength to reach the highest limit!

This was naturally the fastest way to increase her strength, but this method was too cruel. Even Immortal Emperor Tianming had never used it.

But now, to protect Qin Yu, Yan Ruoxue was willing to shatter her own body to be reborn!

A moment later, Yan Ruoxue’s body slowly walked out of the ball of light.

This time, Yan Ruoxue’s internal qi became even stronger and added a bit of sacred internal qi to her.

However, Yan Ruoxue still did not intend to make a move. Her eyes were tremendously cold, and her killing intent surged, making the entire Astral Mountain as cold and bleak as the depths of winter.

“I’ve said it… I’ll definitely kill the two of you!” Following Yan Ruoxue’s cold words, she raised her palm again and slapped herself. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Yan Ruoxue died for the second time.

This pain was self-evident as if falling into the eighteen levels of hell.

Even the two linen-robed elderly men were shocked.

“Is it worth it for this brat…” a linen-robed elderly man said coldly.

They could only watch as Yan Ruoxue revived for the second time. This time, her internal qi was like a vast ocean that could not be seen through.
