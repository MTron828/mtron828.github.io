Chapter 1017: Chapter 1,017, submit to me 

He sneered with a hint of mockery in his eyes.

After Hua Zongxiong appeared, the surrounding disciples hurriedly bowed and shouted, “Greetings, sect master!”

Seeing this scene, Hua Zongxiong couldn’t stop laughing.

“Qin Yu, did you see that? Now, the entire Heaven Gate belongs to me!”Hua zongxiong sneered.

“I believe that no one is willing to follow a sect master who ran away at the last minute.” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Qin Yu looked at Hua zongxiong coldly and said, “I think no one is willing to follow a sect master who kneels on the ground and begs for mercy.”

Hearing that, Hua Zongxiong couldn’t help but sneer, “Are you talking about yourself? It’s still not too late for you to kneel down and beg for mercy.”

“I don’t want to talk nonsense with you. I still have big things to do. Let’s end this quickly,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Hua zongxiong narrowed his eyes and sneered, “I also have the same intention!”

Before he finished his words, Hua Zongxiong’s pupils suddenly shrank!

He saw Qin Yu’s figure disappear on the spot, and many afterimages shot toward him!

When he came back to his senses, Qin Yu had already punched through his chest!

His palm went through his chest and out from the back!

Hua zongxiong lowered his head to look at his own chest, his eyes filled with disbelief.

“You...”Hua Zongxiong stared at Qin Yu, his expression changing drastically!

Qin Yu pulled out his fist and said coldly, “I wanted to kill you, but actually it was only a breath’s time. But in order to convince the public, I decided to give you a chance.”

After saying that, Qin Yu put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “If you have any moves, just use them.”

Hua Zongxiong was instantly enraged! He said coldly, “Kid, you’re too arrogant!”

As he spoke, the aura on Hua Zongxiong’s body rapidly rose!

Following that, Hua Zongxiong’s feet shook and he shot toward Qin Yu explosively!

His body emitted a faint light, and his fists were like raindrops, continuously smashing toward Qin Yu with crackling sounds!

On the other hand, Qin Yu still had his hands behind his back, and his body was emitting a faint light, allowing Hua Zongxiong’s fist to land on his body.

For a moment, the sound of Peng Peng Peng was incessant!

The ground under Qin Yu’s feet was shattered, but Hua Zongxiong’s fist was still unable to penetrate this level of golden light!

After a series of attacks, Hua Zongxiong was so tired that he was gasping for breath, but Qin Yu still did not move an inch.

“Impossible!”Hua Zongxiong was instantly enraged and increased the intensity of his attacks once again!

Right at this moment, Qin Yu’s eyes turned cold. He casually waved his large hand, and a terrifying force directly struck onto Hua Zongxiong’s body!

In an instant, Hua Zongxiong was directly sent flying hundreds of meters, and even shattered the Heaven Gate’s city wall!

His body was smashed into the ground by the ruins, and everyone could not help but be dumbstruck!

He sent Hua Zongxiong flying with just one palm? What kind of strength was this? ! The Almighty Realm? !

“Ah! ! !”

At this moment, Hua Zongxiong’s furious roar came from under the ruins!

Hua Zongxiong was covered in blood, and his body was faintly emitting a strange light!

“Brat, you have completely infuriated me!”Hua Zongxiong roared again and again!

The mark between his brows flickered and shone at this moment, and behind Hua Zongxiong, the figure of a brown bear faintly appeared!

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but raise his brows and sneered, “So you’ve obtained a Demon Beast Spirit Pill, and it’s a brown bear.”

Hua Zongxiong glared at Qin Yu and said, “Qin Yu, I’m going to tear you into pieces!”

After using the brown bear’s power, Hua Zongxiong’s strength instantly increased by dozens of times! With every move, the earth shook and the mountains shook!

“Go to hell!”

Accompanied by Hua Zongxiong’s furious roar, he shot towards Qin Yu again!

This time, his strength became incomparably powerful, but his speed did not decrease at all!

Qin Yu’s body swayed slightly, and every punch of Hua Zongxiong was easily dodged by Qin Yu!

Hua Zongxiong seemed to have gone mad and almost destroyed the entire Heaven Gate!

Seeing this, Qin Yu could not help but frown and said, “It was not easy to build the Heaven Gate. I Can’t let you destroy it.”

His tone was casual, but it was full of arrogance!

“Go to hell!”Hua Brown Bear roared angrily and punched at Qin Yu!

The brown bear behind him seemed to have also stretched out its fist at this moment and smashed at Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed, and both of his arms flickered with golden light!

“I’ll let you experience what true power is,”Qin Yu said coldly.

As soon as he finished speaking, Qin Yu clenched his fist and faced Hua Zongxiong’s fist!

That fist that flickered with golden light instantly illuminated the entire world!

“Bang!”

Finally, the two fists collided!

The expected stalemate did not occur!

At the instant of the collision, Hua Zongxiong’s entire arm was directly shattered!

That enormous penetrating force blasted towards Hua Zongxiong’s entire body!

In an instant, Hua Zongxiong’s body was directly shattered! Fresh blood dripped down, and his bones were even shattered into powder!

His body shot backwards rapidly, and it was unknown how long it took before he stabilized his body!

When everyone saw this scene, they could not help but swallow their saliva!

This... The Gap was too big!

Hua zongxiong fell to the ground. His internal Qi was weak and he could no longer stand up.

Qin Yu walked straight to him and said coldly, “Do you know that there is also a huge difference between a martial saint and a martial saint?”

Hua zongxiong rolled his throat as if he wanted to say something. However, Qin Yu did not give him the chance to do so and directly crushed his primordial spirit!

Hua zongxiong, who was known to be invincible, died just like that.

This ‘great battle’only lasted for less than ten minutes before Hua Zongxiong turned into a skeleton.

Qin Yu turned around and coldly swept his gaze towards the crowd.

When the two martial saints following Hua Zongxiong saw that the situation was not good, they immediately knelt down and shouted, “Greetings sect leader Qin! We are willing to follow sect leader for Life!”

When everyone saw this, they also hurriedly knelt down and shouted, “Greetings sect leader Qin, we are willing to follow sect leader for our entire lives!”

Thousands of people shouted in unison, their voices shaking the sky!
