Chapter 222: Hui Ming’s Trick Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s environment became colder and colder, and the surrounding trees had completely withered.

Winter was about to arrive, and with the dark energy in Qin Yu’s body, the environment looked exceptionally desolate.

In the room, Yao Qing stood quietly by the window and looked at Qin Yu.

He wanted to cultivate according to the breathing exercise method taught by Qin Yu, but he found that the spiritual energy seemed to be suppressed and he was unable to advance at all. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Mr. Qin’s cultivation method... seems a bit strange,” Yao Qing whispered.

On the other side, Jiang Gu was sitting in the living room quietly waiting for Mr. Zhong.

However, half a minute later, a corpse was brought in.

“Master, Mr. Zhong... he’s dead!” The Jiang family’s servant, his face full of panic, kneeled on the ground.

It was Mr. Zhong lying on the ground.

He laid quietly on the ground, and his whole body seemed to have shriveled up.

“Mr. Zhong!” Seeing this scene, Jiang Gu felt like his heart was being cut by a knife!

He held Mr. Zhong’s corpse and his face was full of anguish.

Mr. Zhong had followed Jiang Gu for dozens of years, and these years, he had been working diligently and loyally for the Jiang family.

Therefore, Jiang Gu’s relationship with him was extremely deep!

Even when the Jiang family was implicated because of Mr. Zhong’s mistake last time, Jiang Gu couldn’t bring himself to kill him!

“Who did it?!” Jiang Gu’s eyes were bloodshot as he said angrily.

Before his subordinates could answer, Jiang Gu’s phone rang.

After the call was connected, a gloomy voice came from the other end.

“Mr. Jiang, did you receive the gift I gave you?” This voice was Hui Ming’s!

Jiang Gu’s expression suddenly changed and he shouted angrily, “It was you! I will tear you into pieces!”

“Tear me into pieces?” Hui Ming laughed out loud on the other end.

“Mr. Jiang, don’t be anxious. You can make a decision after you watch the video,” Hui Ming said nonchalantly.

After saying that, he directly dialed the number.

Not long after, Jiang Gu received a text message on his phone.

On the text message, there was a video, and in the video, Jiang Yu’s entire body was covered in black energy. His lips were purple, and he looked like he was in imminent danger!

“Son!” Jiang Gu’s pupils dilated, and his face turned pale!

At the right time, a call came in again.

“Mr. Jiang, your son has been poisoned by me, as long as I want him to, he will die without a doubt.” Hui Ming said indifferently.

Jiang Gu shouted anxiously, “What do you want to do?! Don’t hurt my son!”

“Hahaha!” Hui Ming couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“If you don’t want anything to happen to your son, you’d better cooperate with me obediently,” Hui Ming said with a cold smile.

At this moment, Jiang Gu was completely flustered.

Jiang Haoran was already dead, and Jiang Yu had already become the only child of the Jiang family!

Although Jiang Yu was a good-for-nothing, he was still Jiang Gu’s biological son! How could Jiang Gu not be anxious?!

All parents in the world love their children!

“I’ll promise you anything. Don’t touch my son!” Jiang Gu said anxiously.

Hui Ming smiled nonchalantly and said, “You should have done this before. Jiang Gu, don’t worry. After the matter is settled, I promise to let the Jiang family become the number one family in Chuzhou once again.”

After saying this, Hui Ming hung up the phone.

Jiang Gu was anxious, but he had no way at all.

The Earth Fiend Valley was sinister and vicious, and their methods were even more bizarre. Even Jiang Gu had no solution at all.

...

Time flew by.

Another three days passed.

Qin Yu’s phone rang several times, but no one picked up.

Because at this moment, Qin Yu was trying to break through to the seventh level of the Foundation Establishment Stage!

He seemed to have reached his bottleneck stage. Although the dark energy was surging with endless supply, his strength couldn’t advance any further.

“Swish!”

Finally, Qin Yu opened his eyes.

He couldn’t help but let out a deep breath, and his eyes emitted traces of dark light.

Qin Yu looked around and suddenly found that there seemed to be some changes in his eyes.

He turned his head to look at Yao Qing, and was surprised to find that his gaze seemed to be able to see through Yao Qing!

“Could it be that this is also a talent?” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Every time one advanced in the Foundation Establishment Stage, it would allow the cultivator’s talent to be revealed bit by bit.

For example, Qin Yu’s spiritual fire and his tough physical body.

The current change in his eyes was also the same.

Qin Yu lowered his head to look at his own body and muttered in a low voice, “It seems that the sixth level of the Foundation Establishment Stage is already my bottleneck.”

Other than the resources required for cultivation, the more important thing was the state of mind.

Many disciples of great families didn’t have talent. Even if they had abundant herbs every day, it would be useless.

The improvement of the state of mind was relatively more important.

“It seems that I have to continue to deceive that old b*stard for a period of time.” Qin Yu sighed.

Thinking of the ancestor of the Earth Fiend Valley, Qin Yu was filled with anger.

“Mr. Qin.”

At this moment, Yao Qing walked over from outside.

Qin Yu nodded at him and said, “How long have I been in seclusion this time?”

Yao Qing said, “It’s already been thirteen days.”

“How long.” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Fortunately, his strength had been greatly improved.

Although it was only at level three, there was a drastic difference.

“Now, if I were to fight against Jiang Gu, perhaps it wouldn’t be so strenuous anymore.” Qin Yu clenched his fist and thought to himself.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s phone rang again.

After picking up the phone, Qin Yu saw that the caller was Jiang Gu.

Qin Yu didn’t think too much about it and immediately picked up the phone.

On the other end, Jiang Gu said in an awkward voice, “Mr. ... Mr. Qin, do you have time? I want to treat you to a meal.”

“Treat me to a meal?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

“What’s the matter?”

Jiang Gu said with some hesitation, “There’s... there’s something I need to tell you.”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, then he agreed, “Okay, I’ll be there in a while.”

After hanging up the phone, Qin Yu couldn’t help but touch his chin.

Jiang Gu sounded a little strange...

After a simple shower, Qin Yu went out and rushed to the Jiang family.

At this moment, there were seven to eight corpses lying in front of Hui Ming.

These corpses were all shriveled up and looked extremely terrifying.

And they were all the elite forces of the Jiang family! Their strength had already reached the Inner Strength Past Master realm!

“How comfortable. It’s really comfortable...” Hui Ming licked his lips with a satisfied expression.

Jiang Gu was extremely furious, but he didn’t dare to say anything.

“Qin Yu has already agreed. He should be arriving soon,” Jiang Gu said with a cold expression.

“Remember to return my son after the matter is done.”

“If my son loses a hair, I will never forgive you!”

Hui Ming smiled nonchalantly and said, “Mr. Jiang, don’t worry. I, Hui Ming, am a man of my word.”

“I hope so.” Jiang Gu snorted coldly and then left with a flick of his sleeve.

Hui Ming sneered again and again. The dark energy on his body surged. He slowly raised his palm, and instantly, waves of black energy gushed out from nine directions!

“How dare you snatch my things, Qin Yu. This time, I want you to die without a burial ground!” Hui Ming said sinisterly.

Soon, Qin Yu drove to the Jiang family’s residence.

Jiang Gu had been waiting at the door for a long time ago. When he saw Qin Yu arrive, an awkward look flashed across Jiang Gu’s face.
