2206 The Nine Trigrams of Destiny

“The Blades of the Ten Directions itself is a supreme killing formation. Compared to Wang Feng’s three ordinary formations, it’s a higher-level formation. For Wang Feng to use three ordinary formations to block this supreme killing formation, his attainment in formations has been at the peak. If Wang Feng had learned an even more profound formation, the other party probably wouldn’t be a match for him.”

Qin Yu said softly. With a glance, he already had a clear judgment of the two.

The sword aurora continued to attack the saber, and the two parties collided nearly a hundred times in just a few seconds.

Although Wang Feng’s iron saber had been passively defending, it had not been defeated by the “incredible” formation.

As the swordsman’s aura deceased, the saber light of the iron saber suddenly flashed across.

The iron saber instantly changed from defensive to offensive, and its aura soared to the extreme.

The saber slashed vertically, and the iron sword was cut into two.

“I won!”

Wang Feng roared and swung his fist in the air.

Looking blankly at the flying sword that had fallen to the ground, the young man stared at Wang Feng with a face full of hatred.

“How did I lose to this low-level Formation Master!”

He was from a formation aristocratic family on the Black Platform Continent and had learned formations under the guidance of his family teacher since he was young.

He did not expect to have lost to this unknown rogue cultivator.

“I haven’t lost yet!”

His eye expression turned fierce, and a powerful divine sense entered the flying sword.

The two sections of the flying sword exploded with a sword aura that was dozens of times stronger than before and attacked Wang Feng.

“Referee! He’s cheating!”

Wang Feng’s expression changed drastically as he shouted.

His cultivation was in the Middle-stage of the Mighty Realm. Therefore there was a big gap between him and the young man in the Reversion Void Stage.

Generally, the use of magical artifacts in the artifact refining competition only allowed using the divine sense of the same realm. Otherwise, it would lose the meaning of the competition.

But the young man had actually forcefully used his Reversion Void Stage divine sense to kill Wang Feng.

“There are no rules to suppress one’s cultivation realm when competing in this competition. One’s strength is also one of the judging criteria of the master refiner.”

The head of the Xue family stood up, coughed, and said.

“I admit defeat!”

Wang Feng revealed a look of fear. This flying sword was coming to take his life!

“Die!”

The young man’s eyes revealed a vicious expression. He activated his flying sword with a ferocious expression and was about to kill Wang Feng.

Those who were more talented than him must die!

As for the referees, they continued talking, turning blind eyes to what was happening in the arena.

Wang Feng looked at the flying sword and closed his eyes in despair.

Qin Yu flicked his index finger, and a stream of air instantly blasted the two sections of the flying swords into fine powder.

“Who is it?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The young man spat a mouthful of blood and looked around in exasperation.

“The champion is Wang Feng.”

Qin Yu moved and came to the arena. He said indifferently.

“Who do you think you are? How dare you come here and give instructions? You were the one who created trouble just now, right?”

The young man shouted with a ferocious expression.

“Slap!”

The head of the Xue family slapped the young man’s face fiercely, sending him flying.

“Uncle Xue, didn’t you say the championship was mine?”

The young man stared at the head of the Xue family with an aggrieved expression.

“Quickly get lost! Shut your mouth!”

The moment he saw Qin Yu, his pupils constricted.

He had just learned from the City Lord that the massive commotion in the first half of the month was caused by this young man who was like Asura in front of him.

He was the person who faced the experts who ranked among the top in the city. How could he dare to refute Qin Yu at this moment?

“I announce that the champion is Wang Feng!”

The head of the Xue family said loudly.

“Thank you, Big Brother!”

Not knowing who Qin Yu was, Wang Feng cupped his hands to express his gratitude.

Qin Yu shook his head to indicate that it was fine. He took out a pill.

“Take this and recuperate well. The spiritual power in your body has already been exhausted. If this continues, I’m afraid you’ll die.”

“Are you a master alchemist?”

Wang Feng was stunned.

“You may say so. In fact, I have also done some research on formation.”

Qin Yu nodded.

“Great! Big brother must come to my place and study it properly. I can see that Big Brother’s strength is not simple, and your attainments in formations should not be bad.”

When Wang Feng heard that Qin Yu knew formation, he instantly became spirited. He forcefully pulled Qin Yu to his cultivation base.

“This is your cultivation base?”

The corners of Qin Yu’s mouth twitched. Not long after, they arrived at the cultivation base that Wang Feng had mentioned.

There was almost no spiritual energy here. The surroundings were barren mountains and wilderness. The bare spiritual energy seemed to be unable to attract even animals.

Qin Yu suddenly understood Wang Feng’s current physical condition. In this place, even if he cultivated, it would probably be hard to replenish the spiritual energy he needed.

“It can’t be helped. The reputable land with abundant spiritual energy has already been divided equally among the aristocratic families. It’s been tremendously hard to survive in these wild mountains. There are still many ordinary people living like grass.”

Wang Feng shook his head.

“Watch out!”

He suddenly exclaimed.

Seeing a place where there was a vague accumulation of explosive spiritual energy, Qin Yu stepped into it.

It unexpectedly triggered the thunder and fire.

In an instant, lightning and fire erupted within the formation.

Qin Yu waved his hand, and all the lightning and fire instantly dispersed.

The ground was carved with densely packed formations. Qin Yu’s divine sense swept over, and it was actually hard to see everything within a short time.

“I’m sorry for the embarrassment, Big Brother. Three hundred years ago, I was just an ordinary person. I was lucky enough to obtain an introductory formation book and use it to enter the dao. That’s how I barely acquired the ability I have today.”

Wang Feng smiled and said in embarrassment.

Qin Yu was somewhat shocked. Entering the dao with formations was even more difficult in such a barren land.

Although these formations were all basic, there was actually a rarely seen Five United Formation.

The previous Purgatory Formation was merely a Five United Formation. If the man before him were in a higher realm and had more resources, his talent would be even more terrifying than some geniuses in the Holy Region.

“Big brother, please take a seat. It’s a technique I comprehended after studying formation for many years. I call it Destiny Divination.”

Wang Feng suddenly closed his eyes. And when he opened his eyes…

The internal qi on his body suddenly became ancient and awe-inspiring, and his eye expression turned grayish-white.

Qin Yu’s pupils suddenly constricted. His eye expression was like a mirror, reflecting his figure.

An extremely dangerous sensation enveloped Qin Yu’s divine sense. That feeling was not of the present but of the future.

Then, a sea of blood appeared in Wang Feng’s eyes. Skulls floated in the sea of blood, and ghost shadows flickered. Qin Yu was standing in it.

Wang Feng’s face suddenly turned pale as paper, and suddenly he spat a mouthful of blood essence.

“That’s enough!”

Qin Yu’s expression changed. He abruptly interrupted Wang Feng’s technique.

A surge of pure spiritual energy surged into Wang Feng’s dantian, and then Qin Yu grabbed a pill and put it into Wang Feng’s mouth.

After some time, Wang Feng opened his eyes.

“Call me Qin Yu. This divination of yours is already very close to the Tribulation Transcendence Stage that you can comprehend my destiny from the void.”
