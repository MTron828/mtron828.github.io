Chapter 877: Chapter 877, opening the ownerless secret realm 

Qin Yu looked at ye Qing and said, “Officer Ye, are you sure that he will help? Or rather, are you sure that he is reliable?”

Ye Qing blew out a smoke ring and said, “He is an old friend of mine for many years. Of course, there is no problem.”

Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief and immediately got out of the car.

The two of them walked into the Secret Realm Master’s house together.

Qin Yu swept his gaze over the decoration style of the surroundings. There was a huge calligraphy painting hanging on the north side, and a magic artifact on the south side.

Other than that, Qin Yu also found countless secret treasures, materials, and other things in the courtyard.

Looking at the luxurious surroundings, Qin Yu did not say anything. He followed ye Qing into the hall.

In the hall, an old man was making tea.

He had a head full of white hair and a long beard. He looked like an immortal.

Ye Qing brought Qin Yu to him quickly and said, “This is master Jiang Nan.”

Qin Yu quickly bowed and said, “Greetings, master Jiang.”

Jiang nan nodded slightly and then looked at ye Qing and said with a smile, “Officer Ye doesn’t visit the Three Treasures Palace for no reason. If you have something to say, just say it.”

Ye Qing did not stand on ceremony. He pointed at Qin Yu and expressed his intention to come.

“You want a Mystic Realm Master?”Jiang nan frowned slightly.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “That’s right. If master Jiang can help, I will be extremely grateful.”

Jiang nan sized up Qin Yu and said, “What do you want a mystic realm master for?”

“I want to open an ownerless mystic realm,”Qin Yu said.

Jiang nan continued, “Master-less secret realm? where is that master-less secret realm?”

Just as Qin Yu was about to open his mouth, his eyes rolled and he said with a smile, “On the South Island.”

“South Island?”Jiang Nan was silent for a moment, and then he said with a smile, “I’m old, and I don’t care about the world anymore.”

Ye Qing patted Jiang Nan’s shoulder and said, “What? Do I have to beg you for such a small thing? Let me tell you, this is not my intention alone.”

Although ye Qing did not say it explicitly, his intention was very obvious.

Jiang Nan knew better than anyone what kind of person he represented behind his back.

“Hehe, since officer ye has said so, then I can’t just sit idly by,”Jiang Nan said with a smile.

Then, Jiang Nan waved his hand and a young man walked out from the darkness.

“Master.”The young man walked to Jiang Nan’s side and bowed slightly.

Jiang nan nodded and introduced, “This is my disciple, Li Yu. He has mastered more than 8,000 secret keys. He can open most of the secret realms.”

“If you don’t mind, let him follow you.”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said in surprise, “Mr. Jiang, is what you said true?”

“Since officer ye has spoken, it wouldn’t make sense if I didn’t do something,”Jiang Nan said with a smile.

Qin Yu quickly cupped his hands to Jiang nan and said, “Thank you, Mr. Jiang.”

Jiang nan grunted and said, “You guys go back first. I’ll ask Li Yu to look for you tomorrow.”

“Okay.”Qin Yu nodded and agreed.

Then, ye Qing and Jiang Nan greeted each other and the two of them walked out of the Jiang family.

After getting into the car, Qin Yu said in a low voice, “Officer Ye, I still have to ask again. Is this Mr. Jiang Reliable?”

Ye Qing glanced at Qin Yu and said, “If you don’t trust him, you can go and find a mystic realm master yourself.”

“That’s not what I mean.”Qin Yu shook his head.

“I always feel that things are too smooth, and...”

“And what?”Ye Qing asked.

Qin Yu shook his head and said with a smile, “Maybe I’m thinking too much.”

“I’ll ask Li Yu to look for you tomorrow,”ye Qing said with a wave of his hand.

Qin Yu grunted and said no more.

At this time, in the Jiang family’s hall, Jiang Nan slowly stood up.

He put his hands behind his back and quietly said, “You should have heard about who this person is.”

Li Yu bowed and said, “Qin Yu, the enemy of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

“That’s right.”Jiang nan nodded.

“Now that I’ve placed you by his side, you can control all of his movements.”

“Whether it’s the location of his secret realm or the secret key.”

Li Yu quickly said, “Master, do you mean that you want me to tell the Jingdu martial arts association the location of the Secret Realm?”

“No.”Jiang Nan shook his head.

“I can hear it from ye Qing’s words. The people above seem to support Qin Yu.”

“If Qin Yu can win, then naturally, everyone will be happy. If he shows his dispirited state, we can immediately join the Jingdu Martial Arts Association and get rid of Qin Yu!”

“In this way, we will be in an invincible position!”

Li Yu suddenly came to a realization and hurriedly nodded. “Master, I understand.”

...

On the other side, Qin Yu temporarily found a hotel to stay in.

He sat in his room, thinking about it and feeling that something was not right.

This Jiang Nan seemed to be aloof from worldly affairs, but his home was filled with all kinds of rare treasures, as well as calligraphy and paintings. He definitely did not seem like an old man who was aloof from worldly affairs.

Moreover... It was impossible for the JINGDU martial arts association not to know about such a powerful mystic realm master.

Although ye Qing trusted Jiang Nan very much, most of ye Qing’s attention was on the military district after all, and he had long been indifferent to the martial arts world.

“Although I can’t trust him, it seems that there’s no other way.”Qin Yu sighed slightly.

It was too difficult to find a mystic realm master, and it was almost impossible to find a trustworthy mystic realm master.

“I have to think of a way to restrain him,”Qin Yu said in his heart.

The next day, ye Qing brought Li Yu to Qin Yu’s residence.

“I’ll leave him to you,”ye Qing said in a deep voice.

“As for what you should do, that’s your own business.”

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude and then said, “Thank you, Officer Ye.”

Ye Qing did not stay any longer. After sending Li Yu off, he left in a hurry.

Qin Yu did not waste any time. He immediately brought Li Yu and rushed towards the Jade Moon Villa.

After arriving at the Green Moon Villa, Li Yu asked in puzzlement, “Didn’t you say that the ownerless mystic realm is on the South Island?”

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “That’s right. The South Island is only one of the ownerless Mystic Realms.”

“Two ownerless Mystic Realms?”This made Li Yu somewhat surprised.

Qin Yu did not pay attention to this sentence. He brought Jiang Nan all the way to the spirit spring.

At this time, there were still many cultivators cultivating near the spirit spring.

After Qin Yu first expelled all the people, he brought Li Yu to the vicinity of the ownerless Mystic Realm.

“This is it.”Qin Yu pointed at the empty space in front of him and said.

Li Yu grunted in gratitude. He raised his palm and slightly closed his eyes. His palm continuously stroked the air in front of him.

A few minutes later, a ray of light flashed on his palm.

The light was a little weak, but it was extremely mysterious.

“How is it? Can you open it?”Qin Yu asked.

Li Yu put away his palm and said, “Yes, but it will take some time.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“How long?”Qin Yu asked.

Li Yu said in a deep voice, “I’m afraid it will take a week.”

“A week?”Qin Yu’s brows furrowed even more.

When Zheng Ke opened the mystic realm, it wouldn’t take more than half a day at most!

But this Li Yu opened his mouth and asked for a week! This couldn’t help but make people suspicious!
