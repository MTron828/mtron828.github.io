Chapter 829: Killed!

That sharp blade brought with it a soaring radiance as it headed straight for Qin Yu’s glabella!

At this moment, Qin Yu had no way to dodge and could only clench his fist to receive the blow!

“Boom!”

The instant the two collided, the surroundings were instantly stirred up!

As for Qin Yu’s figure, he was directly pushed back.

The bones of his hand were shattered, and traces of blood flowed out.

His internal organs seemed to have received a great impact at that moment, and blood kept pouring out of his mouth.

“He’s not dead?” Shen Yichun’s face was full of surprise.

Qin Yu was scared from the ground. He looked at his body, and white marks appeared on his body.

“Damn it...” Qin Yu couldn’t help but clench his teeth.

He took a deep breath and looked at the four tokens coldly.

The tokens followed Qin Yu like a shadow and enveloped him, making him unable to use his spiritual power.

“As long as I break these four tokens, I should be able to do it,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Thinking of this, he shouted angrily and immediately shot out before grabbing the token directly!

But what surprised Qin Yu was that his palm actually went through the token directly!

“Hahaha!”

Shen Yichun, who wasn’t far away, couldn’t help but laugh out loud when he saw this.

“Fool, this token has already transformed into a spirit body and exists in your body. If you want to break it, dream on!” Shen Yichun sneered repeatedly.

Qin Yu frowned tightly.

From the looks of it, this technique was somewhat similar to the previous moves of Han Palace.

“I understand,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly. He used the internal qi in his body with all his might in an attempt to break through this barrier!

“It’s useless,” Shen Yichun said with a cold smile.

“This token was passed down from the ancestors. Its technique isn’t something a junior like you can imagine.”

Qin Yu ignored Shen Yichun’s bullsh*t. Layers of sweat appeared on his forehead, and the veins on his arms bulged like dragons!

“Ah!!”

With Qin Yu’s furious roars, a faint layer of golden light appeared on his body!

Shen Yichun’s expression changed drastically!

“Could it be that he really wants to break through this token?!” Shen Yichun thought to himself.

He didn’t dare to waste any more time and immediately activated the broken saber in his hand!

“Ah!!!”

Qin Yu roared furiously. At this moment, his physical body was unleashed to the maximum. All the veins on his body bulged out and it was a shocking sight!

“Boom!”

Along with a loud sound, a golden light that soared to the sky erupted from Qin Yu’s body!

At this moment, spiritual power also surged out like a spring!

Qin Yu’s body emitted an intense killing intent and a terrifying internal qi spread out rapidly.

“If I didn’t have this Martial Saint’s power as my foundation, I’m afraid I wouldn’t be able to do anything about this token.” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Not far away, Shen Yichun’s expression was extremely ugly. He had never expected that this token would actually collapse!

“Go to hell!” Shen Yichun grabbed the broken blade in his hand and swung it at Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s body trembled as waves of peaceful Qi spread out from his body.

The moment this Qi appeared, Qin Yu’s body seemed to be plated with a layer of golden light! At the same time, Qin Yu’s internal qi was also coated with a layer of golden light!

This technique was the heaven-grade technique that Qin Yu had learned in the scripture depository, the vajra sacred physique!

With the support of the vajra sacred physique, Qin Yu’s body had reached another level.

Qin Yu clenched his fist, and with a posture that could crush a dead branch, he directly smashed forward!

“Boom!”

The power that could destroy the world exploded at this moment!

The killing intent from the broken blade was directly dispersed!

“Bang! Bang! Bang!!”

The power spread toward Shen Yichun and forced him back a few steps!

Shen Yichun felt that things were bad and turned around to leave.

However, Qin Yu wouldn’t give him the chance. He immediately took a step forward and blocked Shen Yichun’s way!

“I let you escape last time. This time, I won’t make the same mistake again,” Qin Yu said coldly.

After he finished speaking, Qin Yu clenched his fingers and directly locked this space!

Qin Yu didn’t have much control over spatial arts.

He relied on the tyrannical brute force brought by the power of a Martial Saint!

Shen Yichun’s expression turned cold and he said coldly, “What? Do you still want to kill me?”

Qin Yu didn’t answer his question, “Speaking of which, I haven’t tried the Golden Core of a half-step Martial Saint before...”

Shen Yichun’s brows suddenly tightened! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

This kid had actually set his sights on his Golden Core!

“I am a half-step Martial Saint, so how can you kill me just because you want to?!” Shen Yichun shouted.

“So what if you can recover your spiritual power? Today, I will fight you to the death!”

The great battle broke out at this moment!

As an elder of the Hong Yi Sect, Shen Yichun had countless spells under his control!

However, Qin Yu didn’t have any fancy moves. He only had a pair of iron fists that could break through ten thousand spells!

The sky rumbled continuously. In the blink of an eye, both sides had exchanged dozens of moves.

Qin Yu’s moves were wide. Relying on his fierce physical body and the vajra sacred physique technique, he went all out.

After several hundred moves, Shen Yichun’s internal qi began to gradually wither.

However, Qin Yu became more and more courageous as he fought. His fighting spirit was overflowing!

“If this continues, I will definitely die here!” Shen Yichun already had the intention to retreat.

He gritted his teeth and immediately held the broken blade in his hand. He slashed towards the surrounding space to find a way out for himself!

However, at this moment, Qin Yu took a step forward and used his physical body to block this attack!

The sharp blade landed on Qin Yu’s chest, leaving a deep gash.

Fresh blood flowed down his chest.

This made Shen Yichun’s heart skip a beat!

“Are... Are you crazy?!” A trace of fear flashed in Shen Yichun’s eyes!

In order to prevent himself from escaping, he actually used his physical body to block!

Qin Yu touched his chest and sneered. “You want to run? Since you’re here, you should stay!”

With that, Qin Yu charged at Shen Yichun again!

his desperate fighting style had completely frightened Shen Yichun, and hE became more and more flustered.

As a result, he revealed more and more flaws. Qin Yu’s fists kept smashing on his body!

“One punch can break ten thousand spells!”

Accompanied by Qin Yu’s angry roar, a monstrous killing intent condensed in Qin Yu’s palm!

At this moment, Shen Yichun felt an intense sense of danger!

He pulled out his broken blade and attempted to block it, but it was already too late!

This punch poured down on his ears and body without holding back!

“Boom!”

Shen Yichun’s body crashed fiercely into the ground!

His bones were almost shattered, but as a half-step Martial Saint, he was still extremely clear-headed.

“Qin Yu, I...”

Shen Yichun was about to speak, but Qin Yu had already walked over.

He stretched out his hand and grabbed Shen Yichun’s dantian!

This sharp pain immediately caused Shen Yichun to almost collapse!

He stretched out his hand to stop him, but Qin Yu grabbed his wrist!

Shen Yichun watched helplessly as Qin Yu forcefully dug out his Golden Core from his dantian!

The Golden Core in Qin Yu’s hand. This Golden Core was the size of half a palm!
