Chapter 2856: The Ancient God’s Fallen Land

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Although it could not resist the Power of the Ancients emitted by the Burial Heaven Cave, this eye could avoid the power to the greatest extent.

The power of the Holy Consciousness already had a huge advantage of accumulating over time.

The Eye of Destruction, Shimoji, could still obtain endless power from the Saint Kingdom. This was the strength of the Saint Supreme.

As the hundreds of layers of ghost fog intersected, the Eye of Destruction accurately landed on Qin Yu through the countless gaps in the refracted multicolored light.

This power is a great opportunity for him.

Lord Sui’s face was filled with fanaticism.

At this moment, the three tiny Absolute Beginning Life Stones in his palm moved slowly.

Although he had the Upper Dome, he had not dared to come personally before.

After all, this place was where a Holy Consciousness had fallen.

With the powerful assistance of the Eye of Destruction, he saw through the fog here.

He had also sneakily attacked a few groups of people here and obtained three Absolute Beginning Life Stones.

His eyes were burning, but he quickly shifted his gaze away from Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s performance just now still shocked him enough.

Compared to his strength, Lord Sui felt he might not be able to retreat unscathed if he were to fall into the same situation.

“I’ll let you live for a while more.”

The corners of his mouth curled into a cold smile.

Compared to all the living beings, he was the one who consumed the least energy here.

He could almost avoid 70% of the Power of the Ancients. What he needed to wait for now was time.

Once everyone fell into a bitter battle, he would make the final move.

He still had to take all the advantages before that.

He could become the oldest living being under the three Holy Consciousness in this world.

As the Eye of Destruction turned, its gaze had already wandered in another direction.

Under the gaze of these eyes, Lord Sui once again disappeared into the fog. When he appeared, he would take away lives.

Moreover, he could directly fuse with the supreme treasure here with the Eye of Destruction.

Therefore, he was different from the others.

His strength increased after entering the Burial Heaven Cave.

Such a harvest was extremely exaggerated to someone who had reached the Dao Consciousness Realm for a long time like Lord Sui.

After the accumulation process, his peak power also faintly increased a little.

This visible change was extremely shocking. The accumulation of the peak power was extremely slow.

Without the accumulation of time, no changes could be detected.

This was also the reason why the three Holy Consciousness of the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom were so terrifying.

Kill!

A fanatical flame slowly appeared in Lord Sui’s eyes. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

If he didn’t take it, he would regret it for the rest of his life.

In the Demon Sealing Valley, a round palm was resting.

The power of the calamity kept shuttling on the palm.

All of a sudden, the power of Seven Tribulations Sin seemed to have changed.

The power on the palm suddenly disappeared.

Wu Tian’s lips curled into a strange smile. Dazzling golden blood slowly seeped out from the corner of his mouth.

The Seven Tribulations Sin had lost its effect.

Buddha Wu Tian!

Pang De was shocked.

Although Wu Tian’s body was incomplete, he was almost the strongest in this world during his full victory.

That was why he was suppressed by many Saint Supremes. They even divided his corpse into five parts and suppressed him in different Saint Kingdoms.

At this moment, his move suffered a backlash.

Could an expert be behind Qin Yu, or some mighty figure reincarnated?

Otherwise, how could he escape the punishment of the Seven Tribulations Sin repeatedly? Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

It was impossible to predict his past, future, and current life. This person had died once in the land of war between Gods and Demons. His karma had completely disappeared, but someone had paid a huge price to send him back.

“He is an existence that cannot be determined. In addition, my strength is far from reaching my peak.”

It was reasonable that the Seven Tribulations Sin couldn’t achieve its effect.

It was just that the location of the Seven Tribulations Sin restart was actually inside the Burial Heaven Cave.

“The Power of the Ancients stopped my Seven Tribulations Sin.” Wu Tian looked pensive.

Pang De did not understand, but he did not interrupt Wu Tian’s thoughts.

“It’s called Buried Heaven. Do you know who is the power behind this place? I remember telling you this story a long time ago.”

Wu Tian looked at Pang De with a smile. The little boy had grown up unknowingly.

He looked at Pang De as if he was looking at his child. If his child could grow up, perhaps he would be as old as Pang De now.

However, the hypocrisy of the Faramita Buddhist Kingdom did not hesitate to make the little boy disappear to wake him up.

Wu Tian smiled mockingly. “You might not have expected this.”

He had never bothered to touch the supreme treasure in their eyes.

However, that little bit of karma would follow his will and would never dissipate.

It would continue until the entire Faramita Buddhist Kingdom was burned to ashes, no matter the price.

“Buddha Wu Tian, are you talking about Heaven End Hou, the one who wanted to destroy the Path of Heaven in the Divine Realm?”

The information about the Heaven End Hou was enough to shock people. It was one of the four ancient gods of the Divine Realm.

It was the descendant of Blood Devil Emperor and Qin Demon Emperor, the two monarch-level bloodlines.

When it was born, it was destined to be extraordinary.

However, this bloodline power actually made the Path of Heaven tremble.

When it was born, the entire Divine Realm revealed a strange phenomenon.

The power of the Path of Heaven was once strongly suppressed.

However, the Path of Heaven guided the human race during the race’s supreme period.

After the two Immortal Emperors gave birth to the Heaven End Hou, the four human race Immortal Emperors attacked together.

They killed the two emperor-level experts. Hence, its growth path was not complete.

In the following period, the Heaven End Hou grew in an unstoppable manner.

During the long years of war, there were countless human experts during the supreme era of the human race.

However, it was still at an absolute disadvantage in the battle with Heaven End Hou. Wherever it went, it would bring absolute destruction and death.

However, the will of the Path of Heaven descended when it finally broke through to the seventh stage of the tribulation and reached the throne.

At that time, the Dao Guardian had also appeared at the place where it had advanced. Then, four human Emperor-level experts tried to kill it.

During that war, the entire Divine Realm was almost destroyed by the Great Success.

Two of the four Emperor-level experts also died on the spot.

The remaining two were also heavily injured. Only then did they manage to kill one of the most powerful gods.

After its death, it was sent to the Burial Heaven Cave.

This was also the key cause and effect of the change in the human race’s supreme era. Then, the Great Dao changed and the era of history entered the next stage.

“This is just a matter on the surface, but a part of the history of the entire era.”
