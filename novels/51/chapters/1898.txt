1899 Sharing with Saintess Gu

Looking at the worried look on Saintess Gu’s face, Qin Yu couldn’t help but say, “They are all disciples of the nine great aristocratic families. Even if there is any danger, they must have a way to save their lives.”

Saintess Gu shook her head and said, “No, you don’t understand the nine great aristocratic families at all.”

Qin Yu was a little surprised and waited for her to continue.

“The purpose of this trip to the sanctum is to gain experience,” Saintess Gu explained. “If life-saving means are set up, this trip will be meaningless. It won’t bring any advancement.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu sneered in his heart.

However, Qin Yu did not believe what she said. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

These aristocratic families must have left a way out for them. They would not allow any untoward incident to happen to them.

“Alright, let them pray for their blessings,” Qin Yu urged and said.

In Qin Yu’s opinion, they had to find the hidden treasure before the others. Otherwise, they would not be able to get anything.

Two of them continued moving forward. Just as recorded in Qin Yu’s mind, the rest of the journey was smooth without any other obstacles.

In a short while, they arrived in front of a stone door.

This stone door was tremendously huge, as tall as several people. It was majestic and gave off a strong sense of oppression. It made the two of them a little breathless.

Qin Yu was silent. He tried to push open the huge stone door with all his strength.

A golden light flickered on his palm, and the powerful force pushed the huge stone door with a loud bang.

Dust was stirred up at this moment. Saintess Gu, who was not far away, could not help but cover her mouth and nose.

“The stone door is not opened this way,” Saintess Gu said at this moment.

Qin Yu turned to look at Saintess Gu, frowned, and said, “How do I open it then?”

Saintess Gu didn’t say a word. She walked to the stone door and stopped.

She put her palms together and mumbled something. It was as if she was outlining the Great Dao, and an extremely mysterious radiance appeared around her.

“Rumble…”

With a series of rumbles, the huge stone door slowly opened.

The moment the door opened, a trace of aged internal qi rushed out. The first thing that entered their eyes was an ancient stone cave.

On the wall, there were stone holes, which looked like cabinets built on stones.

As for the hidden treasure that they were looking for, it was naturally hidden in the cabinet.

Qin Yu and the Gu Saint didn’t dare to waste time, so they quickly walked in.

Qin Yu released his divine sense to cover the surroundings, trying to find something.

Unfortunately, there was nothing else apart from what they saw.

Qin Yu furrowed his brows and said softly, “It’s really an incomplete sanctum…”

This trip would not have been so smooth if it were a complete sanctum.

The sanctum of a Tribulation Stage great cultivator was enough to give birth to incredibly frightening creatures. Even if he had died, he would probably leave behind a remnant of his divine sense or obsession.

Unfortunately, there was nothing here. It was more like a storage room.

“Alright, time to split the loot,” Qin Yu muttered.

Saintess Gu glanced at Qin Yu but didn’t speak.

She reached out her palm, and the treasures floated into the air.

It was unknown how many years these treasures had remained silent. They no longer looked lustrous and were even covered in dust.

Even so, Qin Yu could tell that these treasures were extraordinary.

He activated his desolate divine eye and scanned through every single treasure.

Soon, Qin Yu’s eyes fell on a Divine Stone.

The Divine Stone looked dull and did not have any internal qi fluctuations, but the origin of this Divine Stone was incredibly extraordinary!

“If I’m not mistaken, this should be a Bodhi gem…” Qin Yu murmured.

There were many rumors about the Bodhi gem. Romor had it that the Bodhi gem conceived the seed of Bodhi. When the seed was planted, it would give birth to the Bodhi treasure tree.

The origins of the Bodhi treasure tree were even more terrifying. Rumor had it that numerous top existences had enlightened and ascended under the Bodhi treasure tree. The most famous one was Shakyamuni.

This kind of treasure tree was tremendously precious. Rumor had it that it grew in a terrifying Forbidden Zone. Back then, an Immortal Emperor brought out a few treasure trees from there. Since then, the Bodhi gem was born and scattered all over the world.

Qin Yu suppressed his excitement and looked at Saintess Gu subconsciously.

Saintess Gu’s eyes fell on the Bodhi gem as well.

Qin Yu had a bad feeling in her heart.

It seemed that Saintess Gu had also noticed the extraordinary qualities of this gem.

“Saintess Gu, there are many treasures here. Can I only take one of them?” Qin Yu took the initiative to ask.

Saintess Gu covered her mouth and chuckled. She squinted her eyes and said, “You’re talking about the Bodhi gem, right?”

Qin Yu’s face changed slightly, and he suddenly had a bad feeling.

At this moment, Saintess Gu’s transcendent internal qi had disappeared. Instead, she looked like an old witch who was scheming.

This Saintess Gu was definitely not as simple as she looked!

“That’s right.” After hesitating for a while, Qin Yu finally nodded.

Since she had seen through him, there was no point hiding it.

...

“I didn’t expect you to know about the origin of this Bodhi gem,” Saintess Gu said with a smile.

Qin Yu remained silent. If Saintess Gu disagreed, he would have to give up today.

If they fought here, it would be hard to say who would win.

And without the help of Saintess Gu, Yan Yunfan and Si Shifeng would probably not let him go.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu gritted her teeth and said, “Since Saintess Gu is also interested in the Bodhi gem, I won’t fight with you.”

Upon hearing this, Saintess Gu’s beautiful eyes flashed with surprise.

She looked at Qin Yu, snickered, and said, “What? Are you giving up just like this?”

Qin Yu spread his hands and said, “What else can I do? Do I fight you here? I don’t think there’s a need for that.”

The smile on Saintess Gu’s face grew wider. She then reached out her hand and grabbed the Bodhi gem.

The other treasures were divided into two portions by Saintess Gu’s divine power. One portion fell into Qin Yu’s hand and the other portion into the hands of Saintess Gu.

This immediately made Qin Yu extremely displeased. D*mn it! This woman was really greedy. Not only did she take the Bodhi gem, but she also wanted to split the rest of the things equally!

...

“Don’t worry,” Saintess Gu said.

She looked at Qin Yu and said with a faint smile, “Since we’re here with our joint efforts, we’ll share the Bodhi gem. How about it?”

“You and I share it?” Qin Yu was stunned. His face was full of confusion.

“That’s right,” Saintess Gu smiled and said. “Is Mr. Qin unwilling?
