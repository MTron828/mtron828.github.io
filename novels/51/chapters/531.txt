Chapter 532: Kill Them Without Mercy! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The loud sound instantly attracted countless gazes!

They all felt confusion towards this unfamiliar face.

“Qin Yu!”

Han Meng immediately shouted, and a billowing air wave approached!

This voice contained powerful inner strength, and it was approaching Qin Yu’s vital point!

Qin Yu raised his palm, and this air wave turned into ashes.

“Han Wei, we finally meet,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Han Wei narrowed his eyes. Just as he was about to speak, Han Meng waved his hand and said, “There’s no need to be anxious. We are an aristocratic family. We have to maintain our poise.”

Han Wei nodded. He glanced at Qin Yu coldly and didn’t say anything.

“He is Qin Yu?”

“It is said that he has been challenging Young Master Han for many days, and it seems that he even killed Old Mister Yan.”

“It seems that the two of them are going to fight today. Qin Yu is obviously here to cause trouble.”

“Qin Yu looks so ordinary, yet he actually dares to challenge the Yan and Han families.”

“I heard that it’s because of the Yan family’s daughter.”

Everyone discussed animatedly with curious looks on their faces.

“Qin Yu, today is Young Master Han and Miss Yan’s big day. Where are the gifts you brought?” The person in charge of reception said indifferently.

Qin Yu glanced at him. He stretched out his hand and a coffin fell out of the Spatial Magic Artifact!

“This is a gift I will give Han Wei,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

A coffin on his big day?

How arrogant !

“Interesting.” Han Meng couldn’t help but sneer.

The person in charge of receiving the guests shouted, “A coffin? Quickly take the coffin and get out!”

Qin Yu laughed coldly. “Your master hasn’t said anything, yet you, a lap dog, are clamoring.”

After saying that, Qin Yu waved his hand and slapped the body of the person in charge.

The person in charge immediately flew into the air. Qin Yu gently raised his palm and the coffin lid opened.

The receptionist landed in the coffin without any deviation.

“Qin Yu!” Han Wei couldn’t hold it in any longer!

He clenched his fist and said coldly, “I think you’re courting death!”

Qin Yu sneered. “Han Wei, do you still remember our agreement?”

“If I win, you will obediently give up on Ruoxue. You didn’t forget, right?”

As soon as he said this, everyone was shocked.

Most of these people were businessmen. They had no idea that Qin Yu and Han Wei had such an agreement!

Han Meng didn’t deliberately hide it. He sneered and said, “Of course I remember, but... you bet with your life!”

“The same goes for you!” Qin Yu took a step forward and instantly arrived at the empty space in the middle!

“I’ve been waiting for this day for a long time,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Just as Han Wei was about to make a move, Han Meng waved his hand.

Then, Han Meng stood up and said, “Everyone, this is my son’s special performance for everyone. It’s to cheer everyone up.”

“Qin Yu has been harassing Miss Yan for many years. My son has endured it again and again, but he kept getting more and more outrageous.”

“So, on the day of the wedding, my son decided to solve the problem once and for all.”

Hearing Han Meng’s words, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer. “What a load of nonsense. Quit distorting the truth!”

Han Meng wasn’t angry. After all, among the people present, who would believe in Qin Yu’s words?

“Old Mister Yan, go find a place to sit first,” said Qin Yu.

Old Mister Yan nodded and said in a deep voice, “Be careful.”

“Don’t worry,” said Qin Yu.

Then, Qin Yu looked at Han Wei.

His internal qi was fluctuating and rapidly rising.

“Han Wei, why aren’t you making a move yet?” Qin Yu shouted.

Han Wei smiled and said, “Don’t worry. I have an appointment with the reporters, but they haven’t come yet.”

“I want to defeat you personally in front of everyone. You won’t have any objections, right?”

“Okay!” Qin Yu shouted.

“I also want the world to know that the Young Master of an aristocratic family can also lose to an ordinary person like me!”

Han Wei couldn’t help but laugh out loud. “How arrogant! You really think too highly of yourself!”

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered with Han Wei. He turned his gaze towards Yan Sihai and said coldly, “Yan Sihai, where’s Ruoxue?”

Yan Sihai said indifferently, “You don’t have the right to know.”

Qin Yu’s expression was cold as he said, “Yan Sihai, I’m telling you, no matter what, I will take Ruoxue away today.”

“If anyone tries to stop me... I’ll kill them without mercy!”

His eyes swept over everyone present! It was as if he was warning everyone present!
