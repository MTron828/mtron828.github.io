Chapter 1481: Chapter 1,481. The mission is to kill you! 1

The loud voice immediately attracted the attention of countless people.

For a moment, everyone turned their heads to look.

They saw the white-clothed Daoist walking over with a cold expression.

His eyes quickly landed on Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, I really didn’t expect you to actually come here,”the white-clothed Daoist said indifferently.

“Who are you to call Master Qin Like That? !”Someone suddenly shouted.

The white-robed Daoist narrowed his eyes. He raised his finger and pointed forward. A beam of light instantly shot out and directly shattered his head!

Seeing this scene, everyone’s faces turned ugly.

Qin Yu said with a cold face, “Dog, this matter has nothing to do with them, right?”

The white-clothed Daoist said with a faint smile, “It doesn’t have anything to do with them, but he offended me, so he deserves to die.”

“You’re so overbearing,”Qin Yu said with a dark face.

The white-clothed Daoist laughed loudly and said, “So what? Qin Yu, you’re about to die. Don’t you know?”

Qin Yu’s eyes couldn’t help but sweep around.

He saw that the surroundings of this medicine sacred hall had already been covered with a faint radiance.

Qin Yu immediately understood that this time, it wasn’t just the white-robed Daoist alone.

“Could it be the eighteen gods?”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He immediately released his divine sense and covered the entire medicine sacred hall.

As expected, the eighteen gods were waiting outside.

Qin Yu secretly felt that things weren’t good. Qin Yu had experienced the abilities of the eighteen gods. He was definitely not their match.

“First elder really went to great lengths to capture me,”Qin Yu said coldly.

The white-robed Daoist laughed loudly and said, “No, you’re wrong. I’m not going to capture you, but... kill you!”

A trace of solemnity flashed across Qin Yu’s face. He slightly closed his eyes and quickly thought of an escape plan.

“Damn it. If I had more time to step into the mighty realm, I would definitely not be afraid of them!”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Unfortunately, not everything could be done according to his thoughts.

“Looks like... This is the only way.”At this moment, a hint of coldness flashed across Qin Yu’s face.

In the next second, he directly activated the line word formula and appeared in front of the white-robed Daoist in almost an instant!

The white-robed Daoist was stunned. He had never expected Qin Yu to suddenly make a move!

“Little Bastard, you dare to steal...”

“Swish!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Before the white-robed Daoist could finish speaking, Qin Yu’s palm had already pressed against the white-robed Daoist’s forehead.

“As long as I exert force, I will be able to destroy your divine sense,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“Therefore, I advise you to be more obedient.”

The white-robed Daoist’s expression instantly turned extremely ugly. He had never thought that he would actually be captured alive by Qin Yu!

“Kid, do you think that I’m afraid of you just because of this!”The white-robed Daoist shouted loudly.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “You can try your divine ability. I guarantee that before this, your head will turn into a rotten watermelon.”

The white-robed Daoist’s body tensed up. He did not doubt the authenticity of these words in the slightest.

With Qin Yu’s personality, he would definitely do it!

The white-robed Daoist said in a deep voice, “Qin Yu, you better not act recklessly. I’m telling you, the eighteen gods will not let you off.”

“Cut the crap!”Qin Yu coldly berated, “Follow Me!”

The white-robed Daoist was already in Qin Yu’s hands, so he naturally didn’t dare to say anything. He could only obediently follow Qin Yu and walk out.

After walking out of the door, Qin Yu quickly discovered the alchemy king in the corridor.

Their eyes met, and the alchemy King’s expression changed slightly. Then, he hurriedly walked forward and said with a hypocritical expression, “Qin Yu, what... What’s going on? What Happened?”

Qin Yu sneered, “You know what happened. Alchemy King, it seems that you don’t take my words to heart.”

The Alchemy King’s expression instantly changed drastically, and he secretly cursed in his heart.

“Don’t worry, I won’t die today.”Qin Yu sneered.

This made the already anxious Alchemy King’s heart thump.

If Qin Yu didn’t die, then the one who would die in the future would definitely be him!

But the pill refining king in front of him couldn’t do anything at all. He didn’t even dare to admit it.

If he admitted it, he was afraid that he would be scolded by the people of the Medicine Sacred Hall in the future!

“Qin Yu, you’ve really misunderstood. I... I don’t know anything!”The pill refining king braced himself and said.

Qin Yu was too lazy to talk nonsense with him. He grabbed the white-clothed Daoist and continued to walk downstairs.

“Alchemy King, what does Qin Yu Mean? Could it really have something to do with you?”Su Song asked with a frown.

The Alchemy King’s old face darkened as he berated, “Of course it has nothing to do with me! This is clearly a misunderstanding. Can’t you see it?”

Although Su Song didn’t believe it, he had no evidence and could only give up.

The Alchemy King looked at Qin Yu’s back as his expression turned even colder.

But soon, he laughed again.

With the eighteen gods around, what was there to worry about? That was the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s great killing weapon. Who knew how many people it had killed back then!

Even if Qin Yu had great abilities, it was absolutely impossible for him to escape from the hands of the eighteen gods!

“Qin Yu, you’re dead meat!”The Alchemy King couldn’t help but sneer.

...

Qin Yu hooked one hand around the white-clothed Daoist’s neck, and the other hand touched the white-clothed Daoist’s forehead.

As long as he had any ill intentions, he would definitely be killed by Qin Yu in an instant.

“Qin Yu, let me tell you, if the eighteen gods don’t fall for your tricks, you... You Can’t kill me,”said the white-robed Daoist shamelessly.

“Shut up!”Qin Yu could not help but berate him.

The white-robed Daoist’s expression was somewhat unsightly, and he felt increasingly uneasy.

If the eighteen gods did not fall for this trick and Qin Yu directly killed him, then it would be troublesome.

The white-robed Daoist had thought of countless methods in his mind. The most reliable method was to abandon his physical body.

But that also meant that his lifetime cultivation would probably be destroyed!

It would take countless years to reconstruct another physical body!

The further down he went, the more uneasy the white-robed Daoist felt.

He couldn’t help but regret. Why did he say so much just now to give Qin Yu a chance?

“God bless...”the white-robed Daoist muttered in his heart.

Soon, Qin Yu led the white-robed Daoist out of the medicine Saint Hall.

Outside the medicine Saint Hall, the eighteen gods were standing high in the sky, looking at Qin Yu coldly.

The Moment Qin Yu appeared, a powerful killing intent approached!

This killing intent came from the eighteen gods!

They were like merciless killing machines that did not reveal the slightest emotion. There was only cold killing intent all over their bodies!

Qin Yu looked coldly at the eighteen gods and berated, “The white-robed Daoist is in my hands. I warn you to not act recklessly.”

The moment these words were said, Qin Yu and the white-robed Daoist became nervous.

The authority to kill was in the hands of the eighteen celestials!

“Kill if you want to. The order we received was to kill you.”

After a while, the eighteen celestials finally spoke.

As soon as these words were said, the expressions of Qin Yu and the white-robed Daoist became extremely ugly!
