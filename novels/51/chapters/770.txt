“We have already taken enough measures.” There was a hint of mockery in the tone of the higher-ups.

“Xia Hang, what do you think?” At this moment, someone suddenly asked.

An unnatural look flashed across Xia Hang’s face.

“With my current skills, I’m definitely not a match for Qin Yu. Moreover... Granny Qin is the True Controller of power. I can’t do anything either.” Xia Hang took advantage of the situation and said.

“How about... the higher-ups make a move personally?” Xia Hang suddenly suggested.

As soon as these words were said, the scene instantly fell into silence.

No one was willing to take up this topic.

And Xia Hang seemed to have guessed something from their attitude.

“En? What’s that picture in Qin Yu’s hand?” At this time, someone noticed the picture Qin Yu was controlling on the screen.

“What kind of treasure is that? It actually dissolved the power of a Martial Saint so easily?”

“What are those two corpses?”

For a moment, the higher-ups were all attracted by the contents of the video.

After they finished watching the entire video, they fell into silence once again.

“That little girl... seems to be somewhat similar to a certain character recorded in the ancient books.” A higher-up seemed to have guessed something.

“Xia Hang, send someone to capture her immediately!” A higher-up quickly gave an order.

Xia Hang said awkwardly, “With my strength, it’s impossible for me to be a match for Qin Yu...”

The higher-ups were silent for a moment.

They could clearly bestow power to Xia Hang, but in the end, they decided to wait for Granny Qin.

It was very obvious that these higher-ups didn’t believe Xia Hang.

“Let Qin Yu live for a few more days,” the higher-ups said coldly.

“Xia Hang, you have to keep a close eye on Qin Yu.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

After saying this, the higher-ups began to slowly disappear.

After walking out of the meeting room, Xia Hang took out a cigarette from his pocket and put it in his mouth.

A cold smile appeared on his face.

“I seem to have guessed something,” Xia Hang said with a cold smile.

...

Granny Qin was in a coma, and Qin Yu also had a chance to catch his breath.

These few days, Qin Yu had been racking his brains, but he couldn’t think of a way to deal with the power of the Martial Saint.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s phone suddenly rang.

He picked up the phone and saw that the caller was the Pavilion Master.

Qin Yu hurriedly picked up the phone and said, “Pavilion Master, why did you suddenly call me?”

The Pavilion Master said indifferently, “Qin Yu, haven’t you forgotten a lot of things?”

Qin Yu was stunned. He scratched his head and said, “Pavilion Master, what do you mean by this?”

The Pavilion Master said indifferently, “I remember that I said that I would take you to use the warehouse, but you have to agree to one condition of mine, right?”

Qin Yu patted his head and hurriedly said, “Pavilion Master, I haven’t forgotten. If there’s anything you need me to do, just let me know!”

The Pavilion Master continued, “You also promised Ye Qing that you would give them the pill formula.”

“Ah, right, right, right. I’ve been too busy recently, I forgot...” Qin Yu was a little embarrassed.

The Pavilion Master on the other end said, “Come to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. Jiang He is here too.”

After saying that, the Pavilion Master hung up the phone.

Qin Yu quickly stood up and muttered, “Damn, I actually forgot about this.”

The man with the mustache muttered, “What’s wrong?”

Qin Yu said, “I’m going to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

“I’ll go with you!” The man with the mustache quickly stood up and said.

“The Divine Alchemist Pavilion is a good place. According to my geographical speculation, it used to be a graveyard...” the man with the mustache licked his lips and said.

Qin Yu glared at the man with the mustache and said, “You’d better not have any ideas about the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

The man with the mustache smiled embarrassedly and said, “Don’t worry, I won’t do anything reckless.”

Just as Qin Yu was about to set off, his phone rang again.

He picked up the phone and saw that the caller was actually Xia Hang.

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

He walked to the side and picked up the phone.

“What’s wrong?” Qin Yu asked in a deep voice.

Xia Hang said, “Let’s meet tonight. I have something to tell you.”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, and then he agreed, “Okay, where shall we meet?”

“I’ll send you the address later.”

After saying that, Xia Hang hung up the phone.

Qin Yu grabbed his phone, and he couldn’t help but frown slightly.

“Things have really come together,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

After thinking for a while, Qin Yu sent a message to the Pavilion Master: I have something to do tonight, I’ll arrive at the Divine Alchemist Pavilion on time tomorrow.

Not long after, the Pavilion Master replied: Okay.

At this moment.

In a certain mansion in Jingdu.

A muscular man was sipping tea.

This man’s internal qi was unparalleled. Every movement of his had a powerful internal qi.

Most importantly, this man was wearing a purple-robed man.

This man was a purple-robed man of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. His position wasn’t low and his name was Chen Huang.

As a purple-robed man, Chen Huang didn’t report to Xia Hang or Qu Xie. Instead, he directly reported to the higher-ups and Granny Qin.

As for Xia Hang, Chen Huang had always been worried. After all, Xia Hang’s previous position was to build a good relationship with the various aristocratic families.

This kind of person who went deep into the secular world didn’t have fixed loyalties and was easily bewitched by benefits.

Apart from that, Chen Huang also had his own selfish motives.

He coveted the position of President!

Although this position wouldn’t be higher than the position of the purple-robed men, it had more resources and honor!

As long as he caught Xia Hang’s dirty secret, he could replace him!

Therefore, Chen Huang secretly sent a purple-robed man to secretly monitor Xia Hang.

That evening.

Chen Huang’s phone rang.

“Brother Chen, Xia Hang went out.” A voice came from the other end.

“Where did he go?” Chen Huang asked.

The other end said, “Qinggang Mountain.”

Chen Huang’s expression froze.

Qinggang Mountain? The place where Qin Yu and Blackie fought?

“Before he left, Xia Hang made a call,” the other end continued.

Chen Huang narrowed his eyes and said, “Keep an eye on him! No matter what news there is, inform me immediately!”

“Yes.” The call was cut off.

...

At this moment, Qin Yu was rushing towards Qinggang Mountain.

Meanwhile, Xia Hang had been waiting at Qinggang Mountain for a long time.

The surroundings were in ruins. Ever since that battle, Qinggang Mountain, which was already deserted, was even more deserted.

The sky gradually darkened. At around 8 o’clock in the evening, Qin Yu finally appeared at Qinggang Mountain.

Xia Hang waved his hand at Qin Yu and said, “Here.”

Qin Yu grunted and immediately strode toward Xia Hang.

At this moment, the purple-robed man hiding in the dark suddenly narrowed his eyes!

“Qin Yu?” He muttered in a low voice and then sneered. “Xia Hang, you actually dared to secretly contact Qin Yu. You’re dead meat!”

After saying that, the purple-robed man took out his phone and pressed the camera button to film Xia Hang.
