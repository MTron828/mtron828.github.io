Chapter 1576: Chapter 1,576, the defeated elder Bai Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

If Qin Yu interfered to resolve this matter, the next acting sect master might very well become Di Zun!

“Qin Yu, you’d better not spoil my plans,”elder Bai said coldly.

...

The next day.

Qin Yu walked out of the pharmacy with a few pills in his hands.

Then, Qin Yu walked into the hall with the pill in his hands.

In the hall, the deputy sect master and many elders were already waiting.

At this moment, the deputy sect master looked like he couldn’t hold on for long.

With a closer look, one could even see traces of death.

Qin Yu walked into the room quickly. When he saw Qin Yu, many elders greeted him, and Qin Yu responded to them one by one.

“Master.”Di Zun walked quickly to Qin Yu.

Elder Bai said with a strange tone, “Tsk Tsk, Di Zun, shouldn’t your master be the first elder? Why do you call him Master?”

Di Zun frowned slightly. This time, before Qin Yu could speak, he scolded, “Elder Bai, you’d better not stir up trouble.”

......

Elder Bai was stunned and immediately said angrily, “Di Zun! I am an elder of the Heavenly Cloud sect. How dare you talk to me like that? !”

Di zun sneered and said, “Elder Bai, who doesn’t know that you are someone who relies on flattery to get to where you are? Do you think that you are worthy of the position of an elder?”

“What... What did you say? !”Elder Bai was furious. He walked to Di Zun in two or three steps.

Di Zun looked at elder Bai coldly and said, “Why? Do you want to fight with me? Alright, I will wait for you in the Martial Hall. Do You Dare?”

Elder Bai opened his mouth and was speechless for a moment.

His strength was the weakest among the elders, and he was no match for Di Zun at all.

“If you don’t dare, then shut your mouth,”Di Zun snorted coldly.

Seeing that he couldn’t win against Di Zun, elder Bai simply shifted his conflict onto everyone.

“Did you all see that? This Di Zun doesn’t know the etiquette of respect and doesn’t even put our elders in his eyes. Can such a person still stay in the Tianyun Sect?”Elder Bai shouted at the surrounding elders.

However, the surrounding elders mocked, “Elder Bai, what you said isn’t right, right? Di Zun doesn’t seem to put you in his eyes. He’s still quite polite to us.”

“That’s right. Moreover, what Di Zun said doesn’t seem to be a problem.”

“Elder Bai, I’m afraid you’re thinking too much. Di Zun is now the number one disciple of the heavenly cloud sect. His talent is hard to come by in a thousand years. Even if we expel you from the Heavenly Cloud Sect, we won’t be able to expel Di Zun.”

Hearing everyone’s words, elder Bai’s face turned red, but he couldn’t find any expression to refute them.

Qin Yu tried hard to hold back his laughter. He glanced at elder Bai and said, “Alright, stop talking nonsense. Trash, you’d better go to the side and stay there obediently. Don’t look for a sense of existence.”

“Good, good. You guys don’t respect me so much. I...”

“How are you?”Di Zun raised his eyebrows and said sarcastically.

Elder Bai opened his mouth but couldn’t utter a word for a long time.

“Alright, stop wasting time.”Qin Yu was too lazy to talk nonsense with elder Bai.

He took out the pill and walked toward the deputy sect leader.

“Wait!”

At this time, elder Bai shouted loudly. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “I don’t believe you. Who knows whether the pill in your hand is poisonous or not?”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “Are you done?”

Elder Bai snorted coldly and said, “I have already discussed with everyone. Let My Alchemist treat the deputy sect leader first.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu subconsciously looked at the other people around him.

“Mr. Qin, just agree with him. Otherwise, he won’t be convinced,”an elder said in a low voice.

Seeing this, Qin Yu didn’t say anything else.

He glanced at the vice sect master and said, “I can tell you that the vice sect master’s physical condition can not be delayed.”

As he was speaking, a disciple suddenly came to report.

“Elder Bai, there’s someone outside who claims to be an alchemist who wants to see you,”said the disciple.

Elder Bai was immediately overjoyed and hurriedly said, “He’s Here! Quickly invite him in!”

Not long after, an old man walked in from outside.

This Old Man’s face was full of arrogance. Although his strength was not that great, his posture was very good. He looked like a reclusive master.

“You’re here.”Elder Bai walked up eagerly.

The old man nodded slightly, and then asked indifferently, “What’s the situation?”

Elder bai sighed and said, “Sigh, our vice sect master is seriously injured. All the alchemists in the entire South Province have come to see him, but they are all helpless.”

When the old man heard this, he said with some pride, “The alchemists in the South Province are just a bunch of trash.”

“You’re right, you’re right!”Elder Bai nodded repeatedly.

Then, the old man walked toward the vice sect master.

He raised his palm and placed it on the vice sect master’s forehead.

After a moment, the old man said indifferently, “It’s a small problem. Give me a few hours to refine a pill. I can make the vice sect master lively!”

“As expected of a Master!”Elder Bai was overjoyed and couldn’t help but give him a thumbs up.

Qin Yu was also intimidated by the old man. For a moment, he didn’t know whether he really had some skill or was just posturing.

“Master, What Pill do you plan to refine for the deputy sect master?”Qin Yu blocked the old man’s way.

The old man glanced at Qin Yu and berated, “Do I need to tell you what pill I want to refine? !”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “If the Pill You’re refining can’t cure the deputy sect leader, who will be in charge then?”

“Qin Yu, what do you mean? !”Elder Bai shouted at the side.

Qin Yu ignored elder Bai and continued, “You’d better tell me the name of the pill.”

The old man saw that Qin Yu was so stubborn, so he snorted and said, “There’s no harm in telling you. The deputy sect leader’s meridians are all broken, and his vital gate is damaged. I only need to refine an invisible blood clotting pill for him.”

“Invisible blood clotting pill?”Hearing this, Qin Yu’s face instantly darkened. He was even more certain that this old man was a liar.

“What?”The old man glanced at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu said with a dark face, “Invisible blood clotting pill is only used to temporarily alleviate the injury, but if you don’t get the follow-up treatment, the injury will instantly erupt, and you might even lose your life.”

“Old Thing, do you really not understand, or are you planning to scam money?”Qin Yu said with a dark face.

Hearing this, the old man immediately flew into a rage, “Who the hell are you to dare question me? !”

Qin Yu said indifferently, “My name is Qin Yu. Unfortunately, I am also an alchemist.”

After saying this, Qin Yu extended his palm, and a purple-colored spiritual fire immediately appeared.

Seeing this flame, the old man’s expression became somewhat unnatural.

“Do you want to leave by yourself, or do you want me to send you away?”Qin Yu asked coldly.
