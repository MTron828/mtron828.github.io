Chapter 2658: Life and Death Test

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu gasped. One had to know that this was a sect that had existed within the Saint Kingdom for so long.

The rewards of this once-in-fifty-years Dao Competition were already shockingly bountiful, not to mention that there was another layer of meaning behind it.

“May I ask? Why is Elder Xin Yue telling me so much?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but inquire.

“Among the outsiders, your strength isn’t the strongest. There’s already someone here who has completely reached the True Consciousness Realm.

Moreover, the cultivation method he practices has some connections with our Daoist teachings,” Elder Xin Yue explained, producing a gourd from which a drop of water flowed.

A water mirror slowly formed in the air, revealing a figure amidst the ripples.

“Hua Tian!”

Qin Yu’s expression shifted as he observed Hua Tian, who was currently wreaking havoc in the Ancient Demon Land. His expression grew solemn. “So powerful. I didn’t expect this individual to also venture into this place.” “Do you know him?” Jing Xin asked curiously.

“We’ve had some conflicts. It seems he cultivates the Way of Cosmic Luck, allowing him to perceive powers that elude our detection,” Qin Yu replied, nodding.

With Hua Tian’s strength, he was undoubtedly beneath Qin Yu before entering this Saint Kingdom.

However, it was unexpected that Hua Tian had obtained the Dao Mystical Saint’s divine flame rune and now surpassed him completely.

“His appearance here must mean he’s perceived some advantageous powers. Otherwise, he wouldn’t appear so boldly,” Qin Yu remarked with a slight furrow of his brow.

He had faced off against Hua Tian several times, the most recent encounter nearly resulting in his demise.

At the brink of death and severe injury, Hua Tian’s sneak attack nearly made him taste defeat. Afterward, he never sensed the presence of this person again.

“Indeed, I suspect he’s the chosen candidate of our Valley Master Dan. I’ll take this opportunity to observe him closely. Furthermore, I sense a formidable power within him, one that even I fear,” Elder Xin Yue added with a frown.

Qin Yu remained composed outwardly, but internally, a storm brewed. If even

Elder Xin Yue feared Hua Tian’s power, how could Qin Yu hope to withstand it?

“You asked earlier why I selected you. It’s related to my cultivation method. Man mimics the earth, the earth mimics the heavens, and the heavens mimic the Dao. The inner force I cultivate follows the Dao of Nature. While it lacks offensive capabilities, it sharpens my perception greatly, rivaling even the Valley Master’s,” Elder Xin Yue explained softly.

“I dislike the internal qi emanating from him, but your internal qi is particularly compatible with my cultivation technique,” Elder Xin Yue continued, channeling her power to envelop Qin Yu with her aura.

Qin Yu felt no discomfort as her internal permeated his body.

“Rest assured, this power holds no offensive capabilities,” Elder Xin Yue reassured him with a smile, noticing his nervousness.

Qin Yu was taken aback. It was the first time he had encountered such a remarkable cultivation method.

This internal qi seemed to possess its consciousness, resonating with the power within his body. The two forces played together like children.

In a short period, Qin Yu felt his divine soul lighten, no longer burdened by the previous sense of obscurity and discomfort.

“Could it be that the Seal of Heaven Returning within my body is what makes Xin Yue’s cultivation technique feel so compatible?”

Qin Yu pondered silently. The Demon Sealing Valley emerged because of Chen

Shuang, so their cultivation methods inevitably involved Chen Shuang’s power,

Since his Seal of Heaven Returning was also derived from Chen Shuang’s power, it made sense for it to evoke such affinity.

“This is a significant change, and this Dao Competition will be far bloodier than before. If one can’t even pass this stage, they won’t be qualified to vie for the position of Holy Lord. All disciples of the Demon Sealing Valley, except the elders, can participate in the Dao Competition, regardless of the risks. Although your power aligns with mine, the strength you demonstrated was too feeble, whether for outsiders or disciples of the Demon Sealing Valley,” Xin Yue shook her head slightly, sighing imperceptibly.

If Qin Yu could fully grasp the Way of Rules, he might have a chance to reach the True Consciousness Realm. However, his current strength was inadequate.

Despite the formidable power of the Order of the Saint Kingdom he comprehended, Qin Yu seemed unable to fully control it, as demonstrated by his previous attack.

This Order of the Saint Kingdom inflicted mutual harm upon both sides. While it could repel adversaries, it would also harm the user.

In severe cases, Qin Yu might even suffer the backlash of this Order, becoming a complete puppet.

Qin Yu fell silent. Indeed, compared to Monk Hua Tian, his strength still fell short.

However, he had his methods. Elder Xin Yue had said so much to him, and he was afraid that there would be more to come. He just needed to listen quietly.

“In this Demon Sealing Valley, everything requires a significant amount of Dao points to be exchanged. Some of these things can greatly enhance your strength. Dao points are the merit points accumulated when we carry out sect missions. They are extremely difficult to obtain.”

Elder Xin Yue spoke slowly.

“Including you, I will give some people a test. If you can earn my approval, then I will provide you with my greatest assistance. However, there is a high possibility that you will perish in this trial.’

Xin Yue said with a smile.

“Engage in a life-and-death duel with my clone. If you can endure for fifteen minutes, I will consider it as you passing my test.”

“Master.”

Jing Xin couldn’t help but ask.

“That’s Master’s battle clone. Master’s dao technique has naturally condensed her battle consciousness to the point where it’s almost invisible, sealing it within her avatar. Once the battle clone is activated, it will be a lethal confrontation. Unless Master retrieves her clone, you won’t be able to escape.

Under the divine might of the True Consciousness, you will undoubtedly be defeated.”

“Accept? Or perhaps we can just treat today’s meeting as a dream.”

Xin Yue softly said.

“I accept. Bring it on.”

Qin Yu agreed without hesitation. The battle with Hua Tian was inevitable.

His cultivation technique was very peculiar. Although he didn’t know if he could cultivate here, judging from his performance just now, it seemed that he was still a cultivator.

He should continue to inherit the previous cultivation technique, and it appeared that he had made further progress.

With his cosmic luck-locking technique, there was no way he could evade it.

Moreover, before he entered this place, he had also obtained the Heart of Saint Kingdom bestowed by Chen Shuang.

If he couldn’t even accept this trial, Qin Yu would never be able to overcome the barrier in his heart. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Let me remind you that I have given this trial to many outsiders before, but very few of them survived my battle clone. I will ask again, do you want to accept this trial?”

As Xin Yue spoke, a hint of blood started to fill her eyes..
