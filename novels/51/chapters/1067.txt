Chapter 1068: Chapter 1,068, confronting the higher-ups! 

The scene that happened in midair made everyone feel incredulous.

They had not expected that this battle would actually involve the true higher-ups of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!

Everyone knew of the existence of the higher-ups, but no one understood them, much less knew their true appearances!

Now, this higher-up actually appeared before everyone’s eyes!

Although he had borrowed someone else’s body, just this strand of divine sense was enough to shock the world!

Qin Yu’s face revealed a trace of solemnity.

The strength of the higher-ups was unfathomable. They were at least at the Almighty Realm.

This was the difference of a major realm. It was too difficult to cross it.

“Swoosh!”

At this moment, the immortal crane also flew over from not far away.

He stood beside Qin Yu and said quietly, “Count me in.”

Qin Yu glanced at immortal crane and shook his head. “There’s no need. I’ll deal with him myself.”

Immortal crane frowned and said, “Now is not the time to show off.”

Qin Yu wiped the blood off his face and said with a sneer, “I’m not showing off. I just want to know how big the gap is between me and a mighty figure.”

“And... This is just a strand of his divine sense, not his actual body. I might not lose to him.”

“Hahahaha!”

When the higher-ups heard this, they immediately burst into laughter.

“That’s right. I indeed can’t use 100% of my strength, but half of my strength is enough to wipe out an ant like you.”The higher-ups said extremely arrogantly.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. His entire body erupted with brilliant light!

Facing such a peak expert, Qin Yu didn’t have any fear in his heart. Instead, his battle intent was overflowing!

That sky-reaching battle intent shook this world!

Even the higher-ups were alarmed by the high-spirited battle intent on Qin Yu’s body.

His brows twitched, and he said with a cold smile, “Interesting. You’re actually not afraid when facing a mighty figure. Looks like you don’t know what it means to be a mighty figure.”

“Cut the crap!”Qin Yu shouted. His hair danced wildly as he held the mountain of the five peaks in his hand and strode toward the higher-ups!

“Are you really going to fight him yourself?”Immortal Crane frowned.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “Don’t worry. Know Yourself, know your enemy, and you will win every battle.”

With that, Qin Yu roared, and the golden light all over his body exploded to the extreme!

That right fist directly turned into a ball of golden color, and it was almost impossible to see its substance!

The higher-ups had their hands behind their backs, and their eyes were like looking down on an ant. They did not put Qin Yu in their eyes at all.

“Go to hell!”

Qin Yu stepped on the ‘xing’word formula, and in an instant, he arrived in front of the higher-ups!

That heaven-shaking and earth-shaking golden fist, with rolling power and undefeatable battle intent, ruthlessly swung out!

In an instant, the entire space seemed to tremble! This punch had the power to shatter everything!

“Mayfly shaking the tree, you don’t know life and Death!”The higher-ups snorted coldly. He lightly raised his palm to meet Qin Yu!

“Boom!”

That punch smashed fiercely onto the right fist of the higher-ups!

At the moment of collision, the expression of the higher-ups changed slightly!

The power of this punch had far exceeded his imagination!

He hurriedly used his spirit energy to protect his body, but it was still shattered by a single punch!

His entire palm instantly turned into a bloody mist and exploded!

Fresh blood scattered over half of the sky, like Raindrops falling down! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Everyone was shocked! They covered their mouths, as if they couldn’t believe what was happening in front of them was real!

“The stronger you are, the stronger you are. When facing a mighty figure, you can actually erupt with such a dense battle intent,”immortal crane said in a low voice from the side.

When he looked at the higher-ups again, his expression was brazen, and his eyes erupted with dense killing intent!

“No wonder you were able to destroy the foundation that we have worked so hard for a hundred years,”said the higher-ups coldly.

“Qin Yu, think about it. If you join us, I can give you the best resources, allowing you to truly step into the invincible realm!”

Qin Yu sneered, “F * ck you, I don’t want to be in cahoots with you animals!”

The higher-up’s face was cold. He narrowed his eyes and said, “Then I can only bear the pain and kill you.”

After saying that, the higher-up slowly raised his palms and slid slightly in the air, as if he was performing some top-tier spell!

The ground cracked in an instant, as if it could not bear the force, but also as if a Great Dao had broken out of the ground!

A huge divine cauldron appeared between his hands!

This divine cauldron was like a small world, emitting waves of divine might!

With a closer look, there were thousands of divine beasts galloping within the divine cauldron. Ancient marks covered the divine cauldron!

Qin Yu had never seen such a technique before!

A technique that relied on one’s own Great Dao was unrivaled!

Everyone present felt a sense of unease. That divine cauldron seemed to be able to crush the entire world!

Before the divine cauldron appeared, the Qi energy that was spreading over had already crushed Qin Yu’s body, causing it to emit cracking sounds. The golden light seemed to be on the verge of shattering!

At this moment, Qin Yu did not dare to be too arrogant. Even before the fight, Qin Yu could feel the terrifying gap between the two sides!

If the divine cauldron landed, it would probably crush his body and primordial spirit into pieces!

“Qin Yu! Retreat quickly!”The Immortal Crane had the same feeling. His divine sense was extremely sensitive. Such danger made all the hair on his body stand up!

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I have my own countermeasures!”

“Haha, You Ignorant Brat, you don’t know the immensity of Heaven and Earth!”The higher-ups held the cauldron with one hand and sneered.

“I’ll give you one more chance. As long as you are willing to follow me, not only will I not kill you, I will also take you as my disciple and let you enjoy endless wealth and glory. How about it?”The higher-ups questioned loudly.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said with a smile that was not a smile, “This is not a bad idea.”

“Hehe, it seems that you have thought it through.”The higher-ups raised their eyebrows and said.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “It’s a pity that humans and dogs are not on the same path. Let’s talk about it when you become a human in your next life!”
