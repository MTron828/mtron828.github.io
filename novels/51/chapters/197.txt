Chapter 198: Twists and Turns! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

At some point in time, Yan Jiang’s attitude towards Qin Yu changed from doubt to passive trust.

High up in the sky, the large hand was still rolling downwards.

Sand and stones rose with the strong wind. The rolling power almost caused the ground to sink!

And the person below the ground was none other than Qin Yu.

“Mr. Yan, we have to make a move. If anything happens to Qin Yu, Miss Yan will never forgive us!” Gao Rui said anxiously.

Yan Jiang still dragged Gao Rui back and shook his head. “Wait a little longer.”

“Buzz!”

That big hand finally slammed down fiercely!

A huge handprint instantly appeared on the ground!

“It’s over,” Jiang Gu said indifferently with his hands behind his back.

The scene was silent. Everyone held their breath and looked in Qin Yu’s direction.

“It seems that this kid is really dead meat.”

“It’s already pretty impressive that he can hold on for so long in front of an Inner Strength Grandmaster.”

Hong Wu, who wasn’t far away, shook his head. He had mixed feelings.

“It seems that there won’t be any more miracles this time,” Hong Wu murmured.

He had already used the Saintly Body Technique, but he still couldn’t withstand it. How could Qin Yu resist it?

Just as everyone was making their decision, Qin Yu’s body erupted with light once again!

This time, the golden light flourished even more, and even his pores turned dark golden in an instant!

Under the brilliant light, Qin Yu’s body also slowly stood up from the ground.

“As expected!” Yan Jiang was instantly overjoyed. “I knew this kid wouldn’t fall so easily!”

“Qin Yu didn’t die!”

Everyone gasped!

Under the crushing force of Jiang Gu’s palm, not only did Qin Yu not die, but his internal qi was even stronger!

“Fortunately, I have the support of the second level of the Saintly Body Technique.” Qin Yu looked at his destroyed body and couldn’t help but mutter in a low voice.

It was almost impossible to raise his level in a short period of time.

Therefore, Qin Yu used these few days to cultivate the Saintly Body Technique to the second level.

“Little b*stard, you are really lucky.” Jiang Gu’s expression was cold, and his tone contained some anger.

Not being able to get rid of Qin Yu in a short period of time wasn’t a good thing.

What Jiang Gu wanted wasn’t only to kill Qin Yu, but also to use it to establish his power!

Qin Yu looked up at Jiang Gu and said coldly, “Jiang Gu, come and try again.”

Jiang Gu shouted, “You’re courting death!”

As he spoke, Jiang Gu’s figure suddenly disappeared and quickly closed in on him!

“You want to fight me in close combat? That’s exactly what I want!” Qin Yu said coldly.

He clenched his golden fist and faced Jiang Gu head-on!

Gusts of fist wind stirred up explosive sounds in the air!

“Bang! Bang!” The sound kept ringing out, but this time, Qin Yu wasn’t at a disadvantage at all. He even suppressed Jiang Gu!

Jiang Gu’s expression was a little ugly. Qin Yu’s physical body was far beyond his imagination!

Every time they clashed, Jiang Gu’s fist felt waves of numbness!

“How is this possible? He is just a mere Inner Strength Master Hands, so how can his physical body be so strong?!” Jiang Gu became more and more flustered as the battle went on. If this continued, it wouldn’t be good for him!

And the onlookers not far away were even more dumbfounded.

Qin Yu actually had an advantage over Jiang Gu? And he was at the level of an Inner Strength Master Hands?

There was a gap of two levels!

One had to know that even the legendary Ye Qing only fought someone one level above!

“This kid’s potential is beyond imagination.” Yan Jiang was greatly shocked!

At this moment, he completely changed his view!

If Qin Yu was given some time, he might really be able to attain outstanding progress!

“Whoosh!”

Finally, Jiang Gu couldn’t hold on any longer. There was a gust of wind beneath his feet and he quickly retreated!

“I definitely can’t fight this brat with his body.” Jiang Gu shook his slightly numb arm and muttered in a low voice.

The golden light on Qin Yu’s body didn’t diminish. He raised his head and looked at Jiang Gu while his eyes were filled with a strong fighting spirit.

“I’m tired of playing with you.” Jiang Gu said coldly.

“I’m tired of playing with you, too.” There was no expression on Qin Yu’s face.

“D*mn you, I’ll send you to hell right now!” Jiang Gu’s face was ferocious as he roared angrily!

His fists slowly moved through the air, and a terrifying internal qi gathered on his fists!

His fists began to glow, and the light grew bigger and bigger until it was like two huge disks!

Traces of a dangerous internal qi spread out in all directions.

The terrifying pressure suffocated people!

Those who were weaker were shaken until they vomited blood! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Boom!”

With a loud sound, the light on Jiang Gu’s fist turned into two dragon heads!

This technique was the Jiang family’s trump card, the Divine Dragon Fist!

Compared to Jiang Haoran, the power that Jiang Gu displayed was many times stronger!

“It’s the Divine Dragon Fist. Jiang Gu was forced to such an extent!”

“The Divine Dragon Fist was created by the ancestors of the Jiang family. It can even shatter a small mountain!”

“I’m afraid Qin Yu is in trouble!”

Everyone was enveloped by a dangerous internal qi. Even Yan Jiang’s expression turned solemn.

“The power of this Divine Dragon Fist is beyond imagination,” Yan Jiang said in a low voice.

Gao Rui nodded. He said nervously, “Mr. Yan, it’s time to make a move.”

This time, even Yan Jiang had the same thought.

The internal qi released by this punch was too terrifying!

“Find an opportunity to end the fight as soon as possible,” Yan Jiang looked at Gao Rui and said in a low voice.

Gao Rui nodded slightly. He quickly raised his internal qi to the maximum and could make a move at any time.

“They’re finally here.” Looking at the two dragon heads that condensed in the air, Qin Yu’s expression was a little solemn.

“Little b*stard, go to hell!” Jiang Gu’s hair flapped wildly as his fists suddenly smashed down!

The two huge dragon heads instantly came crashing towards him! If one listened carefully, one could even hear a hint of a dragon’s roar!

“Today, I’ll cut off your dragon head!” Qin Yu shouted loudly. With a flip of his palm, a bronze sword fell into his hand!

“Come!” Qin Yu’s body soared into the air. With the bronze sword in his hand, he ruthlessly hacked at the two dragon heads!

“Clang!”

The moment the bronze sword touched the dragon heads, it immediately let out a sound like the collision of steel and iron!

The two dragon heads weren’t affected in the slightest. The bronze sword only left a white scar!

On the other hand, Qin Yu only felt his arm go numb. His thumb split open, and blood dripped down!

“Hahaha, it’s useless! Qin Yu, you’re dead for sure today!” Jiang Gu laughed maniacally.

Qin Yu sighed. He glanced at the bronze sword and whispered, “Looks like I can’t rely on you anymore...”

Seeing Qin Yu’s miserable expression, Yan Jiang hurriedly said, “We can’t wait any longer. Attack!”

However, in the next second, the corner of Qin Yu’s mouth curled up into a smile.

“Fortunately, I made two preparations. Jiang Gu, you will definitely die today!” Qin Yu laughed coldly.

His feet shook, and his hands spread open. The surrounding dark energy gathered towards Qin Yu!

“Do you know that I came to the Eastern Cemetery three days in advance?” Qin Yu grinned coldly.

“Because... I have already set up a formation here! Old b*stard, the one who deserves to die is you!” Qin Yu roared, and the surroundings of the cemetery suddenly flashed with rays of light!
