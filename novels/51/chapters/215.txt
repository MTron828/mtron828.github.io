Chapter 216: King of Chuzhou Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Jiangcheng city lost a large number of merchants in one go, and this matter still caused quite a stir.

But fortunately, Lei Hu’s handling of the matter was quite proper, and he quickly suppressed the news.

A few days later, Jiang Gu suddenly announced the news publicly:

From today onwards, the Jiang family would submit to Qin Yu.

Once this news was released, it immediately caused a stir in the entire Chuzhou!

For a moment, almost everyone, from the great aristocratic families to ordinary families’ small talk after dinner, in the entire province was discussing this matter.

And the more this news spread, the more over the top it became. In just a few days, Qin Yu had become a legendary figure!

“Mr. Qin, take a look at what nickname the internet has given you.” On this day, as soon as Qin Yu woke up, Yao Qing walked over with his phone.

Qin Yu took the phone and saw that they had given Qin Yu a nickname, “King of Chuzhou.”

This immediately gave Qin Yu a headache.

“King of Chuzhou. Even when the Jiang family was at the peak, they didn’t get this title.” Yao Qing sighed.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything.

This had both advantages and disadvantages for Qin Yu.

But clearly, the disadvantages were greater than the advantages.

“Let them call us.” Qin Yu, too apathetic to care about this matter, shook his head.

...

Jiangcheng was a small city that wasn’t well-known, but there were many famous tourist cities around it.

The east side was adjacent to South City, and the south side was adjacent to Qu City. The most praiseworthy city was Bai City, which was in the north.

Although the two places were only a hundred kilometers apart, the difference in prosperity between the two cities was extremely great.

It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that Bai City was the most developed city in Chuzhou.

Because they had a developed economy based on tourism, all kinds of industries were top-notch.

On this day, Qin Yu and Yao Qing arrived at Bai City.

Their cars were also carrying a large amount of supplies.

Other than the herbs that they brought from the warehouse, there was also the bronze sword and the stone statue that they obtained in the provincial capital.

During this period of time, Qin Yu had asked Jiang Gu to look for hundred-year-old herbs, but he had come back empty-handed. For a moment, Qin Yu had a headache.

Therefore, Qin Yu turned his attention to Bai City.

Bai City had a newly developed scenic area. The surrounding scenery was beautiful, and there were few people around.

According to legends, many martial arts experts had come from this place, but times had changed, so martial arts experts were unable to develop this place.

Fortunately, Jiang Gu was an Inner Strength Grandmaster, so he invested in this aspect.

They arrived at the scenic area. The infrastructure here was almost complete, but there were still a lot of workers working.

After getting out of the car, Qin Yu took a deep breath and felt the spiritual energy in the surroundings.

“Although the spiritual energy isn’t dense, it’s considered an excellent place compared to other places,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He planned to set up a spirit gathering array near the scenic area to increase his strength.

As soon as he got out of the car, a woman in professional attire ran over quickly.

She said respectfully, “May I ask if you are the King of Chuzhou, Qin Yu?”

Upon hearing this address, Qin Yu felt uneasy.

“He is the King of Chuzhou.” Yao Qing was rather smug. Before Qin Yu could answer, Yao Qing said proudly.

When the woman heard this, respect flashed in her eyes.

“They all said that you could kill a tiger with one punch and had even killed a true dragon. Is that true?” The woman hurriedly asked.

Qin Yu said, “What is this rumor? It’s getting more and more vicious...”

After some small talk, they found out that this woman was the person in charge of this scenic area. She was also an executive of a company under the Jiang family. Her name was Kong Ping.

And to Kong Ping, Jiang Gu had always been a legendary figure! Jiang Gu’s submission would naturally make Kong Ping admire Qin Yu even more.

Along the way, Kong Ping continuously expressed her respect for Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s ears were almost callused from hearing it continuously. He said helplessly, “Miss Kong, actually, those rumors are all fake. I’m not that legendary.”

However, Kong Ping didn’t believe him at all. She gave Qin Yu a thumbs up and said, “Mr. Qin, you really keep a low profile!”

Qin Yu couldn’t take it anymore. He waved his hand and said, “How about this? You go back to the office first. I’ll take a walk around here by myself.”

“Shall I accompany you? In case you get lost!” Kong Ping said excitedly.

“There’s really no need,” Qin Yu declined.

Kong Ping had no choice but to agree. “Okay, if you need anything, just give me a call.”

After sending Kong Ping away, Qin Yu couldn’t help but wipe the sweat off his forehead.

“F * ck, what is all this?” Qin Yu said helplessly.

Yao Qing rolled his eyes. “You must be very happy, right?”

“F * ck you!” Qin Yu kicked Yao Qing’s butt.

Then, the two of them began to stroll around the scenic area.

The entire scenic area had just been opened, and there was less than a week left before it would be completed.

Therefore, there weren’t many tourists here, but quite a number of workers were working.

In the scenic area, there was a villa area, and this villa area was used to rent to tourists.

Qin Yu walked to the vicinity of this villa area and chose from left and right. Finally, he found a place with relatively rich spiritual energy and stopped.

“This is the place.” Qin Yu stopped in his tracks. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Inform Miss Kong later and ask her to build a fence around the villa here,” Qin Yu said to Yao Qing.

Yao Qing hurriedly nodded and said, “Okay, I got it.”

Since they had chosen the location, Qin Yu and Yao Qing were ready to go to the office and inform Kong Ping.

At this moment, a voice came from not far away.

After turning around, they saw a beautiful young girl scolding a worker who was working.

“Are you blind? Do you know how expensive my shoes are?” The woman scolded.

The worker’s face was full of fear. He said with a trembling voice, “I’m sorry, I... I really didn’t see it. I... I’ll compensate you.”

“Compensate? This pair of shoes costs more than 10,000 yuan. Can you afford it?” The woman said resentfully.

When he heard this number, the worker’s expression instantly became somewhat ugly.

“It’s so expensive...” the worker said softly.

He took out a few hundred yuan bills from his pocket and handed them to the woman shakily.

“I’ll give this money to you first. After the wages are paid, I’ll return the rest of the money to you...” the worker said nervously.

However, this woman slapped the money away.

“Get your dirty hands off me. Why are you so close to me? Are you trying to be a pervert?” The woman chattered.

After saying this, the woman shouted into her phone, “This peasant worker wants to take advantage of me. What do you think we should do?”

“I... I’m not...” the worker immediately panicked.

The woman sneered. “You don’t know who I am, right? I’m a famous influencer, Xiao Yi! Let me tell you, the people in the live stream said that they want you to kneel down and lick my shoes clean, or else I should sue you for being a pervert!”
