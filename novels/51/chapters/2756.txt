Chapter 2757: The Burial an the Third Level

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The third level in the Heavenly Sin might be their funeral bell. As Xiao Hai’s palm moved, a similarly ferocious face appeared.

‘What?”

Cang Yunzi was shocked. He had simulated this kind of power!

“Big brother, your hair! You’ve used the Spacetime Hall’s full power, you’re going to die!”

Fatty glanced at Xiao Hai and saw that he was already very old. He was instantly shocked.

“It’s fine. If my guess is correct, I might not die! Fatty, take back the Spacetime Hall later. Thanks.”

A surge of spacetime power penetrated Xiao Hails body once again. The energy fluctuation in Xiao Hai’s hand accelerated once again.

He seemed to be completely immersed in the exploration of this power.

The power of the Spacetime Hall suddenly disappeared. Xiao Hai fell to the ground powerlessly.

At this moment, he did not have any Saint Power left. He looked like an old man who had reached the end of his life.

“This?”

“This?”

Fatty Situ wanted to cry but had no tears. He couldn’t understand Xiao Hai’s decision. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Why did he have to explore this power and end up dying here?

On the other hand, Lord Alester suddenly raised her head and looked in a certain direction. A thoughtful look appeared in her eyes.

“Xiao Hai!”

Xiao Sheng suddenly stood up. His face was filled with shock.

He did not know why Xiao Hai suddenly fell and died.

He felt as if Xiao Hai had become a different person. This feeling was very unfamiliar to him.

He could not help but become furious when he saw Xiao Hails death.

However, there was no time for him to think about it now. At this moment, the dense fog was released again.

Their location had changed to another scene.

Everyone appeared on a gray stone platform. The bricks on the stone platform could still be seen with cracks and slippery moss.

This was a huge arena. At this moment, the blood-red star above seemed to be within reach.

The arena looked especially terrifying under the terrifying moonlight.

At the edge of the arena was a bottomless abyss.

In the middle of the arena, a three-meter-tall giant appeared.

His face was very ordinary. He would be overlooked even among a few people.

The only thing that made people feel strange was the dense suture marks on his body.

A tombstone that reached straight to the clouds stood beside him.

“Is that Heavenly Sin’s true body?”

Cang Yunzi was also a little puzzled. This was different from the information he had obtained.

However, he did not feel any energy fluctuation from this person.

Blackish-red blood seeped out of the tombstone.

In an instant, the stench of blood filled the entire space.

A moment later, the word ‘death’ was formed on the tombstone.

A Chain of Order appeared above everyone’s head as the word appeared.

The chain was connected to the blood moon in the sky. At the same time, a red light slowly lit up on the chain.

An invincible power entered everyone’s bodies.

Blood mist erupted from countless people’s bodies. Their bodies and divine souls directly turned into blood mist, no longer existing.

Suddenly, there was a slash!

A shocking sword-light lit up on the body of Situ Pangpang’s guardian.

This sword intent was as fast as a swan, comparable to an instant.

The sword intent passed through the power of time and reversed time.

In fact, it was faster than time. It slashed down before the Chain of Order landed on Fatty Situ’s head.

The Chain of Order didn’t fluctuate at all.

It dimmed at an extremely fast speed. In the next moment, the body of Situ Fatty’s Dao Protector exploded.

Fatty Situ’s other eight Dao Protectors also turned into a bloody mist.

Panic appeared on Luo Yu’s face. Countless Dharma Treasures on his body lit up.

In such a hurry, he didn’t know what Dharma Treasure to use.

In a moment, the power transmitted from the blood moon completely crushed him.

Even the Dharma Treasures he had collected for an unknown number of years were also turned into pure energy and fused into the world.

Fatty Situ’s face turned pale. A huge Heavenly Umbrella suddenly opened up.

This Heavenly Umbrella was said to be a Dharma Treasure from the Primordial Chaos. It appeared after the Rain of Order fell.

This umbrella was right below the rain. It had absorbed the most primitive order power.

Even the Path of Heaven could not enter the space where the umbrella was.

Green runes kept dripping from the umbrella.

Terrifying energy bloomed from the ground as every drop of rune fell. It locked the space where Fatty Situ was into an iron bucket.

Crack!

The Chain of Order suddenly split open, but Fatty Situ also spat out a mouthful of blood.

The intense collision caused him to suffer a huge impact.

But he was still alive!

“You can’t kill me. The three Holy Consciousness will look for you and destroy you!”

Liu Si let out a mournful cry at this moment. It was no longer the little Loli’s voice from before.

However, her words seemed especially powerless in this empty arena.

What responded to her was also an invincible power.

“Miss, I’ll take my leave first.”

The Dao Protector next to Lord Alester slashed out with his sword.

His sword wasn’t aimed at the Chain of Order.

Instead, he charged towards Heavenly Sin, who was standing there.

That was a sword that could move mountains and rivers!

For a moment, this sword seemed to suppress the light of the blood moon.

It could shake the mountain and river, or even cause the entire space to tremble slightly.

Die!

The black-robed man thrust his sword forward and let out a wild laugh.

Countless complicated marks suddenly appeared on the sword.

Upon closer inspection, they were all the same as the fourth-level mark on Qin Yu’s body.

In the next moment, the sword of the black-robed man completely disintegrated into pure energy.

The man in black stared blankly at the void in his hand as if he did not understand what had happened.

The power of the Chain of Order penetrated him and turned him into a bloody mist.

Qin Yu’s body seemed to have sensed a destructive crisis. The Night Qi seemed to have transformed into a tornado.

His body was almost transparent. His body seemed to be burning red after a moment, but he did not die.

At this moment, only the little bald boy, Xiao Sheng, Fatty Situ, Lord Alester, Qin Yu, and Cang Yunzi were left.

The others had all died!

Even those who had survived were almost exhausted after taking this attack.

Cang Yunzi was almost on the verge of death while Qin Yu was unable to return to reality.

The little bald boy walked out step by step. Prayer beads coiled in his hands.

Suddenly, the string of prayer beads broke.

The prayer beads rolled onto the ground one by one.

Thump! Thump! Thump!

The crisp sound was particularly loud. The strange thing was that these rotating prayer beads seemed to have eyes..
