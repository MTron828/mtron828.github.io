2345 The Story of the Jee Family

Qin Yu’s face was full of shock. Even in the most ancient history books of Thunder Courtyard, he had never read about this history. This disgusting fact seemed to have been wiped out completely so that people would not know the truth.

In the end, the family members were exiled and even had to change their names to survive. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

If this history were to spread, it would probably disappoint many people.

Qin Yu sighed quietly.

“If it weren’t for the fact that several aristocratic families couldn’t bear to see this, my Ji family would have been exterminated long ago, and the remaining batch of people with tremendously ordinary talent would have been exiled to this galaxy.

“However, they missed out on one thing. One of our ancestors had a breakthrough at the last moment. He was lucky enough to be able to survive and secretly set up countless methods. That’s why the Ji family in purgatory could survive until now, and the remaining people had all changed their names.”

Ji Yue spoke unhurriedly. She looked very calm like she was telling someone else’s story.

“What was the original surname of your Ji family?”

Qin Yu asked softly after a moment of silence.

“Jee. This surname hasn’t been seen for several Path of Heaven years.

“This is the greatest treasure of my Jee family. I’m now giving it to you, Qin Yu.”

Ji Yue waved her hand, and a power of divine sense surged into Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

A massive burst of information exploded in his sea of consciousness, and the information within shocked Qin Yu even more. That was an incomparably enormous wealth. It would cause the nine great aristocratic families to fight for it crazily even in the Holy Region.

“To my Ji family, this wealth is like poison instead. I only hope you can remember our friendship and take care of our family members in the future.”

Ji Yue’s face was ashen. She did not know if she had made the right decision.

She could hire a cultivator at the peak of the Tribulation Transcending Stage with such enormous wealth. It was indeed a tough decision to invest in Qin Yu.

Perhaps it was because Qin Yu had attacked undaunted by the danger he faced in the Solitary Cloud City or some other reason.

Anyway, Ji Yue suddenly made this decision.

“I, Qin Yu, hereby swear that if any member of the Jee family is in trouble, I will do my utmost to protect them. Otherwise, I shall be destroyed both in body and soul.”

A wisp of Qin Yu’s soul drifted out and directly fused with the Path of Heaven after making a vow.

Ji Yue finally made a decision. At this moment, she felt much more relieved.

Qin Yu did not act pretentious and took the soul stone.

As he moved, he had already arrived at the Azure Ridge Continent’s coordinate.

It was the location of the entrance. Qin Yu had been here before, but he could not sense any abnormal fluctuations at all.

The Azure Firmament Sect had been established here for many years but did not sense any unusual fluctuations at all. It was conceivable that the arrangement of this secret realm is tremendously hidden, and without any information, it would be impossible to discover.

A strand of vital energy was injected into the soul stone. It then emitted a ray of light.

Qin Yu’s body was enveloped in the green light, and a powerful suction force instantly pulled him into the void.

A tremendously distant spatial coordinate emitted a massive suction force, pulling Qin Yu over.

Qin Yu only felt his body disintegrate into countless particles. In the blink of an eye, he had passed through numerous spatial planes and landed in an enormous Mystic Realm.

The green light the soul stone emitted protected Qin Yu’s body. Otherwise, the shuttling in the space would probably tear his body apart.

Qin Yu was somewhat amazed. It should be an extremely distant plane. To be able to create a spatial Mystic Realm at such a long distance, he wondered how high the level of this person’s cultivation had reached.

Even the many Mystic Realms that had appeared in the Holy Region could not open up space to this extent.

Before Qin Yu’s eyes was a vast and boundless spatial interface, and its surroundings were connected to dozens of additional separate plane spaces.

These spaces were connected by special spatial rules, and each space was almost filled with an abundant and substantial spiritual energy.

Heavy green rain was pouring from the sky, solidified drops of spiritual energy descending.

Countless spiritual energies crazily surged into Qin Yu’s body. There seemed to be a method to gather spiritual energy here, and over the past tens of thousands of years, spiritual energy had been continuously condensed in these dozens of planes.

The continuous condensation of spiritual energy resulted in the scene that Qin Yu saw before him.

Just these planes alone were enough to cause people to go crazy.

Qin Yu suppressed the ecstasy in his heart and did not want to waste time.

The Traceless Immortal Scripture started circulating, and terrifying spiritual energy surged into his body like seawater.

The glazed holy bone was instantly filled with boundless spiritual energy. As the spiritual energy continued to pour in, Qin Yu’s skeleton began to grow slowly.

One rib, two ribs, slowly, Qin Yu’s entire ribcage was fully grown.

“Not enough!”

The Traceless Immortal Scripture circulated to the utmost again, and the violent suction force turned Qin Yu into a black hole.

The spiritual energy in the entire space was actually decreasing at a speed visible to the naked eye, and the spiritual energy accumulated over ten thousand years ago was slowly depleted.

With a thought, the Green Spirit Tree in the Sumeru ring suddenly opened up as if sensing a massive amount of spiritual energy. Qin Yu could feel the excitement of this spirit tree.

An enormous root pulled out of the air and pierced into all the space nearby. In an instant, all the spiritual energy surged fiercely into the Green Spirit Tree. Emerald green leaves grew on the tree, and drops of dew dripped down from the leaves.

In the blink of an eye, a large quantity of clear dews entered Qin Yu’s body.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s body emitted a blurry green light. The Green Spirit Tree’s clear dews once again condensed the spiritual energy.

The level of this spiritual energy was even close to the chaotic qi of the Bead of Chaos.

Every drop contained immense condensed spiritual energy.

Qin Yu’s holy bone felt swollen and painful when the dews exploded outside. It was the first time he had seen the glazed holy bone’s terrifying absorption of spiritual energy.

Previously, he did not notice the Green Spirit Tree to have such an effect. It was like the Bead of Chaos and the divine sense spirit bead continuously compressing the spiritual energy.

That spiritual energy surged into the Green Spirit Tree to form this clear dew. Previously, the Green Spirit Tree did not absorb so much spiritual energy, so Qin Yu could not detect this heaven-defying effect of the Green Spirit Tree.

With the Green Spirit Tree’s assistance, Qin Yu’s speed of absorbing spiritual energy skyrocketed again.

One day, two days…

Tens of days had passed. Qin Yu was immersed in this kind of cultivation that absorbed spiritual energy crazily.

His glazed holy bone slowly spread from his spine and gradually covered his entire skeleton.

The Glazed Holy Body was recorded to have taken approximately a thousand years to take shape. No one had ever taken shape at such a terrifying speed like Qin Yu’s.
