Chapter 971: Chapter 971, Father’s mighty means 

Tie Dan’s spiritual sense frantically surged into Qin Yu’s body.

Qin Yu slightly closed his eyes and felt his spiritual sense enter his mind.

Very quickly, Tie Dan’s figure appeared in his mind.

The Little Golden Man in Qin Yu’s mind also slowly stood up.

He looked at tie Dan in front of him and said, “Alright, from today onwards, you will temporarily belong to me.”

Tie Dan raised his eyebrows and sneered, “Belong to you? Kid, don’t you think too highly of yourself?”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “What do you mean?”

“What do you mean? hahahahaha!”Tie Dan could not help but burst into laughter.

“How dare you take over my spiritual sense! I have walked more bridges than you have walked!”

“How dare a half-step Martial Saint Act rashly in front of me? You’re still too inexperienced!”

Qin Yu’s expression changed, and he hurriedly said, “I have the Silver Hoop Curse!”

“Silver Hoop Curse? What are those things?”Tie Dan sneered.

His body shook, and the Silver Hoop curse was shattered! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Do you really think you can control me with this thing? You’re too inexperienced!”Tie Dan roared.

“From now on, your body belongs to me. I’ll Swallow Your Spiritual Sense!”

With that, Iron Egg’s spiritual sense rushed towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s expression instantly changed!

Without much time to think, Qin Yu could only brace himself and raise his golden palm to meet Iron Egg!

Unfortunately, Iron Egg’s spiritual sense was too powerful. The moment it came into contact, Qin Yu’s spiritual sense was directly sent flying!

“You dare to act rashly in front of me with such little ability? !”Tie Dan roared crazily.

“You call me tie Dan? I, Your Grandpa Tie!”

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely ugly.

He never expected that the silver hoop curse would be useless in front of tie Dan!

“I was actually deceived by you...”Qin Yu said with some despair.

Tie Dan walked in front of Qin Yu and sneered, “Don’t worry. I will fulfill your unfinished wish for You.”

Then, tie Dan raised his palm and covered Qin Yu’s spiritual sense!

Just as his spiritual sense was about to touch Qin Yu, a bright light suddenly burst out from not far away!

This bright light directly pierced through tie Dan’s palm!

Waves of thick smoke floated up from tie Dan’s palm.

Tie Dan immediately felt pain and hurriedly retreated while shouting, “Who is it? !”

A figure slowly appeared in Qin Yu’s spiritual sense.

This figure was incomparably tall, and the combination of his slender body and his condescending expression made people shudder!

“You... you are a dao protector? !”Tie Dan seemed to have recognized this figure in front of him!

“Father... Father!”Qin Yu recognized this figure even more and immediately shouted out!

Qin Yu’s father looked at tie Dan coldly. That powerful deterrent force made tie Dan Shudder.

The two sides stood in confrontation and no one said anything.

“Wipe out your spiritual sense with just a wave of your hand.”

Finally, Qin Yu’s father spoke.

That voice was incomparably overbearing, as if it carried a powerful penetrating force, shaking tie Dan to the point of unbearable pain!

He held his head and hurriedly said, “I... I understand. Please show mercy. From now on, I will never dare to have any other thoughts...”

However, Qin Yu’s father ignored him and only said coldly, “You have killed countless people and should have been turned into ashes. Today, I will give you a chance to atone for your sins.”

“Yes, yes... I will definitely change my mind...”Tie Dan hurriedly said.

“Father!”Qin Yu rushed to his front and said with some longing, “Father, where... Where are you?”

The tall figure finally looked at Qin Yu.

A trace of undetectable kindness and joy flashed across his cold brows.

“When you are strong enough, you will naturally see me,”he said slowly.

Qin Yu hurriedly said, “Father, I have a lot of things to ask you. Can you... can you not leave in a hurry?”

Qin Yu’s father slowly said, “There are many things that you need to figure out on your own. Good luck.”

After saying this, his figure began to slowly disappear.

No matter how hard Qin Yu screamed, he could not stop him.

Soon, his figure disappeared without a trace.

Qin Yu’s hand froze where he was, with a dazed and shocked expression on his face.

Not far away, tie Dan stood up from the ground.

He rubbed his head and couldn’t help but say, “Why didn’t you tell me earlier that you have such an awesome father?”

Qin Yu looked at tie Dan coldly, then took a deep breath and said, “I let you out, and you actually wanted to swallow my spiritual sense!”

Tie Dan said with a smile, “Look at what you said. Isn’t this all a misunderstanding... don’t worry, there won’t be a second time!”

Qin Yu snorted coldly. He didn’t say anything and ignored tie Dan.

Qin Yu slowly opened his eyes, but he couldn’t calm down for a long time.

“Tie Dan, let me ask you,”Qin Yu suddenly said.

“Don’t F * cking call me tie Dan!”Tie Dan’s voice sounded in his mind.

Qin Yu ignored him and continued to ask, “What kind of existence is a dao guardian? Do You Know My Father?”

Iron egg frowned and said, “Your own father? You’re asking me?”

“I haven’t F * cking met my father yet.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse.

Iron Egg touched his nose and muttered, “Everyone says that every dao guardian has to abandon his wife and children. It seems to be true...”

“Abandon his wife and children? What does that mean?”Qin Yu hurriedly asked.

“In short, the Guardian is not allowed to have selfish motives, or else he will be punished by the heavens. That’s the general meaning,”tie dan muttered.

Qin Yu opened his mouth and said with some sadness, “Why is it like this?”

“Why is it like this? Use your fucking brain and think about it. If you have selfish motives, you will naturally do things unfairly. Then you are not qualified to be a guardian,”tie Dan muttered.

Qin Yu’s expression changed and he hurriedly asked, “Then what if you have selfish motives?”

“Didn’t I say that you will suffer the wrath of Heaven?”Iron Egg muttered.

Qin Yu’s expression instantly changed!

Although Qin Yu had never met his father, his father had left him an inheritance and had helped him many times!

Wasn’t this... considered selfish?

“Is... is there any way to avoid the wrath of Heaven?”Qin Yu continued to ask.

Tie Dan sneered, “No, we are all in the path of Dao and follow the rules of Dao. How can we avoid it?”

Tie Dan paused for a moment and then said with a smile, “Unless you can jump out of this rule or break it. Of course, this is impossible.”
