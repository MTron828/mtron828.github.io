Chapter 1621: Chapter 1,621, sect master’s words Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

His body was surrounded by golden threads that appeared and disappeared.

At this moment, he, who was cultivating, suddenly opened his eyes.

His eyes were filled with indifference and ruthlessness. His eyes were looking in a certain direction.

A moment later, a man in a white robe hurried over.

“Sect master, you are indeed here!”

The deputy sect master could not help but shout in surprise. His face was full of surprise and joy.

He quickly ran to the front of the sect master and half-knelt on the ground. He said excitedly, “Sect master, I have been looking for you for a long time...”

However, the sect master lowered his head and looked down at him. He sighed slightly.

“Why are you looking for me?”The sect master asked quietly.

The deputy sect master said anxiously, “Xiao Hai is dead! The world is in chaos now. The three godly monarchs of the northern land are acting tyrannically. No one can stop them! Now, the entire southern region is waiting for you to return and take charge of the situation!”

Hearing these words, the sect master did not have the slightest fluctuation in his expression. It was as if all of this had nothing to do with him.

Seeing that the sect master did not speak, the deputy sect master continued, “Lord sect master, as long as you return now, the entire Southern Region will be yours! Who would not respect and love you? When that time comes, the Heavenly Cloud sect will definitely be able to rise to a higher level!”

The sect master glanced at him and slowly said, “What use is there for me to have this person’s heart?”

The deputy sect master was startled, and then hurriedly said, “Sect master, this is a great good thing for the Heavenly Cloud sect! Haven’t you always thought highly of the sect?”

“I don’t think highly of it now.”The sect master said indifferently.

The deputy sect master was instantly stunned on the spot.

He did not seem to understand the meaning of the sect master’s words.

Why did the sect master seem to have changed into a different person in such a short period of time?

The thing that he thought so highly of previously was actually so dejected now?

“Lord sect master, even if you don’t think highly of it, you must go back... those three godly monarchs are too arrogant!”The deputy sect master said extremely unwillingly.

The sect master still shook his head and said, “I said I won’t go back.”

The deputy sect master gritted his teeth and could not help but grit his teeth and shout, “Lord sect master, could it be that you’re afraid of the three godly monarchs? Or are you afraid of the Northern Lands?”

A strange expression appeared on the sect master’s face. He could naturally see that the deputy sect master was deliberately provoking him. However, how could such a clumsy method be effective in front of the sect master of the Tianyun sect.

“It’s not worth me taking action now.”After a long while, the sect leader threw down these words.

The sullen expression on the deputy sect leader’s face became even more intense. He stood up angrily and roared, “Xiao Hai sacrificed his life for the sake of the southern region. Yet, you are hiding here and recalling the past. You... you are not worthy of being his brother!”

If it were any other time, the deputy sect leader would definitely not say these words.

However, at this moment, he had risked his life to say these words.

The sect master remained calm and unmoved.

“Xiao Hai is Xiao Hai, and I am me. Everyone has their own pursuits and thoughts. Who can force who?”The sect master said in a low voice.

How could the deputy sect master listen to these words? He clenched his teeth and said, “No matter what, you have to go back!”

The sect master remained silent and closed his eyes again.

The deputy sect master was furious. Filled with fighting spirit, he roared, “If you don’t go back, I Will Carry You Back!”

With that said, he unleashed all his strength and grabbed at the sect master’s arms!

But what was surprising was that even though the deputy sect master used all his strength, the sect master did not move an inch.

The deputy sect master could not wait any longer. He said angrily, “If you don’t go back, I will die in front of you right now!”

“Do you think I Care?”The sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect said indifferently.

“Then I will annoy you to death! If you have the guts, kill me!”The deputy sect master roared.

After saying that, his entire body erupted with flames. One mark after another rushed towards the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect!

Countless rays of light enveloped the sect master, but they were unable to move him in the slightest. They were even unable to stop his cultivation.

“Ah! ! !”

The deputy sect master was so angry that he raised his head and roared. He swept his gaze around him and roared, “I know this is your hometown. If you don’t return, I will destroy this place!”

These words finally moved him.

He looked at the deputy sect master coldly and said, “Do you really want to die?”

“That’s right. Either you go back with me, or you kill me!”The deputy sect master’s tone was equally determined.

The sect master looked at the deputy sect master coldly and said, “Alright, then I will satisfy you.”

After saying that, he raised his palm and gently pointed in the direction of the sect master.

A terrifying and fierce power immediately shot toward the deputy sect master!

The deputy sect master’s expression changed drastically. He hurriedly took out all his protective dharma treasure in an attempt to block this attack!

However, the top-tier Dharma treasure that the Heavenly Cloud sect had bestowed upon him was as fragile as a piece of paper and was instantly destroyed! Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

That power poured onto the deputy sect master’s body.

The deputy sect master’s eyes froze, then he fell to the ground and lost consciousness.

The sect master looked in the direction of the deputy sect master and slowly stood up.

He stood in front of the deputy sect master and said in a low voice, “Don’t worry. When the master of the northern land wakes up, I will go to the northern land.”

...

When the deputy sect master woke up again, he was already lying on his bed.

There was a large group of people around him, as if they were waiting for him to wake up.

The deputy sect master opened his eyes in a daze. The moment he woke up, he suddenly stood up and said anxiously, “Has the sect master returned?”

“No, didn’t you go to look for him?”The people beside him asked one after another.

The deputy sect master’s expression was extremely unsightly.

He knew that the sect master must have sent him back.

“Why must you do this...”the deputy sect master clenched his fists, as if he didn’t dare to believe it.

He suddenly got out of bed, gritted his teeth and said, “I still want to go. No matter what, I will find you back!”

However, when he came to the Laiqu Pond again, the sect master was long gone. No one knew where he had gone.

...

Mount Dayue.

Thousands of beast spirit pills had been refined in front of Qin Yu.

However, his divine sense had also reached its limit, and his condition was extremely poor.

“Pu!”

At this moment, Qin Yu spat out a mouthful of blood, and his entire person instantly became extremely dispirited.

When Wen Wanyun saw this, he hurriedly rushed up to support Qin Yu.

“Damn it, quickly go and rest for this daddy!”Wen wanyun said furiously.

Qin Yu opened his eyes with difficulty. He opened his mouth and was about to speak, but he discovered that there was a large group of people surrounding him.

And these people were mostly the sect leaders of the various large sects.

“This... What’s going on?”Qin Yu said in a somewhat dazed manner.

Wen wanyun snorted coldly, “I want to let them know how hard you worked and how hard it was to refine the Beast Spirit Pill! At least let them know how grateful they are! Otherwise, it won’t be in vain!”
