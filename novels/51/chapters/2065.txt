2066 Entering the Chaos Grave

Holy Lord Si looked at the supreme bone in Jiang Wushuang’s hand and could not help but sneer and say, “I’m afraid that your bone will break if I touch it, will it?”

“Uncle Si, don’t you know the background of the two who guarded Big Graves?” Jiang Wushuang shook his head and said. “It’s been too long. Even though they’re at the Tribulation Stage, their bones should have long lost their toughness.

“Therefore, the bone in my hand might really be the supreme bone.”

After hearing Jiang Wushuang’s words, Holy Lord Si suddenly trembled a little as if he was reminded of something.

“Why don’t I sell you the supreme bone in my hand? I just want the same conditions as Xuan Jizi,” Jiang Wushuang laughed and said.

The veins bulged on Holy Lord Si’s forehead. He suppressed his anger and said, “You spent only 100 million spirit coins, but you’re asking for the Si family’s immortal scripture?”

“You really gave the immortal scripture to Xuan Jizi?” Jiang Wushuang made a tremendously exaggerated expression of shock.

Holy Lord Si was furious to the extreme. He gritted his teeth and said, waving his sleeve, “Let’s go!”

After they left, a trace of contempt appeared on Jiang Wushuang’s face.

“Everyone says the Holy Lord of the Si family is a fool. Without a son with a chaotic body, he would have been kicked out of the Si family long ago,” Jiang Wushuang muttered.

“I didn’t believe it in the past, but now it seems true.”

Obviously, this Jiang Wushuang looked harmless but was actually incredibly vicious.

“Holy Son, we don’t have the chaotic blood. How should we enter the Chaos Grave?” an elderly man by the side walked over and asked.

“Isn’t that simple?” Jiang Wushuang said with a faint smile.

Then Jiang Wushuang looked around and said indifferently, “Isn’t the other chaotic body hiding here?”

Qin Yu’s expression instantly changed drastically upon hearing this!

The Holy Son actually knew he was hiding here. Could it be that he had noticed it much earlier?

“Come out. Since you have the supreme bone, you will definitely come here,” Jiang Wushuang said indifferently.

“If you don’t come out, I’ll tell Holy Lord Si.”

After saying this, Jiang Wushuang pretended to be leaving.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and could only brace himself to walk out.

When Jiang Wushuang saw Qin Yu’s figure, he smiled in satisfaction.

“I knew you were hiding here.” Jiang Wushuang’s eyes turned into crescent moons when he smiled. He did not look like a vicious guy at all.

Qin Yu bowed slightly to Jiang Wushuang and said, “Nice to meet the Holy Son of the Jiang family.”

“There’s no need to be so polite. If it weren’t for you, the supreme bone wouldn’t have reached my hands,” Jiang Wushuang laughed and said.

“Did Jiang He tell you that I was the one who gave the supreme bone?” Qin Yu frowned and said.

“Of course not.” Jiang Wushuang shook his head. “All of this is just my guess. If you had the supreme bone, you would surely come.”

“But I think anyone with a supreme bone would come.” Qin Yu obviously didn’t believe it.

Jiang Wushuang squinted his eyes and said with a smile, “You’re right. If an ordinary person had the supreme bone and asked the Jiang family for a tribulation magical artifact, they would surely come, even if they didn’t have the chaotic blood.”

“But if it’s you, the probability of you coming is even higher. The probability would be 30% and 70% for these two situations. Being you is 70%, but now, it’s 100%,” Jiang Wushuang said with a smile.

“In that case, there was also a gambling element in your voice just now?” Qin Yu asked in shock.

“That’s right! I bet on 30%. I won’t lose anything,” putting away the folding fan in his hand, Jiang Wushuang said with a smile.

Qin Yu sized up Jiang Wushuang in front of him and could not help but exclaim in his heart. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

This Jiang Wushuang was not simple. Even if he did not have super strong cultivation, he could probably take over the Jiang family in the future.

“Alright, let’s not talk about this anymore. I want to borrow some blood from you. I don’t think you’ll reject, right?” Jiang Wushuang said with a smile.

Qin Yu glanced around and smiled bitterly. “Do I have the right to reject?”

“That’s true. I like to deal with smart people. Please proceed,” Jiang Wushuang said.

Qin Yu did not reject. He gave Jiang Wushuang a drop of his blood, and Jiang Wushuang promised Qin Yu a promise that they would enter the Chaos Grave together. If anything happened, he would guarantee Qin Yu’s safety.

Being together with the Jiang family, Qin Yu did not have to worry about the trio.

Without further delay, they immediately stepped into the Chaos Grave.

The moment they stepped in, the tribulation path inscription in Qin Yu’s body began to shine. The Mysterious Heavenly Mirror from the Jiang family even hung above Qin Yu’s head. Rays of light enveloped him to resist the death qi.

Qin Yu followed Jiang Wushuang and walked step by step into the Chaos Grave. Due to the protection of the chaotic blood, those tomb slaves did not attack Qin Yu and the others.

From time to time, light overflowed the Chaos Grave. The deeper they went in, the thicker the chaotic qi became. Even the Mysterious Heavenly Mirror began to shake a little as if it was trying to resist the chaotic qi with all its might.

Soon, an enormous grave appeared in front of them! A bluestone Big Grave appeared in front of them!

There was a moderate-sized entrance on the bluestone Big Grave with densely packed marks around it.

These seemed to be the marks of fights. There were countless potholes.

“These are the traces left behind by the nine great aristocratic families when they attacked earlier,” Jiang Wushuang said in a low voice.

“It seems that the attack of the nine great aristocratic families was not in vain,” Qin Yu added.

“Mmm,” Jiang Wushuang responded. “So many people died, and so many Saint Weapons were damaged. It would be too horrifying if not even a trace was left behind.”

Qin Yu and Jiang Wushuang stopped in their tracks at the same time.

They looked at the entrance and couldn’t help but panic.

Looking through the entrance, it was pitch-black inside, and almost nothing could be seen.

Even though Qin Yu activated his desolate divine eye, he could not see through it.

Qin Yu suddenly remembered! Previously, when he was facing the chaotic qi, the desolate divine eye could not see through it either!

“Inside… is dense chaotic qi, extremely dense chaotic qi!” Qin Yu exclaimed.

The reason for his judgment was that the visibility of the desolate divine eye was even lower this time.

And within the chaotic qi, tremendously horrifying creatures could be born, such as those mysterious green creatures.

The denser the chaotic qi was, the more horrifying the creatures would be! For example, the enormous palm that appeared earlier was most probably produced by the chaotic qi!

“As long as we deduce correctly, this trip won’t be dangerous,” Jiang Wushuang said.

Although he said that, he had no intention of stepping into it.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “Since there’s no risk, I’ll have to trouble Holy Son to go first.”

Waving his hand repeatedly, Jiang Wushuang said, “No, no, no! I know Brother Qin needs the inheritance in the Chaos Grave more than I do. Therefore, I will give it to you. I will assist you.”
