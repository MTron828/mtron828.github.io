Chapter 99: The Liu Family of South City Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Young Master Liu turned around and gave Qin Yu a cold glance.

At this moment, Qin Yu was also looking at him.

Their eyes met, and Qin Yu’s brows furrowed tightly.

“This guy is quite discerning.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

It seemed that it was almost impossible to get a bargain today.

Qin Yu didn’t think any further. He raised his hand and shouted, “200 million.”

As soon as he said this, everyone present gasped!

“Spending 200 million to buy a stalk of wild grass?”

“This guy must be crazy. Where did this young master come from? Why does he look so unfamiliar?”

Although these people were very wealthy, 200 million wasn’t a small amount of money to them.

Moreover, rich people were more penny-pinching and wise with money.

“250 million.” At this moment, Young Master Liu raised the number plate in his hand.

This time, everyone was even more shocked!

The bid was raised again?

“300 million,” Qin Yu said with a cold expression.

Qin Yu was determined to get this Chinese knotweed.

Young Master Liu looked a little unhappy. He turned around to take a look and then shouted, “500 million!”

As soon as he said this, everyone was shocked!

Even Qin Yu’s expression was a little ugly!

He raised it to 500 million at the drop of a hat. This price was indeed too over the top!

Qin Yu only had 2 billion, and it was borrowed. Spending 500 million on a Chinese knotweed was indeed a little inappropriate.

For a moment, Qin Yu fell into deep thought.

“600 million!” Yan Ruoxue shouted.

Qin Yu was stunned. He hurriedly looked at Yan Ruoxue and shook his head. “Miss Yan, I definitely can’t let you spend money this time. It’s too expensive!”

Yan Ruoxue blinked and smiled. “It’s okay. It doesn’t matter whose money you spend.”

Qin Yu suddenly didn’t know what to say. Even if the Yan family was rich, Qin Yu felt guilty about it.

“Eight hundred million!” Young Master Liu shouted angrily!

Yan Ruoxue snorted and said, “One hundred million!”

“Hiss...”

Everyone at the scene looked at these two!

One stalk of Chinese knotweed was being sold for one hundred million. This probably broke the record of the South City auction!

Yan Ruoxue gazed at Qin Yu’s face and a smile appeared on her face.

“I’m leaving soon. Treat it as my last gift to you,” Yan Ruoxue thought to herself.

When the price was raised to one billion, Young Master Liu, who was in the front row, finally stopped talking.

“He’s finally stopped,” Qin Yu said with a frown.

Just when Qin Yu thought he was going to get it, the old man beside Young Master Liu suddenly stood up.

He turned around and looked in Qin Yu’s direction, he cupped his hands and said, “Sir, this is the Liu family’s young master, Liu Shihui. If you are willing to give us this Chinese knotweed, the Liu family of South City will remember this favor.”

“The Liu family of South City?”

“They are actually members of the Liu family. No wonder they are so generous!”

“The Liu family is truly top-notch in South City. Rumor has it that their family has many hangers-on!”

“That’s right. They are different from ordinary wealthy people. The Liu family is considered the most mysterious family in South City.”

Liu Shihui couldn’t help but smile when he heard the comments of the crowd.

It was obvious that Liu Shihui was quite satisfied with everyone’s attitude.

Meanwhile, his old servant also swept his gaze around proudly.

“South City’s Liu family...” Yan Ruoxue muttered in a low voice. No one knew what she was thinking.

Qin Yu looked in the direction of the old servant and cupped his hands politely. “Sir, this Chinese knotweed is also very important to me, so... I’m sorry.”

When he heard this, Liu Shihui was extremely displeased.

The old servant frowned and said, “Young man, you might not know what kind of status our family has in South City, so I suggest you learn more about it.”

“Moreover... Having the Liu family owe you a favor isn’t any less beneficial than this Chinese knotweed,” the old servant said with some pride.

Despite hearing this, Qin Yu still shook his head and said, “I’m sorry, I’m not very interested in face, so let’s have a fair competition.”

When he heard Qin Yu’s words, Liu Shihui’s expression finally turned cold.

He slowly stood up, turned his head to look at Qin Yu, and said in a cold voice, “Kid, it’s best to consider the consequences of your conduct. Offending the Liu family isn’t a wise choice.”

“Thank you for your warning, Mr. Liu. I’ll take note,” Qin Yu said in a neither servile nor haughty manner.

Then, he sat down and no longer paid attention to Liu Shihui.

Liu Shihui clenched his fists. He took a deep breath and said in a threatening tone, “Kid, I hope you can safely take away this Chinese knotweed.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more, but he was slightly worried inside.

Although he had never heard of the Liu family, from the old servant by Liu Shihui’s side, the Liu family was definitely very powerful.

Even one of the servants was a high-level practitioner that Qin Yu couldn’t see through. This was enough to prove the strength of the Liu family.

“Don’t worry,” Yan Ruoxue comforted him.

Qin Yu sighed. He looked at Yan Ruoxue and asked, “Have you heard of the Liu Family?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Yan Ruoxue nodded and said, “Yes, they are quite famous in the South City. There are many hangers-on, so they can’t be underestimated.”

“Young man, you’d better give this Chinese knotweed to Liu Shihui. Otherwise... the consequences will be unimaginable,” a middle-aged man next to Qin Yu warned.

“That’s right. Even if you bid for it, you might not be able to take it away. It’s better to seize the opportunity to have them owe you a favor,” another person warned.

Qin Yu nodded and said politely, “Thank you for your kind intentions, but this Chinese knotweed is very important to me, so... I still want to try it.”
