1907 The Terror of the Stone Stairways

The jade-like stone stairways were incredibly white as if symbolizing a good implication.

However, the better things seemed to be, the more disasters they would bring.

Qin Yu walked up the stone stairways, step by step.

A secret technique had been set up in the entire city, and no one could use their spiritual power. As a result, everyone was no different from ordinary people.

Fortunately, Qin Yu’s physical strength was far better than that of ordinary people. Therefore, it was not too hard for him to walk on the stone stairways.

However, the others were not as lucky as Qin Yu. Many people were lying on the stone stairways, panting. Some of them had their feet worn out or more than half of their bones exposed to obtain the Yan family’s approval.

Qin Yu’s brows were tightly furrowed. The people on the stone stairways looked like refugees. They looked so pathetic.

He looked at a cultivator beside him. Half of the bones of this cultivator’s foot had worn off, but he still kept climbing up with difficulty.

“Why must you enter the Yan family?” Qin Yu asked, feeling puzzled. “What’s the use of it?”

The other party glanced at Qin Yu and said, “Isn’t you the same?”

“It’s not the same,” Qin Yu said with a bitter smile. “At least I pay lesser than you do.”

The cultivator wasn’t angry. He sighed and said, “That’s right. This stone stairway is used to select the more outstanding people. As soon as one steps on it, they are recorded.”

“Recorded? What do you mean by that?” Qin Yu was puzzled.

The cultivator pointed at the Yan family and said, “Everyone has different time taken to climb up. The shorter the time, the higher the score. If you exceed a month, it’s meaningless even if you can climb up.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Qin Yu suddenly realized why these people didn’t want to give up even though their feet were worn out.

Not only this cultivator, but all the other cultivators around him were in the same state, looking in great pain.

Qin Yu’s eyes were filled with compassion that could not be concealed.

The cultivator standing aside seemed to have read Qin Yu’s mind. He sighed and said, “When you climb higher, you’ll see even more tragic scenes.”

Qin Yu could understand. The people above would only be more severely injured, and some might have even died on the stone stairways.

“If you can’t make it, why don’t you choose to leave?” Qin Yu asked with confusion.

The cultivator snorted and said, “We’re already halfway through. Who’s willing to give up? Moreover, climbing to this position has exhausted all of our physical strength, and our body is worn out to the extreme. No matter if you go up or down, we can’t avoid death. So why not we try?”

Qin Yu was speechless.

In that situation, it seemed like it was in a dilemma.

“Even if we enter the Yan family, what are the benefits?” Qin Yu sighed.

“There are many benefits. The Yan family treats cultivators quite well. Every month, they will receive ten bottles of liquid of various herbs and have the chance to listen to the dao technique,” the cultivator said.

“Many cultivators succeeded in the Yan family. Some even took the opportunity to enter the True Saint cultivation realm. Who wouldn’t be envious?”

Qin Yu was silent, sighing in his heart.

Perhaps Qin Yu had already got out from the lowest-level rogue cultivators and no longer understand their actual life and cultivation conditions.

The two continued to climb. Qin Yu looked much more relaxed. Under the circumstance of not being allowed to use the spiritual power, Qin Yu’s chaotic body had an advantage.

However, Qin Yu knew he had to keep a low profile when he went to the Yan family to avoid being seen through. So, he planned to finish climbing the stone stairways in a month.

As the two were climbing, someone suddenly flew into the sky on a divine artifact and landed on the mountain range of the Yan family.

Seeing that, Qin Yu said with confusion, “Why didn’t that person climb the stone stairways?”

“You’re overthinking. He was invited by the Yan family, so he naturally doesn’t need to climb any stone stairways and won’t be suppressed by the formation,” the other party explained.

Qin Yu nodded and didn’t say anything else.

“But come to think of it, with your look, they might not want you even if you enter the Yan family,” the cultivator said with a smile.

Qin Yu touched her face and remembered his ugly face.

“Don’t tell me the Yan family also takes one’s appearance into consideration!” Qin Yu said with confusion.

“Of course, they do. When someone enters the Yan family, he’ll be representing the family. If he is too ugly, won’t he be a disgrace to the family?” the cultivator said with a smile.

Qin Yu had a bad feeling in his heart.

D*mn it! This ugly face might cause trouble.

Qin Yu bent his body and looked down, but he could no longer see it clearly.

It meant he had already reached a very high position. It was not realistic for him to retreat now. He could only take one step at a time.

The two continued to climb up. After another three days, the cultivator was exhausted. The injury on his foot had become even more severe, leaving bloody marks on the stone stairways.

The blood flowed down the stone stairways and disappeared without a trace in less than half a second. It was as if it had evaporated.

“No wonder the stone stairways are so clean,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

“Brother, I’m afraid I can’t make it.” The cultivator waved his hand at this point.

Sitting on the stone stairway, he looked exhausted, and his internal qi was quite bleak.

“What are you going to do then?” Qin Yu frowned and asked.

“I don’t know,” he looked somewhat calm and said with a smile. “I’ll most likely die on these stone stairways. You go ahead.”

Qin Yu opened his mouth, but he knew if he helped, he would probably cause unnecessary trouble.

Therefore, Qin Yu nodded and said, “Good luck to you.”

After saying that, Qin Yu continued to climb up.

The higher they went up, the more casualties there would be. The surrounding stone stairways were no longer as clean as before because there was too much blood, causing the stone stairways to lose their ability to absorb blood.

Qin Yu stopped in his tracks when he saw the scene.

...

He gritted his teeth, turned around, and returned to the cultivator.

“Why did you come back?” The cultivator was surprised to see Qin Yu.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He took a pill from his Spatial Magic Artifact and stuffed it into the cultivator’s mouth.

This pill wasn’t worth much, but it could heal wounds.

After taking the pill, the cultivator’s wound immediately improved a lot.

“Let’s go together,” Qin Yu said.

The cultivator opened his mouth and looked at Qin Yu in front of him. He smiled bitterly and said, “Pills are rare on these stone stairways. I don’t know how many people could survive with just one pill. But they still died on the stone stairways in the end.”

It wasn’t overstating to say that on these stone stairways, pills were like a mouthful of water in the desert, extremely precious.

“Thank you very much.” The cultivator cupped his hands at Qin Yu.

“I can only help you this time,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice. “As for whether you can climb up, it depends on your luck.”
