Chapter 75: No Way? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Shen Yun became even angrier.

He never thought that Wei Jiang would admit it directly and not show him any respect at all!

“Wei Jiang, you’ve gone too far!” Shen Yun gritted his teeth.

“I don’t believe that I can’t do without Chuzhou Bank!” Shen Yun shouted and turned to leave.

“Hold on.” At this moment, Wei Jiang stopped Shen Yun.

Shen Yun was delighted. He thought that there was still a chance, so he quickly turned around.

Unexpectedly, Wei Jiang pointed at the gift box on the table and said, “You didn’t take your things.”

This made Shen Yun even angrier. He pointed at Wei Jiang and said, “Just you wait!”

After saying this, Shen Yun rushed out of the door!

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu sneered inside.

Shen Yun relied on his affluence and connections to act high and mighty while treating ordinary people like dirt. This kind of person would get what he deserved sooner or later.

After he left, Wei Jiang looked at Qin Yu and said with a smile, “Mr. Qin, this contract requires a total of sixty-four signatures. Don’t miss any.”

“Don’t worry,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

It took him nearly twenty minutes to sign the contract.

After Qin Yu signed the contract, Wei Jiang took out a black bank card.

“This bank card is a VIP card of Chuzhou Bank. As long as you have this card, you will always be a VIP customer of Chuzhou Bank,” Wei Jiang said.

“With this card, most high-end stores will give you special treatment. Of course, it is only limited to Chuzhou,” Wei Jiang continued.

Qin Yu, feeling a myriad of emotions, caressed his bank card.

Just a few weeks ago, Qin Yu had nothing, but now, he had a bank card worth two billion yuan.

Such a drastic change felt surreal to Qin Yu.

“Mr. Wei, if there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave first,” Qin Yu stood up and said.

Wei Jiang nodded and said, “Okay, Mr. Qin. If there’s anything, we’ll keep in contact.”

After walking out of the Chuzhou Bank, Qin Yu found Song Wei and Li Yan waiting for him at the door.

“Qin Yu!” As soon as Song Wei saw Qin Yu, she trotted over.

Li Yan walked in front of Qin Yu sheepishly and said with a sheepish smile, “Mr. Qin, I was ignorant of your identity before. I hope you don’t mind.”

Qin Yu glanced at Li Yan and shook his head with a smile.

Although Li Yan made disparaging remarks previously, he was still a good person. He protected his cousin and didn’t betray her for personal benefits.

“Why are you still here?” Qin Yu asked.

Song Wei smiled and said, “You have helped me so much. Of course I have to thank you properly.”

“Yes, yes, yes. Mr. Qin, you didn’t know that Chuzhou Bank directly arranged for Xiao Wei to replace Mr. Zhang!” Li Yan said hurriedly.

“I’m the manager of the Chuzhou Bank. How incredible.” Then, Li Yan couldn’t help but exclaim in awe.

Qin Yu was also a little surprised. He didn’t expect Wei Jiang to show him so much respect.

“Qin Yu, let me treat you to dinner tonight,” said Song Wei.

“There’s no need for that.” Qin Yu shook his head.

He didn’t want to get involved with any woman except Yan Ruoxue, and Song Wei was no exception.

“Mr. Qin, no matter what, I have to treat you to dinner tonight! You rarely come here, so let me do my best as a host,” Li Yan said with extreme enthusiasm.

Seeing Li Yan’s hospitality, Qin Yu couldn’t refuse.

Helpless, Qin Yu could only nod and agree.

They made an appointment at six in the afternoon, and then Qin Yu returned to the hotel.

After Qin Yu returned to the hotel, Yao Qing was waiting for Qin Yu in the hotel.

As soon as he saw Qin Yu, Yao Qing hurried over.

“Mr. Qin, why didn’t you call me?” Yao Qing said somewhat anxiously.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Seeing that you were sleeping soundly, I didn’t have the heart to disturb you.”

Yao Qing said with slight embarrassment, “I’m a heavy sleeper. Next time, you can wake me directly. If it really doesn’t work, you can beat me up. I will definitely wake up.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh.

On the other hand, after Shen Yun left the Chuzhou Bank, he wasn’t in a hurry to leave the provincial capital. He first went to all the major banks in Chuzhou, but unfortunately, all the banks rejected the Shen family’s loan.

And the reason was the same: they didn’t think highly of the Shen family’s future and thought that the Shen family didn’t have the ability to repay the loan.

Shen Yun used countless connections, but all of them were rejected.

This made Shen Yun come to a sudden realization. Obviously, someone was deliberately messing with the Shen family. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be rejected by all the banks!

And there was only one person who could do all of this in Chuzhou.

That was Yan Ruoxue. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“She clearly said that she wouldn’t meddle in this matter!” Shen Yun was instantly dumbfounded and furious!

But in the face of the Yan family, the Shen family was too weak.

Shen Yun held his phone and after much hesitation, he finally dialed Yan Ruoxue’s number.

The call was quickly picked up and Yan Ruoxue’s cold voice came from the other end.

“Mr. Shen, why are you free to call me?” Yan Ruoxue’s voice always seemed to sound calm and graceful.

Shen Yun took a deep breath and said with a sheepish smile, “Miss Yan, didn’t you say that you wouldn’t meddle in the dispute between the Shen family and Qin Yu?”

On the other end, Yan Ruoxue said in shock, “I indeed didn’t meddle in this matter. Why are you asking this?”

Shen Yun suppressed his anger and said, “Then why did Wei Jiang reject the Shen family’s loan and approve the loan to Qin Yu instead?!”

Yan Ruoxue smiled and said, “Uncle Shen, you’ve really misunderstood me. This wasn’t instigated by me, but by Qin Yu himself.”

Shen Yun said angrily, “How is this possible?! He is just a good-for-... an ordinary person. How can he have any influence to Wei Jiang?!”

“Uncle Shen, don’t you know? Qin Yu cured Mrs. Wei’s illness. Wei Jiang loves his wife the most.” Yan Ruoxue smiled and said.

“No way. The Shen family is so prominent, yet you guys actually aren’t a match against just Qin Yu alone?” Yan Ruoxue’s words had a hidden insinuation.

Shen Yun was stunned on the spot.

Could it be... that Qin Yu really did everything himself?

“Uncle Shen, if there’s nothing else, I’ll hang up first,” Yan Ruoxue said with a smile.

After saying that, she directly hung up the phone.

Shen Yun sat in the car with a livid expression on his face. No one knew what he was thinking about.

“Mr. Shen, where are we going now?” The driver asked.

Shen Yun said with a cold expression, “Let’s go back to Jiangcheng first.”
