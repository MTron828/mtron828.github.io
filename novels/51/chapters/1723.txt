Chapter 1724: The Terrifying Yuan Xiu Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

No one had expected that Yuan Xiu’s technique would be broken in front of Rashomon.

Xiao Sheng’s body was still trapped by the chains, so Yuan Xiu did not panic.

He looked coldly at Xiao Sheng and said, “It’s been many years since I’ve met an opponent like you. Not bad. I’m very satisfied.”

Xiao Sheng didn’t say anything more. His body was radiating with light, as though he was trying to break free from the chains binding him.

However, Yuan Xiu would not give Xiao Sheng such an opportunity. He raised his hands and grabbed the countless chains.

Yuan Xiu said, “It’s a pity that you’re only at the half-step Reversion Void Stage. You have to die today!”

Yuan Xiu bellowed as he exerted force in his hands. The chains binding Xiao Sheng began to clatter.

Xiao Sheng’s body seemed to be on the verge of being torn apart by the chains, and his bones emitted cracking sounds. Fresh blood flowed down from his pores, dyeing his snow-white robes red.

“Oh my, Xiao Sheng’s limbs are about to be torn apart!” Someone exclaimed, and his expression changed drastically.

The outcome of Xiao Sheng’s battle would affect the future of the entire Nanzhou. No one would not worry.

However, right at this critical moment, Xiao Sheng’s vision suddenly emerged. With a violent shake of his massive palm, he actually shattered the chains.

Xiao Sheng took the opportunity to retreat. A huge vision hung behind him, giving off an extraordinary aura.

“Humph, you’re quite capable indeed.” Yuan Xiu snorted.

Xiao Sheng was panting slightly. It was obvious that he was having a hard time facing such a terrifying Yuan Xiu.

As for Yuan Xiu, he was not in a good state either. The magical artifact that had been formed was extremely taxing on him. All of his techniques were connected to the Great Dao, so the amount of energy they consumed was unimaginable.

“I can’t drag this on any longer,” Yuan Xiu said coldly.

He raised his palm and condensed another dao technique.

A shining axe appeared in his palm.

The axe glowed with a dark light, and the countless runes on it also glowed as if it was about to come back to life.

Those with sharp eyes saw through the origin of this axe and couldn’t help but be shocked.

“It’s an ancient battleaxe! Yuan Xiu can actually form an ancient battleaxe!”

“Ancient battleaxe? The axe that was rumored to have been used by Heavenly Emperor?”

“Yes! He was one of the most powerful cultivators in the world. It was said that his axe could split the world in two and destroy the Galaxy with a casual wave!”

The methods of Yuan Xiu shocked everyone.

At this moment, Xiao Sheng’s face had also turned slightly grave.

Of course, he knew about the ancient battleaxe. It was a legendary magical artifact with boundless power.

Even though this was only condensed by Yuan Xiu’s technique, its power was still not to be underestimated.

“Xiao Sheng, what are you going to use to block it? With your Rashomon?” Yuan Xiu’s shout reverberated throughout the entire area.

Xiao Sheng did not say anything more. He raised his palm and formed Rashomon.

As expected, he was really going to try to use Rashomon to collect this condensed ancient battleaxe.

“Hahaha, do you think it’ll work? Your Rashomon is not invincible!” Yuan Xiu raised his head and shouted.

He didn’t say anything more as he held the axe with both hands and slashed at Xiao Sheng.

This was a strange scene. The axe seemed to split the chaos and was about to split the world into two.

All the internal qi was obliterated in front of this axe, and the Great Dao also began to collapse. Everything was cut in half by this axe.

“Quickly run!”

Someone cried out in alarm and hurriedly ran back.

The internal qi that rippled out from the axe instantly turned many people who could not escape in time into blood mist.

Even a cultivator at Reversion Void Stage would find it difficult to get up from his knees under this powerful pressure.

Xiao Sheng activated Rashomon with both hands, and a pitch-black light that was like a black hole grew larger and larger. In the end, it seemed to have covered the entire area, turning everything into pitch-black.

Looking at the dao techniques the two had developed, Sima Bei and Yong Ji did not dare to stay any longer and fled far away.

Their faces were ugly, full of shock and panic.

“It’s too powerful. Is this the top-tier battle?” Sima Bei sighed from the bottom of his heart.

Yong Ji clenched his fists tightly. He was unwilling to accept this.

Such a battle was not something he could get involved in.

One should know that Xiao Sheng was only at the half-step Reversion Void Stage. How terrifying would he be if he were to reach the Reversion Void Stage?

No one knew.

“Swish!”

At this moment, the axe was already slashing over.

The void shattered, leaving no place to hide. No one could escape.

Rashomon became more and more intense and finally met the ancient battleaxe.

“Boom!”

At the moment of collision, Rashomon trembled violently.

Although Xiao Sheng tried his best to maintain Rashomon, the ancient battleaxe was too terrifying. In the end, Rashomon was still split into two with a terrifying explosion.

“Bad news.”

Seeing this scene, everyone lost hope.

Xiao Sheng’s last technique had been broken.

And that battleaxe was still slashing toward Xiao Sheng.

Layers of terrifying light burst forth from Xiao Sheng’s body as if he wanted to block the ancient battleaxe.

At the same time, the terrifying vision hung behind Xiao Sheng also extended its palm to block the battleaxe.

“Boom!”

The axe landed on Xiao Sheng’s body, and the vision’s palm was instantly cut off. The light that had gathered on Xiao Sheng’s body was also easily torn apart like paper.

The battleaxe landed on Xiao Sheng’s body, sending him flying back hundreds of miles, and Xiao Sheng disappeared from everyone’s sight.

“Oh my…”

Countless people were in complete despair at this moment.

Meanwhile, Yuan Xiu sneered as he held his battleaxe.

“Is Xiao Sheng… dead?” Someone mumbled.

Even though no one wanted to believe it, the ancient battleaxe was still standing on Xiao Sheng’s body.

“Boom!”

At this moment, a ray of light suddenly condensed above Yuan Xiu.

The light was like a waterfall, incomparably thick as if it had been plucked from the sky, abrupt and terrifying.

“What?”

Yuan Xiu’s expression changed. He hurriedly grabbed his battleaxe and charged forward.

“Boom!”

But unfortunately, it was too late.

The light instantly engulfed Yuan Xiu and smashed him into the ground.

The battleaxe in his hand also disappeared.

A huge hole appeared on the ground. It was a ruin, and no one knew what had happened.

At the same time, Xiao Sheng dragged his injured body back to the battlefield.

His entire body was covered in blood now. His left arm had been cut off, and his body was on the verge of collapse.

Many white bones were exposed, looking terrifying.

At the same time, Xiao Sheng’s internal qi also started to become somewhat chaotic.

It was obvious that his condition had also reached its limit. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Ah!”

At that moment, Yuan Xiu burst out from the ruin.

He exuded a murderous aura, and the blood all over his body made him look like a demon.
