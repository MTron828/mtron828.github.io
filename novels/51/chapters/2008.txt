2009 Meeting Xiao Yu Again

However, Jue Wu didn’t seem to have considered that much. She was just proud of her “wise decision”.

“I promise you. I will definitely make the Si family pay the price,” Qin Yu bent his body and said seriously.

Jue Wu looked at Qin Yu in a daze. A moment later, she smiled and said, “What are you doing? Don’t disturb my meal.”

Qin Yu smiled. He did not continue the topic and slowly stood up.

!!

Qin Yu, who had mixed feelings, definitely could not fall asleep. Therefore, he walked out of the inn and planned to take a stroll around Five Mountain City.

At night, Five Mountain City was not as quiet as he had imagined. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Below the five mountains, people were still working hard and mining.

The people worked hard and heartily to exchange for a meager amount of spirit coins. They did not seem to have a high pursuit of cultivation but just wanted to live a stable life.

Qin Yu walked to the foot of the mountain. Looking at the people working hard, all sorts of feelings could not help but well up in his mind.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly sensed a trace of a strange internal qi approaching Five Mountain City.

Five Mountain City was not big, and Qin Yu’s divine sense could cover it completely. No one approaching could escape from Qin Yu’s divine sense.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said in a low voice, “Don’t tell me the Yao family is here?”

But soon, Qin Yu felt it unlikely because this internal qi was tremendously obscure and totally different from the Yao family.

The closer the internal qi was, the more Qin Yu frowned.

Qin Yu planned to find a place further away from the inn so that Jue Wu would not be implicated.

However, at this moment, Qin Yu noticed the internal qi did not seem to be approaching him but the inn instead.

“Hmm?” Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically.

He quickly guessed something!

The demonic egg!

Someone had their eyes on the demonic egg!

Without hesitation, Qin Yu turned into a golden light and flashed through the sky. Stepping on the line word formula, he rushed toward the inn!

Before he even reached the vicinity of the inn, Qin Yu had discovered five traces of strange behavior.

Five people in black robes stood quietly as if waiting for something.

Seeing Qin Yu barging in, the few people quickly looked toward him.

“Is the demonic egg with you?” one of them asked.

Qin Yu’s heart thumped.

These people were indeed here for the demonic egg!

“The demonic egg is with that person called Jue Wu. This kid is very close to Jue Wu,” another black-robed man suddenly spoke.

“It’s fine. Take him down and use him to exchange for the demonic egg,” another person said coldly.

Qin Yu coldly glanced at the few of them and could not help but sneer and said, “Just a few of you?”

These few people’s internal qis were tremendously obscure. Under Qin Yu’s prying eyes, their strength did not seem formidable. Thus Qin Yu was not worried in the slightest.

Therefore, he adjusted his internal qi and planned to fight these people.

But in the next second, Qin Yu’s expression changed.

It was because a black-robed man had suddenly appeared behind Qin Yu before he could make a move.

It was so fast that even Qin Yu could not react in time!

At this instant, Qin Yu only felt as if a knife was on his back, and he was as if being stared at by a wild beast. Cold sweat flowed down unconsciously!

“Go to hell!” In his panic, Qin Yu shouted, turned around, and threw a punch!

However, the other party casually raised his palm and grabbed Qin Yu’s fist.

Just this light touch made Qin Yu’s back turn cold!

Not only was his internal qi easily dissolved, but even the spiritual energy in his body was also flowing away!

“D*mn it!” Qin Yu wanted to withdraw his fist, but the other party’s palm had already grabbed his wrist firmly like an iron clamp. He could not move at all!

A few of them instantly looked at Qin Yu coldly as if they were looking at a clown.

“Who are you exactly?” Qin Yu exclaimed.

The other party ignored him and said coldly, “Using you to exchange for the demonic egg is not a loss.”

However, they did not move. Instead, they looked in a specific direction as if waiting for something.

The surroundings were silent. Other than Qin Yu’s struggle, there was no other movement.

Qin Yu was tremendously shocked in his heart at this moment. He could not figure out what kind of existence these people were!

With such terrifying strength, they were probably not much weaker than Yan Guyun!

“Whizz!”

A gust of eerie wind blew past at this moment, causing their clothes to flutter in the wind. The bone-chilling chill made them shiver uncontrollably.

At a glance, it was like a black hole with a bloody mouth open. It was extremely dark and made people shudder.

“He’s here.” At this moment, a black-robed man spoke coldly.

Hearing this, the black-robed man who captured Qin Yu immediately exerted more strength in his hand.

“Whizz..”

...

The wind blew even stronger now. The originally bright sky was now covered in dark clouds.

A large dark cloud slowly floated over from afar, covering the sky and the earth.

As the dark cloud covered the sky, a cultivator with a graceful figure slowly appeared.

She slowly walked out of the darkness as if unanimous with the dark cloud in the sky. It was incredibly magical.

The people present immediately became somewhat nervous. They seemed to have felt the extreme coldness from the other party’s body.

Qin Yu fixed his gaze on the figure that walked out from the darkness. However, in the dark, Qin Yu could not see clearly.

As she walked closer, she finally revealed her figure.

She had a graceful figure wearing a long white dress. The mask on her face flickered.

“Xiao… Xiao Yu!”

Qin Yu’s eyes widened! It was none other than Xiao Yu!

Compared to previously, the internal qi on Xiao Yu’s body had become even colder. It was incredibly icy!

...

Xiao Yu walked closer, step by step. The coldness increased with every step she took.

“Xiao Yu!” Qin Yu hurriedly shouted, but Xiao Yu ignored him and only looked at them coldly.

“Don’t move!” a black-robed man hurriedly shouted.

“I know this kid is an acquaintance of yours. I advise you to mind your own business. Otherwise, don’t blame us for being harsh!”

Xiao Yu looked at them coldly without saying a thing. No one could guess what she was thinking.

“I know someone has been watching the demonic egg, but you’ll kill him whenever someone gets close to it. That’s why we went ahead to catch this kid. I’d like to see what you’re going to do now!” a black-robed man sneered and said.

“That’s right. If you dare to come closer, we’ll kill this kid immediately!” another black-robed man said.

But at this moment, the black-robed man who spoke suddenly froze on the spot!

In the next second, his expression turned distorted, and his body kept trembling!

Before everyone could recover from their shock, the black-robed man’s body exploded and turned into a pool of blood mist!
