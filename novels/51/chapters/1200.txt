Chapter 1201: Chapter 1201, pure physical body 

When everyone saw this, they couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise!

As mighty figures, they naturally saw the strangeness of Qin Yu’s two punches!

“He... he relied on his physical body to break my spell!”That mighty figure couldn’t help but have some fear on his face!

“How can the physical body of this word be so terrifying! ?”

This was the first time Qin Yu relied purely on his physical body to fight, and the effect it brought was far beyond imagination.

Right now, Qin Yu’s body was like steel and iron, as if no spell could hurt him.

“Qin Yu, quickly stop the Sky Blood Rainbow...”

On the ground, ye Qing seemed to be doing his best to shout these words.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “Okay, I got it.”

After saying this, Qin Yu strode forward, as if he was strolling leisurely towards the Sky Blood Rainbow.

This attitude of acting as if there was no one else around instantly infuriated many mighty figures!

“You dare to ignore us? You’re courting death!”

For a moment, more than twenty mighty figures attacked one after another. The brilliance that filled the sky was like a torrential downpour as it headed straight for Qin Yu!

Qin Yu sneered. He raised both his arms and threw a punch with a bang!

This was clearly a punch from his physical body, but it caused an extremely powerful qi energy to be scraped!

Qi energy penetrated through the spell and instantly arrived in front of Tian Xuehong!

Tian Xuehong’s expression changed and he hurriedly shouted, “Stop him!”

Although he teng did not want to fight with Qin Yu, he could not be bothered with such a big plan. He immediately spat out a black light.

A large black hand suddenly appeared from the void and blocked in front of Tian Xuehong!

However, what was shocking was that the huge black hand was instantly dispersed and turned into black mist that disappeared without a trace!

“Bang!”

A terrifying qi energy smashed onto Tian Xuehong’s body.

Tian Xuehong was instantly smashed back repeatedly and he spat out blood continuously!

The spell that was about to be completed also stopped at this moment!

The expressions of everyone present were extremely complicated.

Other than shock, there was more confusion.

“Strange, this punch clearly doesn’t have the slightest spiritual energy fluctuation, but why does it have such a terrifying qi energy?”

“The fist didn’t even touch the sky blood rainbow, yet it forced it back. This... What kind of strange spell is this?”

“No! This isn’t a spell!”Bean-sized sweat flowed down he teng’s forehead. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Not a spell? What do you mean?”

He Teng said in a trembling voice, “This... This is just the wind from his fist!”

“Wind from his fist?”

At this moment, everyone gasped!

Just the wind from his fist was enough to break through He Teng’s spell?

Then what kind of power did his fist have? !

“Impossible, absolutely impossible!”A mighty figure shook his head desperately.

“No matter how strong this child is, his physical strength can’t possibly reach such a level! You must have misjudged him!”

“Watch me seal this child!”

A mighty figure took the initiative to attack. Two golden chains flew out from his sleeves.

The chains instantly arrived in front of Qin Yu and firmly bound him.

“This chain is formed from spatial secret arts. No one can... Break It!”

Before the Almighty could finish his words, his expression changed drastically!

His chain did not even last half a second before it was shattered by Qin Yu’s body!

He Teng’s expression was extremely ugly. He had been observing Qin Yu’s every move from the side.

From the moment Qin Yu descended to the moment he attacked, there was not a single trace of spiritual energy fluctuation.

In other words, Qin Yu was only relying on his body to fight!

“How could he suddenly grow to such a level...”he teng clenched his teeth, his heart filled with unwillingness!

Just relying on his physical body to crush a group of Heaven’s favorites, Heaven knew how terrifying he would be after using his spiritual energy!

At this moment, he teng even had the intention to retreat, planning to leave this troublesome place.

“Impossible, he absolutely can’t achieve such a level purely by relying on his physical body,”a mighty figure said coldly.

“We’ve lived for over a thousand years, but we’ve never seen such a physical body! It’s fake, it’s definitely fake!”

Just as this mighty figure finished speaking, Qin Yu had already shot over explosively!

With extremely fast speed, he arrived in front of him in the blink of an eye!

“HM?”

Before that mighty figure could react, Qin Yu had already thrown out two punches with loud bangs.

One punch landed on his chest, and the other on his head.

That mighty figure widened his eyes. Before he could even see clearly, his body had already fallen straight to the ground.

The powerful penetrating force passed through his head and directly shattered his primordial spirit.

Two punches, and a mighty figure had already fallen to the ground. No one dared to imagine it!

“Burn your essence blood. Otherwise, your fate will be the same as his,”Qin Yu swept his gaze across the mighty figures present and said indifferently.

“Everyone, quickly join forces and kill him!”Someone shouted in terror.

The rest of the people also came back to their senses at this moment. They quickly gathered together and formed a group.

At a glance, it really did seem like Qin Yu alone had surrounded more than twenty of them.

“Burning Silver Dragon Break!”

A mighty figure roared in anger as a spell closed in on Qin Yu.

This time, Qin Yu took the blow head-on. He tilted his body slightly and dodged it.

“Mysterious Heavenly Emperor Axe!”

A huge divine axe descended from the sky, as if it wanted to split the world in half!

“Purple Feather Imperial Spear!”

The spear light at the near end pierced through the void and instantly shot out hundreds of spears!

Every mighty figure no longer dared to conceal their strength. They all unleashed their trump cards and spells.

However, Qin Yu’s moves were incomparably simple. There were no flashy spells, only plain and unadorned fists.

Each of his punches seemed to contain an extremely powerful force. Coupled with his steel-like body, it was as if he was strolling leisurely among the many spells.

The spells that filled the sky had already shaken the scene into a mess. The mountain gate had collapsed, and the earth had sunk into oblivion.

Qin Yu passed through many strange spells and approached the few mighty figures.

With every step he took, the pressure became stronger.

“This kid seems to be unable to use his spiritual power!”Someone seemed to have noticed something!

“Everyone, don’t let him get close. No one can withstand a punch from him!”
