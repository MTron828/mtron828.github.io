Qin Yu had some doubts in his heart, but it wouldn’t take long for him to participate in the auction. Besides, he didn’t have much to lose, so Qin Yu agreed.

After entering the auction, Qin Yu took his number plate and found a place to sit down.

The entire auction was indeed packed with people. Many people seemed to want to get some opportunity to catch up with their fallen cultivation.

Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly. He spread out his divine sense and covered more than half of the auction.

Very soon, he sensed many powerful people.

Just as he was about to investigate further, his divine sense was suddenly cut off!

Before Qin Yu could come back to his senses, an ice-cold voice appeared in his mind. “Put away your divine sense. Don’t give yourself trouble.”

Qin Yu immediately frowned.

Using his divine sense to directly transmit his voice to him, such strength was absolutely terrifying!

Qin Yu followed the voice and looked not far away. He saw an extremely handsome young master with his eyes slightly closed.

And that voice seemed to be coming from his body.

There were not many people with such strength in the South Province, and there were even fewer people with such strength who were so young!

This was enough to prove that this young man probably did not come from the southern region!

Qin Yu retracted his divine sense and leaned back on his chair.

The arrival of such an expert meant that the woman was not lying.

There was probably some treasure that would appear in the auction today. As for whether or not it was the item from the ancient underworld that Satan mentioned, that was unknown.

Time passed by slowly. After a long time, the auction finally began.

The items up front were all very ordinary. Although they were also treasures, they were not rare enough. Hence, the atmosphere of the auction was a little cold.

Qin Yu’s eyes would occasionally look at the young man. He saw that the young man was the same as Qin Yu. He had no intention of making a move.

He closed his eyes slightly. He didn’t even have the intention to look at the young man.

“This person is probably here for the item of the ancient underworld,”Qin Yu thought to himself. He was afraid that Satan was here for the item of the ancient underworld.

After a long time, the auction had come to an end.

At this moment, someone on the stage walked up with a huge box.

The box looked extremely ancient, and it had traces of dust on it.

Other than that, one could feel traces of internal Qi on the box. The internal Qi was cold and chilling, causing one to shiver.

Qin Yu’s eyes stared at the box on the stage. He extended his divine sense, trying to sense something from it.

Unfortunately, Qin Yu’s divine sense could not penetrate the box.

Qin Yu did not give up. He tried to activate the desolate divine eye and a beam of light shot towards the box.

However, the result was still disappointing. Even the desolate god eye was unable to penetrate the box.

“This item is indeed extraordinary,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Following that, Qin Yu looked in the direction of the youth.

As expected, the youth opened his eyes and looked at the box.

His eyes emitted a greedy glow. Clearly, he had come here for the box.

Qin Yu did not know whether to be happy or sad. Since he had noticed the chest, it meant that it was indeed a treasure.

However, with Qin Yu’s strength, he was not his match. Even if he could get the chest, he might not be able to take it with him.

Maybe it’s not a treasure. It’s just that this chest is a little strange, Qin Yu thought to himself.

Soon, the host on the stage spoke.

He looked at the box in front of him and said, “I believe that everyone has heard of it. Rumor has it that this item originated from the ancient underworld of Satan. Of course, whether it’s real or fake still needs to be determined by everyone.”

“No need to talk nonsense. Open the box,”the young man said impatiently.

The host shook his head and said, “I’m sorry. The owner of this treasure said that this box can not be opened.”

“Not allowed?”The young man’s expression turned cold. With a light tap of his finger, the box immediately let out an explosive sound!

In the next second, the box was suddenly opened!

An extremely cold internal Qi instantly swept through the entire hall!

Under the young man’s powerful technique, the contents of the box actually floated straight into the air!

“You can’t do this, our auction…”

“Bang!”

Before the host could finish his words, the young man raised his finger, and his powerful internal Qi instantly sent the host flying!

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu immediately frowned.

It was called an auction, but this young man was no different from snatching!

“Since you’ve come to the auction, you must abide by the auction’s rules!”

“That’s right, are you trying to snatch something? Aren’t you going a little too far by doing this!”

“If you continue to do this, then don’t blame us for being impolite!”

Even the owner of the box hurriedly rushed up to the stage and looked at the young man with vigilance. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

However, the young man didn’t care at all. He swept his gaze across the crowd and then shouted angrily, “Do you all want to die! ?”

With an explosive shout, a terrifying internal Qi instantly erupted out. It was incomparably terrifying!

This young man had most likely already stepped into the reversion void stage!

Qin Yu frowned. He did not know the background of this young man, but he was certain that this person must have come from some great aristocratic family.

“Young master, the clan head has said before not to stir up trouble outside. It’s better to forget it. This thing is definitely ours.”At this moment, the old man beside him suddenly stood up and said.

After hearing these words, the young man restrained himself.

He snorted coldly and sat down again.

Seeing this, everyone couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief. However, the gazes they used to look at him became more vigilant.

The emcee had been injured by his finger, so he had no choice but to change the emcee at the last minute.

Since this box had already been opened, there was no need to keep it anymore. He simply picked up the thing inside and showed it to everyone.

Qin Yu glanced at it and saw that it was a token.

The token looked quite old and there were some strange characters engraved on it.

And at the center of the token, there were two lines of words.

The first line was written with the three words “Satan”.

As for the second line, it was a person’s name, Shen Tu.

When he saw the two words “Shen Tu”, Qin Yu immediately stood up and stared at the token!

To the holy region, the word ‘god Tut’might be unfamiliar, but to Qin Yu, it was extremely familiar!

On the other side of the starry sky, Qin Yu knew about the legend of God Tut.

Satan was indeed from the underworld, and he was even one of the Five Emperors of the underworld!

“Could it be that… this token really came from the ancient underworld…”Qin Yu was extremely shocked!

If Satan was really from the ancient underworld, then wouldn’t it be highly possible that the legends on Earth were true? !

At this moment, Qin Yu’s spatial magic artifact suddenly moved.

Qin Yu hurriedly sent out a strand of divine sense into the spatial magic artifact.

In the Spatial Magic Artifact, the venerable fifth mountain was shining!
