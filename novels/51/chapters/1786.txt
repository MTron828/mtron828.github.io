1787 A Terrifying Mental Addiction

This undoubtedly provided Qin Yu with a new way of cultivation, and the effect was extremely terrifying.

However, if this continued, Qin Yu would be completely reduced to become a villain.

Cultivation required dark energy. Now that he was devouring the primordial spirits of others, such a cultivation method was no different from that of a great evil person.

Seeing the silent Qin Yu, Jue Wu walked over and sat on his shoulder.

!!

“Don’t think too much. Since you’ve already made your choice, there’s nothing to regret,” Jue Wu comforted him and said.

Qin Yu glanced at Jue Wu, sighed, and said, “I’m afraid it’ll be even harder to restrain next time.”

Every time he devoured the primordial spirit, the greed in his heart would increase.

No one knew what Qin Yu would become in the end.

“It’s time to think of a way to restrain it,” thought Qin Yu.

Following that, Qin Yu and Jue Wu returned to God Bless Sect to see Yao Yingxuan.

Yao Yingxuan sat across from Qin Yu and said, “You’ve heard our conversation, right?”

“Yes.” Qin Yu nodded. “Senior, what are you going to do?”

Yao Yingxuan took a sip of tea and said, “I’ll take one step at a time. Please help pass a message to Xiao Sheng. Tell him that God Bless Sect absolutely has no intention of becoming his enemy.”

“Don’t worry. I’ll relay your words,” Qin Yu promised and said.

That day, Qin Yu left the East Continent after bidding goodbye to Yao Yingxuan.

He summoned the Divine Eagle and prepared to return to Nanzhou.

On the trip back to Nanzhou this time, besides bringing the news to Xiao Sheng, Qin Yu also planned to go to the brothel to ask Xiaoqian about it.

After a few days, Qin Yu and Jue Wu finally arrived at Tianyun Sect.

Standing at the entrance of Tianyuns Sect, Qin Yu’s mental addiction triggered again.

Qin Yu quickly activated Meridian Circulation Technique to restrain himself with all his might.

“Let’s go,” Jue Wu said.

“Mmm.” Qin Yu responded and followed Jue Wu to the Cultivation Mountain.

On the mountain, Qin Yu told Xiao Sheng everything that had happened.

However, Xiao Sheng was not too shocked after hearing it. He nodded slightly and said, “They’ve come to look for me.”

“So you already knew it?” Qin Yu frowned and asked.

“Yes.” Xiao Sheng did not seem to care much.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “They’ll be bringing Saint Weapon. I know you’re strong, but I’m afraid you don’t have any chance of winning against a Saint Weapon.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Yes.” Xiao Sheng couldn’t help but sigh.

“Then what do you plan to do?” Qin Yu looked at Xiao Sheng’s calm expression and couldn’t help but feel anxious for him.

“I don’t know,” Xiao Sheng shook his head.

Qin Yu was speechless for a moment.

“If there’s nothing you can do, you should also go to Thunder Courtyard,” Qin Yu said.

“No matter how powerful the Tong family is, they would never dare to break into Thunder Courtyard.”

“I don’t have that plan for the time being. Let’s take it one step at a time,” Xiao Sheng said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu could not help but get angry. He stood up and said, “This is a matter of life and death. Don’t you care at all?”

“Of course, I do care,” Xiao Sheng laughed and said.

“Anyway, you don’t have to worry about me. I have my own way.”

Although he said that, Qin Yu did not believe him at all.

Tianyun Sect was not a sect with a legacy, so they did not have a hidden force.

When faced with an aristocratic family like the Tong family, Tianyun Sect was not worth mentioning at all.

“Alright. Quickly go back to Thunder Courtyard.” Xiao Sheng waved his hand and directly ordered him to leave.

Qin Yu opened his mouth and wanted to say something, but he didn’t know what to say.

“This matter started because of me. I won’t watch you die,” Qin Yu said coldly.

After saying this, Qin Yu left Tianyun Sect with Jue Wu.

After that, the two of them went straight to the brothel in Dayue City City.

At the door of the brothel, Qin Yu looked at Jue Wu and said, “Wait for me outside. It’s not appropriate for you to enter this place.”

“How is it inappropriate? I also want to hug big girl!” Jue Wu said excitedly.

Qin Yu was speechless.

Left with no choice, Qin Yu could only bring Jue Wu in.

Not long after he entered the brothel, Jue Wu found a large group of beautiful women to accompany her.

Xiaoqian seemed to be busy at the moment, so Qin Yu had to wait in a room.

After about an hour.

The door was pushed open, and Xiao Qian walked in.

When she saw Qin Yu, she said in surprise, “What are you doing here?”

Qin Yu took a sip of water and said in a deep voice, “Do you know how to contact Sister Ning?”

“Of course, I know,” Xiaoqian said calmly.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “Please ask her out for me. I have something to see her.”

“It’s no use looking for her,” Xiaoqian said indifferently.

“No one can do anything about the cultivation technique you’ve learned. Once you start it, there’s no turning back. I remember telling you this very clearly.”

Qin Yu’s face was a little ugly. He said unwillingly, “If this continues, I won’t be able to restrain myself!”

“Why should you restrain yourself?” Xiaoqian laughed and said.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said, “Then wouldn’t I reduce to be a villain? Who knows what will happen in the future!”

“So what if you’re a villain? Why do you care so much? What? Do you want to be a great philanthropist?” Xiaoqian scoffed at him.

Qin Yu was a little angry, but he took a deep breath and suppressed it.

“So it means once I learn this technique, my mental addiction will grow without limit?” Qin Yu asked in a cold voice.

“Yes,” Xiaoqian said with a smile. “But the growth rate will gradually become slower. You don’t have to worry too much.

“Of course, if you really become a villain in the future, there’s also nothing to worry about.”

“Nonsense,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Regardless of becoming a villain or not, at least Qin Yu did not want to become a slave to this addiction. If he did, it would be equivalent to losing the autonomy of his body.

This was something Qin Yu absolutely could not accept.

“There’s always a way. It’s just that I don’t know what it is. Sister Ning doesn’t know either,” Xiao Qian changed the topic and said with a smile.

“I believe you can find a way. You can even endure the pain of your primordial spirit, let alone this mental addiction?”

“No,” Qin Yu shook his head and said. “I can bear the pain, but I can’t bear the inner demons.”

Inner demons were often the most terrifying. Once one was infected, they would accompany the person for life.

“There’s a way to everything. Go find it yourself,” Xiaoqian said with a smile.

At this point, she said with a vague smile, “You should be glad. Who knows how many people want to learn this Meridian Circulation Technique but are not qualified.”

After saying this, Xiaoqian turned around and left.

At this moment, Qin Yu had an impulse to rush up and devour Xiaoqian’s primordial spirit directly.

But in the end, Qin Yu held back.

“Even the curse of Nirvana Body could be resolved, what’s this mental addiction?” Qin Yu could only comfort himself in his heart.

The curse of the East Continent had not yet been resolved. And now he was infected with such a terrifying mental addiction. How could he not worry?
