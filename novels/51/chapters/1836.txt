1837 The Descent of the Path of Heaven

Thunder roared in the sky, and the immortal grave rumbled.

Qin Yu looked up at the long waited heavenly tribulation without any expression on his face.

This place was the immortal grave, and the heavenly tribulation had gathered above the grave. Qin Yu could not help having a thought.

The power of the Immortal Emperor was unimaginable, and he could even form his own dao technique. In the face of the heavenly tribulation, this immortal grave might be of some use.

Of course, this was just Qin Yu’s guess, and no one could be sure.

!!

Therefore, Qin Yu’s body emitted the Golden Light. He raised his head and stared at the heavenly tribulation, waiting for the first wave of the heavenly tribulation to descend.

“Boom! Boom! Boom…”

The moment the heavenly tribulation condensed, the immortal grave seemed to have sensed it.

The entire immortal grave rumbled as if heaven and earth were about to be torn apart. It was extremely terrifying!

Qin Yu fixed his gaze. He adjusted his internal qi to the extreme and displayed all his techniques to the extreme.

The golden radiance made him look like a god, and rays of dazzling Golden Light emitted from his body.

“Boom!”

At this time, the heavenly tribulation condensed together, and a terrifying internal qi smashed down fiercely!

This heavenly tribulation was terrifying to the extreme. It was incomparably huge as if it wanted to envelop the entire heaven and earth!

Qin Yu immediately condensed the internal qi in his body, preparing to withstand the heavenly tribulation!

However, at this moment, an extremely sharp and domineering internal qi suddenly emanated from the center of the world!

This internal qi was so overbearing that no one dared to look at it directly. a mere wisp of this internal qi would make people feel its insufferably arrogant pride on its body as if it was the only true master of this world!

The internal qi quickly welcomed the heavenly tribulation, and loud rumbles emitted from the immortal grave.

These rumbles were incomparably sacred. They outlined all the dao techniques in this world. At a glance, it seemed like a huge hand was stretching out from below, directly grabbing the heavenly tribulation.

“Boom!”

A terrifying sound spread out. The heavenly tribulation was directly crushed!

However, the internal qi exuded from the immortal grave did not dissipate. Instead, it went straight into the sky.

It seemed to be telling the heavenly tribulation who the true master of this world was!

“Actually… It really could!” Qin Yu’s face was full of shock. Even though he had already guessed the outcome, he was still extremely shocked when it happened in front of him!

It was just an empty void, but it was as if a god-like figure was standing there, confronting the sky!

Qin Yu only felt extremely shocked!

Was this the power of the Immortal Emperor? Even though he had fallen many years ago, he still had the demeanor of confronting heaven and earth!

All the dao techniques and laws seemed to be unable to restrain him. Even if everything disappeared, the dao techniques he left behind were still extremely overbearing!

In front of this immortal grave, Qin Yu felt as small as a speck of dust, not even qualified to look up!

The sky was still rumbling. It seemed like the collision of two dao techniques and not two substantial people.

After a long time, the second wave of heavenly tribulation still didn’t descend from the sky. Instead, it seemed to have been defeated by the Immortal Emperor’s dao technique.

However, it was the Path of Heaven after all, which was formed by combining the doa techniques of countless people. It was not something that a single person could be compared to.

Finally, the dark clouds began to retreat and gathered above Qin Yu’s head.

It stunned Qin Yu, and he couldn’t help but curse.

“F*ck you! I’m doomed!” Qin Yu could not help but curse.

The heavenly tribulation seemed to have wanted to swallow Qin Yu. It kept rolling toward his direction.

The terrifying pressure made Qin Yu tremble all over. His legs were so weak that he felt like he was going to kneel on the ground!

“If I had known this earlier… I would have left this place first…” Qin Yu could not help but curse in his heart.

However, at this moment, it was useless to say anything. He could only withstand it.

“Buzz!”

Right at this moment, the dark clouds above him disappeared, and everything returned to normal.

Before Qin Yu could turn around, he felt his vision go black.

When he opened his eyes again, he felt like he had been pulled into another space.

“Eh?” Qin Yu was stunned.

He lowered his head to look at his body and was shocked to find that it was his primordial spirit!

“I can’t be… undergoing the tribulation in my primordial spirit, can I?” Qin Yu suddenly had a bad feeling.

To transcend the tribulation with the primordial spirit was to transcend the tribulation in the illusionary realm in other words.

However, this illusion was not a technique but a dao technique of the Path of Heaven.

If he failed to transcend the tribulation, his soul would still be destroyed!

“Rumble…”

Soon, the heavenly tribulation began to gather in Qin Yu’s vision again.

The extremely huge heavenly tribulation smashed toward Qin Yu.

Qin Yu was caught off guard and was directly smashed onto the ground.

It was intense pain!

This heavenly tribulation seemed to have smashed onto the primordial spirit. The pain was unbearable, and the pain of the physical body could not compare to it!

“F*ck! It was for real!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse.

In this way, Qin Yu’s physical advantage would no longer exist!

From the outside, Qin Yu was merely sitting cross-legged with his eyes slightly closed.

However, when the heavenly tribulation descended on Qin Yu’s surroundings, cracks still appeared on his physical body. And blood was flowing.

“If that’s the case, it’s fortunate that I devoured the primordial spirits. Otherwise, I would have died without a doubt.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

He stood up from the ground. His golden primordial spirit was no different from his physical body.

Such a heavenly tribulation was extremely terrifying and unfortunate.

However, Qin Yu had no other way out.

He tried to mobilize the spiritual power in his body to prepare for the heavenly tribulation.

“Boom!”

The second wave of heavenly tribulation smashed down. Qin Yu clenched his fist and rose, and his golden fist received the heavenly tribulation head-on!

At this moment, Qin Yu’s primordial spirit was in so much pain that he was trembling.

However, he gritted his teeth and tried his best to rush up. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Boom!”

The third wave of heavenly tribulation also descended at this moment!

Qin Yu, who was initially able to resist, was directly smashed to the ground!

His primordial spirit emitted wisps of internal qi in black. It was as if it wanted to tear his primordial spirit apart.

Looking from the outside, Qin Yu’s body was constantly bleeding, and his body was shaking violently.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and stood up again.

Qin Yu’s primordial spirit had also become extremely powerful now. After obtaining the cultivation technique of Satan, Qin Yu’s primordial spirit was by no means others in the same realm could compare to.

The fourth wave, the fifth wave, and the sixth wave of heavenly tribulations descended at the same time.

Qin Yu had no choice but to withstand them.

After withstanding the three waves of heavenly tribulations, Qin Yu’s primordial spirit had become a little dimmer.

Then, the seventh wave and the eighth wave!

These two waves of heavenly tribulations were not as terrifying as he had imagined. On the contrary, they were rather gentle, allowing Qin Yu to withstand them easily.

“Strange.” Qin Yu frowned.

He raised his head and stared at the sky, waiting for the ninth wave of heavenly tribulation to descend.
