Chapter 769: How Shameless! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Their eyes were filled with terror! Their bodies were trembling slightly!

In a short moment, the terror on their faces grew stronger!

In the next second, the Guardians walked over!

When the surrounding people saw this, they were so frightened that they scattered in all directions and cried out repeatedly!

However, the Guardians came directly in front of Xiao Yu.

Immediately after, the two Guardians actually knelt in front of Xiao Yu with a plop!

Their bodies could be seen trembling, and their heads drooped down in extreme terror!

When everyone saw this scene, they couldn’t help but gulp.

What was going on?! How could two incomparably powerful Guardians kneel in front of this little girl?!

Qin Yu couldn’t help but reveal a shocked expression.

“It really is as you said.” Qin Yu glanced at the man with the mustache and said in a low voice.

The man with the mustache spread his hands and muttered, “I actually forgot about her...”

At this moment, Xiao Yu’s gaze was somewhat sluggish.

She looked at the two Guardians kneeling in front of her and didn’t speak for a long time.

A moment later, Xiao Yu raised her palm and placed it on their foreheads.

It was at this moment that the two guardians lost their divine senses and fell back to the ground, becoming two corpses.

“What the hell is going on?” The surrounding people were still in a state of confusion.

Yan Jinyao stepped forward and pointed at Qin Yu. “Qin Yu, who exactly is this little girl? Also, what’s going on with those two corpses?!”

Qin Yu sneered. “Does it have anything to do with you?”

Yan Jinyao narrowed his eyes and sneered. “Don’t worry, the truth will eventually come out. This matter will soon be spread! The Jingdu Martial Arts Association will definitely not idly sit by!”

Hearing this, Qin Yu immediately felt that something was wrong.

Just as Yan Jinyao said, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association would definitely not idly sit by after such a thing had happened.

“I’m afraid I really won’t be able to keep this secret.” Qin Yu glanced at Xiao Yu, his eyes filled with worry.

“Let’s go.” Qin Yu didn’t think much about this matter.

He put away the two corpses, pulled Xiao Yu along, and turned his head to leave.

The people around didn’t dare to stop him, and made way for him one after another.

They hurried all the way back to the martial arts academy.

Qin Yu squatted in front of Xiao Yu and asked with a frown, “Xiao Yu, do you feel any discomfort?”

Xiao Yu shook her head and said, “No, I don’t know what happened just now. It was like... I suddenly lost consciousness.”

Qin Yu glanced at the man with the mustache and then said with a smile, “You have made a great contribution today. If it weren’t for you, I’m afraid that blood would flow like a river today.”

The man with the mustache muttered to the side, “I’m afraid that she’ll be even more terrifying in the future.”

“Shut up!” Qin Yu glared at the man with the mustache.

...

After experiencing this great battle, Qin Yu’s body was extremely tired.

“Nan with the mustache, take good care of Xiao Yu. Don’t let anyone take her away,” Qin Yu warned.

The man with the mustache nodded and said, “Don’t worry.”

Qin Yu grunted and turned back to his room before falling into a deep sleep.

At this time, the news of the Guardians spread like wildfire.

Not only did it spread on the Martial Arts Forum, but it also spread throughout the entire martial arts world.

Granny Qin’s body almost shattered and she fell into a coma. It was likely that she wouldn’t wake up for a while.

Blackie was even worse off. The transformation pill was ineffective, and he had once again turned into a Heaven Swallowing Python.

Just as Qin Yu was in a deep sleep...

Yan Jinyao suddenly brought his disciples over to pay him a visit.

The door of the manor was kicked open and Yan Jinyao swaggered in with his two disciples.

“Where’s Qin Yu?! I want to fight him!” A youth stepped forward and berated loudly.

The man with the mustache couldn’t help but curse, “Are you shameless? Qin Yu is currently in a deep sleep and has no time to deal with you. Get lost!”

The youth sneered. “What? Qin Yu wants to be a coward?! Fine, if he doesn’t dare to, then I’ll leave!”

“You’re really shameless. How about I fight you?!” The man with the mustache rolled up his sleeves and said.

“Oh yeah? What does it have to do with you? Are you planning to bully the weak?” At this time, Yan Jinyao stood out.

Seeing this, the man with the mustache quickly withdrew.

He muttered in a low voice, “Young Master Yan, you can’t be so thick-skinned...”

“Who are you talking about?!” Yan Jinyao’s disciple immediately shouted.

The man with the mustache hurriedly took two steps back and said with an embarrassed smile, “Why don’t you guys wait? Qin Yu will wake up very soon...”

“Wait? Hahaha! Why? Is Qin Yu so cautious when fighting with my disciple?” Yan Jinyao ridiculed.

At this moment, Xiao Yu suddenly stood up.

“I’ll fight with you,” she said to the young man.

Yan Jinyao frowned slightly when he saw Xiao Yu.

He saw the two Guardians kneeling in front of Xiao Yu with his own eyes. Moreover, he was sent flying by Xiao Yu last time.

“We’re looking for Qin Yu. It has nothing to do with you,” Yan Jinyao said coldly.

Xiao Yu said, “I’m Qin Yu’s disciple. It’s only fair for disciples to fight.”

Yan Jinyao opened his mouth. Just as he was about to speak, Xiao Yu beat him to it. “What’s the matter, Yan Jinyao? Are you afraid?”

“Master, I’ll fight with her. She’s just a little brat!” Yan Jinyao’s disciple rolled up his sleeves and said.

Yan Jinyao released his internal qi and tried to sense Xiao Yu’s internal qi.

Soon, he discovered Xiao Yu’s strength.

“A new Martial Marquis?” Yan Jinyao raised his eyebrows and revealed a cold smile.

His disciple was in the middle stage of the Martial Marquis Realm!

Every small realm of the Martial Marquis realm was extremely different! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Moreover, it was such a big difference in realm!

“Okay!” Yan Jinyao took a step back.

“If we win, it will prove that Qin Yu’s disciples are not good enough,” Yan Jinyao said indifferently.

After saying that, he waved his hand and ordered someone to record the video.

Yan Jinyao’s purpose was very simple. It was to expand his power.

“Master, don’t worry. I...”

“Boom!”

Before the young man could finish his words, Xiao Yu had already punched out!

The seemingly ordinary punch directly shattered the young man’s head!

The young man didn’t even have time to react before his head and divine sense were directly shattered!

“It’s over!” Xiao Yu clapped his hands and turned to leave.

Everyone was dumbstruck and subconsciously looked at Yan Jinyao.

Yan Jinyao naturally couldn’t hold it in any longer. He shouted, “Stop right there!”

“What?” Xiao Yu stopped in her tracks.

Yan Jinyao narrowed his eyes and said, “It’s just a friendly spar, yet you killed him! You’re so vicious at such a young age, I can’t let you live!”

“Young Master Yan, aren’t you going too far?” The man with the mustache hurriedly jumped out.

Yan Jinyao said coldly, “It has nothing to do with you. Get lost!”

After saying that, Yan Jinyao stretched out his palm and grabbed at Xiao Yu again!

This time, Yan Jinyao contained extremely strong power. It was obvious that he intended to kill Xiao Yu with one strike!

At this moment, a golden light burst out from the room!

Then, a golden figure held a golden fist and faced Yan Jinyao head-on!

“Boom!”

At the moment of the collision, Yan Jinyao immediately took two steps back.

He suddenly raised his head and saw Qin Yu standing in front of Xiao Yu.

“What? Are you bullying people? Yan Jinyao, you’re really shameless,” Qin Yu said coldly.
