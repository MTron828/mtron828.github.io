Chapter 2425: The Power of Kingship

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Qin Yu, now that you have the corpse of the Immortal Emperor as your bodyguard, you can probably do whatever you want in the Holy Region. I really don’t know how you did it. It’s simply ridiculous!” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Jiang He’s face was full of disbelief.

The corpse of the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor was the Yao family’s treasure.

Which Immortal Emperor could seal himself in his corpse forever and be unable to reincarnate to protect his family?

This Yao family’s celestial artifact was reputable. It had killed countless cultivators who had invaded the Yao family. Its reputation was comparable to the Divine Destiny Pagoda.

But he did not know what method Qin Yu had used to let him recover a trace of his soul.

“The Yao family’s ancestor left behind his corpse and sealed his remaining soul in his body just to protect the Yao family. However, for thousands of years, many cultivators of the Yao family have forgotten its details and used it as a magical artifact. They spent a lot of time communicating with his soul.”

Yao Meng said softly. The sea of the Path of Heaven gently surged and emitted a soft sound. The qi of the Path of Heaven slowly condensed in her hand, and a golden kingship internal qi appeared on her hand.

In an instant, many wandering remnant souls in the void approached this trace of kingship aura, voluntarily becoming a part of its power.

“The rules the Yao family bloodline and the immortal scriptures comprehended seem to be the power of kingship. Using this power to communicate with the corpse of the Yao family’s Celestial Saint is indeed underutilizing its abilities. The power you used just now had even defeated the Yao family’s Immortal

Emperor at the higher rank. This is also why you can get the Immortal Emperor’s corpse’s recognition.”

Jiang He stared at the power of the way and exclaimed. At such a close distance, he could discover its profundity even more.

Yao Meng was indeed the number one genius on Earth back then. She indeed walked a different cultivation path from the Yao family.

And to be able to gain recognition by the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor meant that the Immortal Emperor’s remnant soul recognized Yao Meng’s cultivation method.

The three chatted about the past. Then, Yao Meng and Jiang He were about to leave.

“Qin Yu, Yao Meng. Let’s exchange our communication jade slips and keep in touch. According to the information the Jiang family has received, I’m afraid the future won’t be peaceful.”

Jiang He took out two jade slips and handed them to them.

He did have some information now, but because it involved family secrets, he could not tell Qin Yu and Yao Meng clearly. He could only vaguely remind them.

“Alright, I’ll see you two brothers again.”

Yao Meng did not waste time and directly left with Jiang He.

All of a sudden, a massive spatial fluctuation was emitted from Ethereal Peak. It seemed to be the internal qi of the teleportation formation opening.

“Senior Brother Qin Yu, Dean Lei and Flower Granny requested you to go to Ethereal Peak now.”

The junior brother of Ethereal Peak requested someone to inform him at the door.

“Alright, I’ll be there immediately.”

Qin Yu nodded. The people from Thunder Courtyard in retreat outside seemed to have returned. Qin Yu did not know what level they were at. He was a little curious. Thunder Courtyard was as famous as the nine great aristocratic families. He wondered what the ancestors stationed outside were like. Soon, Qin Yu sensed that many people had been waiting for him at Ethereal Peak.

Upon closer inspection, the peak masters of the five peaks and the various higher-ups had all appeared.

Jue Wu and Chang Mang also went to see the show early in the morning.

“Qin Yu, you’re here.”

Lei Xin said with a smile. He seemed to be in a good mood.

The return of the ancestors of Thunder Courtyard had also allowed him to heave a sigh of relief.

The teleportation formation emitted a vast amount of spatial qi. It seemed to have connected to another location incredibly far away.

At this moment, the two coordinates connected into a spatial passageway, transporting the person on the opposite side over.

“Dean Lei, are many seniors of Thunder Courtyard returning?”

Qin Yu felt the massive internal qi emitted from the teleportation formation. The people who came this time must be tremendously powerful.

“That’s right. The planar suppression of the alien races in purgatory has been reduced by more than half. Various powerful alien races have appeared in purgatory at any time to hunt humans. In the past half year, the human race has suffered heavy losses. Now, there are only a few safe strongholds left. The Holy Region is considering sending an announcement to bring back the powerful human race in purgatory. They will use the Holy Region as their last stronghold to defend.”

Lei Xin frowned. This information was indeed very sensitive.

In the past Path of Heaven years, this had only happened once. The situation seemed to be more troublesome than everyone had imagined.

The internal qi of the teleportation formation had been circulating for a very long time. After nearly six hours, nearly 20 people suddenly appeared in the teleportation formation.

These people were emitting a sky-soaring blood aura. It was the internal qi that could only be cultivated after a long period of life-and-death battles. “We respectfully welcome the return of our senior ancestors!”

As that figure appeared, everyone from Thunder Courtyard bowed and said in unison.

A group of people walked out slowly and silently. The three people in the lead walked out slowly.

These three people were the most senior in Thunder Courtyard. The people behind them waited at the back respectfully.

In the middle was a white-haired and long-browed elderly man. He had a dignified face, and his face was covered in wrinkles like dried bark as if telling people his seniority. This person was the most senior Supreme Elder of Thunder Courtyard, Lei Qingye.

On his right was a middle-aged man who looked much younger. His face was as sinister as an eagle’s, and it was obvious that he was a decisive person. This person was also slightly younger than Lei Qingye, and his name was Lei Huan.

On the left was a middle-aged woman with a genial look. Her long hair was coiled up into a ball like a Taoist priest. She looked fairly simple and capable. This woman was also an ancestor of Flower Peak. Her name was Hua Qianjie.

A young man with an unruly expression was beside her. He did not look old, probably about the same age as Qin Yu.

Lei Xin introduced them to Jue Wu, and Jue Wu recognized the three of them. She immediately told Qin Yu about the information of the people in front of her.

“Lei Xin, is this the strongest fighting strength in Thunder Courtyard? Golden Age has opened for nearly a year, and only you and Xiaohua have reached the second level of the Soul Statue. You can probably reach the third or fourth level if you have accumulated sufficiently, right?”

Lei Qingye frowned deeply as if he was extremely dissatisfied with the current fighting strength of Thunder Courtyard.

“Martial Uncle Qingye, the Golden Age has only descended for a short period.

Being able to reach this realm is already the limit of mine and Xiaohua’s.

Moreover, the current Path of Heaven cultivators in the Holy Region at the Tribulation Second Level Soul Statue are already at their peak.”

Lei Xin forced a bitter smile. In front of Qingye, his and Granny Flower’s talents were like children’s, unable to earn any respect.

However, he was qualified to say such things. Two Path of Heaven years ago, Lei Qingye was born, and in less than a hundred years, he had reached the Peak of True Saint.

After the Golden Age descended, he broke through in a day, entered the power of the Soul Statue in a month, and condensed the power of Tribulation Fourth Level Condensed Throne in a year. He had no idea of the level his current cultivation had reached.

This kind of talent was something that even Lei Xin wanted to look up to..
