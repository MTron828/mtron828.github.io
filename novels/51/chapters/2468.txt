2469 Six Acupoints

Very soon, Qin Yu’s body seemed to have become a fatty.

Even though his Northern Underworld Demonic Technique had stopped circulating, the monster race’s energy of the crystal wall was like a coiling snake.

It surrounded his body, and in an instant, a massive amount of demonic elemental energy suddenly entered. It seemed to have sensed Qin Yu’s unfriendly intentions and wanted to make him explode alive straight away.

Qin Yu’s expression instantly changed drastically. Furthermore, the energy that had entered his body had set up a barrier on the surface of his body, preventing the energy from flowing out of his body.

In other words, at this moment, he could only passively endure the demonic elemental energy being transmitted, but he could not transfer it to other places at all.

In an instant, Qin Yu’s facial features twisted, and the blood vessels on the surface of her body almost burst.

However, not a single drop of blood flowed out, and he was as if being locked in a bright red container!

The cosmic form!

Qin Yu’s body swelled up, but that massive amount of the demonic elemental energy was still endlessly entering his body.

Lei Xin and Flower Granny also immediately realized something was wrong. Lei Xin pointed his finger at the crystal wall and wanted to pierce through it.

However, unexpectedly, he could not break through despite using all his strength.

“We’re in trouble. This power of the Path of Heaven is a high-level energy. It can derive its own consciousness and automatically attack intruders.”

Lei Xin was tremendously anxious, but it seemed that he could do nothing.

Within the energy wall, Qin Yu’s body exploded into balls of blood mist.

In the face of such an explosive energy impact, even his Glazed Holy Body was as fragile as an eggshell.

At this moment of crisis, Qin Yu no longer cared about his body’s condition.

He focused all of his attention on his inner body. The meridians and muscles in his body were connected, and the cells were constantly undergoing the process of death and rebirth.

After the cells gathered, they formed new blood vessels, muscles, and meridians, and his body was like a sky full of stars.

Qin Yu closed his eyes and could sense the energy fluctuations of varying strengths.

“Qin Yu!”

The blood-red mist covered Qin Yu’s whole body.

Finally, when his consciousness became slightly blurry, Qin Yu sensed four massive masses of energy.

They were the four acupuncture points he had opened up, releasing an enormous space fluctuation.

This fluctuation was somewhat similar to the spatial fluctuation of the Sumeru ring.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth tightly, and the power of the soul instantly swam in his body. Finally, he found two acupoints on his left and right that had similar fluctuations to each other.

The Shaofu acupoints on his left and right palms!

“Boom!”

Along with an intense tearing sensation, the ocean-like demonic qi frantically rushed into his acupoints.

In an instant, this acupoint was opened by the terrifying demonic qi, and a vast amount of the demonic elemental energy instantly filled the entire acupoint.

After that, under Qin Yu’s control, the vast energy again rushed through the Shaofu acupoint on his right hand.

Six acupoints!

The Vitality Gate acupoint!

The Yintang acupoint!

The left and right Yongquan acupoints!

The Shaofu acupoints on the left and right!

Qin Yu’s body emitted a sound like beans rolling on the ground. His six acupoints suddenly emanated a blue light.

In an instant, Qin Yu seemed to have felt six tremendous sources of power appearing in his body, and he could draw in shocking energy with a single breath.

A terrifying aura emanated from his body, lifting him directly.

In an instant, Lei Xin, Flower Granny, and the others felt a chill run down their spines. It was as if they were facing a Primordial Chaos monster.

Northern Underworld Demonic Technique!

Qin Yu’s eyes revealed a scarlet light as he slapped his palm at the energy crystal wall.

The remaining demonic elemental energy instantly surged into his body, and numerous new meridians appeared in his six acupoints instantly.

The six acupoints were linked together instantly, and the power within moved freely with a thought.

With a thought, Qin Yu even utilized this gathered power and the terrifying strength to increase the space in his acupoints to grow again.

The seal shattered, and Qin Yu retracted the power he had released into his body. His entire body slowly landed on the ground.

The moment he landed, the ground suddenly exploded.

“Are you alright, Qin Yu?”

Chang Mang asked somewhat nervously.

Everything happened too fast, from when he started absorbing the demonic elemental energy to when he encountered danger.

After that, he opened two more acupoints. All of this happened in a flash. He did not expect so many things to happen in such a short time.

“I’m fine. It’s a blessing in disguise!”

Qin Yu briefly explained what had happened to everyone.

Only then did everyone feel tremendously shocked. They did not expect it to be so dangerous just now.

“After the six acupoints are formed, your physical strength will increase significantly. From the power you released just now, I can see that your physical strength should be between the Tribulation Third Level and the Fourth Level.” Lei Xin also engaged in the cultivation of the physical body. The rules of thunder were used together with the physical body, so he could roughly analyze the explosive power of Qin Yu’s physical body.

“Pretty much. However, the advancement for now isn’t as great as I imagined. I need a suitable combination of cultivation methods.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said.

When one reached the Tribulation Transcending Stage, most human race cultivators would activate the power of the Path of Heaven using the soul. Very few would primarily focus on physical cultivation except the cultivators with special souls.

This kind of cultivator’s soul was special, and it was very difficult for him to sense the power of the Path of Heaven. Thus, he could only cultivate in this way, which was somewhat similar to the cultivation method of the monster race.

But to Qin Yu, who has a powerful soul, it was not very useful.

His maximum strength could reach between the Tribulation Fourth Level and Tribulation Fifth Level and would increase slightly with his physical strength.

But it was not as simple as 1+1, and it was more about small-scale incremental improvements.

Therefore, Qin Yu rarely spent his time cultivating his physical body. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

He did not expect that this time, the acupoints on his body, to save his life.

“This fusion of god and physical body might not be as simple as I imagined. Perhaps I can give it a try in the future.”

Qin Yu quietly analyzed.

“Alright, now that the seal has broken, let’s go in. Judging from the internal qi emitted from this passageway, the other side should still be the human race continent. I just don’t know why the monster race spent so much effort setting up all this.”

Lei Xin said to the crowd after carefully sensing the surroundings.

“Yes, there was the power of the sacrifice just now. There must be the monster race here. We must be more careful after we enter.” Flower Granny instructed everyone before entering the passageway.
