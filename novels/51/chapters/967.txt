Chapter 968: Chapter 968, the clash of spiritual senses

The Sky Blood Rainbow planned out a large area of land.

This area of land had the most warriors.

He spent several days to set up a formation around this area of land.

And this formation was the top technique of the immortal slaying sect, a technique that could absorb people’s spiritual senses!

Back then, the immortal slaying sect had relied on this technique to carry forward their sect and become the number one sect in the world!

Now, Tian Xuehong was going to use the same trick again, intending to absorb the spiritual sense of others for his own use!

Near the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, there was a huge empty space.

This empty space was called the martial arts discussion hall, and it was once used by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association as a place for all the martial artists in the world to compete.

And ever since Granny Qin died, the martial arts discussion hall had been completely abandoned. It had been a long time since anyone had used it.

Today, Tian Xuehong stood near the martial arts school, planning to use the land again.

He looked at Gu Xinghe beside him and said indifferently, “I want you to issue an announcement to invite all the martial artists in the world to come over for a gathering.”

Gu Xinghe frowned slightly and said with a cold face, “Are you ordering me?”

Tian Xuehong’s pupils suddenly emitted a dark red color!

He suddenly stretched out his hand and grabbed Gu Xinghe’s neck, lifting him up into the air.

“You can understand it this way,”Tian Xuehong said coldly.

The two martial saints beside Gu Xinghe hurriedly moved forward, trying to make a move.

But at this moment, two white bones blocked in front of him!

“If you don’t want to die, then get lost to the side,”Tian Xuehong said coldly.

The two martial saints’expressions instantly changed, and they could not help but retreat.

Soon after, Tian Xuehong released Gu Xinghe and said with his hands behind his back, “Go, do as I say.”

Gu Xinghe gritted his teeth. Tian Xuehong’s attitude was getting more and more arrogant, and Gu Xinghe could no longer sit on the same level as him.

This also reminded Gu Xinghe of what Zhai Xing had said.

“Can I know what you want to Do?”Gu Xinghe said with a sullen face.

Tian Xuehong said indifferently, “You don’t have the right to know.”

Gu Xinghe’s pupils constricted again!

Although he wanted to get angry, he forcefully suppressed it when he saw the white bones beside Tian Xuehong.

Then, Gu Xinghe turned around and left. He unwillingly followed Tian Xuehong’s request and sent out the invitation.

Once the invitation was sent out, many martial artists received the news.

The time was set for three days later. Although he didn’t say what it was, Gu Xinghe exaggerated the importance of this matter in his statement.

When many martial artists heard this, they all planned to come and participate.

Qin Yu, who was sitting in the hotel, naturally saw this news.

“A talk at the Martial Arts Hall? Martial artists of the World?”Qin Yu frowned slightly.

He touched his chin and muttered, “What is this Gu Xinghe up to this time?”

Looking at the guesses of the people on the martial arts forum, Qin Yu frowned more and more.

His intuition told him that this matter was not that simple.

“To be safe, it’s best to tame that guy under the Abyss in these three days,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

During this period of time, Qin Yu’s spiritual sense had increased explosively, and he already had the qualifications to speak with him.

Thus, Qin Yu didn’t waste any time. He immediately entered the spatial artifact and directly came under the abyss.

That thread of light was still in silence, and it didn’t have the slightest reaction to Qin Yu’s arrival.

Qin Yu played with the spirit stone in his hand, then threw it towards that thread of light.

The moment the spirit stone collided, it instantly turned into nothingness.

Such speed, even Qin Yu was dumbfounded.

“I’ll make a deal with you.”Qin Yu stood beside him and said with a smile.

“Deal my ass, get lost!”The light cursed without thinking.

Qin Yu smiled embarrassedly and said, “What are you doing? I haven’t said anything yet, why are you so anxious?”

“F * ck you. You Fool me every day. Do you think I will fall for it?”The other party said angrily. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Qin Yu touched his chin and said, “This time I’m serious. I have a bad feeling. I’m afraid I need your help.”

“It’s none of my business.”The other party refused without thinking.

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “How about this? I’ll give you a thousand spirit stones and agree to your request. What do you think?”

Hearing this, the light finally had a reaction.

“Are you serious?”He said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “But I have a request.”

After saying this, Qin Yu stretched out his palm, and a halo appeared in his palm.

This halo was created by Qin Yu with a trace of his own spiritual sense. He used the legacy spell left behind by his father to create the spiritual sense confinement spell.

“This item is called the silver hoop charm. If you are willing to wear it, I can consider your request,”Qin Yu said.

“Silver hoop charm?”That sliver of light was immediately somewhat displeased.

“You don’t believe me?”

Qin Yu said with a smile, “I believe you? Unless I’m an idiot.”

“I don’t want to wear this thing,”that sliver of light humphed.

Although he said so, he was happy deep down in his heart!

Silver Hoop Curse? What a few things. You want to trap me with just this thing?

Once I get out of this Abyss and enter your body, I can easily tear this silver hoop curse apart!

When that time comes, not only will I swallow your spiritual sense, but I will also take over your body!

Qin Yu did not know what he was thinking, so he said patiently, “I have to at least guarantee my own safety, right? Your broken spiritual sense is in my body. What If you harm me?”

The Ray of light pretended to be unwilling and said, “Forget it. For My Freedom, I’ll agree to it.”

“That’s more like it,”Qin Yu muttered.

He picked up the silver hoop curse and walked toward the ray of light.

Then, Qin Yu fastened the silver hoop curse onto his spiritual sense.

The moment it was fastened, it immediately flashed with a strange light.

The light disappeared and directly entered the light.

“This is the silver hoop spell? This kind of thing wants to trap me?”The light couldn’t help but sneer in his heart.

“As long as you dare to let me escape from the Abyss, I promise to swallow you until there is nothing left!”

Although he thought so in his heart, he still snorted lightly. “It’s not easy to get out of the abyss, but in the end, you have to wear some silver hoop spell. Damn it, damn it!”
