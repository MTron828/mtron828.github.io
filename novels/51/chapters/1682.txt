Chapter 1683: Chapter 1,683, get out of the divine capital! 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

It had been a long time since they had seen the legendary golden age!

“There will only be more breakthroughs,”Xiao Sheng said coldly.

The deputy sect master asked, “Sect master, do I need to send people to record them down?”

Xiao Sheng glanced at him and shook his head, “There’s no need.”

“Then shouldn’t we have some countermeasures?”The deputy sect master continued. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Xiao Sheng, however, remained silent and only smiled coldly.

He did not say anything and turned around to walk up the Cultivation Mountain.

After taking a few steps forward, Xiao Sheng stopped and said, “If Qin Yu comes to find me, remember to have him wait for me here.”

The deputy sect master hurriedly nodded and said, “Yes, sect master.”

Xiao Sheng’s face had an extremely playful smile. No one could see through what he was thinking.

In the following time, just as the sect master had said, more and more people broke through.

Many of them were stuck at a certain realm and could not advance. However, under the golden great world, they had successfully broken through.

At the same time, Qin Yu was still taking the dragon blood.

Under the nourishment of the dragon blood, he stepped into the middle stage of the Almighty Realm as expected.

His physical body did not improve at all. However, the breakthrough in his realm brought a qualitative breakthrough to his spiritual power.

In the following period of time, Qin Yu was still taking the dragon blood. However, the result was a little unfortunate. No matter how much dragon blood he took, his realm could not advance even half a step further.

Qin Yu opened his eyes. He looked at the dragon blood jar placed in front of him and could not help but sigh.

“Even if it’s dragon blood, it won’t do,”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

Qin Yu’s special physique required his body to reach a balance between yin and yang.

And the uniqueness of this physique could not be changed even if it was dragon blood.

In other words, no matter how much Dragon Blood Qin Yu consumed, it would not have any effect. It would just be a waste.

He could only continue cultivating after he had absorbed enough dark energy.

Qin Yu stared at the dragon blood jar in front of him with mixed feelings.

As expected, there were two sides to everything.

The chaotic body gave him an extraordinary physique and strength that was far above the same realm, but it also made his cultivation much more difficult than ordinary people.

Zhuo Jing was still in closed-door cultivation. After he diluted the dragon blood and consumed it, the effect was still beyond imagination.

Qin Yu couldn’t bear to disturb him and planned to leave quietly.

But at this moment, a few figures appeared in front of Qin Yu not far away.

The strength of these people couldn’t be considered strong. They were only at the middle stage of the Almighty Realm, which was similar to Qin Yu’s realm.

But the greedy expressions on their faces made Qin Yu sense that something was wrong.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly and said coldly, “What’s the matter?”

“Hehe, nothing. I’m just interested in the jars in front of you, brother,”these people said.

“I wonder if you have any plans to sell them? Name Your Price!”Another person said.

Qin Yu said with a cold face, “No, this thing is not for sale.”

“Don’t be anxious. Maybe you can accept our conditions?”They continued.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said with a faint smile, “That’s fine. If you can give me a holy bone, I can consider it.”

Their expressions changed and they couldn’t help but say with a dark face, “Holy bone? If we have a holy bone, why would we exchange it with you for this lousy thing?”

“If we don’t have a holy bone, a holy weapon is also fine.”Qin Yu said with a cold smile.

“Kid, are you looking for fun over there?”The expressions of these people became more and more displeased.

Qin Yu said with a sneer, “I already said that this thing is not for sale. Do you not understand human language? Get lost quickly!”

After saying that, Qin Yu put away the jar in front of him and planned to leave.

However, these people blocked Qin Yu’s path. One of them even cast a spell, directly freezing the space in front of Qin Yu.

“Are you planning to attack me here? As far as I know, the divine capital doesn’t allow us to attack, right?”Qin Yu said with a cold face.

These people sneered and said, “It’s true that we are not allowed to attack here, but the thing in your hand is too tempting. We can only go against the rules.”

“At most, after we kill you, we can leave the divine capital.”

Qin Yu could not help but sneer. As expected, as long as the benefits were big enough, any rules could be ignored.

“I advise you all to Scram immediately,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“We can scram. Hand over the things and we’ll leave immediately,”these people said with a sneer.

Qin Yu originally did not want to make a move. After all, this city was built for him, so he naturally did not want to break the rules.

However, these people were so despicable that Qin Yu already had the desire to kill.

A cold murderous aura emanated from his body. He instantly broke free from the restraints and walked towards these people step by step.

Just as he was about to make a move, a few people dressed in uniform walked over quickly not far away.

“What are you doing! Do you want to make a move in the divine capital city!”The leading man shouted.

Seeing this person, Qin Yu’s killing intent gradually disappeared.

Qin Yu strode forward. Just as he was about to speak, these people were one step faster. They walked forward and said in a low voice, “This kid has a supreme treasure on him. If you don’t believe me, take a look for yourself.”

Following their gazes, these people noticed the dragon blood jar in front of Zhuo Jing.

The dragon blood in the jar emitted an extremely strange smell. Anyone could sense that this item was extraordinary.

The leader seemed to have smelled it as well. He narrowed his eyes slightly and then looked at Qin Yu.

“Whose is that thing?”The leader asked coldly.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said, “Does it matter who it is? It’s them who want to snatch the item and want to fight. Are You Blind?”

“How Dare You Insult Me? Men, arrest him immediately!”The leader immediately shouted.

Qin Yu could not help but sneer. He narrowed his eyes and said, “If I gave you this jar, would you still arrest me?”

That person was startled, and then said indifferently, “Wouldn’t it have been fine if you had done this earlier? Hand over the thing, and I can spare you.”

“As expected.”Qin Yu sneered. He raised his hand and smashed his head with a palm!

Everyone’s expressions changed immediately. They pointed at Qin Yu in panic and said, “You… you…”

Someone reacted and turned around to flee!

Those who were a step slower died in Qin Yu’s hands!

Qin Yu did not chase after them. He took a deep breath and strode towards the Royal Palace of the divine capital city.

In the royal palace, these people had already fled back. At this moment, they were gathering manpower to capture Qin Yu.

At this moment, Qin Yu was already beginning to get tired of it. This divine capital city was originally used for his escape. Now that it had become such a scene, how could he not be angry.

He took a deep breath and said coldly, “I’ll give you ten minutes. Immediately, all of you get out of the divine capital city!”
