Chapter 1237: Chapter 1,237. The black-robed man had arrived 

Had something happened?

Qin Yu frowned deeply.

In this world, was there anyone who could let something happen to Yan Ruoxue?

Just the two people beside him, no one could defeat them.

Could it be that they were referring to the Yan family?

“Don’t think too much. In any case, it wasn’t easy for the princess to come this time.”The two black-robed men seemed to have seen through Qin Yu’s doubts.

Although Qin Yu’s heart was filled with a lot of confusion, he didn’t continue arguing.

There must be a reason why Yan Ruoxue didn’t want to meet him.

Qin Yu walked to the side and squatted down, but his eyes kept staring at old Mister Yan’s room.

All he could think about was Yan Ruoxue.

The person he loved was right in front of him, but he couldn’t touch or touch her. This feeling was too uncomfortable.

“Eh?”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

Could it be that the danger they were talking about was because of the Dao Guardian?

Previously, the moustache had said that such casual travel was not allowed. This was also one of the reasons why the Dao Guardian existed.

They were wrapped up so tightly. Could it be because of the Dao Guardian?

Qin Yu suddenly stood up, as if he had discovered a new continent.

“Are you guys worried about the Dao Protector?”Qin Yu hurriedly walked in front of the two black-robed men.

The two of them said coldly, “I don’t want to repeat myself again. Also, I hope you don’t act like a retard.”

Qin Yu was instantly speechless. He was slightly embarrassed and retreated to the side.

It seemed that there was nothing wrong with his guess. Perhaps they were really afraid of the existence of the Dao Protector.

However, Qin Yu was really unwilling to see his beloved in front of him.

He could not help but walk back and forth at the door to eliminate the anxiety in his heart.

About half an hour later, Yan Ruoxue finally walked out of the Yan family’s manor.

Her face was covered by the black robe, but her clear eyes were soul-stirring.

Qin Yu stared at Yan Ruoxue and said anxiously, “Wait for me. I will go to the holy region soon. Wait for me!”

Yan Ruoxue was as anxious as Qin Yu. She wanted to stop many times, but was stopped by the people around her.

“Princess, we came to Earth this time to carry the master. It’s better to be careful,”a black-robed man reminded her.

“That’s right. If you go and look for him now, not only will you cause trouble for us, but Qin Yu will also be affected.”

After hearing these words, Yan Ruoxue did not stop in the end. She turned around and left.

Qin Yu stood there, quietly looking in Yan Ruoxue’s direction.

The feeling of meeting someone in love was indescribable.

To Qin Yu, Yan Ruoxue was like his first love. Even just smelling her internal Qi would make his heart flutter for a long time.

Qin Yu’s eyes were filled with reluctance until Yan ruoxue disappeared from his sight.

Yan Ruoxue’s appearance once again stimulated the longing hidden in Qin Yu’s heart.

He began to feel anxious, anxious to step into the holy region.

This kind of longing was too torturous.

“Old Mister Yan!”

At this moment, Qin Yu seemed to have thought of something.

The reason why old Mister Yan returned to life was because of this breath.

Now that he had seen Yan Ruoxue, the Qi in his chest would naturally disappear.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu anxiously ran upstairs.

He ran all the way to old Mister Yan’s room and pushed the door open.

At this moment, Old Mister Yan was lying on the bed, no longer breathing any internal Qi.

He looked extremely peaceful as he walked, and a faint smile hung on his face.

This scene made Qin Yu extremely sad.

“Even the top families of the Holy Region are unable to keep a dying life...”Qin Yu muttered softly, and a trace of sorrow couldn’t help but appear in his heart.

He walked up to old Mister Yan and half-kneeled.

“Old Mister Yan, have a safe journey,”Qin Yu murmured, as if he was sending off an old friend.

Then, he took out his phone and informed his brothers of the Yan family.

Yan Sihai and the others drove to the manor in the middle of the night.

In the manor, everyone covered their faces and cried, but Yan Sihai stood silently at the side.

He lit a cigar in his hand and kept smoking.

No one knew what Yan Sihai was thinking at this time.

“Arrange the funeral tomorrow,”Qin Yu said as he glanced at Yan Sihai.

Yan sihai nodded and said, “I’ll arrange it now.”

That night, old Mister Yan’s body was cremated, and the funeral was held as scheduled the next day.

Old Mister Yan was well-known in Jingdu, so there were naturally many people who came to pay their respects.

Qin Yu looked at this lively scene, but his heart was somewhat sorrowful.

The funeral continued from day to night, and Jingdu’s famous people came to pay their respects.

Qin Yu also saw many familiar figures, including ye Qing, Mister Zhou, and so on.

It was not until ten o’clock in the evening that the crowd slowly dispersed.

The Legend of business of a generation had come to an end.

Yan Sihai stood in front of old Mister Yan for a long time. For some unknown reason, a tear also flowed from his eyes. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Father, have a safe journey.”Yan Sihai lowered his head slightly and murmured in a low voice, as if he was repenting.

Qin Yu walked to his side and said coldly, “Yan Sihai, I hope you won’t disappoint old Mister Yan.”

Yan Sihai took out a cigar from his chest pocket and stuffed it into his mouth. He then sighed, “From the moment Jinyao left for the holy region, I have already regretted it.”

Qin Yu was stunned. He didn’t know whether what Yan Sihai said was true or not, but as a father, he might have already understood old Mister Yan’s mentality.

Just as the two of them were about to leave, two light winds suddenly blew over.

These two gusts of wind were extremely strange, as if they contained some sort of internal Qi.

The wind blew past Yan Sihai’s face, and in the next second, Yan Sihai fell into a deep sleep.

Two black-robed men suddenly appeared in front of Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s pupils constricted, and he exclaimed, “It’s You!”

“Don’t speak. Come with us,”the two of them said coldly.
