Chapter 76: Underground Boxing Ring Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

On this day, Qin Yu sat in the hotel while absorbing the spiritual energy from the surroundings with great difficulty.

There were many people in the provincial capital, but the land was sparse, and the spiritual energy was also extremely scarce. For the entire day, Qin Yu’s gains were almost negligible.

“It seems that the big city isn’t suitable for me,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Although that was the case, Qin Yu knew very well that although the spiritual energy in the big cities was scarce, other resources it had were far from what other cities could compare with.

For example, herbs. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

In Jiangcheng, herbs that were more than ten years old were considered precious. However, in the provincial capital, one could even see the king of herbs that were fifty or even a hundred years old.

At night, Song Wei called Qin Yu punctually.

She and Li Yan had already booked a restaurant early and were waiting for Qin Yu in the restaurant.

Half an hour later, Qin Yu and Yao Qing arrived at this restaurant.

Li Yan specially found a private room in the high-end restaurant. This restaurant was extremely expensive, and costed 20,000 yuan per person.

To Li Yan, this was definitely a huge sum of money.

After Qin Yu entered, Li Yan hurriedly stood up to welcome him.

“Mr. Qin, you’re here.” Li Yan’s attitude was extremely respectful.

This made Qin Yu a little embarrassed. He waved his hand and said, “There’s no need to be so polite.”

Li Yan smiled embarrassedly and said, “I’m sorry. I’ve been in the workforce for a long time. When I see someone with a higher status than me, I’m used to groveling.”

Qin Yu didn’t comment on this. This was indeed the reality.

Then, Li Yan called for the waiter to begin to serve the dishes.

The meal was extremely extravagant, with Boston lobster and French foie gras, almost all of which Qin Yu had never eaten before.

“Qin Yu, what kind of job do you have now? You’re so impressive that even Wei Jiang showed respect to you,” Song Wei asked at the dinner table.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “I don’t have any high status. I’m just an ordinary person.”

“Tsk, you’re so low-key,” Song Wei rolled her eyes and said.

Qin Yu smiled and didn’t explain.

Halfway through the meal, Qin Yu asked Yao Qing to pay the bill in advance.

At the end of the meal, Li Yan was a little drunk.

He patted his chest and said, “Mr. Qin, I’ll make the arrangements after the meal!”

Qin Yu hurriedly shook his head and said, “No, go back and rest after the meal.”

“That won’t do!” Li Yan said stubbornly.

“I know that big shots like you must be tired of bars and nightclubs. Later, I’ll take you to see the specialties of the provincial capital!” Li Yan said with some pride.

“Specialties?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows in interest.

Li Yan said in a low voice, “The most famous place in the provincial capital is the underground boxing ring! The fighters there are all black boxing, and there are countless martial artists!”

After saying that, Li Yan patted his chest and said, “Mr. Qin, to tell you the truth, although I’m very skinny, I’m also a martial artist. I can single handedly take down three to five people!”

Hearing this, Yao Qing, who was next to Qin Yu, couldn’t help but burst out laughing.

This made Li Yan even more determined to go to the underground boxing ring. He widened his eyes and said, “You don’t believe me, do you? I’ll let you see it later!”

“Okay, okay, okay, I’ll listen to you,” Qin Yu said helplessly.

However, Qin Yu was indeed quite interested in this underground boxing ring.

Ever since he heard about inner strength masters from Yao Qing, Qin Yu really wanted to see how strong inner strength masters were.

After dinner, the few of them left the restaurant together. Song Wei drove them to the underground boxing ring.

The car soon arrived at the entrance of a hotel.

After parking the car, Li Yan said with a smile, “Mr. Qin, this is a hotel on the upper level, and the underground boxing ring is two levels below. Those who can come here for fun are all affluent.”

Qin Yu nodded and glanced at the parking lot. As expected, there were many luxury cars parked nearby.

This also made Qin Yu more interested in this underground boxing ring.

Then, Li Yan led Qin Yu and the others to the underground boxing ring.

At the door, there were two strong men in suits guarding it. Qin Yu looked carefully and found that these two people were quite robust.

“It seems that this underground boxing ring is quite special,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

After Li Yan negotiated with the two muscular men, he waved his hand and said, “Mr. Qin, we can go in now!”

The few of them strode into the first level of the underground boxing ring.

As soon as they entered, Qin Yu heard commotion coming from inside.

There were shouts and curses. The layout of the underground boxing ring was similar to that of a bar.

There were scattered tables and booths all around. One could drink and eat.

The only difference was that the dance floor in front of them had been turned into a ring.

“Mr. Qin, follow me.” Li Yan waved his hand, then the few of them walked to a booth and sat down.

As soon as they sat down, the waiter came over with a wine list.

Qin Yu casually glanced around and found that the wine here was extremely expensive. A bottle of beer actually cost close to a hundred yuan.

At this moment, there were two brawny men brawling in the arena. Each of their punches seemed extremely lethal!

Every time someone fell, there would be excited shouts coming from all around. It was simply no different from a Colosseum.

“Mr. Qin, we can also place bets here on which contestant would win. Do you want to play?” Li Yan said with a smile.

Qin Yu waved his hand. He wasn’t interested in gambling at all.

“What’s so fun about this place? It’s too cruel.” Song Wei frowned and couldn’t help but turn her face to the side.

“Gee, you don’t understand. This is called the most primitive form of fighting! The most primitive form of violence!” Li Yan said excitedly.

He looked at the fighting on the stage and waved his hands.

Unfortunately, Li Yan was obviously an amateur.

“Yo, isn’t Li Yan?!”

At this moment, a woman with large bouncy curls and wearing a short skirt suddenly walked over.

She walked directly to Li Yan and said with a mocking expression, “Li Yan, do you think you are qualified to come to this kind of place for fun?”

When he saw this woman, Li Yan’s expression instantly turned a little ugly.

With a cold expression, he said, “It has nothing to do with you.”

The provocatively-dressed girl snorted and looked at Song Wei. She sneered and said, “Is this your new girlfriend? What? Has your taste in women changed? Do you like goody-two-shoes now?”

“Goody-two-shoes ? It’s obvious that she’s just pretending. There’s no telling how many men she’s actually screwing in reality!” A woman in a tight-fitting skirt beside the provocatively-dressed girl sneered.
