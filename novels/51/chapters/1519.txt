Chapter 1520: Chapter 1,520, the vicious Li Yingying 1

The black-robed man said indifferently, “At any time, as long as you make a move, we will rush to the battlefield within half an hour.”

Yong Ji slowly stood up. He looked at the black-robed man coldly and said, “Okay, I will trust you one last time.”

After saying this, Yong Ji swept his gaze over everyone and shouted, “Everyone listen up. Tomorrow, we will launch the second and final attack on the Heavenly Cloud Sect!”

“Yes!”Everyone immediately shouted.

...

At this moment, Qin Yu was waiting for Zhuo Jing’s return at the Zhuo family.

The next day, Zhuo Jing finally returned.

After seeing Zhuo Jing, Qin Yu quickly walked forward and said, “Brother Zhuo, how is it?”

Zhuo jing smiled and said, “I found a perfect place for you!”

“Then don’t waste time. Let’s set off now.”Qin Yu pulled Zhuo Jing and said.

Zhuo Jing said with a wry smile, “Brother Qin, I’m quite tired after running around these days. Can you at least let me drink some water?”

Only then did Qin Yu come back to his senses. He said somewhat embarrassedly, “I’m really sorry. I was too anxious.”

Zhuo Jing waved his hand and said with a smile, “Brother Qin, we’ll set off immediately after a moment. At the same time, we’ll protect you. I also have to make some preparations.”

......

Qin Yu nodded repeatedly. He returned to his room and waited for Zhuo Jing.

Not long after Zhuo Jing returned to his room, Li Yingying suddenly pushed open the door and entered.

“Brother Zhuo, you are back.”Li Yingying walked in with a smile.

Zhuo Jing nodded slightly and then said with a smile, “Yingying, you haven’t left yet.”

“How could I leave without saying goodbye?”Said Li Yingying.

Then, she sat opposite zhuo jing and said, “Brother Zhuo, where did you go this time?”

Zhuo Jing opened his mouth and was about to say something, but then he shook his head and said, “I went out for a while and did something.”

“Brother Zhuo, you’re so nervous. Did you go to do something bad?”Li Yingying pretended to be joking.

Zhuo Jing shook his head with a bitter smile and said, “Of course not. I just found a place for Brother Qin.”

“Eh? Where is brother Qin going? What does he want to Do?”Li Yingying pretended to be puzzled and asked.

Zhuo Jing shook his head and said, “I can’t tell you this for the time being. Don’t ask too much.”

“Aiya, Brother Zhuo, don’t tell me you don’t trust me?”Li Yingying shook Zhuo Jing’s arm and said.

Zhuo Jing smiled but didn’t say anything. This matter was of great importance, so he naturally wouldn’t say anything.

“Brother Zhuo, you know that I have always had thoughts about Qin Yu, but I haven’t been able to find a suitable way to tell him.”Li Yingying rolled her eyes and then sighed.

“Since it’s where Qin Yu is going, if you tell me, I can take the opportunity to get closer to Qin Yu,”Li Yingying said pitifully.

She kept shaking Zhuo Jing’s arm and said with a fawning tone, “Brother Zhuo Jing, I beg you. This involves my lifelong happiness. You Can’t not help me...”

As the saying goes, a spoiled woman had the best life. This was true.

Under Li Yingying’s pleas, Zhuo Jing had no choice but to agree, “Sigh, but this matter must not be told to others.”

“Definitely, definitely!”Li Yingying was instantly overjoyed.

Zhuo Jing had no choice but to tell Li Yingying the location of the destination.

After Li Yingying found out the location, she was immediately excited.

“Thank you, Brother Zhuo Jing! Then I’ll go first and give him a surprise!”Said Li Yingying.

Zhuo Jing nodded slightly and said with a smile, “Okay.”

After Li Yingying left, Zhuo Jing didn’t worry too much.

After all, in Zhuo Jing’s eyes, Li Yingying wasn’t a good person, but she wasn’t a bad person either.

With her strength, even if she really wanted to do something, it didn’t matter. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

With the Silver Spring in hand, Zhuo Jing wasn’t afraid of most people.

...

After Li Yingying left the Zhuo family, she quickly rushed to the heavenly cloud sect.

Of course, she wasn’t going to ask the Heavenly Cloud sect for help. Instead, she was going to tell Yongji this news and let him handle this matter.

At this moment, Yongji was just about to lead his troops into battle.

And the black-robed man was faintly discernible behind him. Without powerful strength, it was impossible to discover his tracks.

Just as he was about to leave, Li Yingying suddenly appeared outside the gate. Then, she was dragged in by Yongji’s foster sons.

“Foster father, this woman is sneaking around outside the gate. I don’t know what she is trying to do,”one of the foster sons said.

Li Yingying hurriedly explained, “Mr. Yongji, I’m here to report important news!”

“Important news?”Yongji’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he said, “I remember... You’re the daughter of the Li family, right?”

Li Yingying hurriedly nodded and said, “Yes, it’s me!”

Yongji sized her up and said, “Why are you looking for me?”

Li Yingying struggled to break free, and then said, “It’s news about Qin Yu! I just received news that Qin Yu plans to break through! The location is in the Falling Life Valley!”

“Break through?”Yong Ji narrowed his eyes.

Li Yingying hurriedly said, “Yes, he is about to step into the mighty realm and is looking for a safe place!”

Yong Ji raised his eyebrows and said with a smile that was not a smile, “I remember that you and Qin Yu seem to have a good relationship, right? Why are you telling me this?”

As soon as these words were said, Li Yingying immediately said with a cold face, “That Qin Yu doesn’t want face when he is given face. This kind of person will die a horrible death! I want to cut him into a thousand pieces!”

“That’s true,”Yongji’s adopted son said.

Yongji also nodded slightly. He had tried to make friends with Qin Yu many times, but was rejected by Qin Yu. This person really didn’t want to be given face.

“What’s the use of telling me this?”Yongji asked back.

Li Yingying hurriedly said, “Mr. Yongji, don’t you want to get rid of that Qin Yu? It’s a good time to kill him when he breaks through!”

Yongji narrowed his eyes slightly and said, “Then why don’t you go?”

Li Yingying said awkwardly, “With my ability, I’m afraid I can’t do it. Most importantly, there’s also Protector Zhuo Jing. Zhuo Jing has a silver spring in his hand...”

“Void-returning artifact, and it’s not an ordinary void-returning artifact,”Yongji commented.

But at this time, he changed the topic, he said indifferently, “Why should I stop Qin Yu from stepping into the mighty realm? If he steps into the mighty realm, he will definitely attack the Tianyun sect. At that time, it will be good news for me.”

Li Yingying was startled and hurriedly said, “But... What about in the future? At that time...”

“Enough, no need to say more.”Yong Ji waved his hand and interrupted Li Yingying’s words.

It was obvious that he didn’t want to get involved in this matter at all.

Li Yingying still wanted to say something, but Yong Ji waved his hand and interrupted her.

“You can leave now,”Yong Ji said coldly.

Yong Ji decided not to make a move, but the black-robed man hiding behind him heard it clearly.

“I’m about to break through... This is good news...”the black-robed man muttered in a low voice, and a cold smile appeared on his face.

Then, his figure slowly faded away and disappeared without a trace.
