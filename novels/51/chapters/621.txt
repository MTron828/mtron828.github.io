Chapter 622: The Power of Yan Ruoxue’s Bloodline Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu knew very well that these two corpses could be time bombs and could resurrect at any time.

Therefore, after thinking for a long time, Qin Yu decided to get the clothes to suppress the two male corpses.

After preparing everything, Qin Yu walked out of the tomb.

After coming to the top, Qin Yu released his divine sense.

Soon, he caught sight of the figure of the man with the mustache.

According to the position in his divine sense, Qin Yu strode in the direction of the man with the mustache.

After walking for dozens of minutes, he finally found the man with the mustache digging out a babe in front of a tomb.

Judging from the exhausted look on the man with the mustache’s expression, he must have obtained a lot of treasures during this period of time.

“It seems that you have gained quite a lot.” Qin Yu walked behind the man with the mustache and said with a smile.

Hearing this, the man with the mustache hurriedly covered the pottery pot in his hand and stammered, “What harvest? This is my first piece...”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “Alright, I won’t fight with you. No matter what you have obtained during this period of time, it is yours.”

The man with the mustache immediately heaved a sigh of relief. He patted his chest and muttered, “You scared me.”

“But... I have a condition.” Qin Yu changed the topic and said with a smile.

“What condition?” The man with the mustache said with vigilance.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “I want the clothes of the masked woman.”

“Clothes?” The man with the mustache was stunned.

“What do you want those clothes for?”

Qin Yu said, “I brought out the coffin and the two male corpses, so I need the clothes.”

“What?!” Hearing this, the man with the mustache ran a few meters away!

He said with vigilance, “Qin Yu, are you crazy? You dared to bring that thing out?”

Qin Yu spread his hands and said, “This coffin is full of dark energy. It’s a holy object for cultivation to me, so I naturally can’t miss out on it.”

“You...” the man with the mustache gave Qin Yu a thumbs up. “You’re impressive.”

“Cut the crap and give me the clothes.” Qin Yu rolled his eyes.

The man with the mustache didn’t hesitate. He took out the clothes and handed them to Qin Yu.

“I have to remind you that that thing is very dangerous. You’d better be careful,” the man with the mustache said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I understand.”

After putting away the clothes, Qin Yu stood to the side and waited for the man with the mustache.

At this moment, the reputation of the three people from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association had already soared!

The reason was that they were almost evenly matched with the second-ranked Kong Yun!

Although Kong Yun won with one move in the end, his entire body was heavily injured and he was covered in blood!

This news immediately shocked the entire martial arts world!

Not only that, but the Martial Arts Association also quickly released a statement: the three of them aren’t the strongest in our Martial Arts Association, but we can create countless martial artists with their strength.

Once this news was released, everyone immediately gasped!

If the Jingdu Martial Arts Association could create countless martial artists like this, then who else could be compared to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association in the future?

Inside the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

Yan Sihai sat opposite Qu Xie, and beside him was Yan Jinyao.

“Qu Xie, what’s going on?” Yan Sihai said with a frown while smoking his cigar.

“When did the Jingdu Martial Arts Association secretly train such a group of powerhouses?”

Qu Xie said with a smile, “Mr. Yan, this is a secret of our Martial Arts Association, so...”

“Bullsh*t!” Yan Sihai cursed.

“I heard that this matter has something to do with Yan Ruoxue! What did you do to Yan Ruoxue?!”

Qu Xie’s expression suddenly changed.

This was a secret of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. How did Yan Sihai know about it?

“Qu Xie, don’t underestimate me, and don’t underestimate the Yan family,” Yan Sihai seemed to see Qu Xie’s doubt and immediately warned him coldly.

Qu Xie fell into silence and said in a deep voice, “Mr. Yan, I don’t mean to underestimate the Yan family. Even our higher-ups have never underestimated the Yan family.”

“Then tell me quickly,” Yan Sihai said impatiently.

Seeing that he couldn’t hide it anymore, Qu Xie could only tell him slowly.

“This matter is indeed related to Miss Yan,” said Qu Xie.

“A fortune teller once said that a top-tier bloodline would appear in the Yan family. Before this, we had always thought that the top-tier bloodline belonged to Young Master Yan Jinyao.”

“But... later, the higher-ups gave an order. That bloodline didn’t belong to Young Master Yan, but to Miss Yan.”

Hearing this, Yan Sihai was furious and slammed the table!

“Bullsh*t! What nonsense! Yan Ruoxue is just an ordinary person, not even a martial artist. How could she have a top-tier bloodline?” Yan Sihai said angrily. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Yan Jinyao’s expression was also cold.

This was a heavy blow to him.

Qu Xie said with a bitter smile, “We didn’t want to believe it, but the facts proved that Miss Yan is indeed the inheritor of that bloodline.”

“We relied on Miss Yan’s bloodline to create several super powerhouses! This is enough to prove everything.”

Yan Sihai gritted his teeth. His face was livid with anger.

Old Master Yan had always favored Yan Ruoxue, which made Yan Sihai even more unwilling to see Yan Ruoxue’s good side.

“What bullsh*t bloodline?” Yan Jinyao said coldly.

“Arrange that so-called super powerhouse of yours to fight with me. I will prove to you that the so-called super powerhouse is not worth mentioning.”

“As for the bloodline you are talking about, it is just an illusion.”

After saying this, Yan Jinyao turned around and left.

Qu Xie said, “Mr. Yan, this...”

“Do as my son says,” Yan Sihai snorted coldly.

Qu Xie smiled. “Yes, but if Young Master Yan is injured, I hope Mr. Yan won’t mind.”

“Hehe, if my son is injured, those super powerhouses of yours will definitely die.”

Yan Sihai continued, “By the way, Yan Ruoxue is a member of the Yan family. Now that you have used the bloodline of the Yan family to create super powerhouses, shouldn’t the Yan family get some benefits as well?”

“Mr. Yan, now you care that Yan Ruoxue is a member of the Yan Family?” At this moment, the assistant beside Qu Xie said with a smile.

Yan Sihai glanced at him coldly and said, “You have provoked me many times. I have been displeased with you for a long time.”

“Shut up!”

The assistant wanted to say something, but was interrupted by Qu Xie’s loud shout.

Then, Qu Xie said with a smile, “Mr. Yan, if Young Master Yan is willing, we can provide him with Yan Ruoxue’s bloodline. We can even let him bathe in the bloodline and get the most complete bloodline power.”
