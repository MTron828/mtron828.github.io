Chapter 551: Qin Yu’s Scheme Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Then, Zhen Yue began to take off her upper body clothes.

Qin Yu hurriedly asked, “What are you doing?”

Zhen Yue brushed her hair and said, “Don’t worry. I promised you that I won’t hold you responsible.”

After saying that, Zhen Yue walked toward Qin Yu.

Qin Yu hurriedly said, “Hurry up and put on your clothes. I don’t need it.”

“Also, let me tell you, I won’t do anything that betrays Yan Ruoxue.”

Zhen Yue whispered, “Mr. Qin, no one will know about this.”

Qin Yu said with a cold expression, “If you do this again, I’ll leave.”

After saying this, Qin Yu got up and was about to leave.

“Mr. Qin, don’t go.” Zhen Yue hurriedly stopped Qin Yu.

She put on her clothes again, and Qin Yu stayed behind.

“Then I’ll transfer the money to you later,” said Zhen Yue.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “Sect Master Zhen, if you really want to help me, why don’t you tell me what secret is under the lake?”

Zhen Yue seemed to have guessed that Qin Yu would ask this, so she didn’t look too surprised.

“It’s a long story,” Zhen Yue said in a deep voice.

After Zhen Yue’s explanation, Qin Yu finally knew the origin of this lake.

This lake was called Iceheart Lake, and it had been here for thousands of years.

Zhen Yue’s ancestors were responsible for guarding the Iceheart Lake, and it was the same for every generation. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“According to my father, this place was once a prosperous sect ten thousand years ago,” Zhen Yue said.

“As for the Iceheart Lake, it was created by that sect. My father said that as long as we guard this lake, it will definitely return to its peak.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything.

It seemed like there was something underneath that gap.

It was either a treasure left behind by that sect ten thousand years ago, or sealed spiritual energy.

Moreover, this spiritual energy had probably been sealed for tens of thousands of years.

“If I can open that gap, I wonder how much spiritual energy will be released,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Unfortunately, with Qin Yu’s current ability, it was impossible for him to open the gap.

“Have you looked under the water?” Qin Yu asked.

Zhen Yue nodded and said, “I have. I know that all the spiritual energy in Iceheart Lake was released from that gap.”

“Is there any way to open that gap?” Qin Yu asked immediately.

Zhen Yue immediately looked at Qin Yu warily.

Obviously, she didn’t want others to get their hands on the Iceheart Lake.

However, this also revealed one thing: Zhen Yue definitely knew how to open that gap!

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “How about this, why don’t we work together?”

“Work together?” Zhen Yue was a bit puzzled.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Don’t you want to restore the glory of the Beaufort Tower?”

“Of course I do,” Zhen Yue said with a bitter smile.

“But how can the current situation allow the Beaufort Tower to develop? It’s already good enough for me to get to where I am today,” Zhen Yue sighed slightly.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “If you are willing, why don’t you let me join? We can manage the sect together.”

A trace of surprise appeared on Zhen Yue’s face, but she wasn’t in a hurry to answer.

Qin Yu continued, “With my current appeal, I believe that more people will definitely join the Beaufort Tower.”

“With my ability to refine medicine and the Iceheart Lake, it won’t be difficult to build a top-tier sect.”

Zhen Yue was finally somewhat tempted.

She stared at Qin Yu and asked tentatively, “Mr. Qin, is what you said true?”

“Of course.” Qin Yu nodded.

“You can continue to be the Sect Master. As for me... You can give me any position.”

Zhen Yue was obviously tempted by Qin Yu’s words.

There wasn’t even a half-step Martial Marquis in the entire Beaufort Tower. If Qin Yu could join, it would definitely be a good thing for Beaufort Tower!

Qin Yu struck while the iron was hot. “The Saint Confucian Sect has already discovered the Iceheart Lake. Do you think you can resist them?”

Zhen Yue fell into silence.

That’s right. As the number one sect in the north, the Saint Confucian Sect wasn’t something Zhen Yue could deal with.

“You can think about it. I won’t force you.” Qin Yu stood up and was about to leave.

At this moment, Zhen Yue suddenly said, “Mr. Qin, I agree with your suggestion.”

Qin Yu was delighted, but he remained calm.

He turned around and said, “Okay, then I wish us a pleasant cooperation.”

Zhen Yue said in a low voice, “From tomorrow onwards, you will be the Vice Sect Master of Beaufort Tower.”

The cooperation between the two of them was reached at this moment.

After walking out of the office, Qin Yu couldn’t help but think inside, “This woman is so gullible.”

In this way, Qin Yu still got the Iceheart Lake.

As for how to open the gap, Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry.

When the Saint Confucian Sect came to invade the next time, Zhen Yue would naturally tell Qin Yu the method to open the gap.

Although Qin Yu’s action was a bit despicable, Qin Yu had no other way now.

As long as he could enter the Martial Marquis realm as soon as possible, he was willing to do anything.

The next day, Beaufort Tower changed its name to Green Moon Villa.

Qin Yu immediately posted a message on the Martial Arts Forum:

Green Moon Villa was officially established, and Qin Yu was appointed as the Deputy Sect Master. From today onwards, it would recruit talents from all over the world to target the Saint Confucian Sect.

Once this news was released, it immediately caused a heated discussion!

One had to know that Qin Yu was a sensational figure recently. Ever since his battle with Han Wei, he became even more famous, and he was worshipped by countless people!

Therefore, after seeing this news, many people were eager to join.

“Qin Yu is going to openly challenge the various major powers!”

“To be more precise, the various major powers in Jingdu!”

“I wonder if the Green Moon Villa can surpass the Saint Confucian Sect!”

“I think there’s a chance. Once Qin Yu steps into the Martial Marquis, the Saint Confucian Sect won’t be a threat.”

“Right, not to mention that Qin Yu h is an apothecary, and is also a favorite of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s Pavilion Master! Who wouldn’t be tempted by such resources?”

When he saw the messages on the forum, the corners of Qin Yu’s mouth curled up into a smile.

He put down his phone and said in a low voice, “I reckon the Saint Confucian Sect will take action soon.”

...

The Saint Confucian Sect.

After they heard the news, they immediately notified Gu Canghai.

“Sect Master, Qin Yu has established the Green Moon Villa and started to recruit talents,” Deng Sheng said over the phone.

“As far as we know, the Iceheart Lake is in the Green Moon Villa.”

Gu Canghai’s expression turned cold when he heard that.

He narrowed his eyes and said, “Qin Yu, you’re really bold. I was worried that I wouldn’t be able to find you...”

After hanging up the phone, Gu Canghai immediately rushed to the Green Moon Villa!
