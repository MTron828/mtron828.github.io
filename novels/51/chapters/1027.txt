Chapter 1028: Chapter 1,028, fighting against five martial saints alone!

No matter how much effort Wan Gu Qiong put in, he was unable to shake this space in the slightest!

He turned around and looked at Qin Yu with a face as white as paper.

Wan Zhengye, who was standing in front of him, appeared to be much calmer.

He placed his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “I’ve long heard of your great name. I’ve finally been able to meet you today.”

Qin Yu, however, said with a gloomy face, “You Old Thing, is this how you educate your son? Do you know your sins for not teaching your father?”

He opened his mouth and gave Wan Zhengye a show of strength. This made Wan Zhengye’s originally warm expression freeze on his face.

He suppressed the anger in his heart and cupped his hands, saying, “You’re right. It’s indeed my fault for not being able to discipline him first. I will definitely discipline him in the future.”

Speaking up to this point, Wan Zhengye paused for a moment and said with a smile, “There’s no deep enmity between us. There’s no need for us to go to the extent of fighting each other.”

“F * ck you. Do you think that I came here today to talk about family matters with you?”Qin Yu said with a cold face.

Wan Zhengye gritted his teeth and said, “Qin Yu, why don’t we sit down and have a good talk? There’s still room for negotiation.”

“Talk?”Qin Yu’s face turned cold as he said coldly, “The Wan Gu Qiong killed so many people in the Green Moon Villa. How Can We Talk?”

“Who will be responsible for the deaths of those innocent people?”

Wan Zhengye smiled awkwardly and said, “I can make it up to you. I don’t know what you want.”

“Make it up to you? What can you make it up to me?”Qin Yu sneered.

“No matter what you have, the Wan Gu Qiong and you must die today.”

Wan Zhengye’s face turned completely cold.

“So there’s nothing to talk about?”Wan Zhengye narrowed his eyes and said.

“Cut the crap. If you kill the Wan Gu Qiong now and then kill yourself, there’s still a chance.”.

“How dare you! Do you really think I’m afraid of You?”Wan Zhengye shouted.

As he spoke, four people walked towards him.

These four people were all martial saints and were also the four great protectors of the Wan family. Their strength was unfathomable!

“You are only a martial saint. How can you defeat the five of us?”Wan Zhengye said coldly.

Qin Yu’s gaze slowly swept across these people. Then, he sneered and said, “Just five good-for-nothings.”

“Good-for-nothings? Kid, what did you say? !”This instantly angered the four great protectors!

Wan Zhengye said coldly, “A kid who doesn’t know the immensity of Heaven and earth. Since that’s the case, then don’t blame us for being impolite!”

After he finished speaking, the five people’s bodies burst out with the might of a martial saint at the same time!

This aura spread out, and the supreme pressure was like a black cloud, making it difficult for people to break through the internal Qi.

This was a great battle between martial saints. Ordinary people could not participate in it. Therefore, they subconsciously stepped back, leaving a large space.

Qin Yu faced five martial saints, but there was not the slightest trace of panic on his face.

His calm and composed face made people extremely uneasy.

Wan Zhengye said in a deep voice, “I will ask you one last time, must you stand?”

Qin Yu sneered and pushed his palm forward. The family flag that was erected in the Wan family’s secret realm was instantly broken.

Although he didn’t say anything, his meaning was very obvious.

Wan Zhengye said with a dark face, “Four great protectors, listen to my orders. Follow me and kill this Qin Yu!”

“Yes!”The four of them stepped forward in unison.

The Great Protector could no longer hold it in. He took the initiative to attack and raised his hand to unleash a great killing technique!

Marks formed on the Great Protector’s palm, and a vast ocean appeared behind him!

The ocean seemed to be corporeal. It carried a roar that contained divine power as it hovered in the air and roiled!

“Annihilate all living things!”The Great Protector roared angrily as he slapped his palm forward!

The vast ocean that hung above his head also moved!

It whizzed over to the ocean and instantly turned into a divine flood dragon that came out of the water. It pounced at Qin Yu with a Roar!

“The insect seal technique is not worth mentioning.”Qin Yu’s expression did not change. He slid his hand and a golden fist instantly appeared!

A world-shaking divine power gathered on Qin Yu’s fist.

The Sun and moon that seemed to descend from the sky seemed to be about to vaporize the vast ocean, but it also seemed to be about to shatter the divine flood dragon’s Head!

“Boom!”

The Golden Fist contained an invincible might and instantly shattered the divine flood dragon!

The divine flood dragon was shattered into pieces!

As for the Great Protector, he suffered a backlash. He took a few steps back before he stabilized his body!

“This kid is not easy to deal with!”The Great Protector’s face was pale as a grave expression appeared on his face.

The other protectors did not say a word, and Wan Zhengye was extremely uneasy.

The technique just now was the Great Protector’s famous ultimate skill, but it was shattered by Qin Yu’s punch.

This was enough to show that the gap in strength between the two of them was even greater than they had imagined.

“All of you, attack together,”Qin Yu said coldly.

At the moment of life and death, they did not care about fairness and face anymore.

The few of them looked at each other and immediately attacked at the same time, unleashing their great killing techniques one after another!

In an instant, rays of light shot into the sky and the aura they emitted shook the entire mystic realm to the point that it rumbled!

These killing techniques seemed to be competing with the sun and moon for brilliance. Any wisp of internal Qi emitted from them was enough to annihilate one’s soul!

The few beams of light that shot into the sky came from different directions like an inescapable net, trapping Qin Yu within!

“Slash!”

Wan Zhengye roared loudly! His palm suddenly pushed forward!

The four great protectors simultaneously used their divine power, as if they were planning to kill Qin Yu within!

“Under this technique, even a mighty figure would have to think twice. You’re Dead!”Wan Zhengye roared crazily!

The rays of light were like sharp blades as they slashed towards Qin Yu, trapping him within.

For a moment, that area of space formed a vortex that swirled wildly!

Everyone’s hearts were in their throats.

Such a great killing technique was simply unheard of!

“Boom!”

But right at this moment, a sound erupted from the center of the Vortex!

The golden light that was the size of a grain of rice was rapidly expanding!

In the blink of an eye, that golden light had covered the sun and moon and erupted!

The great killing technique that the five of them had unleashed at the same time was shattered into dust at this moment! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Wan Zhengye and the others took a step back one after another as a pale expression appeared on their faces!

At a glance, they could only see Qin Yu standing there without moving an inch. Only his body was emitting a golden light.

“This... This Qin Yu didn’t make a move at all!”

“In other words... He used his own aura to shatter the great killing technique of the five martial saints? !”
