The godly king stood in front of Xiao Sheng. He was drenched in cold sweat and his entire body was trembling. He did not dare to say a single word.

Although he was the godly king of the northern lands, at this moment, he was like an ordinary person who was drowning and waiting for rescue.

Xiao Sheng looked at him for a long time before saying coldly, “You should leave. Go back and tell the Master of the northern lands that I will wait for his complete resurrection.”

“Yes... Yes.”

After saying this, the godly king took off and ran. He did not dare to stay for even a moment!

Facing such a figure, he did not even have the slightest thought of resisting!

After the godly king left, Xiao Sheng sighed slightly.

“I have to change places again,”Xiao Sheng muttered softly.

After escaping for dozens of stars, the godly king finally stopped to catch his breath.

At this moment, he had also regained his senses and could not help but feel frustrated.

Just now, he could have completely escaped through the formation of the northern lands. Why was there a need to be so panicked?

However, thinking about it, Baro did not even have the chance to escape before he was killed. It was impossible not to be afraid.

After that, the godly king did not stop and immediately returned to the northern lands.

In front of the snow mountain.

The godly king knelt on the ground and explained the entire incident to the master of the northern lands.

“He... he used a hoe and killed Barrow with it...”

When he recalled the scene not too long ago, he still felt a lingering fear and broke out in cold sweat.

“Barrow is just a piece of trash. There’s nothing to be surprised about.”The voice of an elementalist came from the snow mountain.

Even though that was the case, the elementalist who had been searching for the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect did not have any intention of finding him at this moment.

“Master, he also asked me to pass on a message to you,”the Divine King continued.

The elementalist remained silent and waited for his follow-up.

The Divine King said with a trembling voice, “He... he said that he will wait for you to fully recover...”

Upon hearing this, the elementalist sneered and said, “He will pay the price for his arrogance.”

The northern lands was a relatively safe place. With the Death River, even the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect would not be able to cross it.

Hence, the elementalists were not worried. Everyone knew the consequences of forcefully crossing the river of death. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Weapon Refining City.

Qin Yu and Xiao Cao were sitting in the guest room, waiting for Master Zhengyang.

In the blink of an eye, the two of them had waited for an entire day. However, Master Zhengyang had not appeared for a long time.

Although Qin Yu was anxious, he still needed help. There was nothing he could do but wait.

A moment later, footsteps could be heard from outside.

Qin Yu hurriedly stood up and went out to welcome him.

Not long after, he saw an extremely wretched-looking old man walk in.

Qin Yu could not help but be a little surprised.

This person was Master Zhengyang? It was not quite what he had imagined.

“Greetings, Master Zhengyang.”

Just as Qin Yu was still puzzled, Xiao Cao had already walked up and greeted him.

When he saw Xiao Cao, master Zhengyang’s face immediately revealed an extremely wretched smile.

He walked forward and grabbed Xiao Cao’s hand. He said with a smile, “I thought someone was looking for me. So it’s Xiao Cao.”

Xiao Cao struggled free from Master Zhengyang in a panic. Then, she said somewhat awkwardly, “It’s Qin Yu looking for you...”

Master Zhengyang glanced at Qin Yu and said with a smile, “You want to find me to refine artifacts?”

Qin Yu cupped his hands and said, “Greetings, Master Zhengyang. I do need your help.”

Master Zhengyang sized up Qin Yu and said, “My fee is not cheap. It will cost at least 100 million spirit coins each time, and it depends on the material.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “There is no problem with the money. As for the material... It is my body.”

Master Zhengyang was stunned for a moment, and then he said somewhat angrily, “Kid, are you playing with me?”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “What I said is true. It’s indeed this body of mine.”

Master Zhengyang said with extreme displeasure, “I’m a Master of artifact refining. How do you refine this body of yours?”

“Master Zhengyang, what Qin Yu said is true,”Xiao Cao quickly said.

Then, Xiao Cao told Master Zhengyang what had happened.

After hearing Xiao Cao’s words, master zhengyang said in surprise, “You used the purplish red heaven fire in the abandoned pool to temper your body?”

“Yes, I have been tempering my body for many days, but my speed is still too slow. That’s why I thought of Master Zhengyang,”Qin Yu said very politely.

Master Zhengyang looked at Qin Yu and frowned, “What kind of physique is this?”

Qin Yu did not hide it and immediately told Master Zhengyang about his physique.

After Master Zhengyang heard it, he could not help but stroke his chin and said in a low voice, “It’s not impossible for me to help you, but I have a condition.”

“In addition to the 100 million spirit coins, I also want a drop of your blood essence. How about it?”Master Zhengyang said with a smile.

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Blood essence was extremely precious to cultivators. Moreover, it was only used once or twice. Usually, they would choose to use it out of desperation.

“If you are in a difficult situation, then forget it.”Master Zhengyang waved his hand.

“Alright, I Promise You.”Qin Yu gritted his teeth.

To Qin Yu, time was extremely tight. Although blood essence was precious, time was even more precious.

Seeing that Qin Yu had agreed, master Zhengyang put on his smiling face again.

He said with a smile, “It’s too late today. Tomorrow, I’ll start to refine your body tomorrow. What do you think?”

“It’s all up to master,”said Qin Yu.

“Hehe, then it’s a deal,”master Zhengyang said with a smile.

“Let’s go. Since you’re here, you’re a guest. Come and eat with me.”

Master Zhengyang held Qin Yu and Xiao Cao’s hands enthusiastically and walked to another room.

Qin Yu couldn’t refuse, so he could only agree.

At the dining table, master Zhengyang personally cooked a table full of dishes.

“You guys wait here. It’ll be ready in a while,”master Zhengyang said with a smile.

Qin Yu said politely, “Sorry to trouble you, Master.”

“There’s nothing to trouble you with. I’ve known Xiao Cao for a long time, right, Xiao Cao?”Master Zhengyang said with a smile.

Xiao Cao lowered her head and didn’t say anything.

Master Zhengyang didn’t stay any longer and turned around to walk out.

In the kitchen.

Master Zhengyang took out a dark green pill from his pocket.

“Hehe, it finally came in handy.”Master Zheng Yang toyed with the pill, his face revealing an extremely wretched expression.

Following that, master Zheng Yang put the pill into the soup.

The instant the pill entered, it instantly melted without a trace.

Master Zheng Yang licked his lips and said with a wretched expression, “As long as you eat this pill, no matter what kind of chaste and virtuous woman you are, you have to obediently submit!”

He put away the wretched expression on his face and returned to the room with the bowl of soup.

“Come, quickly remove the heat and eat it.”Master Zhengyang rubbed his hands and said with a smile.

Qin Yu and Xiao Cao did not think much and picked up their chopsticks to eat.

“Drink more soup. This soup is very nutritious, especially for women.”Master Zhengyang personally filled a bowl of soup and pushed it in front of Xiao Cao.
