Chapter 1403: Chapter 1,403, not helping 1

Tie Dan could not help but raise his head. He stared at this scene, and a trace of excitement appeared in his eyes.

“TSK TSK, what a big deal. I haven’t participated in such a big battle for a long time,”tie Dan licked his lips and said.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Stop talking nonsense. It’s too late.”

The carriage had already arrived above the divine capital city. The first elder stood on the carriage, looking down at the city from above.

“Qin Yu, come out and face your death!”The first Elder’s voice was like rolling thunder, shaking the entire world.

The divine capital city was silent. Only tie Dan was anxiously reviving the divine patterns.

“Qin Yu, come out and face your death!”The first elder shouted again.

The others also roared, “What? Are you going to be a coward? Aren’t you afraid of embarrassing yourself by doing such a Cowardly Act?”

Iron Egg, who was resurrecting the divine patterns, couldn’t take it anymore.

“F * ck you! Who are you talking about? Do you really think I’m afraid of You?”Iron egg rolled up his sleeves, ready to fight.

Qin Yu hurriedly said, “They are scolding me. Don’t waste time. Hurry Up!”

Iron egg then muttered, “F * ck you! I’ve lived for more than a thousand years, but I’ve never been treated like this! If I didn’t have only one primordial spirit left, I would have ripped your heads off!”

The divine patterns continued to revive in an orderly manner, while the outside world continued to curse incessantly.

“Listen up.”Finally, the first elder lost his patience.

He said coldly, “Since this Qin Yu doesn’t appear, then destroy this city!”

“First elder, wait a moment.”At this moment, a disciple beside the first elder suddenly walked forward.

“I suspect that there is a trap. If we act rashly, we might fall into a trap.”

The first elder glanced at him. Before he could speak, the hemp robed old man beside him coldly laughed, “What kind of trap can there be? He is merely a cowardly turtle who does not dare to appear. We will just destroy the city and force him to reveal himself.”

“No. This battle has spread throughout the entire southern region. We can not afford to have even the slightest mishap. Otherwise, the reputation of the Tianyun sect will be lost.”The disciple continued.

The great elder stroked his beard and seemed to think that it made sense.

“Then what do you think we should do?”The Great Elder asked.

The disciple cupped his hands and said, “I think it’s better to send two or three people to the divine capital to investigate.”

The great elder narrowed his eyes and said faintly, “A lion uses its full strength when hunting a rabbit. It makes sense.”

With that, the great elder looked at the disciple and said, “Then it’s up to you.”

The Disciple’s expression changed and he hurriedly said, “Great Elder, it’s... It’s better to let someone else go...”

“Why? Are You Afraid of Death?”The great elder sneered.

The disciple hurriedly knelt down and said, “I... I’m afraid of Death...”

“If you’re afraid of death, aren’t others afraid of Death?”The great elder suddenly shouted angrily.

He looked coldly at the disciple and said, “It’s up to you. If you don’t go, I’ll kill you right now!”

Under the pressure of the first elder, this disciple was trembling with fear as he walked towards the divine capital.

The door slowly opened, and he trembled as if he was treading on thin ice.

The moment he stepped in, the powerful force of the divine inscriptions immediately pressed him to the ground.

He, who was already on the edge of panic, immediately shouted, “Not good, there’s an ambush, there’s a trap!”

With such a shout, Tie Dan, who was reviving the divine inscriptions formation, naturally heard it clearly.

“Not good, they’ve barged in.”Tie Dan’s expression changed slightly as he hurriedly increased his speed.

As for the first elder and the others, they frowned slightly as well. He looked down at that disciple and shouted, “What’s going on! ?”

That disciple tried to stand up from the ground. He took a glance at his own body and was surprised to find that he was fine. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I... I’m fine...”the disciple said awkwardly.

“Humph, you must be scared. You’re useless.”The linen-robed elder could not help but snort.

The disciple continued to move forward. He was surprised to find that he was fine.

Therefore, the disciple said in surprise, “Great Elder, it’s fine. There’s nothing in Here!”

The great elder narrowed his eyes and frowned, “Nothing? Did that Qin Yu Trick You?”

“Great Elder, I... I’m going out,”the disciple said nervously.

Before he finished his words, a huge force suddenly burst out!

In the next second, the Disciple’s head was directly smashed by a punch!

“It’s Qin Yu!”The great elder narrowed his eyes and quickly found Qin Yu’s figure!

“I didn’t expect that I would be able to kill someone before I fell asleep...”tie Dan opened his mouth and licked the blood stains on his hands, revealing a comfortable smile.

Qin Yu hurriedly asked, “How is it? Has the divine imprints array revived?”

Tie Dan didn’t pay any attention to him. He closed his eyes slightly and muttered in a low voice.

Not long after, a golden light flashed within the city!

The Golden Light appeared from the center and then enveloped the entire city!

“It’s done...”tie Dan’s voice instantly became extremely weak.

This was a matter that consumed a lot of spiritual sense. Even a powerful primordial spirit like tie Dan could not withstand it.

Before Qin Yu could say anything, tie Dan fell into a deep sleep again.
