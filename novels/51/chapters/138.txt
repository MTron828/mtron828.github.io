Chapter 139: Who Do You Think You Are? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

On the other end, Su Yan sneered. “He’s about to die. It’s up to you whether you want to see him or not.”

After saying this, Su Yan hung up the phone.

Qin Yu’s expression instantly became a little ugly, and he stood up.

“Mr. Qin, what’s wrong?” Seeing this, Yao Qing hurriedly walked forward and asked.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “Give me the car keys. I’m going out for a while.”

“Where are you going? I’ll go with you,” Yao Qing hurriedly said.

“No need.” Qin Yu shook his head.

After taking the car keys, Qin Yu quickly rushed to the Su family’s home.

He sped all the way, and soon, Qin Yu arrived at the door of the Su family’s home.

At this moment, there were many cars parked at the door. Obviously, the relatives of the Su family had come.

Qin Yu found a random place to park his car and then hurriedly walked towards the Su family’s house.

The moment he stepped into the Su family’s gate, he saw many relatives of the Su family sitting together. However, there wasn’t a trace of sadness on their faces. Instead, everyone was beaming with joy, as if it was a family gathering.

“What are you doing here?!” The moment he saw Qin Yu, Su Wen stood up and shouted angrily.

“Get the h*ll out of here. You are no longer a member of the Su family!”

Qin Yu ignored him and asked in a cold voice, “Where is Grandpa?”

“What has it got to do with you? This is our family’s business and has nothing to do with you!” Su Wen said in a cold voice.

“I am asking where your grandpa is?!” Qin Yu immediately shouted!

This angry roar contained Qin Yu’s spiritual power, and it actually defeaned everyone’s ears until they hurt!

Su Wen was so scared that he trembled. For a moment, he didn’t dare to vent his anger.

“He’s in... in the room. Why are you shouting?” Su Wen mumbled timidly.

Hearing this, Qin Yu hurriedly walked into the room.

In the room, Old Mister Su was lying on the bed alone.

No one from the Su family came to take care of him.

Qin Yu quickly walked over. He squatted in front of Old Mister Su and said with some sadness, “Grandpa, you...”

Before he could finish, Old Mister Su waved his hand.

He said with a trembling voice, “Qin Yu, I... don’t have much longer to live. Before I die, I wanted to see you again...”

Qin Yu suddenly felt sad from the bottom of his heart. In the entire Su family, only Old Mister Su treated Qin Yu as a human.

After they lived together for so many years, it was impossible to say that they didn’t have affection for each other.

Old Mister Su was surrounded by a deathly aura.

The density of the death aura had already exceeded Qin Yu’s imagination.

This was clearly a sign of death.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He raised his hand and placed it in front of Old Mister Su. He poured the spiritual energy in his body into Old Mister Su’s body.

Unfortunately, Old Mister Su’s illness was already beyond cure. He was on the brink of death. Even Qin Yu had no way to save him.

Old Mister Su said with difficulty, “Don’t waste your energy... Qin Yu, I know that the Su family has let you down. Can you give the Su family a way out on account of me...”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel stunned. In fact, Qin Yu had thought of wiping out the Su family.

“Promise me...” Old Mister Su, his tone imploring, grabbed Qin Yu’s wrist tightly.

Qin Yu couldn’t bear to let him down.

He took a deep breath and nodded. “Grandfather, I promise you. As long as the Su family doesn’t provoke me, I can give the Su family a way out.”

Hearing this, Old Mister Su slowly said, “Then I’m relieved, relieved...”

As he spoke, Old Mister Su’s internal qi became weaker and weaker until it completely disappeared.

He laid on the bed and didn’t move anymore.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little sorrowful.

There were so many people in the Su family, but the one who guarded the dying Old Mister Su was actually an outsider. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“These people are really disgusting.” Qin Yu heard the commotion in the living room, and his expression couldn’t help but turn cold.

He turned his head and walked out of Old Mister Su’s room, all the way to the living room.

After they saw Qin Yu, the room immediately became quiet.

“Finished seeing him? You can go now.” Sun Yumei snorted lightly.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “Old Mister Su has died. I will leave after he is buried.”

“D*mn, he finally left. He dragged it out for so long.” Su Wen’s brother, Su Wu, couldn’t help but grumble.

“Alright, alright. It wasn’t easy for us to gather together. After dad is buried, we should have a good drink!” Su Wen said with a smile.

“That’s for sure. How long has it been since the two of us last saw each other? It’s been more than ten years since I went to the provincial capital, right?”

The whole family began to chat. No one cared about Old Mister Su’s death at all.

Qin Yu sat silently at the side. He closed his eyes and tried his best to calm himself down.

At this moment, a young man suddenly walked in from the door.

The young man was about the same age as Qin Yu, and there was a gallant look to him.

“Gee, Xiao Bo, you’re finally back!” Upon seeing this young man, everyone in the room quickly stood up to welcome him.

The young man called Xiao Bo nodded slightly and said indifferently, “Yep, I had a mission, so I came back a little late.”

“Gee, it’s okay. You should attend to your business first.” Su Wen said eagerly.

Then, Su Wen asked tentatively, “Xiao Bo, your position in the military district shouldn’t be low right now, right?”

Su Bo glanced at him and said indifferently, “Yep, I have a three-stroke armband.”

“Three!” Upon hearing this, everyone gasped!

“Gee, Xiao Bo is really promising!”

“We have to count on Xiao Bo in the future!”

At this time, Su Bo’s father, Su Wu, deliberately asked, “Xiao Bo, why are there so many soldiers coming to Jiangcheng recently? Is there some big shot coming?”

Su Bo nodded slightly and said, “Yes, the Deputy Chief of the Chuzhou region will come to Jiangcheng in the next few days.”

“Deputy Chief?” Hearing this, everyone was even more shocked!

That was a big shot with a high position and power!

“Why would such a big shot come to Jiangcheng?” Su Wen asked in surprise.

Su Bo said, “I heard that it’s to recruit someone. skilled in medicine and martial arts, but I don’t know who exactly he is.”

“D*mn, who is so capable to even have the vice-chief come and invite him?” The people in the room immediately buzzed with discussion.

While everyone was discussing, Su Bo suddenly noticed Qin Yu, who sitting wasn’t far away.

He frowned slightly and then casually asked, “Who is that person?”

Everyone immediately looked at Qin Yu, who wasn’t far away.

“He is your sister’s ex-husband and had married into the Su family. Now that he has been chased out, he is just a loser. There is no need to pay attention to him,” Su Wen snorted and said.

Su Bo’s expression immediately became a little unhappy. Someone like that was actually putting on airs? Why was he still sitting there when he saw him?

Thinking of this, Su Bo immediately walked towards Qin Yu.

“Don’t you know to get up and welcome me when you see me coming? Why, is your butt exceptionally heavy?” Su Bo said with a cold expression.

Hearing this, Qin Yu slowly opened his eyes.

He glanced at Su Bo and frowned. “Welcome you? Who do you think you are to let me welcome you?”
