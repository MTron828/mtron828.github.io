Chapter 995: Chapter 995, tie Dan made his move

“Hahahaha!”Zeng ji laughed even more arrogantly when he heard this.

The ear-piercing voice made Qin Yu’s ears hurt.

“Tie Dan, Can you shut him up?”Qin Yu frowned and asked.

Tie Dan smiled coldly and said, “Of course, as long as you give me your body, I will shut him up immediately...”

“Okay,”Qin Yu agreed and then closed his eyes slightly.

In an instant, tie Dan’s divine sense took over Qin Yu’s body.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s temperament became a little different.

A sinister and cruel smile hung on the corner of his mouth, and the corners of his tongue would occasionally curl up, making him look like a perverted murderer.

Zeng Ji, who was not far away, was still laughing crazily without understanding the situation.

The ear-piercing sound was unbearable.

“Bang!”

At this moment, Qin Yu’s figure suddenly disappeared!

In just a breath’s time, he had arrived in front of Zeng Ji!

“What?”Zeng Ji’s face changed, and a trace of fear flashed in his eyes!

“Bang!”

Before Zeng Ji could react, tie Dan’s fist had already smashed into Zeng Ji’s mouth!

Zeng Ji’s body instantly soared into the air!

His jaw bone was directly smashed into pieces!

Looking at his body flying high into the air, iron egg took a deep breath.

“Hahahaha!”

Then, Iron Egg’s unbridled laughter was heard.

“This is the feeling of being alive... so cool...”iron egg licked his lips.

Everyone was dumbfounded.

Especially Yu Qin.

Was this still the Qin Yu that they knew? Why did he look like a different person?

Especially the bewitching smile on his face, which made people feel a little strange and terrifying...

“Bang!”

Soon, Zeng Ji’s body fell to the ground.

He hurriedly got up from the ground and stared at tie Dan in front of him.

“Qin Yu, how Dare You Sneak Attack Me!”Zeng ji shouted angrily.

Tie Dan grinned and sneered, “Sneak Attack You? You’re just a maggot. Do I need to sneak attack you?”

“Maggot? I’m a Maggot? !”Zeng Ji was instantly enraged.

“Qin Yu, I think you’ve gone mad! Did you gain confidence from the last fight?”Zeng Ji said with a cold face.

Tie Dan ignored Zeng Ji’s words and glanced at the remaining martial saints.

“All of you, attack together...”Tie Dan said darkly.

Zeng ji shouted loudly, “Attack together! Don’t give him any chance to escape!”

The three Martial Saints stepped out in unison! A terrifying pressure instantly filled the air!

“Kid, today you...”

“Bang!”

Before that martial saint could finish speaking, tie Dan had already closed in on him and smashed a straight fist onto his face.

His already ugly face instantly exploded!

“Do you think I’ll listen to your nonsense?”Tie Dan licked his lips.

Before everyone could be shocked, tie Dan made another crazy move.

He directly took out his opponent’s primordial spirit and swallowed it in one gulp.

Everyone’s expressions were extremely ugly!

Especially Zeng Ji! The sweat on his forehead kept flowing down!

“This kid... Why does he look like a different person?”Ceng Ji roared in his heart!

He didn’t even let him finish his words before he attacked? !

“It’s your turn.”Tie Dan looked at the other martial saint.

That martial saint took two steps back and looked at tie Dan in front of him nervously. He braced himself and said, “Let me tell you, I...”

“Whoosh!”

Another punch directly pierced through his chest!

“It seems like you don’t know me very well.”Tie Dan raised his head to look at the martial saint in front of him and grinned.

“This is how I do things. I’m clean, fast, accurate, and ruthless! That’s why I’m the number one killer! Do you understand?”Tie Dan said in a soft voice.

This seemingly “Gentle”voice sounded as terrifying as a life-threatening talisman in everyone’s ears!

He had used the same method to kill two martial saints in the blink of an eye!

Not only was tie Dan extremely powerful, but he also did things cleanly and without any hesitation!

Even Qin Yu’s impression of Tie Dan had changed!

Zeng Ji’s expression was extremely cold. He took two steps back and said coldly, “Qin Yu, I think we can talk.”

“Talk about your father!”

Tie Dan approached him and kicked Zeng Ji’s lower abdomen!

Although Zeng Ji had used a protective spell, he was still sent flying by tie Dan’s kick!

Before Zeng Ji could get up, tie Dan approached him again.

He grabbed Zeng Ji’s hair, bent his knees, and slammed them hard on Zeng Ji’s lower abdomen!

Then, tie Dan grabbed Zeng Ji’s hands together and hammered Zeng Ji’s spine!

Crack

Zeng Ji’s spine was shattered instantly! His body was smashed into the ground!

Iron Egg squatted down. He grabbed Zeng Ji’s hair with one hand and lifted him up.

“You’re awesome,”iron egg said while patting Zeng Ji’s face.

Zeng Ji opened his mouth and found it difficult to speak.

Why did he look like a fucking gangster fighting? !

“I’ll give you a chance. Tell me your last words.”Tie Dan grabbed Zeng Ji’s hair and said.

“You must cherish this opportunity. Ordinary people don’t have this kind of treatment.”

Zeng Ji opened his mouth and was about to speak.

At this moment, tie Dan waved his hand and said, “You speak too slowly. Hurry up and die.”

After he finished speaking, tie Dan stepped on Zeng Ji’s head and crushed it.

He had killed three martial saints in one breath. Everyone was dumbstruck.

The remaining two martial marquis were still trying to escape. Naturally, tie Dan would not give them a chance.

He kicked a rock under his foot and dashed towards the two people. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The rock seemed to contain a tremendous force and instantly took the lives of the two people.

After killing these people, tie Dan said with a comfortable expression, “It’s been a long time since I’ve killed someone... This is the feeling! This is the feeling that I’m infatuated with!”

Then, iron egg looked at Yu Qin who was not far away.

“Qin Yu, can I discuss something with you?”Iron Egg said with a smile.

“What is it?”Qin Yu asked.

Iron Egg licked his lips and said, “I think this Yu Qin is quite interested in you. Anyway, you don’t like her, so why don’t I help you?”

“Help me? What do you mean?”Qin Yu said with some confusion.

Tie Dan said with a smile, “Of course, I slept with her! I’m afraid you don’t know that other than the number one killer, I have another identity, the number one pervert!”

“Hehe... I believe that with your body, she won’t Refuse Me...”

With that, tie Dan used Qin Yu’s body and walked toward Yu Qin with a smile.
