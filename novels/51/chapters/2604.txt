Chapter 2605: Life and Death on the Chessboard

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“You guys also chose the mysterious one?”

Li Yue frowned and asked as he could guess from their expressions.

“Looks like the price is this tremendously dangerous mission, but that’s good.

Without this mission, we can’t enter the bunker.”

Li Yue spoke softly, and Qin Yu stared at him with increasing astonishment.

Every word he said was incredibly accurate and hit the key points precisely as if he had the perspective of a god.

“Did you obtain the Order of the Way? Or did you obtain a seed with some kind of ability? Can you tell me in detail? This will make me trust you more.”

Qin Yu suddenly interrupted Lu Yue’s thoughts. He stared at this person.

But now, it was just as Li Yue had said. Tonight, going to investigate the enemy camp was almost a life-threatening situation. He was willing to cooperate unconditionally if the person before him could find the right path.

“The Order of Rules I obtained is a chessboard. The internal qi of everyone and items that come into contact with me will enter my chessboard and be deduced. The red resolution represents survival, and the black outcome represents death. Of course, the additional different factors will change the outcome of this chessboard.”

Li Yue raised his hand, and a small chessboard appeared in his palm.

After that, balls of light of different colors appeared on everyone’s bodies and uncontrollably entered the chessboard.

Following that, light balls of different shapes also entered the chessboard.

“The round ball of light represents you guys’ physical fitness, the square represents the Order of the Rules you have mastered, and the triangle represents your combat ability. These are added to deduce the outcome at the end, but this outcome may not be accurate. It can only be a reference for probability.”

Li Yue used both hands to pull the light spots.

“Immortal Emperor Yao, is there such Order of the Way?”

Qin Yu frowned and asked.

“The Order of the Rules in the Saint Kingdom falls in myriad ways, and various unexpected abilities can be found. It’s a power similar to the ability of Daoist deduction, but the accuracy isn’t very high. Whether it’s accurate or not depends on your luck.”

Immortal Emperor Yao laughed strangely and said.

“Tonight, we will be traveling with the scout team. If we follow the rules, it will not be difficult for us to reach the red outcome. However, if we want to take this opportunity to gain military merits and get a chance to enter the bunker, we will need you guys’ help.”

Li Yue stared at the other ten people.

“The things that I need you to exchange for, I’ll help you exchange them back if Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

I have military merits in the Holy Region after entering the bunker tonight.’

“I’m sorry, I don’t believe in your chessboard.”

One of them turned around and walked out.

“The main force of the head-on battle is not us, but the human race army here. We don’t have to face the enemy head-on. If we can survive, the power of annihilation might not target outsiders like us. I’m sorry, I need these resources. ”

Another person shook his head.

Qin Yu shook his head. Everything Li Yue said was very logical.

Moreover, he had the chessboard in his hand, but even if these people were all of the human race, it was challenging to pull them together.

Everyone here had the potential to become the scion of the Saint Kingdom. Why should they hand over what they had risked their lives to obtain?

These items exchanged with military merits could be the key to their survival in the final battle.

“A bunch of idiots.

Li Yue shook his head.

“Senior Brother Qin Yu, this is the bottle of Spirit Strengthening Pills that I exchanged for.”

Shen Qian walked over and placed a bottle of pills in Qin Yu’s hands. “Senior Brother Qin Yu, this is a bottle of Energy Recovery Pills. Be careful tonight! ”

A young man walked to Qin Yu’s side.

“Who are you ?”

“Senior Brother, I am Bufan of the Earth generation from the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect. After the great battle, I was fortunate enough to be chosen by Master’s divine flame to come here.”

Bufan said softly. He had seen that great battle and remembered how Qin Yu had risked his life with the three sects.

Therefore, he had complete trust in Qin Yu.

“Thank you, Junior Brother and Junior Sister. If I can come back alive tonight, I’ll definitely pay you back double.”

Qin Yu cupped his fists solemnly.

It was truly rare to find a benefactor who extended help in time of need. Qin Yu truly appreciated the bond of friendship that he received assistance at this moment.

They looked at the others, but they did not respond.

Qin Yu sighed softly. However, he felt that it was very normal. He would probably make the same decision if he were in their position.

“In the case of five of us, we might have a chance. We’ll have to see what kind of mission it is specifically.”

Li Yue sighed lightly. His chessboard found out these people had exchanged for some good things.

These intense lights might turn their outcome red at the end, but they were unwilling to take it out. Under the rules here, they could not forcefully snatch it.

“Moreover, there might be more variables. This doesn’t seem to be the outcome at the end.”

Li Yue stared at the chessboard in his hand and said softly.

A few of them sat silently in the general’s residence and waited for the notice. It was meaningless to escape in this place.

The soldiers of the commando team were much stronger than them, and it was impossible to escape in their territory.

Qin Yu, on the other hand, was immersed in the cultivation of the Order of Reflection.

After killing Yin Lin, he now had a vast amount of the soul’s Saint Power stored in his body and thus was not afraid of consumption during training. If he could practice and master it, it would lead him to a significant enhancement in his combat strength.

After waiting for an unknown duration, Qin Yu practiced until mentally exhausted.

Finally, the general’s command arrived.

“Gather all the outsiders again and organize another round of scouts to prepare for the battle two days later.”

A cold voice said. Not long after, those outsiders who had already left returned to the general’s residence. Most of them had blank expressions, not knowing why they had been summoned again.

“Brother, why did the military order change?”

Ju Wuwei asked in a deep voice.

“The three elite scout squads that set off yesterday were all killed. Not a single one of them survived. This has never happened before, and the general suspects that the enemy has deployed something in the local formation, which is why they relentlessly hunted our scout squads.” The soldier said in a deep voice.

“How is the combat strength of the scout team?”

Lu Yue asked another crucial question.

“The elite scout team consists of the elites of the commando team. Stop asking questions now and follow me to collect the equipment of the scouts. We will then set off immediately. We must investigate the situation before the battle.”

Qin Yu’s heart sank. After killing Yin Lin, his strength should be about the same as the soldiers of the commando team.

However, there was a high chance that they could not win against the elites. Almost all three teams of elite scouts were gone. Qin Yu took a deep breath.

Soon, everyone received their equipment at the foot of the city. They received three Energy Recovery Pills, a cloak, and a mirror..
