Chapter 1741: Yuan Xiu vs The Divine Inscription Formation

Everyone in the North Plain had served Yuan Xiu for many years. No one had expected that the first thing he would do after his complete resurrection was to kill everyone!

Such a vicious person simply left one speechless!

The entire North Plain had turned into a desolate land.

In the vast world, only Yuan Xiu stood.

!!

He scanned his surroundings coldly as if he was the master of this world.

“A bunch of trash. They’ve finally disappeared.” Yuan Xiu said coldly.

He clenched his fist lightly, and a terrifying power instantly burst out from the center of his fist!

With Yuan Xiu as the center, countless cracks shot out into the distance!

No one could match such a terrifying power!

“Xiao Sheng, I’m here.” Yuan Xiu’s voice was bone-chillingly cold, and no one dared to ignore it.

The sky finally brightened.

On this day, everyone’s hearts were at their throats.

Dayue Mountain.

Qin Yu and Wen Wanchong were waiting for the news.

Their faces were filled with worry.

“When are you guys leaving? I want to go too!” Jue Wu jumped in front of the two of them and waved her little fists.

Qin Yu glanced at her and shook her head. “No, you can’t. You’ll stay at Dayue Mountain. You won’t be of any help.”

Although this statement was rather hurtful, it was indeed so.

Jue Wu glared at Qin Yu and said, “You little bastard, you’ve grown your wings, haven’t you? You actually dare to say I’m useless?”

Wen Wanchong smiled bitterly. “Lord Jue Wu, Qin Yu is telling the truth. Even a Reversion Void Stage cultivator might not be able to help. Let alone…”

“Tsk, what’s so amazing about the Reversion Void Stage? I can do it at any time!” Jue Wu waved her little fists and said.

“Then we’ll talk about it after you reach the Reversion Void Stage,” Qin Yu said with a cold expression. “Before that, you’d better stay here obediently.”

“Y-y-you!” Jue Wu pointed at Qin Yu, her face full of anger.

She didn’t expect that everything would change after she woke up from her sleep.

“Where should we go now?” Wen Wanchong asked.

“I don’t know either. No one knows where Yuan Xiu will go. Let me think about it,” Qin Yu shook his head.

Wen Wanchong nodded and did not say anything more.

Qin Yu touched his chin and thought carefully.

Qu Zhu, who was far away at Fengzhu Mountain, seemed to be considering this question as well.

He had made full preparations for this battle.

Even though he might not be able to force Yuan Xiu to retreat, he had no choice but to try.

“I know.”

At this moment, Qu Zhu of Fengzhu Mountain and Qin Yu of Dayue Mountain said the same thing at the same time.

“I’m afraid that the current Yuan Xiu will seek out Xiao Sheng.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“Where is Xiao Sheng now?” Wen Wanchong asked with a frown.

“The Divine Capital City.” Qin Yu said coldly.

Then, Qin Yu looked at Wen Wanchong and said, “Let’s go to the Divine Capital City immediately.”

After that, Qin Yu summoned the Divine Eagle and rushed to Divine Capital City with Wen Wanchong.

“You guys really won’t bring me along?” Jue Wu looked a little wronged.

Qin Yu glanced at her and sighed, “When you reach the Reversion Void Stage, you can easily deal with Yuan Xiu. There’s no need for you to throw your life away now.”

After saying that, Qin Yu wasted no more time and immediately rushed to Divine Capital City.

Divine Capital City.

He Teng, Sima Bei, and Yong Ji had spent several days trying to break this Divine Inscription Formation, but they were still unable to do so.

The Divine Inscription Formation looked weak, but it was indestructible. In front of it, all other techniques were not worth mentioning.

“Today is the resurrection day, right?” at this moment, He Teng suddenly spoke.

“Mm,” Sima Bei said, “If nothing unexpected happens, the Lord has already been resurrected.”

“Then he should be arriving here with his army soon.” Yong Ji speculated.

He Teng sneered. “I’m afraid he’ll come by himself. How can there be an army? ”

“What do you mean by that?” Sima Bei and Yong Ji looked at He Teng in unison.

He Teng did not explain.

He was a treacherous and vicious person, so he naturally understood Yuan Xiu.

As time passed, the three of them spared no effort in attacking Divine Capital City.

Even though Divine Capital City looked like it was in shambles, the gates were not open.

“There’s no other way,” He Teng spread out his hands, appearing rather helpless.

“I wonder when the Lord will descend.” Yong Ji frowned.

Just as he said that, a figure broke through the air and arrived!

He directly tore open the void in front of him and appeared in front of them!

This person was no other than Yuan Xiu!

The three of them were stunned for a moment before they hurriedly knelt on the ground!

What was more terrifying was that they could not detect Yuan Xiu’s aura at all!

His strength was clearly so terrifying that it made people’s hearts palpitate, but no one was able to detect his arrival!

“Lord!” Sima Bei shouted, “You’ve finally come back to life! ”

Yuan Xiu swept his cold gaze across the few of them and said,”Where’s Xiao Sheng?”

“Lord, he is in Divine Capital City, but we can’t enter.” Sima Bei answered honestly.

Yuan Xiu’s expression was extremely cold, and a murderous aura was emitted from him.

At this moment, Yuan Xiu actually had the intention to kill the three of them! Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

This killing intent was something that anyone could clearly sense!

“Lord, this Divine Inscription Formation was left behind by an expert. It’s not something that we can break…” Sima Bei explained hurriedly.

Yuan Xiu glanced at him and coldly said, “Trash, I knew you wouldn’t be able to do anything. I’ll spare your lives for now.”

The three of them heaved a sigh of relief.

They hurriedly stood up and looked behind Yuan Xiu.

Sure enough, just as He Teng had expected, there was no one else besides Yuan Xiu.

“Lord, why are you alone?” Sima Bei asked, puzzled.

Yuan Xiu glanced at Sima Bei and suddenly slapped him in the air!

Although the force of this slap was not great, it still shattered half of Sima Bei’s face!

For a moment, Sima Bei looked extremely terrifying. Half of his face was exposed, and he looked like a half-dead person!

Sima Bei didn’t dare to show any resentment. He quickly bent down, as if to express his apology.

“Are you sure Xiao Sheng is in this city?” Yuan Xiu asked coldly.

“I’m sure. Qin Yu has indeed brought Xiao Sheng here!” Sima Bei said hurriedly.

Yuan Xiu said no more. He slowly raised his palm, and a terrifying aura instantly condensed in his palm!

Very quickly, a gigantic heavenly ax was formed in Yuan Xiu’s hand!

It was another ancient magical artifact! Compared to the techniques he had cast last time, this one was many times more powerful!

Even Yong Ji and the others felt their hearts palpitate!

Yuan Xiu gripped the gigantic heavenly ax and pressed it down lightly.

In an instant, the heavens and earth cracked as countless divine divine inscriptions appeared in the sky above Divine Capital City and met the gigantic heavenly ax!

An extremely terrifying sound exploded in the sky at this moment!
