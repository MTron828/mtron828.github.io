Chapter 1504: Chapter 1,504, plea for mercy 1

Qin Yu’s entire body was covered in mist, and under the protection of the power of Heaven and earth, he appeared extremely mysterious.

His bone-chilling battle intent made people not dare to look at him. Even the first elder was panicking at this moment.

Qin Yu sat on two dragon vein of Yin. One looked at the eighteen gods, and the other headed straight for the first elder.

The first Elder’s expression was extremely ugly. Although the virtual entity in his hand could still be used, it was insignificant in front of the dragon vein of Yin.

“Die!”

Qin Yu shouted. His left hand rolled, and the dragon vein of Yin instantly rushed out and headed straight for the first elder!

“Eighteen gods, save me!”The first elder shouted in Panic!

The eighteen gods who had received the order instantly arrived in front of the first elder. His entire body was wrapped in divine aura, and he planned to take this attack head-on.

“It’s useless even if you come!”Qin Yu roared angrily, and two dragon vein yin energies shot out at the same time!

The Dragon’s roar pierced through the heaven and earth, and a thick power gushed out.

With the two dragon vein yin energies stacked together, even the eighteen gods wouldn’t be able to do anything!

Boom

At the moment of contact, a ripple-like internal Qi spread out in all directions. It was an extremely beautiful sight.

......

Countless mountain peaks had been flattened at this moment. More than half of the Yin Palace had become bald, as if someone had shaved off their hair.

The bodies of the eighteen gods were sent flying, and cracks appeared on their bodies one after another!

“Old Dog, die!”

Qin Yu roared angrily, and the dragon vein in his hand shot out towards the first elder!

At this critical moment, the first elder’s body shone with an extremely dazzling radiance.

This was a protective technique that the sect master had set up for him, and it was able to protect his life.

The dragon vein struck straight towards the sect master’s chest, and the protective technique collapsed in an instant. The remaining force crashed into the first Elder’s chest, breaking his ribs in an instant!

The so-called protective technique was actually so weak in front of the dragon vein!

“Pu!”

Blood spurted out of the first elder’s mouth, and his chest caved in!

At this moment, the first elder was completely flustered. He had used all of his internal QI, but he still couldn’t stop Qin Yu’s killing!

“Old Dog, today is the day you die. Die with Zhen Yue!”Qin Yu roared and took a step forward. At this moment, the Heaven and earth moved!

The first elder’s internal Qi caused his entire body to tremble. His pupils constricted as he stared at Qin Yu, as if he was waiting for death to descend.

Buzz

At the critical moment, the eighteen gods stood out once again and blocked Qin Yu.

However, after withstanding this attack, the eighteen gods could no longer maintain their eighteen incarnations and returned to their original forms.

The 18 gods stood in different positions, looking at Qin Yu with cold eyes.

Their bodies had received different injuries, and drops of blood flowed down.

Qin Yu shouted, “Old dog, let’s see who can save you now!”

As he spoke, Qin Yu stepped forward again!

Two yin-dragon vein turned the sky and earth upside down, slamming towards the first elder!

But at this moment, golden light suddenly flashed between the first elder’s brows, and in the next second, a large hand stretched out!

The large hand met the Yin dragon vein, producing a violent collision!

“Bang!”

Under this collision, the first elder was directly sent flying, and more than half of his body was shattered. It was a tragic sight.

And the owner of that large hand was actually the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect!

He was dressed in long clothes, floating in the air, looking at Qin Yu with a calm expression. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Sect master, save me!”The first elder was like a dog with a broken back, kneeling on the ground and repeatedly begging for mercy.

First Elder ignored first elder, but looked at Qin Yu and said quietly, “This matter, let’s end it here.”

“End it here? You said this is the end?”Qin Yu berated coldly.

“You really take this old dog seriously. Even your own son didn’t have so many backup plans, right?”

First Elder frowned slightly. His rather handsome face seemed to be somewhat unhappy.

Then, the sect master looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “You’ve killed my son. What else do you want?”

Qin Yu pointed at the first elder and said coldly, “I want him to die with Zhen Yue. He must die!”

“You can’t kill him,”the sect master said coldly.

Qin Yu sneered, “Then let’s try!”

If it was the sect master’s real body, Qin Yu might be afraid.

However, this was just a shadow. Qin Yu had two dragon vein of Yin, so how could he be afraid!

Just as Qin Yu was about to activate the dragon vein of Yin, another person rushed to the scene.

“Qin Yu, stop.”

Looking Up, it was actually Mr. Yongji!

He appeared here with two disciples.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and sneered, “Mr. Yongji, why? Do you also want to interfere in this matter?”

Yongji said indifferently, “I saved your life once, and I saved his life today. How about it?”

This made Qin Yu somewhat puzzled.

It was said that Mr. Yongji coveted the heavenly cloud sect. Wasn’t the death of the first elder a good thing for him? Why did he have to come out to protect him?

“Give me face, how about it?”Mr. Yongji continued to ask.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No, I said that he must die. If you want to interfere, then do it.”

“Qin Yu, don’t be so Shameless!”The disciple beside Yong Ji shouted.

Qin Yu’s eyes were like lightning as he coldly looked at that disciple.

“You can also do it together,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Seeing this, Yong Ji couldn’t help but sigh and said, “Qin Yu, why don’t we talk in private?”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He looked at Yong Ji warily.

Yong ji smiled and said, “You control the yin-dragon vein, so why are you afraid of Me? Besides, I don’t want to hurt you.”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and then said coldly, “Just say what you want to say.”

Yong Ji didn’t say anything. He used his divine sense to transmit his voice, “Qin Yu, if you kill the first elder, who will be in charge of the Heavenly Cloud Sect? Have you thought about it?”

“What does it have to do with me?”Qin Yu sneered.

Yong Ji said in a deep voice, “If the first elder dies, the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect will definitely come out of seclusion! When that time comes, who will be able to deal with the Heavenly Cloud sect! How will you protect yourself?”

“I can tell you clearly that if the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect is determined to kill you, no one in the entire South Province will be able to save you!”

These words reminded Qin Yu that the first Elder was an idiot. It was indeed good news that he was in charge of the Heavenly Cloud sect.

However... Qin Yu had waited for so long just to kill this first elder. Now that he was asked to give up, how could he endure it.

“Let him go. I guarantee that the Heavenly Cloud sect will not find trouble with you,”the sect master said coldly.

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely ugly. Seeing that his enemy was right in front of him, he could not kill him at all.

This feeling made Qin Yu extremely uncomfortable.

“Qin Yu, if I wanted to kill you, you would have died long ago! Don’t you understand!”The sect master suddenly shouted.

“Do you really think that the heavenly cloud sect will not be able to get rid of you? ! Today, you let him go as a return of my favor.”The sect master continued.
