Chapter 1274: Chapter 1,274, the arrival of the Heavenly Cloud sect 

Jin Lun was extremely powerful, and he even had the attitude of looking down on the team leader.

He sat down in front of the team leader and said coldly, “Team leader, you’d better not cover up for him. This is between him and me. Moreover, there is always a challenge between the hunters.”

The team leader was not in a hurry. He smiled and said, “It’s not that I’m covering up for him. It’s just that it’s too unfortunate. He just happened to be out shopping. I’m afraid he won’t be back for a while.”

“Shopping?”Jin Lun’s face darkened and he said coldly, “I thought he was some kind of character. Turns out he’s a coward.”

The team leader spread his hands. He did not care what Jin Lun said. As long as the two of them did not quarrel, it was enough.

Then, Jin Lun continued, “There’s no rush. I’ll wait for him to come back here.”

The team leader frowned slightly and said, “This... I’m afraid he won’t be back for a while.”

“If he doesn’t come back for a day, I’ll wait for him for a day. If he doesn’t come back for a year, I’ll wait for him for a year. If he doesn’t come back, then forget it. Just treat it as if he left the hunter organization,”Jin Lun said coldly.

After saying this, Jin Lun turned around and left.

The team leader wanted to persuade him, but in the end, he shook his head helplessly.

He knew Jin Lun’s temper very well. More importantly, he was the guardian of the Order of the hunter organization, so he would never do anything against the order.

Because he knew very well in his heart that once the order of the organization was violated, the organization would quickly disintegrate.

This was also the reason why he had to confront Jing Bai earlier.

On the other side.

Qin Yu and Guan Zhuang were rushing towards Gu City.

Gu city was the closest city to the hunter organization. It was no exaggeration to say that it was the hub of the hunter organization to the outside world.

Therefore, Gu city was extremely lively, and there were countless people who came to search for treasures.

Along the way, Qin Yu’s mind was filled with the life energy.

He could not wait to get the life energy and recover his spiritual power.

With his current state of mind, as long as he recovered his spiritual power, he could not help but burst out with unimaginable combat strength, and his realm would also increase accordingly.

The two of them spent three days before they finally reached the vicinity of Gu City.

The entire journey was practically a desert. Looking at the city that stood out in the distance, Qin Yu couldn’t help but wipe away his sweat.

“It’s so damn far away,”Qin Yu muttered.

The holy region was too vast. On the map, Gu City and the hunter organization seemed to be next to each other, but it actually took them three whole days to walk.

“There’s nothing we can do. After all, our southern region can’t be compared to the central region. We don’t have their extensive teleportation formation,”Guan Zhuang said.

The city in front of them was extremely huge. The first thing that came into view was the thick city walls.

The huge golden words on the city gate were extremely dazzling.

It was as if the two worlds were separated by this wall.

Qin Yu followed behind Guan Zhuang and stepped into the city.

As soon as he entered the city, Qin Yu felt that something was wrong.

Although the entire city was extremely prosperous, there was an inexplicable sense of oppression.

This feeling was extremely strange. It was as if he had stepped into an ancient city, causing fear in people’s hearts.

Guan Zhuang saw Qin Yu’s confusion and said, “There is a mountain protection formation left behind here. The outside world is bestowed by the Tianyun sect, but in fact, we all know that the Tianyun sect doesn’t have that much ability.”

Qin Yu looked at Guan Zhuang and asked with his eyes.

Guan Zhuang snorted lightly and said, “This city has existed for God knows how many years. The formation was naturally left behind by the previous city Lord. It has nothing to do with the Tianyun sect.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly.

The holy region was a place where geniuses competed. God knows how many great cultivators at the Tribulation Stage had appeared.

The treasures left behind by them were naturally countless and mysterious.

As far as the eye could see, the entire GU city seemed extremely prosperous. There were people hawking almost everywhere.

Compared to the city where the Tianyun sect was located, it was not much different. However, the prices were much cheaper. After all, the hunter organization was next door.

“Let’s go. I’ll bring you around first.”Guan Zhuang’s huge palm patted Qin Yu’s shoulder.

Under Guan Zhuang’s lead, Qin Yu came to the largest market in Gu City.

In this market, there was almost everything.

Whether it was weapons, herbs, or all kinds of treasures, they could be seen here.

Other than that, there were also many delicacies that could not be named.

In such a bustling area, high officials and nobles could naturally be seen everywhere. On both sides of the market, there were heavy guards.

They were subordinate to the city lord, and each of them had extraordinary strength. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The two of them walked around the market for a day and were in a good mood. They also bought a lot of strange and strange gadgets.

However, these things didn’t mean much to Qin Yu. For a workaholic like Qin Yu, he soon lost interest.

“Big Brother Guan Zhuang, do you think there is life energy here?”Qin Yu asked curiously.

“You are really persistent about life energy,”Guan Zhuang said helplessly.

Qin Yu did not explain, because the life energy was too important to him.

“Even if there is, you can’t afford it.”Guan Zhuang shook his head.

Qin Yu opened his mouth but did not say anything.

To Qin Yu, as long as there was life energy, it was worth the risk. At most, he would just snatch it and run away.

“Let’s go. I’ll bring you to a place where we might be able to get some information.”Guan Zhuang patted Qin Yu’s shoulder.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Thank you.”

At this moment, there was a sudden movement in the sky.

Looking up, they saw several extremely huge demonic beasts whizzing past in the sky.

There were a few people standing on the demonic beasts with a cold expression.

The one leading them was a young youth. Although he had a delicate and pretty appearance, there was a coldness between his brows that did not belong to his age.

“It’s the people from the Heavenly Cloud sect. Why are they here?”Guan Zhuang frowned and muttered.

Meanwhile, Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly. His eyes could not help but stare at that youth.

“Is he that genius from the Heavenly Cloud Sect?”Qin Yu whispered to himself.

“I didn’t expect them to find us so quickly.”

This speed was much faster than Qin Yu had imagined.
