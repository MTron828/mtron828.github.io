2334 The Nine Great Aristocratic Families’ Decision

However, the terrifying power that brushed past him somewhat shocked him.

Not to mention that he had used up almost half of his strength to throw this punch.

“But it doesn’t matter. My punch has severely injured this guy, so I can still absorb a portion of his cosmic luck. Still, I’ve gained something this time and almost destroyed 80% of his soul power with this punch. How is he going to counter the Vermilion Bird’s wrath?”

Hua Tian formed a hand seal and smiled.

…

In Solitary Cloud City, Jue Wu brought Qin Yu back to the Moon Listening Pavilion.

“Quickly save him!”

Jue Wu’s eyes brimmed with tears as she shouted at Ji Yue.

Xiaoru and Little Fatty also surrounded Qin Yu and continuously injected the spiritual energy of their bodies into Qin Yu’s.

“He actually succeeded? Don’t worry. I’ll invite the best pharmacist from the Moon Listening Pavilion over now.”

Ji Yue was in disbelief. It took her a while to realize that she was not dreaming.

Qin Yu had indeed obtained the blood essence from the Vermilion Bird and removed the curse of the Nirvana Body.

“Boom!”

As soon as Xiaoru’s and Little Fatty’s internal qi approached Qin Yu, a ball of flames was absorbed.

In an instant, the bones of Qin Yu’s leg exploded, and a terrifying heat wave erupted from his body.

“Stop!”

A middle-aged man in a green robe with a gloomy expression appeared beside Qin Yu.

He stopped Xiaoru and Little Fatty and slapped the ball of fire with his palm.

“Are you f*cking courting death?”

Jue Wu roared and grabbed his neck.

“Stop! Look at Qin Yu’s body.”

Ji Yue hurriedly blocked Jue Wu.

Under that attack, that flame was finally extinguished, and the heat wave emitted also ceased.

“Cough, cough, cough! Let go, let go.”

The middle-aged man coughed violently. Only then did Jue Wu react and quickly let go of down.

“I’m sorry, Sir. Please save him!”

Jue Wu hurriedly apologized.

“As you said, the remaining Vermillion Bird’s flame is destroying his body. Any spiritual energy or medicinal qi that enters his body will only be blocked by the Vermillion Bird’s flame, and his soul will also be severely injured.”

The middle-aged man shook his head.

“Mr. Wu, is there any way to solve this?”Ji Yue bit her lips, seemingly unwilling to give up.

The young man before them had created so many miracles. Was he going to die here? Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“It’s already a miracle that he’s still alive. The flame of the Vermilion Bird in his body can absorb all the spiritual energy. Therefore, all the spiritual energy that enters his body will be absorbed by the flame of the Vermilion Bird and then destroy his body crazily if we can’t get rid of the flame.”

Mr. Wu shook his head.

“He can only rely on himself.”

At this moment, Qin Yu was also in despair. Initially, he could still try to fight with the remaining breath in his body by relying on the power of divine sense. However, he did not expect Hua Tian to ambush him.

His soul had been severely injured once again, and the flame of the Vermillion Bird in his body was now crazily destroying his vitality.

Soon, it would attack his sea of consciousness. At that time, he would be doomed.

…

At this moment, in this galaxy.

Countless thick clouds rolled, and many spatial rifts appeared in numerous places.

One after another, alien races with powerful internal qi came through the spatial rifts.

They were covered in blood.

After they stepped onto the land of this galaxy, they let out excited howls and attacked the humans crazily.

At this moment, countless demonic beasts in purgatory seemed to have received some commands.

Under the leadership of the kings of the various races, they attacked the humans crazily.

In an instant, the entire purgatory turned bloody and seemed to be the end of the world.

…

Half a month later.

In Zongzhou of the Holy Region, the Si family, one of the nine great aristocratic families, had a meeting with many small and medium-sized aristocratic families and sects.

The Holy Lord of the Si family, Si Wujue, sat on the main seat and said to the crowd.

“From the looks of it now, the spatial rift has appeared again. This time, the spatial rift’s range is even bigger. The strength of many ghost and monster races has reached the True Saint and above.

“To fight against the races and ensure the safety of the Holy Region, a group of people will be heading to the Holy Region first.

“Each sect must send out 10 core members, 30 True Saint cultivation and above, and 100 below True Saint, and teleport them to purgatory in batches. This is a matter of great importance to the human race. All the sects and families cannot decline, or else they will be destroyed by the nine great aristocratic families.

“If anyone dares to do anything secretly at this time of crisis, don’t blame the nine great aristocratic families for being ruthless. Of course, the nine great aristocratic families will also send many core disciples to lead you to kill the three races. Do you have any objections?”

The Holy Lord of the Si family, Si Wujue, stared coldly at a sect.

“Will the nine great aristocratic families send their Holy Sons or their sect elders? Will you send the same number of related people to purgatory or based on the ratio?”

“That’s right. If we were to compare them in terms of quantity, it would be unfair to the small aristocratic families. Since the nine great aristocratic families occupy the most resources in the Holy Region, they must allocate proportionately. Only then would it be considered fair for the various great families.”

An elderly man from a small sect asked.

“After the crisis, you only need to listen to the instructions of the nine great aristocratic families. You don’t have to worry about the other details.”

Si Wujue said indiferently.

“Since this is a major matter of the human race, it is necessary for us to discuss it together. Can the nine great aristocratic families represent the opinions of all the aristocratic families? If there’s a selfish motive during the process of sending people, isn’t it killing someone with a borrowed knife? It’s better if Holy Lord Si finalizes the details before we discuss.”

The elderly man sneered and said.

“Boom!”

Before he could finish speaking, the elderly man’s body was suddenly crushed into a ball of meat paste.

His divine sense escaped frantically, letting out a shrill scream.

“Help!”

A wisp of qi energy shot out, directly shattering his soul.

“Does anyone else have any objections?”

Si Liuhe asked calmly.

Instantly, no one dared to say anything. A sect master was killed without any resistance. No one dared to say anything.

“Brother Liuhe is so overbearing. We naturally dare not make rash comments.”

Teng Zixu said with a smile.

“Brother Teng, you must be joking. With your strength, the Teng family will naturally lead the human race to deal with this crisis.”

Hearing this, Teng Zixu wanted to say something further, but he was interrupted by the family head of the Teng family.

Since Si Liuhe had acknowledged their status, there was no need for him to say anything else.

“Don’t be afraid, everyone. Although this journey may be dangerous, it will also bring great opportunities for enhancing our cultivation and strength when dealing with these alien races. Moreover, with the changes in the Path of Heaven, many Mystic Realms in the galaxy’s purgatory will slowly appear. They are supreme treasures left behind from the ancient war. Those destined to obtain them will surely advance greatly.”

Si Liuhe smiled faintly and said.

After the meeting, the aristocratic families slowly left.

Only the Teng family and the nine great aristocratic families were left.
