Chapter 45: Soul Nourishment Pill Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

After leaving the Du family, Qin Yu asked Lei Hu to prepare a large number of herbs.

After that, he prepared to refine the Soul Nourishment Pill.

To Qin Yu, the Soul Nourishment Pill barely had any cost, and the price could easily be lowered.

For three days, Qin Yu barely rested. He spent all his time refining the Soul Nourishment Pill.

During these three days, Yao Qing was in charge of guarding Qin Yu to prevent anyone from disturbing him.

Three days later, Qin Yu successfully refined more than three hundred Soul Nourishment Pills.

Looking at the pills placed in front of him, Qin Yu wiped the sweat from his forehead.

Currently, to Qin Yu, these three hundred plus Soul Nourishment Pills were extremely taxing and he looked much more haggard.

“I believe these three hundred Soul Nourishment Pills are enough to give the Shen family a blow,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

“Mr. Qin, what kind of pill is this?” Yao Qing couldn’t help but ask.

Qin Yu casually took one and threw it to Yao Qing. He smiled and said, “Try it.”

Yao Qing didn’t even look at it and directly stuffed it into his mouth.

A moment later, Yao Qing felt refreshed all over, and all his fatigue was swept away!

“This... What kind of pill is this?” Yao Qing’s face was full of shock, and his mouth was agape.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “This is called the Soul Nourishment Pill. In short, it is beneficial to the body.”

This made Yao Qing admire Qin Yu even more.

“Not only has Mr. Qin mastered the extraordinary breathing exercise, but you also have such outstanding alchemy skills...” Yao Qing said with a face full of admiration.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “If there is an opportunity in the future, I will teach you this breathing exercise method.”

“Thank you, Mr. Qin!” Hearing this, Yao Qing was overjoyed!

“Oh, right.” Yao Qing suddenly thought of something.

“Miss Yan came yesterday. I wonder what the matter is,” Yao Qing said.

At the mention of Yan Ruoxue, Qin Yu felt his tiredness disappear instantly, and a smile appeared on his face.

“Rumor has it that when you think of someone you like, you will subconsciously smile. So it’s true,” Yao Qing joked at the side.

“Screw you.” Qin Yu rolled his eyes at Yao Qing.

Then, he took out his phone and called Lei Hu.

About half an hour later, Lei Hu hurriedly drove to Dragon Paradise.

Qin Yu handed the Soul Nourishment Pill to Lei Hu and then said, “The price of these three hundred pills should be cheap, about three hundred yuan per pill.”

Lei Hu was stunned. He said somewhat awkwardly, “Three hundred Yuan for one pill? Isn’t... isn’t this too cheap? Previously, it was one million yuan for one pill...”

“Do what I ask you to do,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Then, he handed these three hundred pills to Lei Hu.

Lei Hu held the pill, and he got an idea.

He thought to himself, “As long as I do a good job of keeping it a secret, when the time comes, I will sell it at a higher price and he definitely won’t know.”

Thinking of this, Lei Hu held the pill and was about to leave.

“Wait.”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly called out to Lei Hu.

In the next second, Qin Yu took a step forward and reached out to grab Lei Hu’s neck, lifting him into the air!

Lei Hu struggled with all his might, but he found that he couldn’t break free at all!

Qin Yu’s palm was like an iron pincer and he was unable to move!

Soon, Lei Hu felt that it was difficult to breathe, and his face instantly flushed!

“You’d better not think of any shady ideas. You’ll only make money if I let you,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“I... I know...” Lei Hu said these few words with difficulty.

Qin Yu let go of Lei Hu, and Lei Hu sat down on the ground.

He wiped the sweat from his forehead and felt a chill on his back!

Lei Hu was certain that Qin Yu might have really killed him just now!

“I... I’m sorry, Mr. Qin...” Lei Hu wiped the sweat from his forehead and said with some lingering fear.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said indifferently, “Don’t worry, as long as you are obedient, I will never let you suffer a loss.”

Lei Hu hurriedly nodded and said, “Thank you, Mr. Qin. Thank you, Mr. Qin...”

“You can go now.” Qin Yu waved his hand.

Lei Hu didn’t stay any longer and quickly left the place.

Qin Yu knew very well that he had to use both kindness and power to make a sly fox like Lei Hu obedient. Otherwise, he could backstab him at any time.

“Next, I should prepare to go to the auction. I just don’t know if ten million is enough.” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Since ancient times, cultivation had always been extremely costly.

At this moment, Qin Yu deeply understood this sentence.

There was still half a month left before the auction, so Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry.

After Lei Hu left, Qin Yu fell asleep.

He slept for three whole days.

In these three days, the Soul Nourishment Pill had already circulated more than half of Jiangcheng!

Without any publicity, the Soul Nourishment Pill had practically spread through the entire city!

In an instant, Lei Hu became a popular person! He used this opportunity to quickly establish a health product company.

And the Shen family also quickly received this news.

“Mr. Shen, this is the Soul Nourishment Pill.” In Shen Yun’s office, Zhao Gang handed the Soul Nourishment Pill to Shen Yun with a fawning expression. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Shen Yun caressed the pill and couldn’t help but snort, “Is this pill really that miraculous?”

“It’s true!” Zhao Gang said hurriedly.

“I heard that many high-level figures in the city are fighting for this kind of pill.”

Shen Yun frowned. He stroked his chin and said in a low voice, “If I can obtain the formula for the Soul Nourishment Pill, the Shen family will definitely be able to rise to a higher level. By then, it won’t be a problem for us to expand out of Chuzhou!”

Thinking of this, Shen Yun looked at Zhao Gang and said, “Where did this Soul Nourishment Pill come from?”

Zhao Gang quickly said, “Rumor has it that it came from Lei Hu!”

“Lei Hu? You mean that lowlife?” Shen Yun couldn’t help but show a hint of contempt on his face.

“Yes, it’s him!” Zhao Gang hurriedly nodded and said.

Shen Yun couldn’t help but sneer as he said, “Does someone like him deserve the Soul Nourishment Pill?”
