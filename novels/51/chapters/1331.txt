Chapter 1332: Chapter 1,332, battle with Ling Yun 

“AH SAN, don’t mess around!”Wan ‘er hurriedly reprimanded.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “It doesn’t matter. I just want to try my right hand. If even ah San can’t defeat him, then I don’t need to battle Ling Yun.”

Wan ‘er seemed to feel that this sentence was quite reasonable and retreated to the side.

Ah San, on the other hand, felt humiliated.

He glared at Qin Yu and said, “Don’t look down on me. When I was in that mountain range, my spiritual power was only suppressed. It’s different now!”

After saying that, ah San began to use his spiritual power.

All the power was gathered on his fist.

“You don’t have spiritual power. I don’t believe how strong you are!”Ah San roared angrily and then clenched his fist and charged at Qin Yu!

Qin Yu didn’t neglect him. He clenched his right fist, and a pale golden light flickered.

Under the Rays of Light, Qin Yu raised his hand to meet AH SAN!

“Boom!”

This was a huge collision! The air was exploding!

Wan ‘er hurriedly made a move to protect the inn, in case the two of them fought and the inn was shattered.

After a loud sound, ah San staggered backward, and half of his fist was directly cracked!

The blood flowed down his fist, and it looked terrible.

“How are you? Are You Okay?”Qin Yu quickly walked over and asked.

Ah San didn’t care about his injuries. He stared at Qin Yu’s fist and said in surprise, “How... How is this possible? There is no spiritual power in your body?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “No.”

“This... is too ridiculous!”Ah San’s eyes were wide open. He obviously couldn’t believe it.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh in his heart.

He had only used 20% of his strength in that punch just now. If he had used his full strength, ah San would have died on the spot.

Of course, Qin Yu didn’t tell him. Otherwise, he would have definitely gone crazy.

“I really don’t know what kind of scene it will be after the spiritual power recovers,”Qin Yu sighed.

He looked at his fist, which was flashing with a faint radiance.

This was without the support of spiritual energy. It was just that he had recovered his physical body.

Tomorrow... I have to kill Ling Yun immediately, Qin Yu thought to himself coldly.

With Ling Yun’s abilities, he would definitely notice Qin Yu’s abnormality.

Once he escaped, Qin Yu wouldn’t be able to do anything to him.

“Ling Yun, don’t worry. I’ll kill you at the First Opportunity Tomorrow,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Ah San was still in shock. He wanted to ask something, but he was dragged out by Wan ‘Er.

“Young Master Qin, rest well.”Wan ‘er hurriedly left after saying this.

She was slightly worried.

From the fist exchange between Qin Yu and Ah San, even though Qin Yu was stronger than Ah San, he wasn’t much stronger.

With such strength, he wasn’t a match for Ling Yun.

“Sigh.”Wan ‘er sighed in her heart.

She could only pray in secret that Qin Yu would be able to defeat Ling Yun.

...

The next day.

Qin Yu got up early and prepared to look for Ling Yun.

Everyone already knew where Ling Yun was. The inn he stayed at was even more deserted.

It was because of his arrival that everyone was terrified. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Of course, there were also people who hid in the dark to watch the battle.

“Today is the appointed day,”Ling Yun said coldly as he stood in front of the window.

“If he still doesn’t come, don’t blame me for starting a massacre!”

A hint of viciousness flashed across Ling Yun’s eyes. His young face was filled with a viciousness that didn’t match his age.

On the other side, Qin Yu, Wan ‘er, and the others were also rushing over.

Along the way, Ah San was chattering non-stop while Wan ‘er was full of worries.

Seeing that they were getting closer and closer, Wan ‘er finally couldn’t help but speak.

“Young Master Qin, are you confident?”Wan ‘er asked.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I’m 90% confident.”

The reason why he wasn’t 100% confident was because of the unforeseen circumstances in the battle.

It was either kill him in one strike or stop the battle.

“No matter what, we can’t let him escape!”Qin Yu said coldly in his heart.

The group of three walked towards the inn.

Soon, their figures appeared below the inn.

The people who were secretly observing in the dark quickly discovered Qin Yu.

“That person should be Qin Yu, right?”

“That should be right. No one has dared to come near this place for the past few days. Who else could it be other than him?”

“This person looks ordinary. How would he dare to shout at that Ling Yun?”

“Who are the two people beside him? That girl seems to be that girl from the Zhao family. She could be considered to have had a great time back then.”

On the tall building, Ling Yun naturally noticed Qin Yu.

His eyes narrowed slightly as the corners of his mouth curled up into a cold smile.

“You’re here, you really dare to come!”Ling Yun’s face revealed a look of madness.

“Young master, be careful, that Zhao Wan ‘er is also here,”the attendant reminded him.

Ling Yun said coldly, “I don’t believe that she would dare to make a move against me!”

After saying that, Ling Yun shook violently and directly shattered the window. He jumped down and landed in front of Qin Yu.

Their eyes met, and the madness on Ling Yun’s face became even more intense.

“Qin Yu, you really dare to come!”Ling Yun’s eyes were wide open and filled with madness.

Qin Yu said expressionlessly, “I issued a letter of challenge to you. Why wouldn’t I Come?”

“Hahahahaha!”Hearing this, Ling Yun couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“You issued a letter of Challenge to me? Do you have the qualifications!”

“Let me tell you, I’m here to kill you today!”

Qin Yu remained silent. He clenched his right fist lightly, ready to attack at any time.

“Are the two of you planning to help him?”At this moment, Ling Yun’s gaze landed on Wan ‘er and Ah San.

Wan ‘er laughed. “Young Master Ling, you’re joking. We’re just accompanying him.”

After saying that, wan ‘er took ah San to the side.

Ling Yun looked at Qin Yu coldly. The spiritual energy in his entire body was surging rapidly.

In the dark, countless people were secretly watching this battle.

“Qin Yu, die!”

Ling Yun let out an angry roar. His internal Qi suddenly soared!

In his state of complete victory, he planned to show Qin Yu his might!

Qin Yu had been waiting for this opportunity. He narrowed his eyes and raised his right fist. All of his divine power gathered on his right fist and headed straight for Ling Yun’s face!

This punch was extremely fast. It was the gathering of all of Qin Yu’s fighting spirit. In the blink of an eye, he was right in front of Ling Yun!

Just the powerful Qi energy alone was enough to shatter Ling Yun’s handsome face!

Ling Yun’s expression changed drastically. An intense fear flashed across his heart!
