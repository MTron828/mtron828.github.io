Chapter 84: You Guys Deserve to Die! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

An extremely remote hill.

This place was sparsely populated and was surrounded by dense forests.

Here in this godforsaken place, there wasn’t even a cell phone signal.

In a certain cave, two burly men with tattoos were guarding a beautiful woman.

“Boss, this girl is really pretty,” one of the big men said with a lecherous look.

The other burly man also swallowed hard. They had never seen such a beautiful woman in their entire lives.

“Boss, why don’t we have some fun first?” One of the burly men asked.

The other man frowned and waved his hand. “Forget it. The client said that we must not hurt her.”

The person tied to the chair was Yan Ruoxue.

At this moment, there was no trace of panic on her face. She was extremely calm, which made the burly men a little unhappy.

“Do you know the consequences of kidnapping me?” Yan Ruoxue looked at the two men and said indifferently.

“Hehe, what consequences can there be? I will leave after I get the money!” One of them said with a smile.

A nonchalant smile appeared on Yan Ruoxue’s face.

“Boss, are we going to stay here for two days?” One of them frowned and said.

“We can earn 20 million in two days. Where else can we earn so much money? Don’t be insatiable.” The other person waved his hand and said.

Time passed minute by minute. Qin Yu was rushing here frantically.

The cars on the road kept backing up, but Qin Yu’s panic didn’t subside in the slightest.

If anything happened to Yan Ruoxue, Qin Yu would be miserable for the rest of his life.

Finally, half an hour later, the car stopped at the foot of the mountain.

Qin Yu, his fists unconsciously clenched, raised his head to look at the small mountain.

A murderous aura emanated from him. Anyone who saw it would tremble.

In the cave, the two burly men kept sizing up Yan Ruoxue.

Looking at Yan Ruoxue’s smooth skin, the two men kept swallowing hard.

“There’s such a beautiful woman right in front of us, but we can’t touch her. What a pity!” One of them said.

The eyes of the other brawny man kept darting around. No one knew what he was thinking.

“F * ck, it doesn’t matter! We’re going to run away sooner or later anyway. If we sleep with her and go abroad directly, who can find us?” They finally couldn’t hold it in anymore!

On the second day, they stood up and walked towards Yan Ruoxue.

Yan Ruoxue’s expression became a bit cold.

Facing such desperados, Yan Ruoxue couldn’t do anything either.

“You’d better think about it carefully,” Yan Ruoxue warned coldly.

“We’ve thought about it for a long time now,” the two brawny men said with a smile.

“To be able to play with a beautiful woman like you for two days, even if we can’t get the money, we’ll still be satisfied!”

They stretched out their hands and approached Yan Ruoxue step by step. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

When they saw that they were getting closer and closer to her, the breathing of the two of them became rapid.

Just as they were about to touch Yan Ruoxue, a stone suddenly flew in like a bullet!

This stone happened to hit one of the men’s hands!

In an instant, the palm was pierced through and white bones were exposed. A bloody smell immediately emanated!

“You... are courting death!” Qin Yu gave off a murderous aura that could even be felt by Yan Ruoxue, who was a distance away!

Yan Ruoxue looked at Qin Yu in shock. She knew that someone would definitely come to save her, but she didn’t expect that the first person to be found would be Qin Yu!

“Miss Yan, are you alright?” Qin Yu looked at Yan Ruoxue and asked anxiously.

Yan Ruoxue smiled and said, “If you had come a little later, something might have really happened.”

“D*mn, where did this b*stard come from? How dare he ruin our fun!” The brawny man covered his hands and said in pain.

“You want to save the damsel in distress? Then I will screw this woman in front of you!” Another brawny man sneered.

When he heard this, Qin Yu’s anger instantly reached its peak!

In Qin Yu’s heart, Yan Ruoxue was a noble and inviolable woman! Even Qin Yu himself didn’t dare to have any lewd thoughts!

Yet these two men actually dared to have such improper desires towards Yan Ruoxue!

“You... are courting death!” Qin Yu clenched his fists tightly. The murderous aura on his body became increasingly stronger, and a sense of oppression emanated!

The expressions of the two brawny men changed. For some reason, they actually felt a sense of fear!

“D*mn it, hurry up and kill this kid!” One of them shouted loudly.

As soon as he finished speaking, the two men charged towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s patience had long since disappeared. He took a step forward and raised his foot to smash his kneecap into pieces!

“Ouch! !” A painful wail resounded throughout the valley!

Qin Yu didn’t stop there. He reached out and grabbed the necks of the two burly men to lift them into the air!

“Tell me, who told you to do this?” Qin Yu suppressed his killing intent and said coldly.

The two burly men struggled desperately in the air, but they found that they couldn’t break free!

The fear in their hearts reached its peak in an instant!

“Don’t... Don’t kill us...” they spat out these words with great difficulty.

“Say it quickly!” Qin Yu roared angrily, scaring the two men so much that they instantly wet their pants!

“It’s... It’s Zhao Gang. Someone called Zhao Gang asked us to do this!” The two brawny men didn’t dare to hide anything and immediately spilled the beans on Zhao Gang.

When he heard this name, Qin Yu’s expression became even colder.

“Zhao Gang... I didn’t kill you, but you actually dared to plot against me... and even made a move against Miss Yan...” Qin Yu’s body trembled due to his anger.

“D*mn it... d*mn it... I shouldn’t have been soft-hearted. I should have killed him earlier...” Qin Yu guiltily muttered in a low voice.

If he had killed Zhao Gang earlier, Miss Yan wouldn’t have suffered this kind of misery!

“Sir... We have already told you, so can you spare us...” the two burly men said in anguish.

Qin Yu looked at the two of them coldly and said, “Anyone who dares to touch Yan Ruoxue will die!”

After saying that, Qin Yu exerted force with his hand and directly broke the necks of the two men!

Two burly men instantly fell to the ground and blood stained the ground.
