Chapter 391: Killing Inner Strength Grandmasters Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

In front of Qin Yu’s powerful strength, the golden tower was reduced to ruins.

All the energy dissipated like a wisp of wind.

Qiao Wu’s expression was extremely ugly! His eyes were filled with shock!

“This... how is this possible!?” Qiao Wu gritted his teeth and said.

According to the settings of this technique, as long as Qin Yu’s realm was below theirs, it was absolutely impossible for him to forcefully break through!

This was also one of their trump cards!

But now, this golden tower had been shattered by Qin Yu with a few punches!

“If this is your trump card, then I’m afraid you won’t be able to escape today.” Qin Yu grinned, revealing a mouthful of white teeth.

“How arrogant! How dare a mere Inner Strength Past Master say such arrogant words?!” A peak Inner Strength Grandmaster berated angrily.

Qin Yu glanced at him coldly, and in the next second, he suddenly appeared in front of him!

“Heavy Falling Space!”

Under this technique, this Inner Strength Grandmaster had nowhere to hide! He could only fight Qin Yu at a close distance!

However, Qin Yu’s physical body was extremely tough. Not to mention a mere peak Inner Strength Grandmaster, but even the physical body of a Martial Marquis might not be able to compare to Qin Yu’s!

“Bang!”

Under Qin Yu’s fierce fist, this Inner Strength Grandmaster couldn’t hold on any longer.

His chest was penetrated by a punch, and his internal organs were almost ruptured!

Before he could react, Qin Yu had already raised his hand and slapped his head.

“Heaven Swallowing Technique!”

As the technique was activated, the Meridian Circulation Technique in Qin Yu’s body also began to circulate!

All the inner strength was forcefully swallowed by Qin Yu, and an awe-inspiring Inner Strength Grandmaster died just like that!

Looking at his almost dried up body, Qiao Wu and the others immediately turned pale with fright!

“Oh no! Retreat!” Qiao Wu shouted!

The two of them didn’t even think about it and started to run away.

After the battle, they were exhausted.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s vigor was boundless, while Qiao Wu and the others were already scared out of their wits.

Under such circumstances, they already lost all fighting spirit, and their strength was greatly reduced!

“Do you think you can escape?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and stepped on the ground to use the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique before instantly catching up to them!

“Qiao Wu, I’ll hold him off. Hurry up and get reinforcements!” Qiao Wu’s companion shouted.

Unfortunately, Qiao Wu didn’t even turn his head back. He was completely scared out of his wits.

This Inner Strength Grandmaster gritted his teeth. His feet suddenly shook, and the space in front of Qin Yu suddenly began to distort!

Following that, Qin Yu’s body seemed to be transported to another space!

“Huh?” Qin Yu’s brows twitched, and he couldn’t help but sneer.

He had seen this spell before. It was the spatial spell that Cao Shan had used before!

“Do you think that the spell can still restrict me?” Qin Yu sneered.

“This spell can subdue hardness with softness. No matter how hard and fierce your fist is, it will be dissolved by this softness. Qin Yu, you...”

“Boom!”

Before he could finish his words, Qin Yu’s golden fist smashed into one side!

Under this enormous force, this space actually began to shatter!

“Who told you that you can only use softness to counter hardness? As long as the strength is large enough, any softness isn’t worth mentioning.” Qin Yu sneered.

“How... how is this possible!?” The Inner Strength Grandmaster’s eyes widened.

Qin Yu didn’t have time to waste with him. He immediately stepped forward and raised his hand to use the Heaven Swallowing Technique!

After killing him, Qin Yu once again used the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique and sprinted in the direction where Qiao Wu escaped.

As a peak Inner Strength Grandmaster, Qiao Wu’s speed was naturally very fast.

Although less than five minutes had passed, Qiao Wu had already fled several kilometers away.

Running at such a high speed consumed a lot of his inner strength.

Since Qiao Wu was already severely injured, he was already exhausted. He collapsed in a forest.

“He shouldn’t have caught up,” Qiao Wu thought to himself.

He wiped the sweat off his forehead and couldn’t help but grit his teeth. “There’s something strange about Qin Yu. I can’t use common sense to analyze it. I have to tell President Yan as soon as possible...”

“You’re a good lapdog. You are still thinking about the Yan family even at this time.” At this moment, Qin Yu’s voice suddenly rang in his ears.

Qiao Wu’s expression changed drastically!

He quickly turned around and looked at Qin Yu with a hint of fear in his eyes.

“Qiao Wu, you can’t escape,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Just as Qin Yu had said, Qiao Wu was completely exhausted at this moment. The possibility of him escaping was almost zero.

Qiao Wu’s expression was cold as he gritted his teeth and said, “Qin Yu, so what if you kill me? In front of the Yan family, you’re just a joke!”

“As long as the Yan family is willing, they can even invite a Martial Marquis or even a martial saint to kill you!” Qiao Wu gritted his teeth and said.

“Martial Marquis? Martial Saint? What is that?” Qin Yu was a little surprised.

Qiao Wu snorted coldly and said, “You don’t need to know! Qin Yu, it’s not too late for you to regret now. I might be able to plead for you to join the Yan family and become one of us!”

“At that time, you don’t need to struggle for your life like you do now. On the contrary, no matter where you go, you will be respected!” Qiao Wu’s tone was a little excited.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Yes, you will be respected wherever you go. But in front of your master, you have to grovel, right?”

Qiao Wu was stunned. He gritted his teeth and said, “If you want to survive in this world, you have to lower your head. Only kids get to do whatever they want.”

Qin Yu licked his lips and said, “I just can’t be a servile and obsequious person. That’s why I resisted.”

“If everyone is like you, then those who stand at the top of the pyramid will always be the same group of people.”

“And people like me who come from the bottom will never be able to rise.”

When he heard Qin Yu’s words, Qiao Wu’s eyes flashed and he seemed a little moved.

Qin Yu said coldly, “Qiao Wu, as long as you leave the Yan family, I can spare your life. You can leave.”

Qiao Wu’s expression changed slightly. He stared at Qin Yu and said, “You really want me to leave?”

“That’s right.” Qin Yu turned around and was about to leave.

But at this moment, madness flashed in Qiao Wu’s eyes!

He held a special knife and stabbed at Qin Yu’s back!

“Bang!”

However, just as his knife was about to touch Qin Yu, Qin Yu slapped his head.

With this slap, Qiao Wu’s skull was shattered. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

His huge body fell straight down.

Looking at Qiao Wu’s corpse, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a trace of pity inside.

To Qiao Wu, his so-called glory was only recognition from the Yan family. He was no longer a real individual.

This kind of concept had been deeply rooted in him for a long time. How could Qin Yu change his mind with just a few words?

To him, killing Qin Yu in exchange for a greater future was his lifelong wish.

How could everything in the world be black and white? It was nothing more than a clash caused by different worldviews.
