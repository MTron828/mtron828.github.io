2099 Qin Yu Versus Yao Xi

Taking a deep breath, Yao Xi looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Your sharp tongue won’t do you any good. You think you’re a sudden emergence of a new force, but you’re actually seeking your own death.”

Qin Yu sneered. “Yao Xi, to be frank, I’ve never taken a fancy to you. On my path of cultivation, I’ve encountered numerous people who are similar to you. However, they all lost to me in the end without exception.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Hmph, you don’t think you can turn the world upside down just because you obtained the Traceless Immortal Scripture. Today, I’ll let you see for yourself what heaven’s favorite is!” Yao Xi snorted coldly, and the internal qi in his body suddenly became even stronger.

Qin Yu was not afraid at all. Instead, he revealed a provocative smile.”Then let me see how powerful heaven’s favorite like you is.”

The atmosphere instantly became tense. Feeling the pressure in the air, the spectators at the foot of Mount Pheonix held their breaths and watched attentively.

Yao Xi’s eyes flashed with a hint of ruthlessness. He suddenly waved his palm, and a formidable aura instantly attacked Qin Yu. The speed was so fast that it was almost impossible for people to react.

However, at this critical moment, Qin Yu smiled slightly, and his figure instantly disappeared from where he was, dodging Yao Xi’s attack.

After a while, Qin Yu appeared on the mountain peak not far away.

He looked at Yao Xi with disdain in his eyes.

Yao Xi was not afraid. It was just a simple test, nothing to be afraid of.

“Yao Xi, let me see your true ability,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Alright, in that case, don’t blame me for being rude!” Yao Xi laughed heartily and said.

After saying that, the aura on Yao Xi’s body began to soar. Rays of light continuously lingered around his body. Following that, the tremendously dull armor on his body emitted a radiance at this moment as if it had been activated!

“The Yao family’s holy robe.” Holy Son Jiang recognized the clothes on Yao Xi’s body.

Saintess Gu nodded slightly and said, “Yao Xi seems to value this battle very much. He even put on his holy robe.”

“Of course. This is the first time Yao Xi has made a move in recent years. If he loses to Qin Yu, he will suffer a significant loss of reputation. It will even destroy his dao mind,” Holy Son Jiang said.

The Yao family’s holy robe was activated, and Yao Xi’s internal qi soared to the extreme!

One could sense traces of Holy Power in his internal qi. Compared to ordinary Semi-Saints, Yao Xi’s strength was obviously more terrifying!

“As expected of heaven’s favorite of his generation. This internal qi is terrifying,” someone in the crowd whispered.

Under this internal qi, Mount Phoenix began to tremble. Countless rocks dislodged and shot up from the ground and directly shattered into powder!

Qin Yu, not far away, frowned slightly. He could clearly feel the intense internal qi surging from Yao Xi’s body.

“As expected of the Yao family’s Holy Son,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Compared to the few Semi-Saints he encountered before, Yao Xi was much stronger.

“Is this the Holy Son with the Immortal Emperor bloodline flowing in his body?” Qin Yu murmured.

At this moment, Yao Xi’s hand held onto the radiance and arrived in an instant!

That punch shattered the void and passed through everything. In an instant, it arrived in front of Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s pupils constricted. He naturally did not dare to be negligent. Golden Light suddenly appeared on his fist, and then he abruptly met it head-on.

“Boom!”

A loud bang rang out at this moment, and the surrounding void shattered. Terrifying airwaves continuously swept in all directions, cutting the nearby mountains and trees into halves!

Some onlookers failed to dodge in time and were directly shaken into a bloody mist!

The place where the collision took place was covered by smoke, and it only slowly dissipated after a while.

Qin Yu frowned slightly, and there was even more shock in his heart.

Although it was just a simple punch, Yao Xi’s combat strength still shocked Qin Yu!

Qin Yu had a chaotic body. He was not afraid of anyone if he fought with his physical body!

However, Qin Yu did not gain any advantage from the collision of the punch just now!

“I’ve underestimated the bloodline of the Immortal Emperor,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Yao Xi, not far away, felt the same. He narrowed his eyes and muttered, “As expected of the chaotic body. Even with the holy robe, the game was still a draw.”

Even so, Yao Xi still sounded sarcastic.

Looking at Qin Yu, he sneered and said, “Do you know why I want to fight with you?” Because you are a chaotic body! Si Shiyue is also a chaotic body!”

At this point, Yao Xi grinned and said, “I want to use you to test the strength of a chaotic body. Then, I can gauge the gap between Si Shiyue and me.”

Qin Yu was slightly shocked, and there was more of a hint of surprise in his eyes.

Yao Xi’s words seemed to admit that he was inferior to Si Shiyue!

This was rare in the cultivation world. Every Holy Son was a proud person, and it was impossible for them to admit they were inferior to anyone!

However, Yao Xi had admitted the gap between the two of them. It was unknown whether Si Shiyue was too strong or Yao Xi was not confident enough.

“Teng Zixu is here too!” someone in the crowd suddenly exclaimed at this moment.

Turning around, Teng Zixu was walking over from not far away. As usual, he emitted an aura that was like that of a monarch, making people unable to resist bowing and paying homage.

“Mr. Teng,” someone hurriedly stepped forward and greeted him.

Teng Zixu nodded slightly. He then stood at a spot in the void and looked at the two of them quietly.

“I didn’t expect Teng Zixu to come to watch this battle.”

“Teng Zixu has already stepped into the True Saint cultivation realm. A battle at this level shouldn’t be significant to him.”

Teng Zixu’s arrival undoubtedly pushed the battle to a climax once again. Many people unconsciously approached Teng Zixu’s direction.

Yao Xi glanced at Teng Zixu, not far away, and said coldly, “Qin Yu, today, I will crush your ‘legend of invincibility’ of the chaotic body in front of everyone!

Before he finished his sentence, Yao Xi did not waste any more time. He raised his hand, and tens of thousands of dao techniques gathered instantly!

Streaks of light like thin threads in the air wrapped around Yao Xi’s body, fusing with his holy robe. At this moment, Yao Xi seemed to be under the influence of all kinds of techniques, and it was incredibly terrifying!

Qin Yu did not say anything else. The internal qi on his body continued to soar. Streaks of golden light emitted from his skin and flesh, burning hot and glaring!

At this moment, Yao Xi’s hands formed a seal, and he began to chant. In an instant, circles of starlight began to appear around him as if the entire starry sky was in his palm.

For a moment, Yao Xi descended like Devil Lord, incomparably majestic.
