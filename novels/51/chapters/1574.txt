Chapter 1575: Chapter 1,575, the treacherous elder Bai!!

As soon as he said this, Qin Yu’s expression immediately turned extremely cold.

Elder Bai knew that he was no match for Qin Yu, so he hurriedly hid behind him.

Qin Yu stretched out his palm, and a powerful suction force directly pulled him over!

He grabbed elder Bai’s neck with one hand and grabbed him in mid-air.

“I almost forgot that you, a troublemaker, let you live for so long,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Elder Bai opened his mouth with difficulty and said, “You... Do you have a guilty conscience and want to kill me to silence me...”

The people at the side also quickly tried to persuade him, “Mr. Qin, you... Please spare him. The Heavenly Cloud sect is in need of people right now...”

Qin Yu glanced at the crowd and then released his hand.

“I’ll let you live for a few more days,”Qin Yu said coldly.

After saying that, Qin Yu raised his hand and gently tapped on elder Bai’s forehead.

A mark instantly entered his mind.

“No matter where you run to, I’ll find you,”Qin Yu said coldly.

This instantly made elder Bai’s face turn extremely pale, but he didn’t know what to do.

......

Qin Yu no longer paid attention to elder Bai. He walked in front of the deputy sect master and asked, “Deputy sect master, do you have any news about Jue Wu?”

The deputy sect master panted heavily and said with difficulty, “I haven’t heard. What... What’s Wrong?”

Qin Yu frowned tightly and told the deputy sect master what had happened.

After the deputy sect master heard it, his face didn’t look too good.

He said in a low voice, “Jue Wu is powerful, so nothing should happen...”

“Normally, that’s true, but...”Qin Yu opened his mouth and swallowed the rest of his words.

The fewer people who knew about Jue Wu’s nirvana body, the better.

With Jue Wu’s strength, nothing should happen to her. Even if she couldn’t beat the two godly kings, she would definitely be able to protect herself.

However, because of absolute dance’s constitution, people had to worry.

“Mr. Qin, the Vice Sect Master’s health is not good. You should let him rest well...”someone walked up and said.

Qin Yu grunted. He looked at the vice sect master and said, “Vice sect master, please help and mobilize the heavenly cloud sect’s connections to look for absolute dance.”

“Okay... Okay.”The deputy sect master nodded and agreed.

Qin Yu didn’t disturb the deputy sect master anymore and immediately looked at Di Zun.

“Find me a room,”Qin Yu said.

Di Zun quickly nodded and said, “Master, follow me.”

Qin Yu followed Di Zun all the way to the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s pharmacy.

“All the herbs of the heavenly cloud sect are here,”Di Zun introduced.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “The deputy sect master is not a big problem. Don’t worry too much.”

“Okay, master. Thank you very much,”Di zun bowed and said.

“By the way, sect master of the Tianyun sect, what exactly is going on?”Qin Yu stopped Di Zun and could not help but look at the cultivation mountain.

At this moment, the Cultivation Mountain had also been reduced to ruins. It looked terrible.

Di Zun Sighed and told Qin Yu what had happened.

“We all thought the sect master was dead. We didn’t expect that it was just an avatar of the Yu Huashen’s divine stone.”Di Zun couldn’t help but sigh.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “In other words, the sect master of the Tianyun sect has never been on the Cultivation Mountain? What we saw was only one of his avatars?”

“It’s very possible.”Di Zun nodded.

“As for where his original body went, we have been guessing.”

“Some people said that he went to travel around the world to cultivate, and some people said that he was tired of this kind of life and had long changed his identity to live in seclusion. But these are all guesses.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He only felt that the sect master of the Tianyun sect was becoming more and more mysterious and unfathomable.

If he was willing to help, the chances of winning this battle would be much higher.

“Okay, I got it.”Qin Yu nodded to Di Zun.

“Then I won’t bother you anymore.”Di Zun didn’t stay any longer and turned around to leave.

In the pharmacy, Qin Yu found a few herbs and started to refine a pill.

Although the demand for this pill wasn’t big, it still required a certain amount of time and effort. It would probably take a day and a night.

That night.

In the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s meeting hall, many elders were sitting around a table.

“Elder Bai, why did you call us here?”An elder asked.

Elder Bai cleared his throat and said in a deep voice, “I specially invited everyone to have a chat because of Qin Yu’s matter.”

“What do you mean? Elder Bai, if you have something to say, please say it directly.”An elder said.

“Have you ever thought that Qin Yu would use this opportunity to kill our vice sect master?”Elder Bai said indifferently.

“I know that he has some alchemy skills, but why would he be so kind to help us?”

“You must know that there is a deep hatred between the heavenly cloud sect and him!”

Everyone looked at each other when they heard that.

“Impossible. If Qin Yu wants to harm the deputy sect master, he could have made a move last time, or he could have killed the heavenly cloud sect together with Yongji!”An elder said coldly.

“That’s right. If it wasn’t for Qin Yu’s help last time, the Heavenly Cloud sect wouldn’t be where it is today.”

Elder bai sneered and said, “Pure. You guys are really pure! Don’t forget that our sect master is still on the Cultivation Mountain. Who knows if he is afraid?”

“Hehe, with Qin Yu’s current ability, if he wants to kill the deputy sect master, why does he need to use such methods? If he wants to kill someone, who here can stop him?”Another elder retorted.

“Elder Bai, don’t stir up trouble here.”

“That’s right. Qin Yu helped us out of kindness, but we are so suspicious. Don’t you think it’s too much?”

Elder BAI’s expression turned cold as he snorted. “Have you all forgotten the grudge between Qin Yu and My Tianyun Sect?”

“Ling Yun died at his hands, and so did the first elder! Even the sect master’s son died at his hands!”

“How can such hatred disappear just like that?”

Even though that was the case, the elders present didn’t buy it.

In their opinion, the current Qin Yu would definitely not plot against the Heavenly Cloud sect.

Seeing this, elder Bai took a deep breath and said, “How about this, the alchemist I found Will Arrive Tomorrow. Let him try first, how about it?”

“If My Alchemist can cure the vice sect leader, then everyone will be happy. If he really can’t do it, let Qin Yu try again. Is that Alright?”

Everyone thought for a moment, then nodded and said, “Alright, then we’ll do as you say. But... Remember, don’t offend Qin Yu, and don’t Be Rude!”

“Don’t worry.”Elder Bai laughed coldly.

The reason why elder Bai did this was to make a contribution. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The current Heavenly Cloud sect could be said to be a group of dragons without a leader. If the vice sect master withdrew, it was very likely that the next one would be chosen from among them.

If they could make a contribution at this time, it was very likely that they would become the next acting sect leader!
