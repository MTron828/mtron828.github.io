When he saw this call, Yan Sihai couldn’t help but frown.

Then, he picked up the phone and smiled. “Teng Gong, why did you suddenly call me?”

On the other end, Teng Gong said somewhat angrily, “Yan Sihai, you actually killed my people!”

Yan Sihai was stunned and frowned. “What are you talking about? When did I kill your people?”

Teng Gong said angrily, “The reporters I sent to the Saint Confucian Sect were all slapped to death by Gu Canghai!”

“Yan Sihai, how did you educate your men? He killed them just like that? What do you take the Teng family for?!”

“Gu Canghai...” Yan Sihai couldn’t help but clench his teeth. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

As they were both capitalists, they still had to give each other some respect.

“Don’t worry, I will give you a satisfactory answer to this matter,” Yan Sihai said in a deep voice.

Teng Gong snorted and said, “It’s best if that’s the case. Yan Sihai, your father and I are old friends. I hope that this matter won’t ruin the relationship between the two families.”

After saying these words, Teng Gong hung up the phone.

Yan Sihai looked at the phone for a moment, then snorted coldly and said, “F * ck you, it’s just a few ants who were killed. Who do you think you are?!”

Even though he said so, Yan Sihai still picked up the phone and scolded Gu Canghai.

“Dad.”

At this moment, a young man walked in from outside the door.

When he saw this young man, a smile immediately appeared on Yan Sihai’s face.

“Jinyao, why did you suddenly come?” Yan Sihai said with a smile.

Yan Jinyao said, “I came to tell you a piece of news.”

“Oh really? What news?” Yan Sihai said with a smile.

It could be seen that Yan Sihai loved his son very much.

Yan Jinyao gently clenched his hand and slowly said, “I’ve stepped into the Martial Marquis Realm.”

Yan Sihai was instantly stunned.

Stepped into the Martial Marquis Realm? His son had actually stepped into the Martial Marquis Realm?

After all, Yan Jinyao was only about thirty years old!

Such talent was probably unheard of in the world!

“Hahahaha! As expected of my son!” Yan Sihai couldn’t help but burst out laughing!

“You are probably the first young man in Jingdu to step into the Martial Marquis Realm!”

Yan Jinyao didn’t deny this.

All along, Yan Jinyao had been called a genius, and he was also known as Jingdu’s number one genius.

However, unlike the arrogant Han Wei, Yan Jinyao was relatively more low-key.

“Hmph, Han Wei monopolizes the resources of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association and is only a half-step Martial Marquis,” Yan Sihai said with a cold snort.

“But my son is already a Martial Marquis!”

This made Yan Sihai extremely proud.

He immediately asked someone to spread the news.

...

Three days later, Qin Yu’s injuries had almost recovered.

He stood up from the ground and couldn’t help but grit his teeth.

“Gu Canghai... I will never let the Saint Confucian Sect off!” Qin Yu said coldly.

He didn’t waste any time and immediately began the next round of revenge!

This time, Qin Yu was even crazier. All the families with ties to the Saint Confucian Sect was affected!

None of the disciples of the Saint Confucian Sect were left alive. They were all killed by Qin Yu with one slap!

In just two days, at least a hundred disciples of the Saint Confucian Sect had died!

“Qin Yu...” Gu Canghai was trembling with anger, but there was nothing he could do!

Qin Yu had the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch ability. He couldn’t be captured or killed, so he could do whatever he wanted.

Yan Sihai had given him an order to settle the matter properly within three days.

Helpless, Gu Canghai was prepared for a second negotiation.

He found Qin Yu’s number and called him personally.

After the call was connected, Gu Canghai said coldly, “What exactly do you want?”

Qin Yu sneered. “Gu Canghai, my demands have been stated clearly enough, right?”

“Hand over He Teng and Elder Qu, and let the Pavilion Master return to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion!”

“Otherwise, I will kill every single member of the Saint Confucian Sect!”

Gu Canghai gnashed his teeth in anger, but he didn’t dare to flare up.

Because he knew that Qin Yu would really do it!

“Alright, I will agree to it.” Gu Canghai gnashed his teeth and said.

“But I’m telling you, you better not let me see you, or else... I’ll definitely pull out your tendons and skin you alive!”

Qin Yu sneered. “Don’t worry, even if you don’t kill me, I’ll kill you.”

After saying this, Qin Yu hung up the phone.

Gu Canghai felt gloomy and uncertain. His face, which was full of wrinkles, trembled from time to time.

He took out his phone and dialed Xia Hang’s number.

Fortunately, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association quickly agreed to Gu Canghai’s request.

After all, the higher-ups had given orders. Not only did they not dare to touch Ji Yuhong, but they even served her well every day. There was no point in locking her up here.

The next day, Qin Yu quietly returned to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion and waited for the return of the Pavilion Master.

However, he didn’t dare to relax. After all, no one knew if Gu Canghai would suddenly arrive.

That evening, a car stopped at the entrance of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

The moment the car opened, the Pavilion Master was seen stepping out of the car.

Qin Yu, who had a keen divine sense, quickly discovered the Pavilion Master.

He suddenly stood up and quickly arrived at the entrance.

As expected, the Pavilion Master was slowly walking over.

Qin Yu quickly went up to greet her. He felt both excited and somewhat guilty.

“Pavilion Master, are you alright?” Qin Yu asked in a low voice.

The Pavilion Master glanced at Qin Yu and said with a nonchalant smile, “Why wouldn’t I be?”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said in a low voice, “It’s all my fault. If it weren’t for me, you wouldn’t have suffered such hardships...”

The Pavilion Master glanced at Qin Yu and said indifferently, “It was my own decision. It had nothing to do with you. You don’t have to blame yourself.”

“Moreover, you’ve done well enough.”

Qin Yu raised his head and was somewhat moved.

“Pavilion Master!”

Soon, everyone from the Divine Alchemist Pavilion rushed out.

They clustered around the Pavilion Master, and everyone was overjoyed.

“Pavilion Master, it’s all thanks to Elder Qin. Otherwise, the Divine Alchemist Pavilion would definitely have fallen into the hands of the traitors!”

As they spoke, everyone looked at the First Elder, who was kneeling on the square.

The Pavilion Master frowned. She slowly stepped forward and walked towards the First Elder.

“Pavilion Master... . .” Upon seeing the Pavilion Master, the First Elder immediately panicked.

He said with some anguish, “Pavilion Master, on account of the many years that I have served the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, please spare me this time... . .”

The Pavilion Master’s long and narrow eyes contained some coldness.

“There is only one outcome for betraying the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. You know it better than me.” The Pavilion Master said indifferently.

The First Elder’s expression immediately became extremely ugly. He shouted with all his might, “Pavilion Master, please spare me...”

But the Pavilion Master completely ignored him and left with large strides.

Qin Yu glanced at the First Elder and raised his hand to slap him, turning him into meat paste.

After that, Qin Yu quickly followed behind the Pavilion Master.

“Pavilion Master, I urgently need a stalk of 5,000-year-old herbs right now. Do you have any ideas?” Qin Yu impatiently asked.
