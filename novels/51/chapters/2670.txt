Chapter 2671: The Miracle Reborn Lotus

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu gently caressed the two magical artifacts. The Nine Heavens Startling Rainbow Sword was refined from the thunder in the sky. It might trigger the thunder of the Nine Heavens in a battle. The power of this sword would increase greatly in the land of thunder.

Whereas Heavenly Wave Sword carried a great sword intent with it. It could completely release the will of the waterfall that filled the sky to destroy the soul power.

As Qin Yu was considering, he had completely understood the two magical artifacts.

This time, the two magical artifacts didn’t resist. Their artifact spirits were somewhat discouraged.

The Ten Direction Annihilation seemed to have absorbed too much of their power in the battle just now.

It was not just these two magical artifacts. Most of the other Dharma Treasures here were the same. Some of them were even close to having their artifact spirits dissipate.

The difference between these magical artifacts could be seen now. The Dragon’s Roar Spear was no longer as imposing as before. When Qin Yu’s divine sense scanned it over again, there was no trace of resistance at all.

In the corner, there was a slightly old box. It did not have any energy fluctuations.

Moreover, it was covered in dust. Qin Yu frowned.

He suddenly remembered something.

All the magical artifacts were connected to the Ten Directions Annihilation. The power of the artifact spirits was extracted uncontrollably.

However, only this box was not connected at that time. Qin Yu held the box in his hand and took out the magical artifact inside.

It was a glazed lotus. However, when Qin Yu probed his divine sense into it, he did not discover anything unusual.

He only saw a large area of murky mist, but there was nothing special about it.

“Hmm? Is it Miracle Reborn Lotus? But it doesn’t seem like it. How did this thing end up here?”

Immortal Emperor Yao’s voice sounded in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

“Immortal Emperor Yao, do you know the origin of this thing?”

Qin Yu asked in doubt.

This thing could isolate the power extraction of Ten Directions Annihilation, so it should be an extraordinary item. However, Qin Yu did not find anything unusual after careful inspection. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

He didn’t even sense a trace of energy fluctuation, nor did it look like a weapon or any other magical artifact. Could it be that it was used to smash people?

“Try to instill the power of Saint Kingdom into it.”

Immortal Emperor Yao was silent for a long time as if he was studying this Dharma Treasure.

“Okay!”

The Heart of Saint Kingdom lit up. A burst of energy pierced through the void and landed directly on Qin Yu’s body.

The mobilization of the power of Saint Kingdom could directly pass through the void and arrive instantly.

At this moment, a portion of the mighty and violent power of the Saint Kingdom was instilled into this lotus.

However, after a moment, the aura disappeared.

In the world of Reborn Lotus, a lotus flower slowly grew out, and the chaotic world slowly separated.

A golden aura was emitted from the lotus core.

The aura swam in this turbid world, but it did not melt. Instead, it was like the sun in the dark clouds that could not be covered.

“Hmm? It seems to be useful!”

Qin Yu was overjoyed. He once again sent the power of Saint Kingdom into it.

However, he did not dare to use the power of Saint Kingdom wantonly. The loss of the power of Saint Kingdom would bring great turmoil to the entire Saint Kingdom. Therefore, he only tried it slowly before he figured out this magical artifact.

As the Saint Power continued to pour in, a few more lotuses slowly bloomed.

Even more golden Qi was emitted from the lotus flowers into this turbid world. Qin Yu moved closer to the golden Qi and was about to start studying it.

“Retreat! Don’t touch it!”

However, he was forced back by Immortal Emperor Yao.

Qin Yu jumped in fright and hurriedly withdrew his divine sense from the lotus.

“What is this thing? Immortal Emperor Yao, hurry up and tell me.”

Qin Yu felt a little eager.

“It was indeed Miracle Reborn Lotus, the Dharma Treasure that I know. This thing was also a supreme treasure that many people grabbed in the Saint World back then! However, there aren’t many people who recognize this item. Only those with the Heart of the Saint Kingdom can recognize it.”

“Why?”

Qin Yu was somewhat puzzled.

“Activating this item requires a huge amount of energy. In the Saint World, only the most precious power of the Saint Kingdom has this kind of energy. Therefore, the natives can’t understand this Dharma Treasure. Moreover, this is an item of the gods. It just fell into the Saint World by accident. This item seems to have been severely damaged, but it can still produce some Miracle Qi.”

Immortal Emperor Yao clicked his tongue.

“Then how do I use this Dharma Treasure?”

Qin Yu asked in doubt.

“Since this thing is called ‘Miracle’, the gas released by these blooming lotuses is the Miracle Qi. If you inhale it, a huge change will occur. For example, your Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze can release the most terrifying attack of the most primitive eye power in a short time. Your sequence of prints and shots can directly pierce through hidden enemies without aiming. Your Dusk Saber might evolve again and become the strongest saber in the Saint Kingdom.” Hearing Immortal Emperor Yao’s words, Qin Yu took in a cold breath.

He felt his eyes light up. F*ck! Wouldn’t he be invincible with this thing?

“Don’t be too happy yet. That’s the effect that can only be achieved when all the lotus flowers bloom in Reborn Lotus meanwhile the world is filled with the Miracle Qi. Such a small trace of the Miracle Qi can probably increase one’s strength by 10%.”

Immortal Emperor Yao snickered.

Qin Yu nodded. Even so, he still found it a little unbelievable.

The amount of Saint Power he had infused was not much, so he could not increase his combat strength by a large amount.

“This is simply heaven-defying! Who forged this magical artifact?”

“This is a Dharma Treasure refined by the ancestor of Buddhism in pursuit of extreme power and breaking through to the Immortal Emperor realm. It was created to comprehend the final Great Dao. However, the backlash of this Miracle Qi was too serious, causing him to die directly. After that, all news of this Dharma Treasure was lost.”

Immortal Emperor Yao seemed to have come into contact with this Dharma Treasure before, so he was very familiar with it.

“It’s still good enough anyway. As long as it doesn’t need to produce Miracle Qi, it’s hundreds of times stronger than the Explosive Blood Pill when used at a critical moment. Your realm probably can’t withstand too much of the Miracle Qi either.”

Qin Yu frowned. The effect of this thing was heaven-defying, but he also had to bear the backlash.

The backlash suffered after forcefully prying into the Great Dao was also extremely harsh.

To be able to cause a Level 7 Divine Realm mighty figure who had condensed a divinity to die, such a backlash was probably not something he could withstand.

“Oh, the Seal of Heaven Returning?”

Qin Yu was suddenly overjoyed. His heart began to beat rapidly.

Even if he died, he could still be revived with the Seal of Heaven Returning.. In that case, wouldn’t he be able to use this Reborn Lotus indefinitely?
