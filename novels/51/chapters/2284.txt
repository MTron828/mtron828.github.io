2285 Jue Wu’s Closed-Door Cultivation

“Jue Wu, where have you been?”

“I’m in purgatory looking for demonic beasts for food. Some of the demon beasts here are really delicious. I’m hungry again by mentioning it.”

Qin Yu was speechless. “Didn’t you agree to cultivate? Why did it become eating demonic beasts?”

“I’ve already a fourth-grade True Saint! Buddy, quickly come back to Solitary Cloud City. Is that demonic egg with you? I’ve been having a strange feeling these days.”

Jue Wu’s smug voice sounded.

“Alright. It can’t be that the demonic egg going to hatch soon, right?”

Qin Yu asked somewhat curiously. Jue Wu had fed the demonic egg with blood essence previously. Therefore, Jue Wu could sense that there was a change in the demonic egg.

“I don’t know, but sometimes I dream of that demonic egg.”

Jue Wu was unsure.

“Alright, let’s gather in Solitary Cloud City first.”

Qin Yu was a little curious about what kind of existence the demonic egg would become after hatching.

Being able to intimidate the soul of the ancient Fierce Beast, the unicorn was not something that an ordinary demonic beast could do.

He hopped onto a warship and headed toward Solitary Cloud City.

After returning to Solitary Cloud City, Qin Yu sent the impatient Jue Wu into the Sumeru ring.

At this moment, the demonic egg in the Sumeru ring was floating in the air. It suddenly stopped before Jue Wu when it saw her enter.

She gently reached out her hand to touch the demonic egg.

It was unsure if Qin Yu was hallucinating. At the moment of contact, something seemed to have entered Jue Wu’s hand from the demonic egg.

“Qin Yu, I can feel an energy blending with the spiritual energy in my body, and then it’s being fed back into the demonic egg.”

Jue Wu said curiously.

“You don’t have a bad feeling, do you?”

“No, I feel that this energy seems to be refining my spiritual energy, and I feel like I’m about to break through.”

The demonic egg seemed to have sensed that Jue Wu was cultivating and suddenly entered her body.

From time to time, the ghostly qi would erupt from her body.

“F*ck, is the Nirvana Body so terrifying? Another breakthrough?”

Qin Yu was somewhat dumbfounded. Breaking through so casually made him somewhat jealous.

He had, thus far, comprehended the Way of Annihilation through the Traceless Immortal Scripture. However, it did not belong to the Dao he comprehended but was more of a power that Qin Yu had replicated after experiencing the evolution of Wu Ji’s robe tens of thousands of times.

As a result, he had been stuck at fourth-grade True Saint and had yet to break through.

“I’ve heard of the Nirvana Body. Under normal circumstances, the cultivation speed will slow down after reaching the True Saint. Her condition now is indeed rare.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Elder Guai was also somewhat puzzled.

“It might be from the demonic egg.”

At that time, the masked woman had particularly shown up for this demonic egg. Thus this demonic egg should not be simple.

At this moment, a faint power of the Path of Heaven flashed across Jue Wu’s body.

“Is she really going to break through to fourth grade?”

Old Huai exclaimed.

Not only was Jue Wu’s internal qi constantly growing stronger but also the internal qi of the demonic egg seemed to be slowly accumulating as if it would break out of the shell at any time.

“Jue Wu’s retreat this time should last for quite some time. Don’t disturb her before she comes out of seclusion.”

With a thought, Qin Yu enveloped Jue Wu with a few simple formations to prevent Xiaoru and Little Fatty from disturbing her when playing.

“Oh yes, I still have to prepare some demonic beast meat for Jue Wu. She might need to eat it at any time.”

Qin Yu thought to himself.

“Elder Guai, is Xiao Yu showing any signs of waking up?” Qin Yu suddenly thought of Xiao Yu.

“Her internal qi is very stable now, but her soul has been in a deep sleep and unable to wake up.” Elder Guai shook his head.

Qin Yu frowned. His divine sense entered Xiao Yu’s sea of consciousness.

At this moment, there was no fluctuation in Xiao Yu’s divine sense at all. It was like the previous situation when Qin Yu suppressed his black divine sense. She could only rely on herself if she wanted to wake up.

However, unless her self-consciousness erupted or he found the medicinal herbs that could stimulate her soul. Otherwise, there was no hope of helping her.

Coming out from the Sumeru ring, he heard Ji Yue, the owner of the Moon Listening Pavilion, knocking on the door.

“Qin Yu, someone is looking for you outside. It’s a beautiful little girl. Can she come to your room?”

“Hmm? Let her in.”

Qin Yu felt a little strange. He did not have any friends here. Who could it be?

“Hmph, you don’t behave.”

Ji Yue turned around and left angrily as if she was furious at Qin Yu’s attitude.

“This is ridiculous.” Qin Yu shook his head.

Not long after, a young girl entered the room. This girl still had many injuries on her body as if she had experienced a great battle.

“Who are you?”

“Mr. Qin, please save our young miss. You’re the only one who can save the Yun family now.”

The girl sobbed as she covered her mouth, afraid that she would cry out loud.

Qin Yu suddenly realized as he recalled the scene he encountered when he first stepped into this galaxy.

At that time, with the help of Uncle Qun and Yun Qingyun, he had a preliminary understanding of this continent.

“What happened to the Yun family?”

Qin Yu frowned.

“A group of cultivators invaded the Heavenly Origin Continent. Our Yun family was originally a top-notch prominent aristocratic family. However, these people have extremely high cultivation. Even though we gathered all our elites, we failed to resist them.”

“Where did these people come from? They should have their motives, right?”

“I heard from the family head that they’ve come for the Green Spirit Tree. They want the Yun family’s three Green Spirit Trees, and at the same time, the Yun family is occupying several eyes of the Spiritual Spring eyes, and they want the Yun family to move out. Otherwise, no one will survive.”

The young girl said bitterly.

“The leader is a monk, a powerful cultivator who has survived for many years in this galaxy. The other is a cultivator from the Mysterious Dark Sect, Nangong Qi. He was the one who brought this monk into our Heavenly Origin Continent!”

The girl gritted her teeth and said.

“Nangong Qi, he’s from the Mysterious Dark Sect again!”

This person was meticulous. He was the one who had captured Wang Feng and the others on the Fire Unicorn Continent and nearly killed them.

“Yes, it’s him! Previously, the Yun family and the Mysterious Dark Sect always had business dealings, so I gave them a Yun family’s coordinate rune. I didn’t expect them to betray the Yun family. Uncle Qun and many other family members have been killed by that monk. Young Miss has no choice but to ask me to beg Mr. Qin to save us.”

The girl’s eyes were red. She sobbed and continued.

“The family has said that if Mr. Qin can save our Yun family, the Yun family’s supreme treasures, the three Green Spirit Trees, can be gifted to Mr. Qin.”

“Let’s go now. We’ll talk about this later. It just so happens that I have a score to settle with Nangong Qi.”

Qin Yu said coldly,

Previously, the Mysterious Dark Sect had escaped because of the sudden appearance of the Mystic Realm in the seventh level of purgatory. This time, it was a good opportunity to settle all their scores.
