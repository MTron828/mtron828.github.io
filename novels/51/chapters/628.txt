As soon as he said that, everyone turned to look at him!

“Qin Yu?!” Xie Qu was stunned, then he couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

Soon, everyone in the office couldn’t help but sneer.

“Putting aside the fact that Qin Yu is dead, even if he isn’t dead, do you think he can do it with his ability?” Xie Qu sneered.

Yan Jinyao snorted and said, “Even I can’t do it, let alone Qin Yu.”

Everyone sneered at this guess. No one took it seriously.

Although Qin Yu was talented, he wasn’t that strong.

Moreover, in their eyes, Qin Yu had long become a dead man.

“Fortunately, we have a new inheritor,” said Qu Xie with a smile.

“A new inheritor?” Yan Jinyao frowned.

Qu Xie nodded and said, “Yes. To tell you the truth, the three brothers didn’t have more than 10% inheritance, but this time, the new inheritor’s compatibility is very high, as high as 40%!”

Yan Jinyao’s expression changed slightly.

40%? The three brothers from before had made Yan Jinyao feel pressured.

Wouldn’t this 40% inheritor be even stronger?

“You guys aren’t outsiders, so I’m not afraid to tell you,” Qu Xie continued.

“The higher-ups’ opinion is to select talents from all over the country and choose the one with the highest compatibility.”

“If the compatibility can reach 80%, then his strength will be unimaginable.”

This made Yan Jinyao feel a little uneasy. He looked at Qu Xie and said coldly, “President Qu, please arrange a blood bath for me immediately. The sooner the better.”

Qu Xie seemed to have guessed it, so he wasn’t surprised.

“Don’t worry. We have already prepared it for you. Come here and wait tomorrow morning,” said Qu Xie.

Yan Jinyao nodded. He didn’t say anything and turned around to leave.

...

In a house in the suburbs of Jingdu.

Qin Yu took off his black robe and changed into a clean set of clothes.

“I don’t think anyone can guess my identity,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He deliberately chose the bronze sword instead of using his fist.

This way, no one would suspect him.

“This bronze sword... is stronger than I imagined,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Just one slash had cut down Guan Shan. Even Qin Yu himself didn’t expect it.

But Qin Yu knew very well that his identity would be exposed sooner or later.

Therefore, Qin Yu wanted to take advantage of this period of time to cultivate as soon as possible and at the same time thoroughly understand the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

In the evening, the news that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association was preparing to recruit people from all over the country spread.

At the same time, they also announced in a high-profile manner that an even stronger person had appeared in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. His strength was above that of the three Guan family brothers!

After he saw this news, Qin Yu’s expression became extremely cold!

Recruiting people from all over the country? How much blood would they take?!

One had to know that this blood all came from Yan Ruoxue!

The more blood they absorbed, the more suffering Yan Ruoxue would have to endure!

Qin Yu clenched his teeth!

After a long time, Qin Yu finally loosened his tightly clenched fist.

That night, Qin Yu came to Xia Hang’s home again.

When he saw Qin Yu sitting on the sofa, Xia Hang’s expression was extremely ugly.

He said with a cold expression, “Qin Yu, why are you here again?!”

Qin Yu picked up a cigarette from the table and lit it, then slowly said, “I will come often in the future.”

This made the veins on Xia Hang’s forehead bulge. He berated, “Qin Yu! You killed the three Guan family brothers. You have already attracted attention! You are implicating me! Do you understand?!”

Qin Yu sneered. “Xia Hang, do you have any other choice now? If the Jingdu Martial Arts Association finds out that you told me your location, do you think they will spare you?”

Xia Hang opened his mouth, and his expression didn’t look pleasant.

“When I overthrow the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, I will give you credit.” Qin Yu blew out a smoke ring.

Xia Hang couldn’t help but sneer. “It’s already tough for you to save Yan Ruoxue, but you want to overthrow the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Qin Yu glanced at Xia Hang coldly and said, “Not only do I want to overthrow the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, but I also want to kill all the higher-ups behind it.”

Xia Hang seemed unwilling to argue with Qin Yu. He said coldly, “Why are you looking for me? Just say it.”

“The Jingdu Martial Arts Association has nurtured a few blood heirs, right?” Qin Yu played with the lighter and said coldly.

Xia Hang said coldly, “Qin Yu, stop, or else...”

“Cut the crap!” Qin Yu interrupted Xia Hang.

Xia Hang gritted his teeth and said coldly, “I can tell you, but this is the last time.”

“You have no choice.” Qin Yu had no intention of negotiating.

Xia Hang had no choice. He could only write down an address on the paper.

Qin Yu took the address and glanced at it. He sneered. “Looks like there are quite a number of people.”

Xia Hang snorted, “You can leave.”

“No, I have one more thing.” Qin Yu shook his head.

“What else do you want to do?!” Xia Hang said with some anger.

Qin Yu said coldly, “I want to enter the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. Think of a way to bring me in.”

“Don’t even think about it!” Hearing this, Xia Hang was instantly furious!

“Qin Yu, are you crazy!! Do you think I’m omnipotent!! Entering the Jingdu Martial Arts Association requires a series of selections and a thorough investigation of one’s identity! If you dare to enter the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, you will definitely be exposed, and I will also be implicated by you!”

Xia Hang almost roared out these words.

A playful smile hung on Qin Yu’s face, and then he said, “Alright, it’s fine if I don’t go in. I heard that your Jingdu Martial Arts Association is going to openly recruit people, right?”

Xia Hang frowned slightly. He thought for a while and nodded. “The Jingdu Martial Arts Association is going to recruit geniuses and use Yan Ruoxue’s blood to activate the bloodline.”

“I want to go in,” Qin Yu said firmly.

Xia Hang frowned and said, “But... there are quotas, and my quotas have already been distributed.”

“Then you have to get them back!” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Xia Hang, you’d better cut the crap. I don’t have that much patience.”

Xia Hang gritted his teeth and said, “I’ll think of a way.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He got up and left.

As he watched Qin Yu’s departing figure, Xia Hang’s uneasiness grew stronger.

“If this continues, I’ll definitely be implicated by him.” Xia Hang took a deep breath.

“I have to think of a way. I can’t be held back by him anymore.” A trace of coldness flashed in Xia Hang’s eyes.

...

The next day.

A piece of news was sent out again.

The six powerhouses recommended by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association were all killed!

And the murderer was that black-robed man!

What was even more shocking was that the corpses of these six people were all hung on the main door of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!
