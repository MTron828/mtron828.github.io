Chapter 453: The Power of a Half-step Martial Marquis Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Looking at Meng Wuxiong, who had stepped into the half-step Martial Marquis Realm, Qin Yu was even more excited!

“This is Han Wei’s realm.” Qin Yu, his eyes filled with unspeakable anticipation, took a deep breath.

However, at this moment, Qin Yu realized that Meng Wuxiong seemed a bit off.

Although he had stepped into the half-step Martial Marquis realm, his internal qi was extremely unstable, as if he would fall to the peak of the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm at any moment.

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer. “I thought you had really stepped into the half-step Martial Marquis realm, but it turns out you’re just a dabbler.”

“It’s enough for me to kill you!” Meng Wuxiong rubbed his fist and said coldly.

It wasn’t that Meng Wuxiong was arrogant, but that the Martial Marquis realm was too powerful.

As long as one was associated with the title ‘Martial Marquis’, it wasn’t something an ordinary Inner Strength Grandmaster could compare to.

“Bring it on. Let me...”

“Bang!”

Before Qin Yu could finish his words, Meng Wuxiong had already thrown a punch at him! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

His speed was so fast that Qin Yu didn’t even have time to react!

With just one punch, Qin Yu’s body had penetrated through several layers of the wall, and his body was covered in cracks!

Qin Yu slowly crawled out from the ruins.

He looked at the injuries on his body and couldn’t help but frown. “This is the power of a half-step Martial Marquis?”

Just one punch already had the power to split mountains!

“Whoosh!”

At this moment, another fist formed from inner strength punched at him!

It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that this punch was no weaker than a modern weapon!

The entire ground instantly turned into ruins!

Qin Yu hurriedly dodged to the side, and a trace of solemnity appeared on his face.

“How strong,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“Qin Yu, you dare to come knocking on my door? You’re dead meat for sure today!” Meng Wuxiong’s angry roar echoed, and in the next second, he appeared in front of Qin Yu!

A fist the size of a casserole punched at him!

Qin Yu had nowhere to hide, so he could only let out an angry roar and meet it head-on!

“Clang!”

The earth-shattering sound startled everyone!

Qin Yu’s fist was almost shattered. The huge impact caused his arm to be deformed!

“Phew!”

The fist that was fused with penetrative force made Qin Yu groan and spit out blood.

“Is this the power of a half-step Martial Marquis?!” Qin Yu ignored the injuries on his body and his eyes revealed a crazed look in his eyes!

After stepping into the half-step Martial Marquis realm, Meng Wuxiong possessed such power. Then, what kind of power would he have when he stepped into the half-step Martial Marquis realm?

“I can’t wait to obtain the secret of your cultivation.” Qin Yu wiped the blood at the corner of his mouth and sneered.

In the next second, Qin Yu didn’t waste any more time. With a roar, the energy in his entire body suddenly boiled!

The golden light around him filled the manor like a rising sun!

This holy light blinded people’s eyes!

“Level three of the Saintly Body Technique!” Facing Meng Wuxiong, who was half a step away from the Martial Marquis Realm, Qin Yu didn’t dare to be negligent and used level three of the Saintly Body Technique!

His body became tougher again, and his whole body seemed to be made of gold!

“It’s useless. Under the difference in cultivation level, any cultivation technique isn’t worth mentioning!” Meng Wuxiong roared and rushed over again!

“Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist!” Qin Yu’s entire body was bursting with energy. His golden fist contained an unimaginable power, and he faced it head-on!

“Boom!”

There was a huge collision. In an instant, the wind and clouds seemed to have lost their color, and a violent gale swept over!

The entire villa couldn’t withstand the pressure and collapsed with a loud bang!

“That’s it?” A cruel smile appeared on the corner of Meng Wuxiong’s mouth.

He suddenly swung his fist, and with a bang, Qin Yu’s entire body was sent flying!

“Pa!”

Qin Yu fell from the high sky and fell heavily to the ground.

Traces of blood dripped out from his mouth, and the light produced by the Saintly Body Technique began to shatter bit by bit!

“How powerful...”

This strike seemed to have injured Qin Yu’s internal organs. Even though Qin Yu’s body was strong, he couldn’t withstand it anymore!

“Qin Yu, isn’t your body indestructible? Today, I will cut open your belly!” Meng Wuxiong laughed cruelly.

Then, two big hands condensed under Qin Yu’s feet!

The big hands were like iron pincers as they grabbed Qin Yu’s body tightly!

Meanwhile, Meng Wuxiong took a step forward and approached him!

“Ripping Finger!”

Along with Meng Wuxiong’s furious roar, a weak light ignited on his fingers.

Although the light was weak, his qi energy was unprecedentedly strong!

When he sensed this qi energy, Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed!

He tried to struggle, but he found that he couldn’t break free at all!

“Go to h*ll!” Meng Wuxiong’s finger stabbed fiercely into Qin Yu’s chest!

Qin Yu’s hard body resisted at this moment!

“Saintly Body Technique!” The huge force made Qin Yu’s face pale!

He didn’t dare to be negligent and activated the Saintly Body Technique in an attempt to resist!

But what was shocking was that Meng Wuxiong’s finger actually penetrated the Saintly Body Technique! Following that, it headed straight for Qin Yu’s physical body!

“Ah!!”

The instant his finger touched him, a piercing pain was felt!

Qin Yu felt as if his chest was being drilled by an electric drill, and the pain was unbearable!

“Phew!”

Finally, Qin Yu’s physical body couldn’t hold on any longer and the finger pierced into his body!

“I want to pull out your internal organs and feed them to the dogs!” Meng Wuxiong said sinisterly.

“Ah!!!” The pain made Qin Yu unable to help but shout at the top of his lungs!

At this critical moment, Qin Yu hurriedly took out the Venerable Fifth Mountain and charged at Meng Wuxiong!

Even Meng Wuxiong didn’t want to take such a magic artifact head on.

He hurriedly took a few steps back, and his fingers left Qin Yu’s body.

“Hehe, your body is indeed impressive, but in my current condition, it’s not worth mentioning.” Meng Wuxiong licked the blood on his fingers and said indifferently.

Qin Yu’s brows were tightly knitted together, and his expression was grave.

A half-step Martial Marquis was even stronger than he had imagined.

If he didn’t have the power of the Divine Dragon, he might really have died here today.

If even Meng Wuxiong was so difficult to deal with, then how powerful was Han Wei, the Young Master of the Han family?

“I’ve been comprehending quite a number of cultivation techniques during this period of time. With the addition of the power of the Divine Dragon, I might have a chance,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“Have you thought about how you’re going to die?” Meng Wuxiong shouted from afar.

Then, he slowly raised his palm.

In an instant, the ground began to shake! The ground under Qin Yu’s feet also began to rumble!

When he raised his head, he saw a huge hand pressing down from all directions!

The huge pressure caused the ground to sink level by level!

And Qin Yu’s body felt like it was about to be smashed into meat paste!
