Chapter 567: The Destruction of the Sacred Confucian Sect Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The Golden Core in Qin Yu’s palm shimmered with light, and a dense spiritual energy was irresistible.

This was a Martial Marquis’ lifetime worth of spiritual energy, and its density was beyond imagination!

With the Golden Core, Qin Yu didn’t even need to rely on the Heaven Swallowing Technique! Moreover, its effect was far above that of the Heaven Swallowing Technique!

Qin Yu caressed the Golden Core, and without wasting any time, he immediately swallowed it!

The golden pill immediately exploded in Qin Yu’s dantian! A dense spiritual energy instantly filled his entire dantian!

“Awesome!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but shout out!

This feeling far surpassed that of a panacea! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

As long as he slaughtered enough Martial Marquises, Qin Yu had no doubt that he would be able to become a Martial Saint in the fastest time possible!

The surrounding people were still gathered here. They looked up at Qin Yu with respect and fear in their eyes.

Qin Yu glanced at them and didn’t stay any longer. He turned around and left.

Gu Canghai was dead.

His miserable appearance before his death also spread!

From then on, it represented the rise of the bottom class’ younger generation!

Qin Yu came all the way to the main hall of the Saint Confucian Sect.

Inside the Saint Confucian Sect, countless people were trembling with fear.

Looking at this young man in front of them, they felt afraid from the bottom of their hearts.

Qin Yu glanced at them and said indifferently, “From today onwards, the Saint Confucian Sect will be renamed as the Green Moon Villa. Those who are willing to stay will be the people of the Green Moon Villa. Those who aren’t willing to stay can leave now.”

Everyone looked at each other and found it difficult to make a decision.

“I’m willing to stay!” At this moment, Deng Sheng shouted!

With Deng Sheng taking the lead, the others also shouted, “I’m also willing to stay!”

Out of the hundreds of people in the Saint Confucian Sect, most chose to stay.

Those who had received Gu Canghai’s favor before naturally left.

...

In the main hall, Qin Yu sat on Gu Canghai’s former seat while holding a few documents in his hands.

These documents were the assets of the Saint Confucian Sect.

Looking at the categories of these assets, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

As expected of the number one sect in the north, the assets under it were simply beyond imagination!

Now, the Green Moon Villa had replaced the Saint Confucian Sect and become the number one sect in the north!

This represented the strongest authority of the martial arts world in the north!

However, Qin Yu also knew very clearly that it was impossible to go against the aristocratic families with just martial strength.

This was because all along, the sects had only been working for the aristocratic families. They were only pawns for the aristocratic families.

If he wanted to truly challenge the Yan family and the Han family, he would also have to gather the powers of various industries.

“Mr. Qin, do you still remember what you said before... that you wanted me to be the Sect Master of the Saint Confucian Sect?” At this moment, Deng Sheng, who was at the side, said with an embarrassed smile.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said indifferently, “Of course I remember.”

Deng Sheng was immediately overjoyed when he heard this. He hurriedly said, “Thank you, Mr. Qin!”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Unfortunately, the Saint Confucian Sect no longer exists. This is the Green Moon Villa.”

Deng Sheng’s expression changed. He probed, “Mr. Qin, what... What do you mean?”

Qin Yu put away the document, stood up and said, “If you are willing to stay, I can give you the position of an elder. If you aren’t willing, you can follow the late Saint Confucian Sect.”

Deng Sheng’s expression was extremely ugly. He never thought that this would be the end result.

After all this time, he was still an elder. There was no change at all.

“I. . . I’m willing to stay.” Deng Sheng had no choice but to submit to him.

Qin Yu ignored him. He called Zhen Yue that day and asked her to take over the Saint Confucian Sect.

In the evening, Zhen Yue brought a few core members of the Green Moon Villa to the Saint Confucian Sect.

Looking at the huge Saint Confucian Sect, Zhen Yue felt that it was a little surreal for a moment.

“Deng Sheng, Zhen Yue is the Sect Master of the Green Moon Villa. From today on, you have to assist her,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Deng Sheng didn’t dare to say anything more. He hurriedly nodded and said, “Yes, Mr. Qin.”

Zhen Yue said awkwardly, “Mr. Qin, let’s forget about it. I’ll give you the position of Sect Master...”

“No, I promised you.” Qin Yu shook his head.

Zhen Yue sighed and didn’t know what to say for a while.

...

Jingdu, Han family.

After recuperating for so many days, Han Wei’s injuries finally healed.

He sat on the sofa, but he was filled with anxiety.

“Dad, quickly arrange training for me. I want to step into the Martial Marquis Realm before Qin Yu!” Han Wei said coldly.

Han Meng walked over from the side while not knowing what to say for a moment.

“Dad, what’s wrong?” After seeing Han Meng’s expression, Han Wei couldn’t help but frown.

Han Meng sighed slightly and said, “Qin Yu... Qin Yu has already stepped into the Martial Marquis Realm. Gu Canghai died in his hands.”

Han Wei suddenly sat up from the sofa!

His eyes widened, and his face was filled with disbelief!

“He... he actually stepped into the Martial Marquis Realm ...” the veins on Han Wei’s forehead bulged, and his fists were clenched tightly!

Han Wei couldn’t figure out how Qin Yu, who he had trampled under his feet last year, could surpass him by so much in such a short period of time!

Han Meng patted Han Wei’s shoulder and said, “Don’t worry. Ma Hai has already set off. It won’t be long before Qin Yu becomes a corpse.”

Although that was the case, Han Wei was still unwilling to accept it.

He thought that he wouldn’t lose to anyone, but now, he was surpassed by a bottom-level person! How could he accept this?!

“Qin Yu... Qin Yu!” Han Wei was extremely angry and couldn’t help but raise his head to roar!

...

Green Moon Villa.

After Qin Yu settled Zhen Yue, he was about to call Yao Qing and ask him and Taozi to come to Green Moon Villa.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s phone rang first.

He picked up the phone and saw that the caller was Teng Gongzi, from Sea City.

Qin Yu picked up the phone and smiled, “Mr. Teng, why are you calling me?”

Teng Gong chuckled, “Qin Yu, I heard that Gu Canghai died? You did well.”

Qin Yu said politely, “Mr. Teng, you flatter me.”

On the other end, Teng Gong indifferently said, “You have quite some ability. I acknowledge you. From today onwards, I will allow you to become a part of the Teng family and work for the Teng family!”

“As long as you have the Teng family as support, you will definitely have the chance to go against the Yan family!”

Qin Yu frowned.

He was silent for a moment and said, “Mr. Teng, are you mistaken? You and I are only partners. I’m not subordinate to the Teng family.”

Teng Gong’s tone immediately became unpleasant.

He said coldly, “Qin Yu, what do you mean by that?”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “I told you clearly from the beginning, right? We are only cooperating to achieve our mutual goals. There is no hierarchy between us.”

Teng Gong said angrily, “Cooperate with me? Someone like you think you can cooperate with me? Qin Yu, even the Saint Confucian Sect was only a subsidiary sect of the Yan family. Now, you want to be on equal footing with me?!”

Qin Yu’s tone gradually became sulky.

“The Saint Confucian Sect is the Saint Confucian Sect, and I’m me. Gu Canghai is willing to be a lap dog, but I’m not willing to,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Well then!” Teng Gong flew into a rage.

He sneered. “I want to see how far you can go without the support of capital!”

“Also, Qin Yu, let me tell you, you have offended me!”
