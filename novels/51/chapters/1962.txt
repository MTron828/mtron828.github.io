1963 The Arrival of Jue Wu

Qin Yu’s injuries were too severe. Although he won the battle against Si Shifeng, he suffered severe injuries from the phantom of the ancient supreme cultivator, which was impossible for him to self-heal at all.

Surrounded by these people now, he soon lost all his strength.

“Hahaha! This kid cannot resist at all,” the guard sneered and said.

“Everyone, there’s no need to make a move. Just watch him collapse on his own.”

!!

“That won’t do. If the famous Qin Yu dies in my hands, I’ll become a powerful figure!”

After saying that, the guard strode toward Qin Yu.

He was full of killing intent and aimed the sharp blade in his hand at Qin Yu’s glabella!

The sharp blade was approaching, but Qin Yu had no way to resist.

He only felt his eyelids grow heavy, and his body suddenly fell.

Just as Qin Yu was about to flake out, a figure suddenly appeared.

“A few b*stards who don’t know their place!”

This familiar voice entered Qin Yu’s ears, but he no longer had the strength to open his eyes. With a “plop”, Qin Yu finally fell to the ground.

“Who are you? How dare you meddle in our business!” one of the cultivators strode forward and scolded.

“I’m your father!” The person cursed angrily, leaping into the air and smashing his head with a slap. It was smooth and clean.

Upon seeing this, everyone’s faces turned extremely ugly!

“Quickly run!” Someone reacted, turned around, and wanted to escape!

“You want to run away? Today, if I don’t chop you up and feed you to the dogs, I’m not called Jue Wu!”

Jue Wu waved her small hand and killed another person!

Such a terrifying speed made everyone present lose their intention to escape.

Someone reacted and knelt on the ground, begging for mercy while trembling, “I… I’m at fault. Please forgive me. I’m… leaving now!”

Jue Wu wasn’t kind-hearted. Thus she wouldn’t be moved by a plea for mercy.

She raised her small hand and in a few moves, she smacked their heads into a pile of meat.

After this, Jue Wu walked to Qin Yu.

She raised her palm and began to transmit spiritual energy to Qin Yu.

With the unique physique of her Nirvana Body, Qin Yu’s internal qi finally stabilized. However, he still showed no signs of waking up.

“Fortunately, I came quickly. Otherwise, something serious would have happened.” Jue Wu picked up Qin Yu. She looked at the city not far away and then at the guard whose head smashed.

When she saw the mark on the guard’s clothes similar to the city, her face turned ferocious again.

“I’ll slaughter you, a bunch of b*stards!” Jue Wu gritted her teeth.

She picked up Qin Yu and headed straight for the city.

Although it was already late at night, there were still guards at the city gate.

Seeing Jue Wu rushing toward them, the guard’s expression changed, and he shouted, “Who are you…”

However, before he could finish his words, his head was twisted off.

This was only the beginning. Jue Wu started a massacre in the city and killed whoever she saw. Almost all the guards in the city couldn’t escape from her vicious hands.

This matter soon alarmed the city lord. He immediately led people into battle. At the same time, he activated the city’s formation in an attempt to suppress Jue Wu.

But now that Jue Wu had mastered the power of the purple cloud pearl, she was almost invincible. Even a Semi-Saint couldn’t stop her, let alone this group of people.

In just an hour, the formation in the city was forcefully broken, and the guards in the city were all killed by Jue Wu.

The city lord’s face turned extremely ugly as he looked at the blood and chaos all over the ground.

At this moment, Jue Wu was like a little demon from hell. Her body which was stained red with blood and emitted terrifying killing intent made the city lord feel terrified. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

However, he was still the city lord, so he suppressed the fear in his heart and said, “My friend, is there a misunderstanding between us? When have I ever offended you?”

Jue Wu’s face darkened as she said, “Don’t talk nonsense with me. I’m here today to massacre the city.”

After saying that, Jue Wu put Qin Yu on the ground.

After seeing Qin Yu’s face clearly, the city lord said in surprise, “You… You’re from the Si family?”

“My a*s!” Jue Wu cursed. “You tried to assassinate Qin Yu in the suburbs. If I hadn’t arrived in time, I’m afraid Qin Yu would have already become a corpse!”

“How is that possible?” The city lord’s expression changed and he explained anxiously, “My friend, there must be some misunderstanding between us. When have I ever had the intention to kill Qin Yu?”

“I saw it with my own eyes. How could it be fake?” Jue Wu gritted her canine teeth, revealing her ferocity.

The city lord hurriedly said, “There must be a misunderstanding! If you don’t believe me, you can wait for Qin Yu to wake up and ask him!”

“F*ck! Don’t even think about stalling for time. You want to call for rescue, do you? I’m going to kill you right now!” After cursing, Jue Wu came in front of the city lord with a “whoosh.”

Facing Jue Wu, the city lord didn’t have the slightest ability to resist. He could only hurriedly explain and tell Jue Wu what had happened.

“Someone must have tried to curry favor with the Si family! I remember now!” At this time, the city lord was as if grabbing a life-saving straw.

He said hurriedly, “Today, someone did suggest to me to hand Qin Yu over to the Si family, but I rejected it. He must be the one behind this! This matter has nothing to do with me!”

Jue Wu frowned and felt he didn’t seem to be lying.

“How about this? You keep an eye on me for the next few days. Before Qin Yu wakes up, I won’t leave your side. How about that?” the city lord said in a panic.

Jue Wu touched her chin, stared at Qin Yu, and muttered, “This guy doesn’t seem to like me killing innocents…”

Thinking of this, Jue Wu waved her hand and said, “Fine, from now onward, you’ll be by my side. If you dare to play any tricks, I’ll pull out your tendons and skin you!”

...

“Sure! Sure!” The city lord’s forehead was sweating profusely as he hurriedly said.

Jue Wu snorted, carried Qin Yu on her back, and walked into the Great Hall.

The city lord’s back was covered in a cold sweat. He looked at Jue Wu’s back and felt extremely frightened.

“Who exactly is this little thing? She’s so brutal…” the city lord said, trembling.

Even so, the city Lord still followed her.

In the following few days, Jue Wu enjoyed eating and drinking in the city, but the city lord had been reduced to Jue Wu’s servant. He was busy all day, serving tea and pouring wine for Jue Wu, and never dared to leave her side.

It went on for eight full days.

On the eighth day, Qin Yu finally woke up.

He got up from the side of the bed with tremendous difficulty. As soon as he opened his eyes, he saw Jue Wu eating and drinking lavishly.
