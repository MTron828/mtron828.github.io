2282 Enjoy While You Can

“Therefore, it would be easier to comprehend the same dao technique in the Holy Region, and the power of rules comprehended would also be more complete and powerful.”

Elder Guai said softly as if he was telling a story.

It was also the first time Xiaoru and Little Fatty heard about this. The two of them sat beside Qin Yu and listened attentively.

“But I have a question. When I came to this galaxy back then, the peak of the Holy Region was probably only True Saint. They were far inferior to the top cultivators of this galaxy. Why is it so?”

Qin Yu asked curiously. At that time, it was already at the peak of the Holy Region when Si Liuhe broke through to the True Saint.

However, he discovered many True Saints in contradiction while he was in purgatory.

“Qin Yu, have you seen a tsunami before?”

Elder Guai asked with a faint smile.

Qin Yu suddenly understood.

“The longer the waves accumulate, the higher the final eruption. This galaxy is equivalent to the waves of a past era. The power of the Path of Heaven has descended upon this place for three thousand years. The ultimate eruption is taking place in the Holy Region. If I am not mistaken, the True Saint cultivators in the Holy Region now are definitely multiplying rapidly like bamboo shoots after spring rain. In a short time, they have surpassed the number of True Saint cultivators in this galaxy.”

Elder Guai explained in detail to Qin Yu.

“I roughly understand now.”

Qin Yu gasped, as this meant that the longer he stayed here, the more unfavorable it might become.

“Moreover, the fifth grade of True Saint is a hurdle. From the first to the fourth grade and from the sixth to the ninth grade, one can easily accumulate an immense amount of spiritual energy. I believe that this can be effortlessly achieved in the Holy Region, but it’s a challenging feat in our galaxy. I think you already have some understanding of this.”

Elder Guai shook his head. He knew Qin Yu was returning to the Holy Region, so he had to explain everything.

“Furthermore, once the power of the Path of Heaven descends again, the cultivators can break through to the Tribulation Transcending Stage, and the gap will be even wider. After tribulation is Immortal Emperor. An Immortal Emperor is an existence that can surpass the dao technique of the world and create his own dao techniques. It was also the peak of cultivation.”

Qin Yu’s expression was ugly. During this period, he obtained the Suo Lin Divine Artifact, and his cultivation also improved by leaps and bounds.

He even felt happy secretly that he had the upper hand in the battle with Situ Haoyue, a veteran cultivator. However, after hearing Elder Guai’s words, he immediately felt overwhelmed.

Perhaps Si Shiyue and the others had made greater progress in the Holy Region than him.

“The peak means chaos. Every year of the Path of Heaven is like this, ending in immense chaos. Regardless of the people of the demon race, cultivators, or all other races, nine out of ten die. Nearly all cultivators are unable to escape this chaos. Those who survive will usher in a new cycle of the Path of Heaven, and it’s the beginning of the Path of Heaven. It can’t be altered, nor can it be avoided.”

Elder Guai sighed. The chaos had left him with a lingering fear.

“Thank you, Elder Guai.”

Qin Yu respectfully bowed to Elder Guai. Elder Guai’s words completely dispelled his arrogance.

Ever since he knew this tree demon, he had always been a teacher and friend to Qin Yu.

He was also severely injured because of him, only because of his father’s friendship.

“Haha, without your father, I would have died long ago. If you feel guilty, enjoy a few drinks with me today. We’ll drink until I’m satisfied!”

Elder Guai stroked his white beard and laughed heartily. He looked very free and easy.

“Alright, three of us won’t go home until we’re drunk!”

Qin Yu also laughed heartily. He took out the fine wine he had plundered from the Azure Firmament Sect.

A strong aroma of wine spread throughout the entire Sumeru ring.

“Cheers!”

The three large bowls clashed together with force, and the fiery crafted brew was downed in a single gulp.

No one used their spiritual energy to force out the alcohol. After drinking much, Wang Feng was spinning in circles, saying he wanted to catch Xiaoru and Little Fatty to drink with him.

“Come and catch me, Uncle Wang Feng, hahaha!”

Xiaoru and Little Fatty were playing wildly as they teased Wang Feng.

Little Fatty poked Wang Feng’s buttock and ran away quickly.

“Little Fatty, you’re looking for a beating!”

Fuming with anger, Wang Feng wanted to chase after Little Fatty but accidentally slipped and fell flat on his face. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The two of them laughed crazily and jumped around Wang Feng.

Qin Yu was chatting with Elder Guai about his and Ruoxue’s matters in the Holy Region and his drinking with Wen Da and Wen Er. His eyes slowly became moist.

“Cheers, Elder Guai!”

Qin Yu picked up the bowl and drank another big bowl of hard liquor.

He did not know when he had fallen into a deep sleep. This was the first time he had fallen into a deep sleep in this galaxy.

The following day, Qin Yu looked at the few people sleeping all over the place with a bewildered expression. Little Fatty’s buttock was sitting on Wang Feng’s face while sleeping soundly, Xiaoru was hugging his thigh tightly and sleeping, and Elder Guai was snoring and hugging a tree.

Qin Yu gently placed Xiaoru’s hand down and left the Sumeru ring.

“Lady Boss!”

Qin Yu came to the hall and found Ji Yue.

“Hey, Mr. Qin. I heard that your harvest in purgatory this time was quite substantial. Right now, no less than a hundred pairs of eyes were staring at you.”

Ji Yue said with a smile.

“May I ask if you have a way to go to the Holy Region?”

Qin Yu did not respond to what Ji Yue had said.

“Mr. Qin must be joking. There wouldn’t be so many cultivators staying here if going to the Holy Region is so simple.”

Ji Yue covered her mouth, laughed, and said.

“Is there really no way?”

Qin Yu asked seriously.

Seeing Qin Yu not seem to be joking, Ji Yue stopped smiling.

“You should know that Holy Region is a high-level galaxy. The amount of spiritual energy required to teleport over there is tens of thousands of times greater than they teleport to here. This galaxy can’t withstand such consumption of spiritual energy.”

Ji Yue said with a frown.

“A thousand years ago, a Formation Master created a spatial teleportation formation on the continent. It was a spatial teleportation formation that could absorb the internal qi of the void and save a lot of spiritual energy.”

“Is it Chang Ye?”

Qin Yu asked.

“You know Chang Ye? At that time, with the help of the three major sects, Chang Ye connected the teleportation formation to a few spiritual energy Mystic Realms. Coupled with the spirit essence of the three major sects, he actually managed to gather enough spiritual energy to go to the Holy Region. However, Chang Ye exhausted 70% to 80% of his body’s spiritual energy after shuttling. In the end, he was defeated by the formation guardian of the Holy Region and came back.”

Ji Yue shook her head. There was no way to go to the Holy Region at the moment.

Seeing the disappointment on Qin Yu’s face, Ji Yue continued.

“Of course, there are some rumors, but you need to pay to listen to the story.”

Ji Yue said with a smile.

“How much?”

Qin Yu asked with a vigilant expression. He did not have a single spirit essence on him now.

“Ten pieces of spirit essence.”

Ji Yue said with a smile.

“Why don’t you go and rob?”

Qin Yu cursed.
