Chapter 923: Chapter 923, Stealing Spirit Stones? ! 

Just as Qin Yu was about to take out the two corpses to fight, Zhai Xing suddenly stepped forward and blocked in front of both sides.

“Enough,”Zhai Xing said coldly.

Uncle Zhen and the others frowned slightly. Although they were somewhat displeased, they did not dare to be angry at Zhai Xing.

“Lord Zhai Xing, do you intend to protect this person?”Uncle Otter said coldly.

Zhai Xing glanced at him and said, “If you continue fighting, you will definitely destroy this spirit stone mine.”

Uncle Otter snorted coldly. Although he was displeased, he did not say anything.

Uncle Zhen looked at Xu Huaigu coldly and said, “On account of Lord Zhai Xing, we can spare you, but you must scram immediately! This spirit stone mine has nothing to do with you!”

As soon as these words were said, everyone looked at Xu Huaigu.

Xu Huaigu looked at Uncle Zhen quietly and said, “The Spirit Stone Mine is a treasure of Heaven and earth. It should belong to the people of the world. What right do we have to leave? And what right do we have to give up?”

“You’re courting death!”Uncle Otter said angrily.

“Don’t be shameless! A treasure of the world? Do you have the strength to do so!”

“If we don’t give it to you, what can you do? !”

Xu Huaigu calmly said, “If you don’t give it to us, we will definitely fight until you are willing to talk to us as equals.”

These words immediately fiercely touched Qin Yu’s heart.

His words directly hit Qin Yu’s heart.

“Hehe, then we will kill you now. Let’s see how you will fight back!”Uncle Otter and the others once again made their way over!

Right at this moment, Gu Xinghe took a step forward and calmly said, “The Jingdu Martial Arts Association will be responsible for the distribution of the Spirit Stone Mine.”

Everyone looked at Gu Xinghe, their eyes filled with suspicion.

Gu Xinghe calmly said, “Three days later, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association will hold a meeting to discuss the distribution of the Spirit Stone Mine.”

“At that time, I will mediate the conflict for everyone.”

Gu Xinghe was Gu Zizhen’s son. Since he had spoken, Uncle Otter and the others naturally did not dare to say anything.

This battle seemed to have been suppressed for the time being.

However, everyone knew very well that this was only temporary.

Relying on flattery and flattery would definitely not allow one to obtain equal power.

If one wanted to have an equal conversation, the prerequisite was to have equal strength.

“Alright, everyone can leave for now,”Gu Xinghe said.

“Young Master Gu, I hope you can uphold the principle of fairness,”someone said coldly.

The crowd retreated like a tide.

Xu Huaigu did not stay any longer. He swept his gaze across the crowd and slowly left.

“Xu Huaigu! I’ll let you off this time, but I’m not sure if I’ll let you off next time!”Uncle Otter shouted from behind.

“Three days from now, it’ll be your time to die!”Uncle Zhen also coldly berated.

Xu Huaigu did not say a word and left the place in a few steps.

Staring at the crowd present, Qin Yu’s heart was filled with worry.

He coldly swept his gaze over these martial artists from the mystic realm, a strong killing intent in his heart.

“Friend, thank you for your help.”At this moment, Zhuang Teng and Chang Mang walked over.

Qin Yu bowed slightly and didn’t say anything.

“Friend, if you don’t mind, why don’t you go to my residence for a chat?”Zhuang Teng continued to invite him.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, then shook his head and said, “I still have something to do, so I won’t go.”

After saying that, Qin Yu planned to leave.

At this time, Chang Mang blocked Qin Yu’s path.

He sized up Qin Yu and said, “Friend, you should be careful. These martial artists in the Mystic Realm won’t let you off.”

“I know, thank you.”Qin Yu subconsciously wanted to Pat Chang Mang’s sword light, but in the end, he put his hand down.

He did not dare to stay any longer and turned around to leave this large mine.

Qin Yu knew very well that the conversation three days later would definitely be an unfair conversation.

At that time, a great battle would definitely erupt!

And no one knew if those seven martial saints would attack at the same time.

“With Xu Huaigu alone, I’m afraid it would be difficult to resist these seven martial saints.”Qin Yu could not help but think to himself.

After thinking for a while, Qin Yu decided to think of a way to resurrect those two corpses!

If he had these two corpses, even these seven martial saints would not be worth mentioning.

“If only the handlebar mustache was here.”Qin Yu thought to himself.

“Yes! Handlebar Mustache!”

Qin Yu slapped his head. He had actually forgotten about him!

With his personality, he would definitely not miss out on this spirit stone mine!

As long as there was a babe, there would definitely be his figure, not to mention such a big mine that had spread all over the country!

After thinking about it, Qin Yu planned to hide in the dark and look for the figure of the handlebar mustache.

...

The next day.

Qin Yu stood far away from the spirit stone mine and secretly looked at the vicinity of the big mine.

Until noon, Qin Yu still did not see the figure of the handlebar mustache.

“Strange.”Qin Yu could not help but frown.

Could it be that this was a change in character? He could miss even the spirit stone mine?

“Impossible.”Qin Yu shook his head.

The handlebar mustache would miss anything, but the treasure would definitely not be missed.

Thus, Qin Yu planned to continue waiting.

At this moment.

A wretched figure appeared in Qin Yu’s line of sight.

He looked at his surroundings with a crafty expression and crept up the mountain peak.

His posture was extremely similar to a thief who was planning to steal something.

“I’ve finally waited for you.”Qin Yu could not help but heave a sigh of relief.

However, he was not in a hurry to look for him. Instead, he wanted to see what the handlebar mustache wanted to do.

On the peak of the mountain.

The handlebar mustache carefully looked at his surroundings and unleashed his wretched aura to the maximum.

After making sure that no one around him noticed him, he took out a pile of magical artifacts and strange-looking materials and anxiously gestured something on the peak of the mountain.

At this moment, Qin Yu carefully came to his back and patted his shoulder.

“F * ck!”

The mustachioed man was so scared that he staggered and almost fell to the ground.

He looked at Qin Yu with a terrified face and said with an embarrassed smile, “What’s the matter, fellow Daoist?”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes at him and said, “What are you doing here sneakily?”

The mustachioed man coughed and said, “I saw that the scenery here was very good, so I wanted to come up and take a look.”

“TSK TSK, do you think the Sun is beautiful? Do the branches over there look good?”

“F * CK Your Grandpa.”Qin Yu rolled his eyes.

He pointed at the various materials on the ground and said, “What are these things?”

“Uh... This is just a pile of stones. I think it looks pretty good here,”the moustache man said shamelessly.

Qin Yu glared at him and said, “Mustache Man, what are you trying to do? Quickly tell me!”

The mustache man muttered, “I’m not doing anything. I... Huh? What did you call me?”

Looking at the mustache man who suddenly reacted, qin yu said softly, “I’m Qin Yu. Don’t make it public.”

“F * ck!”The Mustache Man glared.

“F * ck, you’re scaring me to Death!”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “Cut the crap. What do you want? Tell me quickly!”

“I really didn’t do anything. I’m just here to enjoy the scenery,”the man with the handlebar mustache said with a smile.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Okay, I’ll go tell Gu Xinghe now.”

After saying this, Qin Yu made a gesture to leave.

Seeing this, the mustached man hurriedly stopped Qin Yu.

“Okay, everyone who sees it will have a share,”the mustached man said helplessly.

“To tell you the truth, this is the latest spatial spell I’ve developed.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said in surprise, “Spatial spell? What are you doing?”

The mustached man said with a smile, “After this big spirit stone mine opens, I can wait for an opportunity to pass through this spatial formation.”

“Steal Spirit Stones?”Qin Yu’s eyes flashed with a trace of surprise.
