Chapter 1500: Chapter 1,500, scheming against each other

At this moment, in the Heavenly Cloud Sect, the first elder’s expression was extremely unsightly.

“The matter has been exposed.”The first Elder’s face was as dark as water.

At this moment, Di Zun walked out from the darkness.

He stood beside the first elder and said, “First Elder, why must we fight to the death with Qin Yu? Shouldn’t we set our sights on the border now?”

First Elder glanced at Di zun and then snorted, “To resist the foreign forces, you must first settle the internal affairs. If I don’t kill him, he will definitely come to me in the future.”

Di zun hurriedly said, “I can act as a middleman and negotiate for you!”

“Negotiate?”First elder sneered, “Di Zun, you are too naive. He will definitely not let me off.”

Di Zun patted his chest and said, “First Elder, believe me. I will be the middleman. I will be able to settle this matter!”

First Elder opened his mouth and was about to say something when another thought suddenly appeared in his mind.

First Elder narrowed his eyes. After a moment, he put on a smile and looked at Di Zun.

“Di Zun, actually, I don’t want to be in a stalemate with him. If there’s a chance, I’m willing to negotiate with him.”First Elder pretended to sigh.

Di zun immediately said, “First Elder, are you telling the truth?”

“Absolutely!”First Elder patted his chest and said.

Di zun hurriedly said, “First elder, leave this matter to me. I’ll go find him!”

First Elder said in a deep voice, “Are you sure that Qin Yu will listen to You?”

“I’m confident!”Di Zun hurriedly said.

First Elder sighed slightly and said, “Good! Then I’ll leave this matter to you. As long as you can persuade him, I’m willing to meet him and have a talk.”

Di zun immediately said, “Good. First Elder, don’t worry. I’ll set off for Mount Hua Ning now!”

Not long after, Di Zun left the Heavenly Cloud sect and went to Mount Hua Ning to look for Qin Yu.

First Elder looked at Di Zun’s back and could not help but sneer.

“You’re still too young after all,”first elder sneered.

At this moment, the deputy sect master walked over from the side.

“You plan to use this opportunity to get rid of Qin Yu?”The deputy sect master asked.

First Elder said indifferently, “Not only to get rid of Qin Yu, I also want to drive a wedge between Di Zun and Qin Yu.”

The deputy sect master opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something, but in the end, he did not say anything.

“Immediately gather the eighteen gods. This time, we must kill him no matter what!”First Elder said coldly.

Other than the eighteen gods, first elder also decided to personally bring the virtual entity to kill Qin Yu!

With two levels of protection, even if Qin Yu had great abilities, he would not be able to escape!

...

Mount Hua Ning.

After Jue Wu left, this place became Qin Yu’s cultivation ground.

As for Wen Da and Wen Er, they drank and enjoyed themselves every day.

Even Jue Wu’s two attendants had been corrupted by Wen Da and Wen Er.

“It’s a pity that Jue Wu left,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Right now, Qin Yu was extremely secretive about the information regarding the South Prefecture. Most of it was because of Jue Wu.

Without Jue Wu, Qin Yu planned to look for Zhuo Jing and get him to scout out the news. He wanted to find a big graves to cultivate and strive to step into the mighty realm in one fell swoop.

Just as Qin Yu was about to leave, he suddenly felt that someone was approaching. Furthermore, the aura of the person was not weak. Qin Yu’s internal Qi was not weak.

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed slightly. He immediately activated his desolate divine eyes and looked into the distance.

“Eh? Di Zun?”Qin Yu was stunned. He was immediately shocked!

Why did he come here?

Qin Yu did not think too much and immediately walked out quickly.

In a short while, Di Zun arrived in front of Qin Yu.

“Master.”

After seeing Qin Yu, Di Zun quickly walked forward.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Why did you come here? How could the first elder bear to let you leave?”

Di zun sighed and said, “Master, I came here this time... to be a lobbyist.”

“Lobbyist? What do you mean?”Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Di Zun said in a deep voice, “Now that the people of the northern land have entered the South Province and all the ambitious people have gone to the border, I think that you and the Tianyun sect should unite against the outside world for the time being and not waste too much energy on each other.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “Do you want me to forgive the first elder?”

“No.”Di Zun shook his head and said, “He killed Zhen Yue. Even I won’t forgive him, let alone you.”

Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief.

Fortunately, this kid didn’t lose his conscience.

“We should fight side by side now. After we solve the problem in the northern land, we’ll settle the personal grudges between the two of you,”Di Zun said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “You think the first elder will let me go? A few days ago, he sent someone to kill me.”

Di zun hurriedly said, “Master, the first elder sent me here. He also wants to talk to you.”

“He sent you here?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

With the first elder’s temperament, how could he think so far ahead?

If he really wanted to do so, he wouldn’t have sent people to kill him a few days ago. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Really!”Di Zun patted his chest and said.

“Master, believe me. The invasion of the northern land is so serious now. As the number one sect in the southern region, he naturally bears the brunt of it. Right now, he hopes that you can unite against the outside world,”Di Zun said earnestly.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, and then asked, “Then what do you want me to do?”

Di Zun was immediately overjoyed when he heard that. He hurriedly said, “I’ll pick a place and you guys can talk about it in person. How about it?”

“Sure.”Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “But I have a condition.”

Di Zun nodded repeatedly and said, “No problem! Ten conditions are fine!”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “I’ll pick the place and the time.”

“No Problem!”Di Zun said hurriedly.

“Master, I’ll go back and inform the first elder!”

“Wait.”Qin Yu stopped di zun and said, “Go back and tell him that we’ll meet in Yin Palace in ten days.”

“Okay!”Di Zun nodded.

He didn’t stay any longer and left immediately.

After he had gone far away, Wen Dajin came forward and muttered, “Qin Yu, do you really believe him? This kid might have been sent by the first elder to lie to you.”

“That’s right, that’s right. With the first Elder’s character, he would definitely take the opportunity to make a move on you,”Wen er added.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Di Zun wouldn’t do that, but... he might have been deceived by the first elder.”

“Then why did you agree to him?”Wen da frowned.

Qin Yu sneered, “Since I dared to agree to him, I naturally have a countermeasure. Don’t worry.”

Then, Qin Yu looked at Wen Da and Wen er and said, “The two of you stay here and don’t go anywhere. I’ll go to Yin Palace now.”

“You really want to go?”Wen da frowned.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “There will be an end between us sooner or later. He wants to take the opportunity to kill me, and I also want to take the opportunity to kill him!”
