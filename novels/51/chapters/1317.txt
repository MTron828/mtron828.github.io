When Chen Cang heard this, he only laughed and waved his hand. “That place isn’t for you to go to. Don’t ask.”

Qin Yu hurriedly said, “Old Mister Chen, you just need to tell me the place. Is that okay?”

Chen Cang said in a deep voice, “I don’t want to see you send yourself to your death.”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and wanted to say something, but Chen Cang waved his hand and interrupted him.

“You won’t tell me. If you have nothing else to say, you can leave now.”Chen Cang gave the order to leave.

Qin Yu suddenly had a bad feeling. He thought for a moment, then smiled and said, “Okay, I won’t ask. Then can I be a guest here?”

“Of course. You are welcome to visit the Chen family,”said Chen Cang.

Then, he asked his men to arrange a room for Qin Yu.

Qin Yu naturally had his own plans. If Chen Cang didn’t say anything, his family might tell him.

In short, as long as he stayed, there was definitely hope.

Just as Qin Yu was about to follow the maidservant to their residence, he met Wan ‘er and Ah San.

The moment he saw Qin Yu, ah San’s expression changed slightly.

He quickly moved forward and blocked Qin Yu’s path.

“I actually let you get ahead of me,”Ah San said coldly.

“Ah San, don’t be rude!”Wan ‘er hurriedly reprimanded.

However, this time, ah San did not listen to Wan ‘Er’s orders. Instead, he looked coldly at Qin Yu and said, “Hand over your life force and I’ll spare your life!”

Qin Yu’s expression also slowly turned cold.

“You’ve already provoked me many times. I’ve endured it for the sake of your family’s miss. If you dare to yell at me again, I Won’t give face to anyone,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Ah San sneered and said, “If it’s the same, I will return it to you. If you don’t hand over the life Qi, I will not listen to anyone’s orders!”

Just as the two of them were at daggers drawn, Chen Cang walked out from inside.

“You are also here to look for the life Qi, right?”Chen Cang said indifferently.

Hearing this, Wan ‘er hurriedly walked forward, cupped her hands and said, “Greetings, old Mister Chen.”

Chen Cang helplessly waved his hand and said, “Don’t waste your energy. I Won’t give you the life force.”

Ah San frowned slightly. He stared at Qin Yu and said, “You didn’t get the life force? Why didn’t you say it?”

“Why the F * ck should I say it?”Qin Yu held back his anger and pushed Ah San away.

“Miss Wan ‘er, control your people, or you will easily get into trouble.”

After saying this, Qin Yu followed the maidservant to the residence.

On the same day.

Qin Yu began to ask the Chen family members.

But to Qin Yu’s surprise, no one in the entire Chen family knew where Chen Cang’s life force came from.

Even Chen Cang’s own son knew nothing about this.

This immediately made Qin Yu feel troubled.

Could it be that this trip was really for nothing?

If sister Lin had not introduced him, Qin Yu would have wanted to kill him and steal his goods.

“No matter what, I must find the life force,”Qin Yu said coldly.

At this moment, there was a knock on the door.

“Young Master Qin, are you asleep?”Wan ‘er’s voice came from outside.

Qin Yu got up and opened the door.

“Miss Wan ‘Er, why are you here?”Qin Yu moved aside and welcomed her into the room.

Wan ‘er smiled and said, “Of course it’s for the Qi of life.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “Chen Cang really didn’t give me the Qi of life.”

Wan ‘er quickly nodded and said, “Young Master Qin, of course I believe your words. I came to find you this time because I want to discuss with you about the source of the Qi of life.”

“The Source?”Qin Yu sighed. “This Chen Cang doesn’t plan to tell us at all.”

Wan ‘er agreed and said, “He is also unwilling to tell me. He claims that he is afraid that something will happen to us and doesn’t want us to send ourselves to our deaths.”

Qin Yu grunted and waited for Wan ‘er to continue.

Wan ‘er continued, “Before I came, I did a detailed study of Yang City.”

She took out a map. This map was actually a detailed map of Yang City.

On the map, there were drawn lines with beautiful handwriting. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Young Master Qin, please take a look,”wan ‘er said. “Chen Cang said that he was afraid that something would happen to us. That means that the places where the aura of life appears must be extremely dangerous.”

“And in the entire Yang City, there are only two places that might pose a threat to us.”

Qin Yu followed Wan ‘Er’s finger and saw that she had drawn two places.

One was the huge river at the entrance of Yang City.

The other place was the mountain range on the upper side of Yang City.

“So you guessed that the life energy must be in these two places?”Qin Yu said in surprise.

Wan ‘er smiled and said, “There’s a very high probability.”

Qin Yu touched his chin and said, “What if the life energy doesn’t come from Yang City at all? For example, what if Chen Cang got it when he was traveling? As far as I know, Chen Cang often leaves Yang City.”

Wan ‘er nodded repeatedly and said, “This is the crux of the problem, so we can use these two places to test it out tomorrow.”

“If Chen Cang doesn’t say anything, we can only take the risk to explore these two places.”

“I believe that Chen Cang will also see our determination because of this. If he is really afraid that something will happen to us, he will definitely tell us the source of the aura of life.”
