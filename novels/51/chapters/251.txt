Chapter 252: Taking Advantage of the Situation Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Han Yilong, you’ve always looked down on so-called martial artists. What about now?” Qin Yu walked in front of Han Yilong and said coldly.

Han Yilong was so scared that he almost wet his pants. His lips trembled as he said, “You can’t kill me. I’m a member of the Han family. I...”

“Bang!”

Before Han Yilong could finish his words, Qin Yu raised his finger and crushed Han Yilong’s knee!

The people around him were already numb to it. Qin Yu was too ruthless. No matter what identity or background one had, no matter who tried to persuade him, it was useless.

As long as they provoked him, they would definitely pay the price.

Han Yilong held his knee. Because of fear, his entire body was trembling.

Qin Yu sneered. “What bullsh * t Han Family? Do you think I’m afraid?”

“I was wrong. I was wrong... I beg you to spare me...” Han Yilong, looking a little pitiful, was crying his eyes out.

Qin Yu said coldly, “You young masters of aristocratic families think that you can manipulate others just because you have a powerful background. Let me tell you, not everyone will bow down to you.”

“Remember to be a good person in your next life.”

After saying that, Qin Yu crushed Han Yilong’s head with his big hand!

The young master of the Han family was tortured to death!

Although he was from a side branch, as long as he was related to the Han family, no one would dare to provoke him.

But today, this rule was broken.

The people around all kept quiet. No one dared to provoke this terminator.

“Mr. Qin, can... can you spare my life?” Han Yilong’s follower asked respectfully.

Qin Yu glanced at him and sneered. “Don’t worry, I won’t kill you. I still need you to go back and report the news.”

Report the news?

Not only did Qin Yu not avoid letting the news leak, but he even wanted the Han family to know about it?

“Go back and tell Han Wei that I’m definitely going to marry Yan Ruoxue! No one can snatch her away!” Qin Yu said coldly.

The underling hurriedly cupped his hands and said, “Yes, Yes, Mr. Qin. I’ll definitely deliver the message.”

Qin Yu no longer paid attention to the underling. His eyes looked at the high mountain not far away.

That was the place where the Divine Medicine would be born.

Qin Yu took a deep breath, then looked at Jiang Gu and said, “Follow me.”

“Yes!” Jiang Gu was the most excited one.

Qin Yu’s performance today had far exceeded his imagination!

All along, Chuzhou had been extremely weak in the Jiang Bei region.

Qin Yu’s appearance could very possibly change this situation.

Everyone watched Qin Yu’s back as he left and were unable to react for a moment.

“Should we follow him?” Duan Shi asked.

“Of course,” Jing Lu snorted lightly.

“After this battle, how much stamina do you think Qin Yu has left?” Jing Lu raised his brows and asked.

Duan Shi’s expression changed, and he probed, “You mean...”

“A man must act according to the situation.” Jing Lu snorted coldly, and then rushed forward.

Just as Jing Lu said, Qin Yu’s internal qi was indeed somewhat diminished.

Even though he had borrowed the strength of the Earth Fiend Valley’s ancestor, a long battle still caused Qin Yu’s internal qi to drop rapidly.

“Mr. Qin, I really didn’t expect you to have such strength!” Jiang Gu flattered him non-stop along the way.

However, Qin Yu’s expression was cold, and no one knew what he was thinking.

“I’m afraid that someone will attack me later.” Qin Yu suddenly turned to look at Jiang Gu.

Jiang Gu was stunned, and he said with a sheepish smile, “That can’t be. These people should have been scared out of their wits...”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “As long as there are enough benefits, people will be emboldened.”

“Moreover... I’m not in a good condition right now,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

The Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist consumed a lot of energy, which was why Qin Yu didn’t use it easily.

They were getting closer and closer to the place where the Divine Medicine would be born, and the others soon caught up with them.

In the valley, there were dots of light.

Qin Yu’s pupils shrank, and he almost saw through the entire valley!

His internal qi was released in an instant, and it covered more than half of the valley.

Following that, the corners of Qin Yu’s mouth curled up.

“As expected of a Divine Medicine. Interesting.” The gloominess on Qin Yu’s expression was swept away and replaced by confidence.

“Mr. Qin really had the appearance of a God descending to Earth just now.” At this moment, Fang Yue caught up.

Qin Yu glanced at her and smiled nonchalantly. “Miss Fang, you must be joking.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Fang Yue covered her mouth and said, “Just now, I didn’t lend a hand to save you. Mr. Qin, you won’t blame me, right?”

Qin Yu shook his head. “You and I don’t have deep feelings for each other. If you were to really help out, that would make me feel suspicious.”

“That’s good.” Fang Yue smiled.

“Mr. Qin, you’ve made enemies everywhere. You won’t have an easy way down this path in the future,” Fang Yue reminded.

Qin Yu said with a calm expression, “Which almighty expert hasn’t overcome all obstacles along the way? If everything goes smoothly, you won’t go too far down the path.”

“Mr. Qin, you’re really full of lofty sentiments.”

At this moment, Jing Lu also followed.

He cupped his hands towards Qin Yu and said, “Mr. Qin, we’ve really underestimated you. In front of you, even the four great geniuses are eclipsed.”

Qin Yu didn’t have a good impression of Jing Lu.

This person was too scheming and liked to exploit others.

Therefore, Qin Yu only nodded to him.

“It seems that this Divine Medicine will belong to Mr. Qin,” Jing Lu continued.

“Not necessarily,” Qin Yu replied quietly.

“I’m not the only one who wants this Divine Medicine.”

Jing Lu smiled and said, “Who dares to snatch it from Mr. Qin?”

Qin Yu ignored Jing Lu and didn’t go to get the medicine.

Jing Lu retreated to the side, but his eyes narrowed slightly.

“Qin Yu’s internal qi is completely exhausted. Now is a good time to kill him,” Jing Lu said coldly.

Duan Shi hurriedly asked, “Is what you said true?”

Jing Lu snorted lightly and said, “It’s absolutely true! Later, you and I will kill him together! You and I will split the Divine Medicine equally!”

“Okay!” Duan Shi hurriedly nodded.

Besides Jing Lu, Dong Tianhai’s brows also furrowed slightly.

“Qin Yu has killed so many people. As the President of the Martial Arts Association, don’t you have anything to say?” Dong Tianhai glanced at Wan Xin.

Wan Xin said awkwardly, “I... I will report it.”

“Humph, what a piece of trash.” Dong Tianhai snorted coldly.

At this moment, the light in the valley erupted again! It was going to come out at any time!

“Now, kill him!” Jing Lu said viciously.

“Okay!” Duan Shi took the lead and took a step forward before throwing a punch at Qin Yu from behind!

“Pfft!”

With this punch, Qin Yu spat out a mouthful of blood!

Duan Shi was instantly overjoyed. He rubbed his fist and sneered. “Qin Yu, it seems that you’re exhausted.”

Qin Yu turned around and looked at Duan Shi coldly. “Sneak attack from behind?”

“Hahaha! So what even if we fight head-on?!” Duan Shi snorted.

“I have been a prodigy since I was a child, so how can I be inferior to you?!”

“I will kill you now!” After saying that, Duan Shi swung his fist!

At this moment, a light gauze robe floated over, and Duan Shi’s fist immediately tilted to the side.
