“If we were in the land of the third mark, there is a high chance that this team can save your life. However, I can’t give you any guarantees if you reach the land of the fourth mark. Perhaps you can only depend on yourself because no one has ever been there. Even I don’t know what you will face there.”

Cang Yunzi said seriously.

“Taoist priest, what’s your suggestion?”

Qin Yu frowned and asked.

“I suggest that you don’t enter the fourth level. My life is going to end soon. This trip to the Heavenly Sin is also my last chance. However, you are still young. You can come into contact with the curse of the Heavenly Sin internal qi within the third level. At that time, you won’t have to worry about being pursued by Heavenly Sin anymore.” Cang Yunzi’s expression was grim.

“We’ll see when the time comes.”

Qin Yu was also a little hesitant.

If he could come into contact with the curse at the third level, he had to assess the situation at the fourth level.

If it were a place where one would die for sure, then it would be foolish to insist on going.

“The Tomb of Heavenly Sins is ever-changing. Hundreds of thousands of geniuses went in, but only a few hundred came out in the end. The most terrifying thing is that none of these people are willing to talk about the incident. It seems that something terrible had happened. I know Farmer. He gives me the feeling that he’s a different person.”

The old man sighed softly.

“If you enter the land of the fourth mark in the Heavenly Sin, I suggest you follow Lord Alester closely. This is your best chance of survival.’

“Who is Alester? Can you tell me?”

Qin Yu was a little curious.

Cang Yunzi had a lukewarm attitude towards everyone, but he was in awe of

Alester.

Even when he swore on the Book of Wishes, he skipped Alester. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“The lord doesn’t like people talking about her behind her back. This Saint

Kingdom is too small for her.”

Cang Yunzi shook his head.

Qin Yu clicked his tongue when he heard this. What was the background of this cold and aloof woman?

“Right, Daoist Priest Cang Yunzi, I have a question.”

“Just say it.”

“My friend’s divine soul appeared when Heavenly Sin hunted me down. What exactly is going on?”

Qin Yu was still a little uneasy about what had happened before.

“I’ve also studied your question a long time ago. I suspect that’s the power of a divine artifact that can directly absorb a certain range of divine souls. This kind of heaven-defying power makes people even more powerless. I’ve investigated before. The divine souls of the people who have been saved have been blank for some time. It seems that the memories of that period have been forcefully erased. ”

“What is it? Forcibly summoning divine thought? Wouldn’t this power be able to kill people at will?”

Qin Yu was greatly shocked.

“Perhaps it has to follow some rules. Heavenly Sin only has one goal every time it appears, which is to kill the purest bloodline. Its will is to kill all the bloodlines of the traitors or control them to become atonement.”

“In other words, it killed the others as it went past. His target is only one person. That person also attracted his appearance. You’re not talking about me, are you?”

Qin Yu felt a chill run down his spine.

Cang Yunzi shook his head.

“If it were you, how would I dare to take you in? I don’t have such an ability.”

Cang Yunzi shook his head.

“Alright, that’s all I have to say. We’ll set off here in three days.”

Qin Yu nodded and directly returned to his place.

Three days. Qin Yu clenched his fists slightly.

This trip to the Tomb of Heavenly Sins was probably a perilous adventure.

According to the Daoist priest, he had to enter the tomb if he wanted to break the curse mark on his body.

What Qin Yu was hesitating about now was whether he should enter the fourth level of Heavenly Sin or not.

Forget it, things would work out when it comes to it. He’ll observe it in detail when the time comes.

Qin Yu gripped the Soul Suppression Ring with his thumb and entered the passageway again.

Looking at the dense starlight on both sides, Qin Yu no longer hesitated. He chose a slightly dim starlight.

Then, he entered the dream again. This time, he entered an even weaker living being.

He wanted to take advantage of these three days to improve himself to the maximum.

Entering the dream realm would help him to cultivate the Night Qi. Even if it was a few years of reincarnation, it would only be an instant in the Soul Suppressing Passage.

Previously when he was in the body of a lizard, the three years in the passageway had only lasted for an instant in reality.

Therefore, he could only cultivate the Dao of Dreams again in this short period.

This seemed to be a short lightning mink. Qin Yu was acting as a guest here.

He had become this lightning mink for the past two years.

Even for the lowest level of living beings, the small things it had experienced were as many as the hairs on an ox.

It was a life-threatening challenge to a low-level creature even when every time it hunted, ate, and even slept.

Qin Yu had unknowingly entered its role.

Suddenly, it felt a sharp pain and its eyes turned red.

In the next moment, its body was lifted and its neck hung weakly on the ground.

A vortex attacked. Qin Yu’s body returned to the passageway again.

His eyes were bloodshot. He was also almost on the verge of death.

The impact on his divine soul was also very huge. Qin Yu’s chest heaved up and down violently.

After sitting cross-legged for half a day only his internal qi gradually stabilized.

At this moment, the Night Qi had increased a little.

Moreover, what surprised Qin Yu was that the power of his divine soul had also strengthened once again.

His divine soul had been tempered once again. At this moment, Qin Yu’s divine sense could even clearly sense the place from afar.

This kind of improvement extremely surprised him. However, another two years had passed in the blink of an eye.

This kind of cultivation made him tremble in fear. This was two years without any reduction.

He could even recall every bit of what he had experienced in the past two years.

“The power of the Dao of Dreams is indeed mysterious. However, I can only rely on myself to figure it out.”

Moreover, he felt a little strange. He did not know if this represented reality or a dream.

From what he had experienced, it seemed to be real.

However, how could he enter someone else’s divine soul in the passageway?

Qin Yu did not understand this point. He vaguely sensed that this might be the biggest secret of the Dao of Dreams.

The most powerful person he had ever seen with such power was Jun Yixian.

However, he had already died in the ghost realm to help Qin Yu resist

Ksitigarbha. He could only rely on himself to figure out everything now..
