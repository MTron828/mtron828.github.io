The reporter’s words had obviously been prepared.

Old Mister Yan could naturally tell. He subconsciously glanced at Han Meng, who was not far away.

At this moment, Han Meng happened to be staring at Old Mister Yan while waiting for Old Mister Yan’s reply.

When their eyes met, Han Meng’s expression instantly changed slightly.

Old Mister Yan’s pupils shone with a terrifying brilliance.

This made Han Meng sweat profusely!

He quickly turned his head to the side to avoid Old Mister Yan’s gaze.

Almost everyone was filled with interest towards this question.

For a moment, countless gazes fell on Old Mister Yan while they were waiting for his answer.

Even Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel nervous.

Old Mister Yan looked at the camera and said indifferently, “I just happen to want to introduce someone to everyone.”

After saying that, Old Mister Yan looked at Qin Yu, and the camera also turned to Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu is indeed one of my son-in-law candidates,” Old Mister Yan said indifferently.

When he said that, everyone was shocked!

Updates by

Everyone couldn’t help but gasp!

Old Mister Yan... actually admitted it?

Qin Yu was really the son-in-law of the Yan family?

Han Wei’s expression turned extremely ugly!

Even though he tried his best to suppress the anger inside, an angry expression still appeared on his face!

“As for Han Wei, he is also a pretty good young man. I also think highly of him,” Old Mister Yan changed the topic and said with a smile.

His ambiguous answer made people somewhat confused.

“Old Mister Yan, between the two of them, who will you choose?” The host asked relentlessly. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Old Mister Yan took a sip of water and said indifferently, “I am an open-minded person. I will listen to my granddaughter.”

Oh no!

Hearing Old Mister Yan’s words, almost everyone in the Han family had a sudden change in expression!

Who didn’t know that Yan Ruoxue was interested in Qin Yu?

Wasn’t Old Mister Yan basically choosing Qin Yu?

Qin Yu, who was at the side, let out a slight sigh of relief.

His face couldn’t help but reveal a grateful expression.

“Miss Yan, then you...”

“Enough questions.” The reporter wanted to continue asking, but was interrupted by Old Mister Yan.

The reporter was slightly embarrassed and could only smile sheepishly, “Then I won’t bother you anymore. Happy birthday again.”

After saying this, the reporter left in a hurry.

Han Meng took a deep breath.

He never expected that Old Mister Yan would snub the Han family in public!

“This old fart...” Han Meng clenched his fists, and a strong murderous aura burst out of his eyes.

But soon, Han Meng let go of his hand again.

He knew very well that no one dared to have the intention to kill Old Mister Yan.

The Sun family was an example back then.

At this moment, Yan Sihai walked over from not far away.

Seeing Yan Sihai, Han Meng seemed to have seen a life-saving straw.

He hurriedly pulled Yan Sihai and said, “Mr. Yan, Old Mister Yan seems to value Qin Yu very much.”

Yan Sihai didn’t take it seriously. He sneered and said, “So? Didn’t my father leave a chance for your son?”

“Is this considered a chance?” Han Meng couldn’t help but ask.

Yan Sihai snorted and said, “If he didn’t leave a chance for you, the fate of the Han family won’t be much different from the Sun family’s back then.”

Han Meng’s body suddenly tensed up, and a chill ran down his back.

...

Along with the deafening sound in the manor, the birthday banquet officially began.

Everyone raised their glasses and drank together. From time to time, people would come to toast.

The atmosphere was harmonious and merry.

Qin Yu’s expression didn’t look too good.

He looked at Old Mister Yan from time to time, and his eyes were filled with worry.

Because... the aura of death between Old Mister Yan’s brows had expanded a little.

His vital point had been completely covered by this black energy. It was the signal that his life was ending.

Qin Yu noticed the change in Old Mister Yan’s expression.

He looked calm, but in fact, he was toughing it out.

“Cough Cough.” At this moment, Old Mister Yan suddenly coughed.

His complexion instantly paled.

Qin Yu hurriedly placed his hand on Old Mister Yan’s shoulder and injected waves of spiritual energy into his body.

After feeling this warmth, Old Mister Yan patted the back of Qin Yu’s hand to indicate that he was fine.

The banquet was held until three o’clock in the afternoon, and it was finally coming to an end.

The guests began to leave one after another.

Old Mister Yan seemed to be unable to hold on any longer. He looked at Yan Sihai and Yan Ruoxue, then said, “Help me send off the guests. I’m going to rest first.”

“Old Mister Yan, let me accompany you,” Qin Yu took the initiative to say.

Old Mister Yan glanced at Qin Yu and nodded. “Alright.”

Therefore, Qin Yu used some strength to gently support Old Mister Yan.

Then, the two of them walked straight into the villa.

After entering the villa, Old Mister Yan waved his hand, indicating for Qin Yu to close the door.

The moment the door closed, Old Mister Yan couldn’t hold on any longer.

He collapsed to the ground with a bang.

“Old Mister Yan!” Qin Yu’s expression changed. He hurriedly supported Old Mister Yan and said anxiously, “Are you alright?”

Old Mister Yan waved his hand with difficulty and said with almost all his strength, “I... I’m afraid I can’t hold on... Qin Yu, you have to take good care of Ruoxue in the future. The one I can’t rest assured about the most is her...”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He spread out his palm and covered the space between Old Mister Yan’s brows to forcefully extend Old Mister Yan’s life.

Unfortunately, Qin Yu’s medical skills were ineffective at that moment. No matter how hard Qin Yu tried his best, there was no effect at all.

Old Mister Yan’s internal qi was getting weaker and weaker. At this rate, Old Mister Yan probably wouldn’t live for more than three days.

Qin Yu helped Old Mister Yan to the bed. He sat at the side and anxiously searched for the life-prolonging plan left behind in the inheritance.

At this moment, the door opened.

Then, Yan Sihai and the others walked in with large strides.

When he saw Old Mister Yan lying on the bed, Yan Sihai narrowed his eyes and shouted, “Qin Yu, what have you done to my father?!”

Qin Yu was stunned. He hurriedly explained, “No, Old Mister Yan’s health is failing. I’m trying to think of a way to save him...”

“Nonsense!” Yan Sihai snorted.

“My father was fine just now. Why did he suddenly collapse?”

“I think you’re the one who wants to harm my father! You despicable and shameless person!”

As soon as these words were said, Qin Yu immediately understood.

Yan Sihai was trying to frame him.

“Grandfather!” When Yan Ruoxue saw this scene, she hurriedly rushed to Old Mister Yan’s side.

“Grandfather, you... What’s wrong with you?” Yan Ruoxue’s tone was anxious, and there was some fear in her voice. For a moment, she seemed to be at a loss of what to do.

Beside her, Yan Sihai said coldly, “Ruoxue, this is the man you like? A person with ulterior motives?!”
