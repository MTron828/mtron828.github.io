Chapter 716: The Power of the Heaven Swallowing Python!! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“What did you say?” Yan Jinyao frowned slightly, and his expression quickly turned cold.

“I told you to get lost. If you don’t want to die, then scram a little further,” Blackie continued.

As soon as he said this, Yan Jinyao immediately became furious.

He looked at Blackie coldly and said with a nonchalant smile, “Why? I’ve been in closed-door cultivation for a few days, and there’s already someone who doesn’t know me?”

Blackie didn’t know Yan Jinyao at all, not to mention Yan Jinyao’s words, which made him quite unhappy.

Qin Yu, who was watching the two of them argue, was happy to see it.

“It’s really dog-eat-dog,” Chang Mang snorted at the side.

Blackie didn’t pay attention to Yan Jinyao anymore. A black light burst out from his body, and his internal qi was also unleashed at this moment.

An extremely strange internal qi surrounded his body. This feeling made people feel numb all over and fear from the bottom of their hearts.

Even Yan Jinyao couldn’t help but frown.

“Qin Yu, die,” Blackie said coldly.

Before he finished speaking, he clenched his fist and rushed toward Qin Yu.

His fist was brewing with powerful force.

It was a force that could topple mountains and overturn seas.

Qin Yu’s expression didn’t change. With a loud shout, he raised his golden fist.

In the next second, the two incomparably fierce fists collided.

“Boom!”

The collision brought about waves of terrifying collision force. This force exploded between the two of them and then spread out in all directions!

Some who couldn’t dodge in time were directly shaken until they vomited blood.

A large locust tree beside the two of them was directly shaken into powder!

Dust fell, and the two of them stood on the spot without moving an inch.

The collision of the two rays of light appeared especially dazzling under the sunlight.

“Not bad.” After a while, Blackie spat out a word.

Qin Yu remained silent, but he was deeply shocked!

The physical body of this Heaven Swallowing Python was indeed extremely powerful!

With Qin Yu’s current physical body, he was no weaker than anyone below the Martial Saint level!

However, against the Heaven Swallowing Python, Qin Yu couldn’t win at all!

“If I was in the same realm as him, I would have the confidence to win. However, the gap between our realms is too big.” Qin Yu frowned.

The advantage in terms of his physique seemed to have disappeared in front of demonic beasts.

And Blackie was a genuine peak-stage Martial Marquis! He was three realms higher than Qin Yu was!

If they were to really fight, Qin Yu had no chance of winning!

Everyone held their breaths as their eyes fell on the small battlefield. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Yan Jinyao’s brows furrowed.

He could feel the power of Blackie’s punch! Moreover, he could clearly feel that this wasn’t his full strength at all!

“When did such a powerhouse appear?” Yan Jinyao said coldly.

“Brother Yan, you might not know this, but Blackie is Granny Qin’s disciple. It is said that he is basically like her son,” Zhuang Teng said as he walked forward.

“Granny Qin?” Yan Jinyao seemed to have understood.

Granny Qin’s status in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association was very high. It was even higher than Qu Xie’s.

As for her strength, it was even more unfathomable.

Since he was one of her people, it was easy to understand.

Yan Jinyao retreated to the side, seemingly not planning to attack Blackie anymore.

At this moment, Blackie’s internal qi was still climbing.

An invisible pressure was pressing toward Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s shoulders seemed to be carrying two mountains, and his body emitted crackling sounds.

“Your realm is too low. I can kill you with just a raise of my hand,” Blackie said coldly.

“Is that so?” Qin Yu took a deep breath, and the internal qi on his body suddenly exploded!

When the two internal qi collided, Blackie was obviously stronger. Qin Yu’s internal qi seemed to be unable to resist.

Just as swords were about to be drawn, a man wearing a brocade robe walked over.

“Fighting isn’t allowed in the academy.” This person was none other than Xia Hang.

Xia Hang stood between the two of them and said coldly, “Both of you, stop.”

Blackie frowned and seemed to be a little unhappy.

However, due to Xia Hang’s identity, Blackie finally withdrew the murderous internal qi from his body.

“President Xia, there’s nothing wrong with interacting and communicating among people of the same generation.” Right at this moment, Granny Qin suddenly walked out.

She took an old step, and her face, which was full of wrinkles, had a smile.

“Granny Qin.” Xia Hang hurriedly greeted Granny Qin.

Granny Qin smiled nonchalantly and said, “The younger generation should interact more. Otherwise, how can they improve?”

With Granny Qin as a backer, Blackie was instantly relieved.

His long hair fluttered in the wind, and his internal qi at the peak of the Martial Marquis realm was even more obvious!

“Peak of the Martial Marquis Realm!” After he sensed this internal qi, Yan Jinyao’s pupils suddenly constricted! His expression instantly became extremely unsightly!

“He’s really at the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm!” Kong Yun also stood out and shouted loudly!

He recalled what Qin Yu said, but he didn’t believe it at that time.

Now that he thought about it, he really felt a sense of lingering fear!

If Blackie really accepted his challenge, then Daming Mountain would probably become his burial ground!

“Granny Qin, today is the first day of school, so it’s not suitable to fight.” Xia Hang continued to smooth things over.

Granny Qin was silent for a moment, as if she felt that Xia Hang’s words made sense.

She said with a smile, “Blackie, have you remembered President Xia’s words?”

“Granny Qin, I’ve remembered it.” Blackie nodded and looked at Qin Yu at the same time.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

Granny Qin’s meaning was very obvious. She was telling Blackie that he could make a move at any time after a few days.

Blackie left with Granny Qin while Qin Yu stood where he was.

“Qin Yu, who told you to stir up trouble?” Xia Hang shouted.

Qin Yu glanced at Xia Hang and snorted. “He came to provoke me. Are you blind?”

“You still dare to argue? Follow me to the office!” Xia Hang said angrily.

“You motherf *cker...” Chang Mang, who was at the side, suddenly became anxious and opened his mouth to scold.

Qin Yu hurriedly stopped Chang Mang and waved his hand. “I’m fine.”

After saying that, Qin Yu followed behind Xia Hang and walked into the office.

After arriving at the office, Xia Hang locked the door.

At the same time, he released his spiritual sense to ensure that there was no one around.

“Qin Yu, you’d better leave this place quickly,” Xia Hang said coldly.

“Blackie is the incarnation of the Heaven Swallowing Python. His strength is unfathomable. You definitely aren’t his match!”

“Other than the Heaven Swallowing Python, Yan Jinyao, Ao Zhan, and even Han Xiu mightl attack you at any time!”

Qin Yu said jokingly, “Aren’t you the president? You can protect me.”

Xia Hang said with a cold look, “I’ll protect you? Don’t you know that Granny Qin is in charge here?”

Qin Yu was puzzled. “Why? She doesn’t seem to have any official position, right?”

Xia Hang said in a deep voice, “She doesn’t need an official position. She has mobilization authority of the purple-robed men, as well as many honored guests of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”
