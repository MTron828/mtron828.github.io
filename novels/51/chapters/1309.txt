Chapter 1310: Chapter 1,310, Babe’s grandson

“I wonder if anyone saw it,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

If they were discovered, they would probably get into trouble.

However, since the item was already in his hands, there was no reason for him to hand it over. Even if he was discovered, the worst that could happen was that he wouldn’t admit it even if he was beaten to death.

After a hearty meal, the three of them drank again.

Perhaps it was because they were happy to have found the Huangji Buddha Flame, but Qin Yu drank even more.

When he woke up, it was already noon the next day.

At this time, the battle for the Huangji Buddha Flame had already ended. Almost the entire southern province was discussing this matter.

Qin Yu and the Wen brothers were sitting in the restaurant of the Ju Xian restaurant. They heard the people around them discussing in low voices.

“Did you hear? Eight mighty figures died in the battle yesterday!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Yeah, quite a few people went there to pick up a lot of Babe.”

“Rumor has it that they were there for the Huangji Buddha Flame, but the F * ck is that they couldn’t find it at all. Some people suspect that someone took the opportunity to steal it.”

“TSK tsk, that kid who was able to steal the Huangji Buddha Flame is really lucky.”

Hearing the discussions of the crowd, Qin Yu could not help but think that things were not looking good.

Since there were people who suspected, then they would definitely look for traces of Huangji Foyan.

The first to bear the brunt would definitely be the people who participated in the auction that day.

“I hope they don’t suspect us,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

As the saying goes, the more afraid one was, the easier it was for something to happen.

At noon that day, while the three of them were having lunch, a group of people walked over.

The leader was a man wearing a night suit, with two people following behind him.

They walked straight to Qin Yu’s table and sat down.

“What? who the F * ck told you to sit here?”Wen Da suddenly widened his eyes.

The three people glanced at Wen Da and then said coldly, “The three of you attended the auction yesterday, Right?”

“What does it have to do with you? Hurry up and get lost. Don’t make me lose my temper,”Wen da said with some anger.

“That’s right, that’s right. Don’t look for trouble yourself,”Wen er also shouted.

The three men completely ignored the Wen brothers’warning. He coldly said, “Huang Ji Fo Yan has been lost. We were ordered to search. Please cooperate with us.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s expression slightly changed.

“He came to us so quickly...”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

Huang Ji Fo Yan was still on Qin Yu’s body. He didn’t even have the time to hide it.

“Why the F * ck do I have to cooperate?”Wen Da slammed the table and angrily said.

“Don’t Be Shameless,”the other party said coldly.

“Aiyo F * ck, who are you talking to? Are you courting death?”Wen da rolled up his sleeves and said.

“Yes, yes.”Wen Er followed closely behind.

Qin Yu saw that the situation was not good and slowly stood up, ready to make a move at any time.

“Search!”The other party shouted and the two people beside him immediately walked towards Qin Yu.

“Stop!”

But at this moment, the big-bellied general from before suddenly rushed over.

He led a large group of people and rushed upstairs.

The boy wearing night clothes couldn’t help but frown and said, “This matter involves a lot of people. I hope your gu city doesn’t meddle in other people’s business.”

The big-bellied general shook his stomach and said, “If it were anyone else, I naturally wouldn’t meddle. But these two people are senior Wen Wanyan’s grandchildren.”

At the mention of Wen Wanyan, the man wearing night clothes immediately frowned.

He had heard of Wen Wanye’s two grandsons. They were famous prodigals who did not care about natural treasures at all. They would definitely not take a fancy to their Huangji Buddha Flame.

“Good. Since they are senior Wen’s grandsons, I believe in You,”said ye Xingyi.

“That’s more like it,”muttered Wen Da.

“But he can’t be, right?”But at this time, ye Xingyi suddenly changed the topic and looked coldly at Qin Yu.

Big Wen slapped the table again and stood up. He berated, “What do you mean? Qin Yu is my friend. Don’t be so Shameless!”

“That’s right, that’s right. Do you believe that you can ask my grandfather to beat you up?”Wen Er followed closely behind.

A hint of conflict flashed between ye Xingyi’s brows.

Then, he looked coldly at Big Wen and said, “Even if you are senior Wen’s grandson, I believe that he won’t stop us from searching.”

“Moreover, although senior Wen is strong, he may not be able to find us.”

Wen Da’s expression slightly changed as he stared at him and said, “What do you mean?”

“Nothing much. I hope that the two of you will not meddle in other people’s business. Otherwise... Don’t blame me for being impolite!”said the night clothes coldly.

The atmosphere instantly became extremely tense. Qin Yu was also secretly mobilizing his divine power, preparing to escape at any time.

At this time, the big-bellied general said, “If it were any other time, your words would definitely be fine, but I’m afraid it won’t be possible today.”

Ye Xingyi glanced at the big-bellied general and coldly said, “What do you mean?”

The big-bellied general chuckled and said, “You may not know this, but Senior Wen is currently looking for his two precious grandchildren. They have already descended on Gu City.”

“If you touch them, do you think you can still walk out of Gu City?”
