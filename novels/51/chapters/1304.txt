Chapter 1305: Chapter 1,305, Wen Da’s thoughts 

‘this is the only solution.’the city Lord Sighed in his heart.

The top-notch martial artist of Gu City set off at the same time, secretly watching the three of them. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

As for Qin Yu, he was led by the Wen brothers all the way to the most famous auction in Gu City.

As the top auction in Gu City, it was naturally extremely luxurious and grand.

Just as he arrived at the entrance, Qin Yu saw many flying exotic beasts stopping by the side.

There were countless experts hiding in the dark. Although Qin Yu couldn’t see their cultivation realms, the pressure emitted by the experts was extremely clear.

The three of them went to check their qualifications. After receiving their number plates, they walked into the auction.

The two Wen Brothers, who loved to show off, naturally wouldn’t choose a seat at the back. They pulled Qin Yu along and rushed all the way to the first row to sit down.

“Mm, this seat is still the most comfortable.”Wen Da lay on the huge demon beast fur and said with a relaxed expression.

“It would be even more comfortable if there were two girls accompanying me.”Wen Er said with narrowed eyes.

He used his arm to Poke Wen da and said anxiously, “Quick, look, how is that girl?”

With a glance, he saw a curvy woman slowly walking over.

“TSK TSK, not bad at all.”Wen Da swallowed his saliva.

“That seems to be the auctioneer here,”Wen er muttered.

“Not bad, not bad at all. I have to take care of her business later!”Wen Da’s eyes were wide open, and he almost drooled.

Qin Yu was not as leisurely and elegant as them.

Gu city was a place full of hidden dragons and Crouching Tigers. Because it was very close to the top-notch martial artist’s organization, there were often experts who came to travel and search for treasures.

Those who could sit at the front row had extraordinary backgrounds.

Qin Yu looked at the people around him and found that everyone around him was dressed luxuriously. Some of them even wore strange symbols, which seemed to be the symbols of the sect.

It’s better to keep a low profile, Qin Yu thought to himself.

More and more people were present. In a short while, the entire auction was full.

“Buzz...”

At this moment, a few rays of light flashed out from a few corners of the auction house.

Spiritual artifacts could be seen hanging in a few areas of the auction house.

The spiritual artifacts emitted an extremely terrifying internal Qi. An extremely oppressive atmosphere enveloped the entire auction house.

The female auctioneer slowly walked onto the stage. She wore a black qipao and a light makeup on her face. Under the light of the light, she looked extremely beautiful.

“TSK tsk, she’s really beautiful.”Wen Da licked his lips.

Wen Er even whistled at the auctioneer.

The auctioneer glanced at Wen er and frowned slightly, as if she was a little unhappy.

The rest of the people also looked at Wen er, their eyes filled with surprise.

“Who is that person? How dare he be so rude.”

“Shh, those are the two idiots that the Wen family is famous for. Don’t offend them easily.”

“Wen Wanye’s grandson. Wen wanye actually has two useless grandsons.”

The surrounding comments didn’t seem to have any lethality to the Wen brothers.

Not only did they not feel ashamed, they were even a little proud.

Even Qin Yu was a little speechless. He whispered, “Brother Wen, aren’t you angry that they said that about you?”

Wen Da waved his hand and said, “They are just jealous, do you know that?”

“That’s right, that’s right. They are jealous of us. Why should we be angry? They should be the ones who should be angry.”Wen Er also nodded and said.

Qin Yu scratched his head and said, “Although I don’t know your grandfather, from their words, senior Wen wanye should be a top-notch martial artist. His bloodline flows in your body. Presumably, your talent is not bad, but what is your realm...”

“Wow, you don’t understand, do you?”Wen Da waved his hand and said.

“Why do you cultivate so hard? We came to this world to enjoy life.”

“Exactly, exactly.”Wen Er also hurriedly nodded.

Qin Yu scratched his head and said, “But the higher the realm, the longer your life will be. Don’t you want to live a few more years?”

“TSK, Brother Qin, your awareness needs to be improved. What is the point of living so many years? It’s enough to live a wonderful life,”Wen da said cheerfully.

Qin Yu opened his mouth, but for a moment, he had nothing to retort.

It had to be said that these two brothers really lived thoroughly.

As they were speaking, the female auctioneer knocked on the hammer.

She swept her gaze across the crowd, and a brilliant smile bloomed on her face.

“Welcome to the GU city auction, everyone,”the auctioneer said with a faint smile.

“This time, our auction has meticulously prepared treasures for everyone, including many uncommon heavenly and earthly treasures, including the marrow cleansing fire, Tianzhi, Huangji Buddha Flame, and many other top-tier magic artifacts. I believe that we will not disappoint everyone.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. She didn’t know much about these treasures, but since they were taken out by themselves, they must be extraordinary.

He knocked his eyes on everyone and found that their faces were calm, and he couldn’t see anything.

“Brother Wen, how much is the marrow cleansing fire that the auctioneer mentioned?”Qin Yu asked tentatively.

Big Wen counted with his fingers and said, “It won’t be less than one million spirit coins.”

“That’s right. As for the price of the mushroom that day, it will be even more expensive. Rumor has it that the stalk that my grandfather fought for back then was worth three million spirit coins.”

Hearing the words of the two brothers, Qin Yu had a rough idea of the price.

“This ten million... should be enough,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He didn’t care about other treasures. What he needed the most right now was life qi.

“Don’t you want life qi? Don’t be anxious. If you don’t have it, I’ll ask the auctioneer in private,”said Wen da lecherously.
