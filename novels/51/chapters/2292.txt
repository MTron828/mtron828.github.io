2293 Killing the White Ape

“Turbulent times are approaching, and no one can stay out of it. Every Great Dao had killing intent. Primordial Heavenly Divination could only help you make one choice.”

“I have deduced that whether I can break through the restraints of the Path of Heaven this time or not depends on Qin Yu.”

“Yes, Master.”

Nangong Qi also revealed a sinister smile. No matter who died, as long as he clung tightly to Hua Tian’s thigh, it would be fine.

…

Qin Yu strolled around the central square of Solitary Cloud City to see if there were any cultivators to go to the eighth level of purgatory.

However, he did not find any powerful cultivators. After going one round, Qin Yu could only give up.

If they were not powerful, they would only burden him.

“Hmph!”

A cold snort sounded. Qin Yu felt a familiar internal qi.

He turned around and saw Xing Mou looking at him coldly.

“F*ck! Don’t let me see you outside Solitary Cloud City. I’ll mess you up each time I see you.”

Qin Yu pointed at him and cursed.

This guy had tricked him more than once. He was not afraid of him even when Wu Feng was around, not to mention it was without the strongest Wu Feng.

“You won’t be energetic for long. Don’t get too proud.”

Xing Mou said fiercely and turned to leave.

“Qin Yu, be careful. You have the masked woman’s coffin and Suo Lin’s divine artifact. Many people are coveting you. Try not to be too high-profile.”

Ji Yue was also there. She voice-transmitted Qin Yu.

“I know what to do, thank you.”

Qin Yu nodded. These people were like clowns in his eyes.

After leaving Wang Feng and Yun Qingyun on the third level, he began to rush to the eighth level of purgatory.

Their bodies were wrapped in a layer of green internal qi, and the internal qi on their bodies was concealed to the extreme.

“Qin Yu has left Solitary Cloud City. His intention should be going deeper into purgatory, probably the seventh level.”

Someone crushed the communication jade jade.

Soon, Qin Yu arrived at the seventh level of purgatory.

Qin Yu put away the warship and rushed toward the entrance to the eighth level.

Many ferocious demonic beasts were lurking in the mist here. Although he was not afraid, the warship could not stop the attacks of these demonic beasts.

“Whoosh!”

A gust of strong wind came from behind Qin Yu, and a white ape suddenly appeared amidst the eerie demonic qi.

The white ape swung a staff toward Qin Yu with great force. Qin Yu raised his head to block and grabbed it directly

Qin Yu’s body suddenly sank, and the great force slammed both his feet onto the ground.

In an instant, the ground shattered.

Qin Yu was a little surprised. His palm was slightly numb.

Although this white ape’s strength was at the eighth grade, it was full of brutal and destructive internal qi.

The terrifying force of the staff might even be beyond the reach of some ninth-grade cultivators.

Qin Yu’s body lit up with golden light, activating his Saintly Body Technique.

An infiltrating pressure suddenly fell on the white ape’s body, and it keenly sensed the danger.

It stepped back in bewilderment as if it could not understand why the person before its eyes, who was not very powerful, would cause it to have such a strange feeling.

“You may go. I don’t want to kill you.”

Qin Yu said softly.

He only wanted to go to the eighth level of purgatory and did not want to waste time.

After saying that, Qin Yu turned around and left.

“Who are you looking down on?”

The white ape seemed to have been angered by Qin Yu’s indifferent attitude. It let out an awkward voice.

The enormous staff expanded a hundred times in the air and smashed toward Qin Yu like a mountain.

Qin Yu bent his fist to gather power, and golden light bloomed on his fist like the sun.

He threw a punch directly at the Vajra Staff, and a golden internal qi circulated on the staff.

A surging immense force transmitted to the white ape’s body through the Vajra Staff, and a golden radiance spread across the white ape’s tough white skin.

In an instant, a golden net formed on its body, and then a terrifying force directly exploded.

The white ape’s fur shattered, and numerous wounds instantly appeared on its body.

The gap was too significant. With all its strength, the white ape’s attack could barely reach the ninth grade, but Qin Yu’s attack had already exceeded this level after using the Sacred Body Technique.

“Roar!”

The white ape’s eyes suddenly turned red, and the aura on its body rose at a terrifying rate.

“Berserk?”

Qin Yu frowned. No wonder no one could deal with this white ape despite it being in the seventh level of purgatory for so long.

It turned out that it had such a trump card. After going berserk, the white ape’s strength entered the realm of ninth grade.

Coupled with the divine power on his terrifying body, even the sect master of the Blood Sect, Gu Ming, would be afraid of him.

“Roar!”

The giant ape grabbed the Varja Staff and kicked toward Qin Yu.

The giant staff made a sharp sound and flew toward Qin Yu like a flying sword.

He suddenly grabbed the giant staff. Seeing the white ape already lose its divine sense, Qin Yu did not waste his time.

He formed the fighting word formula, and his body’s aura soared again.

After that, his body leaped up like a cannonball and arrived before the giant ape.

He then punched out.

The giant ape refused to be outdone, either.

“Boom!” A colossal force transmitted to the surroundings, and the ground instantly shook.

The water in the nearby Bone Cultivation River exploded into the air like a fountain. Some cultivators who were cultivating in the cultivation water woke up immediately.

The gap in their strength was determined in that instant.

Qin Yu’s arm pierced through the white ape’s arm and head.

“You’re courting death!”

Qin Yu dug out the inner core of the white ape and put the iron staff into the Sumeru ring. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

This weapon had clashed with him several times, but there were no signs of cracks on its surface. It should be a weapon of good quality.

“It’s a pity. It should be considered a top-grade material if it doesn’t have any damage.”

Qin Yu shook his head.

“Qin Yu, why are you here?”

A soft voice sounded. It was Mei Li, who was dressed in red.

“I’m sorry. Did I disturb your cultivation? The commotion is a little too big.”

Qin Yu said with a smile.

Although he had fought with this woman before, there was no deep-seated grudge between them.

“This white ape’s defense is very impressive and was also born with divine power. I didn’t expect you to kill it so easily. Your strength has increased significantly again.”

There was a surprise in Mei Li’s beautiful eyes.

“I really can’t imagine what level your strength will reach once you break through to fifth grade.”

“I’m here this time for this matter as well. I’m prepared to go to the eighth level of Mystic Realm to see if I can break through.”

Qin Yu said with a bitter smile. He had been unable to break through this cultivation realm for a long time and was now beginning to feel tremendous pressure.

“The eighth level of purgatory is not a bad choice if you want to comprehend the Path of Heaven. Purgatory has the strongest Path of Heaven in this galaxy, but the eighth level is divided into areas,” Mei Li reminded.
