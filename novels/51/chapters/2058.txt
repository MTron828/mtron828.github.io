2059 The Confidence of the True Saint

Qin Yu was incredibly shocked. He did not expect this grand event to attract the appearance of a True Saint!

The True Saint’s cultivation realm was the highest level in the immortal path cultivation, and its power was unparalleled and almost invincible! Qin Yu had never seen a True Saint!

Holy Lord Si’s expression was calm. Obviously, he had expected a True Saint to descend.

The True Saint slowly appeared wearing a white robe, and numerous stars seemed to be shining at his back.

He looked around with a calm expression, and every move he made seemed to display a dao technique.

!!

Everyone looked at the True Saint with reverence, and some even knelt on the spot. Nobody knew if it was due to the formidable pressure on him or the fear in their hearts.

“It’s him?”

Someone identified the True Saint at this moment.

“It’s Xuan Jizi.” An elderly man from the Gu family stepped forward and bowed slightly.

“Xuan Jizi? The Star Daoist?”

“That’s right. It’s him! He is famous in the cultivation world for his discerning eyes and ability to see through everything in the world!”

“Rumor has it that he stepped into the starry sky through Astral Mountain back then and created countless legends on his path, becoming a role model for countless cultivators! I didn’t expect him to still be alive!”

Xuan Jizi’s expression was calm. He glanced at everyone and said indifferently, “I didn’t want to interfere in the matter of the Chaos Grave. I just heard that this place was lively and couldn’t help but come to take a look. As for the supreme bone, I do have some understanding of it.”

The scene instantly fell silent. Countless people held their breaths, afraid that they would miss any details.

Holy Lord Si frowned, stood up, and said, “Is what you said true?” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“I met a cultivator not long ago,” Xuan Jizi continued. “He had a supreme bone in his hand but didn’t know what it was. He only learned the truth after my guidance. However, he had no interest in the Chaos Grave but only wanted to use the supreme bone to make a magical artifact.”

Qin Yu was shocked. Was he the cultivator this True Saint was talking about? However, he had never seen this True Saint before.

“This Xuan Jizi is probably talking nonsense.” Qin Yu frowned.

All the supreme bones in the world were in his hands. How could this Xuan Jizi have the supreme bone?

Holy Lord Si looked at Xuan Jizi with a solemn expression and asked again, “Is this true?”

“Why would I come here to lie?” Xuan Jizi smiled faintly and said. “I don’t care about the supreme bone, and I have no fortuity in the Chaos Grave. Why don’t I use this supreme bone to exchange for something?”

Holy Lord Si was silent for a moment but then nodded. “If you really have the supreme bone, my Si family is willing to make a good offer to exchange for it.”

Although True Saints were rare nowadays, it did not mean the nine great aristocratic families could not deal with them.

“What if I say I want the aristocratic families to exchange for it with their respective immortal scriptures?” Xuan Jizi smiled faintly and said.

Hearing this, the expressions of the people from the various aristocratic families immediately turned ugly.

“Senior Xuan Jizi, you should know what the immortal scriptures of each family mean. They are never taught to outsiders. Even their own disciples may not be qualified to cultivate them,” the representative of the Yan family took the lead to speak

“That’s right. The supreme bone is tempting enough but the immortal scripture is definitely not for anyone,” the Gu family also said.

“Are you here to make fun of us? You should know what the immortal scriptures of each family mean,” The Yao family said coldly.

Xuan Jizi wasn’t angry. He put his hands behind his back and said, “There is no need for everyone to be angry. In any case, it is up to you to decide if you want to exchange it. However… I must remind you there’s no more such an opportunity if you miss it.”

Qin Yu was surprised. He couldn’t help but feel doubtful about Xuan Jizi’s background and purpose.

The True Saints were too powerful. They could probably kill an ordinary cultivator with a casual breath!

What was even more terrifying was that the True Saints had already comprehended the dao technique. Their perception of the Great Dao of heaven and earth was not something ordinary cultivators could compare to.

At this moment, Qin Yu was slightly worried. He rubbed his chin and said in a low voice, “Could it be that he has sensed something from me…”

“The Si family is willing to exchange for the supreme bone in your hand with a tribulation magical artifact,” Holy Lord Si said at this moment.

However, Xuan Jizi shook his head and said, “I don’t want a tribulation magical artifact but only the immortal scripture. Other than that, I don’t want to talk about it.”

Holy Lord Si frowned even more. He stood up and said, “Senior Xuan Jizi, the Si family’s immortal scriptures cannot be taught to outsiders. Why don’t you change your condition?”

“I’ve already made myself clear,” Xuan Jizi said calmly.

Holy Lord Si’s face turned cold. He looked at Xuan Jizi and said, “Although you are a True Saint, the Si family has ways to deal with you. Xuan Jizi, your vital energy has depreciated for many years. If the Si family is willing, we can snatch the supreme bone from you!”

The atmosphere instantly turned somewhat cold, and a killing intent overflowed the entire Astral Mountain!

Xuan Jizi looked at Holy Lord Si and suddenly raised his palm. A terrifying dao technique immediately surged out!

Even though Holy Lord Si was far away, he was forced back a few steps, and blood spurted out of his mouth!

“If I had wanted to kill you, you would have been dead by now,” Xuan Jizi said coldly.

“Since you know that my vitality energy has depreciated and I don’t have much time left, I can attack your Si family before I die! Even if I can’t get rid of your Si family, I can at least weaken your Si family! Do it if your Si family wants to give it a try!”

Everyone was shocked! This Xuan Jizi actually attacked the Holy Lord of the Si family!

Although it was only a light strike, it had tarnished the Si family’s reputation!

“As expected of a True Saint! Even when faced with a giant like the Si family, he is not afraid at all!”

“Didn’t you hear what he said? His vital energy has depreciated, and he doesn’t have much time left. At his cultivation realm, I’m afraid that his friends and family have already passed away. There’s nothing to be afraid of!”

“That’s right. He has nothing to lose. It’s not wise for the Si family to provoke a True Saint at this time.”

Just like everyone was talking about, although Holy Lord Si was furious, he still suppressed his anger.

Xuan Jizi obviously did not want to be at odds with the Si family, so he only used the slightest bit of his strength.

“If you really have the supreme bone, I can lend you the Si family’s immortal scripture, but you can only borrow it from my family,” Holy Lord Sii said coldly.

“Of course, no problem,” said Xuan Jizi after some thought. “I’ll go to your Si family three days later.”
