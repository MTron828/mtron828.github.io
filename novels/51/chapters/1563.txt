Chapter 1564: Chapter 1,564, Qin Yu’s terrifying strength! 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s gaze was fixed on the battlefield at the northern border.

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly when he saw Xiao Hai fighting bitterly.

When he saw Yong Ji and the other two, Qin Yu became even angrier!

“These three bastards...”Qin Yu’s body couldn’t help but emit a trace of killing intent!

They originally came from the southern region, but now they were encircling and annihilating Xiao Hai!

Most importantly, Xiao Hai still had to free up his hands to protect the others!

Qin Yu’s expression became even colder. He immediately patted the Divine Eagle’s head, indicating for him to speed up.

Along the way, Qin Yu’s eyes did not leave the battlefield.

He personally saw how the blood-soaked Xiao Hai resisted the three of them.

At this moment, even Qin Yu had been infected by Xiao Hai’s heroic spirit.

Protecting everyone while facing the three top-notch martial artist of the South region. This kind of mental state was not something an ordinary person could compare to.

The Godly Eagle flew high in the sky and sped toward the northern border.

At the northern border, Xiao Hai was extremely arrogant. Every palm strike of his had the power to destroy everything in its path!

......

Although Yong Ji and the other two weren’t injured, it would be extremely difficult for them to take down Xiao Hai.

“How could this bastard be so powerful?”Yong Ji was growing increasingly anxious in his heart!

Xiao Hai’s strength had completely surpassed their understanding!

They were clearly at the peak of the Almighty Realm, but why was the difference in strength so great? !

Most importantly, Xiao Hai didn’t have any fancy moves at all. He only relied on his dense spiritual power!

“Boom!”

At this moment, Xiao Hai’s palm struck over again!

Yong Ji naturally did not dare to take it head-on. He hurriedly dodged to the side, but the residual power still made him very uncomfortable.

“Let’s attack together. We must kill him!”Yong Ji looked at Feng Hai and Baro.

The two of them nodded slightly. It was very obvious that they also wanted to get rid of Xiao Hai as soon as possible.

“Three against one, and you still can’t win? Is this the South Province’s three lunatics and three absolute arts? Don’t you find it embarrassing?”

At this moment, a cold voice came from a few kilometers away!

Hearing this voice, almost everyone turned their heads to look over.

They saw a young man standing on the back of the divine eagle, coldly sweeping his gaze over the three people.

“Qin Yu? ! Why is he here...”

Seeing Qin Yu, Yong Ji’s expression became even more unsightly.

Xiao Hai could not help but be a little surprised. He fantasized about Qin Yu’s direction and shouted, “Qin Yu, why are you here!”

Qin Yu jumped down from the back of the godly eagle and immediately shot toward Xiao Hai.

He stood beside Xiao Hai and said sincerely, “Senior Xiao Hai, thank you for your hard work.”

Xiao Hai laughed loudly and said, “Just the three of them? I’m afraid it won’t be that easy to kill me!”

Qin Yu naturally believed him. He nodded to Xiao Hai and said, “Senior Xiao Hai, these three people are known as the peak of the South Province. I’ve admired their reputation for a long time. I want to see so for myself.”

Hearing this, Xiao Hai hurriedly shook his head and said, “Qin Yu, I’m very happy that you can come, but you’re not their match. If you really want to help, then protect the cultivators of the South Province.”

However, Qin Yu sneered. He coldly looked in the direction of Yongji and said, “I’ve long said that I will take Yongji’s life. Today is a good opportunity.”

Without waiting for Xiao Hai to stop him, Qin Yu shot up.

He coldly looked at Yongji and said, “You are indeed a hypocrite.”

Yongji said with a cold face, “You know nothing! I’m warning you, you’d better mind your own business!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Mind your own business? I’m not minding my own business.”Qin Yu’s internal Qi was rapidly increasing.

He stretched out a finger and pointed it at Yong Ji, shouting, “You didn’t finish the fight last time, come and finish it this time!”

Yong Ji looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Do you really dare to fight with me?”

“Do you think... I’m joking with you!”

Along with Qin Yu’s shout, the Vajra sacred physique and the fighting word formula were activated at this moment!

The dense spiritual power on Qin Yu’s body swept out in all directions with him as the center!

The entire Dead Sea rippled at this moment, and the space around Qin Yu collapsed!

Sensing the internal Qi on Qin Yu’s body, everyone couldn’t help but turn pale with fright!

This internal Qi really came from Qin Yu? How could this be possible?

Even Xiao Hai, who was below, couldn’t help but be slightly stunned before he laughed out loud.

“Good! Qin Yu, I’ll leave Yongji to you!”Xiao Hai shouted loudly.

Qin Yu looked at Yongji coldly and said, “You better bring out your true ability. I Won’t give you any chance to catch your breath.”

At this moment, Qin Yu had directly activated the fifth level of the fighting word formula!

Even Qin Yu himself didn’t know how terrifying this strength was!

On the other side of the bank, Sima Bei’s expression was terrifyingly cold.

“This bastard... has indeed come.”Sima bei took a deep breath.

One of his physical bodies had died at Qin Yu’s hands. There was naturally no need to say anything about his hatred towards Qin Yu.

“Send someone to help Yongji.”Sima bei immediately ordered.

“Yes.”The person beside him did not dare to say anything. He immediately followed Sima Bei’s request and sent someone to assist Yongji.

Yongji’s face was solemn. He clenched his fist and said in a low voice, “Brat, you think too highly of yourself. Do you really think that I’m afraid of You?”

“You sure talk a lot of nonsense.”Qin Yu mocked.

“Alright, since that’s the case, then don’t blame me for being impolite!”

Yong Ji roared and his figure suddenly disappeared. In an instant, he was in front of Qin Yu!

This speed made people speechless. In just an instant, his fist had already smashed onto Qin Yu’s face!

“Bang!”It was like a collision of steel. It was extremely ear-piercing!

But the result was shocking! Qin Yu stood there, not moving at all.

Yong Ji was stunned, and then his expression changed drastically!

“Didn’t I say that I want you to show your true ability, or else you won’t have a chance.”

Qin Yu’s cold voice was like a life-threatening talisman, entering Yong Ji’s ears.

“Not good!”

Yong Ji suddenly had a bad feeling and immediately planned to retreat, but Qin Yu was one step faster!

His golden palm drew a parabola, and with a “PA”sound, it slapped Yong Ji’s face!

Yong Ji was instantly sent flying by the slap. Like a bullet, he shot towards the ground explosively.

“Boom!”

His entire body crashed into the ground, creating a huge crater in the ground. Smoke and dust flew everywhere!

Everyone was stunned by this scene!

Yong Ji was sent flying by a Slap? How was this possible?

Furthermore, his fist had clearly smashed into Qin Yu’s face. Why did Qin Yu not react at all?

Just how terrifying was Qin Yu’s physical body?

“Hahaha! Well Done!”Xiao Hai could not help but laugh out loud.

Yong Ji’s furious Roar also came from the crater.

When the dust had dispersed, half of his face had been shattered. Fresh blood dripped down, and he looked extremely miserable!

Coupled with his furious expression, he looked extremely ferocious, as if he was a demon.
