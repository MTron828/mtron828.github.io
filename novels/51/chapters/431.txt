Although the voice wasn’t loud, it fell into everyone’s ears.

They saw the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion standing behind them.

She wasn’t tall, but she had an imposing manner.

No one could ignore her presence.

Xiaoru sized up the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion and said, “Who are you?”

The Pavilion Master glanced at Xiaoru and raised her palm to slap Xiaoru’s face!

This slap sent Xiaoru flying!

“You...” Xiaoru got up from the ground. Just as she was about to say something, the two people beside her quickly cupped their hands and said, “Greetings, Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

The Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?

Hearing this name, Xiaoru felt as if a fishbone was stuck in her throat. She was speechless.

“Master!” Soon, Taozi ran over from behind.

The master didn’t say anything. She looked at the three people and said coldly, “Get lost!”

Although Xiaoru was unhappy, she didn’t dare to cross the Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. She could only leave in a hurry.

Qin Yu forced a smile.

Why did the master suddenly come here?

This... completely disrupted his plans.

“Greetings, Lord Pavilion Master.” Qin Yu walked forward and bowed.

The Pavilion Master’s long and narrow eyes swept over Qin Yu.

In an instant, Qin Yu felt as if he was being seen through!

Qin Yu had only felt this kind of feeling from Mr. Xia of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!

“Lord Pavilion Master, you must help Elder Qin...” Taozi said anxiously from the side.

The Pavilion Master looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Follow me.”

“Yes.” Qin Yu forced a smile.

He followed behind Pavilion Master and came to a room.

Then, the Pavilion Master gently raised her hand and placed it on Qin Yu’s dantian.

In a moment, the Pavilion Master frowned.

She looked up at Qin Yu and said, “I see.”

Qin Yu forced a smile and said, “As expected, nothing can be hidden from the Pavilion Master.”

The Pavilion Master didn’t continue, but asked coldly, “Why did you do that?”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, then slowly said, “There are three reasons.”

“First, the current me is absolutely no match for Han Wei, and the fastest way for me to cultivate is to devour the inner strength of others.”

“Second, I keep feeling that someone is trying to kill me in the dark.”

This feeling was very intense, but Qin Yu didn’t know who it was.

Qin Yu made enemies from all sides. He did have many enemies on the surface, but he knew nothing about the enemies in the dark.

“Third... if I continue like this, I will definitely attract the attention of the Yan family and the Han family. If they ignore the rumors and send a Martial Marquis Realm martial artist to deal with me, then I will definitely die.”

After the Pavilion Master heard this, she said indifferently, “So, does this mean that I have ruined your plans?”

Qin Yu forced a smile and said, “That is indeed the case, but your arrival might be more believable.”

“Everyone in the world knows that I am an Elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. If you do not appear for a long time, it will naturally arouse suspicion.”

The Pavilion Master nodded slightly. She took a sip of tea and then said indifferently, “What plans do you have next?”

Qin Yu raised his head. His eyes were filled with resolve.

“Go with the flow and fight to the death,” Qin Yu said coldly. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Oh?” The Pavilion Master seemed a little surprised.

Qin Yu leaned on the Pavilion Master’s ear and whispered his plan.

After hearing it, the Pavilion Master frowned slightly.

“Qin Yu, are you sure you want to do this?” The Pavilion Master said with a serious tone.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “The time left for me is too little. I won’t waste a single bit of it.”

“Have you considered the consequences of doing this? What if you are really killed one day?” The Pavilion Master asked coldly.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “There is a saying that goes, ‘If you die, you will be reborn’.”

Hearing this, the Pavilion Master immediately fell silent.

After a long time, she slowly stood up and turned around to leave.

When she reached the door, the Pavilion Master stopped and said, “I understand.”

“Thank you, Pavilion Master.” Qin Yu bowed with a respectful expression.

That day, the Pavilion Master left Chuzhou.

Such speed was indeed surprising.

“Elder Qin, what did the Pavilion Master say? Does she have a way?” Asked Taozi.

Qin Yu glanced at Taozi, shook his head and said, “Our negotiation was very unpleasant.”

“Huh? How could this be?” Taozi’s face suddenly became a bit pale.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He sat cross-legged on the sofa and muttered in a low voice, “They will definitely come again. The temptation of the Meridian Circulation Technique is too great.”

...

The Martial Arts Forum was the most lively at night.

It was even more so this night.

It wasn’t known since when, but Qin Yu had become a regular visitor to the Martial Arts Forum.

Almost every day, there would be people discussing Qin Yu.

And it was on this night that an important piece of news spread:

“The Divine Alchemist Pavilion will strip Qin Yu of his status as an Elder tomorrow.”

It was just a few short words, but it had already caused a sensation throughout the entire Martial Arts Forum!

As the top medical organization in the martial arts world, and even the entire country, the actions of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion would cause a stir in the entire country.

And the personnel changes of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion would also be made public to the public.

For example, the appointment of the Elders, the expulsion and so on, would all be made public at the first instance.

Upon seeing this piece of news, there was a buzz of discussion.

“Qin Yu has actually been kicked out of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion!”

“Heavens, looks like Qin Yu’s dantian has really been injured.”

“Mm, the Divine Alchemist Pavilion has always only recruited elites, and has never taken in trash.”

“Even the Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s Pavilion Master was unable to do anything about it. Qin Yu is completely finished.”

Even the country’s martial arts potential rankings had removed Qin Yu’s name that night.

This was the influence of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion!

At that moment, Qin Yu was lying on his bed with his eyes closed.

In his mind, countless rays of golden light flashed past. Each ray was a top-tier cultivation technique.

At this moment, the bedroom door was pushed open with a bang.

Then, he saw Taozi and Yao Qing walk in with sad and angry looks on their faces.

“What’s wrong?” Qin Yu sat up from the bed and asked despite knowing the answer.

Taozi bit her rosy lips with her white teeth. She gritted her teeth and said, “I really didn’t expect the Divine Alchemist Pavilion to be so heartless!”

“They actually kicked you out of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion!” Yao Qing also said with a face full of anger.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Isn’t that right? The Divine Alchemist Pavilion is full of geniuses to begin with. How can I stay when I am useless?”

“But... isn’t kicking you out at such a time adding insult to injury?” Taozi said angrily.

“I really was blind to join the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

After saying that, Taozi took out the Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s token from her waist and threw it on the ground.

The token immediately shattered into pieces.
