2155 The Negotiation

The scene was indescribably silent. Everyone seemed immersed in this state of shock and could not extricate themselves.

After an unknown period of time, an elder walked up to Yan Tianshi and asked, “Holy Lord Yan, is Flower Granny really the number one person in ten thousand years?”

Yan Tianshi glanced at him and said, “Isn’t Flower Granny’s strength evident? Who is Si Liuhe? He had voluntarily submitted. Isn’t that self-explanatory?”

Everyone gasped when they heard that.

“In that case, doesn’t it mean we can’t touch Qin Yu?” someone exclaimed, realizing something.

Yan Tianshi shook his head and said, “Flower Granny is indeed powerful, but it doesn’t mean we can’t do anything to her. After all, other than personal strength, there are many ways to kill people in this world.

“Moreover, Flower Granny was originally unwilling to participate in this matter. If it weren’t for Dean Lei, she definitely wouldn’t have taken action today.”

Everyone agreed with Yan Tianshi. They did not stay any longer and left immediately after.

Upon returning to the Si family, Liu Si Liuhe locked himself in his cave abode. He did not leave the place, and no one knew what he was thinking about.

The fact that Flower Granny had taken action quickly spread throughout the entire Holy Region!

“Did you guys hear? Flower Granny made a move on Astral Mountain!”

“Flower Granny? Is she the one who was known as the number one person in the Holy Region a few thousand years ago?”

“Yes, it’s her. I heard that she easily dispelled Si Liuhes dao technique. She could have suppressed Si Liuhe directly if she hadn’t shown mercy!”

“What? Si Liuhe? Even Si Liuhe was no match for her?”

“Not only that, Yan Tianshi even made her the number one person in ten thousand years!”

“It seems that Flower Granny’s strength has not diminished since then… The title of the number one person in ten thousand years was somewhat too overbearing!”

For a moment, everyone was discussing this matter. Flower Granny, who had been silent for so many years, had reappeared and attacked aggressively. It inevitably made people reminisce about her dominance in the past.

She was indeed the only person who had suppressed heaven’s favorite of an era with her full strength!

If it weren’t for the fact that she could not vindicate dao due to the rules of heavens and earth, Flower Granny would have already stepped into the Tribulation Transcending Stage or even a higher realm.

…

Meanwhile, Dean Lei had already brought Qin Yu back to Thunder Courtyard.

Dean Lei’s injuries were not severe. He only needed to rest and recuperate for some time before he fully recovered.

Compared to Dean Lei, Qin Yu’s injuries were much more severe.

He had unleashed techniques to forcibly increase his strength, causing his vitality to be badly damaged. His entire body was tremendously weak, and he collapsed on the bed.

But even so, Qin Yu still propped himself up with difficulty.

Dean Lei sat beside him. He looked at Qin Yu with a slightly solemn expression.

However, when he faced Qin Yu, his expression returned to normal, and he concealed that hint of solemnness perfectly.

“Dean Lei, you don’t have to accompany me to Peach Blossom Island after three days,” Qin Yu opened his mouth and said weakly.

Dean Lei glared at Qin Yu and scolded, “What nonsense are you talking about? If I don’t go, they will definitely get rid of you!”

At this point, Dean Lei changed the subject, smiled, and said, “Don’t worry. With me around, they can’t do anything to you.”

Even though Dean Lei pretended to be very relaxed, the hint of worry hidden in his heart could not escape Qin Yu’s eyes.

After all, they were the nine great aristocratic families. Although Thunder Courtyard was powerful, it could not deal with the joint forces of the nine great aristocratic families.

“Dean Lei, I’ve already caused you a lot of trouble,” Qin Yu said bitterly.

“There’s no need to say anything else. Everything is under control!” Dean Lei waved his hand, stood up, and said, “You should rest well. I will bring my celestial artifact to Peach Blossom Island three days later. I don’t believe they can do anything to me!”

After saying this, Dean Lei turned around and walked out.

Qin Yu sighed. He lay on the bed, feeling tremendously bitter in his heart.

If it weren’t for the linen-robed elderly man from the Ni family, Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue would have embarked on a new journey.

“D*mn, it’s a little bit away!” Qin Yu could not help but clench his fists, his eyes filled with defeat and unwillingness.

Faced with the Ni family’s obstruction, what he could do was limited. There was still a tremendous gap between his cultivation and theirs.

The current situation was beyond his control. The Ni family, the Yan family, Flower Granny, and Si Liuhe each was a top-notch existence, and he was trapped in the middle, unable to extricate himself.

Looking at the ceiling, Qin Yu sighed silently. He knew that he had to find a solution. Otherwise, everything would only get worse.

On one hand, he could not let Dean Lei bear all the pressure alone.

On the other hand, he could not give up on Yan Ruoxue. That was what he had always insisted on.

…

In the residence of the Yan family, Yan Tianshi sat on Dragon Peak with a cold expression.

Beside him was Yan Guyun, who had not come out of seclusion for a long time.

At this moment, Yan Guyun’s internal qi had become even more powerful. It was obvious that he had already stepped into the True Saint Realm.

However, he had not appeared for a long time, and no one knew why. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“We can’t let Yan Ruoxue join the negotiation three days later,” Yan Guyun said coldly.

Yan Tianshi glanced at him and said, “Do you think I want her to follow? If I don’t let her go, I’m afraid she’ll hate me for the rest of her life.”

“So what if she hates you?” Yan Guyun did not mind at all. He said with slight displeasure, “Yan Ruoxue is just an outsider and not your biological daughter. I just don’t understand why you would give up on Yunfan for Yan Ruoxue.”

Yan Tianshi’s face turned cold, and he said coldly, “Don’t ever mention this matter again. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being rude!”

After hearing Yan Tianshi’s words, Yan Guyun was a little unhappy but did not say anything else.

“I hope there will be a good outcome three days later,” Yan Guyun stood up and said. After saying this, he turned around and left.

In the following three days, everything seemed calm. However, everyone knew that this negotiation would not be easy. No matter which side, they would not easily relent.

The nine great aristocratic families would be present. Most importantly, the Prince of Great Xia would be there too.

Even though the current prince was just a figurehead, everyone still wanted to use his voice to announce the outcome of the negotiation.

On Mount Donghuang, Yan Ruoxue sat cross-legged on the edge of the cliff. The breeze blew past her long hair. Her cold countenance carried a hint of indescribable pain and despair, forming a sharp contrast with the beautiful scenery in the surrounding.

Her snow-white dress was still stained with fresh blood like flowers as if she was recounting an experience that was hard to conceal.
