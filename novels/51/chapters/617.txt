Chapter 618: Two Supreme Treasures! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The pestle in Qin Yu’s hand was trembling non-stop as it shattered into pieces!

The man with the mustache looked extremely terrified as he said in a trembling voice, “I... I’ve never seen such a scene... this pestle actually shattered!”

Qin Yu’s expression was also a little nervous.

One had to know that this pestle came from Buddhism.

It was imbued with an extremely powerful power of faith and an aura of peace capable of restraining all evil in the world.

But now, this pestle actually shattered!

“Let’s go. No treasure is more important than our life.” The man with the mustache pulled Qin Yu and was about to leave.

However, Qin Yu said coldly, “If you want to leave, you can leave. I’m not leaving. The more dangerous the place, the more opportunities there are.”

Qin Yu didn’t have much time left, so he had to take the risk.

As long as he could improve his strength, everything was worth it.

After saying that, Qin Yu strode forward.

The man with the mustache hesitated for a moment. Finally, he gritted his teeth and muttered, “F * ck, I’ll go. I don’t believe that it can kill me!”

Therefore, the man with the mustache quickly caught up.

The deeper they went, the denser the dark energy became.

When they reached the deepest part of the cave, they found it difficult to even breathe.

The spiritual energy in their bodies had been completely suppressed and frozen. All their cultivation couldn’t be used at this moment.

“Look, what’s that?!”

At this moment, Qin Yu pointed at a concave wall not far away and said.

At a glance, the concave looked like a room with an open door.

“Qin Yu, go and see what that is,” the man with the mustache whispered behind Qin Yu.

Qin Yu didn’t pay attention to the man with the mustache. He held the lamp and walked toward the sunken wall.

“Huh?”

When he saw the scene in front of him, Qin Yu’s expression couldn’t help but change.

In front of him was an extremely large coffin!

Most importantly, there were two corpses on both sides of the coffin!

“The corpses are not placed in the coffin, but on both sides of the coffin?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

He tried to feel the dark energy. As expected, the dark energy in the tomb came from here.

Staring at the coffin, Qin Yu couldn’t help but fall into deep thought.

This coffin was carved with dragons and phoenixes. It was unknown what material the coffin was made of, but it didn’t show any signs of decay after so many years.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and reached out his hand to open the coffin.

“Don’t move!”

At this time, the man with the mustache hurriedly shouted.

He walked quickly to Qin Yu and stared at the coffin.

“What’s wrong?” Qin Yu asked.

The man with the mustache ignored Qin Yu and kept repeating, “It’s really that woman’s tomb!”

Qin Yu asked in puzzlement, “How do you know?”

The man with the mustache pointed to the side of the coffin and said in a deep voice, “Look at this picture. It’s that woman’s mask.”

Qin Yu looked over and saw the picture of the mask as expected.

And this picture was the mask in Xiao Yu’s hand!

“What does Xiao Yu have to do with that woman?!” The doubt on Qin Yu’s face became more and more intense.

Could it be that Xiao Yu was really the reincarnation of that woman?

It had been a long time since Qin Yu had visited Xiao Yu, and he didn’t know how powerful she was now.

“Open the coffin,” Qin Yu said.

The man with the mustache was a bit solemn as he said in a low voice, “I’m afraid that when the coffin is opened, there won’t be a treasure, but a murderous internal qi.”

Qin Yu frowned. “Are we just going to leave it there?”

The man with the mustache couldn’t make up his mind for a moment.

He took out one Magic Artifact after another from the Spatial Magic Artifact to use them to resist.

But in the end, all the Magic Artifacts were given up by the man with the mustache.

“What’s wrong?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but ask when he saw the situation.

The man with the mustache smiled bitterly and said, “These Magic Artifacts of mine are definitely top-notch treasures in the world, but in front of her, they are just a pile of junk. They are useless.”

“Then open it directly,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

After saying that, he immediately summoned his spiritual power and pushed it toward the coffin.

The coffin was extremely heavy. Even Qin Yu had to use a lot of strength to push it.

After more than ten minutes, Qin Yu finally opened a hole in the coffin.

During this time, the man with the mustache stood by the side with a nervous expression.

Boom!

With a loud bang, the coffin was finally opened!

“What’s inside?” The man with the mustache ran over in a hurry.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “There’s no corpse? That’s strange...”

At a glance, there was a black bracelet, a picture, and a piece of clothing inside the coffin.

“This clothing should belong to that woman,” Qin Yu said while looking at the style of the clothes.

The man with the mustache didn’t have the time to pay attention to Qin Yu’s words. He hurriedly took out two treasures and said excitedly, “This... this really belongs to that woman!”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “It’s just a bracelet and a picture. There isn’t the slightest spiritual energy fluctuation on it. Can this be considered a treasure?”

The man with the mustache glared at Qin Yu and said, “What do you know?! For a person like her, even the clothes she wears aren’t ordinary!”

Qin Yu still wanted to say something, but the man with the mustache waved his hand and said, “Hurry up and divide the spoils. This place is too gloomy. I don’t want to stay here for too long.”

“I don’t want that shirt,” Qin Yu said first.

“As for these two... I want that picture. I’m a man, so I can’t wear a bracelet.”

The man with the mustache said with some heartache, “To be honest, I don’t want to give any of these two to you...”

Qin Yu said jokingly, “If I kill you, these two things will belong to me.”

The man with the mustache’s expression darkened, and he muttered, “I’ll give them to you. Can’t I give them to you?”

After taking the picture, Qin Yu still didn’t feel the slightest difference.

It looked like an ordinary picture.

The things drawn on the picture were like ghost talismans, and nothing could be understood. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“After searching for so long, I’ve only found this lousy painting,” Qin Yu muttered softly.

“Fortunately, the dark energy here is powerful enough to support my cultivation.”

However, Qin Yu’s first thought was to return first. After all, Qin Yu didn’t know what had happened in the outside world.

Moreover... he had disappeared for too long.

“Let’s go, let’s leave this place quickly,” the man with the mustache said with lingering fear.

Qin Yu nodded while thinking of leaving for the time being.

“Boom!”

At this moment, a loud sound was suddenly heard!

Qin Yu frowned. Just as he was about to speak, the corpses lying on both sides of the coffin suddenly stood up!

“It’s over!”

Upon hearing this sound, the faces of the two men instantly turned pale!

“Oh no. These two male corpses are probably guarding the tomb. Let’s hurry up and escape!” The man with the mustache said in fear.

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely unsightly as well. He immediately wanted to run.

However, these two only raised their hands, and a barrier appeared in front of them while blocking their path!

Qin Yu didn’t dare to be negligent and clenched his fist to smash it!

“Clang!”

However, the hardness of this barrier was completely beyond Qin Yu’s imagination, and he was instantly forced back!

“Qin Yu!” The man with the mustache roared loudly.

“These two male corpses are probably existences that surpass Mighty Realm powerhouses! Quickly think of a way to escape!”
