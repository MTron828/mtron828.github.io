1973 The Demon Race Attacks

Qin Yu’s words instantly made the two fall into silence.

Jue Wu and Qin Yu were rogue cultivators and didn’t care about reputation, but not the Si family.

As the Si family was in the teeth of the wind now, they didn’t dare to act recklessly.

“We, from the Si family, will remember the two of you,” the young Semi-Saint said coldly.

!!

“Don’t think we can’t do anything to you just because you’re hiding in Sky City. You can only hide for a while, but not forever!”

After saying this, the two turned around and left.

Qin Yu and Jue Wu stood there motionless, quietly watching them leave.

After they left, the prince sighed and walked over.

“Qin Yu, do you really plan to hide in Sky City forever? You’ve seen it yourself before. They even used the magical artifact to drag you into the void and separate you from the Sky City’s territory,” the prince said.

Qin Yu looked at the prince and said, “It’s not up to me to decide now. As the Si family is determined to eliminate me, I can only take it one step at a time.”

“What’s there to be afraid of? If they dare to come, I’ll kill them!” Jue Wu said ferociously.

With Jue Wu here, Qin Yu was indeed somewhat relieved.

Although this fellow liked to cause trouble, she was one of the few people he could trust unconditionally.

“Your Highness, thank you for your kindness.” Qin Yu bowed to the prince and then left with Jue Wu.

On their way, Qin Yu didn’t say anything. No one knew what he was thinking.

The people around seemed to have heard the news, and they all pointed at Qin Yu, discussing among themselves.

“Tsk! Tsk! Did you hear the news? Qin Yu’s just offended the Si family, and now he’s offended the Yao family.”

“Yeah, he’s really a troublemaker.”

“He offends everyone wherever he goes. It is simply unheard of.”

Hearing what they said, Qin Yu could not help but sneer.

He wanted to explain. However, he knew no matter what he said, it would just be taken as a joke in their ears.

There was no such thing as offending or not offending. t was purely a matter of difference in level.

Qin Yu’s rise would certainly pose a threat to the nine great aristocratic families. Naturally, he would become a thorn in their side.

Unfortunately, these people could never understand this principle. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Qin Yu, what are you thinking?” Jue Wu asked curiously.

Qin Yu looked at Jue Wu and found her staring at him with eyes opened wide and an innocent look.

There was no worldliness in her eyes, just like a lake with clear water.

“I’m thinking about how I can change the current situation,” Qin Yu said.

“You’re a smart kid. You’ll definitely think of a way, right?” Jue Wu chuckled and said.

“There’s no other way, ” Qin Yu said in a deep voice. “We have to instill fear in them if we don’t want to be restricted by them.”

“Instill fear? Do they fear anything?” Jue Wu was slightly surprised.

“Everyone has something they fear,” Qin Yu sneered and said. “They’re no exception.”

“Jue Wu, how much command do you have over the power of the purple cloud pearl now?” Qin Yu asked at this point.

Jue Wu scratched her head and said, “Probably a third of it…”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. As expected, Jue Wu was not in full command of the power of the purple cloud pearl.

Yan Ruoxue had personally said before that the power of the purple cloud pearl was even more valuable than a Saint Weapon.

“With merely one-third of it, you’ve already defeated a Semi-Saint. If you improve a little more, even the Si family will have to pay a price if they want to attack us,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Currently, Jue Wu could absolutely suppress everyone in his generation, everyone! That included Si Shiyue!

“Jue Wu, you may go,” Qin Yu suddenly said at this moment.

Jue Wu was stunned. Then she jumped up and patted Qin Yu’s head, scolding, “What nonsense are you talking? Where can I go? I’ll slap you!”

“I’m not joking with you,” Qin Yu said earnestly.”You go away now. Stay away from me.”

“You’re f*cking crazy!” Jue Wu’s face was somewhat ugly. Obviously, she was angry.

Qin Yu explained, “With your current ability, no one in the younger generation of the entire Zhongzhou is your match! You can go and challenge everyone in the Si family! Perhaps even the entire younger generation of the Holy Region!”

After hearing what Qin Yu said, Jue Wu seemed to understand something.

“If you publicly challenge them, we won’t lose anything even if they don’t accept it. At least we can distract their attention,” Qin Yu said.

“But if someone accepts the challenge, they would be the ones to suffer.”

Jue Wu understood what Qin Yu meant now.

She scratched her head and mumbled, “But they don’t have to pay attention to me. They’re all high and mighty…”

“No.” Qin Yu shook his head. “We’re not the same. You’re Dean Lei’s closed-door disciple. This identity is enough to be on the same level as the disciples of the nine great aristocratic families.

Jue Wu suddenly came to a realization. She rubbed her hands and said, “Alright, it’s decided then! I indeed don’t like them to begin with!”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “But you must remember one thing, not to kill them. You have to know your limits. It will be troublesome if you force them to do something out of desperation.”

“Don’t worry. I know what I’m doing!” Jue Wu patted her chest and said.

On the same day, Jue Wu left Sky City.

Qin Yu was not worried about Jue Wu’s safety. Not to mention her exaggerating strength and the Saint Weapon in her hand, Jue Wu’s identity as Dean Lei’s closed-door disciple alone was enough to stop anyone in the Holy Region from doing anything to her.

...

After Jue Wu left, Qin Yu also began to think about how to deal with the situation.

Qin Yu’s injuries had not recovered yet, and it would probably take a few more days. Thus she was not in a hurry to cultivate.

After thinking for a while, Qin Yu decided to make a trip to Donghuang. Xiao Sheng had said before. There were big opportunities there.

Qin Yu planned to sell all the ores in his hands for spirit coins the following few days. Then he would try his luck at the auction, gambling house, and Alchemist Association in Sky City, hoping to use the dragon blood to refine a batch of pills.

In the following few days, Qin Yu swallowed the pills in his hand according to master Yun’s requirements.

After three days, Qin Yu had already recovered most of his strength.

On the fourth day, Qin Yu went out to sell the ores he had.

However, at this moment, a piece of shocking news spread across the majority of Zhongzhou.

A young man had made a move against the heirs of the nine great aristocratic families. In just three days, he had killed two of the heirs of the aristocratic families!

Qin Yu’s face turned gloomy when he heard the news. He suddenly had a bad feeling.

“Could it be Jue Wu…” Qin Yu frowned.

...

Jue Wu had just left Sky City, and such news was spreading. He could not avoid feeling worried.

But soon, Qin Yu dispelled that thought.

It was because the young man who attacked was not from a human race, but a demon race!
