He should not have the time to care about this matter for the time being.

At this moment, it had only been nearly a month since the incomplete version of the Investiture of Gods appeared.

In this month, the information that had happened had already caused a huge shock to the Saint World.

One had to know that if there were any clues about the appearance of the Investiture of Gods, the 18 Holy Lords would not hesitate to show their true forms.

Some of the monsters in the Saint World would probably fight for it with all their might.

However, the incomplete version at the bottom of the Nine Nether Cliff had appeared too suddenly.

Only those who happened to be nearby could rush over. Otherwise, it would be a question mark as to who the final few people were.

“It’s the Investiture of Gods! Although it’s just an incomplete page, it’s enough to change the overall situation of the Saint World. I wonder if it’s good or bad for the human race.”

In the Saint Kingdom, three people were playing chess and chatting in the clouds.

“I’ve already sent an invitation to the Situ family in the name of Xinghe, Shen Xiao, and Ding Guan to study the secret together. I wonder how the Situ family will respond. ”

Ding Guang, the Dipamkara Buddha, was sitting cross-legged on the ground. His hand was gently twirling prayer beads.

“Although the Situ family is close to the human race’s Saint Kingdom, I’m afraid they won’t share the power that doesn’t belong to the Saint World. Even if I were to obtain it, I’d probably do the same. However, something big may happen in this world since the incomplete Investiture of Gods has appeared.

Shenxiao Luoli shook her ponytail.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The tree branch stabbed into the sand table. The point marked there was none other than the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom.

This place would probably become the center of chaos.

“My Buddha is merciful. This is the only Saint Kingdom among the 18 Saint Kingdoms that doesn’t have a Holy Lord. This place will be the key point of the game. Now, Bai Zizai and Zi Yan are confirmed to be among them. The Alester and the Situ family aren’t in turmoil now, but I estimate they will also head to the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom soon. As for you, what choice would you make?”

Dipamkara chanted a Buddhist name again and looked at his two children with a smile.

“Then I’ll bring my sword and go there personally! I, Su Xinghe, have nothing to fear even if I die in the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom!”

Su Xinghe laughed loudly. His vigorous sword will soared into the sky and tore the world apart.

“Perhaps you’ve forgotten there’s one more person. He was also at the bottom of the cliff at that time. Moreover, his strength is above that of Ming Alester and Bai Zizai. I don’t believe that there’s any news about him at all. He’s from the Faramita.”

Su Xinghe said with a smile.

“He has long betrayed the Faramita. However, what Holy Lord Su said did remind me that this person might also have an Investiture of Gods.” Dipamkara’s expression remained the same.

As a collaborator of Zi Yang, Chen Zhisha never fully displayed his power in front of everyone.

When he was fighting with Qin Yu at the bottom of the cliff, he suddenly retreated and left.

At this moment, Su Xinghe had already confirmed that this bald monk was picking up the bargain.

Chen Zhisha, who happened to be at the bottom of the cliff, would never give up such a thing.

The incomplete version of the Investiture of Gods was like a butterfly slowly flapping its wings.

The entire Saint World had already begun to undergo a huge change.

A loud and clear sword cry rose from the Xinghe Saint Kingdom. Wherever it passed, the entire space split into an independent balloon space.

His body could not be locked on. His speed exceeded the speed of light.

It was already at the level of being present and absent in space. No matter how top-notch an expert was, they could not lock this sword light.

Almost at the same time, countless terrifying powers gathered in a certain place.

The destination of these people was the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom.

“It’s the Investiture of Gods.” Wu Tian had a strange look on his face. At this moment, the power of the Seven Tribulations Sin coiled around his hand.

In the Situ family of the Treasure Continent.

After experiencing nearly a month of squirming, Qin Yu’s body had already transformed again.

At this moment, his eyes flickered with a divine radiance that made one’s heart palpitate.

His strength had increased again.

He did not emit the peak power. He was still at level 9 Dao Consciousness now, but the power on his body was enough to make Lance and the others feel their hair stand on end.

Countless tentacles were like vipers, instantly covering the entire space.

It enveloped all the people in the dark.

Boom!

Amidst the terrifying power, the tentacles seemed to have hit a transparent wall.

The attack did not work. The smashed tentacles slowly slid down, emitting an indescribable fishy smell.

Boom!

At this moment, Lance suddenly felt a mountain-like pressure on his body. His bones gave off a loud sound, which sounded like the sound of bones cracking.

A destructive power descended when the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze completely opened.

Boom!

A giant that was three meters tall rushed out and slammed his palm against the power of the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze.

He became stronger again!

Giant Rakshasa looked solemn.

It had only been a few days since he had been able to suppress the other party. However, he had already increased his strength at an unbelievable speed.

And now, he could barely have a 50 – 50 chance of winning.

Moreover, this person would not die no matter what.

Looking at the pair of eyes without human emotions, he felt a little cold. “What’s wrong, Rakshasa? You can’t hold on anymore?”

Lance couldn’t help but tease when he saw Rakshasa’s expression.

“Go and try taking his attack yourself. I almost knelt when I saw you just now.”

Rakshasa retorted.

Whoosh!

Qin Yu moved his thumb.

The scene in front of everyone suddenly changed. A hellish scene descended.

A different scene appeared in everyone’s sea of consciousness.

They saw that they were experiencing terrifying torture. That feeling could actually invade their senses.

Lance saw five or six people grab him and throw him into the pot of oil. The skin on his arm trembled and dozens of huge blisters appeared on his arm.

“Why aren’t you attacking? Are you waiting for us to die?”

Lance was exasperated.

Rakshasa took out a talisman. An internal qi that was like a long sword pierced through the entire space.

The word “suppress” gave off a strong vibration.

In front of this internal qi, the power of dreams that had entered everyone’s bodies was directly annihilated.

A strange smile appeared on Qin Yu’s face and the talisman began to tremble crazily.

One was the power of dreams, and the other was the power of reality.

In conclusion, it was a clash between two types of divine sense power.

The power of the night was a higher-level internal qi that was promoted based on the power of the soul.

The power of reality was the nemesis of this kind of power. It could clear all the internal qi of the divine soul.

Even the various illusions created by the Night Qi could not resist this power..
