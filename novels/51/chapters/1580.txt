Chapter 1581: Chapter 1,581, absolute dance’s News 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“I suggest keeping this news a secret for the time being and telling it to Qin Yu in a few days’time.”

This suggestion immediately won the approval of many elders.

Di Zun said with an angry face, “Don’t you know that my master is very worried about Lord absolute dance? ! Yet now you want to hide this news. This... This is revenge for kindness!”

“Di Zun, don’t be anxious. We don’t want this either, but everything is for the sect.”The elder sighed.

Di Zun gritted his teeth and looked at the deputy sect master. There was some hope in his eyes as if he was waiting for the deputy sect master’s answer.

The Deputy Sect Master was silent for a moment. Then, he looked at di zun and said, “Go and find Qin Yu. Tell him this news.”

Di Zun was overjoyed when he heard this. He quickly nodded and said, “Okay, I’ll go now!”

“Deputy sect master! If Qin Yu leaves, it won’t be good news for the Heavenly Cloud Sect!”The elder beside him said anxiously.

The deputy sect master glanced at the elder, he slowly said, “With Qin Yu’s character, what would he do if he knew that you deliberately hid the news? “Do you think that our relationship, which we had spent so much effort to ease, will be broken because of this? “Are you trying to force Qin Yu to become an enemy of the Heavenly Cloud sect again?”

Everyone immediately fell silent. Yes, with Qin Yu’s temper, if he knew about this matter, he would definitely make a big fuss. At that time, it would be self-defeating.

“For people like Qin Yu, sincerity is the greatest weapon,”the deputy sect master slowly said.

...

In Qin Yu’s room, he was absorbing the great Yue fruit with his eyes slightly closed.

“Master, there’s News!”At this moment, Di Zun pushed the door open and said breathlessly.

Qin Yu slowly opened his eyes and said, “What News?” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“News about Master Jue Wu!”Di Zun said.

Hearing this, Qin Yu suddenly stood up.

He almost instantly came in front of Di zun and said anxiously, “How is it? where is Jue Wu Now? How is her condition now?”

Di Zun wiped his sweat and said, “I don’t know the specific situation. I only know that Jue Wu is at Qu Zhu’s place.”

“Qu Zhu?”Qin Yu was stunned.

He had actually forgotten about this person!

Before Qin Yu left, he had told Qu Zhu to keep an eye on Jue Wu. Now that Jue Wu had an accident, she should be at his place.

“The entire wind bamboo mountain has been sealed by the secret technique. Our people can’t get in, so we don’t really know how Lord Jue Wu is,”said Di Zun.

Qin Yu nodded. He took a deep breath and said, “Di Zun, tell the deputy sect master that I have gone to the wind bamboo mountain.”

Di Zun opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something, but in the end, he smiled and said, “Alright, I got it.”

Qin Yu did not stay any longer. All he could think about was Jue Wu. He immediately left the Heavenly Cloud sect.

The Moment Qin Yu left the Heavenly Cloud sect, the two godly monarchs hiding in the dark also discovered Qin Yu’s figure.

“This kid... has finally come out.”One of the godly monarchs said with a sneer.

“We have waited for him for so long. It’s time to send him on his way...”the other godly monarch said with a sinister tone.

With that said, the two immediately planned to pursue Qin Yu.

However, Qin Yu was too anxious at that moment. He did not even summon the godly eagle. Instead, he stepped on the line word formula and sped towards the wind bamboo mountain!

Seeing the speed at which Qin Yu disappeared in the blink of an eye, the two godly monarchs were immediately stunned.

“How... how can he be so fast?”One of the godly monarchs asked.

“Could it be that he knows that we are hiding in the Dark?”The other godly monarch asked in puzzlement.

The two of them never expected that they would not be able to catch up to Qin Yu at all!

“Follow his internal Qi and continue searching. We must not let him escape.”

The two of them hit it off and immediately followed Qin Yu’s direction.

At this moment, Qin Yu was desperately rushing towards the wind bamboo mountain.

The wind bamboo mountain was not far from the Heavenly Cloud sect. After all, that was where Qu Zhu lived. Naturally, he would choose an excellent place.

Qin Yu relied on the line word formula to speed along the way. In just half a day, he had arrived at the wind bamboo mountain.

Wind Bamboo Mountain was a mountain, but it was actually a manor.

The entire manor was enveloped by a dense internal QI. This internal Qi seemed gentle, but it could unleash a fatal blow at any time.

Qin Yu stood at the entrance, adjusting his internal Qi.

He took a deep breath and planned to inform Qu Zhu, but qu Zhu seemed to have already known Qin Yu’s arrival. The internal Qi around him began to disappear, and everything became clear.

“Come in.”

Qu Zhu’s voice came leisurely, extremely hollow.

Qin Yu did not dare to delay any longer. He quickly walked into the wind bamboo mountain.

Inside the mountain, Qin Yu quickly walked over while instructing qu Zhu’s internal Qi.

At this moment, Qu Zhu was sitting on a stone table drinking wine. He looked quite relaxed.

Qin Yu quickly walked over and asked anxiously, “Big Brother Qu Zhu, how is Jue Wu?”

Qu Zhu put down the wine flask in his hand and sighed slightly. He said, “She can be considered to have saved her life, but the situation is not good.”

Qin Yu’s expression changed and he hurriedly asked, “Where is she now?”

Qu Zhu pointed to a bamboo house not far away and said, “Follow me.”

The two of them walked towards the bamboo house, and the door was violently pushed open by Qin Yu.

On the bamboo bed, the extremely young Jue Wu was lying with her eyes slightly closed.

Many of her bones were damaged, and her internal Qi was also extremely unstable. It was unknown how many of her meridians were damaged.

Compared to Jue Wu’s injuries, the injuries of the deputy sect leader were not worth mentioning.

“Jue Wu!”Qin Yu walked over quickly. He half-squatted beside Jue Wu’s bed, and his expression was extremely ugly!

Qin Yu raised his palm and tried to transmit internal Qi to Jue Wu, but he found that it was useless!

What made Qin Yu feel the most despair was that he was unable to find out where Jue Wu’s injuries were!

“Don’t worry, she won’t die. It’s just that... she has temporarily lost consciousness. In other words, the current Jue Wu is a living dead person,”qu Zhu said from the side.

Qin Yu’s expression became even uglier. Anger filled his chest, and his entire body was trembling slightly.

“Is there any way?”Qin Yu suppressed his anger and looked at Qu Zhu.

Qu Zhu shook his head and said, “There shouldn’t be any way in the South Province. We can only place our hopes on the Central Province.”

The Central Province?

That’s right! That was the gathering place of all the heroes in the world! All the top alchemists were in the Central Province!

However, it was simply unrealistic to go to the central province at this moment.

“How long can she maintain this state? How long can she live?”Qin Yu asked with a cold expression.

Qu Zhu said in a low voice, “A year.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “I understand...”

Following that, he lowered his head and looked at Jue Wu.

At this moment, Jue Wu seemed to be asleep. Her exquisite and pure face made people involuntarily feel heartache upon seeing it.

“Godly monarch of the northern lands...”Qin Yu whispered this name.

A moment later, he raised his head to look at Qu Zhu and said coldly, “I want to send a challenge to the godly monarch of the northern lands.”
