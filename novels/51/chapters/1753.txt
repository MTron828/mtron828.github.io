1754 Qin Yu Awakens

No matter which angle one looked at it from, it was the figure of Yuan Xiu!

“What kind of strange spell is this?” Wen Wanchong frowned.

“I don’t know, I don’t know if I can think of a way to escape... Pfft!”

Qu Zhu didn’t even get to finish his words before he suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood!

This mouthful of blood came extremely suddenly, and no one knew what had happened!

“What’s going on?” Wen Wanchong said hurriedly.

Qu Zhu shook his head and said. “I don’t know. I just feel like there’s a huge rock pressing on my chest...”

Wen Wanchong’s face turned pale.

His body couldn’t help but tremble and fall down, as if an invisible force was pressing down on Wen Wanchong!

“This is an absolute domain.” Yuan Xiu said coldly.

“In this world, I am the master. I only need to move my mind and I can take your lives.”

Yuan Xiu was clearly enraged.

This technique was a forbidden technique of the Immortal Slaying Sect and was extremely terrifying!

Yuan Xiu was obviously trying to get rid of the three of them as soon as possible by using this spell.

“Kneel down!”

At this moment, Yuan Xiu suddenly shouted!

The three of them knelt down involuntarily!

Qu Zhu gritted his teeth and used all his strength to resist the force, but his body still bent down involuntarily!

“Plop!”

In less than half a minute, Qu Zhu’s knees had slammed into the ground, crushing them into pieces!

“Ah!”

Wen Wanchong roared desperately, his body was emitting a blood-red aura, and his body was almost crushed!

Not long after, Wen Wanchong also knelt on the ground, unable to move!

Yuan Xiu was rather satisfied. He glanced at the three of them, but his eyes frowned slightly.

He saw that Jue Wu was trying her best to resist this power. Although it was extremely difficult, she didn’t show any signs of kneeling!

“I’m really surprised.” Yuan Xiu said coldly.

He raised his finger and pressed it in Jue Wu’s direction.

“Let’s see how long you can last.” Yuan Xiu said coldly.

As his finger pressed down, Jue Wu couldn’t take it anymore.

However, she was different from Wen Wanchong and Qu Zhu. Her entire body was sprawled on the ground instead of kneeling.

“You have some ability.” Yuan Xiu said indifferently.

“But it’s just a stubborn resistance. In this world, you are not even ants.”

In this world, Yuan Xiu seemed to be able to control everything.

He could even control the lives of these three people. He was the heavenly dao of this world!

The Immortal Slaying Sect’s creation of such a technique was truly terrifying!

Inside the Divine Capital City.

Qin Yu, who was lying on the bed, suddenly opened his eyes!

The effects of the Reversion Void Pill on him were not as terrifying as he had imagined. In less than ten days, he had woken up.

Qin Yu rubbed his chest, feeling a little tired and on the verge of running out of spiritual energy.

But when Qin Yu looked around, he was a little confused.

His surroundings were pitch-black, and the sun could not be seen.

Everything in the Divine Capital City seemed to have disappeared.

“Not good, Yuan... Yuan Xiu is charging in!” Qin Yu quickly came back to his senses!

When he looked up, he could see the terrifying face of Yuan Xiu! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qin Yu did not dare to think too much. He hurriedly activated his desolate divine eye and scanned into the distance, trying to find out everything.

“Master, Qu Zhu, and... Jue Wu!”

Qin Yu’s face turned extremely ugly when he saw what was happening in the distance!

He gritted his teeth and decided to get up.

However, at this moment, Qin Yu had no strength in his body at all. He even found it difficult to stand up!

That feeling was as if his consciousness had already awakened, but his body was still in a state of deep sleep!

“I’m already tired of playing with you guys. In this world, if I want you to die, you will die.” Yuan Xiu’s voice could be heard from all directions!

After hearing his words, Qin Yu’s expression changed greatly!

“This won’t do. If this continues, the three of them will die without a doubt,” Qin Yu’s face was solemn.

Then, Qin Yu took a deep breath, gritted his teeth, and stood up.

“Yuan Xiu, come at me!” Qin Yu raised his head and roared in the direction of Yuan Xiu!

However, Yuan Xiu did not seem to hear him and ignored him.

He raised his huge palm, which seemed to be holding a planet. It was extremely terrifying!

“I’m going to make all of you disappear along with this world.” Yuan Xiu said coldly.

He held the power in his hand and slowly raised his huge palm.

Yuan Xiu was really planning to destroy this world!

Once he succeeded, even a great golden immortal would not be able to save them!

“No...” Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He tried his best to mobilize the energy in his body, but his body still refused to listen to him.

“Ah!”

Qin Yu looked like he was going crazy. He raised his head and roared, and golden lights were faintly visible on his body!

In his mind, scene after scene kept flashing. A force emerged in his body!

“Ah!”

With Qin Yu’s roar, the golden energy finally burst out!

At this moment, Qin Yu’s entire body was bathed in golden light. His body instantly became extremely huge, almost as high as the sky of this world!

The golden light illuminated the world. Qin Yu’s huge body shocked everyone!

“It’s... It’s Qin Yu!”

Wen Wanchong quickly looked at the huge body.

“This kid actually woke up at this time.” Qu Zhu’s brows furrowed.

“It’s over, it’s over. This silly boy, isn’t he just courting death?” Jue Wu whispered.

Qin Yu glared at Yuan Xiu coldly and said, “Yuan Xiu, you’ve finally barged in...”

“Hahahaha, Qin Yu, you’ve come at the right time. I’m not willing to let you die in a coma.” Yuan Xiu said indifferently.

“If you destroy this world, you, Sima Bei, and Yong Ji will all die!” Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said.

“Oh? Is that so?” Yuan Xiu, on the other hand, had a look of ridicule on his face. With a thought, his body emitted rays of light that enveloped him.

Yong Ji and Sima Bei were lying on the ground in the distance, along with He Teng, and were also enveloped by this light.

“I am the master of this world. Whoever I want alive, will live. Whoever I want dead, will die.” Yuan Xiu said indifferently.

“F*ck you! F*ck!” Qin Yu cursed and clenched his fist as he charged at Yuan Xiu.

However, Qin Yu’s body did not have any strength to speak of. The moment her golden fist touched Yuan Xiu, it dimmed.

Yuan Xiu held Qin Yu’s fist with one hand and sneered. “You maggots who don’t know death, you actually dare to shout in front of a god like me!”
