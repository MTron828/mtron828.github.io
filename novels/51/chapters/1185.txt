Chapter 1186: Chapter 1,186, a strange change 

In the end, Qin Yu decided on twenty spots. The remaining ten spots would be handed over to Lu Yun for his own selection.

The next day.

Qin Yu handed this list over to Lu Yun. As for the remaining people, he would let Lu Yun make his own selection public.

The news of the people from the holy region settling down in the Heaven Gate had long spread, and many people were getting restless.

After the news of the public selection was released, countless people gathered in the Heaven Gate, intending to take a gamble.

Although there weren’t many warriors on Earth, this was still a long process, and it would probably take several days.

At this time, in the Yan family.

Yan Jinyao was pleading bitterly, “Dad, the people from the holy region have already arrived. You have to think of a way to get a spot for me. Otherwise, my life will be over...”

Yan Sihai’s face was also somewhat unsightly.

Although the Yan family was a large aristocratic family, they were only large in the world of capital. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

To the Martial World, the Yan family’s power was too small.

What was even more terrifying was that this person from the holy region had actually settled in the Heaven Gate!

“That person from the holy region is most likely already on the same side as Qin Yu Tong.”Yan Sihai’s brows were tightly furrowed.

Given the relationship between the Yan family and Qin Yu, it was simply too difficult to get a spot.

Having been in the business world for many years, he naturally understood the logic behind this.

“Don’t tell me I have to beg Qin Yu?”Yan Sihai smoked his cigarette, a hint of embarrassment flashing across his face.

Yan Jinyao’s face grew even uglier. His hatred for Qin Yu was no less than anyone else in the world!

Asking him to beg Qin Yu was worse than death!

“Dad, no matter what, I have to get a spot. Otherwise, I will be ruined!”A trace of determination flashed in Yan Jinyao’s eyes.

He stared at Yan Sihai and said, “I will be a grandson first and then a father. So what if I beg him? As long as I go to the Holy Region, I will have a chance to recover my body! At that time, I will take revenge!”

Yan Sihai looked at Yan Jinyao in front of him and said in a low voice, “Do you really want to go to the holy region so much? If that’s the case, I’m afraid we’ll never see each other again. You...”

“A good man’s ambition is everywhere! How can I Be Like a woman and stay at home every day!”Yan Jinyao said with some anger in his tone.

Yan Sihai opened his mouth and couldn’t help but sigh.

He only had this one son, and Yan Jinyao was very sensible since he was young. Every aspect made Yan Sihai quite satisfied.

This also caused the current Yan Sihai to be in a difficult situation.

He wanted to satisfy his son, but he didn’t want to be separated by the horizon.

After thinking for a long time, Yan Sihai put out the cigarette in his hand and said coldly, “Okay, I’ll go and beg him, Qin Yu!”

A trace of excitement flashed across Yan Jinyao’s face. He hurriedly said, “Dad, don’t worry. When I go to the Holy Region, I will definitely think of a way to kill Qin Yu and take revenge for our humiliation!”

...

On the other side, Qin Yu was also waiting.

Going to the holy region was a great temptation for any warrior, especially the geniuses of the current age.

For example, Yan Jinyao, he teng, and also the Sky Blood Rainbow.

As long as Yan Sihai came to beg him, then Qin Yu could take the opportunity to take back the Yan family and return it to old Mister Yan.

As for he teng and Tian Xuehong... As long as these two dared to show themselves, Qin Yu would never let them go!

“This is really weird.”Qin Yu paced around the room with his brows tightly knitted.

An entire day had passed, but the spiritual Qi in his body still showed no signs of recovering.

“Could it be that the Twilight Qi has affected him for so long?”Qin Yu muttered softly.

There was sadness and joy. What surprised Qin Yu even more was that his body had become a few times tougher than before.

It was not an exaggeration to say that Qin Yu was now on par with no one in the Almighty realm, let alone those of the same level.

That evening.

Qin Yu, Chang Mang, and Yao Qing strolled around the backyard of the Heaven Gate.

“Chang Mang, put away the spiritual energy in your body. Let’s Spar,”Qin Yu said.

Chang Mang was stunned, then he scratched his head and said, “You... What do you mean by this?”

“It’s a friendly spar.”Qin Yu smiled.

Chang Mang smiled embarrassedly and said, “Then I have to remind you that my body has been different from ordinary people since I was young. When I was eleven years old, I could kill a cow with my bare hands. Later on, my body was even more invulnerable.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. Of course, he knew how terrifying the holy body was.

This kind of physique was different from Qin Yu’s chaotic body. His body was hard. Even if he had not cultivated since he was young, he could still display his talent that was different from ordinary people.

However, the chaotic body was different. If the chaotic body did not step into the path of cultivation, the body would not have any changes.

“Come.”Qin Yu beckoned to Chang Mang.

“Then I won’t hold back.”Chang Mang shook his thick arm and said with a serious expression.

“I’m just afraid that you will hold back.”Qin Yu smiled.

Chang Mang did not say a word. He roared angrily and the veins on his arm instantly popped up. Then, he quickly rushed towards Qin Yu!

That huge body stirred up waves of dust, giving off an oppressive feeling.

Qin Yu also clenched his fist and went up to meet it.

“Clang!”

A loud sound spread from the middle of their fists!

Yao Qing, who was watching from the side, was temporarily deafened by the shock and kept retreating.

In the next second, Chang Mang staggered back a few steps, and his fist felt waves of pain.

He looked at his fist in surprise and exclaimed, “Damn, this is the first time I’ve met an opponent since I was young.”

Qin Yu, on the other hand, looked relaxed. This punch did not cause any harm to him.

“So Scary,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Ever since he was infected with the Twilight Qi, Qin Yu’s spiritual power had inexplicably disappeared, and his physical body had become extremely abnormal.

Chang Mang, who was not far away, could not help but mutter, “Your small body is as hard as a small iron ball.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Come, use your full strength this time. Use your spiritual power.”

After saying that, Qin Yu directly withdrew his fist, put his hands behind his back, and slightly closed his eyes.

Chang Mang was stunned. He scratched his head and said, “Qin Yu, think carefully. Although your body is indestructible, it is still very dangerous to take it head on.”
