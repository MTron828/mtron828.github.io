“A nobody?” When Liu Bu heard this, he immediately flew into a rage!

“If it weren’t for Miss Yan, you would be a nobody!” Liu Bu’s face was filled with embarrassment and anger.

Qin Yu sized up Liu Bu and said with a smile, “You... you are probably Lin Wan’s henchman, right? I remember that she seems to like someone called Mr. Yang.”

“You!” These words undoubtedly rubbed salt into Liu Bu’s wound!

Just like what Qin Yu said, he was really Lin Wan’s lap dog!

“You motherf * cker, you’re too shameless. I’ll teach you a lesson right now!” Liu Bu waved his hand, and the people around him immediately walked over to Qin Yu.

Yao Qing immediately moved forward. Just as he was about to make a move, Qin Yu stopped him.

“Let me do it,” Qin Yu said coldly.

As soon as he finished speaking, Qin Yu disappeared from the spot with a swoosh and instantly appeared in front of them.

These people were instantly stunned and their expressions changed drastically!

Before they could even react, their bodies flew out and they blacked out on the spot!

Then, Qin Yu walked towards Liu Bu step by step.

Liu Bu’s face was extremely pale. He had no idea that Qin Yu was so strong!

“You... what do you want to do?!” Liu Bu said with some fear.

Qin Yu looked at him coldly and said, “I don’t want to do anything. I just want to break your legs.”

As soon as he said that, Qin Yu quickly kicked him.

“Bang! Bang!” Liu Bu’s kneecaps were instantly shattered!

“Ouch! ! !” A pained wail echoed throughout the entire villa!

Qin Yu looked at Liu Bu coldly and said, “Get lost. Also, tell those who want to deal with me that I will wait for them here.”

“Wait, where’s the owner of this villa?” Yao Qing stopped Liu Bu and asked.

Liu Bu was scared out of his wits. He endured the pain and said, “This villa has been handed over to my father. I... I have to go back and look for him.”

“Call him and ask him to come,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Coldness flashed across Liu Bu’s face. He immediately nodded and said, “Okay, I’ll call him right now!”

After saying that, he grabbed his phone and crawled to the side. He dialed the number in anguish.

“Mr. Qin, I’m afraid Liu Bu’s father won’t let us off easily,” Yao Qing reminded him.

Qin Yu sat on the sofa and said indifferently, “It’s alright. Let him come.”

Ten minutes later, a middle-aged man rushed to the villa.

As expected, he had a few bodyguards with him.

Just as Yao Qing was about to make a move, Liu Bu’s father slapped Liu Bu in the face!

“You only know how to cause trouble. How did I give birth to such a good-for-nothing like you?!” He cursed.

Then, he hurriedly walked to Qin Yu, cupped his hands and said, “Mr. Qin, I’m really sorry. I hadn’t disciplined him properly. I hope you can forgive us.”

This surprised Qin Yu a little.

As the saying went, one should never hit a smiling face. Qin Yu immediately flicked his finger, and a pill fell into Liu Bu’s hand.

“Go back and rub this pill on your leg. There’s still hope for your leg,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

Hearing this, Liu Bu’s father was immediately overjoyed and hurriedly said, “Thank you, Mr. Qin!”

“Alright, stop talking nonsense. I want to buy this villa.” Qin Yu took out the black card given by Wei Jiang.

The moment he saw the black card, Liu Bu’s father’s expression changed slightly.

He hurriedly waved his hand and said, “Mr. Qin, since you have cured my son’s leg, this villa is yours!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Mine?” Qin Yu was even more baffled.

He was clearly the one who broke Liu Bu’s leg, so how come Liu Bu’s father was so polite?

“Mr. Qin, perhaps the black card in your hand has played a role,” Yao Qing whispered in his ear.

Qin Yu suddenly came to a realization. He put away the black card and nodded. “Thank you very much. I’ll remember your kindness.”

“Thank you, Mr. Qin!” Liu Bu’s father hurriedly cupped his hands.

Then, he walked to Liu Bu and scolded, “Useless thing, crawl out yourself!”

The villa finally quieted down.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and felt the rich spiritual energy from the surroundings.

“It’s really a good place,” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

Then, he asked Yao Qing to open the box he brought with him.

Inside the box were three herbs. A strong scent of herbs instantly filled the entire villa.

Qin Yu took a deep breath. He was a little excited.

These three herbs were enough to support him in advancing to the Foundation Establishment Stage!

Qin Yu couldn’t wait to find out how powerful the Foundation Establishment Stage was!

“As the saying goes, patience is key. Although I used the pill, it only took me a month,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

In an environment where spiritual energy was scarce, Qin Yu’s speed was mind blowing.

“Yao Qing, I’ll have to trouble you for the next few days.” Qin Yu looked at Yao Qing and said.

Yao Qing quickly said, “Mr. Qin, you’re too courteous.”

Then, Qin Yu didn’t waste any more time. He took out these few herbs and prepared to refine the Qi Gathering Pill.

The later one cultivated, the more Qi Gathering Pills one needed.

If Qin Yu wanted to advance to the next stage, he would probably need at least two Qi Gathering Pills.

“These three herbs can bring me at least a dozen Qi Gathering Pills,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Then, he took out the relevant tools and began to refine the Qi Gathering Pill.

At this moment, the Liu family was already ready to make a move.

“Young Master, there’s news that Yan Ruoxue has returned to Jingdu,” Liu Shihui’s secretary said by his ear.

Liu Shihui took a deep breath, and a hint of viciousness flashed across his eyes.

“Although she has left Jiangcheng, no one knows whether she will still continue to help Qin Yu,” Liu Shihui said with a frown.

“Why don’t we... ask for instructions first?” The secretary suggested.

Liu Shihui thought for a moment, then shook his head and said, “No, it’s best if the Yan family doesn’t know about this.”

The Chinese knotweed was too tempting for Liu Shihui. Even if it was a risk, he still wanted to try it!

Liu Shihui had seen Qin Yu’s skills with his own eyes. For an ordinary person, it indeed wasn’t bad.

But for Liu Shihui, it wasn’t worth mentioning.

Because... Liu Shihui was extremely famous in the martial arts world! He was known as a genius!

In just three years, he had advanced to the level of an Inner Strength Master Hands!

His strength was even above that old servant’s!

“When the time comes, we will act according to the circumstances,” Liu Shihui said coldly.

“Yes, Young Master.” The secretary quickly nodded and said.

That day, the Liu family prepared a car and rushed to Jiangcheng.

At this time, Qin Yu’s pill was about to be ready.

Qin Yu stood to the side and used spiritual energy to control the heat.

Qin Yu’s experience in refining pills had already allowed him to become much more skilled.

“Bang!”

At this moment, a loud sound came from the room!

The entire furnace exploded in an instant!

A strong herbal aroma assailed his nostrils!

Qin Yu hurriedly ran over and looked down. He saw several pills lying quietly in the ruins!

Qin Yu picked up the pill and counted carefully.

“Twenty-eight pills! It’s far beyond my imagination!” Qin Yu shouted in surprise.
