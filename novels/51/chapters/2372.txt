2373 Seizing the Power of the Path of Heaven

The instant the dark lightning struck down, Qin Yu gritted his teeth and no longer hesitated.

The dark lightning struck the Sumeru ring, and the entire ring instantly turned into a dark lightning sea. The terrifying energy shattered the ring, and countless cracks appeared in the air as if it would collapse at any moment. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The rules inside became chaotic, and the initially sunny world instantly looked like the end of the world. Lightning flashed, thunder roared, and cold winds blew.

“I’m scared!”

Xiaoru and Little Fatty screamed. They hid behind Jue Wu, and each grabbed one of her legs, hugging her tightly.

“It’s okay, it’s okay. I’ll protect you guys.”

Jue Wu squatted down and hugged the two little kids, pulling them into her arms.

In the blink of an eye, the monster race’s Path of Heaven had entered the Sumeru ring. The Sumeru ring once again appeared on Qin Yu’s finger, and with a flash of his body, he brought the Sumeru ring and traveled 10,000 meters away.

Qin Yu’s speed was tremendously fast, and he could now travel tens of thousands of meters within a divine thought.

Dark clouds rolled in the sky, and a thunderous bolt of lightning suddenly erupted within the clouds.

The Path of Heaven seemed to have sensed the change. It was the power it had bestowed on the monster race but was suddenly snatched away by another space. The Path of Heaven also let out an angry roar of thunder.

The monster race general under the dark lightning let out a heaven-shaking roar. His angry voice even shook the space.

He raised his halberd high and gathered all the strength, to the utmost, in his hand.

That strength exceeded the limits of the monster race’s Path of Heaven, but the Path of Heaven did not descend a heavenly punishment.

A terrifying force crossed the space and locked onto Qin Yu. A long halberd was thrown out from the monster race general’s hand with a destructive force.

The halberd instantly turned into a black bolt of lightning, and a shocking sound of thunder rang out behind it.

After that, it pierced through space and arrived in an instant.

There was no way to dodge at this speed.

The space around the halberd completely shattered, turning into an extreme black hole.

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. Before this power had even arrived, he already felt suffocating as if the surrounding air had been completely absorbed by the halberd.

Could it be that because he had broken the rules of the ritual, this monster race general could unleash an attack that surpassed the limits of the Path of Heaven?

He narrowed his eyes slightly, and his power of divine sense surged.

The Spiritualization Technique instantly formed thousands of massive shields before the halberd. However, in the next moment, the halberd suddenly disappeared.

“Go to hell!”

The monster race general revealed a sinister smile.

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. His hand instantly formed several hand seals, and the muscles in his body emitted a cracking sound before they suddenly expanded.

The cosmic form. It was the first time he used the cosmic form after his Glazed Holy Body was formed.

Each muscle carrying an iridescent green light was gently trembling, signifying an incredibly terrifying physical strength.

In the blink of an eye, the halberd struck his chest.

Qin Yu only felt an unrivaled force spread throughout his entire body.

He grabbed the halberd with both hands almost simultaneously, using all the strength in his body.

He firmly held the halberd, and a surging force suddenly exploded. His entire body was sent flying like a stream of flowing light.

Along the way, his body broke through countless rocks, forming an endless ravine. After a long time, then only the massive force slowly disappeared.

The monster race general arrived at the place of the explosion. Wherever his feet landed, the ground was shattered by the massive force. However, there was no longer anyone there.

His scarlet eyes scanned the entire space, but he found no clues.

“Kill!”

He raised his halberd high, and his angry voice echoed throughout the space.

All the monster race warriors kneeled one after another as if the general’s anger made them tremble.

At this moment, Qin Yu had crossed hundreds of spaces. His hands trembled uncontrollably in the Sumeru ring, and a huge bloody hole appeared in his chest.

The skin on his body had cracked, and blood was oozing out, making him look like a bloody man.

The power of this halberd directly locked onto him across space.

He could not understand this technique. Even though he had transcended space, he could still sense it.

This halberd seemed to use his body as a coordinate. It suddenly disappeared and then appeared again. There was no way to avoid it.

Fortunately, he had used his cosmic form at the last moment to forcefully block this halberd with the strength of his flesh and soul. Otherwise, this attack might have directly destroyed his body.

His hands pushed to the left and right, and the spatial rules continued to display in his hands. After that, he used spells to attack the various collapsed places, stabilizing the locations on the verge of collapse.

Then, with a divine thought, several powerful formations were set up.

“Southern Ming Fiery Formation!”

“Dual-principle Dust Formation!”

“Celestial Star Formation!”

The three enormous formations spread out around the qi of the Path of Heaven and suppressed it.

The qi of the Path of Heaven roared angrily. The terrifying energy hit the formation like a spear, and the entire Dumeru ring shook violently like an earthquake.

Qin Yu stabilized the Sumeru ring with the spatial rules with all his might. A large amount of Sumeru qi was also constantly repairing the broken space.

If he had not used the Sumeru qi to stabilize the space and without a deep understanding of space after sailing in the Sea of Space, he would probably have been unable to trap this ball of monster race’s qi of Path of Heaven.

“You better f*cking behave yourself!

Chang Mang charged into the demonic qi and bombarded it with a barrage of attacks.

However, his attacks were like a bull sinking into the sea. It had no effect at all.

Instead, the demonic qi drilled into his body, causing him to roll on the ground.

“Chang Mang! Are you alright?”

Qin Yu shouted anxiously.

His muscles kept spasming and tearing apart, and new muscles grew out.

“I’m fine. This demonic qi seems to be able to temper the body. I’ll try again!”

Chang Mang’s body absorbed a portion of the demonic qi, and all of the muscles on his body fell onto the ground.

The new muscles grew out once more, and even his ears could hear the faint sound of electricity. A beast-like internal qi emanated from Chang Mang’s body.

Suddenly, Chang Mang’s face revealed a pained expression as seven or eight thumb-sized bone spurs suddenly protruded from his back.
