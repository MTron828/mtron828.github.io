Chapter 1284: Chapter 1,284, Sacred Artifact! 

Qin Yu didn’t know how to explain it either, but before he lost his spiritual power, he had indeed not been able to step into the mighty realm.

It wasn’t just Qin Yu, no one in the entire earth had stepped into the mighty realm in this world.

“Alright, if you don’t want to say it, then don’t say it. Take care of your injuries.”Guan Zhuang patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said.

Then, Guan Zhuang walked out.

In another room.

Jin Lun’s face was gloomy. In front of him, there was a large group of underlings surrounding him.

“Big Brother, this kid’s appearance will definitely threaten you. Why don’t we take advantage of his injury and kill him!”Someone suggested.

However, Jin Lun said coldly, “We can’t. The team leader and Jing Bai will definitely protect him. Moreover, if we take advantage of him, we won’t need to stay here in the future.”

“Then what should we do? Should we just let him go?”

Jin Lun didn’t say a word. He had countless plans in his mind. Any one of them could take Qin Yu’s life.

However, plans often couldn’t keep up with changes. In the morning of the next day, a few well-dressed people suddenly arrived.

These people were wearing long robes with a huge cloud on top.

They were none other than Ling Yun from the Heavenly Cloud sect! That Genius Youth!

Without even lifting his head, Jing Bai said, “Are you going to issue an order? Fill in the form.”

Ling Yun looked at Jing Bai coldly and said, “I’m here to look for someone.”

“Look for someone?”Jing Bai frowned slightly. He put down the work in his hands and looked up at Ling Yun.

At this moment, Zhong Wu suddenly ran out from the side.

He ran in front of Ling Yun quickly and said with a smile, “My lords from the Heavenly Cloud Sect, you are here to look for Qin Yu, right?”

Ling Yun’s eyes lit up instantly as he said coldly, “Qin Yu is really here?”

“Yes, don’t you all know?”Zhong Wu was overjoyed! It seemed like his guess was right. This Qin Yu was indeed from the Heavenly Cloud sect!

“Cut the crap and bring us to him quickly,”an almighty beside Ling Yun said coldly.

Zhong wu hurriedly said, “No problem, I’ll bring you to him right away.”

After saying that, Zhong Wu led the way and walked towards Qin Yu’s room.

On the way, Zhong Wu patted his chest and said, “I’m friends with Qin Yu. I’ve been taking care of him all this time!”

“Oh? You’re friends with him?”Ling Yun said with a faint smile.

Zhong wu said proudly, “Of course. I even lent him more than a million!”

Ling Yun couldn’t help but feel murderous, but he wasn’t in a hurry to make a move.

“This is it!”Zhong Wu pointed at Qin Yu’s room.

He walked forward quickly and pushed Qin Yu’s room open.

“Qin Yu, your sect is here to look for you!”Zhong Wu said excitedly.

At this moment, Guan Zhuang was feeding Qin Yu Medicine. When he heard this, Guan Zhuang couldn’t help but ask curiously, “Sect? What sect?”

Before Zhong Wu could say anything, Ling Yun had brought a few people in.

When he saw these people, Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically!

“You’re here so soon?”Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said softly.

“Qin Yu, you sure know how to hide,”Ling Yun sneered.

Qin Yu sat up from the bed and said calmly, “You’re the genius from the Heavenly Cloud Sect?”

“Oh? You’ve heard of Me?”Ling Yun was slightly surprised.

“I’ve heard of you. I heard that you’re not old, but you’re vicious and cruel,”Qin Yu said plainly.

“Thank you for the compliment,”Ling Yun said with a cold smile.

Even though he was only seventeen years old, he was extremely experienced in speaking and handling matters. He didn’t look like a teenager at all.

“Are you coming back with us, or do you want me to cripple you before bringing you back?”Ling Yun asked.

Qin Yu stood up slowly and said with a cold smile, “That depends on how capable you are.”

Zhong Wu, who was watching from the side, was dumbfounded. He rubbed his eyes and asked in puzzlement, “This Qin Yu... isn’t a member of your sect?”

“A member of our sect? He is our enemy,”the almighty beside Ling Yun snorted coldly.

Zhong Wu’s expression changed drastically! In that instant, countless thoughts flashed through his mind.

“Qin Yu, you f * cking tricked me! Quickly return the money to me!”Zhong Wu cursed.

Qin Yu sneered. “When did I trick you?”

“You F * cking pretended to be a member of the Heavenly Cloud Sect!”Zhong wu said through gritted teeth. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“When did I F * cking say that I’m a member of the Heavenly Cloud Sect? Wasn’t that all in your head?”Qin Yu scoffed.

Ling Yun glanced at Zhong Wu and said sarcastically, “Didn’t you say that you and Qin Yu are friends?”

Zhong wu hurriedly waved his hand. “Who’s friends with him? I thought that he was a member of the Heavenly Cloud Sect. That’s why I wanted to make friends with him. I didn’t expect him to be your enemy.”

Ling Yun couldn’t be bothered with Zhong Wu anymore. He waved his hand and said, “Break Qin Yu’s limbs and bring him back.”

“Yes.”

The three mighty figures walked forward, emitting an extremely terrifying pressure.

“Stop!”

At this moment, the team leader suddenly brought everyone over.

He walked quickly to Qin Yu and looked at Ling Yun. He cupped his hands and said, “Young Master Ling, How Do You Do?”

Ling Yun looked at the team leader coldly. “Who are you?”

“I’m the team leader of the Hunter organization. If there’s anything you want to talk to me about,”the team leader said with a smile.

Ling Yun snorted lightly. “This Qin Yu has offended my Tianyun sect. I want to bring him back now.”

“I’m afraid that won’t do.”The team leader shook his head with a smile. “Our Hunter organization has never betrayed anyone. How about this, Young Master Ling, tell me what Qin Yu has done wrong, and I’ll punish him.”

Ling Yun’s expression turned cold as he said, “You dare to interfere in the matters of My Tianyun Sect?”

The team leader smiled faintly. “Young Master Ling, Our Hunter organization has always followed this rule. The rules can’t be broken.”

Ling Yun’s body emitted a strong killing intent as he said coldly, “Aren’t you afraid that I’ll kill you?”

“Young Master Ling, I’m afraid it won’t be that simple if you want to kill me,”the team leader said with a smile.

As he spoke, a white bone scepter appeared in his hand. The scepter emitted a faint holy aura.

This holy aura immediately caused people to be fearful!

Ling Yun’s brows also furrowed at this moment.

“That broken white bone is used as a holy weapon to scare me? Do you think I’m afraid?”Ling Yun said coldly.

“Whether it’s a holy weapon or not, Young Master Ling, why don’t you give it a try?”The team leader’s tone was neither servile nor overbearing.

Ling Yun’s expression was somewhat ugly. Facing a saint weapon, he really didn’t have the courage to give it a try.

“No one has ever dared to go against the wishes of my heavenly cloud sect. So what if you have a saint weapon in your hand? Do you think my Heavenly Cloud sect will be afraid of You?”Ling Yun said coldly.
