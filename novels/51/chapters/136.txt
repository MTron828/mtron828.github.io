A faint layer of light lingered around Qin Yu’s body. The light on Tao Shan’s body began to disappear, and his muscles slowly returned to normal.

Qin Yu slowly walked in front of Tao Shan. He looked at Tao Shan coldly and said, “You train in both Inner Strength and Cross-training, but what I train in is different from you. What I train in is spiritual power.”

“Spiritual power?” Tao Shan seemed to have heard this term for the first time.

Qin Yu said slowly, “Don’t ask anymore. You should rest.”

After saying that, Qin Yu patted Tao Shan’s body gently.

His huge body suddenly exploded with a loud bang!

“Get the f * ck up!” Liu Yi, who wasn’t far away, roared furiously.

“You must be faking it. You must be faking it!” Liu Yi gritted his teeth. He was obviously anxious.

Liu Shihui, who was beside him, had an extremely ugly expression and was on the verge of a mental breakdown.

All along, he had considered himself a genius, but in just a few short days, he realized that Qin Yu’s strength had far exceeded his imagination!

“Even Tao Shan was defeated. How is this possible?!” Liu Shihui’s expression was extremely ugly.

He couldn’t figure out how Qin Yu’s strength had suddenly increased so much in just a few days?

Qin Yu didn’t kill Tao Shan because he knew very clearly that this matter had nothing to do with Tao Shan.

Following that, Qin Yu slowly walked in front of Liu Yi.

“Kneel down and apologize.” Qin Yu’s tone was unyielding.

Liu Yi gritted his teeth. He glared at Qin Yu and shouted, “Qin Yu, so what if you win against Tao Shan?! This is a society ruled by law. Do you dare to kill me? If you kill me, you will also be sentenced to death! Hahaha!”

Just as Liu Yi said, no one in this era could go against the authorities.

However, Qin Yu was unfazed. He sneered and said, “Do you think there is only one way to kill people?”

After saying that, Qin Yu flicked his finger, and a wisp of spiritual fire instantly landed on Wu Hongchang’s body!

“Poof!”

The moment the spiritual fire touched Wu Hongchang’s body, it turned into ashes! Not even a trace was left behind!

“If I kill you, who will be able to find out?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said.

Liu Yi’s face instantly turned ashen, and he was extremely terrified!

He couldn’t figure out how Qin Yu, who came from Jiangcheng, could force the entire Liu family to bow down to him?

A wisp of spiritual fire shot out from Qin Yu’s finger again.

He sat on the sofa and said indifferently, “I’m only going to count to three. If you haven’t knelt down and apologized, I won’t show mercy.”

After saying that, Qin Yu closed his eyes and began to count.

Liu Yi’s expression was extremely ugly. Looking at the flames dancing on Qin Yu’s fingers, he became even more terrified.

“Two...”

At this time, Qin Yu had already counted to the last number.

Just as Qin Yu was about to shout “three,” Liu Yi suddenly knelt on the ground with a plop!

He gritted his teeth and said in misery, “Qin Yu, I was wrong... I shouldn’t have offended you. I hope you can spare my life...”

“Dad!” Liu Shihui clenched his fists tightly. His face was filled with defiance. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

A few days ago, Qin Yu was just a nobody. However, in just a few days, Qin Yu had the ability to go against the entire Liu family!

At this moment, Liu Yi also began to understand why so many large families insisted on hiring top-notch martial artists even if they had to spend a huge sum of money!

“What about you?” Qin Yu glanced at Liu Shihui.

Liu Shihui gritted his teeth and said, “Qin Yu, don’t even think about it!”

“Oh really?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows. He looked at Liu Yi coldly and suddenly shouted, “Kneel down!”

These two words seemed to have the force of a thousand tons!

Liu Shihui instantly felt his legs go soft, and with a plop, he knelt on the ground!

He wanted to struggle, but he found that he couldn’t break free at all!

“How is this possible...” Liu Shihui’s ego was completely bruised!

Just two words from Qin Yu were enough to suppress him. This meant that Qin Yu’s strength had far exceeded his imagination!

Qin Yu snorted coldly. He slowly stood up, looked coldly at Liu Yi, and said, “This is the last time. If you guys provoke me again, I guarantee that the entire Liu family will disappear.”

Liu Yi lowered his head and didn’t say a word.

Liu Shihui looked completely dejected.

“Qin... Qin Yu.” At this moment, Sun Fu, who had been hiding in the corner, suddenly spoke.

He said with an embarrassed smile, “Qin Yu, I have offended you just now. You... you must not lower yourself to my level...”

Sun Fu had already been scared to death. He was just an ordinary person, so how could he have ever seen such a scene before?! Everything that happened in front of him had completely overturned his worldview!

More importantly, in his heart, the Liu family had always been out of his league but now, they were kneeling in front of Qin Yu and admitting their mistakes!

Qin Yu glanced at him and sneered. “Do you think I would stoop to your level?”

Sun Fu was stunned. He couldn’t care about anything else anymore and hurriedly nodded. “Yes, yes, you’re right. Just treat me as an old fart...”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything, but he couldn’t help but bemoan it inside.

Sun Fu and Sun Yumei were indeed blood-related siblings. They were really alike.

Qin Yu didn’t stay any longer and quickly left the Liu family’s home.

The next day, Qin Yu and Yao Qing prepared to return to Jiangcheng.

The two of them packed their luggage and prepared to leave.

At this time, Lu Shuming’s car suddenly entered.

He said with some surprise, “Mr. Qin, I really didn’t expect the Liu family to actually admit defeat!”

After saying that, Lu Shuming gave Qin Yu a thumbs up.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said with some surprise, “How did you know?”

Lu Shuming said with an embarrassed smile, “Since I’m an opponent of the Liu family, I naturally have to pay attention to their every move. Only by knowing yourself and the enemy can you win!”

Qin Yu nodded and didn’t say anything more.

“The Liu family has fallen. No one in South City can stop you now. As long as I spread the word, you will definitely be known by everyone in South City! By that time, you can rule over an area!” Lu Shuming said excitedly.

Qin Yu glanced at him and shook his head. “There’s no need.”

Lu Shuming was stunned and said somewhat confusedly, “Mr. Qin, this is a good opportunity to establish your authority!”

Qin Yu shook his head and slowly said, “My ambitions don’t lie here.”

“Your ambitions don’t lie here?” Lu Shuming was even more confused.

Qin Yu looked to the north and slowly said, “My goal is to establish myself in Jingdu.”

To Qin Yu, everything he had done was so that he could venture into Jingdu as soon as possible and go to the Yan family to marry Yan Ruoxue.

Lu Shuming was speechless and didn’t know what to say.

...

In a huge garden in Jingdu.

This place was two thousand square meters, and the manor alone was over a thousand square meters.

In Jingdu, where every inch of land was extremely expensive, to occupy such a large area was enough to show that the owner was extremely affluent.

And this place belonged to the Yan family.

At this moment, in the huge villa, a young girl was holding a brush and drawing when the door suddenly opened. The young girl heard the sound and hurriedly closed the notebook.

“Ruoxue, what are you hiding?” The person who spoke was a kind-looking old man.

The old man’s face was full of wrinkles. The gaze he showed Yan Ruoxue was filled with doting love.

“Grandpa, why did you come in without knocking?” Yan Ruoxue pouted and said unhappily.

The old man glanced at Yan Ruoxue’s notebook and laughed. “If I’m not mistaken, you must be writing his name, right?”
