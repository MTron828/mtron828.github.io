It opened its mouth wide and spat out a cloud of mist from its two sharp venomous fangs.

A green poison enveloped everyone.

In an instant, the mist was like wriggling worms.

They rushed at all the human beings at lightning speed, drilling into their eyes, pores, skin, and other places.

“Be careful. My holy energy has been corroded. I can’t protect myself from these poisons.”

The voice of the person who spoke stopped abruptly. Two streams of blood flowed from his pupils.

All his internal organs and bones had melted by the time his body fell to the ground, leaving only a piece of human skin.

“Hahaha! How can you lowly humans resist my poison?”

The head let out a shrill laugh.

As it swam, it suddenly entered the void and dodged all the attacks chasing it.

Nine Heavens Holy Sword!

A golden holy sword smashed down from the sky.

The king-level poisonous snake was nailed to the ground and the entire ground shook.

The ground sank nearly a hundred meters under this attack.

Countless cracks on the ground extended for more than ten thousand meters.

Qin Yu’s Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze slowly closed.

The power of the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze was linked to his divine sense. At this moment, his divine soul was no longer inferior to the strength of the Holy Consciousness Realm.

With this strike, the power of the Nine Heavens Holy Sword was nearly a hundred times greater than before.

“Innate divine ability?”

Before Qin Yu had a chance to recover, two golden claws had already landed in front of him. His head was going to be crunched.

Qin Yu felt as if the space in front of him was frozen.

It was as if the claw had controlled the surrounding internal qi.

Die!

A high-pressure internal qi suddenly erupted. Countless cracks appeared on his body.

Then, his entire body exploded.

“I’m sorry, little brother!”

Leng Yuanxun trembled in pain.

He could not leave although he was filled with anger.

He had an even more important task at the moment. He had to stay by Jiang Shengling’s side until he entered the Eight Desolates Beast Domain.

The righteous qi that condensed from the entire Saint World and the lower realm had to be emitted.

At this moment, Jiang Shengling was like a god in the sky. The space within a hundred meters of him had turned into a black hole.

The space of the Saint World could no longer bear his power.

That was the violent power of the human race’s righteous cries. Even the heavens and earth could not withstand it.

However, his hand that was holding the ancient book was trembling visibly. The righteous qi river could not be released if there was any external interference.

Tentacles extended from Qin Yu’s flesh and blood. In the next moment, countless tentacles joined together.

Qin Yu’s body recovered once again and a huge scythe appeared in his hand.

The golden roc had already charged into the crowd. When it sensed the familiar internal qi, it was shocked. It did not know how this human could recover directly.

Ling Bo!

Qin Yu rushed into a group of demonic beasts and poured all his Saint Power into the scythe in his hand.

Dance of Death!

The arc of death slashed out. All the magical beasts within a thousand meters were cut into pieces.

With this attack, nearly a hundred powerful demonic beasts were directly dismembered.

There were even six king-tier magical beasts.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and kept Sir Dagger.

At this moment, an exhausted feeling kept emerging.

The Investiture of Gods on his chest was getting hotter and hotter. The giant was about to arrive.

Qin Yu sighed and looked at the few humans.

A few powerful kings entered the crowd. The humans were simply unable to stop them.

After a few waves of attacks, almost all the humans had been scattered.

Before Qin Yu could adjust his breathing, a few more attacks bombarded his body and scattered him again.

In just a moment, his body recovered once again.

Qin Yu roared. At the last moment, he had to use all his strength.

He rushed into the crowd of demonic beasts and used his physical strength to tear a bloody path.

One Sword One World!

Leng Yuanxun held a sword and a violent killing intent soared into the sky.

The king-level golden lion in front of him was instantly cut in half.

The remaining Spiritual Energy Sword cut through space and forcefully slashed out a wide path nearly a thousand meters long.

In the blink of an eye, a large number of magical beasts blocked him again.

“Sword of Immortality?”

Fatty Situ said in shock from afar. The Sword of Immortality had fallen into Leng Yuanxun’s hands. The Situ family had been searching for the four swords, but there had been no clues. It turned out that someone had already obtained it.

Suddenly, an extremely murderous Spiritual Energy Sword blasted out again.

Sword of Immortal-killing.

Sword of Immortal-captus.

Sword of Immortal-vanquishing.

The four swords of the Primorial Chaos gathered together. The four swords focused on killing.

As they bombarded one after another, not a single magical beast could get close.

Leng Yuanxun walked slowly in front, while Jiang Shengling followed behind with an ancient book in his hand.

It was a strange and sad scene.

Leng Yuanxun’s face began to turn pale. He didn’t know how many flashes of Spiritual Energy Sword he had already unleashed.

In the end, he seemed to be relying on his instincts to swing the four swords.

The demonic beasts were still coming in endlessly. Their goal was to stop them from entering the Eight Desolates Beast Domain at all costs.

“Old friend, let me walk in front of you.”

The Four Swords of Immortality suddenly shot into the sky. Countless sword lights poured down from the sword bodies.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The clouds in the sky suddenly surged. A huge array appeared in the middle.

Sacrifice to the array!

Leng Yuanxun rushed into the formation in the clouds. The Spiritual Energy Sword tore his body apart.

His flesh and blood turned into pure energy and entered the formation.

The four giant swords emitted dazzling sword aurora.

Raindrops began to fall.

When the rain fell to the magical beasts, only then did they realize that every drop of rain was filled with the Spiritual Energy Sword full of killing intent.

Countless magical beasts were pierced through. Dense bloody holes appeared on their bodies.

“So the Sword of Immortality is in Leng Yuanxun’s hands. But even so, it’s not enough.”

Liu Bai stood on his immortal sword and watched this scene from the edge of the Eight Desolates Beast Domain.

“Little Uncle, why must Jiang Shengling launch this attack here?”

Ling Xue spat out a mouthful of blood. She had been seriously injured in the battle just now.

Her body was restrained by Liu Bai now. She did not have the chance to help at all.

She could only ask the question in her heart.

With Jiang Shengling and Leng Yuanxun’s talents, why did they have to die here?

“It’s very simple. Jiang Shengling is about to die. The righteous qi can allow him to gather the justice qi of the human race in the world, but he also has to bear the dark power at the same time. His life will end when black and white are reversed, so he has no choice but to strike here.”

Liu Bai said softly.

In the Eight Desolates Beast Domain, the wormhole emitted a ray of multicolored light.

The multicolored light covered one of the magic beasts that was sitting cross-legged. Almost at the same time, its body underwent a huge change.
