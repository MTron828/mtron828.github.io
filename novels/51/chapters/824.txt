Chapter 825: Rumors of the Guardian and the Masked Woman

Qin Yu picked up the book.

There were only a few simple words written on the book: Modern History of Martial Arts.

And this book was printed, which was enough to prove that this book was written by future generations.

The whole book wasn’t thick, only a few dozen pages.

Compared to the other three books, this book appeared very thin.

“It seems that the history of martial arts was recorded in modern times.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but shake his head.

He didn’t waste any more time and opened the first page.

The first thing that came into view was the name of the author.

The author’s name was Piedmont. Other than that, there was no other information.

Qin Yu took the book and found a corner to sit down. Then, he began to read it carefully.

Although the content of this book wasn’t much, it was rather detailed.

From the development of 200 years ago to 20 years ago, all kinds of events, big and small, were included.

Qin Yu spent a whole three hours, but he still didn’t see anything related to his father.

“Strange.” Qin Yu frowned.

According to the description of Old Mister Yan and Gu Taichu, his father should be a top expert. After all, he had left a heavy mark in the recent history of martial arts.

But now, Qin Yu discovered that there was nothing about his father. There wasn’t even a single person with the surname Qin.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment before he continued to read.

It was already late at night. The many young masters of the aristocratic families on the first floor had already gone to bed.

Yet, Qin Yu was still reading with great interest.

At this moment, Qin Yu saw an important piece of information:

About a hundred years ago, there were still Martial Saints in this world.

At that time, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association had already taken shape.

They had long since taken control of most of the Martial Saints in this world. It could be said that they had taken control of the entire martial arts world.

However, Martial Saints had a great influence on this world. A Martial Saint was even enough to influence the national structure at that time!

Since the Jingdu Martial Arts Association had taken control of such a powerful force, it was naturally a disaster.

This situation continued until seventy years ago.

The Jingdu Martial Arts Association also grew stronger and more ambitious.

At this critical moment, a man who claimed to be a Guardian killed more than thirty Martial Saints of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association in one breath!

When he saw this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but gasp.

Killed more than thirty Martial Saints in one breath? What kind of formidable power was this?!

“This Guardian... who is he? And what is he guarding?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel somewhat puzzled.

Qin Yu continued to read. There were very few records of the Guardian in the book. However, from the descriptions between the lines, one could tell that this Guardian’s strength was far above that of a Martial Saint!

“With a raise of his hand, the earth became dark. None of the ten Martial Saints were spared.”

“In three consecutive days, thirty Martial Saints were killed.”

These lines of words were enough to prove that the Guardian was far more powerful than a Martial Saint.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but ask in a deep voice, “Could it be because of the existence of this Guardian that the Martial Saint hid in the Mystic Realm?”

However, this was still a little strange.

There were no longer any Martial Sainst in this world. Since then, not a single Martial Saint had appeared.

If the Guardian could kill a living Martial Saint, why would he need to restrict people from stepping into the Martial Saint realm?

“Could it be that a Guardian could forcefully restrict a Martial Saint’s realm below the Martial Saint realm?” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

This was almost impossible.

If that was the case, then a Guardian would no longer be a human and would most likely become a part of the Heavenly Dao.

“There might be other reasons,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Qin Yu lowered his head and continued to look down.

Since then, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association suffered a crushing blow, and there was no longer any Martial Saints in the entire association.

But even so, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association was still the most powerful organization in the martial arts world.

Along with the development of technology, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association also began to strive to transform, desperately trying to label itself as an official member of the martial arts world.

In the following decades, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association produced dozens of Martial Marquises!

Among them, there were even people who had stepped into the half-step Martial Saint realm. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“After the half-step Martial Saint realm, they used heavenly materials and earthly treasures to support them, but they were still unable to step into the Martial Saint realm. It was difficult for them to advance even a little bit.”

“The association searched everywhere for the reason, but there was still no trace of it.”

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but shake his head and say, “It seems that even the Jingdu Martial Arts Association couldn’t find the reason.”

Obviously, they had tried to let people enter the Martial Saint realm, but unfortunately, they had failed.

“After that, they tried to invite them to enter the Mystic Realm to cultivate, but they were still unable to enter the Martial Saint realm.” When he looked back, another paragraph of words attracted Qin Yu’s attention.

This caused Qin Yu to feel shocked.

“In other words... even after entering the Mystic Realm to cultivate, a half-step Martial Saint was still unable to enter the Martial Saint realm?!” Qin Yu’s face was full of surprise.

This meant that even Gu Xinghe and the others couldn’t enter the Martial Saint realm?!

And Gu Zizhen and the other existing Martial Saints were all figures from a hundred years ago? They had already entered the Martial Saint realm a hundred years ago?

“What is the reason for this?!” Qin Yu was even more shocked.

If this was the case, this wasn’t caused by the exhaustion of spiritual energy.

This was because there was no lack of spiritual energy in the Mystic Realm.

“No wonder people say that Martial Marquises are the strongest people in the world,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Then, Qin Yu read through the entire book.

Other than these contents, Qin Yu wasn’t interested in the rest of the content.

This was because Qin Yu couldn’t understand the records of many people and deeds.

Qin Yu returned the book.

He touched his chin and said in a low voice, “This means that no one in this era can step into the Martial Saint realm.”

“And the Martial Saint under the control of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association doesn’t dare to appear because of the existence of the Guardians.”

Qin Yu recalled what the Pavilion Master had said.

She said that he would be the one to break this deadlock.

“If I really stepped into the Martial Saint realm, then I would be the only one to step into the Martial Saint realm in the past hundred years,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

At this moment, the sky had gradually brightened up.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to waste any time. He kept this book and continued to read the remaining three books, preparing to find information about the masked woman.

According to the records of the man with the mustache, this masked woman had appeared ten thousand years ago.

Therefore, Qin Yu directly picked up the earliest book.

Unfortunately, the words recorded in this book were extremely weird, Qin Yu couldn’t understand a single one of them.

Helpless, Qin Yu had no choice but to put down the book and choose the book with the history of martial arts from five thousand years ago.

Although the words in this book were equally complicated, it was fortunate that Qin Yu had learned ancient characters when he was in university, so he could barely understand it.

He slowly opened the book and flipped through it at an extremely fast speed, trying to find records related to the masked woman.

About an hour later, Qin Yu finally saw the records related to the masked woman.

“Peerless looks; mask covering her face, kills people without batting an eye.”

A line of words entered Qin Yu’s eyes.
