Chapter 25: I’ll Get Lei Hu To Beat You Up Again Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

When he looked at the two women, Qin Yu suddenly felt a gush of revulsion.

”Geez Qin Yu, you’re living in such a nice house now,” Sun Yumei said as she surveyed her surroundings.

Qin Yu looked at Sun Yumei with cold eyes and said, “What do you want?”

”Look at you. I can’t come to see you if I don’t have a purpose in mind?” Sun Yumei replied cheerfully.

The contrast in attitude before and after she found out about the Yan family’s connection with Qin Yu made him feel increasingly disgusted.

Lei Hu stood aside. He looked awkward as he could not find the right time to interject.

Qin Yu turned around and walked inside the room.

Sun Yumei saw this and gave Su Yan a quick look.

Although Su Yan was reluctant, she followed him into the room.

As soon as they entered the living room, Sun Yumei exclaimed, “This house is so lavish. It’s much better than ours!”

Qin Yu grunted coldly and did not say anything.

”Qin Yu, you see, we have lived together for three years. Three years of bonding can’t be discarded so easily.” Sun Yumei tried to tap on Qin Yu’s emotional side. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

”Because of Su family’s education, you are able to achieve great success now, isn’t that so?” Sun Yumei said shamelessly.

When Qin Yu heard that he could not refrain from snickering and said, “The Su family’s education? What did you teach me? Laundry and cooking? Or to be scolded and beaten?”

Sun Yumei’s face flushed with embarrassment as she laughed and said, “Oh, that’s all in the past! Even if you and Su Yan are divorced, I will always treat you like family!”

After that, Sun Yumei shouted to Su Yan, “Go get Qin Yu a glass of water!”

Su Yan came forward coyly. When she poured water for Qin Yu, she deliberately slipped into Qin Yu’s arms.

Luckily, Qin Yu reacted swiftly and hastily dodged to the side.

Su Yan, who was supposed to fall into Qin Yu’s arms, fell heavily to the ground instead.

”Ouch...” Su Yan covered her arm with a pained look on her face.

After that, she got up from the ground and looked at Qin Yu angrily. She was about to throw a fit.

Sun Yumei, however, hurriedly stopped her before she could do so.

Sun Yumei pulled Qin Yu aside and said with a wink, “Qin Yu, I know you’re upset after what happened, and I don’t know how to make it up to you.”

”If you wish, you and Su Yan can also do the same thing in the future!” Sun Yumei said with a wicked smirk.

Qin Yu said with a cold expression on his face, “What do you mean by that?”

”Do what Su Yan and Zhao Gang used to do. You two can have an affair, so consider it revenge on Zhao Gang,” Sun Yumei said, blinking deviously.

Qin Yu instantly felt a sense of revulsion.

Qin Yu was disgusted to the core by the Su family.

”Don’t you guys feel disgusted when you sell your own body out for wealth?” Qin Yu said in a cold voice.

”I’m not a pervert like Zhao Gang is. Moreover, I feel disgusted at the sight of someone like Su Yan, so it’s better to leave you to Zhao Gang.” Qin Yu said without mercy.

When she heard Qin Yu’s words, Su Yan could not hold back her fury any longer.

She pointed her finger at Qin Yu and cursed, “Qin Yu, you really are shameless! Have you forgotten how you used to kiss up to me?”

”Just because I was a fool before doesn’t mean I’m a fool now.” Qin Yu said in an emotionless voice.

Su Yan said through gritted teeth, “Qin Yu, aren’t you just a freeloader? You’re a loser who has only relied on women all his life! We’ll see how long you can keep this cocky act up!”

Sun Yumei could not help but feel slightly annoyed that it was impossible to reconcile the two at this point.

Feeling defeated, Sun Yumei also changed her attitude and scolded, “Su Yan is right. You’re a total loser who will stay a loser for the rest of your life!”

As expected, a leopard never changes its spots.

Fortunately, Qin Yu did not give a hoot anymore. He said coldly, “Get out! Get out immediately!”

Su Yan crossed her arms and snickered as she said, “You have the nerve to curse at me? Don’t think you can do whatever you want just because you have the Yan family to protect you! Remember how Lei Hu beat you up last time? I can get Zhao Gang to call Lei Hu to beat you up again.”
