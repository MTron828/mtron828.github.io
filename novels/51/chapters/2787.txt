Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“This thing is probably not easy for us to fight for. Let’s find an opportunity to retreat. ”

Aiden shook his head and replied.

He had fought with Qin Ji before, so he knew how powerful this woman was.

Smoker Xie was even stronger than her, but he was only ranked third.

Therefore, the things that were triggered here were not things that they could touch.

That thing even suppressed Qin Yu’s Dao of Dreams. This made him feel even more uncertain.

“It’s best if we can leave, but I’m afraid we won’t have the chance now.” Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

He had already seen many familiar people, causing him to feel upset.

The two golden-haired men were obviously from Lord Alester’s tribe.

The swordsman from before was also powerful.

Most of the others were people from the Nine Nether Cliff. These people had cultivated here for many years and were extremely powerful existences.

“Hahaha! I didn’t expect the few fortune tellers to be correct this time. There is something born here that can make that old fellow excited. It must have great collection value.”

A flying carpet floated past and the four people landed.

A round figure stood out among them.

His body shone with treasure light.

The treasure light crushed those Creepy around him into pieces before they got close to him.

“Hello, brothers and sisters. This is the name card of my Situ family. If you want to become a guest elder, you can go to Saint World’s Treasure Origin to look for the Situ Clan. The pay will definitely satisfy everyone. Brother, here is the talisman for you. It can protect you from all the attacks below peak power level 12. Wait, you’re only a level 9 Dao Consciousness. Let go of your hand. I was mistaken. Give it back to me.”

The entire bottom of the Nine Nether Cliff became lively with the arrival of Fatty Situ.

“Who is this stupid fatty? The landlord’s silly son?”

Chang Mang was baffled. This was the first time he had met someone he thought silly.

“Could it be Fatty from the Situ family? Looking at the appearance of the magical artifacts around him, I guess there’s no mistake. However, why is the Situ family here?”

Aiden was confused.

These top clans had established their forces outside the 18 Saint Kingdoms in the Saint World.

This was because the Saint Lord was the number one in the Saint Kingdom. The development of a family’s power would be severely suppressed.

Therefore, the top clans in the Saint World like the Situ and the Alester family, developed outside the Saint Kingdom.

However, their power could even affect the 18 Holy Lords.

“Boss Qin Yu, why are you here too?”

Fatty Situ suddenly noticed Qin Yu.

His eyes instantly widened. Then the treasure light that soared into the sky suddenly smashed beside Qin Yu. “How dare you!”

Chang Mang punched out.

However, the talisman on Fatty Situ’s body lit up. The rebound force hit his

head until he was dizzy.

Whoosh!

A strand of white silk flew out from Fatty’s belt, coiling around Chang Mang like a white snake.

He was wrapped up like a dumpling.

Chang Mang shouted, “Hey! Hey!”

Five to six massive streams of spiritual energy immediately swept out. Five to six talismans glowed with a terrifying light, smashing down on Chang Mang’s body like mountains.

“Ouch! It hurts so much! Da*n it! I’ll definitely smash you into a meat patty when I come out.”

Chang Mang’s lips trembled in pain as he began to spout nonsense. Aiden rolled his eyes and looked at Chang Mang like an idiot.

“You’re still alive!”

Fatty Situ was curious.

He held a sharp knife in his hand and carefully poked Chang Mang’s lower body.

“Big brother, I was wrong! I’m sorry!”

Chang Mang was so frightened that his hair stood on end. Just what was the background of this da*n fatty?

One had to know that the power that could directly suppress him was at least the peak power of level 12.

Moreover, this fatty’s body was still shining with treasure light. It was unknown how many tricks he had yet to use. “Fatty Situ, this is my friend. Don’t do that!”

Qin Yu coughed and stopped Fatty Situ.

“So he is the boss’ friend! Alright!”

Fatty Situ hurriedly untied Chang Mang.

“Brother, how should I address you? Are you interested in becoming the Situ family’s guest elder? I guarantee that you’ll be satisfied with the pay. Moreover, the little sisters of the Situ family are all first-class peerless beauties.”

Fatty Situ moved his chubby face closer to Chang Mang.

“Fatty Situ, let’s not talk about this for now. Didn’t you leave the Saint Kingdom after the Heavenly Sins? Why are you back?”

Qin Yu covered his forehead.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“I’m not too sure either. We received a message from Father when we were about to leave, telling us to come to this area. It seems that a powerful force has awakened here, so we came to see if there’s something we can get our hands on.”

Fatty Situ laughed.

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed.

According to what Fatty Situ had said, the thing here wasn’t simple. Even the wealthiest family in the entire Saint World had sent Fatty Situ here.

This meant that the things here were not even lower than the Heavenly Sin.

Furthermore, the presence of the Alester family further deepened his judgment.

“F*ck, how do you know such an awesome and stupid fatty? And he seems to be very respectful to you.”

Chang Mang looked at Qin Yu strangely.

No matter how stupid he was, he could tell this fatty had an amazing background. He was not as stupid as he appeared to be.

After a short period of noise, the place fell into a dead silence again.

Whether it was the many Creepy gathered here long ago or the people who arrived later, they all fell into a tacit understanding and waited quietly.

However, Qin Yu felt that something seemed to be brewing in the place he had explored previously.

An oppressive feeling instantly spread throughout Qin Yu’s chest.

Everything in front of him seemed to be starting to blur. Qin Yu shook his head.

He realized that the space seemed to be shaking and even changing shape.

Moreover, this range was still increasing.

Chi!

Countless Creepy’s bodies exploded. Sticky blood splattered everywhere.

Almost at the same time, many humans could not withstand this terrifying pressure and their bodies exploded.

This pressure was still rising at a terrifying speed. This terrifying pressure had already tripled from before in just a few breaths.

Qin Yu only felt his body making a ‘lump’ sound. This was the sound of his bones enduring an extremely great pressure and rubbing against his muscles.

Fatty Situ opened the Heavenly Umbrella and landed on Aiden..
