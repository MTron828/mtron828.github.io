2144 The Angry Yan Family

Uncle Yan opened his mouth and said without confidence, “I… I don’t know either.”

“You don’t know?” Yan Tianshi’s expression instantly turned cold.

He raised his palm, and a speck of light gathered in his palm.

Yan Tianshi seemed to be activating some technique to read Uncle Yan’s divine sense forcefully.

Uncle Yan knew he had no way to lie to Yan Tianshi. Thus he had no choice but to tell him everything.

When Yan Tianshi heard that Yan Ruoxue had escaped with Qin Yu, his face turned uglier.

The next moment, he raised his palm and slapped Uncle Yan’s face!

The force of the slap was tremendous, and Uncle Yan did not dare to defend himself. His body was instantly sent flying, and the bones of his face shattered!

“Scoundrel!” Yan Tianshi shouted.

Uncle Yan’s expression was ugly, but he did not dare to say anything.

“Is your Yan family fooling us?” Si Liuhe said with a dark face.

Yan Tianshi took a deep breath, looked at Si Liuhe, and said, “I will sort out this matter.”

“Hehe, my Si family is one of the nine great aristocratic families. Furthermore, our Si Shiyue is a chaotic body, a proud son of heaven. Is he not worthy of your Yan family’s saintess? I…” Si Liuhe said in a sarcastic tone.

“I’ve said I’ll sort out the matter!” At this moment, Yan Tianshi suddenly shouted. Si Liuhe’s words were instantly stuck in his throat, and he dared not say anything further.

As the Holy Lord of the Yan family, Yan Tianshi’s aura was much stronger than that of the Holy Lord of the Si family.

“It’s useless to say anything now. Let’s hurry up and chase after them,” someone at the side suggested.

Yan Tianshi was silent. He raised his palm, and thousands of dao techniques instantly gathered.

Slightly closing his eyes, Yan Tianshi was as if deducing something.

A few minutes later, Yan Tianshi said coldly, “All the True Saints of the Yan family, follow me.”

“Yes, sir!” Several True Saints immediately stepped forward.

These few words expressed Yan Tianshi’s anger.

He did not waste time and quickly left this place.

After they left, Si Liuhe waved his hand and said, “All the True Saints of the Si family, follow me and go after Yan Ruoxue!”

“Yes, sir!” The Si family took action together. At this moment, they could not be bothered by the demon race of the Azure Rock Forest anymore.

“Elder, you as a True Saint, isn’t Yan Tianshi being too disrespectful to you?” a True Saint of the Si family said unhappily.

“That’s right. Yan Tianshi is only at the True Saint Realm. As a True Saint, Elder is definitely not afraid of him!” another True Saint said.

Si Liuhe glanced at them and said coldly, “Do you know his name?”

“Yes, I know. Isn’t it just Yan Tianshi?” A True Saint snorted coldly.

Si Liuhe sneered and continued, “What about the Immortal Emperor of the Yan family?”

“It’s Yan Tianming. He… Yan Tianming? Yan Tianshi? Could it be the Holy Lord of the Yan family is related to Yan Tianming?” Everyone was instantly shocked!

Si Liuhe shook his head and said, “Yan Tianming was a figure from tens of thousands of years ago, so he can’t have a brotherly relationship with Yan Tianshi. However, the fact that he dared to use this name has indicated something.”

The True Saints of the Si family suddenly understood, and no one dared to say anything else.

At the place the Path of Heaven descended, Dean Lei naturally heard the news.

“This kid even dared to kidnap the Yan family’s saintess.” Dean Lei shook his head repeatedly.

But soon, Dean Lei grinned again.

“That’s right. A man should dare to love and hate,” Dean Lei stroked his beard, laughed loudly, and said.

As Dean Lei was saying this, he deliberately glanced at the hunchbacked old woman beside him.

This old woman was none other than Flower Granny.

However, Flower Granny did not have any reaction at this moment. She leaned on her walking stick like an elderly person in her twilight years.

After that, Dean Lei waved his hand and left the place.

“This Qin Yu really wants to offend all the great aristocratic families… Cough cough…” a pale young man said in the dark.

“The fact that he monopolized the Traceless Immortal Scripture is no different from offending the various aristocratic families,” an old man beside the prince said at this moment. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The prince looked into the distance silently.

“Your Highness, the descent of the Path of Heaven has ended. It’s time for you to return to Peach Blossom Island,” a few armored warriors walked over and said at this moment.

The prince sighed lightly, then shook his head and left.

On the other end, Yan Ruoxue was steering the Yan family’s ancient ship toward Astral Mountain.

At this moment, Qin Yu looked tremendously weak. He looked pale and cold sweat was flowing down. He seemed on the verge of fainting at any moment.

However, he still gritted his teeth and pretended to be safe and sound.

“Qin Yu, are you alright?” Worry filled Yan Ruoxue’s fair face.

“I’m fine. We’ll be safe when we reach Astral Mountain…” Qin Yu forced a smile.

Yan Ruoxue opened her mouth. She knew Qin Yu’s character, so she did not say anything further. She just gritted her teeth and sped up.

Yan Ruoxue knew the Yan family would not be deceived for too long. They would soon find out about this.

On the ancient ship, the atmosphere was a little heavy. The tension of chasing and escaping filled the air. Each time the ancient ship passed through the stars in the void, it would cause a burst of dazzling light like a meteor, cutting the dark starry sky into beautiful arcs.

Qin Yu was sitting by the side. His breathing became a little labored, but he still had a smile on his face. His eyes were fixed on Yan Ruoxue as if he was trying to find some strength in her face.

After an unknown amount of time, the silhouette of Astral Mountain finally appeared within their line of sight.

Yan Ruoxue was instantly overjoyed. She hurriedly turned to Qin Yu and said, “Soon, we will reach Astral Mountain!”

Qin Yu also heaved a sigh of relief. He forced a smile and said, “Finally…”

But at this moment, Yan Ruoxue’s expression slightly changed, and she hurriedly said, “It has been a long time since the gate of Astral Mountain remained unopened. That gate has been sealed for many years, and we don’t know how to open it. Even if we arrive, it will probably be very difficult to open the formation…”

Upon hearing this, Qin Yu smiled, shook his head, and said, “Don’t worry… In simple terms, Astral Mountain is just a huge teleportation formation… As for the method to open the door, I’ve already memorized it by heart. The materials are also in my Spatial Magical Artifact.”

Yan Ruoxue said in surprise, “I didn’t expect you to be so meticulous. It seems that you have indeed grown a lot over the years.”

Qin Yu said half-jokingly and half-seriously, “It’s hard not to grow up having a perfect wife.”

Yan Ruoxue’s pretty face blushed, and she seemed to be a little shy.

If anyone else saw this expression, they would be shocked. The dignified saintess of the Yan family actually had such a feminine side to her.
