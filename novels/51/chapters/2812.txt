Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The gate of hell!

In an instant, the sky was filled with evil ghost generals.

These evil ghosts were the most ferocious evil behind the gate of hell. They used their bodies to block the sunlight.

Thousands of ferocious ghosts even pounced on the sun and began to gnaw on it crazily.

In the blink of an eye, thousands of huge ghosts instantly melted into ghostly qi that filled the sky. Then, they were evaporated by the terrifying high temperature and completely disappeared from the Ksitigarbha Saint Kingdom.

However, hundreds of thousands of huge ghosts rushed out from the gate of hell again and bit the sun in the sky.

Countless giant ghost hands stretched out from the gate of hell.

Every ghostly hand exuded a powerful force. The space they passed by was shattered.

However, the entire Saint Kingdom let out a dull sound when these ghostly hands appeared as if they couldn’t bear the power of the ghostly hand’s owner.

These ghostly hands suddenly grabbed the scorching sun.

Then, that huge force suddenly erupted, wanting to pull him into the gate of hell.

The Ksitigarbha Saint Kingdom once again returned to its previous appearance. The scorching sun slowly disappeared and melted.

However, Ksitigarbha’s face was solemn. At this moment, the first rays of dawn shone on his body. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The warmth of the morning sun made Ksitigarbha tremble.

The second, third, and fourth sun revealed half its face on the horizon.

Even before they rose, the terrifying heat had already killed nearly half of the living beings in the Ksitigarbha Saint Kingdom.

The entire Ksitigarbha Saint Kingdom would be barren when the other three suns rose.

This was the power of the Investiture of Gods. Once the divine soul became god, it would belong to the Investiture of Gods.

Ksitigarbha let out an angry roar. His expression was ferocious.

In the end, a streak of green energy rushed out from the gate of hell and disappeared into the clouds before the power gradually disappeared.

Ksitigarbha stared silently at the horizon that had returned to darkness. He did not move for a long time.

It was the first time he felt such a sense of dread when facing this energy.

Although he still had some backup plans, he was not confident. Therefore, he gave up on Xiao Hai’s portion of the divine soul.

Xiao Hai, who was in the Investiture of Gods, suddenly trembled. Two streams of tears slowly flowed down from his pupils.

Those lost memories were finally back.

He had once set protecting the human race as his goal, but he had ultimately joined the ghost race and even lost most of his memories regarding the human race. This was a huge blow to a person like him.

As a result, he had used up all of his lifespan in Heavenly Sin and forcefully used the Spacetime Hall to overdraw a large amount of time. He had even paid the price of losing his life to live on Heavenly Sin.

However, he did not expect the memories he lost would be regained because of the Investiture of Gods under a strange combination of factors.

“Such terrifying power! Even Ksitigarbha could not resist!”

Xiao Hai raised his head and looked at the dazzling space.

“What a terrifying power! But I still have to thank you.”

Xiao Hai’s lips curled into a smile.

It seemed to be getting more and more fun.

With the appearance of the Investiture of Gods, the originally silent Saint World was now shaking. Even many Holy Lords began to move. This was a major event that had never happened in the past thousand years.

After returning from the Investiture of Gods, Qin Yu still decided to make a trip to Lingxu City.

Almost all the people who had obtained the incomplete page of the Investiture of Gods were gathered in the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom. No matter what, he had to understand the information here. Otherwise, he would suffer a huge loss.

Furthermore, Daoist Master Cang Yunzi was in Lingxu City. With his information network, Qin Yu should be able to get a lot of information from him.

Then, the four of them did not stop and headed straight for Lingxu City.

“We have to be careful. We have to disguise ourselves as much as possible, including changing all our internal qi. Although Situ Qianxun didn’t reveal any clues back then, the four Holy Lords weren’t able to find him. Hence, if this fatty leaks any news that he’s still alive, I’m afraid that we won’t be able to move an inch in the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom. I wonder if you guys have noticed that there are many more experts’ internal qi here.”

Aiden said solemnly.

Even this small house in the forest had many experts entering its surroundings recently.

One had to know that this region was practically considered a forbidden area in the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom. This could only mean that the people here were mostly outsiders and their strength was extraordinary.

“Yes, it’s best to be careful. Let’s understand the current situation first before making any other plans.”

Qin Yu nodded.

“Holy Daughter, are you alright? Which personality are you now?”

“It’s me.”

Meng Jing said lightly.

“The other personality would only appear in this small house. She would be greatly stimulated elsewhere. Previously when I was seriously injured, I forced myself to hold on for a long time. When I woke up, I could no longer call for her. Although I came to the small house in the forest, I still could not wake her up.”

Meng Jing’s expression was a little gloomy.

This personality was the most innocent side of the holy daughter. When she was born, she was instilled with the big label of being born with cosmic luck.

Only in this place would she awaken that girlish personality. However, that personality might not wake up again. Qin Yu felt a little heartache.

“There must be a way to wake up little Meng Jing!”

Qin Yu gently patted Meng Jing’s shoulder.

Although this place was relatively close to Lingxu City, Qin Yu and the rest used the fatty family’s magical artifact to change their aura.

“Boss Qin Yu, you guys must be careful. This involves the Investiture of Gods, so our information is likely to be recorded by someone with ulterior motives. After all, we can’t hide our entry into the Treasure Continent before this, so it’s best to hide our information. Otherwise, we’ll be in big trouble.”

Fatty Situ said in a serious tone.

“The Masquerade Mask can change a person’s aura from the very roots. Unless a Holy Consciousness expert uses his divine sense to examine it, it’s impossible to determine the original appearance. However, there’s a fatal flaw. Once holy energy is used, it will immediately lose its effect. Therefore, we must avoid any conflicts along the way.”

“Okay!”

Qin Yu nodded. Right now, they were at the center of the vortex.

When the news of the Situ family spread, everyone who had visited the Situ family would become the suspect of taking away the Investiture of Gods.

Such a power that could make the four Holy Lords personally come was not to be underestimated. Hence, Qin Yu did not dare to relax in the slightest.

After confirming the things they had to pay attention to, they mixed into a huge treasure-hunting team.

After going through a round of torment, they finally entered Lingxu City.

“It is as prosperous as before outside Lingxu City. Many people are searching for their fortuitous encounters. However, the atmosphere inside the city is different from outside. These true experts have already smelled some kind of danger.”
