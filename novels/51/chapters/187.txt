Chapter 188: It’s Actually You? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Cold sweat dripped down the two robbers’ foreheads. They didn’t want to kill anyone at all!

“Shoot!” Qin Yu immediately shouted!

“You’re f * cking courting death. Don’t blame us!” The two robbers instantly flew into a rage! They immediately pulled the trigger!

“Bang!”

The gunshot sounded in everyone’s ears!

“Ah!!” Screams echoed in the cabin!

However, the bullet only left a white mark on Qin Yu’s body. It didn’t even scratch his skin!

The faces of the two robbers instantly turned extremely pale!

How was this possible? He actually took the bullet?

Qin Yu picked up the bullet from the ground and sneered. “Do you still think it’s a special effect?”

The two robbers’ expressions were extremely ugly! At this moment, they were completely panicking!

Even a bullet couldn’t penetrate him. This person was definitely not someone they could afford to offend!

“Sir, we were wrong. Please spare our lives...” the two robbers knelt on the ground and desperately begged for mercy!

“Right, we will return the money now...”

Qin Yu glanced at the passengers on the plane and sneered. “I said, their lives have nothing to do with me.”

After saying that, Qin Yu went back to his seat and closed his eyes.

The two robbers were stunned and immediately understood!

They pulled out their guns and pointed at the people outside as they shouted, “All of you f * cking behave! Otherwise, I’ll shoot you all to death!”

These passengers couldn’t help but curse, “Are you f * cking human? You clearly can subdue them, but you aren’t doing anything!”

“You’re really a b*stard!”

Qin Yu looked at them coldly and said, “I have no obligation to save you guys. Besides, you said yourselves that you don’t need my help.”

After saying that, Qin Yu closed his eyes and ignored the crowd.

Yang Jing didn’t say anything, but she also felt relieved.

The plane was still flying high in the sky and soon arrived at the destination.

The two robbers had obviously made arrangements beforehand. As soon as they got off the plane, a car brought them out of the airport.

Meanwhile, these tourists hurriedly went to the police and told them what had happened!

“This jerk actually didn’t save us!” These tourists couldn’t find the robbers, so they placed the blame on Qin Yu.

“Yes, we must let this kid compensate for our losses!”

Facing the crowd’s shouts, the police shook his head and said, “He is the same as you guys. You guys are all passengers. If you can’t do anything about it, what can he do?”

“He has a way! You don’t know, but he sent the two robbers flying with a slap!”

“Yes, we also saw that his body can resist bullets!”

The passenger police said helplessly, “I think that you guys were so scared you guys had hallucinations.”

“Exactly. How can anyone take bullets? I was almost scared to death,” Qin Yu said while pretending to be pitiful.

The police officer waved his hand and said, “Okay, you can go now.”

These passengers were angry and anxious, but there was nothing they could do.

After walking out of the airport, Yang Jing couldn’t help but snicker, “You’re so petty, but it’s quite gratifying.”

Qin Yu smiled and didn’t say anything.

Yang Jing had already arranged for a car at the airport. After walking out of the airport, Qin Yu saw a Bentley parked at the entrance.

After following Yang Jing into the car, Qin Yu discovered that the driver was actually a foreigner.

“You guys immigrated?” Qin Yu frowned and asked.

Yang Jing shook her head and said, “No, my mom is from this country and my dad is from Pyro, but my nationality is still Pyro.”

Qin Yu suddenly understood.

So Yang Jing was a mixed blood.

The car sped all the way to an extremely large manor!

The size of this manor was beyond Qin Yu’s imagination!

In the manor, there were even basketball courts, football courts, and courts of other sports.

The trees in the entire manor were lush and verdant, and almost comparable to those of a forest.

“This is really too over the top.” Qin Yu looked at the surrounding environment and couldn’t help but exclaim in awe.

Yang Jing explained, “This is the suburbs, and the population of this country is small. It’s not surprising.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He followed Yang Jing to the center of the manor.

In the center of the manor was a huge castle. There were two tall foreigners guarding it.

Qin Yu and Yang Jing had just walked forward when they were stopped by the bodyguards.

“I’m sorry. Our family has a rule that we can’t bring our phones in,” Yang Jing said apologetically.

Qin Yu frowned and seemed a little unhappy.

But he didn’t say anything and handed over his phone obediently.

The structure of the castle was like a maze. Qin Yu followed Yang Jing left and right and finally arrived at Yang Jing’s father’s room.

At the door of the room, there was a nursing team in charge of looking after Yang Jing’s father, Yang Xiao.

And the person in charge of leading this nursing team was an internationally renowned doctor called Peter.

Yang Jing brought Qin Yu to Peter and introduced him, “This is Peter, my father’s attending physician.”

She then looked at Peter and said, “This is Qin Yu, a famous doctor from Pyro.”

Peter seemed a little displeased as he said with a dark expression, “Another liar has come.”

Yang Jing’s expression changed as she coughed and said, “Qin Yu, Peter has advised me not to look for another doctor. Don’t mind him.”

“I don’t mind.” Qin Yu was already used to Peter’s attitude.

Peter said coldly, “Miss Yang, it’s not that I don’t believe in the medical skills of your country. It’s just that the medical expertise of your country are in the hands of very few people. But this kid is obviously not one of them.”

Having said that, Peter paused and continued, “To tell you the truth, I have heard from my beloved disciple that there is a top renowned doctor in Pyro. Although he isn’t very famous, he has mind blowing medical skills!” Peter said

“I have always wanted to pay him a visit and at the same time invite him to treat Mr Yang’s illness.” Peter’s eyes seemed to be filled with yearning.

Qin Yu said politely, “Mr Peter, may I know who the doctor you are talking about is? Perhaps I know him.”

Peter glanced at Qin Yu contemptuously and snorted. “I have never seen him before, but my beloved disciple said that he is a genius. He is extremely different from a liar like you.”

Qin Yu was too lazy to argue with him. He immediately walked towards Yang Xiao.

“What are you doing?!” Peter immediately shouted and quickly grabbed Qin Yu’s arm.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “I have to take a look at Mr. Yang’s body first.”

Peter scolded, “I will never let you touch Mr. Yang.”

After that, he anxiously explained to Yang Jing, “Miss Yang, trust me. My disciple will go out tonight and invite that expert!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Yang Jing was a little helpless. She was about to speak when the door opened and a young man walked in.

“Mr. Peter!” He shouted as soon as he entered.

Peter was pleasantly surprised to see this young man.

“Mr. Xu, you came at the right time. Tell Miss Yang that this person is a liar!” Peter said excitedly.

However, when Peter’s disciple saw Qin Yu, he was stunned.

“Mr. ... Mr. Qin? Why are you here?” He shouted in surprise.

Qin Yu also said in surprise, “Xu Maojun?”

Peter’s disciple was none other than Xu Maojun, who had treated Wei Jiang’s illness.
