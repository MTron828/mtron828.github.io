Chapter 672: What Are the Consequences? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

As he looked at the torn document, Qu Xie’s expression changed drastically!

He glared at Ye Qing and said, “What... What do you mean?!”

Ye Qing said coldly, “What? Don’t you understand?”

“Ye Qing, don’t go too far! So what if you’re a war god in the Military District? You can’t be so overbearing!” Qu Xie gnashed his teeth and said.

Ye Qing looked coldly at Qu Xie and said, “If you don’t like it, you can sue me.”

“You!” Qu Xie’s chest rose and fell in anger, and his face was even more livid.

“Don’t even think about taking him away today!” Qu Xie said through gritted teeth.

Ye Qing snorted coldly and said, “If you dare to disobey my orders, I have the right to punish you on the spot.”

Ye Qing waved his hand, and a large group of armed soldiers immediately rushed in from outside!

Not only that, but the Jingdu Martial Arts Association was also surrounded!

Qu Xie’s expression was extremely ugly!

It was obvious that Ye Qing was determined to take him away.

If he clashed with Ye Qing today, it would be equivalent to defying the authorities!

The consequences weren’t something Qu Xie could withstand!

“Release him!” Ye Qing shouted!

Qu Xie gritted his teeth. Although he was unwilling, he still waved his hand and said coldly, “Release him!”

The light of the Martial Saint weapon that was hanging around began to dim.

A few people moved their arms and legs and released Qin Yu.

Xia Hang finally heaved a sigh of relief.

“I really didn’t expect Ye Qing to come and rescue him,” Xia Hang thought to himself.

He looked at Qin Yu and found it hard to understand.

All of this was in Qin Yu’s plan? How did he get Ye Qing to come and rescue him?

Qin Yu walked down from the execution platform. He looked at Qu Xie coldly and said word by word, “Qu Xie, you still remember what I told you, right?”

Qu Xie’s expression changed slightly. He said coldly, “Don’t be too proud. The Jingdu Martial Arts Association won’t let you off so easily!”

“Okay, I’ll wait,” Qin Yu said coldly. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Come with me,” Ye Qing glanced at Qin Yu and said.

Qin Yu showed his gratitude and left the Jingdu Martial Arts Association with Ye Qing.

After leaving the gate, Qin Yu found that the gate was already surrounded by soldiers.

This was the power of the government. The Jingdu Martial Arts Association definitely wasn’t comparable to them.

After getting into the car, Qin Yu bowed to Ye Qing and said, “Thank you, Officer Ye.”

Ye Qing glanced at Qin Yu and said, “Don’t be happy too early. The Jingdu Martial Arts Association will definitely not let this go.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I know. Thank you for the reminder, Officer Ye.”

The car continued forward and came to a place where no one was around.

At this moment, the car stopped.

Ye Qing opened the car door and said, “Get out.”

Qin Yu was stunned and said somewhat awkwardly, “Won’t you lock me up for a few days?”

Ye Qing frowned and said, “If I tell you to get out, then get out. Why do you have to talk so much nonsense?”

Qin Yu shrugged and hurriedly jumped out of the car.

After getting out of the car, Ye Qing didn’t say anything and left with his people.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said in a low voice, “The plan... finally succeeded.”

He didn’t stay any longer and immediately rushed to the Green Moon Villa.

There was a spiritual spring in the Green Moon Villa, and Qin Yu planned to use this spiritual spring to cultivate while waiting for the man with the mustache.

The Jingdu Martial Arts Association would definitely continue to send out purple-robbed men to kill Qin Yu.

And Qin Yu also clearly knew the gap between him and purple-robbed men.

As long as he entered the intermediate stage of the Martial Marquis Realm, Qin Yu would have the strength to fight.

...

On the other side, after Ye Qing saved him, he went straight to a private clubhouse.

In this clubhouse, there was a man in a Chinese tunic suit waiting for Ye Qing.

After Ye Qing entered the clubhouse, he saluted and said, “Greetings, Mr. Zhou.”

Mr. Zhou smiled and waved his hand, saying, “How is it? Everything is done?”

Ye Qing nodded and said, “Mr. Zhou, just as you expected, Qin Yu really came to me for help.”

Mr. Zhou laughed and said, “It seems that I didn’t misjudge him. Not bad.”

Ye Qing sat at Mr. Zhou’s side. He frowned and said, “Mr. Zhou, I don’t understand. Why are you helping him?”

“Helping him?” Mr. Zhou shook his head.

He said nonchalantly, “I’m not helping him. I’m borrowing his power.”

“Borrowing his power?” Ye Qing couldn’t help but be a little surprised.

Mr. Zhou took a puff of his cigarette and then slowly said, “The unorganized expansion of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association over the years has already caused dissatisfaction from the higher-ups.”

“But they are, after all, an organization of the martial arts world. If they were banned, it would cause unnecessary trouble.”

Upon hearing this, Ye Qing suddenly came to a realization.

He exclaimed, “You want to... use Qin Yu to attack the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?”

“That’s right,” Mr. Zhou said nonchalantly.

“As for whether he can do it or not, that will depend on him.”

Unknowingly, Qin Yu had become someone else’s chess piece, and Qin Yu didn’t even know about it.

Qin Yu returned to the Green Moon Villa.

Ever since Qin Yu killed Deng Sheng, no one in the Green Moon Villa dared to try and seize power.

In the hall, Zhen Yue was sitting upright. In front of him were two white-robed men from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

Although they were only white-robed men, their statuses were far above Zhen Yue’s.

“Sect Master Zhen, all the sects should be under the leadership of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association,” one of the white-robed men said with a nonchalant smile.

Zhen Yue frowned and said, “Green Moon Villa doesn’t want to get involved with the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

“Hehe, Sect Master Zhen, we’re reasoning with you now, but it won’t be like this next time,” one of the white-robed men said with a warning tone.

Zhen Yue frowned and said, “Let’s wait for Mr. Qin to come back before making a decision.”

“Haha, Sect Master Zhen, today is the day of Qin Yu’s execution. Don’t tell me you don’t know that?” The two white-robed men couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“Wait for him to come back? I’m afraid you won’t be able to.”

Zhen Yue gritted her teeth and said, “Nothing can be concluded without a result.”

“You two, please go back. We don’t welcome you here.” Zhen Yue stood up and said.

The white-robed man’s expression instantly turned cold as he snorted, “Sect Master Zhen, are you sending us off? Do you know the consequences of rejecting us today?!”

“You can’t bear the consequences. You’d better think it through!”

“What consequences?”

At this moment, a voice came from behind them.

They turned around and saw Qin Yu looking at them with a dark expression.
