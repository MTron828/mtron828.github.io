Chapter 930: Chapter 930, the Sky Blood Rainbow descended

After Uncle Zhen received the ancient Jade’s order, he immediately stealthily approached Xu Huaigu.

Just as Xu Huaigu was weakened, Uncle Zhen suddenly made a move. A claw-like palm directly grabbed at Xu Huaigu’s chest!

Xu Huaigu’s attention was already on star seizer, and his physical strength was extremely weak. He simply had no strength to dodge!

“Swish!”

Uncle Zhen’s claws ruthlessly tore through Xu Huaigu’s chest!

A large hole was instantly torn through his chest! Fresh blood spurted out like a fountain! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Go to hell!”Uncle Zhen had a crazed look on his face as his large hand ruthlessly slapped toward Xu Huaigu’s face!

“Senior Xu!”Qin Yu was immediately furious upon seeing this!

Right at this critical moment, Zhai Xing suddenly reached out and grabbed uncle Zhen’s wrist!

Then, Zhai Xing’s large palm fiercely slapped uncle Zhen’s chest, forcing him back several steps!

“Despicable and Shameless, who told you to secretly attack!”Zhai Xing was extremely furious!

Uncle Zhen clutched his cracked chest and braced himself as he said, “Lord Zhai Xing, I...”

“Get lost!”Zhai Xing grabbed Uncle Zhen and threw him out!

“Master Zhai Xing, there are no rules on the battlefield. Everything is decided by the outcome. I think there is no problem for Uncle Zhen to make a move,”wan gu Qiong said calmly.

Before Zhai Xing could speak, Wan Gu Qiong looked at gu xinghe and said, “I believe young master Gu thinks so too.”

Gu Xinghe said coldly, “Uncle Zhai Xing, you are too slow. You Can’t blame others.”

Zhai Xing could not help but clench his fists.

He glanced at Gu Xinghe and then at Xu Huaigu. Finally, he steeled his heart and walked toward Xu Huaigu.

“Damn it!”Qin Yu gritted his teeth.

There was no other way. He could only take out the two corpses and let them resurrect themselves!

Therefore, Qin Yu took out the space artifact and prepared to activate the two corpses to resurrect.

“I also want a share of this big mine. I wonder if everyone has any objections?”

At this moment, a voice suddenly came from outside the door.

Looking Up, he saw a young man walking over with a bewitching smile.

Seeing this young man, Gu Xinghe couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows.

“It’s You?”Gu Xinghe’s face couldn’t help but flash with a trace of mockery.

“If I remember correctly, your name is something called... Sky Blood Rainbow, right?”

The newcomer was none other than Sky Blood Rainbow of the immortal slaying sect!

“In this era, all kinds of gods and monsters have dared to appear,”Gu Xinghe continued to mock.

Sky Blood Rainbow was not angry. He swept his gaze across the crowd, his face still wearing a bewitching smile.

Gu Xinghe slowly stood up and said with a playful look, “Then tell me, how much do you want to share?”

Tian Xuehong put his hands behind his back and said with a faint smile, “19% , 90% for me, and 10% for you.”

“Hahahaha!”

As soon as he said this, everyone present burst into laughter!

Was this kid crazy?

Taking 90% for himself? Letting others take 10% ?

“Are you F * cking crazy?”

“Do you know who are all here?”

“With these seven martial saints here, do you even have the right to speak? !”

The crowd continued to clamor, but Tian Xuehong remained calm.

Meanwhile, the long eyebrows beside Gu Xinghe furrowed tightly.

Tian Xuehong?

He kept feeling that there was a familiar internal Qi on Tian Xuehong’s body...

“Kid, do you know what you’re talking about?”Uncle Otter stood up and said coldly.

Sky Blood Rainbow put his hands behind his back and said with a faint smile, “Looks like everyone doesn’t agree.”

“Agree? I think you haven’t woken up yet,”everyone said with a cold smile.

Sky Blood Rainbow nodded slightly and said, “Well, since everyone doesn’t agree, then I’ll change the plan.”

“I said 10-90 percent just now, but I’ve changed my mind now... 10 percent. I’ll Take 10, and you guys take zero.”

As soon as these words came out, everyone laughed even more happily.

They were basically certain that this Tian Xuehong was an idiot who did not have a good brain.

In front of the seven martial saints, he was clamoring to occupy a large spiritual stone mine? Wasn’t this pure nonsense?

On the stage, Gu Xinghe was laughing so hard that he was on the verge of tears.

“Recently, there has been a lot of idiots.”Gu Xinghe wiped the tears from his smile and shook his head helplessly.

“Which one of you is willing to teach this arrogant brat a lesson?”Gu Xinghe asked.

Uncle Otter rubbed his fist and sneered, “Let me do it.”

He walked straight to Tian Xuehong and said with a faint smile, “You said that you want to occupy the Spirit Stone Mine, right?”

Tian Xuehong nodded slightly and said, “You can interpret it that way.”

“You’re really... boasting shamelessly!”

As his voice fell, Uncle Otter’s two fists immediately erupted with a terrifying force and smashed towards Tian Xuehong’s head!

Tian Xuehong still had his hands behind his back and even slightly closed his eyes.

Just as the pair of iron fists were about to smash into Tian Xuehong’s body, a white bone suddenly flashed past and stood in front of Tian Xuehong!

“Clang!”

Uncle Otter’s fist landed squarely on the white bone’s body!

Uncle Otter was forced back a few steps by this force. On the other hand, the white bone did not even leave a white mark!

“What is this thing?”Uncle Otter could not help but frown.

The others also started to discuss, “A white bone? Where did the white bone come from?”

“This skeleton is so hard. It can actually withstand a strike from a martial saint!”

While everyone was discussing, Long Mei suddenly thought of something!

Skeleton!

It was the skeleton that had torn a half-step martial saint into pieces in the Massacre Immortal sect!

“Not good!”Long Mei’s expression changed drastically.

He hurriedly looked at GU xinghe and said, “Young master Gu, this person must not be provoked! He is that mysterious person from the Massacre Immortal sect!”

However, it was already too late. Tian Xuehong shook his finger slightly and said indifferently, “Kill him and teach them a lesson.”

Having received the order, white bones immediately rushed towards Uncle Otter!
