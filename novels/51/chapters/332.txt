Chapter 333: The Conflict Escalated Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Set up a trap? What kind of trap can he set up?” Qin Yu didn’t really care.

Taozi didn’t speak much to begin with, so she didn’t say anything more.

The two of them sat there and waited for a long time.

It wasn’t until noon that someone walked in from outside.

It was a young man dressed luxuriously.

Behind him were two men dressed as bodyguards.

Qin Yu took a closer look and realized that these two bodyguards were actually third level Inner Strength Grandmasters.

“Even the bodyguards are third level Inner Strength Grandmasters. I think he must have quite a background,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

The young man strode to Qin Yu and sat down.

He sized up Qin Yu and said, “You’re the one who will treat me?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “That’s right. What’s wrong?”

The young man stretched and said, “Aren’t you an apothecary? Can’t you tell?”

Qin Yu frowned. His attitude was really displeasing.

“Forget it. I’m here to buy medicine. I’ve already discussed it with your elders.” The young man waved his hand.

He took out a prescription and slammed it on the table.

There were four to five types of pill names on the table.

These pills were all ordinary pills, so it wasn’t difficult to refine them.

“Qin Yu, let me do it.” At this moment, Taozi suddenly said.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I have the same intention.”

However, at this moment, the young man suddenly stood up and looked at Qin Yu coldly while saying, “Are you that infamous Qin Yu?”

Qin Yu asked suspiciously, “I don’t seem to know you, right?”

The young man laughed loudly. “Hahaha, of course you don’t know me, but I know you!”

“I’m Han Shixun of the Han family!” The young man said coldly.

“Han family? The Han family of Jingdu?” Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

The young man said indifferently, “That’s right. What a coincidence. I didn’t expect to meet you here.”

Taozi saw the tension between the two. She hurriedly walked forward and said, “Qin Yu, go to the side. Let me do it.”

After saying that, Taozi walked in front of Han Shixun and said politely, “Sir, I’m also an apothecary of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. I’ll refine a pill for you now.”

“You?” Han Shixun sized up Taozi, then slapped her!

Taozi’s face immediately turned red from the slap, and a clear palm print appeared on her face.

“Who do you think you are? Get lost! I want Qin Yu to refine medicine for me personally!” Han Shixun sneered.

Anger flashed in Taozi’s eyes, but due to his identity, she endured it.

Qin Yu’s expression turned a bit cold.

However, this was the Divine Alchemist Pavilion after all, and Qin Yu had just arrived. It was probably inappropriate for him to cause trouble here.

Therefore, Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “This is the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. If you want to cause trouble, we can just go out.”

Han Shixun played dumb and said, “I just want to buy a pill. How am I causing trouble? Isn’t the Divine Alchemist Pavilion being unreasonable?”

Qin Yu suppressed his anger and nodded. “Okay, I’ll refine the pill for you now.”

After saying that, Qin Yu looked at Taozi and said, “Go and get the cauldron and the herbs for me.”

“Okay,” Taozi answered. She walked to the side and took the cauldron and the herbs needed.

After the cauldron was set up, a blue spiritual fire suddenly lit up in Qin Yu’s palm.

The fire burned fiercely in the medicinal cauldron, and the herbs quickly turned into medicinal liquid.

The herbs that Han Shixun needed were very ordinary, so Qin Yu only spent half an hour before successfully refining the pill.

Five pills were placed in front of Han Shixun.

“Take your pills and leave quickly.” Qin Yu suppressed the anger inside and said.

Han Shixun pinched the pill with his fingers and glanced at it. Then, he threw it on the ground and crushed it with one foot.

“What kind of bullsh*t did you refine? You failed. Refine it again for me!” Han Shixun said with a smile.

Qin Yu’s expression became colder and colder.

He suppressed his anger and said, “Han Shixun, I’m warning you. Don’t go too far.”

Han Shixun laughed and said, “Even if I go too far, so what?”

After saying that, he grabbed the pills and threw them all on the ground.

“Refine them again until I’m satisfied!” Han Shixun snorted coldly.

Qin Yu stared at Han Shixun and didn’t say anything for a long time.

Many pharmacists also surrounded him.

Countless gazes were on Qin Yu.

The Divine Alchemist Pavilion had rules. No one was allowed to get violent in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, let alone bully the customers who buy medicine. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Therefore, Qin Yu suppressed his anger and nodded. “Okay, I’ll refine it for you again.”

He picked up a few herbs and refined the medicine for Han Shixun again.

Another half an hour passed.

Five pills fell into Qin Yu’s hands.

Qin Yu handed the pill to Han Shixun and said coldly, “Take your pills and get lost!”

Han Shixun glanced at it and sneered. “What the h*ll did you refine? Candy? You can’t even feed this thing to dogs.”

“Sir, there’s no problem with the pill Qin Yu refined.” Another pharmacist at the side couldn’t stand it anymore.

Han Shixun glared at him and said with a cold expression, “What has it got to do with you? Do you have a problem with the Han family?”

When they heard the words ‘Han family’, the expressions of many pharmacists immediately changed, and they all took a step back.

“Qin Yu, bear with it. After all, he is a member of the Han family,” someone even walked forward and reminded him in a low voice.

Han Shixun sat on the chair and said proudly, “Re-refine. Don’t waste my time!”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Okay, I’ll re-refine it for you.”

This time, Qin Yu took a few different herbs and threw them into the cauldron.

Not only that, but Qin Yu’s refining method seemed to be different from before.

Everyone couldn’t help but frown. For a moment, they couldn’t understand Qin Yu’s intention.

Soon, a black pill fell into Qin Yu’s hand.

Qin Yu held the pill and said coldly, “Are you satisfied this time?”

Han Shixun sized it up and said with a frown, “What is this thing? Are you trying to swindle me?”

Qin Yu said with a sneer, “It’s a Power-dissipating Pill.”

“Power-dissipating Pill?” People around immediately exclaimed!

The Power-dissipating Pill, as the name implied, would damage the foundation and might even force one’s strength to regress as long as one swallowed this pill!

Han Shixun’s expression gradually turned cold. He narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “Leave this Power-dissipating Pill for yourself to eat.”

“No, this is a gift from me to you. You have to eat it even if you don’t want to!” Qin Yu said coldly.

As soon as he said that, Qin Yu reached out and grabbed Han Shixun’s chin!

Then, Qin Yu forcefully opened Han Shixun’s mouth!

“How dare you?!” Han Shixun’s two bodyguards were instantly furious. They reached out their hands to grab Qin Yu!

“Get lost!” Qin Yu didn’t even look at them. He raised his hand and used the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist!

The two bodyguards were instantly sent flying!

“You like to cause trouble, right?” Qin Yu said coldly.

“I don’t care what family you’re from. Other people might let you have your way, but I won’t!” After saying that, Qin Yu stuffed this Power-dissipating Pill into Han Shixun’s mouth!
