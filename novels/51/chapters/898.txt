Chapter 899: Chapter 899, uninvited guests 

Qin Yu’s heart was filled with reluctance, but he also knew that he could not afford to delay any longer.

Thus, Qin Yu resolutely picked up Yan Ruoxue and Strode into the depths of the forest.

This mystic realm was extremely large, and most of it was filled with trees, mountains, and rivers.

It was not too difficult to hide a person.

Qin Yu found a relatively quiet place for Yan Ruoxue.

After settling her down, Qin Yu turned around and planned to leave the mystic realm.

After taking only two steps forward, Qin Yu could not help but stop and look at Yan Ruoxue again.

His eyes were filled with reluctance. He did not know if he would be able to return alive after leaving this time.

“I can’t waste any more time.”Qin Yu glanced at the sun hanging in the sky and knew that it was getting late.

Even if he was extremely reluctant, he still had to leave.

Qin Yu left this place in large strides and came to the vicinity of the entrance.

“Are you really going to do this?”Li Yu couldn’t help but ask.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “En, I can only do this. After I leave, you can find time to leave this place.”

Li Yu grunted and didn’t say anything more. He planned to open the mystic realm for Qin Yu.

But at this moment.

The entrance in front of the two suddenly flashed with a ray of light!

Upon seeing this ray of light, the two’s expressions changed drastically!

“Someone is opening the mystic realm!”Li Yu exclaimed in shock.

Qin Yu’s face was extremely pale! He never expected that they would arrive so quickly!

“Buzz!”

A Ray of light flashed past. Following that, two middle-aged men suddenly appeared in front of the two!

The method to open the secret realm seemed a little strange, and they didn’t seem to have entered through the entrance.

Qin Yu pulled Li Yu back two steps, his eyes full of vigilance.

The two middle-aged men in front of him had internal Qi like water, so Qin Yu couldn’t sense their strength at all.

“You guys came really fast,”Qin Yu said with narrowed eyes.

“Which one is master du?”Qin Yu glanced at the two of them.

The two of them looked at each other and said with some doubt, “Master du? Who Is He?”

“Stop pretending! Don’t think I don’t know that it’s that master du who opened the Secret Realm!”Qin Yu said coldly.

Immediately, a terrifying internal Qi burst out from Qin Yu’s body.

He looked at the two of them coldly and said, “Yan Ruoxue is not here. You’d better get out of Here!”

A strange smile appeared on the two middle-aged men’s faces.

They ignored qin yu and said, “Then the bloodline is here, right?”

“That’s right. There won’t be any problems. I didn’t expect the most complete bloodline of the Yan family to appear here.”

“TSK TSK. If she hadn’t stepped into the realm of a martial grandmaster, we wouldn’t have been able to sense his internal Qi.”

Their words confirmed Qin Yu’s thoughts!

These two people had come for the bloodline!

“Two beasts...”Qin Yu couldn’t help but clench his teeth.

“You dare to Covet Yan Ruoxue’s Bloodline, I will definitely tear you into pieces! !”

Following Qin Yu’s furious roar, his internal Qi suddenly soared!

The entire mystic realm rumbled, as if it couldn’t withstand this power!

However, the two of them did not move at all. They just quietly looked at Qin Yu.

“Let me tell you, as long as there are people who are tainted by Ruoxue’s bloodline, I will not let any of them go,”Qin Yu growled. Then, he raised his hand and broke all the internal Qi with one punch!

All the internal Qi gathered on this punch. The terrifying power almost penetrated the secret realm!

However, the two of them only raised their hands and gently patted Qin Yu’s hand.

The internal Qi on Qin Yu’s hand was instantly exhausted. The layer of golden light also disappeared without a trace.

Qin Yu’s expression instantly became extremely ugly! He glanced at his own fist and exclaimed, “Is this the martial saint’s Method... ?”

“Martial saint? Young Man, what are you talking about?”One of the middle-aged men asked.

“F * ck you!”Qin Yu did not have the mood to listen to their nonsense. He immediately clenched his fist and rushed over.

A hint of helplessness flashed across the middle-aged man’s face. He raised his hand and gently pressed forward.

In an instant, Qin Yu’s body seemed to bear the weight of a thousand tons as his entire body fell to the ground!

His vision started to blur, and the entire world became darker and darker. His eyes seemed to be unable to open.

“From what I hear, you seem to have a good relationship with the possessor of the complete bloodline, so we won’t kill you. You should calm down.”

This was the last sentence Qin Yu heard before he fainted.

He fell heavily to the ground and did not move at all.

Upon seeing this scene, Li Yu’s face was filled with shock.

Even Qin Yu did not have the strength to retaliate, let alone a mystic realm master like him!

“I hope they won’t be able to discover Yan Ruoxue...”Li Yu prayed in his heart.

The two of them slowly flew into the air. Their eyes narrowed slightly and in the next second, they shot toward Yan Ruoxue!

In less than half a minute, the middle-aged man walked out with Yan Ruoxue in his arms.

“How... how is this possible!”Li Yu’s expression was extremely unsightly!

Qin Yu’s carefully concealed internal Qi was actually broken just like that?

“This is the complete bloodline of the Yan family...”one of the middle-aged men said in a low voice.

“En, as expected, her bloodline is the most complete I’ve ever seen.”Another middle-aged man also said.

“Alright, the mission is complete. We should go back.”The two of them looked at each other and planned to leave. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

At this moment, Li Yu suddenly shouted, “Who are you people! What do you want to do to Miss Yan!”

The two of them looked at Li Yu in front of them and said with a faint smile, “Do we need to explain it to you?”

Li Yu gritted his teeth and said, “If you don’t say it, don’t even think about leaving here!”

“Hahaha!”One of them could not help but laugh out loud.

“You should be a mystic realm master, right?”He sized up Li Yu and said.

Li Yu’s expression changed and he exclaimed, “You... how did you know!”

He ignored Li Yu’s words and said, “As a mystic realm master, I don’t think you’re good at fighting. Don’t waste your energy.”

“Also... your professional level doesn’t seem to be very good. There’s a gap in this mystic realm. Didn’t you notice?”

Li Yu said with a cold face, “Of course I know there’s a gap, but I can’t make up for it.”

“I see...”the middle-aged man heard that and immediately fell into deep thought.

In the next second, he raised his palm slightly. In an instant, the entire sky of the mystic realm was enveloped by a five-colored light!

When he saw this strange phenomenon, Li Yu’s eyes immediately widened!

The five-colored light flashed and disappeared without a trace in a moment.

“You... What did you do? !”Li Yu exclaimed in shock.

“No need to be nervous. I just fixed the gap,”the middle-aged man said indifferently.
