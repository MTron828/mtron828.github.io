Chapter 1664: Chapter 1,644, the throne Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

There were too many legends on Earth. Before Qin Yu embarked on the path of cultivation, he had heard countless legends.

If it was in the past, Qin Yu naturally wouldn’t believe it. But ever since he embarked on the path of cultivation, he discovered many coincidences, as well as the world that was silent under the sea.

Following his heart, he looked at Qin Yu with a hint of doubt in his eyes.

After a while, he slowly opened his mouth and said, “Many people have descended from the holy region. Most of them came from the various major life star systems in the universe. I have never heard of the Earth that you mentioned.”

“Impossible.”Qin Yu shook his head without even thinking.

He was very clear in his heart that someone had definitely descended from Earth to the southern region.

For example, the immortal slaying sect had ruins on Earth.

“The reason why you don’t know about Earth is very likely because the name is different,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

After all, the name ‘earth’had only begun in recent years.

If it had been tens of thousands of years, who knew what it would have been called at that time.

“Perhaps.”Freewill nodded.

“Do you know about the immortal slaying sect?”At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly asked.

Following heart nodded and said, “I have heard of it. Rumor has it that it is a powerful sect. Their people once crossed over half of the starry sky and descended into the Holy Region.”

Qin Yu sighed and said, “It is very likely that the immortal slaying sect originated from Earth.”

“The origin of the immortal slaying sect? I have heard of it,”following heart said.

Qin Yu was delighted. He hurriedly looked at following heart and waited for his follow-up.

Freewill continued, “Rumor has it that many talents were born on that ancient star. Even great cultivators at the tribulation stage are not rare.”

Qin Yu did not dare to interrupt. He looked at Freewill eagerly.

Freewill continued, “Qin Yu, do you know what the end of cultivation is?”

Qin Yu shook his head, indicating that he did not know.

“The peak of the world is the great cultivator at the tribulation stage. Once you step into this realm, you can cross the entire universe and destroy the galaxy with a raise of Your Hand,”Freewill said.

“But in this world, a great cultivator at the tribulation stage is not the same as an immortal emperor. At most, he can only be considered a quasi-immortal emperor.”

“The true peak is to ascend to the emperor’s throne.”

At this point, Freewill looked at Qin Yu and slowly said, “The immortal slaying sect that you speak of has someone who has cultivated to the peak and ascended to the Supreme Emperor’s throne. He is also the first sect leader of the immortal slaying sect.”

“It is also because the immortal emperor realm appeared in the immortal slaying sect that the immortal slaying sect has always been at the peak. This is because they all have emperor’s blood flowing through their veins. This bloodline is destined to be extraordinary.”

Qin Yu remained silent. Regarding the name of an immortal emperor, Qin Yu had never heard of it before.

Today, after hearing Freewill’s words, he was somewhat shocked.

“Normally speaking, the birth of an immortal emperor would at least guarantee that the clan wouldn’t decline for ten thousand years.”Freewill sighed.

“It’s a pity that their peak stage is far from what we can imagine.”

Qin Yu spoke in a low voice, “Do you know anything about this immortal emperor from the immortal slaying sect?”

“Everything is just a rumor.”Freewill replied.

“I only know that at this level, he can destroy the heavens and earth with a wave of his hand. A single strand of his hair can kill a true saint. A single drop of his blood can allow a person to step into the Saint Realm.”

“As for this immortal emperor from the immortal slaying sect, his strength is unfathomable and incomparably powerful. Naturally, at that level, no one would be able to match him.”

Qin Yu remained silent. This level of cultivation was too far away from him.

In addition, even if one searched through the history of the Southern Prefecture, they wouldn’t be able to find many such characters.

To ordinary people, the tribulation stage was already the end of their cultivation.

“Besides him, has anyone else ascended the throne?”Qin Yu asked.

“I know many great cultivators at the tribulation stage. As for the throne, I don’t know the second one,”freewill said.

Then, he sighed, “After all, what I know is only the South Province. Moreover, how can I spy on people at that level?”

Seeing this, Qin Yu did not continue to ask.

He cupped his hands to follow heart and said, “Thank you, master follow heart.”

With that, Qin Yu walked to the table and picked up the book.

This time, he calmed his mind and began to read seriously. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Seeing this, follow heart did not continue to disturb him. He quietly stood up and left.

...

The Southern Region had a short period of peace, but everyone’s heart was still hanging in the air.

They knew that the strength of an elementalist was not limited to this. Once he was fully resurrected, he would definitely return to the southern region.

No one knew the level of an elementalist, but they knew in their hearts that the strength of an elementalist must have crossed the reversion void stage.

“As far as I know, there is still no existence of the reversion void stage in the southern region.”

“That’s right. I wonder if the sect leader of the Heavenly Cloud sect has stepped into this stage.”

“It has been too long since he made a move. No one knows exactly how strong he is. Moreover, even if he is no match for an elementalist, he must have some means to protect himself. At that time, we will be the ones who will be injured.”

“If we are to die, let’s all die together. There is nothing to worry about. Let’s live the rest of our lives well.”

At the border of the South Province, in a small mountain village.

The resources here were rather scarce. Usually, hardly anyone would come.

And those with some talent in the village had basically all left this place. The ones left behind were mostly the old, the weak, the sick, and the disabled.

But it was in this kind of place that a black-robed man quietly descended.

In the dark night, the picture scroll appeared in the sky and silently took their lives.

In one night, the mountain village became a ghost village.

The black-robed man put away the scroll and immediately rushed to the next place.

...

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu had been in this secret room for ten days.

After flipping through the book, Qin Yu couldn’t help but be more surprised.

Because according to the records in this book, more than ten great cultivators of the tribulation stage had been born in the South Province. Each of them was extremely powerful, and at their peak, they were not weaker than the Central Province!

However, what was strange was that the bloodlines of these people had all disappeared, and not a single bloodline remained.

“How could this be...”Qin Yu murmured softly.

Although the bloodlines of great cultivators at the Tribulation Stage were not as powerful as the emperor’s bloodline, at least they had a long history.

Cultivators with the first generation of bloodlines could easily step into the true Saint Realm!

Any one of them could make the South Province tremble!

But why did such a powerful bloodline disappear?

“Strange.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

He put away the book, turned around, and walked out of the secret room. He found Freewill and told him his doubts.

While cleaning, freewill shook his head and said, “I don’t know the reason, but none of them survived.”

“Could it be that... They all went to the Central Plains?”Qin Yu asked curiously.

“I had such doubts before, but unfortunately, I didn’t,”Freewill said.

At this point, he seemed to have remembered something. He raised his head and said, “The birthplace of these great cultivators at the tribulation stage came from the same place, which is the Eastern Wilderness.”
