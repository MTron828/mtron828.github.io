Chapter 1731: Don’t Touch My Keepsake Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

His expression changed drastically.

The power of this gust of internal qi was beyond his imagination, and it was swift!

In the blink of an eye, Chao Shou had already rushed over.

He stood in the air and looked down at Qin Yu with a toying expression.

“Qin Yu, do you know the price of fooling me?” Chao Shou said indifferently.

Seeing Chao Shou in front of him, Qin Yu’s heart thumped.

“How did you find me?” he asked with a frown.

“You want to escape from me? Do you think that’s possible?” Chao Shou laughed.

The convoy behind him saw Chao Shou and hurriedly knelt.

“Greetings, Sect Master Chao…” The group of people said in a trembling voice.

“Sect Master Chao? You’re Chao Shou?” Qin Yu’s expression changed.

“That’s right. I am Chao Shou,” Chao Shou replied indifferently.

“As expected.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

It seemed that his speculation was correct. He had been discovered when he had stepped into Pilgrimage City.

“Sect… Sect Master Chao, we don’t know him. I hope you can let us go…” the convoy behind him said in horror.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He looked at Chao Shou and said, “This matter has nothing to do with them, right?”

“Indeed, it has nothing to do with them,” Chao Shou said indifferently.

Hearing this, the convoy behind heaved a sigh of relief.

“Many thanks, Sect Master Chao!” Everyone in convoy shouted and quickly got up, planning to leave.

“Let’s go, let’s go,” the leader said in a hurry.

However, at this moment, a beam of light descended from the sky and shattered their heads!

In a short moment, everyone in convoy had turned into corpses.

At this sight, Qin Yu’s face turned white with rage.

“Chao Shou, this matter has nothing to do with them. Why did you attack them!” His eyes were wide open as he glared at Chao Shou.

“Do I need a reason to step on a few ants to death?” Chao Shou replied indifferently.

“F**k you!” Qin Yu was furious. He clenched his fists tightly, and his body glowed with a golden light. His killing intent exploded to the extreme in an instant.

Chao Shou sneered. “What? Do you want to kill me? Do you think you are a match?”

“Go to hell!” Qin Yu raised his hand and threw a Ten Thousand Spell Breaking Punch. A golden light appeared in the sky and shot straight at Chao Shou!

This was a punch filled with anger. Its power exploded to the extreme, arriving in front of Chao Shou almost instantly.

Chao Shou didn’t have time to dodge, and the punch landed solidly on his body.

His entire body was instantly smashed into the ground, and several bones were broken. A massive depression in his chest almost pierced through his body.

“Pfft!”

He stood up from the ground and spat out a mouthful of blood.

Looking at Qin Yu coldly, he said, “You truly deserve the chaotic body. You can hurt me at the mere Almighty Realm.

“Go to hell!” How could Qin Yu listen to his nonsense? The only response was a destructive fist.

Chao Shou didn’t want to waste any more time with him. He snorted coldly and took out the pearl immediately.

The pearl started to glow, and wisps of internal qi pressed down.

Almost instantly, Qin Yu was pressed to the ground as if carrying the weight of a massive mountain.

No matter how hard he tried, he could not move at all.

Even though his body was extremely tough, it was still in great pain as it was almost crushed.

Chao Shou walked up, looked down at him, and said, “You fooled and attacked me. You’ve committed a huge taboo. But don’t worry, I won’t kill you for now. Three days later, I’ll take you to Nanzhou and execute you publicly.”

Finishing, he picked up Qin Yu with one hand, turned around, and left.

Qin Yu was furious. His internal qi exploded to the extreme, but he still couldn’t move an inch.

Chao Shou brought Qin Yu back to Pilgrimage City very quickly.

In the sect, he threw Qin Yu to the ground, then raised his foot and stepped on her face.

Chao Cang, who was at the side, quickly walked over.

He lowered his head to look at Qin Yu and sneered. “Little brat, you didn’t come when I invited you that day. Do you regret it now?”

“F**k your regret!” Qin Yu cursed.

Chao Cang’s eyes narrowed, and he snickered, “You still dare to argue with me? I think you’re looking for death!”

After saying that, he clenched his fist and ruthlessly smashed it at Qin Yu.

For a time, clanging sounds could be heard. Chao Cang was also at the Reversion Void stage and was extremely powerful. Even Qin Yu’s physical body could not withstand his fist.

Soon, Qin Yu vomited blood, and a few of his bones were broken.

Chao Shou raised his palm and grabbed Qin Yu’s head with one hand. He sneered and said, “Take it easy. I will slowly torture you. When you wish you were dead, I will take you to Nanzhou.”

“I think three days should be enough, right?” he said with a half-smile.

After saying that, he exerted more and more strength in his hand. Qin Yu’s head suddenly hurt so much that it was almost crushed.

“Ah!”

Finally, Qin Yu could not help but let out a shrill scream.

“Swish!”

At this moment, a sharp blade suddenly fell from the sky and directly cut off Qin Yu’s arm!

Before he could react, the sharp blade slashed at his other arm!

“Ah!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The incredible pain made him raise his head and roar, but he had no room to resist.

“Qin Yu. Take it easy. This is only the beginning.” Chao Shou said with a cold smile.

Immediately after, he took Qin Yu to a dungeon and tied him up with a few chains, making him unable to move.

Blood flowed down Qin Yu’s arm without any signs of stopping.

Qin Yu gritted her teeth. Although losing an arm was nothing to a cultivator, he didn’t have a secret technique like the Immortal Slaying Sect. It would take a long time for him to recover.

He closed his eyes and tried to adjust his breath to restore his body. However, at this time, he felt a chill from the chain, and it hit him like lightning!

His body suddenly tensed up, and he couldn’t stop trembling.

Outside the door, Chao Shou looked at Chao Cang and said blandly, “Take everything on him. I heard that this brat has many treasures on him.”

“All right!” Chao Cang didn’t say anything but quickly walked to Qin Yu and started searching.

He pulled out Qin Yu’s Spatial Magic Artifact and other items and put them in his pocket.

Suddenly, he saw the jade pendant hanging on Qin Yu’s neck.

“Eh? What is this?” He reached out to grab the jade pendant on Qin Yu’s chest.

Qin Yu’s expression changed abruptly, and he roared angrily, “Don’t you f**king touch it!”

The pendant was a token from Yan Ruoxue. It was essential to him.

But the more he got angry, the more interested Chao Cang was.

“It is mine now.” Chao Cang reached out and grabbed Qin Yu’s jade pendant.
