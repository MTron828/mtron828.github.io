2498 Stripping the Heart of Thunder

Even if he were severely injured, his water elemental power could quickly heal his body’s injuries.

If they were to fight with the same level of combat strength, he would probably be unbeatable with this magical artifact.

Moreover, the effect of the restrained breath was also heaven-defying.

If Gu Ning had not intentionally released a wisp of Qin Yu’s internal qi, Teng Zixu probably would not have known when Qin Yu left Huaning Mountain.

Relying on the Heart of the Ocean, he could even comprehend the power of the third or fourth-level Path of Heaven. However, this was of no help to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu wanted to study the source of poison.

However, he had tried for a long time but failed to extract the terrifying poison that Gu Ning had collected. After wasting nearly three to four days, Qin Yu finally gave up.

“Regarding the source of the poison, perhaps I have to find the source of the water element to extract it?”

Qin Yu shook his head. He could ask Ji Yue later.

He would see if she had any information. There was very little information about the celestial artifact, the Heart of the Ocean.

In the past battles between the Gu family and others, Gu Ning rarely took out this celestial artifact.

Otherwise, Immortal Crane would have planned to prevent Gu Ning from going deep into the demon race’s territory.

Suddenly, Qin Yu had an idea.

In his soul, the Heart of Thunder in his divine sea at this moment, billions of wisps of soul power were closely combined with it.

This Heart of Thunder was obtained from the immortal grave in the Thunder Courtyard. That time, Dean Lei opened the path of inheritance.

Qin Yu obtained the Heart of Thunder but did not make good use of this magical artifact.

On the contrary, Lei Xin’s cultivation was tremendously affected.

Although Lei Xin could borrow the Herat of Thunder, the supporting effect was much smaller because it had been combined with Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s divine sense turned into a knife. It slowly cut open the soul connected to the Heart of Thunder.

“Hiss!”

The moment the knife of divine sense cut through, Qin Yu’s body could not help but twitch from the intense pain.

The Heart of the Ocean sensed the injury in his soul and instantly turned into light blue energy that flowed into his sea of consciousness.

As a cold energy wrapped around the cut, the wound quickly healed.

“This Heart of the Ocean is indeed effective in treating soul injuries!”

Qin Yu was overjoyed. He continued doing what he had just done.

Although erasing the imprint of the magical artifact was a little painful, it was nothing compared to the process of condensing the Soul Spirit Bead.

Knowing that the Heart of the Ocean could heal soul injuries after being cut, Qin Yu’s speed also increased tremendously.

For nearly ten days, Qin Yu put all her heart and soul into erasing the soul imprint of the Heart of Thunder.

“Boom!”

Thunder clouds rolled in the sky, and countless lightning bolts swam in the clouds near Huaning Mountain.

Wherever the lightning passed by, the air seemed to freeze. The internal qi filled with electric charges was suffocating.

All the people of Human Race Watch could feel the buzzing of electric currents in the air. It was as if countless electric snakes were winding in the sky.

The power of lightning that filled the sky suddenly condensed at one point.

Qin Yu walked down with the Heart of Thunder in his hand. He did not waste time and placed the Heart of Thunder in Lei Xin’s hand.

“Qin Yu, this Heart of Thunder is your inheritance. I can’t take it.”

Lei Xin finally understood what Qin Yu was trying to do. He shook his head and rejected.

Even if it was left behind by a senior of the Lei family, taking a junior’s magical artifact was not what he would do.

“Dean, make the best use of everything. This magical artifact can’t play its role in me. Besides, it should belong to you. Anyway, I’ve already removed all the divine sense imprints. It’s impossible to refine it again. This Heart of Thunder won’t recognize a cultivator who has already thrown it away.”

Qin Yu turned around and left directly.

“Qin Yu!”

Lei Xin shouted.

“Lei Xin, just accept it. Qin Yu is indeed right. You can put this item to good use in your hands. This little fellow, Qin Yu, is walking on the path of anomaly. It’s not of much use to him.”

Flower Granny said with a smile, sighed with emotion.

The pain of erasing this divine sense imprint was not something ordinary people could bear.

“What a brat! He didn’t even discuss it with us before doing anything.”

Tears welled up in Lei Xin’s eyes. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Qin Yu felt much more comfortable after stripping away the Heart of Thunder.

All this while, Lei Xin and Flower Granny had been thinking about him and Ruoxue. This could be taken as making up for the gratitude in his heart if this Heart of the Thunder could help the dean advance further.

Moreover, this thing belonged to the dean, to begin with.

“Ruoxue.”

Qin Yu hugged Yan Ruoxue’s slender waist from behind, his cheeks gently rubbing against Ruoxue’s fair face.

“It’s so annoying! So many people are here.”

Yan Ruoxue blushed.

Especially Jue Wu and Chang Mang were screaming at the side, which made her even more shy.

“Go!”

With a flick of her finger, Chang Mang and Jue Wu were instantly teleported a thousand meters away.

“Ruoxue, you seem to have broken through again. That power just now seems to have the power of the primordial rune.”

Qin Yu was a little surprised. Yan Ruoxue’s cultivation speed was progressing tremendously fast.

“Yes, but there’s a threshold now. The comprehension speed of a single power of the Path of Heaven is tremendously fast. However, it’s still a long way to go to continue comprehending the ultimate power of the origin, let alone breaking through to the sixth level.”

Yan Ruoxue shook her head and looked up at Qin Yu.

“If a single path is so difficult, then the path of anomaly you’re taking is even more difficult.”

Qin Yu stared at the face so close to him and could not help but kiss her.

“It’s so annoying! I’m talking to you!”

Ruoxue’s body immediately softened.

“Oh yes, I have an idea to try out, Ruoxue, but I need you by my side.”

Qin Yu laughed out loud. Seeing Ruoxue’s embarrassed and angry look, he could not help but want to tease her.

Qin Yu did not wait for Ruoxue to speak and pulled her directly into the Sumeru World.

“This is my body’s chaotic power, and this is the demonic elemental energy.”

Qin Yu combined a drop of chaotic power with the demonic elemental energy, and a terrifying explosive force instantly erupted.

“I’ve seen you use this move before. Its explosive power is indeed terrifying. Do you have any new ideas?”

Yan Ruoxue asked curiously. It was her first time seeing such a combination of powers up close.

Qin Yu nodded and said with a solemn expression.

“Previously, I tried to use the ghost race’s cultivation qi to combine them, but it didn’t seem to work. I also obtained the bone cultivation water and refined a portion of the demonic power, but it didn’t show any reaction either.”

He slowed down for a moment, and a drop of green demonic liquid appeared before him.

Following the appearance of a drop of the demon race’s elemental energy, the surrounding air seemed to have become heavy and chilly.
