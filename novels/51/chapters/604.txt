Chapter 605: The Great Battle! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The explosive sounds spread throughout the entire hall!

Qin Yu hurriedly lowered his head to look at his wrist. As expected, the bracelet had already turned into pieces!

“The bracelet... finally broke!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but mutter in a low voice, then he felt a sense of ecstasy!

Meanwhile, He Teng’s expression changed slightly, and the hand that had just stretched out involuntarily retracted.

“It actually shattered at this time...” Yan Guiyi’s brows were tightly knitted together. His expression was extremely unsightly.

The things had yet to be divided, but the bracelet had already shattered. For Yan Guiyi, this wasn’t good news.

“He Teng, without the suppression of this bracelet, do you have the ability to go against me?” Qin Yu said coldly.

He Teng’s expression changed slightly. He snorted lightly and said, “Qin Yu, don’t think that I’m afraid of you. So what if I don’t have this bracelet? I’m not afraid of you!”

“Is that so?!” Qin Yu shouted loudly. His voice shook the entire hall and caused it to buzz!

Following that, Qin Yu took a step forward. In an instant, a terrifying aura swept through the entire hall!

He Teng’s expression was extremely unsightly. He knew very well that if it wasn’t for the suppression of this bracelet, he wouldn’t be a match for Qin Yu at all!

Thinking of this, He Teng couldn’t help but look at Yan Guiyi.

But Yan Guiyi didn’t say anything.

“D*mn it.” He Teng gritted his teeth.

Now that things had come to this, he had no other choice. He could only take large strides forward and shout angrily, “Qin Yu, don’t be so arrogant. Do you really think that I, He Teng, am afraid of you?!”

Before he could finish his words, He Teng used the same trick again. He once again activated the black energy around him and rushed towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu sneered. “The same technique will be useless after two tries.”

The black energy once again transformed into Yan Ruoxue’s appearance and closed in on Qin Yu.

However, this time, Qin Yu closed his eyes!

His powerful divine sense covered the entire Immortal Slaying Sect!

With this divine sense, Qin Yu was able to figure out all of He Teng’s movements!

“Boom!”

As the black energy rushed over, Qin Yu punched out, piercing through that mass of energy!

He Teng immediately spat out a mouthful of blood, and his body couldn’t help but retreat backwards.

“This time, I’ll see who else can save you!” Qin Yu shouted loudly.

He didn’t give He Teng the slightest chance. His body transformed into a golden light and instantly arrived in front of He Teng.

“Boom!”

A golden light appeared and the terrifying Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist smashed down! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He Teng’s expression changed drastically. He hurriedly activated the black energy around him to react.

However, Qin Yu’s power was too strong. It pierced through his black energy and headed straight for He Teng’s body!

“Pfft!”

After He Teng’s chest took this punch, his body retreated continuously!

If not for the buffering of this black energy, this punch might have taken He Teng’s life!

He Teng’s face was pale. He struggled to stand up from the ground, and his hands quickly slid in the air.

The black energy once again turned into small balls!

Each small ball contained an extremely terrifying power!

On the island, He Teng had relied on this technique to shatter Qin Yu’s body!

“It’s this technique again?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer when he saw this.

“Didn’t I tell you that the same technique won’t work the second time?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said.

He Teng didn’t pay any attention to it. He clenched his teeth and his internal qi boiled!

The small black balls gathered around his body one after another.

A terrifying pressure immediately spread out.

Even though they were far away, they could feel the destructive energy contained in the small ball!

He Teng stared at Qin Yu and snorted coldly. “Qin Yu, no matter what price I have to pay, I will kill you!”

Qin Yu’s expression was solemn as he looked coldly at He Teng in the distance.

Following He Teng’s furious roar, the black ball in his hand immediately smashed towards Qin Yu!

“Boom!”

A huge explosion resounded throughout the entire hall!

Thick smoke rose up in all directions, as if a huge bomb had exploded at this moment!

A terrifying energy rippled out in all directions, and everyone was forced back several steps by this energy!

Even Yan Guiyi’s face flashed with a trace of surprise!

The corpses under Qin Yu’s feet turned into ashes, and a huge pit that was dozens of meters deep appeared in front of everyone!

The smoke and dust slowly dispersed, and everyone’s eyes were fixed on the direction of the huge pit.

“Huh? He’s not dead?”

Soon, someone noticed Qin Yu’s figure!

A small hill in front of him was shining and blocking Qin Yu behind it!

Even so, Qin Yu’s clothes were ragged, and there were many bloody marks on his body!

“A Magic Artifact?” Yan Guiyi narrowed his eyes and frowned slightly.

“What kind of Magic Artifact is this? How could it block such a terrifying attack?”

He Teng’s expression was even uglier! This attack had exhausted all of his energy. If he couldn’t kill Qin Yu, then he would be the one to die!

Qin Yu put away the Venerable Fifth Mountain and wiped the bloody marks on his body. He couldn’t help but say coldly, “If it weren’t for the Venerable Fifth Mountain, this spell would have brought me a lot of trouble.”

He Teng didn’t say anything. He panted heavily, and his eyes were full of fear.

Qin Yu tidied his clothes and walked toward He Teng step by step.

“He Teng, what other tricks do you have? Just use them,” Qin Yu said as he walked.

That powerful pressure made He Teng’s body twitch, and his face was full of fear.

“Do you want to use your Spatial Magic Artifact?” Qin Yu said with narrowed eyes.

He waved his big hand and trapped He Teng on the spot.

That small space seemed to be confined.

“It seems that you don’t have any other tricks,” Qin Yu sneered.

“He Teng, then you can go to h*ll!”

Accompanied by Qin Yu’s angry roar, Qin Yu clenched his golden fist and quickly rushed toward He Teng!

“Stop!”

At this critical moment, Yan Guiyi finally planned to make a move!

His figure flashed explosively as he rushed towards He Teng.

Qin Yu glanced at him coldly and said, “Yan Guiyi, you can’t save him!”

The terrifying golden light arrived beside He Teng in the blink of an eye!

Yan Guiyi was obviously too late. He gritted his teeth and flipped his palm. A black-gold ball suddenly shot out!

These black-gold balls were the two that Yan Guiyi played with every day!

“Clang!”

The black-gold ball blocked in front of He Teng and collided with Qin Yu’s fist!

Qin Yu’s fist immediately felt waves of pain, and the golden light was shattered by the black-gold ball!

He Teng, who had been saved, was immediately drenched in sweat, and his legs went weak.

Yan Guiyi took the opportunity to rush to He Teng.

He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “I asked you to stop. Can’t you hear me?”
