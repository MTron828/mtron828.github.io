Chapter 1288: Chapter 1288, the death of the team leader 

Jin Lun glanced at the medicine bag in Ling Yun’s hand and said coldly, “Do you want me to take the blame? If they find out that I killed the team leader, Will They believe me?”

Ling Yun frowned slightly and said, “What else? Do You Want Me to go? What else do I Need You For?”

Jin Lun laughed coldly and said, “Do you think I’m an idiot? After achieving your goal, you don’t care about anything anymore?”

“Do you know who you’re talking to?”Ling Yun narrowed his eyes.

“I don’t care who you are. I’m just cooperating with you, not your subordinate,”Jin Lun said coldly.

The atmosphere instantly froze. The two of them looked at each other as if they were about to break down at any moment.

At this moment, Zhong Wu hurriedly tried to smooth things over. “Isn’t that simple? Can’t you just find someone to take the blame? After all, you have so many subordinates.”

“No, you can’t use my people.”Jin Lun shook his head.

“Otherwise, they will definitely suspect me.”

Ling Yun was completely enraged when he heard this.

He stood up and said, “This won’t do either. Why Don’t You Die?”

“Then, there’s no need to talk about it.”Jin Lun snorted coldly and turned to leave.

Zhong Wu hurriedly stopped Jin Lun and said helplessly, “How about this, leave this matter to me. I’ll find someone to take the blame for you, Alright?”

Jin Lun stopped in his tracks. He looked at Ling Yun as if he was waiting for his opinion.

“Alright, as long as you can hand Qin Yu over to me, I don’t care what you guys do,”Ling Yun said coldly.

Jin Lun didn’t say anything else.

He took the medicine bag and was about to leave.

“Wait for the news,”Jin Lun said before ignoring Ling Yun.

Ling Yun’s expression turned even colder as he watched Jin Lun leave.

“This kid isn’t easy to control,”Ling Yun said in a low voice.

“Our goal isn’t to control the hunter organization, but to get rid of Qin Yu,”the person beside him reminded.

Even so, Ling Yun was still a little unhappy.

...

The next day.

Zhong Wu found a scapegoat.

“I’ve already found the person. I’ll leave the rest to you,”zhong wu said to Jin Lun.

Jin Lun looked at the chicken soup in front of him and said, “Alright, I’ll go look for the team leader now. You have to promise to bring the scapegoat here at the first possible moment.”

“Understood,”zhong wu said with a smile.

Jin Lun didn’t say anything else. He picked up the chicken soup and walked towards the team leader’s office.

These few days, the team leader had been extremely busy because of the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s matters. He was extremely experienced.

Seeing Jin Lun Walk in, the team leader waved his hand and said, “Jin Lun, why are you here?”

Jin Lun carried the chicken soup and walked to the opposite side of the team leader.

He placed the chicken soup in front of the team leader and said, “Team leader, why do you have to put in so much effort for Qin Yu?”

The team leader sighed and said, “He is one of us after all. I naturally have to protect him.”

Jin Lun said with a cold face, “Is it worth it to pay such a big price?”

The price he mentioned was obviously referring to the statement.

Unfortunately, the team leader did not know about it.

“No matter which Hunter is in trouble, I have to protect him. If it is you, I will also protect you.”The team leader rubbed his forehead and said.

Jin Lun frowned slightly. He took a look at the chicken soup, and a hint of conflict flashed in his eyes.

However, this hint of conflict only lasted for a short while, and soon he returned to his icy cold state.

“This is a pheasant that my men caught to treat my injuries. Drink it while it’s hot.”Jin Lun stood up and said.

The team leader nodded and said, “Thank you. Leave it there for now.”

Jin Lun did not say anything. He quickly got up and left the office.

However, he did not go far. Instead, he waited quietly nearby.

In the office.

The team leader flipped through the documents in his hand and picked up the chicken soup beside him.

He did not think too much about it. It was even more impossible for him to think that Jin Lun wanted to harm him.

A bowl of chicken soup was poured into his mouth.

As the chicken soup was poured into his stomach, the team leader soon felt that something was wrong.

The strength in his body seemed to be losing rapidly, and everything in front of him began to spin.

“Not good, the chicken soup is poisonous...”the team leader quickly understood something!

At this moment, Jin Lun pushed the door open and entered.

His huge body walked toward the team leader step by step.

At the same time, he was holding a long saber in his hand.

“Jin Lun, why... Why are you doing this? !”The group leader tried his best to spit out these words.

Jin Lun said coldly, “I’m sorry. In order to get to the top, I can only sacrifice you.”

The group leader’s expression changed drastically. He wanted to take out the bone staff, but it was too late.

This Jin Lun held the steel saber in his hand and sliced through the group leader’s neck.

The team leader’s body fell heavily, and his primordial spirit floated out.

But how could the golden wheel give him the chance? He immediately waved his hand and crushed the team leader’s primordial spirit.

The team leader was dead!

At this moment, the door was pushed open.

Zhong Wu walked in with a young hunter.

When the young hunter saw the scene in front of him, his expression changed drastically!

“Team... team leader? Jin Lun, you killed the team leader? !”The Hunter said with a horrified expression.

Jin Lun’s expression was extremely calm. He glanced at Zhong wu and said coldly, “Follow the plan.”

“What plan? Jin Lun, what are you talking about?”

But Zhong Wu’s words made Jin Lun Freeze on the spot.

“Zhong Wu, what do you mean?”Jin Lun narrowed his eyes as if he had already sensed that something was wrong.

Zhong Wu pretended to be angry and said, “Jin Lun, you bastard, you actually killed the team leader? !”

“You F * cking tricked me? !”Jin Lun reacted. He glared at Zhong Wu and gritted his teeth, “You F * cking dare to trick me?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Who tricked you? You Bastard, you actually killed the team leader, you will die a horrible death!”Zhong Wu pretended to be sorrowful and said.

Then, he shouted to the outside, “Everyone, come quickly! Jin Lun, kill the Leader!”

“Zhong Wu, I will kill you!”Jin Lun was furious. He clenched his fist and rushed to Zhong Wu.

However, Jin Lun’s injuries were not healed yet. He could not catch Zhong Wu at all.

“Come quickly! Jin Lun, kill the Leader!”Zhong Wu was still shouting crazily.
