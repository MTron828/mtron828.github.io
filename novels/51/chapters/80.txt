Chapter 81: Shen Yun Apologizes Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Even though that was the case, Zhao Gang was still afraid.

To Zhao Gang, it was undoubtedly a huge risk to touch someone whose status was far higher than his.

“If we are discovered, then... we would be dead meat...” Zhao Gang’s face was filled with fear.

Shen Tian snorted and said, “If you want to be a big shot, how can you not take risks? If you want to live like this for the rest of your life, you can refuse.”

After saying that, Shen Tian turned his head to the side and didn’t say anything else.

Zhao Gang sat there for a long time without saying anything.

After a long time, Zhao Gang looked at Shen Tian and said, “Let me think about it. I’ll give you my decision tomorrow.”

“Okay.” Shen Tian nodded. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Then, he said with a smile, “There aren’t many opportunities in life. You have to consider it carefully.”

“I know.” Zhao Gang nodded and then left the bar.

Shen Tian sneered.

He believed that Zhao Gang would definitely agree, because a greedy person like Zhao Gang definitely wouldn’t be able to resist the temptation.

The greed of human nature was the biggest loophole to be exploited.

Shen Tian’s idea was very simple. If he found someone to kidnap Yan Ruoxue, then the Yan family would be furious and would definitely vent their anger on Qin Yu.

Even if Qin Yu was lucky enough to obtain the Yan family’s forgiveness, Yan Ruoxue would definitely be brought back to Jingdu.

At that time, wouldn’t Qin Yu be a piece of cake for him to deal with?

Even if the Yan family really found out, the Shen family could still deny it and blame everything on Zhao Gang.

“I’m really a genius!” Shen Tian couldn’t help but laugh smugly.

...

The next day, Qin Yu rushed back to Jiangcheng from the provincial capital.

This time, his harvest was quite bountiful. The herbs given by Wei Jiang and the one given by Zheng Mingshuo were enough for Qin Yu to advance to the Foundation Establishment Stage.

“I wonder how long it will take for me to advance to the Foundation Establishment Stage from the Qi Refining Stage,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Therefore, before that, Qin Yu had to make arrangements in advance.

He put away the herbs for the time being and then planned to pick the prime spot.

“It would be great if I could stay in Shen Tian’s villa,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

The spiritual energy environment there was the best Qin Yu had ever seen. Unfortunately, the relationship between the two made it impossible for Qin Yu to stay there.

At this moment, a Land Rover suddenly drove in from outside the door.

The car stopped in front of Qin Yu, and then a man in a black suit walked out.

“Is Mr. Qin at home?” The man in the black suit stood at the door and asked.

Qin Yu frowned. He walked forward and said, “I am. What do you want?”

The man in the black suit said politely, “Mr. Wu wants to invite you to dinner tonight. I wonder if you are free.”

“Mr. Wu? Uncle Wu?” Qin Yu suddenly remembered him.

Since the last incident, the two of them hadn’t crossed any paths.

“Could it be that he’s here for the Shen Family?” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Uncle Wu and the Yan family had a good relationship, plus Qin Yu had already snubbed him last time.

Therefore, after thinking about it, Qin Yu decided to agree to it for Yan Ruoxue’s sake.

“Okay, tell me the time and place,” Qin Yu said.

The man in the black suit hurriedly said, “It’s tonight at eight o’clock, at the Xiaojiang Fishing Village.”

“Okay, I’ll definitely be there on time,” Qin Yu said.

After the man in the black suit left, Yao Qing walked forward quickly.

“Mr. Qin, Mr. Wu and Shen Yun are good friends. I’m afraid it’s a trap,” Yao Qing warned him.

Qin Yu smiled slightly and said, “It’s okay. I believe they won’t be able to do anything to me.”

Yao Qing wanted to say something, but was stopped by Qin Yu with a wave of his hand.

On the other hand, Zhao Gang and Su Yan were lying on the bed. Zhao Gang was smoking non-stop with a frown.

“Honey, what’s wrong?” Su Yan laid on Zhao Gang’s body and said in a sweet voice.

Looking at Su Yan, Zhao Gang felt an inexplicable sense of annoyance.

He was feeling more and more regretful that he married such a shallow and vain woman.

“No, I can’t accept the status quo!” Zhao Gang made up his mind and threw the cigarette butt in his hand on the ground. Then, he picked up his phone and ran to the balcony.

He made a call to Shen Tian.

After the call was connected, Zhao Gang said on the phone, “Mr. Shen, I agree.”

On the other end, Shen Tian burst into laughter and said, “I knew you would make the right choice.”

Zhao Gang said in a sullen voice, “Mr. Shen, I have a few conditions.”

“Go ahead,” Shen Tian agreed.

“If we succeed, the Zhao family will have a deep business cooperation with the Shen family,” Zhao Gang said.

Shen Tian smiled nonchalantly and said, “Of course, there’s no problem with that. Don’t worry, My Shen family definitely won’t mistreat you.”

Zhao Gang continued, “If the matter is exposed, you have to prepare 100 million in cash for me and guarantee my safe departure.”

“Hahaha, no problem!” Shen Tian laughed out loud. “But no one can find out that this has anything to do with the Shen family. Otherwise, you know the consequences.”

“Okay.” Zhao Gang nodded and agreed.

After hanging up the phone, Shen Tian couldn’t help but sneer.

If this matter got exposed, Zhao Gang wanted him to give me cash? He might as well wait for his death! He would have disassociated himself long before that!

“Just wait and see. There will be drama.” Shen Tian smiled smugly.

...

At night, Qin Yu prepared a simple gift and rushed to Xiaojiang Fishing Village.

There was already some waiting at the entrance of Xiaojiang Fishing Village. As soon as he saw Qin Yu, he quickly walked forward and said, “Mr. Wu has been waiting for you for a long time.”

Qin Yu nodded. He followed behind the receptionist and entered the private room.

“This is the place. Mr. Qin, please come in,” the receptionist said politely.

Qin Yu glanced around and made sure that there was no danger before pushing open the door and entering.

The moment the door opened, Qin Yu’s expression turned cold.

“As expected,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Then, Qin Yu looked at Uncle Wu and said, “Uncle Wu, if you want to have dinner with me, I’m very happy. If you have ulterior motives, then I’m sorry, but I won’t accompany you.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around to leave.

Uncle Wu hurriedly shouted, “Qin Yu, don’t be so impatient. Just do this for my sake, okay?”

Qin Yu stopped and looked at Uncle Wu. He said with a nonchalant smile, “Uncle Wu, have you forgotten what you said? You said that the Shen family won’t let me off the hook. What do you mean by doing this now?”

Uncle Wu couldn’t help but blush. How could he have expected that the Shen family wasn’t a match for Qin Yu?

“Qin Yu, there are no eternal enemies, only eternal interests,” Shen Yun finally said.

He stood up and said, “I was wrong for what happened before. This time, I invited Uncle Wu to set up this meeting to apologize to you!”

“Apologize to me?” Qin Yu scratched his ears, as if he couldn’t believe what he was hearing.

Uncle Wu waved his hand and said, “Have a seat. Have a seat.”
