2246 The Demonic Egg Trembles

The enormous cosmic form appeared and glared at the surrounding cultivators.

“Wu Feng, do you want to give it a try?” Qin Yu looked indifferent and asked coldly.

Wu Feng stared at Qin Yu coldly and left after a long time.

He could not gauge Qin Yu’s current condition. In this purgatory, injuries were equivalent to death. The Edgeless Team had existed for so many years because of his cautiousness, which was why he did not dare to take the risk.

“Wu Feng, that kid has definitely stretched to his limit. Why don’t we take this opportunity to kill him?”

Xing Mou looked reluctant.

“That Little Lolita is not simple. Let me ask you. If it were you, could you resist the slash from Xi Menn?”

Xing Mou was a little unconvinced, but in the end, he shook her head dejectedly.

“We don’t know his trump Card, and we have more important things to do.”

Wu Feng said indifferently.

“Did I let you guys go?”

Jue Wu stood before them with a furious expression. The terrifying aura from her body enveloped the three of them. The internal qi of a fierce beast caused Wu Feng’s expression to change slightly.

“Forget it, Jue Wu.”

Qin Yu said indifferently.

“Hmph! I’ll let you off!”

Jue Wu jumped back to Qin Yu’s side.

“Take me back to Solitary Cloud City. Quick!”

Qin Yu forcefully swallowed the blood that had reached his throat and transmitted a message to Jue Wu.

“Alright.”

Jue Wu understood Qin Yu’s situation at this moment. She turned around and pulled Qin Yu along as they rushed toward Solitary Cloud City.

The cultivators in the surroundings had different expressions, but the attack between Qin Yu and Xi Menn was too shocking.

Even if some people had ill intentions, they ultimately dared not make a move.

“That was the netherworld cultivation method just now. Why didn’t you make a move?”

Uncle Ling asked in surprise.

The evil exterminator’s family members were killed by demonic beasts. He thus hated demonic beasts and demonic cultivators so much.

Countless demonic cultivators and demonic beasts died under his sword in purgatory, and he had even fought with the members of the netherworld before.

The evil exterminator’s expression did not change. He did not answer Uncle Ling.

“Pfft!”

After walking for a long distance, Qin Yu finally could not hold it in anymore. A large mouthful of blood directly sprayed onto Jue Wu’s clothes.

“Qin Yu, are you okay? Don’t die, boohoo! I’ve just got here. No one will bring me around if you die!”

Jue Wu started to cry.

“You jinx! You’re the one who’s dead.”

Qin Yu said weakly. His internal qi depleted to the extreme.

He had many questions at this moment, but he could not ask a single one.

Qin Yu only fainted when he arrived at Solitary Cloud City and went to Sumeru Space with Jue Wu.

“Qin Yu, Qin Yu, don’t die! D*mn it, I’ve just arrived, and you’re going to die?”

Jue Wu burst into tears. She grabbed Qin Yu’s clothes and gave him two slaps.

“Ahem, Qin Yu should be fine. But if you continue to beat him up, I’m afraid something will happen.”

The man with the mustache coughed a few times.

“F*ck, the man with the mustache? Where is this place?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Jue Wu was shocked as if she did not expect the man with the mustache to be there.

“My friend, you’re a little disrespectful.”

The man with the mustache was speechless.

All of a sudden, an obscure internal qi fluctuated in the space.

Qin Yu was unconscious, but the Soul Torment Mind Technique actually circulated on its own at this moment. The familiar sinister fluctuation made the man with the mustache shiver.

“F*ck, it’s that netherworld cultivation method again. That Qin Yu won’t come out again later, right?”

The dark Qin Yu almost wiped them out last time, and the man with the mustache still had a lingering fear.

“Qin Yu’s divine sense is too severely injured and even life-threatening. The netherworld cultivation method should be the cultivation technique that can best repair his divine sense, so his body automatically circulated the Meridian Circulation Technique.”

Elder Guai had lived for more than ten thousand years. Even though he had lost a lot of his strength now, his eyesight was still profound.

All the demonic beast souls in Qin Yu’s body floated up one by one. The souls of the three Blood Sect elders he had killed also appeared in his sea of consciousness.

“Quickly let me go if you know what’s good for you. Otherwise, my Blood Sect will definitely not let you off.”

“I may spare your life. Quickly let me off.”

Several people eagerly called out, vying with each other to speak first.

“Crunch!”

Qin Yu devoured their souls one after another like apples, repairing the injuries of his soul.

“F*ck, you devoured so many souls?”

The man with the mustache gasped. Even though he was experienced and knowledgeable, he had never seen such a situation.

All these were genuine True Saint Realm souls, and he devoured the ten or so souls like apples.

He had seen many evil cultivators devour souls, but it would take several years to refine a soul of the same realm.

Only after the soul was completely refined could he absorb the power of the soul in peace.

Otherwise, the absorbed soul would easily cause trouble. Once he transcended the tribulation, his inner demon would fiercely backslash.

The entire Sumeru Realm became gloomy. When the netherworld cultivation method was activated, the gloomy aura was particularly obvious.

“Sister, we’re scared!”

Little Fatty and Little Daffodil hugged Jue Wu’s legs.

“Eh, why are there two children? Qin Yu, did you give birth to babies?”

Jue Wu’s face was filled with anger, and it turned incredibly red.

“They’re not Qin Yu’s children. They are two demons of flower!”

The man with the mustache was so angry. What was this Little Lolita thinking?

“Eh, I think so. They’re so cute. Kiss Sister.”

Jue Wu took a closer look. They were indeed two demons of the flower. She immediately rubbed against the two’s chubby faces.

“Brother is injured again.”

Little Daffodil pouted.

Jue Wu’s eyes reddened. With just a few words, she knew Qin Yu did not have it easy in the past 70 to 80 years.

“Yeah, he worked too hard.”

Elder Guai sighed and said.

“This kid could even resist a blow from Xi Menn. You must know that Xi Menn is a genius of his generation, feared by the nine great aristocratic families from 800 years ago. I was about to run away just now.”

The man with the mustache looked at Qin Yu with an inexplicable gaze.

“That sword could cut through the world. As expected of that person’s son!”

Elder Guai’s face was full of praise.

Jue Wu did not think much. She only looked at Qin Yu with heartache.

Why was it so difficult in the Holy Region, and why was it also so difficult in a galaxy so far away from the Holy Region?

“You scoundrel! Why did you always end up in such dire straits? Nothing must happen to you. Did you hear me!”

Jue Wu stared at Qin Yu fiercely.

In Qin Yu’s divine sense, the originally unified divine sense figurine suddenly slowly separated.

Under the influence of the Soul Torment Mind Technique, a crack slowly split in the middle of his divine sense and then slowly split into a new half.

Jue Wu suddenly felt her storage space become restless. She checked it and found the demonic egg she had obtained earlier was trembling.

Jue Wu curiously took it out, and the demonic egg shook violently and left her palm.

It was slowly leaning toward Qin Yu’s head, greedily absorbing the internal qi emitted by the Soul Torment Mind Technique.

“What’s going on?”

Jue Wu was curious, too.
