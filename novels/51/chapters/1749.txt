1750 He Teng’s Ambitions

In a certain room, Qin Yu was lying motionless on the bed, and his breath was a little dispirited.

Peng Liu knew that he was just a small character, so he simply hid, afraid that he would be affected if he stayed with Qin Yu.

At this moment, Yong Ji was standing in front of Qin Yu, looking at him coldly.

“I’m both happy and sad to see you like this.” Yong Ji said indifferently.

“I thought I could kill you fair and square. I didn’t expect this to be the end.”

As he spoke, a sharp blade appeared in Yong Ji’s hand.

He planned to use this sharp blade to cut off Qin Yu’s head!

“I didn’t expect to compete with a junior like you. How embarrassing.” Yong Ji said coldly.

“But it doesn’t matter. Yuan Xiu is right. Only the living are the strongest!”

As he spoke, the sharp blade in Yong Ji’s hand was aimed at Qin Yu’s neck!

At this moment, a white light flashed past and blocked Qin Yu’s path!

The huge collision force sent Yong Ji flying!

Yong Ji frowned. He looked up and saw He Teng holding onto the White Bone Club in his hand with difficulty.

It was clear that the collision had a huge impact on him.

“What are you doing?” Yong Ji said coldly.

“You can’t kill him,” He Teng said with squinted eyes.

“I can’t kill him?” Yong Ji’s eyes narrowed slightly, then he said coldly, “You really want to save him! tell me, what is your relationship with him!”

He Teng held the White Bone Club and said in a deep voice, “I need his body, so you can’t kill him.”

“You need his body?” Yong Ji laughed coldly.

“After I kill him, I’ll give you his body.”

After saying that, Yong Ji planned to attack again.

“No!”

But at this moment, He Teng chided.

“What do you want?!” Yong Ji said coldly.

He Teng’s eyes narrowed slightly. He grinned and said, “I want to defeat him with my own hands.”

“Hahahahahaha!” as soon as he said this, Yong Ji couldn’t help but laugh.

“He Teng, is there something wrong with your brain? To defeat him with your own hands? Do you think you have the ability to do so?” Yong Ji ridiculed him without mercy.

“Moreover, so what if you personally defeated him? Tsk tsk, He Teng, I really didn’t expect you to be such an ambitious person.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Facing Yong Ji’s mockery, He Teng didn’t waste any words. He stood in front of Qin Yu and said in a dark voice, “I hate him more than any of you. I can’t wait to tear him into pieces! But... I must defeat him with my own hands. If I can’t kill him, I will never be able to vindicate my dao.”

“Vindicate your dao?” The smile on Yong Ji’s face grew wider.

He said sarcastically, “He Teng, you don’t think you have the chance to become a True Saint, do you? Or to conquer the entire universe? Do you think you can enter the Tribulation Stage?”

“I thought you were an extremely shrewd person, but it seems like you’re actually so childish today!”

“I’m fundamentally different from you maggots,” He Teng said with a faint smile. “I did want Qin Yu to die in the past. As long as he’s dead, I’ll still be the so-called number one in the Central Plains.”

“However, after I entered the Holy Region, I discovered that there are many powerful experts. Even if I kill Qin Yu, there will still be Wang Yu, Sun Yu, and Li Yu! There’s no point in doing so.”

“As for your sarcasm, I don’t care at all. How would someone like you know my ambition? Tribulation Stage? What is that?”

“What I want is to become a Supreme Emperor! I want to become the strongest person in this world! I want to step on Qin Yu and enter a no man’s land!”

Hearing He Teng’s words, Yong Ji was dumbfounded.

However, he soon sneered.

“Such a childish person, I really envy you.” Yong Ji said with squinted eyes.

“Qin Yu must die today. You can’t stop me.”

He Teng reached out and grabbed the White Bone Club. Then, he said coldly, “Then you can come and try.”

“Do you think you’re invincible just because you’re using this White Bone Club?” Yong Ji shouted.

“So what if you can stop me? If Yuan Xiu finds out, you’ll still die!”

“I believe that you won’t do that, otherwise...” He Teng said gloomily. “You’ll definitely die a terrible death...”

At this moment, He Teng’s face was filled with eeriness. The coldness he gave off was even more terrifying.

It wasn’t an overstatement to say that the current He Teng was like a messenger from hell, causing people to be instinctively afraid!

“Detestable...” Yong Ji was extremely unwilling. Qin Yu was clearly lying in front of him. If he didn’t kill him, how could he bear it?

Just as the two of them were in a deadlock, two powerful auras quickly approached!

He Teng and Yong Ji instantly sensed these two auras. Without thinking, they were definitely Wen Wanchong and Qu Zhu!

“I’ll get even with you in the future!” Yong Ji said coldly.

After saying that, Yong Ji turned around and walked towards Yuan Xiu.

He Teng, on the other hand, looked down at Qin Yu in front of him. He said sinisterly, “Qin Yu, I will kill you with my own hands and cut you into pieces! What kind of bullsh*t physique is this? I’ll crush you one by one! I’ll let you all know that man can conquer nature!”

He Teng didn’t stay any longer and immediately headed in the direction of Yuan Xiu.

At this moment, Yuan Xiu pointed his ice-cold blade at Xiao Sheng.

“Xiao Sheng, after I kill you, no one will be able to stop me!” Yuan Xiu seemed to be extremely crazy!

“Boom!”

However, at this moment, a strong force was directed at Yuan Xiu’s back!

Yuan Xiu snorted coldly. He immediately turned around and welcomed the attack with his large hand!

Clang! Clang!

The terrifying collision caused the Divine Capital City to collapse in an instant!

That force was also directly dispersed by Yuan Xiu’s palm!

He followed his gaze and saw Wen Wanchong rushing over!

He glared at Yuan Xiu and shouted, “You despicable man! You actually launched a sneak attack in the middle of the night, f*ck you!”

Yuan Xiu sneered and said, “Wen Wanchong? Why are you alone? Where’s that Qu Zhu?”

“I’m more than enough to kill you!” Wen Wanchong cursed.

“I think you’re looking for death!”

Yuan Xiu didn’t want to waste any more time. He burst forth and instantly appeared in front of Wen Wanchong!

In his hand, there was a terrifying force that was approaching Wen Wanchong’s heart!

“Ah!”

“Die!” Wen Wanchong roared and his body emitted rays of light. He clenched his fist and met Yuan Xiu’s palm!

“Boom!”

Wen Wanchong took a few steps back from the impact, and his palm was bleeding, even his bones were exposed!

Yuan Xiu did not stop there. He took out his gigantic ax and swung it at Wen Wanchong!

The radiance that reached the heavens drowned everything. The gigantic ax had the power to split the heavens and earth as it slashed towards Wen Wanchong!
