2363 The Ji Family’s Holy Son

“This kid has cultivated the Glazed Holy Body. Achieving such accomplishments at such a young age, he might become a rising star in this chaotic world if he can survive.”

From the first time they met when he was weak to when they entered the Ghost Mansion Mystic Realm together and now. They met three times.

Each time they met, his strength seemed to have a terrifying increase.

Right now, in the face of him, he did not even have the chance to attack him.

…

In the Solitary Cloud City, a group sat in the Moon Listening Pavilion.

This time, there were even more people in the main hall of the Moon Listening Pavilion. After the previous defeat, the Holy Region sent another group of people over.

A young man with a youthful appearance stood in the middle. He was the Holy Son of the Ji family, Ji Ao.

“According to the Ji family’s elder’s deduction, the Golden Path of Heaven Qi is about to descend, and all the Path of Heaven suppressions are about to disappear. Many hidden mighty realm cultivators might appear in purgatory, so the higher-ups have agreed to Hua Tian’s conditions and asked him to give us Qin Yu’s coordinates.”

After Ji Ao arrived at the Holy Region, he immediately gathered people for a discussion.

“The Five Emperor Coins are the Ji family’s supreme treasure. Are we really going to give it to this monk? This supreme treasure is an extremely precious existence even for our nine families.” Ni Wuxiao seemed to be dissatisfied with this decision. Even if the nine families were to divide it equally, it would still be an enormous expense.

“The secrets of the Five Emperor Coins aren’t something Monk Hua Tian can understand. Only the people in my family can activate such a treasure. Once we settle Qin Yu’s matter, we’ll naturally find him to get the Five Emperor Coins back.”

Ji Ao looked calm as if he had already planned this.

“But even if we can find Qin Yu, and if he’s recovered, we can’t do anything to him. He will likely escape under the siege with his current strength unless we take absolute measures. Are we going to use the life of another Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivator to attack him?”

Yan Yunfan felt a headache when he thought of Qin Yu’s strength. He did not expect the foolproof arrangement earlier to be broken by Xi Menn’s forced tribulation.

“Don’t worry. The restriction is made from a wisp of the Immortal Emperor’s will. There are ten wisps of will in that little girl’s body, and the Ji family’s bloodline can detonate that will. What we need to do now is to capture Ji Yue without hurting her. I wonder if the Jee family’s ancestor has set up the Xuanyuan Sword. It might require Ji Yue’s bloodline to obtain it.”

Ji Ao placed his hands on his knees and explained it to the core members of the Holy Region in a calm voice.

The Ji family of the nine great aristocratic families had the longest history, and their core members usually would not appear.

Sending the Holy Son here this time meant they took this matter seriously.

“Ten wisps of will. When the restriction of the Immortal Emperor’s will explodes, Qin Yu will surely die!”

Yao Xi’s face showed a look of ecstasy. He no longer hoped to be able to kill Qin Yu on his own. He would be satisfied if Qin Yu could die.

“The Yun family has sent someone to deliver the Traversing Divine Map. Once Hua Tian sends me the location, I can go directly to Qin Yu’s vicinity. I’ll control my power well so that the Immortal Emperor’s will only explode in his sea of consciousness and won’t hurt Ji Yue.”

Qin Yu sat cross-legged and began to circulate his Traceless Immortal Scripture.

He formed a hand seal with one hand, and countless strands of chaotic qi disappeared into the sky.

A giant compass slowly formed. It was the Way of Deduction in the Traceless Immortal Scripture.

The Five Element and Eight Trigram Technique.

Qin Yu slowly raised his head and looked at the faint light released by the compass. Those lights contained countless pieces of information.

Similar to the Great Expansion Divine Technique, this technique was a prediction and deduction technique.

He put all the relevant information in his divine sense into the compass and then used the technique to deduce.

Qin Yu’s divine sense was consumed at a terrifying speed. Fortunately, his current power of divine sense was incomparably vigorous.

In the world of his desolate divine eye, an exceptionally dim power of rules locked onto his soul like a chain. He would not have noticed it even with his desolate divine eye if his Five Element Eight Trigram Technique had not deduced the abnormality.

“This is… the power of Hua Tian’s Great Expansion Divine Technique?”

Qin Yu felt the power connecting to his soul power, and his expression immediately turned incomparably ugly.

It seemed he was not inadvertently tracked down by the people of the Holy Region.

He had traveled through hundreds of spatial planes so no one could track him. However, that divine sense restriction had been restless as if someone had tried to detonate him. Now, it seemed that his position had been locked long ago.

His palm gently touched the power of rules. Light flashed in his hand, but he failed to display the power of rules.

Qin Yu sighed lightly. This ability already involved the power of rules that he completely did not understand.

He continued to circulate the Five Elements Eight Trigrams Technique. After gathering countless pieces of information, he finally deduced a place.

The Azure Ridge Continent.

A trace of confusion flashed across Qin Yu’s eyes. What method would that place have to resolve the remaining divine sense restrictions?

Suddenly, he thought of someone.

That scholar, the one that made him reincarnate for three lifetimes with a glance.

Perhaps if he could find that scholar, he would have a way to solve this divine sense restriction. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Hope lit up in Qin Yu’s heart. With a move of his body, he had already leaped out.

In the Mystic Realm of the Azure Firmament Sect previously, Qin Yu stood in the void.

The previous mystic realm had long disappeared. He used his desolate divine eye to scan all the chains of the rules, trying to find the entrance to the mystic realm.

But no matter what, he could not sense that internal qi.

Qin Yu went through the entire Azure Ridge Continent but still did not find any clues.

He stood quietly in the void and carefully recalled all the details of the three lifetimes of reincarnation previously.

At that time, everything seemed to be real. When he first came out, he even seemed to have a feeling of old age.

All the life in the three lifetimes was deeply engraved in his soul.

That was why his soul had become so solid, making preparations for the condensation of the Bead of Soul.

Reincarnation was between life and death. If one did not die, how could one enter the path of reincarnation?

Qin Yu had a vague guess, but he could not confirm it.

He came to the place where the mystic realm was previously. Every rustle of the wind and grass here was natural.

Qin Yu’s body suddenly emitted an intense heat, and all the lawns on the Azure Ridge Continent slowly curled up.

In the Sumeru Space, pure vital energy drifted out.
