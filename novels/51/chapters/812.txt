At the door.

Yan Sihai and his son, as well as Yan Yongxiu, were waiting at the door.

Apart from that, Yan Sihai’s bodyguards followed closely by his side.

At this moment, Qin Yu walked out from the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

His face was cold and gloomy, and his entire body was filled with murderous intent.

Such a posture could not help but cause Yan Sihai to frown.

“Qin Yu!”Yan Yongxiu shouted.

Seeing the current Qin Yu, Yan Yongxiu had an indescribable feeling in his heart.

When he first met Qin Yu, he was still a useless person, but now he had grown to such a level. Yan Yongxiu really didn’t expect it.

Qin Yu ignored Yan Yongxiu and asked coldly, “Yan Sihai, why are you looking for me? Just say it.”

Yan Sihai held his cigar in his mouth and said indifferently, “Okay, then I’ll get straight to the point.” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“I heard that you took Yan Ruoxue Away?”

Qin Yu sneered, “Does it have anything to do with you?”

Yan Sihai said with a cold face, “Yan Ruoxue is a member of the Yan family. Do you think it has anything to do with her?”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh out of anger.

He pointed at Yan Sihai’s nose and said, “Yan Sihai, do you have any F * cking shame? When Yan Ruoxue was locked up in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association and suffering, you didn’t ask for her, but now you know that she is a member of the Yan Family?”

Facing Qin Yu’s ridicule, Yan Sihai was not angry.

He said indifferently, “That has nothing to do with you. How we deal with the people of the Yan family has nothing to do with you.”

“F * cking bullshit!”Qin Yu could not help but curse.

“Yan Sihai, you better get lost right now. Otherwise, I can’t guarantee that I won’t kill people.”

Hearing this, Yan Sihai could not help but take a step back.

At the same time, the bodyguards beside him also hurriedly blocked in front of him.

“Qin Yu, I’m not here to quarrel with you.”Yan Sihai snorted coldly.

“As an adult, Yan Ruoxue has the right to make her own choice. You let her make her own decision.”

Qin Yu’s brows immediately furrowed.

The current Yan Ruoxue was currently in a coma. How could she make any choice?

Yan Sihai seemed to have known all this. He smiled faintly and said, “If Yan Ruoxue can’t make a choice herself, then the guardian should make the choice.”

“Yan Yongxiu is Yan Ruoxue’s father. He has the most power. If you don’t let him go, I’ll call the police.”

“Qin Yu, no matter how bold you are, do you still dare to go against the authorities?”

Yan Sihai’s words undoubtedly infuriated Qin Yu.

He glared at Yan Sihai and said coldly, “You are really F * cking shameless...”

“Cut the crap,”Yan Sihai said with a cold smile.

“The person is from our Yan family. Hurry up and hand her over.”

Qin Yu immediately looked at Yan Yongxiu. Yan Sihai and his son also looked at Yan Yongxiu at the same time.

Yan Yongxiu frowned and said, “Qin Yu, Ruoxue is indeed my daughter. Don’t tell me I don’t even have the right to see my daughter?”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but gnash his teeth and say, “Yan Yongxiu, you’re really a F * cking good-for-nothing! You even know that Yan Ruoxue is Your Daughter?”

“Do you know how much suffering Yan Ruoxue has to endure every day when she’s locked up in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association? As a father, you don’t even dare to Fart, a good-for-nothing.”

Yan Yongxiu hurriedly explained, “What you said... I really don’t know.”

“F * ck you!”Qin Yu showed no mercy.

“You’re in the Yan family. I don’t believe that you don’t know anything!”

Yan Yongxiu was instantly dumbfounded.

Ever since Yan Ruoxue was caught, he had been pretending not to know. He had lied to himself in order to make himself feel better.

Now that he was exposed by Qin Yu, how could he feel comfortable in his heart.

“Now that she’s out, it shouldn’t be a problem for me to bring her home, right?”Yan Yongxiu said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “Do you know what Yan Sihai will do if he brings her back?”

“He will either kill Yan Ruoxue or send her back to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. Do You Want Your Daughter to continue suffering?”

Yan Yongxiu’s expression suddenly changed slightly. He subconsciously looked at Yan Sihai.

Yan sihai casually said, “Don’t worry. I Won’t do anything to Yan Ruoxue.”

“Do you believe that?”Qin Yu looked at Yan Yongxiu coldly and said, “Cultivation?”.

Yan sihai coldly said, “Qin Yu, don’t slander me!”

Qin Yu ignored Yan sihai and scolded, “Yan Yongxiu, think about how Yan Sihai treated Yan Ruoxue in the past!”

“If you are still a man and a father, don’t F * cking ask for her!”

“Yan Ruoxue is safer with me than anywhere else!”

At this point, Qin Yu changed the topic and said coldly, “Of course, if you want to force me, I don’t mind killing all of you!”

“For Yan Ruoxue, I will do anything!”

Yan Sihai narrowed his eyes and said, “Qin Yu, I don’t believe that you really dare to...”

“Pa!”

Before Yan Sihai could finish his words, a wave of boiling blood spilled on his face!

Turning around, he saw that the bodyguard beside him had his head blown open and his body had fallen straight down.

Qin Yu said coldly, “If you dare to talk nonsense again, he will be the end of you.”

At this moment, everyone was a little afraid.

A peak-stage martial marquis was actually killed by a single slap. He didn’t even have the strength to retaliate!

This kind of strength was self-evident.

“Qin Yu, I have the right to bring our people back!”Yan Sihai said in a flustered and exasperated manner.

Qin Yu stepped forward and said coldly, “Then you guys can come and try!”

As he spoke, the killing intent on Qin Yu’s body suddenly exploded. The icy coldness made people shiver all over.

At this moment, Yan Yongxiu suddenly said, “Big Brother, I think... What Qin Yu said makes sense.”

Yan Sihai was stunned and then angrily said, “Yan Yongxiu, what did you say? !”

Yan Yongxiu was silent for a moment. He gritted his teeth and said, “Big Brother, I think what Qin Yu said is right. At least it’s safer here than in the Yan family.”

“Yan Yongxiu, are you crazy?”Yan Sihai narrowed his eyes and said.

Yan Yongxiu took a deep breath and said, “I don’t have any status in the Yan family, but I don’t want to be a coward anymore.”

“When father died, I didn’t dare to say anything. I don’t want to see my daughter die too.”

“Uncle, your words will easily bring trouble to yourself...”Yan Jinyao said with a faint smile.

Qin Yu could not help but laugh out loud at the side, “Yan Jinyao, are you going to threaten your own biological uncle like this! If you are not convinced, come, let’s have a battle!”

As he spoke, Qin Yu took a step forward. His wild hair danced wildly, and his fighting spirit was overflowing. He was like an undefeatable war god!
