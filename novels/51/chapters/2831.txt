Qin Yu could even feel that sense of desire. It was the extreme desire of the Investiture of Gods’ true body for the incomplete page.

“Fatty, help me protect them! This is also the karma of the Buddhist Faramita. I’ll leave it to you! If you can borrow this karma, it might greatly help you.”

Qin Yu handed the two bracelets to Fatty Situ.

Facing the power of sealing gods, the power of these two bracelets was completely suppressed.

It was better to hand it over to Fatty. If he was in any danger in the future, he could still be of help.

He revealed a crazed expression. At this moment, he would have to fight to the death.

At this moment, the incomplete page of the Investiture of Gods in his hand lit up completely. A gap was opened in the Investiture of Gods space.

Qin Yu’s divine sense suddenly shot out from within. This time, he didn’t hold back at all.

Smoker Xie’s expression changed drastically. He didn’t know why Qin Yu suddenly made this choice.

However, this fleeting moment did not give him the time to speak.

A huge aura instantly erupted from Qin Yu’s body. In the Investiture of Gods space, Qin Yu could use the internal qi inside to cultivate.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

At this moment, the internal qi emitted from his body was not inferior to any king-level existence at all.

However, the price was heavy.

Once the giant of the Investiture of Gods descended, what awaited Qin Yu was only eternal suppression. He could never rise again like those Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals in the Primordial Chaos stage.

“Boss Qin Yu! Let me help you!”

Fatty Situ had a talisman with a divine picture of the Luo River in his hand. This was his last trump card.

“Don’t come over, Fatty Situ! I’ll leave them to you!”

Qin Yu shouted and stopped Fatty Situ.

Ling Bo!

Qin Yu bent his knees slightly and the muscles on his feet swelled up.

Then, he disappeared in front of Fatty Situ like an arrow leaving the bow.

Boom!

A meteor-like power descended.

Hundreds of giant apes were crushed into meat pies. Blood flowed like a river outside the Eight Desolates Beast Domain.

The rotten blood of the monster race flowed slowly in the ravines on the ground.

The 30 kings had gathered here along with tens of thousands of Dao Consciousness demonic beasts.

This place was filled with the internal qi of magical beasts. Nearly a hundred humans were blocking the way.

Some cultivators had awakened their peak power while some were in the Dao Consciousness Realm.

There were even some True Consciousness Realm cultivators whose bodies were piled up on the ground.

They protected Jiang Shengling behind them. At this moment, Jiang Shengling’s body was covered in white light.

The mighty righteous qi fell on his body, causing his internal qi to enter the Holy Consciousness Realm.

Moreover, that internal qi was still rising endlessly.

Jiang Shengling suddenly stood up and walked toward the core of the Eight Desolates Beast Domain.

With every step he took, the ground began to tremble.

Screech!

The demonic beasts in the air also sensed Jiang Shengling’s footsteps. In an instant, all of them went crazy.

Boom!

A huge black shadow suddenly descended.

Amidst the tyrannical roar of an ape, the two fists that were like giant hammers smashed down fiercely.

A visible shock wave shot through the air toward Jiang Shengling.

The snow-white sword accurately hit the shockwave.

The sword tip let out a shrill buzzing sound. Ling Xue’s arm started to shake.

His body kept retreating. The sleeve of his hand that was holding the sword was shattered. His bones made a violent sound as if they were about to break at any moment.

Roar!

The eyes of the demonic ape king turned blood-red. The huge ape’s palm suddenly pierced into its chest.

Thud! Thud! Thud!

Even in this noisy battlefield, one could still hear the sudden heartbeat.

The sound of his heart beating was like the dull sound of thunder.

“It’s a secret technique of the demonic apes. It can forcefully activate its potential and unleash the greatest power by squeezing its heart.”

Leng Yuanxun reminded in a deep voice.

The fur on its body suddenly expanded. Its blood vessels were like protruding hemp ropes all over its body.

In a few short breaths, its body had almost doubled in size.

A destructive aura erupted from its body.

Howl!

An earth-shaking roar came out of his mouth.

Then, the fist that condensed seemed to turn everything into nothingness.

It directly blasted towards the peak power condensed by the human race.

A visible power whistled out.

The space collapsed following the flow of that power, leaving behind a black void.

A few humans were unable to withstand the violent suction force and were suddenly sucked into the void.

“With my sword as heaven and earth.”

Qin Kun Throw!

This power far surpassed Ling Xue’s, but he did not take half a step back.

He held the snow-white sword in his hand as if he were grasping the entire world.

An unyielding sword intent emanated from his body as he threw the sword in his hand with all his strength.

The white and black Spiritual Energy Sword confronted the power of the demonic ape.

In the blink of an eye, the snow-white sword shattered into hundreds of pieces.

The terrifying power directly bombarded Ling Xue’s body.

The huge power of the demon ape after its berserk state poured directly into the human race.

A shadow flashed past and picked up the unconscious Ling Xue with one hand. Then, he turned around and left.

The energy did not completely stop after breaking the sword.

Instead, it directly exploded in the crowd. Fortunately, Ling Xue had absorbed nearly 70% of the force.

The remaining 30% of his power only caused some injuries and did not cause any serious consequences.

After the attack, the demonic ape’s huge body returned to its original size and seemed to have shrunk.

This attack had exhausted all of the demonic ape’s energy.

Before the dust from this attack could settle, nearly ten bright lights with monstrous power had already smashed down from all directions.

Dragon ball!

That was the dragon ball of a king-level magical beast. It was almost a desperate move of a king-level magical beast.

This full-powered attack would tear a huge gap in the human race.

That huge force crushed countless humans into powder. The people behind them rushed forward crazily.

All the humans slowly advanced toward the Eight Desolates Beast Realm. The path they took was already covered in blood.

The surrounding magical beasts were also constantly attacking the human defense line. There were even king-level magical beasts constantly charging towards them.

Before they reached the Eight Desolates Beast Domain, the human population had already decreased by half.

Kekeke!

A huge head shuttled through the vicinity of the human race. It appeared at times, but it could not be detected at times.

It was wandering in the void, looking for an opportunity to attack.

It was a magical beast with a human head and a snake that was nearly twenty meters tall. Two green snakes hung from its huge and sharp ears.

Judging from the internal qi it emitted, it was also a king-level magical beast.

Its internal qi was even stronger than the demonic ape’s.

As it continued to shuttle, it suddenly arrived above the human race.
