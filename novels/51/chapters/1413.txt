Chapter 1414: Chapter 1414, when do I need to give you face? 1

The people around were dumbfounded, and the boss was stunned on the spot.

“You... You’re courting death!”Zhao Yi was so angry that his whole body was trembling.

Qin Yu looked at Zhao Yi coldly and said, “If you don’t get lost, I’ll kill you too. Do you believe me?”

Meeting Qin Yu’s cold gaze, Zhao Yi was immediately frightened to the point of trembling.

He immediately took a few steps back and shouted at Qin Yu, “Qin Yu, do you know who I am? I am the successor of the Zhao family. My family has hundreds of servants. If you dare to touch me, the Zhao family will definitely not let you off!”

Qin Yu immediately clenched his fist and walked forward. When he saw this scene, Zhao Yi took off and ran.

Looking at his pathetic escape, the people in the room could not help but laugh out loud.

“Boss, what are you still standing there for? Hurry up and kill this tiger for me,”Qin Yu shouted.

The boss came back to his senses and hurriedly nodded. “Okay, okay, I’ll go now.”

The three to five people worked together and finally brought the Tiger’s body back to the kitchen.

“Everyone, don’t leave. I’ll treat everyone to Tiger Meat,”Qin Yu said with a smile.

However, the people in the restaurant were not as free as Qin Yu.

Someone walked forward and said, “The Zhao family’s strength can not be underestimated. Aren’t you afraid that they will come and find trouble with you?”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “How does the Zhao family compare to the Tianyun sect? I even dare to kill people from the Tianyun sect, let alone a beast from the Zhao Family?”

“But... you have already offended the Tianyun sect. Is there a need to offend the Zhao family again?”Someone asked doubtfully.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “There are many lice and they are not afraid of biting. What’s the point of thinking so much? Just wait for the meat.”

Among this group of people, some chose to leave this place. There were also some who were not afraid of the Zhao family and stayed behind, waiting to eat the meat.

After a round of busying in the kitchen, this tiger finally followed Qin Yu’s request and was served.

A fragrance instantly assailed one’s nostrils.

“What a fragrant smell!”Someone took a deep breath and said excitedly.

“Damn, I don’t know how many people this beast has eaten. Let’s try its meat today!”

“That’s right. The Zhao family is allowed to bully others, but they won’t allow us to eat its pets? Who Cares, Let’s Eat!”

Under Qin Yu’s lead, the group of people drank and ate the meat in large mouthfuls, feeling very happy.

Qin Yu could not help but praise. The taste of this beast was indeed delicious. It was not an exaggeration to say that it was much more delicious than all the delicacies Qin Yu had eaten.

“As expected of someone who spent a lot of money to buy it. The taste is really different.”Qin Yu wiped the oil from the corner of his mouth and said in satisfaction.

This tiger was extremely huge. It was enough for the entire restaurant to eat for several days.

Soon, everyone was almost done eating.

“Brother Qin, Can I bring some back? I want to give it to my wife and children to try.”

“Bring whatever you want! Everyone can bring back whatever they want to eat!”Qin Yu waved his hand, and a group of people immediately rushed up and snatched the entire tiger clean.

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu was quite happy in his heart.

The group of people cupped their hands to Qin Yu, and the scene looked very happy.

“Brother Qin, then we’ll go back first.”

“Thank you for your gift, Brother Qin! We ate very well!”

“You must be very happy to eat the food of our Zhao family, right?”

At this moment, a cold voice suddenly came from the door.

Everyone turned their heads and saw an old man looking at them coldly.

Behind him was a large group of servants, each of them aggressive.

“Mister... Mister Zhao.”Seeing this person, everyone’s expression couldn’t help but change.

Someone even directly put the remaining meat back on the table and said in horror, “I’ll put the meat back now...”

The old man called Mister Zhao ignored everyone. His gaze fell on Qin Yu.

With a wave of his hand, he sent the crowd to the side.

A path was opened between Qin Yu and Old Master Zhao.

Their eyes met, full of killing intent. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Old Master Zhao stepped forward and instantly appeared in front of Qin Yu.

He sized up Qin Yu and said indifferently, “I’m Zhao Feng of the Zhao family. Are You the famous Qin Yu?”

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “I’m not really famous. I just did a few things and gained some fame.”

Zhao Feng sneered and went straight to the point, “My Zhao family has no enmity with you. Why did you kill my Zhao family’s Earth Tiger?”

“It was your family’s people who provoked me first,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“Oh? He provoked you and wanted to be so ruthless. You’re really overbearing,”Zhao Feng said with a faint smile.

Qin Yu said with a cold face, “Don’t talk nonsense with me. That Zhao Yi deserves it. I didn’t beat him to death. I have already shown mercy to your Zhao family.”

Zhao Feng said with a cold smile, “In that case, I have to thank you?”

“You really have a lot of Bullsh * t to say. What do you want? Just say it.”Qin Yu slowly stood up.

This Zhao Feng was obviously a treacherous villain. He was full of Bullsh * t, making people feel annoyed.

He put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “It’s been many years since someone dared to talk to my Zhao family like this. I’ll give you a chance. Kneel down and apologize. Maybe I can consider sparing your life.”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and sneered, “You people really like to make people kneel down. Why? Do you want to satisfy your vanity?”

Zhao Feng ignored Qin Yu’s words and said darkly, “Do you kneel or not?”

Qin Yu said coldly, “Since I was born, I have never knelt to anyone. Do you think you are worthy to make me kneel?”

Zhao Feng’s expression instantly turned cold.

An extremely powerful aura was emitted from his body.

Qin Yu immediately felt a powerful pressure on his shoulders. It was like two huge mountains, trying to force Qin Yu to kneel.

Qin Yu snorted coldly. His body suddenly shook, and surging divine power immediately erupted.

The force that landed on Qin Yu’s shoulders also dissipated.

Zhao Feng narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “As expected of a kid who can make the Heavenly Cloud sect suffer. He really has some ability.”

“Old Thing, I’m not even afraid of the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s first elder. How can I Be Afraid of You?”Qin Yu said coldly.

“Is that so? So what if it’s the Heavenly Cloud Sect? Not to mention a puny first elder, even their sect master has to give me some face!”Zhao Feng shouted loudly.

An explosive shout was like rolling thunder, almost shattering the entire restaurant.

But at this moment, a voice came from behind:

“Oh? When do I need to give you face?”
