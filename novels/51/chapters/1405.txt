Chapter 1406: Chapter 1,406, serious injuries? 1

The confrontation between the two sides was about to erupt at this moment!

The first elder’s long hair danced in the wind, and his palm seemed to be forming some sort of seal.

“Great Heavenly Seal!”

At this moment, the first elder suddenly shouted, and a huge palm turned the sky and earth upside down!

The Great Heavenly Seal was one of the ultimate arts of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, and its power was boundless.

The fact that the first elder raised his hand and used the great heavenly seal was enough to show his anger!

Qin Yu’s muscles tensed up. He raised his head and looked at the palm that was about to land on the ground. The corner of his mouth curled up into a cold smile.

Just as the palm was about to land on his body, Qin Yu suddenly rushed towards the direction of the door!

“This kid wants to escape!”The hemp-robed old man shouted angrily. He immediately raised his finger and tried to seal off the space.

However, how could Qin Yu not have expected that he would clench his fist and roar, instantly shattering the spatial barrier!

When Qin Yu ran to the door, he stopped in his tracks.

He looked at the great heavenly seal. The fifth level of the battle word incantation had also disappeared at this moment.

Such actions immediately caused people to be puzzled.

What was this Qin Yu trying to do? Could it be that he had given up?

“Boom!”

Very soon, the Great Heaven Seal had already struck Qin Yu’s body!

With just a single palm strike, Qin Yu’s body was instantly shattered!

His skin cracked, his bones were broken, and his entire body was about to be smashed into meat paste!

Qin Yu lay on the ground, his body covered in blood, looking extremely miserable.

Above him, the first elder sneered repeatedly.

He looked down at Qin Yu from above and said indifferently, “This little bit of ability is only so-so.”

The others began to flatter him as if they had already won.

But at this moment, Qin Yu, who was lying on the ground, suddenly stood up and leaped toward the divine capital!

“Oh no, he’s going to run!”The hemp-robed elder shouted in a hurry!

By the time the first elder reacted, Qin Yu had already jumped back into the divine capital.

The great elder frowned slightly. He narrowed his eyes and snorted coldly, “He actually escaped back? Humph, so what if he escaped back? I can take his life with one palm!”

The hemp-robed elder wanted to say something, but after thinking for a while, he chose to keep his mouth shut in the end.

“Everyone, listen up. Surround him. We must not let him escape the divine capital!”The great elder shouted angrily.

Three hundred iron cavalry surrounded the divine capital until it was impenetrable.

As for the hemp-robed elder, he took out a dharma treasure from his sleeve. A huge net covered the entire divine capital.

Not to mention Qin Yu, even an ant would not be able to escape from this place.

The first elder was not in a hurry either. They were all at the Almighty Realm. They did not need to eat at all. They could afford to waste time even if it took them a long time.

In the divine capital city.

Qin Yu was lying on the ground, on the verge of death.

However, at this moment, there was a smile on his face.

“As expected... it’s as I expected. He’s heavily injured, but he’s still alive...”Qin Yu grinned, and blood flowed out from the corner of his mouth.

Qin Yu had just consumed the water of life, and the number on his forehead had become one.

However, if he wanted to recover his physical body, he had to reconstruct it.

Therefore, Qin Yu decided to use the great elder’s hand to heavily injure himself.

Since the divine capital was here, Qin Yu was not afraid of them barging in.

“With my current condition, I’m afraid I’ll need some time to recover my body.”Qin Yu gritted his teeth.

“I hope the Great Elder and the others can afford to wait.”

In the next few days, Qin Yu lay in the divine capital, quietly waiting for his body to recover.

There were still some medicinal herbs hidden in his spatial divine artifact, which could also speed up the recovery of his body.

Three days in a row.

The Heavenly Cloud Sect’s encirclement of Qin Yu did not show any signs of stopping. Everything seemed to be in a stalemate.

The first elder knew very well that he could not leave at this time. Otherwise, the Heavenly Cloud sect would lose face.

“Could this Qin Yu have already died in there?”Someone thought.

“Impossible. After all, he is a cultivator. How could he have died in there?”The hemp-robed elder shook his head.

The great elder stood above and shouted, “Qin Yu, don’t tell me you are going to hide in there all the time! Come out quickly and claim your death!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The divine capital was silent, and only echoes responded to him.

The hemp-robed elder narrowed his eyes and said, “Something is wrong. This Qin Yu seems to have deliberately let you slap him, seriously injuring him, but not to the extent of dying. It seems like there is some conspiracy.”

The great elder glanced at the hemp-robed elder and said with slight displeasure, “Deliberately? Why? Do you think that my slap is not enough to seriously injure him?”

The hemp-robed elder cupped his hands and said, “Of course I don’t mean that. I just feel that this matter must not be dragged on any longer.”

The Great Elder was silent for a moment, and then he shouted at the divine capital, “Qin Yu, if you still don’t come out, Don’t blame me for being impolite. I’ll immediately return to the Heavenly Cloud sect and kill Di Zun and the others!”

Qin Yu was already unconscious in the divine capital. How could he listen to his BULLSH * t.

The Great Elder’s eyes hardened. He looked at the hemp-robed elder and said, “Go back to the Heavenly Cloud sect right now and bring Zhen Yue and the others here!”

“It’s not suitable for me to go back. The Heavenly Cloud sect might not believe me,”the hemp-robed elder shook his head and said.

“It’s better for you to go back, Great Elder. I’ll wait here and make sure that Qin Yu can’t escape.”

First Elder frowned slightly. He took out the token from his pocket and handed it to the old man in the hemp robe. “This is my token. As long as you have this token, no one will dare to stop you.”
