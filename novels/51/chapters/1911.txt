1912 Asking for Someone by Name Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

At this moment, the third princess seemed to have thought of something.

She looked at the Semi-Saint and said, “How’s that kid?”

The Semi-Saint shook his head and said, “That kid is quite tough.”

“Tsk.” The third princess snorted. “I’d like to see how long he can last.”

After saying that, the third princess shook the chain in front of her. Qin Yu, who was far away on Xihuang Island, suddenly trembled slightly, and a sharp pain spread through his body.

He gritted his teeth and did not dare to be distracted the slightest, for fear that the third princess ‘will would plant her will in his primordial spirit.

After another day, Qin Yu was still resisting stubbornly. The Semi-Saint took away one of his fingers again.

In the following three days, Qin Yu’s primordial spirit was still not eroded by the chain. No matter how the third princess’s people tortured him, they could not affect his dao mind.

“D*mn it! This kid is pretty tough,” the third princess cursed.

Looking at Qin Yu in tattered clothes, a trace of viciousness flashed across her face.

With a shake of her palm, she took out a silver needle.

“Hehe! I’d like to see how long you can last.” The third princess flicked the silver needle in her hand, and it pierced through between Qin Yu’s eyebrows.

The moment the silver needle pierced in, Qin Yu’s body suddenly tightened. His brain felt like it was going to explode, and he was in great pain!

Under the double torture, Qin Yu’s divine sense was instantly affected. The moment he was slightly distracted, the force of the chain began to force its way toward Qin Yu’s primordial spirit!

“Ah!”

Qin Yu let out a painful wail. He gritted his teeth and tried his best to resist the force!

“Hmph! Let’s see how long you can last,” the third princess said proudly.

With a wave of her hand, she led everyone away.

Under such torture, Qin Yu no longer looked like a human. He looked horrible.

At night, the cold wind blew over like a cutting knife. Qin Yu’s cheeks were in pain.

In the end, Qin Yu could not hold on any longer.

Suddenly, he opened his eyes and quickly took out the small bottle of primordial spirits he had accumulated from his Spatial Magic Artifact.

“I have no choice now. If this continues, I’ll become her slave.” Qin Yu gritted his teeth.

He had suppressed his inner demons with tremendous difficulty. Thus he naturally didn’t want to use Satan’s secret technique again.

However, Qin Yu had no other choice.

Looking at the small bottle of primordial spirits in front of him, Qin Yu did not delay and quickly swallowed them all.

After devouring the bottle of primordial spirits, the power of Qin Yu’s primordial spirit suddenly became stronger!

The small golden figurine in his mind emitted an intense light. A terrifying power erupted and headed straight for the chain!

“Boom!”

Qin Yu could only feel a loud bang in his head. The chain was shattered by Qin Yu’s primordial spirit with one punch!

At the same time, the chain around Qin Yu’s neck shattered and turned into dust.

On the other end, the chain tied to the throne also broke apart and turned into dust.

Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief. He wiped away the sweat from his forehead, shook his body, and forced the silver needle out.

After all this, Qin Yu finally could breathe a little.

Looking at his hand with the broken fingers, his face turned cold.

“She’s so young, but she has such vicious thoughts,” Qin Yu couldn’t help but say coldly.

This kind of viciousness was innate. It was full of indifference to life without the slightest respect.

Unfortunately, she was the third princess of the Yan family. No one could control her.

The following day.

The third princess looked at the broken chain and was stunned for half a second.

“It’s broken! What’s going on?” Looking at the broken chain on the ground, the third princess said angrily, “Go to Xihuang Island now!”

Under the orders of the third princess, a group of people rushed to Xihuang Island.

On Xihuang Island, Qin Yu’s clothes were tattered, and his internal qi was weak. However, his body was ramrod straight and full of energy.

The third princess ran to Qin Yu. She reached out her hand, grabbed Qin Yu’s neck, and pressed him against the stone.

“You have some ability. You actually shattered my divine sense chain,” the third princess said viciously.

Although the third princess was unruly, she was not weak. The power in her hands was incomparably mighty, and it made Qin Yu hard to breathe.

“Well, well, well. You’re disobedient, aren’t you? Fine.” The third princess looked at the Semi-Saint beside her.

“Suppress him under purgatory!” the third princess said with a ferocious look.

The Semi-Saint frowned slightly. He then cupped his hands and said, “Third Princess, he is a member of the Yan family now. He has done something for the Yan family by guarding Xihuang Island. Why not… Let’s just forget it. ”

The third princess glared at him and scolded, “Stop talking nonsense. Hurry up and suppress him under purgatory!

“If we use purgatory, he… he’s probably going to be crippled,” the Semi-Saint said in a deep voice.

“I don’t care. If he’s crippled, let it be. At most, I’ll just get someone else!” the third princess said viciously.

Seeing the Semi-Saint not move, the third princess scolded loudly, “If you still don’t make a move, I’ll suppress you as well!”

The Semi-Saint sighed and took out the purgatory.

...

A small pagoda appeared in his palm.

The pagoda emitted a flame-like radiance, and a scorching heat hit Qin Yu in the face.

“Kid, you still have a chance if you apologize to the third princess now,” the Semi-Saint said coldly.

Qin Yu looked at the pagoda in his hand and sensed a strong sense of danger.

This pagoda was definitely not simple!

However, Qin Yu couldn’t be her slave willingly!

“Don’t talk nonsense with him. Hurry up and suppress him!” the third princess said viciously.

The Semi-Saint had no choice but to use the purgatory in his hand to suppress Qin Yu!

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He slowly got up and quietly used the spiritual power in his body, planning to fight back with all his might!

However, at this moment, a beam of light brushed past and pushed the pagoda to the side.

“Who dares to meddle in my business!” Seeing this, the third princess was furious!

...

She swept her gaze into the distance and saw a fit elderly man walking over.

This person was none other than Uncle Yan by Yan Ruoxue’s side.

Seeing Uncle Yan, everyone bowed in unison and greeted him, “Uncle Yan!”

Uncle Yan ignored the crowd and walked up to the third princess. He smiled and bowed, “Greetings, Third Princess.”

The third princess frowned and said unhappily, “Uncle Yan, what are you doing?”

Uncle Yan glanced at Qin Yu and said indifferently, “The saintess has specifically requested for Qin Yan to go to Mount Donghuang. I seek Third Princess’s understanding.”

Hearing this, the third princess couldn’t help but say with a darkened face, “Saintess! Saintess! It’s her again. She’s a person without a solid foundation who keeps going against me. It’s so annoying!”

“Uncle Yan, if he’s gone, who’s going to guard this Xihunag Island?” Someone walked over and asked in confusion.

“The saintess has said that it’s good enough to pick one of you to guard Xihuang Island,” Uncle Yan said with a smile.
