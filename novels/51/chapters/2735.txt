Chapter 2736 - 2736: The Choice

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

However, Qin Yu hadn’t experienced that stage personally. Therefore, he felt that was the fake Yan Ruoxue.

After he finished choosing, his vision tilted and he fell dead.

It was the same!

The scene in front of him was the same as he had seen.

He might have died by now if he hadn’t seen this from the old Daoist. Cold sweat kept dripping down from Qin Yu’s temples.

This person’s strength was far above Qin Yu since he could kill him. He was simply unable to resist.

The only chance he could survive now was to find this ‘person’ according to his rules!

Countless familiar faces appeared in front of him and the scene kept changing.

Countless scenes that Qin Yu was familiar with and unfamiliar with kept appearing in front of him.

Qin Yu stared fixedly at these images that appeared. The person in the white robe did not seem to be in a hurry.

He didn’t urge Qin Yu and just waited quietly.

Qin Yu carefully recalled the scene that day. He had died after making the wrong choice once. He had no chance to make a second choice. Therefore, this should be the Tomb of Heavenly Sins’ must-kill operation.

However, he had one more chance because he had seen the old Daoist’s omen. Qin Yu forced himself to calm down and put all his attention on the person who had appeared just now.

“Sister, I will protect you.”

Chang Mang stroked the head of a timid little girl. The little girl stood beside his huge body, making her seem tiny.

“Hello, can I do odd jobs here? I can do anything as long as you bring me food every day.”

The little boy asked nervously.

‘You have the bloodline of Immortal Emperor Tianming, so you are destined to be extraordinary in this life. Do you understand?”

A group of people stood in a dim room. The decoration here was very luxurious, but the atmosphere was freezing.

The little girl hugged the doll in fear. She wanted to find someone she was familiar with, but she realized there was no such person.

“Dad, Mom, I’m so scared. Where are you?”

Qin Yu only felt his heart clench and an indescribable heartache pierced

through his heart. Ruoxue had never told him about this before.

The figure slowly stood up and approached Qin Yu.

A feeling of death enveloped Qin Yu.

He could not use the Night Qi.

The Seal of Heaven Returning could not be used.

He couldn’t even use holy energy.

In other words, he couldn’t use the power of the Dao of Dreams to resolve it if he died, nor could he use the Seal of Heaven Returning and the Heart of Saint Kingdom to revive.

Qin Yu took a step forward. His figure split into two.

Then, it was divided into four until there was a Qin Yu in front of everyone.

“Ruoxue, don’t be afraid.”

Qin Yu held onto Ruoxue’s little hand and squatted to hug her gently.

He could feel the little girl’s confusion and fear.

“No matter where you are, I will always be with you until the end!” Qin Yu said softly. He held the little girl’s hand and left together.

After pushing open the door, they entered another deeper memory.

It was as if he was in the Nineteenth Prison, pushing open door after door.

He gradually walked into the depths of everyone’s memories. At this moment, Qin Yu already understood.

As the memories went deeper, Qin Yu figured out the whole thing.

These people were not the people in his memories at all. They were the memories of the original owner.

He was now constantly delving into the memories of these people.

At this moment, he had already forgotten how many doors he had entered. He saw the deepest memories of the people he was familiar with.

He could only determine whether they were heavenly sinners by going deeper and deeper.

“Ruoxue, if you can’t awaken the bloodline of the Heavenly Emperor, we’ll abandon your parents. This is a finger of your mother.”

The little girl screamed crazily and a violent power began to awaken in her body.

“Saintess, you must show greater value if you want to protect Qin Yu.”

“I know.”

Yan Ruoxue lowered her head slowly.

Qin Yu clenched his fists tightly. This scene almost made his eyes pop out of their sockets.

Yan Ruoxue had never told him about these things. It turned out that Yan Ruoxue had put in so much effort to make him live a stable life after entering the Holy Region.

“Ruoxue, I promise you that I won’t tire you out anymore.”

Qin Yu’s hand, which was holding the little girl’s hand, kept trembling. He could not control his tears.

He held Yan Ruoxue’s hands and pushed open the last door.

He wanted to share Yan Ruoxue’s darkness. He didn’t want Yan Ruxue to be so tired anymore.

In the last door, he saw chaos.

At this moment, he seemed to see a pair of terrifying eyes. With just a glance, Qin Yu felt he could be destroyed anytime.

The heavenly sinner slowly stood up and appeared in front of the countless Qin Yu clones.

“I found it.”

Qin Yu looked at this figure. His eyes were somewhat confused. It was as if a long time ago, he had made a bet with this person.

And now, he needed to give him the answer.

An extremely compressed holy energy out of his palm and blew up his head.

I am the Heavenly Sin!𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, the surrounding scene distorted and finally turned into nothingness as Qin Yu’s head exploded.

Qin Yu’s corpse lay on the ground. The man in front of him slowly stood in front of Qin Yu.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s chest exploded with a violent blood-red light. This blood-red light flowed to the original mark, and a blood-red Mark of Atonement slowly formed.

As the mark took shape, a gust of wind blew.

All the blood and minced meat flowed back again. A few words in blood appeared on the tombstone.

‘Qin Yu, alive.’

Qin Yu stood up once again after the person said the last word.

Heavenly Sin slowly carried the gravestone in front of Qin Yu, and then he slowly dissipated.

Clang!

With a flash, the saber light of the Tiger Wing had wrapped around the space where he was standing.

Qin Yu had not used the Order of Destruction for a long time. He was now using it again.

The saber light was like a black dragon from hell, directly heading towards the person standing in front of him.

The entire inn suddenly turned into nothingness. The destructive power turned the space around Heavenly Sin into nothingness.

“Tell me, where did you get their memories?”

Qin Yu’s eyes were suffused with a scarlet light. At this moment, he no longer cared about the difference in power between him and the Heavenly Sin in front of him.

He wanted to find out why Heavenly Sin had the memories of those people he was familiar with.

These things should only belong to him, especially Yan Ruoxue.

When the dust settled, Qin Yu found that Heavenly Sin was standing in front of him intact.

Qin Yu seemed to be able to feel a wave of anger due to his attack.

It was a kind of extreme disdain, the anger of a higher-level person offended by a lower-level person.

A gaze landed on Qin Yu..
