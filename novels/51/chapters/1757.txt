1758 The Final Struggle

The palm arrived in an instant and closed in on Yuan Xiu!

“Boom!”

A violent tremor erupted, and half of Yuan Xiu’s body was instantly shattered. Blood gushed out, and it was a terrible sight!

The bones in his hands had been shattered, and half of his face was exposed. It was a terrifying sight!

“This palm... He actually managed to severely injure Yuan Xiu!” the surrounding crowd was shocked!

“That’s right! Xiao Hai is actually so terrifying!”

“If he steps into the Reversion Void Stage, what will he do?”

“No wonder the two brothers of the Xiao family can stand tall in Nanzhou. Their strength is indeed too terrifying!”

Yuan Xiu not far away was slowly recovering.

His face was extremely cold, and his killing intent was even more terrifying.

“Xiao Hai, you’re really incredible.” Yuan Xiu said coldly.

“But do you still have the ability to fight? even if you are more talented than the heavens, I’m afraid that you have already become dispirited.”

Just as Yuan Xiu had said, Xiao Hai’s aura had started to weaken even though he had stood up.

The reason why he was still able to fight with him was all because he was strong-willed, he was supported by his faith.

It was already terrifying enough for someone at the half-step Reversion Void Stage to be able to fight to this point.

“You’re like a lamb waiting to be slaughtered now. You’re not worth mentioning.” Yuan Xiu said coldly.

As he spoke, his body had already recovered by more than half.

“At worst, I’ll just die again.” Xiao Hai’s expression was calm, as if he had already put his life and death aside.

“No!” At this moment, Jue Wu, who was standing at the side, suddenly shot towards Xiao Hai.

“What are you doing!” seeing this, Qin Yu hurriedly shouted!

Jue Wu ran behind Xiao Hai. She raised her palm and transferred true energy to Xiao Hai.

After a short while, Xiao Hai’s internal qi calmed down.

“Many thanks.” Xiao Hai looked at Jue Wu and said with a smile.

Jue Wu patted Xiao Hai’s shoulder and said, “You have to work hard, I have high hopes for you!”

Xiao Hai opened his mouth and was about to say something when his expression suddenly changed.

“Jue Wu, be careful!” Qin Yu, who was not far away, also shouted in a hurry!

A bone-chilling light pierced through the void and headed straight for Jue Wu!

At this distance, there was no possibility of dodging!

“Splat!”

At this moment, Xiao Hai stood in front of Jue Wu.

The bone-piercing light pierced through Xiao Hai’s thick body and shattered half of his cheekbone.

“Xiao Hai!” Jue Wu’s face suddenly became extremely ugly.

Xiao Hai was frighteningly calm. He wiped the blood from his face and looked at Jue Wu. “I’m fine. Go to the side and wait.”

Jue Wu grunted in agreement. She didn’t stay any longer and hurriedly left.

Even though half of Xiao Hai’s face had been shattered, his breathing had returned to normal, and there was still a possibility of a battle.

Yuan Xiu looked at Xiao Hai coldly, his heart filled with iciness.

“It’s already not bad that you were able to delay me for so long.” Yuan Xiu said coldly.

“But next, I will kill you immediately.”

“Boom, boom, boom...”

Right at this moment, the sky was suddenly covered in dark clouds. Doors opened one after another and wrapped around the pitch-black clouds, as if something was brewing.

Everyone raised their heads and looked at the terrifying sky.

“Not good, Xiao Sheng is about to undergo his tribulation!” Sima Bei was the first to react!

He hurriedly looked in Xiao Sheng’s direction. As expected, Xiao Sheng’s body was currently emitting wisps of aura.

And right at this moment, Xiao Sheng suddenly opened his eyes!

Two bright lights shot out and swept across the sky!

After that, Xiao Sheng’s gaze fell on Xiao Hai.

“You... You’re still alive?” A look of shock appeared on Xiao Sheng’s face as well.

“If you don’t reach the Reversion Void Stage as soon as possible, everyone will die here today,” Xiao Hai replied.

Xiao Sheng didn’t say anything more. He raised his head to look at the sky, then held his breath and focused his attention, preparing to face this terrifying heavenly tribulation.

With Xiao Sheng’s talent, his heavenly tribulation was naturally extremely terrifying!

Sima Bei and the others did not dare to move forward, and were unable to stop him!

“He Teng, use your White Bone Club to block him!” Yong Ji warned.

He Teng laughed coldly, but he didn’t move.

“Lord, kill Xiao Hai as soon as possible. We can’t let Xiao Sheng reach the Reversion Void Stage!” Sima Bei shouted in a hurry.

Yuan Xiu naturally understood that once Xiao Sheng reached the Reversion Void Stage, he would have no chance of winning today!

“Xiao Hai, I’ll send you on your way!” Yuan Xiu said coldly.

With that, he raised both his hands and began to perform his dao technique!

Very quickly, that terrifying scene appeared once again!

A terrifying scene appeared above Yuan Xiu’s head!

This was also a small world, and the first thing that entered his eyes were three large golden words: Immortal Slaying Sect!

In this world, many people were dancing, True Saints bowing, and even great cultivators at the Tribulation Stage!

Qin Yu’s face turned pale when he saw the scene clearly.

This scene was extremely familiar. It was the same scene that Qin Yu had seen on earth!

“It’s true! It’s the Immortal Slaying Sect!” Qin Yu gasped!

In this case, the origin of the Immortal Slaying Sect might really be earth!

Not only Qin Yu, He Teng, who was not far away, also noticed this strange scene.

He squinted his eyes, thinking about something.

“Boom, boom, boom...”

That scene gave off a terrifying roar, and even a wisp of aura that was casually emitted made people’s chests feel stuffy!

“Boom!”

At this moment, an extremely heavy aura was emitted from the scene!

The target of this aura was Xiao Hai!

Xiao Hai raised his head and roared. He raised his hands in an attempt to resist the force.

However, the final result was extremely disturbing. After all, this was Yuan Xiu’s trump card, a forbidden spell. It was definitely not something that Xiao Hai, who was a half-step Reversion Void Stage, could resist!

Just this wisp of aura had cut Xiao Hai in half at the waist!

Half of his body fell to the ground, and his powerful aura was rapidly leaking out like a deflating balloon!

“If this continues, I’m afraid that even Xiao Hai won’t be able to hold on!” Wen Wanchong said coldly. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“But we can’t help much. If Xiao Hai can’t hold on, it’s even more impossible for you and me.” Qu Zhu said coldly.

Qin Yu clenched his fists tightly. He stared at the scene with his heart in his throat.

“Senior Xiao Hai, you must hold on...” Qin Yu’s pupils dilated, and his face was covered in sweat.

Xiao Hai, who had fallen to the ground, raised his palm and was also performing a spell!

“Boom, boom, boom...”

At the same time, Xiao Sheng’s heavenly tribulation had also begun.

The terrifying heavenly tribulation poured down in torrents, as if it was going to shatter this piece of heaven and earth!

Xiao Hai raised his hands, and the dark clouds in the sky suddenly changed, as if they had a connection with Xiao Hai!

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu suddenly remembered the scene of Xiao Hai dying in battle in the North Plain!

At that time, Xiao Hai seemed to have used the same technique!
