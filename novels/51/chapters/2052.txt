2053 The Scary Thing about Wu Ji

Before the Chaos Grave opened, Qin Yu had obtained two skeletons.

The two skeletons happened to be placed on the fish eyes of the Tai Chi Diagram. All this while, Qin Yu did not know the origin of these two skeletons, but now he planned to give it a try using these two skeletons.

“No matter what, I have to try and see,” Qin Yu took a deep breath and said in a low voice.

He didn’t tell Jue Wu and Xiao Hai about this because once he told them his thoughts, they would definitely go with him together.

However, Qin Yu was not confident at all. The Chaos Grave was like a killing machine. Once he failed, it would mean death.

Therefore, Qin Yu did not want them to take the slightest of this risk. He could only pretend to give up.

Qin Yu restrained his internal qi and walked on the street.

He wasn’t in a hurry to go to the Chaos Grave. Instead, he planned to go to the Cold Moon Palace to see Saintess Gu.

No one knew the outcome of his action. Therefore, Qin Yu planned to make clear what he needed to make clear before heading to the Chaos Grave.

The journey was smooth and unobstructed. The Si family seemed to have already given up on Qin Yu and did not take any action to search for him.

Therefore, it didn’t take Qin Yu long before he arrived at the Cold Moon Palace.

Standing at the entrance of Cold Moon Palace, two doormen blocked Qin Yu’s way.

Qin Yu walked forward. He bowed slightly and said, “Please inform Saintess Gu that Qin Yu requests an audience.”

When the doormen heard Qin Yu’s name, a trace of surprise flashed across their faces.

They sized up Qin Yu with suspicion in their eyes.

“Let him in.”

At this moment, a leisurely voice came from the depths of Cold Moon Palace.

Hearing that, the two doormen bowed to Qin Yu and said very politely, “Mr. Qin, please follow us.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He followed the two doormen and stepped into the Cold Moon Palace.

Cold Moon Palace was floating in mid-air, surrounded by a thin layer of mist. It made people feel like it was a fairyland.

As soon as one entered the palace, one could see ancient buildings and green pebble paths. Ancient laurel trees covered the sky, and countless exotic flowers and herbs were planted under the trees, emitting a refreshing fragrance.

Walking to the side of the winding path, one could see the mottled shadows of the green bamboo forest. Several crisp chirps of birds would pass through the ears from time to time,

This place was like an immortal pavilion shrouded in the moonlight. It was cold and beautiful.

Soon, Qin Yu arrived under the huge Osmanthus tree.

As usual, Saintess Gu sat under the Osmanthus tree, drinking tea and playing the zither like a fairy. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Mr. Qin.” Upon seeing Qin Yu, Saintess Gu smiled at him.

Qin Yu bowed and sat opposite Saintess Gu.

“Mr. Qin, how did you make time to come to my cold place?” Saintess Gu said as she poured tea for Qin Yu.

Qin Yu said half-jokingly and half-seriously, “I miss you, can’t I?”

“I’m really honored to be missed by Mr. Qin,” Saintess Gu said, pretending to be surprised.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said thoughtfully, “Now that I’ve become the common enemy to all of you, will there be any ambushes in your Cold Moon Palac? Will the Gu family attack me?”

Hearing this, Saintess Gu couldn’t help but laugh evilly. “It’s hard to say. But… since Mr. Qin is already here, you must have made plans, right?”

“Not really.” Qin Yu shook his head, and his expression became nervous.

He was prepared to take out his Saint Weapon and fight to the death.

Seeing Qin Yu’s nervous expression, Saintess Gu burst out laughing.

“I’m just joking. Mr. Qin, you don’t have to be so serious. The people of the Gu family will never step into my Cold Moon Palace,” Saintess Gu said.

Qin Yu nodded. He did not ask in detail and continued, “Why isn’t any movement from the nine great aristocratic families recently? Everything seems to have calmed down.”

“Isn’t it a good thing?” Saintess Gu said as she sipped her tea.

“I’m afraid it’s the calm before the storm,” Qin Yu said with a dark face.

Saintess Gu didn’t respond to what he said. Instead, she said, “Have some tea.”

Qin Yu grabbed the cup of tea on the table and drank it all. The atmosphere seemed to have fallen into a short stalemate.

“The Si family… won’t give up on the Chaos Grave just like that, right?” After a while, Qin Yu broke the stalemate and asked.

Saintess Gu poured another cup of tea for Qin Yu and said, “Not just the Si family. No one will give up easily. That’s Wu Ji’s grave. His value is no less than an Immortal Emperor, or even higher.

“After all… Compared to the long endless river, the Golden Age’s arrival is extremely short.”

“Everyone wants to find another path when the dao technique does not allow it?” Qin Yu asked in a deep voice.

“Yes.” Saintess Gu sighed. “But it’s too difficult. Not to mention finding another path to integrate nine dao techniques, even breaking through to the Reversion Void Stage is an extremely difficult task.

“Even geniuses like Yan Guyun and Si Liuhe couldn’t do it, let alone other people. Therefore, Wu Ji’s Big Grave has become even more mysterious and valuable.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. Yan Guyun and Si Liuhe were both rare exceptional geniuses, but even they couldn’t break through during the peaceful time, let alone others.

“Saintess Gu, do you know much about Wu Ji?” Qin Yu asked as he sipped his tea.

“I don’t know much about Wu Ji,” Saintess Gu shook her head. “But I’ve heard some rumors about him. ”

Qin Yu was silent and waited for Saintess Gu Gu to continue.

“Wu Ji is a very unfortunate talent because he was born during the Degenerate Age,” Saintess Gu said slowly.

“The Degenerate Age?” Qin Yu was a little puzzled.

Saintess Gu explained, “Since there are booming times for the dao technique of heaven and earth, naturally, there will be desolate times. For example, after the Golden Age, the dao technique of heaven and earth will fall into an incredibly withered state. Then it will slowly recover until it enters the Golden Age again.

“Unfortunately, Wu Ji was born in the Degenerate Age when the dao technique withered the most. In the previous era, the stars were shining brightly, and the Immortal Emperors were rampaging. They had already used up all the dao techniques.

“In his era, not to mention stepping into the Tribulation Stage or integrating nine dao techniques, even stepping into the Reversion Void Stage is impossible.”

Qin Yu’s face revealed a trace of shock. He naturally knew how difficult it was to reach the Reversion Void Stage before the arrival of the Golden Age.

However, Wu Ji had stepped into the Tribulation Stage in this era and wanted to achieve dao in an unconventional way!

Such talent was truly terrifying!

“Wu Ji is great, but at the same time, he is lonely,” Saintess Gu shook her head and said.
