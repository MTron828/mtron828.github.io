Chapter 2548 Half-Human and Half-Monster Saint

It was a terrifying storm of heaven and earth. Qin Yu’s Spiritualization Technique transformed into five shields.

Only by enveloping the five of them within the shield did the pressure on them decrease.

“Many thanks, my friend Qin Yu! Have you recovered?”

Shen Qian asked curiously.

Qin Yu had been severely injured. They would probably take a few months to recover if they were Qin Yu, and it is even possible to take a few years.

As a cultivator’s cultivation realm advanced, regardless of his physical body or soul, the vital energy accumulated in every part of his body would be even more abundant. Therefore, it would naturally take longer to recover.

If Qin Yu had not fulfilled the agreement with the artifact spirit of the celestial artifact, the Heart of the Ocean, and was rewarded with the Source of Life.

He would not be able to recover without ten days to half a month, let alone transform the Glazed Holy Body again, even if his Glazed Holy had remarkable recovery ability.

“Yes, I just had a breakthrough and have the strength to fight again now.”

Qin Yu nodded but did not explain everything in detail.

Seeing Qin Yu not disclosing, a few of them tacitly stopped asking. Everyone had their own secrets. If they continued to ask, they would end up rubbing up someone the wrong way.

At this moment, Xuan Tian and Xuan Xin were staring at the blurry figure. They seemed to want to see if there were further changes.

“Are you sure this is Saint Zi Yang?”

At this point, Qin Yu dared not continue to look at that figure. The two strongest people, Xuan Xin and Xuan Tian, had been captivated by that back.

If he, too, was immersed in it, there might not be anyone to stop it if there was any danger nearby.

The strength of the other four people was not deficient, but there was a noticeable gap compared to Xuan Xin and Xuan Tian from the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect.

“That’s right. It’s easy to connect the power of Daoism with one’s comprehension. Furthermore, Saint Zi Yang has records in his sect, so there’s no mistaking this back view and this aura.”

Xuan Tian’s eyes welled with tears.

At this moment, even though Qin Yu, who did not immerse his mind in the void, could feel the increasingly heavy sorrowful aura. Xuan Tian, who had been focused on sensing the changes, was hit the hardest. His tears fell uncontrollably.

“Tell me, Martial Uncle! What exactly happened? You are the bright light of our Three Purities Sect. Why are you trapped here? Why didn’t you return to the Three Purities Sect? Why did you become like this today?”

Xuan Tian roared.

The voice shot into the sky, and countless enormous monster beasts soared into the sky as if they were frightened by Xuan Tian’s terrifying killing intent.

The figure far away in the void suddenly trembled as if he had heard Xuan Tian’s words.

He slowly turned around.

As he turned around, Qin Yu gasped when he saw the appearance of his body.

A half-human, half-monster blurry figure appeared in front of Qin Yu. It was a terrifying and disgusting scene and emanated an evil internal qi.

His human side still maintained its original appearance but had been tainted by the corruptive force, displaying a sickly pallor. His skin became ulcerated and contorted as if scorched by demonic fire. Bruises and festering wounds covered his skin, with blood mingling with dark magic, emitting a nauseating stench.

His eyes lost their human luster and became hollow and evil. His pupils expanded to the extreme, filled with endless darkness. When he looked at you, he seemed to be able to devour your soul, evoking a profound sense of fear. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

His half-monster side displayed a distorted and perverted evil form.

His monster body was covered in sharp bone spurs and tentacles, much like a corrupted monster. Its skin was blackish-red in color and emitted scorching monster flames as if it could spew out dark power that could destroy everything at any moment.

His mouth was full of sharp teeth, emitting a rotten smell that induced a deep sense of disgust and revulsion.

“A Saint has been possessed!”

A tremendously cold feeling rushed straight to Qin Yu’s head like a bucket of ice water pouring over his head.

Saint Zi Yang was not dead but was possessed!

A human Saint had fallen to the monster race. This news would probably shock the entire human world, but it had actually appeared in front of them.

“Was it due to the invasion of the heavenly monster race that Saint Zi Yang was possessed? Can we eliminate the heavenly monster race and see if we can bring Saint Zi Yang back?”

Qin Yu said anxiously. If it showed his might, no one here could leave.

“My Daoist ancestors had dao minds as strong as heaven. If heaven didn’t break, their dao minds wouldn’t be destroyed. Therefore, how could the heavenly monster invade them? Martial Uncle had probably encountered an extreme emotional impact, which was why his dao mind lost control and was invaded by the dark power. Otherwise, what kind of power can transform a Saint!”

Xuan Tian clenched his fists tightly.

Qin Yu nodded, although he did not understand the Three Purities Sect.

However, he had come into contact with Daoist priests on Earth and had some understanding of their cultivation path.

Daoist characters often pursued detachment from emotions and desires, making their inner selves unfathomable.

They might conceal their true intentions and emotions, and as their spiritual cultivation deepened, they concealed them even more. Unless one touched that specific soft spot, even death would not trigger emotional fluctuations in them.

As for the Saint, the soft spot was even deeper.

Since ancient times, they had only heard of the fall of Saint but not the betrayal. It was an inconceivable matter.

Saint Zi Yang in the sky appeared clear sometimes and illusory at times.

His monster body sometimes released a terrifying destructive storm and other times regained clarity.

His blood-red eyes stared at everyone, making everyone feel shackled.

“We have to think of a way to retreat. He has been demonized by nearly 80%, and the dark energy is gradually covering his eyes. If he makes a move, I’m afraid none of us can resist his attack. Moreover, we’ve discovered the secret of this place. I’m afraid the dark living beings nearby won’t let us off.”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said. He had felt countless dark living beings gathering toward this place.

“If Martial Uncle attacks us, we will definitely die. I want to use my firefly power to try to communicate with Martial Uncle again!”

Xuan Tian soared into the sky and stopped at a place far away from Saint Zi Yang.

It was not that he did not want to go any closer but that he could not.

A domain seemed to be between them. No matter how fast he was, there was a distance between him and Saint Zi Yang.

“At the end of the journey, looking back, reflect on the original aspiration, and return to simplicity and truth.

“Great Dao is formless and gives birth to the heavens and earth. Great Dao is emotionless and moves the sun and moon.

“Great Dao has no name, but it nurtures all things.

“I don’t know its name, but I insist on calling it Dao.

“The so-called Dao is clear and turbid, dynamic and static. Heaven is clear, and earth is turbid. Heaven is dynamic, and earth is static.”

Xuan Tian had already regained his calm. He sat cross-legged in the air.
