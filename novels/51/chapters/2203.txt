2204 Conspiracy

At this moment, Qin Yu was on the same starting line as these geniuses for the first time since he came to the Holy Region.

“A b*stard who has no connections with the aristocratic family can actually break through to the True Saint Realm. D*mn it!”

Yao Xi’ was ashen. He had broken through to the True Saint Realm in one fell swoop.

He had initially wanted to wash away the shame and humiliation in the past, but to his dismay, he had witnessed a scene that made him seeth with fury.

“Sir Yao, why are you in such a hurry to come to my Si family?”

Si Wujue said softly.

“If this kid returns from the Black Platform, he will definitely shake the foundations of our nine great aristocratic families.”

The head of the Yao family narrowed his eyes and said.

“My Yao family has mobilized two elders but couldn’t kill this kid. If this continues, I’m afraid our nine great aristocratic families will fail to restrain him.”

“Hahaha, Holy Lord Yao is too serious. If he returns, I will make him understand the power of an aristocratic family.”

Si Liuhe said with a smile. After breaking through to the True Saint Realm, he had become fearless.

“Even if we want to kill them, Black Platform is thousands of ship years away from the Holy Region. I’m afraid we can’t do so even if we want to.”

Si Shiyue shook his head.

“Do you still remember the group of people exiled to purgatory a thousand years ago? Their relatives seemed to be locked up in the Sky Water Prison.”

Yao Qi said.

“Send a message to the people guarding the purgatory. Once Qin Yu appears in purgatory, they must kill him.”

“Qin Yu is currently on the Black Platform Continent, so why would he go to purgatory? Unless you want that person from the Blackplatform Continent to take action. But that person had probably broken through long ago and was unable to make a move on the True Saint Realm.”

Si Shiyue frowned.

“That’s right. The Yao family will take out three magical artifacts at the peak of the Tribulation Stage and send them over through the formation gate as the price for his attack. As long as he suppresses his cultivation realm, we won’t have to worry about the backlash of the laws of heaven and earth. Moreover, this person is from our Holy Region and has some connections with our Holy Region’s aristocratic family.”

Yao Qi squinted his eyes and said.

Qin Yu and their Yao family were already at loggerheads. Moreover, even he was shocked at the talent that Qin Yu displayed.

If Qin Yu really came back, the Yao family would probably go through a catastrophe.

“Oh yes, a buddy of Qin Yu seems to be in the Skywater Prison. Bring him out and break his limbs, and I’ll spread the news to destroy Qin Yu’s dao mind. Aren’t you awesome? I’ll let you see how I make your brother become a human swine!”

Yao Xi laughed maniacally.

On the Black Platform Continent, Qin Yu was silently cultivating. He knew nothing about what happened in the Holy Region tens of thousands of miles away.

And this cultivation lasted for nearly three months.

He had used up all the spiritual essence around him but only broke through from the first-grade True Saint to the second grade.

These were the spiritual essence that Black Platform had plundered for nearly a thousand years. The terrifying energy they contained within was probably enough for an ordinary first grade to break through to the ninth grade.

However, Qin Yu discovered that his body uncontrollably absorbed this spiritual energy during the cultivation.

Every single cell under the Saintly Body Technique seemed to have expanded to the extreme and accommodated immense amounts of spiritual energy.

80% of the spiritual energy was absorbed by his body. With a thought from Qin Yu, the ninth level of the Saintly Body Technique was activated.

With a single punch from his physical body, a Category 16 hurricane seemed to have stirred up out of thin air.

An enormous vortex appeared in the sky ten thousands of feet away. This was only the power of his physical body.

Qin Yu put away the Saintly Body Technique. Looking at the crushed spiritual essence on the ground, he had a headache.

Cultivating alone under the Green Spirit Tree was just a drop in the bucket. Unless three Green Spirit Trees combined, and he forcefully absorbed the spiritual energy they contained within, only then could this possibly satisfy Qin Yu’s current needs.

“Senior.”

Uncle Qun, not far away, said with some trepidation.

“If I go to the Heavenly Cloud Continent, can I find a way to return to the Holy Region?”

Uncle Qun’s body trembled, and he braced himself and said.

“Senior, even if you head to the Heavenly Cloud Continent, you probably need to return to the Holy Region by ship. But no ship can travel through the galaxy for a thousand years, not even the warship made by the top-notch master refiner.”

“Not even a teleportation formation?”

Qin Yu felt a headache.

“The Heavenly Cloud Continent is even more barren than the Black Platform Continent. The teleportation formation can probably only transmit some images and voice transmissions. It’s basically impossible to gather the spiritual essence required for the formation unless everyone on the continent gives up cultivation and condenses all the spiritual energy into the immense amount of spiritual essence required.”

Uncle Qun said with a bitter smile.

“What’s the use of this teleportation formation then?”

Qin Yu was furious when he heard that. How could he return to the Holy Region, and how long would it take?

“The spatial teleportation formations are all set up by high-level galaxies. Often the high-level galaxies will exile some prisoners to purgatory. The spiritual energy required for going low from high is much less than low to high.”

Uncle Qun explained patiently.

Qin Yu could roughly understand this. It was like a slide in which going down only required a push, but going up required tremendous force.

“Show me around Black Platform City.”

Qin Yu let out a light sigh and said to Yun Qingyun.

People were coming and going in the Black Platform City, creating a lively and bustling atmosphere.

Under Qin Yu’s divine sense, 80 percent of the people in the city were ordinary people.

Everyone was busy earning a living.

The people of the various families had almost occupied all the places with surging spiritual energy.

“Survival of the fittest seems to be the truth everywhere.”

Qin Yu sighed softly.

At this moment, there was a particularly lively place.

“The Artifact Refining Association’s competition is held at that place. Today, all the formation masters and master refiners from the nearby galaxies are here to participate. The first place will be rewarded with ten pieces of spiritual essence.”

The noise attracted Yun Qingyun, but she dared not run over because she had to lead the way.

She looked pathetic.

“Let’s go over and take a look.”

Qin Yu smiled. He seemed to have seen Yan Ruoxue’s shadow.

“This formation is called the Edge. It was created by three generations of my family combining the Path of Heaven.”

On the stage, a gray-robed elderly man holding an ordinary iron sword stabbed at the dark iron before him.

The iron sword pierced through the dark iron several feet thick as if it pierced through tofu. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“As expected of Master Zheng Ming. Even an ordinary iron sword has such pressure under the enhancement of this formation.”

A young man watching from the side shouted.

“Wow, it’s amazing! Truly amazing!”

Yun Qingyun clapped hard.

Qin Yu nodded. Regardless of alchemy, artifact refining, or formation, it contained the laws of heaven and earth when it was done to the extreme.

The Pavilion Master, for example, had already reached the peak in alchemy, and her martial arts realm was not weak either.

And in the remote galaxies of barren and desolate lands, forging and formations seemed to have their unique ways.

“The bayonet is engraved with the gravity formation. A single slash bears the power of a mountain.”

A blue-robed young man walked onto the stage and gently pressed his bayonet down on the pile of dark iron.

There was no spiritual energy fluctuation, and the pile of dark iron suddenly turned into thousands of pieces.
