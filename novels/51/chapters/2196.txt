2197 Terrifying Strength

The burly man was stunned for a while. For a moment, he could not process the situation in his mind.

“Why did these Demonic Beasts self-destruct? What’s going on?”

Qin Yu was speechless. “Has your brain all grown on your muscles?”

“Oh, you did it?”

Only then did the burly man react. However, after carefully processing Qin Yu’s words, he flew into a rage.

“How dare you! Go to hell!”

The burly man held the axes in his hands. His eyes were red, and in an instant, the axes were covered in a layer of blood-red flames. A violent wind blew out in all directions with the axes as the center.

He was a genuine peak Semi-Saint. Judging from his power, he would probably enter the True Saint Realm if he took another step forward.

“Be careful! Brother Wuji,” Yun Qingyun’s voice was trembling.

She had never seen such a terrifying aura before. Beside her, Fengqing’s legs were trembling like a sieve.

“Boom!”

With a terrifying strike, even the tens-of-tons heavy warship started to sway and float.

“You, reckless fellow! How dare you provoke me?”

The burly man put away his axes and stared at the people on the warship with a mocking expression.

“You’re actually from the Skeleton Gang!” Uncle Qun’s face was ashen.

Shuttling among the galaxy, due to the lengthy duration, many people carried valuable possessions with them.

As a result, notorious gangs that blocked the way and robbed appeared. The Skeleton Gang was one of them, and this burly man was one of the leaders famous for killing.

Uncle Qun only recognized him after the attack just now.

“I’m willing to give away the Green Spirit Tree. Please spare us, my friend.”

Uncle Qun leaned over and said, a drop of sweat dripping down unconsciously.

“I’ve changed my mind. Bring this girl to my room, kill everyone else, and burn this broken ship.”

The burly man stared at Yun Qingyun lecherously.

“Cough! Cough! This brainless and muscular grandson, have you forgotten about your grandfather?”

Qin Yu was instantly speechless.

He thought he could scare the burly man with a casual attack, but he did not expect him to ignore him.

“Eh, who are you?”

The burly man had a puzzled look on his face. Even an Advanced-stage Reversion Void cultivator would have been reduced to ashes by that attack just now. He had never expected Qin Yu to be completely fine.

Qin Yu did not waste any words. He immediately stepped out and appeared beside the burly man. Then he pressed his palm down on his shoulder.

In an instant, that terrifying killing intent enveloped the entire space. Everyone felt frozen by a ten-thousand-year-old ice and could not move their legs.

A foul stench suddenly appeared on the warship where Uncle Qun was, and behind Fengqing, a large pile of feces in a brownish-yellow color suddenly appeared.

Before the palm landed, the burly man’s body had already split apart.

“Hero, spare me! I’m from the Skeleton Gang. We can split the treasures on this ship. If you kill me, our boss won’t let you off!”

“Go to hell!”

Qin Yu was expressionless. His state of mind never wavered when he killed those who killed people for pleasure.

“Boom!”

The space where the burly man was standing seemed to have hurricane-force winds, with thunder and lightning raging and powerful winds howling.

The burly man and all the people behind him turned into powder instantly. Even the powder could not be found.

And the warship had a huge hole.

“This is the might of the True Saint! Now, I can be completely fearless against Si Liuhe!”

Qin Qin Yu closed his eyes as he tried to feel his first attack in ten years or so. He could easily crush a cultivator at the peak of the Reversion Void stage into dust.

“Sir?”

Uncle Qun stood by the side, trembling in fear. The space opposite them was still full of lightning and thunder. Sensing the aftershock of the attack, he was even more shocked, afraid that Qin Yu would have any thoughts about them.

Only then did Qin Yu come back to his senses and realize that everyone on the ship was staring at him in fear.

Just as he was about to say something, a pungent smell suddenly assailed his nostrils.

“D*mn, who took a dump?”

Qin Yu cursed.

Only then did everyone notice Fengqing, who was scared out of his wits and soiled. A few of them could not conceal their expressions, showing disgust on their faces.

In fact, Fengqing could not be blamed. That attack just now had released the killing intent of the past few decades.

Qin Yu had intentionally blocked the terrifying killing intent from the others, but he naturally ignored this rude fellow.

“Mr. Qin, you’d better run away as soon as possible.”

Uncle Qun suddenly said worriedly.

Looking at Qin Yu’s puzzled face, he said worriedly.

“The person that Mr. Qin killed just now was a captain of the Skeleton Gang. Through the rune message transmission on the ship, I’m afraid the Skeleton Gang has already known about what happened here.”

“Uncle Qun, the Skeleton Gang can’t have reacted so quickly, right? What happened just now was only in the blink of an eye.”

Yun Qingyun blinked her eyes. She now looked at Qin Yu with admiration. With a single blow, all the members of the Skeleton Gang fell.

“The Skeleton Gang has been around for a long time. There might be even more powerful people under them. I heard that the gang leader, Biao Sang, has reached the peak of the True Saint Realm. Moreover, the information transmission between the warship is instantaneous. I’m afraid some members are rushing toward here right now! ” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Uncle Qun said with a face full of worry.

“It’s fine. Even if the gang leader comes, I will defeat him!”

Qin Yu said indifferently and signed. The gang leader was only at the True Saint Realm.

The spiritual energy in this corner of the galaxy seemed sparse and difficult for formidable individuals to emerge.

Uncle Qun nodded and sighed slightly.

There must be a reason that the Skeleton Gang could exist for so long, even though Qin Yu had just displayed terrifying strength.

But so what? That was a gang!

“If I want to find out more about the Holy Region, where is the best place to go?”

Qin Yu looked at Uncle Qun’s expression and knew what he was worried about.

“The closest place from here is the Black Platform galaxy, two ship years away. It serves as a supply station where people from the various galaxies gather, including merchants who sell information.”

Uncle Qun thought for a moment and said.

“But as far as I know, there’s a Skeleton Gang stronghold there.”

“It’s fine.”

Qin Yu moved and appeared on the Skeleton Gang’s warship.

As far as his eyes could see, five people with strength and status were on the ship.

“Do you know how to sail? I want to go to the Black Platform!”

“Yes! Yes! However, Sir has just damaged the warship. It will take half a year to repair!”

A skinny and weak-looking person with a sharp mouth and monkey-like cheeks quickly spoke. A subtle smirk curled up at the corners of his mouth, barely noticeable.

He had just sent out the information about this place. Soon, the people from the Skeleton Gang nearby would arrive. At that time, they would kill this arrogant guy.

“Half a year? Then what’s the use of keeping you alive?”

These small actions were clearly seen in Qin Yu’s divine sense. Qin Yu directly smashed the head of this minion with a slap.

He did not have much time to waste. Thinking about how Yan Ruoxue had sacrificed so much for him, Qin Yu felt a pain in his chest.
