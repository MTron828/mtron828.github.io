Chapter 192: Storm Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The two of them held the Marrow Pill and looked at it carefully, their eyes filled with curiosity.

“This small pill can actually solve an international problem? It’s really unbelievable,” Peter muttered softly.

His words were full of doubt, but Qin Yu didn’t care.

If he hadn’t experienced all this, Qin Yu probably wouldn’t have believed it himself.

Then, Qin Yu took the Impulse Protection Pill and walked to Yang Xiao.

He put his hand on Yang Xiao’s chest. After a while, Yang Xiao’s mouth opened slightly.

Qin Yu quickly put the Impulse Protection Pill into Yang Xiao’s mouth and used his Qi to move the Impulse Protection Pill into his body.

“It’s done.” After doing all this, Qin Yu looked at Yang Jing.

“I’ve done what I need to do. The rest is up to you,” said Qin Yu.

Yang Jing nodded and said, “Let’s go. I’ve asked someone to prepare a dinner party. Let’s talk while we eat.”

“I have to refuse your invitation.” Qin Yu shook his head. “I’ve gotta go back immediately.”

Yang Jing said in surprise, “Why are you in such a hurry? I was thinking of taking you out to paint the town red.”

Qin Yu muttered, “I don’t know why, but I have a bad feeling.”

This feeling was so strong that Qin Yu had to be vigilant.

Updates by

Yang Jing saw that Qin Yu was determined to leave, so she didn’t ask him to stay any longer.

Qin Yu walked out of the villa followed by a few people.

Then, Qin Yu took back his phone.

As soon as he switched on the phone, he saw several messages coming in.

Some messages were from Wei Jiang, Uncle Wu, and Wei Ming.

“Qin Yu, Jiang Gu has come out of seclusion. He has already entered the Great Grandmaster Realm. Remember, don’t come back,” Uncle Wu said in the message.

“Qin Yu, did you really run away? Now, the whole of Chuzhou is talking about it. Everyone related to you has been suppressed by the Jiang family. Wei Ming was even severely injured...” Wei Jiang wrote in the message.

Seeing the contents of the text message, Qin Yu’s face instantly turned extremely red.

“Jiang Gu... came out of seclusion at a time like this,” Qin Yu whispered.

He hurriedly looked at Yang Jing and said, “I have to go back immediately. Does your family have a private plane?”

Yang Jing rolled her eyes and said, “Private plane? Do you think my family is the richest in the country?”

Qin Yu was not in the mood to joke with her, so he urged her, “Then help me book a ticket immediately. The sooner, the better!”

“What happened?” Xu Maojun said with some surprise.

Qin Yu waved his hand and did not explain.

Then, he got into Yang Jing’s car and rushed to the airport.

On the way, Qin Yu called Uncle Wu.

The call was picked up in a short while.

Uncle Wu said anxiously, “Qin Yu, where have you been these past few days? Why did you fall out of touch?”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “I went out to attend to something. What’s the situation in Chuzhou Now?”

Uncle Wu was silent for a moment, then he sighed and said, “In short, don’t come back now. I’ll try my best to deal with it.”

“No.” Qin Yu was a little angry.

“Uncle Wu, I hope you can tell me the truth.” Qin Yu’s tone was a bit cold.

Hearing Qin Yu’s voice, Uncle Wu sighed and say, “Jiang Gu is looking for you. The people related to you have been suppressed to different degrees.”

“Wei Ming was beaten into a vegetable. Wei Jiang was temporarily suspended from his job. Now, Jiang Gu... has gone to Jiangcheng.”

Qin Yu’s face instantly turned extremely pale!

Anger instantly filled his chest!

“Qin Yu, in short, don’t come back now,” Uncle Wu said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He suppressed his anger and said, “Uncle Wu, help me do something.”

“Tell me,” Uncle Wu agreed.

“Go and tell Jiang Gu that I’ll take the responsibility myself. It has nothing to do with others. At most one day, I will rush back to Jiangcheng,” Qin Yu said coldly.

On the other end, Uncle Wu turned pale with fright. He hurriedly said, “Are you crazy? Jiang Gu now is a genuine grandmaster. If you come back, you’ll die for sure!”

“Even if I die, I won’t let others die for me!” Qin Yu said coldly. “Moreover, Jiang Gu isn’t all that. He might not be able to kill me.”

Uncle Wu tried to persuade Qin Yu to change his mind but to no avail.

Uncle Wu had no choice but to agree.

After hanging up the phone, Qin Yu looked at Yang Jing and said, “Please Drive Faster.”

...

Jiangcheng.

The news of Jiang Gu’s arrival instantly spread throughout the whole city.

The higher-ups immediately stopped Qin Yu’s factory in order to calm things down.

The people who were related to Qin Yu were also in a panic at this moment.

“Brother Hu, I heard that Jiang Gu is ruthless and full of tricks. Should we hide?” In Lei Hu’s office, one of his subordinates said in a deep voice.

Lei Hu’s expression was extremely pale.

How could he not be afraid!

If people were asked about who was the person closest to Qin Yu in Jiangcheng, everyone would answer it was him, Lei Hu!

It was very likely that Jiang Gu would kill him to threaten others! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“No.” After hesitating over and over again, Lei Hu still shook his head. “If I leave, the ones who will suffer will probably be others.”

Lei Hu’s underling muttered, “Brother Hu, Qin Yu has already run away, why should we stay here? Speaking of which, Qin Yu is such a selfish coward ..”

Lei Hu glared at him and berated, “Don’t talk nonsense! I believe that Mr. Qin is not that kind of person!”

That said, Lei Hu was still a little worried internally.

In the past few days, he had heard lots of news from Chuzhou.

Even those who were not very close to Qin Yu were severely injured.

Yet, Qin Yu never showed up.

Although Lei Hu wanted to believe Qin Yu with all his heart, the fact made him a bit worried.

“Opportunities and risks coexist. That’s the old saying we should believe.” Lei Hu gritted his teeth.

“If I can stand up for Mr. Qin this time, I may seize the greatest opportunity in my life!” Lei Hu stood up and made up his mind.

It was very hard for him to further climb the social ladder. This position may be the highest one he could reach.

But who didn’t have ambition? Who didn’t want to be a big shot who could almost dominate the whole country?

...

Su family.

Su Wen and Sun Yumei were sitting at home watching TV.

As two ordinary citizens, they naturally didn’t know anything about Jiang Gu.

The two of them were eating watermelon in early autumn while watching the soap opera on TV.

At this moment, a Rolls-royce Guste pulled up at the door.

When the car stopped, they saw Jiang Gu and uncle Zhong get out of the car.

“Master, this is Qin Yu’s original family,” Uncle Zhong said.

Jiang Gu snorted and said, “Since it’s his original family, it must be very important to Qin Yu. Let’s start with them.”

“Yes.” Uncle Zhong nodded slightly.

Jiang Gu and Uncle Zhong pushed open the gate and strode in.

As soon as they entered, Sun Yumei stared at Jiang Gu.

“Who are you? Who let you in?”Sun Yumei frowned and asked.

Jiang Gu glanced at them and said indifferently, “Is this Qin Yu’s home?”

At the mention of Qin Yu, Sun Yumei was so angry that she couldn’t even speak.

“You are Qin Yu’s friends, right? Let me tell you, get out of Here!” Sun Yumei yelled in a huff.
