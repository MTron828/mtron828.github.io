Chapter 2039: The Clash of the Nine Great Aristocratic Families

Si Liuhe also said, “That’s right. Without our Si family, you wouldn’t even qualify to enter the Chaos Grave. How could you talk about the treasures?”

“Is that so? What? Is your Si family the only chaotic body in the world?” Yan Guyun sneered.

“Senior Guyun is right. If I’m not wrong, Qin Yu must be here as well,” Yao Xi bowed slightly and said.

Hearing this, Jiang He’s expression was slightly unnatural.

He and Qin Yu were old friends and were even close friends. He had naturally heard of Qin Yu’s matters.

“Qin Yu must be here. As a chaotic body, he won’t give up on this opportunity,” Yan Yunfan said coldly.

“Qin Yu is your competitor. Si Shiyue, don’t think too highly of yourself.”

Si Shiyue suddenly released a terrifying internal qi. He stepped forward and shouted, “Yan Yunfan, I don’t mind using you to exhibit my power before entering the Chaos Grave!”

“Do you think I’m afraid of you?” Yan Yunfan also shouted, and a terrifying internal qi suddenly burst out from the two.

The two internal qi intersected, and the surrounding void continued to collapse!

They didn’t hide anything from their conversation, thus almost everyone could hear them clearly. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Qin Yu’s expression was a little ugly. He gritted his teeth and could not help but curse inwardly, “This bunch of b*stards. Why are you talking about me?”

“Before the Chaos Grve opens, it’s best not to make a move.” At this moment, Saintess Gu shook her head and stood in front of them.

Yan Guyun sneered and said, “How about this? Before we enter the Chaos Grave, let’s find out where Qin Yu is. We can then use his blood to enter the Chaos Grave.”

The moment these words came out, Qin Yu’s expression immediately became even uglier, and he became even more flustered!

If they did so, they would soon discover Qin Yu’s figure. That would be troublesome!

“Everyone, don’t be angry. In my opinion, it’s better to sit down and talk,” Jiang He spoke at this moment.

“Talk?” Yan Guyun sneered and said. “How? Brother Liuhe, tell us. What kind of reply do you plan to give us?”

Si Liuhe remained silent. The Si family had to get the chaotic body no matter what price they had to pay.

Everyone knew this very well, thus they dared to keep increasing the pressure.

“I want to ask everyone a question,” Si Liuhe said.

Everyone nodded slightly, indicating for him to continue.

“This is a Tribulation Stage great cultivator’s Chaos Grave,” Si Liuhe said coldly.

“I think you all know what it means for a chaotic body to reach the Tribulation Stage.”

“That’s right. When the chaotic body has reached the Tribulation Stage, it has reached the Great Success Stage. A Great Success Stage chaotic body is not something that other Tribulation Stage cultivators can compare to,” Si Shiyue added.

Yan Yunfan sneered and said, “That’s just a rumor. I have the blood of my Immortal Emperor ancestor in my body. I’m not afraid of your bullsh*t chaotic body.”

Si Shiyue looked at Yan Yunfan coldly and said, “Don’t worry. I’ll satisfy you. There’s no need to be anxious.”

“Great! I will personally shatter that bullsh*t myth of a chaotic body! ” Yan Yunfan did not back down.

Si Liuhe waved his hand and said in a deep voice, “A Great Success Stage chaotic body naturally has countless followers. As for the treasures, without me elaborating, everyone should know.

“There are countless tribulation magical artifacts alone. In addition, I think there are also many tens of thousands-year-old Divine Medicines.

“Of course, I’m only talking about a small portion. The nine sanctums are enough to sustain a large sect for thousands of years.

“Our Si family doesn’t need any of these. We only want the corpse of the chaotic body. Isn’t that good enough?”

Any one of the treasures Si Liuhe mentioned was enough to shock the entire Holy Region.

However, compared to the corpse of the chaotic body, they were insignificant.

“The Si family isn’t sincere enough,” Yao Xi said, smiling faintly.

Si Liuhe frowned. He looked at Yao Xi with displeasure.

Although Yao Xi had come on behalf of the Yao family, he was only a junior after all. How could he tolerate the fact that he did not show him any respect?

“Senior Liuhe, you seem to have forgotten one thing. This Chaos Grave doesn’t belong to your Si family, and the treasures inside don’t belong to you either. Naturally, you don’t need to distribute them,” Yao Xi continued.

“It’s our own ability to get these treasures, not your Si family’s charity.”

“Since we get them ourselves, how can it be considered as the sincerity of the Si family?”

Yao Xi’s words immediately gained the approval of Yan Guyun and the others. They all nodded in agreement.

Si Liuhe frowned even more. He knew these people were pressing the Si family because of the family’s earnest need for the corpse of the chaotic body.

However, Si Liuhe also knew they had to get the corpse of the chaotic body that was crucial to the Si family. Under such circumstances, he could only compromise for now.

“Then tell us what you want. I think we’ll agree as long as it’s not too much.” Si Liuhe took a deep breath.

At this point, Si Liuhe looked at Yan Guyun and reminded him, “The Si family and the Yan Family have been friends for generations. Our friendship will only grow deeper in the future.”

But Yan Guyun turned a deaf ear to him. He didn’t like Yan Ruoxue, so he didn’t care about befriending them.

“I think it’s better for Senior Liuhe to tell us. You’re a senior. As juniors, how would we dare to say anything?” Yao Xi smiled.

Si Liuhe couldn’t help cursing in his heart.

Now he knew he was a senior? He didn’t behave like this just now.

Even so, Si Liuhe did not have much choice.

He could only take a deep breath and say, “Alright, the Si family is willing to pay 100 billion spirit coins, 20 tens of thousands-year-old Divine Medicines, and a tribulation magical artifact.”

“Hehe!” Yan Guyun sneered. “Do you think we’re beggars?”

“Then what do you want? I’m warning you, don’t go too far. At most, we’ll go our separate ways!” Si Liuhe shouted, and the aura on his body suddenly exploded!

This man had once swept across the entire universe, so his strength was evident. Even Yan Guyun couldn’t help but be stunned by his aura.

...

As for Yao Xi and the others, they didn’t dare to say anything. There was nothing they could do if Si Liuhe went crazy and killed them.

“I think everyone should calm down and discuss it later.” Saintess Gu walked out at the right time.

She smiled and said, “Let’s discuss it among ourselves. We’ll come up with our own conditions and negotiate when the time comes.. How about that?”
