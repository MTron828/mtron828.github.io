Chapter 2050: The Undercurrent

The woman did not react to Jue Wu’s curses.

She still made eyes at Qin Yu and did not conceal the charm in her eyes.

Qin Yu frowned. Looking at the woman opposite him, Qin Yu felt a sense of familiarity.

“Who are you?” Qin Yu asked.

!!

The woman didn’t answer. Instead, she slowly got up and leaned toward Qin Yu’s ear.

However, at this moment, Jue Wu suddenly made a move and slapped her with her palm!

Just as the palm was about to hit her, her body suddenly emitted rays of light! Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The light enveloped her like a layer of armor wanting to block Jue Wu’s palm!

“Clang!”

With a loud noise, the light on the woman’s body shattered! Her body even staggered back a few steps!

“What a tyrannical power!” The woman looked somewhat surprised at Jue Wu.

Jue Wu wrinkled her nose and said, “I actually didn’t slap you to death…”

“This little girl indeed needs to be disciplined,” the woman’s tone was cold, and the internal qi on her body began to rise.

Qin Yu stood up and stood between the two of them.

He looked at the woman and said coldly, “If you dare to attack Jue Wu, I guarantee I will kill you right now.”

Qin Yu possessed a Saint Weapon and definitely would not be afraid of this woman.

“Don’t get too agitated.” When the woman saw this, the ferocious internal qi on her body began to disappear, and her flirtatious appearance resumed.

“Who are you?” Qin Yu looked at her coldly. “What’s your purpose for getting close to me?” Seeing Qin Yu not easy to deal with, this woman straightaway tore off her hypocritical face.

Sitting opposite Qin Yu, she said indifferently, “Qin Yu, I know your identity.”

Hearing his name called out, Qin Yu was not surprised.

Since she came close to him, she must have known his identity.

“So?” Qin Yu said coldly.

“I want to cooperate with you.” The woman took out a cigarette holder from her sleeve and started smoking. A faint fragrance was nose-assailing.

Qin Yu sniffed and then frowned.

“You want to cooperate with me? How?” Qin Yu questioned.

“I know you are a chaotic body,” the woman said with a faint smile. “There are only two chaotic bodies in the world, you and Si Shiyue. But…”

“Get to the point,” Qin Yu interrupted her.

“I need your blood to enter the Chaos Grave,” the woman said in a deep voice. “And you can’t enter without my help.”

“I don’t think there’s a need for that. I have my way of dealing with the Chaos Grave,” Qin Yu sneered and said.

“Is that so?” The woman raised her eyebrows. “What if I insist that we must cooperate?”

“I dislike being threatened,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“There are many things you dislike. How can everything go your way in this world?” she said indifferently.

“For example, right now, you’ve been poisoned. If you don’t cooperate with me, I’m afraid you will die here. That little girl should be collapsing soon.” Qin Yu’s expression turned even colder instantly.

He looked at the cigarette holder in her hand and instantly understood everything.

However, as time passed, Jue Wu showed no signs of collapsing. Instead, she was full of vigor and battle intent.

This immediately made the flirtatious woman frown. She grabbed the cigarette holder, took a closer look, and said in a low voice, “What happened?”

“Hmph!” Qin Yu sneered and said. “Looks like your poison isn’t as effective as I thought. Were you tricked by someone?”

A trace of anger flashed across the flirtations woman’s face. She stood up and said, “Impossible!

This is absolutely impossible!”

“Idiot! Jue Wu is a Nirvana Body. Your bullsh*t poison is useless,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“What about you? Why aren’t you reacting?” the flirtatious woman said unwillingly.

“I’ve been deceived since the first day I stepped into the Holy Region,” Qin Yu sneered and said. “That’s why I’m naturally wary of any stranger.”

“From the moment you took out this broken cigarette holder, I had already sealed the internal qi in my body. How could I have been poisoned?”

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, the flirtatious woman instantly flew into a rage, feeling humiliated.

She slammed the table and stood up. She glared at Qin Yu and scolded, “Qin Yu, without me, you would never have been able to step into the Chaos Grave and obtain Wu Ji’s secret burial!”

“Is that so? Let’s give it a try,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

“Just you wait!” the flirtatious woman gritted her teeth and said.

After saying this, she turned around and was about to leave. At this moment, Jue Wu stepped forward and blocked her way.

“Did I let you go?” Jue Wu said with a dark face.

Her body emitted a purple arrogance. The arrogance was surging, and it gave off an oppressive feeling.

“Jue Wu, let her go.” At this moment, Qin Yu waved her hand.

The flirtatious woman snorted coldly. She did not stay any longer and turned around to leave.

After she left, Jue Wu said in confusion, “Why didn’t you kill her? If she spreads your identity everywhere, won’t you be in trouble?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “This woman’s strength is not simple, and… She’s definitely not alone. I’m afraid there’re some mysterious sects or aristocratic families behind her.

“Moreover, it won’t be that easy to take her down in a short time. In this situation, there will be more complications.”

Jue Wu nodded and sat beside Qin Yu.

Qin Yu was not worried about his identity at all.

In any case, he could enter the Chaos Grave directly through the formation of the man with the mustache. Coupled with the sky-concealing formation, even the people of the nine great aristocratic families would find it hard to detect his figure.

“Why isn’t that b*stard with the mustache here yet?” Qin Yu could not help but mutter.

This place was no longer safe. With Qin Yu’s method of concealing internal qi, he would be discovered soon.

Qin Yu would definitely become a popular person during the opening of the Chaos Grave. After all, the blood essence of this chaotic body was the ticket to enter the Chaos Grave.

As expected, several internal qis surrounded Qin Yu very quickly. It was as if numerous eyes were staring coldly at Qin Yu in the dark.

“This bunch of b*stards…” Jue Wu couldn’t help but curse in a low voice.

Qin Yu looked rather calm. He picked up the wine on the table and took a sip before closing his eyes slightly.

“Since you’re here, don’t hide anymore.”

After a while, Qin Yu suddenly spoke.

Before he finished speaking, the surrounding void began to tremble.

Then a group of people walked out.

This seemed to be just the beginning. The surrounding void continued to surge as more people walked out.

One group, two groups, three groups…

More than a dozen groups of people came out of the void in the blink of an eye. The small tavern suddenly became even more crowded.

Jue Wu slammed the table and stood up. She glanced at everyone and shouted, “What do you want?”
