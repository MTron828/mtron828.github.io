As expected!

This old man was not from the South Province at all!

With his strength, he was far above the three maniacs and three uniques. How could such an existence come from the South Province! !

Qin Yu looked at the old man, cupped his hands and said, “Senior, are you from the Central Province?” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The old man raised his eyebrows and said, “You know quite a lot.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but think to himself, “As expected, the top people all come from the Central Plains...”

Thinking of this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but think of Chang Mang and the others.

He didn’t know if they had already gone to the Central Plains, and he didn’t know what realm they had reached.

“Do you really want to refer to this Beast Spirit Pill Formula?”At this time, the old man suddenly asked.

Qin Yu was delighted and hurriedly nodded, “Senior, if you are willing, I really want to read it.”

“Then follow me,”the old man said indifferently.

Qin Yu was overjoyed. He didn’t expect that the old man would be so generous.

“Thank you, Senior!”Qin Yu cupped his hands and said while holding back his excitement.

......

Then, Qin Yu followed behind the old man and walked forward.

The old man’s footsteps were extremely fast, as if the shrinking ground into an inch. Even though Qin Yu was desperately chasing behind him, he was still left behind by a large distance.

With no other choice, Qin Yu could only activate the line word formula and quickly chased after him.

Seeing Qin Yu chasing after him, the old man’s eyes were clearly a little shocked.

“Line word formula of nine secrets?”The old man said with some surprise.

Qin Yu didn’t hide anything and nodded. “Senior, what I used was indeed the line word formula of nine secrets. I got it by chance.”

“It seems that you have a lot of secrets,”the old man said indifferently.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly. Even if the old man wanted Qin Yu to teach him the line word formula by force, Qin Yu had no choice but to obey obediently.

Fortunately, the old man did not say anything. He let Qin Yu follow behind him and sped off to a certain place.

Soon, the two of them arrived at a small farmhouse.

The decoration of this small courtyard was extremely simple, just like the residence of an old man in a farm.

After arriving at this small courtyard, the old man did not waste any time. He took out the Beast Spirit Pill formula and handed it to Qin Yu.

“I’ll give you three days at most. After three days, regardless of whether you can read it or not, you must return it to me,”said the old man.

Qin Yu took the Beast Spirit Pill formula. He suppressed his excitement and nodded. “Thank you, senior.”

The old man nodded slightly, then turned around and went to his room.

Qin Yu took the Beast Spirit Pill formula and sat cross-legged in the courtyard.

He didn’t waste any time and immediately began to read the spirit pill recipe.

With Qin Yu’s ability, it wasn’t difficult for him to read a pill recipe.

But when Qin Yu opened the spirit pill recipe, he realized that it wasn’t that simple.

The Spirit Pill recipe was extremely responsible. Because it involved the physique of a demonic beast, it was extremely difficult for cultivators to comprehend it.

Qin Yu stared at the spirit pill recipe and couldn’t help but frown.

He tried to read the pill recipe, but found that his mind was blank, and he couldn’t read it at all.

“How could this be...”Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

This spirit pill wasn’t some top-tier medicinal pill. It was only a black grade medicinal pill, but its effect was beyond imagination.

Compared to the Spirit Pill on Earth, this spirit pill was obviously purer, and its effect was completely different.

In the dark, the old man secretly observed Qin Yu.

Seeing Qin Yu’s furrowed brows, the old man couldn’t help but smile.

“Looks like this kid is unable to comprehend this pill formula,”the old man thought to himself.

Then, he slightly closed his eyes and no longer paid attention to Qin Yu.

An entire day and night.

Qin Yu’s eyes didn’t leave this pill formula.

He tried to use a strand of divine sense to evolve the pill formula, but in the end, he failed.

“Strange...”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

Every step he took was done according to the requirements of the pill formula, but in the end, he failed.

It was as if he was separated by a layer of window paper. No matter what, he couldn’t see through it.

“How is it? Do you want to rest for a while?”

The old man’s voice came from behind.

Qin Yu shook his head with a bitter smile. “No, it’s just three days. I’d better hurry up.”

The old man said indifferently, “It’s impossible to comprehend the pill formula by building a cart behind closed doors. There are some things that can be comprehended means that it can be comprehended. If it can’t be comprehended, then no matter how much effort you put in, it’s useless.”

Qin Yu didn’t think so in his heart. He firmly believed that diligence could make up for clumsiness.

Moreover, Qin Yu wasn’t an ordinary person.

He immediately closed his eyes and continued to comprehend the pill formula.

Meanwhile, the old man was quietly watching from the side.

Qin Yu’s brows were sometimes locked and sometimes relaxed. At other times, his forehead was covered with sweat, and at other times, he was shivering.

No one knew to what extent Qin Yu had comprehended the pill formula at this moment.

In the blink of an eye, another day had passed.

Qin Yu was still sitting there with his legs crossed. He had no intention of leaving.

The old man shook his head slowly. Tomorrow was the day of the replenishing pill. In his eyes, Qin Yu had no chance.

“Three days... it’s hard on him,”the old man said in his heart.

Although he said that he didn’t rely on time to comprehend the pill formula, in reality, he was just looking at Qin Yu’s performance.

Who knew how many alchemists had spent decades or even hundreds of years to comprehend a pill formula.

Now, Qin Yu had to spend three days to comprehend the Beast Spirit Pill. This was naturally not easy.

The old man looked at Qin Yu and did not say anything.

Of course, he knew how difficult it was to comprehend the Beast Spirit Pill in three days. However, it was naturally not that easy to be chosen by such a person.

As time passed by, the old man did not seem to have any hope.

He shook his head, turned around and returned to his room, quietly waiting for the time to come.

The next day, the old man completely gave up hope.

He walked out of the room and found a cauldron in front of Qin Yu.

Qin Yu was inside the cauldron, fiddling with something.

Seeing the old man walking out, Qin Yu quickly took out a beast spirit pill from the cauldron.

“Senior, this is the beast spirit pill that I refined!”Qin Yu said excitedly.

A trace of surprise flashed in the old man’s eyes.

This kid actually comprehended the Beast Spirit Pill Formula? He even refined a beast spirit pill?

In just three days, he really did it?

The Old Man took the Beast Spirit Pill from Qin Yu’s hand and carefully sized it up.

He put it on his nose and sniffed it. A trace of joy appeared on his face.

“Not bad. The quality of this beast spirit pill can be considered top-notch,”the old man said with a sigh.

He didn’t expect that he would have such an unexpected harvest after coming to the South Province.

Qin Yu returned the recipe for the Beast Spirit Pill to the old man with both hands and said, “Thank you for your help, senior. Qin Yu is eternally grateful.”

The old man raised his eyebrows and said, “You are Qin Yu?”
