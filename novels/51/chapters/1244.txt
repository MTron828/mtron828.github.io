Chapter 1245: Chapter 1,245, the ancient array platform without any movement 

But to Jiang Yi, this was undoubtedly a humiliation.

His eyes were bloodshot as he stared at Qin Yu, who was sitting cross-legged, and his fists were clenched tightly.

“Qin Yu, I want you to die! I want you to die! ! !”

His hoarse voice shook the heaven and earth.

Countless people vomited blood due to the strong spiritual power.

Those who were weaker were directly turned into a bloody mist at this moment!

Jiang Yi’s anger had obviously reached its peak.

What was shocking was that his spiritual power seemed to have become even stronger under the control of his anger!

Jiang Yi was extremely smart. His speed of forming seals was not any slower than a true mighty realm cultivator.

In the blink of an eye, Jiang Yi had already slapped down dozens of spells and bombarded Qin Yu with them!

Fortunately, Jiang Yi was not a bloodthirsty person. He focused all his spells on Qin Yu.

In this way, he could ensure that the power of the spells could be unleashed to the maximum, and at the same time, he could avoid hurting innocent people.

Jiang Yi did not know how many spells he had cast in one breath. That area had already turned into ruins.

The people hiding in the dark to watch the battle were even more shocked.

They all broke out in cold sweat for Qin Yu. Even though they believed that Qin Yu’s physical body was indestructible, they were still suspicious at this moment.

“The spells this time seem to be a few times stronger than before!”

“Under this indiscriminate bombardment, even a mighty realm cultivator at his peak would find it difficult to escape unscathed.”

“Qin Yu... is he really going to use this to temper his body?”

The area was covered in smoke, blocking everyone’s line of sight.

However, their gazes never left Qin Yu’s direction.

Everyone’s eyes widened. They didn’t even dare to Blink, afraid that they would miss out on a wonderful scene.

The smoke finally gradually settled down.

Qin Yu’s surroundings had all collapsed by dozens of meters. It looked extremely terrifying.

However, the ground under Qin Yu’s butt was completely undamaged.

It looked like a pillar that had suddenly risen from the ground. It looked extremely strange.

Qin Yu’s body was already stained with a few traces of blood.

Fresh blood flowed on Qin Yu’s body. This was enough to prove that Qin Yu was also injured.

However... This injury was not serious at all. It was far from what everyone had expected!

Qin Yu sat there cross-legged, his eyes still slightly closed.

The injuries on his body did not seem to cause any substantial harm to him. In fact, he even looked a little comfortable.

Qin Yu opened his eyes slightly.

He raised his head to look at Jiang Yi and said indifferently, “Not bad. To be able to unleash such power under anger, no wonder senior Jiang he thinks so highly of you.”

It was originally a compliment, but to Jiang Yi’s ears, it sounded extremely harsh.

“Come, continue.”Qin Yu closed his eyes again.

The injuries on his body were slowly recovering, as if they had been tempered.

This made Jiang Yi feel a strong sense of defeat!

He had prepared for so long, but he couldn’t hurt Qin Yu at all!

“F * ck...”

Even Jiang Yi, who didn’t swear, couldn’t help but swear at this moment.

He looked at Qin Yu coldly, and countless thoughts flashed through his mind.

He knew that if he continued, there wouldn’t be any result. On the contrary, he would add more shame to himself.

“Phew...”

Jiang Yi let out a long breath.

He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “You are indeed stronger than I thought, but I don’t think you are stronger than me. Qin Yu, we will meet again in the future. I Won’t let you off so easily.”

After saying that, Jiang Yi turned around and left in an extremely straightforward manner.

He turned into a streak of light and disappeared from everyone’s sight in an instant.

The people watching the battle in the dark couldn’t help but sigh.

Although the winner and loser weren’t decided, everyone knew who was stronger and who was weaker.

“It won’t be so easy to shake Qin Yu’s position.”

“Yeah, if he had attacked from the beginning, Jiang Yi would have already died.”

If that punch containing divine power landed on Jiang Yi’s face, his head would probably be smashed into pieces.

“This Qin Yu can’t use his spiritual power. Otherwise, God knows how powerful he will be.”

“That’s right. Once he has the support of spiritual power, the mighty realm is probably not worth mentioning.”

The crowd discussed among themselves and slowly left from the dark.

The scene quickly returned to silence.

Zhen Yue and Di Zun stood at the edge of the big pit and shouted, “How are you? Are You Okay?”

Qin Yu opened his eyes slightly and shook his head.

He glanced at the ruins around him and couldn’t help but sigh in his heart.

“If this Jiang Yi is nurtured more, I’m afraid he will be limitless in the future,”Qin Yu thought in a low voice.

He regarded Qin Yu as his opponent, which also stimulated his fighting spirit.

As for him, who was unwilling to admit defeat, he would probably work even harder.

“He actually developed such a spell by himself. What a terrifying and respectable opponent,”Qin Yu sighed.

It was a pity that Jiang Yi met Qin Yu.

To Jiang Yi, this was both unfortunate and fortunate.

As he fled, a trace of unwillingness flashed across his face.

“Damn it, damn it!”Jiang Yi clenched his fists and cursed in his heart.

“Qin Yu, just you wait. One day, I will defeat you in my hands. I will! !”

...

Qin Yu slowly stood up. With a jolt of his feet, he jumped to the edge of the Big Pit. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The Moment Qin Yu left, what was left of the pillar instantly shattered.

“Master, are... are your wounds okay?”Di Zun asked tentatively.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I’m fine.”

“You’d better go back to your room quickly. I’ll take care of you so you don’t get infected.”Zhen Yue took out a handkerchief and wiped Qin Yu’s wounds.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but smile bitterly.

His body was invulnerable, so how could he get infected.

However, Zhen Yue insisted. Qin Yu had no choice but to follow her back to the hall and wipe the wounds on his body.

After she was done, Zhen Yue couldn’t help but sigh. “I have a feeling that this person will come again.”

“It doesn’t matter,”Qin Yu said with a smile.

“I do want a worthy opponent.”

At this moment, Qin Yu even had the idea of bringing Jiang Yi to the saint-level.

Firstly, it was because of Jiang he, and secondly, Jiang Yi’s talent shouldn’t be wasted.

Qin Yu returned to his room. He tore off the bandage that Zhen Yue had tied around his body and looked down at his wounds.

The wounds on his body were shocking. The deepest one was so deep that one could almost see his sparkling white bones.

This was undoubtedly a pleasant surprise to Qin Yu.

“This Jiang Yi is really terrifying,”Qin Yu muttered.

It was rare to see someone who could hurt him in this world, unless he borrowed some top-notch spiritual artifact.

This made Qin Yu admire Jiang Yi even more.

The next day.

Qin Yu hurried back to the first mystic realm.

He wasn’t worried about Jiang Yi. This kid only wanted to defeat Qin Yu, and he wouldn’t do anything despicable.

“Phew, it’s time for me to go into seclusion,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He put the blood back into the bathtub and soaked his entire body in it.

The blood in the bathtub boiled in an instant.

Then, as if it had gained its own consciousness, it kept surging toward Qin Yu.

The blood passed through Qin Yu’s pores and entered his blood vessels, becoming one with his blood.

The fusion of blood was an extremely long process.

To others, the fusion of blood was extremely painful, but Qin Yu did not feel any pain at all. On the contrary, it was as if he was soaking in a hot spring, warm and comfortable.

Although there was not much blood left, the speed of the fusion was extremely slow.

It would take at least ten days to half a month to completely fuse the blood.

Fortunately, Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry. As long as he could complete the fusion before the opening of the Holy Region, it would be enough.

At this moment, near the eighteen array platforms.

Every reclusive almighty was guarding one of them, but in the blink of an eye, they had already been waiting for an entire month.

During this month, the ancient array platform was extremely calm, without the slightest change.
