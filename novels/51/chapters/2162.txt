2163 The Pursuit!

Hearing Qin Yu’s words, the two instantly burst into laughter.

“Although we don’t know what’s wrong with Yan Tianshi, you can’t leave here alive!” an elderly man laughed out loud.

Qin Yu looked at the two coldly and said sarcastically, “That’s why you can never accomplish Yan Tianshi’s achievements!”

Faced with Qin Yu’s ridicule, the two were not angry at all. Instead, they said indifferently, “So what? No one knows what achievements we can accomplish, and no one can see the future. But we can see your future!”

With two True Saints blocking Qin Yu’s way, this undoubtedly was a tremendous disaster.

With Qin Yu’s strength, he absolutely could not defeat them.

“I can only think of a way to escape.” Qin Yu turned to look at the warship.

Since this warship was once used by Immortal Emperor Lei when he was traveling, it was definitely not an ordinary ship. He could take this opportunity to escape.

Qin Yu looked at the other party’s warship. It was incredibly luxurious and totally different from the warship of Immortal Emperor Lei. The luxury on the ship was unimaginable.

However, it was precisely because of this that the warship became bloated. The warship of Lei Ming was obviously practical.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu did not talk nonsense. He quietly mobilized the internal qi in his body and spread it throughout the entire warship.

In an instant, the warship was enveloped by Qin Yu’s internal qi and resonated with the activation formation. At this moment, Qin Yu seemed to have integrated with the warship.

Rays of Golden Light began to appear on the warship. The golden light exploded into a dazzling light in the dark void!

“D*mn it! This kid wants to escape!” That elderly man instantly understood Qin Yu’s intention. His feet immediately shook, and he shot explosively in Qin Yu’s direction!

Qin Yu dared not waste time. He closed his eyes and focused on controlling the warship to shoot into the distance!

The warship streaked across the void, leaving behind a golden trail. The warship sped through the void, and the golden light streaked across the boundless darkness like a meteor crossing the galaxy.

The wind blew past Qin Yu’s face, bringing with it the internal qi of the universe. The stars swiftly flashed past his eyes, and the starlight swept past his body like dazzling sparks. It was as if he had merged with the rhythm of the universe and existed with the stars.

Qin Yu dared not be negligent at all. Those were two True Saints. Once they caught up, he would definitely die!

Looking at the warship that was shooting away, the two elderly men’s faces turned ashen. The elderly man who had originally planned to chase after Qin Yu also stopped in his tracks.

He stood in the boundless void and said coldly, “Chase him! We can’t let his kid escape!”

The warship sped through the void. The golden light illuminated the surrounding darkness, causing the void to tremble. The wind whistled, and the stars flickered beside the warship as if cheering for it.

The two elders did not hesitate and swiftly chased after the warship. Their bodies were like lightning as they transformed into flowing lights that shuttled through the galaxy. Their speed was astonishing, but the warship seemed to have a magic power that caused them unable to catch up, constantly extending the distance away from them.

Qin Yu was anxious. He focused all his attention on controlling the warship, trying to maximize its speed.

Under his guidance, the warship kept changing directions, nimbly avoiding the pursuit of the two elders.

The golden light flickered like a ray of flowing golden light, full of power and hope.

However, the two elders were too powerful. They used amazing supernatural powers and techniques to try to interfere with the warship’s sailing repeatedly.

Lightning flashed, flames raged, and darkness spread, forming invisible obstructions. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Qin Yu had no choice but to expend a large amount of energy and intelligence to avoid these obstructions at the fastest speed and maintain the warship’s flight.

“Brat, don’t even think about escaping!” The voices of the two elders pierced through everything, causing the entire starry sky to tremble. Terrifying booming sounds continuously entered Qin Yu’s ears, and a tremendously terrifying light even flickered at the back of Qin Yu!

The two elders raised their palms as if activating some terrifying techniques, wanting to destroy Qin Yu’s warship!

Their palms emitted waves of scorching energy fluctuations, forming a blazing net of flames and lightning wrapping around the warship. This energy was full of destructive power that seemed to be able to turn everything into dust.

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. With a roar, the internal qi in his body suddenly erupted. Countless rays of golden lights emitted and enveloped the entire warship!

“Boom!”

Terrifying beams of light shot toward the warship. The two elders seemed to have determined to get rid of Qin Yu. They raised their hands and unleashed terrifying techniques with tremendously destructive power!

The Golden Light in Qin Yu’s body was penetrated almost instantly. With the appearance of cracks, the Golden Light of the entire warship completely dissipated!

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically! That terrifying light was heading straight for the ship!

“Clang!”

The terrifying sound was deafening, and the entire warship was wrapped by that terrifying internal qi. The destructive power entangled the warship and continuously emitted a terrifying sound!

The entire warship continued to shake, and Qin Yu felt unprecedented pressure. This warship was originally controlled by his true essence, and now, all the tremors were resonating with Qin Yu’s body and primordial spirit!

Qin Yu only felt dizzy, and his mind was in a mess. He almost lost control of the warship!

However, he gritted his teeth and relied on his strong willpower to control the warship with difficulty! At this moment, the warship of Lei Ming finally showed its might. It was unknown what terrifying materials were used to make this warship. The terrifying light left wounds on the warship, but there were no signs of it collapsing!

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu’s heart was instantly ignited with hope!

Immortal Emperor Lei’s warship indeed lived up to its reputation! As long as the warship was not destroyed, Qin Yu could rely on his speed to escape this pursuit!

Qin Yu took a deep breath. He controlled the warship with all his might and shot forward at a tremendously fast speed.

The speed of Lei Ming’s warship was tremendously fast. It was not something that the two elders could compare to.

Seeing the warship going farther away, the two elders became increasingly anxious.

“This warship is extraordinary. I wonder where this kid got it from!” an elder gritted his teeth and said.

“It must have been given to him by Dean Lei… We can’t let him escape!” another elder said coldly.

They were tremendously anxious in their hearts. If they continued to chase like this, Qin Yu would definitely escape!

Once they pursued too far away, there was a risk that they could not return to the Holy Region!

Then one of them slowly raised his hand, and terrifying true essence immediately spread out. Even the surrounding void began to collapse!

All of a sudden, boundless starlight gathered around them, forming a giant vortex. This vortex emitted the internal qi of the vast universe, like the center of a galaxy!

At this moment, they were like the masters of the starry sky that seemed to mobilize all the power in the starry sky!
