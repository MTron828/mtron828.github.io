1815 The Invitation Is in the Hand

The man was stunned. He then frowned and said, “What did you say?”

“Nothing. I’ll bring you in later. You don’t even need an invitation,” Qin Yu quickly changed his words.

“Thank you so much!” the man said respectfully.

“My name is Tan Liu. I’m honored to know you,” he introduced himself.

Qin Yu waved his hand. “It’s no big deal. Don’t bother. However, you have to keep my identity a secret.”

“Understood, understood. Brother Yue Tie, don’t worry. I understand,” Tan Liu said with a smile.

Just as he said that the formation was about to activate.

Compared to the formation of Thunder Courtyard, the formation here was a little worn out.

Everyone in the formation was shaking. It was obvious that this formation was not stable at all. If not being careful, an accident could happen, and the people could fall to other places.

Qin Yu was on tenterhooks along the way. It would be troublesome if he was teleported to other places. There were only five days left.

Fortunately, after more than an hour, a few of them successfully landed nearby Mount Taihua.

There were many cities around Mount Taihua. But of course, these cities were clans formed by many cultivators and not full fledge cities.

At a glance, an extremely huge mountain range was in front.

The mountain range stretched for a few hundred li and was surrounded by a dense mist. It was a spectacular sight.

“That’s Mount Taihua,” Tan Liu sighed with emotion and said.

“Speaking of which, this is my first time coming to Mount Taihua.”

Qin Yu calculated the time. It would take two more days for the so-called grand event to start.

Therefore, Qin Yu said to Tan Liu, “Let’s first find a place to stay.”

“Isn’t anyone coming to pick you up?” Tan Liu was a little surprised and asked. “Didn’t they arrange a place for you to stay?”

“Of course, the arrangement has been made. It’s just that many people are coming to Mount Taihua, so I don’t want to trouble Si Shiyue.” Qin Yu made up a story.

“Understood, understood!” Tan Liu said was suddenly enlightened and said.

As long as one had the status, the other party would believe him without hesitation, even if he was talking nonsense.

Qin Yu was well aware of this, so he was not worried.

The two found a place near Mount Taihua and settled down temporarily. Tan Liu even brought good wine and meat to please Qin Yu.

During the meal, Qin Yu’s mind was fully thinking about how to trick Tan Liu into giving him the invitation letter.

It was very unfair, but Qin Yu had no choice but to do this.

“Brother Tan Liu, why did you come to Mount Taihua?” Qin Yu asked.

Tan Liu sighed and said, “Of course, it’s to strive for a chance. If I can enter the Si or Yan family, I can be considered settling well in the future…”

Hearing this, Qin Yu suddenly felt that this was his chance.

“What do you want to do entering the families?” he asked with a smile.

“Anything is fine. I’m even willing to be a handyman.” Tan Liu sighed with emotion.

“Rumor has it that their handymen get a few pills every month, and they can simply take whatever herb juice they want,” Tan Liu said with a face full of yearning.

Qin Yu chuckled and said, “So it’s just for this small matter. Isn’t this simple? I’ll help you talk to Si Shiyue later. I’ll ask him to keep you by his side.”

Tan Liu was stunned for a moment and then hurriedly said, “Brother Tie, is what you said true?”

“It’s true. You and I are fated to meet. It’s just a matter of a sentence,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

“But you must understand that even if Si Shiyue gives me face, you must also concern about other people’s feelings. So when you first join the Si family, you might have to start from the beginning.” Qin Yu quickly changed the topic to avoid suspicion from Tan Liu.

“Brother Tie, I’ll never forget your great kindness!” Tan Liu quickly picked up his wine cup and said.

“You’re welcome,” Qin Yu laughed as he picked up the wine cup and finished drinking it with Tan Liu.

That night, the two of them drank until they were dead drunk.

Originally, Qin Yu had wanted to snatch the invitation letter directly. However, he was at the foot of Mount Taihua and was unfamiliar with the place. He was also afraid that something would go wrong.

Therefore, Qin Yu gave up on the idea.

The following day. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

While Qin Yu and Tan Liu were eating, he casually mentioned, “Brother Tan, your invitation letter must be costly, isn’t it?”

“To get this invitation, I had to beg and spend a large amount of money and time,” Tan Liu smiled bitterly and said.

“Tsk! Tsk! You actually wasted so much money on such a piece of miserable paper. What nonsense!” Qin Yu pretended to sigh and said.

“Brother Tie, you don’t understand the pain people like us went through,” Tan Liu sighed with emotion and said.

Seeing the opportunity, Qin Yu tentatively said, “With me around, you don’t need an invitation at all. Why don’t you take this opportunity to sell the invitation letter and earn back the money?”

“Forget it, in case something unexpected happens,” Tan Liu furrowed his brows and said.

“Something unexpected? Hehe! It seems that Brother Tan doesn’t believe me,” Qin Yu clapped his hands, stood up, and was about to leave.

Tan Liu hurriedly pulled Qin Yu back. He gritted his teeth and said, “I’ll listen to you and sell this invitation!”

“It has nothing to do with me whether you sell it or not. I just feel a little heartache over such a large sum of money. This invitation must have cost tens of millions of spirit coins!” Qin Yu tried to probe information out of him.

“I don’t know the exact amount, but I estimate it can be sold for 100 million spirit coins. This thing can be both valuable and worthless,” said Tan Liu in a deep voice.

“Sell it,” Qin Yu nodded slightly and said. “It’ll be a piece of waste paper after two days.”

“Alright. I won’t waste any more time. I’ll go now,” Tan Liu said.

After that, Tan Liu stood up and walked out of the inn.

The moment he stepped out of the door, Qin Yu immediately activated his desolate divine eye and followed him closely.

Qin Yu then took a black robe from his Spatial Magic Artifact to cover his face and quickly followed him.

Tan Liu took out the invitation letter. Just as he was about to speak, Qin Yu took the lead to step forward and block him.

“Invitation letter? You actually have an invitation to Mount Taihua?” Qin Yu suppressed his voice to avoid being recognized by Tan Liu.

Tan Liu nodded and said, “That’s right. I don’t need this invitation letter for now. That’s why I’m planning to sell it.”

“How much does it cost?” Qin Yu asked despite knowing the answer.

“100 million spirit coins,” Tan Liu said after some thought.

Qin Yu had been feeling guilty, to begin with. Thus he immediately said, “I’ll pay you 200 million spirit coins. Sell this to me.”

“Really?” Tan Liu was startled and hurriedly asked.

“Yes, absolutely,” Qin Yu said.

Therefore, Qin Yu took out his card and handed it to Tan Liu.

With a burst of bright light, 200 million spirit coins were transferred to Tan Liu’s card.

“Alright. This invitation letter is now mine,” Qin Yu couldn’t wait to take over the invitation letter.
