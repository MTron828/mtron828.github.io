Chapter 1634: Chapter 1,634, the sect master made his move! 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Barrow subconsciously took two steps back, his face revealing a grave expression.

Because this person was none other than the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s sect master!

He never expected that he would actually meet the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s sect master in such a small town!

“What’s Wrong?”Not far away, the god King said with a cold face.

Baro gritted his teeth and did not say a word, as if he was struggling with his thoughts.

The godly king walked quickly to Baro. Just as he was about to speak, he saw the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect not far away.

“It’s... It’s him!”The Godly King subconsciously took two steps back, and beads of sweat appeared on his forehead!

He recalled the conversation between the Master of the northern land and the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect not long ago. Wasn’t the scene shown in that picture the same as this area? !

“Hurry... Hurry up and leave!”The Godly King seemed to be scared out of his wits and turned around to leave.

However, at this moment, Baro took a long breath.

He glanced at the godly king and said coldly, “I’m not leaving.”

“Are you crazy? !”The Godly King was stunned.

Baro said coldly, “All along, these two brothers of the Xiao family have been standing on top of us, be it a legend or the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect.”

“They are like a huge mountain, pressing down on our heads! Everyone says that their strength is above ours. I’ve had enough.”

Seeing this scene, the godly king’s expression became even uglier.

This Baro was probably crazy!

“What do you want to Do? I order you to go back immediately!”The Godly King said with a black face.

Baro said coldly, “Today, I’m going to climb over this huge mountain. I don’t have the chance to find Xiao Hai. Then let’s use this Xiao Sheng as an example!”

With that said, he ignored the godly monarch’s obstruction and strode in the direction of the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s sect master!

The godly monarch and the others stood not far away, their expressions extremely flustered.

However, he was not in a hurry to leave. Instead, he planned to see just how strong the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s sect master’s true body was! Was it like the rumors!

“As long as I don’t make a move, it should be fine,”the godly monarch thought to himself.

Anyway, the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect had said that he disdained to make a move against the Northern Land’s master when he was young, so what about himself?

Thinking of this, the godly monarch narrowed his eyes and looked in the direction of Baro.

Baro walked toward the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect step by step. Soon, he arrived in front of Saint Xiao.

Their eyes met. Baro seemed to have mustered up his courage, and his entire face was slightly red and swollen.

However, Saint Xiao’s condition was very different. His expression was calm as he looked down at Baro. His gaze was filled with indifference.

“Saint Xiao, everyone says that your ability is the best in the world, ranked number one in the southern region,”Baro said coldly.

Saint Xiao opened his mouth and shook his head. “I never said that I was number one, and I can’t guarantee that I’m number one.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Hahahahahaha!”Hearing this, Barrow couldn’t help but burst into laughter!

“I knew that you, Xiao Sheng, only have a false reputation!”

Xiao Sheng sighed slightly and said, “In the past, I didn’t dare to guarantee that I was number one, but now, I am indeed the number one person in the southern region.”

Barrow was startled. He said with a cold face, “What do you mean?”

“Speaking of which, I don’t need to explain these things to you because you are not qualified,”Xiao Sheng said faintly.

“But today, I can satisfy you, satisfy the curiosity of a person who is about to die.”

Speaking up to this point, Xiao Sheng put his hands behind his back and said with a sigh, “Indeed, I don’t dare to guarantee that my strength is above Xiao Hai’s, but I am definitely not inferior to him.”

“He doesn’t like a false reputation, and neither do I. But I don’t know who is stronger between me and him.”

“As for the so-called three madmen and three unique skills of yours, I’ve never taken them seriously.”

Baro’s expression suddenly changed, and he said angrily, “Xiao Sheng, what big words you have! I’ve never fought with Xiao Hai before, so how do you know that I’m inferior to him!”

Xiao Sheng’s long and narrow eyes sized up Baro, and then he said with slight ridicule, “You? I’m afraid you don’t even have the qualifications to compete.”

Xiao Sheng’s words completely infuriated baro. He raised his head and roared, “In that case, let’s fight. Do You Dare!”

With that, Baro waved his hand and took out a broadsword!

This broadsword was made by the weapon refining city, and it was indestructible!

In addition to Baro’s powerful strength, its power was astonishing!

Xiao Sheng glanced at the overbearing baro, and picked up the hoe from the side.

“Come on,”Xiao Sheng said expressionlessly.

Baro could not help but laugh loudly, “You plan to use this hoe to fight with me? hahahahaha! Can a hoe kill people?”

“It’s enough to kill you,”Xiao Sheng said.

Baro became more and more angry. He grabbed the broadsword with both hands and said coldly, “No one has ever dared to look down on me like this! I have already killed the three lunatics and three uniques. Next is you!”

After saying that, his feet suddenly shook as he grabbed the broadsword in his hand. The spiritual power in his entire body merged with the Broadsword!

After that, Baro suddenly exerted force with his palm, and the broadsword immediately slashed downwards!

The surrounding space was split into two at this moment, and a terrifying power swept out in all directions!

Faced with this powerful attack, Xiao Sheng’s expression was still calm.

He grabbed the hoe with one hand, and then gently waved it forward to meet the broadsword.

At the moment of contact, the light swept out in all directions!

At this moment, it was as if everything had come to a standstill!

Half a second later, a terrifying explosion exploded!

The broadsword in Baro’s hand was suddenly blasted away! A powerful force instantly shattered Baro’s wrist!

“Ah!”

The pain caused Barrow to let out a heart-wrenching cry!

But before Barrow could react, the HOE had already closed in on him!

Barrow’s expression changed drastically! He hurriedly used all the spells in his body in an attempt to withstand this attack!

However, all the light in front of the hoe was as crisp as paper. The moment it touched, it was directly torn apart!

Baro’s expression changed drastically! His pupils dilated as he stared at the sickle-like hoe!

“Bang!”

A crisp sound exploded on Baro’s head.

In the next second, his head shattered like a watermelon. Even his primordial spirit was shattered by the shock and disappeared into this world.

Baro’s sturdy body fell to the ground and never got up again.

“Who said a hoe can’t kill people?”Xiao Sheng said coldly.

The godly monarch’s expression was extremely ugly! He only felt a wave of lingering fear!

Fortunately, he wasn’t the one who attacked just now. Otherwise, the result wouldn’t have been much better!

“Quickly retreat!”The godly monarch made a prompt decision and turned around to leave.

However, just as he turned around, Xiao Sheng had already quietly arrived in front of him and blocked his way.

“Did I let you go?”Xiao Sheng’s narrow eyes did not have the slightest emotion, but it was enough to make one shudder in fear!

“You... you...”

The Godly King opened his mouth, but he could not say a word.
