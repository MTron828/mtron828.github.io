Chapter 852: Chapter 852, the Golden Core was damaged

Su Qian’s delicate body was immediately sent flying.

She opened her mouth to speak, but blood kept gushing out of her mouth like a fountain.

Uncle Guan snorted coldly and then strode into the room.

In the room.

Qin Yu was sitting cross-legged on the bed.

His Dantian was shining, and the violent power was rushing to every part of his body.

Qin Yu’s body was rapidly improving, and his bones and blood seemed to be reshaping again and again.

Seeing this scene, uncle Guan couldn’t help but sneer, “The critical moment of the breakthrough... Fortunately, we didn’t come too late.”

“It seems that this kid is about to step into the perfect realm,”the young man beside Uncle Guan also said in a low voice.

Uncle Guan nodded slightly and said coldly, “Don’t waste time. Kill him as soon as possible to avoid any accidents.”

After saying that, uncle Guan’s hand flashed with light, and a terrifying qi force rapidly gathered in his palm.

“Brat, go to hell!”

Accompanied by Uncle Guan’s furious roar, the terrifying energy in his hand directly smashed towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu, who was at the crucial moment of breaking through, did not have the mood to deal with it. He could only forcefully withstand it!

“Boom!”

Qin Yu’s entire body was directly sent flying! He spat out a mouthful of blood!

But even so, Qin Yu still didn’t open his eyes.

He relied on his powerful divine sense to stabilize his mind.

His body was still emitting light everywhere.

“Eh?”Uncle Guan couldn’t help but frown. A trace of surprise flashed across his face.

He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said in a low voice, “Facing such a blow, he can still stabilize his mind. This kid isn’t simple.”

“Uncle Guan, hurry up and kill him.”The youth at the side urged.

Uncle Guan did not say anything more. He slowly closed his hands, as if he was brewing some terrifying spell.

Cold energy gathered between his hands, and the entire house collapsed!

“I want to see how you will break through in front of me!”Uncle Guan shouted, and then his hands suddenly pushed forward!

“Rumble...”

The terrifying moon was like a round wheel, rolling toward Qin Yu!

That Ball of power exploded on Qin Yu’s body! The entire house was completely turned into dust, and even the entire mystic realm was buzzing, as if it could not withstand this power!

Waves of smoke and dust were stirred up around Qin Yu, blocking everyone’s vision.

Uncle Guan did not have time to think. He stepped forward and walked all the way to Qin Yu’s side.

However, something that shocked uncle Guan happened.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s body was covered in blood. His bones were shattered, and half of his body was almost dyed red with blood.

Even so, Qin Yu was still as steady as a rock and immovable as a mountain!

His internal Qi was still rising steadily.

“How could this be!”This immediately shocked Uncle Guan!

Putting aside Qin Yu’s tough and fierce body, just his powerful state of mind was enough to shake the world!

“No Wonder Hong Yimen failed repeatedly,”said the young man at the side in a low voice.

“This kid’s degree of terror is beyond our imagination.”

Uncle Guan’s face was extremely gloomy. He narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “You’re really a talent. It’s really a pity to kill you just like that...”

At this time, Qin Yu had not yet successfully stepped into the great circle, but he could still withstand two moves from him unconsciously!

If he succeeded in breaking through, how great would it be? !

Thinking of this, uncle Guan’s finger condensed a light that was like a sharp thorn.

“In that case, I will shatter your golden core!”Uncle Guan said with a vicious face.

The light on his finger that was like a sharp thorn shone brightly, emitting a chilling light.

Then, uncle Guan’s finger suddenly stretched forward, and the light instantly rushed towards Qin Yu’s lower abdomen!

Such a vicious move immediately caused Qin Yu’s golden core to receive a violent impact! And Qin Yu’s body also shook unconsciously!

His forehead was covered in secret sweat. It was unknown whether it was because of pain or because of nervousness!

“Hahahaha!”Seeing this, uncle Guan could not help but burst into laughter.

“As long as I destroy your golden core, even if you have great ability, you will still be reduced to a waste!”

Uncle Guan used the same trick again, and once again struck towards Qin Yu’s lower abdomen!

Qin Yu’s Jindan once again suffered a violent impact!

The light floating on the Jindan seemed to have dimmed a bit at this moment!

All cultivation was supported by the Jindan.

Once the Jindan was destroyed, then it would be completely reduced to a trash!

Sweat kept oozing out from Qin Yu’s forehead. The pain made Qin Yu’s physical body have a physiological reaction.

The light in Uncle Guan’s palm grew stronger. He narrowed his eyes and said, “One more time, break your Golden Core!”

This time, he had almost gathered all of Uncle Guan’s strength! As long as it fell, the golden core would be destroyed!

“Break for me!”

Uncle Guan roared angrily, and the light in his hand stabbed straight at Qin Yu’s lower abdomen!

At this critical moment, Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes!

His body leaned to the side, and the light pierced into Qin Yu’s Dantian and brushed past the Golden Core!

Qin Yu’s lower abdomen was pierced through, and blood flowed out, but fortunately, it deviated from the position of the Golden Core. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Qin Yu stood up from the ground. He touched his dantian, and his face couldn’t help but be a little cold.

Uncle Guan’s eyes also narrowed slightly, and he sneered, “You’re really lucky, to actually complete the breakthrough at this moment...”

“But unfortunately, your jindan has been damaged. Even if you made a breakthrough, what can you do?”
