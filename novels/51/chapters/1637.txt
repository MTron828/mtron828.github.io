Chapter 1638: Chapter 1,638: body tempering begins 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu remained silent, but his heart was already moved.

It was currently the time of the Great War with the northern lands, and the Supreme Treasures of the central plains were indeed of great use.

If he could obtain a saint weapon, it would be enough to change the outcome of the battle.

It was not an exaggeration to say that even the master of the northern lands would not be able to withstand a fully resurrected saint weapon.

Furthermore, Qin Yu indeed needed master Zheng Yang’s help to refine the artifact.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu let go of him.

“I’ll leave your dog life for now,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“But I’m warning you, you better not lie to me.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Master Zheng Yang hurriedly nodded and said, “Definitely, definitely!”

This master Zheng Yang had an illustrious family background and an extremely high status in the local area. To him, it was not worth risking his life just to pick up a girl.

Therefore, he did not continue to pester him. He brought Qin Yu home.

Xiao Cao was sleeping soundly in Qin Yu’s arms. After taking the pill, the effects of the aphrodisiac pill had already dissipated.

Qin Yu brought Xiao Cao to the room and settled her down. Then, he came before Master Zhengyang.

“If you still want that thing, you’d better not have any more ideas about Xiao Cao,”Qin Yu glanced at Master Zhengyang’s crotch and said coldly.

Master Zhengyang nodded repeatedly and said, “I understand, I understand. You have a good rest tonight. Tomorrow...”

“Right now. I don’t have so much time,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Seeing this, master Zhengyang could only agree.

He turned his head and led Qin Yu to a secret chamber.

This secret chamber was made by him personally, and it was indestructible.

The moment the door opened, one could see that there were many divine weapons displayed inside.

And placed in the middle was a jade-green flute.

This flute looked very extraordinary. There were many talismans engraved on it, as if it was hiding some huge power.

Master Zhengyang brought Qin Yu to the front of the flute and carefully took it down.

“This item is called wuxiao. It is a treasure obtained from the central plains. However, I do not know how to use it.”Master Zhengyang said.

Qin Yu took the Xiao and rubbed it in his hand.

The texture of the Xiao was rough. It felt like he was holding hands.

However, this Xiao was extremely sturdy. Even if Qin Yu used all his strength, he could not break it.

“If you don’t know how to use this Xiao, then why did you keep it?”Qin Yu asked with a cold face.

This old Deng was extremely cunning. He would never take anything useless.

Master Zheng Yang said with slight embarrassment, “The other party said that in order to activate this Xiao, what kind of spell would be needed. But what is this spell? I have to find it myself. I really don’t know.”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “You really don’t Know?”

“I swear, I really don’t know!”Master Zheng Yang said hurriedly.

“If I knew, I would have brought it with me at all times. There’s no need to refine any divine weapons.”

Qin Yu saw that he didn’t seem to be lying, so he temporarily kept this Xiao.

The characters carved on Xiao were extremely mysterious, like the characters of a certain tribe.

However, with Qin Yu’s knowledge, he could only guess. See so for myself.

“I’ll ask man with the mustache later,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

After putting Xiao away, Qin Yu looked at master Zheng Yang.

“If I don’t kill you, does that count as saving your life?”Qin Yu suddenly asked.

Master Zheng Yang was stunned and said with some confusion, “Count... Count?”

“Alright, then I’ll Be Your Savior.”Qin Yu nodded slightly.

“I’ll Be Your Savior the most. Shouldn’t you repay me?”

Master Zhengyang had already faintly sensed that something was amiss. However, the right to speak was in Qin Yu’s hands after all, so he could only bite the bullet and agree.

Following that, he saw Qin Yu waving his hand and keeping all of the divine weapons into his bag.

“Take this as your repayment to me,”said Qin Yu.

Master Zhengyang’s expression changed drastically. He hurriedly said, “This won’t do. I spent a lot of effort to build these divine weapons. This is my life!”

“This is your life? What’s under it?”Qin Yu pointed at Master Zhengyang’s crotch.

Master Zheng Yang subconsciously covered his crotch. He said with some pain, “Qin Yu, you can choose a few items from here, but take all of them away... This is really taking my life!”

Qin Yu patted master Zheng Yang’s shoulder and said, “I’m Your Savior. It’s nothing for Your Savior to take something from you.”

“Moreover, I could have snatched it, but now I’m still discussing it with you, right?”Qin Yu said with a crafty smile.

Master Zhengyang had difficulty speaking. Qin Yu’s greed had far exceeded his imagination.

“A great war is about to break out between the southern and northern regions. These divine weapons of yours can be put to good use.”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“Don’t worry. If there is a chance, I will return these divine weapons.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and walked out.

Although Master Zhengyang was unhappy, he had no idea what to do at this moment.

“There’s a knife on the word ‘pervert’. For a woman, you threw away my armory!”Master Zhengyang couldn’t help but slap himself twice.

...

In the refining room.

An extremely huge furnace was placed here.

It was unknown what material the furnace was made of, but it was emitting a dark red color.

Compared to Xiao Cao’s father’s refining equipment, this furnace was much more advanced.

Qin Yu sat cross-legged in it. His body emitted a faint golden light as he waited for his body to be tempered.

Master Zhengyang walked to Qin Yu. He took out the purple-red Heaven Flame and said in a deep voice, “Are you really going to use your body as a weapon to be tempered?”

“Yes.”Qin Yu nodded.

He glanced at master zhengyang and berated, “Don’t use the purple-red heaven flame. Use the fire in the pond!”

Master Zhengyang came back to his senses. He hurriedly changed the flame to the purple-red heaven flame in the pond and then threw the flame into it.

As the flame entered, Qin Yu’s body began to collapse.

With the intervention of Master Zhengyang’s refining, the temperature of the flame suddenly soared!

These flames seemed to have a life of their own, clinging to every part of Qin Yu’s body, as if they were going to fuse with his body.

It had to be said that although this master Zhengyang was a pervert, his refining method was indeed very brilliant. Compared to the others in the refining city, it was clearly several levels higher.

Master Zhengyang controlled the flames. With the method of forging divine weapons, he slowly refined Qin Yu’s body.

And under this kind of roasting, Qin Yu’s body was constantly destroyed and then slowly reassembled.

At the same time.

The southern region had completely fallen. Under the leadership of Yongji and a few godly monarchs, they occupied the various large cities and sect in the southern region.

They borrowed all the paintings in the northern region to feed on the people in the major cities.
