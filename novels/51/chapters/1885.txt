1886 The Gate of Memory

After saying this, they did not stay any longer and quickly left the place.

This somewhat surprised Qin Yu. He did not expect the people from the nine great aristocratic families would come to him

“Looks like this competition is a pretty good stepping stone,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

However, he knew that once people found out about his relationship with Si Shiyue, they would immediately disappear without a trace.

On the other end.

Everything was as Qin Yu had guessed. The news of Qin Yu’s chaotic body defeating Si Shiyu spread very quickly.

Almost all of the nine great aristocratic families had heard of it. When Yan Ruoxue received the news, she was even more excited.

“Uncle Yan, is everything you said true?” Yan Ruoxue was so excited that she looked like a young girl who had never experienced the world. Her beautiful eyes seemed to have stars in them, and they were full of gentleness that Uncle Yan had never seen.

“However, Si Shiyu suppressed his cultivation realm to the Early-stage of Reversion Void. Otherwise, Qin Yu most likely wouldn’t have won,” Uncle Yan nodded his head and said. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“This is good enough!” Yan Ruoxue said excitedly.

“In the same cultivation realm, Si Shiyu lost to Qin Yu. It means Qin Yu has a chance to defeat Si Shiyue!

Uncle Yan opened his mouth but didn’t say anything. However, he sighed in his heart.

“Young Lady still doesn’t understand. So what if Qin Yu is stronger than Si Shiyue? What can he change…” Uncle Yan muttered and shook his head.

…

At the Si family.

The elder from the Si family who attended the competition returned to the Si family and told Si Shiyue the news.

“I didn’t expect to have another chaotic body in this world. Moreover, it’s so powerful,” the Si family’s elder said.

Si Shiyue glanced at him and said, “He won against Si Shiyu?”

“That’s right. I saw it with my eyes. Even our Si family’s life-and-death diagram couldn’t suppress him,” the elder said.

Si Shiyue frowned slightly and said, “Qin Yu… This name sounds familiar. I feel like I’ve heard it somewhere before.”

The Si family’s elder nodded slightly and said, “That’s right. I also find it familiar… Eh? I remember now.”

At this moment, the Si family’s elder looked at Si Shiyue and said, “The person who crushed the Tong family not long ago seems to be this Qin Yu.”

“Oh, that’s right. It’s him. He led the people of Demon-slaying Peak to exterminate the Tong family. There was such a thing,” Si Shiyue nodded slightly.

“If we accept Qin Yu into our Si family in the future, our Si family will have two chaotic bodies,” the elder said with a smile.

Hearing this, Si Shiyue looked at the elder coldly.

“Why? Do you think he can replace me?” Si Shiyue said coldly.

“Young Master Si, you’ve misunderstood. No one in this world can replace you…” the elder quickly said.

Si Shiyue snorted coldly and said, “So what if he has a chaotic body? If you think I’ve relied on a chaotic body to achieve what I have today, I can only say that you’re too short-sighted.”

After saying this, Si Shiyue turned around and left.

…

Qin Yu rushed back to Demon-slaying Peak.

The Demon-slaying Peak had prepared a celebration banquet and was waiting for Qin Yu’s return.

They had set up a banquet at Demon-slaying Peak with precious delicacies and fine wine on the table. Everyone was happy and enjoying themselves.

Qin Yu didn’t want to ruin their mood, so he followed them to eat and drink all night.

Everyone at the table drank a toast to each other and congratulated Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, I didn’t expect you to do what Jiu Xiao couldn’t.”

“That’s right. I’m afraid the number one of Demon-slaying Peak will have to change his name in the future.”

Qin Yu looked at Jiu Xiao and noticed he did not care about this.

But he still waved his hand and said, “The number one of Demon-slaying Peak will always be Jiu Xiao. I’m just lucky.”

“Qin Yu, you don’t have to be so humble,” everyone laughed and said.

Jiu Xiao also said indifferently, “Qin Yu, you don’t have to be so humble. I’m not such a petty person. However, if you and I were to fight, it’s hard to say who would win.”

“Certainly.” Qin Yu nodded slightly.

After all, there was a big gap between the two. Although Qin Yu had defeated Nangong, it did not mean he could defeat Jiu Xiao.

After the celebration banquet, Qin Yu couldn’t wait to return to his cave abode.

In the cave abode, Chang Mang was still guarding Jue Wu.

Seeing Qin Yu return, he quickly got up and walked over to him, carefully looking at him.

“Not bad, you came back alive,” Chang Mang muttered.

Qin Yu rolled his eyes at Chang Mang and asked immediately, “How’s Jue Wu?”

“She’s still in closed-door seclusion.” Chang Mang pointed with his finger.

Following the direction of Chang Mang’s finger, they saw the purple light within the mountain stream had become even stronger. It looked incredibly mysterious, and it filled more than half of the canyon.

This force was extremely destructive. Even Qin Yu could sense a trace of danger.

“I don’t know if Jue Wu can completely control the power of the purple cloud pearl,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

The power of the purple cloud pearl wasn’t any weaker than that of a Saint Weapon. Once Jue Wu completely controlled the power of the purple cloud pearl, even if she was only at the Reversion Void Stage, her strength would probably be close to the True Saint!

…

...

In the blink of an eye, a month had passed. During this month, Jue Wu still showed no signs of coming out of seclusion.

Qin Yu had no choice but to leave the cave abode with Chang Mang and took on the mission of Demon-slaying Peak.

There were only one and a half years left for his three-year promise. And this one and a half years were extremely short for cultivators. It could be said to pass by in the blink of an eye.

Qin Yu had spent half a year accumulating a large number of points.

His token showed around 600 points.

“600 points are still not enough,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Chu Shiyu’s words kept replaying in his mind.

If he relied too much on his physical strength, he would suffer a setback sooner or later.

Therefore, Qin Yu planned to exchange for a large number of cultivation methods before leaving Thunder Courtyard.

By then, even if he left Thunder Courtyard, he could still study these cultivation methods at any time.

In the blink of an eye, half a year had passed.

...

For the whole year, Qin Yu had been working very hard, not to miss any mission. No matter big or small, he would take part in it.

Many times, Qin Yu would accept two or more missions at the same time. After completing one mission, he would immediately head to the next mission location.

At this time, Qin Yu’s points had reached 1,300 points or so.

“It’s almost time,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Exchanging cultivation techniques also required time.

Therefore, Qin Yu planned to go to Thunder Academy in the first main peak with Chang Mang to exchange for techniques.

On this day, the two headed to the first main peak together.

At this moment, a golden light flashed across Qin Yu’s mind. The primordial spirit in his mind suddenly opened its eyes!

“Eh? What is this?” In his mind, Qin Yu’s primordial spirit looked at the scene in front and could not help but be stunned.
