Chapter 2719: Escape

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Yi Yun’s expression was gloomy and uncertain. He seemed to know some of the secrets.

He didn’t answer Hong Luan’s question and turned to look at the eight people who set up the formation.

“How are you all, eight law-enforcement officers? Are you alright?”

Even though the eight of them only had Dao Realm level 5 power, it seemed like the power of the eight trigrams protected them when they joined the formation.

They were not as miserable as the three of them.

The leader shook his head with a heavy expression.

“We can’t use this move anymore. We realize that the rehearsal is slowly becoming a reality. Every time we use this Great Expansion Divine Technique, the power of this Eight Trigrams Formation Disk will be consumed. This time, the internal qi of that great ominous being is even stronger than the last time.”

Yi Yun’s expression turned grave when he heard that.

“If the prophecy comes true, what will happen?”

Hong Luan asked in fear.

“The compass will loosen its restraints due to insufficient power. The living creatures inside will escape and then the world will be destroyed.”

The law-enforcement officer said softly.

“The world will be destroyed!”

Hong Luan gasped.

Judging from the internal qi emitted by that living being just now, this prophecy was not a coincidence.

“We’ll talk about it when the lord arrives,” said Yi Yun softly.

This was the greatest secret that the guild was protecting.

However, the source of this power was something that many of the Holy Consciousness who had lived for a long time in the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom knew.

The origin of the formation that summoned the compass was once obtained from an ancient tomb.

In the 104th year of the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom, the two gods of the Divine Realm above the Saint Kingdom had a divine battle.

The entire Saint Kingdom was affected. At that time, almost all the power was absorbed by the Divine Realm.

This was the first time this tomb revealed its appearance. Even the Holy Lord had not discovered it before.

The appearance of the tomb had attracted almost all the top-notch martial artists of the Saint Kingdom. Even the Holy Lord had appeared.

However, the Holy Master suddenly left after the tomb array was broken.

They originally thought it was a tomb of great danger, so even the three Holy Consciousness and many Dao Realm experts didn’t dare to enter.

In the end, a few cultivators who were not afraid of death entered the tomb and successfully obtained the ancient book in it.

The name of that ancient book was called “The Book of Slaying Gods”.

It recorded in detail how to activate the true power of the Eight Trigrams

Formation. This power was not something that a single person could activate.

Even a Holy Lord couldn’t do it. However, the genius author had split the power into eight. They could work together to activate the power of the eight trigrams hidden in the world.

This was why there were Guardian of Order’s Law Enforcers. Moreover, this book also recorded the consequences of using it, which was the destruction of the world!

“Go and search carefully to see if any items are left behind. Forget it, I’ll go personally! ”

Lord Tang suddenly remembered something. He moved to the place where the Eight Trigrams Formation disappeared and then he carefully investigated it.

Hong Luan and Yi Yun followed closely behind. They had not forgotten about their mission.

That was the item that held the coordinates of the Nineteenth Prison.

However, they found nothing left after a careful inspection.

Their expressions became extremely ugly. After an ordinary cultivator died, one would leave their space rings, magical artifacts, and other things behind.

Even if one was completely shattered, the others could still find traces of broken bones.

However, they did not discover any trace of Qin Yu’s internal qi.

“To be able to escape from such a terrifying Eight Trigrams Formation, this child is indeed the person behind this!”

Lord Tang’s expression turned cold.

To be able to escape from such terrifying power, there was no other possibility other than the legendary Dao of Dream.

In addition, Qin Yu was only Dao Realm level 5.

“Seal this place completely! The rest of you continue to interrogate!”

Lord Tang coldly gave the order and then turned to leave.

The other two also frowned slightly. If it was the Dao of Dream, then it was not something they could deal with.

After hesitating for a moment, the two of them left separately.

The arrangements for this matter had already exceeded their authority. They had to wait for someone of a higher level to arrive before they could give further orders.

At this moment, Qin Yu woke up in the passageway.

He was lying on the ground. The Saint Power in his body was almost dry.

Even the Night Qi could not completely offset this injury. Qin Yu gritted his teeth and struggled to stand up.

His body felt like it was being cut by a knife every step he took.

The bones in his feet also made cracking sounds as if they were about to break at any moment.

Every step he took now was like a trial of life and death.

In this passage, every moment he spent consumed a lot of energy.

If he did not leave in time, he would probably lost here.

However, he would probably be discovered by the people of the three major forces if he were to leave now.

“Farther away! Farther away!”

Just as Qin Yu was about to faint, his body became hazy and he returned to the real world.

“Where is this place?”

A sharp scream suddenly sounded in Qin Yu’s ear. He only saw a pink color appear in front of his eyes before he fainted.

“I seem to be flying.”

This was Qin Yu’s last thought.

He was sent flying with a punch, and then his body seeped out a lot of blood!

By the time he woke up, he did not know how much time had passed.

When he opened his eyes, he saw an extremely dark face.

“Why is it you?”

Qin Yu felt a chill on his body and immediately pulled up the blanket.

However, an instant extreme tearing feeling almost made him faint again.

That injury seemed to have even covered his divine sense. He had never been so weak before.

“I should be the one asking! Why are you here?”

Meng Jing let out an angry roar and her body started to tremble.

She immediately grabbed Qin Yu, but she did not expect him to faint again.

She stretched out two fingers to check Qin Yu’s internal qi. “He shouldn’t have seen it, right? He was already so heavily injured.” Meng Jing muttered to herself through gritted teeth in doubt. “No, he seemed to have glanced at me at the last moment!” Meng Jing’s eyes turned misty and her face turned red.

“How did you appear here?”

Meng Jing gritted her teeth.

She was almost naked just now and was eating a chicken drumstick with one hand.

She was also holding a cat in one hand, but she did not expect such a person to appear suddenly. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

One had to know that the power of her divine soul was practically the number one person below the Holy Lord.

She could sense it at the first moment within 100,000 meters.

The place she lived in had many array formations set up. That was why she showed her true color like this.

However, her expression became solemn when she saw the ring on Qin Yu’s

hand..
