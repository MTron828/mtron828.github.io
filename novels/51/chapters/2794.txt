Chapter 2795: A God or a Curse

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Countless Boundless lightning tribulations of different sizes appeared in the space. The black balls were charging wildly.

The Investiture of Gods also returned calm at this moment as if it had given up struggling.

However, all four people revealed a solemn expression.

No one dared to relax their minds facing this incomplete foreign divine artifact.

Boom!

This silence only lasted for a short moment. The incomplete Investiture of Gods let out a sound of the hard paper shaking.

A god-like shadow appeared in the air. Four nearly transparent hands appeared like chains simultaneously.

They descended on the four people.

As the giant hand slowly pulled out, a surge of soul and material energy was slowly extracted from the four of them.

As the spiritual material power was extracted, four names were slowly written on the Investiture of Gods.

Chi!

Fatty Situ and Zi Yan’s faces turned pale.

They instantly received the heavy injury from the Investiture of Gods. Bai Zizai and Ming were slightly better, but their expressions were much uglier than before.

“How dare a damaged ancient item want to steal my soul!”

Bai Zizai laughed loudly.

He stretched out his hand. His arm instantly crossed an unknown amount of space.

He grabbed a corner of the Investiture of Gods.

Meanwhile, a fist landed on the Investiture of Gods like a falling star.

An almost tangible golden peak power flowed out of Ming Alester’s body.

Attack!

Situ Pangpang’s divine kingdom shook, and he grabbed a small corner of the tablet.

The moment this power erupted, it was like a brilliant firework explosion.

Countless space flowers covered an area of 10,000 meters. The space ice flower lock engulfed countless powerful creatures.

The Nine Nether Cliff located outside the void emitted a vibration that resounded throughout the Saint Kingdom. Under this attack, the area within 10,000 meters of the cliff was completely reduced to nothingness. This power wiped them out in the most primitive way.

Almost none of the creatures in the Nine Nether Cliff survived.

When the space flower dissipated, Bai Zizai, Ming, Zi Yan, and Fatty Situ stood where they were.

Terrifying wounds appeared on Bai Zizai and Ming’s bodies, but they each held almost half of the Investiture of Gods.

Zi Yan and Fatty Situ also tore off a small piece.

Under the attacks of the four of them, the incomplete Investiture of Gods was split into four.

They panted wildly but they were ecstatic.

Even Bai Zizai’s expression was filled with uncontrollable excitement. This thing had already exceeded the scope of a magical artifact.

Perhaps he could pry into some kind of Great Dao from the Primordial Chaos stage. At that time, he might be able to break through again.

“Fatty, great job!”

Chang Mang clenched his fists and roared.

Although he could not participate in the battle with his strength, witnessing this battle still made his heart surge.

At this moment, there was a sudden movement.

The hand of the Grim Reaper descended once again. The power to extract souls seemed to be a hundred times stronger than before.

“Oh no! The main body of the Investiture of Gods discovered the intention here!”

Bai Zizai roared.

Their heavily injured bodies were almost impossible to resist the power of the Investiture of Gods again.

A bloody light spurted out and his body suddenly disappeared from the spot.

Ming Alester and Zi Yan also left in an instant.

The hand of the Grim Reaper suddenly grabbed at Little Fatty. His face instantly turned pale.

The power of the divine picture of the Luo River had been completely exhausted during the seizing of the incomplete Investiture of Gods. He could not resist this terrifying power of anger at all.

Die!

The will almost shattered his consciousness.

“Get lost! ”

At this moment, Qin Yu’s power of the night had completely surged through his entire body. He fiercely Imocked away Fatty Situ.

He had saved Fatty Situ at this critical moment and then opened the Heavenly Umbrella to block in front.

“We can’t block it!” Lance shouted crazily.

Boom!

Before he could finish his words, the force instantly shattered the Heavenly Umbrella.

The Path of Heaven’s curtain turned into stars and flew away. The entire umbrella handle shattered into countless pieces of wood that stabbed into Qin

Yu’s body.

Two words appeared in the void.

Qin Yu.

His consciousness began to fade and he vaguely heard roars and cries beside him. Then, he completely fell unconscious.

“Divine Doctor Lu, please save him no matter how difficult it is. You can ask for any Dharma Treasure from the Situ family.”

Heavenly Treasure Continent, Situ Clan.

Fatty Situ roared. His eyes were bloodshot like a mad beast.

“Young Lord Situ, I can’t do anything even if you give me this Investiture of Gods. This is already beyond my ability. The most serious thing about this person is not his injuries, but his soul being absorbed by the Investiture of Gods.”

Divine Doctor Lu’s blade flashed. Qin Yu’s head was instantly split into two.

“You’re f*cking courting death!” Chang Mang’s eyes turned blood-red.

“Stop! Look!”

A silver needle landed on Chang Mang’s arm. His body was locked down instantly. Although he used all his strength, he still could not move.

Divine Doctor Lu stopped Chang Mang and gestured for him to look at Qin Yu’s neck.

At this moment, countless squirming blood vessels were sewing up Qin Yu’s neck.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

In just the time it took for such a dispute, Qin Yu’s body had already recovered to its original state.

“The person who has become a god doesn’t even have the right to die.”

Divine Doctor Lu shook his head.

“Smoker Xie also came to me once. I spent nearly a hundred years using all the methods in my life, but I couldn’t help him escape from the fog. In the end, I watched him become the Creepy of the Nine Nether Cliff. However, I do have some methods that can stabilize the injuries of the woman that he brought along. There’s no charge for this.”

Divine Doctor Lu shook his head and left the room.

The entire space fell into a deathly silence. Could it be that Qin Yu’s ending could only be that of a Creepy at the bottom of a cliff?

“Qin Yu, wake the f*ck up! Do you still want to look for Yan Ruoxue? Are you willing to stop here?”

Chang Mang grabbed Qin Yu’s neck and roared.

“There’s a high chance that he will wake up. Divine Doctor Lu said that he will get further and further away from himself until he leaves his self-consciousness and becomes Creepy.”

After a long time, Lance finally spoke the cruel truth.

“It’s all your fault! If it wasn’t for saving you, Qin Yu wouldn’t be like this!”

Chang Mang’s fist landed on Fatty Situ’s face, causing his face bones to be crooked.

Fatty Situ was smashed onto the ground. Blood seeped out of his face. He just sat on the ground in a daze, thinking about something.

“Calm down! This was Qin Yu’s own choice!”

Aiden slapped Chang Mang hard on his face..
