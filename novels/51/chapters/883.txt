Chapter 884: Chapter 884, prove it to you 

Even the huge Yan family could not find a few half-step martial saints!

“Sending out three martial saints, is it necessary?”Yan Ruoxue subconsciously blocked Qin Yu behind her.

In her opinion, Qin Yu was still the young man who needed protection.

Yan sihai sneered: “Yan Ruoxue, if you really feel sorry for him, then follow me obediently. I will let him live.”

Yan ruoxue gritted her teeth. Just as she was about to speak, Qin Yu gently covered her mouth.

“Three half-step martial saints are not worth mentioning at all.”Qin Yu grinned and said.

“These two years, I have not wasted my time. Otherwise, how could I have brought you to the Yan family so confidently?”

After he finished speaking, Qin Yu blocked Yan ruoxue behind him.

“Do it. Don’t waste my time alone with Ruoxue,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Yan sihai shouted, “Do it! Kill him!”

The three half-step martial saints immediately strode towards Qin Yu!

It was unknown whether it was because of Yan Ruoxue’s side or Qin Yu’s sudden increase in strength, but Qin Yu’s internal Qi was unprecedentedly strong when he faced the three half-step martial saints!

With a furious roar, his fists condensed into a dragon-like shape.

Then, Qin Yu’s fist suddenly smashed out like a cannonball exploding next to his ear!

“Boom!”

That rainbow-like aura suddenly soared, and the destructive power poured out like a waterfall!

Qin Yu Protected Yan Ruoxue with one hand, and used the other hand to face the three half-step martial saints!

In an instant, the three people’s bodies were directly shattered!

The penetrating power of this punch was extremely terrifying. The three people did not retreat too much, but their internal organs had all exploded at this moment!

“Pu!”

They spat out a mouthful of blood, and the blood was mixed with the fragments of their internal organs!

With just one punch, he had killed three half-step martial saints!

Without the appearance of a martial saint, Qin Yu was invincible in this world. This was not a rumor!

Yan Ruoxue’s beautiful eyes were filled with shock! She could not help but cover her mouth gently.

Even though Yan Ruoxue had always trusted Qin Yu, she did not expect that Qin Yu had grown to such a level in such a short period of time!

The veins on Yan Sihai’s forehead bulged. Ever since Yan Jinyao went into seclusion, he had been indifferent to the affairs of the Martial World. He had no idea that Qin Yu had reached such a level!

Among the few people present, only Qin Yu was calm and collected. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He walked to the front of the three people, dug out the golden cores from their bodies, and casually stuffed them into his pocket.

Then, Qin Yu’s gaze fell on Yan Sihai.

“What? Are You So ignorant now?”Qin Yu looked at Yan Sihai coldly.

Yan Sihai’s face was ashen. He snorted coldly and said, “Qin Yu, you really have some ability. I’ve underestimated you.”

“So?”Qin Yu said coldly.

Yan Sihai gritted his teeth and said, “Don’t be arrogant for too long. It’s not like our Yan family can’t afford a martial saint!”

After he finished speaking, Yan Sihai turned around and was about to leave.

“Stop!”

However, at this moment, Qin Yu suddenly let out a stern shout!

That thunderous voice sounded beside Yan Sihai’s ears and for a moment, it shook his legs until they went soft!

“Why? Do you still have something to do?”Yan Sihai said coldly.

Qin Yu took a step forward and walked in front of Yan Sihai.

“Since you’re here, why are you in such a hurry to Leave?”Qin Yu said coldly.

“What do you want?”Yan Sihai said with a tone of iron.

Qin Yu pointed at Yan Ruoxue and said, “As Ruoxue’s uncle, you sent her to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association for personal gain and made her suffer all kinds of torture. Do you want to leave just like that?”

Yan Sihai was both shocked and angry.

As the eldest son of the Yan family, no one had ever dared to talk to him like that!

“Qin Yu, are you crazy? You Dare to talk to me like that?”Yan Sihai was furious.

Qin Yu said coldly, “I’m already polite enough to you now.”

Yan Sihai was so angry that he laughed. “Fine, then what do you want me to do?”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “I promised Ruoxue that everyone who has hurt her will pay a thousand times or a hundred times the price. Everyone who is stained with Ruoxue’s blood will pay with their lives.”

“I can kill you last because you are Ruoxue’s uncle.”

“But now, you must kneel down and apologize to Ruoxue.”

Yan Sihai burst into laughter.

He pointed at Qin Yu’s nose and said, “You want me to kneel down and apologize? I think you are crazy. You know that I... Ah! ! !”

Before Yan Sihai could finish his words, Qin Yu had already kicked Yan Sihai’s knee into pieces!

The intense pain instantly made Yan Sihai kneel on the ground with a plop!

He held his knee, his eyes filled with disbelief.

“You... You Dare to hit me? !”Yan Sihai did not care about the pain, his face was filled with shock.

Qin Yu said coldly, “This is only a small punishment for you. It is too easy for you to kill you just like that.”

Yan Sihai was the patriarch of the Yan family after all. Even under such circumstances, he still didn’t lose his stance.

He pointed at Qin Yu and said, “Good, good! Qin Yu, you have guts. Let’s wait and see, Wait and see!”

After saying that, Yan Sihai glared at Zhang Yin and scolded, “Hurry up and help me downstairs!”

Zhang Yin didn’t dare to say anything. She hurriedly helped Yan Sihai and walked downstairs.

“Oh right, Tell Yan Jinyao that I will personally kill him after he comes out of seclusion.”At this moment, Qin Yu spoke again.

Yan Sihai snorted coldly. He did not say anything and left the place.

After he left, Yan Ruoxue cried out in shock, “You...”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and smiled, “Do you think that I am a little too ruthless? If you don’t like it, I can change.”

“No.”Yan Ruoxue shook her head.

She had been born in a top aristocratic family since she was a child and had long been used to seeing fresh blood.

“I’m just curious about your changes. People do change, but in a short two years, there aren’t many changes.”Yan Ruoxue said in a low voice.

Qin Yu didn’t know what to say for a moment.

If Qin Yu’s changes were 100% , then it was 90% because of Yan Ruoxue.

After that, Qin Yu used the spiritual fire to finish off these corpses.

And because of the fight, cracks also appeared in the room.

On the same day, Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue went to the market and bought wallpaper, flowers, and other various decorations according to their own wishes, as well as a large pile of ingredients.

After returning home, the two of them began to clean up and remodel the huge Yan family manor.

After doing all this, the two of them lay on the bed, panting.

All of this was like an ordinary, happy little couple.

“Alright, I think no one will disturb us now.”Qin Yu looked sideways at Yan Ruoxue who was lying next to him.

When their eyes met, the atmosphere in the room seemed to have become ambiguous.
