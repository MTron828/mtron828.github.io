Chapter 1617: Chapter 1,617, facing Yongji! 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Yongji looked at Kong you and said with a faint smile, “Talk? Who Wants to talk to me? who has the right to talk to me?”

Kong you patted his chest and said, “If Mr. Yongji doesn’t mind, I’m willing to negotiate with you!”

“Hahahahaha!”Yongji immediately burst into laughter.

He suddenly slapped Kong You’s face, and with a “PA”sound, Kong you was sent flying.

“Negotiate? You Think You’re Worthy? Since the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect isn’t here, do I need to negotiate with you losers?”Yongji sneered.

Kong you got up from the ground and covered his face that was almost shattered, looking extremely aggrieved.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer and said with slight sarcasm, “Didn’t you say that Yongji promised you? Why did he slap you now?”

Kong you braced himself and said, “If it wasn’t because you angered Yongji, why would he suddenly change his mind!”

“What a pure retard.”Qin Yu could not help but curse.

At this moment, he could not be bothered to lower himself to this Kong you’s level. The most important thing was still Yongji in front of him.

One after another, black-clothed men appeared around them. They held the painting scrolls in their hands, and streams of black aura lingered around their internal Qi.

“The painting scroll! It’s that painting scroll!”

“As expected, Yongji didn’t plan to talk at all! They had already prepared the painting scrolls!”

“This bastard, we were all fooled by him!”

Yongji couldn’t help but laugh out loud when he saw this, “A bunch of idiots! Today is the Day You Die!”

“What, do you think I don’t exist anymore?”At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly jumped and instantly appeared in front of Yongji.

Yong Ji narrowed his eyes and coldly said, “Qin Yu, I’ve wanted to kill you for a long time. Since you want to die, then I’ll satisfy you!”

After saying that, his internal Qi surged and he suddenly threw a punch towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu angrily shouted and a golden light instantly appeared. His right fist was like a golden dragon as it suddenly smashed over!

“Boom!”

At the instant of the collision, a terrifying airwave swept out in all directions!

This mountain that was like a paradise was instantly reduced to dust, and the aftershock of the shockwave shook countless people until they vomited blood continuously!

Yong Ji’s expression changed slightly. He only felt pain in his fist, and it was as if his bones were about to be shattered!

However, Qin Yu in front of him was brimming with fighting spirit. He did not give Yong Ji the slightest chance to catch his breath, and once again clenched his fist and charged forward!

This time, Yong Ji did not dare to face Qin Yu head-on. Instead, he hurriedly shot into the distance!

“How could this be...”Yong Ji stood high in the sky and could not help but gasp for breath.

During this period of time, his strength had greatly increased. Logically speaking, he should be able to easily crush Qin Yu.

However, after the collision of this fist, he was shocked to discover that Qin Yu’s strength was much stronger than he had imagined!

“Yong Ji, didn’t you come looking for me? Come, let us fight to our heart’s content today!”

Qin Yu took a step forward, and the entire ground instantly collapsed!

The clothes on his body were torn apart by the powerful internal Qi, revealing his dark golden skin! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

This skin was sparkling under the sunlight. At this moment, Qin Yu looked like an undefeatable war god!

Yong Ji looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Don’t think that I’m afraid of You!”

“You talk too much nonsense!”

Qin Yu stepped on the line word formula and walked towards Yong Ji!

Yong Ji knew very well that he could not fight with Qin Yu’s body. His body immediately disappeared into the void. Following that, a beam of light shattered the void. Energy that was like meteorites covered Qin Yu.

This energy was like stones that covered Qin Yu’s body, as if it wanted to freeze Qin Yu.

However, in less than half a second, Qin Yu’s aura directly shattered the energy!

His long hair fluttered under the waves of internal QI, and the resolute expression on his face made people moved.

“Yong Ji, what are you hiding for? Didn’t you want to fight with me? !”Qin Yu’s voice was like thunder, shaking the entire world!

Yong ji shouted, “Qin Yu, do you dare to fight with me in another place? !”

“Change your grandfather!”Qin Yu did not listen to Yong Ji’s nonsense at all. He stepped on the line word formula and charged straight at Yong Ji!

Yong Ji’s hand kneading technique actually struck out hundreds of seals in the blink of an eye!

The sky was covered with ice and snow. This seemed to be a secret technique that had been brought from the northern lands!

This ice and snow contained the power of the Northern Lands’Daoist techniques. The purpose of this technique was to suppress the spiritual power in Qin Yu’s body!

“Good method, but unfortunately, it’s useless against me!”Qin Yu sneered. Under this great ice and snow seal, Qin Yu’s movements were still unrestricted, pressing straight towards Yongji!

“How could it be!”Yongji instantly turned pale with fright. He hurriedly raised both his hands, and that ice and snow transformed into a huge iceberg, pressing towards Qin Yu!

This iceberg was extremely similar to the iceberg of the Northern Lands Lord, and the power contained within it was incomparably terrifying!

Qin Yu raised his head and looked at this ice mountain. He raised his head and laughed loudly, “Dog, trying to suppress me with the Northern Lands’Arts? It’s useless!”

As he spoke, Qin Yu’s body emitted a golden light, and an endless amount of light almost covered the entire world!

After that, Qin Yu’s Golden Fist followed his heart, and with a crushing punch, he faced the Ice Mountain.

“Boom!”

The entire world shook as the void started to collapse. All the laws seemed to be unable to withstand it anymore as they continued to shatter and reassemble.

The iceberg was pierced through at a speed visible to the naked eye and once again turned into an ice and snow seal.

Yong Ji’s expression was ice-cold. It was obvious that Qin Yu’s strength had exceeded his imagination.

“This person is really terrifying,”Yong Ji said coldly.

“In time, he will very likely become the second sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect in the Southern Region!”

Qin Yu, who had shattered the ice mountain, was looking at Yong Ji coldly.

“Why? Are you thinking about your own grave again?”Qin Yu said sarcastically.

Yong Ji narrowed his eyes and said, “Qin Yu, I really want to have a good fight with you. Unfortunately, I want to put the big picture first.”

“Big Picture? What big picture do you have?”Qin Yu sneered.

As he said that, Yong Ji took a step back.

Then, the space in front of him shook.

In the next second, an old man with white hair walked out from the darkness.

This old man was none other than Sima bei!

The moment he appeared, the surrounding space was fluctuating.

This was a display of power. Each and every move of his could cause a huge change in space!

Furthermore, the internal Qi on his body was so powerful that it made people tremble in fear!

“Qin Yu, we meet again.”Sima bei said indifferently.

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed slightly as he said, “Sima Bei? Is this your real body? You actually have such an awesome appearance. No wonder you didn’t dare to show your face.”

Sima bei placed his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Sharp-tongued brat, is it useful to show off your power of speech?”

“It’s indeed useless.”Qin Yu’s internal Qi began to climb.

“Speaking of which, I feel a little surprised that you dare to leave the northern lands.”

Sima bei laughed loudly and said, “You have many unexpected things. I know that it’s impossible for you to join the northern lands, so I don’t want to talk nonsense with you. Today, I’ll let you die here.”
