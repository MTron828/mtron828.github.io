Chapter 944: Chapter 944, the secrets of the spatial artifact 

The moustache man shrunk his neck and muttered, “Alright, stop talking nonsense. I have to run away quickly.”

After saying this, the moustache man turned around and left.

Qin Yu was the first to return to the mystic realm. He told Li Yu the news and asked him to leave temporarily.

After doing all this, Qin Yu considered his next move.

He sat near the secret realm for a long time. After thinking about it, he decided to make a trip to the pavilion of Heavenly Secrets for the time being to find out about the secrets of the spatial divine artifact.

Thus, Qin Yu put on his hat and got up to rush to Jingdu.

All the way to Jingdu, Qin Yu headed straight for the pavilion of Heavenly Secrets.

Everything in the pavilion of heavenly secrets was as usual. Qin Yu directly passed through the hall and rushed to the villa behind the pavilion of Heavenly Secrets.

In the villa, Luo Yang was sitting on the sofa drinking tea. When Qin Yu came in, Luo Yang couldn’t help but shiver in fear.

“Qin... Qin Yu?”Luo Yang swallowed his saliva and asked.

Qin Yu took off his hat and threw it to the side, saying, “Where’s your father?”

Luo Yang said, “My father is in the refining room. I... I’ll go call him right away.”

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude. He poured a cup of tea and waved his hand, saying, “Tell him to come back quickly. I have something to find him for.”

“Okay,”Luo Yang replied and quickly walked out of the living room.

At this moment, Qin Yu didn’t know that danger was approaching.

He sipped his tea slowly and waited quietly for Luo Jingyu.

After Luo Yang walked out of the villa, he hurriedly took out his cell phone and called Gu Xinghe.

Once the call was connected, Luo Yang couldn’t wait to say, “Young Master Gu, Qin Yu is here! He’s in the pavilion of Heavenly Secrets Right Now!”

When Gu Xinghe heard this, he sat up abruptly.

“Are you sure?”Gu Xinghe said coldly.

“Yes! I guarantee he’s at the pavilion of Heavenly Secrets! Come quickly, or he’ll leave soon,”Luo Yang said hurriedly.

Gu Xinghe narrowed his eyes and said, “Think of a way to stall him. I’ll be there right away.”

After saying this, Gu Xinghe looked at long mei and said, “Quick, go and get Zhai Xing for me.”

“Yes, Young Master Gu.”Long Mei did not dare to say anything and quickly walked out.

These few days, Zhai Xing had practically been cooped up in his room drinking. He did not leave the main door and did not step out.

He could not stand the Sky Blood Rainbow and did not like Gu Xinghe’s way of doing things.

However, the naturally loyal Zhai Xing could not disobey Gu Xinghe’s orders at all, so he simply hid in his room. Out of sight, out of mind.

A few minutes later, under the call of long brows, Zhai Xing arrived in front of Gu Xinghe.

“Young master Gu, what’s the matter?”Zhai Xing asked expressionlessly.

Gu Xinghe said coldly, “Follow me to the pavilion of heavenly secrets immediately. Qin Yu is there.”

“Qin Yu?”There was not much emotion on Zhai Xing’s face.

Gu Xinghe glanced at Zhai Xing and said with a cold face, “Uncle Zhai Xing, you seem very reluctant.”

“No,”Zhai Xing said expressionlessly.

“No?”The expression on Gu Xinghe’s face became more and more displeased.

Zhai Xing seemed to be unable to hold it in anymore. He took a deep breath and said, “In my opinion, the one who does evil is his sky blood rainbow, not Qin Yu.”

“Do Evil?”Gu Xinghe could not help but sneer.

“Uncle Zhai Xing, you are already so old, why are you still so childish?”

“What do you mean by evil? What is evil and what is good? Good and evil are just the rules that we people have made up!”

“Whoever I say is evil will be evil!”

Hearing Gu Xinghe’s words, Zhai Xing’s expression became even more unsightly.

“Alright, no more nonsense. Call the people and follow me,”Gu Xinghe said coldly.

Zhai Xing opened his mouth but did not say anything else.

...

Inside the pavilion of heavenly secrets.

Luo Jingyu rushed into the villa.

He knew nothing about Luo Yang, so he did not know that Gu Xinghe was on his way.

After entering the door, Luo Jingyu wiped his sweat and walked quickly towards Qin Yu.

“Mr. Qin, what’s So Urgent?”Luo Jingyu asked.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Pavilion Master Luo, I came to look for you this time because of the space artifact.”

Luo Jingyu’s face turned a little ugly when he mentioned the space God weapon.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and took out another space god weapon. Then, he took out hundreds of spirit stones and handed them to Luo Jingyu.

“These... These are spirit stones? !”Luo Jingyu’s eyes widened when he saw this.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “Spirit stones are top-notch materials for refining weapons. These spirit stones can be regarded as compensation for you.”

Luo Jingyu took the spirit stones and held them in his hands excitedly. He said in a low voice, “It’s really spirit stones...”

At this time, Luo Jingyu seemed to have remembered something. He hurriedly said, “Mr. Qin, the loss of the spirit stones not long ago... was it you who did it?”

“Yes.”Qin Yu didn’t hide anything.

“This is all I can give you now. I hope you can tell me the truth about the spatial divine artifact,”said Qin Yu.

Luo Jingyu sat opposite Qin Yu. He was silent for a moment and then said, “Okay, I promise you.”

Qin Yu said, “My spiritual sense entered the spatial artifact and found a trace of light inside.”

“To tell you the truth, the Spirit Stone in my hand was also inexplicably swallowed by that trace of light.”

“You’ve been inside?”Luo Jingyu was even more surprised when he heard that.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “Normally, that thread of light should be the spiritual sense.”

Luo Jingyu pondered for a moment and said, “That’s right. What’s hidden inside is indeed the spiritual sense.”

“In fact, it’s not some spatial divine artifact, but a prison. What’s locked inside is that thread of spiritual sense.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said in surprise, “Prison?”

“Yes.”Luo Jingyu nodded.

“That strand of divine sense is unrivaled, and this spatial divine artifact is the place where he’s locked up.”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “Then how should this strand of divine sense be released?”

Luo Jingyu smiled bitterly and said, “You shouldn’t ask me that. It might be better for you to ask him yourself.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“But I have to remind you that since it’s a locked divine sense, it’s definitely not a kind person. No one knows what will happen after it’s released.”

Qin Yu seemed to have understood.

This strand of spiritual sense might be like the sky blood rainbow, being imprisoned in that spatial divine artifact.

“Where did you get this thing?”Qin Yu asked.

Luo Jingyu said, “I got it by chance and exchanged it with a magic artifact.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “So you don’t know its origin?”

“Yes.”Luo Jingyu nodded and said.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “I understand. Thank you.”

After saying this, Qin Yu got up and prepared to leave.

“Mr. Qin, you... are you leaving already?”At this time, Luo Yang hurriedly ran in.
