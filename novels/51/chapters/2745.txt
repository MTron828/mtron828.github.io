Chapter 2746: Three-Star Mars

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Although he had mastered the way to con trol the Hell Nightmare in the subconscious, what if it was those people with bright nebulas?

Or perhaps, once he entered a person with a very firm will, he might have to live with the person for the rest of his life. That would be a little terrifying.

He suddenly thought of the scholar who had sealed himself in the cycle of reincarnation.

He chose to reincarnate thousands of times to forget the memory that had seeped into his bones.

Scholar Jun Yixian, what kind of unforgettable memory was that?

This time, Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the ground.

He went straight to Cang Yunzi’s house at the agreed time of three days.

What a strange phenomenon!

Qin Yu raised his head and looked at the sky.

Three dazzling red planets were moving in a triangular orbit.

It was summer in the Saint Kingdom, and the temperature was already above

30 degrees.

However, Qin Yu felt a freezing killing intent.

“Mars guarding the heart. This is the most ominous celestial phenomenon. One Mars is already a huge natural disaster. It’s the first time I’ve seen three Mars appear at the same time. Mars is an ominous star from the Divine Realm. Once it appears, it will be accompanied by a huge ominous omen.”

Cang Yunzi walked out of the courtyard. A group of people had already arrived.

“Does this have anything to do with Heavenly Sin?”

Qin Yu asked.

‘Maybe there is, maybe there isn’t. Everything is set in stone.”

Cang Yunzi shook his head as he looked at Qin Yu.

“I haven’t seen you for three days, but your divine soul has become stronger. It looks like we’ll have a better chance of entering the Tomb of Heavenly Sins this time.”

Cang Yunzi looked at Qin Yu and a strange look flashed in his eyes.

The improvement of the power of the soul required a long and boring cultivation. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He was also surprised that Qin Yu could improve so much in such a short time.

“If you can walk out of the Tomb of Heavenly Sins, your future achievements will be limitless.”

Cang Yunzi sighed.

“Let’s talk about it when we can come out. When has this world ever lacked geniuses?”

Luo Yu teased.

Qin Yu’s current strength should be the weakest among them.

He hadn’t awakened the power of the peak. Although he had some outstanding abilities in cultivating the Dao of Dreams, Luo Yu still didn’t put him in his eyes.

“Didn’t you wipe your mouth after you pooped? Why is your mouth so smelly?” Qin Yu glanced at him.

He didn’t have a good relationship with this person anywvay, so there was no need to show him any mercy.

“I hope that when you go to Heavenly Sin, your mouth will be as tough as it is now. ”

Luo Yu smiled coldly.

Cang Yunzi waved his sleeves and they were instantly swept into a space.

In the blink of an eye, they had already appeared outside Lingxu City.

The dense number of heads and internal qi made Qin Yu shock.

“The appearance of Heavenly Sin is an opportunity for everyone. This place has attracted numerous experts. Even if they were to pick up the items left behind by their deaths, it would be enough for those with lower cultivation levels to make a comeback. Of course, most of them are experts who want to enter the tomb. The secrets that cannot be seen are the most fascinating, right?” Cang Yunzi said with a smile.

Qin Yu looked around. At this moment, there were countless Dao Realm level 9 people.

There were even many people whom Qin Yu could not see through. This made him feel extremely shocked.

“Heavenly Sin didn’t just attract the attention of the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom. The Saint World and even some experts from other Saint Kingdoms have already entered. There are so many of them that no one dares to provoke them even though they might be suppressed by the Dao Mystial Saint

Kingdom.”

After entering the land of myriad tombs, Qin Yu realized how many people there were this time.

The competition between the various large factions was also very intense.

Even Qin Yu’s team, which had heaven-defying strength, could only protect a corner of the north. The rest of the place was almost occupied.

At this moment, boundless blood qi filled the entire land of myriad tombs.

As they fought to enter the region, countless fierce battles had already erupted.

The thick stench of corpses was nauseating.

However, no one was paying attention to this at the moment.

“This is a rare opportunity. Even though they know it’s extremely dangerous, countless cultivators still come and believe that they’re one of the lucky ones. However, the world is so big, and every genius has their methods. Who knows who will eventually obtain the Dharma Treasure in Heavenly Sin?” Cang Yunzi shook his head.

All of a sudden, a visible air vibration was transmitted to Qin Yu’s side. It seemed that an intense battle had taken place in the east.

Someone quickly sent the news. After hearing it, Cang Yunzi told everyone.

“The people at the east gate have also joined forces. Two people who look the same seem to be outsiders who also brought Dao Xuan runes into the Saint Kingdom. However, these two are terrifyingly powerful. A person who just awakened the power of a peak level 12 died with a single attack from them.” Gu Ying frowned slightly and told everyone the information.

He had also understood these two people before. They were from the last batch of outsiders who brought Dao Xuan runes into the Saint Kingdom.

After that, the two of them improved at an extremely terrifying speed. Even the Guardian of Order wanted to pull them under the guild’s command, but they rejected. He did not expect to hear about them again here.

“Xiao Sheng, Brother Xiao Hai, we finally meet again…”

Two persons who looked the same and were extremely powerful. Qin Yu did not need to think to know who they were.

Qin Yu’s mood fluctuated slightly. He could finally see someone familiar after coming here, especially Xiao Hai who had saved him in the ghost realm. If it wasn’t for the fact that the Tomb of Heavenly Sins was about to open, Qin Yu wanted to go over and reminisce with them.

At this moment, the distance between the three Mars in the sky was getting smaller and smaller.

The pitch-black sky of the Saint Kingdom turned blood-red and a blood-like curtain appeared above everyone.

A feeling of killing rushed into Qin Yu’s mind. The three-star Mars could affect his mind.

At this moment, the sound of killing could be heard from the outside.

“Is there someone who wants to attack our position?”

Luo Yu revealed a mocking expression.

They were the strongest force from the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom, yet someone treated them as a target to attack. This made him feel a little uneasy.

“Don’t underestimate it. The three stars and Mars are about to merge. The power of the calamity star has been transmitted to the Saint Kingdom. Even I have been affected to a certain extent. Those with mental cultivation or those who have entered the path of killing will probably go even crazier. We must prevent them from charging in and affecting the formation master’s ability to break the array.”

Cang Yunzi frowned.

He sensed that the people who were fighting madly at the moment were not

difficult to deal with..
