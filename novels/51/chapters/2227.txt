2228 The Seventh Level of Purgatory

What surprised Qin Yu was the spiritual energy in this place was abundant. There were multiple layers of high mountains and gently flowing water. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

He split up a few internal qi wrapping the few people outside to teleport them in.

“This is indeed a spatial supreme treasure!”

The man with the mustache widened his eyes.

“It opened up such a large space in the void. Moreover, this is not a dead space, but a living being space.”

This ring was definitely something that only mighty realm cultivators could refine. The man with the mustache went round inside, and his expression became even more surprised.

“Moreover, there are many complicated formations here, which is why this space is always full of spiritual qi. F*ck, there’s also a teleportation formation here. One can teleport the people to this void directly if he’s no match for them. This is too shameless! I wouldn’t trade it even for ten tribulation magical artifacts!”

The man with the mustache drooled even more.

“Elder Guai, this ring is too precious. I can’t take it.”

Qin Yu said solemnly.

He did not save the three for the sake of benefits. Now that Elder Guai wanted to give him this supreme treasure, he could not accept it.

“Qin Yu, I can’t safeguard this ring if it’s on me. In the future, I’ll rely on you to care for Xiaoru and little ginseng. I’ll just enjoy my life here.”

Elder Guai laughed happily, not caring at all.

“Accept it first. What nonsense are you talking about?”

The man with the mustache was afraid that the old man would go back on his word, so he quickly agreed on behalf of Qin Yu.

At this moment, not wasting time, Qin Yu sat cross-legged.

He began to absorb the spiritual energy in the space. The Traceless Immortal Scripture started circulating, and the spiritual energy surged into his body at a terrifying speed.

As the battle nearly exhausted the spiritual energy in his body just now, he urgently needed to replenish it.

“F*ck, such a domineering cultivation method!”

The man with the mustache looked at Qin Yu, who was madly absorbing spiritual energy, and said in amazement.

He did not expect Qin Yu to deliberately suppress it, afraid that he would deplete the spiritual energy here.

The Spirit Inducing Formation in the Sumeru Space also felt the reduction of spiritual energy and moved toward the nearby space to absorb the energy.

After half a month, Qin Yu finally opened his eyes.

As soon as he opened his eyes, he saw Xiaoru and Little Fatty playing around while Elder Guai leisurely making tea by the side.

“How I wish Ruoxue is here.”

Qin Yu’s sad emotions flashed past, but soon a determined gaze replaced them.

“It’s still not enough!”

Even though the spiritual energy was abundant, it could not satisfy Qin Yu’s spiritual energy needs.

He looked at this space and suddenly had an idea.

“I’m going to the depths of purgatory to train for a while. What are your plans?”

Qin Yu said to the man with the mustache.

“I happen to have something to do. When you’re done with cultivating, bring me to see Wang Feng,” the man with the mustache thought for a moment.

“Okay!”

Qin Yu sent the man with the mustache out of the Sumeru ring. The man with the mustache had always been mysterious, and he never had much interest in cultivation. Qin Yu thus did not force him to go to purgatory with him.

Qin Yu immediately concealed his internal qi and left the city.

After reaching the fourth level of purgatory, Qin Yu began his cultivation.

After each demon beast hunt, he would return to the Sumeru ring to cultivate.

When he reached the seventh level, the number of demon beasts became lesser.

However, each was a demonic beast in the True Saint Realm. Coupled with the unique advantages of demonic beasts, it was still somewhat difficult for Qin Yu to deal with them.

“Clang!”

Qin Yu returned to the Sumeru ring with his body covered in blood and threw out a dozen inner cores.

He held the inner cores and circulated the Meridian Circulation Technique. Soon, he depleted the demonic qi of the inner cores of the True Saint demonic beasts.

At this moment, the spiritual energy in his body was surging. After ten years of cultivation, he had already entered the third grade relying on this crazy mode. He was only one step away from reaching the fourth grade.

“Qin Yu, don’t work too hard. Your body needs rest too.”

Elder Guai frowned and said. Qin Yu had been cultivating in such a crazy manner for the past ten years, and it somewhat shocked him.

“It’s alright, Elder Guai. I’ll rest if my body can’t take it.”

Qin Yu grinned and said.

He did not have time to waste. In the Holy Region, there was no shortage of spiritual energy. In terms of resources, there was no advantage over the Holy Region. Therefore, he could only work harder.

There were still thirty years or so away from the hundred-year date!

Qin Yu clenched his fists.

Ruoxue, this time, I must stand in front to shield you.

Qin Yu felt his heart dripping with blood when he thought of how Yan Ruoxue unleashed the Nine Destiny Transformation for him.

“Brother Qin Yu, come play with us!”

Little Fatty and Xiaoru each hugged one of Qin Yu’s legs and said with a smile.

With Qin Yu’s help, his spiritual soul had already recovered remarkably.

“Haha, then I’ll tickle you!”

Qin Yu’s mood suddenly improved tremendously after seeing the two cute children.

After playing for a while, Qin Yu appeared in purgatory again.

At this moment, a black hole appeared in front of him.

He hesitated for a while before stepping into the seventh level of purgatory.

As far as the eye could see, demonic qi was dense and black smoke billowed.

Not far away, a volcano erupted, and the air smelled of sulfur.

All of a sudden, a magnificent divine sense flashed.

Qin Yu’s divine sense quickly entered the pearl, and a dense demonic qi spread out.

“Is this the divine sense of the Peak of True Saint or above?”

Qin Yu was a little shocked.

If his divine sense weren’t sharp, he would have been locked on directly.

The owner of the divine thought seemed to have detected him the moment he stepped into the seventh level.

Qin Yu frowned as he moved forward. Along the way, the smell of blood assaulted his nostrils.

There were demon beasts engaging in a life-and-death battle almost at regular intervals.

Moreover, these demon beasts fought one-on-one, and there were no group attacks between races.

The victorious demon beasts devoured the flesh and blood of the losers and returned to their mountain peaks.

Soon after, other demonic beasts came to fight fiercely.

“Howl!”

A sharp shrill cry came from the seventh level all of a sudden.

As is in response to the howl, Qin Yu felt a dense demonic qi as countless birds and beasts rushed in from the entrance.

And these demonic beasts were at least at the Reversion Void Stage.

Then these demon beasts began a new round of “one-on-one”.

Qin Yu felt it strange. It was like a martial arts competition.

The demonic beasts were fighting one-on-one as if someone was organizing them.

“Hello? Why aren’t you listening to my commands? I want to challenge this vulture.”

A rough voice sounded from behind Qin Yu.

“Alright, I’ll leave now.”

Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“This is a human cultivator!”

Xuan Ren’s expression suddenly turned furious upon hearing this inexplicable response.

He slapped down with his claw, but it hit nothing.

Qin Yu used the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique to flee ten meters away.

“Whoosh!”

With a sharp cry, a vulture struck Qin Yu’s back like lightning.

However, the claw comparable to the divine weapon could not penetrate further after piercing the skin.

Qin Yu turned his head coldly and pointed with two fingers. The vulture’s inner core had already entered his hand.

“It’s you again, brat! You’re courting death!”

Xuan Ren was stunned as he recognized Qin Yu.
