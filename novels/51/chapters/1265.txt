Chapter 1266: I’ll accept chapter 1,266! 

Guan Zhuang muttered, “Since the Heavenly Cloud sect is known as the number one sect in the southern region, it’s naturally not for nothing.”

“It can be said that all the major sects in the Li region have some strength. Rumor has it that the Heavenly Cloud sect once produced a saint.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu immediately sucked in a breath of cold air!

A Saint? That was an existence that was unreachable!

Once one entered the saint realm, they would truly become a saint. It was definitely not something Qin Yu could compare to.

“Although that was many years ago, it’s not difficult for a saint to lead a top-tier sect,”Guan Zhuang continued.

“The treasures they left behind are enough to protect the sect for a long time.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said in a low voice, “In other words, it’s very likely that they have a saint weapon.”

“That’s right.”Guan Zhuang nodded slightly.

“As for the realm of their sect master, I’m not sure either. I only know that when they conquered the South Province a few years ago, no one was their match.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Is there no one who is their match in the South Province?”

“Of course there is,”Guan Zhuang said calmly.

“The South Province is so big, and there are countless top-notch martial artist. Not everyone is willing to establish a sect.”

“For example, the unique dance of Mount Hua Ning, qu Zhu of Mount Ning Temple, Mr. Yong Ji of Eternal City, and... forget it, why are you asking so many questions?”

Qin Yu waved his hand and did not continue asking.

However, these names were silently engraved in Qin Yu’s heart.

“Oh right, there is one more question.”At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of the key point.

“Do you know where to look for vitality?”

“Vitality?”Guan Zhuang raised his eyebrows and continued, “Are you referring to vitality?”

“That’s right.”Qin Yu hurriedly nodded.

Guan Zhuang smiled and said, “There might be vitality in the bodies of the exotic beasts in Qingyan Mountain.”

Qin Yu was instantly overjoyed when he heard that.

He hurriedly asked, “Big Brother Guan, is what you said true? The exotic beasts in Qingyan Mountain have vitality?”

Guan Zhuang nodded slightly and said, “That’s right. Not long ago, someone had struck out life energy, but the possibility of that is relatively low.”

Speaking up to this point, Guan Zhuang asked suspiciously, “What do you want life energy for?”

Qin Yu frowned, but in the end, he did not say anything.

He muttered, “I can’t tell you for the time being, but... I need a large amount of life energy. If Big Brother Guan has any ideas, please be sure to tell me.”

Guan Zhuang laughed and said, “Okay, if I find life force, I will definitely sell it to you at a low price!”

Qin Yu cupped his hands and said, “Thank you very much.”

As long as he found life force, Qin Yu would be able to recover his spiritual power.

With his current state, if he recovered his spiritual power, he did not know how powerful he would be.

“Okay, Go and prepare. I will bring you to Qingyan Forest in a while.”Guan Zhuang patted Qin Yu and then walked away.

On the other side, Jing Bai was frowning as he looked down at the few orders in his hand.

These orders were extremely difficult. They had been placed here for a long time and either no one accepted them or they failed.

For these few orders, several members of the hunter organization had already died.

“Phew.”Jing Bai slapped the orders to the side as a conflicted look appeared on his face.

“Jing Bai, What’s Wrong?”A brawny man walked up and asked.

Jing Bai said in a deep voice, “These few orders have already caused the deaths of quite a few of our brothers.”

The Brawny man glanced at the orders and nodded. “En, these exotic beasts are extremely ferocious and difficult to kill, but the rewards are indeed tempting.”

“This is what I’m worried about.”Jing Bai frowned and said.

“Because the rewards are generous enough, there are always people who come to take them. And our principle is that we can’t refuse hunters to take over the orders, which leads to many deaths.”

At this point, Jing Bai couldn’t help but clench his fists.

He gritted his teeth and said, “In order to avoid future trouble, it’s better to tear up these orders.”

After saying that, Jing Bai reached out his hand, ready to tear the orders into pieces.

The Brawny man hurriedly stopped Jing Bai and said with a frown, “This doesn’t meet the requirements.”

“I’ll be responsible for what happens,”Jing Bai said coldly.

At this moment, Qin Yu and Guan Zhuang walked over from not far away.

“Qin Yu, you can take any order here. Because it’s your first time coming to the hunter organization, it’s best to take a simple order,”Guan Zhuang said.

As he spoke, Qin Yu looked at the order in Jing Bai’s hand.

“Can you show me the Order in Your Hand?”Qin Yu asked.

“No,”Jing Bai said without hesitation.

Qin Yu frowned and asked, “Why?”

“No reason,”Jing Bai said with a cold expression.

Qin Yu spread his hands. He was too calculative.

“Jing Bai, have you forgotten the principles of the organization?”

At this moment, another person walked over from not far away.

This person had a slender figure and a noble expression. He formed a sharp contrast with the strong men around him.

When he saw this man, Jing Bai’s expression changed slightly.

“Team leader.”Guan Zhuang greeted him.

Then, the rest of the people also greeted him.

The team leader nodded one by one. Then, he looked at Jing Bai and said, “Jing Bai, why don’t you show the order to this brother?”

Jing Bai gritted his teeth. For a moment, he didn’t seem to know how to explain.

The team leader reached out for the order and was about to hand it over to Qin Yu.

But at this moment, Jing Bai grabbed the few orders in one go. A look of determination appeared on his face.

The team leader frowned and said, “Jing Bai, do you really want to violate the organization’s principles? Do you know the consequences of violating the principles?”

Jing Bai’s face became even more embarrassed. He hesitated for a long time before finally letting go.

Qin Yu took the orders from the team leader and looked at them carefully. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He found that the rewards for these orders were extremely generous. One of them even offered a high reward of 500,000 spirit coins.

Qin Yu was currently in need of spirit coins. This 500,000 spirit coins would definitely solve the urgent matter.

Therefore, Qin Yu said without hesitation, “I’ll take this.”

“No!”But at this moment, Jing Bai shouted loudly.

He grabbed the order, he said coldly, “Newcomer, let me tell you. Just because of this order, several brothers have died. This 500,000 spirit coins is a trap. You’d better not aim too high, understand?”

Qin Yu scratched his head and said, “But I think I can complete it...”

“You can complete my ass! Do you know that because of this order, several of my close friends have died? !”Jing Bai’s eyes were wide open and his veins were exposed. He looked extremely angry.
