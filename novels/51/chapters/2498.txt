2499 Terrifying Power

One could feel an intense and chilling demonic power, even outside the Sumeru World.

Unlike the vicious chill of the demonic elemental energy, it was another ice-cold internal qi of the demon race.

It was somewhat akin to the sinister coldness of a venomous snake, selective in its prey. This drop of demonic elemental energy was obtained from the Azure Dragon’s hand previously.

It could be considered an utmost high-rank devil’s elemental energy, chaotic power, and demonic elemental energy.

The moment it appeared, the entire air seemed to have become a powerful explosive, and the air was full of hints of detonation at any time.

Moreover, as the three drops of liquid approached each other, the sense of suffocation became even more intense.

“Qin Yu, try to split up this drop of power. I have a foreboding that this power erupted is not something your current body can resist.”

Yan Ruoxue looked incomparably solemn.

“Alright, I’ll do my best to split them up to the smallest. Get ready!”

Qin Yu’s expression was solemn. At this moment, he was not confident either.

This was the first time he was doing this. Three drops of liquid suddenly entered his body.

Following that, they slowly split up. Qin Yu split one-third of the demonic elemental energy from the devil’s elemental energy with all his might.

The black demonic elemental energy and the green demonic elemental energy on his left and right were under his control.

They rushed into his dantian in an instant.

Qin Yu’s entire dantian erupted like a volcano. After the demonic elemental energy and the devil’s elemental energy entered, it was like detonating a nuclear bomb.

A destructive energy erupted from his dantian and instantly spread to his limbs and bones.

Qin Yu’s pores on the surface of his body emitted a dazzling light, like a burning sun.

This power gushed out from his pores, forming an invisible energy ripple swiftly spreading in all directions.

In the Sumeru World, all turned into powder wherever the wind of the energy blew.

Yan Ruoxue’s expression changed drastically.

Qin Yu’s body broke into pieces. The Heart of the Ocean seemed to have sensed the terrifying power when the demonic elemental energy and devil’s elemental energy had just entered his dantian.

The blue water spiritual power heavily guarded his dantian, while nearly half of the remaining spiritual power drifted around various parts of his body.

Almost at the same time as the raging energy shattered his body, it began repairing his body at an incredibly rapid pace.

In less than two breaths, dozens of massive wounds appeared on Qin Yu’s body.

That terrifying wound was severely impacted from the inside out.

His blood splattered everywhere. Fortunately, the Heart of the Ocean was healing his terrifying injuries with an incredible speed.

Otherwise, these wounds, accumulated, might have directly caused him severe injuries.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and controlled the terrifying energy, allowing it to attack his six acupoints slowly.

At the same time, he slowly dissipated from his body.

If this energy could gather at one point and burst out, it could relieve the pressure on his body. However, others would notice it very readily.

Qin Yu did not want to expose his newly-comprehended strength so soon. He followed this destructive power and wandered around his body.

He felt the space in his six acupoints seemed to be getting bigger due to the impact of this power.

The meridians and blood vessels in his body had noticeably become more resilient after enduring the impact and undergoing the restoration by the power of the Heart of the Ocean.

After nearly fifteen minutes, Qin Yu finally completely calmed down the restlessness in his body.

At this moment, his face was ashen. It would take some time for his injuries to heal after the impact of this power.

Even the heaven-defying healing power of the Heart of the Ocean could not completely heal him directly.

“What a terrifying power! If you had just combined the complete demonic elemental energy with the devil’s elementary energy, I’m afraid your soul would have turned into nothingness.”

Yan Ruoxue’s face was pale, too. She had also used her most formidable power just now to shift the terrifying power to the void.

Otherwise, the Sumeru World would have been completely pulverized.

Qin Yu’s body turned cold as well. He did not expect the combination of these three powers to be so terrifying.

If he had not listened to Yan Ruoxue’s suggestion, he might have ended up like what Yan Ruoxue had said.

“The power of the Heart of the Ocean has almost been fully used to heal my injuries. I wonder when I can use it again.”

At this moment, the Heart of the Ocean had almost completely lost its reaction, just like an ordinary blue stone.

It stood quietly in Qin Yu’s dantian, and numerous water elemental powers entered from the top of Qin Yu’s head.

“However, it has opened up a new train of thought this time. How could the combination of the devil’s elemental energy and demonic elemental energy generate such a violent reaction? It seems there’s no such record in the past.”

Yan Ruoxue frowned and said.

This power would be much stronger than her ultimate power of the origin if truly unleashed.

If she could understand it thoroughly, it would definitely be of great help to Qin Yu’s path of anomaly.

“I guess it’s because of the chaotic qi. The chaotic body can absorb diverse vital energies and convert them into chaotic qi. It’s a much gentler power than spiritual energy. However, once this power exceeds the limit, it will erupt with a much more terrifying energy than the clashes of ordinary power.”

Qin Yu had analyzed it before, so he continued.

“If it’s ordinary demonic elemental energy and devil’s elemental energy, it will be immediately refined into chaotic qi after entering the body. However, there is a limit to how much it can enter and transform.

“However, these two drops of demonic elemental energy and devil’s elemental energy are extremely compressed high-grade elemental energy after being compressed by my dantian. When these two drops of elemental energy rushed into my dantian, the chaotic energy simply didn’t have time to transform. I’ve tried using demonic elemental energy and chaotic qi before, but I didn’t expect it to be so terrifying after combining it with high-grade devil’s elemental energy.”

“This is indeed a power that only the chaotic body can use. Moreover, I’m afraid you can’t use this power without the holy body and the Heart of the Ocean.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Yan Ruoxue was somewhat shocked.

Based on her spatial cultivation path, she felt this kind of cultivation path was indeed unheard of before and had broadened her horizons.

“This is also a train of thought that I comprehended by chance from cultivating the Traceless Immortal Scripture.”

The Way of Destruction of the Traceless Immortal Scripture was a terrifying power Qin Yu had come into contact with.

Moreover, many of its train of thought could be shared with Qin Yu. Wu Ji also had a chaotic body. This similar physique allowed Qin Yu to obtain more insights when cultivating the Traceless Immortal Scripture.
