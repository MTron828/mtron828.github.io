Chapter 496: Shattered With a Single Punch! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Boom!”

The collision of two extremely powerful forces instantly caused the Great Hall to collapse!

Everything in the surroundings turned into white flames. Countless people had their eyes blinded at this moment!

“Rumble...”

The two forces began to collide at this moment, and for a moment, they were at a stalemate!

“How... how could this be?” Elder Qu was extremely terrified!

These were four Martial Marquis Weapons!! They couldn’t kill Qin Yu?!

Under the impact of these four Martial Marquis Weapons, Qin Yu began to retreat continuously.

Qin Yu’s clothes were completely torn, revealinghis firm muscles!

Veins bulged on his arms, and one could even see spiritual energy being poured into his arms!

“Ah!!!”

Qin Yu raised his head and roared. The power of the Divine Dragon was unleashed to the extreme at this moment!

A light flashed between his brows, and his eyes shone with a scarlet light. In an instant, the power of his fists burst out!

A shocking scene happened. The power of the Martial Marquis Weapon was actually pushed back by Qin Yu!

“Oh no!”

Seeing this scene, Elder Qu panicked!

Could it be... Qin Yu was really going to smash this Martial Marquis Weapon? That would be a heavy loss for the Saint Confucian Sect!

“I have to escape quickly!” Elder Qu thought to himself that things were looking bad!

He took advantage of the fact that Qin Yu was busy fighting against the Martial Marquis Weapon and immediately turned around to run!

Qin Yu was still fighting against this Martial Marquis Weapon. As Qin Yu’s power erupted, the golden light became even more powerful!

“Break!”

Qin Yu let out a deafening roar. The Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist was unleashed to the extreme in an instant!

“Boom!”

The power of the Martial Marquis Weapon was shattered by Qin Yu!

Everything became silent. Qin Yu’s body was also covered in blood.

He panted heavily and roared, “What other trump cards do you have? Use them all!”

However, his surroundings were completely silent.

No one was willing to become Qin Yu’s enemy and everyone had already fled the scene.

Qin Yu glanced at his surroundings coldly and a murderous llok appeared on his face.

“Is this the number one sect in the north? From today onwards, I will kill every single person from the Saint Confucian Sect I see!” Qin Yu seemed to be announcing the death penalty.

Then, he coldly looked at the four Martial Marquis Weapons hanging high in the sky and his figure suddenly shot up!

“Boom!”

His extremely fierce fist smashed towards the four Martial Marquis Weapons!

The Martial Marquis Weapons shattered with a sound!

This was the first time in the history of the Saint Confucian Sect that they had suffered such a disaster. Everyone had fled, and they had even lost four Martial Marquis Weapons!

No one had expected that Qin Yu, who had once been looked down upon, would actually be able to cause the Saint Confucian Sect to suffer heavy losses today!

As he looked around, Qin Yu’s expression became even colder.

He turned around and walked out of the Great Hall. His powerful divine sense instantly spread out.

More than half of the Saint Confucian Sect had landed in Qin Yu’s divine sense.

Very quickly, Qin Yu found a figure.

He quickly disappeared.

A moment later, Qin Yu arrived beside a young man.

When the young man saw Qin Yu, a hint of panic flashed across his face.

He said in a trembling voice, “It has nothing to do with... It has nothing to do with me. Don’t kill me...”

Qin Yu grabbed his shoulder and said coldly, “Who killed the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?”

The young man was stunned. He scratched his ears and said softly, “Mr. Qin, I don’t understand what you mean...”

“Stop playing dumb!” Qin Yu was furious. He raised his hand and broke the young man’s legs!

The young man immediately grimaced in pain. He said in pain, “Mr. Qin, the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion isn’t dead. She was taken away by the people of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association...”

Qin Yu was stunned. He grabbed the young man and said anxiously, “Is what you said true?”

“It’s absolutely true!” The young man said with some fear.

“Just as Elder Qu was about to do something improper, the people from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association took her away.”

“I happened to clean up that day and saw it with my own eyes!”

Qin Yu’s brows immediately furrowed.

He released the young man and said in a low voice, “Could it be that Elder Qu lied to me?”

Thinking of this, Qin Yu looked at the young man coldly and said, “You’d better not lie to me.”

“I swear, I absolutely didn’t lie to you...” the young man was about to cry.

Seeing that he didn’t seem to be lying, Qin Yu didn’t make things difficult for him.

“Elder Qu...” Qin Yu had a gloomy expression.

That beast actually wanted to do something improper to the Pavilion Master! It was simply unforgivable!

“I won’t let you off lightly,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The Saint Confucian Sect was in ruins. Without any Martial Marquises holding down the fort, no one could stop Qin Yu.

Therefore, Qin Yu didn’t stay any longer. He returned to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

After returning to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, Qin Yu took out his phone and called Old Mister Yan.

After getting Yan Sihai’s phone number, Qin Yu immediately called Yan Sihai.

After about ten seconds, Yan Sihai picked up the phone.

He asked over the phone, “Who is it?”

“It’s me, Qin Yu,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Hearing this name, Yan Sihai said with some amusement, “Qin Yu? Calling me at this time? Are you trying to beg me for mercy?”

“F * ck off!” Qin Yu cursed. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

On the other end, Yan Sihai was stunned, and then he said angrily, “What did you say?! You dare to curse at me?”

“I’m cursing you! You heartless beast!” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Qin Yu, are you crazy?!” On this end, Yan Sihai was so angry that he gnashed his teeth.

In all his life, no one dared to scold him like this!

“Yan Sihai, I’m warning you, if the Pavilion Master loses even a hair, I’ll definitely skin you and pull out your tendons!” Qin Yu said coldly.

Yan Sihai couldn’t help but narrow his eyes. He sneered. “You want to save her? Fine, then come to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association to take her away!”

Qin Yu silently breathed a sigh of relief.

It seemed that the Pavilion Master had really been brought to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

As long as she was fine, Qin Yu was relieved.

“Yan Sihai, don’t worry, you b*stard. Don’t worry, I will go to Jingdu very soon,” Qin Yu said with a sneer.

On the other end, Yan Sihai suppressed the anger in his heart and said with a cold smile, “On September 9th, I’ll be waiting for you in Jingdu.”

“Oh right, I have good news for you. Preparations for Ruoxue and Han Wei’s wedding have begun.”

“Don’t you like Yan Ruoxue? I hope you won’t be a coward when the time comes.”

Qin Yu said coldly, “Okay, help me tell Han Wei that September 9th will be the anniversary of his death.”

After saying this, Qin Yu hung up the phone.

At this time, the news of Qin Yu killing ten half-step Martial Marquises and ruining the Saint Confucian Sect had already spread.

“Qin Yu killed all ten half-step Martial Marquises of the Hong Yi Sect!”

“Not only that, but Qin Yu also barged into the Saint Confucian Sect and killed nearly a hundred people! He broke four Martial Marquis Weapons!”

“Qin Yu, who has stepped into the half-step Martial Marquis realm, is indeed beyond our imagination!”

Just as everyone was discussing, a message suddenly appeared on the Martial Arts Forum:

From today onwards, I, Qin Yu, will fight the Saint Confucian Sect to the death.
