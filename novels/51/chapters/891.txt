Chapter 892: Chapter 892, the vicious eternal jade

The ice and snow glazed heart hovering above Qin Yu’s head was rapidly being consumed.

Every part of his body was flickering with light. Traces of internal Qi lingered around his golden core, flickering with a mysterious radiance.

The Palace Master of the Han Palace claimed that by devouring this object, he would be able to step into the martial saint realm.

However, this seemed to be an unlikely thing for Qin Yu.

Yan Ruoxue sat on Qin Yu’s side. She held her chin and looked at Qin Yu quietly. A smile unconsciously appeared on her face.

In the blink of an eye, a week had passed.

Within this week, Yan Ruoxue had officially stepped into the path of cultivation.

Under the environment of dense Qi/spiritual energy, Yan Ruoxue’s progress could be said to be rapid.

The bloodline in her body seemed to be boiling. The complete bloodline of the Yan family allowed her to cultivate at an extreme speed.

In just a short week, she had stepped into the grandmaster realm.

Such a speed, even Qin Yu back then was far from being able to match up to.

... . .

In the outside world.

The entire world seemed to be searching for the figures of Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue.

Whether it was the Jingdu martial arts association or the various large organizations and powers, they were all searching the entire world for Qin Yu.

But they had almost searched the entire fire country, but they were still unable to find Qin Yu.

In just a few days, Qin Yu seemed to have disappeared from the world.

“Strange, where did this Qin Yu go after all.”In a certain upscale hotel, Wan Gu Qiong can not help but frown.

He touched his chin and said in a low voice, “The world is so big, I don’t believe he can disappear into thin air?”

“It doesn’t matter if you can find Qin Yu or not, but you must find Yan Ruoxue first no matter what.”The martial saint said in a low voice.

“Everyone knows clearly what Yan Ruoxue’s bloodline means. If it falls into the hands of someone else, it will be troublesome.”

When Wan Guqiong heard this, a trace of viciousness could not help but flash across his eyes.

He slowly stood up and said, “If Qin Yu doesn’t show up, kill the people around him! Kill until he shows up!”

Standing in front of the window, a trace of viciousness flashed across Wan Guqiong’s eyes.

“Let me be the villain.”Wan guqiong grinned and sneered.

He took out his cell phone and called Yao Meng and the others, claiming that he invited them to the banquet.

In the evening, many young masters of aristocratic families were invited to the Green Moon Villa.

“Why did Wan Guqiong suddenly invite us to the banquet? What is his intention?”Zhuang Teng asked with some doubt.

Kong Yun, who was standing at the side, snorted coldly and said, “He is a sinister and cunning person. I feel sick to my stomach whenever I see him. If it wasn’t for my father who asked me to build a good relationship with the people in the secret realm, I would never have come.”

Chu Hedao also nodded and said, “Yes, ever since someone stepped into the Martial Saint Realm, the secret realm has been completely exposed to the public. The resources they possess have also moved many people.”

Everyone discussed animatedly, but Yao Meng remained silent.

She had a bad premonition in her heart.

Right at this moment, Wan Gu Qiong suddenly arrived with two martial saints.

The moment the martial saints appeared, a powerful sense of oppression assaulted their faces!

Even the geniuses of Jingdu felt their hearts palpitate for a moment.

“Welcome, everyone.”Wan Gu Qiong swept his gaze across the crowd with an expression of a small person who had achieved success.

Kong Yun snorted coldly and turned his face to the side.

Wan Gu Qiong did not mind. He said indifferently, “Everyone is here to give me face. I, Wan, am here to thank you.”

“Young Master Wan, if you have something to say, just say it. Everyone is very busy,”chu he dao interrupted Wan Gu Qiong.

Wan Gu Qiong was not in a hurry. He said with a faint smile, “During this period of time, we have been looking for Qin Yu. I think everyone knows it. I wonder if anyone here knows his whereabouts?”

“How would we know? Even if we knew, we would not tell you.”Kong Yun said with a cold face.

Wan guqiong laughed loudly and said, “In order to find Qin Yu, we are willing to pay any price and use any means.”

“Today, I will let everyone experience the methods of our Wan family.”

After he finished speaking, Wan Guqiong brought the two martial saints and Strode into the Jade Moon Villa.

The Jade Moon villa was peaceful, and Wan Guqiong stood there like a god who controlled life.

Following Wan Guqiong’s arrival, many disciples of the Jade Moon Villa also walked out one after another.

Among them, the leader was naturally Zhen Yue.

“I wonder why Young Master Wan has come to my Jade Moon Villa.”Zhen Yue walked forward and bowed slightly.

Wan guqiong glanced at Zhen Yue and said indifferently, “As far as I know, this Jade Moon villa is inextricably linked to Qin Yu.”

“Now, Qin Yu abandoned you and fled for his life. I can’t find him. Tell me, what should I do?”

Hearing this, everyone had a bad premonition.

“No Answer? Fine, let me tell you the answer,”Wan Guqiong said in a low voice.

In the next second, his eyes turned cold and he suddenly stretched out his palm!

A disciple of the Green Moon Villa was instantly caught in his hand!

The huge force made this disciple unable to move!

Wan Gu Qiong glanced at everyone and said coldly, “This is only the beginning. Before Qin Yu appears, I will kill all of you one by one.”

Before he finished his words, Wan Gu Qiong stretched out his sharp claws and pulled at the Disciple’s skin! Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

His palm was like a sharp blade, directly cutting open a hole in the Disciple’s skin!

Under everyone’s watchful eyes, Wan Gu Qiong peeled off his human skin!

Such a shocking scene made everyone inhale a breath of cold air, and some people even vomited on the spot!

“AH... Ah! ! !”Finally, someone could not bear the fear and shouted desperately!

“I... I want to leave the Jade Moon Villa! It has nothing to do with me... It has nothing to do with me!”

“Don’t kill me, don’t kill me...”

When he saw this scene, a trace of a cold smile appeared on Wan Gu Qiong’s face.

He looked at the two martial saints beside him and the two martial saints immediately understood.

They gently closed their palms and the entire space of the Jade Moon Villa was immediately sealed!

It was impossible to escape!

“If you want to retreat now, it’s too late.”Wan Gu Qiong grinned, revealing a vicious smile.

Seeing this scene, everyone’s expressions changed dramatically.

Although these young masters of Jingdu had always looked down on ordinary warriors, they were also people who had undergone higher education.

No one could bear to see such cruel methods!

“I will slowly torture you. Don’t worry, I have many methods,”Wan guqiong said with a cold smile.

“Before long, I will turn the Green Moon Villa into a real purgatory on Earth!”

Kong Yun couldn’t help but shout from the side, “Wan Guqiong! Aren’t you going too far!”

Wan guqiong glanced at him and said with a faint smile, “Too far?”

Kong Yun gritted his teeth and said, “Even if you want to kill someone, there’s no need to use such cruel methods!”

Wan Gu Qiong sneered, “What does it have to do with you?”

“F * ck you!”Kong Yun pulled off his suit and pointed at Wan Gu Qiong’s nose and scolded, “Do you dare to fight me for 300 rounds!”

Wan Gu Qiong narrowed his eyes and sneered, “Do you want to be my enemy for these ants?”
