Chapter 2641: Avici Dao’s Three Blades

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

However, at this moment, Qin Yu’s divine soul seemed to have also been impacted by Saber Dao intent. His divine soul was in intense pain.

Not only did this saber have a physical form, but it also had a powerful saber intent.

“You’re the first one who can counterattack in my saber domain,” Pang De said softly.

“Avici Dao’s Three Sabers, Ah Dao!”

A storm-like power suddenly descended, and the saber that extinguished the divine flame appeared again.

As it slashed out, the continuous torrential rain of saber momentum was continuously triggered. This was a true continuous saber.

Pang De’s power once again enveloped Qin Yu, pulling him into the saber domain.

The violent saber momentum cut countless wounds on Qin Yu’s body.

In just an instant, Qin Yu’s body was enveloped in many bloody mists.

Even after absorbing Ming Xie’s power, he was still very weak in front of this saber momentum.

“If I’m not mistaken, your strength has yet to recover. If you can only attack my soul, you won’t be able to take me down today,” Qin Yu suddenly said. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

He realized that even though the divine flame had been extinguished, the attack did not cause much damage to his physical body.

The seemingly exaggerated wounds did not seriously injure any of his internal organs. As long as he used his Saint Power to recover, he would be able to return to his original state.

On the contrary, the two sabers were attacking his divine soul, as if Saber Demon Pang De had no choice.

“Then we can try.” Pang De attacked Qin Yu with his Ah Dao, his expression remaining impassive.

The storm-like saber momentum descended once again. Qin Yu suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood.

However, that was all. His divine soul was so strong that it was not something that the Saber Dao intent could destroy.

“Heh, his divine soul is not simple. He has condensed a divine soul dragon pearl. A human’s divine soul cannot bear the pain of condensing a divine soul dragon pearl. I wonder how he did it,” Wu Tian said with a smile.

“Avici Saber!”

As soon as the Avici Saber appeared, Qin Yu’s face turned pale again.

This saber technique was very strange. It seemed to revolve around the nose, and the saber momentum was as unpredictable as the air current in the nasal cavity.

The Avici Saber had many changes, the saber light was like mist, and the saber momentum was like a dream, often making the enemy unable to grasp where the saber intent was.

Originally, Qin Yu’s divine soul could still barely withstand the impact of the saber momentum, but once the saber momentum was unleashed, Qin Yu could no longer capture that elusive saber intent.

Saber momentum after saber momentum caused great damage to Qin Yu’s divine soul.

A large amount of blood spurted out of Qin Yu’s mouth and nose, but he did not make a sound. He could still endure the pain.

Since he couldn’t hide, he might as well not resist.

Under the gaze of the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze, he watched the saber momentum of Ah Dao, the saber momentum of Avici Blade continuously bombard his divine soul over and over again.

Force, domain, Order of Rules, once one comprehended force, they would be able to enter the domain in this Saint Kingdom and the Order of Rules. “What a terrifvinz willDower. And vou seem to want to use this to comDrehend the rules here and reach the Dao Consciousness Realm. Unfortunately, even if you reach the Dao Consciousness Realm, you are still no match for Pang De.

You can only stand here because he recognizes you.”

The Avici Saber subsided, and Qin Yu’s body emerged from the saber domain. He still did not fall.

“You are indeed very powerful to withstand two of my Avici Saber strikes. In this realm, it has been a long time since anyone has compelled me to resort to using the third saber for an attack.”

Pang De withdrew the saber in his hand and threw it behind him.

He faced the air with his palm like a child playing toy and slashed at Qin Yu with his saber.

“Dao Saber!” Pang De said softly.

With a wave of his hand, Qin Yu felt as if he had fallen into boundless darkness.

It was as if he had lost all hope of a bright future after this attack. He could see the bleak end of everything he had pursued in an instant.

He saw the entire timeline after the Saint Kingdom, he saw his life and death separation with Ruoxue.

He saw himself and all his friends walking further and further away. He saw an endless abyss, and the black Dao Saber shattered his hopes one by one.

In Qin Yu’s divine sense, he seemed to be able to see an unknown creature lurking beside him. He could even sense it grinning at him and laughing.

This was the Order of the Saint Kingdom involved in the Dao Saber. Just as Immortal Emperor Yao had said, this Order of Rules had its thoughts!

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and regained his last bit of consciousness.

He used all his strength to face the saber in front of his head.

In an instant, this saber directly pierced through Qin Yu’s head.

Qin Yu’s body suddenly entered another space as his soul was pulled.

Twenty seconds. Qin Yu suddenly found himself back twenty seconds ago. Previously, his limit was fifteen seconds.

After absorbing Ming Xie’s Saint Power and the baptism of victory in Nine Tune City, his time was extended to 20 seconds.

In an instant, Qin Yu’s body appeared in front of them again.

“The Heart of the Saint Kingdom? What a powerful force! This seems to be the

Order of Saint Kingdom’s top five rankings! In the past, when the Saint Kingdom changed rulers, it would usually take an extremely long time for the heaven -defying top ten Order of Saint Kingdom to erupt with their power, only then would they be able to find the way and the path. Why did the top five rankings of the Order of Saint Kingdom emerge so quickly this time?”

Wu Tian’s expression changed drastically when the power burst out from Qin Yu’s body. Then, he looked ecstatic.

“The ability to resurrect? However, if that’s all you have, then it would be a waste to give this power to you. Give me your power.”

Saber Demon Pang De laughed loudly, his long hair suddenly fluttering in the wind.

He had been very silent before, but now that he had unleashed the Avici Dao’s Three Sabers, he was completely stunned.

His personality had suddenly undergone a huge change as if it was the aftereffect of using the Dao Saber.

“Show me your strength! Three sabers in one.”

Pang De let out a roar.

A huge tremor suddenly came from under his feet. The saber energy that was nearly ten meters long slashed down at Oin Yu. This powerful force caused some cracks to appear on the ground under his feet.

In the Saint Kingdom, this kind of destructive power was already extremely rare.

Qin Yu did not say anything in the face of this saber.

He had been observing the first and second saber moves for a long time, especially the saber intent of the third saber move.

The black power of rules was moving around in his divine soul like a living thing. This kind of close contact made him feel the true essence of the third slash.

After time flashed, Qin Yu’s Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze suddenly locked onto those rules.

As he appeared again, the power of the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze chased after him.

Boom! The moment his eyes saw it, tens of thousands of furious lightning bolts suddenly struck down from the Saint Kingdom..
