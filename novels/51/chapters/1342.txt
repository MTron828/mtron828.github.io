Chapter 1343: Chapter 1,343, Flower Appreciation Party 1 

Hearing Old Wang’s words, the city lord hurriedly pulled him back.

“Old Wang, you must tell the sect master about the situation at that time,”the city Lord said with extreme worry.

Old Wang rolled his eyes and said, “What are you afraid of? Even if you want to settle the score, you’ll have to settle it with Wen Wanyi. What has it got to do with you?”

Even though that was the case, the city lord was still extremely worried in his heart.

He had been in power for many years, and he could be said to have an extremely good understanding of power strategies.

Many things were not about analyzing right and wrong, but analyzing the pros and cons.

If he really wanted to find someone to take the blame, it would definitely be the city lord. It would definitely not be Wen Wanli, because the price would be too high.

On the other side, Qin Yu was lying in his room, waiting for Wen Wanli’s return.

Qin Yu had a lot of doubts in her heart. Maybe Wen Wanji could answer them.

Another Day passed.

Wen Da and Wen er excitedly found Qin Yu. They smiled and said, “Tonight is the flower appreciation party. You have to be prepared.”

Qin Yu sat up from the bed and said, “What do I have to be prepared for?”

“There are a lot of girls there. You have to dress up properly,”Wen da said.

“That’s right, that’s right. Moreover, many young disciples, scholars, and even famous people will come to the flower show,”Wen er said.

Wen Da came forward and whispered, “Have you heard of the unique dance?”

“Unique dance? The unique dance of Mount Hua Ning?”Qin Yu was stunned.

Qin Yu had heard of this person from Guan Zhuang.

When Qin Yu had asked Guan Zhuang if there was anyone who was not afraid of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, Guan Zhuang had told him about the unique dance of Mount Hua Ning.

“TSK TSK, you know quite a lot.”Wen Da rolled his eyes and said, “Let me tell you, the unique dance almost never misses any flower appreciation event! If you can woo her, you don’t have to be afraid of anything in the future!”

Qin Yu immediately laughed bitterly.

“I don’t want to hide behind a woman,”Qin Yu muttered.

If he wanted to hide behind a woman, then why not go look for Yan Ruoxue.

Although Jue Wu was strong, she was only limited to the southern region, or rather, the Li region.

In the entire holy region, there were many people who were stronger than her.

Compared to the nine great clans of the Holy Region, Jue Wu was nothing.

“Kid, it seems like you don’t know absolute dance very well.”Wen da rubbed his chin and said.

“That’s an existence even more powerful than my grandfather! As long as she takes a fancy to you, the Heavenly Cloud sect won’t dare to do anything to You!”

Qin Yu waved her hand and said, “Alright, Alright, I got it.”

“Dress well. Tonight Is Your Chance!”Wen Da patted Qin Yu’s shoulder.

Then, Wen da even asked someone to deliver a set of luxurious clothes.

Qin Yu originally didn’t want to wear it, but this was after all a gift from Wen Da, so Qin Yu couldn’t refuse.

After changing clothes, Qin Yu walked out of the room.

“TSK TSK, as expected, people rely on clothes and horses. If you change into this set of clothes, your looks are comparable to mine!”Wen Da gave a thumbs up.

Qin Yu rolled her eyes and said, “Shameless.”

“Alright, let’s hurry up and set off. We won’t be able to make it in a while,”Wen er said hurriedly.

The three of them didn’t say anything else and immediately rushed towards the flower appreciation society.

The flower appreciation society was against the border of the Great Yue. This place was filled with green mountains and rivers, but it had been artificially altered. It was extremely beautiful.

The flowers here were called the ancient flowers. They only bloomed once every ten years, and the beauty of the ancient flowers surpassed any other kind of flowers in the world.

It was said that anyone who had seen the eternal flowers would be mesmerized by them, especially women.

Qin Yu followed the Wen brothers to the flower viewing event.

At this moment, the flower viewing event was already packed with people. Almost everyone was dressed in bright and beautiful clothes.

However, compared to the eternal flowers that filled the mountains and plains, these peerless beauties seemed to have turned into green leaves.

“It smells so good.”Qin Yu sniffed her nose forcefully and felt her entire body relax.

“Of course, the body fragrance of a beautiful woman is the best.”Wen da wiped his saliva and said with a lecherous look.

There were many people reciting poems in the flower appreciation meeting, and there were also people tasting wine.

As for Wen Da and Wen Er, they chatted everywhere.

The way they chatted up was also very simple and violent.

“Beautiful woman, my grandfather is Wen Wanli. Can We Talk?”

“Baby, you’re So Pretty. My grandfather is Wen Wanli. Shall we admire the flowers together?”

One had to admit that their method was very effective. Many people heard that they were Wen Wanli’s grandsons and were interested in befriending them.

Qin Yu was not very interested in these things, and the beauty of the ancient flowers did not attract Qin Yu.

He wanted to see what kind of person the legendary swan dance was.

At this moment, four or five young geniuses walked toward Qin Yu and the others.

They were three men and two women. They were elegant, handsome, and had an extraordinary aura.

“Look, those two idiots from the Wen family are embarrassing themselves,”a young man in the crowd said faintly.

“Hehe, these two idiots have completely embarrassed Wen Wanwei.”

“That’s right. Today is the flower viewing event. We might as well go over and tease him.”

The few of them hit it off and immediately walked towards Wen Da and Wen Er.

“Young Master Wen, long time no see.”One of the slender youths said with a faint smile.

Seeing this youth, Wen da said with some displeasure, “Zhu Lan? Stay away from me. I get annoyed whenever I see you.”

The young man called Zhu Lan said with a faint smile, “Young Master Wen, I miss you a lot. How is it? You’ve caused a lot of trouble for your grandfather recently, haven’t You?”

“F * ck your grandfather!”Wen Da was instantly furious. Wen Er hurriedly stopped him from the side and said in a low voice, “There are beautiful women. Pay attention to your image.”FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
