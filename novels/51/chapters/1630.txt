At this moment, the Elementalist’s internal Qi was not very stable. If not for the immortal slaying sect’s many forbidden secret technique’s support, it was hard to say if they would have won.

“Master, what should we do next?”A godly monarch asked.

The elementalist glanced at them and then said coldly, “As you can see, the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect will not make a move. So... bring some people to conquer the southern region immediately.”

Upon hearing this, the few godly monarchs were a little worried.

“But... There are nine people in the nine caves. Only two of them have died. If the remaining seven people make a move, I’m afraid we’ll be doomed,”Sima Bei said in a deep voice.

The elementalist snorted. Although he was displeased, this was the truth.

The nine old monsters in the nine caves were extremely powerful. Even the young elementalists almost died.

“Wait for me to rest for a few days. I will personally lead you on the expedition,”the Elementalist said coldly.

The few godly monarchs immediately heaved a sigh of relief.

“Master, the nine caves joined hands to attack Xiao Hai. However, they failed in the end. The strength of the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect is definitely not inferior to Xiao Hai,”a godly monarch beside him said worriedly.

Although he did not say it explicitly, his intention was very obvious.

The elementalist sneered and said, “After I recover, the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect is not worth mentioning!”

With his words, everyone could be considered relieved.

After that, the few of them temporarily retreated to the northern lands.

The Elementalist’s recovery ability was extremely strong. Although he was injured, he could recover to his peak condition in a few days.

This made everyone in the southern region even more worried. The sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect did not want to show his face. No one knew who would carry this banner next.

Sky Cloud Sect’s sect.

The Deputy Sect Master’s face was ashen.

Towards the sect master, he was even more furious.

“Even the nine monsters have made a move, but he still hasn’t shown his face...”the deputy sect master gnashed his teeth in extreme disappointment.

“Yeah, what exactly is the sect master thinking? Could it be that he really doesn’t care about the Southern Region?”

For a moment, everyone in the sect sighed repeatedly.

In the next few days, the entire southern region was shrouded in an atmosphere of despair.

The nine-hole old monster would definitely make a move, but he did not dare to make any wild guesses.

Northern region.

The elementalist’s body walked straight into the huge snow mountain, as if he had become one with the snow mountain.

The four godly monarchs stood in front of the Snow Mountain, waiting for the orders of the Lord of the northern region.

“I will need to rest for a few days. When I come out of seclusion again, I will bring all the northern region’s cultivators and attack the southern region.”The Elementalist’s voice came from the ice mountain coldly.

“Yes.”The four godly monarchs bowed.

A gust of cold wind blew past and everything became calm.

In a room in the northern region.

Yong Ji was closing his eyes. His hands were clasped together and he was mumbling as if he was trying to calm himself down.

However, no matter what, he could not calm himself down. Sweat kept dripping down his forehead.

“Damn it...”

Eternal limit had ultimately failed. He suddenly opened his eyes and clenched his fists tightly.

All along, he had thought that he was the number one person other than the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect and Xiao Hai. However, after experiencing this battle, he realized that he could not be counted in the southern region at all!

The so-called three madmen and three absolutes were just an undeserved reputation in the secular world!

In other words, the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect probably did not take him seriously at all. He had never taken him seriously!

Now that he had come to the northern lands, he was still not taken seriously. The four godly monarchs had not landed on his head at all!

“Why? Are you very unwilling?”

At this moment, he teng walked in from outside.

He sat beside Yong Ji with a faint smile on his face.

Yong Ji gave he teng a cold glance and said, “What are you doing here?”

He Teng said with a faint smile, “It seems that you are filled with resentment towards me. Why? Do you feel that you have brought me to the northern lands and taken your position?”

Yong Ji snorted coldly and did not say anything.

He Teng looked at Yong Ji in front of him and sighed, “Looking at you now, I can’t help but think of the past me.”

“Back then, I was also in high spirits and was known as the pride of the generation. At that time, I was really glorious.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Speaking up to this point, he Teng’s tone changed and then he said coldly, “Until Qin Yu appeared later. He broke all my illusions! He made me lose everything!”

“Qin Yu?”Yong Ji was slightly surprised.

He Teng waved his hand, and he did not continue this topic, instead, he intentionally or unintentionally said, “Everything is fought for by oneself. Those who looked down on me were ultimately trampled under my feet. Of course, except for Qin Yu.”

Yong Ji narrowed his eyes slightly and said, “What do you mean by that?”

He teng smiled and said, “I know that you are an ambitious person. You are definitely not willing to submit to others.”

Once these words were said, Yong Ji immediately berated, “Don’t talk nonsense!”

“Don’t worry. I’m not sent here to test you. In this world, no one can use me, he teng. I can only make use of them.”He Teng said with a faint smile.

“You and I are the same person. What you think in your heart is also what I want in My Heart.”

After saying this, he teng did not say anything more.

He stood up and patted Yong Ji’s shoulder, then turned around and walked out.

Yong Ji’s expression was gloomy. He did not say a word. No one knew what he was thinking about.

...

In the following time, the South region once again welcomed a short period of peace.

However, everyone knew in their hearts that this was only the calm before the storm. The northern lands could make a comeback at any time.

“Hopefully, the seven old monsters of the southern region will make a move together and kill the Master of the northern lands next time,”someone secretly said.

At this point, they could only place their hopes on the remaining seven people in the nine caves.

Xiao Hai’s grave.

It had been a long time since anyone had come here. In the face of a great disaster, heroes had become the faith of the people, but no one had the mood to come and worship them.

The grave was emitting a faint glow. The glow looked extremely fragile, but it was indestructible.

Today, a person had come to the grave.

That person was none other than the sect master of the Tianyun sect, Xiao Sheng.

He looked at the tombstone and sighed, “Xiao Hai, are you really dead? You have experienced countless trials and tribulations since you were young. You have escaped death many times. Even the nine holes back then were defeated by your hands.”

“You must know that even I was not confident of defeating them at that time.”

As he spoke, Xiao Sheng squatted in front of the tomb.

He took out a pot of wine and raised his head to drink half of it. The rest was scattered on the ground.

“Speaking of which, it seems that we have never fought before.”Xiao Sheng continued.

“Even if I were to forcefully attack you, you would never fight me. You would rather be injured by me.”

The expression on Xiao Sheng’s face was extremely complicated. He loved this brother of his deeply.

Now that he was looking at his brother’s grave, he was not resigned.

“I heard that there is a forbidden secret technique in the northern lands that can bring back a person’s divine sense. It is rumored that only the master of the northern lands knows about this secret technique. I don’t know if it is true or false.”

Xiao Sheng raised his hand and placed it on the tombstone, muttering softly.
