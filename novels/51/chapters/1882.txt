1883 The Proud Si Shiyu

The mysterious voice was chanting, and countless figures were tangling with Qin Yu.

Qin Yu did not dare to be negligent. He protected his primordial spirit and held his breath, for he feared that his primordial spirit would be damaged again, and his divine sense would be disturbed. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

At this moment, Qin Yu only felt that it was incomparably dangerous. If he had not deliberately strengthened his primordial spirit earlier, he would probably have been suppressed by the life-and-death diagram today!

Guarding his divine sense, Qin Yu clenched the Golden Fist and shattered the figures one after another.

However, these figures were formed by the life-and-death diagram. It was the power of the life-and-death diagram and a secret technique. Even if Qin Yu destroyed all the figures, they could reconstruct themselves instantly.

One after another, the figures seemed to have traveled through the ages and vowed to kill Qin Yu!

The power they contained was weird and terrifying, so Qin Yu had to be cautious.

“Buzz!”

Another mysterious sound rang out, directly attacking Qin Yu’s primordial spirit!

Under such a severe injury, Qin Yu only felt his vision go black and blood suddenly flowed out of his mouth. Even his primordial spirit was shaking slightly, and he was almost destroyed!

“What a terrifying power!” Qin Yu was incomparably shocked, and he was even more cautious about the nine great aristocratic families now!

Qin Yu squinted his eyes and looked at the approaching figures. His mind suddenly was as clear as a mirror.

If he wanted to get out of the suppression of the life-and-death diagram, he had to see through everything and destroy the origin of the life-and-death diagram. Otherwise, everything would be in vain!

Immediately after, Qin Yu’s eyes emitted a divine light. He activated his desolate divine eye and dashed out!

With the augmentation of the desolate divine eye, nothing could escape from his sight!

Soon, he saw through the dao technique inside the life-and-death diagram and found the core!

Qin Yu roared furiously, stepped on the line word formula, and quickly closed in!

However, what shocked Qin Yu was that his fist could not touch the core of the life-and-death diagram at all!

Qin Yu had no choice but to release his primordial spirit. The small dagger flew out from between his eyebrows again and slashed at it!

“Buzz!”

With a slash, Qin Yu successfully destroyed the core!

The life-and-death diagram transformed by Si Shiyu’s secret technique collapsed and began to dissipate!

Qin Yu walked out from the suppression. His eyes were shining brightly and full of battle intent. He looked at Si Shiyu coldly, who was not far away.

Si Shiyu seemed to have been severely injured as blood kept flowing out of his mouth.

The injuries healed by the life diagram surfaced at this moment, and cracks began to appear on his body!

“Si Shiyu is going to lose,” someone said in a low voice.

Although the life-and-death diagram was terrifying, the wounds it had healed would reappear if it could not suppress his opponent.

Unless Si Shiyu could form the life-and-death diagram once again!

Qin Yu strode forward and said coldly, “Do you still want to fight?”

Si Shiyu wiped away the blood that kept flowing out of the corner of his mouth and said coldly, “To be able to walk out of the life-and-death diagram, you do have some ability. But if you and I were to have a life-and-death battle, you would definitely lose!”

“What a brag!” Qin Yu said coldly.

In fact, Qin Yu was also incomparably shocked at this moment.

This battle did not seem problematic, but Qin Yu had pushed himself to the end of his rope.

The life-and-death diagram alone had almost made Qin Yu unable to walk out.

It was no exaggeration to say that Qin Yu already displayed all of his techniques in this battle!

The fighting word formula, the power of the primordial spirit, or even the desolate divine eye, without any of these, Qin Yu would have been completely suppressed by the life-and-death diagram and become a puppet!

The injuries on Si Shiyu’s body continued to worsen, but he didn’t seem to feel any pain and completely ignored the injuries.

“You’re not my match,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Si Shiyu raised his head, sighed, and said, “You’ve thought too highly of yourself. I’m a descendant of the Si family. How can I suppress you with my cultivation realm?”

Qin Yu was stunned, and his expression changed drastically!

“Chu Shiyu, what do you mean?” Qin Yu shouted.

Si Shiyu looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “What? You don’t understand? If I hadn’t suppressed my cultivation realm to the Early-stage of Reversion Void, do you think you could defeat me?”

After saying that, Si Shiyu’s body exploded with power again!

This power was incredibly terrifying, and the dispiritedness earlier was swept away!

Obviously, it was Si Shiyu’s true power!

He had been suppressing his cultivation realm to fight with Qin Yu just now!

But even so, this battle still made Qin Yu feel extremely difficult!

The surrounding people were also extremely amazed! They didn’t expect that Si Shiyu would be so righteous!

“You…” Qin Yu opened his mouth, looking at Si Shiyu in front of him, did not know what to say.

“Qin Yu, you don’t have to say anything,” Si Shiyu said coldly. “I’m not doing this for you but myself. I can’t get over myself if I were to suppress you with my cultivation realm.”

Qin Yu remained silent, but he fully understood it.

He had lost this battle.

If Si Shiyu had restored his cultivation realm to its original state, Qin Yu would have had no chance of winning.

“Not bad! Not bad! As expected of a descendant of the Si family,” Dean Lei nodded slightly and said.

...

The rest of the people also sighed with emotion. Obviously, Si Shiyu was a proud person.

Qin Yu opened his mouth and was about to admit defeat when the powerful internal qi on Si Shiyu’s body disappeared.

He raised his head and looked at Dean Lei. He cupped his hands and said, “Dean Lei, I’ve lost.”

As soon as he said this, the scene was in an uproar!

Si Shiyu actually admitted defeat? He could have easily defeated Qin Yu!

“Si Shiyu, I should be the one to admit defeat. You and I both know that I’m not your match,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Si Shiyu glanced at Qin Yu, snorted, and said, “If I can only defeat you by relying on my cultivation realm, then what’s the difference between that and losing?”

After saying this, Si Shiyu left the battlefield without even looking back.

Qin Yu was speechless for a moment. He couldn’t help but respect Si Shiyu from the bottom of his heart.

This fellow was truly a worthy opponent.

At this moment, Si Shiyu suddenly stopped in his tracks.

...

He looked back at Qin Yu, sneered, and said, “If that’s all you have, you’re definitely not Si Shiyue’s match. You both have chaotic bodies, but you’re not as good as him.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “What do you mean?”

“Think about it yourself.” Without saying anything else, Si Shiyu turned and left.

No one had expected such an outcome of this battle, and neither had Qin Yu.

Dean Lei stood up slowly and announced first place in the competition.

Qin Yu, who had obtained first place as he wished, could not be happy. His face was full of melancholy and his heart was full of bitterness.

“This competition has never had a rule on the same cultivation realm. I’m not the winner,” Qin Yu murmured in a low voice.

The cheers of the Demon-slaying Peak’s brothers came from the scene. Only Qin Yu looked incredibly lonely.
