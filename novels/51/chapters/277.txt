Chapter 278: Peak of the Inner Strength Grandmaster Realm Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

After Qin Yu returned to his body, he could clearly feel that the strength of his divine sense was rapidly increasing!

The light that was the size of a grain of rice in his mind instantly increased by a few degrees!

“Could it be that... swallowing the divine sense of others can also increase the strength of my divine sense?” Qin Yu finally understood!

However, this method was a little too cruel.

Once the divine sense was swallowed, it would truly destroy one’s soul!

This was still somewhat difficult for Qin Yu to accept.

“Forget it. When I go back this time, it’s time for me to go into seclusion,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He had gained quite a lot this time. Not only had he swallowed the Earth Fiend Valley’s ancestor, but he had also obtained three sacks of medicinal pills.

More importantly, Qin Yu seemed to have obtained a faster way to increase his strength.

“Ruoxue, perhaps I’ll be able to go to Jingdu to see you soon,” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice, and a smile couldn’t help but appear on his face.

...

The plane sped along.

Halfway through, Xiao Yu finally woke up, but she was still extremely weak.

She rubbed her eyes and said, “Where am I...”

“Xiao Yu, you’re finally awake!” Seeing that Xiao Yu had woken up, Xiao Mi hurriedly shouted.

Xiao Yu glanced at Xiao Mi, but her expression turned cold.

Xiao Mi also felt the change in Xiao Yu’s attitude, so she smiled and said, “Xiao Yu, are you still angry with me? I had no choice in that situation...”

“No choice? Xiao Mi, think about it. How many times have I helped you? When you were bullied, wasn’t it me who stood up for you?” Xiao Yu said angrily.

“I never let you spend money when we go out. I was the one who introduced you to all the people you know.”

“In the end, you betrayed me. Don’t you have a conscience?!”

The more she said, the angrier she got. She simply ignored Xiao Mi.

Xiao Mi was a little flustered. Her family wasn’t as wealthy as Xiao Mi’s.

Without Xiao Mi, she would probably have become an ordinary girl again.

“Qin Yu, I have to thank you. If it weren’t for you, I might have really died there,” Xiao Yu no longer paid attention to Xiao Mi. Instead, she came close to Qin Yu and said in a sweet voice.

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “Don’t mess around in the future. Your father was almost scared to death.”

“Gee, I know. I will definitely listen to him in the future!” Xiao Yu said seriously.

The plane soon landed in Chuzhou.

Mr. Wu’s car had been waiting here for a long time.

As soon as he saw Xiao Yu, he ran over with tears in his eyes.

“Why are you so disobedient? Are you trying to scare me to death?!” Mr. Wu was angry and happy, and he couldn’t help but cry.

Xiao Yu also seemed to feel a little guilty. She said in a low voice, “Dad, I’m sorry. I. . . I didn’t expect this to happen.”

“Actually, this matter isn’t necessarily Xiao Yu’s fault,” Qin Yu suddenly said.

Mr. Wu was stunned and frowned. “Qin Yu, what does this mean?”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “I keep feeling that Xiao Yu’s body seems to be a little special. Maybe it has attracted the Earth Fiend Valley in some way.”

“I remember now. They said that Xiao Yu has a pure dark energy body!” At this moment, Xiao Mi suddenly shouted.

“Pure dark energy body? Then it explains things.” Jiang Gu’s expression changed slightly.

“Do you know about this kind of body?” Qin Yu asked.

Jiang Gu nodded and said, “Pure dark energy body and pure bright energy body are two extremes. The difference is that one cultivates bright energy and the other cultivates dark energy.”

“It’s said that if you use these two kinds of bodies to refine medicine, you can refine a top-grade divine medicine.”

“There is also a rumor that when these two physiques combine, you will be able to increase your strength.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but blush, and Xiao Yu also felt a little awkward.

“Mr. Wu, the Earth Fiend Valley won’t be the last to target Xiao Yu. You better keep an eye on her in the future,” Jiang Gu reminded him.

Mr. Wu hurriedly nodded and said, “I know. I know.”

Then, he suspiciously inquired about Jiang Gu’s identity.

Jiang Gu felt helpless and could only explain the matter.

After sending Xiao Yu away, Qin Yu was ready to go home. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Jiang Gu had just changed his identity and had many things to deal with, so he didn’t go with Qin Yu.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to waste time. After going home, he didn’t even rest and was ready to start breaking through.

After absorbing the strength of the ancestor of the Earth Fiend Valley, Qin Yu was confident that he could directly break through to the seventh level of the Foundation Establishment Stage.

Just as Qin Yu was preparing to enter closed-door cultivation to break through, he suddenly felt an extremely powerful internal qi approaching him!

The strength of this internal qi far exceeded Qin Yu’s imagination!

Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed. From this internal qi, it seemed that the other party was at least an Inner Strength Grandmaster, and there wasn’t just one of them!

Qin Yu hurriedly walked out of his house and looked around coldly.

“Since you’re here, why are you acting so sneaky?” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Your perception is pretty good.”

Three figures walked out from the darkness.

Even though these three had restrained their internal qi, Qin Yu could still clearly sense their terrifying strength!

“Who are you people?” Qin Yu looked at these three people warily.

The other party sneered. “Don’t you know who you’ve offended?”

“I’ve offended many people.” Qin Yu sneered.

“Tsk tsk, it seems that the Hong Yi Sect isn’t worthy of your attention.” The other party said indifferently.

Hong Yi Sect!

He didn’t expect that the people of Hong Yi Sect would come looking for him so quickly!

“Three Inner Strength Grandmasters? You guys really think highly of me.” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said.

“Hahahaha! To be precise... it’s three Inner Strength Grandmasters at the peak!” The other party said indifferently.

Inner Strength Grandmasters at the peak?

Qin Yu’s expression immediately became extremely unsightly!

They were practically the strongest opponents Qin Yu had encountered!

With his current strength, not to mention three Inner Strength Grandmasters at the peak, even if it was just one, Qin Yu wouldn’t be able to deal with it!

“What, are you afraid?” The other party said indifferently.

Qin Yu’s expression was unsightly, but he quickly raised his internal qi to prepare to make a move at any moment.

“Hehe, don’t waste your strength. In front of us, your strength isn’t worth mentioning.” The three of them slowly approached Qin Yu.

“Cut the crap and make your move.” Qin Yu roared furiously, and his internal qi was raised to the limit!

“You’re too brazen.” The three of them coldly said, and a terrifying pressure immediately swept over!

In that instant, Qin Yu felt as if his entire body had been struck by lightning, and even his movements seemed to be suppressed!

It was only the difference of a few stages, but there was such a huge difference in strength!

“You can’t even move, so how are you going to resist?” The three of them said with a cold laugh.

Right at that moment, a figure shot out and blocked in front of Qin Yu!

“Who allowed the Hong Yi Sect to step into Pyro?”
