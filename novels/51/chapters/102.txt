Chapter 103: Celebrity Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu, unable to say a single word, watched Yan Ruoxue nervously.

At this moment, Yan Ruoxue suddenly laid on the bed, then closed her eyes, as if she was at his disposal.

Qin Yu watched Yan Ruoxue, who was lying on the bed, while growing more and more excited.

Yan Ruoxue, not saying anything, also kept her eyes closed.

Qin Yu sat there for a long time. He took a deep breath and said, “Miss Yan, you should rest early. I’m going back to my room.”

This surprised Yan Ruoxue a little. She sat up from the bed and watched Qin Yu. “You... really don’t want to do anything?”

“Yes.” Qin Yu nodded without thinking.

“I’m not good enough for you now. You’ve helped me enough. I hope that I can help you and protect you in the future,” Qin Yu said seriously.

His eyes and tone were filled with determination, making it hard for her to doubt him.

Yan Ruoxue seemed to be very satisfied with Qin Yu’s answer. She nodded and said with a smile, “Go back to sleep.”

Qin Yu turned around and quickly returned to his room. He took a cold shower and finally calmed himself down.

“Phew, I almost couldn’t control myself.” Qin Yu took a long breath.

Then, Qin Yu took out the jade pendant from his pocket and prepared to make an amulet for Yan Ruoxue.

He closed his eyes and felt the inheritance in his mind.

Soon, Qin Yu found an amulet technique named “Form One Dharma Decree” in the inheritance.

This amulet technique was very useful. Not only could it drive away evil spirits and beautify one’s appearance, but it could also save one’s life at a critical moment.

Once one was in a life-threatening situation, the protective talisman would take effect.

The only drawback was that it could only be used once. After one use, the protective talisman would shatter.

“It’s you,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

The Form One Dharma Decree was extremely taxing on Qin Yu. He spent an entire night and dripped fifteen drops of blood essence, but he still couldn’t successfully refine it. He only managed to refine a half-finished product.

“Looks like it will take another night,” Qin Yu said weakly.

The sky gradually brightened up. Qin Yu washed up briefly and walked out of the room.

Yan Ruoxue had already tidied herself up. When she saw Qin Yu, she blinked and said, “There’s an amusement park nearby. Should we go there?”

“Okay.” Although Qin Yu was a little tired, he didn’t want to spoil the mood, so he agreed. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

After the two of them had breakfast, they rushed to the amusement park.

On the other hand, after Liu Shihui returned home, he hurriedly asked someone to investigate Yan Ruoxue’s background.

“Young Master Liu, that girl is the Yan family’s oldest daughter, Yan Ruoxue,” one of his subordinates said to Liu Shihui.

“What?!” Hearing this, Liu Shihui suddenly sat up!

His expression couldn’t help but turn ugly, and he felt a chill run down his back!

“That was close. I almost harmed the entire Liu family...” Liu Shihui felt a lingering sense of fear.

The Shen family’s incident was still vivid in his mind. He had nearly doomed him and the entire Liu family.

“But... that person called Qin Yu doesn’t seem to have any impressive background.” At this moment, his subordinate continued.

Liu Shihui glanced at him to indicate for him to continue.

“According to our investigation, Qin Yu came from Jiangcheng. For some reason, he received Miss Yan’s favor.”

Hearing this, Liu Shihui said somewhat impatiently, “Then aren’t you spouting something pointless?! Miss Yan is his backer. Who would dare to provoke him?!”

“Young Master Liu, I heard that Miss Yan is about to leave Jingdu. When that time comes, we might have a chance.” His subordinate continued.

“Moreover... the people of the Yan family might not take a fancy to Qin Yu.”

Liu Shihui’s eyes lit up.

He couldn’t help but think of what Yan Jiang had said last night.

From Yan Jiang’s tone, it was clear that the Yan family didn’t take a fancy to Qin Yu.

“Then it seems that there’s still a chance,” Yan Jiang narrowed his eyes and thought to himself.

He snorted lightly and said, “After Miss Yan leaves Jingdu, I want to personally go and have a chat with Qin Yu.”

“Yes, Young Master.” His subordinate nodded.

“Oh right, today, we have artists from the company taking photos at the amusement park. Should we go take a look?” His subordinate continued.

Liu Shihui thought for a moment and nodded. “Mm, I just happen to be planning to go out for a walk. Prepare the car.”

...

The amusement park was the largest amusement park in South City.

As a coastal city, South City naturally had many tourists every year.

Once she entered the amusement park, Yan Ruoxue felt like she was a young little princess, and she felt extremely happy and blissful.

In the dark, Yan Jiang watched this scene and couldn’t help but sigh. “I really can’t imagine that the Miss Yan in front of me and the CEO in Jingdu are the same person...”

“Yeah, I’ve never seen Miss Yan smile so happily before.” The others also sighed.

Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue played almost every ride in the amusement park, such as the sledgehammer, roller coaster, haunted house, and so on.

This kind of blissful and warm feeling filled the two of them with pleasure.

“Shall we go to the Ferris wheel to take photos?” At this time, Yan Ruoxue suddenly suggested.

“Sure, I’ve never sat on the Ferris wheel before!” Qin Yu smiled.

Thus, Yan Ruoxue held Qin Yu’s hand and ran all the way to the Ferris wheel.

Just as they bought the tickets, seven to eight bodyguards suddenly rushed over.

“Hurry up and get out of the way. We’re commandeering this place!” The leading bodyguard said with an overbearing wave of his hand.

They saw a beautifully dressed girl surrounded by them. The girl wore sunglasses and her face was covered with a veil.

Beside her was Mr. Bai!

“Why is it them again?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

“Is it Cheng Lei?” At this time, someone by the roadside suddenly asked in a low voice.

Mr. Bai said indifferently, “Yes, it’s Miss Cheng. She wants to film here. Please cooperate.”

“It’s the famous Cheng Lei!”

“Wow, Cheng Lei is here! Miss Cheng Lei, I’m your fan. Can I take a photo with you?!”

“Miss Cheng, I love you!”

Everyone shouted. Someone wanted to take a photo and went forward, but was pushed down by the bodyguard.

“Stay away from Miss Cheng! Don’t take photos. Do you hear me?” Mr. Bai pointed at the people around him and scolded.

“I told you not to take photos. Can’t you hear me?!” Seeing someone holding a cell phone, Mr. Bai walked forward and directly threw the fan’s cell phone on the ground!

The celebrity called Cheng Lei frowned and snorted lightly. “What a bunch of crass people. How annoying!”

“So she’s a celebrity. No wonder she’s so arrogant.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

Yan Ruoxue also snorted lightly. “These minor celebrities are very arrogant now. They think they’re superior just because they have a bit of fame. It’s indeed annoying.”

“Get out of the way quickly. Do you hear me?” The bodyguards dispersed the crowd and said impatiently.

Soon, they arrived in front of Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue.

Mr. Bai frowned and then sneered. “It’s you guys again? What a coincidence.”

“It is quite a coincidence,” Qin Yu said with a cold expression.

This time, Mr. Bai ignored them. He walked to Cheng Lei and whispered a few words.

After Cheng Lei heard this, she walked up to Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue without saying a word.

She said with a dark expression, “Are you guys fans? Are you guys deliberately trying to attract attention like this? How annoying. It’s disgusting to stalk celebrities like this. Don’t you guys know?”

Hearing this, Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue felt a little baffled.

“You think too highly of yourself. I’ve never even heard of an F-list celebrity like you.” Yan Ruoxue rolled her eyes.
