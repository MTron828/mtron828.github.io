Chapter 2547 Xuanji Bright Eyes

“Strange, the coordinates that Martial Uncle’s tablet sensed should be here, but I don’t find anything unusual here.”

The other five used their methods one after another but did not detect anything.

“There should be something strange here, or perhaps some methods have interfered with our investigation.”

Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes and said.

“Brother Qin, what makes you have such a judgment?”

Xuan Xin asked solemnly.

“I left a mark on Titan and the Death Godly King. They are currently stationed not far from us.”

Qin Yu said with a frown. Right now, they needed to use all their strength to resist the enormous dark power in the Misty Forest.

Therefore, they were as bright as the sun now.

On the contrary, the magic power of the various races in the monster territory was their best disguise, and Xuan Xin would find it hard to detect them under such a storm.

Furthermore, Qin Yu’s current holy body had extended from his spine to all parts of his body.

His body seemed to have undergone an exaggerated change as if his every pore could see through everything.

A gentle breeze blew past, and his body would immediately react, and his muscles slightly tense as if he were ready to face threats from all directions at any time.

At this moment, when the dark power blew past his body, he seemed to be able to sense the “shape” of the wind.

Time was as though slowing down around him. He could make the most precise judgments and reactions at the critical moment, whether he should evade, dodge, or confront danger head-on to mitigate threats swiftly.

At this moment, his body had an inexplicable sense of fear akin to an unknown danger hidden here.

In an instant, he was ready to attack with all his might.

Within a few seconds, Qin Yu felt cold sweat seeping out of his back heavily as though he had experienced a great battle.

“Protect me!”

Xuan Tian suddenly closed his eyes, and the surrounding internal qi gradually became solemn.

It then accurately sank onto his forehead, and a layer of sacred light began to appear around his eyes.

At that moment, his pupils became deep and dark, like black holes that led to the boundless universe.

The moment that gaze landed on him, Qin Yu felt his entire body being seen through.

“Delusiveness, shatter!”

As Xuan Xin’s gaze fell on a specific spot, all the subtle forces in the world began to reverse.

Countless illusory images appeared in an instant. They were the various things that had happened before this.

Under the effect of this technique, countless terrifying battle histories began to replay.

The power of space-time backtracking revealed a terrifying scene, tracing back to the past. In this place, one would see dilapidated structures and bloodstained lands. A dark atmosphere enveloped the entire area as if boundless animosity still lingered in the air.

Traces of the battle that once happened could be vaguely seen. Broken swords, shattered shields, and debris littered the ground. The smell of fresh blood was still permeating the air, making people feel the cruelty and terror of endless slaughter.

Countless corpses lay on the ground. The bodies of these living beings had been destroyed beyond recognition by the battle. Their eyes were still filled with fear and despair as if their souls were still wandering in this land of death.

In just an instant, millions of scenes of slaughter flashed across this place.

The bloody and terrifying dark scene made Shen Qian and Shen Rou tremble uncontrollably. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Even though they were cultivators who had experienced countless battles and not flowers grown in a greenhouse, a chill still rose from the bottom of their hearts when faced with this most primitive scene of slaughter.

“What a terrifying pupil technique. What technique is this?”

Qin Yu was somewhat shocked. Being able to deduce the traces of the past from the remaining rules of heaven and earth and restore them was an extremely heaven-defying method.

“This is the Heavenly Divination Sect’s supreme treasure, Xuanji Bright Eyes. It was temporarily loaned to us for this trip. Xuanji symbolizes the universe, and Bright Eyes represents insight. When combined, it describes the clarity and insight of the Daoist Heavenly Eye. It was left behind by Yang Jian, a famous Saint of the Three Purities Sect. It only has such heaven-defying power after being activated.”

Xuan Xin seemed to have noticed Qin Yu being surprised. He explained to Qin Yu with a smile.

However, as these people who took action were stronger, it took more spiritual power to activate Xuanji Bright Eyes.

At this moment, countless blood vessels suddenly covered the Heavenly Eye that appeared on Xuan Tian’s forehead.

All of a sudden, the scenes in the surroundings became chaotic.

The area covered in the vision presented a blurry scene.

A massive shadow seemed to have appeared at the end of the sky in heaven and earth.

Even though it was just a phantom, Qin Yu felt an inexplicable sense of sorrow.

It seems that amid the gaze, an invisible chain appeared to entangle his divine sense.

It was an inescapable despair, a fear of being swallowed by unfathomable darkness.

With the appearance of this figure, Xuan Xin felt as if he was being devoured.

He spat out a mouthful of blood, and his face turned incredibly ashen.

“Martial Uncle Zi Yang, you indeed have been here. Why are you so sorrowful?”

Xuan Tian roared.

That feeling of sorrow seemed to be clearly felt even in the distant era.

The Daoist philosophy emphasized inactions and such emotional fluctuations were rarely seen among cultivators. Especially the more advanced Daoist priests, their state of mind tended to be tranquil and undisturbed.

At Saint Zi Yang’s level, even if the world were to collapse, he would not reveal a single trace of emotion.

Xuan Tian was thus so shocked. What had made Saint Zi Yang’s state of mind collapse?

As soon as Xuan Tian came into contact with this scene, the entire Misty Forest began to flash with lightning and thunder.

It was as though all the disguises had retreated, and the original terrifying scenes had been restored.

Countless distorted vortexes suddenly appeared in the sky, and the entire Misty Forest began to tremble. A depressing and terrifying atmosphere filled the air.

Under the terrifying dark storm, the surrounding scenery began to distort. The trees withered, and the ground cracked as if the end of the world had arrived.

Dark clouds covered the sky, and black lightning wreaked havoc within, letting out terrifying roars.

Countless dark storms crashed onto them like giant dragons. Shen Qian, Shen Rou, Zhang Xiang, and Li Yang were blown so hard that they could not stand firm.

Every gust of wind that attacked the bodies was equivalent to the strength of the Tribulation Fourth Level hitting their bodies.
