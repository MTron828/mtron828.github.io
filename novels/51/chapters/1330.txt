Chapter 1331: Chapter 1,331, the terrifying right fist 

After the two of them left, ah San could not help but ask, “Miss Wan ‘er, have you ever thought that we would offend Ling Yun and even the Tianyun Sect?”

“With our Zhao family’s ability, we are definitely not a match for the Tianyun sect. Is it worth it to do this for Qin Yu?”

Wan ‘er smiled and said, “This matter has nothing to do with the family. If the Tianyun sect really wants to settle the score, I will look for them to clarify it.”

“What About You?”Ah San hurriedly asked, “Don’t tell me you want to sacrifice your life for that Qin Yu?”

Wan ‘er shook her head and said, “I have already thought it through. I want to leave the Zhao family, go to the western ridge, or the Thunder Academy.”

“These few years have allowed me to see clearly the members of the Zhao family. I don’t want to stay there for a long time.”

To Wan ‘er, the Zhao family had become a sad place.

The place where she was born had brought her endless rolling eyes.

This was the holy region, a place that only respected strength.

“Miss Wan ‘er, you... you really want to leave the Zhao Family?”Ah San said in a trembling voice, his eyes somewhat sad.

Wan ‘er hummed in gratitude and said, “I’ve already thought about it. Before I recover my spiritual power, I’ve thought about it countless times.”

“What About Me?”Ah San’s face was full of pain.

Wan ‘er smiled and said, “You should continue to stay in the Zhao family.”

“I... I want to stay by your side...”Ah San looked even sadder.

Wan ‘er shook her head and said, “Silly, you should know that it’s impossible between us. I’ve always treated you as a friend, a very good friend.”

Ah San was even more disappointed. He stood there at a loss.

He wanted to follow Wan ‘er, even if he knew that there would be no result.

With Wan ‘ER’s talent, it would not be a problem for her to join any sect, including the famous Thunder Academy.

However, ah San could not. He did not have the qualifications.

...

In the room, Qin Yu was closing his eyes slightly.

In his hand was the spirit refining clothes.

This was a magic tool that could protect the primordial spirit. Rumor has it that it could protect a full-strength attack.

Qin Yu’s physical body could be said to be unparalleled. Almost no one in the mighty realm could break through his defense.

However, the primordial spirit couldn’t. If someone used the primordial spirit spell, then Qin Yu would definitely die.

“The soul-refining clothes... I’m counting on you,”Qin Yu said to himself.

He planned to use these three days to refine the soul-refining clothes to prevent Ling Yun from using the primordial spirit spell.

Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly. Threads of light floated out from between his brows and slowly condensed into Qin Yu’s appearance.

At this moment, a small golden figure was Qin Yu’s primordial spirit. At this moment, it was flickering with a faint light in the darkness.

The small golden figure slowly walked towards the spirit refinement clothes. He landed on the spirit refinement clothes and began to fuse with the spirit refinement clothes.

The spirit refinement clothes’devouring was extremely simple. To put it bluntly, it was to put a layer of armor on the primordial spirit.

This layer of armor was attached to the primordial spirit and could protect one’s life at a critical level.

The soul refining robe slowly fused with the primordial spirit before finally sticking to the primordial spirit.

At this moment, the news of Qin Yu and Ling Yun’s battle had already spread nearby.

Many people from Yang City and the vicinity of Yang City had rushed over to watch the battle.

“Young Master Ling, many people want to witness the battle between the two of you,”the attendant said in a deep voice.

“Battle?”Ling Yun couldn’t help but sneer. “Can it be considered a battle between him and me? I’m here to kill him, that’s all.”

The attendant hurriedly bowed and said, “I’m sorry, I said something wrong.”

Ling Yun didn’t say anything else. He stood on top of the tall building with his hands behind his back, silently gazing at Yang City.

His residence was on the side of the river.

Standing in front of the window, he could see the western ridge on the opposite side.

“The western ridge... an entire Lizhou is actually divided into five sections,”Ling Yun said in a low voice as he narrowed his eyes.

The attendant bowed and said, “Speaking of which, it’s all because of this great river in front of us. If it wasn’t for this great river, sect master would definitely have been able to enter the western ridge back then and bring the western ridge into our territory.”

“Oh?”Ling Yun raised his eyebrows.

He recalled his master’s words.

First Elder said that Qin Yu had no way of escaping to the western ridge because of the river in front of him.

“What is the origin of this river?”Ling Yun asked. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The attendant bowed and said, “I’m not sure either. In short, sect master used many methods back then but was unable to cross this river.”

“Regardless of whether it’s humans, birds, or beasts, none of them were able to fly above this river. Furthermore, the cost of using a teleportation formation was too high. In the end, they could only give up.”

Ling Yun snorted coldly. “When I become the sect leader, I will definitely flatten the western ridge and turn the entire Li Zhou into My Tianyun sect’s territory!”

The attendant didn’t say anything, but there was a hint of ridicule in his heart.

Who was the sect leader of Tianyun sect? Something that even he couldn’t do, let alone Ling Yun.

...

Time flew by. In the blink of an eye, two days had passed.

And Qin Yu had finally succeeded in swallowing the spirit-refining clothes.

The wisps of primordial spirit returned to his original body.

Qin Yu slowly opened his eyes and said in a low voice, “This spirit-refining clothes... I don’t feel anything.”

He originally thought that the spirit-refining clothes would make Qin Yu feel a little uncomfortable, but now, he didn’t feel the slightest bit of fighting.

“That’s good too,”Qin Yu stood up and said.

“In that case, I have nothing to worry about.”

If Ling Yun didn’t use the disk vision, even Qin Yu’s defense wouldn’t be able to break through.

Another Day passed.

The day of the battle with Ling Yun was already near.

That night, wan ‘er and Ah San came to Qin Yu’s room.

“Young Master Qin, the injury on your hand...”Wan ‘er asked tentatively.

Qin Yu pulled off the gauze on his hand. A faint dark golden glow could be seen flickering on his hand.

Although there were still some injuries, the effect was not great.

“There’s no problem.”Qin Yu lightly clenched his fist and said coldly.

“That’s good.”Wan ‘er smiled.

Ah San muttered, “Qin Yu, I’ve never been able to figure it out. Why did you break your right hand?”

Qin Yu glanced at him and said with a smile, “Look at these two hands. Are there any changes?”

Ah San looked at them carefully and said, “The color seems to have changed a little, but... What’s the use?”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “I can’t explain it to you. You just need to know that this fist is several times stronger than before.”

“Hehe, Qin Yu, it’s not that I don’t believe it. It’s just that this is too ridiculous.”Ah San waved his hand and said.

“You can become stronger by breaking your own hand? I’ve never heard of such a cultivation method.”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said half-jokingly and half-seriously, “Do you want to try?”

Ah San also rubbed his fist and said, “I really have the intention.”
