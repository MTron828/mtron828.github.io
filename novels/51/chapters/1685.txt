Chapter 1686: Chapter 1,686, Xiao Sheng’s conceit 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

A complicated expression flashed across Qin Yu’s face.

This Xiao Sheng seemed to know everything, and all of this was because of his guess.

“The curse of the east barren will take my life,”Qin Yu took a deep breath and said coldly.

Xiao Sheng put his hands behind his back and said, “Any curse can be dissolved.”

“How?”Qin Yu quickly asked.

“I don’t know,”Xiao Sheng said without hesitation.

Qin Yu was instantly speechless.

“But I believe you can do it,”Xiao Sheng said.

“With your strength, you will be torn to pieces in the East Wilderness, but you survived. I believe you have luck.”

“Moreover, I told you that the luck of the East Wilderness will soon return. At that time, you will still have to go to the East Wilderness. This time, you came out alive, which means you can stand in the East Wilderness.”

It had to be said that what Xiao Sheng said seemed to make some sense.

For Qin Yu, to be able to increase his strength as soon as possible, everything was worth it.

He originally wanted to ask Xiao Sheng about it, but now Qin Yu no longer had that kind of thought.

“Did you gain anything in the East Continent?”At this time, Xiao Sheng suddenly asked.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment. In the end, he did not tell Xiao Sheng about the dragon eyes. He only took out a jar of dragon blood and gave it to Xiao Sheng.

“This is dragon blood. I’ll give it to you,”Qin Yu said.

Xiao Sheng could not help but be surprised when he heard this.

“Dragon Blood? You encountered the Dragon Burial Cave?”Xiao Sheng said in surprise.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I got some dragon blood by luck.”

“You really are a person with great luck,”Xiao Sheng said with a sigh.

He glanced at the dragon blood and said, “Then I won’t stand on ceremony.”

Qin Yu acknowledged. He stood up and was about to leave. At this moment, he seemed to have thought of something.

“I remember that the heavenly cloud sect seems to have a teleportation array platform. Why has the Heavenly Cloud sect never activated it?”? “If this array platform had been activated back then, I believe that senior Xiao Hai would not have died. He might even have been able to kill him before the elementalists recovered,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Xiao Sheng shook his head and said, “That array platform is not perfect. It is simply impossible to teleport people to other locations.”

“That’s not right, right?”Qin Yu frowned.

“Back then, I came to the Holy Region through your Tianyun sect’s array platform.”

Xiao Sheng smiled faintly and said, “That is not the effect of the Tianyun sect’s array platform. It is the effect of your local array platform.”

“The Tianyun sect’s array platform is just a medium, a receiving point.”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Then how did you rely on this array platform back then on Earth?”

“It’s still because of your local array platform,”Xiao Sheng said.

“That’s an open array platform. If it wasn’t for your Northern Land’s array platform, we wouldn’t have been able to go.”

“In other words, we wouldn’t be able to rely on this single array platform to teleport, so naturally, we wouldn’t be able to go to the northern lands.”

Qin Yu thought about it, and it seemed to make sense.

A true array platform could teleport people to any location at any time, and there was no need for another array platform to accept it.

Just like the northern lands, their formation could come to the southern region at any time, and they could also return at any time.

“I need dark energy,”Qin Yu said at this moment.

“Find me a place. Think of it as you returning my dragon blood favor.”

Xiao Sheng nodded. He raised his finger and lightly dotted the air.

A few minutes later, a coordinate lit up in front of Qin Yu.

Qin Yu looked at the coordinate and asked, “Is this place safe?”

“It’s safe.”Xiao Sheng’s answer was concise.

“Okay, thank you.”Qin Yu nodded and turned around to leave.

After taking less than two steps, Qin Yu stopped again and turned to look at Xiao Sheng.

“What realm are you at exactly? Have you stepped into the reversion void stage?”Qin Yu frowned and asked.

Xiao Sheng shook his head without hesitation and said, “I’m only half a step into the reversion void stage.”

Upon hearing this, Qin Yu turned pale with fright!

He did not expect that Xiao Sheng had not stepped into the reversion void stage at all!

How could a half-step to the reversion void stage deal with an elementalist? VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“I always thought that you had stepped into the reversion void stage long ago.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

Xiao Sheng placed his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “As I said before, cultivation requires an opportunity and a dao technique. Before the world has changed, our southern region no longer has the conditions to step into the reversion void stage.”

“This is also the reason why I left the Cultivation Mountain and traveled the world.”

Qin Yu understood.

Before the arrival of the great era, the luck of the southern region was not enough to support the birth of a reversion void stage cultivator, no matter how talented one was. ..

“This is the reason why many people have broken through recently, right?”Qin Yu understood.

Xiao Sheng nodded slightly and said, “That’s right. I’ll tell you another terrifying thing.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything, waiting for Xiao Sheng’s follow-up.

“Back then, when my declining Heavenly Cloud sect conquered the southern region, we killed countless people and offended countless people. Many people, like nine holes, chose to go into seclusion. There were also people who died at my hands.”

“And other than them, there were also some experts who chose to temporarily hide and not compete with the Heavenly Cloud Sect.”

“As for them, a large portion of them were at the peak of the mighty figure stage or even half-step to the reversion void stage.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said, “Now that the great era has arrived, their seclusion can be considered to have received some rewards.”

“That’s not what I want to say.”Xiao Sheng shook his head.

“Among these people, a large portion of them are much older than me, and they have cultivated for an extremely long time. Those who can reach this stage are all extremely talented. The only thing they are lacking from stepping into the reversion void stage is the luck between heaven and Earth.”

“But they know clearly in their hearts that before entering the reversion void stage, no one is my match.”

“Now that the world has changed, these people will very likely take the opportunity to enter the reversion void stage.”

Qin Yu did not say a word, but he already understood Xiao Sheng’s meaning.

“Before they enter the reversion void stage, they would not dare to compete with you. But once they enter the reversion void stage, they will definitely reappear. The first person they will look for should also be you. After all, you are a mountain in the southern region that no one can climb over,”Qin Yu said.

Xiao Sheng put his hands behind his back and nodded. “That’s right. If it wasn’t for Xiao Hai being soft-hearted back then, they would have died long ago.”

Qin Yu said half-jokingly and half-seriously, “Then are you afraid? If they were the first to enter the reversion void stage, wouldn’t you die at their hands?”

Speaking up to this point, Qin Yu thought of the divine capital and continued, “Why don’t you go to the divine capital and enter closed-door cultivation? Once you enter the reversion void stage, don’t leave even half a step.”

Hearing this, Xiao Sheng’s long and narrow eyes flashed with a trace of playfulness.

He said indifferently, “When did I say that I was afraid of the reversion void stage?”

Qin Yu was startled and said with a frown, “You should understand the difference between the reversion void stage and the half-step reversion void stage better than me. This is the difference between heaven and Earth.”
