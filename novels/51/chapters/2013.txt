2014 Met Xiao Hai in Divine Fortuity City

The overbearing internal qi on Elder Si’s body made the surrounding people step back voluntarily.

In Divine Fortuity City, killing and robbing were not rare, even for the various aristocratic families.

Qin Yu touched his chin and could not help but feel a little strange.

Three billion wasn’t a big amount for the Si family. Elder Si had no reason to tarnish the reputation of the entire aristocratic family for such a small amount of spirit coins.

“Just what is this Elder Si thinking…” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Looking at Elder Si, even though the shop owner was unwilling, he hesitated.

The Si family was too huge. If he went against such an aristocratic family, he would definitely suffer in the future.

The shopkeeper took a deep breath. Just as he was about to agree, a voice suddenly sounded by the side.

“I’m willing to pay three billion for this item.” This voice was tremendously loud and clear, instantly attracting the attention of numerous people.

When Qin Yu heard this voice, his body trembled!

It was because this hearty and righteous voice was too familiar!

“Xiao… Xiao Hai!” Qin Yu was instantly incredibly excited!

Looking at this man who looked exactly like Xiao Sheng, Qin Yu could not help but feel excited!

He did not expect Xiao Hai to appear in Divine Fortuity City! He even publicly challenged Elder Si! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The abrupt change made everyone look at Xiao Hai. Elder Si’s eyes were even more sinister and terrifying!

“Do you know who I am?” Elder Si said coldly.

Xiao Hai stepped forward. “I don’t care who you are, but you can’t buy or sell by force. I like this item. If you don’t want to pay, I’m willing to pay three billion for it.”

“Are you courting death?” Elder Si flew into a rage, and the internal qi on his body erupted to the extreme!

Xiao Hai didn’t show any fear on his face. He even ignored Elder Si. He instead walked up to the shop owner and said, “Three billion. I’ll buy it.”

“This…” Although the shop owner was willing to sell it to Xiao Hai, he didn’t dare to offend Elder Si.

Xiao Hai patted the shop owner’s shoulder and said, “Don’t be afraid. If he wants to find trouble, he should look for me.”

“I think you’re tired of living!” Elder Si shouted. He waved his sleeve, and his palm rapidly approached Xiao Hai directly!

Xiao Hai was not afraid at all. He snorted coldly and immediately raised his palm to receive the attack!

“Boom!”

With a loud bang, a terrifying internal qi instantly swept in all directions!

Xiao Hai immediately raised his other hand to protect everyone!

Elder Ji stumbled back a few steps before he managed to stabilize himself!

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu was incomparably excited!

Xiao Hai was still the same Xiao Hai. Not only did he have unimaginable strength, but he also had a tremendously kind and righteous heart!

“If you want to attack, I will accompany you,” Xiao Hai said coldly.

Elder Si’s expression was incomparably ugly. He knew he was no match for the burly man opposite him, so he could only suppress his anger.

“Do you know I’m from the Si family?” Elder Si said coldly.

“I’ve told you,” Xiao Hai replied without changing his expression. “No matter who you are, you can’t force anyone to buy or sell. The same goes with the Si family.”

“How arrogant!” Elder Si shouted. “Do you know the consequences of offending my Si family?”

“That I really don’t know,” Xiao Hai said calmly.

Elder Si sneered and said, “The last person who offended our Si family is now unknown if he’s dead or alive. He doesn’t even dare to show his face. Have you considered the consequences?”

“Are you talking about Qin Yu?” Xiao Hai laughed.

“It seems you’ve heard of it,” Elder Si said with narrowed eyes.

“Qin Yu is my friend. I also believe he won’t fall so easily,” Xiao Hai said.

Qin Yu, who was standing in the dark, was incredibly excited. Tears welled up in his eyes!

“Alright, kid,” Elder Ji said coldly. “I’ll remember you. The Si family won’t let you off!”

After saying this, Elder Si turned around and left.

After he walked far away, the people in the surroundings immediately cheered.

They looked up at Xiao Hai as if they were looking at a hero, and the respect in their eyes could not be concealed.

Xiao Hai’s uprightness was worthy of everyone’s respect, and so was Qin Yu.

He took out his card and transferred three billion to the shop owner.

“Sell this to me. I’m afraid it’s not safe to keep it in your hands,” Xiao Hai said.

The shop owner nodded repeatedly. He bowed to Xiao Hai and said, “Hero, thank you for your help!”

Xiao Hai waved his hand and turned to leave.

Qin Yu looked at Xiao Hai’s back. He hesitated for a while before finally chasing after him.

“Brother, please wait.” Qin Yu ran up to Xiao Hai and blocked his path.

Xiao Hai glanced at Qin Yu and smiled. “Is there anything?”

“Brother, did you come to Divine Fortuity City for the matter of the Chaos Grave?” Qin Yu asked.

Xiao Hai laughed heartily. “The Chaos Grave. That’s right. I’m indeed quite interested. However, that’s not why I came to Divine Fortuity City.”

...

“Oh? What’s the reason then?” Qin Yu said in surprise.

“It’s a long story,” Xiao Hai sighed and said.

“Brother, if you don’t mind, we can talk in detail in the tavern next door,” Qin Yu bowed and said.

Xiao Hai was a straightforward person. He waved his hand and said, “Okay!”

Thus the two came to the tavern together.

After sitting down, Xiao Hai ordered three large pots of wine. As he was drinking, he told Qin Yu his purpose for coming to Divine Fortuity City.

Through Xiao Hai’s narration, Qin Yu learned that Xiao Hai was not like Xiao Sheng, who wholeheartedly pursued the dao. Instead, he had been traveling around and been to most places in the Holy Region.

He had come to Divine Fortuity City this time to seek a magical artifact called the Ten Thousand Feet Umbrella.

The umbrella was not rare, but the conditions to forge it were relatively harsh. Thus he could only come to Divine Fortuity City to look for it.

“Why don’t you go to the Artifact Refining Guild?” Qin Yu asked.

“I’ve been there, but unfortunately, I couldn’t meet them,” Xiao Hai shook his head and said.

...

Qin Yu came to a sudden realization. Thinking about it, it made sense. This Artifact Refining Guild should be similar to the Alchemist Association. Ordinary people were not qualified to see them at all.

“Brother, you’ve offended the elder of the Si family. Aren’t you afraid of their revenge?” Qin Yu asked tentatively.

Xiao Hai smiled and said, “I’m not afraid. If I die in battle, it’s my fate. Moreover, that old man just now is probably not my match.”

Qin Yu was silent. He tried to sense Xiao Hai’s strength but realized he could not see through it.

“Speaking of which, when will the Chaos Grave open?” Xiao Hai suddenly asked.

Qin Yu was stunned. He did not answer this question. Instead, he shook his head and said, “Brother, you shouldn’t go. If you go to the Chaos Grave, you’ll definitely run into the people of the Si family. By then, it’ll be too late to run away.”
