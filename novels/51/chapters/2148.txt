2149 Dean Lei Battles Si Liuhe

Facing Si Liuhe’s threat, Dean Lei did not back down. He glared at Si Liuhe and shouted, “Do you think I’m joking with you? With me here today, who would dare to touch Qin Yu?”

“Dean Lei, did you see the situation today?” Si Liuhe asked coldly. “All the aristocratic families wanted to get rid of Qin Yu, and even the Yan family’s Holy Lord is here! Don’t be stubborn!”

“D*mn! I’ve said it, and I don’t care so much. You guys can attack together!” Dean Lei said with widened eyes.

“Dean Lei, Si Liuhe is right. Qin Yu kidnapped our Yan family’s saintess.” At this moment, Yan Tianshi spoke.

After all, Yan Tianshi was the Yan family’s Holy Lord. No one else could compare to him in terms of strength or status.

Now that Yan Tianshi had personally spoken, this matter seemed to have become even more troublesome.

Everyone looked at Dean Lei, waiting for his response.

Looking at Yan Tianshi, Dean Lei sneered and said, “Yan Tianshi, as the Holy Lord of the Yan family, you only care about immediate benefits and ignore the long-term. You disregard the genuine feelings of others and forcibly separate a couple, and now you dare to boast shamelessly here?”

Dean Lei’s words shocked everyone!

They did not expect Dean Lei not to show respect to Yan Tianshi. He even mocked him in front of the True Saints in the world!

Yan Tianshi was displeased. He placed his hands behind his back and said coldly, “That’s the matter of the Yan family, so there’s no need for you to worry about it. If you dare to stop me today, I can only send you off in advance.”

“You’re talking so big!” Dean Lei sneered and said. “Do you think that just because your name is Yan Tianshi, you’re really qualified to be compared to Immortal Emperor Tianming? It was still uncertain who would live or die today!”

Si Liuhe stepped forward and said coldly, “The dean of Thunder Courtyard has defied the laws of nature and forcefully obstructed matters. Today, we will enforce justice on behalf of the heavens!”

After a loud shout, all the True Saints present were restless.

They were originally from the nine great aristocratic families and could be considered a community of shared interests. Moreover, with the Traceless Immortal Scripture on Qin Yu and Yan Tianshi’s support, it was naturally clear at a glance how these True Saints would make their choices.

“Just you guys?” Dean Lei sneered and said.

As soon as he finished speaking, an incomparably incredible power suddenly erupted from Dean Lei’s body. This power was so formidable that it made people tremble and unable to look straight at it. It was a king’s internal qi emanating from the depths of the heart. It shot straight into the sky as if it wanted to crush the entire world.

Everyone was shocked. Even the True Saints’ eyes shimmered, revealing a look of astonishment.

Streaks of lightning instantly appeared around Dean Lei’s body. These lightning bolts seemed to be his protector as they rushed out and formed a lightning barrier that enveloped his entire body.

At that moment, Dean Lei was like a god of thunder descending to the mortal world, incomparably mighty and powerful.

“If you want to touch Qin Yu, ask for my permission first,” Dean Lei glared at those True Saints and said unyieldingly.

Such a terrifying internal qi made everyone gasp involuntarily.

They looked at Dean Lei, who was like a god of thunder descending and could not help but feel a sense of fear in their hearts.

“As expected of Dean Lei, you indeed live up to your reputation,” Si Liuhe said coldly.

“But if you don’t retreat today, you must die here!”

With Si Liuhe’s words, confidence surged among the True Saints.

Si Liuhe was the first to move forward. He raised his hand and unleashed a killing technique. Endless dao techniques gathered in his palm, and a terrifying Holy Power instantly swept across the entire Astral Mountain!

For a moment, the entire world seemed to be trembling. The Holy Power that was like a mountain and sea made countless living beings at the bottom of the Astral Mountain feel incomparable fear.

That was an absolute power beyond their imagination.

Under this power, everyone was speechless. They felt an incomparable pressure as if the entire world had frozen at this moment.

Looking at Si Liuhe, Dean Lei’s eyes flashed with indifference. He waved his hand, and countless thunderbolts gathered, directly clashing with the boundless Holy Power head-on.

Boom!

With a loud bang, the lightning and the Holy Power collided in the air, instantly erupting a dazzling light. At this moment, the entire Astral Mountain was drowned by this light.

After that, everyone saw a shocking scene.

The boundless Holy Power disintegrated bit by bit under the collision of the thunderbolts. However, Dean Lei’s thunderbolts were still full of power and directly scattered the Holy Power.

Everyone was shocked and did not expect Dean Lei to be so powerful. He could even fight back against Si Liuhe’s Holy Power.

Although it was just a simple probe, Dean Lei’s terrifying strength was still carved in everyone’s hearts.

Si Liuhe stood high in the sky, his eyes cold and indifferent. But he knew that Dean Lei’s power was not simple.

Si Liuhe stopped smiling, and his eyes turned sharp. He took a deep breath and muttered an ancient incantation. As his voice fell, a deep darkness suddenly appeared around his body as if even the light was swallowed.

He waved his finger gently in the air, and a dark crack suddenly split open before him like a bottomless black hole.

“Dean Lei, try this move of mine,” Si Liuhe said coldly.

“Do you think I’m afraid of you?” Dean Lei sneered and said. What kind of bullsh*t technique is this? I’ll shatter all of it for you today!”

Although he said that, Dean Lei knew this technique was not simple.

Si Liuhe was once a chosen one, and his techniques were unimaginably terrifying!

Although Dean Lei’s cultivation realm was higher than Si Liuhe’s, no one could say who would win this battle.

After he finished speaking, he suddenly stepped forward. The black hole in his hand instantly expanded, and a black beam of light instantly shot out, heading straight for Dean Lei.

Wherever the beam of light passed, the air seemed to have cut apart, emitting an ear-piercing screech.

” Hmph!” Dean Lei snorted coldly. The lightning energy in his hand surged wildly, forming a lightning barrier that collided with the black beam.

Rumble…

In an instant, a terrifying power erupted. The lightning and the black beam collided in the air, emitting an intense light illuminating the entire Astral Mountain.

Dust flew into the air, rocks shattered, and the ground shook at this moment!

The surrounding mountains seemed to tremble under this terrifying power. Large patches of trees seemed to be swept up by huge waves, uprooted, and flew into the sky!

The originally peaceful scene of Astral Mountain completely dissipated at this moment. What replaced it was a destructive power. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience
