2151 Dean Lei’s Madness

In an instant, the entire Astral Mountain seemed to have been enveloped by a layer of light mist. Within that light mist, various faint and elusive images flashed. Some resembled giant beasts rolling, others resembled phoenixes dancing, and some resembled divine beasts roaring, all awe-inspiring!

However, this was only the prologue.

As the True Saint made their moves, the entire world seemed to tremble!

Around Astral Mountain, numerous mountain rocks were shattered in the face of this indescribable aura!

At this moment, the ancient trees of tens of thousands of years were stripped of bark, their branches and leaves scattered as if they were wailing.

This indescribable power directly tore apart the ground, and numerous cracks appeared.

Those cracks were like dragons moving wildly on the ground and spread deep into it, bottomless!

Not only the ground but even the sky was not spared. Those cloud layers were like paper, in the face of this immense power, torn apart bit by bit and transformed into countless fragments that scattered with the wind!

At this moment, the countless stars seemed to have lost their light. They dimmed one by one and disappeared into the sky!

Even the void could not withstand this terrifying power. Cracks spread wildly in the void as if tearing the world into pieces!

Dean Lei was fighting against ten people alone, and countless terrifying internal qi almost destroyed the dao technique! His slightly aged body made people’s hearts ache when seeing him!

The more they fought, the more shocked everyone became. They clearly did not expect Dean Lei to be so powerful!

“Dean Lei, although you are strong, you will definitely die without a doubt today!” a True Saint shouted and immediately unleashed his trump card. He was determined to kill Dean Lei!

The rest of the True Saints attacked one after another. Under Si Liuhe’s lead, Dean Lei was soon at a disadvantage.

Regardless of Dean Lei’s strength, he could not resist ten or so True Saints. He kept retreating, and his physical body began to suffer damage. Bloody holes appeared on his body one after another!

“Dean Lei…!” Qin Yu was in unbearable pain. He could only watch helplessly as Dean Lei fell into a bitter battle, yet he was powerless to do anything.

“Boom!”

Another extremely terrifying light shot over. Dean Lei was directly shaken back and pushed away forcibly, and a few of his bones broke.

Even so, Dean Lei had no intention of retreating. He struggled to get up and adjusted the internal qi in his body with all his might, intending to activate his secret technique!

Despite facing such a difficult situation, Dean Lei did not have the slightest intention of backing down. He gritted his teeth and struggled, his eyes looking straight ahead as if he was announcing to everyone that even though he was already severely injured, he would not give in easily.

“Dean Lei, it’s time for you to see the reality. Today, you will have no way to survive,” Si Liuhe said coldly.

“Even if I die, I’ll take a few of you with me!” Dean Lei laughed loudly and said.

After saying that, the internal qi on his body suddenly erupted. In an instant, dark clouds covered the sky, and lightning rolled. The dao technique was like a stream that gathered toward Dean Lei’s body!

It was an incredibly terrifying secret technique inherited from Immortal Emperor Lei. It was called the Primordial Void Sacred Thunder Technique. This technique was one of Immortal Emperor Lei’s most powerful techniques. It was extremely tough to comprehend it. However, Dean Lei had unleashed this technique!

“It’s the Primordial Void Sacred Thunder Technique…” Si Liuhe was the first to recognize this technique, and a hint of solemness appeared on his face.

The rest of True Saints were even more terrified. They all took out their magical artifacts to protect themselves, as they were afraid to be killed by this technique.

“Buzz!”

A terrifying buzzing sound rang out as the lightning in the sky gathered in Dean Lei’s palm, forming three golden lotus-like thunderlights.

These thunderlights emitted an incredibly terrifying destructive power. The continuous crackling sound emanating from them raised one’s alertness.

The three thunderlights kept spinning, and the speed at which they spun became increasingly faster. In the end, they turned into violent electric currents that kept swirling around Dean Lei wildly!

The entire world seemed to have fallen into silence. Only the whistling of the three thunderlights echoed at this moment.

The three thunderlights of golden lotus on Dean Lei’s body spun wildly as if they were devouring all light, all colors, and all life! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

In the meantime, the internal qi of the thunderlights grew even more violent and dense as if it wanted to devour the entire world!

The sky began to shatter, clouds tore into pieces, and the stars lost their light. It was as if the three thunderlights of golden lotus had absorbed all the colors, leaving only a grayish white.

The crack was like the mouth of a demon devouring the sky. The void seemed to have torn apart wildly, and deep cracks spread wide as if they wanted to tear the entire world into pieces!

The ground was also distorted in the face of this power. Cracks like black dragons moved wildly on it and spread deep into the depths, bottomless.

Mountain rocks shattered, ancient trees toppled, and countless lives were destroyed. Everything seemed to have halted at this moment, and only the violent lightning twisted wildly like a roaring beast. It was shocking.

All living things were in sorrow. The dao technique seemed to have collapsed at this moment. The light of the three thunderlights of the golden lotus became even more dazzling, like three small suns. Each time they spun, they would bring up a whirlwind of lightning. The whirlwind was like a sword, cutting into deep marks in the void.

Such a terrifying scene made everyone feel uneasy. That terrifying power kept surging, and some people could not even withstand this power!

“Crack!”

At this moment, a crisp sound rang out. A True Saint’s protective magical artifact shattered!

“What?!” Everyone was instantly terrified!

Just the residual power of the technique could shatter their magical artifacts. How terrifying would this technique be once it was unleashed?

“As expected of the dean of Thunder Courtyard.” Even Yan Tianshi, who was standing not far away, looked solemn.

He adjusted his internal qi to protect his body. He seemed afraid that untoward incidents would happen under this terrifying technique.

“Everyone, don’t be afraid. If we attack together, he’ll definitely die,” Si Liuhe said coldly.

He opened his mouth and spat out a mark. This mark was like an ancient bell that grew increasingly bigger, protecting everyone.

At this moment, Dean Lei suddenly raised his head. His eye expression was as stormy as lightning. He suddenly shouted, “Come on! Today I will let you witness the true power of Thunder Courtyard!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his body suddenly rushed forward. The three thunderlights of golden lotus followed suit. In an instant, the entire world seemed to have exploded. The sky collapsed, the earth cracked, the void shattered, and the dao technique was destroyed!
