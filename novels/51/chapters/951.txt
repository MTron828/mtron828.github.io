Chapter 952: Chapter 952 will allow you to step into the Martial Saint Realm

Qin Yu was instantly delighted.

This meant that this spiritual sense was at least at the Almighty Realm?

Qin Yu opened his mouth and was about to ask a question, but he suddenly felt something strange outside.

He hurriedly withdrew his spiritual sense and returned to his original body.

He saw Gu Xinghe walking in with a gloomy expression.

His expression was extremely unsightly, and his gaze when he looked at Qin Yu was filled with a sharp killing intent.

“Qin Yu, do you want to live or not?”Gu Xinghe said coldly.

Qin Yu sneered, “F * ck you. If you have something to say, quickly say it.”

Gu Xinghe took a deep breath and said, “Where is Yan Ruoxue? As long as you tell me, I can spare your life.”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and sneered, “Even if I tell you, you won’t be able to find her.”

“It has nothing to do with you. You just need to tell me where she is,”Gu Xinghe said coldly.

Qin Yu wanted to tell him about the secret realm of the Yan family, but he didn’t know if he could tell him about it, so he shut his mouth.

“Tell me, where is Yan Ruoxue?”Gu Xinghe shouted.

“I don’t know,”Qin Yu sneered.

Gu Xinghe gritted his teeth. He grabbed the bars of the prison with both hands and said through gritted teeth, “Qin Yu, do you really want to die?”

“I don’t want to die. It’s good to be alive. As for you, I saw the Word ‘Die’written on your head. You have to be careful,”Qin Yu mocked.

Gu Xinghe was about to get angry when his phone suddenly rang.

He picked up the phone and saw that the caller was a higher-up.

Gu Xinghe was overjoyed!

He was about to go to the higher-ups, but the higher-ups called.

Therefore, Gu Xinghe couldn’t care less about Qin Yu and rushed to the office.

He arrived at the office and as soon as he entered, Gu Xinghe said impatiently, “Dear higher-ups, I have something important to report.”

“Speak,”a higher-up said.

“We caught Qin Yu and found the secret on him!”Gu Xinghe said excitedly.

Then, Gu Xinghe told the higher-ups everything that happened to Yan Jinyao.

After the higher-ups heard it, they fell into silence.

After a while, one of the higher-ups sighed, “We already knew about the bloodline connection between Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue, but we didn’t expect that their bloodlines could work on a third person in this way...”

“What a pity, what a pity,”another higher-up sighed.

“If only we could have discovered it earlier...”

“80% of the Bloodlines, I’m afraid no one else can reach this level except for Yan Jinyao.”

Gu Xinghe said anxiously, “Dear higher-ups, we still have time. As long as we can find Yan Ruoxue’s location from Qin Yu, we can continue the experiment!”

The higher-ups sighed and said, “It’s impossible for us to find Yan Ruoxue. Even if we do, it’s not something we can touch.”

“What do you mean?”Gu Xinghe was extremely puzzled.

“Could it be that there’s someone more powerful than the Lords?”

The higher-ups said in a low voice, “What you see is just this small space. The real world is much bigger than you think. There are many people who are stronger than us.”

Gu Xinghe opened his mouth and wanted to ask something, but the higher-ups interrupted him.

“Alright, from today on, don’t mention Yan Ruoxue anymore. We are looking for you for something more important,”a higher-up said.

Although Gu Xinghe was unwilling, he could only nod.

The higher-ups said in a low voice, “We are going to disappear for a period of time. During this period, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association will be handed over to the second secret realm to manage.”

Gu Xinghe was stunned and said with some confusion, “My lords, where are you going?”

“No need to ask,”the higher-ups said coldly.

“Then... how long will it take?”Gu Xinghe continued to ask.

“Not necessarily. At least half a year, at most several years,”the higher-ups replied.

“In short, when we return, we can appear in this world.”

Without waiting for Gu Xinghe to continue asking questions, the higher-ups slowly disappeared.

“Appear in this world?”Gu Xinghe could not help but frown.

In other words, when the time came, these eight higher-ups would be able to appear in this world with their real bodies?

For more than a hundred years, no one in the JINGDU martial arts association had seen the true faces of these eight higher-ups!

Now that they were suddenly about to appear, could it be that something big was about to happen?

Gu Xinghe did not think too much about it. To him, these things were not important.

...

The next day.

The battle between the martial saint and Yan Jinyao that Gu Xinghe had arranged had officially begun.

This battle had attracted countless gazes, and the result was even more shocking!

That Martial Saint had actually lost to Yan Jinyao!

Although Yan Jinyao had won by a narrow margin with one move, this result had shocked everyone!

“Not long ago, Qin Yu had just defeated a martial saint. Today, Yan Jinyao did the same thing. Could it be that a martial marquis defeating a martial saint is Nothing?”

“Both of them are peerless geniuses. It’s nothing to be surprised that they could do the same thing.”

“I really didn’t expect that two people would be able to break history, and our generation would be able to witness it with our own eyes.”

There were many different opinions, and everyone could not help but sigh.

Many of the young masters of the aristocratic families were starting to get anxious.

It was fine if one Qin Yu had done it, but now that Yan Jinyao had done the same thing, how could they not be anxious.

And the one who was the angriest was undoubtedly Gu Xinghe.

He had seen with his own eyes that Qin Yu’s bloodline had seeped into Yan Jinyao’s body.

And the reason why Yan Jinyao was able to become a battle saint was because of the fusion of these two bloodlines!

“Damn it, damn it!”Gu Xinghe was so angry that veins were popping out all over his head!

Just when Gu Xinghe was angry, Tian Xuehong suddenly walked in from outside the door. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Young master Gu, what are you so angry about?”Tian Xuehong asked indifferently.

Gu Xinghe suddenly raised his head and looked at Tian Xuehong.

He took a deep breath and suppressed his anger as he said, “I can promise you what you want to do, but what benefits will I get?”

Tian Xuehong raised his eyebrows and said, “Benefits? Didn’t I promise to give you a thousand spiritual stones?”

Gu Xinghe sneered, “Tian Xuehong, do you think I’m a Beggar?”

Tian Xuehong was not in a hurry to answer. He walked around the room, then stopped and said indifferently, “I can let you become a martial saint. Is this enough?”
