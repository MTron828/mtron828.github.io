Chapter 354: The Furious Yan Sihai Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

If news of Old Mister Yan’s imprisonment spread, the entire Jingdu would probably be in an uproar!

As the Yan family’s most ruthless person, how could Yan Sihai tolerate it!?

After a phone call from him, countless people instantly gathered in the Yan family’s manor!

These people included both martial artists and patrol officers!

Just the number of martial artists alone reached a hundred!

And more than half of them were peak martial artists above the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm!

Such a large-scale gathering had probably never appeared before!

Hundreds of people stood in the Yan family’s manor. Everyone was waiting for Yan Sihai’s orders.

Yan Sihai held a cigar and said coldly, “Whoever dares to stop you guys, kill them!”

“Yes!”

The martial artists shouted loudly in unison!

“Rumble...”

Helicopters slowly came from not far away and stopped in the manor.

One luxury car after another lined up in rows in an imposing manner!

Yan Sihai and the others were the first to board the helicopters, then they rushed towards the North Province Island!

At this moment, Feng Chong still didn’t know what had happened.

As the absolute overlord of the North Province Island, Feng Chong was like a local emperor.

As long as he didn’t provoke those people from Jingdu, Feng Chong could enjoy almost anything.

But he never thought that his nephew would cause him such trouble.

The helicopter flew high in the sky and slowly stopped below the office in the center of the North Province Island.

As soon as it stopped, Yan Sihai walked down from the plane.

Beside him stood dozens of martial artists, all waiting for Yan Sihai’s orders.

Yan Sihai blew out a smoke ring and then strode into the office!

The security guards in the office were stunned when they saw this scene.

They hurried forward and whispered, “Sir, who are you looking for?”

“Get lost!” Yan Sihai slapped him to the side.

“Sir, this is Feng Chong’s place. Don’t cause trouble!” A security guard braced himself and said.

Yan Sihai sneered. “Feng Chong? Who does he think he is? Get lost!”

The group of people rampaged and no one could stop them!

None of the top martial artists in the office together could stop them!

Upstairs, in the office, a bald man in a white shirt was slowly sipping tea.

He looked out of the window from above and couldn’t help but feel smug.

At this moment, Feng Chong’s secretary rushed in in a hurry.

“Mr. Feng, something bad has happened!” The secretary said while panting.

Feng Chong frowned and said, “What’s the matter?”

The secretary swallowed hard and said, “A group of people came downstairs just now. Without any explanation, they beat up anyone they saw!”

“Oh really?” Feng Chong raised his eyebrows.f

“Let the security team deal with it.” Feng Chong didn’t take it seriously. After all, there were ignorant people every year.

The secretary forced a smile and said, “The security team... is completely defeated. They are no match for them.”

Feng Chong’s expression immediately changed.

One had to know that the people in his security team were all elites! There were even several Inner Strength Grandmasters among them!

If even they weren’t a match for him, then what was his background?

“Who’s the leader?” Feng Chong put down his teacup and asked hurriedly.

“Me!”

At this moment, the office door was kicked open.

Then, he saw Yan Sihai, who had a strong build, walk in with great strides.

When he saw Yan Sihai, Feng Chong’s expression immediately turned extremely ugly!

He?was the young master of the Yan family! One of the heirs of the Yan family!

“President... President Yan, why are you here? What’s with the big formation...” Feng Chong hurriedly went up to greet him.

Yan Sihai looked at Feng Chong coldly and said, “Why am I here? Feng Chong, you’ve grown too big for your britches.”

Feng Chong said with some confusion, “President... President Yan, I don’t understand what you’re saying!”

“You don’t understand?” Yan Sihai’s eyes flashed with coldness, and then he slapped Feng Chong’s face!

As the overlord of the North Continent Island, he was slapped twice in front of everyone.

Most importantly, Feng Chong didn’t dare to retaliate!

“Arrest him!” Yan Sihai said coldly.

The two Inner Strength Grandmasters immediately stepped forward, grabbed Feng Chong’s neck, and pressed him on the table.

Feng Chong was extremely terrified. He said anxiously, “Mr. Yan, even if you want to kill me, you have to give me a reason. I. . . I really don’t know what I have done to offend you...”

“You don’t know?” Yan Sihai walked forward and grabbed Feng Chong by the hair.

“My father was imprisoned on the North Province Island. You don’t know about this?” Yan Sihai said coldly.

Feng Chong was so scared that he almost fainted!

Old Mister Yan was imprisoned on the North Province Island? How outrageous!

“Mr. Yan, I swear that this matter has nothing to do with me. I... I’ll go and investigate now, okay?” Feng Chong said anxiously.

Yan Sihai sneered. “It’s too late! I’ll go and find him myself.”

“As for you, be careful in your next life.” Yan Sihai sneered.

Feng Chong’s face was extremely pale. In a moment of panic, he shouted at his secretary, “What’s going on?! Why didn’t anyone tell me that Old Mister Yan came to the North Province Island?! Also, I’ll skin whoever touched Old Mister Yan!”

The secretary opened his mouth and whispered, “Your nephew, Li Wenqiang, just kidnapped an old man. I wonder if it’s Old Mister Yan...”

Nephew?

Feng Chong was exasperated!

This time, he wouldn’t be able to clear his name no matter what!

“Your nephew kidnapped my father, and he wants me to apologize to him. Feng Chong, you’re quite something,” Yan Sihai said with narrowed eyes.

Feng Chong was about to speak when Yan Sihai kicked Feng Chong’s calf!

With a crack, Feng Chong’s calf immediately bent backward in a strange arc!

“Ah!!” Feng Chong yelled out in pain.

“Don’t scream!” Yan Sihai berated coldly.

Feng Chong gritted his teeth and endured it.

“Yan... President Yan, can you give me a chance? I’ll go and settle the score with him right now!” Feng Chong braced himself and said.

“Even if you want to kill me, you have to find Old Mister Yan first, don’t you?”

Yan Sihai glanced at Feng Chong coldly and snorted. “Fine, then I’ll let you live for a few more minutes.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Go and find him right now!” Yan Sihai said angrily.

The two Inner Strength Grandmasters beside him quickly let go of Feng Chong.

Feng Chong hurriedly took out his phone and called Mr. Zeng.

“Did you kidnap an old man?” Feng Chong said anxiously.

Mr. Zeng said, “Yes, your nephew asked us to do it. What’s wrong, Mr. Feng?”

Feng Chong gritted his teeth and said angrily, “Where is he now?”

“He’s in the warehouse by the shore,” Mr. Zeng said.

Feng Chong quickly hung up the phone.

He looked at Yan Sihai with trembling lips and said, “Mr. Yan, I... I’m going to find Old Mister Yan now...”
