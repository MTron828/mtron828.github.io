Chapter 1280: Chapter 1,280, the Golden Wheel attacked 

The sky gradually darkened.

In the green rock forest, the roars of wild beasts could be heard from time to time, and the forest shook.

Qin Yu sat in his room, still studying his spirit cultivating clothes.

At this moment, the door was suddenly kicked open.

Then, an extremely huge man was seen standing at the door.

His body actually covered the entire door. Even Guan Zhuang looked small in front of him.

“Big Brother Jin Lun, it’s him!”

The muscular man whose arm had been broken by Qin Yu pointed at Qin Yu and shouted.

Jin Lun looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “You are Qin Yu?”

Qin Yu smiled and said in a neither servile nor overbearing manner, “You are the so-called hunter King, Jin Lun?”

Jin Lun ignored this sentence and said in a cold tone, “Why did you hurt my man?”

“Because he deserves to be beaten. Since he came to find trouble, he should be mentally prepared to get hurt,”Qin Yu said indifferently.

These words were meant to warn Jin Lun as well as the injured Brawny Man.

Of course, Jin Lun understood the reason behind these words. He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “You are very brave.”

“Likewise,”Qin Yu said with a faint smile.

At this moment, the team leader, Jing Bai, and many other hunters rushed over.

“Jin Lun, what are you doing!”The team leader scolded.

“Jin Lun, we are all affiliated with the Hunter organization. We should live together peacefully.”

“Yeah, Qin Yu paid out of his own pocket to give us new equipment. From this, we can see that he is a good person.”

“There are many people in this hunter organization who earn a lot of money. The only one who is willing to contribute is Qin Yu.”

Hearing this, Jin Lun’s face was immediately filled with frost.

“Are you complaining that I didn’t pay?”Jin Lun said darkly.

“Of course I don’t have such intentions.”The hunter hurriedly waved his hand and said.

The group leader stepped forward to mediate the situation and said, “Jin Lun, if you really want to compete, why don’t you compete to see who kills more demonic beasts? Why do you need to fight with each other?”

Jin Lun sneered and looked down at Qin Yu. He said, “Wouldn’t that be letting this kid off easy? Moreover, he injured my people. How could I spare him?”

Qin Yu didn’t give in. He said indifferently, “Don’t worry. I Won’t accept the team leader’s suggestion.”

Jin Lun narrowed his eyes and said in a low voice, “You brat who doesn’t know the immensity of Heaven and earth. If I don’t Teach You a lesson, won’t You Pierce through the Heavens?”

After he finished speaking, Jin Lun suddenly kicked at Qin Yu!

At this moment, Qin Yu was sitting on the ground, but Jin Lun shamelessly attacked suddenly!

His thick and strong thigh was like a telephone pole, incomparably terrifying. Once it was touched, it would either kill or injure!

Seeing Jin Lun who suddenly launched a sneak attack, a trace of coldness flashed across Qin Yu’s face.

He didn’t Dodge, but suddenly clenched his fist, and with a bang, he met the Attack!

The fist and foot collided, instantly shattering the entire room!

The surrounding people were also affected by the impact and all retreated backwards.

As for Jin Lun, he was even more unsteady and almost fell to the ground.

Qin Yu slowly stood up from the ground. He looked at Jin Lun coldly and said, “I thought you were a good man. I didn’t expect you to be a scum who likes sneak attacks.”

Jin Lun sneered and said, “I gamble with demon beasts every day and understand the principle that victory is all that matters. Do I have to talk about morality with you?”

These words seemed reasonable, but in fact, they were Bullsh * t.

He compared Qin Yu to a Demon Beast. This was simply B * Stard logic.

“In that case, there’s no need to talk nonsense,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“Please.”

Jin Lun did not stand on ceremony. He immediately turned around and walked towards the Green Rock Forest.

“I’ll wait for you in the Green Rock Forest. I hope you won’t be afraid to fight.”Jin Lun’s explosive voice was like thunder that entered everyone’s ears.

Looking at Jin Lun walking towards the Green Rock Forest, the surrounding hunters all stepped forward to advise him, “Qin Yu, it’s better if you don’t go.”

“Yeah, this Jin Lun didn’t take it lightly. It’s very easy to kill someone.”

How Could Qin Yu listen to them? Jin Lun’s actions had thoroughly angered Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, they’re right.”At this moment, Jing Bai also walked over.

He pulled Qin Yu to the side and whispered, “The reason why he chose the green rock forest is very likely to be a trap.”

Qin Yu frowned.

Jing Bai’s words were quite reasonable.

Judging from Jin Lun’s various actions, it was very likely that he would do despicable things.

But if he didn’t go, he would definitely be ridiculed.

After hesitating for a while, Qin Yu finally said, “I’ll go and fight with him. No matter how he plays tricks, I’m not afraid of him.”

After saying this, Qin Yu ignored everyone’s obstruction and walked into the depths of green rock forest.

The remaining hunters looked at each other in dismay. They subconsciously looked at their team leader as if they were waiting for his order.

“Let’s go and take a look too. No matter what, we can’t let anyone die,”said the team leader in a deep voice.

The many hunters present immediately followed closely behind and walked towards the depths of the green rock forest.

In a certain mountain forest in the Green Rock Forest.

Jin Lun, who was like a small mountain, had his arms crossed in front of his chest, waiting for Qin Yu’s arrival.

His follower followed by his side, looking forward to his arrival.

Very quickly, Qin Yu walked over from the other side of the mountain forest, step by step.

“Big Brother, he’s Here!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

After seeing Qin Yu’s figure, Jin Lun finally opened his eyes.

A cold glint flashed in his eyes, and his fists were slightly clenched.

“Big Brother, rumor has it that this kid’s physical body is extremely powerful. No one can match him. You have to be careful,”Jin Lun’s follower reminded him.

Jin Lun snorted and said, “I can crush his bony body with just a little bit of force.”

“That’s right. Big Brother can even crush the bones of Demonic Beasts, let alone that Qin Yu!”
