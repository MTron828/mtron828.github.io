2327 The Terrifying Strength

He carefully sensed the energy contained within, and this energy exploded.

The cultivation this time was indeed a gamble. No one with a chaotic body had ever tried this cultivation method.

His divine sense and physical body would have turned into ashes if he had failed earlier.

Qin Yu now vaguely understood that he had reached the True Saint Realm.

Perhaps there were two paths of cultivation. One was for cultivators like the evil exterminator who followed the Path of Heaven and rose to the top.

The other was cultivators like Xi Menn, who had taken a different path. They had abandoned the traditional path of cultivation.

Using another method to increase their strength, the Nine Paths Convergence of the masked woman and Wu Ji’s degenerate path more or less did not follow the Path of Heaven.

Qin Yu had two heaven-defying cultivation methods, the Soul Torment Mind Technique, and the Traceless Immortal Scripture.

Using these two methods to compress his power of the soul and chaotic qi should also be a different way.

He vaguely felt that his father had left him many cultivation methods.

They were the Star Seal, Saintly Body Technique, and other cultivation techniques.

However, he did not leave behind his core cultivation techniques like Senior Wu Ji did.

Qin Yu was not clear if he was reminding Qin Yu of something.

“Qin Yu, are you alright?”

Jue Wu came to Qin Yu’s side and looked at him nervously.

“You attack me with all your might, and I’ll use one hand. I’ll also not move my feet.”

Qin Yu said in a teasing manner and mimicked a limp.

“Are you asking for a beating?” Jue Wu was furious upon hearing this.

After her breakthrough, she was already in the eighth grade. Even an ordinary ninth-grade True Saint was no match for her.

“Boom!”

The enormous force directly sent Qin Yu flying, his face ashen.

Before he could react, Jue Wu had already arrived before him.

Jue Wu’s fist landed on his body in the blink of an eye.

Qin Yu’s expression turned solemn, and a stream of vital energy surged from the Bead of Chaos Pearl in his dantian.

That vital energy entered Qin Yu’s palm, and in an instant, a gray light appeared on Qin Yu’s palm.

That palm blocked Jue Wu’s fists and kicks, and Jue Wu seemed to have encountered an insurmountable peak.

The terrifying strength was instantly absorbed when the fists and kicks landed on Qin Yu’s hand.

Jue Wu’s body seemed to have sensed danger, and her hair stood on end.

With a solemn expression, she bent her body slightly and dashed forward like an arrow leaving the bow.

A giant beast shadow appeared at her back as if it had triggered the power of the fierce beast in the void.

“Boom!”

The giant hand suddenly grabbed at Qin Yu but was caught by Qin Yu at the peak of its strength.

It was like an adult holding a child’s fist, unable to break free.

“Qin Yu, try this move of mine.”

Seeing Juewu unable to break through Qin Yu’s defense, Mei Li was also somewhat curious.

The blood-red spiritual energy in her hand flowed on her palm, and a blood river formed in the air.

It then turned into a sharp arrow and attacked Qin Yu. The weight of the blood river turned into a sharp arrow.

This attack was even more terrifying than the fierce beast’s punch from Jue Wu earlier.

The vital energy of the Bead of Chaos in Qin Yu’s hand flowed to his index finger, and then he struck the arrow with his finger.

“Watch out!”

Mei Li cried out. She did not expect Qin Yu to use his finger to receive her arrow.

It was the utmost attack method she had recently comprehended.

However, she did not see the scene of Qin Yu’s finger shattering. Instead, a gray light rushed out.

Her blood river suddenly collapsed and turned into spiritual energy, filling the sky.

“So powerful!”

Jue Wu was dumbfounded.

“Get ready to set off at any time. I can sense the changes in the Path of Heaven will arrive soon.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath.

If it weren’t for the fact that the time was approaching, he wouldn’t have fought so hard.

This time, he could condense the Bead of Chaos. His chances of entering the ninth level were slightly higher.

…

At this moment, in the boundless void.

A multicolored rosy light appeared in the sky far away.

After that, the stars in the sky seemed affected and began to rotate slowly.

In the purgatory galaxy covered by countless stars, the rules of the Path of Heaven suddenly changed slightly.

The multicolored rosy light quietly spread out and slowly landed on the entire purgatory.

Within the area covered by the multicolored rosy light, regardless of demonic beasts or cultivators, were moved.

The power of rules that it enveloped was as if changing subtly.

“The Path of Heaven has already begun to change. Jue Wu, let’s go.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath.

Qin Yu looked at the compass in the sky, his eyes looking to the extremely distant depths.

The way they solved the problem did not change with his breakthrough. Instead, their chances of survival became even smaller…

Qin Yu kept away the chaotic qi evolved from the five elements and eight trigrams. His Sumeru qi wrapped around Jue Wu and was about to enter the ninth level.

“Boom!”

Qin Yu’s Sumeru qi bounced back violently as if Jue Wu was resisting.

“Jue Wu, there is no way out at this point…”

He turned around and suddenly realized something was not right.

Jue Wu stared at him strangely. At this moment, her eyes had lost their pupils.

Her body slowly emitted a demonic qi, and in an instant, the violent demonic qi soared into the sky.

In the hundreds of thousands of feet high in the sky, this surge of demonic energy blew away all the clouds for tens of thousands of miles.

On her body, a demonic egg flew out of her spatial ring.

“Crack!”

The instant the demonic egg appeared, the entire eighth level of purgatory was suddenly covered in countless dark clouds.

The massive dark clouds gathered and rushed toward their direction. This sudden change instantly attracted the attention of almost everyone in the eighth level of purgatory.

“Could it be that another spatial rift will appear? What a terrifying demonic qi!”

“This demonic qi is much more terrifying than the monster race that had appeared before!”

“What is this egg? Why is it emitting such an internal qi?”

More and more onlookers gathered. Qin Yu was in a state of extreme anxiety. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

He had planned to bring Jue Wu into the ninth level of purgatory once the Path of Heaven changed.

But now, they had encountered such a change. The demonic egg seemed to have hatched.

The demonic egg slowly floated before Jue Wu. At this moment, it was already four to five times bigger than the demon he had obtained at the beginning.

The demonic egg was the size of a human.

Suddenly, a majestic surge of demonic qi shot out from the middle of the demonic egg and connected with Jue Wu.

Jue Wu suddenly raised her head, her hair flying in all directions.

Before her and the demonic egg, a wall of demonic qi descended from above, transforming into a magnificent palace and enveloping them.

Even Qin Yu unleashed his desolate divine eye but could not peek into the appearance within.

The demonic qi was rising at a terrifying speed.
