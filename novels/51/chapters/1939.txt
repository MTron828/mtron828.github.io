1940 Guidance from Expert or Comprehending Dao?

But now, everything seemed very quiet, and no one paid extra attention to Qin Yu.

After staying in the gambling house for several days, Qin Yu was relieved to see no one come to create trouble.

He left the gambling house and planned to find a place to forge a Saint Weapon with the materials he had.

Therefore, Qin Yu found a teahouse and planned to probe for information.

As soon as he sat down, someone beside him greeted, “You’re that Qin Yu, are you?”

“That’s right. I’m Qin Yu,” Qin Yu nodded repeatedly and said.

The cultivator didn’t talk nonsense and immediately walked to Qin Yu’s table and sat down, saying, “A few days ago, you clamored at the Si family. You’re quite bold.”

“Brother, are you trying to stand out for the Si family?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and asked.

“Me? Stand out for the Si family? What nonsense are you thinking about?” the cultivator rolled his eyes and said.

“The Si family has sumptuous meals and the best resources for cultivation, but what about me? I f*cking went through a tough time, lived miserably every day, and relied on the meager spiritual energy to cultivate before getting to where I am today. Would I stand up for them? Am I sick, or are you sick?”

Qin Yu scratched his head, thinking that it made sense.

“You’re quite conscious,” Qin Yu mumbled. As he spoke, he probed his cultivation realm with his divine sense and discovered he was already at the middle stage of the Reversion Void. Moreover, he was quite young.

“It seems that this kid’s state of mind is indeed not bad. No wonder he has such cultivation.”

Qin Yu thought for a while and asked, “Brother, you have such thoughts means you have your own independent thinking and awareness, but others don’t think the same. Many people have used this as a springboard and a chance to enter the Si family. However, why hasn’t anyone done anything to me in the past few days?”

The cultivator chuckled. He glanced at the Imperial Palace not far away and said, “This is the f*cking Sky City. No matter how miserable the Great Xia Royal Family has become, they’re still the f*cking royal family. Who would want to get themselves into trouble here? If you don’t believe me, you can try walking out of Sky City.”

Qin Yu suddenly realized why no one had made a move for several days.

“Speaking of which, I’m quite impressed by you. You’re brave enough to pursue what you love!” the cultivator said with emotion.

“To be honest, I also f*cking like Yan Ruoxue, but I don’t have the guts like yours to do so,” he said with a smile.

Qin Yu glared at him and said, “You’re f8cking not allowed to like Yan Ruoxue. Yan Ruoxue is mine. Do you understand?”

When the cultivator heard this, he instantly laughed.

He waved his hand and said, “My friend, you don’t have to be so nervous. I f*cking like many people. I like all the women in the world, yet I don’t like any of them.”

What he said had a deep meaning, and Qin Yu was rather curious about these contradictory statements.

“Why did you say so?” Qin Yu asked.

This fellow took a sip of tea and said, “What do you f*cking mean you like or not? They’re just beauties. I like them due to my desire, not my person.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but give the cultivator a thumbs-up and said, “Big brother’s cultivation realm is indeed high.”

“It’s just so-so. In fact, I learned it from others. Look at me. What the hell can I comprehend?” the cultivator said proudly.

Qin Yu could also tell that this kid was merely a funny fellow. He used “f*cking” to emphasize everything he said. He did not look like an expert who had enlightened.

“Who did you learn this from?” Qin Yu continued to ask.

The cultivator smiled and said, “From a master who gave me a few pointers. Since then, my cultivation advanced by leaps and bounds. It indeed f*cking advanced by leaps and bounds!

The more he spoke, the more excited he became, and he nearly stood up.

From what he said, Qin Yu learned that his cultivation had stagnated for a few years. No matter how many treasures he had devoured, he failed to advance in his cultivation realm.

After discussing the dao with that master, his cultivation had been smooth and rapid, and he had stepped into his current cultivation realm.

After listening to his story, Qin Yu touched his chin and seemed to understand something.

“Where is that expert?” Qin Yu asked.

“I don’t know,” the cultivator replied. “I’ve said that I met him by chance. I don’t even know his name.”

“I had wanted to follow him, but he said I’m not talented enough. It’s already reached my limit to comprehend these two sentences,” the cultivator said with some regret.

Qin Yu touched his chin, and countless thoughts flashed through his mind instantly.

Could it be that the path he was pursuing was wrong?

Qin Yu did not seem to lack any resources now. The dragon blood in his hands was already enough for his cultivation.

However, no matter how much he devoured, his strength did not improve at all.

“That expert had said that once you achieved enlightenment, you would be invincible. Cultivation is not about the length of time. Everyone is f*cking wrong!” the cultivator continued.

Qin Yu’s eyes lit up, and he seemed more clear-headed now.

“There’s a temple fair in a few days, are you aware? It’s right in Sky City! You must f*cking attend. There will be a dao lecture there, and it’s a dao technique of the Great Xia Royal Family!” the cultivator said.

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. When he was about to stand up to thank him, he realized the ‘f*cking cultivator’ had disappeared.

“Eh?” Qin Yu was stunned. He hurriedly stood up and looked around, but he couldn’t find him.

Qin Yu hurriedly tried to find the cultivator with his divine sense but failed.

It was as though the “f*cking cultivator” had never appeared.

“Strange.” Qin Yu’s frown furrowed even tighter.

He looked at the person at the table next to him and said, “My friend, where is the person who was talking to me just now?”

“Was there anyone here? Didn’t you just mumble to yourself?” the cultivator muttered.

“You were mumbling like a lunatic just now,” he muttered. “And I thought I had bumped into an idiot.”

Qin Yu’s expression turned ugly.

That ‘f*cking cultivator’ just now didn’t even exist! How could it be? Then who was the person he was talking to?

Could it be that he was comprehending dao himself? That f*cking cultivator was also an illusion?

...

Impossible! That was absolutely impossible!

The f*cking cultivator had said that he wanted Qin Yu to attend the temple fair in Sky City, and Qin Yu didn’t know anything about it at all!

He couldn’t have said something that he was not aware of! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Could it be there’s an expert here?” Qin Yu stood up straight, his heart full of doubts.

Who was this expert if an expert were here to give him pointers? Why would he help him?

To be able to make himself undetected or even unseen by people, how terrifying must his cultivation be?

“May I ask… Is there a temple fair in Sky City?” Qin Yu tried to ask the person beside him.

“Of course. Didn’t you see more and more people coming to Sky City these days? They’re all here for the temple fair,” the cultivator said.
