Chapter 479: The Attack of the Saint Confucian Sect Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Once this news was released, it caused an uproar in the entire Martial Arts Forum!

One was the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, which had an extraordinary status, while the other was the largest sect in the northern region.

These two large factions actually had a conflict?

This was probably the first time in history!

“What a troublesome year.”

Everyone couldn’t help but sigh.

The past few decades were probably not as eventful as this year alone! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“The Saint Confucian Sect actually made a move against the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. According to what I know, as long as the Divine Alchemist Pavilion swings its arm, there will definitely be many people coming to support it,” someone said.

“That’s right, and the connections of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion are extremely powerful.”

“Although that’s the case, the Saint Confucian Sect isn’t bad either. They have Martial Marquises.”

Everyone who was discussing immediately fell silent.

A Martial Marquis was too powerful. No one was willing to cross a Martial Marquis.

In this world, other than modern weapons, probably no one could stop a Martial Marquis!

Within the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, the Pavilion Master naturally knew of this matter.

Looking at the letter of challenge issued by the Saint Confucian Sect, the Pavilion Master, who had always been as calm, frowned.

“Saint Confucian Sect...” the Pavilion Master murmured.

The eight Law Enforcement Elders all stood below the pavilion, as if waiting for the Pavilion Master’s order.

The Pavilion Master was silent for a moment. Then, she stepped on the ground and gently landed from the pavilion.

“Lord Pavilion Master!” The elders shouted in unison.

The Pavilion Master was silent. No one knew what she was thinking.

No one knew what kind of decision the Pavilion Master would make.

“Lord Pavilion Master, we will do our best.” A few Law Enforcement Elders shouted.

“I will gather people tomorrow.”

“Many aristocratic families owe our Divine Alchemist Pavilion a favor. I believe they will lend a hand!”

The eight Law Enforcement Elders expressed their opinions, but none of them were afraid.

However, at this moment, the Pavilion Master shook her head.

She looked at the Law Enforcement Elders and said slowly, “Inform them that from today onwards, the Divine Alchemist Pavilion will have a break.”

“What?!”

The Law Enforcement Elders were instantly stunned.

At this critical moment, not only did the Divine Alchemist Pavilion not gather manpower, but it even wanted to have a break?

“Lord Pavilion Master, how can we have a break at this time?”

“That’s right, what if the Saint Confucian Sect attacks, how should we deal with it?”

The Pavilion Master said in a deep voice, “As alchemists, their duty is to refine pills. It’s meaningless for them to stay, and it will only increase the casualties.”

This was the truth. The martial strength of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s alchemists was naturally incomparable to that of the Saint Confucian Sect.

“I... I understand.” First Elder sighed.

Just as they were about to turn around and leave, the Pavilion Master suddenly said, “All of you can leave for now.”

The eight of them were instantly stunned on the spot.

“We’re leaving too?” The few of them turned around and were dumbstruck.

The Pavilion Master nodded and said, “Yes.”

“Lord Pavilion Master, why is this happening?”

“That’s right. If we leave, what will happen to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?”

“Lord Pavilion Master, no!”

The Pavilion Master said in a deep voice, “If the Saint Confucian Sect sends out a Martial Marquis, it’s useless for you guys to stay.”

“If it’s only a half-step Martial Marquis, there’s nothing they can do.”

Even though that was the case, no one knew how powerful the Saint Confucian Sect was.

“Lord Pavilion Master, the possibility of the Saint Confucian Sect sending out a Martial Marquis isn’t high. After all, a Martial Marquis hasn’t appeared for many years.” The First Elder bowed and said.

“Let us stay. Although we aren’t powerful, we can at least stop them for a while.”

Seeing everyone’s loyalty, the Pavilion Master frowned.

She thought for a moment and said, “Alright, half-step Martial Marquises will stay. Everyone else will have a break.”

“Pavilion Master, I...”

“No need to say more.” The Pavilion Master interrupted them.

the few Law Enforcement Elders had no choice but to agree.

...

In the warehouse, Qin Yu was absorbing spiritual energy ravenously.

Streams of spiritual energy flowed into his body. As he circulated his cultivation technique, his dantian was like a bottomless pit.

Above his head, the Three Pure Ancient Tree was shining and calming his mind.

Qin Yu knew nothing about what was happening in the outside world.

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

Qin Yu’s dantian seemed to have no limits. He didn’t know how much spiritual energy he had absorbed, but there were still no signs of a breakthrough.

At this time, the outside world was already in an uproar.

Qinghe Town, which had always been peaceful, had been filled with lurking danger recently.

The citizens of Qinghe Town had naturally heard of this news.

“D*mn it, when has there ever been such a conflict in Qinghe Town?!”

“It’s all because of Qin Yu! That guy is a jinx. Wherever he goes, there will be disasters!”

“We have to drive him out of Qinghe Town!”

For a time, Qin Yu became the target of public criticism.

But in reality, the dispute between the Saint Confucian Sect and the Divine Alchemist Pavilion had nothing to do with ordinary people like them.

These few days, the usually lively Divine Alchemist Pavilion had become somewhat deserted.

And within the Saint Confucian Sect, Elder Qu finally received an order.

“Remember, capture the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion alive,” Gu Canghai said coldly.

Elder Qu hurriedly stood up and said, “Sect master, the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion has extraordinary strength. How about... I bring a Martial Marquis Weapon?”

Gu Canghai glanced coldly at Elder Qu and said, “Do you think that a Martial Marquis Weapon is as abundant as cabbages on the roadside?”

“You have five half-step Martial Marquises. If you can’t even deal with an individual like the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, then don’t return to our Saint Confucian Sect.”

Elder Qu still wanted to say something, but Gu Canghai didn’t give him a chance. He turned his head and left.

“Elder Qu, the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion is just a woman. Are you that afraid of her?” A man in his forties said indifferently.

This man’s name was Xu Beigou. He was one of the Saint Confucian Sect’s candidates for the elder position and was also a half-step Martial Marquis.

Back then, the two of them had competed for the position of Elder, but in the end, they had chosen Elder Qu.

This had also led to the enmity between the two of them.

Elder Qu glanced at him and snorted coldly. “Xu Beigou, you’d better not underestimate this woman.”

Xu beigou sneered. “What, could it be that she’s a Martial Marquis?”

“Do you think a Martial Marquis is as abundant as cabbages on the roadside?” Elder Qu snorted coldly.

“That’s it,” Xu Beiliu said indifferently.

“As long as she isn’t a Martial Marquis, what’s there to be afraid of?”

Elder Qu couldn’t help but frown.

He said slowly, “Although we are both half-step Martial Marquises, her strength is far above mine.”

The previous simple collision had shocked Elder Qu and he vomited blood continuously.

If they were to really fight, these five half-step Martial Marquises might not be a match for the Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s Pavilion Master.

“I think you’re scared.” Xu Beiliu snickered.

“Just because you’re not a match for her does not mean that we aren’t a match for her.”

Elder Qu’s expression turned cold as he sneered. “I have warned you in advance. When you suffer a loss, don’t regret it.”

Xu Beizhong sneered. “If you’re afraid, then stay.”

Xu Beizhong waved his hand and said, “Let’s go eradicate the Divine Alchemist Pavilion!”
