Lightning crackled and streaked across the sky, with arcs intersecting, emanating dazzling lights. The collision of dark and golden energies resulted in intense electric currents surging in the air. The sky was filled with sparks and flashes as if the apocalypse had descended.

The ground also suffered a violent impact. It cracked, and the rocks collapsed, forming a dangerous terrain. Enormous energy spread out, destroying the surrounding buildings and natural landscape.

The air was full of scorching internal qi and deafening explosions. Energy fluctuations raged, engulfing everything.

The storm raged, and the wind howled, bringing up soil and dust, forming a blurry scene. The energy flow between heaven and earth was abnormally violent, resulting in vortexes and distorting the space beyond recognition.

Nevertheless, under the might of the fourth heavenly tribulation, Qin Yu felt tremendously pressured and was even continuously suppressed by this fourth heavenly tribulation!

His feet almost crushed the ground. At this moment, the ground beneath turned into an incomparably hard substance, attempting to compress Qin Yu’s physical body and smash it into meat paste!

Qin Yu gritted his teeth, and with a furious roar, he instantly activated the fighting word formula!

“Fighting word formula, the fourth level!”

Following Qin Yu’s furious roar, the Golden Light on Qin Yu’s body instantly became even more dazzling, and his internal qi soared by several times!

But the fourth heavenly tribulation was not to be outdone either. It released monstrous dark energy attempting to resist Qin Yu’s attack. The dark and golden energy clashed, resulting in a terrifying shockwave.

However, Qin Yu was no longer the same as before, augmented by many techniques. He withstood the terrifying pressure single-handedly and suddenly punched out fiercely!

“Boom!”

The space instantly distorted as endless energy erupted as if it wanted to tear the world apart. The enormous fist shadow collided with the dark energy, releasing a deafening explosion.

A powerful shockwave swept up, and boundless energy fluctuations wreaked havoc in all directions. At that moment, the ground crumbled, mountains collapsed, and everything turned into rubble.

Qin Yu’s fist pierced through the defense of the fourth heavenly tribulation and hit the origin of the darkness. A shocking light burst out, incomparably dazzling, illuminating the entire battlefield.

The darkness began to collapse, and patches of dark energy dissipated like tides. It was devoured by the golden light.

Qin Yu’s eyes flickered with a bright light. He seized the opportunity and launched another attack. His figure was as fast as lightning, and every move he made carried the power of a thunderbolt.

The enormous hand trembled continuously. As Qin Yu punched non-stop, cracks finally appeared on the gigantic hand!

“Crack!”

With another crisp sound, the gigantic hand began to shatter, turning into blue spots that scattered everywhere like fireflies!

He stared at the disappearing fourth heavenly tribulation, and invincible battle intent filled his eyes!

The sky gradually turned quiet, and the ferocious face began to disappear. There were only dark clouds continuously gathering in the sky.

From time to time, a flash of light would appear in the dark clouds. The light was no longer blue but like a massive net interwoven by dao techniques.

Qin Yu had a sense of foreboding in his heart, and a hint of unease even crept in.

He stared at the heavenly tribulation that was constantly brewing. It seemed that several heavenly tribulations were slowly strengthening and multiplying.

“Phew…”

All of a sudden, a hurricane swept across the heavens and earth.

The wind was tremendously strange as golden light kept flashing.

Following that, a dao technique began to flash in the void!

It was one golden thread after another. At first, it was hard to capture, but then it became visible to the naked eye. Finally, it was densely packed, almost covering the entire heavens and earth!

Qin Yu’s expression instantly changed drastically upon seeing this scene, and he was incomparably shocked for a moment!

It was impossible to capture the dao technique. Even on the day of the Path of Heaven, it only be seen with the naked eye!

However, in this world here, dao techniques were everywhere!

Qin Yu’s expression became increasingly solemn. He dared not be negligent. He immediately adjusted his internal qi to the peak and instantly activated the fifth-level fighting word formula!

“Buzz!”

When Qin Yu saw this person’s face, his expression instantly turned tremendously ugly!
