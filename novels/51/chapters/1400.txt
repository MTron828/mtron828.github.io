Chapter 1401: Chapter 1401, activating the Divine Inscription Formation 1

Sister Lin had already guessed it, but when she heard it with her own ears, she still felt somewhat uncomfortable.

“I don’t understand what you guys are talking about. What Qin Yu? I don’t know him at all.”Although sister Lin said this, she could no longer maintain her composure.

“Then don’t waste your breath. Don’t force us to make a move.”The hemp-robed old man took a step forward. His aura suddenly exploded, and the surrounding space started to distort.

Sister Lin knew that she was no match for them, so she stopped resisting.

“I’ll go with you.”Sister Lin stood up and said.

The hemp-robed elder didn’t say anything. He grabbed sister Lin, turned around, and left.

Ding Yi stood there with an indescribable feeling in his heart.

“He really is Qin Yu...”Ding Yi muttered in a low voice. No one knew if he was excited or sad.

...

On the other side, Qin Yu had already absorbed all the water of life.

He ran to the riverside excitedly, wanting to see if the number on his forehead had disappeared.

In the reflection of the river, the number on Qin Yu’s forehead had suddenly changed to the number “One”.

Qin Yu’s brows immediately furrowed.

“It’s still a little bit off?”Qin Yu could not help but frown.

For a moment, Qin Yu didn’t know whether to be happy or worried.

He clenched his fist and felt the more abundant power in his body, but there was still no spiritual power at all.

“Damn it!”Qin Yu was extremely vexed. He was just a little bit away from recovering his spiritual power!

He stood there and thought for a long time. In the end, he decided to explore the Yangcheng mountain range again.

Although there were many dangers there, he was just a hair’s breadth away from success. Qin Yu really couldn’t wait any longer.

He didn’t think too much and turned around to rush towards Yang City.

Qin Yu planned to come to the nearest city to have a good meal before continuing on his journey.

But as soon as he sat down, he heard the discussions by the side.

“TSK TSK, it’s said that the heavenly cloud sect has already sent that Di Zun to the heavenly prison.”

“En, I heard that that Di Zun and Qin Yu had secretly met before and was discovered by the Great Elder.”

“Sigh, this is really troublesome. Not only Di Zun, but all the people related to Qin Yu have been put on death row. Di Zun is still easy to deal with. After all, his talent is there. It’s hard to say about the others.”

As soon as he said this, Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically.

He hurriedly walked over and said coldly, “What did you say? Di Zun has been caught?”

“Yeah, haven’t you heard? Recently, this matter has been causing a stir.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He took a deep breath and said coldly, “Looks like boss Zheng finally snitched...” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

At this moment, Qin Yu couldn’t help but think of Brother Dao’s words.

Perhaps, he really should have killed boss Zheng back then!

“Has sister Lin from the GU city auction been affected?”Qin Yu continued to ask.

“Yes, she’s also been arrested. It’s said that they sent out the guest elders and brought sister Lin back.”

Qin Yu nodded and turned around to leave.

At this moment, he stopped and said, “Everyone, I have a question. If I want to spread the news, where should I go?”

“Spread the news? The fastest way to spread the news is through the wind pavilion, of course,”said the person.

“Wind Pavilion?”Qin Yu frowned slightly.

The two people hummed in gratitude and said, “Most people who issue a challenge will spread the news through the wind pavilion, but the price is not cheap.”

Qin Yu sat there for a long time without saying anything. A moment later, Qin Yu took out 100,000 spirit coins and placed them in front of these people.

Seeing so many spirit coins, the eyes of everyone present immediately lit up.

“Please help me spread the news through the Wind Pavilion,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“As long as you send the message to the wind pavilion and look for me in the Divine Capital in the future, I will give you another 100,000 spirit coins.”

The few of them hurriedly nodded and said, “No problem, no problem. Just say it. What message do you want us to spread?”

Qin Yu said coldly, “Just say that Qin Yu is waiting for them in the divine capital. If you want to catch me, come to the divine capital.”

“Qin Yu? You... You Are Qin Yu?”These people widened their eyes and couldn’t help but take two steps back.

Qin Yu acknowledged and said, “Please, everyone.”

These people looked at each other and then grabbed the spirit coins in their hands.

“We will go now. Don’t Worry!”These people said with a smile.

Qin Yu acknowledged and continued, “But I have to remind you that if the news doesn’t spread, I will definitely not let you off.”

“Don’t worry. If we report your location, the Heavenly Cloud sect will reward us. Why Not?”The few of them said with a smile.

Qin Yu nodded. He didn’t say anything else and immediately rushed towards the divine capital.

On the way, Qin Yu said to tie dan, “Tie Dan, from now on, we will have to rely on you to recover the divine inscriptions there.”

Tie Dan cursed in his heart, “Damn it, I’m going to fall into a deep sleep again. How many favors do you fucking owe me?”

“Don’t worry. When this is over, I’ll find you a perfect body,”Qin Yu said to tie Dan.

Tie Dan muttered, “You’d better make sure you can survive.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. Although he wasn’t sure, he had no other choice.
