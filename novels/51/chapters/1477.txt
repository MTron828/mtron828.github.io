Chapter 1478: Chapter 1,478, it’s best not to provoke me

That strand of divine sense continuously interfered with Qin Yu, attempting to destroy Qin Yu’s mind.

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he couldn’t help but sneer.

He directly gave up resisting and allowed this strand of divine sense to drill into his mind.

Seeing this scene, Su Song couldn’t help but be stunned.

This Qin Yu, why didn’t he play by the rules?

Under normal circumstances, shouldn’t he be fighting with all his might at this time? Why did he simply let it enter his mind?

Could it be that he had already given up resisting? It was illogical!

As an alchemist, how could he give up so easily?

The spell caster in the dark could not help but be overjoyed. That strand of divine sense immediately shot into Qin Yu’s mind.

Very quickly, that strand of divine sense arrived in Qin Yu’s mind.

In this mind, two divine sense sat cross-legged.

One was the already sleeping iron egg, and the other was Qin Yu’s primordial spirit.

This primordial spirit sat cross-legged in the mind, its entire body emitting a golden radiance.

Seeing this strand of divine sense that had intruded, “Qin Yu”slowly stood up.

The corners of his mouth curled up into a sneer. The golden light all over his body made it impossible for people to open their eyes.

“Who told you to come?”Qin Yu asked coldly.

The expression of that strand of divine sense changed drastically! He suddenly understood Qin Yu’s intention!

Qin Yu’s divine sense was already powerful enough to be unafraid of interference! Even if it was drilled into his mind, he could still kill it with a flip of his hand!

“This is bad!”This strand of divine sense knew that things were not good. It turned around and wanted to escape.

However, with a wave of Qin Yu’s large hand, a golden light burst out, completely wiping out this strand of divine sense!

The spell caster in the dark was instantly jolted back a few steps, and a mouthful of blood gushed out from his mouth.

His expression could not help but be a little unsightly, and his face turned extremely pale.

To An Alchemist, divine sense was extremely important.

Although only a strand was killed, it would probably take some time for it to recover.

In this dark little house, su song was frowning as he looked at Qin Yu.

He was frowning because Qin Yu’s pill refinement was not disturbed at all. On the contrary, it was about to take shape.

“What’s going on?”Su Song took a deep breath.

Looking at Qin Yu’s expression again, he was still quite relaxed.

How did this look like he was disturbed?

“What exactly happened...”Su Song could not figure it out for a moment.

“Buzz!”

Just as Su Song was puzzled, the Dragon Cauldron in front of him suddenly flashed with an extremely demonic light!

This light quickly swept out in all directions, and a powerful medicinal fragrance spread out!

At the same time, auspicious clouds began to appear in the sky.

This auspicious cloud was the sign of a heaven rank pill!

“Look, it’s a pill cloud!”Someone exclaimed.

For a moment, everyone in the medicine Saint City raised their heads to look at the large patch of seven-colored auspicious cloud in the sky!

“The medicine Saint Hall has refined another heaven rank pill.”

“That’s right. After all, that is the medicine Saint Hall. They are all top-notch Alchemists.”

“I wonder who this pill cloud came from.”

“Needless to say, it must be the pill refinement king.”

At the highest level of the medicine Saint Hall.

The pill refinement king also raised his head and stared at this large expanse of auspicious clouds.

His face was ashen, his fists were clenched tightly, and his teeth were grinding so hard that cracking sounds could be heard.

“I still let him succeed...”the pill refinement king spat out these few words with great difficulty.

At this moment, he wished that he could kill Qin Yu.

In the pill refinement room.

Qin Yu opened his eyes slightly.

He walked to the front of the Dragon Cauldron and placed this formed nine transformation golden pill in his palm.

“Do you know it?”Qin Yu opened his hand and asked with a smile.

Su Song said with an excited expression, “This... This is really a divine rank pill. You can actually refine a divine rank pill!”

“Why? Are you very disappointed?”Qin Yu ridiculed.

“Even if you want to disturb me, you should find a decent one. Otherwise, you will end up losing everything.”

Su Song’s expression changed drastically!

As expected! That strand of divine sense was killed by Qin Yu!

“You... you...”su song was momentarily speechless.

A moment later, he actually knelt in front of Qin Yu with a plop!

“Mr. Qin, please accept my bow!”Su Song lowered his head, but it was still difficult to hide his respectful feelings.

This made Qin Yu somewhat surprised. He sized up Su Song and said with a smile that was not a smile, “What? Didn’t you stop me in every possible way just now?”

“All of this was against my will. Moreover, I didn’t expect you to really be able to refine a divine rank pill...”Su Song said truthfully.

Qin Yu didn’t know what to say for a moment. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

It could be seen that to these alchemists, the ones they respected would always be the strong.

As long as one’s alchemy skills were strong enough, they would be respected by others.

This was perhaps the reason why the Alchemy King was worried.

“Alright, Can I go up now?”Qin Yu asked.

Su Song hurriedly nodded. “Of course!”

With that, Su Song stood up and planned to bring Qin Yu to the roof personally.

But at this moment, an old man dressed in a white robe suddenly walked down.

He had a genial smile on his face, looking quite benevolent.

He quickly walked in front of Qin Yu and said with a smile, “Young Friend Qin, that Pill Cloud just now was made by you, right?”

Before Qin Yu could say anything, Su Song cupped his hands and said, “Greetings, Alchemy King.”

“You are the Alchemy King?”Qin Yu glanced at him.

The alchemy king smiled faintly and said, “It’s all because my friends gave me face and gave me an undeserved reputation.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Mm, it’s indeed an undeserved reputation.”

The Alchemy King was stunned, and a wave of anger immediately surged in his heart.

However, a warm smile still hung on his face as he said indifferently, “Little Friend Qin, I just happened to have something to do just now, so I didn’t have the time to come down and observe. I’m really sorry.”

Qin Yu said with slight ridicule, “There’s no need for that. You’re a very busy person. What’s more, whether you see or not, I don’t care at all.”

This alchemy king’s magnanimity was extremely small. There was simply no place for someone stronger than him to exist.

Therefore, Qin Yu looked down on him from the bottom of his heart.

The Alchemy King, who already had an extremely small magnanimity, didn’t know what to say at this moment. The anger on his face could no longer be concealed.

“Alright, it’s time for me to go upstairs.”Qin Yu stretched lazily.

Following that, he looked at the alchemy king and said, “I wonder if I can trouble the Alchemy King to personally bring me around for a tour?”

The Alchemy King suppressed his anger and said, “Of course, no problem.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He followed behind the Alchemy King and walked upstairs.

“This second floor...”

“There’s no need to go to the second floor. Let’s go directly to the top floor. I heard that the top-tier herbs are all there,”Qin Yu said.

The Alchemy King was instantly speechless and was so angry that he was trembling.

After arriving at the top floor, Qin Yu immediately smelled a strong medicinal fragrance.

The entire floor had countless rooms, and each room had different herbs placed inside.

Just as the alchemy king was about to introduce them, Qin Yu suddenly stopped in his tracks.

He turned to look at the alchemy king and said indifferently, “I know what you’re thinking. You’re afraid that I’ll Steal Your Limelight and change the title of Alchemy King.”

“But let me tell you today. The reason I’m here is only for the herbs. I’m not interested in the so-called title of Alchemist king at all.”

“So, there’s no need for you to trip me up. Otherwise... I won’t let you off so easily.”
