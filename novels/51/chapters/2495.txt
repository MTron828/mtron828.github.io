2496 The Choice of Saintess

Saintess Gu and him, for example.

“You have to come here because only by having you coming can I do the second thing, to lure Teng Zixu here. I released the power of the restrained breath of the Heart of the Ocean to allow him to detect a trace of your internal qi on purpose. This made him think you had sneaked into the demon race and lured him into the Azure Rock Forest.”

Gu Ning’s voice started to weaken, but she did not stop.

“Immortal Crane injured me severely. I didn’t kill Teng Zixu in the end, but I took a portion of his Heavenly Profound Power. Let this power and the Heart of the Ocean be my Gu family’s apology to you.”

“May I ask why did you bring Saintess Gu in? She could have survived.”

Qin Yu was a little angry. Everything Gu Ning did was calculated.

She even gave the lives of her family members to Qin Yu as a bargaining chip to gain his trust.

“She? Originally, Teng Zixu’s Heavenly Profound Power and the Heart of the Ocean were my parting gifts to her. However, since she chose to die, she probably felt that she could not face you. Therefore, I will give these things to you on her behalf…”

Gu Ning fell silent after she said that.

“Quickly run! Take advantage of the moment when Immortal Crane and Revered Qi are confronting each other. Otherwise, you won’t be able to leave…”

Qin Yu suddenly felt choked up. He finally understood why Saintess Gu ambushed Azure Dragon.

Indeed, as Gu Ning said, she had a high chance of survival.

To ensure her survival, Gu Ning had even given her a drop of the source of poison.

If she were to use it for defense, the four great divine beasts would not dare to approach her in the slightest.

However, she chose to die herself, and this could not help but make Qin Yu feel sad.

It was the family’s order on one hand, but the person she silently missed on the other.

At this moment, in Qin Yu’s soul, wisps of energy that Qin Yu could not pry into squeezed into his soul.

This portion of energy seemed to have changed the structure of his soul from its depths.

After that fusion of that power, Qin Yu suddenly felt that the resonance between his soul and the Path of Heaven had strengthened significantly.

At this moment, he seemed to be able to sense the tremendously distant sea of destruction, although he still could not use its power of the Path of Heaven.

However, he could indeed sense a general direction.

With a divine thought, 30% of his soul reached the sea of space, and the five layers of the power of the origin were immediately activated.

It entered the clone of the soul and then transmitted to Qin Yu’s true body.

He had never been able to activate five layers of power of origin so easily, and this power was even purer than previously.

The space before him suddenly became uneven.

Ten thousand layers of Singularity Space opened up again, but this time, the toughness of each layer was much stronger than before.

In the face of Vermilion Bird’s explosive destructive power, he had actually steadily blocked her full-powered attack.

“Is this the power of the chosen one? No wonder Teng Zixu is so strong.”

Qin Yu sighed with emotion. It was merely a trace of the chosen one’s power, yet it allowed his soul to deepen his comprehension of the Path of Heaven tremendously.

“Boom!”

The nine-tailed fox raised its nine tails, and the nine clusters of energy merged and converged into an energy ball.

An energy ball once again smashed into the Singularity Space beside him, and the space instantly shattered.

Even the Singularity Space could not withstand the consecutive full-power attacks of the two demon kings.

Qin Yu’s body was sent flying by a massive force. The Heart of the Ocean in his body suddenly turned into a stream of energy.

It melted into his blood, and his body turned into a blue light in an instant.

Before all the demon kings could react, he had disappeared in front of them.

Leaving behind the furious demonic beasts, Immortal Crane looked at Qin Yu, who had fled far away.

In the end, he did not make a move. He could not afford to be distracted facing the furious Revered Qi.

Revered Qi snorted coldly and disappeared into the Azure Rock Forest with Teng Zixu.

During the battle in the Azure Rock Forest this time, Azure Dragon, the leader of the four great divine beasts of the demon race, suffered severe injuries.

This ancient Azure Dragon was nearly 9,000 years old, and its strength had already reached the Tribulation Fifth Level.

However, he was defeated by the source of the poison. Not only did the source of the poison severely injure his body, but even his soul had been contaminated with poison.

If Azure Dragon did not have a potent recovery ability, it would probably have died directly in the face of this source of poison.

As for Gu Ning, the head of the Gu family, she had fallen, and Teng Zixu’s cosmic luck had been taken away by one-tenth.

Under the influence of the source of poison, the demon race suffered countless casualties in just half a day.

Even hundreds of thousands of the True Saint demon race were affected, and their cultivation realms dropped.

At this moment, Qin Yu was shuttling through the water element at a tremendous speed. This kind of water escape technique was the most mysterious he had ever seen.

The Heart of the Ocean seemed to have its own magical artifact consciousness, even though he had not refined it yet.

However, the Heart of the Ocean seemed to be executing Gu Ning’s will and brought him out of the Azure Rock Forest.

Furthermore, the power of the wisps of the blue water was healing his injuries at a tremendous speed.

Qin Yu felt somewhat shocked. This Heart of the Ocean was the most terrifying functional magical artifact he had ever seen.

This kind of water escape movement had healing effects.

If used properly, the weak could defeat the strong.

And the terrifying attack power of the source of poison. Qin Yu felt that it had even surpassed the power of the fifth level.

However, this kind of power did not only require the help of the Heart of the Ocean but also a deep comprehension of the water element.

This time, the source of the poison that appeared in the demon race was extracted by Gu Ning after several thousands of years. Ordinary people could not get this kind of poison at all.

Outside the Azure Rock Forest, he could finally see the messaging jade pendant in the Sumeru World.

After meeting up with Ruoxue, who had rushed over, the two rushed toward Huaning Mountain at their fastest speed.

… FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

In Huaning Mountain, after listening to Qin Yu’s entire story, Flower Granny and Lei Xin’s expressions were somewhat complicated. They did not know how to comment on Gu Ning.

If Qin Yu died in the Azure Rock Forest, Saintess Gu would accept Teng Zixu’s Heavenly Profound Power and return to Human Race Watch.

In that case, would Lei Xin and Flower Granny attack the Gu family? Gu Ning was betting that they would not, but she did not expect Saintess Gu to give her hope of survival to Qin Yu.

“D*mn! This time, Teng Zixu’s Heavenly Profound Power was seized by Gu Ning partly because Qin Yu went to the Azure Rock Forest. Will he blame this on Qin Yu?”

Lei Xin’s face suddenly changed as he thought of the most terrifying question.

“But Qin Yu was also tricked into going there. This time, Gu Ning also used him as bait!”

Yan Ruoxue said anxiously.

“Who can testify? The three of us? Even if there’s the slightest chance, they would probably be enraged! With Revered Qi’s strength, if he wants to punish someone, I’m afraid there’s nothing that Human Race Watch can do despite resisting with all its might. When his strength exceeds the fifth level, only people of the same realm can resist it.”

Lei Xin’s expression was hideous.
