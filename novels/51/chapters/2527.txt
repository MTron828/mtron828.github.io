2528 Brilliance of Stars and Moon

Moreover, it was very likely another opportunity for him to break through.

He might be able to unleash unimaginable effects if he could fight with the Brilliance of Stars and Moon as Xiang Yu did.

Qin Yu had already noticed this change during his battle with Si Shiyue.

It was like when he was a fourth-grade True Saint when Teng Zixu’s Borrowing Power from the Heavens was almost unrivaled.

Under the restrictions of the Path of Heaven, the one who could unleash the greatest power would be the ultimate winner.

He wanted to take advantage of this time to increase the power of his limit to the greatest extent, regardless of what method he used.

With the strength of the Gu family’s core disciples, if they could cultivate the Brilliance of Stars and Moon Consonance, they would be the tremendous battle force for Human Race Watch.

“Ruoxue, according to Sister Ji Yue’s information, there are several more suitable places here for you to cultivate. You don’t have to worry. I’m around.”

The strength of the monster race in the Demon Flame Forest should be relatively low, so it was insignificant to Ruoxue. Therefore, there was no need for her to waste time.

“Alright, there are indeed a few places I want to explore. I’ll leave this place to you. Be careful. If there’s anything, send a message to me.”

Yan Ruoxue lightly kissed Qin Yu’s face, but Qin Yu pulled her back before she left.

After kissing her passionately several times, he finally let her go.

After a short rest for a day, everyone headed to the seventh level of purgatory the following day.

However, as they feared attracting attention, they went in batches.

Each batch of about 200 people entered the Demon Flame Forest and began to attack.

In the first few days, they barely encountered any danger.

The demonic beasts in the periphery were not strong. Almost all were equivalent to below the Reversion Void Stage of the human race.

Human Race Watch only suffered minimal casualties. However, as they gradually entered the depths, they began to sense some formidable monster race habitat.

Moreover, they could see human skeletons on the ground along the way. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

At this moment, a large area where the living beings of the monster race dwelled appeared before them.

Behind a dense forest, a burst of revelry of the monster race suddenly sounded.

He directly slashed out and cut the flame spirit into halves.

Nearly a hundred children were tied up and placed on the grill. Their skin and flesh had long been charred black.

Several human race children seemed to be breathing, but their internal organs had long been charred black. There was no way to save them.

This monster race seemed to be roasting them with a gentle fire to ensure they would taste more tender. No one knew what kind of torture these children had suffered before they died!

“D*mn it, these cursed beasts!”

At this moment, regardless of the cultivators from Thunder Courtyard, the members of the Jee family, or the Gu family, they all revealed tremendously terrifying killing intent.

They were silent and took out their magical artifacts one after another before charging toward the flame spirits in celebration.

“Go to hell!”

Countless humans charged in and slaughtered these demonic beasts frantically.

After a short period of chaos, an astonishing demonic qi surged between heaven and earth.

After accumulating for a short while, countless demonic flames erupted from the ground.

As the demonic flames flickered, the distorted head of an evil spirit suddenly materialized. It directly grabbed the neck of a member of the Gu family and twisted his neck into halves.

Following that, a massive flame suddenly surrounded close to 10 members of the Gu family.

Numerous water spells of the Gu family’s immortal scripture instantly blocked it.

However, compared to the raging flames that had fused into one, the power of the water spells of the Gu family’s immortal scripture alone had difficulty resisting this power.

Soon, nearly 10 Gu family members turned into charcoal and fell to the ground.

“This is a kind of ghost-like monster race formed by demonic flames. They can hide in flames and transform and control flames. They are cunning and fatal opponents. Moreover, there are quite a number of them, and almost all of them have the power of the True Saint. It’s a powerful opponent. Should we retreat first?”

Seeing the continuous casualties of the human race, Elder Guai asked hesitantly.

“Although these flame spirits are strong, our strength is not weak either. It’s just that many are fighting individually without any coordination. If they just retreat when they encounter a real enemy, the outcome will be even more cruel when the real war begins.”

Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

His divine sense was fixed on the battlefield, striving to block that fatal attack.

However, the area where the flame spirits were was too vast. It was difficult for him to take care of many places.

Moreover, there was a hidden and powerful internal qi in the depths. That power was tremendously massive.

Gu Wanqing held a flexible sword in her hand. She had already killed countless flame spirits.

However, these flame spirits seem to have shared a connection within the same group, displaying excellent coordination in their joint attacks.

As they fought with all their might, a massive ball of energy suddenly erupted from the ground.

It turned out that powerful living beings had hidden quietly in the surroundings, and they were waiting for Gu Wanqing and the others to enter the encirclement and then completely detonate the demonic flames.

Demonic flames burst out from the ground and surrounded nearly 200 cultivators of the Gu family.

Even though these were the most elite members of the Gu family carrying many supreme treasures with them…

At this moment, their faces were scorched black by the combined demonic flame power. It was difficult to resist.

“You’re courting death!”

Qin Yu was instantly furious. In an instant, Evil Eye’s Yin Yang Road slashed out.

However, in the blink of an eye, a giant flaming palm stretched out from the ground.

After blocking the Yin Yang Road’s slash, the flame giant slowly crawled out of the ground. The terrifying high temperature completely locked onto Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, this is Flame Demon, an evil creature that uses fire as its source of power. Their bodies are burning with raging demonic flames, and they have powerful flame control abilities and ferocious attack methods.”

Elder Guai’s expression changed drastically, and he hurriedly warned.

This was also one of the fiercest living beings of the monster race and had long since reached the fifth level.

At this moment, it directly erupted with terrifying power, not allowing Qin Yu to interfere.

Qin Yu was instantly furious and was about to detonate the soul of Evil Eye.

“Get into formation!”

The peak master realized the danger the Gu family was in at this point and immediately shouted.

The people from the Thunder Courtyard and the Jee family suddenly formed a formation. It was the stance of the cultivation method, the Brilliance of Stars and Moon.
