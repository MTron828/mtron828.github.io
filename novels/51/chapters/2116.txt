2117 Approaching the Sanctums

This time, there was no divine light coming out of his palm. On the contrary, he began to condense a formidable power of a secret technique.

The power of the secret technique gathered in his palm and formed a radiant formation. The formation seemed to have contained endless ways of the Great Dao and the power to destroy everything.

Si Liuhe suddenly raised his hand and cast the formation at the resurrected tomb slaves. The formation expanded in the air like an enormous net, directly covering those tomb slaves.

The moment the formation came into contact with the tomb slaves, their bodies disappeared instantly. Their resurrection ability seemed so powerless in front of this formation.

Seeing this scene, Teng Zixu, who was not far away, narrowed his eyes and said in a low voice, “As expected of Si Liuhe. He actually used the way to wipe out the tomb slaves…”

Si Liuhe’s comprehension just now had succeeded!

Facing the approaching army of tomb slaves, Si Liuhe frowned slightly. Then he waved his hand gently, and the formation slowly floated forward as if it was held by a giant hand.

The formation slowly rotated in the air like an enormous golden chain that gradually covered the tomb slaves in front of it. Every tomb slave that came into contact with the formation seemed to have suffered an irresistible blow. Their bodies immediately began to collapse and then disappeared into the air.

The light of the formation grew increasingly stronger as if it was drawing a beautiful trajectory in the night sky. The tomb slaves that could not resist were crushed by an invisible giant hand and gradually disappeared into the air.

Everyone was shocked and speechless by this scene. They looked at Si Liuhe with awe.

Si Liuhe’s strength was beyond their understanding. The formation he cast with one hand could easily wipe out those tomb slaves. What kind of power was this? How terrifying was it?

At this moment, the light of the formation began to fade slowly, and the tomb slaves all disappeared into the air.

The Chaos Grave was now empty. The place that had been full of tomb slaves was now silent.

Si Liuhe leisurely withdrew his hand. He glanced around the Chaos Grave, then slowly closed his eyes.

“Si Liuhe is so strong!” someone sighed with emotion and said.

“He used the power of a single hand to destroy all the tomb slaves. What kind of strength is this!”

“As expected of a True Saint. His strength has already surpassed the imagination of ordinary people!”

Discussions in the crowd were endless. Everyone was shocked by Si Liuhe’s strength. They knew that they had witnessed a true expert today.

Si Liuhe did not stop there. His gaze finally fell on the nine sanctums!

Everyone was shocked again seeing this!

Could it be that Si Liuhe was going to attack the mysterious living beings in the nine sanctums?

Although the terrifying existence in these sanctums was also bred from the dao technique in the Chaos Grave, it was many times more terrifying than the tomb slaves without intelligence! Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

They had long developed intelligence and guarded the sanctums on their own. Their strength had probably long surpassed the True Saint Realm!

Si Liuhe’s eyes fell on the sanctum in the center. It was like a magnificent palace crafted from an endless galaxy of stars. He narrowed his eyes as if he was figuring out the mysterious power inside.

“What a terrifying internal qi!”

Under this internal qi, everyone felt a strong sense of fear in their hearts! It was a fear that came from the bottom of their hearts!

“Si Liuhe is going to attack!”

“Does he want to take down these sanctums and use them to comprehend the dao technique?”

“Madness! Si Liuhe hasn’t diminished his arrogance from back then!”

Si Liuhe slowly raised his palm, and a terrifying Holy Power instantly rose.

His palm formed a seal, and instantly thousands of dao techniques gathered. That terrifying internal qi resulted in the strange phenomenon in the sanctum!

The moment Si Liuhe raised his hand, the atmosphere in the sanctum became intense!

The magnificent palace that was as if crafted from an endless galaxy of stars suddenly shone brightly. The dazzling starlight seemed to have burned instantly as if stars were falling magnificently and dangerously.

The air in the sanctum seemed to have tensed up as if it was being suppressed by a powerful divine power, making each breathing difficult.

The palace made of stars began to tremble as if it had sensed the terrifying power gathered in Si Liuhe’s hand.

The living beings in the sanctum also sensed this pressure. Their bodies began to tremble slightly as if they were angry because someone was disrespectful!

The power of thousands of dao techniques in Si Liuhe’s palm finally exploded. A dazzling beam of light shot out from the palm of his hand.

Although this beam of light was only the size of a fingertip, it contained the power to destroy everything. It pierced through the air, leaving behind a dazzling path of light as it charged straight toward the stellar palace.

Starlight burst out from the palace made of endless stars as if it was going to set the entire palace ablaze. Then a figure slowly walked out of the palace. The internal qi on his body was majestic as if it contained the power of the entire universe.

Of course, the living beings in the sanctum did not come out. They could not cross the boundaries of the sanctum, but they could use the power of the sanctum to project their consciousness outside the sanctum. This was their ability, and also the method they used to protect the sanctum.

The figure that walked out of the stella palace was a projection. It was ethereal as a human figure condensed from the starlight. His body was full of endless stella power, and his eyes seemed to contain the profoundness of the entire universe.

He raised his hand and pointed at Si Liuhe. Then, his lips moved as if he was saying something. However, his voice did not travel out of the sanctum. Instead, it disappeared from the boundaries of the sanctum.

Si Liuhe looked at the stella figure and narrowed his eyes.

He could tell that the strength of this stella humanoid had far surpassed the tomb slave.

Each of his actions seemed to contain endless dao techniques. It was a power that he had seen before but could not understand.

“As expected of a living being from Wu Ji’s sanctum,” Si Liuhe said indifferently.

At this moment, he felt a hint of pressure but did not stop there. Instead, it stimulated his desire to attack!

“Let me experience it for myself. Although you are not as good as Wu Ji, you’re still a part of Wu Ji’s dao technique…” Si Liuhe grinned widely, revealing a hint of a crazed smile.
