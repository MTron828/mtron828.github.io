2208 Rules Break the Rules

Giant rocks fell on him one after another, but he did not step back at all.

“It’s the power of the way. A mere Early-stage True Saint can actually comprehend such power! No wonder the nine great aristocratic families want to kill you.”

The black pupil constricted, and a killing intent brewed within it.

The largest mountain in the sky suddenly smashed down and crashed onto Qin Yu like a meteor.

The power of destruction surged forth with utmost effort.

Qin Yu’s face flushed red, and his body went limp.

In the next moment, a small portion of the mountain that had not been destroyed smashed onto his body.

“Although the power of the way can drastically reverse the circumstances, it’s not something that the True Saint Realm like you can pry into.”

The pupil chuckled.

Qin Yu stood up with all his might and stared at the black pupil expressionlessly.

The force of deadly silence enveloped the pupil as Qin Yu clenched his fist.

The black pupil suddenly exploded, and a miserable cry sounded from the void.

Immediately after, a tremendously furious and shrill voice exploded in Qin Yu’s ears.

“An ant actually destroyed a wisp of my divine sense!”

As if sensing the black pupil’s anger, the entire space was instantly filled with flashes of lightning and resounding thunder.

Qin Yu was struck by a terrifying force in the void, and his entire body was flung out like a tattered sack.

“If you have the ability… Just kill me, an ant! Trash.”

Qin Yu struggled on the ground for a while and slowly stood up.

Blood filled his eyes. At this moment, he did not want to retreat anymore.

He had retreated numerous times since he came from Earth. This time, even if he was facing such a powerful opponent, he did not want to back off.

“Ha! I will make you beg me to kill you!”

A miserable cry came from the pupil.

“Boom!”

A lightning bolt, resembling a gigantic thunderbolt with a span of hundreds of feet, suddenly struck down with great force. In an instant, the entire space that had been changed by the way returned to its original appearance.

The scene of the tsunami and landslide no longer existed as if it had just been a dream.

If not for the bloody corpses on the street and the cruel battle that had just taken place.

Like liquid, the lightning bolt turned into a lightning dragon and appeared before the black pupil.

“I didn’t suppress my cultivation realm just now. Did I attract the Path of Heaven?”

The black pupil said coldly.

“Even if the Path of Heaven comes, it can’t save you today!”

The black pupil turned into a black light and slashed into Qin Yu’s divine sense like a giant sword.

Wu Ji’s robe trembled wildly at this moment, and a phantom blocked in front of the black dagger.

The Venerable Fifth Mountain appeared in Qin Yu’s divine sense, blocking the black dagger with the robe.

An unprecedented sense of danger appeared in Qin Yu’s mind.

Qin Yu did not hesitate at all. The golden figurine of his divine sense emitted the greatest light and headed toward the black dagger.

“Rip!”

The robe and the Venerable Fifth Mountain were almost instantly destroyed, but they blocked most of the divine sense energy.

After that, the black dagger and Qin Yu’s golden figurine collided fiercely. Qin Yu instantly felt the world before his eyes split into two.

An excruciating pain that was hundreds of times more painful than scraping bones and flesh came from his divine sense. The golden figurine almost split into two halves. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Senior, board the ship!”

A gigantic warship rushed out. It was the warship of the Yun family that was rushing toward him.

Before he set off, he had already sent a message via divine sense to Yun Qingyun. He did not expect Yun Qingyun to take such a big risk.

Qin Yu stepped onto the warship.

“Go to the purgatory!”

Qin Yu let out his last cry and lost consciousness.

“Where’re you heading?”

The black pupil roared.

At this moment, a door of light appeared in the void behind the black pupil.

A shadow of light appeared at the door.

“Did I accidentally use the power of the Tribulation Transcendence Stage and attract the Guardian?”

The black pupil had a drastic change in expression.

At this moment, he could no longer care about Qin Yu. The black pupil turned into a mist and disappeared into the void.

The shadow of light that appeared stared indifferently at the distant void and raised his hand and gently tap.

“Boom!”

The space suddenly distorted and compressed into a black sphere like bread.

After that, the shadow of light stared thoughtfully in the direction Qin Yu had left. In the next moment, it disappeared into the door of light.

A gigantic figure stood up at the spot where they had been just now.

“This battle actually destroyed two wisps of my divine sense. Qin Yu, it’s hard to appease the hatred in my heart if I don’t kill you.”

As he was angry, the warm weather suddenly changed. Thick smoke billowed, and sand and stones flew.

“Hehehe, Xing Xiu, I heard that you can’t even handle a cultivator of True Saint Realm. As this person is getting older, he has become wiser and shrewder.”

An enormous divine sense flew over and stopped not far from Xing Xiu.

“If it weren’t for the appearance of the Guardian, he would have died for sure. However, he was hit by my divine sense, so he’s no different from a cripple.”

Xing Xiu said coldly.

“Xing Xiu is in such a sorry state. Hahaha, your divine sense is damaged. I’m afraid when the heavenly tribulation arrives, you’ll shatter into pieces.”

The voice laughed wildly, completely ignoring Xing Xiu, whose expression was extremely ugly.

“Get lost!”

Xing Xiu shouted angrily and directly slapped the divine sense away.

“Do you think you can survive by going to the purgatory?”

Xing Xiu said calmly.

In a Mystic Realm with harmonious weather, the common people lived in peace and contentment. Children played and made noise, creating a serene and tranquil scene.

A person stepped in, and everywhere he went, corpses were strewn all over the ground.

The long sword in his hand mercilessly stabbed into the bodies of the people along the way. His robe was covered in blood, and blood flowed like a river below him.

“No!”

The moment he turned around, Qin Yu almost suffocated.

That was the face that resembled him at a glance. This person was Qin Yu.

“Stop!”

“You can’t stop me!”

That person smiled evilly and swept his sword.

“Stop!”

Qin Yu got up abruptly, cold sweat dripping down his forehead.

“Brother Qin, you’re awake?”

Yun Qingyun asked, blinking her big eyes.

“Hmm, where’s this place?”

Qin Yu could faintly smell sulfur in his breath. The air was unbearably hot, and the spiritual energy in the space was almost invisible.

“This place is purgatory. Didn’t you transmit and tell Qingyun to come here?”

Uncle Qun’s face was a little ugly.

This was purgatory. The Purgatory Formation that Hei Yun and the three great aristocratic families had used to attack him should have been created from this place. Moreover, Wang Feng had deduced the nine trigrams of destiny for him, and this was the only place he could avoid danger.

Presumably, something was special about this place.

As Qin Yu was in deep thought, an enormous lake below the warship suddenly rippled a few times. Immediately after, a giant crocodile hundreds of feet long suddenly shot out like an arrow and ruthlessly slammed onto the warship.

Everyone on the warship staggered, and Yun Qingyun almost fell out. Fortunately, Qin Yu caught hold of her.

“Demonic Beast! Poisonous crocodile! Its claws and teeth were poisonous.”

Uncle Qun roared.

“It’s just a Reversion Void Stage Demonic Beast. Let me deal with it!”

Yun Fengqing pulled out a long sword and swung it at the poisonous crocodile.

There was a crisp sound of metal colliding.
