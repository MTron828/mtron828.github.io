Chapter 1054: Chapter 1,054, Peak Battle Sage! 

Both sides suffered heavy casualties in this battle.

At least a hundred people from the Heaven Gate had died. If Qin Yu had not returned in time, many more would have died.

After returning to the main hall, the remaining heaven gate disciples began to clean up the battlefield.

Qin Yu, Immortal Crane Jiang He, and the others sat cross-legged together.

“This is Lord Immortal Crane,”Qin Yu took the initiative to introduce them.

Jiang he and the others stood up to greet him, but immortal crane, who disliked humans by nature, ignored them and just sat there without saying a word.

It wasn’t just immortal crane, Uncle Niu and the others were the same.

Qin Yu was also helpless and could only wink at Jiang he and the others.

“Call us when you set off.”At this moment, immortal crane suddenly stood up and turned to leave.

After he left, Qin Yu helplessly explained, “They are all demon beasts, so they naturally don’t have a good impression of human cultivators.”

“Demon Beasts? So Many Demon Beasts?”Jiang he couldn’t help but be a little surprised.

“Qin Yu, how did you get to know so many demon beasts?”Xu Huaigu also asked.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “It’s a long story. In short, they are here to help us.”

“I really didn’t expect that the second Mystic Realm would take the initiative to attack.”

“Yeah, and they brought so many people.”

“It seems that the second mystic realm can’t sit still anymore.”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “That’s good too. In a few days, I will bring people to attack the second mystic realm.”

The news of this battle quickly spread. The death of 1,000 martial marquis in the second mystic realm could be said to be a shock to the world.

Although it was a golden age, the Martial Marquis realm was as rare as phoenix feathers and qilin horns.

Any one of them could become the overlord of a region.

But in this battle, more than 1,000 martial marquis had died. It was simply shocking.

On the other side, the surviving martial marquis staggered back to the second secret realm.

He knelt in front of Gu Zizhen and said in a trembling voice, “They’re all dead. Our people are all dead!”

“What!”

Gu Zizhen suddenly stood up and said angrily, “How could this be! All of the One Thousand Martial Marquis are dead? where is Chi Hou?”

“Lord Chi Hou... he was killed by Qin Yu!”The Martial Marquis said in terror.

Zhai Xing seemed to have expected this. His face was somewhat sorrowful, but he didn’t say a word.

Gu Zizhen sat on the chair, his face terrifyingly cold.

“This Qin Yu... I won’t forgive him!”Gu Zizhen slapped the table.

At this moment, the martial marquis kneeling in front of him suddenly exploded and died!

Blood splattered everywhere and splashed onto Gu Zizhen’s face!

Then, a shadow flew out from between Gu Zizhen’s eyebrows.

This shadow was none other than Qin Yu!

Qin Yu stayed in the air and looked around as if he was sizing up the structure of the palace.

“TSK TSK, your place is not bad.”Qin Yu looked at Gu Zizhen and sneered.

Gu Zizhen narrowed his eyes and said in a cold voice, “You are Qin Yu?”

“You are Gu Zizhen? We finally meet.”Qin Yu sneered.

Gu Zizhen suddenly stood up and shouted, “Kid, you killed a thousand of my martial marquis. You Are Really Vicious!”

“This is just the beginning,”Qin Yu said with a dark face.

“Wait for me to kill my way in. The second secret realm will definitely be filled with people!”

These words were meant for Gu Zizhen to hear, but also for Zhai Xing.

“Gu Zizhen, wait in the second secret realm. In a few days, I will bring people to take your dog head,”Qin Yu said with a cold smile.

Gu Zizhen waved his hand and erased this trace of divine sense.

His face was terrifyingly cold, and the murderous aura on his body was extremely shocking.

No one in the entire hall dared to say anything, afraid that this anger would descend on them.

This time, the second secret realm’s face was completely lost.

Not only did they fail to take down the Heaven Gate, but they were also massacred. If this news were to spread, they would definitely be ashamed of themselves.

...

In the next few days, Qin Yu told everyone about the second secret realm he controlled.

“There are at least 10,000 martial marquis in the second secret realm. They all work for the GU family and control the joint secret technique,”Qin Yu said.

“Besides the martial marquis, they also have several martial saints, an unknown spiritual artifact, and a peak martial saint, Gu Zizhen.”

“We might not be able to win in a fight,”Jiang he said.

Qin Yu grunted and continued, “Therefore, the purpose of this expedition is not to win. As long as we see Zhai Xing, we will have completed our mission.”

Great battles were often fraught with anxiety. It was impossible to win in one go.

Xianhe, who had been silent, suddenly said, “You can leave Gu Zizhen to me.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “No need. I will personally take care of Gu Zizhen.”

“He is at the peak of the Martial Saint Realm. Can you do it?”The Immortal Crane raised its eyebrows. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Qin Yu stood up and said, “Not to mention the peak of the martial saint realm, even if he is at the Almighty Realm, I still want to try.”

Seeing this, the immortal crane did not say anything more.

Three days later, all the disciples of the Heaven Gate gathered at the entrance of the martial arts association in Jingdu.

Hundreds of people surrounded the entire martial arts association of Jingdu.

The surrounding crowd was discussing in low voices, and some people immediately chose to join the Heaven Gate.

Qin Yu was like a general who was about to go on an expedition. He stood on a high place and gave the highest order of the Heaven Gate.

“Everyone, listen up. Go to the second secret realm!”Qin Yu waved his hand. In an instant, hundreds of people were like tigers out of a cage, instantly shattering the martial arts association of Jingdu!

They went straight to the entrance of the second mystic realm. As the entrance opened, everyone charged into the second mystic realm!

Immortal Crane and Qin Yu stood outside without moving for a long time.

“Qin Yu, don’t forget the purpose of this trip. What I want is to enter the first mystic realm and find the ancient array platform,”said immortal crane.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Don’t worry. I’m also very interested in this ancient array platform.”

Xianhe hummed in gratitude. He didn’t say anything else and strode into the secret realm.

The few of them entered the second secret realm together. The entrance to the secret realm slowly closed again.

Now, the Martial Arts Association of Jingdu no longer had any dignity to speak of. Many people ran in and stood at the exit to watch.

Xia hang looked at this scene and couldn’t help but sigh slightly.

“I’m afraid the Martial Arts Association of Jingdu is going to become history.”

Before he could finish his words, auspicious clouds suddenly flashed in the sky!

“HMM? It’s the martial saint’s auspicious clouds!”Someone exclaimed.

“Is someone going to step into the martial saint realm again?”

The auspicious clouds quickly dispersed. Then, the Heavenly Tribulation suddenly arrived!

“Indeed, someone is going to step into the martial saint realm.”

“From this direction, it seems to be the Yan family! Could it be that Yan Jinyao is going to step into the Martial Saint Realm?”

Just as everyone guessed, at this moment, in the Yan family’s courtyard, Yan Jinyao was getting ready to face the heavenly tribulation!

“It’s finally my turn!”Yan Jinyao’s face revealed a crazed expression.

“I have the combined bloodline of the Yan family and Qin Yu. The invincible one must be me!”
