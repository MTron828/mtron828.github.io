Chapter 1183: Chapter 1,183, lost all of his spiritual energy 

At this moment, Qin Yu was prostrating on the ground like an old man who was already in his twilight years.

Wrinkles appeared on his face, and his internal organs seemed to be aging!

“Ah! !”

Qin Yu looked at the white hair that drifted over, and his heart suddenly felt sorrowful!

He never expected that this trip to the sacred mausoleum would pay such a huge price!

To anyone, the passing of youth was extremely painful, and so was Qin Yu.

He simply could not believe that he had turned from a young man into an old man!

“How could this be...”Qin Yu grabbed his white hair, his heart filled with extreme pain and despair.

Tears welled up in his eyes, as if he could not believe what was happening before his eyes.

However, Qin Yu was an extremely rational person. Even under such circumstances, he quickly calmed down.

No matter how much pain he felt, it could not change anything. He could only force his body to continue climbing towards the bronze coffin!

His lifespan was still draining away, but Qin Yu’s body seemed to have reached the peak of aging. There was no more change, only the wrinkles on his face had become thicker.

After climbing with difficulty for more than ten minutes, Qin Yu finally managed to get close to the bronze coffin.

He grabbed the bronze coffin with one hand and climbed up from the ground with difficulty.

The terrifying pressure came at him in an instant, crushing Qin Yu’s body until it cracked.

The true body of green wood burst out with light, covering every inch of Qin Yu’s skin.

However, it was obvious that the green wood true body could not withstand it for too long. Therefore, Qin Yu did not dare to waste any more time. He gritted his teeth and used all his strength to move the bronze coffin away.

The instant the coffin was opened, strands of even more powerful holy might spread out.

The green wood true body could not withstand it anymore and directly exploded!

“Pu!”

The terrifying holy might suddenly came over, and Qin Yu suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood! His chest was in pain!

Qin Yu held onto the bronze coffin tightly. He stretched out his hand and reached into the coffin.

There was a corpse inside the coffin. The corpse seemed to be intact, and time did not leave any traces on its body.

It was a tall man with sword-like eyebrows and starry eyes. Although it was just a corpse, one could still feel the aura of him looking down on the world!

Other than this corpse, Qin Yu also found a huge brush in the bronze coffin.

“Holy Weapon?”Qin Yu’s eyes suddenly lit up!

There was indeed a holy weapon hidden in this coffin!

This brush was 30 centimeters long and several centimeters thick. Although it had been shelved for many years, it still emitted a bright radiance.

The entire brush looked extremely huge. It was more like a horsetail whisk than a brush. It was almost the same size as a horsetail whisk.

Other than the corpse and the brush saint weapon, there was nothing else.

Qin Yu originally wanted to take the corpse away, but with his current state, it was impossible for him to take the brush away.

Not only did his body lose his spiritual energy, even his main body’s strength was exhausted.

Qin Yu tried a few times to move the bronze coffin, but in the end, he failed.

Seeing that his lifespan was still running out, Qin Yu could not afford to waste any more time. If he did not leave now, he might really become a skeleton in the sacred mausoleum.

“What a pity.”Qin Yu secretly gritted his teeth. He put away the brush and turned around to climb out.

At this moment, Qin Yu could no longer stand up. He could only force himself to climb out.

The further away he was from the bronze coffin, the less pressure the holy might exerted, and the stale air also began to disappear.

Qin Yu’s head was covered in sweat. His hair had completely turned snow-white, and the wrinkles on his face were becoming more and more obvious.

Seeing that he was getting closer and closer to the stone door, the holy might also began to slowly disappear. The pressure lingering on Qin Yu’s body could already be ignored.

He stood up from the ground and walked out of the stone door.

Outside the door.

Chang Mang and Lu Guan did not leave. They just stood there and waited quietly.

Looking at Qin Yu who walked out of the sacred mausoleum, they did not recognize him for a moment.

At this time, Qin Yu’s appearance had changed drastically. His snow-white long hair hung down his shoulders. Coupled with his long black clothes, it made him look extremely mysterious.

“Qin Yu? !”Chang Mang rubbed his eyes and was the first to recognize this person.

He quickly ran in front of Qin Yu and said with a worried expression, “You... What Happened to you? Why did your hair... why did your hair turn white?”

Qin Yu opened his mouth, not even knowing how to explain.

“It’s the Twilight Qi. Under the influence of the Twilight Qi, more than half of his lifespan has been consumed,”Lu Yun said quietly.

“What do you mean?”Chang Mang’s expression changed, and he hurriedly turned to look at Lu Yun.

Lu Yun said expressionlessly, “I mean it literally. The current Qin Yu is probably already in his old age.”

Old Age!

These two words deeply Stung Qin Yu’s heart.

However, he was very clear in his heart that what Lu Yun said was right. Even his body had undergone changes. God knows how much of his lifespan had been consumed.

“Then... then what should we do? Do you guys have any ideas?”Chang Mang asked hurriedly.

Lu Yun said, “We do have some ideas. If we absorb the vitality, we still have a chance to extend our lifespan.”

When he said this, Lu Yun changed the topic and continued, “However, you don’t have to worry too much. A martial saint has at least several hundred years. Even if his lifespan is absorbed, he can still live for at least another hundred years.”

Qin Yu did not say a word, but he felt sorrow in his heart.

Qin Yu had probably spent more than half of his time on the trip to the Saint Mausoleum. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The price for this saint weapon was too high.

“Since your lifespan has been used up, your spiritual power must have been depleted a long time ago.”At this moment, Lu Guan suddenly said indifferently.

Qin Yu’s gaze was like a torch as he looked at Lu Guan.

“So?”Qin Yu asked coldly.

Lu Guan squinted his eyes and said, “Without spiritual power, you are useless! I advise you to hand over your Babe, or don’t blame me for being rude!”
