Chapter 1435: Chapter 1,435, nascent Soul Stage 1

Rays of light like the afterglow of the Sun appeared on Qin Yu’s body.

Qin Yu closed his eyes and felt the heat coming from all over his body.

At this moment, the number on his forehead slowly disappeared.

His flat forehead reappeared.

His black hair was like a waterfall that fell on his shoulders. Under the golden contrast, he looked like a god.

Qin Yu stood up from the ground. He took a deep breath and said in a low voice, “Finally, the twilight aura has finally disappeared.”

After saying that, Qin Yu closed his eyes and felt the long-lost spiritual power in his body.

Traces of spiritual power slowly circulated in Qin Yu’s body.

“Finally, finally...”Qin Yu was so excited that tears filled his eyes. He unconsciously half-knelt on the ground. Two lines of clear tears flowed out of his eyes.

This was the feeling of possessing spiritual power. The surrounding spiritual energy made Qin Yu feel comfortable both physically and mentally.

“Eh?”

At this moment, Qin Yu noticed something unusual.

He felt the spiritual power in his body and found that there was very little spiritual power in his body, far less than before he was infected with the Twilight Qi.

“What’s going on?”Qin Yu’s face was a little ugly.

Could it be that the damage left by the Twilight Qi was irreversible?

Even if she consumed the life Qi to recover, would it permanently affect her spiritual power?

“That’s not right.”Qin Yu shook his head.

Previously, after Zhao Wan ‘er recovered her spiritual power, there were no sequelae, so there shouldn’t be any problems with Qin Yu.

“Perhaps she will recover in a while,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Therefore, he didn’t continue to think about it. No matter what, Qin Yu had indeed recovered his spiritual power.

He raised his head and looked at the sky. Then, his body shook and he floated in the air.

Qin Yu stood high in the sky and looked down at the divine capital city. A smile appeared on his face.

Then, Qin Yu raised his palm and aimed at a certain uninhabited place.

He gently slapped his palm forward, and a huge palm crushed forward.

“Boom!”

The ground instantly collapsed, stirring up a hundred thousand feet of dust!

“Hahahahaha!”Seeing this, Qin Yu could not help but raise his head and laugh loudly.

This was the feeling that a true cultivator should have!

Although this palm strike was extremely powerful, the only pity was that with just one palm strike, the spiritual energy in Qin Yu’s body was completely depleted.

He lowered his head and looked at his hands. He could not help but frown and say, “The spiritual power in just one palm strike was empty. If this was in a big battle, I’m afraid it would be of no use.”

After thinking about it, Qin Yu felt that it might be because his spiritual power had just recovered. It would take a certain amount of time.

Therefore, Qin Yu did not think further. He turned around and returned to the divine capital city.

In the divine capital city, there were already people who had prepared accommodations for Qin Yu.

They had built a huge and magnificent palace in the center of the divine capital city.

Although this palace could not be compared to the Wen family’s manor, it was still too extravagant for Qin Yu.

“I have never received such treatment before...”Qin Yu looked at the huge castle and could not help but be surprised.

“City Lord, the palaces in every city represent the city’s face. We can not be careless,”said an elder beside him.

Qin Yu looked at the old man and said, “Did you plan all of this?”

The old man said with some pride, “Yes, I planned the entire city.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh, “How can I, Qin Yu, do that...”

“You can’t say that. If it weren’t for you, we might have become prisoners of the Heavenly Cloud Sect,”said the old man.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but think to himself that he had no intention of becoming a willow tree.

“What’s Your Name?”Qin Yu looked at the old man.

The old man cupped his hands and said, “I’m Peng Liu. City Lord, you can call me old Liu.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I’ll Call You Peng Liu. In the future, this divine capital city will have to rely on you more.”

To Qin Yu, he didn’t want to be a city lord at all. This place was just a sanctuary.

And now, Qin Yu did not need a sanctuary. He might come to the divine capital city to cultivate in seclusion in the future. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“City Lord, you... have your spiritual power recovered?”

At this moment, Peng Liu suddenly asked.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “Yes, it has just recovered.”

Upon hearing that, Peng Liu immediately cupped his hands and said, “Congratulations, City Lord! I wish that city lord can pull out the heavenly cloud sect as soon as possible!”

Qin Yu smiled and shook his head, not saying anything else.

“City lord, your cultivation... seems to be only at the nascent Soul Realm?”At this moment, Peng Liu seemed to have noticed something.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Why, are you very surprised?”

Peng Liu said with a face full of shock, “Not only surprised, I simply... have nothing to say!”

“Previously, someone had guessed your strength and said that you might be at the peak of a mighty figure who had lost his spiritual power. I never expected that you were only at the nascent Soul Realm...”

Qin Yu raised his head and sighed. That’s right, there was still a thin line between him and the Almighty Realm.

If it wasn’t for the Twilight Poison, he wouldn’t be in this state.

The current Qin Yu could indeed cross ranks to fight, but if he met a true genius, it was hard to say who would win.

For example, Chang Mang, or that Xiao Yuan.

If they were at the same level, Qin Yu didn’t dare to guarantee that he could beat them. Moreover, their current cultivation was definitely above Qin Yu’s.
