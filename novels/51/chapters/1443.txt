Chapter 1444: Chapter 1444, absolute beginning Sacred Fist! 1

He struggled with all his might and used all the spells he had learned in his life in an instant.

But even so, it was useless.

His body was still out of control and floated towards Qin Yu.

In an instant, the protector was forcefully sucked in front of Qin Yu.

“Do you want to die?”

Qin Yu’s cold voice echoed in his ears.

This voice was like a life-threatening talisman, making people tremble in fear.

“Don’t... Don’t kill me!”The protector wailed. In the next second, Qin Yu directly crushed his head.

His corpse was thrown on the ground. Qin Yu’s body was also stained with blood.

Golden and blood-red colors mixed together, making Qin Yu look like a god of death.

Not far away, the Great Elder’s face turned ashen. He knew that Qin Yu was so powerful that it was unbelievable.

“Little Bastard...”the great elder murmured. Then, a huge disk image appeared behind him.

It was like a sun hanging behind him. The power was heavy and pure, vigorous and agile.

“It’s the first elder’s disk phenomenon. It’s his trump card.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“He forced the first elder to such a state with just one punch?”

“What’s the background of this Qin Yu? He’s so terrifying!”

Everyone was discussing in low voices. Their bodies were also emitting light.

This light was used to protect their bodies to prevent them from being attacked by the disk phenomenon.

“I finally took it out.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh coldly when he saw this scene.

With Qin Yu’s current condition, he couldn’t hold on for too long.

If the first elder didn’t use this technique, Qin Yu wouldn’t be able to deal with it after a while.

The disk phenomenon grew bigger and bigger, and the terrifying light covered the sky.

Traces of a heavy aura descended from the disk phenomenon.

This disc anomaly was many times stronger than Ling Yun’s!

“Little Bastard, I’ll kill you today!”The Great Elder said sinisterly.

His voice was like a volcano that was about to erupt.

Buzz

Qin Yu’s body emitted a golden glow.

This golden glow was the third level of the saintly being technique!

“What Bullsh * t disc phenomenon? Watch me crush him with one punch!”Qin Yu said coldly.

The disc behind the first elder exploded and instantly hung above Qin Yu’s head.

Then, the phenomenon crushed towards Qin Yu with an extremely strong pressure!

Before the disc arrived, the ground had already shattered and cracks appeared!

This was the evolution of the first Elder’s Dao Arts for his entire life. It was incomparably terrifying. In the entire South Province, not many people could contend against it!

However, Qin Yu did not show any signs of panic at this moment. His body was emitting an extremely dazzling golden light as he erupted with an incomparable battle intent!

Rumble..

The circular plate came crushing towards Qin Yu. The powerful force tore all of Qin Yu’s clothes into pieces!

Qin Yu raised his head to look at the strange phenomenon on the circular plate. The smile on his face became even wider.

“Absolute beginning... Sacred Fist!”

At this moment, Qin Yu raised his head and roared. The iron fist instantly turned into a blazing golden color!

Under this pure radiance, it was almost impossible to see the outline of the Fist clearly. All that could be seen was a golden speck of light!

“Break!”

Qin Yu rose up from the ground and faced the difficulty head-on. His fist actually directly smashed towards the strange phenomenon on the disk!

“Boom!”

Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, Qin Yu’s fist finally collided with the circular phenomenon!

At this moment, a wave of heat rushed towards his face, rapidly surging in all directions!

The surrounding space collapsed in large swaths, revealing a pitch-black void.

Meanwhile, the displacement guild behind him automatically activated a killing formation, protecting the displacement guild!

The surrounding mountain peaks were directly reduced to ruins. In an instant, sand and stones flew everywhere, and the sky and earth turned dark!

Those who were weaker were directly reduced to a bloody mist. After that, the bloody mist was evaporated by the heat wave, disappearing without a trace!

“Ah! ! !”

Qin Yu roared angrily, and his fist exploded with extreme power!

In the next second, the round plate phenomenon began to shake. In a moment, it exploded like a bomb!

At this moment, everyone’s eyes were pierced by the white light and they covered their eyes!

“What happened? who won?”

“Why did the disc suddenly explode? Could it be that it couldn’t take it anymore?”

Finally, the white light slowly dissipated and everyone hurriedly opened their eyes.

They saw a figure standing in the air.

The clothes on his body had been completely shattered, revealing an extremely familiar body.

This body was not considered strong, but it possessed an extremely strong masculine charm!

And that figure was none other than Qin Yu!

The disc phenomenon had long disappeared without a trace, leaving only the void that was slowly healing in the air.

Qin Yu looked coldly in the direction of the first elder and said, “Is this your trump card? It’s only so-so.”

This was only the absolute beginning holy fist, and it was not Qin Yu’s self-created fist that could break all techniques!

Even so, the disc phenomenon was still shattered by Qin Yu’s punch!

The first Elder’s face stiffened. At this moment, his face was completely gone.

“This little bastard...”the first elder gritted his teeth.

Although he did not want to believe it, he knew very well in his heart that he was no longer Qin Yu’s match.
