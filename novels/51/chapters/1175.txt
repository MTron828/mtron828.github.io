Chapter 1176: Chapter 1,176. That was all there was to it 

The two exchanged a glance and immediately turned to leave.

Heaven Gate.

These two people from the holy region had suddenly descended.

“So this is the Heaven Gate?”The woman looked down at the enormous sect and couldn’t help but be slightly surprised.

“You dare to call it the Heaven Gate? How arrogant.”The man snorted lightly.

“Alright, let’s not waste any more time. If someone from another sect arrives, the ancient sage tomb might fall into someone else’s hands,”the woman said.

The two didn’t say anything else and strode into the Heaven Gate.

The sudden arrival of the two strangers naturally attracted a lot of attention.

Zhen Yue hurriedly walked out of the hall. Looking at the two people in front of her, she asked politely, “May I know who you are?”

“We are from the Saint Realm,”the man said indifferently.

Saint Realm!

Hearing this, Zhen Yue turned pale with fright!

She hurriedly cupped her hands and said, “Greetings, seniors!”

Seeing Zhen Yue’s attitude, the two people seemed to be quite satisfied.

“Please take a seat,”Zhen Yue cupped her hands and said.

After welcoming the two people into the main hall, she asked someone to serve them tea.

“Please Wait a moment. I’ll go find our sect master now,”Zhen Yue said politely.

Then, Zhen Yue quickly walked out of the main hall. She took out her cell phone and dialed Qin Yu’s number.

At this moment, Qin Yu was in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, telling Fang Yue about the past.

He took out the list and said in a low voice, “I should help Li Yu kill his Master Tomorrow.”

At this moment, Qin Yu’s cell phone rang.

As soon as the call was connected, Zhen Yue’s voice came from the other end.

“Mr. Qin, the people from the saint realm are here!”Zhen Yue’s voice was filled with anxiety and excitement.

Hearing this, Qin Yu suddenly stood up and said in surprise, “The people from the Saint Realm? Where are they?”

“They’re at our Heaven Gate,”Zhen Yue said.

“Okay, tell them to wait for a while. I’ll go back immediately.”

After saying this, Qin Yu hurriedly got up and prepared to go back to the Heaven Gate.

“Why? Are you going to leave me alone?”Fang Yue teased.

Qin Yu was a little embarrassed and said, “Then come with me.”

With Fang Yue in tow, Qin Yu sped toward the Heaven Gate.

Inside the Heaven Gate, a man and a woman were secretly releasing their divine sense to cover the entire heaven gate.

A moment later, the man snorted and said, “Most of the cultivators here are only at the Martial Marquis or Great Grandmaster realm. The strongest one is only at the early-stage of the martial saint realm, so it’s not worth mentioning.”

“It seems that the elder is right. The Spiritual Qi here is exhausted, so it’s not suitable for cultivation anymore,”the woman continued.

This undoubtedly made them even more arrogant, and their attitude toward Zhen Yue and the others had obviously changed.

“Is your sect master still not back yet? Why? Does he not value us?”The man glanced at Zhen Yue and asked.

Zhen Yue’s expression slightly changed, and she hurriedly bowed and said, “Seniors, don’t be anxious. Our sect master is out of town, and he’ll be back soon.”

“If he doesn’t come back soon, we’ll go somewhere else,”the woman said indifferently.

Zhen Yue’s expression changed drastically. He said with some fear, “Seniors, please wait for a while. I... I’ll go and urge the sect master again.”

Seeing Zhen Yue’s attitude, the two burst into laughter again.

Such a humble attitude would not bring them closer to each other. On the contrary, it would make people look down on them even more.

When they had enough power, all the relationships would come closer to them.

At this moment, Qin Yu came through the gate with Fang Yue.

As soon as he entered the gate, Qin Yu found a man and a woman beside him.

“Mr. Qin, you’re finally back.”Zhen Yue hurried forward. “These two seniors are waiting anxiously.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. He walked to the two and said in a neither servile nor overbearing manner, “I’m really sorry. I didn’t know that you were here. Please forgive me for the delay.”

The man looked at Qin Yu up and down and asked, “Are you the sect master of the Heaven Gate?”

“Yes.”Qin Yu sat on the side and waved his hand. “Look at the tea.”

Qin Yu’s attitude was different from Zhen Yue’s, which made the two of them slightly unhappy.

“I heard that Your Heaven Gate is the number one sect in the world. So, you are the number one person in the world?”The Woman Sized Qin Yu up and said.

Before Qin Yu opened his mouth, the disciple beside him said proudly, “Our sect master is indeed the number one person in the world. He just killed one not long ago...”

Before he could finish his words, Qin Yu waved his hand and said humbly, “It’s just an empty title.”

“I think you are also an empty title. The number one person in the world is only at the intermediate stage of the Martial Saint Stage?”The Man’s face carried a trace of ridicule.

Qin Yu glanced at him and realized that this person’s strength was only at the advanced stage of the martial saint stage, the same level as Zhai Xing.

However, Qin Yu did not say much. Instead, he went straight to the point and asked, “When are we going to the Saint Stage? We already have a lot of people waiting here.”

“Go to the Holy Region?”When this topic was brought up, the man and woman looked at each other, then, they said in a strange tone, “The reason why the Holy Region is called the holy region is because it’s a holy land. Not everyone can go there. They have to go through a selection.”

“That’s right. Our Holy Region doesn’t accept trash.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly, feeling a little unhappy.

But thinking about it carefully, he was right. The journey was so far, they couldn’t bring too many people. Naturally, they had to choose the best.

“Then when will the selection begin?”Qin Yu continued to ask.

“No rush, no rush.”The man waved his hand.

He slowly stood up and said indifferently, “Let me introduce myself first. My name is Lu Guan, and this is my senior sister Lu Yun. The two of us are here under the orders of the elders to extradite the fated person and to look for a few items.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Upon hearing this name, Qin Yu immediately spat out the water he had just drunk.

Lu Guan frowned slightly and said with some displeasure, “What’s wrong with you?”

Qin Yu coughed dryly and said, “It’s nothing. Do people in your place always have such special names?”

“What special names?”Lu Guan said with a dark face.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Let’s get down to business.”

Lu Guan snorted coldly and continued, “This time, it’s up to the two of us to decide who can go and who can’t. To put it bluntly, it’s just a word from the two of us.”

Although his words were obscure, the meaning was very obvious.

Whoever could please them would be the first to go to the holy region.

As expected, the world was as Black as crows.

“Right, before that, we need to find something. We are short of manpower for the time being. Let Your Heaven Gate send people out.”Lu Guan returned to the main topic.
