1953 Si Shifeng, I’m Coming!

Seeing Uncle Yan being prudent and serious, Qin Yu suddenly had a very bad feeling.

It was not good news to be kept on Xihuang Island by the third princess or to be exposed to the Yan family.

The third princess looked at Uncle Yan and couldn’t help but sneer.”You wish! Unless you bring Yao Xi to me, I will not agree to anything else!”

Uncle Yan was silent. For a moment, he didn’t seem to know what to do.

!!

The woman in front of him was the third princess, after all. No matter how powerful Uncle Yan was, he would not dare to do anything to her.

“Third Princess, is there really no room for negotiation?” Uncle Yan asked in a deep voice.

“No, absolutely not!” the third princess snorted coldly and said.

Before she could finish her words, another person appeared on Xihuanf Island.

This person was none other than Yan Ruoxue.

Yan Ruoxue’s appearance immediately caused the expressions of everyone on Xihuang Island to change. Even Uncle Yan also frowned.

If they somewhat feared Uncle Yan, they would not dare to be presumptuous in front of Yan Ruoxue.

“What are you doing here?” the third princess said unhappily.

Yan Ruoxue was not angry. She smiled and said, “Third Princess, I have to take this person with me. He’s of use to me. How about this? Didn’t you want to see Yao Xi? I can take you to see him. How about that?”

Hearing this, the third princess’s eyes brightened, but soon she came to her senses.

The third Princess was only evil, but she was not stupid.

Therefore, the third princess snorted and said, “You can take him away, but you must bring Yao Xi to me first. Otherwise, there’s no room for negotiation!”

“I’ve said that this person is very important to me. I must take him away,” Yan Ruoxue frowned and said.

“What does it have to do with me if he’s important to you?” The third princess did not seem to care.

Finally, Yan Ruoxue lost her patience.

She looked at Uncle Yan and coldly said, “You take him away from Xihuang Island. I want to see who dares to stop you.”

Upon hearing Yan Ruoxue’s words, Uncle Yan could not help but frown.

He opened his mouth and wanted to say something but was stopped by Yan Ruoxue’s gaze.

Uncle Yan had no choice but to follow the order.

With Yan Ruoxue’s order, Uncle Yan naturally had nothing to worry about.

“Yes, I’ll take him away now,” he immediately nodded and said.

“Don’t you dare!” the third princess was immediately enraged and scolded. “What are you guys doing? Stop him!

Everyone looked at each other.

If Yan Ruoxue didn’t turn up, they would dare to challenge Uncle Yan. They weren’t his match, but at least to put on a good show.

But now that Yan Ruoxue was here, who would dare to take action?

“I told you to stop him. Did you hear me?” The third princess was furious. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Third Princess, please don’t make things difficult for them. With their abilities, I’m afraid they can’t stop me.” Uncle Yan sneered and said.

After saying that, Uncle Yan turned around and left with Qin Yu.

No matter how angry the third princess was, she could not do anything to Uncle Yan.

Bringing Qin Yu along, Uncle Yan left the Yan family and went straight to the teleportation station that was far away.

Uncle Yan’s expression was tremendously cold when they arrived at the teleportation station.

He looked at Qin Yu in front of him and said coldly, “Do you know how much trouble you’ve caused for Miss Yan?”

Qin Yu also felt very uncomfortable. He smiled bitterly and said, “I didn’t expect it to drag on for so long. Will Ruoxue be in any trouble?”

“What do you think?” Uncle Yan berated, then said coldly, “I’m telling you, this is one last time! If it ever happens again, I’ll kill you even if I were to be punished! Hurry up and get lost!”

Qin Yu sighed. Even though he was very worried, there was nothing he could do.

After sending Qin Yu off, Uncle Yan returned to Xihuang Island.

Of course, no matter how bold the third princess was, she wouldn’t dare to do anything to Yan Ruoxue. Therefore, Uncle Yan wasn’t too worried. He was only afraid that the Yan family would question him.

At the other end, Qin Yu returned from the teleportation station to the vicinity of Sky City.

He wasn’t in a hurry to look for Si Shifeng. Instead, he found a hidden area and spent three days there before he entered the middle stage of the Reversion Void successfully.

After he entered the middle stage of the Reversion Void, Qin Yu’s power skyrocketed!

The sons of all the great aristocratic families were only in the middle stage of the Reversion Void. Other than Si Shiyue and a few others, Qin Yu was not afraid of anyone.

Feeling the vast power in his body, he had anticipation in his heart.

“Even if I don’t have many techniques, it’s still a piece of cake for me to deal with Si Shifeng,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He had initially wanted to comprehend the technique before fighting Si Shifeng. Unfortunately, Qin Yu’s wishful thinking failed.

The Si family had carried out a thorough search of the area around Sky City.

With the help of secret treasure and powerful divine sense, Qin Yu had nowhere to hide.

Just as Qin Yu was sitting cross-legged, several internal qi surrounded him.

Shortly after, the void in front of him trembled, and several people wearing the Si family’s robes walked out.

“Qin Yu?”

The leader was a somewhat muscular man. Judging from his clothes, his status in the Si family should not be low.

...

Qin Yu got up and said, “That’s right. Where’s Si Shifeng? I’ve been here waiting for him for a long time. Why didn’t he come out? Is he afraid of me?”

When everyone heard this, they were stunned for a moment, and then a trace of anger appeared on their faces.

This Qin Yu actually turned the tables!

“You, sharp-tongued b*stard! You’re hiding in such a secluded place, and you dare to say Young Master Feng is afraid?” The man in the lead said coldly.

Qin Yu laughed and said, “Bullsh*t! He only mentioned outside Sky City, and he didn’t say I couldn’t be here. Why the hell are you putting on so much show? If I wanted to run, what am I still doing here? Is your brain filled with sh*t?”

“You’re courting death!” When the burly man heard this, he was furious and instantly clenched his fist!

Qin Yu did not dodge but sneered and said, “What? You’re afraid that Si Shifeng can’t beat me, so you want to attack me first?”

“You!” The burly man was trembling with anger, but he couldn’t do anything to Qin Yu.

“Come back to Sky City with me now!” he said, pointing at Qin Yu.

“Go back your a*s! Don’t you know that you can’t fight in Sky City? I’ll wait for him at the city walls of Sky City!” Qin Yu snorted coldly.

After saying this, Qin Yu got up and left.

...

His pace wasn’t fast. Soon the Si family members caught up to him.

“Send someone back to inform Young Master Feng,” the burly man said.

“I advise you not to. If you send someone back to Sky City, I’m afraid the rest can’t stop me. If I run away, where are you going to find me?” Qin Yu said sarcastically.

The burly man’s face turned somewhat ugly. He knew that Qin Yu was not weak, but no one was sure of his abilities.
