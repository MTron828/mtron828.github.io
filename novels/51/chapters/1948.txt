1949 The Function of the Face

Si Shifeng nodded and said, “Alright then. I just don’t know if Qin Yu will take this opportunity to escape.”

As he spoke, Si Shifeng’s expression couldn’t help but turn cold.

“The Si family can never lose, never,” Si Shiyue said coldly.

After saying this, Si Shiyue glanced at the Semi-Saint next to him.

The Semi-Saint immediately understood what he meant. He walked forward and said with a smile, “Young Master Feng will not lose. Don’t worry, Holy Son.”

Si Shiyue didn’t say anything. He took a sip of water and didn’t say anything else.

Three days quickly passed. In these three days, Si Shifeng’s injuries had not recovered. At most, he could only use half of his strength.

Outside the Sky City, the Si family had sent people to guard the place. As soon as Qin Yu appeared, they would be the first to notice him.

“This Qin Yu doesn’t seem to have left Sky City,” Si Shifeng said in a deep voice.

Si Shiyue was silent, and no one knew what he was thinking. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“This kid didn’t plan to hide in Sky City, did he?” Si Shifeng frowned and said.

Si Shiyue said in a deep voice, “Even if he did, how long can he hide? If he stays in Sky City, he won’t be a threat,and I can’t be bothered with him.”

After saying this, Si Shiyue paused and said, “But… I don’t think he’ll do that. Having a chaotic body, he’ll be unwilling to live a mediocre life.”

“I hope so.” Si Shifeng sighed.

On the other end, Qin Yu was still in seclusion.

His state of mind had reached the Middle-stage of Tribulation, and he only needed an enormous amount of spiritual energy and dense dark energy for support.

With the dragon blood as her foundation, Qin Yu naturally did not have to worry about spiritual energy. However, the dark energy was far from enough.

In the blink of an eye, eight days passed by.

Qin Yu’s absorption of spiritual energy had reached its peak.

He slowly opened his eyes and silently put away the dragon blood in front of him. Then he looked into the distance as if thinking about something.

“Don’t tell me I have to go to the Yan family again!” Qin Yu thought to himself.

The only places Qin Yu could think of to get the dark energy was the tomb of the Immortal Emperor in Thunder Courtyard and the Yan family’s Xihuang Island.

However, the tomb of the Immortal Emperor was too far away, and Qin Yu didn’t want to bother Dean Lei.

In that case, Qin Yu could only choose the Yan family’s Xihuang Island.

“I have the Yan family’s token, so I don’t need to climb those stone stairways,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

But when he thought of the third princess, Qin Yu felt a headache.

That person was a pervert. With her around, Qin Yu couldn’t cultivate peacefully.

“Forget it. I don’t care anymore. Let’s go to Xihuang Island. Let’s get there first and then figure it out.” Qin Yu made up his mind.

He got up and left this quiet place, slowly walking around Sky City.

Needless to say, the Si family’s people must have already blocked the way out of the city. It wouldn’t be that easy to leave this place.

Qin Yu was not worried. Fortunately, he had the secret technique given by Saintess Gu, which he could completely conceal his internal qi and change his look.

Therefore, before he was discovered, Qin Yu went to an Inn and stayed there temporarily.

After entering the room, Qin Yu quickly closed the door and prepared to activate the secret technique.

“I hope this time, I can have a more ordinary look. At least I won’t attract attention,” Qin Yu murmured.

After that, without any delay, Qin Yu immediately began to activate the secret technique.

Rays of light gathered on Qin Yu’s face. In a short while, cracking sounds came from his face, followed by a series of pain.

Fortunately, the pain was not worth mentioning to Qin Yu, so he endured it.

Half an hour later, the pain on his face began to disappear, and his face had changed.

Qin Yu opened his eyes and eagerly picked up the mirror.

But when he saw his face in the mirror, he was stunned.

This face was too perfect! It was simply perfect and flawless, like an unpolished jade!

Compared to Yao Xi, there wasn’t much difference!

“D*mn it, this face…” Qin Yu touched his face with mixed feelings. He didn’t know if he should be happy or have a headache.

With such a face, he would definitely attract more attention if he walked on the street!

Last time, he was so ugly that it was unbearable to look at. This time, he looked so striking. What kind of bullsh*t secret technique is this?” Qin Yu couldn’t help cursing.

However, since he had already changed his face, he could only go back to the Yan family with this face.

Without any delay, Qin Yu quickly left the inn and prepared to go to the Yan family.

As Qin Yu had expected, numerous people, especially the women, turned to look at him. They looked at Qin Yu with their eyes shining bright as if they had found a delicious beast.

“Look! That man is so handsome!”

“D*mn it! There’s actually such a perfect-looking man in this world!”

“Is he from the Yao family? Could he be the younger brother of the Yao family’s Holy Son?”

“His look is not any inferior to the Yao family’s Holy Son!”

The people in the surrounding were talking about it animatedly. Qin Y blushed hearing them.

Soon, a female cultivator approached Qin Yu.

...

“My friend, can we discuss dao together? I can see that your breathing is in disorder. I’m afraid there’s a problem with your cultivation.”

“You think you’re worthy of giving guidance to this friend with your little strength? Let me do it instead!”

“Hehe, you can’t be that strong either!”

“Oh? If you’re not convinced, you can try!”

“I’m not afraid of you!”

Qin Yu’s face darkened, and he quickly took the opportunity to run away.

He knew this face would have an impact, but he didn’t expect it to be this big!

“Sigh! Is this the treatment of a handsome guy?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

Qin Yu had no choice but to cover his face to avoid unnecessary trouble.

Soon, Qin Yu arrived at the entrance of Sky City.

As Qin Yu had expected, the Si family had deployed people here. They stretched out their hands to block Qin Yu’s way and scolded, “Why are you covering your face?”

...

Qin Yu was a little nervous because the two people in front of him were extremely powerful. No one could guarantee they could not detect his internal qi.

“Because this face has brought me unnecessary trouble…” he said.

“Don’t talk nonsense! Take it off!” the other party berated.

Qin Yu had no choice but to take off the cover on his face.

When they saw Qin Yu’s face, they were stunned for a moment, then frowned.

“Hurry up and go!” the two men said unhappily.

Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief. He pretended to be relaxed and slowly walked out of the city gate.

“D*mn it! It’s just a pretty boy.”

“I salute him! A male cultivator with such a look. I feel like beating him up!”

“That’s right. I really don’t know if those female cultivators are blind. They actually like this kind of pretty boy.”

Hearing the discussion of the two behind him, Qin Yu couldn’t help secretly clicking his tongue and quickenig his pace.
