Chapter 515: Herbs in the Dark Energy Tomb! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Regardless of whether it was spiritual energy or dark energy, Qin Yu needed more!

He stood up from the ground.

This was the third time he had absorbed dark energy on such a large scale.

And the effect this time seemed to be much better than before.

“Could it be that if I absorb too much spiritual energy, the effect of dark energy will increase?” Qin Yu thought to himself.

If it wasn’t for the existence of the Consummate Inner Strength Grandmaster realm, Qin Yu would have already stepped into the half-step Martial Marquis realm, or even beyond the half-step Martial Marquis realm.

‘As long as I step into the small realm of the half-step Martial Marquis realm, it shouldn’t be too long before I step into the Martial Marquis realm,’ Qin Yu thought to himself.

The accumulation of the dark energy provided a certain guarantee for Qin Yu’s subsequent breakthrough.

“If there are three places like this, I can enter the Martial Marquis Realm,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but look at the man with the mustache not far away.

This man with the mustache was digging graves one by one, and large graves were places where dark energy was prevalent!

“Maybe this man with the mustache has a way!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little excited.

At this moment, the man with the mustache was still circling around this area.

He would stomp his feet from time to time, or lie on the ground and listen to something.

“How is it? Haven’t you found something yet?” Qin Yu asked.

The man with the mustache was so startled that he quivered. He glared at Qin Yu and said, “Why are you acting so stealthy? Are you trying to scare me to death?!”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “It seems that you have broken into a lot of graves. Otherwise, why would you be so timid?”

The man said with some pride, “Of course! From the Qin Dynasty’s emperor’s grave to my grandmother’s grave, there’s no place I haven’t been to!”

Hearing this, Qin Yu was secretly delighted.

It seemed that he had to build a good relationship with this man.

“It’s here!”

At this time, the man raised his foot and stepped on the ground. A hint of excitement flashed in his eyes.

Then, the man with the mustache took out a few sacrificial items from his Spatial Magic Artifact and knelt on the ground to start worshiping.

“What? You guys actually care about this when you’re just graverobbers?” Qin Yu said jokingly.

The man with the mustache rolled his eyes and said, “This is the rule. You don’t understand.”

After everything was ready, the man with the mustache began to make his move.

He took out a shovel, formed a spell with his hand, and fell towards the ground.

“Boom!”

In just a short moment, the ground began to shake!

A layer of the ground above actually began to fall off!

The man with the mustache hurriedly pulled Qin Yu to the side and said excitedly, “Wait and see, there’s definitely a big treasure inside!”

Layers of the ground fell off. A few minutes later, a complete tomb appeared in front of the two of them!

At a glance, the structure of the tomb was extremely exquisite, like an ancient palace!

The interior looked like it had been specially built by an architect. The construction was extremely magnificent!

Qin Yu was stunned for a moment!

A tomb could actually be built so beautifully? It was simply unbelievable!

“How is it? Do you know how capable I am?” The man with the mustache stroked his beard and said proudly.

Qin Yu stared at the huge tomb and said in a low voice, “There must be a treasure inside!”

“Of course.” The man with the mustache said seriously.

He pointed at the Dragon Vein on top and then pointed at the tomb in front of him.

“This is called the Yin-Yang Grave. To be able to set the tomb near the Dragon Vein, it’s obvious he was a big shot when he was alive.” The man with the mustache said quietly.

Qin Yu gave the man with the mustache a thumbs up from the bottom of his heart.

Sure enough, there were professionals in each field. Even a top organization like the Jingdu Martial Arts Association couldn’t compare to a top-notch professional.

“Let’s go,” the man with the mustache said.

“There won’t be any danger inside, right?” Qin Yu asked.

The man with the mustache shook his head and said, “It’s impossible to set up a killing formation in the land of the Dragon Vein. Otherwise, the owner of the tomb wouldn’t have to go through so much trouble to hide his own tomb.”

Qin Yu followed behind the man with the mustache and entered the large tomb.

As expected, the journey was smooth.

The man with the mustache seemed to have been here before as he brought Qin Yu straight to a stone door.

The stone door was facing the north and the south. It was square and had a regal vibe.

The man with the mustache formed a seal with his hand and tapped forward. The door rumbled open!

The man’s methods stunned Qin Yu. This had also changed Qin Yu’s impression of the man with the mustache greatly.

The moment the door opened, they saw the treasures inside!

There were herbs hidden in jars, more than half a chest of gold, and some accessories worn by people.

In the eyes of ordinary people, this was just ordinary treasure in the secular world.

But to cultivators, these so-called accessories were actually top-notch Magic Artifacts!

Qin Yu quickly walked forward and reached out to break a jar.

In the jar, there was an unknown medicinal herb.

Qin Yu held this medicinal herb and couldn’t help but frown slightly.

Because there was no spiritual energy on this medicinal herb!

“How could this be?” Qin Yu frowned and said.

The man with the mustache seemed to see Qin Yu’s confusion.

He sneered. “This is the dark energy tomb. The herbs inside are just funerary objects. How could there be spiritual energy?”

Qin Yu’s expression was a bit ugly.

What he was short of now was a 5,000-year-old herb.

If he couldn’t get it, this trip would be in vain to Qin Yu.

“There are so many treasures. I have to pick first this time!” The man with the mustache licked his lips and said with a smile.

He ran to the middle of the pile of treasures and began to choose.

Qin Yu stood there without moving for a long time. No one knew what he was thinking.

“Right!”

At this moment, Qin Yu seemed to have thought of something.

He hurriedly looked at the man with the mustache and said, “Can you tell the age of this big tomb?”

The man with the mustache glanced at Qin Yu and sneered. “You are doubting my abilities? I even know when he built the tomb, let alone the age!”

Qin Yu hurriedly said, “Bro, how old is this big tomb?”

The man with the mustache looked around, sniffed, and said with a smile, “I roughly estimate it to be around 3,000 years old.”

3,000 years?

“Someone who can build such a big tomb is definitely a big shot!” Qin Yu thought to himself. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“The funerary objects of such a big shot are definitely not ordinary herbs.”

In other words, the funerary herbs of a big shot would definitely be treasures of the current era, and have medicinal effects that were at least a thousand years old!

At that time, herbs weren’t as scarce as they were now. This stalk of herbs might have already reached several thousand years old at that time!

Now that another 3,000 years had passed, the probability of this stalk of herbs being more than 5,000 years old was very high!

“The pill formula only said that it needed a stalk of 5,000-year-old herbs, but it didn’t say that it needed to preserve its medicinal effects...” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Qin Yu had no other choice now, so he could only give it a try.

“Are you going to refine the Reincarnation Pill?” At this time, the man with the mustache next to him suddenly said with a smile.

Qin Yu said with a bit of surprise, “You actually know about the Reincarnation Pill?”

The man with the mustache said proudly, “I’ve traveled north and south for many years. There are at least eight hundred tombs that I have been to. How can there be anything that I don’t know?”

At this point, the man paused for a moment and said with a smile, “Not only do I know about the Reincarnation Pill, but I also have the ingredients needed for the Reincarnation Pill. If you are willing, you can exchange that bronze mirror with me for them. How about it?”
