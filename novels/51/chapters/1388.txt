Chapter 1389: Chapter 1,389, Ghost City 1

The two of them rode on the Flying Exotic Beast and rushed towards Gu City.

No one had expected that boss Zheng would travel with them.

It had to be said that with boss Zheng’s company, their speed on the way was much faster.

The flying exotic beast that he had found was indeed quite precious. Its speed could even be compared to the wind chasing foal.

Three days later.

The two of them successfully arrived at Gu City.

“This is Gu City. I haven’t been here for a long time,”boss Zheng said expectantly.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “Boss Zheng, are you interested in sister Lin?”

Boss Zheng blushed and said, “That’s not true. Sigh, I can’t get along with a brat like you.”

Qin Yu sighed and said, “Boss Zheng, I’ll tell you one thing. Licking a dog doesn’t end well. When it’s time to cut your losses, cut your losses.”

“Go, go, go. What do you know?”Boss Zheng didn’t listen.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more and walked in the direction of the auction.

They came to the vicinity of the auction.

It was daytime and the auction was busy. Qin Yu didn’t want to disturb them, so she waited nearby.

As usual, after today’s auction ended, there were people fighting outside. The only difference was that they didn’t pick up any treasures this time.

“Tsk Tsk, this gu city is really scary,”boss Zheng said after taking a sip of tea.

Qin Yu didn’t reply. He stood up and said, “Let’s go, it’s time to go in.”

Then, the two of them stood up and walked into the auction.

Sister Lin was backstage at the moment, and Qin Yu and boss Zheng were waiting outside.

After more than an hour, sister Lin finally walked out after finishing her work.

When she saw Qin Yu and boss Zheng sitting in the auction hall, she was obviously stunned.

“Sister Lin.”Qin Yu hurriedly stood up and greeted sister Lin.

Boss Zheng also stood up with a smile, his eyes almost shining.

Sister Lin walked in front of the two and then frowned, “Boss Zheng, why are you here?”

Boss Zheng said shyly, “I just happened to have nothing to do here, so I thought I’d come to see you and send your brother off.”

Sister Lin was silent for a moment and said, “Boss Zheng, you’d better go back. Qin and I. . . I have something to do with him.”

“It’s okay. You guys do what you want. I promise I won’t cause any trouble!”Boss Zheng guaranteed.

Sister Lin frowned and said, “You should go back quickly. An Fenglou can’t leave you.”

“Don’t worry. I’ve already made the arrangements!”Boss Zheng patted his chest and said.

Seeing boss Zheng like this, sister Lin made up her mind and said, “Boss Zheng, I know your intentions toward me, but it’s impossible between you and me. It’s never going to happen. Do you understand?”

Hearing this, boss Zheng, who had been full of excitement, was suddenly stunned. The expression on his face was obviously frozen.

“Boss Zheng, if you understand, then leave quickly,”said sister Lin.

With that, she took out a card from her pocket and stuffed it into boss Zheng’s hand.

“I’ve calculated. The money I asked you to spend for your help is all here,”said sister Lin.

Boss Zheng came back to his senses. He hurriedly returned Qian Sai to sister Lin and said, “You don’t have to be so polite. I. . . I finally came out. Can I just treat it as a vacation?”

Sister Lin seemed to be unable to bear it. She sighed and said, “Alright then.”

Then, sister Lin pulled Qin Yu to the side. After making sure that boss Zheng would not hear, she said, “Qin Yu, why did you bring him here?”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “He insisted on coming. I had no choice...”

Sister Lin sighed and said, “You will harm him like this.”

“Why do you say that?”Qin Yu was stunned.

Sister Lin waved her hand and did not explain.

“I will bring you to see my friend tonight. If possible, you must not let boss Zheng follow you,”said sister Lin.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Okay, I understand.”

Then, sister Lin arranged accommodation for Qin Yu and boss Zheng and left the inn in a hurry.

Staying in the inn, Qin Yu looked at boss Zheng and said, “Boss Zheng, sister Lin has been so direct. Why do you still want to stay?”

Boss Zheng smiled and said, “It’s okay. After this trip, I won’t see her again.”

“Is it meaningful?”Qin Yu asked.

Boss Zheng said, “You don’t understand. People have to be responsible for their own feelings. Whether they succeed or not, even if it ends, there should be a ceremony, right?”

At this point, boss Zheng paused and whispered again, “Even if this ceremony is meaningless to anyone...” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

These words seemed to be said to Qin Yu, but also to himself.

At this moment, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little sorry for boss Zheng.

At night.

Sister Lin arrived at the inn.

Boss Zheng was as usual, desperately trying to curry favor with sister Lin, as if he wanted to seize the last chance.

But sister Lin’s response, although polite, was cold.

“Well, we should go,”sister Lin looked at Qin Yu and said.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Where are we going?”

“The ghost market. He must be in the ghost market at this time,”sister Lin said.
