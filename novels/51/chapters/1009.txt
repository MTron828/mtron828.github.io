Chapter 1010: Chapter 1,010 — divine sense grew stronger! 

The moment these words left her mouth, the pavilion master’s expression changed slightly.

She looked coldly at Xiang Danqing, and there seemed to be a trace of anger in her eyes.

Xiang Danqing snorted lightly, “What? You’ve been protecting him your whole life, and you can’t even bring it up?”

“That was my choice,”the pavilion master said coldly.

Xiang Danqing waved his hand and said, “Anyway, I think this kid looks a little like him.”

Pavilion master was silent for a moment, and then said, “Because Qin Yu is his son.”

Xiang Danqing was stunned, and then laughed out loud, “No wonder, no wonder you’re so attentive!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“But then again, this kid can’t be your son, right?”Xiang Danqing laughed out loud.

“Of course not.”Pavilion master shook his head, and there seemed to be a hint of helplessness in his tone.

Just as the two of them were chatting, a bright light burst out from Qin Yu’s body not far away!

This bright light rose from his Dantian and shot straight to the center of his brows!

Xiang Danqing and pavilion master quickly turned around and looked at Qin Yu.

“Swish!”

Following that, an extremely terrifying internal Qi burst out from Qin Yu’s body!

Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes, and a bright light burst out from his eyes!

This bright light shot to the side, and actually directly shattered the stone wall!

Pavilion master and Xiang Danqing exchanged a glance, and then quickly walked towards Qin Yu.

“How do you feel?”Pavilion master asked.

Qin Yu glanced at pavilion master, then slowly stood up and said in a low voice, “My golden core has recovered.”

“Phew.”

The pavilion master instantly let out a slight sigh of relief.

“Not only have I recovered, I feel that my strength seems to have improved again compared to before,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Although he could not figure out why, the spiritual power in his body had indeed become more vigorous.

“It seems that the handlebar mustache and tie Dan are right. Once I become a martial saint, it’s not an exaggeration to say that I’m invincible in the world,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“Do you plan to make a breakthrough now?”Pavilion master asked.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No rush. I still have something in my hand.”

After he had finished speaking, Qin Yu flipped his palm and a leaf that shone like lava landed in his hand.

This leaf was the scarlet fire leaf that he had obtained at the hundred spirits gathering.

“What is this?”Xiang Danqing asked in shock.

Qin Yu said, “Scarlet fire leaf. It can increase the power of divine sense.”

“I’ve never seen this thing before,”pavilion master also said.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but squint his eyes.

Even Pavilion Master and Xiang Danqing didn’t know about this thing.

It seemed that tie Dan wasn’t lying. The person who knew about this thing was probably someone who had lived for more than a thousand years.

“This handlebar mustache...”Qin Yu muttered in his heart. For a moment, he couldn’t figure out the identity of this handlebar mustache.

Of course, Qin Yu didn’t think any further. He looked at the two of them and said, “Seniors, I’ll have to trouble the two of you to protect me.”

“No worries.”Pavilion master nodded.

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude. He didn’t waste any time. He immediately hung the scarlet fire leaf above his head and began to absorb the scarlet fire leaf.

The scarlet fire leaf hung above his head as if it had melted. Threads of internal Qi flowed down from the scarlet fire leaf and fused with Qin Yu’s divine sense.

Under the effects of the scarlet flame leaf, Qin Yu’s divine sense was slowly increasing.

At the same time.

Hua Zongxiong had already brought people to the Heaven Gate.

He brought people directly into the hall and asked coldly, “Where’s Qin Yu?”

NIE tianxiang said with puzzlement, “Our sect master has something to do. What’s the matter, sir?”

Hua zongxiong narrowed his eyes. He released his divine sense and covered more than half of the Heaven Gate, but didn’t find Qin Yu’s figure.

“Why? Didn’t Qin Yu tell you?”Hua Zongxiong raised his eyebrows and asked.

“Tell us what?”Nie tianxiang asked.

When Hua Zongxiong heard that, he couldn’t help but laugh and said, “It seems that your sect master of the Heaven Gate is just an empty title!”

“I said that I will take over the Heaven Gate in three days! He actually ran away at the last minute?”

NIE tianxiang frowned and said, “Don’t talk nonsense, our sect master...”

“Boom!”

Before nie tianxiang could finish his words, an extremely powerful internal Qi erupted from Hua Zongxiong’s body!

The might of a martial saint filled the entire hall!

For a moment, everyone trembled under this pressure!

NIE tianxiang did not dare to say a word.

Hua zongxiong said coldly, “From today on, the Heaven Gate will belong to me, Hua Zongxiong. If anyone is not convinced, you can step forward.”

The place was silent. No one said anything.

Just as Qin Yu had guessed, he had no foundation in the Heaven Gate. It didn’t make much difference to the disciples who would be the sect master.

Hua Zongxiong didn’t expect things to go so smoothly either. He couldn’t help but sneer.

“From now on, everyone will listen to my orders. Those who disobey will die!”

“If that Qin Yu returns, remember to inform me!”

...

In the Dragon Transformation Valley.

The scarlet fire leaf hanging above his head was disappearing bit by bit.

From the initial palm-sized to now, it was only as small as a bean.

“Qin Yu’s divine sense is already far beyond ordinary people. Now, he still needs to increase the power of his divine sense.”Xiang Danqing looked at Qin Yu and could not help but whisper.

The pavilion master quietly said, “He is a very hard-working person. He has been fighting against the martial arts association of Jingdu for a long time, and we are all waiting for the moment when he becomes a martial saint.”

“The martial arts association of Jingdu... I remember that the last person who publicly challenged them was still Jiang he,”Xiang Danqing said in a low voice.

“That’s right.”The pavilion master nodded slightly.

Xiang Danqing could not help but feel a little emotional.

In the blink of an eye, so much time had passed. The younger generation had already grown to such an extent.

At this moment, the scarlet fire leaf hanging above Qin Yu’s head was completely absorbed by him.

At this moment, a golden light burst out from the center of Qin Yu’s brows!

The golden light rapidly transformed into Qin Yu’s appearance. His entire body was filled with golden light, which was exceptionally dazzling in this dragon transformation valley.

Qin Yu’s divine sense seemed to have become even denser. He was not in a hurry to return to his original body. Instead, he walked towards a place not too far away.

The distance between his divine sense and his original body was getting farther and farther. From the initial three steps, he had walked a full ten steps!

Not only that, his divine sense still had no intention of stopping!

“It can actually be so far away from his original body?”Pavilion master and Xiang Danqing could not help but be greatly shocked.

The divine sense only stopped after taking twenty-three steps!

“Hiss...”the pavilion master and Xiang Danqing looked at each other and sucked in a breath of cold air!

One had to know that for a martial marquis, the divine sense could not be too far away from the main body!

“Such a powerful divine sense, I really don’t know what kind of scene it will be after stepping into the martial saint realm...”
