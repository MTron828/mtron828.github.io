Jiang Haoran’s pupils dilated as a terrifying murderous aura rose!

“Qin Yu, don’t you dare!” Jiang Haoran glared at Qin Yu angrily and berated loudly.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “You can try and see if I dare.”

Jiang Haoran was just about to speak when Jiang Yu shouted desperately, “I beg you, don’t provoke him...”

Seeing Jiang Yu’s miserable state, Jiang Haoran was furious again!

“No one dares to do this to the Jiang family.” Jiang Haoran looked at Qin Yu coldly.

“Do you know the consequences of crossing the Jiang Family?”

Qin Yu said nonchalantly, “I live in the moment.”

“Okay, okay!” A terrifying qi energy burst out from Jiang Haoran’s body! A faint light surrounded his body!

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and was surprised to find that Jiang Haoran was a second stage Inner Strength Past Master like Hong Wu!

“What? Do you want to fight?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and asked.

“Don’t!” Jiang Haoran, his face full of fear, shouted desperately!

Jiang Haoran glared at Qin Yu hatefully.

But in the end, he didn’t make a move. After all, Jiang Yu was still in Qin Yu’s hands.

“Kid, let me tell you, even if you run to the ends of the earth, I will tear you into pieces!” Jiang Haoran said coldly.

After saying this, Jiang Haoran turned around and left.

“Oh right.” After taking a few steps, Jiang Haoran stopped.

“If my brother loses even half a hair, I won’t let you go.” Jiang Haoran snorted nonchalantly and got in the car.

Qin Yu’s expression was calm, and there was no sign of fear.

He sat cross-legged on the ground while waiting for Jiang Haoran to deliver the herbs.

After Jiang Haoran returned home, a group of people from the Jiang family quickly surrounded him.

“Eldest Young Master, where is the Second Young Master?” The butler asked anxiously.

Jiang Haoran’s expression was full of anger, and he didn’t say anything.

After he returned to the living room, he couldn’t help but say angrily, “Qin Yu is really too brazen! He doesn’t take the Jiang family seriously at all!”

The butler asked in confusion, “Eldest Young Master, what happened?”

Jiang Haoran waved his hand and said, “Don’t talk nonsense. Go and prepare a hundred-year-old ginseng immediately.”

The butler froze and frowned. “Eldest Young Master, if this matter is spread, the Jiang family’s reputation might...”

Jiang Haoran glanced at him and said coldly, “Then what about my brother? Is the Jiang family’s reputation more important than my brother’s life?”

The butler was speechless and could only order people to prepare.

Jiang Haoran took a deep breath and said with a vicious expression, “I will definitely cut Qin Yu into pieces!”

With the Jiang family’s abilities, it wasn’t a problem to prepare the herbs.

In just an hour, the butler brought back a hundred-year-old herb.

After taking the herb, Jiang Haoran turned around and left.

In the cemetery, Qin Yu sat cross-legged without any sense of fear.

Jiang Yu grimaced in pain and almost fainted many times.

“He’s coming.”

At this moment, Qin Yu’s eyes opened.

Then, he looked at the car a short distance away.

Soon, Jiang Haoran came to Qin Yu with the herbs.

“Here are the herbs. Let my brother go.” Jiang Haoran directly handed the herbs to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu sniffed hard. It was indeed a hundred-year-old ginseng.

“As expected of the Jiang family. You guys found a hundred-year-old ginseng so quickly.” Qin Yu sighed.

Jiang Haoran said coldly, “Cut the crap. You have what you want, so let him go quickly!”

Qin Yu glanced at Jiang Yu and said, “Go.”

When he heard this, Jiang Yu ran away.

However, his leg was injured, so he could only roll and crawl.

Seeing this, Jiang Haoran was instantly furious.

The dignified Young Master of the Jiang family was actually climbing on the ground like a dog!

“Trash, the Jiang family is completely disgraced by you!” Jiang Haoran said through gritted teeth.

Jiang Yu didn’t dare to say anything. He could only keep his head lowered with a fearful expression. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Get in the car!” Jiang Haoran scolded coldly.

After Jiang Yu got in the car, Qin Yu got up from the ground and was ready to leave.

However, Jiang Haoran took a step forward and blocked Qin Yu’s way.

“What? You want to leave after taking the Jiang family’s things?” Jiang Haoran sneered.

“The Jiang family’s things? This ginseng was mine to begin with.” Qin Yu shook his head.

Jiang Haoran sneered and said, “Don’t tell me a story. I don’t want to hear it. All I know is that offending the Jiang family will only lead to death!”

As soon as he said that, a terrifying burst of qi energy burst out from Jiang Haoran’s body!

His qi energy was comparable to Hong Wu’s!

“Young Master Jiang, save your strength. You’re no match for me,” Qin Yu shook his head and said.

Jiang Haoran laughed and said, “No match for you? Kid, do you think you are invincible after defeating Hong Wu?”

“You aren’t much stronger than Hong Wu. Besides, I’m not at the same level I was at that time,” Qin Yu said nonchalantly with his hands behind his back.

Just as Qin Yu said, when he fought with Hong Wu, Qin Yu was only at level one of the Foundation Establishment Stage.

But now, Qin Yu had reached the second level.

Although it was only one level above, Qin Yu’s strength had increased!

His potential had been further released, and his physical body was several times stronger than before!

Therefore, Qin Yu was fearless when facing Jiang Haoran.

This was why he was so confident.

Jiang Haoran sneered and said, “Qin Yu, do you know how powerful a prominent family is?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I’m all ears.”

Jiang Haoran narrowed his eyes and said, “Do you know what the determining factor is when at the same level of strength? It’s the cultivation method!”

“The Jiang family has accumulated it for countless years, so our cultivation method inheritance is unparalleled. How can the puny Hong Wu be compared to us?”

When he heard this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but want to laugh.

No matter how impressive the Jiang family’s heritage was, how could it be more impressive than his father’s?

How could a martial artist, no matter how impressive his heritage was, be compared to an immortal cultivator?

“Your so-called heritage isn’t worth mentioning in front of me,” Qin Yu said with a nonchalant smile.

“Ignorant thing, I’ll let you know right now what an innate gap is!” After Jiang Haoran roared angrily, his Inner Strength instantly burst out!

This Inner Strength lingered on his fist, and then it swung towards Qin Yu’s chest fiercely!

But what surprised Jiang Haoran was that Qin Yu didn’t have any intention of dodging, and he allowed Jiang Haoran’s fist to smash towards his chest.

“Gotcha!” Jiang Haoran was instantly overjoyed!

Qin Yu would definitely die from this punch!

“Clang!”

After a loud sound, Jiang Haoran’s expression changed drastically!

He only felt as if his fist had smashed into steel. Not only was it unable to injure him in the slightest, it even hurted!

Qin Yu lowered his head to look at his own chest and shook his head. “If this is all you have, you should save your strength.”
