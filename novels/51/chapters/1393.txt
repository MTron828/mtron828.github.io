Chapter 1394: Chapter 1,394, water of Life 1

Brother Dao’s words had indeed shocked Qin Yu.

He could tell that the handlebar mustache had some ability, but he had never thought that he would have such a reputation in the holy region! He had even become a legend among his peers!

“Then what happened after that?”Qin Yu continued to ask.

Brother Dao lightly snorted, he said, “He was too arrogant. He went to steal the tombs of the nine great families. Wasn’t that courting death? He was discovered when he went to the first tomb. He was chased all the way and his body was shattered. If he didn’t have a secret treasure, he would have already become a corpse.”

“Speaking of which, his abilities are indeed great. The only one who could escape from the nine great families is probably him.”Brother Dao couldn’t help but sigh.

Qin Yu said in a low voice, “Looks like what this kid said is true.”

“Why? Do You Know Him?”Brother Dao asked.

Qin Yu immediately shook his head and said, “I don’t know him. I’ve only heard of him.”

Brother Dao grunted and said, “I don’t think you know that kind of legendary figure.”

Qin Yu coughed and asked tentatively, “The person who attacked is not from the Yan family, right?”

“No.”Brother Dao shook his head straightforwardly. “Although I can’t remember who exactly attacked, it is definitely not the Yan family.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. As long as it wasn’t the Yan family, it was good. Otherwise, they would be in a dilemma.

“By the way, try not to mention this person in front of outsiders in the future. It’s easy to get into trouble,”Brother Dao reminded.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “I got it.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Then, the two of them got up and continued on their journey.

It was a long journey. In addition, Qin Yu needed to eat and eat, so some time was delayed.

In the blink of an eye, six days had passed.

Boss Zheng, who had returned to an Fenglou, also planned to report this matter to the Great Elder.

He sat in the room and thought about it, his face full of worry.

“It should be about time, right? It has been so long,”boss Zheng whispered.

“He must have left gu city in six days.”

Just as boss Zheng stood up and was about to head to the heavenly cloud sect, Ding Yi suddenly walked in from outside.

When he saw Ding Yi, boss Zheng hurriedly waved his hand and said, “You came at the right time. I was just about to tell you something. You Don’t need to send the goods tomorrow. I’ll send them myself.”

Ding Yi grunted and then stood there for a long time without leaving.

Boss zheng frowned and said, “Why? Do you have something else to do?”

Ding Yi bit his lips and said, “Boss Zheng, do you know where Yan Qin went?”

Hearing this, boss Zheng couldn’t help but sigh.

He patted Ding Yi’s shoulder and said, “Ding Yi, although I don’t know what happened between the two of you, I have to tell you. Give up. You and he are not from the same world.”

Ding Yi hurriedly said, “Why do you say that? Do You Know Him?”

Boss Zheng opened his mouth. He wanted to tell Ding Yi about Qin Yu’s identity, but he didn’t dare to say anything.

“In short, don’t look for him. Otherwise, you will harm yourself,”boss Zheng said coldly.

Seeing boss Zheng’s attitude, she, who had originally suspected Qin Yu’s identity, was now even more certain of her thoughts:

Even if Yan Qin wasn’t Qin Yu, he must be related to Qin Yu!

“Boss Zheng, please tell me.”Ding Yi kneeled in front of boss Zheng.

Boss Zheng wasn’t a black-hearted boss. He, who was soft-hearted, had mixed feelings at the moment.

He looked at Ding Yi kneeling on the ground and couldn’t help but think of himself in front of sister Lin.

After thinking for a long time, boss Zheng finally told Ding Yi.

Ding Yi didn’t even think about it and immediately planned to leave an Fenglou.

“Wait.”At this moment, boss Zheng stopped Ding Yi.

He said in a deep voice, “If you want to come back, this seat will still be reserved for you.”

Ding Yi’s heart warmed. She bowed and said, “Thank you, boss Zheng.”

With that, she left Anfenglou.

Boss Zheng sighed. For a moment, he was in no mood.

“It’s a pity that there are lovers in the world.”Boss Zheng shook his head.

...

At this moment, Qin Yu and Brother Dao were still on the way to their destination.

According to Brother Dao’s calculation, they still needed to walk for a full three days.

“We’re almost there,”Brother Dao suddenly said.

Qin Yu raised her eyebrows and said, “Don’t we need another three days?”

“I made a mistake in my calculations,”Brother Dao said.

Then, he quickened his pace and walked forward quickly.

At this moment, Qin Yu also smelled a strange aura.

He immediately caught up with Brother Dao. Brother Dao’s mouth kept muttering, “It’s just ahead. We’re almost there.”

As he spoke, his footsteps became faster and faster. In the end, he rose into the air and shot forward.

Qin Yu did not waste any time. He immediately shook his feet and quickly caught up.

“Splash!”

A series of ear-piercing sounds rang out. A waterfall appeared before their eyes.

They saw a silver waterfall falling down as if it came from the sky.

The powerful sound of flowing water shook people’s bodies.

Such a magnificent scene made people admire it even more.

“This... This is the water of life? !”Qin Yu widened his eyes and couldn’t help but be ecstatic!
