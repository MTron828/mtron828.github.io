Chapter 186: Hijacking Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Mongrels?

Yang Jing, obviously not understanding, frowned.

Under the watchful eyes of everyone, Qin Yu walked toward a table at the side.

There were two young men at the table. Although they had restrained their internal qi, Qin Yu still discovered them.

Qin Yu sat down next to them and said with a nonchalant smile, “People from the Jiang Family?”

Their expressions changed, but they composed themselves quickly.

“What did you say? We don’t understand.” The two of them shook their heads.

Qin Yu raised his hand and pressed it on their shoulders.

“Do you think I wouldn’t discover you guys?” Qin Yu said coldly.

A huge force suddenly pressed down!

The two of them felt a cracking sensation in their shoulders, as if they were about to be broken!

“Go back and tell your master that he doesn’t need to follow me. I won’t run away. If he has the ability, come at me himself,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Cold sweat dripped down their foreheads. They nodded repeatedly and said, “We... we understand.”

Qin Yu didn’t make things difficult for them and immediately let them go.

Updates by

The two of them immediately felt relieved. Afraid that their bones would be crushed, they moved their arms.

The two of them had been following Qin Yu for a few days, but Qin Yu ignored them.

But now that he was going out, they had to warn the Jiang family.

“Okay, we can go now,” Qin Yu walked to Yang Jing and said.

Yang Jing nodded blankly, and then the two of them rushed to the airport.

When they arrived at the airport, Qin Yu realized that their destination was overseas! Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

This gave Qin Yu a headache.

“Why didn’t you tell me earlier that you were going overseas?” Qin Yu frowned.

Yang Jing mumbled, “What’s wrong with going overseas? My dad is so seriously ill right now, so he has to be recuperating overseas.”

If he had known earlier that he was going overseas, Qin Yu would have refused.

However, he couldn’t go back on his promise to someone else, so Qin Yu could only follow Yang Jing on the plane.

The plane flew into the high sky, and it took a full twenty hours to reach the destination.

Fortunately, Yang Jing didn’t lack money, so she bought a first-class cabin ticket.

Qin Yu had nothing to do on the plane, so he planned to use this opportunity to break through to the third level of the Foundation Establishment Stage.

“A small level leap of usually won’t cause any momentous phenomenon,” Qin Yu thought inside.

The Foundation Establishment Stage was a foundation building process. The possibility of triggering any momentous was almost zero.

Yang Jing was still chattering non-stop. Qin Yu glanced at her and said, “From now on, don’t talk to me. Don’t disturb me.”

Yang Jing looked offended. She said unhappily, “Other people don’t even have the chance to talk to me! Do you know how many fans I have?”

Qin Yu said with a half-hearted smile, “To your fans, you may be a lofty and unreachable person, but to people who don’t know you, you are at most a passer-by.”

Passer-by? Passer-by?

These words almost drove Yang Jing livid!

But unfortunately, Qin Yu no longer paid attention to her.

He closed his eyes and began to activate dark energy in his body while preparing to break through to the third level of the Foundation Establishment Stage.

“This is the first time I’m going to try to break through with dark energy. I wonder if I can do it.” Qin Yu was worried.

If his internal qi was disturbed, he might die on the spot!

But for ordinary people, if they didn’t take risks, where would they get the chance?

Without being privileged enough to be born with abundant resources, they could only rely on taking risks.

Wisps of dark energy started to flow through his dantian to his meridians.

Qin Yu felt as if he could see what was happening inside. He felt light spots appearing one after another in front of his pitch-black eyes.

These light spots were none other than Qin Yu’s major acupoints.

Dark energy surged out and began to break through the acupoints bit by bit.

During this period, the spiritual energy didn’t move at all. It was as if they were two systems that didn’t interfere with each other.

“It really works.” After feeling dark energy forcefully breaking through the acupoints, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel pleasantly surprised.

This way, his cultivation journey would be much smoother.

Of course, there was a disadvantage to this, which was that he couldn’t be discovered by others.

Otherwise, he might be surrounded by so-called “righteous people” .

...

The plane was still flying.

This was an international flight route and there were all kinds of people on the plane.

Yang Jing leaned against the window and seemed a little bored.

At this moment, commotion suddenly came from the economy class!

Yang Jing heard the commotion and stood up. She pulled open the curtain and saw that the people in the economy class were screaming desperately!

And there were two masked men with pistols in their hands!

Hijacking!

This word quickly flashed through Yang Jing’s mind!

She had been on countless planes, and she had only seen hijacking in the news. She didn’t expect to actually encounter it today!

“Qin Yu! Someone is hijacking the plane!” Yang Jing suddenly panicked. The only person she could rely on was Qin Yu.

However, Qin Yu had no reactionzz. No matter how much she shook Qin Yu’s body, Qin Yu didn’t open his eyes.

“Everyone, don’t be agitated. We are only after money,” the two robbers said coldly.

“As long as you guys hand over the money, we will guarantee your safety.”

“But if anyone doesn’t cooperate... Then we will kill all of you!”

Hearing this, many passengers turned pale with fright! One after another, they said, “We are willing to cooperate!”

After all, compared to money, life was more important!

The two robbers looked at each other, then took out a black sack and began to collect money one by one.

The police on the plane had been subdued and locked in the toilet long before.

No one could come to save them.

Soon, the two robbers came to Yang Jing’s side.

The two robbers looked at Yang Jing and then laughed evilly, “You look a little familiar. Are you Yang Jing?”

Yang Jing hurriedly pushed Qin Yu and said, “See? Even the robbers know me!”

The two robbers were stunned. They obviously couldn’t understand Yang Jing’s mentality.

“Wow, it’s really Yang Jing!” Someone outside also recognized Yang Jing.

“She’s a big star! If I knew she was here, I would have gone over and asked for an autograph!”

“Yang Jing, I’m your fan!” Someone outside even shouted!

This made Yang Jing even more proud. She wanted to show off to Qin Yu, but unfortunately, Qin Yu didn’t see the scene at all.

“A big star, huh? I see you on TV every day. I didn’t expect to see you here.” The two robbers laughed evilly.

Hearing this, Yang Jing remembered the current situation!

Her face instantly turned pale. She quickly took out the money and said, “I... I’m willing to give you all the money...”

“Only money? That won’t do.” The two robbers laughed evilly.

“There are still eighteen hours from now until the landing. It’s worth it to enjoy you for eighteen hours.”

After saying that, the two robbers slowly walked towards Yang Jing.

Yang Jing immediately panicked. She hurriedly shouted, “Get lost! I have already given you all the money!”

The robbers sneered. “If you don’t cooperate, I will kill everyone on this plane!”

When the passengers outside heard this, their expressions changed drastically!

“Miss Yang, please... just cooperate with them...”

“Yes, or we’ll all die here...”
