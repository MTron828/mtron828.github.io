2487 Xiao Sheng’s Might

The Judge’s Brush came the instant Qin Yu left the ghost realm and when the divine artifact knocked away the barrier between the two realms.

It was also Qin Yu’s most powerful technique at the moment.

However, people like Revered Qi would detect it almost immediately if this divine artifact was used, and Qin Yu could no longer keep it in his hands.

“I understand, Flower Granny.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and instantly felt the pressure coming at him like a mountain.

He did not know what that person was thinking. Perhaps he feared causing chaos in the human race, so he did not attack him.

However, the distrust was obvious. Teng Zixu’s arrival had blocked his escape route.

Perhaps the time to act was when the alliance completely controlled Human Race Watch.

Subsequently, in close to a month, the alliance sent many people.

Both parties communicated and made detailed communication under the command of the superior and subordinate to ensure Human Race Watch could cooperate with the alliance.

Just as Ji Yue had expected, after the higher-ups of the eight forces stationed themselves in Human Race Watch, nearly 800 cultivators left the alliance.

Fortunately, these people had yet to cultivate the Brilliance of Stars and Moon joint attack Technique. Therefore, they did not find it hard to accept them leaving.

Qin Yu and the others adopted the attitude of being out of sight and out of mind. They left these troublesome matters to Ji Yue.

He immediately began to cultivate in seclusion. However, he had not found his direction right now, so the progress of his cultivation was limited.

Nearly three months had passed. Qin Yu, Yan Ruoxue, Flower Granny, and Lei Xin had sparred with each other.

However, what frustrated him was that the gap between him and the three quickly shrunk.

If he did not go all out, he could not even defeat Yan Ruoxue, and that was under the premise that he was unsure if she had gone easy on him.

“Ding!”

Suddenly, a deafening bell rang from afar.

That sound of the bell rang out and joined as one in an instant, enveloping the entire Holy Region.

“Demon race’s invasion! All nearby cultivators, gather at the Gu family!”

The demon race, silent for nearly half a year, attacked again.

“We’ll go and help. You guys will support us later.”

Qin Yu frowned and said.

In an instant, he brought along his combat strength and set off immediately, regardless of public or private reasons.

He had to go and support them.

When they arrived, the land of the Gu family was almost completely unrecognizable.

Countless demons attacked the human cultivators, and people died every moment.

The blood on the ground had gradually gathered into a river.

Countless demons and cultivators entangled and fought to the death.

Yan Ruoxue instantly appeared in front of Saintess Gu, and the spatial shield appeared before her palms.

It blocked the charge of a tall demon with a massive shield on his back.

“Boom!”

The spatial shield shattered, and Yan Ruoxue’s body was forced back several thousand meters before she could eliminate the force. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“What a terrifying power! As expected of the divine beast, the black tortoise.”

Yan Ruoxue’s face was solemn.

“Thanks.”

Saintess Gu cupped her fists at Yan Ruoxue.

“The Road of Yin and Yang!”

Qin Yu held Evil Eye in his hand, and a vast path of life and death’s sword energy slashed out.

Hundreds of demons before him were instantly cut into halves.

The dead soul did not even struggle in time before it entered Evil Eye and became its tonic.

“What’s going on? Why did the demon race suddenly appear here? Don’t tell me you’re not on guard at all?”

Flower Granny asked with a frown.

Saintess Gu’s expression was tremendously ugly. She now understood why the Ni family was the first target of the demon race’s attack.

“Immortal Crane, you have attacked the human race several times in the past few years, but you have not gained anything. Why are you still attacking my Gu family?”

Gu Baiyi shouted. With the Vermillion Bird and Azure Dragon in front of her, she did not stand a chance to protect the Gu family.

“Who knows?”

Immortal Crane looked into the distance, and a strange smile appeared on his face.

For some reason, Gu Baiyi felt uneasy when she saw the smile on Immortal Crane’s face.

“Xiao Sheng, your old friends are here. Greet your friends.”

Immortal Crane said softly.

A figure stepped in the air and walked toward Qin Yu and the others. In an instant, an endless pressure landed on Qin Yu’s shoulder.

Thousand Shadows, Disillusion.

Xiao Sheng raised his fist and thousands of figures “split” before him.

These thousands of phantoms raised their fists at Qin Yu, Flower Granny, Lei Xin, Yan Ruoxue, and even many elders of the Gu family.

This punch actually encompassed all of them.

“Boom!”

Shocking fluctuations spread out from the entire world as the 1,000 figures punched at the same time.

The entire ground cracked, the rocks shattered, and the cracks extended deep into the ground.

The power of the earthquake reached the bottom of the ground, and countless magma and underground water gushed up.

An irresistible force gathered on Qin Yu’s resisting arms and violently flung his body away.

This power was similar to the power when he faced Gu Baiyi.

With the power of Xiao Sheng’s thousand fists at this point, countless Gu family members could not resist this destructive power and were either sent flying or buried under the ruins.

In an instant, this punch caused the death of four elders of the Gu family and many cultivators.

“Xiao Sheng!”

Qin Yu roared.

With a tap of his foot, he arrived before Xiao Sheng like a dragonfly skimming the water.

After that, he raised his fist high, and the clone of his soul arrived at the bottom of the sea of the Path of Heaven. Then, the power of the origin penetrated toward the tips of his fists.

It then flew toward Xiao Sheng’s head.

“It’s been so long, and is this all you’ve advanced?”

Xiao Sheng revealed a puzzled expression.

He shook his head and looked at Teng Zixu in the distance.

He then casually raised his fist and smashed it toward Qin Yu.

Before this instant, Qin Yu suddenly discovered to his horror the power of the origin that had penetrated the tip of his fists had completely disappeared for some reason.

Xiao Sheng’s punch seemed to have reversed the universe, and the power of the Path of Heaven he had triggered returned to the sea of the Path of Heaven again.

“Boom!”

With a punch, Xiao Sheng created a massive void in the space where Qin Yu was.

“Thanks, Ruoxue.”

Qin Yu’s forehead was drenched in cold sweat. At the last moment, Ruoxue used Spatial Displacement to move him away.

“What a terrifying strength! The surrounding power is all affected by his fist aura. This Spatial Displacement has almost consumed 30% of my spiritual energy.”

Yan Ruoxue was also tremendously shocked.
