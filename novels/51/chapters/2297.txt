2298 The Man with the Mustache’s Meritorious Deeds

“Did you guys notice that Situ Haoyue’s power of star is starting to grow dim?”

…

A moment later, Situ Haoyue finally stopped attacking. He stepped back and stared at Qin Yu, covered in blood.

At this moment, Qin Yu was in an incomparably miserable state. The skin on his body shattered, and blood was flowing all over the ground.

From the outside, one could see white bone in some places and even glimpse pulsating internal organs.

“Old dog Situ, why aren’t you continuing?”

Qin Yu laughed maniacally. Although his injury was severe at this moment, it would be very difficult for Situ Haoyue to defeat him if he could withstand this wave of attacks.

“Well, well. You said it. I hope you don’t regret it.”

Situ Haoyue seemed to be enraged.

His body rose higher and higher. In the air, in addition to the power of the stars, another gray internal qi of rules descended from the sky. His body gradually rose higher and higher, suspended in the air. Besides the power of the stars, a gray internal qi of rules descended from above.

It landed on his body like an immense thunder. In an instant, his body erupted with an even more ferocious internal qi.

The power of rules of the previous Path of Heaven!

At this moment, Situ Hao Yue was like a god. Two different lights filled his left and right eyes.

It was the power of two different Paths of Heaven. His feet were also wrapped in the gray power of rules of the previous Path of Heaven.

Qin Yu dared not be negligent in the slightest. He raised the spiritual power in his entire body to the limit.

The medicinal qi in the Sumeru ring was also frantically healing his injuries. He wanted to increase his combat prowess as much as possible.

Qin Yu’s expression was solemn. He took a deep breath and prepared to receive Situ Haoyue’s following attack.

“Whoosh!”

Situ Haoyue stomped his foot, and a gray mist suddenly exploded.

His body was like a stream of light, but he did not attack Qin Yu. Instead, he suddenly shot out.

Situ Haoyue actually escaped just like that!

The main thing was that Situ Haoyue’s aura was too magnificent. He did not expect him to escape.

“F*ck, this old fart is too shameless!”

“That’s right. This fellow is indeed worthy of living for so long. There’s a reason for this.”

The crowd discussed animatedly.

However, Qin Yu was still slightly relieved. If Situ Haoyue went all out, it was hard to say whether he could resist Situ Haoyue.

However, Situ Haoyue’s spiritual energy would probably be exhausted as well. At that time, he would also be putting himself in danger.

A person like him would never allow such a situation to happen.

However, Situ Haoyue’s last words caused many people to have strange expressions in their eyes.

Many people’s gazes staring at Qin Yu began to turn somewhat unfriendly.

“Go ahead if you want to make a move.”

Qin Yu’s body floated and entered the mountain peak where Situ Haoyue was.

As for Mei Li, she finally stood out at this moment. She stood before Qin Yu’s mountain peak and expressed her attitude.

She could not wait any longer. Adding icing to the cake was not as effective as providing timely help in a critical situation.

“Mei Li, what do you mean?”

“This kid is from the Holy Region. Are you helping him deal with the people of our galaxy?”

Someone asked bluntly.

“Qin Yu, I can only help you block these people. If the other cultivators on the other mountains attack, I can only block one person at most.”

Mei Li said with a frown.

“Thanks.”

Qin Yu said softly. He would remember this favor.

At this moment, Qin Yu, on the mountaintop, forcefully suppressed his weak internal qi. A powerful chaotic qi soared into the sky, intimidating the people on the other mountain peaks.

Cultivators like them would not make a move if they were not confident enough.

Otherwise, they would end up like Situ Haoyue, doing work for others with no benefit to themselves.

Elder Guai’s voice came from the Sumeru ring.

Qin Yu nodded and began absorbing the medicinal qi in the Sumeru ring. At the same time, he used the chaotic qi to heal his injuries.

Every second, his injuries were recovering much more than before.

However, the next moment, terrifying lightning of divine sense suddenly flashed across his mountain peak.

“Oh no, people from the other peaks have started probing.”

Qin Yu opened his eyes, his expression a little ugly.

The masked woman’s coffin and Suo Lin’s divine artifact were all powerful divine artifacts on him.

Even if these people obtained it, their strength would leap to another level. Therefore, they naturally would not give up so easily.

These people were basically the strongest in the entire galaxy. Not to mention the evil exterminator, people like Chang Ye and Xi Menn were not people that Qin Yu could match up to.

Although the others were not comparable to Gu Ming, the gap was not significant.

Once they made a move, Qin Yu probably would be in trouble.

Qin Yu took a deep breath, wanting to activate Suo Lin’s divine artifact to fight that divine sense.

“Qin Yu, release the coffin.”

The man with the mustache’s voice suddenly sounded.

“Alright.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Qin Yu practically did not even think about it and teleported the coffin to him.

The man with the mustache stood in front of the coffin, making complicated hand seals and the spiritual energy in his body was flowing on the coffin. A stream of green spiritual energy gathered on the coffin forming a complicated pattern.

“Boom!”

The coffin seemed to have been activated by something and suddenly let out a rumbling sound.

Under Qin Yu’s shocked gaze, the coffin suddenly opened.

A terrifying divine sense shot out from the pitch-black crack.

The enormous lightning of divine sense in the sky turned into ashes the moment it came into contact with this black divine sense.

A person on the surrounding mountain peak trembled violently. His face revealed a shocked expression, dared not continue probing.

The cultivators on the other peaks also seemed to have suddenly sensed a fierce beast’s divine sense. For a moment, they dared not continue probing.

“Qin Yu, this is the best I can do for now.”

The man with the mustache said solemnly.

Qin Yu nodded, sat cross-legged, and circulated the Traceless Immortal Scripture. The immense spiritual energy in the space poured into Qin Yu’s body like seawater.

“It’s still not enough!”

Qin Yu shook his head. The terrifying suction force of the Traceless Immortal Scripture was like a vortex, moving toward the bone cultivation water below him.

There was more bone cultivation water in this space than in the seventh level of purgatory, and the energy was purer.

An entire river of bone cultivation water poured out. It poured onto Qin Yu like a waterfall.

Under the overbearing suction force of the Traceless Immortal Scripture, the extreme energy contained in the bone cultivation water rushed into Qin Yu’s body.

It started to rage through Qin Yu’s limbs and bones frantically.
