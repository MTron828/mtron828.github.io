1813 Arriving at Zhongzhou

This was Qin Yu’s first time going to Zhongzhou. He had been curious about the aristocratic families in Zhongzhou.

He was not curious about the prosperity or the rich resources in this place, but about the Yan family!

Qin Yu really wanted to see what the Yan family was like.

In the next few days, he comprehended the Immortal Emperor’s Dao in the Thunderous Courtyard while waiting for the opportunity to go to Zhongzhou.

Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

On this day, everyone gathered at the array platform on the Demon-slaying Peak.

Jiu Xiao and the peak master had been waiting here for them.

The rest of the people arrived at the scene one after another.

When they saw Qin Yu, they said in surprise, “Qin Yu? What are you doing here? You haven’t given up yet?”

“I’m going to Zhongzhou too,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

“Don’t joke around. The eight people have already been chosen, you don’t stand a chance,” someone joked.

Even the peak master frowned.

“Qin Yu, what are you doing here? Hurry up and go back,” the peak master scolded.

Jiu Xiao shook his head and said, “I asked him to come.”

“Ah?” The peak Master was stunned. He asked with some confusion, “What do you mean?”

Jiu Xiao laughed. “I’m taking him out to see the world. Don’t worry. I won’t let him participate in this mission.”

Although the others were puzzled, this was Jiu Xiao’s decision, so they did not say anything more.

“We’ll leave in half an hour.” Jiu Xiao looked around.

“It’s not too late if you want to back out now,” the peak master said.

They were silent. Since they had already chosen to participate, no one was willing to leave.

Seeing this, the peak master did not say anything more.

Qin Yu and Jue Wu found a place to sit down and waited quietly.

Qin Yu was wondering about Zhongzhou.

Jue Wu, on the other hand, was staring at Jiu Xiao, mumbling to herself.

“What are you doing?” Qin Yu rolled his eyes.

“This b*stard is too arrogant. I will beat him up sooner or later,” Jue Wu said in determination.

“He’s actually a nice guy,” Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

“Humph.” Jue Wu snorted.

Qin Yu sighed silently.

This world had no lack of geniuses, for example, Xiao Sheng and Xiao Hai in Nanzhou, and now Jiu Xiao.

These people all possessed terrifying talents.

“Who do you think will win if Xiao Sheng and Jiu Xiao fight?” Jue Wu suddenly asked.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, then asked, “What do you think?”

Jue Wu rubbed her face and said, “I think Xiao Sheng should be better. I’ve fought with him before.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. He had the same thought.

If Xiao Sheng and Jiu Xiao were to fight, it would be hard to say who would win.

After all, Jiu Xiao had been in Thunderous Courtyard for so long. Not only was his cultivation realm higher than Xiao Sheng’s, but he also had more resources.

For example, Jiu Xiao had comprehended countless cultivation techniques from the first main peak.

But Xiao Sheng was different. He had figured out all his spells and techniques by himself.

At the mention of Xiao Sheng, Qin Yu thought about the situation in Nanzhou.

“I wonder how Xiao Sheng is doing right now.” Qin Yu sighed.

He didn’t know that the Tong family had already sent people to Nanzhou with Saint weapons.

However, in Qin Yu’s opinion, Xiao Sheng would definitely be fine. Even if he were to lose, he could still come to Thunder Courtyard to hide.

After all, Dean Lei had said that the gate of Thunder Courtyard was always open to him.

“Alright, everyone, let’s get onto the platform,” Jiu Xiao suddenly spoke.

One by one, the group went up the platform. Qin Yu did the same.

Standing on the platform, the peak master began to activate the array.

Beams of light shot up into the sky, and terrifying phantoms shook around them.

Soon, they disappeared into the darkness.

Just like the last time, the surroundings were dark, as if they were shuttling through the void.

However, this time, it took longer. After a long time, they saw light.

When they opened their eyes, they had already arrived at Zhongzhou.

This place was also a desert, and unlike the cities of the Crimson Moon Continent, Zhongzhou did not have any high walls at all. Instead, it was like a whole nation.

There were countless sects and families here, and the place had a different terrain.

For example, the land they were stepping on was a desert, but in front of them was an oasis. When they looked into the distance, they saw mountains. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Meet us here in five days.” At this time, Jiu Xiao looked at Qin Yu.

“During these five days, you are responsible for your own safety. If you cause any trouble, Thunder Courtyard will not clean up your mess.” Jiu Xiao reminded.

“Alright, thank you.” Qin Yu nodded quickly.

“Can I stay with Qin Yu?” Jue Wu asked.

“No.” Jiu Xiao’s face had a trace of anger.

Qin Yu quickly looked at Jue Wu and said, “It’s already good enough that I’m here. Besides, this mission is very dangerous. It needs all of you.”

“That’s fine.” Although Jue Wu wanted to stay with Qin Yu, she didn’t insist.

“Be careful,” she reminded.

“Don’t worry.” Qin Yu nodded.

After saying that, Qin Yu turned around and left, as if he didn’t want her to see that he had lied.

His speed was extremely fast, and he arrived at a street in a short while.

This street was extremely wide. It was more like a square.

The square was full of various items. Qin Yu released his divine sense and soon sensed several extremely terrifying auras.

Qin Yu could not see through the realms of many people.

It was Qin Yu’s first time coming to Zhongzhou, so he was full of curiosity.

He activated his desolate divine eye and looked into the distance.

With the support of the desolate divine eye, he saw one place after another that looked like a fairyland. He also saw many broken walls, as if they had been through a great battle.

“Those places must belong to the great aristocratic families,” Qin Yu thought.

Of course, Zhongzhou was so vast that it was impossible to find the Yan family so soon.

After much consideration, Qin Yu decided to ask around first.

So, Qin Yu went to a random stall and asked, “Bro, may I know how to get to the Yan family?”

The guy glanced at Qin Yu and said, “The Yan family? Which Yan family?”

“It’s the Yan family of the nine great aristocratic families,” Qin Yu said quickly.

“It is hundreds of thousands of stars away from here.” The guy laughed.

“That far?” Qin Yu frowned slightly. “If I walk there, five days won’t be enough.”

“Walk? Are you insane?” When the stall owner heard this, he was surprised.
