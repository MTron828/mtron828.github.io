Chapter 1330: Chapter 1,330, give me some face 

Wan ‘Er didn’t hide anything. She smiled and nodded. “Young Master Ling is right.”

“A cripple,”Ling Yun snorted coldly.

Wan ‘Er wasn’t angry. She only smiled and said, “I heard that Young Master Ling came to Yangcheng this time to look for someone?”

Hearing this, Ling Yun’s expression instantly became a little cold.

A wave of murderous intent rushed towards Wan ‘Er.

“What, are you here to plead for Qin Yu?”Ling Yun asked coldly.

Wan ‘er smiled and said, “Young Master Ling, you must be joking. I don’t have the qualifications.”

“It’s good that you know,”Ling Yun said coldly.

However, wan ‘er suddenly changed the topic and said, “I just hope that Young Master Ling doesn’t kill the innocent. I think that Qin Yu will definitely come to see you. Furthermore, it won’t be long.”

Ling Yun’s expression became even gloomier.

He didn’t reply. Instead, he stood up and said, “You know where Qin Yu is, right?”

“That’s right.”Wan ‘Er didn’t hide anything.

Ling Yun said coldly, “Then, I’ll take me to see him. Otherwise, I’ll kill you right now.”

“Young Master Ling, I’m really sorry. I Can’t take you to see him for the time being.”Wan ‘er shook her head.

“I think you’re looking for death!”Domain suddenly stretched out his hand, ready to grab Wan ‘er’s snow-white neck.

However, at this moment, wan ‘er lightly raised her hand and sent a palm strike towards Ling Yun.

Boom

A short explosion sounded. Both sides were simply testing each other.

However, under this palm strike, Ling Yun only felt waves of pain on his wrist.

Even Ling Yun felt a trace of danger from that powerful force.

His entourage also rushed to Ling Yun’s side.

“No wonder you dared to come in front of me and shout,”Ling Yun said coldly.

“It seems like your strength has recovered.”

Wan ‘Er didn’t say anything but smiled.

Ling Yun frowned as his mind raced.

“Then, when can I see Qin Yu?”Ling Yun asked coldly.

Wan ‘er was delighted, but she remained calm on the surface.

She made a simple calculation and said, “Three to five days.”

“Three days at most,”Ling Yun said coldly.

“If I don’t see Qin Yu in three days, I won’t give face to anyone.”

Wan ‘er was silent for a moment. She knew that this was Ling Yun’s bottom line. There was no point in arguing anymore.

Thus, she nodded and said, “Alright, three days then. Thank you, Young Master Ling.”

Then, Wan ‘er stood up and walked out of the teahouse.

Ling Yun’s gaze never left Wan ‘Er.

The killing intent in his eyes was like the cold winter of the twelfth lunar month.

After Wan ‘er walked far away, the attendant beside Ling Yun frowned and asked, “Young Master Ling, why are you giving her this face?”

Ling Yun snorted coldly and said, “I’m not afraid of her. I’m just worried that if we fight, both sides will be injured. At that time, I’m afraid that if we meet Qin Yu again, we will be doomed.”

The follower said in a deep voice, “Leave Wan ‘Er to me.”

Ling Yun glanced at him and said coldly, “You may not be her match.”

Hearing that, the follower couldn’t help but be shocked.

Zhao Wan ‘Er wasn’t much older than Ling Yun, yet she had such strength?

One had to know that this attendant was in the intermediate stage of the Almighty Realm!

“This Zhao family... I’ll remember it. When the matter is done, I’ll definitely bring people to flatten the Zhao family!”Ling Yun punched the table fiercely.

...

Chen family.

Chen Cang had also heard about this matter.

He sat in front of Qin Yu and said with a dark expression, “Qin Yu, it’s not that I don’t want to help you. It’s just that my Chen family can’t afford to offend the Tianyun sect. I Can’t afford to lose so many people just because of you.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly. “Old Mister Chen, I understand. Don’t worry, I will leave immediately.”

Chen Cang grunted in gratitude. He didn’t say anything else and waved his hand, indicating for Qin Yu to leave as soon as possible.

At this moment, wan ‘er walked in from outside the door.

Seeing Wan ‘er return, ah San hurriedly walked over.

“Miss Wan ‘er, you’re finally back. Ling Yun didn’t make things difficult for you, right?”Ah San said worriedly.

Wan ‘er shook her head. “No, it’s already settled. He promised to give us three days.”

Qin Yu looked at Wan ‘er and said in a deep voice, “I’m afraid it didn’t go as smoothly as you said.”

Wan ‘Er didn’t say anything, but her meaning was very obvious.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh in his heart.

Although this matter had been discussed temporarily, Qin Yu knew clearly that Wan ‘er had probably offended Ling Yun.

With Ling Yun’s character, he would definitely not let Wan ‘er off. He was afraid that he would settle the score later.

“Since that’s the case, we definitely can’t let Ling Yun leave Alive!”Qin Yu said coldly.

As long as Ling Yun died, this matter had nothing to do with Wan ‘Er.

“Young Master Qin, what did you say?”Wan ‘er asked doubtfully.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Miss Wan ‘er, thank you so much. I will remember this favor.”

“Young Master Qin, you are too polite. If it wasn’t for you, I wouldn’t have been able to recover my spiritual energy,”Wan ‘er said.

Although that was the case, Qin Yu knew in his heart that Wan ‘Er didn’t owe him a favor.

The two of them were partners in the first place. Since they were working together, they naturally had to split it equally. It had nothing to do with whether they owed him a favor or not.

“Let’s go,”Qin Yu stood up and said.

The group left the Chen family. Before they left, Chen Cang Handed Qin Yu a map and asked Qin Yu to bring it to sister Lin.

According to Chen Cang, this map was a map of the western ridge. If it was put up for auction, it would definitely fetch a good price.

The three of them found a hotel and stayed there temporarily.

“Young Master Qin, will three days be enough?”Wan ‘er asked.

Qin Yu looked at his palm and said, “I don’t know either.”

At this moment, his palm was once again wrapped in gauze. In order to recover as soon as possible, Qin Yu used a lot of herbs.

“Qin Yu, you don’t even have any spiritual energy in your body. Are you a match for Ling Yun?”Ah San couldn’t help but ask.

Qin Yu sneered. “I fought with him once. This time, I will definitely kill him!”

This New Right Fist possessed unimaginable power.

As long as his injuries recovered, Qin Yu was full of confidence.

“Young Master Qin, do you need my help?”Wan ‘er asked.

Qin Yu hurriedly waved his hand and said, “No need. You have already helped me a lot.”

“Sigh, I originally planned to ask for five days, but unfortunately I was rejected.”Wan ‘er sighed slightly.

Qin Yu cupped his hands and said, “Three days is enough. Thank you, Miss Wan ‘Er.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Then I Won’t disturb your rest. If you need anything, just call me,”Wan ‘er said.

After saying this, she and Ah San walked out of the room.
