Chapter 2703: The Appearance of Sandworms

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Tu Ku didn’t move. Suddenly, he revealed a strange smile.

Then, he moved his arm.

“Be careful!”

Qin Yu shouted and pulled Xi Ming back.

Almost instantly, a shocking saber light swept past his head.

Then, it slashed into the hard wall of the mine, leaving a deep and sharp mark.

If not for Qin Yu’s pull, his head would have been chopped off by this saber light.

“You’re courting death!”

Xi Ming’s face was filled with rage. A talisman had already landed in his hand.

“Don’t be anxious. Take a look first. Their condition doesn’t seem right.”

Qin Yu stared at that person. After he slashed, he continued to attack elsewhere.

Moreover, there were many wounds on his body at the moment. Suddenly, intense fluctuations came from the room.

One of the walls exploded, revealing three other figures.

The four of them were attacking crazily. However, it was as if they were drunk and were attacking randomly.

“Something is wrong. The internal qi on their bodies is very weak. They seem to have been bewitched. They don’t even know that we are here.” Xi Ming frowned slightly. He took a deep breath and shouted.

A visible sound wave was transmitted to the four of them.

However, the four of them still maintained their original state and attacked each other randomly after a short pause.

“Even Dao Mind Interrogation is useless? What happened?” Xi Ming’s expression was solemn.

Suddenly, a woman’s head was chopped off by Tu Ku.

Blood splattered all over the room. Qin Yu quickly covered the little boy’s eyes.

However, something strange happened. Even though the woman’s head had fallen off, her hands and feet continued to attack. Her eyes were still fixed on Qin Yu and Xi Ming and she even roared.

“Capture them first before we investigate the situation in detail!”

Qin Yu put the little boy down.

Ling Bo!

With a stomp of his feet, he had already arrived inside the house.

After a fight, Qin Yu directly broke their legs.

However, something even stranger happened. The broken legs kept shaking. “Are they poisoned? Why do I feel like they’re living dead?”

Xi Ming felt a chill down his spine. He had never seen such a strange scene before.

“No. Look at their moves. Although the directions are a little chaotic and it looks like a random fight, the Walking Dead can’t perform a slash like Tu Ku just now.”

Qin Yu said with a frown.

He stared at the beheaded woman. At this moment, the woman was still alive!

Although the life internal qi was very weak, she was indeed not dead.

Qin Yu felt his scalp tingle but he found something new after checking them.

There was an identical mark on each of their foreheads.

It was a strange Buddha statue! It was formed by countless ferocious-looking babies! Although it looked like a Buddha, the expression was like the most terrifying evil ghost!

Qin Yu turned around and saw a twisted smile behind him. Who else could it be but Xi Ming?

“F*ck!

Qin Yu’s hair stood on end and he kicked Xi Ming away.

At this moment, Xi Ming had a terrified expression. Then, he started to act like everyone else.

Qin Yu carried the little boy and left abruptly. Cold sweat broke out on his back.

How did Xi Ming fall for it? They did not smell any strange smell, nor did they eat anything inside the house. They could not even sense any fluctuation of formation qi.

Besides, why was he and the little boy were fine?

Qin Yu carried the little boy with a solemn expression. Now, Xi Ming had also become like this.

There was no one to lead the way. He hesitated for a moment and decided to take the little boy back.

The situation here had exceeded his imagination. This unforeseen event was no longer something that his current strength could resolve.

If he were to stay here, he would probably end up like these people.

Moreover, he was in a very poor state at the moment. He was already beginning to feel a huge pressure.

It was as if there was a mountain pressing down on his divine soul, which made him feel extremely uneasy.

Suddenly, a slight vibration came from behind Qin Yu.

Fleeing Shadow!

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically.

The tunnel he was in just now completely collapsed. The huge vibration made Qin Yu’s internal organs feel wrong.

Qin Yu’s face was pale. The ore content here was very high.

That was why the entire mine was extremely hard. He only left some marks when he fought with Xi Ming.

What kind of power could cause the entire passage to collapse?

Crack!

A stone slowly fell and the rubble of the collapsed passage shook slightly.

“Nine Heavens Holy Sword!”

Qin Yu’s Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze suddenly opened.

Qin Yu grabbed the little boy and retreated using Ling Bo.

An extreme sense of danger arose in his sea of consciousness. Silver holy energy shot out of his pores.

All the power in the holy bones was channeled into his left hand.

“Vast Qi of Milky Way!”

The holy energy of the Milky Way gushed out of his left hand. The world in front of him became a galaxy.

Boom!

The entire tunnel suddenly trembled slightly. A black shadow that was difficult to catch directly collided with Qin Yu.

The Nine Heavens Holy Sword and the Vast Qi of Milky Way instantly dissipated when they hit it, like an egg hitting a rock.

Qin Yu was scared out of his wits. What the f*ck was this?

His two ultimate attacks did not even have the slightest effect.

Boom!

A terrifying vibration sounded. Qin Yu closed his eyes in despair.

This was no longer a gap that could be made up by risking his life. Terrifying vibrations spread out from the surroundings.

A woman had appeared in front of Qin Yu.

At this moment, her fair palm was in front of him, blocking a huge insect-like body in front of them.

Her seemingly weak palm actually blocked that terrifying impact.

The woman’s eyes were as cold as jade and her aura was as elegant as the moon. She was like a female immortal from the nine heavens. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The internal qi on his body gave Qin Yu a very familiar feeling. It was a little similar to Teng Zixu and Zhu Xie.

She exuded the internal qi of Heaven.

Hah!

With a soft shout, the woman raised her right fist.

As she swung her fist, the space around her turned upside down. Countless fist shadows overlapped in front of Qin Yu.

Countless fist shadows seemed to be overlapping in slow motion when they bombarded the monster in front of them.

Instantly, a sound comparable to a thunderstorm exploded in Qin Yu’s eardrums.

Blood gushed out of his ears and his expression changed drastically. Fortunately, he had protected the little boy’s eardrums in time.. Otherwise, he might have been directly killed by this vibration!
