Chapter 1119: Chapter 1119, peering into the world beneath the sea! 

The moment the blood essence entered the desolate God’s eye, it immediately emitted an extremely dazzling light!

This light was almost incandescent as it shot towards Qin Yu’s glabella!

“Swoosh!”

The light pierced through Qin Yu’s glabella and directly entered his mind!

In an instant, Qin Yu’s mind seemed to explode. His brain was in excruciating pain. The intense pain caused Qin Yu’s eyes to turn scarlet red, as though his eyeballs were about to explode!

“Ah...”Qin Yu’s mouth emitted a painful wail. He half-knelt on the ground, his entire mind spinning!

This kind of pain was close to divine sense. Even his primordial spirit was throbbing at this moment!

Wang Zhou, who was at the side, was also greatly shocked when he saw this. He took two steps back with some vigilance, staring fixedly at Qin Yu who was curled up on the ground!

This kind of pain did not know how long it lasted, and Qin Yu’s spirit was almost about to wither.

If Wang Zhou attacked now, Qin Yu would not be able to resist at all!

Fortunately, Wang Zhou did not intend to attack. He just stood there and watched quietly.

The light entered Qin Yu’s mind. A few minutes later, a ray of light flashed between Qin Yu’s brows.

The lingering pain also began to slowly disappear.

At this moment, Qin Yu was covered in sweat. The clothes on his body were also drenched in sweat.

He slowly stood up from the ground and touched his body with lingering fear.

Fortunately, nothing happened.

“Senior, are you okay?”Wang Zhou walked forward and asked.

Qin Yu looked at Wang Zhou and shook his head. “I don’t feel anything.”

He tried to feel the space between his eyebrows, but he only felt that the space between his eyebrows was hot.

Qin Yu’s mind moved, and a light immediately lit up between his eyebrows.

And this light was the desolate God’s eye!

“Desolate God’s eye, it really is the desolate God’s eye!”Wang Zhou said with some excitement.

With the support of the desolate God’s eye, Qin Yu’s vision could penetrate tens of thousands of miles, and he could even see through the world under the sea!

“This...”Qin Yu could not help but be stunned.

It seemed that Wang Zhou was right. This desolate God’s eye was really a holy item!

Following that, Qin Yu swept his gaze around. He felt as if he had the Golden Eyes of fire, almost piercing through this space!

“With the desolate God’s eye, won’t I be able to see what is hidden under the sea?”Qin Yu was pleasantly surprised!

Thinking of this, Qin Yu could not help but turn around and cupped his hands towards Wang Zhou.

“Thank you!”Qin Yu said sincerely.

Wang Zhou said with slight fear, “Senior, you are too polite. I was just pushing the boat along with the current.”

Qin Yu could not help but smile bitterly and said, “If you want to talk about senior, I should call you senior. Regardless of age or knowledge, you are above me.”

This made Wang Zhou somewhat surprised.

He sized up Qin Yu from head to toe, as if guessing Qin Yu’s age.

Qin Yu said, “I’m only in my early thirties. How can I be called a Senior?”

“Early thirties? You have such a cultivation in your early thirties?”Wang Zhou was even more surprised.

His disciple beside him exclaimed, “You can’t be that Qin Yu, right?”

“You’ve heard of me?”Qin Yu said in surprise.

“So you are the famous Qin Yu. My eyes are poor.”Wang Zhou cupped his hands again.

Qin Yu hurriedly returned the bow and said, “I owe you a favor. I will definitely repay the favor of the desolate God’s eye in the future.”

“Are you serious?”Wang Zhou asked in surprise.

Qin Yu was stunned for a moment before saying, “I’ll do as I say.”

Wang Zhou said with some embarrassment, “I really have something to ask of you.”

“Feel free to say it.”Qin Yu nodded.

Wang Zhou said in a deep voice, “The divine firmament sect is affiliated to the divine firmament sect, but now there are only the two of US left in the entire sect. It has always been the wish of the two of us to belong to the divine firmament sect and become its disciple.”

“Now that the Holy Region has opened, if there’s a chance, I would like to ask Mr. Qin to help me find the divine firmament sect!”

Qin Yu was stunned and could not help but smile bitterly. “You think too highly of me. The holy region is vast and boundless, and there are many top-notch martial artist. I might not have the ability.”

Upon saying this, Qin Yu paused for a moment before he continued, “Of course, if I have the chance, I will definitely pay a visit to the divine firmament sect.”

“Thank you.”Wang Zhou nodded slightly.

The two of them did not stay any longer. After chatting for a while, they left the place.

Qin Yu did not waste any time either. He looked at the surface of the sea, intending to go under the sea to investigate.

No one knew if the sea was as Qin Yu had guessed. There was another world under the sea.

But before heading to the saint-level, Qin Yu had to figure it out.

“With my body, it shouldn’t be a problem for me to sink down to ten thousand meters,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

If he were to forcefully dive down, he could even reach fifteen thousand meters. But that was definitely the limit of his body.

Now that he had the desolate divine eye, he could observe a very long distance under the sea. He might be able to discover something.

Qin Yu did not waste any more time. He immediately dove into the sea and sank down.

After reaching a distance of 10,000 meters under the sea, Qin Yu could already feel the pressure under the sea. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

He did not dare to be negligent. He immediately used his azure wood body and continued diving.

With the support of the Azure Wood body, Qin Yu reached a distance of more than 10,000 meters under the sea.

The immense pressure around him caused cracks to appear on his body.

“This is already my limit.”Qin Yu looked at his body. At this moment, cracks were beginning to appear on his azure wood body. Once the azure wood body shattered, the pressure could instantly crush Qin Yu into meat paste.

As such, Qin Yu’s body floated there. Following that, with a thought, he activated his desolate God’s eye and looked down.

The instant he activated his desolate God’s eye, Qin Yu’s glabella immediately lit up. His eyes looked down thousands of meters!
