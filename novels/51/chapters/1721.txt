Chapter 1722: Yuan Xiu Fought Against Xiao Sheng Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The disciples of Tianyun Sect were like ants in the eyes of Yuan Xiu.

Yuan Xiu looked down on those people as if he was a god.

Yuan Xiu said coldly, “A bunch of ants, you are going to die.”

He raised his hands, and a black light wrapped around his arms as if he was about to use some terrifying technique.

The disciples of Tianyun Sect were panicking. In the face of such a terrifying internal qi, they could not even think of resisting.

!!

At that moment, a phantom appeared in front of Yuan Xiu.

It was Xiao Sheng. With his hands on his back, Xiao Sheng said, “Yuan Xiu, I’ve been waiting for you for a long time.”

Yuan Xiu raised his eyebrows and sneered, “Xiao Sheng, you’re about to pay for your arrogance.”

Xiao Sheng laughed indifferently and then said, “Is that so? I’ll be waiting for you on the mountain ahead. You don’t have to attack those innocent people.”

“Alright, I’ll deal with these people after I kill you!” Yuan Xiu snorted.

After saying that, Yuan Xiu retracted the internal qi in his hand. He looked at the tall mountain not far away and led the group straight toward it.

The news that Yuan Xiu had arrived in Nanzhou had already spread throughout the entire area.

Everyone rushed to tell their friends and family, afraid that someone would miss the news.

Although many of those people were afraid of Yuan Xiu, they still did not want to miss such a huge battle. Countless people had heard the news and came over.

On the mountain, Xiao Sheng put his hands on his back and quietly waited for Yuan Xius to arrive.

And there were many cultivators of Reversion Void Stage hiding and observing everything quietly.

This was an unprecedented battle. Dark clouds were looming before Yuan Xiu arrived, as if something terrifying was going to happen.

Xiao Sheng’s internal qi was still as calm as ever, like an ancient well, so deep that its bottom could not be seen.

Very quickly, Yuan Xiu led his men to the location.

Countless cultivators from North Plain had completely surrounded the mountain, and no one could escape.

Meanwhile, Yuan Xiu led Sima Bei and Yong Ji toward Xiao Sheng.

Faced with Xiao Sheng, Yuan Xiu and Sima Bei felt an indescribable tension. Their expressions were extremely unnatural.

Yuan Xiu seemed to have noticed this. He glanced at the two of them and said indifferently, “Xiao Sheng is only at the half-step Reversion Void Stage. Why do you look fearful?”

That was true, but Xiao Sheng had been terrifying the two of them for such a long time. Even now, they were still unconsciously afraid of him.

“Long time no see, Sima Bei.”

At this moment, Xiao Sheng took the initiative to speak.

Sima Bei’s body tensed up, and his expression turned terrible.

He braced himself and said, “Alright. Well, how do you do?”

“You’re pretty polite to him, huh?” Yuan Xiu was instantly enraged and glared coldly at Sima Bei. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Then Sima Bei realized his mistake. He quickly added, “Xiao Sheng, you have occupied Nanzhou for too long. You are going to die today!”

Even though these words were not very imposing, they still expressed Sima Bei’s courage.

Hence, Yuan Xiu turned his attention to Yong Ji.

Yong Ji did not fear Xiao Sheng as much as he did before, and his expression was rather calm.

Yong Ji stood behind Yuan Xiu and said indifferently, “Xiao Sheng, it’s all because of you that I’m here today. Without you, Eternal City would have been the most powerful city in Nanzhou, and all my plans would have been smooth-sailing.”

“You’re like a huge mountain that I can’t overcome. No matter how hard I try, I can’t surpass you. So, I can only seek shelter in North Plain.”

Xiao Sheng looked at Yong Ji and said calmly, “You’ve overestimated yourself. To be honest, I don’t have much of an impression of you. If you hadn’t led your men to attack Tianyun Sect, I might have forgotten you very quickly.”

Yong Ji felt really embarrassed after he heard Xiao Sheng’s words.

Xiao Sheng was clearly looking down on Yong Ji. Yong Ji was definitely no match for Xiao Sheng. Xiao Sheng did not even remember there was a man named Yong Ji.

Xiao Sheng continued, “Of the three lunatics and the three extremes, you, Yong Ji, should be the weakest one.”

“Nonsense!” Yong Ji got furious at that time.

“The three lunatics and the three extremes were no match for me! Xiao Sheng, you’re full of nonsense. What are your intentions?” Yong Ji gritted his teeth, looking extremely furious.

Xiao Sheng sighed slightly and said, “Can you please just take a look at yourself? Yong Ji, don’t lie to yourself anymore.”

“How dare you!” Yong Ji was so angry that he did not know what he should say now.

He used to be the high and mighty Mr. Yong Ji, respected by tens of thousands of people. Countless people wanted to be his disciples, and countless people regarded him as their role model and idol.

However, during this period of time, Yong Ji suffered an unprecedented blow. Almost everyone was looking down on him.

“Xiao Sheng, you d*mn b*stard!” Yong Ji roared in anger.

“I’ll kill you today and let you pay for your arrogance!”

Yuan Xiu nodded his head slightly and said with satisfaction, “That’s right, then you can make the first move.”

Yong Ji was stunned. He subconsciously took a step back and returned to Yuan Xiu’s back.

“What? Are you frightened now?” Yuan Xiu said with a terrible expression.

Yong Ji said, “No. I am not frightened. I just don’t want to steal your thunder.”

“Bullsh*t!” Yuan Xiu snorted.

Yuan Xiu then looked at Xiao Sheng and said, “Xiao Sheng, you should know very well that you’re going to die today.”

Xiao Sheng looked at the three of them and said, “If the three of you attack me at the same time, my chances of winning are indeed very slim, but I don’t think you will do that.”

“Ha ha ha ha!” Yuan Xiu couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

He looked coldly at Xiao Sheng and said, “You’re right. It won’t happen for the time being. But if something unexpected happens, I’ll have to kill you first.”

Obviously, even Yuan Xiu was not one hundred percent confident.

Yuan Xiu said indifferently, “Xiao Sheng, your name has been lingering in my ears for many years. Everyone is talking about how powerful you are and your glorious history. I am tired of it.”

“I’m extremely curious about you.”

“Then there’s no need for any more nonsense. Make your move,” Xiao Sheng said calmly.

Yuan Xiu squinted his eyes and the internal qi on his body began to accumulate rapidly.

A terrifying internal qi lingered around the entire mountain. It was only the beginning, but the mountain began to collapse.

With Yuan Xiu as the center, a powerful internal qi swept out in all directions.

The people who were hiding in the void and watching this were all shaken down. Those who were weak even spat out blood.

A powerful internal qi came out from Yuan Xiu’s body, and waves of shock waves were emitted from his body.

Everyone’s expression changed drastically when they sensed the terrifying internal qi of Yuan Xiu.

It was too terrifying.

Even though they were all at Reversion Void Stage, Yuan Xiu was clearly more powerful than the others.

Compared to Zhao Jing, Yuan Xiu was much more terrifying.
