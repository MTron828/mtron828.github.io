Chapter 497: Gu Canghai Personally Takes Action! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s shocking words had immediately attracted the attention of countless people!

No one had expected that after Qin Yu had ruined the Saint Confucian Sect, not only did he not lie low, he had even taken the initiative to provoke them!

To fight to the death with the Saint Confucian Sect? One had to know that that was the north’s number one sect, with Martial Marquises overseeing it!

The Yan family of Jingdu, one of the largest aristocratic families in Pyro, was its backer!

Qin Yu wanted to fight against the entire Saint Confucian Sect all by himself? It was simply unimaginable!

On the other side, after Yan Sihai had hung up the phone, the military advisor walked in.

He leaned over Yan Sihai’s ear and recounted the entire incident, word by word. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

After Yan Sihai heard it all, his expression immediately turned a little ugly.

“You said that Qin Yu had beheaded ten half step Martial Marquises?” Yan Sihai’s eyes were filled with doubt.

The military advisor nodded and said, “To be precise, there were nine. One of them was let go by Qin Yu.”

Yan Sihai’s expression was a little ugly.

He had never expected that Qin Yu’s growth speed would be so fast!

He had never expected that after Qin Yu stepped into the half-step Martial Marquis realm, he would actually have such strength!

One against ten was simply unheard of!

“How exactly did I let him grow up under my eyes?” Yan Sihai rubbed his temples while feeling a headache for a moment.

The military advisor said, “Don’t worry. There are strong and weak half-step Martial Marquises. How can those people be compared to Young Master Han?”

This was the truth. As the Young Master of an aristocratic family, he naturally had an absolute advantage among those of the same level.

“If it really doesn’t work, we can send out Martial Marquises and directly kill Qin Yu,” said the military advisor.

Yan Sihai was silent for a moment, then said, “On September 9th, gather all the martial artists that the Yan family can gather and secretly set up an ambush.”

“Remember, no matter what, we can’t let Qin Yu leave Jingdu!”

The military advisor nodded and said, “Yes, Mr. Yan.”

...

Yan family manor.

On Yan Ruoxue’s bedside, there was a calendar.

Seeing that September 9th was getting closer and closer, Yan Ruoxue also became somewhat anxious and uneasy.

“Miss, don’t be too worried. No matter what, you should live your life. Don’t let it affect your health,” the nanny beside reminded her.

Yan Ruoxue glanced at the nanny and shook her head. “I’m very worried. Qin Yu...”

Yan Ruoxue didn’t continue.

She was afraid that she would really have to marry Han Wei, but she was also afraid that Qin Yu would really come to stop the marriage.

As the daughter of the Yan family, she naturally knew how powerful the Yan family was.

Putting aside whether Qin Yu could defeat Han Wei, just the kind of powerful people that the Yan family could mobilize was definitely not something that an ordinary person could compare to.

“Miss, since you have chosen to trust Mr. Qin, don’t worry too much about it.” The nanny at the side advised.

Yan Ruoxue nodded and didn’t say anything more.

... . .

There was only one month left until September 9th, and Han Wei still hadn’t come out from his closed door cultivation.

He had been staying at the Jingdu Martial Arts Association all day while enjoying Pyro’s top-notch martial arts resources.

The Han family.

“Mr. Xia, what exactly is Han Wei’s situation?” Said Han Meng with some uneasiness.

He also heard about Qin Yu beheading ten half-step Martial Marquises, so it was impossible for him not to worry.

Xia Hang laughs way: “Mr. Han, don’t worry, we still have a month’s time. Everything is possible.”

“Everything is possible? What do you mean? Could it be that he could step into the realm of Martial Marquis?” Han Wei said with puzzlement.

Xia Hang shook his head and said, “The possibility of stepping into the realm of Martial Marquis is not high. In half a month’s time, no matter how capable he is, he can’t do it.”

“However... we have a way to ensure that he will win.” Xia Hang changed the topic and said with a nonchalant smile.

Han Meng frowned and said, “What do you mean?”

Xia Hang narrowed his eyes and said with a sneer, “Jingdu Martial Arts Association has the oldest cultivation methods in the world!”

“Even if we can’t let Han Wei truly step into the realm of Martial Marquis, we still have a way to let him obtain the same power as a Martial Marquis!”

Hearing this, Han Wei was relieved.

After all, the level of a Martial Marquis and a half-step Martial Marquis were two different worlds.

...

Qin Yu sat in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s elder residence. His eyes were closed as he slowly recovered his internal qi.

In the square, the First Elder was still kneeling there and suffering all day long.

At this moment, the Fifth Elder pushed the Second Elder in.

“Qin Yu, how is the Pavilion Master?” The Second Elder asked.

Qin Yu said, “Second Elder, don’t worry. She has been brought to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. I will think of a way to save her as soon as possible.”

The Second Elder nodded. He sighed. “The Pavilion Master was right.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly. “If it weren’t for me, the Pavilion Master wouldn’t have suffered so much.”

The Second Elder didn’t say anything.

“Rest well.” The Second Elder didn’t stay any longer and left.

After the Second Elder left, Qin Yu turned on his phone.

Qin Yu’s power was still being publicized on the Martial Arts Forum, but Qin Yu knew very well that he hadn’t stepped into the half-step Martial Marquis realm.

There was still a fine line between him and the half-step Martial Marquis realm.

If he wanted to officially step into the half-step Martial Marquis realm, he still needed a reincarnation pill.

“Where can I find 5,000-year-old herbs?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

“I wonder if the Pavilion Master has any ideas.”

Since she was the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, Ji Yuhong’s herbal resources was incomparable.

It was just that... She was currently locked up in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association and couldn’t be contacted at all.

“I have to think of a way to rescue the Pavilion Master as soon as possible,” Qin Yu’s expression darkened as he said coldly.

In the next few days, Qin Yu didn’t leave the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

He sat in the Elder’s manor all day, and from time to time, there would be explosions and bright lights.

No one knew what Qin Yu was doing, but everyone regarded Qin Yu as their savior.

...

The Saint Confucian Sect.

On this day, Gu Canghai rushed back to the Saint Confucian Sect from Jingdu.

Ever since he heard about Qin Yu’s deeds, he didn’t dare to waste any time.

“This... this...”

Looking at the messy Saint Confucian Sect, Gu Canghai stood there in a daze, as if he was stunned.

The entire Saint Confucian Sect was filled with broken walls and dried corpses. There was not a single trace of life!

How was this the number one sect in the north? It was simply like a graveyard!

“Qin Yu... Qin Yu!!”

Gu Canghai was furious!

“You dared to treat the Saint Confucian Sect like this? I want you dead! I want you dead!!” Gu Canghai raised his head and roared angrily!

Then, he stepped inside the Saint Confucian Sect!

After he returned, the disciples of the Saint Confucian Sect also walked out one after another.

In front of the villa, hundreds of disciples were kneeling on the ground.

Elder Qu was in front of them.

“What the h*ll is going on?” Gu Canghai looked at Elder Qu coldly.

Elder Qu hurriedly said, “Qin Yu was too strong! He broke four Martial Marquis Weapons single handedly. We weren’t his match at all!”

Gu Canghai gritted his teeth and shouted angrily, “Trash, you trash!”

Elder Qu didn’t say a word and held his breath.

Gu Canghai took a deep breath and forcefully suppressed the anger in his heart.

He coldly swept his gaze across the crowd and said, “The Saint Confucian Sect has never suffered such humiliation! If I don’t kill him, the Saint Confucian Sect’s reputation will be ruined!”

“From today onwards, I will personally take action to capture Qin Yu!”
