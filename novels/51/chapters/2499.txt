2500 The Si Family’s Shiyue

“Flower Granny Hua’s Path of Time, Jun Yixian’s Path of Reincarnation, Senior Wu Ji’s Way of Destruction, Xiao Sheng, and the masked woman’s fusion of nine paths. All indeed have their respective paths. This world will become more interesting if we put aside the grudges between the families.”

He suddenly understood the loneliness of Senior Wu Ji.

During the Degenerate Age, he was indeed the only one, that lonely genius.

“Oh yes, Ruoxue, you’ll be controlling this Sumeru ring in the future. I’m gradually stripping the connection between my soul and the Sumeru World.”

Qin Yu put the ring on Yan Ruoxue’s fair finger.

Like the Heart of Thunder, Yan Ruoxue and Lei Xin were on a single path.

This kind of treasure with unique attributes could display its ultimate effect on them.

The Sumeru World was more like a functional treasure in Qin Yu’s hands, and it would be more useful in Yan Ruoxue’s hands.

During their recent dual cultivation sessions, Yan Ruoxue’s comprehension of the Way of Space was far beyond Qin Yu’s.

In the Dual Cultivation of Souls this time, Qin Yu virtually comprehended the most.

Although this magical artifact was an item of the Tribulation Transcending stage, it also fused a vast amount of Sumeru qi within. It even combined with Green Spirit Tree and other supreme treasures. It also faintly had the embryonic form of a half-celestial artifact.

“No, this magical artifact is also a life-saving divine tool if you’re defeated in battle.”

Yan Ruoxue shook her head and withdrew her hand.

“Is your husband that weak in your eyes?”

Qin Yu flicked her forehead fiercely and put it on Yan Ruoxue’s finger, regardless of her objection.

Suddenly, both of them almost sensed at the same time a massive energy vibration coming from afar.

When they returned to Huaning Mountain from the Sumeru World, they immediately saw the power of thunderclouds coming from a tremendously distant place.

“That’s the direction of the Si family. Si Shiyue is coming out of seclusion soon.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Si Shiyue had been in seclusion for nearly a hundred years. He might have gained a lot from this seclusion.

He comprehended the five elements concurrently, which was different from many people.

Most importantly, one of the powers involved billions of changes.

Comprehending five powers at the same time required a lot of effort, and ordinary cultivators could not do it.

In the sky, enormous thunderclouds surged.

Amidst the thunders and lightning that filled the sky, nine enormous thunder dragons slowly formed.

“Nine Dragon Thunder Tribulation! Another Nine Dragon Thunder Tribulation!”

The entire Si family was in a frenzy. The appearance of the dragon thunder tribulation meant Si Shiyue had gained a lot from his seclusion.

That was why the Path of Heaven sent such a terrifying thunder tribulation.

“The power of this thunder tribulation seems even more terrifying than mine back then.”

Yan Ruoxue said softly.

The Nine Dragon Thunder Tribulation was a backlash from the Path of Heaven’s threat to cultivators. One could also see the cultivator’s energy from it.

“Si Shiyue must have made an extraordinary breakthrough. Look, the thundercloud energy is still non-stop brewing. Although the number nine is the limit, it’s similar to the Tribulation Fifth Level in that the disparity in between is tremendous.”

Flower Granny said with a solemn expression.

Before she finished speaking, the massive energy fluctuation in the sky had already caused the ground to tremble.

“Summon all the family’s cultivators to return and protect the Holy Son.”

Si Liuhe looked solemn.

While he was giving out orders, Revered Qi and the other higher-ups arrived.

“With us around, no one can interfere with Si Shiyue’s tribulation.”

Revered Qi looked at the Nine Dragon Lightning Tribulation, and his voice sounded ethereal.

He looked into the depths of the Azure Rock Forest. At this moment, the power of heaven and earth also attracted the demon race.

Many from the demon race with powerful internal qi lurked nearby, and their thoughts remained unknown.

“Thank you for coming, Revered Qi.”

Si Liuhe heaved a sigh of relief.

With the arrival of the alliance, it would not be easy for even the demon race to make a move.

In an instant, the ground began to tremble, mountains collapsed, and rivers flowed upstream.

The entire Holy Region was impacted by the power of the thunder tribulation. Countless ordinary people scrambled to take cover, feeling an unprecedented fear and despair.

At this moment, a layer of silver light covered Si Shiyue’s body. He raised his head and walked toward the Nine Dragon Thunder Tribulation step by step.

He was as if strolling in the fields.

Following his path to heaven, the power of the thunder tribulation that approached him became gentle. After that, the power of the thunder tribulation condensed in his palm.

“Xiao Sheng, what do you think?” Immortal Crane asked with a smile.

“Very powerful…”

Xiao Sheng stared at Si Shiyue with a rare strong battle intent on his face.

He could sense the terrifying battle prowess of the technique.

At this moment, the space trembled, and 20 people or so suddenly descended from the space.

With their appearance, the might of the heaven and earth seemed to have slightly weakened.

“Who are these humans? They have terrifying strength! We don’t seem to have seen them among the human race before.”

Jue Wu slightly sensed it, and her face instantly turned ashen.

Each of these people was as unfathomable as Flower Granny and Lei Xin, and one of them seemed to have sensed her prying.

With a move of divine sense, it almost shattered her divine sense.

“They should be from the four sects and four schools. The people from the Ten Thousand Buddha Sect are among them.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Qin Yu felt a familiar fluctuation. Those monks should be from the Ten Thousand Buddha Sect.

“Si Shiyue’s breakthrough seemed to have attracted the attention of many people. Even the four sects and four clans, which have never appeared before, have shown up. Could it be a change?”

Lei Xin frowned.

For a Tribulation Transcending cultivator, even if he had triggered the Nine Dragons Thunder Tribulation, such a crowd was indeed too big.

“Could it be that Si Shiyue’s talent has also made the alien race feel threatened? Otherwise, there’s no reason for the four sects and four schools to appear here.”

The power of the five elements surrounded Si Shiyue, and the five types of powers of the origin intertwined with each other.

That power perfectly avoided the restraining Path of Heaven.

Wood generated fire.

The fire generated earth.

Earth generated metal.

Metal generated water.

Water generated wood.

In an instant, the obscure and complicated Path of Heaven entangled within.

The violent power even tore apart the thunderclouds in the sky. Si Shiyue shook his head.

He was a little disappointed with the Nine Dragon Thunder Tribulation.

As if sensing the contempt, the thundercloud suddenly condensed 10,000 meters in the air again. At this moment, the thundercloud condensed into a cluster of tremendously red gas.

With the appearance of the red thundercloud, the entire Holy Region suddenly turned blood-red.

A strong wind blew, lightning flew, and thunder rumbled.

Floods, tornadoes, and blizzards instantly appeared in countless places in the Holy Region.

Heaven and Earth Phenomenon.

The Nine Dragon Thunder Tribulation was not over yet. The last strike of the accumulated power had directly triggered a phenomenon of heaven and earth.
