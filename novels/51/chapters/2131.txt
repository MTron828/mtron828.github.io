2132 The Ni Family’s Warship

Just as they were activating the Soul Chasing Chain, the chaos-origin Spiritual Energy Sword suddenly erupted. Under the impact of the Spiritual Energy Sword, the binding force of the chain completely shattered and was instantly torn apart by the chaos-origin Spiritual Energy Sword!

Under the impact of the Spiritual Energy Sword, the Soul Chasing Chain was instantly cut into numerous pieces, turning into streaks of blue light that scattered in the air.

Qin Yu took advantage of this opportunity to fully activate the magic power in his body, instantly breaking free from the shackles of the Soul Chasing Chain.

“Ha!” Qin Yu shouted in a low voice. The golden light under his feet instantly soared. His figure was like a meteor as he directly rushed into the sky.

“Impossible! “The linen-robed elderly man’s expression changed drastically. They could hardly believe what they were seeing. Their Soul Chasing Chain was actually broken by Qin Yu’s Chaos-origin Sword Technique. It was simply incredulous.

A mere Semi-Saint had actually broken their Soul Chasing Chain! This was simply unheard of!

They rushed toward Qin Yu, wanting to catch him again. However, Qin Yu’s speed became increasingly faster, practically disappearing from their sight instantly.

In the sky, Qin Yu’s figure sped past. His speed had already reached the limit, and in the blink of an eye, he disappeared into the distant horizon.

He flew in the direction of the day of the Path of Heaven.

“Qin Yu, you can’t escape!” a linen-robed elderly man said coldly.

As True Saints, their abilities were naturally not limited to this. They activated the Soul Chasing Chains again, and this time was even more terrifying than before!

Looking at Qin Yu’s back in the sky, a determined light flashed in the eyes of the linen-robed elderly men. Their hands swiftly drew complex runes in the air, and they chanted incantations to activate the Soul Chasing Chain again.

The afterimages of the Soul Chasing Chain in the sky instantly gathered as if time had reversed, and again they condensed into a complete Soul Chasing Chain. This time, the Soul Chasing Chain was sharper and more dazzling and emitted a terrifying power that could destroy everything.

“Soul chasing nine transformations, unrivaled soul lock.” The three linen-robed elderly men shouted in unison. Their voices were like thunder, echoing throughout the entire sky.

As their voices faded, the newly condensed Soul Chasing Chain instantly emitted an intense blue light that shot straight into the clouds as if penetrating the sky.

Simultaneously, the blue light on the Soul Chasing Chain formed complex array patterns in the air. These array patterns were like vivid blue dragons coming to life, circling and dancing in the air.

“Qin Yu, you have nowhere to run!” The linen-robed elderly men sneered. The Soul Chasing Chain in their hands suddenly vibrated violently in the air, and a powerful suction force instantly swept in all directions.

It was the unique feature of their Soul Chasing Chain. It could lock onto the soul of its target. No matter where the target escaped, it could not escape the lock of the Soul Chasing Chain.

Under the activation of the linen-robed elderly men, the Soul Chasing Chain instantly turned into a blue light, chasing after Qin Yu with lightning speed.

This time, the Soul Chasing Chain was even more ferocious and unstoppable than previously. Their speed was so fast that it had even surpassed the speed of sound. In an instant, they reached the back of Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, what are you running away from?” The voices of the linen-robed elderly men were like a judgment from the depths of the underworld, icy and chilling to the extreme.

However, just as the Soul Chasing Chain was about to touch Qin Yu, a golden light instantly erupted from his body.

Wherever the golden Spiritual Energy Sword passed, the air seemed to be torn apart. The golden light sped through the air and turned into a golden track, heading straight for the Soul Chasing Chain.

“Chaos-origin Energy, slash!” Qin Yu shouted, and the golden Spiritual Energy Sword instantly exploded with earth-shattering power. The Spiritual Energy Sword and the Soul Chasing Chain collided in the air.

The collision between the Spiritual Energy Sword and the chain was like the collision of two planets, instantly triggering an earth-shattering explosion. Endless light exploded in the air, creating a spectacular sight.

The three linen-robed elderly men snorted repeatedly. They raised their hands, and streams of dao technique mixed with Holy Power surged toward the Soul Chasing Chain!

In an instant, the Soul Chasing Chain became incomparably hard, and they emitted a tremendously terrifying radiance!

As the golden Spiritual Energy Sword and the blue Soul Chasing Chain collided, the Soul Chasing Chain was heaven-defying like a blue Divine Dragon, spiraling and dancing in the air. Although the golden Spiritual Energy Sword was powerful, it failed to completely tear the Soul Chasing Chain apart.

“Chaos-origin Energy, slash!” Seeing this, Qin Yu shouted again and activated the Chaos-origin Sword Technique to the extreme.

However, the Soul Chasing Chain seemed to have a life of its own. No matter how hard Qin Yu tried, he could not completely destroy it.

“Haha! Qin Yu, do you think you can escape from us?” The linen-robed elderly men sneered. The Soul Chasing Chain in their hands suddenly vibrated violently in the air, and a powerful suction force instantly swept in all directions. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Qin Yu felt his body tremble. His figure was instantly locked on, and he could not move. The blue Soul Chasing Chain was like a formidable gigantic snake with incredible life force, tightly entangling him, and he could not break free.

Qin Yu’s eyes flickered with an unyielding light. He muttered an incantation, and both hands drew complicated sword techniques in front of him.

However, that Soul Chasing Chain seemed to have a life of its own, tightly entangling Qin Yu, making him unable to move.

The linen-robed elderly men looked at Qin Yu, locked by the Soul Chasing Chain, and their faces revealed triumphant smiles. The Soul Chasing Chain in their hands was like a living gigantic snake, tightly coiling around Qin Yu’s body.

“Qin Yu, you now have nowhere to run!” The linen-robed elderly men sneered.

Although Qin Yu was locked onto by the Soul Chasing Chains, his eye expression was still firm, without the slightest trace of fear.

He slightly closed his eyes as if he still had some trump cards he had not unleashed.

The three looked at Qin Yu and said indifferently, “This is your last chance. Hand over the Traceless Immortal Scripture!”

However, Qin Yu did not say a word. No matter what they said, Qin Yu acted as if he did not hear anything and did not say a word.

Facing the provocation of the linen-robed elderly men, Qin Yu only glanced at them indifferently before turning his gaze into the distance.

The three of them were furious but could not do anything to Qin Yu.

“Bring him to the warship and hand him over to the First Elder,” a linen-robed elderly man said coldly.

The other two nodded and then sneered, “Qin Yu, it’s useless even if you don’t tell. When the time comes, we will use the Soul Searching Technique to search your divine sense by force.”

Qin Yu still did not say anything. He slightly closed his eyes as if he did not take these people seriously.

Therefore, the three did not say anything else. They brought Qin Yu and rushed toward the warship.

After a while, the three brought Qin Yu back to the warship.

The moment he stepped onto the warship, Qin Yu felt a tremendously ancient internal qi assaulting him.
