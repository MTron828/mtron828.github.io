Chapter 1262: Chapter 1,262, shattering the body 

Protector Ren’s expression changed drastically. He immediately threw away the silver spear and shot backwards.

The armor on his face had already been shattered, and the fragments had even pierced into his face.

Fresh blood flowed down his cheeks, adding a bright red to the pure silver color.

Qin Yu grabbed the silver spear, then suddenly exerted force in his hand and threw it at Protector Ren!

Qin Yu’s divine power was extremely terrifying. The power contained in this casual throw was almost enough to pierce through the sky!

Protector Ren knew this very well, so his hands were stained with streaks of divine light. He wanted to use this to dissolve Qin Yu’s divine power.

“Chi la!”

However, the moment he touched it, the radiance of Protector Ren’s palm was directly torn apart!

He had guessed that Qin Yu’s power was extremely terrifying, but he did not realize that this power was far beyond his imagination!

Protector Ren gritted his teeth. He gripped the silver spear tightly, allowing the distance between the spear and his palm to tear.

Fresh blood flowed down. The radiance, holy armor, and flesh on his hand were all torn apart, revealing white bones.

This was undoubtedly extremely embarrassing for Protector Ren.

As a protector of the Heavenly Cloud sect, he was well-known throughout the entire South Province. His status was extremely high, but today, he had undoubtedly lost all face.

Qin Yu looked coldly at guardian Ren and said, “I don’t want to be your enemy. The instigator of all this is elder Bai. I hope that your sect will be able to investigate.”

However, how could guardian Ren give him the chance? He said coldly, “My Tianyun sect never needs a reason to kill. If I let you die, you will die.”

“What a tyrannical sect.”Qin Yu laughed coldly.

Indeed, the world was as Black as crows. Compared to the mortal world, the holy region was even more cruel.

In this place, those without strength could only be reduced to fish meat at the mercy of others!

“If that’s the case, then let’s fight.”Qin Yu shouted coldly.

Protector Ren knew very well that he couldn’t get close to Qin Yu, so he was extremely vigilant.

He tried to use a spell, but when the spell hit Qin Yu’s body, it didn’t hurt him at all.

“What a tough body,”protector Ren thought to himself.

This body was no weaker than the top beasts in the green rock forest.

“Since I can’t kill you, I’ll capture you and bring you back to the sect,”protector Ren said coldly.

Then, he shouted, “Everyone, get into formation!”

After a loud roar, all the disciples stood in all directions.

Their bodies emitted an extremely strange radiance. Each of them seemed to have transformed into a magic artifact, fusing all the radiance together and covering Qin Yu within.

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu’s heart thumped, and his expression couldn’t help but change slightly.

If he was captured and brought back, then he would be in trouble.

Although Qin Yu’s physical body was invincible, it didn’t mean that the heavenly cloud sect didn’t have the ability to kill Qin Yu.

They could either wipe out Qin Yu’s divine sense or bind Qin Yu for a long time!

Soon, the Rays of light covered Qin Yu’s body and bound his limbs.

This force was so great that Qin Yu was almost unable to move.

However, after sensing this force, Qin Yu didn’t panic. Instead, he heaved a sigh of relief.

Fortunately, this spell was only used to bind the physical body, not divine sense.

As long as it was not a spell that targeted divine sense, Qin Yu was not afraid at all.

The silver spear in Protector Ren’s hand shook. The originally indestructible silver spear actually became soft at this moment. Like a small silver snake, it merged into the light.

In an instant, Qin Yu’s body was bound even tighter.

Qin Yu tried to struggle, but he found that this spell was extremely strange. It was clearly just a ray of light, but it brought a substantial sense of restraint.

Protector Ren looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Even if I can’t kill you, I can still bring you back to give you an explanation.”

Qin Yu didn’t say a word. His eyes narrowed slightly, and from the gaps of his eyes, an ice-cold light emitted.

This spell was indeed extremely strange. Qin Yu tried to struggle free, but he found that he couldn’t break free at all.

Protector Ren walked toward Qin Yu with big steps. He raised his huge palm and grabbed Qin Yu’s head.

However, at this moment, Qin Yu suddenly reached out and grabbed protector Ren’s wrist.

Protector Ren’s expression changed and he felt as if his back was being stabbed!

“Not good, he broke free from this spell!”Protector Ren shouted.

There was no other reason other than Qin Yu had used the battle word formula.

Although it was only the first level, he still easily broke free from this power.

“Bang!”

Before Protector Ren could escape, Qin Yu had already thrown a punch at his chest.

The first punch directly shattered the silver sacred armor that covered his body!

The second punch shattered the flesh and bones on his body.

The third punch caused Protector Ren to spit out blood continuously and his internal Qi became dispirited.

However, this protector Ren was a mighty realm expert with rich battle experience after all. It was naturally not so easy to kill him.

Seeing that things were not looking good, he quickly released his primordial spirit and decisively abandoned his physical body and fled.

That illusory primordial spirit turned into a stream of light and disappeared without a trace in the blink of an eye. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Protector Ren’s body fiercely fell down, shaking the ground and stirring up smoke and dust.

The surrounding disciples could not help but change their expressions.

They also did not expect protector Ren to be so decisive.

Although he could survive without his physical body, it would not be so easy to recover in a short period of time.

Most importantly, his physical body was already dead. Who knew how many people saw this scene.

If it was spread out, it would not only embarrass guardian Ren, but the entire heavenly cloud sect.

“Retreat.”

Seeing that the situation was not good, these disciples hurriedly left.

Qin Yu did not chase after them because the Tianyun sect was extremely powerful. No one could guarantee that they would not send reinforcements.

Thus, Qin Yu smashed the array formation in the mansion with one punch and then fled.

On the other side, Protector Ren fled back to the Tianyun sect in an extremely sorry state and chose to enter closed-door cultivation that day.

And this matter naturally spread very quickly.

The Tianyun sect, which had not suffered a setback for many years, not only had a few disciples been killed in public, but they had also repelled a protector. For a time, it was unknown how many people’s attention had been attracted.

“That person called Qin Yu seems to have just been extradited by the Heavenly Cloud Sect.”

“That’s right. He has just arrived and has already shown his might to the heavenly cloud sect. I’m afraid this Qin Yu is not simple.”

“Rumor has it that he can not cultivate and can only rely on his physical body. That’s why he was chased out by the Heavenly Cloud sect. As a result, they have formed an enmity with him.”

“It’s useless. He has offended the heavenly cloud sect in the southern province. I’m afraid he has no place to stand.”
