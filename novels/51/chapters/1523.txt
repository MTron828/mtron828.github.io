Chapter 1524: Chapter 1,524. The shocked Sima Bei 1

In the Fallen Life Valley, Qin Yu tried his best to resist.

He almost formed a balance with the heavenly tribulation. His entire body was drenched in blood and sweat, but it was instantly evaporated.

Even though Qin Yu had already pushed himself to his limit, the heavenly tribulation was still too powerful. In the end, Qin Yu was exhausted and was ruthlessly slammed to the ground by the heavenly tribulation.

After a loud bang, half of Qin Yu’s body was smashed into the soil.

The blood and the soil mixed with the sound of thunder and lightning.

This place had completely turned into scorched soil, and a pungent smell assaulted his nose.

“Not good!”Seeing this, Zhuo Jing’s face couldn’t help but change!

Li Yingying, who was beside him, was overjoyed!

So what if you are a genius? You still died under the heavenly tribulation in the end. This is the price you pay for rejecting me!

“Eh? Qin Yu’s internal Qi doesn’t seem to have weakened.”At this moment, Zhuo Jing suddenly exclaimed.

After hearing these words, Li Yingying also hurriedly stretched out a strand of divine sense.

As expected, although Qin Yu looked extremely miserable, his internal Qi was still extremely vigorous. There was no time for him to be dispirited!

“It seems that Qin Yu’s resistance has reduced most of the power of the Heavenly Tribulation!”Zhuo Jing said with some excitement.

......

This time, Li Yingying couldn’t sit still.

If this continued, Qin Yu might really succeed in surviving the heavenly tribulation!

The impatient Li Yingying suddenly had a thought.

She looked at Zhuo Jing and said, “Brother Zhuo, this Qin Yu’s talent is so terrifying. When he grows up in the future, he will definitely threaten you and me!”

Zhuo Jing’s face darkened and he said coldly, “What do you mean by that?”

Li Yingying also decided to cut all pretenses. She looked in the direction of Qin Yu and said coldly, “If such a person is alive, he will definitely snatch away our glory. It’s better for us to get rid of him now!”

Zhuo Jing’s eyes narrowed slightly.

He sized up Li Yingying and said with a cold tone, “Li Yingying, do you know what you are talking about?”

“Of course I know! Brother Zhuo, think about it carefully. Don’t you want to go to the Zhong Province? If Qin Yu goes with you, who in the Zhong province will look up to us?”Li Yingying said earnestly.

“As long as you kill Qin Yu, you will still be the most outstanding young talent in the South Province! When that time comes...”

“Shut up!”Zhuo Jing shouted and interrupted Li Yingying’s words.

He looked at Li Yingying coldly and said, “The glory of others will never stop you from Shining.”

“Li Yingying, I thought you were just a little more careful. I didn’t expect you to be so vicious!”

Li Yingying’s face changed and she hurriedly said, “Brother Zhuo, i...”

“Don’t Call Me Brother Zhuo. I’m asking you to leave immediately before I completely hate you,”Zhuo Jing said coldly.

Li Yingying still wanted to say something, but the Silver Spring in Zhuo Jing’s hand had already been unsheathed.

Feeling the icy coldness, Li Yingying suddenly felt extremely wronged.

“Why are you targeting me!”Li Yingying stomped her feet and said.

Zhuo Jing said coldly, “Targeting you? Before saying that others are targeting you, think carefully about what you have done. Get lost!”

Li Yingying gritted her teeth. Although she was a little flustered and exasperated, there was nothing she could do about Zhuo Jing. She could only leave this place for the time being.

Qin Yu, who was lying on the ground, heard their conversation clearly.

The corner of his mouth could not help but reveal a smile as he said in a low voice, “It seems that... I didn’t misjudge the person...”

Not only did Qin Yu hear their conversation, even Sima Bei, who was hiding in the dark, heard it clearly.

“This Li Yingying is really jealous,”said the black-robed man.

Sima bei sneered, “Jealousy is an extremely terrifying thing. Of course, this kind of person is also the easiest to use.”

Then, Sima Bei looked at the black-robed man and said, “Bring her to the northern lands.”

“Ah?”The black-robed man was stunned.

Sima bei said indifferently, “I have my own uses.”

“Yes!”The black-robed man hurriedly nodded.

Following that, he secretly followed behind Li Yingying.

In the Fallen Life Valley, Qin Yu struggled to get up from the ground.

He shook off the dust on his body and kept stuffing the pill into his mouth.

After a few pills entered his stomach, Qin Yu immediately looked much more energetic.

“Damn, this heavenly tribulation is much more terrifying than I imagined.”Qin Yu sighed.

He tried to sense his body. With his current state, it would be very difficult for him to withstand the next few rounds of the Heavenly Tribulation.

In the sky, the heavenly tribulation was still rolling. This time, the power was even more terrifying.

At this moment, Qin Yu had no choice but to use his treasures.

The Huangji Buddhist flame, the iron rod, and even the divine picture might have to be used.

“Rumble...”

The heavenly tribulation was still brewing. Qin Yu raised his head and stared at the heavenly tribulation. He was calculating something in his heart.

“There are still six rounds of Heavenly Tribulation.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

He didn’t dare to guarantee that the treasure in his hand would be able to withstand the heavenly tribulation.

“I wonder if the venerable fifth mountain will be able to do it.”At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of his earliest magical artifact.

Although this magical artifact looked extremely ordinary, it had saved Qin Yu’s life every time at the critical moment.

“Whether it will work or not, let’s try it first.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

As he spoke, another mouthful of blood gushed out of Qin Yu’s mouth.

It was very obvious that Qin Yu was already heavily injured. If it wasn’t for his tenacious willpower, the pain in his body alone would have been enough to kill Qin Yu here.

Rumble..

The heavenly tribulation rolled as if it was going to descend at any moment. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qin Yu adjusted his internal Qi and prepared for the fourth heavenly tribulation.

Boom

Before Qin Yu could make any preparations, the fourth heavenly tribulation suddenly arrived!

This time, the heavenly tribulation was like a lightning snake that was spitting out its tongue. It was approaching Qin Yu at an extremely fast speed!

Such speed caused Qin Yu to turn pale with fright!

He didn’t dare to think too much and quickly summoned the venerable fifth mountain to meet it!

The moment the venerable fifth mountain appeared, it grew in size at an extremely fast speed and appeared in front of Qin Yu to meet the Heavenly Tribulation!

At this moment, the mountain was flickering with an extremely mysterious and ancient aura, as if it was activated by internal Qi!

The huge mountain blotted out the sky and covered the Sun. It was actually on par with the lightning!

“As expected, the venerable fifth mountain definitely has a magical use!”Qin Yu was instantly overjoyed!

He had long suspected that he had not developed the venerable fifth mountain enough. Now, he firmly believed in this idea!

Just as Qin Yu was overjoyed, he suddenly felt a mysterious aura approaching him. It was the internal Qi of the venerable fifth mountain.

However, at this moment, Qin Yu had no time to care about anything else. The slightest carelessness could turn him into ashes!

“As expected of someone who gives even the heavenly cloud sect a headache. He really has some ability.”A voice entered Qin Yu’s ears.

This voice was extremely familiar, and Qin Yu quickly thought of a person!

The northern lands, Sima Bei!

“You... Who Are You?”Zhuo Jing looked at this person warily.
