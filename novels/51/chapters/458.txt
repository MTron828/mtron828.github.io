Chapter 459: Strength Increased Explosively! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

If Qin Yu still didn’t return the next day, he might have to consider temporarily withdrawing from Chuzhou.

He Teng came so aggressively that no one could stop him. Defending at this time was meaningless.

However, the next day, He Teng sent out another piece of news.

He said publicly, “As long as you are willing to bow down to me, He Teng, you will be able to survive. This will be your last chance.”

As soon as this news was sent out, countless people immediately stood on He Teng’s side!

He Teng specially held a cocktail party for Qin Yu’s old subordinates.

On the same day, countless people who had ties with Qin Yu came to this cocktail party to express their loyalty.

At noon, nearly fifty people came to this cocktail party.

He Teng looked at everyone and said indifferently, “A wise person chooses a good boss. You are all smart people.”

The crowd raised their wine glasses and flattered, “Mr. He is unparalleled in the world. It is our honor to be able to follow you!”

“That’s right. You are already a half-step Martial Marquis at such a young age, and you are also the number one person in the Central Plains. How can Qin Yu be compared to you?!”

In the face of the crowd’s flattery, He Teng remained silent.

He glanced at them and said indifferently, “I don’t think Jiang Gu is here,.”

As soon as he said that, the crowd fell into a short silence.

Almost everyone knew that Jiang Gu was Qin Yu’s trusted aide, and he was a big shot in Chuzhou!

“Jiang Gu indeed didn’t come,” someone said.

“This person is Qin Yu’s lackey. It’s better to kill him directly.”

He Teng snorted coldly and continued, “Where’s Gu Taichu? He didn’t come either?” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Everyone couldn’t help but gasp at the mention of this name.

Compared to Jiang Gu, Gu Taichu was even more famous! Moreover, his influence spread throughout the entire Central Plains!

“Master Gu... perhaps he didn’t receive any news,” someone whispered.

He Teng was somewhat displeased.

In his eyes, Jiang Gu and Gu Taichu were more important than everyone present combined!

However, only these two didn’t show up!

“Go tell Jiang Gu and Gu Taichu that I’ll only give them one hour,” He Teng said coldly with his hands behind his back.

“If they don’t show up in one hour, I’ll show no mercy!”

Everyone present quickly picked up their phones and called Jiang Gu and Gu Taichu.

Jiang Gu had a solemn look on his face when he received the call.

“He Teng is forcing us to make a choice,” Jiang Gu said in a deep voice.

Uncle Zhong whispered, “How about... We temporarily give in to He Teng. In any case, Qin Yu won’t come back at all.”

Jiang Gu frowned and shook his head. “No. If I add insult to injury, I’m afraid I’ll be hated for the rest of my life.”

“Qin Yu abandoned us and ran away. How can he still have the nerve to hate us?” Uncle Zhong said with extreme displeasure.

Jiang Gu glanced at him and said in a deep voice, “Mr. Qin might not know anything about what is happening in Chuzhou.”

...

Gu Taichu also received the call.

His attitude was much clearer than Jiang Gu’s.

Gu Taichu said on the phone, “Please tell He Teng that I have to see if he is worthy enough for me to submit to him.”

After saying this, Gu Taichu hung up the phone.

These words infuriated He Teng!

At the banquet, a terrifying murderous aura immediately burst out!

“How shameless!” He Teng said coldly.

“They really are two loyal dogs. I want to see what Qin Yu can do for you guys!”

After saying that, He Teng slammed the door and left.

At this moment, Yao Qing was sitting at home and waiting anxiously.

“He Teng is holding a banquet today, and we didn’t go. He must be very angry,” Yao Qing said while stroking his chin.

He stared at his phone and muttered, “If I’m not mistaken, he will call us and force us to make a choice.”

Taozi also nodded slightly and said, “That’s right. As the people closest to Elder Qin, He Teng’s first target must be us!”

However, time passed by minute by minute, and in the blink of an eye, it was evening.

The banquet had long ended, but Yao Qing and Taozi still didn’t receive a call.

“F * ck!” Finally, Yao Qing couldn’t hold it in anymore.

“He Teng actually didn’t even pay attention to us!”

Taozi rolled her eyes and said, “This is a good thing. At least we don’t have to face escape.”

Yao Qing muttered, “That being said, He Teng is looking down on us...”

“Alright. If you really are a big shot, can you still be standing here?” Taozi rolled her eyes.

Even though that was the case, Yao Qing was still a little unhappy deep down.

...

Inside the Water Rhyme Tower, Qin Yu’s body was burning with internal qi.

At a glance, his body seemed to be wrapped up by streams of white qi.

It wasn’t that the entire Water Rhyme Tower’s spiritual energy wouldn’t be depleted. It was just that the amount of spiritual energy stored in it was too large, so it didn’t seem to have been used up much.

But what was surprising was that ever since Qin Yu entered the Water Rhyme Tower, the spiritual energy in it had been greatly reduced.

After a few days, the spiritual energy had almost reached a state of loss!

That night, Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes.

A powerful internal qi rampaged through his body.

The terrifying power even made his body swell!

Light gradually gathered on his skin like an armor that fitted perfectly with Qin Yu.

“In just a few days, I have reached the peak of the Enlightenment Stage,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He tried to take another step forward, but found that there was no more spiritual energy around him to absorb.

“The spiritual energy here is so dense, but it was completely absorbed by me?” Qin Yu scratched his head while looking a little embarrassed.

If He Teng found out about this, he would probably die of anger!

He had been cultivating in the Water Rhyme Tower for several years, but the spiritual energy storage had hardly been reduced.

However, in just a few days, Qin Yu had completely absorbed all the spiritual energy!

“It seems that I have to find some herbs and step into the half-step Martial Marquis realm as soon as possible,” Qin Yu clenched his fist and said in a low voice.

From the early-stage of the Enlightenment Stage to the peak of the Enlightenment Stage, the difference in strength was beyond imagination.

And the higher the cultivation realm, the greater the space for the increase in strength.

Compared to the early-stage of the Enlightenment Stage, Qin Yu’s strength had increased by at least a hundred times!

“With my current strength, I shouldn’t need to use so much effort to fight against Meng Wuxiong,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

“As for He Teng... he shouldn’t be a threat either!”
