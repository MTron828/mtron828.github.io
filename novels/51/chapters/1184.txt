Chapter 1185: Chapter 1,185, the quota for the holy region 

Looking at Lu Guan who was like a dead dog, everyone was stunned.

“Could it be that there’s a riot in the Holy Mausoleum? !”Someone guessed.

“After all, it’s the Holy Mausoleum, so it must be filled with danger. The sect master and the others wouldn’t...”someone’s expression changed drastically!

As they were speaking, Qin Yu and Chang Mang had already walked out of the Holy Mausoleum.

Looking at the white-haired Qin Yu, Fang Yue couldn’t help but frown slightly.

“This is...”she stretched out her hand and stroked Qin Yu’s long white hair.

Qin Yu glanced at her and said, “I’ll explain it to you in the future.”

Fang Yue was an extremely intelligent person, and she also had the ability to read the hearts of others.

Even though this move was useless in front of Qin Yu, she still guessed something.

Therefore, Fang Yue said with a smile, “You look more handsome this way.”

Qin Yu was stunned, and then he couldn’t help but smile bitterly.

“Stop joking.”A trace of bitterness flashed across Qin Yu’s face.

“What I said is true. This way, you look more like the number one person in the world.”Fang Yue covered her mouth and laughed lightly.

It had to be said that Fang Yue’s words did bring a trace of comfort to Qin Yu.

He waved his hand and said, “Alright, let’s return to the Heaven Gate for now.”

On the way back with everyone.

Many disciples stared at Qin Yu and whispered among themselves.

“Sect master seems to have aged a lot.”

“Yeah, even his face has wrinkles...”

“It seems that the holy mausoleum is full of dangers. Look at Lu Guan from the Holy Region, he has become a dead dog.”

Qin Yu did not take the discussion to heart. Since it had already happened, there was no need to worry about it anymore.

After returning to the Heaven Gate, Qin Yu came to the mirror.

He looked at his old self in the mirror and felt a little sad.

His black hair turned white. It was an indescribable blow to anyone.

The only consolation was that Qin Yu’s physical strength did not change much.

Not only did the twilight Qi not weaken Qin Yu’s physical body, it even made him stronger.

He lightly clenched his fist. He could feel the powerful strength brought by his physical body, but he still did not have the support of spirit energy.

This made Qin Yu feel that something was wrong.

Normally, when spirit energy disappeared, it would be slowly replenished later. Using herbs and other things, it would recover faster.

However, it had already been so long, and Qin Yu still could not feel any spiritual energy in his body.

“Could it be that there is still some twilight energy left in my body?”Qin Yu thought to himself.

After thinking about it, it seemed that this was the only possibility.

At this moment, Lu Yun and Chang Mang pushed the door open and entered.

Qin Yu glanced at Lu Yun, and then ignored him. Instead, his gaze fell on Chang Mang.

“What’s Wrong?”Qin Yu asked.

Chang Mang walked to Qin Yu’s side and sat down. Then, he pointed at Lu Yun and said, “She has something to ask you.”

Lu Yun frowned slightly and said, “We came here with a mission, which is to explore this ancient star.”

“Right now, our first target is the Qingdi Park, but we can’t enter it now. So I want to know what’s inside.”

Qin Yu sneered, “If you want to know, go in and take a look yourself.”

Lu Yun glanced at Qin Yu’s white hair. He didn’t say anything, but his meaning was very obvious.

“Forget it, I’ll tell you. There’s a bronze coffin and a corpse inside,”Qin Yu waved her hand and said.

“But the twilight qi inside is extremely dense and full of holy power. It’s already not easy to walk to the bronze coffin, and it’s almost impossible to take it out.”

Lu Yun heard this and a trace of regret flashed across his face.

She stood there and didn’t say anything for a long time.

“Why? Is there anything else?”Qin Yu asked.

Lu Yun came back to his senses and then said, “The second thing is the matter of extradition to the Holy Region.”

This aroused Qin Yu’s interest.

He quickly said, “Okay. Aren’t you guys going to have a public selection? It’ll be at my Heaven Gate, but you have to give me a fixed quota.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Lu Yun agreed and said, “Of course, no problem. You can draw up the list.”

Qin Yu rubbed his chin and expressed his thoughts.

However, Qin Yu’s thoughts caused Lu Yun to turn pale with fright.

The reason was none other than Qin Yu wanted to bring all the people of the Heaven Gate to the Holy Region!

Without a doubt, Lu Yun refused on the spot.

“Going to the holy region is not something we can control. Only ancient sages have the ability to cross the galaxy,”Lu Yun explained.

“With our cultivation, we can only rely on the ancient array platform. Furthermore, to activate the ancient array platform, we need an extradition flag. The extradition flag in our hands can only take away thirty people at most.”

Hearing those words, Qin Yu could not help but frown.

Thirty people? If that was the case, it would be impossible to extradite them on a large scale.

“That’s simple. After we go to the sanctum of sages, we can get more extradition flags and take it slow,”Chang Mang said from the side.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and sighed, “That’s all we can do.”

After thinking about it, Qin Yu decided to draw up a list in advance.

Everyone had their own selfish motives, and Qin Yu was no exception.

Like Chang Mang and the others, Qin Yu had to send them to the Holy Region first.

“You go back first. I’ll give you the list tomorrow morning,”Qin Yu said to Lu Yun.

Lu Yun grunted in gratitude and then agreed.

That night, Qin Yu took out a pen and paper and began to plan the names.

Chang Mang, Yao Qing, Jiang he, pavilion master, Fang Yue, xianhe, and the others were naturally the first. They could be said to be Qin Yu’s closest relatives.

As for Jiang Gu and Gu Taichu, they were naturally in Qin Yu’s plan. It was just that their strength was low, so whether they were willing to go or not was still a problem.

Qin Yu took out his phone and called Jiang Gu and Gu Taichu respectively.

And these two people’s answers were surprisingly the same: they didn’t want to go to the holy region, they only wanted to stay on Earth, dominate a region, and live a stable life.

Next were Yi Yao Meng, Kong Yun, Zhuang Teng, Xiao Yuan, Chu Hedao, Chu Heng, and the others.

In total, including Qin Yu, they had already taken up thirteen spots.

Together with Yu Qin, Taozi, and the others whom Qin Yu owed a favor to, they had nearly twenty people.

“Thirty spots... is still too little.”Qin Yu could not help but frown.

However, according to Tian Jizi, Lu Yun was definitely not the only sect from the holy region. They still had a chance in the future.
