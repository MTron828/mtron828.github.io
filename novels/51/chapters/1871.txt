1872 Iron Egg’s Meritorious Service

Even so, Qin Yu was still extremely worried.

As time passed, the battle in the Tong family’s direction became more and more intense. All kinds of lights filled the sky, and the entire sky was reflected in a myriad of colors.

And that terrifying aura kept rippling over, like a lake that had been thrown into a stone. The water-like aura kept surging toward everyone.

Qin Yu stared in the direction of the Tong family, feeling more and more nervous.

Although it had only been a dozen minutes, Qin Yu couldn’t wait any longer.

“You guys wait for me here, I’ll go take a look and be right back,” he said as he hurriedly got up.

“You just sit here, I’ll go.” Chang Mang waved his hand and stopped Qin Yu.

With that, Chang Mang stood up and was about to head to the Tong family.

However, at this moment, an aura rushed toward Qin Yu and the others.

This aura was extremely powerful and familiar.

Everyone was nervous. They stood up and prepared for battle.

However, Qin Yu only heaved a sigh of relief when the man approached him.

The newcomer was none other than Iron Egg.

At this moment, his body was covered in wounds. Half of his body had been shattered, and large amounts of blood were flowing out. This showed the difficulty of this battle.

“Qin Yu,” he cursed as he walked, “You owe me a favor! You owe me a favor!

Qin Yu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. This guy, Iron Egg, seemed to place a lot of importance on this.

“It’s good that you’re still alive,” he said, quickly getting up. “I’ll remember that I owe you a favor.”

Iron Egg was a little reluctant. He threw the magic ruler back to Qin Yu and muttered, “Damn it, I almost died.”

“How’s the Tong family now?” Qin Yu tried to ask.

“I killed that old man.” Iron Egg said proudly.

“As for the rest, I won’t bother with it.” Iron Egg waved his hand, looking weak.

Qin Yu was overjoyed. He nodded and said, “Alright, alright, alright. Thank you. I’ll just take it that you saved my life.”

“I did save your life! You better f*cking remember this!” Iron Egg said, his eyes wide.

He was already severely injured. In his anger, he spat out even more blood like a fountain.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to provoke him anymore, so he bowed and thanked him.

Qin Yu had planned to make a few pills for Iron Egg before letting him go, but Iron Egg was stubborn and didn’t want to stay at all. He turned around and disappeared without a trace.

After Iron Egg left, Chang Mang couldn’t help but frown, “Is that guy really alright? It looks like he’s quite seriously injured…”

“He should be fine.” Qin Yu waved her hand.

Although Qin Yu couldn’t figure out Iron Egg’s strength, he must be extremely powerful since he could kill the old man in the Semi-Saint realm.

So, Qin Yu glanced at the crowd and said in a deep voice, “Alright, it’s time for us to go on stage.”

The group of them rushed back to the Tong family’s house again!

When they arrived at the Tong residence, it had already become a ruin and looked extremely miserable.

What surprised Qin Yu was that all of Tong Lianyang’s limbs had been broken. He was now like a human puppet, squatting there.

Without a doubt, this was the work of Iron Egg.

Qin Yu walked forward and stood in front of Tong Lianyang.

“Tong Lianyang, what other resources does your Tong family have? Take them out.” Qin Yu said coldly.

Tong Lianyang raised his head and looked at Qin Yu, then said with some emotion, “I really didn’t expect that the Tong family would actually be buried in my hands…”

Chang Mang consoled him, “Aiya, it’s fine. Nothing in this world is permanent. Don’t worry and go.”

Although he was comforting him, his words almost made Tong Lianyang vomit blood.

He glared at Qin Yu and said through clenched teeth, “Little bastard, my Tong family will never let you off!”

“The Tong family is gone. What can you use to fight me?” Qin Yu sneered.

At this moment, Tong Lianyang suddenly shouted. An extremely terrifying power emerged from his body!

This force directly pushed Qin Yu, Chang Mang, and the others back a few meters. At a glance, his body was constantly emitting light, and his aura was getting stronger!

Qin Yu frowned and said, “This old man… Don’t tell me he’s going to self-destruct!”

“Something’s wrong!” Jiu Xiao shook his head and said, “He seems to be using some secret technique.”

The moment these words were said, everyone became nervous.

In their current state, if the Tong family still had some hidden power, they would definitely not have the slightest power to resist!

“Boom!”

Right at this moment, the void in front of Tong Lianyang exploded!

A seven-colored light gushed out of the void, which was extremely dazzling!

“Guangqing, hurry up and leave!”

Tong Lianyang shouted. He used all his strength to open up a wormhole and used the last of his strength to send Tong Guangqing out!

“Father!”

Tong Guangqing, who had been thrown into the void, shouted with all his might. His tears fell into the void, but he had no power to stop it all. He could only watch himself go further and further away.

...

Tong Lianyang used the last breath of his life to send Tong Guangqing out of the Tong residence.

After doing all this, Tong Guangqing also passed away on the spot, without any breath to speak of.

When the crowd saw such a tragic scene, they sighed with emotion.

It was a pity that all parents in the world had the same heart.

Tong Guangqing would never have thought that his father loved him so deeply. It was a pity that he would never have the chance to see his father again.

The surroundings were desolate. After a great battle, what welcomed them was often boundless coldness.

But at this moment, Qin Yu didn’t have the time to think about that. He released his spiritual awareness and quickly found Jue Wu’s figure.

After that, Qin Yu didn’t dare to waste any more time. He hurriedly shot in Jue Wu’s direction, with Chang Mang following closely behind.

They arrived at the dungeon.

In the dungeon, Jue Wu’s four limbs had been broken, and her body was bound by all kinds of chains.

And these chains had a secret technique that made Jue Wu’s body unable to regenerate.

...

Seeing Jue Wu’s miserable state, Qin Yu’s heart ached.

He hurriedly walked forward and broke the chains with one palm.

“Jue Wu… Are you alright?” Qin Yu frowned, trying to suppress the guilt and heartache in her heart.

Jue Wu waved her hand and said, “I don’t have a problem. But you, kid, you really got me out of here. You’ve really grown up. I’m very pleased.”

Seeing that Jue Wu was still in the mood to joke, Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh.

He held Jue Wu in his arms and said, “Alright, I’ll take you back now.”

Then, they walked out of the dungeon together. As for the other people of Demon-slaying Peak, they were naturally responsible for cleaning up the battlefield and sweeping away the Tong family’s secret treasures.

Of course, Qin Yu was not involved.

The brothers of Demon-slaying Peak had come to help, so they should get some benefits. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

After they had cleaned up the place, everyone took the formation and left the place.
