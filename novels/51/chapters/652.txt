Chapter 653: Martial Saint Weapon! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The huge figure’s fist continued to smash towards the ground. The entire ground had already collapsed, but it didn’t show any intention of stopping!

Everyone couldn’t help but gasp!

With such strength, even steel would have been flattened.

Everyone looked at this bloody scene, and a trace of solemnity appeared on their faces.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The sound of the punches was like thunder exploding in the sky.

The ground had already collapsed by a few meters, and the Martial Arts Academy had been reduced to ruins!

Just when everyone thought that Qin Yu had been crushed, a golden light suddenly burst out from the pit!

The golden light exploded like a bomb. Then, a golden fist stretched out from the huge pit to meet the huge fist of the figure!

The huge fist stopped sinking! It even kept retreating!

“Ah!!!”

An angry roar came from the huge pit!

Then, a huge golden giant crawled out from the huge pit!

It was Qin Yu! At this moment, he was extremely huge, and the golden light was dazzling!

“Cosmic form!” Qu Xie’s expression quickly turned ugly when he saw this technique!

Qin Yu crawled out of the huge pit. His huge body gave off a strong pressure!

“F * ck you!” Qin Yu was furious. He clenched his fist and smashed it at the Ten Thousand Demonic Statues!

The two giants began to fight at this moment!

Qin Yu’s body was stained with blood, but his internal qi didn’t decrease at all!

The more he fought, the braver he became. His fierce fist forced the Ten Thousand Demonic Statues to retreat!

“Go to hell!”

Following Qin Yu’s furious roar, the blue veins on his arm bulged. His huge golden fist ruthlessly smashed onto the face of the Ten Thousand Demonic Statues!

“Boom!”

The strength of this punch was terrifying. The Ten Thousand Demonic Statues actually fell to the ground!

The scene stirred up waves of dust, causing the ground to sink even more!

Qin Yu seemed to have gone mad. His eyes looked menacing and he wanted to give them a taste of their own medicine!

His golden fist continuously smashed towards the Ten Thousand Demonic Statues!

One punch, two punches, three punches!

The huge figure looked extremely shocked. Even the young masters of the various aristocratic families couldn’t help but feel shocked!

“Ah!!!”

Qin Yu seemed to have gone mad. He grabbed the arm of the Ten Thousand Demonic Statues with a furious roar!

Then, Qin Yu swung his fierce fist and smashed it on his head.

Qin Yu punched countless times until the golden light on Qin Yu’s body started to dissipate!

The head of the Ten Thousand Demonic Statues seemed to be about to explode, and the black-gold robe powerhouse that was controlling the Ten Thousand Demonic Statues was vomiting blood non-stop, as if he couldn’t take it anymore!

“This kid must die!” Qu Xie was extremely furious!

The strength that Qin Yu had displayed today had already begun to scare him!

If he was allowed to continue growing, he would definitely become a formidable enemy of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association in the future!

“Boom!”

Another punch landed, and finally, the Ten Thousand Demonic Statues couldn’t take it anymore.

His huge head shattered, and then his body began to disintegrate!

“Phew!”

Several black-gold robe powerhouses were immediately shaken until they vomited blood, and their internal qi became dispirited!

“The Ten Thousand Demonic Statues... lost!” Yan Jinyao couldn’t help but clench his teeth!

He had seen the Ten Thousand Demonic Statues before. That was a holy spell, and its power was unimaginable!

But now, it was actually defeated byf Qin Yu. How could he endure this?!

Qin Yu’s cosmic form still didn’t disintegrate. He looked at Qu Xie with cold eyes.

“Qu Xie, I’m coming to take your life!” Qin Yu shouted!

Then, Qin Yu took a step forward and punched at Qu Xie with his golden fist!

Qu Xie said coldly, “You don’t know your place. Today is the day you die!”

Qu Xie took out a long ruler. The moment he took it out, an extremely terrifying force spread out!

“Prajna ruler! A Martial Saint Weapon!” Someone recognized this magic artifact!

As Qu Xie activated the Prajna ruler, a terrifying force instantly smashed toward Qin Yu!

“Boom!”

The moment it touched Qin Yu’s body, his body was sent flying, and his fist was dripping with blood!

This was the terrifying aspect of a Martial Saint Weapon! Even the cosmic form couldn’t be compared to it!

“Today is the day you die!” Qu Xie said coldly.

Then, he activated the Prajna ruler again and charged at Qin Yu!

Qin Yu raised his head and roared furiously. He activated all the power in his body and charged forward again! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

However, the Martial Saint Weapon couldn’t be resisted. Qin Yu’s power wasn’t even worth mentioning in front of the Prajna ruler!

His body was sent flying and was almost shattered! His internal qi also quickly withered!

“This is the frightening aspect of the Martial Saint Weapon,” Yao Meng said in a deep voice.

“Unless one has become a Martial Saint, no one can fight against the Martial Saint Weapon.”

Qin Yu’s expression was also extremely ugly. Just two light collisions had caused Qin Yu to be heavily injured!

All of his spells were nothing in front of the Martial Saint Weapon!

The cosmic form also began to disappear, and Qin Yu returned to his normal state.

He struggled to get up from the ground. He knew little about the Martial Saint Weapon, and a trace of fear emerged in his heart.

“This won’t do. I’m afraid I won’t be able to withstand the third attack.” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He forcefully adjusted his state, then he used the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch techqniue and rushed towards the round altar!

At the instant he rushed over, Qin Yu took out his bronze sword!

Then, Qin Yu held the sword with both hands and fiercely slashed toward the tube attached to Yan Ruoxue’s body!

Since he couldn’t defeat this Martial Saint Weapon, then he would think of a way to escape with Yan Ruoxue!

“Hmph, do you think you can save her?!” Qu Xie sneered.

He once again activated the Martial Saint Weapon and smashed it towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. He hurriedly summoned the Venerable Fifth Mountain to meet the attack!

“Clang!”

This attack made the Venerable Fifth Mountain hum and tremble. In the next second, it was sent flying!

“Oh no!” Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically when he saw this!

This was the first time the Venerable Fifth Mountain had lost its effect! The power of the Martial Saint Weapon was far beyond Qin Yu’s imagination!

“Qin Yu, I’ve let you live for so long. Today will be the day of your death,” Qu Xie said coldly.

The Prajna ruler in his hand flickered with light, as if it was brewing an extremely strong killing intent!

Waves of terrifying internal qi spread out. Just the internal qi alone was enough to make everyone vomit blood!

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely unsightly. Under this attack, he would die without a doubt!

“Go to hell!”

Qu Xie roared furiously, and his Prajna ruler shook. A terrifying power instantly pressed toward Qin Yu!

“This is the only way!” Qin Yu gritted his teeth and roared furiously. He immediately took out the two male corpses from his Spatial Magic Artifact!
