Chapter 978: Chapter 978, the fourth slash of the nine absolute beginning slashes!

Ever since he was modified by Luo Jingyu, Qin Yu had never used the bronze sword!

Qin Yu, who had always relied on his physical body, had long forgotten about the bronze sword!

“Yes, the bronze sword!”Qin Yu’s eyes lit up. With a shake of his palm, a longsword fell into his hand.

The Longsword was scarlet in color, and traces of killing intent emanated from it!

“Phew, thanks.”Qin Yu waved his hand in the direction of the handlebar mustache.

The handlebar mustache hurriedly hid his head in the crowd, afraid of being discovered.

Qin Yu held the bronze sword and looked coldly at the white bones in front of him.

“HMPH, do you think you can fight against a mighty figure with a broken sword?”Tian Xuehong’s eyes were filled with ridicule.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He held the sword with both hands and narrowed his eyes, looking somewhat nervous.

Facing this almighty body, even if he was holding the bronze sword, Qin Yu still felt a little uncertain.

“Whoosh!”

At this moment, the white bones had already rushed towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu didn’t dare to be negligent. He immediately held the sword and slashed out fiercely!

“Clang!”

At the instant of the collision, Sparks immediately flew in all directions.

That terrifying force shook Qin Yu’s wrist until it hurt. The bronze sword in his hand almost fell down.

“F * ck, it’s useless...”Qin Yu couldn’t help but widen his eyes when he saw this!

The body of this skeleton was really beyond his imagination!

Before Qin Yu could react, the skeleton had already rushed towards Qin Yu again!

His hands turned into claws and clawed straight at Qin Yu’s head!

Qin Yu hurriedly placed the sword horizontally above his head to block this attack.

“Clang!”

There was another loud sound. This time, Qin Yu couldn’t hold it anymore. The sword in his hand flew out.

“Hahahaha!”

Seeing this scene, Tian Xuehong couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“Is that all you have?”Tian Xuehong raised his eyebrows and said.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He rushed to the side of the bronze sword and pulled it out.

“Let me out! I want to teach this kid a lesson!”Tie Dan’s voice sounded urgent in his mind.

Qin Yu ignored him. He held the sword with both hands, and killing intent shot out of his eyes.

Then, the internal Qi in Qin Yu’s body rushed into the bronze sword.

Buzz

The bronze sword in Qin Yu’s hand kept buzzing, and it let out a sound that sounded like the wails of ghosts and howls of wolves.

Rays of light appeared on the bronze sword!

This technique was the absolute beginning nine slashes!

Facing this almighty body, Qin Yu didn’t dare to be negligent at all. He raised his hand and unleashed the third slash of the absolute beginning nine slashes!

“Go to Hell!”

Qin Yu let out an angry roar and his body rose up from the ground!

He held the sword with both hands and ruthlessly slashed towards white bones!

A terrifying sword ray descended from the sky and slashed down majestically!

Under Qin Yu’s urging, that incomparably sharp sword blade slashed at white bones!

“Chi la!”

Under this sword attack, White Bones’body was actually smashed into the ground!

Not only that, a white scar appeared on his palm that he used to block!

“It worked!”Qin Yu was instantly overjoyed when he saw this!

Even the star picking hand, star picking’s trump card, had only left a white scar.

Qin Yu was already strong enough to leave a white scar with a half-step martial saint!

The crowd not far away also widened their eyes when they saw this!

“Qin Yu’s swordsmanship is actually so strong?”

“I always thought that his strongest point was his physical body. I didn’t expect that his sword was also so powerful!”

Yan Jinyao frowned tightly.

He also didn’t Expect Qin Yu to be able to hurt the white bone.

On the battlefield, Qin Yu held the bronze sword and kept retreating.

His initial excitement turned into worry in the blink of an eye.

Qin Yu knew very well that the nine slashes of the absolute beginning was Qin Yu’s trump card.

But even so, it only left a white mark.

Wanting to shatter this white bone was almost impossible.

“Qin Yu, you do have some ability. This sword technique is probably a heaven rank technique,”not far away, Tian Xuehong said indifferently.

“Unfortunately, such a sword technique like this, you shouldn’t be able to slash it many times.”

After saying this, Tian Xuehong waved his hand, and the white bone immediately rushed towards Qin Yu.

Qin Yu did not dare to be negligent, and could only grab his sword and hurriedly respond.

For a moment, the sound of “Dang dang dang”could be heard continuously.

The white bone used his steel body to continuously smash towards the bronze sword in Qin Yu’s hand.

The huge impact caused Qin Yu’s wrist to feel pain, and it was almost broken.

“Boom!”

Finally, under the powerful attack of the white bone, the bronze sword in Qin Yu’s hand fell off again!

Before Qin Yu could react, white bones threw another punch at Qin Yu’s chest.

“Clang!”

Qin Yu’s body was sent flying dozens of meters away in an instant, and his mouth was bleeding non-stop!

“Kill him for me!”Tian Xuehong shouted.

White bones seemed to have gone mad when he received the order. Both his speed and strength increased rapidly!

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely unsightly. He immediately executed the line word incantation and quickly grabbed the sword in his hand, responding in a hurry.

In just a few short seconds, white bones had already thrown out dozens of punches.

Even though Qin Yu held the bronze sword tightly, he was still shaken until he could not stop vomiting blood.

“Kid, if this continues, I’m afraid you’re going to die.”Iron Egg’s voice sounded in his mind.

Qin Yu clenched his teeth, his face gloomy and uncertain.

Not far away, everyone could not help but stand up, staring at Qin Yu who was fighting with blood. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Their hearts were in their throats.

“Damn it, let’s Go All Out!”Qin Yu seized the opportunity and shot back dozens of meters.

At this moment, Qin Yu was seriously injured, and the hand holding the sword was trembling slightly.

Qin Yu stabbed the sword fiercely into the ground, and his palm quickly slid.

In a moment, a huge “Dou”character appeared in front of him!

“Dou character?”Tie Dan was even more shocked when he saw this scene.

“How do you have the nine secrets?”

Qin Yu did not have the time to bother with Tie Dan. After using the Dou character, Qin Yu’s strength instantly increased tenfold!

That powerful aura instantly swept across the entire arena!

“Dou character... he actually has the Dou character!”Yan Jinyao’s pupils constricted again!

He had tried to find the nine secrets, but failed. He didn’t expect that Qin Yu had learned the real fighting formula!

With the help of fighting formula, Qin Yu’s strength had stepped into another level.

He grabbed the bronze sword and narrowed his eyes. Internal Qi burst out from his body and poured into the bronze sword.

“The first nine cuts, the fourth cut!”

With Qin Yu’s furious roar, Qin Yu’s body rose up from the ground!

An even more terrifying sword light lit up the sky in an instant!
