Chapter 1251: Chapter 1,251, how about the bet? 

The light quickly spread throughout his body and returned to the god testing stone.

Everyone’s eyes were fixed on the god testing stone, as if they wanted to witness a miracle.

Soon, a number appeared on the god testing stone.

After seeing this number, everyone couldn’t help but be stunned.

“This... how is this possible!”Di Zun was the first to exclaim.

“There’s a problem, there must be a problem with the testing God Stone!”

Zi he and Zi Ru could not help but burst out laughing.

“This is your number one person in the world?”Zi he sneered.

He looked at Qin Yu and said, “Come, number one person in the world, Shout Out Your Number.”

Qin Yu stared at the number on the testing God stone and couldn’t help but frown.

This number was actually a single digit, only three.

No one could believe that Qin Yu’s number was so low.

“This... There must be a problem!”Di Zun said anxiously.

“Oh? There’s a problem? I don’t mind you doing it again.”Zi he pushed the testing God stone forward and said indifferently.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “There’s no need for that. I know what the problem is.”

“Oh? What a coincidence? I also know what the problem is with you.”Zi he sneered.

“There’s only one problem, and that is that you are a good-for-nothing!”

“Impossible! My Master’s talent is beyond your imagination!”Di Zun shouted.

Zi he sneered and said, “Di Zun, this kind of person isn’t worthy of being your master. Come and follow our elder Bai.”

Not only zi he and the others, the others couldn’t help but be dumbstruck.

Qin Yu’s talent was obvious. It was absolutely impossible for it to be in single digits.

And the few mighty figures behind Qin Yu were even more despairing.

From the looks of it, not to mention bringing them to the holy region, even Qin Yu himself would find it difficult.

“The spiritual energy in my body suddenly disappeared a year ago. That’s why my spiritual energy value is extremely low,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Hearing this, Zi he sneered and said, “So, you’re just a trash who can’t cultivate? Such a trash also wants to go to the Holy Region?”

Behind him, elder Bai also glanced at Qin Yu, then shook his head and said, “Indeed, there’s no spiritual energy fluctuation.”

“Without the support of spiritual energy, he’s just a piece of trash!”Zi Ru snorted lightly.

These people called him trash one after another, which couldn’t help but make Qin Yu unhappy.

He took a deep breath and suppressed his anger, saying, “It’s because I’m tainted by the Twilight Energy, so...”

“Stop talking nonsense, hurry up and get lost.”Zi he impatiently interrupted Qin Yu’s words.

“Such trash wants to head to the Holy Region? What a joke.”

Finally, under his endless humiliation, Qin Yu couldn’t hold it in any longer.

He looked at Zi he coldly, he said, “It’s true that there is no spiritual energy fluctuation in my body, but that doesn’t mean anything. Even if I don’t have any spiritual energy, killing you is as easy as chopping melons and vegetables. You keep calling me trash. Do you really think that you are someone superior?”

As soon as he said that, everyone was shocked!

Zi He and the others were the ushers from the holy region. Almost everyone was kowtowing to them, so no one dared to argue with them!

However, Qin Yu’s words instantly tore the skin off their faces!

Zi He’s expression turned cold, and he said coldly, “What did you say?”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “I said, even if I don’t have any spiritual energy, killing you will be effortless.”

“Hahahaha!”Zi he could not help but burst into laughter.

“Did you hear what he said? A trash who can’t cultivate actually said such arrogant words!”

Zi Ru and the others also sneered and said, “Kid, I think you are crazy. Why? Are you planning to sacrifice your own life? Do you know who senior brother Zi he is?”

Qin Yu did not have the mood to quarrel with them. He looked at Zi he coldly and said, “How about this, you and I will fight. If I win, you let me and my friends go to the Holy Region. How about it?” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Sure!”Zi he agreed without even thinking.

He sneered, “Then what if you lose?”

“If I lose, you can do whatever you want with me. Of course, I Can’t lose,”Qin Yu said coldly.

A strange expression appeared on Zi He’s face.

He said in a strange tone, “You’re so brave. A trash who can’t cultivate is still spouting nonsense here. Fine, I’ll agree to it! If you lose, you can go to hell!”

Qin Yu took a step back and said coldly, “Come.”

Zi He didn’t say any nonsense. As a mighty realm expert, he naturally had absolute confidence.

What’s more, he was facing a trash who had no spiritual power at all.

His body shook, and in the blink of an eye, he arrived in front of Qin Yu.

“Kid, it’s not too late for you to regret it now,”zi he said indifferently.

Qin Yu laughed coldly in his heart.

Before he had absorbed Yan Ruoxue’s blood, his physical body had already surpassed that of a mighty figure.

Now that he had absorbed the blood, Qin Yu’s body had long entered an incomparably abnormal state!

Although there were no fluctuations of spirit energy in his body, the divine power in Qin Yu’s body could move mountains and overturn seas!

“I admire your courage to face death with ease.”Zi he narrowed his eyes slightly, and the internal Qi on his body surged rapidly.

The strength of a mighty realm expert erupted at this moment!

It was as if everyone could feel the pressure coming from his body!

A mighty figure at his peak was many times stronger than that reclusive mighty figure!

However, Qin Yu did not panic in the slightest. There was even a hint of ridicule on his face.

Zi he could clearly see this ridicule.

His expression turned cold as he shouted, “Today, I will teach you a lesson, this brat who doesn’t know the immensity of Heaven and Earth!”

With that, his hand held a radiance that was as bright as the sun and the Moon as it headed straight for Qin Yu’s face!

This punch was full of power and could be said to be able to crush a dead branch as easily as breaking a rotten branch. Even the space itself was shaking with a loud bang!

However, Qin Yu remained calm. He suddenly raised his hand and grabbed zi he’s fist.

Vast divine power surged out at this moment and appeared on his palm, causing people to be greatly shocked!
