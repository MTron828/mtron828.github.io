Chapter 1216: Chapter 1,216, news of the formation flag 

Professor Ji arranged accommodation for Qin Yu and the rest. At the same time, he also arranged for mercenaries to adjust the military equipment and prepare to face the demon beasts.

There were many demon beasts here. Although it was an isolated island, the demon beasts here were rampant.

According to Professor Ji, there were once residents on this island, and it was not a small city-state.

It was precisely because of the wanton slaughter of the demonic beasts here that a city-state was destroyed, and countless people died here.

At night, Professor Chicken poured a glass of wine for Qin Yu. The two of them sat on the beach, enjoying the sea breeze.

Ever since he saw Qin Yastonishing physique, Professor Chicken started to have mischievous thoughts.

Taking advantage of the alcohol, professor chicken said, “Can I take a tube of your blood and use it for our research institute? I’ve never heard of a physique like yo”

Qin Yu thought for a moment. A tube of blood didn’t matter, so he nodded and agreed.

After receiving Qin Yaffirmative answer, professor chicken was so excited that he was dancing with joy.

“By the way, who is that pervert you mentioned before?”Qin Yu was puzzled.

Professor chicken said, “It’s a stranger. He’s about the same age as you. He has endured eight tubes of strengthening agent.”

Qin Yu didn’t think much of it. In his opinion, any martial artist could take the strengthening agent.

After three rounds of drinking, it was getting late. The wind blowing from the seaside also became a bit cold.

“At night, it’s the time when these underwater creatures come and go,”professor ji said.

He took out his cell phone, flipped through the photo album and said, “Look, these people died at their hands.”

In the photo, there were a large number of corpses, which looked terrible.

The island was even more dilapidated, with rocks rolling down.

According to Dr. Chicken, the local people had sent warriors to fight with this demon beast many times, but in the end, they all suffered heavy casualties.

Qin Yew very well that demon beasts didn’t like humans, so they attacked humans.

This kind of thing couldn’t be said to be right or wrong. Everyone was doing it for survival. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

For demonic beasts, especially those without divine sense, they could only obey the most basic laws of the dark forest.

In such an environment, there was no way to be humane, and even less to be compassionate.

“Alright, yoould go back and rest first. If there are demonic beasts around tonight, there will be a big battle.”Professor Chicken put his hands behind his back, showing an impressive posture of giving pointers.

Qin Yiled and said, “I think I should stay behind to prevent any problems.”

“Yoould hurry back. That huge battle will be a bloodbath.”Professor Chicken said calmly.

Qin Yu wanted to repeat himself and tell him that these equipment could not harm the sea chicken. However, Qin Yew that Professor Chicken would not believe him, so he did not insist.

The night passed peacefully. The sea chicken didn’t come.

It seemed that the corpse of the sea chicken was useless.

However, Qin Yu was also waiting for the opening of the Saint Realm, so he wasn’t in a hurry, so he brought everyone to stay.

In the blink of an eye, three days passed.

During these three days, the sea chicken didn’t appear.

The sea chicken chicks on the shore had already rotted and were almost rotten.

“Looks like it won’t be easy to find this sea chicken,”Qin Yid.

Professor chicken said, “Don’t be anxious. Wait a little longer. We have other methods.”

During these three days, Qin Yu followed Professor Chicken and visited their laboratory and research process.

It had to be said that this was a group of extremely crazy and knowledgeable doctors. People who focused on learning were quite admirable.

“Mr. Qin, according to this progress, how much longer do we have to wait?”Some of the soldiers seemed to be unable to wait any longer.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Let’s Wait a little longer. Doctor Chicken said that they have a way. Just treat it as taking advantage of these few days off.”

If you wanted something, you had to pay a price. Paying a little time was probably the smallest price.

That night.

Qin Yu lay on the bed and looked at his phone.

At this moment, his phone suddenly rang.

He picked up the phone and saw that it was an unfamiliar number.

Qin Yu picked up the phone and asked suspiciously, “Who are you?”

Someone on the other end said, “Are you Mr. Qin, Qin Yu?”

Qin Yid, “It’s me.”

The other party quickly said, “I saw your post on the Martial Arts Forum. You’re looking for a flag, right?”

“That’s right. Don’t tell me you have it?”Qin Yu hurriedly sat up from the bed.

The other party agreed and said, “I don’t have it, but I have a clue.”

“Okay, what clue?”Qin Yu hurriedly asked.

The other party smiled embarrassedly and said, “Yoid that if you provide a clue, you can fulfill one condition, right? Any Condition?”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “As long as it’s not too excessive, I will agree.”

“En...”the other party was silent for a moment, and then he smiled embarrassedly and said, “I only have one condition. I want to be your disciple, is that okay?”

Hearing this, Qin Yu was first stunned, then he laughed.

In truth, there had been quite a number of people who wanted to acknowledge Qin Yu as their master in the past few years, but their talent wasn’t that great. In fact, their attitude towards cultivation wasn’t even good.

Qin Yew clearly in his heart that they weren’t doing this to acknowledge him as their master, but to acknowledge him as their master through fame, connections, and connections.

“I might be going to the holy region very soon, so I won’t be able to bring you any social status. What’s the point of you looking for me to acknowledge you as your master?”Qin Yid.

Hearing this, the other party hurriedly said, “No, no, no. I really want to cultivate with you.”

Qin Yu thought for a long time and said, “Alright then. Let’s find some time to meet.”

“Okay, okay!”The other party was immediately overjoyed.

“Now can you tell me about the formation flag?”Qin Yu asked over the phone.
