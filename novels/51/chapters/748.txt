“Shut your mouth,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Qin Yu threw Zhang Yijiu aside and then looked at Tang Sheng. “Mr. Tang, have you heard of the Han Palace?”

Tang Sheng nodded and said, “Yes. The Han Palace has been famous for many years. It’s said that many top Martial Saints are sleeping in their sects.”

“But I don’t know whether it’s true or not.”

“Sleeping Martial Saints? What do you mean?” Qin Yu didn’t seem to understand.

The man with the mustache on the side explained, “Although it’s said to be sleeping Martial Saints, it’s actually a wisp of the Martial Saint’s remnant soul. Its purpose is to protect the sect and prevent a disaster from happening.”

“That’s right.” Tang Sheng nodded.

“To tell you the truth, the Tang family is the same.”

Upon hearing this, Qin Yu suddenly understood.

No wonder Tang Sheng said that they weren’t afraid of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association in Tang City!

“Qin Yu, you’d better be careful. The Han Palace isn’t easy to deal with,” Tang Sheng reminded him.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “It doesn’t matter. Since they’re sleeping Martial Saints, there’s nothing to be afraid of.”

“Moreover... I really hope that they can send more people,” Qin Yu said with a nonchalant smile.

For Qin Yu, swallowing Golden Cores was the fastest way to cultivate.

Therefore, the more enemies there were, the faster Qin Yu’s cultivation speed would be.

After having a meal at the Tang family, Qin Yu brought Zhang Yijiu back to his mansion.

Sitting in this mansion, Qin Yu sipped his tea and said, “Zhang Yijiu, I’m giving you a chance to live, but you have to listen to me.”

At this time, Zhang Yijiu had recovered some of her strength.

She had an idea, and said coquettishly, “Okay, whatever you want me to do, I’ll listen to you.”

Qin Yu took a sip of tea and said indifferently, “I want to know the purpose of the Han Palace snatching this mask, and... how they will use this mask.”

“You want me to be your spy?” A trace of panic flashed across Zhang Yijiu’s face.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “You can think of it this way.”

Zhang Yijiu frowned and said, “No, if the Sect Master finds out, he will kill me.”

“You think I won’t kill you?” Qin Yu said coldly.

Zhang Yijiu’s expression was gloomy and uncertain. A trace of craftiness flashed across her eyes.

“I will promise him, and as long as I leave this place, I will never come back!” Zhang Yijiu thought to herself.

“You’d better not try to lie to me.” However, Qin Yu had seen through her thoughts.

After saying that, Qin Yu raised his finger, and a thread of golden light flew towards Zhang Yijiu’s glabella.

Zhang Yijiu’s expression changed. She wanted to stop it, but in her current state, there was no way she could stop it.

The golden mark entered the glabella of Zhang Yijiu. Not only that, the light kept drilling into her mind.

The intense pain made Zhang Yijiu moan, and her body trembled.

“What did you do to me?!” Zhang Yijiu said in pain.

Qin Yu smiled nonchalantly and said, “I fused the mark with your divine sense. If you want to erase the mark, you have to destroy your divine sense.”

“You!” Zhang Yijiu’s expression instantly turned extremely ugly!

She gritted her teeth and said, “You are so cruel!”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Of course, you can also choose to be loyal to Han Palace. I can kill you right now.”

As he spoke, Qin Yu stood up.

His body carried a bone-piercing chill, and his killing intent was even more chilling.

Facing death, Zhang Yijiu was finally afraid.

She hurriedly said, “I’ll agree to it! But I’m not sure if our Sect Master will tell me.”

Qin Yu said with a nonchalant smile, “That’s your business. By the way, if you can’t get any information, I can destroy your divine sense at any time.”

Zhang Yijiu clenched his teeth and said, “I got it.”

Only then did Qin Yu nod in satisfaction.

“Just wait. I’ll recover your internal qi as soon as possible.” Qin Yu stood up and turned to return to the room.

About an hour later.

Qin Yu walked out with a few pills in his hands.

“Take this pill and you can leave,” Qin Yu said.

Zhang Yijiu asked cautiously, “What is this?”

“Don’t worry. This is a pill to recover your internal qi. If I wanted to kill you, I wouldn’t need to waste my energy.” Qin Yu rolled his eyes.

Zhang Yijiu seemed to think that it made sense. She took the pill and swallowed it.

The moment the pill entered her stomach, her inner strength slowly recovered. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

In a moment, Zhang Yijiu’s body recovered its strength.

“Qin Yu, I should have killed you earlier!” Zhang Yijiu looked at Qin Yu and couldn’t help but gnash her teeth.

Qin Yu sneered. “Don’t forget what I said. I’m not joking with you.”

Zhang Yijiu snorted coldly. She turned around and left without saying a word.

After she left, Qin Yu calculated the time.

There were only five days left to the date he had agreed with the Heaven Swallowing Python.

“It’s time to return to Jingdu.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

As long as he defeated the Heaven Swallowing Python this time, Qin Yu would know which Mystic Realm Yan Ruoxue was locked in!

At that time, Qin Yu would have a way to save Yan Ruoxue!

The next day.

Qin Yu brought the man with the mustache, Xiao Yu, and the others to the Tang family’s lobby.

“Are you ready to leave?” Asked Tang Sheng.

Qin Yu bowed and said, “Yes. Thank you for taking care of me during this time, Mr. Tang.”

However, Tang Sheng waved his hand and said, “I’m not taking care of you. I’m just doing it for the Tang family.”

“Qin Yu, come back and play when you have time,” said Tang Mo with a smile.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Don’t worry, Young Master Tang. I’ll definitely come back when I have time.”

After bidding farewell to the Tang family, Qin Yu, man with the mustache, and Xiao Yu set out on the road back to Jingdu.

Jingdu.

Ever since Blackie fought against Jiang He, his reputation had soared.

Almost everyone regarded him as the number one person in the world.

Even Yan Jinyao had been outshadowed.

Although Blackie and Yan Jinyao didn’t fight, everyone was more inclined to Blackie.

Although Yan Jinyao wasn’t happy about this, he wasn’t anxious.

“Young Master Yan, are you really inferior to Blackie?” An attendant beside Yan Jinyao asked.

Yan Jinyao sneered. “I’m inferior to him? He’s just a beast. What right does he have to be compared to me?”

“But... now ,the outside world thinks that Blackie’s strength is above yours,” someone said.

Yan Jinyao sneered. “How can these ants know what bloodline power is?”

“Normally speaking, the strength of Earth Rank demonic beasts is indeed above that of humans, but the so-called demonic beasts aren’t worth mentioning in front of bloodline power!”

As he spoke, Yan Jinyao’s hands gathered waves of energy.

His palm slapped forward, and the Black Gold Stone in front of him was smashed into pieces!

“This is the power of a bloodline,” Yan Jinyao said coldly.
