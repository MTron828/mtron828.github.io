Chapter 449: Bullsh*t Organization!! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Ten half-step Martial Marquises, with all sorts of different identities, were marching towards Pyro!

This was practically the largest scale movement in the history of the Hong Yi Sect!

No one knew why the Hong Yi Sect would deploy such a large force, and discussions broke out all at once.

Some said that the Hong Yi Sect wanted to use this opportunity to tell the world about the power that the Hong Yi Sect possessed.

Some people also said that the Hong Yi Sect had placed too much importance on Qin Yu’s potential.

Some people even said that this news was fake.

Only the Hong Yi Sect knew the truth.

They knew very well what it meant to have a fully grown chaotic body.

... . .

Early the next morning Qin Yu departed from Sea City’s airport with Fang Yue while preparing to head towards Dongchuan.

Dongchuan was very far from Sea City and its location was in the easternmost part of Pyro.

There were many old forests deep in the mountains here, so the cultivation environment was very good. Many top-notch martial artists had once gone into seclusion in Dongchuan.

On the plane, Qin Yu looked at Fang Yue, who was lying on the side, and couldn’t help but sigh.

“Fang Yue, I never thought that there would be times when you miscalculated.” Qin Yu shook his head helplessly.

The incantation that He Teng chanted was extremely strange, and it seemed to trigger the Spirit Pills in one’s body.

But for some reason, this incantation was useless against Qin Yu.

There were too many cultivation methods in the world, and countless strange methods.

If one wasn’t careful, it was very likely that one would fall into a state of eternal damnation.

In the afternoon, the plane finally stopped at Dongchuan.

Once he got off the plane, Qin Yu couldn’t help but take a deep breath.

The smell of nature always made people feel a sense of yearning.

Then, Qin Yu took a taxi and prepared to go straight to the Meng family!

As the king of Dongchuan, practically everyone in Dongchuan knew about Meng Wuxiong.

“Meng Wuxiong is a well-known figure in Dongchuan!” At the mention of Meng Wuxiong, the driver began to blabber.

“At first, he started out as an engineer. Later, for some unknown reason, he began to practice some kind of kung fu. It seems that he’s quite impressive.”

Qin Yu asked casually, “What is Meng Wuxiong’s net worth?”

When the driver heard this, he said mysteriously, “Rumor has it that he has tens of billions of assets on the surface! There are dozens of hired thugs in his family!”

The thugs that the driver mentioned should be the hangers-on of the Meng family.

Soon, the car arrived at a manor.

“This is the Meng family manor,” the driver pointed to the manor and said.

Qin Yu got out of the car and stared at the large manor. He couldn’t help but feel stunned.

Because... This manor was too extravagant! It was more like a forest than a manor!

It was as if the entire mountain had been wrapped up and turned into personal real estate!

There were at least dozens of villas in the manor. Each one was extremely luxurious.

There were all kinds of different styles!

“Meng Wuxiong is really extravagant.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

To say that he had ten billion family assets was probably underestimating him.

Qin Yu didn’t waste any time. He carried Fang Yue and walked towards the manor.

The entrance of the manor was grand and solemn. On the two huge stone tablets, names were carved one after another.

Just as Qin Yu was about to shout out loud, he suddenly felt a trace of a strange internal qi around him.

“Someone is following me?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

There seemed to be two vague streams of internal qi in the dark.

Although the internal qi had been concealed, it still couldn’t escape Qin Yu’s divine sense.

“Two Inner Strength Grandmasters?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and then sneered.

...

In the dark, two Inner Strength Grandmasters wearing night clothes were staring at Qin Yu.

“Report to Mr. Xia immediately. Tell him that Qin Yu has come to Dongchuan,” one of the Inner Strength Grandmasters said.

The other Inner Strength Grandmaster nodded. He took out his phone and was about to make a call when they suddenly realized that Qin Yu had disappeared!

“Where is he?!” The two of them hurriedly stood up and looked for Qin Yu everywhere.

However, the entire forest was silent. Where was Qin Yu?

“Oh no, we lost him!”

“If Mr. Xia finds out, we’ll be in trouble. Hurry up and look for him!”

“Are you looking for me?”

Just as the two of them raised their heads, they suddenly felt a cold breeze behind them!

After turning around, they saw Qin Yu looking at them with a smile.

“How... How did you find us?!” One of the Inner Strength Grandmasters said.

Qin Yu sneered. “With your clumsy methods, you actually want to stalk other people? Go home and practice.”

The two were humiliated, and their expressions naturally didn’t look good.

“Tell me, who told you to come?” Qin Yu asked indifferently.

The two said with some pride, “We are from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”

“Jingdu Martial Arts Association?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

This surprised him somewhat.

“Why are you following me? What’s your purpose?” Qin Yu continued to ask.

“Hehe, the people of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association have the right to supervise any martial artist!” The other party said indifferently.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and sneered. “Bullsh*t! What does the Jingdu Martial Arts Association do?”

Their expressions changed, and they immediately shouted, “Qin Yu, do you know what you’re talking about?!”

“The Jingdu Martial Arts Association is the highest authority amongst all martial artists! It’s also an organization with the highest power!”

“Bullsh*t!” Qin Yu scolded mercilessly.

“The highest authority? Don’t think that I don’t know what kind of business you guys are doing.”

He abhored the Martial Arts Association.

All the Martial Arts Associations that Qin Yu had seen were all doing shady business.

Last time, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association controlled the Martial Arts Forum and smeared Qin Yu.

How could such an organization be called the highest authority?

“You are just a non-governmental organization. Why are you guys pretending to be the authorities?” Qin Yu sneered.

“If everyone respects you, you guys are considered esteemed. If they don’t respect you guys, who do you guys think you are?”

The two of them were rendered speechless by Qin Yu’s words, and their faces turned red.

“Tell me, why are you following me? If you can’t explain it today, I will kill you two prideful jerks,” Qin Yu said coldly. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Their expressions changed, and they exclaimed, “How dare you! No one dares to touch people from our Martial Arts Association!”

“Is that so?” Qin Yu sneered and immediately slapped him!

This slap made the corner of the Inner Strength Grandmaster’s mouth bleed, and his face swelled.

“You... you actually dared to hit me?!”

“Not only do I dare to hit you, but I also dare to kill you,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The two of them were scared, and they braced themselves and said, “Vice president Xia asked us to come. We don’t know the specific reason.”

“Vice President Xia? Xia Hang?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

“Yes,” they answered.

Qin Yu frowned.

Wasn’t Xia Hang Han Wei’s Mentor? Why would he send people to follow him?

“Can we leave now?” The two of them asked tentatively.

Qin Yu glanced at them and waved his hand. “Get lost. But I’m warning you guys. If you guys follow me again, I’ll kill you guys without hesitation.”

The two of them didn’t dare to say anything more. After nodding repeatedly, they turned around and ran.

Qin Yu stood on the mountain rock and didn’t move for a long time.

Although he didn’t know what Xia Hang’s purpose was, Qin Yu knew that Xia Hang definitely didn’t have any good intentions.

“Forget it, I don’t care about him. As long as I step into the half-step Martial Marquis realm, Xia Hang won’t be a threat,” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.
