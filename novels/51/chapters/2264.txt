2265 The Battle Against the Three Brothers

“Hmph, don’t overestimate your abilities!”

His divine sense suddenly froze, and the hole in the void instantly disappeared. The terrifying palm was about to hit Zong Yue’s face.

“Smack!”

Five clear palm prints appeared on his face. Mu Tian saw the situation was not good and rushed forward and took the blow for Zong Yue.

They did not expect Mu Yu to fail to resist Qin Yu’s palm.

“You really reared some good dogs, huh? Is this reason sufficient for speaking loudly? You’re nothing but a dog that relies on others’ power.”

Qin Yu sneered and said.

“Kill him!”

Zong Yue’s face contorted to the extreme. Hearing Qin Yu’s strange voice, his pupils filled with rage.”

“Hehe, idiot, you even dare to provoke Zong Yue? You’re a brainless fellow!”

The corners of Xing Mou’s mouth curled up into a cold smile. The second most powerful person on this mainland was not just for show. It could still exhaust Qin Yu to death, even if it was just a matter of exhaustion.

“What the f*ck are you laughing at?”

With a movement of his body, Qin Yu had already shaken off the lock of his divine sense by the three elders.

He directly punched Xing Mou’s bow, which made a creaking sound. The terrifying force directly sent Xing Mou flying, and he spat a large mouthful of blood.

“You’re courting death!”

The soul cultivator’s divine sense let out a terrifying howl. In that howl, an incomparably giant tiger rushed toward the sky, bringing along with it an internal qi that made one’s divine sense fearful as it charged toward Qin Yu.

“Are you playing circus tricks with me?”

The fierce tiger rushed into Qin Yu’s divine sense and started to bite crazily, but Qin Yu did not even move.

Qin Yu stepped forward and landed before Xing Mou.”I’ve said it. I’m very vengeful. I’m returning the arrow you shot in purgatory to you.”

With a heaven-shattering aura in the kick, Qin Yu kicked out directly.

“Clang!”

“What terrifying brute force.”

Wu Feng raised the black and heavy saber and pointed it in the air at Qin Yu.

A terrifying mountain-like pressure instantly fell on Qin Yu’s body. Cracks like fine spider webs appeared on the eaves and the walls of the entire big hall.

“Severed Wave.”

As the saber slashed down, the air seemed to be sucked out of the middle of the sea. A hurricane instantly blew up on both sides, and the entire hall was instantly blown away into countless gravels.

A mountain-like heavy blade smashed onto Qin Yu’s shoulder, and the tremendous force caused the space to emit a distorted sound.”

“D*mn it, flashy and superficial!”

Qin Yu’s shoulder shook, and that heavy blade directly bounced off. His shoulder was as smooth as snow without a scratch on it.

And beneath his feet, there was not even a fragment of shattered stone.

“What a terrifying physical body! Did you see the floor beneath his feet not move at all? His body didn’t dissolve the massive force, but he took it head-on and swallowed it. He had to endure three times the force!”

Mu Tian looked a little wary.

“Shut up. I’ll make him die here today.”

Zong Yue cried out in a mournful and sharp voice.”

“Are you barking at me again?”

Qin Yu sent Wu Feng flying with a kick and came before Zong Yue.

“Oh my god, can you shut up?”

The three brothers’ expressions changed drastically, and they almost strangled Zong Yue to death in their hearts. However, they did not dare to be negligent. If anything happened to Zong Yue, the three would not be far from death.

Qin Yu suddenly slapped him hard.

Mu Tian suddenly blocked Qin Yu’s palm, his hands trembling from the impact. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The three brothers’ faces turned cold. “Brat, you’re unappreciative and being overboard, aren’t you?”

“That’s right. I’m going to tear off this brat’s face so that he won’t keep disgusting me. No one can save him today.”

Qin Yu said with a cold smile. Zong Yue had already provoked him many times. He would be lawless if he did not teach him a lesson now.

The cosmic form propped up, and a giant god statue suddenly appeared on Qin Yu’s back. The god statue emitted a terrifying internal qi, and the colossal palm slammed downward fiercely.

The three elders suddenly attacked simultaneously, clashing with the colossal palm.

With his terrifying physical body and cosmic form, even the three brothers could not withstand a single palm strike.

Mu Tian brought Zong Yue out. The other two fiercely resisted it and moved to the side.

When the palm landed, a bottomless pit instantly appeared on the ground.

“What a terrifying cultivation technique and physical strength.”

Wu Feng gasped.

Previously when they met Qin Yu, his strength was still very ordinary in their eyes. They did not expect him to become so terrifying in such a short time.

“You’ll definitely die. In the future, in this galaxy, my Blood Sect will not rest until you die. Even when you are resting, my Blood Sect will still keep an eye on you. We will also take care of everyone related to you.”

Zong Yue laughed sinisterly. No one had ever been so arrogant before him.

Zong Yue had been standing at the top of this galaxy since he was born. All the resources were within his reach, but his aptitude was extremely ordinary, so he harbored a twisted mentality toward those with high talents.

“I remember now. In Solitary Cloud City back then, you almost killed me. Now, it seems you are not only trash but also extremely stupid.”

Qin Yu said with a smile. At that time, Zong Yue had ordered a cultivator to violate the rules and almost kill him. Qin Yu’s gaze at Zong Yue instantly turned cold.

“Who did you call trash?!”

Zong Yue screamed.

“I was referring to you. I originally wanted to spare your life, but I didn’t expect your mouth to be so talkative. I’ll feel sorry for your mouth if I don’t kill you today.”

Qin Yu’s cosmic form propped up, and a giant hand swept out.

Mu Tian jumped up to Zong Yue and blocked it with both hands. In the next moment, he was sent flying by a terrifying force that made him spit out blood.

Mu Yu arrived behind Qin Yu at this moment. All of the spiritual power in his body erupted, and he clawed at Qin Yu’s back.

Qin Yu suddenly turned around, and a golden light appeared on his fist. He directly punched out with the Saintly Body Technique.

Mu Yu’s arm and a big part of his shoulder were crushed instantly.

“Go to hell!”

Mu Fan took advantage of the moment Qin Yu punched out and threw a full-force punch at Qin Yu’s side. His entire body was burning with vigor, and a terrifying momentum erupted instantly.

In a split second, the three brothers had already gone all out.

Qin Yu flicked the Suo Lin Divine Artifact with his left hand, and a giant shield instantly blocked the terrifying punch.

“Hiss!”

Shui Yuan and Nangong Qi gasped. In that instant, two of the three elders of the Blood Sect had already been injured.

Moreover, two of the three were already in the eighth grade of the True Saint, but it was almost one-sided when dealing with a fourth-grade True Saint.

“What are you doing? Quickly kill him!”

Zong Yue’s expression contorted.

“Big Brother!”

Mu Yu and Mu Fan suddenly spoke, their faces filled with determination.
