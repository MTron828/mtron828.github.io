Chapter 1424: Chapter 1,424“A legend”Xiao Hai 1

Zhuo Jing was extremely kind to Qin Yu, so Qin Yu was naturally very grateful.

He put away the token, bowed, and said, “Brother Zhuo, I will always remember this favor.”

After saying goodbye to Zhuo Jing, Qin Yu took advantage of the night to rush to the Qingyan Forest.

Along the way, Qin Yu saw countless border guards looking for him.

Fortunately, Qin Yu’s movement technique was agile. In addition, the Heavenly Cloud sect didn’t have that many people, so qin yu successfully browsed through the cities.

“I can’t go to any of the cities,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Every city had a border guard. Once one entered, it would be very difficult to come out.

Along the way, Qin Yu rushed towards Qingyan Forest on foot.

After traveling for a few days, he was still not far from Qingyan Forest.

One day, while Qin Yu was on his way, he suddenly noticed several figures in the sky. A powerful aura was spreading over.

And below, there were many people gathered here. They raised their heads and stared at this scene.

Qin Yu originally didn’t want to join in the fun, but his curiosity got the better of him. In addition to being physically and mentally exhausted, he took the opportunity to rest.

Therefore, Qin Yu found a place far away from the crowd and sat down.

He raised his head to look at the sky and saw a tall man standing in front of three people.

This man was wearing a mask, so his face couldn’t be seen clearly. Although he had restrained his aura, he could still feel the incomparable temperament on his body.

The three people in front of him were even more powerful. Their bodies were emitting extremely powerful fluctuations, and the space around them was falling off.

“There are still such powerful people in the South Prefecture.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel somewhat astonished when he saw this.

The strength of these three people was most likely at the late stage of the major power realm. Even if they were compared to the first elder, they weren’t the slightest bit inferior.

“The South Prefecture isn’t a place you should come to. You are burning, killing, and plundering in the South Prefecture. Do you think there are no people in the South Prefecture?”The masked man coldly said.

When the three people heard this, they couldn’t help but sneer. “Everyone is doing this for survival. Don’t make yourself sound so noble.”

“If you leave now, I might spare your lives,”the masked man said in a deep voice.

“Hahahaha, what a shameless boast! Let alone a small southern region, even in the entire Li region, the three of us have never been afraid of anyone!”The other party shouted.

“Today, I will let you see the abilities of the three of Us Brothers!”

After the loud shout, the great battle erupted in an instant!

A terrifying and shocking radiance surged from the three of them. That radiance was like a full moon as it surged in all directions.

The spectators below immediately felt an intense pressure. Some even knelt on the ground on the spot, their bodies cracking as they vomited blood

When Qin Yu saw this, he could not help but turn pale with fright!

Such a terrifying aura surged. It was likely not inferior to that of the first elder. In fact, it was even a few times stronger!

At this moment, the masked man made his move. He raised his left hand to protect the people below. His right hand turned into a hand knife as he slashed towards the ray of light.

At the moment of contact, the sky turned into a vast expanse of white.

In a short moment, the three people fell out of the void and spat out blood continuously!

On the other hand, the masked man was actually unharmed. He was still standing in mid-air, looking coldly at the three people.

The three of them naturally would not sit still and wait for death. They gathered their strength and charged forward once again.

For a moment, the sky was filled with explosions. The masked man was fighting against three of them by himself. He was not at a disadvantage at all. In fact, he was suppressing the three of them by one head!

The three of them looked extremely pathetic, while the masked man appeared calm and collected. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The more Qin Yu looked at him, the more shocked he became. Just who was this masked man? He actually had such ability?

“This person’s ability is probably not inferior to Wen wanye or even peerless dance,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

To be able to fight against three experts so easily, it was enough to prove that his strength was far above these three people!

The Closer Qin Yu Got, the closer he got. Soon, he arrived among the crowd of onlookers.

“Who are those people?”Qin Yu patted the person beside him and asked.

The man beside him glanced at Qin Yu and said, “I don’t know where those three people came from. They burned, killed, plundered, and killed countless people. They are first-class evildoers.”

Qin Yu nodded and continued to ask, “What about the one wearing the mask? His ability seems to be extraordinary.”

Hearing this, the man said with some surprise, “You don’t Even Know Him? He is the famous legend of the southern region, Xiao Hai.”

“He is Xiao Hai? Xiao Hai from the legend of the three lunatics and three unique?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but be shocked.

He didn’t expect to meet Xiao Hai Here!

“Yes, Xiao Hai has been looking for the three of them for a long time. I finally met them here today.”The man nodded.

Then, the man suddenly noticed Qin Yu’s appearance.

He frowned and said, “Why do you look a little familiar...”

Qin Yu quickly turned her face to the side and said, “I have a common face. It’s normal to look familiar.”

Just as the man was about to continue asking, the three people fell from the air and crashed into the ground!

Before the crowd could react, Xiao Hai had already slapped down a huge palm from the air.
