Chapter 19: Uncle Wu’s Skepticism Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Yan Ruoxue looked at Su Yan with cold eyes, her face filled with iciness.

“I...” Su Yan glared at her and was about to open her mouth to retort.

Luckily, Zhao Gang covered her mouth in time and then said in a trembling voice, “Miss Yan, she... How can she be qualified to go on stage? Don’t be ridiculous...”

Yan Ruoxue sneered and said, “If she dares to speak out of turn again, she will face the consequences.”

After saying this, Yan Ruoxue ignored Zhao Gang.

“Hmph, isn’t she deliberately messing with us? If they didn’t choose us, why did they shine the light on us?” Su Yan murmured.

“Shut up!” Zhao Gang let out a stern bellow. He could not help but feel vexed. The longer he looked at Su Yan, the more annoyed he felt.

“No, the opportunity that the Zhao family fought so hard for cannot be ruined just like that!” Zhao Gang thought to himself furiously.

His mind was racing as he tried to find a way to salvage the situation.

At the same time, Yan Ruoxue was already dragging Qin Yu off the stage and straight toward the front table.

Everyone seated at the table was people of prominent status. No one from Jiangcheng, except the Mayor, could sit there.

It was impossible not to be nervous in front of these big shots.

But Qin Yu came to his senses. He had been a coward for most of his life, but from now on, he would never be a coward again.

Moreover, in his heart, Qin Yu had already developed feelings for Yan Ruoxue.

If he continued to be a coward, how could he be deserving to be with Yan Ruoxue?

The two walked straight to the table and sat down.

Yan Ruoxue smiled graciously.

Qin Yu also tried to act as natural as possible.

Once the pair sat down, everyone’s gazes were directed at Qin Yu. There was blatant confusion in their eyes.

“Ruoxue, what exactly is this young man’s background? Why is it that I’ve never heard of him before?” At last, a middle-aged man in a traditional Chinese suit asked the question that was on everyone’s mind.

Yan Ruoxue smiled as she said, “Uncle Wu, would you believe me if I tell you he is an up-and-coming big shot?”

Uncle Wu laughed heartily as he said, “So he really has nothing at the moment?”

Yan Ruoxue remained quiet for a moment before answering, “If we are talking about wealth and status, Qin Yu indeed has nothing right now.”

“But... If we are talking about talent and substance, I think he is incredibly rich.”

This statement made Qin Yu blush and his heart race.

But to the crowd, it sounded absurd.

Substance and talent? Who cared about talent and substance in this era? Wealth and power were the only things that could garner people’s respect!

Uncle Wu seemed to have the intention of making things difficult for Qin Yu. He scrutinized him and said, “Young man, Ruoxue has given you such a high evaluation. I wonder what kind of talent you have.”

Qin Yu observed Uncle Wu carefully and then said with a frown, “Uncle Wu, have you been feeling unwell lately? Such as angina pectoris or cardiac irregularities...”

When Uncle Wu heard that, he burst out laughing and said, “You sound like a doctor. Are you a doctor?”

“Sort of,” Qin Yu replied.

Uncle Wu shook his head and said with a slight chuckle, “What a coincidence. I just had a full-body examination a few days ago, and everything was normal.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Uncle Wu, I suggest you check up on your heart.”

When Uncle Wu heard that, he laughed, “I don’t think there’s a need for that.”

“Uncle Wu, I’m telling you the truth.” Qin Yu’s tone became impatient.

Qin Yu could clearly see that in the location of Uncle Wu’s heart, there was black gas.

Even though Qin Yu was not sure what the black gas signified, it was definitely a bad sign.

However, at this moment, Uncle Wu’s expression was already slightly displeased.

“I understand young people’s eagerness to climb to the top, but showing off forcibly, on the contrary, can easily backfire.” Uncle Wu’s tone carried a hint of warning.

If it were not for Yan Ruoxue’s sake, Uncle Wu would have thrown a fit already.

“Young man, Mr. Wu is the chief of the Chuzhou Region, and the one who examined his body is also a doctor of the Chuzhou Region, so you shouldn’t insist on your opinion any longer.” Someone next to him tried to play mediator but could not help letting a laugh slide.

Qin Yu frowned and did not know what to say.

“Ruoxue, you’re still young. You should be more vigilant about who you keep around you,” Uncle Wu advised. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

When Yan Ruoxue heard this, she immediately smiled and said, “I actually think Uncle Wu should take Qin Yu’s advice.”

This made Uncle Wu look a little awkward, but because of Yan Ruoxue’s reputation, he kept his cool.

“Let’s start eating, or the food will get cold.” The person beside him quickly raised a glass of wine to calm the situation.

The atmosphere was harmonious and peaceful, but Uncle Wu’s expression was nowhere near pleasant.

Seeing this, Qin Yu lifted his glass and offered a toast to the man. “Uncle Wu, perhaps I was wrong. Please do not be offended.”

Uncle Wu glanced at Qin Yu with a grunt and turned his head to the side.

Qin Yu was extremely embarrassed with his wine glass left hanging in the air.

He had no choice but to withdraw his hand.

“There is no need to be upset,” said Yan Ruoxue with a smile. She leaned in close to Qin Yu.

“To them, you are just an ordinary person, but for my sake, they will respect you. That is only on the surface, though.”

“If you want to gain the respect of others, prove yourself to them,” Yan Ruoxue said with a wink.

When he met Yan Ruoxue’s gaze, Qin Yu immediately felt that no obstacle could stop him.

He nodded his head determinedly and said, “I will definitely prove to them that your choice is right!”

“I believe in you.” Yan Ruoxue’s gaze made Qin Yu feel smitten.

“Yan... Miss Yan...”

Interrupting Qin Yu was Zhao Gang and Su Yan, who suddenly came over with their glasses of wine.

Zhao Gang was reluctant to bring along the idiotic Su Yan, but if she did not come to apologize, then being forgiven would be close to impossible!

Zhao Gang seriously explained the stakes at hand to Su Yan before biting the bullet and walking over with her.

As she looked at the couple, Yan Ruoxue could not help but smirk with amusement.

Zhao Gang had nervousness written all over his face, and his hand was even trembling as he held the wine glass.

He knew that this woman in front of him could decide the fate of the Zhao family with the wave of a hand.

“Yan... Miss Yan, I was ignorant to have offended you. I hope you will forgive me...” Zhao Gang said in a quivering voice.

He tugged Su Yan’s hand with great force.

Even though Su Yan was unwilling, she apologized and said, “Miss Yan, right? A word of caution. How could you fall for a person like Qin Yu? He’s a total loser who can’t do anything but fold laundry and cook! The word ‘loser’ is a compliment when it comes to the likes of him!”
