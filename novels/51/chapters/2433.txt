Qin Yu sat on the ground, hunched his body, and panted slowly.

Lei Huan put away the Emerald Sea Tide Peak and was silent. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“On the path of cultivation, there will be earth-shattering changes after tribulation. Logically speaking, as a disciple of Thunder Courtyard, we should not have any thoughts about you. However, Thunder Courtyard’s strength is still too weak. During this chaotic time of the Path of Heaven, I’m afraid it’s still difficult to protect with the bloodline. Tianming bloodline is a ray of hope for us. It’s a ray of hope for us to break through again. This kind of power is indeed something that we can’t give up.”

“Martial Uncle, why are you telling this little b*stard all this?”

Hua Zhikong’s expression was ferocious. Seeing Qin Yu unable to stand up, he took a deep breath.

Being able to defeat two of the Lei family’s Supreme Elders at the True Saint Realm and even survive a full-force attack from the number two person of the Lei family, Lei Huan, was already a terrifying achievement.

Given more time, how far would he develop?

Hua Zhikong felt his soul tremble when he thought about it. He was interrupted by Qin Yu’s voice as his imagination was running wild.

“D*mn sissy, shut up. What has it got to do with you when a man speaks?”

Qin Yu turned his head and reprimanded.

“Ugh!”

Hua Zhikong’s vision went black, and he almost could not catch his breath. “D*mn it, calling me a sissy again?

Qin Yu turned to look at Lei Huan.

“Senior, are you afraid that you won’t be able to advance any further? If you

doubt yourself, I’m afraid you’ll have inner demons in the future and can never break through the last step.”

A mocking smile appeared on Qin Yu’s face.

“What I pursue is the pinnacle of power. On the path of cultivation, one should turn all things into one’s own body. This is also the way that has existed since the beginning of this world. In the Degenerate Age, no one could break through the Tribulation Transcending Stage and use the power of tribulation to fight against the Immortal Emperor without falling behind. Do you dare to say his power was comprehended by himself?”

Lei Huan shook his head. He said so much not because he felt guilty.

It was because Qin Yu was able to withstand his move, and he respected him.

“Kid, you can go now. If it wasn’t for the fact that a genius like you has a death feud with my Lei family, I wouldn’t want to destroy a seedling like you.” Lei Huan stepped forward and reached his palm out to grab Qin Yu’s head.

“How can you be so sure that I will die here?”

In an instant, Qin Yu revealed a mocking cold smile. Finally, he had to use the second thing.

“The Yao family’s Immortal Emperor, please attack!”

A withered hand slowly stretched out from the void and grabbed Lei Huan.

Thunder Eight Trigrams!

In that instant, Lei Huan seemed to sense the signs of death.

Once again, he unleashed his utmost power and slammed it against the palm.

However, the Emerald Sea Tide Peak did not trigger any power when it landed on the palm.

The thunder sea was instantly crushed by the palm. The sea of the Path of Heaven was as fragile as a child’s toy in front of this palm.

The palm was without aura and lightly slapped toward Lei Huan.

Immortal Emperor! It was really an Immortal Emperor!

Lei Huan’s expression changed drastically. At first, he thought that Qin Yu was putting on an act.

It had been many years of the Path of Heaven since an Immortal Emperor had appeared. However, this instant of contact made him understand that this withered thing in front of him was indeed an Immortal Emperor.

Or be more precise, it was a tremendously weak Immortal Emperor.

This palm was like Lei Li’s Telepathic Finger.

However, it was much stronger than Lei Li. At this moment, Lei Huan’s sea of consciousness was completely affected by this palm.

“Boom!”

A snow-white long brow clashed with the palm like a spear.

Lei Qingye made a move and saved Lei Huan.

“You could actually refine a wisp of the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor’s soul.

However, it isn’t enough to save you. The three souls and seven spirits,

Immortal Emperor has a soul and three spirits that are outside of the Path of Heaven. If you can refine another wisp of soul, I’m afraid we really can’t do anything to you.”

Lei Qingye said weakly.

His body was somewhat frail, like an elderly person who was about to be laid to rest.

However, no one dared to underestimate the number one person in the Lei family.

After a cough, it was as if time had changed, and he became a young man when he attacked.

His body slammed into the Immortal Emperor’s corpse fiercely. With a loud boom, the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor actually stepped back.

A man and a corpse exchanged hundreds of thousands of blows in an instant, just like ordinary people fought on the streets.

When the two exchanged blows, not much power spread out. However, in the eyes of Qin Yu and the others, every time they exchanged blows, it was a direct collision of the power of the Path of Heaven.

Lei Qingye’s body was now the thunder of divine punishment, and every breath and movement was the power of the sea of thunder.

While the Immortal Emperor of the Yao family had used an undetectable method, he could suppress Lei Qingye with a simple palm strike.

“Staff!”

The sky suddenly darkened, and the celestial artifact in Lei Xin’s hand surged into the sky.

Thunderclouds formed, and they were black, purple, red, blue, and yellow.

Five layers of thunderclouds rolled and shuttled. They were almost the thunderclouds derived from the sea of the path of Heaven. Their power was immeasurable.

The Thunder Staff activated the Ninth Heaven Divine Thunder and attacked the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor together with Lei Qingye at the same time.

With the combination of the two attacks, Lei Qingye could finally fight the corpse of the Immortal Emperor without falling behind. “Kill him and imprison Yan Ruoxue at Flower Peak.”

Lei Qingye coughed twice and said softly.

There would be many variables if he waited for the Yan family or other aristocratic families to arrive.

“Immortal Emperor Yao, if I die, you don’t have to care about Lei Qingye. Kill Hua Zhikong first, then Hua Qianjie, and finally kill Lei Qingye and all the Lei family’s Supreme Elders.”

Qin Yu’s divine sense blasted onto the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor, and a cold smile appeared on his face.

“Qin Yu! You b*stard!”

Hua Zhikong was scared out of his wits. At this moment, the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor was slowly looking at him.

Lei Qingye and Lei Huan’s expressions changed drastically. They did not expect Qin Yu to do such a thing.

Although Lei Qingye could suppress Immortal Emperor Yao, he could not do so if Immortal Emperor Yao did not fight him!

“Boom!”

The Ninth Heaven Divine Thunder struck toward the corpse of the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor, but Immortal Emperor Yao managed to dodge it.

The speed of the thunder was too slow for him. Although the Ninth Heaven

Divine Thunder was a threat to his corpse, it was useless if it could not hit him.

After Qin Yu used the Soul Torment Mind Technique to recover a part of his soul, he derived a tiny trace of consciousness. “Qin Yu! Believe it or not, I’ll kill you directly!”

Lei Qingye’s face was full of murderous intent.

“Come on, old b*stard. Let me remind you, you can kill me. Immortal Emperor

Yao can also kill everyone besides you instantly.”

Qin Yu laughed maniacally and walked toward Lei Qingve instead.

“Boom!”

Lei Qingye dared not say anything. He transformed into an enormous bolt of lightning, and the power of his Thunder Body rose to the utmost, afraid that the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor would attack his people.

As long as the corpse of Celestial Saint abandoned Lei Qingye, the others would be killed in an instant.

“Boom!”

The scorching light in the space exploded. Yan Ruoxue broke Hua Qianjie’s domain, causing her to vomit blood and fall..
