Chapter 1577: Chapter 1,577. I hope you can keep your word Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The Aura on Qin Yu’s body made the old man not dare to say a word. Sweat even began to flow from his forehead.

Fortunately, elder Bai walked over quickly and stood in front of the old man. He smiled and said, “Qin Yu, are you afraid that the master will steal your limelight after curing the Vice Sect Master?”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “Will you be responsible if anything happens to the vice sect master?”

Elder Bai snorted coldly and said, “I will be responsible if anything happens to him!”

“Okay!”Qin Yu took two steps back.

“Everyone heard it. If anything happens to the vice sect master, I will kill him. Everyone should have no objections, right?”Qin Yu asked coldly.

The surrounding people looked at each other. Then, someone took the lead and said, “I agree!”

Qin Yu looked at elder Bai and said, “What About You?”

Elder Bai opened his mouth as if he had no confidence.

He looked at the old man as if he was asking for his opinion.

The old man’s big hand shone and said, “Just agree to them!”

Elder Bai gritted his teeth. He braced himself and said, “What if Master Cures the deputy sect leader?”

“Then I’ll cripple my cultivation and be at your disposal,”Qin Yu said coldly.

......

Elder Bai was delighted and immediately said, “Alright, I’ll do as I say!”

Then, elder Bai looked at master and cupped his hands. “I’ll rely on you.”

The old man said indifferently, “Don’t worry.”

With that, he took out a cauldron and took out the herbs he had prepared and began to refine the pill.

This old man was quite skilled. A red spiritual fire actually appeared on his palm.

However, the way he refined the pill was really unbearable to look at.

Qin Yu looked at the process of him refining the pill and couldn’t help but shake his head.

For Qin Yu, this invisible blood clotting pill could be refined easily. It didn’t take much time at all.

However, this master required a large amount of mental energy and effort, and it also required three to four hours.

Qin Yu was not in a hurry. He found a place to sit down and waited quietly.

“Master, are you sure there’s no problem?”Di Zun asked worriedly.

Qin Yu snorted and said, “His level is not worth mentioning.”

With Qin Yu’s words, Di Zun was relieved.

He stood by Qin Yu’s side and waited quietly.

“By the way, have all the people from the Heavenly Cloud sect been sent out?”Qin Yu asked.

Di zun nodded and said, “I sent people to look for news of Master Jue Wu Yesterday.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said in a low voice, “I hope Jue Wu is okay...”

“Master Jue Wu is so strong. He will be fine,”Di zun comforted him.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything and closed his eyes slightly.

The details of Jue Wu appeared in his mind instantly. He immediately felt extremely uncomfortable and could not help but clench his fists.

“Godly monarch of the northern lands... I will definitely not let you off.”Qin Yu clenched his teeth.

Regardless of whether Jue Wu was alive or dead, Qin Yu would remember this debt.

As time passed, three hours passed in the blink of an eye.

Qin Yu, who was resting with his eyes closed, slowly opened his eyes.

“What? You’re Not Done Yet?”Qin Yu frowned.

“Qin Yu, Don’t disturb the Master!”Elder Bai reminded.

Qin Yu sneered. Looking at the old man’s technique, he felt like laughing.

This technique was probably far inferior to that of the alchemist sage.

After about an hour, the invisible blood clotting pill was finally completed.

He took out the pill from the medicinal cauldron and said smugly, “Alright, the pill is done.”

Elder Bai hurriedly snatched the pill. He couldn’t wait to run in front of the deputy sect leader and said, “Deputy sect leader, take the pill.”

The deputy sect leader opened his mouth with great difficulty and swallowed the pill.

At this moment, everyone became nervous.

They stared at the deputy sect master tightly, afraid that something would happen. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Only Qin Yu and the old man were not worried at all.

“Everyone, don’t worry. The deputy sect master will be fine,”the old man said proudly.

The one who was the most nervous was elder Bai. He stared at the deputy sect master, and cold sweat kept breaking out on his forehead.

A few minutes later, the deputy sect master’s internal Qi suddenly began to stabilize, and the injuries on his body were slowly recovering.

Seeing this scene, elder Bai was immediately overjoyed!

He excitedly looked at Qin Yu and said, “How is it? Qin Yu, you saw it, right? The deputy sect leader’s body is already recovering!”

The other elders could not help but be a little surprised.

This old man actually really cured the deputy sect leader? Was He really a Master?

“How is it? Didn’t you all suspect me? Do you still have anything to say now!”Elder Bai was triumphant and looked like a villain who had achieved success.

However, Qin Yu sneered again and again. This invisible blood clotting pill could indeed restore the body for a short period of time, but it needed to be treated in time in the future. Otherwise, it would aggravate the injury.

“Qin Yu! Shouldn’t you also fulfill your promise?”Elder Bai said with a cold smile.

Di Zun’s face suddenly became a bit ugly. He hurriedly said, “Elder Bai, we are all doing this for the deputy sect leader’s good. Why Are You So Serious?”

Elder Bai glared and said, “What do you mean? Are you planning to go back on your word?”

“I...”

“Of course I won’t go back on my word,”Qin Yu interrupted Di Zun.

Elder bai sneered, “Then don’t waste time. Pay for your own cultivation.”

Qin Yu glanced at elder Bai and said, “Don’t be anxious. Wait a little longer.”

“Don’t even think about stalling!”Elder Bai sneered.

Qin Yu calculated the time and said, “Wait another five minutes, at most five minutes.”

“What do you mean?”Elder Bai said angrily.

“Nothing much. I believe that you are not in a hurry for these five minutes,”Qin Yu said.

Then, he closed his eyes again.

Elder bai said unhappily, “Hehe, it seems that you are afraid. Well, then I will wait for you for five minutes. I hope you can fulfill your promise in five minutes.”

At this moment, the many elders in the hall were also at a loss.

“Elder Bai, it’s better to forget it. Mr. Qin is also doing this for the deputy sect leader’s sake.”

“That’s right. What if you really force Mr. Qin into a corner and he goes on a killing spree?”

“That’s right. Elder Bai, it’s better to forget it.”

Elder bai sneered, “Absolutely impossible! As a man, you have to keep your word!”

“Yes, you’re right. I hope you can be so tough later,”Qin Yu sneered.

Elder bai sneered, “Hehe, I always keep my word. I’m not like some people.”

Qin Yu glanced at the deputy sect leader and said in a low voice, “It’s about time. It’s time.”

“Time for what?”Someone asked.

Before Qin Yu could answer, the deputy sect leader who was lying on the bed suddenly vomited blood. His internal Qi also began to wither!

His body, which was slowly recovering, was being torn apart at an extremely fast speed! It looked terrible!
