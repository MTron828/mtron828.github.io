Chapter 1038: Chapter One Thousand and thirty-eight, the intention to pluck the stars

The conversation between the two of them could not help but cause the crowd to be even more shocked!

Such a large scale battle was actually not Qin Yu’s true strength?

Could it be that he was not at the early-stage of the martial saint?

As they spoke, the internal Qi on Qin Yu’s body began to rise rapidly! His body was quickly dyed a golden color!

The surrounding temperature also rose, and even the traces of blood on Qin Yu’s body were quickly evaporated!

With Qin Yu as the center, streams of dragon-like internal Qi spread out in all directions.

Tens of thousands of great dao lingered around Qin Yu’s body.

When he felt the torrential flames erupting from Qin Yu’s body, even Zhai Xing’s expression changed slightly.

He had long guessed that Qin Yu’s strength was beyond his imagination, but he did not expect him to be this powerful!

“It is said that the chaotic body is only at the powerful stage after the martial saint. Now it seems that it is true,”Zhai Xing said in a low voice.

Qin Yu was slightly surprised, “There is such a saying?”

“As a chaotic body, don’t you know?”Zhai Xing said with a frown.

Qin Yu said with a bitter smile, “I don’t have a master, who will tell me these things? Why Don’t you and I stop fighting and make peace, and you can tell me about it?”

“Stop dreaming, let’s end this quickly,”Zhai Xing said coldly.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Even so, do you still want to fight with me? Why do you have to protect the GU family? What benefits did the Gu family give you?”

“Cut the crap!”

Zhai Xing interrupted Qin Yu’s words with an angry roar and then shot over!

Qin Yu did not fight back. He just kept dodging with his agile movement technique. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Zhai Xing, stop. I don’t want to kill you,”Qin Yu said as he retreated.

“Kid, don’t look down on me!”Zhai Xing roared and a fluorescent light rapidly condensed on his palm!

Although this fluorescent light could not compare to the star picking hand, its speed was extremely fast, and in the blink of an eye, it condensed to 1

“Boom!”

Zhai Xing extended his palm, and several fluorescent lights directly stuck onto Qin Yu’s body and exploded!

Such a terrifying power, even Qin Yu could not withstand it.

He was directly sent flying, and a large crater was created on the ground!

Zhai Xing seized the opportunity to pursue, and his palm exploded with a destructive brilliance, blasting towards Qin Yu!

Under such a scale of attack, the entire ground began to collapse!

The residual power that was emitted from it even shattered Xu Huaigu’s protective barrier!

“Retreat!”Jiang he said in a deep voice.

The numerous martial artists did not dare to be negligent and all shot backward!

Zhai Xing looked coldly in the direction of Qin Yu, his eyes slightly narrowed.

He knew that this attack could not kill Qin Yu at all.

“Whoosh!”

Very soon, Qin Yu shot out explosively.

His long hair fell to his shoulders, his clothes were tattered, and there were traces of internal Qi on his body. However, his aura was terrifyingly strong!

“If you don’t make a move now, you won’t be able to make it in time,”Zhai Xing said coldly.

He raised both his hands, and stars-like rays of light began to condense between his fingers!

This was Zhai Xing’s famous ultimate skill, the star picking hand!

The power of the star Seizer was extremely terrifying. Even the white bones of the sky blood rainbow could not withstand it!

Qin Yu was also fully aware of the power of this technique. He adjusted his internal QI, but his expression was still calm, and even a little excited!

“Star Seizer!”

Accompanied by Star Seizer’s furious roar, the ten stars-like rays of light swept towards Qin Yu!

The brilliance drowned the world and shook the world!

Those stars seemed to be about to collapse the heavens and the earth completely collapsed!

Qin Yu’s face was blown by the internal qi and almost distorted. However, his body forcefully endured this power and stood on the spot without moving at all!

“TSK TSK, this kid is actually so strong.”

In the dark, the mustached man had unknowingly come to watch the battle. He was hugging a big tree like a monkey.

“I don’t know how many martial saints have died at the hands of the star-seizing hand. It is said that not many people of the same level can withstand the star-seizing hand,”Jiang he said in a low voice.

“Yes.”Although Xu Huaigu did not speak much, his expression was horrifyingly ugly!

Qin Yu looked at the ten stars that were shooting towards him. His hands began to move as if he was going to use some kind of spell!

“Seven grief void Palm!”

Qin Yu roared loudly, and his hands formed a huge palm print!

This palm print was instantly sent out, and it met the ten stars!

“Boom!”

This was an unprecedented collision, and the entire ground seemed to be overturned, and Wisps of divine might quickly spread out!

Who knew how many people suffered because of this, and they were shaken until they vomited blood continuously!

The handlebar mustache that was holding onto the big tree and watching was blown away along with the tree branches!

“Qin Yu, Your Grandpa!”The handlebar mustache could not help but curse!

On the battlefield, the palm print was actually penetrated and continued to roll over!

Qin Yu waved his hand and another palm strike!

Seven Grief Void Palm, a total of seven palm strikes!

The second palm strike shattered a star!

The third palm strike, the nine star lights seemed to be unable to withstand it and began to shatter!

The fourth palm strike instantly absorbed the star lights and turned to strike at Zhai Xing!

The fifth palm followed, and two palm prints ruthlessly struck Zhai Xing’s body!

“Pu!”

Zhai Xing was instantly struck back repeatedly, vomiting blood non-stop!

Qin Yu raised both hands, but did not rush to strike out the remaining two palms.

He still held a trace of hope in the bottom of his heart, hoping that Zhai Xing would fall down and not stand up again.

But unfortunately, the stubborn Zhai Xing forced himself to stand up! He even planned to use the star picking hand a second time!

Qin Yu could not help but fly into a rage. He immediately struck out with his sixth palm!

With this palm strike, Zhai Xing’s body began to shatter, turning into a bloody mess!

His body shot up explosively. Blood dyed the sky, and then he fell to the ground!

Qin Yu’s brows were tightly knitted. He strode forward and said in a low voice, “Don’t stand up again.”

“As long as I’m not dead, I’ll definitely fight you to the end!”Zhai Xing staggered up and walked in front of Qin Yu again.

Qin Yu could not help but feel a little angry.

He shouted, “What on Earth do you want? Do you really want me to kill you? !”

Zhai Xing did not answer this question. He took a deep breath and then raised his head and roared, “Today, I brought the Soul Bell. I will definitely kill you!”

“Once the soul bell is activated, humans and animals will be indistinguishable. Qin Yu, you’re dead for sure!”

Zhai Xing’s voice was extremely loud, causing Qin Yu’s ears to hurt.

The people watching from afar naturally heard this as well.

“Not good, this Zhai Xing has gone crazy! He actually wants to activate the Soul Bell!”

“Hurry up and run! Otherwise, I’m afraid he’ll die here!”

“Soul Bell?”The handlebar mustache stroked his chin, and a trace of greed flashed in his eyes.

As for Jiang he, who had been watching the battle, his expression didn’t look too good.

He seemed to understand the intention of picking stars.
