Chapter 384: No Need For Approval! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Seeing everyone’s eager attitude, the Pavilion Master seemed to be moved.

“Law Enforcement Elders and protectors, stay behind to guard the place.” A moment later, the Pavilion Master said nonchalantly.

When everyone heard this, they were immediately overjoyed.

“Many thanks, Lord Pavilion Master!” A deafening sound rang out in the courtyard.

Following that, the Pavilion Master didn’t waste any more time and turned around to walk out of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

Dozens of alchemists followed closely behind. Such a thing had never happened before.

Qiao Wu, who was hiding in the dark, was also shocked by this scene.

“Where are they going?” Qiao Wu frowned and asked. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Who knows.”

Qiao Wu thought for a while and said in a deep voice, “Follow them and take a look.”

The three of them quickly followed behind the crowd.

The cultivation technique that the Pavilion Master mentioned was obtained in Qinghe town.

Qinghe town had a lot of mountain rocks, and strange peaks and steep ridges could be seen everywhere.

Many places weren’t even opened to traffic. As they walked, it was as if they had gone back in time.

Very soon, the group arrived at the foot of a huge mountain.

What was surprising was that there was a huge stone staircase in front of this huge mountain!

The entire stone staircase was uncannily crafted and towered straight into the clouds!

On top of the stone staircase, there was actually a huge hand!

Such a scene was extremely shocking!

When one approached the stone staircase, one could feel a strong and imposing aura, making one unable to resist the urge to worship it.

Those who were relatively weaker immediately bowed and kowtowed. Even Qin Yu felt a trace of discomfort.

It was as if his entire body and divine sense were about to be sucked into the stone stairs.

The Pavilion Master pointed at the big hand above and said, “The cultivation technique is up there. As long as you can climb up, you will be able to obtain the cultivation technique.”

“Is it that simple?” Qin Yu was a little surprised.

The Pavilion Master glanced at Qin Yu and said indifferently, “Carelessness can easily result in death.”

Qin Yu stuck out his tongue and said with an embarrassed smile. “I was reckless.”

In the dark, Qiao Wu and the others also saw this scene.

“Hahaha, Qin Yu actually wants to climb the stairway to heaven! This kid is probably crazy!” Qiao Wu couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

The people around him also sneered and said, “Since ancient times, the number of people who were able to climb the stairway to heaven can be counted with one’s fingers, but the number of people who died is countless.”

“Yeah.” Qiao Wu couldn’t help but sigh.

“Back then, even Ye Qing didn’t dare to climb the stairway to heaven. Jiang He, who is as famous as Ye Qing, tried to climb it, but he almost died there.”

“Although he survived by luck, he hasn’t appeared in more than ten years. Could it be that Qin Yu thinks he is better than Ye Qing and Jiang He?”

The person beside Qiao Wu sneered. “This has nothing to do with strength. Rumor has it that only the chosen one can climb the stairway to heaven.”

“That’s right.” The other person also nodded.

“The chosen one can climb up very easily, but if it’s not the person chosen by the stairway, it will be extremely painful.”

Qiao Wu nodded slightly. He put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Looks like we can go back early to report.”

...

Under the stairway, Qin Yu didn’t step up the stairway for a long time.

“Don’t have too much psychological pressure,” the Pavilion Master said from the side.

“If you are accepted by the stairway to heaven, you won’t be subjected to any restrictions or pressure.”

“But if you aren’t, you will be subjected to tremendous force at the second level.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “In other words, the second level will determine whether I have the qualifications to climb up.”

“That’s right.” The Pavilion Master nodded slightly.

“I understand.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

He didn’t waste any more time. He immediately adjusted his state of mind and stepped onto the stairway to heaven.

The moment he stepped onto the stairway to heaven, Qin Yu’s heart seemed to have been jolted by something!

It was as if someone was holding a hammer and ruthlessly striking Qin Yu’s heart!

This made Qin Yu secretly feel troubled.

Could it be that... he wasn’t recognized by the stairway to heaven?

Then, Qin Yu lifted his foot and stepped towards the second level!

Everyone watched this scene nervously. Even the Pavilion Master narrowed her eyes slightly.

Because everyone would know whether Qin Yu was the chosen one or not! Whether he was recognized by the stairway to heaven!

Finally, Qin Yu’s foot landed on the second level.

“Ah!!!” The moment he stepped on it, Qin Yu’s entire body seemed to be torn apart by a large hand!

The moment he touched it, blood oozed out from all the pores on his body!

His head felt as though it had been struck by lightning. The world in front of him turned dark, and the world was spinning!

“How could this be...” Yao Qing couldn’t help but mutter softly.

“Could it be... Qin Yu isn’t the chosen one?” The Fifth Elder’s expression was also somewhat ugly.

The Pavilion Master shook her head slightly and said, “Looks like he hasn’t obtained the approval of the stairway to heaven. We can leave now.”

In the dark, Qiao Wu and the others couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“This kid is indeed not the chosen one. Hahaha!” Qiao Wu laughed maniacally.

“This second level of the stairway to heaven will cause him huge injury.”

“We can leave now. There’s no need to continue watching.”

Just as everyone was feeling disappointed, Qin Yu stood up from the stairway to heaven with great difficulty!

He was covered in blood and his body was trembling non-stop.

However, Qin Yu had no intention of giving up!

Amidst this pain, Qin Yu raised his foot with great difficulty and stepped on the third level of the stairway!

“Huh?” Qiao Wu, who was hiding in the dark, couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows.

“This kid wants to forcefully climb the stairway?”

“Haha, interesting. According to what I know, Jiang He did the same back then, but he couldn’t hold on after he climbed to the thirteenth level.”

“I guess that he can only climb to the fifth level at most.”

The few of them, their eyes filled with a hint of playfulness, discussed animatedly.

Under the stairway to heaven, the Pavilion Master frowned slightly and a hint of uneasiness flashed in her eyes.

“Qin Yu, forcefully climbing the stairway to heaven is pointless. Even if you are lucky enough to climb a few levels, you will eventually fall down,” the Pavilion Master said coldly.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He gritted his teeth. No matter how much pain he suffered, he still had no intention of retreating!

“So what if I don’t get approved...” Qin Yu gritted his teeth and raised his foot again!

“I don’t need the approval of the stairway to heaven. I only need my own approval!” Qin Yu roared furiously and the energy in his entire body suddenly erupted!

He relied on the strength of his own body to resist the power of the stairway to heaven!

Finally, Qin Yu stepped onto the fourth level!

The pain on the fourth level was dozens of times more than that on the third level!

Qin Yu felt as if his divine sense was about to be stripped off! The sound of bones cracking could be heard, as if they were about to break!

“Qin Yu! Come down quickly!” The Fifth Elder shouted anxiously.

However, Qin Yu didn’t care. He grabbed onto the fifth level tightly and climbed up with difficulty!

Crack!

The moment he stepped onto the fifth level, all ten of Qin Yu’s fingers were broken! The world in front of his eyes was spinning, and he couldn’t even stand steadily!

“Ah!!” Qin Yu roared repeatedly. He used all his strength and lifted his foot to step onto the sixth level!

The moment he stepped onto the sixth level, Qin Yu’s calf also exploded with a bang!

“Qin Yu! Come down quickly!” The people who were watching from below roared one after another.

Even the Pavilion Master couldn’t bear to see this heartbreaking scene.
