1755 Xiao Sheng? Xiao Hai?

Qin Yu’s huge body fell to the ground with a loud crash, stirring up clouds of dust.

Yuan Xiu could not help but sneer.

“Qin Yu!” Wen Wanchong’s expression was extremely ugly. He wanted to help, but he couldn’t even stand up.

“Just a maggot.” Yuan Xiu said coldly.

Qin Yu, who was lying on the ground, was losing his strength rapidly.

But in Qin Yu’s mind, images of the past kept flashing.

The promises he had made, his past ambitions, and the dreams in his heart were all encouraging him.

“Ah!”

Qin Yu let out an angry roar, and the golden light flickered again!

He endured the powerlessness of his body and climbed up step by step!

However, before he could make a move, Yuan Xiu slapped Qin Yu again!

This time, Yuan Xiu raised his foot and stepped on his body.

The huge force made it difficult for Qin Yu to get up.

The aura on his body was circulating, and the golden light would light up and extinguish at times.

However, Qin Yu was still unwilling to give up. He knew that if he gave up today, he would be doomed eternally.

All his efforts would be in vain. Everything would be for naught.

“No, no!”

Qin Yu was not willing to give up. With both hands on the ground, he tried his best to resist the powerful force!

Yuan Xiu looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Putting up a stubborn resistance, your spirit is worthy of admiration. Unfortunately, your strength does not allow it.”

“Boom!”

After saying that, Yuan Xiu stomped on Qin Yu again!

Waves of power burst forth.

The powerful force crushed Qin Yu’s body into pieces!

In this world, Yuan Xiu seemed to be the master. No one seemed to be able to resist him!

Qin Yu was stepped on again and again. His body was about to be crushed, and his bones were broken one by one.

A sense of powerlessness filled Qin Yu’s entire body. Under the huge gap in strength, everything seemed to be useless.

“No, no...”

Qin Yu didn’t want to give up, and his eyes were a little wet.

It wasn’t because of the pain, but because of despair. It was because all the hard work he had put in for so long was going to go to waste.

“Alright, you can die now.” Yuan Xiu’s expression gradually turned cold.

He glanced at the few people present and murmured, as if he was going to give an ultimatum.

Immediately, Yuan Xiu lifted the terrifying radiance with his palm again.

He was going to destroy this small world and make Qin Yu and the others disappear from this world completely!

“Go to hell!”

Yuan Xiu’s face was filled with madness as he smashed his fist forward with all his might!

However, at this moment, a ray of light suddenly appeared in this dark world!

The light was like a piece of cloth that had been torn apart, cooling the entire darkness!

“Slash!”

A sword blade tore this world apart.

The darkness began to collapse, and light slowly appeared!

The moment the darkness was torn apart, the small world began to collapse!

Yuan Xiu’s face darkened.

This time, he didn’t even have the desire to see who did it.

This was because his plans had been interrupted at the crucial moment time and time again.

The anger almost caused Yuan Xiu to collapse.

“Who is it? Who is it?”

Finally, Yuan Xiu could not take it anymore. He roared and turned around to look at the moment the world collapsed!

On the other side of this small world, there was a tall man.

He didn’t have a sword in his hand, only a pair of rough, callused hands.

When they saw who it was, they were all shocked!

“Xiao Sheng, you’ve come out of seclusion?” Yuan Xiu was the first to exclaim.

Wen Wanchong and the others were also excited. They stood up and shouted, “He’s finally come out of seclusion. It’s much faster than I imagined!

Qin Yu wiped away the tears that were about to flow out, and the cosmic form slowly disappeared.

He looked at Xiao Sheng in shock and said in a low voice, “Good, good that he finally made it...”

“Something’s wrong!”

Qu Zhu shook his head.

“What’s wrong?” Wen Wanchong frowned.

Qu Zhu lifted a finger and pointed in Xiao Sheng’s direction.

“Xiao Sheng is still sitting there. He hasn’t even come out of his seclusion. Furthermore, he won’t even be able to undergo his tribulation in such a short period of time.” Qu Zhu coldly said.

After Qu Zhu’s reminder, everyone also came back to their senses!

Xiao Sheng was clearly just sitting there, when did he come out of seclusion?

However, the person in front of him was clearly the face of Xiao Sheng!

“Xiao... Xiao Hai!”

Qin Yu suddenly remembered something!

There was only one person who had the same facial features as him, and that was his brother, Xiao Hai!

“Xiao Hai?” Qu Zhu and Wen Wanchong looked at Qin Yu and frowned, “Didn’t Xiao Hai die?”

“I... I don’t know.” Qin Yu shook his head in a hurry.

However, who else had such a face other than Xiao Hai?

Qin Yu couldn’t figure it out. No one could!

“Senior Xiao Hai, is that you?” Qin Yu shouted.

The tall man standing on the other side of the small world looked at Qin Yu and said, “Qin Yu, take these people and leave first.”

Hearing his tone, Qin Yu immediately confirmed his thoughts.

This person was Xiao Hai!

“Senior Xiao Hai, you... You didn’t die!” Qin Yu was so excited that he didn’t even know what to say to express his feelings at the moment!

“Quickly step aside, we’ll talk about the rest later,” Xiao Hai said in a deep voice. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Yes! ” Qin Yu nodded quickly. He, Qu Zhu, and the others all rushed into the distance.

“That’s weird. Didn’t Xiao Hai die? Why did he appear again?” Qu Zhu said with a frown after they had run some distance.

Qu Zhu wasn’t the only one. Everyone was thinking about this.

Even Yuan Xiu was frowning.

“Isn’t Xiao Hai already dead?” Yuan Xiu looked at Sima Bei.

“That day, he...” Sima Bei said in a panic. “He was indeed killed by the few of us. I... I don’t know what’s going on either...”

“Trash.” Yuan Xiu could not help but say coldly.

Then, Yuan Xiu looked at Xiao Hai and said, “But it’s good that he’s alive. I’d like to meet the person who crossed the dead river.”

Xiao Hai looked at Yuan Xiu coldly and said, “It’s a pity that I didn’t kill you that day.”

Yuan Xiu laughed heartily. “Xiao Hai, you’re indeed impressive. You crossed the dead river by force, endured the immense pressure from the North Plain, and almost killed four of my Godly Kings. Such a battle record is unprecedented and will attract worldwide attention!

“I’m very curious, how did you do it?” Yuan Xiu raised his eyebrows.

Xiao Hai looked at Yuan Xiu coldly and said, “You want to know?”

“That’s right, I really want to know. How did you do it? A technique? Inheritance? Or is it a supreme magical artifact?” Yuan Xiu guessed.
