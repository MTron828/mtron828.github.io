Chapter 1492: Chapter 1,492, comprehension of spells 1

In the current Tianyun sect, the first elder was the only one who had the final say.

The cultivation mountain was shrouded in dense fog, and no one could rush up. No one could see the sect master, so they could only listen to the first elder.

The first elder narrowed his eyes and sneered, “I hope Qin Yu can lose to Hua Zi, so we don’t have to make a move...”

“First Elder, are you really going to set up a trap in the Dark?”The deputy sect master asked with a frown.

First Elder glanced at him and said coldly, “What, do you have a problem with that?”

“I don’t dare.”Although the deputy sect master was displeased, he didn’t dare to admit it.

First Elder snorted coldly and then began to arrange people.

The top-notch martial artist of the Tianyun sect was endless. Under the arrangement of First Elder, they decided to hide in the void and find a suitable opportunity to make a move.

“You must hide your identity. No one can know that it was done by the Heavenly Cloud Sect,”said the first elder in a deep voice.

After thinking about it, the first elder decided to let them wear black robes and dress up as northerners.

At this time, no one would doubt them.

...

At this time, Qin Yu was still absorbing the nascent soul pills at a leisurely pace.

As for the last ten pills, Qin Yu still stuffed them into his mouth. Then, he circulated the meridian circulation technique and slowly circulated them in his body.

There was only one day left before the fight with Huazi.

On this day, Wen Da and Wen er sneaked into the cultivation room.

The two of them looked at Qin Yu, who was cultivating in seclusion, and whispered, “This kid is really ruthless. He doesn’t find it boring to sit there every day.”

“Exactly, exactly. Is it not satisfying to drink and pick up a girl at this time?”Wen Er also said in a weird way.

“What are you two doing here? Why? Do you want to cultivate with us too?”

At this time, Jue Wu also came to the cultivation room.

The two of them smiled and said, “Aunt Jue Wu, look at what you said. We don’t have the ability to do that.”

Jue Wu rolled her eyes and said, “Then don’t Disturb Qin Yu. If he doesn’t come out of seclusion tomorrow, it will be embarrassing.”

“No, we won’t disturb him. We’ll just watch here!”Wen Da saluted.

Wen er whispered, “Aunt Jue Wu, there’s only one day left. Is there still time?”

“Yes, that Hua Zi is Yongji’s disciple. I always feel that Yongji arranged this on purpose,”Wen da said in a deep voice.

Jue Wu looked at Wen Da in surprise and said, “You’re quite smart.”

“Look at what you said. I just don’t like cultivation. In fact, I’m very smart,”said Wen da smugly.

Jue Wu stroked her chin with her small hand and said in a low voice, “In fact, I also suspect it, but I can’t say it without evidence. I’m afraid this Yongji is going to do something big in the near future.”

The invasion of the northern land undoubtedly gave Yongji a chance.

In the entire southern region, besides the Tianyun sect, Yongji had almost no opponents.

Xiao Hai was at the border. Qu Zhu, Jue Wu, and the others were not interested in the status of the southern region at all. Only Yongji, who was secretly developing, could turn against them at any time.

“Master Jue Wu.”

At this moment, two small disciples walked over from Mount Hua Ning.

Jue Wu looked at the two of them and said, “How is it?”

The two of them said in a deep voice, “According to our understanding, hua zi has been in seclusion with Yong Ji for the past few days. I’m afraid that he is teaching some moves.”

Jue Wu’s expression immediately darkened.

She looked at Qin Yu, who had his eyes closed, and said in a low voice, “It seems that I have to teach this kid two moves too. I don’t know if I can make it in time.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Aiya, let’s not care about that. Let’s go have a drink,”Big Wen pulled Jue Wu and said.

Absolute dance shook her head and said, “You guys go ahead. I’ll stay here and guard Qin Yu.”

Time was tight, and absolute dance didn’t dare to delay.

Big Wen and Big Wen didn’t insist and tactfully walked away.

Time passed by minute by minute. Absolute dance stood there and waited.

For absolute dance, who almost had ADHD, this was undoubtedly an extremely painful thing.

She closed her eyes slightly and adjusted her breathing, but in the end, she could not hold it in any longer.

“This is too boring!”Jue Wu cursed in her heart.

She sized up Qin Yu and muttered softly, “This kid shouldn’t be able to come out of seclusion for a while. Go drink some wine first and come back later.”

With that, Jue Wu ran away.

Not long after Jue Wu left, Qin Yu, who was sitting in the cultivation room, opened his mouth and let out a turbid qi.

In an instant, his body was wrapped in golden light, which was extremely dazzling in the darkness.

The moment he opened his eyes, a ray of light shot out!

The surrounding internal Qi swept out at this moment, like a gentle breeze that blew through the bamboo forest.

Qin Yu slowly stood up. He gently clenched his fist and felt the power in his body.

“A hundred nascent soul pills... I can’t believe they didn’t allow me to step into the mighty realm.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little regretful.

For a special constitution like his, the balance of yin and yang was extremely important.

A large amount of spiritual Qi brought very little improvement, so it was normal for him to not be able to step into the mighty realm.

“Although I wasn’t able to step into the mighty realm, my spiritual power has already recovered to its peak state. Killing that Hua Zi shouldn’t be a problem,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Although Hua Zi was Yongji’s disciple and ultimately had a myriad of techniques, behind Qin Yu was the Dao Guardian.

Yongji’s strength was nothing in front of the Guardian.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh coldly.

If he was going to throw a punch, he might as well take this opportunity to show off.

...

In the pavilion.

Jue Wu was getting more and more excited as he drank. He had long forgotten about Qin Yu.

“Come, come, come. You lost again. Hurry up and fill me up!”Jue Wu said excitedly.

At this moment, Qin Yu walked over from not far away.

After seeing Qin Yu, Jue Wu waved his hand and said, “Come and have a drink with me!”

Seeing this, Qin Yu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

Wen Da, who was at the side, also reminded in a low voice, “Aunt Jue Wu, aren’t you going to teach Qin Yu a spell?”

Jue Wu was stunned. She patted her head hard and muttered, “Oh no, I forgot about the serious matter.”

Then, Jue Wu stood up and pulled Qin Yu, “Let’s go. Follow me to the cultivation room.”

Qin Yu said in surprise, “Why are we going to the Cultivation Room?”

Jue Wu whispered, “I heard that Yong Ji has been teaching Huazi techniques. I have to teach you two moves too.”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No need. I can kill him easily.”

Jue Wu glared and said, “That won’t do. You must use my spell to defeat him. Do you understand?”

Qin Yu was at a loss, as if he didn’t understand.

Jue Wu whispered, “The battle between you and Huazi has already spread like wildfire. Everyone knows about your relationship with me, and they also know that Huazi is Yongji’s foster son. Therefore, the battle between the two of you, in the eyes of the outside world, is equivalent to a fight between me and Yongji.”

At this point, Jue Wu’s eyes widened as she said, “You have to defeat him. I will teach you my trump card technique. As for whether you can comprehend it or not, that will depend on yourself.”
