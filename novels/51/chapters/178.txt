This stone, weighing at least 500 lbs, was extremely huge. It was extremely eye-catching.

Qin Yu patted the stone and was about to speak when Wei Jiang ran forward and said, “Qin Yu, such a huge stone will cost a lot of money.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “It’s fine, as long as something is inside.”

Seeing this, Wei Jiang suggested, “Let Mr. Qiu take a look for you.”

“Uh... There’s no need for that, right?” Qin Yu frowned and said.

He could feel the spiritual energy in the raw stone, so there was no need for Qiu Feng to take a look.

However, Qin Yu couldn’t refuse Wei Jiang, so Qin Yu could only agree.

Then, Wei Jiang brought Qiu Feng to Qin Yu.

“Mr. Qiu, what do you think of this raw stone?” Wei Jiang asked.

Qiu Feng walked forward and walked around in front of the raw stone.

Then, he put his hand on the raw stone and started to fumble.

A few minutes later, Qiu Feng shook his head and said, “This is a piece of trash. I don’t suggest you buy it.”

“Qin Yu, do you hear me? Don’t buy it,” Wei Jiang said quickly.

Qin Yu said politely, “Mr. Qiu, I like this raw stone very much. I think there must be something I want inside.”

Qiu Feng sneered. “You newbies don’t know anything, yet still like to buy big ones. The merchants are scamming people like you!”

Qin Yu didn’t mind. He smiled and didn’t say anything back.

“Please help me cut this raw stone,” Qin Yu shouted in the direction of the staff.

Soon, a man with a badge came to Qin Yu.

“Sir, the price of this raw stone is 32 million. Are you sure you want to cut it open?” The staff said.

“32 million?” Wei Jiang couldn’t help but change his expression.

He hurriedly said, “Qin Yu, I know you aren’t short of money now, but money shouldn’t be spent like this! Whether something comes out or not, it will be hard for you to earn it back!”

“Moreover, Mr. Qiu said that this is a piece of waste!”

Qin Yu stubbornly said, “Mr. Wei, don’t worry. I know what to do.”

“Kid, I advise you not to buy this raw stone.” Qiu Feng said with a cold expression.

Qin Yu apologized again, “Mr. Qiu, it’s not that I don’t believe you, but I really like this raw stone too much.”

Hearing this, Qiu Feng immediately scolded, “You just don’t trust me! Wei Jiang, if your friend is this stubborn, then don’t blame me for turning hostile!”

Qiu Feng’s reaction made Qin Yu frown.

Qiu Feng... seemed a little strange.

Even if Qin Yu didn’t believe him, he shouldn’t have such a big reaction. After all, he didn’t need to pay for this raw stone.

“Qin Yu, Mr. Qiu is also doing this for your own good. Don’t buy it!” Wei Jiang said anxiously.

Qin Yu didn’t pay attention to him. He quietly released his spiritual sense and covered Qiu Feng.

After a short moment of contact, Qin Yu’s expression changed.

Qiu Feng... Seemed to have an extremely demonic internal qi.

This person was definitely not an ordinary person!

“Just cut this piece,” Qin Yu said firmly.

Then, Qin Yu took out his bank card and handed it to the staff.

Qiu Feng’s expression was a bit cold as he said coldly, “Kid, this raw stone will never turn green. It’s not too late for you to give up now!”

Qin Yu raised his brows and said with a nonchalant smile, “Mr. Qiu, don’t tell me you want this raw stone.”

Qiu Feng’s expression changed and he immediately scolded, “What nonsense are you talking about! Wei Jiang, is this your friend?”

Wei Jiang quickly apologized, “Mr. Qiu, I’m really sorry. Qin Yu... He’s joking.”

After saying that, Wei Jiang gave Qin Yu a look to tell him to keep quiet.

However, Qin Yu sneered and said, “Mr. Qiu, I want this raw stone.”

Not long after, the staff came back.

He politely said to Qin Yu, “Sorry, the raw stone is too big. We need professional tools. Please wait a moment.”

“No need.” Qin Yu shook his head.

His fist condensed spiritual energy, and then he smashed the raw stone fiercely!

“Boom!” The raw stone was instantly shattered!

The people around looked dumbfounded.

He shattered a stone with one punch? Was this a movie?

“Who is this kid? He actually has such power?!”

“He seems to be Qin Yu!”

“Is he the Qin Yu who beat Young Master Jiang into a vegetable?”

At the mention of this name, the faces of the people around suddenly turned pale!

Afraid that they would be mistaken as Qin Yu’s companion, countless people hurriedly retreated to the side.

Qin Yu ignored them. He only stared at the raw stone coldly.

The raw stone shattered, bringing up waves of dust.

Everyone’s gaze was fixed on the raw stone.

As the dust slowly fell, they saw a green sword lying quietly in the ruins.

“There really is something!” Qin Yu’s eyes lit up. He hurriedly walked forward and grabbed the sword!

The moment he grabbed it, Qin Yu felt the spiritual energy in the sword resonate with the spiritual energy in his body!

At this moment, the sword seemed to have become Qin Yu’s right-hand man!

A sense of familiarity rushed over!

“This definitely isn’t an ordinary sword!” Qin Yu waved it to the side gently, and a loud crash immediately sounded!

The huge rock not far away was cut into two halves!

Most importantly, Qin Yu didn’t activate his spiritual power at all! It was purely the power of this sword!

“It really is a treasure!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little excited! Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Meanwhile, Qiu Feng, who was far away, had a cold expression on his face, and a murderous look flashed in his eyes.

“What kind of sword is this? Does anyone want to appraise it?”

“It’s probably an antique. Qin Yu is really lucky!”

“What’s the use of being lucky? His days are numbered after offending the Jiang Family.”

Even Wei Jiang and Wei Ming were dumbstruck.

“Qin Yu, I didn’t expect you to know how to bet on stones!” Wei Jiang said with a stunned expression.

Qin Yu smiled and didn’t say anything.

He put away the sword and said with a smile, “Mr. Qiu, it seems that what you said might not be right.”

Qiu Feng snickered and said, “Although this sword isn’t bad, it might not be a good thing for you.”

Qin Yu said with a smile, “If someone wants to kill me to steal it, I will wait for him.”

Qiu Feng snorted lightly and didn’t say anything more.

Wei Jiang was confused. He frowned and said, “Qin Yu, what does he mean?”

Qin Yu glanced at Wei Jiang and said, “Mr. Wei, what is the relationship between Qiu Feng and you? Are you two really friends?”

Wei Jiang nodded and said, “Yes, we have known each other for many years. What’s wrong?”

Qin Yu frowned and whispered, “That shouldn’t be...”

“What’s wrong?” Wei Jiang asked in puzzlement.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, then said, “Mr. Wei, Qiu Feng wants to kill me.”

Wei Jiang froze, then smiled and said, “Qin Yu, what are you talking about? Qiu Feng and I have known each other for many years, and he wouldn’t even dare to kill a chicken. How could he want to kill you?”
