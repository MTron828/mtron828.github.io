Chapter 1286: Chapter 1286, Ling Yun’s plan 

At this moment, Ling Yun and the three almighty experts beside him were sitting around a ball of fire, eating the wild beasts that had just attacked.

“If it really can’t be done, we can only go to Qingyan forest and wait for Qin Yu,”someone said.

“That’s right, as long as we don’t clash with them directly. We Aren’t willing to shed all pretense of cordiality with the hunter organization, and they also don’t dare to shed all pretense of cordiality with our Tianyun sect,”another person added.

Ling Yun, who had been silent all this while, let out a cold smile at this moment.

“Why Bother?”Ling Yun snickered.

He held a fire stick in his hand as he knocked on the ground while laughing coldly.

“Young Master Ling, do you have any good ideas?”Someone asked.

Ling Yun replied calmly, “It’s true that we can’t start a war with the hunter organization, but that doesn’t mean that the team leader can’t be replaced.”

The few people around him turned pale with fright when they heard this.

“Young master, what do you mean?”Some of the higher-ups didn’t understand and waited for Ling Yun to continue.

Ling Yun said calmly, “The hunter organization is so huge. There are bound to be people who are dissatisfied with that team leader.”

“Furthermore, that team leader is rigid in his actions. I’m afraid that he has already offended someone in secret.”

“As long as we increase our profits and get rid of that team leader, wouldn’t it be enough to replace him with an obedient team leader?”

The few people present couldn’t help but look at each other in dismay. They seemed to be extremely shocked by Ling Yun’s bold idea.

“I think the kid who brought us to find Qin Yu today is already pretty good,”Ling Yun said with a faint smile.

“You guys think of a way to find him.”

The person that Ling Yun was referring to was Zhong Wu.

His judgment was extremely accurate. In today’s short encounter, he had already seen through Zhong Wu’s face. It was the most suitable person to find him.

“Young master, this matter is no small matter. Shouldn’t we consider it carefully before making a decision?”Someone suggested.

Ling Yun said arrogantly, “Cut the crap. Just do what I tell you to do!”

“Alright, Young Master, we’ll do it right away!”

The few of them stood up slowly and rushed towards the hunter organization.

Hunter organization.

Zhong Wu was lying on the bed, tossing and turning, unable to fall asleep.

The moment he thought of Qin Yu, he was filled with anger.

When he remembered that Qin Yu had cheated him of more than a million yuan, he gnashed his teeth in hatred.

“Damn it!”Zhong Wu sat up from the bed, completely unable to fall asleep.

He pushed open the door and took advantage of the night to go look for Jin Lun.

However, he had only walked for a short distance when three figures blocked his way.

“Who are you? What are you doing?”Zhong Wu said in a bad mood.

As soon as he finished speaking, Zhong Wu reacted.

Weren’t these three people from the Tianyun sect during the day?

Zhong Wu’s expression suddenly changed. He said with some fear, “Big Brothers, I don’t know that Qin Yu at all. I’m not familiar with him. Don’t look for me...”

“Cut the crap, our young master wants to see you,”the three of them said coldly.

Without waiting for Zhong Wu’s reply, they grabbed Zhong Wu and sped away.

Along the way, Zhong Wu was terrified. He thought that these people were going to take his life.

A few minutes later, the few of them arrived in front of Ling Yun.

“Young master, they’re here.”

Ling Yun nodded slightly. He glanced at Zhong Wu and gestured for him to come over and sit down.

Zhong Wu scrambled over to Ling Yun, he smiled sheepishly. “Young Master Ling, that Qin Yu has nothing to do with me. I thought he was from the Tianyun sect, but I didn’t expect him to be a liar! I didn’t expect him to be the enemy of the Tianyun sect!”

Ling Yun said plainly, “It seems like you know my Tianyun sect very well.”

Zhong wu hurriedly replied, “Of course. Who in the entire South Province doesn’t know that the Tianyun sect is the number one sect?”

Ling Yun stood up slowly. A wisp of scheming that didn’t match his age flashed across his delicate face. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Do you want to be the leader of the Hunter Organization?”Ling Yun asked straightforwardly.

Zhong wu frowned and asked, “What do you mean?”

Ling Yun snorted coldly. “This team leader doesn’t put our Tianyun sect in his eyes at all. He actually dares to oppose our Tianyun sect for the sake of Qin Yu!”

At this point, Ling Yun looked at Zhong wu coldly and said, “So, I would like to change someone who is obedient to become the leader of the Hunter organization. I wonder if you are interested?”

Zhong Wu heard this and waved his hand repeatedly. “Young Master Ling, you think too highly of me. I don’t have that ability.”

Ling Yun frowned and said, “How would you know if you don’t try? As long as you kill the current team leader or take away his holy weapon, you can become the next team leader!”

“No, no, no, Young Master Ling, I don’t have that much ambition. You’ve found the wrong person.”Zhong Wu waved his hand in fear.

This made Ling Yun furious. He glared at Zhong Wu, he gritted his teeth and said, “What a useless piece of trash! Then stop talking nonsense. I want you to think of a way to kill that team leader! If you can’t do it, I’ll kill you!”

Zhong wu said bitterly, “Young master ling, I really don’t have that ability. Moreover, even if he dies, I’m not qualified to be the next team leader...”

Speaking up to this point, Zhong Wu seemed to have suddenly thought of something.

His eyes lit up and he hurriedly said, “Young Master Ling, I can introduce you to someone. He’s definitely suitable!”

“Who?”Ling Yun replied without a hint of annoyance.

“Jin Lun, the Hunter King of our Hunter Organization!”Zhong Wu said in a low voice.

“He has a high reputation in the hunter organization and has many followers. If the team leader dies, he will definitely become the next team leader!”

“Most importantly, he has long been dissatisfied with the current team leader. Recently, he was defeated by Qin Yu. I believe that he will definitely agree to your request!”

Ling Yun and the rest looked at each other as if they were sending a message through their eyes.

“Is what you said true?”Ling Yun narrowed his eyes.

“It’s absolutely true!”Zhong wu patted his chest and said.

A smile appeared on Ling Yun’s face.

He patted Zhong Wu’s shoulder and said, “Alright, I’ll leave this matter to you. Think of a way to bring him to see me.”
