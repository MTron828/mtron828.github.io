1900 Saintess Gu’s Suggestion 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Qin Yu came back to his senses and shook his head. “Of course not. I’m just a little curious. How do we share this thing? Don’t tell me you’re going to split it into halves?”

“It seems like Mr. Qin knows about the Bodhi gem, but you know very little about it,” Saintess Gu said with a smile.

Qin Yu nodded slightly, waiting for Saintess Gu to continue.

“It takes a long time for the Bodhi ancient tree to grow,” Saintess Gu continued. “It takes at least a hundred years for the Bodhi ancient tree to start emitting its Holy Breath. As for the fruit on the tree, I’m afraid it will take even longer.”

!!

Hearing this, Qin Yu was shocked.

This thing actually needed such a long time to raise!

“So, you and I will raise this ancient tree together. In the future, we will share the tree. How about it?” Saintess Gu said.

Qin Yu thought for a while and agreed it was a good idea.

“I agree, but… I can’t figure out where to plant the Bodhi seed,” Qin Yu asked curiously.

“In the Gu family, of course,” Saintess Gu said with a smile.

“The Gu family?” Qin Yu frowned instantly.

Once this thing entered the Gu family, Saintess Gu would turn against him, and there was nothing Qin Yu could do.

Moreover, if it was planted in the Gu family, how would Qin Yu raise it?

Saintess Gu chuckled. She seemed to have noticed Qin Yu’s confusion and said, “What the Gu family has is much more than you can imagine. Furthermore, I’m living alone in one of the Gu family’s Mystic Realms. So there’s no need to worry about the interference of the Gu family.”

Qin Yu was shocked. He looked at Saintess Gu in surprise and said, “You mean to plant this Bodhi ancient tree in the Mystic Realm you’re in?”

“That’s right,” Saintess Gu nodded.

Qin Yu said half-jokingly and half-seriously, “Saintess Gu, aren’t you afraid I’ll do something to you?”

“No, I’m not,” Saintess Gu shook her head.

This made Qin Yu speechless. He thought for a moment, nodded, and said, “Alright. We’ll do as you say!”

Saintess Gu didn’t say anything else. She kept the Bodhi gem and the other treasures in the Spatial Magic Artifact.

“Next, I need Mr. Qin to lead the way out of the sanctum,” Saintess Gu said.

“Of course, no problem,” Qin Yu nodded and said.

Therefore, Qin Yu walked out of the sanctum with Saintess Gu based on his memory.

The two spent a long time and finally left the sanctum without danger.

Outside the sanctum was still packed with people. They looked at the sanctum as if they wanted to see what kind of treasures would come out of it.

However, when they saw Qin Yu and Saintess Gu walking out together, their faces turned very ugly.

“It’s that kid again! He actually walked out with Saintess Gu!”

“What role is this kid playing? And what is his relationship with Saintess Gu?”

“I’m afraid this person has an extraordinary background. Otherwise, how could he gain the favor of Saintess Gu? ”

“Could he be a Holy Son of some aristocratic family that has not disclosed himself? I saw him challenging Yan Yunfan!”

Hearing the crowd’s discussion, Qin Yu was too lazy to explain.

He looked at Saintess Gu and said, “Saintess Gu, I’m afraid there’s one more thing I need your help with.”

Saintess Gu nodded slightly, signaling Qin Yu to continue.

Qin Yu hesitated for a long time, then finally smiled bitterly. “I wonder if Saintess Gu has any way to let me enter the Yan family…”

This was the Gu family’s territory, and only the Gu family, Yan family, and Si family of the nine great aristocratic families had come here. This was enough to show that the Gu family and the Yan family had a good relationship.

Saintess Gu looked at Qin Yu in surprise and said, “Go to the Yan family? Why do you want to go to the Yan family?”

“It’s a long story,” Qin Yu sighed slightly. Of course, he could not tell her the truth.

“Perhaps you should look for Yan Yunfan regarding this matter. After all, he’s the Holy Son of the Yan family. He has more say than I do,” Saintess Gu said with a smile.

Upon hearing this, Qin Yu bowed slightly and said, “I’ve troubled Saintess Gu.”

To see Yan Yunfan? With Yan Yunfan’s character, how could he possibly agree?

Just as Qin Yu turned around and was about to leave, Saintess Gu said, “Mr. Qin, you and I share the Bodhi gem. Don’t you want to go to the Mystic Realm of the Gu family to take a look?”

Qin Yu stopped in his tracks. He turned around to look at Saintess Gu and mumbled, “It seems reasonable.”

Since Saintess Gu occupied a Mystic Realm all by herself, he didn’t have to worry about the Gu family suspecting anything.

Just as the two were talking, the man with the mustache seemed unable to hold back anymore.

He covered his face and ran out from the dark.

“Qin Yu, don’t forget the agreement between us.” The man with the mustache reminded him.

He had a secret technique to cover his face, so he was not afraid of Saintess discovering his identity. Little did he know that Saintess Gu had already known his identity.

Just as the man with the mustache was asking Qin Yu for the treasure, a killing intent came quietly. The smile of the Saintess was filled with cold killing intent.

“Eh? What’s going on? Why did the temperature suddenly drop?” the man with the mustache shrunk his neck and muttered softly.

“Man with the mustache, I’ve been looking for you.” At this moment, the man with the mustache heard Saintess Gu’s voice.

The man with the mustache’s face changed. He instantly felt something not right and turned to escape!

However, Saintess Gu had already sealed the surrounding space. No matter how powerful one was, one could not escape!

“Qin Yu, f*ck you!” the man with the mustache was so angry that he couldn’t help cursing.

Qin Yu hurriedly stood in front of Saintess Gu, cupped his hands, and said, ” Saintess Gu, I don’t know what misunderstanding the two of you have. But…”

...

However, before Qin Yu could finish his sentence, he was forced back by Saintess Gu with a wave of her hand!

She stretched out her palm, and 38,000 silver needles appeared in the void. Each silver needle could pierce through the void and had unlimited power!

“Saintess… Saintess Gu, please listen to my explanation. It’s a misunderstanding. It’s all a misunderstanding…” the man with the mustache smiled embarrassedly and said.

However, Saintess Gu refused to listen to his nonsense. She waved her hand, and the 38,000 silver needles flew in the direction of the man with the mustache!

The terrifying power turned everything in the surroundings into dust, and the void was instantly riddled with holes!

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. He immediately took a step forward, wanting to block in front of the man with the mustache. Unfortunately, it was too late. The silver needle was too fast!

Just as the silver needle was about to pierce through the man with the mustache, his figure suddenly disappeared into thin air!

“Qin Yu, f*ck you!”

The man with the mustache’s curses came from all directions, but his figure had long disappeared without a trace.

Sainess Gu didn’t seem to be surprised by the outcome. She just snorted.

“D*mn it! I was scared to death,” Qin Yu patted his chest, feeling the lingering fear.

...

He opened his mouth and was about to speak when a few sorry figures shot out from the sanctum.
