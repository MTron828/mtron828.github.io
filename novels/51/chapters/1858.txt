1859 Hall of Justice Approved It

Qin Yu raised his hand and threw the Ten Thousand Spell Breaking Punch. The terrifying power shattered everything in the surroundings.

It was the first time the crowd saw Qin Yu really fight. They were forced to step back by the formidable pressure, and even felt breathless!

However, Tong Haoyang was not threatened at all. Using the same technique, he raised his hand to receive Qin Yu’s fist.

The moment they touched, a mysterious force dispersed all the Golden Light on Qin Yu’s fist.

!!

It was as if this punch had smashed into cotton. It was originally immensely powerful, but more than half of this power was broken down by that mysterious radiance of Tong Haoyang!

Nevertheless, the fist that only had the aftershock of its might still reached and sent the incomparably arrogant Tong Haoyang flying!

The mysterious radiance on his palm became faintly discernible, and more than half of his palm was shattered by Qin Yu’s punch!

“Hmm?”

Seeing this, Tong Haoyang could not help but frown.

He didn’t expect his technique to fail!

But before he could react, Qin Yu stepped forward again!

Without delay, Tong Haoyang quickly got up and dashed into the distance.

However, the line word formula in Qin Yu’s control was not something Tong Haoyang could be compared to in the same cultivation realm.

Almost in a flash, Qin Yu had caught up with him!

Tong Haoyang, who had no choice, hurriedly hid his body in the void, attempting to avoid this attack.

But how could he escape from Qin Yu’s pursuit with such means?

Qin Yu scanned the surroundings coldly. He raised his hands, and a terrifying golden radiance gathered in his hands!

A terrifying radiance condensed between his hands, and the destructive power shook the entire world in an instant!

Even though being far away, people could still feel the terrifying power in Qin Yu’s hands!

“Boom!”

In the next second, Qin Yu threw his hands over. The force instantly covered the entire space like a fire!

“Crash!”

The space shattered like glass shards, revealing a dark void!

Tong Haoyang, hiding in the void, fell out of the void and spat out mouthfuls of blood!

“Go to hell!”

Qin Yu shouted, and his iron fist punched over swiftly!

However, at this critical moment, the peak master hurriedly stopped Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, this is against the rules of the Demon-slaying Peak,” he frowned, shook his head, and said.

Qin Yu’s face was cold. He gritted his teeth and said, “Rules? What kind of bullsh*t rule is this?”

“If you guys want to fight, you can issue a letter of challenge. You will then be responsible for your own life and death, but not now,” the peak master said in a deep voice.

Although Qin Yu was full of anger, he knew the peak master was the keeper of order who guarded the rules.

Moreover, the peak master had indeed helped Qin Yu a lot. If he ignored him, the peak master was the one to be punished in the end.

Qin Yu’s internal qi began to dissipate slowly.

The golden radiance also gradually faded.

He looked at Tong Haoyang coldly and said, “Tomorrow, I will definitely kill you.”

Tong Haoyang wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and looked solemn.

It was obvious that Qin Yu’s strength was very different from what he knew.

“See you tomorrow.” In the end, Tong Haoyang still agreed.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything else. He picked up the box, turned around, and left.

The crowd looked at each other, and could not believe the terrifying power just now was coming from Qin Yu.

“Is this really Qin Yu’s strength?”

“It’s… It’s different from what we’ve imagined…”

“No wonder he dared to go to the Tong family…”

“This is just the tip of the iceberg. Qin Yu’s true strength is much more terrifying than you can imagine!” Chang Mang sneered and said.

They would think Chang Mang was joking if it were in the past. But now, they had changed their minds. All of them were very shocked.

Even Jiu Xiao had a look of surprise on his face.

In the cave abode, Qin Yu activated his Meridian Circulation Technique, trying his best to restrain the anger and impulse in his heart.

He didn’t know why the inner demons acted up again under this anger. It was as if a hundred claws were scratching his heart.

He quickly took out the remaining primordial spirits and swallowed them all. Only then did the feeling slowly disappear.

Qin Yu opened his eyes and took a deep breath. He couldn’t help but recall the terrifying scene he had encountered during the Tribulation.

The Pure Heart Sutra could only temporarily suppress it. It was impossible to get rid of it.

No one knew to what extent the inner demon would evolve. Even with Qin Yu’s current ability, he couldn’t afford to pry into the root of the problem.

Qin Yu stood up slowly, waiting for the arrival of the following day.

A moment later, the peak master walked in from outside.

He went straight to Qin Yu’s side, sat down, and said with a bit of emotion, “You won’t be angry with me, will you?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Of course not. You didn’t do anything wrong. Besides, there’s no rush to kill him.”

“Mmm,” the peak master responded. He then said with some doubt, “What was in that box? Why were you so angry?”

Qin Yu’s face turned cold. He then said coldly, “Jue Wu’s palm.”

The peak master’s mouth agape and fell silent.

“Perhaps you can spare his life and get some useful information out of him,” the peak master said after a while.

“No, I won’t.” This time, Qin Yu surprisingly refused.

“I don’t want to create new problems that complicate the issue,” he said with a cold face. “No matter what kind of power the Tong family has, I won’t let them go.”

“Mmm,” the peak master responded. At this moment, he stood up and said, “Let me tell you the good news. The mission has just been issued.”

Qin Yu was stunned for a moment and then felt somewhat relieved.

“Finally, the day has come.” Qin Yu let out a breath.

...

“A total of 18 people are going to the Tong family,” the peak master said. “You can choose for the 18 people.”

“No,” Qin Yu shook his head and said. “I’ll leave it to you and Jiu Xiao.”

The peak master didn’t say much and just nodded.

“We’ll leave three days later. Get yourself ready.” The peak master patted Qin Yu’s shoulder. He then turned around and walked out.

Qin Yu slowly adjusted his internal qi, waiting for the arrival of the following day.

On the other end, Tong Haoyang was also sitting cross-legged in the cave abode, slowly recovering his internal qi.

As the number one young talent of the Tong family, he was naturally not afraid of anything. However, as he was not clear about Qin Yu’s background, he was a little worried for a moment.

Tong Haoyang carefully analyzed the short fight that day. Countless fighting scenes appeared in his mind.

This guy was indeed terribly talented. He tried to simulate the fight with Qin Yu with his consciousness, deducing the outcome of the fight.

Out of the 38 simulations, Tong Haoyang won 23.

“Eh? The chaotic body?” At this moment, Tong Haoyang suddenly thought of something.
