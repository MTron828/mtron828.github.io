“As expected of the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets. They’ve analyzed my abilities so thoroughly with just one attack. They truly are the most mysterious force in the three realms.”

Chen Zhisha softly called out the name of Buddha.

The kasaya on his right arm fluttered and countless runes appeared again.

A hundred ghosts circled his arm again.

In the next moment, the power of a hundred ghosts penetrated Chang Mang’s unmovable strength.

The Hundred Ghosts Parade directly surrounded the three of them. Qin Yu only felt a cold power devour his body.

A fair hand reached out from the moment of restriction.

A diamond-shaped transparent space floated between the palm.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

As the space appeared, the figures of the Hundred Ghosts Parade suddenly overlapped.

Holy Daughter Meng Jing’s body exploded with violent Saint Power.

At this moment, the eternal night sky of the Saint Kingdom seemed to have lit up for a short while.

Countless Saint Power thunderbolts lit up the night sky instantly. Then the Saint Power gathered in her palm.

It directly attacked Chen Zhisha like an energy cannon.

The terrifying power destroyed the power of the hundred ghosts and instantly sent Chen Zhisha’s kasaya flying.

A dazzling golden light erupted from his body.

As he put his hands together, the Buddhist scriptures on his body were revealed.

These runes were like dancing symbols. Each of them emitted a powerful power of the kingdom, resisting the saintess’ power of Saint Kingdom. “What a terrifying Saint Power! As expected of the Holy Daughter Meng Jing.”

This was also the first time Qin Yu had seen the holy daughter attack with all her might.

“As expected of the holy daughter that was born for this land. Even if my 20 Hearts of Saint Kingdom were to explode at the same time, I’m afraid it would still be far inferior!”

Chang Mang was also extremely shocked.

“God’s Space!”

The power of the holy daughter completely erupted in the battle.

The peak power of level 13 completely exploded. At this moment, the space was like a Rubik’s cube.

Countless chaotic places appeared, but the holy daughter seemed to have deliberately avoided it. The chaotic power did not affect Qin Yu and the other two.

A river of time suddenly fell amid the terrifying holy energy attack.

The three-dimensional power instantly turned into four-dimensional power.

The power of the past, present, and future overlapped. The entire space seemed to melt in an instant.

This terrifying power flashed past and Chen Zhisha had long disappeared.

The next moment, golden raindrops fell again.

Chen Zhisha slowly descended from the sky, stepping on the lotus flower.

The holy daughter’s face was a little pale, but she seemed to have expected this.

She was not too surprised.

“Holy daughter, your power seems to have weakened quite a bit.”

Chen Zhisha bowed slightly to the holy daughter as if he respected the person who guarded Dao Xuan.

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically as he looked at Meng Jing, who could not stand steadily.

The holy daughter had been severely injured in the last battle with Chen Zhisha.

At this moment, using such a powerful force would probably burden her body.

Qin Yu took a step forward and suddenly stood in front of the holy daughter.

He wanted to summon Sir Dagger again, but the dagger seemed to have fallen asleep. No matter how he summoned it, he could not materialize it. “This power doesn’t belong to you. I’m afraid you can’t use it freely.” Chen Zhisha stared at Qin Yu and said with a smile.

“I didn’t expect to see such a scene today when I parted ways with you back then. ”

Qin Yu was still very young at that time. He saw that Chen Zhisha was unwilling to kill the monster race.

At this moment, he turned around in a daze as if he was in a dream.

Chen Zhisha shook his head and smiled bitterly. His right arm once again emitted a terrifying runic power.

The runes on Chen Zhisha’s right arm ignited once again. The power of a hundred ghosts was then activated.

However, all the strength in his body disappeared in the next moment.

He looked up slightly.

Two figures appeared, one old and one young.

“Do people from the outer realms want to step into the karma of this place? I’m afraid you can’t leave easily then.”

Chen Zhisha muttered.

In the next moment, he waved his kasaya and a strong wind rose from the ground.

When the dust settled, he disappeared into the sky on the golden lotus.

The old Daoist sighed.

“Grandpa, why don’t we kill this despicable guy? He seriously injured Sister Meng Jing! ”

The child at the side said anxiously.

“This is already the last time. The person is right. This kind of karma might cause us to encounter a huge calamity. If I weren’t a good friend of Chen Shuang, I wouldn’t have taken action two times.”

The old Daoist sighed softly.

“Who are those two? Chen Zhisha must have been scared away by them.”

Aiden could no longer care about his elven self. He sat on the ground and panted as if he had survived a disaster.

“He should be a good friend of Chen Shuang. He probably helped us because of Saint Chen Shuang’s friendship.”

Qin Yu looked at the sound of the old and young leaving and could roughly guess.

That person was the one who had used Ethereal Enlightenment previously. His Ethereal Enlightenment had allowed Qin Yu to predict the danger of death twice.

This made him survive two deadly situations. He had even directly appeared to save them this time.

The four of them fell into a long silence. Chen Zhisha was far more powerful than they had imagined.

This person was also someone that Chang Mang and the holy daughter had no choice but to face.

Chang Mang’s Divine Might Chasing Star holy body was almost perfectly compatible with the Heart of Saint Kingdom, while the holy daughter was born in response to the kingdom.

Chen Zhisha was the one who wanted to destroy this Saint Kingdom. The power of ten Hearts of Saint Kingdom had been lost until now.

Furthermore, Chang Mang would be on his kill list if he were to pursue the Heart of Saint Kingdom.

They would probably have died if the old Daoist did not intervene.

Even the silly Chang Mang felt a rare sense of pressure.

“Qin Yu, send me back to the small house in Lingxu City. I’m so tired.”

Meng Jing’s body trembled slightly. Her expression was completely different from before.

Qin Yu sighed and slowly carried Meng Jing.

He knew that the holy daughter who was always traveling might have faded.

Only then would her other personality come out. One had to know that the girl who only appeared in the small house would never appear outside unless Meng Jing was in danger.

“What’s this?”

Aiden and Chang Mang were confused.

“It’s hard to explain. You can think of it as the holy daughter’s sub-personality.

Her other soul is probably severely injured and won’t recover in a short time.”

“The battle recorded by the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets was indeed earth-shattering. The pavilion has never announced the location. I didn’t expect it to be in this Nine Nether Cliff.”

Aiden was enlightened.

“Then what do we plan on doing now? Lingxu City is extremely far from here. Are we just going back directly?” Aiden asked with a frown..
