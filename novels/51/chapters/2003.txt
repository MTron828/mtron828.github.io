2004 Yan Guyun’s Arrival

Perhaps all of this was a man-made cover-up.

Relying on the tremendously vile appearance and the terrifying killing intent, it forced back those who came close.

The real killer was very likely on the other side.

Thus bringing Jue Wu and the third princess along, Qin Yu continued to move forward.

!!

According to the direction he had deduced, Qin Yu did not see another house. However, a small array platform was in a symmetrical position.

Qin Yu quickly walked forward. He arrived near the array platform and discovered a skeleton on the array platform too!

However, different from the skeleton on the opposite side looked dried up, this skeleton looked even more translucent. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Qin Yu took a deep breath and muttered, “Looks like my guess is correct. The terrain here is the Tai Chi Diagram…”

Thinking of this, Qin Yu swept his gaze around and could not help but frown.

“But who has deliberately changed the appearance of this place…” Qin Yu whispered to himself.

If Qin Yu had not been sensitive enough to the Tai Chi Diagram, he could not have seen the actual appearance of this place.

“There’s a skeleton here too. What’s going on?” Jue Wu muttered.

“I don’t know either,” Qin Yu shook his head and said.

He stretched out his hand and placed it on the skeleton.

As expected, this skeleton also emitted an extremely mysterious glow.

“Is it related to me or my physique?” Qin Yu was shocked.

He moved the skeleton away, but did not see unsual changes on the array platform.

Qin Yu went around this array platform for a long time. However, he still could not detect any changes.

“D*mn it! If only the man with the mustache were here,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

With his experience, he would definitely know the secret here.

“Man with the mustache, I know you’re around. Stop hiding and come out, ” Qin Yu tried to shout.

Unfortunately, the man with the mustache did not show up this time.

It was evident even the man with the mustache had never discovered this place.

“What secret is hidden here?” Qin Yu scratched his ears and cheeks anxiously, but he had no idea.

“Don’t overthink for now. I’m hungry. Hurry up and find something to eat.” Jue Wu patted her belly.

Transmitting her internal qi to Qin Yu just now consumed a large amount of her spiritual power. She needed to replenish her physical strength now.

Fortunately, there were many creatures here. Soon, Jue Wu brought back a few wild beasts and roasted them.

Qin Yu, on the other hand, did not have such leisure. He sat there cross-legged and tried to deduce the dao technique on this land.

However, Qin Yu’s level was too low, and he failed to deduce anything at all.

After much thought, Qin Yu decided to stay here for the time being. He guessed the people from the other aristocratic families could not find him anytime soon.

If he could find some great opportunities here, everything would be worthwhile.

The sky gradually darkened, and Jue Wu started to feel sleepy. She lay down and fell asleep.

The pampered third princess was even more sleepy and had fallen asleep much earlier.

Qin Yu was the only one trying hard to recall the relevant details and the legends about the Tai Chi Diagram.

Back on Earth, the Tai Chi Diagram contained the universe and all living things. The so-called Tai Chi gave birth to all living things, indicating the beginning of the world.

“Initial…” Qin Yu silently pondered over this word.

He suddenly thought of a possibility!

Chaos!

Heaven and earth started from chaos. In addition to the special reaction between Qin Yu and the two skeletons, was the secret of chaos or chaotic body hidden here?

Thinking of this, Qin Yu suddenly woke up!

“I understand now,” Qin Yu murmured.

This place probably needed a special method to move the entire land before discovering the secret below!

However, with Qin Yu’s methods, he could not move this land because he did not know the formation of the terrain.

“If I can find the man with the mustache, I might be able to obtain the opportunity of this chaos!” Qin Yu instantly became tremendously excited!

He hurriedly got up and planned to leave this place.

But when he saw Jue Wu sleeping soundly, he dismissed the idea.

“Let’s wait until they wake up. It doesn’t make much difference with a day or two anyway,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

However, at this moment, several incredibly powerful internal qis were rapidly approaching!

These internal qis instantly made Qin Yu feel unease in his heart!

“Someone is coming!” Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically!

The terror of these internal qis was beyond imagination. It was completely different from the internal qi he sensed during the day!

Qin Yu suddenly stood up. Without thinking much, he immediately woke Jue Wu up from her sleep.

“Keep an eye on the third princess. Someone is coming,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Jue Wu sat up abruptly. She hurriedly ran to the third princess and woke her up. Then she grabbed her neck.

...

The third princess, suddenly awakened, was dumbfounded. However, she dared not say anything when she saw the fiendish Jue Wu.

Qin Yu looked coldly toward the source of the internal qis and waited quietly.

A moment later, the void began to tremble.

Following that, figures appeared in front of Qin Yu, one after another.

Their movements were tremendously fast, silently blocking Qin Yu and Jue Wu.

In the next second, a big and tall man walked out of the void.

His expression was cold and dignified. He was authoritative without getting angry. The internal qi on his body made people prostrate and worship him.

“You came fast.” Qin Yu’s heart was in turmoil, but his look remained calm.

He looked at the big and tall man opposite him and asked in neither an overbearing nor self-effacing tone, “Who are you?”

The man placed his hands behind his back and said coldly, “Yan Guyun of the Yan family.”

“People from the Yan family?” Qin Yu’s expression turned even uglier. Not far away, Jue Wu was incredibly vigilant, afraid that Yan Guyun would snatch the third princess away.

...

Qin Yu took a deep breath. He didn’t want to conflict with the Yan family, so he bowed and said, “I have no intention of becoming enemies with the Yan family. The reason I did this was I really had no choice. I hope senior can understand.”

“Understand? You snatched the third princess of the Yan family, and you still dare to seek my understanding?” Yan Guyun’s attitude was extremely overbearing.

“As long as Senior allows us to leave, I guarantee the third princess will return to the Yan Family safe and sound,” Qin Yu frowned and said.

“Are you qualified to negotiate with me?” Yan Guyun said coldly.

“Stop talking nonsense!” Jue Wu, by the side, immediately scolded. “If you continue to talk nonsense, I’ll snap her neck!

“Oh?” Yan Guyun raised his eyebrows. At this moment, his eyes suddenly jerked, and Jue Wu’s body flew out uncontrollably!

The third princess, who was now out of JUe Wu’s control, was easily rescued by Yan Guyun!

All of this happened in a flash. The speed was so fast that no one could react in time!

“What terrifying strength!” Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically! The strength of Yan Guyun opposite him had reached an unimaginable level!
