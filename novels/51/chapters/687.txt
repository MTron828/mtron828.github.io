Qin Yu’s purpose in reviving these two corpses was to save Yan Ruoxue.

After spending so much time, he finally succeeded in resurrecting them. Qin Yu didn’t want to waste a minute.

“Oh right, I have to remind you that these corpses can only last for three days at most,” The mustache man reminded him.

Qin Yu calculated the time and nodded. “Three days is enough.”

As long as the Jingdu Martial Arts Association was afraid, it was enough.

Then, Qin Yu looked at the mustache man and said, “These two corpses... how much power can they display now?”

The mustache man spread his hands and said, “After all, they are already dead, and only their body remains. In other words, they are no different from magic artifacts. The extent of their power depends on the strength of their controller.”

“For example, a Martial Saint Weapon can only be used to its maximum power in the hands of a Martial Saint. Next, will be a Martial Marquis. If an Inner Strength Master obtains the Martial Saint Weapon, then I’m afraid it will be no different from scrap metal.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and roughly understood the meaning of the mustache man’s words.

“According to my speculation, these two corpses should be the guardians of the path. However, I don’t know what the purpose of the Guardians is.” The mustache man speculated.

Qin Yu touched his chin and said, “These two Guardians faced a peak-stage Martial Marquis with almost no effort. It should not be difficult for them to deal with a Martial Saint.”

When the mustache man heard this, he could not help but ridicule, “Martial Saint? If these two Guardians can use their full strength, then the Martial Saint is just an ant.”

“Cut the crap.” Qin Yu rolled his eyes.

If they could unleash their full strength, leaving the small Jingdu Martial Arts Association aside, even a country would not be worth mentioning.

The sky had already turned white, and Xiao Yu had also woken up from her slumber.

“You slept quite well. You can even sleep with such a loud noise.” Qin Yu said half-jokingly and half-seriously.

Xiao Yu rubbed her sleepy eyes and said, “I don’t know why, but I feel so sleepy and listless.”

Qin Yu didn’t think too much about it, but the mustache man next to him frowned.

He narrowed his eyes, thinking about something.

Afterward, Qin Yu returned to the Green Moon Villa with a few people.

In the hall.

Zhen Yue looked at the two male corpses. He couldn’t help but ask in surprise, “Mr. Qin, who are these two people?”

Qin Yu opened his mouth. For a moment, he did not know how to explain.

“They... They are my friends. One is called Burly and the other is Robust,” Qin Yu said.

Hearing this, the mustache man spat out a mouthful of water.

“These names... are so down-to-earth.” Zhen Yue couldn’t help but laugh.

The man with the mustache rolled his eyes and said, “If they are to personally hear of?these two names, they will strangle you to death.”

Qin Yu was quite satisfied with these two names.

After Qin Yu gave some instructions to Zhen Yue, he was prepared to go to Jingdu.

“Qin Yu, remember my words. They can only last for three days at most. After three days, they will become corpses again,” The mustache man reminded before he left.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “I’ll remember it.”

After parting with the mustache man, Qin Yu rushed to Jingdu.

...

Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

Two iron doors that were several meters high appeared extremely solemn and heavy.

At the door, a man was smoking and looking around his surroundings.

This man was none other than Xia Hang.

Ever since he caught Qin Yu last time, his status had risen accordingly.

Not only that, the various aristocratic families had been putting pressure on the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

This external pressure was almost all resolved by Xia Hang. As a result, Xia Hang’s status had risen sharply, almost to the same level as Qu Xie.

“President Xia.” Those who passed by the Jingdu martial arts association greeted Xia hang politely.

The word “vice” in “Vice President Xia” had unknowingly disappeared, and this made Xia Hang quite happy.

“President Xia, you seem to be in a good mood.”

At this moment, a familiar voice sounded in Xia Hang’s ear.

Hearing this voice, Xia Hang’s expression instantly changed slightly.

He hurriedly turned around, and it was indeed Qin Yu who stood behind him.

A hint of nervousness flashed across Xia Hang’s face. He looked around, and after making sure that there was no one, he pulled Qin Yu to the side.

“Are you crazy? Qu Xie is gathering people to capture you, and you still dare to come here? Are you looking for death?!” Xia Hang scolded in a low voice.

Qin Yu smiled and ignored this sentence. Instead, he said, “I’ll have to trouble President Xia to inform him that Qin Yu wants to have a talk with him.”

Xia Hang’s pupils constricted, and he couldn’t help but curse, “Are you really crazy?! Do you think Qu Xie will talk to you?”

Qin Yu smiled faintly and said, “Just do as I say. I know what to do.”

Xia Hang wanted to say something, but at this time, someone walked out of the association.

Xia Hang quickly changed his expression. He pointed at Qin Yu and said, “Stand here and don’t go! I’ll go and inform President Qu now!”

...

At this time, in Qu Xie’s office, there were eight black-gold robes and three purple robes.

Not only that, but Qu Xie was also holding a Martial Saint Weapon.

This Martial Saint Weapon was the Prajna ruler that Qu Xie had used that day.

Looking at the people in front of him, Qu Xie took a deep breath and said, “The aristocratic families have been pressuring the Jingdu Martial Arts Association to get rid of Qin Yu as soon as possible.”

Everyone remained silent and waited for Qu Xie’s next words.

Qu Xie continued, “But this Qin Yu is full of tricks. I don’t know what method he used to kill four of our purple robes!”

At this point, Qu Xie took out the Prajna ruler.

He placed the Prajna ruler on the table and said, “To prevent any accidents, I asked the higher-ups for another Martial Saint Weapon. As long as we can kill Qin Yu, even if we lose a Martial Saint Weapon, it’s worth it!”

“President Qu, you’d better tell us where Qin Yu is,” A purple-robed man said coldly.

“That’s right. As long as you tell us about Qin Yu’s recent activity, he will die without a doubt.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Qu Xie said in a deep voice, “I’ve just received news that Qin Yu has returned to the Green Moon Villa.”

“Got it.”The purple-robed man grabbed the Prajna ruler on the table and turned to leave.

At this moment, Xia Hang pushed the door open and walked in.

Qu Xie glanced at Xia Hang and said unhappily, “Who let you in? Can’t you knock on the door? Get out!”

Xia Hang snorted and said, “I’m here to tell you something important.”

“You have to knock on the door first! I’m your superior!” Qu Xie shouted.

Xia Hang lit a cigarette and sat directly opposite Qu Xie. Then, he said slowly, “Aren’t you looking for Qin Yu? He’s at the entrance of the association right now. He said he wants to have a talk with you.”
