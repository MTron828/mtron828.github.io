Chapter 1380: Chapter 1,380, cynicism 1

Qin Yu heard elder Bai’s words clearly from the side.

Back then, Di Zun had scored 91 points on the god testing stone. This was indeed shocking.

However, the god Testing Stone’s test was not 100% accurate. It could only be used as a screening.

Many people who scored high on the god testing stone had mediocre results.

Now that the Heavenly Cloud sect paid so much attention to Di Zun, it was enough to show that Di Zun had shown superhuman talent in his subsequent cultivation.

“So, you don’t plan to kill them?”Someone asked in surprise.

Elder Bai waved his hand and said with a faint smile, “No, no. We agreed to Di Zun for the time being, but not necessarily in the future.”

“Just because we don’t kill them doesn’t mean that others won’t get rid of them.”

“Elder Bai, what do you mean?”Someone asked doubtfully.

Elder bai snorted and said, “As disciples of the sect, we naturally have to go out to gain experience. When the time comes, we’ll just arrange for them to go to the Green Rock Forest.”

“If they die, it’s not our fault. But anyone with a discerning eye knows that this is the will of the Heavenly Cloud Sect.”

“I see. Elder Bai is indeed good!”Everyone bragged.

Outside the door, Qin Yu’s face turned black. He immediately spat a few more mouthfuls of Phlegm into the plate.

He pushed the door open and sent the food in his hand in.

Elder Bai Glanced at Qin Yu and didn’t have any special reaction. This made Qin Yu slightly relieved.

After walking out of the room, Qin Yu’s face became colder and colder.

“It seems that I have to find a way to bring them out as soon as possible,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

At this moment, the waiter came up.

“Hey, why are you still here? Boss Zheng is looking for you!”The waiter said.

Qin Yu agreed and then hurried to the backyard.

In the backyard, boss Zheng was standing there waiting for Qin Yu.

There was a woman beside him. Qin Yu glanced at him and found that this woman was quite delicate and pretty. Her figure was obviously weak, but there was a faint aura fluctuation.

“Hey, where did you go?”After seeing Qin Yu, boss Zheng hurried over.

Qin Yu said, “I saw that the waiter was too busy, so I helped him deliver the food.”

Boss Zheng waved his hand. He pulled the honest young man and said, “Ding Yi, in the future, he... Hey? What’s Your Name?”

Boss Zheng suddenly turned around and looked at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “My name is Yan Qin.”

“Yan Qin? Are you from the Yan Family?”Upon hearing this, boss Zheng frowned slightly.

Qin Yu hurriedly waved her hand and said, “No, no, no. If I were from the Yan family, why would I come here?”

“That’s true.”Boss Zheng nodded.

He didn’t think too much and immediately said to the woman, “Ding Yi, you will take care of Yan Qin in the future, understand?”

Ding Yi didn’t say much and just nodded.

After boss Zheng left, Ding Yi said to Qin Yu, “What’s your relationship with Boss Zheng?”

“It’s nothing. I’m just here to work,”Qin Yu said casually.

Ding Yi nodded and continued, “You’re going to deliver the goods with us later. Make some preparations.”

“So Fast?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but be a little surprised.

Ding Yi snorted coldly and said, “These people from the heavenly cloud sect are like pigs. They eat a lot more than the pigs in my hometown.”

After saying this, Ding Yi turned around and left.

Qin Yu spread out her hands and muttered, “It seems that this Ding Yi doesn’t like the heavenly cloud sect very much.”

When evening came, Ding Yi and Qin Yu were ready to deliver the goods.

Elder Bai and the others also slowly left.

Ding Yi looked at them and couldn’t help but snort coldly, “A bunch of pig heads who only know how to eat and drink every day.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but ask, “You seem to have a problem with them.”

“Of course I have a Problem!”A trace of anger instantly flashed across Ding Yi’s face.

“I don’t know how many people in my hometown have starved to death. In order to survive, they even changed their children and ate! Look at this group of pig heads from the Heavenly Cloud sect. They eat and drink every day, wasting things.”Ding Yi couldn’t help but gnash his teeth as he said.

Qin Yu scratched his head and said, “But... does the starvation of your hometown have anything to do with the Heavenly Cloud Sect?”

“Nonsense! The entire South Province is under the control of the Heavenly Cloud sect. All the good things have been swept away by them.”Ding Yi cursed.

“Back then, the Heavenly Cloud sect took away all the talented people. What was left behind were the elderly, children, women, and ordinary people. How could they survive in such an environment?”

Ding Yi seemed to be getting more and more excited as he spoke. He pointed at the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s sign and said, “Including this bullshit an Fenglou. If that Zheng fellow doesn’t have a relationship with the great elder, does he have the right to supply the Heavenly Cloud Sect?”

“Even a fool can supply the Heavenly Cloud sect. Why should all the profits belong to boss Zheng?”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but be speechless.

He didn’t expect such a secular thing to happen in the holy region.

“This world isn’t fair to begin with.”Ding Yi snorted coldly. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

After she said this, she walked towards the warehouse.

“It seems that this Ding Yi is quite cynical,”Qin Yu sighed.

Then, he followed Ding Yi to the warehouse, ready to deliver goods to the Tianyun sect.
