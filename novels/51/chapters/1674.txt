Chapter 1675: Chapter 1675, tread on the Netherworld Yellow River Road 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu was extremely careful with every step he took. Because he had lost his sight, everything before him was dark. This naturally made Qin Yu even more terrified.

He held an iron rod in his right hand, a bracelet in his left hand, and the venerable fifth mountain above his head.

But even so, he was still uncertain.

In half an hour, Qin Yu had only walked a very short distance.

No one knew what they would encounter, and no one knew how far away the dragon corpse was.

Not to mention the mysterious creature that existed in the dragon burial cave, just this psychological pressure was almost unbearable for Qin Yu.

As he went deeper into the dragon burial cave, the terrifying corpse Qi in the surroundings also began to become denser.

This corpse qi seemed to have come from the netherworld, and it was extremely terrifying. The surroundings also became no longer quiet. From time to time, there would be angry howls of the Yin Wind, and there would also be swishing sounds. It was as if someone was walking.

Qin Yu was drenched in sweat, and he was incomparably terrified. He held onto the iron rod tightly, as if only by holding onto something would he be able to give him a sliver of psychological comfort.

When he was on Earth, Qin Yu had read countless rumors about Mount Tai. Not only was it the altar of the ancient emperor, but it also had rumors of the “Theory of subduing ghosts”.

The corpse qi here was so dense that Qin Yu naturally placed his hopes on the venerable fifth mountain.

The Corpse Qi became denser and denser, and that powerful pressure also assaulted him.

At this moment, the iron rod in Qin Yu’s hand began to hum and tremble violently, as if it was about to be activated under the powerful pressure of the dragon corpse!

Following that was the wristband hanging on his left hand. This wristband emitted an ice-cold internal Qi, causing Qin Yu’s wrist to almost lose consciousness.

These were all top-tier supreme treasures, yet such a strange movement had occurred. Qin Yu was instantly even more terrified.

“Swish!”

Finally, there was movement!

It was as if something was approaching Qin Yu!

Qin Yu was greatly alarmed. He grabbed the iron rod and suddenly swung it forward!

“Clang!”

It hit!

Qin Yu did not know what it hit, and he did not dare to open his eyes rashly. He only knew that something was attacking him just now!

“No, this place is too strange.”Qin Yu frowned.

There were countless times in his mind that he wanted to open his eyes, but he held back every time.

Another wave of forward movement.

The strange movements of the iron rod and the bracelet began to disappear, but the corpse qi around them became even denser and heavier.

Qin Yu could clearly feel that the venerable fifth mountain hanging above his head was releasing even more internal Qi. It was like a thick fog, soaring towards him.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s vision was no longer pitch-black. Instead, it was as if he had opened his eyes, and tens of thousands of images appeared!

This was a sea of corpses. Countless mighty realm powerhouses had their bodies cut off here. Their deaths were extremely miserable. Some had their bodies cut off, and some had their skulls lifted!

“How could this be!”Qin Yu was instantly shocked!

Before he could recover, the scene in front of him changed again. It was as if there were countless evil spirits pouncing on him. The surging killing intent and corpse qi caused Qin Yu’s entire body to tremble incessantly!

“Buzz!”

At this moment, an extremely strange figure appeared in front of Qin Yu!

He was half human and half beast. His upper body was a human body, and his lower body was actually a horse!

Not only that, he was holding a long knife in his hand. The long knife was stabbed into the ground, emitting a cold light.

“What is this? An illusion?”Qin Yu was puzzled. He was sure that his eyes were closed, so everything in front of him could only be an illusion!

However, reality disappointed Qin Yu. The strange man in the shape of a centaur held the long knife and instantly appeared in front of Qin Yu!

Qin Yu could clearly smell the corpse aura from his body at such a close distance!

This was not a living person, it was a corpse!

In the next second, the long saber in the strange man’s hand slashed towards Qin Yu! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Qin Yu’s face was filled with shock. He hurriedly grabbed his iron rod to welcome it.

“Clang!”

Qin Yu’s body was directly sent flying, and the iron rod also fell off.

That terrifying power caused Qin Yu’s expression to be greatly shocked!

“This... This isn’t an illusion!”Qin Yu was shocked, and he subconsciously opened his eyes.

As expected, that terrifying group of people was right in front of him, coldly looking at him.

His gaze didn’t seem like a dead person, it seemed like he had gained consciousness. However, the corpse aura on his body clearly indicated that he was a corpse!

The world was vast and mysterious, and powerful creatures easily gained consciousness.

For example, great cultivators at the tribulation stage could even develop their own divine sense with the magic treasures in their hands. Therefore, it was not strange that the corpse in front of them had divine sense.

Qin Yu clenched his fists. He tried to fight against this group of people.

Unfortunately, all of Qin Yu’s pride was not worth mentioning in front of him. The moment he touched it, his body was almost shattered!

“This thing has definitely surpassed the reversion void stage!”Qin Yu’s face was filled with shock!

Could it be a true saint realm corpse? If that was the case, Qin Yu had no chance of winning at all!

“WHOOSH WHOOSH WHOOSH!”

At this moment, the corpse Qi in the dragon burial cave started to explode. Level after level, they overlapped like waves.

Following that, countless creatures came. They covered the sky and covered the earth. Every one of them had the might of a saint!

“All... all of them are Saints!”Qin Yu’s eyes widened!

These creatures were all at the true Saint Realm! As far as the eye could see, there was no end!

They all looked strange and did not have human forms. However, any one of them could kill Qin Yu in an instant!

At this moment, Qin Yu was really panicking. With such a large number of true saints, let alone fighting, a single glance was enough to kill Qin Yu!

The powerful pressure formed from their bodies made Qin Yu unable to move at all.

“What exactly is going on? How could there be so many true saint realm creatures...”Qin Yu was trembling non-stop as he roared in his heart!

The terror on his face could not be concealed. At this moment, Qin Yu was somewhat regretful!

No wonder no one dared to create the dragon burial cave. Not even the various great families of the Central Plains had ever come!

This kind of power was enough to sweep through everything in the world!

Qin Yu was trembling non-stop. He tried his best to escape, but the pressure of that aura made Qin Yu unable to move at all. All the internal Qi in his body seemed to have been frozen, and he was in endless pain!

These true sages looked at Qin Yu coldly. Their bodies were emitting a strong killing intent.

In the next second, they came in front of Qin Yu and looked down at him from above.

They did not say anything. At their level, Qin Yu had become an ant. There was no need for him to even say a word to an ant.

Qin Yu was in despair. He had almost died at the hands of a saint corpse in the sacred mausoleum. Now, facing the true saints with divine sense, all he had left was despair.

He stared at everything in front of him, but he had no way to resist.
