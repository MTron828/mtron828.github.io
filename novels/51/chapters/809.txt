Chapter 810: Chapter 810: Escape from the second secret realm Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s speed was extremely fast. He gritted his teeth and used all his strength to rush towards the exit!

The closer he was to the exit, the more anxious Qin Yu became!

This was because Qin Yu had encountered too many unforeseen circumstances on the way to save Yan Ruoxue!

The exit was still flickering with light. Qin Yu suddenly felt an extremely powerful force behind him approaching!

“Not good!”Qin Yu cursed inwardly. He immediately increased his speed and sprinted towards the exit!

“Buzz!”

Along with a buzz, Qin Yu’s ears rang.

Qin Yu’s figure finally rushed out!

The internal Qi behind him instantly disappeared. Qin Yu stood at the side of the exit, panting heavily.

He threw the young girl to the side. Then, Qin Yu lowered his head and looked at Yan Ruoxue in his arms. Tears involuntarily flowed out.

“Ruoxue, I’ve finally saved you...”

At this moment, Qin Yu burst into tears and sobbed.

He half-knelt on the ground and hugged Yan ruoxue tightly. All his emotions completely exploded at this moment.

“Qin Yu...”Yan Ruoxue stretched out her jade-like fingers and gently touched Qin Yu’s face.

Qin Yu grabbed Yan Ruoxue’s hand and said in a trembling voice, “Ruoxue, it’s okay. It’s okay. I’ll take you away now...”

A smile appeared on Yan Ruoxue’s face.

She stretched out her trembling hand as if she wanted to Pat Qin Yu’s head.

However, the intense pain caused Yan Ruoxue’s hand to hang down.

“Ruoxue!”Seeing this, Qin Yu’s heart instantly felt like it was being cut by a knife.

At this moment, his hatred for the Jingdu Martial Arts Association had reached its peak!

“Jingdu Martial Arts Association... If you have to suffer, I will make you pay back a thousand times over!”Qin Yu’s angry roar spread throughout the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!

Zheng Ke coldly said from the side, “Let’s leave this place first.”

Qin Yu glanced at Zheng Ke. He took a deep breath, picked up Yan Ruoxue, and Strode out.

“You Come with me,”Qin Yu coldly said as he looked at the girl he had brought out from the second secret realm.

The girl didn’t dare to say anything and could only follow behind Qin Yu.

The three of them strode out of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

At this moment, Yan Ruoxue’s internal Qi was extremely weak. Qin Yu hurriedly transferred Qi/spiritual energy to Yan Ruoxue.

They arrived at the entrance.

Qin Yu and Zheng Ke stopped at the same time.

Zheng Ke looked at Qin Yu coldly. Qin Yu’s eyes also contained killing intent.

“Qin Yu, we want to take her away,”Zheng Ke said coldly.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “Hong Yi sect is indeed not trustworthy...”

Zheng ke sneered and said, “It’s already too late for you to know now.”

“Too late?”Qin Yu’s expression was ice-cold.

“Do you think I don’t know about your schemes and schemes? Tell those who are hiding in the dark to come out,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Zheng Ke raised his brows and immediately laughed out loud, “Alright!”

As his voice fell, several figures instantly shot out from the dark!

These people were all at the peak of the Martial Marquis realm, and there was no lack of powerful existences among them! Even Qin Yu could not see through his strength!

And this person was the leader of this operation!

“Half-step martial saint?”Qin Yu seemed to have guessed his cultivation.

Currently, the only person Qin Yu could not guess was a half-step martial saint.

“Elder Shen.”Zheng Ke walked forward and greeted him. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The man called Elder Shen turned his eyes to look at Qin Yu.

He said indifferently: “Qin Yu, our Hong Clan has always thought highly of you and we have also thought highly of Yan Ruoxue.”

“I know of your relationship with Yan Ruoxue. Why Don’t you leave the fire country with me and head to the Hong Clan? What do you think?”

Qin Yu laughed coldly and said: “Bullsh * t, do you think that’s possible?”

Elder Shen was not angry. He put his hands behind his back and said with a faint smile, “Qin Yu, do you think you still have a choice?”

Zheng ke said coldly, “This is the elder of our Hong Yi sect, Shen Yichun! It’s your good fortune that elder Shen invited you!”

Qin Yu looked at Shen Yichun coldly and said with a sneer, “I’m afraid a half-step martial saint can’t Stop Me!”

As he spoke, Qin Yu’s internal Qi exploded!

Under normal circumstances, Qin Yu would not be able to retaliate in front of a half-step martial saint.

However, Qin Yu, who possessed the power of a martial saint, was not afraid of a half-step martial saint at all!

After sensing Qin Yu’s internal Qi, Shen Yichun’s expression changed slightly.

He could not help but sigh, “Qin Yu, you’re really a talent. I’m really reluctant to kill you...”

“But if you don’t come to your senses, I can only kill you.”

“You talk too much nonsense. I don’t have that much time to talk nonsense with you!”Qin Yu coldly berated.

Shen Yichun did not say anything more. His palm immediately lit up with specks of light and crushed towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s expression was ice-cold. What responded to him was an incomparably fierce golden fist!

The power on the fist exploded in an instant! The radiance that Shen Yichun had condensed was directly crushed!

“Deng Deng Deng!”

Under this enormous force, Shen Yichun retreated several steps in succession!

A trace of shock flashed across his face!

“How is this possible?”Shen Yichun muttered in a low voice.

“Even if he has the power of a martial saint, it’s impossible for him to be my match!”

“Elder Shen, we can’t waste too much time,”Zheng Ke reminded.

Shen Yichun nodded. With a shake of his palm, numerous golden chains appeared in front of everyone.

“Qin Yu, I can’t kill you for the time being. I’ll bring you back and take care of you slowly!”Shen Yichun said coldly.

Before he could finish his words, Shen Yichun’s wrist quickly shook and the chains instantly came crushing over!

With a flash of light, the chain directly tied Qin Yu Up!

A huge force wrapped around Qin Yu’s body.

And this force seemed to be getting stronger and stronger, almost crushing Qin Yu’s bones!

“Qin Yu, this chain is a heaven-grade divine artifact. Even if you have great ability, you can’t escape!”Shen Yichun said coldly.

Following that, Shen Yichun looked at Zheng Ke and the others and berated, “Go, take him away!”

Zheng Ke nodded and immediately walked towards Qin Yu.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s internal Qi was rapidly erupting. The friction between his body and the chain produced a series of crisp sounds!

“It’s useless.”Shen Yichun could not help but sneer.

“Under this chain, even if you are extremely powerful, you can forget about it... how is that possible!”

Before Shen Yichun could finish his words, Qin Yu let out an angry roar, and golden light erupted from his entire body!

The chains that were tied to his body were instantly shattered!

“Whoever dares to stop me today, I will kill them!”Qin Yu’s body emitted waves of icy cold killing intent.

Under this killing intent, everyone could not help but Shiver!
