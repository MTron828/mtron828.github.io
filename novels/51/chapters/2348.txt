However, the human race’s actions confused him. Was there still a need for internal strife at this time?

“Qin Yu, I received news from Solitary Cloud City. A large number of criminals from the Holy Region have arrived today. It seems these people have been locked up in the prisons of various aristocratic families in the Holy Region.”

Qin Yu was shocked. If the Holy Region wanted to use these people to block the alien races, Chang Mang would probably be here, too.

“I need to make a trip to Solitary Cloud City. Send me a voice transmission if anything goes wrong, and I’ll rush over immediately.”

Qin Yu said to Jue Wu and Elder Guai. With Qin Yu’s current speed, it would only take an extremely short time for him to travel from Solitary Cloud City to the Azure Ridge Continent Continent.

“Qin Yu, be careful. Since the Holy Region could send this group of people to purgatory, they must have some means to control them. Moreover, according to what I know, many people here have close relatives in the hands of the Holy Region. This group of people is likely used to control these top-notch martial artists. You must not act recklessly.”

Ji Yue reminded.

Qin Yu nodded. In that case, Xi Menn’s younger sister would definitely appear in Solitary Cloud City.

If he had the chance, he would save Xi Menn’s sister, too.

“Why don’t you bring me along? I still have many pawns in Solitary Cloud City and will have a lot of first-hand information. We thus can make a better judgment.”

Ji Yue said after a moment of hesitation.

“Alright, I’ll have to trouble you then.”

Qin Yu put Ji Yue into the Sumeru ring and immediately set off for Solitary Cloud City.

Along the way, Qin Yu’s hands were constantly casting spells.

Shrinking Ground Into An Inch, line word formula, and Gale Resistance Boot.

At this moment, his speed was like a shooting star. After a boom, he was already a thousand miles away.

Endless chaotic qi flowed from his bones to his hands that performed the hand seals.

These two spells consumed a terrifying amount of spiritual power.

Qin Yu would not have used them to hurry if it wasn’t for an urgent matter.

But now, even if he traveled like this for half a year, he felt he would not use up all his chaotic qi, which was the terrifying part of the Glazed Holy Body.

The place was full of the stench of decay, and some people were cleaning up the rotting corpses on the ground.

Qin Yu could not be bothered. He put on his cloak and entered through the entrance of the Solitary Cloud City.

The formation of Solitary Cloud City had now almost been destroyed by the people of the Holy Region, and it might take a long time to recover.

Therefore, it actually brought convenience to him instead. Otherwise, with the formation of the Solitary Cloud City, Qin Yu felt that it might still pose a threat to him even if he cultivated the Glazed Holy Body.

The instant he entered the city gate, Qin Yu felt an internal qi scan him once, which seemed to be a magical artifact detection method.

Qin Yu did not think much about it and directly entered the city gate. He did not use his divine sense to search for Chang Mang and the others.

Previously, when he came to Solitary Cloud City, he discovered an incomparably powerful internal qi among the people who had descended from the Holy Region. The intensity of that internal qi had far exceeded that of a True Saint, so he had to be careful.

Every Holy Region aristocratic family had accumulated over tens of thousands of years. No one knew what methods they had.

The higher his cultivation, the more terrifying he would discover.

“Hmm?”

Qin Yu suddenly felt something not right after entering Solitary Cloud City.

Some divine senses swept past him as if he had been targeted.

“Qin Yu.”

A familiar voice was transmitted into Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

Ni Wuxiao.

Qin Yu’s pupils revealed a hint of killing intent.

In a radius of ten kilometers around him, countless spiritual lights lit up beneath his feet. These spiritual lights shuttled on the ground and formed a massive formation, completely separating the space here from the outside world.

He had actually been targeted the moment he entered.

Ni Wuxiao, Yao Xi, and a dozen others suddenly appeared and surrounded Qin Yu.

Almost all these people were ninth-grade True Saints! They should be elite members of the two families.

“Kneel and speak!”

Two members of the Ni Family clapped their hands, and a vast amount of spiritual energy transformed into giant palms.

Just as they were about to join forces to suppress Qin Yu, the giant palms that landed on Qin Yu’s shoulder were shattered by Qin Yu the moment they landed.

Just as the spiritual energy wanted to return to the two’s bodies, it was pulled into Qin Yu’s body and fused into the holy bone.

“How dare you!”

Ni Wuxiao’s expression turned furious, and his robe puffed up. A dense power of moonlight gathered in his hand as if he were preparing some methods.

Almost simultaneously, another three or four people activated their spells and launched powerful attacks.

Another person approached Qin Yu like a ghost. The dagger in his hand surged with the power of moonlight, wanting to cut off Qin Yu’s spine.

It was the power of rules of the Ni family’s immortal scripture. The bright moon was a supreme star, and its attack was extremely terrifying after being triggered.

“Today, we can settle old and new grudges together. I’ll collect some interest first.”

Qin Yu shouted loudly and pinched his fingers slightly.

He directly snapped the dagger into two and then, with a slight movement, appeared before the person who had sneak attacked him.

Qin Yu punched at his head.

Just as the punch was about to blast him, a bubble appeared on the man’s body, and a dense water element wrapped around his body. Countless bubble sounds rang out.

It turned out to be a defensive Saint Weapon, and when the bubble appeared, the surrounding water elements were crazily absorbed into it. It was already the embryonic form of a tribulation artifact.

The moment Qin Yu’s fist entered the bubble, he felt a massive force holding his hand from all directions.

That power penetrated every cell in his body, and his hand was like sinking into a quagmire, unable to move.

“Haha, how about my Ni family’s Misty Tear Drop?”

That person revealed a sinister smile. His other hand reached out toward Qin Yu’s stomach, wanting to grab Qin Yu’s entire dantian.

Then, three people appeared behind Qin Yu.

A vast amount of spiritual energy had already attacked his back. These people were the elites of the two families. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

When the opportunity appeared, they immediately seized it.

“A person from a small place doesn’t understand the background of our aristocratic families. I really don’t know why Saintess Yan likes such a wild kid.”

Ni Wuxiao shook his head with disdain.

“Maybe he’s quite skilled. This Saintess Yan probably isn’t a good person either,” Yao Xi sneered and continued the conversation.

Qin Yu’s face revealed a hint of killing intent, and he exerted a little strength in his hand.

The water bubble burst directly, and the power of his fist straightaway blew up the Ni family’s cultivator’s head without reservation.

The attacks of the three people behind Qin Yu landed on Qin Yu’s back, but he completely ignored them.

Qin Yu’s body did not even tremble in the immense fluctuation.

With a move of his body, he appeared before Yao Xi. His palm suddenly slapped toward Yao Xi’s face.
