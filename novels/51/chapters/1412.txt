Chapter 1413: Chapter 1,413, Zhao Wan ‘Er’s family 1

Qin Yu found a restaurant and planned to have a good meal.

Although the pill could satisfy his hunger, it was tasteless after all. It was still far from a real meal.

As soon as Qin Yu arrived, someone recognized Qin Yu.

“Excuse me, are you Qin Yu?”A young man walked up to him and asked.

Before Qin Yu could answer, someone beside him shouted, “It’s him! Qin Yu is here!”

After the shout, the surrounding people crowded around him.

The small table was forced to be replaced by a big table.

Almost all the people in the restaurant were sitting around him.

They kept asking Qin Yu about the details, such as how he defeated the Great Elder that day and Qin Yu’s cultivation.

Although Qin Yu didn’t want to pay attention to them, he couldn’t refuse them directly. He could only eat and answer with them.

“Hehe, what’s so great about Qin Yu?”

At this moment, a discordant voice came from the door.

A young master wearing a brocade cannon walked in from not far away.

He held a chain in his hand, and at the end of the chain was a ferocious tiger.

No one knew what kind of blood was flowing in this tiger’s body, but its aura was extremely strong. With each movement, one could faintly see the surrounding space fluctuating.

Obviously, this tiger was not simple.

The tiger looked at the people around it, and its eyes revealed a strong killing intent, as if it was staring at food.

“It’s Zhao Yi.”Someone recognized this person.

“Zhao Yi of the Zhao family? He’s the number one person in the younger generation of the Zhao family.”

“Zhao Family?”Hearing this, Qin Yu seemed to find it familiar.

He frowned and said in a low voice, “Could it be that this is the city where Zhao Wan ‘Er is located? What a coincidence!”

As he said this, Zhao Yi had already walked over from not far away.

The people around him hurriedly gave him a seat.

Zhao Yi sat opposite Qin Yu and said indifferently, “You are Qin Yu. I heard that you have been in the limelight recently.”

Qin Yu did not pay attention to these words. Instead, he retorted, “Do you know Zhao Wan ‘er?”

At the mention of Zhao Wan ‘er, Zhao Yi’s expression was a little unnatural.

He snorted lightly and said, “Why are you mentioning her? Why, do you two know each other?”

“Well... we should be considered friends.”Qin Yu nodded.

Then, Qin Yu pointed at the food on the table and said with a smile, “Let’s eat together?”

Such a peaceful attitude made Zhao Yi sneer.

Qin Yu felt that he was Zhao Wan ‘Er’s family, so he felt very close to her. However, in Zhao Yi’s eyes, it was a sign of weakness.

“Eat? What’s so good about these things? They’re not even for dogs,”Zhao Yi said with a sneer.

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows as if he had sensed the provocation from Zhao Yi’s mouth.

He put down the chopsticks in his hand and suddenly remembered what Zhao Wan ‘Er had said:

The entire Zhao family was indifferent to human relations, and they were extremely harsh on her.

He had thought that Zhao Wan ‘er was exaggerating, but now it seemed that what she said was probably true.

“If you’re not eating, what are you doing here?”Qin Yu asked in return.

Zhao Yi sneered. He picked up the food from the table and threw it to the tiger beside him.

The tiger ate all the food. Then, it looked at the people around it and drooled.

“I heard that this tiger ate people. Many people were eaten by him.”

“Yeah, this tiger hurt countless people. The Zhao family didn’t restrain themselves. Instead, they deliberately brought it out to show off.”The people around stepped back one after another, afraid that they would be eaten by the tiger.

Zhao Yi glanced at the surrounding people and then said indifferently, “Of course it’s to feed the animals. Other than animals, who else can eat these things?”

These words naturally caused the majority of the people in the restaurant to be dissatisfied. However, due to Zhao Yi’s identity, they dared to be angry but did not dare to say anything.

Qin Yu looked at Zhao Yi coldly. He thought for a moment and confirmed once again, “You know Zhao Wan ‘er?”

“Yes, of course I know her. Why?”Zhao Yi sneered.

Qin Yu continued, “Where is Zhao Wan ‘er now? Is she still in the Zhao Family?”

“Her? Hehe, she has long been expelled from the Zhao family by us!”Zhao Yi sneered. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

In reality, it was Zhao Wan ‘er who had abandoned the Zhao family. However, for the sake of face, the Zhao family claimed that they were the ones who had expelled Zhao Wan ‘er from the Zhao family.

“In that case, you have nothing to do with Zhao Wan ‘er anymore.”Qin Yu nodded slightly.

“So? What exactly are you trying to say?”Zhao Yi said with a cold face.

Qin Yu did not answer. He looked at the ferocious tiger beside Zhao Yi.

“You beast are not bad.”Qin Yu sized it up and said.

Speaking of this tiger, Zhao Yi suddenly said with some pride, “Of course. This is an earth root tiger. It is a high-tier demonic beast. Of course, it is also my pet.”

As he spoke, Zhao Yi patted this earthroot tiger.

The earthroot tiger seemed to know what Zhao Yi meant. It immediately bared its teeth at Qin Yu and revealed a fierce expression.

Qin Yu rubbed his chin and muttered, “That’s right. This beast does look much more fragrant than the food on the table.”

“That’s from... Huh? What do you mean?”Zhao Yi suddenly came back to his senses.

At this moment, a golden light flashed across his vision.

In the next second, this earth-rooted Tiger’s head was directly smashed into pieces by a punch!

His huge body collapsed with a loud bang, and fresh blood flowed out like a fountain!

Zhao Yi’s eyes instantly widened, and he roared angrily, “You... you dare to Kill My Pet?”

Qin Yu picked up this earth-rooted tiger with one hand, and then shouted, “Where’s the Boss? Cook this beast for me. The Tiger’s paw and the Tiger’s head are braised. Take the rest and roast them. I’ll treat everyone to Tiger Meat!”
