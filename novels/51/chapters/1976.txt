1977 The Sanctum of the Royal Family

Qin Yu was silent for a while before he said, “I feel this matter is somewhat an embezzlement.”

“Embezzlement?” Hearing Qin Yu’s words, the prince was obviously shocked.

He looked around, and after ensuring no one was around, he continued, “Why do you think so?”

Qin Yu didn’t stand on ceremony and immediately told the prince his thoughts.

After hearing this, the price couldn’t help but let out a long sigh.

“Mr. Qin, let’s change the place to talk,” the prince said while getting up.

Qin Yu understood the prince’s fear. Thus he didn’t reject it. He nodded and stood up.

A few of them came to a room in the Imperial Palace. The prince locked the door, and even the two guards who were usually responsible for protecting the prince were not allowed to enter.

“Mr. Qin, to be honest, I have the same thoughts as you.” The prince sighed.

Qin Yu was not very surprised. He said slowly, “It’s just that I can’t figure out why they’re doing this.”

“Why are they doing this?” The prince raised his head and looked at Qin Yu with a sincere expression.

Then he pointed at himself and said, “Because of me, because of the royal family.”

“What do you mean?” Qin Yu was puzzled.

“Sky City has been established in Zhongzhou for so many years, and no one has ever made a move here. Although the royal family has fallen, they are still above the nine great aristocratic families on the surface,” the prince said in a deep voice.

After hearing the prince’s words, Qin Yu immediately understood.

“You mean to say… The nine great aristocratic families want to take this opportunity to eliminate the royal family?” Qin Yu said in surprise.

“It’s very likely,” the prince said in a deep voice. “Over the years, countless people have fled to Sky City to seek protection. Many have offended the nine great aristocratic families, but they have never made a move and given up.

“But not long ago, the Yao family actually used a secret treasure to pull your friend into the void. It has disclosed their evil intentions.”

“Do you think the Yao family didn’t have such a treasure before this? Why didn’t he use it? To put it bluntly, they’re just using this opportunity to test the royal family’s attitude.”

“Is it because of me?” Qin Yu was startled and said hurriedly.

“You’re just a pretense for them. There’s no fundamental connection with you.” The prince shook his head.

He took a sip of tea and continued, “The auction house’s escort of the treasures is an extremely powerful force. No one can secretly take the treasures away. Only they can move the treasures away.”

“Aren’t they afraid of the outside world’s suspicion?” Qin Yu scratched his head.

“They were indeed worried previously, but it’s different now. The opportunity has come,” the prince said.

Qin Yu was silent for a while before he looked up and said, “The mysterious person from the demon race.”

“That’s right.” The prince took a sip of tea. “This mysterious person has killed many heirs of the nine great aristocratic families. Now, there are rumors that he might have come from the depths of Azure Rock Forest.

“As our understanding of the depths of Azure Rock Forest has always been blank, everything illogical can become logical.”

After hearing this, Qin Yu finally understood completely.

The nine great aristocratic families definitely wouldn’t allow the prince and Sky City to enjoy such a noble status. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that they even wanted to imprison the prince and turn him into a tool that could only produce spirit coins.

After repeated trials, the royal family was probably really in crisis now.

“I’m really sorry, Your Highness,” Qin Yu sighed and said. “I’m afraid I can’t help you much.”

The prince waved his hand and said, smiling, “I don’t mean to ask for your help. We’re just having a casual chat. Besides, all of this is just our guesses. It can’t be true.”

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded, but he was somewhat flustered.

Sky City’s status was probably going to become history.

“If Mr. Qin has nothing to do, why don’t you stay in the Imperial Palace for a while? Perhaps we can witness something,” the prince said, smiling.

Qin Yu agreed in the end.

After all, this place once belonged to the royal family. There must be some supreme treasures for cultivation or even opportunities here.

Moreover, Qin Yu also wanted to confirm this thought.

In the following few days, Qin Yu and Jue Wu stayed in the Imperial Palace.

The palace of the royal family was quite luxurious, and there were many residences. The prince was very generous and arranged a good place for Qin Yu to stay.

During these few days, Qin Yu had seen the remnants of the royal family.

The age of these remnants could no longer be gauged. They were weak and very old. Their conditions were pathetic.

However, they were a group of old officials who did their best to protect the prince’s safety.

On this day, the prince took Qin Yu for a stroll in the royal family’s huge back mountain garden.

The garden had a beautiful view with fragrance assailing the nostrils. And there seemed to be a wondrous smell in the fragrance.

“Your Highness, are those old seniors the last of the royal family’s strength?” Qin Yu asked tentatively.

The prince nodded and said, “To be honest, they are the last of the royal family’s remnant power. It’s a pity that they don’t have the blood of the royal family. Their cultivation has also reached the upper limit.”

At this point, the prince laughed bitterly and said, “And I, as the last inheritor of the bloodline, can’t cultivate. I can only watch the royal family fall.”

Qin Yu wanted to but didn’t know how to comfort him.

“Mr. Qin, you don’t need to say anything else. I’ve already accepted the reality,” the prince said, waving his hand.

Qin Yu nodded and scratched his head as if he wanted to ask something but felt inappropriate.

“Mr. Qin, if you have any questions, please ask,” the Prince said.

Qin Yu asked tentatively, “Your Highness, those old seniors … What cultivation realm are they in?”

The prince was silent for a while before he slowly said, “They were my father’s first generation of protectors. They were also the ones who watched my father grow up and rise to power. They’re much older than my father. As for their current strength, I’m not too sure.”

“Then why didn’t your father leave you a few guardians?” Qin Yu asked suspiciously. “Instead, he let these old seniors look after you?”

The prince laughed bitterly and said, “He did, but it’s just that they all left after our royal family declined. These few uncles are the only ones who are willing to stay.”

Qin Yu finally understood.

When the chief fell from power, his hangers-on would disperse all at once. It had been the case since ancient times.

“Mr. Qin, that place used to be a small sanctum for my father.” At this moment, a small stone platform appeared in the back mountain garden.

The stone platform had already been wrapped up by flowers and plants. It looked like a dried-up well without the slightest hint of mystery.

“Every senior of our royal family had once comprehended the dao on this platform,” the prince introduced.
