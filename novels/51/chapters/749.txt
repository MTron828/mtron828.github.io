Chapter 750: Ao Zhan Attacked Again Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Seeing the shattered Black Gold Stone, the attendant couldn’t help but widen his eyes.

This was the Black Gold Stone that was reputed to be the hardest material! Even the prison of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association used this material!

But now, this Black Gold Stone appeared to be so weak in front of Yan Jinyao!

“So... so strong...” the attendant couldn’t help but swallow hard.

Yan Jinyao snorted and said, “This is only the awakening of 80% of the bloodline power. If it can be 100% ...”

That power would be unimaginable!

This made Yan Jinyao even more jealous!

He tried all the methods he could think of, but couldn’t advance further.

80% seemed to be his limit.

“Fortunately, Yan Ruoxue can’t cultivate...” Yan Jinyao murmured.

At the thought of this, Yan Jinyao heaved a sigh of relief.

...

There were only four days left until the final battle between Qin Yu and Blackie.

On this day, Blackie was standing in front of Granny Qin in a room in the martial arts academy.

“Blackie, you are my entire hope. I see you as my descendant,” Granny Qin said indifferently as she took a sip of tea.

Blackie bowed and said, “Granny Qin, I know. I also see you as my mother.”

Granny Qin looked up at Blackie and continued, “I want you to be the number one person in the world! A person who has reached the peak of martial arts!”

“Qin Yu is only a stepping stone for you, so you can’t lose.”

A trace of disdain flashed through Blackie’s dark eyes.

He snorted. “Granny Qin, don’t worry. Qin Yu isn’t worth mentioning at all.”

Granny Qin said in a deep voice, “Don’t underestimate him too much. He just obtained a stalk of ten-thousand-year-old herb. His strength will definitely improve.”

“No worries.” Blackie clenched his fist.

“Qin Yu isn’t worth mentioning.”

Granny Qin nodded and said, “You may go.”

Blackie grunted and retreated to the side.

Although Blackie was extremely confident, Granny Qin was somewhat uncertain.

It wasn’t that she didn’t trust Blackie, but Granny Qin knew nothing about Qin Yu’s strength at the moment.

She didn’t know what kind of realm Qin Yu had reached by relying on that ten-thousand-year-old herb. If he stepped into the peak of the Martial Marquis realm, the outcome would be difficult to predict.

Granny Qin slowly stood up.

She stood up and left the martial arts academy before returning directly to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

Xia Hang was sitting in Xie Qu’s office.

Seeing Granny Qin walk in, Xia Hang quickly stood up and respectfully called out, “Granny Qin.”

Granny Qin nodded and casually asked, “Has there been any news from the higher-ups recently?”

Xia Hang shook his head and said, “No.”

Granny Qin didn’t say much and just nodded. “Got it. If there’s any news from the higher-ups, remember to inform me.”

“Yes, Granny Qin.” Xia Hang bowed and said.

Thereafter, Granny Qin sat at Xia Hang’s seat.

She poured a cup of tea and closed her eyes, as if she was waiting for someone.

About half an hour later.

A man walked in from outside the door.

This man was short, with snow-white eyebrows and a distinctive aquiline nose.

This man was none other than Ao Zhan!

“Granny Qin.” Ao Zhan walked forward and greeted Granny Qin.

Granny Qin nodded, indicating for him to sit down.

Ao Zhan smiled and said, “Granny Qin, if there’s anything you need, just tell me.”

Granny Qin stared at Ao Zhan and said coldly, “I want you to kill someone.”

Ao Zhan hurriedly said, “You only need to tell me the name.”

Granny Qin coldly spat out two words, “Qin Yu.”

Hearing this, Ao Zhan laughed.

“Last time, I let him escape by luck. Don’t worry. This time, I will definitely take his life.” Ao Zhan said with a faint smile.

Granny Qin waved her hand and said, “No, let him live.”

Ao Zhan was stunned and said in surprise, “Let him live? Why?”

“Don’t ask what you shouldn’t ask,” Granny Qin said with a frown.

Ao Zhan was a little embarrassed, but he still nodded and agreed, “I understand.”

After saying that, he turned around and walked out.

Granny Qin didn’t tell Ao Zhan about Qin Yu’s current strength.

The reason she sent Ao Zhan to kill Qin Yu was to test Qin Yu’s strength.

Of course, if Ao Zhan could conveniently cripple Qin Yu, that would naturally be the best.

...

On the other side, Qin Yu, man with the mustache, and Xiao Yu had already arrived in Jingdu.

“Xiao Yu, after you arrive in Jingdu, you must remember that the mask can’t be known by anyone, understand?” Qin Yu warned.

Xiao Yu nodded and said, “I understand.”

Since even the Han Palace knew about the existence of the mask, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association must also know.

If Xiao Yu fell into their hands, the consequences would be unimaginable.

At this time, the sky was gradually darkening, so Qin Yu temporarily found a place to stay.

“Sigh, what a pity.” The man with the mustache counted the time with his fingers.

“It’s not easy to enter a Mystic Realm, but I missed it.”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “If you can find a way to enter an ownerless Mystic Realm, I promise to return you a Mystic Realm.”

The man with the mustache muttered, “Do you think it’s that easy to enter an ownerless Mystic Realm? I’m afraid only the Jingdu Martial Arts Association knows this method.”

“Yes.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

Even the inheritance left behind by his father didn’t record it, which was enough to explain the difficulty of this method.

“I guess the method to enter the ownerless Mystic Realm was developed by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association itself,” said Qin Yu. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The man with the mustache said with some surprise, “You and I are thinking the same thing.”

“All these years, I’ve traveled all over the world and read countless ancient books, but I’ve never seen any record of the ownerless Mystic Realm.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “The ownerless Mystic Realms were most likely left behind by ancestors, and slowly became ownerless.”

“In other words, before this, there was no existence of the ownerless Mystic Realms. All the Mystic Realms were passed down from generation to generation, so naturally, there was no need for any method to crack it.”

“Yes.” The man with the mustache nodded.

“An expert from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association cracked this method.”

Qin Yu remained silent.

Cracking the ownerless Mystic Realm must involve spatial spells.

But spatial spells were definitely not something a Martial Marquis could get his hands on.

“If there’s a chance, I have to go to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s Scripture Pavilion to take a look,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

The Scripture Pavilion had too many secrets. Apart from spells, it also had a history of the development of martial arts.

Qin Yu wanted to see about Yan Ruoxue’s bloodline, his father, and the story of the masked woman.

Just as the two of them were chatting, Qin Yu’s phone suddenly rang.

He picked up the phone and saw that the caller was Xia Hang.

He said on the phone, “Qin Yu, Granny Qin sent Ao Zhan to kill you. Run!”
