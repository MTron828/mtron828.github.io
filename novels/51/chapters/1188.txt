Chapter 1189: Chapter 1,189, the Cowardly Yan Sihai 

In the living room.

Yan Sihai’s expression was extremely uncalm.

He wasn’t confident because he didn’t know what Qin Yu’s attitude would be.

“I really didn’t expect that the dignified Yan family would actually request Qin Yu...”Yan Sihai couldn’t help but curse in his heart.

“If you’re unhappy, you don’t have to come.”

At this moment, Qin Yu’s voice was heard.

Hearing this voice, Yan Sihai’s expression changed slightly.

He stood up and looked at Qin Yu.

Their eyes met, and they were filled with emotions.

No one would have thought that the status of the two of them had actually changed.

Yan Sihai took a deep breath and put down his arrogant attitude. He cupped his hands and said, “Greetings... Greetings, sect leader Qin.”

“You’re too polite, President Yan. I Can’t take on the responsibility,”Qin Yu said with a faint smile.

Yan Sihai’s expression changed slightly.

The first exchange between the two parties didn’t seem to be ideal.

But since things had come to this, Yan Sihai could only brace himself and sit down.

He took a deep breath and said, “I know you won’t let me off easily. Tell me, what do you want me to do?”

Qin Yu sat on the chair with his legs crossed. He looked at Yan Sihai with a faint smile and said, “What do you mean, President Yan?”

Yan Sihai said coldly, “Let’s cut to the chase. My Son, Yan Jinyao, wants a spot. Name your conditions.”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Yan Sihai, what do you think you can give me now? Money? Status? Luxury cars and mansions? Or do you have some top-notch spiritual artifacts?”

Yan Sihai didn’t say anything. He had already expected this, so he wasn’t surprised.

“Since I’m here to beg you, I’m prepared to be humiliated,”Yan Sihai said with a cold face.

“What do you want? Come at me.”

After saying that, Yan Sihai directly closed his eyes.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer, “Do you think I’m like you? Like to play tricks on people? Humiliate You? What’s in it for me? Just to satisfy the pleasure of being high and mighty?”

Yan Sihai slightly narrowed his eyes and said, “Then what do you want?”

Qin Yu sat up straight from the chair.

He coldly looked at Yan Sihai and said, “Do you really want a spot for Yan Jinyao?”

“Yes. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have lowered my head to look for you,”Yan Sihai said coldly.

Qin Yu laughed. “I promised Ruoxue that I would help her take back the Yan family. Now that the Holy Region has opened, if I don’t fulfill my promise, I’m afraid it will be too late.”

Yan Sihai’s expression changed slightly, and he had a faint ominous feeling in his heart.

Qin Yu continued, “It’s not impossible for Yan Jinyao to get a spot. I only have one condition. You, abdicate from the Yan family and return the position of the head of the Yan family to old Mister Yan.”

“Other than that, you also have to publicly announce what you did to old Mister Yan back then.”

Hearing this, Yan Sihai’s expression instantly changed drastically!

He suddenly stood up and glared at Qin Yu, saying, “Impossible! Qin Yu, don’t Go Too Far!”

“Too Far?”Qin Yu could not help but sneer.

“Yan Sihai, think carefully. I don’t have to discuss it with you. As long as I kill you, I can also take back the Yan family.”

Yan Sihai’s face was deathly pale, as if he had lost his mother.

He had never imagined that Qin Yu would actually ask for the entire Yan family!

This was something that he had spent countless efforts to obtain!

“Yan Sihai, let me tell you something.”Qin Yu leaned back in his chair.

“Before I head to the saint-level, I must complete this matter.”

“If you agree today, there might still be a way out. If you don’t agree, I will definitely take back the Yan family and return it to old Mister Yan.”

“As for the means, you should be clear in your heart.”

The threat in his words was not concealed. Yan Sihai was a smart person, so he naturally knew what Qin Yu meant.

If he really got close to Qin Yu, he could make a move and kill all of Yan Sihai’s people!

Since he was about to leave for the holy region, he had nothing to worry about.

Yan Sihai’s face was gloomy. He did not know whether this was a blessing or a curse.

After a full ten minutes, Yan Sihai took a deep breath and said, “Give me a few days to think about it.”

“A few days?”Qin Yu sneered.

“Do you think I have that much time to wait for you? I will only give you one night.”

“After tonight, there will be no more talks.”

Yan Sihai opened his mouth and wanted to say something, but Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “See the guest out.”

After saying this, Qin Yu no longer paid attention to Yan Sihai and turned around to walk out of the living room.

Yan Sihai could not help but gnash his teeth.

He never thought that the martial arts world would develop to such a degree one day.

He also never thought that one day, Qin Yu would look down on him from above!

After returning to the Yan family, Yan Sihai told Yan Jinyao about this matter.

“He wants the entire Yan family!”Yan Sihai slammed his fist on the table.

Yan Jinyao hurriedly said, “Dad, as long as I go to the Holy Region, everything will have a chance!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“You might as well agree to him for now. After he goes to the holy region, who else can support my grandfather? After Qin Yu leaves, you can take back the Yan family.”

A trace of fear flashed across Yan Sihai’s face.

“Your grandfather does things swiftly and decisively. Once I give up my position to him, he will eliminate all of my confidants in the shortest time possible and replace them with his own people!”

“And... Don’t forget that there is still the Heaven Gate. They will definitely do their best to protect your grandfather.”

Yan Jinyao did not think much of it.

He snorted softly and said: “The elites of the Heaven Gate will definitely be brought to the holy region. The rest is not worth mentioning at all.”

“Father, you are thinking too much. You have worked so hard for so many years, what can my grandfather Do?”

Yan Sihai sighed repeatedly.

Things had already come to this point, and he knew in his heart that he no longer had any other choice.

With Qin Yu’s current capabilities, the Yan country would definitely not offend him, much less a tiny little Yan family.

“I... . . just promise him.”Yan Si hai slumped powerlessly into his chair.
