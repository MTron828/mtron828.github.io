Chapter 941: Chapter 941, return to the fire country. [ Pyro ] 

The Immortal Crane took a sip of wine and then said: “According to our agreement, I can agree to one request of yours.”

One request?

At that moment, Qin Yu’s mentality was completely different from before.

At that time, Qin Yu had only wanted to get something out of the immortal crane, but now that Qin Yu’s gains were already so great, he did not even know how to open his mouth.

“Forget it. I’ve also gained a lot during this period of time.”Qin Yu repeatedly waved his hand.

Immortal Crane glanced at Qin Yu and said, “I’ve never owed a favor, and I won’t go back on my word.”

This made Qin Yu somewhat troubled.

He scratched his head and said, “How about this? I’ll keep this request for now. I’ll come to You When I need it in the future.”

The crane was stunned for a moment before it nodded and said, “Okay.”

Then, Qin Yu turned around and left the place.

After returning to his residence, Qin Yu packed his things and said, “We should go too.”

“Go? Go Where?”The Mustache Man muttered.

Qin Yu said, “We’ve been here long enough. Don’t tell me you’re still staying here. It’s time to go back.”

The man with the handlebar mustache stood up from the ground and muttered, “Isn’t this place good? It’s safe and comfortable.”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “Then you can stay. I’ll take my leave first.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and planned to leave.

The Man with the handlebar mustache rolled his eyes and said, “You’ve gained a lot during this period of time. I F * CKING wasted almost a month.”

Even though he said so, the Mustache Man still followed Qin Yu out of the room.

Then, Qin Yu brought the Mustache Man to the front of the immortal crane.

“We plan to leave.”Qin Yu cupped his hands to the immortal crane.

The immortal crane said indifferently, “What’s there to miss in this world? It’s better to stay here.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “I still have a lot of things to do.”

Seeing this, immortal crane didn’t say anything more.

He waved his hand, and a strong man walked over.

“Uncle Niu, send them out,”said immortal crane.

The strong man called Uncle Niu immediately cupped his hands to immortal crane and said, “Yes, Lord Immortal Crane.”

Then, Qin Yu said goodbye to Immortal Crane, followed behind Uncle Niu, and left the city.

Twenty days of cultivation had allowed Qin Yu to make great progress.

Whether it was his strength, speed, or battle experience, they had all improved greatly.

Although Qin Yu’s realm had not improved, his strength could not be compared.

This desert was extremely vast. Even with Uncle Niu leading the way, the three of them moved extremely slowly.

At night, the three of them found a place and sat down to rest.

“Uncle Niu, how many martial saints are there in this city?”Qin Yu asked in his spare time.

Uncle Niu glanced at Qin Yu and said, “Including me and Sir Xianhe, there are four of them.”

“Oh, when was Xianhe a martial saint?”Qin Yu continued to ask.

“Early-stage martial saint.”Uncle Niu said.

Qin Yu could not help but suck in a breath of cold air.

To have such strength at the early-stage martial saint was truly terrifying!

Qin Yu even felt that his strength was not inferior to Zhai Xing!

“Then what age is he?”Qin Yu asked like a chatterbox.

Uncle Niu said, “143 years old.”

Qin Yu’s eyes instantly widened, and the handlebar mustache at the side sucked in a breath of cold air.

143 years old?

The Immortal Crane was so young?

According to the mustached man’s estimation, the immortal crane was at least a thousand years old!

“To have such strength at a hundred and forty-three years old is really terrifying,”the mustached man exclaimed.

“This immortal crane is definitely a genius!”

“Of course! Although Lord Immortal Crane is young, his talent is unparalleled in the world,”Uncle Niu praised.

At the mention of Immortal Crane, Uncle Niu’s face was full of pride.

Qin Yu also sighed slightly, “Indeed, even little Black’s age is above immortal crane.”

Moreover, little black relied on the transformation pill to transform into human form.

“You guys are not demon beasts. I wonder how powerful Lord Immortal Crane is,”Uncle Niu muttered.

“To be able to rely on his own willpower to resist the bloodline suppression brought by the power of the Divine Dragon, I’m afraid only he can do it in the world.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Indeed, his willpower and state of mind are truly admirable.”

After more than twenty days, Qin Yu and the immortal crane could be considered to have come to appreciate each other.

“Alright, rest early. We still have to hurry on the road tomorrow.”Uncle Niu turned over and fell asleep.

Qin Yu was not in the mood to sleep.

He gazed at the night sky and could not help but mutter in a low voice, “I wonder how she’s doing now, whether she has embarked on the path of cultivation, and what kind of realm she’s in...”

“Alright, don’t think about it anymore. She has the complete bloodline of the Yan family. Even if she goes to the Yan family, she will still be treated as a princess.”The Handlebar Mustache Man yawned.

Qin Yu sighed. The longing for Yan Ruoxue was simply impossible to suppress.

... . .

At that moment, within the borders of the Pyro Nation.

The actions of the Sky Blood Rainbow were becoming more and more rampant, and countless people were already on the verge of enduring it.

However, Tian Xue Hong’s strength was unfathomable. No one dared to act rashly.

It was only until this day that the impulsive Chang Mang issued a challenge to Tian Xue Hong.

Only after the great battle between the two sides did they learn that Tian Xue Hong was only at the half-step martial saint stage. Chang Mang had been defeated in one move!

At this moment, everyone understood that the reason why Tian Xue Hong could be so rampant was because of his white bone army! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

As long as the white bone army was present, no one would be able to do anything to the Sky Blood Rainbow!

At the same time, more and more young disciples walked out from the secret realm. It seemed that they all wanted to find the opportunity to become a martial saint in this world.

...

Another Day passed, and Qin Yu and the handlebar moustache were still unable to walk out of this desert.

“Uncle Niu, how much longer will it take?”Qin Yu could not help but ask.

Uncle Niu pointed ahead and said: “At most a day, we will be able to step into the fire country’s borders.”

“Phew.”

Hearing those words, Qin Yu could not help but heave a sigh of relief.

Another Day passed.

The group of three had finally stepped into the fire country’s borders.

“I will send you all here.”Uncle Niu said.

Qin Yu was just about to say goodbye when the handlebar mustache suddenly pulled Uncle Niu back and said: “Uncle Niu, look at what you are saying. You have sent us off for so long, we should at least treat you to a meal?”

Uncle Niu frowned slightly and snorted lightly, “I’m not interested in the human world.”

“Aiya, don’t say that. I’ve never owed anyone a favor. No matter what, I have to treat you to a meal!”The Mustache Man patted his chest and said.

Uncle Niu frowned. It was difficult to reject such a kind offer, so he finally agreed.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but pull the mustache man to the side and whispered, “What are you up to again?”

The handlebar moustache said in a low voice: “I have speculated that we might have a disaster in the next two days, so I have to think of a way to get him to escort us.”

“With a martial saint protecting us, we have nothing to be afraid of.”

Qin Yu thought about it and it seemed to make sense.

After all, they had entered the fire country’s borders, it would indeed be safer to get Uncle Niu to escort them to Pyro.
