2090 The Gathering of Geniuses

This instantly reminded Qin Yu of the scene of the breakthrough at the Immortal Emperor Lei’s Big Graves back then.

At that time, it seemed to be the collision of two dao techniques. The dao techniques even passed through the grave and transformed into a man-shaped dao technique.

“I’m just guessing. Just take it as a casual chat,” Saintess Gu smiled and said.

Qin Yu was silent, but the shock in his heart was beyond words.

Looking at the small world of the Teng family opposite him. he narrowed his eyes and said, “Saintess Gu, do you know the Teng family well?”

“The Teng family is a tremendously mysterious aristocratic family,” Saintess Gu said. “They have existed longer than any other aristocratic family. They’re indeed the first family of the nine great aristocratic families. As they are usually mysterious and unpredictable, people don’t know much about the Teng family.”

Qin Yu looked at the small world and noticed an incredibly oppressive force hidden in every part of this small world.

This power was hard to predict. It had even surpassed the Holy Power. It was also different from the power and might a tribulation magical artifact emitted.

“Teng Zixu has been in a closed-door retreat for ten years just to break through to the True Saint Realm. It was both terrifying and yet strange.” Qin Yu said casually.

“What do you mean, Brother Qin?” Saintess Gu asked in surprise.”

“It’s nothing. Perhaps Teng Zixu is really talented,” Qin Yu replied casually.

Of course, this was not what Qin Yu thought at all.

Ten years ago, the Golden Age had not descended, yet Teng Zixu had dared to use ten years of closed-door cultivation to break through. It was indeed unbelievable.

Unless Teng Zixu was like Wu Ji, he could create his own dao technique and break through all restrictions.

However, this was too difficult. It was really unbelievable.

At this moment, the people from the other aristocratic families arrived one after another. Not far away, the people from the Si family also walked in one after another.

The leader was naturally Si Qianjing. Compared to the Si family’s previous trip, it was more low-key this time. There were only a few people. Other than Si Qianjing, there was not even a True Saint.

“Si Shiyue didn’t come?” Qin Yu looked around and was a little surprised.

“Si Shiyue has gone for retreat,” Saintess Gu said with a smile. “I heard he seemed to have comprehended something after the trip to the Chaos Grave.”

“Oh?” Qin Yu was a little surprised.

“Speaking of which, Si Shiyue is indeed a talent. He’s very different from his father. When his father found out you had the supreme bone, he was so angry that he fainted on the spot. However, after Si Shiyue learned that you had the Traceless Immortal Scripture, he was incredibly calm as if he had comprehended some new rules of the dao technique,” Saintess Gu said.

Si Shiyue’s reaction surprised Qin Yu. Under normal circumstances, he would explode in anger, if not furious.

Soon, Si Qianjing’s gaze fell on Qin Yu.

Their eyes met. Si Qianjing shot a cold look at Qin Yu, but he did not say anything and quickly retracted his gaze.

“Your Dao companion is here as well,” Saintess Gu suddenly spoke at this moment.

Qin Yu was stunned. Following that, he looked in the direction of the exit.

As expected, Yan Ruoxue was here too!

Yan Ruoxue was wearing a plain white dress. The hem of the dress danced lightly along her steps like a fairy descending to the mortal world.

Her long hair draped over her shoulders like a waterfall. A few strands of her soft hair danced in the wind. Her eyes were as clear as blue waves, and her bright eyes sparkled like stars, filled with wisdom and mystery.

Her skin was crystal clear like snow, emitting gentle luster.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s world seemed to have nothing else but only Yan Ruoxue.

Beside her were Uncle Yan and Yan Yunfan. Yan Yunfan was still as arrogant as ever. He was wearing a battle suit that looked like armor. Wherever he went, he was filled with battle intent.

“Tsk tsk, Brother Qin is stunned! Aren’t you going over to say hello?” Saintess Gu’s words pulled Qin Yu back to reality.

Qin Yu came back to his senses. He immediately stood up and dashed toward Yan Ruoxue.

Since he had already offended the entire Si family, there was nothing to be afraid of. Thus he might as well declare his love openly.

“Ruoxue!” Qin Yu quickly walked up to her side, stretching out his hand, wanting to pull Yan Ruoxue into his arms. However, given the current situation, he retracted his hand.

“Qin Yu, you’re here too!” Before Yan Ruoxue could say anything, Yan Yunfan stepped forward, and a terrifying battle intent swept out!

“Buzz!”

The moment Yan Yunfan emitted the battle intent, an incredibly terrifying light emitted from the void.

This light was very oppressive as if it was warning Yan Yunfan.

Yan Yunfan glanced at it, then snorted coldly and retreated to the side.

Qin Yu could not be bothered with Yan Yunfan at all. All his thoughts were on Yan Ruoxue.

Yan Ruoxue looked around and gave Uncle Yan a look.

Although Uncle Yan was reluctant, he nodded and said, “Miss Yan, there is an old friend of mine in front. I will go and greet him.”

“Alright, alright.” Yan Ruoxue was as playful as a child, no longer as cold and elegant as before.

After Uncle Yan left, Yan Ruoxue no longer cared about Yan Yunfan. She pulled Qin Yu and ran to a tree without people around. She said excitedly, “I knew you would come!”

“Teng Zixu is so famous,” Qin Yu said with a smile. “He’s the first person to step into the True Saint realm. I also want to witness what kind of person he is.”

Yan Ruoxue patted Qin Yu Yu’s head and said half-jokingly, “You’ve changed. You look a lot more mature now.”

Qin Yu coughed dryly and said, “It’s not mature. Resorting to desperate measures is more like it.”

Hearing this, Yan Ruoxue covered her mouth and chuckled.

She held Qin Yu’s hand and whispered, “Did you really take the Traceless Immortal Scripture?”

Qin Yu naturally would not hide anything from Yan Ruoxue. He nodded and said, “Yes, I did take it away. It’s now in Thunder Courtyard.”

“You must be careful. Everyone is now eyeing the Traceless Immortal Scripture, even the Yan Family!” Yan Ruoxue whispered. “When Yan Guyun comes out of seclusion, he will definitely ask you for the Traceless Immortal Scripture!”

“It’s fine. We’ll talk about it when that day comes,” Qin Yu smiled and said.

At this point, Qin Yu seemed to have thought of something and quickly said, “Oh yes, the day of the Path of Heaven is about to come. You’ve heard the news, right?”

Yan Ruoxue’s expression turned a little gloomy when Qin Yu mentioned the day of the Path of Heaven. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Yes, the Yan family is discussing this matter now.”

“Are they really going to marry you to Si Shiyue?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.
