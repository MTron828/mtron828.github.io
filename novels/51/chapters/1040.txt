Chapter 1041: Chapter 1,041, don’t waste your energy 

Qin Yu was deep in thought as he looked at Zhai Xing who was lying on the bed.

“I understand, Xiao Qing. Thank you,”Qin Yu said.

Xiao Qing quickly waved his hand and said, “You’re welcome.”

After sending Xiao Qing away, Qin Yu wrote down another prescription and sent someone to buy medicine.

Qin Yu planned to rely on his medical skills to save Zhai Xing.

Then, Qin Yu, Jiang he, and Jiang he walked out of the room.

They came to a pavilion and sat down.

Qin Yu poured a cup of tea for Jiang he and said, “Senior Jiang he, I have an idea. I don’t know if it will work.”

“You want to rope in Zhai Xing?”Jiang he seemed to have guessed something.

Qin Yu did not hide anything and simply nodded, “Yes, after listening to Xiaoqing, I think Zhai Xing should not die for the Gu family.”

“Moreover... Zhai Xing controls the military power of the second mystic realm. With his help, it will naturally be much easier to take down the second mystic realm.”

Jiang he took a sip of tea and slowly said, “What you said is right, but the possibility of Zhai Xing rebelling against the second mystic realm is almost zero.”

“He is clearly a soft-hearted person, yet he would rather watch the Gu family act atrociously than leave. It can be imagined how loyal he is to the Gu family.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Human actions matter. Sometimes, we have to resort to extreme measures.”

Jiang he said in a low voice, “If we can succeed, it will naturally be a good thing. But if we don’t succeed? How are you going to deal with Zhai Xing?”

This was a difficult problem.

If they could not succeed, it meant that Zhai Xing would fight to the death for the Gu family.

If they wanted to take down the GU family, they had to cross this hurdle.

“If it really doesn’t work, I can only follow his wishes and kill him.”Qin Yu’s voice was a little cold.

In this regard, Jiang he could not help but sigh slightly.

“I hope you can succeed. I don’t wish for Zhai Xing to die either.”Jiang he shook his head.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “I will try my best.”

“By the way, senior, have you heard of the Yan family’s secret realm?”At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly asked.

Jiang he immediately shook his head and said, “Not to mention the Yan family’s secret realm, I don’t even know the first secret realm.”

Qin Yu sighed slightly. These things were too far away from the current martial artists. Perhaps no one knew.

“Your father should know.”At this moment, Jiang he suddenly changed the topic.

Qin Yu opened his mouth and said with a bitter smile, “Unfortunately, I also know nothing about him.”

“Don’t worry. This is a golden age. Anything is possible,”Jiang he said with a smile.

“I used to think that I would never have the chance to become a martial saint in this lifetime. Now, it has also exceeded my expectations.”

Qin Yu sighed and said, “A golden age. I wonder how many geniuses will appear in this lifetime.”

The more golden age one was in, the more intense the competition would be.

Resources were fixed, but there would be more and more geniuses.

No one knew who would be able to step over everyone and become the top expert in this life.

...

After buying the herbs, Qin Yu personally refined and consumed the herbs for Zhai Xing.

Zhai Xing was severely injured. This was a long process. It would probably take several days for him to wake up.

Qin Yu was not in a hurry. He did not take the next step toward the second mystic realm. Instead, he placed all his attention on Zhai Xing. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The news of Zhai Xing losing to Qin Yu spread quickly, and soon everyone knew about it.

This news also spread to the second mystic realm very quickly.

In the mystic realm, Gu Zizhen was really furious!

He pushed the table and smashed almost all the decorations in the hall that could be destroyed. The fierce meat on his face was trembling non-stop.

“Captured alive? How is this possible!”Gu Zizhen said angrily.

One had to know that the soul bell was a saint weapon bestowed by the higher-ups. Its power was unimaginable! It was not something a martial saint could resist!

With the soul bell in zhexing’s hand, the possibility of losing was almost zero!

“He didn’t bring him back, and the soul bell was lost...”Gu Zizhen gnashed his teeth, his face full of anger.

Long Mei, who was at the side, came forward and said with a crafty face, “Lord zhexing probably lost to Qin Yu on purpose. After all, he let Qin Yu go a few times.”

Hearing this, Gu Zizhen’s eyes suddenly turned to long mei.

“What did you say?”Gu Zizhen’s tone was somewhat cold.

Long Mei hurriedly said, “When he was at the martial arts association in Jingdu, Zhai Xing had repeatedly opposed young master. I suspect that he lost to Qin Yu on purpose! Maybe he has already betrayed us!”

Gu Zizhen’s eyes slightly narrowed. He suddenly waved his large palm, and the terrifying force instantly sent Long Mei flying!

“Who do you think you are? How dare you speak ill of Zhai Xing!”Gu Zizhen said coldly.

“Zhai Xing and I have known each other for many years. Will he rebel? He’s full of nonsense!”

Long brows spat out blood. He endured the pain and said with a terrified expression, “It’s... It’s my unprovoked guess. I hope the patriarch can forgive me...”

Gu Zizhen said coldly, “If you dare to speak nonsense again, I’ll cut off your tongue!”

“Yes, yes...”Long Mei’s face was full of fear, and he didn’t even dare to breathe loudly.

Gu Zizhen sat on the dragon chair and coldly said, “Losing a soul bell is nothing. Just let him keep it for a while.”

“Even if he has a soul bell, he’s definitely not my match.”

“Master, what should we do now?”Someone beside him asked.

Gu Zizhen said coldly, “There’s no rush. I want to see what Qin Yu will do next.”

...

On the other side, Qin Yu was refining medicine for Zhai Xing Day and night.

At the same time, he was also slowly expanding the sphere of influence of the Heaven Gate.

After a full seven days, Zhai Xing finally woke up from his coma.

The moment he opened his eyes, the first person who entered his sight was Qin Yu, who was holding the medicine.

Seeing this scene, Zhai Xing knocked the medicine out of Qin Yu’s hand. He got up and shouted angrily, “Qin Yu, why are you here? !”

Qin Yu spread his hands and said, “This is the Heaven Gate, my territory. Where else should I be if I’m not here?”

Zhai Xing’s expression immediately changed! He lowered his head to look at his body, and the expression on his face became even uglier.

“Don’t worry, I’m not interested in men,”Qin Yu said as he stood up.

Zhai Xing ignored Qin Yu’s joke. He hurriedly stood up from the bed, then clenched his fist and rushed towards Qin Yu!

However, at this moment, Zhai Xing’s body was extremely weak. Qin Yu easily dodged it.

“Don’t waste your strength. You Can’t Hurt Me Now,”Qin Yu said indifferently.

Zhai Xing gritted his teeth and said, “If you don’t kill me, I will definitely kill you!”

“Even if you want to kill me, you have to wait until your injury recovers,”Qin Yu said with a smile.

Zhai Xing narrowed his eyes and sneered, “Qin Yu, do you think I will be moved by your small favor? You are the one wasting your energy.”
