Chapter 176: One Heavy Blow! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Jiang Haoran, with disbelief written all over his face, lowered his head to look at his own fist!

Although after his father went into seclusion for the past few years, all of his attention was placed on business, and his strength had decreased, he was still a genuine Inner Strength Past Master!

In fact, Qin Yu was also a little surprised.

He knew that his physical body had become stronger, but he didn’t expect it to be so hard.

“Is there anything else? If there’s nothing else, I will leave now.” Qin Yu patted the soil on his clothes and turned around to leave.

How could Jiang Haoran give up just like that? He gritted his teeth and the energy in his body burst out again!

“Stop right there!” Jiang Haoran roared!

“Just now, I was just testing you. I’ve said before that the cultivation technique I have is enough to allow me to advance to the next level!”

After saying that, his strength began to rise rapidly! It seemed like he had used some kind of cultivation technique.

This stunned Qin Yu. He nodded and said, “Hmm, it seems pretty impressive.”

Although it was a compliment, to Jiang Haoran, it was undoubtedly an insult!

“You have the guts to look down on me? You’re courting death!” Jiang Haoran suddenly threw out a ruthless punch towards Qin Yu!

“Saintly Body Technique!” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice. A faint layer of light immediately lit up around his body!

“Clang!”

Under this punch, Qin Yu still didn’t retaliate and endured it!

And he didn’t move at all!

“With the enhancement of the Saintly Body Technique, I wonder how strong my physical body will be.” Qin Yu looked at his own chest with excitement.

Jiang Haoran’s expression was ashen and his face was full of disbelief!

“How is this possible?! How is this possible?!” Jiang Haoran was astonished!

He seemed to have gone mad and started punching Qin Yu like crazy! Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Qin Yu, however, closed his eyes with his hands behind his back and allowed Jiang Haoran to punch his body.

“Dang dang dang” sounds were incessant, and Qin Yu’s figure kept retreating.

However, Qin Yu’s physical body didn’t suffer the slightest bit of damage!

“Looks like the Jiang family’s inherited cultivation method is only so-so,” Qin Yu said with a cold smile.

Jiang Haoran panted heavily as he stared fixedly at Qin Yu.

Anger ignited in his chest, but as a levelheaded businessman, he quickly calmed down.

“You really made me look at you in a new light.” Jiang Haoran looked coldly at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “It seems that you are going to use some kind of amazing martial art.”

Jiang Haoran sneered and said, “You guessed right, but unfortunately, there is no reward!”

After saying that, Jiang Haoran slowly raised his hands.

The Inner Strength in his body surged toward his fists at an extremely fast speed.

His fists condensed into the shape of a dragon head!

“This is a cultivation technique created by my grandfather. It’s called the Divine Dragon Fist,” Jiang Haoran said coldly.

“Back then, my grandfather used the Divine Dragon Fist to kill countless people!”

“Qin Yu, you should feel honored to die under the Divine Dragon Fist fist!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Jiang Haoran punched forward!

Two divine dragons appeared on his fists!

With the enhancement of internal qi, his strength was extremely powerful!

Even Qin Yu sensed the danger!

“Die!” Jiang Haoran roared crazily, as if he could already foresee Qin Yu’s death from the punch!

Qin Yu, who wasn’t far away, finally moved.

Light blue light surrounded his hands. His hands turned into claws as he grabbed forward!

“Boom!”

With a loud sound, Qin Yu’s hands grabbed the necks of the two divine dragons!

Then, Qin Yu’s fists flashed with light.

In the next second, the two divine dragons were crushed by Qin Yu!

“How... how is this possible?!” Jiang Haoran, his eyes full of fear, took two steps back!

Qin Yu said indifferently, “This move of mine was created by my father. It’s called the Dragon Capturing Hand. It seems to be a little more powerful than your Divine Dragon Fist.”

Jiang Haoran’s expression was a bit ugly.

How could Qin Yu have such a cultivation technique?

Could it be that his father was actually a martial artist?

Even Jiang Yu, who was in the car, widened his eyes.

Although he was weak, he knew the power of the Divine Dragon Fist!

That was one of the Jiang family’s trump cards!

“Jiang Haoran, I’m tired of playing with it. You can get lost now,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Jiang Haoran wouldn’t give up. He gritted his teeth and said, “Qin Yu, if I’m not mistaken, your bullsh * t Dragon Capturing Hand has exhausted your strength, right? Currently, you are just a lamb waiting to be slaughtered!”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but scratch his head and said, “Why do you people like to blind guess?”

“Hahaha! I must be right!” Jiang Haoran laughed loudly.

“Otherwise, why would you be in such a hurry to leave?”

Qin Yu frowned.

“Jiang Haoran, don’t be so stubborn. Are you only happy if I cripple you?” Qin Yu said with a cold expression.

Jiang Haoran still didn’t care. He sneered and said, “Your physical strength has been exhausted. How will you cripple me? With your mouth? Try it if you have the ability to!”

Qin Yu’s expression gradually turned cold.

“You are really a sore loser. Well then, I will satisfy you,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Qin Yu’s fist began to gather qi.

All the spiritual power in his body gathered on Qin Yu’s fist in an instant!

“Jiang Haoran, try this punch!” Qin Yu roared angrily, and his body suddenly disappeared in the next second!

“Quite putting on an act. You don’t scare me!” Jiang Haoran roared angrily, and actually met it head-on!

But the moment the two fists collided, Jiang Haoran regretted it.

He clearly felt that this punch would probably take his life!

“Bang!”

The two fists collided, and Qin Yu’s terrifying punch sent Jiang Haoran flying!!

Half of his arm was broken, and the gust of wind from the punch sent Jiang Haoran flying!

The unparalleled force of the punch was so strong that Jiang Haoran was bleeding from the corner of his mouth, and his chest caved in, as if his internal organs were about to be shattered!

Jiang Haoran laid on the ground. He wanted to get up, but he found that his whole body was in extreme pain!

“Just one punch... and I fell...” Jiang Haoran suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood, and then his vision went black as he fainted.

He was seriously injured from one punch!

Qin Yu glanced at Jiang Yu, who was trembling in the car, and then said, “Kid, hurry up and drag your brother back. If you guys go back too late, I’m afraid you won’t be able to save him.”

Jiang Yu’s expression was ugly. His leg bone was broken, so he drove the car to Jiang Haoran with great difficulty.

Qin Yu glanced at them and didn’t say anything. He turned around and left.

In the hotel, Mr. Wu, Wei Ming, and Mr. Yang were gathered together.

Their faces were full of worry, and Mr. Wu was hesitating whether to inform Yan Ruoxue or not.

“I just received news that Jiang Haoran went to look for Qin Yu,” Wei Ming said in a deep voice.

“With Jiang Haoran’s temper, he will never let Qin Yu off the hook.”

“Most importantly, Jiang Haoran is an Inner Strength Past Master, and his strength is above Hong Wu’s!”
