2210 The Invincible Physical Body

“Get out of the way. You’re blocking our way.”

A man as strong as an iron tower stopped before Qin Yu and his group and said with ill intentions.

“Forgive us. We’ll leave now.”

Uncle Qun bowed and cupped his fists.

“Did I let you go, Old Fellow? Get lost to the side. You dare to block Ta Shan’s way!”

The burly man flew into a rage and slapped Qun Bo in his face.

Uncle Qun was sent flying ten or so feet away.

“You! You’re unreasonable! This place is big, and you can walk everywhere. Moreover, it’s not your family’s road.”

Yun Qingyun helped Uncle Qun up. She was so furious that she was about to cry.

“Oh, little girl, you look quite lively. Is this your first time here? The female cultivators who come here are all thorny. How about you accompany me tonight, and we’ll consider this matter settled!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Ta Shan smiled evilly and was about to touch Yun Qingyun.

“Stop it!”

Yun Fengqing gritted his teeth and blocked him.

“You can’t use your spiritual power! Otherwise, you will be killed directly!”

Uncle Qun’s face changed.

“Slap!”

The left side of Yun Fengqing’s face swelled from the slap, and he could not speak for a moment.

“If we’re not allowed to use spiritual power, we can only use the strength of our body.”

Qin Yu said indifferently.

He grabbed Ta Shan’s wrist. Ta Shan realized in horror that no matter how hard he tried, his wrist seemed to have been clamped, and he could not move at all.

“F*ck! You’re courting death!”

Ta Shan roared and slapped Qin Yu.

“You like to slap people, don’t you?”

Qin Yu said indifferently. Suddenly, he struck Ta Shan’s left face with lightning speed, shattering half of his face.

“Mr. Qin, under no circumstances should anyone lose their life here. It’s important to show restraint. Previously, a cultivator at the Peak of the True Saint killed someone in Solitary Cloud City and was killed immediately!”

Uncle Qun quickly stopped him.

“I know what to do.”

Qin Yu kicked out and broke one of Ta Shan’s legs.

“Alright, I’ll remember today’s humiliation. Don’t leave this Solitary Cloud City for the rest of your life if you’re capable. Otherwise, I’ll skin you alive and cut out your tendons.”

Ta Shan laughed strangely. He licked the blood on his face and shouted wildly.

“Why are you barking at me?”

Qin Yu slapped the other side of his face again.

“Kill me if you have the ability.”

Ta Shan laughed sinisterly.

“You think I don’t dare? I’m not even afraid of those at the Tribulation Transcending Stage. Why would I be afraid of someone like you?”

Qin Yu said indifferently.

He crushed Ta Shan’s other leg with one foot and punched Ta Shan’s face without hesitation.

With a fist accompanied by a thunder sound, Ta Shan’s expression instantly changed. He did not doubt his head would turn into meat paste under this punch.

“Senior, it’s my fault. Please spare my life!”

Ta Shan shouted with a face full of horror.

“I thought you were very tough.”

Qin Yu’s fist suddenly stopped before Ta Shan.

“Haha, Ta Shan is defeated?”

A young cultivator by the side laughed.

“Aiyo, Tashan has gone limp now. I thought you were tougher than this.”

A woman with a voluptuous figure burst into laughter.

Not far away, a three-man team was watching the commotion in the square.

One of the young men in white clothes whispered, “What a powerful physical body!”

“Ta Shan entered the path with his physical body, but this person effortlessly broke through it. His physical strength is indeed terrifying, but his cultivation realm is too low. After leaving Solitary Cloud City, he’s nothing.”

Another middle-aged man said with a smile.

“Moreover, according to my observations, his spiritual sense should have been severely injured. It probably will be very hard for his cultivation to advance.”

“As long as you don’t associate with evil, it has nothing to do with me.”

The young man said coldly.

“Mr. Qin, we will return to the Heavenly Cloud Continent first. We’ll meet again if fate allows.”

Uncle Qun cupped his fists and said.

“Remember to cultivate the cultivation technique I left for you all previously! I will go to the Heavenly Cloud Continent one day.”

Qin Yu sent a voice transmission to the three of them.

Three jars of pills fell into the hands of Yun Qingyun, Yun Fengqing, and Uncle Qun.

“This is the pills that I refined. Coupled with your Yun family’s Green Spirit Tree and cultivation technique, it’s sufficient for you all to advance further.

“Thank you, Senior!”

Uncle Qun’s face filled with ecstasy. Alchemists were even rarer to find in this remote galaxy.

A bottle containing hundreds of pills was enough to start a bloody storm.

Qin Yu nodded. “You were very brave when you stood before your junior sister just now. You made me not look down upon you.”

Qin Yu said to Yun Fengqing, then turned around and left.

It was at the Central Square of Solitary Cloud City.

Qin Yu came to a stall and stared at the herbs as he asked.

“How much do these Thousand-Year Soul-Condensing Grass and Thousand-Year Spirit-Gathering Flower cost?”

“They only cost ten True Saint Demonic Beast’s golden cores or the human race’s inner core. However, the human race’s inner core must be at least a fifth-grade True Saint.”

“So expensive!”

Qin Yu said with a frown. He had spent thousands of spiritual essence to advance from the first grade to the second grade. After reaching the fifth grade, he had to comprehend the way before advancing further.

And this stall owner wanted ten inner cores.

“Kid, you want to heal your soul injury? These two herbs of mine are over a thousand years old and were obtained in the sixth level of the Mystic Realm. Adding on the medicinal effects released by an alchemist of eighth grade and above, your soul injury still has a chance to recover. However, it would be difficult for your cultivation to advance further. What a pity!”

The middle-aged stall owner said with a smile.

“This person’s mental strength is actually so strong that he can see through my physical condition with a glance,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Qin Yu’s expression changed. Although this purgatory continent was in disorder, this disorder would allow many powerful people to emerge.

Just like the process of natural selection in the food chain, only the strongest would leave behind.

“Little Brother, it seems that you have some needs. Why don’t you join my team and travel together?”

A burly man at the side said.

“My name is Chang Hu.”

“I’m Qin Yu.”

“We accepted a mission this time, and we’re going to the fourth level to look for the fur of the black tiger. Although the black tiger is a Reversion Void Stage Demonic Beast, it’s a Demonic Beast living in a group. When it moves, there will be hundreds of them. If you join us, we’ll be more confident to resist the impact.”

“Little brother, I’m Wu Mei from the team. I’m good at mental attacks.”

The woman who had mocked Ta Shan earlier winked at Qin Yu.

“Why did you invite him? Forget about the strength of a second-grade True Saint.”

A young man frowned.

With an additional person, their harvest from this mission would be reduced.

“I’m happy. A person who can make Ta Shan suffer loss has indeed vented my anger. Hahaha! Feng, don’t be so stingy. At most, I won’t take the final reward and give it all to you.”

Chang Hu laughed heartily.

“Up to you.”

Feng said unhappily.

“What do you say, Little Brother? It’s best to have a team if you want to hunt Demon Beasts. In this purgatory, one person alone can’t go far. Join my team if you think I can be trusted.”

Chang Hu smiled and said.

“Alright!”

Qin Yu nodded. His divine sense was severely damaged, and he could only rely on the strength of his body. As Chang Hu had said, a team was naturally the best.
