Chapter 456: The Secrets of the Water Rhyme Tower Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu stared at the Water Rhyme Tower in the distance, and his eyes were filled with desire.

He released his divine sense and carefully walked towards the Water Rhyme Tower.

The Water Rhyme Tower was located on a distant mountain. This tower looked like it was made by nature, but it also had some traces of being man-made.

The entire tower wasn’t too tall, but it could overlook more than half of Dongchuan.

And this towering Water Rhyme Tower was Meng Wuxiong’s private property.

After nearly half an hour, Qin Yu finally walked to the bottom of the Water Rhyme Tower.

Standing in front of this tower, Qin Yu looked extremely tiny.

He raised his head to look at the Water Rhyme Tower and said with a frown, “I can’t feel a trace of spiritual energy.”

Strange, since he couldn’t feel any spiritual energy, then how did Meng Wuxiong and He Teng use this tower to cultivate?

“Could it be... that it has nothing to do with this tower?” Qin Yu frowned.

Or could it be that this Water Rhyme Tower was just a place for them to cultivate?

“Whatever, I’m already here, so I might as well go up and take a look first,” Qin Yu thought to himself. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Then, he walked into the Water Rhyme Tower.

An ancient gate blocked Qin Yu’s path.

The gate was at least five meters tall and looked extremely heavy.

Qin Yu stretched out his hand and was about to push open the gate.

However, when his hand touched the gate, a huge force suddenly surged!

Qin Yu, who was caught off guard, was instantly sent flying by this force! He took dozens of steps back before he could stabilize his body.

Qin Yu got up from the ground. He patted the soil on his body and frowned. “They actually set a taboo.”

Could it be that... only Meng Wuxiong and He Teng could enter this tower?

Qin Yu walked to the door again, circulated his spiritual power, and tried to push open the door.

The force burst out again and blocked Qin Yu’s way.

“It seems to be the case,” Qin Yu murmured in a low voice.

Since he couldn’t open the door, he could only force his way in.

But the spiritual power in Qin Yu’s body was currently depleted and he couldn’t bring out even a tenth of his full strength.

Hence, he could only sit cross-legged under the Water Rhyme Tower for the time being and slowly recover his strength.

... . .

On the other side, He Teng left Dongchuan and returned to the He family’s residence in the Central Plains on the same day.

As he stood at the airport of the He family, a cold smile appeared on He Teng’s face.

“In the entire Central Plains, I am the only half-step Martial Marquis. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that I am number one in the Central Plains.” He Teng said flatly.

That hoarse voice suddenly sounded in his mind, “Even in Pyro, there aren’t many half-step Martial Marquises... . .”

The smile on He Teng’s face grew even wider.

“From today onwards, I am the king of the Central Plains!” He Teng said with a cold laugh.

After returning home, He Teng wasn’t in a hurry to go to Chuzhou.

Instead, he had sent someone to issue a challenge on the Martial Arts Forum!

The target of this challenge was none other than Qin Yu!

“In three days, I will go to Chuzhou. I hope you are ready,” He Teng commented on the Martial Arts Forum.

Upon seeing this news, the people on the Martial Arts Forum immediately buzzed with comments!

“He Teng? The number one on the potential ranking?”

“Is the number one and number two finally going to fight?”

“What happened to Qin Yu recently? First, Hong Yi Sect issued a kill order, and then He Teng issued a challenge to him.”

“Maybe he caused public outrage.”

Countless people were discussing this matter, and some people even began to analyze the strength of the two.

“He Teng has always been the number one on the potential leaderboard. He should be able to defeat Qin Yu.”

“That’s right. Other than the geniuses of those aristocratic families, He Teng should be considered number one.”

“As the second person on the potential ranking, Qin Yu shouldn’t be too far off, right?”

No one dared to make a hasty conclusion.

In their eyes, He Teng and Qin Yu should be on par.

But at this moment, a mysterious person released a piece of important news:

“He Teng has already reached the half-step Martial Marquis Realm and defeated Ao Shuo, who is known as number one in the Central Plains.”

Following that, a video was posted on the Martial Arts Forum.

In the video, Ao Shuo tried his best and used all of his spells, but was miserably defeated.

On the other hand, He Teng wasn’t threatened by Ao Shuo.

In just one move, Ao Shuo’s ribs were broken and he fell to the ground.

The difference in strength between the two was obvious at a glance.

After this video was posted, countless people were shocked!

“He Teng has actually reached the half-step Martial Marquis realm? He’s truely creme de la creme!”

“As expected of number one on the potential ranking. His potential is beyond imagination!”

“Ao Shuo has been known as number one in the Central Plains for many years and has never suffered a defeat. Today, he actually suffered such a miserable defeat!”

“Ao Shuo was unable to retaliate in front of He Teng. It seems that He Teng has really reached the half-step Martial Marquis Realm.”

Following that, the Martial Arts Forum’s “Ranking of the Younger Generation” was finally updated.

It was the first time that He Teng had broken into this ranking and was ranked tenth.

In that case, among Pyro’s younger generation, there were at least nine people who had reached the half-step Martial Marquis realm.

This was practically an official confirmation that He Teng had really reached the half-step Martial Marquis!

“Now that He Teng is already a half-step Martial Marquis, the gap between him and Qin Yu has widened.”

“If that’s the case, Qin Yu has no chance of winning.”

“Although Qin Yu is a genius, no one can surpass the gap between an Inner Strength Grandmaster and a half-step Martial Marquis. Even Ye Qing can’t do it.”

Just now, Qin Yu and He Teng’s chances of winning were about the same, but in the blink of an eye, the evaluation became biased.

Therefore, everyone thought that Qin Yu was bound to lose.

After all, Qin Yu was only an Inner Strength Grandmaster. It was impossible for him to defeat a half-step Martial Marquis.

Seeing the news on the Martial Arts Forum, He Teng couldn’t stop laughing coldly.

“It’s about time.” He Teng put away his phone.

“We’ll set off tomorrow and head to Chuzhou.”

“Son, you... you... Why did you kill Ao Shuo?” At this moment, He Rongshou walked in from outside the door.

He Teng glanced at him and said indifferently, “Isn’t he number one in the Central Plains? Only by killing him can I replace him.”

He Rongshou gritted his teeth and said with some grief and indignation, “Ao Shuo has always regarded you as his nephew. Even if you want to establish your power, there’s no need to kill him!”

He Teng’s expression immediately turned cold.

Sensing the murderous aura from He Teng, He Rongshou couldn’t help but take two steps back.

He Teng looked at He Rongshou. A moment later, he said coldly, “I became number one in the Central Plains. Aren’t you happy? Because of me, the He family became the number one family in the Central Plains. Aren’t you happy?”

He Rongshou was immediately speechless.

That’s right. When He Rongshou forced He Teng to win glory for the He family, how could he have thought of this?

...

At this moment, Qin Yu was still sitting under the Water Rhyme Tower while slowly recovering his physical strength.

After an entire day and night, Qin Yu’s strength had only recovered 50%.

“The consumption of this Spiritual Fire Seal is too great. After only using it once, my entire body has practically sunk into a dry state.” Qin Yu frowned.

Unless it was a critical moment, he absolutely couldn’t use this Spiritual Fire Seal again.

“However... 50% of my strength should be enough to break through this door.” Qin Yu stood up from the ground.

The golden light on his body lit up at this moment. His two fists were like they were made of gold as they shone brilliantly under the sunlight.

“Let me see what secrets are hidden within this Water Rhyme Tower.” Qin Yu said coldly.
