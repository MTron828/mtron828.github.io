Granny Qin put her hands behind her back and looked indifferent.

Qin Yu looked at Granny Qin in front of him and sneered. “You want to frame me?”

“Hehe, I’m telling the truth. Do you think everyone will believe me or you?” Granny Qin said proudly.

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered to talk nonsense with her and immediately asked, “Tell me, why did you come to me in the middle of the night?”

Granny Qin’s eyes immediately narrowed. A strong killing intent burst out from her body.

“To teach you a lesson, of course!” Granny Qin said coldly.

“Teach me a lesson?” Qin Yu was a little surprised.

“What? The AO Zhan you sent didn’t work, so are you going to do it yourself now?”

Granny Qin didn’t hide anything and said indifferently, “That’s right.”

“It seems that you have no confidence in that beast you raised. You try to cripple me again and again. You’re really persistent.” Qin Yu sneered.

Granny Qin narrowed her eyes and said, “Blackie can’t lose. No one can beat him! I want to make him invincible!”

Qin Yu clapped his ears and said with a bit of ridicule, “Are you going to cripple me, or are you going to kill me?”

“I only need to injure you.” Granny Qin grinned, revealing a mouthful of yellow teeth.

Her sinister internal qi enveloped the entire mountain forest, and that strong killing intent turned into a strong wind that was like a sharp blade, cutting through people’s lives!

“You heard it, right? Recorded it?”

Just as Granny Qin was about to make her move, Qin Yu suddenly took out his phone.

The man with the mustache’s voice immediately came from the other end. “Don’t worry, it’s all recorded.”

Granny Qin’s expression instantly changed!

With a flick of her finger, she directly smashed Qin Yu’s phone.

“It’s useless. I was afraid that you would destroy my phone, so I deliberately turned on the voice chat with my friends.” Qin Yu grinned, revealing a brilliant smile.

“You’re already so old. I guess you don’t know enough about modern high-tech products, right?”

Granny Qin was instantly furious! Her face, which was full of wrinkles, was trembling non-stop!

Qin Yu looked at Granny Qin coldly and said, “If you don’t want everyone to see your face, you’d better not play any more tricks with me.”

“Otherwise, I promise to make you and that beast you raised lose your reputation!”

Granny Qin glared at Qin Yu and said through gritted teeth, “You little beast, I will tear you into pieces!”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Don’t worry, when I become a Martial Saint, you will be the first one I will kill.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and left.

Granny Qin stared at Qin Yu. Her entire body was filled with a strong killing intent.

As she watched Qin Yu leave, Granny Qin’s entire body trembled.

However, in the end, she didn’t do anything and allowed Qin Yu to leave her sight.

She had never expected that her carefully planned plan would be easily resolved.

...

The next day.

Qin Yu and the man with the mustache walked together on the main street of the martial arts academy.

“There’s a Mystic Realm ahead,” Qin Yu said, pointing at the Mystic Realm he had sensed last time.

The man with the mustache mumbled, “How did you know?”

“I can’t explain it to you right now,” Qin Yu said, waving his hand.

As they were talking, the two of them bumped into Granny Qin and Blackie.

They seemed to have come to find Qin Yu on purpose and were blocking their way.

The man with the mustache hurriedly hid behind Qin Yu with a vigilant expression.

Qin Yu, on the other hand, looked at the two of them expressionlessly.

“What’s the matter? Do you have something to do?” Qin Yu asked coldly.

Granny Qin narrowed her eyes and said, “Little b*stard, you’d better not spread the video around.”

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh.

“Why? Are you here to scout for information?” Qin Yu said with a hint of sarcasm.

Granny Qin’s expression darkened, and her skinny claws couldn’t help but clench.

Just as Qin Yu said, Granny Qin was afraid that Qin Yu would spread the video.

“Don’t worry. As long as you don’t come looking for trouble again, I guarantee that the video will not be spread,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

Blackie took a step forward, and his pitch-black eyes stared coldly at Qin Yu.

“If I win, how about you destroy the video?” Blackie asked.

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and smiled. “Of course.”

Blackie said coldly, “You’d better keep your word.”

“Don’t worry, you have no chance of winning,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

After saying this, Qin Yu and the man with the mustache were ready to leave.

“You were the one who recorded last night, right?” At this time, Granny Qin suddenly looked at the man with the mustache with a gloomy expression.

The man with the mustache’s expression darkened. He braced himself and said, “Nonsense. I went to bed early last night.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Hehe.” Granny Qin sneered.

“It’s better for you to be careful. If you follow the wrong person, it’s easy to lose your life.”

The man with the mustache coughed dryly. He thought to himself, “Since I’ve already offended her, why do I still need to be deferential to her?”

Thinking of this, the man with the mustache straightened his back and said, “Old b*stard, do you think I’m afraid of you?”

Granny Qin’s expression instantly darkened. She opened her mouth and was about to say something when her phone suddenly rang.

After the call was connected, Granny Qin immediately put on a respectful expression.

“Okay, I’ll be there right away,” Granny Qin said with a nod and a bow.

After hanging up the phone, Granny Qin pointed at Qin Yu and the man with the mustache and said coldly, “Let’s see how long you can be arrogant for.”

After saying this, Granny Qin left in a hurry.

Looking at Granny Qin’s back, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown slightly.

“There aren’t many people who can make Granny Qin so respectful. Could it be... a call from the higher-ups?” Qin Yu suddenly guessed something.

Just as Qin Yu guessed, this call was from the higher-ups.

And the content of the call was to ask Granny Qin to attend a meeting.

...

In the meeting room.

The eight higher-ups were still hidden in the darkness.

In the huge meeting room, only Granny Qin’s face could be seen.

And this time, even Xia Hang wasn’t qualified to attend the meeting, which was enough to show the importance of it.

“Welcome back, higher-ups,” Granny Qin said respectfully.

The scene was silent. After a while, someone said, “Our people have just deduced the heavenly secrets and obtained a prophecy.”

Granny Qin didn’t say anything and waited for his follow-up.

“This prophecy is related to Qin Yu.” Another voice was heard.

Granny Qin suddenly raised her head.

She said in surprise, “What... What prophecy is it?”

“According to the prophecy, a Martial Saint will appear in this world.” The voice of the higher-ups came from the dark.

Granny Qin’s expression changed and she said hurriedly, “Could it be... that Martial Saint is Qin Yu?”

“That’s right.”

“According to the prophecy, Qin Yu will become that Martial Saint.”

Granny Qin’s face instantly turned pale.

She knew very well what it meant for a Martial Saint to appear in this world.
