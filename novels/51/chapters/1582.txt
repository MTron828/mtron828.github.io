Chapter 1583: Chapter 1,583, meet the godly monarch! 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Very quickly, someone recognized Qin Yu! The radiance on his body was too powerful. Everyone knew that the Golden Radiance came from Qin Yu!

And the northern cultivators below also recognized the identities of the two godly monarchs.

Seeing the two godly monarchs, they immediately said excitedly, “It’s the godly monarch! They actually came to the South Province!”

“Haha, with The Godly Monarch making a move, that Qin Yu is nothing!”

“F * ck you! Qin Yu will definitely rip off the head of Your BULLSH * T godly monarch!”The cultivators of the southern region were not willing to be outdone and immediately cursed back.

Because of the appearance of Qin Yu and the godly monarch, the morale of the cultivators of the southern region and the northern region was greatly boosted, and a great battle was about to break out.

Above them, Qin Yu was trembling slightly due to his anger.

The internal Qi on his body was even more terrifying!

Such an internal Qi made even the two godly monarchs sigh.

“Your strength is above the eternal limit,”one of the godly monarchs commented.

“No wonder Sima Bei wanted to get rid of you,”the other godly monarch said indifferently.

Qin Yu looked at the two of them coldly and said, “I also want to experience your so-called godly monarch... you actually used such a heavy hand against absolute dance. I... Will definitely not let you off!”

After an explosive shout, Qin Yu took the initiative to attack. His hand clenched into a golden fist and instantly smashed towards the two of them!

The godly monarch raised his arm and placed it horizontally in front of him, allowing Qin Yu’s fist to smash onto his body.

“Boom!”

After a loud sound, the godly monarch immediately took a few steps back. His arm was in pain.

He looked at his arm in surprise. “You can actually hurt me?”

With that said, the godly monarch looked at the other godly monarch and said, “Move aside. As a godly monarch of the northern lands, we have to fight two against one to deal with a junior. Isn’t that a joke?”

The other godly monarch nodded slightly and immediately retreated to the side.

At that moment, Qin Yu had already thrown a second punch!

The absolute beginning sacred fist exploded with an extremely powerful radiance on Qin Yu’s fist. He had activated the fifth level of the fighting word formula. His fist smashed over densely like raindrops!

And the godly monarch was not in a hurry to attack. He just kept using his palm to meet the attack.

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu had already thrown out hundreds of punches!

“Hehe, your strength is indeed not bad, but compared to us...”

“Bang!”

Before the godly monarch could finish his words, Qin Yu’s ten thousand spell breaking punch had already smashed over!

That Golden Radiance shot through the sky, and all the dark clouds dispersed at this moment!

A terrifying power exploded on the godly monarch’s palm. With the support of the fifth level of the fighting word formula, Qin Yu’s strength was incomparably terrifying!

The Godly King, who was caught off guard, was instantly smashed into half by a punch. The remaining power even forced him back a few steps!

Seeing this scene, all the southern province cultivators below shouted excitedly!

“Did you see that? ! Your Godly King was beaten up by our Southern Province Qin Yu!”

“Haha, he didn’t even have the strength to fight back. Now, he even smashed a palm!”

“The South Prefecture will definitely win! Qin Yu will definitely win!”

The shouts from below entered Qin Yu’s ears, but Qin Yu was extremely fearful.

This was because only he knew how terrifying the power of this fist was.

With the fifth level of the fighting word formula, the ten thousand spell breaking punch had only shattered one of his palms. This was enough to show how terrifying the abilities of the godly monarch of the northern lands were!

The godly monarch looked at his bloody palm and a hint of coldness appeared on his face. He felt a little angry deep down in his heart.

“You actually managed to injure me. You are indeed worthy of being the elite of the Southern Prefecture,”said the godly monarch coldly.

Qin Yu did not say a word. He adjusted his internal Qi to the maximum and was ready to attack at any moment.

“I have really underestimated you. Your abilities have surprised me.”The godly monarch’s tone turned colder.

In the next second, his figure suddenly disappeared. In the blink of an eye, he appeared in front of Qin Yu!

Qin Yu was greatly alarmed. He immediately stepped on the line word formula and shot backward. At the same time, Qin Yu raised his large palm and struck out with a mark! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The godly monarch seemed to have been angered. Facing Qin Yu’s mark, he punched out and instantly shattered it.

In an instant, streams of black radiance erupted from his palm. The radiance was densely packed and condensed into a huge hand. Then, it lashed out directly at Qin Yu’s body!

In front of this huge black hand, Qin Yu’s figure appeared extremely tiny.

Facing such a top-notch expert, Qin Yu did not dare to hide any of his strength. In an instant, he used his cosmic form and his huge body shot straight into the sky!

At the same time, Qin Yu clenched his fist, and his fist, which was like a small mountain, met the black palm!

Boom

At the instant of the collision, the surrounding area turned into nothingness!

The hard mountain range was like a piece of paper, instantly shattered, and everything in front of him was shifted to flat ground!

The cultivators of both sides who were fighting below were directly wiped out at this moment, and not even their ashes were left behind!

Qin Yu’s huge body took two steps back. His palm felt pain, and the radiance surrounding his fist was showing signs of breaking.

“As expected of the godly king of the northern lands...”Qin Yu murmured. Ever since he stepped into the holy region, he had never seen such a terrifying opponent!

“You really have some ability,”the godly king said coldly.

Qin Yu panted slightly, and his eyes became more vigilant.

No wonder they were able to severely injure Jue Wu. Such ability was truly shocking.

“Then, how are you going to withstand this move?”The godly monarch raised his head to look at Qin Yu, his eyes filled with ridicule.

He narrowed his eyes slightly and used the same trick again. His large black hand turned into a black claw and clawed fiercely at Qin Yu!

Qin Yu felt an unprecedented crisis in this black claw. His expression changed drastically. Without thinking, he directly unleashed the venerable fifth mountain!

The massive mountain body came crashing down like a meteorite from outer space, ruthlessly pressing down on the godly monarch!

The Black Claw suddenly changed its direction at this moment, ruthlessly grabbing towards the venerable fifth mountain!

The large hand grabbed the venerable fifth mountain, and in the next second, the large hand emitted an extremely powerful black radiance. He actually wanted to crush the venerable fifth mountain!

Qin Yu’s expression was horrified. One had to know that the venerable fifth mountain had repeatedly saved Qin Yu in the midst of fire and water, but he had never encountered such a scene!

The large hand continued to exert force. The venerable fifth mountain trembled incessantly in his hand, but there were no signs of shattering.

The godly king seemed to have sensed that he could not crush the mountain, so he threw it at Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly as he hurriedly shot backward.

“Boom!”

The gigantic mountain crashed heavily onto the ground. Before Qin Yu could even catch his breath, the palm grabbed at him once again!

Qin Yu clenched his fists. With a roar, he struck out with his ten thousand spell breaking punch once again. A simple and violent force was directed at the large Black Hand!
