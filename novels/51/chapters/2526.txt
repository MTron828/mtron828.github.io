2527 Demon Flame Mountain Range

Ji Yue giggled and said. She then patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and kissed lightly on his face.

In an instant, Qin Yu felt a terrifying killing intent coming from his back.

The feeling of being moved to tears just now instantly disappeared. Qin Yu dodged like a mouse.

He awkwardly walked up to Yan Ruoxue, trying to please her, and took her hand.

Looking at the couple throwing tantrums, Ji Yue could not help but smile.

“Alright, let’s get down to business. Even though we are going to purgatory voluntarily, almost 50% of the people plan to go along. This time, there are nearly 6,000 people.”

“So many people?”

Qin Yu was somewhat shocked.

Although the higher-ups of the alien race were injured, regardless of the demon race or the monster race, the strength below their leadership remained formidable. Moreover, this was a human race expedition, and the danger was still relatively high. He did not expect so many people to volunteer to set off.

“In war, once it begins, it’s a fight to the death, no quarter given. Almost all these warriors here had their family, friends, or close friends die at the hands of the alien race. Those who survived naturally wouldn’t let this go, and the same for the alien race.”

Ji Yue shook her head.

In the past, wars often sparked off by a tiny spark, and as they spread, they gradually evolved into relentless and endless conflicts.

This was the surging trend. Even a sixth-level Saint could not stop this hatred.

The people ready to set off had assembled. Their faces bore an indifference that seemed to disregard matters of life and death.

Qin Yu sighed lightly. Nearly a hundred Spatial Magic Artifacts lit up and rushed toward Sky City.

There were two large-scale teleportation formations near Huaning Mountain, one in Thunder Courtyard and the other in Sky City.

Thunder Courtyard had already formed a grudge against Qin Yu. As at least three Saints were guarding in Sky City, they were unafraid of anyone playing tricks.

“Ruoxue, how many people can your current Sumeru World accommodate in one go?”

Qin Yu asked somewhat curiously.

“If it’s for a short period, it should be able to accommodate 1,500 people. However, if we travel for a long time, 500 people is the limit. There is still a huge gap between us and Immortal Crane’s Ni Temple of Heaven.”

Yan Ruoxue shook her head. Previously, Qin Yu had the Green Spirit Tree to absorb spiritual energy.

But now, the Green Spirit Tree had already taken root in Human Race Watch. Yan Ruoxue was required to perfect the rules of this ring further to allow people’s cultivation for a long time.

“However, this ring has been of great help to me. I have experimented my many ideas here, including the previous spatial deduction. If I can find a way to avoid the surveillance of the Path of Heaven, my strength will increase further significantly.”

Yan Ruoxue said with some distress. Her ability to create a world within a world was like creating her own world in the vast universe.

Moreover, according to Qin Yu’s observations, this power of rules was reshaping Yan Ruoxue’s Way of Space.

Qin Yu once used the power of the soul to trigger the sea of the Spatial Path of Heaven but was weakened nearly by half in the Sumeru World.

In other words, if Yan Ruoxue could create a more complete way in the Sumeru World and extend it to the outside world, she would be almost unrivaled.

It took them about five days to reach Sky City.

Other than them, there were also numerous spatial treasures traversing the sky, all of which were the people from the human race who had gone to various regions to fight.

The efficiency of the human race was astonishing.

Upon learning about the injuries of the higher-ups of the alien race, the three major human race guilds, Heavenly Dipper Palace, Dragon Roamer Guild, and Dragon Knights, had already issued nearly 100,000 bounty missions.

These did not only involve ventures into the mystic realm but also the Alchemist Association’s purchasing requests for various spiritual herbs, many located deep within purgatory.

At this moment, the Alchemist Association offered an astonishing reward, driving countless cultivators into a frenzy.

Whether driven by personal gain or for the greater cause of the human race, the entire human race had begun to mobilize.

Therefore, Qin Yu and the others were not particularly eye-catching. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

After going through a series of familiar teleporting processes, all the people from Human Race Watch were finally teleported to Solitary Cloud City. At this moment, the air around the vast Lonely Cloud City was full of a strong smell of blood.

Solitary Cloud City was densely packed with people by now. Not only in the city but many human cultivators were stationed outside the city.

“Sect Master, what should we do next? I’m thinking of bringing the Gu family members to clean up. Many cultivators of the Gu family haven’t come into contact with the real battles. This time, we must let them get used to this kind of danger.”

A graceful figure walked over. It was Gu Wanqing.

She was one of Gu Ning’s two personal disciples and was considered the most powerful person in the Gu family.

Even the Supreme Elders of the Gu family regarded her as the head of the Gu family, and she held high authority in the Gu family.

“Let’s act together. According to the intelligence from the Moon-Listening Pavilion, a large number of monster race troops are patrolling nearby even if the high-level warriors of the alien race won’t attack. The Gu family mainly cultivates the Way of Water, and their attack power is still weak. After we have investigated the surrounding environment, you may leave if you want to.”

Qin Yu shook his head and rejected.

Gu Wanqing frowned slightly and wanted to say something but cupped her fists in the end.

“She seems a little unhappy. Why don’t we let her do it if she wants to leave?”

Yan Ruoxue asked, somewhat puzzled.

“If the Gu family encounters a large group of six-winged army, other than a few people, the rest probably won’t survive. I’ve promised the seniors, Yan Minglong and Jiang Qingyuan, that I’ll take good care of the members of the Gu family. It’s not appropriate for them to leave just like that.”

Qin Yu sighed. Despite Gu Ning’s scheming against him, he could not bring himself to hate her.

Especially with Saintess Gu’s departure, he felt a sense of regret toward the Gu family instead.

“Elder Guai, is there a suitable place for us to train nearby?”

For the past few days, Elder Guai had been studying the bounty notices of the major guilds together with the intelligence from Ji Yue.

He should be more familiar with the area. He stroked his beard and said.

“The passage between purgatory and the monster realm is now connected. A passage in the sixth level of purgatory connects to the Demon Flame Mountain Range in the monster realm. These mountains emit scorching demonic flames all year round, housing fire demons and demonic beasts of flame, posing extreme danger. However, it so happens that the Gu family’s cultivation methods can restrain these demonic beasts, so this is a more suitable place.”

“Alright, let’s head to this area.”

Qin Yu no longer hesitated. He was going to train the cultivators of Human Race Watch and study the power of the Brilliance of Stars and Moon.

After witnessing the combined attack of Demon King Xiang Yu and the eight-winged monster race army, Qin Yu thought that it would undoubtedly be a tremendous force in battle if such power could be applied to the human race.
