2000 Mysterious Skeleton

Looking at Qin Yu approaching step by step, the third princess was so frightened that her entire body trembled.

“Don’t you like to look at appearance? I’ll destroy your face then,” Qin Yu said coldly.

After saying that, his palm emitted a golden light. He was preparing to leave an indelible mark on the third princess’s face.

“No… Don’t…” The third princess was so frightened that her entire body trembled, and her face was full of tears.

However, Qin Yu did not care at all. His palm was getting closer and closer, and its blazing temperature dried up the tears on the third princess’s face.

“I beg you. I won’t dare to do it again. Let me go! Please let me go! Boohoo…” The third princess was so scared that she almost peed her pants. Her eyes were full of tears.

Just as the palm was about to land on her face, Qin Yu moved his hand away.

Qin Yu actually did not want to hurt the third princess. He only wanted to scare her.

If he really left a mark on her face, he probably would have no chance to ease his relationship with the Yan family in the future.

“Let’s go find something to eat.” Jue Wu patted her stomach which was rumbling with hunger.

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. It was a forest here, so there would be wild beasts around. Therefore, finding food was not a big problem.

While Qin Yu was on the run, some major thing happened in Sky City.

Elder Si brought his people back to Sky City. The other aristocratic families didn’t care about this matter. They just wanted to send the prince to a safe and restricted area.

In the Great Hall, Elder Yao stood up and said, “We have chosen a place for Your Highness. It is a place with the sounds and scents of nature. The nine aristocratic families have joined forces to set up a formation. It is very safe.”

The prince knew he had no right to choose, so he did not say anything.

“Also, Qin Yu abducted the third princess of the Yan family. This shows his evil intentions. We must get rid of such a person as soon as possible,” Elder Yao continued.

“A mere Qin Yu, there’s no need to make such a big fuss,” someone said.

“That’s right. It’s not difficult to kill him.”

“Why don’t we let your Yao family take action?”

Elder Yao smiled and said, “Since everyone opined the same, I certainly agree. It’s just that I’ll have to trouble everyone. If you see Qin Yu, please let us know. ”

Everyone nodded slightly and reached a consensus.

The meeting ended. They naturally planned to leave with the prince.

They gave the prince three days to do his packing. After three days, they would leave on time.

The destination was called Peach Blossom Island. It was a small floating island surrounded by endless black water. Although it was called Peach Blossom Island, it was actually no different from Xihunag Island.

The news that Qin Yu had abducted the third princess of the Yan family soon spread throughout the entire Zhongzhou, even the entire Holy Region.

It was not an exaggeration to say this matter was as explosive as the mysterious demon race killing the heirs back then.

It had been many years since someone had dared to make a move against the nine great aristocratic families. But during this time, their prestige had been challenged repeatedly. It was hard not to make people feel suspicious.

“Have you heard the news? Qin Yu and Jue Wu abducted the third princess of the Yan family. Rumor has it that they have long disliked her! ”

“Nonsense! Clearly, it’s Qin Yu who is related to that mysterious person of the demon race. This is Qin Yu’s proof of allegiance!”

“I heard that Qin Yu has always had a relationship with the demon race. He came from the depths of the Azure Rock Forest. This action is to eradicate the nine great aristocratic families and replace them!”

“You’re wrong. It’s not the nine great aristocratic families they’re going to eradicate, but our human race. The demon race in the depths of the Azure Rock Forest is about to be born!”

The more the news spread, the more mysterious it became. Soon, the entire Holy Region was in a state of panic. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

In the Yan family, Yan Ruoxue felt uneasy after learning about this.

There was no other reason than the family head doted on the third princess so much. It was due to this that the third princess became arrogant and despotic.

On Mount Donghuang, Uncle Yan said in a deep voice, “The family head has sent people to kill Qin Yu.”

Yan Ruoxue’s expression suddenly changed. She looked at Uncle Yan and exclaimed, “Who did he send?”

“Yan Guyun,” Uncle Yan said.

Yan Ruoxue’s face turned even uglier when she heard that.

Yan Guyun was one of the most trusted persons by the family head. He also assisted the family head of this generation in growing up. As long as the family head instructed, he could kill anyone in the world!

His strength was a mystery. Rumors were saying he had already stepped into the True Saint cultivation realm!

The fact that the family head had sent Yan Guyun was enough to show his determination!

“Uncle Yan.” Yan Ruoxue frowned.

“Do you have the confidence to defeat Yan Guyun?”

Uncle Yan looked at Yan Ruoxue and said in a deep voice, “Miss Yan, I know what you’re thinking, but I advise you not to interfere in this matter anymore.”

Yan Ruoxue was silent. She knew this matter was not within her control.

“If the third princess returns safely to the Yan family, there is still room for negotiation. At that time, we can plead for mercy together, and the family head might spare him,” Uncle Yan continued.

“But if anything happens to the third princess, no one can protect him.”

“Qin Yu won’t hurt her,” Yan Ruoxue said. “I’m just worried Yan Guyun will kill Qin Yu.”

At this moment, Yan Ruoxue raised her head and looked at Uncle Yan again.

Her eyes were full of pleading and hope. For a moment, even Uncle Yan couldn’t bear it.

“Alright, I promise you,” he sighed slightly and said.

“Thank you. I will always remember your kindness.” Yan Ruoxue bowed deeply to Uncle Yan.

Uncle Yan shook his head and said, “I can only do my best. As for whether I can stop Yan Guyun, it all depends on fate.”

…

...

The Yan family wasn’t the only one who made a move. The Yao Family also sent people at the same time.

They were in control of Qin Yu’s internal qi, so it was only a matter of time before they could find him.

Although the other aristocratic families did not express their stance, their pursuit of that mysterious person never stopped. Now that Qin Yu had been identified as an accomplice to the mysterious person, they would probably not show mercy if they found him.

At this moment, Qin Yu and Jue Wu found a house in the barren mountain.

This house was incredibly simple and crude, and covered in dust. It was obvious that no one had been here for a long time.

“How can there be a house in this wilderness?” Qin Yu could not help but frown.

Jue Wu didn’t think much about it. She muttered, “Why do you care so much? Let’s go in and see if there’s anything to eat.”

With that, Jue Wu pushed open the door.

The moment the door opened, the first thing that entered her eyes was a complete skeleton.

The skeleton sat cross-legged as if it was cultivating.

“Hmm? Bones?” When Qin Yu saw this, he could not help but feel somewhat surprised.

...

It was really puzzling that a skeleton of a cultivator had appeared in such a place.

Qin Yu walked forward. He tried to reach out his hand and placed it on the skeleton.

But the moment he touched it, the skeleton emitted rays of light.
