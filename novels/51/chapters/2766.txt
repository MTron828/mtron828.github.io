Chapter 2767: The Nine Nether Cliff

Qin Yu recalled that he had previously asked Wang Da to look for news about Dean Lei, Flower Granny, and the others.

Moreover, he had asked Qin Yu to meet him three days ago. He reckoned that there was some progress.

Hopefully, there was news!

Qin Yu smiled bitterly. It was hard for him to find Peak Master Zhan Pu, but they had to undergo another trial after the battle at the Demon Sealing Valley.

Recalling the torture that the peak master had suffered previously, Qin Yu still felt bitter in his heart.

Qin Yu put his messy thoughts away before he rushed to Lingxu City’s trading market.

“Boss Qin Yu, you’re here!”

Not long after he entered the trading market, Wang Da sneakily appeared behind him.

“F*ck! How many people do you have here? It feels like you know immediately every time I come.”

Qin Yu was shocked by his efficiency.

When he entered this place, he specially activated the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze.

Moreover, he was sure that no one was paying attention to him. He did not expect Wang Da to see him immediately.

“That’s why ordinary people can sometimes play an unexpected role.”

Wang Da chuckled.

“By the way, you asked me to look for you previously. Is there any progress on the matter I entrusted you?”

“That’s right, but it might not be good news for you.”

Wang Da suddenly became spirited. He took out a piece of paper and drew a rough portrait on it.

There were some changes to the portrait’s hairstyle. She had thick lips, watermelon hair, and her signature toothy smile.

Although the drawing was sloppy, Qin Yu’s heart still sped up.

Wasn’t this person Chang Mang that idiot?

“Where is he?”

“You can ask anyone about this fellow. He can be considered popular. When he had ascended the stairway to heaven, his violent combat power had attracted the various major powers’ attraction. In the end, he joined the Guardian of Order. During his development, he had been favored by the higher-ups of the Guardian of Order due to his terrifying potential. He had become one of the four leaders. He’s now one of the top three leaders. He also has the Boundless Heart of Saint Kingdom. His combat strength is extremely terrifying in the guild, but he likes to cause trouble.”

“It’s Chang Mang!”

Qin Yu clenched his fists excitedly.

“Boss Qin Yu, your incident in the Endless Mine has already spread. It’s not the best time to look for him now. He has joined the Guardian of Order, so he’s likely to attack you. I heard that this person is an undying cockroach and I think he’s more powerful than Gu Ying.” Wang Da warned cautiously.

“Thank you. Do you know where he is?”

Qin Yu tossed over a bag of Grade 3 ores.

“There’s no need for so much, Boss Qin Yu. He’s usually in the Nine Nether Cliff. That’s the most chaotic place in the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom. Many people who have awakened their peak powers are there. The madman should be looking for an opponent there.”

Wang Da took the bag and pushed half of it back to Qin Yu.

Then, he took out a map of Nine Nether Cliff and gave it to Qin Yu. The location was relatively far from Lingxu City.

It was unrealistic to rely on physical strength to travel, so he had to rely on flying tools.

“Keep it and continue to help me check the information of the others. Thank you!”

Qin Yu kept the map.

“Chang Mang!”Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

He clenched his fists.

“I’ve finally found this brainless fellow!”

Furthermore, according to Wang Da’s information, Chang Mang should be even more powerful than him now. He had even become one of the leaders of the Guardian of Order.

However, this guy probably didn’t care about this thing. He might be using their power to look for enemies everywhere.

Qin Yu smiled.

Qin Yu hesitated for a moment. He wanted to bid farewell to Cang Yunzi.

However, he decided to leave after thinking about it.

They had met by chance. If they were fated, they would naturally meet again.

Moreover, meeting Cang Yunzi would cause him trouble with his current identity.

“Qin Yu has left. Do we need to send someone to keep an eye on him?”

In the luxurious hall that Qin Yu had been to previously, a person came in and knelt on one knee.

“Where is he going?”

The person in the main seat of the hall let out a muffled sound.

“According to the location of the speedboat, he should be heading to Nine Nether Cliff. However, I don’t know if he will leave halfway.”

“Send his information to the Guardian of Order and the Path of Heaven Academy. There may be higher-ups on both sides. There’s no need for anything else. It’s a pity he didn’t awaken the peak power after coming out from Heavenly Sin. He has wasted such a heaven-defying opportunity.”

“It can only be said that his luck is extremely good, but his talent is extremely low. If he can awaken his peak power in the place, then he must be a top Holy Consciousness expert. Our Lingxu City’s City Lord Mansion can give him a hand. Evervthing is iust emDtv talk now.”

A voice sounded from the side.

“Roger!”

The person who came in slowly left.

At this moment, Qin Yu had already boarded the speedboat. It was a huge ship in the air.

A huge air levitation inscription was engraved on it. The entire ship was made of very light materials.

The flight route would follow the detected airflow, so the cost was not expensive.

A hundred grade 3 ores were enough to reach the Nine Nether City.

He would need nearly 50,000 pieces of grade 3 ores if he used a teleportation formation.

The current Qin Yu could not afford it.

“Boss, when shall we arrive?”

Qin Yu looked at the boss who was controlling the sails.

“About half a month. If everything goes well, we might be able to bring it forward by two to three days. However, the power of the Holy Region is in disorder now and the Saint Power is also very thin. This is almost the thinnest holy energy since the Dao Mystical Saint promoted. The news from the Endless Mine also says that the mining rate of crystals is decreasing. I’m afraid there’s going to be chaos.”

A middle-aged man with slightly graying sideburns said with a bitter smile.

“Boss, your information source is a little inefficient. You aren’t even clear about this thing.”

A drunk young man said with a smile. His voice was a little knotted.

“What do you know? What else do you do other than drink all day?” The boss seemed to know the young man and did not give him a good look.

“Sigh! Then I have to tell you something. The Guardian of Order has also spread the news that a powerful person has been stealing the Hearts of Saint Kingdom. He kept stealing the power to another Saint Kingdom. That’s why our Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom’s Saint Power is so thin now. I know a few friends at level 6 and they say that their cultivation speed has been greatly affected!”

The young man suddenly revealed an excited expression as if he was provoked since he had been underestimated.

“Did you say that you have friends at level 6 Dao Consciousness? Are you sure they aren’t at level 6 Human Consciousness?”

The boss laughed.

“Hmph, you old fart! Don’t you believe me! This guy is almost invincible.. He’s not inferior even to the holy daughter!”
