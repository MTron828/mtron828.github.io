As Qin Yu’s body grew larger, the chains on his body also became thicker and brighter! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

No matter how much strength Qin Yu possessed, he was still unable to break free!

Qin Yu’s brows were tightly furrowed. He watched helplessly as his body headed towards the judge!

This technique had some similarities with the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s sect master’s technique. However, compared to it, this technique was even more vicious!

Everyone was staring intently at Qin Yu. They could not help but sweat, and their hearts were somewhat flustered.

“Qin Yu!”

Xiao Hai also noticed this scene. He shouted loudly, and his palm suddenly struck out, forcing Baro and Feng Hai, who were currently entangled, to retreat. Then, he immediately shot towards Yongji!

“Boom!”

Xiao Hai’s huge palm struck out, and a terrifying palm imprint headed straight for Yong Ji!

Yong Ji’s expression changed, and he hurriedly retreated. However, he was still shaken by Yong Ji’s remaining power, and he couldn’t stop vomiting blood!

“Yong Ji, Stop Right Now!”Xiao Hai said coldly.

Yong Ji wiped the blood at the corner of his mouth, and said with a cold smile, “I said, once this technique is used, there will be no rest! Even if you kill me, Qin Yu will die today!”

Seeing that Qin Yu was getting closer and closer to the judge, his huge body seemed to be dragged into the abyss!

......

At this moment, Qin Yu was incomparably calm.

His torch-like gaze looked straight at the judge, and then with a roar, his golden fist was like a small mountain, ruthlessly smashing towards the judge!

Qin Yu actually wanted to use brute force to directly disperse this technique!

His body was on par with the judge’s. At a glance, his aura was full of vigor!

Under the reinforcement of the Wuji cosmic form, Qin Yu’s fist was even more terrifying.

That golden light streaked across the sky, and then ruthlessly smashed onto the judge’s body.

“Boom!”

A loud bang exploded in that instant. The judge’s huge body was actually forced back by Qin Yu by several hundred meters!

“It really works.”

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu sneered again and again.

Meanwhile, Yong Ji widened his eyes. He had never known that this technique actually had such a way to break it!

“Hahaha, well done!”Xiao Hai couldn’t help but laugh and praise!

Then, Xiao Hai looked at Baro and Feng Hai coldly and shouted, “You two should also die!”

Feng Hai and Baro’s faces were a little ugly. The two of them were not Xiao Hai’s match at all!

“Xiao Hai, you have guts, but the invasion of the north is inevitable. You Can’t Stop It!”Feng Hai said coldly.

Then, his body began to disappear into the darkness and disappeared without a trace in the blink of an eye!

After a while, the two of them appeared on the other side of the shore.

Xiao Hai could not help but clench his fists and said coldly, “They ran away again.”

In the air, Qin Yu grabbed the chain that was tied to his body and pulled the judge over!

At the same time, another fist was clenched and suddenly smashed down.

“Boom!”

An explosion sounded. The judge was almost broken by Qin Yu!

Qin Yu grabbed the chain with one hand and kept smashing his right fist.

One punch, two punches, three punches!

After three punches, the judge finally couldn’t take it anymore and began to shatter!

His huge body turned into pieces and disappeared into the void.

At the same time, the chain on Qin Yu’s body also began to slowly disappear.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but let out a sigh of relief in his heart.

“It seems that this technique is still far inferior to the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s sect master’s Rashomon sect,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

The Rashomon sect was unfathomable. Even absolute dance could not find a way to break it.

After that, Qin Yu’s body slowly returned to normal. He walked toward Xiao Hai, cupped his hands, and asked, “Senior Xiao Hai, are you alright?”

Xiao Hai laughed heartily and said, “What can happen to me? With just them, they can’t do anything to me.”

Having said that, Xiao Hai withdrew his hand that was protecting everyone and said, “Qin Yu, it’s fortunate that you came in time. Otherwise, we would have suffered heavy losses today.”

Qin Yu looked at the people behind him and could not help but sigh, “They can’t do anything even if they came. It’s better to let them go back.”

Xiao Hai sighed slightly and said, “They came on their own. Although they are not strong enough, their spirit is commendable.”

Speaking up to this point, Xiao Hai looked at Qin Yu and said seriously, “Spirit is very important.”

Qin Yu was stunned, but he smiled bitterly in his heart.

“Once an all-out war starts, we won’t be able to stop anything. There are more than a million people in the northern lands. No matter how strong we are, it’s impossible for us to kill everyone,”Xiao Hai continued.

“Therefore, the more people in the northern lands who participate in the war, the better.”

Qin Yu grunted and said, “Senior Xiao Hai, I understand.”

Then, Qin Yu followed Xiao Hai all the way to the room.

“I really didn’t expect that you could already defeat Yongji in such a short time, and it was so easy,”Xiao Hai said with a sigh.

He said half-jokingly and half-seriously, “Even I might not be your match.”

Qin Yu waved his hand repeatedly and said, “I’m still far from senior Xiao Hai. Moreover, I relied on the augmentation of spells to be able to defeat Yongji so easily.”

If it wasn’t for the fifth level of the fighting word formula, it would have been a tough battle today.

After all, Yong Ji’s strength was also extremely powerful.

“A spell is also a type of strength,”Xiao Hai said.

At this time, he suddenly changed the topic and said, “Oh right, how is Jue Wu? Has Her injury recovered?”

Qin Yu was stunned and hurriedly said, “Jue Wu is injured?”

Xiao Hai nodded slightly and said, “Last time, she fought with one of Sima Bei’s clones. Although she cut off Sima Bei’s distraction, she was also hit in the chest.”

Qin Yu frowned and shook his head, “She doesn’t seem to be hurt.”

“Sigh.”Xiao hai sighed, “Jue Wu’s strength shouldn’t be like this. I don’t know why, but last time, she was suddenly in a trance and was hit by Sima Bei’s palm. She was seriously injured.”

Qin Yu immediately understood that it was probably the consequences of the Nirvana body.

Qin Yu didn’t have a clear understanding of Jue Wu’s strength, but according to his guess, Jue Wu’s strength was definitely above Yongji and the others.

“Senior Xiao Hai, how is the current battle situation?”Qin Yu asked.

Xiao Hai shook his head and said, “It’s not optimistic. Just as you saw, they can leave the South Province at any time, but we have no way.”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Didn’t you say that the Dead River is slowly disappearing?”

“That’s right.”Xiao Hai nodded.

“But at the current speed, I’m afraid it will take another 30 to 50 years.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but gasp and exclaimed, “30 to 50 years? So Slow?”

“Yes.”Xiao Hai nodded slightly. “And at that time, the western ridge may also participate in the war and encroach on the South Province.”

Qin Yu was silent. A moment later, he asked, “Don’t you have any countermeasures?”

Xiao Hai took a deep breath. He looked at Qin Yu and said, “Yes, we have pulled the southern region and the northern people together to forcefully speed up the Progress!”
