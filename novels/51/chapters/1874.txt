1875 Meeting Zhao Wan’er Again

At this moment, Qin Yu could only hope that he would not be noticed by the Si family.

However, this was simply impossible. Si Shiyue was well-known in Zhongzhou, and everyone knew that his powerful physique made him one of the most powerful people of the younger generation in the entire Holy Region.

If Qin Yu won first place in the competition of Thunder Courtyard, other families would definitely notice him.

“Sigh, it’s so difficult.” Qin Yu could not help but rub his head, feeling a little headache.

It seemed like he couldn’t keep his promise to Yan Ruoxue.

The peak master did not seem to understand Qin Yu’s attitude, but he did not say anything. After all, in the eyes of the peak master, Qin Yu’s background was not ordinary. He was a person who even the dean was willing to open the back door for.

The group of people hurried toward the first main peak.

Along the way, Qin Yu also saw many people from the other main peaks.

Demon-slaying Peak was the most battle-hungry main peak among the other main peaks, so it was quite famous among the other main peaks.

When many people saw Qin Yu and the others, they couldn’t help but look over.

“Qin Yu, we’ll have to rely on you this time.” Someone joked.

“That’s right. Jiu Xiao has been participating every year. This time, he’s giving you the chance. You have to do well.”

Qin Yu was a little worried at first, but after hearing their words, he patted his chest and said, “First place, I must be first!”

His words made the people around him burst into laughter.

Although they were not worried about Qin Yu’s strength, they did not really expect him to get first place. It would be good enough if he could get into the top three.

Soon, they arrived at the first main peak.

There was a huge space floating above the first main peak. It was said that this was a Mystic Realm built by Dean Lei himself, and several Saint Weapons were used to stabilize the stability of the Mystic Realm.

Even the demon-slaying Peak’s martial arts discussion hall couldn’t be compared to this Mystic Realm.

Rays of light lit up and the entrance opened.

Qin Yu and the others did not waste any time and quickly stepped into the Mystic Realm.

After entering the Mystic Realm, Qin Yu was surprised to find that this Mystic Realm was many times stronger than the Martial Arts Hall.

Compared to the shoddy Martial Arts Hall, this was a genuine small world.

There were mountains, rivers, and a celestial aura lingering around it. It was almost no different from the outside world.

At this time, many people had already arrived at the Mystic Realm. The people from the eight main peaks took their seats.

Some of them were sitting on stone stools, some were floating in the air, and some were standing on a mountain peak, watching quietly.

Qin Yu glanced around and found a floating place in front of him. There were several elders and the dean sitting in the middle.

These elders were all extremely powerful. Even Qin Yu could not see through their realms.

“Those are the lecturers and elders of Thunder Courtyard and the peak masters of the main peaks.” The peak master explained.

Qin Yu frowned and said with surprise, “Then why don’t you go over and sit?”

The peak master’s face turned red. “I don’t have that right. Although I am the peak master of Demon-slaying Peak, I am still inexperienced. At that time, we were only allowed to run ourselves because we didn’t have enough manpower.”

Qin Yu suddenly realized.

It made sense. Although the peak master was not weak, he was not strong either. At least, he could not be in the top eight of Thunder Courtyard.

Compared to the few elders sitting in the void, the peak master was indeed a little too weak.

The people from the main peaks had all arrived at this Mystic Realm. At this time, there was a sudden commotion in the crowd.

Looking up, he saw more than ten young girls walking out from the entrance.

These young girls were all as delicate as water, but their strength could not be underestimated.

“Eh? Why are there only women on this main peak?” Qin Yu said in surprise.

The peak master explained, “This is Flower Peak. It’s also a rather unique main peak in Thunder Courtyard. The entire Flower Peak is filled with women. The one walking at the front is the peak master of Flower Peak.

Qin Yu looked over and found that the peak master of Flower Peak was an old woman.

She was hunched over and had a head of white hair, like an old woman from the countryside. Compared to the other girls on Flower Peak, she seemed out of place.

“Don’t look down on these women. Flower Granny is extremely powerful. In the entire Thunder Courtyard, she can be ranked in the top three.” The peak master said from the side.

Qin Yu nodded slightly. He could sense that although Flower Granny looked extremely plain, there was a flash of light in her every move. With every step she took, one could even see the Great Dao surging.

This person’s strength was most likely already powerful to an outrageous extent.

Just then, Qin Yu suddenly saw a familiar figure among the flowers.

“Eh? Wan’er?” Qin Yu was stunned, and her eyes quickly locked on a young girl beside Flower Granny!

This person was none other than Zhao Wan’er, who had gone to search for the Life Aura with Qin Yu!

Qin Yu did not think much of it. He quickly moved forward and stood in front of Zhao Wan’er.

“Wan’er?” Qin Yu tried to call out.

Zhao Wan’er was stunned to see Qin Yu. She opened her mouth to speak, but she could not help but look at Flower Granny.

Only then did Qin Yu realize that he had been rude. He quickly bowed and said, “Greetings, Flower Granny.”

Flower Granny’s deep eyes were fixed on Qin Yu.

Qin Yu seemed to have noticed something unusual in her old eyes. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The way Flower Granny looked at Qin Yu was too strange, as if she was looking at an old friend.

There seemed to be a trace of sadness and sorrow in the depths of her eyes, and she did not speak for a long time.

...

“Flower Granny?” Qin Yu thought that he had angered her, so he bowed again.

Flower Granny came back to her senses. She looked at Qin Yu and slowly said, “Chaotic body… Who are you?”

“I’m Qin Yu from the Demon-slaying Peak,” Qin Yu quickly said.

“Demon-slaying Peak…” Flower Granny’s mouth was slightly agape, as if she was recalling something.

“Reincarnation might really exist in this world…” Flower Granny muttered softly.

Qin Yu frowned and mumbled in his heart, “Is there something wrong with this old lady’s brain…”

“There’s nothing wrong with my brain. It’s just that seeing you reminds me of an old friend.” Flower Granny said, shaking her head.

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

“Damn it, Flower Granny can read my mind!”

Qin Yu did not dare to let his imagination run wild. He scratched his head awkwardly.

Flower Granny waved her hand. She looked at Zhao Wan’er and said, “Since you are old friends, go catch up.”

...

“Thank you, Flower Granny.” Zhao Wan’er was overjoyed. She looked at Qin Yu excitedly.

The two of them walked together and came to a place with no one.

“Qin Yu, when did you come to Thunder Courtyard? You’re still at Demon-slaying Peak?” Zhao Wan’er said impatiently.
