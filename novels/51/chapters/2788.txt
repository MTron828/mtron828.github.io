Chapter 2789: Investiture of the Demon

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Aiden’s body was not that strong, so he could not hold on any longer.

“Thank you so much!”

He reluctantly cupped his fists at Fatty Situ.

“No worries. Boss Qin Yu’s friend is my friend.” Fatty Situ chuckled.

Aiden’s expression froze as he glanced at Qin Yu.

With his information sources, he knew how terrifying the source of this seemingly laughable Little Fatty in front of him was.

However, his attitude towards Qin Yu made Aiden a little shocking.

This wasn’t a fake courtesy.

However, the Heavenly Umbrella shook slightly before he could think further.

Countless blood mists exploded just like that. The entire sky of the Nine Nether Cliff seemed to be evenly dyed in a layer of red.

Countless people’s bodies exploded into the tiniest dust. A terrifying pressure filled every space.

Rocks, trees, sand, grass, and countless other things that could be seen with the naked eye were directly crushed into powder by the huge pressure in the space quietly.

Nearly seventy percent of the Creepy suddenly split apart. At this moment, the Creepy standing at the front also began to tremble.

Countless tentacles appeared in the air, frantically snatching the blood of their kind.

Their bodies seemed to be different after devouring the blood.

“It seems that even these Creepy can’t withstand the pressure. I just saw Smoker Xie snatching the flesh of his kind. But be careful of that red bride. She hasn’t moved at all. This power should be easy for her.”

Qin Yu frowned and reminded the two people behind him.

“These Creepy seemed to have changed, but I can’t tell. It’s very strange!”

Aiden stared at Qin Ji. His sharp divine sense sensed a change, but he didn’t Imow how to describe it.

“The will of these things are indestructible. I also noticed that the Creepy that Qin Ji absorbed just now was also powerful. Although she was still the leader after the fusion, she gained that strange consciousness. This includes many subtle movements during battle.”

Qin Yu said with a frown. He had fought with the Creepy before.

Therefore, he was very familiar with some of the movements. If that was the case, he could almost confirm that these Creepy were indestructible.

Their consciousness would not be extinguished even if they were to explode under this immense pressure.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s powerful divine sense could tell these details.

“No way, Boss. You can even observe it!”

Fatty Situ was dumbfounded when he heard Qin Yu’s words.

“Are you sure?”

A man in black behind Fatty Situ suddenly asked in a deep voice.

“100%.”

Qin Yu did not hesitate. They had already guessed this question before.

His thoughts were verified now. The soul cloning in the Heavenly Sin had made his divine sense extremely powerful.

These details could not escape his observation.

“It’s the Investiture of the Demon! I didn’t expect it to appear here!”

The man in black inhaled sharply.

“Is it really that thing? Young Lord, this item can only be found by luck. You should leave first. It would be best if you are lucky enough to get it, but your safety is more important!”

“It’s fine. Let’s observe again. I still have a few life-saving items on me. When I see something wrong, I’ll immediately run away.”

Fatty Situ was instantly energized.

“No. Not even your Heavenly Umbrella can withstand this! If you don’t want to leave, we can only forcefully take you away. Although this is a supreme treasure, we have to be alive to enjoy it.”

The last person slowly stood up and knelt on one knee.

His voice was firm.

“Please don’t! This is also the first time I’ve seen such a grand occasion. How about I push myself to ten thousand meters away? I’ll immediately escape if something goes wrong. Look, I still have this thing on me. I wouldn’t say this without confidence.”

Fatty Situ was shocked.

Although the three persons were his subordinates, the Situ family had given them an order to protect him. This was the first factor in everything.

If he could not obtain their consent, he would probably be knocked unconscious and taken away from there. A talisman appeared in Fatty’s arms.

There was a picture on it.

Although it was a small talisman, one could sense the ups and downs of the mountains and rivers when one’s divine sense entered it. One could even sense the slow air.

The River Chart and the Inscription of the Luo!

They were two mysterious pictures passed down from ancient times. They contained the mysteries of the world’s Great Dao, such as the changes of heaven and earth, Yin and Yang, and the five elements.

These two pictures not only revealed the highest philosophy of the world of cultivation, but they had long disappeared.

Fuxi created the Eight Trigrams based on these pictures and started the Primordial Chaos era.

On the other hand, Da Yu relied on the power of the two items to successfully control the flood and save countless lives.

At this moment, this talisman seemed to have imprinted itself deeply into the River Chart and the Inscription of the Luo.

Even a Saint would find it difficult to draw such a talisman.

This was the most precious treasure of the Situ family.

This treasure could only be ranked in the top five in the family’s Dharma Treasure.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Seeing Fatty Situ take out this item, the three of them finally heaved a sigh of relief.

“Ten thousand meters away!”

With a wave of his hand, Fatty Situ, Qin Yu, Chang Mang, Aiden, and the others were sent to a space 10,000 meters away.

“What a terrifying power! He could teleport us over ten thousand meters with just a wave of his hand.”

Qin Yu sucked in a breath of cold air. This method seemed to be a little similar to Cang Yunzi’s Qian Kun in the sleeve.

However, each of them had their strengths. This person’s strength was not below Cang Yunzi’s.

“Fatty Situ, what’s the Investiture of the Demon you’re talking about? I’ve only heard of the Investiture of the God.”

Aiden was curious about the cautious people behind Fatty Situ.

“This thing is the Investiture of the God you mentioned. However, when it was successfully refined, its terrifying power made the Path of Heaven wary, so it sent down a boundless tribulation and tore off one-third of it. This one-third has been floating in the void. Under the control of the Path of Heaven, it has reached countless demonic lands. The Path of Heaven wanted to use this power to suppress it. This is the origin of this piece of paper.” “There is such a thing! I thought it was just a rumor.”

Aiden was dumbfounded.

“Rumor has it that the consciousness of the person who left his name on the Investiture of the Demon will be indestructible. Even the Path of Heaven cannot kill him. He will become an Immortal God in the future. How can the

Path of Heaven allow such a heaven-defying thing to exist? This includes the Creepy in front of us. I reckon that when this Investiture of the Demon appeared, they left a wisp of internal qi on the paper, so they have never indestructible and become the Creepy of the Nine Nether Cliff..”
