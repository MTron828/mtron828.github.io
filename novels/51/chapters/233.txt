Chapter 234: The Divine Sect Pill Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Dong Tianhai’s words left Qin Yu baffled.

For a moment, he even suspected that he had remembered wrongly.

Qin Yu hurriedly compared the list of herbs in his inherited memories. After confirming that there were no problems, he said, “Mr. Dong, what do you mean by this?”

Dong Tianhai wasn’t angry. He said with a nonchalant smile, “Qin Yu, to tell you the truth, I know better than you what herbs are needed for the Nine Transformation Golden Pill.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He waited for Dong Tianhai to continue.

Dong Tianhai said slowly, “The Nine Transformation Golden Pill is known as a warrior’s holy pill. The herbs needed are not hundred-year-old ginseng and Chinese knotweed, but two five-hundred-year-old herbs! And three hundred-year-old herbs!”

“So, if you can refine a Nine Transformation Golden Pill, I can give you my herb bank, let alone herbs,” Dong Tianhai said with a nonchalant smile.

This surprised Qin Yu somewhat.

Could it be that... the inheritance left behind by his father was wrong?

Impossible! This was absolutely impossible!

With his father’s abilities, refining a Nine Transformation Golden Pill wasn’t a problem.

In this way, there was only one possibility.

That was that the alchemy technique left behind by his father was even more brilliant!

Thinking of this, Qin Yu smiled and said, “Mr. Dong, as long as you provide me with the herbs on my list, I can give you a Nine Transformation Golden Pill.”

When he heard Qin Yu’s words, Dong Tianhai couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

His disciple’s face turned ashen. He took a step forward and berated, “Qin Yu, do you want to scam us? Let me tell you...”

“Shut up!” Dong Tianhai interrupted his disciple.

He looked at Qin Yu with a smile and said, “Qin Yu, I can’t provide you with these herbs. Since you agreed to use the Nine Transformation Golden Pill to exchange for my herbs, then naturally you need to think of a way to get the raw materials for this Nine Transformation Golden Pill yourself.”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment.

He raised his head to look at Dong Tianhai and said, “It’s not impossible. It’s just that the time needed may be extended. If you don’t mind, I naturally have no problem with it.”

“Of course I don’t mind.” Dong Tianhai suppressed his smile.

Qin Yu nodded and didn’t say anything else.

After saying goodbye to Dong Tianhai, Qin Yu left.

Dong Tianhai confirmed his guess.

“Qin Yu actually wants to swindle herbs from you?” His disciple snorted.

Dong Tianhai said with a nonchalant smile, “It’s normal. People like him who achieve success at a young age easily think that they are the smartest and treat others as fools.”

“Fortunately, you didn’t work with him,” his disciple said with a cold snort.

Dong Tianhai waved his hand and didn’t say anything else.

After Qin Yu returned, he prepared to look for herbs.

If what Dong Tianhai said was true, then this Nine Transformation Golden Pill could probably be exchanged for many top-grade herbs.

It seemed like he had to think of a way to get a batch of hundred-year-old herbs, Qin Yu thought to himself.

Although hundred-year-old herbs were rare, Qin Yu’s connections were much more powerful now.

With his current ability, it wasn’t difficult for him to obtain hundred-year-old herbs.

After thinking about it, Qin Yu finally decided to ask Jiang Gu for help.

Then, Qin Yu took out his phone and dialed Jiang Gu’s number.

As soon as the call was picked up, Jiang Gu smiled and said, “Mr. Qin, I was just about to call you. You are also here for the Divine Medicine, right?”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Divine Medicine? What Divine Medicine?”

Jiang Gu said with some surprise, “You still don’t know? It’s said that a Divine Medicine is about to be created in Bai City. Many big families in the Jiang Bei region have heard of it and have come here for a chance to obtain it.”

This surprised Qin Yu even more.

He didn’t know anything about the Divine Medicine at all.

Jiang Gu immediately told Qin Yu what had happened.

Only after Jiang Gu told Qin Yu did he find out about this matter.

“In that case, Dong Tianhai is most likely here for this Divine Medicine,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

A thousand-year-old Divine Medicine was hard to come by. Even Dong Tianhai, who was known as the Medicine King, had never seen it before.

“If I can obtain this Divine Medicine, I might be able to attempt to break through to the Monastic Stage.” Qin Yu felt a sense of excitement inside.

On the other end, Jiang Gu said, “Mr. Qin, the temptation of the Divine Medicine is too great. When the time comes, the families in the Jiang Bei region will definitely come and snatch it.”

“Jiang Bei region...” Qin Yu muttered this name.

The Jiang Bei region had a total of three provinces, and Chuzhou was a relatively weak area in terms of martial arts.

Other than Jiang Gu, there wasn’t even an Inner Strength Past Master. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

As for the other two provinces, there were several Inner Strength Past Masters overseeing them.

Obtaining the Divine Medicine wasn’t a simple task.

“Mr. Qin, I have a few old friends in the Jiang Bei region. Perhaps we can try to join forces with them,” Jiang Gu suggested.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment.

The effects of the thousand year Divine Medicine were unimaginable. It was unlikely that he could claim it alone.

Therefore, cooperation was essential.

“Okay, I’ll leave this matter to you,” said Qin Yu.

Jiang Gu agreed, “I’ll try to contact them as soon as possible.”

“Oh right, do me a favor.” At this point, Qin Yu suddenly changed the topic.

Jiang Gu hurriedly said, “Mr. Qin, please go ahead.”

Qin Yu said in a sullen voice, “I urgently need a hundred-year-old ginseng and a Chinese knotweed that is more than 150 years old. Help me think of a way. The price can be negotiated.”

When he heard this, Jiang Gu immediately felt a little troubled.

“Mr. Qin, these hundred-year-old herbs are not like cabbages by the roadside. Moreover... people who have these herbs are usually not short of money,” Jiang Gu said in a low voice.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment and said, “How about this? Spread the word that as long as you can provide me with hundred-year-old herbs, I’m willing to exchange the Divine Sect Pill with them.”

“Divine Sect Pill?” On the other end, Jiang Gu was immediately shocked.

“Mr. Qin, is what you said true?” Jiang Gu said with some excitement.

“Yes. As long as you can provide me with 100-year-old herbs, I can make as many Divine Sect Pills as people want,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

The Divine Sect Pill was a kind of pill in the martial arts world.

And the effect of this pill was simple yet astonishing

A martial artist at the Inner Strength Past Master realm only needed to consume one pill to be able to advance one level.

If one was talented, one pill could even help them advance several levels!

In other words, this Divine Sect Pill could help create a large group of experts at the peak of the Inner Strength Past Master realm!

“No problem, Mr. Qin, I’ll spread the word right away!” Jiang Gu hurriedly said.

After hanging up the phone, Qin Yu stroked his chin.

“If I want to cooperate with others, I still need to have sufficient strength,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

If he didn’t have the strength, even if he could cooperate with others, he definitely wouldn’t have the biggest say.

“There’s still half a month’s time. I have to think of a way as soon as possible,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Soon, Jiang Gu spread the news of the Divine Sect Pill.

As expected, the moment the news broke out, it immediately caused a commotion in the martial arts world!

Martial arts aristocratic families of various sizes, all wanting to obtain the Divine Medicine, came one after another!
