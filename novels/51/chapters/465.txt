Chapter 466: If You Can Do It, I Can! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The people who were preparing to leave were all shocked by this scene!

They stopped and looked back. The shock on their faces became more and more intense.

Boom!

A huge explosion sounded, and the black ball of light began to disintegrate!

Crash!

The four symbols demonic seal, which was said to be impossible to escape, actually shattered piece by piece!

And under this brilliance, there was Qin Yu’s immortal body!

Qin Yu, who was under the cosmic form, was like an undefeatable war god shining with the light of faith in the dark night!

Qin Yu panted heavily while looking at He Teng coldly.

“This spell really made me suffer a lot.” Qin Yu wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and said coldly.

If he didn’t have the power of the Divine Dragon, he would have died here today.

The gap between a peak Inner Strength Grandmaster and a half-step Martial Marquis was a bit exaggerated.

Even though Qin Yu had the power of the Divine Dragon, the Venerable Fifth Mountain, and the Divine Rank cultivation technique, he almost died from this four symbols demonic seal!

“How... how is this possible!?” He Teng’s expression instantly turned extremely ugly!

The four symbols demonic seal was his trump card. Now that the four symbols demonic seal had been broken, what other moves could stop Qin Yu?

“You are only an Inner Strength Grandmaster, so how can you have such strength?!” He Teng roared indignantly!

Qin Yu sneered. “I said, if I step into the half-step Martial Marquis realm, I can kill you within three seconds.”

These words entered everyone’s ears.

No one doubted the authenticity of these words.

Qin Yu, as an Inner Strength Grandmaster, had forced He Teng to this extent. This already explained everything.

“It’s my turn.” Qin Yu summoned the cosmic form and said coldly.

The huge figure, with an extremely strong sense of oppression, arrived in front of He Teng in the blink of an eye!

He Teng was naturally unwilling to give up. He waved his fist to fight to the death.

However, how powerful was Qin Yu’s physical body under the cosmic form? How could He Teng be compared to him?

At the moment of contact, He Teng’s bones shattered!

His body drew a parabola in the air and fell to the ground!

“Boom!”

Qin Yu waved his large palm, and a ray of light shot straight towards the lake!

In an instant, a huge explosion occurred in the lake, and the entire area was turned into ruins!

He Teng crawled out from the ruins with great difficulty. Blood flowed from his mouth, and his physical body was on the verge of shattering. Half of his body had already been blown to pieces!

Under such heavy injuries, He Teng no longer had the ability to resist!

“Qin Yu, you... I must kill you!” He Teng roared angrily! However, he was helpless.

The only response he received was an incomparably fierce punch!

“Boom!”

The bones in He Teng’s entire body were almost shattered. His entire body was covered in blood, and it was almost impossible to see his face clearly.

The crowd was completely silent. Everyone stared at this scene, as if they couldn’t believe it was real.

“An Inner Strength Grandmaster... defeated a half-step Martial Marquis?”

“This is the first time in history, right?”

“Even Jiang He and Ye Qing couldn’t do it back then.”

Jiang He himself lamented, “If I forcefully suppressed my realm to the peak of an Inner Strength Grandmaster, I wouldn’t be a match for Qin Yu.”

“If he stepped into the half-step Martial Marquis realm, how invincible would he be?”

“If he stepped into the Martial Marquis realm, there should be nothing in this world that can stop him.”

Such a high evaluation shocked his disciple.

Although Jiang He had praised Qin Yu many times, he had never said such an exaggerated thing.

“Qin Yu... you deserve to die...” In the distance, He Teng climbed out of the ruins with great difficulty.

He, the number one person on the potential rankings, had now fallen into such a state.

He Teng, who had stepped into the half-step Martial Marquis realm, had thought that he would be able to flaunt his strength and let his family become the number one family in the Central Plains.

However, he had never expected that he would be defeated the moment he made his move. In the end, he was defeated by an Inner Strength Grandmaster.

All his hopes had been crushed.

“Retreat. If this continues, you will die here...” that hoarse voice sounded in He Teng’s mind.

He Teng gritted his teeth. He glared at Qin Yu angrily and said unwillingly, “I won’t give up just like that. Qin Yu... I will kill you sooner or later!”

“I’m afraid you won’t have that chance!” Qin Yu’s internal qi and blood were burning. His golden body suddenly shook, and a terrifying internal qi instantly sent He Teng flying!

He Teng didn’t dare to continue to pester him. He muttered in a low voice, as if he was casting some kind of spell.

Then, a magic artifact that looked like a command flag appeared in his hand!

“Another spatial teleportation magic artifact.” Qin Yu’s expression turned cold. Last time, He Teng used this method to escape!

“I’m afraid he will escape today.” Jiang He also recognized the command flag in He Teng’s hand and couldn’t help but shake his head.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. His eyes were closed, and his body was as huge as an iron tower!

In a moment, the golden light on Qin Yu’s body actually condensed out of his palm!

The light on his body began to dim, and in Qin Yu’s hand, streaks of golden light suddenly appeared!

“Let me try your four symbols demonic seal as well.” Qin Yu held the golden light in his hands, and the corners of his mouth curled up into a cold smile.

Seeing this scene, everyone was stunned!

Qin Yu actually wanted to use He Teng’s cultivation technique to stop He Teng?

“He... He also knows the four symbols demonic seal?!” Jiang He’s disciple shouted in shock!

Jiang He, who was beside him, also watched in shock!

His old face was full of astonishment! He was even a little excited!

This young man, Qin Yu, had brought him too many surprises!

“No...” At this moment, Jiang He suddenly realized something! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

He said in surprise, “Qin Yu... He learned it on the spot!”

“Learned it on the spot? What do you mean?” His disciple didn’t understand what Jiang He meant.

Jiang He exclaimed, “He doesn’t know the four symbols demonic seal at all. He comprehended it on the spot through He Teng’s technique!”

To comprehend such a technique in such a short time, this...! Was this possible?!

“How do you know the four symbols demonic seal?!” When He Teng saw this scene, his face instantly turned pale!

Qin Yu sneered and said, “I don’t know it. I just learned it from you, but I don’t know whether it will succeed or not...”

After receiving Qin Yu’s confirmation, everyone was completely dumbfounded!
