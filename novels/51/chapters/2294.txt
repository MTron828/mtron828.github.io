2295 Defeat Gu Ming

The bracelet on Gu Ming’s hand snapped, and the remaining three beads suddenly enlarged into giant heads.

Qin Yu put on his Gale Resistance Boot, and with a flash, his figure was already a thousand meters away. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The explosive power of this skull bead was incredibly astonishing. It was best to shake it off using speed so he would not waste his chaotic power to defend.

Gu Ming was not his only enemy now.

“Where are you escaping!”

The skulls suddenly expanded hundreds and thousands of times, and a surging energy of dead bodies smashed toward Qin Yu like a meteor.

The three skulls surrounded all of Qin Yu’s paths. As they approached Qin Yu, the skulls emitted a bright green light.

A large area of space was enveloped in dense light, making people feel incomparably stifled.

“Explode!”

Gu Ming’s face revealed a ferocious expression.

In an instant, a massive green light flashed across the entire space.

The wildfire caused by the explosion of the energy of dead bodies sucked all the air away in an instant.

A few weaker ones were burned into ashes by the flames of the energy of dead bodies’ explosion.

The sealed space caused an even more intense explosion. The terrifying corpse fire instantly enveloped Qin Yu.

The Suo Lin’s shield!

The boxing gloves in Qin Yu’s hands suddenly turned into a massive shield. The ghost fire burned fiercely but could not break through the enormous shield.

“Is this Suo Lin’s divine artifact? It’s so powerful! It was a divine artifact that could transform.”

“Both offense and defense in one. How great would it be if I had this!”

…

Even a veteran cultivator like Situ Haoyue looked at Suo Lin’s divine artifact with a burning gaze.

However, to defend against this terrifying attack, he had used up half of his chaotic power.

Gu Ming’s face exhibited a resentful expression.

He leaped high into the air, and his entire body emitted circles of green ripples.

As his feet slammed into the ground, the green power of rules suddenly trembled violently.

The Dark Abyss Domain!

In an instant, Qin Yu sensed a strange power underneath the space. As Gu Ming stomped his feet, the power was suddenly absorbed.

“Go to hell!”

Gu Ming threw himself at Qin Yu in a strange posture. The power fiercely surged from the ground.

His arm suddenly expanded, and the green power of rules wrapped around his arm.

With a terrifying aura, it smashed toward Qin Yu’s head.

“I’d like to see how you resist the power of rules.”

Situ Haoyue narrowed his eyes.

Qin Yu also threw a punch. The Fire Fist that was burning with the power of annihilation attacked suddenly.

The dark abyss and annihilation.

The two rules intertwined and annihilated.

They were reborn again in their true bodies.

The terrifying explosions filled the entire space. The green energy of dead bodies and burning black flames filled the entire space.

“Roar!”

The power of rules surging on the ground surged into Gu Ming’s body almost instantly.

His arm instantly turned dark green and emitted a gloomy green light.

“Crack! Crack!”

As the power of annihilation clashed with the dark abyss qi, the power of annihilation began to collapse.

The black power of annihilation shattered like glass. After that, with an earth-shattering force, Gu Ming’s palm, infused with his full force of rules slammed Qin Yu’s chest.

At the last moment, Suo Lin’s shield blocked his chest.

Qin Yu was pushed back thousands of feet away by this terrifying attack, and Suo Lin’s shield left a deep ditch on the ground.

“As expected, the power of annihilation is still not sufficient to deal with these ninth-grade veteran cultivators.”

Qin Yu sighed. The Annihilation Rules belonged to the rules of the previous Path of Heaven and were suppressed, to begin with.

“He’s not even injured?”

Gu Ming’s expression was tremendously ugly. Qin Yu’s terrifying body coupled with Suo Lin’s divine artifact was almost invincible. He could not possibly defeat Qin Yu by himself.

“Why aren’t you guys attacking? Are you waiting for him to kill me?”

Gu Ming shouted.

“No one can save you today.”

Qin Yu’s voice was like the voice of a Nine Netherworld Demon God. He stomped his feet.

Nine fire dragons suddenly surged and lifted Qin Yu into the void.

The cosmic form!

Qin Yu’s body suddenly expanded a thousand times, and a terrifying pressure locked onto Gu Ming. His expression changed drastically.

It was my turn!

Qin Yu stepped forward and covered a distance of a thousand feet. He unleashed the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch and formed a hand seal, and then arrived above Gu Ming in an instant.

A giant fist pressed down like a mountain. Nine fire dragons that were so hot that they could burn the air spiraled around the massive arm and followed closely behind.

“Stop!”

Situ Haoyue shouted coldly and stood up abruptly.

Qin Yu’s expression was indifferent. He completely ignored Situ Haoyue’s words, and his arm sped up again.

Nine fire dragons circled behind the massive fist. Gu Ming felt as if the air was being sucked dry.

The terrifying force even made him lose the ability to resist. In a hurry, he took out a bronze cauldron to block before him.

“Ding!”

The bronze cauldron did not even last a breath before it shattered.

The mountain-like massive fist landed on Gu Ming’s body with a sea of fire directly. Countless rocks exploded, and the ground shook violently like a violent earthquake.

Gu Ming was even more miserable. He only had a third of his body left. His broken body was in a deep hole, looking incredibly miserable.

At the same time, Situ’s finger slid down, and the terrifying power of Path of Heaven pierced through it.

It struck Qin Yu’s body and cut off half of the shoulder of his cosmic form.

The enormous cosmic form suddenly disappeared. Qin Yu’s face was a little pale. This attack happened the moment he attacked. He could only rely on his body to take it head-on. This time, he was injured.

As the cosmic form was connected to his body, Qin Yu’s body also suffered a tremendous shock.

“Hiss!”

The entire eighth level was dead silent.

Gu Ming was defeated! How could it be?

These cultivators did not make a move because they wanted to preserve their strength and wait for Qin Yu to die to see if they could get a share of the loot.

However, they did not expect Qin Yu to almost kill Gu Ming. He would not have been injured if it were not for Situ Haoyue’s sneak attack.

“Am I dreaming? A fourth-grade True Saint defeated the sect master of the Blood Sect?”

“Moreover, he seems to have comprehended the power of Path of Heaven. How can a fourth grade comprehend the power of the Path of Heaven? I can’t understand.”

“I can still accept it if the fifth grade has defeated Gu Ming. However, his strength is only at the fourth grade True Saint. What’s going on?”

The group discussed animatedly because some cultivators had never come into contact with Qin Yu.

Therefore, his performance now seemed to be a fantasy to them.

“You guys don’t understand this, do you? Strength encompasses the comprehensive overlay of the body, cultivation method, divine sense, and treasures.”
