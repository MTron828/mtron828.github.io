2508 Earthly Fiend Techniques

Almost all were scared out of their wits. They seemed to disbelieve the Fallen Godly King could unleash such a terrifying attack.

“Qin Yu!”

The Sumeru ring floated in the air and flew toward Elder Guai.

The Sumeru ring had three persons’ soul imprints. One was Qin Yu’s, one was Yan Ruoxue’s, and the other was the previous master of the Sumeru ring, Elder Guai.

Now that it had lost two persons’ internal qi, the Sumeru ring turned into a stream of light and entered Elder Guai’s hand.

Tears welled up in Elder Guai’s and others’ eyes. They did not believe that Qin Yu could survive this attack.

Regardless Elder Gual, Chang Mang, Jue Wu, Lei Xin, and others were all in a deadly fight. They did not even have time to grieve.

However, the moment Elder Guai received the Sumeru ring, he was stunned.

Inside the Sumeru ring, a glazed holy bone was slowly drifting.

He sensed it slightly and seemed to be able to feel Qin Yu’s internal qi within.

“Elder Guai, don’t show any abnormality and let others notice.”

Yan Ruoxue hand gestured at Elder Guai to keep quiet and would not disclose any clues.

It was merely a glazed holy bone, but Yan Ruoxue could feel the surging life force within.

Qin Yu miraculously survived this attack!

She did not know what method it was, but Qin Yu had worked this miracle.

Tears welled up in her eyes as she looked at the holy bone. At this moment, the holy bone emanated the blue ocean power.

The terrifying power of the water element slowly nourished the holy bone into a newborn bone.

As Yan Ruoxue was afraid that it would attract the attention of outside the Sumeru World, with a thought, she sent out a thick energy barrier to cover that fragment of holy bone.

She triggered the Breath Seeking Formation that Wang Feng had set up previously. Otherwise, it would be a situation where they would fight to the death again if He Teng discovered it.

“Are you satisfied now? The little b*stard is dead. Hand over your soul to me obediently, and I will bring you to a new cultivation realm.”

He Teng let out a strange laugh. He tore through space and jumped into it, totally unafraid of the terrifying spatial turbulence.

Ksitigarbha, between the illusions, stared at the two and revealed a strange smile.

On another battlefield, the fight went on for a long time.

After a long time, nearly 3,000 of the ghost race tore through space and arrived at the Holy Region again.

With the appearance of this ghost race, terrifying ghost qi instantly wreaked havoc in the air, and the human race continent was shrouded in eerie gusts of wind.

Countless dead souls let out shrill roars as if they wanted to break through the order of the Path of Heaven and charge toward the ghost race.

“Xiao Hai! You’re finally here! I’ve been waiting for you for a long time!”

Xiao Sheng’s eyes lit up, and he laughed maniacally.

A living being with a gentle and warm countenance stood amidst the ghost race leaders.

“In this battle, we are allies. We cannot fight against each other.”

He looked at Xiao Sheng, who looked exactly like him and did not seem surprised.

He smiled faintly and a gentle force sent Xiao Sheng back to Immortal Crane.

“Your elder brother is quite interesting.”

Immortal Crane sat on the throne and unknowingly revealed a strange expression.

“Brother Xiao Hai, how did you become a battle commander of the ghost race?”

“Xiao Hai, you once spent your time in Nanzhou for the sake of the human race living beings in Nazhou!”

“D*mn it, you’ve become the ghost race’s lackey! I’ve always treated you as the most respectable person!”

…

Xiao Hai’s appearance caused a commotion among the human race, especially in Nazhou, where everyone knew this legend.

He forcefully crossed the Dead Sea with his physical body and used his own strength to forcibly stop the North Plain from conquering Nanzhou.

However, this time, Xiao Hai had become a battle commander of the ghost race.

Xiao Hai was still smiling as he untied the cloak tied to his shoulders.

“That was the Xiao Hai in the past. The current him is the unfettered messenger of hell.”

He threw the cloak into the air, and in an instant, the cloak silently expanded like a giant flower that bloomed vigorously, enveloping the surrounding space.

That cloak was actually Xiao Hai’s other world!

Underworld Insight.

The power of order suddenly poured down, and the shocking sound of chains clashing could be heard in the air.

These chains pierced deep into the space, and a strange internal qi permeated the continent.

The human race living beings’ faces revealed incomparable fearful expressions. They realized a hell had appeared before them.

Underworld Insight meant encountering spirits, delving deeply into the divine, and gaining insight into the depths of the underworld.

It was using the power of divine ability to summon hell before the human race.

In an instant, nearly a few thousand human race living beings were so frightened by the hell that suddenly appeared in the divine sense, and they struggled and panted on the ground.

It was the real underworld, and even if those who battled here were the elites of the human race, they could not resist this ultimate fear of the underworld. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Forbidden Water.

As he uttered the two-word incantation again, numerous tides surged within the area shrouded by his cloak.

This Forbidden Water referred to a river that was impassable or poisonous. It was a place in hell where people were forbidden from walking, and it was often set up in forbidden areas.

As soon as the Forbidden Water fell, countless humans died miserably again.

“72 Earthly Fiend Techniques. It’s the ultimate forbidden technique in the netherworld. This ghost race living being has learned it!”

Su Xinghe’s face revealed a furious expression.

“Thunder Eight Trigrams!”

“Four Seasons Sword Technique!”

Almost simultaneously, Lei Huan and Yan Guyun charged forward. Xiao Hai’s techniques similarly had an extensive range.

Moreover, he seemed to have the strength to continue attacking after using two of these large-scale techniques.

If they did not stop it, the human race would probably suffer tremendously heavy losses.

Nightmare Prayer.

Xiao Hai turned his back to the two and again uttered a two-word incantation.

“What a terrifying technique of illusions! The Nightmare Prayer uses illusions to confuse people. It is also called the illusion technique in short. Those who are hit by it will be in a nightmare.”

Lei Huan and Yan Guyun suddenly froze on the spot. In an instant, their souls underwent a subtle change.

The familiar environment suddenly became distorted, and the colors changed unpredictably. They seemed to have entered a dream that surpassed reality.

At this moment, the outline of the world became blurry, and the two dared to move.

“Crack!”

The strange vision before Yan Guyun suddenly vanished, and the world before his eyes tilted abruptly.

Xiao Hai stretched out his hand and crushed his neck. At the last moment, the power of thunder exploded, and Lei Huan escaped from the world of illusion.

“Whoosh!”

Lei Huan, burning his spiritual energy, actually fled without looking back. His face was ashen, and he could not help but turn around to look at Xiao Hai.

He had never thought they would be like little chicks in front of Xiao Hai, having no resistance at all.

Yan Tianshi and the other members of the Yan family screamed in pain.

Yan Guyun, who had fought alongside him for so many years, had died at the hands of Xiao Hai.

This made him incomparably furious, but at the same time, he felt a deep sense of powerlessness.
