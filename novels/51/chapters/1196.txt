Chapter 1197: Chapter 1,197 was another ancient array platform 

The woman didn’t waste any more time. She immediately led Qin Yu to her “Best friend”.

It was a woman around 60 years old. She looked quite old.

“Old Meng, this young man is looking for the Jade Bodhisattva,”the woman said as she walked.

Upon hearing the words ‘Jade Bodhisattva’, a hint of surprise flashed in the eyes of the woman called Old Meng.

She sized up Qin Yu and said in surprise, “You... you look like the Jade Bodhisattva. You’re practically the same mold!”

Qin Yu had seen his mother’s portrait and indeed looked a little similar to himself.

“She’s my mother.”Qin Yu did not hide it.

The surprise on old Meng’s face suddenly intensified.

She reached out and touched Qin Yu’s face, saying, “Back then, the Jade Bodhisattva gave birth to a baby boy. We all thought that he was already dead. I didn’t expect that... you’ve already grown so big.”

Qin Yu hurriedly said, “Aunt, do you know where my mother went?”

Old Meng took out his tobacco pipe.

She sighed and said, “It’s a long story.”

“Back then, your mother was a famous village flower in the village. She was beautiful and kind-hearted, so she was named the Jade Buddha.”

“Later, a young man from another village came to our village. He was extremely handsome and tall. Soon, he fell in love with your mother. Now that I think about it, that young man should be your father.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and waited for her to continue.

“But for some reason, one day, your father suddenly left without saying goodbye. For a time, rumors spread in the village

“In the village, the scariest thing was the rumors. During that period of time, your mother cried all day, and her back was almost broken.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s expression became even more unsightly.

For a moment, he even hated his father. Leaving his wife and children just like that, he simply had no sense of responsibility at all.

“From then on, your mother became mysterious. Some people said that she was possessed, while others said that she became seriously ill because she was too sad,”old Meng continued.

“Until one day, it was a night of thunder and lightning. Suddenly, a few people in black robes came to our village.”

Qin Yu’s expression changed. He hurriedly looked at Old Meng, waiting for her to continue.

“At that time, I slept with your mother every day to comfort her, but... but because I was too afraid, I didn’t dare to say anything on the day your mother was taken away. I just followed behind secretly...”Old Meng sighed, he seemed to blame himself.

Qin Yu hurriedly said, “Aunt, it’s not your fault. You just need to tell me where those people took her!”

Old Meng opened his mouth and sighed. “You might not believe me if I tell you. I saw those people suddenly disappear with your mother with my own eyes.”

“Disappeared?”Qin Yu frowned.

Old Meng grunted and said, “I had a reaction with the village, but the village didn’t believe it. They thought I was talking nonsense, and then the matter slowly sank.”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment and said, “Aunt, where did they disappear? Do you remember?”

“I remember that place all the time. It’s behind the village,”said Old Meng.

Qin Yu quickly bowed and said, “Please take me to take a look.”

Old Meng didn’t say much. She slowly got up and brought Qin Yu out of the house.

The two of them passed through the village and came to the back of the village.

It was a barren land, and the ground was full of weeds.

Old Meng brought Qin Yu to a pile of weeds and stopped.

She pointed at the weeds in front of her and said, “It’s been a long time. I only remember this location.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He quickly walked over and pushed away the weeds with his bare hands.

Under the weeds, there was an ancient formation stage!

“How is this possible!”Qin Yu’s expression changed immediately!

Ancient Formation Stage? In other words, they had used the ancient array platform to leave this place?

Could it be that... his mother had been brought to the saint-level?

Qin Yu used his hand to touch the array platform, only to see that it was engraved with complicated characters.

These characters were extremely strange, and Qin Yu couldn’t understand a single one of them.

The flags that had been placed around it had long since been tattered and almost weathered away.

“Aunt, are you sure that my mother disappeared from this location?”Qin Yu turned to look at Old Meng. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Old Meng nodded and said, “I remember it clearly. This is the place.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath. He suddenly understood why Tian Jizi could not find his mother’s location.

There was only one reason, and that was that his mother was not on this planet at all.

“That’s not right.”Qin Yu rubbed his chin.

Since she was no longer on this planet, then what was the meaning of the dream that day? Intentionally preventing Qin Yu from heading to the saint-level? And who was the person who had delivered the Inkstone?

Qin Yu couldn’t figure it out.

All the clues seemed to have been cut off at this moment.

Qin Yu sat on the platform, pondering for a long time. The more he thought about it, the stranger he felt.

This world didn’t seem to be as simple as he had imagined.

He had thought that he was already the number one person in the world, but someone had been able to silently send Qin Yu the Inkstone and put it by his pillow.

This was enough to prove that the person who did this was far more powerful than Qin Yu.

“That’s not right. The picture in the inkstone clearly shows mother being locked in a dungeon...”Qin Yu muttered softly.

He looked at Old Meng and said in a deep voice, “Could it be that old Meng is lying? Or perhaps... This isn’t the ancient array platform that leads to the Holy Region?”

“F * ck.”Qin Yu felt as if his head was about to explode. Countless questions lingered in Qin Yu’s mind.

“Maybe I saw wrong.”Old Meng waved his hand.

Qin Yu hurriedly shook his head and said, “No, what you saw is real.”

Old Meng sighed. Just as she was about to speak, Qin Yu suddenly saw a faint light rising from the distance.

“Eh?”Qin Yu frowned slightly. He slowly stood up and looked at the light pillar in the distance.

“This is... the spell of the Sky Blood Rainbow!”Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed!

The Sky Blood Rainbow actually reactivated the spell of the immortal slaying sect!

“Aunt, thank you for your help. I still have some matters to settle, so I’ll take my leave first,”Qin Yu said hurriedly.

He left a sum of money for old Meng and rushed back in a hurry.

After Qin Yu left, old Meng’s expression quickly darkened.

She no longer had the slightest bit of decadence from before. Instead, it was replaced by an indescribable coldness.

Old Meng took out his cell phone and dialed a number.

“The son of the Jade Bodhisattva is here,”old Meng said coldly.

“Oh? His son can actually find this place?”A surprised voice came from the other end.

“Yes, but don’t worry. I’ve checked. There’s no spiritual energy fluctuation in this child’s body,”Old Meng said indifferently.

“That’s good. Since he’s the son of the Jade Bodhisattva, he must be a chaotic body too. Bring him here when you have the chance,”the other end said.

“Got it.”Old Meng hung up the phone.
