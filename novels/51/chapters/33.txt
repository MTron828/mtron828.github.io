Chapter 34: The Cocktail Party of the Rich Kids Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Staring at the clamorous crowd, Qin Yu furrowed his brows.

He was not fond of such an environment, so he searched for a desolate place and sat down.

Qin Yu then closed his eyes and began his breathing exercises.

The concentration of spiritual energy around this area was relatively high so Qin Yu would never miss the opportunity to take in as much Qi as possible.

At that time, Zhao Gang and Su Yan, who were invited to the cocktail party, arrived at the venue.

”Honey, I heard that the person hosting this cocktail party is some big shot. Shen Tian from Chuzhou, I think? Is he someone outstanding?” Su Yan whispered.

Zhao Gang snorted, “Would you listen to yourself? The Shen family is considered the elite among the elites in Chuzhou. They are leagues apart from us.”

Upon hearing that, Su Yan started contemplating.

”How do they compare with the Yan family?” Su Yan asked.

Zhao Gang frowned a little and heaved a sigh.

”The Yan family is from Jingdu. So, do you still think they are on the same level?” Zhao Gang shot her a look.

Zhao Gang then abruptly changed the topic by remarking, “Speaking of which, I heard rumors about Shen Tian’s infatuation with Yan Ruoxue. Hence, I presumed that he came here this time for Qin Yu.”

Su Yan was excited and questioned, “So, are you suggesting that Qin Yu is in a tight spot now?”

”Well, I guess you are right,” Zhao Gang replied.

”That’s awesome!” Su Yan exclaimed, jumping for joy.

”It rubs me the wrong way whenever I recount the fact that Qin Yu thought he had his own way,” Su Yan shrilled.

Even though Zhao Gang did not say a word, he seconded Su Yan’s remark.

Zhao Gang was displeased that a person who used to be unable to tie his shoelaces had now risen through the ranks to surpass him.

The crowd at the party was mostly made up of rich kids and gold-diggers who buttered up the former in an attempt to become their mistresses.

At the front row of the party, a white-haired young man whispered, “Mr. Shen, Qin Yu has arrived.”

Narrowing his eyes, Shen Tian chided, “Why is he here?”

After some contemplation, a cunning smirk ran across Shen Tian’s face.

”Since he had the guts to come uninvited, he should be prepared for the humiliation. Fret not, for we have an impromptu program,” Shen Tian stated with his eyes squinted.

”Do you want me to deal with him?” the white-haired young man asked tentatively.

Shen Tian shook his head and replied, “No, we’re not in a hurry. I want to humiliate him as much as I can first. Then, I’ll wipe the floor with him and let him know his place!”

The white-haired young man nodded before questioning in worry, “If we lay a finger on Qin Yu, wouldn’t Yan Ruoxue be furious? If that’s the case, things will get ugly.”

Shen Tian chortled, “Don’t sweat it. Yan Ruoxue is known to be an ice queen. We might have gotten the impression that Qin Yu has won her heart, but she would never concern herself with anyone.”

”That’s great to hear.” The white-haired young man heaved a sigh of relief.

What Shen Tian said was the truth. Yan Ruoxue was the center of the spotlight in Jingdu. The countless attempts of her admirers came up futile with her ruthless rejections. Some of them lamented that she had a heart made of stone.

However, Shen Tian totally underestimated the importance of Qin Yu to Yan Ruoxue.

...

Qin Yu sat in a corner, absorbing the spiritual energy around him as much as possible.

He had never encountered any place with such a high concentration of Qi.

”Mr. Qin?” a voice could be heard calling out.

Frowning, Qin Yu slowly opened his eyes and was met with the gaze of a young man, standing before him with a gentle smile.

That person was none other than the son of Jiangcheng’s richest, Du Yuan.

”Fancy seeing you here.” Qin Yu stared at Du Yuan in confusion.

Du Yuan queried with a courteous smile, “Do you mind if I sit here?”

”Suit yourself.” Qin Yu nodded and closed his eyes again. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

”Mr. Qin, please pardon me for overstepping, but could you please hear me out?” Du Yuan said.

Qin Yu heaved a long, silent sigh.

He had planned to focus on his cultivation initially, but it seems the current circumstance would not allow him to do so.

Thus, he resignedly gave up on it for the time being.

”You may speak your mind. You don’t have to be modest,” Qin Yu assured.

Du Yuan scanned his surroundings before murmuring to Qin Yu, “Mr. Qin, you have to leave now.”

”Leave?” Qin Yu lifted his brows, peering at Du Yuan in perplexity.

Du Yuan sighed, “I heard from a friend that Shen Tian feels animosity towards you.”

Qin Yu had anticipated that long ago, hence he was not in the slightest bit surprised. He nodded with a polite smile in response.

Upon seeing that, Du Yuan reminded, “Mr. Qin, you must not underestimate Shen Tian. His family is from Chuzhou.

”Also, I’ve heard that he even brought a skilled fighter with him today. So, please heed my advice and leave at once.”

After scrutinizing Du Yuan, Qin Yu asked in suspicion, “Mr. Du, I don’t remember being that close with you. So why are you telling me all these? Aren’t you afraid to be overheard by Shen Tian?”

Du Yuan smiled wryly and declared, “To be honest, I may be afraid of crossing Shen Tian, but I have despised him since day one!”

Exasperation was written all over Du Yuan’s face as he spoke.

He went on, “Years ago, my father went on a business trip to the capital, and he came across the Shen family there.

”Do you know what Shen Tian said? He called us savages, jeering at us that country bumpkins like us should return to Jiangcheng!”

Du Yuan was burning with anger at the mention of this matter.

”Who is he to be so full of himself? Who does he think he is?” Du Yuan chastised.

At that, Qin Yu let out a chuckle.

It seemed like Shen Tian was a natural-born narcissist with a severe superiority complex.

”Mr. Qin, please don’t mind my prattle, but it’d be best for you to leave now. Otherwise, Shen Tian will not let you off the hook so easily,” Du Yuan exhorted.

Qin Yu answered with a smile, “Thanks for your advice. But I’m not scared of him.”
