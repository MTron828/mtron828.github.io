Chapter 1351: Chapter 1,351, Myriad sect gathering 1 

Qin Yu laughed awkwardly, not knowing how to reply.

With the two of them as backers, the heavenly cloud sect would most likely not do anything.

But once there was a conflict, it would most likely be a great war.

The next day.

Wen Wanyun and the others had already dressed up early in order to participate in this banquet.

“What is the purpose of this myriad sect gathering?”Qin Yu asked with some doubt.

Wen Wanli said, “To put it bluntly, it’s to divide the territory, but in reality, it’s just a formality. Everyone knows that the Heavenly Cloud sect is currently in the number one position.”

Qin Yu spread out his hands. This was the truth.

“I wonder if Guan Zhuangti’s other people will come,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Not long after, Wen Da and Wen Er also walked out. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

These two people had obviously dressed up meticulously and looked extremely handsome.

“Grandpa, let’s work hard today and find a grandson-in-law for you!”Wen Da said excitedly.

Wen Wan rolled his eyes and said, “Keep bragging. Who Would Like You?”

“Grandpa, you’re underestimating my charm too much,”Wen da said unhappily.

“That’s right, that’s right. It’s fine if you don’t like his charm, but do you not even care about my handsomeness?”Wen Er followed up.

“Go to hell!”Wen Da kicked Wen Er’s butt.

“Alright, don’t waste time. The myriad sect meeting is about to begin. Let’s go,”Wen Wanli said.

Jue Wu, who was at the side, hurriedly jumped onto Qin Yu’s shoulder.

She had a lollipop in her mouth. She sat on Qin Yu’s shoulder and swayed her calves, feeling quite at ease.

“Let’s Go!”Jue Wu shouted.

The group of people didn’t waste any more time and rushed toward the great Yue mountain.

The Great Yue Mountain was an extremely mysterious place.

In the center of the mountain, there was a huge statue.

The statue was lifelike and looked extremely domineering.

The owner of the statue was the famous da Yue, one of the great cultivators who had transcended the tribulation.

At this moment, many people had already come to the Da Yue Mountain.

Those who could attend the myriad sect gathering were naturally extraordinary. They were basically the city lords of large city-states or the sect lords of first-rate sects.

In the depths of the Da Yue Mountain, there was a place that was like a Fairyland on Earth.

There was Jade Dew, immortal mountains, and pavilions. Delicious food could be seen everywhere. They were all demonic beasts from the Green Rock Forest, and the fine wine had been treasured for countless years.

The tables placed everywhere seemed to be made of jade, and the wine cups and lacquer plates were extremely exquisite.

There were elegant young masters drinking and chatting with Qingcheng, and there were also sect leaders reminiscing about the past.

When Qin Yu, Wen Wanyun, and the others arrived, the place was already crowded with guests.

When they saw Wen wanyun, many of them stood up and greeted him.

When they saw the unique dance sitting on Qin Yu’s shoulder, their expressions changed slightly and they subconsciously moved to the side.

There were also people secretly sizing up the unique dance on their shoulders, but they didn’t dare to say a word.

“What are you looking at! If you keep looking, I’ll knock your eyeballs out!”

“That kid, what are you laughing at? Do you believe that I’ll Tear Your Mouth Open for you?”

Jue Wu’s curses caused the people around them to immediately disperse.

“Why are you so irritable?”Qin Yu asked softly.

Jue Wu said impatiently, “How would I know? I just don’t like them.”

Qin Yu stuck out his tongue and didn’t say anything more.

The few of them found a seat and sat down. It seemed that someone wanted to greet Wen Wanji, but because he saw Jue Wu beside him, he gave up in the end.

Qin Yu sat there bored to death, but Jue Wu was quite happy. She kept stuffing food into her mouth as if she hadn’t eaten for years.

“This place is too boring. Let’s Find a place to play,”Wen da poked Qin Yu’s shoulder and said.

Qin Yu nodded. This place was indeed too boring. The surrounding tables were all empty. It was enough to prove how much they feared Jue Wu.

Therefore, Qin Yu followed Wen Da and Wen Er to another table.

“City Lord, that Qin Yu is here too.”

At this moment, a young man not far away said to the person beside him.

This person was none other than the city lord of Gu City.

“What is this bastard doing here...”the city Lord’s face couldn’t help but turn black.

“Let’s go and look for him,”the person beside him said.

The city Lord hurriedly stopped him and said with a black face, “Are you crazy? Wen Wanyun is definitely here. You just offended him last time, and you still dare to go and look for him. Are you tired of living?”

After the city Lord’s Reminder, he also reacted.

“Wait, wait for the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect to come,”the city Lord said coldly.

“Yes.”

...

Wen Da and Wen Er knew a lot of people. Basically, they would greet each other wherever they went.

“Look, Li Yingying is also here.”Wen Er poked Wen da’s arm and said.

Wen Da swallowed his saliva and hurriedly ran over.

“Yingying, long time no see.”Wen Da said with a smile.

Li Yingying was startled by Wen Da. She turned around and rolled her eyes. “Why are you here?”

“Hehe, I’m Looking for you to play. We are old acquaintances.”Wen Da touched his nose and said.

As he said this, Wen da pulled Qin Yu to sit down.

There were many young talents at this table. It could be seen that they didn’t like Wen Da and Wen er very much.

“This should be brother Qin Yuqin.”At this time, someone at the table suddenly said.
