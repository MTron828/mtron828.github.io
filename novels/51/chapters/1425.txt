Chapter 1426: Chapter 1,426, re-entering Qingyan Forest 1

Xiao Hai was stunned for a moment before he laughed out loud, “You think I’m working for the Heavenly Cloud Sect?”

Qin Yu said, “Isn’t the Heavenly Cloud sect in charge of the Southern Region Now? If you help them get rid of the foreign lands, isn’t that the same as working for the Heavenly Cloud Sect?”

Xiao Hai shook his head and said, “You’re wrong. Regardless of whether it’s a war between sects or changes between regions, the ones who suffer are the lowest level cultivators and ordinary people.”

“Therefore, we must try our best to put an end to this kind of great war.”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “This is the golden age, and there are endless geniuses emerging. A Great War is inevitable.”

“Then let this day come a little later,”said Xiao Hai.

Qin Yu nodded. He understood Xiao Hai’s good intentions.

As long as he didn’t work for the Heavenly Cloud sect, it was good. At least he wouldn’t threaten his own safety.

As for what would happen in the future, no one could pry.

“Little brother, are you preparing to go to the Qingyan Forest?”Xiao Hai asked.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “I want to find something.”

Xiao Hai did not ask further. He only patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “If you need help, just let me know.”

Although that was the case, Qin Yu had never liked to ask for help, so he just cupped his hands and said, “Thank you very much, senior Xiao Hai.”

The group of people drank tea and ate some food before setting off.

They were not far from Qingyan Forest, only about ten stars away.

In the evening, Qin Yu rushed to the vicinity of Qingyan Forest.

As Zhuo Jing had said, there were more people gathered here than expected.

Many young people formed groups and stood there discussing something.

There were also some people waiting nearby to gather people and head to the Qingyan Forest together.

Qin Yu found a spot and looked at the Qingyan Forest.

It was pitch black and in the evening, it seemed even darker and more mysterious.

Many unspecialized people gathered people nearby. When their gazes fell on Qin Yu, they shook their heads.

Obviously, even if they were gathering their men, they still needed strong teammates.

People like Qin Yu, who didn’t have any spiritual energy fluctuation in his body, were naturally not welcome.

This group of people had gathered here and didn’t have the slightest intention of stepping into the Green Rock Forest.

Qin Yu was somewhat puzzled. He casually walked toward an unspecialized character and said, “What are you all waiting for? Why haven’t you set off yet?”

The unspecialized glanced at Qin Yu and said, “The sky is about to turn dark. Entering the Green Rock Forest at night is an extremely dangerous thing. Everyone is waiting for the morning.”

Qin Yu said in surprise, “The Green Rock Forest at night is especially dangerous? Why didn’t I Know About It?”

“I think it’s your first time here, right?”The unspecialized sized up Qin Yu and then said, “Even the hunter organization will try to avoid entering the green rock forest at night, let alone us.”

Qin Yu was even more surprised. He had been in the Hunter Organization for a long time, but he had never heard of this rule.

However, Guan Zhuang had said before that the green rock forest was extremely large, and they were only in a small area.

Perhaps this place was different from the hunter organization that Qin Yu had stayed in before.

For the sake of safety, Qin Yu decided to wait until dawn tomorrow before setting out, in case something unexpected happened at this time.

As night fell, the surroundings became much colder.

In the Green Rock Forest, the roars of demonic beasts could be heard from time to time, and even the sound of the earth shattering could be heard.

Such a commotion could not help but attract the attention of many people.

Qin Yu could not help but look into the depths of the Green Rock Forest. He activated the desolate God’s eye and looked straight into the green rock forest. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Under the gaze of the desolate God’s eye, these demonic beasts in the darkness had nowhere to hide.

Just as the itinerant cultivator had said, the demonic beasts in the darkness appeared even more manic, and the fluctuations of their auras were even more terrifying.

“It seems that this place is somewhat different from Guan Zhuang’s place,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

The Green Rock Forest was too big. It covered almost the entire holy region’s surroundings. No one knew what was hidden in the depths of the Green Rock Forest.

Since he wasn’t going, Qin Yu decided to find a place to rest.

At this moment, a male cultivator walked over from not far away.

He patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “Friend, are you alone too?”

Qin Yu glanced at him and nodded. “Yes, What’s Wrong?”

The cultivator smiled and said, “I don’t think you’re very strong. It’s dangerous to enter the green rock forest alone. Why Don’t you come with us? We can take care of each other.”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and was about to refuse when a few people walked over.

“Look, this is our team,”said the cultivator.

Qin Yu took a look and found that there were only four people in this so-called team. Moreover, they were not very strong, and their auras were quite ordinary.

“What... are your cultivations?”Qin Yu tried to ask.

The young man said, “We are all in the nascent soul realm. I’m the initiator, and also the strongest person in our team. Now, I’ve already stepped into the peak of the nascent Soul Realm.”

“Peak of the nascent Soul Realm...”Qin Yu murmured in a low voice.

“With your cultivations, isn’t the risk of entering the Green Rock Forest Too Great?”Qin Yu frowned and said.

The young man smiled and said, “Everyone is trying to make a living. Aren’t you the same?”
