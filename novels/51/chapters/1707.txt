Chapter 1708: The Dead River Disappears! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu knew that things were not looking good. He hesitated for a long time before he finally walked to the side of this young man with the surname Hu.

He patted the young man’s shoulder and said, “Stop swearing. Be careful.”

The young man with the surname Hu glanced at Qin Yu, and then pointed at He Teng and swore. “I’ll give this brother some face and let you off for the time being. Next time, you won’t be so lucky!”

Qin Yu felt speechless. He used his divine sense to scan the young man and found out this person had already stepped into the Mighty Realm.

Qin Yu was extremely surprised at his rate.

Could it be that the spiritual energy on Earth had recovered? Or had he been in the Holy Region for a long time?

Qin Yu pulled the young man to the side and asked him directly, “Are you also from Earth?”

The young man with the surname Hu was stunned. He sized up Qin Yu and said, “Brother, are you from Earth too?”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything.

As expected, this young man was from Earth.

Qin Yu didn’t answer his question but continued to ask, “How is the situation on Earth now? Is the cultivation environment better now?”

The young man shook his head and said, “Although it’s better than before, it is still not so good. After all, it’s caused by the overall situation.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “How long have you been in the Holy Region?”

“Almost a year,” said the young man. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Qin Yu suddenly saw the light.

No wonder! A great change in the world happened during this time. This young man did not come in time.

“How did you come to the Holy Region? Were you picked up by someone?” Qin Yu frowned.

He could not figure it out. There were not many sects with such strength in Nanzhou. Besides Tianyun Sect, Qin Yu could not think of another sect.

The young man said, “I relied on the Ancient Array Platform and got here by luck.”

“Ancient Array Platform…” Qin Yu muttered.

There were more than ten Ancient Array Platforms on Earth. If one relied on the array flags, they could indeed come to the Holy Region.

After that, Qin Yu asked about the situation on Earth.

From the conversation, he found out the young man’s name was Hu Xing. Before he came to the Holy Region, he had reached the Nascent Soul Realm.

This realm was unimpeded on Earth.

From the looks of it, the cultivation environment on Earth was probably much better than before.

“Be careful. After the death river disappears, He Teng won’t let you off,” Qin Yu patted his shoulder and said.

Hu xing sneered and said, “I’m not afraid of him. I indeed want to fight with him.”

“Don’t underestimate He Teng. His strength can’t be underestimated. Even I… Even Qin Yu can’t guarantee that he can defeat him,” Qin Yu said.

Hu Xing said with a slightly smug expression, “I don’t think my strength is below Qin Yu!”

Qin Yu smiled and did not say anything else.

He had said whatever he could. It was up to him to do what he wanted to do.

Qin Yu definitely would not ruin his own big plans because of him.

The number of people at the northern border was still increasing. At a glance, it was densely packed.

Once the dead river disappeared, it was likely that an unprecedented battle would occur.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly. He quietly released his divine sense and covered most of the people.

Soon, Qin Yu noticed an existence at the Reversion Void Stage in the crowd.

“A Reversion Void Stage cultivator indeed showed up,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

It seemed that Nanzhou did not lack ambitious people. There was only one possibility for the arrival of the Reversion Void Stage cultivator. He was aiming at Yuan Xiu!

He wanted to kill Yuan Xiu before he fully resurrected!

Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly and stopped thinking.

He knew that this matter was definitely not as simple as he had imagined. The success rate was extremely low.

Time passed by minute by minute, and the dead river disappeared at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Everyone’s heart was in their throats. They stared at the dead river closely. They were both excited and a little nervous.

Soon, Qin Yu found many familiar figures in the crowd.

These young men were all frequent guests of the Zhuo Jing family. Like Zhuo Jing, they were full of passion. Thus he was not surprised that they had come to the northern border.

Soon, the night fell.

The cold wind from North Plain made people shiver.

Qin Yu was well aware of the difficulties of cultivation and the harsh environment in North Plain. It was completely understandable that they wanted to leave North Plain.

However, the long-term distorted cultivation method made them unacceptable to others. The war was unavoidable.

At North Plain.

Sima Bei stood in the distance, coldly looking at the northern border.

His body was emitting an extremely cold internal qi. It was incomparably powerful. His vulture-like eyes were emitting an even colder gaze.

“This day has finally come.” Sima Bei took a deep breath, and a cold smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.

At this moment, Yong Ji walked out from the side.

He looked at Sima Bei and asked, “Are you going to the northern border tomorrow?”

Sima Bei looked at him and said indifferently, “I’ll leave such a good opportunity to you. Go and vent your anger.”

Yong Ji sneered and said, “Are you planning to stay and guard the iceberg?”

Sima Bei didn’t say anything, but his intention was very obvious.

Yong Ji said indifferently, “You’re indeed loyal.”

Sima Bei coldly glanced at Yong Ji and said, “Yong Ji, don’t think that just because you’ve stepped into the Reversion Void Stage, you’re qualified to be on par with the lord. There’s also a huge gap within the same cultivation stage.

“Just like how you still don’t dare to look for Xiao Sheng, who’s only at the half-step Reversion Void Stage, because there are some people that you’ll never be able to catch up to in your lifetime,” Sima Bei said indifferently.

Yong Ji’s expression turned cold as he coldly said, “Although I’m not their match, it doesn’t mean I’m not your match.”

Sima Bei glanced at Yong Ji, sneered, and said, “Don’t worry, I’ll give you a chance to compete.”

“I’m looking forward to it,” Yong Ji said coldly, turned around, and left.

…

Soon it was dawn.

Just as the dead river was about to disappear, everyone became much calmer. There was no more clamor of the past few days.

Time passed by minute by minute. Qin Yu closed his eyes and waited quietly.

“The dead river has disappeared!”

At this moment, someone shouted. The originally quiet northern border suddenly became lively.

Everyone stood up one after another. Their bodies emitted a strong battle intent!

Such a terrifying battle intent, even Qin Yu was moved by it!

In North Plain, Sima Bei had planned for the battle. Countless people were prepared to enter Nanzhou under the lead of Yong Ji!

“Everyone, be careful. Try your best not to step into North Plain. North Plain will suppress our strength. We won’t be able to unleash 30% of our strength!” Hu Xing stood up and shouted with all his might.

“He’s right. Mr. Xiao suffered such a loss previously!” Someone shouted as well.

“Kill them and avenge Mr. Xiao!” Hu Xing roared and once again ignited the flames of war to its peak!
