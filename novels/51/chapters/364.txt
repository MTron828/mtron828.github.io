Chapter 365: The Terrifying Cao Shan Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

As soon as Cao Shan finished speaking, he immediately clenched his fist and charged forward!

As a peak Inner Strength Grandmaster, his strength was beyond imagination!

Naturally, Qin Yu didn’t dare to be negligent. He hurriedly activated his Saintly Body Technique and sent a punch forward.

“Clang!”

With a loud sound, Qin Yu was forced back three steps!

Cao Shan’s situation wasn’t any better either. His wrist was in pain. He felt as if his fist had smashed into steel!

“Huh?” Cao Shan’s expression changed slightly.

An Inner Strength Past Master could actually withstand a punch from him?

What kind of talent was this?

Qin Yu wasn’t in the mood to fight. He said coldly, “Mr. Cao, if you want to take my life, why don’t you meet me somewhere? I won’t escape.”

“But now, I have something important to do. I have to leave immediately.”

Cao Shan laughed and said, “Do you think you have a right to bargain with me? If I don’t kill you, the person who will die will be me!”

With that said, Cao Shan stepped forward again!

Qin Yu knew that he was no match for Cao Shan, so he immediately planned to use the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique to escape.

However, Cao Shan seemed to have expected it. Just as Qin Yu was about to use the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique, the surrounding environment suddenly began to change.

The few of them seemed to have been put into an isolated space, completely isolated from the surroundings!

Qin Yu’s expression changed. He circulated all the spiritual power in his body and ruthlessly smashed towards his surroundings!

However, the surrounding walls seemed to have elasticity. When this punch landed, it only caused waves of ripples.

“Hehe, you want to run?” Cao Shan placed his hands behind his back and sneered repeatedly.

Qin Yu’s expression was somewhat unsightly.

Cao Shan’s ability had exceeded his imagination!

“Mr. Cao, do you have to kill me?” Qin Yu asked coldly.

Cao Shan sneered. “What do you think?”

“Okay.” Qin Yu knew that it would be difficult to escape today, so he took a deep breath and prepared to fight to the death.

Golden light burst out from his body, and his spiritual power was raised to the limit in an instant!

In the next second, Qin Yu’s mind moved, and the Purple Gold Gauze Cloth stood out from the Spatial Magic Artifact! Then, it covered Qin Yu’s entire body!

“Hmph, petty tricks.” Cao Shan didn’t take Qin Yu seriously at all.

With a light shake of his feet, he instantly arrived in front of Qin Yu!

Cao Shan’s fists were like dragons, and his entire body burst out with an imposing qi energy that pressed down on the entire space and caused it to buzz!

Qin Yu didn’t have any grand moves. He raised his hand and used the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist!

Golden light gathered on Qin Yu’s fist!

The strange power in his body erupted to the extreme at this moment!

“Go to h*ll!” Qin Yu raised his head and roared. His golden fist headed straight for Cao Shan’s vital point! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Qin Yu even gave up resisting and used his life-or-death method to exchange blows with Cao Shan!

Cao Shan sneered. “You don’t know your limits!”

As a peak Inner Strength Grandmaster, Cao Shan naturally wasn’t afraid of Qin Yu!

Boom!

Cao Shan’s fist smashed onto Qin Yu’s face!

Qin Yu’s Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist erupted on Cao Shan’s chest like a cannonball!

Swoosh!

Under this full force attack, Cao Shan’s entire body was sent flying!

His chest was even caved in, several of his ribs were broken, and a mouthful of blood spewed out from his mouth!

“How is this possible?!” Cao Shan’s expression was extremely ugly!

He couldn’t imagine that an Inner Strength Past Master would have such terrifying strength!

On the other hand, Qin Yu, under the cover of the Saintly Body Technique and the Purple Gold Gauze Cloth, had only received a superficial wound on his face.

“This is really unbelievable.” Cao Shan took a deep breath.

He climbed up from the ground and looked coldly at Qin Yu while saying, “Your strength has exceeded my imagination. No wonder that person wanted to kill you.”

Qin Yu’s breathing was slightly heavy. He gritted his teeth and looked at Cao Shan while saying, “Either let me go, or cut the crap!”

Cao Shan touched the blood that flowed out from the corner of his mouth. He put his hands behind his back and sneered. “I can see that you have reached your limit, but unfortunately, this is only the beginning.”

As his voice fell, Cao Shan’s qi energy suddenly erupted!

The strength of a peak Inner Strength Grandmaster was revealed at this moment!

“Roar...”

The space seemed to be unable to withstand the pressure, and a series of explosions sounded.

Even though Qin Yu’s physical body was powerful, under this pressure, he still felt as if his entire body was about to be crushed!

“I don’t want to waste time with you, so... I plan to kill you quickly.” Cao Shan’s voice and temperament changed.

With a shake of his feet, the space around Qin Yu seemed to be compressed!

His whole body immediately began to curl up, and the sound of cracking could be heard continuously!

“What... What’s going on...” Qin Yu felt as if his body was caught by an invisible hand, and he couldn’t move at all!

Cao Shan sneered. “This technique is called the Seven Capture Saint Technique. It’s a great honor to die under this technique.”

Qin Yu wasn’t in the mood to listen to Cao Shan’s nonsense. Golden light burst out from his body as he tried his best to resist this power!

Crack!

Following Qin Yu’s angry roar, the surrounding suppressive force seemed to have been shattered! Qin Yu’s physical body was also freed for a moment.

“To be able to resist the first capture, not bad.” Cao Shan nodded his head in praise.

“But what about the second capture?”

With that said, the pressure around Qin Yu once again pressed down!

This time, the pain was stronger than the previous time, and the strength was terrifying!

“Ah!!”

Qin Yu’s entire body was curled up bit by bit. Even if he tried his best to resist, he was still unable to break through this level of restraint.

“The third capture!” Cao Shan shouted again!

Qin Yu’s body suffered another heavy blow!

Several of his bones were shattered, and blood flowed out of his mouth and eyes!

“The fourth capture!” Cao Shan shouted again!

Qin Yu finally couldn’t take it anymore. He seemed to have lost his internal qi, and the qi energy in his entire body disappeared in an instant.

“Not bad, being able to withstand the fourth capture is already beyond my imagination.” Cao Shan quietly walked in front of Qin Yu.

At this moment, Qin Yu had already lost the ability to resist. His body was covered in blood as he fell to the ground.

Although he was still conscious, the pain in his body already made him unable to resist.

Cao Shan waved his hand, and the surrounding space began to disappear bit by bit.

Looking at Qin Yu, who had fallen to the ground miserable, Cao Shan muttered to himself, “Time to give up.”

In the study room of the Yan family’s manor, Yan Sihai was sitting in the seat where Old Mister Yan used to sit.

And Yan Ruoxue was sitting opposite him.

“Uncle, what do you want from me?” Yan Ruoxue asked with a cold expression.

Yan Sihai said with a faint smile, “Don’t worry, I have something important to discuss with you.”

At this moment, Yan Sihai’s phone rang.

He picked up the cell phone and saw that it was a video call from Cao Shan.
