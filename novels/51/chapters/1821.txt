1822 Dean Lei and Qin Yu’s Father

In the days after, Qin Yu locked himself in the cave abode all day to comprehend the Pure Heart Sutra.

With the Pure Heart Sutra, all the distractions Qin Yu had in mind were driven out. It was as if he had entered a no-man’s land.

Rumor had it that the Pure Heart Sutra had different effects for each individual. The peak was to enter the state of “selflessness”.

Under such a state, the advancement of the state of mind was extremely terrifying. The speed of cultivation also far exceeded what it had been before.

Although Qin Yu did not enter a selfless state, the distractions in his mind almost disappeared without a trace. Even his inner demons were almost completely suppressed.

For half a month, Qin Yu did not have the slightest urge to devour primordial spirits.

On this day, Qin Yu opened his eyes and heaved a relief. He felt as if his mind had been cleansed and extremely comfortable.

“In this case, I can try to enter closed-door cultivation,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

As for the closed-door cultivation location, Qin Yu had selected it earlier.

It was at the tomb of the Immortal Emperor.

As Thunder Courtyard was created by Immortal Emperor Lei, he was naturally buried there.

Of course, it was not easy to find the corpse of the Immortal Emperor. It was good enough to be able to cultivate nearby the tomb.

With the dark energy from the Immortal Emperor’s corpse and the dragon blood in Qin Yu’s hand, it was enough for him to step into the Reversion Void stage.

Therefore, Qin Yu got up and rushed to the cave abode of the peak master.

When Qin Yu arrived at the peak master’s cave abode, he was surprised to see Jiu Xiao.

Jiu Xiao had a close relationship with the peak master. Thus they were together almost every day.

Qin Yu walked forward and bowed slightly to Jiu Xiao to show his respect. He then looked at the peak master.

“What’s the matter?” the peak master asked without raising his head.

“I do have a favor to ask,” said Qin Yu in a deep voice.

The peak master was silent, waiting for Qin Yu to continue.

Qin Yu didn’t waste time and immediately stated his intention.

“I want to know where Immortal Emperor Lei’s tomb is,” Qin Yu said.

Upon hearing this, the originally calm peak master suddenly trembled.

The atmosphere of the entire cave abode also became strange.

“Do you know what you’re saying?” The peak master raised his head and looked at Qin Yu coldly.

“I don’t mean to be disrespectful,” Qin Yu said with a bitter smile. “I just need dark energy. I can’t find a better place than the Immortal Emperor’s tomb.”

Jiu Xiao, at the side, couldn’t help but sneer and say, “Go to the Immortal Emperor’s tomb to cultivate? How dare you? Do you know what Immortal Emperor is? It’s an existence that can make Holy Region disappear with a raise of a hand.”

“Let’s not talk about whether you’ll offend Immortal Emperor Lei or not. Even if Dean Lei is generous and agrees to your request, do you dare to go?” the peak Master said with a cold face. “Immortal Emperor is inviolable, and even his corpse is not something you can touch. A wisp of the internal qi from his corpse is enough to kill you a hundred times!”

Of course, Qin Yu understood. Thus he quickly explained, “Of course, I’m not qualified to enter the tomb of the Immortal Emperor. It’s enough as long as I can get close to it. I only need dark energy.”

“Because of chaotic body, right?” Jiu Xiao said indifferently.

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. “If you can’t accommodate my request, I’ll have to trouble Peak Master to find me another place.”

The peak master said with his face darkened, “Qin Yu, you think too highly of yourself. You want me to help you find a place, do you? On what basis?”

“I’m just begging,” Qin Yu said in neither an overbearing nor self-effacing manner.

The peak master coldly snorted and said, “Begging? Do you think I’ll agree to it?”

Qin Yu remained silent, not knowing how to respond.

“It’s enough,” the peak master said, somewhat annoyed. “Quickly get out. I can’t agree to this.”

Just then, Qin Yu suddenly laughed.

“Let’s do it this way,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

“If you can help me find a place to go, I promise I’ll get first place in the eight main peaks of Thunder Courtyard a year later. What do you think?” Qin Yu grinned and said. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The peak master laughed instead of getting angry.

He looked at Qin Yu with a teasing look and said, “Qin Yu, do you know what you’re saying? The first place of the eight main peaks? Do you know that even Jiu Xiao is only in fifth place?”

“I don’t care about others, I only care about myself,” Qin Yu said quietly.

Hearing Qin Yu’s words, the peak master became interested.

“You’re bragging,” he said as he stood up. “What makes you think you can get first place?”

“I’m confident,” Qin Yu’s answer was straightforward.

The peak master could not help but laugh. He looked at Jiu Xiao and said half-jokingly, “Jiu Xiao, did you hear that? A year later, he’s going to take away your title as the number one of Demon-slaying Peak.

“I don’t care about this bubble reputation,” Jiu Xiao said indifferently. “If he can do it, I’m happy for him.”

Then, the peak master looked at Qin Yu.

“What if you can’t do it?” he asked, raising his eyebrows.

“Do as you please,” Qin Yu said.

The peak master narrowed his eyes and said, “If you can’t do it, you’ll end your life and disappear a year later. You’ll also have to swear an oath on this. How about it?”

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

This curse was indeed vicious.

But soon, Qin Yu nodded, agreed, and said, “I’ll do as you say. I’ll swear an oath right now!”

As the saying “There is no construction without destruction.” No one in the entire Thunder Courtyard could break through the Reversion Void Stage and enter the True Saint stage within a year.

So long it was not a True Saint, Qin Yu was not afraid of anyone.

According to the peak master’s request, Qin Yu swore on the spot.

Both Jiu Xiao and the peak master frowned.

They didn’t expect Qin Yu to be serious.

After taking the oath, Qin Yu bowed slightly to the peak master and said, “Then I’ll have to trouble Peak Master.”

After saying that, Qin Yu turned around and walked out.

The peak master looked at Qin Yu’s back and couldn’t help but frown. “He’s really a madman.”

…

At the first main peak, Dean Lei’s eyes were slightly closed, and rays of light surrounded his body as if he was going to form an invincible golden body.

At this moment, an old man walked in.

He stood beside Dean Lei and whispered, “Qin Yu has exchanged for the Pure Heart Sutra,”

“The Pure Heart Sutra?” Dean Lei frowned slightly.

“That’s right. The purpose is very clear,” the old man said.

Dean Lei was silent for a while. He then sighed and said, “Speaking of which, he’s the first person to choose the Pure Heart Sutra.”

“Yes,” the person beside him smiled bitterly.

“Dean Lei, I don’t quite understand. Why are you so concerned about Qin Yu? Although he has a chaotic body, there are many unique physiques in the entire Holy Region. But only a handful has developed.”

Dean Lei glanced at him, stood up, and then said slowly, “I know his father.”

“His father?” The old man was stunned and frowned.

“His father… Who is he?”
