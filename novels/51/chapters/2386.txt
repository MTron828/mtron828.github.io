Flower Granny picked up the teacup and took a sip of the tea. She was silent for a long time before she spoke lowly.

“Yes. Many powerful individuals have emerged in the ghost realm over the years. The Five Great Ghost Emperors include Emperor Fengdu, the King of the Underworld, Yama, Shen Tu, and Soul Emperor Douluo. From the beginning of the Primordial Chaos, the demon race has had the continuous lineage of the ten sacred beasts and the four great divine beasts. They have even continuously given birth to new powerful races. The same goes for the monster race. However, under the suppression of Immortal Emperor Tianming, the strength of these alien races gradually waned, and the human race dominated a significant share of cosmic luck. Even during the Degenerate Age, there were formidable great cultivators like Wu Ji who could rival the Immortal Emperor, suppressing alien races and instilling tremendous fear among them.”

Lei Xin, Dean Lei, continued. The two rarely had the opportunity to sit together and talk about history.

“The human race in the past had a sense of crisis and united as one. Even if the alien races had a large number of people, they were still defeated one after another under the leadership of formidable great cultivators. During these few years of the Path of Heaven, the internal conflicts of the human race have intensified. Many people with great cosmic luck have been robbed of their money and plundered. If they don’t join the major forces, they will join hands to kill, causing them to lose their original cosmic luck. These ethereal ancient things seem to have gradually weakened the cosmic luck of the human race.”

Lei Xin nodded and said, “That’s right. The Path of Heaven of the demon, monster, and ghost races this time crushing the Path of Heaven of the human race is one of the situations. Perhaps the human race has occupied the great cosmic luck for too long. Now, the Path of Heaven is about to undergo a world-shaking change. We can only depend on the Golden Path of Heaven to see if anyone can lead us out of this predicament.”

The two were silent for a long time, and their expressions were solemn.

Humans killed each other to snatch mystic realms that appeared everywhere.

Perhaps many people had already seen through everything, like Flower Granny Hua and Lei Xin.

However, it was of no use. Most people in the world were like that. Even if there were people who had seen through it, they would not stop the overwhelming trend. This situation did not happen overnight but was a result of thousands of years of complacency among the human race.

It had been so long that almost everyone felt the human race would not face a crisis. Even at this moment, no one felt any imminent danger.

Just like in ancient times when the ghost race was about to be exterminated. All the people of the ghost race joined hands to resist the harsh environment in the polar dimensional plane and finally survived.

“It’s been a long time since the human race had an Immortal Emperor. It’s also one of the trials the human race has to endure. It’s also one of the tests that the Path of Heaven has bestowed on the human race. Whether it is a calamity or a blessing from the heavens remains unknown. In my view, this may be the key to the rise of the human race. Otherwise, how can the human race claim to be the pinnacle of all creations?”

An overbearing voice suddenly sounded from the side, and two figures slowly appeared in the space.

It was Si Liuhe who spoke, and Yan Tianshi stood beside him.

They represented the two most powerful families of the nine great aristocratic families, the Si family’s acting family head and the Yan family’s family head.

Si Liuhe’s body emitted a terrifyingly powerful internal qi despite he seemed to be suppressing it forcefully. After all, the Golden Path of Heaven Dao was still slowly descending. It would take a few days to release the suppression completely.

On the other hand, Yan Tianshi was like an ordinary person. He seemed to have hidden all his internal qi in his body and did not leak out at all.

“Are you two representing the nine great aristocratic families to declare war against my Thunder Courtyard?”

“Dean Lei, you’ve said it the other way round. It’s Thunder Courtyard that wants to start a war with the nine great aristocratic families. You forcefully kidnapped the saintess of the Yan family and banished the criminal Qin Yu. Isn’t this too disrespectful to the nine great aristocratic families? We respect Dean Lei and Flower Granny. Otherwise, it won’t just be the two of us who come the next time.”

Si Liuhe said calmly.

Lei Xin stood up and did not give in at all.

Yan Tianshi said softly.

“I heard that when Grandmaster Si became the True Saint, he lost to the dean in a Dao discussion. Today, I think I’ll exchange a move with Flower Granny before discussing anything else.”

Yan Tianshi put his palms together and suddenly crossed his fingers.

His body seemed to have lost all its internal qi in an instant, and a light shadow flashed out of his body.

He arrived in front of Flower Granny as swiftly as a fleeting reflection on the water’s surface.

This light shadow was Yan Tianshi’s consciousness.

At their level, they would normally only use their consciousness to fight, not the real combat, just like Si Liuhe and Lei Xin discussing the Dao while playing chess, unless they had a deadly grudge.

Otherwise, a battle of similar cultivation realms would affect too many things, and no one could tell if the other party had a desperate killing move.

Flower Granny revealed a solemn expression and closed her eyes.

Similarly, a palm directly met that consciousness in an instant.

Lei Xin and Si Liuhe retreated a thousand meters away. A pagoda appeared in Lei Xinlei’s hand.

Eight massive rays of light shot out in all directions, stabilizing the space.

The fluctuations caused by the clash of consciousness were originally very minimal, but at this moment, Lei Xin dared not relax at all. After all, they were in Thunder Courtyard, and all the casualties would be the people of Thunder Courtyard. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

A storm suddenly blew up in the open space. Thousands of sharp spatial blades appeared in the void with razor-sharp edges and started to attack.

In the distance, the space where Flower Granny Hua and Dean Lei were was as if having a world-destroying downpour.

Every raindrop was a spatial blade that could cut through divine weapons.

“What a terrifying comprehension of the spatial rules! I’m afraid that the Holy Lord of the Yan family will break through directly when the golden age is fully unleashed.”

Lei Xin looked at the two with a solemn expression.

Flower Granny’s true body was inflicted with numerous wounds. Lei Xin’s body moved, but he managed to restrain it with great effort. In this kind of Dao discussion, it would be equivalent to admitting defeat when one interfered, which would be too disadvantageous for the subsequent negotiations.

Suddenly, killing intent surged again in the Path of Heaven’s sea of space.

An enormous bubble emerged. Under the river of space, a hidden statue suddenly opened its eyes.

Taking advantage of the situation, a large mouthful of energy entered his mouth.

A surge of energy entered Yan Tianshi’s body almost at the same time.

It was a power that was triggered by consciousness. The power would be dozens of times greater if it were triggered by the true body.

“Dean Lei, please calm down.”

Si Liuhe said softly, looking at Lei Xin.

Lei Xin frowned deeply. Yan Tianshi had actually condensed into a soul statue. This was already the prerequisite for the second stage of the Tribulation Transcending Stage!
