Chapter 254: War God, Ye Qing! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Although Dong Tianhai had already guessed it, he still felt extremely regretful when he received the definite answer!

He hurriedly said, “Mr. Qin, I’m willing to offer two herbs in exchange for your Nine Transformation Golden Pill!”

Qin Yu sneered. “Forget it.”

Previously, Qin Yu didn’t know the value of the Nine Transformation Golden Pill, so he agreed to Dong Tianhai’s offer.

Now, Qin Yu didn’t lack Dong Tianhai’s two herbs at all.

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and left.

Dong Tianhai’s expression was extremely unsightly. He stood there for a long time without saying a word.

“Master, what do we do now?” Dong Tianhai’s disciple asked.

Dong Tianhai slowly said, “It’s karma...”

...

After obtaining the Divine Medicine, Qin Yu prepared to leave.

“Mr. Qin, if you have time, come to Jiang Bei to find me,” Fang Yue said with a smile.

Qin Yu said with a wry smile, “I’m afraid I won’t be able to go there for a while.”

After all, he had offended Gu Jinhong’s master. If he went to Jiang Bei, who knew what would happen?

Fang Yue seemed to have guessed it as well. She said with a light smile, “Alright, we’ll meet again if we’re fated.”

“We’ll meet again if we’re fated.” Qin Yu nodded slightly.

After parting ways, Qin Yu drove Jiang Gu back.

On the way, Qin Yu glanced at Jiang Gu through the rearview mirror and said with a smile, “Don’t worry, I won’t let you come all this way for nothing.”

Although the Divine Medicine was good, he couldn’t claim it all for himself.

Moreover, Jiang Gu was willing to help Qin Yu at a critical life or death moment. Qin Yu would never forget this favor.

“I promise to let you advance to the second or even third level Inner Strength Grandmaster realm in the near future,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

When he heard this, Jiang Gu was instantly overjoyed!

To him, a first level Inner Strength Grandmaster was probably already a bottleneck. He might not even be able to advance one step further in this lifetime!

Jiang Gu said with a face full of gratitude, “Thank you, Mr. Qin!”

It seemed that the Jiang family didn’t make the wrong bet this time.

...

After returning to Bai City, the first thing Qin Yu did was to look at his vegetable garden.

When he walked into the vegetable garden, he saw that there was nothing in it.

“What... what happened?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel stunned.

“Yao Qing! Where’s my medicine?!” Qin Yu said angrily to the house.

After a while, Yao Qing ran out of the room.

He said awkwardly, “Mr. Qin, I used all the medicine... I couldn’t help myself.”

Qin Yu took a closer look. Sure enough, Yao Qing’s strength had improved a lot.

He had successfully reached the realm of Inner Strength Master Hands.

“You won’t blame me, right?” Yao Qing said with an embarrassed smile.

Qin Yu waved his hand helplessly and said, “Forget it. If you ate it, so be it.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“I originally planned to give you a portion of this once in a thousand year Divine Medicine, but now it’s better to forget it.”

When he heard the last sentence, Yao Qing even wanted to die!

...

The news of Qin Yu slaughtering everyone in the deep mountains quickly spread.

The news of one of the four great geniuses of the Jiang Bei region kneeling down and Gu Jinhong being beheaded spread quickly.

Everyone became more and more curious about Qin Yu.

They even guessed that Qin Yu was the Yan family’s eye in the Jiang Bei region.

One afternoon, a car suddenly drove in from outside.

As soon as the car stopped, they saw Mr. Wu come down.

Then, Xiao Yu jumped down and followed.

“Qin Yu!”

As soon as she saw Qin Yu, Xiao Yu’s face was filled with excitement.

She walked over with an internal qi of the pugilistic world and pounded Qin Yu’s chest. She said, “You’re quite impressive. As expected of the man that Ruoxue has taken a fancy to!”

Qin Yu rolled her eyes and said, “You’re just a child. Why are you pretending to be mature?”

“You’re the one who’s a child! I’m not a child anymore, okay?!” Xiao Yu deliberately puffed out her chest.

Hmm, she really wasn’t a child. This little girl was quite well-developed.

“Alright, stop pestering Qin Yu.” Mr. Wu waved his hand and said.

Xiao Yu rolled her eyes at Mr. Wu and muttered, “I’m not pestering him...”

Qin Yu welcomed Mr. Wu into the house and personally poured him a cup of tea.

Mr. Wu took a sip and couldn’t help but sigh, “Qin Yu, speaking of which, I really find it unbelievable.”

“When I saw you half a year ago, you were just a down-and-out son-in-law who had just been kicked out of the house, but now you have such an achievement. Miss Yan’s judgment is really sharp.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Everything that happened is due to pure luck. It’s not worth mentioning.”

“Luck?” Mr. Wu force a smile.

People could rely on luck, but they definitely wouldn’t go too far.

It was even more impossible for them to become the top dog in Chuzhou like Qin Yu, who could even suppress the four great geniuses of the Jiang Bei region.

“Mr. Wu, why are you looking for me?” Qin Yu said.

Mr. Wu nodded and said, “I do have something to ask you.”

“You want to invite me into the military district?” Qin Yu guessed.

Mr. Wu was stunned. He said in surprise, “How did you know?”

“I guessed.” Qin Yu smiled.

Mr. Wu sighed and said, “As your fame grew, the relevant departments also noticed you.”

“Now, the higher-ups have given me an order. No matter what method is used, you must be recruited to join the military district.”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and smiled, “I can agree to it, but I have conditions.”

Mr. Wu was delighted and quickly said, “You say, as long as I can do it within my authority, I will agree to it!”

Qin Yu said in a sullen voice, “First, I can only go once in a while to maintain my freedom. Of course, I won’t ask for a position.”

“Second, I won’t stay in Chuzhou forever, or even in Jiang Bei, so I might not return to Chuzhou for a long time in the future.”

Mr. Wu was silent for a moment. He thought for a moment and said, “I can promise you that since the military district of Jingdu can give Ye Qing such conditions, our military district of Chuzhou can do the same.”

“Ye Qing?” Qin Yu was stunned.

He had heard this name many times, but he didn’t know him at all.

“Who exactly is Ye Qing?” Qin Yu asked.

Mr. Wu asked in surprise, “You don’t know Ye Qing?”

“I don’t know.” Qin Yu shook his head.

At the mention of Ye Qing, Mr. Wu’s face was filled with admiration.

“Ye Qing is the same as you. Although he was born in Jingdu, he doesn’t have any prominent background,” Mr. Wu said slowly.

“When he first showed his edge, he was suppressed by the aristocratic families of Jingdu.”

“But under this suppression, he still became a hero of his generation! He even surpassed all the major families!”

“And after he joined the military district, he became known as the War God!”

At this point, Mr. Wu paused. He looked at Qin Yu and said with a smile, “To tell you the truth, back then, Miss Yan said that you would become the next Ye Qing.”

“At that time, I didn’t take it seriously, but now, I’m starting to believe it.”

Qin Yu touched his chin and whispered, “Ye Qing... I’ll remember this name.”
