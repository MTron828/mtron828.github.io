1770 Jue Wu’s Breakthrough

The girl was panting. She stood before Qin Yu and pointed at the girl next to her. “Perhaps Xiaoqian can help you…”

“Mr. Qin,” the girl named Xiaoqian bowed slightly to Qin Yu and greeted him.

Qin Yu looked at her and asked in surprise, “You can help? Do you know what this is about?”

Xiaoqian smiled and said, “Of course, but… This doesn’t seem to be a good place to talk. Why don’t we go to another place?”

!!

Qin Yu looked to the side and saw a restaurant nearby.

Therefore, he invited Xiaoqian and the girl from before to the restaurant.

He asked Wen Da and Wen Er to find a room for themselves and then took the two girls into another private room.

“Damn it. This brat is taking two girls by himself!” Wen Da said with an indignant expression.

“Exactly! It’s fine if the girls don’t like you, but I’m so handsome, and they still ignore me. Damn it!” Wen Er muttered.

“Go to hell!”

After chatting, Qin Yu found out that the lady’s name was Wanru, and she had just arrived at Dayue Mountain.

However, Xiaoqian was different from the other girls in the brothel.

The reason why she came to this kind of place was actually to cultivate.

She was cultivating a kind of evil technique. According to Xiaoqian, this kind of Dao technique was passed down from her ancestors and could not be changed. She had to rely on the essence qi of men to cultivate it.

After hearing their self-introductions, Qin Yu couldn’t wait to ask, “Xiaoqian, you said you could help me. How exactly are you going to help?”

“I can help you, but I have a condition,” Xiaoqian answered with a faint smile.

“Just say it.” Qin Yu quickly nodded.

Xiaoqian replied indifferently, “I’ve also said that my cultivation relies on a man’s essence. The stronger the man, the greater the improvement. So, I want you to sleep with me this time.”

Qin Yu’s face darkened.

“Maybe some other conditions?” he asked.

Xiaoqian shook her head and replied with a smile, “Other than this, I don’t have any other requests.”

Qin Yu frowned and was caught in a dilemma.

He did need to recover his primordial spirit as soon as possible to prevent his cultivation from falling behind.

But sleeping with someone else was too much for him. He would probably be condemned for the rest of his life.

“How about this? I can’t help you with my current body. When I recover in the future, I can agree to your request.” Qin Yu gave an ambiguous answer after much thought.

“Is that true?” Xiaoqian raised her eyebrows.

“It’s true.” Qin Yu nodded quickly. “If you don’t believe me, I can swear an oath.”

“There is no need for that. I believe in Mr. Qin’s character.” Xiaoqian refused.

Finishing, she told Qin Yu about her experience.

Because of her unique way of cultivation, she met many people who were on the evil path.

These people all had very special cultivation methods. Some relied on absorbing men’s essence qi like Xiaoqian, while others absorbed other people’s divine sense like Yuan Xiu.

The method that Xiaoqian had told him was similar to the cultivation of Yuan Xiu.

That was to seize the primordial spirit of others to repair his primordial spirit as soon as possible.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown after hearing what Xiaoqian said.

Absorbing the primordial spirit of others was a great taboo in the Holy Region. He would be listed as evil, and he would likely be killed by people with justice.

However, he badly needed to restore his primordial spirit. He could not think of any other solution except this.

“I know that you, Mr. Qin are a great hero and a man of justice. I am afraid you look down on us lowly people,” Xiaoqian mocked with a self-deprecating tone.

“So, it’s up to you to decide what you want to do.”

After saying this, she pulled Wanru up and was about to leave.

“Wait a minute.” Qin Yu finally stopped her.

A trace of viciousness flashed across his face, and then he said coldly, “What do I need to do?”

Xiaoqian sat down again and slowly answered, “Devouring the primordial spirit of others requires a special technique, and this technique is only controlled by one of my friends.”

“Then, can you get in touch with this friend? If we manage to get in touch with him, will he be willing to help?” Qin Yu asked with a frown.

“Of course.” Xiaoqian nodded slightly.

“But it will take a few days.”

“About how long?” asked Qin Yu.

“No more than ten days,” Xiaoqian replied.

Qin Yu nodded slightly. He looked at Xiaoqian and said, “Then I’ll have to trouble you. I owe you a favor.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“That’s not necessary. It’s a deal between us anyway. As long as you don’t go back on your word, it’s fine,” Xiaoqian said with a smile.

Qin Yu nodded and continued, “I’ll come here to find you in ten days, or you can come to Dayue Mountain to find me.”

“All right.” Xiaoqian agreed.

After coming out of the private room, Qin Yu felt extremely conflicted.

He didn’t want to cultivate such a technique, and he didn’t want to steal the primordial spirit of others.

But now, he had no other solution except for this.

When his heart softened, he couldn’t help but think of another chaotic body.

“Forget it!” Qin Yu gritted his teeth.

As long as it was for Yan Ruoxue, he would accept being treated as a devil!

He made up his mind and stopped thinking about it.

When he arrived at the private room of Wen Da and Wen Er, the two had already started drinking.

Seeing Qin Yu walk in, Wen Da joked, “Oh, it seems that the duration is shorter than the last time.”

“Yeah. It seems you are not strong enough,” Wen Er muttered drunkenly.

“Let’s go home.” Qin Yu waved his hand and spoke.

Although Wen Da and Wen Er were reluctant, they followed Qin Yu back to Dayue Mountain.

When Qin Yu stepped into Dayue Mountain Villa, dark clouds gathered at the mountain’s peak, lightning flashed, and thunder rumbled.

“The tribulation is about to begin,” Wen Da said in a deep voice.

“It’s Auntie Jue Wu. She’s finally about to step into the Reversion Void Stage.”

Qin Yu could not help but look up at the dark clouds and the heavenly tribulation slowly brewing.

“A heavenly tribulation of this scale is probably not any weaker than Xiao Sheng’s,” Qin Yu couldn’t help but think.

Although Jue Wu looked carefree, her talent was terrifying. She was probably no worse than the Xiao brothers.

Wen Wanchong and Qu Zhu also looked up at the cloudy sky.

“As expected of Lord Jue Wu,” Wen Wanchong said respectfully.

Qu Zhu didn’t say anything, and no one knew what he was thinking.

This heavenly tribulation was even more terrifying than everyone had imagined.

Usually, there would be nine bolts of heavenly tribulation. One could successfully breakthrough as long as one survived these nine bolts of heavenly tribulation.

And these nine bolts of heavenly tribulation would take at most a day.

However, Jue Wu faced a total of eighteen bolts of heavenly tribulations! And it took three days to pass the tribulation.

Three days later, the dark clouds in the sky slowly dispersed.

For a moment, everyone present was shocked.
