Chapter 980: Chapter 980, the Terrified Heavenly Blood Rainbow!

The figure floated in mid-air. It looked like a fairy that did not exist in the mortal world, but also like a demon from the nine serenities hell.

“It’s... It’s You!”

Upon seeing this figure, the Heavenly Blood Rainbow’s pupils dilated! His body trembled like a sieve!

“Eh? Little... Little Fish?”Qin Yu could not help but widen his eyes.

He stood up to greet little fish, but he found that he didn’t have the strength to stand up at all.

“Iron egg, hurry up and help me!”Qin Yu hurriedly shouted at Iron Egg.

However, iron egg didn’t say a word, as if he had fallen into silence.

“Iron Egg?”Qin Yu tried to shout again, but there was still no response.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He could only do his best and shout in the direction of little fish.

However, “Xiao Yu”didn’t pay attention to Qin Yu. He just looked down at the Sky Blood Rainbow.

The Sky Blood Rainbow’s face was pale and his body was trembling.

It was unknown whether it was because of fear or something else, but he was like Qin Yu. His legs were weak and he couldn’t stand up at all!

“You... how can you still be alive...”the sky blood rainbow’s lips trembled as he said in a trembling voice.

Little Fish remained silent. That powerful pressure made everyone physically afraid.

The Sky Blood Rainbow wanted to get up many times, but he realized that his legs were completely out of control.

He knelt on the ground and said in a trembling voice, “I... I was wrong. Forgive me, forgive me...”

Hearing this, everyone was stunned.

The Sky Blood Rainbow actually knelt down and begged for mercy?

Who was that woman in midair?

“I was wrong. I beg you to spare my life...”tears actually flowed out of Tian Xuehong’s eyes.

He knelt on the ground, his head hanging on the ground, not daring to raise his head at all.

“I didn’t know you were still alive. The immortal slaying sect is gone. Please let me go...”Tian Xuehong cried bitterly.

Xiao Yu didn’t say anything. She raised her hand, and the dozens of white bones instantly turned into ashes!

Then, Xiao Yu’s hands slowly slid in the air. No one knew what kind of spell she was using.

A moment later, the light pillars began to collapse!

One, two, three... Eight light pillars disappeared without a trace!

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown. “Iron Egg, didn’t you say that this spell couldn’t be stopped? Didn’t it F * cking stop?”

However, iron egg still didn’t say a word. No matter what Qin Yu shouted, he didn’t have the slightest reaction. It was as if he had fallen into a deep sleep.

At this moment, heavenly blood rainbow was still kneeling on the ground. He kept shivering and didn’t even dare to raise his head.

If there was even the slightest bit of movement, Heavenly Blood Rainbow’s entire body would tremble.

After doing all this, Little Fish’s gaze in midair looked coldly at Heavenly Blood Rainbow.

Although it was just a glance, it completely shattered the mental defenses of the Sky Blood Rainbow.

He seemed to have gone mad as he started to run. As he ran, he roared crazily, “She’s still alive, she’s still alive, Hahaha... She’s still alive...”

He didn’t know if he had really gone mad, or if he was deliberately using this opportunity to escape.

In short, the Sky Blood Rainbow disappeared without a trace, and his white bone army was completely shattered.

Dozens of mighty figures had turned into nothingness in an instant.

Qin Yu raised his head to look at Little Fish who was in the air. He could not help but be dumbstruck.

He had risked his life to cut off two of his arms. She had merely raised her hand and these mighty figures had been shattered?

It was not just Qin Yu. Everyone present was shocked!

With such methods, he was most likely no longer a martial saint!

After doing all this, Little Yu slowly turned around as if she wanted to leave.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and shouted with all his might, “Little Yu!”

This roar seemed to have used up all of Qin Yu’s strength.

Little Yu, who was in mid-air, stopped in her tracks.

However, after only stopping for half a second, she turned around and left, disappearing without a trace.

Qin Yu lay on the ground, unable to help but feel mixed emotions.

Was She Xiao Yu or the legendary masked woman?

If she was Xiao Yu, why didn’t she say anything? If she wasn’t, why did she stop for half a second?

“Qin Yu!”

Kong Yun ran to Qin Yu’s side quickly and helped him up.

“How are you?”Asked Kong Yun.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I’m fine.”

“Who was that person just now?”Yao Meng couldn’t help but ask.

The person she was talking about was naturally Xiao Yu.

“If I’m not wrong, it should be the little girl who was with you before,”Kong Yun said in a deep voice.

“It seems that she was also the one who subdued the two corpses last time.”

Qin Yu nodded, but at this moment, Qin Yu didn’t dare to guarantee that it was still Xiao Yu, and he didn’t know if she still recognized him.

“It’s finally over.”Everyone present couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief.

Looking at the disappearing pillar of light, the huge rock weighing down on everyone’s hearts finally fell to the ground.

Some cheered, some felt their legs go weak, and some just wanted to go home.

Qin Yu waved his hand at Kong Yun and the others and said, “Bring me back to nine pinnacles mountain first...”

The few of them acknowledged him and brought Qin Yu up to nine Pinnacles Mountain.

After arriving at nine Pinnacles Mountain, Qin Yu was so tired that he couldn’t open his eyes. He quickly fell asleep.

After experiencing this incident, the reputation of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association had plummeted.

If it weren’t for Zhai Xing taking action at a critical moment to save some face for the JINGDU martial arts association, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association would definitely have aroused public anger.

In the office.

Gu Xinghe looked at the video at the scene and couldn’t help but frown. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The masked woman in the video made Gu Xinghe feel a sense of danger.

The most important thing was that the woman knew Qin Yu.

“Young Master.”At this moment, Long Mei walked in.

“How is it? Have you found out?”Gu Xinghe hurriedly asked.

Long Mei nodded and placed the document in front of Gu Xinghe. He said, “Her appearance is very similar to that of a legendary person. It is said that... the massacre immortal sect was destroyed by her.”

“There are many legends about her. This is the relevant document. You can take a look.”

Gu Xinghe quickly picked up the document and read it carefully.

There were many records about the masked woman in the document, and the more Gu Xinghe read, the more shocked he became.
