Xiao Cheng knew something was wrong. He didn’t expect Qin Yu to have so many tricks up his sleeve!

“Divine Judgment!”

Before Xiao Cheng could react, Qin Yu had already used Divine Judgment again!

The space between Qin Yu’s eyebrows suddenly lit up, and a sharp blade flew towards Xiao Cheng at an extremely fast speed!

“Oh no!”

Xiao Cheng didn’t dare to be negligent and hurriedly retreated! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

However, the Divine Judgement was too fast. Even though Xiao Cheng was fast, he was still slashed away by the sword!

“Slash!”

Xiao Cheng’s head felt like it suffered a heavy blow. However, what shocked Qin Yu was that this attack didn’t take Xiao Cheng’s life. It only damaged his divine sense!

“Qin Yu, the Hong Yi Sect will remember this grudge. Next time, the Hong Yi Sect definitely won’t be merciful to you!” Xiao Cheng said and hurriedly fled!

The divine seal that was pressed on Qin Yu’s body was also withdrawn. By the time Qin Yu regained his freedom, Xiao Cheng had already disappeared.

“I can’t believe I didn’t manage to kill him.” Qin Yu frowned.

As expected, there were no invincible spells in this world.

However, Qin Yu’s target wasn’t Xiao Cheng, but Cao Shan.

Updates by

After killing Cao Shan, Qin Yu hung his corpse on the gate of the Cao family, then turned around and left.

His actions naturally made all the sects in Yunchuan City tremble with fear!

The Cao family, which had been dominating Yunchuan for so many years, had fallen just like that!

Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry to leave Yunchuan.

His plan hadn’t been officially carried out, so he wasn’t in a hurry to leave.

That night, Qin Yu found a hotel and temporarily stayed there.

At night, Qin Yu tried to post a post, similar to the Yan family’s, on the Martial Arts Forum:

‘From today onwards, Qin Yu will recruit all the sages in the world.’

After that, Qin Yu wrote a post that was extremely emotional.

Currently, Qin Yu had already become a hot topic on the Martial Arts Forum.

As long as it was related to him, almost all the posts would attract attention.

Therefore, this post quickly caused a sensation.

Countless comments flooded in like a tide.

“Qin Yu actually wants to establish a sect. Does he want to face the Yan family head-on?”

“Qin Yu is the only person who dares to challenge an aristocratic family. He represents the power of the bottom class.”

“Not only that, but he is also an elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion and possesses the Meridian Circulation Technique obtained by the stairway to heaven. To be honest, I am a little excited.”

The comments were mixed. Some people were excited, while others naturally weren’t optimistic.

While everyone was discussing fervently, a person with the ID “Han Wei” posted a comment below.

“Everyone here has thought it through. Anyone who is related to Qin Yu is the enemy of the Han family and the Yan family.”

“Besides... Qin Yu won’t be able to live much longer. In four months, at my wedding with Yan Ruoxue, I will personally kill Qin Yu as a congratulatory gift.”

The moment this comment appeared, the comments immediately became one-sided.

Those who had supported Qin Yu earlier were instantly discouraged.

There were even people who deleted the comment because they were afraid that they would be targeted by this great aristocratic family.

Looking at everyone’s attitude, he couldn’t help but smile bitterly.

He put down his hand and sighed softly. “It seems that I have underestimated the importance of these aristocratic families in everyone’s hearts.”

Everyone was already used to the aristocratic families being high and mighty. Who would be willing to take that risk?

“The Martial Arts Forum is indeed not a feasible means,” Qin Yu thought inside.

Although Qin Yu had repeatedly done things that shocked the world, in reality, it didn’t affect the aristocratic families at all.

The Yan and Han families hadn’t used their trump cards yet. Otherwise, how could Qin Yu have survived until today?

Qin Yu didn’t sleep that night.

He looked at the various comments and news on the Martial Arts Forum and a worried expression appeared on his face.

Late at night, the Martial Arts Forum was still bustling with activity.

At this moment, another post was posted.

The content of this post was even more shocking!

The person who posted it was the manager of the Martial Arts Forum!

The title of the post was “The New Era’s Leading Youth” and the main character of the post was actually Han Wei!

“Han Wei broke through today and stepped into the half-step Martial Marquis realm!”

Half-step Martial Marquis realm!

Although it wasn’t really the Martial Marquis realm, as long as one was associated with the title ‘Martial Marquis’, the gap between them and the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm would be widened!

The higher the realm, the more obvious the gap would be!

A Inner Strength Grandmaster could kill a hundred Inner Strength Past Masters.

But as long as there were enough Inner Strength Past Masters, there was still a slight chance of victory.

But in front of a Martial Marquis, no matter how many Inner Strength Past Masters there were, there was no chance of victory at all!

He continued to read the thread and there was a video of Han Wei’s exclusive interview.

In the video, Han Wei first expressed the difficulty of his cultivation path.

And very soon, Han Wei changed the topic to Qin Yu.

“Mr. Han, you and Miss Yan are both blessed. Your wedding has received a lot of attention from the outside world. Can you tell us about it?” The host asked.

Han Wei smiled and said, “Of course.”

“Miss Yan and I are childhood sweethearts. We have known each other since we were young and have been in love for many years. We are a match made in heaven.”

“However, something unexpected happened. No one expected that a man named Qin Yu would interfere.”

Han Wei’s expression turned gloomy when he said this.

He pretended to be angry and said, “Qin Yu pestered my fiancée relentlessly. He even went to the Yan family to make trouble!”

“Old Mister Yan didn’t bother with him because he was young. He even gave him a mouthful of food. Who knew Qin Yu was an ingrate?!”

“Not only did he not appreciate his kindness, but he even caused Old Mister Yan’s death! My fiancée and I are extremely angry about this! Especially my fiancée, who cries everyday!”

Qin Yu’s expression couldn’t help but turn ashen as he gnashed his teeth.

When he heard the words “fiancée” from Han Wei’s mouth, Qin Yu almost lost his mind!

“He’s distorting the truth and stirring up trouble!” Qin Yu said angrily.

“Mister Han, with the power of the Han family, it should be effortless for you to deal with Qin Yu, right?” The host continued.

Han Wei nodded and said, “Indeed, in front of the Han family, he is nothing, but some people aren’t capable enough and like to blame their background instead.”

“Qin Yu is like a vicious dog. He keeps blackmailing me and claims that he wants to openly fight one-on-one with me.”

“As the young master of the Han family, I shouldn’t lower myself to his level. However, my fiancée hates him to the bone, so I also want to avenge my fiancée.”

Speaking up to this point, Han Wei stared at the screen and said indifferently, “Qin Yu, you will pay the price for your actions. I also hope that you can do your best. Don’t disappoint me too much.”

Looking at Han Wei on the screen, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

“What? After stepping into the half-step Martial Marquis realm, you’re full of confidence, aren’t you?” Qin Yu murmured in a low voice.

He immediately picked up his phone and posted a comment, “Han Wei, see you in four months.”
