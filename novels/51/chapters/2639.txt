Chapter 2640: Defeating Gu Tian

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The saber was aimed at Gu Tian’s head. With a little force, it could split his head open.

“Kill him or not?”

The Saber-Cultivating Ancient Demon asked expressionlessly.

“Forget it. Once we kill him, I’m afraid that old fellow will never let us off. Now is not the time. We just need to leave some traces behind.”

Wu Tian Ancient Demon shook his head.

“Seeking death! Do you think I, Gu Tian, would spare an incomplete ancient demon like you?”

Fleeing Shadow!

Gu Tian was furious. With a swift movement, he appeared in front of the Saber-Cultivating Ancient Demon.

The holy light divine flames in his hands converged between his fingers and attacked the Saber-Cultivating Ancient Demon.

The divine flame sensed the powerful demonic qi in front of it and exploded, transforming from a small flame into an extremely compressed fireball. The holy light divine flames surged toward the Saber-Cultivating Ancient

Demon like a wave, enveloping him tightly.

Within the encircling flames, the flames continued to surge, washing over the body of the Saber-Cultivating Ancient Demon.

Even though Qin Yu was several hundred meters away from the fireball, he could still feel the heat. Fôll0w current novÊls on n/o/(v)/3l/b((in).(co/m)

Avici Dao’s Three Blades!

Within the fireball, saber lights suddenly gleamed.

This saber light was like lightning, its momentum akin to the wind.

As the attack was unleashed, the divine flames within the fireball trembled violently.

After this strike, it seemed as if a storm had erupted within the entire circle of divine flames. Instead of subsiding after the strike, the storm of saber aura intensified even more.

Whoosh!

After a breath, the encircling flames were completely extinguished.

After a brief calm, a huge storm suddenly arose around Gu Tian. A saber light lit up from the storm and severed one of his hands.

“You are Saber Demon Pang De!”

Gu Tian’s face turned pale. Suddenly, another figure appeared, merging with the one in front of him.

“It’s this little fellow. Interesting.” Immortal Emperor Yao smiled.

“Who is this guy?”

Qin Yu was curious. Someone who could leave an impression on Immortal Emperor Yao wasn’t simple.

“This person is a wanderer who roams the world of the Saints. He accidentally entered the profound Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom and comprehended the Order of Saint Kingdom here, creating the Avici Dao’s Three Sabers. However, because his dao technique was integrated into the core Order of the Sacred Kingdom, the Avici Dao’s Three Blades developed its own will. Consequently, it was controlled by the Dao technique and became an ancient demon that had lost its consciousness. However, from the looks of it now, it seems to have recovered some of its consciousness.”

Immortal Emperor Yao explained.

Qin Yu was somewhat shocked. The core Order of Saint Kingdom was the most powerful principle in this Saint Kingdom, yet this unremarkable ancient demon possessed such terrifying strength.

Ling Bo!

Gu Tian didn’t dare to continue his pretense. He used the Ling Bo Technique again, swiftly fleeing from the scene.

“Why didn’t you kill him? With your current strength, I’m afraid you could completely crush Gu Yi, right?”

Pang De frowned.

“Don’t forget that behind Gu Yi is the entire Demon Sealing Valley. The reason why the Demon Sealing Valley has been able to suppress us in the Ancient Demon Land for so long is because of something behind it. However, it doesn’t matter anymore. This time, the Saint Power here has been extracted by the Heart of Saint Kingdom, allowing me to recover some of my memories. Just this alone is enough for me to plan the next step.”

The two conversed as if no one else was present.

On the other side, the three individuals looked extremely serious.

It was evident to everyone that Wu Tian was the biggest threat here. However, they forced Gu Tian to retreat without witnessing Wu Tian’s intervention. They were now utterly defenseless, like lambs to the slaughter.

“Now, it’s your turn.”

Saber Demon Pang De turned his gaze towards Qin Yu and made a slight gesture with his hand.

Suddenly, Jiang Feng disappeared from beside them. In the next moment, a saber light illuminated the spot where he stood. His body had already been heavily wounded by the saber energy. Had Pang De not held back, Jiang Feng would have perished from that strike.

Pang De struck again, enveloping Su Su in his eerie saber domain.

Moments later, Su Su fell to the ground, grievously injured.

The two couldn’t even withstand a single exchange against the Saber Demon.

“Now, it’s your turn. The Heart of Saint Kingdom, will you become my puppet, spared with your life and a shred of divine sense, or shall I end you and seize the Heart of the Saint Kingdom?” Wu Tian smirked.

“Hahaha, what a joke! If I, Qin Yu, can’t even defeat an ancient demon here, how could I have the audacity to vie for the position of Lord of the Saint Kingdom? Bring it on!”

Qin Yu roared with laughter, refusing to surrender. Surrendering to Wu Tian would render all his previous efforts futile.

“Young man, in another light, your arrival in this realm could be considered unfortunate. Some are simply unsuited for this domain. Your continued existence is already the greatest mercy I can offer,” Wu Tian remarked.

As he spoke, Pang De launched another assault. In an instant, Qin Yu felt himself transported to a completely unfamiliar realm.

This place seemed devoid of substance. Qin Yu felt no sense of direction, touch, or sound.

“Saber Domain!”

In an instant, a brilliant light appeared before him as a saber beam hurtled towards his body.

This was the manifestation of Saber Dao’s intent. Qin Yu was surrounded by saber light, unable to evade its onslaught.

Qin Yu closed his eyes and reached for his back.

Despite being unarmed, he couldn’t control his strength.

Qin Yu’s mouth curled into a cold smile as he spent a year cultivating within the Time Rubik’s Cube.

He had already become thoroughly familiar with the Sun Chasing Bow. Even if his perception was completely stripped away at this moment, he could still accurately control all his muscles.

Eight and a half percent bow! The strongest power!

The further the Sun Chasing Bow went, the more power it required, increasing geometrically. Therefore, even though Qin Yu had only pulled half the bowstring, he now needed to exert all his strength.

Oh? Was he actually unaffected by the Saber Domain?

Wu Tian’s expression revealed a hint of surprise.

Within the Saber Domain, Qin Yu’s arrow had already shot out fiercely, without pause.

Twin Stars!

With the assistance of the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze, he shot out another arrow at the limit once again.

The second arrow’s force tore through Qin Yu’s right arm, amplifying the first arrow’s impact.

Blade met arrow.

They collided fiercely, and the Saber Domain instantly shattered.

Qin Yu’s perception instantly returned, and a burst of intense pain came from his right arm. This was almost as he had expected..
