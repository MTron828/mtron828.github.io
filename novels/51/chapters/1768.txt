1769 The Immortal Spirit

Qin Yu suddenly felt a headache.

The fun place these two guys were talking about was a brothel.

“Come and play, sir!” A sweet voice came from above, and Qin Yu blushed.

Upon seeing Qin Yu’s appearance, Wen Da could not help but mock, “Don’t tell me you’re still a virgin?”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes at Wen Da and said, “All right, you guys go ahead. I’ll be going back first.”

“Oh my! You’re already here. Hurry up,” Wen Da pulled Qin Yu and said.

Qin Yu wanted to struggle, but his body was too weak to break free, so he had to follow them in.

As soon as he entered, the procuress ran over.

“Oh my, isn’t this the Wen family’s young master? You haven’t been here in a long time,” The procuress pulled on Wen Da’s arm and said coyly.

“I’ve been busy resisting North Plain and fighting with Yuan Xiu. I don’t have the time to come here,” Wen Da replied shamelessly.

Although the procuress knew he was bragging, she didn’t expose him. She just smiled and said, “The girls have missed you guys so much!”

Finishing speaking, she shouted to the top, “Girls, the two idio... young masters of the Wen family are here!”

Before she could finish, many girls had already gathered by the railing of the second floor.

They were gorgeously dressed and looked like a feast for the eyes as they winked at Wen Da and Wen Er.

“Young Master Wen, why haven’t you visited us in such a long time? We’ve all missed you so much.”

“Yeah. We all feel so lonely without your company.”

“Young Master Wen is mine today! Don’t fight with me!”

Seeing the girls’ attitude, Wen Da elbowed Qin Yu twice and said triumphantly, “See, this is my charm.”

Qin Yu felt a terrible headache. He was already feeling unwell, and it was even more unbearable at this moment.

“This sir looks a little unfamiliar. How come I’ve never seen him before?” At this time, the procuress’ eyes fell on Qin Yu.

Before Qin Yu could speak, Wen Da said triumphantly, “This is my brother. His name is Qin Yu. He is the great hero of Nanzhou!”

“Qin Yu? You’re Qin Yu?” The procuress was stunned. She had always been flirtatious, but she felt a trace of admiration at this moment.

“We have all heard of Mr. Qin’s magnificent feat that day. All of your expenses today will be on me.” The procuress slightly bowed to Qin Yu.

The girls on the second floor were even more excited. “Mr. Qin, I am willing to accompany you for free!”

“Mr. Qin, choose me!”

“Mr. Qin, we are all willing!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The group of girls all rushed down from the second floor and surrounded Qin Yu.

Wen Da and Wen Er, who were at the side, immediately looked displeased.

Looking at Qin Yu, whom people surrounded, Wen Da could not help but mumble, “Damn it, he stole the limelight from my home ground again.”

“Exactly. Don’t bring him out next time.”

Qin Yu couldn’t stand the enthusiasm of the crowd, so he had to pick a girl randomly and go upstairs.

As soon as she entered the room, the girl began to undress.

Qin Yu frowned and waved his hand. “I don’t need your service. Just sit there. I’ll leave in a while.”

The girl was stunned, then said in a low voice, “Mr. Qin, are you not satisfied with me? I... I can ask another girl.”

“It’s not your fault. It’s mine,” Qin Yu quickly waved his hand and said.

The girl subconsciously glanced at Qin Yu’s lower body and said in surprise, “Mr. Qin, you... I have a prescription passed down from my ancestors. I’ll look for it later.”

Qin Yu felt even more troubled. He waved his hand and said, “I just want to rest. Don’t overthink.”

Then, he closed his eyes.

He was feeling the pain with his consciousness.

When he focused all his attention on the pain, the pain instantly became more intense.

It made his face instantly sweat, and his whole body couldn’t help but tremble slightly.

The girl didn’t know what was going on. She quickly got some hot water and gently wiped the cold sweat from his forehead.

Qin Yu endured the pain and tried to mobilize the internal qi in his body, but his internal qi was extremely chaotic. The spiritual power in his body was running around like a headless fly.

The two kinds of pain suddenly burst out. His vision went black, and he fell on the bed.

“Mr. Qin, you... Are you all right?” The girl hurried over to help him.

Qin Yu frowned, shook his head, and said, “I’m fine.”

At this moment, he was extremely angry. He was mad at his current state, as if he had a disability.

“Huu.” He let out a deep breath, but the gloominess on his face was not reduced at all.

“Mr. Qin, you... Do you have something on your mind? You can tell me if you don’t mind,” the girl asked carefully.

Qin Yu glanced at her and forced a smile. “I’m fine.”

“Mr. Qin, do you despise me...” the girl said sadly.

Qin Yu saw that she was tough to deal with, so he told her about his body’s condition.

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, the girl couldn’t help but frown.

“Damaged primordial spirit?” the girl said in a low voice. She sat there for a long time without speaking. After a while, she stood up and said, “Mr. Qin, please wait for a moment. I will be back soon.”

After saying this, the girl turned around and ran out.

Qin Yu didn’t think too much about it. He closed his eyes and tried to feel the pain again.

In the blink of an eye, more than two hours had passed.

He calculated the time and felt it was about time, so he got up to leave.

When he walked out of the room, Wen Da and Wen Er were already waiting for him downstairs.

Seeing Qin Yu, the two men smiled and said, “Oh, I didn’t expect you to have such a long duration. No wonder those girls like you.”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes at them and said, “Don’t talk nonsense. Let’s go. I don’t want to stay in this place for another minute.”

They turned around and walked out of the brothel, planning to return to Dayue Mountain.

However, they had not walked for long when they heard a girl’s voice.

“Mr. Qin, please wait a moment!”

Qin Yu turned around and found it was the girl from the brothel.

There was another girl beside her.

“Oh, you’ve chased all the way here. Tsk, tsk. It seems you’re not satisfied yet,” Wen Da rubbed his chin and mumbled.

“Amazing, amazing!” Wen Er also added seriously.

Qin Yu didn’t have the time to pay attention to them. He turned to the girl and said, “Young lady, is there anything else?”
