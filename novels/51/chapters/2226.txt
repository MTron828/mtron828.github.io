2227 The Ring of Sumeru

“By the way, how is the little ginseng now?”

“In one strike, the evil exterminator severed its head, annihilating its spiritual essence. I never expected someone to comprehend such complete the Way of the Sword in this deficient continent. If he were to grow up in the Holy Region, I wonder what heights he could reach.”

The man with the mustache shook his head and made an eye gesture to Qin Yu.

“You’ve done your very best. Without the help from both of you, I’m afraid Xiaoru and I would have died there.”

Elder Guai sighed and said.

“Is the gap really that great?”

Qin Yu clenched his fists somewhat unwillingly. He was born on Earth and never dared to slack off on his cultivation path for Yan Ruoxue. However, there was always a high mountain in front of him, making him constantly look up.

“There is always a mountain higher than the other. When you are at the top of the mountain, you will only focus on the mountain that is higher than you. And the myriad mountains beneath your feet have long been overlooked by you.”

Elder Guai shook his head and said.

“Although the evil exterminator is also a genius, he has cultivated for nearly 3,000 years. Your cultivation of several hundred years enabled you to withstand this sword strike, which is already enough to be proud of.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

It was rare for the man with the mustache not to tease Qin Yu. He seemed to know the origins of the evil exterminator very well.

“The evil exterminator’s parents were killed by demons. He thus cultivated only to kill demons and eliminate evil. This kind of person has no distracting thoughts, and his cultivation speed can only be said to be terrifying. If my young friend Qin Yu has only cultivated for a few hundred years, your talent is definitely not inferior to him. You might be able to stand shoulder to shoulder with your father one day!”

Elder Guai nodded.

“Did your soul-sucking formation collect the soul of the ginseng?”

Qin Yu suddenly recalled the eye gesture the man with the mustache did to him just now and grabbed him.

“By luck, by luck!”

The man with the mustache cupped his fists and looked humble.

“Brother, can you save little brother ginseng?”

Xiaoru came over and asked pitifully.

“It’s just a wisp of soul. Its body has been destroyed. If there’s a wisp of its body, it could still be like Elder Guai.”

The man with the mustache shook his head like a rattle drum.

“I have it here. Save him.”

Qin Yu took out the severed body part he had obtained.

“Are you stupid? To be blunt, heaven and earth will destroy us on our path of cultivation. The spiritual power of this severed body part is enough to allow you to advance several stages, and you can extract the way of this remnant soul using a secret technique. It is the way of life and death! I wouldn’t trade it even if you give me an Emperor Weapon.”

The man with the mustache kept chattering incessantly.

“Do me a favor, and I’ll give you some information on ancient formations.”

Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

He did not know why he wanted to save that little ginseng. Perhaps it was because of Xiaoru and Elder Guai.

In purgatory, he did not encounter any friends. Chang Hu’s team suddenly launched a sneak attack.

With the incredibly jealous Zong Yue’s attack, he was on tenterhooks almost every day.

Only Xiaoru gave him a petal the first time she saw him.

Elder Guai had also given him the locust tree shield because of his father’s thousand-year-old kindness. Before the battle, he had given his hardest shield to Qin Yu.

“Not enough!”

The man with the mustache shook his head like a rattle drum.

“Nine trigrams of destiny! I’ll introduce you to a formation master. He had comprehended the nine trigrams of destiny and saved my life using it.”

Qin Yu suddenly thought of Wang Feng, the formation genius.

“Nine trigrams of destiny? Are you telling the truth?”

The man with the mustache’s eyes widened. This was close to the Way of Formation!

There were countless ways in the world, but all would lead to the same destination.

Pill had its alchemy way, sword technique had its sword way, and formation had its formation way.

“Alright! I agree!”

The man with the mustache readily agreed without hesitation.

He took the severed part of ginseng from Qin Yu and took out a small bottle.

After removing the seal, a wisp of divine sense entered the ginseng.

Soon, the ginseng turned into a baby boy.

However, his face was tremendously pale, and his skin was somewhat dry.

“This wisp of the spiritual soul is too weak. If it’s a little bit stronger, even the vital energy of heaven and earth would be drawn toward this kind of genius treasure that has comprehended the way. At the present moment, his life force is constantly draining. I estimate that he can live for several decades at most.”

The man with the mustache shook his head. He really could not understand Qin Yu’s actions.

He could only guess that Qin Yu owed Elder Guai and Xiaoru a big favor. Otherwise, he would not have done this.

Qin Yu suddenly thought of the Soul Torment Mind Technique.

This netherworld’s cultivation method was indeed targeted at the spiritual soul, and it was greatly effective on the damage of the spiritual soul.

Immediately, his soul power rushed into the little ginseng’s sea of consciousness.

A chubby baby stared at him curiously.

“Do not resist, little chubby one. Follow the guidance of my heart technique.”

Qin Yu led the little ginseng to circulate the Soul Torment Mind Techniquet. He was also unsure and did not know if this idea will work.

One round, two rounds…

After an unknown duration, the baby boy’s divine sense suddenly emitted a suction force.

And as time passed, the suction force became increasingly violent.

With a thought, Qin Yu returned to his sea of consciousness.

After that, he released a few demon beasts’ souls from his spatial ring. Before the demon beasts’ souls could react, they were already swallowed by the little ginseng.

“It worked!”

Qin Yu was overjoyed to see the suction force of the little ginseng’s consciousness not decreasing at all. He released 80% of the demon beasts’ souls he had imprisoned, and in a short while, all of these souls were sucked by the little ginseng.

“Yes!”

The man with the mustache suddenly let out a cry of shock.

“Qin Yu, what did you do? This little ginseng’s soul seemed to have strengthened?”

“There’s a soul-repairing cultivation method I’ve just tried out, and it seems useful!”

Qin Yu could not help but be overjoyed seeing the Soul Torment Mind Technique work on the little ginseng.

“F*ck, in that case, I’ve made a huge gain. As long as the divine sense recovers a little, and there’s sufficient vital energy, its body will naturally nourish again. Then, won’t I have an endless supply of ginseng?”

The man with the mustache was ecstatic.

“No!”

The daffodil girl glared fiercely at the man with the mustache and stood beside the soundly sleeping baby boy.

“Qin Yu, we’ve initially wanted to find a place to live in seclusion, but if you can save little ginseng now, can we follow you?”

Elder Guai said after a moment of hesitation.

Qin Yu nodded. He had acted to save the little ginseng. Now that he had found a way, he would continue until the end.

“Are you courting death? This old man is not much of use, but this little girl and little fatty are supreme treasures. If you take them with you, I reckon that the moment you leave purgatory, the streets will be filled with demon beast cultivators stopping you.”

The man with the mustache said unhappily.

“It’s fine. Qin Yu, this is for you. It’s the ring of Sumeru.”

Elder Guai handed Qin Yu a ring carved with an ancient dragon. As soon as he touched it, it emanated a strong and weighty sensation.

With a thought, Qin Yu entered the space of Sumeru.
