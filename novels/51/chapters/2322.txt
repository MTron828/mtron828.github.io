2323 Hua Tian’s Goodwill

“Did you guys encounter the ghost race?”

“My divine sense detected a ghostly qi fluctuation on the fifth level just now. Furthermore, Wang Feng had used my talisman, so I have a rough judgment.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Brother Qin Yu, although the ghost race isn’t strong, their methods are tremendously mysterious. Under various secret techniques, both of us were almost killed. I’m afraid we couldn’t last until Lord Jue Wu arrived if you did not leave us with life-saving methods.”

Wang Feng’s face was ashen. He had yet to recover his senses from the battle just now.

“The alien race’s invasion is happening frequently now. The 100,000 residents of the Azure Ridge Continent have been slaughtered until only a few thousand are left. You guys don’t leave for now.”

Qin Yu instructed.

There seemed to be a temporary restriction in space. The ones that appeared recently were all weak alien races.

In the meantime, he did not sense any powerful alien races appearing in space.

“They’re all trash. I crushed them with one punch. Come over and eat the ghost meat.”

Jue Wu took out two corpses from her spatial ring.”

Qin Yu took a glance. The appearance and aura of these two ghosts were close to the middle of the demon race and human race. They looked a little like humans and demons.

“Sister, I don’t want to eat.”

Yun Qingyun’s face was ashen as she waved her hands repeatedly.

“Although the meat of this ghost race isn’t that delicious, it’s very unique and has a different style. In any case, it’s something that I’ve never tried before. Hurry up, go and prepare the meat, and we can roast it!”

Jue Wu waved her fist and glared at Qin Yu.

“Okay, okay, okay.”

Qin Yu recalled his days in Nanzhou. It was the same back then.

Jue Wu sat on his shoulder and shouted at him. Wen Da and Wen Er were also running around.

Qin Yu’s divine sense moved, and he suddenly sensed a ball of death qi in Jue Wu’s soul.

His heart sank. He had never noticed this death qi before.

Moreover, Jue Wu should still have some time left based on the thousand-year life span of the Nirvana Body. Could this change a sign that Jue Wu’s lifespan was about to end?

“Elder Guai, can the curse of the Nirvana Body be removed?”

Qin Yu secretly voice-transmitted to Elder Guai, not wanting Jue Wu to hear him.

“It’s very difficult. There were four or five people with Nirvana Bodies in purgatory previously, and as far as I know, none of them escaped the thousand-year curse. It’s something destined by the Path of Heaven and difficult to change.”

The Nirvana Body allowed one to improve continuously without any cultivation, but the Path of Heaven had set a limit to strength and life.

It was like the Five Declines of Celestial Beings.

No matter how powerful a cultivator was, he started to age and lose all his cultivation as he reached a certain age.

Even Imperial Emperors were no exception.

Qin Yu’s mind was in a mess as he prepared the ghost meat and let Jue Wu start roasting it.

“Qin Yu, it’s fine. Sister Jue Wu is very happy to know you. It’s alright as I have you to accompany me before I die.”

Jue Wu handed over a roasted leg.

“Nonsense. I’ll spank you if you dare to say it again.”

“Are you rebelling? I’m a few hundred years older than you, and you want to spank my buttock.”

…

After a round of noise, it finally quieted down.

The group of people drank wine and fell into a deep sleep.

“Hmm? Something’s not right!”

Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes. He thought of somebody!

Situ Haoyue, the cultivator who had survived two Path of Heaven years. He was only at the Peak of the True Saint and thus could not live for so long. Moreover, he was a human cultivator and would not have various heaven-defying methods.

He must have a way to increase his life force!

Qin Yu’s heart began to beat rapidly. Although this was only his guess, it was a way.

“Ji Yue, quickly help me find out where Situ Haoyue is now.”

Qin Yu immediately took out a voice transmission jade talisman and crushed it.

“Hurry up and help me find him. I’ll agree to any price.”

“Alright, you have to keep your word then.” Hearing Qin Yu’s words, Ji Yue knew this matter should be very important.

Immediately, she mobilized some people to inquire about Situ Haoyue’s whereabouts.

She was very efficient. In less than half a day, Qin Yu received her voice transmission.

“After Situ Haoyue fought with you and escaped from the eighth level, some cultivators saw him appear in the sixth level of purgatory. From that day onward, he has never appeared again. He must have been cultivating secretly in a Mystic Realm.”

“Alright, I owe you a favor.”

Immediately, his Sumeru qi swept up Jue Wu and the others, and they set off straight away.

“Qin Yu, can you bring me along?”

Mei Li hesitated for a moment and frowned.

Now, the eighth level of purgatory had no other advantage besides the abundant spiritual energy in the space.

Therefore, it was useless for her to stay here for long.

“Alright.”

Qin Yu hesitated for a while before bringing her along.

Soon, he appeared on the sixth level of purgatory.

His vast divine sense, imbued with the power of the soul from the divine sense spirit bead, swept out.

This power was sufficient to see through various illusory Mystic Realms. Even the caves in the mountains were clearly presented before Qin Yu.

This was the terror of a half-step heavenly might. His divine sense was like the Heavenly Eye.

Qin Yu carefully swept through all the Mystic Realms. He seemed to have sensed Situ Haoyue’s internal qi in one place.

Qin Yu’s body moved and arrived at that place. Then he directly punched out.

He directly broke the entrance of the Mystic Realm and stepped in.

Was he dead?

At this moment, no one was in the Mystic Realm, but Qin Yu’s soul could smell the remnants of the soul.

That was Situ Haoyue’s soul that had scattered.

“Situ Haoyue has lived for two Path of Heaven years and has countless techniques. Even if he is injured, his soul will not scatter. Could it be that there are still cultivators hidden in purgatory?”

Qin Yu frowned.

His expression changed slightly as he circulated the Traceless Immortal Scripture.

Countless strands of chaotic qi shot into the void and transformed into a giant compass.

He immediately deduced using the Five Elements and Eight Trigrams Technique.

The Traceless Immortal Scripture contained many cultivation techniques. Qin Yu had only comprehended the method of absorbing spiritual energy previously.

At this moment, deducing what would happen based on the remaining information was also an extraordinary ability.

Wu Ji became the strongest cultivator in the Degenerate Age. Five Elements and Eight Trigrams Technique also played an important role in it.

This was also another method that Qin Yu had comprehended after condensing the divine sense spirit bead.

Countless images formed in Qin Yu’s mind, and he slowly modified them and recalled them.

The ultimate truth slowly took shape.

“Hua Tian!”

Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes.

This guy seemed to have not used his true strength last time. Otherwise, he would not have been able to kill Situ Haoyue with the strength he had exposed. Moreover, he killed Situ Haoyue in one blow.

However, this person’s cultivation method was indeed a little mysterious. He had waited in this Mystic Realm to plot against Situ Haoyue.
