Then, Qin Yu returned to reality again.

The floating talisman instantly lost control and began to tremble wildly during Qin Yu’s transfer.

Qin Yu hurriedly tried his best to stabilize the talisman and began to draw the last holy image.

“What?”

Two surprised voices sounded at the same time.

The Buddha, who had thought that Qin Yu would die, launched a furious attack again. In an instant, the divine soul urged by the Yin soldiers attacked Qin Yu crazily.

“Oh no!”

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically.

The talisman was about to collapse, but he couldn’t resist the power if he didn’t enter the dream realm.

“I’m going all out!”

The black lightning had already descended in an instant. Qin Yu did not hesitate anymore.

The Night Qi on his body was released once again, but the Three Light Talisman disappeared along with it!

“It was indeed the Dao of Dreams! I did not expect a big fish to come in!” The Buddha in the air let out a soft chant.

His body blurred, and he left the short-haired youth behind before disappearing.

“Interesting! Such an interesting soul, I wonder how delicious it would be if I could eat it!”

The short-haired young man touched the corner of his mouth and stared at the place where Qin Yu disappeared with a strange sharp smile.

The Night Qi brought Qin Yu’s body into a pitch-black space.

At the same time, the talisman also entered this dark space.

Qin Yu’s face was a little pale.

The consumption of this power of dram had increased dozens of times as he shuttled into this space with this Three Light Talisman. At this moment, he already felt extremely weak.

Drawing the Three Light Talisman consumed a lot of soul power. Moreover, he was drawing in the dream space.

This consumption was even greater. More than half of the Night Qi in his body had been consumed.

The world spun in front of him and the scenery around him changed again.

He returned to the Nineteenth Prison. The Buddha in the air seemed to be waiting for him.

The moment Qin Yu appeared, a destructive power had already surrounded the entire space.

Boom!

Qin Yu made a hand gesture and was about to activate the talisman.

Suddenly, a palpitation spread throughout his entire body. The power of the Night Qi suddenly surged.

“Oh no! After my divine soul was exhausted, I didn’t seem to have urged the Night Qi to return to the Nineteenth Prison.”

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. This was still a dream.

He suddenly stopped the hand seals and allowed the power to penetrate his body.

Boom!

Amidst the explosion, the Night Qi in Qin Yu’s body surged again and returned to the Nineteenth Prison!

He formed a seal with his hand. The Three Light Talisman turned into a bright energy fluctuation that surged into the sky.

An enormous power suddenly squeezed into the sky above the Nineteenth Prison. A deep lecture voice spoke of the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom’s power of order.

The stars in the sky lit up the entire sky.

All the space turned into nothingness, and the entire Nineteenth Prison shook violently as if some kind of foundation had been destroyed.

“Why am I here? Where am I?”

“Ain’t I in the Endless Mine? Why am I here?”

The three holy statues slowly took shape and many people began to understand.

They had completely woken up from their dreams.

These divine souls suddenly turned into countless square fragments and then dissipated in the Nineteenth Prison.

“It’s finally done!”

Qin Yu took a deep breath.

However, he suddenly sensed something and turned around.

At this moment, the short-haired young man was staring at him like a poisonous snake. He made a beheading gesture.

“Be careful when you enter this space. We might meet again. Hahahaha!” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and the Night Qi on his body surged.

This person was very powerful. To be able to fight with the Buddha without falling into a disadvantage, this kind of strength could already be considered heaven -defying.

In the next moment, his body had already appeared on the spot and returned to the Endless Mine.

However, a black figure suddenly appeared in the space at the moment of shuttling.

His face could not be seen, but it seemed to be the Buddha who had

disappeared.

Countless babies were screaming on his body. He stepped through the dream realm and approached Qin Yu’s true body divine soul.

With every step he took, intense energy fluctuated around him.

He opened up a passageway. This passageway was close to the one Qin Yu had created.

“Oh no!”

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. He already understood the Buddha’s plan.

At this moment, he should be planning to forcefully enter his dream world and kill him.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and pushed the Night Qi to the extreme. At this moment, he could not care less about saving this power.

He entered another dream.

However, he did not shake the black shadow off. The shadow kept its distance.

Even though Qin Yu was constantly consuming the Night Qi to shuttle to different dream spaces, he could still discover Qin Yu’s divine soul.

As time passed, Qin Yu used up his Night Qi to travel.

The black shadow was only a stone’s throw away from him. Qin Yu could even feel the freezing and evil intent emitted from the Buddha.

“You destroyed my Nineteen PrisonFormation. Today, I will use your divine soul to pay for it. I will follow you and turn your divine soul into a Nightmare even if you’re back to the reality.”

The Buddha’s voice was very calm when it rang in Qin Yu’s ears.

A cold hand had unknowingly touched Qin Yu’s shoulder.

A baby with a ferocious smile appeared in front of Qin Yu and then countless evil babies climbed up his body. They started to bite Qin Yu’s body.

“I’ll go all out!”

Qin Yu was anxious. He activated the remaining Night Qi and his divine soul directly shuttled back to the Endless Mine.

His body bounced up abruptly and his face turned pale.

Even though it was the reality, he could still see the black shadow and the evil infants on his body.

Indeed, it was as Buddha said. Even if he returned to reality, he would always follow Qin Yu.

“Eh, where did the energy come from? It looks pretty good. I’ll gladly accept it.”

A familiar voice came from Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness. The dagger let out a surprised sound. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Who are you? How can you absorb my power?”

The black shadow in his sea of consciousness let out an angry roar. A world-destroying power was emitted from his body.

It blasted toward the dagger in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness, but it did not leave a single drop behind before sinking into the dagger’s body.

In the next second, the evil infants in Qin Yu’s divine sense also let out terrified cries.

The dagger emitted a huge suction force, pulling them into its body..
