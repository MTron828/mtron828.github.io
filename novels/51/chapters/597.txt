Chapter 598: One Hundred Thousand Inner Cores! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The so-called inner cores of demonic beasts were just a guise. The real treasure lay beneath the huge island.

This was the information from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. There was absolutely no mistake.

Looking at the surface of the sea, Yan Guiyi felt more and more uneasy.

He would never feel at ease unless he saw Qin Yu’s body with his own eyes.

...

In the sea.

Qin Yu’s fresh blood dyed the surrounding sea red.

He opened his eyes with difficulty. The Venerable Fifth Mountain was still hanging on his chest.

“You saved my life again...” Qin Yu stroked the Venerable Fifth Mountain and said in a low voice.

He tried to move his body, and waves of pain came from every part of his body.

Under the invasion of the sea water, his wounds were in unbearable pain.

He stared at his surroundings, which were pitch black.

Then, Qin Yu cast a water repellent spell, igniting a spiritual fire under the sea.

Qin Yu tried to stabilize his body in the water to prevent himself from falling continuously.

He raised his head to look at the sky, but it was pitch black above him.

This meant that Qin Yu had already fallen very deep into the sea.

If not for the strength of his body, he would have been crushed into meat paste by the water pressure long ago.

“With my current state, if I encounter a demonic beast... I will definitely die.” Qin Yu frowned.

He took out the pill furnace that the Pavilion Master had given him and the herbs that had been stored for a long time.

“I can only use the pill to recover my physical body.” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Qin Yu put the herbs into the pill furnace with great difficulty. Then, he ignited the spiritual fire and began to refine the pill.

The pill that Qin Yu refined was called the Blood Clotting Pill. It was an extremely simple pill that could be refined with ordinary herbs.

“Sigh, using these herbs to refine the Blood Clotting Pill... What a waste.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little pained.

But at the moment, he couldn’t care less. The key was to recover his physical body as soon as possible.

...

Late at night, He Teng rose from the surface of the sea.

He walked to Yan Guiyi and shook his head. “I didn’t find him. He must have fallen to the bottom of the sea.”

Yan Guiyi glanced at He Teng and said coldly, “Keep looking.”

“Captain Yan, please believe me. That strike is definitely enough to take Qin Yu’s life,” He Teng said in a low voice.

Yan Guiyi said coldly, “This boy often escapes from death. I won’t feel at ease until I see his body.”

Although He Teng was reluctant, he could only follow Yan Guiyi’s request and dive into the sea again.

After an unknown amount of time, Qin Yu finally refined eight Blood Clotting Pills.

He didn’t waste any time and immediately swallowed the Blood Clotting Pills.

The moment the pill entered his stomach, Qin Yu’s body slowly recovered at a speed visible to the naked eye.

After a full three hours, Qin Yu’s internal qi had finally recovered more than half.

“If I don’t die from this disaster, I will definitely be lucky in the future.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

He raised his head to look at the sky, but he wasn’t in a hurry to leave.

“If I can’t take off this bracelet, I will die if I go up,” Qin Yu said with a frown.

He tried to use brute force to take off the bracelet, but he found that he couldn’t do it at all.

The bracelet seemed to be stuck to his skin, and he couldn’t take it off at all.

“Do I have to wear this bracelet forever?” Qin Yu frowned tightly.

But soon, Qin Yu came a realization.

“That’s not right. This bracelet must have a time limit. Otherwise, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association could control everyone with this bracelet!” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Just as Qin Yu thought, this bracelet did have a time limit.

If it was permanent, this bracelet would be considered a divine artifact.

“I can only wait for now,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“The moment this bracelet loses its effect will be the moment He Teng dies.”

Although Qin Yu didn’t know if his guess was right, he could only wait for now.

He had the water avoidance spell, so there wasn’t too much risk in staying under the sea.

Qin Yu released his internal qi and it covered a large area of the sea. He captured one internal qi after another.

Soon, Qin Yu felt the internal qi of several Martial Marquises.

“These internal qi should come from the island,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

There weren’t many Martial Marquises, not to mention that this place was extremely remote. There was only one possibility, and that was Yan Guiyi and the others.

Qin Yu followed the internal qi and swam over. About an hour later, Qin Yu saw a huge island in front of him.

This island was extremely huge. What was even more shocking was that this island was actually suspended in the sea.

“Strange.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but be a little surprised.

“A rootless island? Then how is this island fixed in the same position?”

One had to know that there were a lot of storms on the sea. Since it was rootless, it would naturally change its position continuously.

“Looks like this island isn’t as simple as it seems.” Qin Yu touched his chin. Then, he activated his spirit energy and approached the island.

As he saw that he was getting closer and closer to the island, the area in front of Qin Yu began to light up.

In front of him, it seemed as if countless lights were lit up. Although the light was quite dim, it appeared extremely strange on this island.

“Huh? What are those lights?” When he got closer to the island, Qin Yu suddenly realized that there were dim lights under the island!

If he looked carefully, there were pearls condensing under the island!

At a glance, there were countless pearls!

“Are these... Night-luminescent Pearls?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but be puzzled.

He hurried to the bottom of the island and carefully observed it. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The pearls weren’t big, and were only the size of a glass ball. All the pearls were attached to the island.

Qin Yu reached out and pulled out a pearl.

In an instant, a wave of spiritual energy spread out.

Qin Yu was stunned, and then a trace of excitement flashed in his eyes.

“Could it be... This is an inner core?!” Qin Yu exclaimed!

Qin Yu didn’t dare to think too much about it and hurriedly swallowed the inner core.

As expected, a surge of spiritual energy exploded in Qin Yu’s dantian!

“This... This is really an inner core!” Qin Yu shouted out in excitement!

This island was huge, and inner cores covered the entire bottom of the island!

At a glance, there were countless inner cores. There were at least tens of thousands of them!

“I’m... rich!” Qin Yu was overjoyed!

Such a huge number of inner cores was simply unimaginable!
