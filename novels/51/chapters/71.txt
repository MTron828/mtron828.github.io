Mr. Zhang lit a cigarette and looked at Li Yan unhappily.

“Li Yan, I only gave your cousin this opportunity because of your friend,” Mr. Zhang said derisively.

“Yes, yes, yes, Mr. Zhang, I understand.” Li Yan quickly nodded and bowed.

Mr. Zhang continued, “But your cousin is too disrespectful, isn’t she? Why is treating her to a meal so hard?”

Hearing Mr. Zhang’s words, Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse inside.

Li Yan smiled embarrassedly and said, “Mr. Zhang, my cousin is a chaste girl. If you really want to have some fun, I’ll make arrangements tonight. I guarantee that you will be satisfied...”

“F * ck you!” Hearing this, Mr. Zhang threw the cigarette butt in his hand at Li Yan.

“Li Yan, what the f * ck are you talking about? Do I lack that money or something?” Mr. Zhang said with a cold expression.

Li Yan stood there looking extremely embarrassed. Although he was angry, he didn’t dare to lose his temper.

“Li Yan, let me tell you the truth. I just want to fool around with your cousin! And I’m definitely going to do it!” Mr. Zhang said with a sneer.

Song Wei’s expression turned extremely ugly. She looked at Li Yan with some worry.

Qin Yu glanced at Li Yan, as if he wanted to see his attitude.

Li Yan stood there without saying anything for a long time. He gritted his teeth and said, “Mr. Zhang, we’ll just give up this job!”

After saying that, Li Yan walked to Song Wei’s side and said, “Let’s go!”

“Stop!” Mr. Zhang sneered.

“I said, this woman is mine for sure! If you leave now, not only will you lose your job, but you’ll also cross me!” Mr. Zhang said aggressively.

When he heard this, Li Yan’s expression turned even uglier.

As the manager of Chuzhou Bank, Mr. Zhang knew many well-connected businessmen.

If he wanted to ruin a person, it would be a piece of cake!

“It’s not too late to repent now,” Mr. Zhang said nonchalantly.

Li Yan gritted his teeth, took a deep breath, and said, “Mr. Zhang, just come at me. It has nothing to do with my cousin.”

Qin Yu felt a little heartened inside.

It seemed that Li Yan wasn’t a bad person. At least he wasn’t a person who sold out his family for his own benefits.

“Let’s go,” Song Wei whispered to Qin Yu.

However, Qin Yu shook his head. He pulled Song Wei back and said with a smile, “Do you really want this job?”

Song Wei said with a bitter smile, “Of course. I studied hard for so many years and finally graduated with a master’s degree. I didn’t expect to be humiliated like this when looking for a job...”

Qin Yu also sighed inside.

It was because of people like Mr. Zhang that the lives of young people became more and more difficult.

Qin Yu reached out and patted Song Wei’s shoulder while saying, “Don’t worry. I’ll let you get what you want and work at Chuzhou Bank.”

“Enough, stop bluffing.” Li Yan couldn’t help but snort.

“You’re from out of town. How do you have the ability to do that?”

Qin Yu didn’t explain. He turned around and walked towards Mr. Zhang, then sat down on Mr. Zhang’s desk.

Mr. Zhang froze, then he said angrily, “Are you courting death?! Get out of here quickly!”

Qin Yu stared at Mr. Zhang and said indifferently, “Apologize to my friend now, and then obediently complete the entry procedures for her. Then I can let it slide.”

Hearing Qin Yu’s words, Mr. Zhang couldn’t help laughing and said, “Where did this fool come from? Let it slide? Who do you think you are?”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “This is my final warning to you.”

“Warning my *ss!” Without further ado, Mr. Zhang threw a punch at Qin Yu!

Qin Yu raised his hand and grabbed Mr. Zhang’s fist! Then, Mr. Zhang was unable to move!

“You... let go of me, or I won’t forgive you!” Mr. Zhang said in a panic.

Song Wei and Li Yan also rushed forward.

“Qin Yu, let go of him for me. Forget it and let’s go, okay?” Song Wei said in a panic.

Li Yan also smiled and said, “Mr. Zhang, my friend just came to Chuzhou and doesn’t know how to behave. You... Don’t take offense...”

Upon hearing that Qin Yu had just come to Chuzhou, Mr. Zhang became even more emboldened.

He cursed loudly, “How dare you cross me? I’m telling you, I’ll never forgive you!”

“From today onwards, you can forget about staying in Chuzhou!” Mr. Zhang said with a grimace.

Song Wei and Li Yan were instantly filled with despair.

Li Yan said angrily, “If you want to dig your own grave, then do it yourself. Why drag us into this?!”

Qin Yu slowly let go of Mr. Zhang, then took out his phone to call Wei Jiang.

But Mr. Zhang thought Qin Yu was afraid.

He immediately pointed at Qin Yu’s nose and scolded, “Now you know that you should be afraid? Let me tell you, it’s too late! Even if you kneel down and beg me, I won’t spare you!”

Qin Yu ignored him. He took out his phone and was about to call Wei Jiang when Wei Jiang called first.

After the call was connected, Wei Jiang said over the phone, “Mr. Qin, I’m already at the office. When are you coming over?”

Qin Yu said in a sullen voice, “Mr. Wei, I’m in your manager’s office right now. He molested a subordinate and threatened to kick me out of Chuzhou.”

Wei Jiang froze and hurriedly asked, “Mr. Qin, which manager’s office are you in?”

“Mr. Zhang,” said Qin Yu.

“Okay, please wait a moment. I’ll be right there!” said Wei Jiang hurriedly.
