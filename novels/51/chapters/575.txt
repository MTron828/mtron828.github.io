Chapter 576: If You Want to Kill Me, Here I Am! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Although they were both Martial Marquises, there was a huge gap between a sixth-level Martial Marquis and a first-level Martial Marquis.

A sixth-level Martial Marquis was also known as the intermediate stage of the Martial Marquis Realm. There was a world of difference between a sixth-level Martial Marquis and a newly advanced Martial Marquis.

The Jingdu Martial Arts Association rarely sent out intermediate stage Martial Marquises.

Even when Qin Yu and Han Wei fought, there were only three first-level Martial Marquises there.

Now that Yan Guiyi had arrived, it was enough to show how furious the Jingdu Martial Arts Association was.

“Reckless brat.” Yan Guiyi looked at the mess and couldn’t help but say coldly.

“How many years has it been since someone dared to come to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association and provoke us?”

As he spoke, Yan Guiyi’s body emitted traces of killing intent.

Just a trace of killing intent from him was enough to make everyone tremble in fear!

“Mr. Yan, the higher-ups are already in a meeting. It’s better to wait for them to make a decision,” the person beside him said.

Yan Guiyi sneered. He didn’t say anything and turned around to leave.

...

During the association’s higher-ups’ meeting, those few higher-ups were still hidden in the darkness. It wasn’t much different from the previous meetings.

However, the atmosphere of today’s meeting seemed to be a little strange.

Xia Hang was seriously injured, but he still sat there obediently, as if he was waiting for the higher-ups’ decision.

“We can’t let him continue to grow,” someone said coldly.

“While everything is still under control, we must eliminate him immediately.”

“The martial arts world won’t allow such a person to exist!”

Hearing the words of the higher-ups, Xia Hang finally heaved a sigh of relief.

He stood up and said, “Higher-ups, I suggest that we mobilize the top-notch combat strength of the Martial Arts Association. We can’t let Qin Yu have the slightest chance of escaping.”

The higher-ups said coldly, “Xia Hang, go and make the arrangements. As long as we find Qin Yu, we will immediately kill him!”

“Yes.” Xia Hang was a little excited.

Today, Qin Yu’s performance had already exceeded Xia Hang’s imagination.

Qin Yu had just entered the rank of Martial Marquis, but he had already displayed such astonishing prowess. No one dared to imagine what kind of disaster he would bring in the future.

Qin Yu’s heart was filled with grief and indignation, and he was in unbearable anguish.

However, reason told him that if he didn’t leave Jingdu, it was very likely that he would attract disaster for himself.

Qin Yu stood on a piece of empty land for a long time without moving.

His expression was extremely cold, and anger filled his chest.

As long as he closed his eyes, the scene of Yan Ruoxue in prison would appear in his mind.

“Yan family... Yan family!” Qin Yu was in extreme anguish.

He couldn’t understand why the Yan family would allow the Jingdu Martial Arts Association to treat Yan Ruoxue like this!

As Yan Ruoxue’s uncle, why would Yan Sihai be so ruthless?!

A strong killing intent flashed through his eyes!

This killing intent wasn’t only directed at the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, but also at the Yan family!

Qin Yu took a deep breath and tried his best to remain calm.

Breaking into the Jingdu Martial Arts Association this time gave Qin Yu a general understanding of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s power.

Even Martial Marquises could be imprisoned. The power of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association was absolutely beyond imagination!

Not only that, the magic artifact hanging in the depths of the prison could easily break through Qin Yu’s defense!

No one knew what kind of magical artifact it was.

On the other side, the major families of Jingdu all received this news at the same time.

During the Yan family’s meeting, the four brothers gathered together.

Yan Sihai smoked his cigar and said indifferently, “Qin Yu is really bold. He actually barged into the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

An awkward look flashed across Yan Yongxiu’s face.

Yan Sihai glanced at him and said, “I heard Qin Yu went for Ruoxue. Yongxiu, Qin Yu seems to care more about your daughter than you do.”

Yan Yongxiu’s expression turned cold, and a trace of anger flashed across his heart.

He took a deep breath and said, “All of this was arranged by you. I believe there won’t be any problems.”

“Hahahaha!” Yan Sihai couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“Yongxiu, you’re right. Although Ruoxue is disobedient, she is still a member of our family. She represents our family.”

“No matter how powerful the Jingdu Martial Arts Association is, they wouldn’t dare to lay a finger on our family.”

Anger had long risen in Yan Yongxiu’s heart, but he still maintained a calm expression.

“Let’s find an opportunity to bring Ruoxue out.” Yan Yongxiu hesitated for a long time before finally saying.

Yan Sihai took a puff of his cigar and said indifferently, “Don’t worry. I’ll go and ask for her. As for whether they will give in, it’s hard to say.”

Speaking up to this point, Yan Sihai glanced at everyone and said with a smile, “What do you all think of Qin Yu?”

“I suggest that we get rid of Qin Yu as soon as possible,” Yan Shanhe suggested.

“Also, I heard that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association sent out six Martial Marquises, but they were unable to stop Qin Yu. One of them was even killed.”

At this time, Yan Yongxiu suddenly stood up and said, “Now, Qin Yu has such outstanding achievements, so have you ever considered betrothing Ruoxue to him?”

“In this way, not only can the Yan family obtain an outstanding Martial Marquis, but the Yan family’s crisis will also be resolved!”

However, these words angered Yan Sihai.

He slammed the table and stood up ehilr saying coldly, “The Yan family’s crisis? Does our family have a crisis? As if Qin Yu can bring a crisis to our family?!”

Yan Yongxiu frowned and said, “That’s not what I meant.”

Yan Sihai snorted coldly and said, “Betroth Ruoxue to him? Yan Yongxiu, is your brain filled with sh*t?”

“If we betroth Yan Ruoxue to Qin Yu, wouldn’t that be telling the world that our family has yielded?”

“If we lower our head to a country bumpkin, where will our family’s prestige go?!”

His words made Yan Yongxiu speechless.

To the aristocratic families, reputation seemed to be more important than anything else.

“Qin Yu’s no threat. I’ll immediately send people to kill him.” Yan Sihai said with a cold snort.

“If a Martial Marquis can’t kill him, I’ll hire ten! If ten can’t kill him, I’ll hire a Martial Saint! The Yan family can crush him to death with our money!”

Yan Sihai indeed had such ability. After all, they had wealth that could rival that of a country, as well as powerful connections and abudant resources.

“I’ll head to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association later and find someone to kill Qin Yu!” Yan Sihai said coldly.

“At the same time, I’ll issue a bounty. As long as someone kills Qin Yu, I’ll give him ten billion! Is that enough!?”

Looking at the furious Yan Sihai, no one dared to say anything.

“No need to trouble yourself. If you want to kill me, I’m here.”

However, at this moment, a voice suddenly sounded!

They saw a young man striding in from outside the door. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

His expression was extremely cold and his entire body was filled with killing intent!
