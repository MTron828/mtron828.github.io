Chapter 1108: Chapter 1108: scheming against each other 

This mighty figure clearly did not expect Qin Yu to be so bold and greedy.

However, the effects of the strange flower were far inferior to the Heavenly Essence Pill.

If there happened to be a heavenly essence pill to replenish when it was born, that would naturally be the best.

“Alright, I’ll agree to it,”the mighty figure said coldly.

“Fifty-fifty between you and me, but let me tell you, the pill that fails will be on you.”

Qin Yu hurriedly nodded and said, “Of course, no problem! Thank you, Senior.”

“Then let’s not waste any more time. Let’s begin now,”said the Almighty.

“Senior, may I ask you a question? When will you be born?”Qin Yu asked.

The Almighty Glanced at Qin Yu and said, “Why are you asking this?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Please don’t misunderstand. I just want to make a plan in advance.”

“About half a month later,”said the mighty figure.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “Alright, I understand.”

The mighty figure did not say anything else and turned to leave.

Yun long coldly looked at Qin Yu and snorted, “Kid, consider yourself lucky.”

Qin Yu did not continue the conversation. Instead, he began to pick the strange flowers.

Yun long quickly walked towards the valley in the depths.

He came to the vicinity of the valley and knelt down as he said, “Master, why did you agree to him? That’s half of the Heaven Essence Pill!”

The almighty said indifferently, “Don’t talk about half. Even if he wants all of it, I’ll agree.”

Yun Long was stunned. He asked with some confusion, “Why?”

The almighty snorted coldly, “It’s just a drawing of a cake. In any case, he won’t be able to obtain a single pill in the end.”

“After he finishes refining the pill, he will lose his value.”

Yun Long was taken aback before he came to a sudden realization, “I understand! Master is brilliant!”

“Alright, go and keep an eye on this kid to prevent any accidents from happening,”said the mighty figure.

“Yes!”

Yun long immediately stood up and walked in Qin Yu’s direction.

At this moment, Qin Yu plucked the strange flower and began to refine the heavenly essence pill.

Yun long stared at him from the side and did not leave his side at all.

Qin Yu glanced at him and could not help but frown slightly.

For some reason, he felt that these two people were not reliable.

“After I finish refining the Heavenly Essence Pill, I’m afraid I’ll lose my value,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He glanced at Yun long beside him and frowned more and more tightly.

“This won’t do. I have to think of a way to take the strange flower and leave this place,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He did not believe the words of this mighty figure.

In the world of cultivators, it was common to kill people and steal goods. In order to increase one’s cultivation, any despicable thing was not worth mentioning. How Could Qin Yu believe him.

“This Yun long has been watching me. If I want to escape, I’m afraid it won’t be that simple,”Qin Yu thought to himself as he picked the strange flower.

“Other than the Yun long, I still have to think of a way to escape from this Yun Long Island.”

One had to know that the Yun Long Island was an isolated island deep within the sea, surrounded by the sea.

Even if he was lucky enough to escape from the Yun Long’s sight, it would definitely not be an easy task for him to return to the fire country.

“Forget it. Even if I have to escape to the bottom of the sea, I absolutely can not stay here.”The more Qin Yu thought about it, the more he felt that it was a little strange.

Why was this Yun Long staring at him?

Furthermore... that mighty figure seemed to have agreed rather straightforwardly.

Who knew how many people on this island had died at their hands? This was enough to prove that they weren’t good people. In their eyes, human lives were probably as worthless as grass.

“I need to think of a way to get rid of this Yun Long,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

“If it’s just this Yun Long, I’m not afraid. However, if that mighty figure makes a move, I’m afraid I Won’t be able to escape.”

Thinking of this, Qin Yu looked at Yun long and said, “Yun Long, May I ask why your master will be born in half a month?”

Yun long coldly glanced at Qin Yu and said, “You shouldn’t ask. It’s best if you don’t open your mouth.”

Qin Yu wasn’t angry. He smiled and said, “I just have a better plan.”

Yun long sized up Qin Yu and waited for him to continue. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Think about it. The absorption of the heavenly new year requires time. After half a month, I don’t know how many Heavenly Yuan pills I will have in my hands

“At that time, it will be almost impossible for your master to absorb them all at once

“Why don’t he come into the world now? If I refine one pill, he will absorb one. Wouldn’t that save a lot of time?”

Yun long frowned slightly and snorted, “Don’t think too much of yourself. Do you think that this seal can be removed by yourself?”

“AH? Does that mean that all the corpses on this island were killed by you? I thought it was your master who did it, but you are actually so powerful!”Qin Yu flattered him.

Yun long said proudly, “Of course. Since I am a Guardian Demon Beast, I naturally have some ability.”

“Impressive, impressive. Fortunately, your master spoke out to stop me. Otherwise, I’m afraid I would have died in your hands.”Qin Yu said with a smile.

Yun long immediately became even more proud. He put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “It’s good that you know. So you have to repay my master. Do you understand?”

“Of course. If it’s possible, I really want to take him as my master and follow him around.”Qin Yu sighed.

“I’m afraid you don’t have the qualifications. Hurry up and refine the medicine. Stop talking nonsense.”Yun long waved his hand.

“Alright!”Qin Yu agreed with a smile, but in his heart, he couldn’t help but curse the retard.

A few simple words of flattery had made yun long hand over everything.

“Demonic Beasts are demonic beasts. Their brains are still lacking.”Qin Yu thought to himself.

According to Yun Long, the seal of this mighty figure would only be lifted after half a month.

In other words, he wouldn’t be able to make a move during this half a month.

As such, Qin Yu would be able to escape with the strange flower before he was born.
