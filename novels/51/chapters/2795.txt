Chapter 2796: Is It Me

Fatty Situ sat on the ground with his hands on his head. No one knew what he was thinking.

He did everything according to his own preferences, including the Spacetime Hall that he had given to Xiao Hai.

Also, the talisman he gave Qin Yu was more of an investment.

Even giving Qin Yu the Heavenly Umbrella at the end was just a casual act before he did something crazy. He did not expect Qin Yu to actually push him away and let the power of the Investiture of Gods seal his divine soul.

At this moment, he felt a lump in his throat.

If it was Lance and the others, perhaps he could understand this kind of life-and-death rescue.

However, he could not understand Qin Yu’s actions emotionally and rationally.

“Boss Qin Yu! You’re so awesome. How can a mere Investiture of Gods do anything to you?”

Fatty Situ clenched his fists tightly.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Lance, who was behind him, sighed slightly as he listened to his muttering.

How could it be so easy for a person who had become a god to leave? Fatty Situ’s face flashed with an imperceptible determination.

“How is he? Is he emotionally stable?”

In a luxurious hall that was nearly a few hundred meters tall, an old man was squatting on a chair and reading a red ancient book.

“Master Situ, Young Lord has been in Qin Yu’s room all this while and has yet to come out. With his personality, it would be very difficult for him to come out in a short time. This person seems to be a friend of his.”

Divine Doctor Lu shook his head.

“This brat is just like me when I was young, but he has gone a little too far.

Enough is enough.”

The old man put down the ancient book in his hand.

“Keep an eye on the young lord. Don’t let him do anything stupid.”

It was as if he was talking to air.

However, there seemed to be a trace of turmoil in that space. Someone slowly left.

“Master, are you worried that he will give the Investiture of Gods to Qin Yu?

Even if he gives it to Qin Yu’s body to refine, I’m afraid it can only awaken him. A person who has become a God can’t escape even with the Investiture of Gods.

This is already a destined outcome.”

Divine Doctor Lu couldn’t help but laugh.

“With that brat’s personality, it’s really possible that he would do that. This thing has caused the family to lose the Divine Sun Vine. Moreover, I still have some methods although it’s an incomplete version. This power is enough to make the Situ family to rise a huge level. Treat that lady well. A life for a life. This can be considered as ending the karma of our Situ family.”

Situ Qianxun said to Divine Doctor Lu.

“The injuries on her body should be fine now. However, she is connected to the Heavenly Fate of the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom. I can’t do anything about the heavy injuries that Heavenly Fate suffered.”

“Well, I’ll see if I can help her get rid of this trouble. The other person seems to have an extremely strong connection with the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom, right?”

“Yes, the Divine Might Chasing Star Holy Body. This holy body belongs to the position of inheritance and is also a power derived from that Saint Kingdom. Master knows the previous host of the Divine Might Chasing Star.”

“Is it?”

The old man raised his head.

“Ye Qiubai. This person’s reputation is quite strong. During the Saint War between the humans and the monster race, this person relied on his strength to stall the monster race’s Eye of Destruction for ten days and ten nights.

Finally, the other party was exhausted and killed. ”

“He fought against a Saint with his mortal body. I have an impression of him.

He’s indeed a good seedling.”

Situ Qianxun nodded. The Situ family had been involved in the Saint Kingdom War. Ye Qiubai had left a deep impression on him.

“However, the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom’s fate has declined. Although the divine might holy body’s influence isn’t as great as the holy daughter’s fate, it will still be affected.”

Divine Doctor Lu shook his head slightly. In his opinion, it would be extremely difficult to see Ye Qiubai at his peak again.

“I remember that we have something left behind by Ye Qiubai. Give it to that kid.”

“Alright.”

After a simple conversation, the entire hall returned to silence.

“Where am I?”

Qin Yu slowly stood up.

It was as if he was in an illusion. At this moment, Qin Yu’s thoughts were extremely chaotic.

It was as if his memories were mixed like glue. All kinds of mixed memories made his head hurt like needles.

After a long time, he slowly remembered what had happened.

“I seem to have been hit by the Investiture of Gods. Then am I in the Investiture of Gods now?”

Qin Yu subconsciously placed his index finger on the Soul Suppression.

A cold and familiar feeling came over, but he was unable to enter the Soul Suppressing Passage.

Even Soul Suppression couldn’t escape this place?

Qin Yu’s face was filled with bitterness. Although he did not analyze the rumors of the Investiture of Gods in detail, he had heard of the terrifying rumors before.

Now that he was here, how could he go back?

At this moment, he had a strange feeling that he could sense another space.

He could even feel the feeling of lying on the bed. It was as if his other half was in another space.

Whoosh!

A sword light suddenly locked onto Qin Yu.

The huge force completely shattered Qin Yu’s body.

This person was the young swordsman who had fought for the Investiture of Gods at the bottom of the cliff. He did not expect his divine soul to be among them.

Moreover, his sword technique seemed to be much stronger than what he had seen at the bottom of the cliff. Qin Yu could not even find any flaws.

Qin Yu had no time to think so much. The young swordsman in front of him almost suffocated him.

Before Qin Yu could even finish her breath, a few more sword lights had already slashed at his body.

The Spiritual Energy Sword tore him into pieces without any blind spots.

Qin Yu’s eyes flickered with countless fragments of his body.

“What was going on? Why can I still continue to think after I’m cut it into pieces?”

Too many changes happened in an instant. Qin Yu couldn’t think straight for a moment.

However, his body also reacted at the same time. The power of the night completely permeated his entire body.

The green-robed swordsman in front of him struck out with his sword again indifferently.

When he slashed out, countless sharp Spiritual Energy Swords swam around Qin Yu’s body.

Countless sword flowers exploded on his body. The terrifying Spiritual Energy Sword slashed and erupted with brilliant sword light.

In the sword light that filled the sky, Qin Yu’s body seemed to be an illusory existence in the Nine Nether Cliff.

Countless ominous crows circled where the Spiritual Energy Sword was.

He grabbed the young swordsman’s neck with one hand.

The Night Qi gushed out from his hand. A person who looked like the young swordsman appeared in front of him.

His sword moves, movement techniques, and strength were the same.

Was this the nightmare of the young swordsman?

What was this?

Qin Yu’s eyes flashed with shock.

This move seemed a little familiar with the move he had created before, Hell Nightmare.

It was just that his Hell Nightmare had used the power of the night to give birth to another Qin Yu..
