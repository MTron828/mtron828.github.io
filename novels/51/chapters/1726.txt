Chapter 1727: Intimidating Xiao Sheng Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“The secret weapon?”

The people watching from afar were all a little surprised.

“What kind of technique is this? Why have I never seen Xiao Sheng use it before? I have never even heard of it,” they thought.

“Do you know why I haven’t made a move yet?” Xiao Sheng stood up and asked Yuan Xiu.

“Because you don’t have the ability to do so,” Yuan Xiu sneered.

“You’re mistaken.” Xiao Sheng shook his head.

“I’m only trying to capture and relate to dao techniques but I’ve never used any,” Xiao Sheng slowly spoke.

Yuan Xiu frowned and snorted. “What nonsense are you talking about?” I don’t even understand what you’re saying!”

“Yuan Xiu, to me, you’re just a nobody who has lived for many years and obtained a powerful inheritance through the accumulation of time,” Xiao Sheng coldly said.

Yuan Xiu’s expression changed and he shouted angrily, “You’re digging your own grave! Did you just call me a nobody? If I’m a nobody, what are you?”

“There are some things that you’ll never be able to understand. That’s why I didn’t have any scruples to tell you everything,” said Xiao Sheng quietly.

As he spoke, densely packed golden radiances suddenly appeared around Xiao Sheng!

Upon closer inspection, these radiances were like thin threads that were entwining around Yuan Xiu’s body! It was as if they were listening to Xiao Sheng’s orders, and they were extremely magical!

Countless golden threads interweaved and shone with extremely holy light!

This was dao technique, the order and rules that existed in the world!

In the next second, he saw Xiao Sheng extend a finger.

He pressed his finger down.

In an instant, a ray of golden light suddenly peeked out from the dark clouds in the sky!

The golden light was like a huge finger that pressed down on Yuan Xiu!

This was the fusion of dao technique, the manifestation of order!

Yuan Xiu’s expression changed drastically. He did not dare to be careless. With a furious roar, he executed all his techniques to meet the “finger”!

Looking at Yuan Xiu’s struggling appearance, Xiao Sheng looked as calm as ever.

“Dao techniques can not be resisted, and you can not reverse the laws,” Xiao Sheng coldly said.

The finger was already pressing down on Yuan Xiu, and the magical artifact he had conjured in his hand was shattered instantly!

Even though he tried his best to resist, it was to no avail.

“Ah!”

Yuan Xiu’s eyes were wide open and he was extremely furious. He could not understand how the situation had been reversed in an instant!

Xiao Sheng was clearly on the verge of being killed just now, so he didn’t understand why he suddenly performed such a terrifying technique.

“Xiao Sheng, this isn’t over!” Yuan Xiu roared in anger, but nothing could stop the crushing power of the finger. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Boom!”

In a split second, that heaven and earth collapsed. The earth crumbled, crushing Yuan Xiu into a mist of blood. Nothing was left behind.

The golden palm also disappeared quietly.

Looking at the empty space in front of them, the surrounding crowd couldn’t help but be stunned.

“Where is Yuan Xiu? How did he disappear?”

“Could he have escaped to North Plain?”

“That’s strange. When did he escape? Also, what did Xiao Sheng mean by those words? What is dao technique?”

Everyone was dumbfounded. Only Xiao Sheng himself knew that Yuan Xiu was already dead. At the very least, this clone of his was gone.

It was now in the distance.

Qu Zhu and Wen Wanchong were in the middle of a fierce battle. Wen Wanchong was in a rampant state, causing Sima Bei to be in a disadvantageous position.

“Da*n it, can’t believe Wen Wanchong is so intimidating too!” Sima Bei was shocked as he fought! Before today, he had never taken Wen Wanchong seriously!

Yong Ji’s condition wasn’t any better. Although he wasn’t overmatched, he couldn’t pose any threat to Qu Zhu.

At this moment, Sima Bei and Qu Zhu, who were fighting, noticed a figure at the same time!

When they saw this figure, their faces instantly darkened!

This person was none other than Xiao Sheng!

The fact that Xiao Sheng was standing here meant that Yuan Xiu had lost!

“You… you…” Sima Bei pointed at Xiao Sheng, terrified.

Xiao Sheng looked at Sima Bei coldly and said, “Do you still want to continue?”

Sima Bei’s body tensed up, and he did not dare to say a word.

He didn’t even want to meet Saint Xiao in his life, let alone fight him.

Yong Ji’s expression darkened. Yuan Xiu’s defeat meant that they had failed in this war.

“Yuan Xiu was actually defeated.” Yong Ji took a deep breath, feeling extremely indignant.

“Let’s go!” Sima Bei made a prompt decision and hurriedly shouted.

“Sh*t, you want to go now? You’re dreaming!” Wen Wanchong would never allow them the chance to do so. He just wanted to kill these two people in Nanzhou!

“Let them go,” Xiao Sheng shook his head and said.

Wen Wanchong glanced at Xiao Sheng and snorted. ” “Why should I listen to you? But for the fact that you’re injured, I would’ve punched you as well.”

After saying that, Wen Wanchong did not stay any longer. He patted his butt and left.

Qu Zhu pulled a wry face and bowed slightly to Xiao Sheng and said, “See ya.”

After that, Qu Zhu also left.

A large number of people from North Plain left Nanzhou, and the people from Nanzhou heaved a long sigh of relief.

“Xiao Sheng actually won. He actually relied on his half-step Reversion Void Stage cultivation to defeat Yuan Xiu.”

“Terrifying, that’s way too terrifying. I’m afraid that no one in this world has ever done such a magnificent feat.

“That’s not necessarily true. There have been many talented people in history who might be able to do it.”

While everyone was discussing the battle, Xiao Sheng had already left.

Many cultivators who were watching the battle secretly were filled with fear and mixed feelings.

“I just knew it. Fortunately, I didn’t make a move against him earlier.”

“It seems that Zhao Jing was the one who fought for us. Otherwise, we would probably not be able to make it out of here alive.”

“See you, everyone. I’ll just cultivate in peace from now on.”

…

It was now in North Plain.

One of Yuan Xiu’s clones looked deadly serious.

Although it was only a clone that died in this battle, it was undoubtedly a humiliation to Yuan Xiu!

As a cultivator who was in Return To Void Stage, he had actually lost to a half-step Reversion Void Stage cultivator.

More importantly, he had also obtained the inheritance of Immortal Slaying Sect!

“I really wonder where this Xiao Sheng is from…” Yuan Xiu’s eyes widened in shock and he gritted his teeth.

He Teng, who was on one side, walked over and cupped his hands, “Master, there’s no need to be so anxious. I believe that Xiao Sheng has already been seriously injured. Why don’t you take this opportunity to kill him?”

Yuan Xiu raised his head and looked at He Teng. He narrowed his eyes as if he thought that this was a good idea.

Xiao Sheng’s power had far exceeded his imagination. He didn’t want to wait any longer. He just wanted to take this terrifying opponent off the map as soon as possible.

Otherwise, if he were to reach Reversion Void Stage, the entire North Plain would probably be at stake.

Thus, Yuan Xiu stood up and coldly said, “I’m leaving for Nanzhou now.”

After saying that, Yuan Xiu’s figure flickered and disappeared from North Plain.

He Teng laughed coldly as he watched Yuan Xiu leave.

…

At that moment, Xiao Sheng had already returned to Tianyun Sect.

After this battle, he had been seriously injured, especially after using the finger technique. Although he had borrowed the power of dao technique, it had exhausted his mind and spirit, and he looked extremely feeble now.
