Chapter 876: Chapter 876, looking for a mystic realm master 

“Sky Blood Rainbow?”

Everyone felt that this name was somewhat unfamiliar.

Even Gu Xinghe couldn’t help but snicker, “The Jingdu Martial Arts Association doesn’t want trash.”

“Trash?”Hearing this, the black-robed man was instantly extremely displeased.

“Mister Gu, when you say trash, are you referring to our family head?”

Gu Xinghe glanced at him and snorted, “Influential families will all receive an invitation from our Jingdu Martial Arts Association. As for the Sky Blood Rainbow, we have never heard of it.”

The black-robed man’s expression immediately became somewhat cold.

“If our family head is trash, I’m afraid everyone here is trash,”the black-robed man said coldly.

“Kid, who are you talking about? !”His words immediately aroused the anger of the crowd.

Someone slammed the table and stood up, pointing at him and cursing, “I think you’re courting death!”

The black-robed man ignored their anger. He stared at Gu Xinghe and sneered, “Mr. GU, it’s your honor to be able to cooperate with our master!”

“Since you don’t know how to appreciate favors, then don’t blame us for being impolite. I hope you won’t regret it!”

Gu Xinghe mocked, “Are you threatening me? With just you, you dare to threaten the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?”

“The Jingdu Martial Arts Association is the boss today, but that doesn’t mean it will always be,”the black-robed man sneered.

After saying this, he turned around and left.

When he reached the door, the black-robed man stopped in his tracks.

“I’ll tell you something on behalf of our family head,”the black-robed man said faintly.

“Your actions today will definitely lead to your deaths!”

After saying this, the black-robed man turned around and left without looking back.

Gu Xinghe did not take the black-robed man seriously, nor did he care about the sky blood rainbow at all.

The power of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s chief was getting lower and lower. In order to ensure his own status, Gu Xinghe called for this meeting.

Otherwise, with the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s nature, he would not even look up to these aristocratic families.

“This year, a martial saint will be born. At that time, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association will also send out a martial saint to capture Qin Yu.”

“And among you, there will also be people who will receive our training.”

Once the great world changed, there would definitely be people who would step into the martial saint realm.

Every change could change the current situation.

Therefore, the JINGDU martial arts association had to win over the hearts of the people before that.

Otherwise, the moment when the Jingdu Martial Arts Association became the King would be gone forever.

“We are willing to work for the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”Everyone stood up and said respectfully.

Gu Xinghe waved his hand and said, “Bring the gifts up.”

Before he could finish his words, the people beside him took out a few boxes.

Inside these boxes were herbs and spiritual artifacts.

Herbs were all over five thousand years old. Although spiritual artifacts were not martial saints’artifacts, they were still considered top-notch.

“This is just a welcome gift. All the talented disciples of the aristocratic families will receive our resources,”Gu Xinghe continued.

“At the same time, we will send your disciples to the Jingdu Martial Arts Academy.”

As soon as he said this, everyone became even more excited.

The Jingdu Martial Arts Academy was the palace in their hearts!

Previously, it was almost impossible to join! Unless it was one of the top aristocratic families in Jingdu!

They never thought that their descendants would be able to join the Jingdu Martial Arts Academy today!

“Thank you, Mr. Gu!”Everyone bowed respectfully.

Gu Xinghe waved his hand and said, “Alright, the meeting is over for today. You can now go back and select the geniuses from your respective families. On the sixth day of the Lunar New Year, you will join the martial arts academy on time.”

After dispersing the crowd, a trace of ridicule could not help but flash across Gu Xinghe’s face.

He looked at long mei beside him and said, “See? As long as these people at the bottom give them some benefits, they will be grateful and work for you.”

Long Mei could not help but snicker, “Do you really think we are willing to nurture them? The purpose of doing this is to treat them as cannon fodder.”

At this point, Gu Xinghe suddenly asked, “Has there been any news recently?”

Long Mei immediately bowed and said, “According to the old master, someone will step into the martial saint realm on the day of Long Yangchen. Our second mystical realm will also send three martial saints to kill Qin Yu on the same day!”

Gu Xinghe took a deep breath and whispered, “Long Mei... It seems that I still have time.”

When he heard this, Long Mei could not help but whisper, “Young Master, you should be careful before this. Try not to provoke that Qin Yu, in case something happens...”

Gu Xinghe glanced at long mei and snorted coldly, “Do you think I’m not a match for that Qin Yu?”

“Of course I don’t!”Long Mei quickly waved his hand.

Gu Xinghe snorted and said, “Don’t worry, I know what I’m doing. I Won’t act Rashly.”

Long Mei quickly nodded and said, “Yes, Young Master.”

...

The Jingdu Martial Arts Association was secretly plotting, but at this moment, Qin Yu was completely unaware.

He had the same idea in his mind, which was to build the heaven’s gate with all his strength to fight against the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

However, the most important thing for Qin Yu Now was to increase his strength and think of a way to get rid of the spirit binding spell.

Qin Yu counted the resources in his hands carefully.

These resources, together with the ownerless secret realm, were enough for Qin Yu to step into the martial saint realm.

Third Day of the Lunar New Year.

Qin Yu arrived at Ye Qing’s residence early in the morning.

He waited for an entire day. Ye Qing only drove back in the evening.

The car slowly stopped in front of Qin Yu. Ye Qing waved his hand and gestured for Qin Yu to get in the car.

After getting in the car, ye Qing did not say a word. He drove the car and sped off in a certain direction.

On the way, Ye Qing said in a cold voice, “The Jingdu Martial Arts Association has made a move recently.”

“What move?”Qin Yu asked, puzzled.

Ye Qing said in a deep voice, “They’ve gathered most of the top aristocratic families in the world and held a meeting. This meeting is very likely to be aimed at you.”

“Gathered the aristocratic families?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

Ye Qing grunted and said, “Don’t underestimate them. These aristocratic families most likely have their own resources. If they really banded together, it would be very difficult for you to deal with them.”

“Moreover... those aristocratic families in the secret realm may also attack in the dark.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “I understand. Thank you, Officer Ye.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The car sped along and soon arrived at a mansion.

This mansion was a chinese-style building. There was a huge “Secret”written on the door.

“We’re here.”Ye Qing stopped the car at the door.

He lit up a cigarette and took a puff. Then, he pointed to the front and said, “This is the residence of that Mystic Realm Master.”

Qin Yu nodded. He suppressed the excitement in his heart and said in a low voice, “As long as he is willing to help, I will be able to enter the martial saint realm as soon as possible...”
