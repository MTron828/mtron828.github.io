Chapter 596: He Teng’s Inner Demon Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

He Teng’s eyes, which were hidden in his black robe, looked coldly at Chang Mang.

“I’ve long disliked you,” He Teng said coldly.

Chang Mang shouted, “Is that so? I’ve long disliked you too!”

Chang Mang was filled with fighting spirit. Before He Teng could say anything, he had already clenched his fist and rushed forward!

He Teng snorted coldly. He raised both of his hands, and the power surrounding his body actually transformed into two rays!

These two rays of power were pressing towards Qin Yu and Chang Mang respectively!

Chang Mang wasn’t afraid at all. He held a scarlet light in his hands and faced them head-on!

However, right at this moment, a human face suddenly appeared in front of Chang Mang!

This human face was a middle-aged woman with a kind face. Her eyes were filled with deep love.

“Mom... Mom!” Seeing the middle-aged woman, Chang Mang immediately cried out!

The black energy quickly turned into a sharp blade, and pierced into Chang Mang’s body!

Although Chang Mang had a Saintly Body, the power was extremely strange, and it pierced through his body!

“Mom... Mom...” Chang Mang couldn’t care less about the pain on his body. His face was full of tears, and he couldn’t stop crying!

“Hahahaha!” He Teng laughed loudly again.

“As expected, you people at the bottom all have weaknesses!”

Qin Yu’s expression was somewhat ugly. He knew that Chang Mang was also bewitched by this power.

He hurriedly walked in front of Chang Mang and helped him up.

“Chang Mang, that’s fake. That’s not your mother!” Qin Yu shouted loudly.

But Chang Mang didn’t listen at all. His eyes were glazed over, and he kept repeating the word “mother.”.

Qin Yu frowned. It seemed that it wouldn’t be so easy to wake Chang Mang up in a short time.

Not far away, Yan Jinyao and the others couldn’t help but raise their eyebrows.

“He specializes in attacking divine sense. This technique is comparable to the environment during heavenly tribulations,” Yan Jinyao said with slight surprise.

“Haha, these two people’s bodies are extremely tough and fierce, but this He Teng uses divine sense as a weapon! Interesting!”

Everyone was filled with astonishment at He Teng’s methods.

Qin Yu stood up and looked at He Teng coldly.

He Teng said with a nonchalant smile, “Qin Yu, it’s your turn next. As long as you fall for my technique again, who else can save you?”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He said coldly, “Do you think you’re invincible with this spell?”

He Teng narrowed his eyes and said, “Although it’s not invincible, it’s more than enough to deal with you!”

With He Teng’s explosive shout, that black energy rushed toward Qin Yu again!

This time, Qin Yu stood there without moving at all. His eyes were closed.

“What, have you given up resisting?!” He Teng roared crazily!

“Then you can go to h*ll!”

That black energy was extremely agitated and headed straight for Qin Yu’s face!

“Buzz!”

At this moment, a light suddenly flashed between Qin Yu’s brows!

Following that, golden energy drilled out from between his brows!

“Huh? This... This is divine sense?” When everyone saw this, they couldn’t help but feel shocked!

The golden light transformed into a large hand and smashed down viciously!

“Ah!”

This was the power of divine sense, and it smashed towards this black energy!

What was shocking was that this golden divine sense didn’t stop there, but instead, it charged towards He Teng!

He Teng’s expression changed slightly. He was about to try to resist, but Qin Yu’s divine sense actually transformed into a human figure!

This human figure was neither He Teng’s lover nor He Teng’s mother. Instead, it had transformed into Qin Yu’s appearance!

Qin Yu, who had transformed into a golden divine sense, was tall and had a cold expression on his face. A trace of indifference could be seen in his eyes.

His gaze made it seem as if he was looking down on an ant!

He Teng’s face instantly turned extremely pale!

The power that lingered around his body also became chaotic!

“Hahahaha!” Seeing this scene, Qin Yu couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“He Teng, so your inner demon is me. Hahahaha!”

The surrounding people couldn’t help but be a little surprised.

“This guy’s inner demon is actually Qin Yu? How embarrassing.”

“I really thought that he didn’t have any weak points, but in the end, he was traumatized by Qin Yu.”

“If he can’t even overcome his inner demon, what right does he have to laugh at others?”

Countless comments reached his ears from all directions.

He Teng’s face instantly turned extremely pale! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

He shouted angrily, “Shut up!”

He Teng glared at Qin Yu and said coldly, “As long as I kill you, I won’t have any weaknesses!”

Qin Yu sneered. “But do you have that ability? Your spell has already been broken by me, so how can you fight with me?”

“I’m not afraid of you!” He Teng roared angrily and actually took the initiative to rush towards Qin Yu!

His body was wrapped by a black light, and in the blink of an eye, he arrived in front of Qin Yu!

“Want to fight with me? You’re courting death!” Qin Yu snorted coldly, then slapped him!

“Boom!”

This slap sent He Teng flying!

If it wasn’t for the black light protecting his body, this slap would probably have shattered his body!

He Teng struggled to get up from the ground. He gritted his teeth and said, “Qin Yu, I must kill you today!”

“You don’t have a chance.” Qin Yu stepped forward. His golden body was dazzling.

The huge fist suddenly smashed towards He Teng. The black energy surrounding him seemed to be unable to withstand it!

This was sheer physical strength, but all the spells seemed to be unable to withstand the single blow.

Qin Yu gave up resisting and allowed He Teng’s punches and kicks to land on his body.

However, Qin Yu’s physical body was too strong. He Teng’s strength was insignificant.

On the contrary, every time Qin Yu’s fist landed on He Teng’s body, it almost shattered his body!

“Ah!!”

He Teng roared furiously and fought back with all his might. However, what greeted him was a golden palm!

Seeing He Teng being beaten up repeatedly, Yan Guiyi, who wasn’t far away, gradually became displeased.

“Qin Yu must die today,” Yan Guiyi said coldly.

After saying that, he silently chanted a spell and began to activate the bracelet!

“Buzz!”

The bracelet hanging on Qin Yu’s body suddenly flickered with light!

In just an instant, Qin Yu felt as if he had been struck by lightning, and all the strength in his body seemed to have been sucked out! The punch he threw out was powerless!

He Teng was stunned, and he subconsciously looked at Yan Guiyi.

Yan Guiyi only glanced at him coldly.

After exchanging glances, He Teng immediately understood.

He stood up and shouted, “Qin Yu, don’t be so arrogant. I’ll kill you right now!”

After he said that, black light burst out from He Teng’s body. He suddenly slammed his palm toward Qin Yu!

“Boom!”

Under the torture of the bracelet, Qin Yu had no strength to resist He Teng!

This slap sent Qin Yu flying!

He Teng seized the opportunity to chase after Qin Yu. A dazzling light suddenly appeared, and the overwhelming spells pressed down on Qin Yu in a suffocating manner.

“Phew!”

Under the bombardment of the spells, Qin Yu spat out a mouthful of blood.

He wanted to stand up to resist, but the strength of the bracelet made him unable to stand up!

The pain went straight to his divine sense!
