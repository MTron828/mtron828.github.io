Chapter 538: Martial Marquis?! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

It was unknown what kind of spell Han Wei had used, but his entire body was wrapped in a layer of dark light.

This light was like a layer of armor that was sticking to his body tightly. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

In an instant, Han Wei’s physical body became countless times stronger, and his strength increased by several times!

The corners of Qin Yu’s mouth couldn’t help but curl up into a sneer.

“You want to fight with my physical body? How desperate are you?” Qin Yu’s entire body was flashing with golden light, and he sneered repeatedly.

The two people’s bodies were flashing with light, and their physical bodies almost reached the max at this moment.

“Rumor has it that Qin Yu’s physical body is unparalleled in the world. Today, we can finally witness it with our own eyes,” Zhuang Teng and the others not far away said indifferently.

“I also want to see if Qin Yu’s physical body is as powerful as the legends say.”

Before they could think further, Han Wei had already approached!

His body drew an arc in the air while bringing with it a dark light as he instantly arrived in front of Qin Yu!

Qin Yu didn’t panic at all. He activated the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist, and the golden light met it head-on.

“Clang!”

A sound that sounded like steel colliding entered everyone’s ears!

Qin Yu’s blood was boiling. He was like an undefeatable War God as he punched Han Wei with powerful force!

This was purely a physical fight between the two parties. There were no gorgeous moves, only the clash of powerful bodies!

Clattering sounds rang out continuously. At a glance, one could only see two rays of light intertwining!

Everyone watched the scene in front of them and couldn’t help but sigh slightly.

“For his physical body to be so powerful in terms of toughness alone, he lives up to his reputation.”

“Qin Yu’s physical body really lives up to its reputation, Han Wei’s top spell actually didn’t cause any substantial damage.”

The young masters of the aristocratic families of Jingdu were also watching the scene closely.

As far as the eye could see, the two seemed to be neck and neck.

“Boom!”

There was another head-on collision with both fists! The terrifying fist force was like a cannonball exploding between the two of them.

Qin Yu’s golden light shone. His gaze was resolute, and his eyes shone with undefeatable might!

Han Wei was the same. He roared repeatedly, as if he was fighting with his life on the line!

In the blink of an eye, the two of them had already exchanged dozens of punches, but they still couldn’t determine the victor!

“Die!” Han Wei raised his head and roared angrily. A wave of light surged on his arm, and finally exploded on his fist!

Qin Yu said coldly, “You aren’t my match if you fight with your physical body!”

Qin Yu waved his hand, and golden light shone!

His fist turned into a palm, and a dazzling golden light streaked across the void before slamming fiercely onto Han Wei’s body!

“Phew!”

Under this palm strike, Han Wei’s physical body was instantly sent flying, and a mouthful of blood flowed out from his mouth!

Qin Yu became emboldened as he fought. His chaotic body was indeed worthy of its reputation, and almost no one on the same level could compete with him in terms of physical toughness!

“Ah!!”

Han Wei flew into a rage. He raised his head and roared furiously before clenching his fist once again!

“Boom!”

How could Qin Yu give him the chance? The Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique was activated at this moment. Before Han Wei could react, he was punched in the chest again!

“Wah!”

Han Wei opened his mouth and spat out a mouthful of blood!

“He can’t fight with him by only relying on his physical body!” Above, Xia Hang was instantly anxious!

If this continued, Han Wei would definitely be beaten to death by Qin Yu!

Yan Sihai and the others’ expressions were extremely unsightly. Yan Sihai watched this scene coldly, and his displeasure was self-evident.

Han Wei crawled up from the ground. He gritted his teeth, then shot out explosively and retreated!

“You want to run? It’s too late!” Qin Yu snorted.

Qin Yu’s feet shook, and a spell was activated. Han Wei’s movements immediately slowed down!

This was the Heavy Falling Space spell that was activated by Qin Yu! Under this spell, Han Wei had nowhere to run!

He felt as if his entire body was covered in mud, and his movements were impaired!

“Slap!”

Qin Yu slapped Han Wei’s face again!

This slap almost shattered Han Wei’s facial bones!

“Boom!”

Qin Yu activated the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist and smashed it on Han Wei’s chest!

In an instant, cracks appeared on Han Wei’s dark light!

“Is this your technique? It’s nothing impressive!” Qin Yu shouted and threw another punch!

Under this punch, the light on Han Wei’s body exploded before revealing his physical body!

“Slap!”

Qin Yu raised his large hand and swung it towards Han Wei fiercely!

Without the protection of his spell, Han Wei’s physical body wasn’t worth mentioning.

This strike ruthlessly slapped Han Wei onto the ground!

Most of his bones were damaged, and fresh blood covered his entire body, making him look extremely ghastly!

Everyone couldn’t help but gasp!

No one had expected that this battle would end like this!

“Han Wei seems to be losing.”

“He’s simply being beaten up... The aristocratic families will be completely humiliated.”

“If this goes on, Han Wei will probably be beaten to death!”

On the stage, Yan Sihai was gnashing his teeth!

He glared at Han Meng and said coldly, “Is this what you meant by ‘must win’? Is this all your son has got?!”

Han Meng’s expression was even more unsightly.

At this moment, Han Wei was being trampled on like a dead dog. Han Meng saw this and felt his heart ache.

“Aren’t you all that arrogant? Don’t you call me a lowly ant?!” Qin Yu said coldly as he swung his golden palm.

“Is this the might of your aristocratic family?! Today, I will destroy your so-called arrogance!”

After each sentence, a punch would land on Han Wei’s body!

Han Wei spat out blood continuously, and cracks appeared on his body.

The bones on his body had been broken countless times, and he looked extremely bloody!

“Xia Hang, does Han Wei still have a chance to win?” Yan Sihai seemed to be unable to hold it in anymore as he watched Xia Hang coldly and said coldly.

Xia Hang took a deep breath and said, “Mr. Yan, don’t worry, Han Wei hasn’t used his trump card yet.”

Yan Sihai cursed loudly, “Then what the f * ck is he waiting for? Does he have to wait until he’s beaten to death? The Yan family has been completely humiliated by you!”

Xia Hang didn’t dare to say anything. His expression was unsightly, and he couldn’t stop cursing inside.

Xia Hang thought to himself, ‘I told you to make a move earlier, but you didn’t listen. Who are you trying to blame now?!’

“Boom!”

On the battlefield, Qin Yu threw a punch. It was as if he was holding the power of the universe in his hand as he ruthlessly punched Han Wei!

“Ah!!”

However, Han Wei, who was lying on the ground like a dead dog, let out an explosive roar at this moment!

His internal qi was rising at a speed visible to the naked eye. In just a short moment, he surpassed the half-step Martial Marquis Realm and reached the Martial Marquis Realm!

“Bang!”

Han Wei waved his hand, and Qin Yu’s punch was easily dissolved!

“Qin Yu... I’m going to kill you!!” Han Wei clenched his hands and roared angrily!

A terrifying internal qi swept over, and under this internal qi, Qin Yu was pushed back!

“He’s... a Martial Marquis!” Someone shouted in shock!

“Han Wei actually stepped into the Martial Marquis Realm at this moment?!”
