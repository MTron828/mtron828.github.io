Chapter 626: Kill Them! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu immediately felt that something was wrong.

He said anxiously, “Hurry up and say it. I promise I won’t vent my anger on your daughter.”

Xia Hang was silent for a moment, and then slowly said, “The super powerhouses of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association... were all created with Miss Yan’s blood. This is also the reason why we took Miss Yan away...”

“What?!” Qin Yu stood up angrily.

He glared at Xia Hang and said through gritted teeth, “Explain to me clearly!”

Xia Hang knew that Qin Yu would definitely be furious, so he didn’t look too surprised.

He lit a cigarette and then said, “Rumor has it that Miss Yan’s bloodline isn’t simple. People with such a bloodline will have strength beyond imagination.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Every day, we will extract blood from Miss Yan’s body to supply the talented members of the Association.”

“Those three people are our test subjects.”

Anger arose in Qin Yu.

His veins bulged and his eyebrows stood up. The murderous aura from his body filled the entire room. Even Xia Hang felt a chill.

“Jingdu Martial Arts Association...” Qin Yu only felt a stabbing pain in his chest. He was overcome with anger.

“You actually used Ruoxue’s blood to nurture others... you bunch of animals!”

Xia Hang fiercely took a puff of his cigarette and said, “Don’t worry, Miss Yan’s life will be safe. We have always been feeding her with top-notch herbs. There’s no need to be angry.”

“No need to be angry?” Qin Yu’s eyes were bloodshot.

“If I were to hang your daughter up, draw her blood every day, and give her the best panacea, would you be willing?!”

Xia Hang’s face turned pale. He said in a slightly panicked tone, “Qin Yu, don’t be rash.”

Qin Yu suppressed the anger in his heart and tried his best to calm himself down.

He never thought that these so-called super powerhouses would actually suck Yan Ruoxue’s blood for their own benefits!

“You guys... are really a bunch of vampires.” Qin Yu panted heavily.

Xia Hang kept silent. He knew that this matter would definitely make Qin Yu furious, but he had no other way.

Qin Yu sat there and didn’t speak for a long time.

He took Xia Hang’s cigarette and took a puff.

“Where are the three so-called super powerhouses?” Qin Yu asked coldly.

Xia Hang was stunned and asked in confusion, “What do you want to do?”

“I want to kill them,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Xia Hang, I’m not afraid to tell you that from today onwards, as long as the Jingdu Martial Arts Association produces any super powerhouses, I will kill them all!”

“I will not spare a single person who used Yan Ruoxue’s blood! Until you guys give up.”

This news made Xia Hang secretly happy.

As the vice president of the Martial Arts Association, he naturally knew how powerful those three super powerhouses were.

If Qin Yu went to look for them, wouldn’t that be courting death?

Therefore, Xia Hang didn’t even think about it and directly said, “They go to Dingsheng Bar to drink at night. You might be able to try your luck.”

Qin Yu glanced at Xia Hang and said, “You’d better not lie to me, or else... you’ll have to bear the consequences.”

Xia Hang spread his hands and said, “I swear to God, I’m not lying to you.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He got up and was about to leave.

After taking two steps, Qin Yu suddenly turned around and walked toward Xia Hang’s daughter’s room.

“What... What are you doing?!” Xia Hang was shocked and hurriedly chased after him.

Qin Yu sat beside the little girl and said with a smile, “This is the latest candy bean. Do you want to try it? It’s very sweet.”

The little girl didn’t know the relationship between Qin Yu and Xia Hang. She sniffed the pill and was quickly captivated by the smell of the pill.

“Qin Yu, what are you trying to do?!” Xia Hang reached out to snatch the pill but was grabbed by Qin Yu’s wrist.

“Don’t worry, this is a pill I made myself. As long as you cooperate with me, not only will this pill not harm your daughter, but it will bring her benefits instead,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Of course, if you dare to spread this news, this pill will immediately become a deadly poison!”

Xia Hang’s expression was extremely unsightly. He clenched his fists tightly and said coldly, “You better guarantee that this pill won’t harm my daughter, otherwise... I will kill you even if I have to risk my life!”

“I don’t have to touch your daughter,” Qin Yu stood up and said.

He walked to the door and stopped. He said in a deep voice, “I don’t want anyone to know that I’m still alive for the time being, so... you know what to do.”

After saying this, Qin Yu left directly.

As he looked at Qin Yu’s departing figure, Xia Hang’s expression was ferocious, but he was helpless.

...

In the dark night, a man dressed in a black robe was walking in a hurry.

This person was none other than Qin Yu.

He came all the way to Dingsheng Bar and casually found a seat to sit down at.

Dingsheng Bar was extremely famous in Jingdu. It was said that most of the people who came here were rich young masters or popular celebrities.

Their clothes were luxurious, and Qin Yu’s black robe seemed to be out of place.

Under the black robe, Qin Yu’s expression was extremely cold.

Even though he covered up the murderous aura on his body, people could still feel a trace of coldness.

“Damn it...”

Xia Hang’s words rang in Qin Yu’s mind.

He wished that he could immediately rush to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association and save her.

However, the current Qin Yu was no longer that rash and impulsive person. He knew very well that if he went to the Martial Arts Association now, not only would he not be able to save her, he would even lose his life.

After sitting down, Qin Yu released his divine sense.

Very soon, he caught the figures of several martial artists.

“Huh? There’s actually a Martial Marquis?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and couldn’t help but glance at a place not far away.

He saw a woman sitting not far away. When Qin Yu looked at her, her eyes also happened to look at Qin Yu.

“Why is there a Martial Marquis in this small bar?” Qin Yu frowned.

One had to know that there weren’t many Martial Marquises in this world. It was rare to see one on a normal day.

Just as Qin Yu was thinking, this woman actually walked toward Qin Yu.

“Want to have a drink?” The woman handed Qin Yu a glass of wine.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything and ignored this woman.

The woman continued, “As a Martial Marquis, you wrapped yourself so tightly. You must be here to kill someone.”

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold and he said, “It has nothing to do with you. I advise you to mind your own business.”

The woman ignored him and continued, “There aren’t many people in this world who can make things difficult for a Martial Marquis. You want to kill someone, yet you wrapped yourself up so tightly. The person you want to kill must be powerful.”

Qin Yu’s expression gradually turned cold. He took a sip of wine and said coldly, “People who are too smart will get themselves killed.”
