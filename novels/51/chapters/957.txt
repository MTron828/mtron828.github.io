Chapter 958: Chapter 958, all the way to nine Pinnacles Mountain!

For the next few days, everyone ate, lived, and traveled on nine Pinnacles Mountain.

Xu Huaigu had a vegetable garden on the mountain, filled with pure natural, pollution-free vegetables.

Other than that, he also raised chickens, ducks, and fish on the mountain, living quite happily.

“Zhuang Teng, by the way, what’s the name of your sword? Why is it so fierce?”

On this day, after they finished eating, Chang Mang asked.

Speaking of this, Zhuang Teng immediately said with some pride, “This sword is called Taihe. It was passed down by my grandfather’s grandfather. It is the most precious treasure of our family!”

“Taihe? That’s a good name.”Qin Yu nodded slightly.

“The prison of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association is all made of black gold stone, but this sword can be unfurled in one strike. It is considered a divine sword.”

Zhuang teng said somewhat proudly, “Of course! It is said that my grandfather’s grandfather once used this sword to slay a dragon! But my father did not pass on the sword technique to me. It is said that this sword technique can ensure the prosperity of my family’s Patriarch!”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Then if you take out the sword, your father will not deal with you, right?”

Zhuang Teng said with a grin, “Of course I took it out secretly. If he finds out, he will definitely beat me to death.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu could not help but say gratefully, “Thank you very much.”

“It’s okay. This is nothing.”Zhuang Teng waved his hand.

Qin Yu raised his head to look at the sky and could not help but sigh slightly.

At night.

Qin Yu sat alone on the Kang.

He looked out of the window.

A full moon hung in the sky. The moonlight shone on Qin Yu’s face, making it snow-white.

“Everyone knows when one has comprehended the Dao...”Qin Yu muttered softly.

“Senior Xu Huaigu, are you saying that you need to comprehend the Dao to become a martial saint?”

Qin Yu tried to grasp the Great Dao, but this did not give him any enlightenment.

The next morning, Qin Yu arrived in front of Xu Huaigu’s house early in the morning.

At this moment, Xu Huaigu was planting vegetables in the courtyard. When he saw Qin Yu, he put down the hoe in his hand.

“Senior Xu Huaigu, I wonder if I could have a moment of your time. I would like to discuss Dao with you,”Qin Yu said.

Xu Huaigu nodded. He sat cross-legged on the ground and motioned for Qin Yu to sit as well.

Qin Yu did not say anything more and immediately sat down in Xu Huaigu’s conversation.

“Senior Xu Huaigu, when you say that you will comprehend dao in one day, are you referring to comprehending the Great Dao?”Qin Yu asked tentatively.

Xu Huaigu did not answer this question. Instead, he asked, “What is the purpose of your cultivation?”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He scratched his head and said, “The purpose of my cultivation has always been changing. Initially, I wanted to get out of a difficult life. Later on, it was for Yan Ruoxue.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Later on... wanting to become stronger seemed to have become one of my pursuits. However, it was mostly because of Yan Ruoxue.”

Xu Huaigu nodded slightly, and then asked, “Then do you know the purpose of my cultivation, and what is it?”

Qin Yu shook his head, indicating that he did not know.

Xu Huaigu looked at the vegetable garden in front of him and said, “Everyone knows that my talent is mediocre and I don’t like to fight for it. I only love a Pure Land. I once thought that this was my path.”

Qin Yu looked at Xu Huaigu with some surprise and said, “What happened after that?”

Xu Huaigu smiled and said, “I realized that I don’t only favor a Pure Land, but also people, things, and everything within my sight.”

Qin Yu touched his chin and looked at Xu Huaigu with a confused expression. No one knew what he was thinking about.

“There are some things that you can only rely on yourself to comprehend. Only after you have fully comprehended them will you be able to step into another realm,”Xu Huaigu said.

“If it was purely based on talent, the person who would be the first to step into the Martial Saint Realm would definitely not be me.”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, as if he had understood something.

“I understand.”Qin Yu stood up and said.

Xu Huaigu looked at Qin Yu, as if he wanted to know something.

Qin Yu continued, “The Dao that you cultivate is great love, and not a remote corner.”

“You relied on hard work and hard work to step into the Martial Marquis realm, but you were unable to rely on hard work and hard work to step into the martial saint realm.”

“What truly allowed you to step into the martial saint realm was to comprehend the Dao of great love.”

Xu Huaigu nodded his head approvingly. He slowly stood up and picked up the hoe again.

“Qin Yu, nothing can be accomplished overnight. Otherwise, what you will obtain in the end will always be nothing.”

Xu Huaigu said as he plowed the ground.

Qin Yu bowed slightly to Xu Huaigu and said, “Thank you, I understand.”

Everyone had their own path of cultivation. If one wanted to become a martial saint, they must find their own path.

Once, a long time ago, Qin Yu had had such an epiphany. However, at that time, he did not take it to heart.

Today, after Xu Huaigu’s reminder, Qin Yu finally understood.

“My own dao... this path, how should I find it?”Qin Yu sighed slightly.

Other than Yan Ruoxue, Qin Yu did not know what else he wanted.

However, based on emotion alone, it was impossible for it to become his great dao of cultivation.

“Perhaps senior Jiang he also understood this principle, so he left the mystic realm,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Then, Qin Yu turned around and returned to his own residence.

He sat in his room, trying to find his own path.

The others were also discussing countermeasures on the mountain.

Nine Pinnacles Mountain looked like a pure land, a residence that protected everyone.

But at this time, Gu Xinghe and the other secret realms were preparing to attack nine pinnacles mountain.

In the reception hall of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, the people from the secret realms had already arrived.

Gu Xinghe swept his gaze across the crowd and said coldly, “Qin Yu, Kong Yun, and the others have kidnapped the prisoners of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. This is a great act of treason, and it is the wrath of both man and God.”

“In order to protect the legitimate rights and interests of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, it is necessary for us to take measures against them!”

Before this, the Jingdu martial arts association had never found an excuse to take action against Zhuang Teng and the others.

But now, their actions gave Gu Xinghe a proper reason, a reason that no one could find fault with.

“We’ve already found their location. They’re all gathered at nine Pinnacles Mountain,”Gu Xinghe continued.

“Nine Pinnacles Mountain is Xu Huaigu’s residence. If he wants to protect Qin Yu and the other prisoners, we can only execute him!”

“That’s right. If he protects the prisoners, he’s also a prisoner!”Someone said.

They all knew that these words were just an excuse to attack.

Gu Xinghe slowly stood up and said coldly, “Everyone, follow me to nine Pinnacles Mountain! This time, I want all the prisoners to be punished!”

“Okay!”

Everyone in the secret realm also stood up in unison!
