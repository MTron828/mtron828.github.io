He stopped what he was doing and looked up at the scene in the sky.

There was no sadness or joy on his face, only a trace of surprise.

A moment later, a smile appeared on his face.

This person was none other than the long-lost sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect!

“The sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect is just a coward, while your Southern Region is a bunch of trash.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, a rumbling sound came from the sky.

Upon hearing this, the smile on the sect master’s face became even wider.

At this moment, at the northern border, an elementalist was leading a large group of people and was planning to occupy the southern region at any time!

However, he was not in a hurry to attack. Instead, he looked down at everyone as if he was waiting for something.

The southern region cultivators were in extreme despair. Facing such a powerful northern region master, they could not find any reason to resist!

“Everything... is over.”

“Once the northern region takes over the southern region, they will definitely not treat us well. I’m afraid they will absorb all of us...”

At this moment, the various large sects also took out beast spirit pills and prepared for a big battle.

At the northern border, the elementalist had his hands behind his back. He clearly looked like a young man, but his aura was terrifyingly powerful!

“It seems that the leader of the Heavenly Cloud sect will not show himself,”the Elementalist said coldly.

He raised his palm and was ready to give the order for a full-scale attack!

However, at this moment, a portrait appeared in front of him!

There was a man standing in the portrait. The man was slender and dressed in white. His aura was extremely peaceful.

Compared to the Elementalist’s domineering aura, this man appeared extremely gentle.

The elementalist looked coldly at the man in the portrait and asked, “Who are you?”

“Haven’t you been looking for me?”The Man in the portrait asked indifferently.

The elementalist’s pupils constricted as he asked coldly, “You’re the Sect Master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect? !”

The southern region immediately erupted into an uproar when he said this!

“The sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect! It’s the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect!”

“Finally, he’s finally willing to show himself!”

“I knew it. How could the dignified sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect allow a youth to bully him like this!”

At this moment, the deputy sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect was so excited that he almost jumped up!

He had waited for so long, but the sect master had finally shown himself!

“Kill him, kill him!”The Deputy Sect Master clenched his fists and gnashed his teeth as he said this.

In the sky, the two of them were talking across the sky.

The elementalist put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “I thought you were planning to be a coward. Why? Are You Afraid of Me?”

The sect master smiled and shook his head. Then, he sighed and said, “You’re not the master of the northern lands.”

“Oh? Then who do you think I am?”The elementalist asked in a teasing tone.

The sect master continued to shake his head and said, “You’re not the master of the northern lands. At least, you’re not the Master of the northern lands that I remember.”

The elementalist frowned slightly and said coldly, “Why do you say that?”

“The master of the northern lands... shouldn’t be so weak,”the sect master said with a sigh.

Once he said that, the southern region was once again in an uproar!

He shouldn’t be so weak! It was obvious that the sect master did not put the Master of the northern lands in his eyes at all!

The Elementalist’s expression immediately turned ugly. With a gloomy face, he said, “You say that I’m weak? Then why don’t you dare to fight me?”

“You’re not worthy of my attack.”The sect master shook his head and said, “If the so-called northern lord only has this bit of strength, then I’m really disappointed.”

The elementalist’s expression was gloomy and uncertain. A moment later, he laughed loudly and said, “That’s right! This is only my youth. The real me has yet to awaken! But... Killing You is enough!”

“You’d better wait for your local to come. Otherwise, I won’t make a move.”The sect master shook his head.

The elementalist was furious. “Even if I was a youth, I could easily kill you! Do you dare to tell me where you are!”

The sect master was silent for a moment before he said, “Have you stepped into the return to Void Realm Now?”

The elementalist was stunned before he sneered. “Of course not.”

“Then it’s not worth my time.”The sect master’s tone gradually turned cold.

“No one below the virtual entity stage is my match,”the sect master said coldly.

The elementalist raised his eyebrows before he sneered, “What about above the virtual entity stage?”

“Above the virtual entity stage... I will kill you as well!”The sect master’s tone instantly became extremely overbearing!

Even though it was just a phantom image, it still caused one’s entire body to tremble!

The Elementalist’s eyes narrowed slightly.

“Who doesn’t know how to Talk Big? If you really have the ability, then stand out and fight with me!”The elementalist shouted loudly.

“I’ve already said that you’re not worthy of me fighting with someone like you,”the sect master said coldly.

He grabbed the hoe and said indifferently, “Alright, it’s time for me to hoe the ground.”

After saying that, the sect master raised his palm and intended to erase this phantom image.

The elementalist immediately became anxious. he shouted angrily, “Sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect! If you don’t show yourself, everyone in the Southern Region will die!”

“Don’t worry. Someone will come to kill you. You should give the young people a chance to stand out.”The sect master’s voice became increasingly distant, and the scene slowly disappeared.

The elementalist stood there with an extremely cold expression.

The sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect was clearly humiliating him!

As the leader of the northern lands, when had he ever suffered such humiliation? !

“You boastful thing...”the elementalist clenched his fists. The murderous aura emanating from his body was extremely cold.

He raised his palm and said coldly, “If that’s the case, then don’t blame me for being impolite.”

Just as the elementalist was about to give the order, the illusory figure in front of him trembled.

Soon after, a white-haired old man walked out.

This old man looked rather old and his aura was as still as an ancient well. However, his every action seemed to coincide with the Great Dao and was extremely mysterious!

“Who are you?”The elementalist narrowed his eyes slightly.

The old man placed his hands behind his back and said, “I’m Han Yan.”

“Han Yan?”There seemed to be someone who recognized this person across the Southern Region!

“Old Monster Han Yan from back then? One of the nine holes, Han Yan? Isn’t he already dead? !”

“Nine holes? Back then, the nine holes were the best in the world. But for some reason, they all disappeared one day. Rumor has it that they’re all dead. I didn’t expect him to still be alive!”

The elementalist narrowed his eyes slightly and said with a hint of ridicule, “How come I’ve never heard of You?”

Han Yan placed his hands behind his back and said with a sigh, “When our nine caves were at their peak, it was already history. At that time, you should still be in a deep sleep.”

“Later, our nine caves joined forces and prepared to kill Xiao Sheng, the current sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect. Unfortunately, we failed.”

“Fortunately, Xiao Sheng’s residence was kind-hearted and spared our lives. The price was that he hid himself from the world and sacrificed himself during the crisis in the southern region.”

“I think it’s time now.”

Han Yan raised his head and slowly told the history.

After hearing Han Yan’s words, everyone in the South Province was dumbfounded and shocked!
