Hearing Su Qian’s words, Qin Yu quickly turned around.

“Where is she?” Qin Yu’s tone was somewhat anxious.

Su Qian smiled faintly and said, “This doesn’t seem like a place to talk, right?”

Qin Yu frowned. Although he was anxious, he still brought Su Qian to a cafe.

After ordering two cups of coffee, Qin Yu said impatiently, “Now you can tell me.”

Su Qian took a sip of coffee and said in a deep voice, “According to our information, Miss Yan is still in Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

“Impossible,” Qin Yu shook his head.

“I went to Jingdu Martial Arts Association and released my divine sense to look for Yan Ruoxue, but I couldn’t find her,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Su Qian wasn’t in a hurry. She smiled and said, “Mr. Qin, have you ever thought that Jingdu Martial Arts Association might have a small world, which is also a Mystic Realm?”

“A small world?” Qin Yu was instantly stunned.

To Qin Yu, this was a completely new concept. He had never heard of it before.

Su Qian explained, “Yes, it’s said that the Mighty Realm can create a small world by itself. It’s also called a Mystic Realm.

“Human history is long and far. There are naturally many small mystic realms in the world.

“And I can tell you that the real resources are sealed in the Mystic Realm!

“This secret is soon unable to keep. The higher-ups have already sent people to investigate this matter.”

Qin Yu could not help but widen his eyes.

This had completely overturned Qin Yu’s understanding.

Before this, Qin Yu had never even thought about this because it sounded too unbelievable!

“Are you kidding me?” Qin Yu said with narrowed eyes.

“What you said is hard to believe. The so-called mystic realm, small world, it’s simply hard to believe.”

Su Qian seemed to have guessed Qin Yu’s attitude long ago, so she was not surprised. Instead, she smiled and said, “You don’t believe it?”

“Of course I don’t,” Qin Yu sneered and said.

Su Qian said indifferently, “I can only tell you that Hong Yi Sect controls a mystic realm in the country, and that place is also our base in the country.”

Qin Yu’s pupils suddenly constricted! He stood up and said, “Is what you said true?”

“If Mr. Qin doesn’t believe me, you can follow me to take a look. It’s clear at a glance whether it’s true or not,” Su Qian said indifferently while swaying the coffee in her hand.

Qin Yu instantly frowned even more.

Su Qian didn’t look like she was lying, but her words were really hard to believe.

Moreover, the enmity between Qin Yu and the Hong Yi Sect was not only a day or two. Following Su Qian rashly, Qin Yu was indeed worried about it.

“Let me think about it.” After thinking for a while, Qin Yu looked at Su Qian.

Su Qian smiled and said, “Certainly, Mr. Qin. We are very sincere to you.”

Qin Yu didn’t say much about it. He said goodbye to Su Qian and left the cafe.

...

Qin Yu humiliated Qu Xie in public and even make him die tragicallyat the Taoism Theory Library.

This news spread throughout the entire martial arts world.

Everyone was waiting for Jingdu Martial Arts Association to take revenge.

But what was surprising was that the association did not take any action.

The reason was none other than Qu Xie’s words, which had caused the eight higher-ups not to dare to act in a high-profile manner.

This also gave Qin Yu a chance to catch his breath.

At night.

Qin Yu took out his cell phone and called Xia Hang.

After the call was connected, Xia Hang took the lead and said, “I have something to tell you.”

Qin Yu acknowledged and signaled Xia Hang to continue.

Xia Hang said, “I am now the president of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

“Congratulations,” Qin Yu said lightly.

Xia Hang continued, “The information released by Qu Xie has already attracted the attention of the higher-ups. The Grand Secretary personally gave me an order to come up with a suitable plan.”

Qin Yu smiled, “So?”

Xia Hang said in a deep voice, “I plan to make use of Jingdu Martial Arts Academy again and release a portion of the resources controlled by Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

Qin Yu’s expression did not look too good when Jingdu Martial Arts Academy was mentioned.

Xia Hang seemed to have guessed something on the other end. He quickly explained, “Qin Yu, don’t worry. The martial arts academy this time has nothing to do with Miss Yan.”

“At the same time, Jingdu Martial Arts Association isn’t in the mood to target you anymore. During this period of time, I’m afraid they will have to keep a low profile for a while.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “Continue.”

Xia Hang said in a deep voice, “Previously, Jingdu Martial Arts Academy had a list. All the young masters of the various well-known families were on the list. However, because of you, the academy wasn’t able to launch it. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Now, I plan to let these people be the first batch of students. I’ll treat it as an experiment. If it works, I’ll openly recruit students.”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment and said, “Do as you wish.”

“Alright,” Xia Hang agreed.

Then, Xia Hang asked, “Why are you looking for me?”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said in a deep voice, “Let me ask you, does Jingdu Martial Arts Association control the so-called mystic realm?”

Xia Hang said in surprise, “How do you know about it?”

“So it’s actually true,” Qin Yu frowned.

“Where are those mystic realms?” Qin Yu continued to ask.

Xia Hang shook his head and said, “I don’t know either. The mystic realms should be distributed in every corner of the world.

“Oh yes, the mystic realms are also one of the resources of Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu said coldly over the phone, “Xia Hang, help me check if there are any mystic realms near Jingdu Martial Arts Association and how to open this mystic realm.”

Xia Hang was stunned and frowned, “Qin Yu, what do you want to do?”

“No need to ask. Just do as I say,” Qin Yu said.

After hanging up the phone, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

What Su Qian said was indeed true.

It seemed that this Hong Yi Sect was indeed not simple...

In the following few days, Qin Yu had a rare moment of leisure.

Ever since Xie Qu’s death, everything seemed to have calmed down a lot. Even the various families had become rather low-key.

For the past few days, Qin Yu didn’t leave the Green Moon Villa.

He struggled for a long time, but in the end, he still took out his phone and dialed Su Qian’s number.

After the call was connected, Su Qian smiled and said, “Mr. Qin, have you thought it through?”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “I want to see the so-called mystic realm of your Hong Yi Sect.”

“Certainly, you’re welcome anytime,” Su Qian said with a faint smile.

“See you at Qing City Airport tomorrow morning.”

After saying this, Su Qian directly hung up the phone.

Su Qian said that the mystic realm was a precious resource. What exactly was in it?

Qin Yu couldn’t help but look forward to it.
