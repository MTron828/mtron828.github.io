Chapter 940: Chapter 940, understanding each other 

The Golden Light appeared and instantly closed in on the immortal crane!

The immortal crane resisted the pressure brought by the power of the Divine Dragon and raised its hand to meet Qin Yu!

At the moment of collision, the immortal crane was forced back three steps!

However, Qin Yu’s condition was not much better. He only felt that his fist was in pain from the Impact!

“What a powerful physical body!”Qin Yu could not help but sigh!

This was probably the most powerful physical body Qin Yu had ever seen!

Shock also flashed across Immortal Crane’s face.

He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “If you were to become a martial saint, I might not be your match.”

Qin Yu grinned and said, “Among those of the same level, you are also the strongest opponent I have ever met!”

After he finished speaking, Qin Yu charged towards immortal crane again!

This time, the Immortal Crane’s body emitted a faint white light!

His strength instantly increased by a few points!

Both sides trembled in an instant. Both of them used all their trump cards and kept on fighting!

The entire grotto-heaven exploded from time to time. The battle between both sides attracted the attention of countless people!

The battle between the two continued for a full three hours.

After three hours, the sweat on the crane’s forehead grew more and more, as if it couldn’t withstand the pressure anymore.

Both of them had suffered different injuries, and Qin Yu was obviously more serious!

This couldn’t help but Shock Qin Yu to the bottom of his heart!

Being in the same level, Qin Yu actually couldn’t gain the upper hand, and was even suppressed by the crane!

One had to know that the crane was fighting under the pressure of the Divine Dragon’s power!

“So Strong...”Qin Yu wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, and a hint of caution appeared on his face.

At this moment, the immortal crane waved its hand and said, “Rest for a moment.”

Qin Yu was stunned, then nodded and said, “Okay.”

Therefore, Qin Yu found a seat and sat down, waiting for the immortal crane.

On this day, the two sides exchanged blows three times, and it only ended when the sky turned dark.

Qin Yu’s injuries seemed to be very serious and even walking was somewhat difficult.

Helplessly, he had no choice but to carry Qin Yu back with his handlebar mustache.

“Did he really suppress his cultivation to the half-step martial saint realm...”lying on the bed, Qin Yu could not help but feel somewhat vexed and a sense of defeat arose spontaneously.

The handlebar mustache on the side rolled his eyes and said, “Enough, don’t be unsatisfied. If it were an ordinary person, I’m afraid they would be instantly killed.”

Even though that was the case, Qin Yu still couldn’t calm down for a long time.

Ever since he made his debut, he had never suffered a defeat in the same cultivation level! And the appearance of the immortal crane had completely overturned Qin Yu’s worldview. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The next day, Qin Yu went to the grotto-heaven as usual and fought with the immortal crane.

On this day, Qin Yu was still at a slight disadvantage.

It was the same on the third day and the same on the fourth day.

Ten days later.

Qin Yu and Immortal Crane were already at a draw.

During the halftime interval, Qin Yu couldn’t help but smile bitterly. “I haven’t improved at all after so many days...”

Immortal Crane glanced at Qin Yu and said coldly, “Your improvement is much greater than I imagined. You are the strongest human I have ever seen.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Is there? But it has been ten days, and I have just been able to tie with you...”

“Don’t forget that while you’re improving, my fear of the Divine Dragon’s power is also gradually disappearing,”reminded immortal crane.

Qin Yu suddenly came to a realization!

That’s right! Immortal Crane’s pressure on the Divine Dragon’s power seemed to be slowly disappearing as well!

“I understand!”Qin Yu was instantly overjoyed.

He got up and bowed slightly to immortal crane, cupping his hands and saying, “Thank you!”

The Immortal Crane did not say a word. It just casually threw a pot of fine wine to Qin Yu.

After ten days of interaction, the relationship between the two seemed to be getting closer and closer.

In their spare time, the two began to chat casually.

After their conversation, they learned that their temperaments and personalities were somewhat similar.

The Immortal Crane had been a person who refused to admit defeat since he was young. When faced with demonic beasts that were stronger than him, he never yielded. In the end, he fought his way out and became a martial saint.

As for immortal crane, only the power of the divine dragon was unable to resist. That was why it left Qin Yu behind to cultivate with him.

“I never believed in bloodline suppression. I was born to be arrogant,”immortal crane said quietly.

Qin Yu could not help but admire immortal crane even more.

After immortal crane learned of Qin Yu’s story, it was also somewhat moved.

Especially after it learned of the conflict between Qin Yu and the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, as well as the fight with the young masters of aristocratic families, and so on.

“Alright, it’s time to continue.”The Immortal Crane emptied the wine in its hand and stood up to say.

“Alright!”Qin Yu nodded.

In the next few days.

Qin Yu and the immortal crane had basically maintained a level playing field.

And the immortal crane had been sweating profusely from the beginning until now, it could almost ignore the oppression of the Divine Dragon’s power.

Just as Qin Yu and the immortal crane were both cultivating, the fire country’s martial arts world had once again undergone a change.

Tian Xue Hong had re-established the immortal Slayer sect, and with the help of the white bone army, he was almost invincible!

Not only that, Tian Xue Hong had also massacred many of the martial artists in the current era, and the number of martial artists who had died at his hands was uncountable.

He had grabbed the martial artist’s spiritual sense and swallowed it into his stomach, using it to cultivate.

This caused the entire martial arts world to be filled with terror. As the “Leader”, Gu Xing he did not say a single word, as if he had not seen anything.

“Young Master Gu, isn’t Tian Xuehong’s actions a bit too much?”Zhai Xing asked with a frown.

Gu Xinghe put down the wine in his hand, glanced at Zhai Xing and said, “Too much? How is it too much?”

Zhai Xing said with some anger, “He treats human lives like grass and relies on the spiritual sense of a martial artist to cultivate. Isn’t this too much? !”

“Many innocent people have already died in his hands. Shouldn’t we do something?”

Gu Xinghe sneered, “Uncle Zhai Xing, aren’t you being too soft-hearted? A bunch of ants. What does it have to do with us?”

Zhai Xing’s face was ashen. Although he was angry, he did not know how to flare up.

“If you don’t stop him, I Will!”Zhai Xing gritted his teeth and said.

Gu Xinghe stopped Zhai Xing and said coldly, “You are not allowed to go either! Since my father has asked you to follow me, then you must listen to my orders!”

Zhai Xing’s body trembled slightly, as if he was trying to resist.

In the end, the furious Zhai Xing smashed the stone pillar in the main hall with one punch and left angrily.

Gu Xinghe snorted lightly and continued drinking.

He was not worried that Zhai Xing would betray him, because Zhai Xing’s loyalty to Gu Zi was beyond imagination.

...

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu had been in this city for twenty days.

During these twenty days, Qin Yu’s strength had increased rapidly, and even his realm had also increased greatly.

“It can end now.”

On the twenty-third day, the immortal crane said in a low voice.

Qin Yu cupped his hands and said, “Okay, I’ll listen to you.”

“During this period of time, I’m very grateful for your sparring partner,”said the immortal crane.

Qin Yu repeatedly waved his hand and said, “I should be the one thanking you. No wonder you can become the city lord here.”

Twenty-three days had made Qin Yu bow his head in admiration to the immortal crane.

Not only was his heart higher than the sky, his thoughts were even purer.

Such a character was rarely seen among human martial artists.
