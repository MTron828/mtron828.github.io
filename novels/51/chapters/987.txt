Chapter 988: Chapter 988, blind eyes!

Qin Yu looked coldly at the people around him, the killing intent on his body almost could not be suppressed.

“TSK TSK, what, Mr. Qin is planning to kill me to silence me and Bully Me?”

At this moment, someone walked out from the dark.

Looking over, he saw Wan Gu Qiong with his hands behind his back, smiling faintly.

Qin Yu’s eyes suddenly looked at Wan Gu Qiong.

“What has it got to do with you?”Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said.

Wan guqiong smiled faintly and said, “It doesn’t have anything to do with me, but I just can’t Stand Your Behavior.”

“F * ck your mother. Do you think you are qualified to stand out and pretend to be a good person?”Qin Yu said coldly.

Feeling the killing intent bursting out from Qin Yu’s body, Wan Guqiong hurriedly took two steps back and pretended to be innocent, saying, “Let’s talk and not fight. If you have the ability, then be reasonable.”

“Yes... Yes.”The others also whispered.

Qin Yu took a deep breath.

He wanted to tear wan guqiong into pieces immediately.

This treacherous look really made people hate him.

“I’ll say it again. I didn’t do this. Someone is framing me,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“As for the spell you said, I’m not the only one who can use it. There are many people in the world who know it.”

“Then how do you explain this hat?”Wan guqiong sneered.

Although Qin Yu didn’t want to talk to him, he still held back his anger and took out his thousand-faced hat.

“This is my hat. That one is fake,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“I don’t need to say more to frame you.”

The people around looked at each other and seemed to waver.

Wan guqiong said sarcastically, “Who knows if the hat in your hand is fake or not? After you went home and saw that the hat was lost, of course, you have to hurry up and get a fake one, right?”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything and directly put the hat on his head.

In an instant, the thousand faces took effect and covered Qin Yu’s face.

“See? If it’s fake, how can it have such an effect?”Qin Yu said coldly.

Wan guqiong snorted, “As far as I know, the other hat can also have the same effect.”

“Bullsh * T!”Qin Yu said coldly.

“Then tell him to take out the hat!”

Wan guqiong spread his hands and said, “The hat is not on me.”

“Then shut up!”Qin Yu shouted.

“What? As a citizen, don’t I have the right to question?”Wan guqiong mocked.

Qin Yu didn’t pay attention to Wan guqiong anymore. He glanced at the crowd and said, “Do you believe me?”

The crowd began to discuss in low voices.

After Qin Yu’s explanation, they seemed to be wavering.

“Mr. Qin doesn’t seem like that kind of person.”

“Yeah, he saved the building many times before. Why would he do such a Thing?”

“That’s hard to say. You Can’t judge a person by his appearance.”

While everyone was discussing, a group of people walked over from not far away.

“Excuse me.”A group of purple robes led the way.

They pushed aside the crowd and welcomed Gu Xinghe.

When he saw Gu Xinghe, Qin Yu’s expression instantly turned cold.

“It really has something to do with you,”Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said.

Gu Xinghe pretended to be confused and said, “What do you mean by that? Why don’t I Understand?”

Qin Yu sneered, “If you have any tricks, then quickly use them. Don’t talk nonsense.”

Gu Xinghe said faintly, “Qin Yu, since such a thing happened in the Elfy Society, as the person in charge of the martial arts association in Jingdu, of course, I have to come to understand the situation.”

“After a few days of investigation, we found that all the evidence pointed directly at you. What do you have to say?”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “If you want to add to the crime, there’s no need to say anything. Gu Xinghe, if I’m not wrong, this was done by He Teng, right?”

A trace of undetectable panic flashed in Gu Xinghe’s eyes, but it was fleeting.

“Don’t falsely accuse a good person,”Gu Xinghe said coldly.

“I know you won’t admit it, so I’ve long been prepared.”

With that, Gu Xinghe took out a video.

He opened the video and saw a figure shuttling back and forth.

This figure was dressed in a black robe, and his figure and back looked extremely similar to Qin Yu!

Most importantly, in the video, the black-clothed man’s technique was exactly the same as Qin Yu’s!

Seeing this video, the expressions of the surrounding people changed drastically, and they all took a step back!

“Did you all see that? Who else could it be but Qin Yu!”Gu Xinghe shouted.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said patiently, “I didn’t see my face in that video. Also, that hat isn’t mine at all. Mine is here.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Gu Xinghe said sarcastically, “I knew you would find a hat to replace it. Fine, I’ll make you convinced.”

After that, Gu Xinghe clapped his hands and a young man walked out from not far away.

This young man was none other than Luo Yang!

“I believe everyone knows who he is.”Gu Xinghe pointed at Luo Yang and said.

“I know, the Young Pavilion Master of the pavilion of Heavenly Secrets.”

“What does this matter have to do with him?”

Gu Xinghe sneered, “Qin Yu’s hat is called thousand faces and it was made by the pavilion of heavenly secrets. Qin Yu, you have to admit this, right?”

Qin Yu’s face was cold and he didn’t say a word.

“Luo Yang, please go and see if the hat in Qin Yu’s hand is the thousand faces of the pavilion of Heavenly Secrets,”Gu Xinghe said indifferently.

“Yes, Young Master Gu.”Luo Yang nodded.

He quickly walked towards Qin Yu.

Qin Yu lowered his head and looked at Luo Yang in front of him. He couldn’t help but emit a murderous aura.

“Luo Yang, you’ve already harmed me once,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Upon hearing this, Luo Yang hurriedly took two steps back and said in horror, “Qin... Qin Yu, don’t kill me. I... I can’t tell if it’s true or not. That’s enough, right? Please don’t kill me...”

“You!”Upon hearing this, Qin Yu was instantly enraged!

Luo Yang’s treachery was far beyond Qin Yu’s imagination!

“Qin Yu, is this a good way to threaten others?”Gu Xinghe took the opportunity to say.

“Luo Yang, just say it. I believe that everyone here will stand up for you!”

Luo Yang pretended to look at Qin Yu in horror. He took two steps back and whispered, “The hat in Qin Yu’s hand... is not a thousand faces at all...”

Once these words were said, the entire place was in an uproar!

Now, all the evidence pointed at Qin Yu!

Everyone hurriedly retreated. They could not help but look at Qin Yu with fear and a hint of disgust.

Qin Yu only felt that his chest was full of anger, and his body was more like a primitive beast imprisoned.

And this beast seemed to be about to explode at any time!

“I’ll say it again. This is all a frame-up by the martial arts association of Jingdu. You should know who I, Qin Yu, AM,”Qin Yu looked at the crowd and said while suppressing his anger.

But this time, no one responded to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu forcefully suppressed his anger and said, “None of you believe me?”

The scene was silent. The only response to Qin Yu was a look of disgust.

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh coldly.

“Hehe... hahahaha! A bunch of blind people!”Qin Yu said furiously.

“Alright, since you said that I did it, then I did it! I don’t need to explain to you anymore!”

As he spoke, the killing intent on Qin Yu’s body instantly exploded!
