2061 Meeting Him

However, after thinking about it, Qin Yu canceled this plan and decided to look for Jiang He.

Although Holy Saintess Gu seemed trustworthy, Qin Yu didn’t know her well at all. Saintess Gu was definitely an incredibly scheming person, and no one could see her through.

However, Jiang He was different. Qin Yu and Jiang He came from the same place. Not to mention he totally trusted him, but it was almost there.

“It’s said that the Jiang family is different from any other aristocratic family. I wonder if it’s true,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Jiang He told him this, and Qin Yu was skeptical.

This place was quite far away from the Jiang family, and Qin Yu needed to use the teleportation formation.

However, Qin Yu was in a tremendously dangerous situation now. He had just cursed the Holy Lord of the Si family, so the Si family’s killing order for Qin Yu was probably already everywhere.

“I hope their target is not me for now.” Qin Yu could only try his best to restrain his internal qi while praying silently in his heart.

He needed three teleportations formation to reach the Jiang family. Although Qin Yu tried his best to conceal his internal qi, he still felt extremely uneasy. He felt as if he was being watched by everyone wherever he went.

Just as Qin Yu had expected, the Si family had indeed put a bounty on his head.

As long as one could provide information on Qin Yu, one could either get 100 million spirit coins or even a condition on the Si family.

It was evident the Si family had endured Qin Yu to the extreme, almost equivalent to that mysterious person of the demon race.

In addition to the publicized bounty, the Si family had also issued a bounty to the number one assassin organization in the Holy Region.

This assassin organization was called Netherworld Palace.

Netherworld Palace was a mysterious assassin organization established for hundreds of years.

A group of righteous people had initially founded this organization to punish evil and uphold justice.

However, Netherworld Palace gradually degenerated as time passed, becoming corrupted and cruel. In the end, it became an assassin organization that killed for money.

Netherworld Palace was tremendously mysterious, and it had numerous top-notch martial artists. There were even rumors many True Saints were in Netherworld Palace, and no one was willing to provoke them.

Qin Yu, hearing this news, could not help but shrink his neck and mutter softly, “It seemed that the Holy Lord of the Si family is a petty person. I only scolded him a few words.”

Qin Yu did not doubt that if it weren’t for the existence of the Chaos Grave, the Si family would have sent True Saints to look for him.

Fortunately, there was no danger thus far. After two days, Qin Yu finally arrived at the Jiang family.

The Jiang family, one of the nine aristocratic families, was located in a beautiful landscape in the Holy Region.

The mountains here were stacked and overlapped, the green water flowed, the ancient trees reached the sky, and the birds circled around. It was like a paradise, full of poetry and harmony.

The huge stone lions on both sides were majestic as if they were telling the glorious history of the family.

On the gatehouse, the huge word “Jiang” was resplendent and dazzling.

As soon as he entered the gate, he saw platforms and pavilions on both sides of the winding path. The flowers and trees grew with luxuriant foliage, and the flowing water murmured. It was like a beautiful landscape painting scroll.

The Jiang family’s aura was not inferior to the Yan family’s. Although it did not stand high in the sky like the Yan family, it still made people feel an upsurge of emotion and awe-inspiring.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and walked forward. A natural barrier suddenly appeared, blocking Qin Yu’s path.

Following that, a phantom appeared in front of Qin Yu.

“Who’s barging into my Jiang family?” the phantom asked.

“This’s Jiang He’s friend,” Qin Yu hurriedly bowed and said. “Senior, please inform him that I’m waiting for him outside the door.”

“Who are you?” the phantom asked.

Qin Yu frowned. For a moment, he did not know if he should reveal his identity.

“I… I’m Jiang He’s friend,” Qin Yu said with some difficulty.

“You must be Qin Yu?” But the subsequent sentence of this phantom made Qin Yu’s expression change drastically!

Qin Yu opened his mouth, but in the end, he gritted his teeth and said, “I’m just a friend of Jiang He. If it’s not convenient, I’ll leave now. Sorry for disturbing you.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around to run away.

“It’s fine. I’ve already informed Jiang He. As for whether he wants to see you, that’s your business,” the phantom changed his words and agreed.

Then, the phantom disappeared without a trace.

“Phew.”

Qin Yu patted his chest and secretly said in a low voice, “These days of hiding are really not easy.”

Although Qin Yu had a good impression of the Jiang family, he was still fully prepared to run away.

As long as he saw something wrong, he would run.

A moment later, Qin Yu saw Jiang He’s figure.

He passed through the secluded path of the Jiang family alone and soon arrived in front of Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, why are you here?” Jiang He asked directly.

“Senior Jiang He, can we talk in private?” Qin Yu asked in a low voice.

Jiang He naturally understood Qin Yu’s intentions. He nodded slightly and said, “Come with me.”

After that, Jiang He brought Qin Yu to a Mystic Realm.

The Mystic Realm was not considered big, but it had beautiful mountains and rivers tastefully.

“This is my mansion. No one will come here.” Jiang He sat down cross-legged.

Qin Yu nodded. He took a deep breath and said, “Senior Jiang He, I want to make a deal with you.”

“A deal?” A hint of surprise flashed across Jiang He’s hoarse face.

Qin Yu nodded and said in a low voice, “I have the supreme bone.”

When Qin Yu said this, even Jiang He’s face could not help but tremble! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“You… have the supreme bone?” Jiang He suppressed the shock in his heart and asked as if he was confirming it.

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. He said, “That’s why I want to make a deal with the Jiang family. I want to exchange for a tribulation magical artifact with the supreme bone.”

Jiang He fell silent. He closed his eyes slightly, and no one knew what he was thinking.

“Forget it if it’s inconvenient. I’ll think of another way.” Seeing him not speak for a long time, Qin Yu planned to leave.

Jiang He shook his head and said, “No. Everyone is willing to exchange for the supreme bone with a tribulation magical artifact. It’s just that… this matter is of great importance. Are you sure that you have the supreme bone?”

“I’m absolutely sure,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“Alright, I’ll go back and report this matter now,” Jiang He stood up and said.

Qin Yu hurriedly shook his head. “No, Senior Jiang He, you mustn’t say you obtain this supreme bone from me. You can’t even let anyone know I came to see you today.”

Jiang He thought for a moment. He nodded and said, “I understand. I will think of a way. Tomorrow, you and I will meet at Mount Three Waters a hundred miles away.”

“Alright.” Qin Yu nodded and then reminded, “You must keep this matter a secret.”
