Chapter 2426 - 2426: The Return of the Lei Family’s Ancestors

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Lei Xin briefed Qingye on the current situation. Most of those who could break through to the Tribulation Second Level were famous people.

For the Yan family’s Holy Lord, Yan Tianshi, the Si family’s acting Holy Lord, Si

Liuhe, Lei Xin, Flower Granny, and the others, breaking through to the Tribulation Third Level Soul Sinking would be a matter of course if they were to settle down for a period.

“It’s also possible that the human race’s Path of Heaven is gradually weakening, and now the power of the Path of Heaven is being plundered by the alien races, causing the human race’s progress to slow down significantly.”

Lei Xin voiced out his suspicions. He alone might not have made such a judgment.

However, the human race had many people with exceptional talent. Currently, even the chosen one of the Path of Heaven, Teng Zixu, seemed to have only possessed the power of the third level. This indicated some problems.

“Hahaha, Lei Xin, you’re exaggerating. I would think that the Holy Region is too peaceful and comfortable. Everyone is like a greenhouse flower. As there’s no pressure, the cultivation is so low now. I was born in the year of the Path of Heaven and trained in the blood sea. Even in purgatory, where the Path of

Heaven is missing, I’ve broken through to the Peak of Tribulation Second Level

Soul Sinking. Soon, I’ll enter Tribulation Third Level.’

The young man beside Hua Qianjie shook his head, laughed, and said. He disagreed with what Lei Xin said.

He directly called out Dean Lei’s name, but the three people beside him did not object to it.

It was because he was Hua Qianjie’s son, Hua Zhikong. He belonged to the same generation as Lei Xin.

However, this behavior seemed a little harsh in the eyes of the people from Thunder Courtyard.

Dean Lei had been running Thunder Courtyard for many years. He was very concerned about all the disciples as a gentle and kind elder.

He did his best to help the disciples who had entered Thunder Courtyard. For Qin Yu, he had even used his celestial artifact to confront the nine great aristocratic families. However, at this moment, he was reprimanded by a young man who had appeared out of nowhere. This made many people display expressions of anger.

“Why? Do you have a problem with me?”

Hua Zhikong suddenly lifted his hand and caught hold of a disciple of Ethereal Peak in his hand.

“Slap!”

With a crisp sound, his dantian was directly destroyed. His meridians were completely destroyed by the violent spiritual energy. He was crippled straightaway.

The surrounding people immediately cried out in horror. No matter what, they were all disciples of the same sect. They did not expect Hua Zhikong to suddenly make a move and directly end the future of a Peak of True Saint disciple.

Qin Yu and Jue Wu looked at each other and felt that this person was too ruthless.

The most important thing for a sect was its people’s hearts. If they lost their unity and loyalty, who would be willing to give their all for the sect? Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Hmph, if anyone else is dissatisfied with me, you are welcome to challenge me at any time. However, if you don’t have the strength, tuck your tail between your legs. Do you understand what I mean?”

Hua Zhikong chuckled and threw the disciple of Ethereal Peak out like trash.

The peak master of Ethereal Peak caught him with a complicated expression. The disciple let out a heart-wrenching howl, his face filled with agony.

His cultivation of several thousands of years was destroyed in the blink of an eye, and he could only be an ordinary person in the future. This was simply unacceptable.

“Martial Uncle Hua Qianjie, this…”

Lei Xini frowned and wanted to say something, but Hua Qianjie stopped him.

“Zhikong is right. In the near future, you will experience an even more brutal invasion from the alien race. The weak are food for the strong will be the way of the future. Moreover, he’s from Thunder Courtyard but released killing intent toward the senior. He should be killed. Sparing his life is already an act of great mercy.”

Hua Qianjie was expressionless as if he was an unremarkable ant.

“I heard that someone has already obtained the inheritance of the immortal grave in Thunder Courtyard.”

Lei Huan suddenly raised a slightly narrowed eye and asked casually.

“Yes, Martial Uncle. My disciple Qin Yu has obtained the inheritance of Immortal Emperor Lei.”

Lei Xin’s heart skipped a beat.

His martial uncles should have known about this information long ago, but they had deliberately asked again. Did they have their thoughts?

“The person who obtained the inheritance is you, right?”

Lei Huan’s gaze suddenly stopped on Qin Yu. He was expressionless and his thoughts could not be read.

“Yes, Grandmaster. I have obtained the inheritance of Immortal Emperor Lei.” Qin Yu bowed slightly and showed his courtesy.

“Do you know Thunder Courtyard has a rule that the inheritor of the immortal grave must be a core disciple having the Lei family’s blood?”

“Martial Uncle Lei Huan, the last words left behind by Immortal Emperor Lei was that everyone in the Thunder Courtyard could inherit it if they have the ability.”

Lei Xin braced himself and said.

“Impudent!”

A crisp sound of thunder suddenly exploded in the air, and Lei Xin was sent flying. His chest was charred black, and he stood up with difficulty, spitting out a mouthful of blood.

Lei Huan stared at Qin Yu. A mountain-like pressure pressed down as if wanting to make Qin Yu kneel.

A massive force spread under Qin Yu’s feet and countless fine cracks appeared in the hard black rock. Within a few breaths, the cracks spread to a thousand meters away, but Qin Yu’s expression was calm as if he did not feel the terrifying pressure.

“Your strength is still passable. Hand over the Heart of Thunder. Of course, I’ll compensate you. I’ll pass on a Heaven Rank cultivation technique and reward you with a tribulation magical artifact.”

Hua Zhikong walked over and said with a smile.

“Martial Uncle, after I obtained the inheritance, the Heart of Thunder fused with my soul.”

Qin Yu said truthfully.

Hua Zhikong’s expression changed, and looked at Hua Qianjie. After confirming Qin Yu was telling the truth, his expression became tremendously gloomy.

He had originally planned to obtain the Heart of Thunder. It would be of great help to him in comprehending the Immortal Emperor Lei’s rules in the future.

But he did not expect the Heart of Thunder to take the initiative to fuse with Qin Yu’s soul.

“Martial Uncle, Qin Yu is Lei Xin’s direct disciple. He is loyal to the Thunder Courtyard. He possesses exceptional talent and intelligence. In the future, when great chaos descends, he will definitely become the pillar of support for

Thunder Courtyard.”

Flower Granny came to Hua Qianjie’s side and said softly.

“Earlier, Qin Yu had exterminated the Ji family by himself. Almost all the high-level combat strength of the Ji family were killed by him. Most of the resources of the Ji family have been collected, and Qin Yu has taken the initiative to hand them over to Thunder Courtyard. These resources can nurture a large number of geniuses with terrifying cultivation in the near future!”

Lei Xin also talked to the two Martial Uncles.

“I heard that he only handed over half of it.”

Hua Zhikong sneered.

Lei Xin was stunned for a few seconds before coming back to his senses.

“Yes, I made the decision to return half of them. Thunder Courtyard almost didn’t contribute anything to this matter. We basically relied on Qin Yu to exterminate the Ji family himself.”

“As a member of Thunder Courtyard, it’s only right for us to hand over the things we’ve seized before distributing them. Otherwise, why would Immortal

Emperor Lei leave behind an immortal grave, and why would the seniors of the Lei family set up this Thunder Courtyard? Is it to let outsiders take advantage?”

Hua Qianjie sneered and looked at Qin Yu..
