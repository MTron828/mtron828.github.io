Chapter 1291: Chapter 1291, the hearts of men are ancient 

A cold killing intent filled the entire hunter organization.

The brutal Ling Yun wanted nothing more than to slaughter everyone in front of him.

However, he took a deep breath in the end and said coldly, “I will issue the bounty. Everything is in accordance with the rules. As for the death of the leader that you mentioned, I have no idea.”

“Go to hell!”

“Stop pretending, who doesn’t know that it was you who instigated it!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“You will die a horrible death!”

Hearing these vicious curses, Ling Yun finally couldn’t hold it in anymore.

He shouted angrily, “Enough! I can give you a high reward! As long as anyone finds Qin Yu or provides him with relevant information, I will give him 200,000 spiritual coins!”

“Who cares about your stinky money!”

“That’s right, get out of Here!”

Ling Yun remained calm and continued to raise the price. “300,000.”

Hearing this number, the number of curses from the crowd decreased significantly.

Ling Yun continued to raise the price. “500,000.”

The number of curses decreased again, and many people were even tempted.

“One million!”Ling Yun shouted loudly.

Finally, with the high payment, the number of people who were cursing could be counted on one hand.

Money could make the devil turn the Millstone. This was an unchanging principle.

Even though Jing Bai was furious, he knew that he couldn’t change anything.

At this moment, Zhong Wu walked out from the darkness.

He smiled faintly. “Since Young Master Ling is willing to pay a high price, then we have no reason to reject.”

Jing Bai looked at Zhong Wu coldly. He opened his mouth but didn’t say anything in the end.

Ever since Qin Yu reminded him, he had been filled with suspicion towards Zhong Wu.

He was also very clear that Zhong Wu, who possessed the white bone scepter, didn’t know his opponent.

“Young Master Ling, this way please.”Zhong wu cupped his hands.

Under everyone’s watchful eyes, Ling Yun had been emptied out of another office and successfully signed the bounty order.

Once the bounty was issued, countless hunters came to take orders.

On the same day, hundreds of hunters stepped into green rock forest and embarked on the path to find Qin Yu.

At this moment, Qin Yu was slowly recovering from his injuries.

The disappearance of spiritual energy had both advantages and disadvantages. At the very least, it was very difficult for Qin Yu to be discovered by others, and it was also very difficult for him to become the target of demonic beasts.

He hid in a deep forest and waited quietly for his injuries to recover.

However, Qin Yu knew very well that this was definitely not a long-term plan. He would be found by Ling Yun sooner or later.

With the abilities of the Tianyun sect, it was not difficult to find a person.

If I want to escape, I have to go to the depths of Qingyan Forest and cross the boundary line, Qin Yu thought to himself.

However, this was even more unrealistic. There was still a long distance from the boundary line, and he had already seen extremely powerful demonic beasts.

If he took a few more steps forward, he was afraid that he would die without a doubt.

After my injuries recover, I must definitely kill that Ling Yun! Qin Yu made up his mind in his heart.

In the next few days, Qin Yu’s life was rather peaceful.

He lowered his head to look at the new flesh on his hands and said softly, “My injuries have almost recovered.”

Qin Yu clenched his fists lightly. He could still feel the pain.

It would be difficult for him to use his full strength.

At this moment, there was a sudden commotion in the forest.

Countless trees were uprooted. A huge demonic beast swooped down from the sky!

The terrifying wind was so strong that it seemed like it was going to flatten the entire green rock forest. Even Qin Yu felt an intense pressure.

Qin Yu frowned slightly as he looked at the demonic beast warily.

However, he soon realized that the demonic beast wasn’t coming for him at all. Instead, it was charging to the side!

“HMM? Could it be that a hunter is here? Or has Ling Yun and the rest found me?”Qin Yu muttered to himself.

He hurriedly hid and activated the desolate God’s eye to look in the direction of the Demonic Beast.

With the support of the desolate God’s eye, Qin Yu’s gaze passed through the Dark Valley and looked directly at the demonic beast.

He saw two hunters fighting with all their might against this demonic beast. However, this demonic beast was too powerful and wasn’t something they could fight against.

In just a short ten minutes, the two of them were beaten until they vomited blood and their bodies were almost shattered.

“No, if this continues, we will die here...”the two of them looked terrified.

“Run, run...”

The two of them turned around and wanted to escape, but the demonic beast did not give them a chance.

It was a flying spider with two arms. It spat out spider silk that looked like steel wires and quickly wrapped around the two of them!

The two of them struggled with all their might, but they found that they could not break free at all!

“It’s over... It’s over...”

They looked at the huge demonic beast in horror, their faces filled with despair.

Seeing that the flying spider was getting closer and closer, the huge bloody mouth emitted waves of foul internal QI.

Just as they were giving up, a figure suddenly shot over!

It was a thin body, but it contained an incomparably terrifying power.

A fist fiercely smashed onto the flying spider’s Head, instantly sending the flying spider back hundreds of meters!

The two of them hurriedly looked at the figure and exclaimed, “Qin... Qin Yu!”

Qin Yu turned around and glanced at them. He quickly walked in front of the two of them and used brute force to tear apart the spider silk on their bodies.

“How are you? Are you guys okay?”Qin Yu frowned and asked.

The two of them hurriedly got up from the ground, cupped their hands and said, “I’m fine. It’s just a superficial injury...”

Although that was what they said, in reality, their bones were already broken. It was a terrible sight.

“Why are you guys here? The demonic beasts here are too ferocious. It’s not suitable for you to hunt.”Qin Yu frowned and said.

The two of them looked at each other and said awkwardly, “We... We are lost.”

In the end, they didn’t reveal their true purpose. Qin Yu didn’t expect them to come looking for him.

“If there’s nothing else, leave this place quickly.”Qin Yu frowned.

The two of them nodded immediately. “Alright, Qin Yu. What about you? Do you want to continue staying here?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “This is a good place to hide. Ling Yun and the others won’t be able to find us anytime soon.”

The two of them didn’t say anything else.

After they greeted Qin Yu, they turned around and left quickly.

They only stopped when they were far away.

“I didn’t Expect Qin Yu to hide here,”one of them said.

“If we tell Ling Yun about this, we’ll be able to earn a million.”

At this moment, another person frowned and said, “But... Qin Yu just saved our lives. If it weren’t for him, we would have become the belly of that flying spider.”

“He saved us, but we betrayed him. Isn’t that inappropriate?”

“There’s nothing inappropriate about it. We Didn’t beg him to save us, not to mention that it was a million! Think about how long it would take us to earn a million spirit coins?”
