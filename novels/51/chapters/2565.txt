Chapter 2566 Sever the Restraints

A blade tainted with such power was not something ordinary cultivators could withstand.

Nearly all the human race touched the blade would instantly burn with intense demonic flames. In less than a few seconds, their bodies were burned to ashes, not even leaving behind their skeletons.

“Come to my back!”

Lei Xin roared and shielded the human race at this back. Hundreds of blades swiveled at him as if they had eyes.

“Hiss!”

A violent internal qi burst out from Lei Xin’s body. The Ninth Heaven Divine Thunder’s sixth level thunder descended from the sky.

The sixth-level thunder and lightning did not attack the monster race living beings but directly struck the top of his head.

The terrifying power of thunder and lightning completely turned Lei Xin into a shining thunder man. The power of thunder flowed through his body, elevating it to an unbelievable level.

“Boom!”

The Blade of Destruction slashed at Lei Xin’s body, cutting off one of his arms completely.

Lei Xin’s body fell to the ground, and he took a long time to stand up with difficulty.

The monster race’s holy energy on the blade kept destroying his body, making his wounds unable to recover.

“Senior Brother, don’t be afraid. Zhang Xiang and Li Yang of the Heavenly Divination Sect have brought their disciples to help you!”

Zhang Xiang and Li Yang were covered in blood, including the nearly 10,000 cultivators who followed them. They seemed to have just experienced a battle.

“Divine Will Sect is late. Please forgive me.”

Shen Qian, Shen Rou, and the group behind them also appeared in the distance.

They were also in a sorry state, and the people behind them were a mix.

There were Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivators, True Divine cultivators, Reversion Void Stage cultivators, and even ordinary people rushing over with weapons in their hands.

“You young fellows… Why are you so disobedient? I clearly sent a message to tell you all not to come!”

Xuan Xin’s fist, hidden in his sleeve, trembled slightly.

The Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect was the leader of the three sects. When Xuan Tian carried out missions, he would always endeavor to take care of his junior brothers and sisters.

“Hahaha, another batch of people is here to die.”

He Teng let out a strange laugh. Up until now, he had barely used his full strength.

Other than the Death Godly King dying, the others were like toying with rats. The strength of both sides was not on the same level at all.

A huge eyeball slowly rose, and He Teng’s face revealed a trace of surprise.

“You even took out the Eye of Destruction. It seems that the higher-ups have invested heavily this time.”

The enormous Eye of Destruction was covered in black blood vessels, and one could vaguely feel the manic emotions in its pupils.

It was the eye of the monster race Saint, Shimoji. It was not a dead object but a living eyeball.

It was something that Shimoji left behind in the universe to spread his will.

The moment the eye opened, it released a powerful energy beam.

Like the morning sun, it shone on the disciples of the Divine Will Sect and Heavenly Divination Sect who had just shown up.

This dark beam of light could penetrate all defenses. Even the supreme treasure, the Primordial Sky Concealing Bead, could not stop this power at all.

The dark holy energy destroyed all lives and turned everyone into ashes.

Nearly 30,000 human race instantly disappeared on the spot.

Many young people had just stepped onto the path of cultivation, and their eyes were full of longing.

They had the thought of defeating the monster race and reuniting with their fellow disciples in the sect.

Everyone was stunned. In fact, everyone knew that the people of these two sects had made tremendous efforts to show up here.

The fact that none of the elders of the two sects had appeared was a clear sign of their determination.

They had come here with great difficulty, yet they had vanished into thin air in such a manner.

Tears welled up in Xuan Xin’s eyes; so did the people behind him. A stream of water vapor blocked their chests, making them feel suffocated.

“Sect Master, please release the barrier.”

“Sect Master, please release the barrier.”

“Sect Master, please release the barrier.”

…

The long-eyebrow Elder Xuan Ming’s throat moved slightly, but he could not utter a sound.

“Sect Leader, please release.”

He said softly.

“Senior Brother, you’re going to lose.”

In the sky, Zi Yang’s expression was calm.

They were chatting like old friends. The demonic clouds in the sky rolled over and slowly compressed the multicolored light. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Their internal qi clashed ten thousand times every second.

Chen Shuang was silent and seemed to be absent-minded.

“In this world, these people are all I once cared about. However, if you want to go from a Saint to a divinity, these people will be like chains firmly locking you down.”

He raised his head and opened up his arms.

“Junior Brother, do you feel my divine kingdom’s internal qi is getting increasingly stronger? That feeling of being filled with power even makes me feel like I can continue tearing this Kingdom of Saint apart.”

Chen Shuang was silent. Suddenly, his face turned ashen as an internal qi penetrated him.

“Return your soul to the divine kingdom. With the divine kingdom, even if your mortal body is destroyed, you won’t die. Even if you’re at your peak, you’re no match for me.”

Zi Yang said softly. He did not look like someone who had been possessed. Instead, he looked like an older brother next door who tried to persuade an unruly younger brother.

“That place, we used to catch fish there.

“That mountain, we stole sweet potatoes there and was chased far away.

“Master gave a dao lecture to us on Mount Cloud Dream. At that time, he was only at the Reversion Void Stage. He once asked us what our dreams were. Our goals were similar, to stand at the peak.”

Chen Shuang paused and said, “Protect the people around us.”

“The realm of the Dao is like a child growing up, stage by stage. When we reach our level, these things become shackles. Junior Brother, don’t stop me. You can’t stop me.”

Amidst the dark clouds covering the sky, a dark cloud suddenly drifted down.

It turned everyone in the area into dust. Zi Yang raised his head and looked at his body. The sound of the chains breaking caused his internal qi to be released again.

“Sect Master, please release the barrier.”

Chen Shuang chuckled and placed his hands in front of him.

The barrier of the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect suddenly opened.

“How can I reject the calls to join hands to fight against the enemy? I’m afraid it’s more painful than death to watch my fellow disciples die.”

“Putting the sect master’s mortal body in danger, even if it’s the feelings of fellow sect members, it’s still heartless. The ruthlessness of Dao is the true feeling.”

Zi Yang’s body turned hazy, and his body split into two.

One of the bodies once again left the area where Chen Shuang was fighting.

“Senior brother, I will go and cut off my constraints. As for you, you can stay here…”

The current Chen Shuang, even if he split into two, was enough to stall him and make him unable to leave.
