Chapter 1112: Chapter 1,112, I’m playing you! 

The crazed look on Yun Long’s face clearly showed that he had been thoroughly enraged by Qin Yu.

He stepped on the seawater and charged towards Qin Yu once again. His palm transformed into a steel claw and headed straight for Qin Yu’s vital point!

Qin Yu, who was restricted by the seawater, slowed down a lot and was unable to dodge.

He could only slightly turn his body to Dodge Qin Yu’s vital point.

The palm was like a sharp blade, grabbing Qin Yu’s chest! Qin Yu’s chest was instantly torn open, revealing his ghastly white bones!

Fresh blood soaked in the seawater. If this continued, he might really die here!

Yun Long didn’t stop there. He held the power of ten thousand tons and once again pressed toward Qin Yu!

“Wait!”

At this critical moment, Qin Yu suddenly shouted!

Yun Long’s palm suddenly stopped.

He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “What else do you have to say!”

Qin Yu lowered his head to look at the blood on his chest and said in a low voice, “Yun Long, why did you suddenly attack me?”

“Why did I attack you? You lied to me and stole the strange flower, and you still dare to ask me? !”Yun long gnashed his teeth and said.

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and sighed. “Then you misunderstood me.”

“Misunderstanding? F * ck you!”Yun long cursed.

Qin Yu hurriedly explained, “You really misunderstood me. What reason do I have to escape? Your master is a mighty figure. Where can I escape to?”

Yun Long’s face was gloomy as he said, “Then why did you leave Cloud Dragon Island?”

Qin Yu pretended to be aggrieved as he said, “I had no choice. As you know, refining the heavenly essence pill requires a lot of herbs, not just the exotic flower.”

“The inventory in my hands is gone, so I could only leave temporarily to search for herbs. I never expected that you would misunderstand me.”

Yun long narrowed his eyes and sneered, “Kid, do you think I’m an idiot? Do you think I’ll believe your nonsense?”

“What I said is true!”Qin Yu said with sincerity.

“I really didn’t expect you to misunderstand me like this.”

Yun Long’s face was gloomy. He said coldly, “If that’s the case, why did you leave without saying goodbye?”

“I was afraid that you wouldn’t believe me! I can see that you don’t trust me at all. Touch your conscience and tell me if what I said is true!”Qin Yu shouted.

Yun Long’s expression stiffened and he snorted, “So what? You take the strange flower, and you will die. No matter what you say, I Won’t let you go today!”

Seeing this, Qin Yu could only sigh and say, “Since it’s like this, then I have nothing to say. Didn’t you come to me for the strange flower? I’ll return it to you.”

“Then don’t talk nonsense. Hand over the strange flower!”Yun Long said coldly.

Qin Yu patted his chest and said, “No problem! I’ll take you to find the Strange Flower Now!”

“Find the strange flower? What do you mean?”Yun Long said coldly.

Qin Yu pointed to the top and said, “The pressure under the sea is so great. I’m afraid to destroy the strange flower, so I hid it with a secret method. Follow me.”

With that, Qin Yu swam upwards quickly.

As long as he escaped from the sea, the restriction on Qin Yu’s strength would disappear.

At that time, a mere yun long would not be worth mentioning!

Yun Long was not worried. The fight between the two just now had already determined who was superior.

In his opinion, this Qin Yu was not worth mentioning at all.

He followed behind Qin Yu and swam towards the surface of the sea.

Soon, Qin Yu arrived at the surface of the sea.

He stepped on the surface of the sea and panted heavily.

“Damn it, I almost rolled over,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Soon, Yun Long’s figure followed closely behind him and burst out from under the surface of the sea.

“Where’s the strange flower?”Yun long asked with a cold face.

Qin Yu was not in a hurry to answer. Instead, he closed his eyes slightly and slowly healed his internal qi and adjusted his breathing.

“I’m asking you about the strange flower!”Yun long roared like a thunder, shaking the entire surface of the sea!

Qin Yu pointed at his stomach and said, “It’s in my stomach.”

“What? !”Yun Long’s expression changed and he said coldly, “What do you mean?”

Qin Yu said with a smile, “I ate it. I’m afraid I Can’t return the complete strange flower to you. If you really want it, you can wait. You can bring it back when I pull it out.”

“My digestion isn’t very good. I think it can still have some medicinal effect. It should be useful after eating it.”

When Yun long heard this, the veins on his forehead immediately bulged.

Because of his anger, his entire body was almost trembling. A terrifying killing intent swept across the entire sea surface. Countless innocent fish were directly shaken into a bloody mist!

“Kid, you tricked me again!”Yun long roared angrily. In an instant, the color of the sky changed!

Qin Yu sneered, “That’s right, I was just fooling you. Who asked you to be so stupid?”

“Ah! ! !”

Yun long raised his head and roared angrily. His angry roar spread over a hundred meters away! The rolling sound was so loud that it made people’s ears hurt!

“Kid, you have fooled me again and again. I will tear you into pieces! ! !”Yun Long’s eyes were wide open and bloodshot.

The next second, he stepped on the surface of the sea and charged at Qin Yu again!

Qin Yu’s lips curled into a cold smile. His body was covered in golden light. He clenched his fist and took a step forward. His golden fist was like a chariot, smashing towards Yun long with a loud bang!

The moment the two fists collided, the seawater instantly exploded hundreds of meters! Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The terrifying residual power was like water ripples. With the two of them as the center, it spread rapidly in all directions!

A huge puddle suddenly appeared on the surface of the entire sea. At this moment, even the drops of water had an unimaginable power!

The sea water exploded, and the temperature under their feet soared rapidly, as if it was boiling!
