Chapter 595: Bewitching Power! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Just as Qin Yu had said, as long as the power was strong enough, it could sweep away everything!

Ever since Qin Yu stepped into the Martial Marquis realm, his strength had exceeded one’s imagination and he could crush those of the same level!

Although He Teng’s move was somewhat strange, in the face of absolute strength, it wasn’t worth mentioning at all!

Blue veins bulged on Qin Yu’s arm, and all of his spiritual power gathered at one point!

He Teng snorted coldly. He raised his finger, and that strange black energy once again swept towards Qin Yu!

“Using softness to counter hardness? I only believe in absolute strength! ”

Along with Qin Yu’s explosive shout, the light on his fist instantly turned incandescent!

The instant that black energy touched, it once again unleashed its soft power while wrapping around Qin Yu.

However, this time, it was unable to stop Qin Yu’s attack!

That ball of black energy was blasted apart!

He Teng’s expression changed, and he immediately took a few steps back!

His face turned pale, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer. It looked like this ball of strange energy was inextricably linked to one’s main body.

He Teng’s expression was somewhat unsightly. He had never thought that Qin Yu could use tough moves to counter softness!

Yan Jinyao, Yao Meng, and the others were also watching this scene.

“I’ve heard of He Teng. He has some strength,” Zhuang Teng said.

Chu Heng also said, “When he stepped into the half-step Martial Marquis realm, I was still at the peak of the Grandmaster realm.”

Then, the two looked at Yan Jinyao and said “Mr. Yan, who do you think will win?”

Yan Jinyao snorted lightly and said “It doesn’t matter who wins and who loses, but those who survive might have the qualifications to fight with me. ”

His words were extremely arrogant! It was as if Qin Yu and He Teng were fighting for the right to fight with him!

“Mr. Yan’s words make sense. No matter who it is, I’m afraid they aren’t Mr. Yan’s match. ” A few of them couldn’t help but laugh.

He Teng wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and looked coldly at Qin Yu.

“If this is your ability, you will definitely die today.” Qin Yu said coldly.

“I know you have a Spatial Magic Artifact, but today... don’t even think about escaping!”

Qin Yu roared angrily. His internal qi exploded, and with his feet as the center, rays of golden light spread out in all directions!

After that, the light enveloped Qin Yu and He Teng, as if it had split open a small world!

“Qin Yu has actually comprehended a spatial spell? ” Someone not far away exclaimed in surprise.

“This guy is really surprising.”

He Teng’s expression was gloomy as he sneered. You’ve underestimated this power of mine. Do you think that it can only use softness to counter hardness? Then you’re gravely mistaken! ”

He Teng let out an angry roar as the black energy surrounding him once again rushed towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu sneered. “I thought there was some new trick, but it turns out it’s just the same old trick. It’s not worth mentioning! ”

With that said, Qin Yu’s golden light suddenly appeared and he threw a punch!

Just as the two rays of light were about to collide, the black energy suddenly transformed into a human face!

And this human face was none other than Yan Ruoxue’s face!

“Ruoxue! Ruoxue!” Qin Yu was instantly in a daze, and his fist instantly lost its color!

That was the woman he loved. How could Qin Yu make a move?

“You’ve been tricked!” He Teng shouted loudly!

That force rapidly transformed into a fierce fist before smashing onto Qin Yu’s chest fiercely!

“Boom!”

This punch was extremely powerful and sent Qin Yu flying!

“Qin Yu!” When the crowd saw this, they couldn’t help but shout!

Qin Yu stood up from the ground and looked at his chest. This punch didn’t cause any substantial damage to him.

Hehe, Qin Yu, just a woman can make you lose your mind. This means that you are destined to be at the bottom forever!” He Teng said indifferently.

Qin Yu’s expression was a little ugly.

It has to be said that this move was extremely effective on Qin Yu.

Although Yan Ruoxue’s face only flashed by, it was more effective than thousands of spells!

“If you can’t even let go of a woman, how can you stand at the top?” “He Teng said coldly.”

Qin Yu didn’t say a word, but his mind was already in a mess.

His mind was filled with Yan Ruoxue’s face, and his internal qi was chaotic.

If that punch had landed on that face that he had been dreaming about, how painful would that have been?

“Hehe, Yan Ruoxue is indeed his weakness.” Yan Gui couldn’t help but sneer.

This matter must be reported to the higher-ups. As long as Yan Ruoxue is still in our hands, then he won’t be able to cause any trouble! ”

The black energy on He Teng’s body began to surge again.

“Qin Yu, how are you going to get past this?” He Teng roared angrily, and that energy once again erupted towards Qin Yu! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

This time, the black energy still transformed into Yan Ruoxue’s face!

Even though Qin Yu knew that it was fake, his body didn’t listen to his commands, and he simply couldn’t do it!

Phew! ”

When that energy got close to Qin Yu, it transformed into a sharp blade before piercing through Qin Yu’s golden light and entering into his physical body!

Fresh blood flowed down his body.

“Go to h*ll!” He Teng seemed to have gone mad, and several streams of energy rained down densely on Qin Yu!

“Bang! Bang! Bang!!”

Under this force, Qin Yu was beaten back repeatedly, and his body was unable to hold on any longer!

“Hahaha! Qin Yu, so you’re just a person with no ambition! ” He Teng laughed crazily.

“Today, I will let you get rid of your pain and let you go to h*ll!”

This time, the image created by that power was even more realistic! One could even see Yan Ruoxue’s pitiful look!

Qin Yu stared blankly at “Yan Ruoxue”. He reached out his hand and whispered. “Ruoxue... I am useless. I couldn’t save you...”

“F*ck it!”

Just as Qin Yu was in a daze, a scarlet light smashed down!

“Boom!”

Under this punch, the black energy ball exploded, and “Yan Ruoxue” also disappeared.

Chang Mang glared at Qin Yu angrily and shouted. “Qin Yu, are you f*cking retarded? This is a fake! ”

He shook Qin Yu’s body with a furious expression.

Qin Yu’s absent-minded eyes slowly regained their focus.

He rubbed his eyes and frowned. “I just seemed to have been bewitched.”

That black energy seemed to have disturbed Qin Yu’s divine sense and made Qin Yu lose his fighting spirit.

If it was just a fake face, Qin Yu definitely wouldn’t be affected so much!

He Teng narrowed his eyes and snorted. “You actually saw through it!”

“Hehe, that’s right. As long as you fell for it the first time, you would be endlessly bewitched, but unfortunately, it was broken by this b*stard! ”
