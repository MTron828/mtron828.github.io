Chapter 1620: Chapter 1,620, Tianyun sect master’s News 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Seeing that they were about to quarrel again, Qin Yu hurriedly stood between them.

He looked at the deputy sect master and said, “Deputy sect master, don’t worry. If there’s really danger, I definitely won’t use the purple-red Heaven Fire.”

Even though that was the case, with Qin Yu’s character, as long as there was a one in ten thousand chance, he would try.

“Alright, now that everyone understands the situation in the northern lands, let’s do our own things,”Qin Yu said.

The deputy sect master did not say anything more and could only nod in agreement.

As for whether they could find the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect, that was probably an unknown.

After parting ways, Qin Yu followed Wen Wanye and rushed towards the great Yue mountain.

After arriving at the great Yue Mountain, Wen Wanye looked at Qin Yu and said, “What plans do you have?”

Qin Yu glanced at Wen Wanyun and said in a deep voice, “To resist the northern lands, it’s definitely not something that one or two people can do. Moreover, with the current state of the world, everyone must have the ability to protect themselves.”

“Therefore, I plan to refine a batch of pills and distribute them.”

Wen wanyun cried out in alarm, “Pill? What Pill?”

“Beast Spirit Pill.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

Originally, this Beast Spirit Pill was intended to be used by the cultivators at the northern border to resist the northern lands. But now, the situation had changed. The entire southern region was probably going to fall. Qin Yu could only try to refine as many beast spirit pills as possible.

“Qin Yu, do you know how many people there are in the Southern Region? It’s impossible for you to give everyone a pill,”Wen Wanyi said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I understand. That’s why we have to select from among them. In any war, there will always be the strong and the weak. We only need to distribute the pill to the strong and let the strong protect the weak.”

Wen wanyun frowned and said, “That’s not a small number either.”

“We can only try our best.”Qin Yu sighed.

After experiencing this matter, presumably, the northern lands would not make any moves for a while.

As long as the three godly monarchs did not come, the others would not be much of a threat.

And the existence of iron egg would definitely make the three godly monarchs extremely fearful. As such, the Southern Region still had a certain amount of time to prepare.

“Alright, I won’t waste any more time. Master, if there’s anything, please wake me up as soon as possible,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Wen wanyi sighed, “You really have the guts to think of refining a pill for everyone in the world.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He stood at the top of the Great Yue Mountain, took out ye Nan’s stock of herbs from the spatial magic artifact, and then began to refine the Beast Spirit Pill.

This was definitely an extremely huge project. Even Qin Yu needed to waste a large amount of energy and physical strength, so he had to be fully focused and not be distracted.

Along with the input of the herbs and the leap of the spiritual fire, pill after pill began to take shape.

It had to be said that Qin Yu’s speed of comprehending pills was extremely fast. He was not familiar with this beast spirit pill, but he had refined more than ten beast spirit pills in one go! And these more than ten Beast Spirit Pill, Qin Yu only used three days!

Such a speed, if the person from the central plains saw it, he would definitely be greatly shocked!

But even so, Qin Yu was not the slightest bit satisfied.

He looked at the pill in front of him and said in a low voice, “It’s too slow. At this speed, I’m simply unable to refine a large number of pills...”

But the current Qin Yu did not have anyone to ask for help. He could only try to increase his speed.

Day after day passed, and the number of pill in front of Qin Yu also began to increase.

In half a month’s time, there were already nearly a hundred beast spirit pills in front of Qin Yu!

And at this time, Qin Yu was almost exhausted.

His face was pale, his lips were purple, and his forehead was sweating non-stop. This was clearly the result of excessive divine sense!

When Wen Wanyi saw this scene, he couldn’t help but feel anxious and angry.

“Damn it, for the sake of these B * stards, is this kid going to risk his life? !”Wen Wanyi couldn’t help but blow his beard and glare.

He walked around Qin Yu, the more he thought about it, the angrier he got.

“The most important thing is, these B * stards might not even appreciate my kindness. F * ck them!”Wen wanyi held back his anger, afraid of alerting Qin Yu.

After thinking about it, Wen Wanyi turned around and left the great Yue mountain. He did not know where he went.

On the other side.

The deputy sect master was also looking for traces of the sect master.

He knew that the sect master liked to go to a few places, but after searching for a while, he didn’t find any traces of the sect master.

In the meeting hall.

The vice sect master and the Elders’faces were as dark as water, and they all kept quiet.

“With the sect master’s methods, if he wants to hide, no one in this world can find him,”an elder said.

“That’s right, we’ve searched everywhere we can, but we still haven’t found him.”

“If we really can’t find him, we can only give up.”

“Perhaps the first elder knows where the sect master is, but unfortunately, the first elder is already dead.”

At the mention of the first elder, the vice sect master’s eyes lit up, as if he had thought of something.

He suddenly stood up and said with some excitement, “There’s still one place we haven’t been to!”

“What Place?”Everyone’s gaze fell on the vice sect master.

The vice sect master narrowed his eyes and said, “Laiqu Lake.”

“Laiqu Lake?”Everyone looked at each other, as if they were extremely unfamiliar with this place.

The vice sect master glanced at everyone, and then slowly said, “You shouldn’t know this place. Laiqu Lake is the sect master’s hometown, as well as the first elder’s hometown.”

When these words were said, everyone was shocked!

What? The first elder and the sect master actually came from the same place?

No wonder the sect master trusted and valued the first elder so much. There must be an unclear relationship between the two!

“I’ll leave now and head to the Laiqu Lake,”the deputy sect master said in a deep voice.

“I’ll go with you!”Di Zun quickly stood up and said.

The deputy sect master glanced at Di Zun and shook his head, “No, you can’t go. If anything happens on the way, I can’t explain it.”

“But...”

“There’s no buts,”the deputy sect master interrupted Di Zun.

He glanced at the crowd and said in a deep voice, “Before I come back, no one is allowed to act recklessly.”

That day, the deputy sect master left the Heavenly Cloud sect and went straight to the Laiqu Pond.

Laiqu Pond.

This was a rather remote village, and this place had long been deserted. Rumor has it that in a great war, the Laiqu Pond was destroyed, and only the sect master and first elder were left alive.

In the center of the Laiqu Pond was a pond. This pond didn’t have any spiritual Qi, and was just an ordinary mountain spring. That was why the Laiqu Pond got its name. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Beside the Laiqu Pond sat a slender man. He wore a long white robe and had a head of long hair like a waterfall. He looked like an immortal.

This person was none other than the sect master of the Tianyun sect.

At this moment, the sect master was sitting cross-legged with his eyes closed, as if he was cultivating.
