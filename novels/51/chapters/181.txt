Wei Jiang forced a smile and said. “The Jiang family’s power in Chuzhou is beyond your imagination.”

“That’s right.” Wei Ming also nodded.

“Jiang Haoran’s father had already dominated Chuzhou ten years ago, and they are a prominent family that has been established for many years.”

“Three years ago, Jiang Haoran’s father went into seclusion. Rumor had it that he wanted to break through to become an Inner Strength Grandmaster. Once he comes out of seclusion, Qin Yu, I’m afraid you will be in trouble.” Wei Ming said.

“Inner Strength Grandmaster...” Qin Yu muttered softly.

That was the same level as Yan Jiang. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

With Qin Yu’s current strength, if he met Yan Jiang, he wouldn’t be able to fight back at all.

“Inner Strength Grandmasters are a little troublesome.” Qin Yu rubbed his forehead.

But since things had already come to this, Qin Yu had no way out.

Thinking of the text message from Yan Ruoxue, Qin Yu felt invigorated.

Then, Qin Yu drove Wei Jiang and Wei Ming home.

Halfway there, the surrounding temperature suddenly began to drop.

It was early autumn, but it felt like winter.

“It’s so cold.” Wei Jiang couldn’t help but shiver.

Updates by

Even Wei Ming, a martial artist, felt a chill.

“What goes around comes around.” Qin Yu parked the car at the side.

He saw Qiu Feng standing in front.

He had his hands behind his back and his eyes closed. He looked no different from an ordinary old man.

However, the murderous aura on his body was immensely strong!

“As expected, he is waiting for me here.” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes.

“Mr. Qiu? Why is he here?” Wei Jiang couldn’t help but frown.

Qin Yu didn’t pay attention to him. Not only did he not brake, but he stepped on the accelerator and crashed into Qiu Feng!

Wei Jiang, who was in the car, immediately panicked. He said anxiously. “Qin Yu, what are you doing?! Stop the car quickly!”

However, Qin Yu was unfazed at all. The car sped towards Qiu Feng!

“Qin Yu, are you crazy?! Qiu Feng is my good friend. Are you going to kill him for this?!” Wei Jiang shouted anxiously!

Qin Yu ignored him. Finally, the car crashed towards Qiu Feng fiercely!

“Clang!”

The car came to an abrupt stop!

The huge collision even caused the airbag on the car to burst out!

Qin Yu saw Qiu Feng lifting his hand and pressing it on the front of the car!

The front of the car was flattened, but Qiu Feng was safe and sound!

“How... How is this possible?!” Wei Jiang ignored the pain on his forehead and looked at Qiu Feng in horror!

Qin Yu glanced at Wei Jiang and said coldly. “I said, this Qiu Feng is probably not the Qiu Feng you know.”

Wei Jiang wanted to say something, but was stopped by Qin Yu.

“You guys stay in the car. No matter what happens, don’t get out,” Qin Yu said.

At this time, Wei Ming also realized that something was wrong.

He hurriedly said. “Mr. Qin, I’ll get out with you.”

“No need.” Qin Yu waved his hand.

“With your strength, getting out of the car will only drag me down.”

Wei Ming was stunned, but then he couldn’t help but force a smile.

He didn’t know when it started, but he was no longer on the same level as Qin Yu.

After getting out of the car, Qin Yu looked at Qiu Feng.

“You must have been waiting for a long time.” Qin Yu looked at Qiu Feng quietly.

Qiu Feng put his hands behind his back and said indifferently. “Hand over the bronze sword and the stone statue, and I’ll spare your life.”

“Spare my life?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows. “With this body?”

Shock flashed in Qiu Feng’s eyes, and then he laughed. “I really underestimated you. I didn’t expect you to be able to tell!”

“Tell me, who are you?” Qin Yu asked coldly.

“Also, where did the original Qiu Feng go?”

Qiu Feng squinted his eyes and said. “You’re just a man on the brink of death, so do I need to tell you?”

“Is that so?” Qin Yu’s expression turned cold, and an intense internal qi burst out from his body!

The surrounding sand and stones were instantly swept away, and even the surrounding trees shook!

However, Qiu Feng’s expression was calm, and he was unfazed at all.

“A mere Inner Strength Master Hands dares to cross me.” Qiu Feng said coldly.

“When I was making a living for myself, you were just a kid!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Qiu Feng grabbed towards Qin Yu!

His fingers were covered with black fog, and in an instant, his fingers became as tough as a dagger!

“Just in time for me to use you to test my body.” Qin Yu raised his fist and met it head-on!

“You’re too big for your britches!” Qiu Feng’s expression turned cold. His finger suddenly transformed into a palm and he grabbed Qin Yu’s fist!

Following that, black mist emanated from Qiu Feng’s palm. This black mist flowed along Qin Yu’s arm and seemed to spread throughout his entire body!

“Huh?” Qin Yu suddenly felt a chill all over his body! His body was unable to move at all!

Qiu Feng sneered. “Ignorant child, this is dark energy. It can suppress all inner strength! Once it is enveloped by the dark energy in my body, your inner strength will be crippled! At that time, you will become a cripple!”

“As I guessed!” Qin Yu’s expression turned cold.

“You’re from a certain sect in the southwest, right?” Qin Yu questioned coldly.

Qiu Feng laughed out loud. “You really know quite a lot! It’s a pity that you’re going to die soon!”

After saying that, the dark energy on Qiu Feng’s body surged and almost enveloped Qin Yu’s entire body!

“Go to h*ll!” A deranged look flashed across Qiu Feng’s eyes. The dark energy all over his body surged, as if it wanted to swallow Qin Yu’s body!

However, at this moment, the black energy that lingered around Qin Yu’s body started to disappear bit by bit!

Qiu Feng’s pupils dilated and he frowned. “What’s going on?”

Qiu Feng, who didn’t know what was going on, immediately released the dark energy again!

However, after the dark energy spread for a moment, it started to disappear again!

“Huh?”

At this moment, Qiu Feng’s expression suddenly changed!

He was shocked to find that Qin Yu’s body was actively absorbing the dark energy!

“How is this possible?!” Qiu Feng’s expression changed drastically. He hurriedly released his hand and retreated backward!

The dark energy around Qin Yu slowly disappeared and was completely absorbed by Qin Yu’s body!

“Awesome!” Qin Yu opened his eyes and couldn’t help but let out a breath of relief!

Then, Qin Yu looked at Qiu Feng and sneered. “Thank you for your selfless gift. In order to express my gratitude, I will let you die a quick death.”

Qiu Feng’s expression was a bit ugly. He looked at Qin Yu coldly. “You actually rely on dark energy to cultivate? Who exactly are you?”

Qin Yu shook his head and sneered. “I can’t only rely on dark energy to cultivate, but I can also rely on spiritual energy and inner strength to cultivate. You didn’t expect that, did you?”

When he heard this, Qiu Feng’s expression changed drastically!

“You... you’re a chaotic body?” Qiu Feng shouted in shock!

“Chaotic body?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and asked in surprise. “What is that?”

Qiu Feng, his face full of shock, ignored Qin Yu and stared at him!

“Kid, if you can’t be used by me, I must kill you. Otherwise, no one will be able to stop you in the future!” Qiu Feng was brimming with dark energy, and his eyes were full of killing intent!

Qin Yu frowned and said. “You haven’t answered me. What is a chaotic body?”

“You don’t have the chance to know. Go to H*ll and ask Satan!” Qiu Feng shouted crazily!
