Chapter 694: The Mystic Realm of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The old woman seemed to have noticed something. She stretched out her shriveled hand to grab Qin Yu’s head!

This old woman had extremely tyrannical strength. It was obvious that she had stepped into the peak of Martial Marquis. Even Qin Yu did not dare to neglect her!

Without thinking, he took out the Prajna ruler and slapped over.

“Boom!”

A wisp of Martial Saint’s internal qi instantly exploded on the old woman’s palm!

“Ah!!”

Its power directly pierced through the old woman’s palm, and fresh blood instantly stained her long robe.

“Tsk, tsk, the Martial Saint Weapon really lives up to its reputation,” Qin Yu shook the Prajna ruler in his hand and sneered coldly.

The old woman narrowed her eyes and said coldly, “Qu Xie’s Prajna ruler had actually fallen into your hands...”

“It seems that you are not well-informed,” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

The old woman was indeed not well-informed. Strictly speaking, she didn’t even belong to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association but was only an honored guest.

However, she had a secret connection with the higher-ups of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, which resulted in her high status. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Old Thing, do you want to try the power of this Prajna ruler again?” Qin Yu shook the Prajna ruler and sneered.

A strand of internal qi followed Qin Yu’s palm and entered the Prajna ruler.

The Prajna ruler instantly flashed with several dark and mysterious lights.

The old woman’s expression changed, and her body unconsciously took a step back.

Obviously, this old thing was also afraid of the Prajna ruler. After all, it was a Martial Saint Weapon.

Both sides were in a stalemate, and neither of them dared to make the first move.

“Dong!”

At this moment, Burly, who was tied up by the Heaven Swallowing Python suddenly attacked!

He clenched his hand and suddenly punched the head of the Heaven Swallowing Python!

This punch was so powerful that it almost shattered the space!

The head of the Heaven Swallowing Python flew out directly. Fresh blood flowed down from the head of the python!

The old woman’s expression changed drastically when she saw this!

“My Heaven Swallowing Python!” the old woman screamed and ran towards the python!

The strength of Burly’s punch was so great that the Heaven Swallowing Python almost fainted!

“As expected of a top-grade demonic beast. This punch didn’t break its head,” Qin Yu sneered.

The old woman hugged the huge head of the Heaven Swallowing Python with a sorrowful expression.

“You dare to hurt my Heaven Swallowing Python, I will definitely not spare you!” the old woman screamed shrilly.

Qin Yu sneered, “Burly, peel off the skin of this Heaven Swallowing Python. I want to make a cloak!”

Receiving the order, Burly took another step towards the Heaven-Swallowing Python!

The old woman’s expression changed drastically. She hurriedly took out her magic artifact in an attempt to stop Burly.

However, all of her magic artifacts were nothing in front of Burly!

With a punch, the magic artifact exploded like glass!

“Boom!”

Finally, Burly’s fist smashed onto the huge head of the Heaven Swallowing Python!

With this punch, cracks immediately appeared on the head of the python!

“My Heaven Swallowing Python!” the old woman’s eyes were wide open and her face was filled with anger!

Burly did not stop what he was doing. He clenched his fist and prepared to throw a third punch!

At this moment, the old woman hurriedly put away the Heaven Swallowing Python.

Then, the old woman stared at Qin Yu and said, “You hurt my Heaven Swallowing Python, I will definitely kill you! Qin Yu, from now on, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association will no longer have any negotiating talk with you!”

“D*mn it! If you don’t send Yan Ruoxue back to me, what is there to talk about between us?” Qin Yu said coldly.

The old woman’s eyes were filled with killing intent, and she hated Qin Yu to the bone.

“Burly, do it,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The old woman gritted her teeth. She took out a magic artifact and slowly disappeared.

“Spatial Magic Artifact again?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Qin Yu had seen Spatial Magic Artifacts several times, but he had never owned one.

“Qin Yu, it’s the time of your death!” the old woman’s voice came from all directions!

Qin Yu sneered, “I’ll wait for you!”

As the old woman disappeared, Qin Yu’s mind gradually calmed down.

“It seems that Yan Ruoxue is very important to Jingdu Martial Arts Association,” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

Even if Qin Yu kidnapped Qu Xie, they still didn’t plan to let her go.

“I have to find out Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s intention as soon as possible,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Once Qu Xie was killed, there would be no turning back. The Jingdu Martial Arts Association would not let go of it!

...

At this time, the old woman had rushed back to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

In the depths of the association, there was another door.

This door looked extremely mysterious and unfathomable.

Most importantly, ordinary people were not qualified to enter the door. Even Qu Xie did not know what was behind the door.

At this moment, the old woman stood in front of the door, folded her hands, and silently chanted a spell.

A moment later, the door slowly opened.

What was surprising was that behind the door was a paradise! It was completely different from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s concrete jungle!

Stepping into it, one could smell the dense spiritual energy and the fragrance of flowers.

A small world was behind this door! A small world that was isolated from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!

Such a method was really shocking!

It was said that only the Mighty Realm cultivators could open up a small world on their own!

Could it be that Jingdu Martial Arts Association had Mighty Realm cultivators?

It was unimaginable!

The old woman walked into this small world with a gloomy face.

Then, the door slowly closed.

In one of the manors in this small world, the old woman released the Heaven Swallowing Python.

The Heaven Swallowing Python was bleeding profusely, and its life and death were unknown.

The huge snake’s head was heavily stained with blood. It was terrifying to look at.

“My Heaven Swallowing Python...” the old woman caressed its head, and muddy tears flowed out of her sunken eye sockets.

“How is it going?”

At this moment, a voice came from behind the old woman.

She turned around and saw a man in a black robe with his face covered.

The old woman gritted her teeth and said with a vicious expression, “I want to kill that Qin Yu! He hurt my Heaven Swallowing Python. I must kill him!”

When the man heard this, he could not help but say, “This Heaven Swallowing Python is at the peak of Martial Marquis. Other than the Martial Saint, no one can defeat it. How could that Qin Yu injure the Heaven Swallowing Python to such a state?”

The old woman wiped her tears and said coldly, “There are two experts by Qin Yu’s side. From their physical strength, they should be at least at the Mighty Realm.”

“Mighty Realm?” the man’s expression instantly changed drastically when he heard this!

“How can there be a cultivator at the Mighty Realm in this world?!” the man frowned and said.

The old woman said in a deep voice, “Don’t be anxious. According to my observations, they are only two corpses. They are at least thousands of years old.

“I don’t know what secret technique Qin Yu had used to temporarily control these two corpses.”

The man was silent for a moment before sneering, “He actually managed to obtain the physical bodies of the Mighty Realm... What a surprise!”

The old woman gnashed her teeth and said, “Those two corpses won’t be able to survive for long. As soon as the time comes, I’ll immediately kill that Qin Yu with my own hands!”
