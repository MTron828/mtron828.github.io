1843 Take Action

Chang Mang’s words had indeed moved Qin Yu.

Perhaps, only true brothers would say such words.

Qin Yu didn’t stay any longer. He quickly left the Demon-slaying Peak and rushed toward the first main peak.

When he arrived at the first main peak, Dean Lei seemed to have guessed Qin Yu’s purpose of coming.

He had sent people to wait for Qin Yu outside. Seeing Qin Yu walking over, the two men immediately came forward.

!!

“Greetings, Seniors.” Qin Yu bowed slightly.

“Qin Yu, you’re here to exchange for a Saint Weapon,” one of them said.

Qin Yu was not too surprised. After all, it was too easy for someone like Dean Lei to figure out Qin Yu’s mind.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes.”

“Come with us,” the two of them said.

Following that, Qin Yu followed them into the spatial formation.

After a moment of dizziness, they arrived at Thunder Courtyard.

This time, the two of them personally led Qin Yu and headed upstairs.

The two of them stopped when they reached the fifth floor. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Qin Yu had now stepped into the Reversion Void Stage, so he was naturally entitled to enter the fifth floor.

The two of them waved their hands, and a brilliant light flashed. Following that, the door slowly opened.

The moment the door opened, Qin Yu felt a trace of Holy Power rush toward his face.

There were even more advanced cultivation techniques on the fifth floor. There were also real awakened Saint Weapons.

“You can’t stay for too long. You have to hurry,” the two men reminded him.

“I understand,” Qin Yu bowed and said.

After stepping onto the fifth floor, Qin Yu was not in the mood to look for other cultivation techniques. Instead, he had a clear goal and went straight for the Saint Weapon.

In the depths of the fifth floor, there was a secret compartment. After opening it, the Saint Weapons inside slowly leaked out.

What surprised Qin Yu was that these Saint Weapons were quite far away from each other, and each had completely awakened. They were extremely terrifying.

Even though these Saint Weapons were not in use, the terrifying internal qi they emitted still made people feel the powerful oppression.

Qin Yu’s eyes swept around and saw eight Saint weapons.

These magical artifacts were all different. There were a bronze mirror, an ancient bell, a cloud drum, and a sacred bell.

Qin Yu was only a Reversion Void Stage cultivator, so he could not pry into the secrets of these Saint Weapons. He could only choose a Saint Weapon based on his feelings.

In the end, Qin Yu chose a magic ruler and held it in his hand.

This magic ruler was only an inch long, but the Holy Power emitted was extremely terrifying.

The magic ruler required a total of 1,200 points. And it could only be used for a short month.

1,200 points in exchange for a month’s right to use was definitely not a good deal.

It was also due to this that no one was willing to take out their points.

After getting the magic ruler, Qin Yu turned around and left the fifth floor.

Looking at the magic ruler in Qin Yu’s hand, the two seniors who had come along with him could not help but be surprised.

“Why did you choose this magic ruler? The points required for this magic ruler… were quite a fair bit,” the two men said.

“I have to guarantee I can win,” said Qin Yu in a deep voice.

After all, Qin Yu’s goal was not just Li Yingying but the entire Tong family!

The moment they touched Jue Wu, they were already sentenced to death by Qin Yu in his heart.

Seeing this, the two men didn’t say anything else. They just nodded and said, “Let’s go.”

Therefore, Qin Yu followed the two of them and left Thunder Courtyard.

After returning to the first main peak, Qin Yu bowed to the two seniors and said, “Thank you for your guidance, Seniors. Please also thank Dean Lei on my behalf.”

After saying that, Qin Yu did not stay any longer. He immediately got up and left the first main peak, heading straight for Nanzhou.

This was Qin Yu’s first battle after stepping into the Reversion Void Stage. It was also a moment he witnessed his strength.

The moment Qin Yu stepped out of Thunder Courtyard, he was soon noticed.

The Tong family didn’t give up. In addition to using Jue Wu to lure Qin Yu, they also deployed people around Thunder Courtyard.

As soon as Qin Yu appeared, they could detect him in first instance.

At this moment, Qin Yu was rushing toward Nanzhou. The two Reversion Void Stage cultivators from the Tong family quickly followed him.

Qin Yu, running at full speed, soon sensed the two powerful internal qi behind him.

He squinted his eyes and slowed down his pace.

A few minutes later.

Two middle-aged men appeared in front of Qin Yu.

There were traces of weirdness and coldness on their faces. In their eyes, there were even traces of hatred.

“Qin Yu, you’ve finally shown up!” the two men stepped forward and shouted.

“Because of you, we have been waiting in Thunder Courtyard for eight months! Do you know how we’ve been through the past eight months?”

Upon hearing their shouts, Qin Yu’s face turned cold.

He slowly turned around, and his pair of cold eyes exuded a strong killing intent.

“Jue Wu… Were you the ones who took her away?” Qin Yu said coldly.

The two of them were stunned for a moment. They then sneered and said, “Does it make any difference? Your last hour has come, yet you still care about others?”

“Qin Yu, don’t worry. We’re bringing you to see her now,” the other man said in a sinister voice.

Qin Yu’s face turned cold, and he said coldly, “You people from the Tong family all deserve to die!”

Before he could finish her sentence, Qin Yu’s figure suddenly disappeared! The two of them could not even react to his terrifying speed!

In the next second, Qin Yu already appeared in front of them!

“What? How is that possible?” After realizing Qin Yu’s terrifying speed, the two men’s faces changed drastically!

One of them reacted in time and hurriedly shot back.

However, before the other man could react, Qin Yu reached out his palm and smashed his head!

This scene instantly made people gasp!

A Reversion Void Stage cultivator was killed with just a raise of a hand. What kind of power was this?

“You… You…” The other man pointed at Qin Yu with his face full of fear.

Qin Yu’s gaze was as if he was looking at a dead man.

This gaze shocked the man to the extreme. He didn’t dare to think much and took out his magical artifact directly.

This magic artifact was bestowed by the Tong family’s ancestors and was extremely terrifying. Although it was not comparable to a Saint Weapon, its power was destructive!

Streaks of light fused with the Great Dao rushed over. Everything was reduced to dust as if nothing could stop them wherever they passed!

The terrifying light was heading straight for Qin Yu, trying to suppress him.

Qin Yu’s face was cold. He looked at the lights shooting toward him and waved his hand immediately to slap over.

“Boom!”

The terrifying radiance emitted by the magical artifact dissipated directly in an instant under the palm!
