Chapter 764: The Power of a Martial Saint? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

All of Blackie’s power instantly crumbled and disintegrated.

Under this punch, a golden light instantly erupted.

Blackie’s figure shot out once again. This time, he directly smashed a mountain into pieces, and his entire body was pressed under the mountain rocks!

Everyone couldn’t help but widen their eyes!

Blackie’s incomparably dazzling light was actually neutralized by a single punch?

“So... so terrifying...”

“Qin Yu is already so powerful to such an extent. With just a single punch, he neutralized Blackie’s killing move and even sent him flying...”

Not far away, the young masters of the aristocratic families couldn’t help but be speechless.

“Qin Yu’s growth speed is a little too fast.” Zhuang Teng sighed.

“Yeah, if it was you or me, we wouldn’t be able to escape death from Blackie’s punch just now. However, Qin Yu actually resolved it so easily.” Chu Heng also sighed.

Even Yan Jinyao’s face flashed with a trace of solemnity.

He never expected that Qin Yu would almost take Blackie’s life with just two punches!

“Blackie!”

Granny Qin let out a mournful roar. Her aged figure suddenly shot towards Blackie!

At this moment, the mountain rocks were suddenly turned into ruins. Blackie stood up once again!

“Ah!!!”

Blackie’s body was covered in blood. He raised his head and roared. His eyes were wide open as anger filled his entire face.

“Qin Yu... you d*mn b*stard!” Blackie roared angrily. A terrifying airwave swept out in all directions.

Qin Yu’s feet lightly shook, and his body rose into the air.

He looked at Blackie coldly and said, “It’s already impressive that you were able to survive this punch. The body of the Heaven Swallowing Python is indeed worthy of its reputation.”

This praise made Blackie feel extremely humiliated!

As a peak Earth Rank demonic beast, its body was unparalleled in the world! Even among demonic beasts, it was at the peak!

But now, facing Qin Yu, it actually couldn’t win that easily!

“Qin Yu, I want to kill you! I must kill you!” Blackie’s mournful voice kept sounding.

Qin Yu sneered. “I’m afraid you won’t have the chance.”

Waves of golden light burst out from Qin Yu’s body as the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist slowly condensed.

His fist was incomparably dazzling, like a round sun.

Accompanied by Qin Yu’s furious roar, the golden light poured out towards Blackie!

This punch was extremely powerful!

The entire ground instantly collapsed, sand and stones flew everywhere, and the sky turned dark!

“Blackie!” Granny Qin immediately became anxious!

She suddenly stood up and had the intention to attack!

At this moment, Blackie’s body suddenly emitted a strange light.

This light contained a strange aura, and waves of internal qi spread out.

Then, Blackie rose up from the ground. He stretched out his palm and slapped at Qin Yu.

“Boom!”

At the moment of the collision, the entire ground rumbled!

The golden light that Qin Yu exploded with was actually dispersed in an instant!

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed, and he couldn’t help but frown.

“This is the power brought from the Mystic Realm?” Qin Yu thought inside.

He looked up and saw that Blackie was emitting a power that didn’t belong to him.

This power couldn’t be said to be strong, but it was extremely strange.

It was like a power that had been passed down for thousands of years.

The wounds on Blackie’s body were slowly recovering.

Spots appeared on his dark skin one after another.

“What happened?” Everyone felt puzzled for a moment.

Although they couldn’t see what exactly happened to Blackie, they could feel the abnormality on his body.

Even the man with the mustache couldn’t help but frown.

“This power isn’t right. It doesn’t belong to the Heaven Swallowing Python,” the man with the mustache said with a frown.

“What do you mean?” Xiao Yu frowned slightly.

The man with the mustache shook his head and didn’t explain.

“In the end, he still used this power.” Granny Qin couldn’t help but sigh.

This power was mysterious and unpredictable, and it came from the eight high-level officials.

However, no one knew what kind of side effects it would bring.

On the Qinggang Mountain that was already in ruins, two figures were looking at each other.

“Qin Yu, are you afraid?” Blackie asked coldly.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “Afraid? Yeah right!”

After saying that, Qin Yu’s body shot towards Blackie!

Blackie didn’t dodge and raised his fist to meet it head on!

“Boom!”

A loud sound was heard and Qin Yu’s body was directly smashed into the ground!

For a moment, everyone was dumbfounded.

Just now, Blackie was still being beaten up. In such a short period of time, why did it seem like he had changed his identity?

In midair, Blackie looked coldly in Qin Yu’s direction. He placed his hands behind his back and waited quietly for Qin Yu.

Qin Yu crawled out of the pit.

He rubbed his neck and shook his arms.

“What a terrifying power,” Qin Yu muttered softly as he shook his wrists.

The punch just now seemed weak and powerless, but the moment it touched, it was as if a bomb had exploded. It was extremely powerful.

“What’s going on with this power on his body...” Qin Yu frowned.

He took a deep breath, and his body burned with golden light again. The mark of the Divine Dragon Power lit up between his brows.

“The Divine Dragon Power is no longer of use to me.” Blackie’s eyes were filled with indifference.

Qin Yu didn’t say a word. He took a deep breath and rushed toward Blackie with big steps.

The golden fist arrived in front of Blackie in an instant.

However, Blackie’s figure disappeared in an instant. Its speed was so fast that it was almost impossible to see with the naked eye!

“Huh? This is... the wind word formula?” Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

Before Qin Yu could react, Blackie appeared in the sky above Qin Yu!

He closed his fists and smashed them fiercely towards Qin Yu! Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Boom!”

Under this tremendous force, Qin Yu’s bones were instantly broken and his body shot towards the ground!

However, before Qin Yu could land on the ground, Blackie’s figure had already arrived below Qin Yu!

He reached out his hand and grabbed Qin Yu’s thigh and neck, then his knee firmly landed on Qin Yu’s lower abdomen!

“Wah!”

Qin Yu suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood! The veins on his forehead bulged!

“Is that all you’ve got?” Blackie grabbed Qin Yu with one hand and threw a punch at his chest!

“Pfft!”

The punch was so powerful that it shattered Qin Yu’s chest!

“Where’s your confidence from just now?” Blackie said coldly.

Qin Yu’s face was extremely pale, and his internal qi was somewhat dispirited.

“This power... What’s going on...” Qin Yu roared inside!

This was the first time Qin Yu felt an impenetrable and incomparably powerful power!

“That’s not right. There’s something wrong with Blackie’s power,” the man with the mustache said with a serious expression.

“This power... is most likely from a Martial Saint!”
