2540 Undead Rest in Peace

A terrifying massive force emitted from that palm, and the treasure light derived from the Primordial Sky Concealing Mirror instantly shattered.

The shocking dark power dispersed everyone.

Qin Yu’s body slammed against a huge tree, and a hand as a withered branch pressed against his back.

A surge of deathly force swept through Qin Yu’s body. In an instant, Qin Yu felt much of the chaotic power and life force in his body being sucked by the deathly force, and it returned to the bodies of the undead behind him after sweeping through.

“You like to suck so much, do you?”

Qin Yu gently pushed Evil Eye in his hand backward, completely releasing its desire.

In an instant, the dense deathly force from the undead behind him gushed into Evil Eye like a fountain.

An enormous suction force lit up from the sword tip of Evil Eye, and the power of countless souls entered the sword uncontrollably.

Some experts’ souls even struggled violently before they reluctantly entered the sword, and the sword body trembled violently as if the souls within were struggling terribly.

This terrifying force, Qin Yu could not hold the ghostly sword even when he used the power of his six acupoints.

Nevertheless, the ghostly sword continued to absorb this terrifying soul power uncontrollably.

In just a short while, the power of the soul absorbed by Evil Eye had already exceeded the total amount of the entire battle of the Si family.

“How dare you! Soul Burning!”

Qin Yu roared in rage, completely lighting up her Evil Eye.

“Soul Ferry!”

The immense soul kingdom appeared like a colossal rolling wheel above Qin Yin’s body.

With the support of this terrifying soul power, the soul kingdom this time was more powerful than any other time, and its terrifying power even surpassed that of the God-slaying Dusk.

The soul-summoning power of the ghost realm entered Qin Yu’s body, and the dark energy surged like a tide above the soul kingdom. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Everyone’s divine sense could even see countless black chains condensed in the kingdom, emitting the internal qi of decay and death.

Countless bones and skulls were embedded on the chain, and each was a symbol of a soul corrupted by the dark power.

The kingdom emitted a terrifying suction force and sicked in nearly 30 undead around it uncontrollably.

The chain extended rapidly and wrapped around the targets’ souls.

These black chains twisted like black pythons, tightly binding the souls of these targets.

“Souls of the human race, you shouldn’t be struggling in this Misty Forest, and transcend!”

As Qin Yu’s Evil Eye stabbed, the dark chains completely shattered the souls of these 30-plus experts of the human race, allowing them to transcend utterly and no longer struggle in this Misty Forest.

This attack also saved Shen Rou and Zhang Xiang who were surrounded.

“What a terrifying soul attack technique!”

At this moment, Zhang Xiang was shocked.

The soul attack techniques were rare, to begin with, and it was even rarer to hear of a move like Qin Yu’s wide-range attack with such great power.

“Thank you for saving me.”

Shen Rou and Shen Qian, the two siblings, said softly, their eyes sparkling with surprise.

“Did you forge this sword?”

Xuan Tian’s expression changed and he suddenly asked.

“No, this is the Sword of Sin that the Ji family forged in Sky City. It ended up in my hands by chance.”

“The embryo of this sword seems to be from the ghost realm. The sword hilt and the sword treasure should be the items from the sorcerer tribe. Although its power is shocking, it is not fully under control and seems to have the possibility of backfiring on its master. You must be more careful.”

Xuan Tian stared at Evil Eye for a long time before gently reminding Qin Yu.

“Alright, thank you for your advice.”

The two people from the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect were not simple, for one had terrifying swordsmanship, while the other had an even more shocking vision that he could see through the details of Evil Eye with a glance.

Qin Yu was also a little surprised. The cultivation of Evil Eye was the Ji family’s top secret.

Even if they were to die, they dared not leak this information.

This sword was forged from the blood of the entire Great Xia Royal Family, and even the Ji family dared not provoke such a monstrous rage.

Xuan Tian had probably seen through this evil power, so Qin Yu directly told him the ins and outs.

With the foundation of the three sects, they should be able to determine roughly whether what he said was true.

“Senior Brother Xuan Tian is a disciple in name under the master of alchemy among our three sects, Zhang Daoling. If it wasn’t for the reluctance of the sect master to let the lineage pass freely, Senior Brother Xuan Tian would probably have become the successor to Martial Uncle Zhang. Giving a few pointers to ordinary people is indeed an incredible fortune.”

Zhang Xiang said smugly, as he could finally hold his head up high for once.

“Cut the crap. I’m afraid the battle just now has completely exposed us. Shen Qian, put away the Primordial Sky Concealing Mirror. All of us will head to our destination at full speed. There’s no need to continue hiding, and we must strive to find our target as soon as possible.”

Xuan Xin stepped on the Green Duckweed Sword and dashed into the depths of the dark forest like a streak of light.

The dark creatures that tried to stop them along the way turned into countless pieces of meat that fell to the ground.

“What a terrifying power! It seems that the display of Xuan Xin’s strength just now was merely the tip of the iceberg.”

Qin Yu followed behind and saw that it had only been a short while.

Several fourth-level monster beasts had already fallen under his sword. He instantly felt that this fellow’s strength was far more terrifying than he had imagined.

These four sects and four schools were indeed emperors in the dark and there were also some monstrous geniuses.

In addition to the people from the Ten Thousand Buddha Sect that he had seen before, the strength of the cultivators from the four sects and four sects seemed even more terrifying.

“Is the relationship among your three sects so good?”

Generally speaking, there would be tremendous conflicts when different sects involved different interests.

However, from Qin Yu’s observation, the two leaders from the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect were more considerate toward the other four people.

Moreover, there was not much internal scheming among these three sects, which was rare.

The nine great aristocratic families in the Holy Region previously were always scheming against each other, even when they formed an alliance. It was rare to see such harmonious relations.

“The Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect, Heavenly Divination Sect, and Divine Will Sect shared the same lineage as the Three Purities Sect. However, the subsequent internal strife in the Three Purities Sect led to the deaths of a large number of disciples. The subsequent sect masters of the three sects have learned from this painful lesson and have thus always maintained harmony as the sect’s rule.”

With Xuan Xin leading the way, the people behind did not feel any pressure. Shen Qian took this opportunity to explain the history of the four sects and four schools to Qin Yu.

“Since we’re already here, can you tell me about the mission for this trip?”

Qin Yu threw out his question. With these people’s strength, what mission were they carrying out that made them so nervous?

As soon as this question was asked, a few of them could not help but look at Xuan Tian as if waiting to see if he would answer Qin Yu’s question.

“This involves the Saint of the Mysterious Heavenly Revered Supreme of Three Purities Sect, Saint Zi Yang.”

Xuan Xin hesitated for a moment before explaining to Qin Yu.
