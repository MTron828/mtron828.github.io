1920 The Yan Family’s Bloodline and the Chaotic Body

The Yan family had countless disciples in name. It probably wouldn’t be easy for Si Shiyue to come to the Yan family to look for a disciple in name.

Now that Qin Yu had broken the rules many times in front of Xi Shiyue, it would definitely cause trouble if Yan Ruoxue continued to keep him by her side.

“Uncle Yan, you must ensure Qin Yu’s safety no matter what,” Yan Ruoxue looked at Uncle Yan and said in a deep voice.

Uncle Yan opened his mouth and then sighed lightly. He said, “Strictly speaking, I shouldn’t help you with this kind of thin …”

“In the entire Yan family, I trust you the most. You should know this in your heart.” Yan Ruoxue’s voice turned cold.

“If anything happens to Qin Yu, I won’t do anything to you, but I won’t live on either.”

Seeing Yan Ruoxue’s expression, Uncle Yan couldn’t help but tense up.

“Miss Yan, please don’t worry. I won’t let anything happen to him,” he quickly nodded and said.

“Alright. Go and make the arrangement now,” Yan Ruoxue nodded and said.

As a disciple in name of the Yan family, life was not hard and was usually leisurely. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Letting Qin Yu stay in the outer hall for the time being was a good choice.

Following that, Yan Ruoxue went to probe for information. Unfortunately, no one knew about this matter.

Yan Ruoxue only returned to Mount Donghuang in the evening.

Seeing Yan Ruoxue return, Qin Yu quickly ran over and asked anxiously, “Ruoxue, how is Chang Mang?”

Yan Ruoxue opened her mouth but hesitated for half a second before she finally said with a smile, “Don’t worry, Chang Mang is fine. When the Si family’s Holy Lord returns, I’ll help you get him out.”

“Alright!” Qin Yu nodded hard and said.

Yan Ruoxue was silent. No one knew what she was thinking.

“Qin Yu, you must not fall out with the SI family now, do you understand? With the Si family’s strength, getting rid of you is as easy as blowing off dust,” Yan Ruoxue furrowed her brows tightly and worriedly said.

“It’s not Earth here. I can’t guarantee your safety. So you…”

“Don’t worry,” Qin Yu interrupted Yan Ruoxue.

“I’m not that stupid,” he said with a smile. “Moreover, I don’t think the Si family would touch a junior, right?”

“That might not be the case.” Yan Ruoxue shook her head.

Qin Yu couldn’t care less at all. He had already thought of a countermeasure today.

When Qin Yu was still on Earth, he was surrounded by enemies and faced life-and-death crises everywhere, but he still survived.

What did Qin Yu rely on? It was stirring up! At that time, the Han family had been too embarrassed to make a move on Qin Yu!

It was the same logic now! Qin Yu had a chaotic body, and so did Si Shiyue.

As long as Qin Yu stirred up a little, the Si family definitely could not touch him.

The most important thing for these aristocratic families was their so-called reputation.

If they attacked Qin Yu now, wouldn’t that be announcing to the world that Si Shiyue was afraid of the growth of the other chaotic body?

Of course, Qin Yu didn’t tell Yan Ruoxue about this, and he didn’t plan to do so for the time being.

Qin Yu didn’t want to fall out with Si Shiyue for the time being unless he had no choice.

“Oh yes, you should go to the outer hall for the time being,” Yan Ruoxue said.

Qin Yu was stunned, but he didn’t ask further. He smiled and said, “Alright. But I won’t stay at the Yan family for too long.”

Yan Ruoxue didn’t ask further either and agreed, “Alright.”

That night.

Yan Ruoxue brought Qin Yu to a canyon on Mount Donghuang.

This canyon was quite strange. A magical artifact was suspended in the air, and a strange light was flashing below.

After stepping into the canyon, the surroundings immediately fell into silence as if they were isolated.

Qin Yu looked around and said with puzzle, “Ruoxue, why did you bring me here?”

Yan Ruoxue stood at the front. A look of struggle flashed across her face as if she was making a difficult decision.

“What’s wrong?” Qin Yu was even more curious.

Yan Ruoxue said in a low voice, “Qin Yu, I’m going to pass on to you a cultivation technique. It is a secret technique of the Yan family. It has never been taught to outsiders. Even the Yan family’s disciples are not qualified to comprehend it. I’m going to pass it on to you now. However, you must not use it unless it’s at a critical moment.”

Qin Yu’s expression couldn’t help but change. Of course, he knew what the secret techniques of the nine great aristocratic families meant.

Even the Yan family’s personal disciples might not be qualified to comprehend this secret technique. Yet Yan Ruoxue wanted to pass on to him now.

Once this news got out, it would bring Yan Ruoxue big trouble.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu smiled and said, “There’s no need to do this. I have my own means of self-protection.”

“Listen to me,” Yan Ruoxue touched Qin Yu’s forehead and said. “It can at least save your life. But remember, you must not use it unless it’s at a critical moment. If the Yan family finds out about this, they will definitely do everything they can to get rid of you. This secret technique cannot be taught to outsiders.”

Seeing how insistent Yan Ruoxue was, Qin Yu had no choice but to agree.

Thus he sat down cross-legged and waited for Yan Ruoxue to pass on the technique.

Traces of light floated out from Yan Ruoxue’s glabella and entered Qin Yu’s forehead.

The light flashed across as if it had been imprinted in Qin Yu’s mind.

Qin Yu had obtained the secret technique but it would take a long time to comprehend it.

“This secret technique is known as the Destiny Reincarnation Technique. It has a total of nine reincarnation techniques,” Yan Ruoxue said.

“In other words, this technique can forcibly save your life nine times. Every time you are resurrected, your strength will be forcibly increased.

...

“However, if you remain defeated after nine times, you will be destroyed both in body and soul.”

Hearing Yan Ruoxue’s words, Qin Yu couldn’t help but be shocked.

The Yan family had such a terrifying secret technique. Nine times? And it would increase the strength each time?

As expected of the nine great aristocratic families, the secret techniques they inherited were truly terrifying!

“As to whether you can comprehend it, that will depend on you.” Yan Ruoxue reminded him, “Remember, you must not use this technique unless it is absolutely necessary. Do you understand?”

“Alright. I understand,” Qin Yu nodded quickly and said.

“Mmm,” Yan Ruoxue responded. She then smiled and said, “Don’t worry. I’ll get rid of all these troubles for you as soon as possible.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly. He did not want to hide behind Yan Ruoxue all the time, but it seemed like he had no choice.

“Let’s go. If Uncle Yan finds out, it’ll be troublesome.” Qin Yu held Yan Ruoxue’s hand and planned to leave.

However, Yan Ruoxue had no intention of leaving.

She stared at Qin Yu, thinking of something.

...

“What’s wrong?” Qin Yu asked in doubt.

Yan Ruoxue was silent for a moment. She then raised her head to look at Qin Yu and said, “Do you know the story between the Yan family and the chaotic body?”

“No, I don’t,” Qin Yu was stunned, shook his head, and said. “I only know that there’s something unusual between the Yan family bloodline and the chaotic body.”
