Chapter 943: Chapter 943, Uncle Niu made his move 

Hearing the words of the handlebar mustache, even Qin Yu was stunned.

When did this happen? When did Wan Guqiong Scold Demon Beasts?

Uncle Niu, who was simple and honest, obviously took it seriously. He stared at Wan Guqiong and said in a deep voice, “Why did you do that?”

Wan guqiong frowned and said, “What the hell?”

Before Uncle Niu could say anything, the mustache added fuel to the fire, “Not only did this kid eat Demon Beasts, but he also cursed the immortal crane. He said that he had seen the immortal crane in his early years and almost ate it. Uncle Niu, do you think this can be tolerated?”

Hearing this, Uncle Niu’s face turned completely cold.

He strode forward and berated, “Kid, how Dare You Insult Lord Immortal Crane!”

“What nonsense? What Bullsh * t immortal crane, I don’t even know it!”Wan Gu Qiong waved his hand impatiently.

“Hey, Uncle Niu, you heard it! This kid called Lord Immortal Crane Bullsh * t!”The mustached man immediately added fuel to the fire.

Uncle Niu flew into a rage. He angrily tried wan gu qiong and shouted, “Kid, you are going too far!”

Wan Gu Qiong also became a little impatient. He took two steps back and said coldly, “Kill this lunatic!”

“Okay.”The two martial saints walked over with a cold smile. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

They looked down at uncle Niu and said, “Are you going to kill yourself, or are we going to cripple you?”

Uncle Niu said with a gloomy face, “Two reckless little bastards. If I don’t Rip Off Your Dog Head Today, I will change my name!”

“Hahaha, do you know who we are? We are martial saints from the Wan family’s secret territory. How can we be a rough man like you...”

“Boom!”

Before he could finish his words, Uncle Niu had already thrown a punch!

After he felt the strength of Uncle Niu’s fist, that martial saint’s expression immediately changed drastically!

He hurriedly raised his palm to block in front of him.

“Bang!”

Uncle Niu’s fist smashed onto his arm, instantly breaking his arm and sending his body flying!

When he saw this scene, Wan Gu Qiong’s expression immediately changed drastically!

The other martial saint could not help but widen his eyes!

“Martial saint! This person is a martial saint!”Wan Gu Qiong cried out in shock.

Uncle Niu was like a mad bull as he strode towards that martial saint!

That martial saint did not dare to be negligent. He quickly got up from the ground and formed a spell with his hands in an attempt to resist.

However, before he could complete his spell, Uncle Niu had already slapped him!

That martial saint’s face was instantly covered in blood and his bones were shattered!

Uncle Niu did not stop there. He picked up this martial saint with one hand and drew his bow from left and right as if he was holding a Chick!

At this moment, the advantage of the Demonic Beast’s body was fully displayed!

Not far away, Wan Gu Qiong’s expression changed drastically. He secretly said that things were not looking good and hurriedly looked at the martial saint beside him.

“Retreat, cover me and retreat!”Wan Gu Qiong said in a low voice.

“Yes!”That Martial Saint had long had this intention. When he heard these words, he immediately turned around and ran away with Wan Gu Qiong.

“Kid, stop and don’t Run!”The mustached man hurriedly shouted.

“Uncle Niu, quickly chase after him. That Kid has run away!”

However, at this moment, Uncle Niu was in a fit of anger. How could he care about Wan Gu Qiong.

He grabbed that martial saint’s head and bent it to the left and right. Then, he forcefully broke his head off!

Qin Yu and the mustached man were secretly delighted as they watched. The only pity was that Wan Gu Qiong had run away!

Right at this moment, that martial saint’s primordial spirit floated out from his body.

Just as he was about to leave, qin yu hurriedly shouted, “Uncle Niu, don’t let his primordial spirit escape!”

“Don’t worry.”Uncle Niu coldly shouted. Then, with a wave of his hand, he captured his primordial spirit!

“Uncle Niu, don’t crush him to death!”Qin Yu ran over excitedly and said with a grin, “Uncle Niu, do you think you can hand this primordial spirit over to me?”

Uncle Niu frowned and said, “What do you want this for?”

Qin Yu said with an embarrassed smile, “The essence soul of a martial saint is a great tonic! It has a wonderful use for my cultivation!”

Uncle Niu casually threw the essence soul to Qin Yu and said, “Suit yourself.”

Qin Yu hurriedly looked at the handlebar mustache and asked him to take out a spiritual artifact. Then, he stuffed the essence soul into it.

“I really didn’t expect that there would be unexpected gains,”Qin Yu said with satisfaction.

Uncle Niu, who was standing at the side, no longer had the desire to stay.

No matter how much Qin Yu and the moustache man tried to persuade him to stay, Uncle Niu still left this mystic realm without turning his head back.

After he left, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh slightly.

“Sigh, it’s troublesome. I’m afraid this mystic realm can’t be preserved,”Qin Yu muttered.

The moustache man hummed and said, “When Wan Gu Qiong finds out about this secret realm, he will definitely spread the news.”

“Looks like we have to find a new hiding place.”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“Let’s quickly part ways. I don’t want to be hunted down with you.”The moustache man muttered.

Qin Yu grabbed the moustache man and said with a smile, “Good brothers should share weal and woe. How Can You Leave Now?”

The handlebar moustache glared at him and said, “Screw you. I don’t want to die in the hands of a martial saint!”

Qin Yu pretended to sigh and said, “It’s not impossible for you to leave. How about this? Give me half of your spiritual stones and I’ll let you go.”

“Alright, you want to play the Shameless game with me?”The handlebar moustache said with a displeased expression.

Qin Yu said shamelessly, “Anyway, if you don’t give it to me, I won’t let you go. I’ll go wherever you go.”

“Besides, I have the line formula. Even if I’m discovered by a martial saint, I can still escape. You might not.”

The Mustache Man was so angry that he jumped up and down, blowing his beard and glaring at Qin Yu.

“You... you’re even more shameless than me!”The Mustache Man said angrily.

“Aiya, enough. I’ll just take it as a loan to you, okay? I’ll return it to you when I become a martial saint.”Qin Yu said with a smile.

The mustached man had no choice but to give Qin Yu half of the spiritual stones.

However, Qin Yu could not put any spiritual stones in his spatial divine weapon, so the mustached man could only give Qin Yu another spatial divine weapon.

“Damn it, I’ve lost so much,”the mustached man muttered.

“I’ve spent several hundred on food and spiritual stones and spiritual artifacts. You have to return it to me.”

Qin Yu said with a smile, “I promise, I’ll return ten billion to you in the future! I’ll give you as many spiritual stones as you want!”
