2388 The Strength of Holy Lord Yan

The first stage of the tribulation was the Way of Heaven and Earth. After a fifth-grade True Saint roamed in the sea of the Path of Heaven and tempered his body to the limit with the power of the Path of Heaven, he could withstand the power of the Way of Heaven and Earth and step into the Tribulation Transcending Stage.

But at this moment, Yan Tianshi had already condensed the second stage statue before the golden age was fully unleashed.

One could imagine how terrifying his talent was, no wonder he was known as the successor of Immortal Emperor Tianming.

At this moment, in the space where the two were, the distance between the two was less than a millimeter.

An obscure power of rules protected Flower Granny’s body. If her true body disappeared into the void, it was basically equivalent to losing. She might not even be able to save her life.

Numerous spatial blades aimed at Flower Granny’s eyes, throat, heart, and so on.

Yan Tianshi’s eyes narrowed slightly. The spatal blade turned blurry from clarity. It was bursting with immense power, wanting to break through the final distance and kill Flower Granny directly.

In the space of one millimeter, numerous whirlpools began to spin wildly.

“Crack!”

The countless spatial blades around Flower Granny suddenly shattered simultaneously, and countless petals fell from the sky.

Every petal, from a tender green bud to its fall onto the ground when it withered, represented the passage of time, the cruelty of time, and the obscure rules of time, all flashing by in an instant.

Yan Tianshi’s eyes suddenly opened, and he took three steps back.

Then he stared at the withered skin on his arm with a solemn expression. The skin that looked like an old man’s spread from his palm to his shoulder and every part of his body. He had turned from a middle-aged man in his prime to an old man in the blink of an eye.

The Divine Destiny Pagoda appeared in his mind, and a clear light fell on Yan Tianshi.

Only then did the power of time slowly force him out of his body. As the power of fading time left, Yan Tianshi’s body slowly recovered.

“Flower Granny, what a terrifying strength! You actually comprehended a trace of the power of time from the blooming and withering of flowers. However, I used a celestial artifact to withstand your move. I lost.”

Yan Tianshi admitted directly.

“Phew!”

Lei Xin heaved a sigh of relief. As expected, Flower Granny made it.

Winning this round meant he could be more aggressive in the upcoming negotiations.

Similarly, if Flower Granny lost, Yan Tianshi and Si Liuhe could suppress Thunder Courtyard’s most powerful combat power. They would naturally be more aggressive because they would be the ones to gain the upper hand if the battle started.

“Dean Lei said that Qin Yuru is his son, so I naturally won’t take him back. However, Yan Ruoxue is the saintess of the Yan family. No matter what, Thunder Courtyard must hand her over.”

Yan Tianshi stared at Lei Xin and Flower Granny and said.

“Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue have known each other since they were on Earth. Holy Lord had already seen their deep love when Qin Yu left the Holy Region. Holy Lord had already shown mercy previously. Why did you force them to separate today?”

Flower Granny sighed.

“If it were during the golden age, and the power of the Path of Heaven were restricted at the True Saint, it would be fine. However, the chaos is about to begin, and Grandmaster and I have already seen some ominous signs of the future. We naturally have to forgo this kind of relationship. I have already given in greatly. If the two of you are still not satisfied, let’s start a war.”

Lei Xin and Flower Granny looked at each other. They knew that this was Yan Tianshi’s bottom line.

In the end, Qin Yu was a member of Thunder Courtyard. Even if he had obtained many treasures, now that he had entered Thunder Courtyard, it would be unreasonable and overbearing for the nine great aristocratic families to come and ask for him.

However, Yan Ruoxue was the saintess of the Yan family. It was undeniable that she had received the full protection of the Yan family after she entered the Holy Region. The Yan family had indeed invested a vast amount of resources to nurture Yan Ruoxue. It would be unreasonable for Lei Xin and Flower Granny to let Yan Ruoxue stay. This had indeed crossed the bottom line.

Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue were standing not far away. Their hands were clasped together so tightly that no color of blood was seen. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

They had heard the conversation between the two parties. Lei Xin sighed.

In fact, when they came over, he wanted to stop them, but after a moment of hesitation, he decided to let them listen to the negotiation.

Although it was cruel, it was still better than suddenly enduring it when the time came.

Qin Yu’s heart felt like being stabbed by a knife. Could it be that he was unable to bring Yan Ruoxue away even after he went all out?

Why did he have to endure so many hardships day and night?

“I will never return to the Yan family even if I die!”

Yan Ruoxue’s face turned ashen. The Destiny Reincarnation Technique appeared on her body, and she looked like she was going to risk her life again.

Even if she had a strong will, she could not bear to be separated again and again.

Yesterday, she even felt that she had finally escaped the suffering and could finally live a simple life with the man she liked.

“The Destiny Reincarnation Technique is the most mysterious technique in the Yan family’s immortal scripture. However, even if you have Nine Destiny Transformation, you can only reach your current limit and can’t reverse this outcome. As the saintess of the Yan family, you have inherited the purest bloodline of heaven and earth. You have your mission the moment you attack. This is something in your bones, and you can’t reject it.”

Yan Tianshi pointed out with two fingers, and a divine sense restriction entered Yan Ruoxue’s sea of consciousness.

This restriction was not afraid of her escape but her committing suicide.

He waved his hand, and Yan Ruoxue flew into Divine Destiny Pagoda uncontrollably.

Qin Yu knelt on the ground, his body trembling crazily, and his nails digging deep into his palms.

He wanted so much to burn his soul and life to fight with the two of them.

However, as Yan Tianming had said, even the most formidable power could not do anything to him.

He also wanted to kneel in front of Flower Granny Dean Lei Xin and ask them to save Yan Ruoxue.

However, if they agreed, it would mean that the war between Thunder Courtyard and the nine great aristocratic families would be ignited.

The brothers and sisters of Demon-slaying Peak, the people he knew in Thunder Courtyard might all die in this battle.

Even Flower Granny Hua and Dean Lei might not be spared. Could he really be so disgusting and selfish?

Qin Yu bit his lip, even biting off the flesh.

As he watched Yan Tianshi leave, he hammered his chest frantically, hoping he would not feel so much pain.

Even if his bones were broken and stabbed into his lungs and heart, it could not alleviate the immense pain.

He hated himself for being incompetent and not working hard enough. When someone else took away his silly girl, he was powerless to stop it. He hated himself for being a trash!

Lei Xin turned his head with tears in his eyes. He walked up to Qin Yu’s side and silently stretched out his hand, but sadly stopped in mid-air.

What could he say to Qin Yu?

Flower Granny stood there like a statue.

Yan Tianshi floated in the air and looked at the three people below. He sighed, too.
