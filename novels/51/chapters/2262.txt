2263 The Path of the Scholar

A divine weapon appeared in Qin Yu’s hand. As long as he killed the three of them, he could return.

Qin Yu walked up to them, threw away his sword, then pulled the three into his arms.

“Goodbye, Ruoxue, Father, Mother.”

Qin Yu shed a tear.

The Soul Shattering Golden Radiance in his divine sense condensed to the extreme, and then the sword slashed down fiercely at himself.

Everything before his eyes blurred out instantly, and his world turned pitch black as if drawing of curtains.

“Like flowers, yet not flowers; everything is a dream.”

With a sigh, a ray of light lit up from his hand and wrapped up Qin Yu’s soul.

Countless scenes constantly shuttled through that path, including lives as demonic beasts, ordinary people, and cultivators standing at the peak…

Qin Yu woke up from the dream.

He suddenly opened his eyes. His back was drenched in cold sweat.

Who was that scholar? In an instant, he had experienced three lifetimes.

Many vows of love would become dull over time. No matter how strong the relationship was, it would eventually return to normal. If he did not love Yan Ruoxue so dearly, perhaps he would feel nothing after a lifetime.

The Path of Heaven was merciless because time would erase everything.

If he did not go all out, he might be stuck in the cycle of reincarnation forever, unable to return.

Perhaps he would meet a new person, a new wife, and then he could never return from reincarnation.

Furthermore, what was terrifying was that the people in the reincarnation were real and from his memories. If he cut off three people to break the path of reincarnation, he would probably never forgive himself for his entire lifetime.

After killing himself, he did not break the path of reincarnation.

In the end, it was the scholar who brought him back. It was a Path of Reincarnation that he had no solution to.

Qin Yu took a deep breath. At this moment, the mist in the soul Mystic Realm had suddenly dissipated.

“The person who created this Mystic Realm has left.”

Who exactly was this scholar? His soul cultivation had reached an unimaginable cultivation realm.

Are there any rumors about this soul Mystic Realm of the Azure Firmation Sect?”

Qin Yu suddenly asked.

“Master once said that she had read about the records left behind by the first Palace Master. A scholar created this place. This scholar once had a beloved woman, but unfortunately, she fell ill and passed away. He created the Path of Reincarnation and trapped himself within to forget the woman whose memory was deeply ingrained in his heart and mind.”

Piao Ruoyun was startled. She had heard her master tell her that story.

“Three lives in a single thought. How long has this scholar been stuck on the Path of Reincarnation?”

Even Qin Yu was shocked. The time of the soul was much longer than the time in reality. The scholar had probably been trapped in reincarnation for tens of thousands of years, but he still could not forget his lover.

“Qin Yu, is there really such a long-lasting love? I envy it, but I don’t believe in it.”

Piao Ruoyun asked in a daze.

Qin Yu looked at the sky and suddenly felt a pain in his heart. He suddenly missed that silly girl.

…

After leaving the holy land of the Azure Firmament Sect, the four elders and Piao Ruoyun advanced quite a bit.

The highest cultivation among the four had reached the seventh-grade True Saint Realm. Piao Ruoyun had also reached the sixth-grade True Saint Realm. It should not be difficult for her to take command of the Azure Firmament Sect.

He closed his eyes. At this moment, his divine sense could clearly see every rock, every undulating ground, even the demonic beasts flying across the sky and their flapping wings on the Azure Ridge Continent.

The reincarnation of three lifetimes had condensed his soul to an unimaginable state.

“Attack me using your strongest Way of Soul.”

Qin Yu said to them.

“Are you sure? My soul has surpassed my strength now. It’s close to the seventh grade of True Saint.”

“Attack with all your strength!”

Seeing that Qin Yu did not look like he was joking, a few of them immediately became serious.

“Soul Shattering Golden Radiance!”

“Soul Poisonous Sting!”

Piao Ruoyun gasped. She and Eighth Elder looked at each other in shock.

Even their Palace Master could not remain calm when a few of them attacked with their full strength.

“Even if your soul hasn’t reached the ninth-grade True Saint Realm yet, it’s probably almost there!”

Piao Ruoyun’s face was full of disbelief.

Qin Yu nodded slightly. In fact, he did not have a concrete estimate of his divine sense cultivation before, but now that Piao Ruoyun had mentioned it, he had a rough idea.

“Qin Yu, what do you plan to do next? Do you want to stay in Azure Firmament Sect to cultivate?”

Piao Ruoyun asked.

“The Mysterious Dark Sect isn’t far from here. That old fellow Shui Yuan has done many things to my friend. It’s time to settle the score.”

Qin Yu said coldly.

“Alright, I’ll gather the resources here regularly and hand them to you.”

Piao Ruoyun nodded. She was a smart person and naturally understood that Qin Yu would not give her such a great benefit for no reason.

“Alright.”

Qin Yu nodded. He took out a warship from Ming Yue’s spatial ring and was about to leave the Azure Ridge Continent.

“By the way, Qin Yu, you must be careful when you go to the Mysterious Dark Sect. Our spy in the Mysterious Dark Sect has insider news that the Mysterious Dark Sect has asked help from the Blood Sect.”

Piao Ruoyun suddenly stopped Qin Yu.

“Can you introduce the Blood Sect to me?”

Qin Yu said with a frown.

“The Blood Sect should be considered the second of the four major forces. The Azure Firmament Sect and the Mysterious Dark Sect are not comparable. The Blood Sect has many ways to control people. Therefore, the number of cultivators under their sect is as many as locusts. The strength of the Blood Sect’s sect master has long reached the peak of the ninth grade. Moreover, the sect’s power foundation is nearly ten thousand years more than ours. We don’t know how many hidden methods they have.”

Piao Ruoyun’s expression was solemn.

“Therefore, you’d better be careful. Do you need us to accompany you? With our current strength, we can help you in some ways.”

“Not for now. It’s merely the Mysterious Dark Cult. I don’t give a damn.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. Just like the nine great aristocratic families, it was the profound heritage that ultimately served as the foundation for their dominance. He was not afraid of a ninth-grade True Saint at all, but if a group of people fought without fear of death, there would be some danger.

The Mysterious Dark Sect was located on the Blue Horizon Continent, another continent besides the Fire Unicorn Continent.

Qin Yu’s warship traveled through the void for about three days before arriving on this continent. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Compared to Azure Firmament Sect, this continent seemed a little lifeless. All kinds of demonic qi raged, and there were all kinds of internal qi of the demonic beast auras in the massive forest.
