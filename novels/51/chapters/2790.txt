Chapter 2791: The Tyrannical Investiture of Gods

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

No one knew how much time had passed. It felt like a few seconds or a century.

When Fatty Situ put away the Heavenly Umbrella in his hand, Qin Yu only saw darkness.

He felt like the world was spinning and his entire body seemed to be sinking, but he couldn’t step on the ground.

The Heavenly Umbrella emitted a green light and protected them.

Although it did not continue to sink, Qin Yu still felt the world spinning.

It was as if they were in a vortex of nothingness.

“The space here has been completely destroyed. It won’t recover in a short period. We should be in the void at this moment. However, the Investiture of Gods is here, so this space hasn’t collapsed.”

Fatty gasped.

The destructive power of the Endless Energy Tribulation just now was so terrifying.

Moreover, he found that the number of people just now had already decreased by 70-80% under this Endless Energy Tribulation.

Only those Creepy ranked at the top were left under the endless tribulation.

The Endless Energy Tribulation just now silently killed so many people.

If it weren’t for Fatty Situ’s Heavenly Umbrella, they would have ended similarly.

At this moment, a piece of paper stretched out from the void. It emitted a dark green light.

Sound could not be transmitted in the void.

However, everyone could hear the eerie music playing for some reason.

“Gong, gong, gong…”

The terrifying voice seemed to have sounded directly from the depths of one’s divine soul, making one impossible to hide.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Countless energy chains shot out in all directions.

There were actually strands of energy chains that combined those Creepy with the Investiture of Gods.

“It’s indeed the Investiture of Gods! Hahahaha!” A maniacal laugh suddenly sounded.

Ming Alester laughed maniacally.

As one of the top clans in the Saint World, very few things could move them.

This supreme treasure that had suddenly appeared might break their fate.

Even if they had to become Creepy, so what if they could break this fate?

The moment the Investiture of Gods landed, all the Creepy pounced crazily at the paper in an instant.

They did not even defend themselves.

“If I can raise my consciousness to a higher level, I’ll pay any price!”

Qin Ji’s head split open. Countless tentacles reached toward the Investiture of Gods.

Countless Creepy’s consciousnesses crazily drilled into the Investiture of Gods. They had only entered it with a wisp of consciousness to obtain the indestructible force.

This internal qi was like a drug to them, causing their divine souls to tremble.

“Give it to me!”

A sword light slashed out horizontally.

It was as if a red-hot branding iron was cutting through ice, cutting the entire space.

It was the young swordsman from before who made this move. He wanted to cut down the entire void space and obtain the Investiture of Gods.

In an instant, countless Creepy were cut in half.

However, the two halves of their bodies suddenly stretched out countless tentacles and crazily squeezed toward the green paper again.

Boom!

The swordlight landed a thousand meters away from the paper. A huge spark erupted as two metals collided.

“Open!”

The young man let go of the sword in his hand.

A palm slammed onto the sword hilt. In an instant, the storm in the void began to ripple.

The storm instantly entered the Spiritual Energy Sword and it suddenly increased by ten times.

Boom!

A dull sound came from the void. This sword actually pierced through the Investiture of Gods.

The young swordsman laughed loudly as the area within a hundred meters of the Investiture of Gods collapsed.

A Spiritual Energy Sword appeared under his feet. He immediately rode his sword to the side of the Investiture of Gods.

He was about to grab the Investiture of Gods.

A green-black power suddenly exploded. The next moment, the young swordsman’s body suddenly stopped.

His hands and feet were arched back as if he was tied up.

In the next moment, the Investiture of Gods suddenly enlarged hundreds of times.

Black runes slowly appeared on it. They were two ancient names.

As the two incomprehensible words were completed, the young swordsman suddenly returned to normal.

“His divine soul has been absorbed by the Investiture of Gods.”

When Qin Yu saw the swordsman who was different from before, his hair stood on end.

Even such a powerful young swordsman was not a match for this Investiture of Gods.

“Retreat further. Retreat further…”

Aiden’s voice was trembling. If one was affected by this battle, one would be crushed into pieces.

An emerald green vine had appeared out of nowhere.

With the appearance of the vine, everyone felt as hot as the sun.

“Divine Sun Vine! This old fellow has gone crazy to take out such a thing.”

Fatty Situ muttered.

This divine vine was an existence that could bind the Saints.

The Fallen Angel Lucifer, the Lord of the Saint Kingdom, was tied up by the vines and severely injured by the Situ family in a battle. This battle also made the Situ family famous. In that battle, countless Dharma Treasures made the Lord of the Saint Kingdom suffer.

The wealthiest and most powerful family had emerged from that time. The divine vine played a crucial role at that time.

The Investiture of Gods seemed to have sensed the danger and burst out with a bright energy light.

It slowly opened the Divine Sun Vine. But in the next moment, the thorny Divine Sun Vine wrapped around it tightly again.

The three men in black each held one end of the Investiture of Gods and tried to capture it together.

“Take it down with all might!” The leader in black roared.

Boom!

A terrifying power instantly erupted from the divine vine.

This power crazily attacked the Investiture of Gods. However, they seemed to be unable to touch the Investiture of Gods although they had tried their best. Instead, a violent energy backfired from the divine vine, shaking the three of them off.

“Let go!”

The leader in black roared.

The three of them immediately let go of the Divine Sun Vine.

A surging force sent the divine vine into the void like lightning. A violent force flashed from not far away from Qin Yu.

Fatty Situ looked at the huge hole with lingering fear.

If the three of them had not let go just now, they would probably have ended up in the void.

“Retreat!”

The three of them suddenly landed beside Fatty Situ and brought him thousands of meters away in an instant.

“Wait, dont be anxious! Don’t forget that I still have that thing.”

Fatty Situ was very anxious.

“Although this is an incomplete version, it’s not something we can get our hands on. If we could set it up earlier and use the entire Situ family’s sources, we might be able to do it. However, this is far from what we can do now.”

The leader in black shook his head and smiled bitterly..
