Chi Feng’s entire body instantly began to shrivel from the Heaven Swallowing Technique!

Streams of inner strength from an eighth level Inner Strength Grandmaster flowed through Qin Yu’s palm into his body and circulated through his meridians!

After a full half a minute, Qin Yu had completely absorbed the inner strength in Chi Feng’s body.

“How comfortable!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but let out a breath of relief.

Looking at Chi Feng, who was lying on the ground, Gu Taichu had mixed feelings.

He opened his mouth, but didn’t know what to say.

“Master Gu, he deserved it. I have already shown mercy.” Qin Yu glanced at Gu Taichu and said in a low voice.

Indeed, Qin Yu didn’t devour his divine sense, so he had already shown mercy.

Gu Taichu waved his hand and said, “Forget it, forget it.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He turned around, and prepared to leave with Gu Taichu and Yao Qing.

After devouring Chi Feng’s inner strength, he had recovered a little of the loss of the Enlightenment Tea.

Of course, compared to the Enlightenment Tea, an eighth level Inner Strength Grandmaster wasn’t worth mentioning.

After returning, Qin Yu personally treated Gu Taichu and Yao Qing’s injuries.

Fortunately, their injuries weren’t serious, and their lives weren’t in danger. They only needed to rest for a few days.

In the next few days, Qin Yu entered closed-door cultivation.

He absorbed the spiritual energy from Bin Province into his body.

With Chi Feng’s inner strength, Qin Yu even felt that he had reached the boundary of the second level of the Monastic Stage.

After three consecutive days, Gu Taichu’s injuries had finally healed.

He knocked on Qin Yu’s door and walked in.

Gu Taichu sat by Qin Yu’s side and sighed. “I really didn’t expect that after you became an Inner Strength Past Master, you could easily crush an eighth level Inner Strength Grandmaster. It’s really unheard of.”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “This doesn’t mean anything. Moreover, the path I’m taking is also different from yours.”

Just as Qin Yu said, Chi Feng had just become an eighth level Inner Strength Grandmaster, so he couldn’t display his full strength.

Moreover, Chi Feng was no longer in his peak state at that time. Otherwise, Qin Yu wouldn’t have been able to win so easily.

“I’ve heard of the path of cultivation,” Gu Taichu said in a deep voice.

Hearing this, Qin Yu quickly looked at Gu Taichu.

In fact, Qin Yu had never understood the difference between the two.

Gu Taichu said slowly, “The current martial artists are actually descendants of former cultivators. However, they have been slowly lost in the succession of generations.”

“In other words, the internal strength that martial artists now cultivate is the weakened version of that of the cultivators.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. Just like what Gu Taichu said, there were indeed some differences between the two sides.

“Master Gu, then how can this division of realms be considered equal?” Qin Yu asked in puzzlement. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Gu Taichu said, “There isn’t much difference between cultivation’s and the martial artists’ realm division. It’s just that... cultivation relies on purer spiritual energy, so the effect is naturally different.”

“If there is any specific difference... it would be about one to two small realms.”

One to two small realms?

In other words, under normal circumstances, Qin Yu could only fight against a third level Inner Strength Grandmaster?

But the current Qin Yu could be said to be invincible among those of the same level.

Qin Yu also had the ability to fight most Inner Strength Grandmasters!

“Of course, everyone’s talent is different,” Gu Taichu said.

“Even in the same realm, the difference in strength is hard to describe.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. As the saying went, fighting someone far higher in realm level was the basic ability of a genius. It wasn’t worth mentioning at all.

As for how many ranks one could cross, no one could say for sure.

With Gu Taichu’s explanation, Qin Yu had a general understanding.

“Let’s go and eat,” Gu Taichu stood up and said.

Qin Yu agreed and then went to the dining room with Gu Taichu.

The Gu family’s home seemed a little barren currently.

Even the dishes were personally cooked by Gu Taichu.

“This is a pot of good wine from my collection. It’s thirty years old.” Gu Taichu took a jar and poured a cup for Qin Yu and Yao Qing.

After a mouthful of wine, Qin Yu immediately felt a wave of warmth in his stomach.

“It’s good wine!” Qin Yu praised from the bottom of his heart!

Gu Taichu said with some pride, “These years, I’ve been most proud of the Enlightenment Tea and this jar of good wine! If I hadn’t lost the Enlightenment Tea, I definitely wouldn’t have taken out this jar of wine!”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh. “Another cup!”

After three cups of wine, Qin Yu could clearly feel that this wine contained traces of spiritual energy.

Although it was very subtle, it still surprised Qin Yu.

“It seems that the environment thirty years ago was much better than it is now,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

“Master Gu, has three days passed?” Qin Yu frowned and asked.

Gu Taichu froze, then he nodded and said, “Yes, it has been four days since then.”

Qin Yu rubbed his chin and couldn’t help but sneer. “Four days? Dong Tianhai’s herbs haven’t been delivered yet. It seems that I have to make a trip there myself.”

Dong Tianhai didn’t know Qin Yu wasn’t dead. When he saw that Qin Yu was in the sea of lightning, he was certain Qin Yu would die.

Therefore, he directly returned to Peach Blossom City, which was a hundred kilometers away, that day.

“Are you really going to look for Dong Tianhai?” Gu Taichu said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu sneered. “There’s no reason not to settle the debt. Moreover, there are many legends in the Peach Blossom City. I really want to go and take a look.”

Peach Blossom City had produced divine herbs that were more than a thousand years old three times! Those that were more than a hundred years old would be discovered every year!

This was also one of the reasons why Dong Tianhai had so many stocks.

“Qin Yu, you have to think carefully. Dong Tianhai possessing so many herbs without it being taken from him means that he must be quite powerful,” Gu Taichu said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Master Gu, don’t worry. I have my own plans.”

At this point, Qin Yu even invited him, “Master Gu, come with me. It’s a nice opportunity to relax.”

Gu Taichu shook his head and refused, “Forget it. I’ll just stay here.”

Qin Yu didn’t insist anymore.

That day, Qin Yu brought Yao Qing out of Bin Province and headed straight for Peach Blossom City.

At this moment, Dong Tianhai was in his warehouse with a satisfied expression on his face.

Looking at the fortune that he had accumulated over the years, Dong Tianhai felt indescribably proud.

“Master, the three Inner Strength Grandmasters that you asked us to invite are already here.” At this moment, a disciple walked forward and said.

Dong Tianhai sneered. “No need anymore. Let them go back. Qin Yu is already dead. We don’t need their help anymore.”

“Oh right, remember to give each of them a stalk of hundred-year-old herbs as an apology.”

The disciple hurriedly nodded and said, “Yes, Master.”

At this point, the disciple seemed to have thought of something and continued, “Oh right, master, Tonight seems to be the night of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s Divine Alchemist event. Don’t forget.”

Dong Tianhai slapped his head and couldn’t help but curse, “It’s all Qin Yu’s fault that I almost forgot about this matter!”
