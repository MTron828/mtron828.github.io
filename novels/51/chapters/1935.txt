1936 Blackmail!

The old man laughed coldly and continued to tighten his grip on the horsetail whisk.

Qin Yu’s bones were crushed in many places, and the cracking sound of his body became even more obvious.

However, he did not give up and continued to resist with all his might.

The old man seemed to be struggling. He closed his eyes and focused on controlling the horsetail whisk.

Just as Qin Yu’s body was about to be crushed, a golden dagger suddenly shot out from his glabella!

The dagger’s speed was extremely fast, and it arrived in front of the old man in almost an instant!

The old man suddenly felt a strong sense of danger. He opened his eyes and quickly wanted to retreat, but it was too late.

The dagger pierced through the old man’s forehead, instantly shattering his primordial spirit!

His body fell straight onto the ground, resulting in a large pit on the ground. He was dead.

After he died, the horsetail whisk fell off Qin Yu’s body.

Qin Yu shook his arms and felt pain all over.

“It’s fortunate to have this primordial spirit attack,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Otherwise, he would have been killed here today.

The dagger returned to Qin Yu’s glabella. He bent down and put the horsetail whisk into his sack.

“This horsetail whisk is not simple. Tsk! Tsk! I made a fortune,” Qin Yu muttered.

He had wanted to exchange the ores for some spirit coins. He didn’t expect to save the ores!

Qin Yu searched the cave and found a lot of herbs and spirit coins.

The old man wasn’t exaggerating. They did have tens of billions of spirit coins!

“I wonder how many people these b*stards have robbed,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

At this moment, he found a few extremely huge water tanks in the corner.

The water tanks were sealed. They seemed to have contained some special liquid.

Qin Yu moved forward and sniffed. He found out the smell in the cave was coming from these water tanks.

“What is this? It can actually avoid Demonic Beast,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“I don’t care. I’ll take all!” Qin Yu thought.

With this thing, he could hide in the Azure Rock Forest if he were left with no choice in the future.

The Azure Rock Forest was taboo in Holy Region. No one was willing to step into it rashly, especially the depths, which were even more mysterious.

Qin Yu planned to take all the treasures away, but obviously, his Spatial Magic Artifact could no longer accommodate them.

“I remember this mountain seems like a magical artifact… ” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He looked around and decided to take the mountain with him, but he didn’t know how to put away this magical artifact.

“If I had known it earlier, I would have kept this old man alive,” Qin Yu said with annoyance.

After that, Qin Yu tried many ways to reduce the size of the mountain but failed.

Regardless of a spell or a blood contract, it was useless.

Qin Yu had no choice but to give up.

Fortunately, this place was quite remote, so no one would probably come here anytime soon.

Therefore, Qin Yu left the cave after keeping away the spirit coins.

With tens of billions of spirit coins, Qin Yu would not be short of money temporarily. He immediately went to the station and embarked on the teleportation formation without further ado.

Under the teleportation of the formation, Qin Yu soon arrived at the foot of the mountain of the Yan family.

Qin Yu could not help taking a deep breath as he looked up at the beautiful Yan family, which was like a fairyland.

“I wonder if this will bring trouble to Yan Ruoxue,” Qin Yu whispered to himself.

However, Yan Ruoxue was the inheritor of the Yan family’s bloodline, so the Yan family would definitely protect her.

“I hope this plan works.” Qin Yu smiled bitterly.

He was not in a hurry to shout. Instead, he sat at the side for a while as though he was preparing himself mentally.

At the same time, the people sent by the Si family followed Qin Yu’s internal qi and came to the Yan family.

“This kid actually came to the Yan family. It seems his relationship with Saintess Yan is not ordinary,” one of them said coldly.

“That’s right. Since they’re from the same place and have the same chaotic body, they definitely know each other,” another person said.

“Alright, let’s not waste any more time. Let’s get rid of him quickly.”

They looked at each other and slowly disappeared into the darkness, traveling through the void toward the Yan family.

Qin Yu, who was at the foot of the mountain of the Yan family, finally made up his mind.

“D*mn it! It’s good that the man with the mustache gave me this treasure.” Qin Yu flipped his palm and took out the loudspeaker.

Without the loudspeaker, Qin Yu’s shout would not have created any impact. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Picking up the loudspeaker, Qin Yu shouted with all his might, “Yan Ruoxue, I love you! I’m definitely going to marry you!”

This shout immediately stunned everyone on the spot!

All the people in the surroundings, who were planning to climb the stone stairways, turned their heads to look at Qin Yu!

Qin Yu acted as though no one was around and continued to shout, “I’m Qin Yu. Yan Ruoxue, I love you. I’ll definitely be the one to marry you in the future! I will compete fairly with Si Shiyue!”

...

Everyone was shocked! They could not believe what they had heard!

“This kid… Is he crazy? You came to the Yan family to tease the saintess?”

“Did you guys hear that? He’s going to compete with Si Shiyue… This kid is indeed provoking the Si family!”

“Qin Yu? This name is very unfamiliar, I don’t think I’ve heard of it before…”

Although many people admired Yan Ruoxue, they would also express their love for her in private.

However, someone like Qin Yu, who shouted in front of the Yan family, had never appeared before!

The people of the Si family who were chasing after Qin Yu also heard his shout.

They stopped in their tracks, and their faces were full of coldness.

“This kid is simply courting death!”

“Hurry up and kill him!”

They didn’t dare to waste time and hurriedly ran toward Qin Yu!

...

Qin Yu didn’t care about the discussions around him. He seemed to be immersed in his own world as he shouted desperately.

“Si Shiyue, I, Qin Yu, will compete with you fairly! I hope you can face me like a man! I also hope you won’t rely on your family’s power to attack me unless you’re a coward!” Qin Yu said slyly.

It was clearly blackmail. As one of the nine great aristocratic families, the Si family didn’t know if they should respond.

“D*mn it! Does Xi Shiyue know him? He’s just simply challenging people!”

“That’s right. The Si family could kill him as easily as stomping an ant!”

“I guess the Si family can’t be bothered with him!”

Qin Yu knew the time was not right yet. Therefore, he continued to shout, “Si Shiyue, if you’re afraid of me, you can send someone to kill me! If you’re not, compete with me fairly! Do you dare?”

If Si Shiyue, who was tens of thousands of stars away, heard these words, he would probably vomit blood from anger!

Meanwhile, the people sent by the Si family also arrived nearby Qin Yu.
