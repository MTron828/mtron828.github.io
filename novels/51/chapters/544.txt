Chapter 545: Who Exactly Was My Father Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel stunned.

Was he the one who broke the status quo?

But the current Qin Yu wasn’t even a Martial Marquis, so how could he go against the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?

“Think carefully about your strength after becoming a Martial Marquis,” Jiang He said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu suddenly remembered the state he was in when he forcefully became a Martial Marquis.

That kind of power made Qin Yu extremely confident.

He even felt that no one in the world could defeat him!

Even when he was facing more than ten Martial Marquises, Qin Yu didn’t care at all! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“When you step into the Martial Marquis Realm, everything will turn for the better,” said Jiang He.

“But you have to be careful. They won’t let you step into the Martial Marquis Realm so smoothly.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “Mr. Jiang, I understand.”

Jiang He nodded and said, “Young man, work hard.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything.

He understood the logic, but right now, Qin Yu was only thinking about Yan Ruoxue.

He couldn’t figure out why Yan Ruoxue, whom he should have taken away, was taken away by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

After returning to the Elder’s Residence, Qin Yu couldn’t calm down for a long time.

“Stepping into the Martial Marquis Realm will usher in a change...” Qin Yu gritted his teeth.

After thinking about it, he still couldn’t accept it.

However, at the moment, Qin Yu had no other choice but to wait for the Pavilion Master’s news.

For the entire day, Qin Yu wasn’t in the mood to cultivate at all.

The next day, the Pavilion Master sent someone to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association to inquire.

In the evening, the Pavilion Master finally arrived at the Elder’s Residence.

Qin Yu hurriedly stood up and said, “Pavilion Master, how is it?”

The Pavilion Master was silent for a moment, then said, “The Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s security measures are very strict. I also don’t know their purpose.”

Qin Yu’s expression immediately became even uglier!

Even the Pavilion Master didn’t have any news? How could this be?

“No!” Qin Yu suddenly stood up.

He said coldly , “I must head to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association immediately to get to the bottom of the matter!”

The Pavilion Master glanced at Qin Yu and said, “Do you think that by going to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, you will be able to find out more information?”

Qin Yu immediately felt somewhat powerless.

He sat on the bed and didn’t know what to do for a moment.

“Let’s talk about it after you step into the Martial Marquis Realm. Tomorrow, I will personally make a trip to Jingdu and go scout for news,” the Pavilion Master said.

Qin Yu sighed and said, “This is the only way.”

The next day, the Pavilion Master left early in the morning and rushed towards Jingdu.

Meanwhile, Qin Yu had already begun to become anxious.

“As long as I step into the Martial Marquis Realm, things will take a turn for the better...” Qin Yu repeated these words silently.

He couldn’t calm down for a long time. As long as he closed his eyes, he would think of Yan Ruoxue.

This also made Qin Yu even more anxious. He couldn’t wait to step into the Martial Marquis Realm.

Now, staying in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion could no longer bring about any improvements to Qin Yu.

With Qin Yu’s current state, unless he had a stalk of ten-thousand-year-old herbs, or resources such as spirit veins, spirit springs, and dark energy tombs, he wouldn’t be able to improve.

Therefore, Qin Yu could only plan to leave and go out to try his luck.

That evening, the Pavilion Master finally returned from Jingdu.

Upon seeing the Pavilion Master, Qin Yu ran over anxiously.

“Pavilion Master, how is it?” Qin Yu asked impatiently.

The Pavilion Master shook her head regretfully and said, “There’s still no news. Even the Yan family doesn’t know what the Jingdu Martial Arts Association is going to do.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but fly into a rage!

“The Yan family doesn’t care about Ruoxue’s life or death at all!” Qin Yu said angrily.

“Yan Sihai used Ruoxue as a tool, and Yan Yongxiu is also a coward! Why would they care about what the Jingdu Martial Arts Association is going to do?!”

Seeing Qin Yu’s unhinged appearance, the Pavilion Master didn’t know what to do for a moment.

“F * ck, since you can’t find out, I’ll go to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association personally!” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Didn’t they want to capture me? Then I’ll let them capture me. At that time, I don’t believe that I won’t be able to find out!”

“Qin Yu, don’t be rash.” The Pavilion Master frowned.

The situation of his beloved was unknown. Who could endure it?!

Everyone had a weakness, and Qin Yu was no exception.

As long as one’s Achilles’ heel was touched, no one could maintain a calm state of mind.

“I might know the reason.”

Just then, someone suddenly walked in from outside.

This person was none other than Old Mister Yan.

Seeing Old Mister Yan, Qin Yu felt as if he had seen his family.

He hurriedly said, “Old Mister Yan, what exactly is going on? Ruoxue is just an ordinary person, so why would the Jingdu Martial Arts Association take her away?!”

Old Mister Yan waved his hand, gesturing for Qin Yu to sit down.

The two of them sat opposite each other. Old Mister Yan paused, then said, “This matter might have something to do with your father.”

“My father?” Qin Yu was instantly stunned.

Old Mister Yan drank a mouthful of water and spoke slowly.

“Back then, I received the favor of your father. Otherwise, the Yan family wouldn’t be what it is now,” Old Mister Yan said.

He looked at Qin Yu and continued, “Do you know why I asked Ruoxue to look for you in Jiangcheng?”

Qin Yu shook his head. Of course he didn’t know.

Yan Ruoxue was a high and mighty heiress, and he was a good-for-nothing son-in-law who was already married.

Logically speaking, it was impossible for the two of them to have any connection.

Regarding this, Qin Yu had always been extremely puzzled.

Old Mister Yan said, “This was also your father’s idea. He only told me that the two of you are a match made in heaven.”

“He told me that the two of you must be together, but he didn’t tell me the reason.”

Qin Yu was dumbstruck and confused.

What did he mean by saying that the two of them had to be together? How did his father know that the two of them were a match made in heaven?

“If I’m not mistaken, the two of you being together will definitely be for the best,” Old Mister Yan continued.

“So, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s action is probably just to prevent the two of you from being together and bringing disaster to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

Qin Yu furrowed his brows and said, “Old Mister Yan, is what you said true? It can’t be just to comfort me, right?”

Old Mister Yan smiled bitterly and said, “Ruoxue is my beloved granddaughter. I’m more worried than you.”

Qin Yu was speechless. This was true. The entire Jingdu knew that the person Old Mister Yan cared about the most was Yan Ruoxue.

“Although the Jingdu Martial Arts Association is powerful, they definitely won’t ignore the influence of the Yan family,” Old Mister Yan said.

“So, Ruoxue should be safe.”

Upon hearing Old Mister Yan’s words, Qin Yu felt slightly relieved.

“You should listen to the Pavilion Master. There are some things that can not be rushed,” Old Mister Yan said.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and nodded. “I understand, Old Mister Yan.”

At this point, Qin Yu paused.

He looked at Old Mister Yan and continued to ask, “You said that you once received the favor of my father. Does that mean that you knew him?”

Old Mister Yan took a sip of water and nodded. “I knew him.”

“Then... then where is he? What kind of person is he? Why have I never seen him before?” Qin Yu asked anxiously.
