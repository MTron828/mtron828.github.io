In fact, Wei Jiang was also very unhappy with Xu Maokun’s attitude. However, Xu Maokun had just helped him, so it was really not appropriate for him to turn hostile.

At this moment, Wei Jiang gave Qin Yu a thumbs up deep down when he heard Qin Yu’s words.

Xu Maokun sneered and said, “You doubt my diagnosis? On what basis? On the basis of your deceitful Chinese Medicine?”

Qin Yu said coldly, “Don’t think that just because you’ve been abroad for a few years that you’ve seen the world. Let me tell you, I’ve seen a lot of people like you!”

“As for whether I’m lying or not, it’s not up to you to decide.”

After saying this, Qin Yu looked at Wei Jiang and said, “Mr. Wei, let me take a look at your wife. Is that alright?”

“Mr. Wei, do you think it’s necessary?” Xu Maojun’s tone was a bit threatening.

Wei Jiang’s expression was a bit awkward. He braced himself and said, “Since you’re here, why don’t I let you take a look...”

“Take a look?” Xu Maojun’s expression turned cold. He snorted and said, “In that case, you don’t need me. Let him treat your wife!”

Wei Jiang’s expression suddenly became a bit ugly.

In order to treat his wife, Wei Jiang had already spent too much effort.

This time, he had to use countless connections to invite Xu Maokun.

If Xu Maokun refused to treat her, Wei Jiang really wouldn’t know what to do.

“Mr. Wei, please return that bottle of medicine to him. He isn’t the only doctor in the world,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Wei Jiang felt distressed deep down.

Qin Yu made it sound easy. If it was really that simple, why would he invite Xu Maokun?

“Mr. Wei.” Qin Yu saw that Wei Jiang was hesitant, so he walked forward.

He said seriously, “I promise you. I will definitely be able to cure your wife’s illness.”

Qin Yu’s medical heritage could be considered omnipotent. It didn’t bring people back from the dead, but it was close.

Therefore, Qin Yu was full of confidence.

However, Wei Jiang was a little worried. Wei Hang, who was at the side, said anxiously, “No, Dad, we can’t take this risk!”

Wei Jiang, his expression conflicted, frowned.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly waved his hand, and a gush of wind instantly rushed towards Wei Jiang!

“Crack!”

Then, the medicine bottle in Wei Jiang’s hand shattered! The medicine was scattered all over the ground!

Seeing this scene, Wei Hang was instantly furious and immediately berated, “What are you doing?!”

Qin Yu said indifferently, “Since Mr. Wei doesn’t know what decision to make, I’ll make the choice for him.”

Wei Jiang opened his mouth. Although he was angry deep down, he couldn’t lose his temper.

“Since things have come to this, I can only ask Mr. Qin to go take a look.” Wei Jiang sighed.

Xu Maojun, who wasn’t far away, sneered as he said, “Mr. Wei, this will be the worst decision you’ve ever made in your life.”

Qin Yu ignored him and strode toward Wei Jiang’s bedroom.

After pushing the door open, he saw a pale woman lying on the bed.

She looked extremely weak, and it was difficult for her to even speak.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He walked to the woman’s side quickly.

“Mrs. Wei, please relax,” Qin Yu said politely.

After saying that, Qin Yu slowly raised his hand and placed it on her forehead.

“This is called treatment?” Xu Maojun couldn’t help but sneer.

Wei Jiang was also a bit worried.

Ever since his wife fell ill, he had looked for countless Chinese and Western doctors, but he had never seen such a treatment method.

“If anything happens to my mother, I definitely won’t let you off the hook!” Wei Hang said through gritted teeth.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He just placed his hand on the woman’s head.

A few minutes later, Qin Yu finally took his hand away.

“Mr. Qin, how is she?” Wei Jiang asked anxiously.

Qin Yu didn’t answer Wei Jiang. Instead, he looked coldly at Xu Maojun.

“You are indeed useless,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

Xu Maojun was stunned. Then, he said angrily, “What did you say? You said I am useless? I studied abroad for several years, and now...”

“Even if you studied abroad for a hundred years, you are still useless after studying.” Qin Yu interrupted Xu Maojun’s words coldly.

“You said Mrs. Wei has low blood sugar. You are simply babbling bullsh*t! How many people will die because of a quack like you?” Qin Yu berated loudly.

Xu Maojun’s expression was extremely ugly. He gritted his teeth and said, “You think you’re qualified to give me pointers? Alright, since you said that it’s not low blood sugar, then say what illness it is!”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “This is a brain aneurysm.”

Although Qin Yu hadn’t studied medicine, he could clearly feel the abnormality in Mrs. Wei’s brain. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

There was an extremely small black spot in her artery. Other than a brain aneurysm, Qin Yu couldn’t think of anything else.

However, Xu Maojun couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“Kid, do you know what you are talking about? If it’s a brain aneurysm, will the hospital not be able to find it? Hahahaha!” Xu Maojun raised his head and burst into laughter.

Wei Jiang also frowned and said, “Yes, we have gone to the hospital to check many times, but they have never found an aneurysm...”

Qin Yu said in a sullen voice, “This cerebral aneurysm is still very small. Maybe it has just grown out. Otherwise, your wife would have passed away long ago.”

“You’re talking nonsense!” Wei Hang couldn’t hold it in anymore. He took a step forward and shouted, “Get out of here! If you dare to curse my mother again, I will never forgive you!”

“You dare to be rude to Mr. Qin? You’re courting death!” Yao Qing, ready to attack, took a step forward.

Qin Yu stretched out his hand to stop Yao Qing.

He looked at Wei Jiang and said, “Mr. Wei, please make a decision on this matter.”

“Mr. Wei, if you tell him to get lost now, I can give you another bottle of medicine,” Xu Maojun took out another bottle of medicine from his bag and said indifferently.

Wei Jiang was once again in a dilemma and didn’t know how to make a decision for a moment.

One was a doctor who had studied abroad, and the other was a person who had never studied systematically and couldn’t even be considered a doctor... Most people would probably choose the former.

After thinking for a while, Wei Jiang cupped his hands to Qin Yu and sighed, “Mr. Qin, I hope you don’t blame me. I love my wife very much. I really don’t want to take this risk...”

“Hahahaha, kid, you heard him, right? Hurry up and get lost!” Xu Maojun couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

Qin Yu was stunned, and then he couldn’t help but force a smile.

“Mr. Wei, I don’t blame you.” Qin Yu shook his head. He understood that Wei Jiang loved his wife dearly.

“But I have to remind you.” Qin Yu sighed and continued, “I’m afraid your wife only has six hours left. After six hours, even God won’t be able to save her.”

“Bullsh * t, Mr. Wei, don’t listen to his nonsense!” Xu Maojun scolded loudly.

Wei Jiang cupped his hands towards Qin Yu again and said, “I will definitely remember your words.”

“Ignorant.” Yao Qing couldn’t help but snort coldly.

After that, the two of them turned their heads and left the Wei family’s residence.

After walking out of the door, Yao Qing couldn’t help but ask, “Mr. Qin, does Mrs. Wei really only have six hours left?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I know some mystical arts. Her Disease and Erosion Chambers have already turned black. She only has six hours at most.”
