Qin Yu frowned slightly and was about to say something.

In an instant, a small vortex suddenly appeared on the pool of yellow viscous liquid on the ground.

It sank underground.

The area where the two of them were was suddenly filled with strong winds and yellow sand.

The ground shook slightly, followed by countless huge figures slowly drilled out of the zround.

Upon closer inspection, there were nearly a hundred sand monsters and they had already surrounded them.

“Poisonous Sand Demon Crocodiles, each of these killing crocodiles is at least in the Dao Realm. They can already draw the holy energy of this Saint Kingdom. Be careful!”

The girl in the short skirt shouted. She raised the silver sword in her hand and slashed.

A Spiritual Energy Sword pierced through hundreds of meters. The killing crocodiles near the Spiritual Energy Sword were all shredded into pieces.

In the time it took for a sword move, countless huge palms formed from sand slapped down on the area where the two of them were.

Run!

Before Qin Yu could react, he came into contact with a warm and soft body.

The girl in the short skirt pulled him away from the area.

“You’re so clumsy! Don’t blame me if you die! Hold your breath. The sand they’ve stirred up contains their venom. You’ll be poisoned if you inhale it!”

Qin Yu was a little speechless. Just as he was about to say something, the girl had already charged into the group of killing crocodiles.

Although these killing crocodiles were in the Dao Realm, they were much weaker than the girl.

Under the silver sword in her hand, these killing crocodiles were no match for her.

In a short period, these hundred Poisonous Sand Demonic Crocodiles had almost all died, leaving only a few scattered sand crocodiles.

Qin Yu’s expression froze.

His Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze saw that after these killing crocodiles died, their blood was not only all injected into the ground.

They were also flowing slowly in one direction. It seemed that there was a much stronger Demonic Beast there.

Before he could say anything, he heard a huge explosion.

A huge wave of air exploded. The poisonous sand that filled the sky instantly enveloped the surrounding area.

The vast amount of poisonous sand mist was like sticky porridge. After blowing through Qin Yu’s body, he only felt a burning pain as if his skin was about to be torn apart.

The poisonous sand seemed to be alive, trying to enter his body and destroy it.

A wave of poisonous sand that was nearly a few hundred meters wide swept up and spewed into the sky like a fountain.

In the blink of an eye, the poisonous sand turned in the air like a python.

Then, it transformed into a huge fist with lightning speed and smashed into the girl.

The girl was sent flying by the huge fist. Her face turned pale, and the silver sword in her hand dropped uncontrollably.

The moment she landed on the ground, dozens of punches landed on her from all directions.

However, those huge fists suddenly stopped in front of her and turned into a huge quicksand that slowly fell.

“You?”

The girl stared at Qin Yu in horror. At this moment, Qin Yu appeared in front of the king of the sand crocodile and stabbed the dagger in his hand into its body, turning it into minced meat.

“What’s your strength now? Why are you so strong despite your body being so weak?”

The girl asked curiously.

She had thought that he was a weakling, but she did not expect to meet a big shot.

“What happened in this area? I don’t remember it being like this before.” Qin Yu ignored the young girl’s question and asked with a frown.

Now, this place was in ruins. Half of the Demon Sealing Valley disappeared.

The other half had almost turned into a desert. All kinds of demonic beasts ran amok, and the remaining people in the entire Demon Sealing Valley seemed to have numb expressions.

The number of people in the entire Demon Sealing Valley had decreased by nearly 70%.

The rest of the people were terrified and curled up in a small area.

“Brother, what do you mean by before?”

The young girl asked carefully when she saw that Qin Yu’s expression was a little ugly.

“Before the Demon Sealing Valley was destroyed.”

“During the battle at the Demon Sealing Valley, Wu Tian destroyed half of the valley with a twelfth-grade black lotus. Half of the people in the valley used their lives to activate the Devil-Sealing Valley’s ultimate treasure, the Book of Earth of the Saint Kingdom. That was how half of the valley was preserved.” The girl roughly explained the matter to Qin Yu.

“However, too many creatures have died here, so different types of Demonic Beasts have been born. The sand crocodiles are one of them, so the remaining people in the Demon Sealing Valley are not having a good time. They can’t leave this area, and neither can they resist these powerful demonic beasts. We’re here to protect them as much as possible.”

The girl sighed and continued.

“However, there are too many new Demonic Beasts and powerful demon beasts. Therefore, even though many people from the core area have come out, there are still fewer and fewer people left in the Demon Sealing Valley.”

Qin Yu shook his head. There was indeed nothing he could do about this matter. This area was too big. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

There were living beings slaughtering each other every moment. Even if he wanted to save them, it was too late.

“I don’t know why, but the devils of the Ancient Devil Realm didn’t continue to attack the Demon Sealing Valley. Otherwise, the people inside wouldn’t have survived. Right now, the Demon Sealing Valley’s combat strength is almost completely exhausted. There’s no way to stop these demons.”

The girl looked at the Ancient Demon Land and said in doubt.

“Oh ya, you haven’t told me your name yet. I’m Ruoyao, the Guardian of Order of the Saint Kingdom. Here, this is my medal.”

Ruoyao introduced herself. She had a two-star medal in her hand.

“Guardian of Order? What is this?”

Qin Yu frowned and asked.

“This is a huge guild, and it can be considered the largest organization in the core region of the Saint Kingdom. The people here include outsiders, and of course, most of them are natives. Everyone’s wish is for the Holy Lord to appear as soon as possible to maintain the order of the Saint Kingdom and stop the chaos. Don’t you know this?”

Ruoyao said in surprise.S?arch ?ew???el. ?rg on g??gl?

“Then what kind of organization is the God Slayer?”

Qin Yu suddenly remembered the woman she met in the Treasure Repository Pavilion.

“God Slayer? Have you seen a God Slayer before?”

Ruoyao’s expression changed drastically.

“That’s the biggest enemy of the Guardian of Order Guild, and they are powerful. It’s the opposite of our guild’s goal. The God Slayers believe that chaos is the ladder. They are already the top power in this Holy Region. It’s rumored that the three strongest Holy Consciousness top-notch martial artists in this Saint Kingdom aren’t even restricted by the Order of the Saint Kingdom. They can fight against the Holy Lord’s power. Therefore, they don’t want a new candidate to be the Holy Tord-”

“Then what is the current situation of the Guardian of Order Guild?”

Qin Yu asked. He currently possessed three Hearts of Saint Kingdom..
