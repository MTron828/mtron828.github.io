Chapter 2809: One Thought Reincarnation

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“When the time comes, countless living beings from the Nineteenth Prison will

look for you. Take care.”

After saying that, Sir Dagger disappeared completely. No matter how Qin Yu called out, it did not respond. “Da*n it, nothing good ever happens when this thing appears!”

Qin Yu cursed angrily.

The Investiture of Gods was enough to give him a headache, but he did not expect to cultivate the divinity of the Nineteenth Prison out of nowhere.

Moreover, this was probably not good judging from Sir Dagger’s tone.

Qin Yu understood the principle if two men ride on a horse, one must ride behind.

Forget it. Let’s not care about this for now.

Qin Yu sighed. No matter what existence he was facing now, he was as insignificant as an ant.

He could only take it one step at a time and try his best to use this weak power of divine sense to increase his strength now.

He could only do his best and listen to God’s will.

Oh! He seemed to have caught onto something.

There seemed to be a move that he could not recall.

One Thought Reincarnation!

That was Jun Yixian’s move. He had finally found that power from his scattered memories.

Jun Yixian had once used this move to block Ksitigarbha’s attack in the ghost realm and even knocked his Judge’s Brush into the human world.

Ksitigarbha had the power of a Ghost Saint, yet Jun Yixian could block this attack with his mortal body in the ghost realm.

One could imagine how terrifying this attack was.

This move might require one to experience countless dream cycles before it could be used.

Qin Yu frowned deeply. His hand moved slightly as he tried to use the One Thought Reincarnation.

However, his divine sense was not on his body, so he was also a little confused when he used the move.

In the next few days, Qin Yu was immersed in the research of this move.

This move was related to the strength of one’s divine soul. If he could research it and match it with his soul power, his body’s self-defense would greatly improve. There might not even be many people in Dao Consciousness who could resist such power.

After trying for a long time, Qin Yu still could not recall the memory of using this move back then.

In other words, once his divine sense was no longer in his body, he could still share some of the benefits of passive improvement of his body and divine sense.

However, he could not share the memories of some active moves.

This was troublesome!

Qin Yu frowned. Under such circumstances, it was equivalent to requiring him to create a new move.

This was easier said than done. How many people could establish their sects since ancient times?

He recalled the scene of Scholar Jun Yixian using the One Thought Reincarnation in the ghost realm.

Relying on his vast power of divine sense, he pieced together the scene from that time frame by frame.

Qin Yu replayed the scene over and over again. His hands were constantly demonstrating at the same time.

“Here he comes again. Boss has been acting weird the past few days. He goes into closed-door cultivation from time to time. Is he still the same person?”

Fatty Situ gnawed on a meat leg the size of a face as if he was already used to it.

“You kid, go eat your drumstick. What are you mumbling about?”

Chang Mang was instantly enraged. He turned around and sat on Fatty Situ’s body, giving him a good beating.

Both of them had a funny personality. Fatty Situ was already used to it.

Otherwise, he would have used a magical artifact to blast him away. Although his rich family had been destroyed, he was still rich.

“Little Fatty, you won’t commit suicide, will you?”

Chang Mang suddenly asked leisurely as they lay on the lawn outside the hut.

“Haha! What right do I have to commit suicide? My stinky father entrusted everything to me. Tell me, what right do I have to commit suicide? Moreover, with Boss Qin Yu here, he will avenge me. I must kill the four people!”

Fatty Situ clenched his fists tightly. His expression was extremely malevolent.

From his attitude towards Qin Yu, one could tell he was very persistent about the feelings of recognition. How could one be indifferent to him?

Chang Mang had been afraid that Fatty would do something stupid, so he had been teasing him for no reason. Now that he saw Fatty’s expression, he could finally relax.

Although they had only met a few times, he and Qin Yu had already saved each other’s lives.

This included the fact that he had given Qin Yu the incomplete Investiture of Gods to refine without any hesitation. This was something that Chang Mang admired. The four Saints had gone all out just for this incomplete thing.

Thus, Chang Mang had already acknowledged this fatty in his heart.

“Alright, it’s good that you have this determination. But why don’t you take revenge yourself?”

“Wouldn’t it be stupid to not ride on someone’s coattails?”

“This should be the idea. It is to mix all the reincarnation memories and form a whirlpool of reincarnation memories. This should be the core idea of this move. However, one must ensure that one’s divine sense is not affected in the whirlpool, or else one will be doomed.”

After an unknown period, Qin Yu finally recovered from the deduction of Jun Yixian’s attack.

He moved his hands. The reincarnation scenes of countless people in front of him instantly intertwined.

A huge reincarnation vortex formed behind him.

Qin Yu stood in the middle.

In an instant, Chang Mang and Fatty Situ were stunned.

The complicated path of reincarnation directly sucked their divine souls out.

They did not even have the chance to resist.

Whoosh!

A divine tree suddenly appeared behind Fatty Situ. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

It was the Divine Sun Tree that had injured Lucifer previously. However, the Divine Sun Tree had become very thin.

It was not even one percent of its original size. It pulled the two people’s divine souls back.

One Thought Reincarnation!

All the scenes of reincarnation behind Qin Yu were mixed at this moment.

The entire trunk of the Divine Sun Tree bent like a fully drawn bow that could collapse at any moment.

“Oh no!”

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. He did not expect this move to be so powerful.

Even the divine souls of the two people who were so far away from him were directly sucked over. At this moment, it was already too late to retract.

God’s Space!

A figure suddenly appeared in front of Qin Yu.

She punched at the vortex of the One Thought Reincarnation. A long river of time appeared vaguely.

It fused the power of that punch with the power of the past, the future, and the present.

It completely turned into a God’s four-dimensional attack. Then it collided fiercely with Qin Yu’s One Thought Reincarnation.

Screech!

A fierce cry sounded. A dazzling golden light shone on the Divine Sun Tree.

Meng Jing’s attack landed on the vortex of One Thought Reincarnation at the same time.

Boom!

Fatty Situ, Chang Mang, and Meng Jing were sent flying backward. Qin Yu was finally able to retract the remaining power of One Thought Reincarnation forcefully.

“This is already comparable to a Holy Consciousness attack. I might be able to resist if I were at my peak, but now, I’m completely unable to do it.”

Meng Jing said with a bitter smile..
