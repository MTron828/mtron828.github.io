Jing Lu’s words didn’t shock Fang Yue.

She only covered her mouth and laughed lightly. “Jing Lu, you’re wrong. How could a person like me fall for anyone? I just feel that Qin Yu is quite useful.”

“Hehe.” Jing Lu laughed coldly.

“Fang Yue, let me tell you. It’s bad enough that Qin Yu made me kneel in front of everyone, but because of him, the Jing family was almost finished!” Jing Lu said through gritted teeth.

Fang Yue said with some surprise, “Why do you say that?”

Jing Lu said with a cold expression, “The people of the Han family almost crippled me. If it weren’t for my father’s efforts, I would have become a corpse by now!”

“Do you think I can spare this kid?” Jing Lu looked at Fang Yue coldly.

Fang Yue was dumbstruck and somewhat confused.

Back then, the Han family had sent people to kill everyone in the Divine Medicine space.

And Fang Yue was the only one who had managed to escape.

Jing Lu had almost died because of this, but he had no power to challenge the Han family. He could only blame it on Qin Yu.

On the other hand, Qin Yu didn’t take Jing Lu seriously at all.

He actually hoped that Jing Lu would come to find trouble, so he could use the Heaven Swallowing Technique to absorb him.

“Let’s go.” Qin Yu and Yao Qing began to stroll around the Herbs Convention.

Updates by

In just over an hour, Qin Yu had several hundred-year-old herbs in his hands.

He had never expected that hundred-year-old herbs could be obtained so easily at the medicinal Herbs Convention.

“Even Peach Blossom City has such terrifying resources, let alone Jingdu?” Qin Yu felt a strong sense of crisis inside.

Compared to Han Yu’s natural resources, Qin Yu was indeed too far behind.

The biggest difference between a big city and a small city was the difference in resources.

This was also the reason why countless people had racked their brains to get a foothold in a big city.

“It seems that I have to think of a way to bridge the gap between Han Wei and me as soon as possible,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He put all the herbs into his Spatial Magic Artifact and then continued to search for herbs with Yao Qing.

The area of the Herbs Convention was huge, and almost the entire village had been requisitioned.

However, after walking for a long time, they still didn’t see the so-called pharmacistS of the Divine Medicine Pavilion.

“Mr. Qin, it seems to be quite lively over there,” at this moment, Yao Qing pointed at a stall not far away and said.

He looked in the direction Yao Qing was pointing, and as expected, there were many people standing in front of that stall.

“Let’s go and take a look.” Qin Yu brought Yao Qing towards that stall.

Qin Yu released his divine sense and sensed the people who came to participate in the Herbs Convention.

Very quickly, Qin Yu felt several powerful forces at the scene.

There were at least dozens of Inner Strength Grandmasters alone!

Such terrifying power was definitely not something that Chuzhou could compare to.

“Mr. Qin, look.” Yao Qing pointed at a piece of Purple Gold Gauze Cloth on the stall and said.

This Purple Gold Gauze Cloth was shining with a gold hue, but it was extremely thin.

And there was a strange internal qi surging on it.

“What is this thing?” Qin Yu asked.

The stall owner glanced at Qin Yu and said, “This is called Purple Gold Gauze Cloth. Wearing it is equivalent to wearing a layer of armor.”

When he heard this, Qin Yu’s eyes immediately lit up.

Equivalent to armor?

To Qin Yu, the most powerful thing was his physical strength.

If this Purple Gold Gauze Cloth was added to his body, how strong would his physical strength be?

“Can I take a look at this Purple Gold Gauze Cloth?” Qin Yu asked politely.

The stall owner sneered and said, “Take a look. You can also try it with a knife.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Seeing this, Qin Yu immediately reached out and took the Purple Gold Gauze Cloth.

Then, he took out a bronze sword from his Spatial Magic Artifact, activated his inner strength, and slashed at the Purple Gold Gauze Cloth.

However, the extremely sharp bronze sword didn’t even leave a white mark!

Most importantly, after the Purple Gold Gauze Cloth was hit by the force, it instantly became extremely hard!

“This is good stuff!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little excited!

“What’s the price of this Purple Gold Gauze Cloth?” Qin Yu hurriedly asked.

The stall owner glanced at Qin Yu and said, “It depends on what you have in your hand.”

Qin Yu pondered for a moment, then took out a Foundation Establishment Pill from his bosom and said, “This pill is called the Foundation Establishment Pill. It can raise one level in the Inner Strength Master Hands realm. I wonder if it will be able to catch your attention.”

As soon as he said this, the surrounding people immediately looked at the Foundation Establishment Pill in Qin Yu’s hand.

The stall owner glanced at the Foundation Establishment Pill and sneered. “Raise the level of an Inner Strength Master Hands by one level? Who would be interested in such a pill?”

“That’s true.” Qin Yu touched his chin. To them, an Inner Strength Master Hands wasn’t even worth mentioning.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “I also have the Fasting Pill in my hand. It can raise the level of an Inner Strength Past Master by one level.”

“Increase the cultivation level by one rank in the Inner Strength Past Master realm?” When they heard this, the surrounding people looked at Qin Yu excitedly.

“Young man, do you really have a Fasting Pill?”

“If you really have it, I’m willing to pay a high price to buy it.”

“I can exchange it with hundred-year-old herbs.”

Seeing the excited crowd, Qin Yu nodded and said, “I do have the Fasting Pill, but I’m afraid I can’t take it out for the time being.”

“You’re lying, right?” Someone beside him couldn’t help but sneer.

“You want to take advantage of us with nothing? Do you think we’re all idiots?”

“That’s right. What do you mean by advancing by one level? You’re simply spouting nonsense!”

Qin Yu wasn’t angry at the crowd’s attitude.

He looked at the stall owner and said, “If you don’t believe me, you can put away this Purple Gold Gauze Cloth for the time being. In three days, I’ll bring Fasting Pills to exchange for it.”

The stall owner looked a little conflicted. He thought for a moment and said, “Okay, but you need to exchange for ten Fasting Pills.”

“Ten?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

This price was a little beyond Qin Yu’s imagination.

“Okay! Ten then!” Qin Yu nodded and said.

When the stall owner heard this, he immediately put away the Purple Gold Gauze Cloth.

“Wait.”

At this moment, a young man walked over from not far away.

He took the Purple Gold Gauze Cloth and sized it up while saying, “I’m also very interested in this Purple Gold Gauze Cloth. Why don’t you sell it to me?”

“Hey, we saw this Purple Gold Gauze Cloth first!” Yao Qing shouted with some displeasure.

Qin Yu waved his hand and stopped him while saying, “The one with the highest price will get it. There’s no point in arguing.”

The young man nodded and then looked at the stall owner.

The stall owner said, “As long as the price you offered is higher, this Purple Gold Gauze Cloth is of course yours.”

The young man smiled and said, “I can use the Replenishing Pill to exchange for it.”

“Replenishing Pill?” The stall owner frowned.

He knew about the Replenishing Pill. It was said that it could recover inner strength quickly in a short period of time, so it was considered a precious item.

However, compared to the Fasting Pill, it wasn’t as enticing.

The young man seemed to have noticed the stall owner’s concern, so he said with a nonchalant smile, “I can take out the Replenishing Pill on the spot. Compared to this gentleman’s three day delay, I believe you will make the right choice.”

The stall owner immediately frowned.

He glanced at Qin Yu and said, “If you can give me the Fasting Pills now, this Purple Gold Gauze Cloth is yours. But if you can’t take it out, I’m afraid I can only sell this Purple Gold Gauze Cloth to this gentleman.”

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly. He thought for a moment and said in a low voice, “How about this? Wait for me for an hour. I can give you one Fasting Pill temporarily.”

“Wait for you for an hour?” The stall owner seemed somewhat puzzled.

Qin Yu said with a nonchalant smile, “I’ll refine the Fasting Pill for you on the spot.”

When they heard this, everyone immediately turned pale with fright!

Refine pills on the spot? Could it be that this young man knew how to refine pills?

That young man sneered and said, “Sir, you’re boasting, right? Refine pills on the spot? Who would believe it?”

Qin Yu said with a nonchalant smile, “Whether you believe it or not, I will naturally show you in an hour.”

That young man snorted lightly. He suddenly took out a token from his pocket and said, “I am a pharmacist of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. Stall owner, you can decide for yourself what to choose.”
