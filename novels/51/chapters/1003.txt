Chapter 1004: Chapter 1,004, the Third Alchemist 

Of course, no one would believe these words.

Qin Yu lay on the bed and quietly waited for Wan Gu Qiong to leave.

However, he was slightly worried in his heart.

Wan Gu Qiong, that scoundrel, had harassed the pavilion master many times. His methods were despicable and vile, and his obscenities were endless.

If it were not for the two martial saints by his side, Qin Yu would have already smashed his dog head.

“You won’t be able to be arrogant for long...”Qin Yu could not help but clench his fists.

Zhang Yi Jiu, who was standing at the side, could feel the murderous intent from Qin Yu’s body. He ran over and muttered, “What? What are you fantasizing about again?”

Qin Yu glanced at Zhang Yi Jiu and immediately said jokingly, “I remember that when I first met you, you seemed quite coquettish. Why have you changed your character now?”

Zhang Yi Jiu rolled his eyes and said with a smile, “If you’re willing to lend me your body, of course I’m Willing.”

“What exactly is this cultivation method of yours? Why are you like a Fairy?”Qin Yu frowned.

Zhang Yi Jiu waved his hand and said, “What do you know? This is called plucking Yang to supplement Yin.”

While the two were chatting, a voice came from outside.

Then, they saw Taozi push the door open and walk in.

“He has already left,”Taozi said.

Qin Yu was delighted and immediately got up to leave.

When he walked in front of Taozi, he suddenly noticed that there was a palm print on Taozi’s face.

“What happened?”Qin Yu frowned and asked.

Taozi shook her head and said, “Nothing.”

“It must be that Wan Gu Qiong,”Zhang Yi Jiu snorted at the side.

Qin Yu frowned.

“From your tone, it doesn’t sound like it’s his first time?”Qin Yu looked at Zhang Yi Jiu.

Zhang Yi Jiu sneered, “Wan Gu Qiong is the eldest young master. He will hit whoever he dislikes. Who Dares to provoke him?”

“Enough, stop talking. Hurry up and leave. Pavilion master is still waiting for you.”Taozi urged.

Qin Yu held back his anger. He looked at taozi and comforted, “Don’t worry. Wan Guqiong won’t be arrogant for long.”

Taozi rolled her eyes and said, “Okay, I got it. Hurry up and leave. Don’t waste time.”

Qin Yu grunted and followed Taozi all the way to Pavilion Master’s building.

Pavilion master had been waiting for Qin Yu for a long time.

As soon as Qin Yu went up the building, he hurriedly ran over and said, “Pavilion Master, that Beast, Wan Gu Qiong, didn’t do anything to you, right?”

“I’m fine.”Pavilion master shook his head. “Tell me about your matter.”

Qin Yu looked left and right. After making sure that pavilion master wasn’t injured, he heaved a sigh of relief.

After saying this, Qin Yu took out the three heavenly vanilla stalks from his spatial divine artifact.

A strange fragrance immediately assailed his nostrils.

Pavilion master looked at Qin Yu’s palm in surprise and said, “This is... heavenly vanilla? You really found it?”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “I didn’t find it. It was Yan Ruoxue who sent it.”

“Yan Ruoxue?”Pavilion master’s face was even more shocked.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “Do you still remember? We discussed the Yan family’s secret realm with old Mister Yan before.”

“The Yan family’s secret realm... is it real?”Pavilion master asked in surprise.

Qin Yu nodded his head vigorously and said, “Not only is it real, but the Yan family’s secret realm is also a high-level secret realm.”

Pavilion Master could not help but laugh and said, “Qin Yu, your little girlfriend really cares about you.”

Qin Yu sighed and said, “Yeah, I didn’t expect that I would have to rely on Ruoxue to get the heavenly vanilla in the end.”

He had thought that he would no longer rely on Yan Ruoxue after he embarked on the path of cultivation, but now it seemed that this was not the case.

“Oh right, this pill recipe says that three alchemists with purple flames are needed, but with my connections, there’s no way to find the third one.”Qin Yu looked at the pavilion master.

Hearing this, the pavilion master pondered for a moment and said, “I do know an alchemist who also has Purple Flames.”

Qin Yu’s eyes immediately lit up and hurriedly said, “Where is he now? Will he help us?”

A trace of embarrassment flashed across the Pavilion Master’s eyes. A moment later, she sighed slightly and said, “I can’t say for sure, but I haven’t been in contact with him for many years.”

Qin Yu carefully observed the change in the pavilion master’s expression and said, “Pavilion master, could it be that you have a grudge against him?”

Pavilion master smiled and said, “A grudge is not really a grudge. It’s just that there was a competitive relationship back then.”

“A competitive relationship?”Qin Yu was silent for a moment before he guessed, “Back then, there was an organization that was on par with the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. In the end, the Divine Alchemist Pavilion won, right?”

“That’s right. From then on, we have never interacted with each other again.”Pavilion master nodded.

Qin Yu scratched his head and said, “It seems a little troublesome...”

“No worries.”At this moment, pavilion master changed the topic.

“I’ll accompany you.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Pavilion Master, he won’t take the opportunity to make things difficult for you, right?”

“I don’t think so,”pavilion master said.

“As long as you can successfully become a martial saint, some sacrifices are worth it.”

At this moment, Qin Yu really could not think of any other way. He could only nod his head and agree.

The two of them discussed for a moment and planned to set off the next day.

The next day, before dawn, Qin Yu and the Pavilion Master had already left the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

The two of them drove and set off on their journey.

The car sped along the road, crossing countless mountains and rivers, and headed straight for the south.

For an entire day and night, the two of them were still unable to arrive.

“Pavilion Master, how much longer?”Qin Yu asked. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Pavilion master said, “Soon, don’t worry.”

After another day or so, the car stopped near a rainforest.

Pavilion master pointed inside and said, “We can’t drive in here. Follow me. Remember, don’t say anything when you see him.”

“Okay, I got it.”Qin Yu nodded hard.

Then, pavilion master took the lead and stepped into this rainforest.

There was a dense jungle here, and rivers passed through the jungle from time to time.

The leaves rustled, as if some reptile was watching the two of them in the dark.

After passing through the jungle and stepping on the path, their clothes were wet by the rain on the leaves.

After a long time, the front was finally bright.

“This is where he lives,”pavilion master said quietly at the exit of the rainforest.

With a glance, he saw a large valley ahead.

There were a few words written on the valley: Dragon Transformation Valley.

The entire valley was filled with herbs that filled the entire mountain!

The medicinal fragrance rushed straight into his nose, and the dense spiritual Qi made the entire valley covered in a layer of gauze mist.
