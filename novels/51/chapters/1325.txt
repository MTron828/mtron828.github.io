Chapter 1326: Chapter 1,326, obtaining the Qi of life again! 

Qin Yu’s eyes immediately lit up!

Wasn’t this jade-green aura the Qi of internal Qi of life?

“Found it.”Qin Yu took a deep breath and said in a low voice.

“Found what?”Ah San hurriedly asked.

Qin Yu raised his finger and pointed not far away, saying, “The Qi of life is there.”

“Why didn’t we see it?”Ah San frowned.

“Didn’t I say that I have the desolate God’s Eye?”Qin Yu said unhappily.

Ah San coughed and continued to ask, “Then... how far is it?”

Qin Yu said in a low voice, “It’s about ten stars away.”

Ten stars away!

This number was an unreachable number for wan ‘er and Ah San.

Their bodies had already reached their limits.

If they were to travel another ten stars, they would definitely die!

Qin Yu also knew this problem. He turned around to look at the two of them and said, “Wait for me here. I’ll be right back.”

“Ah, what if that thing suddenly appears now?”Wan ‘er exclaimed.

Qin Yu looked at Wan ‘er coldly and said, “Then you can only blame your bad luck.”

Such a cold tone immediately caused Wan ‘er to be stunned.

Ah San, who was at the side, also frowned.

Qin Yu knew the doubts in their hearts, but to Qin Yu, nothing was more important than the Qi of life.

He was not the Holy Mother, so he had no obligation to take care of everyone.

“Leave it to fate, but I will do it as soon as possible,”Qin Yu said.

“If you are still alive when I return, I will give you half of the life Qi.”

Wan ‘er opened her mouth as if she wanted to say something, but Qin Yu had already walked away.

His eyes were looking straight at the life Qi, and at the same time, he was also maintaining his vigilance, afraid that he would be ambushed by that mysterious creature.

Along the way, Qin Yu’s speed was very fast, and the sound of the wind whistled past his ears.

However, this thick and heavy internal Qi did not retreat because of this.

Along the way, there were dangers but no dangers.

Qin Yu successfully arrived near the life qi.

There was not much life qi here, but there was also quite a lot. It was at least three times more than the flying spider from last time.

“Not bad.”Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief.

This was something that he yearned for in his heart, so Qin Yu’s heart was not calm.

However, he did not waste any time. He immediately took out the container and began to collect the life energy.

During this process, Qin Yu’s eyes were also looking around vigilantly, in case he was suddenly attacked.

After about half an hour, all the life energy was collected by Qin Yu into his bag, and there was a trace of sweat on Qin Yu’s forehead.

“Phew, success.”Qin Yu patted his chest.

His eyes looked into the depths again.

“Since there is life energy here, there must be more in the depths,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Unfortunately, the risk of doing so was too great. The creature in the depths could take Qin Yu’s life at any time.

“If I go deeper, I’m afraid it won’t be inferior to the demonic beasts in the depths of the Green Rock Forest.”Qin Yu thought to himself.

The heavenly demon ape he encountered last time was still vivid in his mind.

After that punch, whether he could survive or not was a question. Once he was injured, it was very likely that he would be eaten up.

Qin Yu retracted his life force and then rushed back.

He used almost all his strength to increase his speed to the maximum, afraid that something would happen to Wan ‘er and Ah San. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

At this moment, ah San was accompanying Wan ‘Er.

Wan ‘Er’s face was filled with an unconcealable disappointment.

Qin Yu’s cold words seemed to have pierced her fragile heart.

“Miss Wan ‘er, don’t be too sad. We have only met Qin Yu by chance. He has no reason to protect us,”AH San said in a rare human tone.

Wan ‘er took a deep breath and said, “Yes, you’re right.”

Qin Yu was clearly so cold, but for some reason, wan ‘er felt even more moved in the depths of her heart.

On the contrary, she did not feel anything for Ah San who was by her side.

Human Nature was cheap, and many people could not escape this law.

“Miss Wan ‘er, do you think Qin Yu left with his life force?”Ah San frowned and asked.

His words were not groundless. He was not wan ‘er, and he was not that simple.

“Impossible. Qin Yu is definitely not that kind of person!”Wan ‘er said firmly.

Ah San shook his head and said, “That may not be the case. The human heart is unpredictable. Back then, which member of the family did not respect you as a miss? But ever since you were poisoned by the Twilight Qi...”

He did not continue, but his intention was very obvious.

Wan ‘Er was also somewhat suspicious.

Her pale face was slightly sad.

After a while, wan ‘er shook her head and said, “Even if he took the life qi and left, we don’t have the right to blame him.”

“The life Qi was found by him. If he gave it to us, we should be grateful. If he didn’t give it to us, it would be reasonable.”

These words were heard by Qin Yu.

He took the life qi and slowly walked toward the two of them.

“Miss Wan ‘er, you are really a sensible girl,”Qin Yu said with a smile.

When they saw Qin Yu return, joy flashed across their faces.

“Young Master Qin!”Wan ‘er hurriedly stood up.

Ah San also asked anxiously, “How is it? Did you get the life qi?”
