1806 Taking the Opportunity to Attack

The tall mountain standing far away from the Forbidden Zone looked very much like the Venerable Fifth Mountain in Qin Yu’s hand!

Qin Yu quickly flipped the Venerable Fifth Mountain in his hand and compared it with the tall mountain in the distance.

As expected, it was exactly the same!

“Eh? What’s that in your hand?” Soon, Yang Yu noticed the Venerable Fifth Mountain in Qin Yu’s hand.

“This mountain… It’s exactly the same as that mountain!” Yang Yu exclaimed!

!!

Gu Sanchen also walked over quickly. He looked at the Venerable Fifth Mountain in Qin Yu’s hand and said in surprise, “Brother Qin, what is this?”

Qin Yu knew he could no longer hide it, so he lied and said, “This is a magical artifact that an elder in my family obtained by chance when he went out to gain experience. I don’t know why it’s exactly the same as the mountain in the Forbidden Zone.”

“Brother Qin, can you let me take a look at this mountain?” Gu Sanchen asked.

“Of course, you can.” Qin Yu did not hesitate and immediately handed the Venerable Fifth Mountain to Gu Sanchen.

Gu Sanchen took it over and studied it carefully.

“It’s actually the same.” Gu Sanchen gasped.

“If this gets out, it’ll definitely shake the entire Holy Region,” Gu Sanchen said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

He didn’t want to be exposed to the public too quickly, as that would definitely bring him trouble.

“Brother Qin, for the safety reason, please keep this a secret,” Gu Sanchen said.

“Thank you, Brother Gu,” Qin Yu nodded slightly and said.

“Brother Gu, did you manage to observe anything?” Yang Yu asked in a low voice.

Gu Sanchen smiled bitterly, shook his head, and said, “I can’t figure it out with my methods.”

“What should we do next?” Yang Yu asked.

Gu Sanchen was at a loss. After thinking for a while, he took out the rune again and summoned a clone.

However, the moment the clone appeared, it immediately burned up and disappeared without a trace.

“It seems that even my clone can only reach this far,” Gu Sanchen said with emotion.

It was indeed a difficult question of whether they should continue moving forward.

In front of them was a place where even True Saints would die. With their strength, it would be difficult for them to come out alive if they went in.

However, no one would be willing to give up just like that.

“I want to go in and take a look.” After a long time, Gu Sanchen made up his mind.

“Then I’ll go with you,” Yang Yu said.

Qin Yu remained silent. Gu Sanchen seemed to be in a dilemma, but he definitely had a supreme treasure on him that could save his life.

However, Qin Yu was different. Once he entered, he might die there.

“Jue Wu, wait for me here,” Qin Yu said.

Jue Wu glared at Qin Yu and said, “If you go in, I’ll definitely follow.”

Qin Yu had no choice but to continue walking forward with Jue Wu.

The further they went, the chill feeling became even more apparent.

The surroundings began to turn even redder and more terrifying. The mountain in the distance seemed to be so close and yet so far.

“Crack!”

At this moment, a crisp sound suddenly came from underneath the feet.

Gu Sanchen lowered his head and actually saw a skull!

His expression changed. He picked up the skull, sniffed it, and said in shock, “This… this is a True Saint’s skull!”

Gu Sanchen hurriedly looked in front of him and saw a dense pile of corpses.

The mist in the surroundings began to disappear, revealing the actual appearance of this place.

Huge corpses were hanging everywhere. These corpses looked like they were hanged by people and looked extremely strange.

The most terrifying thing was that these corpses were extremely huge. Each of them was several meters tall, like a giant!

“No, we can’t go any further. I’m afraid this is the boundary of the safe zone,” Gu Sanchen said in a deep voice.

Before they could retreat, the golem-like statues suddenly emitted a strange light!

It was as if they had resurrected, and their eyes were glaring at the three of them.

Following that, the scene in front began to change. An invisible pressure instantly crushed over!

Gu Sanchen’s expression changed drastically for no other reason than his holy robe was starting to shatter!

“D*mn it!”

Gu Sanchen didn’t dare to stay any longer. He quickly escaped!

“Boom!”

The next second, the ground beneath Gu Sanchen’s feet started to collapse, and an extremely terrifying crack was revealed!

Huge hands reached out from the cracks!

Yang Yu, who couldn’t dodge in time, was caught by the ankle.

His body was being dragged down, and it withered at a speed visible to the naked eye!

His flesh and blood began to evaporate, falling off layer by layer. It was as if nothing could stop this terrifying power, not even the holy robe. It would fall off in an instant.

It was an extremely strange power. It was neither the power of the physical body nor the mysterious spiritual power. It was like the power of laws that could disintegrate everything! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Yang Yu’s body was falling off. If he was not saved in time, he would be dead!

Qin Yu’s expression changed, and he quickly walked toward Yang Yu.

“Brother Qin, don’t be rash!” Gu Sanchen quickly stopped Qin Yu.

“I know you want to save him, but this power is too terrifying. Even my holy robe can’t withstand it. You…”

Qin Yu pushed Gu Sanchen away roughly and couldn’t help cursing, “Who the hell wants to save him!”

Qin Yu held the golden light in his hand and threw a punch at Yang Yu’s head with a bang.

Qin Yu had almost used up all his strength in this punch, which directly smashed Yang Yu’s head into pieces.

“Fortunately, I made it in time.” Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief.

This way, it would count as him killing the person, wouldn’t it?

Qin Yu quickly took out the token and looked at it.

As expected, he had obtained the points.

“Phew! It’s alright.” Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief.

No one had thought this mission would be accomplished in such a way.

Gu Sanchen, by the side, frowned slightly. He looked at the token in Qin Yu’s hand and was full of doubts.

Qin Yu knew he couldn’t hide it anymore. Thus he cupped his hands and said, “Brother Gu, I’m sorry that I lied to you. I’m not the son of an aristocratic family in Zhongzhou. I’m a Devil Hunter from Demon-slaying Peak of Thunder Courtyard.

“Yang Yu is our target this time. Rumor has it that he has a Saint Weapon, and I’m afraid I’m not his match. Therefore, I could only use this method.”

Gu Sanchen was dumbfounded. He frowned and said in a low voice, “Demon-slaying Peak? I’ve heard that the people killed by Demon-slaying Peak are all extremely evil. Many years ago, many villainous disciples of Zhongzhou died at the hands of Demon-slaying Peak.

“But… This Yang Yu doesn’t look like an evil person.”

“You can’t judge a book by its cover. Who knows what Yang Yu’s true intentions are?” Qin Yu said with emotion.

“Probably. So far, Demon-slaying Peak has never made a mistake.” Gu Sanchen nodded slightly.

If it was in the past, Qin Yu would have felt a little guilty. But now, under tremendous pressure, Qin Yu did not think about anything else. He only wanted to enhance his strength as soon as possible and catch up with the chaotic body in Zhongzhou.
