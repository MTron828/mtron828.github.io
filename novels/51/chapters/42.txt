Qin Yu’s words made Lu Sr. laugh.

He didn’t even know how many feet to dig, yet he still dared to boast?

Du Hengsheng’s expression was also somewhat unhappy. He had seen many sons of important figures who used their connections to do whatever they wanted and shot their mouths off.

Most importantly, the people around him had to play along.

In Du Hengsheng’s eyes, Qin Yu was this kind of person.

He had never been interested in rich playboys.

But now that he had a favor to ask Qin Yu, Du Hengsheng could only wave his hand and say, “Do as Mr. Qin says.”

The few of them took shovels and began to dig down.

One foot, two feet, three feet...

Soon, a big hole appeared in front of everyone.

However, other than the soil, there was nothing unusual in the hole.

Qin Yu stared at the hole, and the ominous feeling became more and more intense.

“Mr. Du, do you still want to continue digging?” A few workers wiped their sweat and said tiredly.

Du Hengsheng didn’t answer. Instead, he looked at Qin Yu and said, “Mr. Qin, do they still need to continue digging?”

“I don’t think there’s a need for that,” Lu Sr. snorted.

“Some people are taking advantage of their connections to do whatever they want. I don’t have the time to play along,” Lu Sr. said with a hint of arrogance.

Qin Yu pointed at the hole and said, “Continue digging until you find something!”

“Mr. Qin, we’ve already dug four feet, and we haven’t seen anything. Are we going to dig through the earth?” Du Hengsheng said unhappily.

“Continue digging,” Qin Yu said calmly.

At this time, Lu Sr. took a step forward and berated him coldly, “What if we can’t dig anything out?”

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “If we can’t dig anything out, I’ll eat this pile of soil.”

“Okay!” Lu Sr. waved his hand and said, “If we can dig something out, I am willing to acknowledge you as my master!”

“It’s a deal,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

They continued to dig down the ground, and in the blink of an eye, they dug another foot.

This time, even the workers were a little impatient.

“Mr. Du, how much longer do we have to dig?” A worker asked curiously.

“We can’t keep digging like this...”

Du Hengsheng waved his hand and said, “Dig, dig, sigh.”

The workers had no choice but to continue digging.

“Kid, my time is very precious. I don’t have time to play along with you.” At this time, Lu Ning snorted.

“On account of your young age, you don’t have to eat that pile of soil. But you have to remember that there is always someone better than you. Don’t think too highly of yourself!” Lu Ning waved his sleeve and turned to leave. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He just stared at the bottom of the cave.

At this moment, the workers’ shovel suddenly made a crisp sound, as if it had touched something hard.

“Mr. Du, we dug something!” One of the workers shouted.

Hearing this, everyone quickly surrounded him.

A few workers quickly took out an iron box from the cave.

“Hurry up and bring it up!” Du Hengsheng said hurriedly.

The workers didn’t dare to waste time and quickly brought the box up.

Lu Ning, who was about to leave, also stopped and turned back.

“This is it.” Qin Yu stared at the box and frowned.

“Open it,” Qin Yu pointed at the box and said.

They quickly opened the box according to Qin Yu’s instructions.

The moment the box was opened, a bloody smell assailed their nostrils.

Inside the box was a black knife with traces of blood on it.

“What... What’s going on?!” Du Hengsheng’s face was pale and full of fear.

“Get out of the way!” Lu Ning took a step forward. He reached out his hand and touched a trace of blood, sniffed it, and then his expression changed!

“This... This is a mixture of black dog’s blood and corpse oil!” A serious look appeared on Lu Ning’s face.

“Black dog’s blood, corpse oil, machete... Southwest Fury Soul Technique?”

“What a vicious technique. This... would have taken Mr. Du’s Life!” Lu Ning muttered in a low voice.

When he heard this, Du Hengsheng’s expression became even more unsightly!

“Lu Sr., who... who did this? !” Du Hengsheng asked in a trembling voice.

Lu Ning shook his head and said, “I don’t know either.”

“Then what should I do now?” Du Hengsheng, his tone filled with fear, grabbed Lu Ning’s wrist.

Lu Ning couldn’t help but laugh bitterly and said, “Mr. Du, perhaps you should ask Mr. Qin about this...”
