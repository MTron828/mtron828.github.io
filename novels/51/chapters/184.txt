Chapter 185: You Have to Pay More! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

A surge of internal qi was suddenly released!

Following which, with a wave of Mr. Zhong’s hand, the person who spoke was sent flying!

Inner Strength Past Master!

When they sensed this internal qi, the expressions of the crowd changed slightly!

They didn’t expect Mr. Zhong to be an Inner Strength Past Master as well!

They only knew that Mr. Zhong was a genius in business, but they didn’t expect him to be so powerful as well!

For a moment, no one dared to say anything!

Mr. Zhong, not saying a word for a moment, coldly swept his gaze across the crowd.

A few minutes later, Mr. Zhong stood up.

He walked to the window with his hands behind his back, and slowly said, “The Jiang family has been too low-key these past few years, and many people forgot how terrifying the Jiang family is.”

The crowd remained silent, but they felt the same way.

“In a few days, the family head will come out of seclusion. At that time, the family head will personally kill Qin Yu,” Mr. Zhong continued.

“We can also use this opportunity to announce the Jiang family’s re-emergence.”

As soon as these words were said, everyone immediately understood.

Updates by

The Jiang family... wanted to use Qin Yu to showcase their might!

They would also use this opportunity to warn everyone that the Jiang family was still the number one aristocratic family in Chuzhou!

...

Qin Yu sat on the bed. In front of him was the bronze sword and the stone statue.

“This stone statue has dense dark energy. I wonder what it is.” Qin Yu frowned.

He placed his hand on the stone statue and felt a trace of coldness.

What surprised Qin Yu the most was that there seemed to be an inexhaustible amount of dark energy in this stone statue.

No matter how long Qin Yu absorbed it, the dark energy in it didn’t change at all.

“How strange.” Qin Yu touched his chin and felt puzzled.

The bronze sword and this stone statue was one dark energy and positive energy.

When the dark energy and positive energy fused, they would emit bursts of explosive sounds. It was obvious that they were mutually repelling each other.

“Fusing dark energy and positive energy is definitely not an easy task,” Qin Yu lamented.

He tried many times, but he was unable to fuse them.

After that, Qin Yu put away the two sacred objects. Then, he closed his eyes and prepared to break through.

This was the first time Qin Yu had tried to break through by relying on dark energy.

Therefore, Qin Yu looked extremely solemn.

However, at this moment, Qin Yu’s phone suddenly rang.

He picked up the phone and saw that it was an unknown number.

Suspicious, Qin Yu picked up the phone.

As soon as the phone was picked up, he heard the other party say with some anger, “Doctor Qin, didn’t you say that you would call me today?”

Qin Yu froze for a moment, then he remembered the masked woman from yesterday.

“I’m sorry. I forgot,” Qin Yu said apologetically.

The masked woman on the other end said, “Are you free now? I’m in the cafe downstairs of your hotel.”

“Okay, I’ll be right down,” Qin Yu agreed.

After hanging up the phone, Qin Yu walked to the cafe.

The masked woman sat in a private room. When Qin Yu entered the room, he saw a woman with smooth skin and soft hands. She was drop dead gorgeous.

However, Qin Yu didn’t show much surprise. Instead, his expression was calm.

“Tell me, what disease do you need me to treat?” Qin Yu went straight to the point.

The masked woman didn’t answer. Instead, she said angrily, “Don’t you know me?”

“I do. Aren’t you the masked woman from yesterday?” Qin Yu answered truthfully.

The masked woman was so angry that her chest heaved up and down! Masked woman? This was how he addressed her?

“You really don’t know me?” The masked woman didn’t seem to believe it.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “I see. You want me to take a look at your head, right? No problem, as long as you give me the money.”

“I...” The masked woman almost lost it.

“I covered my face yesterday. Don’t you know why?” The masked woman said with displeasure.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Isn’t it because you’re afraid of the Jiang Family?”

The masked woman was speechless.

She took out her phone and pointed at the screen while saying, “Look, open your eyes wide and see! This is the cover of a fashion magazine, and this is a super model competition cover. These two are both me, but you don’t know me?!”

Looking at the phone screen, Qin Yu suddenly understood and said, “I know!”

The masked woman smiled and said proudly, “How could anyone not know me?!”

“You sell clothes, right?” However, Qin Yu’s next sentence almost made the masked woman lost it!

” ... Forget it.” The masked woman seemed to have given up.

She simply made a self-introduction.

After the introduction, Qin Yu learned that the masked woman’s name was Yang Jing. Not only was she an international model, but she was also an A-list celebrity in the country.

After Yang Jing’s introduction, she said somewhat proudly, “I’m also a singer, an actor, and a businessman. How am I? Amazing, right?”

Qin Yu said apologetically, “Sorry, I don’t pay attention to celebrities, so I’ve never heard of you.”

Yang Jing grumbled unhappily, “What a straightforward man.”

“Miss Yang, why are you looking for me?” Qin Yu started to get impatient.

Hearing this, Yang Jing said in a sullen voice, “Aren’t you able to treat people? I want you to treat my dad.”

“Your dad? What illness does he have?” Qin Yu asked.

Yang Jing said in a sullen voice, “ALS.”

“ALS?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

“This disease is an international problem. No one has ever cured it,” Qin Yu said in a sullen voice. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Hearing this, Yang Jing hurriedly said, “Yesterday, you boasted that as long as you get paid, any disease can be cured! What, are you going back on your word today?”

Qin Yu shook his head and smiled. “Miss Yang, you misunderstood my meaning.”

“ALS is an international problem. There’s no telling how many people have lost their lives because of it. It’s also a difficult problem for me.”

“So, you have to pay more!” Qin Yu said seriously.

Hearing this, Yang Jing was exasperated.

Qin Yu was really a standard money-grubber!

“As long as you can cure it, I’m willing to spend any amount of money!” Yang Jing expressed her stance.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Okay. Originally, 300 million can be used for three house calls. Now, it can only be used once. Can you accept it?”

Yang Jing couldn’t help but feel a little distressed.

300 million for one house call was really a sky-high price.

“Okay. As long as it can be cured, 300 million is fine!” Yang Jing braced herself and said.

Qin Yu immediately gave her a card number and said, “Transfer the money.”

“We’ll talk about it after he’s cured,” Yang Jing rolled her eyes.

Hearing this, Qin Yu immediately stood up and said, “Goodbye!”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around to leave.

Yang Jing immediately became anxious. She quickly grabbed Qin Yu’s arm and said angrily, “How could you do this?! Who asks for money first?!”

“This is my rule,” Qin Yu said with a nonchalant smile.

Yang Jing gritted her teeth and said, “Okay, I’ll transfer it to you. But you have to leave with me immediately.”

“Okay.” Qin Yu nodded.

The money was transferred very quickly. Yang Jing said with frustration, “Can we go now?”

“Of course.” Qin Yu nodded slightly.

“But before that, I have to deal with a few mongrels.” As he spoke, Qin Yu’s expression instantly turned cold.
