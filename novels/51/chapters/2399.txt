“Sumeru Realm!”

After the Sumeru ring absorbed the Sumeru qi, the space returned to its original state. The power of the spatial world of hundreds of thousands of kilometers combined with Qin Yu’s Chaos, Annihilation of All Things.

“Ah!”

The veins on Qin Yu’s face bulged, and the chaotic qi in his body surged into his arms crazily.

After that, he pushed the Sumeru ring out, and the world directly crashed into Yao Shan.

Yao Shan’s face revealed a look of shock. Qin Yu’s power had reached the Second Level Soul Statue. If it landed on him, he would definitely die.

The Immortal Emperor’s corpse suddenly appeared before him and punched Qin Yu again.

Divine Demonic Dance!

“Boom!”

The ground shattered, and the white clouds and stars in the distance suddenly split apart. This terrifying fluctuation even affected the stars.

“Go to hell!”

Three drops of blood essence appeared from Yao Shan’s heart and suddenly entered the body of the Immortal Emperor’s corpse.

The corpse of the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor unleashed his brute force again. Qin Yu howled as his eyes turned bloodshot.

From his spine, endless chaotic qi gushed out and entered his hands.

He pushed the Sumeru ring step by step, and the arm of the Immortal Emperor’s corpse slowly curled up.

Finally, the Sumeru Realm exploded on the body of the Immortal Emperor’s corpse.

Amidst the tremendous tremor, Yao Shan spat out blood, and his body flew backward.

Qin Yu’s body also collapsed weakly. This attack had almost drained all of his strength.

This power had reached the Second Level Soul Statue. He had comprehended it after seeing the Ni Temple of Heaven.

“Die!”

Purple Thunder Celestial Dragon!

This celestial dragon was emitting divine might. It was as if a real celestial dragon.

“Boom!”

A heaven-locking power descended from the sky, wanting to block this attack.

Yun Sen suddenly attacked.

Flower Granny suddenly appeared before this heaven-locking power and shattered it with a palm strike.

Jiang Qingfeng also stepped on an eight-trigram diagram and was about to help.

“Get lost!”

Qin Yu took out several Immortal Emperor’s divine sense restrictions and suddenly threw them at Jiang Qingfeng.

“Boom!”

The Immortal Emperor’s divine sense restrictions suddenly exploded, and Jiang Qingfeng fell onto the ground in a sorry state. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

It was the divine sense restriction that previously controlled Chang Mang and the others. Jun Yixian had left it behind after coming into contact with it.

The power of the soul exploded, and the violent soul storm entered Jiang Qingfeng’s sea of consciousness, interrupting his help.

Jiang Qingfeng, on the ground, frantically activated the power of the eight-trigram diagram to protect his divine sea.

He dared not underestimate the explosion of the Immortal Emperor’s divine sense restrictions and directly gave up on helping.

All of this happened almost at the same time. In an instant, the purple thunder dragon crashed into Yao Shan’s chest.

“Crack!”

A loud thunderbolt that could shatter mountain rocks descended from the sky. This purple hue was just a lightning conduit, and it ultimately drew down the mighty celestial thunder.”

Thousands of feet of lightning suddenly smashed onto Yao Shan’s body, and countless lightning powers instantly spread out like flowing water.

Flower Granny Qin Yu and retreated. She then set up a protective barrier in front of the people of Thunder Courtyard, preventing the lightning on the ground from breaking through.

“Boom!”

Tiny lightning bolts filled the entire world. Everyone’s eyes were flashing with a purple lightning sea world.

“It’s so scary!”

It was even more terrifying than the destructive power he had unleashed after using the Chaotic Demon Water, as expected of Dean Lei.

Yao Shan’s body was thrown out like a tattered bag, his hands hanging limp, as if he had lost consciousness.

A Supreme Elder of the Yao family caught hold of him and then frantically fled out of Thunder Courtyard.

“Let’s go!”

Jiang Qingfeng roared angrily, his face contorted in anger.

Yun Sen turned around and left, not even caring about his people.

They did not expect Qin Yu to unleash the power of the Tribulation Second Level at the True Saint Realm, which had directly broken the balance. Yao Shan was severely injured. If Lei Xin and Flower Granny went crazy, they could make one more person stay.

The Immortal Emperor’s corpse remained on the spot and seemed confused.

A Yao family’s cultivator activated the Yao family’s immortal scripture in the distance, wanting him to leave.

However, Lei Xin activated a lightning bolt to strike him and turned him into charcoal.

He suddenly appeared before the Immortal Emperor’s corpse, and his palm landed on its head.

The lightning instantly turned into an enormous cage and entered his body. After doing all this, Lei Xin sat down on the ground.

“This Yao Shan used the corpse of the Immortal Emperor to shield him. Otherwise, he would have to leave his life behind here.”

Lai Xin’s face was full of killing intent.

Flower Peak and Demon-slaying Peak suffered heavy casualties. Flower Peak even lost two of its direct disciples. This incident had already touched the bottom line of Lei Xin and Flower Granny.

“The Yao family’s celestial artifacts have been left behind here, and Yao Xi has been killed by Qin Yu. How does Yao Shan laugh again? This Yao family will also be removed from the nine great aristocratic families.”

Flower Granny’s expression was calm, but Lei Xin knew she was truly furious.

Flower Nanny treated Lu Xue and Zhao Wan Er as her biological daughters, but they died tragically in Yao Xi’s hands today.

“I’m sorry, Flower Granny, Lei Xin.”

Qin Yu stood up and said softly.

“It has nothing to do with you, don’t overthink. Everything is destined. The nine great aristocratic families and Thunder Courtyard have been at odds for a long time.”

Flower Granny shook her head and patted Qin Yu’s head.

“It’s really difficult to control this corpse of Celestial Saint.”

Suddenly, the corpse of Celestial Saint shook violently and almost broke free from Lei Xin’s control.

Flower Granny set up another restriction, and only then did it calm the corpse of Celestial Saint down.

“This corpse is the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor, and its consciousness is sealed inside. It will naturally resist additional energy. Moreover, it’s almost equivalent to a magical artifact now. Its true body can directly communicate with the sea of the Path of Heaven and absorb spiritual energy. It’s basically indestructible. If not for Yao Shan’s lack of strength, he would be invincible with the corpse of Celestial Saint.”

Flower Granny said with a frown.

“Then isn’t it a burden to us holding this thing?”

Lei Xin shook his head. He brought the corpse of the Celestial Saint, entered the mountain gate, and began instructing the Thunder Courtyard people to clean up the mess.

Now that Ruoxue was about to break through, he had to guard against sneak attacks from other aristocratic families.

Qin Yu looked at the chaotic qi in his dantian that was almost exhausted, and laughed. He was now relying on the power of his body. Even the terrifying chaotic qi of the Glazed Holy Body could not withstand such consumption.

When he arrived at the Flower Peak, he saw Yao Xi’s corpse was not damaged.

With a thought, he grabbed the corpse, and a vortex formed in his hand.

The massive energy of dead bodies from the corpse instantly entered his body and replenished quite a fair amount of his.
