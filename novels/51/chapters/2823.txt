Chapter 2824: Failure

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Within the wriggling flesh, Xiao Hai’s face was in so much pain that it turned into a mass of flesh.

Veins were constantly squirming in his veins, making him look like a ball of the alien.

He originally wanted to break down his body into the most primitive power and then try to integrate into this space to explore the secrets. However, this method was detected.

The power of Heavenly Sin’s swastika could even break down the power sealing gods here.

Although Xiao Hai had only used his weakest power, he was still detected instantly.

In an instant, the entire Investiture of Gods’ space was filled with sand and stones.

A strong wind blew on the spot.

The power of this storm tore all the living beings in the surroundings apart, including Smoker Xie. Everyone’s divine souls were instantly turned into ashes.

The entire Investiture of Gods’ space suddenly became clear when the misty dust settled.

Countless powerful divine souls stood in different directions in the endless space.

These powerful divine souls were like pillars of light that lit up the entire Investiture of Gods’ space.

These divine souls squirmed like minced meat, making the space look extremely creepy.

Then, the world in front of Xiao Hai began to shake. A tall, pixelated phantom suddenly appeared beside his pile of flesh.

As the power moved slightly, a blurry giant hand lifted Xiao Hai’s divine soul.

His divine soul kept rolling. Countless memories flowed into the giant palm in light spots visible to the naked eye.

“The giant of the Investiture of Gods!”

Smoker Xie recovered quickly. He couldn’t help but lie on the ground and tremble.

This blurry pixelated world was the controller of the Investiture of Gods.

If he were to be flagged, he would probably be in a state of living hell for the rest of his life.

What surprised him the most was that the giant had appeared because of Xiao Hai. He had seen the giant appear before.

It was a top-notch divine soul. When the Investiture of Gods was threatened, this consciousness would appear.

In other words, the power just now had already made the consciousness of the Investiture of Gods sense danger.

As Xiao Hai’s consciousness flowed into his hand, a weak swastika power appeared on the pixelated body of heaven and earth.

The strongest power of resentment in the world had been deduced in just a few seconds.

As time passed, the power became stronger.

Roar!

Xiao Hai let out a shrill scream. His twisted face was faintly visible in the storm.

This extreme pain was as if tens of thousands of needles had been stabbed into his soul at the same time.

The pain he had felt when he crossed the Dead Sea in Nanzhou was probably not even ten thousand times greater than this.

“Anyway, you can’t kill me! You can’t kill me in this Investiture of Gods’ space!”

A thought flashed through Xiao Hai’s mind.

His vision blurred and he vaguely saw another giant hand had penetrated his divine soul again.

Boom!

The pain that penetrated deep into his soul completely drowned Xiao Hai. He lost all consciousness.

“What a special energy! It’s even above the power of the Investiture of Gods in terms of energy attributes. However, this power seems to be only unleashed through some medium. If I can obtain it in addition to my intelligence, this Saint World will no longer be able to trap me.”

A human-sized pixelated person separated from the giant’s body. It did not have a specific appearance.

Its shape was also peculiar. It had the shape of a human, a dragon, and even some other strange things. However, it looked very comfortable.

In the blink of an eye, he had disappeared from the Investiture of Gods’ space.

After a few days, only Smoker Xie dared to get up from the ground.

He shook his head with a bitter smile seeing the giant controlled Xiao Hai.

“Another one!” He had seen too many powerful people fail here, so he didn’t even have the thought of trying.

“What a terrifying power! Everything is within his calculations.”

The moment Xiao Hai’s divine soul recovered, a consciousness flashed by.

Then, the giant hand crushed him again.

To be able to flash a trace of his soul power at this moment of recovery was enough to shock the world. This was because he had relied on Heavenly Sin’s transformation of his divine soul to have this energy.

One had to know that even the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals of the Primordial Chaos Era would never have the chance to wake up once this giant flagged them. Even a trace of self-consciousness would not wake up.

“It’s so difficult. How can I find that sliver of hope?”

“How did this person get out and get the key?”

Xiao Hai was torn into countless pieces again the second his consciousness came into place.

The giant behind him was like a machine that did not know fatigue. The moment Xiao Hai’s divine soul recovered, he would fall into endless torture again.

“Qin Yu, did you see that?”

“The rest will depend on you.”

Qin Yu, who was in the Investiture of Gods’ space, naturally noticed all this. However, he could not convey the memories he had seen.

This space blocked almost all information.

This information could not be shared even if it was the same soul outside.

He could only wait for Qin Yu’s one-tenth of the divine soul to enter this place again before he could obtain this piece of memory.

Outside the Investiture of Gods’ space, Qin Yu, who was rushing, did not notice the changes in the space.

This place was filled with many powerful foreign races.

Even the peak power assassin team did not dare to relax.

More alien races had awakened their peak power there. Moreover, the human race did not control the surrounding areas.

This made everyone even more fearful. Once they were dragged into battle, they would probably be exhausted to death. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

In the Eight Desolates Beast Domain, a huge bull monster walked in.

Then, it walked straight toward the bull monster in the middle. Its body was several times smaller than the bull monster that had just walked in.

However, the terrifying aura on its body suppressed the one that walked in.

It knelt on the ground and kissed the king at the middle’s foot.

This was the way magical beasts submitted.

“Jiu Mo, my king.”

A muffled sound came out of his mouth.

Jiu Mo placed a hand on the bull monster’s head before it dared to stand up.

“King, we found a group of strong humans. There are about 60 to 70 of them and almost all of them are experts who have awakened their peak power. They seem to be going to the Eight Desolates Beast Domain, but we don’t know their goal yet.”

“Inform the surrounding kings and keep an eye on them.”

A scarlet light flashed in Jiu Mo’s eyes.

Fresh blood! A large amount of blood!

Souls! Human souls!

It stomped its feet. The entire mountain where the cave was located shook a few times.

Then, he rushed toward the top of the mountain.
