Chapter 564: It’s too Late to Negotiate Now! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Hearing Qin Yu’s angry roar, everyone couldn’t help but tremble!

Qin Yu was getting closer and closer. The feeling of waiting for death wasn’t pleasant.

In the main hall, some people even wet their pants on the spot.

Soon, Qin Yu walked in.

The moment they saw Qin Yu, everyone took a step back in unison.

“Where’s Gu Canghai?” Qin Yu glanced at everyone and asked coldly.

“Sect Master... Sect Master isn’t here...” someone said with a trembling voice.

“Qin... Qin Yu, this matter has nothing to do with us...”

“Don’t kill us...”

Qin Yu glanced at them and said coldly, “Don’t worry, I won’t kill you GUYS. Tell Gu Canghai that I’ll find him very soon.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and left.

Seeing Qin Yu’s back, they finally let out a sigh of relief.

...

The news of Qin Yu challenging the Saint Confucian Sect quickly spread on the Martial Arts Forum!

“Have you heard?! Qin Yu went to the Saint Confucian Sect alone, but no one dared to fight him!”

“I heard that the Saint Confucian Sect has been sealed because they are worried that Qin Yu will come to them!”

“Not only that, I also heard that Gu Canghai has already run away!”

“D*mn, the leader of the number one sect in the north has been scared into running away?”

“The latest news is that Qin Yu has officially stepped into the Martial Marquis Realm! Gu Canghai doesn’t dare to accept the challenge, so he has abandoned his sect and ran away!”

Countless messages flooded in!

Gu Canghai looked at the messages on the screen with an extremely ugly expression.

He had never thought that his reputation would be ruined just like that!

At this moment, Gu Canghai’s phone rang.

He picked up the phone and saw that the caller was Deng Sheng. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

He hurriedly picked up the phone and said, “Deng Sheng, what’s the situation now?”

Deng Sheng on the other end said, “Sect Master, where are you? Qin Yu said that if you don’t come back, he will take over the Saint Confucian Sect. Moreover, he said that he will definitely find you and kill you personally.”

Gu Canghai’s expression turned extremely ugly.

He gritted his teeth and said, “I know.”

After he hung up the phone, Gu Canghai took a deep breath.

The hand holding the phone trembled slightly as he kept flipping through the contacts list.

Over the years, Gu Canghai had accumulated a lot of connections.

Now that Yan Sihai didn’t care about him, he could only think of ways to protect himself.

After he searched around, most of the people rejected Gu Canghai’s request.

Finally, a big shot in Cangzao City agreed.

This big shot was an important figure in Cangzao City. Although he wasn’t a martial artist, he had a powerful background and played an important role in Cangzao City’s politics.

This person was called Shen Bin. Besides being an official figure in Cangzao City, he also had relatives with powerful positions in Jingdu.

After calling Shen Bin, Gu Canghai told him what had happened.

Shen Bin was silent for a moment after hearing this. Then, he said, “I’ve heard of Qin Yu. He’s been in the limelight recently.”

“That’s right, Mr. Shen. If it weren’t for this, I wouldn’t have troubled you...” Gu Canghai said with a bitter smile.

As a Martial Marquis, he wasn’t willing to deal with officials.

Shen Bin thought for a moment and said, “I can set up a meeting and let you guys talk. As for whether it can be negotiated or not, that’s up to you.”

Gu Canghai gritted his teeth and said, “Mr. Shen, having a chance to negotiate is enough!”

“Okay, I’ll arrange a time and place.” After saying this, Shen Bin hung up the phone.

...

On the other side, Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry to leave this city.

Over the past few days, he had been investigating the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

After his investigation, Qin Yu found that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association indeed had a deep foundation.

Apart from controlling almost all the resources, they also had extremely powerful connections.

For example, Xia Hang was a puppet that was specially used to negotiate with the various aristocratic families.

Other than Xia Hang, there were other presidents that were used to negotiate with the upper echelons of Jingdu.

As for the martial arts area, there wasn’t much information about it on the internet.

“After I kill Gu Canghai, I’ll go to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association to get her,” Qin Yu said coldly.

After that, Qin Yu stood up and prepared to head to the Saint Confucian Sect again.

He didn’t want to waste any more time. Since Gu Canghai wasn’t willing to appear, he would crush the Saint Confucian Sect!

At this moment, two men in suits blocked Qin Yu’s way.

“Mr. Qin, our boss requests to see you,” the two said expressionlessly.

Qin Yu glanced at them and said, “Who’s your boss?”

“Shen Bin,” the other party said.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I don’t know him.”

The two men looked at each other and then took out their work certificates.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown when he saw that the two of them were officials.

“Shen Bin... I seem to recall that he is an important official in Cangzao City,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Even if Qin Yu had stepped into the Martial Marquis Realm, he couldn’t go against the officials.

After thinking for a while, Qin Yu nodded and said, “Okay, I’ll go with you.”

Then, Qin Yu followed the two of them into the car.

The car came to a private farmhouse courtyard.

“Go in. He is waiting for you inside,” said the two people.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He walked into the farmhouse courtyard. As soon as he entered, he saw a familiar person.

“Gu Canghai, so you’re hiding here!” Qin Yu said coldly. A murderous aura instantly erupted!

After sensing the murderous aura from Qin Yu, Gu Canghai’s expression instantly changed slightly.

He subconsciously looked at Shen Bin.

Shen Bin waved his hand and said, “You’re Qin Yu? Sit down first.”

Qin Yu glanced at Shen Bin and bowed. “Mr. Shen.”

Shen Bin poured a glass of water for Qin Yu and said with a smile, “Qin Yu, I called you here today because of the grudge between you and Gu Canghai.”

Qin Yu didn’t say a word and waited for Shen Bin’s next words.

Shen Bin said, “There is no deep hatred between the two of you. Why don’t you sit down and talk about how to resolve this matter? This is also Gu Canghai’s intention.”

Gu Canghai braced himself and said, “Qin Yu, I was also instructed by the Yan family previously. It wasn’t my original intention.”

Qin Yu glanced at Gu Canghai and sneered. “What, now you’re willing to find someone to negotiate?”

Gu Canghai said awkwardly, “I also had no choice... Qin Yu, no matter what you want, we can talk about it...”

When Qin Yu heard that, he couldn’t help but sneer. “I don’t want anything. I just want you dead!”

“Now you want to negotiate? Too late!”
