Chapter 1154: Chapter 1,154, regrouping 

Although Qin Yu’s primordial spirit was bound by this chain, making it impossible for others to cultivate.

However, this did not affect Qin Yu from comprehending the battle character formula!

Because the battle character formula was only a line of words, just like comprehending the DAO, as long as one understood it thoroughly, there was no need to rely on spiritual Qi to cultivate.

In the end, relying on others was not as good as relying on oneself, so Qin Yu still placed his hopes on the battle character formula.

It sounded simple, but it was extremely difficult to do.

It was already extremely difficult to comprehend the ‘fighting’formula, not to mention under this kind of intense pain!

Qin Yu tried a few times, but he was unable to ignore this pain, let alone calm his mind.

“Looks like I have to overcome this pain first...”Qin Yu thought to himself.

The eight higher-ups fainted from the pain many times. Their bodies were covered in sweat, and they were close to collapse.

Some higher-ups even wanted to choose to self-detonate to end the pain.

Unfortunately, under Gu Xinghe’s spell, they did not even have the ability to self-detonate.

Qin Yu tried a few times, but he was unable to enter the state.

He simply opened his eyes and looked at the eight people.

“The dignified higher-ups of the martial arts association of Jingdu have actually fallen to such a state,”Qin Yu ridiculed.

“You really brought this on yourself. You Can’t live with yourself.”

Yan Yongfu gritted his teeth and said, “If it weren’t for you... We wouldn’t have ended up like this!”

Qin Yu said in surprise, “What are you farting about? What does this have to do with me?”

Yan Yongfu opened his mouth and wanted to speak, but he fainted from the pain.

“F * ck, hurry up and say it. Don’t Play Dead,”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse.

However, Yan Yongfu did not move at all. It was as if he was dead.

“Let me die... Let me die...”some of the higher-ups cried out in grief. It seemed that they could not bear the pain anymore.

Seeing them like this, Qin Yu was overjoyed.

“It’s a pity that there’s no way to record it. Otherwise, I would definitely record it and show it to Ruoxue,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

...

At this moment, Chang Mang and the others had already escaped from the second mystic realm and arrived at the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

In order to prevent any accidents, the pavilion master took the lead and returned to the Heaven Gate, temporarily dispersing everyone.

Some chose to go to the Sheng Kingdom, while others chose to temporarily become an unspecialized.

As for the Pavilion Master and the others, they quickly returned to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

Chang Mang was heavily injured. Fortunately, he had the pavilion master to treat his injuries, allowing him to recover quite quickly.

“We have to think of a way to save Qin Yu!”Chang Mang couldn’t care less about his injuries. His face was red and full of anger.

“Who can we ask for help now? Gu Xinghe has the power of an Almighty, and no one in the world is his match. How Can We Save Him?”Chu Heng said from the side.

Hearing this, Chang Mang grabbed his collar and said angrily, “So? Then we won’t save him! If you’re F * cking scared, get lost!”

Chu Heng looked a little helpless. His skinny figure was like a chicken in Chang Mang’s hands.

“Chang Mang, don’t be anxious. That’s not what Chu Heng meant,”Yao Meng said to smooth things over.

“What the F * CK does that mean? !”Chang Mang’s eyes were bloodshot as he roared angrily.

Yao Meng smiled bitterly and said, “We have to save him, but I’m afraid we have to think of a suitable strategy. We definitely can’t go head-on.”

Hearing this, Chang Mang let go of Chu Heng.

He said angrily, “My brain is not that good. You guys quickly think of a way. If you can’t think of a way, I’ll go to the first secret realm. At worst, I’ll die with him.”

After saying this, Chang Mang turned around and went back to his room.

Yao Qing scratched her head and said, “How about I play the role of the Guardian again?”

“It’s useless.”Pavilion master rejected this idea.

“Gu Xinghe isn’t a high-ranking official. He doesn’t have much feelings for the Dao Protector.”

“Since the Dao Protector can appear once, then he might appear a second time,”Jiang he said.

Pavilion master shook his head, “I have a different opinion. Since he appeared last time in a black robe, it means that he doesn’t want to appear in person. He’s just taking advantage of the situation. This time, he definitely won’t appear.”

“Moreover... based on my understanding of him, he won’t protect Qin Yu in everything. He won’t even care about his wife,”said the pavilion master in a deep voice.

The scene fell into silence. No one made a sound.

Everyone had witnessed Gu Xinghe’s strength with their own eyes. Who would dare to go against him. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

At this moment, Gu Xinghe had regained control of the martial arts association in Jingdu.

Sitting in his former office, Gu Xinghe was filled with emotions and was extremely satisfied.

This time was different from the last time.

The last time he took control of the martial arts association of Jingdu, he was just a puppet. This time, he truly owned this organization!

Zhai Xing stood beside him, his body covered in wounds. It was obvious that he had been taught a lesson by Gu Xinghe.

“Uncle Zhai Xing, on account of your relationship with my father, I can give you another chance,”Gu Xinghe said faintly.

Zhai Xing wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, as if he wanted to ask something.

“Why? If you have something to say, just say it,”Gu Xinghe said faintly.

Zhai Xing opened his mouth and said, “Young Master Gu, You... What did you do to Qin Yu?”

As soon as he said this, a hint of anger flashed across Gu Xinghe’s face!

He slammed his palm on Zhai Xing’s chest. This palm instantly shattered Zhai Xing’s ribs!

“It seems that you are quite attentive,”Gu Xinghe said coldly.

“What kind of bewitching potion did that Kid Give You? You Don’t know who your master is, do you?”

Zhai Xing got up from the ground, not daring to say another word.

Gu Xinghe said coldly, “If not for the fact that I need manpower now, I would have killed you long ago! I’m telling you, you’d better not mention him again, or else it won’t be good for anyone.”

Zhai Xing did not say anything more, only lowering his head.

“I order you to immediately recruit troops and regroup,”Gu Xinghe said indifferently.

“Also, isn’t there a group of mighty figures who have appeared for the sake of the Holy Region? Find Them All and work for me. Otherwise, I will kill them all!”
