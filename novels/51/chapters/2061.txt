2062 Obtaining the Magical Artifact

“Don’t worry, there won’t be any problems,” Jiang He promised.

With that, Jiang He left the Mystic Realm, bringing Qin Yu along.

Although Qin Yu trusted Jiang He very much, he still had doubt in his heart. After all, time would change a person.

Moreover, even if Jiang He was trustworthy, there was no guarantee that the Jiang family would be the same.

Therefore, Qin Yu rushed to the destination, Mount Three Waters, in advance, and figured out the structure of the place and the escape route.

After doing all this, Qin Yu hid in the void and quietly waited for the arrival of the following day in the dark.

This matter was tremendously crucial. He might die here if he was not careful. Therefore, Qin Yu had no choice but to be cautious.

Time passed by, and a day passed by quickly.

It was at noon the following day.

Qin Yu was fully focused. He released his divine sense and covered almost the entire Mount Three Waters.

Soon, three figures appeared in Qin Yu’s field of vision.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and looked over carefully. He saw Jiang He leading two cultivators, one elderly and the other young, walking toward Qin Yu.

The strength of these two people was not weak. They were not inferior to Jiang He. Their appearance immediately caused Qin Yu’s expression to turn somewhat nervous.

“Why did you bring people here…” Qin Yu frowned.

He remained calm and collected, prepared to escape at any time.

Soon, Jiang He brought the two to Qin Yu’s vicinity.

“Jiang He, where is he?” the elderly man asked.

“It involves supreme bone, after all,” Jiang He said in a deep voice. “I think he doesn’t want too many people to know his identity. Let’s put down the tribulation magical artifact and leave.”

“Put down the tribulation magical artifact? Jiang He, are you crazy? That was a tribulation magical artifact! Even for the Jiang Family, it was an incredibly precious existence! What if he takes away the magical artifact but doesn’t have the supreme bone?”

The young cultivator could not help but shout.

Jiang He looked at him and said, “Don’t worry. I can guarantee he will never do that.”

Jiang He said stubbornly, “If anything happens, I will definitely find the magical artifact. Besides… the Holy Lord has made me in charge of this matter. Therefore, you must listen to me.”

The young cultivator opened his mouth and wanted to say something but was stopped by the elderly man.

“He has said so. Let’s listen to Jiang He’s arrangements,” he shook his head and said.

Jiang He nodded slightly. Then he took out the tribulation magical artifact and placed it on the ground.

“I’ll leave the magical artifact here and come back later to retrieve the supreme bone,” Jiang He shouted in the air.

“Alright, we can go now,” Jiang He waved his hand and said.

Although the young cultivator was reluctant, he still followed Jiang He into the distance.

Qin Yu hid in the dark and looked down at the magical artifact.

The magical artifact was called the Mysterious Heavenly Mirror. It was an extremely rare defensive magical artifact.

It was round in shape and had a diameter of about three feet. Its surface was dark purple, and the surface of the mirror was covered with ancient runes as if it was telling an ancient legend.

The Mysterious Heavenly Mirror shone with a mysterious light, giving off an indescribable pressure.

The Mysterious Heavenly Mirror had a legend with endless charm. Rumor had it that a Tribulation Stage cultivator in ancient times had refined this mirror to resist natural disasters and man’s misfortunes to ensure his clansmen’s safety.

This magical artifact had astonishing defensive power. It could withstand all kinds of attacks and even break some weird spells.

It was rumored that the Mysterious Heavenly Mirror had once successfully blocked the full-strength attack of an expert who was about to pass the tribulation in a fierce battle. Thus the magic and power of this magical artifact were evident.

“Jiang He is so considerate. He found me a defensive tribulation magical artifact,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Although he was looking forward to obtaining this magical artifact, he was not in a hurry to get it. Instead, he quietly watched and covered Mount Three Waters with his divine sense.

Qin Yu only slowly appeared after the internal qi of the three people disappeared.

He quickly walked to the mirror and held it in his hand.

After that, with a thought, Qin Yu took out a piece of supreme bone from his hand and threw it on the ground. He then planned to leave this place.

However, at this moment, an internal qi suddenly arrived!

This internal qi caused Qin Yu’s expression to change drastically. Without thinking, he planned to escape into the void.

Unfortunately, it was already too late. The few people who had left just now actually returned!

The leader was Jiang He!

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly. He looked at Jiang He coldly and said, “Senior Jiang He, what are you doing?” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“I thought you had already left. Why…” Jiang He quickly explained.

Qin Yu was at a loss. He was even more confused in his heart. He could not even tell if what Jiang He said was true!

Jiang He had indeed given Qin Yu sufficient time. It was just that the cautious Qin Yu had remained hidden for a long time before showing up and causing Jiang He to return with his men.

“Since we’ve met each other, let’s cut the crap and hand over the supreme bone,” the young cultivator said with an unfriendly expression.

“I’ve already put it there. It’s where the Mysterious Heavenly Mirror was just now,” Qin Yu frowned slightly and said.

“You know quite a lot. Hand over the Mysterious Heavenly Mirror as well. Don’t worry. As long as you hand over the Mysterious Heavenly Mirror, no one will know what happened today. And no one will know your identity,” the elderly man said indifferently.

Qin Yu’s expression instantly turned somewhat ugly. Meanwhile, Jiang He, who was at the side, also frowned.

“Qin Yu, hurry up and leave.” Jiang He’s body emitted a wisp of internal qi fully enveloping the elderly and young cultivators.

“Jiang He, are you crazy? Don’t tell me you want to attack us?” the elderly man said coldly.

Jiang He said calmly, “It’s you who didn’t keep your word first. Besides… Qin Yu has the Mysterious Heavenly Mirror. If you attack him, you’ll be courting death.”

“Hahaha! Jiang He, you didn’t expect this, did you? We swapped the Mysterious Heavenly Mirror ago!” the young cultivator roared crazily.

Qin Yu could not help being stunned when he heard that.

A swap? That shouldn’t be. When Qin Yu was checking the Mysterious Heavenly Mirror just now, he clearly sensed the tribulation internal qi emitting from it. How could it be fake?

The scene fell into a short silence. The elderly man, placing his hands behind his back, looked proud.

At this moment, Jiang He sighed and said, “It was not swapped.”

“Hmm?” The young cultivator was stunned and asked in confusion, “What do you mean?”

“I’ve already noticed your intentions,” Jiang He said in a deep voice. “That’s why the real Mysterious Heavenly Mirror has always been in my hands. The one you took away is fake.”
