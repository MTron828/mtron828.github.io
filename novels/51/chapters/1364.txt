Chapter 1365: Chapter 1,365, the melancholic Wen Brothers

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold, and there was an indescribable feeling in his heart.

This was definitely a good thing for Qin Yu, but in reality, Wen Wanli seemed to be prepared to not return.

“Master, you...”Qin Yu opened his mouth, not knowing what to say for a moment.

“No need to talk nonsense.”Wen Wanji waved his hand, and a thick force directly pressed Qin Yu down to sit down.

Wen Wanji didn’t say too much nonsense. He sat cross-legged in front of Qin Yu, and then a strand of spiritual sense floated up from his glabella and entered Qin Yu’s mind.

In an instant, countless messages rushed into Qin Yu’s mind.

The Wen family’s ultimate creation art was taught to Qin Yu without any concealment.

This was a very long process that required several days. During these few days, the two of them sat cross-legged on the crater of the volcano.

And Wen Da and Wen Er were just sitting by the side. If it was any other day, the two of them would have been tired of it. But today, they were unusually quiet.

At this time, the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s army had already crossed the border and was approaching da Yue.

Countless people surrounded the entire da Yue. Not even a mosquito could fly past.

The person leading the group was the first elder. He stood high in the sky and looked down on everyone, looking awe-inspiring.

And beside him was elder Bai.

Normally, he did not have the qualifications to fight, but this trip was to redeem himself.

“First Elder, is the sect master not coming?”Elder Bai stood beside first elder and tried to ask.

First Elder glanced at him and said indifferently, “The vice sect master will come. The sect master said that he must stay to protect the sect and also find out why young master left the sect.”

Elder BAI’s expression changed slightly, and he had a bad feeling in his heart.

One had to know that the reason why the young master had left the sect was because of elder Bai.

Although elder Bai thought that he had done it flawlessly, he was still a bit worried in his heart.

“If the sect master doesn’t come, can we take down this Wen Wanli? It’s said that this Wen Wanli is extremely terrifying when he goes crazy,”elder Bai said in a low voice.

The first elder looked at him coldly and said, “I think that Wen Wanli is just an empty title. I really want to see him.”

Such a big move naturally spread throughout the entire southern province.

All the forces that tried to curry favor with the heavenly cloud sect also sent people to encircle Wen Wanli.

On a mountain in the southern province.

A young man with a demonic appearance was sitting in the bamboo forest drinking wine.

A faint fragrance lingered in the bamboo forest, making people feel extremely comfortable.

“Qu Zhu, have you heard? The Heavenly Cloud sect sent a large number of people to encircle Wen Wanli this time.”A person beside him said with a smile.

Qu Zhu drank a mouthful of wine and then said with a faint smile, “It’s none of my business.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Hahahaha!”The person beside him immediately burst into laughter.

“It’s indeed none of your business, but aren’t you curious? It’s said that the leader of this team is the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s great elder. You must know that this great elder has always wanted to fight with Wen Wanji.”

Qu Zhu curled his lips and said, “I’m not familiar with them, so I can’t be bothered to ask. But I heard that Jue Wu and Wen wanji have a good relationship. With Jue Wu’s character, she will definitely make a move.”

“Hahahaha, Qu Zhu, you’re wrong again.”Someone beside him shook his head.

“I just received news that Jue Wu is in closed-door cultivation, and she suddenly left at the myriad sect meeting.”

“Yes, someone said that she found an excuse to leave because she was afraid.”Someone beside her spread his hands.

Qu Zhu shook his head and said, “Impossible. Jue Wu is crazy. She Won’t be afraid of anyone. I even suspect that she doesn’t know what fear is.”

“Maybe.”

“Sigh, Jue Wu is about to break through again. We might have to consider going into closed-door cultivation. Otherwise, we’ll be left behind by her.”

“Yeah.”

...

Time flew by. In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

On this night, Wen Wanyun stood up from the ground.

He looked at Qin Yu in front of him and said, “I’ve already taught you all of my secret techniques. As for how much you can comprehend, that’s up to you.”

Qin Yu acknowledged and then said in a deep voice, “How about... Don’t go back. Let me handle this matter.”

“You handle it?”Wen Wanyi couldn’t help but laugh.

“How can you handle it? You killed his son. He will definitely not let you off.”

Qin Yu took out the keepsake that Yan Ruoxue gave him and then handed it to Wen Wanyi.

“This is enough to make the Tianyun sect retreat,”said Qin Yu.

Wen Wentong took the token and sized it up. “What’s This?”

“It’s a token given to me by the Princess of the Yan family in the Central Province,”said Qin Yu.

“As long as I crush it, the Yan family will send someone.”

“Hahahaha!”Hearing this, Wen Wentong couldn’t help but laugh.

He stuffed the token back to Qin Yu and shook his head. “Don’t say such nonsense. Don’t worry. It’s not that easy for the Heavenly Cloud sect to kill me.”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and was about to explain when Wen Wanji waved his hand and said, “Alright, I should go back. If I don’t go back, he will find this place sooner or later.”

“From now on, none of the three of you are allowed to leave, understand?”Wen Wanji said with a serious face.

Wen Da and Wen Er’s faces were extremely ugly, and tears even appeared in their eyes.

This was their only family, so how could they bear to leave now.

Wen Wanji didn’t say anything more and turned to leave.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He wanted to break the spatial seal, but he found that the barrier here was extremely strong and couldn’t be broken.

Looking at Wen Wanyi’s leaving figure, Qin Yu felt an indescribable sadness.

“Wen Da, Wen Er, I’m sorry for what happened.”Qin Yu sighed.

The two of them shook their heads, but did not say anything.

They sat at the edge of the volcano, as if they were thinking about something.

After a while, Wen da stood up.

He clenched his fist and said, “I suddenly regret something.”

“Huh? Regret what?”Qin Yu asked.

“Regret that I didn’t cultivate seriously since I was young. At this moment, I finally understand why men always want to grow up,”Wen da muttered in a low voice.

“If I can’t even protect the important people around me, then I must be living a really cowardly life.”

Wen Er opened his mouth and seemed to have the same feeling.

Qin Yu didn’t know what to say for a moment. The environment had a great influence on people’s growth. It was common for Wen Da and Wen Er to be unwilling to cultivate.

“I hope Grandpa He is okay.”Wen da whispered.
