Burly stretched out his two palms and reached toward the old woman.

The old woman naturally wouldn’t sit still and wait for death. She snorted coldly and a pattern immediately condensed in her palms.

This pattern was extremely complex and mysterious, as if it contained some mysterious power.

The old woman raised her hand and slapped Burly’s glabella.

Burly’s palm came to an abrupt stop.

His two palms froze in mid-air, not moving at all, as if they had been suppressed by the old woman’s spell.

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. This old woman had actually restrained Burly. How was this possible.

One had to know that even a peak Martial Marquis would not be able to retaliate in the hands of Burly.

The old woman placed her hands behind her back and said indifferently, “I have to say, you are indeed quite brave, but unfortunately, it’s useless.”

After saying that, the old woman looked at Burly, her pair of black stone-like eyes flickering with an extremely strange light.

“I have to say, this corpse can be said to be incomparably powerful, but the technique used to control it is too crude.” The old woman shook her head.

Qin Yu frowned. He tried to use his divine sense to control Burly but discovered that another divine sense seemed to have appeared in Burly’s body/

This divine sense was extremely powerful, as if it was suppressing Qin Yu’s divine sense.

Qin Yu subconsciously looked at the old woman, then narrowed his eyes and controlled his divine sense to crazily surge out.

For a moment, two rays of light appeared in Burly’s body.

One was a golden ray of light, and the other was a gray ray of light.

These two rays of light represented Qin Yu and the old woman’s divine sense respectively. The two of them relied on their divine sense to fight for the control of Burly’s body.

The gray divine sense was quite powerful. It was suppressing Qin Yu’s divine sense and forcing it to retreat.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He crazily urged his divine sense, and the golden light instantly became stronger.

The old woman sneered and said, “It’s useless. You are only in the middle stage of the Martial Marquis, and your divine sense is extremely weak. It’s not worth mentioning.”

Qin Yu did not have the mood to pay attention to this old woman. He gritted his teeth and tried his best to control his divine sense.

“Ah!”

Following Qin Yu’s furious roar, the golden divine sense in Burly’s body suddenly transformed into a small golden person.

This small person had the exact same appearance as Qin Yu. His tiny golden figure clenched its fist and smashed towards the old woman’s gray divine sense.

“Rip!”

The tiny golden figure went crazy and grabbed the gray divine sense, tearing it into two halves.

The old woman’s divine sense was instantly driven out of Burly’s body, and Qin Yu took this opportunity to regain full control of Burly.

The old woman’s face turned slightly pale, and her hunched body immediately took a few steps back.

Qin Yu’s face also didn’t look too good. He had never expected that these two corpses would have such a loophole.

If he was to meet someone with a strong divine sense, wouldn’t they be able to directly seize control of these corpses?

After taking back the control, Qin Yu did not waste any more time. He immediately urged Burly and threw a punch at the old woman.

The old woman snorted coldly and said, “It’s just a corpse. A walking corpse is not worth mentioning!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

As she spoke, the old woman raised her skinny palm and directly aimed it at Burly.

It was obvious that the old woman had underestimated Burly’s strength. The moment her shriveled palm touched Burly, she was immediately sent flying.

The old woman’s expression changed slightly and she could not help but exclaim in shock, “What a tough body!”

Burly did not say anything. His huge palm grabbed towards the old woman again.

The old woman narrowed her eyes and suddenly spat out the word ‘exterminate’!

Qin Yu had experienced this technique before. It was the ‘extermination’ spell that Geng Si had used before.

However, this old woman’s ‘extermination’ spell was clearly much stronger than Geng Si’s. That huge word with rolling black waves ruthlessly pressed towards Burly.

Burly did not use any complicated moves. He raised his hand and relied on his incomparably fierce and huge hands.

His palm directly grabbed towards the huge word. Then, he placed his hands in front of his chest and the word ‘exterminate’ instantly disappeared.

The old woman’s expression changed slightly. She shot backward while mumbling something.

A moment later, a huge black snake appeared behind the old woman.

This black snake spat out its sinister tongue and its eyes revealed a terrifying gaze.

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly when he saw this huge snake.

This didn’t look like a spell, but a real large snake.

“Demonic Beast?” Qin Yu frowned slightly, and his eyes couldn’t help but contain some surprise.

This old woman actually adopted a fierce beast.

Qin Yu tried to release his internal qi to sense the cultivation of this large snake.

What surprised Qin Yu was that this large snake was actually at the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm.

One had to know that under the same cultivation, the strength of a Demonic Beast was far above that of a human.

Whether it was the internal Qi or the physical body, they were definitely not comparable to humans. This was a natural advantage.

The old woman narrowed her eyes and said indifferently, “I’ve adopted this Heaven Swallowing Python for more than 30 years.”

“During these 30 years, I’ve fed it elixirs, top-notch herbs, and even some martial artists who were imprisoned...”

“For the past 30 years, it has already reached a perfect state! Be it its body or its cultivation, it can be said to be the King of the Demonic Beasts!”

Qin Yu listened to her bragging and could not help but sneer, “That’s nice. I think that the inner core of such a Demonic Beast will be a great tonic. After I kill it, I will definitely have a good taste.”

When the old woman heard that, she could not help but laugh, “My Heaven Swallowing Python’s body is like steel. With one breath, it can destroy the world! In the past 30 years, no one has been able to hurt it at all!”

“Qin Yu, I won’t go easy on your corpse.”

After saying that, the old woman patted the Heaven Swallowing Python’s body with a kind expression.

The Heaven Swallowing Python seemed to have received an order. It shook its huge head and looked at Burly.

“Whoosh!”

In the next second, the Heaven Swallowing Python suddenly stuck its head out and charged toward Burly.

Burly did not dodge at all. He clenched his fist and ruthlessly smashed it towards the Heaven Swallowing Python.

This punch was extremely powerful. The huge head of the Heaven Swallowing Python immediately tilted backward.

Qin Yu seized the opportunity and controlled Burly to charge at the Heaven Swallowing Python.

At this moment, the huge body of the Heaven Swallowing Python suddenly swept towards Burly. Its speed was so fast that it left people speechless.

The huge body of the python quickly wrapped around Burly’s body.

Following that, the tail of the Heaven Swallowing Python began to tighten, and the gripping strength that wrapped around Burly’s body also became greater and greater.

“Just like that, bind its body until it explodes!” The old woman roared.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh coldly.

Burly was a mighty figure’s physical body. How could the hardness of his body be compared to that of a beast?

The Heaven Swallowing Python drew closer and closer. It even spat out a mouthful of black internal qi from its huge mouth.

This internal qi contained a lethal poison and was extremely stinky. Even Qin Yu hurriedly covered his mouth.

The Heaven Swallowing Python coiled around Burly for more than ten minutes, but Burly didn’t move at all and wasn’t affected at all.

“Swallow him for me!” The old woman gave another order.

At the same time as she gave the order, a trace of craftiness flashed through the old woman’s eyes.

In the next second, she raised her shriveled palm and charged at Qin Yu.
