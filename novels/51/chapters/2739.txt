Chapter 2740: Breakthrough Again

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

After entering the core region from the Ladder of Chaos, Qin Yu felt there was no limit in the universe.

This was especially true whenever he saw all kinds of power at the Endless Mine and this place.

In the Saint Kingdom where almost all the geniuses were gathered, this would make people feel even more suffocated and hopeless. As such, Qin Yu did not dare to relax even a little.

In three days, Qin Yu had thoroughly tempered his body twice.

His physical strength had increased by almost half again. His physical strength was now far above the holy energy cultivation realm.

As his body shook, it could erupt with an explosive internal qi like an ancient Fierce Beast.

It was as if he could shatter space with a single move.

His cultivation realm also jumped to Dao Realm level 9.

Even Qin Yu was surprised by this speed, but it was normal to think about it.

Below Dao Realm level 9 was the accumulation of holy energy.

His body was already as strong as a demonic beast. His divine soul was also sufficiently solid.

During the three years of the dream realm, not only did his internal qi of the Dao of Dreams had strengthened.

His divine soul had also become stronger along with it. Therefore, Qin Yu was not surprised by his breakthrough this time.

His main goal now was to obtain the power of the peak. This was a qualitative leap.

Three days had passed and the trading market would open again today. He could go and look for that old man.

Judging from the old man’s appearance earlier, he seemed to have more in-depth information.

However, he almost did not open his eyes to look at Qin Yu because his mark was only in its first form.

Qin Yu pushed open the door. At this moment, the air was emitting a strange smell.

“Sir, you’re actually fine!”

The waiter stared at Qin Yu in surprise.

Originally, he had planned to enter the room to collect Qin Yu’s corpse if he did not come out today.

“How many people have died in the past three days?”

Qin Yu frowned and asked.

“Close to 100,000 people. Corpses are everywhere inside and outside the city. Many people flee like crazy, but those with the mark can’t escape. It seems that this is about the Heavenly Sin. There are all kinds of rumors. Why must you go to that ominous place? With this killing speed, I’m afraid all those with the mark can’t escape in a few days.”

The waiter shook his head with a sorrowful look. However, Qin Yu saw the teasing look on his face.

“It’s too terrifying.”

Qin Yu chuckled and ignored the waiter.

As the lowest class in Lingxu City, it was rare to see people of the mighty and higher class reveal a panicked look. This gave him a sense of satisfaction.

Qin Yu ignored the waiter. He directly left and headed towards the trading market.

The change in the mark made him feel uneasy. He also wanted to know the secret of the Tomb of Heavenly Sins.

Qin Yu walked on the streets of the city. In three days, he could vaguely smell the stench of rotting corpses.

Vultures, Three-Eyed Crows, and other corrosive Demonic Beasts circled in the air.

Some of the Demonic Beasts used their sharp claws to grab a corpse and instantly flew far away.

At this moment, the city was shrouded in a heavy atmosphere. There were already people cleaning up the corpses on the streets.

Moreover, every street was patrolled by soldiers with powerful auras. From the mottled bloodstains on the ground, it could be seen that many battles had happened here in the past few days.

Qin Yu thought about it and felt that it made sense.

Since so many people had died, the wealth they left behind would cause everyone to snatch it. Nearly 100,000 people had died. Lingxu Ciyu was considered to control this kind of chaos very well.

Along the way, it was obvious that there were fewer people.

However, Qin Yu could still see a crazy crowd in the trading market. Moreover, what surprised him was that many people with powerful internal qi were here. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Using his divine sense, he sensed that there were close to a few thousand Dao Realm level 9 people here.

Many experts had cultivated to the peak.

This was a shocking number. Even Qin Yu felt his scalp go numb.

“It looks like many heaven-defying opportunities are hidden in the Tomb of

Heavenly Sins. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have attracted so many people.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. It seemed that his information was far behind these people.

He came to the place where he had traded with the old man, but the place was empty.

There was already another person there. The old man was not there.

Did the old man die?

Qin Yu frowned.

He suddenly took out the communication talisman. This was the one he had left for Wang Da previously. It was just the right time to contact him.

Qin Yu crushed the communication talisman. Not long after, Wang Da’s figure appeared in front of him.

“Da*n it! Brother, you survived! Awesome! Has Heavenly Sin not found you yet? You’re so lucky!”

Wang Da was a little dumbfounded as if he had seen a ghost.

“Where is the old man? I have an agreement with him before, and now I have something to ask him.”

Qin Yu asked with a smile.

“Alright! Alright! Your matter is my matter. It’s just that he has an important guest today, so he might not have time to see you. Why don’t you come back tomorrow?”

Wang Da seemed to have remembered the old man’s instruction and quickly explained it to Qin Yu.

“Take me there. When the time comes, just help me pass a message. I’ll leave if he doesn’t want to see me.”

“Alright.”

At this point, Wang Da couldn’t refuse anymore.

The old man was not at the trading market at the moment. Wang Da brought Qin Yu and slowly shuttled through the crowd towards the periphery.

“Brother, it looks like you want to get your hands on the Tomb of Heavenly Sins. I don’t recommend you to go there. This place is too strange. Don’t look at the imposing manner of these people. Less than ten percent of them may survive after entering the Tomb of Heavenly Sins. Is it worth taking such a risk in such a dangerous place?”

Wang Da was very familiar with the old man and probably guessed that Qin Yu was interested in this tomb.

“Wang Da, do you have a deep understanding of the Tomb of Heavenly Sins? Can you tell me?”

“It’s not just deep, I’ve even personally experienced it. This cursed tomb has already appeared for the second time. The first time was in the year 1728 of the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom. At that time, Heavenly Sin appeared and nearly 500,000 cultivators from the Saint Kingdom entered. In the end, less than 100 people came out. Out of these 100 people, three became the second in this Sacred Kingdom, the three Holy Consciousness top-notch martial artists. The remaining 100 people almost all became top-notch cultivators.” Qin Yu’s scalp went numb when he heard that. 500,000 for only 100 people?

The death rate was almost 100%.

“Just what is inside that could kill so many people? It was nearly 500,000 cultivators. Even a god would probably die from exhaustion.”

“I’m not sure about that, but there must be a great opportunity hidden there.

Otherwise, it wouldn’t have caused such a huge commotion..”
