Chapter 529: Yan Yunheng VS Yan Sihai Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Xiao Yu’s words stunned Qin Yu.

It had to be said that her suggestion might really be useful. After all, dual cultivation with a pure dark energy body could indeed bring miraculous results.

Unfortunately, Qin Yu couldn’t accept this at all.

He couldn’t accept anyone other than Yan Ruoxue.

“Alright, I have my own way.” Qin Yu stroked Xiao Yu’s head.

Xiao Yu said anxiously, “I’m not only doing this just for you, but also for Ruoxue.”

Qin Yu said in a low voice, “Think about it. If Ruoxue finds out about this, how will you face her in the future?”

Xiao Yu was instantly speechless. For a moment, she had nothing to say.

“Don’t worry. It’s just Han Wei. I’ll personally wring his head off tomorrow,” Qin Yu said with a smile while pretending to be relaxed.

After saying this, Qin Yu dragged Xiao Yu out of the room.

“Goodbye.” Before leaving, Qin Yu looked at everyone and cupped his hands.

“Mr. Qin, I’ll go with you,” Yao Qing said.

Qin Yu glanced at him and shook his head. “It’s useless even if you go. You should stay.”

“No, no matter what, I have to go with you!” Yao Qing said seriously.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and nodded. “Alright then. I also happen to lack a companion.”

After saying goodbye to everyone, Qin Yu went to the airport and headed to Jingdu!

This was the third time Qin Yu had come to Jingdu!

And this time, his state of mind was completely different from the previous two times.

While standing at Jingdu Airport, Qin Yu had an indescribable feeling inside.

There was nervousness, worry, and excitement...

But in the end, all his emotions turned into calmness.

“Mr. Qin, where are we going now?” Yao Qing followed and asked.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “To the Yan family’s home!”

Qin Yu was worried about Yan Ruoxue’s safety. Now that he had come to Jingdu, Qin Yu naturally had to go to the Yan family’s home first!

“To the Yan family’s home?” Yao Qing seemed to be a little worried.

One had to know that the Yan family had always wanted to get rid of Qin Yu. if he took the initiative to go to the Yan family, wasn’t that suicide?

“If you’re afraid, then find a place to stay first,” said Qin Yu.

Yao Qing smiled bitterly and said, “My life isn’t that significant. What’s there to be afraid of?”

“Then let’s go.”

The two of them took a taxi and headed straight for the Yan family’s manor!

At this moment, at the solemn entrance of the Yan family’s manor, there was an uninvited guest.

He looked young, only in his thirties or forties, but his expression and posture were that of an old man.

This person was none other than Yan Yunheng, who had changed his body!

No one had expected that Yan Yunheng would come to the Yan family’s manor!

Ever since Old Mister Yan “died”, the Yan family had changed its staff inside and outside.

Even the bodyguards at the door had changed into people who looked familiar.

Yan Yunheng stood there as he looked at the Yan family’s manor that he was most familiar with, and there was an indescribable sense of anguish inside.

“Huh? That person seems a little strange.” Soon, someone noticed Old Mister Yan.

“I keep feeling that he seems to be a little similar to the person that President Yan wants to capture,” another bodyguard said softly.

The two of them looked at each other, then suddenly took a step forward and grabbed Old Mister Yan!

Yan Yunheng frowned slightly. He looked at the two of them coldly and said, “What do you want to do?!”

“What do we want to do? Don’t think that I don’t know that you have offended Mr. Yan. Mr. Yan has always wanted to capture you!” The bodyguard said fiercely.

“I didn’t think that you would dare to come to the Yan family’s manor.”

The two of them grabbed Old Mister Yan and walked into the manor.

They imprisoned Old Mister Yan in the living room. Then, they took out their phones and called Yan Sihai!

Not long after the phone call, Yan Sihai rushed to the Yan family manor!

“Where is he?!” Once the door was pushed open, Yan Sihai said anxiously.

“Mr. Yan, he is here.” The bodyguard hurriedly pointed to Yan Yunheng beside him.

Their eyes met, and the atmosphere instantly froze.

Yan Sihai stared intently at Yan Yunheng, and his expression was a little strange. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Even though Old Mister Yan had a new body, his expression and gaze were no different from Old Mister Yan’s!

This made Yan Sihai feel a chill down his spine, and a trace of fear rose from the bottom of his heart!

Even though Yan Sihai had become the new head of the Yan family, he was still nervous in front of his father!

“You guys can go out first.” Yan Sihai frowned, then waved his hand.

After sending the two bodyguards away, Yan Sihai sat opposite Yan Yunheng.

When father and son met, they weren’t as happy and excited as they had imagined. Instead, they were a little nervous.

“Yan Sihai, you’re quite something,” Yan Yunheng said coldly.

Yan Sihai’s expression changed again. He opened his mouth, but realized that he couldn’t bring himself to talk.

“What? You took over the Yan family and now, you want to get rid of me?” Yan Yunheng asked coldly.

Yan Sihai gritted his teeth. He knew very well that there was no turning back. It was useless to say anything now.

Therefore, Yan Sihai mustered up his courage and looked at Yan Yunheng.

“Dad, if you’re willing, I can let you enjoy your days and give you everything you want!” Yan Sihai said through gritted teeth.

“You can continue to stay in the Yan family’s manor. I’ll get someone to send whatever you want to you! But... you can’t stay outside!”

When Yan Yunheng heard this, he couldn’t help but laugh and said, “You want to put me under house arrest? Just like how you put Ruoxue under house arrest?”

“Dad, this is for everyone’s good,” Yan Sihai said coldly.

“You’re already so old. Why not enjoy your old age?”

Yan Yunheng sneered. “So, I have to thank you for your charity?”

Yan Sihai fell into silence.

He sighed, then said slowly, “I knew you wouldn’t agree. With your temper, you won’t forgive me either, right?”

Yan Yunheng narrowed his eyes and said, “Why are you so anxious? I can live for three years at most. In three years, control of the Yan family will be passed to you.”

“Passed to me? Who knows? What if you pass it to Yan Ruxue?!” Yan Sihai gnashed his teeth and said.

He suddenly stood up and berated, “The Yan family must be mine. It can only be mine! Besides me, no one else has the right to touch it!”

“For control over the Yan family, I can give up everything! I can also get rid of everything! Even you!”

Yan Yunheng looked at Yan Sihai and said in a deep voice, “You have been blinded by the pleasure brought by power.”

How could Yan Sihai listen to his words? He looked at Yan Yunheng coldly and said, “Dad, I will give you two options. Either you stay in the Yan family manor and enjoy your old age, or...”

He didn’t finish his words, but the meaning was very obvious.

“You should know clearly that as long as I don’t admit that you’re Yan Yunheng, then you’re not.” Yan Sihai lit a cigar.

Yan Yunheng sneered and said, “You’re threatening me? You’re too naive. If you’re really that ruthless, then make your move.”
