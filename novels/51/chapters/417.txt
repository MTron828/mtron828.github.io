Jing Lu didn’t panic at all. It was obvious that he had already prepared a countermeasure.

He smiled bitterly and said, “Mr. Qin, do you think I have the qualifications to come and seek revenge on you?”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. Although what Jing Lu said made sense, Qin Yu didn’t believe his words at all.

How could someone forget about their father getting killed and ask for peace with the killer?

“Why did you come to me?” Qin Yu asked.

Jing Lu said in a deep voice, “Mr. Qin, I want to ask you for a favor.”

“You want to ask me for a favor?” Qin Yu looked at Jing Lu with a nonchalant smile.

Jing Lu nodded and said, “Yes, I found a secret realm in Yunchuan City, but I don’t dare to enter alone.”

“I don’t know anyone in Yunchuan City. I heard that you came to Yunchuan City, so I came to ask you for a favor.”

Jing Lu’s face was full of sincerity, and it didn’t seem fake.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment and said, “Okay, where is it?”

“It’s by the river!” Jing Lu said hurriedly.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Then don’t waste time. Lead the way.”

Jing Lu was overjoyed!

He never thought that Qin Yu would be so gullible!

“Mr. Qin, please follow me!” Jing Lu cupped his hands and said.

The two of them left the hotel and rushed to the riverside. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

On the way, Qin Yu and Jing Lu didn’t say anything, which made the ambience a bit awkward.

Half an hour later, the car stopped by the roadside.

Jing Lu got out of the car eagerly and opened the door for Qin Yu.

“Mr. Qin, it’s right in front!” Jing Lu said while holding back his excitement.

Qin Yu got out of the car.

He looked at Jing Lu and said with a half-hearted smile, “Jing Lu, sometimes people only have one chance to choose. The slightest carelessness will lead to eternal damnation. Have you thought it through?”

Jing Lu was stunned.

There was obviously a hidden meaning in his words.

“Mr. Qin, I don’t understand what you said,” Jing Lu braced himself and said.

Qin Yu patted Jing Lu’s shoulder and said, “Let’s go.”

Jing Lu didn’t say anything more. He led Qin Yu to the riverside.

The two of them were getting closer to the riverside. At this time, Qin Yu stopped again.

Staring at the river, Qin Yu said indifferently, “I killed your father. I can understand if you want revenge. So, I won’t kill you this time.”

Jing Lu was stunned, and his expression suddenly changed!

Qin Yu... had seen through the ruse long ago?

“You...” Jing Lu looked at Qin Yu in horror, and his body couldn’t help but tremble.

“You can go,” Qin Yu said nonchalantly.

Jing Lu gritted his teeth and immediately ran away.

The moment Jing Lu ran away, the people hiding in the dark also walked out one after another.

Looking at the dozen or so figures that suddenly appeared by the river, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

“Qin Yu, you’re finally here! We’ve already made thorough preparations to kill you!”

Before Qin Yu could walk over, he saw a young man wearing a green hat shouting desperately.

Elder Zhuo and the others’ expressions turned somewhat ugly.

“Idiot, do you want him to run away?!” Elder Zhuo said angrily.

How could Yao Qing have the mood to pay attention to Elder Zhuo? He shouted desperately inside, “Mr. Qin, run quickly!”

Qin Yu looked at the youth with the green hat with some surprise.

Wasn’t this Fang Yue’s hat? How could it be on his head?

“Come face your death!” Seeing that Qin Yu had no intention of leaving, Yao Qing shouted again.

“Shut the f * ck up!” Elder Zhuo raised his hand and slapped Yao Qing’s mouth!

Yao Qing’s expression was extremely ugly. He couldn’t help but curse inside.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He slowly walked in front of everyone with his hands behind his back.

More than ten people quickly surrounded Qin Yu in the middle.

“Qin Yu, you’re finally here.” Elder Zhuo stroked his beard and said indifferently.

Qin Yu sized them up and sneered. “More than ten peak Inner Strength Grandmasters aren’t enough to kill me.”

“Hehe, Qin Yu, don’t be so arrogant. Since we dared to ask you out, we naturally have full confidence.” Elder Zhuo said with a nonchalant smile.

“That’s right! Among us, there are Formation Masters, Cross-training Grandmasters, and Inner Strength Grandmasters. Killing you is no problem!” Yao Qing roared again.

This time, Qin Yu also realized something strange.

This kid seemed to be threatening him, but in fact, every word he said was to inform him.

“Shut up!” Elder Zhuo glared at Yao Qing fiercely.

After saying that, Elder Zhuo looked at Qin Yu and said coldly, “Qin Yu, we don’t want to make enemies. If you’re willing to hand over the Meridian Circulation Technique, we can consider sparing your life.”

“Meridian Circulation Technique?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows, then shook his head and said, “Then I can only say I’m sorry, because... there was no Meridian Circulation Technique on the stairway to heaven.”

“You’re full of nonsense,” Elder Zhuo said coldly.

“Are you going to hand it over or not?!” Someone shouted loudly.

Qin Yu spread his hands and said, “I don’t have it. How do you want me to hand it over?”

Qin Yu paused for a moment and continued, “Oh, of course. Even if there is, I won’t give it to you.”

“Qin Yu still dares to be so arrogant at the end of his life!” Elder Zhuo said coldly.

“Since you’re unwilling to cooperate, then don’t blame us for being merciless!”

Elder Zhuo’s internal qi was the first to erupt!

After sensing Elder Zhuo’s internal qi, a hint of enthusiasm flashed across Qin Yu’s eyes!

Elder Zhuo’s internal qi was a few times stronger than that of an ordinary pinnacle Inner Strength Grandmaster!

Following which, the internal qi of the other ten plus people also erupted!

In an instant, the river water began to surge wildly while stirring up raging waves.

The trees on both sides were cut in half by this internal qi!

“I’ll give you one last chance. Hand it over!” Elder Zhuo said coldly.

Qin Yu sneered. “Are you deaf? You’re already old enough to retire. Why are you here to dig your own grave?”

“Okay!” Elder Zhuo didn’t say anything more.

Just as he was about to give the order to “attack together”, Yao Qing suddenly shouted from the side, “Qin Yu, you don’t have to be arrogant! You just have a strong physical body. Master Huang Biao’s physical body is far superior to yours!”

Huang Biao, who was already ready to make a move, felt very smug.

Huang Biao immediately took a step forward, then waved his hand and said, “Elder Zhuo, let me handle this kid myself.”

Elder Zhuo frowned and said, “Huang Biao, have you forgotten what I said?!”

Huang Biao snorted coldly and said, “Everyone says that Qin Yu’s body is unparalleled. I, Huang Biao, am not convinced! If I can’t exchange a few moves with him today, I will never be satisfied!”
