Chapter 177: Resounded Throughout Chuzhou! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Mr. Wu’s expression became even more unsightly.

He had personally gone to look for Jiang Haoran, so he naturally knew Jiang Haoran’s attitude.

And several years ago, Jiang Haoran had already become a powerful figure in Chuzhou.

At that time, Qin Yu was still a nobody.

“This time, I’m afraid Qin Yu has really met with a tough opponent.” Mr. Wu sighed.

Just as everyone was worried, the door was suddenly opened.

Everyone turned around and saw Qin Yu carrying a box while walking in from the door.

“Why are all of you here?” Qin Yu said with a smile.

Seeing Qin Yu’s relaxed expression, everyone couldn’t help but be stunned.

“Qin Yu, you... are you okay?” Mr. Wu was the first to stand up and looked at Qin Yu with a face full of shock.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “What could have happened to me?”

Everyone was even more confused.

Could it be that... Qin Yu and Jiang Haoran had reconciled?

“Did Jiang Haoran not come to you?” Wei Ming frowned and said.

“Yes, he did.” Qin Yu shook the herbs in his hand.

Then he smiled and said, “If he didn’t come to me, where did I get this herb?”

Wei Ming immediately swallowed hard.

“You mean... this herb was given to you by Jiang Haoran?” Wei Ming said in a daze.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “This should have been mine to begin with. I just took it back.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Jiang Haoran is actually that compromising?” Mr. Wu felt that it was somewhat unbelievable.

He clearly remembered that Jiang Haoran had said that he wouldn’t let Qin Yu off the hook, so how could he have sent the herb?

“Mr. Wu, you are wrong.” At this moment, Qin Yu couldn’t help but shake his head.

“That rascal was too uncompromising. If I didn’t teach him a lesson, he wouldn’t have given the herb to me.” Qin Yu snorted coldly.

Teach him a lesson?

Upon hearing this, everyone gasped!

“What did you do to Jiang Haoran?” Mr. Wu asked anxiously.

Qin Yu glanced at Mr. Wu and said coldly, “He’s heavily injured. But with the Jiang family’s power, he won’t die.”

Mr. Wu’s expression instantly turned extremely ugly!

Wei Ming even sat down on the bed.

“You actually hit Jiang Haoran?” Mr. Wu grabbed Qin Yu’s arm tightly.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “He attacked first.”

Mr. Wu hurriedly took out his cell phone and made a call.

After he confirmed that Qin Yu wasn’t lying, Mr. Wu’s expression instantly turned pale!

“Qin Yu, leave Chuzhou immediately. I will arrange a place for you to go. Leave immediately!” Mr. Wu said anxiously.

“Leave? Leave for where? Why do I have to leave?” Qin Yu shook his head.

Mr. Wu said anxiously, “I don’t know how to explain it to you. In short, the Jiang family isn’t someone you can offend!”

“I’m not leaving.” Qin Yu refused without even thinking about it.

“Let’s not talk about whether I can leave or not. Even if I do, the Jiang family will shift their target to the people around me.” Qin Yu shook his head.

“I’ll take responsibility for what I’ve done.”

Mr. Wu said anxiously, “Now isn’t the time to tough things out! Listen to me and leave immediately!”

However, Qin Yu stubbornly refused to leave.

After the battle with Jiang Haoran, Qin Yu discovered something.

The strength of cultivation and martial arts were far from the same level.

Even though Qin Yu seemed to be on the level of a second-level Inner Strength Master Hands, he didn’t feel the slightest bit of pressure when facing an Inner Strength Past Master.

This meant that cultivation and martial arts were on completely different levels even at the same level.

Therefore, Qin Yu wasn’t afraid of the Jiang family at all.

“Mr. Wu, Wei Ming, thank you for your kindness, but you don’t have to worry,” said Qin Yu.

“If you are afraid of being implicated by me, you can cut ties with me as soon as possible,” said Qin Yu with a smile.

Mr. Wu said with a sullen expression, “Qin Yu, what are you saying?! Although I can’t do anything to the Jiang family, the Jiang family can’t do anything to me either!”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and nodded. “That’s true.”

Then, Qin Yu looked at Wei Ming.

“Wei Ming, you’re different from Mr. Wu. You’re a businessman with many scruples. If you leave now, I won’t blame you,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

Wei Ming’s expression was dark, and he had mixed feelings.

Just as Qin Yu said, if the Jiang family wanted to take revenge, those who were too close to Qin Yu would definitely be implicated.

However, Wei Ming was thinking of the big picture at this moment.

When he first met Qin Yu, Qin Yu was only slightly stronger than Liu Shihui.

However, in this short month, not only did Qin Yu defeat an Inner Strength Past Master, but he even defeated the Eldest Young Master of the Jiang family easily.

This rate of growth could only be described as terrifying!

If Qin Yu was given enough time, the Jiang family wouldn’t even be worth mentioning!

“I’m not leaving.” Wei Ming made a decision.

He looked at Qin Yu and said half-jokingly and half-seriously, “If you become rich in the future, I don’t want to regret today’s decision.”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “Maybe I’ll die tomorrow. Then you’ll lose the bet.”

“So you have to ensure that you stay alive.” Wei Ming laughed, and Qin Yu also laughed.

“Then, according to the original plan, you will accompany me to look for herbs tonight,” said Qin Yu.

Wei Ming nodded and said, “Okay, see you tonight.”

On the other side, Jiang Haoran was sent back to the Jiang family.

His body was full of injuries. His ribs were broken, and even his internal organs were ruptured!

When he saw Jiang Haoran, who was covered in blood, the butler’s expression was extremely cold!

“Mr. Zhong, save my brother!” Jiang Yu said anxiously.

Mr. Zhong took a deep breath and said, “Second Young Master, what happened? How did Eldest Young Master become like this?”

Jiang Yu gritted his teeth and said, “It was all Qin Yu’s fault!”

“Qin Yu?” Mr. Zhong’s expression changed slightly.

Qin Yu actually had such abilities?

“This matter must be kept a secret. It can’t be spread.” Mr. Zhong took a deep breath.

Once it was spread, the reputation of the Jiang family would be ruined.

Not only that, but the prestige that the Jiang family had established in Chuzhou for many years would probably collapse as well.

But the truth would eventually come out.

That afternoon, after Jiang Haoran was resuscitated, his life was finally saved.

Unfortunately, Jiang Haoran fell into a coma and became a vegetable.

Although the Jiang family tried their best to suppress the news, this matter still spread throughout Chuzhou.

For a moment, everyone was talking about this matter.

Qin Yu once again became a sensation!

His name was a household name in Chuzhou!

In the dark, Yan Jiang was sitting in a car with a confused expression.

Last time, at Yan Ruoxue’s strong request, Yan Jiang was kept in Chuzhou by the Yan family and was in charge of secretly observing Qin Yu.

Therefore, he found out about this matter soon.

“Jiang Haoran was actually beaten into a vegetable by Qin Yu?” Yan Jiang was extremely bewildered.

How could this kid improve so quickly? Moreover... Qin Yu looked unscathed!
