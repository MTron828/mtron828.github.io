Ye Nan clearly did not expect Qin Yu to really bring back the inner core. His face was filled with surprise, but hidden within the surprise was an unspeakable treachery.

Ye Nan played with the inner core and carefully sized it up, then said, “What a pity, this is not the inner core that I wanted.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He had long guessed that ye Nan would say this, but when he heard him say it out loud, he was still extremely displeased.

“Then which inner core do you want? I’ll go and bring it back for you now.”Qin Yu suppressed his anger and said.

Ye Nan casually picked up the inner core and said with a smile, “I have no way to tell you which inner core it is. Anyway, it’s not this one.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer in his heart. This ye Nan was really cunning.

“In that case, you will go with me and help me identify it,”said Qin Yu.

Hearing that, ye Nan waved his hand and said, “That won’t do. I still have something important to do. How can I have time to go to the demon cave with you?”

Qin Yu glanced at the table in front of him and said with a frown, “Aren’t you drinking tea? What’s the matter? Moreover, this place is not far from the demon cave. I Won’t waste your time.”

“Who told you that I’m drinking tea? I’m trying to comprehend the Dao!”Ye Nan snorted.

“Anyway, I won’t agree to it unless you bring back the inner core that I want.”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. Although he was extremely displeased, he had to agree to it since he did have something to ask of him.

Therefore, Qin Yu nodded and said, “Okay, then I’ll make another trip. You wait here.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and walked out of the Ye family’s grotto-heaven.

Looking at Qin Yu’s back, Ye Nan couldn’t help but sneer.

“To fall for the same trick twice, you’re really a fool,”ye Nan said sarcastically.

Then, he took out the inner core and played with it happily.

“It’s really a good thing, an unexpected gain.”An excited smile appeared on Ye Nan’s face.

He played with this inner core and couldn’t put it down.

That evening.

Qin Yu rushed back to the Ye family again. At the same time, another inner core appeared in his hand.

“Take a look and see if it’s this one.”Qin Yu handed the inner core to Ye Nan.

Ye Nan took the inner core and was immediately overjoyed, but his face was calm.

He frowned slightly and sighed, “Unfortunately, this one isn’t it either.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but clench his fists and said, “Are you trying to play me?”

Hearing this, Ye Nan immediately slammed the table and stood up. He said angrily, “Kid, what did you say? When did I play you?”

Qin Yu said with a cold face, “I asked you which demonic beast it was and what kind of inner core it was. You Didn’t say a word and didn’t know anything. and the inner core that I brought back was all taken by you. If this isn’t playing me, then what is?”

Ye Nan said with a cold face, “Hehe, Kid, you found the wrong demonic beast, and you still want to Blame It on me? Since you said that, then I’ll tell you that from now on, the price has increased!”

“What do you mean?”Qin Yu asked in a cold voice.

Ye nan sneered, “If you want me to go to the northern border with you, I can. I want five inner core! Including the two that you gave me just now, you have to give me three more!”

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely cold, and an obvious killing intent appeared on his body.

However, Ye Nan was not afraid at all. He lay on the rocking chair and said indifferently, “What? Do you still want to fight with me?”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and forcefully suppressed his anger.

If he killed ye Nan now, he might really not be able to gather enough people.

“Alright, I’ll agree to it,”Qin Yu said coldly.

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and walked out of the Ye family grotto-heaven again.

After Qin Yu left, Ye Nan’s butler walked out from the side.

“Master Ye, if this Qin Yu really brought back three inner core, what would you do?”The Butler asked in confusion.

Ye nan sneered, “Repeating the same trick, I will tell him that I still don’t have the inner core I want. In short, I have ten thousand ways to brush him off. Sooner or later, I will make him retreat.”

Then, ye Nan handed the inner core to the butler and asked him to keep it all.

Qin Yu left this time and didn’t come back for three whole days.

This made ye Nan almost forget about Qin Yu. The butler beside him said with some curiosity, “This Qin Yu can come back one day at most every time. Why did he go there for three days this time?”

Only then did ye Nan think of Qin Yu. He said indifferently, “Needless to say, he must have died in the demonic cave. The strength of the Demonic Beast in the demonic cave is uneven. I asked him to kill three demonic beasts. The probability of him dying there is very high.”

The Butler suddenly came to a realization. He immediately gave ye Nan a thumbs up and said, “Patriarch ye is really mysterious and clever!”

Ye Nan was very pleased. This time, not only did he get the treasures from Qin Yu for free, but he also got a few inner core. How could he not be happy in his heart.

However, just as ye Nan was excited, a young man walked in from outside.

He was covered in blood and looked extremely miserable.

The coldness that he was emitting made people shudder.

This person was none other than Qin Yu!

Ye Nan couldn’t help but be a little surprised when he saw Qin Yu returning. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

He sized up Qin Yu from head to toe, then, he said hypocritically, “Aiya, what do you think happened? Are you injured? Aiya, if you really can’t do it, then come back. It’s not an easy thing to do. Why do you have to get yourself injured?”

Qin Yu glanced at the blood on his body and then said, “Oh, this is not my blood.”

With that, Qin Yu’s body shook. The terrifying true energy immediately shook off the blood on his body, revealing his undamaged body.

This could not help but make ye Nan frown slightly. He said in a deep voice, “You really brought back the inner core?”

“Yes,”Qin Yu answered.

Ye Nan could not help but sneer.

“It seems that I can only repeat the same trick,”ye Nan thought to himself.

“In order to prevent finding the wrong demonic beast, I casually killed all the remaining demonic beasts. I also brought back all the inner core,”Qin Yu said.

With that, he flipped his palm, and all five inner core fell into his hand.

Seeing the inner core in Qin Yu’s hand flashing with different colors, ye Nan could not help but turn pale with fright.

“You... you killed all the Demonic Beasts in the demonic cave? !”Ye Nan could not help but swallow his saliva.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “That’s right, senior ye. This time, you should follow me to the northern border, right?”

Ye Nan frowned. He took the inner core from Qin Yu’s hand, and then his eyes rolled around, he said with a smile, “Qin Yu, this inner core is indeed not bad, but I seem to have remembered wrongly. The inner core I want does not come from this demonic cave, but from a silver leopard in the depths of the green rock forest! So I’ll have to trouble you to make another trip.”
