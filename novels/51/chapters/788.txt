The next day.

Qin Yu was still lying on the bed with his eyes closed to rest when there was a knock on the door.

When the door opened, Xue Yuzhi was standing at the door.

“Auntie Xue.” Qin Yu hurriedly welcomed her in.

Xue Yuzhi nodded slightly. She brought breakfast and sat opposite Qin Yu.

“Have breakfast first,” Xue Yuzhi said.

Qin Yu didn’t stand on ceremony and immediately opened the lunchbox.

“I’m here today to tell you a piece of good news,” Xue Yuzhi said with a smile.

Qin Yu’s eyes lit up and he quickly said, “Auntie Xue, please speak.”

Xue Yuzhi smiled and said, “After discussion, we have decided to inject the power of a Martial Saint into your body.”

“Thank you, Auntie Xue!” Qin Yu was instantly overjoyed and hurriedly stood up to thank her.

However, Xue Yuzhi smiled and said, “If you want to thank someone, then thank your Pavilion Master. It was because she was willing to vouch for you that we believed you.”

Upon hearing this, Qin Yu felt even more grateful towards the Pavilion Master.

“We did agree to inject the power of the Martial Saint into your body. However, there is still one problem at the moment,” Xue Yuzhi said.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Go ahead.”

“You said that you will owe the Xue family a favor and guarantee that the Xue family will live forever, right?” Xue Yuzhi said.

“That’s right.” Qin Yu nodded.

“But have you ever thought that the power of the Martial Saint can be used at any time to deal with an emergency, but you can’t?” Xue Yuzhi said in a deep voice.

“You are far away in Pyro and the journey would be long. If the Xue family really faces a catastrophe, it will be too late for you to make a move even if you want to.” Xue Yuzhi said in a low voice.

“And the Sheng country is a land of chaos and there are many powers. No one can guarantee that the next Purple Flame Sect won’t appear.”

Hearing Xue Yuzhi’s words, Qin Yu immediately fell silent.

Xue Yuzhi was right. Distant waters couldn’t save a near fire. If anything were to happen to the Xue family, it would be impossible for Qin Yu to rush over immediately.

Qin Yu didn’t speak for a long while. A moment later, he suddenly turned to look at Xue Yuzhi.

“Auntie Xue, I will handle this matter properly. Please rest assured.” Qin Yu said with a serious face.

Xue Yuzhi said with some doubt, “Can you tell me how to handle it?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “For now, keep it a secret. But I will promise you that I will guarantee the safety of the Xue family.”

Xue Yuzhi was silent for a moment. In the end, she chose to trust Qin Yu.

“Auntie Xue, when will the infusion ceremony of the Martial Saint’s power begin?” Qin Yu asked.

Xue Yuzhi said, “I will come and look for you at eight o’clock tonight.”

“Okay.” Qin Yu held back the excitement in his heart and nodded.

After Xue Yuzhi left, Qin Yu couldn’t calm down for the entire day.

Although the Martial Saint’s power didn’t make him a true Martial Saint, as long as anything was tainted with the phrase Martial Saint, it would be a world of difference from the Martial Marquis.

Even the power of a Martial Saint could unleash such a terrifying power on Blackie’s body, let alone in Qin Yu’s body?

Time flew by and in the blink of an eye, it was already evening.

Xue Yuzhi arrived in front of Qin Yu’s room at around seven o’clock in the evening.

Qin Yu had already made preparations. The moment he saw Xue Yuzhi, he immediately stood up.

“Come with me,” Xue Yuzhi said with a smile.

Qin Yu hurriedly nodded. He followed behind Xue Yuzhi and walked toward a secret room in the Xue family manor.

The Xue family manor was located in many properties. One of the houses that looked like a bunker was extremely inconspicuous.

The two of them stopped in front of the door.

Xue Yuzhi looked up at the door and said, “This is it.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and suppressed the excitement in his heart.

Then, Xue Yuzhi raised her palm and placed it on the door.

In an instant, the door flashed with a dazzling light. Countless strange runes flashed in front of Qin Yu.

“Boom!”

With a loud sound, the door of the blockhouse slowly opened!

The moment the door opened, a wave of internal qi rushed in.

Xue Yuzhi was the first to step in. She looked at Qin Yu and said, “Come in.”

Qin Yu didn’t waste any time and quickly followed her in.

Rays of light lit up the room. As far as the eye could see, the huge blockhouse was quite empty.

And in the middle of it, there was a huge round plate.

The round plate was engraved with densely packed talismans. In the center of this round plate, there was a small rusty lock.

Qin Yu had never seen the power of a Martial Saint, so he didn’t know anything about the infusion of the power of a Martial Saint.

He looked at the scene before him and couldn’t help but say with some surprise, “Is this the power of a Martial Saint?”

Xue Yuzhi didn’t pay attention to Qin Yu. She walked to the center of the round plate and put her hands together. She murmured in a low voice, as if she was casting some kind of spell.

Then, Xue Yuzhi bit her finger and dripped a drop of blood at the center of the disk.

“Rumble...”

A moment later, the disk suddenly started to spin slowly with a loud rumble.

Rays of bright light burst out from the disk!

What followed closely was a strong sense of oppression!

Qin Yu’s expression was solemn. He couldn’t help but take two steps back.

A human figure appeared above the light.

The human figure was extremely handsome and tall. He seemed like he was looking down on the world.

His deep eyes emitted a dazzling light.

Xue Yuzhi knelt on the ground and said in a low voice, “Forefather, please infuse the power of a Martial Saint to protect the Xue family from this calamity.”

That figure swept a cold glance at Xue Yuzhi. His eyes covered Xue Yuzhi’s body and he sighed. “Has the Xue family finally reached this situation?”

Xue Yuzhi remained silent as she knelt on the ground and pressed her palms together.

“Come, I will use my final strength to protect the Xue family,” the ancestor said coldly.

Hearing this, Xue Yuzhi hurriedly looked at Qin Yu. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Qin Yu didn’t dare to waste any more time. He immediately took large strides forward and stood in front of the ancestor.

He clasped his hands together and bowed slightly. There was a respectful expression on his face.

The figure slowly raised his palm. In an instant, light shone in all directions. Waves of powerful internal qi rushed towards Qin Yu’s head!

In an instant, Qin Yu only felt a trace of warmth flowing through his body. This warmth flowed from the top of his head to all parts of his body.

Waves of terrifying power brewed within Qin Yu’s body.

With the infusion of the Martial Saint’s power, the old ancestor’s figure also began to dim.

Qin Yu’s dantian was filled with streams of power that didn’t belong to him.

This power was beyond his imagination. It was a power that Qin Yu had never felt before!

His entire body seemed to have undergone a transformation at this moment. Even his physical body had become more indestructible!

The process lasted for a full three hours before it gradually came to an end. At this time, that figure had already become somewhat blurry.

“Junior, remember, you must never let the Xue family perish!” That voice left behind its final message before it drifted into the air and completely disappeared.
