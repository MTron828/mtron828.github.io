1975 Things Have Been Stolen

A total of eight Saint Weapons were hanging in all directions!

Qin Yu couldn’t help but gasp. How extravagant was that?

Although not all the eight Saint Weapons were completely revived, any one of them was incredibly noble.

“As expected of Sky City. No other place can compare to this kind of extravagance.” Qin Yu was shocked and speechless.

!!

Many top-notch sects would have been considered lucky enough to have owned just a Saint Weapon. It was vastly different from Sky City. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“If fighting is not allowed in Sky City, why would they use the eight Saint Weapons?” Qin Yu was a little confused.

Would people fight during the auction in Sky City? Or was this auction purely for showing off their strength?

Qin Yu stopped thinking about it since it had nothing to do with him.

Moreover, it was simply impossible to kill and snatch here.

Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly and quietly released his divine sense.

Many experts were in the auction house and many that Qin Yu could not see through.

“As expected of the number one auction in Zhongzhou. It really lives up to its reputation,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

The only thing that shocked Qin Yu was that there were no restrictions on qualifications, which puzzled people.

Time flew by, and the auction’s door slowly closed.

According to the announcement outside, the auction would begin in about half an hour.

Meanwhile, the Saint Weapons hanging in the air slowly grew dim.

Seeing this, Qin Yu also understood the purpose of the auction.

They used these eight Saint Weapons to announce the auction’s strength to the outside world and warn those who harbored ill intentions.

Qin Yu ignored it. He didn’t know what rare items would appear in today’s auction. However, with so many people here, he thought there must be some extraordinary treasures.

As time passed, the entire auction became incredibly quiet. Not even a person spoke.

Soon, half an hour had passed. However, no one appeared on the stage, and the auction was incredibly quiet.

“How the auction in Sky City be late?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but be secretly shocked.

He looked at the people in the surroundings and found them not expressing much. He thus ignored it.

Time flew by, and another half an hour passed n the blink of an eye. However, no one showed up for the auction.

At this moment, everyone in the room started to become restless, and some noise could be heard.

After a while, the crowd started to discuss animatedly.

“What’s going on? Why is the auction delayed today?”

“It doesn’t make sense. This has never happened before.”

“Could it be that something untoward has happened?”

Their remarks made Qin Yu feel a little uneasy.

“Could it be that the nine great aristocratic families are going to attack me?” Qin Yu muttered in his heart.

In that case, it would be troublesome.

“Buzz!”

At this moment, the Saint Weapons hanging in the corners began to glow and light up again!

The glaring light, accompanied by traces of Holy Power, made everyone feel uneasy.

Of course, the one who feared the most was Qin Yu.

He subconsciously looked around and adjusted the internal qi in his body, preparing to escape.

“Buzz!”

Another beam of light came. Following that, the door opened. Two elders appeared and blocked the door.

The two had tremendous powerful strength and had indeed entered the Semi-Saint realm.

They had dignified appearances, and their expressions were grave as if something serious had happened.

At the same time, someone finally appeared on the stage.

A middle-aged man in a black robe walked up the stage in a panic. His forehead was sweating profusely in a cold sweat as if he was afraid of something.

“Everyone, we’re really sorry. There was an accident in this auction…” the middle-aged man on the stage said in a trembling voice.

“I’ll have to trouble everyone to cooperate. For the time being, no one is allowed to leave this place.”

As soon as he said that, the scene was immediately in an uproar.

No one was allowed to leave! Wasn’t it imprisoning everyone in disguise?

“What do you mean by this? What do you mean by saying ‘no one can leave’? Are you going to restrict our freedom?” A middle-aged man with an ice-cold expression berated.

“Although your auction house is very powerful, we will not allow you to do as you please. Are you going to restrict our freedom? Do you really think we’re afraid?

“If you don’t give us a reasonable explanation, don’t blame us for being impolite!”

The middle-aged man on the stage became even more panicked. He kept wiping the sweat from his forehead and smiled bitterly as if he didn’t know how to explain.

At this moment, a young man walked out.

This young man’s expression was cold and his bearing was extraordinary.

His appearance also made everyone calm down a lot.

“The auction items have been snatched,” the young man said coldly.

As soon as he said this, the scene was in an uproar again!

The auction items had been snatched! This was in Sky City! And behind them were the nine great aristocratic families!

Who would dare to mess with the nine great aristocratic families? Was he crazy?

“How could it be? Who dared to snatch the auction items?”

“What’s going on?”

The young man said coldly, “The auction items disappeared not long ago. Thus you can’t leave for the time being. We have to investigate the matter first. Thank you for your cooperation.”

Qin Yu frowned.

Someone snatched the items! Why was there no movement at all? Furthermore, the speed of it was a little too fast, right?

In just a few hours, the auction items were gone.

Eight Saint Weapons were hanging in this venue. How powerful were the ones who escorted the treasures? How could it have disappeared without a trace?

“Who snatched them? Why were there no sounds of battle in Sky City?” Qin Yu raised his doubts.

What Qin Yu said certainly voiced everyone’s doubts. Instantly, everyone looked at Qin Yu.

The young man glanced at Qin Yu coldly, and then said in a cold voice, “Rumor has it that he’s from the demon race.”

“That demon race member? The young man who killed several heirs not long ago?”

“He’s actually in Sky City? And he even snatched things away?”

“Not only is he tremendously powerful, but he can also take things away quietly without anyone noticing. This… How terrifying is this?”

The young man continued, “Two people took away the items. One was the young man from the demon race, and the other’s identity is unknown. We suspect it has something to do with the people here. Thus we would appreciate your cooperation. After we investigate the matter, we will let you leave, and our auction house will definitely compensate you.”

Qin Yu had a bad feeling, but he couldn’t tell what it was.
