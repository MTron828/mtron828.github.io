Chapter 1275: Chapter 1275, the desolate God’s eye displayed its might 

“They might have received some news.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“What’s Wrong?”Guan Zhuang noticed Qin Yu’s abnormality. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Qin Yu shook his head and did not explain.

The surrounding people also raised their heads and looked at the Fey beast that was whizzing past.

“It’s the people from the Tianyun sect. Why are they here?”The surrounding people discussed.

“Looking at this direction, it seems like they’re going to the Imperial Palace.”

“They came to Gu City to look for the city Lord.”

Hearing the discussions in the surroundings, Qin Yu felt more and more uneasy.

He didn’t have a deep understanding of the heavenly cloud sect. It could even be said that no one understood the true strength of the Heavenly Cloud sect. They only knew that they had once swept across more than half of the southern province, along with a few other top sects, as well as a few other great sects in the Rayleigh Province.

“Let’s go. Take Me to find the life force,”said Qin Yu.

Guan Zhuangen said, then he led the way and led Qin Yu to a certain place.

It had to be said that the prosperity of Gu City was indeed dazzling.

Even when walking on the street, one could see all kinds of lights and colorful flashes from time to time. There were even warriors fighting again.

Such a scene was simply impossible to see on Earth.

“By the way, why don’t You Use Your Spiritual Power?”On the way, Guan Zhuang asked casually.

Qin Yu did not hide it. He sighed and said, “Because my spiritual power has disappeared. Now, I continue to recover my life force.”

When Guan Zhuang heard this, David was immediately shocked.

He stared at Qin Yu and said, “You mean... you don’t have spiritual power now, and you have such abilities?”

“You can say that.”Qin Yu nodded slightly.

This made Guan Zhuang’s eyes widen.

Previously, Guan Zhuang had always thought that Qin Yu didn’t want to use spiritual power, but his body still relied on spiritual power to support it.

But he didn’t expect that Qin Yu didn’t have spiritual power at all.

“Qin Yu, according to what you said, if you recover your spiritual power, I’m afraid that your strength... is unimaginable!”Guan Zhuang said in surprise.

“At that time, I think it’s not a problem to win a city in the South Province or become an elder of a big sect.”

Qin Yu smiled and didn’t say anything. He didn’t continue this topic.

He followed behind Guan Zhuang and came to a shop.

The decoration of this shop was extremely luxurious. It had a huge area and looked like a museum on Earth.

After stepping into the shop, it was even more lively.

Qin Yu glanced at the huge shop and asked, “What is this place?”

Guan Zhuang smiled and said, “I know the owner of this shop. I can ask him to help you look for it.”

After that, Guan Zhuang walked over and said a few words to the shop assistant. After a few minutes, a middle-aged man in a long robe walked out.

“Guan Zhuang, why are you here?”When he saw Guan Zhuang, the middle-aged man cupped his hands.

Guan Zhuang smiled and said, “I would like to introduce you to a friend. This is our hunter, Qin Yu. This is the boss of Luo Hai Tower, Luo Hai.”

“Greetings, boss Luo.”Qin Yu bowed slightly as a form of greeting.

Luo Hai also bowed back and said, “Guan Zhuang, why are you looking for me?”

Guan Zhuang did not hide anything and said immediately, “This brother of mine needs something. I’m afraid he needs your help.”

“Haha, Just Tell Me What It is. I Won’t say that I have everything here, but I’m one of the best in the entire Gu City,”Luo Hai said with a faint smile.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Boss Luo, I need the life energy, and I need it urgently.”

“Life Energy?”Luo Hai was slightly surprised.

He frowned and said, “This thing is not easy to find...”

“If it were easy to find, I wouldn’t bother you,”Guan Zhuang said with a smile.

Luo Hai was silent for a moment and said, “Unfortunately, I don’t have the life energy here. But don’t worry, I will keep an eye out for you. As soon as there is any news, I will tell you immediately!”

“Thank you, boss Luo.”Qin Yu bowed and said.

It could be seen that the life energy was more lacking than expected.

“You guys go ahead. I still have something to do over there, so I won’t accompany you guys.”Luo Hai greeted Guan Zhuang and then walked to the side.

Qin Yu followed behind Guan Zhuang and asked as they walked, “Big Brother Guan, can we trust this Luo Hai?”

Guan Zhuang waved his hand and said, “What’s there to trust? It’s just driven by interests. This Luo Hai Tower has a close relationship with our hunter organization. Naturally, they will give us some face.”

Qin Yu nodded. That was true. After all, many treasures were obtained from Demon Beasts.

Soon, the two of them left the Luo Hai Tower.

Qin Yu followed behind Guan Zhuang and came to another special place: The Stone gambling shop.

This stone gambling shop was almost the most lively place in the entire bustling district.

Human Nature was greedy, even for cultivators.

Therefore, as long as it was related to gambling, there would often be no lack of business.

“It’s best not to touch this place,”Guan Zhuang reminded softly.

“I have been in Gu City for many years, so I know the routine here. 99% of these raw stones are waste that was selected by someone. Even 10,000 pieces might not be enough to produce a treasure.”

Qin Yu touched his chin, but he was actually somewhat interested.

The reason was none other than Qin Yu’s control of the desolate God’s eye.

The desolate God’s eye could see through the void, so the raw stones naturally had nowhere to hide.

“I’m just having a little fun,”Qin Yu said with a smile.

Guan Zhuang pulled Qin Yu back and said helplessly, “Kid, you really don’t listen to advice at all.”

Qin Yu did not explain. There were many people around the gambling den. Most of them were dressed luxuriously and had extraordinary looks. The spirit coins in their hands were thrown out in large handfuls.

“The aura of life is extremely expensive, and I am very short of money. This might be a way to earn money,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

The raw stones here were very expensive. Any one of them would cost tens of thousands of spirit coins.

And there were at least tens of thousands of raw stones in this stone gambling shop!

Qin Yu did not waste any time. His glabella shimmered as the desolate God’s eye appeared in his mind.

Wherever the eye passed, the interior of the raw stone would be exposed.

“It’s really like what Guan Zhuang said.”Qin Yu could not help but frown.

Most of the raw stones here were empty, and there were very few treasures.

But soon, Qin Yu found an unusual raw stone.

This raw stone looked quite ordinary, and it was no different from other raw stones.

On the side of the raw stone, the price was written: 30,000 spirit coins.

Without thinking, Qin Yu pointed at the raw stone and said, “Please help me cut this piece open.”

“Okay!”

The Master of the stone gambling shop immediately took this raw stone and immediately cut it open in front of everyone’s eyes.
