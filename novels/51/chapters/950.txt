Chapter 951: Chapter 951 forced him to reveal himself 

“Damn it!”This instantly made Gu Xinghe even angrier!

He shattered the bathtub, and blood instantly splattered everywhere!

“It actually didn’t work...”Gu Xinghe’s face was full of anger.

Yan Jinyao’s success made Gu Xinghe feel extremely pressured.

More importantly, Yan Jinyao also wanted to challenge the martial saint!

This meant that the benefits of the blood to him were beyond imagination!

“It seems like I need to consult the higher-ups.”Gu Xinghe took a deep breath and suppressed the anger in his heart.

...

On the other side, Qin Yu’s body was getting weaker and weaker.

The massive loss of blood made it difficult for Qin Yu’s internal Qi to recover.

The pain all over his body was tormenting Qin Yu’s spiritual sense.

“Divine sense?”

At this moment, Qin Yu seemed to have thought of something!

He could extract a part of his divine sense. Although it couldn’t be too far away from his main body, it should be able to alleviate some of the pain, right?

Moreover, Qin Yu still hadn’t figured out the secret of the spatial artifact.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu immediately closed his eyes and forced out a strand of divine sense from his glabella.

A strand of golden light fell into the spatial divine weapon.

In front of Qin Yu, it instantly turned black.

“Damn it! It’s useless!”

Unfortunately, even though Qin Yu’s spiritual sense had been pulled out, it was still unable to resist this pain.

Perhaps this was also because the spiritual sense could not leave the main body too far away.

“In the end, I’m not a martial saint. I Can’t separate my primordial spirit...”Qin Yu sighed slightly in the bottom of his heart.

He did not dare to waste any more time. He endured the pain and headed towards the abyss.

He arrived near the abyss.

As usual, Qin Yu stuck his head out and shouted towards the abyss below.

“Senior?”Qin Yu called out tentatively.

However, there was no response from the Abyss.

“Senior, I know you can hear me. I also know that you’re hiding below,”Qin Yu continued to say.

“I have no ill intentions. I am here to save you.”

“Senior? If you can hear me, please respond.”

“...”

No matter how hard Qin Yu tried to speak, there was still no movement below.

That Ray of light just lay there, not moving at all.

“Senior, do you want Spirit Stones? I have many more here, I can give them to you,”Qin Yu said seductively.

“Not only spirit stones, but also a lot of great tonic items. I can give you any herbs or treasures!”

“Senior, the spirit stones from before are just sprinkling water on me. As long as you respond to me, I can give you more!”

After shouting, Qin Yu almost lost his voice. However, there was still no movement from below. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Could it be that Luo Jingyu lied to me? This is not spiritual sense at all?”Qin Yu thought to himself.

‘that’s not right!’

But very quickly, Qin Yu rejected this idea.

Luo Jingyu might be lying, but the handlebar mustache could not lie to him.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and looked at that glimmer of light.

“Senior, don’t tell me you want to lie to me down there and swallow my spiritual sense? If that’s the case, no one will be able to save you,”Qin Yu muttered.

But there was still no movement below.

This immediately caused Qin Yu to lose his patience.

In addition to the waves of pain brought by his physical body, Qin Yu’s anger was also rising.

“What Bullsh * t senior, are you a mute?”Qin Yu cursed at the Abyss.

“I think you’re a son of a B * Tch, and you call yourself a Senior!”

“I reckon that when you were alive, you were also trash, right? Otherwise, how could you be suppressed to such a place?”

“What a piece of trash. You Can’t even protect your own body. You can only stay in this abyss for the rest of your life. You’re nothing.”

After a series of curses, Qin Yu was surprised to discover that the ray of light was actually shaking slightly!

“Looks like it’s effective!”Qin Yu was instantly overjoyed!

Hence, he immediately increased his firepower.

“Trash, good-for-nothing!”

“F * CK You, Immortal Board!”

“I’ll Throw Your Ancestral Grave Tomorrow!”

“I’ll watch your wife take a bath the day after tomorrow!”

“I’ll poop for you later!”

“I’ll poop for you the day after tomorrow...”

“Little B * stard, don’t go too far!”

At this moment, an explosive shout suddenly came from below!

That voice was like rolling thunder, causing one’s ears to hurt!

Qin Yu was so scared that he took two steps back, sweat beading on his forehead.

“Phew... looks like it’s really useful. It really is a forced drink,”Qin Yu muttered.

He climbed to the edge of the Abyss again and said with an embarrassed smile, “Senior, there’s nothing I can do. If I didn’t scold you, you wouldn’t have said anything...”

However, the area below fell into silence again.

“Senior?”Qin Yu called out tentatively.

“F * ck, you F * cking refuse a toast only to be forced to drink a forfeit. Are You F * cking cheap?”

“I’m calling you senior, but you don’t care. Are you happy just because I’m scolding you? No wonder I’m trapped in this abyss, I...”

“Shut up!”That voice came again.

Qin Yu could also see that this guy was a soft-hearted person, so he no longer treated him politely.

“Old Man, let me ask you, who f * cking told you to eat my spirit stones?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse.

“You F * cking didn’t say anything. Are you trying to trick me to go down and devour my spiritual sense?”

“Now That You’ve failed, you must be angry out of humiliation, right? Hehe, I won’t go down. I’ll anger you to death!”

In the abyss, that bright voice said with a somewhat gloomy and cold tone, “I let you see through it. That’s right... I just wanted to devour your spiritual sense. I didn’t expect that you, this little B * stard, wouldn’t fall for it... !”

“You F * CKING Old Bastard!”Qin Yu glared at him and cursed.

“Little Bastard, you’d better be polite when you talk to me!”The light said in a gloomy tone.

“Polite to you? What are you? You Can’t even get out of the fucking abyss, and you’re still pretending to be me?”

“You’re courting death!”

“You dare to Scold Your Father?”

“I’ll Cripple You!”

“I’ll pee down there later!”

“You...”

The two sides continued to curse each other.

A moment later, Qin Yu sat down on the ground. He panted and said, “I’m not going to talk nonsense with you anymore. Let’s make a deal. What do you think?”

“Deal? Look at your spiritual sense. You’re just a Marquis of Wu. You want to make a deal with me?”Someone Below said sarcastically.

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said with a smile, “Then what realm are you in?”

“What Realm am I in? It’s not something you can understand,”the other party said coldly.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “What realm can you be in? If your realm was high, would you be locked up here?”

The other party ignored Qin Yu, and the scene fell into silence again.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and then said sarcastically, “You’re not just a martial marquis, are you?”

The other party still ignored him.

Qin Yu stood up and muttered, “A lousy martial marquis, F * CKING wasting my time. I thought he was so powerful that he couldn’t even compare to me...”

Hearing this, the other party couldn’t help but say, “Martial marquis? A martial saint is not even worth mentioning in my eyes!”
