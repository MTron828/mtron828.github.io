Chapter 1439: Chapter 1,439, Dragon Tiger Pill 1

Qin Yu nodded. Zhuo Jing was the leader of this exchange guild, so Qin Yu listened to him.

The entire exchange guild was open. As long as you had something, you could come here and exchange with others.

Some people chose to set up stalls and display their treasures publicly. Others were like Qin Yu, strolling around and selling the treasures they wanted.

In the Exchange Guild, Qin Yu saw a dazzling array of treasures. Many of them shocked him greatly.

There were medicinal herbs for refining, materials for refining weapons, top-notch cultivation techniques, and even alchemy cultivation techniques.

Many of the treasures tempted Qin Yu, but unfortunately, he didn’t have any treasures that could be exchanged. He had to rely on Zhuo Jing for everything. Therefore, Qin Yu tried his best to act as if he wasn’t interested in anything.

Zhuo Jing led Qin Yu through a long dark path, heading deeper into the forest.

He seemed to have a purpose, so he didn’t take a second look at the stalls on both sides of the road.

Qin Yu, on the other hand, was completely different. He looked around as if Granny Liu had entered a grand viewing garden.

Just as the two of them arrived at the Exchange Guild, the Heavenly Cloud sect quickly reported the news to the Great Elder.

The first elder, who had received the news, immediately moved out and headed straight for the Exchange Guild!

“This time, we must kill Qin Yu. We must not give him a chance to live!”The first Elder’s face was as dark as water. He extended his hand and actually took out a bronze-colored divine lamp from the void.

This divine lamp had a depleted wick on it, and there was a strange smell around the divine lamp.

This divine lamp was called the demon subduing divine lamp, and it was one of the most precious treasures of the Heavenly Cloud sect. It was said that this item was comparable to a virtual entity, and its power was endless.

And the Heavenly Cloud sect had not used such a secret treasure for a long time. Now that they had taken out the demon subduing divine lamp, it was obvious that they were serious.

This represented the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s determination to kill Qin Yu in one strike. They could not give Qin Yu any leeway!

The first elder brought the divine lamp and several guardians to the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s mountain top altar.

This was a seemingly desolate altar. On the altar, there was an array platform that had not been activated for a long time!

This array platform was the legendary teleportation array platform!

As a top sect in the South Province, the heavenly cloud sect naturally had a teleportation array!

However, they would not activate this array platform unless it was important.

“Qin Yu, let’s see where you can run to this time!”The first elder’s face was gloomy. He clasped his hands together and muttered. Several teleportation divine stones shot out from his spatial divine artifact!

The first elder personally guided the array formation. He knew the coordinates of the Exchange Guild. With the teleportation array platform, he could quickly reach the exchange guild.

Streaks of mysterious light landed on the array platform. In front of them, it was as if a door to the void had opened.

The first elder brought many protectors and stepped into the array, heading straight for the Displacement Guild!

...

Displacement Guild.

Zhuo Jing brought Qin Yu to a certain stall.

There were many people surrounding this stall.

Their strength wasn’t weak. They were all at the Almighty Realm, and each of their auras were extremely powerful.

As for the stall’s owner, his eyes were slightly closed as he erected a sign in front of the stall. A few words were written on the sign: do not speak unless you have a treasure.

Such a gesture showed his confidence.

Zhuo Jing pushed aside the crowd and brought Qin Yu to the front of the stall.

He went straight to the point and said, “Stall owner, we are here to look for the aura of life.”

When they heard the words ‘aura of life’, everyone’s eyes fell on Zhuo Jing and Qin Yu.

“En? Isn’t this the Qin Yu that is wanted by the Heavenly Cloud Sect?”Someone at the side recognized Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu? Why? Did you come to the Exchange Guild to hide?”Someone teased. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Qin Yu smiled bitterly. He had never thought that his name would spread for such a reason.

After the stall owner Heard Qin Yu’s name, he slowly opened his eyes.

“You are that Qin Yu?”The stall owner did not look at him sideways.

Qin Yu bowed slightly as a form of greeting.

“I heard that you’re in urgent need of Life Qi, right?”The stall owner asked.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “That’s right. Life Qi is indeed very important to me.”

“Stall owner, there’s no need to beat around the bush. Just State your conditions directly,”Zhuo Jing said.

He flipped his palm and took out a few pills.

“This pill is the Dragon Tiger Pill that I’ve treasured for many years. It was left behind by my father. During the Great War back then, hundreds of pills were consumed. Now, there are only three left,”Zhuo Jing said.

“How about using these three pills to exchange for your life force?”

Hearing the words ‘Dragon-tiger pill’, the surrounding people became interested.

“Dragon-tiger Pill? Is it the pill that is said to be able to increase one’s strength for a short period of time after taking it?”Someone beside him exclaimed.

“Not only can this pill increase one’s strength, it can also restore one’s spiritual energy in an extremely short period of time. It is indeed a rare pill and has a crucial role in the Great War.”

“En, the dragon-tiger pill was very common on the battlefield back then, but it disappeared after that.”

The stall owner, however, narrowed his eyes and said, “The dragon-tiger pill is indeed not bad, but it’s a pity that this medicinal pill will damage one’s foundation, right?”
