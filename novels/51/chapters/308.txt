Chapter 309: Heading to Jingdu Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The doctor’s words were like a blow to the head, and Xue Hu’s face instantly paled!

“How... how could this be?!” Xue Hu’s body swayed, and he almost lost his balance.

“Doctor, are... Aren’t you mistaken?” Xue Hu, somewhat incredulous, said.

The doctor said coldly, “You can doubt my medical skills, but you can’t treat me as a fool!”

“Even an inexperienced person can see the fractures!”

Xue Hu’s expression was extremely unsightly, and beads of sweat dripped down his forehead.

How should he explain this to Commander Long?

At this moment, Commander Long rushed over from the other side of the corridor.

“What happened?” Commander Long asked anxiously.

The doctor quickly told Commander Long what had happened.

After listening to him, Commander Long was immediately furious. “You mean that more than ten people were seriously injured? All their bones were broken? How could this happen?”

The doctor said helplessly, “Commander Long, I don’t know either. This is what we found out after they were sent here.”

Commander Long immediately looked at Xue Hu and asked coldly, “What exactly happened?”

Xue Hu’s lips trembled as he said, “I. . . I don’t know either...”

“There must be something wrong with your training plan!” Commander Long gnashed his teeth and said.

“Let me ask you, how did you get that training plan? Also, is it a weakened version or an incomplete version? Tell me the truth!”

Now that things had come to this, Xue Hu didn’t dare to continue hiding it.

He knelt on the ground with a plop and cried, “This training plan is indeed an incomplete version, but I didn’t expect it to lead to such consequences...”

“Commander Long, I know I’m wrong. Please spare me this time, sob sob sob sob...”

Commander Long said angrily, “Spare you this time? More than ten people were seriously injured. Who will take responsibility?”

“Xue Hu, you’d better pray that their lives are not in danger. Otherwise, you’ll go to jail!”

The scolding made Xue Hu’s head buzz.

He sat on the ground in a daze without knowing what to do for a moment.

Human lives were at stake. Even Commander Long had to bear the responsibility for such a big incident.

At this moment, Commander Long suddenly thought of Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu once said that your plan is a defective version. I wonder if he has any solutions,” Commander Long thought to himself.

Xue Hu hurriedly got up from the ground and said anxiously, “Commander Long, does he really have a solution? We... We should go find him now!”

Commander Long said with a resentful look, “I really misjudged you! Follow me!”

Xue Hu hurriedly got up from the ground and followed Commander Long out.

It was already early in the morning, and there were almost no pedestrians on the road.

However, a jeep was speeding away at an extremely fast speed.

At Mr. Wu’s house, Qin Yu was standing in the bedroom and sizing up the Purple Gold Gauze Cloth.

Ever since he bought it, Qin Yu had never tried it on.

The Purple Gold Gauze Cloth was flickering with a faint light in the darkness.

“I should try it on,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He had just reached out to pick up the Purple Gold Gauze Cloth when the sound of a car braking came from outside.

Qin Yu looked out of the window and saw a military green jeep.

“Huh? It’s faster than I thought,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Soon, there was a knock on the door, but Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry. He sat in his room and waited quietly.

A few minutes later, Mr. Wu’s voice came from the door of Qin Yu’s bedroom.

“Qin Yu, are you asleep? Commander Long is looking for you for an urgent matter,” Mr. Wu shouted from outside the door.

Qin Yu knew the seriousness of the matter, so he didn’t act rashly and immediately opened the door.

As soon as the door opened, Xue Hu fell to his knees with a plop.

“Qin Yu, please help me...” Xue Hu said with snot and tears.

Qin Yu raised his palm, and a gentle force lifted him up.

“Let’s go,” said Qin Yu.

Commander Long was stunned and asked in confusion, “Where are we going?”

“To save people,” said Qin Yu.

“Didn’t you come to find me because of this?”

This immediately surprised Commander Long even more!

He looked at Qin Yu in surprise and couldn’t help but think to himself, ‘Qin Yu has already predicted everything?’

“Human lives are at stake, so don’t waste time,” urged Qin Yu.

Commander Long came back to his senses and quickly nodded. “Okay!”

Thus, the group of four sped toward the Chuzhou region.

Half an hour later, Qin Yu followed them to the ward.

Looking at the people lying on the bed, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

“Qin Yu, how is it? Do you have any ideas?” Commander Long asked anxiously.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Commander Long, don’t worry. I can cure them.”

Commander Long immediately heaved a sigh of relief. He quickly shouted, “Doctor, come in quickly and tell Mr. Qin about the patients’ conditions!”

“There’s no need,” Qin Yu interrupted Commander Long.

During the Foundation Establishment Stage, Qin Yu not only unleashed the talent of having a strong physical body, but at the same time, his eyes were also quietly changing.

An imperceptible light flashed in Qin Yu’s eyes.

After sweeping his eyes over, Qin Yu had a general understanding of the situation.

“Broken bones and damaged internal organs? It’s more serious than I imagined,” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

This made Commander Long even more surprised!

How did Qin Yu know everything?

“Officer Xue, I’ll have to trouble you to deliver these two types of pills to the patients’ mouths.” Qin Yu extended his palm, and more than twenty pills fell into his palm.

The pill was only the size of a grain of rice, so it wasn’t difficult to consume.

Xue Hu didn’t dare to neglect the patients, so he hurriedly took the pills and began to deliver them to the patients’ mouths one by one.

“Qin Yu, when did you refine these pills?” Mr. Wu asked in puzzlement.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Didn’t you ask me why I was hiding in the bedroom yesterday?”

Mr. Wu said in surprise, “You... were refining these pills?”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “Yes.”

“Are these pills really useful?” Commander Long interrupted.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Just wait.”

A few minutes later, the unconscious patient sat up from the bed as expected!

One, two, three... In the blink of an eye, almost all the members of the team sat up from the bed!

“How amazing! This is really amazing!” Commander Long couldn’t help but click his tongue in wonder!

“Move around and see if there’s anything wrong with your bodies,” said Qin Yu. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Everyone hurriedly shook their bodies.

“How great!” Commander Long couldn’t help but shout excitedly.

“Qin Yu, it’s all my fault for blaming you!” Commander Long said apologetically.

“From today on, you are the captain of the Longhu team. Come, Let’s talk in the office!” Commander Long pulled Qin Yu enthusiastically and walked into the office.

In the office, Commander Long poured a cup of hot tea for Qin Yu.

His face was brimming with a smile, and his excitement was almost impossible to hide.

“Commander Long, I have a question,” Qin Yu suddenly said.

Commander Long nodded and said, “If you have any questions, just say it!”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Which city will the competition be held in this time?”

“Of course it’s Jingdu,” Commander Long said.

Qin Yu suppressed the excitement inside and continued to ask, “Can I go to Jingdu with you?”
