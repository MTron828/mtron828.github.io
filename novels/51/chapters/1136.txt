Chapter 1137: Chapter 1,137, scrap metal 

Yao Qing reminded him, “Mr. Qin, they are high-tech war machines. I don’t know what materials they are made of, but they are extremely hard.”

“I have already stepped into the half-step martial saint realm, but I am still not their match. You...”

Yao Qing did not continue, but his intention was obvious.

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said, “Then what realm do you think I’m at Now?”

Yao Qing sized up Qin Yu from head to toe and then said with a smile, “Mr. Qin, although you were much stronger than me before, I’ve been training with all my might over the past year.”

“In the era where Martial Saints did not appear, I was almost the strongest!”Yao Qing said with extreme pride.

Upon hearing these words, Qin Yu could not help but laugh.

This hidden dragon country had completely fallen behind the times.

“Alright, stop talking and quickly set off.”Qin Yu waved his hand and said.

Seeing that Qin Yu was so insistent, Yao Qing did not say anything more and immediately drove Qin Yu away from the airport.

Hidden Dragon Country was a place where the rich and poor were extremely unequal.

Almost all the wealth was in the hands of the Ding family.

It was not an exaggeration to say that their family controlled 99% of the resources of hidden dragon country. It was extremely terrifying.

The car soon arrived at the door of the Ding family.

In such a poor hidden dragon country, there was a huge villa and manor.

This manor was not inferior to the Yan family’s manor.

Looking at the dilapidated buildings around, this ding family manor seemed out of place.

Standing at the door, Qin Yu’s face couldn’t help but turn cold.

The actions of the Ding family were extremely disgusting, even more disgusting than the martial arts association of Jingdu.

This made Qin Yu feel a trace of killing intent rise in his heart.

“Lead the way,”Qin Yu said.

Yao Qing grunted in gratitude. He led Qin Yu through the manor in large strides and walked straight into the villa.

As soon as they entered the door, they saw many bodyguards standing in the room. Each of the bodyguards was armed with bullets, and they were quite vigilant.

“Go and call Ding Yuan out. Tell him that Yao Qing is looking for him,”said Yao Qing.

Yao Qing seemed to be quite famous in the hidden dragon country. When the people here heard the name Yao Qing, a trace of panic flashed across their faces.

“Mr. Yao, Please Wait a moment,”said one of the bodyguards.

After saying that, the bodyguard hurriedly walked away.

“How is it? Is My Reputation Alright?”Yao Qing said with great pride.

Qin Yu did not say anything. He sat on the sofa with his eyes slightly closed.

Not long after, a middle aged man came down from upstairs.

After seeing Yao Qing, the middle aged man said with a faint smile: “What a rare guest. What brings Mister Yao Here?”

Yao Qing did not waste any time and went straight to the point: “My Friend is returning to the fire country, lend me your private jet.”

“Lend it to you?”Ding yuan scoffed and said: “Why should I lend it to you?”

Yao Qing said in a deep voice: “Just take it that I, Yao Qing, owe you a favor.”

“A favor? Haha, sure, if you are willing to work for me, I can lend you my jet.”Ding Yuan said lightly.

Yao Qing frowned and said, “Ding Yuan, you and I are not the same kind of people. You...”

“Then let’s not talk about it. Please go back,”Ding Yuan snorted.

Yao Qing opened his mouth and was about to say something when Qin Yu, who was at the side, said coldly, “You have to borrow it even if you don’t want to.”

Ding Yuan, who was about to go upstairs, suddenly stopped.

He said with a gloomy face, “Kid, what did you say?”

“I don’t want to repeat myself,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“I think you’re courting death! You came to my Ding family to behave atrociously. Are you tired of living?”Ding Yuan said angrily.

Qin Yu looked at Ding Yuan coldly and said slowly, “I think a family like your Ding family doesn’t need to exist anymore. Well, let’s disappear from today on.”

“What big words!”Ding Yuan was instantly enraged!

He looked at Yao Qing coldly and said, “Yao Qing, this kid is tired of living, right? I’ll give you face and tell him to get lost immediately. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being Rude!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Before Yao Qing could speak, Qin Yu said indifferently, “Take out your scrap metal. It just so happens that I want to see it too.”

“Scrap metal? !”Ding Yuan was stunned. Then, he squinted his eyes and said, “Kid, what do you mean?”

Qin Yu sneered, “Didn’t you spend a lot of money to buy some war machine from abroad? Take it out.”

“You said that was scrap metal? !”A trace of anger flashed across Ding Yuan’s face.

Beside him, Yao Qing said in a low voice, “Mr. Qin, that is really not scrap metal! There is an organization overseas that has tested it. That War Machine is very powerful and is on par with a martial saint!”

However, Qin Yu did not pay attention to Yao Qing’s words. He narrowed his eyes and said, “If you don’t take it out now, you won’t have a chance.”

Ding Yuan was so angry that he laughed instead. He pointed at Qin Yu and said, “Good, good. You Brat who doesn’t know the immensity of Heaven and earth. Today, I will let you experience what is called high-tech Power!”

After he finished speaking, a figure flew out from behind him with a swoosh!

His entire body was emitting a cold steel color, and his body was loaded with all kinds of weapons!

This was the war machine that Ding Yuan had spent a high price to customize! It was extremely powerful!

Since things had come to this point, Yao Qing knew that there was no way out. He could only stand up slowly.

His body was emitting the internal Qi of a half-step martial saint. A great battle was about to break out at any moment!

Ding yuan sneered, “Yao Qing, you still don’t know how to repent for not killing you last time, right? Fine, since you can’t be used by me, then you can go to hell!”

After he finished speaking, Ding Yuan ordered the war machine, “Kill them!”

The war machine suddenly stretched out its hand, clenched its fist, and smashed it towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu sat there without moving an inch, allowing the iron fist to smash onto his body.

“Clang!”

A sound that sounded like the collision of iron and steel resounded throughout the room!

Qin Yu sat there without moving an inch. Not a single scratch was left on his body!

“Just this little bit of strength, if it’s not scrap metal, then what is it?”Qin Yu said coldly.

As he spoke, Qin Yu’s internal Qi instantly spread out.

The martial saint’s pressure filled the entire ding manor!
