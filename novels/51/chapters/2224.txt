Chapter 2225 The Power of Life and Death

At the edge of the lightning tribulation, several cultivators did not retreat too far and were accidentally pulled in by the lightning tribulation.

With a terrified howl, several cultivators unleashed their treasure with all their might to escape from the range of the lightning tribulation.

However, they only lasted a few seconds in the terrifying lightning beam before turning into dust.

“Quickly retreat!”

The expressions of some cultivators changed drastically. These cultivators caught in the lightning tribulation were not weak.

They were familiar faces in purgatory but unexpectedly could not last even if it was only ten seconds.

“What kind of spiritual treasure of heaven and earth is this that can attract such a terrifying lightning tribulation?” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

A cultivator said in shock.

At this moment, the man with the mustache looked solemn as his hand quickly formed a seal.

In just a moment, dozens of treasures with immensely powerful internal qi disappeared in different directions.

Among them, Qin Yu could sense a few Saint Weapons.

“You really went all out for this.”

Qin Yu was dumbfounded. He always felt the man with the mustache was stingy.

“The Great Dao of heaven and earth treats all living things as straw dogs. Only when it senses danger will this lightning tribulation appear. I want to snatch a wisp of the soul from this lightning tribulation. It’s more useful than 10 Saint Weapons at the peak state!”

The man with the mustache looked tremendously serious.

“Heaven and earth will probably tremble if this demonic ginseng can survive this lightning tribulation.”

Uncle Ling floating in the air was almost at the edge of the lightning tribulation. However, an enormous shield flashed before him, blocking the massive suction force at the edge of the lightning tribulation.

“Those who are not of my race and are demons of the world should be exterminated! Otherwise, they will undoubtedly bring great calamity upon the human race.”

The evil exterminator held a sword and stared at the demonic ginseng.

The ginseng suddenly opened its mouth, and a green light shot out.

The purest life force instantly enveloped every space. Qin Yu felt that in just a few breaths, his cells were full of vitality, and his life force had increased within a short moment.

A green “river” slowly flowed in the sky. It was a river formed by the purest life force!

“What a vigorous life force!”

Some cultivators hesitated for a moment and even found a place to cultivate.

The ginseng pointed in the air at the heavenly tribulation. All the roots on its body turned into wooden dragons rushing toward the heavenly tribulation.

The moment the dragon swam through the river of life, it instantly expanded a thousand times.

A terrifying internal qi similar to a dragon’s might emanated from the wooden dragons’ bodies. Thousands of wooden dragons frantically welcomed the lightning tribulation.

One dragon, ten dragons, and a hundred dragons.

More and more wooden dragons turned into dust.

Even a true dragon would find it hard to withstand thousands of feet of lightning tribulation.

The dragon emitting the dragon might could only delay the speed of the lightning tribulation for an instant.

The moment the last wooden dragon shattered, the fragments of the wooden dragon that filled the sky turned into black energy.

The river of life instantly turned into a black river.

An indescribable internal qi enveloped the black river. The black river that filled the sky was like the Black Dragon Wave.

After spinning in the air, it suddenly struck the terrifying lightning beam.

The sizzling mist emitted from the lightning beam weakened at a speed visible to the naked eye.

The black mist instantly enveloped everyone.

Several cultivators’ appearance suddenly aged, and in an instant, they turned into white bones.

“F*ck, retreat!”

The man with the mustache slapped a spatial corner marker into Qin Yu’s hand, and the two teleported a thousand meters away instantly.

Many cultivators also sensed that something was wrong and rushed out.

Those who were slightly late were in a sorry state. Several cultivators were caught off guard and absorbed the black internal qi. They even fell to the ground directly, fate unknown.

“The power of life and death! This ginseng had comprehended the rules of the power of life and death. No wonder this lightning tribulation was so terrifying.”

The man with the mustache said in horror.

Seeing that Qin Yu was a little puzzled, he continued to explain to Qin Yu.

“At the end of the power of life lies the power of death. The cycle of life and death repeats endlessly. It’s a power that belongs to the rules of the Path of Heaven, not the path of cultivators.”

Qin Yu frowned. What was the Path of Heaven? Cultivators were indeed acting against the heavens, so why did they have to differentiate between the Path of Heaven and the path of humans?

The lightning tribulation suddenly descended.

The power of the lightning tribulation had been reduced by half after the impact of the life and death qi. However, it was still terrifying.

In an instant, dust filled the sky.

The ground sank thousands of meters in the space where the ginseng was located.

All the rocks within thousands of meters turned into powder.

A delicate baby lay curled up, its body covered in green blood.

As if it was severely injured, its body twitched uncontrollably.

“Charge! Even if I get a finger, it’s enough to save me from cultivating for a hundred years!”

After a short moment of silence, the cultivators and demon beasts suddenly went crazy.

The evil exterminator slashed out his sword, and a bright sword light cut dozens of demons before him into halves.

With another slash, a thigh was chopped off. When it landed in his hand, it had turned into a ginseng limb as thick as an arm.

In an instant, the surrounding people went crazy.

Even the evil exterminator was attacked by numerous demonic beasts and cultivators.

Under the temptation of the treasures of heaven and earth, even cultivators who had been cultivating in seclusion for thousands of years could not control their desires, let alone demon beasts.

“Get lost!”

He frowned and struck out again.

Wherever the sword light reached, there were no survivors.

“Evil Exterminator, retreat first. If you attack again, you would probably attract a siege. These people have become reckless and impulsive.”

rolled down.

After piercing through the hearts of several cultivators, more and more people rushed Uncle Ling abruptly pulled the evil exterminator and Ling Yurou into an illusory space and gradually retreated.

After this, Xuan Yuan also obtained a ginseng arm with the cooperation of many demon beasts. At this moment, this space seemed to have turned into a meat-grinding field.

Every cultivator wanted to get some fragments with all their might.

Some lucky ones got some large fragments and fled frantically. However, in an instant, more demon beasts and cultivators were chasing after them.

When Xuan Yuan wanted to attack again, he felt the world darken.

When it lit up again, a thousand feet long sword aurora slashed down.

The thunderclouds that had not retreated were scattered by this sword.

“Retreat!”

Even Xuan Yuan, who had obtained the bloodline of the divine beast, the black tortoise, did not dare to delay at this moment.

He blocked the attack with his giant shield, and the violent sword aura flew away.

Xi Men stood up. He grabbed half of the body and slowly retreated.

And the other half of the body flew toward Qin Yu.

Cosmic form!

At this moment, Qin Yu’s palm expanded hundreds of times, and he suddenly wrapped the small body into his hand.

In an instant, dozens of cultivators around him attacked him like crazy.

Qin Yu circulated his Saintly Body Technique to the extreme and resisted this wave of attacks.

Then he punched out the Fist of Destruction in the air, and numerous black flames rolled down.

After piercing through the hearts of several cultivators, more and more people rushed toward him in an instant.
