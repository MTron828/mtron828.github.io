1989 Meeting Head-on the Semi-Saint

A rogue cultivator had such a shocking internal qi. Even the Semi-Saint felt somewhat uncomfortable.

“It’s a good thing that he is still fledgeless, or else he’ll become a big problem,” the Semi-Saint said coldly.

Gu Xinghe’s expression was even more unsightly. Although he had mentally prepared himself, he still did not expect Qin Yu’s strength to be so terrifying!

Looking at Qin Yu, who was covered in golden light, the Semi-Saint stepped forward and pressed his powerful pressure on Qin Yu!

!!

The two internal qi clashed at this moment. Qin Yu’s strength had been improved with the support of the fifth level of the fighting word formula. He was not afraid even facing the pressure of a Semi-Saint!

Everything in the surroundings shattered, but like an old pine tree, Qin Yu did not move an inch.

“Crack!”

Soon, the ground under his feet could not withstand it anymore and instantly crumbled. Densely packed cracks spread into the distance!

The Semi-Saint’s expression turned cold and he said coldly, “Little b*stard, you have some skills, but that’s all you can do!”

After he finished speaking, he took the lead and stepped forward!

This Semi-Saint didn’t use any technique. Instead, he simplified the complexity and threw a simple punch at Qin Yu!

This punch looked simple. But it actually contained a myriad of dao techniques, and its power was endless!

Qin Yu didn’t dodge. Instead, with a roar, the golden light bloomed. He raised the Ten Thousand Spell Breaking Punch and met the attack head-on!

“Boom!”

During the collision, the earth crumbled, and the dark clouds scattered. A terrifying radiance shot up into the sky!

The terrifying internal qi generated by their collision even forced the surrounding people backward! The onlookers in the distance couldn’t stop vomiting blood!

Qin Yu’s physical body was incredibly strong. However, the gap in their cultivation realms still caused him to step back a few steps, and her fists were numb!

On the contrary, the Semi-Saint looked much more relaxed. He stood still.

Qin Yu’s heart sank, and he frowned slightly. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“As expected of a Semi-Saint. I’m no match for him even if I fight with my physical body…” Qin Yu murmured.

The Semi-Saint was also puzzled.

“So this is the chaotic body. It’s indeed terrifying,” the Semi-Saint said in a low voice.

However, he did not show any mercy. He raised his hand and struck out with his palm, trying to suppress Qin Yu!

Qin Yu certainly didn’t dare to be slow. He clenched his left hand into a fist and speedily made a seal.

A ray of golden light turned into a sharp blade and met the palm of the Semi-Saint. At the same time, Qin Yu’s fist was also fast approaching the Semi-Saint!

The Semi-Saint snorted lightly. With a thought, he spat out a celestial aura and easily dissolved Qin Yu’s fist. Then, he flipped his hand and slapped Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly. He stepped on the line word formula and shot to the distance. Simultaneously, he already had the Ten Thousand Spell Breaking Punch in his hand, and he ruthlessly bombarded the Semi-Saint!

The Semi-Saint put his hands behind his back with ridicule on his face. His body trembled slightly, and thousands of rays of light rushed out of his body. The rays of light condensed into one and directly dispersed Qin Yu’s fist!

The surrounding people stared at him intently, and Qin Yu was even more shocked.

This Semi-Saint didn’t show his true strength at all. He didn’t take Qin Yu’s attack seriously as if he was playing with him!

“Don’t waste time. We have to take him down as soon as possible!” Gu Xinghe, not far away, urged.

Hearing this, the Semi-Saint smiled.

“I’ve wanted to play with you, but I don’t seem have much time. Let’s end this quickly,” the Semi-Saint said coldly.

Qin Yu had an ominous premonition. He certainly dared not hide any of his strength. He displayed all his techniques instantly to raise his strength to the peak forcefully.

Then the Semi-Saint raised his palms.

Just by raising his palms, traces of Holy Power were spreading!

Although it was only a wisp, it still caused people’s faces to change drastically!

“Semi-Saint… actually has Holy Power!” Qin Yu had a sense of impending doom.

He gritted his teeth and hurriedly raised his hand. A star quickly condensed in his palm.

This technique was the Star Seal, a terrifying existence no weaker than the Immortal Emperor’s technique!

A huge star was constantly illusioned and fomed in Qin Yu’s hand. Compared to the last time he used it, the Star Seal’s illusion this time was more complete. One could even see the rough outline of the star!

Anyone who could tell this technique would be shocked!

It was because this illusioned Star Seal actually came from the blue star on the other side!

“In the face of true power, all techniques are useless,” the Semi-Saint said coldly.

He flipped his palm, and a powerful pressure inexplicably came forward!

Qin Yu felt like he was carrying a mountain on her shoulders, and her body was almost crushed!

It was the true Holy Power, the crushing power of dao techniques and rules!

It was not an exaggeration to say no Reversion Void Stage cultivator could resist the Holy Power. It was simply the power of rules!

Qin Yu’s body was constantly being crushed. He desperately tried to use the Star Seal to destroy this wisp of Holy Powert!

Unfortunately, although the Star Seal was powerful, it was not a technique of the Immortal Emperor. It was still within the rules!

Therefore, the illusioned star collapsed in just a few seconds!

Qin Yu’s body was constantly being crushed, and cracking sounds came from all parts of his body!

No matter how hard Qin Yu tried to resist, he could not resist the power of the Holy Power!

“Ah!”

...

Just as Qin Yu was about to be crushed, a golden light speedily flew out from his glabella!

The golden light turned into a sharp blade and swiftly slashed at the Semi-Saint!

“What?”

The Semi-Saint’s expression changed, and he hurriedly shot away to a distant place!

Qin Yu seized the opportunity to break free and jump into the air.

“A divine sense spell? You have some ability.” The Semi-Saint’s face was getting colder.

Although he was in the Semi-Saint realm, he would be seriously injured, if not dead, hitting by this divine sense blade

Qin Yu was not in the mood to listen to his nonsense. The golden light returned to his glabella, and he took the opportunity to catch his breath.

“The Holy Power would sweep away the Reversion Void Stage cultivators. It is the rule of heaven and earth and cannot be broken. No matter how many times you try, you will still lose,” the Semi-Saint sneered and said.

Qin Yu’s face was covered in sweat. This battle was obviously incredibly difficult for him.

“Something’s wrong… If the Holy Power is the rules of heaven and earth, how did Jue Wu kill a Semi-Saint…” Qin Yu suddenly remembered the scene when Jue Wu fought with the Semi-Saint of the Yao family.

...

Although Qin Yu didn’t personally witness the battle, the Semi-Saint had indeed died at the hands of Jue Wu.

In that case, the Holy Power sweeping away the Reversion Void Stage cultivators was not a true rule, or at least there was a loophole.

“Magical artifact? Don’t tell me it’s because of Jue Wu’s magical artifact?” Qin Yu murmured.

“Qin Yu, go to hell!” While Qin Yu was thinking, the Semi-Saint raised his hand again and pressed toward Qin Yu!

The Holy Power quickly spread out and lingered over Qin Yu’s head, trying to crush him again!
