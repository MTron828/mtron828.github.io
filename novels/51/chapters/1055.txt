Chapter 1056: Chapter 1,056, five-petaled Lotus! 

In an instant, the black flame began to burn!

Gu Zizhen’s fingers moved, and the black flame began to stir rapidly, as if it wanted to grind Qin Yu’s body into pieces!

“Chi La Chi La!”

At this moment, a series of strange sounds came from within the Black Flame!

Following that, a blue light shot into the sky, and lightning tore apart the Black Flame!

This was the heavenly tribulation that Qin Yu had collected. It contained the true power of the Great Dao, and it actually directly tore apart the Black Flame!

Qin Yu shot out explosively from within, and a golden light shot straight towards Gu Zizhen’s chest!

Gu Zizhen didn’t have the time to be shocked, and hurriedly raised his hand to deal with it.

However, with just his physical body, Qin Yu wouldn’t be able to meet an opponent under a mighty figure, let alone this Gu Zizhen!

The moment they touched, half of Gu Zizhen’s arm was directly shaken into a bloody mist!

He hurriedly shot backwards and stood at a high place, coldly looking at Qin Yu!

“Looks like you’re not much either. I’ve overestimated you,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“If I had known this would happen, I would have led my people to directly attack the second secret realm earlier.”

These words undoubtedly made Gu Zizhen feel humiliated! As the Realm Master of the second secret realm, he had never been afraid of anyone!

Looking around, this place had completely turned into a battlefield!

Blood rained down from the sky, and the air was filled with the strong smell of blood!

“Everything will be destroyed!”

At this moment, Gu Zizhen’s killing intent suddenly rose. Tens of thousands of rays of light instantly arrived, as if they came from the horizon!

The aura of internal Qi of destruction turned into a miniature version of the second secret realm, trapping Qin Yu inside.

This was a spell of the Great Dao, born in accordance with the Heavenly Dao. It seemed to want to devour Qin Yu and turn him into a part of the second mystic realm!

Qin Yu, who did not understand what was going on, was instantly severely injured. The power of his life seemed to be rapidly sucked out by the miniature version of the second mystic realm! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Qin Yu did not dare to think too much. He roared angrily and raised his fist to punch out. The powerful force caused the miniature version of the second mystic realm to tremble violently, as if it was going to collapse at any moment!

“It’s useless.”Gu Zizhen seemed to be extremely confident. He shot out beams of terrifying light and fell into this narrow space, trapping Qin Yu firmly to death!

Even Qin Yu felt a trace of panic when he saw such a terrifying spell.

Without any time to think, Qin Yu raised his hand and smashed his fist into the four walls!

“Bang!”

With all his strength, his right fist exploded, even if it was a secret technique that was born with the Great Dao!

The explosive power even exploded through Qin Yu’s body!

The bloody pieces of flesh fell to the ground and instantly turned into nothingness!

“What a terrifying punch!”Gu Zizhen could not help but be shocked.

If that punch had landed on his body, it would have shattered his body!

At this moment, Gu Zizhen began to believe Zhai Xing’s words.

The Qin Yu in front of him was not an ordinary martial saint! His strength was not inferior to his!

“Life-ending shock!”

As a top-tier martial saint, Gu Zizhen naturally would not give up.

Each of his moves seemed to be related to the Great Dao. As he lightly opened his mouth, waves of internal Qi of destruction covered him.

This was an extremely terrifying technique of decay. Wherever it touched, all living things would turn into nothingness, becoming the dust of the second mystic realm!

Qin Yu’s finger was only contaminated by the internal Qi that was emitted, and his entire finger instantly lost the ability to move!

He did not dare to think too much and hurriedly blew up half of his finger. Then, he turned around and punched out.

Gu Zizhen let out a furious roar. Light gathered in front of him and blocked the punch.

The battle went on endlessly. Both sides had brought out their trump cards. Both of their Qi and blood had reached their limits, but there was no victor!

Both of them were extremely shocked. Neither of them had expected that the other party’s strength would be so powerful!

“This Gu Zizhen is only one realm higher than Zhai Xing, but the difference in strength is so great!”Qin Yu thought in his heart.

Compared to Zhai Xing, Gu Zizhen’s strength was even more terrifying!

Both sides had exchanged thousands of moves, but Qin Yu still could not figure out Gu Zizhen’s true strength.

This was enough to prove that he still had many trump cards hidden on him!

“Bang!”

Right at this moment, Gu Zizhen seemed to have summoned an object from beyond the heavens!

It was a blood-stained Phoenix that blotted out the sky and covered the earth as it crushed over!

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. The Blood Phoenix that was whistling over sent him flying hundreds of meters away, and his entire body was embedded into the ground!

Then, the Blood Phoenix’s body lowered its heavy internal Qi!

Even Qin Yu’s physical body was unable to resist it, and it almost crushed it!

His internal organs were squeezed, and Qin Yu immediately spat out blood from his mouth!

“Absolute beginning nine slashes!”

At this critical moment, the others took out their bronze swords and raised their hands to slash!

The sharp blade that cut through the sky seemed to have split the sky into two, and even the Blood Phoenix into two!

After the internal Qi dissipated, Qin Yu held his sword and rose up. His entire body was covered in blood that scattered on the ground. It was a tragic sight.

Looking at the battlefield again, the two sides seemed to have entered a stalemate!

Although the immortal crane had made a move, Gu Zizhen had used a secret treasure to restrain these martial saints from the demon city!

This secret treasure was a gift from the higher-ups. It was a treasure of the same level as the soul bell. At this moment, it was resurrecting on its own, making it impossible for the immortal crane and the others to escape!

Just as Qin Yu had guessed, this was an anxious battle. It was impossible for it to end in a short period of time!

Gu Zizhen’s strength was even stronger than he had imagined. Most importantly, he still had a treasure in his hands!

At this moment, the sky turned dark. The battle had already lasted for several hours. If they continued fighting, it would only increase the casualties.

“Hu!”

However, Qin Yu wanted to retreat, but Gu Zizhen wanted to leave Qin Yu here completely!

A pitch-black treasure appeared in his hands!

This was a five-petaled lotus. The moment it was taken out, everyone on the battlefield smelled danger!

The internal Qi emitted from the Lotus was unusual. It was an internal Qi that Qin Yu had never felt before!

“Today, I will kill you. I will let you know the consequences of rebelling against the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”Gu Zizhen revealed a crazed expression. The five-petaled lotus in his hand shone with a mysterious radiance!
