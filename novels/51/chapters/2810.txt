Chapter 2811: Deification

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Xiao Hai shook his head.

“I only have a trace of power left now, so I would like to use the power of the Investiture of Gods in your hand to enter that space.” A hint of fanaticism flashed across Xiao Hail s face. “How do you know about the Investiture of Gods?”

Qin Yu was a little wary.

The main reason was that this was too coincidental. The matter of the Investiture of Gods had just happened.

If Xiao Hai had been living in Heavenly Sin, how could he have known about these things? This was truly illogical.

“I didn’t know at first, but this is the information Elder Tianji gave me. He told me to wait for you here. This is my last chance, so I separated myself from the Heavenly Sin.”

Xiao Hails spirit body trembled and seemed to dim a little.

This was the second time Qin Yu had heard about the Elder Tianji.

He had given him a bow the first time, which was now with Aiden. It also helped him to solve many problems.

He didn’t seem to have any ill intentions towards him. But he couldn’t figure out why he made Xiao Hai wait for him here.

After pondering for a while, Qin Yu still could not tell the role played by Elder Tianji.

However, Elder Tianji should not be his enemy. He raised his head and looked at Xiao Hai.

“Xiao Hai, the incomplete tablet is indeed with me now, but I don’t know anything about it. Moreover, the real owner of the Investiture of Gods is probably searching for me. The most important point is that only one person has escaped since the Primordial Chaos era. Are you sure you want to accept this power?”

“I accept. My soul is no longer complete, that is why I can use the power of the Spacetime Hall without limit. If I can’t hold on to my beliefs, then there’s no point in living anymore. This is also my only chance. Moreover, I might be able to help you if I can successfully enter it.”

Xiao Hai’s voice was very calm. He did not care about what Qin Yu said at all.

“Don’t mention it, Brother Xiao Hai. The power of this Investiture of Gods is very strange. The holder is also a monster derived from it. I wonder if he will detect your abnormality.”

Qin Yu said solemnly.

“Let’s take advantage of the time to study it together.”

“No. This power has just attracted the owner. If I use it for too long, I’m afraid it will attract its attention. Just wait for the last bit of power in my spirit body to be exhausted and directly activate the power of the Investiture of Gods to seal my divine soul. As for the rest, we’ll see if we can contact each other again.”

Xiao Hai shook his head.

“Alright.”

Qin Yu nodded. He did not continue to dissuade Xiao Hai seeing that he had already made up his mind.

“Qin Yu, you must cultivate the peak power. This is your next mission. It is indeed difficult for you to cultivate the peak power in your current state. However, there will be a power that can destroy the world when you come out. Only then will you have the qualifications to fight for a position in the future and even take back Ruoxue.”

Xiao Hai said indifferently.

“Kill.”

“Kill?”

Qin Yu muttered. He was temporarily unable to understand the meaning of the word.

There were some methods of killing people, such as sending them to their deaths.

Only by fighting for that sliver of hope would one be able to put their life on the line.

Xiao Hai’s spirit body was like a candle about to burn out. It turned illusory at a speed visible to the naked eye.

As if a bubble had burst, Xiao Hai’s soul was between existence and inexistence.

“Dodge!”

Qin Yu said to the three of them.

Qin Yu suddenly took out the Investiture of Gods. A wave of power flashed.

This was the power of the Investiture of Gods that had dragged Qin Yu’s divine soul into it.

The moment this power lit up, Xiao Hai’s soul power took the initiative to rush into it.

In the next moment, his divine soul had already entered it.

Xiao Hai’s name slowly appeared on the Dage-

Next, Xiao Hail s birth characters appeared.

When all the information was drawn, it meant Xiao Hail s divine soul completely belonged to the Investiture of Gods.

The blood words slowly slid on the Investiture of Gods. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

When the last stroke was about to land, something strange happened. A force was born from the brush.

“Oh no! It’s the power of Heavenly Sin!”

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically.

Xiao Hai’s divine soul was now residing in the Heavenly Sin, or to a certain extent, he could be considered a part of the Heavenly Sin.

At this moment, this divine soul was about to be absorbed into the Investiture of Gods. It also caused the resistance of the Heavenly Sin.

The two forces instantly collided.

“Qin Yu, activate the power of the Investiture of Gods and seal me! Hurry!”

Xiao Hai shouted anxiously. This was the first time Qin Yu had seen him so anxious.

He did not hesitate to pour all his power into the Investiture of Gods.

At this moment, the remnant page of the Investiture of Gods once again emitted a touch of power. Although it was only a remnant page, it was still much stronger than the power that Heavenly Sin had instilled into him.

In an instant, Heavenly Sin’s power was completely defeated. The power of the Investiture of Gods sucked Xiao Hai’s divine soul into it.

“Run! The three of you, run! I’m afraid the power of Heavenly Sin just now will attract some attention. Qin Yu, your divine soul has to return to the space of the Investiture of Gods immediately.”

A thought fluctuation came from the Investiture of Gods and Xiao Hai’s voice came from it.

A golden light enveloped the three of them. A golden light burst out from Fatty Situ’s body and the three of them disappeared at lightning speed.

Qin Yu also activated the Investiture of Gods and sent that wisp of divine sense into it.

Qin Yu, who was in the space of Investiture of Gods, suddenly grabbed the tablet.

When he entered this place, the Investiture of Gods would also appear here.

In an instant, his body became a little sluggish. Not long after, a hand had already landed on his body.

Qin Yu’s blood, muscles, and bones were completely broken down into the most primitive state.

Nothing could escape the observation of the consciousness. After an unknown period, the power of the Investiture of Gods completely receded.

“It’s the Investiture of Gods! How did you get such an item?” After Qin Yu entered, Smoker Xie’s body started to tremble violently.

“I beg you! I beg you!’

At this moment, Smoker Xie suddenly knelt on the ground like a drug addict who had broken out.

“If I can find a safe way one day, I will take you away!”

Qin Yu was silent for a long time before he finally replied.

Smoker Xie’s warning had helped him a lot. Otherwise, if he moved the incomplete version of the Investiture of Gods and escaped, he would probably be sensed by the true body of the tablet very quickly. At that time, he would be consigned to eternal damnation.

“Smoker Xie, what do we need to do to escape?”

Qin Yu had a headache. Entering this place was equivalent to having an additional eye installed.

He couldn’t make any drastic changes whether inside or outside, or he might activate the commandment..
