Chapter 734: The Vicious Granny Qin Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Granny Qin, should we kill him?” The purple-robed men asked.

Granny Qin said with a gloomy expression, “No, I have a bet with him. We can’t kill him.”

At this point, Granny Qin paused, then said with a sinister expression, “Although we can’t kill him, we can still consider crippling him... if he wants to get his hands on ten-thousand-year-old herbs, dream on!”

...

On the other side, Qin Yu knew nothing about this.

At this moment, all he could think of was how to get the Tang family to help.

It was probably impossible to rely on flattery and praise.

Although the Tang family’s father and son liked to be praised, it didn’t mean that they were fools.

“What I can give them doesn’t seem to be much,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Other than his identity as an apothecary, Qin Yu had almost nothing to offer.

However, Qin Yu had no other choice. He could only place his hopes on the Tang family.

The car sped all the way. He wanted to rush to the island feast.

He thought that the island feast would be a feast, but he didn’t expect it to be a club.

This club was extremely high-end. The entire club was placed under the sea.

Looking out of the club, one could see the blue sea. One could even see schools of fish swimming around.

When they reached the entrance of the clubhouse, the security guard reached out to stop Qin Yu.

“Sir, we have a membership system and it isn’t open to the public,” said the security guard.

“I’m here to look for Tang Mo. He asked me to come,” said Qin Yu as he pointed inside.

The security guard looked Qin Yu up and down and said, “Are you Qin Yu?”

“That’s right.” Qin Yu nodded.

A trace of surprise flashed through the security guard’s eyes. He grabbed Qin Yu’s arm and said, “Mr. Qin, I’m your fan! I think what you did was too cool!”

Then, the security guard praised Qin Yu. He almost described everything that Qin Yu had done. The more he talked, the more excited he became.

“I’m sorry, I have something to discuss with Young Master Tang. Can I go in now?” Helpless, Qin Yu could only interrupt the security guard.

The security guard hurriedly nodded and said, “Mr. Qin, please come in. Can we have a meal together when you’re done?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Of course, no problem. I’ll treat you to a meal later.”

The security guard was immediately overjoyed. He said with some anticipation, “Okay, I’ll wait for you!”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more and quickly walked in.

The entire club was flashing with blue light.

In the center of the hall, Tang Mo was sitting there.

He lazily leaned on the sofa with a table full of wine in front of him.

Qin Yu quickly walked over and said in surprise, “Why are you alone today? Where are the more than twenty Martial Marquises?”

Tang Mo sat up from the sofa and waved his hand, “I just came out to have fun. I don’t need such a big show.”

After saying that, Tang Mo handed Qin Yu a bottle of wine and said, “Come, have a drink with me.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything else. He raised his glass and downed it.

After Qin Yu finished the bottle of wine, Tang Mo said, “Why are you looking for me? Just tell me.”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment and said, “I do have something that I need your help with.”

“It’s still because of that ten-thousand-year-old herb, isn’t it?” Tang Mo said casually.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “That’s right. The news of the birth of this medicinal herb has already been leaked. When that time comes, who knows how many people will be eyeing this medicinal herb?”

Tang Mo snorted lightly and said, “That’s because the Tang family won’t make a move. Otherwise, who would dare to touch it?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “That’s only natural. If the Tang family makes a move, I’m afraid that everyone will give up.”

After a round of bragging, Tang Mo’s face was filled with a proud smile.

He gulped down a bottle of wine and said, “Tell me, what do you want me to do?”

Qin Yu said somewhat embarrassedly, “I think... if it’s convenient for the Tang family, it’s best if you guys can lend me some manpower...”

“Lend you some manpower?” Tang Mo raised his eyebrows.

He shook the wine cup in his hand and said indifferently, “Qin Yu, you should know that the emergence of these herbs will attract a large number of powerhouses.”

“Once a big fight breaks out, casualties are inevitable. Even a Martial Marquis might die.”

“Do you think our relationship is so close that we can sacrifice our family’s Martial Marquised for you?” Tang Mo stared at Qin Yu and said.

Qin Yu immediately fell into silence.

Although Tang Mo didn’t have a proper career, he wasn’t a fool.

Sacrificing his family’s Martial Marquises for the sake of Qin Yu, who he just met, wasn’t worth it no matter how he looked at it.

“There are some things where it’s best if you can get them, but if you can’t get them, you don’t have to force things.” Tang Mo leaned back and was quite free and easy.

Qin Yu sighed and said, “If I had the time, I wouldn’t be in such a hurry.”

Qin Yu only had a month’s time. If he couldn’t get this ten-thousand-year-old herbs, he had no chance of winning against the Heaven Swallowing Python.

Tang Mo waved his hand and said, “Alright, let’s not talk about this anymore. I think my father has already made it clear to you.”

“If the Tang family can’t help you, at least you still have a chance to get it. Don’t expect too much.”

Qin Yu could only sigh slightly and said, “Alright then.”

“Come, let’s drink. We must enjoy life to the fullest,” Tang Mo said with a smile.

Qin Yu had no other choice but to drink with Tang Mo..

In the center of the clubhouse, a few hot girls were dancing. Although the atmosphere was lively, it wasn’t considered noisy.

At this moment, Granny Qin arrived at the entrance of the island feast.

“Granny Qin, Qin Yu should be here.” A purple-robed person bowed and said.

Granny Qin nodded and walked into the island feast with a cold expression.

At the entrance, the security guard was still immersed in the joy of seeing his idol.

Seeing Granny Qin walking over, the security guard hurriedly took a step forward and blocked Granny Qin’s way.

“I’m sorry, we have a membership system here. It’s not open to the public,” the security guard said politely.

Granny Qin coldly glanced at the security guard and said, “Don’t give yourself trouble.”

The security guard tried his best to smile and said, “Sorry, this is the rule of the island feast. None members aren’t allowed to enter.”

“You’re courting death!” Granny Qin was instantly enraged. She stretched out her shriveled claws and grabbed the security guard’s head!

“Crack!”

With a crisp sound, the security guard’s head was directly snapped off!

The security guard’s eyes widened. Until death, he never expected that Granny Qin would be so vicious! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Granny Qin snorted coldly and then strode into the island feast.

At the island feast, Qin Yu was drinking with Tang Mo, but his mind was filled with thoughts of how to ensure that he could obtain this ten-thousand-year-old herb.

At this moment, several figures appeared in front of Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, you seem to have a lot of time on your hands.” A sinister voice sounded in Qin Yu’s ear.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He raised his head and saw Granny Qin standing in front of him.

The purple-robed men beside her blocked his way.
