Chapter 1397: Chapter 1397, the Furious Great Elder 1

Just as Brother Dao had described, his body was extremely huge. His entire body was wrapped in a thick fog.

The thick fog surged in all directions. From the looks of it, this aura seemed to be coming from his body.

Qin Yu’s eyes coldly looked at the huge creature. Although his body was wrapped in a thick fog, he could not hide under Qin Yu’s desolate God eyes.

“It’s him,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“HMM? What are you talking about?”Brother Dao did not seem to understand what Qin Yu meant.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Brother Dao, wait for me here. I’ll be back soon.”

Brother Dao pulled Qin Yu back and said, “Can you do it on your own?”

“Don’t worry. I’ve dealt with this thing before,”Qin Yu said coldly.

With that, he charged straight into the thick fog.

This green creature was much larger than the one Qin Yu had encountered before, so its strength was naturally much stronger.

Coupled with the terrifying aura on its body, even Qin Yu was a little afraid at this moment. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“You’ve seen this thing before?”At this moment, Iron Egg’s voice sounded in his mind.

Qin Yu said coldly, “I thought you were dead.”

Iron Egg ignored Qin Yu’s words and said, “This creature is very strange. It was known as the hand of death back then, but no one knows its origin.”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “What do you know?”

Iron Egg kept silent, as if he wanted to play dead again.

“I’m telling you, if I die, you have to die too,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Hearing this, iron egg finally opened his mouth.

He said in a deep voice, “I don’t know much about this thing. Most of them are just rumors. I can only tell you that it’s best not to get involved with this thing. Stay as far away from it as possible.”

Qin Yu snorted and said, “Do you think I have any other choice? I’ve already discovered that wherever there is life qi, this thing will definitely appear.”

Of course, the flying spider was an exception.

Although Qin Yu did not know the reason, he firmly believed in his own opinion.

In order to recover his spiritual power, no matter how big the risk, Qin Yu had to give it a try.

Iron Egg did not say anything more. He did not have a body, so he could only leave it to fate.

Qin Yu walked towards the green creature. This thing was called the hand of death. Although Qin Yu did not know why it got this name, this name was deeply imprinted in Qin Yu’s mind.

Seeing that he was getting closer and closer to the hand of death, the fear in his heart grew stronger.

Qin Yu felt a strong pressure. This pressure was several times stronger than the one he had encountered in the Yangcheng mountain range.

“I’m afraid that it will be a fierce battle,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

However, during this period of time, Qin Yu’s strength had also increased. His physical body had undergone an extremely strong transformation, so Qin Yu was also confident in his heart.

While Qin Yu was searching for the water of life, the first elder had already begun his investigation.

With his ability, he quickly figured everything out.

“The reason why Qin Yu took such a big risk to come to Gu city must be because he heard that the Heavenly Cloud sect was planning to kill his companion,”the first elder said coldly while sitting in the Elder’s mansion.

“He came here but didn’t take anyone away, and Di Zun asked me for Zhen Yue and the others at this time. This proves that Qin Yu and Di Zun have already met,”the first elder concluded.

His face became colder and colder, and a burst of anger erupted.

In front of the first elder were three elders with long beards.

These three were all at the peak of the Almighty Realm, and they were also the guest elders of the Heavenly Cloud sect.

The Heavenly Cloud sect rarely summoned the guest elders unless it was something important. However, they were summoned all of a sudden, which showed the seriousness of the matter.

“The three of you, go to Gu City immediately and find a sister Lin from the auction.”The great elder took a deep breath.

The three of them bowed and said, “Yes, Great Elder.”

With that, the three of them slowly disappeared from this space.

The great elder stood up and walked toward the cultivation room.

In the cultivation room, Di Zun was cultivating in seclusion.

The great elder suddenly opened the door roughly and Strode in.

Di Zun was startled awake. He looked at the Great Elder in surprise and said, “Master, why are you here?”

The great elder didn’t say anything. He just bent his finger.

Di Zun’s body immediately rushed toward the great elder uncontrollably!

The great elder grabbed Di Zun’s neck and said coldly, “You have met Qin Yu, haven’t You?”

Di Zun panicked, but he still tried his best to deny, “No, who are you listening to this nonsense...”

“No? You Dare to lie to me? !”The great elder increased the strength of his hand again. Di Zun’s face immediately turned red and he found it hard to breathe!

“Tell me! How did you meet Qin Yu? !”The Great Elder said coldly.

Di Zun gritted his teeth. He knew clearly that the great elder must have no evidence, or else he would not interrogate him like this!

“I. . . Don’t...”Di Zun said with difficulty.

The first elder narrowed his eyes and let go of Di Zun.

He put his hands behind his back and sneered, “Alright, since you said you don’t have any evidence, then I’ll believe you.”

Di Zun panted heavily and heaved a sigh of relief.

But at this moment, the first elder changed the topic and sneered, “To show your loyalty, hand over Zhen Yue and the others.”

Di Zun’s heart sank again.

“Master... Master, what... What do you want them for? Their cultivation is very low, and Qin Yu won’t care about them at all. You...”Di Zun wanted to use his excuse, but it failed this time.

The first elder sneered, “I don’t care whether Qin Yu will care about them or not. I only care whether you are loyal to the heavenly cloud sect or not.”

“Either you hand them over, or you die with them!”

Di Zun stood there with a dead face.

He didn’t know what to do next.

“You know that if I want to kill them, you can’t Stop Me,”the Great Elder said indifferently.

“I’m giving you a chance now!”

Di Zun’s face was as dark as water and he didn’t say a word.

He had promised Qin Yu that he would protect these people, but he didn’t expect that an accident would happen in the end.

“Okay, you don’t have to say anymore.”The great elder waved his hand. “Wait for death with them!”

After saying this, the great elder turned around and walked out.
