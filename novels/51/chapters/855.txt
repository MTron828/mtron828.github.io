Chapter 856: Chapter 856, setting up a killing formation

After sending this message, Qin Yu lay on his bed and fell into a deep sleep.

During this period of time, Qin Yu had almost never rested, so he slept extremely well that night.

However, a huge commotion had already been stirred up on the martial arts forum.

This news almost instantly swept through the entire martial arts world.

“Qin Yu is openly challenging the various aristocratic families.”

“TSK TSK, the key is to directly name the person in charge of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

“Could it be that this person has already entered the martial saint realm? Otherwise, why would he be so arrogant?”

Meanwhile, in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, Gu Xinghe also saw this news.

His face was full of anger, and veins popped up on his forehead.

“Damn it!”Gu Xinghe threw the phone in his hand onto the ground.

“This Qin Yu, announce my name, publicly provoke him!”

“I’m going to kill him right now, I must kill him!”

Looking at the furious Gu Xinghe, long brows could not help but tremble.

“Young master, you’d better be careful. If this kid steps into the martial saint realm, then he’s not someone we can provoke,”long brows said.

As long as he stepped into the martial saint realm, not to mention Gu Xinghe, even the entire second mystic realm would have to think twice!

“I don’t believe he has stepped into the martial saint realm,”Gu Xinghe said coldly.

Long Mei saw that he could not persuade Gu Xinghe, so he changed the topic and said, “Young master, it’s almost the New Year. It’s time for you to return to the second mystic realm.”

Hearing this, Gu Xinghe was obviously stunned, and his emotions seemed to have calmed down a lot.

He sat down on the chair and said in a low voice: “It is indeed time for the new year... . .”

As a member of the Yan country, he still attached great importance to the New Year.

Especially for Gu Zi Zhen, who was an old and stubborn man, he naturally attached great importance to the traditional festivals.

“I reckon it won’t be long before your father will recruit you back.”Long Mei continued to strike while the iron was hot.

Gu Xing he took a deep breath and said: “Alright, then let him live for a few more days.”

Upon seeing this, Long Mei also let out a sigh of relief.

Gu Xinghe said with a cold face, “But we can’t let him be so arrogant. Go, publicly respond and say that we’ll let him live for a few more days. His actions have thoroughly angered the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

Long Mei hurriedly nodded and said, “No problem, I’ll respond right away.”

...

That night, it snowed heavily in the sky.

This heavy snow covered almost half of the north.

The world was silent. Qin Yu lay on his bed and slept like a dead pig.

However, tonight’s martial arts forum was extremely lively.

Other than Qin Yu’s public provocation and the JINGDU martial arts association’s response, there was another piece of news.

A person who called himself “Tian Jizi”posted a prediction on the martial arts forum:

Someone would step into the Martial Saint Realm next year and change the current environment.

This news made the martial arts forum, which had almost erupted, even more lively.

“Someone is going to step into the martial saint realm? Who could it be? Qin Yu? Yan Jinyao? or Gu Xinghe from the mystic realm?”

“Have you all forgotten that the veteran Marquis Wu, Ye Qing, Jiang, Kong Yun, and the others are still alive?”

“TSK TSK, the martial arts forum is going to be lively next year.”

At this moment, Qin Yu was still sleeping soundly and even had a sweet dream.

The next morning.

Qin Yu got out of bed.

He took out his phone and opened the martial arts forum.

Seeing the countless messages, Qin Yu couldn’t help but be a little surprised.

Soon, Qin Yu saw Gu Xinghe’s reply.

“Your actions have thoroughly angered the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. After this year, the next year will be your death date. Of course, you can use these few days to escape.”

Seeing this message, Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh.

He thought about it and replied, “Gu Xinghe, even if you don’t come looking for me, I will come looking for you.”

Putting away his phone, Qin Yu’s expression instantly became extremely cold.

He didn’t plan to have a stable new year.

To the fatherless Qin Yu, this so-called traditional festival was no different from an ordinary day.

He got up and walked out of the room, then left the Divine Medicine Pavilion.

It wasn’t until evening that Qin Yu rushed back, worn out from travel.

His body was wet from the heavy snow, but his body was emitting heat.

“Where did you go?”Seeing Qin Yu rush back, the Pavilion Master couldn’t help but be somewhat surprised.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I went to buy some things. Lord Pavilion Master, do you want to go back for the New Year?”

The pavilion master shook his head and said, “This is my home.”

Qin Yu was speechless. He didn’t say anything more. Instead, he took out the materials one by one from the spatial god tool.

These materials looked quite ordinary, but the pavilion master, who was well-informed, could tell their uses at a glance.

“Are these the materials to set up the formation?”The pavilion master asked curiously.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, I plan to set up a killing formation near the Medicine God Pavilion.”

The pavilion master said with some surprise, “You know how to set up a Killing Formation?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Of course.”

Then, Qin Yu took out a total of four martial saint weapons.

These four martial saint weapons were all snatched by Qin Yu!

“You...”when the pavilion master saw this scene, he could not help but be stunned.

When did the martial saint weapons become so worthless?

“I used these four martial saint weapons as killing weapons to set up the killing formation.”

“When the time comes, you will be the one controlling it. Even if a half-step martial saint stepped into it, he would die without a doubt.”Qin Yu said coldly.

Looking at Qin Yu, who was thin and had a determined look in his eyes, the pavilion master was a little absent-minded for a moment.

The young man who had relied on his protection a year ago had now grown to such an extent.

Qin Yu did not waste any time. He braved the heavy snow and spent an entire night to set up a killing formation around the huge divine medicine pavilion.

The next morning, Qin Yu stood at the highest point of the divine medicine pavilion as if he was sizing something up. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Has the killing formation been set up?”The pavilion master walked to Qin Yu’s side.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “If you want the formation to be perfect, you need one more thing.”

“What?”The pavilion master asked.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “Qiankun Stone.”

“Qiankun Stone?”Upon hearing this name, the pavilion master could not help but turn pale with fright.

Qiankun stone was an extremely rare material. Currently, only the Heaven’s secret pavilion knew about it publicly.

And the pavilion of Heavenly Secrets treated the heaven and earth stone as if it was a family heirloom. Usually, not to mention giving it to others, they couldn’t even take it out to have a look.

“Where are you going to get the Heaven and Earth Stone?”The pavilion master asked.

Qin Yu said coldly, “The pavilion of Heavenly Secrets.”

“They won’t give it to you.”The pavilion master shook his head and said.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “They have to give it even if they don’t want to. This is what they owe me!”

“Owe you?”The pavilion master was even more puzzled.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “They owe me a life, so use this Qiankun Stone to pay me back.”

As he said this, Qin Yu spat out another mouthful of blood.

The blood dyed the snow on the ground red, making it look shocking.
