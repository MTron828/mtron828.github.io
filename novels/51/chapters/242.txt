Chapter 243: None Of Your Business, None Of My Business Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Such a grand scene immediately attracted countless gazes.

Everyone stopped in their tracks and turned their heads to look.

Even Qin Yu was no exception.

A young man stepped out of the helicopter. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The young man had an extraordinary appearance and a graceful bearing.

Behind him were two old men.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and glanced at the young man.

“Inner Strength Master Hands?”

This surprised Qin Yu greatly.

An Inner Strength Master Hands dared to covet this Divine Medicine? Wasn’t he afraid of dying here?

Could it be that he wasn’t an ordinary Inner Strength Master Hands like himself?

“He’s Han Yilong, who’s from the Han family’s side branch.” At this moment, Fang Yue suddenly said.

“The Han Family?” Qin Yu’s pupils suddenly dilated!

He hurriedly looked at Fang Yue beside him and said, “Is it the Han family from Jingdu?”

Fang Yue said with some surprise, “Mr. Qin, do you know the Han family?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, I’ve heard of them.”

Fang Yue smiled and said, “He is indeed from the Han family, but the Han family is big and has more than ten side branches. Han Yilong is from one of them.”

“I see.” Qin Yu nodded slightly.

“Miss Fang, what about Han Wei?” Qin Yu continued to ask.

Fang Yue said in surprise, “Han Wei? He is the eldest young master of the Han family! His status isn’t something that Han Yilong can compare to!”

“Han Wei can be considered Han Yilong’s cousin.”

Qin Yu didn’t speak anymore.

He had never thought that he would run into someone from the Han family here.

Soon, Han Yilong walked over with the two elders behind him.

They were both Inner Strength Master Hands, but their attitudes were completely different.

“Young Master Han, I didn’t expect you to come.” The one who took the lead was Zhang Hua, who had a grudge with Qin Yu.

He changed his attitude and flattered, “We are very honored to meet you, Young Master Han!”

Han Yilong glanced at him and sneered. “Even you martial artists can come, so why can’t I come?”

“Yes, yes, yes.” Zhang Hua didn’t dare to say anything more and nodded repeatedly.

Han Yilong stretched his body and glanced at the crowd while saying indifferently, “Listen up, I’m Han Yilong of the Han family. If you’re sensible and give me the Divine Medicine obediently, the Han family might still remember this favor.”

At this point, Han Yilong paused for a moment. Then, he changed the topic and sneered. “Of course, those who are unwilling can try to fight against the Han family.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the two old men behind him immediately erupted with a powerful internal qi!

A terrifying pressure immediately pressed over!

A third level Inner Strength Grandmaster!

Han Yilong had indeed come prepared!

Everyone’s expression changed slightly.

Although these people had a high status in the Jiang Bei region, they were nothing compared to the Han family!

After all, in modern society, the power of wealth far surpassed that of a martial artist!

The crowd was silent as everyone looked at each other.

“Why?!” At this moment, a young man suddenly stood out!

He glared at Han Yilong and shouted, “The Divine Medicine is a gift from nature. Whoever gets it fairly will get it. Even if you’re a member of the Han family, you can’t be so overbearing!”

When they heard the young man’s words, everyone couldn’t help but feel shocked!

“Oh really?” Han Yilong raised his eyebrows and a cold light flashed in his eyes.

In the next second, the old man behind him took a step forward and waved his big hand!

Boom!

A terrifying force instantly came from the air and smashed the young man into pieces!

“Who else is unconvinced?” Han Yilong glanced at the crowd and sneered.

The crowd was completely silent.

“It’s our honor to... to be able to serve Young Master Han!” Zhang Hua shouted!

With Zhang Hua taking the lead, the others also shouted, “Since Young Master Han wants it, we can only give it to him.”

Han Yilong nodded.

He was quite satisfied with everyone’s attitude.

Of course, there were naturally some who weren’t satisfied.

For example, the four great geniuses of the Jiang Bei region.

A Divine Medicine had an extraordinary meaning. They were naturally unwilling to give it to him just like that!

However, they didn’t dare to confront Han Yilong directly. They could only curse him inside.

“Han Yilong is really overbearing.” Jing Lu couldn’t help but grit his teeth.

“Sigh, it can’t be helped. After all, he is a member of the Han family.” Duan Shi also curled his lips.

Seeing the attitude of the crowd, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a bit disdainful.

The crowd that was still clamoring about justice just a moment ago all looked dejected now.

“What bullsh * t martial artists? They are just a bunch of people who are trying to curry favor with the powerful.” Qin Yu snorted inside.

“Mr. Qin, since the members of the Han family are here, I’m afraid we won’t have the chance to get this Divine Medicine. How about...” Jiang Gu said in a low voice.

Qin Yu sneered. “I don’t care about the Han family. I want this Divine Medicine!”

Jiang Gu couldn’t help but sigh to himself.

The ignorant were truly fearless.

“Which one of you is called Qin Yu?”

At this moment, Han Yilong suddenly asked indifferently.

When they heard this, everyone’s eyes turned to Qin Yu’s direction.

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

He didn’t expect Han Yilong to come to him.

“Young Master Han, he is!” Zhang Hua hurriedly ran forward and pointed at Qin Yu.

Han Yilong glanced at Zhang Hua and said with satisfaction, “You did well. You’re a good lap dog.”

Zhang Hua didn’t feel humiliated by such insulting words. Instead, he said excitedly, “Thank you for your praise, Young Master Han!”

Han Yilong no longer paid attention to Zhang Hua. He turned to Qin Yu and said, “You, come here.”

Qin Yu stood there without moving an inch. He only looked at Han Yilong coldly.

“Young Master Han asked you to come here. Are you deaf?” Zhang Hua scolded.

Qin Yu sneered. “I have to go over just because he asked me to?”

Zhang Hua was stunned and quickly scolded, “This is the young master of the Han family! It is your honor that he asked you to come here!”

“Honor?” Qin Yu sneered.

“Zhang Hua, if you’re willing to be a lap dog, no one will stop you, but I’m not willing to,” Qin Yu said coldly.

When these words were said, the scene was in an uproar!

They never thought that Qin Yu wouldn’t show the Han family any respect at all!

“You have quite some backbone,” Han Yilong said with narrowed eyes.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said indifferently, “Why are you looking for me?”

Han Yilong slowly walked toward Qin Yu. As he walked, he said, “I heard that you have a good relationship with Yan Ruoxue, the oldest daughter of the Yan Family?”

The oldest daughter of the Yan Family?

The martial artists at the scene suddenly understood!

No wonder Qin Yu was only a Inner Strength Master Hands Hands, but he could be called the King of Chuzhou!

It turned out that he had the Yan family backing him!

“What does it have to do with you?” Qin Yu snorted lightly.

Han Yilong’s expression changed slightly. He said with a cold expression, “Then do you know that my cousin Han Wei has been pursuing Miss Yan?”

“I know, but what does that have to do with me?” Qin Yu sneered.
