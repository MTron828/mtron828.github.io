1757 The Invincibility of Faith!

A terrifying aura swept out, turning everything in its path into dust!

Waves of aftershock forced everyone to retreat. Qin Yu, whose breathing was already weak, was even more shocked until he vomited blood!

Smoke filled the air and blocked everyone’s vision!

Everyone looked at the battlefield nervously. They didn’t know what the result of the collision would be, and they didn’t know if Xiao Hai would survive.

Slowly, the smoke and dust began to dissipate, revealing two figures.

These two people were tall and short, strong and thin!

“Xiao Hai... Xiao Hai actually managed to survive!” At this time, Wen Wanchong was the first to exclaim!

Qin Yu and Qu Zhu also widened their eyes.

“Oh my god, he’s so crazy.” even Jue Wu’s small mouth was wide open, her face full of shock!

Xiao Hai had really taken the hit! in the collision between the two sides, no one actually gained any advantage!

How terrifying was this? A half-step Reversion Void Stage was able to withstand a palm strike from Yuan Xiu!

Yuan Xiu’s expression was icy cold. Once again, he felt the terror of the Xiao brothers!

“Are you really at the half-step Reversion Void Stage?” Yuan Xiu said coldly.

“Yes.” Xiao Hai said concisely.

“Then all the more I can’t let you live!” Yuan Xiu shouted and immediately used all his techniques to charge at Xiao Hai!

The two of them had a huge collision! This part of the world seemed to have become their battlefield!

The two of them didn’t hold back at all, and their terrifying auras shot into the distance. Every time they collided, countless areas would be shattered into pieces!

As Yuan Xiu fought Xiao Hai, they unleashed all kinds of spells. One of them was like a god protecting a world, while the other was like a resurrected demon!

The two of them held different beliefs and had a huge gap in their realms, but under such circumstances, the two of them were fighting each other!

Fresh blood splattered across the sky. Xiao Hai seemed to have been reborn from blood. He had no intention of retreating in the face of the powerful Yuan Xiu. Even though he was covered in blood, he showed no fear!

Yuan Xiu’s respect for Xiao Hai had also reached its peak. This was the only opponent he had respected since he was born. Hence, he used all sorts of trump cards and spells in an attempt to show Xiao Hai the greatest respect!

Xiao Hai was very different from Yuan Xiu. He did not seem to have any spells or techniques. All he had was a destructive fist and a palm that could topple mountains and overturn the seas!

Everyone was shocked by their battle!

Not only Qin Yu and the others, even Sima Bei and He Teng were extremely shocked!

“Were you really as famous as such a person back then?” Sima Bei looked at Yong Ji and said in shock.

Yong Ji gritted his teeth. Although these words were extremely unkind, they didn’t make him feel humiliated.

Because Xiao Hai’s performance was indeed worthy of admiration!

“Nanzhou is truly a land of talents. I’m afraid that the two brothers of the Xiao family can be considered first-class in the entire Holy Region.” He Teng said with emotion.

“Do you still intend to become a Supreme Emperor?” Yuan Xiu snorted.

He Teng was stunned. Then, he said coldly, “This is also my faith. people like you won’t understand it either.”

In the distance, the great battle had already turned white hot. The two of them had already exchanged hundreds of moves!

Xiao Hai, who was only at the half-step Reversion Void Stage, had not been defeated yet, which made everyone feel terrified!

Although he was covered in wounds and bleeding, his internal qi did not weaken at all. Instead, his battle intent became stronger!

“Ah!”

Yuan Xiu roared and unleashed a terrifying dao technique, as if he wanted to use all the dao techniques in this world for himself!

Xiao Hai, on the other hand, did not use any fancy spells. His palm turned into a knife, and in an instant, a golden dragon seemed to appear and merge with his palm.

At this moment, Xiao Hai’s palm was as sharp as a blade, as if it could cut through everything in the world!

“Boom!”

The sharp blade cut through the sky and destroyed Yuan Xiu’s spell!

Following that, Xiao Hai waved his sleeves, and a thick wave of true energy shot towards Yuan Xiu.

Yuan Xiu was not afraid at all. His face was cold and his hands were filled with killing intent!

A terrifying aura gathered in his hand and he drew a semi-circle in the air, forcing Xiao Hai to retreat.

“Xiao Hai, I acknowledge your strength, but I don’t have time to waste with you. I’ve already given you a chance. If you don’t leave, you’ll die here!” Yuan Xiu let out an earth-shattering roar and a terrifying flame ignited in his palm!

Yuan Xiu glided in the air, as if he was deducing some powerful technique!

Countless auras gathered around Yuan Xiu, and the mysterious patterns merged with them!

At this moment, a trace of Holy Power appeared on his palm!

Wisps of Holy Power permeated the air. No one knew what kind of spell Yuan Xiu had used to actually produce such Holy Power!

“Not good!”

Everyone’s expression changed drastically. That aura was frightening!

Before the crowd could even begin to wonder, Yuan Xiu’s palm had already reached forward!

The palm, which was mixed with a trace of Holy Power, pressed down on Xiao Hai like a mountain!

Even Xiao Hai couldn’t take it anymore.

Half of his palm was crushed, and his body was smashed into the ground at an extremely fast speed!

Cracks started to appear on his body as if he was about to collapse!

“How many more terrifying techniques are Yuan Xiu hiding?”

Qin Yu could not help but be shocked! Could this also be a secret technique left behind by the Immortal Slaying Sect?

The power of a True Saint was extremely terrifying. Even a Reversion Void Stage cultivator would not be able to resist it, let alone a half-step Reversion Void Stage cultivator!

Xiao Hai was pressed to the ground, unable to get up, while Yuan Xiu was still performing his spell!

No one knew what kind of terrifying change would happen when the next palm slapped down!

“No, we can’t just sit here and do nothing!” Qin Yu quickly looked at Wen Wanchong and the others.

“Qin Yu is right.” Jue Wu also nodded. Her body was already emitting wisps of purple light.

“Wait!”

At this moment, Qu Zhu suddenly extended his hand to stop the two.

He looked in Xiao Hai’s direction.

Xiao Hai’s body was surrounded by a terrifying aura, and there seemed to be a dragon-like radiance blending with him.

The next second, Xiao Hai shouted. He supported his body with his hands and stood up again!

“What?”

Yuan Xiu’s expression changed slightly, and a trace of doubt flashed across his eyes.

He actually stood up again under the Holy Power? Was he still human?

“Ahh!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xiao Hai roared, and his long hair fluttered in the wind.

He raised his palm and slammed it towards Yuan Xiu with immense force!

This palm was filled with killing intent, Xiao Hai’s confidence in winning, and his endless fighting spirit.

Most importantly, it gave birth to Xiao Hai’s invincible faith!
