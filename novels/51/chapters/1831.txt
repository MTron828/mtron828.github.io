1832 Chang Mang?

Tong Guangqing’s expression was gloomy, and he was even vicious deep down.

“You must not do so.”

Uncle Guan suddenly walked out at this moment.

He was the old man who had accompanied Tong Guangqing to Nanzhou that day.

Although he was not considered powerful, his status in the Tong family was quite high. He was also influential.

!!

“Why?” Tong Guangqing was puzzled and asked.

Uncle Guan said in a deep voice, “Our goal is not to kill Jue Wu. Whether she dies or not, it doesn’t affect us much. As long as she is under our control, that’s enough.

“But if we kill her, will Qin Yu still come to the Tong family? When he’s desperate, he’ll make public the important thing. That won’t be good news for the Tong family.”

After hearing what Uncle Guan had said, Tong Guangqing could only agree, although he was a little unhappy.

“So we’re going to wait for him for a year?” Tong Guangqing said with a gloomy face.

Uncle Guan glanced at Tong Guangqing and said indifferently, “It’s never too late to make things right. We must not rush.

“Moreover, he won’t be able to cause any trouble within a year. If he really goes into closed-door cultivation, he won’t know even if we kill Jue Wu.”

Tong Guangqing snorted coldly and could only nod.

…

Qin Yu, who was in closed-door seclusion, knew nothing about what had happened.

Qin Yu, who was near the immortal grave, was feeling the dao of the Immortal Emperor and the endless dark energy.

The Huangji Buddha Flame was hanging above his head, and it seemed to have fused with him.

As the Huangji Buddha Flame was fading, Qin Yu’s speed of devouring the Huangji Budhha Flame also increased.

It was an extremely long process. No one dared to predict how long it would take.

However, it was very difficult for a cultivator to change anything in a year. In this cultivation realm, even a small breakthrough would take decades or even hundreds of years!

However, regardless the time, there would always be unrestrained geniuses. In just a short year, the Holy Region had given birth to one brilliant star after another.

Thunder Courtyard seemed to have regained its peace, and everyone had resumed their usual lives.

Demon-slaying Peak took up missions every day and listened to dao lectures once a month. The matters related to the Tong family seemed to have become a thing of the past.

And on this day, an uninvited guest had appeared in the usually peaceful Thunder Courtyard.

It was a burly man who looked like an iron tower. He stood at the gate of Thunder Courtyard and was looking around.

“D*mn it. This should be the place,” the burly man muttered.

After confirming it repeatedly, he strode into Thunder Courtyard.

However, just as he stepped in, he was blocked by two cultivators.

Their faces were as cold as ice, and their bodies emitted a chill.

“Who are you? How dare you break into Thunder Courtyard?” one of them said coldly.

“There’s nothing on your door that says ‘no entry’?” the burly man glanced at him.

The two men looked at each other, and then reprimanded him coldly, “Thunder Courtyard is a place where no one can enter at will. This is a common understanding! Are you pretending to be ignorant?”

“F*ck you! What kind of bullsh*t is this? I’ve never heard of it. Cut the crap. I’m here to find someone,” the burly man cursed.

Seeing the burly man not know the rules, the two men stopped talking nonsense and immediately reached out their palms to slap the burly man.

However, the burly man’s body was as tough as black iron. When the palm slapped him, the burly man actually didn’t move at all!

The two of them were shocked. They raised their heads to look at the burly man.

“You guys started it first. So don’t blame me for being impolite!” the burly man said coldly.

After saying that, his body emitted rays of red light. A great battle was about to begin!

The burly man was extremely strong. In just a moment, the two of them were directly sent flying!

“Your ability isn’t good much,” the burly man sneered and said.

He clapped his hands and walked into Thunder Courtyard again.

However, this was Thunder Courtyard, the holy land for cultivators to study. Even the nine great aristocratic families of Zhongzhou would not dare to be so impudent, let alone this burly man who was alone in front of them!

In a short while, a large group of cultivators swarmed into Thunder Courtyard and surrounded him.

The burly man was reckless. Without any delay, he rushed forward, clenching his fists.

His actions naturally shocked the entire Thunder Courtyard. The burly man’s terrifying strength made wave after wave of cultivators retreat!

When things happened had gone beyond their expectations, an internal qi suddenly emerged. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

This internal qi seemed extremely gentle, but it was extremely terrifying. It was like a mountain that instantly fell on the burly man.

No matter how hard the burly man tried, he was helpless.

His body was ruthlessly pressed to the ground, unable to move!

Stepping on an immortal cloud, the old man’s face looked frosty.

“Who are you? How dare you create trouble in Thunder Courtyard?” the old man said coldly.

The burly man on the ground raised his head and said through gritted teeth, “D*mn it! You don’t care about martial virtue. A group of people bullies one person!”

“Grand Master Feng, this person is incomparably rude and unreasonable. He started a fight the moment he entered the entrance. He must be punished severely!” someone at the side said.

The old man called Grand Master Feng looked coldly at the burly man and said, “Your strength is not bad. You’re supposed to be a good seedling. Why’re you acting presumptuous at Thunder Courtyard?”

The burly man on the ground gritted his teeth and said, “You’re the unreasonable one! It’s not written on the door that I’m not allowed to enter, but you were so aggressive when I entered. Who has pampered you guys?”

Grand Master Feng’s face instantly darkened, and he berated, “Country bumpkin, you’re illiterate. Even if you’re highly talented, I won’t let you off today!”

With that, Grand Master Feng raised his palm, and a terrifying internal qi pressed down on the burly man!

The burly man struggled with all his might. The veins on his body were bulging, and at a glance, he looked like a yak. The red light on his body was even more mysterious!

“Ah!”

At this time, the burly man roared angrily and actually directly broke free of the terrifying internal qi that was pressing down on him!

Before Grand Master Feng could react, the burly man charged toward him with the blood-red light in his hand.

Grand Master Feng’s expression changed slightly. He snorted and raised his palm again.

A huge hand suddenly descended from the sky and pressed the burly man to the ground again.

The surrounding people were dumbfounded.

This Grand Master Feng was a famous figure in Thunder Courtyard. His strength was unfathomable, but this rough man in front of him had not only broken free from Grand Master Feng’s restraints but also dared to attack him!

“D*mn it!” Grand Master Feng coldly said.

He then raised his finger and pointed at the burly man with a terrifying internal qi.

This time, the burly failed to break free. He gritted his teeth and shouted, “Qin Yu, what kind of stupid place have you introduced me? You’ve really put me in trouble!”
