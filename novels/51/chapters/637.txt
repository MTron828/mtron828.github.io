Chapter 638: Rage! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Xia Hang had obtained the authority to mobilize the black-gold robe powerhouses. To him, this was almost an impossible thing.

Every black-gold robe powerhouses’ strength was above Xia Hang’s, so their status was naturally much higher than his, the empty position of vice president.

However, Xia Hang knew in his heart that if he could get rid of Qin Yu this time, he would definitely be credited with great merit, and he would be able to eliminate the potential danger.

...

Qin Yu sat in the courtyard the whole night without falling asleep.

He raised his head to look at the moon hanging high in the sky and couldn’t help but sigh slightly.

“What should I do...” Qin Yu couldn’t help but mutter in a low voice.

If he told the matter of the mask to the man with the mustache, with the man with the mustache’s experience, he would definitely be able to see the relationship between Xiao Yu and the masked woman.

If he hurt Xiao Yu, Qin Yu definitely wouldn’t be able to accept it.

But if he didn’t do that, how could he save Yan Ruoxue?

The man with the mustache looked trustworthy, but the premise was that the temptation of benefits wasn’t big enough. As long as the benefits reached a certain level, no one could guarantee what would happen.

He sat like this for the whole night.

In the early morning, Qin Yu stood up and gritted his teeth, “Xiao Yu, I will try my best to protect you!”

For Yan Ruoxue’s sake, Qin Yu had no other choice.

He turned around and went to the man with the mustache’s room, then knocked on the door.

After the door opened, the man with the mustache rubbed his eyes and said, “What are you doing? I haven’t woken up yet.”

Qin Yu said, “Didn’t you want to know the whereabouts of the mask? I can tell you.”

“Really?” The man with the mustache’s eyes lit up and he immediately became clear-headed.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “But you have to tell me how to activate these male corpses.”

The man with the mustache waved his hand and said, “I said that only I can use this spell. As long as you bring the mask, I will definitely be able to satisfy you.”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “Let me ask you, to activate this male corpses... does it require a certain amount of preparation?”

The man with the mustache was stunned and muttered, “How do you know?”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “Everything you do requires a large amount of preparation, and activating the male corpses isn’t an easy task, so naturally, you need to prepare.”

The man with the mustache muttered, “Indeed, and I need a certain amount of materials. I don’t have these materials at the moment.”

“Okay.” Qin Yu nodded.

“When you have gathered the materials and are ready, I will take you to see the mask,” said Qin Yu.

Hearing this, the man with the mustache immediately became anxious. He grabbed Qin Yu and said, “Don’t. Take me to see the mask first, even if it’s just a glance!”

“No.” Qin Yu’s tone wasn’t negotiable.

“If you have the time, you’d better hurry up and prepare the materials.”

The man with the mustache scratched his ears and cheeks anxiously, but he couldn’t do anything to Qin Yu.

“Okay, I’ll agree to it.” In the end, the man with the mustache could only compromise.

“But you can’t fool me. These materials require a lot of effort,” the man with the mustache reminded him.

“Don’t worry, I’m more anxious than you.” Qin Yu glanced at him and said.

At this point, Qin Yu asked, “How much time do you need?”

The man with the mustache thought for a moment and said, “At least a month, at most half a year. In short, I’ll do it as soon as possible.”

“It’ll take longer than I thought,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

However, this was the fastest way to challenge the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

If Qin Yu relied on himself, he would have to become a Martial Saint, or at least reach the peak of the Martial Marquis realm.

However, it was almost impossible for him to reach the Martial Saint realm within a short period of time.

“Then go and prepare as soon as possible. I’ll wait for you,” Qin Yu said.

The man with the mustache didn’t hesitate and set off on the same day to search for materials.

After he left, Qin Yu took out his phone and opened the Martial Arts Forum.

As expected, the forum was already in an uproar.

Although the Jingdu Martial Arts Association had tried all means to suppress the news, the impact of this matter was too great. It was already beyond the control of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

“Who is this black-robed man? He actually made the Jingdu Martial Arts Association suffer such a great loss!”

“In so many years, no one has ever dared to rob them.”

“Even Qin Yu couldn’t do such a thing.”

“Rumor has it that this person is Ancestor Guan! That old Martial Marquis!”

“Mm, rumor has it that Ancestor Guan is even older than Jiang He. If it is him, then it isn’t surprising.”

“He robbed the auction, killed three black-gold-robed men, and then left. How terrifying.”

For a moment, the words “black-robed man” became synonymous with mystery.

Naturally, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association suffered immense humiliation.

...

Jingdu, at a certain golf course.

Today, a few young masters from various aristocratic families seemed to be gathering here.

“Have you heard? That black-robed man killed two black-gold robe powerhouses. If it wasn’t for Yan Guiyi’s quick escape, I’m afraid he would have died under his blade,” Chu Heng said in a deep voice.

Xiao Yuan smiled slightly and said, “This news is probably known to everyone. It’s hard not to know.”

“Who exactly is this person? He actually has such heaven-defying strength. Could it really be Ancestor Guan?” Zhuang Teng said with a frown.

Yao Meng, who had been silent the whole time, shook her head and said, “I don’t think it’s Ancestor Guan. There’s no need for Ancestor Guan to do that.”

“If it’s not Ancestor Guan, who else could it be? It can’t be Jiang He, right?” Everyone laughed.

“Sigh, I heard that anyone who gets a bloodline from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association will become his prey. This makes us afraid to go.” Chu Heng sighed.

These people were all on the list. It was originally a good thing, but they didn’t dare to go unless the black-robed man died.

Even though they were the top young masters in Jingdu, they only had one life.

“Yeah, if we meet that black-robed man, we... probably won’t be able to escape,” Zhuang Teng also sighed.

“There’s always someone better than us. I was quite cocky originally,” someone said self-mockingly.

At this moment, Kong Yun snorted. “There’s no need to belittle yourself. Who knows how many years that black-robed man has lived. If he was as old as us, he definitely wouldn’t be a match for us.”

“That’s true. Brother Kong is right.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“That black-robed man has cultivated for who knows how many years”

Kong Yun’s words clearly received everyone’s approval.

...

Another day passed, and the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s operation officially began.

In the office, a total of eight black-gold robe powerhouses stood in front of Xia Hang.

These eight black-gold robe powerhouses were all in the middle stage of the Martial Marquis Realm.

Not only that, but they had also prepared several kinds of artifacts!

“Has the scene been prepared?” Xia Hang swept his gaze across the crowd and asked.

“we have set up an inescapable net. As long as he dares to appear, he will die without a doubt!” One of the black-gold robe powerhouses said.

Xia Hang took a deep breath, then stood up and said, “I will go ask President Qu for the Martial Saint weapon to kill him at the first opportunity!”
