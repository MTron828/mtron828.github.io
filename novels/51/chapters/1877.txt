1878 Terrifying Strength!

Nangong’s body trembled slightly, and a suit of armor appeared on his body.

The golden-glazed armor was extremely dazzling. With the long spear in his hand, he looked like a god of war.

“Why is he still holding a weapon for this competition?” Qin Yu frowned and asked.

“As long as it’s not a Saint Weapon, it’s not against the rules,” the peak master said with a bitter smile.

Qin Yu was even more surprised to hear this.

If that were the case, wouldn’t it be easy to deal with this guy if he took out the bracelets that Xiao Yu gave him?

Of course, Qin Yu was only thinking about it. He didn’t need to use any magical artifacts to deal with Nangong.

“Qin Yu, be careful!” Jiuxiao reminded him.

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. His body trembled slightly and landed in the center of the battlefield.

Their eyes met, and Nangong sneered non-stop.

“Tsk! Tsk! I was planning to humiliate Jiu Xiao, but I didn’t expect him to back off,” Nangong Yan sneered and said.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. Stepping the line word formula, he arrived in front of Nangong in an instant!

Nangong was stunned. Obviously, he didn’t expect Qin Yu to make a move suddenly!

When he came back to his senses, Qin Yu’s golden fist was already upon his face!

“D*mn it!”

Nangong’s expression changed drastically. He hurriedly activated a technique, and a brilliant light appeared on his face. The armor on his body also quickly wrapped around his face!

“Boom!”

The golden fist smashed into his face!

Nangong, who was showing off just now, was sent flying by a single punch!

The armor on his face was smashed into pieces by Qin Yu’s punch, and the radiance that gathered on his face was also shaken instantly!

Nangong’s body was dragged on the ground for a long time before he could stabilize himself.

At this moment, his face was already covered in blood. Half of his face was nearly smashed by a single punch!

“Qin Yu! You f*cking sneak attack!” Nangong cursed.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “From the moment we stood on this battlefield, the battle has begun. Who can you blame for talking too much nonsense? ”

“You!”

Nangong was furious instantly, but he couldn’t do anything to Qin Yu!

He subconsciously glanced at the dean and the others on the stage but realized they did not say anything.

“D*mn it!” Nangong was cursing in his heart while Qin Yu was feeling rather proud.

“No wonder Iron Egg never talks nonsense. It seems useful. Let me catch him off guard,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Nangong wiped away the blood from his face. He circulated Meridian Circulation Technique and slowly recovered his body.

What was even more shocking was that his armor was slowly recovering.

“You’ve missed the chance to defeat me. It’s your turn now!” Nangong shouted as he grabbed the spear and struck it 18 times in Qin Yu’s direction. Each strike was incredibly quick and powerful!

“It’s Nangong’s famous unique skill, the Eighteen Spears of Destiny,” Jiu Xiao said coldly.

“It’s his unique skill the moment he raised his hand. It seems that Nangong has been angered by Qin Yu’s actions,” the peak master could not help but smile bitterly.

The 18 spear strikes were like roaring golden dragons. They roared furiously and came at Qin Yu from different directions!

Qin Yu was not afraid at all. He was bathed in golden light. After a roar, the golden light on his body became even more dazzling. A terrifying aura spread out from his body and blocked all 18 spears in front of him! Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Immediately after, Qin Yu roared once again. His terrifying internal qi actually shattered the 18 spears directly!

“You do have some ability, but that’s all you have,” Nangong said coldly.

With that, he lifted the spear with one hand and flicked it forward. The entire ground suddenly rumbled, and the essence of the earth was triggered, turning into an incredibly powerful essence qi that overwhelmingly covered the heavens and earth!

It was formed by the essence of the earth and was unlimitedly powerful. Countless traces of essence qi formed a huge hand that seemed to be suppressing Qin Yu.

Nangong was indeed heaven’s favorite. A casual thrust of his spear could draw out such a terrifying essence of the earth!

Even the dean and the others on the stage were amazed by this move, and they were not stingy with their praise.

Qin Yu didn’t dodge. He knew well there was nowhere to hide. He raised his palm instantly to receive the essence of the earth.

“Boom!”

A terrifying explosion almost blasted through the incomparably stable space!

Qin Yu’s shoulders were shattered on the spot. Half of her body seemed to have collapsed!

Nangong certainly would not let go of this opportunity. He stabbed out the spears in his hand one after another. Every spear seemed to be able to draw upon the Great Dao of heaven and earth. It was unlimitedly powerful!

Although half of Qin Yu’s shoulders were broken, he was not afraid at all. Holding the Golden Light, he also activated the Great Dao of heaven and earth to fight.

In the blink of an eye, the two had exchanged hundreds of moves!

The void was full of the smashed flesh of the two. The Great Dao was constantly shattered, and the void collapsed piece by piece!

“As expected of a disciple of Thunder Courtyard. It’s really amazing,” some elders from the aristocratic families sighed and said.

Dean Lei was also staring at Qin Yu as if he wanted to see how capable he was.

“Hmph! The chaotic body is nothing more than this.” In the crowd, Si Shiyu sneered non-stop.

Qin Yu’s body emitted an infinite amount of light. The more he fought, the more courageous he became. His physical body was constantly regrowing as he faced Nangong’s spears.

...

Qin Yu didn’t use any magical artifacts because his physical body was an unparalleled divine weapon. It was not weaker than anything else!

“Go to hell!”

At this moment, Nangong’s angry roar spread out. His spear transformed endlessly and boundlessly, trying to destroy Qin Yu with one strike!

Qin Yu roared as well. Every bone in his body seemed to be glowing, and all the power was gathered in his hands.

At this moment, Qin Yu stretched out his hands and grabbed the spear!

“Ah!”

With a furious roar, the essence qi from his body burst out and fused onto his arms!

Even at a distance, the terrifying power could make people tremble with fear!

Even the dean and the others on the stage were tremendously shocked!

This power seemed to be able to pierce through the sky. It was extremely terrifying and made people at the scene feel incredibly horrified!

Qin Yu’s power was still rising. He didn’t use any technique, but only his destructive divine power!

...

“What a powerful strength!” Zhao Wan Er covered her mouth in shock.

Flower Granny was silent, but her eyes never left Qin Yu.

“Clang!”

At this moment, an earth-shattering sound rang out!

Nangong’s spear was broken by Qin Yu’s arms!

“How is that possible?” Nangong was shocked. He wanted to reform the spear with the help of a secret skill, but Qin Yu didn’t give him the chance!

At a glance, Qin Yu’s body was like a fireball, incredibly glaring!
