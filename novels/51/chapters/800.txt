Chapter 801: In the 800th chapter, he would fight little black again! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Luo Jingyu’s expression changed drastically. He subconsciously took two steps back and shouted, “Let’s attack together and kill him!”

Several marquises immediately activated their magic weapons and charged at Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s expression was cold and full of killing intent.

He clenched his golden light and suddenly threw a punch!

“Boom!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

With just this punch, the charging Marquis was sent flying!

The spiritual artifacts in their hands were directly shattered!

This scene immediately made the Luo father and son suck in a breath of cold air!

It had only been a few days, how did Qin Yu grow to such an extent? !

“Not good, retreat quickly!”Luo Jingyu sensed that something was wrong. He held the spiritual artifact in his hand and muttered in a low voice. Then, he dragged Luo Yang and turned around to run!

In the blink of an eye, the two people disappeared from Qin Yu’s sight.

Qin Yu could not help but frown and snorted, “They ran quite fast.”

They ran away, but these martial marquises of the pavilion of heavenly secrets could not run away.

Qin Yu did not show any mercy. He immediately went on a killing spree, one punch after another.

In the blink of an eye, several martial marquises fell to the ground!

Qin Yu dug out their golden cores and took away their magic weapons.

Apart from that, Qin Yu turned around and returned to the hall. He looted all the magic weapons placed in the hall of the villa, leaving nothing behind!

After doing all this, Qin Yu left the pavilion of heavenly secrets.

All the magic weapons of the pavilion of heavenly secrets had been looted!

If this news were to spread, it would definitely shock the entire world!

In the afternoon, Luo Jingyu brought Luo Yang back to the pavilion of Heavenly Secrets.

Looking at the empty cabinets in the hall, Luo Jingyu’s heart felt like it was cut by a knife.

“Qin Yu... This Qin Yu... Pfft!”

In his fury, Luo Jingyu spat out a mouthful of blood, and his face turned a few times paler.

“Dad!”Luo Yang hurriedly held Luo Jingyu.

Luo Jingyu glared at Luo Yang and said through gritted teeth, “It’s all your fault, it’s all your fault, it’s all your fault!”

Luo Yang opened his mouth but didn’t dare to say another word.

“Qin Yu... I want you to die, I definitely want you to die! !”

Luo Jingyu’s angry roar reverberated in the hall for a long time.

...

At this moment, Qin Yu was sitting in the mansion, admiring these top-tier spiritual artifacts with his handlebar mustache.

“TSK tsk, I’m rich, I’m Rich.”The handlebar mustache licked his lips and said.

Qin Yu smiled faintly and said, “Not bad, this trip was not a waste.”

These magic artifacts were all top-notch items. Qin Yu planned to distribute them to disciples of the heaven’s gate or disciples of the Green Moon Villa.

When they attacked the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, they would definitely be of great use!

At this moment, someone suddenly walked in from outside.

At a glance, it was Granny Qin, and beside her was Blackie!

At this moment, Little Black had already returned to his human form. The coldness on his face was not concealed at all.

Qin Yu slowly stood up and sneered, “You’ve returned to your human form so quickly. Your efficiency is quite high.”

Little black said coldly, “Qin Yu, I’ll See You Tomorrow at Green Hill Mountain.”

“Sure.”Qin Yu sneered again and again.

At this moment, Qin Yu was even more anxious than little black.

Taking advantage of the fact that the martial saint’s power was still there, Qin Yu had to enter the second secret realm as soon as possible and take Yan Ruoxue away!

“Qin Yu, I hope you keep your word.”Granny Qin said coldly with her hands behind her back.

Qin Yu laughed coldly and said, “Don’t worry, Old Bastard.”

Granny Qin snorted lightly. She did not say anything and turned around to leave with little black.

“The martial saint’s power on Little Black’s body is still there.”The Mustache Man said with a frown.

“That’s normal. After all, it’s the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s method. I’m afraid it’s much more advanced than the Xue family’s.”Qin Yu said.

The mustached man laughed, “Then can you defeat him?”

“With a raise of my hand.”Qin Yu said lightly.

This was the powerful confidence brought about by the martial saint’s power!

At night.

Suddenly, snowflakes floated in the sky.

Qin Yu stood in the courtyard of this mansion, allowing the heavy snow to fall on his body.

Old Mister Yan had said that on the day Yan Ruoxue was born, heavy snow fell from the sky, hence the name.

Qin Yu had also looked forward to walking in the snow with Yan Ruoxue.

All of this seemed to be within reach.

“Ruoxue, wait for me. Tomorrow, Tomorrow I will take you away!”Qin Yu clenched his fists.

Time flew by.

The next morning, little black arrived at Qinggang Mountain early.

The Qinggang Mountain had already turned into ruins, and it looked like it was in decline.

The young masters of the various major worlds in Jingdu had also arrived.

“TSK TSK, this battle is ultimately unavoidable,”zhuang teng sighed.

“Little Black has the power of a martial saint. It will be very difficult for Qin Yu to win unless he summons the two monsters from last time,”Chu Heng said.

Everyone could not help but shudder at the mention of the two guardians from last time.

“Tsk Tsk, I’m afraid it won’t be that simple. If Qin Yu can easily summon those two monsters, then what does the Jingdu Martial Arts Association count for?”Kong Yun could not help but snort coldly.

“That’s right. I’ve checked the information these few days. Those two monsters are completely out of control.”At this moment, Yan Jinyao opened his mouth to speak.

He crossed his arms over his chest and said coldly, “But it’s hard to say who will win today. I do hope that Qin Yu will win.”

“Oh?”A trace of surprise flashed across Zhuang Teng’s face.

Yan Jinyao snorted coldly and said, “It’s time to end things between me and Qin Yu.”

“If Qin Yu is lucky enough to survive today, I will issue a challenge to Qin Yu.”

When he said this, everyone could not help but be slightly surprised.

“Haha, the fight between Brother Yan and Qin Yu will definitely be spectacular!”Someone echoed.

Yan Jinyao didn’t say a word. He closed his eyes slightly and didn’t say anything more.

“HMM? It seems that someone came from the Military District?”At this moment, a car from the military district suddenly drove over.

The car stopped, and a tall man with sword-like eyebrows and starry eyes walked out.

He was wearing a military green coat, and his eyes were extremely deep. His imposing manner was hard to ignore.

“It’s Ye Qing! Officer Ye is here too,”Zhuang Teng said with a frown.

“Ye Qing? Is He going to intervene?”

“The military district represents the government. Even the Jingdu Martial Arts Association doesn’t dare to act Rashly.”

Ye Qing’s arrival had undoubtedly pushed this great battle to its climax.

A trace of displeasure flashed across Granny Qin’s face as she strode towards ye Qing.

“Officer Ye, why are you here?”Granny Qin asked tentatively with her hands behind her back.

Ye Qing glanced at her and said, “Why, can’t I Come?”

Granny Qin snorted lightly and said, “Of course not. I just hope that officer ye doesn’t interfere in this matter.”

Ye Qing laughed and said, “Don’t worry. I’m only here to watch the battle. I Won’t interfere at all.”

Speaking up to this point, officer ye paused for a moment. He looked coldly at Granny Qin and said, “Also, you’d better pay attention to the tone you speak to me. Otherwise, I can’t guarantee what will happen.”
