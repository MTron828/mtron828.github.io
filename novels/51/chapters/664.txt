Xia Hang’s hope suddenly rose!

Downstairs, Geng Si also sensed this strange internal qi.

He released Qin Yu and turned around to look behind him.

He saw an old man standing quietly at the end of the street.

Although his body was hunched, his internal qi was extremely strong!

The rain fell on his body, making him look like an ordinary old man on a farm.

Geng Si narrowed his eyes slightly. He turned to look at the old man and said coldly, “Jiang He?”

It was Jiang He! He looked at Geng Si quietly and walked forward step by step!

Jiang He’s sudden appearance made Geng Si’s expression look a little ugly.

Soon, Jiang He walked to Geng Si.

Their eyes met, and the atmosphere was very tense.

Compared to Geng Si’s tall and straight figure, Jiang He seemed to be a little short.

But the internal qi on his body was not inferior to Geng Si’s at all!

“Jiang He, what are you doing here?” Geng Si narrowed his eyes and said.

Jiang He pointed at Qin Yu on the ground and said, “I’m here for him.”

Geng Si sneered and said, “Jiang He, didn’t you already go into seclusion and ignore the affairs of the world? Why, are you going back on your words now?”

Jiang He slowly waved his hand and said, “This has nothing to do with you.”

Geng Si laughed and said, “Jiang He! Back then, you made an enemy of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association and threatened to change the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. Did you do it?”

“You should know that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association cannot be shaken by a single person. Today, do you still want to be stubborn?”

Faced with Geng Si’s questioning, Jiang He appeared unusually calm.

He lowered his head and glanced at Qin Yu, then said with a smile, “What I didn’t do back then, he might be able to do. I have hope in him.”

“Hope?” Geng Si narrowed his eyes and then sneered. “I knew you wouldn’t give up! I should have let the Jingdu Martial Arts Association kill you back then!”

Jiang He waved his hand as if he didn’t want to talk about the past.

He just pointed at Qin Yu on the ground and said, “He can definitely do it.”

“Can he do it? Hehe, you want to take him away?” Geng Si narrowed his eyes and asked.

Jiang He shook his head and said, “No, in order to complete his plan, you have to die.”

You have to die!

Although it was only a few words, it made people’s hair stand on end!

Geng Si took two steps back and said coldly, “Jiang He, you should know the price of attacking a purple robe! Do you want to give up your current stable life?”

Jiang He couldn’t help but sigh slightly and said, “The failure back then made me unable to recover. I lived in seclusion for many years. I thought I would live on with my last breath... Until I saw Qin Yu.”

“When I saw him, I thought of me in the past. This made me, who chose to live in seclusion, feel ashamed,” Jiang He sighed.

“I may not be able to go against the Jingdu Martial Arts Association now, but I think I can still pave the way for him.”

Geng Si’s expression immediately became extremely ugly! He stared at Jiang He and said, “Jiang He, do you know what you are doing?! If you attack me today, you will definitely regret it!”

Jiang He looked at the root pose and slowly said, “If I don’t attack, I will regret it even more.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the internal qi on Jiang He’s body suddenly changed drastically!

His originally kind face instantly became murderous! In just a short moment, he seemed to have changed into a different person!

That powerful internal qi made even Geng Si’s heart skip a beat!

Geng Si glared at Jiang He and said, “Jiang He! Do you think I am afraid of you? It is not certain who will win!”

As he spoke, Geng Si’s hands once again condensed the destroy spell!

A monstrous power instantly blotted out the sky and covered the earth!

Facing Geng Si’s destroy spell, Jiang He also slowly raised his hand.

On his hand, a word condensed!

Its terrifying power far surpassed the destroy spell!

“Go to hell!” Geng Si shouted! The destroy spell in his hand was immediately slapped out!

Jiang He also gently pushed his palm forward. The two big words collided in an instant, stirring up waves of terrifying wind!

The moment the destroy spell touched, it quickly began to dissipate.

Not only did it only take ten seconds, but the destroy spell disappeared without a trace.

The fighting formula hit Geng Si’s body hard, causing Geng Si to stagger back and spit out blood!

“The so-called destroy spell is just a pirated version. In front of the nine secrets, it is nothing,” Jiang He said lightly with his hands behind his back.

Geng Si’s expression was extremely ugly. Of course, he knew what kind of spell Jiang He was using!

This was the nine secrets of Taoism. It was mysterious and unpredictable!

Although what Jiang He was using was only superficial, it was definitely more powerful than the “eighteen characters” formula!

“Jiang He, it’s still not too late for you to stop now!” Geng Si said angrily.

Jiang He shook his head. “As long as you attack, there is no way out. You should know this better than me.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Geng Si thought to himself that things were not looking good. Since Jiang He was called number one, his strength naturally couldn’t be underestimated!

“Now that things have come to this, I can only escape!” Geng Si roared crazily!

Thinking of this, Geng Si directly used the wind spell, and his speed instantly reached the limit!

As long as he escaped from here, he could inform the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!

Facing Geng Si, who was escaping, Jiang He was not anxious at all. He muttered in a low voice, and once again used the nine secrets!

This time, it was the “Xing” character of the nine secrets!

Its speed far exceeded the wind spell. With just one step, it blocked Geng Si’s path!

“I told you, your eighteen character formula is only a copy. It’s not worth mentioning,” Jiang He said quietly with his hands behind his back.

Geng Si roared angrily, “Jiang He! Are you really going to do this?!”

Jiang He smiled and said, “Is it meaningful to repeat a sentence so many times?”

As he spoke, internal qi had already gathered on Jiang He’s old palms.

This internal qi seemed to be vague, but its power made people’s hair stand on end!

“Ah!!!”

Geng Si immediately raised his head and roared. All of the internal qi gathered on his hands, as if he wanted to put up a stubborn resistance!

However, Jiang He’s strength was too strong. He raised his palm and smashed all of the internal qi gathered by Geng Si with one palm!

Such strength made Geng Si panic!

“Jiang He, I can let you take Qin Yu away. I can also pretend that nothing happened today!” Cold sweat dripped down Geng Si’s forehead, and he was extremely flustered.

Jiang He shook his head. “Only the dead are the safest.”

Geng Si wanted to say something, but Jiang He didn’t give him a chance.

His skinny palm grabbed at Geng Si’s head!

Then, Jiang He exerted force, and Geng Si’s head was crushed!
