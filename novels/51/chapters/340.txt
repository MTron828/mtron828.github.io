Chapter 341: Spend More Time With Your Girlfriend Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The Spirit Fire seemed to have lost control, and Luo Cheng was in extreme pain.

His fist arrived in front of Qin Yu almost in an instant!

Even Qin Yu didn’t dare to underestimate a body that was wrapped in the Spirit Fire.

He hurriedly circulated his spiritual power and met it head-on.

“Clang!” A loud sound rang out! Qin Yu’s fist was instantly injured by the Spirit Fire! Black cracks appeared one after another!

Qin Yu took two steps back and said with a frown, “As expected of the Spirit Fire. Its power is extraordinary.”

Luo Cheng’s body was still rushing towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu could clearly feel that Luo Cheng’s consciousness was fading.

“Kill him.” At this moment, the Pavilion Master who had been sitting in front suddenly waved her hand.

Upon hearing this order, the eight Law Enforcement Elders of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion immediately stepped forward!

A terrifying pressure instantly spread out!

Just as they were about to make their move, Qin Yu suddenly shouted, “Wait!”

The Law Enforcement Elders immediately stopped in midair. They subconsciously looked at the Pavilion Master, as if they were waiting for her order.

The Pavilion Master nodded, as if she also wanted to see what tricks Qin Yu was up to.

Luo Cheng, who was wrapped in flames, was still charging towards him in a frenzy.

And this time, Qin Yu didn’t choose to take it head-on. Instead, he relied on his nimble body to dodge repeatedly.

Qin Yu dodged, but this pavilion was destroyed beyond recognition.

Just as everyone was worried, Qin Yu suddenly shouted!

Following that, Qin Yu’s body was enveloped by a blue light!

This light rapidly turned into flames!

The intensity of the flames even surpassed Luo Cheng’s!

The two flames collided in an instant!

Sizzling sounds were incessant!

Everyone was flabbergasted and dumbstruck. They didn’t understand what Qin Yu was trying to do.

Even the Pavilion Master, who had been expressionless the entire time, had a flash of surprise on her face!

“Swoosh!”

Luo Cheng charged towards Qin Yu once again!

This time, Qin Yu didn’t dodge. Instead, he roared repeatedly!

The veins on his forehead bulged, and boundless spiritual energy flowed through his dantian into his entire body!

In the next second, the flames on Qin Yu’s body expanded explosively once again!

The Blue Spirit Fire actually spread out in all directions!

When everyone saw this, they hurriedly ran to the side!

Even the Law Enforcement Elder couldn’t help but feel a little nervous.

After all, Spirit Fire was the purest fire in the world, and its power was beyond imagination!

Beads of sweat were left on Qin Yu’s forehead, and a golden glow was flickering between his brows.

It was obvious that the move Qin Yu used was extremely strenuous.

“Ah!!”

Finally! Following Qin Yu’s furious roar, the spiritual flames that spread out in all directions actually condensed once again!

The spiritual flames seemed to be controlled by Qin Yu as they swept out with Luo Cheng as the center!

In a short instant, Qin Yu’s enormous spiritual flames wrapped around Luo Cheng!

“Ah!!”

Waves of anguished wails sounded from Luo Cheng’s mouth!

His physical body seemed to have been deprived of its soul!

On the other hand, the cold sweat on Qin Yu’s face became denser and denser, and his teeth seemed to be on the verge of being crushed from being clenched so tightly!

“Ah!”

With another explosive roar, Qin Yu seemed to have gone mad!

The spirit energy in his body became extremely violent and surged out crazily!

And the Spirit Fire expanded explosively once again!

“Hu...”

After an unknown amount of time, the intense power began to slowly disappear.

And the Spirit Fire on Luo Cheng’s body was actually forcefully stripped out by the Spirit Fire emitted by Qin Yu!

Luo Cheng fell to the ground with a plop.

And the flame that lingered in the air slowly returned to Qin Yu’s body!

Their surroundings became quiet. No one knew what had happened. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Qin Yu wiped the sweat from his forehead and muttered softly, “As expected.”

On the stage, the Pavilion Master’s eyes shone with a bright light!

A rare smile appeared on her face.

“Qin Yu, you are really a genius.” The Pavilion Master said indifferently.

Hearing the Pavilion Master’s praise, Qin Yu appeared a little embarrassed. The people around couldn’t understand the meaning of their conversation.

“Luo Cheng’s flame was forcefully turned into yours?” The Pavilion Master said with a nonchalant smile.

Qin Yu scratched his head and said, “Just now, Luo Cheng said that his flame was given by the Han family. I was thinking that since it could be given, then it could be swallowed too.”

“So you used an even larger Spirit Fire to forcibly seize Luo Cheng’s Spirit Fire?” The Pavilion Master praised.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, I was only guessing whether it would succeed or not. Actually, I wasn’t sure either. Fortunately, the result was good.”

“Controlling the Spirit Fire requires an extremely strong ability. The slightest carelessness could result in a backlash. Weren’t you afraid?” The Pavilion Master said.

“Of course I was afraid.” Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

“But I was born without a powerful background, and I don’t have much time. If I don’t take the risk, I’m afraid I’ll never get the chance.” Qin Yu sighed and said.

The Pavilion Master’s eyes were filled with admiration for Qin Yu.

She slowly stood up and said indifferently, “From today onwards, you are the Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s Third Elder.”

Once these words were said, the entire crowd went into an uproar!

They originally thought that Qin Yu would take the back seat, but they didn’t expect him to replace the Third Elder!

The Pavilion Master didn’t stay any longer. She took light steps and disappeared into the pavilion in the blink of an eye.

The people around gulped.

After listening to the Pavilion Master’s explanation, they were immediately filled with admiration for Qin Yu.

Even Taozi, who had always been incomparably arrogant, gave Qin Yu a thumbs up!

“Qin Yu, this is the first time the Pavilion Master has praised someone!” The Fifth Elder walked forward and couldn’t help but sigh.

“Yes, Mr. Qin, Oh No, Elder Qin, your technique really shocked us!”

Qin Yu waved his hand and said modestly, “I was just lucky.”

“It’s not good to be too modest.” The Fifth Elder rolled his eyes.

After a round of flattery, everyone finally dispersed.

Qin Yu followed behind the First Elder and the Fifth Elder to get the token.

After Qin Yu got the token, the Fifth Elder couldn’t help but say, “I didn’t expect you to rank above me. You will be my superior in the future.”

Qin Yu hurriedly cupped his hands and said, “Fifth Elder, you must be joking. You will always be my Elder.”

“Hahaha!” The Fifth Elder patted Qin Yu’s shoulder with a gratified smile on his face.

“What are your next plans?” Fifth Elder asked casually.

Qin Yu pondered for a moment and said, “I want to apply for herbs and go into seclusion as soon as possible.”

Fifth Elder nodded and said, “This is a good choice, but you have to apply for it from the Pavilion Master.”

“I understand. I’ll go now.” Qin Yu turned around and was about to leave.

“Why are you in such a hurry?” The Fifth Elder said in surprise.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I don’t have much time. Every second counts.”
