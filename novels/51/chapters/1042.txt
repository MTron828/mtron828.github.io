Chapter 1043: Chapter One Thousand and forty-three was an extraordinary method at an extraordinary time 

When faced with these two martial saints who had suddenly attacked, Zhai Xing’s expression was gloomy and uncertain.

However, as a peak martial saint, he was not overly afraid.

“Hand over the thing obediently so that you won’t suffer a physical pain.”Those two people said with a cold smile.

Zhai xing shouted loudly, “I’ve lived for so long, yet I’ve never known what it means to hand over the thing! If you have any ability, just use it!”

When the two people saw this, they did not say anything more. They immediately held the secret technique in their hands and charged towards Zhai Xing.

Zhai Xing’s strength was extremely powerful, but unfortunately, he was too heavily injured and could not display even one-tenth of his current strength.

Faced with the two martial saints’all-out attacks, Zhai Xing quickly fell into a disadvantageous position.

The injuries on his body continued and he was continuously forced to retreat.

After more than ten rounds, Zhai Xing fell to the ground and could not get up anymore!

The two sneered. One of them raised his foot and stepped on Zhai Xing’s chest. He said coldly, “I didn’t expect that one day, we would be able to teach the famous Zhai Xing a lesson.”

Zhai Xing gritted his teeth. He wanted to get up, but he could not.

“It’s better to hand the thing over obediently!”

They captured Zhai Xing and forcefully took the spatial artifact!

“Give it back to me!”Zhai Xing was instantly enraged!

“Give it back to you? Zhai Xing, if we don’t kill you, you’ll be burning incense.”The two sneered.

“Should we take this opportunity to get rid of him?”One of them suggested.

“There’s no need. If we kill him, it’ll easily cause unnecessary trouble.”The other said.

Then, the two didn’t say anything more.

They dispelled the spatial spell and turned around to leave.

Zhai Xing lay on the ground. He was full of anger, but there was nothing he could do. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

He didn’t know how long he lay there before he had the strength to get up.

He sighed slightly and didn’t know how to explain himself.

But the Loyal Zhai Xing still rushed to the second secret realm without hesitation.

...

Heaven Gate, in a secret room.

Qin Yu sat cross-legged here and slightly absorbed the power of creation in front of him.

Although he had already stepped into the martial saint realm, the pressure on his body did not decrease.

That Almighty from the secret territory of the Yan family had said that if he wanted to see Yan Ruoxue, he had to at least step into the Almighty Realm.

This world was too vast. Besides this planet, there was an even wider world.

At this moment, there was a sound from outside. It was as if someone was knocking on the door.

Qin Yu opened his eyes slightly. Then, with a wave of his hand, the door slowly opened.

Two unfamiliar faces walked into the secret room.

They half-knelt in front of Qin Yu, cupped their hands and said, “Sect master!”

Qin Yu stood up and said indifferently, “How is the matter?”

“Everything went smoothly.”The two took out a spatial artifact.

And this spatial artifact was the one Zhai Xing had!

Qin Yu took the spatial artifact and said in a low voice, “It wasn’t exposed, right?”

“Don’t worry, he definitely doesn’t know that we were sent by you.”The two laughed.

“It’s just that the Hong Yi sect is going to take the blame for us.”

Qin Yu snorted lightly, “The Hong Yi sect has used me so many times. Letting them take the blame once is nothing.”

No one would have thought that these two people were actually sent by Qin Yu

The one who snatched the soul bell was not the Hong Yi sect at all, but Qin Yu’s people!

“Sect leader, why are you doing this? Wouldn’t it be more direct if you directly detained Zhai Xing?”The two people voiced out the doubts in their hearts.

Qin Yu glanced at them and shook his head. “If that’s the case, Zhai Xing will never serve me.”

Special Times required some special methods.

Qin Yu had no choice.

He did not have much time to waste on the second mystic realm, so he could only use this method to shorten the time.

Moreover... Even if Zhai Xing would not betray him, he would at least take away the soul bell and avoid large-scale casualties.

Qin Yu couldn’t open this spatial artifact, so he didn’t study it too much and put it away.

“Zhai Xing, I can only do this,”Qin Yu whispered.

...

On the other side.

Zhai Xing returned to the second secret realm.

He knelt in front of Gu Zizhen, his face filled with guilt.

Looking at Zhai Xing in front of him, Gu Zizhen’s face was cold.

“Why did you fail again?”There was a hint of anger in Gu Zizhen’s voice.

“I’m no match for him,”Zhai Xing answered truthfully.

“No match for him?”Gu Zizhen could not help but grit his teeth. Then, he said furiously, “You’re spouting nonsense! He’s only at the early-stage of the martial saint realm. How could he be a match for You?”

Zhai Xing said in a deep voice, “I’m really no match for him. I’ve already said that Qin Yu is not an ordinary martial saint.”

“Haha!”Gu Zizhen was so angry that he laughed instead.

“According to what you said, if he were to step into the intermediate stage of the martial saint, even I would not be a match for him? If he were to step into the advanced stage of the Martial Saint, would he be able to surpass his level and kill a mighty figure?”Gu Zizhen said angrily.

Zhai Xing raised his head and looked at Gu Zizhen. He shook his head and said, “To be precise, you might not be a match for him now. If he were to step into the intermediate stage of the martial saint, perhaps he would have the ability to stand firm.”

“Bullsh * T!”Gu Zizhen flipped the table in front of him.

He pointed at Zhai Xing and said, “Why do you want to make others proud and destroy your own prestige?”

“I’m just being honest with Uncle Chen.”Zhai Xing’s expression did not change.

Gu Zizhen pointed at Zhai Xing and said, “Even if what you said is true, what about the soul clock? You can use the soul clock to kill him a hundred times!”

“I... There are too few people around me. The strength of the soul bell is too weak,”Zhai Xing stammered.

Gu Zizhen sneered and said, “Zhai Xing, you are still as bad as ever at lying. Why are you blushing?”

Zhai Xing kept silent and only lowered his head.

“Forget it. I don’t want to talk nonsense with you anymore. Where is the Soul Bell?”Gu Zizhen said with a gloomy face.

Zhai Xing’s face slightly changed, and he said in a low voice, “The soul clock... has been robbed.”
