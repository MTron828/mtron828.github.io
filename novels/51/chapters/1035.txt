Chapter 1036: Chapter 1,036, the battle against Star Seizer!

Qin Yu’s heart was extremely complicated when it came to star seizer.

He was not a simple bad person like Gu Xinghe. There was still a trace of conscience in his heart.

“Hu...”Qin Yu took a deep breath and lay down on the chair.

He would take things one step at a time. Since he had taken the initiative to come to his door, he could only accept the challenge.

That afternoon.

Jiang he and Xu Huaigu rushed to the Heaven Gate.

Naturally, they had heard of the news that Zhai Xing was coming.

The purpose of coming to the Heaven Gate this time was also very clear. He was here to assist Qin Yu.

In the room, three people sat at a table.

“Zhai Xing is very powerful. He had already stepped into the advanced stage of the Martial Saint Realm many years ago. Even in that era, he was still an outstanding person,”Jiang he said.

Xu Huaigu nodded slightly and said, “Speaking of which, Zhai Xing is our senior. Before the appearance of the mystic realm, he was indeed a rare powerhouse.”

Qin Yu remained silent. Of course, he knew Zhai Xing’s strength.

“When the time comes, I will fight with you against Zhai Xing,”Jiang he said.

“That’s not necessary.”Qin Yu shook his head.

“Senior Jiang he, I am not afraid of Zhai Xing. It’s just that... I don’t want to kill him.”

These words couldn’t help but make Jiang he and Xu Huaigu look at each other.

Don’t want to kill Zhai Xing? These words were really arrogant.

“If the two seniors want to help me, why don’t you come with me to conquer the second secret realm?”Qin Yu suggested.

He looked at Jiang he, his eyes filled with anticipation.

Qin Yu had also heard of Jiang he’s story.

Back then, he was also a person who resisted the martial arts association in Jingdu, but later on, he declined.

Qin Yu believed that there was still a ball of fire in his heart, a ball of fire that resisted.

“Let’s take care of the matter at hand first.”Jiang he slowly shook his head.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly.

It seemed that star seizer was indeed powerful enough in their hearts.

Even Jiang he, who thought that Qin Yu would be invincible, had no confidence now.

Qin Yu was not in a hurry.

The four gates of heaven were wide open. Qin Yu was in the sect, quietly waiting for the arrival of Zhai Xing.

Before Zhai Xing arrived, there were already many martial artists lurking around the Heaven Gate.

No one wanted to miss such a unique battle.

In the following days, Qin Yu swept the ground and drank tea in the yard every day. When he had nothing to do, he would play with the birds and Hum a little tune, as if he had retired early.

Qin Yu’s leisurely attitude naturally caused a heated discussion.

He originally thought that Qin Yu should be sitting in full swing, preparing and deploying before the battle. Who would have thought that Qin Yu would actually be so relaxed.

Another two days passed.

At the entrance of the Heaven Gate, a figure appeared.

This person was tall and had a resolute expression.

Standing there, he was like a lofty and immovable mountain.

This person was none other than the famous Zhai Xing!

The people hiding in the dark had chosen their positions one after another, afraid that they would miss this great battle.

“Zhai Xing is Here! It’s even faster than I thought!”

“This great battle has finally arrived.”

“I don’t know who is stronger, the top martial saints of the older generation or the peerless geniuses of the new generation.”

There were even people who opened the betting forum and placed bets.

Zhai Xing stood at the entrance. No one dared to approach him.

He was not in a hurry to enter either. He just stood there and waited quietly.

“Sect leader, it’s bad. Zhai Xing is Here!”

A disciple ran in hurriedly. His face was filled with panic.

Qin Yu put down the broom in his hand and muttered in a low voice, “What should come will come...”

After saying that, his eyes looked in the direction of the mountain gate, and a bright light shot out!

Zhai Xing, who was standing at the door, also looked at Qin Yu at the same time!

Even though the two of them were far apart, at this moment, their gazes were colliding!

Qin Yu seemed to have shifted his position and arrived in front of Zhai Xing in the blink of an eye.

The two of them were less than five meters apart, one tall and one short, one old and one young, forming a sharp contrast.

Their eyes met, and the two of them did not speak for a long time.

“Zhai Xing, you’re finally here.”Finally, Qin Yu was the first to speak.

Zhai Xing said coldly, “What else? You should know in your heart that there will definitely be a battle between you and me.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Zhai Xing, as a senior, who is wrong and who is right? Don’t you know in Your Heart?”

“That has nothing to do with me!”

Zhai Xing appeared extremely excited when this topic was brought up.

He said coldly, “I only know that I work for the second Mystic Realm.”

Qin Yu sighed and said, “Zhai Xing, you should know that the current you is not my match.”

When these words were said, everyone was shocked! Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Although they were far away, these words had entered everyone’s ears!

They turned pale with fright, unable to lower their tongues!

Qin Yu was actually so confident and arrogant?

Facing the top experts of the older generation, he actually dared to say such words?

“That’s right.”

Under everyone’s gazes, Zhai Xing nodded and admitted Qin Yu’s arrogant words!

This instantly caused everyone’s eyes to widen!

They seemed to not dare to believe their ears!

Zhai Xing actually admitted that he was inferior to Qin Yu? How was this possible?

“I don’t want to kill you,”Qin Yu said slowly with his hands behind his back.

Zhai Xing narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “Your strength is indeed far superior to ordinary warriors, but the great battle changes in an instant. No one knows the outcome until the end.”

Qin Yu’s frown became tighter and tighter.

He raised his head to look at Zhai Xing and said, “Why do you have to work for the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?”

“Cut the crap. I don’t want to destroy your sect,”Zhai Xing coldly said.

Qin Yu’s expression also gradually turned cold.

“In that case, I can only respectfully comply.”Qin Yu’s body emitted a rare chill.
