Hearing Elder Qu’s words, everyone fell silent.

Gu Canghai, on the other hand, was full of anger. He stared coldly at Elder Qu and said, “We, the dignified Saint Confucian Sect, will take the initiative to negotiate peace? If this gets out, won’t the Saint Confucian Sect’s prestige be destroyed?”

Elder Qu hurriedly explained, “The entire Saint Confucian Sect is in panic right now, especially those families!”

“They thought that the Saint Confucian Sect would be able to protect them, but in the end, it brought disaster. If this goes on, the Saint Confucian Sect’s reputation will suffer even more!”

Gu Canghai frowned when he heard this.

Elder Qu’s words weren’t without reason. If this continued, no one would dare to get involved with the Saint Confucian Sect in the future.

Gu Canghai was silent for a moment, then he said, “How are you sure that Qin Yu will agree?”

Elder Qu said, “I’m not sure either, so... I can only give it a try.”

Gu Canghai didn’t speak, as if he was considering the pros and cons.

A moment later, Gu Canghai looked at Elder Qu.

He said in a deep voice, “Alright, we will do as you say, but... We must try our best to keep it a secret and not let word of it get out.”

Elder Qu nodded and said, “I understand!”

Elder Qu immediately sent someone to contact Qin Yu.

It wasn’t difficult to contact Qin Yu. They sent someone to deliver the news to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

After the Second Elder learned of this matter, he couldn’t help but feel stunned.

“Is the Divine Alchemist Pavilion admitting defeat?” The Fifth Elder also swallowed hard.

The Second Elder said in a deep voice, “There must be a trick. Qin Yu has killed so many people from the Saint Confucian Sect. How can the Saint Confucian Sect let it go just like that?!”

“I think it’s better to let Qin Yu make his own decision,” said the Fifth Elder.

Then, the Fifth Elder took out his phone and dialed Qin Yu’s number.

He told Qin Yu the intentions of the Saint Confucian Sect.

“Qin Yu, you must be careful. I suspect that there’s a trap,” said the Fifth Elder in a deep voice.

On the other end, Qin Yu said indifferently, “It’s okay. I know what to do.”

After saying that, Qin Yu directly hung up the phone.

At this moment, Qin Yu was sitting in a restaurant and eating noodles.

He put down the chopsticks in his hand and couldn’t help but sneer.

“The chance is finally here.” Qin Yu sneered again and again.

Everything he did was to have a chance to talk to the Saint Confucian Sect!

If Qin Yu took the initiative to suggest it, the high and mighty Saint Confucian Sect would never give Qin Yu a chance to speak. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

For sects and aristocratic families like this, only when they were forced into a desperate situation would they compromise.

After thinking about it for a long time, Qin Yu finally decided to seek help from the media.

But ordinary media outlets definitely wouldn’t dare to offend the Saint Confucian Sect. Hence, Qin Yu had to find a media outlet that was powerful and influential enough to interview them.

Pyro was very big. Although the Saint Confucian Sect was powerful, they weren’t invincible.

There were always people more powerful, and there were many who weren’t afraid of the Saint Confucian Sect.

Qin Yu’s first choice was Sea City.

Sea City was one of the largest cities in the country, and the powerful people there rivaled Jingdu’s.

There were also many great aristocratic families and clans among them!

“Looks like I have to make a trip to Sea City.” Qin Yu thought to himself.

The largest aristocratic family in Sea City was the Teng family.

Not only did the Teng family have hundreds of millions of family assets, but they were also extremely well-connected.

However, compared to the aristocratic families in Jingdu, the Teng family’s martial power was relatively weak.

It was said that the strongest person in the huge Teng family was only a half-step Martial Marquis.

After thinking about it, Qin Yu finally turned to Old Mister Yan for help.

Fortunately, Old Mister Yan and the Teng family were friends.

“The Teng family received my favor back then. If I reveal my identity, he should give in,” said Old Mister Yan on the other end.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment and said, “Okay, I’ll wait for your news.”

Half an hour later, Old Mister Yan called back.

He said on the phone, “Everything went well. Tonight, at eight o’clock, The Teng family will be waiting for you at home.”

“Okay, thank you,” Qin Yu agreed.

At night, Qin Yu came to The Teng family’s residence.

In The Teng family’s huge villa, only a few housekeepers were cleaning.

Qin Yu sat there quietly while waiting for the Teng family to arrive.

About ten minutes later, a middle-aged man in a nightgown walked down from upstairs.

This middle-aged man was none other than the Teng family’s patriarch, Teng Gong!

As soon as Teng Gong appeared, all the housekeepers called out, “Master.”

Teng Gong nodded slightly and walked directly to Qin Yu. He looked Qin Yu up and down and said, “You’re Qin Yu?”

“Greetings, Mr. Teng.” Qin Yu nodded.

Teng Gong said with a nonchalant smile, “You have been in the limelight recently. Your legend has spread to Sea City.”

Qin Yu said with a smile, “You flatter me, Mr. Teng.”

“Tell me, what’s the matter?” Teng Gong said indifferently.

Qin Yu immediately expressed his intention.

After hearing it, Teng Gong couldn’t help but laugh.

He put out the cigarette and said indifferently, “Qin Yu, why are you so naive?”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said with some confusion, “What do you mean?”

Teng Gong sneered and said, “If it was that Old Mister Yan from back then, I might be able to help you, but now...”

Teng Gong shook his head and didn’t continue, but his meaning was very clear.

Qin Yu opened his mouth to say something, but Teng Gong waved his hand and said, “I have already given him enough respect by seeing you.”

After saying that, Teng Gong waved his hand and ordered him to leave.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, then smiled and said, “Teng Gong, maybe I should change my way of expression.”

“Huh?” Teng Gong raised his eyebrows.

Qin Yu said, “Maybe we can work together.”

“Work together?” Teng Gong immediately burst into laughter.

“What kind of cooperation can there be between you and me? What qualifications do you have to work with me?” Teng Gong raised his eyebrows and said.

Qin Yu said with a nonchalant smile, “Although the Teng family has a powerful business empire, your martial power has always been extremely weak. The strongest is only a half-step Martial Marquis.”

“And no matter which Jingdu aristocratic family it is, not only do they have wealth, but they also control martial power. This is also the reason why the Teng family will never be able to compete with the Yan family.”

Teng Gong frowned slightly.

Although these words weren’t pleasant to hear, it was the truth.

Qin Yu stood up and said coldly, “I can make up for this.”

Teng Gong couldn’t help but sneer. “You? If you were a Martial Marquis, I might consider it, but you are only a half-step Martial Marquis, so where does your confidence come from?”

Qin Yu said indifferently, “Although I’m not a Martial Marquis, I can force the Saint Confucian Sect, which has a Martial Marquis, to bow their heads, and frustrate the high and mighty Yan family!”

“This is where my confidence comes from.”

Teng Gong seemed to be interested.

He touched his chin and thought for a moment, then stood up and said, “I can help you this time, but... you and I have to make an agreement.”

“Please speak, Teng Gong.” Qin Yu nodded.

Teng Gong said with a nonchalant smile, “If you can replace the Saint Confucian Sect within a month, I will acknowledge your abilities and agree to all your requests.”
