Chapter 1417: Chapter 1,417, the sect master’s misgivings

He looked at Qin Yu coldly with a complicated expression on his face.

“You came at the right time. I have something to tell you,”Qin Yu stood up and said.

The sect master raised his eyebrows and said, “You have something to tell me? Why? Do you want to beg for mercy?”

Qin Yu ignored this sentence and continued, “Ninety-nine percent of the reason why your son came to me and shouted is because of elder Bai.”

The sect master was stunned and continued, “Why do you say that?”

Qin Yu calmly analyzed, “Because the relationship between us has deteriorated, and the person who benefits the most is him.”

The sect master remained silent. In fact, he had long suspected elder Bai, but there was no evidence.

“If you didn’t do too many things to harm the heavenly cloud sect, I really don’t want to kill you,”the sect master said coldly.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Since things have come to this, it’s useless to say anything. However, you might not be able to kill me.”

The sect master frowned slightly and said, “You have already become a prisoner, yet you still dare to speak so shamelessly? I want to kill you, but it’s just a flip of my hand.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Sect master, I can see that not only are you powerful, but you are also quite scheming. It’s not an exaggeration to say that you have foresight.”

Sect master said indifferently, “Why? Are you flattering me?”

“If it was useful for me to flatter you, I would have done it long ago,”said Qin Yu.

“Also, can you not always interrupt me when I speak?”

Seeing Qin Yu’s attitude, sect master did not know whether to laugh or cry for a moment.

It was the first time he had seen a prisoner with such an attitude.

“Continue,”the sect leader said.

Qin Yu sneered, “Just as you said, if you want to kill me, you can do it at any time. Even if you want to tell the world, you don’t need three days.”

“The reason why you delayed for three days is because you are waiting for something, right?”Qin Yu asked.

“Waiting? What do you think I am waiting for?”The sect leader narrowed his eyes and said.

Qin Yu said indifferently, “You’re waiting. See if anyone comes to plead for mercy these few days, or ask you to release them.”

When he said this, the sect master’s expression suddenly changed!

Just as Qin Yu said, he had always suspected that Qin Yu had some powerful background.

During this period of time, he had also tried to investigate Qin Yu’s background, but found nothing.

For the sake of the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s future, he didn’t dare to rashly take action to get rid of Qin Yu, lest he bring disaster upon the heavenly cloud sect. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

After all, there were still many people in the holy region who were stronger than the Heavenly Cloud sect.

“The reason why you are so cautious, if I’m not wrong, you should know something,”Qin Yu said.

The sect master didn’t say anything, waiting for Qin Yu to continue.

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said, “Let me guess what information you have.”

“En... is it because the princess of the Yan family and I are from the same hometown? Are you afraid that I will know her?”Qin Yu grinned, revealing a mouthful of white teeth.

As soon as he said this, the sect master’s expression became even uglier.

He was shocked and angry. He was shocked that Qin Yu had seen through his thoughts, and angry that Qin Yu had nothing to fear.

“Looks like I guessed correctly.”Qin Yu said with narrowed eyes.

“You care about your son very much, but you seem to care more about the heavenly cloud sect.”

The sect master looked at Qin Yu coldly. He did not say a word, as if he was still waiting for something.

Seeing this, Qin Yu did not say anything more. He climbed up from the ground with difficulty, leaning against the wall, he said, “I won’t talk nonsense with you. I’ll tell you directly. What you’re worried about is true. Not only do I know Yan Ruoxue, but she’s also my wife.”

“Your Wife?”

Hearing this, the sect master almost laughed out loud.

“If she’s your wife, why would she leave you alone? Besides, if she’s your wife, why would she let you stay in the South Province?”The sect master sneered.

Qin Yu asked back, “Of course you think so. After all, you’ve protected your son so well that he knows nothing about the outside world.”

These words were obviously meant to mock the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, and at the same time, to remind him.

The sect master’s expression immediately turned extremely ugly.

He looked coldly at Qin Yu and said, “You might know the princess of the Yan family, but I don’t believe your words.”

Saying this, the sect master turned around and planned to leave.

He took less than two steps before he stopped again and said, “The execution will be carried out as usual in two days. If you really have a relationship with the Yan family, they will come to save you in detail.”

After saying this, the sect master turned around and left without turning back.

Qin Yu was immediately anxious and angry. He could not help but curse, “This B * stard, he actually left just like that!”

Qin Yu originally intended to scare him, but he did not expect that this competition was actually going to use extreme pressure.

In this way, Qin Yu was really riding a tiger and had no way out.

He did have the token in his hand, but he did not want to use it at all.

Qin Yu was only in the nascent soul realm, and he didn’t even have any spiritual power in his body. How could he have the face to ask Yan Ruoxue for help.

“Damn it!”Qin Yu couldn’t help but clench his teeth.

Di Zun said from the side, “Master, since you know Yan Ruoxue, why don’t you call them over? You Can’t just wait for death, right?”

Qin Yu was silent. After thinking for a moment, Qin Yu leaned against the wall and muttered, “We’ll talk about it later. Maybe Things Will Change.”

...

In the next few days.

The sect master did not appear again, and the situation did not turn for the better.

In the blink of an eye, it was the day of the execution.

On this morning, Qin Yu was brought out of the heavenly prison and all the way to the largest training ground of the Heavenly Cloud sect.

This place was already full of people. Many people were waiting to watch a good show.

Qin Yu was brought to the execution platform by a few people. He was tied up and unable to move.

“TSK TSK, this Qin Yu still fell into the hands of the Heavenly Cloud sect in the end.”

“Yeah, going against the Heavenly Cloud sect won’t end well.”

“It’s said that the sect master personally captured him.”

Hearing the surrounding discussions, Qin Yu’s expression became even uglier.

He wanted to crush that token, but he realized that his hand could no longer move, and he could not touch that token at all.

“Damn it...”Qin Yu could not help but secretly clench his teeth.

Above, the sect master looked at the Great Elder.

“You will personally execute him.”The sect master looked at the Great Elder and said.

The reason for this arrangement was that he was worried that the great elder would damage his dao heart because of Qin Yu’s matter, and would stagnate.

The great elder naturally understood the sect master’s intentions. He hurriedly bowed and said, “Thank you, Sect Master!”

With that said, the great elder’s feet shook and he arrived in front of Qin Yu.

He gritted his teeth and looked at Qin Yu, saying, “You damned little bastard. I said that I would definitely kill you with my own hands...”
