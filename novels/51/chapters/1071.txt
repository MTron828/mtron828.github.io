Chapter 1072: Chapter 1,072, the strength of the eight higher-ups 

Zhai Xing’s guess wasn’t without reason.

Just as he had said, after the seal loosened, there would naturally be great dao qi flowing through the passageway and into the present world.

“In that case, do we have a chance to step into the Almighty Realm?”Qin Yu asked in puzzlement.

“No.”Zhai Xing shook his head.

“Although the seal has loosened, it’s still not enough to support us stepping into the Almighty Realm,”said Zhai Xing.

Speaking up to this point, Zhai Xing swept his gaze toward immortal crane and the others and continued, “Now that the higher-ups have announced that they will think of a way to open this passage, there are probably only two reasons.”

“Either the seal’s collapse is already unstoppable, or your appearance has made them feel danger. Therefore, they would rather take the risk of breaking the seal to step into the second mystic realm and get rid of you.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but look at Star Seizer in surprise.

One had to say that star Seizer’s analysis was extremely reasonable. It seemed that he wasn’t a martial artist.

“It’s most likely that the seal is already unstoppable,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“I think so too.”

As a result, they were in a dilemma.

If the seal completely collapsed, then the higher-ups would have already attacked to get rid of Qin Yu

If it didn’t collapse, then they would never have the chance to become a mighty figure.

“That’s not right.”At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

“There was a mighty figure who stepped into this world before. What method did they use?”Qin Yu frowned.

Zhai Xing glanced at Qin Yu and said, “According to the records of the martial arts association in Jingdu, they might have crossed the void.”

“Crossed the Void?”Qin Yu was shocked.

In other words, the almighty from the Yan family had crossed the Void to come here?

“Then why can’t the higher-ups use this method?”Qin Yu asked in puzzlement.

“Because they can’t do it.”Immortal Crane shook its head.

“Setting up an array platform requires an unimaginable amount of money. Those so-called higher-ups probably don’t have the ability, so they can only hide in the first secret realm.”

Zhai Xing did not make any comments on this, but he obviously agreed with Immortal Crane’s words. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Qin Yu could not help but be a little shocked.

As expected, the world of cultivation was extremely complicated, far beyond imagination.

The world in front of them did not seem to be as wide as imagined.

“Take us to the vicinity of the seal,”immortal crane stood up and said.

Zhai Xing glanced at immortal crane and shook his head. “I don’t know where it is.”

“You don’t Know?”A hint of displeasure flashed across the immortal Crane’s brows.

“I really don’t know. Every time the higher-ups appear, it’s extremely abrupt. No one knows where he came from,”said Zhai Xing.

The immortal crane said coldly, “Then wouldn’t we have come for Nothing?”

Qin Yu said with a bitter smile, “Don’t be too anxious. So what if we find it now? Can we open the seal with our ability?”

“Moreover, even if we do open it, do we dare to rashly go to the first secret realm?”

Immortal Crane didn’t say anything. Although it was unwilling to admit it, it was the truth.

“Then what is there in this place? What treasure can increase cultivation?”Qin Yu looked at Zhai Xing and continued to ask.

Zhai Xing said in a deep voice, “There is. It is a cultivation magic tool given by the higher-ups.”

“Where is it?”Qin Yu asked quickly.

Zhai Xing opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something, but then he shook his head and said, “You guys come with me.”

Thereupon, Qin Yu and Immortal Crane followed behind Zhai Xing and walked toward the depths of the palace.

At the end of the palace, there was a waterfall hanging upside down.

The current here was quite rapid, and the water vapor was dense.

Zhai Xing’s body flashed as he passed through the level of the waterfall. It was unknown where he was running to.

Qin Yu and Xian he exchanged a glance before following closely behind and stepping into the waterfall.

After passing through the waterfall, they saw an extremely small secret chamber inside. On the wall of the secret chamber, there was a painting.

This painting was somewhat similar to the one in the demon city. There was also the circulation of internal Qi, making it extremely strange.

The difference was that there were eight figures on this painting. Although their backs were facing the crowd, Qin Yu could still see their identities.

“These are the portraits of the eight higher-ups,”Qin Yu said.

Zhai xing grunted and said, “In this portrait, you can fight with the eight higher-ups, and you can choose their strength on your own.”

“For example, you can choose to fight at the same realm, or you can choose their true realm.”

“Of course, all of this is an illusion of divine sense, not a real fight.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu was instantly overjoyed!

“In other words, through this portrait, I can know the true strength of those eight higher-ups?”Qin Yu said with some excitement.

Zhai xing grunted and said, “In theory.”

“That’s Great!”Qin Yu touched his chin.

“In this way, I can clearly know the gap between them.”

Not only that, he would not be injured in this picture. Even if he died, it would only be an illusion.

“This picture is not risk-free.”At this time, the immortal crane suddenly said.

“If you die inside, it is very likely to cause your main body to fake death, just like a vegetable.”The immortal crane glanced at Zhai Xing, intentionally or unintentionally.

Zhai Xing nodded slightly and said, “That’s right.”

“So you’d better be careful,”said the immortal crane.

Qin Yu nodded repeatedly and said, “I got it. I will be careful.”

After saying that, he closed his eyes slightly and planned to send out a strand of divine sense to fight with these eight high-ranking officials.

“Are you in such a hurry?”Immortal Crane frowned and asked.

Qin Yu licked his lips and said, “I can’t wait to know the true strength of these eight high-ranking officials.”
