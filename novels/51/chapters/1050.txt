Chapter 1051: [ chapter one thousand and fifty-one, all of you will die here! ]! 

With the boost from the immortal crane, Qin Yu’s confidence grew even more.

The true strength of the immortal crane, was something Qin Yu had never seen before. But for him to be able to be on par with Qin Yu at the same cultivation level, it was enough to prove his ability.

The group of people then made their way towards the fire country in a vast and mighty pyro.

And at that moment, the great battle at the Heaven Gate had already sunk into a state of anxiety.

Finally, Jiang he’s Dou zi technique began to slowly disappear.

His internal Qi that had increased by several tens of times had also returned to its normal state.

“Hahahaha!”

When Chi Hou saw that, he could not help but burst out laughing loudly!

“Without that secret technique of yours, how are you going to fight against me?”Chi Hou shouted out in excitement.

He had relied on his internal Qi that he almost did not wither, and he did not place the current Jiang he in his eyes at all!

Jiang he was still calm. He said indifferently, “Even without the secret technique, you might not be able to take me down.”

“Is that so? So what? Your Heaven Gate has suffered heavy losses. I’m afraid it will be difficult for you to recover your internal Qi in a short time, right?”Chi Hou sneered.

Jiang he could not help but look at the Heaven Gate.

The Heaven Gate had indeed suffered heavy losses. Countless disciples had died here, and countless were injured.

One Thousand Martial Marquis. This force was too powerful. Even Jiang he could not deal with so many people.

“Everyone, listen up. Kill Jiang he for me!”Chi Hou said coldly.

“Yes!”

The Martial Marquis in the second secret realm was like a swarm of flies. They surrounded Jiang he in the center.

“There are so many martial marquis. Even if you are a martial saint, you might not be able to withstand them,”Chi Hou said indifferently.

“Moreover, you have the support of a martial saint. How are you going to deal with them?”

Jiang he remained silent. However, a trace of ruthlessness flashed across his calm face.

“Then don’t blame me for starting a massacre,”Jiang he said indifferently. Then, he gently extended his palm and a wisp of internal Qi spread out in all directions with him as the center.

The surrounding martial marquis were immediately pushed back. However, as martial marquis, they all had rich combat experience. They retreated almost instantly.

Chi Hou crossed his arms in front of his chest and watched coldly from the side.

He didn’t even have the intention to attack. Instead, he quietly watched as the nearly 1,000 martial marquis tortured Jiang he to death!

“Boom!”

A great battle was about to break out. Jiang he’s internal Qi swept out like a surging sea.

His valiant and heroic appearance crushed everyone!

Although Jiang he’s strength was incomparably powerful, it was still difficult for him to fight against four hands with two fists.

During the battle with Chi Hou, his internal Qi had become even weaker. Now that he was facing a large number of martial marquis, Jiang he gradually fell into a disadvantageous position.

Waves of internal Qi shot over, and the resplendent brilliance caused Jiang he to continuously retreat.

He did not have Qin Yu’s fierce body, so he could not completely ignore the martial marquis’attacks!

“Boom!”

Under the joint attack of dozens of martial marquis, Jiang he was forced back, and his body sank into the ground!

His blood flowed out from his bones and his spiritual sense seemed to be trembling slightly.

More than a hundred martial marquis unleashed their killing techniques at the same time. Even Jiang he, who was in the martial saint realm, could not deal with them.

Chi Hou, who was not far away, looked on coldly as if he was waiting for Jiang He’s death.

However, at this moment, Jiang he suddenly rose up from the ground and his internal Qi swept across the entire Heaven Gate once again!

“Eh?”Chi Hou could not help but frown when he saw this, and there was a hint of surprise in his eyes.

Jiang he, who was originally dispirited with his internal QI, seemed to have recovered to his peak at this moment!

He looked down on the entire scene with his peerless bearing!

“Burning his blood essence?”

Chi Hou suddenly guessed something, and then he could not help but sneer, “Dog, you actually rose up again at the cost of your life. Do you think it’s useful!”

The surrounding Martial Marquis joined hands and released a sure-kill technique!

As the Warriors of the second secret realm, they naturally possessed a combined secret technique.

This wasn’t a simple one plus one equals two, but a qualitative change!

With the support of the various secret techniques of the martial arts association of Jingdu, the combined strength of a hundred martial marquis wasn’t any weaker than a martial saint!

The great battle continued. Jiang he used his life as the price and vowed to resist to the death.

Along with Jiang he’s desperate struggle, several martial marquis were thrown off the field. Their physical bodies were shattered, and their souls were destroyed.

The fierce Jiang he was like a killing God. His every move was filled with murderous intent.

Even Chi Hou was slightly impressed by Jiang he’s strength.

With such an expert in the Heaven Gate, it was no wonder that Qin Yu dared to challenge the second secret realm. It was also no wonder that the star harvesters had repeatedly let Jiang he off because of the scarcity of talents!

In the blink of an eye, Jiang he had already forced back nearly a hundred martial marquis!

However, his body was also severely injured, and he fell to the ground for the second time.

“Come, let me see how many times you can burn your blood essence!”Chi Hou strode forward, his eyes bursting with intense killing intent.

The number of times the blood essence was burned was limited, and each time the blood essence was burned, it would bring about great injuries.

Not only would it affect one’s lifespan, but it would also damage one’s foundation!

Jiang he struggled to get up from the ground for the second time.

He looked at Chi Hou coldly and said, “Before my blood essence burns out, I can at least kill all of you!”

There was sadness in his tone, but it was more arrogant and domineering!

This unparalleled confidence and domineering aura made everyone feel excited for a moment!

“Haha! Then you should try it!”Chi Hou shouted. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Just as Jiang he was about to burn his blood essence for the second time, a golden light descended from the sky.

He passed through everyone like a golden light, like a rolling chariot. The flesh and blood of the people he touched flew everywhere!

In the blink of an eye, he had created a bloody path and arrived in front of Jiang he!

“You don’t need to burn your blood essence. You will die here today.”

The cold voice went through his ears and into his heart!
