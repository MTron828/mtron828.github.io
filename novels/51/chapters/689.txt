Chapter 690: No One Shall Be Spared! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The internal qi of the Martial Saint Weapon swept over swiftly.

Just a trace of residual power had forced Qin Yu to retreat repeatedly.

Qin Yu hurriedly urged Robust to block in front of him, in order to resist the residual power of the Martial Saint Weapon’s internal qi.

At this moment, the internal qi emitted by the Prajna ruler had already crushed towards Burly.

Qin Yu laughed coldly. He immediately used his divine sense to urge Burly to raise his palm and meet it.

Burly opened his huge palm and directly grabbed at the trace of the Martial Saint Weapon’s internal qi.

“You’re looking for death!” Qu Xie could not help but shout when he saw this.

The internal qi of the Martial Saint Weapon became even stronger as if it wanted to kill Burly in one strike.

But what kind of existence was Burly? He was the guardian of the masked woman’s tomb, an existence that surpassed the almighty.

His body was definitely not something a Martial Saint could injure.

Burly’s big hand pressed forward and easily withstood the residual power emitted by the Martial Saint Weapon.

That internal qi kept retreating under Burly’s palm.

Qu Xie’s eyes instantly widened, and his face turned extremely pale.

What the hell was this?! He blocked a Martial Saint’s Weapon so easily just by using his palm?!

Even a current Martial Saint might not be able to do it so easily, right?

Before Qu Xie could regain his senses, Burly’s palm had already approached him.

Qu Xie’s expression changed, and he wanted to run away.

However, how could Qin Yu give him the chance? He immediately urged Robust to take a step forward and block the door.

Robust had a strong build and blocked the door tightly.

Burly even stretched out his hand and snatched the Prajna ruler.

“You... give it back to me!” Qu Xie immediately became anxious.

He stretched out his hand, wanting to snatch back the Prajna ruler, but he was slapped away by Burly.

Then, Burly handed the Prajna ruler to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu took the Prajna ruler and could not help but grin. “I didn’t expect to have such an unexpected harvest... This Martial Saint Weapon belongs to me now!”

Qu Xie’s expression was extremely unsightly. Losing a Martial Saint Weapon was a huge matter.

“Qin Yu, return the Prajna ruler to me! As long as you return it to me, I can agree to any conditions!” Qu Xie said anxiously.

Qin Yu raised his brows and said, “Alright, as long as you let me take Yan Ruoxue away, I’ll return this broken ruler to you.”

When this topic was brought up, Qu Xie’s brows instantly furrowed.

He glanced at Burly and Robust, then took a deep breath and said, “Qin Yu, it’s impossible for you to take Yan Ruoxue away.”

“Impossible?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes. “Qu Xie, do you think I’m here to negotiate with you? As long as I’m willing, I can destroy your Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”

Qu Xie said coldly, “Although I don’t know who these two people are, I’m telling you, no matter how strong they are, they can’t fight against the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”

“Cut the crap.” Qin Yu stood up.

He strode to Qu Xie and said coldly, “I’ve made myself clear. I’m not here to negotiate with you. I’ll take her away today. I’ll kill whoever dares to stop me!”

After saying that, Qin Yu put away the Prajna ruler and strode out of the conference room.

Qu Xie hurriedly shouted, “Wait! Qin Yu, give me some time to think about it. What do you think?”

“You want to stall for time? Do you think I’m an idiot?” Qin Yu said coldly.

The two Guardians could only be controlled for three days at most. Qin Yu wouldn’t give Qu Xie any chance at all.

He controlled the two Guardians and strode toward the prison.

Qu Xie was extremely anxious, but he couldn’t do anything to the two Guardians!

Even the Martial Saint Weapon couldn’t do anything to them, so what could stop Qin Yu?

With these two guardians, Qin Yu could be said to be able to kill Gods and Buddhas if they were in his way. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

They walked all the way to the entrance of the prison and Burly smashed the supposedly indestructible door with a punch.

Then, Qin Yu strode into the prison.

“Qin Yu? Why are you back?”

“No way, you were caught by them again?”

Countless people on both sides greeted Qin Yu with a warm attitude.

Qin Yu nodded his head one by one and then rushed towards the direction of Yan Ruoxue’s cell.

Soon, Qin Yu arrived in front of the entrance of the cell where Yan Ruoxue was imprisoned.

Standing in front of the door, Qin Yu’s expression darkened.

Because there was no one in this cell. There was no sign of Yan Ruoxue at all.

“Where is she? Where is Yan Ruoxue?!” Qin Yu anxiously looked at the other prisons.

“Miss Yan was taken away a few days ago,” Said the person in the prison cell next to him.

Qin Yu’s face immediately changed. He gritted his teeth and hurriedly ran into the conference room.

In the conference room, Qu Xie was about to report the news when Qin Yu rushed over.

He grabbed Qu Xie’s collar and said coldly, “Where is Yan Ruoxue?”

Qu Xie frowned and asked, “What do you mean?”

“Stop pretending!” Qin Yu grabbed Qu Xie’s neck.

Qu Xie wanted to resist, but Qin Yu’s hand was so strong that Qu Xie couldn’t move at all.

“I don’t understand what you’re saying!” Qu Xie gritted his teeth and said.

“What the f*ck are you talking about! Yan Ruoxue isn’t in prison at all!” Qin Yu roared angrily, and his grip became stronger and stronger.

Qu Xie’s face immediately turned red, and he found it difficult to breathe.

He said with difficulty, “I... I told you, I don’t know... If the higher-ups want to take her away, they wouldn’t ask for my permission...”

Qin Yu stared at Qu Xie. His anger almost making him lose his mind.

Qu Xie’s face turned purple as if he was going to suffocate at any moment.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and let go of Qu Xie.

“You’d better not lie to me,” Qin Yu said to Qu Xie coldly.

Qu Xie panted and said coldly, “Do you think I have the final say in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association? You think too highly of me!”

“Why do the higher-ups need to explain things to me?”

Qin Yu stood there and didn’t speak for a long time.

A moment later, Qin Yu picked up Qu Xie, grabbed his clothes, and walked to the Hall of the Association.

At this time, there were many members of the association in the hall.

They looked at Qin Yu nervously, and there was a hint of fear in the depths of their eyes.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said coldly, “Tell the higher-ups of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association that I will take Qu Xie away today and ask them to exchange him for Yan Ruoxue.”

“If I don’t see Yan Ruoxue in three days, I will kill Qu Xie and destroy the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!” Qin Yu gnashed his teeth and said.

After saying this, Qin Yu threw Qu Xie to Burly.

In Burly’s hands, Qu Xie was like a little chick, unable to move.

Then, Qin Yu took out the bronze sword in his hand and slashed out.

The terrifying sword light instantly passed through the hall and directly slashed toward the tall building not far away.

Under this sword attack, the roof was immediately flattened, and then the entire building began to buzz.

“If I don’t see Yan Ruoxue in three days... No one shall be spared!”

Qin Yu said coldly. His voice was bone-chilling, making people tremble in fear.
