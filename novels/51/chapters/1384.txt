Chapter 1385: Chapter 1,385, who exactly are you

Ding Yi felt as if a fishbone was stuck in his throat when he met Qin Yu’s cold gaze.

He couldn’t say anything at this moment.

She stared blankly at the “Coolie”in front of her and suddenly felt extremely unfamiliar.

It was as if she had changed into a different person in an instant.

Qin Yu looked around. Fortunately, there weren’t too many people in the library, which gave Qin Yu a glimmer of comfort.

“Be careful,”Qin Yu said to Ding Yi.

Then, Qin Yu turned around and walked into the depths of the library.

Ding Yi was just an ordinary person. Normally, no one would spend effort to kill her.

What happened today was probably just an accident.

She came all the way to the location of the South Province history book. As soon as she got close, a book attracted Qin Yu’s attention.

He saw a book with a yellow cover with a few big words written on it: South Province’s experts ranking list.

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and was immediately interested.

He picked up the book casually and slowly opened it.

This book was very thin and only had a few pages. Most of the records on it were of the South Province’s famous figures.

“Three madmen, three unique legends...”Qin Yu whispered these few words.

This seemed to be the famous title of the South Province, and it recorded seven people.

The first page introduced the three lunatics of the South Province.

And the person in the first place was none other than the unique dance that Qin Yu was familiar with!

Unique dance was the number one person of the three lunatics, and it recorded some of her extremely ridiculous deeds, as well as the people she had killed when she went crazy.

Although her actions were far inferior to that of the masked woman, they were still beginning to take shape.

“I didn’t expect Jue Wu to be the number one among the three maniacs,”Qin Yu thought to herself.

The remaining two were named Baro and Feng Hai. These two people were somewhat similar to Jue Wu. They were both extremely crazy people who did things.

“Huh? There’s actually no Wen Wanyi?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but be a little surprised.

Was it because his actions weren’t crazy enough, or was it because his strength wasn’t enough?

Qin Yu rubbed his chin. From Wen Wanyi’s attitude toward Jue Wu, it was obvious that his strength wasn’t as good as Jue Wu’s.

Perhaps Wen Wanyi’s strength was a level lower than these people’s.

Qin Yu silently hid these names in his heart, and then continued to read.

The second page recorded the three unique skills.

These three unique skills were Qu Zhu, monk Hong Xi, and Mister Yong Ji.

Qu Zhu’s deeds were very few, but they were extremely glorious.

It only recorded that Qu Zhu had once defeated the deputy sect master of Tianyun sect in eight rounds, causing him to be heavily injured.

The deputy sect master’s strength was self-evident, and he was one of the top in the entire Tianyun sect.

He was probably the number one person other than the first elder and the sect master.

Such a battle result was indeed dazzling.

It must be known that back then, Wen Wanyi had spent a lot of effort to win against the first elder.

“As expected of the three uniques,”Qin Yu thought to himself. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The second person’s deeds were even less recorded. He directly said that Monk Hong Xi was the number one monk in the current era. Other than that, there were no other deeds.

And Mister Yong Ji’s deeds were the most among these people.

It was said that he had monopolized a city and named it Yongji City.

And in Yongji City, there was another Yongji mansion.

This Yongji mansion was extremely huge and luxurious. It was said that there were people singing and singing every night in the Yongji mansion, and there were celebrities coming to visit every day.

Although he appeared to be alone on the surface, he was secretly a branch and possessed extremely strong power.

The difference between him and the others was that most of the disciples of others were disciples.

Mr. Yongji, on the other hand, accepted foster sons. It was said that he had more than a hundred foster sons.

“Mr. Yongji is quite a schemer. His influence is enough to rank second in the South Province,”Qin Yu whispered.

Other than that, there was also a long description of him.

These descriptions seemed quite ordinary, but the words were full of contempt, portraying him as a despicable person.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown, and there was some doubt in his eyes.

Since he was a despicable person, why was he called Mister?

Which person who was called Mister wasn’t respected by others?

I wonder who wrote this book, Qin Yu thought to himself.

But at this moment, Qin Yu had a bad feeling about Mister Yongji.

The last person recorded was a legend.

Since he was called a legend, his strength must be even more terrifying than the three madmen and three uniques.

The name of a legend was Xiao Hai, and the records about Xiao Hai were even more elaborate.

The description about him was exactly the opposite of Mister Yong Ji.

Mister Yong Ji was described as a despicable person, while Xiao Hai was described as a hero who stood tall and strong.

There were many chapters on how Xiao Hai acted righteously, was not afraid of power, and saved people in distress. Although his strength was not described much, it was written that he once saved a city of ordinary people.

There were many descriptions about Xiao Hai, and they were written very vividly. Even Qin Yu could not help but sigh at his heroic spirit after reading them, and even felt admiration in his heart.

“Who is this Xiao Hai? Why have I never heard of him before?”Qin Yu whispered.

He closed the book and said in a low voice, “If there’s a chance, I must make friends with him.”

At this moment, Ding Yi walked over from the side.

“It’s getting late. Should we go back?”Ding Yi’s tone was obviously a little nervous.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “It’s indeed time to go back. Otherwise, boss Zheng will be angry.”

Ding Yi grunted. She followed behind Qin Yu and walked out of the library.

On the way back, Ding Yi’s mouth opened slightly. It was obvious that he had something to say.

“If you have something to say, just say it,”Qin Yu said.

Ding Yi grunted. She mustered up her courage and asked, “Who are you exactly? I’ve already seen it. Your Hand isn’t injured at all.”
