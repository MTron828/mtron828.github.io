Chapter 314: Jingdu, Here I Come! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Xiao Yu’s worries were not without reason.

With her constitution, she would be targeted sooner or later.

“I know the story between you and Ruoxue, as well as the agreement between you and Han Wei,” Xiao Yu said.

“Before, I thought that you weren’t good enough for Ruoxue, but now, I think that only you are good enough for her, so you must win.”

“If I can really help you improve your strength, I... I think I can help you.”

At the end of her sentence, Xiao Yu’s voice was as small as a mosquito’s.

“Don’t talk nonsense. Don’t have such thoughts in the future,” Qin Yu said with a straight face.

“I don’t need your help to win against Han Wei. As for you... I will do my best to protect you,” Qin Yu squatted down and said.

Xiao Yu immediately said, “Then it’s settled. If anything happens to me, you have to take responsibility.”

“Okay, okay, okay. I’ll take responsibility,” Qin Yu said somewhat helplessly.

“Hurry up and meditate. Don’t waste time.”

Xiao Yu agreed, then walked back to her original seat and sat down.

Qin Yu glanced at Jiang Gu, and then the two of them walked under the ghostly face.

Looking up at the ghostly face condensed in the sky, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

What exactly was buried under the ground that could cause such a terrifying phenomenon?

“Mr. Qin, what do you need me to do?” Jiang Gu asked.

Qin Yu pointed at the ground under his feet and said, “Dig down from here. Dig as deep as you can. Dig until you reach something.”

Jiang Gu nodded. It had to be said that Jiang Gu’s body made him a good candidate for digging the ground.

As the two of them moved, a large hole appeared in the ground.

The hole became deeper and deeper. In the blink of an eye, they had dug more than ten meters.

Unfortunately, there was nothing below.

“Could it be that I dug in the wrong place?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

“Mr. Qin, do you want to continue digging?” Jiang Gu asked.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Continue digging!”

Therefore, the two of them started digging again.

It was another ten meters, but they still didn’t see anything.

At this time, the sky had gradually darkened. Qin Yu and Jiang Gu were also exhausted and sweating.

“Did I really dig in the wrong place? Or... did I guess wrong? The thing isn’t underground at all?” Qin Yu began to doubt.

He tried to feel the dark energy around him, but he found that it didn’t come from underground at all. Instead, it seemed to be surging from all directions.

“Do we still need to dig?” Jiang Gu said while panting.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Forget it. Let’s go up first.”

Jiang Gu agreed, and the two of them drilled out of the underground hole.

“Mr. Qin, what should we do now?” Jiang Gu asked.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “Let’s go back first.”

“Go back? Just let it go?” Jiang Gu said in surprise.

Qin Yu forced a smile and said, “Maybe I guessed wrong. If we really can’t get it, it only means that this thing doesn’t belong to me in the first place.”

Jiang Gu didn’t say anything more.

Then, the three of them left.

In the next few days, Qin Yu refined pills for the Longhu team in advance and asked Yao Qing to send it to the Military District.

Then, Qin Yu brought Xiao Yu to the battlefield for the whole day to cultivate in seclusion.

Time flew by. In the blink of an eye, more than twenty days had passed.

There were only three days left until the official competition.

Early that morning, Qin Yu arrived at the Chuzhou region.

On the training ground, Xue Hu was training his team members strenuously.

When they saw Qin Yu, the team members shouted, “Mr. Qin is here!”

Hearing this, Hu Xue immediately turned to look at Qin Yu.

“Mr. Qin.” Hu Xue greeted Qin Yu.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Officer Xue, how’s the training?”

Hu Xue gave Qin Yu a thumbs up and said, “Your method is really amazing! In just one month, the strength of the team members has changed qualitatively!”

The rest of the team members also shouted, “Mr. Qin, it’s all thanks to you. Your plan is too awesome!”

“Yes, and after I ate the pill you sent me, I actually broke through to the Inner Strength Past Master stage!”

Upon hearing the excited shouts of the crowd, Qin Yu nodded slightly.

“Okay, everyone, train yourselves!” Hu Xue shouted.

After giving the order, Hu Xue looked at Qin Yu with a smile and said, “Mr. Qin, let’s go to the office. Commander Long also wants to see you.”

“Okay.” Qin Yu nodded and followed Xue Hu to the office.

In the office, Commander Long was sipping tea with a satisfied look on his face.

“Commander Long, Mr. Qin is here.” At this time, the door was pushed open.

As soon as he saw Qin Yu, Commander Long immediately came up to him.

He said with a smile, “Qin Yu, I just want to talk to you about something. Come, sit down quickly.”

Qin Yu sat in front of Commander Long, and Xue Hu hurriedly poured a cup of tea for Qin Yu.

“To be honest, your plan is really beyond my imagination.” Commander Long gave Qin Yu a thumbs up.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “It’s fine as long as it works. By the way, Commander Long, what do you want to talk to me about?”

Commander Long was silent for a moment, and then said, “Your plan is indeed awesome, but... I don’t want us to get first place.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said, “What do you mean?”

Commander Long sighed and said, “It’s enough if we can get second place.”

“Commander Long, you don’t have confidence in the Longhu team?” Qin Yu said with some puzzlement.

“No.” Commander Long waved his hand.

“What I mean is, whether we can win or not, we don’t want to fight for first place.”

This made Qin Yu somewhat puzzled. He couldn’t help but ask, “Commander Long, if we can get first place, why do we want to get second place?”

“Gee, Qin Yu, you’re still young. This competition isn’t just about strength. Sometimes, we also have to consider other aspects.”

“After all, the Jingdu Military District is a team led by Ye Qing. They have been the champion for many years. If they lose, will Ye Qing be happy?”

“Think about it carefully. This is also for your good. The tall poppy gets cut first.”

Hearing Commander Long’s words, Qin Yu sneered and said, “Commander Long, I believe that Ye Qing isn’t such a petty person. If that’s really the case, he wouldn’t have become the idol of all the soldiers.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Although that’s the case, things are unpredictable. In short, just do as I say.” Commander Long waved his hand.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, then nodded and said, “Alright, I’ll agree to it.”

Commander Long nodded approvingly and said with a smile, “Alright, go back and get ready. We’ll leave for Jingdu on time the morning of the day after tomorrow!”

At the mention of Jingdu, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little excited.

He agreed and turned to leave the Military District.

Standing at the entrance of the Military District, Qin Yu couldn’t help but look to the north and whispered, “Jingdu, here I come.”
