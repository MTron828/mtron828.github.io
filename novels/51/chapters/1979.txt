1980 Wreaking Havoc in Sky City

Soon, the prince also received the news.

He hurried to Qin Yu’s residence with a worried look on his face.

“Mr. Qin, Jue Wu…” The prince went straight to the point and expressed the purpose of his visit.

Qin Yu raised his head to look at the prince and said in a deep voice, “Yes, Jue Wu did it.”

“Your Highness, don’t worry. I’ll take responsibility for what I’ve done,” Jue Wu patted her chest and said.

“By doing this, aren’t you indirectly admitting to their slander?” the prince sighed and said.

“So what if I admit it, or I do not? They’re just looking for an excuse. Even if I try my best to prove my innocence, they’ll find another excuse,” Qin Yu said, shaking his head.

Hearing Qin Yu’s words, the prince did not say anything further.

“You and I have become brothers in the same boat now,” he said with a bitter smile.

Qin Yu remained silent. He had come to this point purely because he had been forced by the aristocratic families.

“Let’s wait and see. They’ll take action soon,” the prince said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu was not anxious. He said, smiling, “The rules of Sky City are still in place. I don’t think they’ll proactively break the rules.”

Then Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

He got up and said, “Your Highness, didn’t they want to force you to break this rule first? Let me force them to do so in helping you.”

The prince was somewhat surprised and did not seem to understand what Qin Yu meant.

“Just wait and see. After this rule is broken, I will immediately leave Sky City,” Qin Yu said gloomily.

“Mr. Qin, don’t act recklessly,” the prince seemed somewhat worried.

“Don’t worry. I know what I’m doing,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

After the prince left, Qin Yu turned around and looked at Jue Wu.

“Jue Wu, you can create as much trouble as you want from tomorrow onward. The bigger, the better! Sky City seems to be a single entity, but it has already been divided in reality,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“From tomorrow onward, pick the properties of the Si family and the Yao family, and destroy them with all your might. However, you must not hurt anyone, and you must not make a move. You must remember, you must not smoke a move.”

Jue Wu rubbed her hands and said, “Okay, I understand.”

No matter what, Qin Yu wanted to force the people of the Si family or the Yao family to make the first move and break the rule.

The following day, Jue Wu went out as requested by Qin Yu. She began to plunder and loot everywhere.

The Si family and the Yao family were the first to bear the brunt, and many of their businesses were ruined by Jue Wu.

Qin Yu was waiting quietly in the Imperial Palace.

Sitting in the Great Hall, he was waiting for the auction house people to arrive.

People from the nine great aristocratic families were in the Great Hall. They looked at Qin Yu with hostility, especially those from the Si family.

Qin Yu didn’t move. Sitting by the table, he was drinking tea by himself.

“Qin Yu, let me tell you. The head of our family is back. You can’t be arrogant for long,” one of the cultivators walked forward and said coldly.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “Who are you? Where did you come from?”

Upon hearing this, the cultivator instantly rebuked, “I’m from the Si family. Kid, mind your words!”

“Oh! The head of the Si family is back, right?” Qin Yu touched his chin. “So, it’s time for them to fulfill their promise to me!”

“Promise? You mean the Skywater Prison matter?” The cultivator instantly understood.

“You want the family head to open the Skywater Prison, do you?” he sneered and said. “It’s very simple. As long as you go to the Si family, the family head will definitely send you to the Skywater Prison to meet your brother!”

Qin Yu said with his eyes slightly narrowed, “Everyone in Sky City heard it. Si Shifeng has promised me. Why? Are you now going back on your word in front of everyone?”

“Hahaha! Qin Yu, you’ve stolen from the Si family and the auction house. You’re a total evildoer now! When dealing with an evildoer, why is there a need to talk about integrity?” The cultivator sneered.

Speaking up to this point, the cultivator said smugly, “Moreover, that was only a personal promise by Young Master Feng. It doesn’t affect the Si family.”

Qin Yu had already guessed the outcome. He slowly got up and said, “If the Si family dares to go back on their word, I will definitely cause chaos in the Si family.”

“Do you have the ability to do that?” The cultivator mocked.

Qin Yu stood up, cleared his throat, and said, “Listen up. The Si family is nothing but a pile of sh*t in my eyes. Everyone in the Si family is trash. Regardless of Holy Son, I’ll stomp him to death with a foot.

The cultivator was stunned for a moment, and said angrily, “What nonsense are you talking about? Are you courting death?”

“What? You want to hit me, do you? Come on, do it.” Qin Yu sneered and said.

“You!” The cultivator gritted his teeth and said, “If we weren’t in Sky City, I guarantee you’ll have to bear the consequences!”

“You’ve said it wrong,” Qin Yu said sarcastically. “It’s the rules of Sky City that are protecting you. Otherwise, do you think I would waste so much time talking nonsense with a small character like you? I would have already smashed your head with a slap.”

Just as the two were arguing, a powerful internal qi suddenly appeared in the Imperial Palace.

This internal qi was tremendously oppressive. Even Qin Yu felt somewhat uneasy.

He turned his head and looked into the distance, only to see a white-robed elderly man walking over with several people.

The white-robed elderly man was none other than the famous president of the auction house, Yang Tong.

Soon, Yang Tong stepped into the Great Hall. His eyes swept across the crowd and then fell on Qin Yu.

“President Yang,” the people in the surroundings greeted him.

Hearing this, Qin Yu knew his identity. Not only did he not show any respect, but he also sat down and continued drinking tea.

Yang Tong was slightly displeased by his behavior. He lowered his head, looking down at Qin Yu, and said, “You’re Qin Yu?”

Qin Yu ignored him and continued drinking his tea.

...

“Are you that Qin Yu?” Yang Tong asked again. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Qin Yu still ignored him.

“How audacious! President Yang is talking to you. Are you deaf?” someone beside him shouted.

Qin Yu laughed and said, “I didn’t hear anyone talking. I only heard dogs barking. I couldn’t understand dogs barking. How did you understand?”

Before the other party could say anything, Qin Yu immediately made an expression of sudden realization and said, “Oh yes. Of course, dogs can understand what dogs are saying. Hahaha!”

The crowd was instantly enraged by Qin Yu, and Yang Tong’s expression was tremendously cold.

He took a deep breath, suppressed his anger, and said, “Qin Yu, I’m Yang Tong, the president of Sky City’s auction house. I’m here to ask you to go back for an investigation. You don’t have to be so malicious.”

“F*ck you! Who do you think you are to ask me to go back for an investigation? Go back and check if you’re your father’s biological son.” Qin Yu cursed without respecting Yang Tong.
