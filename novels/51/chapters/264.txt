Chapter 265: Heading to the Earth Fiend Valley Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

On the way, Qin Yu’s car drove extremely fast.

And the young man beside Qin Yu was so frightened that his face turned pale.

“Bro, I... I don’t know anything. Please spare me...” the young man said with a sheepish smile.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “I won’t do anything to you. As long as you bring me to Yang Zhao’s door, I will let you go.”

“Okay...” the young man hurriedly nodded.

After driving for about half an hour, they finally stopped at the door of a villa.

“Bro, this is the Yang family’s home. Do you see the room with the lights on? That is Yang Zhao’s bedroom.” The young man said eagerly.

Qin Yu nodded. Then, he lightly exerted strength with his feet and his body soared into the air!

“What the...” the young man rubbed his eyes and was dumbstruck.

In the room, Yang Zhao was holding the pill and studying it.

“I wonder how much this thing will be worth if I sell it...” Yang Zhao thought to himself.

“Whatever. I’ll try it first.”

After saying this, Yang Zhao opened his mouth to stuff the pill into his mouth.

At this moment, the window suddenly burst open!

Then, he saw Qin Yu leap out of the window and approach him.

The moment he saw Qin Yu, Yang Zhao was instantly stunned.

“What are you doing here? Get out of here right now. Do you hear me?” Yang Zhao got up from the bed and cursed.

Qin Yu asked coldly, “Where’s Xiao Yu?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Xiao Yu? How would I know!” Yang Zhao cursed angrily.

“Get the h*ll out of here, or I’ll call for help!”

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold. He raised his finger, and a wisp of spiritual energy instantly shot out like a bullet!

“Bang!”

A bloody hole appeared on Yang Zhao’s knee, and both of his knees suddenly kneeled down!

“My leg...” Yang Zhao covered his calf in pain!

“I’ll ask you again. Where’s Xiao Yu? If you don’t tell me, I’ll kill you.” A murderous aura burst out from Qin Yu’s body!

This murderous aura was extremely terrifying, even more intense than the one on that old man’s body!

This made Yang Zhao extremely terrified! His face was deathly pale!

He said in a trembling voice, “You... What do you want to do? Let me tell you, don’t do anything reckless...”

Qin Yu waved his large hand and smacked Yang Zhao onto the ground!

The enormous force made Yang Zhao vomit blood continuously!

“I’ll ask you one last time. Where’s Xiao Yu?!” Qin Yu shouted.

At this time, Yang Zhao was completely frightened to the point of peeing himself. He hurriedly said, “Don’t kill me, Don’t kill me... Xiao Yu was taken away by an old man...”

“Old man?” Qin Yu frowned.

“What exactly happened? Tell me clearly!” Qin Yu shouted angrily.

Yang Zhao told Qin Yu what happened.

“That old man also said that I have to find three virgins for him every month,” Yang Zhao said anxiously.

“Oh right, as a reward, he also gave me a pill!”

Yang Zhao took out the pill from his pocket and held it in his palm.

Qin Yu took the pill and glanced at it. He couldn’t help but be a little surprised.

This pill... was actually filled with spiritual energy?

But now wasn’t the time to pay attention to this. Qin Yu put the pill away and then asked, “Where is that old man?”

“I don’t know either... I don’t even know him...” Yang Zhao said bitterly.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “It seems that you won’t cry until you see the coffin...”

“Don’t. I really don’t know!” Yang Zhao shouted desperately.

“I remember now. He said something about the Earth Fiend Valley... Yes, it’s the Earth Fiend Valley!” In his panic, Yang Zhao remembered what the old man said.

When he heard the words ‘Earth Fiend Valley’, Qin Yu’s expression instantly turned extremely cold!

Even the temperature of the room dropped to the freezing point in an instant!

“The Earth Fiend Valley... still hasn’t changed its ways even after repeated lessons.” Qin Yu took a deep breath and anger flashed in his eyes.

“Bro, I’ve told you everything I know. It really has nothing to do with me...” Yang Zhao said with some fear.

Qin Yu didn’t have the time to pay attention to Yang Zhao. He jumped into the air and jumped out of the window.

After leaving Yang Zhao’s house, Qin Yu drove to Mr. Wu’s house.

When he arrived, Mr. Wu was making calls nonstop to find out which hospital Xiao Yu was in.

As soon as he saw Qin Yu, Mr. Wu rushed over.

He said with some panic, “Qin Yu, where is Xiao Yu? Is there any news?”

Qin Yu nodded. He looked at Mr. Wu and said in a low voice, “Xiao Yu, she...”

“What happened to her? Tell me!” Mr. Wu was so anxious that he was about to cry.

“Xiao Yu was taken away by the people of the Earth Fiend Valley.” Qin Yu sighed.

“The Earth Fiend Valley?” Mr. Wu frowned. “What is the Earth Fiend Valley?”

“It’s an organization in the southwest. They use the dark energy of virgin girls for cultivation.” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Previously, I thought the parasite on Xiao Yu was released by your enemy. Now it seems that the Earth Fiend Valley has already targeted Xiao Yu,” Qin Yu said slowly.

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, Mr. Wu immediately became anxious.

He grabbed Qin Yu’s shoulder and said with tears in his eyes, “I only have one daughter. I can’t lose her. Qin Yu, you must help me think of a way. I can’t lose Xiao Yu...”

As he spoke, Mr. Wu’s tears flowed out.

When he saw Mr. Wu’s attitude, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh to himself.

Parents would always love their children the most, no matter what.

“Mr. Wu, don’t worry. I’ll definitely bring Xiao Yu back safely,” Qin Yu comforted him.

Mr. Wu wiped his tears and said anxiously, “As long as you bring Xiao Yu back, I’ll do whatever you want me to!”

“Mr. Wu, you should rest first. I’ll leave now and head to the southwest,” said Qin Yu.

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and left the Wu family’s home.

He sat in the car as he called Jiang Gu.

At this time, Jiang Gu wasn’t asleep. After receiving Qin Yu’s call, he said in surprise, “Mr. Qin, why are you calling me in the middle of the night?”

Qin Yu said in a sullen voice, “Do you know the location of the Earth Fiend Valley?”

Jiang Gu was stunned and frowned, “Mr. Qin, why are you asking this all of a sudden?”

“I’m going to save someone,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Save someone?” Jiang Gu was even more confused.

“I don’t have time to explain to you now,” Qin Yu said with a frown.

Jiang Gu said in a sullen voice, “I know the location of the Earth Fiend Valley, but... the Earth Fiend Valley is mysterious and unpredictable. Even if an Inner Strength Grandmaster went in, he would probably die...”

Qin Yu let out a deep breath and said, “Okay, I’ll wait for you at the airport.”

Jiang Gu was stunned and said awkwardly, “I have to go too?”

“Who else will lead the way for me?” Qin Yu said.

“I’ll give you half an hour.” After saying that, Qin Yu hung up the phone.

Although Xiao Yu’s accident wasn’t caused by Qin Yu, it had a direct connection.

In other words, Qin Yu wasn’t the root cause, but the direct cause.

Therefore, Qin Yu had to get to the bottom of this matter.
