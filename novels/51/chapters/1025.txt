Chapter 1026: Chapter 1,026, breaking through the Mystic Realm! 

Three Hundred Disciples in black robes followed behind Qin Yu, ready to set off for the Wan family Mystic Realm!

However, Qin Yu didn’t leave. He seemed to be waiting for something.

A few minutes later, a car slowly arrived in front of Qin Yu.

As soon as the car stopped, two people walked out.

They were mystery realm master Li Yu and Zhen Yue, whom they hadn’t seen for a long time.

The moment Zhen Yue saw Qin Yu, a complicated emotion appeared on her snow-white face.

She walked up to Qin Yu as if she had thousands of words to say.

“There’s no need to say it. I know everything.”Qin Yu waved his hand and interrupted Zhen Yue.

“Today is the time for the eternal jade to pay the price.”

The massacre that day left an extremely tragic memory in Zhen Yue’s heart.

Every time she thought of it, she would be terrified.

Qin Yu looked at the crowd and said coldly, “Let’s Go!”

Normally, it would be very difficult to find the mystic realm.

However, it was a pity that the Wan Gu Qiong had once taken Qin Yu to the Wan family Mystic Realm.

At that time, Qin Yu had remembered the location of the Wan family Mystic Realm in his heart.

The actions of hundreds of people naturally attracted the attention of countless people.

In addition, Qin Yu and the others’strange attire made them even more eye-catching.

“Who are these people? Are they shooting a movie?”

“Heaven Gate? What Is That Thing?”

The news quickly spread on the martial arts forum.

“Today, Qin Yu brought over three hundred people and headed northwest!”

“What is he doing? is he going to attack the second secret realm?”

“Impossible. The entrance to the second mystic realm is in Jingdu. It’s not in the northwest at all!”

Busybodies immediately followed behind Qin Yu and the others, secretly recording Qin Yu’s actions.

Qin Yu ignored them. His expression was cold and filled with fighting spirit as he headed straight for the Wan family Mystic Realm.

While passing through the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, Qin Yu brought along the pavilion master.

This action immediately triggered speculation.

“Qin Yu brought along the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion!”

“I seem to have guessed what he’s going to do! Wan clan’s Secret Realm! Wan Gu Qiong!”

“Right, Wan Gu Qiong once killed hundreds of people from the Jade Moon Villa and harassed the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion many times. Qin Yu’s mission this time is definitely heading to the Wan clan’s Secret Realm!”

“Wan clan’s secret realm? That’s a very powerful secret realm. It’s said that their Wan clan was the first to step into the current world, and they were the first to set their eyes on Yan Ruoxue!”

“Hehe, it’s precisely because of this reason that Qin Yu made an attack on the Wan family’s Secret Realm.”

“There’s a good show to watch. I really don’t know if Qin Yu is as powerful as we imagined. Let’s wait and see!”

The crowd moved at an extremely fast speed and headed straight for the Wan family’s secret realm.

They used various means of transportation. After more than four hours, more than three hundred people gathered near the Wan family’s secret realm.

Qin Yu looked at Li Yu and said, “Li Yu, it’s up to you to open the Wan family’s Secret Realm.”

Li Yu nodded and walked to the entrance of the secret realm. He raised his hand and touched the void in front of him.

With Li Yu’s ability, it was not difficult to find this secret realm.

Therefore, after a while, rays of light appeared in front of everyone.

“This is the place,”Li Yu said in a low voice.

After saying that, he began to search for the secret key and used the secret key that he had learned to try to open this secret realm.

It was a long process, but Qin Yu was not in a hurry.

He sat on the peak of the mountain. The gentle breeze blew his long black hair, covering his stern face.

Time passed by minute by minute, and in the blink of an eye, an hour had passed.

“How long will it take?”Qin Yu asked.

A trace of regret flashed across Li Yu’s face.

He withdrew his palm and shook his head. “Qin Yu, I’m sorry. With the secret key in my hand, there’s no way to open this secret realm.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said, “No way to open it?”

“Yes, the secret key in this secret realm has obviously been processed. The Secret Key in my hand is insufficient,”Li Yu said.

“If it’s my master, he might be able to do it.”

“Your master? Jiang Nan?”Qin Yu shook his head.

It was obviously too late to go back and look for Jiang Nan now.

Moreover, with Jiang Nan’s personality, he might not necessarily help Qin Yu.

“I can’t do it at all. Do I have to go back?”Li Yu said with a bitter smile.

Qin Yu stared at the flickering light in front of him, and his eyes couldn’t help but flicker with a cold light.

“Let me try.”Qin Yu walked to the entrance of the mystic realm.

“You? Could it be that you also have control of the secret key?”Li Yu was somewhat surprised.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No, I might be able to violently smash open this mystic realm.”

When these words were said, Li Yu couldn’t help but be greatly shocked.

Violently Smash Open the mystic realm? What kind of method was that?

Even the martial arts association of Jingdu had never tried this method before!

While Li Yu was still in shock, Qin Yu’s fist was already shining with a golden light!

That light was dotted with this somewhat blank color, and it was extremely dazzling under the Green Mountains.

But what was even more attractive was the mountain-splitting and sea-breaking power contained in that fist!

“Boom!”

Qin Yu clenched his fist and threw it at the shining entrance in front of him!

The radiance that appeared on the surface of the entrance was instantly shaken and it was like a stream of air flowing around!

Qin Yu’s expression was ice cold. Without saying a word, he raised his hand and threw another punch!

“If you can’t break me with one punch, then I’ll throw two punches. Sooner or later, there will be a moment when you can’t take it anymore,”Qin Yu said coldly.

He was a man of his words. He threw punch after punch at the entrance!

The stream of air at the entrance was actually diagnosed! The entrance seemed to be loosening! Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Li Yu’s eyes widened and he was dumbfounded!

As a mystic realm master, this was the first time he had seen such an overbearing method!

“This is the ability of a martial saint?”Li Yu swallowed his saliva and whispered.

The pavilion master shook his head and corrected him, “It’s not the ability of a martial saint, it’s Qin Yu’s ability.”
