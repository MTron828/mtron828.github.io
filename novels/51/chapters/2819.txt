Chapter 2820: Repaying Karma

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Fatty Situ stared at Jiang Shengling, seemingly recalling something, and his face suddenly filled with dread.

“This team is formidable. Not only could they quickly recruit many peak power’s top-notch martial artists, but they also managed to snatch resources from the Situ family. This is no ordinary feat.”

While they conversed, the surrounding scenery began to warp.

The ancient ship shot up like a flying sword, its speed astonishing.

The surroundings blurred as they traversed through the mountains.

When faced with impassable terrain, they seamlessly entered the void.

In the blink of an eye, they had traversed thousands of meters.

“What incredible teleportation Dharma Treasures! These would rank high even in the Saint Realm!”

Fatty Situ was somewhat astonished. This speed had already surpassed that of top-notch martial artists he couldn’t defeat in Dao Consciousness.

“And this ship is peculiar. Notice how it sails without any energy fluctuations? It’s as if it’s been crafted into a magical artifact attuned to the power of space.”

Qin Yu pondered for a long time before describing it like this. It felt as if the ship were a master of the Way of Space.

His entire being had almost merged with space itself, and during the journey, he didn’t even need to exert any energy.

“A true relic of the Divine Realm, indeed originating from a wormhole.” Fatty Situ praised.

Qin Yu was also astonished. If this had been a practitioner, he wouldn’t have been as surprised. But at that moment, it was an inanimate object, behaving like a top-notch martial artist.

During the journey, it could sense the folding layers of void.

Then, it traversed space in the most efficient manner possible, which was incredibly frightening.

“The Divine Realm, also known as the Tribulation Seventh Level, what kind of space was it after all?” Qin Yu muttered to himself.

Many unimaginable artifacts in his possession seemed to have come from the Divine Realm’s space.

Including the powers of Heavenly Sin and the Investiture of Gods, they all seemed to have an inextricable connection to this place.

After condensing divinity at the Tribulation Seventh Level, there was only a thin barrier between the Immortal Emperor and Guardian, a cultivation realm his father had once reached.

As Qin Yu pondered, everything in front of him suddenly froze.

Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say it paused, as the ship continued its journey.

Only their immediate surroundings remained still as if the power of time only affected the area they were in.

A hand gently rested on Qin Yu’s shoulder, pulling him out of the time cage.

Qin Yu’s face was filled with horror as, at that moment, another version of himself remained on the ship, sailing along with it.

Meanwhile, his other self found themselves amidst another chaotic current, accompanying someone else.

Qin Yu couldn’t even discern where this place was anymore.

Was it within the void, or a space opened up somewhere?

If the current him was here, then who was the person sitting on the ship?

“This is a parallel space where time flows differently. You are here, and you are there,” the voice explained.

An ethereal figure materialized in front of Qin Yu, and a misty energy slowly took shape before him.

The person standing before him was none other than the monk he had encountered at the Nine Nether Cliff. Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a sense of astonishment upon seeing his clear face.

“Grandmaster!”

Surprisingly, it was the same monk Qin Yu had encountered previously at the Nine Nether Cliff.

Before, relying on one of the two bracelets given by him, the “Start Over” one, Qin Yu had survived under the first kulapati’s hand.

Never did he expect to meet him again here.

“My friend, I hope you’ve been well,” the grandmaster uttered a Buddhist chant, clasping his hands together and slightly bowing.

“Thanks to your bracelet, I survived at the Nine Nether Cliff,” Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

“If it weren’t for your great willpower, even with numerous Dharma Treasures, it’s doubtful one could escape from there,” the monk said before falling silent.

“Grandmaster, what brings you here this time?” Qin Yu asked with a bitter smile.

Since he had inherited the karma of the Buddhist Sect, it was inevitable to repay the karma.

Since he had survived because of this monk, it was only natural to repay the favor. This should also be the reason why he had come to find him.

“Lord, if you happen to encounter a girl named Luo Xueyi at the Divine Silkworm Ridge, please do your best to protect her life. She is of great importance to our Faramita Buddhist Kingdom,” the monk said softly. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Understood, I will exert all my efforts! Grandmaster!” Qin Yu remained composed on the surface, but waves of shock surged within his heart.

How could this monk know his destination? And wasn’t Luo Xueyi the girl he had seen before?

Qin Yu’s bracelet was also translated by her. Wasn’t everything too coincidental?

Qin Yu suddenly had a creepy feeling, as if he were in a scripted scene where everything had been arranged in advance.

Just as he was lost in thought, everything in front of him had already disappeared.

He returned to the ship, where Fatty Situ was still chattering away.

Qin Yu subconsciously glanced at the two bracelets in his hand. He noticed that the sarira on his left hand had somehow turned into six pieces again.

Previously, at the Nine Nether Cliff, he had already consumed five sarira. He didn’t expect the Faramita Monk to replenish them this time.

A chill ran down Qin Yu’s spine. Could it be that this mission wasn’t as simple as he thought?

Suddenly, Qin Yu felt a gaze fall on him.

He looked up and saw Jiang Shengling staring at him with burning eyes, the book in his hand closed.

Could he have discovered the monk’s trail?

Qin Yu felt puzzled. The monk’s method just now was to open up a parallel stream of time.

Could Jiang Shengling have sensed this energy when he met him there?

Qin Yu felt a little uneasy under his gaze but then saw him suddenly stand up.

“Even the Faramita Buddhist Sect has begun to take action…” Qin Yu seemed to hear a sigh.

“Fatty Situ, do you know who Jiang Shengling is?” Qin Yu hurriedly asked as Jiang Shengling left.

“I’m not very sure about the details. This guy is very mysterious, but he wanders around the world of Saints every once in a while and rarely gets involved in various Dharma Treasure competitions. His cultivation path should be righteous qi, which has a very strong restraining power against alien races. However, there is no information about him fighting with others at full strength, so we don’t know how strong he is.” Fatty Situ gathered some information in his mind, but it was still rather vague.

It was impossible to determine this person’s exact strength and stance.

Suddenly, the previously stable ancient ship shook slightly.

Qin Yu could feel that the storm around him had intensified. He had been sailing for ten days now.
