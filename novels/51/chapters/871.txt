Chapter 872: Chapter 872, seizing the nascent soul!

Qin Yu picked up Zhang Yi Jiu and quickly rushed toward the cold palace.

At this time, Zhang Yi Jiu didn’t dare to say anything. She could only take Qin Yu and rush into the cold palace.

The terrain of the cold palace was extremely complicated. At this time, their palace master was cultivating in a frozen secret chamber.

After rushing all the way to the secret chamber, Zhang Yi Jiu pointed inside and said, “The palace master is inside. I Can’t go in with you.”

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude. Through the door, he could clearly see a man sitting cross-legged inside.

The man had waist-length hair, and his body was emitting traces of cold air.

Above his head was a stone that looked like an ice crystal.

The stone was light blue in color. At this moment, streams of aura were surging into the man’s internal Qi.

Qin Yu did not dare to waste any more time. He clenched his fist and suddenly punched the door!

The door immediately shattered with a loud sound. The loud sound shook the entire Han palace and caused it to tremble slightly.

Qin Yu walked quickly to the palace master. When he saw the scene in front of him, his face could not help but be filled with shock.

“This is... the sign of breaking through to the Martial Saint Realm!”Qin Yu could not help but exclaim in shock.

He did not dare to imagine what would have happened if he had come a little later!

Qin Yu held the golden light in his hand and planned to end the life of the palace master with one punch.

However, at this moment, a phantom suddenly appeared above the head of the palace master.

Although it was called a phantom, it had almost materialized! Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

At this moment, the Phantom of the Palace Master looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Who are you?”

Qin Yu said in surprise, “This is... a nascent soul that is about to take shape? You are really going to step into the Martial Saint Realm?”

A martial saint was the nascent soul realm in the cultivation world!

Once one stepped into the nascent soul realm, the golden core would disappear and a nascent soul would be born!

As long as one formed a nascent soul, they could break away from the body!

At that time, even if the body was destroyed countless times, it could still be reborn!

“Who exactly are you? ! You Dare to barge in here? Are you courting death? !”The palace master asked again.

Qin Yu could not help but sneer, “If your nascent soul was really formed, I wouldn’t dare to act Rashly. Unfortunately, this should be the crucial moment for you to shatter your core and form your nascent soul, right?”

The palace master’s expression could not help but change.

Just as Qin Yu had said, upon stepping into the martial saint realm, one must undergo the process of shattering one’s core and forming one’s nascent soul!

And during this process, when one’s golden core was broken and one had yet to successfully form one’s nascent soul, one would be extremely weak! All of one’s cultivation would be exhausted, and one would be no different from an ordinary person!

Therefore, when one became a martial saint, one must have someone to protect them!

“Young man, you and I don’t seem to have any grudges. Why are you stopping me?”The palace master took a deep breath and tried his best to remain calm as he asked.

Qin Yu did not pay any attention to his words. Instead, he rubbed his chin and said, “From your current condition, you will need at most three days to successfully form the nascent soul. By then, you will truly be invincible in the world...”

Qin Yu calculated the time. If he were to enter the martial saint realm in the future, this would happen on the first day after the New Year.

“It seems that their prediction is correct. There will indeed be someone who will step into the Martial Saint Realm after the New Year,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

This could not help but cause Qin Yu to feel a trace of intense pressure.

Since this palace master of the Han Palace was able to step into the martial saint realm, then there must be someone else who was trying to step into the martial saint realm!

And once someone successfully stepped into the Martial Saint Realm, the agreement between the DAO Protectors would cease to exist!

At that time, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association would send out Martial Saints without restraint!

“Young man, I see that you are very talented at such a young age. Why Don’t you join My Cold Palace? I will let you be the Vice Palace Master of the Cold Palace!”The palace master continued to say.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and ignored him.

“If it really doesn’t work, you and I will sit on equal footing. How about it?”The palace master struck while the iron was hot.

“As long as I step into the martial saint realm, no one in the world can stop me! At that time, my cold palace will have whatever it wants!”

“And you will have the same treatment as me! Everything I have will be half of yours!”

Looking at the palace master’s Crazy Attitude, Qin Yu could not help but laugh coldly.

“Is that the ice and snow glazed heart above your head?”Qin Yu asked.

Hearing this, the palace master hurriedly said, “As long as you like it, you can take this ice and snow glazed heart!”

“Hahaha!”Qin Yu could not help but burst into laughter.

“If you really become a martial saint, I’m afraid you’ll kill me immediately, right?”

“No! I swear by the Heavens!”The palace master hurriedly said.

“Stop stalling for time. With your current condition, you’ll need at least three days to successfully become a martial saint.”Qin Yu sneered.

“Do you think you can stall for three days?”

The palace master became even more anxious. He said in a panic, “What do I have to do for you to let me go? No matter what the conditions are, feel free to ask!”

Qin Yu ignored him. He took out his phone and took a picture of this scene.

“Alright, you can report your mission now.”Qin Yu picked up his phone and his face gradually turned cold.

Rays of golden light emitted from his body. The terrifying murderous aura made people feel even more terrified!

After sensing the killing intent from Qin Yu’s body, the palace lord’s expression immediately changed.

“Kid! Are you really going to do this? !”The Palace Lord Roared angrily.

Qin Yu looked at this nascent soul that was about to take shape and grinned. “Not only can I take away the ice and snow glazed heart, but I can also absorb your nascent soul. It seems that there won’t be any problems for me to become a martial saint...”
