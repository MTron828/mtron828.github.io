1801 Glided Rake

The surrounding onlookers’ eyes widened when they saw the natural ore’s skin come off.

“It’s a treasure? Holy sh*t!! Is it a treasure?” the crowd exclaimed.

The Dharma Treasure from such a huge natural ore should be extraordinary!

Jue Wu proudly said, “See? Who is lucky here?”

Qin Yu also frowned.

!!

When he used the desolate divine eye to check, he did not see anything.

“That’s weird.” Qin Yu frowned.

His eyes were also fixed on the natural ore.

Bang! The natural ore’s skin fell off layer by layer, and it finally shattered into pieces!

There was a huge divine weapon, completely black, and nobody could see anything inside. Moreover, there was no aura flowing around it either.

“Could it be that this thing had no color, so the desolate divine eye can’t see through it?” Qin Yu whispered.

The crowd started to discuss, “What is this?” An iron rod?”

“Fu*king iron rod! It’s just a shovel!”

“Jesus Christ! It’s just a fork! An iron fork!”

Jue Wu ignored them, ran over, and held it in her hand.

This divine weapon was huge. It seemed even more giant in Jue Wu’s hands, for it was bigger than her body!

When Jue Wu held it in her hand, the black surface began to fall off again!

Clack! Clack! Clack! People could hear the sound of rust falling off.

Jue Wu’s palm suddenly shook. The black color that wrapped around the divine weapon instantly exploded and shattered, and the golden light burst out from within. They could finally see what was inside!

Seeing the divine weapon, the crowd was shocked!

Qin Yu scratched his head.

This thing was a rake! It looked very much like Zhu Bajie’s Nine-Tooth Spike-Rake, except it was golden.

“It’s Glided Rake!” someone said.

“Glided Rake? This weapon is called Glided Rake?”

“No, it’s golden, so I gave it a name.”

“F*ck off.”

“Glided Rake is a good name. I’ll call it Glided Rake!” Jue Wu said excitedly.

She seemed to like this name and kept waving Glided Rake.

However, Jue Wu’s figure didn’t match this huge Glided Rake.

A small person like her holding such a giant Glided Rake was a hilarious scene.

“Girl, you look funny with this Glided Rake. You’re so small. How are you going to use such a big rake? Why don’t you sell it to me?” a brawny man quickly came forward and asked.

“F*ck you! Who is funny? You are the fu*king funny one here. I like my Gilded Rake, and I’m not selling it!” Jue Wu cursed.

She activated her mind and stored Glided Rake in her spatial God tool.

“I like this thing very much, and I won’t sell it to anyone. Don’t waste your time,” Jue Wu said with her eyes wide open.

The onlookers couldn’t help but laugh as if they thought Jue Wu was a cute kid.

After Jue Wu won the treasure, people started to pay for the natural ores.

They followed Jue Wu, walking forward and patting the natural ores from time to time. Finally, they all chose the largest ones.

“Come on! Let’s go! I can tell there’s nothing good here,” Jue Wu pulled Qin Yu and whispered.

After they walked out of the natural ore shop, Qin Yu said in shock, “It wasn’t just about luck??”

“Fu*king luck! Who would be this lucky? If I told them it wasn’t about luck, they would never let me go.” Jue Wu rolled her eyes. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Then what kind of technique did you use? How did you know there’s a Dharma Treasure inside?”

Jue Wu smiled. “Experience. This is experience. As an experienced foodie, I can tell if there’s anything good in the natural ore.”

Qin Yu was even more confused. He smiled wryly and asked, “Do you always find food in rocks?”

“I told you. You know nothing! Many fierce beasts sealed by the natural ores have the juiciest and finest meat. I will show you next time,” Jue Wu said with an innocent face.

Qin Yu was speechless.

He hadn’t expected such an insane way to find a natural ore with treasure.

After returning to their residence, Jue Wu took out Glided Rake.

She kept caressing Glided Rake like a girl playing with her favorite toy.

“I’ve never had a weapon that I could use. Glided Rake is perfect for me!” Jue Wu said excitedly.

Qin Yu stared at Glided Rake and said in a low voice, “If this thing seriously comes from Forbidden Zone, its power is beyond measure.”

After all, even many True Saints died there, so no one knew how many Dharma Treasures were hidden there.

“Who cares! I like it anyway.” Jue Wu grabbed Glided Rake and swung it forward.

In an instant, an enormous power erupted. After a purple light lingered on Glided Rake and swept away everything in the surroundings, a mountain peak in the distance was smashed into pieces by Jue Wu!

The mountain was far from the two of them, but it was turned into ruins by the strike of the rake. They were both astonished by its overwhelming power!

Qin Yu looked at this scene with a dumbfounded expression. For a moment, he wasn’t sure if it was about Jue Wu or Golden Rake in her hand.

“Perfect! Perfect! I love Glided Rake!” Jue Wu hugged her Glided Rake and rubbed her face on it like a kid.

Qin Yu scratched his head and said in a low voice, “Is she the reincarnation of Zhu Bajie …”

“Zhu Bajie? What are you talking about?” Jue Wu was puzzled.

“Nothing.” Qin Yu shook her head. “When we return to Thunder Courtyard, we can ask the dean where this weapon comes from if we have a chance.”

“Alright,” she said.

…

The next day, Qin Yu and Jue Wu came to the tavern again, waiting for Gu Sanchen.

At noon, Gu Sanchen finally appeared at the door.

Qin Yu quickly walked over, bowed, and said, “Brother Gu.”

“Brother Qin, sorry to keep you waiting,” Gu Sanchen also bowed.

Qin Yu shook his head.”It’s not a big deal. So? Do we have a group now?”

“It’s not going well. Some refuse to go to Forbidden Zone because they are afraid of that place,” Gu Sanchen said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly, and he asked in a hurry, “What about Yang Yu? Is he coming?”

“He said he would come,” Gu Sanchen said.

Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief.

“That’s good! That’s good!” Qin Yu said.

Gu Sanchen raised his eyebrows. “Brother Qin, you seem to be very interested in Yang Yu. Why? Do you know him?”

Qin Yu hid his excitement, for he suddenly realized that he had acted weird.
