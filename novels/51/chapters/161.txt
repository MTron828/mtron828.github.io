Chapter 162: You’re Under Arrest! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Looking at the large clouds gathering in the sky, everyone was stunned by this scene!

Zhou Tong and Luo Jian stared at this strange scene with disbelief in their eyes!

“It’s... It’s really a Danyun...” Zhou Tong muttered softly. He had never seen a real Danyun before!

At this moment, Luo Jian also felt helpless. He instantly understood that he and Qin Yu weren’t on the same level at all!

“Danyun, the legendary Danyun!” The crowd began to become restless.

“I didn’t expect this!”

“Who exactly is Qin Yu? Not only is he capable of defeating a veteran Inner Strength Past Master, but he also has such heaven-defying pill refining techniques...”

“Qin Yu’s future is limitless!”

The condensed Danyun quickly began to slowly dissipate, until it completely disappeared.

The sky returned to normal, as if nothing had happened.

Qin Yu looked at Luo Jian and said indifferently, “Do you still think that you can win?”

Luo Jian forced a laugh inside. All of his pride was completely shattered at this moment.

Just as Luo Jian was about to speak, Zhou Tong suddenly shouted from below the stage, “Wait!”

Everyone’s gazes quickly fell on Zhou Tong.

Zhou Tong gnashed his teeth and said, “Even if you can condense a Danyun, so what?! Who knows whether this pill of yours has powerful effects or not!”

As soon as they heard this, the crowd immediately began to discuss in low voices.

“Yes, if there is no actual effect, even a top-grade pill has no value.”

“Mr. Qin, please explain this pill’s effects.”

“Yes, Mr. Qin, forgive us for being rude, but we really want to know the actual effect of this pill.”

The way everyone addressed him had changed.

From the initial address of “brat” to the later “Qin Yu”, it had now become “Mr. Qin”.

This was enough to prove that they started to respect Qin Yu more and more.

Qin Yu glanced at Zhou Tong, who wasn’t far away, and couldn’t help but sneer. “You still don’t want to give up even now? Alright, then I’ll tell you the effect of this pill.”

“This pill is called the nine dragon pill. Its effect is simple and crude. It can cure any illness, even terminal illnesses.”

“Of course, this medicine also has a weakness. It can’t treat external injuries, and it can only be taken once in a lifetime.”

When they heard this, the audience below the stage immediately became excited!

It could cure incurable diseases? Didn’t that mean that they would have two lives?

Compared to this nine dragon pill, Luo Jian’s Dragon Phoenix Pill instantly became worthless!

“There’s actually such a pill in the world!”

“Mr. Qin, can you sell this pill to me? I’m willing to pay a high price!”

“That’s right, Mr. Qin. No matter how much money it costs, I’m willing to pay!”

When he heard everyone’s shouts, a nonchalant smile appeared on Qin Yu’s face. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I’ll find an opportunity to auction this pill publicly,” said Qin Yu.

Zhou Tong’s expression was extremely ugly!

He couldn’t understand. How could there be such a medicine in the world? It could cure all diseases? This was simply a fantasy!

However, Qin Yu didn’t mind it at all. This medicine was refined from the purest spiritual energy in Qin Yu’s body. Curing diseases was a piece of cake.

Moreover, this nine dragon pill was only a divine medicine in the secular world. In Qin Yu’s inheritance, it was still considered a low-grade pill formula.

There were two reasons why Qin Yu refined the nine dragon pill.

The first reason was that the basket of medicine that Zhou Tong gave him didn’t have any healing effects, so Qin Yu had to rely on his own spiritual energy.

This way, he was unable to refine a pill that was useful to martial artists.

The second reason was that Qin Yu didn’t want to cause trouble.

If he really refined a pill that made martial artists go crazy over it, then there would definitely be countless people eyeing Qin Yu.

At that time, it was very likely that a top-notch martial artist might make a move against him.

“Can we announce the results now?” Qin Yu glanced at the host and said indifferently.

“Um, this...” the host was suddenly in a bit of a dilemma. He looked at Zhou Tong.

Zhou Tong’s expression was ashen, but he didn’t know what to do.

The final judgment was in his hands. But now, all the audience members were impressed by Qin Yu. Even if he wanted to defend Luo Jian, he had to find a good excuse.

The venue fell silent, and countless pairs of eyes were on Zhou Tong.

Zhou Tong gritted his teeth and said, “I think the champion should be Luo Jian.”

Everyone was shocked!

Everyone scoffed at Zhou Tong’s shamelessness.

“No one has seen the effect of Qin Yu’s nine dragon pill. Who knows if it’s real or fake? Are we going to just rely on what he said entirely?” Zhou Tong snorted coldly.

“Hehe, President Zhou, aren’t you being too outrageous?” Someone beside him couldn’t help but say.

“Yeah, you’re being unreasonable.”

Zhou Tong still didn’t mind. He snorted coldly and said, “I’m the President of the Chinese Medicine Association. The decision is in my hands. Whoever I say wins will win!”

“Forget it.” However, at this moment, Luo Jian suddenly shook his head.

“I’m not Qin Yu’s match. Just based on this Danyun, he’s already far superior to me.”

“A loss is a loss. There’s no need to persist,” said Luo Jian.

When he heard Luo Jian’s words, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer. “Zhou Tong, your disciple is more sensible than you.”

Zhou Tong gritted his teeth and berated loudly, “Useless thing! I said that the decision is in my hands. Whoever isn’t convinced should suck it up!”

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Qin Yu really didn’t expect Zhou Tong to be so shameless.

The others couldn’t help but curse inside, but there was nothing they could do.

Zhou Tong snickered. He looked at Qin Yu and said indifferently, “See? This is called power. Sometimes, power is more important than ability.”

“Is that so, Zhou Tong? Do you really think that no one can control you?” At this moment, a voice suddenly came from the door.

After turning around, he saw two men dressed in public office clothes walking in.

Zhou Tong frowned and said, “Who are you guys?”

These two people took out their badges one after another and said, “We’re from the Association. After the higher-ups’ investigation, your status as the president of the Chinese Medicine Association has been revoked. Qin Yu will take your place.”

When he heard this, Zhou Tong’s expression instantly became extremely ugly!

“How... How is that possible?! He’s just a braggart, so what qualifications does he have to be the President?!” Zhou Tong said through gritted teeth.

“This is the decision of the higher-ups. If you’re not satisfied, go find the director yourself!” The other party snorted coldly.

At this time, a few people entered the door.

These people were even more direct. They walked in front of Zhou Tong, took out a document, and said, “Zhou Tong, you’re suspected of many crimes. I now announce that you’re under arrest!”
