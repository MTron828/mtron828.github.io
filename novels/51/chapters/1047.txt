Chapter 1048: Chapter 1,048, the Gu family sent out their troops 

That strand of divine sense returned to the individual’s original body.

However, they still didn’t come back to their senses. Their eyes were somewhat vacant.

“This... what is the origin of this painting? What is the world in the picture?”Qin Yu was the first to come back to his senses.

The Immortal Crane put its hands behind its back and said indifferently, “I don’t know what exactly is the world in the picture, but I know that it is a wider world.”

Having said that, the immortal crane walked in front of Qin Yu and said with a faint smile, “The Yan family that you yearn for is here.”

Qin Yu’s pupils constricted when he heard that!

“What did you say? The Yan family is in this picture?”Qin Yu hurriedly asked.

The Immortal Crane said,”... with your understanding, I suggest that you reforge it.”

Qin Yu hurriedly waved his hand and said, “I was too anxious and confused. Are you saying that the Yan family is in this world? Then where exactly is this world?”

“I don’t know exactly where it is.”Immortal Crane shook its head.

“But I know that in this world, there are many top-notch martial artist families and experts as numerous as the clouds. In this world, the tolerance is stronger. We also don’t need to hide in the demon city,”said immortal crane.

Qin Yu recalled what the higher-ups of the martial arts association in Jingdu had said.

He said that Qin Yu would leave this world sooner or later and head to a wider world.

Not only that, they could also provide conditions for Qin Yu.

At that time, Qin Yu did not think much about it, but now that he thought about it carefully, there seemed to be some other meaning in his words.

“Lord Immortal Crane, what does this have to do with you helping Qin Yu?”Uncle Niu asked with great puzzlement.

Before immortal crane could speak, Qin Yu guessed, “If you want to enter this world, I’m afraid you’ll need to pass through the second Mystic Realm or the first mystic realm, right?”

Surprise flashed in the Crane’s eyes as it said jokingly, “You’re not as stupid as you think.”

“Screw you,”Qin Yu rolled his eyes.

“Qin Yu is right. No one knows where this world is,”the crane said seriously.

“Maybe it’s another planet, or maybe it’s another starfield. With our cultivation, we can’t cross the starry sky, so we can’t figure it out.”

“But the only way I know is to pass through an ancient array platform. That array platform is in the first secret realm.”

“Ancient Array Platform?”Qin Yu touched his chin.

Everyone felt that this name was rather unfamiliar.

The immortal crane nodded and said, “So, if you want to find this array platform, you must pass through the first secret realm.”

“To be honest, before you appeared, I never considered crossing the Void and heading to this world because the martial arts association of Jingdu is too big.”

“But now, I’ve changed my mind.”

Qin Yu also nodded slightly.

He originally wanted to get rid of the martial arts association of Jingdu and the eight high-ranking officials.

After hearing the Immortal Crane’s words, Qin Yu’s conviction was even firmer.

“In that case, if you want to see Yan Ruoxue, you must pass through the first mystic realm...”Qin Yu muttered softly.

The Immortal Crane put its hands behind its back. It bent its slender body and said beside Qin Yu’s ear, “Of course, this is only one of the reasons. I agreed to it because you called me Big Brother.”

“Screw you.”Qin Yu hurriedly jumped a few meters away.

“Hahaha!”Seeing the expression on Qin Yu’s face, the crane could not help but laugh heartily.

Having said that, the crane looked at the crowd and said: “Pass down the order, three days later, to head to the fire country.”

“Yes!”Uncle Niu and the others cupped their hands together, without the slightest bit of doubt.

Qin Yu finally heaved a sigh of relief.

The powers of these demonic beasts were much stronger than those of ordinary human cultivators.

With their help, Qin Yu’s chances of winning would naturally soar.

In the next few days, Uncle Niu personally led a team to pick people, in preparation for the journey to the fire country. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Meanwhile, Qin Yu followed the immortal crane every day, drinking and having fun every day, almost becoming a drunkard.

But it had to be said that the days of being drunk was the most relaxing moment in Qin Yu’s life.

He had almost forgotten his worries, his body and mind in a state of extreme relaxation.

Just as Qin Yu was enjoying himself with wine, something unexpected happened at the Heaven Gate.

In the second secret realm, Gu Zizhen had prepared hundreds of people to attack the Heaven Gate!

Looking at the hundreds of warriors standing in front of him, Gu Zizhen sneered.

“Do you really think my second secret realm is made of mud?”Gu Zizhen said coldly.

“Since you, Qin Yu, have declared war on me, I naturally have the right to attack you, and... I have no scruples!”

At this moment, Zhai Xing walked over.

His condition was still dispirited, and his strength had recovered less than 20% . He looked extremely weak.

“Let me lead the team. Take it as making up for your mistakes...”Zhai Xing said slowly.

Gu Zizhen patted Zhai Xing’s shoulder and said, “You’d better rest well. I’ll send someone else to lead the team for this battle.”

Zhai xing hurriedly said, “I can do it. Just let me lead the team. I promise to complete the mission this time!”

Gu Zizhen sighed slightly and said, “Zhai Xing, do you think you’re still suitable to lead the team in your current physical condition?”

“But... I’m the general of the Second Mystic Realm!”Zhai Xing said in a low voice.

The original intention of his words was to make a contribution to the second mystic realm.

However, to Gu Zizhen’s ears, it sounded like he was protecting his power.

Although Gu Zizhen’s expression did not change much, he was a little unhappy deep down.

“Go and rest well. Chi Hou will lead the team for this battle,”Gu Zizhen said.

As he was speaking, Chi Hou walked over from not far away.

Chi Hou’s position in the second secret area was also quite high. Although he was not as high as Zhai Xing, he was also one of the people that Gu Zizhen trusted the most.

Most importantly, he was also a martial saint! His strength was beyond imagination!

“Lord Zhai Xing, leave this battle to me.”Chi Hou said with a laugh.

Zhai Xing gritted his teeth and said, “Chi Hou, if I didn’t take part in this battle, the injuries would definitely be even more severe!”

These words made the few people extremely displeased.

Gu Zizhen even snorted lightly and said, “What, the second secret realm can’t Do Without You?”

“That’s not what I meant. It’s just that Qin Yu will never show mercy to Chi Hou!”Zhai Xing said hurriedly.

Zhai Xing knew Qin Yu’s strength very well.

Not to mention Chi Hou, even he himself was not Qin Yu’s match!

And the reason why he could come back was because Qin Yu wanted to rope him in!

But if Chi Hou made a move, Qin Yu would definitely go on a killing spree!

It would be fine if he didn’t explain, but the more he explained, the Messier it became.

Gu Zizhen couldn’t help but sneer, “According to what you said, Qin Yu still has some feelings for you?”

“That’s not what I meant...”Zhai Xing wanted to explain, but was interrupted by Gu Zizhen with a wave of his hand.

“Chi Hou, I’ll give you another 500 people, and you lead a thousand people to flatten the Heaven Gate!”Gu Zizhen shouted loudly.

Chi Hou cupped his hands and said, “Please rest assured, master. I promise to complete the mission!”

“Let’s Go!”Gu Zizhen shouted.
