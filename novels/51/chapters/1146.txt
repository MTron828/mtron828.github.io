Chapter 1147: Chapter 1,147, the countermeasures of the higher-ups 

Qin Yu sat upright and upright. This young man, who was known as the number one person in the world, was like a student asking for advice at this moment.

Tian Jizi slowly said, “You have been through a lot of tribulations. According to my calculations, you have two possibilities.”

Qin Yu pricked up his ears, not daring to interrupt.

At this moment, Tian Jizi opened his eyes and swept them towards Qin Yu.

“Either you are doomed, or you have to break the shackles,”Tianjizi said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu frowned and said in confusion, “Please explain, senior.”

Tianjizi closed his eyes and said, “There are some things that you need to understand on your own.”

Although Qin Yu wanted to continue asking, Tianjizi didn’t want to answer, so Qin Yu couldn’t do anything about it.

“Then... senior, what is the possibility of the eternal damnation that you said?”Qin Yu asked.

Tian jizi slowly said, “90% .”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but gasp.

Wasn’t this possibility a little too big?

“Let me give you a word of advice. The man makes the matter. If it is not broken, it will not be established,”Tian Jizi said lightly.

Qin Yu was silent, as if he was thinking about four words.

“Alright, it’s time for you to ask the next question,”Tian Jizi reminded him.

Qin Yu did not dare to waste any more time. He quickly told Tian Jizi his two remaining questions.

One was about his mother’s background, and the other was about the Heavenly Dao punishment of the Dao Protector.

According to the information provided by Tian Jizi, Qin Yu’s mother was not dead, but even he did not know where she was.

As for the punishment of the Guardians of the Dao, Tian Jizi’s answer was also very strange. It was still the same sentence, “The matter is done by man. If it is not broken, it will not be established.”

“Senior Tian Jizi, please interpret this sentence for me.”Qin Yu was somewhat unwilling.

Tian Jizi did not speak, but the two disciples behind him said, “The secrets of the heavens can not be revealed. Master has already told you enough.”

Seeing this, Qin Yu had no choice but to sigh.

He and Tian Jizi cupped their hands, then turned around and walked out of the hall.

“How is it? How is it?”Yao Qing hurriedly walked forward and asked.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “There are some things that you have to rely on yourself to comprehend.”

Man makes the best of things. Qin Yu could understand this sentence, but regarding the latter part of the sentence, Qin Yu did not quite understand.

“Could it be that Tian Jizi wants me to go to the extreme?”Qin Yu touched his chin and muttered softly.

Those who achieved great things would often struggle to survive in the cracks, and they would definitely take an unusual path.

At this moment, Qin Yu still didn’t know that the sentence “If I don’t break, I won’t be established”had greatly helped him in choosing his cultivation path in the future.

Time flew by. By the time everyone had finished asking questions, it was already past eight o’clock in the evening.

“Alright, let’s go,”Yao Meng said.

On the way out, everyone exchanged questions with each other.

For example, when to open the Holy Region, about the eighteen array platforms, and so on.

After asking, they learned that the holy region would open in about a month.

However, what made everyone somewhat regretful was that after the holy region opened, one needed an extremely special material to enter the Holy Region.

This material had already disappeared on earth, so if one wanted to step into the holy region, one had to wait for the extradition of the Holy Region sect.

As for when this extradition meeting would take place, Tianji Zi didn’t say.

After returning to the carriage, Chu Hedao took the initiative to sit together with Qin Yu.

“How is it? Have you found the location of the Sky Blood Rainbow?”Qin Yu asked with a smile.

Chu hedao nodded and said, “Tian Jizi did tell me the location, but... he said that there is more than one inheritor of the Slaughtering Immortal sect, which proves my previous guess.”

“Xiao Yuan?”Qin Yu frowned and asked subconsciously.

Chu hedao said, “I asked Tian Jizi, but he didn’t answer this question, so I’m not sure now.”

Qin Yu touched his chin and said, “Xiao Yuan’s technique is indeed a bit strange, but... He doesn’t look like the inheritor of the immortal slaying sect.”

“Yeah.”Chu Hedao sighed slightly.

“On the surface, Xiao Yuan is very refined and doesn’t compete with the world. There’s really no way to connect him with the evil people of the immortal slaying sect.”

Qin Yu patted the shoulder of the river and said, “We’ll know everything when we find the Sky Blood Rainbow.”

“That’s all we can do.”Chu Hedao nodded.

After returning to the second mystic realm, the group parted for the time being.

Even Tian Jizi didn’t know when someone from the Holy Region would come to extradite them, but at least he knew that the holy region would only officially open a month later.

This one month’s time was just enough for Qin Yu to study the ‘xing’Word formula.

At this moment, in the first secret realm.

Yan Yongfu and the other eight high-ranking officials were gathered together.

“How is it? Have you found that secret technique?”A high-ranking official asked.

Yan Yongfu nodded slightly and said, “I’ve spent all my efforts and finally succeeded in finding this secret technique.”

“Can this secret technique really absorb the power of the eight of us?”A high-ranking official asked doubtfully.

Yan Yongfu snorted lightly and said, “This is a secret technique left behind by our ancestors, so there’s naturally no problem. It’s just that... we need to find someone we can trust, someone who will absolutely obey our orders.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Everyone looked at each other and seemed to think of one person at the same time.

That person was none other than Gu Xinghe.

Ever since Gu Zizhen was beheaded, Gu Xinghe had lost his value.

However, he was not willing to give up. In order to avenge his father, he was willing to work hard for these eight high-ranking officials. He served tea and water every day. He was like a dog raised by eight people, extremely obedient.

“Gu Zizhen has worked for us all his life. It’s only right for his son to sacrifice himself for us.”

“That’s right. Moreover, this Gu Xinghe is filled with hatred towards Qin Yu. He might be the most suitable candidate.”
