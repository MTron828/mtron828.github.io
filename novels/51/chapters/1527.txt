Chapter 1528: Chapter 1,528, Heavenly Tribulation... ! Shattered? ! 1

The furious Sima Bei threw his head back and roared furiously, causing the entire world to tremble.

Even though they were far apart, Zhuo Jing could still feel the powerful killing intent and oppressive feeling coming from his body.

“Not good...”Zhuo Jing thought to himself. This Sima Bei’s internal Qi did not show any signs of weakening. Instead, it became even more powerful!

To Zhuo Jing who was covered in injuries, this was naturally bad news!

“I will definitely tear you into pieces!”Sima bei said coldly.

He took a step forward and walked towards Zhuo Jing.

Zhuo Jing did not want to go head-to-head with him. In his heart, he was very clear that as long as he could delay until Qin Yu’s tribulation was completed, then his mission would be considered complete.

Thus, Zhuo Jing turned around and ran without even thinking!

“You want to run? Do you think you can escape!”Sima bei shouted loudly.

Just as he was about to give chase, another sound came from the sky.

The fifth heavenly tribulation was about to descend.

Qin Yu raised his head and looked at this heavenly tribulation with a hint of solemnity.

“The fifth... come!”Qin Yu grabbed the iron rod and pointed it at the sky, having the spirit of a battle!

......

However, in the next second, Qin Yu’s expression turned ugly.

From the dark clouds, several rays of light slowly emerged. Each ray of light flickered with an extremely dazzling blue color!

“One... two... three... a total of four!”Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically!

Could it be that these four heavenly tribulation were going to descend at the same time? This was simply wanting to kill Qin Yu!

Sima bei, who was about to give chase, was also shocked by the strange scene in the sky and could not help but stop in his tracks.

“Four Heavenly Tribulation descending at the same time?”Sima bei furrowed his brows tightly.

After living for so many years, he had never seen such a scene!

He looked in the direction of Qin Yu and frowned, “Just what kind of monster is this person to actually cause four heavenly tribulation to descend at the same time...”

It was rumored that the more monstrous a genius was, the harsher the conditions for cultivation and the more terrifying the heavenly tribulation would be.

Who knew how many geniuses had died under the heavenly tribulation.

Other than those who had the help of their families, it was as easy as ascending to heaven for a wandering cultivator genius to survive the heavenly tribulation on his own.

Even Sima Bei had never seen a heavenly tribulation like Qin Yu’s.

“Four Heavenly Tribulation. This guy must die,”Sima Bei said coldly.

Not far away, Zhuo Jing also raised his head to look at this strange scene.

“Four heavenly tribulation... it’s too terrifying!”Zhuo Jing muttered in a low voice.

A strange scene appeared in the sky. The dark clouds were like a huge vortex, and the four heavenly tribulation were more like four thick arms that stretched out from the clouds. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely unsightly. He had never thought that the heavenly tribulation would be so vicious!

“Damn it, if you don’t want me to survive the heavenly tribulation, just say it!”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse.

He glanced at the metal rod in his hand and kept it without thinking.

Under these Four Heavenly Tribulation, Qin Yu didn’t dare to take any risks at all.

Even though this metal rod had just saved his life, it still made Qin Yu feel uncertain.

“Oh? He kept the treasure?”Sima bei, who was not far away, could not help but feel a little surprised.

“Could it be that this person has other supreme treasures on him?”

Sima bei was instantly overjoyed. That Iron Rod was already a supreme treasure, yet it had been kept by Qin Yu. This was enough to prove that Qin Yu still had a treasure that far surpassed this iron rod!

As expected, in the next second, Qin Yu directly took out the divine picture.

In his hand, the divine picture still looked extremely ordinary. Holding it lightly in his hand, it was like a piece of useless cowhide paper.

The outline of the scenery on the divine picture was also extremely ordinary and simple. However, through this landscape painting, one seemed to be able to feel a trace of killing intent.

“What is that thing?”Sima bei asked with a frown.

In his opinion, there was nothing strange about this divine picture.

Qin Yu held the divine picture in his hand and couldn’t help but put his palms together.

“Xiao Yu, you have to save me...”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

This divine picture was Xiao Yu’s item. Whether or not it could withstand these four heavenly tribulation, Qin Yu was also uncertain.

But at this stage, he could only give it a try.

Qin Yu held the divine picture in his hand and raised his head to look at the heavenly tribulation.

The heavenly tribulation rumbled, and four thick heavenly tribulation were about to descend at any moment.

A moment later, the four shaky heavenly tribulation began to merge!

The Four Heavenly Tribulation merged into one heavenly tribulation!

At this moment, the heavenly tribulation became even thicker, as if it was going to Pierce through the sky!

“This... What the F * ck is This!”Qin Yu couldn’t help but break out in cold sweat!

Four Heavenly Tribulation merged into one. God knew what kind of power it had!

“It seems that I don’t have to make a move.”Sima bei couldn’t help but sneer when he saw this.

Under such a heavenly tribulation, even he couldn’t withstand it, let alone Qin Yu?

Thinking of this, Sima bei quickly retreated, afraid that he would be affected by the heavenly tribulation.

“Rumble...”

The sky rumbled non-stop. The moment the Four Heavenly Tribulation merged, the entire sky turned dark blue!

“Kacha!”

Along with a deafening sound, the heavenly tribulation descended!

That extremely thick heavenly tribulation instantly submerged everything, tearing the entire space into two halves!

Looking from afar, it was like a waterfall descending from the sky, bringing with it the sound of splashing water as it poured down!

Qin Yu clenched his teeth. He grabbed the divine picture in his hand and waved his hand, welcoming the heavenly tribulation!

“Protect me!”Qin Yu roared in his heart!

The moment he touched the divine picture, it was instantly submerged and disappeared without a trace. There wasn’t even the slightest bit of resistance.

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu’s heart instantly felt like it was dead.

“It’s over...”Qin Yu squatted on the ground.

It was impossible for Qin Yu to withstand such a scale of heavenly tribulation!

“Hahahaha!”Sima bei couldn’t help but laugh out loud when he saw this!

Just when everyone was certain that Qin Yu would definitely die, the Blue Heavenly Tribulation was suddenly pulled back!

In the next second, the heavenly tribulation emitted waves of red light! The divine picture broke through the heavenly tribulation and suddenly appeared!

“HMM? What’s This?”Sima bei couldn’t help but frown when he saw this scene.

At this moment, a jade-like hand actually stretched out from the divine picture!

This jade-like hand stretched out from the divine picture and lightly slapped towards the heavenly tribulation.

“Pa!”

A clear sound spread throughout the five lakes and four seas.

“Boom!”

In the next second, the heavenly tribulation emitted a powerful explosion as if it had been smashed into pieces. The thick heavenly tribulation actually turned into countless rays of light and shot out in all directions!

“It... it was smashed into pieces!”Qin Yu couldn’t help but tremble!

Meanwhile, Sima Bei, who was far away, also widened his eyes!

Heavenly tribulation... it was smashed into pieces?

What kind of short hand was this? How come he had never heard of it before?

“Heavenly tribulation... how could it be smashed into pieces...”Sima bei swallowed his saliva crazily. Because of his shock, his face had almost become distorted!

He had lived for many years, but he had never seen such an overbearing method! Shattering the Heavenly Tribulation, it was unheard of!
