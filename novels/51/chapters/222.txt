Chapter 223: You Didn’t Cherish It Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Jiang Gu suppressed the emotions inside and walked in front of Qin Yu.

“Mr. Qin.” Jiang Gu’s smile was somewhat unnatural.

Qin Yu sized up Jiang Gu and said with a smile. “What’s wrong? You look so pale. Did something happen?”

Jiang Gu was stunned and quickly shook his head. “No... No, I just haven’t been resting well recently.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I’ll give you a pill some other day. I guarantee that you’ll sleep better.”

The more Qin Yu acted like this, the more unnatural Jiang Gu’s expression became.

“Mr. Qin, let’s... let’s go in quickly.” Jiang Gu pulled Qin Yu’s arm and said.

In the living room, the dining table was already filled with delicacies.

“There’s so much food? It just so happens that I haven’t eaten properly for a few days.” Qin Yu sat down excitedly, picked up his chopsticks, and began to wolf down food.

Jiang Gu sat there without saying a word.

He glanced at Qin Yu from time to time, and then looked outside the door.

“Why aren’t you eating?” Qin Yu asked as he stuffed the food into his mouth.

“I... I’m not hungry,” Jiang Gu said with an embarrassed smile.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more.

After he was full, Qin Yu patted his stomach in satisfaction.

He wiped his mouth and said with a half-hearted smile. “Jiang Gu, sometimes a person’s decision can change his whole life.”

When he heard this, Jiang Gu’s expression suddenly changed!

He almost couldn’t hold it in and wanted to tell him about Hui Ming!

But when he thought of his son Jiang Yu, Jiang Gu finally held it in.

“Mr. ... Mr. Qin, I don’t understand what you said...” Jiang Gu braced himself and said.

Qin Yu stretched and said, “Forget it if you don’t understand. Just pretend that I didn’t say anything.”

“By the way, aren’t you looking for me for something? Tell me, what is it?” Qin Yu glanced at Jiang Gu and said with a smile.

Jiang Gu suddenly didn’t know what to do.

His mission was to trick Qin Yu to come here!

As for the specific task, Hui Ming didn’t say anything at all!

“I...”

“Qin Yu, I’m the one looking for you.”

Just when Jiang Gu was at a loss, Hui Ming walked in from outside the door.

Qin Yu looked at Hui Ming and said in surprise. “Tao Shan? Why are you here?”

Hui Ming said with a smile. “Qin Yu, I just joined Jiang Gu recently.”

“Joined Jiang Gu?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

“Aren’t you a member of the Liu Family?” Qin Yu said in surprise.

Hui Ming pretended to be angry and said, “The Liu family is too outrageous. If I follow them, I will never have any future! People should always aim higher.”

When he heard this, Qin Yu touched his chin and didn’t say anything for a long time.

“Qin Yu, I really didn’t expect you to develop to such a level in such a short time. Even Jiang Gu lost to you.”

Hui Ming walked to Qin Yu and sat down while saying with some enthusiasm.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “You aren’t bad. You have successfully broken through to the Grandmaster realm. You should celebrate.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Hui Ming laughed out loud and said, “Compared to your achievements, it’s not worth mentioning!”

Following that, Hui Ming poured a cup of wine for Qin Yu and said with a smile. “Come, in order to celebrate you becoming the King of Chuzhou, I’ll toast you!”

Qin Yu didn’t refuse. He raised his wine cup and clinked it with Hui Ming, then emptied it in one go.

Qin Yu, who was already full, drank a few more cups of wine with Hui Ming.

During this time, Jiang Gu sat on the side without saying anything or eating.

“Qin Yu, I’m a little thirsty. Can you help me get some water?” Hui Ming suddenly said with a smile.

“No problem.” Qin Yu turned around and walked towards the kettle without thinking.

However, the moment Qin Yu turned his back on Hui Ming, a vicious glint flashed in Hui Ming’s eyes!

His fingers flashed with light, and with a swoosh, he grabbed at Qin Yu!

Under the cover of his inner strength, Hui Ming’s fingers were sharper than daggers, and they were extremely fast!

Even steel could be penetrated in an instant!

Therefore, Hui Ming was fully confident that he could kill Qin Yu in one strike!

“Huh? Why is my shoelace untied?” However, at this moment, Qin Yu suddenly squatted down.

Hui Ming’s finger brushed past Qin Yu’s body!

“F * ck!” Hui Ming immediately cursed inside!

Qin Yu was really lucky!

He looked coldly at Qin Yu, who was squatting on the ground, and extended his finger for the second time!

“That one is also untied. How annoying.” However, Qin Yu’s body tilted slightly again and he just happened to dodge this fatal blow.

This made Hui Ming’s expression turn extremely ugly! He was so exasperated that he almost flew into a rage!

“I don’t believe that your luck will always be this good!” Hui Ming couldn’t contain his anger and extended both of his hands at the same time!

“Jiang Gu, as the host, you should go and get some water.” However, Qin Yu turned around at this time and once again dodged Hui Ming’s attack!

“How is this possible?!” Hui Ming was going crazy!

He suddenly had a bad feeling!

A person could be lucky once or twice, but it was impossible to dodge every time!

Just when Hui Ming was shocked, Qin Yu suddenly turned around.

He sighed slightly. “I have already given you three chances to kill me, so why didn’t you cherish it?”
