1751 Jue Wu Takes Action

In the face of this gigantic ax, Wen Wanchong did not dare to take it head-on. He hurriedly took out Qin Yu’s iron rod, clenched it with both hands, and tried his best to meet it.

Clang! Clang!

The terrifying force sent the iron rod flying, and half of Wen Wanchong’s body was smashed into the ground!

“Not good!”

Seeing this, Wen Wanchong’s expression changed!

He tried to get up, but it was too late. Yuan Xiu’s second slash had already come down!

Wen Wanchong’s face turned pale. It was impossible to escape now!

“Whoosh!”

At this moment, a bamboo leaf-like radiance welcomed the gigantic ax!

Even though the light didn’t stop the gigantic ax, it still bought time for Wen Wanchong.

He took advantage of this opportunity to escape to the side and grabbed the iron rod again.

“Boom!”

The gigantic ax smashed into the ground, shattering large pieces of space!

Wen Wanchong’s face was extremely pale. If the ax landed on his body, he would be smashed into meat paste!

“How is it?” Qu Zhu looked at Wen Wanchong.

“No,” Wen Wanchong shook his head. “This Yuan Xiu is too scary. He wants to kill us as soon as possible.”

“We should be prepared to die before coming.” Qu Zhu took a deep breath.

Even though this was not in line with his life’s creed, he still came.

“You two reckless fools. You’re not my target. You’d better get lost immediately!” Yuan Xiu said coldly.

After saying this, Yuan Xiu once again charged at Xiao Sheng.

“Not good!” Wen Wanchong’s expression changed, and he immediately looked at Qu Zhu!

The two of them looked at each other and immediately attacked at the same time!

Red and green chains emerged from their palms. They pierced through the void and bound Yuan Xiu in place!

Yuan Xiu’s face turned cold. He tried to move forward but found that the force was too strong and he could not move.

“Seize this opportunity and kill him!” Wen Wanchong gritted his teeth and took out a drop of blood essence. Then he put his hands together, as if he was going to cast some terrible spell.

“Boom!”

After a loud bang, a giant appeared behind Wen Wanchong!

The giant had a ferocious face and bared its fangs. Its entire body was blood-red!

“Vision?” Yuan Xiu turned around to look at the giant and sneered.

“What kind of vision are you playing in front of me? Is there any use?” Yuan Xiu’s expression was frighteningly cold.

He squinted his eyes slightly, and a black aura emanated from his body. In the next second, the entire world was invaded by this black aura, and they seemed to have entered another world!

Immediately after, Yuan Xiu clasped his hands together and rays of light flew out from between his eyebrows!

The light gathered on his back and finally formed a huge figure!

This seemed to be an ancient figure, extremely terrifying. A cold aura spread out, and a single gaze seemed to be able to penetrate through the ages!

Wen Wanchong did not show any fear. After he shouted, the strange phenomenon rushed towards Yuan Xiu!

However, in the face of such a terrifying ancient existence, Wen Wanchong’s vision was no match for it. The moment they collided, the vision was crushed into pieces!

Wen Wanchong’s face turned pale, and he staggered back a few steps, spitting out a mouthful of blood! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“This won’t do. I don’t know what kind of supernatural power Yuan Xiu is using. He seems to be able to mobilize the Immortal Slaying Sect’s Mighty Realm force!” Wen Wanchong could not help but clench his teeth.

Qu Zhu was well aware of how terrifying Yuan Xiu was. The entire space seemed to be enveloped by them.

“That’s the only way.” Qu Zhu said coldly.

He opened his mouth slightly, and a dark green aura followed.

This aura was extremely pure, so pure that no one could tell what it was.

His aura was circulating rapidly, and in a flash, it condensed into a huge bamboo leaf.

“What is this?” Wen Wanchong frowned.

Qu Zhu looked at Wen Wanchong and said coldly, “This is the power of the origin I obtained at Fengzhu Mountain.

The power of the origin was born from chaos, and it was an extremely terrifying thing. Qu Zhu had always relied on this power of the origin to cultivate.

He was forced to use it now.

“Power of the origin…” Wen Wanchong’s brain was spinning rapidly, and his face was dripping with sweat. He seemed to be thinking about something.

“Dayue Mountain is the former residence of a great cultivator undergoing the heavenly tribulation. Why can’t I find his power of the origin…” Wen Wanchong gritted his teeth.

If he could obtain Dayue Mountain’s power of the origin, he would not have been in such a difficult position in this battle!

At this moment, the power of the origin was already crushing towards Yuan Xiu. Yuan Xiu snorted coldly and the terrifying existence behind him immediately raised its palm to meet the attack.

“Boom!”

This was an extremely terrifying collision, shattering everything.

Mysterious lines appeared on the mysterious bamboo leaf. This was the power of the origin that was being emitted!

With a loud bang, the pitch-black world was pierced through, and the terrifying existence behind Yuan Xiu disappeared!

“Thump, thump, thump!”

Yuan Xiu was forced to take a few steps back and his face turned red.

This undoubtedly infuriated Yuan Xiu. He glared at Qu Zhu coldly and gritted his teeth. “You’ve stopped me time and time again, ruining my plans. Today, I’ll definitely kill you two ants!”

Yuan Xiu looked at Sima Bei and the others and shouted, “You guys go and kill Xiao Sheng. I’m going to kill these two bastards!”

“Alright!” Sima Bei was overjoyed. This was the chance he had been waiting for!

The two of them quickly made their way towards Xiao Sheng. To them, it was a great honor to be able to kill such a figure!

“Not good!” Wen Wanchong’s expression changed!

Ignoring the injuries on his body, he gritted his teeth and charged in Xiao Sheng’s direction.

However, he had only taken two steps when the space around him collapsed!

All the space collapsed like fragments and soon began to reform.

In a short moment, Wen Wanchong and Qu Zhu were trapped in a separate space.

This was Yuan Xiu’s spatial secret technique, which trapped the two of them in this small space, unable to escape!

“Take care of yourselves first.” Yuan Xiu said coldly.

Wen Wanchong’s face was extremely unsightly. He couldn’t help but look in Xiao Sheng’s direction with a trace of worry on his face.

“Something major has happened.” Qu Zhu, who was standing to the side, also took a deep breath.

In Nanzhou, only Xiao Sheng, who had reached the Reversion Void Stage, could fight him.

As for Yong Ji and Sima Bei, they had already walked up to Xiao Sheng.

“Go to hell, Xiao Sheng!” Sima Bei’s face was filled with madness as he raised his hand and charged towards Xiao Sheng!

However, at this moment, a petite figure appeared in front of Xiao Sheng. Her palm was glowing with a purple light, and she blocked Sima Bei’s attack!

“Yong Ji, you bastard, long time no see!”
