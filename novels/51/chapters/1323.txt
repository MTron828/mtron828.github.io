Chapter 1324: Chapter 1,324, encountering a mysterious creature again! 

Ah San pulled Wan ‘er and hurriedly retreated, afraid that he would be smashed by this body.

“What’s going on?”Ah San asked with a frown.

After the figure fell, another thin figure appeared in front of them.

This person was none other than Qin Yu.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s body was covered in blood, and even his face was covered in scars.

However, his face was still as resolute as a knife.

“Qin... Qin Yu?”Wan ‘er called out tentatively.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “It’s okay.”

Wan ‘er immediately broke free from Ah San and threw herself into Qin Yu’s arms.

“I thought you were dead...”Wan ‘er said in panic.

Qin Yu was a little embarrassed. He gently pushed Wan ‘er away and said, “My body is covered in blood. Stay away from me.”

Ah San, who was at the side, had an extremely ugly expression.

He clenched his fists and looked at Qin Yu with a face full of anger.

“What kind of magic artifact do you have on You?”Ah San walked forward and shouted loudly.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “What kind of magic artifact?”

“Without a magic artifact, how can you be a match for that thing!”Ah San said coldly.

Qin Yu frowned and sneered, “AH SAN, I can understand if you are jealous, but I just saved your life. It’s fine if you don’t thank me, but you still hurled hurtful words at me. has your conscience been eaten by a dog?”

Ah San braced himself and said, “I didn’t ask you to save him. You should have stayed by Miss Wan ‘Er’s side to protect him!”

“Idiot.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse.

This AH San was purely licking a dog, trying to rely on his so-called gentleness to capture Wan ‘Er’s heart.

Little did he know that the more he acted like this, the less likely it was for him to get Wan ‘Er.

Because when a man grovels, he would lose all his charm.

“Miss Wan ‘er, you follow behind me. I don’t know when that thing will appear again,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Wan ‘er hurriedly nodded. She followed beside Qin Yu, extremely docile.

“And you, don’t F * cking show off. If you die, no one will care about you,”Qin Yu said with a dark face.

AH SAN snorted lightly, “Aren’t you just relying on your magical artifact? It’s nothing impressive.”

Qin Yu was too lazy to explain to him. He just strode forward.

“Young Master Qin, what exactly is that thing? It looks so huge,”wan ‘er asked from behind.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment and said, “I don’t know what exactly it is. In short, it looks extremely terrifying. Its entire body is dark green. It doesn’t look like a creature from this world.”

“Hehe, you really dare to say that just to show off,”ah San behind him could not help but mock. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“That creature’s entire body is covered in fog, so it’s impossible to see clearly. How do you know that it looks terrifying?”

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “I’m not as vain as you. The reason I can see it is because I have the desolate divine eye.”

“Hehe, Miss Wan ‘er, do you believe it? In any case, I don’t believe it,”Ah San snorted.

Wan ‘er said softly, “I think Young Master Qin probably won’t lie...”

AH SAN’s expression changed slightly. He said unwillingly, “Miss Wan ‘er, don’t be deceived by him! He isn’t a strong person at all. The reason why he can defeat that strange thing is because of the magic artifact on him!”

Qin Yu was a little impatient because of this AH San.

He stopped and turned to look at Ah San. He said, “If I didn’t rely on the magic artifact, then you should shut your mouth, okay?”

Ah San sneered. “Okay, but if you rely on the magic artifact, then you must admit that you’re a despicable person!”

“Okay, it’s a deal.”Qin Yu nodded.

He ignored ah San and Strode forward.

The purpose of this trip was to find the life force, not to prove himself.

Ah San stared coldly at Qin Yu’s back and roared in his heart, “When we meet that thing later, I’ll see how you can pretend!”

This place was extremely huge. The deeper they went, the more powerful the mysterious creature became.

Ah San was sure that they would meet more creatures in the future.

Qin Yu had the same thought, but he was more focused on searching for the Qi of life.

Qin Yu had seen the shape of the Qi of life before. It was a light green aura, which was in stark contrast to the white internal Qi around them.

With Qin Yu controlling the desolate divine eye, it was not difficult to find the Qi of life.

The three of them walked for a long time before a mysterious creature blocked their path.

That huge body was like a small mountain, making it difficult for them to breathe.

Seeing so for myself, who had seen the mysterious creature’s abilities, his legs went weak and he felt fear in his heart.

“Qin Yu, didn’t you say that you didn’t use a Dharma artifact? Kill him!”Ah San immediately threw it at Qin Yu’s head.

“AH SAN!”Wan ‘er immediately frowned.

She grabbed Qin Yu and said softly, “Young Master Qin, don’t try to be brave.”

Qin Yu sneered, “I, Qin Yu, always keep my words.”

After saying that, he raised his head and looked at this creature.

This place was already much deeper than before, so Qin Yu guessed that this creature was probably even more powerful than before.

Qin Yu did not waste any words. He directly opened the third level of the fighting word formula, and then took the initiative to attack!

He held divine power in his hand, and instantly arrived in front of this creature. His fist was directly aimed at his head!
