2172 Jue Wu Makes Her Move

This internal qi gave him an unprecedented sense of power, making him feel he had transformed into an ancient ferocious wild beast.

“This internal qi is simply tailor-made for me. Or rather… It was born for the chaotic body!” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Although cultivating here would cause one to suffer a great deal of pain, it could also temper one’s temperament. This was true cultivation!

As long as he stepped into the True Saint Realm here, he could have a chance of escaping!

Qin Yu did not waste any more time. He immediately closed his eyes and began to absorb the chaotic qi here with all his might.

There was nothing here except nothingness, which made cultivation even purer.

…

At the Yao family, it was nighttime, and the surroundings were silent.

Under the shroud of darkness, the Yao family was adorned with starlight, resembling a dreamlike fairyland. Moonlight spilled into the courtyard, casting a faint ethereal glow over everything.

As no one was guarding this place, it was exceptionally quiet.

At this moment, a small figure appeared in the sky above the Yao family.

The small figure seemed to have blended into the tranquility of the night, floating lightly in the air like a feather.

It was a young girl dressed in a pure white gown, her hair cascading down to her waist like a waterfall. As a gentle breeze passed by, it gently lifted her hair.

But the girl, as quiet as an angel, coldness filled her body at this moment. It was tremendously terrifying!

She was non-other than Jue Wu!

Her entire body exuded a chilling aura of murderous intent at this moment. She slowly raised her hands. In an instant, a sun seemed to have appeared in the sky, illuminating the originally dark Yao family. That ray of light shot through the sky, instantly turning the night into day in an instant!

Jue Wu’s hands were dragging an extremely bright light. She raised her hands, and a terrifying internal qi continuously swept out in all directions!

It was Jue Wu’s trump card technique, the Heavenly Flower of All!

It was a technique of indiscriminate attack. Once unleashed, it will cause countless deaths and injuries!

Countless rays of light bloomed in the air like dazzling flowers, each exuding tremendous energy fluctuations. They were graceful and swift, like thousands of flowers blooming, beautiful yet terrifying.

Icy coldness filled Jue Wu’s gaze, and the splendid radiance quickly woke the Yao family members, who were sleeping, up!

“What’s that? It’s so glaring!”

“Where did this light come from? It actually bloomed in the sky above my Yao family!”

“Something’s not right. There’s a murderous aura. What a terrifying murderous aura!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

In the instant when someone realized what happened, Jue Wu raised her hand, harnessing the radiance, and ruthlessly covered the Yao family beneath!

Traces of purple contained within the light, intensifying its terrifying power!

It was the terrifying power of fusing with the purple cloud pearl. It was even more potent than previously!

Jue Wu’s Heavenly Flower of All enveloped the entire Yao family. Dazzling light bloomed in the air as if beautiful blooms of flowers.

In this instant, the cultivators in the Yao family felt the threat of death. They erupted in cries of terror, trying to evade this terrifying attack.

However, the power of the Heavenly Flower of All was omnipresent. Regardless it was in the air or on the ground, no cultivator could escape the range of this indiscriminate attack.

The cultivators, touched by the rays of the light, let out piercing screams of agony. Their bodies were instantly annihilated and reduced to ashes. Blood, flesh shattered flesh in fragments, and shattered bones permeated the air, creating a horrifying scene.

The scene in the courtyard also underwent a tremendous change. The internal qi of death and destruction filled the once peaceful and beautiful fairyland. The light instantly destroyed the meticulously trimmed flowers, plants, and trees, turning them into scattering ashes. Petals, leaves, and branches swayed wildly in the air, reflecting the dazzling brilliance yet revealing a desolate beauty.

Jue Wu’s gaze was cold and ruthless. She stood in the sky, and there was no expression on her face watching everything beneath being destroyed. The radiance in her hand grew increasingly intense along with more intense energy fluctuations.

The Yao family’s cultivators were helpless in the face of Jue Wu’s Heavenly Flower of All. They were completely suppressed and could not resist this destructive power. Some cultivators tried to use their spells to defy, but their efforts seemed insignificant and could not change the situation at all.

The cultivators fell to the ground one after another. Their lives were taken away by the Heavenly Flower of All. Their bodies shattered in the light, and blood gushed out. Their souls also dissipated, unable to escape this territory of death.

The entire Yao family was in an atmosphere of deadly silence and fear.

The cultivators cried out in pain, and despair filled their faces. They were powerless to turn the situation around and could only wait for death to arrive.

Jue Wu’s gaze was like ice. She looked at the miserable state of the Yao family without any pity. The light in her hand instantly exploded, forming a massive light beam as if the god of destruction had descended.

Under the light beam, the entire landscape of the Yao family began to distort and crumble as if the world was on the verge of collapsing. The remaining buildings collapsed one after another, the ground trembled, and everything in the courtyard disappeared without a trace.

“How dare you destroy my Yao family!” The elders of the Yao family finally stood up. Several True Saints suddenly attacked, unleashing powerful forces to counterattack Jue Wu. Their figures flickered and transformed into flowing light, swaying in the air, colliding with Jue Wu’s radiance.

In an instant, the internal qi between heaven and earth became extremely tense, and intense energy fluctuations filled the air. The elders of the Yao family used all kinds of powerful spells and supernatural powers. Their bodies exuded an intense celestial aura as if they had transformed into gods.

Jue Wu gazed at everything coldly. She did not avoid and instead received the counterattack of the Yao family’s elders with a steadfast gaze.

When the two powerful forces collided, the space instantly collapsed, stirring up a terrifying wave of energy. Flames, thunder, frost, sword aura, and various elements intertwined, creating a spectacular yet perilous spectacle.

Explosions and thunderclaps echoed in the sky above the Yao family. The entire scene fell into chaos and destruction. Countless energy fluctuations intertwined, causing intense spatial vibrations and the surrounding scenery to collapse in an instant.

“You bunch of d*mned b*stards, go to hell!” Madness filled Jue Wu’s face, and she attacked again. The pure true energy gushed from her small hands without reservation!

Obviously, Jue Wu came intending to destroy the Yao family!

However, this was the Yao family, one of the nine great aristocratic families. They had many True Saints, countless treasures, and formations!

After the elders of the Yao family made their moves, the entire Yao family was instantly enveloped and wrapped in radiant lights, completely isolating all of Jue Wu’s techniques from reaching them!

“You dare to attack the Yao family? You’re courting death!” A Supreme Elder of the Yao family stepped forward and arrived before Jue Wu almost instantly!

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Immediately after, three more True Saints followed closely behind and surrounded Jue Wu!
