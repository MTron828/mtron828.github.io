1910 The Third Princess of the Yan Family

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded and didn’t ask further.

“In other words, I’ll have to stay long in Xihinag Island?” Qin Yu asked.

“That’s right. But don’t be too depressed. The Yan family will give you more herbs because of the harsh environment on the island. You can even state your conditions. As long as it’s not too much, the Yan family will agree,” the cultivator said.

Qin Yu nodded repeatedly.

!!

It seemed that the Yan family treated their people well. They were only harsh to outsiders.

“Alright. I’ve sent you off here. You’re on your own now.” The cultivator waved his hand and quickly left the place without looking back.

After he left, Qin Yu did not waste time and immediately set foot on Xihuang Island.

Just as the cultivator had said, Xihuang Island was a barren land. There was nothing but rocks.

The surroundings were empty and pitch black, and a sense of loneliness suddenly hit him.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and spread his hands, feeling the dark energy around him.

The dark energy here was quite dense. It was an ideal place to cultivate.

To others, this place was hell. But to Qin Yu, it was like heaven.

Qin Yu was no longer afraid of the so-called loneliness. He had been used to being alone since he was a child.

As for the third princess, Qin Yu was not worried at all.

She was just a little girl. Even if she was a pervert, how perverted could she be?

“When an opportunity arises, I have to think of a way to meet Yan Ruoxue,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Originally, Qin Yu’s intention of stepping into the Yan family was only to see Yan Ruoxue. But now, things were different. On Xihuang Island, Qin Yu could cultivate here.

Qin Yu closed his eyes and began to absorb the dark energy from the surroundings.

Wisps of dark energy filled Qin Yu’s body endlessly, almost without any consumption.

From time to time, a loud noise would come from the floating palace not far away. Sometimes, it was like holding a party. And sometimes, a wave of beast-like roars would burst out.

However, all of these were filtered automatically by Qin Yu’s ears. His mind was calm as if he had integrated into Great Dao.

Qin Yu was in a state of cultivation for three days.

When he opened his eyes and felt the dark energy around him again, he was surprised to find it not diminishing at all!

“What exactly is this Xihuang Island suppressing? The dark energy is so terrifying.” Qin Yu frowned slightly in surprise!

In Golden Age, most of the dark energy had been devoured. It was rare to see such an extent of dark energy except for the Big Graves of Immortal Emperor or the sanctums of the Tribulation Stage great cultivators.

“Could it be that an Immortal Emperor was suppressed underneath this island? Or a Tribulation Stage great cultivator?” Qin Yu thought to himself.

In that case, it would be too terrifying!

“Forget it. Let’s not care about that. Instead of letting Si Shiyue take advantage, I’d better do it,” Qin Yu muttered.

He closed his eyes and planned to continue cultivating.

At this moment, a series of terrifying sounds erupted from the palace not far away!

Thick smoke came out of the palace, and the palace began to collapse!

“Hmm?” Qin Yu frowned and stood up in a hurry. He then looked in the direction of the palace.

At this moment, dozens of people shot out from the palace and headed straight toward Xihuang Island!

Their internal qi was incredibly dense, and all of them formed a circle. A young girl was in the circle.

This young girl dressed up in a very pretty and cute manner. The anger and unruly expression on her face did not match her appearance.

The group of people headed straight toward Xihuang Island. They landed on Xihuang Island in a short while.

Qin Yu frowned. He glanced at the girl and said softly, “If I’m not wrong, that girl must be the third princess of the Yan family.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

She was surrounded by cultivators. Looking closely, there were even three Semi-Saints with her.

“The Semi-Saint is easily available as expected of the Yan family,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He didn’t pay any attention to these people. He just sat crossed-leg on the ground with his eyes slightly closed.

“D*mn it! This broken palace!” The third princess cursed. She held the light in her hand and blasted it in the direction of the palace.

Under the rays of light, the palace was reduced to ruins.

“Hurry up and get me a new one!” The third princess yelled.

“Yes, Third Princess.” The people around her didn’t dare to say much and quickly agreed.

“Eh? Is there a newcomer to Xihuang Island?”

Soon, the third princess noticed Qin Yu, who was sitting cross-legged.

With a stomp of her feet, she swiftly arrived in front of Qin Yu. The bunch of people around her did not dare to delay and hurriedly followed her.

The third princess half bent her body and carefully sized up Qin Yu. Her eyes were full of curiosity.

“Pfft!”

The next second, the third princess burst into laughter.

“Look! There’s an ugly monster here this time. Oh my God! He’s too ugly!” The third princess held her stomach and laughed wildly.

The people around her didn’t dare to say anything and could only laugh dryly.

“F*ck! I think you’re courting death!”

The third princess, who was still laughing a second ago, suddenly hit a cultivator with a strike!

...

This strike directly shattered his cheekbone, and blood gushed out.

“Are you pretending to laugh? Fine, then I’ll make you as ugly as he is!” The third princess did not care about his pain. She reached out and crazily rubbed his face, completely crushing his bones!

Even Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown at such a cruel method.

“Mmm… It looks like he’s uglier,” the third princess said to herself while rubbing her chin.

She then turned around, looked at Qin Yu, and muttered, “Hey, why are you so ugly? How do you grow? Did you not evolve well?”

Qin Yu didn’t get angry with her but smiled and said, “I was born with it, but I don’t think it’s a big deal to look ugly. It’s even scarier to have an ugly heart.”

“What ugly heart? Hurry up and open his chest for me to see!” the third princess said excitedly.

Qin Yu frowned. He stood up, bowed, and said, “Greetings, Third Princess. If you want to see how ugly a heart is, I suggest you open your chest.

“How audacious! How dare you disrespect Third Princess!” The third princess’s people immediately rushed over and surrounded Qin Yu!

The third princess came to her senses. She looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “You ugly thing! How dare you scold me!”

“No, I don’t,” Qin Yu said as he bowed.

...

“Why don’t I do some plastic surgery for you?” the third princess squinted her eyes and said. “Your face is really disgusting.”

After saying that, the third princess walked up to Qin Yu. Her palm emitted a terrifying radiance, and she aimed it straight at Qin Yu’s face!

“Boom!”

The radiance hit on Qin Yu’s face hard, and blood spurted out!
