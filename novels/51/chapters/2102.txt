2103 Three Golden Lotuses

The person Jue Wu was talking about was naturally Xiao Sheng and his Rashomon. However, Xiao Sheng was not famous in Zhongzhou, so no one had seen him use Rashomon.

Looking at the Chaotic Black Hole in Yao Xi’s hand, Qin Yu’s eye expression became increasingly determined.

Back then, Xiao Sheng’s Rashomon was also said not to be cracked. However, it was successfully cracked by Zhao Jing in the end.

Now, Qin Yu’s mind was constantly showing the moves that Zhao Jing had used, and he slowly raised his palm.

“Qin Yu, stop pretending. No one can escape from the Chaotic Black Hole,” Yao Xi said coldly while holding the black hole.

Qin Yu ignored Yao Xi and just looked on coldly.

“You’re courting death.” Yao Xi’s voice turned cold. Then he raised his head and shouted. The shadow on the Emperor Shadow Technique was constantly surging, and Yao Xi’s arm was constantly trembling!

“Go to hell!”

Following Yao Xi’s explosive roar, the chaotic space in his hand was thrown toward Qin Yu!

“Rumble…”

A terrifying roar resounded, and the black space emitted incredibly strange light!

Qin Yu’s pupils constricted. Following that, his hands slid in the air, and his fingertips emitted specks of golden halo.

The halo slowly formed a circle in the void. Then, Qin Yu’s hands shook, and the circle pushed toward the Chaotic Black Hole!

“Boom!”

Finally, under everyone’s watchful eyes, the golden halo swiftly collided with the Chaotic Black Hole, creating a violent collision!

Before anyone could exclaim, the golden halo was swallowed by the Chaotic Black Hole!

“Hmm? Just this?” For a moment, everyone was puzzled!

From Qin Yu’s expression, he thought he could easily deal with the Chaotic Black Hole, but now, it did not even cause a ripple!

“You’re courting death.” Seeing this, Yao Xi could not help but sneer.

However, his smile did not even last for half a second before his expression slightly changed.

With a thought, a drop of blood essence flew out from Qin Yu’s glabella and soon entered the black hole!

“Buzz!”

Golden Light suddenly appeared, almost illuminating the entire black hole!

“What’s that? Golden light!”

“Wasn’t that Golden Light devoured just now? Why did it reappear now?”

“Could it be…”

Soon some people at the scene guessed Qin Yu’s thoughts, while Holy Son Jiang narrowed his eyes slightly as if he had guessed Qin Yu’s thoughts.

“Could it be that he wants to blow up the Chaotic Black Hole?” Holy Son Jiang whispered.

“This Chaotic Black Hole is said to be able to swallow everything,” Saintess Gu said with a smile. “It’s unlikely that it will explode from the inside.”

But just as she finished speaking, the words that reached the tip of her tongue suddenly stopped.

In the Chaos Black Hole, the golden light became even more dazzling. As Qin Yu’s second drop of blood essence entered, the golden light instantly became even more dazzling. A force filled with destruction and calamity was continuously surging.

Qin Yu’s looked calm as his fingers slid rapidly in the air as if he was drawing some kind of complicated runes. Every drop of blood essence was infused with immense power as it filled the golden halo that was being devoured by the black hole.

He knew well that this was his only chance. If he failed, he would be swallowed by the Chaotic Black Hole permanently and disappear from this world.

The golden light grew increasingly stronger in the Chaotic Black Hole. The powerful force caused the surrounding space to begin to fluctuate subtly.

“What is it? This…” Yao Xi’s expression changed drastically. He could feel the power within the Chaotic Black Hole was continuously increasing. It was a power that he could not control.

His hands quickly formed a seal, trying to stabilize the power of the Chaotic Black Hole. However, he found the uncontrollable power was rapidly eroding his soul.

“Impossible! I will never let you succeed!” Yao Xi roared. He grabbed the black hole tightly with both hands, trying to suppress the powerful force.

However, Qin Yu did not give him the chance. His finger drew complex runes in the void. Each rune contained a powerful force that was directly injected into the Chaotic Black Hole.

The golden light grew increasingly brighter until it almost illuminated the entire Chaotic Black Hole. The power of destruction and calamity made everyone feel intense pressure.

“Rumble…”

Finally, after Qin Yu injected the third drop of blood essence, the golden light in the Chaotic Black Hole burst out with intense light. At the same time, the power in the Chaotic Black Hole also reached its limit.

“Bang!”

Under everyone’s astonished gazes, the Chaotic Black Hole suddenly exploded. A powerful force erupted from it, instantly shattering the surrounding space.

A terrifying roar resounded continuously, surging in all directions, and the deafening sound shattered numerous people’s eardrums!

In the center of the explosion, Qin Yu stood there calmly. His figure appeared immensely tall within the golden lights like an inviolable god.

Yao Xi was sent flying by the impact of the explosion. His body kept rolling in the air, and his face was full of fear. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

He had thought that the Chaotic Black Hole could devour everything, but he did not expect Qin Yu to be able to use his blood essence to detonate the Chaotic Black Hole. This method was really unimaginable.

“This… How is this possible…” Yao Xi looked at the center of the explosion in shock. He could not believe his eyes.

The others were the same. They looked at the center of the explosion in shock. They could not believe that Qin Yu did it.

“Qin Yu… He actually did it…” someone exclaimed.

“He blew up the Chaotic Black Hole…”

The entire scene fell into dead silence for a moment. Everyone was shocked by Qin Yu’s method.

Even Holy Son Jiang and Saintess Gu were slightly stunned as if they did not expect Qin Yu to actually crack this secret technique!

Only Jue Wu looked calm. She muttered, “This Chaotic Black Hole is nothing compared to Rashomon.”

Just as Jue Wu had said, compared to Xiao Sheng’s Rashomon, this Chaotic Black Hole was too inferior!

If Qin Yu were attacked by Xiao Sheng, he would not have been able to crack this technique so easily!

“Yao Xi, it’s a pity that your Chaotic Black Hole isn’t used to its full potential,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Yao Xi gritted his teeth and shouted, “Don’t be happy too early. This is just the beginning! The secret techniques of my Yao family are endless, and I can kill you like an ant!”

“Is that so?” Qin Yu sneered and said. Could it be that you can forcefully erase my divine sense? If you can’t do that, you will definitely lose today!”

“Bullsh*t! No matter what price I have to pay today, I must kill you!” Yao Xi raised his head and roared furiously. The Emperor Shadow Technique was instantly unleashed to its extreme!

Following that, Yao Xi opened his mouth and spat out golden lotuses!
