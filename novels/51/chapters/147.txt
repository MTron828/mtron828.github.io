Chapter 148: I’ll Be the Doctor! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Seeing Lei Hu’s nervous attitude, the crowd couldn’t help but feel stunned.

And the golden-chained man’s expression changed drastically!

To people like them, Lei Hu was legendary. No one dared to provoke him!

“So these people were summoned by that young man.”

“No wonder this young man dares to be so cocky. Looks like he has a powerful background.”

Everyone discussed animatedly and took a few steps back in unison.

Qin Yu glanced at the man with the golden chains and said, “I’ll leave this person to you.”

Lei Hu hurriedly nodded and said, “No problem.”

After saying that, Lei Hu waved his hand, and everyone immediately swarmed forward. In just a few moments, they pressed the man with the golden chains to the ground!

“Mr. Hu, I didn’t know that he was your man. I... I was wrong...” the man with the golden chains said with a terrified expression.

When Lei Hu heard this, he immediately berated, “One of my people? He is Mr. Qin Yu. If you dare to be disrespectful, I definitely won’t forgive you!”

When they heard Qin Yu’s name, there was once again an uproar.

“So he’s Qin Yu! No wonder he’s so confident!”

“Not long ago, Qin Yu defeated the Liu family of South City!”

“I heard that his medical skills are also outstanding!”

Zhou Tong, who wasn’t far away, narrowed his eyes.

He sized up Qin Yu and sneered. “So you’re Qin Yu. I’ve heard of your name. I heard that the Soul Nourishment Pill came from you.”

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “I’m very sorry, but I’ve never heard of your name.”

Zhou Tong’s expression turned cold. He narrowed his eyes and said, “Qin Yu, speaking of which, you and I are also people of the same field. Why do you have to offend me for a peasant’s sake?”

“Of the same field?” Qin Yu snickered.

“A person who is greedy for money and tramples on people of lower status while kissing up to people of higher status is worthy to be of the same field as me?” Qin Yu spoke harshly, causing Zhou Tong to blush.

Zhou Tong said with a cold expression, “Qin Yu, don’t be too cocky. Sooner or later, you will need me!”

“I’m sorry. I won’t need someone like you for the rest of my life,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Just as Zhou Tong was about to fly into a rage, a middle-aged man in a suit and tie ran over.

This middle-aged man was none other than the dean of the Chinese Medical Hospital.

He ran to the middle of the two people in a panic and asked awkwardly, “What... what’s going on?”

Zhou Tong immediately snorted and said, “Mr. Ding, I traveled thousands of miles from the provincial capital to Jiangcheng to treat patients for you. Is this how you treat me?”

Mr. Ding hurriedly said, “Doctor Zhou, is... is there some kind of misunderstanding...”

“Misunderstanding?” Zhou Tong raised his eyebrows. He pointed at Qin Yu and berated, “I was kind enough to treat patients for you, but this person came to cause trouble. Mr. Ding, what sort of security measures does this hospital have?!”

Mr. Ding glanced at Qin Yu and immediately complained inside.

Qin Yu had become famous recently, so Mr. Ding couldn’t afford to offend either of these two people.

“Mr. ... Mr. Qin, what exactly is going on...” Mr. Ding braced himself and asked.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “Aren’t you afraid of affecting the reputation of your hospital by inviting this kind of person to give a consultation?”

“Mr. Ding, you heard him, right? No matter what, I am his senior, yet he spoke to me so rudely!” Zhou Tong snorted coldly.

“I demand that you kick him out immediately, or else I will cancel today’s consultations!” Zhou Tong’s tone carried a hint of threat.

The crowd immediately panicked. They had already queued for so long. In order to see Zhou Tong, countless people had specially asked for leave.

Mr. Ding was even more worried. In order to invite Zhou Tong, he had spent a large amount of money. If he left now, all his efforts would be in vain!

Zhou Tong looked at Qin Yu smugly and said with a sneer, “Kid, don’t you have a benevolent heart? Then hurry up and get lost. Otherwise, these people will have nowhere to go even if they want to see a doctor.”

“Nowhere to go?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

“Do you really think you’re a big shot? Do you think that other than you, no one else can treat people?” Qin Yu sneered again and again.

Zhou Tong sneered and said, “What do you mean?”

Qin Yu didn’t pay attention to Zhou Tong. Instead, he looked at Mr. Ding and said, “Mr. Ding, if you don’t mind, I’m willing to take Zhou Tong’s place. I’ll give free consultations and treat patients for free.”

“Hahahaha!” As soon as Qin Yu finished speaking, Zhou Tong couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“Qin Yu, do you think that just because you developed the Soul Nourishment Pill, it means that your medical skills are extraordinary?” Zhou Tong questioned loudly.

“I, Zhou Tong, started to study medicine at the age of eight, became famous at the age of nineteen, and mastered Chinese and Western medicine at the age of twenty-seven! Now, I’m even called a Medical Genius! Who do you think you are?” Zhou Tong sneered.

Mr. Ding was also somewhat conflicted. After all, he wasn’t familiar with Qin Yu at all.

Moreover, Qin Yu indeed didn’t have much of a reputation in the medical world.

“Mr. Qin, you have a noble status. How can you treat our patients...” the person beside him said even more softly.

“That’s right. Mr. Qin, why don’t you leave first? We can spend some money ...”

“Mr. Qin, we know that you have good intentions, but...”

Everyone stepped forward to advise him. It was obvious that they didn’t believe in Qin Yu’s abilities at all.

Qin Yu looked at Mr. Ding and said, “Mr. Ding, what do you think?”

Mr. Ding thought for a moment and mustered up his courage to say, “Mr. Qin, I know that you have a famous reputation. It’s just that we have only heard of your medical skills and have never seen them before. I wonder if you can show them to us on the spot?”

“Yes, Mr. Qin. It’s not that we don’t believe you, but... we don’t want to take the risk...” someone beside him said.

Qin Yu nodded. He looked at the peasant beside him and said politely, “I just promised to treat your daughter’s illness. Are you willing to believe me?”

The peasant’s expression was somewhat conflicted. She looked at the crying child in her arms and then at Qin Yu.

Then, she gritted her teeth and said, “Mr. Qin, I believe you because you’re willing to offend Zhou Tong for the sake of a peasant like me!”

“Alright.” Qin Yu immediately walked in front of the child.

He slowly raised his hand and placed it on the little girl’s forehead.

Following that, traces of spiritual energy flowed along Qin Yu’s palm and surged towards the little girl’s forehead.

In just thirty seconds, the little girl’s crying stopped abruptly!

The peasant was stunned. She hurriedly raised her hand and placed it on the little girl’s forehead. She exclaimed, “The fever has really subsided. The fever has really subsided!”

Mr. Ding hurriedly went forward and examined the little girl.

“The fever has indeed subsided!” Mr. Ding said with a shocked expression.

“Mr. Qin, thank you so much!” The peasant wanted to bow to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu gently waved his hand, and a gentle force lifted the peasant up.

“I will never go back on my promise. You don’t have to bow to me,” Qin Yu said indifferently.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
