Chapter 946: So what if he was a martial saint in the 946th Chapter! 

His speed was pushed to the limit in an instant, but Qin Yu managed to dodge every single time!

Zeng Ji could not help but become even more furious after failing to hit the mark repeatedly.

Gu Xinghe’s expression became even gloomier.

If a martial saint could not take down a martial marquis as soon as possible, then he would have already lost!

The surrounding people also started to discuss in low voices.

“Damn, this Qin Yu is actually on par with a martial saint?”

“Is this martial saint too weak, or is Qin Yu Too Strong?”

“TSK TSK, he already has such abilities even at the Martial Marquis Realm. If he were to step into the martial saint realm, I don’t know how terrifying he would be!”

When he heard the surrounding discussions, Zeng Ji became even more furious.

He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Do you only know how to hide?”

“What, I can’t even hide? Who told you to be so slow?”Qin Yu mocked.

“As a martial saint, you are so weak. How dare you talk nonsense?”

Zeng ji suppressed his anger and said, “How long can you hide? So what if you are fast? I still have a way to deal with you!”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and nodded. “Alright, then I won’t hide anymore.”

If he continued to hide like this, Qin Yu’s spiritual power would definitely be the first to be depleted.

Moreover, with the martial saint’s ability, they could shrink the space again. At that time, Qin Yu would have nowhere to hide even if he wanted to.

Zeng ji narrowed his eyes slightly. A storm was rapidly brewing on his fists.

Zeng Ji seemed to want to get back his lost face.

Therefore, the power on his fists was terrifyingly strong!

Qin Yu didn’t dare to be careless. He stared at Zeng Ji’s fists and said coldly, “Come!”

Then, Zeng Ji dashed toward Qin Yu with a swoosh!

Qin Yu also shouted angrily. The absolute beginning Holy Fist was unleashed to the maximum in an instant!

“Boom!”

At the instant of the collision, the sealed space seemed to have become unstable, and layers of cracks appeared!

If it wasn’t for the space seal, just this collision’s storm alone would have turned everyone into meat paste!

The light gradually dissipated, and Qin Yu’s body was sent flying.

Cracks appeared on his fist, and his thumb was even cracked open, and blood dripped down. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Not only that, the power that poured out from his fist had even shocked Qin Yu’s internal organs.

“As expected of a martial saint...”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

He wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and supported himself to stand up.

Zeng Ji laughed out loud and said, “Weren’t you very arrogant just now? Why, is that all you’ve Got?”

Qin Yu remained silent.

The strength of a martial saint was still much stronger than he had imagined.

“Go to hell!”

Zeng Ji let out an angry roar. He suddenly used a secret technique and two large void hands grabbed Qin Yu directly!

“Five Thunder Palm Print!”

Zeng Ji let out an explosive shout. Faint blue lightning burst out from his fists and smashed fiercely onto Qin Yu’s body!

Qin Yu’s body was caught in the air and could not move at all. This punch was firmly blocked.

“Pu!”

Qin Yu spat out a mouthful of blood, and the golden light on his body was directly shattered!

“What, is that all you’ve got!”Zeng ji sneered.

Qin Yu tried to break free, but he found that he couldn’t break free at all.

“F * ck!”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse in his heart!

If this continued, he might really be beaten to death!

“Looks like I still have to use the ‘Dou’character...”Qin Yu thought to himself.

After saying that, he narrowed his eyes slightly and used the ‘Dou’character in an instant!

A huge ‘dou’character floated out in front of Qin Yu! Qin Yu’s strength instantly increased tenfold!

At a glance, one could even see waves of energy storms around Qin Yu’s body!

“Boom!”

As Qin Yu’s body shook, the two big hands were directly shattered!

“Huh? Nine secret fighting formula?”Gu Xinghe frowned slightly.

“It seems that Jiang he passed the nine secret fighting formula to this kid,”Zhai Xing muttered in a low voice.

However, Zeng Ji didn’t take it seriously at all. He sneered and said, “In the face of absolute strength, any spell is Bullsh * t!”

After he had finished speaking, he took big strides and rushed towards Qin Yu. His pair of iron fists were aimed directly at Qin Yu’s face!

This time, Qin Yu did not Dodge or Dodge. He relied on the fighting word formula to fight with Zeng Ji with his physical body!

For a moment, there were continuous booming sounds like thunder!

In the blink of an eye, both parties had exchanged dozens of punches. However, Zeng Ji was still unable to take down Qin Yu!

Although Qin Yu’s injuries were more serious, being able to fight with a martial saint in the Martial Marquis realm was already something to be proud of!

“As expected of a martial saint...”Qin Yu could not help but mutter softly as he took a few steps back during the exchange of blows.

Zeng Ji could not help but curse, “Kid, are you really a half-step martial saint realm cultivator?”

Qin Yu sneered, “What, have you suffered a blow?”

“F * ck you!”Zeng Ji cursed.

Gu Xinghe, who was beside him, shouted, “Zeng Ji, what are you waiting for? Hurry up and finish this battle!”

Zeng Ji took a glance at gu xinghe and nodded, “I understand.”

As he spoke, the internal Qi on Zeng Ji’s body changed.

It was as if all his power had gathered at a certain point. It was obvious that he was using some kind of trump card technique.

“Hahahaha!”Qin Yu could not help but burst into laughter when he saw this.

“What bullshit martial saint! He’s blowing his trumpet so loudly that it shook the sky. Now, it seems that he’s only so-so!”

“His trump card? is he going to force you into such a situation when dealing with a half-step martial saint?”

Arrogant words filled the entire world!

However, no one thought that Qin Yu was bragging! His performance had already gained everyone’s approval!

Zeng Ji did not say anything. On his back, rays of light that were like flames condensed.

These rays of light soared and finally turned into two huge axes!

The axes flickered with a coquettish light. The extremely terrifying power was even more terrifying!

Everyone was stunned by this move, except for Qin Yu who was still laughing loudly.

“Hahahaha! Is this your trump card? !”Qin Yu could not stop laughing.

“Everyone below the martial saint level is an ant. Today, I, an ant, will slaughter a Saint!”

“History? History is left for people to create!”

After a roar, all the Golden Light on Qin Yu’s body surged towards his right fist!

The power of the Divine Dragon, the spiritual fire, and all the other powers gathered on his right fist!

This technique was the ten thousand arts destruction technique that Qin Yu had created himself!

At this moment, Qin Yu’s hair was wildly dancing, and his crazy laughter was so loud that it made people’s ears hurt!

His crazy posture shocked everyone!

“One punch can break all laws!”

With Qin Yu’s angry roar, all the golden light exploded on his right fist!
