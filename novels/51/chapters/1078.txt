Chapter 1079: Chapter 1,079, challenging a mighty figure! 

The Mustache Man came forward and said with a smile, “If one day, you can really go to that star field, you have to help me take revenge.”

Qin Yu said with a dark face, “Revenge? How can I help you take revenge? You have dug up their ancestral grave. Even if they cut you into a thousand pieces, you deserve it.”

The Mustache Man widened his eyes and said, “Kid, I didn’t tell you so much for nothing! You Can’t be ungrateful!”

Qin Yu helplessly waved his hand and said, “Alright, Alright. If that day really comes, we can talk about it later.”

“Don’t worry. Since Yan Ruoxue is a member of the Yan family, you will definitely go. It’s just a matter of time.”The mustached man said with a smile.

Qin Yu grunted and didn’t say anything more.

“Forget it. Since I’ve already helped you, I’ll help you to the end.”At this time, the mustached man suddenly said.

With a flick of his palm, he took out threads of golden light from the spatial divine artifact.

“What is this?”Qin Yu asked.

The mustached man said, “This object can bring you to the true realm of a mighty figure, but it can only be used once.”

“If you infuse this object into your divine sense, it can evolve into a true battle.”

Qin Yu said in alarm, “This is the same logic as the picture in the second secret realm.”

The Mustache Man ignored these words and said with some pride, “Kid, this is a holy object. With your current strength, it is a valuable treasure to fight with a mighty figure.”

These words were true. After becoming a martial saint, it was already impossible to increase one’s strength by relying on resources alone.

Many times, one had to comprehend the Great Dao in a big battle to improve one’s state of mind.

“Alright, give it to me.”Qin Yu stretched out his hand and received the ray of light.

He twisted the ray of light with his hand and then closed his eyes. The Ray of light followed the space between his brows and entered his divine sense.

The primordial spirit that was sitting cross-legged in his mind instantly opened its eyes.

Following that, he saw the figure of a top-notch martial artist!

The figure of a top-notch martial artist in his mind was clearly even more powerful. Even though he still had a wretched internal Qi all over his body, there was an additional trace of strength and dominance. Every movement of his gave off the aura of an expert.

“Is this the handlebar mustache of a mighty figure?”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

He closed his eyes slightly, and the figure of the handlebar mustache directly entered Qin Yu’s primordial spirit.

This was the process of an evolutionary battle. It was not a real battle, but an evolution of the primordial spirit through the comparison of the strength of both sides.

Qin Yu closed his eyes tightly. This battle did not require him to participate too much, because it was purely an evolution, a theoretical battle.

The mustached man on the side looked at Qin Yu quietly. He put his hands behind his back as if he was watching a show.

“Humph, this kid can only last for three minutes at most.”The mustached man thought to himself.

It was because he knew very well the difference between the martial saint and the Almighty.

However, in the blink of an eye, three minutes had passed. Qin Yu still closed his eyes slightly and did not walk out of his divine sense.

The mustached man frowned slightly, and there was a hint of displeasure in his eyes.

In the blink of an eye, ten minutes had passed, but Qin Yu still had not opened his eyes.

“Damn it!”This immediately made the mustached man extremely displeased!

One had to know that the trace of light contained his peak condition!

If he could not instantly kill a martial saint, he would lose all face if word got out!

However, ten minutes had already passed, yet Qin Yu was still not defeated!

“I don’t believe it. Is this kid pretending with his eyes closed?”The mustached man muttered.

He tried to call out Qin Yu’s name, but Qin Yu did not react in the slightest.

This made the mustached man feel a little uneasy. He paced around the room and kept pacing back and forth.

“This kid won’t die, right?”The moustache man muttered.

He pinched his fingers and counted the time. Thirteen minutes had passed.

This didn’t make sense at all!

Finally, at the seventeenth minute, Qin Yu opened his eyes with a Swish. There was a trace of fear on his face.

“How is this possible!”Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He couldn’t help but feel a little afraid.

“What’s Wrong?”The mustached man hurriedly walked over and asked.

When he saw the mustached man, Qin Yu subconsciously took two steps back, but he quickly came back to his senses.

He patted his chest and said in alarm, “I didn’t expect you to be so powerful... I almost didn’t have the strength to fight back.”

“The almighty realm... seems to have exceeded my imagination.”

The mustached man could not help but say, “Don’t be insatiable, Kid. According to my calculations, it’s already good enough that you can hold on for three minutes. I didn’t expect you to hold on for a full seventeen minutes!”

“Seventeen minutes? is that a lot?”Qin Yu frowned and said.

The mustached man immediately widened his eyes and berated, “Kid, you’re looking down on me!”

“Let me tell you, there are many top geniuses who have died at my hands. There are also countless martial saints. They will die at my hands in just one exchange!”

“Seventeen minutes. Do you know what this means?”

Although he said this, Qin Yu’s face was solemn.

According to the calculations of this battle, Qin Yu had no chance of winning at all.

“To think that someone at the Almighty realm is so powerful...”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

Seeing that Qin Yu did not take his words seriously, the moustache man immediately became anxious.

“Kid, don’t be Insatiable!”The moustache man cursed.

“Let me tell you this. No martial saint has been able to last seventeen minutes under me!”

Qin Yu still did not pay attention to him. He muttered in a low voice, “In this case, if I meet the higher-ups, I’m afraid I will die without a doubt...”

The moustache man snorted lightly and said, “Although that higher-ups are also in the Almighty realm, how can they be compared to me?”

Qin Yu suddenly raised his head and looked at the moustache man. He said, “According to what you said, if I meet those eight higher-ups, I still have a chance of winning?”

“No.”The moustache man shook his head without even thinking.

“However, judging from your current performance, you should be able to hold on for more than half an hour before you die.”

“Screw you.”Qin Yu could not help but curse.

The man with the handlebar mustache rolled his eyes and said, “Kid, you are only at the early-stage of the Martial Saint Realm. According to the current evolution, if you step into the middle-stage, you might have a slight chance of winning.”

“If you step into the late-stage of the martial saint realm, or the peak of the martial saint realm, it is not impossible for you to jump ranks and kill mighty figures.”UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m
