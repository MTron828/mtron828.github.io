2368 The Monster Race Army

Qin Yu only opened his eyes when he almost fully recovered.

“F*ck, I must find a chance to kill this Hua Tian. Otherwise, it will always be a big problem if such a person keeps thinking about me.”

Qin Yu was a little angry. Previously, when he was severely injured, he suffered from Hua Tian’s Fist of the Great Expansion Divine Technique. Fortunately, Jue Wu was by his side, so Hua Tian dared not reveal his true form. This time, he was schemed against again.

“This Great Expansion Divine Techniques is a cultivation method left behind by a Buddha undergoing tribulation in ancient times. I wonder where Hua Tian had obtained this inheritance. With this kind of divination technique, it’s probably very difficult to kill him.”

Elder Guai had lived for a long time and heard of Hua Tian, so he continued after Qin Yu.

“No matter what cultivation method, it can’t be perfect. Otherwise, that Buddha wouldn’t have died.”

Qin Yu had circulated the Five Element Eight Trigram Technique in the Annihilation Immortal Scripture before, so he began to have some understanding of this type of cultivation method.

As he shuttled back and forth along the way, Qin Yu experienced tens of thousands of spaces.

Some spaces had been completely occupied by the monster race and ghost race. The humans there had all become bloodthirsty slaves.

When he passed through these spaces, he was as if experiencing hell on earth.

Moreover, some of the monsters even emitted powerful demonic qi, forcing Qin Yu to look sideways.

Suddenly, Qin Yu stopped. At this moment, they were near the Black Platform Continent.

A vast amount of demonic qi was moving toward the Black Platform Continent like a tide.

“The monster race army!”

Qin Yu looked somewhat shocked. These monster race armies were all wearing armor, and this armor was wrapped in a layer of obscure internal qi.

It allowed the armor to take the rudimentary form of a low-grade magical artifact. This naturally would not catch the cultivator’s attention.

But at this moment, it was a complete army, and all the members of the monster race were wearing this type of armor.

The internal qi it emitted was enough to make people tremble in fear.

“There must be at least 100,000 monster race armies. This is the first time the monsters attack humans on such a large scale.”

This was the first time Chang Mang had seen such a large scale of monsters, and he was shocked, too.

What was even more shocking was that there was a leader for every 100 people, a captain for every 5,000 people, and at last, a young man with two small horns and soaring demonic qi. His upper body was naked.

He had terrifying scars all over his body, and a corner of his head and chin were cut off.

From the looks of it, it was obvious that he had been in a killing environment all year round.

At the front of the Black Platform Continent, thousands of cultivators had gathered at the entrance.

These cultivators basically belonged to the sects and aristocratic families of the Black Platform Continent. Their family businesses were there, so this time, they could not avoid it.

“Kill them!”

Finally, they saw the vanguard of the monster race army.

Some cultivators could not hold it in any longer. The spiritual energy on their bodies erupted, and they suddenly charged into the vanguard of the monster race army.

“Boom!”

All the thousands of cultivators were powerful, and the weakest among them was at the Mighty Realm.

Many powerful True Saint cultivators were also much stronger than the overall cultivation of the monster race. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

They plunged into the monster race army like arrows and started to attack.

In an instant, the entire vanguard army of the monster race was thrown into chaos. Countless monsters died at the hands of human cultivators.

“Although these monster race vanguards have suffered heavy casualties, their formation is not chaotic at all. The other teams have already surrounded these human cultivators.”

Qin Yu’s divine sense swept across the entire monster race army, and he immediately sensed that something was amiss.

Sure enough, after a round of killing, the cultivators’ spiritual energy became somewhat insufficient.

In an instant, they were surrounded.

These monsters surrounded several people in teams. Even if the cultivators on the periphery tried their best to kill them, they did not care at all and just killed the cultivators in the encirclement.

Screams instantly spread throughout the entire continent, and the hearts of many people there trembled.

No one had expected the cultivators of the Black Platform Continent to be defeated so soon.

Even more cultivators fled frantically. Those ordinary cultivators without magical artifacts and ordinary people stared blankly at the incoming armies, and City Lord Hei Yun was nowhere to be found.

There might be a chance to defend if somebody had organized the team.

But now, a large number of cultivators were watching. When they saw that something was wrong, they immediately fled.

The entire Black Platform Continent was in chaos. No matter how strong those thousands of cultivators were, it was useless.

“Flame Burning the Source.”

The Starfire on Suo Lin dripped onto the ground, and the raging flames surged like a tide.

Countless monsters in the vanguard armies instantly turned into charcoals, and a large number of human cultivators survived.

However, they were scared out of their wits. After escaping from the encirclement, they fled frantically.

“Qin Yu, you’re an obvious target now. Not only is the Holy Region paying attention to you, but countless pairs of eyes are behind you. You better don’t attack.”

Elder Guai hesitated for a moment before trying to dissuade him.

“It’s fine. I don’t care about these cultivators, but tens of millions of cultivators and ordinary people are in the city. If this monster race charges into the city, I’m afraid these people will turn to ashes.”

Qin Yu sighed, and he could not help but attack.

When shuttling along, he saw the tragic state of many planes.

Countless monster race armies charged toward them.

“Great! You came at the right time!”

Chang Mang had already rushed into the armies impatiently. These monster race armies were no match for him at all.

“I’ll capture several monsters and try out how they taste.”

Jue Wu also rushed in and started killing wantonly.

Qin Yu was not worried. These monster race’s strengths were all very low and could not pose a threat to the two people at all.

He stared at the monster race youth sitting on the giant carriage, and their gazes bumped into each other.

Qin Yu wanted to test the strength of the monster race. He narrowed his eyes and said softly.

“Fire Fist!”

In the void, countless flames gathered.

After accumulating power to the utmost, the Fire Fist suddenly flew out.

Along the way, the monster race army suddenly opened a massive opening.

On the ground, the path of the Fire Fist left a ravine that was several thousand feet long. The terrifying high temperature burned the ground in the surroundings into flowing glass.

Even more monster race troops were pouncing in waves.

Some hundred-man teams even used their physical bodies to block the Fire Fist to reduce a trace of its power.

In the end, the Fire Fist dissipated before the young man.

The young man sitting in the giant carriage did not change his expression. He stood up and grabbed a long halberd.

Then he threw it at Qin Yu. The halberd pierced through space.

In an instant, it arrived in front of Qin Yu. The power of this halberd had also reached the power of a half-step Tribulation Transcending Stage.

Qin Yu gripped the halberd with two fingers and melted the weapon into a pool of molten iron.

“We will meet again.”

A thought was transmitted over. Almost at the same time, the monster race armies seemed to have heard some order.

The remaining monster race armies slowly retreated. They did not panic despite being pursued by Jue Wu and Chang Mang.
