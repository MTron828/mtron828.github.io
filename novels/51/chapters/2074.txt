2075 Experiencing Both Ice and Fire

Even though Holy Son Jiang was fully prepared this time and had entered with a tribulation magical artifact, he was still almost killed by the mysterious creatures in the depths of the cave.

If not for the protection of the tribulation magical artifact, Holy Son Jiang would probably have become a corpse by now.

Si Shiyue could not help but sneer when he saw Holy Son Jiang coming out in a sorry state.

He stepped forward and said, “Holy Son Jiang, it’s time for you to hand over the supreme bone in your hand.”

“Don’t worry. I always keep my word. I’ll give it to you. However, if you can get that sanctum, you must give it to our Jiang family.”

Although there was no agreement beforehand, Si Shiyue was eager to get the supreme bone. Thus he nodded and said, “Alright, I agree.”

Without delay, Holy Son Jiang immediately took out the supreme bone and handed it to Si Shiyue.

It was the last piece of supreme bone left in the Holy Region and even the entire universe. It was heavy in his hand.

Si Shiyue put away the supreme bone, took a deep breath, and said, “Traceless Immortal Scripture… I’m coming!”

After saying that, Si Shiyue was about to step in when Ji Qianjing walked up.

He looked at Si Shiyue and said, “Let me go. I don’t want anything untoward to happen.”

“No, I want to get the Traceless Immortal Scripture myself,” Si Shiyue said coldly.

Seeing Si Shiyue’s determined expression, Si Qianjing knew he could not stop him, so he could only nod and agree.

After that, Si Shiyue stepped into the Chaos Grave without hesitation.

At this moment, Si Shiyue was the center of attention. Almost everyone fixed their gazes on him.

They held their breaths and did not say a word.

In the blink of an eye, two days went by. There was still no movement in the Chaos Grave, and Si Shiyue did not come out.

This worried everyone, and Si Qianjing’s expression turned even more unsightly.

“Did Si Shiyue die inside…” someone in the crowd muttered, infuriating Si Qianjing!

He turned around and looked over coldly. A terrifying internal qi arrived in the blink of an eye, and the cultivator’s body turned into blood instantly!

“Whoever dares to spout nonsense again, don’t blame me for being ruthless!” Si Qianjing said coldly.

The scene instantly fell silent, and no one dared to say another word. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

In the blink of an eye, another three days had passed, but Si Shiyue still did not appear, and there was no movement in the Chaos Grave.

After all, it was the Chaos Grave, one of the most dangerous places in the world. Countless True Saints had died, and countless tribulation magical artifacts shattered!

Now that Si Shiyue stepped into it alone, no one knew what the outcome of it was.

“Elder, you don’t have to worry. If something really happened to the Holy Son, the Chaos Grave wouldn’t be so quiet,” a cultivator walked over and whispered at this moment.

Si Qianjing seemed to have remembered something. He narrowed his eyes, body shook, then came before Holy Son Jiang.

“Junior of the Jiang family, let me ask you, what did you see in the Chaos Grave?” Si Qianjing stood in front of Holy Son Jiang and said calmly.

Holy Son Jiang naturally did not dare to be negligent in front of the Supreme Elder of the Si family. He smiled faintly and said, “Senior, to be honest, this Chaos Grave is indeed full of danger. It has heavy chaotic qi”

Si Qianjing frowned and said in a low voice, “Chaos qi? That’s the internal qi that could breed living beings…”

“That’s right. There are indeed living beings in that grave, and their strength has exceeded the True Saint cultivation realm,” Holy Son Jiang smiled and said.

“Sigh, their casual attack almost shattered the tribulation magical artifact in my hand. I would have probably died inside if I hadn’t escaped quickly.”

Si Qianjing’s expression turned ugly. In this era, surpassing a True Saint was equivalent to being invincible.

Si Shiyue was not surprised that no one could resist the creatures inside once they attacked.

“Fortunately, there’s no movement in the Chaos Grave,” Si Qianjing whispered.

Holy Son Jiang narrowed his eyes slightly and then said with a somewhat sinister tone, “Speaking of which, it’s strange. The dao technique seems to have bred in the chaotic qi. Those living beings have even comprehended this dao technique to the extreme. When they attack, there are thousands of dao techniques following them. They can silently take people’s lives. It’s so terrifying!”

“Comprehended the dao technique? Silently?” Si Qianjing’s expression changed drastically!

He stared fixedly at the Chaos Grave. The fear and worry in his eyes could not be concealed!

Seeing this, Holy Son Jiang could not help but sneer in his heart.

“Old thing! Don’t you know how to be polite when you speak? Let me scare you to death!” Holy Son Jiang muttered in his heart.

Despite him saying this, he looked harmless. When he saw how anxious Si Qianjing was, he felt even happier.

“Holy Son, is what you said just now true?” a cultivator walked over and whispered.

Holy Son Jiang snorted and muttered, “Of course not. Si Shiyue is most probably not dead. He has the same physique as Qin Yu, so he can probably walk out safe and sound.

“If Si Shiyue walks out, the truth will be revealed whether Qin Yu has obtained the Traceless Immortal Scripture. If Si Shiyue doesn’t walk out, Qin Yu must have other key treasures hidden in his hands!”

…

At this moment, Qin Yu was sitting cross-legged in the Dragon Burial Cave.

Just as Xiao Sheng had said, the environment of the Dragon Burial Cave had aggravated tremendously after the great change in the world. In addition to the dense dark energy, it occasionally exhaled an incredibly hot internal qi, which could be described as experiencing both ice and fire. It was tremendously tormenting.

That scorching internal qi almost roasted one’s divine sense. The coldness of the physical body collided greatly with the divine sense causing unbearable excruciating pain.

It was even more terrifying that under the urging of the dark energy, the spiritual energy in his body almost froze. It was nearly impossible to resist this terrifying internal qi using spiritual power.

Xiao Sheng stood outside the Dragon Burial Cave. He looked at the entrance and said in a low voice, “It’s been three days, and he still hasn’t come out.”

Back then, Xiao Sheng had wanted to cultivate here, but he only managed to resist for three days before leaving the Dragon Burial Cave.

But now, Qin Yu had endured for three days and still showed no signs of leaving.

“Looks like… His endurance has exceeded my prediction,” Xiao Sheng murmured.

Soon, five days had passed, but Qin Yu still had not walked out of the Dragon Burial Cave.

Saint Xiao frowned slightly. A hint of worry appeared in his heart. After thinking for a moment, he stood up and walked into the Dragon Burial Cave.

However, when he stepped into the Dragon Burial Cave, the scene in front of him shocked him!
