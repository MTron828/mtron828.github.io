Chapter 59: You Don’t Have a Chance Anymore Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu, along with Lance and Yao Qing, slowly walked to the front of the crowd.

“Mr. Qin, you’re here!” Seeing Qin Yu, Zheng Mingshuo immediately heaved a sigh of relief.

At the side, the faces of Lincheng and the others turned cold.

“It’s you?” Lincheng narrowed his eyes and said.

Qin Yu sneered as he said, “Why can’t it be me?”

“You traitor, you actually ran to the other side!” Lin Wan pointed at Qin Yu and scolded.

Qin Yu glanced at her and sneered as he said, “Traitor? What’s the relationship between me and you?”

“Nonsense! We’ve looked for you, so you can’t look for other people. Don’t you understand?!” Lin Wan looked arrogant and domineering.

Qin Yu looked at Lin Wan coldly and said, “Don’t think that everyone in the world is your father and will spoil you. If you weren’t a girl, I would have slapped you long ago.”

When she heard this, not only did Lin Wan not restrain herself, but she became even more aggressive.

She stuck her face in front of Qin Yu and shouted, “Come, try hitting me! How capable are you?!”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Sorry, I don’t hit dogs.”

“You!” Lin Wan was enraged and was about to make a move.

At this time, Qi Yang reached out his hand to stop Lin Wan and said with a smile, “Lin Wan, don’t you want revenge? Isn’t this a good opportunity?”

Lin Wan was stunned and then said excitedly, “That’s right! Qi Yang, you must give him a good beating!”

“Don’t worry.” Qi Yang’s eyes flashed with a hint of viciousness.

Lincheng also nodded slightly and said, “That’s right. Even the Yan family can’t say anything about a fair fight.”

Zheng Mingshuo, who was listening by the side, was confused and didn’t understand the situation for a moment.

“So you guys know each other,” Zheng Mingshuo, puzzled, said.

Lincheng said with a nonchalant smile, “We’ve crossed paths before, but we don’t really know each other.”

“Who would know a loser like him?” Lin Wan snorted lightly.

Qin Yu was too lazy to argue with them, so he didn’t reply.

The few of them sat on the spectator stand while quietly waiting for the start of the match.

At this time, many people had already arrived at the venue.

“Isn’t that guy Qin Yu? The one who appeared at the Yan family’s banquet not long ago?”

“Yes, I heard that he even broke Shen Tian’s arm!”

“This guy has been doing well recently. He’s a big shot in Jiangcheng.”

“Without the Yan family, he’s nothing.”

Everyone spoke one after another, but not many people thought highly of Qin Yu.

“Qi Yang, I want you to break his legs to avenge me!” Lin Wan said with a vicious expression.

Qi Yang smiled nonchalantly and said, “Alright, I’ll do as you say. I’ll break both of his legs.”

Even though their voices were very soft, Qin Yu could still hear them clearly.

“He’s really ruthless.” Qin Yu’s expression couldn’t help but turn cold.

He wanted to break someone’s legs because of an argument. How overbearing.

Qin Yu glanced at them coldly and made up his mind.

At this moment, the host walked onto the stage.

With the host’s introduction, the competition officially began.

“Qi Yang, don’t hold back,” Lincheng shouted at Qi Yang before he went on stage.

Qi Yang bowed slightly and said, “Please don’t worry, Uncle Lin.”

Zheng Mingshuo was a little worried. He couldn’t help but remind him in a low voice, “Mr. Qin, you must be careful. The people of the Lin Family Martial Arts School have always been ruthless.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Don’t worry, Mr. Zheng.”

The two stood on the stage and looked at each other coldly.

Qi Yang’s lips curled into a sneer and he said, “It’s not too late to repent now. As long as you apologize to Lin Wan, I can forgive you.”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Sorry, it’s too late. I don’t plan to let you off the hook.”

Hearing this, Qi Yang couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“How arrogant! Today, I will let you get a taste of what an inner strength expert is!” Qi Yang shouted and his inner strength began to flow rapidly in his body!

“Die!” Qi Yang roared and rushed toward Qin Yu with clenched fists!

Qi Yang was extremely vicious. He raised his hand and charged towards Qin Yu with all his might!

This made Qin Yu’s expression turn even colder.

“What grudge is there between us? He looks like he actually wants to kill me.” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and couldn’t help but mutter softly.

“As expected of Mr. Lin’s disciple!”

“How fast! The Lin Family Martial Arts School is getting stronger and stronger!”

“I’m afraid this guy is dead meat!”

At this moment, Qi Yang had already rushed in front of Qin Yu! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Qin Yu didn’t move an inch and only looked at Qi Yang coldly.

Just as Qi Yang’s fist was about to touch Qin Yu, Qin Yu suddenly raised his hand and grabbed his fist!
