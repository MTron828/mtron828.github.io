Chapter 129: I’ll Drink With You Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Chen Xin hurriedly said, “Sun Ying just had a gathering with her classmates and was brought to the bar by her classmates. I’m afraid that something might happen to her. Can you come with us?”

Qin Yu looked at the time. It was already 10 o’clock in the evening.

“Why aren’t you back at school when it’s so late? Why are you going to the bar? Don’t you know that you’re in danger?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but say with a somewhat reproachful tone.

“Gee, it was them who dragged us here. We couldn’t turn them down,” Chen Xin said with some grievance.

“Just come with us. I beg you,” Chen Xin said sweetly on the other end of the line.

Although Qin Yu didn’t have a good impression of the Su family, Sun Ying was too young. Qin Yu really couldn’t just turn a blind eye to the fact that she was in a dangerous situation.

“Give me the location. I’ll go there in a while,” Qin Yu said.

Chen Xin was instantly delighted. She quickly said, “We’re in private room no. 888 at Midnight KTV888 now.”

“Got it,” Qin Yu answered and hung up the phone.

Then, Qin Yu looked at Yao Qing and said, “Let’s go to Midnight KTV.”

“What? Mr. Qin, you also want to have some fun?” Yao Qing said jokingly.

Qin Yu gave him a kick and rolled his eyes. “I’m not interested in that. Let’s go.”

The car sped along, and the roar of the engine resonated throughout the entire street.

Soon, the two of them arrived at the entrance of the Midnight KTV.

After going upstairs, Qin Yu learned that box 888 was a deluxe box, and those who came here to play were extremely affluent.

The entire eighth floor was different from the other floors. The boxes here were very large and full of VIPs.

Qin Yu and Yao Qing walked all the way to private room no. 888. When they pushed open the door, they saw a group of young men and women dancing wildly in the private room.

“Qin Yu!” After seeing Qin Yu, Chen Xin hurriedly ran over.

Sun Ying, who was sitting there drinking, said unhappily, “Why did you call him here? How annoying.”

Chen Xin grinned and said, “Gee, he’s your brother-in-law. Besides, it’s not safe at night.”

At this time, Sun Ying was drinking with a boy. The boy had bleached hair and dressed in fancy clothes. His designer clothes bespoke his identity as a rich heir.

Qin Yu glanced at him, then walked directly to Sun Ying’s side and said, “It’s late. Go back to your dorm and sleep.”

After saying that, Qin Yu pulled Sun Ying up and was about to leave.

“Let go of me! I’m not leaving!” Sun Ying was obviously drunk, and her words were a little slurred.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “You’re a young girl, so how can you not go home when it’s in the middle of the night?!”

“Don’t worry about me. I’m not leaving!” Sun Ying struggled to break free of his grasp.

At this time, the blondie beside Sun Ying got up and said, “Dude, who are you? Can’t you see that she doesn’t want to leave?”

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “I’m her brother-in-law.”

“You’ve already divorced my sister. You’re no longer my brother-in-law!” Sun Ying shouted in a daze.

The blonde immediately laughed. He sized up Qin Yu and said, “Dude, you heard her, right? Sun Ying said that you’re no longer her brother-in-law. Do you understand?”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He couldn’t be bothered to lower himself to the level of these brats.

Therefore, Qin Yu looked at Sun Ying and said, “I’ll ask you one last time. Are you coming?”

“No!” Sun Ying shouted without thinking.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I don’t care if you’re coming or not.”

After saying that, Qin Yu turned around and was about to leave.

At this time, Chen Xin hurriedly pulled Qin Yu back.

She said in a low voice, “Don’t go. If you leave, the two of us might be in trouble tonight...”

“It’s already good enough for me to come. It’s her who doesn’t want to leave. What does it have to do with me?” Qin Yu said with a cold expression.

Chen Xin grabbed Qin Yu’s arm and said pitifully, “She’s just drunk. Don’t lower yourself to her level.”

“Also... If you leave, the two of us will really be dead meat...”

Qin Yu glanced at the private room.

In the huge private room, there were a total of seven to eight boys, while Sun Ying and Chen Xin were the only girls.

If they left at this time, there was no telling what would happen.

Qin Yu thought about it for a moment. He looked at the time and said, “Okay, then I’ll wait for you guys for a while.”

“Thank you, thank you!” Chen Xin cried out in surprise.

Then, Qin Yu and Yao Qing found a random seat and sat down.

The commotion in the private room made Qin Yu a little annoyed.

The young people who were dancing wildly formed a sharp contrast with Qin Yu and Yao Qing.

Not far away, the yellow-haired man looked at Qin Yu with unhappiness.

“D*mn, why are these two idiots here? They’ll get in my way,” the yellow-haired man said with a cold expression.

The blonde was a frivolous rich heir who had screwed over a lot of young girls.

Tonight, he had lured Sun Ying and Chen Xin out for s*x.

As soon as Sun Ying and Chen Xin were drunk, these boys would drag them to the hotel.

“Dude, should we teach him a lesson?” At this time, a boy with dyed blue hair walked to the blonde’s ear and said.

The yellow-haired boy frowned and said, “How should we teach him a lesson? We can’t just go up and beat them up right now.”

“Dude, have you forgotten that my nickname is Wine God? Why don’t we challenge them to a drinking game until they’re drunk?” The blue-haired boy said with a smile.

The yellow-haired boy glanced at him, then patted his shoulder and said, “Okay, if you can drink they’re drunk, you can bang these two girls first!”

“Dude, leave it to me!” The guy with blue hair patted his chest and said.

At this moment, Qin Yu was looking at Sun Ying.

Sun Ying was being forcefully fed alcohol by a few men. Her consciousness was already drifting away, but the wine was being poured down her throat one cup after another.

“Don’t drink anymore!” Qin Yu walked in front of Sun Ying with a cold expression and snatched the wine cup away.

The guy with blue hair, who was beside him, was delighted when he saw this.

“Since you stirred things up, don’t blame me.” The guy with blue hair sneered.

Then, he sat beside Qin Yu with a smile and said, “I came out to drink so I could have a good time. Sun Ying didn’t even say that she wanted to stop drinking. What are you so worked up for? Why don’t you drink for her?”

“That’s right. Why don’t you drink for her, or you shut up!” The yellow-haired boy, who was beside him, also shouted.

Yao Qing frowned slightly. He was just about to get up and berate him when he was stopped by Qin Yu.

Qin Yu sized up the yellow-haired man and the blue-haired man, then sneered. “I can drink with you, but you have to drink as much as I drink. Do you dare to?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

When the blue-haired man heard that, he was immediately overjoyed.

Wasn’t this just what he wanted?

Hence, the blue-haired man immediately nodded and said, “Of course, there’s no problem. Let’s drink alone! If you can’t outdrink me, then get lost immediately. How about that?”

“Then what if you can’t outdrink me?” Qin Yu asked back.

The guy with blue hair sneered and said, “If I can’t outdrink you, then I’ll lie on the ground and bark like a dog!”
